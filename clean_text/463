The iPhone 5 is a touchscreen-based smartphone developed by Apple. It is the sixth generation of the iPhone and succeeds the iPhone 4S. The phone is a slimmer, lighter model that introduces a higher-resolution, 4-inch screen to the series with 16:9 widescreen aspect ratio. The phone also includes a custom-designed ARMv7 processor called the Apple A6, an update to Apple's mobile operating system known as iOS 6, and support for LTE.
Apple held an event to formally introduce the phone on September 12, 2012. After Apple began taking pre-orders on September 14, 2012, over two million were received within 24 hours. Initial demand for the iPhone 5 exceeded the supply available at launch on September 21, 2012, and has been described by Apple as &quot;extraordinary&quot;, with pre-orders having sold twenty times faster than its predecessors. After the launch of the device, Samsung filed a lawsuit against Apple, claiming that the iPhone 5 infringes eight of its patents.
While reception to the iPhone 5 has been generally positive, the new Maps application has been negatively received and was reported to contain many serious errors. Several hardware issues have also received criticism from consumers and reviewers, including an unintended purple hue in photos taken by the iPhone 5, an issue with its coating being prone to chipping, and the presence of light leaks on white variants of the device. Incompatibilities with LTE networks in some regions have been noted.
History


Rumors about the  began shortly after the announcement of the iPhone 4S, though detailed leaks did not emerge until June 2012.1 On July 30, 2012, reports pinpointed the dates that the iPhone 5 would be unveiled and released on, along with some accurate predictions of its features.2 On September 4, 2012, Apple announced they would be hosting an event at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco on September 12, 2012. A shadow of the number 5 was featured in the invitations sent to the media, suggesting that the next iPhone would be unveiled at the event.3
At the unveiling, Apple announced the iPhone 5 and also introduced new iPod Nano and iPod Touch models. They also stated that pre-orders would be accepted starting September 14, 2012.4 Over two million pre-orders were received within 24 hours.5 Initial demand for the new phone exceeded the record set by its predecessor, the iPhone 4S, by selling over 5 million units in the first three days.6 On November 30, 2012, Apple added an unlocked version of the iPhone 5 to their online US store, with the 16 GB model starting at US$649.78
Litigation

Following the release of the iPhone 5, Samsung announced that it was filing a lawsuit against Apple for infringing eight of its patents. The case is scheduled to begin in 2014.9 In a statement, Samsung said, it had &quot;little choice but to take the steps necessary to protect our innovations and intellectual property rights&quot;.10 Litigation between the two involving patent infringement has been ongoing and is being fought in several court cases around the world. Apple has won preliminary injunctions against the Galaxy Nexus smartphone co-developed by Samsung. In August 2012, Apple added the Samsung Galaxy S III to a list of models it also claims infringe its patents.11
Production
The components and labor required to construct the most basic iPhone 5 is estimated to cost US$207, which is US$19 more than the cost of components for the corresponding iPhone 4S model. The LTE module in the iPhone 5 alone costs $34, $10 more than the cellular module in the iPhone 4S. Similarly, screens used in the iPhone 5 costs $44, which is $7 more than the screen of its predecessor. Mashable noted that the profit margin of selling each device is &quot;huge&quot; as the iPhone 5 retails for US$649.1213
Subsequently after the announcement of the device, a lack of supply of the iPhone 5 was evident. This was due to a shortage of components such as the screen; reports emerged, stating that Sharp was unable to ship the screen before the debut of the iPhone 5 and other manufacturers reported that it was difficult to keep up with demand. As a result, the number of pre-orders rose due to the uncertainty of stock at retail stores and the delivery dates for pre-orders were postponed to dates that were after the initial release date of the device.14
Quality control inspectors strike
China Labor Watch reported that &lt;U+201C&gt;three to four thousand&lt;U+201D&gt; Foxconn workers who work at iPhone 5 production plant in Zhengzhou stopped working on October 5, 2012.15 The strikes occurred after Apple implemented a stricter quality standard on their products, which include a 0.02 mm restriction on indentations inflicted during production and imposed demands related to scratches on frames and back cover.16 The strikes were also attributed to the employer forcing employees to work on a public holiday. The report stated training was inadequate for quality demands expected and led to employees producing products that did not meet standards. During the strike, conflicts between quality control inspectors and employees resulted in brawls. China Labor Watch also claimed that concerns raised by inspectors were not addressed by factory management.17 Foxconn spokesman admitted that a problem in the micromanagement exists, but also said that there were only 300 to 400 workers absent and the conflicts did not influence production processes.18 In November 2012, Foxconn chairman, Terry Gou reported that the delay in production was due to undisclosed difficulties in assembly.19
Features
Operating system and software


The  uses iOS, Apple's mobile operating system.20 The user interface of iOS is based on the concept of direct manipulation, using multi-touch gestures. Interface control elements consist of sliders, switches, and buttons.21 Interaction with the OS includes gestures such as swipe, tap, pinch, and reverse pinch, all of which have specific definitions within the context of the iOS operating system and its multi-touch interface. Internal accelerometers are used by some applications to respond to shaking the device (one common result is the undo command) or rotating it vertically (one common result is switching from portrait to landscape mode).22
The iPhone 5 is shipped with iOS 6, which was released on September 19, 2012.23 Many of the 's features that work specifically with the included iOS 6.0 operating system only worked in certain territories on release.24 Apple has said this is a rolling program, which will take longer to implement across more regions.25
The phone can act as a hotspot, sharing its internet connection over WiFi, Bluetooth, or USB,26 and also accesses the App Store, an online application distribution platform for iOS developed and maintained by Apple. The service allows users to browse and download applications from the iTunes Store that were developed with Xcode and the iOS SDK and were published through Apple.
The  can play music, movies, television shows, ebooks, audiobooks, and podcasts and can sort its media library by songs, artists, albums, videos, playlists, genres, composers, podcasts, audiobooks, and compilations. Options are always presented alphabetically, except in playlists, which retain their order from iTunes.27 Users can rotate their device horizontally to landscape mode to access Cover Flow. Like on iTunes, this feature shows the different album covers in a scroll-through photo library. Scrolling is achieved by swiping a finger across the screen. Alternatively, headset controls can be used to pause, play, skip, and repeat tracks. On the 5, the volume can be changed with the included Apple Earphones, and the Voice Control feature can be used to identify a track, play songs in a playlist or by a specific artist, or create a Genius playlist.28
Like the iPhone 4S, the iPhone 5 has Siri,29 that allows the user to operate the iPhone by spoken commands. The software was improved in iOS 6 to include the ability to make restaurant reservations, launch apps, dictate Facebook or Twitter updates, retrieve movie reviews and detailed sports statistics.30
On the , texting can be aided by the voice assistant, which converts speech to text.31 In addition to regular texting, messaging on the  supports iMessage, a specialized instant messaging program and service that allows unlimited texting to other Apple devices running iOS 5 or later. This supports the inclusion of content such as images and sound in text messages, integration with the device's voice-controlled software assistant, and read acknowledgements for sent messages. Input to the device comes from a keyboard displayed on the multi-touch screen or by voice-to text by speaking into the microphone. Entered text is supported by predictive and suggestion software; there is a multi-language spell-checker which recognises many regional accents of different languages.32
iOS 6 features several new and/or updated apps, which includes Apple Maps and Passbook. Apple's built-in Maps app, which replaced the former Maps app powered by Google Maps, has been universally derided and lacks many features present in competing maps apps. It is also known to give inaccurate directions.3334 It uses Apple&lt;U+2019&gt;s new vector-based engine that eliminates lag, making for smoother zooming. New to Maps is turn-by-turn navigation spoken directions, 3D views in some major cities and real-time traffic.3536 iOS 6 is able to retrieve documents such as boarding passes, admission tickets, coupons and loyalty cards through its new Passbook app. An iOS device with Passbook can be scanned under a reader to process a mobile payment at locations that have compatible hardware. The app has context-aware features such as notifications for relevant coupons when in the immediate vicinity of a given store.3738
Facebook comes integrated through Apple&lt;U+2019&gt;s native apps with iOS 6. Facebook features can be directly accessed from within native apps such as Calendar which can sync Facebook events, or use Facebook&lt;U+2019&gt;s like button from within the Apple App Store.39
New privacy settings are available to the user. In addition to location services, the following have been added in iOS 6: photos (already partially restricted in iOS 5), contacts (address book), calendars, reminders, bluetooth sharing, Twitter, Facebook, and Sina Weibo. iOS 6 also comes with a &lt;U+201C&gt;Limit ad tracking&lt;U+201D&gt; user control in the general settings menu to allow users the option to prevent targeted advertising. Apple&lt;U+2019&gt;s Advertising Identifier replaces the company&lt;U+2019&gt;s existing Unique Device Identification (UDID) standard. Advertising networks not yet using Apple&lt;U+2019&gt;s Advertising Identifier device identifier standard would not be affected, although Apple will require the standard in the future.40
Design
Apple emphasized the improved build quality of the iPhone 5 at its press event.41 The frame used in previous versions was redesigned to use an aluminum composite frame.42 The  and  used stainless steel instead of aluminium due to Steve Jobs' preference for the metal which he thought, &quot;looks beautiful when it wears&quot;.4344
All versions of the  are 18% thinner, 20% lighter, and have 12% less overall volume than its predecessor, the iPhone 4S. The phone's aluminum body is  thick. Apple at the conference claims it is the thinnest smartphone in the world at 7.6 mm, though that claim has been disputed as the Oppo Finder is thinner and some other smartphones can be considered to be thinner, depending upon where thickness is measured. The Oppo Finder measures 6.65 mm at its thinnest point and 7.1 mm at its thickest point making it overall thinner than the iPhone.454647
Hardware

Apple's A6 chip is 22% smaller than the A5 and consumes less power.

The  features an improved system on chip (SoC), called the Apple A6.484950 The SoC comprises a 1.3 GHz dual-core processor, 1GB of RAM and a tri-core PowerVR SGX543MP4 running at 266 MHz.5152 The 's operating memory (LPDDR2-1066 eDRAM) was doubled, from 512 MB to 1 GB. Storage capacities available are fixed at 16, 32 or 64 GB, the same as the 4S; plug-in memory cards are not supported.53 The two color options are black (with black glass and slate-colored metal trim), and white (with white ceramic and silver-colored metal trim); again the same color options (though differently implemented) as its predecessor the 4S had.54 The iPhone 5 retains the 8 MP back camera on the iPhone 4S, but has improved low-light performance, and has a 40% faster photo capture55 than its predecessors, while having a purple hue when a strong source of light is present in the photograph.56 The front camera, which is accessible through the FaceTime and camera app has a lower resolution, at 1.2 megapixels. The rechargeable lithium-ion polymer battery with a charge capacity of 1440mAh57 is built in and cannot be replaced by the user; it is rated at &lt;U+2264&gt;225 hours of standby time and &lt;U+2264&gt;8 hours of talk time. There are three separate models of the phone available: one supporting CDMA and two GSM versions.5859 This can have knock-on effects for which version of the device will actually work in which countries/regions. The phone takes a nano-SIM, smaller than the micro-SIM of the  and .60
Hardware benchmarking conducted using Geekbench and GLBenchmark validates several claims that Apple included on their website and mentioned at the unveiling of the device, these include two times faster and two times the graphics performance. In the Geekbench overall hardware assessment, the iPhone 5 received a score that was approximately 2.5 times higher than the iPhone 4S. The benchmark conducted using GLBenchmark for the iPhone 5 returned a score that was 2 times better than the iPhone 4S. The result was however inconsistent as a 3D graphics benchmark assessment using Passmark returned a score that was only approximately 1.45 times better than the iPhone 4S.6162 Battery life assessments conducted by AnandTech concluded that the battery life is shorter on the iPhone 5 than its predecessor when performing certain tasks, however when performing other tasks the iPhone 5 battery outlasts the iPhone 4S.63
The display is 1,136 &lt;U+00D7&gt; 640 pixels with an aspect ratio of almost exactly 16:9, (minus two extra rows of horizontal pixels). With a diagonal of 4&quot; it has a display size of 6.7 square inches, compared to 5.7 in iPhone 4 and 4S.64 The pixel density remains the same as the 4S model, which is 326 pixels per inch. Now, the matrix icons appear as a column 4 of 6 icons, including those located at the bottom. This gives an extra row of icons on the desktop. In-cell touch sensor technology from Sharp allows the screen to be thinner, allowing for a thinner phone. The screen's color saturation is 44% greater than its predecessor.65
There are three microphones &lt;U+2014&gt; placed on the front, side and back &lt;U+2014&gt; for noise cancellation and video calls.66
Peripherals

Apple Lightning connector

The , as well as the iPod Touch (5th generation), iPod Nano (7th generation), iPad (4th generation), and iPad Mini feature a new dock connector named Lightning, which replaces the 30-pin Apple Dock connector introduced in 2003 by Apple on the iPod (3rd generation). The Apple Lightning connector has eight pins and all signaling is digital. This new connector is smaller than the previous one, helping the  to be slimmer than its predecessors.67 Apple Lightning cables have duplicate pins on two sides of each plug, so it can be inserted either way round. Various accessories will be available to convert the Apple Lightning connector to the older 30-pin Apple Dock connector or USB,68 although not all old accessories will work, as not all signals are available, in particular video output and the iPod Out feature for BMW automobiles.697071
Earphones known as Apple EarPods are included with the iPhone 5 and other devices announced at the Apple media event on September 12, 2012. They superseded earphones that were included with previous generation iPhones and iPods.72 According to technology commentators, the redesign of the earphones is aimed to improve sound quality by allowing air to travel in and out more freely.7374 Apple claims that the redesign of their earphones allows it to &quot;rival high-end headphones that cost hundreds of dollars more&quot;.75 Reviews by Gizmodo and TechRadar concluded that although the redesigned earphones sounded better than its predecessor, the quality of sound produced is still considered poor.76 TechRadar further claimed that the EarPods is inferior to other earphones of a similar price.77
LTE reception and usability

AT&amp;T, Verizon, and Sprint offer LTE access in the US,78 while in the UK, only EE is able to offer LTE access.79 All carriers in Canada selling the  have their own LTE networks, including Rogers Wireless, Fido Solutions, Bell Mobility, Virgin Mobile Canada, Telus Mobility and Koodo Mobile.8081
42 officially recognized bands exist for LTE, however rollouts are coalescing around the more-popular bands, based on what historically has been made available in specific regions. In Europe, bands available for LTE include, 2.6 GHz (the 3G-expansion band) and 800 MHz (cleared of analogue TV), with 1,800 MHz appearing in a few places including the UK. In Germany, the only carrier network supported is that of T-Mobile with its 1,800 MHz band allocated to LTE.8283 Some countries in Europe, including Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and others&lt;U+2014&gt;will not be able to offer LTE connectivity via the iPhone 5 to their customers on their current LTE networks, as they have already deployed LTE in the 2.6 GHz band, which the iPhone 5 does not support.84
Unlike the iPhone 4S, which was the only &quot;world phone&quot; produced by Apple, there are three versions of the iPhone 5, which differ by the frequency used. All three work on 2G GSM/GPRS and 3G UMTS/EDGE networks on both the 800 and 1900 MHz bands used in the Americas, and the 900 and 1800 MHz bands used elsewhere. The CDMA A1429 model works on CDMA networks, such as that of Sprint and Verizon. Another version supports LTE only on the 1700/2100 MHz AWS band, and the 700 MHz band recovered after the forced conversion to digital television in the US (channels 52 to 56), currently the only network that supports the band is AT&amp;T. GSM A1429 supports several other LTE bands available in other countries, such as LTE bands 1, 3, 5.8586
Reception
Critical reception
 The  received mainly positive reviews from commentators and reviewers. Tim Stevens from Engadget praised the  for its high resolution screen surpassing that of the , which he considered to be one of the best phone screens available on the market. Stevens was critical of the new connector, which is incompatible with devices and cables that use the superseded 30 pin connector, although the LA Times reported that this was a change necessary to make the device smaller than its predecessor.87 Engadget agreed that Apple fulfilled most of the promises stated on its website, such as &quot;better battery performance&quot;, &quot;two times the graphics performance&quot; and &quot;two times faster.&quot;88 David Pogue of The New York Times considered the 4-inch Retina display a &quot;nice but not life-changing change&quot;, and praised the Lightning connector for its size, sturdiness, and reversibility, while noting its lack of support for older accessories, remarking that &quot;Apple has a long history of killing off technologies, inconveniently and expensively, that the public had come to love&quot;.89 Technology columnist Ed Baig of USA Today was impressed that Apple had met the public's &quot;lofty expectations&quot; for the iPhone 5 in a competitive market.90 In a repair-ability review, iFixit found the iPhone 5 easier to disassemble and repair than its predecessor.9192
Reviewers and commentators were critical of the new Maps app that replaced Google Maps in iOS 6. It had been reported to contain errors such as misplacement of landmark tags, directing users to incorrect locations and poor satellite images.939495 Nine days after Maps' release, Apple issued a statement apologizing for the frustration it had caused customers and recommending that they try alternate mapping services.96
Gizmodo editor Diaz discussed the correspondence between Apple and a reader about purple flare in pictures taken on iPhone 5 camera. Apple's response to the issue was that it is normal and advised the customer to aim the camera away from bright light sources when taking photos.97 Tests conducted by TechCrunch indicate that the problem existed on the iPhone 4S but was more distinct and pronounced on the iPhone 5.98 Consumer Reports found that the purple haze effect occurred on several other manufacturers' phones including the Samsung Galaxy S III and Motorola Droid Razr Maxx, and that it was not less pronounced on the iPhone 4S. The report concluded that digital cameras in general, including higher-end SLRs, can all suffer from lens flare in which a purple-tinted effect was not uncommon.99
The coating on the black and white models chipped off easily on some devices, exposing the bright aluminium underneath,100 and an Apple executive's response to email correspondence from an affected customer summarized that it was normal for aluminum to scratch.101102103 The term &quot;scuffgate&quot;, a reference to &quot;antennagate&quot; which affected the iPhone 4, was applied by various sources such as CNET, Yahoo News, and All Things Digital to describe the scuffing issue.104105
The white model has been reported to leak light behind the screen, though the issue is not unique to the iPhone 5, as it also affects other Apple devices.106
Commercial reception
J.P. Morgan's chief economist, Michael Ferol said that &quot;sales of  could boost annualized US GDP growth by $3.2 billion, or $12.8 billion at an annual rate.&quot;107
Techcrunch reported that the  sold out twenty times faster than the 4 and 4S models. Apple said that they were &quot;blown away by the customer response&quot;.108 Phil Schiller, Apple's vice-president of worldwide marketing, said that over two million  orders had been received in the first 24 hours.109110 AT&amp;T said that the  was the fastest-selling iPhone the company had ever offered, selling over five million units on launch weekend and exceeding the supply available.111112113 The release and sale of the iPhone 5 has also slowed down the growth of Android according to market share reports released by Kantar Worldpanel ComTech.114
Shortly after the announcement of the iPhone 5 and preceding the launch, Apple's stock price rose to a record $705.07,115 but within three months fell to $507.48.116 Apple reportedly lost $30 billion in revenue. According to the analysis of Eric Savitz, Apple's stock decline and resulting losses were not the result of any issue with the new Maps application, but disappointed investors. He points to initial hardware sales of only five million, compared to projections up to twice that, as the primary cause.117
