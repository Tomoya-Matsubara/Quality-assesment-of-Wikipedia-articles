Michael Joseph Jackson (born August 29, 1958) is a US musician and entertainer. The seventh child of the Jackson family, he debuted on the professional music scene at the age of 11 as a member of The Jackson 5 and began a solo career in 1971 while still a member of the group. In the early 1980s, he became a dominant figure in popular music as the first African-American entertainer to amass a strong crossover following on MTV. Referred to as the &quot;King of Pop&quot; in subsequent years, five of his solo studio albums have become some of the world's best-selling records: Off the Wall (1979), Thriller (1982), Bad (1987), Dangerous (1991) and HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I (1995).
The popularity of his music videos airing on MTV, such as &quot;Beat It&quot;, &quot;Billie Jean&quot; and Thriller&lt;U+2014&gt;credited for transforming the music video into an art form and a promotional tool&lt;U+2014&gt;helped bring the relatively new channel to fame. Videos such as &quot;Black or White&quot; and &quot;Scream&quot; kept Jackson as a staple on MTV into the 1990s. With stage performances and music videos, Jackson popularized a number of physically complicated dance techniques, such as the robot and the moonwalk. His distinctive musical sound and vocal style influenced numerous hip hop, pop and contemporary R&amp;B artists.
Jackson has donated and raised millions of dollars for beneficial causes through his Dangerous World Tour, charity singles and support of 39 charities.1 However, other aspects of his personal life&lt;U+2014&gt;including his plastic surgery, his lightening skin, and his eccentric behavior&lt;U+2014&gt;have generated significant controversy and have damaged his public image. He was accused of child sexual abuse in 1993, although the matter was settled out of court. Jackson then married twice and fathered three children, all of which caused further controversy. In 2005, Jackson was tried and later acquitted of further sexual abuse allegations and several other charges. He has experienced health concerns since the early 1990s and reported financial difficulties since the late 1990s.
One of the few artists to have been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice, his other achievements include multiple Guinness World Records&lt;U+2014&gt;including one for Thriller as the world's best-selling album&lt;U+2014&gt;13 Grammy Awards, 13 number one singles in his solo career&lt;U+2014&gt;more than any other male artist after the creation of the Billboard Hot 100&lt;U+2014&gt;and the sale of over 750 million units worldwide. Jackson's highly publicized personal life, coupled with his successful career, has made him a part of popular culture for almost four decades.
Biography
1958&lt;U+2013&gt;1975: Early life and The Jackson 5

Michael Joseph Jackson was born in Gary, Indiana (an industrial suburb of Chicago, Illinois) to a working-class family on August 29, 1958.2 The son of Joseph &quot;Joe&quot; Walter and Katherine Esther (n&lt;U+00E9&gt;e Scruse),3 he is the seventh of nine children. His siblings are Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, Marlon, Randy, Janet, La Toya and Rebbie.4 Joseph Jackson was a steel mill employee who often performed in an R&amp;B band called The Falcons with his brother Luther.5 Jackson was raised a Jehovah's Witness.6
From a young age Jackson was physically and mentally abused by his father, enduring incessant rehearsals, whippings and name-calling. Jackson's abuse as a child affected him throughout his grown life.7 In one altercation&lt;U+2014&gt;later recalled by Marlon Jackson&lt;U+2014&gt;Joseph held Michael upside down by one leg and &quot;pummelled him over and over again with his hand, hitting him on his back and buttocks&quot;.8 Joseph would often trip up, or push the male children into walls.9 One night while Jackson was asleep, Joseph climbed into his room through the bedroom window. Wearing a fright mask, he entered the room screaming and shouting. Joseph said he wanted to teach his children not to leave the window open when they went to sleep. For years afterward, Jackson suffered nightmares about being kidnapped from his bedroom.10
Jackson first spoke openly about his childhood abuse in a 1993 interview with Oprah Winfrey. He said that during his childhood he often cried from loneliness and would sometimes get sick or start to regurgitate upon seeing his father.11121314 In Jackson's other high profile interview, Living with Michael Jackson (2003), the singer covered his face with his hand and began crying when talking about his childhood abuse.15 Jackson recalled that Joseph sat in a chair with a belt in his hand as he and his siblings rehearsed and that &quot;[i]f you didn't do it the right way, he would tear you up, really get you.&quot;16
Jackson showed musical talent early in his life, performing in front of classmates and others during a Christmas recital at the age of five.17 In 1964, Jackson and Marlon joined the Jackson Brothers&lt;U+2014&gt;a band formed by brothers Jackie, Tito and Jermaine&lt;U+2014&gt;as backup musicians playing congas and tambourine, respectively. Jackson later began performing backup vocals and dancing; at the age of eight, he and Jermaine assumed lead vocals, and the group's name was changed to The Jackson 5.18 The band toured the Midwest extensively from 1965 to 1967. The band frequently performed at a string of black clubs and venues collectively known as the &quot;chitlin' circuit&quot;, where they often opened for stripteases and other adult acts. In 1966, they won a major local talent show with renditions of Motown hits and James Brown's &quot;I Got You (I Feel Good)&quot;, led by Michael.19
The Jackson 5 recorded several songs for the local record label Steeltown in 1967 and signed with Motown Records in 1968.20 Rolling Stone magazine later described the young Michael as &quot;a prodigy&quot; with &quot;overwhelming musical gifts&quot;, noting that Michael &quot;quickly emerged as the main draw and lead singer&quot; after he began to dance and sing with his brothers.21 Though Michael sang with a &quot;child's piping voice, he danced like a grown-up hoofer and sang with the R&amp;B/gospel inflections of Sam Cooke, James Brown, Ray Charles and Stevie Wonder&quot;.22 The group set a record when its first four singles (&quot;I Want You Back&quot;, &quot;ABC&quot;, &quot;The Love You Save&quot; and &quot;I'll Be There&quot;) charted at number one on the Billboard Hot 100.23 During The Jackson 5's early years, Motown's public relations team claimed that Jackson was nine years old&lt;U+2014&gt;two years younger than he actually was&lt;U+2014&gt;to make him appear cuter and more accessible to the mainstream audience.24 Starting in 1972, Jackson released a total of four solo studio albums with Motown, among them Got to Be There and Ben. These were released as part of the Jackson 5 franchise, and produced successful singles such as &quot;Got to Be There&quot;, &quot;Ben&quot; and a remake of Bobby Day's &quot;Rockin' Robin&quot;. The group's sales began declining in 1973, and the band members chafed under Motown's strict refusal to allow them creative control or input.25 Although the group scored several top 40 hits, including the top 5 disco single &quot;Dancing Machine&quot; and the top 20 hit &quot;I Am Love&quot;, the Jackson 5 left Motown in 1975.26
1976&lt;U+2013&gt;1981: Move to Epic and Off the Wall
The Jackson 5 signed a new contract with CBS Records in June 1975, joining first the Philadelphia International Records division and then Epic Records.27 As a result of legal proceedings, the group was renamed The Jacksons.28 After the name change, the band continued to tour internationally, releasing six more albums between 1976 and 1984. From 1976 to 1984, Michael Jackson was the lead songwriter of the group, writing hits such as &quot;Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground)&quot;, &quot;This Place Hotel&quot; and &quot;Can You Feel It&quot;.29
In 1978, Jackson starred as Scarecrow in the film musical The Wiz.30 The musical scores were arranged by Quincy Jones, who formed a partnership with Jackson during the film's production and agreed to produce the singer's solo album Off the Wall.31 In 1979, Jackson broke his nose during a complex dance routine. His subsequent rhinoplasty surgery was not a complete success, and Jackson complained of breathing difficulties that would affect his career. He was referred to Dr. Steven Hoefflin, who performed Jackson's second rhinoplasty and other subsequent operations.32
Jones and Jackson jointly produced Off the Wall, whose songwriters included Jackson, Heatwave's Rod Temperton, Stevie Wonder and Paul McCartney. Released in 1979, Off the Wall was the first album to generate four US top 10 hits, including the chart-topping singles &quot;Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough&quot; and &quot;Rock with You&quot;.33 Off the Wall reached number three on the Billboard 20034 and eventually sold over 15 million copies worldwide.35 In 1980, Jackson won three awards at the American Music Awards for his solo efforts: Favorite Soul/R&amp;B Album, Favorite Male Soul/R&amp;B Artist and Favorite Soul/R&amp;B Single (for &quot;Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough&quot;).36 That year, he also won Billboard Music Awards for Top Black Artist and Top Black Album and a Grammy Award for Best Male R&amp;B Vocal Performance (for &quot;Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough&quot;).37 Despite its commercial success, Jackson felt Off the Wall should have made a much bigger impact, and was determined to exceed expectations with his next release.38
1982&lt;U+2013&gt;1985: Thriller
In 1982, Jackson contributed the song &quot;Someone In the Dark&quot; to the storybook for the film E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial; the record won a Grammy for Best Album for Children.39 That year Jackson issued his second Epic album, Thriller. The New York Times called him a &quot;musical phenomenon&quot;, saying that &quot;in the world of pop music, there is Michael Jackson and there is everybody else&quot;.40 The album remained in the top 10 of the Billboard 200 for 80 consecutive weeks there and 37 of those weeks at the peak position. It was the first album to have seven Billboard Hot 100 top 10 singles, including &quot;Billie Jean&quot;, &quot;Beat It&quot; and Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'.41 Thriller was certified for 27 million shipments by the RIAA, giving it Double Diamond status in the US.4243 It is often cited as the best-selling album of all time, with worldwide sales between 47 million and 104 million copies.4445  On March 25, 1983, Jackson performed live on the Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever television special, both with The Jackson 5 and on his own singing &quot;Billie Jean&quot;. Debuting his signature dance move&lt;U+2014&gt;the moonwalk&lt;U+2014&gt;his performances during the event were seen by 47 million viewers during its initial airing, and drew comparions to Elvis Presley's and the The Beatles' appearances on The Ed Sullivan Show.46 The New York Times said, &quot;The moonwalk that he made famous is an apt metaphor for his dance style. How does he do it? As a technician, he is a great illusionist, a genuine mime. His ability to keep one leg straight as he glides while the other bends and seems to walk requires perfect timing&quot;.47
Jackson suffered a setback on January 27, 1984. While filming a Pepsi Cola commercial at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles, Jackson suffered second degree burns to his scalp after pyrotechnics accidentally set his hair on fire. Happening in front of a full house of fans during a simulated concert, the incident was the subject of heavy media scrutiny and elicited an outpouring of sympathy.48 PepsiCo settled a lawsuit out of court, and Jackson gave his $1.5 million settlement to the &quot;Michael Jackson Burn Center&quot; which was a piece of new technology to help people with severe burns.287&quot;/&gt; Jackson had his third rhinoplasty shortly afterward and grew self conscious about his appearance.210&quot;/&gt;
On May 14, 1984, Jackson was invited to the White House to receive an award presented by American President Ronald Reagan. The award was given for Jackson's support of charities that helped people overcome alcohol and drug abuse.49 Jackson won eight awards during the 1984 Grammys. Unlike later albums, Thriller did not have an official tour to promote it, but the 1984 Victory Tour, headlined by The Jacksons, showcased much of Jackson's new solo material to more than two million Americans.50 He donated his five million dollar share from the Victory Tour to charity.51
Jackson changed the way the industry functioned; as an artistic entity and a financial, profitable organisation. His attorney John Branca noted that Jackson had the highest royalty rate in the music industry at that point; approximately $2 for every album sold. He was also making record breaking profit from compact discs or the sale of The Making of Michael Jackson's Thriller; a documentary produced by Jackson and John Landis. Funded by MTV, the documentary sold over 350,000 copies in a few months of sale. The era saw the arrival of novelties like the Michael Jackson doll, that appeared in stores in May 1984 at a price of $12.52 Thriller retains a position in American culture; biographer J. Randy Taraborrelli explains, &quot;At some point, Thriller stopped selling like a leisure item&lt;U+2014&gt;like a magazine, a toy, tickets to a hit movie&lt;U+2014&gt;and started selling like a household staple.&quot;53
Gil Friesen, President of A&amp;M Records, said &quot;the whole industry has a stake in this success&quot;.54 Thriller raised the importance of albums, but multiple hits also changed notions about the number of singles to release.55 Time magazine explained that &quot;the fallout from Thriller has given the [music] business its best years since the heady days of 1978, when it had an estimated total domestic revenue of $4.1 billion&quot;.56 Time summed up Thriller's impact as a &quot;restoration of confidence&quot; for an industry bordering on &quot;the ruins of punk and the chic regions of synthesizer pop&quot;. The publication described Jackson's influence at that point as &quot;Star of records, radio, rock video. A one-man rescue team for the music business. A songwriter who sets the beat for a decade. A dancer with the fanciest feet on the street. A singer who cuts across all boundaries of taste and style and color too&quot;.57 According to the The Washington Post, Thriller paved the way for other acts such as Prince.58
With help from Lionel Richie, Jackson co-wrote the charity single &quot;We Are the World&quot;, released worldwide to aid people in Africa and the US. Jackons was one of many music celebrities who performed on the record. Released in March 1985, the single became one of the best-selling singles of all time, with nearly 20 million copies sold and millions of dollars raised for charity. It was the first time Jackson was seen as a humanitarian.59 The singer purchased Northern Songs, a music catalog holding thousands of songs. The catalog includes The Beatles' back catalog and songs by Elvis Presley.60 Jackson outbid Paul McCartney and Yoko Ono at a cost of $47.5 million.61 The idea came to Jackson while working on the hit single &quot;Say Say Say&quot; with McCartney a few years prior. The pair became friendly, occasionally visiting one another. In one discussion, McCartney told Jackson about the millions of dollars he had made from music catalogs; he was earning approximately $40 million a year from other peoples songs.62
Jackson began a business career buying music and shortly afterward Northern Songs was put up for sale. He was warned that he would face strong competition, excited, he skipped around the room saying, &quot;I don't care. I want those songs. Get me those songs Branca [his attorney]&quot;. Branca then contacted the attorney of McCartney, who clarified that his client was not interested in bidding because, &quot;It's too pricey&quot;. After Jackson had started negotiations, McCartney changed his mind and tried to persuade Yoko Ono to join him in a joint bid, she declined, so he pulled out. Jackson eventually beat off the rest of the competition in negotiations that lasted 10 months. When McCartney found out he said, &quot;I think it's dodgy to do things like that. To be someones friend and then buy the rug they're standing on&quot;. Reacting to that statement, biographer J. Randy Taraborrelli observed that McCartney made millions of dollars from the music of other people. He had more money than Jackson at that point so could have made a substantial bid for his own music and would not have suffered financial danger from Jackson owning the catalog.63
1986&lt;U+2013&gt;1990: Bad, autobiography and films

In 1986, the tabloid press ran a story claiming that Jackson slept in a hyperbaric oxygen chamber to slow the aging process; he was pictured lying down in a glass box. Although the claim was untrue, Jackson disseminated the fabricated story himself. The singer was promoting his upcoming movie Captain EO and wanted to promote a sci-fi imagine of himself.6465 Jackson had a fourth rhinoplasty and, wanting masculine features, had a cleft put in his chin.210&quot;/&gt; Then he starred in the Francis Ford Coppola-directed 3-D film Captain EO. It was the most expensive film produced on a per-minute basis at the time, and was later hosted in Disney theme parks. Disneyland featured the film in its Tomorrowland area for nearly 11 years, while Walt Disney World screened the film in its Epcot theme park from 1986 to 1994.66  Jackson bought and befriended a pet chimpanzee called Bubbles which extended his eccentric persona, in 2003 the singer claimed that Bubbles shared his toilet and cleaned his bedroom.67 Later it was reported that Jackson bought the bones of The Elephant Man. Although untrue, it was a story that Jackson again disseminated to the tabloid press.6869 These stories inspired the pejorative nickname &quot;Wacko Jacko&quot;, which Jackson acquired the following year. He would eventually come to despise the nickname. Realizing his mistake, he stopped leaking untruths to the press. However due to the profit being made, the media began making up their own stories.7071
Jackson's skin was a medium-brown color for the entire duration of his youth, but starting in the early 1980s, his skin gradually grew paler. This change gained widespread media coverage, including rumors that Jackson was bleaching his skin.72 In the mid-1980s, Jackson was diagnosed with vitiligo and lupus; the latter is in remission in Jackson's case, both illnesses make him sensitive to sunlight. The treatments he uses for his condition further lighten his skin tone, and, with the application of pancake makeup to even out blotches, he can appear very pale.73 The structure of his face has changed as well; several surgeons have speculated that Jackson had undergone multiple nasal surgeries, a forehead lift, thinned lips and a cheekbone surgery.74 Changes to his face were, in part, due to periods of significant weight loss.144&quot;/&gt; Jackson became slimmer in the early 1980s because of a change in diet and a desire for &quot;a dancer's body&quot;.210&quot;/&gt; Witnesses reported that Jackson was often dizzy and speculated that he was suffering from anorexia nervosa; periods of weight loss would became a recurring problem for the singer later in life.75 Some medical professionals have publicly stated their belief that the singer has body dysmorphic disorder, a psychological condition whereby the sufferer has no concept of how they are perceived by others.76

With the industry expecting another major hit, Jackson's first album in five years, Bad (1987), was highly anticipated.77 Bad had lower sales than Thriller, but was still a significant commercial success. In the US, it spawned seven hit singles, five of which (&quot;I Just Can't Stop Loving You&quot;, &quot;Bad&quot;, &quot;The Way You Make Me Feel&quot;, &quot;Man in the Mirror&quot; and &quot;Dirty Diana&quot;) went to number one on the Billboard Hot 100 charts, more than any other album.78 The album sold over 25 million copies worldwide, and shipped eight million units in the US.79611&quot;/&gt;
The Bad World Tour began on September 12, 1987, and finished on January 14, 1989.80 In Japan alone, the tour had 14 sellouts and drew 570,000 people, nearly tripling the previous record of 200,000 in a single tour.81 Jackson broke a Guinness World Record when 504,000 people attended seven sold-out shows at Wembley Stadium. He performed a total of 123 concerts to a total audience of 4.4 million people, and gained a further Guinness World Record when the tour grossed him $125 million. During the trip he invited underprivileged children to watch for free and gave donations to hospitals, orphanages and other charities.82
In 1988, Jackson released his first autobiography, Moonwalk, which took four years to complete. Jackson told of his childhood, his experience in The Jackson 5 and the abuse he suffered as a child. He also spoke of his plastic surgery, saying he had two rhinoplastic surgeries and the surgical creation of a cleft in his chin. In the book, he attributed the change in the structure of his face to puberty and a strict vegetarian diet.210&quot;/&gt; Moonwalk reached the top position on The New York Times best sellers' list.83 The musician then released a film called Moonwalker, which featured live footage, music videos, and a feature film that starred Jackson and Joe Pesci. Moonwalker debuted atop the Billboard Top Music Video Cassette chart, staying there for 22 weeks. It was eventually knocked off the top spot by Michael Jackson: The Legend Continues.84
In late 1988, Jackson purchased land near Santa Ynez, California to build Neverland Ranch at a cost of $17 million. It is a 2,700-acre property complete with Ferris wheels, an exotic menagerie, a movie theater and a security staff of 40. The property was valued at approximately $100 million in 2003.8586 In 1989, his annual earnings from album sales, endorsements and concerts was estimated at $125 million for that year alone.87
Jackson's success resulted in his being dubbed the &quot;King of Pop&quot;, a nickname conceived by actress and friend Elizabeth Taylor when she presented Jackson with an &quot;Artist of the Decade&quot; award in 1989, proclaiming him &quot;the true king of pop, rock and soul&quot;.8889 President George H. W. Bush presented the singer with The White House's special &quot;Artist of the Decade&quot; award in recognition of Jackson's musical influence in the 1980s; Bush commended Jackson for acquiring a &quot;tremendous following&quot; among other achievements.90 From 1985 to 1990, Jackson donated $500,000 to the United Negro College Fund, and all of the profits from his single &quot;Man in the Mirror&quot; went to charity.9192
1991&lt;U+2013&gt;1992: Dangerous
In 1991, Jackson renewed his contract with Sony for $65 million; a record breaking deal at the time.93 Jackson released his eighth album Dangerous in 1991. The Dangerous album had 7 million shipments in the US and sold 27 million copies worldwide; its sales were slightly higher than Bad's.611&quot;/&gt;94 In the US, the album's first single &quot;Black or White&quot; was the album's biggest hit, reaching number one on the Billboard Hot 100 and remaining there for seven weeks, with similar chart performances worldwide.95 The album's second single &quot;Remember the Time&quot; spent eight weeks in the top five in the US, peaking at number three on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart.96 In 1993, Jackson performed the song at the Soul Train Awards in a wheelchair, saying he had suffered an injury in rehearsals.97 In the UK and other parts of Europe, &quot;Heal the World&quot; was the biggest hit from the album; it sold 450,000 copies alone and spent five weeks at two in 1992.98
Jackson founded the &quot;Heal the World Foundation&quot; in 1992. The charity organization brought underprivileged children to Jackson's Neverland Ranch, located outside Santa Ynez, California, to go on theme park rides that Jackson had built on the property after he purchased it in 1988. The foundation also sent millions of dollars around the globe to help children threatened by war and disease. The Dangerous World Tour began on June 27, 1992, and finished on November 11, 1993. Jackson performed to 3.5 million people in 67 concerts. All profits from the concerts went to the &quot;Heal the World Foundation&quot;, raising million of dollars in relief.99 He sold the broadcast rights to his Dangerous world tour to HBO for $20 million, a record-breaking deal that still stands.454&quot;/&gt; Following the illness and death of Ryan White, Jackson helped draw public attention to HIV/AIDS, something that was still controversial at the time. He publicly pleaded with the Clinton Administration at Bill Clintons Inaugural Gala to give more money to HIV/AIDS charities and research.100101
In a high-profile visit to Africa, Jackson visited several countries, among them Gabon and Egypt.102 His first stop to Gabon was greeted with a sizable reception of more than 100,000 people in &quot;spiritual bedlam&quot;, some of them carrying signs that read, &quot;Welcome Home Michael&quot;.103 In his trip to the Ivory Coast, Jackson was crowned &quot;King Sani&quot; by a tribal chief.104 He then thanked the dignitaries in French and English, signed official documents formalizing his kingship and sat on a golden throne while presiding over ceremonial dances.105
One of Jackson's most acclaimed performances came during the halftime show at Super Bowl XXVII. As the performances began, Jackson was catapulted onto the stage as fireworks went off behind him. As he landed on the canvass, he maintained a motionless &quot;clenched fist, standing statue stance&quot;, dressed in a gold and black military outfit and sunglasses; he remained completely motionless for several minutes while the crowd cheered. He then slowly removed his sunglasses, threw them away and began to sing and dance. His routine included four songs: &quot;Jam&quot;, &quot;Billie Jean&quot;, &quot;Black or White&quot; and &quot;Heal the World&quot;. It was the first Super Bowl where the audience figures increased during the half-time show, and was viewed by 135 million Americans alone; Jackson's Dangerous album rose 90 places up the album chart.106 Jackson was given the &quot;Living Legend Award&quot; at the 35th Annual Grammy Awards in Los Angeles.107
1993&lt;U+2013&gt;1994: Sexual abuse accusations and marriage

Jackson gave a 90-minute interview with Oprah Winfrey in February 1993, his first television interview since 1979. He grimaced when speaking of his childhood abuse at the hands of his father; he believed he had missed out on much of his childhood years, admitting that he often cried from loneliness. He denied previous tabloid rumors that he bought the bones of the Elephant Man or slept in a hyperbaric oxygen chamber. The entertainer went on to dispel suggestions that he bleached his skin, admitting for the first time that he had vitiligo. The interview was watched by 90 million Americans, becoming the fourth most-viewed non-sport program in US history. It also started a public debate on the topic of vitiligo, a relatively unknown condition before then. Dangerous re-entered the album chart top 10, more than a year after its original release.108109110
Jackson was accused of child sexual abuse by a 13-year-old child named Jordan Chandler and his father Evan Chandler.111 The friendship between Jackson and Evan Chandler broke down. Sometime afterward, Evan Chandler was tape-recorded saying amongst other things, &quot;If I go through with this, I win big-time. There's no way I lose. I will get everything I want and they will be destroyed forever...Michael's career will be over&quot;.112 A year after they had met, under the influence of a controversial sedative, Jordan Chandler told his father that Jackson had touched his penis.113 Evan Chandler and Jackson, represented by their legal teams, then engaged in unsuccessful negotiations to resolve the issue in a financial settlement; the negotiations were initiated by Chandler but Jackson did make several counter offers. Jordan Chandler then told a psychiatrist and later police that he and Jackson had engaged in acts of kissing, masturbation and oral sex, as well as giving a detailed description of what he alleged were the singer's genitals.114
An official investigation began, with Jordan Chandler's mother adamant that there was no wrongdoing on Jackson's part. Neverland Ranch was searched; multiple children and family members strongly denied that he was a pedophile.115 Jackson's image took a further turn for the worse when his older sister La Toya Jackson accused him of being a pedophile, a statement she later retracted.116 Jackson agreed to a 25-minute strip search, conducted at his ranch. The search was required to see if a description provided by Jordan Chandler was accurate. Doctors concluded that there were some strong similarities, but it was not a definitive match.117 Jackson made an emotional public statement on the events; he proclaimed his innocence, criticized what he perceived as biased media coverage and told of his strip search.118
Jackson began taking painkillers, Valium, Xanax and Ativan to deal with the stress of the allegations made against him. By the fall of 1993, Jackson was addicted to the drugs.119 Jackson's health deteriorated to the extent that he canceled the remainder of the Dangerous World Tour and went into drug rehabilitation for a few months.120 The stress of the allegations also caused Jackson to stop eating, losing a large amount of weight.121 With his health in decline, Jackson's friends and legal advisers took over his defense and finances; they called on him to settle the allegations out of court, believing that he could not endure a lengthy trial.122123
Tabloid reaction to the allegations put Jackson in an unfavorable light.124 Complaints about the coverage and media included everything from bias against Jackson, accepting stories of alleged criminal activity for money to engaging in illegal activity themselves.125 On January 1, 1994, Jackson settled with the Chandler family and their legal team out of court, in a civil lawsuit for $22 million. After the settlement Jordan Chandler refused to continue with Police criminal proceedings. Jackson was never charged, and the state closed its criminal investigation, citing lack of evidence.126
Later that year, Jackson married Lisa Marie Presley, daughter of Elvis Presley. They had first met in 1974 during one of Jackson's family engagements at the MGM Grand, and were reconnected through a mutual friend in early 1993.127 They stayed in contact every day over the telephone. As child molestation accusations became public, Jackson became dependent on Lisa Marie for emotional support; she was concerned about his faltering health and addiction to drugs.520&quot;/&gt; Lisa Marie explained, &quot;I believed he didn't do anything wrong and that he was wrongly accused and yes I started falling for him. I wanted to save him. I felt that I could do it.&quot;128 In a phone call he made to her, she described him as high, incoherent and delusional.520&quot;/&gt; Shortly afterward, she tried to persuade Jackson to settle the allegations out of court and go into rehabilitation to recover&lt;U+2014&gt;he subsequently did both.520&quot;/&gt; Jackson proposed to Lisa Marie over the telephone towards the fall of 1993, saying, &quot;If I asked you to marry me, would you do it?&quot;.520&quot;/&gt; Presley and Jackson married in the Dominican Republic in secrecy, the parties denied that they had married for nearly two months.129 The marriage was, in her words, &quot;a married couple's life ... that was sexually active&quot;.130 At the time, the tabloid media speculated that the wedding was a just a ploy to prop up Jackson's public image in light of the sexual abuse allegations.131 Jackson and Presley divorced less than two years later, remaining friendly.132
1995&lt;U+2013&gt;1999: HIStory, second marriage and fatherhood
In 1995, Jackson merged his Northern Songs catalog with Sony's publishing division a decade after he originally purchased it. He retained half-ownership and earning $95 million in the deal as well as the rights to even more songs.133134 He then released the double album HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I. The first disc, HIStory Begins, was a 15-track greatest hits album, and was later released as Greatest Hits &lt;U+2014&gt; HIStory Vol. I in 2001, the second disc, HIStory Continues, contained 15 new songs. The album debuted at number one on the charts and has been certified for seven million shipments in the US.135 It is the best-selling multiple-disc album of all-time, with 18 million copies (36 million units) sold worldwide.136 The album won a Grammy Award for &quot;Best Video of the Year&quot;.137
The first single released from the album was &quot;Scream&quot;, sung and performed with Jackson's youngest sister Janet. The single had the highest debut on the Billboard Hot 100 at number five, and received a Grammy nomination for &quot;Best Pop Collaboration With Vocals&quot;.138 &quot;You Are Not Alone&quot; was the second single released from HIStory; it holds the Guinness World Record for the first song ever to debut at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.139 It was seen as a major artistic and commercial success, receiving a Grammy nomination for &quot;Best Pop Vocal Performance&quot;.50&quot;/&gt; In late 1995, Jackson was rushed to a hospital after collapsing during rehearsals for a televised performance; the incident was caused by a stress related panic attack.140 &quot;Earth Song&quot; was the third single released from HIStory, and topped the UK singles chart for six weeks over Christmas 1995; it sold a million copies, making it Jackson's most successful single in the UK.50&quot;/&gt;
The HIStory World Tour began on September 7, 1996, and finished on October 15, 1997. Jackson performed 82 concerts in 58 cities to over 4.5 million fans. The show, which visited 5 continents and 35 countries, became Jackson's most successful in terms of audience figures; he has not toured since.141 During the Australian leg of the HIStory World Tour, Jackson married dermatologist's nurse, Deborah Jeanne Rowe, with whom he fathered a son, Michael Joseph Jackson, Jr. (also known as &quot;Prince&quot;), and a daughter, Paris Michael Katherine Jackson.581&quot;/&gt;142 The pair first met in the mid-1980s, when Jackson was diagnosed with vitiligo. She spent many years treating his illness as well as providing emotional support, they built a strong friendship, before becoming romantically involved.143 Originally there were no plans to marry, but following Rowe's first pregnancy, Jackson's mother intervened and persuaded them to.144 The couple divorced in 1999, with Rowe giving full custody rights of the children to Jackson, they still remain friends.145
In 1997, Jackson released Blood on the Dance Floor: HIStory in the Mix, which contained re-mixes of hit singles from HIStory and five new songs. The record sold 6 million copies worldwide, becoming a best-selling remix album. It reached number one in the UK, as did the title track.611&quot;/&gt; In the US, the album was certified platinum, but only reached number 24.14650&quot;/&gt; Forbes placed his annual income at $35 million in 1996 and $20 million in 1997.147
Throughout June 1999, Jackson was involved in a number of charitable events. He joined Luciano Pavarotti for a benefit concert in Modena, Italy. The show was in support of the non-profit organization Warchild, and raised a million dollars for the refugees of Kosovo, as well as additional funds for the children of Guatemala.148 Later that month, Jackson organized a set of &quot;Michael Jackson &amp; Friends&quot; benefit concerts in Germany and Korea. Other artists involved included Slash, The Scorpions, Boys II Men, Luther Vandross, Mariah Carey, Andrea Bocelli and Luciano Pavarotti. The proceeds went to the &quot;Nelson Mandela Children's Fund&quot;, the Red Cross and UNESCO.149
2000&lt;U+2013&gt;2002: Label dispute and Invincible
In 2000, Jackson was waiting for the licenses to the masters of his albums to revert back to him; this allowed him to promote his old material how he liked and prevented Sony from getting a cut of the profit. Jackson expected this to occur early in the new millennium, however, due to the fine print and various clauses in the contract, this revert date is still many years away. Jackson began an investigation, and it emerged that the attorney who represented the singer in the deal was also representing Sony, creating a conflict of interest.611&quot;/&gt; Jackson was also concerned about another conflict of interest. For a number of years, Sony had been pushing to buy all of the Northern Songs catalog from the singer. If Jackson's career or financial situation were to deteriorate, he would have to sell his catalog. Thus, Sony had something to gain from Jackson's career failing.617&quot;/&gt; Jackson was able to use these conflicts as leverage to exit his contract early.611&quot;/&gt; Just before the release of Invincible, Jackson informed the head of Sony Music Entertainment, Tommy Mottola, that he was leaving Sony.611&quot;/&gt; As a result, all singles releases, video shootings and promotions concerning the Invincible album were canceled. Jackson made allegations in July 2002 that Mottola was a &quot;devil&quot; and a &quot;racist&quot; who did not support his African-American artists, using them merely for his own personal gain.611&quot;/&gt; He charged that Mottola had called his colleague Irv Gotti a &quot;fat nigger&quot;.150 Sony disputed claims that they had failed to promote Invincible with sufficient energy, maintaining that Jackson refused to tour in the US.151
Six years after his last studio album and after spending much of the late 1990s to early millennium out of the public eye, Jackson released Invincible in October 2001 to much anticipation. To help promote the album, a special 30th Anniversary celebration at Madison Square Garden occurred in September 2001 to mark the singer's thirtieth year as a solo artist. Jackson appeared onstage alongside his brothers for the first time since 1984.152 The show also featured performances by M&lt;U+00FD&gt;a, Usher, Whitney Houston, 'N Sync, and Slash, among other artists.153 At around the same time, in the wake of the September 11, 2001 attacks, Jackson helped organize the United We Stand: What More Can I Give benefit concert at RFK Stadium in Washington D.C. The concert was aired on October 21, 2001, and included performances from dozens of major artists, including Jackson, who performed his song &quot;What More Can I Give&quot; as the finale.617&quot;/&gt; Invincible was a commercial success, debuting atop the charts in 13 countries and going on to sell approximately 10 million copies worldwide. It received double-platinum certification in the US.154155156 However, the sales for Invincible were notably low compared to his previous releases, due in part to a diminishing pop music industry, the lack of promotion, no supporting world tour and the label dispute.617&quot;/&gt; The album spawned three singles, &quot;You Rock My World&quot;, &quot;Cry&quot; and &quot;Butterflies&quot;, the latter did not have a music video.
Reviews of Invincible were generally favorable, but there was a consensus that it was one of Jackson's least impressive records, mostly because it was too long. Allmusic gave the record three out of five stars saying, &quot;Ultimately, the record runs too long, losing steam halfway through...[It's] not enough to make Invincible the comeback Jackson needed...but it does offer a reminder that he can really craft good pop&quot;.157 NME gave the record six out of ten, stating, Invincible is a relevant and rejuvenated comeback album made overlong&quot;.158 Rolling Stone gave Invincible three out of five stars, believing that the early R&amp;B tracks were good, but the later ballads made the record too long.159 Reviewer Robert Christgau gave the album an A-, saying, &quot;His skills seem undiminished...his funk is steelier and his ballads are airier, both to disquieting effect. At 78 minutes this is too long.&quot;160 This was the same grade he gave Jackson's landmark album Thriller when originally released.161 Jackson and his supporters maintain that reviews were unfair, often discussing the singer's perceived eccentric image and past troubles, or making him the subject of ridicule.617&quot;/&gt; NME called him &quot;Michael 'Actually Quite Scary Now' Jackson&quot;, a &quot;Fucking freak&quot; and &quot;a bit of a wanker&quot;.162 Allmusic brought up &quot;[Jackson's] truly ugly public scandal, and swirling rumors about his diminishing finances&quot;.163 Rolling Stone believed that &quot;every song is full of grandiose desperation. It's an excruciatingly self-referential place, worsened further by its namesake's unmatched controversies and weirdnesses.&quot;164 Robert Christgau believed Jackson had a &quot;grotesque life magnified by his grotesque wealth&quot;. He was also of the opinion that Jackson singing about helping children was &quot;offensive&quot;.165
Jackson's third child, Prince Michael Jackson II (also known as Blanket) was born in 2002.166 The mother's identity has not been released by Jackson, but he has said the child was the result of artificial insemination from a surrogate mother and his own sperm cells.167 In November of that year, Jackson brought his new born son onto the balcony of his hotel room. Holding him in his right arm, with a cloth loosely draped over the baby's face, Jackson briefly extended the baby over the railing of the balcony, causing widespread criticism.168
2003&lt;U+2013&gt;2007: Documentary, trial and business ventures
 In 2003, Sony put out a compilation of Jackson's number-one hits on CD and DVD, titled Number Ones, which sold over six million copies worldwide.169 In the US it peaked at number 13 and was certified platinum by the RIAA.170 At the same time, Jackson was charged with seven counts of child molestation and two counts of administering an intoxicating agent in order to commit that felony; all charges regarded the same boy, Gavin Arvizo, who was under 14 at the time of the alleged crime. Earlier that year, a Granada Television documentary featuring Jackson showed him holding hands and discussing sleeping arrangements with Arvizo, who would later accuse him of child sexual abuse.171 In the same documentary Jackson was observed spending large amounts of money in an apparently frivolous manner, when he spent six million in a single store.172
Jackson denied the sexual abuse allegations, saying that the sleepovers were in no way sexual in nature. Jackson's friend Elizabeth Taylor defended him on Larry King Live, saying that she had been there when they &quot;were in the bed, watching television. There was nothing abnormal about it. There was no touchy-feely going on. We laughed like children and we watched a lot of Walt Disney. There was nothing odd about it.&quot;173 During the investigation, Jackson's profile were examined by a mental health professional called Dr. Stan Katz; the doctor spent several hours with the accuser too. The assessment made by Katz, was that Jackson had become a regressed 10-year-old and did not fit the profile of a pedophile.174
Following his upcoming trial, Jackson became dependent on morphine and Demerol, which he subsequently overcame.175 The People v. Jackson trial began in Santa Maria, California, two years after Jackson was originally charged. The trial lasted five months, until the end of May 2005. During the trial, the singer again suffered from stress-related illnesses and severe weight loss, that would alter his appearance.176 In June, Jackson was acquitted on all counts.177 Following the trial, Jackson relocated to the Persian Gulf island of Bahrain.178 Sony BMG released Visionary: The Video Singles to the European market: a series of 20 of his biggest hit singles of the 1980s and 1990s. Each single was issued weekly over a five-month period in Dual Disc format (DVD video on one side, CD audio on the other), and the whole group of discs was made available as a boxed set afterwards.179 The box set was released in the US on November 14, 2006.180
Reports of financial problems for Jackson became frequent in 2006 after the closure of the main house on the Neverland Ranch as a cost-cutting measure.181 One prominent financial issue for him concerned a $270 million loan secured against his music publishing holdings. After delayed repayments on the loan, a refinancing package shifted the loans from Bank of America to debt specialists Fortress Investments. A new package proposed by Sony would have had Jackson borrow an additional $300 million and reduce the interest rate payable on the loan, while giving Sony the future option to buy half of Jackson's stake in their jointly owned publishing company (leaving Jackson with a 25% stake).182 Jackson agreed to a Sony-backed refinancing deal, although details were not made public.183
Jackson's first documented public appearance since his trial was in November 2006, when he visited the London office of the Guinness World Records. He received eight records, among them &quot;First Entertainer to Earn More Than 100 Million Dollars in a Year&quot; and &quot;First Entertainer to Sell More Than 100 Million Albums Outside the United States&quot;.184 Jackson was awarded the Diamond Award on November 15, 2006, for selling over 100 million albums, at the World Music Awards.185 Following the death of James Brown, Jackson returned to the US to pay his respects. He, along with more than 8,000 people, paid tribute during Brown's public funeral on December 30, 2006.186187 In late 2006, Jackson agreed to share joint custody of his first two children with his second ex-wife.188 Jackson and Sony bought Famous Music LLC from Viacom in 2007. This deal gave him the rights to songs by Eminem, Shakira and Beck, among others.189

2008&lt;U+2013&gt;present: Thriller 25 and King of Pop
 Jackson issued the double-disc album Thriller 25, a 25th anniversary edition of Thriller. The set contained the original nine tracks from Thriller, re-mixes and a new song called &quot;For All Time&quot;. Two singles were released to moderate success: &quot;The Girl Is Mine 2008&quot; and &quot;Wanna Be Startin' Somethin' 2008&quot;. Thriller 25 was a commercial success, having done particularly well as a re-issue, peaking at number one in eight countries and Europe. It reached number two in the US, number three in the UK and top 10 on over 30 national charts.190191192 In the US, Thriller 25 was just 14,000 copies short of reaching the peak position, selling 166,000 copies. It was ineligible for the Billboard 200 chart as a re-release, but entered atop the Pop Catalog chart, where it stayed for 10 non-consecutive weeks and had the best sales on that chart since December 1996.193194195196 In 12 weeks, the album had sold 556,000 copies in the US and 3 million copies worldwide.197198
To celebrate Jackson's 50th birthday, Sony BMG will release a double disc compilation album called King of Pop in various countries. It will include 30 tracks from Jackson's group and solo career, all voted for by fans. Sony will then add rare tracks, previously unreleased material and a &quot;MegaMix&quot; by Jason Nevins. The album will be available in two versions and each country will have a different tracklist, according to how the fans of that nation voted.199200
Fortress considered a foreclosure sale of Neverland Ranch to service his loan, but ultimately sold the debt to Colony Capital LLC in May of that year.201
Musical style
Themes and genres
Steve Huey of Allmusic asserts that throughout his solo career, Jackson's versatility has allowed him to experiment with various themes and genres.202 As a musician, he has ranged from Motown's dance fare and ballads to techno-edged new jack swing to work that incorporates both funk rhythms and hard rock guitar.203 Unlike many artists, Jackson did not write his songs on paper. Instead he would dictate into a sound recorder; when recording he would sing from memory.210&quot;/&gt;204 Several critics observed Off the Wall was crafted from funk, disco-pop, soul, soft rock, jazz and pop ballads.205206207 Prominent examples include the ballad &quot;She's out of My Life&quot;, and the two disco tunes &quot;Workin' Day and Night&quot; and &quot;Get on the Floor&quot;.208
According to Huey, Thriller refined the strengths of Off the Wall; the dance and rock tracks were more aggressive, while the pop tunes and ballads were softer and more soulful.209 Notable tracks included the ballads &quot;The Lady in My Life&quot;, &quot;Human Nature&quot; and &quot;The Girl Is Mine&quot;; the funk pieces &quot;Billie Jean&quot; and &quot;Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'&quot;; and the disco set &quot;Baby Be Mine&quot; and &quot;P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)&quot;.210211212213 With Thriller, Christoper Connelly of Rolling Stone commented that Jackson developed his long association with the subliminal theme of paranoia and darker imagery.214 Allmusic's Stephen Erlewine noted this is evident on the songs &quot;Billie Jean&quot; and &quot;Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'&quot;.215 In &quot;Billie Jean&quot;, Jackson sings about an obsessive fan who alleges he has fathered a child of hers.216 In &quot;Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'&quot; he argues against gossip and the media.217 The anti-gang-violence rock song &quot;Beat It&quot; became a homage to West Side Story, and was Jackson's first successful rock cross-over piece, according to Huey.218219 He also observed that the title track &quot;Thriller&quot; began Jackson's interest with the theme of the supernatural, a topic he revisited in subsequent years.220 In 1985, Jackson wrote the charity anthem &quot;We Are the World&quot;; humanitarian themes later became a central component of his life and music.221    s signature pieces, released as a single in 1988. Jackson uses digital drum sounds, key board created bass lines and other percussion elements to gives the impression of a pulsing heart.222 }}   In Bad, Jackson's concept of the predatory lover can be seen on the rock song &quot;Dirty Diana&quot;.223 The lead single &quot;I Just Can't Stop Loving You&quot; was a traditional love ballad, while &quot;Man in the Mirror&quot;, an anthemic ballad of confession and resolution, improved on his earlier &quot;We Are the World&quot;.224 &quot;Smooth Criminal&quot; was an evocation of bloody assault, rape and likely murder.225 Allmusic's Stephen Erlewine states that Dangerous presents Jackson as a stark paradoxal individual.226 He comments the album is more diverse than his previous Bad, as it appeals to an urban audience while also attracting the middle class with anthems like &quot;Heal the World&quot;.227 The first half of the record is dedicated to new jack swing, including songs like &quot;Jam&quot; and &quot;Remember the Time&quot;.228 The album is Jackson's first where social ills become a primary theme; &quot;Why You Wanna Trip on Me&quot;, for example, protests against world hunger, AIDS, homelessness and drugs.229 Dangerous contains sexually charged efforts like &quot;In the Closet&quot;, a love song about desire and denial, risk and repression, solitude and connection, privacy and revelation.230 The title track continues the theme of the predatory lover and compulsive desire.231 The second half includes introspective, pop-gospel anthems such as &quot;Will You Be There&quot;, &quot;Heal the World&quot; and &quot;Keep the Faith&quot;; these songs show Jackson finally opening up about various personal struggles and worries.232 In the ballad &quot;Gone Too Soon&quot;, Jackson gives tribute to his friend Ryan White and the plight of those with AIDS.233 The album also contained one of his first power ballads, &quot;Give in to Me&quot;.234
HIStory creates an atmosphere of paranoia.235 Its content focuses on the hardships and public struggles Jackson went through just prior to its production. In the new jack swing-funk-rock efforts &quot;Scream&quot; and &quot;Tabloid Junkie&quot;, along with the R&amp;B ballad &quot;You Are Not Alone&quot;, Jackson retaliates against the injustice and isolation he feels, and directs much of his anger at the media.236 In the introspective ballad &quot;Stranger in Moscow&quot;, Jackson laments over his &quot;fall from grace&quot;, while songs like &quot;Earth Song&quot;, &quot;Childhood&quot;, &quot;Little Susie&quot; and &quot;Smile&quot; are all operatic pop pieces.237238 In the track &quot;D.S.&quot;, Jackson launched a verbal attack against Tom Sneddon. He describes Sneddon as an antisocial, white supremacist who wanted to &quot;get my ass, dead or alive&quot;. Of the song, Sneddon said, &quot;I have not&lt;U+2014&gt;shall we say&lt;U+2014&gt;done him the honor of listening to it, but I&lt;U+2019&gt;ve been told that it ends with the sound of a gunshot&quot;.239 Invincible found Jackson working heavily with production Rodney Jerkins.240 It is a record made up of urban soul like &quot;Cry&quot; and &quot;The Lost Children&quot;, ballads such as &quot;Speechless&quot;, &quot;Break of Dawn&quot; and &quot;Butterflies&quot;241242 and mixes hip hop, pop and rap in &quot;2000 Watts&quot;, &quot;Heartbreaker&quot; and &quot;Invincible&quot;.243
Vocal style





Jackson has been singing since a child, and over time his voice and vocal style have notably changed, either through puberty or a personal preference to align his vocal interpretation to the themes and genres he chooses to express. Between 1971 and 1975, Jackson's voice &quot;descended ever so slightly from boy soprano to his current androgynous high tenor&quot;.244 In the mid-1970s, the singer adopted a &quot;vocal hiccup&quot; as seen in &quot;Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground)&quot;. The purpose of the hiccup&lt;U+2014&gt;somewhat like a gulping for air or gasping&lt;U+2014&gt;is to help promote a certain emotion; be it excitement, sadness or fear.245 With the arrival of Off the Wall in the late 1970s, Jackson's abilities as a vocalist were well regarded; Allmusic described him as a &quot;blindingly gifted vocalist&quot;.246 At the time, Rolling Stone compared his vocals to the &quot;breathless, dreamy stutter&quot; of Stevie Wonder. They also reached the analysis that, &quot;Jackson's feathery-timbered tenor is extraordinary beautiful. It slides smoothly into a startling falsetto that's used very daringly&quot;.247 1982 saw the released of Thriller, Rolling Stone were of the opinion that Jackson was then singing in a &quot;fully adult voice&quot; that was &quot;tinged by sadness&quot;.248
The release of &quot;Bad&quot; in 1987 displayed gritty lead vocals on the verse and lighter tones employed on the chorus.249 The turn of the 1990s saw the release of the paradoxical, introspective album Dangerous, here Jackson used his vocals to intensify the split themes and genres described earlier. The New York Times noted that on some tracks, &quot;he gulps for breath, his voice quivers with anxiety or drops to a desperate whisper, hissing through clenched teeth&quot; and he had a &quot;wretched tone&quot;.250 When singing of brotherhood or self-esteem the musician would return to &quot;smooth&quot; vocals.251 &quot;In the Closet&quot; contained heavy breathing and a loop of five scat-sung syllables, whereas in the albums title track, Jackson performs a spoken rap.252253 When commenting on Invincible, Rolling Stone were of the opinion that&lt;U+2014&gt;at the age of 43&lt;U+2014&gt;Jackson still performed, &quot;exquisitely voiced rhythm tracks and vibrating vocal harmonies&quot;.254 Nelson George summed by Jackson's vocals as, &quot;The grace, the aggression, the growling, the natural boyishness, the falsetto, the smoothness&lt;U+2014&gt;that combination of elements mark him as a major vocalist&quot;.255
Music videos
 Steve Huey of Allmusic observes the fact that Jackson transformed the music video into an art form and a promotional tool through complex story lines, dance routines, special effects and famous cameo appearances; simultaneously breaking down racial barriers.256 Before the success of the Thriller album, Jackson struggled to receive coverage on MTV because he was African American.257 Pressure from CBS Records persuaded MTV to start showing &quot;Billie Jean&quot; and later &quot;Beat It&quot;, leading to a lengthy partnership with Jackson that helped other black music artists gain recognition.258 The popularity of his video on MTV helped to put the relatively young channel &quot;on the map&quot;; MTV's focus shifted in favor of pop and R&amp;B.259260 Short films like Thriller largely remained unique to Jackson, while the group dance sequence in &quot;Beat It&quot; has frequently been imitated.261 The choreography in Thriller has become a part of global pop culture, replicated everywhere from Bollywood to prisons in the Philippines.262263 The Thriller short film marked an increase in scale for music videos, and has been named the most successful music video ever by the Guinness World Records.264
In the 18-minute music video for &quot;Bad&quot;&lt;U+2014&gt;directed by Martin Scorsese&lt;U+2014&gt;Jackson began using sexual imagery and choreography not previously seen in his work. He occasionally grabbed or touched his chest, torso and crotch. While he has described this as &quot;choreography,&quot; it garnered a mixed reception from both fans and critics; Time magazine described it as &quot;infamous&quot;. The video also featured Wesley Snipes; Jackson's videos would often feature famous cameos roles in the future.373&quot;/&gt;265 For &quot;Smooth Criminal&quot;, Jackson experimented with an innovative &quot;anti-gravity lean&quot; in his performances, for which he was granted US Patent No. 5,255,452.266 Although the music video for &quot;Leave Me Alone&quot; was not officially released in the US, in 1989, it was nominated for four Billboard Music Video Awards, winning three; the same year it won a Golden Lion Award for the quality of the special effects used in its production. In 1990, &quot;Leave Me Alone&quot; won a Grammy for Best Music Video, Short Form.267
The MTV Video Vanguard Artist of the Decade Award was given to Jackson to celebrate his accomplishments in the art form in the 1980s; the following year the award was renamed in his honor.268 &quot;Black or White&quot; was accompanied by a controversial music video, which, on November 14, 1991, simultaneously premiered in 27 countries with an estimated audience of 500 million people, the largest viewing ever for a music video.269 It featured scenes construed as having a sexual nature as well as depictions of violence. The offending scenes in the final half of the 14-minute version were edited out to prevent the video from being banned, and Jackson apologized.270 Along with Jackson, it featured Macaulay Culkin, Peggy Lipton and George Wendt. It helped usher in morphing as an important technology in music videos.271 &quot;Remember the Time&quot; was an elaborate production, and became one of his longest videos at over nine minutes. Set in ancient Egypt, it featured groundbreaking visual effects and appearances by Eddie Murphy, Iman and Magic Johnson, along with a distinct complex dance routine.272 The video for &quot;In the Closet&quot; was Jackson's most sexually provocative piece to date. It featured supermodel Naomi Campbell in a courtship dance with Jackson. The video was banned in South Africa because of its imagery.273  The music video for &quot;Scream&quot;, directed by Mark Romanek and production designer Tom Foden, is one of Jackson's most critically acclaimed. In 1995, it gained 11 MTV Video Music Award Nominations&lt;U+2014&gt;more than any other music video&lt;U+2014&gt;and won &quot;Best Dance Video&quot;, &quot;Best Choreography&quot;, and &quot;Best Art Direction&quot;.274 The song and its accompanying video are a response to the backlash Jackson received from the media after being accused of child molestation in 1993.275 Foden commented &quot;Mark had written the treatment and the general idea was that Michael and Janet were on this large spacecraft. And they, were alone ... They were getting away from Earth, and the different sets were the different environments on the spacecraft where they could have a little bit of fun and where they could relax&quot;.276 Production of the music video's 13-piece set was restricted to a one-month period and was produced by Foden art directors Richard Berg, Jeff Hall, and Martin Mervel.277 Foden described the assignment as a &quot;military operation&quot; as he explained &quot;[t]he idea was to give each of the art directors three sets: a complicated one, a not-so-complicated one, and one of the smaller, easier vignettes.&quot;278 A year later, it won a Grammy for Best Music Video, Short Form; shortly afterward Guinness World Records listed it as the most expensive music video ever made at a cost of $7 million.50&quot;/&gt;279 &quot;Earth Song&quot; was accompanied by an expensive and well-received music video that gained a Grammy nomination for Best Music Video, Short Form in 1997. The video had an environmental theme, showing images of animal cruelty, deforestation, pollution and war. Using special effects, time is reversed so that life returns, war ends and the forests re-grow.50&quot;/&gt;280 Released in 1997 and premiering at the 1996 Cannes Film Festival, Ghosts was a short film written by Jackson and Stephen King and directed by Stan Winston. The video for Ghosts is over 38 minutes long and holds the Guinness World Record as the world's longest music video.611&quot;/&gt;28128250&quot;/&gt;
Legacy and influence

 Jackson's successful career has made him a part of pop culture for almost four decades.283 Inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1984, Jackson has had a notable impact on music and culture throughout the world. He broke down racial barriers, transformed the art of the music video and paved the way for modern pop music in his own country. Jackson's work, distinctive musical sound and vocal style have influenced numerous hip hop, pop and R&amp;B artists, including Mariah Carey,284 Usher,285 Britney Spears,286 Justin Timberlake,617&quot;/&gt; R.
