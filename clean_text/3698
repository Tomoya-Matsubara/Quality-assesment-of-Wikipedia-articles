New York City is a global economic center, with its business, finance, trading, law, and media organizations influential worldwide.1 The city is also an important cultural center, with many museums, galleries, and performance venues. Home of the United Nations, the city is a hub for international diplomacy. The current mayor is Michael Bloomberg, who assumed office after Rudolph W. Giuliani on January 1, 2002.
New York City comprises five boroughs, each of which are coterminous with a county: The Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens, and Staten Island. With over 8.2 million residents within an area of 322 square miles (830Â km&lt;U+00B2&gt;), New York City has the highest population density of any major North American city.23 The New York metropolitan area, with a population of 18.8 million, ranks among the largest urban areas in the world.4
The city has many neighborhoods and landmarks known around the world. The Statue of Liberty greeted millions of immigrants as they came to America in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Wall Street, in Lower Manhattan, has been a dominant global financial center since World War II and is home to the New York Stock Exchange. The city has been home to several of the tallest buildings in the world, including the Empire State Building and the former twin towers of the World Trade Center. The city is the birthplace of many American cultural movements, including the Harlem Renaissance in literature and visual art, abstract expressionism in painting, and hip hop5 along with the Tin Pan Alley in music. In 2005, nearly 170 languages were spoken in the city and 36 percent of its population was foreign born.67
From its beginnings on Manhattan Island, the city spread onto nearby Staten Island, western Long Island, and mainland North America. The mainland and many islands of New York are linked by a network of bridges and tunnels, including the Brooklyn Bridge and Holland Tunnel. The New York City Subway, with 660 miles of track, serves an average of 4.9 million passengers per day.8 Two airports are located in New York City, and the surrounding Tri-State Region offers many other cultural, economic, and transportation options. To manage its tremendous infrastructure, the city has one of the most devolved governments in the country, including the ability to collect income tax.
The city was founded as the colony of New Amsterdam by Dutch colonists in the early 17th century, being ceded as part of the Province of New York to the English in 1664. The five boroughs were consolidated into one city in 1898. It has been central to the development of the United States, serving as the nation's first capital city in 1789, and has had a large influence in American media, finance, and politics. It is the site of some of the country's greatest celebrations, including ticker-tape parades for returning astronauts and the celebrations in Times Square of the end of World War II, but has also seen tragic times, such as the September 11, 2001 attacks.
History

At the time of its European discovery in 1524 by Giovanni da Verrazzano, the region was inhabited by the Lenape Native Americans.9 But it was not until the voyage of Henry Hudson, an Englishman hired by the Dutch East India Company to find a route to China, that the area was mapped.10 He discovered Manhattan Island on September 11, 1609, and continued up the river that bears his name, the Hudson River, until he arrived at the site where New York State's capital city, Albany, now stands. His aim to find a route to China had failed but what he had discovered was something even better, the largest natural harbor in the New World on the island of Manhattan and the third largest in the entire world.
Realizing the immense potential of this harbor, the Dutch settlement began with the founding of a fur trading settlement, later called &quot;New Amsterdam,&quot; (Dutch- &quot;Nieuw Amsterdam&quot;) on the southern tip of Manhattan in 1614. The initial settlers were not Dutch at all but Belgian and French Huguenots escaping religious persecution in Europe. Dutch colonial Director-General Peter Minuit purchased the island of Manhattan from the Canarsie Native Americans in 1626.1112 In 1664, the British conquered the city, and there by uniting their colonies in Massachusetts and Virginia and renamed the city, &quot;New York&quot; after the English Duke of York, the heir to the throne.  New York City grew in importance as a trading port while under British rule. In 1754, Columbia University was founded under charter by King George II as King's College in Lower Manhattan. During the American Revolutionary War, the city emerged as the theater for a series of major battles known as the New York Campaign which raged from 1776 through 1777. The Congress of the Confederation met in New York City from 1785 to 1789, and the city officially became the capital on September 13, 1788. The first President of the United States, George Washington, was inaugurated at Federal Hall on Wall Street in April 1789.13 New York City remained the capital until 1790, when the Federal government relocated to Philadelphia.
New York City quickly became the nation's dominant trading center when the Erie Canal was completed in 1825, connecting the Atlantic port to the vast agricultural markets of the North American interior.14 The Commissioners' Plan of 1811, which created a rational street grid to encompass most of Manhattan, helped guide expansion of the city.15 By 1835, New York City had surpassed Philadelphia as the largest city in the United States, with immigration playing an important role in growth. The Irish Potato Famine brought a large influx of Irish immigrants, and by 1850, the Irish comprised one quarter of the city's population.16 Government institutions, including the New York City Police Department and the public schools, were established in the 1840s and 1850s to respond to growing demands of residents.17 Public-minded members of the old merchant aristocracy pressed for Central Park, which became the first landscaped park in an American city in 1857. Local politics fell under the domination of Tammany Hall, a political machine supported by Irish immigrants.  Anger at military conscription during the American Civil War (1861&lt;U+2013&gt;1865) led to the Draft Riots of 1863, one of the worst incidents of civil unrest in American history. Eleven black men were lynched over a five day period, and hundreds of blacks forced out of the city.18 In 1898 the modern City of New York was formed with the consolidation of Brooklyn (until then an independent city), Manhattan and municipalities in the other boroughs. The opening of the New York City Subway in 1904 helped bind the new city together. Throughout the first half of the 20th century, the city became a world center for industry, commerce, and communication. In 1911 the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire, the city's worst industrial disaster, took the lives of 146 garment workers and spurred the growth of the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union and major improvements in factory safety standards.19  In the 1920s, New York City was a major destination for African Americans during the Great Migration from the American South. By 1916, New York City was home to the largest urban African diaspora in North America. The Harlem Renaissance flourished during the era of Prohibition, and coincident with a larger economic boom that saw the construction of a skyline filled with competing skyscrapers. New York City became the most populous city in the world in 1925, overtaking London, which had reigned for a century. The difficult years of the Great Depression saw the election of reformer Fiorello LaGuardia and the fall of Tammany Hall after eighty years of political dominance.20
Returning World War II veterans and immigrants from Europe created a postwar economic boom and the development of huge housing tracts in eastern Queens. Ironically, the city's prosperity would lead many middle class residents to the new suburban developments in Long Island such as Levittown, aided by the bridges and thoroughfairs constructed under Robert Moses.21 New York emerged from the war unscathed and the leading city of the world, with Wall Street leading America's rise as the world's dominant economic power. In 1952, the United Nations established its headquarters in New York City. The rise of Abstract Expressionism in the city made New York an important center of the art world.22
Like many large American cities, New York suffered a decline in manufacturing and rising crime rates, race riots, and white flight in the 1960s. By the 1970s, the city had gained a reputation as a crime-ridden relic of history. In the 1980s, a resurgence in the financial industry improved the city's fiscal health. By the 1990s, racial tensions had calmed, crime rates dropped dramatically, and waves of new immigrants arrived from Asia and Latin America. Important new sectors, such as Silicon Alley, emerged in the city's economy and New York's population reached an all-time high in the 2000 census. The city was one of the sites of the September 11, 2001 attacks, when nearly 3,000 people died in the destruction of the World Trade Center. The Freedom Tower will be built on the site and is scheduled for completion in 2010.23
Geography

 New York City is located in the Northeastern United States, in southeastern New York state, approximately halfway between Washington, D.C. and Boston.24 The location at the mouth of the Hudson River, which feeds into a naturally sheltered harbor, has helped the city grow in significance as a trading city. Much of New York is built on the three islands of Manhattan, Staten Island, and western Long Island, making land scarce and encouraging a high population density.
The Hudson River flows from the Hudson Valley into New York Bay, becoming a tidal estuary that separates the city from New Jersey. The East River, actually a tidal strait, flows from Long Island Sound and separates the Bronx and Manhattan from Long Island. The Harlem River, another tidal strait between the East and Hudson Rivers, separates Manhattan from the Bronx.
The city's land has been altered considerably by human intervention, with substantial land reclamation along the waterfronts since Dutch colonial times. Reclamation is most notable in Lower Manhattan, with developments such as Battery Park City in the 1970s and 1980s.25 Much of the natural variations in topography have been evened out, particularly in Manhattan.26
The city's land area is 321Â mi&lt;U+00B2&gt; (831.4Â km&lt;U+00B2&gt;).27 The highest point in the city is Todt Hill on Staten Island, which at 409.8Â ft (124.9Â m) above sea level is the highest point on the Eastern Seaboard south of Maine.28 The summit of the ridge is largely covered in woodlands as part of the Staten Island Greenbelt.29
Climate
 Although located at about the same latitude as the much warmer European cities of Naples and Madrid, New York has a humid continental climate (K&lt;U+00F6&gt;ppen classification Dfa) resulting from prevailing wind patterns that bring cool air from the interior of the North American continent.30 The city's coastal position keeps temperatures relatively warmer than inland regions during winter, helping to moderate the amount of snow which averages 25 to 35Â inches (63.5 to 88.9Â cm) each year.31 New York City has a frost-free period lasting an average of 220 days between seasonal freezes.32 Spring and Fall in New York City are mild, while summer is very warm and humid, with temperatures of 90&lt;U+00B0&gt;F (32&lt;U+00B0&gt;C) or higher recorded from 18 to 25 days on average during the season.33 The city's longterm climate patterns are affected by the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, a 70-year-long warming and cooling cycle in the Atlantic that influences the frequency and severity of hurricanes and coastal storms in the region.34 
Environment

 Environmental concerns in the city involve managing its extraordinary population density. Mass transit use is the highest in the nation and gasoline consumption in the city is at the rate the national average was in the 1920s.35 New York City's dense population and low automobile dependence help make New York among the most energy efficient in the United States.36 The city's greenhouse gas emission levels are relatively low when measured per capita, at 7.1 metric tons per person, below San Francisco, at 11.2 metric tons, and the national average, at 24.5.37 New Yorkers are collectively responsible for one percent of the nation's total greenhouse gas emissions,38 though comprise 2.7% of the nation's population. The average New Yorker consumes less than half the electricity used by a resident of San Francisco and nearly one-quarter the electricity consumed by a resident of Dallas.39
Large amounts of concentrated pollution in New York City lead to high incidence of asthma and other respiratory conditions among the city's residents.40 In recent years the city has focused on reducing its environmental impact. The city government is required to purchase only the most energy-efficient equipment for use in city offices and public housing.41 New York has the largest clean air diesel-hybrid and compressed natural gas bus fleet in the country, and some of the first hybrid taxis.42 The city is also a leader in energy-efficient green office buildings, home to the Hearst Tower and numerous others.43
The city is supplied with water by the Pepacton, Ashokan, and other reservoirs in the Catskill Mountains watershed.44 As a result of the watershed's integrity and undisturbed natural water filtration process, city drinking water does not require purification by water treatment plants.4546
Cityscape
Architecture

 The building form most closely associated with New York City is the skyscraper, a pioneering urban form that saw city building shift from the low-scale European tradition to the vertical rise of business districts. Surrounded mostly by water, New York's residential density and high real estate values in commercial districts saw the city amass the largest collection of individual, free-standing office and residential towers in the world.47
New York has architecturally significant buildings in a wide range of styles. These include the Woolworth Building (1913), an early gothic revival skyscraper built with massively scaled gothic detailing able to be read from street level several hundred feet below. The 1916 Zoning Resolution required setback in new buildings, and restricted towers to a percentage of the lot size, to allow sunlight to reach the streets below.48 The Art Deco design of the Chrysler Building (1930), with its tapered top and steel spire, reflected the zoning requirements. The building is considered by many historians and architects to be New York's finest building, with its distinctive ornamentation such as replicas at the corners of the 61st floor of the 1928 Chrysler eagle hood ornaments and V-shaped lighting inserts capped by a steel spire at the tower's crown.49 A highly influential example of the international style in the United States is the Seagram Building (1957), distinctive for its facade using visible bronze-toned I-beams to evoke the building's structure. The Cond&lt;U+00E9&gt; Nast Building (2000) is an important example of green design in American skyscrapers.50
The character of New York's large residential districts is often defined by the elegant brownstone rowhouses, townhouses, and tenements that were built during a period of rapid expansion from 1870 to 1930.51 Stone and brick became the city's building materials of choice after the construction of wood-frame houses was limited in the aftermath of the Great Fire of 1835.5253 Unlike Paris, which for centuries was built from its own limestone bedrock, New York has always drawn its building stone from a far-flung network of quarries and its stone buildings have a variety of textures and hues.54 A distinctive feature of many of the city's buildings is the presence of wooden roof-mounted water towers. In the 1800s, the city required their installation on buildings higher than six stories to prevent the need for excessively high water pressures at lower elevations, which could burst municipal water pipes.55 Garden apartments became popular during the 1920s in outlying areas, including Jackson Heights in Queens, which became more accessible with expansion of the subway.56
Boroughs

 New York City is comprised of five boroughs, an unusual form of government used to administer the five constituent counties that make up the city.57 Throughout the boroughs there are hundreds of distinct neighborhoods, many with a definable history and character to call their own. If the boroughs were each independent cities, four of the boroughs (Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, and the Bronx) would be among the ten most populous cities in the United States.

The Bronx (pop. 1,364,566)58 is New York City's northernmost borough. The site of Yankee Stadium, home of the New York Yankees, and home to the largest cooperatively owned housing complex in the United States, Co-op City.59 Except for a small piece of Manhattan known as Marble Hill, the Bronx is the only section of the city that is part of the United States mainland. It is home to the Bronx Zoo, the largest metropolitan zoo in the United States, which spans 265Â acres (107.2Â hectares) and is home to over 6,000 animals.60 The Bronx is the birthplace of rap and hip hop culture.61


Brooklyn (pop. 2,511,408)62 is the city's most populous borough and was an independent city until 1898. Brooklyn is known for its cultural and ethnic diversity, an independent art scene, distinct neighborhoods and a unique architectural heritage. The borough also features a long beachfront and Coney Island, established in the 1870s as one of the earliest amusement grounds in the country.63


Manhattan (pop. 1,593,200)64 is the most densely populated borough and home to most of the city's skyscrapers. The borough contains the major business and financial centers of the city and many cultural attractions, including Madison Square Garden. Manhattan is loosely divided into Downtown, Midtown, and Uptown regions. Midtown and Uptown Manhattan are also divided by Central Park into east and west sides.


Queens (pop. 2,256,576)65 is geographically the largest borough and the most ethnically diverse county in the United States.66 Historically a collection of small towns and villages founded by the Dutch, the borough today is mainly residential and middle class. It is the only large county in the United States where the median income among black households, about $52,000 a year, has surpassed that of whites.67 Queens is the site of Shea Stadium, the home of the New York Mets, and annually hosts the U.S. Open Grand Slam tennis tournament.


Staten Island (pop. 475,014)68 is the most suburban in character of the five boroughs. It is connected to Brooklyn by the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge and to Manhattan via the free Staten Island Ferry. Until 2001, the borough was home to the Fresh Kills Landfill, formerly the largest landfill in the world, which is now being reconstructed as a large urban park.69

Culture

 &quot;Culture just seems to be in the air, like part of the weather,&quot; the writer Tom Wolfe said as he praised New York City.70 Numerous major American cultural movements began in the city, such as the Harlem Renaissance, which established the African-American literary canon in the United States. The city was the epicenter of jazz in the 1940s, abstract expressionism in the 1950s, and the birthplace of hip hop in the 1970s. Also, Manhatta (1920), the nation's first avante-garde film, was filmed in New York City.71 The city's punk rock scene was influential in the 1970s and 1980s, and the city has long had a flourishing scene for Jewish American literature. Prominent indie rock bands coming out of New York in recent years include The Strokes, The Mooney Suzuki and Interpol.  The city has more than 2,000 arts and cultural organizations and more than 500 art galleries of all sizes.72 The city government funds the arts with a larger annual budget than the National Endowment for the Arts.73 Wealthy industrialists in the 19th century built a network of major cultural institutions, such as the famed Carnegie Hall and Metropolitan Museum of Art, that would become internationally established. The advent of electric lighting led to elaborate theatre productions, and in the 1880s New York City theaters on Broadway and along 42nd Street began showcasing a new stage form that came to be known as the Broadway musical. Strongly influenced by the city's immigrants, these productions used song in narratives that often reflected themes of hope and ambition. Today these productions are a mainstay of the New York theatre scene. The city's 39 largest theatres (with more than 500 seats) are collectively known as &quot;Broadway,&quot; after the major thoroughfare that crosses the Times Square theatre district.74
The Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, which includes Jazz at Lincoln Center, the Metropolitan Opera, the New York City Opera, the New York Philharmonic and the New York City Ballet, is the largest performing arts center in the United States. Summerstage presents performances of free plays and music in Central Park and 1,200 free concerts, dance, and theater events across all five boroughs in the summer months.75
Tourism

 About 40 million foreign and American tourists visit New York City each year.76 Major destinations include the Empire State Building, Ellis Island, Broadway theatre productions, museums such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and other tourist attractions including Central Park, Washington Square Park, Rockefeller Center, Times Square, the Bronx Zoo, New York Botanical Garden, luxury shopping along Fifth and Madison Avenues, and events such as the Halloween Parade in Greenwich Village, the Tribeca Film Festival, and free performances in Central Park at Summerstage. Many of the city's ethnic enclaves, such as Jackson Heights, Flushing, and Brighton Beach are major shopping destinations for first and second generation Americans up and down the East Coast. Although not owned by The City of New York, the Statue of Liberty is a major tourist attraction for those visiting the city and is one of the most recognizable icons of the United States.77
New York City has over 28,000 acres (113Â km&lt;U+00B2&gt;) of parkland and 14 miles (22Â km) of public beaches.7879 Manhattan's Central Park, designed by Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux, is the most visited city park in the United States.80 Prospect Park in Brooklyn, also designed by Olmsted and Vaux, has a 90 acre (36Â Hectare) meadow.81 Flushing Meadows Park in Queens, the city's third largest, was the setting for the 1939 World's Fair and 1964 World's Fair.
New York's food culture, influenced by the city's immigrants and large number of dining patrons, is diverse. Jewish and Italian immigrants made the city famous for bagels, cheesecake and New York style pizza. Some 4,000 mobile food vendors licensed by the city, many immigrant-owned, have made Middle Eastern foods such as falafels and kebabs standbys of contemporary New York street food.82 The city is also home to many of the finest haute cuisine restaurants in the United States.83
Sports

 New York City has teams in each of the major American professional sports leagues. Baseball is the city's most closely followed sport. There have been fourteen World Series championship series between New York City teams, in matchups called Subway Series. The city's two current Major League Baseball teams are the New York Yankees(south Bronx) and the New York Mets(Flushing Queens), who enjoy a fierce rivalry. There are also two minor league baseball teams in the city, the Staten Island Yankees and Brooklyn Cyclones.
The city is represented in the National Football League by the New York Jets and New York Giants, although both teams play their home games in Giants Stadium in nearby New Jersey. The New York Rangers and New York Islanders represent the city in the National Hockey League. Both the National Hockey League and the National Football League are headquartered in Manhattan.
New York City has a rich basketball history as well. The first national college-level basketball championship, the National Invitation Tournament, was held in New York in 1938 and remains in the city.84 Rucker Park in Harlem is a celebrated court where many professional athletes play in the summer league. The city's National Basketball Association team is the New York Knicks. 
As a global city, New York supports many events outside the big four American sports. These include the U.S. Tennis Open, the New York City Marathon and the Millrose Games, an annual track and field meet whose featured event is the Wanamaker Mile. Boxing is also a very prominent part of the cities sporting scene, with events like the Amateur Boxing Golden Gloves being held at Madison Square Gardens each year.
Many sports are associated with New York's immigrant communities. Stickball, a street version of baseball, was popularized by youths in working class Puerto Rican, Italian, and Irish neighborhoods in the 1930s. In recent years several amateur cricket leagues have emerged with the arrival of immigrants from South Asia and the Caribbean.85
Media

 New York is a global center for the television, advertising, music, newspaper and book publishing industries and is also the largest media market in the United States.86 Some of the city's media conglomerates include Time Warner, the News Corporation, the Hearst Corporation, and Viacom. Seven of the world's top eight global advertising agency networks are headquartered in New York.87 Three of the &quot;Big Four&quot; record labels are also based in the city. One-third of all American independent films are produced in New York.88 More than 200 newspapers and 350 consumer magazines have an office in the city89 and book-publishing industry employs about 25,000 people.90
Two of the three national daily newspapers in the United States are New York papers, The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times. Major tabloid newspapers in the city include The New York Daily News and The New York Post, founded in 1801 by Alexander Hamilton. The city also has a major ethnic press, with 270 newspapers and magazines published in more than 40 languages.91 El Diario La Prensa is New York's largest Spanish-language daily and the oldest in the nation.92 The New York Amsterdam News, published in Harlem, is a prominent African-American newspaper.
The television industry developed in New York and is a significant employer in the city's economy. The four major American broadcast networks, ABC, CBS, FOX and NBC, are all headquartered in New York. Many cable channels are based in the city as well, including MTV, Fox News, HBO and Comedy Central. In 2005 there were more than 100 television shows taped in New York City.93
New York is also a major center for non-commercial media. Public access television originated in the city in 1968. WNET is the city's major public television station and a primary provider of national PBS programming. WNYC, a public radio station owned by the city until 1997, has the largest public radio audience in the United States.94 The City of New York operates a public broadcast service, NYCTV, that produces several original Emmy Award-winning shows covering music and culture in city neighborhoods, as well as city government.
Economy

 New York City is a global hub of international business and commerce and is one of three &quot;command centers&quot; for the world economy (along with London and Tokyo).95 The city is a major center for finance, insurance, real estate, media and the arts in the United States. The New York metropolitan area had an estimated gross metropolitan product of $952.6 billion in 2005, the largest regional economy in the United States.96 The city's economy accounts for the majority of the economic activity in the states of New York and New Jersey.97 Many major corporations are headquartered in New York City, including 44 Fortune 500 companies.98 New York is also unique among American cities for its large number of foreign corporations. One out of ten private sector jobs in the city is with a foreign company.99
The New York Stock Exchange, located on Wall Street, and the NASDAQ are the world's first and second largest stock exchanges, respectively, when measured by average daily trading volume and overall market capitalization.100 Financial services account for more than 35 percent of the city's employment income.101 Real estate is a major force in the city's economy, as the total value of all New York City property was $802.4 billion in 2006.102 The Time Warner Center is the property with the highest-listed market value in the city, at $1.1 billion in 2006.103
The city's television and film industry is the second largest in the country after Hollywood.104 Creative industries such as new media, advertising, fashion, design and architecture account for a growing share of employment, with New York City possessing a strong competitive advantage in these industries.105 High-tech industries like bioscience, software development, game design, and Internet services are also growing due to its position at the terminus of the transatlantic fiber optic trunk line in New York City.106 Other important sectors include medical research and technology, non-profit institutions, and universities.
Manufacturing accounts for a large but declining share of employment. Garments, chemicals, metal products, processed foods, and furniture are some of the principal products.107 The food-processing industry is the most stable major manufacturing sector in the city.108 Food making is a $5 billion industry that employs more than 19,000 residents, many of them immigrants who speak little English. Chocolate is New York City's leading specialty-food export, with $234 million worth of exports each year.109

New York is the most populous city in the United States, as the estimated 2005 population of New York City is 8,213,839 (up from 7.3 million in 1990).110 This amounts to about 40% of New York State's population and a similar percentage of the metropolitan regional population. Over the last decade the city has been growing rapidly and demographers estimate New York's population will reach between 9.2 and 9.5 million by 2030.111
New York's two key demographic features are its density and diversity. The city has an extremely high population density of 26,403 people per square mile (10,194/km&lt;U+00B2&gt;), about 10,000 more people per square mile than the next densest American city, San Francisco.112 Manhattan's population density is 66,940 people per square mile (25,846/km&lt;U+00B2&gt;), largest of any county in the United States.113114

New York City is exceptionally diverse. Throughout its history the city has been a major point of entry for immigrants; the term &quot;melting pot&quot; was first coined to describe densely populated immigrant neighborhoods on the Lower East Side. 36% of the city's population is foreign-born.115 Among American cities, this proportion is higher only in Los Angeles and Miami.116 While the immigrant communities in those cities are dominated by a few nationalities, in New York no single country or region of origin dominates. The ten largest countries of origin for modern day immigration are the Dominican Republic, China, Jamaica, Guyana, Mexico, Ecuador, Haiti, Trinidad and Tobago, Colombia and Russia. The largest ethnic groups in New York City are African American, Italian, Jewish, and Irish. 117 About 170 languages are spoken in the city.118
The New York City metropolitan area is home to the largest Jewish community outside Israel; Tel Aviv proper (non-metro/within municipal limits) has smaller population than the Jewish population of New York City proper, making New York the largest Jewish community in the world.119 It is also home to nearly a quarter of the nation's South Asians,120 and the largest African American community of any city in the country. There is also a substantial Puerto Rican and Dominican population. Another historically significant ethnic group are Italians, who emigrated to the city in large numbers in the early twentieth century. The Irish also have a notable presence; one in 50 New Yorkers of European origin carry a distinctive genetic signature on their Y chromosomes inherited from Niall of the Nine Hostages, an Irish high king of the fifth century A.D.121
New York City has a high degree of income disparity. In 2005 the median household income in the wealthiest census tract was $188,697, while in the poorest it was $9,320.122 The disparity is driven by wage growth in high income brackets, while wages have stagnated for middle and lower income brackets. In 2006 the average weekly wage in Manhattan was $1,453, the highest and fastest growing among the largest counties in the United States.123 The borough is also experiencing a baby boom that is unique among American cities. Since 2000, the number of children under age 5 living in Manhattan grew by more than 32%.124
Government

 Since its consolidation in 1898, New York City has been a metropolitan municipality with a &quot;strong&quot; mayor-council form of government. The government of New York is more centralized than that of most other U.S. cities. In New York City, the central government is responsible for public education, correctional institutions, libraries, public safety, recreational facilities, sanitation, water supply and welfare services. The mayor and councillors are elected to four-year terms. The New York City Council is a unicameral body consisting of 51 Council members whose districts are defined by geographic population boundaries.125 The mayor and councilors are limited to two four-year terms.
The mayor is Michael Bloomberg, a former Democrat elected as a Republican in 2001 and re-elected in 2005 with 59% of the vote.126 He is known for taking control of the city's education system from the state, rezoning and economic development, sound fiscal management, and aggressive public health policy. In his second term he has made school reform, poverty reduction, and strict gun control central priorities of his administration.127 The Democratic Party holds the majority of public offices. 66% of registered voters in the city are Democrats.128 Party platforms center on affordable housing, education and economic development, and labor politics are of importance in the city.  New York is the most important source of political fundraising in the United States, as four of the top five zip codes in the nation for political contributions are in Manhattan. The top zip code, 10021 on the Upper East Side, generated the most money for the 2004 presidential campaigns of both George W. Bush and John Kerry.129 The city has a strong imbalance of payments with the national and state governments. New York City receives 83 cents in services for every $1 it sends to the federal government in taxes (or annually sends $11.4 billion more than it receives back). The city also sends an additional $11 billion more each year to the state of New York than it receives back.130
As the host of the United Nations, New York City is home to the world's largest international consular corps, comprising 122 consulates, consulates general and honorary consulate offices.131
Crime

Organized crime has long been associated with New York City, beginning with the Forty Thieves and the Roach Guards in the Five Points in the 1820s, notorious mobsters Arnold Rothstein, Meyer Lansky, and Lucky Luciano in the 20th century, gangs including the Black Spades, and more recently the Bloods and Crips who arrived from Los Angeles.132 Numerous major riots have occurred in New York City since the mid-1800s, including the Draft Riots in 1863, multiple riots at Tompkins Square Park, and in Harlem.133 The serial killings by the &quot;Son of Sam&quot;, which began on July 29, 1976, terrorized the city for the next year.134
Crime rates spiked in the 1980s and early 1990s, as the crack epidemic hit New York City. During the 1990s, the New York City Police Department adopted CompStat, broken windows policing, and other strategies in effort to reduce crime. These efforts, along with other factors such as changing demographics, helped reduce crime drastically during the later part of the 1990s and into the 2000s.135136 Since 1991, the city has seen a continuous fifteen-year trend of decreasing crime. Neighborhoods that were once considered dangerous are now much safer. Violent crime in the city has dropped by 75% in the last twelve years and the murder rate in 2005 was at its lowest level since 1963: there were 539 murders that year, for a murder rate of 6.58 per 100,000 people, compared to 2262 murders in 1990.137 As of 2005, New York City has the lowest crime rate among the ten largest cities in the United States.138
Education

 The city's public school system, managed by the New York City Department of Education, is the largest in the United States. About 1.1 million students are taught in more than 1,200 separate primary and secondary schools.139 There are approximately 900 additional privately run secular and religious schools in the city, including some of the most prestigious private schools in the United States.140
Though it is not often thought of as a &quot;College Town&quot;, there are about 594,000 university students in New York City, the highest number of any city in the United States.141 In 2005, three out of five Manhattan residents were college graduates and one out of four had advanced degrees, forming one of the highest concentrations of highly educated people in any American city.142 Public postsecondary education is provided by the City University of New York, the nation's third-largest public university system, and the Fashion Institute of Technology, part of the State University of New York. New York City is also home to such notable private universities as Columbia University, Cooper Union, Fordham University, Manhattan College, The New School, New York Institute of Technology, New York University, Pace University, Polytechnic University, and St. John's University. The city has dozens of other private colleges and universities, including many religious and special-purpose institutions, such as The Juilliard School.
Much of the scientific research in the city is done in medicine and the life sciences. New York City has the most post-graduate life sciences degrees awarded annually in the United States, 40,000 licensed physicians, and 127 Nobel laureates with roots in local institutions.143 The city receives the second-highest amount of annual funding from the National Institutes of Health among all U.S. cities.144 Major biomedical research institutions include Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, Rockefeller University, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Mount Sinai School of Medicine and Weill Cornell Medical College.
The New York Public Library, which has the largest collection of any public library system in the country, serves Manhattan, The Bronx, and Staten Island.145 Queens is served by the Queens Borough Public Library, which is the nation's second largest public library system, and Brooklyn Public Library serves Brooklyn.146 The New York Public Library has several research libraries, including the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture.
Transportation

 Public transit is overwhelmingly the dominant form of travel for New Yorkers.147 About one in every three users of mass transit in the United States and two-thirds of the nation's rail riders live in New York and its suburbs.148149 This is in contrast to the rest of the country, where about 90% of commuters drive automobiles to their workplace.150 New York is the only city in the United States where more than half of all households do not own a car (in Manhattan, more than 75% of residents do not own a car; nationally, the percentage is 8%).151
The New York City Subway is one of the largest rapid transit systems in the world when measured by track, with 660Â miles (1,062Â km ) of mainline track, and the fourth-largest when measured by annual ridership (1.4 billion passenger trips in 2005).152 The transportation system in New York City is extensive and complex. It includes the longest suspension bridge in North America,153 the world's first mechanically ventilated vehicular tunnel,154 more than 12,000 yellow cabs155 and an aerial tramway that transports commuters between Roosevelt Island and Manhattan.  New York City's public bus fleet and commuter rail network are the largest in North America.156 The rail network, which connects the suburbs in the tri-state region to the city, has more than 250 stations and 20 rail lines.157158159 The commuter rail system converges at the two busiest rail stations in the United States, Grand Central Terminal and Penn Station.160161
New York City is the top international air passenger gateway to the United States.162 The area is served by three major airports, Kennedy (also known as JFK), Newark and LaGuardia. 100 million travelers used the three airports in 2005 and the city's airspace is the busiest in the nation.163 Outbound international travel from JFK and Newark accounted for about a quarter of all U.S. travelers who went overseas in 2004.164
New York's high rate of public transit use, 120,000 daily cyclists165 and many pedestrian commuters makes it one of the most energy-efficient cities in the United States.166 It is well positioned to endure an oil crisis with an extended gasoline price shock in the range of US$3 to US$8 per gallon.167 Walk and bicycle modes of travel account for 21% of all modes for trips in the city; nationally the rate for metro regions is about 8%.168
