Wimbledon Football Club was an English professional football club from Wimbledon, south-west London. Founded in 1889, the club spent most of its history in amateur and semi-professional non-League football prior to a &quot;fairytale&quot; rise through the divisions following election to The Football League in 1977. This success resulted in the club looking to move from its home ground, Plough Lane, and seeking an alternative base.
Relocation to Milton Keynes, a new town  to the north of Wimbledon, was originally considered in the late 1970s, soon after the club's election to the Football League, but not followed up. Various abortive local options were explored during the 1980s, but the 1991 Taylor Report, which recommended all-seater stadia for all top-flight clubs, led the team to temporarily groundshare with Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park whilst an alternative was sought.
Milton Keynes, because of its foundation and designation as a new town in 1967, represented a unique situation in English football in that there was no professional team representing it that had secured the loyalty of local supporters. Wimbledon were not the only team to be approached regarding a move there – a move by Charlton was briefly mooted in 1973 and the subject was regularly broached with Luton Town, most notably in 1982. In the early 2000s, the Milton Keynes Stadium Consortium, led by Pete Winkelman, proposed a Football League-standard stadium in Milton Keynes, partly funded by an attached retail development. The opportunity to take up this new ground was offered to Luton, Wimbledon, Barnet, Crystal Palace and Queens Park Rangers. Despite an initial negative response from Wimbledon, the appointment in 2000 by its owners of a new chairman, Charles Koppel, led to more receptive talks.
The Wimbledon board announced its intention to move the club to Milton Keynes in August 2001; received permission in May 2002; and did so in September 2003. Soon after the relocation's confirmation in May 2002, supporters opposed to the move formed a new team, AFC Wimbledon. The relocated club renamed itself Milton Keynes Dons in June 2004 and after a period of time playing at the National Hockey Stadium, moved to a new 22,000 seat stadium in the town playing their first game at the new ground in July 2007.
Background to the relocation
The new town of Milton Keynes

Following the end of the Second World War in 1945, the population of London increased significantly, causing the construction of a number of new towns across the south-east of England. Overspill housing for several London boroughs was constructed in Bletchley, in north Buckinghamshire, by London County Council.123 With this not proving to be enough, a Ministry of Housing and Local Government (MoH&amp;LG) study proposed &quot;a new city&quot; near Bletchley in 1964.4 Bletchley, which had been considered for designation in its own right, became instead only a part of the planned development: A further MoH&amp;LG study in 1965 recommended that the existing towns of Stony Stratford and Wolverton should also be included.56 A target population of 250,000 was given for what was to be the biggest new town of all, built on an area previously home to about 40,000.7 &quot;Milton Keynes&quot;, named after the village of Milton Keynes already present on the site and purposely placed equidistant from London, Birmingham, Leicester, Oxford and Cambridge,8 was designated as a new town on 23 January 1967.910
All of the football clubs present within the boundaries of the new town were playing outside The Football League. The largest of these teams were United Counties League sides Bletchley Town and Wolverton Town &amp; B.R.,11121314 South Midlands League outfit Stony Stratford Town and local teams New Bradwell St Peter and Newport Pagnell Wanderers,15 who would join the South Midlands League in 1970 and 1972 respectively.1617
Previous Milton Keynes relocation proposals

In English football, the relocation of teams away from their traditional districts is extremely unusual because of nature of the relationship between clubs and their local fans: the local football club is regarded by most English football supporters as part of the local identity and social fabric rather than as a business that can be transplanted by its owners at will. As a result, any relocation plan would be strongly opposed by fans in the club's original area, and unlikely to succeed in most new locations due to the existence of established local clubs in most towns and cities that would already have secured the loyalty of local supporters. However, due to its recent establishment in 1967, Milton Keynes provided an exception to this rule; most people living there had been born and raised elsewhere,18 and no team representing Milton Keynes or any of its constituent towns had yet risen high enough in the football pyramid to secure their loyalty.19
Charlton Athletic
 The first Football League team to be linked with a move to the new town was Charlton Athletic, in 1973. The club was in financial difficulties and had just been relegated to the third tier at the end of the 1971–72 campaign.2021 Towards the end of the 1972–73 season, Charlton revealed plans for commercial extensions to their ground, The Valley: a community sports complex and a public market to be held on weekdays.22 Greenwich Council refused to licence the market and insisted that the complex be built on public space at a local park,23 leading the club to announce that it could potentially relocate and that there was &quot;an approach from a progressive Midlands borough&quot;.2425 The club then stated that it was &quot;in no way disenchanted with the district or with the fans&quot; and that there was &quot;no possibility&quot; of the club leaving the ground unless it was &quot;forced out by the attitude of Greenwich Council&quot;.26 Charlton encouraged supporters to &quot;[protest] as loud as you can to Greenwich Council&quot; in order to &quot;make sure the club continues in Charlton&quot;.27 Fans &quot;flooded the club and the local papers&quot; with opinion against any move, and although the club was indeed approached by Milton Keynes authorities, no relocation occurred.28

Wimbledon
Because of Wimbledon's &quot;fairytale&quot;29 rise from obscurity through the English football pyramid, the team quickly &quot;outgrew&quot;30 their Plough Lane ground after their election to The Football League in 1977.31 Ron Noades, club chairman at the time, claimed in 2003 to have &quot;[seen] the limitations in Plough Lane&quot; as early as 1979, and to have also cited the side's location as the reason for the club's continuing low gates at that time.32
Noades's interest was attracted by the site designated by the local Milton Keynes authority for a stadium next to the town's still-under-construction Central railway station.33 Intending to merge Wimbledon with a local Milton Keynes club in order to take up the site, Noades bought non-League club Milton Keynes City for &lt;U+00A3&gt;1,34 capitalising on the smaller club's financial problems.35 After Noades and three other Wimbledon directors &lt;U+2013&gt; Jimmy Rose, Bernie Coleman and Sam Hammam &lt;U+2013&gt; were voted onto MK City's board &quot;in an advisory capacity&quot;, Noades emphasised that it was a move by the four directors &quot;for long term investment&quot; and not Wimbledon itself; however, he also claimed that whereas there was &quot;no future for us [Wimbledon] at Plough Lane&quot;, &quot;Milton Keynes ha[d] long term potential&quot; and was able to &quot;support a multi-purpose stadium&quot;.36 No move (for Wimbledon) occurred and MK City was sold on; Noades later claimed that he had &quot;really [been unable to] see any future in it&quot; and that there was no &quot;means of drawing large attendances to Milton Keynes&quot;.3738 Noades, who had paid &lt;U+00A3&gt;2,782 for then non-League Wimbledon in 1976,39 charged Hammam a figure between &lt;U+00A3&gt;40,000 and &lt;U+00A3&gt;100,000 for the club in 1981 before becoming chairman of nearby Crystal Palace during the same year.4041
Luton Town
 Luton Town, based in Milton Keynes's neighbouring town of Luton, were also seeking a new site at this time. As early as 1960, then-First Division Luton's attendances were deemed &quot;far too low to support a top-flight team&quot; by Charles Buchan&lt;U+2019&gt;s Football Monthly, which also considered their ground at Kenilworth Road to be hard to get to.42 Luton already planned to build &quot;a new 50,000-capacity stadium situated to the north-west of the town, near Dunstable&quot;,43 but no new ground materialised, and when Luton were promoted back to the top league at the end of the 1981&lt;U+2013&gt;82 season, the club was still based at Kenilworth Road. The prospect of moving to Milton Keynes &quot;tempted&quot; Luton's owners; &quot;the local paper dreamed of &quot;MK Hatters&quot; playing in a &quot;super-stadium&quot;&quot;.44 The distance from Milton Keynes to Luton is far shorter than that to Wimbledon –  compared to  – but &quot;vehement&quot; resistance from Luton fans prevented the club from moving at this time.4546

Wimbledon leave Plough Lane
After reaching the First Division for the 1986&lt;U+2013&gt;87 season,47 Wimbledon's success as a club in the top-flight of English football was founded on unorthodox financial management and judicious dealings in the transfer market.48 The team was granted planning permission to build a 20,000-capacity all-seater ground in its home borough of Merton in 1988,49 but the site was instead made into a car park by a newly-elected Labour council in 1990.50 Wimbledon's desire to move was made a necessity a year later, when the Taylor Report, which ordered the extensive redevelopment of football grounds, was released.51 When Hammam had purchased the club from Ron Noades, Wimbledon had also owned its ground at Plough Lane,52 though a pre-emption clause had existed specifying that the ground was only to be used for &quot;sports, leisure or recreational purposes&quot;53 &lt;U+2013&gt; if Wimbledon Football Club were ever to cease to exist, then Merton Council would be able to buy Plough Lane back for &lt;U+00A3&gt;8,000.54 This clause reduced the possibility of the club losing its home stadium, but it was unpopular with a succession of Wimbledon owners: Noades stated that there was &quot;no future for [Wimbledon] at Plough Lane&quot; unless the clause were &quot;sorted out&quot;,55 and Hammam argued that it incurred upon his ability to borrow money needed to redevelop the ground.56 Seeking to increase the value of Plough Lane, Hammam entered into negotiations with the council for its removal in 1990; the eventual agreed price for the revoking of the clause was a sum between &lt;U+00A3&gt;300,000 and &lt;U+00A3&gt;800,000.57 The deal had not been unanimously popular among the owners of Wimbledon &lt;U+2013&gt; at least one club director had resigned his position in protest.58 Despite the decision to remove the clause, the club could not afford to redevelop Plough Lane when required to do so the following year.59
 As a result, Wimbledon moved across south London before the start of the 1991&lt;U+2013&gt;92 season to share the Selhurst Park ground belonging to Noades's Crystal Palace.60 This decision was unpopular among Wimbledon fans, and the club's &quot;already modest&quot; support resultantly took a hit the club could ill-afford.61 Concurrently with this move, the council's recommended proposal of a relocation to a ground in nearby Beddington fell through.62 With the inflation in costs brought on by the foundation of the FA Premier League in 1992, the club soon began to lose money heavily;63 Hammam attempted to find a new home for the club, and citing what he claimed was &quot;a lack of support&quot; from the local council, sought to relocate within south London to &quot;seven boroughs around us [Wimbledon]&quot;,64 including Tolworth and Brixton &lt;U+2013&gt; insisting, meanwhile, that in the event of such a move the club would be &quot;totally renamed in protest at the lack of council support&quot;.65 Hammam claimed in 2000 to have &quot;looked at every possible site in our borough&quot;,66 but according to the BBC, he turned down the opportunity to redevelop Wimbledon Stadium in 1992.67 Two years after this, Merton Council, attempting to retain the Plough Lane site for public use, refused to sanction Hammam's proposed sale of the ground for a supermarket redevelopment. Hammam reacted with a &quot;vow never to return to the ground&quot;.68
Hammam gradually withdraws
While remaining at the club in an advisory role, Hammam sold the club to two Norwegian businessmen, Kjell Inge R&lt;U+00F8&gt;kke and Bj&lt;U+00F8&gt;rn Rune Gjelsten, in 1997,69 and, with political control of Merton Council having changed, he secured the &lt;U+00A3&gt;8 million sale of the Plough Lane site to Safeway supermarkets in 1998.70 Hammam unsuccessfully attempted to gain permission to redevelop a former gas works in Merton during the same year,71 and soon after once again launched abortive negotiations over a site in Beddington.72 Following this, Hammam started to look further and further afield,73 and despite the anger from a majority of supporters,74 considered Basingstoke, &quot;Gatwick&quot; (near Crawley), Dublin, Belfast, Cardiff and (non-specifically) &quot;Scotland&quot; as potential new locations for the club,75767778 even receiving Premier League approval for Dublin &lt;U+2013&gt; described by Hammam as &quot;an excellent way out of our problems and into cloud nine&quot;79 &lt;U+2013&gt; before the idea was vetoed by the Football Association of Ireland.80 During this time, Wimbledon were also approached by seven other clubs, all from outside of London, each offering to share their home ground.81 After the FAI veto of the move to Dublin, Hammam offered to buy Selhurst Park from Noades, still the owner of the ground despite his sale of Crystal Palace in 1998;82 Hammam offered &lt;U+00A3&gt;12 million in 1999, but this plan came to nothing.83 Hammam subsequently sold his shares in Wimbledon in February 2000,84 and became the owner of Cardiff City in September of that year.85
Milton Keynes proposed again
 The club was approached by the Milton Keynes Stadium Consortium, led by Pete Winkelman and supported by Asda (a subsidiary of Wal-Mart) and IKEA,86 in late 2000.87 This consortium proposed a large development in Milton Keynes, including a 30,000-capacity football stadium,8889 an Asda hypermarket,90 an IKEA store, a hotel,91 a conference centre and a retail park.929394 The decision to build such a ground was complicated by the fact that the highest ranked team in the town, Milton Keynes City,95 was playing in the then eighth-tier Spartan South Midlands League, four divisions below The Football League.96 The developers could not justify building a stadium of such a size for a club of this small stature,97 though the system of promotion and relegation used in English football means that consistent good performance can result in a side rising through the leagues over time &lt;U+2013&gt; indeed, as Wimbledon did themselves during the 1970s and 1980s.98 However, the Milton Keynes Stadium Consortium resolved instead to &quot;import&quot; an established Football League club to use the ground.99 Wimbledon fans opposed to the move claimed that the stadium was a &quot;Trojan Horse&quot; only included in the blueprint to bypass planning rules,100 and that although the consortium described the Asda superstore as an &quot;enabling development to finance the building of the stadium&quot;, the opposite was in fact the case;101 they claimed that this was why it was so necessary for the consortium to import a team: without a professional club, the ground would not be built, and without the ground, the development could not go ahead.102 The local Milton Keynes authorities favoured the plan: council leader Norman Miles stated that &quot;[the town] would welcome a major football club&quot;, but also implied that the identity of any relocated club was irrelevant, saying that &quot;[i]t could be Southend or Blackpool I suppose&quot;.103 The consortium had already attempted to relocate Luton Town to Milton Keynes earlier that year,104105 but had been blocked by a Football League decree that &quot;all clubs must stay in their own area&quot;.106 After this, the consortium tried to negotiate moves with north London club Barnet and Wimbledon's landlords Crystal Palace respectively, but failed to persuade either to take up the proposal.107108








The consortium's offer was initially turned down by Wimbledon,109 but Charles Koppel, the new chairman appointed by the Norwegian owners in January 2001,110 was in favour of the move.111 Koppel claimed that the club's owners were subsidising it to the tune of &quot;around &lt;U+00A3&gt;6 million a year&quot; and that &quot;if the club d[id] not move [it] w[ould] die&quot;.112 The Milton Keynes consortium, meanwhile, had turned its attention to west London club Queens Park Rangers. Just as the consortium had always maintained that the Wimbledon name, colours and badge would remain even after any potential relocation,113 QPR were promised that the club name and blue-and-white hooped strip would be kept if the team moved.114 QPR were also offered &quot;supporter representation on the [club's] board&quot;.115 Despite being in financial administration, QPR turned down the offer made by the consortium at the end of the 2000&lt;U+2013&gt;01 season,116 leading the consortium to once again contact Wimbledon in June 2001 with a &quot;firmed up&quot; proposal.117 With Koppel now in charge, the club was more receptive to the idea.118 As talks progressed, Winkelman began to register various internet domain names relating to &quot;MK Dons&quot;,119 and approached the owner of Milton Keynes City, attempting to buy the club name.120 Although fans were &quot;angrily opposed to the plans&quot;,121 Koppel announced in August 2001 that the club intended to relocate to the new town;122 the club made a formal application for the Football League&lt;U+2019&gt;s approval at the same time.123 Meanwhile, the local council claimed that Noades had agreed to sell the Selhurst Park ground to Wimbledon &lt;U+2013&gt; something which Noades denied.124
The proposed move to Milton Keynes was opposed in most quarters: a majority of Wimbledon fans &quot;fiercely opposed&quot; it, as well as both The Football Association and The Football League.125126127 Although relocation of a Football League club across such a distance was unprecedented, similar moves had occurred within the Scottish Football League during the 1990s: Glasgow club Clyde and Edinburgh-based Meadowbank Thistle had migrated to the new towns of Cumbernauld and Livingston respectively, with Meadowbank actually adopting the name of the town on moving (they dropped the suffix &quot;Thistle&quot;).128129 The Football League told the consortium that any Milton Keynes club would have to earn membership by &quot;progress[ing] through the pyramid&quot; and unanimously rejected Wimbledon's application to move.130131 However, when the decision was contested by the club, an arbitration panel was formed, made up of Association vice-chairman David Dein (also vice-chairman of Arsenal), York City chairman Douglas Craig and Charles Hollander QC.132133134 Before the arbitration panel heard Wimbledon's appeal in January 2002, Winkelman claimed that even if the move was turned down, &quot;[the] door w[ould] be open to any club in trouble [to attempt to relocate to Milton Keynes]&quot;;135 however, the panel unanimously decided that the decision taken had &quot;not been properly taken in the legal sense, and that the procedures had not been fair&quot;,136 meaning that the possibility of Wimbledon relocating remained open.137 As a result of this verdict, the League board reconvened on 17 April 2002 to reconsider the proposal, and concluded that the matter should be considered by an independent commission appointed by The Football Association.138 The commission members chosen by the FA were solicitor Raj Parker, FA Council member Alan Turvey (also Chairman of the Isthmian League) and Steve Stride, the Operations Director at Aston Villa.139 The commission ruled in favour of the move, by two votes to one, on 28 May 2002.140141
Foundation of AFC Wimbledon and relocation of Wimbledon F.C.



From this point Wimbledon F.C. is named in full in order to disambiguate from AFC Wimbledon.


The FA made it clear that although the decision was final and binding, it strongly opposed the relocation.142 The Association's Chief Executive, Adam Crozier, publicly stated that it was an &quot;appalling decision&quot;,143 while the Association itself revealed that it had submitted to the commission its opposition to the move.144 Many Wimbledon F.C. fans were &quot;left devastated by the decision&quot;,145 and, calling it the &quot;death of [their] club&quot;,146 founded their own team, AFC Wimbledon, weeks after the move's approval.147 The new club entered a groundsharing arrangement with Kingstonian, moving into the latter club's home ground of Kingsmeadow in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames, adjacent to the original side's home borough of Merton.148 Meanwhile, Wimbledon F.C. became pejoratively nicknamed by some as &quot;Franchise F.C.&quot; (FFC).149 AFC Wimbledon claimed that since forming, their average attendance was 3,700 and that the gates of Wimbledon F.C. had been affected as a result.150 This situation meant that during the 2002–03 season, Wimbledon F.C.'s last full term at Selhurst Park, attendances at Wimbledon F.C. matches fell below those at Kingsmeadow possibly due to the fact that a number of local fans were now following AFC Wimbledon instead.151152 Wimbledon F.C.'s resultant lower income contributed to the club entering administration in June 2003.153154 A month later, the largest football team in Milton Keynes, Milton Keynes City, went out of business due to a lack of investment.155156
Weeks before Wimbledon F.C.'s entry into administration, Luton Town had been purchased by a consortium of &quot;businessmen&quot; from Hong Kong and the United States.157 The &quot;public face&quot; of the consortium was John Gurney, a man who in 1999 had been arrested and remanded on a charge of &quot;conspiracy to import cocaine&quot;, charges he was subsequently cleared of.158 Gurney had floated the idea of buying Wimbledon F.C. and merging the club with Luton Town &quot;effectively buying a back door to Division One&quot;. Gurney said that he would approach the Wimbledon F.C. administrators to find out the terms as &quot;it does no harm to ask the question&quot;.159 Further ideas from Gurney included the building of a &quot;70,000-capacity stadium&quot; near Junction 10 on the M1 and the possible renaming of the club to London Luton after the airport&quot;.160 Neither idea however was followed up. After six weeks of Gurney ownership described by supporters' representative Yvonne Fletcher as &quot;a complete nightmare, kind of Kafkaesque&quot;,161 Luton entered administrative receivership themselves &quot;as a protective measure&quot;, resulting in Gurney's departure and the abandoning of his plans.162163
After starting the 2003–04 season at Selhurst Park, the first Wimbledon F.C. match in Milton Keynes was played on 27 September 2003 – a 2–2 draw with Burnley at the National Hockey Stadium, temporarily converted for football use pending construction of the new stadium.164165 The club struggled both on and off the pitch throughout the season, spending its entirety in administration and eventually finishing bottom of the second-tier First Division.166167168 An article appeared in British journal Property Week in May 2004, after Wimbledon F.C. had been relegated,169170 stating that the construction of the new stadium would be cancelled were Wimbledon F.C. to go out of business;171 in response, Richard Foreman, a director of the consortium's development consultant, stated that &quot;the scheme w[ould] go ahead&quot;172 with &quot;the total support of the council&quot;173 were this to happen.174 On the subject of who would occupy the new stadium, Foreman added that the consortium would &quot;have a year and a half to find another club [to relocate to Milton Keynes]&quot;.175 Winkelman's consortium brought the club out of administration in June 2004,176 and although it had originally stated that the name &quot;Wimbledon F.C.&quot; would remain in place regardless of the move,177 changed the club's name, badge and colours soon after.178
Aftermath



Identity
The new name of the club was &quot;Milton Keynes Dons Football Club&quot;,179 a name made up of the team's new location and a common nickname of Wimbledon-based sports teams, &quot;The Dons&quot;. Winkelman's consortium claimed that the name was intended to &quot;represent the past, present and future and place the club at the heart of its new community&quot;180 as well as to &quot;retain a link with its former identity&quot;.181 The blue and yellow colours that Wimbledon F.C. players had worn were replaced by an all-white strip,182 while the club badge became an rendering of the letters &quot;MK&quot;, the &quot;K&quot; positioned below the &quot;M&quot;, rotated 90&lt;U+00B0&gt; anti-clockwise and defaced with the year &quot;MMIV&quot; (2004).183 AFC Wimbledon, meanwhile, founded in 2002 to attempt to continue the original club's identity,184185 adopted a home kit of blue and yellow,186 emulating the uniform worn by Wimbledon F.C.187 In a similar vein, the emblem chosen by AFC Wimbledon was, like the Wimbledon F.C. badge, based on the coat of arms of the Municipal Borough of Wimbledon,188 and the traditional local nickname, &quot;The Dons&quot;, was established as the club's nickname.189

The new stadium

After first playing at the National Hockey Stadium in September 2003,190 the club continued to use the ground following its June 2004 rebranding. Work on the &quot;Denbigh Stadium&quot; had not yet even begun; despite its original proposed opening time of the 2004&lt;U+2013&gt;05 season, ground was not broken on the intended 30,000-capacity stadium until February 2005.191 After the club set a new target of January 2007 in December 2005,192 February 2007 saw a revised proposal of a 22,000-seater ground ready in July of that year, with provision for expansion to 32,000.193 The first match at the ground, by now renamed &quot;Stadium:mk&quot; was played in July 2007.194
History and honours
 The location of the history and legacy of Wimbledon F.C., as well as the honours won by the club, remained open to debate for five years after the relocation's confirmation on 28 May 2002.195196 In the view of AFC Wimbledon and its supporters, &quot;[t]he identity of a football club is implicitly bound up in its community&quot;,197198 while on the other hand, Pete Winkelman claimed in November 2004 that &quot;we're the real child of Wimbledon&quot;.199 By now chairman of Milton Keynes Dons, Winkelman said during the same interview that &quot;both the MK Dons and AFC Wimbledon share the same heritage&quot;,200 but also that the founders of AFC Wimbledon had &quot;left their team before their team left them&quot;.201 Winkelman went on to say that he would retain the trophies and history of Wimbledon F.C. in Milton Keynes, because AFC Wimbledon had &quot;abdicated their right to it when they all walked away.&quot;202 Despite Winkelman's claims, the history and honours eventually found their way back to Merton in August 2007, a year after extensive negotiations had been completed between the Wimbledon Independent Supporters Association, Milton Keynes Dons F.C., the Milton Keynes Dons Supporters Association and the Football Supporters Federation.203 Milton Keynes Dons announced at the same time that they considered themselves to be a new club, formed in 2004, and renounced all claims to a club history before this point.204 As a result of these developments, the WISA revoked its call for supporters to boycott Milton Keynes Dons matches played in Milton Keynes and removed its objection to Milton Keynes Dons fans joining the Football Supporters Federation.205 The Wimbledon F.C. trophies and memorabilia were subsequently put on public display at Morden Library in Merton in April 2008.206
Players and staff
The Wimbledon Independent Supporters Association, by now affiliated to AFC Wimbledon, formed the Wimbledon Old Players Association (WOPA) in September 2005 &quot;as part of its campaign to reclaim the history of Wimbledon Football Club for AFC Wimbledon and/or the community of Wimbledon&quot;.207 Membership was opened to any former Wimbledon F.C. or AFC Wimbledon player or manager; there were sixty founder members.208 The AFC Wimbledon-backed WOPA team competed as Wimbledon in the London Masters tournament in July 2006.209
Footnotes



A.  The name &quot;Milton Keynes City&quot; refers to two different clubs: the former Bletchley Town F.C., which took the name in 1974 and used it until its liquidation in 1985; and Spartan South Midlands League side Mercedes-Benz F.C., which renamed itself in 1998 and retained the title until its own demise in 2003.210211212

B. Wolverton Town &amp; B.R. went through a variety of names after the founding of Milton Keynes in 1967, dropping &quot;B.R.&quot; in 1981 before adding &quot;(Milton Keynes)&quot; in 1987 to become Wolverton Town (Milton Keynes). A year later the naming order was reversed, with the club now becoming Milton Keynes Wolverton Town, or Milton Keynes Wolves. Finally, in 1990, the name Wolverton A.F.C. was adopted, which remained until the club's dissolution in 1992.213214215216

C. Newport Pagnell Wanderers became Newport Pagnell Town in 1972.217

D. These seven clubs were Watford, Luton Town, Birmingham City, West Bromwich Albion, Portsmouth, Brighton &amp; Hove Albion and Hull City.218

E. During the 2003&lt;U+2013&gt;04 season, Luton Town played in the third-tier Football League Second Division, one division below Wimbledon F.C..219
