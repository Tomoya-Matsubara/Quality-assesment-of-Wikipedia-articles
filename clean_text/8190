NFL career
Allen was drafted as the tenth overall pick on the first round of the 1982 NFL Draft by the Los Angeles Raiders. In his rookie season in 1982, he rushed for 697 yards as he led the Raiders to the best record in the AFC with a strike-shortened 8-1 record and was elected as NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year. The Raiders would lose to the New York Jets in the AFC Divisional Playoffs.
The next season, Marcus rushed for over 1,000 yards for the first time, he would do that again in 1984 and 1985. That season, he rushed for 1,759 yards and scored 11 touchdowns on 380 carries as he led the Raiders to a 12-4 record and the AFC West Title and was named the NFL MVP.

Allen is best remembered for his heroics in Super Bowl XVIII. He ran for 191 yards, caught 2 passes for 18 yards, and scored 2 touchdowns in the Raiders 38-9 victory over the Washington Redskins. This included a 74-yard touchdown run, a record that was the longest run in Super Bowl history, until Super Bowl XL when it was broken by Willie Parker, by a single yard.  After a stormy relationship with Al Davis including missing most of the 1989 season with a knee injury, he left Los Angeles to join the Kansas City Chiefs in 1993, that year he rushed for only 764 yards, but scored 12 touchdowns leading the AFC, as he and Joe Montana led the Chiefs to the AFC Championship Game and was named the NFL Comeback Player of the Year that season. Allen went on to play for the Chiefs for four more seasons, leading the team in rushing every year but his last. Allen's main contribution to the Chiefs was his leadership abilities.
