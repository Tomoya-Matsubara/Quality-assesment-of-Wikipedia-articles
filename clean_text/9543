History
The station was founded on September 30, 1962, as KCRL-TV. It aired an analog signal on VHF channel 4 and was the second television station in Northern Nevada. The call letters became KRNV on January 22, 1990. The station has always been an NBC affiliate, although it shared ABC with KOLO-TV until 1967. On March 25, 1997, KENV signed-on as a semi-satellite of KRNV, extending its signal into Northeastern Nevada; it remains the only full-powered television station in Elko. The station operated another satellite, KWNV channel 7, in Winnemucca, but this went silent on July 1, 2008. KENV started broadcasting digital-only on March 26, 2009, after its analog transmitter broke down and forced a switch to digital.
After the analog television shutdown and digital conversion on June 12, KRNV remained on its pre-transition channel number, 7. However, through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers continue to display its virtual channel as 4. The signal for KRNV was relayed on translators K52DN in Carson City and K56BW in Tahoe City, California. These were necessary because the analog transmitter for KRNV was on Red Peak in Reno and operated with limited power to protect KRON-TV in San Francisco. With the digital transmitter on Slide Mountain, the translators were no longer necessary and the licenses were canceled.
On December 19, 2006, KRNV began broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition, making it the first station in the market to do so12 (although local PBS station KNPB became the first in Northern Nevada to offer digital broadcasts, Sept. 2000).
News operation
KRNV produces the only midday newscast in the Reno area. Its weeknight 6 o'clock broadcast is the only one at the time. As a result, KRNV airs NBC Nightly News at 5:30. Other stations air national newscasts at 6. Public affairs show Ralston Reports airs weeknights at 6:30 on KRNV, KENV, and at 7:30 pm on KSNV-DT in Las Vegas. On April 2, 2012, KRNV became the first station to offer a 4:00 pm newscast in the market.3 Other newscasts include a two-hour long News 4 Today that runs from 5:00 am to 7:00 am, and News 4 at 11pm. KRNV's noon and 6 p.m. newscasts are simulcast in Ely on KVNV.4
KRNV became the second station in the country to do regularly scheduled Monday through Friday daily web-only newscasts powered by Google's G+ Hangouts on January 25, 2012.5 The webcast started at 11:00 am Pacific Time and incorporated people in a news-talk format from all around the world.67 An on-air show featuring Google+ at 11:00 am debuted September 24, 2012, under the name News 4 Forum. The first News 4 Forum featured Steve Grove, Head of Community Development at Google+.8 President Barack Obama did his second ever Google+ hangout on News 4 Forum late in the 2012 Presidential race.9
KRNV partners with Sam Shad Productions to air Nevada Newsmakers, a show similar to Meet the Press, Monday through Thursday at 12:30 immediately after the noon news.10 That company also produces The Dining Show which airs on Fridays at 12:30.11
On September 11, 2010, KRNV debuted public affairs show To The Point with Anjeanette Damon. Damon's first guest was Republican Gubernatorial candidate Brian Sandoval. The main guest on her second show was Democratic Gubernatorial candidate Rory Reid. To The Point with Anjeanette Damon airs Saturday's at 6:30 pm. On November 6, 2010 To The Point with Anjeanette Damon debuted Nevada state-wide broadcast, airing on KRNV/KENV and KSNV-DT.12
KRNV became the first station in recent history to produce a local &quot;Coaches-Style&quot; sports show on television featuring University of Nevada Wolf Pack sports.1314 &quot;Wolf Pack All Access&quot; debuted Sunday, September 9, 2012, after Sunday Night Football.15
KENV produces local news inserts during KRNV's shows. On May 5, 2008, that channel began producing a fifteen-minute news and weather insert weekday mornings at 6:45. KENV now offers a one-hour long morning show.
