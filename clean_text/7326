No. 33 Squadron is a Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) transport and air-to-air refuelling squadron controlled by No. 86 Wing, under Air Lift Group.1. It operates five Airbus KC-30A Multi Role Tanker Transports from RAAF Base Amberley, Queensland. The squadron was formed in 1942 for service during World War II, operating Short Empire flying boats and other smaller types. By 1944 it had re-equipped with Douglas C-47 Dakotas, which it operated until disbanding in 1946. The unit was re-established in February 1981 as a flight, flying two Boeing&amp;nbsp;707s for VIP and other long-range transport duties out of RAAF Base Richmond, New South Wales. No. 33 Flight was re-formed as a full squadron in July 1983. By 1988 it was operating six 707s, four of which were subsequently converted for aerial refuelling. It lost one of its transport jets in a crash in October 1991. Having been without aircraft since the retirement of the 707s in June 2008, No. 33 Squadron began re-equipping with KC-30As in June 2011.

No. 33 Squadron was established on 16 February at Townsville, Queensland, under the control of North Eastern Area Command.23 It was equipped with four Short Empire flying boats transferred from No. 11 Squadron, along with a number of smaller types including de Havilland Dragons and Tiger Moths, Avro Ansons and Vultee Vigilants.45 Less than two weeks later the squadron suffered its first loss when one of the Empires was destroyed in a landing accident at Townsville; the six crew members were killed. A second Empire was destroyed at its mooring during a Japanese air attack on Broome, Western Australia, on 3 March; another Empire was impressed from Qantas to replace the lost aircraft. One of the squadron's tasks was search-and-rescue; it lost another Empire on 8 August 1942 after it sank in heavy seas off the coast of New Guinea while trying to rescue survivors of a torpedoed ship.6
No. 33 Squadron transferred to Port Moresby in January 1943, providing air transport to Australian forces involved in the New Guinea campaign. Transport needs were so desperate in New Guinea that even the Tiger Moths were employed, delivering a total of  per trip.7 In September&lt;U+2013&gt;October 1943, the squadron began taking delivery of fifteen Douglas C-47 Dakotas to replace its assortment of aircraft.89 By the time it transferred to Milne Bay on 1 January 1944, it was operating Dakotas exclusively, and continued to do so for the rest of the war. The squadron relocated to Lae on 15 January 1945.10 Following the end of hostilities in August 1945, it was tasked with repatriating service personnel and former prisoners of war.11 No. 33 Squadron returned to Townsville on 11 March 1946, and disbanded there on 13 May.12
Re-establishment
In 1978, the Australian government decided to purchase two passenger jets for strategic transport, primarily to mitigate what it saw as the risk of terrorist attack inherent in carrying VIPs on commercial flights. Its attempts to procure one Boeing 727 each from domestic carriers Ansett and TAA were unsuccessful but, in December, Qantas agreed to sell two Boeing 707s for $14.5 million.13 Purchasing big jets for VIPs was controversial, but the 707s were also intended for general long-range transport.14 The first was transferred to the RAAF in March 1979, and its inaugural Air Force flight took place on 22 April. Located at RAAF Base Richmond, New South Wales, the 707s were initially operated by No. 37 Squadron; they were formed into No. 33 Flight under the command of Wing Commander J.D. Grierson on 2 February 1981.1516 The flight's first mission took place the same day, when it ferried RAAF members and their families to RAAF Base Butterworth, Malaysia, a task that had previously necessitated a Qantas charter.17

One of the airframes was non-flying, for spares only, and was nicknamed &quot;Hulksbury&quot;.2425
A consortium of Israel Aerospace Industries and Hawker de Havilland converted four of No. 33 Squadron's six serviceable aircraft into in-flight refuelling tankers between December 1988 and May 1992.26 Their probe-and-drogue configuration allowed them to refuel the RAAF's F/A-18 Hornets and the Royal New Zealand Air Force's A-4 Skyhawks, but not the RAAF's F-111s, which required a boom system. The other two 707s continued to be used purely for long-range transport.2728 In April 1989, one of the 707s transported 300 Australian Army personnel in two flights to Namibia as part of the Australian contribution to UNTAG, the United Nations Transition Assistance Group policing the country's transition to independence.29 Later that year, the squadron helped ferry members of the Australian public when the two domestic airlines were grounded during an industrial dispute; it was similarly employed in 1991 following the demise of Compass Airlines.30 On 29 October 1991, one of the transport-configured 707s was lost when it crashed into the sea during a training flight out of East Sale, Victoria; all five crew members were killed.31 The coronial inquest into this accident found that training in the asymmetric handling maneuver that caused the crash was deficient, and that the RAAF lacked a proper understanding of the handling characteristics of its 707s.32 No. 33 Squadron transported Australian troops to and from Somalia as part of Operation Solace in 1993.3334
In January 1998, still based at Richmond, No. 33 Squadron joined Nos. 32 and 34 Squadrons under No. 84 Wing.3536 Two of No. 33 Squadron's aircraft were soon employed to form No. 84 Wing Detachment A in Kuwait, as part of Operation Southern Watch. On 5 March, one of the 707s undertook the first operational aerial tanker mission since the squadron's re-formation in 1983, when it refuelled six Panavia Tornados of the Royal Air Force (RAF) over Saudi Arabia. The detachment subsequently refuelled US F/A-18 Hornets, EA-6 Prowlers, and AV-8 Harriers, as well as RAF Harriers, in addition to the Tornados.3738 From March to September 2002, two 707s formed No. 84 Wing Detachment as part of Australia's contribution to the war in Afghanistan.3940 Located at Manas Air Base in Kyrgyzstan, the 707s provided aerial refuelling to coalition aircraft operating in the theatre, their efforts earning No. 84 Wing a Meritorious Unit Citation.4142

Following the retirement of the Boeing 707, No. 33 Squadron relocated to RAAF Base Amberley, Queensland, on 1 July 2008 and temporarily had no aircraft.49 It was subsequently equipped with five Airbus KC-30A Multi Role Tanker Transports, the first being delivered on 1 June 2011.50 The KC-30 could carry one-and-a-half times as much fuel as the 707 and was configured with both probe-and-drogue and boom delivery systems.51 These aircraft had originally been scheduled to enter service late in 2008, and the RAAF had to lease tankers from the United States Air Force and Omega Air to meet its aerial refueling needs while Airbus rectified problems with the boom system and completed essential technical documentation.5253 In March 2012, one of the KC-30s set a record for the number of passengers carried on an RAAF aircraft, 220 cadets from the Australian Defence Force Academy.54 The squadron received its fifth and final KC-30 on 3 December 2012, and achieved initial operating capacity with the type in February 2013.5556
