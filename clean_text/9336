Lieutenant General Clovis E. Byers (5 November 1899 &lt;U+2013&gt; 13 December 1973) was an American soldier and General in the first half of the 20th century. He is best known for his role as Chief of Staff of the Eighth Army in the South West Pacific Area during World War II and in the Occupation of Japan. He also commanded the 82nd Airborne Division, and X Corps in the Korean War.
Education and early life
Clovis Ethelbert Byers was born in Columbus, Ohio on 5 November 1899. He entered the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1916 and was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant in 1920.1
Byers was promoted to First Lieutenant in 1925, and Captain in 1935. He served as a Student Officer at the United States Army Cavalry School from 1930 to 1931, and with the 8th Cavalry Regiment from 1931 to 1932. He was at the United States Military Academy, first as a cadet company commander and then as Assistant Adjutant, from 1932 to 1934. From 1934 to 1936 he attended the Command and General Staff College. He was Aide-de-Camp to Major General Herbert J. Brees, commander of the VIII Corps area, from 1936 to 1937. Byers then joined the 5th Cavalry at Fort Bliss, where he commanded Troop A from 1937 to 1938 and the 1st Squadron from 1938 to 1939. He then attended the U.S. Army War College from 1939 to 1940 and was promoted to Major in 1940.2
World War II
Byers served with G-1 (Personnel) Division, War Department from 1940 to 1942, at a time when the workload of this division was particularly heavy owing to the vast expansion of the Army. He was promoted to wartime rank Lieutenant Colonel in 1941 and Colonel in 1942.3
In 1942, Byers became Chief of Staff of Major General Robert L. Eichelberger's 77th Infantry Division. He followed Eichelberger when the latter became commander of I Corps.4 Byers brought a number of staff members with him from the 77th Infantry Division.5 Byers was promoted to temporary Brigadier General in October 1942.6
 When the Battle of Buna-Gona started going badly, General Douglas MacArthur, the Supreme Commander, South West Pacific Area, decided to send I Corps headquarters to New Guinea. Eichelberger recalled Macarthur's instructions: 
In accordance with MacArthur's orders, Eichelberger relieved the 32nd Infantry Division's commander, Major General Edwin F. Harding, replacing him with the division's artillery commander, Brigadier General Albert W. Waldron, on 2 December 1942.7 In an attack on 5 December, Waldron was shot in the shoulder by a Japanese sniper,8 and Byers succeeded him as commander of the troops in the field.9 Byers in turn was wounded on 16 December. He became the American third general to be shot at Buna, none of whom was more than 75 metres from Japanese lines at the time.10 General Eichelberger assumed command, as he was now the only American general officer present. Waldron and Byers were awarded the Distinguished Service Cross.11 In turn, Byers recommended Eichelberger for the Medal of Honor but the nomination was disapproved by MacArthur.12
Byers had plenty of time to recover, as I Corps would not be committed to operations again until Operations Reckless and Persecution in April 1944. Lieutenant General Walter Krueger, commander of the Sixth Army offered to make Byers an assistant division commander. When Byers refused the offer, Krueger took this as a personal affront.13
At Lone Tree Hill, Byers was nearly killed in a Japanese ambush but an unwitting group of signalmen sprung the trap instead. Byers continued with his mission to report on the state of affairs at the front.14
In August 1944, Eighth Army headquarters arrived in the New Guinea and Eichelberger became commander of the new army.15 Once again, Byers followed him as his chief of staff.16 Byers remained Chief of Staff through the Eighth Army's operations on Leyte, Luzon, the Visayas, and Mindanao. After hostilities ended, the Eighth Army participated in the Occupation of Japan. Eichelberger remained commander and Byers remained his Chief of Staff until Eichelberger retired in 1948.
Korean War
On returning to the United States in 1948, Byers became commander of the 82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. In 1949, he returned to Washington, DC as Deputy Assistant Army Chief of Staff G-1 (Personnel).17
In July 1951, Byers replaced Major General Edward Almond as commander of X Corps, then engaged in combat in Korea. As such, Byers was in overall command at the Battle of Heartbreak Ridge and the Battle of Bloody Ridge.
Later life
Byers became commander of XVI Corps in 1952. He served as Chief of Staff of Allied Forces Southern Europe (AFSOUTH) from 1952 to 1954 and then commander of X Corps again. He was Deputy Commandant of the National War College from 1954 to 1955 and then Commandant of the NATO Defence College from 1955 to 1957.18
Byers was promoted to the substantive rank of Brigadier General, United States Army in 1948, Major General in 1952, and Lieutenant General in 1955.19
Byers retired from the army in June 1959.20 He died on 13 December 1973 and was buried in Arlington National Cemetery. His papers are in the Hoover Institution.
