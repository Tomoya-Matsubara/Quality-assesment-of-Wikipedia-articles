Mohammad Moin Khan (Urdu: &lt;U+0645&gt;&lt;U+062D&gt;&lt;U+0645&gt;&lt;U+062F&gt; &lt;U+0645&gt;&lt;U+0639&gt;&lt;U+06CC&gt;&lt;U+0646&gt; &lt;U+062E&gt;&lt;U+0627&gt;&lt;U+0646&gt;; born 23 September 1971), popularly known as Moin Khan (Urdu: &lt;U+0645&gt;&lt;U+0639&gt;&lt;U+06CC&gt;&lt;U+0646&gt; &lt;U+062E&gt;&lt;U+0627&gt;&lt;U+0646&gt;), is a former Pakistani cricketer, primarily a wicketkeeper-batsman, who remained a member of the Pakistani national cricket team from 1990 to 2004. He has also captained the Pakistani side. He made his international debut against the West Indies at Multan. He took over 100 catches in Test cricket. He has scored over 3,000 ODI runs and taken over 200 catches in ODI cricket. He is credited with coining the name of Saqlain Mushtaq's mystery delivery that goes from leg to off, as the doosra. It means the &quot;other one&quot; in Urdu. In July 2013, he replaced Iqbal Qasim as the chief selector of the Pakistan cricket team.1
Career
Throughout his international career, Moin had to compete with another wicket-keeper, Rashid Latif. Moin kept wickets in the 1992 Cricket World Cup which Pakistan won and the 1999 Cricket World Cup where Pakistan finished runners up. Latif kept wickets in the 1996 Cricket World Cup and the 2003 Cricket World Cup. Despite close rivalries, Moin is mostly remembered as the better player as their performance after the glove-work came onto how they batted. Despite having a significantly similar Test batting average, Moin had a higher ODI average than Latif and scored more runs than Latif in international cricket.
During the 1992 Cricket World Cup Semi-final against New Zealand, Pakistan needed 9 runs for 8 balls before Moin Khan hit a six to make it 3 runs off 7 balls. Then, Javed Miandad scored the winning boundary and Pakistan setup a clash in the world cup final with England. In the world cup final, Pakistan were 249 from 50 overs with Moin Khan not getting a chance to bat. However, he took three catches in the match including one of Ian Botham who went for a duck against an inswinger bowled by Wasim Akram.2
In 2005, Moin scored the first century in Pakistan domestic Twenty20 cricket when he smashed 112 off 59 balls for Karachi Dolphins against Lahore Lions in the ABN-AMRO Twenty-20 Cup. At the end of the season, he retired from cricket finishing with 200 not out against Hyderabad, his highest first class score.
In 2007, Moin signed with the unofficial Indian Cricket League and coached the Hyderabad Heroes. In the 2008 edition of the competition, he coached the expansion team, the Lahore Badshahs.
