Circus Juventas (formerly Circus of the Star) is a youth performing arts circus school located in Saint Paul, Minnesota, and serving youth throughout the Minneapolis-Saint Paul metropolitan area. The organization was founded in 1994 by Dan and Betty Butler, and offers circus arts training to young people ranging in age from 3&lt;U+2013&gt;21.
Emulating the style of Cirque du Soleil, Circus Juventas's first show was at Saint Paul's Highland Fest in 1995. From there, the school's enrollment quickly expanded and the organization initiated a campaign to fund a $2.1 million permanent big top facility which opened in 2001 on Saint Paul parkland in the Highland Park neighborhood. That year, it began to produce annual summer performances showcasing the work of its most advanced students, each with a distinct theme.
These shows have proven popular with local audiences and have been well received critically, with reviewers praising the professionalism and fearlessness exhibited in the productions, while noting the occasional mishap of the school's performers. In addition, Circus Juventas students have performed and competed both around the Minneapolis-Saint Paul area and abroad. Today, Juventas is the largest youth performing arts circus in North America and it has tentative plans to add a second facility elsewhere in the region.
History
Dan and Betty Butler met as teenagers at the Sailor Circus of Sarasota during the mid-1970s.1 Dan was a catcher on the flying trapeze, while Betty was an aerialist on the cloud swing.2 They began dating at age sixteen3 and both went on to perform at Florida State University's Flying High Circus.4 Dan became a successful real estate broker in Atlanta, but eventually faced bankruptcy and chemical dependency.5 The couple came to reside in Minnesota because Dan Butler was receiving alcohol and drug abuse rehabilitation at Hazelden.6 The Butlers attended Sailor Circus reunions together and after one, in April 1994, Betty Butler wondered, &quot;Wouldn't it be great if we could do something in &quot;7
 The Butlers founded Circus Juventas as a non-profit corporation in October 1994,8 citing a desire to give back to the community as one of the reasons for its creation.9 It was originally known as Circus of the Star, so-called for Minnesota's nickname, The North Star State.10 The newly opened Hillcrest Recreation Center in Saint Paul provided the couple with inspiration for the circus program, and they asked the city if they could hold classes there.11 The Saint Paul Parks and Recreation Department approved the program, and assumed liability for approximately fifty children who enrolled the first year.12 About thirty of those students stayed with the program and performed in their first show13 at the 1995 Highland Fest, an annual family-oriented festival.14 After this performance, interest in the program increased.15 By 1996, around thirty more students were enrolled, and by 1997, an additional twenty-five had joined the program.16 The circus was still based out of the Hillcrest Recreation Center's gym, and had to work around the schedule of the other regular activities in the facility.17 In 1997, the waitlist for the program was around 200 students.18
With the school's growing popularity, the Butlers saw the need for a larger space so they developed plans to build a 1,500-seat facility.19 In an article published in the St. Paul Pioneer Press in 1997, the estimated cost of the project was quoted at $700,000 with a groundbreaking planned for April 1998.20 The Butlers kicked off their capital campaign on February 18, 1998, with the goal of raising $1.1 million for their new building.21 By August 1999, they had raised $1 million of their expanded $1.6 million goal for the circus expansion, with plans to break ground on the new facility that November.22 Part of the funding came from Saint Paul's Sales Tax Revitalization (STAR) program, through which surplus funds were distributed by councilmembers to worthy organizations.23 A total of $627,183 were disbursed for the circus through the program, split between three STAR components: $450,000 as part of Neighborhood STAR which sought to fund neighborhood initiatives, $122,183 as part of Cultural STAR which funded arts and culture programs, and $55,000 from 3rd Ward City Councilmember Pat Harris's discretionary Neighborhood Investment Initiative budget.24 Another $60,000 came from an anonymous recently retired Saint Paul businessperson.25
 The $1.6 million were raised in full by the end of April 2000, just in time to ensure the circus received its STAR funding which would have been nullified if the Butlers hadn't made their fundraising goal by May 5 of that year.26 The Butlers had found the space for the school through coincidence; after driving along Montreal Avenue in Saint Paul one night, they turned into a parking lot, noticed an area beneath some trees, and realized it was an ideal location for their school's expanded facility.27 On August 25, 2000, ground was broken on the new structure.28 The big top took about a year to complete, during which time the school also changed its name to Circus Juventas, named for Juventas, an ancient Roman goddess of youth and rejuvenation.29 Ultimately, the project totaled $2.1 million30 and by 2006, the school was $700,000 in debt.31 It was, however, working with various city agencies to resolve the issue and faced &quot;no looming threat&quot;.32 The school relies heavily on parent volunteers to help with various operational aspects, from rigging to administrative work to set construction and decoration.33 Betty Butler estimated that 90% of work on the school's shows is done by parent volunteers.34 The circus operates with the equivalent of 40 full-time employees.35
As of 2010, the circus school enrolled students from ages six to 21, with an additional enrollment of about 150 toddlers and other younger participants as young as three years old. By 2013, the enrollment had reached over 800 and the school's annual operating budget exceeded $2 million. Circus Juventas has also held circus arts fitness classes for adults, taught by the school's regular instructors.36 The school is a member of the Outdoor Amusement Business Association and the F&lt;U+00E9&gt;d&lt;U+00E9&gt;ration Mondiale du Cirque.37 A listing on the latter organization's website notes that as of 2014, Juventas is the largest performing arts circus school for youth in the United States;38 other sources indicate that it is the largest in all of North America.394041
Facilities
Circus Juventas's big top is located in the Highland Park neighborhood of Saint Paul, Minnesota.42 It stands  tall and encompasses  of floor space43 built on concrete slab. The structure is supported by an aluminum frame and covered with flame-resistant vinyl-coated cloth.44 The building's  lobby space was designed by Locus Architecture, Ltd. of Minneapolis. The firm connected texteline fabric (often used for awnings) to the system of catwalks and supports to help &quot;the lobby act...as an immersion tank, rather than a threshold, to introduce spectators to the illusion of the world of circus.&quot; Although Locus was still installing the fabric within hours of the circus's gala opening, the company won one of the 10 honor awards distributed in 2002 by the Minnesota branch of the American Institute of Architects for their design.45 The circus school's original bleachers could seat 1,200 audiencemembers.46
Bleacher collapse
 On August 16, 2009, at the closing performance of the show Yulong, a set of bleachers with a carrying capacity of 450 people and holing 420 at the time collapsed, sending seven people to the hospital.4748 In the ensuing investigation, it came to light that Juventas had not had the bleachers inspected each time they were set up, as required by their lease with the city.49 They had been issued a permit in 2006 for the bleachers, and had not had them inspected since.50 The school was fined $500 and shut down until the legal and safety issues could be fully investigated.51 It reopened about a month later52 and installed new bleachers with molded plastic seats the next March.53
Future
In early 2014, the Butlers announced plans to expand their big top facility by an additional .54 The additional space will house a dance and theater studio, a costume shop, offices, and a  gym.55 Naming rights for the new structure will provide a component of the $4 million the school hopes to raise for the $2 million expansion, a $1 million addition to the circus's endowment, and eventual repairs to the building's exterior, estimated at $1 million.56 Betty Butler stated that the project stemmed from the desire to create &quot;a true professional program, a separate program&quot; for students looking to study and perform circus arts post-Juventas, even though she and her husband originally shied away from pre-professional training as a core aspect of their circus school.57
According to Saint Paul's Parks and Recreation Department, the cliffside space which the expansion would occupy is unsuitable for building a structure of the expansion's proposed size.58 In response, the Butlers are considering building a new facility of up to  in the western suburbs of Minneapolis&lt;U+2013&gt;Saint Paul.59 Construction of a new building would likely cost $10 million and would require a capital campaign to fund60 and would likely not begin for five to 10 years.61 In the meantime, the school is performing a small expansion to their Highland Park space, on which the Circus has a lease for at least 17 more years, as of 2014.62
Performances
 The school typically puts on two shows per year: a spring performance featuring less advanced students studying circus arts at beginning and intermediate levels, and a late summer show to display the talents of more advanced students.63 While the earliest shows were focused primarily on technique and the individual acts, by 1997 or 1998 the school began to put more focus into the artistic side of performances, including integrating said acts into Cirque du Soleil-style narratives, according to Dan Butler.

T. Rybak's 2002 inauguration at the Minneapolis City Hall,93 the Ordway Center for the Performing Arts as part of the Flint Hills International Children's Festival,94 on Ecolab Plaza,95 Nicollet Mall,96 and with the Shrine Circus in Minneapolis.97 Students have also participated non-Juventas shows, including a 2004 Minnesota Fringe Festival production,98 the 2005 world premiere of Tin Forest with the Minnesota Orchestra at Orchestra Hall,99 the local Children's Theatre Company's 2008 stage adaptation of Madeline and the Gypsies,100 and the 2012 adaptation of Jack Prelutsky's The Dragons Are Singing Tonight at The Southern Theater.101 Outside of the Minneapolis&lt;U+2013&gt;Saint Paul area, Juventas students have traveled, including to perform at the RiverRocks Festival in Chattanooga, Tennessee,102 and to compete, including at the International Circus Festival in Latina, Italy,103 and at the Circus Ring of Friendship Festival in Norrk&lt;U+00F6&gt;ping, Sweden, in which the troupe's triple trapeze team garnered the gold medal.104
Music
Much of the accompaniment for the big top summer shows came from local mandolin player Peter Ostroushko.105 Ostrouchko, known for his work on the radio show A Prairie Home Companion,106 became involved in the youth circus after his daughter saw a show and decided to join.107 In 2005, upon discovering his affinity for the mandolin and fiddle, the Butlers asked if Ostroushko would volunteer to play a Celtic song at the permiere of their upcoming summer big top show, Dyrnwych.108 He happily agreed, having expressed a lifelong dream of joining a circus, and played the track, &quot;See It There/Con Cassidy's&quot;, not only at Dyrnwych{{'s}} opening but also at each of its subsequent 18 performances.109 The following year, he composed original music for the 2006 Juventas show, Pazzanni, and expanded his band to five members, including himself on mandolin, fiddle, and mandocello, Marc Anderson on percussion, Dan Chouinard on piano, accordion, and keyboard, Dirk Freymuth on electric and acoustic guitars, and Joel Sayles on electric and acoustic bass guitars.110 Ostroushko again provided a score for Atlanticus and RavensManor,111 continued in 2010 with Sawdust,112 then Grimm,113 and finally Showdown.114 Tracks from the first four shows for which he played, from Dyrnwych to RavensManor, are anthologized on the CD Peter Joins the Circus, published by Borderland Productions in 2008.115
Reception
Jando Dominique, reporting for Spectacle: An Online Journal of Circus Arts, summarized audience and critical reception for Circus Juventas's shows by describing them as &quot;always sold out and enthusiastically reviewed by the press&quot;.116 Renee Valois cited the age of the performers and the proximity between them and the audience when she asked in a St. Paul Pioneer Press review of Oz comparing the circus school with Cirque du Soleil, &quot;Dare I say Circus Juventas is more exciting than the troupe that inspired it?&quot;117 Writing for Minnesota Monthly, Amanda Bankston commended the technical skill and professionalism of the performers in 2012's Showdown: &quot; is nothing child-like about the talent in this show. The budding stars fearlessly swing, flip, and soar through the air like pros.&quot;118 In Spectacle, Dominique noted that Juventas's productions consistently have &quot;a polish and style not often seen in youth circuses, or most professional ones, for that matter.&quot;119
Susannah Schouweiler of Knight Arts wrote, &quot;at two hours and 45 minutes, plus a 20-minute intermission, [Grimm{{'s}}] run time is an awfully long haul for the smallest circus-goers.&quot;120 Critics have also commented on the occasional misstep in a performance; Rohan Preston noted in his review of Grimm that &quot;there are moments -- just a few stand out -- when you realize that these are students, after all, in a celebrated after-school program. You want them to succeed, even if they do not always.&quot;121 Similarly, writing for BroadwayWorld, Elaina Lenertz stated, &quot;Sometimes their silks routines are a bit out of sync and sometimes the show features dance routines from younger kids who are still mastering stunts. Despite this, the performance is very impressive.&quot;122
