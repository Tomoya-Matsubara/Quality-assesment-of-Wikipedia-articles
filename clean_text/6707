Gerard Michael &quot;Gerry&quot; Kelly (18 September 1908 &lt;U+2013&gt; 1983) was an English footballer.
Playing career
Kelly left Hylton Colliery at the age of 19 to sign for Sunderland in 1927. He never made the first team and the following year joined Nelson, who he played almost 50 games for. He signed with Huddersfield Town in 1929 and in two years with the club scored 15 goals in 37 league appearances.1 In 1932 he signed with Charlton Athletic, staying for a year before joining Chester City. He made 73 appearances for Chester over four years with the club, before joining Port Vale for 'a substantial fee' in June 1936. Starting off firmly in the first 11, his place slipped away over the 1936&lt;U+2013&gt;37 season and by August 1937 he was given a free transfer to Southampton.2
A very quick right-winger who could also play as a centre-forward, he arrived at The Dell to add depth to the Southampton forward line. Although he brought a wealth of experience with him, he spent most of his time in the reserves and in his two years on the south coast, he made only 19 first-team appearances, scoring twice.3
Following the outbreak of the Second World War his professional career ended and he retired from the game.4
