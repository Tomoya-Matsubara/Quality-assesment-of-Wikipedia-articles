Liverpool defender John Arne Riise dispossessed Hargreaves, McAllister took control of the loose ball and passed to Steven Gerrard.

Liverpool's victory meant that they had won five competitions in five months, after winning the FA Cup, Football League Cup and UEFA Cup during the 2000&lt;U+2013&gt;01 season. They had also won the FA Charity Shield at the start of the current season. Manager G&lt;U+00E9&gt;rard Houllier congratulated his players on their achievements: &quot;I must congratulate the players for what they achieved in these six months. We know we are not perfect and we will continue to improve. But the team have shown they possess the winning edge, and this is what we have tried to develop.&quot; As man of the match Owen received a &lt;U+00A3&gt;10,000 cheque from match sponsors Carlsberg to be forwarded to a charity of his choice.25
