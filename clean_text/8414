History
ChristianCinema.com was founded in 1999 in Visalia, California, by brothers, Kevin and Bobby Downes (who is also a CEO), and their friend Geoff Ludlow. They wanted to make movies and create a system for independent filmmakers to distribute their films.3 Bobby designed the website in the small house where he lived, Kevin shipped the first movie from his home, and they three produced their first movie, The Moment After, the same year.4 It has been shown on the Trinity Broadcasting Network, and its website gives filmmakers a place to submit screening copies of their work with the possibility of being distributed and promoted by the website.5 The company now has its own warehouse and 13 employees.6 Angela Walker (director of producer relations) sends a weekly e-newsletter to almost 28,000 people, with recommendations about new releases and more.7 Jared Geesey is the Vice President of marketing for ChristianCinema.com.8
