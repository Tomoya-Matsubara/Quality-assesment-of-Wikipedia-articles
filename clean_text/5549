Chattanooga is the fourth-largest city in the U.S. state of Tennessee (after Memphis, Nashville and Knoxville), and the seat of Hamilton County. Located in southeastern Tennessee on Chickamauga Lake and Nickajack Lake, which are both part of the Tennessee River, Chattanooga lies approximately  to the north-northwest of Atlanta, Georgia,  to the southwest of Knoxville, about  to the southeast of Nashville, and about  to the northeast of Birmingham, Alabama. Chattanooga abuts the Georgia border, and the region is at the junction of three major interstate highways, I-24, I-75, and I-59.
The city, which has a downtown elevation of approximately , lies at the transition between the ridge-and-valley portion of the Appalachian Mountains and the Cumberland Plateau. The city is therefore surrounded by various mountains and ridges. The official nickname for Chattanooga is the Scenic City.
Chattanooga is ranked 8th out of Americas 100 largest metro areas for the best &quot;Bang For Your Buck&quot; city according to Forbes magazine.1 The study measured overall affordability, housing rates, and more.
History
The first inhabitants of the Chattanooga area were Native Americans. Sites dating back to the Upper Paleolithic period showed continuous occupation through the Archaic, Woodland, Mississippian/Muskogean (900&lt;U+2013&gt;1650), and Cherokee (1776&lt;U+2013&gt;1838) periods.
The first part of the name &quot;Chattanooga&quot; derives from the Muskogean word cvto /chat&lt;U+00F3&gt;/ &lt;U+2013&gt; 'rock'.2 The latter may be derived from a regional suffix -nunga meaning dwelling or dwelling place.
Cherokee Chief John Ross, whose first language was English and whose family moved to the area in the 19th century, was said to have stated3 that Chattanooga was Cherokee for &quot;The Big Catch&quot; because of good fishing on the Tennessee River.
A late 19th century history recounted: 
The earliest Cherokee occupation dates from Dragging Canoe, who in 1776 separated himself and moved downriver from the main tribe to establish American Indian resistance (see Chickamauga Wars) to European settlement in the southeastern United States. In 1816 John Ross, who later became Principal Chief, settled here and established Ross's Landing. Located along what is now Broad Street, it became one of the centers of Cherokee Nation settlement, which also extended into Georgia and Alabama.4
In 1838 the US government forced the Cherokees, along with other American Indians from southeastern U.S. states, to relocate in what is presently the state of Oklahoma. Their journey west became known as the &quot;Trail of Tears&quot; for their exile and fatalities along the way. The US Army used Ross's Landing as the site of one of three large internment camps, or &quot;emigration depots&quot;, where Native Americans were held prior to the journey on the Trail of Tears. The other two were Fort Payne, Alabama and the largest at Fort Cass, Tennessee.5
In 1838, the community of Ross's Landing incorporated as the city of Chattanooga, the Creek word for Lookout Mountain.6 The city grew quickly, initially benefiting from a location well-suited for river commerce. With the arrival of the railroad in 1850, Chattanooga became a boom town. The city was known as the site &quot;where cotton meets corn,&quot; referring to its location along the cultural boundary between the mountain communities of Southern Appalachia to the north and the cotton-growing states to the south.7

Confederate prisoners of war at a railroad depot in Chattanooga

During the American Civil War, Chattanooga was a center of battle. During the Chickamauga Campaign, Union artillery bombarded Chattanooga as a diversion and occupied it on September 9, 1863. Following the Battle of Chickamauga, the defeated Union Army retreated to safety in Chattanooga. On November 23, 1863, the Battles for Chattanooga began when Union forces led by Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant reinforced troops at Chattanooga and advanced to Orchard Knob against Confederate troops besieging the city. The next day, the Battle of Lookout Mountain was fought, driving the Confederates off the mountain. On November 25, Grant's army routed the Confederates in the Battle of Missionary Ridge. These battles were followed the next spring by the Atlanta Campaign, beginning just over the nearby state line in Georgia and moving southeastward.

Market Street in 1907

After the war ended, the city became a major railroad hub and industrial and manufacturing center.8 By the 1930s it was known as the &quot;Dynamo of Dixie&quot;, inspiring the 1941 Glenn Miller big-band swing song &quot;Chattanooga Choo Choo&quot;. The same mountains that provided Chattanooga's scenic backdrop became shrouded by the industrial pollutants that they trapped and held over the community.
In 1969, the federal government declared that Chattanooga's air was the dirtiest in the nation. But environmental crises were not the only problems plaguing the city. Like other early industrial cities, Chattanooga entered the 1980s with serious socioeconomic challenges, including job layoffs due to de-industrialization, a deteriorating city infrastructure, racial tensions and social division. Because of these factors, Chattanooga's population declined by more than 10% in the 1980s. However, Chattanooga was the only major U.S. city to lose this proportion of its population in the 1980s and then regain growth in the next two decades.9
In recent years, private and governmental resources have been invested in transforming the city's tarnished image. They have worked to revitalize its downtown and riverfront areas, making use of its natural resources.1011 An early cornerstone of this project was the restoration of the historic Walnut Street Bridge. The Walnut Street Bridge is the oldest surviving bridge of its kind in the Southeastern United States.12
Efforts to improve the city include the &quot;21st Century Waterfront Plan&quot; &lt;U+2013&gt; a $120 million redevelopment of the Chattanooga waterfront and downtown area. The Tennessee Aquarium has become a major waterfront attraction that has helped to spur neighborhood development.13 Over the last ten years the city has won three national awards for outstanding &quot;livability&quot;, and nine Gunther Blue Ribbon Awards for excellence in housing and consolidated planning.14

There is also a Vulcan Materials quarry in the vicinity of the city.
On July 15, 2008, Volkswagen Group of America announced plans to build its new production facility in Chattanooga.15 The $1 billion plant, due to open in 2011, will serve as the group's North American manufacturing headquarters. The plant is the first for Volkswagen since the 1988 closure of New Stanton, Pennsylvania's auto plant.16
In addition to corporate business interests, there are many retail shops in Chattanooga, including three shopping malls: Hamilton Place Mall in East Brainerd, Northgate Mall in Hixson, and Eastgate Mall in Brainerd.
Utilities

Chickamauga Lock and Dam on the Tennessee River at Chattanooga

Electric power for most of the city and surrounding area is provided by the city-run Electric Power Board (EPB). Beginning in the summer of 2009, the EPB is also providing high-speed Internet service, video, and telephone service to business and residential customers throughout Hamilton County.17 The services that the EPB is providing to residents and businesses in Hamilton County is done via what will be the nation's largest municipally owned fiber-optic system.18 The TVA operates the nearby Sequoyah Nuclear Power Plant, Chickamauga Dam and the Raccoon Mountain Pumped-Storage Plant, all of which provide electricity to the greater Chattanooga area. TVA's corporate power generation and distribution organization is also headquartered in downtown Chattanooga.
Natural gas and water are provided by the privately run Chattanooga Gas Company and Tennessee-American Water Company, respectively. In 2005 Mayor Ron Littlefield stated his desire for the city to purchase the Tennessee-American Water Company,19 which was sold in a public offering in 2007.20 Former Mayor Jon Kinsey's attempts to have the city buy control of Tennessee-American Water were defeated in court.
Comcast is the cable provider for most areas of the city. The incumbent telephone company is AT&amp;T. However, competing phone companies, cellular phones and VoIP are beginning to make inroads. A major interstate fiber optics line operated by AT&amp;T traverses the city, making its way from Atlanta to Cincinnati.
Politics, government and law
The current mayor is Ron Littlefield, a long-time city councilman, who was elected in a run-off election in April 2005. Mayor Littlefield was reelected to a second four year term in March 2009.
The city operates under a charter granted by the state legislature in 1852, and the charter has been subsequently amended. As of 2010, the city operates under a strong mayor system.
The city's legislative branch is split up into nine districts, with a council member for each district selected in partisan elections. The current council members are Deborah Scott (District 1), Sally Robinson (District 2), Pam Ladd (District 3), Jack Benson (District 4), Russell Gilbert (District 5), Carol Berz (District 6), Manuel &quot;Manny&quot; Rico (District 7), Andrae McGary (District 8) and Peter Murphy (District 9).

Railroad lines
 
Despite a new emphasis on the technology and service sectors, Chattanooga maintains ties to the past and still serves as a major freight hub with Norfolk Southern (NS) and CSX running trains on their own (and each other's) lines. The Norfolk Southern Railway's enormous DeButts Yard is just east of downtown, Shipp's Yard and CSX's Wauhatchie Yard are southwest of the city. Indeed, the two railroad companies are among the largest individual landowners in the city (the Federal Government is another). The Tennessee Valley Railroad Museum, the largest historic operating railroad in the South, and the Chattooga and Chickamauga Railway also provides railroad service in Chattanooga.
Since both NS and CSX both run through Chattanooga, here are the lines that run through the town (the AAR codes are used for the following railroads: NS for Norfolk Southern, CSXT for CSX Transportation, TNVR for the Tennessee Valley Railroad Museum, and CCKY for Chattooga and Chickamauga Railway):

CSXT &lt;U+2013&gt; Western &amp; Atlantic Subdivision (Chattanooga to Atlanta, Georgia)

formerly the Central of Georgia line (Chattanooga to Lyerly, Georgia)


Also, the Lookout Mountain Incline Railway, often referred to as the Incline Railway by locals, as well as being a tourist attraction, is sometimes used for commuting by Lookout Mountain residents, particularly during wintry weather, when travelling up and down the mountain could be very dangerous.
Despite the relatively high level of freight rail activity, there is no passenger rail service in the city for either commuters or long-distance travelers.
Bridges

Bridges in Chattanooga

Being bisected by a major waterway, Chattanooga has several large bridges that allow people to traverse the Tennessee River. They are, from west to east:

P.R. Olgiati Bridge &lt;U+2013&gt; Named for a former mayor, P.R. Olgiati, this bridge, which was dedicated in 1959, carries &quot;27&quot; from downtown to Dayton, Tennessee and points northward.73


Market Street Bridge &lt;U+2013&gt; Officially called the John Ross Bridge. It is a bascule span, which is a type of drawbridge. The bridge was completed in 1917 for the then-astronomical sum of USD $1,000,000. Having stood for decades since its last major overhaul, the Tennessee Department of Transportation declared it unsafe in late 2004. The bridge was closed in 2005 for a long-overdue renovation and reopened on August 4, 2007.74


Walnut Street Bridge &lt;U+2013&gt; Also known as &quot;The Walking Bridge&quot;, it is one of the centerpieces of Chattanooga's urban renewal, and is the second longest pedestrian bridge in the nation. Constructed in 1891, the bridge was declared unsafe and closed to traffic in 1978. It was on the verge of being demolished in the late 1980s when public demand led to it being restored as a pedestrian-only span that opened in 1993.7576


Veterans Memorial Bridge &lt;U+2013&gt; Completed in 1984, this structure has helped commuters from Hixson, Lupton City and other northern areas reach downtown quickly.77


C.B. Robinson Bridge &lt;U+2013&gt; Opened in 1981, this bridge carries Dupont Parkway from Amnicola Highway to Hixson Pike and Route 153.78


Tennessee River Railroad Bridge &lt;U+2013&gt; Also called &quot;Tennbridge,&quot; this truss bridge with a vertical lift carries the Cincinnati, New Orleans and Texas Pacific Railway over the river and is a popular railfan area. It was constructed in 1920.79


Wilkes T. Thrasher Bridge &lt;U+2013&gt; Completed in 1955, this route carries Highway 153 over the Chickamauga Dam.80

Newspapers

The Chattanooga Times Free Press headquarters

The Chattanooga Times Free Press, the area's only daily newspaper, is published every morning. It was effectively formed in 1999 from two papers that had been bitter rivals for half a century, the Times and the News-Free Press. The Times was once owned by Adolph Ochs, who later bought the New York Times. The Times had been the morning paper and had a generally more liberal editorial page. The News-Free Press, whose name was the result of an earlier merger, was an afternoon daily and its editorials were more conservative than those in the Times. In 1999, the Free Press was bought by an Arkansas company, WEHCO Media, publisher of the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, which then bought The Times from the Ochs heirs. The Times Free Press is the only known newspaper in the United States to have 2 editorial pages, each reflecting opposite ends of the political spectrum. The Times' editorial page, which is liberal, is on the left page and the Free Press' editorial page, which is conservative, is on the right page.82
The &quot;Chattanooga Pulse&quot; is a weekly alternative newspaper, published every Thursday. It was formed in 2003 by Zachary Cooper and Michael Kull, running independently until 2008, when the paper was purchased by local broadcast radio and website development firm Brewer Media Group. The newspaper shares news gathering resources with Brewer Media Group's WPLZ Pulse News 95.3FM news talk radio station, and the www.chattanoogapulse.com news website.
