Joany Badenhorst (born 10 August 1994) is an Australian Paralympian who was selected to compete in para-snowboard cross at the 2014 Winter Paralympics in Sochi. She was the first female snowboarder to represent Australia at the Winter Paralympics, but was forced to withdraw her event at the Sochi Games after suffering an injury to her left knee whilst training on the morning of the event.
Personal
Joany Badenhorst was born on 10 August in 1994 in Harrismith, South Africa.1 Her mother Petro is a teacher and her father Peter is an architect. She has two bothers &lt;U+2013&gt; Garrett and Peter.2 She attended Harrismith Primary School.3
On 12 July 2005, whilst playing with a group of friends on her family farm, her trousers were caught in the power take-off shaft of the tractor that was clearing firebreaks.45 This resulted in her left leg being severed below the knee.6 The tractor driver died in a bushfire a month later.7 Her family moved to Australia in 2009 to receive better medical assistance.8 In early 2011, she underwent surgery to rectify problems with her leg following her amputation.9 She currently lives in Griffith, New South Wales, but stays in Jindabyne during the Australian ski season.10
Career
Before her accident, Badenhorst was an accomplished athlete who had won provincial colours in high jump and modern dance.11 After her accident, she was fitted with a prosthetic leg and came second in the school 100 metres event. 12 She joined the South African Paralympic program and competed at the 2009 Paralympic Youth Games.13 She narrowly missed qualifying for the Australian athletics team for the 2012 Summer Paralympics in London.14
The Australian Paralympic snowboarding coach Peter Higgins identified Badenhorst as likely snowboarder after the London Games, and she commenced training in this sport. In taking up snowboarding, she needed a new custom-made leg. Badenhorst said: &quot;I need a special leg that has to be engineered differently to accommodate the different pressures and angles of snowboarding&quot;.15
In the lead up to the 2014 Sochi Games, Badenhorst competed and trained in the Netherlands, Austria and the United States.16 By February 2014, she was ranked eighth in the world. She was forced to withdraw her event at the Sochi Games after suffering an injury to her left knee whilst training on the morning of the event.17
