Andrei Pervozvanny lang-ru  Saint Andrew St Andrew the First-Called was a sclass Andrei Pervozvanny battleship 0 predreadnought battleship built for the Imperial Russian Navy during the mid-1900s. The ship's construction was seriously extended by design changes as a result of the Russo-Japanese War and labor unrest after the 1905 Revolution, and she took nearly six years to build. Andrei Pervozvanny was not very active during World War I and her bored sailors joined the general mutiny of the Baltic Fleet in early 1917. She was used by the Bolsheviks to bombard the rebellious garrison of Krasnaya Gorka fort Fort Krasnaya Gorka during the Russian Civil War in 1919 and was British Campaign in the Baltic 19181919   torpedoed by British Coastal Motor Boats shortly afterwards, as part of the allied intervention in the Russian Civil War.

Description
Andrei Pervozvanny was convert 454 ft m 1 length at the waterline long at the waterline and convert 460 ft m 1 long length overall overall. She had a Beam nautical beam of convert  80 ft m 1 and a Draft hull   draft of convert  27 ft m 1.  She displaced convert  18580 LT t at deep load.  Her hull was subdivided by 17 transverse watertight bulkhead partition bulkheads and the engine rooms were divided by a centerline longitudinal bulkhead. She had a double bottom and a metacentric height of convert 4 ft m 1. The ship's crew consisted of 31 officers and 924 crewmen.McLaughlin, pp. 18081, 185

Andrei Pervozvanny had two 4-cylinder Marine steam engine#Triple or multiple expansion   vertical triple-expansion steam engines with a total designed output of convert  17600 ihp lk=on. Twenty-five Belleville water-tube boilers provided steam to the engines at a working pressure of convert 285 psi kPa kg/cm2 lk=on. On sea trials, the engines produced convert 17635 ihp abbr=on and a top speed of convert 18.5 knots. She carried a normal load of convert 800 LT t of coal that provided a range of convert 1300 nmi lk=in at a speed of convert 12 kn and a maximum load of convert 1500 LT t that gave convert 2400 nmi at the same speed.McLaughlin, pp. 181, 187

The main armament consisted of two pairs of Russian 12 inch 40 caliber naval gun convert 12 in adj=on 0 Model 1895 40-caliber artillery caliber guns mounted in twin-gun turrets fore and aft.

For defense against torpedo boats, Andrei Pervozvanny carried twelve convert 120 mm adj=on sp=us guns mounted in casemates above the 8-inch guns in the superstructure. Two underwater convert 450 mm adj=on sp=us torpedo tubes were mounted, one on each side, and they were provided with six spare torpedoes.McLaughlin, p. 186 

Based on the Russian experience at the Battle of Tsushima, the sides of the ship's hull were completely protected by Krupp cemented armor. The main waterline Belt armor belt had a maximum thickness of convert 8.5 in 0 and the upper belt was convert 5 in 0 at its thickest. The sides of the main gun turrets were convert 8 in 0 thick and the armor of the casemates ranged from convert 3.1 to 5 in 0 in thickness. The greatest thickness of deck ship deck armor was convert 1.5 in 0.McLaughlin, p. 181

Service history
Andrei Pervozvanny was built by the Admiralty Shipyard in Saint Petersburg. Construction began on 15 March 1904All dates used in this article are Old Style and New Style dates New Style and was officially laid down on 11 May. Her construction was slowed by labor trouble in the shipyard from the 1905 Revolution. She was launched on 30 October 1906 and began her sea trials in September 1910. They were completed in October 1910, but the ship entered service on 10 March 1911.McLaughlin, p. 180 Andrei Pervozvanny joined the Baltic Fleet on completion and she made a port visit to Copenhagen in September 1912. The following September she visited Isle of Portland Portland, Cherbourg, and Stavanger together with her sister ship, ship  Russian battleship Imperator Pavel I  2. She ran aground on Odensholm Island, off the Estonian coast, on 1 July 1914. The ship was still under repair when World War I began the following month. Her lattice masts were cut down and light topmasts were added while under repair.McLaughlin, pp. 188, 302

Andrei Pervozvanny was mostly inactive during the war as the Russian naval strategy in the Baltic was defensive and they did not intend to seek out the German fleet.McLaughlin, p. 188 Torpedo nets were fitted in early 1915 and the ship's torpedoes were removed in January 1916. In late 1916, four convert 76 mm 0 adj=on sp=us Anti-aircraft warfare anti-aircraft guns were added.McLaughlin, p. 302 The ship's crew joined the general mutiny of the Baltic Fleet in Helsinki on 16 March 1917, after they received word of the February Revolution in Saint Petersburg, and several of the ship's officers were murdered by the crew. The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk required the Soviets to evacuate their naval base at Helsinki in March 1918 or have their ships interned by newly independent Finland even though the Gulf of Finland was still frozen over. Andrei Pervozvanny and her sister ship the renamed Respublika, led the second group of ships on 5 April and reached Kronstadt five days later in what became known as the Ice Cruise of the Baltic Fleet Ice Voyage.

After the October Revolution in 1918, the ship remained on active duty as part of the Soviet Navy Red Navy during the Russian Civil War.

She was hit on the port bow and settled convert 2 ft 1 down by the bow. The British claimed three torpedo hits, but two of the torpedoes actually struck the harbor wall behind the battleship. The Victoria Cross, Britain's highest military decoration, was awarded to Commander Claude Congreve Dobson and Lieutenant Gordon Charles Steele for their successful attack.Head, pp. 229, 232 The ship was raised and docked, but never fully repaired.  While under repair, she was nearly hit by a small bomb during a British air raid on 3 September.Head, p. 233  Scrapping of Andrei Pervozvanny began 15 December 1923,Melnikov, p. 96. although she was not formally stricken until 21 November 1925.
