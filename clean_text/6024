The structure of the St John Passion (), BWV 245, a sacred oratorio by Johann Sebastian Bach, is &quot;carefully designed with a great deal of musico-theological intent&quot;. Some main aspects of the structure are shown in tables below.
The original Latin title  translates to &quot;The Passion after John&quot;. Bach's large choral composition in two parts on German text, written to be performed in a Lutheran service on Good Friday, is based on the Passion, as told in two chapters from the Gospel of John ( and ) in the translation by Martin Luther, with two short interpolations from the Gospel of Matthew. During the vespers service, the two parts of the work were performed before and after the sermon. Part I covers the events until Peter's denial of Jesus, Part II concludes with the burial of Jesus. The Bible text is reflected in contemporary poetry and in chorales that often end a &quot;scene&quot; of the narration, similar to the way a chorale ends most Bach cantatas. An anonymous poet supplied a few texts himself, quoted from other Passion texts and inserted chorales by nine hymnwriters. Bach led the first performance on 7 April 1724 in Leipzig's . He repeated it several times between 1724 and 1749, experimenting with different movements and changes to others, which resulted in four versions. The Passion, close to Bach's heart, has an &quot;immediate dramatic quality&quot;.
Structure
Text
Gospel
The gospel account by John narrates the story in five &quot;scenes&quot;. The corresponding movement numbers are given from the  (NBA).
Part I

Arrest (1&lt;U+2013&gt;5), Kidron Valley ()
Denial (6&lt;U+2013&gt;14), palace of the high priest Kaiphas ()

Part II

Court hearing with Pontius Pilate (15&lt;U+2013&gt;26) ( and )
Crucifixion and death (27&lt;U+2013&gt;37), Golgatha ()
Burial (38&lt;U+2013&gt;40), burial site ()

Some musicologists regard movement 24 as the conclusion of scene 3, the aria &quot;&quot; which locates the action from the courthouse to Golgotha, the calvary. Others, including Alfred D&lt;U+00FC&gt;rr regard the scene as ending with the last comment by Pilate.
Bach incorporated two short interpolations from the Gospel of Matthew,  after John 18:27, describing the weeping of Peter, and  after John 19:30, describing the tearing of the temple curtain. The narrator is the Evangelist, a tenor, Jesus and all other male characters are sung by a bass, the people who are often summarily called  (the Jews) are sung by a four-part chorus (SATB) in dramatic  movements. The &quot;immediate, dramatic quality&quot; of the &quot;kind of musical equivalent of the Passion Play&quot; relies on the setting of the interaction between the historical persons (Jesus, Pilate, Peter) and the crowd (&quot;soldiers, priests, and populace&quot;).
Chorales
At eleven points in the structure, chorales reflect the narration, stanzas from Lutheran hymns. Possibly Bach had an influence on their selection. He set them all in common time for four parts, the instruments playing with the voices.
Five chorales conclude a scene (in movements 5, 14, 26, 37 and 40), a chorale opens Part II (15). Five chorales comment within a scene (3, 11, 17, 22, 28). including the central movement of the whole Passion (22). One chorale accompanies the bass soloist in an aria (32).
Most chorale texts were written in the 16th and 17th century, by authors of the Reformation such as Martin Luther, Martin Schalling and Michael Wei&lt;U+00DF&gt;e, and by hymn writers including Paul Gerhardt and Johann Heermann. The central chorale is not part of a common hymn.
Contemporary text
On a third level of text, contemporary poetry reflects the biblical narration. It was compiled by an unknown author, who partly used existing text. From the Brockes Passion (, Hamburg, 1712 and 1715) by Barthold Heinrich Brockes, he copied for movements 7, 19, 20, 24, 32, 34, a part of 35 and 39. He found movement 13 in Christian Weise's  (Leipzig, 1675) and took from Christian Heinrich Postel's  (c. 1700) movements 19 (partly), 22 and 30.

Scoring
The work is scored for vocal soloists, soprano, alto, tenor and bass, a four part choir SATB, and an orchestra of two flauto traverso (Ft), two oboes (Ob), two oboes da caccia (Oc), two violins, viola (Va), and basso continuo. Bach added some instruments in arias for special effects, old-fashioned already at the time, such as lute, viola d'amore and viola da gamba (Vg). Bach did not differentiate the vox Christi (voice of Christ), singing the words of Jesus, from the other bass recitatives and arias, nor the evangelist from the tenor arias.
Symmetry
The work displays a thoughtful symmetry. In the center of the five parts is the court hearing which confronts Jesus, Pilate and the people. In the middle of the hearing, a chorale (22) interrupts the argument, which talks about prison and freedom. It is surrounded by two choral movements, which not only both ask for the crucifixion of Jesus, but also use the same musical motifs, the second time intensified. Again in symmetry of similar musical material, a preceding  choir explains the law, while a corresponding movement reminds Pilate of the emperor whose authority is challenged by someone calling himself a king. Preceding this, Jesus is greeted in mockery as the king, corresponding in motif to the later request that Pilate should change the inscription saying he is the king to that he claimed to be king.
Versions
  Bach led the first performance on 7 April 1724 at the  (St. Nicholas) as part of a Vesper service on Good Friday. Part I was performed before the sermon, Part II after the sermon. Bach performed a second version on Good Friday a year later, 30 March 1725. Other changes date from between 1728 and 1732 (version 3), and between 1738 and 1748 (version 4).
In version 2, Bach opened with a chorale fantasia on &quot;&quot; (O man, bewail thy sins so great), the first stanza of a 1525 hymn by Sebald Heyden, a movement which he ultimately used to conclude Part I of his St Matthew Passion, returning to the previous chorus  in later versions of the St John Passion. He used three alternative arias, one of them with a chorale sung by the choir, and replaced the two closing movements, the chorus &quot;&quot; and the chorale &quot;&quot; with the chorale 'Christe, du Lamm Gottes&quot; (O Christ, Lamb of God thou), the German , published in Braunschweig in 1528. Bach took this movement from his cantata , which had been an audition piece for the Leipzig post.
In version 3, after Bach wrote his St Matthew Passion, he returned the opening chorus  and the final chorus &quot;&quot; to their first position, but eliminated the Gospel passages after Matthew and the closing chorale.
In version 4, Bach returned to the first version, possibly in 1739, but revised it thoroughly. He began a new score which covers 12 movements. As Christoph Wolff observes: &quot;The fragmentary revised score constitutes an extensive stylistic overhaul with painstaking improvements to the part-writing and a partial restructuring of the instrumentation; particular attention was paid to the word-setting in the recitatives and the continuo accompaniment.&quot; In 1749, Bach performed the St John Passion once more, to become his last performance of a Passion.
Wolff writes: &quot;Bach experimented with the St John Passion as he did with no other large-scale composition&quot;, possible by the work's structure with the Gospel text as its backbone and interspersed features that could be exchanged. Wolff concludes: &quot;the work accompanied Bach right from his first year as Kantor of St Thomas's to the penultimate year of his life and thus, for that reason alone, how close it must have been to his heart.
Tables of movements
The following tables give an overview of version I of the Passion, first performed in 1724. Two versions of movement numbers are given, first that of the Neue Bach-Ausgabe (NBA), then that of the older Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis (BWV). Voices appear in one of three columns, depending on the text source, Bible, contemporary poetic reflection, and chorale. The instrumentation is added, using abbreviations for instruments, followed by key and time signature, and the NBA number of a corresponding movement within the work's symmetry.

Overview
In the following, the movement numbers are those of the NBA, version I, unless otherwise noted.
The chorales in detail

Johann Heermann, 1669

The first chorale, movement 3, is inserted after Jesus said to arrest him, but let the disciples go. &quot;&quot; (O mighty love, O love beyond all measure) is stanza 7 of Johann Heermann's 1630 hymn &quot;&quot;. In personal reflection, the speaker sees the contrast of his pleasure in the world and the suffering of Jesus, ending in a short &quot;&quot; (And thou must suffer).

Martin Luther, 1528

The second chorale, movement 5, ends the first scene (of the arrest), after Jesus remarks that he has to be obedient. &quot;&quot; (Thy will be done, Lord God, alike) is stanza 4 of Luther's 1539 hymn &quot;, a paraphrase of the Lord's Prayer.

Paul Gerhardt

The third chorale, movement 11, is inserted after Jesus asks the one who beat him for justification. Two stanzas from Paul Gerhardt's 1647 hymn &quot;&quot; comment the scene, stanza 3, &quot;&quot; (Who hath thee now so stricken), and stanza 4, &quot;&quot; (I, I and my transgressions), highlighting the personal responsibility of the speaking sinner for the suffering of Jesus.
The fourth chorale, movement 14, ends the second scene (of the arrest) and Part I. After the denial of Peter, &quot;&quot; (Peter, when he fails to think) summarizes the scene in stanza 10 of Paul Stockmann's 1633 hymn &quot;&quot;.
The fifth chorale, movement 15, opens Part II and the third scene (of the court hearing). &quot;&quot; (Christ, who hath us blessed made), stanza 1 of Michael Wei&lt;U+00DF&gt;e's 1531 hymn, summarizes what Jesus has to endure although innocent (&quot;made captive, ... falsely indicted, and mocked and scorned and bespat&quot;).
The sixth chorale, movement 17, comments in two more stanzas from &quot;Herzliebster Jesu&quot; (3), after Jesus addressed the different kind of his kingdom. Stanza 8, &quot;&quot; (Ah King so mighty, mighty in all ages) reflects the kingdom and the need for thanksgiving, stanza 9 the inability to grasp it, &quot;&quot; (I cannot with my reason ever fathom).
The seventh chorale, movement 22, is the central movement of the whole Passion, which interrupts the conversation of Pilate and the crowd by a general statement of the importance of the passion for salvation: &quot;&quot; (Through this thy prison, Son of God, must come to us our freedom) is not part of a known hymn, but the text of an aria from a St John Passion by Postel from c. 1700.
The seventh chorale, movement 26, ends the scene of the court hearing, after Pilate refuses to change the inscription. &quot;&quot; (Within my heart's foundation) is stanza 3 of Valerius Herberger's 1613 hymn &quot;&quot;.
The eighth chorale, movement 28, is related to Jesus telling his mother and John to take care of each other. &quot;&quot; (He of all did well take heed) is stanza 20 of Stockmann's hymn (14).
The ninth chorale, movement 32, is part of the bass aria which follows immediately after the report of the death of Jesus. &quot;&quot; (Jesus, thou who suffered death, livest now forever) is the final stanza of Stockmann's hymn (14).
The tenth chorale, movement 37, ends the scene of the crucifixion. &quot;&quot; (O help, Christ, O Son of God) is stanza 8 of Wei&lt;U+00DF&gt;e's hymn (15).
The eleventh chorale, movement 40, ends the Passion. &quot;&quot; (Ah Lord, let thine own angels dear) is stanza 3 of Martin Schalling's 1569 hymn &quot;&quot;.
