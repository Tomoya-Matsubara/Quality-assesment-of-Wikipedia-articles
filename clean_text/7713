On March 19, 2009, the Horizon-1 was harassed on its way from Ukraine to China in the Gulf of Aden by Somali pirates as she witnessed the hijacking of the Greek-owned vessel MV Titan. The captain alarmed the naval forces, which were patrolling in the area. The attack on Horizon-1 was prevented by the appearence of the naval forces.

In the morning of July 9, 2009 at 08:29 EEST 05:29 UTC, the Horizon-1 was attacked again in the Gulf of Aden and hijacked by five armed pirates. She was carrying 33,000 tons of dry sulfur from Saudi Arabia to Jordan.r0710/  As reported by the Turkish Navy, the vessel was brought first to the Somalia Somali port of Hordio, where she moored on July 9 at around 09:00 EEST 6:00 UTC. Turkish frigates TCG Gaziantep F 490 TCG Gaziantep and TCG Gediz F 495 TCG Gediz stood by in the vicinity.cite web  url=http://www.denizcilik.gov.tr/denizkaza/list.asp?SIRANO=1159  publisher=Undersecretary of Maritime, Search and Rescue Coordination Center  title=Horizon-1  accessdate=2009-07-19  On July 10, the Horizon-1 left Hordio and sailed to the so-called pirate haven of Eyl in convert 60 nmi km mi abbr=on distance southwards, cruising at low speed for unknown reason.cite news  url=http://www.cumhuriyet.com.tr/?im=yhs&hn=68020  publisher=Cumhuriyet  title=Horizon-1 baka bir limana gtrlyor  date=2009-07-10  accessdate=2009-07-19  language=Turkish 

At the time of the incident, the vessel's crew consisted of 23 Turks including the 24-year old, female third mate third officer Aysun Akbay, a graduate of Black Sea Technical University's Department of Deck at Srmene Faculty of Marine Sciences.

While the ship's owner gave permission to the Turkish Navy for freeing the vessel and her crew by forced intervention, the Turkish government rejected this option due to lack of procedures in case of getting hold of the pirates. The Turkish officials rather preferred to contact Kenyan authorities for legal assistance, who have more experience in handling pirates from Somalia.r0710/
