Horseshoe Curve is a , triple-tracked, railroad curve on the Norfolk Southern Railway's Pittsburgh Line in Logan Township, Blair County in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania. It is close to  in diameter and has a grade of almost 2 percent. As a train travels west from Altoona, it ascends almost  in the  segment that makes up the curve and rotates 220 degrees.
The curve was completed in 1854 by the Pennsylvania Railroad as a means of lessening the grade to the summit of the Allegheny Mountains by increasing the distance. It was built as alternative to the time-consuming Allegheny Portage Railroad, the only other method of traversing the mountains. It has formed an important part of the region's transport infrastructure since its opening, and during World War II was targeted by Nazi Germany in 1942 as a part of Operation Pastorius. The curve was later owned and used by the Pennsylvania Railroad's successors—Penn Central, Conrail, and Norfolk Southern. Horseshoe Curve was added to the National Register of Historic Places and designated a National Historic Landmark in 1966. It was also designated a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark in 2004.
Since its opening, Horseshoe Curve has been a tourist attraction. A trackside observation park for visitor's was completed in 1879. The park was renovated and a visitor's center constructed in the early 1990s. The center is managed by Railroaders Memorial Museum in Altoona and contains exhibits pertaining to the curve.
Location and design
Horseshoe Curve is a  segment of the Pittsburgh Line, the Norfolk Southern Railway's main east–west route in its Pittsburgh Division between Pittsburgh and Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.1 Trains heading west from Altoona have to ascend a maximum grade of 1.85 percent for  to the summit of the Allegheny Mountains in Gallitzin.2 From there, trains traverse the Gallitzin Tunnels and descend for , at a maximum grade of 1.05 percent, into Johnstown.3
The curve is located  west of Altoona in Logan Township, Blair County at railroad milepost 242. The Blair County Veterans Memorial Highway (SR 4008) parallels the valley west from Altoona and crosses under the curve via a tunnel.4 Within the open eastern end of Horseshoe Curve is a dam and lake, the highest of a series of three reservoirs along the valley which are owned by the Altoona Water Authority and supply water to the city.5 Horseshoe Curve spans two ravines formed by creeks: Kittanning Run on the northern side, and Glenwhite Run on the southern.67  For every , the tracks at Horseshoe Curve bend 9 degrees and 15 minutes with the entire curve totaling 220 degrees.89 At its widest, the curve is approximately  across.10 Horseshoe Curve descends from an elevation of  on the southern side to  on the northern with a grade of 1.73 percent.1112 Three sets of , continuous welded railroad tracks make up the curve.13 Prior to dieselization and the introduction of dynamic braking, the rails along the curve would be transposed—left to right and vice versa—to equalize the amount of wear on one side of the rail from the flanges of passing steam locomotives and rail cars, thereby extending its lifespan.14
History
In 1834, the state of Pennsylvania constructed the Allegheny Portage Railroad across the Allegheny Mountains to connect Philadelphia and Pittsburgh.15 The Portage Railroad consisted of a series of canals and inclined planes and remained in use until the mid-19th century. The Pennsylvania Railroad was incorporated in 1847 and was tasked with building a railroad from Harrisburg to Pittsburgh, bypassing the cumbersome Portage Railroad.16
Construction and use
 Using surveys done several years earlier, the state's engineers recommended a route west from Lewistown that followed the ridges, keeping the maximum grade over the entire  line at 0.852 percent.17 The Chief Engineer for the Pennsylvania Railroad John Edgar Thomson, however, opted to construct a line from Lewistown following lower, flatter terrain along the Juniata River and having the steep grades only on a  stretch of track west of Altoona. It was discovered that the valley west of Altoona was split into two ravines by a mountain. Surveys done east from Gallitzin had already determined a suitable route on the opposite side of the valley that would keep the grade manageable. Traversing the valley using a bridge would have created a grade of 4.37 percent, which was too steep for most trains. To reduce the grade by increasing the distance between the points by using a curve, engineers constructed an earth fill over the first ravine encountered while ascending, formed by Kittanning Run, cut the point of the mountain between the ravines, and filled in the second ravine, formed by Glenwhite Run.18
Work on Horseshoe Curve began in 1850 and took over three years to complete.19 The construction was done any without heavy equipment; only men &quot;with picks and shovels, horses and drags&quot; were used.20 The entire line, including Horseshoe Curve, was opened on February 15, 1854. The total cost to lay the  of track between Altoona and Johnstown was $2,495,000 or equivalent to $80,225 per mile ($49,850 /km).21 The remaining part of the mountain inside the curve was leveled in 1879 to allow for the construction of a park and observation area—the first specifically built for viewing trains.22 As the demand for train travel increased, a third set of tracks was added to the curve in 1898 and a fourth was added two years later to relieve congestion.2324
From around the 1860s to just before World War II, Horseshoe Curve was served by the Kittanning Point station.2526 Two branch railroads connected to the main line at Horseshoe Curve in the early-20th century; both the Kittanning Run Railroad and the railroad owned by the Glen White Coal and Lumber Company followed their respective creeks to nearby coal mines.27 The Pennsylvania Railroad delivered empty hopper cars to the Kittanning Point station which the two railroads returned loaded with coal.28 Across from the station, a spur track on the hillside supplied a coal trestle, where trains could take on fuel and water during the early 1900s.29 A reservoir was constructed at the apex of Horseshoe Curve in 1887 for the city of Altoona; a second reservoir, below the first, was finished in 1896.30 The third reservoir, Lake Altoona, was completed by 1913.31 A macadam road to the curve was opened in 1932 allowing access for visitors, and a gift shop was constructed in 1940.32
Horseshoe Curve was a major selling point for the Pennsylvania Railroad. The curve was depicted in brochures, calendars and other promotional material; Pennsylvania Railroad stock certificates were also printed with a vignette of it.33 The Pennsylvania pitted the scenery of Horseshoe Curve against rival New York Central Railroad's &quot;Water Level Route&quot; during the 1890s.34 A raised-relief, scale model of the curve was included as part of the Pennsylvania Railroad's exhibit at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago.35 All Pennsylvania Railroad conductors were required to announce Horseshoe Curve to daytime passengers—a tradition that continues aboard Amtrak trains.36 The Pennsylvania also went to great lengths to prevent the passengers' views of the curve from being obstructed by passing freight trains.37

World War II and post-war
During World War II, Horseshoe Curve was used to transport troops and material for the Allied war effort, and was placed under armed guard.3839 The military intelligence arm of Nazi Germany, the Abwehr, plotted to sabotage important industrial assets in the United States in a project code-named Operation Pastorius.40 In June 1942, four men were brought by submarine and landed on the coast of Long Island. They were tasked with destroying such sites as the curve, the Hell Gate Bridge, Alcoa aluminum factories and the locks on the Ohio River.41 The would-be saboteurs were eventually apprehended by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) after one, George John Dasch, turned himself in.42
 As part of the celebrations in 1954 for the centennial of the opening of Horseshoe Curve, a night photo was arranged by Sylvania Electric Products using 6,000 flashbulbs and  of wiring to illuminate the curve.43 The stunt also commemorated the 75th anniversary of the incandescent light bulb. The Pennsylvania steam locomotive 1361 was placed at the park inside the Horseshoe Curve on June 8, 1957.44 The locomotive, a K4s-class, was one of the principal locomotive types used by the Pennsylvania Railroad and that regularly plied the curve.45 Horseshoe Curve was listed on the National Register of Historic Places and was designated a National Historic Landmark on November 13, 1966.4647 The operation of the observation park was transferred to the city of Altoona the same year.48 The Pennsylvania Railroad was combined with the New York Central Railroad in 1968. The merger created Penn Central, which went bankrupt and was taken over by the federal government in 1976 to become Conrail. The second track from the inside at Horseshoe Curve was removed by Conrail in 1981.49 The K4s 1361 was removed from the curve for a restoration to working order in September 1985 and was replaced with the ex-Conrail EMD GP9 diesel-electric locomotive 7048 that was repainted into a Pennsylvania Railroad scheme.50
Starting in June 1990, the park at Horseshoe Curve underwent a $5.8 million renovation funded by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation and by the National Park Service through its &quot;America's Industrial Heritage Project&quot;.51 The renovations were completed in April 1992 with the dedication of a new visitor's center.52 In 1999, the trackage owned by Conrail was divided between CSX Transportation and Norfolk Southern with Horseshoe Curve being acquired by the latter. Horseshoe Curve was lit up again with fireworks and rail-born searchlights during its sesquicentennial in 2004 as an homage to the celebrations in 1954.5354 It was designated a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Civil Engineers in 2004.55
Current operations
Traffic on Horseshoe Curve reached its peak in the 1940s with over 50 passenger trains per day along with many freight and military trains.56 Demand for train travel dropped greatly through the post-World War II years as highway and air travel became increasingly popular.57 The curve still is, however, busy as part of Norfolk Southern's Pittsburgh Line and, , is traversed by 51 scheduled freight trains every day, not including locals and the movements of helper engines which can double the number.58 The , EMD SD40-2 and SD40E helpers are coupled to the rear of long trains, providing the additional power necessary to ascend to the summit and assisting in braking during the descent.596061 Amtrak's Pennsylvanian rounds the curve once in each direction daily on its journey between Pittsburgh and New York City.
The Railroaders Memorial Museum in Altoona manages a visitor's center at the base of the curve which is open annually from April to October.62 The  center contains various historical artifacts and memorabilia relating to the curve, as well as a raised-relief map of the Altoona–Johnstown area.63 Access to the curve is enabled by either a  funicular or a 194-step stairway, the equivalent of a 10-story building.6465 The funicular is single-tracked, with the cars passing each other halfway up the slope; the cars are painted to resemble Pennsylvania Railroad passenger cars.66 In addition to the locomotive on display, a former &quot;watchman's shanty&quot; is located in the park.67 Horseshoe Curve is popular with railfans; train watchers can sometimes see three trains traversing the curve at the same time.6869
