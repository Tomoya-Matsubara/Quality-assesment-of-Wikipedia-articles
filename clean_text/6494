Usos y costumbres () is a legal term denoting indigenous customary law in Latin America. Since the era of Spanish colonialism, authorities have recognized local forms of rulership, self governance, and juridical practice, with varying degrees of acceptance and formality. The term is often used in English without translation.
Usos y costumbres political mechanisms are used by numerous indigenous peoples in Mexico, Guatemala, Bolivia, and other countries to govern water rights, in criminal and civil conflicts, to elect their representatives to regional and national bodies.
Under Spanish colonial rule
Spanish colonial authorities in the Americas were ordered to investigate the traditions and customs of indigenous communities, and to apply these traditions to disputes among Indian subjects.1 Scholar Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; Rabasa traces the term usos y costumbres to the New Laws of 1542, which ordered traditional procedures be used in dealings with Indians rather than &quot;ordinary&quot; Spanish legal proceedings. The division of legal authority is associated with notion of a Republic of Indians () subject to distinct legal norms under Spanish colonial rule.2 According to Rabasa, this division &quot;at once protects Indian communities from Spaniards, criollos, and mestizos, and alienates Indians in a separate republic, in a structure not unlike apartheid.&quot;3
North America
Mexico
In Mexico, usos y costumbres practices are widely used by indigenous communities and are officially recognized in the following Mexican states: Oaxaca (for 412 of 570 municipalities), Sonora (for the Yaqui reservation), and Chiapas.4
Central America
Guatemala
In Guatemala, Maya communities have used a variety of community-oriented or informal mechanisms for conflict resolution, and is commonly referred to as Maya justice or usos y costumbres.5
South America
Bolivia
In Bolivia, indigenous norms for self-governance, justice, and administration of territory are extensively recognized by the 2009 Constitution, which defines the country as plurinational. This recognition builds on earlier incorporation of indigenous customary law into the Bolivian legal system. In eight of the country's nine departments, minority indigenous peoples (and in La Paz, Afro-Bolivians) elect representatives to the Departmental Assembly through customary procedures.6
Native Community Lands (; TCOs), as recognized by the 1994 Constitutional reform, are indigenous territories whose governance is determined by usos y costumbres.7 , TCOs are being included under the Indigenous Originary Campesino Autonomy regime. The eleven municipalities also under this regime may choose to use usos y costumbres for their internal governance.8 Indigenous water rights, governed by usos y costumbres, were recognized by amendments to Bolivia's Law 2029 following the 2000 Water War.9
Colombia
In Colombia, the 1991 Constitution recognizes locally elected cabildos, chosen through usos y costumbres, as the governing authorities of indigenous reserves () and the validity of customary law in these territories.10
