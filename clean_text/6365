 Old Town is a village on St Mary's in the Isles of Scilly located southeast of Hugh Town.1 It is thought to be the oldest settlement on the island. There is a church, an pub (the Old Town Inn),2 two cafes, a small convenience shop and a day nursery.
It is a popular tourist area and is only a short distance from the island's airport. As well as a number of self-catering holiday properties, Old Town also has a large proportion of dwellings permanently occupied by local residents.
Old Town Bay links the village with the open sea; the Gilstone, a prominent rock off Old Town Bay, should not be confused with a rock of the same name in the Western Rocks.
Ennor Castle
On a small but prominent knoll are the fragmentary remains of a small shell keep castle dating from the thirteenth or fourteenth century, known as Ennor Castle, the only medieval castle on the islands.3 It became redundant after Star Castle was built in the late sixteenth century, and much of its stone was then robbed for buildings in Old Town.4
Church

View of Old Town and the bay from the terraced churchyard; it is the resting place of many of those who have died in nearby shipwrecks.

On the other side of the bay to the settlement lies St Mary's Old Church (commonly known as Old Town Church) which is surrounded by the cemetery for St Mary's.
Notable residents
The late Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Harold Wilson was a resident of Old Town and is now buried in the cemetery at the church.5
