Reception
Critical reception
The song received positive reviews from critics. Judy Coleman of The Boston Globe called &quot;Get Back&quot; a &quot;welcome girl-rock hit&quot;.16 Ed Masley of The Arizona Republic included the song at number eight on his &quot;Top 10 from the Disney girls&quot; list, and said, &quot;She wrote this with the Jonas Brothers, but it sounds more like a Tommy Tutone B-side from the early '80s or the sort of thing Greg Kihn was pining for when he sang, 'They don't write 'em like that anymore'&quot;.17 Masley noted that the song sounds better live, as does &quot;nearly everything Lovato touches&quot;. Masley concluded, writing, &quot;When she sings 'I want to get back to the old days,' what she means is when she and her boyfriend were happy, but power-pop fans will hear it as a call to get back to much older days than that.&quot;18 Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic noted it as one of the best tracks on Don't Forget.19 Joey Guerra of The Houston Chronicle called it &quot;undeniably kicky, and Lovato manages some surprisingly credible rock wails.&quot;20 Ken Barnes of USA Today called it an &quot;insidious, Go-Go's-like single&quot;.21
