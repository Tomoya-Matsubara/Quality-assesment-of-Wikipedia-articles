Home Brew is a New Zealand hip hop album with heavy jazz influences. It features keyboard instruments, horns, saxophones, guitars and bass. It is divided into two discs: Light and Dark.

Dark includes &quot;State of Mind&quot;, on which band member Tom Scott reflects on his father's time in prison, and &quot;The Truth is Ugly&quot;, where he discusses his shortcomings in past romantic relationships. &quot;Listen to Us&quot; criticises the government.12 Thirty-three songs were recorded for the album; twenty-one made the final cut.3
