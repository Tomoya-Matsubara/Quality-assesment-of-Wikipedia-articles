Sale el Sol () is the ninth studio album by Colombian singer-songwriter Shakira, released on October 19, 2010, by Epic Records. The album marks a musical return to Shakira's &quot;roots&quot; after the electropop record She Wolf (2009).1 The singer split the album into three &quot;directions&quot;: a romantic side, a &quot;rock and roll&quot; side, and a &quot;Latino, tropical&quot; side.2 The latter two &quot;directions&quot; experiment with rock and merengue music, respectively. As co-producer, Shakira enlisted collaborators including Josh Abraham, El Cata, Gustavo Cerati, John Hill, Lester Mendez, and Residente Calle 13.
Five singles were released from Sale el Sol. The lead single &quot;Loca&quot; was a worldwide success and topped the charts of numerous countries including Italy, Spain, and Switzerland. The title track was released as the second single and was a moderate success, performing well in Spain. The third single &quot;Rabiosa&quot; reached top ten positions in Austria, Belgium, Italy and Spain. &quot;Antes de las Seis&quot; was released as the fourth single and did not achieve the international chart success of the previous singles. &quot;Addicted to You&quot; was released as the fifth and final single from Sale el Sol and was successful in Mexico and Poland. All five singles released from the album became hits on the Latin record charts in the United States, with &quot;Loca&quot; topping all three of the Billboard Hot Latin Songs, Latin Pop Airplay, and Tropical Songs charts. Shakira embarked on The Sun Comes Out World Tour in late-2010 to promote the album.
Upon its release, Sale el Sol was met with critical acclaim by music critics, many of whom specifically enjoyed the merengue-influenced production of the album. At the 2011 Latin Grammy Awards ceremony, Sale el Sol won the award for &quot;Best Female Pop Vocal Album&quot;. A worldwide commercial success, Sale el Sol peaked atop the charts of countries Belgium, Croatia, France, Mexico, Portugal and Spain. In the United States, it debuted at number seven on the US Billboard 200 chart and at number one on both the Top Latin Albums and Latin Pop Albums charts, achieving strong digital sales in the region. Sale el Sol attained numerous record certifications in several regions across the globe, including multi-platinum certifications in Spain and Switzerland, and diamond certifications in France and Colombia. The album has reportedly sold over four million copies worldwide.
Background
In October 2009, Shakira released her eighth studio album, She Wolf. The composition of the record shifted from her more traditional Latin pop and pop rock styles, and was primarily an electropop album with combined elements of world and dancehall.345 The album was positively received by most music critics and was praised for its distinguished nature and Shakira's experimentation with electropop.6 Commercially, She Wolf was a success and topped charts and attained gold and platinum certifications in several South American and European territories. However, it performed poorly in the United States and became Shakira's first studio album since D&lt;U+00F3&gt;nde Est&lt;U+00E1&gt;n los Ladrones? (1998) to miss peaking inside the top 10 after it debuted at number 15 on the US Billboard Hot 200 chart.7 In May 2010, she wrote and recorded &quot;Waka Waka (This Time for Africa)&quot;, the official anthem song of the 2010 FIFA World Cup, which became a worldwide hit.8
Production

Following the worldwide success of &quot;Waka Waka (This Time for Africa)&quot;, Shakira soon began work on her ninth studio album Sale el Sol. She decided to experiment with merengue music on the album, saying &quot;I grew up listening to merengue&lt;U+2014&gt;that was a big part of my life, and I was missing it.&quot;9 Merengue is recognized as the national music of the Dominican Republic10 and the singer travelled to the country to work with Dominican songwriter and record producer El Cata, resulting in songs like &quot;Loca&quot; and &quot;Rabiosa&quot;. Shakira said that the recording of the two songs took place in &quot;this tiny studio in the middle of nowhere&quot;, and that &quot;it wasn't planned, I was just following my instincts. So this album is very genuine, and very personal as well&quot;.11 Other collaborators on the album include American rapper and songwriter Armando P&lt;U+00E9&gt;rez, better known by his stage name Pitbull, Shakira's friend and frequent collaborator Luis Fernando Ochoa, Ren&lt;U+00E9&gt; P&lt;U+00E9&gt;rez Joglar, better known by his stage name &quot;Residente Calle 13&quot;, John Hill, Lester Mendez, Albert Men&lt;U+00E9&gt;ndez, Tim Mitchell and Jorge Drexler.1213 Shakira co-wrote and co-produced every track on the album, with the exception of &quot;Islands&quot;.14 The recording of the album took place at locations such as The Bahamas, London, Barcelona and the Dominican Republic.15
Armando P&lt;U+00E9&gt;rez, who co-wrote the tracks &quot;Loca&quot; and &quot;Rabiosa&quot;, talked about Shakira's previous album She Wolf, saying &quot;on the last album they tried to Americanize Shakira by giving her the big producers. Not that it was necessarily a bad thing, but it&lt;U+2019&gt;s just not her&quot;.16 Talking about his collaboration with Shakira, El Cata revealed that she told him &quot;You have something that makes me move&quot;.17 Cata responded by telling Shakira that &quot;it was the percussion&quot; and &quot;Those sounds that you want, I have them in my studio.&quot;, which led to a recording session between the two.18 He appears as a featured artist on the Spanish version of &quot;Loca&quot;.19 Ren&lt;U+00E9&gt; P&lt;U+00E9&gt;rez Joglar, who performs as the lead singer of Puerto Rican alternative hip hop band under the name of Residente, appears as a featured artist on the track &quot;Gordita&quot;.20 He explained the conception of the song, in which he raps about the fact that &quot;he liked Shakira better when &lt;U+2014&gt; early in her career: she was chubbier, had dark hair and was a rock chick&quot;, by saying that &quot;I told her (Shakira) it was a good idea to make fun of yourself. That way the haters can't say anything, because you already said it&quot;.21 British rapper Dizzee Rascal appears as a featured artist on the English version of &quot;Loca&quot;. He said that he felt &quot;honoured&quot; that Shakira chose him for the song, by saying that &quot;She's a bit of a trendsetter -- she does loads of different things on a major scale. You'd expect her to use an American rapper (for the song), but she chose me. It meant a lot&quot;.22
Musical styles and lyrics

Sale el Sol is considered to be Shakira's return to her &quot;roots&quot; and is a &quot;fusion between rock and pop heavily influenced from Latino and Colombian music&quot;.23 Shakira said there are three &quot;directions&quot; of Sale el Sol: a romantic one, a &quot;very rock and roll&quot; one, and a &quot;Latino, tropical&quot; one.24 Explaining the romantic &quot;direction&quot; of the album, she said that it was something &quot;which I hadn't tapped into for the past three years, but it suddenly came to me and I couldn't hold it back. So it&lt;U+2019&gt;s [the album has] got songs that are very intense, very romantic &quot;.25 Examples include ballads like &quot;Antes de las Seis&quot; (&quot;Before Six O'Clock&quot;) and &quot;Lo Que Mas&quot; (&quot;The Most&quot;);26 in the former Shakira delivers &quot;sad, emotional, and heartfelt vocals,&quot;27 while in the latter she sings over a piano and string-supplemented melody.28 About the rock and roll &quot;direction&quot; of the album, Shakira said &quot;I started my career as a rock artist and then I kind of crossed over into pop, so it&lt;U+2019&gt;s been fun to re-encounter that side of my artistic personality&quot;.29 The title track is an acoustic guitar-driven alternative rock and Latin pop-infused song,3031 while &quot;Devoci&lt;U+00F3&gt;n&quot; (&quot;Devotion&quot;) is a techno-influenced alternative rock track in which Shakira &quot;beats all U2-inspired arena rockers at their own game,&quot; according to AllMusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine.323334 The &quot;sultry, energetic, bass-laden&quot; &quot;Tu Boca&quot; (&quot;Your Mouth&quot;) finds influences from new wave music.3536 &quot;Islands&quot; is a cover of the original song of the same name by English indie pop band The xx.37 Shakira adds a few house music elements to the original art pop song.3839

The &quot;Latino&quot; and tropical side of the album is prominently influenced by merengue music.40 The genre is characterized by the use of the accordion and the percussion instrument tambora.41 &quot;Loca&quot; (&quot;Crazy&quot;), is Shakira's interpretation of El Cata's song &quot;Loca Con Su Tiguere&quot;, and is composed of horn-heavy merengue beats set over techno dance percussion beats.42 Similarly, &quot;Rabiosa&quot; (&quot;Rabid&quot;) is Shakira's interpretation of El Cata's song &quot;La Rabiosa&quot;, and is a fast-paced merengue-influenced dance track.43 In addition to merengue, songs like &quot;Addicted to You&quot;, which features &quot;bilingual lyrics, a very 70's chorus and Copacabana sounds&quot;,44 are influenced by reggaeton music.45 &quot;Gordita&quot; (&quot;Chubby&quot;), a duet between Residente Calle 13 and Shakira, is a cumbia and Latin rap hybrid.46
Talking about the album's lyrical content, Shakira said that there are some songs &quot;that are just to dance to in a club, that don&lt;U+2019&gt;t have a big transcendence&quot;.47 In &quot;Rabiosa&quot;, Shakira sings about her partner's sex appeal.48 &quot;Loca&quot; expresses Shakira's erratic and obsessive behaviour towards her lover, more so than his other leading lady. However, Shakira also said that there are some songs which &quot;will remain in people&lt;U+2019&gt;s hearts and people&lt;U+2019&gt;s consciousness, sometimes forever&quot;.49 She described these tracks as &quot;songs that have the power to feed people&lt;U+2019&gt;s relationships and states of mind and states of spirit&quot;.50 According to Billboard, the title track is composed of &quot;evocative and hopeful&quot; lyrics which are dedicated to Argentine singer-songwriter and Shakira's friend Gustavo Cerati, who had been in a coma around the time of the release of the album.51 &quot;Antes de las Seis&quot; deals with issues of longing, regrets and loneliness.52 Shakira said these songs are written &quot;in such a personal and intimate way that at that moment. I'm not really thinking much. I'm just letting it all out&quot;.53
