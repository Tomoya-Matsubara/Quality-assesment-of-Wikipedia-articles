Stanley Finlay Thomas &quot;Stan&quot; Clements, (born Portsmouth 25 June 1923) is a retired footballer who played most of his professional career for Southampton.
He was formerly a mechanical engineer in Portsmouth's naval dockyards, and joined Southampton from Gosport Borough in July 1944.
He made his league debut on 24 May 1947 in the 2-0 home victory over Fulham. He was a strong, powerful centre-half and replaced Eric Webber for 13 games in the following season when Webber was rested. Once Webber regained his place in the team, Clements made no further first-team appearances until February 1951. For the following few seasons he alternated at centre-back with Len Wilkins and Henry Horton and had a spell as team captain in 1952-53.
He scored once in 116 league games before becoming player-coach at Basingstoke Town in February 1955.
After leaving football, he qualified as a civil engineer and worked in Kenya, Uganda and Sudan, before briefly helping to coach the Kenyan national team.
He returned to the UK in the mid-1980s and now lives in Gosport.1
