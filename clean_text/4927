Ion Victor Antonescu (June 15, 1882 &lt;U+2013&gt; June 1, 1946) was a Romanian soldier, authoritarian politician and convicted war criminal. The Prime Minister and Conduc&lt;U+0103&gt;tor during most of World War II, he presided over two successive wartime dictatorships. A Romanian Army career officer who made his name during the 1907 peasants' revolt and the World War I Romanian Campaign, the antisemitic Antonescu sympathized with the far right and fascist National Christian and Iron Guard groups for much of the interwar period. A military attach&lt;U+00E9&gt; to France and later Chief of the General Staff, he briefly served as Defense Minister in the National Christian cabinet of Octavian Goga. During the late 1930s, his political stance brought him into conflict with King Carol II and led to his detainment. Antonescu nevertheless rose to political prominence during the political crisis of 1940, and established the National Legionary State, an uneasy partnership with the Iron Guard's leader Horia Sima. After entering Romania into an alliance with Nazi Germany and the Axis and ensuring Adolf Hitler's confidence, he eliminated the Guard during the Legionary Rebellion of 1941. In addition to leadership of the executive, he assumed the offices of Foreign Affairs and Defense Minister. Soon after Romania joined the Axis in Operation Barbarossa, recovering Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina, Antonescu also became Marshal of Romania.
An atypical figure among Holocaust perpetrators, Antonescu enforced policies independently responsible for the deaths of as many as 400,000 people, most of them Bessarabian, Ukrainian and Romanian Jews, as well as Romani Romanians. The regime's complicity in the Holocaust combined pogroms and mass murders such as the Odessa massacre with ethnic cleansing, systematic deportations to occupied Transnistria and widespread criminal negligence. The system in place was nevertheless characterized by singular inconsistencies, prioritizing plunder over killing, showing leniency toward most Jews in the Old Kingdom, and ultimately refusing to adopt the Final Solution as applied throughout Nazi-occupied Europe.
Confronted with heavy losses on the Eastern Front, Antonescu embarked on inconclusive negotiations with the Allies, just before a political coalition, formed around the young monarch Michael I, toppled him during the August 23, 1944 Coup. After a brief detention in the Soviet Union, the deposed Conduc&lt;U+0103&gt;tor was handed back to Romania, where he was tried by a special People's Tribunal and executed. This was part of a series of trials, which also passed sentences on his various associates, as well as his wife Maria. The judicial procedures earned much criticism for responding to the Romanian Communist Party's ideological priorities, a matter which fueled nationalist and far right attempts to have Antonescu posthumously exonerated. While these groups elevated Antonescu to the status of hero, his involvement in the Holocaust was officially reasserted and condemned following the 2003 Wiesel Commission report.
Biography
Early life and career
Born in Pite&lt;U+015F&gt;ti town, north-west of the capital Bucharest, Antonescu was the scion of an upper-middle class Romanian Orthodox family with some military tradition.1 He was especially close to his mother, Li&lt;U+0163&gt;a Baranga, who survived his death.2 His father, an army officer, wanted Ion to follow in his footsteps, and as such, he sent him to attend the Infantry and Cavalry School in Craiova.3 According to one account, Ion Antonescu was briefly colleagues with Wilhelm Filderman, the future Romanian Jewish community activist whose interventions with Conduc&lt;U+0103&gt;tor Antonescu helped save a number of his coreligionists.4 After graduation, in 1904, Antonescu joined the Romanian Army with the rank of Second Lieutenant. He spent the following two years attending courses at the Special Cavalry Section in T&lt;U+00E2&gt;rgovi&lt;U+015F&gt;te.5 Reportedly, he was a zealous and goal-setting student, upset by the slow pace of promotions, and compensating for his diminutive stature through toughness.6 In time, the reputation of being a tough and ruthless commander, together with his reddish hair earned him the nickname C&lt;U+00E2&gt;inele Ro&lt;U+015F&gt;u (&quot;The Red Dog&quot;).7 Antonescu also developed a reputation for questioning his commanders, and for appealing to higher instances whenever he felt they were wrong.8
During the repression of the 1907 peasants' revolt, he was the head of a cavalry unit in Covurlui County.910 Opinions on his role in the events diverge: while some historians believe Antonescu was a particularly violent participant in the quelling,1112 others equate his participation with that of regular officers13 or view it as outstandingly tactful.14 In addition to restricting peasant protests, Antonescu's unit subdued socialist activities in Gala&lt;U+0163&gt;i port.15 His handling of the situation earned him praise from King Carol I, who sent Crown Prince (future monarch) Ferdinand to congratulate him in front of the whole garrison.16 The following year, Antonescu was promoted to Lieutenant, and, between 1911 and 1913, he attended the Advanced War School, receiving the rank of Captain upon graduation.17 In 1913, during the Second Balkan War against Bulgaria, Antonescu served as a staff officer in the First Cavalry Division in Dobruja.18
World War I
After 1916, when the Kingdom of Romania entered World War I on the Entente side, Ion Antonescu acted as chief of staff for General Constantin Prezan.19 In August 1916, upon the start of the Romanian campaign, Romanian troops crossed the Carpathian Mountains, marching into the Austro-Hungarian-ruled region of Transylvania, but their effort was halted when the Central Powers opened new fronts. Bulgarian and Imperial German armies decisively defeated their ill-equipped and poorly-defended Romanian adversaries in the Battle of Turtucaia (August 24), and advanced into Dobruja. When enemy troops crossed the mountains from Transylvania into Wallachia, Antonescu was ordered to design a defense plan for Bucharest.20
The Romanian royal court, army and administration were subsequently forced to retreat into Moldavia, the last portion of territory still under Romanian control. Henceforth, he partook in any important decision involving defensive efforts, an unusual promotion which probably complimented his ambition.21 In December, as Prezan became the Chief of the General Staff, Antonescu, who was by now a major, was named the head of operations, being involved in the defense of Moldavia. He contributed to the tactics used during the Battle of M&lt;U+0103&gt;r&lt;U+0103&gt;&lt;U+015F&gt;e&lt;U+015F&gt;ti (July-August 1917), when Romanians under General Alexandru Averescu managed to stop the advance of German forces under the command of Field Marshal August von Mackensen.22 Antonescu lived in Prezan's proximity for the remainder of the war, and influenced his decisions.23
That autumn, the October Revolution took place, taking Romania's main ally, the Russian Provisional Government, out of the conflict. Its successor, Bolshevik Russia made peace with the Central Powers by the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, leaving Romania the only enemy of the Central Powers on the Eastern Front. In these conditions, the Romanian government signed, and the Parliament ratified, Romania's own peace treaty with the Central Powers. Romania broke the treaty later in the year, on grounds that King Ferdinand I had not signed it. During the interval, Antonescu, who viewed the separate peace as &quot;the most rational solution&quot;, was assigned command over a cavalry regiment.24 The renewed offensive played a part in ensuring the union of Transylvania with Romania. After the war, Antonescu's merits as an operations officer were noticed by among others, politician Ion G. Duca, who wrote that &quot;his intelligence, skill and activity, brought credit on himself and invaluable service to the country&quot;.25 Another event occurring late in the war is also credited with having played a major part in Antonescu's life: in 1918, Crown Prince Carol (the future King Carol II) eloped and technically deserted his army posting, to marry the commoner Zizi Lambrino.26 This outraged Antonescu, who developed enduring contempt for the royal.27
Diplomatic assignments and General Staff positions
Lieutenant Colonel Ion Antonescu retained his notoriety during the interwar period. He participated in the political campaign to make Romania's gains in Transylvania recognized at the Paris Peace Conference of 1919. His nationalist argument about a future state of the Romanians was published as the essay Rom&lt;U+00E2&gt;nii. Origina , trecutul, sacrificiile &lt;U+015F&gt;i drepturile lor (&quot;The Romanians. Their Origin, Their Past, Their Sacrifices and Their Rights&quot;). The booklet claimed extension of Romanian rule beyond the confines of Greater Romania, and recommended, at the risk of war with the emerging Kingdom of Yugoslavia, the annexation of all Banat areas and the Timok Valley.28 In March 1920, Antonescu was one of three people nominated by the new Averescu executive to be a military attach&lt;U+00E9&gt; of Romania in France, but a report issued by the French military observer in Romania, General Victor P&lt;U+00E9&gt;tin, was negative enough to make the French side choose a certain Colonel &lt;U+015E&gt;u&lt;U+0163&gt;u instead (the text referred to Antonescu as &quot;extremely vain&quot;, &quot;chauvinistic&quot; and &quot;xenophobic&quot;, while acknowledging his &quot;great military worth&quot;).29
Nevertheless, in 1922, &lt;U+015E&gt;u&lt;U+0163&gt;u had to leave Paris, and when the Romanian government nominated Antonescu again, the French government felt obliged to accept his nomination, despite renewed criticism from P&lt;U+00E9&gt;tin's part.30 At the moment of his reassignment, Antonescu was handling military instruction in the Transylvanian city of Sibiu, where his rebellious attitude was causing irritation among his commanders.31 From 1923, Antonescu was also the Romanian attach&lt;U+00E9&gt; in the United Kingdom and Belgium.32 After embarking on his mission, he negotiated a credit worth 100 million French francs to be placed in Romania's purchase of French weaponry, and worked together with Romanian League of Nations diplomat Nicolae Titulescu, whose personal friend he became.33 According to one account, he was also in contact with the Romanian-born conservative aristocrat and writer Marthe Bibesco, who is reported to have introduced Antonescu to the ideas of Gustave Le Bon, a researcher of crowd psychology who had an influence on fascist leaders.34 The same story has it that Bibesco saw the Romanian officer as a new version of 19th century nationalist rebel Georges Boulanger, introducing him as such to Le Bon.35 In 1923, he made the acquaintance of lawyer Mihai Antonescu, who was to become his close friend, legal representative and political associate.36
After returning to Romania in 1926, Antonescu returned to his teaching position in Sibiu, and, in autumn 1928, was Secretary-General of the Defense Ministry in the Vintil&lt;U+0103&gt; Br&lt;U+0103&gt;tianu cabinet.37 He married Maria Niculescu, for long a resident of France, who had been married twice before: to a Romanian Police officer, with whom she had a son, Gheorghe (died 1944), and to Frenchman of Jewish origin.38 After a period as Deputy Chief of the General Staff,39 he was appointed its Chief (1933-1934). These assignments coincided with the rule of Carol's underage son Michael I and his regents, and with Carol's seizure of power in 1930. At the time, Antonescu first grew interested in the Iron Guard, an antisemitic and fascist-related movement headed by Corneliu Zelea Codreanu. In his capacity as Deputy Chief of Staff, he ordered the Army's intelligence unit to compile a report on the faction, and made a series of critical notes on Codreanu's various statements.40
As Chief of Staff, Antonescu reportedly had his first confrontation with the political class and the monarch. His projects for weapon modernization were questioned by Defense Minister Paul Angelescu, leading Antonescu to present his resignation.41 According to another account, he completed an official report on the embezzlement of Army funds, which indirectly implicated Carol and his camarilla (see &lt;U+0160&gt;koda Affair).4243 The king consequently ordered him out of office, provoking indignation among sections of the political mainstream.44 On Carol's orders, Antonescu was placed under surveillance by the Siguran&lt;U+0163&gt;a Statului intelligence service, and closely monitored by the Interior Ministry Undersecretary Armand C&lt;U+0103&gt;linescu.45 The officer's political credentials were on the rise, and he had contacts with all sides of the political spectrum, while support for Carol plummeted. Antonescu maintained contacts with the two main democratic groups, the National Liberal and the National Peasants' parties (known respectively as PNL and PN&lt;U+0162&gt;).46 He was also engaged in discussions with the rising far right, antisemitic and fascist movements: although in competition with each other, both the National Christian Party (PNC) of Octavian Goga and the Iron Guard sought to attract Antonescu to their side.4748 In 1936, to the authorities' alarm, Army General and Iron Guard member Gheorghe Cantacuzino-Gr&lt;U+0103&gt;nicerul arranged a meeting between Ion Antonescu and the movement's leader: Antonescu is reported to have found Codreanu arrogant, but to have welcomed his revolutionizing approach to politics.49
Defense portfolio and the Codreanu trials
In late 1937, after the December general election came to an inconclusive result, Carol appointed Goga Prime Minister over a far right cabinet meant to curb Codreanu's rise, which was also the first executive to impose racial discrimination in its treatment of the Jewish community. Initially designated the Communications portfolio by his former rival, Interior Minister Armand C&lt;U+0103&gt;linescu, Antonescu repeatedly demanded the office of Defense Minister, which he was eventually granted.50 His mandate coincided with a troubled period, and saw Romania having to chose between its traditional alliance with France, Britain, the crumbling Little Entente and the League of Nations or moving closer to Nazi Germany and its Anti-Comintern Pact. Antonescu's own contribution is disputed by historians, who see him as either an Anglo-French alliance supporter or, like the PNC itself, more favorable to cooperation with Adolf Hitler's Germany.51 At the time, Antonescu viewed Romania's alliance with the Entente core as insurance against Hungarian and Soviet revanchism, but, as an anti-communist, he was suspicious of the Franco-Soviet rapprochement.52 Particularly concerned about Hungarian demands in Transylvania, he ordered the General Staff to prepare for a western attack.53 However, his major contribution in office was in relation to an internal crisis: Antonescu extended the already imposed martial law as a response to violent clashes between the Iron Guard and the PNC's own fascist militia, the L&lt;U+0103&gt;ncieri.54
The Goga cabinet ended when the tentative rapprochement between Goga and Codreanu55 prompted Carol to overthrow the democratic system and proclaim his own authoritarian regime (see 1938 Constitution of Romania, National Renaissance Front). The deposed Premier died in 1938, and Antonescu remained close friend of his widow, Veturia Goga.56 By that time, revising his earlier stance, Antonescu had also built a close relationship with Codreanu, and was even said to have become his confidant.5758 On Carol's request, he had earlier asked the Guard's leader to consider an alliance with the king, which Codreanu promptly refused in favor of negotiations with Goga, coupled with claims that he was not interested in political battles (an attitude supposedly induced by Antonescu himself).59
Soon afterward, C&lt;U+0103&gt;linescu, acting on indications from the monarch, arrested Codreanu and prosecuted him in two successive trials. Antonescu, whose mandate of Defense Minister had been prolonged under the premiership of Miron Cristea, resigned in protest to Codreanu's arrest.60 He was a celebrity defense witness at the latter's first61 and second trials.62 During the latter, which saw Codreanu's conviction for treason, Antonescu vouched for his friend's honesty while shaking his hand in front of the jury.63 Upon the end of procedures, the king ordered his former minister interned at Predeal, before assigning him to command the Third Army in the remote eastern region of Bessarabia (and later removing him after Antonescu expressed sympathy for Guardists imprisoned in Chi&lt;U+015F&gt;in&lt;U+0103&gt;u).64 Attempting to discredit his rival, Carol also ordered his wife's trial for bigamy, based on a false claim that her divorce had not been finalized. Defended by Mihai Antonescu, the officer was able to prove his detractors wrong.65 Codreanu himself was taken into custody and discreetly killed by the Gendarmes acting on Carol's orders (November 1938).66
Carol's regime slowly dissolved into crisis, the process being enhanced after the start of World War II, when the military success of the core Axis Powers and the non-aggression pact signed by Germany and the Soviet Union saw Romania isolated and threatened (see Romania during World War II). In 1940, two of Romania's regions, Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina, were lost to a Soviet occupation consented to by the king. This came as Romania, exposed by the Fall of France, was seeking to align its policies with those of Germany.67 Ion Antonescu himself had come to value a pro-Axis alternative after the 1938 Munich Agreement, when Germany imposed demands on Czechoslovakia with the acquiescence of France and the United Kingdom, leaving locals to fear that, unless reoriented, Romania would follow.68 Angered by the territorial losses of 1940, General Antonescu sent Carol a general note of protest, and, as a result, was arrested and interned at Bistri&lt;U+0163&gt;a Monastery.6970 While there, he commissioned Mihai Antonescu to establish contacts with Nazi German officials, promising to advance German economic interest, particularly in respect to the local oil industry, in exchange for endorsement.71 Commenting on Ion Antonescu's ambivalent stance, Hitler's Ambassador to Romania, Wilhelm Fabricius, wrote to his superiors: &quot;I am not convinced that he is a safe man.&quot;72
Rise to power
 His internment ended in August, during which interval Romania had signed off the regions of Southern Dobruja&lt;U+2014&gt;to Bulgaria, and Northern Transylvania&lt;U+2014&gt;under Axis pressures, to Hungary (see Treaty of Craiova, Second Vienna Award). The latter grant caused consternation among large sections of Romania's population, causing Carol's popularity to fall to a record low and provoking large-scale protests in Bucharest. These movements were organized in competition by the pro-Allied PN&lt;U+0162&gt;, headed by Iuliu Maniu, and the pro-Nazi Iron Guard.73 The latter group had been revived under the leadership of Horia Sima, and was organizing a coup d'&lt;U+00E9&gt;tat.74 In this troubled context, Antonescu simply left his assigned residence. He may have been secretly helped in this by German intercession,75 but was more directly aided to escape by socialite Alice Sturdza, who was acting on Maniu's request.76 Antonescu subsequently met with Maniu in Ploie&lt;U+015F&gt;ti, where they discussed how best to manage the political situation.7778 While these negotiations were carried out, the monarch himself was being advised by his entourage to recover legitimacy by governing in tandem with the increasingly popular Antonescu, while creating a new political majority from the existing forces.7980 Carol and Antonescu accepted the proposal, Antonescu being mandated to approach political party leaders Maniu of the PN&lt;U+0162&gt;, Dinu Br&lt;U+0103&gt;tianu of the PNL.8182 They all called for Carol's abdication as a preliminary measure,8384 while Sima, another leader sought after for negotiations, could not be found in time to express his opinion.85 Antonescu partly complied with the request but also asked Carol to bestow upon him the reserve powers for Romanian heads of state.8687 Carol yielded and, on September 5, 1940, the general became Prime Minister with full powers as head of state.8889 The latter's first measure was to curtail potential resistance within the Army by relieving Bucharest Garrison chief Gheorghe Arge&lt;U+015F&gt;anu of his position and replacing him with Dumitru Coroam&lt;U+0103&gt;.90 Shortly afterward, Antonescu heard rumors that two of Carol's loyalist generals, Gheorghe Mihail and Paul Teodorescu, were planning to have him killed.91 In reaction, he imposed formal abdication on the monarch, while General Coroam&lt;U+0103&gt; was refusing to carry out the royal order of shooting down Iron Guardist protesters.92
The king eventually left the throne and Michael I inaugurated his second rule, while Antonescu's effective powers as dictatorial Premier were confirmed and extended.9394 He was formally declared Conduc&lt;U+0103&gt;tor of the state on September 6, by a royal decree which consecrated a ceremonial role for the monarch.95 Among his subsequent measures was ensuring the safe departure into self-exile of Carol and his lover Elena Lupescu, granting protection to the royal train which found itself attacked by armed members of the Iron Guard.96 Horia Sima's subsequent cooperation with Antonescu was endorsed by high-ranking Nazi German officials, many of whom feared the Iron Guard was too weak on its own.97 Antonescu therefore received the approval of Ambassador Fabricius.98 Despite early promises, Antonescu abandoned projects for the creation of a national government,99100 and opted instead for a coalition between a military dictatorship lobby and the Iron Guard.101102 He later justified his choice by stating that the Iron Guard &quot;represented the political base of the country at the time.&quot;103
Antonescu-Sima partnership
The resulting regime, deemed National Legionary State and officially proclaimed on September 14, had Antonescu as Premier and Conduc&lt;U+0103&gt;tor, with Sima as Deputy Premier and leader of the Iron Guard, the latter being remodeled into a single official party.104105106 Antonescu subsequently ordered Carol's Iron Guardist prisoners to be set free.107 On October 6, he presided over the Iron Guard's mass rally in Bucharest, one in a series of major celebratory and commemorative events organized by the movement during the late months of 1940.108 However, he tolerated the PN&lt;U+0162&gt; and PNL's informal existence, allowing them to preserve much of their political support.109
There followed a short-lived and always uneasy partnership between Antonescu and Sima. In late September, the new regime denounced all pacts, accords and diplomatic agreements signed under Carol, bringing the country into Germany's orbit while subverting its relationship with a former Balkan ally, the Kingdom of Yugoslavia.110 Germans troops entered the country in stages, in order to defend the local oil industry111 and help instruct their Romanian counterparts on Blitzkrieg tactics.112 On November 23, Antonescu was in Berlin, where his signature sealed Romania's commitment to the main Axis instrument, the Tripartite Pact.113114 Two days later, the country also adhered to the Nazi-led Anti-Comintern Pact.115 Other than these generic commitments, Romania had no treaty binding it to Germany, and the Romanian-German alliance functioned informally.116 Speaking in 1946, Antonescu claimed to have followed the pro-German path in continuation of earlier policies, and for fear of a Nazi protectorate in Romania.117
During the National Legionary State period, earlier antisemitic legislation was upheld and strengthened, while the &quot;Romanianization&quot; of Jewish-owned enterprises became standard official practice.118119 Immediately after coming into office, Antonescu himself expanded the anti-Jewish and Nuremberg law-inspired legislation passed by his predecessors Goga and Ion Gigurtu,120 while tens of new anti-Jewish regulations were passed in 1941-1942.121 This was done despite his formal pledge to Wilhelm Filderman and the Jewish Communities Federation that, unless engaged in &quot;sabotage&quot;, &quot;the Jewish population will not suffer.&quot;122 Antonescu did not reject the application of Legionary policies, but was offended by Sima's advocacy of paramilitarism and the Guard's frequent recourse to street violence.123124 He arose much hostility from his partners by extending some protection to former dignitaries whom the Iron Guard had arrested.125 One early incident opposed Antonescu to the Guard's magazine Buna Vestire, who accused him of leniency and was subsequently forced to change its editorial board.126 By then, the Legionary press was routinely claiming that he was obstructing revolution and aiming to take control of the Iron Guard, and that he had been transformed into a tool of the Freemasonry (see Anti-Masonry).127 The political conflict coincided with major social challenges, including the influx of refugees from areas lost earlier in the year and the large-scale Bucharest earthquake.128
Disorder peaked in the last days of November 1940, when, after uncovering the circumstances of Codreanu's death, the fascist movement ordered retaliations against political figures previously associated with Carol, carrying out the Jilava Massacre, the assassinations of Nicolae Iorga and Virgil Madgearu, and several other acts of violence.129130 As retaliation for this insubordination, Antonescu ordered the Army to resume control of the streets,131 unsuccessfully pressured Sima to have the assassins detained, ousted the Iron Guardist prefect of Bucharest Police &lt;U+015E&gt;tefan Z&lt;U+0103&gt;voianu, and ordered Legionary ministers to swear an oath to the Conduc&lt;U+0103&gt;tor.132 His condemnation of the killings was nevertheless limited and discreet, and, the same month, he joined Sima at a burial ceremony for Codreanu's newly-discovered remains.133 The widening gap between the dictator and Sima's party resonated in Berlin. When, in December, Legionary Foreign Minister Mihail R. Sturdza obtained the replacement of Fabricius with Manfred Freiherr von Killinger, perceived as more sympathetic to the Iron Guard, Antonescu promptly took over leadership of the ministry, which the compliant diplomat Constantin Greceanu as his right hand.134 In Germany, leaders of the National Socialist Party such as Heinrich Himmler, Baldur von Schirach and Joseph Goebbels135136 threw their support behind the Legionaries, whereas Foreign Affairs Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop and the Wehrmacht stood by Antonescu.137 The latter group was concerned that any internal conflict would threaten Romania's oil industry, vital to the German war effort.138139 The German leadership was by then secretly organizing Operation Barbarossa, the attack on the Soviet Union.140141
Legionary Rebellion and Operation Barbarossa
 Antonescu's plan to act against his coalition partners in the event of further disorder hinged on Hitler's approval,142143144145 a vague signal of which had been given during ceremonies confirming Romania's adherence to the Tripartite Pact.146147 A decisive turn occurred when Hitler invited Antonescu and Sima both over for discussions: whereas Antonescu agreed, Sima stayed behind in Romania, probably plotting a coup d'&lt;U+00E9&gt;tat.148149 While Hitler did not produce a clear endorsement for clamping down on Sima's party, he made remarks interpreted by their recipient as oblique blessings.150
The Antonescu-Sima dispute erupted into violence in January 1941, when the Iron Guard instigated a series of attacks on public institutions and a pogrom, incidents collectively known as the &quot;Legionary Rebellion&quot;.151152 This came after the mysterious assassination of Major D&lt;U+00F6&gt;ring, a German agent in Bucharest, which was used by the Iron Guard as a pretext to accuse the Conduc&lt;U+0103&gt;tor of having a secret anti-German agenda,153 and made Antonescu oust the Legionary Interior Minister, Constantin Petrovicescu, while closing down all of the Legionary-controlled &quot;Romanianization&quot; offices.154 Various other clashes prompted him to demand the resignation of all Police commanders who sympathized with the movement.155 After two days of widespread violence, which resulted in some 120 deaths among Bucharest's Jewish community,156157 Antonescu sent in the Army, under the command of General Constantin S&lt;U+0103&gt;n&lt;U+0103&gt;tescu.158 German officials acting on Hitler's orders, including the new Ambassador Manfred Freiherr von Killinger, helped Antonescu eliminate the Iron Guardists, but several of their lower-level colleagues actively aided Sima's subordinates.159 Goebbels was especially upset by the decision to support Antonescu, believing it to have been advantageous to &quot;the Freemasons&quot;.160
After the events, Hitler kept open an alternative by granting political asylum to Sima, whom Antonescu's courts sentenced to death, and to other Legionaries in similar situations.161 They were detained in special conditions at Buchenwald and Dachau concentration camps.162 In parallel, Antonescu publicly obtained the cooperation of Codrenists, members of an Iron Guardist wing which had virulently opposed Sima, and whose leader was Codreanu's father Ion Zelea.163 Antonescu again sought backing from the PN&lt;U+0162&gt; and PNL to form a national cabinet, but his rejection of parliamentarism made the two groups refuse him.164
Antonescu traveled to Germany and met Hitler on eight more occasions between June 1941 and August 1944.165 Such close contacts helped cement an enduring relationship between the two dictators, and Hitler reportedly came to see Antonescu as the only trustworthy person in Romania,166167 and the only foreigner to consult on military matters.168 In later statements, he offered praise to Antonescu's &quot;breadth of vision&quot; and &quot;real personality.&quot;169 The German military presence increased significantly in early 1941, when, using Romania as a base, Hitler invaded the rebellious Kingdom of Yugoslavia and the Kingdom of Greece (see Balkans Campaign).170 In parallel, Romania's relationship with the United Kingdom (at the time the only major adversary of Nazi Germany) aggravated into conflict: on February 10, 1941, British Premier Winston Churchill recalled His Majesty's Ambassador Reginald Hoare, and approved the blockade of Romanian ships in British-controlled ports.171
In June of that year, Romania joined the attack on the Soviet Union, led by Germany in coalition with Hungary, Finland, the State of Slovakia, the Kingdom of Italy and the Independent State of Croatia. Antonescu had been made aware of the plan by German envoys, and supported it enthusiastically even before Hitler extended Romania an offer to participate.172 The Romanian force engaged formed a General Antonescu Army Group under the effective command of German general Eugen Ritter von Schobert.173 Romania's campaign on the Eastern Front began without a formal declaration of war, and was consecrated by Antonescu's statement: &quot;Soldiers, I order you, cross the Prut River.&quot;174 A few days after this, the city of Ia&lt;U+015F&gt;i witnessed a large-scale pogrom, which killed thousands and was carried out with Antonescu's agreement (see Ia&lt;U+015F&gt;i pogrom).175176
The first Romanian to be granted the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross, which he received from Hitler at their August 6 meeting in the Ukrainian city of Berdychiv, Ion Antonescu was promoted to Marshal of Romania by royal decree on August 22, in recognition for his role in restoring the eastern frontiers of Greater Romania.177 He took one of his most debated decisions when, with Bessarabia's conquest almost complete, he committed Romania to Hitler's war effort over the Dniester and thrust deeper into Soviet territory, thus waging a war of aggression.178179 On August 30, Romania occupied a territory it deemed &quot;Transnistria&quot;, formerly a part of the Ukrainian SSR (and including the entire Moldavian ASSR).180181 Like the decision to continue the war beyond Bessarabia, this earned Antonescu much criticism from the semi-clandestine PNL and PN&lt;U+0162&gt;.182 Soon after the takeover, the area was assigned to a civil administration apparatus headed by Gheorghe Alexianu and became the site for the main component of the Holocaust in Romania: a mass deportation of the Bessarabian and Ukrainian Jews, followed later by transports of Romani Romanians and Jews from Moldavia proper. The accord over Transnistria's administration, signed in Tighina, also placed areas between the Dniester and the Dnieper under Romanian military occupation, while granting control over all resources to Germany.183
Reversal of fortunes
The Romanian Army's inferior arms, insufficient armor and lack of training had been major concerns for the German commanders since before the start of the operation.184 One of the earliest major obstacles Antonescu encountered on the Eastern Front was the resistance of Odessa, a Soviet port on the Black Sea. Refusing any German assistance, he ordered the Romanian Army to maintain a two-month siege on heavily-fortified and well-defended positions.185186 The ill-equipped 4th Army suffered losses of some 100,000 people.187 Antonescu's popularity again rose in October, when the fall of Odessa was celebrated triumphantly with a parade through Bucharest's Arcul de Triumf, and when many Romanians reportedly believed the war was as good as won.188 In Odessa itself, the aftermath included a large-scale massacre of the Jewish population, ordered by the Marshal as retaliation for a bombing which killed a number of Romanian officers and soldiers (General Ioan Glogojeanu among them).189190 The city subsequently became the administrative capital of Transnistria.191192 According to one account, the Romanian administration planned changing Odessa's name to Antonescu.193
As the Soviet Union recovered from the initial shock and slowed down the Axis offensive at the Battle of Moscow (October 1941-January 1942), Romania was asked by its allies to contribute a larger number of troops.194 A decisive factor in Antonescu's compliance with the request appears to have been a special visit to Bucharest by Wehrmacht commander Wilhelm Keitel, who introduced the Conduc&lt;U+0103&gt;tor to Hitler's plan for attacking the Caucasus (see Battle of the Caucasus).195 The Romanian force engaged in the war reportedly exceeded German demands.196 It came to around 500,000 people197198 and thirty actively-involved divisions.199 As a sign of his satisfaction, Hitler presented his Romanian counterpart with a luxury car.200 On December 7, 1941, after reflecting on the possibility for Romania, Hungary and Finland to change their stance, the British government responded to repeated Soviet requests and declared war on all three countries.201 Following Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor and in compliance with its Axis commitment, Romania declared war on the United States five days later. These developments contrasted Antonescu's own statement of December 7: &quot;I am an ally of the [German] Reich against [the Soviet Union], I am neutral in the conflict between Great Britain and Germany. I am for America against the Japanese.&quot;202
A crucial change in the war came with the Battle of Stalingrad in June 1942-February 1943, a major defeat for the Axis. Romania's armies alone lost some 150,000 men (either dead, wounded or captured)203 and more than half of the country's divisions were wiped out.204 For part of that interval, the Marshal had been withdrawn from public life, owing to an unknown affliction, which is rumored to have been either a mental breakdown, a foodborne illness or a symptom of the syphilis he had allegedly contracted earlier in life.205 He is known to have been suffering from digestive problems, treating himself with food prepared by Marlene von Exner, an Austrian-born dietitian who moved into Hitler's service after 1943.206
Upon his return, Antonescu blamed the Romanian losses on German overseer Arthur Hauffe, whom Hitler agreed to replace.207 In parallel with the military losses, Romania was confronted with large-scale economic problems. While Germany monopolized Romania's exports,208 it defaulted on most of its payments.209 Like all countries whose exports to Germany, particularly in oil, exceeded imports from that country, Romania's economy suffered from Nazi control of the German Reichsmark-leu exchange rate (see Economy of Nazi Germany).210 On the German side, those directly involved in harnessing Romania's economic output for German goals were economic planners Hermann G&lt;U+00F6&gt;ring and Walther Funk, together with Hermann Neubacher, the Special Representative for Economic Problems.211 The situation was further aggravated in 1942, as USAF and RAF were able to bomb the oil fields in Prahova County (see Bombing of Romania in World War II, Operation Tidal Wave).212 Official sources from the following period amalgamate military and civilian losses of all kinds, which produces a total of 554,000 victims of the war.213
In this context, the Romanian leader acknowledged that Germany was losing the war, and he therefore authorized his Deputy Premier and new Foreign Minister Mihai Antonescu to set up contacts with the Allies.214215 In parallel, he allowed the PN&lt;U+0162&gt; and the PNL to engage in parallel talks with the Allies at various locations in neutral countries.216217 The discussions were strained by the Western Allies' call for an unconditional surrender, over which the Romanian envoys bargained with Allied diplomats in Sweden and Egypt (among them the Soviet representatives Nikolai Vasilevich Novikov and Alexandra Kollontai).218 Antonescu was also alarmed by the possibility of war being carried on Romanian territory, as had happened in Italy after Operation Avalanche.219 The events also prompted hostile negotiations aimed at toppling Antonescu, and involving the two political parties, the young monarch, diplomats and soldiers.220221 A major clash between Michael and Antonescu took place during the first days of 1943, when the 21-year old monarch used his New Year's address on national radio to part with the Axis war effort.222
Ouster and arrest

In March 1944, the Soviet Red Army broke the Southern Bug and Dniester fronts, advancing on Bessarabia. This came just as Henry Maitland Wilson, Allied commander of the Mediterranean theater, presented Antonescu with an ultimatum.223 After a new visit to Germany and a meeting with Hitler, Antonescu opted to continue fighting alongside the remaining Axis states, a decision which he later claimed was motivated by Hitler's promise to allow Romania possession of Northern Transylvania in the event of an Axis victory.224 Upon his return, the Conduc&lt;U+0103&gt;tor oversaw a counteroffensive which stabilized the front on a line between Ia&lt;U+015F&gt;i and Chi&lt;U+015F&gt;in&lt;U+0103&gt;u to the north and the lower Dniester to the east.225 This normalized his relations with Nazi German officials, whose alarm over the possible loss of an ally had resulted in the Margarethe II plan, an adapted version of the Nazi takeover in Hungary.226227
However, Antonescu's non-compliance with the terms of Wilson's ultimatum also had drastic effects on Romania's ability to exit the war.228 By then, Antonescu was conceiving of a separate peace with the Western Allies,229230 while maintaining contacts with the Soviets.231 In parallel, the mainstream opposition movement came to establish contacts with the Romanian Communist Party (PCR), which, although minor numerically, gained importance for being the only political group to be favored by Soviet leader Joseph Stalin.232 On the PCR side, the discussions involved Lucre&lt;U+0163&gt;iu P&lt;U+0103&gt;tr&lt;U+0103&gt;&lt;U+015F&gt;canu and later Emil Bodn&lt;U+0103&gt;ra&lt;U+015F&gt;.233234 Another participating group at this stage was the old Romanian Social Democratic Party.235
Large-scale Allied bombings of Bucharest took place in spring 1944, while the Soviet Red Army approached Romanian borders.236 The Battle for Romania began in late summer: while German commanders Johannes Frie&lt;U+00DF&gt;ner and Otto W&lt;U+00F6&gt;hler of the Army Group South Ukraine attempted to hold Bukovina, Soviet Steppe Front leader Rodion Malinovsky stormed into the areas of Moldavia defended by Petre Dumitrescu's troops.237 In reaction, Antonescu attempted to stabilize the front on a line between Foc&lt;U+015F&gt;ani, N&lt;U+0103&gt;moloasa and Br&lt;U+0103&gt;ila, deep inside Romanian territory.238 On August 5, he visited Hitler one final time in K&lt;U+0119&gt;trzyn. On this occasion, the German leader reportedly explained that his people had betrayed the Nazi cause, and asked him if Romania would go on fighting (to which Antonescu reportedly answered in vague terms).239 After the statements of Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov, according to which Romanian subservience was not going to be a requirement,240 the factions opposing Antonescu agreed that the moment had come to overthrow him, by carrying out the Royal Coup of August 23.241242 On that day, the sovereign asked Antonescu to meet him in the royal palace building, where he presented him with a request to take Romania out of its Axis alliance.243244 The Conduc&lt;U+0103&gt;tor refused, and was promptly arrested by soldiers of the guard, being replaced as Premier with General Constantin S&lt;U+0103&gt;n&lt;U+0103&gt;tescu, who presided over a national government.245246
The new Romanian authorities declared peace with the Allies and advised the population to greet Soviet troops.247 On August 25, as Bucharest was successfully defending itself against German retaliations, Romania declared war on Nazi Germany.248 The events disrupted German domination in the Balkans, putting a stop to the Maibaum offensive against Yugoslav Partisans.249 The coup was nevertheless a unilateral move, and, until the signature of an armistice on September 12,250251 the country was still perceived as an enemy by the Soviets, who continued to take Romanian soldiers as prisoners of war.252 In parallel, Hitler reactivated the Iron Guardist exile, creating a Sima-led government in exile which did not survive the war's end in Europe.253
Placed in the custody of PCR militants, Ion Antonescu spent the interval at a house in Bucharest's Vatra Luminoas&lt;U+0103&gt; quarter.254255 He was afterward handed in to the Soviet occupation forces, and transported to Moscow, together with his deputy Mihai Antonescu, Governor of Transnistria Gheorghe Alexianu, Defense Minister Constantin Pantazi, Gendarmerie commander Constantin Vasiliu and Bucharest Police chief Mircea Elefterescu.256257 They was subsequently kept in luxurious detention at a mansion nearby the city,258259 and guarded by SMERSH, a special counter-intelligence body answering directly to Stalin.260 Shortly after the surrender of Germany in May 1945, the group was moved to Lubyanka prison. There, Antonescu was interrogated and reputedly pressured by SMERSH operatives, among them Viktor Semyonovich Abakumov, but transcripts of their conversations were never sent back to Romania by the Soviet authorities.261262 Later research noted that the main issues discussed were the German-Romanian alliance, the war on the Soviet Union, the economic toll on both countries, and Romania's participation in the Holocaust (defined specifically as crimes against &quot;peaceful Soviet citizens&quot;).263 At some point during this period, Antonescu attempted suicide in his quarters.264265 He was returned to Bucharest in spring 1946, being held in Jilava prison. He was subsequently interrogated by prosecutor Avram Bunaciu, to whom he complained about the conditions of his detainment, contrasting them with those in Moscow, while explaining that he was a vegetarian and demanding a special diet.266
Trial and execution
 In May 1946, Ion Antonescu was prosecuted at the first in a series of People's Tribunals, on charges of war crimes, crimes against the peace and treason.267268 The idea of organizing it had first been proposed by the PN&lt;U+0162&gt;,269 and was compatible with the Nuremberg Trials in Allied-occupied Germany.270271 The Romanian legislative framework was drafted by coup participant P&lt;U+0103&gt;tr&lt;U+0103&gt;&lt;U+015F&gt;canu, who had been granted leadership of the Justice Ministry as a PCR member.272 Despite the idea having earned support from several sides of the political spectrum, the procedures were politicized in a sense favorable to the PCR and the Soviet Union,273274 and posed a legal problem for being based on ex post facto decisions.275 The first such local trial took place in 1945, resulting in the sentencing of Iosif Iacobici, Nicolae Macici, Constantin Trestioreanu and other soldiers commanders directly involved in planning or carrying out the Odessa massacre.276
Antonescu was represented by Constantin Paraschivescu-B&lt;U+0103&gt;l&lt;U+0103&gt;ceanu and Titus Stoica, two public defenders whom he had first consulted with a day before the procedures were initiated.277 The prosecution team, led by Vasile Stoican, and the panel of judges, presided over by Alexandru Voitinovici, were infiltrated by PCR supporters.278 Both consistently failed to admit that Antonescu's foreign policies were overall dictated by Romania's positioning between Germany and the Soviet Union.279280 Nevertheless, and although references to the mass murders formed just 23% of the indictment and corpus of evidence (ranking below charges of anti-Soviet aggression),281 the procedures also included Antonescu's admission of and self-exculpating take on war crimes, including the deportations to Transnistria.282283 They also evidence his awareness of the Odessa massacre, accompanied by his claim that few of the deaths were his direct responsibility.284 One notable event at the trial was a testimony by PN&lt;U+0162&gt; leader Iuliu Maniu. Reacting against the aggressive tone of other accusers, Maniu went on record saying: &quot;We [Maniu and Antonescu] were political adversaries, not cannibals.&quot;285 Upon leaving the bench, Maniu walked toward Antonescu and shook his hand.286287
Ion Antonescu was found guilty of the charges. This verdict was followed by two sets of appeals, which claimed that the restored and amended 1923 Constitution did not offer a framework for the People's Tribunals and prevented capital punishment during peacetime, while noting that, contrary to the armistice agreement, only one power represented within the Allied Commission had supervised the tribunal.288 They were both rejected within six days, in compliance with a legal deadline on the completion of trials by the People's Tribunals.289 King Michael subsequently received pleas for clemency from Antonescu's lawyer and his mother, and reputedly considered asking the Allies to reassess the case as part of the actual Nuremberg Trials, taking Romanian war criminals into foreign custody.290 Subjected to pressures by the new Soviet-backed Petru Groza executive, he issued a decree in favor of execution.291 Together with his co-defendants Mihai Antonescu, Alexianu and Vasiliu, the former Conduc&lt;U+0103&gt;tor was executed by a military firing squad on June 1, 1946. Ion Antonescu's supporters circulated false rumors that regular soldiers had refused to fire at their commander, and that the squad was mostly composed of Jewish policemen.292 Another apologetic claim insists that he himself ordered the squad to shoot, but footage of the event has proven it false.293 It is however attested that he refused a blindfold and raised his hat in salute once the order was given.294 The execution site, some distance away from the locality of Jilava and the prison fort, was known as Valea Piersicilor (&quot;Valley of the Peach Trees&quot;).295296 His final written statement was a letter to his wife, urging her to withdraw into a convent, while stating the belief that posterity would reconsider his deeds and accusing Romanians of being &quot;ungrateful&quot;.297
Ideology
Nationalism and expansionism
 Nationalism was a main motivator behind Antonescu's policies. A firm believer in the restoration of Greater Romania as the union of lands inhabited by Romanian ethnics, he permanently objected to Northern Transylvania's incorporation into Hungary. Although both countries were technically allied through the Axis system, their relationship was always tense, and marked by serious diplomatic incidents.298 The Romanian leader kept contacts with representatives of ethnic Romanian communities directly affected by the Second Vienna Award, including Transylvanian Greek-Catholic clergy.299 Another aspect of Antonescu's nationalist policies was evidenced after the Balkans Campaign. Antonescu's Romania did not partake in the military action, but laid a claim to the territories in eastern Vojvodina (western Banat) and the Timok Valley, home to a sizable Romanian community. Reportedly, Germany's initial designs of attributing Vojvodina to Hungary enhanced the tensions between Antonescu and Mikl&lt;U+00F3&gt;s Horthy to the point where war between the two countries became a possibility.300 Such incidents made Germany indefinitely prolong its occupation of the region.301 The Romanian authorities issued projects for an independent Macedonia with autonomy for its Aromanian communities,302 while an official memorandum on the Timok region, approved by Antonescu, made mention of &quot;Romanian&quot; areas &quot;from Timok [...] to Salonika&quot;.303 The Conduc&lt;U+0103&gt;tor also maintained contacts with Aromanian fascists in Axis-occupied Greece, awarding refuge to Principality of Pindus leaders Alchiviad Diamandi di Samarina and Nicola Matushi, whose pro-Romanian policies had brought them into conflict with other Macedonian factions.304
Conduc&lt;U+0103&gt;tor Antonescu thought Hitler willing to revise his stance on Northern Transylvania, and claimed to have obtained the German leader's agreement, using it to justify participation on the Eastern Front after the recovery of Bessarabia.305306 However, transcripts of the Hitler-Antonescu conversations do not validate his interpretation.307308 Another version has it that Hitler sent Antonescu a letter informing him that Bessarabia's political status was ultimately depending on German decisions.309 In one of his letters to Hitler, Antonescu himself stated an anti-communist ideological motivation: &quot;I confirm that I will pursue operations in the east to the end against that great enemy of civilization, of Europe, and of my country: Russian Bolshevism [...] I will not be swayed by anyone not to extend this military cooperation into new territory.&quot;310 Antonescu's ideological perspective blended national sentiment with generically Christian and particularly Romanian Orthodox traits. This identity issue is confronted by British historian Arnold D. Harvey with Nazi doctrine and its anti-religious elements: &quot;It seems that Hitler was not even perturbed by the militant Christian orientation of the Antonescu regime&quot;.311
It is also possible that, contrary to Antonescu's own will, Hitler viewed the transfer of Transnistria as compensation for the Transylvanian areas, and that he therefore considered the matter closed.312 According to the Romanian representative in Berlin, Raoul Bossy, various German and Hungarian officials recommended the extension of permanent Romanian rule into Transnistria, as well as into Podolia, Galicia and Pokuttya, in exchange for delivering the whole of Transylvania to Hungary (and relocating its ethnic Romanian majority to the new provinces).313 American political scientist Charles King writes: &quot;There was never any attempt to annex the occupied territory [of Transnistria], for it was generally considered by the Romanian government to be a temporary buffer zone between Greater Romania and the Soviet front line.&quot;314 At his 1946 trial, Antonescu claimed that Transnistria had been occupied to prevent Romania being caught in a &quot;pincer&quot; by Germany, &quot;the question of Drang nach Osten&quot;, and the Volksdeutsche communities, while denying charges of having exploited the region for Romania's benefit.315
Romanian historian Lucian Boia believes that Ion Antonescu may have nevertheless had expansionist goals to the east, and that he implicitly understood Operation Barbarossa as a tool for containing Slavic peoples.316 Similar verdicts are provided by other researchers.317 Another Romanian historian, Ottmar Tra&lt;U+015F&gt;c&lt;U+0103&gt;, argues that Antonescu did not wish to annex the region &quot;at least until the end of the war&quot;, but notes that Antonescu's own statements make reference to its incorporation in the event of a victory.318 In addition to early annexation plans to the Southern Bug (reportedly confessed to Bossy in June 1941),319 the Conduc&lt;U+0103&gt;tor is known to have presented his ministers with designs for the region's colonization.320 The motivation he cited was alleged malnutrition among Romanian peasants, to which he added: &quot;I'll take this population, I'll lead it into Transnistria, where I shall give it all the land it requires&quot;.321 Several nationalists sympathetic to Antonescu acclaimed the extension of Romanian rule into Transnistria, which they understood as permanent.322
Antisemitism and antiziganism
A recurring element in Antonescu's doctrines is racism, and in particular antisemitism. This was linked to his sympathy for ethnocratic ideals, and complimented by his statements in favor of &quot;integral nationalism&quot; and &quot;Romanianism&quot;.323 Like other far right Romanians, he saw a Jewish presence behind liberal democracy, and believed in the existence of Judeo-Masonry.324 His earliest thoughts on Codreanu's ideology criticize the Legionary leader for advocating &quot;brutal measures&quot; in dealing with the &quot;invasion of Jews&quot;, and instead propose &quot;the organization of Romanian classes&quot; as a method for reaching the same objective.325 Politician Aureliu Weiss, who met General Antonescu during that interval, recalled that, although antisemitic &quot;to the core&quot;, he was capable of restrain in public.326 According to historian Mihail Ionescu, the Conduc&lt;U+0103&gt;tor was not averse to the Iron Guard's &quot;Legionary principles&quot;, but wanted antisemitism to be &quot;applied in an orderly fashion&quot;, as opposed to Horia Sima's revolutionary ways.327 Historian Ioan Scurtu believes that, during the Legionary Rebellion, Antonescu deliberately waited before stepping in, in order for the Guard to be &quot;profoundly discredited&quot; and for himself to be perceived as a &quot;savior&quot;.328 In April 1941, he let his ministers know that he was considering letting &quot;the mob&quot; deal with the Jews, &quot;and after the slaughter, I will restore order.&quot;329 Lucian Boia notes that the Romanian leader was indeed motivated by antisemitic beliefs, but that these need to be contextualized in order to understand what separates Antonescu from Hitler in terms of radicalism.330 However, various other researchers assess that, by aligning himself with Hitler before and during Operation Barbarossa, Antonescu implicitly agreed with his thoughts on the &quot;Jewish Question&quot;, choosing racial over religious antisemitism.331332 According to Harvey, the Ia&lt;U+015F&gt;i pogrom made the Germans &quot;evidently willing to accept that organized Christianity in Romania was very different from what it was in Germany&quot;.333
Antonescu was a firm believer in the conspiracy theory of &quot;Jewish Bolshevism&quot;, according to which all Jews were supporters of communism and the Soviet Union.334335 His arguments on the matter involved a spurious claim that, during the 1940 retreat from Bessarabia, the Jews had organized themselves and attacked Romanian soldiers.336337 In part, this notion exaggerated unilateral reports of enthusiasm among the marginalized Jews upon the arrival of Red Army troops.338 In a summer 1941 address to his ministers, Antonescu stated: &quot;The Satan is the Jew. [Ours] is a battle of life and death. Either we win and the world will be purified, either they win and we will become their slaves.&quot;339 At around the same time, he envisaged the ethnic cleansing (&quot;cleaning out&quot;) of Jews from the eastern Romanian-held territories.340341 However, as early as February 1941, Antonescu was also contemplating the ghettoization of all Jewish Romanians, as an early step toward their expulsion.342 In this context, Antonescu frequently depicted Jews as a disease or a poison.343 After the Battle of Stalingrad, he encouraged the army commanders to resist the counteroffensive, as otherwise the Soviets &quot;will bring Bolshevism to the country, wipe out the entire leadership stratum, impose the Jews on us, and deport masses of our people.&quot;344
Ion Antonescu's antiziganism manifested itself as the claim that some or all Romani people, specifically nomadic ones, were given to criminal behavior.345 Such a view was contrasted by the regime's own actions: in various cases, those deported had close relatives drafted into the Romanian Army.346 Although racist slogans targeting Romani people had been popularized by the Iron Guard, it was only under Antonescu's unchallenged rule that solving the &quot;Gypsy problem&quot; became official policy and antiziganist measures were enforced.347 After a February 1941 inspection, Antonescu singled out Bucharest's Romani community for alleged offenses committed during the blackout, and called on his ministers to present him with solutions.348 Initially, he contemplated sending all Romani people he considered undesirable to the inhospitable B&lt;U+0103&gt;r&lt;U+0103&gt;gan Plain, to join the ranks of a local community of manual laborers.349 In 1942, he commissioned the Romanian Central Institute for Statistics to compile a report on Romani demography, which, in its edited form, provided scientifically racist conclusions, warning the Conduc&lt;U+0103&gt;tor about alleged Romani-Romanian miscegenation in rural Romania.350 In doing so, Antonescu offered some credit to a marginal and pseudoscientific trend in Romanian sociology, which, basing itself on eugenic theories, recommended the marginalization, deportation or compulsory sterilization of the Romani people, whose numeric presence it usually exaggerated.351 Among those who signed the report was demographer Sabin Manuil&lt;U+0103&gt;, who saw the Romani presence as a major racial problem.352 The exact effect of the report's claims on Antonescu is uncertain.353
Fascism and conservatism
There is a historiographic dispute about whether Ion Antonescu's regime was fascist or more generically right-wing authoritarian, itself integrated within a larger debate about the aspects and limits of fascism. Israeli historian of fascism Zeev Sternhell describes Antonescu, alongside his European counterparts Pierre-&lt;U+00C9&gt;tienne Flandin, Francisco Franco, Mikl&lt;U+00F3&gt;s Horthy, Fran&lt;U+00E7&gt;ois de La Rocque, Philippe P&lt;U+00E9&gt;tain and Italian King Victor Emmanuel III, as a &quot;conservative&quot;, noting that all of them &quot;were not deceived by a [fascist] propaganda trying to place them in the same category [as the fascist movements].&quot;354 A similar verdict is provided by German historian of Europe Hagen Schulze, who views Horthy, Franco and the Romanian leader alongside Portugal's Estado Novo theorist Ant&lt;U+00F3&gt;nio de Oliveira Salazar and Second Polish Republic founder J&lt;U+00F3&gt;zef Pi&lt;U+0142&gt;sudski, as rulers of &quot;either purely military dictatorships, or else authoritarian governments run by civilian politicians&quot;, and thus a category apart from the leaders of &quot;Fascist states.&quot;355 For Schulze, the defining elements of such governments is the presence of a &quot;conservative establishment&quot; which ensured &quot;social stability&quot; by extending the control of a &quot;traditional state&quot; (thus effectively blocking &quot;revolutionary suggestions&quot; from the far left and the far right alike).356 The term &quot;conservative autocrat&quot; is used in relation to the Conduc&lt;U+0103&gt;tor by British political theorist Roger Griffin, who attributes to the Iron Guard the position of a subservient fascist movement,357 while others identify Antonescu's post-1941 rule as a military rather than a fascist dictatorship.358 A preference for &quot;conservative&quot; as a defining term for Antonescu's policies is shown by several other scholars.359360 Antonescu described himself as &quot;by fate a dictator&quot;, and explained that his policies were &quot;militaristic&quot;361 or, on one occasion, &quot;national-totalitarian&quot;.362
Nevertheless, other historians theorize a synthesis of fascist and conservative elements, performed by Antonescu and other European leaders of his day. Routledge's 2002 Companion to Fascism and the Far Right uses the terms &quot;para-fascist&quot; to define Antonescu, adding: &quot;generally regarded as an authoritarian conservative [Antonescu] incorporated fascism into his regime, in the shape of the Iron Guard, rather than embodying fascism himself.&quot;363 &quot;Para-fascist&quot; is also used by Griffin, to denote both Antonescu and Carol II.364 American historian of fascism Robert Paxton notes that, like Salazar, Romania's dictator crushed a competing fascist movement, &quot;after copying some of [its] techniques of popular mobilization.&quot;365 Political scientists John Gledhill and Charles King discuss the Iron Guard as Romania's &quot;indigenous fascist movement&quot;, remark that Antonescu &quot;adopted much of the ideology of the Guardists&quot;, and conclude that the regime he led was &quot;openly fascist&quot;.366 References to the fascist traits of Antonescu's dictatorship are also made by other researchers.367368
The synthetic aspect of Antonescu's rule is discussed in detail by various authors. British historian Dennis Deletant, who notes that the fascist label relies on both Antonescu's adoption of some fascist &quot;trappings&quot; and the &quot;dichotomy of wartime and postwar evaluation&quot; of his regime, also notes that post-1960 interpretations &quot;do more to explain his behaviour than the preceding orthodoxy.&quot;369 Deletant contrasts the lack of &quot;mass political party or ideology&quot; with the type of rule associated with Nazism or Italian fascism.370 British-born sociologist and political analyst Michael Mann writes: &quot;The authoritarian regimes of Antonescu [...] and Franco [...] purported to be 'traditional', but actually their fascist-derived corporatism was a new immanent ideology of the right.&quot;371 Another distinct view is held by Romanian-born historian of ideas Juliana Geran Pilon, who describes Romania's &quot;military fascist regime&quot; as a successor to Iron Guardist &quot;mystical nationalism&quot;, while mentioning that Antonescu's &quot;national ideology was rather more traditionally militaristic and conservative.&quot;372
Power base, administration and propaganda
 A theoretical revolutionary aspect was provided for by Antonescu's policies. The leader himself claimed: &quot;I want to introduce a patriotic, heroic, military-typed education, because economic education and all the others follow from it.&quot;373 According to Boia, his arrival in power was explicitly meant to &quot;regenerate&quot; Romania, and his popularity hinged on his being perceived as a &quot;totalitarian model&quot; and a &quot;savior&quot; figure, like Corneliu Zelea Codreanu and Carol II before him.374 The &quot;providential&quot; and &quot;savior&quot; themes are also emphasized by historian Adrian Majuru, who notes that Antonescu both adopted such ideals and criticized Carol for failing to live up to them.375 Seeing his rule as legitimized by the national interest,376377 the general is also known to have referred to political pluralism as poltronerie (&quot;poltroonishness&quot;).378 Accordingly, Antonescu formally outlawed all political forces in February 1941, codifying penal labor as punishment for most public forms of political expression.379 In Deletant's assessment, his regenerative program was more declarative than factual, and contradicted by Antonescu's own decision to allow the informal existence of some opposition forces.380 At the same time, his monopolizing of power in the name of a German alliance is believed by some historians to have turned Romania into either a &quot;puppet state&quot; of Hitler381 or one of Germany's &quot;satellite&quot; governments.382 However, Deletant notes: &quot;Romania retained her sovereignty throughout the period of the alliance [with Nazi Germany]. [...] Antonescu had, of course, his own country's interests uppermost in his mind, but in following Hitler, he served the Nazi cause.&quot;383 He describes Romania's contribution to the war as that of &quot;a principal ally of Germany&quot;, as opposed to a &quot;minor Axis satellite.&quot;384
Although he assigned an unimportant role to King Michael, Antonescu took steps to increase the monarchy's prestige, personally inviting Carol's estranged wife, Queen Mother Helen, to return home.385 However, his preferred military structures functioned in cooperation with a bureaucracy inherited from the National Renaissance Front.386387 According to historian of fascism Philip Morgan: &quot;Antonescu probably wanted to create, or perpetuate, something like Carol's front organization.&quot;388 Much of his permanent support base comprised former National Christian Party members, to the point where he was seen as successor to Octavian Goga.389 While maintaining a decorative replacement for Parliament, known as Adunarea Ob&lt;U+015F&gt;teasc&lt;U+0103&gt; Plebiscitar&lt;U+0103&gt; a Na&lt;U+0163&gt;iunii Rom&lt;U+00E2&gt;ne (&quot;The General Plebiscitary Assembly of the Romanian Nation&quot;) and only convoked twice,390 he took charge of hierarchical appointments, and personally drafted new administrative projects. In 1941, he disestablished participative government in localities and counties, replacing it with a corporatist structure appointed by prefects whom he had named.391 In stages between August and October 1941, he instituted the civilian administration of Transnistria under Governor Gheorghe Alexianu, whose status he made equivalent to that of a cabinet minister.392 Similar measures were taken in Bukovina and Bessarabia (under Governors Corneliu Calotescu and Gheorghe Voiculescu respectively).393 Antonescu strictly relied on the chain of command, and his direct orders to the Army overrode civilian hierarchies, a system which allowed room for endemic political corruption and administrative confusion.394 The Romanian leader also tolerated a gradual loss of authority over the German communities in Romania, in particular the Saxon and Swabian groups, in agreement with Hitler's views on the Volksdeutsche. This trend was initiated by Saxon Nazi activist Andreas Schmidt in cooperation with the Volksdeutsche Mittelstelle,395 resulting in de facto self-governance under a Nazi system396 which was also replicated among the 130,000 Black Sea Germans of Transnistria.397 Many young German Romanian men opted to join the Schutzstaffel as early as 1940 and, in 1943, an accord between Antonescu and Hitler automatically sent ethnic Germans of recruitable age into the Wehrmacht.398
The regime was characterized by the leader's attempts to regulate even remote aspects of public life, including relations between the sexes. He imposed drastic penalties for misdemeanors,399 and the legal use of capital punishment was extended to an unprecedented level.400 He personally set standards for nightclub programs, for the length of skirts and for women's use of bicycles,401 while forcing all men to wear coats in public.402 His wife Maria was a patron of state-approved charitable organizations, initially designed to compete with successful Iron Guardist ventures such as Ajutorul Legionar.403 According to Romanian-born gender studies academic Maria Bucur, although the regime allowed women &quot;to participate in the war effort on the front in a more regularized, if still marginal, fashion&quot;, the general tone was sexist.404
The administrative apparatus included official press and propaganda sectors, which had rapidly moved from constructing Carol's personality cult to doing the same for the new military leader: journals Universul and Timpul, as well as Camil Petrescu's Rom&lt;U+00E2&gt;nia magazine, were particularly active in this process.405 Some other such venues were Porunca Vremii,406 Nichifor Crainic's Sfarm&lt;U+0103&gt;-Piatr&lt;U+0103&gt;,407 as well as all the seemingly independent newspapers and some ten new periodicals the government founded for this purpose.408 Among the individual journalists involved in propaganda were Crainic, Petrescu, Stelian Popescu,409410 and Curentul editor Pamfil &lt;U+015E&gt;eicaru411 (the Conduc&lt;U+0103&gt;tor purposefully ignored support from Carol's former adviser, corporatist economist and newspaperman Mihail Manoilescu, whom he reportedly despised).412 Much of the propaganda produced during the Antonescu era supported the antisemitic theses put forth by the Conduc&lt;U+0103&gt;tor.413 Antisemitism was notable and virulent at the level of Romanian Army units addressing former Soviet citizens in occupied lands, and reflected the regime's preference for the ethnic slur jidani (&quot;kikes&quot;).414 The religious aspect of anti-communism surfaced in such venues, which frequently equated Operation Barbarossa with a holy war or a crusade.415 Romania's other enemies were generally treated differently: Antonescu himself issued objections to the anti-British propaganda of explicitly pro-Nazi papers such as Porunca Vremii.416 A special segment of Antonescu's post-1941 propaganda was Codrenist: it revisited the Iron Guard's history to minimize Sima's contributions and to depict him as radically different from Codreanu.417
Antonescu and the Holocaust

Ia&lt;U+015F&gt;i pogrom

 Three weeks after gaining power and inaugurating the National Legionary regime, Ion Antonescu declared to Italian interviewers at La Stampa that solving the &quot;Jewish Question&quot; was his pressing concern, and that he considered himself &quot;haunted&quot; by the large Jewish presence in Moldavian towns.418 Antonescu's crimes against the Jewish population were inaugurated by new racial discrimination laws: urban Jewish property was expropriated, Jews were banned from performing a wide range of occupations and forced to provide community work for the state (munc&lt;U+0103&gt; de interes ob&lt;U+015F&gt;tesc) instead of the inaccessible military service,419 mixed Romanian-Jewish marriages were forbidden and many Jews, primarily those from strategic areas such as Ploie&lt;U+015F&gt;ti, were confined to internment camps.420 The expulsion of Jewish professionals from all walks of life was also carried out in the National Legionary period, and enforced after the Legionary Rebellion.421 After a post-Legionary hiatus, &quot;Romanianization&quot; commissions resumed their work under the supervision of a National Center, and their scope was extended.422
Often discussed as a prelude to the Holocaust in Romania and in connection with Antonescu's views on &quot;Jewish Bolshevism&quot;, the Ia&lt;U+015F&gt;i pogrom occurred just days after the start of Operation Barbarossa, and was partly instigated, partly tolerated by the authorities in Bucharest. For a while before the massacre, these issued propaganda claiming that the Jews in Ia&lt;U+015F&gt;i, whose numbers had been increased by forced evictions from smaller localities,423 were actively helping Soviet bombers find their targets through the blackout and plotting against the authorities, with Antonescu himself ordering for the entire community to be expelled from the city on such grounds.424425 The discourse appealed to local antisemites, whose murderous rampage, carried out with the officials' complicity, resulted in several thousand deaths among Jewish men, women and children.426427
In the aftermath of the pogrom, thousands of survivors were loaded into the so-called &quot;death trains&quot;. These overcrowded and sealed Romanian Railways stock cars circled the countryside in the extreme heat of the summer, and periodically stopped to unload the dead.428429 It is known that, altogether, at least 4,000 people died during the initial massacre and the transports.430 Estimates of the Ia&lt;U+015F&gt;i massacre and related killings place that number at 8,000,431 10,000,432 12,000 or 14,000433434 Jewish people. Some assistance in their murder was provided by units of the German XXXth Army Corps, a matter which later allowed the authorities to shift blame from themselves and from Antonescu&lt;U+2014&gt;who was nonetheless implicated by the special orders he had released.435436 The complicity of the Special Intelligence Service and its director Eugen Cristescu was also advanced as a possibility.437 The subsequent attempts at a cover-up included omissive explanations given by the central authorities to foreign diplomats and rewriting official records.438
Transnistria

 Right upon setting up camp in Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina, Romanian troops joined the Wehrmacht and the Schutzstaffel-organized Einsatzgruppen in mass shootings of Bessarabian and Ukrainian Jews,439440 resulting in the deaths of 10,000441 to 20,000 people.442 Scholar Christopher R. Browning compares these killings with similar atrocities perpetrated by locals in Reichskommissariat Ukraine, Lithuania and Latvia (see Holocaust in Latvia, Holocaust in Lithuania, Holocaust in Ukraine).443 From then on, as the fighting troops progressed over the Dniester, the local administration deported large numbers of Jews into the fighting zone, in hopes that they would be exterminated by the Germans.444445 Antonescu himself stated: &quot;I am in favor of expelling the Jews from Bessarabia and [Northern] Bukovina to the other side of the border [...]. There is nothing for them to do here and I don't mind if we appear in history as barbarians [...]. There has never been a time more suitable in our history to get rid of the Jews, and if necessary, you are to make use of machine guns against them.&quot;446 He also explained that his aim was: &quot;the policy of purification of the Romanian race, and I will not give way before any obstacle in achieving this historical goal of our nation. If we do not take advantage of the situation which presents itself today [...] we shall miss the last chance that history offers to us. And I do not wish to miss it, because if I do so further generations will blame me.&quot;447 He made a contradictory statement about the murder of Jews in Chi&lt;U+015F&gt;in&lt;U+0103&gt;u, claiming that their perpetrators were &quot;bastards&quot; who &quot;stained&quot; his regime's reputation.448
Many deaths followed, as the direct results of starvation and exhaustion,449450 while the local German troops carried out selective shootings.451 The survivors were sent back over the river, and the German commanders expressing irritation over the methods applied by their counterparts.452453 Romanian authorities subsequently introduced ghettos or transit camps.454455 After the annexation of Transnistria, there ensued a systematic deportation of Jews from Bessarabia, with additional transports of Jews from the Old Kingdom (especially Moldavia-proper).456457 Based on an assignment Antonescu handed down to General Ioan Topor,458 the decision involved specific quotas, and the transports, most of which were carried out by foot, involved random murders.459460 In conjunction with Antonescu's expansionist ambitions, it is possible that the ultimate destination for the survivors, once circumstances permitted it, was further east than the Southern Bug.461 The deportees' remaining property was nationalized, confiscated or left available for plunder.462 With its own Jewish population confined and subjected to extermination,463464 Transnistria became infamous in short time, especially so for its three main concentration camps: Peciora, Akhmechetka, Bogdanovka, Domanovka and Obodovka.465466 Manned by Romanian Gendarmes and local Ukrainian auxiliaries who acted with the consent of central authorities, Transnistrian localities became the sites of mass executions, particularly after the administrators became worried about the spread of typhus from the camps and into the surrounding region.467468 The last wave of Jewish deportations, occurring in June 1942, came mainly from the Cern&lt;U+0103&gt;u&lt;U+0163&gt;i area in Northern Bukovina.469470
Also in summer 1942, Ion Antonescu became a perpetrator of the Porajmos, or Holocaust-related crimes against the Romani people, when he ordered the Transnistrian deportation of Romani people from the Old Kingdom, transited through camps and resettled in inhumane conditions near the Southern Bug.471472 They were joined there by 2,000 conscientious objectors of the Inochentist church, a millennialist denomination.473 As Antonescu admitted during his trial, he personally supervised these operations, giving special orders to the Gendarmerie commanders.474 In theory, the measures taken against Romani people were supposed to affect only nomads and those with a criminal record created or updated recently, but arbitrary exceptions were immediately made to this rule, in particular by using the vague notion of &quot;undesirable&quot; to define some members of sedentary communities.475 The central authorities noted differences in the criteria applied locally, and intervened to prevent or sanction under-deportation and, in some cases, over-deportation.476 Antonescu and Constantin Vasiliu had been made aware of the problems Transnistria faced in feeding its own population, but ignored them when deciding in favor of expulsion.477 With most of their property confiscated,478 the Romani men, women and children were only allowed to carry hand luggage, on which they were supposed to survive winter.479 Famine and disease ensued from criminal negligence, Romani survival being largely dependent on occasional government handouts, the locals' charity, stealing and an underground economy.480 Once caught, escapees who made their way back into Romania were returned by the central authorities, even as local ones were objecting.481
Odessa massacre

The Odessa massacre, carried out by the Romanian Army and Gendarmes, took the lives of a minimum of between 15,000482 and 25,000483 to as many as 40,000484 or even more than 50,000485486 Jewish people of all ages. The measure came as the enforcement of Antonescu's own orders, being justified by his belief that the original explosion was a terrorist act (despite the possibility of the building in question having been fitted with land mines by the retreating Soviets).487488 In addition, Antonescu blamed the Jews, specifically &quot;Jewish commissars&quot; in the Red Army, for the losses suffered by his 4th Army throughout the siege,489 although both an inquiry he had ordered and German assessments pointed to the ill-preparedness of Romanian soldiers.490 While the local command took the initiative for the first executions, Antonescu's personal intervention amplified the number of victims required, and included specific quotas (200 civilians for every dead officer, 100 for every dead soldier).491 By the time of the explosion, the Jewish population was already rounded up into makeshift ghettos, being made subject to violence and selective murders.492
Purportedly the largest single massacre of Jews in the war's history,493 it involved mass shootings, hangings, acts of immolation and a mass detonation.494495 Antonescu is quoted saying that the Romanian Army's criminal acts were &quot;reprisals, not massacres&quot;.496 Survivors were deported to the nearby settlement of Slobidka, and kept in inhumane conditions. Alexianu himself intervened with Antonescu for a solution to their problems, but the Romanian leader decided he wanted them out of the Odessa area, citing the nearby resistance of Soviet troops in the Siege of Sevastopol as a ferment for similar Jewish activities.497 His order to Alexianu specified: &quot;Pack them into the catacombs, throw them into the Black Sea, but get them out of Odessa. I don't want to know. A hundred can die, a thousand can die, all of them can die, but I don't want a single Romanian official or officer to die.&quot;498 Defining the presence of Jews in occupied Odessa as &quot;a crime&quot;, Antonescu added: &quot;I don't want to stain my activity with such lack of foresight.&quot;499 As a result of this, around 35,000-40,000 Jewish people were deported out of Odessa area and into other sectors of Transnistria.500 Several thousands were purposefully driven into Berezivka and other areas inhabited by the Black Sea Germans, where Selbstschutz organizations massacred them.501
Overall death toll and particularities
 A common assessment ranks Antonescu's Romania as second only to Nazi Germany in what concerns the means and ends of its antisemitic extermination policies.502 According to historians Dennis Deletant and Adrian Cioroianu both, the flaws of Antonescu's 1946 trial notwithstanding, his responsibility for war crimes signifies that he had an equal chance of being found guilty and executed within a Western Allied jurisdiction.503 The often singular brutality of Romanian-organized massacres was a special topic of reflection for Jewish Holocaust escapee and American political theorist Hannah Arendt, as discussed in her 1963 work Eichmann in Jerusalem.504 Official Romanian estimates made in 2003 by the Wiesel Commission mention that between 280,000 and 380,000 Jews were killed by Romanian authorities under Antonescu's rule.505506 The Transnistria deportations account for 150,000 to 170,000 individual expulsions of Jews from Romania-proper, of whom some 90,000-120,000 admittedly never returned.507508 According to Romanian-born Israeli historian Jean Ancel, the Transnistria deportations from other areas account for around 145,000 deaths, while the number of local Transnistrian Jews killed could be as high as 280,000.509 More conservative estimates for the latter number mention some 130,000-180,000 victims.510 Other overall estimates speak of 200,000511 to 300,000 or over512 Jews purposefully killed as a result of Romania's action. According to historians Antony Polonsky and Joanna B. Michlic: &quot;none of these massacres was carried out by the Germans, although [the latter] certainly encouraged such actions and, in some cases, may have coordinated them.&quot;513 The Romani deportations affected some 25,000 people, at least 11,000 of whom died in Transnistria.514
The Jewish population in the Old Kingdom, numbering between 300,000 and 400,000 people, survived the Holocaust almost intact.515 Reflecting on this fact, Lucian Boia noted that Antonescu could not &quot;decently&quot; be viewed as a rescuer of Jews, but that there still is a fundamental difference between the effects of his rule and those of Hitler's, concluding that the overall picture is not &quot;completely dark.&quot;516 For Dennis Deletant, this situation is a &quot;major paradox&quot; of Antonescu's time in power: &quot;more Jews survived under [Antonescu's] rule than in any other country within Axis Europe.&quot;517 American historian of Romania William O. Oldson views Antonescu's policies as characterized by &quot;violence, inconsistency and inanity&quot;,518 but places them in the wider context of local antisemitism, noting some ideological exceptions from their respective European counterparts. These traits, he argues, became &quot;providential&quot; for the more assimilated Jewish communities of the Old Romanian Kingdom, while exposing Jews perceived as foreign.519 Discussing Antonescu's policy of ethnic cleansing, Polonksy and Mihlic note: &quot;[it] raises important questions about the thin line between the desire to expel an unwanted minority and a small-scale genocidal project under sanctioned conditions.&quot;520 American military historian Gerhard L. Weinberg made reference to the Antonescu regime's &quot;slaughter of large number of Jews in the areas ceded to the Soviet Union in 1940 when those areas were retaken in 1941 as well as in [...] Transnistria&quot;, but commented: &quot;the government of Marshal Ion Antonescu preferred to rob and persecute Jews [from Romania]; the government would not turn them over to the Germans for killing.&quot;521
Alongside the noticeable change in fortunes on the Eastern Front, a main motivator for all post-1943 changes, noted by various historians, was the manifold financial opportunity of Jewish survival.522 Wealthier Jews were financially extorted in order to avoid community work and deportation, and the work of some professionals was harnessed by the public sector, and even by the Army.523 From the beginning, the regime had excepted from deportations some Jews who were experts in fields such as forestry and chemistry, and some others were even allowed to return despite antisemitic protests in their home provinces.524 Economic exploitation was institutionalized in late 1941-early 1942, with the creation of a Central Jewish Office. Supervised by Commissioner Radu Lecca and formally led by the Jewish intellectuals Nandor Gingold and Henric Streitman, it collected funds which were in part redirected toward Maria Antonescu's charities.525 Small numbers of Romanian Jews left independently for the Palestine as early as 1941, but British opposition to Zionist plans made their transfer perilous (one notorious example of this being the ship Struma).526 On a personal level, Antonescu's encouragement of crimes alternated with periods when he gave in to the pleas of Jewish community leader Wilhelm Filderman.527 In one such instance, he reversed his own 1942 decision to impose the wearing of yellow badges,528 which nevertheless remained in use everywhere outside the Old Kingdom and, in theory, its Jewish diaspora.529 Assessing these contradictions, commentators also mention the effect of Allied promises to prosecute those responsible for genocide throughout Europe.530 In the late stages of the war, Antonescu was attempting to shift all blame for crimes from his regime531 while accusing Jews of &quot;bring[ing] destruction upon themselves&quot;.532
The regime permitted non-deported Romanian Jews and American charities to send humanitarian aid into Transnistrian camps, a measure it took an interest in enforcing in late 1942.533534 Deportations of Jews ceased altogether in October of the same year. A common explanation historians propose for this reassessment of policies is the change in Germany's fortunes on the Eastern Front, with mention that Antonescu was considering using the Jewish population as an asset in his dealings with the Western Allies.535536 It nevertheless took the regime more than a year to allow more selective Jewish returns from Transnistria, including some 2,000 orphans.537538 After Transnistria's 1944 evacuation, Antonescu himself advocated the creation of new camps in Bessarabia.539 In conversations with his cabinet, the Conduc&lt;U+0103&gt;tor angrily maintained that surviving Jews were better off than Romanian soldiers.540
The policies applied in respect to the Romani population were ambivalent: while ordering the deportation of those he considered criminals, Ion Antonescu was taking some interest in improving the lives of Romani laborers of the B&lt;U+0103&gt;r&lt;U+0103&gt;gan Plain.541 According to Romanian historian Viorel Achim, although it had claimed the existence of a &quot;Gypsy problem&quot;, the Antonescu regime &quot;did not count it among its priorities.&quot;542 By 1943, Antonescu was gradually allowing those deported to return home. Initially, Constantin Vasiliu allowed the families of soldiers to appeal their deportation on a selective basis.543 Romanian authorities also appear to have been influenced by the objections of Nazi administrators in the Reichskommissariat Ukraine, who feared that the newly-arrived population would outnumber local Germans.544 By January 1944, the central authorities ordered local ones not to send back apprehended fugitives,545 instructed them to provide these with some food and clothing, and suggested corporal punishment for Romani people who did not adhere to a behavioral code.546 As the Romanian administrators abandoned Transnistria, most survivors from the group returned on their own in summer 1944.547
Antonescu and the Final Solution projects
Ion Antonescu and his subordinates were for long divided on the issue of the Final Solution, as applied in territories under direct Nazi control from 1941. At an early stage, German attempts to impose the RSHA's direct control over Old Kingdom Jews drew some objections from Mihai Antonescu, but the two sides agreed to a common policy in respect to Soviet Jews.548 In various of his early 1940s statements, Ion Antonescu favorably mentions the Axis goal of eliminating the Jewish presence in the event of victory.549 The unrestrained character of some Romanian measures in respect to the Jews alarmed Nazi officials, who demanded a methodical form of extermination.550 When confronted with German decisions to push back Jews he had expelled before the occupation of Transnistria, Antonescu protested, arguing that he had conformed with Hitler's decisions regarding &quot;eastern Jews&quot;.551 In August 1941, in preparation for the Final Solution's universal application, Hitler remarked: &quot;As for the Jewish question, today in any case one could say that a man like Antonescu, for example, proceeds much more radically in this manner than we have done until now. But I will not rest or be idle until we too have gone all the way with the Jews.&quot;552
By summer 1942, German representatives in Romania obtained Antonescu's approval for deporting the remaining Jewish population to extermination camps in occupied Poland.553554 Among those involved on the German side were mass murderer Adolf Eichmann and his aide Gustav Richter,555 while the Romanian side was represented by Jewish Affairs Commissioner Lecca (reporting to Antonescu himself).556 Richter directed Lecca in setting up the Central Jewish Office, which he assumed would function as a Judenrat to streamline extermination policies.557 According to such plans, only some 17,000 Jews, labeled useful to Romania's economy, were to be exempt.558559 The transports had already been announced to the Romanian Railways by autumn 1942, but the government eventually decided to indefinitely postpone these measures at the same time as most other deportations to Transnistria.560561 Antonescu's new orders on the matter were brought up in his conversations with Hitler at Schloss Klessheim, where both leaders show themselves aware of the fate awaiting Jewish deportees to Poland.562 By then, German authorities charged with the Final Solution's application in Eastern Europe completely abandoned their plans in respect to Romania.563
According to Oldson, by the final stage of the war Romania rejected &quot;all extreme measures against Jews who could not be proven to be communists.&quot;564 The planned transports to Palestine, prospects of which irritated Nazi German observers, implied a hope that Allied focus would shift from the regime's previous guilt and, at the same time, looked forward to the payments made in exchange for each person saved.565 The contrary implications of Romanian nationalism, manifested as reluctance over having to obey German commands and to drastic change in general, are occasionally offered as further explanations of the phenomenon.566 While reflecting upon the issue of emigration to Palestine, Antonescu also yielded to pleas of the Jewish community leaders, and allowed various Northern Transylvanian Jews fleeing the Holocaust in Hungary safe passage through Romania.567 He was doing the same for certain Northern Transylvanian Romani communities who had escaped southwards.568 In that context, Nazi German ideologues began objecting to Antonescu's supposed leniency.569 Antonescu nevertheless alternated tolerance of illegal immigration with drastic measures. In early 1944, he issued an order to shoot illegal immigrants, which was probably never enforced by the Border Police570 (who occasionally turned in Jewish refugees to the German authorities).571 The Antonescu regime allowed the extermination of the Romanian Jewish diaspora in other parts of Europe,572 formally opposing their deportation in some cases where it appeared Germany was impinging upon Romania's sovereignty.573
Opposition and political persecution
Political mainstream
 The circumstances of wartime accounted for cautious and ambivalent approaches to Antonescu's rule from among the Romanian political mainstream, which grouped advocates of liberal democracy and anti-fascism. According to Gledhill and King: &quot;Romanian liberals had been critical of their government warm relationship with Hitler, which had been developing throughout the 1930s, but the [1940] Soviet attack on Romanian territory left them with little chance but to support Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union.&quot;574 Other authors also cite the Greater Romanian agenda of the Antonescu executive as a reason behind the widespread acquiescence.575 The tendency was illustrated by Dinu Br&lt;U+0103&gt;tianu, who, in late January 1941, told his National Liberal colleagues that the new &quot;government of generals&quot; was &quot;the best solution possible to the current crisis&quot;, urging the group to provide Antonescu with &quot;all the support we can give him.&quot;576 An early point of contention between Antonescu and the National Peasants' Party came in spring 1941, when Antonescu's support for the Balkans Campaign and Romania's claim to parts of Vojvodina were met with a letter of protest from Iuliu Maniu, which Antonescu dismissed.577 Maniu and Br&lt;U+0103&gt;tianu also issued several condemnations of Antonescu's decision to continue the war beyond the Dniester.578 One such letter, signed by both, claimed that, while earlier steps had been &quot;legitimized by the entire soul of the nation, the Romanian people will never consent to the continuation of the struggle beyond our national borders.&quot;579 Maniu specifically mentioned the possibility of Allied victory, accused Antonescu of diverting attention from the goal of Greater Romania (Northern Transylvania included), and stressed that Romania's ongoing participation in the Axis was &quot;troubling enough&quot;.580
Antonescu is known to have publicly admonished opposition leaders for their disobedience, which he equated with obstruction,581 and to have monitored their activities through the Special Intelligence Service.582 However, some early communiques he addressed to Br&lt;U+0103&gt;tianu also feature offers of resignation, which their recipient reluctantly rejected.583 The Germans objected to such ambiguities, and Hitler once advised Antonescu to have Maniu killed, an option which the Conduc&lt;U+0103&gt;tor because of the PN&lt;U+0162&gt; leader's popularity with the peasants.584 While tolerating contacts between Maniu and the Allies, Antonescu arrested the clandestine British envoys to Romania, thus putting a stop to the 1943 Operation Autonomous.585 In parallel, his relationship with Queen Mother Helen and Michael rapidly deteriorated after he began advising the royal family on how to conduct its affairs.586 Voices of dissent regarding Antonescu's policies sometimes came from inside his own camp. Both the officer corps and the General Staff were divided on the issue of war beyond the Dniester, although it is possible that the majority agreed it would bring Northern Transylvania back to Romania.587 A prominent case was that of Iosif Iacobici, the Chief of the Romanian General Staff, whose objection to the massive transfer of Romanian troops on the Eastern Front resulted in his demotion and replacement with Ilie &lt;U+015E&gt;teflea (January 1942).588589 &lt;U+015E&gt;teflea issued similar calls, and Antonescu's eventually agreed to preserve a home army just before the Battle of Stalingrad.590 Various other military men extended their protection to persecuted Jews.591 Overall, Antonescu met significant challenges in exercising control over the politicized sectors in the armed forces.592
Antonescu's racial discrimination laws and Romania's participation in the Holocaust earned significant objections from various individuals and groups in Romanian society. One notorious opponent was Queen Mother Helen, who actively intervened to save Jews from being deported.593594 The Mayor of Cern&lt;U+0103&gt;u&lt;U+0163&gt;i, Traian Popovici, publicly objected to the deportation of Jews,595 as did Gherman P&lt;U+00E2&gt;ntea, his counterpart in Odessa.596 The appeals of Queen Helen, King Michael, the Orthodox Metropolitan of Transylvania Nicolae B&lt;U+0103&gt;lan, Apostolic Nuncio Andrea Cassulo and Swiss Ambassador Ren&lt;U+00E9&gt; de Weck are credited with having helped avert the Final Solution's application in Antonescu's Romania.597 Cassulo and B&lt;U+0103&gt;lan together pleaded for the fate of Jews, among them those who had converted to Christianity, and the former publicly protested against deportations.598 While Romania and the United States were still at peace, American Minister Plenipotentiary Franklin Mott Gunther repeatedly attempted to make his superiors aware of Romanian actions against the Jews,599 and Turkish diplomats unsuccessfully sought American approval for transferring Romanian Jews to safe passage through Anatolia and into Palestine.600 Dinu Br&lt;U+0103&gt;tianu also condemned antisemitic measures, prompting Antonescu to accuse him of being an ally of &quot;the Yid in London&quot;.601 Together with Maniu and Ion Mihalache, Br&lt;U+0103&gt;tianu signed statements condemning the isolation, persecution and expulsion of Jews, which prompted Antonescu to threaten a clampdown.602 However, both parties were occasionally ambiguous on racial issues, and themselves produced antisemitic messages.603 Br&lt;U+0103&gt;tianu is also known for publicly defending the cause of Romani people, opposing their deportation on grounds that it would &quot;turn back the clock on several centuries of history&quot;,604 a stance which drew support from his civilian peers.605 In parallel, some regular Romanians such as nurse Viorica Agarici intervened to save Jewish lives,606 while, from inside the Jewish community, Chief Rabbi Alexandru &lt;U+015E&gt;afran and activist Mi&lt;U+015F&gt;u Benvenisti rallied with Wilhelm Filderman in public protests against Antonescu's decisions, being occasionally joined by A. I. Zissu.607 In 1943, Filderman himself was deported to Mohyliv-Podilskyi, but eventually allowed to return.608
Political underground
 Organized resistance movements in Antonescu's Romania were comparatively small-scale and marginal. In addition to a Zionist underground which aided Jews to pass through or flee the country,609 the regime was confronted with local political movements of contrasting shades. One of them comprised far left and left-wing elements, which Antonescu's rise to power had caught in an unusual position. The minor Romanian Communist Party, outlawed since the rule of Ferdinand I for its Cominternist national policies, had been rendered virtually inactive by the German-Soviet non-aggression pact. Once reanimated by Operation Barbarossa, the PCR was unable to create an actual armed resistance movement, although it was able to coordinate the policies of several other small leftist groups.610 Speaking shortly before the invasion of the Soviet Union, and adopting the &quot;Jewish Bolshevism&quot; position, Antonescu ordered authorities to compile lists comprising &quot;the names of all Jewish and communist agents&quot;, who were to be kept under close surveillance.611 Among people arrested on suspicion of communism, Jews were sent to Transnistrian sites such as Vapniarka and R&lt;U+00EE&gt;bni&lt;U+0163&gt;a, while others were interned in regular facilities such as those in Caransebe&lt;U+015F&gt; and T&lt;U+00E2&gt;rgu Jiu.612 In all, some 2,000 Jewish Romanian deportees to the region had been accused of political crimes (the category also included those who had tried to escape forced labor).613 According to one estimate, people held on charges of being communists accounted for just under 2,000 people, of whom some 1,200 were jailed in Romania-proper.614 Capital punishment was used against various partisan-like activists,615 while the vast majority of communist prisoners in R&lt;U+00EE&gt;bni&lt;U+0163&gt;a were massacred in March 1944.616 At the other end of the political spectrum, after the Legionary Rebellion and the Iron Guard's decapitation, many Legionaries who opposed the regime, and whom Antonescu himself believed were &quot;communists in [Legionary] green shirts&quot;,617 were killed or imprisoned.618 An Iron Guardist underground was nevertheless formed locally, and probably numbered in thousands.619 Some of Antonescu's political prisoners from both camps were given a chance to redeem themselves by joining units on the Eastern Front.620
Although repressed, divided and weak, the PCR capitalized on the Soviet victories, being integrated into the mainstream opposition. In parallel, a &quot;prison faction&quot; emerged around Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, opposing both the formal leadership and the group of so-called &quot;Muscovite&quot; communists, who had taken refuge in the Soviet Union before the war.621 While maneuvering for control within the during and after 1944, &quot;prison&quot; communists destroyed a third group, formed around the PCR's nominal leader &lt;U+015E&gt;tefan Fori&lt;U+015F&gt; (whom they kidnapped and eventually killed).622 The PCR leadership was still suffering from a legitimacy crisis after beginning talks with the larger parties.623 The Soviets and &quot;Muscovite&quot; communists campaigned among Romanian prisoners of war in order to have them switch sides, and eventually managed to set up the Tudor Vladimirescu Division.624
Cultural circles
Measures enforced by the Ion Antonescu regime had contradictory effects on the Romanian cultural scene. According to Romanian literary historians Leti&lt;U+0163&gt;ia Guran and Alexandru &lt;U+015E&gt;tefan, &quot;the Antonescu regime [...] did not affect negatively cultural modernity. The Romanian cultural elite regarded Antonescu's policies for the most part with sympathy.&quot;625 Nevertheless, other researchers record the dissent of several cultural environments: the classic liberalism and cosmopolitanism of aging literary theorist Eugen Lovinescu, the &quot;Lovinescian&quot; Sibiu Literary Circle, and the rebellious counterculture of young avant-garde writers (Ion Caraion, Geo Dumitrescu, Dimitrie Stelaru, Constant Tonegaru).626 Prominent left-wing writers Tudor Arghezi, Victor Eftimiu and Zaharia Stancu were political prisoners during the Antonescu years.627 Author George C&lt;U+0103&gt;linescu also stood out against the official guidelines, and, in 1941, took a risk by publishing a synthesis of Romanian literature which emphasized Jewish contributions,628 while composer George Enescu pleaded with Antonescu personally for the fate of Romani musicians.629 Similar acts of solidarity were performed by various prominent intellectuals and artists.630 In August 1942, King Michael received a manifesto endorsed by intellectuals from various fields, deploring the murders in Transnistria, and calling for a realignment of policies.631 Another such document of April 1944 called for an immediate peace with the Soviet Union.632 On a more intimate level, a diary kept by philosopher and art critic Alice Voinescu expresses her indignation over the antisemitic measures and massacres.633
A special aspect of political repression and cultural hegemony was Antonescu's persecution of Evangelical or Restorationist Christian denominations, first outlawed under the National Legionary regime.634 Several thousand adherents of the Pentecostal Union and the Baptist Union were reportedly jailed in compliance with his orders.635 Persecution targeted groups of religiously-motivated conscientious objectors. In addition to the Inochentist movement, these groups included the Pentecostal Union, the Seventh-day Adventist Conference and the Jehovah's Witnesses Association.636 Antonescu himself recounted having contemplated using the death penalty against &quot;sects&quot; who would not allow military service, and ultimately deciding in favor of deporting &quot;recalcitrant&quot; ones.637
Legacy
Consequences of the Antonescu trial
The period following Antonescu's fall returned Romania to a democratic regime and the 1923 Constitution, as well as its participation in the war alongside the Allies. However, it also saw the early stages of a communist takeover&lt;U+2014&gt;which culminated with King Michael's forced abdication on December 30, 1947 and the subsequent establishment of Communist Romania. The Antonescu trial thus fit into a long series of similar procedures and political purges on charges of collaborationism, instrumented by the Romanian People's Tribunals and various other institutions.638 During the rigged general election of 1946 and for years after Ion Antonescu's execution, the Romanian Communist Party and its allies began using the implications of his trial as an abusive means of compromising some of their political opponents.639640 One such early example was Iuliu Maniu, by then one of the country's prominent anti-communists, who was accused of being a fascist and an Antonescu sympathizer, mainly for having shaken his hand during the trial.641 The enlistment of ethnic Germans into Nazi German units, as approved by Antonescu, was used as a pretext for the community's Soviet-led expulsion.642643 On similar grounds, the Soviet occupation forces organized the capture of Romanian citizens, together with the return of war refugees from Romania-proper into Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina, both of which often culminated into deportations further inland.644 As part of its deteriorating relationship with Romanian Roman Catholics, and urged on by the Soviets, the communist cabinet of Petru Groza also deemed Apostolic Nuncio Andrea Cassulo a collaborator of Antonescu and a persona non grata, based on transcripts of the Cassulo-Antonescu conversations.645 It also used such allegations to pressure several Greek-Catholic clergymen into accepting union with the Romanian Orthodox Church.646
Nevertheless, Romanian-born Holocaust historian Radu Ioanid notes, few of Romanians involved in organizing the Holocaust were prosecuted, and, of those, none were executed after the Antonescu trial. He attributes this to nationalist resistance within the administrative and judicial apparatus, to communist fears of alienating a too large number of people, to the emigration of Zionist survivors, and to the open hostility of some communists toward liberal Jewish community leaders.647 The conflict with the new authorities and the majority population is also described by other researchers.648 Sporadic trials for Holocaust-related crimes still occurred, including one of Maria Antonescu. Arrested in September 1944 and spending the 1945-1946 interval in Soviet custody, she was re-arrested at home in 1950, tried and ultimately found guilty of economic crimes for her collaboration with the Central Jewish Office.649 Five years later, she was sent into internal exile, and died of heart problems in 1964.650 A large number of convicted war criminals, even some sentenced to life imprisonment, were deemed fit for social cohabitation and released after 1950, while some suspects were never prosecuted.651
In communist historiography
Although isolated mentions of the Holocaust were made in the Marxist analytical works of the increasingly marginalized communist figure Lucre&lt;U+0163&gt;iu P&lt;U+0103&gt;tr&lt;U+0103&gt;&lt;U+015F&gt;canu,652 the heavily-politicized official discourse inspired by Soviet historiography provided an interpretation of Romania's wartime evolution exclusively based on Marxism-Leninism and its idea of class conflict.653 In this context, the main effort for documenting and exposing the Antonescu-era massacres came from among Jewish Romanians. This began in 1945, when Jewish journalists Marius Mircu and Maier Rudrich contributed first-hand testimonies.654 In 1946-1948, the Jewish community leader Matatias Carp published Cartea neagr&lt;U+0103&gt; (&quot;The Black Book&quot;), a voluminous and detailed account of all stages of the Holocaust.655 After forming a secondary element in Antonescu's indictment, the deportation of Romani people was largely ignored in official discourse.656
The communist regime overemphasized the part played by the PCR in the August 23 Coup, while commemorating it as a national holiday.657658 The Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej faction, which emerged as winner of the interior PCR struggles and incorporated nationalist discourse, claimed to have had a decisive role in Antonescu's toppling, even though a majority of its members had been jailed for most of the period.659 In accordance with Stalinist principles, censored produced historical revisionism, which excluded focus from negative aspects such as antisemitism and the Holocaust,660 while obscuring Romania's participation on the Eastern Front.661 Beginning in the mid 1960s, when Nicolae Ceau&lt;U+015F&gt;escu took power and embarked on a national communist course, this was accompanied by a contradictory tendency, which implied a gradual rehabilitation of Antonescu and his regime.662 The revival of nationalist tenets and the relative distance taken from Soviet policies are believed to have contributed to this process.663 After a period of liberalization, the increasingly authoritarian Ceau&lt;U+015F&gt;escu regime revived the established patterns of personalized rule, and even made informal use of the Conduc&lt;U+0103&gt;tor title.664 Beginning in the early 1970s, when the new policies were consecrated by the July Theses, Ceau&lt;U+015F&gt;escu tolerated a nationalist, antisemitic and Holocaust denialist intellectual faction, illustrated foremost by S&lt;U+0103&gt;pt&lt;U+0103&gt;m&lt;U+00EE&gt;na and Luceaf&lt;U+0103&gt;rul magazines of Eugen Barbu and Corneliu Vadim Tudor, by poet Adrian P&lt;U+0103&gt;unescu and his Flac&lt;U+0103&gt;ra journal, and by novelist Ion L&lt;U+0103&gt;ncr&lt;U+0103&gt;njan.665 The regime also came to cultivate a relationship with exiled tycoon Iosif Constantin Dr&lt;U+0103&gt;gan, a former Iron Guard member who had come to endorse both Antonescu's rehabilitation and the national communist version of Protochronism.666 In contrast, much of dissident culture and the Romanian diaspora embraced the image of Michael I as a counterpart to the Antonescu myth.667 Lucian Boia described this as &quot;the spectacular confrontation between the two contradictory myths [transposing] into historical and mythological terms a fundamental fissure which divides the Romanian society of today.&quot;668
Topics relating to the Holocaust in Romania were distorted during the national communist stage. Ceau&lt;U+015F&gt;escu himself mentioned the number of deportations survivors (some 50,000 people) as a total number of victims, failed to mention the victims' ethnic background, and presented most of them as &quot;communists and antifascists.&quot;669 The regime also placed emphasis on the Holocaust in Northern Transylvania (where the Final Solution had been applied by the Germans and the local Arrow Cross Party).670 Earlier accounts of the massacres, which had already been placed under restricted use, were completely removed from public libraries.671 While a special politicized literature dealt with the Holocaust in Hungary, the entire Ceau&lt;U+015F&gt;escu period produced only one work entirely dedicated to Romania's participation.672 Centered on the Ia&lt;U+015F&gt;i pogrom, it shifted the blame from Romanian authorities and advanced a drastically reduced death toll.673 In its preface, official historian Nicolae Minei claimed that Romania was not responsible for any deaths among Jewish persons.674 Other official texts made more radical claims, openly denying that Antonescu's regime was antisemitic, and that all those killed were victims of Germany or circumstance.675
Debates of the 1990s
Several shifts occurred in Antonescu's image after the 1989 Revolution which toppled communism. Polls carried out in the 1990s show the Conduc&lt;U+0103&gt;tor was well-liked by portions of the general public.676 This tendency, Lucian Boia argues, was similar to a parallel trend favoring Wallachia's 15th century Prince Vlad III the Impaler, indicating both a preference for &quot;authoritarian solutions&quot; and &quot;a pantheon that was largely set in place in the 'Ceau&lt;U+015F&gt;escu era' &quot;.677 An attitude which saw the 1944 Coup as exclusively the onset of communization in Romania also achieved popularity at the time,678679 while certain sections of the public opinion revived the notion of &quot;Jewish Bolshevism&quot;, accusing Jews of having brought communism to Romania.680 Such reflexes were placed by British historian Tony Judt in connection with growing anti-Russian sentiment and Holocaust denial in various countries of the former Eastern Bloc, and collectively termed &quot;mis-memory of anti-communism&quot;.681 Vladimir Tism&lt;U+0103&gt;neanu, a prominent Romanian-born political scientist, referred to Antonescu's &quot;pseudo-sacred&quot; image with the post-1989 public, and to the phenomenon as &quot;fantasies of persecution.&quot;682 The wartime dictator's image appealed to many politicians of the post-1989 period, and sporadic calls for his rehabilitation were issued at the highest levels of authority.683684685 Far right groups issued calls for his canonization by the Romanian Orthodox Church (together with a similar request made in the name of Corneliu Zelea Codreanu).686 Among the neofascist groups, those who claim to represent the legacy of Codrenism and argue Sima was a deviationist have also become Antonescu apologists.687
A particular case in the process was that of forces gathered around the Greater Romania Party, a group often characterized as merging xenophobic or neofascist messages and the legacy of Ceau&lt;U+015F&gt;escu's national communism.688 Founded by party leader and former S&lt;U+0103&gt;pt&lt;U+0103&gt;m&lt;U+00EE&gt;na contributor Vadim Tudor, Rom&lt;U+00E2&gt;nia Mare magazine is known to have equated Antonescu and Ceau&lt;U+015F&gt;escu, presenting them both as &quot;apostles of the Romanian people&quot;.689 In his bid for the office of President during the 1996 election, Vadim Tudor vowed to be a new Antonescu.690 Boia remarks this meeting of extremes offers an &quot;extraordinary paradox&quot;.691 Dr&lt;U+0103&gt;gan also openly resumed his activities in Romania, often in collaboration with Vadim Tudor's group,692 founding three organizations tasked with campaigning for Antonescu's rehabilitation: the media outlet Europa Nova,693 the Ion Antonescu Foundation and the Ion Antonescu League.694 His colleague Radu Theodoru, endorsed such projects while accusing Jews of being &quot;a long-term noxious factor&quot; and claiming that it was actually Romanians who were victims of a communist Holocaust.695 Radical claims deflecting blame from the crimes on the Jews themselves, and relying on fabricated evidence, were notably produced by Ion Coja and Paul Goma.696 Arguments in favor of Antonescu's rehabilitation, accompanied by xenophobic claims, were repeatedly made by several journals edited by Ion Cristoiu,697 and were sporadically present in national dailies of various hues, such as Ziua, Rom&lt;U+00E2&gt;nia Liber&lt;U+0103&gt;698 and Adev&lt;U+0103&gt;rul.699
Various researchers argue that the overall tendency was endorsed by the ruling National Salvation Front and its successor group, later known as Social Democratic Party,700 who complimented emerging pro-authoritarian lobby while depicting their common opponent King Michael and his supporters as traitors.701 Sections of both governing and opposition groups contemplated the idea of rehabilitating the wartime leader, and, in May 1991, Parliament observed a moment of silence in his memory.702 The perceived government tolerance of Antonescu's promotion raised concern and protests at an international level.703704 Political recognition of Antonescu's complicity was first expressed in 1997 by Romanian President Emil Constantinescu, a representative of the Democratic Convention.705 Nevertheless, during the same period, Attorney General Sorin Moisescu followed a since-deprecated special appeal procedure to overturn sentences passed against Antonescu and other 1946 defendants, but eventually withdrew it.706
To a certain degree, such pro-Antonescu approaches were also present in the post-1989 historiographic school. Reflecting back on this phenomenon in 2004, Maria Bucur wrote: &quot;the perverse image of Antonescu is not the product of a propaganda campaign led by right-wing extremists, but a pervasive myth fed by historical debates and political contests, and which the public seems indifferent to or accepts unproblematically.&quot;707 After the Revolution, archival sources concerning Ion Antonescu, including those in the National Archives of Romania, were made more available to researchers, but documents confiscated or complied by Soviet officials, kept in Russia, remained largely inaccessible.708 Although confronted with more evidence from the newly-opened archives, several historians, including some employed by official institutions, continued to deny the Holocaust in Romania, and attributed the death toll exclusively to German units.709 In parallel, the exclusive focus on Northern Transylvanian massacres remained an observable trend.710 Local authors who have actively promoted Antonescu's image as a hero and wrote apologetic accounts of his politics include historians Gheorghe Buzatu711 and Mihai Pelin,712 and researcher Alex Mihai Stoenescu.713 A similarly controversial monograph was published in the United States by Larry L. Watts.714 Although criticized for denying the uniqueness of the Holocaust and downplaying Antonescu's complicity, Dinu C. Giurescu was recognized as the first post-communist Romanian historian to openly acknowledge his country's participation,715 while his colleagues &lt;U+015E&gt;erban Papacostea and Andrei Pippidi were noted as early critics of attempts to exculpate Antonescu.716 The matter of crimes in Transnistria and elsewhere was first included within the Romanian curriculum with a 1999 state-approved alternative textbook edited by Sorin Mitu.717
Wiesel Commission and aftermath

In 2003, after a period in which his own equivocal stance on the matter had drawn controversy,718 Constantinescu's successor Ion Iliescu established the Wiesel Commission, an international scientific body whose mission was the study of the Holocaust in Romania, later succeeded by the Elie Wiesel National Institute. The Final Report compiled by the Commission brought the official recognition of Ion Antonescu's participation in the Holocaust.719720721 After that moment, public displays of support for Antonescu became illegal.722723724 Antonescu's SMERSH interrogations were recovered from the Russian archives and published in 2006.725 Despite the renewed condemnation and exposure, Antonescu remained a popular figure: as a result of the 2006 Mari Rom&lt;U+00E2&gt;ni series of polls conducted by the national station TVR 1, viewers nominated Antonescu as the 6th greatest Romanian ever.726 The vote's knockout phase included televised profiles of the ten most popular figures, and saw historian Adrian Cioroianu using the portion dedicated to Antonescu for his exposure and condemnation, giving voters reasons not to see the dictator as a great Romanian.727 The approach resulted in notable controversy after Ziua newspaper criticized Cioroianu, who defended himself by stating he had an obligation to tell the truth.728
The same year, on December 5, the Bucharest Court of Appeals overturned Antonescu's conviction for certain crimes against peace, on the grounds that the objective conditions of 1940 justified a preventive war against the Soviet Union, which would make Article 3 of the 1933 Convention for the Definition of Aggression inapplicable in his case729730731 (as well as in those of Alexianu, Constantin Pantazi, Constantin Vasiliu, Sima and various Iron Guard politicians).732 This act raised official protests in Moldova, the independent state formed in Bessarabia upon the breakup of the Soviet Union, and in Russia, the Soviet successor state, as well as criticism by historians of the Holocaust.733734735 The Court of Appeals decision was overturned by the Romanian Supreme Court in May 2008.736 The same year, Maria Antonescu's collateral inheritors advanced a claim on a Predeal villa belonging to the couple, but a Bra&lt;U+015F&gt;ov tribunal rejected their request, citing laws which confiscated the property of war criminals.737
Cultural legacy, portrayals and landmarks
Beyond their propaganda and censorship efforts, Antonescu and his regime had a sizable impact on Romanian culture, art and literature. Owing to guidelines and circumstances, the direct imprint is however reduced in comparison to other periods in the country's history. A general characteristic of the war years was the abandonment of large heroes' memorials, and works of this nature produced at the time were mainly roadside triptychs (troi&lt;U+0163&gt;e).738 A proposal to raise a major monument of this category in place of Bucharest's Jewish cemetery, for which the Heroes' Cult organization had received expropriation rights in 1942, was eventually abandoned.739 Antonescu and his wife preferred donating to Orthodox churches, and were ktitors of three churches in separate Bucharest areas: M&lt;U+0103&gt;rgeanului Church in Rahova, one in D&lt;U+0103&gt;m&lt;U+0103&gt;roaia, and the Saints Constantine and Helena Church in Muncii, where both the Marshal and his wife are depicted in a mural.740 After floods took a toll on his native Arge&lt;U+015F&gt; County, the Marshal himself established Antone&lt;U+015F&gt;ti, a model village in Corbeni (partly built by Ukrainian prisoners of war, and later passed into state property), while ordering the Arge&lt;U+015F&gt; River's hydroelectric exploitation.741 He also had sporadic contacts with the artistic and literary environment, including an interview he awarded to his supporter, writer Ioan Alexandru Br&lt;U+0103&gt;tescu-Voine&lt;U+015F&gt;ti.742 His 1946 trial was notably attended and documented by George C&lt;U+0103&gt;linescu in a series of articles for Na&lt;U+0163&gt;iunea journal.743 Political humor of the 1940s preserved distinct images of the Romanian leader. Romanian jokes circulated under Antonescu's rule ridiculed his adoption of the Marshal of Romania title, viewing it as a self-promotion and dubbing him the &quot;Auto-Marshal&quot;.744 During the war, Soviet agitprop portrayed Antonescu and the other secondary Axis leaders as villains and servile dog-like creatures, representations notably present in musical theater and puppetry shows,745 as well as in press cartoons.746
A consequence of the Ceau&lt;U+015F&gt;escu regime's ambiguous relationship with Antonescu was Delirul, a novel written by Marin Preda in 1975. Critics John Neubauer and Marcel Cornis-Pope remark that the novel is &quot;admittedly not [Preda's] best work&quot;, and discuss Antonescu's &quot;complex representation&quot; as &quot;an essentially flawed but active leader who tried to negotiate some maneuvering room between the demands of Germany and the threats of the Soviet Union [and whose failure] led to the dismantling of Romania's fragile democratic system.&quot;747 The book sought Antonescu's rehabilitation for his attitudes on the Bessarabia-Northern Bukovina issue, but did not include any mention of his antisemitic policies, which Preda himself may have ignored.748 An international scandal followed once negative comments on the book were published by the Soviet magazine Literaturnaya Gazeta.749 Although an outspoken nationalist, Eugen Barbu produced a satirical image of Antonescu in his own 1975 novel, Incognito, the end result of which was described by Deletant as &quot;character assassination&quot;.750
During the 1990s, monuments to Antonescu were raised and streets were named after him in Bucharest, and several other cities.751752 Among those directly involved in this process were Iosif Constantin Dr&lt;U+0103&gt;gan,753754 the nationalist Mayor of Cluj-Napoca, Gheorghe Funar,755 and General Mircea Chelaru, whose resignation from the Army was subsequently requested and obtained.756 Also during that interval, in 1993, filmmaker and Social Democratic politician Sergiu Nicolaescu produced Oglinda, in which Antonescu, played by Ion Siminie, is the subject of an apologetic depiction.757 The rehabilitation trend was also represented at an October 1994 commemorative exhibit at the National Military Museum.758 The same year, a denialist documentary film, Destinul mare&lt;U+015F&gt;alului (&quot;The Marshal's Destiny&quot;), was distributed by state-owned companies, a matter which raised concern.759 As the Wiesel Commission presented its findings and such public endorsement was outlawed, statues in Antonescu's likeness were torn down or otherwise made unavailable for public viewing.760761762763 An unusual case is that of his Saints Constantine and Helena Church, where, after lengthy debates,764 his bust was sealed inside a metal box.765766 Outside of this context, the publicized display of Antonescu's portraits and racist slogans by football hooligans during Liga I's 2005-2006 season prompted UEFA intervention (see Racism Breaks the Game).767

According to Achim (p.167-170, 179, 182-183, 185) and Deletant (p.189-190), the measures reflected Antonescu's views on &quot;social problems&quot; more than a racist perspective. However, Kelso (p.99-100) believes the report was a notable factor in the decision to deport the Romani people.↩

In February 1943, Romanian officials announced to the world that they were going to allow &quot;70,000 Jews&quot; departure from Transnistria to Palestine on ships with Vatican insignia, in exchange for payments. The project was sabotaged by the Nazis, reportedly upon the request of Mohammad Amin al-Husayni, the fugitive Grand Mufti of Jerusalem. Antonescu later approached the Red Cross for similar transfer efforts, including the ill-fated ship Mefkure. (Penkower, p.148, 153-155, 157. See also Deletant, p.213-218).↩
