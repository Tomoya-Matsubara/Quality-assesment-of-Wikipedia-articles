Nine Inch Nails is an American industrial rock act, founded in 1988 by Trent Reznor in Cleveland, Ohio. Nine Inch Nails live performances contrast with its in-studio counterpart:12 although Reznor is in complete creative control of Nine Inch Nails in-studio, he has typically assembled groups of backing musicians to interpret songs for tours and other live performances. The live-band lineup has changed consistently throughout the band's history, with Reznor remaining the only constant on vocals and lead guitar. Notable musicians who have contributed to live performances include Richard Patrick, Chris Vrenna, Jeordie White, Robin Finck, Josh Freese, Aaron North, Alessandro Cortini, Justin Meldal-Johnson, Jerome Dillon, Jeordie White,Charlie Clouser, Danny Lohner, Jeff Ward, and James Woolley.
The configuration of the Nine Inch Nails as a live-band has evolved since first touring in 1988. Early incarnations of the band featured three people playing guitar, drums, keyboards, and samplers.3 Later incarnations replaced the keyboards and samplers with an additional guitarist, and further incarnations added a bass guitarist.4 Finally, the live component of Nine Inch Nails has settled as a five-piece band since the Self Destruct tour in 1994.5 In September 2007, Reznor expressed his interest in moving away from the &quot;rock band configuration&quot; to explore &quot;other ways [to] present the material in concert&quot;,6 though once again the 2008 incarnation consists of five positions.
Between major tours, live band members have on occasion contributed instrumental performances to official Nine Inch Nails releases, though creative control and direction has always been the responsibility of Reznor. Nine Inch Nails has released one album and three videos featuring the live band: Closure (1997), a double-VHS set featuring live performances from the Self-Destruct tour; And All That Could Have Been (2000), released in CD and DVD formats featuring performances from the Fragility tour; and Beside You in Time (2007), a DVD featuring performances from the Live: With Teeth tour.
