Canada Cup Trophy

Following the exciting 1972 Summit Series between Canada and the Soviet Union, interest in a world professional ice hockey championship increased substantially. The Canada Cup would bring together the top hockey-playing countries in the world.
It was held in 1976, 1981, 1984, 1987 and 1991. It featured competition between teams representing Canada, Czechoslovakia, Finland, the Soviet Union, Sweden, the United States, and (in 1984 only, taking the place of Finland) West Germany. All the tournaments were won by Canada except the 1981 tournament, which was won by the Soviet Union. The 1987 event is often called one of the most spectacular in hockey history as #99 Wayne Gretzky and #66 Mario Lemieux combined forces to capture the Canada Cup at Copps Coliseum as Team Canada defeated the Soviets. Canada won that series 2 games to one and all three games ended in 6-to-5 scores. 1 The 1987 and 1991 finals were both held in Hamilton, Ontario. 2

Trivia

Alan Eagleson came up with the ideal for the Canada Cup in 1966 after watching the FIFA World Cup final on TV. He said to himself, &quot;if they can do a World Cup for soccer then why not a World Cup for hockey as well?&quot;
The 1981 win by the USSR caused controversy when Canadian officials announced that the trophy would not actually go home with the winning team. A group of Canadian fans, feeling this was unsportsmanlike, raised money to produce a duplicate trophy to give to the Soviet team.
Every player from the USSR's 1984 Canada Cup team was a left-handed shooter.
