The Desert Column was a British Empire army corps which operated in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign of the First World War. The column had been formed in December 1916,1 under the command of Lieutenant General Philip W. Chetwode as part of Eastern Force commanded by Lieutenant General C. M. Dobell, part of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force commanded by General A. J. Murray. In mid 1917 when General Edmund Allenby took command of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force, Desert Column was reformed and renamed to become the Desert Mounted Corps commanded by Lieutenant General Henry G. Chauvel.
Chetwode was appointed on 7 December 1916 to command a force composed of the 42nd (East Lancashire) Division, the 52nd (Lowland) Division, the Anzac Mounted Division and the Imperial Camel Brigade composed of eighteen companies, six of which were yeomen.2 Chetwode arrived El Arish to take up his appointment on 22 December 1916.34
