&quot;Bring The Light&quot; is a song from The Smashing Pumpkins' 2007 album, Zeitgeist.
&quot;Bring the Light&quot; features the well-known rock sound of the Pumpkins, with a somewhat over-the-top sensibility (namely, heavy vocal overdubs and a double, harmonized guitar solo). It also features heavy use of palm muting. The song's sensibility is largely thanks to producer Roy Thomas Baker.1
The song was conspicuously absent from the Pumpkins' summer 2007 tour, but was debuted in the North American leg on September 13, 2007 at the Pearl Theater in Las Vegas. The song's doubled, harmonized guitar solo was replicated by both Corgan and second guitarist Jeff Schroeder, producing a dual lead sound rare for the band. The song has since been added to the regular setlist and has been well-received.
Though it has not been released as a single, it has fared better than the official second single from the album, &quot;That's the Way (My Love Is)&quot;, in certain quarters, peaking at number 5 in Peru. It has also enjoyed airplay in Brazil and Argentina, and on K-ROCK, KROQ, and Ethel, peaking at #277 on the U.S Modern Rock charts in early November. 2
