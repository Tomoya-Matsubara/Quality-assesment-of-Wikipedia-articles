Pure is a compilation album by pop band The Lightning Seeds, released in 1996 and reaching #27 in the UK Albums Chart.1
The first of what would turn out to be five compilations the band released from 1996 to 2006, Pure is almost a reissue rather than a compilation, since it consists of all but three of the songs released by the band on their first two albums, Cloudcuckooland from 1990 and Sense from 1992; the only songs missing are one song from the first album (&quot;Control the Flame&quot;) and two from Sense: (&quot;Where Flowers Fade&quot; and &quot;Marooned&quot;).2
