&quot;Cowboys Are Frequently, Secretly Fond of Each Other&quot; (1981) is &quot;the famous gay cowboy song&quot; 1 by Latin country musician Ned Sublette whose music features a &quot;lilting West Texas waltz feel&quot; 2 and whose lyrics satirize the stereotypes associated with cowboys and gay men. For example: &quot;What did you think all them saddles and boots was about?&quot; (a reference to western wear and leather subculture)
Country musician Willie Nelson's cover (iTunes single February 14, 2006) is the first gay-themed mainstream country song by a major artist 3. The song has also been recorded and released by Sublette (GPS 027: Life is a Killer 1982), Canadian alternative country band Lost Dakotas (Sun Machine, 1992), queercore band Pansy Division (Lookout 110: Pile Up 1995), and folk duo Rick &amp; Andy (Going Places 2005).
Composition
Sublette says the song is based on his experiences growing up in Portales, N.M. 4: &quot;I sat down at the piano and... remembered what it felt like to feel different as a teenager, and the culture at that time, and I started to put those two things together and the song wrote itself&quot; 5. The song was written during the Urban Cowboy fad 6 while living with his wife in Manhattan next to a gay country bar on Christopher Street called Boots and Saddles. He explains &quot;Gay life in 1981 was very vibrant in those days. It was part of the culture of the city and cowboy imagery is a part of gay iconography.&quot; He wrote the song with Nelson's voice in mind: &quot;I was at the beginning of my songwriting career... and used to like writing songs for my favorite voices. I've been a Willie fan since the '60s.&quot; 7
As stated above, Sublette is acquainted with gay culture and the song is gay-friendly despite what Ann Northrop of Gay USA describes as &quot;the language of thirty years ago&quot; such as &quot;Well small town don't like it when somebody falls between sexes&quot; and &quot;Well I believe in my soul that inside every man there's a feminine, / And inside every lady there's a deep manly voice loud and clear&quot; which display now marginal views about gender and sexuality (see Havelock Ellis' Sexual Inversion). However, positive lyrics such as &quot;A cowboy may brag about things that he does with his women, / But the ones who brag loudest are the ones that are most likely queer&quot; include criticisms of the closet and small town bigotry.
Nelson's version
Nelson received a tape of the song from Saturday Night Live Band bassist Tony Garnier after performing on the show 8 in the mid to late 1980s and according to the latter &quot;Willie took if from there&quot; 9 though Nelson recently found that demo in a drawer among a stack of his own while recording unreleased songs for iTunes 10. Nelson says &quot;I thought it was the funniest goddamn song I'd ever heard. I had it on the bus for 20 years, and people would come in and I'd play it. When Brokeback come out, it just seemed like a good time to kick it out of the closet&quot; 11.
Filming for the video featuring Broken Lizard Comedy Troupe 12, expected this Spring, occurred at Dallas' gay cowboy bar, the Round Up Saloon (in the predominately gay Oak Lawn neighborhood of Dallas), in February. Nelson's publicist describes the release of the song, which debuted on Howard Stern's satellite radio show: &quot;Since everyone is talking about the acclaimed film Brokeback Mountain and its Academy Award nominations, Valentine's Day seemed like the right time to let [the song] be heard.&quot; Nelson appeared on the movie's soundtrack with the traditional &quot;He Was A Friend Of Mine&quot; also covered by The Byrds. 13
Nelson himself described the release in a prepared statement: &quot;The song's been in the closet for 20 years. The timing's right for it to come out. I'm just opening the door.&quot; The song's coming out was encouraged by the coming out of his friend and tour manager of thirty years, David Anderson, two years ago. Says Anderson: &quot;This song obviously has special meaning to me in more ways than one. I want people to know more than anything &lt;U+2014&gt; gay, straight, whatever &lt;U+2014&gt; just how cool Willie is and ... his way of thinking, his tolerance, everything about him.&quot; 14
Reception
Nelson's version of the song is his highest charting single since 1984's duet with Julio Iglesias &quot;To All the Girls I've Loved Before&quot; (No. 5) 15 and has been well received by critics, such as Pitchfork Media's Stephen M. Deusner who rated the song four out of four stars despite calling it &quot;even more of a stunt than his reggae album&quot; (2005's Countryman). He also says that the song sounds as if it was written by Nelson and that his performance raises the piece above the level of a cheap gag while adding &quot;a whole new level of complexity to the outlaw mythology Willie helped to cultivate in the 70s.&quot; 16.
Nelson also says that he has received very little negative reactions: &quot;Every now and then somebody might get a little offended. It's got bad language in it, so I just don't do it in my shows. Anybody wants to hear it can hear it on iTunes. But you know people are listenin' to it, likin' it. Every now and then somebody don't like it, but that's okay. Similar to years ago, when the hippie thing come out and I started growin' my hair and puttin' the earring in, I got a little flak here and there&quot; 17.
However, most sources 18 19 speculate about the potential success and reception of the song. Nelson explains that he didn't think &quot;it took a lot of balls to put the song out&quot; saying &quot;first of all, I didn't think anybody would play it. I didn't think it would get on the air, but sure enough it did&quot; though not on country stations: &quot;Oh no, they're not gonna play it&quot; 20.
Sublette, as expected, approves of Nelson's cover, described variously as deadpan 21 22, straight-faced 23, and pointedly poignant 24, and its exposure saying that &quot;It's supposed to be funny, that's what gets people's attention, but to get people to listen to it a second time [you] have to have something going on, and Willie beautifully brought out the tenderness there...[It's] nice to have a funny song out there -- it is challenging people to laugh. Everybody is so angry now.&quot; Sublette speculated about the song's reception: &quot;Willie's smart. We talked about recording it in the '90s but we needed some kind of context. It wouldn't make sense to just put this on some normal Willie album...The movie provided the context. I don't know if the public is any more or less ready than they were but I think the media is more ready.&quot; 25
The song was featured in a Boondocks comic strip on February 27th and 28th (1) and mentioned till the 2nd of March. According to Sublette &quot;the Monday and Tuesday strip consisted of my lyrics and dramatizing listeners' response to my lyrics. What a compliment!&quot; 26
Similar songs
The song may be compared with the reception of Garth Brooks' pro-peace 1992 single &quot;We Shall be Free&quot;. The song's single pro-gay line &quot;when we're free to love anyone we choose&quot; caused some radio stations to refuse to play the song, contributing to its peak at No. 12 on Billboard's country singles chart and marking the end of Brooks' string of top ten hits. 27
Dolly Parton recorded &quot;Travelin' Thru&quot; for a transgender themed film Transamerica (2005), and the song was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song and was considered the front-runner in the 2005 Oscar song category. &quot;Travelin' Thru&quot; did win as Best Original Song award at the Phoenix Film Critics Society Awards 2005. The song was also nominated, though it did not win, for both Best Original Song by the Foreign Press' for the Golden Globes as well as Best Song by the Broadcast Film Critics Association. However, the difference in subject and visibility between the films lessens the usefulness of this comparison.
