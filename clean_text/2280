History
Early years (1991&lt;U+2013&gt;1998)
In 1991, friends Marcos Curiel and Wuv Bernardo engaged in jam sessions, with Marcos covering guitar and Wuv playing the drums with no vocalist.11 Calling themselves Eschatos, they started playing at keg parties doing Metallica and Slayer cover songs. After his mother's fatal illness, Sonny Sandoval converted to Christianity and was asked by his cousin, Wuv Bernardo, to join the band as a way to keep his mind straight as mentioned on their DVD, Still Payin' Dues. They got a bass player, Gabe Portillo, and eventually changed their name to P.O.D. After recording a demo tape, Traa Daniels joined the band in 1994 when they needed a bassist for some shows to replace Gabe. P.O.D. signed with Rescue Records, a label created by Wuv's father. Between 1994 and 1997, they released three albums under the label, Snuff the Punk, Brown and Payable on Death Live.12
Shortly after the release of Payable on Death Live, Essential Records offered P.O.D. a $100,000 recording contract, but Sonny Sandoval spoke for them all when he politely but firmly told band manager Tim Cook to decline the offer because, &lt;U+201C&gt;God has a bigger plan for P.O.D.&lt;U+201D&gt;13 In 1998, A&amp;R rep John Rubeli from Atlantic Records caught a show at The Roxy on the Sunset Strip, and the band was quickly signed to a major-label deal.14 P.O.D. soon released The Warriors EP, a tribute EP to their loyal fans as a transitional album from Rescue Records to Atlantic Records.
Mainstream success (1999&lt;U+2013&gt;2002)
P.O.D.'s third studio album, 1999's The Fundamental Elements of Southtown, spawned the hits &quot;Southtown&quot; and Total Request Live favorite &quot;Rock the Party (Off the Hook)&quot;, which became their first video to reach #1 on MTV's TRL (Total Request Live).15 At a time after the 1999 album, &quot;School of Hard Knocks&quot; was featured on the soundtrack for Little Nicky while both &quot;Southtown&quot; and &quot;Rock the Party (Off the Hook)&quot; appeared in the movie. All three music videos endured heavy play on MTV2 and the songs were rock radio hits. The album went on to become RIAA certified platinum.16
On the 11th September 2001 P.O.D. released their fourth studio album, Satellite. The album's first single, &quot;Alive&quot;, went on to become one of MTV's and MTV2's top played videos of the year. The video's popularity, as well as the song's positive message, helped the song become a huge modern rock radio hit and it was Grammy nominated for Best Hard Rock Performance in 2002.
The album's second single, &quot;Youth of the Nation&quot;, was influenced in part by the school shootings at Santana High School, Columbine High School, and Granite Hills High School. It was Grammy nominated for Best Hard Rock Performance in 2003. The 2002 singles, &quot;Boom&quot; and &quot;Satellite&quot;, also became quite popular. In addition, the concluding track of the album, &quot;Portrait,&quot; was Grammy nominated for Best Metal Performance in 2003. Satellite went on to become RIAA-certified triple platinum.17 The author of Encyclopedia of Contemporary Christian Music has described P.O.D. as &quot;One of the biggest success stories in recent Christian music.&quot;18
Line-up and label changes (2003&lt;U+2013&gt;2006)
On February 19, 2003, guitarist Marcos Curiel left the band due to his side project, The Accident Experiment and &quot;spiritual differences.&quot; However, Marcos argued that he was actually kicked out of the band.1920 Sonny, Wuv and Traa were devastated about Curiel leaving, they considered breaking up the band, but decided to stay together and recruit another guitarist.21 Curiel was replaced by Jason Truby, former member of Christian metal band Living Sacrifice, and assisted with the recording of &quot;Sleeping Awake&quot;, from The Matrix Reloaded soundtrack. In an interview with Yahoo! Music, Sonny stated that Jason is the reason why the group is still together.22
On November 4, 2003, P.O.D. released their fifth studio album, Payable on Death, which saw the group shift from their well known rapcore sound to a darker, more melodic metal sound.23 The album was hit with controversy due to its &quot;occult&quot; cover, which led as many as 85% of Christian bookstores across the United States to ban the album.24 With the help of the album's hit single &quot;Will You&quot; and &quot;Change the World&quot;, it went on to sell over 520,000 copies and was certified Gold.25 Sometime after the tsunami in Asia, many singers, musicians, and actors/actresses, including Sonny and Wuv, participated in the recording of, &quot;Forever in Our Hearts&quot;, with all proceeds going to benefit the tsunami relief.26
P.O.D.'s sixth studio album Testify was slated for a December 2005 release, but was pushed back to January 24, 2006. On November 15, 2005, P.O.D. released The Warriors EP, Volume 2, which featured demos from the upcoming album, to help build up the fans' anticipation for the pending January release. The album's first single, &quot;Goodbye for Now&quot; (with a vocal tag by a then-unknown Katy Perry) went on to become a #1 video on MTV's TRL, along with having a solid radio presence, it also became the band's unprecedented 4th number one video on Total Request Live.27 The second single off the album, &quot;Lights Out&quot; was a minor hit, but was featured as the &quot;official theme song&quot; to WWE's Survivor Series on November 27, 2005. In another contribution to WWE, they performed fellow San Diego native Rey Mysterio's theme song &quot;Booyaka 619&quot; at WrestleMania 22.28 To promote their latest album, P.O.D. went on a nationwide tour called the &quot;Warriors Tour 2: Guilty by Association&quot;, which began in April, and included the bands Pillar, The Chariot and Maylene and the Sons of Disaster.29
On August 11, 2006, P.O.D. announced in their online newsletter that they had left Atlantic Records.3031 On September 16, 2006, P.O.D. announced that they have teamed up with Rhino Records to release a greatest hits record simply titled, Greatest Hits: The Atlantic Years, which was released on November 21, 2006. They shot a music video for their single &quot;Going In Blind&quot;, one of the two new songs they included in the tenth album, and they had meetings with various record labels to begin working on new material for an album they hoped to release in mid 2007.32
In a statement made by the band's manager on their MySpace page, it was officially announced, on December 30, 2006, that Jason Truby had left the band. They had said &quot;God worked it out because Jason decided to leave the band the same day Marcos asked to rejoin.&quot; Marcos performed with the band for the first time since his departure on the 2006 New Year's Eve episode of Jimmy Kimmel Live!.33 Marcos was scheduled to appear at this show before returning, which is why he was able to do it literally the day after he was announced as being back in the band.

Style and influences
The band's name, Payable on Death (P.O.D.), derives itself from the Christian doctrine that how an individual lives their life on Earth does not determine their eternal destination, but rather that Jesus Christ paid for the sins of people who put their faith in him (from which will come a transformation in their life evident of their stance as a new creation, righteous before God by the blood of Christ).43 P.O.D.'s style has evolved over the years, from the rap metal sound on their early albums to the nu metal and Reggae infused alternative metal styles for which they're most well known. Their latest album, When Angels &amp; Serpents Dance, is a combination of alternative rock, reggae rock and Latin influenced metal with almost none of the rap metal or nu metal sound of their older releases. P.O.D.'s influences include Santana, Bad Brains, Bob Marley, The Police, Metallica, Rage Against the Machine and Black Sabbath.
