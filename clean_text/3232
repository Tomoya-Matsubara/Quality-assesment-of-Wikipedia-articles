Monsignor James Peter Davis (June 9, 1904–March 4, 1988) was an American Archbishop of the Roman Catholic Church. Among his positions, were Archbishop of San Juan (1960–1964) and Archbishop of Santa Fe (1964–1974).
Davis was ordained a priest in May, 1929 in Michigan. In 1943, Pope Pius XII appointed Davis Bishop of San Juan, Puerto Rico. In 1960, Pope John XXIII raised the Diocese of San Juan into an Archdiocese, therefore raising Davis into an Archbishop and granting him the title of Monsignor.
During this time, Archbishop Davis entered a political controversy with the then Governor of Puerto Rico, Luis Mu&lt;U+00F1&gt;oz Mar&lt;U+00ED&gt;n. Davis was against Mu&lt;U+00F1&gt;oz's stands in abortion and other issues, and therefore, along with other bishops, he created a political party called Partido Accion Cristiana (Christian Action Party in English). Davis did not run for any political position but campaigned in favor of the candidates of his party. Mu&lt;U+00F1&gt;oz and his Popular Democratic Party were able to win the 1960 elections, however, he publicly criticized Archbishop Davis for having defied the separation of church and state.
In 1964, Pope Paul VI appointed the Puerto Rican Bishop Luis Aponte Martinez as Archbishop of San Juan. Davis was moved to the archdiocese of Santa Fe, New Mexico.
He resigned as Archbishop of Santa Fe in 1974 and retired until his death in 1988.
