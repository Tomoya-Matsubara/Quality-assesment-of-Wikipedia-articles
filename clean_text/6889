Nadia Ali () (born August 3, 1980 in Libya) is a Pakistani American singer-songwriter, the former front-woman and songwriter of the band iiO, whose 2001 hit Rapture reached #2 on the UK Singles chart.
Early years and iiO
Nadia Ali was born in Libya to Pakistani parents in 1980. The family relocated to Queens, New York City, when she was still a child, and has remained there.1
Ali has stated in interviews that the music that most influenced her growing up includes Stevie Nicks, Sade, Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, U2, Madonna, Led Zeppelin, Carole King, Carly Simon and The Beatles.2
A 17 year old Ali was working in the New York offices of Versace, and aspiring to start a music career, when a co-worker introduced her to producer Markus Moser, who was looking for a female singer to collaborate on some of his original dance music production.3 The two teamed up and started a group that was originally named &quot;Vaiio&quot;, named after the Sony laptop Nadia was working on. They later dropped the &quot;va&quot; to avoid causing problems in the future with Sony. Working with Moser, she wrote the lyrics and the vocals for the songs. After the success of the 2001 hit &quot;Rapture&quot;, the single was remixed many times by the likes of Armin Van Buuren, John Creamer &amp; Stephane K and Deep Dish with bootleg and white label remixes emerging as well. The duo toured all over the world for years and released more singles, including &quot;At the End&quot;, &quot;Runaway&quot;, &quot;Smooth&quot; and &quot;Kiss You&quot;.
Ali left the group in 2005 to pursue a solo career and released her debut album, Poetica, in 2006, while Moser continues to release iiO material featuring her on vocals. Most notably, these releases include the 2006 single &quot;Is It Love?&quot; which went to #1 in America on the Billboard Dance Chart, and the 2007 Album Reconstruction Time: The Best Of iiO Remixed.
