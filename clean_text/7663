Coronado is an affluent city in San Diego County, California, United States. The population was 24,100 at the 2000 census. Coronado is Spanish for &quot;the crowned one,&quot; and thus it is nicknamed The Crown City. It is also nicknamed The Tent City, referring to tents once situated south of the Hotel del Coronado that served as living quarters for hotel staff members. The city is a very popular tourist destination for San Diegans, other Americans, and International visitors alike. The small island resort-town prides itself on its small town atmosphere and uptown social environment. The district is one of the most expensive places to reside in California, San Diego County and the nation.
Coronado was featured in the 1960-1961 syndicated television series COronado 9, starring Rod Cameron as a private detective, Dan Adams, who operated from the San Diego area. COronado 9 refers to Adams' telephone exchange.
Geography
 Coronado is located at  (32.678190, -117.172581).
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 84.6 km&lt;U+00B2&gt; (32.7 mi&lt;U+00B2&gt;); 20 km&lt;U+00B2&gt; (7.7 mi&lt;U+00B2&gt;) of the city is land and 64.6 km&lt;U+00B2&gt; (24.9 mi&lt;U+00B2&gt;) of it (76.36%) is water.
Coronado is a peninsula connected to the mainland by a 10.0 mi narrow strip of land called the Silver Strand (or, locally, The Strand.) Locals often refer to Coronado as The Island or Coronado Island and they denote the core living and business area as The Village. Another nickname, mostly used by younger residents, is &quot;The Rock&quot;.
Originally Coronado was separated from North Island by a shallow channel called the Spanish Bight. The development of North Island by the United States Navy prior to World War II led to the filling of the Bight, combining the land areas into a single body. The Navy still operates Naval Air Station North Island (NASNI or &quot;North Island&quot;) on Coronado. On the opposite side of the island is the Coronado Amphibious Base, famous as a training center for Navy SEALs.
In 1969, the San Diego-Coronado Bridge was opened, allowing much faster transit between the cities than bay ferries or driving via State Route 75 along the Silver Strand. The city is currently weighing the options of additional construction on Highway 75 to alleviate congestion as traffic flows to and from San Diego and North Island.

Politics
Coronado has long been a Republican bastion, with about 51% of voters registered Republican, 25% Democrat and 21% nonpartisan, although the Republican lead is dropping.2 The political change is evident by the election of Casey Tanaka, a Democrat (and first minority representative in Coronado), as mayor in 2008. Many of its residents are retired Navy personnel. The district is also sheltered both politically and socially from the concerns of the wider San Diego metro, making its residents more connected to local issues and events.
In the state legislature Coronado is located in the 40th Senate District, represented by Democrat Denise Moreno Ducheny, and in the 79th Assembly District, represented by Democrat Mary Salas. Federally, Coronado is located in California's 53rd congressional district, which has a Cook PVI of D +123 and is represented by Democrat Susan Davis.

Tourism is an essential component of Coronado's economy.4 This city is home to three famous resorts (Hotel Del Coronado, Coronado Island Marriott and Loews Coronado Bay Resort as well as several other hotels and inns. 5
The downtown district along Orange Avenue with its many shops, restaurants and theaters is also a key part of the local economy. Many of the restaurants are highly rated and provide a wide variety of cuisine choices.6
Coronado is home to two major live theaters - the Lambs Players and Coronado Playhouse. They present a variety of great performances during the year. 7
There are several major businesses based in Coronado including Benetrends and Cybernetics Leadership Center. 8
And finally, one of the biggest employers in Coronado is the US Navy which operatings a number of facilities under the leadership of the Coronado Naval Base.
Local Festivals
One of the most popular annual events in this city is the Coronado Flower Show held usually on the 3rd weekend in April. Since 1925 thousands of visitors flock here to see the largest flower show held under tents in the West. Exhibits are placed inside tents surrounding a central gazebo, which becomes the stage for continuous entertainment, announcements and trophy presentations. 9
Coronado Island Sports Fiesta is sponsored by the local optimists club every year. Held in July this sports festival features a combination of competitative races, dives, rough-water swim and other events. 10
Hotel del Coronado
  Coronado is home to the famous Hotel del Coronado, built in 1888 and long considered one of the world's top resorts. It is listed as a National Historic Landmark and appeared in films such as Some Like It Hot and The Stunt Man, and was the setting of the Dashboard Confessional song Stolen. The historic hotel has had many American heroes come to visit, such as Charles Lindbergh, Thomas Edison and legendary sports figures such as Babe Ruth, Jack Dempsey, Willie Mays, Magic Johnson, and Muhammad Ali.  Many presidents have also visited, including Taft, Franklin Roosevelt, Johnson, Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan, George H.W. Bush, and Clinton and First Lady Laura Bush.
&quot;The Del&quot; was supposedly also the inspiration for Emerald City in The Wizard of Oz. Frank L. Baum would have been able to see the hotel from his front porch overlooking Star Park. Because of that, Coronado is often associated with the color green and is often referenced as &quot;The Emerald City&quot;. The colors of Coronado High were changed to green and white, the Coronado city flag is a tricolor of green-white-green with a crown in the middle, a local surf/skate shop is named Emerald City.
