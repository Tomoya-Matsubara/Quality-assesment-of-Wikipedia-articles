Kent is a city in the U.S. state of Ohio and the largest city in Portage County. It is located along the Cuyahoga River in Northeastern Ohio on the western edge of the county. The population was 27,906 at the 2000 United States Census and 27,983 in the 2008 estimate. The city is counted as part of the Akron Metropolitan Statistical Area and the larger Cleveland-Akron-Elyria Combined Statistical Area.
Part of the Connecticut Western Reserve, Kent was originally settled in 1805 and was known as Franklin Mills. Settlers were initially attracted to the area due to its location along the Cuyahoga River as a place for water-powered mills. Later development came in the 1830s and 1840s as a result of the village's position along the route of the Pennsylvania and Ohio Canal. Leading up to the American Civil War, Franklin Mills was noted for its activity in the Underground Railroad. With the decline of the canal and the emergence of the railroad, the village became the home of the Atlantic and Great Western Railroad maintenance shops through the influence of Marvin Kent. In 1864 the village was renamed Kent in honor of and in gratitude for Marvin Kent's efforts. Today Kent is a college town best known as the home of the main campus of Kent State University, founded in 1910, and as the site of the 1970 Kent State shootings.
Historically a manufacturing center, education is the city's largest economic sector with Kent State University the city's, and one of the region's, largest employers. The Kent City School District and the Kent Free Library provide additional education opportunities and resources. Many of Kent's demographic elements are influenced by the presence of the university, particularly the median age, median income, and those living below the poverty level. The city is governed by a council-manager system with a city manager, a nine-member city council, and a mayor. Kent has nearly 20 parks and preserves and hosts a number of annual festivals including ones related to Earth Day, folk music, and the U.S. Independence Day. In addition to the Kent State athletic teams, the city also hosts a number of amateur and local sporting events at various times during the year. Kent is part of the Cleveland-Akron media market and is the city of license for three local radio stations and three television stations and includes the regional affiliates for National Public Radio (NPR) and the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS). Although most residents commute to work in private vehicles, alternate transportation includes a public bus service and hike-and-bike trails. As the home of the Davey Tree Expert Company, Kent is known as &quot;The Tree City&quot; while residents are referred to as &quot;Kentites&quot;. The city has produced a number of notable individuals, particularly in politics, athletics, and the entertainment industry.
History

The region was originally inhabited by various tribes of American Indians, including the early Mound Builders. Around 1780, Captain Samuel Brady achieved notoriety for his activities in the area, including his famous leap of  over the Cuyahoga River to avoid capture by an unknown band of American Indians. The site, known as Brady's Leap, is now a city park.1 Settlement by Europeans began in the late 1790s and early 1800s. As part of the Connecticut Western Reserve, the area was divided into survey townships in 1798 and almost all of what is now Kent was originally part of Town 3 Range 9, which would eventually be known as Franklin Township.2 Aaron Olmsted, a wealthy Connecticut merchant, had purchased the  township and named it for his son Aaron Franklin Olmsted.3
Franklin Township was surveyed in 1803 and settled in November 1805 when John Haymaker and his family moved west from Warren to the banks of the Cuyahoga River. They were joined by John's brother George and their father Jacob Haymaker and their families early the next year, and built a gristmill in 1807.4 Initial growth in the area was slow, but eventually two small villages would develop due to the potential for power generated by the Cuyahoga River that could be used in gristmills and manufacturing. The first village, known as Franklin Mills, or locally as the &quot;Lower Village&quot;, developed mostly around the original Haymaker property. In 1818, Joshua Woodard arrived in the area and began constructing buildings just north of the village forming the &quot;Upper Village&quot; that would come to be known briefly as Carthage.5
 In the 1820s, Franklin Mills was included in the route of the Pennsylvania and Ohio Canal (P &amp; O Canal). When construction began on the canal in the mid-1830s, land speculation was rampant in many areas of northeast Ohio along the canal, including Franklin Mills. As a result, an industrial and business region was established along the east side of the river in what is now downtown Kent. Factories and mills were either planned or constructed along the Cuyahoga River, some of which either were never built or ultimately failed, due mostly to effects of the Panic of 1837. A lock and attached arch dam, however, was completed in 1836.6 The canal officially opened in 1840, but would only operate into the 1860s. By the 1870s the canal was completely shut down.7
In the era leading up to the American Civil War, Franklin Mills was an active stop on the Underground Railroad, giving fugitive slaves shelter on their escape to Canada. There were three notable stops in Franklin Mills, one of which still stands as of 2010.8 During this period, from 1835&lt;U+2013&gt;1839, noted American abolitionist John Brown moved to the village, operating a tannery along the Cuyahoga River with Zenas Kent.9
In 1863 the Atlantic and Great Western Railroad was constructed through Franklin Mills, due largely to the efforts of local businessman Marvin Kent, son of Zenas Kent. Marvin Kent had started his own railroad company, the Franklin and Warren Railroad, in 1851 after Franklin Mills, already home to several Kent family ventures and properties, was bypassed by the Cleveland and Pittsburgh Railroad that same year. Kent was also successful in getting the village named as the location of the railroad's maintenance yards and shops in 1864. The geographic location along the railroad and being home to the shops reinvented and revitalized the village as an important stop on the east-west line between St. Louis and New York City. The shops would open in 1865 and the railroad would play an important part of Kent's industry and development through the early 20th century before the shops were completely shut down in 1930. To honor Marvin Kent, the village was renamed Kent in 1864, although this change was not official until the village was incorporated on May 6, 1867.10
John Davey came to Kent in 1881 as head grounds keeper at Standing Rock Cemetery, and planted several trees, landscaped the cemetery, and performed experiments on trees. In 1901, he published his theories on tree surgery with his book The Tree Doctor, and later established the Davey Tree Expert Company in 1909. The efforts of Davey and the presence of Davey Tree led to the establishment of &quot;The Tree City&quot; as a nickname for Kent, which is reflected in the city's seal.1112 The company continues to be headquarted in Kent and serves as the city's largest private employer.13
After a fire destroyed the Seneca Chain Company in 1909, one of the city's main industries at the time, city leaders created the Kent Board of Trade in 1910, a forerunner to the Chamber of Commerce. The new Board was successful later that year in having Kent selected out of twenty northeastern Ohio cities as the site of a new teacher training college, which became known as the &quot;Kent State Normal School&quot;.14 The site for the school was on  of land donated by William S. Kent, son of Marvin Kent, on what was then the eastern edge of town. By 1929 the school was renamed Kent State College after the establishment of a college of liberal arts and degrees in the arts and sciences and in 1935 was renamed Kent State University after it was given authorization to grant advanced graduate degrees. The bill giving Kent State university status was signed into law by Ohio governor and Kent native Martin L. Davey, son of tree surgeon John Davey.15 During the 1950s and 1960s the growth of Kent State University combined with the effects of suburbanization resulted in significant population growth for the city, rising from just over 12,000 residents at the 1950 census to over 28,000 by 1970.16 Black squirrels were brought to the campus from Canada in 1961 by Kent State University head groundskeeper Larry Woodell. The squirrels have become an icon for both KSU and the city and are often used as unofficial mascots and symbols.1718
In early May 1970, protests began on the campus of Kent State University over the United States' invasion of Cambodia in the Vietnam War. These protests and demonstrations, which included rioting in downtown Kent on May 2, culminated in the May 4, 1970 Kent State shootings, where four students were killed and nine were wounded by the Ohio Army National Guard.19 Several memorials have been placed at the site over the years and commemorations have been held annually since 1971. In 2010 the entire site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.20 Also during the late 1960s and into the 1970s, construction of Haymaker Parkway, completed in 1975, brought changes to the city's layout while eliminating ongoing problems with traffic congestion and blocked rail crossings.21
In 2003, the 1836 arch dam was bypassed to meet water quality standards set by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency. To preserve the historic dam, a small park was built behind the dam and the river was rerouted through the old canal lock. During warm-weather months, water is pumped over the dam. The park, known as Heritage Park, was formally dedicated in May 2005.22
Geography
Kent is located in west-central Portage County in Northeast Ohio approximately  northeast of Akron and  southeast of Cleveland.23 It is bordered by Franklin Township on the north and east, Brimfield Township on the south, and Stow on the west. Other nearby communities include Brady Lake and Ravenna to the east and Sugar Bush Knolls and Streetsboro to the north. It is included in the Akron Metropolitan Statistical Area and the larger Cleveland-Akron-Elyria Combined Statistical Area.
Located on the western end of the Glaciated Allegheny Plateau, the topography of Kent includes rolling hills and varied terrain. The Cuyahoga River passes through the city, cutting a gorge with a drop of nearly  adjacent to the downtown area.24 The United States Geological Survey lists the city's elevation at  above sea level at a point near Kent's geographic center.25 Elevations vary slightly within the city limits with several buildings on the Kent State University campus at altitudes in excess of  and points as high as .2627 According to the United States Census Bureau, as of 2000 the city has a total area of , of which  is land and  (0.23%) is water.
Climate
 Kent's climate is classified as a humid continental climate in the Dfa K&lt;U+00F6&gt;ppen climate classification meaning it typically has very warm, humid summers and cold, snowy winters with moderate and variable spring and autumn seasons. The record high temperature is , set on July 7, 1988, with the record low of  recorded January 17, 1982.2829 During the spring and summer months, thunderstorms are fairly common and the area is susceptible to tornadoes, though the last recorded tornado in Kent occurred in 1973.3031 Effects from tropical systems can also be felt, usually taking the form of increased humidity, rain, and wind, such as with the remnants of Hurricane Ike in September 2008.32 During the winter months, snowfall is common and can occur in large quantities with considerable cloud cover. Kent is not considered part of the Lake Erie snowbelt, though lake-effect snow does occur at times. The city is in what is referred to as the &quot;secondary snowbelt&quot;, meaning it will receive heavier snowfall totals from lake-effect snow when certain wind directions are more prevalent, but typically sees far less snowfall than areas to the north closer to Lake Erie.33 While temperatures below the freezing point are typical in the winter months, thaw periods where temperatures exceed  and even  are not uncommon in January and February.34

Demographics

As a college town, Kent's demographic and population statistics are greatly affected by the presence and growth of Kent State University.35 As a result, several statistics are noticeably higher or lower than state and national averages including median age and the percentage of residents in the 18&lt;U+2013&gt;24 age bracket, families and individuals below the poverty line, and percentage of residents with a college degree.
Initial population growth in Kent was influenced by the location on the Cuyahoga River which led to the development of industrial and manufacturing jobs.36 Early settlers mainly came from the northeastern United States and were largely of German descent.37 After the arrival of the Atlantic and Great Western Railroad in 1863, growth was steady into the early 20th century with the village battling Ravenna for the position of Portage County's largest city.3839 By the 1930 Census, Kent had passed Ravenna as the county's most populous city with even larger population growth in the 1950s and 1960s rising from 12,148 in 1950 to 28,183 by 1970.40 As of 2008, Kent remains the county's largest city.41 Most recent population measurements of the city have shown the effect of changes in the city's overall population coinciding with changes in the number of students living on campus as well as a reduction in the number of persons per housing unit.42 The 2008 estimate placed the population at 27,983.43
As of the 2000 Census, there were 27,906 people, 9,772 households, and 4,798 families residing in the city. The population density was 3,212.3 people per square mile (1,239.9/km&lt;U+00B2&gt;). There were 10,435 housing units at an average density of 1,201.2/sq mi (463.6/km&lt;U+00B2&gt;). The racial makeup of the city was 86.07% White, 9.11% African American, 2.15% Asian, 0.19% Native American, 0.03% Pacific Islander, 0.44% from other races, and 2.01% from two or more races. 1.28% of the population is Hispanic or Latino of any race.44 Though slightly below the national averages for diversity, Kent is very close to the averages for Ohio and above the averages for the surrounding area.45
There were 9,772 households out of which 25.8% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 32.8% were married couples living together, 13.3% had a female householder with no husband present, and 50.9% were non-families. 32.4% of all households were made up of individuals and 8.1% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.27 and the average family size was 2.89.46
In the city the population was spread out with 16.4% under the age of 18, 40.0% from 18 to 24, 23.0% from 25 to 44, 13.1% from 45 to 64, and 7.5% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 23 years, which was well below both the median age for Ohio (36.2) and the United States (35.3).47 For every 100 females there were 84.6 males, well below the state average of 96.3 males and the national average of 94.4 males per 100 females. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 81.0 males, again below both the state (91.1) and national (93.4) averages. This is in marked contrast to neighboring Franklin Township, which had 104.3 males for every 100 females and 101.4 males for every 100 females in 2000.48
The median income for a household in the city was $29,582, and the median income for a family was $44,440.49 This compared with Ohio's median household income of $40,956 and $41,994 for the United States.50 Males had a median income of $32,063 versus $25,344 for females. The per capita income for the city was $15,015. About 15.4% of families and 25.2% of the population were below the poverty line, including 24.2% of those under age 18 and 9.5% of those age 65 or over.51 This is higher than both the state and national averages, with 10.6% of individuals in Ohio and 12.4% in the United States being below the poverty line and 7.8% of families in Ohio and 9.2% in the United States.52
Educationally, Kent is above the national, state, and local averages for residents who have attained a bachelor's, master's, or above a master's degree. At the 2000 Census, 37.1% of Kent's population above the age of 25 had obtained a college degree compared to 21.0% of the same population in Portage County, 21.2% statewide, and 24.4% nationally.53
Economy
 Kent's location along the Cuyahoga River and later the Pennsylvania and Ohio Canal and multiple railroad lines made it attractive initially for the establishment of small gristmills for the production of flour and various factories. Progressively larger factories later developed due to increased power available from the river and eventually due to the ease and lower cost of transportation of goods to other markets.54 During the latter half of the 19th century and into the early 20th century, the city's largest employers were all industrially based, including the Atlantic and Great Western Railroad and its successors, which operated its main maintenance shops in the village; the Seneca Chain Company; and bus manufacturer Twin Coach among others.55 A disastrous fire at the Seneca Chain Company in 1909 led to the creation of the Kent Board of Trade&lt;U+2014&gt;an early Chamber of Commerce&lt;U+2014&gt;which was successful in getting Kent selected in 1910 as the site of what would become Kent State University.56
Changes in the structure of the railroad and declines in the manufacturing sector during the mid-20th century combined with the rapid growth of Kent State University following World War II led to the university becoming the city's largest employer and influenced the development of other areas of the city's economy. Beginning in the late 2000s, the university, along with the city and private investors, began to play a more active role in the redevelopment of downtown Kent and has aided in the development of local high tech companies.5758 Kent State operates Centennial Research Park, along Ohio State Route 59 in Kent's Joint Economic Development District with Franklin Township, which houses two high tech start-up companies in the liquid crystal industry.5960 Kent has an additional Joint Economic Development District with Brimfield Township south of the city limits.61 Through the Kent Regional Business Alliance, the city also supports two business incubators.62
 As of 2008, the educational, health, and social services fields were the city's largest sector, and employed over 29% of Kent's workforce. This included the city's two largest employers, Kent State University and the Kent City School District, as well as Robinson Memorial Hospital, which operates an outpatient surgery center and general medical facility.636465 22% of the workforce is employed in arts, entertainment, and food service, with 15% employed in retail. Manufacturing accounts for 8.2% of the workforce with a Land O' Lakes plant being the largest employer in the sector.6667 Kent is also home to the corporate headquarters of the Davey Tree Expert Company, which serves as the city's largest private employer.68 In 2010 Davey Tree announced plans to relocate staff from its Davey Resource Group to Kent as part of a planned downtown development and has stated long-term goals include having all corporate offices in Kent.69
76% of those employed commuted alone to work by way of a car, truck, or van with another 7% carpooling. 10.6% of workers walked to work with 1.8% using public transportation. The average commute time was approximately 19 minutes. The U.S. Census Bureau estimated unemployment at 8.7% in 2008 while the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics estimated unemployment in Kent at 5.2% in 2008 and 8.2% in February 2010.7071
Culture
 Cultural elements in Kent include various arts, environmental, and entertainment events during the year, as well as the Kent State University Museum. The Kent Heritage Festival is held every July in the downtown area, coinciding with the U.S. Independence Day. The festival includes crafts, booths, entertainment, train rides, 5K and 10K races, and fireworks, drawing approximately 25,000 people each year.72 In October, Kent hosts the homecoming festivities for Kent State University, including a parade down East Main Street as well as other events and activities both on campus and around the city.73 Also in October, the downtown area hosts an annual, yet unofficial, Halloween celebration, which usually takes place the last Saturday of October. The event typically draws thousands, largely Kent State students, and includes many who dress in costume.7475 In 2007 Main Street Kent, a local organization that promotes downtown Kent, created a family-oriented Halloween event downtown that precedes the unofficial celebration.76 Since 2007, Kent has hosted an annual environmental festival known as &quot;Who's Your Mama?&quot; which takes place in conjunction with Earth Day. The festival includes events at various locations in the city, such as a vegan chef competition, concerts, a film festival, guest speakers, and booths on environment-based topics.77 Through Main Street Kent, additional events downtown include the annual Haymaker Farmers' Market, held every Saturday morning from May through October, as well as an ice cream social event in August, an outdoor concert series and &quot;sidewalk cinema&quot; between May and September, an art and wine festival in June, a cider festival in November, and the Festival of Lights Christmas celebration in early December.78
The Kent Stage, located downtown, is a performance venue for a variety of arts performances in music and theater. It hosts around 90 concerts, four theatrical performances, and four film festivals or movie premiers per year, including local, national, and international performers. Since opening in 2002, it has been visited by approximately 120,000 patrons from all over Ohio, 38 U.S. states, and 3 countries.79 In April, it hosts events related to the &quot;Who's Your Mama?&quot; Earth Day festival and in November, it is one of the host venues for the Kent State Folk Festival, an annual event in folk music since the late 1960s. Performances are held in several venues in Kent and on the campus of Kent State University.80 The Kent Stage also hosts the Kent Blues Festival and a local artist music festival known as the Up From The River Music Festival.81
 Kent is also home to the Kent State University Museum, located in Rockwell Hall on the KSU campus. The museum focuses on the history of fashion design and decorative arts in the United States and around the world from the 18th century to the present.82 Each year in early May, the university hosts an annual commemoration of the Kent State shootings, which typically includes several speakers, forums, artwork, and other related events.83 Kent State began to develop a visitors' center in 2010 to cover the events surrounding the shootings. It will be housed in Taylor Hall on the site recently added to the National Register of Historic Places and plans include three galleries covering art and media from the era of the 1960s leading up to the shootings, images from the actual event, and the local and national impact after the shootings.84
In addition to the Kent State Shootings Site near the center of campus, there are also a number of additional sites and districts in Kent on the National Register of Historic Places, some of which are open to the public. The Kent Industrial District is a historical district along the Cuyahoga River adjacent to downtown that includes an area and structures that were important in Kent's early history.85 On the northwestern part of the Kent State University campus is the Ohio State Normal College At Kent district, which includes the school's five original classic revival buildings dating to 1913.86 There is also the West Main Street District just west of downtown that includes 20 private homes of architectural and historical significance from the post-Civil War and early 20th century periods. The district includes the Kent Masonic Center, which was originally built in the early 1880s as the home of Marvin Kent and his family, and the former residence of Martin L. Davey, who served as Governor of Ohio.8788 Buildings in Kent listed on the register include three private homes noted for their architecture styles: the John Davey House for the Second Empire style, and both the Aaron Ferrey and Charles Kent Houses as examples of Gothic Revival.899091 Other buildings include the 1869 Kent Jail, now used by the Parks and Recreation Department, and the 1837 Franklin Township Hall, the site of eventual U.S. President James A Garfield's first nomination for public office in 1859.9293
Sports

 As the home of Kent State University, Kent is also the home of the University's athletic teams, the Golden Flashes, who compete in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) at the Division I level as a member of the Mid-American Conference East Division. Several of Kent State's teams have enjoyed league and national success, the most notable being the men's basketball team's run to the Elite Eight in the 2002 NCAA Basketball Tournament.9495 The 6,327-seat Memorial Athletic and Convocation Center, commonly referred to as the MAC Center, is the site of a number of athletic events in multiple sports, including periodically hosting the Mid-American Conference's wrestling and women's gymnastics championships.9697
In addition to hosting the KSU football team, Kent State's 25,000-seat Dix Stadium has been a venue for high school football games both in the regular-season and the state playoffs.9899 The adjacent Murphy-Mellis Field is a location for Ohio High School Athletic Association (OHSAA) field hockey tournament games and the Diamond at Dix is a site for OHSAA regional softball tournament games.100101 From 1975 to 1981 the Cleveland Browns held their training camp in Kent at Kent State University.102
The Kent State University Ice Arena serves as host to several local ice hockey programs including youth leagues, high school and professional teams, and as a site for OHSAA high school tournament games and ice skating competitions in addition to being home of KSU's club team, which competes in the American Collegiate Hockey Association.103104 The ice arena is also the home of the Kent Twisters, a member of the Pennsylvania-Ohio Women's Hockey Association, an adult amateur women's ice hockey league.105 Kent also plays host to the Portage County Open tennis tournament, held annually at the tennis courts of Theodore Roosevelt High School.106
Parks and recreation
 The city operates nearly 20 parks and preserves, the largest of which is the  Fred Fuller park along the Cuyahoga River, named after a former Kent Parks chairmain. The park includes the Kramer Fields baseball and softball complex, which contains four fields, two of which are lighted. Several of the parks along the Cuyahoga River are on or near areas of historical significance. Franklin Mills Riveredge Park, which follows the Cuyahoga River through downtown Kent, passes through a large portion of the Kent Industrial District along with Heritage Park and includes sites related to the Pennsylvania and Ohio Canal.107108 Adjacent on the south is the John Brown Tannery Park, on the site of the former tannery John Brown operated with Zenas Kent in the 1830s, while Brady's Leap park, adjacent to the north, is at the location of the famed leap over the Cuyahoga River by Captain Samuel Brady circa 1780.109110 The parks and recreation department, in addition to operating and maintaining the city's parks and preserves, also operates a recreation center on the city's south side and offers several sports, arts, and education programs at various locations in Kent.111112 The department also sponsors events throughout the year including Art in the Park, an ice-skating party, hayrides, and Santa's Arrival.113 The Kent City School District operates an indoor pool at Theodore Roosevelt High School that is available for public recreational and instructional use outside of its use by the school for athletics and physical education. The pool hosts swimming lessons and serves as a home venue for the Hudson-based Hudson Explorers Aquatic Team, a competitive swimming program for ages five and above.114115
As of 2010, the Portage Hike and Bike Trail was under construction or in planning, with several phases already completed in Kent. The trail, when fully complete, will connect with the hike and bike trails in neighboring Summit County and will link Kent with nearby communities in Portage County.116 The city is also home to the Tom S. Cooperrider-Kent Bog State Nature Preserve, located in the southern edge of Kent. It is one of the most intact bogs in Ohio, with the southernmost and largest stand of tamarack trees in the continental United States.117
Government
 Kent is governed by a charter form of government with a council-manager system of nine council members and a mayor. The city is divided into six wards and voters select a mayor, a council member representing their ward, and three at-large council members in staggered four-year terms.118 The city charter, adopted in 1963, is reviewed by a charter commission every 10 years who then make recommendations for changes, the last review being in 2005.119120 The city council hires a city manager who oversees the day-to-day operations in the various city departments and enforces policies set by council. The mayor serves a largely ceremonial role as president of the council and votes only in the event of a tie. Kent voters approved the change from a mayor-council system to council-manager in 1975 and it went into effect in 1977.121 Jerry Fiala began his term as mayor January 1, 2010 and Dave Ruller began serving as city manager June 15, 2005.122123
As part of the city government, Kent also has departments of community development, health, human services, law, parks and recreation, public safety, and public service.124 The Public Service Department oversees a variety of construction and maintenance works as well as the city's water treatment and water reclamation systems while the Public Safety Department includes both the police and fire departments.125 The Kent Police Department is housed in the city's Safety Administration Building and includes 911 dispatch for Kent and Franklin Township.126 Kent State University also operates its own police department, which mainly patrols the KSU campus and KSU property in and out of the Kent city limits.127 The two departments frequently communicate and are headed by twin brothers: James Peach in the city and John Peach at the university.128 The fire department operates two stations, the main station adjacent to the Safety Administration Building and the West Side Fire Station along North Mantua Street on the western side of the Cuyahoga River. Kent Fire also provides fire and emergency medical service coverage for Franklin Township and the village of Sugar Bush Knolls.129
The city's main sources of tax revenue come from income tax, set at 2.0%, and property tax.130 In 2009, the city operated on a budget of approximately $40 million. The largest percentage of the budget, 22.8% or $2.6 million, was spent on the Fire and Emergency medical services and the city's Income Tax Safety Fund, respectively. Expenditures on Capital Projects accounted for 22.4% or $2.5 million of the budget, 17.5% or $2 million towards the city's General Fund, and $550,000 allocated for street repair and maintenance.131
At the state level, Kent is part of the 68th district of the Ohio House of Representatives, represented by Democrat Kathleen Chandler, a Kent resident and former mayor.132133 In the State Senate, Kent is part of the 28th district, represented since 2007 by Democrat Tom Sawyer of Akron.134135 At the Federal level, Kent is part of Ohio's 17th congressional district, represented since 2003 by Democrat Tim Ryan of Niles.136137
Education

 Preschool, elementary, and secondary education is mainly provided by the Kent City School District with the small portion of the city south of State Route 261 a part of the neighboring Field Local School District.138 The Kent district was created around 1860 and later merged with the Franklin Township and Brady Lake school districts in 1959.139140 It serves most of Kent and Franklin Township, the villages of Brady Lake and Sugar Bush Knolls and a small part of southern Streetsboro.141 Kent has five neighborhood elementary schools that serve students in grades K&lt;U+2013&gt;5, Stanton Middle School for grades 6&lt;U+2013&gt;8, and Theodore Roosevelt High School for grades 9&lt;U+2013&gt;12. The district also operates a preschool program housed at Davey Elementary School, and is a member of the Six District Educational Compact with five surrounding districts to facilitate vocational education with many of these programs housed at Theodore Roosevelt High School.142143 In 1985, Theodore Roosevelt High School was given the United States Department of Education Excellence in Education award and the school has been rated &quot;Excellent&quot; by the Ohio Department of Education since 2004.144145 In December 2009, it was named in US News &amp; World Report as one of the best high schools in the United States, earning the publication's Bronze Medal designation.146 The Kent City School District has been consistently rated as &quot;Excellent&quot; or &quot;Effective&quot; by the Ohio Department of Education and in 2007 Walls Elementary School was named a &quot;School of Promise&quot; by the Ohio Department of Education, while Longcoy Elementary earned the U.S. Department of Education's prestigious Blue Ribbon School award.147148 Kent also has one private school, St. Patrick School, which serves around 300 students in grades K&lt;U+2013&gt;8 from Kent and several surrounding communities. It is part of Kent's St. Patrick parish and is affiliated with the Roman Catholic Diocese of Youngstown.149150
 The Kent Free Library is the main public library. It was established in 1892 after Kent became the first village in Ohio to use an 1892 state law which allowed municipalities under a population of 5,000 to tax residents for the upkeep of a library. Andrew Carnegie donated $10,000 in 1901 for construction of a permanent home for the library, which opened in 1903.151 The 2006 expansion to the library brought available space to  with a book collection of 147,390 items as of 2010.152153 It is a school district library associated with the Kent City School District and is also part of the Portage Library Consortium, connecting it with Reed Memorial Library in Ravenna and the Portage County District Library, which maintains six branch libraries across the county and a bookmobile.154155
The main campus of Kent State University is located in the southeastern part of the city. The campus itself occupies approximately  and the university owns thousands of additional acres adjacent to the campus.

Later, the Methodists built another building in 1828 that was also used by multiple denominations.204 The oldest church building in Kent still used as a place of worship is the Unitarian Universalist Church on Gougler Avenue, which was dedicated in 1868. The former home of the Congregational Church was dedicated in 1858 and still stands along Gougler Avenue very near the Unitarian Universalist Church. It served as the home of the First Congregational Church&lt;U+2014&gt;which became the Kent United Church of Christ in 1964&lt;U+2014&gt;until 1955.205 It was later purchased by a local business and used as their corporate headquarters.206

Notable residents and natives


 Kent has produced and been home to a number of notable individuals in varying fields. Its natives and residents are referred to as &quot;Kentites&quot;.211 John Davey, a pioneer in tree surgery and founder of the Davey Tree Expert Company moved to Kent in the 1880s. His son, Martin L. Davey, would later serve as Governor of Ohio and a U.S. Representative. Other political figures to come from Kent include Wisconsin governor Lucius Fairchild, former U.S. Representative Robert E. Cook, and noted abolitionist John Brown, who lived in what was then Franklin Mills from 1835&lt;U+2013&gt;1839.212213 Noted athletes to have come from Kent include former National Football League players Mike Adamle, Tom DeLeone, and Stan White and former Major League Baseball player, manager, and executive Gene Michael.214215 Two members of the band Devo, which debuted in Kent in 1973 and was founded by Kent State University students, are natives of Kent: Peter Gregg and Rod Reisman.216 Other performing artists to come from Kent include singer Julianne Baird, playwright Vincent J.

Sister cities
Kent has one sister city, Dudince, a small spa town of about 1,500 people in southern Slovakia.225 The relationship was established in 2003 through Sister Cities International and resulted in the formation of the Kent-Dudince Sister City Association to promote learning and understanding of the Slovakian culture.226 The group meets regularly and organizes cultural exchanges and programs that feature Slovakian dance and music.227 Cultural exchanges have included a performance of a choir from Kent's Theodore Roosevelt High School in Dudince in 2004 and tour groups from Kent visiting in 2006 and 2008.228229230
