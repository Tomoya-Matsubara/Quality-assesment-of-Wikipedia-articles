In the U.S. state of Colorado, Interstate 70 is an Interstate Highway traversing an east-west route across the center of the state. The highway connects the metropolitan areas of Denver and Grand Junction via a route through the Rocky Mountains. The Colorado portion of I-70 is noted for the Eisenhower Tunnel which is the highest vehicular tunnel in the world and the highest point along the Interstate Highway System.1 The Glenwood Canyon portion of the freeway is also noted as an engineering marvel.2 It is one of the last pieces of the Interstate Highway system to be completed, in 1992.3 As of the date of its completion, this section had the most expensive construction cost per mile.4
I-70's construction is equally noted as an engineering marvel and unintentionally became a major event in the Women's Liberation Movement5. The Colorado portion of I-70 was built parallel to U.S. Route 40 east of Idaho Springs, Colorado. West of Idaho Springs I-70 was built along the corridor of a road that was numbered U.S. Route 6 at the time of I-70's construction.

I-70 inside Glenwood Canyon paralleling the Colorado River and Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad main line, now operated by the Union Pacific Railroad 

Grand Valley
I-70 enters Colorado from Utah following at first Rabbit Valley and then Grand Valley. Both valleys are just south of the Book Cliffs and formed by the Colorado River or its tributaries. The freeway then serves Grand Junction the largest city along the Western Slope and the economic capital of western Colorado and eastern Utah. The freeway passes to the north of downtown.
Western Slope
The highway exits the Grand Valley and continues to use the Colorado River as its path up the Western Slope of the Rocky Mountains. The first canyon of the Colorado is De Beque Canyon. This is also where the first pair of several tunnels is used to aid I-70 over the Rockies.6
The highway then enters Glenwood Canyon, considered one of the most scenic features of the Interstate Highway System and one of the most expensive roads per mile to build in the Interstate System. The freeway usually hugs the north bank of the Colorado River with the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad occupying the south bank. In the canyon the freeway passes through 2.5 pairs of tunnels, two tunnels driving east and three tunnels driving west.7 The largest tunnel is called the Hanging Lake tunnel.
Rocky Mountains
 The highway departs the the Colorado River near the railroad junction of Dotsero and follows the Eagle River for its path towards Vail and Vail Pass at an elevation of .8 The highway then proceeds down to Dillon Reservoir and one final push up straight creek to the Continental Divide through Eisenhower Tunnel, the highest automotive tunnel in the world. At  this is the highest point along the Interstate Highway System and the longest tunnel built under the Interstate Highway program.9 The tunnel was originally called the straight creek after the creek used for the western approach.10
The freeway uses Clear Creek for its path down the eastern side of the Rockies. Along the way, the highway passes through one more set of tunnels near Idaho Springs. The last portion of the Rocky Mountains traversed as the highway enters Denver is frequently called the Hogback.
Front Range
 I-70 then enters the Denver metropolitan area, also frequently called the Front Range. The Front Range is also refers to the last portion of the Rocky Mountains, and the beginning of the Great Plains. The freeway is routed to the north of the LoDo district, the common name of the downtown area of Denver. Here it meets Interstate 25 in an intersection frequently called the Mousetrap. The highway then passes by the former site of Stapleton International Airport and then proceeds east out of Denver
Great Plains
East of Aurora I-70 joins the alignment of Colfax Avenue. This street serves as the main street of Denver, and is still the alignment of U.S. Route 40 through downtown Denver. From this point east the freeway, now joined with US 40 proceeds due east across the Great Plains. The freeway dips south to serve the city of Limon then continues due east. The highway enters Kansas due east of Burlington.
History

I-70 crossing the Rocky Mountains 

Earlier routes
The path of I-70 in Colorado is derived from two previous highways, U.S. Route 6 and U.S. Route 40. US 40 was an original piece of the U.S. Highway system commissioned in 1926. The portion now numbered U.S. Route 6 came about in 1937 when the route over Vail Pass was paved. A portion of this route was also numbered U.S. Route 24 at the time.11.
Interstate Highway planning
As first proposed the western terminus of I-70 was Denver, using the corridor of U.S. Route 40 as the base for the new freeway.12 Colorado governor Edwin C. Johnson was a primary force in persuading the planners of the Interstate Highway System to extend the highway to traverse the entire state. He stated to the senate subcommittee:

You are going to have a four-lane highway through Wyoming. You are going to build two four-lane highways through New Mexico and Arizona. Colorado needs to be able to compete with our neighboring States. We do not want to take anything away from them. We do not want them to get way out ahead of us, either, because these interstate highways are going to be very attractive highways for the East and West to travel on.13

He was able to convince officials in Utah that they would benefit by having a direct freeway link between Denver and Salt Lake City. In honor of his efforts the westbound bore of the Eisenhower Tunnel is named after him.
There was some debate on which corridor would be used to extend the freeway to Utah.14 The three proposals were to use the routes of U.S. Route 40, which crests the Continental Divide via Berthoud Pass, or U.S. Route 6 which crests at Loveland Pass, or U.S. Route 24 at Tennessee Pass15. It was soon decided that the US 6 corridor was the most practical of the alternatives, but regardless it was impractical to built a road across the Continental Divide in Colorado that conformed to Interstate Highway standards.
Eisenhower Tunnel
 The decision was made to tunnel underneath the continental divide. Several alternatives were considered before deciding on using Straight Creek as the corridor for this tunnel. It was originally called the Straight Creek Tunnel but renamed the Eisenhower-Johnson Memorial Tunnel, after President Dwight D. Eisenhower and Governor Edwin C. Johnson.
Construction on the first bore of the tunnel was started on March 15, 1968.16 Construction efforts suffered many setbacks and the project went well over time and budget. The frustration prompted one engineer to comment in frustration, &quot;We were going by the book, but the damned mountain couldn't read.&quot;17 One of the biggest setbacks was the discovery of fault lines in the path of the tunnel that were not discovered during the pilot bores18. Thought the project was supposed to take 3 years, the tunnel was not opened to traffic until March 8, 1973. Initially this tunnel (the Eisenhower bore) was used for 2 way traffic with one way in each direction. The amount of traffic through the tunnel exceeded predictions and efforts soon begin to expedite construction on the second bore (Johnson bore).Construction began on the second tunnel on August 18, 1975 and finished on December 21, 1979.19
The tunnel construction became unintentionally involved in the Women's Liberation Movement when Janet Bonneman applied for work with the Colorado Department of Transportation. She was given a position in the construction of the Straight Creek tunnels project. However, after 18 months on the job she had still not entered the tunnel, instead doing support work from the office. There was opposition to a woman entering the construction site with one supervisor stating if she entered, &quot;Those workers would flat walk out of that there tunnel and they'd never come back.&quot;20 Emboldened by the passage of a equal rights law in Colorado, she finally entered the tunnel on November 9, 1972. Several workers did walk off the job, but most returned the next day. She remained determined, and returned to work the next day, and even did work on the roof of the tunnel overlooking the men below.21
Glenwood Canyon
 With the tunnels open for traffic, the last remaining obstacle for I-70 to be an interstate commerce artery was the two lane portion in Glenwood Canyon. Construction had started on this portion in the 1960's but was stopped due to environmentalist protests that caused a 30 year controversy22. The final design attempted to minimize environmental impacts and involved 40 bridges and viaducts, three tunnels (not counting 2 that were built before construction was stopped in the 1960's) and  of retaining wall.2324. The freeway was finally complete in October 1992. Many people consider this to be the last piece of the Interstate Highway System to open, although gaps still exist in Interstate 95 and Breezewood, Pennsylvania.
