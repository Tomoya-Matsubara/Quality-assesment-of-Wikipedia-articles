The golden plates, also called the gold plates or the golden bible (an antiquated reference),1 were a set of engraved plates, bound into a book, that Joseph Smith, Jr. said was his source material for the Book of Mormon, a scripture of the Latter Day Saint movement. Smith, the founder of that movement, said he obtained the plates on September 22, 1827 on Cumorah hill in Manchester, New York, where they were hidden in a buried box and protected by an angel named Moroni. After dictating a translation and obtaining signed statements by eleven other witnesses, he said he returned the plates to the angel in 1829.
According to the Book of Mormon, the golden plates were engraved by a pre-Columbian prophet-warrior named Mormon and his son Moroni (who after death protected the buried plates as the angel Moroni) in about the year 400 CE. These men said they had abridged earlier historical records from other sets of metal plates in a language they called &quot;reformed Egyptian.&quot;2 Part of the plates were said to have been sealed, and thus could not be translated. The golden plates are the most significant of a number of metallic plates important to Latter Day Saint history and theology.
Background
As a youth, Joseph Smith, Jr. lived on his parents' farm near Palmyra, New York a place and time noted for its participation in the Second Great Awakening and a &quot;craze for treasure hunting.&quot;3 Beginning in the early 1820s, he was paid to act as a &quot;seer&quot;, to use seer stones in (mostly unsuccessful) attempts to locate lost items and buried treasure.4 Some contemporaries state that he would put the stone in a white stovepipe hat, put his face over the hat to block the light, and then &quot;see&quot; the information in the reflections of the stone.5 Some say that his favored stone, chocolate-colored and about the size of an egg,6 was found in a deep well he helped dig for one of his neighbors.7
Obtaining the plates
Smith said that he first learned about the golden plates on the eve of September 22 8 in 1823 (or possibly 1822), 9 when, in his bedroom late at night thinking about his First Vision, 10 an angel 11 named Moroni appeared to him three times. 12 Moroni told him that the plates could be found buried in a prominent hill near his home later referred to as Cumorah (a name from the Book of Mormon). 13
According to Smith and contemporaries who heard his account, the angel said he would not allow Smith to take the plates until he was able to obey certain &quot;commandments&quot;. 14 Smith and his believing followers said the angel's requirements included the following: that Smith tell his father about the vision, 15 that he have no thought of using the plates for monetary gain, 16 that he take the plates and go directly away without looking back, 17 that the plates never directly touch the ground until safe at home in a locked chest, 18 and that he never show the plates to any unauthorized person. 19 The last three of the angel's requirements were corroborated by non-believers who heard the story from Smith or his father, and who also add that Smith said the angel required him to wear &quot;black clothes&quot; to the site of the plates, 20 to ride a &quot;black horse with a switchtail&quot;, 21 to call for the plates by a certain name, 22 and to &quot;give thanks to God&quot;.23

An 1841 engraving of &quot;Mormon Hill&quot; (looking south), where Smith said he found the Golden Plates on the west side, near the peak.

In the morning, Smith began to work as usual and did not tell his father about the vision24 because he did not think his father would believe him.25 When he fainted because he had been awake all night, he said the angel appeared a fourth time and chastised him for failing to tell his father. 26 Smith's father believed the vision and encouraged his son to obey the angel's commandments. 27 Smith then set off to visit the hill. To locate the place where the plates were buried, both believing and non-believing witnesses say he used his seer stone 28 and, according to one hearer of the account, he used the seer stone to follow a sequence of landmarks by horse and on foot until he arrived at the place the plates were buried. 29 Smith said he &quot;knew the place the instant that I arrived there&quot; because the angel had shown him the location during the previous night's visions. 30
At the proper location, he saw a large stone covering a stone (or possibly iron) box. 31 After using a stick to remove dirt from the edges of the stone cover and prying it up with a lever, 32 he said he saw the plates inside, together with other artifacts. 33 According to Smith's 1835 biography and other accounts, he &quot;supposed his success certain&quot; in obtaining the plates. 34 According to Smith's trusted followers, Smith said he picked up the plates, but then put them on the ground while he covered the box with the stone to protect other valuable treasures in the box from being taken later by passers-by. 35 Nevertheless, when Smith looked back at the plates on the ground after closing the box, the plates had once again disappeared into the box. 36 According to two non-believing Palmyra residents, when Smith once again raised the stone and attempted to retrieve the plates, Smith saw in the box something like a toad that grew larger and struck him to the ground. 37 Although Smith's contemporary followers do not mention a toad-like creature, they agree with several non-believers that Smith said he was stricken by a supernatural force that hurled him to the ground as many as three times. 38
Disconcerted by his inability to obtain the plates, Smith said he briefly wondered whether his experience had been a &quot;dreem of Vision&quot; [sic]. 39 Concluding that it was not, he prayed asking why he had been barred from taking the plates. 40 In response to his question, Smith said the angel appeared and told him he could not receive the plates because he &quot;had been tempted of the advisary (sic) and saught (sic) the Plates to obtain riches and kept not the commandments that I should have.&quot; 41 According to Smith's followers, Smith had also broken the angel's commandment &quot;not to lay the plates down, or put them for a moment out of his hands&quot;, 42 and according to a non-believer, Smith said &quot;I had forgotten to give thanks to God&quot; as required by the angel. 43
Smith said the angel instructed him to return the next year, on September 22 1824, with the &quot;right person&quot;, who the angel said was his older brother Alvin. 44 Alvin died in November 1823, so Smith returned to the hill in 1824 and asked what he should do, 45 but to his family's disappointment, he did not return with the plates. 46 Smith said he was told to return the next year with the &quot;right person,&quot; but the angel did not tell Smith who that person might be. 47 For the visit on September 22 1825, Smith may have attempted unsuccessfully to bring his treasure-hunting associate Samuel T. Lawrence, 48 but eventually, Smith determined after looking into his seer stone that the &quot;right person&quot; was Emma Hale, his future wife. 49
Smith said that he visited the hill &quot;at the end of each year&quot; for four years after the first visit in 1823, 50 but there is no specific record of him being in the Palmyra vicinity between January 1826 and January 1827 when he returned to Palmyra from Pennsylvania with his new wife. 51 After his arrival in Palmyra in January 1827, Smith visited the hill and returned to tell his parents that the angel had severely chastised him for not being &quot;engaged enough in the work of the Lord.&quot; 52 The next annual visit on September 22 1827 would be his last chance to receive the plates. 53
According to Brigham Young, as the scheduled date to obtain the plates approached, several Palmyra residents expressed concern &quot;that they were going to lose that treasure&quot; and sent for a skilled necromancer from 60 miles away, encouraging him to make three separate trips to Palmyra to find the plates. 54 During one of these trips, the unnamed necromancer is said to have discovered the location, but was unable to determine the value of the plates. 55 A few days prior to the September 22 1827 visit to the hill, Smith's loyal treasure-hunting friends Josiah Stowell and Joseph Knight, Sr. traveled to Palmyra, in part, to be there during Smith's scheduled visit to the hill. 56
Another of Smith's former treasure-hunting associates, Samuel T. Lawrence, was also apparently aware of the approaching date to obtain the plates, and Smith was concerned he might cause trouble. 57 Therefore, on the eve of September 22 1827, the scheduled date for retrieving the plates, Smith dispatched his father to spy on Lawrence's house until dark. If Lawrence attempted to leave, the elder Joseph would have informed him that his son would &quot;thrash the stumps with him&quot; if he found him at the hill, but Lawrence never left his home. 58 Late at night, Smith took a horse and carriage to the hill Cumorah with his wife Emma. 59 While Emma stayed in the wagon kneeling in prayer,60 Joseph walked to what he said was the site of the Golden Plates. Some time in the early morning hours, he said he retrieved the plates and hid them in a hollow log on or near Cumorah. 61 At the same time, Joseph said he received a pair of large spectacles he called the &quot;Urim and Thummim&quot; or &quot;Interpreters&quot;, with lenses consisting of two seer stones, which he showed his mother when he returned in the morning. 62
Over the next few days, Smith took a well-digging job in nearby Macedon to obtain money to buy a solid lockable chest in which he said he would put the plates. 63 By then, however, some of Smith's treasure-seeking company had heard that Smith was successful in obtaining the plates, and they wanted what they believed was their cut of the profits from what they saw as part of their joint venture. 64 Spying once again on the house of Samuel Lawrence, Smith, Sr. determined that a group of ten to twelve of these men, including Lawrence and Willard Chase, had enlisted the talents of a renowned and supposedly-talented seer from sixty miles away, in an effort to locate where the plates were hidden by means of divination. 65 When Emma heard of this, she rode a stray horse to Macedon and informed Smith, Jr., 66 who reportedly determined through his Urim and Thummim that the plates were safe, but nevertheless he hurriedly rode home with Emma. 67 Once home in Manchester, he walked to Cumorah and said he removed the plates from their hiding place, and walked back home through the woods, away from the road, with the plates wrapped in a linen frock under his arm. 68 . On the way, he said he suffered a &quot;heavy blow with a gun&quot; by a man who had been hiding behind a log, and blows from two other attackers. 69 His family said he returned home with a dislocated thumb, an injured arm, and an injury to his side 70 and he sent his father, Joseph Knight, and Josiah Stowell to search for the pursuers, but they found nobody. 71 Smith then put the plates in a locked chest and hid it in his parent's home in Manchester. 72
Smith refused to allow anyone, including his family, to view the plates or other artifacts directly. Some people, however, were allowed to heft them or feel them through a cloth. 73 A few days after retrieving the plates, Smith brought home what he said was an ancient breastplate, which had been hidden in the box at Cumorah with the plates, let his mother feel it through a thin cloth, then placed it in the locked chest with the plates and the Urim and Thummim. 74
The Smith home was approached &quot;nearly every night&quot; by villagers hoping to find the plates on their property. 75 After word that a group of people would be attempting to enter the home by force, Smith buried the chest under the hearth, 76 but the family was able to scare away the approaching intruders. 77 Fearing it might be discovered, however, Smith hid the chest under the floor boards of his parents' old log home nearby, then used as a cooper shop. 78 Later, Smith said he took the plates out of the chest, left the empty chest under the floor boards of the cooper shop, and hid the plates in a barrel of flax, not long before the location of the empty box was discovered and the place ransacked by Smith's former treasure-seeking associates, 79 who had enlisted one of the men's sisters to find that location by looking in her seer stone. 80
Translating the plates

Most of the translation of the golden plates took place in Harmony, Pennsylvania (now located in Oakland Township), where Smith and Emma moved in October 1827 with the financial assistance from a prominent, though superstitious, Palmyra landowner Martin Harris. 81 Harmony was Emma's home town. The work of translation took place in two phases: the first was a period from December 1827 to June 1828 in which Smith transcribed some of the characters and then dictated a translation to Martin Harris. The 116 manuscript pages from this period, however, were lost. The second phase of translation began sporadically in early 1829, and then in earnest in April 1829 with the arrival of Oliver Cowdery, a schoolteacher willing to work full-time as his scribe. In June 1829, Smith and Cowdery moved to Fayette, New York and finished the translation around the beginning of July 1829.
Location of the plates during translation
When Joseph and Emma traveled to Pennsylvania in October 1827, the golden plates were said to be transported in a glass box hidden in a barrel of beans. 82 In Harmony, the couple stayed for a time in the home of Emma's father Isaac Hale, but when Smith refused to show Hale the plates, only allowing him to heft the containing box, Hale banished the concealed object from his house. 83 Afterwards, the plates were said to be hidden for much of the time in the woods nearby, 84 although Emma said that for at least part of the time, Joseph kept the plates in the house, on a table, wrapped in a linen tablecloth, which she moved from time to time when it got in the way of her chores. 85 In one instance, the plates were said to be in a trunk on Emma's bureau. 86 Smith did not require the physical presence of the plates in order to translate. 87
In April 1828, Harris' wife Lucy visited Harmony with her husband and demanded to see the plates. When Smith refused, she searched the Smith house and grounds for the plates, but they had been hidden in the nearby woods, and were protected by a large black snake that frightened her and reportedly prevented her from digging them up. 88 Lucy was soon allegedly involved in the loss of the loss of 116 pages of translation manuscript in July 1828, which had been loaned to Martin so that he could prove to his friends and family that the plates were real.
Because of the lost 116 pages, Smith said that between July and September 1828, the angel Moroni took back possession of the plates and the Urim and Thummim as a penalty for &quot;delivering the manuscript into the hands of a wicked man.&quot; 89 The angel is said to have returned them to Smith in Harmony again on September 22, 1828, the autumn equinox and the anniversary of the day he first received the plates. 90
In March 1829, Martin Harris visited Harmony and asked to see the plates firsthand. Smith did not show him the plates directly, but told him that he &quot;would go into the woods where the Book of Plates was, and that after he came back, Harris should follow his tracks in the snow, and find the Book, and examine it for himself&quot;; after following these directions, however, Harris could not find the plates. 91
In early June 1829, the unwanted attentions of Harmony locals necessitated a move to Fayette, New York, to the home of David Whitmer and his parents. As they traveled, the golden plates were reportedly transported by the angel Moroni, who received the plates in Harmony and then placed them in the garden of the Whitmer house in Fayette, where Smith found them. 92
After translation was completed, Smith said he returned the plates to the angel, 93 although the angel periodically brought them, as needed, to show several witnesses. Many Latter Day Saints, including Brigham Young, have believed the plates were returned to Hill Cumorah and that other ancient records lie buried there, including the Sword of Laban and the special spectacles given to aid the translation process. 94
Translation process
Smith said he copied characters from the golden plates and translated them through the use of &quot;Urim and Thummim&quot; found with the plates. 95 Emma Smith later recalled that when she took dictation from her husband, she &quot;frequently wrote day after day, often sitting at the table close by him, he sitting with his face buried in his hat, with the stone in it, and dictating hour after hour with nothing between us.... The plates often lay on the table without any attempt at concealment, wrapped in a small linen table cloth, which I had given him to fold them in. I once felt of the plates as they thus lay on the table tracing their outline and shape. They seemed to be pliable like thick paper, and would rustle with a metallic sound when the edges were moved by the thumb, as one does sometimes thumb the edges of a book.&quot;96
Usually, however, the golden plates were not even in the same room. Michael Morse, Smith's brother-in-law, said that he watched Smith on several occasions:&quot;The mode of procedure consisted in Joseph's placing the Seer Stone in the crown of a hat, then putting his face into the hat, so as to entirely cover his face.&quot; David Whitmer said that &quot;the plates were not before Joseph while he translated, but seem to have been removed by the custodian angel.&quot; Isaac Hale said that while Joseph was translating, the plates were &quot;hid in the woods.&quot; Joseph Smith, Sr. said they were &quot;hid in the mountains.&quot;97 During the translation process a curtain or blanket was placed between Smith and his scribe or between the living area and the area where Smith and his scribe worked.98 Sometimes Smith dictated to Martin Harris from upstairs or from a different room.99
Smith used a number of assistants during the process of translating the Book of Mormon, including Emma Smith, Martin Harris, and most notably, Oliver Cowdery. Nevertheless, Smith's translation process did not involve his understanding of an ancient script. As he looked into the seer stone, the words of the text appeared to him in English.100 When in mid-1828, Smith loaned the manuscript pages to Martin Harris, and Harris lost them, Smith said that opponents would try to see if he could &quot;bring forth the same words again.&quot; Smith did not explain why he believed different translations of a text should not be different or why a fraudulent version with different handwriting would not be obvious.101
Plates returned to Moroni
Once the translation was complete, about July 1829, Smith said that he returned the plates to the angel.102 Many Latter Day Saints, including Brigham Young, have believed the plates were returned to Hill Cumorah and that other ancient records lie buried there, including the Sword of Laban and the Urim and Thummim given to aid the translation process.103
Witnesses to the plates

As Smith finished the translation of the plates, he revealed that witnesses would be asked to testify to their existence. In June 1829, two sets of witnesses, the Three Witnesses104 and a separate group of Eight Witnesses,105 signed joint statements, written by Smith, which were subsequently published with the text of the Book of Mormon.106 The Three Witnesses — Oliver Cowdery, David Whitmer, and Martin Harris — affirmed that an angel had descended from heaven and presented the plates, which they saw but did not touch. Then they heard a voice from heaven declaring that the book was translated by the power of God and that they should bear record of it. The Eight Witnesses were members of the Joseph Smith and David Whitmer families. Like the Three Witnesses, the Eight signed a joint statement that they had seen and, in their case, hefted the plates.107
In March 1838, disillusioned church members said that Martin Harris, who had given many specific descriptions of the plates, had now publicly denied having seen them at all.108 Near the end of his long life, Harris also said that he had seen the plates only in &quot;a state of entrancement.&quot;109 Nevertheless, in 1871 Harris testified that no one had &quot;ever heard me in any way deny the truth of the Book of Mormon [or] the administration of the angel that showed me the plates.&quot;110 Yet even after Smith had returned the plates to the angel, other early LDS Church members testified that an angel had also showed them the plates.111
Physical description of the plates
Format, binding, and dimensions

Full-scale model of the Golden Plates based on Joseph Smith's description.

The plates were said to be in the format of a book, bound at one edge by a set of rings. Martin Harris, one of Joseph Smith, Jr.'s early scribes, is reported to have said in 1828 that he understood the plates were &quot;fastened together in the shape of a book by wires&quot;112 After saying that he saw the plates in 1829, Harris said in 1859 that the plates &quot;were seven inches wide by eight inches in length, and were of the thickness of plates of tin; and when piled one above the other, they were altogether about four inches thick; and they were put together on the back by three silver rings, so that they would open like a book.&quot;113 David Whitmer, another 1829 witness, was quoted in a 1831 Palmyra newspaper as saying the plates were &quot;the thickness of tin plate; the back was secured with three small rings...passing through each leaf in succession.&quot;114 Anomalously, Smith's father is quoted as saying the plates were only half an inch thick 115 Smith's mother, who said she had &quot;seen and handled&quot; the plates, is quoted as saying they were &quot;eight inches long, and six wide,... all connected by a ring which passes through a hole at the end of each plate.&quot;116
Hyrum Smith and John Whitmer, also witnesses in 1829, are reported to have stated that the rings holding the plates together were, in Hyrum's words, &quot;in the shape of the letter D, which facilitated the opening and shutting of the book&quot;.117 Joseph Smith's wife Emma, and his younger brother William said they examined the plates while they were wrapped in fabric. Emma said she &quot;felt of the plates, as they thus lay on the table, tracing their outline and shape. They seemed to be pliable like thick paper, and would rustle with a metallic sound when the edges were moved by the thumb, as one does sometimes thumb the edges of a book&quot;.118 William agreed that the plates could be rustled with one's thumb like the pages of a book.119
Joseph Smith did not provide his own published description of the plates until 1842, when he said in a letter that &quot;each plate was six inches [150 mm] wide and eight inches [200 mm] long, and not quite so thick as common tin. They were...bound together in a volume, as the leaves of a book, with three rings running through the whole. The volume was something near six inches [150 mm] in thickness.&quot;120
Composition and weight
The plates were first described as &quot;gold.&quot; Beginning about 1827, the plates were widely called the &quot;gold bible&quot;.121 When the book was published in 1830, eight witnesses described the plates as having &quot;the appearance of gold.&quot;122 The Book of Mormon itself describes the plates as being made of &quot;ore.&quot;123 In 1831, a Palmyra newspaper quoted David Whitmer, another witness to the plates, as saying the plates were a &quot;whitish yellow color,&quot; with &quot;three small rings of the same metal.&quot;124
Joseph Smith, Jr.'s first published description of the plates agreed that the plates &quot;had the appearance of gold.&quot;125 but gave no further information about their composition. Late in life, Martin Harris stated that the rings holding the plates together were made of silver,126 and he said the plates themselves, based on their heft of &quot;forty or fifty pounds,&quot;127 &quot;were lead or gold.&quot;128 Joseph's brother William Smith, who said he felt the plates inside a pillow case in 1827, said in 1884 that he understood the plates to be &quot;a mixture of gold and copper...much heavier than stone, and very much heavier than wood.&quot;129
Different people estimated the weight of the plates differently. According to Smith's one-time-friend Willard Chase, Smith told him in 1827 that the plates weighed between forty and sixty pounds, most likely the latter.130 Smith's father Joseph Smith, Sr., who was one of the Eight Witnesses, reportedly weighed them and said in 1830 that they &quot;weighed thirty pounds.&quot;131 Joseph Smith's brother, William, said that he lifted them in a pillowcase and thought they &quot;weighed about sixty pounds according to the best of my judgment.&quot;132 Others who lifted the plates while they were wrapped in cloth or enclosed in a box thought that they weighed about sixty pounds. Martin Harris said that he had &quot;hefted the plates many times, and should think they weighed forty or fifty pounds.&quot; 133 Joseph Smith's wife Emma never estimated the weight of the plates but said they were light enough for her to &quot;move them from place to place on the table, as it was necessary in doing my work&quot;.134 Had the plates been made of 24-karat gold (which Smith never claimed), they would have weighed about 140 pounds.135
The plates might have been made from tin or various gold alloys. They might have been made of a gold and copper Mesoamerican alloy, called tumbaga by the Spanish, which would have weighed between 50 and 70 pounds.136 Plates of roughly similar dimensions and weight might also have been made of tin, which was readily available in the Palmyra area.137
&quot;Sealed&quot; portion
According to Joseph Smith and others, the book of Golden Plates contained a &quot;sealed&quot; portion 138 containing &quot;a revelation from God, from the beginning of the world to the ending thereof.&quot;139 Although Smith never personally described the nature or extent of the seal, witnesses have offered several descriptions. The language of the Book of Mormon is interpreted by many to describe a sealing of the plates that was spiritual, metaphorical,140 physical, or any combination of these elements.
The Book of Mormon refers to other documents and plates being &quot;sealed&quot; by being buried to come forth at some future time. For example, the Book of Mormon says the entire set of plates was &quot;sealed up, and hid up unto the Lord&quot;,141 and that a separate record of John the Apostle was &quot;sealed up to come forth in their purity&quot; in the end times.142 One set of plates referred to in the Book of Mormon was &quot;sealed up&quot; in the sense that &quot;no one can interpret them,&quot; because they were written &quot;in a language that they cannot be read.&quot;143
Smith may also have understood the sealing as a supernatural or spiritual sealing of the plates &quot;by the power of God&quot; (2 Nephi 27:10).144 This idea is supported by a reference in the Book of Mormon to the &quot;interpreters&quot; (Urim and Thummim) with which Smith said they were buried or &quot;sealed.&quot;Book of Mormon, Ether 4:5
Engravings


A transcription by Joseph Smith, Jr. of characters he said were engraved on the Golden Plates.

The Golden Plates were said to contain engravings in an ancient language that the Book of Mormon describes as Reformed Egyptian.145 Smith later described them as &quot;Egyptian characters...small, and beautifully engraved,&quot; exhibiting &quot;much skill in the art of engraving.&quot;146
According to John Whitmer, one of the Eight Witnesses who said he saw the plates in 1829, the plates had &quot;fine engravings on both sides&quot;.147 Orson Pratt, who did not see the plates himself, who had spoken with the witnesses, understood that there were engravings on both sides of the plates, &quot;stained with a black, hard stain, so as to make the letters more legible and easier to be read.&quot;148
Metal plates in Latter Day Saint theology and history
Other metal plates mentioned in the Book of Mormon
In addition to the Golden Plates, the Book of Mormon refers to several other sets of books written on metal plates:

The brass plates originally in the custody of Laban, containing the writings of Old Testament prophets before the Babylonian Exile, as well as the otherwise unknown prophets Zenos and Zenoch, and possibly others.
The large plates of Nephi, the source of the text abridged by Mormon and engraved on the Golden Plates.
The small plates of Nephi, the source of the first and second books of Nephi, and the books of Jacob, Enos, Jarom and Omni, which replaced the lost 116 pages.
A set of twenty-four plates found by the people of Limhi containing the record of the Jaredites, translated by King Mosiah, and abridged by Moroni as the Book of Ether.

Other metal plates in the Latter Day Saint Tradition

In 1843, Smith acquired a set of six small bell-shaped plates, known as the Kinderhook Plates, found in Kinderhook, Pike County, Illinois. Smith said that they contained information about a descendant of Ham &quot;through the loins of Pharaoh,&quot; but he never produced a translation. After Smith's assassination, the Kinderhook Plates were presumed lost, but for decades The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints published facsimiles of them in its official History of the Church as evidence that ancient Americans wrote on metal plates. In 1980 the Kinderhook Plates were proved to have been manufactured in the nineteenth century, probably in an attempt to catch Smith in a fraud. Today the LDS Church acknowledges the plates as a hoax and makes no attempt to defend their authenticity.149


James J. Strang, one of the rival claimants to succeed Smith, also claimed to have discovered and translated a set of plates known as the Voree Plates. Strang likewise produced witnesses to their authenticity. Although Strang's movement was short-lived, Joseph Smith's mother, Lucy Mack Smith, and all living witnesses to the Book of Mormon, including the three Whitmers and Martin Harris (although perhaps excluding Oliver Cowdery), accepted &quot;Strang's leadership, angelic call, metal plates, and his translation of these plates as authentic.&quot;150

Metal plates outside the Latter Day Saint tradition

the Pyrgi Tablets 

Mormons often treat inscribed metal plates outside the Latter Day Saint tradition as evidence that the Golden Plates were actual historical artifacts. Some ancient European and Mesopotamian cultures did keep short records on metal plates, but those found to date have been extremely thin to facilitate being engraved with a pointed tool. In 500 BCE, Darius the Great of Persia inscribed a history on a gold plate and sealed it in a stone box in the temple at Persepolis.151 A six-page, 24-carat gold book, written in Etruscan, was found in Bulgaria;152and in 2005, an eight-page golden codex, said to be from the Achaemenid period, was recovered from smugglers by the Iranian police. The Pyrgi Tablets (now at the National Etruscan Museum, Rome) are gold plates with a bilingual Phoenician-Etruscan text. Gold Laminae funerary texts similar to Books of the Dead have also been found in Italy. In the caves where the Dead Sea Scrolls had been found, archeologists later discovered the aptly-named Copper Scroll, two rolled sheets of copper that may describe locations where treasures of the Second Temple of Jerusalem may have been hidden.153 Nevertheless, there is no known extant example of writing on metal plates longer than the eight-page Persian codex.

Use of the terms golden bible and gold bible by both believers and non-believers dates from the late 1820s. See, for instance,  (use of the term Gold Bible by Martin Harris in 1827);  (use of the term gold Bible in 1827&lt;U+2013&gt;29 by believing Palmyra neighbors);  (stating that by 1829 the plates were &quot;generally known and spoken of as the 'Golden Bible'&quot;). Use of these terms has been rare, especially by believers, since the 1830s.↩

September 22 was listed in a local almanac as the autumnal equinox, which has led to the suggestion that the date had astrological significance according to Smith's worldview (; ). A Palmyra minister said that Martin Harris told him in 1827 that Smith had been on a treasure-hunting excursion earlier the night of the angel's first visit..↩
Smith's first mention of the angel in later histories is an appearance on the eve of September 22 1823 ; however, other accounts say or infer that the angel may have appeared a year earlier in 1822. Smith's first history in 1832 said the angel's first visit was on September 22 1822, although he also said he was &quot;seventeen years of age&quot; , which would have made the year 1823 (he turned 17 in December 1822). In 1835, after Oliver Cowdery initially dated the angel's visit to the &quot;15th year of our brother J. Smith Jr's, age,&quot; he corrected the statement to read the 17th year of his age (16 years old, or 1822) &lt;U+2014&gt;but he said this visit in Smith's &quot;17th year&quot; occurred in 1823 . Smith's father is quoted by an inquirer who visited his house in 1830 as saying that the first visit by the angel took place in 1822 but that he did not learn about it until 1823 . A Smith neighbor who said Smith told him the story in 1823 said the angel appeared &quot;a year or two before&quot; the death of Joseph's brother Alvin in November 1823.↩
.↩
Smith referred to the visitor as an &quot;angel of the Lord&quot; at least as early as 1832 . Some early accounts related by non-Mormons described this angel as a &quot;spirit&quot; (; ; ) or a &quot;ghost&quot; (; see also a later-published account using the &quot;ghost&quot; terminology: ). In 1838, however, Smith later said that the &quot;angel&quot; was a man who had been &quot;dead, and raised again therefrom&quot; .↩
; . Contrary to his other statements, Smith's 1838 autobiography said that the angel was Nephi ; nevertheless, modern historians and Latter Day Saints generally refer to the angel as Moroni.↩

Smith's mother Lucy Mack Smith said he was commanded to tell his father during the third vision , but he disobeyed because he didn't think his father would believe him, and the angel appeared a fourth time to rebuke him and reiterate the commandment (p. 82). Joseph Smith and his sister Katharine said the angel gave him the commandment in his fourth visit, but did not say whether he had received the commandment earlier that night (; ). Smith's father is quoted by a skeptical interviewer to say that in 1830, Smith delayed telling his father about the vision for about a year . Smith's brother William, who was 11 at the time, said the angel commanded him to tell his entire family , although he may have been remembering Smith tell the story that night after he visited the hill, according to their mother's recollection .↩
 (saying he was commanded to &quot;have an eye single to the glory of God&quot;);  (saying the angel commanded him to &quot;have no other object in view in getting the plates but to glorify God.&quot;)↩
This commandment is described in the account of Joseph Knight, Sr., a loyal Latter Day Saint friend of Smith's , and Willard Chase, an associate of Smith's in Palmyra during the 1820s . Both Knight and Chase were treasure seekers, but while Knight remained a loyal to his death, Chase was a critic of Smith's by the early 1830s.↩
There is agreement on this commandment by Smith's mother  and sister  and by two non-Mormons (; ).↩

 (an affidavit of Willard Chase, a non-Latter Day Saint treasure seeker who believed Smith wrongly appropriated his seer stone). Chase said he heard the story from Smith's father in 1827. Fayette Lapham, who traveled to Palmyra in 1830 to inquire about the Latter Day Saint movement and heard the story from Joseph Smith, Sr., said Smith was told to wear an &quot;old-fashioned suit of clothes, of the same color&quot; as those worn by the angel,&quot; but Lapham did not specify what color of clothing the angel was wearing .↩

Most accounts, including those written by Smith, say the plates were found in a stone box (; ); according to two non-believing witnesses, however, Smith said they were buried in an iron box (; ).↩

According to various accounts, these artifacts may have included a breastplate (; ; , saying it was the &quot;breast-plate of &quot;), a set of large spectacles made of seer stones (; ; ), the Liahona, the sword of Laban (; ), the brass plates of Laban , the vessel in which the gold was melted, a rolling machine for gold plates, and three balls of gold as large as a fist .↩

In Smith's 1838 autobiography, he said the angel told him the previous night that retrieving the plates would require four yearly visits, and therefore he already knew his first three visits would not result in him obtaining the plates .↩

Oliver Cowdery, writing for a church periodical with Smith's assistance, said Smith was stricken three times with an ever increasing force, persisting after the second time because he thought the plates were held by the power of an &quot;enchantment&quot; (like hidden-treasure stories he had heard) that could be overcome by physical exertion . Smith's mother said he was stricken by a force but did not say how many times . Willard Chase said Smith was stricken at least twice . Fayette Lapham, who said he heard the story in about 1830 from Smith's father, said Smith was stricken three times with ever-increasing force . Two neighbors who heard the story from Smith in Harmony in the late 1820s said Smith was knocked down three times .

In Smith's 1838 account he said the angel had already told him he would not receive the plates for another four years . Smith's brother, who was 11 at the time, said &quot;upon his return [he] told us that in consequence of his not obeying strictly the commandments which the angel had given him, he could not obtain the record until four years from that time&quot; . Smith's sister Katharine (who was 10 at the time) said that Moroni told him, &quot;You have not obeyed the commandments as you were commanded to; you must obey His commandments in every particular.

The hill opened and they walked into a cave where there was a spacious room with wagon loads of metallic plates and the Sword of Laban, unsheathed on a large table. Joseph and Oliver placed the plates on this table.↩
The Three Witnesses were selected soon after a visit by Martin Harris to the Whitmer home in Fayette, accompanied by Smith's parents , to inquire about the translation . According to Smith's mother, this trip was prompted by news that Smith had completed the translation of the plates. When Harris he arrived, he joined with Oliver Cowdery and David Whitmer to request that the three be named as the Three Witnesses referred to in the much earlier revelation directed to Harris, and also referred to in a recently-translated portion of the plates called the Book of Ether (2:2&lt;U+2013&gt;4) . In response, Smith dictated a revelation that the three of them would see the Golden Plates . Thus, Smith took the three of them to the woods near the Whitmer home and they had a shared vision in which they all claimed to see (with their &quot;spiritual eyes&quot;, Harris reportedly said ) an angel holding the Golden Plates and turning its leaves (; ). The four of them also said they heard &quot;the voice of the Lord&quot; telling them that the translation of the plates was correct, and commanding them to testify of what they saw and heard (; ).David Whitmer later stated that the angel showed them &quot;the breast plates, the Ball or Directors, the Sword of Laban and other plates&quot; (; ; see also ).↩
The Eight Witnesses were selected a few days later when Smith traveled to Palmyra with the males of the Whitmer home, including David Whitmer's father Peter, his brothers Christian, Jacob, and John, and his brother-in-law Hiram Page. Smith took this group, along with his father Joseph Smith, Sr. and his brothers Hyrum and Samuel to a location near Smith's parent's home in Palmyra . Because of a foreclosure on their Manchester property, the Smith family was then living in a log cabin technically in Palmyra (; ) where Smith said he showed them the Golden Plates . Like the Three Witnesses, the Eight Witnesses later signed an affidavit for inclusion at the end of the Book of Mormon . Though the Eight Witnesses did not refer, like the Three, to an angel or the voice of God, they said that they had hefted the plates and seen the engravings on them .↩

Joseph Smith letterbook (22 Nov. 1835 to 4 Aug. 1835), 5-6. Commentators generally agree that this letter refers to the revelation. See Larry C. Porter, &quot;Dating the Restoration of the Melchizedek Priesthood,&quot; Ensign (June 1979), 5. A revelation by Smith commanded Cowdery and Whitmer to seek out twelve &quot;disciples&quot;, who desired to serve, and who would &quot;go into all the world to preach my gospel unto every creature&quot;, and who would be ordained to baptize and to ordain priests and teachers . Soon thereafter in the second half of June 1829 , a group of Three Witnesses and a separate group of Eight Witnesses were selected, in addition to Smith himself, to testify that Smith had the Golden Plates.↩
&quot;The translator of this work, has shown unto us the plates of which hath been spoken, which have the appearance of gold; and as many of the leaves as the said Smith has translated we did handle with our hands; and we also saw the engravings thereon, all of which has the appearance of ancient work, and of curious workmanship.&quot;↩
Their accounts state that Harris publicly denied that either he or the other Witnesses to the Book of Mormon had ever seen or handled the golden plates&lt;U+2014&gt;although he had not been present when Whitmer and Cowdery first claimed to have viewed them. Harris's recantation, made during a period of crisis in early Mormonism, induced five influential members, including three Apostles, to leave the Church. (Stephen Burnett to Luke S. Johnson, 15 April 1838, in Joseph Smith's Letterbook, Early Mormon Documents 2: 290-92. Warren Parrish also wrote in August 11, 1838: &quot;Martin Harris, one of the subscribing witnesses, has come out at last, and says he never saw the plates, from which the book purports to have been translated, except in vision, and he further says that any man who says he has seen them in any other way is a liar, Joseph not excepted.&quot; EMD, 2: 289.)↩
