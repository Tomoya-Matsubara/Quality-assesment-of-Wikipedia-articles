Ringo's Rotogravure is the fifth album by Ringo Starr, released in 1976. It would turn out to be the last album featuring active involvement from all four former Beatles before John Lennon's death in 1980. Following the end of his contract with EMI, Starr signed on with Polydor Records worldwide (Atlantic Records handling US distribution).
Background and recording
It was reported in December 1975 that ABC Records in the US was to sign former-Beatle Ringo Starr for a 5-year recording contract, worth $5 million.1 However, on 26 January 1976, when Starr's recording contract with EMI ended, he signed with Atlantic for the US and Polydor for the UK, on 10 March.2 As stated in the deal, Starr was expected to release 7 albums within 5 years, with the first album planned for release in June.3 This session would be Lennon's last until 1980.4

Two years on from 1974's Goodnight Vienna, Starr &lt;U+2212&gt; armed with new producer Arif Mardin &lt;U+2212&gt; again stuck to his tried-and-true formula of having friends write songs and play on the recordings. This time, Eric Clapton took part, in addition to his old friend Harry Nilsson, and Peter Frampton, Melissa Manchester, Dr. John, and former Beatles John Lennon, Paul McCartney and George Harrison.5 Sessions began in April at Sunset Sound Recorders in Los Angeles,6 and eventually moved on 12 June to Cherokee Recording Studios.7 Starr is joined at this session by Lennon and his wife Yoko Ono, recording &quot;A Dose of Rock 'n' Roll&quot;, which features Lennon on piano,8 and the Lennon-penned &quot;Cookin' (In the Kitchen of Love)&quot;.910 The latter of which was written specifically for Starr.11
McCartney, while on break from his Wings Over America tour with Wings, made the backing track to &quot;Pure Gold&quot; along with his wife Linda McCartney, which McCartney got Starr to sing over,12 on 19 June.13 The song had been influenced by Starr's then-girlfriend Nancy Andrews,14 with whom he co-wrote &quot;Las Brisas&quot;.15 Harrison donated a song too, but because of his commitments to get his album Thirty Three &amp; 1/3 done on schedule, he couldn't take part in any recording for Ringo's Rotogravure.1617 Harrison's contribution was a song previously known as &quot;When Every Song Is Sung&quot;,18 which he had attempted to record first with Ronnie Spector in 1971, then with Cilla Black (on which Starr also played), and later still with Leon Russell's wife Mary.19 Eric Clapton played guitar on the track &quot;This Be Called a Song&quot;.20 Several unreleased tracks were recorded during the sessions: &quot;Where Are You Going&quot;, &quot;All Right&quot; and &quot;It's Hard to Be Lovers&quot;.21
Release

Ringo's Rotogravure was released on 17 September 1977 in the UK,{{#tag:ref|UK Polydor Deluxe 2302 04022|group=&quot;nb&quot;}}23 to a lukewarm response. Despite letting him record the song, Harrison was not pleased with Starr's version of &quot;I'll Still Love You&quot;, and proceeded to take legal action against Starr, which was soon settled out of court.24 The album's title was inspired from a movie Starr watched three years prior, titled Easter Parade.25 At the time living as a UK tax exile, Starr promotes the album with interviews in Denmark, France and Italy.26 The album was packaged with a free magnifying glass so that those who bought the album could read the graffiti that was featured on the album's back cover.27
The &quot;A Dose of Rock 'n' Roll&quot; single, backed with &quot;Cryin'&quot;, on 20 September in the US,28 reaching number 26.29 Released in the US on 27 September,{{#tag:ref|US Atlantic SD 1819330|group=&quot;nb&quot;}}31 the album performed poorly, only reaching number 28 in America and quickly falling off the charts, while it never even appeared in the UK charts. The promotional film for &quot;You Don't Know Me at All&quot; aired on Dutch TV, in Holland, on the show Voor De Vuist Weg.32 On 15 October the &quot;A Dose of Rock 'n' Roll&quot; single was released in the UK.3334 In between this and the next single, Starr records the track &quot;I Can Hear You Calling&quot; at Atlantic Studios on 15 October.35 The follow-up single, his cover of Bruce Channel's &quot;Hey Baby&quot;, backed with &quot;Lady Gaye&quot;, was released on 22 November in the US and stalled at number 74.36 The single was released in the UK on 29 November.37 A single comprising &quot;Las Brisas&quot; and &quot;Cryin'&quot; was released in Mexico.
