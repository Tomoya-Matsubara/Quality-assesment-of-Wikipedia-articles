Beau Dick (November 23, 1955)1 is a Canadian Northwest Coast Native artist of Kwakwaka'wakw descent. He currently resides in Alert Bay, BC, Canada.2
Life &amp; Career
Beau was born in Kingcome Inlet, BC, a remote Kwakwaka&lt;U+2019&gt;wakw village north of Vancouver Island before moving to Vancouver, BC at age 6. From a young age he was heavily influenced by the traditional carving work of both his grandfather and father, with whom he assisted in carving one of the world&lt;U+2019&gt;s tallest totem poles in Alert Bay, BC. At age 17 he was asked to apprentice under artist Tony Hunt in Victoria, BC. Eventually returning to Vancouver, he continued to hone his carving techniques under the influence of Doug Cranmer.3
In 1986, Beau was commissioned to carve a mask to be showcased in Expo &lt;U+2019&gt;86, held in Vancouver. The piece was subsequently placed in the Canadian Museum of Civilization in Hull, Quebec where it remains on display.4 In 1998, he was one of only seven Canadian artists to be invited to the reopening of Canada House in London, England, in the presence of Prime Minister Jean Chretien and Queen Elizabeth II.5
In the last decade, his work has been featured in a number of international exhibitions, helping introduce his pieces to a more contemporary audience. Beau's work was featured alongside that of artist Neil Campbell in the 2004 exhibition &quot;Supernatural - Beau Dick and Neil Campbell&quot; at the Contemporary Art Gallery in Vancouver, followed by the 2005 &quot;Totems to Turquoise&quot; exhibit in both New York and Vancouver. In 2009, the McMichael Canadian Art Collection showcased Beau's work in their exhibit entitled &quot;Challenging Traditions: Contemporary First Nations Art of the Northwest Coast&quot;. Most recently, he was invited to display his art at the 2010 Biennale of Sydney in Sydney, Australia.
Artistry
Beau's craftsmanship and artistry have been noted for being strongly influenced by traditional pieces and techniques, but are particularly unique for their incorporation of contemporary and Western influences as well. As noted by artist Roy Arden, many of Beau&lt;U+2019&gt;s designs &lt;U+201C&gt;reminds [me] of Japanese anime characters and commercial Halloween masks&lt;U+2026&gt;.an influence from a European painting, or a Japanese Noh mask, are equally likely to inflect on one of his works.&lt;U+201D&gt;6
Activism
On February 10, 2013, Beau performed a traditional copper-cutting ceremony on the steps of the BC Legislature in Victoria in conjunction with a variety of activists, including local members of Idle No More. Having embarked on a 10-day, 500 km walk from Alert Bay to Victoria, the gesture was intended to bring attention to the abuse of Native treaties by the federal government, as well as highlight the negative repercussions of commercial fish farms on Vancouver Island.7 8
The ceremony was noted as being the first time such a shaming practice had been used by the Kwakwaka&lt;U+2019&gt;wakw in decades.9
