Introduction
Abstral is a formulation of fentanyl citrate available as a sublingual tablet.1 It dissolves quickly2 and is absorbed through the sublingual mucosa to provide rapid analgesia. In the UK, Abstral is licensed for the treatment of breakthrough cancer pain (BTcP) in patients with otherwise stable, baseline persistent pain that is managed with conventional opioids.3
The active constituent of Abstral is fentanyl, which is classified as a controlled Class A drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 in the UK.4
When used under license, fentanyl is a highly lipophilic compound,56 which is well absorbed sublingually7 and generally well tolerated.8 Other pharmaceutical preparations licensed for breakthrough cancer pain in the UK, which contain fentanyl are: Actiq, Effentora, Instanyl and PecFent.9 Abstral is manufactured and marketed by ProStrakan.
Currently, patients receive conventional oral opioids (e.g. morphine) to treat their breakthrough cancer pain episodes. However, the pharmacokinetic profile of conventional opioids does not fit the profile of breakthrough cancer pain. A breakthrough cancer pain episode is rapid in onset, short in duration and severe in intensity,10 while an opioid such as morphine is slow in onset and long in duration. This necessitated the development of specialised, fast-acting fentanyl preparations.
Administration
Approximately 100 times more potent than morphine, Abstral is licensed for opioid-tolerant individuals who require relief from a breakthrough cancer pain episode.11 An Abstral tablet is administered by placing it beneath the tongue, and allowing it to dissolve.12 Abstral is rapidly absorbed through the oral mucosa over approximately 30 minutes following administration. The bioavailability of Abstral has not been studied but is estimated to be about 70%. Mean maximal plasma concentrations of Abstral range from 0.2 to 1.3 ng/ml (after administration of 100 to 800 &lt;U+00B5&gt;g Abstral) and are reached within 22.5 to 240 minutes.13
Dosing
The dose of Abstral required to treat a breakthrough cancer pain episode will vary from person to person. In order to find the most appropriate dose, each individual must undergo a process of dose titration. The aim is to identify an optimal maintenance dose for ongoing treatment of breakthrough cancer pain episodes, with an acceptable level of adverse reactions.
Abstral is available in 6 dosages: 100&lt;U+00B5&gt;g, 200&lt;U+00B5&gt;g, 300&lt;U+00B5&gt;g, 400&lt;U+00B5&gt;g, 600&lt;U+00B5&gt;g, 800&lt;U+00B5&gt;g. Each dosage strength is formulated as a uniquely shaped tablet to minimize confusion.
Efficacy
Much like any other pharmaceutical drug, Abstral has been thoroughly tested in clinical trials. These have identified several characteristics:

Abstral works at all dose strengths14
Abstral can work as quickly as 10 minutes after administration15
Abstral provides pain relief for at least 60 minutes after administration16

Recent studies have suggested that Abstral may work less than 10 minutes after administration.
Side effects
Like all medicines, Abstral has a range of associated adverse effects.17
Very common side effects (affects more than 1 user in 10) include:

Nausea; headache; sleepiness/tiredness; dizziness.

Common side effects (affects 1 to 10 users in 100) include:

Vomiting; diarrhoea; constipation; stomach ache; bloated feeling; indigestion; loss of appetite
Depression; difficulty in concentrating; excessive feeling of well being
Increased sensitivity to sound and noise; blurred or double vision
Low blood pressure; flushing/feeling hot; slow, shallow breathing; feeling weak; feeling faint
Reduced sensitivity to touch; numbness or tingling
Runny or blocked nose; dry mouth; sore throat; itching of the skin; skin rash; irritation under the tongue
