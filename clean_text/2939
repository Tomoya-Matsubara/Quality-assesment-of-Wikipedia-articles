Diderot was one of the six sclass Danton battleship 4 semi-dreadnought battleships built for the French Navy in the late 1900s. Shortly after World War I began, the ship participated in the Battle of Antivari in the Adriatic Sea and helped to sink an Austro-Hungarian protected cruiser. She spent most of the rest of the war blockading the Straits of Otranto and the Dardanelles to prevent German, Austro-Hungarian and Turkish warships from breaking out into the Mediterranean. Diderot briefly participated in the occupation of Constantinople after the end of the war. She was modernized in 192225 and subsequently became a training ship. The ship was condemned in 1936 and later sold for ship breaking scrap.

Design and description
Although the sclass Danton battleship 6s were a significant improvement from the preceding Sclass Libert battleship 4, they were outclassed by the advent of the dreadnought well before they were completed. This, combined with other poor traits, including the great weight in coal they had to carry, made them rather unsuccessful ships, though their numerous rapid-firing guns were of some use in the Mediterranean.Gardiner & Gray, p. 196

Diderot was convert 146.6 m sp=us ftin length overall long overall and had a beam nautical beam of convert 25.8 m sp=us ftin and a full-load draft hull draft of convert 9.2 m sp=us ftin. She displaced convert 19736 MT LT sp=us at deep load and had a crew of 681 officers and enlisted men. The ship was powered by four Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company Parsons steam turbines using steam generated by twenty-six Belleville boilers. The turbines were rated at convert 22500 shp lk=in and provided a top speed of around convert 19 kn lk=in. Diderot, however, reached a top speed of convert 19.9 kn lk=in on her sea trials. She carried a maximum of convert 2027 t LT of coal which allowed her to steam for convert 3370 lk=in nmi at a speed of convert 10 kn.

Diderot's main battery consisted of four 305mm/45 Modle 1906 guns mounted in two twin gun turrets, one forward and one aft. The secondary battery consisted of twelve 240mm/50 Modle 1902 guns in twin turrets, three on each side of the ship. A number of smaller guns were carried for defense against torpedo boats. These included sixteen convert 75 mm abbr=on L/65 guns and ten convert 47 mm abbr=on Hotchkiss guns. The ship was also armed with two submerged convert 450 mm abbr=on 1 torpedo tubes. The ship's waterline belt armor armor belt was convert 270 mm abbr=on 1 thick and the main battery was protected by up to convert 300 mm abbr=on 1 of armor. The conning tower also had 300&nbsp;mm thick sides.

Wartime modifications
During the war 75&nbsp;mm anti-aircraft guns were installed on the roofs of the ship's two forward 240&nbsp;mm gun turrets.Meirat, p. 5 During 1918, the elevation of the 240&nbsp;mm guns was increased which extended their range to convert 18000 m yd sp=us.

Career
Construction of Diderot began on 26 December 1906Gille, p. 120 by Ateliers et Chantiers de la Loire in Saint-Nazaire and the ship was Keel laid down on 20 October 1907. She was Ship naming and launching launched on 19 April 1909 and was completed on 1 August 1911Silverstone, p. 95 The ship was assigned to the First Division of the First Squadron escadre of the Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean France Mediterranean Fleet when she was commissioned. The ship participated in combined fleet maneuvers between Provence and Tunisia in MayJune 1913Gille, p. 119 and the subsequent Review disambiguation naval review conducted by the President of France, Raymond Poincar on 7 June 1913. Afterwards, Diderot joined her squadron in its tour of the Eastern Mediterranean in October-December 1913 and participated in the grand fleet exercise in the Mediterranean in May 1914.

World War I
In early August 1914, the ship cruised the Strait of Sicily in an attempt to prevent the German battlecruiser Goeben and the light cruiser Breslau from breaking out to the West. On 16 August 1914 the combined wikt:Anglo-French Anglo-French Fleet under Admiral Auguste Bou de Lapeyrre, including Voltaire, made a sweep of the Adriatic Sea. The Allied ships encountered the Austro-Hungarian cruiser SMS Zenta, escorted by the destroyer SMS Ulan, blockading the coast of Montenegro. There were too many ships for Zenta to escape, so she remained behind to allow Ulan to get away and was sunk by gunfire during the Battle of Antivari off the coast of Bar, Montenegro. Voltaire subsequently participated in a number of raids into the Adriatic later in the year and patrolled the Ionian Islands. From December 1914 through 1917, the ship participated in the distant blockade of the Straits of Otranto while based in Corfu. In May 1918, Diderot became flagship of the First Division of the Second Squadron and was transferred that month to Mudros with her sister ships, ship French battleship Mirabeau  2 and ship French battleship Vergniaud  2, to prevent Goeben from breaking out into the Mediterranean and remained there until the end of the war.

Postwar
After the Armistice of Mudros was signed on 30 October between the Allies of World War I Allies and the Ottoman Empire, the ship participated in the early stage of the occupation of Constantinople from 12 November to 12 December. Diderot was based in Toulon throughout 1919 and was modernized in 192225 to improve her underwater protection. The ship became a training ship in 1927 and was condemned in 1936. She was later sold for scrap and broken up in 1937.
