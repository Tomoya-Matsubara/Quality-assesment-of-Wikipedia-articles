Renfrew County Council is the governing body of the upper-tier municipality of Renfrew County in Ontario, Canada. This 17-member body is responsible for the government providing services to a population of 97,000.1
Election
Members of council are indirectly elected, as the council is made up the reeves and mayors of the lower-tier municipalities within Renfrew County. The head of County Council is styled as &quot;Warden&quot; and like in all other municipalities in Ontario, has &quot;weak mayor&quot; powers. The Warden is selected by vote of council, and is therefore doubly indirectly elected.
