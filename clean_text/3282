The City & South London Railway C&SLR is considered to be the first deep-level underground tube railway in the world,Wolmar, Christian, p 4 and also the first major railway in the world to use electric traction. When first opened in 1890, it served six stations and ran for a distance of convert 5.1 km mi abbr=on lk=on 1Length of line calculated from distances given at http://www.davros.org/rail/culg/northern.html#layout Clive's Underground Line Guides - Northern Line, Layout.

The diameter of the tunnels restricted the size of the trains and the small carriages with their high backed seating were nicknamed padded cells.
Wolmar, Christian, p 151http://www.20thcenturylondon.org.uk/server.php?show=conObject.3432 Exploring 20th Century London - Padded Cell carriage

The railway was extended a number of times; eventually serving 22 stations over a distance of convert 21.7 km mi abbr=on lk=on 1 from Camden Town in north London to Morden in Surrey. 

In 1913, the C&SLR became part of the Underground Electric Railways Company Underground Group of railways and, in the 1920s, it underwent major reconstruction works prior to its merger with another of the Group's railways. In 1933, the C&SLR and the rest of the Underground Group was taken into public ownership. Today its tunnels and stations form the Northern Line#Morden branch Morden and Northern Line#Bank branch Bank branches of the London Underground's Northern Line.

The railway was to run north from Elephant and Castle, in Southwark, south London, under the River Thames to King William Street London King William Street in the City of London. The tracks were to be placed in twin tunnels 10 foot unit of length ft 2 inch in 3.1 metre m in diameter.Badsey-Ellis, Anthony, p. 35

Haulage and infrastructure
Image:Ltmd-c&slr-number13-01.jpg thumb left 250px C&SLR locomotive number 13 at London's Transport Museum Depot in 2005
Like Greathead's earlier Tower Subway, the CL&SS was originally intended to be operated by cable haulage with a static engine pulling the cable through the tunnels at a steady speed. Badsey-Ellis, Anthony, p. 36 Section 5 of the 1884 Act specified that:
:The traffic of the subway shall be worked by...the system of the Patent Cable Tramway Corporation Limited or by such means other than steam locomotives as the Board of Trade may from time to time approve.
Trains were to be attached to the cable with clamps. These would be opened and closed at stations allowing the carriages to disconnect and reconnect without needing to stop the cable or interfere with the progress of other trains sharing the cable.
Wolmar, Christian, p 135 The additional lengths of tunnels permitted by the supplementary acts challenged the practicality of a cable hauled system and before the problems could be resolved the cable contractor went out of business. Given the small dimension of the tunnels, steam power, used on London's other underground railways, was not feasible and the solution adopted was electrical power provided via a third rail beneath the train. Although, the use of electricity to power trains had been experimented with in the previous decade and small scale operations had been implemented, the C&SLR was the first major railway in the world to adopt it as a means of motive power. The system operated using London Underground electric locomotives#City & South London Railway electric locomotives built by Mather & Platt collecting a electric current current at 500 volts from the third rail and pulling a number of carriages.http://www.davros.org/rail/culg/northern.html#history Clive's Underground Line Guides - Northern Line, History. Retrieved on 20 September 2007. A depot and power station generating station were constructed at Stockwell.The depot and generating station were on the east side of Clapham Road/Kennington Park Road located approximately where Stockwell Gardens is today - As shown on Greathead's plan presented to the Institution of Civil Engineers. The limited capacity of the generators meant that the stations were originally illuminated by gas lighting gas. Wolmar, Christian, p 137 The depot was on the surface and trains requiring maintenance were initially hauled to the surface via a ramp but a elevator lift was soon installed.Wolmar, Christian, p 134 In practice, most rolling stock and locomotives only went to the surface for major maintenance. 

To avoid the need to purchase agreements for running under surface buildings, the tunnels were bored below roadways where construction could be carried out without charge. At the northern end of the railway, the need to pass deep beneath the bed of the River Thames and the middle ages mediaeval street pattern of the City of London constrained the arrangement of the tunnels on the approach to King William Street station. Due to the proximity of the station to the river, steeply inclined tunnels were required to the west of the station. Because of the narrow street under which they ran, they were bored one above the other rather than side by side as elsewhere. The outbound tunnel was the lower and steeper of the two. The tracks came together as a single line immediately before the station which contained a single platform in one large tunnel. The other terminus at Stockwell was also constructed in a single tunnel but with the tracks each side of a central platform. The station was rebuilt in the conventional way with separate tunnels for each platform in the 1920s. The new platforms were placed south of the original and were constructed by enlarging the running tunnels  Connor, J.E, p. 118.

Opening
The railway was opened officially by Edward VII of the United Kingdom Edward, Prince of Wales later Edward VII on 4 November 1890.http://www.berga.nu/Lennart_T/lu/1890s.html Index of Underground History - 1890s. Retrieved on 20 September 2007. The railway was opened to the public on 18 December 1890.http://www.davros.org/rail/culg/northern.html#dates Clive's Underground Line Guides - Northern Line, Dates. Retrieved on 20 September 2007. Initially, it had stations at:
Stockwell tube station Stockwell
Oval tube station The Oval renamed Oval around 1894Rose, Douglas
Kennington tube station Kennington
Elephant & Castle tube station Elephant & Castle
Borough tube station Borough
King William Street tube station King William Street

The original service was operated by trains composed of an engine and three carriages. Thirty two passengers could be accommodated in each carriage which was provided with longitudinal bench seating and sliding doors at the ends, leading onto a platform from which they could board and alight. It was reasoned that there was nothing to look at in the tunnels so the only windows were in a narrow band high up in the carriage sides. Gate-men rode on the carriage platforms to operate the lattice gates and announce the station names to the passengers. Due to their claustrophobia claustrophobic interiors, the carriages soon became known as padded cells. Unlike other railways, there were no ticket classes; at opening, a single flat fare of two British one penny coin pre-decimal pence, collected at a turnstile, was charged for all passengers.

Extensions to Clapham and Islington, 1890 &ndash; 1901
Shortly before it opened to the public, the C&SLR gave notice of its intention to submit another private bill to parliament - this time to construct a new line from its northern terminus at King William Street towards Islington.

 Due to the awkward arrangement of King William Street station, the extension was not to be connected directly to the existing running tunnels but was to be linked via a pedestrian subway through which passengers could make interchanges between the separate lines. The bill was rejected on the grounds that the extension failed to make a connection to the existing line. Badsey-Ellis, Anthony, p. 48  In November 1891, the C&SLR published details of a revised bill for the extension to Islington.

 The company had recognised the deficiencies of its King William Street station and, just a year after the line had opened, planned to construct a new pair of tunnels to bypass the problematic northern section. 

From near Borough station, the new tunnels would branch off and follow a new route via a new station to form an interchange with London Bridge station London Bridge mainline station. The tunnels would then pass to the east of London Bridge, then north through the City of London to The Angel, Islington. Following a delay during which a Joint committee Joint Select Committee reviewed the proposals of a number of new underground railways, Badsey-Ellis, Anthony, p. 68 the City and South London Railway Act, 1893 was approved and received Royal Assent on 24 August 1893.

Construction of the two authorised extensions was delayed whilst funds were raised and plans were finalised. Between 1895 and 1898, three further bills were put before parliament to keep the permissions alive and obtain additional approvals:

Image:Clapham Common Tube Station Platforms - Oct 2007.jpg thumb 300px The narrow central platform at Clapham Common with tracks on both sides dates from the 1900 extension.
The new tunnels permitted by the 1895 Act enabled the track layout at King William Street station to be modified to a single central platform with a track each side. This was opened as a temporary measure whilst funds for the extensions were raised. Finance was eventually obtained and construction proceeded so that the King William Street section closed and the first section of the northern extension opened on 25 February 1900, with stations at:
London Bridge station London Bridge
Bank and Monument stations Bank
Moorgate station Moorgate Street Moorgate from 1924

The southern extension opened shortly aftewards on 3 June 1900, with stations at:
Clapham North tube station Clapham Road Clapham North from 1926
Clapham Common tube station Clapham Common

Like the original Stockwell station and the rearranged King William Street station, Clapham Road and Clapham Common stations were constructed with a single station tunnel in which a central platform was served by tracks on each side.The C&SLR stations at Angel and Euston were also originally constructed with a single central platform. In both cases, later reconstruction means that the original station tunnel now serves trains in one direction only. Services in the other direction have been diverted into a new separate tunnel of their own.

Work continued on the rest of the northern extension. The City and South London Railway Act, 1900, approved on 25 May 1900,

Despite the technical innovations of the railway and the large passenger demand,Wolmar, Christian, p 140 the C&SLR was not particularly profitable and the rapid series of extensions undertaken by the company aimed at improving profits had placed a strain on the finances. The dividends were low and declining 2% in 1898, 1% in 1899 and 1% in 1900 Badsey-Ellis, Anthony, p. 95  and the company had been accused of extravagance for the abandonment of King William Street station. In an attempt to work around this poor reputation and make it easier to raise funds, the next bill for an extension of the line was submitted in November 1900 by a notionally separate company, the Islington and Euston Railway I&ER,

 albeit one that shared its chairman with the C&SLR.Charles Mott acted as Chairman for the C&SLR and the I&ER - Badsey-Ellis, Anthony, p. 96 The proposed railway was to run from the, as yet unfinished, C&SLR station at Angel to the mainline stations at London King's Cross railway station King's Cross, St Pancras railway station St. Pancras and Euston railway station Euston. The I&ER bill coincided with a rash of other railway bills encouraged by the successful opening of the Central Line Central London Railway CLR in 1900 and was considered alongside these by another parliamentary Joint Committee in 1901. The bill was approved,Badsey-Ellis, Anthony, p. 110  but the time taken for the committee's review meant that it had to be resubmitted for the 1902 parliamentary session. Badsey-Ellis, Anthony, p. 111 

In the 1902 session, the bill was considered again but was subject to opposition from one of London's other underground railways, the Metropolitan and Metropolitan District Railways#Metropolitan Railway Metropolitan Railway MR, which considered the proposed extension to be a threat to its service between King's Cross and Moorgate. The I&ER also submitted a petition to allow the C&SLR to take over the powers of the railway if approved.

 At Euston, the railway would have an interchange with the planned but not yet built Charing Cross, Euston & Hampstead Railway CCE&HR. The intention for C&BR powers was to adapt them to provide a new station at King William Street which would have pedestrian subway connections to the C&SLR's Bank station and the Metropolitan and Metropolitan District Railways#Metropolitan District Railway Metropolitan District Railway's MDR's Bank and Monument stations Monument station. A third pair of tunnels would be constructed under the Thames to connect with the original abandoned tunnels north of Borough station and then the C&BR route would be constructed as previously approved with connections to the existing C&SLR route at London Bridge and Oval. Badsey-Ellis, Anthony, pp. 212-213 This time, the bill was approved and received Royal assent as the City and South London Railway Act, 1903 on 11 August 1903.

 Although the C&BR proposals were never used, the Euston extension was quickly built and opened on 12 May 1907, with stations at:
King's Cross St. Pancras tube station King's Cross for St. Pancras King's Cross St. Pancras from 1933
Euston tube station Euston

Cooperation and consolidation, 1907 &ndash; 1919 
By 1907, Londoners had seen the network of deep tube underground railways expand from the original C&SLR line of 1890 with its six stations to a network of seven lines serving more than seventy stations.In order of opening, the seven lines were: 1. C&SLR 1890, 2. Waterloo & City Line Waterloo & City Railway 1898, 3. Central Line Central London Railway 1900, 4. Northern City Line Great Northern & City Railway 1904, 5. Bakerloo Line Baker Street & Waterloo Railway 1906, 6. Piccadilly Line Great Northern, Piccadilly & Brompton Railway 1906 and 7. Charing Cross, Euston & Hampstead Railway 1907. These companies, along with the sub-surface Metropolitan Railway and Metropolitan District Railway, criss-crossed beneath the city streets, competing with one another for passengers as well as with the new tram electric trams and bus motor buses. In a number of cases pre-opening predictions of passenger numbers had proven to be over optimistic. The reduced revenues generated from the lower numbers of passengers using the lines made it difficult for the operators to pay back the capital borrowed and pay dividends to shareholders.Wolmar, Christian, p 171 Badsey-Ellis, Anthony, pp. 282-283 

In an effort to improve their collective situations, the majority of the underground railways in London; the C&SLR, the CLR, the Northern City Line Great Northern & City Railway and the Underground Electric Railways Company Underground Electric Railways Company of London Limited UERL, which operated the Bakerloo Line Baker Street & Waterloo Railway BS&WR, the Piccadilly Line Great Northern, Piccadilly & Brompton Railway GNP&BR, the CCE&HR and the MDR began, from 1907, to introduce fare agreements. From 1908, they began to present themselves through common branding as the Underground. The Waterloo & City Line Waterloo & City Railway, which was operated by the mainline London and South Western Railway, was the only tube railway that did not participate in the arrangement.

In 1912, the C&SLR submitted another bill for parliamentary consideration seeking to increase its capacity by enlarging its tunnels to the larger diameter used for the tunnels of the more recently built railways. The enlarged tunnels would allow larger, more modern rolling stock to be used and this was also provided for in the bill.

 A separate bill was published at the same time by the Underground Electric Railways Company London Electric Railway LER, a company formed by the UERL in 1910 through a merger of the BS&WR, GNP&BR and CCE&HR which included plans to construct tunnels to connect the C&SLR at Euston to the CCE&HR's station at Camden Town tube station Camden Town.

 Together, the works proposed in these bills would enable the CCE&HR's trains to run over the C&SLR's route and vice versa, effectively combining the two separate railways. 

On 1 January 1913, the LER purchased the C&SLR, paying two shares of its own stock for three of the C&SLR'sWolmar, Christian, p 205 - a discount reflecting the struggling financial position of the older company.At the same time, the LER also bought the Central London Railway, swapping one of its shares for one of the Central's. Both bills were enacted on 15 August 1913 as the City and South London Railway Act, 1913 and the London Electric Railway Act, 1913.

 However; although the permissions to carry out the works had been renewed, the Underground companies were not in a position to raise the funds needed to pay for the works. Construction costs had increased considerably during the war years and the returns generated by the companies could not cover the cost of repaying borrowed capital.Wolmar, Christian, pp. 220-221

The projects were made possible when the government introduced the Trade Facilities Act, 1921 by which the HM Treasury Treasury underwriting underwrote loans for public works as a means of alleviating unemployment. With this support, the Underground companies were able to obtain the funds and work began on enlarging the tunnels of the C&SLR.

The tunnels were enlarged by removing a number of the cast iron segments from each tunnel ring, excavating a void behind to the required new diameter and reinstalling the segments with additional packing spacers. The northern section of the C&SLR between Euston and Moorgate was closed from 8 August 1922, but the rest of the line remained open with enlargement works taking place at night. A collapse on 27 November 1923 caused when a train hit temporary shoring on the incomplete excavations, filled the tunnel with soil. The line was briefly operated in two parts, but was completely closed on 28 November 1923.

The Euston to Moorgate section reopened on 20 April 1924, along with the new tunnels linking Euston to Camden Town. The rest of the line to Clapham Common reopened on 1 December 1924. At the same time as the tunnels were being enlarged, the stations were modernised, with longer platforms, a new tiling scheme on platform and passageway walls and new frontages to the surface buildings. A number of stations also received escalators to replace the original lifts.

Whilst the reconstruction works were underway, the C&SLR submitted a bill in 1922 which contained proposals to extend the line south from Clapham Common through Balham, London Balham and Tooting to Morden in tunnel.

 Parallel negotiations with the Southern Railway Great Britain Southern Railway over the proposals curtailed the extension at Morden where a large new depot was also constructed. The Morden extension opened on 13 September 1926, with stations designed by Charles Holden at:
Clapham South tube station Clapham South
Balham tube station Balham opened on 6 December 1926
Tooting Bec tube station Trinity Road Tooting Bec Tooting Bec from 1950
Tooting Broadway tube station Tooting Broadway
Colliers Wood tube station Colliers Wood
South Wimbledon tube station South Wimbledon
Morden tube station Morden

Also on 13 September 1926, a further connection between the CCE&HR and the C&SLR was opened when tunnels were brought into service from the CCE&HR's Embankment tube station Charing Cross station now Embankment to a Kennington station rebuilt with four platforms. An intermediate station was also constructed at Waterloo tube station Waterloo. Thus fully integrated, combined services operated over the C&SLR and CCE&HR routes using the newly built London Underground Standard Stock Standard Stock trains. On tube maps the combined lines were shown in a single colour although the separate names continued in use into the 1930s.The combined route was shown in black as it is today with the line names given as Hampstead and Highgate Line and City & South London Railway - for example, see http://homepage.ntlworld.com/clive.billson/tubemaps/1926-3rd.html 1926 tube map from http://homepage.ntlworld.com/clivebillson/tube/tube.html A History of the London Tube Maps.

Move to public ownership, 1924 &ndash; 1933
Despite the modernisation of the C&SLR and other improvements made to other parts of the network,During World War I, the BS&WR was extended from London Paddington station Paddington to Watford Junction railway station Watford Junction. Post war; extensions of the CLR from Wood Lane Central Line tube station Wood Lane to Ealing Broadway station Ealing Broadway 1920 and the CCE&HR from Golders Green tube station Golders Green to Edgware tube station Edgware 1923/1924 were opened. the Underground railways were still struggling to make a profit. The Underground Group's ownership of the highly profitable London General Omnibus Company LGOC since 1912 had enabled the Group, through the pooling of revenues, to use profits from the bus company to subsidise the less profitable railways.By having a virtual monopoly of bus services, the LGOC was able to generate large profits and pay dividends far higher than the underground railways ever had. In 1911, the year before its take over by the Underground Group, the dividend had been 18 per cent - Wolmar, Christian, p 204 However; competition from numerous small bus companies during the early years of the 1920s eroded the profitability of the LGOC and had a negative impact on the profitability of the whole Group. 

In an effort to protect the Group's income, its Managing Director/Chairman, Albert Stanley, 1st Baron Ashfield Lord Ashfield, lobbying lobbied the government for regulation of transport services in the London area. During the 1920s, a series of legislative initiatives were made in this direction, with Ashfield and Labour Party UK Labour London County Councillor later Member of Parliament#United Kingdom MP Herbert Morrison, at the forefront of debates as to the level of regulation and public control under which transport services should be brought. Ashfield aimed for regulation that would give the existing Group protection from competition and allow it to take substantive control of the LCC's tram system; Morrison preferred full public ownership.Wolmar, Christian, pp. 259-262 Eventually, after several years of false starts, a bill was announced at the end of 1930 for the formation of the London Passenger Transport Board, a public corporation which would take control of the Underground Group, the Metropolitan Railway as well as all buses and trams within an area designated as the London Passenger Transport Board#London Transport Passenger Area London Transport Passenger Area.

  The Board was a compromise - public ownership but not full nationalization nationalisation - and came into existence on 1 July 1933. From this date the C&SLR and the other Underground companies were liquidation liquidated.Wolmar, Christian, p266

Legacy
The technologies of deep tube tunnelling and electric traction pioneered and proved by the C&SLR shaped the direction of subsequent underground railways built in London.Badsey-Ellis, Anthony, p 47  The C&SLR demonstrated that an underground railway could be constructed without the need to purchase large and expensive tracts of land for the shallow cuttings of sub-surface steam operated railways. Instead, it became possible to construct a tunnel at deep level without adversely effecting conditions on the surface. The C&SLR thus encouraged the construction of a network of underground railways in London, - far larger than would have been the case otherwise.Wolmar, Christian, pp. 140-141

During World War II, the disused tunnels between Borough and King William Street stations were converted for use as air-raid shelters.Connor, J.E, pp. 10-13http://www.pendar.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/Tube/King_William_Street_2.html Abandoned Tube Stations - King William Street. Retrieved on 20 September 2007 In the 1960s they were used to assist the ventilation of London Bridge station.
