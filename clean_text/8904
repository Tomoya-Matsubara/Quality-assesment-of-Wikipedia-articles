 HMS Tudor was a British submarine of the third group of the T class. She was built as P326 at Devonport Dockyard, and launched on 23 September 1942. So far she has been the only ship of the Royal Navy to bear the name Tudor, after the Tudor period or Tudor dynasty.
Service
Tudor served in the Far East for much of her wartime career, where she sank five Japanese sailing vessels, four Japanese coasters, and another Japanese vessel, as well as an unidentified sailing vessel north of Sumatra.
She survived the war and continued in service with the Navy, finally being sold to be broken up for scrap on 1 July 1963 and scrapped at Faslane.1
