Third-person shooter (TPS) is a genre of 3D action games in which the player character is visible on-screen, and the gameplay consists primarily of shooting.
Definition
A &quot;third person shooter&quot; is a game structured around shooting,1 and in which the player can see the avatar on-screen (&quot;third person&quot;).23
Design
Third-person shooters are a type of 3D shooter game, which is a subgenre of action game that emphasizes the challenge of aiming and shooting. These games are distinguished from other shooter games because the graphical perspective is rendered from a fixed distance behind the player's avatar, and slightly above them. They tend to be more realistic than 2D shooters, not just graphically but in terms of gameplay. For example, games often limit the amount of ammunition that the avatar can carry, and damage is usually assessed based on what part of the body is hit by a gunshot. The 3D nature of these games also allows enemies to hide around corners or behind doors in a way that is not possible in a 2D game.4
Relationship to first-person shooters
These games are closely related to first-person shooters,5 which also tie to perspective of the player to an avatar,6 but the two genres are distinct.7 While the first-person perspective allows players to aim and shoot without their avatar blocking their view,8 the third-person shooter shows the protagonist from an &quot;over the shoulder&quot; or &quot;behind the back&quot; perspective.910 Thus, the third-person perspective allows the game designer to create a more strongly characterized avatar,11 and directs the player's attention as if watching a film. In contrast, a first-person perspective provides the player with greater immersion into the game universe.12
This difference in perspective also has an impact on gameplay. Third-person shooters allow players to see the area surrounding the avatar more clearly.13 This viewpoint facilitates more interaction between the character and their surrounding environment, such as the use of tactical cover in Gears of War,14 or navigating tight quarters.15 As such, the third-person perspective is more optimal for interacting with objects in the game world, such as jumping on platforms, engaging in close combat, or driving a vehicle. However, the third-person perspective can interfere with tasks that require fine aiming.16
Third person shooters sometimes compensate for their distinct perspective by designing larger, more spacious environments than first-person shooters.17
The boundaries between third-person and first-person shooters is not always clear. For example, many third-person shooters allow the player to use a first-person viewpoint for challenges that require precise aiming.18 The first-person shooter Halo: Combat Evolved was actually designed as a third-person shooter, but added a first-person perspective to improve the interface for aiming and shooting.19 The game switches to a third-person viewpoint when the avatar is piloting a vehicle,20 and this combination of first-person for aiming and third-person for driving has since been used in other games.21 Metroid Prime is another first-person shooter that switches to a third-person perspective when rolling around the environment using the morph ball.22
History
Tomb Raider has been credited as the game that popularized the subgenre.23 The game eschewed the popular first person perspective of games such as Doom, instead making use of &quot;third person&quot; viewpoints, wide 3D environments and a control system inspired by Prince of Persia.24 Syphon Filter, which has been deemed the most popular third person shooter for the PlayStation,25 combined the perspective of Tomb Raider with action elements of games such as GoldenEye 007 and Metal Gear Solid.26 While in Tomb Raider and Syphon Filter the protagonists automatically aimed at antagonists,2728 later games such as Max Payne and SOCOM forced players to control aiming themselves by means of two control sticks or a keyboard and mouse.29 Max Payne (2002) was acclaimed as a superlative third person shooter, inspired by Hong Kong action cinema.30 The acclaimed Gears of War employed tactical elements such as taking cover,31 using off-centre viewpoints inspired by Resident Evil 4.32 The game also employed grittier themes than other titles and used a unique feature which rewarded the player for correctly reloading weapons.33 Gears of War, as well as games such as Army of Two and the upcoming Quantum Theory place a greater emphasis on two player cooperative play.3435 Upcoming game Damnation, set to be published by CodeMasters, experiments with exceedingly tall levels and acrobatic gameplay.36 As of 2009, the genre has a large audience outside of Japan, particularly in North America.37
Influence on popular culture
Alexander R. Galloway writes that the &quot;real-time, over-the-shoulder tracking shots of Gus Van Sant's Elephant evoke third-person shooter games like Max Payne, a close cousin of the FPS.&quot;38
