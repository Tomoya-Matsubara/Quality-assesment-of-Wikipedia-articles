Dr. Ismet Popovac was a Bosnian Muslim military commander, politician, physician, and lawyer who led a Muslim Chetnik militia known as the Muslim People's Military Organization (, MNVO) in Bosnia and Herzegovina during World War II. A former mayor of the Bosnian town of Konjic, he joined the Chetnik movement of Dra&lt;U+017E&gt;a Mihailovi&lt;U+0107&gt; after the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in 1941. As a proponent of Bosnian Muslim collaboration with the Chetniks, Popovac suggested that the Chetniks recruit Muslims into their ranks. In October 1942, he enlisted Italian aid in fighting the Yugoslav Partisans, and later visited Prozor to discourage further bloodshed after a Chetnik massacre took the lives of 543&lt;U+2013&gt;2,500 Muslim and Croat civilians. In early 1943 he led an attack against a Muslim village, before being killed by either the Partisans, Chetniks, or an assassin in the vicinity of the town of Trebinje later that year.
Biography
Early life
From the Herzegovinian town of Nevesinje, Ismet Popovac was a physician and lawyer by profession. He finished medical school in Belgrade and was a vocal supporter of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia during this time. Prior to the outbreak of World War II, he was the mayor of the Bosnian town of Konjic and was allegedly a candidate for Vladko Ma&lt;U+010D&gt;ek's electoral list, but was left without a job in the state government after the creation of the Banovina of Croatia.
Joining the Chetniks
On 6 April 1941, Axis forces invaded Yugoslavia. Poorly equipped and poorly trained, the Royal Yugoslav Army was quickly defeated. The country was then dismembered, and Bosnia and Herzegovina became part of the newly formed Independent State of Croatia (, NDH). That year, Popovac and fellow Muslim leader Mustafa Pa&lt;U+0161&gt;i&lt;U+0107&gt; joined the Chetnik movement of Dra&lt;U+017E&gt;a Mihailovi&lt;U+0107&gt;. Popovac hoped to achieve independence for Bosnia and Herzegovina through his cooperation and, according to one Serb Chetnik, his &quot;main goal was to protect the Muslims, rather than to struggle for the Serb nation and Serb affairs.&quot; He later wrote to Mihailovi&lt;U+0107&gt;, suggesting that Bosnian Muslims be recruited into the Chetnik ranks. This proposal was met with support from pro-Serb, anti-Communist Muslim leaders in several Bosnian towns. However, due to mass atrocities carried out by the Chetniks against non-Serbs in the late spring of 1941, and due to Muslims, especially those in eastern Bosnia, being branded by the Chetniks as &quot;Turks&quot; and &quot;Usta&lt;U+0161&gt;e cronies,&quot; few Muslim recruits were found.
Muslim People's Military Organization
 In late 1942, a Muslim Chetnik militia known as the Muslim People's Military Organization (, MNVO) was formed in Herzegovina. It was placed under the control of Popovac, Fekim Musakadi&lt;U+0107&gt; and Mustafa Pa&lt;U+0161&gt;i&lt;U+0107&gt;. Popovac's MNVO were part of a greater Muslim autonomist circle and in September 1942 an assembly of Herzegovinian Muslim notables in Mostar declared: &quot;We Herzegovinians and Bosnians are nobody's property and we recognize the right of nobody to persecute us; so, insofar as our brothers in Zagreb do not wish to accede to our demands, we shall seek protection of our interests from other big powers from the ranks of our allies.&quot; In October of that year, Popovac enlisted Italian aid in fighting the Yugoslav Partisans. This resulted in the establishment of a Bosnian Muslim quisling force that operated as part of the Anti-Communist Volunteer Militia. It was reported that he had &quot;won the majority of the Muslims to his purpose&quot; in the Mostar, Konjic, Nevesinje and Gacko districts. Eventually, he came to be seen as one of &quot;the principal representatives of the pro-Chetnik Muslim current&quot; in Bosnia.
That October, during Operation Alfa, a joint Chetnik&lt;U+2013&gt;Italian attack against the Partisans, the Chetniks massacred 543&lt;U+2013&gt;2,500 Muslim and Croat civilians in Prozor. Several days later, Popovac arrived in the town to console the Bosnian Muslim population and to advise the Chetniks there against committing further atrocities. While there, he also attempted to convince local Muslims to join the Chetnik ranks, but was unsuccessful due to the extent of Chetnik atrocities against the Muslim population. On 31 December, in face of widespread Muslim opposition to the Chetniks' genocidal nature, Popovac and his MNVO declared a resolution in Kalinovik, vowing allegiance to King Petar II and Mihailovi&lt;U+0107&gt;, and claiming Muslims as &quot;an integral part of Serbdom&quot; and the MNVO as &quot;part of the Chetnik movement led by Dra&lt;U+017E&gt;a Mihailovi&lt;U+0107&gt;, Minister of the Army, Navy and Air Forces.&quot;
In January 1943, Popovac led an attack which resulted in the capture of a Muslim village that was guarded by a large force of Muslim volunteers. That same month more Chetnik massacres against Muslims were carried out, especially in east Bosnia in the areas of Koraj, Bijeljina, Srebrenica, Vi&lt;U+0161&gt;egrad, Fo&lt;U+010D&gt;a, Gora&lt;U+017E&gt;de, Vlasenica, and around the Drina river. His militia cooperated with Chetnik units in fighting the Partisans during the Axis-led Case White operation in January to March 1943, but did not distinguish itself. During the operation itself Chetniks continued their efforts to exterminate the Muslims. Nonetheless, Popovac and Pa&lt;U+0161&gt;i&lt;U+0107&gt; continued seeking Muslim recruits. They declared in their &quot;Address to the Brethren Muslims of &lt;U+010C&gt;ajni&lt;U+010D&gt;e and Other Nearby Districts&quot; that the main goal of the Chetniks was &quot;the intelligent and honest protection of Muslim interests&quot; and &quot;securing a safe future for our people with the highest principles of Islam: freedom of religion, holiness of the family, respect for private property, social justice, and democratic political freedom.&quot; Furthermore, they dismissed the claim that Muslims were collectively responsible for Usta&lt;U+0161&gt;e crimes and said &quot;Muslims are bound to the brethren of the Orthodox religion by blood and land.&quot;
Death
Popovac was killed on 21 August 1943. Sources vary on the circumstances of his death, with Dr. Noel Malcolm stating that he was captured by the Partisans and shot, Professor Jozo Tomasevich writing that he was &quot;killed by an assassin,&quot; and Zdravko Dizdar and Mihael Sobolevski claiming that he was killed by the Chetniks in the vicinity of Trebinje after objecting to the killing of Muslims.
Legacy
By December 1943, it was estimated that 4,000 of Mihailovi&lt;U+0107&gt;'s Chetniks were Bosnian Muslims. This number accounted for eight percent of all of Mihailovi&lt;U+0107&gt;'s soldiers. In 1944, Mihailovi&lt;U+0107&gt; appealed to the Muslims to fight against the Communists, citing the example of Popovac and other Muslim Chetniks.
