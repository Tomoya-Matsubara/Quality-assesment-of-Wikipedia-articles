ROKS Cheonan PCC-772 was a South Korean Pohang class corvette Pohang-class corvette of the Republic of Korea Navy ROKN, commissioned in 1989. On 26&nbsp;March 2010, it broke in two and sank near the sea border with North Korea. An investigation conducted by an international team of experts from South Korea, United States, United Kingdom, Australia, and Sweden concluded that Cheonan was sunk by a torpedo launched by a North Korean Yono class submarine Yeono class miniature submarine.cite news  url=http://koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2010/04/205_64242.html   title=External Impact Likely Cause of Ship Sinking  work=The Korea Times   date=15 April 2010 accessdate=16 April 2010http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Asia-Pacific/2010/0520/North-Korea-rebuffs-South-Korea-s-evidence-on-Cheonan-attack/page/2 North Korea rebuffs South Korea's evidence on Cheonan attack,  Christian Science Monitor, May 20, 2010.

On 3 April 2010, South Korean officials said that a private fishing boat involved in the rescue operations had collided with a Cambodian freighter, sinking the fishing boat and killing at least two people, with seven reported missing. The same day, the Joint Chiefs of Staff of South Korea said that one body of the 46 missing sailors had been found.cite news  url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8601540.stm title=Nine missing as S Korean boat sinks in warship search  work=BBC News Online date=3 April 2010 accessdate=3 April 2010

Later on 3 April 2010 South Korea called off the rescue operation for the missing sailors, after families of the sailors asked for the operation to be suspended for fear of further casualties among the rescue divers. The military's focus then shifted towards salvage operations, which were predicted to take up to a month to complete.cite news url= http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jQydsIWmNQZpwRriADac51u5rx8gD9ERMARG1 title=SKorea stops underwater search for missing sailors author=Kwang-Tae Kim date=3 April 2010  work=The Associated Press accessdate=2010-04-03

Main ROKS Cheonan sinking#Investigation
On 25 April 2010, South Korea's defense minister, Kim Tae-Young R.O.K. Army general Kim Tae-Young, said that the most likely cause of the explosion that sank the Cheonan was a torpedo; his statements were the first time that a South Korean official publicly cited such a cause. Kim said that A Naval_mine#Bubble_jet_effect bubble jet caused by a heavy torpedo is thought to be the most likely thing to be blamed, but various other possibilities are also under review. A bubble jet is caused by an underwater explosion which changes the pressure of water, and whose force can cause a ship to break apart. The bubble jet theory was supported by one of the investigators into the incident, who had said that there was no evidence that an explosion had occurred in contact with a ship, and that a non-contact explosion had most likely broken the ship in half.cite news  url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/26/world/asia/26korea.html title=South Korea Cites Torpedo Attack in Ship Sinking  work=The New York Times date=25 April 2010 accessdate=25 April 2010   first=Choe   last=Sang-Hun

On 20 May 2010, an international commission investigating the sinking of Cheonan presented its findings, and said that the ship was sunk by a North Korean torpedo attack.cite news  url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/asia_pacific/10129703.stm title='North Korean torpedo' sank South's navy ship - report  work=BBC News  date=20 May 2010 accessdate=20 May 2010cite news  url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/nol/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/20_05_10jigreport.pdf title=Investigation Result on the Sinking of ROKS Cheonan by The Joint Civilian-Military Investigation Group date=20 May 2010 accessdate=28 November 2010
The torpedo parts recovered at the site of the explosion by a dredging ship on May 15, which include 5x5 bladed contra-rotating propellers, propulsion motor and a steering section, were claimed to perfectly match the schematics of the CHT-02D torpedo included in introductory brochures provided to foreign countries by North Korea for export purposes, but the brochures were never made public. The markings in Hangul, which read 1 or No. 1 in English, found inside the end of the propulsion section were said to have been consistent with markings on a previously obtained North Korean torpedo.  However, some have pointed out that in the North, pronounced ho is most often used rather than ; and that a North Korean torpedo found seven years ago bears the marking 4.cite news  url=http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_national/421856.html title=Questions Raised Following Cheonan Announcement  work=The Hankyoreh 21 May 2010 accessdate=28 November 2010 Russian and Chinese torpedoes are marked in their respective languages. The CHT-02D torpedo manufactured by North Korea utilizes  acoustic/wake homing and passive acoustic tracking methods.cite news  url=http://www.mnd.go.kr/mndEng_2009/WhatsNew/RecentNews/index.jsp title=Investigation Result on the Sinking of ROKS Cheonan - report publisher=Ministry of National Defense R.O.K. accessdate=20 May 2010 However, an expert at a South Korean missile manufacturer disagreed with the idea that the submarine alleged by ROK authorities to have shot the torpedo actually has the capability: Sango class submarines are known to be used by North Korean commandos in infiltrating areas or laying mines, but they apparently do not have an advanced system to guide homing weapons. If a smaller class submarine was involved, there is a bigger question mark.cite news  url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2010/05/205_66234.html title=Questions Raised About 'Smoking Gun' work=The Korea Times 20 May 2010 accessdate=28 November 2010

One member of the investigative team, Shin Sang-cheol, who would be summoned on charges of spreading unsubstantiated rumors, publicly expressed doubts by saying The magnified photo of the evidence showed that the marking was written on the rusted surface.  If it were the North who marked it, the marking should have been written on a smooth surface.cite news  url=http://joongangdaily.joins.com/article/view.asp?aid=2921120 title=Probe member summoned on false rumor allegations work=JoonAng Daily date=29 May 2010 accessdate=28 November 2010 The Ministry of Defense had earlier tried to remove Shin from the investigative team, saying that He is not qualified to work as part of the investigation team, as he has been spreading malicious rumors, as well as lacks expertise and has been insincere in his participation in the probe.cite news  url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2010/10/116_65828.html title=Gov't seeks to replace Cheonan investigator  work=The Korea Times  date=13 May 2010 accessdate=28 November 2010

On 13 September 2010, the final report was issued by JIG which concluded that, The Cheonan was split and sunk due to a shockwave and bubble effect generated by the underwater explosion of a torpedo. The detonation location was three meters to port from the center of the gas turbine room and at a depth of 6-9 meters...  Their conclusion was that the torpedo did not physically hit the ship, but the explosion was close enough and destructive enough to sink it.cite news  url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2010/09/205_72997.html title=Seoul reaffirms North Koreas torpedo attack in final report publisher=Korea Times date=13 September 2010 accessdate=13 Sep 2010
