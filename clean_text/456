The Millennium Stadium () is the national stadium of Wales, located in the capital Cardiff. It is the home of the Wales national rugby union team and the Wales national football team but is also host to many other events and sports, such as Wales Rally Great Britain stage of the World Rally Championship, Speedway Grand Prix of Great Britain, boxing and many music concerts, including Madonna, The Rolling Stones and Tsunami Relief concert.
The stadium opened in June 1999,1 with the first major event being held on 26 June 1999, when Wales beat South Africa in a rugby friendly match by 29-19, before a test crowd of 29,000.2 It is the largest stadium in the world with a fully retractable roof and was only the second stadium in Europe to have this facility.34 At the time of its construction it was the largest stadium in the United Kingdom with a capacity of 74,500,5 but has since been overtaken by Twickenham Stadium and the new Wembley Stadium. It is the fourth largest stadium in the Six Nations Championship behind Twickenham, Stade de France and Croke Park, which is the largest.
The Millennium Stadium is owned by Millennium Stadium plc which is a subsidiary company of the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU).6 The total construction cost of the stadium was GB&lt;U+00A3&gt;121 million,7 of which the Millennium Commission funded GB&lt;U+00A3&gt;46m.8
History
Background
Until 1969, Cardiff RFC and Wales both played their home matches on the same pitch, but all this would change in the 1969-70 season.9 As a result of an agreement between Cardiff Athletic Club and the WRU, the National Stadium project had established that a new stadium for international matches was required, with Cardiff rugby fixtures switching to the original cricket ground on the Cardiff Arms Park site.10 By 7 AprilÂ 1984 the National Stadium was officially opened. However in 1994, a redevelopment committee was set up to consider redeveloping the National Stadium, and by 1995 the WRU had been chosen to host the 1999 Rugby World Cup.11

The National Stadium

In 1995, the National Stadium, which was designed in 1962,12 only had a capacity of 53,000, other nations stadia, such as Twickenham (England) with a capacity of 82,000 and Murrayfield Stadium (Scotland) with a capacity of 67,000 had overtaken it. France was also about to build the Stade de France, which would have a capacity of over 80,000 for the 1998 FIFA World Cup.13 The original capacity of the National Stadium was 65,000, but this had been reduced to 53,000, for safety reasons. 11,000 of 53,000 capacity was on the East Terrace and the conversion to an all-seater stadium would have reduced the stadium capacity still further to just 47,500.14
In addition to the problems of capacity, the National Stadium was also very well hidden by the neighbouring buildings to the south in Park Street, Wood Street and to the east in Westgate Street, and also by Cardiff Rugby Ground in the north. It was only fully visible from across the River Taff in the west. Access to the ground was also very restricted with the main entrance being a narrow opening in Westgate Street to the east which was shared by both vehicles and spectators alike.15
The options for the new stadium included; adding a third tier to the existing National Stadium or moving to a new site. This last option was discounted because it would have required a vast car parking facility and that would have put severe short-term pressures on the local transport infrastructure, creating traffic jams and pollution.16 The committee eventually chose a new stadium on the same site but with considerable increase in its capacity. It would also involve moving the alignment of the stadium from west-east to north-south. This was the option supported by the Millennium Commission. It would become the fourth redevelopment of the Cardiff Arms Park site.17 It was also decided that the new stadium should have a sliding roof to accommodate a multi-use venue, with a grass pitch for rugby and football (soccer).18 The only other sliding roof in Europe at the time was at the Amsterdam Arena, with a capacity of 50,000.19
In order to remain on the Arms Park site, additional space had to be found to allow safe access and to provide room for the increased capacity and improved facilities. This was achieved by the purchase of adjacent buildings to the south and east and by the construction of a new River Walk by the River Taff on the west side of the stadium.
By 1999 the Millennium Stadium had replaced the National Stadium, Cardiff Arms Park, as the national stadium of Wales for rugby union and association football international matches. Cardiff RFC continued as before to play at Cardiff Arms Park rugby ground, which had replaced the cricket ground in 1969.2021
Construction

Construction involved the demolish of a number of buildings, primarily the existing National Stadium (Cardiff Arms Park), Wales Empire Pool in Wood Street, Cardiff Empire Telephone Exchange building (owned by BT) in Park Street, the newly built Territorial Auxiliary &amp; Volunteer Reserve building, also in Park Street and the Social Security offices in Westgate Street.2223
The stadium was built by John Laing plc, the head of construction was Steve Ager,24 in 1999 on the site of the National Stadium. It was built for the 1999 Rugby World Cup, for which Wales was the main host.25 It was home to seven of the 41 matches, including the final.
The total construction cost of the stadium was &lt;U+00A3&gt;121 million,26 which was funded by private investment and GB&lt;U+00A3&gt;46 million of public funds from the Millennium Commission,27 the sale of debentures to supporters (which offered guaranteed tickets in exchange for an interest-free loan), and loans. The development left the WRU heavily in debt.
The Millennium Stadium was first used for a major event on 26 June 1999, when Wales played South Africa in a rugby union friendly match before a test crowd of 29,000. Wales won the match 29-19: the first time they had ever beaten the Springboks.28
Features
The all-seater stadium has the capacity for 74,500 supporters and features a retractable roof,29 only the second stadium in Europe, and the largest stadium by capacity in the world, with this feature to protect the playing surface from the elements.30 Additional seating is sometimes added for special events such as a rugby Test against the All Blacks, or formerly for the FA Cup Final. The current record attendance is 75,100, recorded at Wales' 30&lt;U+2013&gt;15 victory over Scotland in the 2008 Six Nations Championship on 9 February 2008.31
The natural grass turf is a made up of a modular system installed by GreenTech ITM.32 It features built in irrigation and drainage. The pitch itself is laid on top of some 7,412 pallets which can be moved so the stadium can be used for concerts, exhibitions and other events.3334

South Stand with the previous name of the stand &quot;Hyder&quot;, blanked out with white seats

The four ends of the ground are called; the North Stand, the West Stand, the South Stand and the BT Stand (east).35 The South Stand was previously known as the Hyder Stand,36 until Hyder plc was sold. The stadium has 3 tiers of seating with the exception of the North Stand, which has 2 tiers. The lower tier holds approximately 23,500 spectators, the middle tier holding 18,000 and the upper tier holding 33,000 spectators.37
The stadium was slightly restricted in size due to its proximity to Cardiff Rugby Club's home in the adjacent smaller stadium within Cardiff Arms Park. The WRU were unable to secure enough funding to include the North Stand in the new stadium, and the Millennium Commission would not allow any of its funds to be used in any way for the construction of a new stadium for Cardiff RFC.38 The WRU held talks with CRFC Ltd to see if it would be possible for the club to either move or secure funding for the Cardiff Arms Park to be re-developed, but these were unsuccessful. The stadium thus had to be completed with a break in its bowl structure in the North Stand, known colloquially as Glanmor's Gap, after Glanmor Griffiths, then chairman of the WRU and now a former president.39

Glanmor's Gap, North Stand

The superstructure of the stadium is based around four  masts. The stadium was built from 56,000 tonnes of concrete and steel, and has 128 hospitality boxes,40 22 bars, 7 restaurants, 17 first aid points, 12 escalators and 7 lifts.41 The stadium has 7 gates for access to the site; Gate 1 is from the River Walk via Castle Street (to the north), Gates 2 and 3 are via Westgate Street (to the east), Gate 4 is for Security only also via Westgate Street, Gate 5 is via Park Street (to the south) and Gates 6 and 7 are via the Millennium Plaza (also to the south).42
Cardiff RFC Ltd reached a Heads of Terms agreement with Cardiff City Football Club and Cardiff County Council to move the Cardiff Blues to the new Cardiff City stadium at the start of the 2009-10 season. Despite the revelation that the South Stand of Cardiff Arms Park and therefore the adjoining North Stand of the Millennium Stadium has concrete cancer, the old structure has an expected working life until 2020. However, it is acknowledged that major rebuilding work will be required at this end of the Millennium Stadium within the next 30 years. This opens the door to the possibility of the stadium expanding by taking over the site of Cardiff RFC, who will be forced to vacate due to the demolition work, if they haven't done so already. 43
In each of the stadium's bars, so-called &quot;joy machines&quot; can pour 12 pints in less than 20 seconds. During a Wales Vs France match, 63,000 fans drank 77,184 pints of beer, almost double the 44,000 pints drunk by a similar number of fans at a game at Twickenham.44 The stadium has a resident hawk named &quot;Dad&quot;, who is employed to drive seagulls and pigeons out of the stadium.45

Usage
As well as international rugby union and association football, the Millennium Stadium has hosted a variety of sports, including, rugby league (including the Challenge Cup final on 3 occasions between 2003 and 2005, and Welsh Rugby League internationals), speedway, indoor cricket, boxing, the Wales Rally Great Britain stage of the World Rally Championship, and recently, Monster Jam trucks Europe tour.
Rugby union

The pre-match entertainment before the Wales and Scotland match in the 2008 Six Nations Championship

The stadium is the home of the Welsh rugby union team, who play all of their home fixtures at the venue. These games include those during the Six Nations, as well as the November Tests against nations from the Southern Hemisphere. Apart from the national team the stadium has been used for Celtic League games, as well as Heineken Cup matches.
The stadium has hosted the semi-finals of the Anglo-Welsh Cup in 2006 and 2007, as well as Heineken Cup finals in:
2001-02 Leicester Tigers 15 - 9 Munster46
2005-06 Munster 23 - 19 Biarritz 47
2007-08 Toulouse 13 - 16 Munster48
The stadium also staged 3 pool matches and 1 quarter-final match ( New Zealand 18-20 France ) of the 2007 Rugby World Cup.49505152
Rugby league
The Millennium Stadium has hosted 3 of rugby league's Challenge Cup Finals, one of the biggest annual showpiece events the UK's sporting calendar.
Also, in 2007 the stadium hosted the inaugural Millennium Magic weekend. This was a 2-day event in May when an entire round of Super League matches were played, 3 games on the Saturday and 3 games on the Sunday. The event was deemed a success by the sport's governing body, the RFL, and 2nd Millennium Magic event took place in May 2008, although the 2009 event has now has been moved to Murrayfield Stadium.
Association football

The 2007 Football League Cup Final between Chelsea and Arsenal

Since 2000, the stadium has also been the almost-permanent home of Welsh football. The national team play the vast majority of home matches at the Millennium Stadium, with a handful of friendly matches once or twice a year at the Racecourse Ground, Wrexham or Liberty Stadium, Swansea.535455 The first Welsh football game at the stadium was held in 2000 was against Finland,56 and drew a then record home crowd for Welsh football of over 66,000.57 This has since been beaten on several occasions.
It is likely that the stadium would also be the venue of the final match of a proposed UEFA Euro 2016 championship hosted jointly by Wales and Scotland.58
Wembley construction

The 125th FA Cup Final in 2006 between Liverpool and West Ham

Whilst the Millennium Stadium was under construction, the original 1923 Wembley Stadium had hosted the Welsh rugby team during the building of the new ground. The favour was returned from 2001 whilst England's national stadium, Wembley Stadium was undergoing rebuilding, with the Millennium hosting:

FA Cup Final
League Cup Final
Football League Trophy Final
Football League play-off Finals
FA Community Shield
Rugby League Challenge Cup

The stadium became notorious for an apparent &quot;away team hoodoo&quot;.59 The first twelve major cup finals were all won by the teams occupying the home dressing room with their fans in the North Stand. Stoke City beat Brentford 2-0 in 2002 to end the &quot;hoodoo&quot;, but only after an expert in the fine art of feng shui, Paul Darby had carried out a blessing. This may have been little more than a publicity stunt.6061
Liverpool were the first team to win the FA Cup at the Millennium Stadium in 2001 after beating Arsenal 2-1.62 Fittingly they also won the last FA Cup to be held at the Millennium Stadium in 2006, after beating West Ham United 3-1 in a penalty shootout that followed a 3-3 draw after extra time in a final that was billed as 'the best cup final of the modern era'.63
The Nationwide Division 3, now Coca Cola League 2, play-offs in 2003 saw AFC Bournemouth beat Lincoln City FC 5 goals to 2. In this game AFC Bournemouth set the record of 5 goals scored by one team in a single match at the Millenium Stadium. This record has been matched but not beaten since.64
The last domestic cup match played was when Doncaster Rovers beat Bristol Rovers 3-2 AET in the Johnstone's Paint Trophy Final on April 1, 2007.65
Motorsports

Wales Rally Great Britain 2006

In 2001 it staged its first ever motorsport event, hosting the Speedway Grand Prix of Great Britain, and has done every year since, in 2007 attracting a record crowd of 41,247, a record for British Speedway.66 In September 2005 the stadium was host to the first ever indoor stage of the World Rally Championship during the Wales Rally Great Britain. The lower tier of the stadium was removed to create a figure-of-eight course.67 In addition to this, the stadium has also hosted Supercross events.68 In October 2007, the stadium first hosted the UK leg of the Monster Jam trucks Europe tour, and returned again in June 200869
Film
The stadium has also on occasion been used as a venue for shooting film and television productions. &quot;Dalek&quot;,70 an episode of the 2005 season of the BBC science fiction television series Doctor Who, was shot primarily on location at the stadium, using its underground areas to stand in for an underground base in Utah, United States in the year 2012. The location shooting for the episode took place during October and November 2004. The underground areas of the stadium were used again in Doctor Who for the 2005 Christmas special, &quot;The Christmas Invasion&quot;.71 The area was used as the headquarters for UNIT,72 based under the Tower of London. The episode was broadcast on Christmas Day 2005. The Hindi film Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gham was also filmed there.73
The Wembley Stadium scene in the film 28 Weeks Later was actually filmed at the Millennium Stadium. Although the outside is footage of Wembley, the inside is all filmed in Cardiff. The effects team on the film edited the footage to make it look more like Wembley.74
London 2012 Olympics
For the 2012 Summer Olympics, the stadium will also be one of the hosts for the football events hosting at least eight football matches.75
Other

Eric Clapton at the Tsunami Relief Concert

The stadium has also been used for a variety of musical events, the most famous being the Manic Street Preachers concert held on Millennium Eve,76 and, on the following day, a recording of the BBC's Songs of Praise, which attracted an attendance of 60,000. 77 Tina Turner performed a sold-out concert at the stadium during her highly successful Twenty Four Seven Tour in 2000.78 At the end of January 2005, the stadium hosted a tsunami relief concert in aid of the victims of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, with Eric Clapton headlining the event.79 The stadium has also been host to Madonna on two occasions, the first in July 2006 when she opened the UK leg of her Confessions Tour,80 and most recently in August 2008 when she kicked off her Sticky &amp; Sweet Tour at the stadium.81 Other performers who have played at the stadium are Robbie Williams,82 U2,83 Red Hot Chili Peppers,84 The Rolling Stones,85 Bon Jovi,86 R.E.M.,87 and The Police.88 As well, in late 2005 the stadium welcomed rock band  Oasis for a sold-out night during the Don't Believe the Truth Tour.89 In 2008 the stadium hosted Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band as part of their 2008 summer tour promoting Springsteen's 23rd album Magic,90 along with Neil Diamond.91
