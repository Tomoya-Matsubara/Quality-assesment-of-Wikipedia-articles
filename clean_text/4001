Jack Steinberger (born May 25, 1921) is a physicist. He co-discovered the muon neutrino. He won a Nobel Prize in Physics in 1988.
Steinberger was born in the city of Bad Kissingen in Bavaria, Germany, but left at the age of 13, due to the increasing anti-Semitism of the rising Nazi party. He moved to the United States, where he lived for many years, before moving to Switzerland to work at CERN.
