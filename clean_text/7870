The avante garde Alien&lt;U+00B3&gt; score was written for the motion picture of the same name, scored by Elliot Goldenthal, it was his first big mainstream score; he described it as an experiment and spent a whole year creating it.1
Goldenthal's work for Alien&lt;U+00B3&gt; is widely considered one of his most intensely inventive, visceral, influential works and indeed, by many listeners, to be his best;2 Goldenthal himself cites the score as one of his stand-out soundtracks.3
Even though the score is generally considered a magnum opus it is also considered to be the case that most of the cues are quite &quot;dissonant&quot; and &quot;bleak&quot; for a casual movie score listener and, more, one for the aficionado.45

Audio

The atmospheric, menacing cue that comes with the opening sequence of the Sulaco being evacuated by the on-board computer because of the alien presence and fire. This sample is taken from the part where the escape pod is hurtling through the planets atmosphere.  Cue of the failed attempt to capture the alien; in the track we hear his epic use of horns, it shows his unique time signitures.  Cue from the scene where the sprinkler system is activated to destroy the alien, here Goldenthals complex string arangements are exemplified strongly.  The cue from the scene where Ripley commits suicide in the blast furnace, here Goldenthals epic, anthemic crescendo makes it one of the stand out tracks on the score.
