Background
&quot;Forever Is Over&quot; was revealed as the title for the group's second album's lead single on July 25. A sixty-second preview of track was premiered on August 22 with the full song premiering on radio the following day.1
&quot;Forever Is Over&quot; was originally written for former American Idol winner Kelly Clarkson by former Busted star James Bourne, who is well known for his writing for the likes of Jordin Sparks' single &quot;Battlefield&quot;. Group member Mollie King explained to the Daily Star how the group came to record it instead:  The song was also wanted by American pop rock artist P!nk.2 The track was co-written and produced by Louis Biancaniello and Sam Watters, famed for their writing of Keri Hilson' single &quot;Energy&quot; and work with Jordin Sparks.
Una Healy opens the song and sings the first verse and the song's bridge. Rochelle Wiseman sings the calls in the second verse and the third verse. Mollie King sings three responses in the second verse. Vanessa White sings one response in the second verse, the chorus' solos vocals, backing vocals during third verse, the four responses in the fourth verse, and the end of the song. Frankie Sandford sings the calls in the fourth verse and backing vocals during the second and third chorus.
The single was accompanied by a B-side entitled &quot;I Can't Wait&quot; which was co-written by The Saturdays together with Hannah Robinson and producers Ben Macklin, Julian Peake and Richard Stannard.3 David Balls of entertainment website Digital Spy said of the b-side &quot;Another decent B-side from the girls [...] A laid-back electro poppy offering that recalls the more subdued moments from their debut album.&quot;4
Critical reception
The song received positive reviews from music critics: Nick Levine from Digital Spy said &quot;'Forever Is Over' finds them shifting away from glossy electropop and taking a few stiletto steps into pop rock territory,&quot; and further describing the song as having a &quot;Big, beltalong chorus that hits its target, and that Una Healy shines on the guitary middle 8.&quot;5 The BBC Chart Blog elaborated on the single as being in the &quot;Highest realms of the UK pop league up there with the Pixie Lotts and Girls Alouds of the world,&quot; further describing it as sounding &quot;Slick&quot; and &quot;Big&quot; with a &quot;Mahoosive, dancealong, brilliant chorus.&quot;6 Musosguide reviewed &quot;Forever Is Over&quot; as a &quot;Deliciously catchy tune that marks a welcome return to the electric guitar to a pop market that is saturated beyond recognition with electro-sounds.&quot;7 OK! Magazine labelled the song as &quot;An infectious synth pop tune&quot;.8 TeenToday.co.uk mentioned the track as having &quot;A killer soar of a chorus, which Vanessa is all over like a gorgeously-voiced rash&quot; and as &quot;Radio-friendly as pop can get.&quot;9 Muumuse.com had the following to say: &quot;Radio-friendly doesn't even begin to describe it - the chorus is simply massive.&quot;10 TheChemistryIsDead.com described &quot;Forever Is Over&quot; as &quot;Rockier than their other stuff but it's very sleek and polished.&quot;11 WessexScene.co.uk reviewed the single as &quot;A sophisticated more pop rock breakaway from the girls' previous pure pop style and has a more transatlantic feel to it&quot; further saying that &quot;It is vocally impressive. Una's attitudey solo stands out as well as Vanessa's impressive warbling throughout the chorus.&quot;12 Entertainment-focus.com reviewed the lead single as &quot;A slow-building pop stormer and that all five girls sharing vocals adds a harder edge to their normally polished pop sound.&quot;13 Whilst Yahoo! Music's view of track included it having &quot;Sultry verses and a full throttle chorus which suggests a new, more sophisticated direction to put them on par with their rivals.&quot;14

Music Video
 &quot;Forever Is Over&quot; was accompanied by a music video for its single release. The music video was shot on July 29, 2009.17 The music video was directed by Trudy Bellinger.
The music video takes on an urban theme to it and sees the girls in a house and around a city singing. The video involves no dance routines and ends with the girls leaving a nightclub. During Una Healy's middle eight of the song the girls can be seen bathed in atmospheric blue lighting whilst wearing black outfits. Other scenes include Mollie King licking her thumb and smearing her heart-shaped tattoo saying 'Forever' as a metaphor for saying that &quot;Forever Is Over&quot;. In another seen Una can be seen deleting the L from 'lover' to spell 'over' on her laptop, also as a metaphor to contrast with the song's title.
