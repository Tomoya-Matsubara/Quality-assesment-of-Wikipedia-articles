James Olson (author)
James Olson (born Chet Myles Olson; June 27, 1943) is an American philosopher and author. A generalist, his primary focus is on the effects of functional lateralization on consciousness and human behavior. Olson is the author of The Whole-Brain Path to Peace (Origin Press, 2011), a book that seeks to explain human behavior by focusing on mental perspective, the initial stage of perception, rather than on the whole of perception, the body of beliefs that develop from perspective&lt;U+2014&gt;the latter being the more common approach to understanding the roots of behavior.
As shared in Olson&lt;U+2019&gt;s speaking engagements and radio interviews,1234 his passion is to help bring a greater measure of peace on this planet by reducing the level of conflict. The essence of his belief is based on Roger Walcott Sperry&lt;U+2019&gt;s findings that the hemispheres are independently conscious and that conflict can occur between them. Olson believes that mental conflict is initiated in the brain/mind complex with our decisions, and thus the antidote to personal and interpersonal challenges is the mental integration of the views and responses of our two spheres of consciousness.
Early life
Olson was born in Kansas City, Missouri. He grew up on a farm near Waynoka, Oklahoma, and was an active 4-H member. 56
A former church deacon,78 Olson began with a core of conservative Christian values, which were later supplemented by more liberal values and the study of other religions as a result of having lived in Paris, France, Vienna, Austria, Murnau, Germany, Schw&lt;U+00E4&gt;bisch Hall, Germany, and Iserlohn, Germany.
After attending Oklahoma State University, Stillwater from 1961-1963, and the University of Vienna, Austria in 1963, Olson graduated with a Bachelor of Business Administration degree from the University of Oklahoma, Norman. In 1967 he attended graduate school courses at the University of Missouri-Kansas City, Columbus.
Current, ongoing work
A foundation of Olson&lt;U+2019&gt;s published works is the research and reporting by Roger Walcott Sperry and his then student Michael S. Gazzaniga, the hemispheric studies of Robert Ornstein, and Jill Bolte Taylor's insights into the right hemisphere. Olson found that the dual consciousness discovered by Sperry (for which Sperry won a Nobel Prize in 19819) is fed, and thus informed, by a perspective that is both relatively fixed and at the same time, shifting. Based on each hemisphere's perspective (what the mind initially observes of the environment) and its response to what it perceives (what it does&lt;U+2014&gt;for example, separate or unify), Olson then set out to explain, in detail, the differences between left-brain and right-brain consciousness, resulting in his book, The Whole-Brain Path to Peace.
In July, 2012, Olson published a research paper on the topic of sexual orientation, &lt;U+201C&gt;The Role of Brain Dominance in Sexual Orientation&lt;U+201D&gt;,10 that has garnered critical media recognition in traditional11 and LGBT1213 outlets, based on the prevailing controversies around the topic of sexual orientation.
Following the unifying guidelines of philosophy and drawing on his wide-ranging education, Olson has stated that his mission to help bring the planet&lt;U+2019&gt;s masculine and feminine energies into greater balance, and therefore into a more peaceful state, through his advocacy of whole-brain thinking.14
Previous career
From 1968 &lt;U+2013&gt; 1987, James Olson worked in agriculture in Woods County, Oklahoma, primarily farming wheat and alfalfa.
