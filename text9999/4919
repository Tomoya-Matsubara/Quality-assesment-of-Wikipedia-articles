'''James Paul David "Jim" Bunning''' (born [[October 23]], [[1931]] in [[Southgate, Kentucky]]) is an [[United States|American]] politician who was a [[Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] [[pitcher]] in [[Major League Baseball]] from 1955 to 1971. He subsequently entered electoral politics and was eventually elected to the [[United States Senate]] from Kentucky; he has served there since 1999 as the [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] junior [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]].  He previously served in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] representing Kentucky's 4th Congressional District from 1987 to 1999.

==Education and family==
Jim Bunning graduated from [[St. Xavier High School (Hamilton County, Ohio)|St. Xavier High School]] in [[Cincinnati]] in 1949 and later received a bachelor's degree in economics from [[Xavier University (Cincinnati)|Xavier University]].

In 1952, Bunning married Mary Catherine Theis, with whom he has had five daughters and four sons.

==Major League Baseball Career==

{{MLB HoF}}
Jim Bunning's first game as a major league pitcher was on [[July 20]], [[1955]]. He pitched for the [[Detroit Tigers]] from 1955 to 1963, moving to the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] from 1964 through 1967, to the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] from 1968 through the middle of the 1969 season, finished the 1969 season on the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]], and returned to the Phillies in 1970, retiring in 1971. He wore uniform number 15 on the 1955 Tigers, switched to 14 in 1956, which was the number he wore for the Tigers, Phillies, and Pirates until he was traded to the Dodgers in 1969.  For the Dodgers, he wore number 17, but returned to number 14 on being returned to the Phillies.

Bunning pitched his first [[no-hitter]] on [[July 20]], [[1958]] for the [[Detroit Tigers]] against the [[Boston Red Sox]]. His second was a [[perfect game]], which came against the [[New York Mets]] on [[June 21]], [[1964]], Father's Day. Bunning's perfect game was the first in the National League in 84 years. He is one of only five players to throw a no-hitter in both leagues.  He played in the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Games]] in 1957, 1959, every year from 1961 through 1964, and in 1966.

On [[August 2]], [[1959]], Bunning struck out three batters on nine pitches in the ninth inning of a 5-4 loss to the Boston Red Sox.  Bunning became the fifth American League pitcher and the 10th pitcher in Major League history to accomplish the [[Pitchers who struck out three batters on nine pitches|nine-pitch/three-strikeout half-inning]].  In 1996 he was elected to the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]], via [[Veterans Committee]]. Currently, Jim has received the most votes cast by the [[BBWAA]] during the course of any and all player's Hall of Fame eligibility period collecting well over 3,000 votes.

==Political career==
===Kentucky state politics===
First elected to office in 1977, the ambitious Bunning would serve only two years on the city council of [[Fort Thomas, Kentucky]] before running for and winning a seat in the [[Kentucky Senate]] as a Republican. He was elected minority leader by his Republican colleagues, a rare feat for a freshman legislator.

Bunning was the Republican candidate for [[Governor of Kentucky|governor]] in 1983. He and his running mate [[Eugene P. Stuart]] lost in the general election to [[United States Democratic Party|Democrat]] Martha Layne Colllins.

===Congress===
In 1986, Bunning won the Republican nomination in Kentucky's 4th District, based in Kentucky's share of the [[Cincinnati-Hamilton, OH-KY-IN Metropolitan Statistical Area|Cincinnati metro area]], after 10-term incumbent [[Gene Snyder]] retired. He won easily in the fall and was reelected five more times without serious opposition in what was considered the most Republican district in Kentucky. After the Republicans gained control of the House in 1995, Bunning served as chairman of the [[U.S. House Committee on Ways and Means|House Ways and Means]] Subcommittee on Social Security until 1999.

===First Senate term===
In [[1998]], [[Senate Minority Whip]] [[Wendell Ford]] decided to retire after 24 years in the Senate--the longest term in Kentucky history. Bunning won the Republican nomination for the seat, and faced fellow Congressman [[Scotty Baesler]], a Democrat from the [[Lexington, Kentucky|Lexington]]-based 6th District, in the general election.  Bunning defeated Baesler by just over half a percentage point. The race was very close; Bunning only won by swamping Baesler in the 4th by a margin that Baesler couldn't make up in the rest of the state (Baesler barely won the 6th).

Among the bills that Bunning sponsored is the [[Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2004|Bunning-Bereuter-Blumenauer Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2004]]. He is one of the Senate's most conservative members, gaining high marks from several conservative interest groups.

===Second Senate term===
Bunning was heavily favored for a second term in 2004 after his expected Democratic opponent, Governor [[Paul E. Patton|Paul Patton]], saw his career implode in a scandal over an extramarital affair. Eventually, the Democrats settled on [[Daniel Mongiardo]], a relatively unknown physician and state senator from [[Hazard, Kentucky|Hazard]].

During his reelection bid in 2004, controversy erupted when Bunning described Mongiardo as looking "like one of [[Saddam Hussein]]'s sons." Public distaste compelled him to apologize. Other behavior, including accusing Mongiardo of physically assaulting Bunning's wife&mdash;claiming that his wife was left "black and blue"&mdash;and the revelation that Bunning relied on a [[teleprompter]] during a TV  [[debate]] caused several media analysts to question Bunning's mental state. Bunning set unprecedented conditions on the debate: he could not appear in person due to an important vote held just few hours before the debate and instead was televised from the Republican national headquarters; he refused to allow an independent observer in the room with him; he insisted that no portion of any recording of his performance could be rebroadcast; he insisted that the debate be broadcast live in the afternoon instead of the customary prime time hours; and other conditions. 

After the debate it was leaked that Bunning was using a teleprompter to read previously crafted answers to the questions posed to him during the debate (upon insisting that he receive the questions ahead of time).[http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2004/10/12/bunning_kentucky/print.html] The state's two largest newspapers, the [[The Courier-Journal|''Louisville Courier-Journal'']] and ''[[Lexington Herald-Leader]],'' both called for Bunning to step down; however, both had opposed him previously. 

Bunning had an estimated $4 million campaign war chest, while Mongiardo had only $600,000. The [[United States Democratic Party|Democrats]] began increasing financial support to Mongiardo when it became apparent that Bunning's bizarre behavior was costing him votes, purchasing more than $800,000 worth of additional television airtime on his behalf. 

The race turned out to be very close, with Mongiardo leading with as many as 80% of the returns coming in. However, Bunning eventually won by just over one percentage point. Some analysts felt that had it not been for [[George W. Bush]]'s 20% victory in the state, Mongiardo would have won. As Bunning has won both his elections by very narrow margins, he would be a top target of the [[Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee]] should he stand for reelection in 2010. 

As was expected in light of Bunning's previous career as a baseball player, he has been very interested in Congress's investigation of steroid use in baseball. Bunning has also been outspoken on the issue of [[illegal immigration]] taking the position that all illegal immigrants should be deported.

Bunning was also the only member of the [[United States Senate Banking and Urban Affairs Committee]] to have opposed [[Ben Bernanke]] for Chief of the [[Federal Reserve]]. He claimed it was because he had doubts that he would not be different from [[Alan Greenspan]].

In April 2006, he was selected by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' as one of "America's Five Worst Senators." The magazine dubbed him ''The Underperformer'' for his "lackluster performance", noting he "shows little interest in policy unless it involves baseball", and criticized his hostility towards staff and fellow Senators and his "bizarre behavior" during his 2004 campaign.<ref>Massimo Calabresi and Perry Bacon, Jr., [http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1183986,00.html "Jim Bunning: The Underperformer"], ''[[Time Magazine]]'', April 24, 2006, page 36.</ref>

On [[December 6]], [[2006]], Bunning was one of only two senators (along with [[Rick Santorum]]), to vote against the confirmation of [[Robert Gates]] as [[Secretary of Defense]] claiming that 
{{cquote|Mr. Gates has repeatedly criticized our efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan without providing any viable solutions to the problems our troops currently face. We need a secretary of defense to think forward with solutions and not backward on history we cannot change.}}
