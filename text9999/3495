The [[FAA]]'s '''Pilot Proficiency Award Program''' (Wings) promotes [[air safety]] and encourages [[general aviation]] pilots to continue training and provides an opportunity to practice selected maneuvers in a minimum of instruction time. After you've logged three hours of dual instruction under the program and attended at least one FAA-sanctioned safety seminar, you<U+2019>ll be eligible to receive a distinctive set of wings . You<U+2019>ll also earn a certificate of completion. If you successfully complete a phase of the Wings Program within the period specified by Section 61.56(e) of the [[Federal Aviation Regulations]], you don<U+2019>t need to accomplish the flight review for that time period.

As laid out in Advisory Circular 61-91H, the program has twenty phases and offers you a twenty-year recurrent training opportunity. You<U+2019>ll be eligible for more wings every year after earning your first set, each added set marking your progress.

Phase III wings are [[gold]] tone with a star and wreath. Phase IV wings are gold tone and have a simulated [[ruby]] mounted in the shield. Phase V wings are gold tone with a rhinestone mounted in the shield. Phase VI wings are gold tone with a simulated [[sapphire]] mounted in the shield. Phases VII, VIII, and IX wings are gold tone with the appropriate [[Roman numeral]] displayed within the wreath. Phase X wings are bright gold tone with the Roman numeral X and shield located within a ring of 10 stars.

No complimentary wings will be issued. Pilots, regardless of certificate type, ratings, or position, must earn the privilege of wearing the pilot proficiency wings. A pin and certificate will be awarded for Phases I through X. A certificate only will be awarded for Phases XI through XX.

[[Seaplane]] pilots who specify <U+201C>seawings<U+201D> on the proficiency award application get a distinctive set of seawings.
