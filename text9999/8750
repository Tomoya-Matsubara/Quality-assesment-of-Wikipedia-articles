'''Snowdon''' ({{lang-cy|Yr Wyddfa}}, {{IPA-cy|<U+0259><U+027E> <U+02C8>w<U+0268><U+031E><U+00F0>va|pron}}) is the highest mountain in [[Wales]], at an altitude of {{convert|1085|m}} [[above sea level]], and the highest point in the [[British Isles]] outside [[Scotland]]. It is located in [[Snowdonia National Park]] (''{{lang|cy|Parc Cenedlaethol Eryri}}'') in [[Gwynedd]], and has been described as "probably the busiest mountain in Britain".<ref name="Llanberis">{{cite web |url=http://www.llanberismountainrescue.co.uk/English/LLMRT%20HomePage2.html |publisher=Llanberis Mountain Rescue Team |title=About us |accessdate=January 16, 2010}}</ref> It is designated as a [[national nature reserve]] for its rare flora and fauna.

The rocks that form Snowdon were produced by [[volcano]]es in the [[Ordovician]] period, and the massif has been extensively sculpted by [[glaciation]], forming the [[pyramidal peak]] of Snowdon and the [[ar<U+00EA>te]]s of [[Crib Goch]] and [[Y Lliwedd]]. The cliff faces on Snowdon, including [[Clogwyn Du'r Arddu]], are significant for [[rock climbing]], and the mountain was used by [[Edmund Hillary]] in training for the 1953 ascent of [[Mount Everest]].

Snowdon boasts some of the best views in Britain, and the summit can be reached by a number of well-known paths. The summit can also be reached on the [[Snowdon Mountain Railway]], a [[rack and pinion]] railway opened in 1896 which carries passengers the {{convert|4.7|mi}} from [[Llanberis]] to the summit station. The summit also houses a visitor centre called ''{{lang|cy|Hafod Eryri}}'', built in 2006 to replace one built in the 1930s.

The name ''Snowdon'' is from the [[Old English]] for "snow hill", while the Welsh name <U+2013> ''{{lang|cy|Yr Wyddfa}}'' <U+2013> means "the [[tumulus]]", which may refer to the cairn thrown over the legendary giant [[Rhitta Gawr]] after his defeat by [[King Arthur]]. As well as other figures from Arthurian legend, the mountain is linked to a legendary ''{{lang|cy|[[afanc]]}}'' (water monster) and the {{lang|cy|[[Tylwyth Teg]]}} (fairies).
__TOC__
==Height==
A 1682 survey estimated that the summit of Snowdon was at a height of {{convert|3720|ft}}; in 1773, [[Thomas Pennant]] quoted a later estimate of {{convert|3568|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level at [[Caernarfon]].<ref name="Jones"/> Recent surveys give the height of the summit as {{convert|1085|m|abbr=on}}, making Snowdon the highest mountain in Wales, and the highest point in the [[British Isles]] outside [[Scotland]].<ref name="Barnes"/> Snowdon is one of three mountains climbed as part of the [[National Three Peaks Challenge]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thethreepeakschallenge.co.uk/national-three-peaks-challenge/ |title=National Three Peaks Challenge |author= |date=25 February 2011 |accessdate=28 April 2011}}</ref>

==Environment==
===Flora===
[[File:Lloydia serotina snowdon.jpg|thumb|''[[Lloydia serotina]]'', the "Snowdon lily", grows on the cliffs of Snowdon.]]
The unique environment of Snowdon, particularly its rare plants, have led to its designation as a [[national nature reserve]].<ref name="Marsh_Watkin"/> In addition to plants that are widespread in Snowdonia, Snowdon is home to some plants rarely found elsewhere in Britain. The most famous of these is the "Snowdon lily", ''[[Lloydia serotina]]'', which is also found in the [[Alps]] and in North America. It was first discovered by [[Edward Lhuyd]] in Wales, and was later named in his honour by [[Richard Anthony Salisbury|R. A. Salisbury]].<ref>{{cite book |author=David Jones |year=2003 |title=Welsh Wildlife |publisher=[[Y Lolfa]] |isbn=978-0-86243-654-4 |chapter=Flowers |pages=11<U+2013>34 |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=cglEQ0uArk0C&pg=PA23}}</ref> Snowdon lies in the northern part of [[Snowdonia National Park]],<ref>{{cite book |author=Nick Baker & Adrian Phillips |year=2009 |title=The National Trust Book of the Countryside |publisher=[[Anova Books]] |isbn=978-1-905400-69-0 |chapter=Snowdonia |pages=350<U+2013>353 |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=FdLH727swN4C&pg=PA350}}</ref> which has also provided some legal protection since the park's establishment in 1951.<ref>{{cite web |title=National Park facts and figures |url=http://www.nationalparks.gov.uk/press/factsandfigures.htm |publisher=[[Association of National Park Authorities]] |accessdate=December 6, 2011}}</ref>

[[File:Llyn Llydaw - geograph.org.uk - 1236149.jpg|thumb|[[Llyn Llydaw]], the largest and deepest lake on Snowdon's flanks, is crossed by a causeway at its eastern end.]]
A number of lakes are found in the various [[cirque|cwms]] of the Snowdon range.
* [[Llyn Llydaw]] <U+2013> {{convert|1430|ft}} high, {{convert|110|acre}} <U+2013> lies in [[Cwm Dyli]], Snowdon's eastern cwm, and is one of Snowdonia's deepest lakes, at up to {{convert|190|ft|abbr=on}} deep. Various explanations of its name have been put forward, including ''{{Lang|cy|lludw}}'' ("ash"), from ashen deposits along the shore, to ''{{lang|cy|Llydaw}}'' ("[[Brittany]]").<ref name="Roberts_Llydaw">{{harvnb|Roberts|1995|pp=179<U+2013>181}}</ref> It contains evidence of a [[crannog]] settlement, and was the location of a {{convert|10|x|2|ft|adj=on|sigfig=1}} [[dugout canoe]] described in the ''[[Cambrian Journal]]'' in 1862.<ref name="Roberts_Llydaw"/> The lake is significantly coloured by washings from the copper mines nearby, and is used by the Cwm Dyli [[hydroelectric power]] station, which opened in 1906.<ref name="Roberts_Llydaw"/> The lake is crossed by a [[causeway]], built in 1853 and raised in the 20th century to prevent the causeway from flooding frequently.<ref name="Hermon">{{cite book |author=Peter Hermon |year=2006 |title=Hillwalking in Wales, Volume 2 |series=British Hills Series |edition=2nd |publisher=[[Cicerone Press]] |isbn=978-1-85284-468-4 |chapter=The Snowdon Range |pages=237<U+2013>283}}</ref>

==Rock climbing==
[[File:Clogwyn Du'r Arddu - geograph.org.uk - 837339.jpg|thumb|[[Clogwyn Du'r Arddu]] is a significant site for [[rock climbing]].]]
The [[Snowdon Massif]] includes a number of spectacular cliffs, and holds an important place in the history of [[rock climbing]] in the United Kingdom. [[Clogwyn Du'r Arddu]] is often colloquially known as 'Cloggy' among climbers, and was the site of the first recorded climb in Britain, in 1798.<ref name="Marsh"/> It was carried out by two [[botanist]]s, Reverends Peter Williams and [[William Bingley]], while searching for rare plants.<ref name="Marsh"/> It is now considered to be one of the best cliffs in Britain for rock climbing.<ref name="Marsh_Rhyd"/>

[[Y Lliwedd]] was also explored by early climbers, and was the subject of a 1909 climbing guide, ''The Climbs on Lliwedd'' by J. M. A. Thompson and A. W. Andrews, one of the first in Britain.<ref name="Marsh"/> Snowdon was used by [[Edmund Hillary]] and his group during preparations for their successful 1953 expedition to climb [[Mount Everest]].<ref name="Marsh"/>

The first recorded ascent of Snowdon was by the botanist [[Thomas Johnson (botanist)|Thomas Johnson]] in 1639.<ref name="Marsh">{{harvnb|Marsh|1984}}</ref> However, the 18th-century Welsh historian [[Thomas Pennant]] mentions a "triumphal fair upon this our chief of mountains" following [[Edward I of England|Edward I]]'s conquest of Wales in 1284, which could indicate the possibility of earlier ascents.<ref>{{cite book |author=[[Thomas Pennant]] |title=A Tour in Wales |year=1778<U+2013>1783}} Cited by {{harvnb|Marsh|1984}}</ref>

Snowdon offers some of the most extensive views in the British Isles.<ref>{{cite journal |author=David Squires |year=2010 |title=Can Snowdon be seen from the Wrekin?

Snowdon has been described as "probably the busiest mountain in Britain";<ref name="Llanberis"/> a number of well-established footpaths lead to Snowdon's summit from all sides,<ref name="Barnes"/> and can be combined in various ways.<ref name="Rowland">{{cite book |author=E.

During winter, all these routes become significantly more dangerous and many inexperienced walkers have been killed over the years attempting to climb the mountain via the main paths.<ref>{{cite book |author=Steve Ashton |year=2002 |title=Ridges of Snowdonia |series=British Hills Series |edition=2nd |publisher=[[Cicerone Press]] |isbn=978-1-85284-350-2 |chapter=The Snowdon Group |pages=72<U+2013>100 |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=10CqPLA9KQYC&pg=PA73}}</ref>

===Llanberis Path===
The Llanberis Path is the longest route to the summit, and has the shallowest gradient. It follows the line of the [[Snowdon Mountain Railway]], and is considered the easiest and least interesting route to the summit of Snowdon.<ref name="Barnes"/> It is the route used by the annual [[Snowdon Race]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://snowdonrace.co.uk/services/servicesView.aspx?serviceid=1&folder=1 |title=Race route |publisher=[[Snowdon Race]] |accessdate=20 April 2011}}</ref> with a record time of less than 40 minutes recorded from the start to the summit.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://snowdonrace.co.uk/services/servicesView.aspx?serviceid=12&folder=4 |title=Race records |publisher=[[Snowdon Race]] |accessdate=20 April 2011}}</ref>

The section of the Llanberis Path beside the railway near the summit has been called the "Killer Convex"; in icy conditions, this convex slope can send unwary walkers over the cliffs of Clogwyn Du'r Arddu. Four people died there in February 2009.<ref>{{cite news |title=Walker's mountain hike 'madness' |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=30 July 2009 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/8177483.stm}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.ukclimbing.com/articles/page.php?id=1653 |title=Editorial: Recent Deaths on Snowdon |author=Jack Geldard |date=February 2009 |accessdate=29 April 2011 |publisher=[[UK Climbing]]}}</ref>

The Snowdon Ranger Path begins at the [[youth hostel]] beside [[Llyn Cwellyn]], to the west of the mountain, served by the [[A4085 road|A4085]] and [[Snowdon Ranger railway station]]. This was formerly the Saracen's Head Inn, but was renamed under the ownership of the mountain guide John Morton.<ref name="Jones">{{cite web |author=G.

The route begins with [[zigzag]]s through "lush green turf",<ref name="Hermon"/> before reaching a flatter [[bog]]gy area in front of Llyn Ffynnon-y-gwas. The path then climbs to Bwlch Cwm Brwynog, and then snakes along the ridge above Clogwyn Du'r Arddu towards the summit. This path meets the railway, the Llanberis Path, the Crib Goch path, and the combined Pyg Track and Miners' Track all within a short distance, just below the summit.<ref name="Hermon"/>

===Rhyd Ddu Path===
<!--[[File:Bwlch Main, Snowdonia - geograph.org.uk - 1549927.jpg|thumb|The Rhyd Ddu path ascending from Bwlch Main]]-->
The Rhyd Ddu path, also called the Beddgelert Path, leads from the village of [[Rhyd Ddu]], west of Snowdon, gently up on to Llechog, a broad ridge dropping west from the summit.<ref name="Marsh"/> It is considered one of the easier routes to the summit,<ref name="Hermon"/><ref name="Marsh"/> with the advantage that the summit is visible from the start,<ref name="Marsh"/> but is one of the least used routes.<ref name="Marsh_Rhyd">{{harvnb|Marsh|2010|pp=29<U+2013>32}}</ref> It climbs at a shallow gradient to Bwlch Main, shortly southwest of the summit, from where it climbs more steeply, meeting up with the Watkin Path at a site marked with a large standing stone a few hundred metres from the summit.<ref name="Hermon"/> An alternative start begins at [[Pitt's Head]] on the [[A4085 road]].<ref name="Marsh_Rhyd"/>

===Watkin Path===
[[File:Plascwmllan and the Gladstone Rock - geograph.org.uk - 1286451.jpg|thumb|left|Plas Cwmllan (right) and Gladstone Rock (left) in Cwm Llan, looking along the Watkin Path]]
The Watkin Path is "the most demanding route direct to the summit of Snowdon",<ref name="Marsh_Watkin">{{harvnb|Marsh|2010|pp=33<U+2013>36}}</ref> since it starts at the lowest elevation of any of the main routes.<ref name="Hermon"/> It was first conceived by [[Edward Watkin]], a railway owner who had attempted to build a railway tunnel under the [[English Channel]], and had a [[summer home]] in [[Nant Gwynant]] near the start of the path.<ref name="Barnes">{{cite book |author=David Barnes |year=2005 |title=The Companion Guide to Wales |publisher=[[Companion Guides]] |isbn=978-1-900639-43-9 |chapter=Caernarfonshire: Eifionydd; Ll<U+0177>n; Arfon |pages=279<U+2013>315}}</ref> It was originally designed as a donkey track and opened in 1892.<ref name="Hermon"/>

The start of the Watkin Path has been described as "the prettiest beginning" of the routes up Snowdon.<ref name="Hermon"/> It begins at Bethania on the [[A498 road|A498]] and climbs initially through old [[Celtic broadleaf forests|broadleaved woodland]].<ref name="Hermon"/> After leaving the woods, the path climbs past the waterfalls of the Afon Llan to the glacial [[cirque]] of Cwm Llan, crossing a disused [[Inclined plane|incline]] from an abandoned slate quarry.<ref name="Marsh_Watkin"/> It then reaches Plas Cwmllan, formerly the home of the quarry manager for the South Snowdon Slate Works beyond, and later used for [[target practice]] by [[commando]]s during the Second World War.<ref name="Marsh_Watkin"/> Near Plas Cwmllan is the large boulder known as Gladstone Rock, which bears a plaque commemorating a speech given in 1892 by [[William Ewart Gladstone]], the then 83-year-old [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], on the subject of ''Justice for Wales''.<ref name="Hermon"/> The slate workings in Cwm Llan were opened in 1840, but closed in 1882 due to the expense of transporting the slate to the sea at [[Porthmadog]]. Various buildings, including barracks and dressing sheds, remain.<ref name="Marsh_Watkin"/>

From the slate quarries, the Watkin Path veers to the north-east to reach Bwlch Ciliau, the [[col]] between Snowdon and [[Y Lliwedd]], which is marked by a large orange-brown [[cairn]].<ref name="Hermon"/> From here, it heads west to meet the Rhyd Ddu Path at a standing stone shortly below the summit of Snowdon.<ref name="Marsh_Watkin"/>

Scenes from ''[[Carry On... Up the Khyber]]'' were filmed on the lower part of the Watkin Path in 1968, with the Watkin Path representing the [[Khyber Pass]] in the film. One of the stars of the film, [[Angela Douglas]], unveiled a plaque at the precise location where filming took place in 2005 to commemorate the location filming and it forms part of the North Wales Film and Television Trail, run by the Wales Screen Commission.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/north_west/4296396.stm |title=Carry On plaque unveiled |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=30 September 2005}}</ref>

===Over {{lang|cy|Y Lliwedd}}===
[[File:View towards Y Lliwedd from the summit of Yr Wyddfa-Snowdon - geograph.org.uk - 702192.jpg|thumb|[[Y Lliwedd]] (seen here in early Spring) is a sharp ridge south-east of the summit of Snowdon.]]
The route over [[Y Lliwedd]] is more frequently used for descent than ascent, and forms the second half of the Snowdon Horseshoe walk, the ascent being over Crib Goch. It is reached by following the Watkin Path down to Bwlch y Saethau, and then continuing along the ridge to the twin summits of Y Lliwedd.<ref name="Marsh_Horseshoe"/> The path then drops down to Cwm Dyli to join the Miners' Track towards Pen-y-Pass.

===Miners' Track===

The Miners' Track begins at the car park at [[Pen-y-Pass]], at an altitude of around {{convert|350|m}}, and is the most popular route to the summit of Snowdon.<ref name="Marsh"/> It begins by skirting [[Llyn Teyrn]] before climbing slightly to cross the causeway over [[Llyn Llydaw]].<ref name="Marsh"/> It follows the lake's shoreline before climbing to [[Glaslyn]], from where it ascends steeply towards Bwlch Glas. It is joined for most of this zigzag ascent by the Pyg Track, and on reaching the summit ridge, is united with the Llanberis Path and Snowdon Ranger Path.<ref name="Marsh"/> Derelict mine buildings are encountered along several parts of the path.<ref name="Marsh"/>

===Pyg Track===
[[File:Stone Obelisk, Snowdon - geograph.org.uk - 531272.jpg|thumb|upright|This standing stone marks the point where the Pyg Track and Miners' Track descend from the summit ridge.<ref name="Marsh"/>]]
The "Pyg Track", or "Pig Track" (both spellings may be encountered), also leads from Pen-y-Pass.<ref name="Hermon"/> The track climbs over Bwlch y Moch on the eastern flanks of Crib Goch, before traversing that ridge's lower slopes.<ref name="Marsh"/> Above Glaslyn, it is joined by the Miners' Track for the zigzag climb to Bwlch Glas between Snowdon and Garnedd Ugain.<ref name="Marsh"/> Regarding its name, the website of the [[Snowdonia National Park Authority]] states:
<!-- Quotation follows. Fair Use contended. Please do not remove attribution. -->
{{quotation|Nobody knows for sure why this path is called the Pyg Track. It's possible that it was named after the pass it leads through, {{lang|cy|Bwlch y Moch}} (translated Pigs' Pass) as the path is sometimes spelled 'Pig Track'. Or, maybe because it was used to carry '{{lang|cy|pyg}}' (black tar) to the copper mines on Snowdon. Another possible explanation is that the path was named after the nearby Pen y Gwryd Hotel, popular amongst the early mountain walkers.|Snowdonia NPA<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eryri-npa.gov.uk/visiting/walking/Hard-Mountain-Walks/PYG-Track |title=PYG Track |year=2005 |publisher=[[Snowdonia National Park Authority]] |accessdate=23 November 2011}}</ref>}}

===Crib Goch route===
The traverse of {{lang|cy|[[Crib Goch]]}} is "one of the finest ridge walks in Britain",<ref name="Marsh_Horseshoe"/> and forms part of the well-known Snowdon Horseshoe, a circuit of the peaks surrounding Cwm Dyli.<ref name="Marsh"/> The path follows the Pyg Track before separating off from it at {{lang|cy|Bwlch y Moch}} and leading up the side of [[Crib Goch]].

==Summit buildings==
[[File:Hafod Eryri No 1.jpg|thumb|left|{{lang|cy|Hafod Eryri}}, built in 2009]]
The first building on the summit of Snowdon was erected in 1838 to sell refreshments, and a [[Alcohol licensing laws of the United Kingdom|licence to sell intoxicating liquor]] was granted in 1845.<ref name="Marsh"/> Very basic accommodation was also provided for visitors.<ref name="Johnson">{{cite book |author=Peter Johnson |title=An Illustrated History of the Snowdon Mountain Railway |year=2010 |publisher=[[Oxford Publishing Company]] |isbn=978-0-86093-631-2}}</ref> When the [[Snowdon Mountain Railway]] was opened in 1896, it added its own accommodation and sales outlet near the summit.<ref name="Johnson"/> 

During the 1930s, many complaints were received about the state of the facilities at the summit and in 1934/5 a new station building was erected in two phases. It was designed by Sir [[Clough Williams-Ellis]] and included rooms for visitors and a [[caf<U+00E9>]]. The other operators were bought out and the ramshackle collection of buildings on the summit was cleared. The flat roof was intended to be used as a viewing platform and some photographs show it being used in this way. However, other photographs taken of the [[caf<U+00E9>]] show that the roof leaked, which probably explains why the practice was stopped. The Summit was taken over by government agencies during the war and the accommodation was restricted to staff use afterwards.<ref name="Johnson"/><!-- The building displayed a slate plaque with the following couplet: ''{{lang|cy|"Grwydryn, aros ennyd; ystyra ryfeddol waith Duw a'th daith fer ar y ddaear hon."}}'' ("Wanderer, wait a moment; consider God's wondrous work and your short journey on this earth.")--> Having become increasingly dilapidated, this building was described by [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]] as "the highest slum in Wales".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/makeover-for-highest--slum-in-wales-1690633.html |title=Makeover for 'highest slum in Wales' |publisher=[[The Independent]] |date=May 26, 2009 |accessdate=April 13, 2011 |author=Jonathan Brown}}</ref> Its state led to a campaign to replace the building. In April 2006, Snowdonia National Park Authority with the support of the [[Snowdonia Society]] agreed a deal to start work on a new caf<U+00E9> and visitor centre complex.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://icnorthwales.icnetwork.co.uk/news/regionalnews/tm_objectid=16911781&method=full&siteid=50142&headline=snowdon-centre-deal-agreed--name_page.html|title=Snowdon centre deal agreed|publisher = [[Daily Post (North Wales)|Daily Post]]|date=April 6, 2006}}</ref> By mid-October 2006 the old building had been largely demolished.

==Folklore==
[[File:Bedivere.jpg|thumb|upright|In Arthurian legend, [[Bedivere]] threw ''[[Excalibur]]'' into a lake identified by some as [[Glaslyn]] on the slopes of Snowdon.]]
In [[Welsh folklore]], the summit of Snowdon is said to be the [[tomb]] of [[Rhitta Gawr]], a [[Giants (Welsh folklore)|giant]].<ref name="Marsh"/> This is claimed to be the reason for the [[Welsh language|Welsh]] name ''Yr Wyddfa'',<ref name="Hermon"/> literally meaning "the [[tumulus]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/fun/welsh/LexiconForms.html |title=Welsh-English Lexicon |publisher=[[Cardiff University]] |accessdate=1 May 2006}}</ref> Rhitta Gawr wore a cloak made of men's beards, and was slain by [[King Arthur]] after claiming Arthur's beard.<ref name="Roberts_Glaslyn"/> Other sites with [[Arthurian legend|Arthurian]] connections include Bwlch y Saethau, on the ridge between Snowdon and Y Lliwedd, where Arthur himself is said to have died. A cairn, ''Carnedd Arthur'', was erected at the site and was still standing as late as 1850,<ref name="Roberts_Glaslyn"/> but no longer exists.<ref name="Marsh"/> According to the folklore, Arthur had [[Bedivere]] throw his sword ''[[Excalibur]]'' into [[Glaslyn]], where Arthur's body was later placed in a boat to be carried away to [[Afallon]]. Arthur's men then retreated to a cave on the slopes of Y Lliwedd, where they are said to sleep until such time as they are needed.<ref name="Roberts_Glaslyn"/><ref name="Marsh_Horseshoe">{{harvnb|Marsh|2010|pp=25<U+2013>28}}</ref> [[Merlin]] is supposed to have hidden the golden throne of Britain among the cliffs north of Crib y Ddysgl when the Saxons invaded.<ref>{{harvnb|Roberts|1995|pp=143<U+2013>145}}</ref>

Glaslyn was also the final resting place of a water monster, known as an ''{{lang|cy|[[afanc]]}}'' (also the Welsh word for [[beaver]]), which had plagued the people of the [[Conwy valley]]. They tempted the monster out of the water with a young girl, before securing it with chains and dragging it to Glaslyn.<ref name="Roberts_Glaslyn"/><ref name="Marsh"/> A large stone known as Maen Du'r Arddu, below Clogwyn Du'r Arddu, is supposed to have [[magic (paranormal)|magical powers]]. Like several other sites in Wales, it is said that if two people spend the night there, one will become a great poet while the other will become insane.<ref>{{harvnb|Roberts|1995|pp=100<U+2013>101}}</ref> Llyn Coch in Cwm Clogwyn has been associated with the [[Tylwyth Teg]] (fairies), including a version of the [[fairy]] bride legend.<ref>{{harvnb|Roberts|1995|pp=38<U+2013>39}}</ref>
