'''Upper Table Rock''' and '''Lower Table Rock''' are two prominent [[volcanic plateau]]s located just north of the [[Rogue River (Oregon)|Rogue River]] in [[Jackson County, Oregon|Jackson County]], [[Oregon]]. Created by an [[andesite|andesitic]] [[lava|lava flow]] approximately seven million years ago and shaped by erosion, they now stand about {{convert|800|ft|m}} above the surrounding [[Rogue Valley|valley]]. The Table Rocks are jointly owned; [[The Nature Conservancy]] is responsible for {{convert|3591|acre|km2|2}}, while the [[Bureau of Land Management]] is responsible for {{convert|1280|acre|km2|3}}.

The [[Takelma]] tribe of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] inhabited the Table Rocks for at least 15,000 years. Starting in the mid 1800s during a [[gold rush]], [[European American]] settlers forced the Takelma out of the Table Rocks and into [[Indian reservation|reservations]]. The area was quickly developed. The Table Rock post office was established in 1872, an [[Airport#Airstrip|airstrip]] was built atop Lower Table Rock in 1948, and a [[VHF omnidirectional range|very high frequency omni-directional range]] (VOR) aviation tower was constructed on Upper Table Rock in the 1960s. The Table Rocks were not [[Protected area|protected]] until the 1970s.

The rocks are home to over 70 species of animals and 340 species of plants, which includes over 200 species of wildflowers. [[Vernal pool]]s atop the plateaus fill during the rainy season in winter and spring because the andesite is [[Permeability (earth sciences)|impermeable]]. The [[Limnanthes floccosa#Dwarf woolly meadowfoam|Dwarf Woolly Meadowfoam]], a species of wildflower, grows around these pools, and is [[endemism|endemic]] to the rocks. The pools are also one of only a few places where the federally [[threatened species]] of [[fairy shrimp]], ''[[Branchinecta lynchi]]'', can be found. To protect these and other threatened species, the rocks have been listed as an [[Area of Critical Environmental Concern]] by the Bureau of Land Management since 1984.

The Table Rocks are one of the most popular hiking locations in the Rogue Valley, with over 10,000&nbsp;visitors annually. Two trails, Lower Table Rock Trail and Upper Table Rock Trail, were cut across the plateaus in the early 1980s by the [[Youth Conservation Corps]], [[Boy Scout]]s, and the [[Oregon Department of Forestry]].

The plateaus are named Table Rocks because of their relatively flat tops. Upper and Lower refer to their location along the Rogue River, not their height. Upper Table Rock, {{convert|2091|ft|m|1}} above sea level at its highest point, is located upstream, while Lower Table Rock is farther downstream, with an elevation of {{convert|2049|ft|m|1}}.

==Geology and climate==
[[Image:Table Rock from Roxy Ann.jpg|thumb|left|Lower Table Rock across the Rogue Valley from [[Roxy Ann Peak]]|alt=Vegetation in the foreground, with a flat area scattered with buildings farther away. The plateau is far away, with mountains by the horizon.]]

Starting approximately 40 million years ago in the middle [[Eocene]],<ref name="provenance">[[#Henderson|Henderson 2009]]</ref> a [[braided river]] system called the "Ancestral Rogue River" flowed through the region where the Rogue Valley is now carved.<ref name="heller et al.">[[#Heller|Heller 1992]], pp. 1095<U+2013>1098</ref> For about 2.1 million years,<ref name="provenance"/> the river deposited what is now known as the [[Payne Cliffs Formation]] by laying down a thin [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]], followed by [[arkose|arkosic]] [[sandstone]] and [[siltstone]].<ref name="heller et al."/><ref name="Geology">[[#Geology|Geology, Bureau of Land Management]]</ref><ref name="Geology2">[[#Bishop|Bishop 2004]], pp. 34<U+2013>36</ref> Between 20 and 10 million years ago, the [[tectonic uplift|uplift]] that created the nearby [[Klamath Mountains]] caused an incision that formed the Rogue River valley.<ref name="Geology"/> Vertical erosion, or [[downcutting]] of the Rogue River continues to keep pace with the recent uplift, with about {{convert|690|ft|m}} of erosion occurring in the past seven million years.<ref name="cap lava">[[#Hladky|Hladky 1998]]</ref>

Approximately seven million years ago in the upper [[Miocene]], a 44&nbsp;mile (71&nbsp;km) long [[trachyandesite|trachyandesitic]] lava flow that likely came from [[Olson Mountain]] near present-day [[Lost Creek Lake]] flowed down the Ancestral Rogue River and its tributaries and spread throughout the valley.<ref name="Book33">[[#Reyes|Reyes 1994]], p. 33</ref><ref name="cap lava"/> This lava formed a hard cap over the Payne Cliffs Formation.<ref name="cap lava"/> At Lost Creek Lake, the lava attained its maximum thickness of {{convert|730|ft|m}} and thinned to about {{convert|100|to|200|ft|m}} to the north of Medford.

Since the Olson eruption, the Rogue River has [[Erosion|eroded]] 90&nbsp;percent of the lava.<ref name="Geology"/><ref name="Book35">[[#Reyes|Reyes 1994]], p. 35</ref> Though the andesite prevented much erosion to the caps of the Table Rocks, the andesite-capped cliffs eroded from the side as the softer sedimentary units of the Payne Cliffs Formation gave way. Upper and Lower Table Rock both stand {{convert|800|ft|m}} above the valley floor,<ref name="Journal">[[#Seevers|Seevers 1993]]</ref> and just over {{convert|2000|ft|m}} above [[sea level]].<ref name="Book1">[[#Reyes|Reyes 1994]], p. 1</ref> There are approximately {{convert|300|acre|km2}} of level ground on Lower Table Rock, and {{convert|500|acre|km2}} on Upper Table Rock.<ref name="Journal"/> Expansive [[Scree|talus]] fields now surround the plateaus on all sides, creating slopes capable of supporting both plant and animal life.<ref name="More Plants">[[#Horn|Horn 2006]], pp. 82<U+2013>86</ref>

The Table Rocks offer an example of [[inverted topography]], in which previous topographic lows are filled with a resistant rock and become new topographic highs after the erosion of the surrounding region.<ref name="Geology2"/><ref name="Book43">[[#Reyes|Reyes 1994]], p. 43</ref> Each plateau is shaped roughly like a [[horseshoe]] because the lava followed the [[meander]]s of the Ancestral Rogue River.<ref name="Journal"/><ref name="Book41">[[#Reyes|Reyes 1994]], p. 41</ref><ref name="ohs">[[#Cain|Cain, 2003]]</ref>

[[Image:Upper Table Rock from Denman.jpg|thumb|right|Upper Table Rock from the [[Denman Wildlife Area]]|alt=Upper Table Rock from across a field of grass, looking into the central bowl. It rises steeply from the surrounding valley to its flat top.]]
Two caves and two former [[Gold mining|gold mines]] are located at the base of the andesite cap on Upper Table Rock. The caves were created by natural [[Fracture (geology)|fractures]] in the cap, and the gold mines were [[Resource extraction|excavated]] by [[Prospecting|prospectors]] searching for gold in the 19th&nbsp;century. Three are large enough to walk into, with an average width of {{convert|8|ft|m}}, while one is a small [[Pit cave|pit]], dropping {{convert|30|ft|m}} vertically into a pond of water.<ref name="Book40-41">[[#Reyes|Reyes 1994]], pp. 40<U+2013>41</ref>

== Human history ==
Humans have been living in the Table Rock area for at least 15,000&nbsp;years, based on the age of [[Clovis points]] that were discovered in the region.<ref name="Cultural">[[#Tribes|Which tribes lived near the Table Rocks?, Bureau of Land Management]]</ref> The area surrounding the Table Rocks was home to the Takelma people. They gathered food such as [[acorn]]s and [[Hemizonia|tarweed]]<!--Hemizonia fitchii--> seeds, and caught [[salmon]] in the nearby Rogue River. The Takelma also used [[deer]] [[hides]] for clothing.<ref name="Picture">See these interpretive signs: [[:Image:Table Rock Sign 4.jpg|1]], [[:Image:Table Rock Sign 8.jpg|2]].</ref> They had several names for the rocks, including ''Di'tani'' (rock above), ''Titanakh'' (little Indian plums), and possibly ''Kwenphunkh''.<ref name="Book7">[[#Reyes|Reyes 1994]], p. 7</ref><ref>[[#Takelma|Gray 1987]], p. 76</ref> The first use of the names Upper Table Rock and Lower Table Rock is unknown, however the first recorded use was in [[mountain man]] [[James Clyman]]'s journal in 1845.<ref name="Book7"/><ref name="Picture 2">See [[:Image:Table Rock Sign 7.jpg|this]] interpretive sign.</ref>

[[Image:Table Rock Airstrip.jpg|thumb|left|100px|The airstrip on Lower Table Rock|alt=A straight dirt path leading off into the distance with brown weeds surrounding it]]
Some of the first European Americans to visit the area were [[fur trapper]]s lead by [[Peter Skene Ogden]] in 1827.<ref name="Journal"/><ref name="Book7"/> In 1841 the [[United States Exploring Expedition]] passed through the Rogue Valley. Neither mentioned the Table Rocks.<ref name="Book7"/> The gold rush of the early 1850s brought many emigrants to the area, and Table Rock City (later renamed [[Jacksonville, Oregon|Jacksonville]]) was built nearby.<ref name="Book27">[[#Reyes|Reyes 1994]], p. 27</ref><ref name="City">[[#Jacksonville|Jacksonville, ''Mail Tribune'']]</ref><ref name="Jacksonville">[[#Jacksonville2|Jacksonville's Historic Commercial Core, Jacksonville Chamber of Commerce]]</ref> The sudden increase of settlers created conflicts with the [[Rogue River (tribe)|Rogue River Indians]]. This turned into warfare, and several treaties were signed in an attempt to end the hostilities.<ref name="Takelma">[[#Takelma?|What happened to the Takelma?, Bureau of Land Management]]</ref><ref name="watershed">[[#Illinois|United States Forest Service]], p. 1</ref> In June 1851, soldiers of the [[United States Army]] lead by Major [[Philip Kearny]] attacked the Takelma near Lower Table Rock, but the Takelma were prepared. Three of the soldiers were injured, and one died. Major Kearny returned with volunteers from [[Yreka, California|Yreka]], accompanied by [[Joseph Lane]]. The ensuing Battle of Table Rock lasted 10&nbsp;days, and 30&nbsp;Takelma were imprisoned.<ref name="Book20-21">[[#Reyes|Reyes 1994]], pp. 20<U+2013>21</ref>

In September 1853, the Native Americans signed a peace treaty with Joseph Lane, and the [[Treaty with the Rogue River, 1853|Treaty with the Rogue River]] with [[Joel Palmer]], which resulted in their [[Cession|ceding]] {{convert|2500|mi2|km2}} of land for $60,000.<ref>[[#Treaty|Treaty with the Rogue River, 1853, Oklahoma State University]]</ref> The Takelma population underwent their first [[forced migration]] into the [[Table Rock Indian Reservation|Table Rock Reservation]], located between Upper Table Rock and nearby Evans Creek.<ref name="Takelma"/><ref name="Book22">[[#Reyes|Reyes 1994]], p. 22</ref><ref name="Western568">[[#Friedman|Friedman 1990]], p. 568</ref> This Indian reservation remained open for three years,<ref name="Journal"/><ref name=OGN>[[#McArthur|McArthur 2003]], p. 712</ref> while the inhabitants were moved to other reservations.<ref name="Takelma"/><ref>[[#OSA|Request to Open Indian Lands, 1857, Oregon State Archives]]</ref> In January 1856, 400 Indians were moved to the [[Grand Ronde Community|Grande Ronde Reservation]].

Development of the area commenced immediately and in <!--April 25--> 1872 the Table Rock Post Office was established just south of Upper Table Rock and east of Lower Table Rock.<ref name="OGN"/><ref name="PO">[[#PO|Table Rock Post Office (historical), Geographic Names Information System]]</ref> The Table Rock School District was created in 1879.<ref name="Book27"/> In <!--September 14--> 1895 the post office's name was changed to Tablerock, and it was closed in <!--November 15--> 1906.<ref name="OGN"/><ref name="PO"/> Telephones arrived in 1908, and the Table Rock Mutual Telephone Company was established. The school district was merged with [[Central Point, Oregon|Central Point]]'s district in 1948.<ref name="Book29">[[#Reyes|Reyes 1994]], p. 29</ref>

In November 1948, John Day, a local cattle rancher and developer, built a {{convert|3/4|mi|km|adj=on|1}} airstrip on the surface of Lower Table Rock to impress visiting celebrities from [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]]. Day funded residential lots near the landmark with the intent of marketing the lots to the celebrities who used the grassy runway.<ref name="Book30">[[#Reyes|Reyes 1994]], p. 30</ref><ref name="soles">[[#Miller|''Mail Tribune'', March 9, 2009]]</ref> The runway was closed in the late 1980s, but small airplanes still occasionally attempt to land on it.<ref name="Journal"/><ref>[[#Meadowfoam|Dwarf meadowfoam, Oregon Department of Agriculture]]</ref>

[[Image:Lower Table Rock from the south.jpg|thumb|right|Lower Table Rock from ''Kirtland Road'' to the south|alt=Lower Table Rock from across a field. Similar to Upper Table Rock, it rises steeply to its very flat top.]]
The [[Federal Aviation Administration]] has operated a {{convert|25|ft|m|adj=on}} tall very high frequency omni-directional range (VOR) aviation tower on Upper Table Rock since the 1960s.<ref name="Book9">[[#Reyes|Reyes 1994]], p. 9</ref><ref name="mtvandal">[[#Davis|''Mail Tribune'', November 25, 1997]]</ref> The purpose of the tower is to broadcast precise coordinates to nearby aircraft to assist in [[air navigation|navigation]]. The facility is closed to the public due to the threat to the safety of the occupants of the aircraft. However, the structure sustained $40,000 worth of damage in 1997 when vandals unsuccessfully attempted to steal aluminum antennas from the {{convert|15|ft|m|adj=on}} tall [[fiberglass]] shell on the roof of the building.<ref name="mtvandal"/>

The Nature Conservancy became concerned about [[overdevelopment]] in 1978 and launched its largest fundraising project to that date. Raising over $500,000, they purchased {{convert|1881|acres|km2|3}} of Lower Table Rock, creating the ''Lower Table Rock Preserve''.<ref name="Book30"/> Projects include [[Controlled burn|prescribed burning]] and [[invasive species]] removal.<ref name="Nature">[[#LTR|The Nature Conservancy, Lower Table Rock]]</ref> In 1981, the Upper Table Rock Trail was built by the Youth Conservation Corps. A year later, the Lower Table Rock Trail was constructed. The first {{convert|400|ft|m}} of the trail were built by a Central Point Boy Scout troop, while the rest was built by the Oregon Department of Forestry.<ref name="Book31">[[#Reyes|Reyes 1994]], p. 31</ref> In 1984, the Table Rocks were designated as an Area of Critical Environmental Concern by the Bureau of Land Management.<ref name="Journal"/><ref name="blm">[[#Welcome|Welcome to the Table Rocks, Bureau of Land Management]]</ref> In May 2009, The Nature Conservancy bought another {{convert|1710|acre|km2|3}} of land on the Table Rocks for $3.9&nbsp;million, ending private ownership of the rocks.<ref name="Nature2">[[#Fattig3|''Mail Tribune'', May 6, 2009]]</ref>

==Ecological habitats==
[[Image:Table Rock Fence Lizard.jpg|thumb|right|[[Western Fence Lizard]] on Lower Table Rock. A [[Ranunculus occidentalis|Western Buttercup]] is blooming above it.|alt=Tan colored lizard in grass near a rock. A 5-petaled yellow flower is directly above it.]]
Four overlapping ecological regions have been identified on the Table Rocks, with considerable differences in the variety of wildlife found in each. From the outermost base of the rocks, three regions consisting of [[oak savanna]], [[chaparral]], and [[Temperate broadleaf and mixed forests|mixed woodland]] surround the relatively flat tops. The andesite cap is covered by the fourth region, mounded [[prairie]]. This region formed when the caps were slowly eroded by the freezing and thawing of water that seeped into the ground ([[Erosion#Ice erosion|ice erosion]]), which created layers of mounded soil.<ref name="Book79">[[#Reyes|Reyes 1994]], p. 79</ref><ref name="Plants">[[#Plants|Plant Communities, Bureau of Land Management]]</ref> Vernal pools fill in from October to June in the mounded prairie area due to the andesite's impermeability. The pools support species of plants and animals.

Over 340&nbsp;species of plants grow on the rocks, including approximately 200&nbsp;species of wildflowers.<ref name="More Plants"/><ref name="Number">[[#Pollock|''Joy Magazine'', January 16, 2008]]</ref> Some of the most common wildflowers are [[Ranunculus occidentalis|buttercups]], [[Lomatium|desert parsley]]<!--Lomatium dissectum or ultriculatum-->, [[Lupinus bicolor|Bicolor Lupine]], and [[Lasthenia californica|California Goldfields]].<ref name="Journal"/><ref name="Wildflowers">[[#Lorain|Lorain 2004]], p. 60</ref> [[Camassia quamash|Camas]] and [[Death Camas]] also grow on the rocks.

More than 70&nbsp;species of animals are known to live on the Table Rocks.<ref name="Journal"/> Lizards such as the [[Western fence lizard|Western Fence Lizard]], [[Southern Alligator Lizard]], and [[Western Skink]] have been seen in all four regions of the Table Rocks. [[Crotalus viridis|Western Rattlesnakes]] and two species of [[garter snake]]s also live in all regions.<ref name="Journal"/><ref name="Book51,54">[[#Reyes|Reyes 1994]], pp. 51, 54</ref><ref name="Reptiles">[[#Reptiles|Reptiles and Amphibians of the Table Rocks, Bureau of Land Management]]</ref> [[Black-tailed Deer|Black-tailed Deer]], [[Coyote]]s, and [[Bobcat]]s are some of the mammals that live on the Table Rocks.

The Table Rocks experience a [[Mediterranean climate]]. The average wind speed in the area is less than {{convert|6|mph|km/h}}, and the annual [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] is approximately {{convert|18|in|mm}} due to the [[rain shadow]] created by the [[Klamath Mountains]]. It rarely snows in the winter.<ref name="Book7"/>

===Oak savanna===
[[Image:Table Rock Galls.jpg|thumb|left|Galls on an oak tree on Lower Table Rock|alt=Two round, brown spheres attached to a small plant]]
Oak savanna is a type of [[grassland]] scattered with oak trees, found on the lowest slopes of the Table Rocks. Fires were often set in the oak savanna and chaparral regions by the Takelma tribe to prevent brush overgrowth, creating [[foraging]] areas for animals such as deer and [[Elk]]. It also prevented large [[wildfires]].<ref name="Fire">[[#Fire|Anthropogenic Fire, Bureau of Land Management]]</ref> [[Quercus garryana|White Oak]] and [[Ponderosa Pine]] are the most common trees found in the region.<ref name="Book79-80">[[#Reyes|Reyes 1994]], pp. 79<U+2013>80</ref><ref name="Oak Savanna">[[#Oak|Oak Savanna, Bureau of Land Management]]</ref> [[Ceanothus cuneatus|Buckbrush]], [[Arctostaphylos viscida|Manzanita]], [[Pacific Madrone]], [[Ceanothus integerrimus|Deerbrush]], [[Cercocarpus betuloides|Mountain Mahogany]], and [[Toxicodendron diversilobum|Poison-oak]] are also common.<ref name="Journal"/><ref name="More Plants"/><ref name="Book90,93<U+2013>94">[[#Reyes|Reyes 1994]], pp. 90, 93<U+2013>94</ref>

Snakes such as the [[Diadophis punctatus|Ringneck Snake]], [[Coluber constrictor|Western Yellow-bellied Racer]], [[Striped Whipsnake]], and [[Pituophis catenifer|Gopher Snake]] live in the oak savanna region.<ref name="Journal"/><ref name="Reptiles"/><ref name="Book54">[[#Reyes|Reyes 1994]], p. 54</ref> Birds such as [[Oak Titmouse|titmice]], [[Ash-throated Flycatcher|flycatchers]], [[White-breasted Nuthatch|nuthatches]], [[Western Bluebird|bluebirds]], [[Violet-green Swallow|swallows]], [[Acorn Woodpecker|woodpeckers]], [[Black-headed Grosbeak|grosbeaks]], and [[American Kestrel|kestrels]] have also been found in this region.<ref name="Journal"/><ref name="Birds"/><ref name="Book64-66">[[#Reyes|Reyes 1994]], pp. 64<U+2013>66</ref> The rocks are known to be the northernmost place [[Blue-gray Gnatcatcher]]s inhabit.<ref name="Nature"/><ref name="Book74">[[#Reyes|Reyes 1994]], p. 74</ref><ref name="Western730">[[#Friedman|Friedman 1990]], p. 730</ref> [[Gall wasp]]s live in this area, often forming [[Oak apple|galls]] in oak trees by injecting their [[larva]] into the leaves.<ref name="Geology2"/>

===Chaparral===
Chaparral is a type of [[scrubland|shrubland]], receiving very little precipitation. [[Sclerophyll]]ous plants such as manzanita and buckbrush grow in this area, both relying on fire to reproduce.<ref name="Journal"/><ref name="Book80">[[#Reyes|Reyes 1994]], p. 80</ref><ref name="Chaparral">[[#Chaparral|Chaparral, Bureau of Land Management]]</ref> The rare [[Fritillaria gentneri|Gentner's frittilary]] also grows in this region.<ref name="Interpretive">[[#Interpretive|Lower Table Rock Accessible Interpretive Trail Environmental Assessment, Bureau of Land Management]]</ref>

[[American Black Bear|Black bears]] have been spotted in the chaparral region, usually in the fall.<ref name="Book61"/> The most common birds include titmice and the [[Acorn Woodpecker]]. Blue-gray Gnatcatchers, [[Lesser Goldfinch|goldfinches]], and the [[Anna's Hummingbird]] have also been seen.<ref name="Journal"/><ref name="Birds"/><ref name="Book66-67">[[#Reyes|Reyes 1994]], pp. 66<U+2013>67</ref>

===Mixed woodland===
The mixed woodland region is a dense forest with many species of trees, located near the tops of the plateaus. The forest [[Canopy (biology)|canopy]] shades the ground, resulting in a cooler temperature. The canopy also reduces the amount of water [[evaporation]]. [[California Black Oak|Black Oak]], [[Coast Douglas-fir|Douglas-fir]], Pacific Madrone, [[Calocedrus decurrens|Incense-cedar]], and other plants grow in the mixed woodland.<ref name="Journal"/><ref name="More Plants"/><ref name="Mixed Woodland">[[#Mixed|Mixed Woodland, Bureau of Land Management]]</ref> Shrubs such as [[Oregon-grape]], [[Lonicera interrupta|honeysuckle]], [[Sambucus|elderberry]]<!--Sambucus cerulea-->, and [[Toxicodendron diversilobum|Poison-oak]] also grow here. The soil in this area is mostly [[loam]].<ref name="Journal"/><ref name="Book80"/>

Rodents such as the [[California Ground Squirrel]], [[Western Gray Squirrel]], and [[Dusky-footed Woodrat]] live in this region.<ref name="Journal"/><ref name="Book59-60">[[#Reyes|Reyes 1994]], pp. 59<U+2013>60</ref><ref name="Mammals">[[#Mammals|Mammals of the Table Rocks, Bureau of Land Management]]</ref> Birds such as grosbeaks, flycatchers, [[Western Tanager|tanagers]], and [[Lazuli Bunting|buntings]] are common in the area. Nine species of [[New World warbler|warblers]], three species of [[vireo]]s, and two species of [[Thrush (bird)|thrushes]] can also be found. The [[Pileated Woodpecker]] has been spotted rarely in large pine trees.<ref name="Journal"/><ref name="Birds"/><ref name="Book66-67"/>

===Mounded prairie and vernal pools===
[[Image:Table Rock Mounded Prairie.jpg|thumb|right|<small>Mounded prairie with [[Roxy Ann Peak]] in the distance. Hikers can be seen in the center of the picture.</small>|alt=Flat field with rocks scattered around it, covered with red grass. Trees are in the distance.]]
The mounded prairie region is located on top of the plateaus, characterized by many species grasses and wildflowers around the vernal pools, with mounds of soil created by erosion. The Dwarf Woolly Meadowfoam, a plant endemic to the Table Rocks, grow near these pools.<ref name="Journal"/><ref name="Nature"/><ref name="Western730"/> They bloom for about ten days in April.<ref name="Book8">[[#Reyes|Reyes 1994]], p. 8</ref> When filled, the pools are also a known habitat for the vernal pool fairy shrimp (''Branchinecta lynchi''), a threatened species, which are found in the winter and early spring.<ref name="Vernal Pools">[[#Mounded|Mounded Prairie/Vernal Pools, Bureau of Land Management]]</ref><ref name="Fairy Shrimp">[[#Fairy|Fairy Shrimp Found on Southern Oregon Preserves, The Nature Conservancy]]</ref>

Two types of [[amphibian]]s are found in the mounded prairie region, typically around vernal pools.

==Trails==
[[Image:Upper Table Rock Trail.jpg|thumb|right|Upper Table Rock Trail|alt=Gravel trail winding through thick vegetation.]]
The Table Rocks offer one of the most popular hiking locations in the Rogue Valley, with over 10,000&nbsp;visitors annually.<ref name="blm"/><ref name="Book3">[[#Reyes|Reyes 1994]], p. 3</ref> Over 4,600&nbsp;people per year participate in guided hikes through the Table Rock Environmental Education Program, hosted by the Bureau of Land Management and The Nature Conservancy.<ref name="Program">[[#Environmental|Environmental Education, Bureau of Land Management]]</ref> Upper Table Rock features a [[Trail#Walking trails|walking trail]] which climbs approximately {{convert|720|ft|m}} to the top of the plateau over {{convert|1.25|mi|km}}. Lower Table Rock also has a walking trail, {{convert|1.75|mi|km}} long, ascending approximately {{convert|780|ft|m}}.<ref name="Hiking">[[#Hiking|Hiking the Table Rocks, Bureau of Land Management]]</ref><ref name="Healthy">[[#Lee|''Mail Tribune'', May 19, 2008]]</ref> It has eight [[Commons:Upper and Lower Table Rock#Interpretive Signs|interpretive panels]] along its length, explaining the history, flora, and fauna of the region. The trails are the most popular with hikers between March and May, when the wildflowers are in bloom. Another peak occurs in September through October.<ref name="Interpretive"/> Landmarks such as [[Mount McLoughlin]], [[Mount Ashland]], [[Roxy Ann Peak]], and [[Pilot Rock (Jackson County, Oregon)|Pilot Rock]] are visible from the edge of the rocks.<ref name="Hiking"/><ref name="Healthy"/>

The Youth Conservation Corps, Boy Scouts, and the Oregon Department of Forestry built the trails leading to the tops of the Table Rocks in the early 1980s, around the same time the plateaus were being nominated as an Area of Critical Environmental Concern.<ref name="Book31"/><ref name="blm"/> In June 1999, only two small trees were cut when [[Shady Cove, Oregon|Shady Cove]] contractor Randy Hodges rerouted a {{convert|3/4|mi|km|adj=on}} section of the Lower Table Rock trail to accommodate the growing number of visitors. The project involved decommissioning the old section and expanding the parking lot, and {{convert|2200|ft|m}} of new trail was installed. Measures to protect the trail were implemented, such as installing rock [[waterbar]]s and a layer of shale gravel over the clay.<ref name="hikeimprove">[[#Fattig|''Mail Tribune'', June 24, 1999]]</ref>

In 2005, a program to build an interpretive trail began on Lower Table Rock near the [[trailhead]]. Prior to construction, some persons with [[Disability|disabilities]], children, or the elderly may have been prevented from using either of the Table Rocks due to the steep terrain and narrow paths. The finished project involved making a {{convert|500|ft|m|adj=on}} section of trail [[Accessibility|accessible]] and adding a {{convert|1/2|mi|km|adj=on|1}} long section of new trail for general public use.<ref name="Interpretive"/>

Both trails lead to spectacular views of the surrounding areas,<ref name="Hiking" /> but have inherent dangers as well. The thick andesite caps have heavily eroded, leaving tall crumbling columns near the edges. In April 2007 a 22-year-old [[Medford, Oregon|Medford]] man fell to his death while climbing.<ref>[[#MT|''Mail Tribune'', April 29, 2007]]</ref> Another man fell {{convert|100|ft|m}} in 2007, but survived.<ref name="tragic">[[#Lemon|''Mail Tribune'', April 30, 2007]]</ref> In 2008, a man from [[Central Point, Oregon|Central Point]] tumbled through a rock shaft to his death and was not found for over six months.<ref>[[#Burke|''Mail Tribune'', January 6, 2009]]</ref>
