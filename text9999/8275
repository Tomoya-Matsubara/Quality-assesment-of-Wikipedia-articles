'''''Apatosaurus''''' (meaning "deceptive reptile" {{IPAc-en|<U+0259>|<U+02CC>|p|<U+00E6>|t|<U+0275>|<U+02C8>|s|<U+0254>r|<U+0259>|s}}) is an [[extinct]] [[genus]] of [[sauropod]] [[dinosaur]] that lived in North America during the [[Late Jurassic]] [[period (geology)|period]]. The genus was first described in 1877 when [[Othniel Charles Marsh]] named ''A. ajax'', and many species have since been described. They range in age from about 154 to 150 million years ago throughout the [[Kimmeridgian]] and early [[Tithonian]] ages of the [[Morrison Formation]]. Among the species is ''A. excelsus'', long considered to be separate under the genus ''Brontosaurus'', which is now considered a [[junior synonym]] of ''Apatosaurus''. It had an average length of {{convert|22.8|m|ft|abbr=on}} and a mass of at least {{convert|16.4|MT|ST}}, although a few specimens indicate a length up to 30% greater and a weight of {{convert|33|-|73|t|LT ST|abbr=on}}. ''Apatosaurus'' was one of the more common sauropods in the Morrison, along with ''[[Diplodocus]]'' and ''[[Camarasaurus]]''.

The cervical vertebrae were less elongated and more heavily constructed than those of ''Diplodocus'' and the bones of the leg were much stockier despite being longer, implying that ''Apatosaurus'' was a more robust animal. The tail was held above the ground during normal locomotion. Like all sauropods, ''Apatosaurus'' had only one claw on the forelimbs and three on its hindlimbs. The skull of ''Apatosaurus'', long thought to be similar to ''Camarasaurus'', is much more similar to that of ''Diplodocus''.

''Apatosaurus'' is a genus in the family [[Diplodocidae]]. It is more [[basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] than other genera like ''Diplodocus'' and ''[[Barosaurus]]'', and is sometimes included in its own subfamily, [[Apatosaurinae]]. ''Apatosaurus'' is one of the more common sauropods in the Morrison Formation, and is often found associated with skeletons of ''[[Allosaurus]]'', ''Camarasaurus'', ''[[Stegosaurus]]'' and ''Diplodocus''. ''Apatosaurus'' is also one of the longer Morrison dinosaurs, although ''[[Supersaurus]]'' exceeds it.

==Description==
[[File:Apatosaurus scale mmartyniuk wiki.png|thumb|left|Comparison of three specimens and a human: Oklahoma specimen of ''A. ajax'' (orange), ''A. louisae'' (red), and ''A. excelsus'' (green)]]
''Apatosaurus'' was a large, long-necked [[quadruped]]al animal with a long, whip-like tail. Its forelimbs were slightly shorter than its hindlimbs. Most size estimates are based on specimen CM 3018 (the [[type (biology)|type specimen]] of ''A. louisae''), which reached  {{convert|21|-|22.8|m|ft|abbr=on}} in length<ref name=Seebacher01/><ref name="mazzettaetal2004"/> and {{convert|16.4|-|22.4|t|LT ST|abbr=on|0}} in weight,<ref name=Seebacher01/><ref name=henderson/> though past estimates have been as high as {{convert|35|t|LT ST|abbr=on}}.<ref name=Seebacher01/> One of the first estimates of ''A. louisae'' was found to be {{convert|21.8|m|ft|abbr=on}}, found by measuring the vertebral column.<ref name="gilmore36"/> Undescribed specimens like OMNH 1670 represent individuals 11-30% longer, suggesting weights double that of CM 3018 or {{convert|33|-|73|t|LT ST|abbr=on|0}}, potentially rivalling the largest titanosaurs.<ref name="wedel2013"/>
[[File:Apatosaurus skull.jpg|thumb|Skull of a specimen nicknamed "Max", [[Aathal Dinosaur Museum]]]]
The skull was small in comparison with the size of the animal. The jaws were lined with spatulate (chisel-like) teeth, suited to a herbivorous diet.<ref name="fastovsky"/> The snout of ''Apatosaurus'' and similar [[diplodocoidea|diplodocoids]] are squared, with only ''[[Nigersaurus]]'' having a squarer skull.<ref name="whitlock11"/> The braincase of ''Apatosaurus'' is well preserved in specimen BYU 17096. The bones are articulated, and their fusion indicates that the bones are mature. The braincase was placed in a phylogenetic analysis, and its morphology was found to be very similar to that of other diplodocoids.<ref name="balanoff2010"/> Some skulls of ''Apatosaurus'' have been found still in articulation with their teeth. Those teeth that have the enamel surface exposed do not have any scratches on the surface, and instead display a sugary texture and little wear.<ref name="whitlock11"/>
[[File:Apatosaurus louisae by durbed.jpg|thumb|[[Paleoart|Artistic interpretation]] of ''A. louisae'']]
Like those of other sauropods, the vertebrae of the neck were deeply bifurcated; that is, they carried paired spines, resulting in a wide and deep neck.<ref name="fastovsky"/> The vertebral formula was: 15 cervicals, 10 dorsals, 5 sacrals, and 82 caudals. The caudal vertebra number was noted to differ individually, even within a species. The cervical vertebrae were stouter than other [[diplodocid]]s, and found to be most similar to ''Camarasaurus'' by [[Charles Whitney Gilmore]]. The Atlas-Axis complex of the first cervicals is nearly fused in ''Apatosaurus louisae''. The dorsal ribs are not fused or tightly attached to their vertebrae, instead loosely articulated.<ref name="gilmore36"/> There are ten dorsal ribs on either side of the body.<ref name="riggs-1903"/> The large neck was filled with an extensive system of weight-saving air sacs. ''Apatosaurus'', like its close relative ''[[Supersaurus]]'', has tall spines on its vertebrae, which make up more than half the height of the individual bones. The shape of the tail is unusual for a diplodocid, being comparatively slender, due to the vertebral spines rapidly decreasing in height the farther they are from the hips. ''Apatosaurus'' also had very long ribs compared to most other diplodocids, giving it an unusually deep chest.<ref name=LHW07/> As in other diplodocids, the last portion of the tail of ''Apatosaurus'' possessed a whip-like structure.<ref name="gilmore36"/>
[[File:Dinosaur mayse shoulder blade.jpg|thumb|left|Shoulder blade of ''Apatosaurus'' in excavation]]
The limb bones were also very robust.<ref name=LHW07/> Within the genus, the [[scapula]] of ''A. louisae'' is intermediate in morphology between those of ''A. ajax'' and ''A. excelsus''. The arm bones are snout, with the [[humerus]] resembling that of ''Camarasaurus'', and those of ''A. excelsus'' and ''A. ajax'' nearly identical. Gilmore in 1936 noted that previous reconstructions erroneously proposed that the [[radius]] and [[ulna]] could cross, when in life they would have remained parallel.<ref name="gilmore36"/> ''Apatosaurus'' had a single large claw on each forelimb, and the first three toes possessed claws on each hindlimb. The phalangeal formula is 2-1-1-1-1, meaning that the innermost finger (phalange) on the forelimb has two bones, the next has one, etc.<ref name="martin06"/> Even by 1936 it was recognized that no sauropod manus preserved more than one claw,<ref name="gilmore36"/> a feature currently recognised for the entire group.<ref name="upchurchmanus"/> The single manual [[ungual]] is slightly curved, and squarely truncated on the anterior end. The pelvic girdle includes the robust [[ilium bone|ilia]], and the coosified [[pubic bone|pubes]] and [[ischium|ischia]]. The femora of ''A. louisae'' are the stoutest of any member of Sauropoda. Rugosities are present on both ends of the femur, and the top end protrudes above the [[great trochanter]]. The tibia and fibula bones are nearly indistinguishable from those of ''Camarasaurus'', although they are different from the slender bones of ''Diplodocus''. The fibula is longer than the tibia, although it is also more slender. The foot of ''Apatosaurus'' has three claws on the innermost digits, and the digit formula is 3-4-5-3-2. In an individual of ''A. louisae'', the [[astragalus]] was not found fused to the tibia. The stoutest metatarsal is in digit 1, and the third metatarsal is the second stoutest.<ref name="gilmore36"/>

==Classification==
[[File:Skeleton of Apatosaurus ajax.jpg|thumb|upright|''A. ajax'' specimen NSMT-PV 20375]]
''Apatosaurus'' is a member of the [[Family (biology)|family]] [[Diplodocidae]], a [[cladistics|clade]] of gigantic [[sauropod]] [[dinosaur]]s. The family includes some of the longest creatures ever to walk the earth, including ''[[Diplodocus]]'', ''Supersaurus'', and ''[[Barosaurus]]''. ''Apatosaurus'' is sometimes classified in the subfamily [[Apatosaurinae]], which may also include ''Suuwassea'', ''Supersaurus'' and ''[[Eobrontosaurus]]''.<ref name=LHW07/><ref name="taylornaish05"/><ref name="harris06"/> [[Othniel Charles Marsh]] described ''Apatosaurus'' as being allied to ''Atlantosaurus'', within the now defunct group [[Atlantosauridae]].<ref name="riggs-1903"/><ref name="marsh1877"/> In 1878, Marsh raised his family to the rank of suborder, including ''Apatosaurus'', ''Atlantosaurus'', ''[[Morosaurus]]'' (=''Camarasaurus'') and ''Diplodocus''. He classified this group within Sauropoda. In 1903, [[Elmer S. Riggs]] mentioned that the name Sauropoda would be a junior synonym of earlier names, and grouped ''Apatosaurus'' within [[Opisthocoelia]].<ref name="riggs-1903"/> Most authors still use Sauropoda as the group name.<ref name="Upchurch05"/> John Whitlock published a study in 2011 placing ''Apatosaurus'' as the most [[basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] diplodocid, a placement that is often supported.<ref name="whitlock2011"/><ref name="gallinaetal2014"/>

==Discovery and species==
[[File:Brontosaurus skeleton 1880s.jpg|thumb|An 1896 diagram of the ''A. excelsus'' holotype skeleton by [[Othniel Charles Marsh|O.C. Marsh]]. The head is based on material now assigned to ''[[Brachiosaurus]] sp.'']]
Marsh, a Professor of [[Paleontology]] at [[Yale University]], described and named an incomplete (and juvenile) skeleton of ''Apatosaurus ajax'' in 1877.<ref name="marsh1877"/> The composite term ''Apatosaurus'' comes from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] words ''apate'' ({{lang|grc|<U+1F00><U+03C0><U+03AC><U+03C4><U+03B7>}})/''apatelos'' ({{lang|grc|<U+1F00><U+03C0><U+03B1><U+03C4><U+03B7><U+03BB><U+03CC><U+03C2>}}) meaning "deception"/"deceptive" and ''sauros'' ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:<U+03C3><U+03B1><U+1FE6><U+03C1><U+03BF><U+03C2>|<U+03C3><U+03B1><U+1FE6><U+03C1><U+03BF><U+03C2>]]}}) meaning "lizard";<ref name="liddell"/> thus, "deceptive lizard". Marsh gave it this name based on the [[chevron (anatomy)|chevron]] bones, which were dissimilar from those of other dinosaurs and instead possessed similarities with [[mosasaur]] chevrons.<ref name="marsh1877"/><ref name="Holtz2008"/> Two years later, Marsh announced the discovery of a larger and more complete specimen at [[Como Bluff]] [[Wyoming]]<U+2014>which, because of discrepancies including the size difference, he identified it as belonging to an entirely new genus and species. He named the new species ''Brontosaurus excelsus'',<ref name="riggs-1903"/><ref name="marsh1879"/> meaning "thunder lizard", from the Greek ''bront<U+0113>/<U+03B2><U+03C1><U+03BF><U+03BD><U+03C4><U+03B7>'' meaning "thunder" and ''sauros/<U+03C3><U+03B1><U+03C5><U+03C1><U+03BF><U+03C2>'' meaning "lizard",<ref name="liddell"/> and from the [[Latin]] ''excelsus'', "noble" or "high".<ref name="LatDict"/> In 1877 the Morrison Formation became the center of the [[Bone Wars]], a fossil-collecting rivalry between early paleontologists Othniel Charles Marsh and [[Edward Drinker Cope]]. It is for this reason that the publications and descriptions of taxa by Marsh and Cope were rushed at the time.<ref name="BMunpublished"/>
[[File:Sharp lull brontosaurus.jpg|thumb|left|Obsolete mount of specimen AMNH 460 with sculpted skull, [[American Museum of Natural History]]]]
The finds<U+2014>the largest dinosaur ever discovered at the time and nearly complete, lacking only a head, feet, and portions of the tail<U+2014>were then prepared for what was to be the first mounted display of a sauropod skeleton, assembled at the American Museum of Natural History under the guidance of [[Henry Fairfield Osborn]] in 1905.<ref name="Bakker"/><ref name="camarasaurusbully"/> The missing bones were created using known pieces from close relatives of ''Brontosaurus''. Sauropod feet that were discovered at the same quarry were added, a tail fashioned to appear as earlier Marsh believed it should with too few vertebrae, and a sculpted model of what the museum felt the skull of this massive creature might look like. This was not a delicate skull like that of ''Diplodocus'', which would later turn out to be more accurate, but was based on "the biggest, thickest, strongest skull bones, lower jaws and tooth crowns from three different quarries".<ref name="gilmore36"/><ref name="riggs-1903"/><ref name="Bakker"/><ref name="mcintosh&berman1975"/> These skulls were likely those of ''Camarasaurus'', the only other sauropod for which good skull material was known at the time. The mount construction was overseen by Adam Hermann, who failed to find ''Apatosaurus'' skulls. Unlike what is thought that the mounts used skulls of ''Camarasaurus'', Hermann was instead forced to sculpt a stand-in skull by hand. Osborn noted in a publication that the skull was "largely conjectural and based on that of ''Morosaurus''" (now ''Camarasaurus'').<ref name="camarasaurusbully"/>
[[File:Field Museum Apatosaurus mount, 1909.jpg|thumb|Unfinished ''A.'' sp. mount (FMNH P25112) in the Field Museum of Natural History, 1909]]
Despite the much-publicized debut of the mounted skeleton, which cemented the name ''Brontosaurus'' in the public consciousness, Riggs had published a paper in the 1903 edition of ''Geological Series of the Field Columbian Museum'' that argued that ''Brontosaurus'' was not different enough from ''Apatosaurus'' to warrant its own genus, and created the combination ''Apatosaurus excelsus''. Riggs stated that "In view of these facts the two genera may be regarded as synonymous. As the term 'Apatosaurus' has priority, 'Brontosaurus' will be regarded as a synonym".<ref name="riggs-1903"/> Since Riggs published his opinions, almost all paleontologists have agreed that the two species should be classified together in a single genus. According to the rules of the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature|ICZN]] (which governs the scientific names of animals), the name ''Apatosaurus'', having been published first, had priority as the official name; ''Brontosaurus'' is considered a [[Synonym (taxonomy)|junior synonym]] and has therefore been discarded from formal use.<ref name="taylor10"/><ref name="endeavour"/>

Despite this, at least one paleontologist<U+2014>[[Robert T. Bakker]]<U+2014>argued in the 1990s that ''A. ajax'' and ''A. excelsus'' are in fact sufficiently distinct that the latter continues to merit a separate genus.<ref name="Bakker98"/> This idea has not been accepted by most palaeontologists.<ref name="Dinosauria04"/><ref name="Macintosh"/>

In 1903 Riggs also described a new specimen of ''Apatosaurus'', which was then placed in the collections of the Field Columbian Museum. Found near the Grand River Valley of Fruita, Colorado, the last cervical vertebrae were exposed from the hillside. Those cervicals were articulated with the thoratic vertebrae, which were excavated from the slope. Ten feet downhill, the distal end of a femur could be seen in the matrix. The rocks were so hard that drills and dynamite had to be used to extract the specimen. Nearly the entire rear of the skeleton was uncovered, measuring {{convert|18|ft|m|disp=flip|abbr=on}}. Apparently when first preserved, the entire skeleton was present, but the cervical vertebrae and forelimbs were eroded away.<ref name="riggs-1903"/>
[[File:Yale Peabody Apatosaurus skull sculpt.jpg|thumb|left|Hypothetical skull, sculpted in 1931, Yale Peabody Museum]]
The skull, from the Carnegie Quarry expeditions by Earl Douglass, was found a few meters away from a skeleton identified as ''Apatosaurus'', soon named ''A. louisae'', after Andrew Carnegie's wife Louise. The skull was designated as CM 11162, and bore a very similar morphology to skulls of ''Diplodocus''. It was accepted as belonging to the ''Apatosaurus'' by Douglass and Carnegie Museum director William H. Holland, although the scientific consensus was that it was of a different genus. Holland defended his view in 1914 in an address to the Paleontological Society of America, yet he left the museum mount headless. While some thought Holland was attempting to avoid conflict with Obsorn, Keith Parsons suspected that Holland was waiting until an articulated skull and neck were found to confirm the association of the skull and skeleton. After Holland's death in 1934, a cast of a ''Camarasaurus'' skull ended up being placed on the mount.<ref name="parsons"/>
[[File:Apatosaurus ajax skull.jpg|thumb|Authentic ''A. ajax'' skull, specimen CMC VP 7180]]
At the Yale Peabody Museum, a skeleton was mounted in 1931 with a skull unique from all the others, while at the time most museums were using ''Camarasaurus'' casts, the Peabody Museum sculpted a completely different skull. They based the lower jaw off a ''Camarasaurus'' mandible, with the cranium resembling Marsh's 1891 illustration. The skull also included forward-pointing nasals, something truly different from any dinosaur, and fenestrae differing from the drawing and other skulls.<ref name="camarasaurusbully"/>

No ''Apatosaurus'' skull was mentioned in literature until the 1970s when John Stanton McIntosh and David Berman redescribed the skulls of ''Diplodocus'' and ''Apatosaurus''. They found that though he never published his opinion, Holland was almost certainly correct, that ''Apatosaurus'' had a ''Diplodocus'' like skull. According to them, many skulls long thought to pertain to ''Diplodocus'' might instead be those of ''Apatosaurus''. They reassigned multiple skulls to ''Apatosaurus'' based on associated and closely associated vertebrae. Even though they supported Holland, it was noted that ''Apatosaurus'' might have possessed a ''Camarasaurus'' like skull, based on a disarticulated ''Camarasaurus''-like tooth found at the precise site where an ''Apatosaurus'' specimen was found years before.<ref name="mcintosh&berman1975"/> On October 20, 1979, after the publications by McIntosh and Berman, the first true skull of ''Apatosaurus'' was mounted on a skeleton in a museum, that of the Carnegie.<ref name="parsons"/> The Felch Quarry skull that Marsh included in his 1896 skeletal restoration was suggested to belong to ''[[Brachiosaurus]]'' sp. instead in 1998.<ref name="carpenter98"/> In 2011, a unique ''Apatosaurus'' specimen was first described. This specimen, [[Cincinnati Museum Center|CMC]] VP 7180, was the first specimen of ''Apatosaurus'' where a skull was found articulated with its cervical vertebrae. The specimen was found to differ in both cranial and cervical features from ''A. louisae'', and a majority of features found a relationship with ''A. ajax''.<ref name="barrettetal11"/>

[[File:Apatosaurus Clean.png|thumb|Cast of ''A. parvus'' specimen UWGM 15556]] 
Multiple species of ''Apatosaurus'' and its synonyms have been designated from scant material. Marsh named as many species as he could, which resulted in many being based upon fragmentary and indistinguishable remains. In 2005, Paul Upchurch and colleagues authored a study published to analyze the species and specimen relationships of ''Apatosaurus''.<ref name="Upchurch05"/>

* ''Apatosaurus ajax'' was named by Marsh in 1877 after [[Ajax (mythology)|Ajax]], the [[hero]] from [[Greek mythology]].<ref name="carpenter&currie92"/> Marsh designated the fairly complete skeleton YPM 1860 as its [[holotype]]. The species remained largely unknown as it was overshadowed by ''A. excelsus'' and ''A. louisae''. In 2005, many specimens in addition to the holotype were found assignable to ''A. ajax'', YPM 1840, NSMT-PV 20375, YPM 1861, and AMNH 460. The specimens span from the late [[Kimmeridgian]] to the early [[Tithonian]]. ''A. ajax'' is senior synonym of ''Atlantosaurus immanis'' and ''Apatosaurus laticoliis''.<ref name="Upchurch05"/>

* ''Apatosaurus excelsus'' was first named by Marsh in 1890 under the genus ''Brontosaurus''. Many specimens, including the [[holotype]] YPM 1980, have been assigned to the species. They include FMNH P25112, UWGM 15556, and CMNH 566. In a 2005 revision of ''Apatosaurus'', the Field Museum specimen was found to represent an intermediate species, and the University of Wyoming and Carnegie Museum specimens were reassigned to ''A. parvus''. ''Apatosaurus amplus'', occasionally assigned to ''A. parvus'', is a junior synonym of ''A. excelsus''. ''A. excelsus'' as of yet only includes its type specimen and the type specimen of ''A. amplus''.<ref name="Upchurch05"/>

* ''Apatosaurus louisae'' was named by Holland in 1916 in honor of Mrs. Louise Carnegie, wife of [[Andrew Carnegie]] who funded field research to find complete dinosaur skeletons in the American West. ''Apatosaurus louisae'' was first known from one partial skeleton which was found in [[Utah]] in the United States.<ref name="CM94"/> The holotype is CMNH 3018, with referred specimens including CMNH 3378, CMNH 11162, and LACM 52844. The former two a vertebral column, the latter two a skull and a nearly complete skeleton, respectively. ''A. louisae'' is one of the most distinct species, yet it was recovered as the most primitive species in the Upchurch phylogeny. Its specimens all come from the late Kimmeridgian of [[Dinosaur National Monument]].<ref name="Upchurch05"/>

* ''Apatosaurus parvus'', first described as ''Elosaurus'' in 1902 by Peterson and Gilmore, was reassigned to ''Apatosaurus'' in 1994, with the synonymy being upheld in 2005. The specimens include the [[holotype]], CMNH 566, a partial skeleton of a possible juvenile, the scapula OMNH 1300, and the postcranial skeleton UWGM 155656, the latter two previously considered ''A. excelsus''. It is the oldest species in the genus, from the middle Kimmeridgian.<ref name="Upchurch05"/>

The 2005 paper by Upchurch and colleagues on the species-level taxonomy of ''Apatosaurus'' contained a cladogram of 11 specimens of ''Apatosaurus'' finding many referable to ''A. ajax'' and few to ''A. parvus'', ''A. excelsus'', and ''A. louisae''.

* ''Apatosaurus grandis'' was named in 1877 by Marsh in the article that described ''A. ajax''. It was briefly described, figured, and diagnosed.<ref name="gilmore36"/> Marsh noted that it was only provisionally assigned to the genus when he reassigned it to his new genus ''Morosaurus'' in 1878.<ref name="marsh1878"/> It is now the oldest species of ''Camarasaurus'', after being reassigned to that genus.<ref name="foster-2007"/>

* ''Apatosaurus minimus'' was described originally as a specimen of ''Brontosaurus'' sp. in 1904 by Osborn. In 1917, it was named as its own species, ''A. minimus'' by Henry Mook for a pair of ilia and their sacrum.<ref name="gilmore36"/><ref name="taylor2012"/><ref name="taylor&wedel2012"/> In 2012, [[Mike P. Taylor]] and [[Matt J. Wedel]] published a short abstract describing the material of "A." ''minimus'', finding it to be hard to place among either Diplodocoidea or Macronaria. While it was placed with ''[[Saltasaurus]]'' in a phylogenetic analysis, it was thought to represent instead some form with convergent features from many groups.<ref name="taylor&wedel2012"/>

* ''Apatosaurus alenquerensis'' was named in 1957 by [[Albert-F<U+00E9>lix de Lapparent]] and Georges Zbyweski. It was based on postcrania from Portugal. In 1990 this was referred to ''Camarasaurus'', but in 1998 it was given its own genus, ''[[Lourinhasaurus]]''.<ref name="Upchurch05"/>

* ''Apatosaurus yahnahpin'' was named by James Filla and Patrick Redman in 1994. Bakker made ''A. yahnahpin'' the [[holotype|type]] species of a new genus, ''[[Eobrontosaurus]]'' in 1998,<ref name="Bakker98"/> so it is now properly ''Eobrontosaurus yahnahpin''. One partial skeleton has been found in Wyoming. It has been argued that ''Eobrontosaurus'' belongs within ''Camarasaurus'',<ref name="Upchurch05"/><ref name="Dinosauria04"/> although this has been disputed.<ref name="Holtz2008"/><ref name="SH05"/>

==Palaeobiology==
[[File:Apatosaurus33.jpg|thumb|Artistic interpretation of an individual of ''A. louisae'' arching its neck down to drink]]
It was historically believed that sauropods like ''Apatosaurus'' were too massive to support their own weight on dry land, so it was theorized that they must have lived partly submerged in water, perhaps in swamps. Recent findings do not support this, and sauropods are thought to have been fully terrestrial animals.<ref name="Pierson"/>

===Feeding===
[[File:Apatosaurus Einstein.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Skull of "Einstein" (BYU 17096), showing broad snout]]
A study of diplodocid snouts showed that the square snout, large proportion of pits, and fine subparallel scratches in ''Apatosaurus'' suggests it was a ground-height nonselective browser.<ref name="whitlock11"/> It may have eaten [[fern]]s, [[cycadeoid]]s, [[seed fern]]s, [[horsetail]]s, and algae. Kent Stevens and Michael Parrish (1999 and 2005) suggest that ''Apatosaurus'' had a great feeding range as its neck could bend into a U-shape laterally.<ref name="StevensParrish99"/> The neck's range of movement would have also allowed the head to graze below the level of the body, leading some scientists to speculate on whether these sauropods grazed on submerged water plants, from riverbanks.<ref name="stevens05"/>

Matthew Cobley ''et al.'' (2013) disputed this, finding that large muscles and cartilage would have limited neck movements. They state that the feeding ranges for sauropods like ''Diplodocus'' were smaller than previously believed and the animals may have had to move their whole bodies around to better access areas where they could browse vegetation. As such, they might have spent more time foraging to meet their minimum energy needs.<ref name=Cobley/><ref name="ghose"/> The conclusions of Cobley ''et al.'' were disputed by Taylor, who analysed the amount and positioning of intervertebral cartilage to determine the flexibility of the neck of ''Apatosaurus'' and ''Diplodocus''. He found that the neck of ''Apatosaurus'' was very flexible, and that Cobley '' et al.'' were incorrect in the fact that flexibility as implied by bones is less than in reality.<ref name="taylor14"/>

James Farlow calculated in 1987, that an ''Apatosaurus'' sized dinosaur about {{convert|35|t|LT ST|abbr=on}} would have possessed {{convert|5.7|t|LT ST|abbr=on}} of fermentation contents.<ref name="farlow87"/> Assuming Apatosaurus had an avian respiratory system and a reptilian resting-metabolism, Frank Paladino ''et al.'' (1997) estimate that the animal would need to consume only about 262 liters (69 gallons) of water per day.<ref name="paladinoetal1997"/>

===Posture and locomotion===
{{further2|[[Sauropod neck posture]]}}
[[File:Infant Apatosaurus dinosaur tracks.jpg|thumb|Tracks of a juvenile, indicating bipedal posture]] 
Diplodocids, like ''Apatosaurus'', are often portrayed with their necks held high up in the air, allowing them to browse on tall trees. Some studies suggest that diplodocid necks were less flexible than previously believed, because the structure of the neck vertebrae would not have permitted the neck to bend far upwards, and that sauropods like ''Apatosaurus'' were adapted to low browsing or ground feeding.<ref name="StevensParrish99"/><ref name="stevens05"/><ref name="Upchurch2000"/> Other studies by Taylor find that all [[tetrapod]]s appear to hold their necks at the maximum possible vertical extension when in a normal, alert posture, and argued that the same would hold true for sauropods barring any unknown, unique characteristics that set the soft tissue anatomy of their necks apart from that of other animals. ''Apatosaurus'', like ''Diplodocus'', would have held its neck angled upward with the head pointed downwards in a resting posture.<ref name="taylor14"/><ref name="taylor09"/>

In 2008, footprints of a juvenile ''Apatosaurus'' were reported from Quarry Five in Morrison, Colorado. Discovered in 2006 by Matthew Mossbrucker, these footprints show that juveniles could run on their hind legs in a manner similar to that of the modern [[Basiliscus (genus)|basilisk]] lizard.<ref name="smithsonian08"/> Trackways of ''Apatosaurus'' and other sauropods show that they walked an average of {{convert|30|-|40|km|mile|abbr=on}} per day. A study found that they might have been able to walk {{convert|20|-|30|km|mile|abbr=on}} per hour.<ref name="fastovsky"/> The slow locomotion of sauropods may be due to the minimal muscling or recoil after strides.<ref name="sellers12"/>

Various uses have been proposed for the single claw on the forelimb of sauropods. It has been suggested that they were for defence, but the shape and size of them makes this unlikely. Other predictions were that it could be for feeding, but the most probable is that the claw was for grasping objects like tree trunks when rearing.<ref name="upchurchmanus"/>

===Physiology===
{{further2|[[Physiology of dinosaurs]]}}
[[File:Apatosaurus caudal vertebrae.png|thumb|Tail vertebrae of specimen FMNH P25112, showing pneumatic fossae (holes)]] 
Given the large body mass of ''Apatosaurus'', combined with its long neck, [[physiologist]]s have encountered problems determining how these animals managed to breathe. Beginning with the assumption that ''Apatosaurus'', like [[crocodilia]]ns, did not have a diaphragm, the [[dead space (physiology)|dead-space volume]] (the amount of unused air remaining in the mouth, trachea and air tubes after each breath) has been estimated at about {{convert|184|l|m3|disp=flip|abbr=on}} for a {{convert|30|t|LT ST|abbr=on}} specimen. Its [[Lung volumes|tidal volume]] (the amount of air moved in or out during a single breath) has been calculated by Paladino to be {{convert|904|l|m3|disp=flip|abbr=on}} with an avian [[respiratory]] system, {{convert|225|l|m3|disp=flip|abbr=on}} if mammalian and {{convert|19|l|m3|disp=flip|abbr=on}} if reptilian.<ref name="paladinoetal1997"/>

On this basis, its respiratory system would likely have been [[parabronchi]], with multiple pulmonary air sacs like in [[avian lungs]] and a flow-through lung. Furthermore, an avian system would need a lung volume of only about {{convert|600|l|m3|disp=flip|abbr=on}} compared to a mammalian requirement of {{convert|2,950|l|m3|disp=flip|abbr=on}}, which would exceed the available space. The overall thoracic volume of ''Apatosaurus'' has been estimated at {{convert|1,700|l|m3|disp=flip|abbr=on}} allowing for a {{convert|500|l|m3|disp=flip|abbr=on}}, four-chambered [[heart]] and a {{convert|900|l|m3|disp=flip|abbr=on}} lung capacity. That would allow about {{convert|300|l|m3|disp=flip|abbr=on}} for the necessary [[Biological tissue|tissue]].<ref name="paladinoetal1997"/> Evidence for the avian system in ''Apatosaurus'' and other sauropods is also in the [[Skeletal pneumaticity|pneumaticity]] of the vertebrae. Though this plays a role in reducing the weight of the animal, Wedel (2003) states that they also likely connected to air sacs as in birds.<ref name="Wedel 2003"/>

James Spotila ''et al.'' (1991) suggest that the large body size of ''Apatosaurus'' and other sauropods would have made them unable to maintain high metabolic rates as they would not be able to release enough heat.<ref name="spotila91"/> They assumed that the animals had a reptilian respiratory system. Wedel found that an avian system would have allowed then to dump more heat.<ref name="Wedel 2003"/> Some scientists have argued that the heart would have had trouble sustaining sufficient blood pressure to oxygenate the brain.<ref name="Pierson"/> Others argue that the near horizontal posture of the head and neck would have eliminated the problem of supplying blood to the brain, as it would not be elevated.<ref name="StevensParrish99"/>

===Growth===
[[File:Baby Apatosaurus OMNH.jpg|thumb|left|Juvenile ''A.'' sp. mount, Sam Noble Oklahoma Museum of Natural History]]
A 1999 microscopic study of ''Apatosaurus'' bones concluded that the animals grew rapidly when young and reached near-adult sizes in about 10 years.<ref name=Curry99/> In 2008, a study on the growth rates for sauropods was published, authored by Thomas Lehman and Holly Woodward. They found that by using growth lines and length to mass, ''Apatosaurus'' would have attained a mass of {{convert|25|t|LT ST|abbr=on}} in 15 years. This would imply sauropods had a growth rate of {{convert|5000|kg|lb|abbr=on}} per year. An alternative method, using limb length and body mass, found ''Apatosaurus'' to stop growing at 70 years of age, growing {{convert|520|kg|lb|abbr=on}} per year.<ref name="lehman&woodward"/> These estimates have been suggested to be unreliable as the methods producing them are not sound as old growth lines would have been obliterated due to bone remodelling.<ref name="griebeler"/> One of the first identified growth factors of ''Apatosaurus'' was the number of sacral vertebrae, which increased to five by maturity. This was first noted in 1903, and then in 1936.<ref name="gilmore36"/>

Long-bone histology enables researchers to estimate the age that a specific individual reached. A study by Eva Griebeler ''et al.'' (2013) examined long bone histological data and concluded that the ''Apatosaurus'' sp. SMA 0014 weighed {{Convert|20206|kg|ST|1|abbr=on}}, reached sexual maturity at 21 years and died at age 28. The same growth model indicated that ''Apatosaurus'' sp. BYU 601<U+2013>17328 weighed {{Convert|18178|kg|ST|1|abbr=on}}, reached sexual maturity at 19 years and died at age 31.<ref name="griebeler"/>

===Tail===
An article that appeared in the November 1997 issue of ''[[Discover Magazine]]'' reported research into the mechanics of ''Apatosaurus'' tails by [[Nathan Myhrvold]], a [[computer scientist]] from [[Microsoft]]. Myhrvold carried out a [[computer simulation]] of the tail, which in diplodocids like ''Apatosaurus'' was a very long, tapering structure resembling a [[bullwhip]]. This computer modeling suggested that sauropods were capable of producing a whip-like cracking sound of over 200 [[decibel]]s, comparable to the volume of a [[cannon]].<ref name="zimmer1997"/>

A [[pathology]] has also been identified on the tail of ''Apatosaurus'', due to a growth defect. Two caudal vertebrae are seamlessly fused along the entire articulating surface of the bone, including the arches of the neural spines. This defect might have been caused due to the lack or inhibition of the substance that forms intervertebral disks or joints.<ref name="lovelace14"/>

==Paleoecology==
[[File:Dinosaur National Monument quarry map.png|thumb|left|400px|Map of the fossils of [[Dinosaur National Monument]]]]
The [[Morrison Formation]] is a sequence of shallow marine and alluvial sediments which, according to [[radiometric dating]], ranges between 156.3 million years old ([[Mega-annum|Ma]]) at its base,<ref name=TCR06/> to 146.8 million years old at the top,<ref name=SAB98/> which places it in the late [[Oxfordian stage|Oxfordian]], [[Kimmeridgian]], and early [[Tithonian]] [[faunal stages|stages]] of the Late Jurassic period. This formation is interpreted as a [[semiarid]] environment with distinct [[wet season|wet]] and [[dry season]]s. The Morrison Basin where dinosaurs lived, stretched from New Mexico to Alberta and Saskatchewan, and was formed when the precursors to the [[Front Range]] of the Rocky Mountains started pushing up to the west. The deposits from their east-facing [[drainage basin]]s were carried by streams and [[river]]s and deposited in [[swamp]]y lowlands, lakes, river channels and [[floodplain]]s.<ref name=DAR89/> This formation is similar in age to the [[Lourinha Formation]] in [[Portugal]] and the [[Tendaguru Formation]] in [[Tanzania]].<ref name=OM06/>
[[File:Clash of Titans Saurophaganax and Apatosaurus.jpg|thumb|upright|''Saurophaganax'' and ''A.'' sp., Sam Noble Oklahoma Museum of Natural History]]
''Apatosaurus'' was the second most common sauropod in the Morrison Formation ecosystem, after ''Camarasaurus''.<ref name="foster-2007"/> It may have been a more solitary animal than other Morrison Formation dinosaurs.<ref name=DBBM80/> ''Supersaurus'' has a greater total length and thus the greatest of all sauropods from the Morrison.<ref name=LHW07/> As a genus, ''Apatosaurus'' existed for a long span of time, and have been found in most levels of the Morrison. Fossils of ''Apatosaurus ajax'' are known exclusively from the upper portion of the formation (upper [[Brushy Basin Member]]), about 152<U+2013>151 million years ago. ''A. excelsus'' fossils have been reported from the upper [[Salt Wash Member]] to the upper Brushy Basin Member, ranging from the middle to late Kimmeridgian age, about 154<U+2013>151 million years ago. ''A. louisae'' fossils are rare, known only from one site in the upper Brushy Basin Member, dated to the late Kimmeridgian stage (about 151 million years ago). Additional ''Apatosaurus'' remains are known from even younger rocks, but they have not been identified as any particular species.<ref name=turner1999/> Older ''Apatosaurus'' remains have also been identified from the middle Kimmeridgian, and are assigned to ''A. parvus''.<ref name="Upchurch05"/> [[Fossil]]s of these animals have been found in [[Nine Mile Quarry]] and [[Bone Cabin Quarry]] in Wyoming and at sites in [[Colorado]], [[Oklahoma]] and [[Utah]], present in stratigraphic zones 2<U+2013>6.<ref name="foster-2007"/>
[[File:Apatosaurus ischium Dinosaur Journey Museum.jpg|thumb|left|Ischium of an ''Apatosaurus'' showing bite marks from a large theropod]]
The Morrison Formation records an environment and time dominated by gigantic sauropod dinosaurs.<ref name="foster-2007"/> Dinosaurs known from the Morrison include the theropods ''[[Ceratosaurus]]'', ''[[Ornitholestes]]'', and ''[[Torvosaurus]]'', the sauropods ''Apatosaurus'', ''Brachiosaurus'', ''Camarasaurus'', and ''Diplodocus'', and the [[ornithischia]]ns ''[[Camptosaurus]]'', ''[[Dryosaurus]]'', and ''[[Stegosaurus]]''.<ref name=DJCetal06/> ''Apatosaurus'' is commonly found at the same sites as ''Allosaurus'', ''Camarasaurus'', ''Diplodocus'', and ''Stegosaurus''.<ref name=DBBM80/> ''[[Allosaurus]]'', which accounting for 70 to 75% of theropod specimens and was at the top [[trophic level]] of the Morrison [[food chain|food web]].<ref name=JRF03a/> Many of the dinosaurs of the Morrison Formation are the same genera as those seen in Portuguese rocks of the Lourinha Formation (mainly ''Allosaurus'', ''Ceratosaurus'', ''Torvosaurus'', and ''Apatosaurus''), or have a close counterpart (''Brachiosaurus'' and ''[[Lusotitan]]'', ''Camptosaurus'' and ''[[Draconyx]]'').<ref name=OM06/> Other vertebrates that shared this paleoenvironment included [[actinopterygii|ray-finned fishes]], [[frog]]s, [[salamander]]s, [[turtle]]s, [[sphenodontia|sphenodonts]], [[lizard]]s, terrestrial and aquatic [[crocodylomorpha]]ns, and several species of [[pterosaur]]. Shells of [[bivalve]]s and aquatic [[snail]]s are also common. The flora of the period has been revealed by fossils of [[chlorophyta|green algae]], [[fungi]], [[moss]]es, [[equisetum|horsetails]], [[cycad]]s, [[ginkgo]]es, and several families of [[conifer]]s. Vegetation varied from river-lining forests of [[tree fern]]s, and [[fern]]s ([[gallery forest]]s), to fern [[savanna]]s with occasional trees such as the ''[[Araucaria]]''-like conifer ''[[Brachyphyllum]]''.<ref name=KC06/>

==In popular culture==
[[File:Pasta-Brontosaurus.jpg|thumb|right|Outdated 1897 restoration by [[Charles R. Knight]] of ''A. excelsus'' submerged in water, and ''Diplodocus'' dragging its tail]]
The length of time taken for Marsh's misclassification to be brought to public notice meant that the name ''Brontosaurus'', associated as it was with one of the largest dinosaurs, became so famous that it persisted long after the name had officially been abandoned in scientific use.<ref name="gould1991"/>

''Apatosaurus'' have often been depicted in cinema, beginning with [[Winsor McCay]]'s 1914 classic ''[[Gertie the Dinosaur]]'', one of the first animated films.<ref name="crafton82"/> McCay based his unidentified dinosaur on the ''Brontosaurus'' skeleton in the American Museum of Natural History.<ref name=dinoparade/> The 1925 silent film ''[[The Lost World (1925 film)|The Lost World]]'' featured a battle between a ''Brontosaurus'' and an ''Allosaurus'', using [[special effect]]s by [[Willis O'Brien]].<ref name="glut97"/> These, and other early uses of the animal as major representative of the group, helped cement ''Brontosaurus'' as a quintessential dinosaur in the public consciousness.<ref name="gould1991"/>

[[Sinclair Oil Corporation]] has long been a fixture of American roads (and briefly in other countries) with its green dinosaur logo and mascot, an ''Apatosaurus'' (''Brontosaurus''). While Sinclair's early advertising included a number of different dinosaurs, eventually only ''Apatosaurus'' was used as the official logo, due to its popular appeal.<ref name=sinclairoil/>

As late as 1989, the [[United States Postal Service|U.S. Post Office]] caused controversy when it issued four "dinosaur" stamps: ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'', ''Stegosaurus'', ''[[Pteranodon]]'' and ''Brontosaurus''. The use of the term ''Brontosaurus'' in place of ''Apatosaurus'', as well as the fact that ''Pteranodon''s were technically pterosaurs and not dinosaurs, led to complaints of "fostering scientific illiteracy."<ref name="NYT"/> The Post Office defended itself (in Postal Bulletin 21744) by saying, "Although now recognized by the scientific community as ''Apatosaurus'', the name 'Brontosaurus' was used for the stamp because it is more familiar to the general population." [[Stephen Jay Gould]] also supported this position in his essay "[[Bully for Brontosaurus]]", though he echoed Riggs's original argument that ''Brontosaurus'' is a synonym for ''Apatosaurus''. Nevertheless, he noted that the former has developed and continues to maintain an independent existence in the popular imagination.<ref name="gould1991"/>
