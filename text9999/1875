'''''Gate to the Northwest Passage''''' is a 1980 sculpture by [[Alan Chung Hung]], located adjacent to the [[Vancouver Maritime Museum]] in [[Vanier Park]] in the [[Kitsilano]] neighborhood of [[Vancouver]], British Columbia, Canada.<ref name=Registry>{{Cite web|url=https://app.vancouver.ca/PublicArt_Net/ArtworkDetails.aspx?ArtworkID=110|title=Gate to the Northwest Passage|accessdate=July 10, 2013|publisher=City of Vancouver Public Art Registry}}</ref> The {{Convert|4.6|m|adj=on}} sculpture of a square, cut and twisted "like a paper clip" to form an arch, is composed of weathered [[Weathering steel|Corten steel]] that rusts to provide a protective layer. The work was installed in 1980 to commemorate the arrival of Captain [[George Vancouver]] in [[Burrard Inlet]], following a competition sponsored by [[Parks Canada]] one year prior. ''Gate to the Northwest Passage'' received an adverse reaction initially, but reception has improved over time. The sculpture has been included in walking tours of the surrounding neighborhoods as a highlight of Vanier Park.

''Gate to the Northwest Passage'' was designed by [[Alan Chung Hung]] (1946<U+2013>1994), who was born in Canton, China, moved to Vancouver in 1969, and studied at the [[Emily Carr University of Art and Design|Vancouver School of Art]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://app.vancouver.ca/PublicArt_net/ArtistDetails.aspx?ArtistID=45|title=Alan Chung Hung|accessdate=July 12, 2013|publisher=City of Vancouver Public Art Registry}}</ref> In 1979, [[Parks Canada]] sponsored a competition for a permanent work to commemorate Captain [[George Vancouver]], the first European to enter [[Burrard Inlet]], in 1792.<ref name=Angels>{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=plR5pDPofSIC&pg=PA53|title=Public Art in Vancouver: Angels Among Lions|accessdate=July 11, 2013|page=53|first1=John|last1=Steil|first2=Aileen|last2=Stalker|year=2009|publisher=TouchWood Editions}}</ref> Guidelines for the competition required the use of permanent materials other than wood and that the work should "not be in the likeness of a man".<ref name=Registry/> [[Hugh Faulkner]], [[Minister of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development|Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development]] during 1977<U+2013>1979, offered the opportunity for the sculpture, and the project was recommended by the [[National Historic Sites of Canada|Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada]].<ref name=Registry/> ''Gate to the Northwest Passage'' was selected by a five-person jury, led by former parks superintendent Stuart Lefeaux, then confirmed by the Parks Board.<ref name=Registry/> The work was originally to be installed at [[Stanley Park]]'s Ferguson Point, but was sited in [[Vanier Park]] adjacent to the [[Vancouver Maritime Museum]] in 1980.<ref name=Registry/> Chung Hung's other works displayed in Vancouver include ''Spring'' (1981) and ''Clouds'' (1991).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://app.vancouver.ca/PublicArt_net/ArtworkDetails.aspx?ArtworkID=78|title=Spring|accessdate=July 12, 2013|publisher=City of Vancouver Public Art Registry}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://app.vancouver.ca/PublicArt_net/ArtworkDetails.aspx?ArtworkID=113|title=Clouds|accessdate=July 12, 2013|publisher=City of Vancouver Public Art Registry}}</ref>

==Reception==

According to the City of Vancouver Public Art Registry, ''Gate to the Northwest Passage'' initially received an adverse reaction from local residents.<ref name=Registry/> Michael Duncan, then chief curator of the [[Vancouver Maritime Museum]], called it "a bloody monstrosity".<ref name=Registry/> One member of the five-person jury responded to the criticism: "If people think Hung's sculpture is a poor catch, they should have seen the ones that got away."<ref name=Registry/>

A 1983 article published in ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' referred to the sculpture as the "world's largest paper clip".<ref name=Registry/> The same article included a statement from the city planning study: "Vancouver's peerless natural setting is a permanent gift from nature. So massive and close are the North Shore mountains that no amount of human folly can ever obliterate them."<ref name=Registry/>

Reception of the work, which has become a familiar landmark, has improved over time.<ref name=Registry/> One travel guide by [[Eyewitness Books]] referred to ''Gate to the Northwest Passage'' as an "imposing giant red steel" sculpture.<ref>{{cite book|last=Carmin|first=Anita|title=DK Eyewitness Travel Guide: Pacific Northwest|date=October 1, 2012|publisher=Penguin|pages=220|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=8nuVTblfzNcC&pg=PA220&lpg=PA220&dq#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=March 5, 2014}}</ref> [[Frommer's]] includes  the sculpture in walking tours for Vancouver as a highlight of Vanier Park.<ref name=Hannafin/><ref>Frommer's:
