The '''Kleine Renne''' is a cascading mountain stream and officially designated [[natural monument]] near the town of [[Wernigerode]] in the [[Harz Mountains]] of Germany.

== Location ==
The Kleine Renne is located west of the village of [[Hasserode]] in the borough of Wernigerode in a forest at the foot of the  [[Brocken]], the highest mountain in the Harz. It is a left tributary of the River [[Holtemme]] below the [[Steinerne Renne]]. The water flows here over countless little waterfalls over numerous boulders and [[granite]] rocks down to the valley of the  Holtemme. A signed footpath, which was re-opened in the early 1990s, runs steeply uphill in the valley of the Kleine Renne and meets the old road at the forest in of ''[[Steinerne Renne]]''.
