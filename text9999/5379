== Early life and education ==
Born and raised in [[Ashiya, Hyogo]], a wealthy [[Kobe]] suburb, Koike went to [[K<U+014D>nan Girls' Junior and Senior High School]] for her secondary education.

Her father, Y<U+016B>jir<U+014D> Koike, was a foreign trade merchant who handled oil products. He was also involved in politics, supporting [[Shintar<U+014D> Ishihara]] and the [[Tatenokai]] in 1960s, and ran for a [[Japanese general election, 1969|national election]] to no avail in 1969.<ref name=asahi20080824>"Oyaji no Senaka", ''[[Asahi Shimbun]] Morning Edition'', August 24, 2008</ref> He occasionally told Yuriko his opinion that it was essential for Japan to strengthen relations with [[Arab]] countries in order to ensure a stable [[petroleum]] supply lest the resource-poor Japan be thrust into war for oil again. His word encouraged her to decide to study in [[Egypt]] to master [[Arabic language|Arabic]].<ref name=asahi20080824 /><ref name=josei>"Kikase te Anata no Mottainai", ''[[Sh<U+016B>kan Josei]]'', [[Shufu-to-Seikatsusha]], September 12, 2006</ref>

After attending the School of Sociology at [[Kwansei Gakuin University]] in 1971 and the [[American University in Cairo]] in 1972, Koike received a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in [[Sociology]] from [[Cairo University]] in 1976. She married a Japanese student in Egypt when she was 21 years old, but divorced soon after.<ref>[[Masaharu Fujiyoshi]], "Koike Yuriko Kenky<U+016B>", ''[[Sh<U+016B>kan Bunshun]]'', [[Bungeishunj<U+016B>]], October 20, 2005</ref><ref>"Koike Yuriko F<U+016B>in no Nij<U+016B>issai", ''[[Flash (magazine)|Flash]]'', vol. 1020, [[Kobunsha]], September 2008</ref>

== Career in media ==
Koike anchored [[TV Tokyo]]'s ''[[World Business Satellite]]'', the nation-wide TV business news program from 1988 to 1992, after co-hosting [[Kenichi Takemura]]'s {{nihongo|''Storytelling on Social Aspects''|<U+4E16><U+76F8><U+8B1B><U+8AC7>|Ses<U+014D> k<U+014D>dan}} of [[Nippon Television|NTV]] from 1979 to 1985.

Koike currently belongs to the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]] after she belonged to the [[Japan New Party]], [[New Frontier Party]], [[Liberal Party (Japan)|Liberal Party]], and [[New Conservative Party]]. She has also served one term in the [[House of Councillors]]. She is one of the five Vice Secretaries General of the Diet Members' Committee of {{nihongo|Japan Conference|[[:ja:<U+65E5><U+672C><U+4F1A><U+8B70>|<U+65E5><U+672C><U+4F1A><U+8B70>]]|Nippon Kaigi}}, the country's largest conservative [[think tank]], once chaired by [[Taro Aso]].

A past participant in the [[World Economic Forum]], Koike has been considered a prime candidate to become Japan's first female prime minister. Koike is a long-time participant in the U.S.-Japan Legislative Exchange Program hosted by [[George Washington University]] and run by Professor Henry Nau. 

She previously served as the [[Ministry of the Environment (Japan)|Minister of the Environment]] and Minister of State for [[Okinawa]] and Northern Territories Affairs in the Cabinet of [[Junichiro Koizumi]], Abe's predecessor. She has been responsible for starting the [[Cool Biz campaign]] in Japanese political circles.

Originally representing [[Hy<U+014D>go Prefecture]], Koike became one of Koizumi's "assassins" in the [[Japanese general election, 2005|2005 Lower House election]], and was critical of LDP members who were defiant of Koizumi's leadership. Her most recent position before becoming Minister of Defense was [[Special Advisor to the Prime Minister for National Security Issues]] in the Abe Cabinet.

Koike announced on August 24, 2007 that she intended to resign from the post, citing the Aegis classified information leak scandal as a reason.<ref name=japannewsreview1756/> Koike later hinted that the much publicized fight she had had with [[Chief Cabinet Secretary]] [[Yasuhisa Shiozaki]] over a vice-minister replacement was the real reason, as the opposition would use that to oppose a bill on Japan's terrorism laws.<ref>[http://www.japannewsreview.com/politics/politics/20070825page_id=1759 Resigning Koike criticizes opposition] - Japan News Review</ref>

=== 2008 LDP leadership election ===
On September 8, 2008, Koike launched her bid to become President of the LDP and became the [[List of the first female holders of political offices in Asia|first woman]] ever to seek the premiership in Japan's history: "I have received the enthusiastic support of my colleagues. In order to break through the deadlock facing Japanese society, I believe the country might as well have a female candidate. [[Hillary Rodham Clinton|Hillary]] used the word 'glass ceiling' ... but in Japan, it isn't glass, it's an iron plate. I'm not [[Margaret Thatcher|Mrs Thatcher]], but what is needed is a strategy that advances a cause with conviction, clear policies and sympathy with the people."<ref>[http://www.reuters.com/article/vcCandidateFeed1/idUSL769448120080908 reuters.com, Japan PM contender sees "iron" barrier for women]</ref>

In [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan) leadership election, 2008|the leadership election]], held on September 22, [[Taro Aso]] won with 351 of the 527 votes; Koike placed third with 46 votes.<ref>[http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/national/20080922dy04.htm "Aso elected LDP head"], ''The Yomiuri Shimbun'', 22 September 2008.</ref>

=== Political positions ===
Koike supports for [[economic liberalism]], promotes administrative and budgetary reform, and insists on further advancement of the status of women in the working world. Her motto is "Check, Challenge, Change, Creative and Communication."<ref>"[http://www.yuriko.or.jp/kihon/kihon.shtml Koike Yuriko Kihon Rinen]", Koike Yuriko Official Website (in Japanese)</ref>

Having learned ecological lifestyle from her own experience of wartime austerities in Egypt,<ref name=josei /> Koike actively addresses environmental issues. She received the [[Japan Jewelry Best Dresser Award]] for her success in the [[Cool Biz campaign|Cool Biz and Warm Biz campaign]]. She expressed the idea of introducing [[carbon tax]] in 2005 so that Japan might achieve the goals of the [[Kyoto Protocol]],<ref>"[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20051106f1.html Koike pledges to push carbon tax to meet goals under Kyoto Protocol]", ''[[The Japan Times]]'', November 6, 2005</ref> but her idea has not been realized yet. In 2006, she started the "[[Mottainai]] Furoshiki" campaign, which urges shoppers to use [[furoshiki]] in place of [[plastic shopping bag]]s.<ref>"[http://www.env.go.jp/en/focus/060403.html Minister Koike created the 'Mottainai Furoshiki']", Ministry of the Environment</ref> She is against the use of [[biofuel]]s made from food crops.<ref>''[[Mainichi Shimbun]] Morning Edition'', March 11, 2008</ref> Her hope is that Japan will be a society where citizens and companies can make profits by contributing to the protection of the environment, for example through [[emissions trading]].<ref>''Diamond Zai'', p. 80, [[Diamond (publisher)|Diamond]], September 2007</ref>

As a conservative nationalist, Koike belongs to the Diet members' league to support the [[Japanese Society for History Textbook Reform]].<ref>"[http://www.chosunonline.com/article/20060927000035 Uha no Sokkin de Katamerareta Abe Seiken]", ''[[The Chosun Ilbo]]'', September 27, 2006 (in Japanese)</ref><ref name=akahata>"[http://www.jcp.or.jp/akahata/aik4/2006-10-06/2006100603_01_0.html 'Yasukuni Shikan' Kataru Menmen]", ''[[Akahata]]'', October 6, 2006 (in Japanese)</ref> She is also a member of the Diet members' group to promote [[Yasukuni Shrine]] visits, led by [[Yoshinobu Shimamura]], and goes to worship the war dead at the shrine on [[Victory over Japan Day|War-End Day]], August 15, almost every year.<ref name=akahata /> Not being able to visit it due to an official trip to [[Okinawa Prefecture|Okinawa]], she sent her proxy to worship at the shrine in 2007.<ref>"[http://www.mod.go.jp/m/i/kisha/2007/08/07.html Koike Daijin Kaiken Gaiy<U+014D>]", August 7, 2007 (in Japanese)</ref><ref>"[http://www.kinyobi.co.jp/MiscPages/yasukuni_list2007/document_view Yasukuni Sampaisha List 2007]", [[Sh<U+016B>kan Kin'y<U+014D>bi]] (in Japanese)</ref> She insists on developing an environment to encourage the [[Emperor of Japan|emperor]] to visit Yasukuni.<ref>"[http://headlines.yahoo.co.jp/hl?a=20080915-00000924-san-pol S<U+014D>saisen Yasukuni demo Zessen]", ''[[Sankei Shimbun]]'', September 15, 2008 (in Japanese)</ref>
