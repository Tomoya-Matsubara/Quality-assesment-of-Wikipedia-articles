'''SM ''U-29''''' or '''''U-XXIX''''' was a [[U-27 class submarine (Austria-Hungary)|''U-27'' class]] [[U-boat]] or [[submarine]] for the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]]. ''U-29'', built by the Hungarian firm of [[Ganz Danubius]] at [[Fiume]], was [[launch (ship)|launch]]ed in October 1916 and [[commission (ship)|commission]]ed in January 1917.

''U-29'' had a single [[submarine hull|hull]] and was just over {{convert|121|ft|m}} in length. She [[displacement (ship)|displaced]] nearly {{convert|265|MT|LT|0}} when surfaced and over {{convert|300|MT|LT|0}} when submerged. Her two [[diesel engine]]s moved her at up to {{convert|9|knots|km/h}} on the surface, while her twin [[electric motor]]s propelled her at up to {{convert|7.5|knots|km/h}} while underwater. She was armed with two bow [[torpedo tube]]s and could carry a load of up to four torpedoes. She was also equipped with a {{convert|75|mm|in|1|adj=on|abbr=on}} [[deck gun]] and a [[machine gun]].

During her service career, ''U-29'' sank three ships and damaged two others, sending a combined tonnage of {{GRT|9,838|first=short}} to the bottom. ''U-29'' was at [[Fiume]] at war's end and was surrendered at [[Venice]] in March 1919. She was granted to France as war reparation in 1920, but foundered while under tow to [[Bizerta]] for scrapping.<ref name=Gib-388>Gibson and Prendergast, pp. 388<U+2013>89.</ref>

== Design and construction ==
[[Austria-Hungary]]'s U-boat fleet was largely obsolete at the outbreak of [[World War I]].<ref name=Con-341>Gardiner, p. 341.</ref> The [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] satisfied its most urgent needs by purchasing five [[German Type UB I submarine|Type UB I]] submarines that comprised the {{sclass|U-10|submarine|4}} from Germany,<ref name=Con-343>Gardiner, p. 343.</ref> by raising and recommissioning the sunken French submarine [[French submarine Curie (Q 87)|''Curie'']] as {{SMS|U-14|Austria-Hungary|2|sub=y}},<ref name=Con-341 /><ref group=Note>[[French submarine Curie (Q 87)|''Curie'']] had been caught in an [[anti-submarine net]] while trying to enter the harbor at [[Pula|Pola]] on 20 December 1914. See: Gardiner, p. 343.</ref> and by building four submarines of the {{sclass|U-20|submarine|4}} that were based on the 1911 Danish [[Havmanden class submarine (1911)|''Havmanden'' class]].<ref name=Con-344>Gardiner, p. 344.</ref><ref group=Note>The plans for the Danish [[Havmanden class submarine (1911)|''Havmanden'' class submarines]], three of which were built in Austria-Hungary, were seized from [[Whitehead & Co.]] in [[Fiume]]. See: Gardiner, pp. 344, 354.</ref>

After these steps alleviated their most urgent needs,<ref name=Con-341 /> the Austro-Hungarian Navy selected the [[German Type UB II submarine|German Type UB II]] design for its newest submarines in mid 1915.<ref name=Hal-383>Halpern, p. 383.</ref> The Germans were reluctant to allocate any of their wartime resources to Austro-Hungarian construction, but were willing to sell plans for up to six of the UB II boats to be constructed under license in Austria-Hungary.<ref name=Hal-383 /> The Navy agreed to the proposal and purchased the plans from [[AG Weser]] of [[Bremen]].<ref name=BS>Baumgartner and Sieche, as excerpted [http://www.gwpda.org/naval/ahsubs.htm here] (reprinted and translated into English by Sieche). Retrieved 1 December 2008.</ref>

''U-29'' displaced {{convert|264|MT|LT}} surfaced and {{convert|301|MT|LT}} submerged.<ref name=Con-344 /> She had a single [[submarine hull|hull]] with [[saddle tank]]s,<ref name=Con-181>Gardiner, p. 181.</ref> and was {{convert|121|ft|1|in|m}} long with a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|14|ft|4|in|m}} and a [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|12|ft|2|in|m}}.<ref name=Con-344 /> For propulsion, she had two shafts, twin [[diesel engine]]s of {{convert|270|bhp|abbr=on}} for surface running, and twin [[electric motor]]s of {{convert|280|shp|abbr=on}} for submerged travel. She was capable of {{convert|9|knots|km/h|1}} while surfaced and {{convert|7.5|knots|km/h}} while submerged.<ref name=Con-344 /> Although there is no specific notation of a range for ''U-29'' in ''Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships, 1906<U+2013>1921'', the German UB II boats, upon which the ''U-27'' class was based, had a range of over {{convert|6000|nmi|km}} at {{convert|5|knots|km/h}} surfaced, and {{convert|45|nmi|km}} at {{convert|4|knots|km/h}} submerged.<ref name=Con-181 /> ''U-27''-class boats were designed for a crew of 23<U+2013>24.<ref name=Con-344 />

''U-29'' was armed with two {{convert|45|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} bow [[torpedo tube]]s and could carry a complement of four torpedoes. She was also equipped with a 75<U+00A0>mm/26 (3.0<U+00A0>in) [[deck gun]] and an {{convert|8|mm|in|abbr=on}} [[machine gun]].<ref name=Con-344 />

After intricate political negotiations to allocate production of the class between Austrian and Hungarian firms,<ref name=Hal-383 /> ''U-27'' was ordered from [[Ganz Danubius]] on 12 October 1915.<ref name=Miller-20 /> She was [[keel laying|laid down]] on 3 March 1916 at [[Fiume]] and [[launch (ship)|launch]]ed on 21 October.

== Service career ==
''U-29'' underwent diving trials at Fiume and then made her way to [[Pula|Pola]] on 29 November 1916.<ref name=Tengeral /> There, on 21 January 1917,<ref name=Tengeral /> SM ''U-29'' was [[commission (ship)|commission]]ed into the Austro-Hungarian Navy under the command of ''Linenschiffleutnant'' Leo Pr<U+00E1>sil.<ref name=KUK-U-29 /> Pr<U+00E1>sil, a 29-year-old native of Pola, had previously served as commander of {{SMS|U-10|Austria-Hungary|2|sub=y}}.<ref name=Pr<U+00E1>sil>{{cite web | last = Helgason | first = Gu<U+00F0>mundur | title = WWI U-boat commanders: Leo Pr<U+00E1>sil | url = http://uboat.net/wwi/men/commanders/529.html | work = U-Boat War in World War I | date =  | accessdaymonth = 22 January | accessyear = 2009 }}</ref>

''U-29'' departed on her first patrol on 23 January, destined for duty in the [[Mediterranean]]. The next day , however, the U-boat encountered a severe storm near [[Lussin]] that damaged her. Pr<U+00E1>sil steered the boat into the harbor at [[Brgulje]] to wait out the storm. Departing Brgulje on the 25th to resume her journey to the Mediterranean, the submarine developed a leak when performing a test dive. ''U-29'' headed back to Pola for repairs, which lasted until 30 January. On 5 February the U-boat set out for [[Cattaro]], which she reached after three days journey.<ref name=Tengeral />

Pr<U+00E1>sil took ''U-29'' out of Cattaro on 17 February to begin the delayed patrol in the Mediterranean, but on the 20th encountered another severe storm. Suffering no damage in the tempest, the boat continued on. On 24 February, she had an at-sea rendezvous with {{SMS|U-43|Austria-Hungary|2|sub=y}}. On 1 March the U-boat's [[gyrocompass]] broke down, necessitating a return to port. Two days later, as she neared Cattaro, ''U-29'' encountered yet another storm, this one again damaging the ship. The beleaguered U-boat headed back to the base at Pola for more repairs, and remained there until early April.<ref name=Tengeral />

On 4 April, ''U-29'' set out from Pola, touched at Cattaro, and continued on into the Mediterranean for her second patrol there.<ref name=Tengeral /> While {{convert|25|nmi|km}} from [[Cape Matapan]], Pr<U+00E1>sil torpedoed and sank the steamer ''Dalton'', traveling in [[ballast]]. ''U-29'' took the [[captain (nautical)|master]] of the the 3,486-ton British ship captive; three other men lost their lives in the attack.<ref name=dalton>{{cite web | last = Helgason | first = Gu<U+00F0>mundur | title = Ships hit during WWI: Dalton | url = http://uboat.net/wwi/ships_hit/1554.html | work = U-Boat War in World War I | publisher = Uboat.net | date =  | accessdaymonth = 22 January | accessyear = 2009 }}</ref> Five days later and some {{convert|115|nmi|km}} away, ''U-29'' torpedoed {{SS|Mashobra||2}}, a [[British India Line]] [[ocean liner|passenger steamer]] of {{GRT|8,173|first=yes}}. The ship, en route from [[Calcutta]] to London with a general cargo, was finished off by ''U-29''{{'}}s [[deck gun]]. As with ''Dalton'', ''Mashobra''{{'}}s master was taken prisoner. Eight persons died in the attack.<ref name=mash>{{cite web | last = Helgason | first = Gu<U+00F0>mundur | title = Ships hit during WWI: Mashobra | url = http://uboat.net/wwi/ships_hit/4022.html | work = U-Boat War in World War I | publisher = Uboat.net | date =  | accessdaymonth = 22 January | accessyear = 2009 }}</ref> ''U-29''{{'}}s gyrocompass broke down again on 17 April, once again forcing the boat to return for repairs. ''U-29''{{'}}s second Mediterranean tour ended when Pr<U+00E1>sil docked the boat at Cattaro on 19 April.<ref name=Tengeral />

''U-29''{{'}}s third Mediterranean deployment began on 8 May when she departed Cattaro. After eleven days at sea, Pr<U+00E1>sil torpedoed the British [[cargo ship]] ''Mordenwood'' {{convert|90|nmi|km}} from Cape Matapan.<ref name=morden>{{cite web | last = Helgason | first = Gu<U+00F0>mundur | title = Ships hit during WWI: Mordenwood | url = http://uboat.net/wwi/ships_hit/4245.html | work = U-Boat War in World War I | publisher = Uboat.net | date =  | accessdaymonth = 22 January | accessyear = 2009 }}</ref> ''U-29'' took the 3,125-ton ship's master captive.<ref name=Tenn-51>Tennent, p. 51.</ref> Two sources disagree on the number of casualties when ''Mordenwood'' went down, but place the number at either 21 or 31.<ref>Tennent (p. 51) reports 31 were killed; Helgason reports 21 killed.</ref> Escorting destroyers launched a [[depth charge]] attack on ''U-29'' but did not succeed in damaging the U-boat. Two days later, ''U-29'' launched a torpedo attack on the British steamer ''Marie Suzanne'' but did not sink the ship. ''U-29'' arrived at Cattaro on 25 May.

After a brief time in port, ''U-29'' set out for the Mediterranean again on 17 June. One day out, the U-boat came under attack from an airplane out of [[Valona]], compelling ''U-29'' to [[crash dive]]; none of the three bombs dropped by the aircraft hit their mark. ''U-29''{{'}}s patrol ended without success when she docked at Cattaro on 6 July. After a return to Pola on 12 July, the U-boat underwent extensive repairs that kept her out of action for the next nine months.<ref name=Tengeral />

[[File:HMS Edgar.jpg|thumb|left|{{HMS|Edgar|1890|6}} was torpedoed by ''U-29'' on 4 April 1918 but survived the attack. ''Edgar'' was the only warship topedoed by ''U-29'']]
On 16 March 1918, the newly refitted boat sailed from Pola to Cattaro, departing that port for another Mediterranean tour on 25 March. Near Valona the next day, an Italian destroyer attempted to ram ''U-29'', scraping one of her propellers against ''U-29''{{'}}s [[conning tower]]. The damage done was slight and ''U-29'' continued on into the Mediterranean, weathering a storm in the [[Ionian Sea]] on the 27th. On 4 April, ''U-29'' launched a torpedo attack on what was thought to be a [[cargo ship]].<ref name=Tengeral /> In fact, it was the British protected cruiser {{HMS|Edgar|1890|2}} which had been hit. ''Edgar'' was damaged but did not sink; she suffered no casualties in the attack.<ref name=edgar>{{cite web | last = Helgason | first = Gu<U+00F0>mundur | title = Ships hit during WWI: Edgar (HMS) | url = http://uboat.net/wwi/ships_hit/7426.html | work = U-Boat War in World War I | publisher = Uboat.net | date =  | accessdaymonth = 22 January | accessyear = 2009 }}</ref> The following day Pr<U+00E1>sil attempted to torpedo a ship in a convoy but missed and was exposed to a depth charge attack by the convoy's escorts. The U-boat ended the patrol with no further successes.<ref name=Tengeral />

In June, the Austro-Hungarian Navy planned an assault on the [[Otranto Barrage]], similar to a May 1917 action that evolved into the [[Battle of Otranto Straits (1917)|Battle of Otranto Straits]].<ref name=Hal-174>Halpern, pp. 174<U+2013>75.</ref> ''U-29'' was deployed from Cattaro on 9 June in advance of the attack.<ref name=Tengeral /> One of the seven separate groups participating in the attack, the two dreadnoughts {{SMS|Tegetthoff||2}} and {{SMS|Szent Istv<U+00E1>n||2}}, came under attack from Italian [[MAS (ships)|MAS]] torpedo boats in the early morning hours of 10 June. ''Szent Istv<U+00E1>n'' was hit and sank just after 06:00, and the entire operation was called off.<ref name=Hal-174>Halpern, pp. 174<U+2013>75.</ref> ''U-29'' returned to Cattaro on 12 June. Over the next two months, ''U-29'' operated in the [[Adriatic]] out of Cattaaro, patrolling off [[Durazzo]] and the [[Albania]]n coast.<ref name=Tengeral />

While at Cattaro, command of ''U-29'' passed to ''Linenschiffleutnant'' Friedrich Sterz on 4 September. The 27-year-old native of [[Pergine Valsugana|Pergine]], [[History of Tyrol|Tyrolia]] (in present-day Italy), had previously commanded {{SMS|U-22|Austria-Hungary|2|sub=y}} and, like Pr<U+00E1>sil, had also served a stint as commander of ''U-10''.<ref name=Sterz>{{cite web | last = Helgason | first = Gu<U+00F0>mundur | title = WWI U-boat commanders: Friedrich Sterz | url = http://uboat.net/wwi/men/commanders/538.html | work = U-Boat War in World War I | date =  | accessdaymonth = 22 January | accessyear = 2009 }}</ref> After assuming command of ''U-29'', Sterz set sail for Durazzo the same day. The U-boat had encounters with MAS torpedo boats on 9 and 12 September. On the latter date, ''U-29'' had to crash dive to avoid a bombing attack from [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] airplanes. None of the seven bombs hit their mark and ''U-29'' returned to Cattaro on 16 September.

''Linenschiffleutnant'' Robert D<U+00FC>rrial replaced Sterz as commander on 29 September. The [[Galicia]]n D<U+00FC>rrial, like both Stertz and Pr<U+00E1>sil, had served as the commander of ''U-10'', but had most recently commanded {{SMS|U-21|Austria-Hungary|2|sub=y}}.<ref name=D<U+00FC>rrial>{{cite web | last = Helgason | first = Gu<U+00F0>mundur | title = WWI U-boat commanders: Robert D<U+00FC>rrial | url = http://uboat.net/wwi/men/commanders/538.html | work = U-Boat War in World War I | date =  | accessdaymonth = 22 January | accessyear = 2009 }}</ref> A day after assuming command, D<U+00FC>rrial headed for the Albanian coast in ''U-29'' and patrolled off Durazzo.<ref name=Tengeral />

After the [[Armistice with Bulgaria (World War I)|Armistice with Bulgaria]] on 29 September ended Bulgaria's participation in the war, Durazzo gained importance to the remaining [[Central Powers]] as the main port for supplying their forces fighting in the [[Balkans]]. Anticipating this, the Allies put together a force to bombard Durazzo. While the second echelon of the attacking force got into position to bombard the town, ''U-29'' and sister boat {{SMS|U-31|Austria-Hungary|2|sub=y}} maneuvered to attack. While ''U-31'' was able to hit and damage the British cruiser {{HMS|Weymouth|1910|2}}, ''U-29'' was blocked by screening ships and herself attacked. The Allied escorts subjected ''U-29'' to a heavy depth charge attack.<ref name=Hal-175>Halpern, pp. 175<U+2013>76.</ref> ''U-29'' was able to make her way back to Cattaro on 8 October.<ref name=Tengeral />

Over the next three weeks, ''U-29'' patrolled between Cattaro and [[Antivari]], [[Montenegro]]. After her arrival back at Cattaro on 1 November, ''U-29'' was moored between the [[coastal defence ship|coastal battleship]] {{SMS|Monarch||2}} and {{SMS|U-14|Austria-Hungary|2|sub=y}}. There she remained until she was awarded to France as a [[war reparation]] in 1920. ''U-29'' was towed, along with sister boats ''U-31'' and {{SMS|U-41|Austria-Hungary|2|sub=y}}, from Cattaro for [[Bizerta]] for scrapping, but foundered on the way.<ref name=Gib-388>Gibson and Prendergast, pp. 388<U+2013>89.</ref> In total, ''U-29'' sank three ships with a combined tonnage of 14,784, and damaged one warship.
