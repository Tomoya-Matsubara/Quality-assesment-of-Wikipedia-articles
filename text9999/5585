'''Carucage''' was a land tax in medieval England, based on the size of the estate owned by the taxpayer, and was a replacement for the older [[danegeld]], which was last collected in 1162. Carucage was first collected by King [[Richard I of England]] in 1194, and was sporadically assessed through the following two reigns, but the last time it was assessed was in 1224. Thereafter, it was replaced by taxes on income and moveable property. 

It was only collected six times in the years between 1194 and 1224, and never raised sums as large as other taxes collected. The main revenue sources for the government in this time came from royal and feudal rights. The method of assessing the size of the estate owned changed from the early use of the [[Domesday Book|Domesday Survey]] assessments to new valuations based on either sworn testimony of neighbors or a calculation based on the number of ploughteams used by the taxpayer. The tax was collected for a variety of reasons, from the need to pay Richard's ransom in 1194 to King [[John of England|John's]] use of it as a way to pay his inheritance relief in 1200. King [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] used it to pay for military campaigns, both in England and on the continent.

==Background==

English taxation after the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman Conquest]] was based on the [[geld]] or [[danegeld]], a national tax paid by all free men. The king could demand payment of geld without consultation with his barons or other subjects, and could assess it at varying levels. It was based on the number of [[Hide (unit)|hides]] of land owned by the taxpayer.<ref name=Huscroft98/> A hide was a variable amount of land, often equated to the amount of land required to support a family for a year, or the amount of land an eight-ox ploughteam would plough in one year.<ref name=Dict154>Coredon ''Dictionary of Medieval Terms and Phrases'' p. 154</ref>{{#tag:ref|The total amount varied wildly depending on the fertility of the land. The size could be as small as {{convert|40|acre|ha}} in Berkshire, up to {{convert|120|acre|ha}} elsewhere.<ref name=Dict154/>|group=notes}} However, during King [[Henry I of England|Henry I's]] reign, increasing numbers of exemptions and the difficulties encountered in collecting the geld decreased its importance to the [[Exchequer]]. During the [[The Anarchy|disorders of King Stephen's]] reign, it is unclear if geld was collected at all.<ref name=Huscroft98>Huscroft ''Ruling England'' pp. 98<U+2013>99, 166</ref> Stephen's successor, King [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] collected geld twice, once in 1155 and again in 1161<U+2013>1162, but did not collect it again during his reign. Because of its unpopularity, the halting of geld may have been a political compromise on Henry's part.<ref name=Huscroft166>Huscroft ''Ruling England'' pp. 166<U+2013>167</ref>

==Under Richard I==

Under Henry's son King [[Richard I of England|Richard I]], the geld was replaced with the carucage which was also based on land.<ref name=Govern105/> Carucage was first collected in 1194, and was established by [[Hubert Walter]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] and [[Justiciar]] of England. It was the first land tax collected in England since the geld's elimination.<ref name=Lyon253>Lyon ''Constitutional and Legal History'' p. 253</ref> The basis of the tax was the size of the estate in hides or [[carucate]]s.<ref name=Govern105>Richardson and Sayles ''Governance of Mediaeval England'' p. 105</ref> The carucate was a unit of land that could be ploughed by an eight-ox ploughteam in a year,<ref name=Dict61>Coredon ''Dictionary of Medieval Terms and Phrases'' p. 61</ref> and was normally considered to be equivalent to a hide.<ref name=Hudson241>Hudson ''Formation of the English Common Law'' p. 241</ref>  This collection of the carucage was actually a [[feudal aid]], rather than a tax, as it was first levied under King [[Richard I of England]] in order to pay Richard's ransom when he was imprisoned returning from the Third Crusade. In 1194, the assessment was based upon the [[Domesday Book|Domesday Survey]], completed in 1087.<ref name=Lyon269/>

In 1198 the carucage was again collected and was based on the carucate, figured at {{convert|100|acre|ha}},<ref name=Lyon269/> or {{convert|120|acre|ha}}.<ref name=Tax154>Mitchell ''Taxation'' p. 154</ref> This levy was often titled the "great carucage". A first assessment of 2 shillings per carucate was made, then later a further 3 shillings was ordered.<ref name=Tax14>Mitchell ''Taxation'' pp. 14<U+2013>15</ref> This tax was collected to provide the king with money for his military campaigns in France,<ref name=Tax179>Mitchell ''Taxation'' p. 179</ref> and raised about <U+00A3>1000.<ref name=Richard637>Barratt "English Revenue of King Richard" ''English Historical Review'' p. 637</ref> Later, a number of fines were levied on taxpayers for evading payment.{{#tag:ref|These are recorded in the 1199 Pipe Roll.<ref name=Richard642/>|group=notes}} That fines needed to be paid suggests that the 1198 tax was not very successful.<ref name=Richard642>Barratt "English Revenue of King Richard" ''English Historical Review'' p. 642</ref>

The medieval chronicler [[Roger of Howden]] is the main source for information on the 1198 carucage.<ref name=Tax14/> According to Roger, assessments were carried out in each shire by a commission of two royal officials who worked in each [[Hundred (administrative division)|hundred]] with two local knights, who took sworn testimony in each village from four villagers and the [[bailiff]]s of the barons holding land in the village. The resulting assessments were recorded; the sheriff received the money and forwarded it to the treasury.<ref name=Lyon269>Lyon ''Constitutional and Legal History'' p. 269</ref> Estate holders in the area were responsible for the payments from their estates, and when they was handed into the Exchequer, a special procedure recorded the payments,<ref name=Warren147/> which were deposited into a special set of accounts.<ref name=Tax29>Mitchell ''Taxation'' p. 29</ref> These elaborate procedures were probably meant to avoid misappropriation of funds, but may not have succeeded because, later, justices were sent out with instructions to inquire into the commissioners' activities. As a result, 23 counties paid fines in order to secure an end to inquiries about the carucage.<ref name=Warren147>Warren ''Governance of Norman and Angevin England'' pp. 147<U+2013>148</ref>

In 1198, the clergy and ecclesiastics in England resisted Richard's attempt to collect the carucage from their estates. In response, Richard deprived the clergy of the use of the royal courts and forced them to buy back, for a sum greater than the carucage amount, the ability to use the courts.<ref name=Lyon305>Lyon ''Constitutional and Legal History'' pp. 305<U+2013>306</ref>

==Under John==

King [[John of England|John]], Richard's brother and successor, only collected the carucage once, in 1200. John set the amount to be collected from each carucate at 3 [[shillings]].<ref name=Lyon269/> Revenues from this taxation do not appear in the 1200 [[Pipe Roll]], which may mean that it was paid into a special commission in the Exchequer. Further evidence of this is the fact that [[William de Wrotham]] is designated as ''receptores carucagii'', or recievers of the carucage,<!--plural?--><!-- The source says carucagii, I double checked. Eald --> in official records.<ref name=Tax14/> It is unknown whether the assessments used the previous system from 1198 or if a new system was set up.<ref name=Tax65>Mitchell ''Taxation'' p. 65</ref> The medieval chronicler [[Ralph of Coggeshall]] noted that an "order went throughout England by the justices{{#tag:ref|Or possibly "from the justices" in place of "by the justices".<ref name=Tax83>Mitchell ''Taxation'' p. 83</ref>|group=notes}} or<!--not "of"?--><!-- Double checked, the source does indeed say "or" Eald. --> the king" to collect the tax.<ref name=QTax83>Quoted in Mitchell ''Taxation'' p. 83</ref> This may imply that the king appointed justices to collect the tax.<ref name=Tax83/> The carucage was raised in order to pay John's [[feudal relief]], or payment due on inheriting lands, for his 1199 inheritance of lands in France.<ref name=Tax179/> The relief had  been set by King [[Philip II of France]] at 20,000 [[mark (money)|marks]].<ref name=John148>Warren ''King John'' pp. 148<U+2013>149</ref> The carucage raised about <U+00A3>3000, although this is just an estimate from later revenues raised under the following reign.<ref name=Barratt839>Barratt "Revenue of King John" ''English Historical Review'' p. 839</ref>

The [[Cistercians|Cistercian]] monasteries in the north of England resisted paying the tax, claiming an immunity to taxation. John put pressure on them, as he was in the north when the tax was announced, but the various abbeys appealed to Hubert Walter, now chancellor. Walter secured the promise of a payment of <U+00A3>1000 from the abbeys as a group, but in June 1200 the king rejected the offer as too small. In October, the king returned from Normandy and resumed pressure on the monasteries, ordering the confiscation of all Cistercian livestock on royal lands after two weeks if a settlement was not reached. At the end of November, through the intercession of Walter, the king capitulated and recognized the Cistercian immunity from taxation.<ref name=Monastic366>Knowles ''Monastic Order in England'' pp. 366<U+2013>367</ref>

==Under Henry III==

John's son, King [[Henry III of England|Henry III]], only assessed the carucage three times, in 1217, 1220, and 1224. A new approach in 1217 and 1220 was to secure the consent of the great council for the levying of the tax, which was collected from both laymen and clergy.<ref name=Lyon384/> The 1217 tax was once more assessed at 3 shillings per carucate.<ref name=Tax135>Mitchell ''Taxation'' p. 135</ref> The assessment method to determine the amount of lands held by each taxpayer involved having each landowner provide the information, swearing an oath that it was correct.<ref name=Tax92>Mitchell ''Taxation'' p. 92</ref> Like the 1200 tax, the 1217 tax was not recorded in that year's Pipe Roll, leading to the possibility that that year's revenue was collected into a separate branch of the Exchequer.<ref name=Tax19/> The 1217 carucage was only paid by laymen; the clergy made a donation in lieu of being taxed.<ref name=Tax109>Mitchell ''Taxation'' p. 109</ref> The tax  was collected in order to defray the expenses of the war being fought against [[Louis VIII of France|Prince Louis of France]], who had invaded England before the death of King John and was claiming the English throne.<ref name=Harriss33/>

The 1220 carucage was definitely collected by a special commission, and it was paid not into the Exchequer, but instead was paid to the [[Templar Order]] church in London, the [[New Temple]]. The three men appointed to the commission were William de Halliwell, a friar, William FitzBenedict, a London resident, and Alexander de Sawbridgeworth, an Exchequer clerk.<ref name=Tax19>Mitchell ''Taxation'' p. 19</ref> The three commissioners were responsible for all the accounting for the sums received, which were over <U+00A3>3000.<ref name=Tax34>Mitchell ''Taxation'' p. 34</ref> The time frame of the 1220 carucage collection was quite short, with the orders for the assessments to be made going out in August, but requiring the tax to be collected by [[Michaelmas]] in late September.<ref name=Tax105>Mitchell ''Taxation'' p. 105</ref> The 1220 tax also attempted to allow for variation in land values, exempting wastelands from taxation.<ref name=Lyon384>Lyon ''Constitutional and Legal History'' p. 384</ref> The system for the 1220 assessments was simpler, as ploughteams were counted to determine the land size. This tax gathered around <U+00A3>5500.<ref name=Warren147/> There was some difficulty in collecting the tax, however, as some counties did not pay, and a number of barons rejected the tax, at least at first.<ref name=Tax137>Mitchell ''Taxation'' p. 137</ref> The 1220 carucage was for the defense of Poitou.<ref name=Harriss33/>

The 1224 carucage was actually an aid levied on the clergy alone,<ref name=Tax67>Mitchell ''Taxation'' p. 67</ref> and also did not appear in the Pipe Roll. Indications are that the clergy who were assessed for the tax also collected the tax. Records indicate that the bulk of the revenues raised were paid into the Wardrobe.<ref name=Tax20>Mitchell ''Taxation'' p. 20</ref> The 1224 assessment was also based on ploughteams,<ref name=Tax154/> and was assessed in order to pay for the recovery of  the lost lands in France.<ref name=Harriss33>Harriss ''King, Parliament, and Public Finance'' p. 33</ref>

==Legacy==

The tax was abandoned after 1224,<ref name=Tax154/> with later revenue being collected in taxes on moveable property, not land.<ref name=Lyon382>Lyon ''Constitutional and Legal History'' pp. 382<U+2013>384</ref> A probable reason for the abandonment of the tax was the greater revenues gained from other taxes.<ref name=Tax237>Mitchell ''Taxation'' p. 237</ref>

Carucage was an attempt to secure new sources of revenue to supplement [[scutage]], the fine paid by a knight or baron to avoid military service.<ref name=Dict252>Coredon ''Dictionary of Medieval Terms and Phrases'' p. 252</ref><ref name=Harriss9/> It was also supposed to help increase the royal revenues in the face of new demands on them. However, it came to be replaced by the taxes on moveable property that were first asssessed in 1207. Carucage, although deriving from the old danegeld, was a new experiment in revenue collection. However it was only collected for specific purposes, rather than as a general tax regularly assessed. A novel feature was the consultation with the barons and other leading members of the ruling classes.<ref name=Harriss9>Harriss ''King, Parliament, and Public Finance'' pp. 9<U+2013>15</ref> Although it was used intermittently to collect revenue during the reigns of Richard I and John and the early years of Henry III, the main source of royal income during these years remained scutage, feudal dues, and royal rights such as justice and manipulating the coinage.<ref name=Campbell51>Campbell "Some Observations on English Government" ''Transactions of the Royal Historical Society'' pp. 51<U+2013>52</ref>
