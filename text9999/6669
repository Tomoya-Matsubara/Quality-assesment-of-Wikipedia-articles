'''Unarius''' is a non-profit organization founded in 1954 in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]] and which is now headquartered in [[El Cajon|El Cajon, California]].  The organization purports to advance a new interdimensional science of [[life]].  The history of the organization can be marked by distinct periods of activity.  The interdimensional science of life is based upon purported fourth dimensional [[physics]] principles.  The founder, and subsequent "channels" and "sub-channels" have written books filled with such channeled dissertations from alleged advanced intelligent beings that exist on higher frequency planes.

Over 100 volumes have been published since 1954.  The membership over the decades is unknown, but based upon literature published by the organization approximately 100,000 people all over the world hold or maintain Unariun beliefs and live by them. Unarius centers exist in [[Canada]], [[Japan]], [[Nigeria]] and in various locations in the [[United States]].

==History==

The organization's history since 1954 has three major periods. From the period of 1954-1971, when Co-Founder Ernest Norman still controlled the organization, the organization defined "the mission" as the bringing in of this interdimensional science of life in the books channeled by Ernest Norman.  In the second period of 1972-1993, while Ruth Norman still guided the organization, the organization experienced renewed growth and public  awareness.  "The mission" became bringing Unarius to the masses.  Ruth Norman granted interviews, appeared on [[The Late Show]] with [[David Letterman]], The Susskind show and kept very up-to-date technologically with video productions and a studio built in the late 1970s when such equipment was still in its infancy. Unarius video productions began appearing on public access stations all over the United States. (Unarius Light Newsletter, 1978-80)

The 3rd period is from 1994-present wherein the organization has struggled without either of the founders and experienced the let-down of the failed 2001 prophecy of a space-fleet landing. (A prophecy channeled by Louis Spiegel in 1980.)

Like [[Scientology|Scientologists]], Unariuns believe in soulic [[immortality]] and that all people have past lives.  They also believe that our [[solar system]] was once inhabited by ancient interplanetary civilizations. While they seem to have similarity to the [[Aetherius Society]] or to [[Ra<U+00EB>lism]] as they emphasize "space brothers" who will come from the stars in 33 spaceships to improve humanity, these beliefs are not held by all Unariuns and in fact, are discounted by many as contradictory to true Unariun principle.

Founder Ernest Norman writes in his book, ''The Truth About Mars'', that the [[China|Chinese]] evolved from ancient interstellar migrants who began colonizing [[Mars]] a million years ago.  They are reported to have returned to Mars, where they live in underground cities, after being attacked by natives of the Earth.  A group which had become separated did not return with them and this group branched off and formed the various Asian racial genotypes. (Norman; The Truth About Mars, 1956)

== Founders ==

The group was founded by Ernest L. Norman and his wife Ruth E. Norman - Ruth later known within the group as both Ioshanna (1972-1979) & Uriel (1980-1993). The organization was founded in February, 1954 in Los Angeles, CA.    

Ernest L. Norman was an apparent child prodigy whose father came from [[Scandinavia]].  His father was a physician and Ernest read all his father's books eagerly, self-educating himself alongside his formal schooling.  He was born with an abnormally large cranium and as a child already wore an adult size hat.  He performed to family, neighbors and teachers unexpected feats such as moving a heavy rabbit hutch using Archimedean principles and small logs, building radios and winning arguments with parents and teachers at an early age.  Claiming to possess [[psychic]] ability, he told women of their loved one's whereabouts and often deaths during the [[World War II]] years of 1942-1945. When this practice, of accurately describing fatalities, lowered morale at war plants where he worked, he left and started to give lectures espousing his own philosophy in theosophical churches during the mid to late [[1940s|Forties]].  (Norman; ''Biography of Unarius'', 1975)

Ruth E. Norman was the oldest of eight children, born in 1900.  She took many jobs early on to help support her family.  She had purchased a motel, run a restaurant, worked at a cannery and worked in numerous other professions during her first fifty years. By the early 1950s mystics at a "psychic convention" she attended told her that she was being followed around by long-bearded wise men carrying books and that she would help bring in these books in her future.  This same thing had been told to Ernest by other mystics at this same convention and when the two met and later married, within weeks, Ernest began to produce, by channeling, the first Unarius book, ''The Voice of Venus''. (Norman; ''Bridge to Heaven'', 1969)

== Early Years ==

The formation of the mission in February, 1954 by Ernest and Ruth Norman led to the publication of the "Voice Series" of books.  "The Voice of Venus" was authored by Ernest L. Norman and is a channeled work.  However he claims it was not channeled in any special meditative, trance-like state or in a darkened room, but spoken normally and recorded on tape. Norman generally held modern spiritualist and theosophical  movements and practices to be backwards and less enlightened.  The work describes communication from Mal-Var of [[Venus]] who proceeds to give a tour of the Venusian capital.  In the work, Venusians are described as having ''energy bodies'' and live in a plane of frequency vibration that would be [[invisible]] to a human were he to stand in the middle of the city known as "Azure".  The planet Venus and its culture are said to be more spiritual than that of the [[Earth]] and that more advanced Earth-dwellers visit and study on Venus when they sleep. Healing wards for human [[suicides]], [[drunks]], the [[mentally disabled|mentally impaired]] and similar human wreckage exist in Azure and these souls are treated with positive energy and light to help them [[reincarnate]] with greater integration. (Norman; ''Voice of Venus'', 1956) 

The Voice Series consists of seven books:

*''[[The Voice of Venus]]''
*''[[The Voice of Eros]]''
*''[[The Voice of Orion]]''
*''[[The Voice of Hermes]]''
*''[[The Voice of Muse, Unarius & Elysium.]]''

The seven books describe the seven planes of Shamballa, which are claimed to exist outside the conventional [[atomic]] spectrum and are spiritual or non-physical [[worlds]].  Each plane has a specialty in the teaching of advanced principles, for the betterment of an individual's progressive evolution from life to life.

The plane's specialties are:

* Venus - ''Healing''
* Eros - ''Science''
* Orion - ''Education''
* Hermes - ''Philosophy''
* Muse - ''The Arts''
* Unarius - ''Leadership''
* Elysium - ''Devotion''

These books authored by Ernest L. Norman, along with ''The Infinite Concept of Cosmic Creation'', which were a series of 13 lectures given in 1956 and later compiled into book form with seven advanced lesson courses, constitute the early teachings and beliefs of Unarius.  The ''Voice Series'' books are written with famous past Earth denizens acting as the tour guides for these various planes.

== Origin of Unarius Name ==

The UNARIUS name comes from the Shamballa plane of leadership.  The mission to bring these various principles and knowledge to those who are ready is considered as falling under the leadership capacity.  Unarius is an acronym which stands for '''UN'''iversal '''AR'''ticulate '''I'''nterdimensional '''U'''nderstanding of '''S'''cience.

Unarius, as an organization, is strongly opposed to its common classification as a religion. Ernest L. Norman in several books presents the case against religion, most notably, ''The Infinite Contact'' , copyrighted in 1960, which describes in detail the origins of Christianity as rooted in Mithraism, Zoroastrianism and assorted ancient belief structures.  Ernest L. Norman agreed with [[Karl Marx]] that religions were "the opium of the people" and yet also claimed to realize that many individuals were still at such a point in their [[evolution]] where religions still served a positive purpose and kept them from harming their fellowmen.  Unarius calls its content and activities teaching ''interdimensional science''.

== The Principles / Beliefs ==

The practicing ''Unariun'' holds a set of ''concepts'' or, in lieu of physical proof, ''beliefs'' that act as a structure for their actions and thinking.

Some of these principles are:

*''' Everything is energy.'''
*''' Energy is never created or destroyed and merely changes form.'''
*''' You are energy and the energy that comprises you is never destroyed but also changes form.'''
*''' You, as a form of indestructible energy, possess a soul that has recorded data from past lives.'''
*''' All happenings to you currently have their origins in past lives and past actions.'''
*''' To progress one must record more positive actions than negative actions.'''
*''' Negative acts must be compensated for by positive acts.'''
*''' Various strata exist (outside of physical worlds) where beings of higher and lower nature reside.'''

These are the primary principles as explained by Ernest L. Norman in ''The Infinite Concept of Cosmic Creation'', Copyright 1956, 1960 Edition.

For the practicing Unariun these are the most important aspects of Unarius.  Although the group is generally known for its predictions regarding [[flying saucers]] landing on Earth,  Ernest L. Norman stressed these scientific core understandings as the key to personal development and mastery over material circumstances and in one instance derided flying saucer chasers as just another manifestation of people pursuing an "escape mechanism". (Norman; ''The Infinite Concept of Cosmic Creation'', 1960)

== The Seventies ==

With the passing of co-founder Ernest Norman in 1971, the mission was continued by his wife and partner Ruth Norman.  New ''Sub-Channels'' now authored the books with her.  The two sub-channels were Thomas Miller and Louis Spiegel and they are credited on a number of the organizations books starting in 1972.  After a channeling revealed a lifetime lived in ancient Atlantis with the name ''Ioshanna'', she adopted the name ''Ioshanna'' during this period.  The organization had moved its base from Glendale, California to El Cajon, California where a teaching center with a Grecian-style motif was opened up for the first time in 1975.  Before this time, from 1954-1974 meetings were held in Ruth Norman's home or at public meeting facilities. (''Unarius Light'', 1975)

The organization channeled works from [[Nikola Tesla]], who in a series of books, The ''Tesla Speaks'' series, brings in information for the completion of his wireless power tower (The Wardenclyffe Tower). Other devices such as healing devices and a past life viewer were also planned to be brought in to help mankind live a cleaner, more constructive life.  A future city was designed and a mock-up was built by students of Unarius. (Norman; ''Biography of Unarius'', 1975) The mock-up featured the power-tower predominantly in the center (later images from ''UNARIUS LIGHT'' newsletters dating 1981 show the same mock-up modified to feature 33 spacecraft in the center of the city).

It was at this time, 1972, that the channelings were brought in referring to ''33 worlds of an interplanetary confederation''.  These worlds all had various problems and by communicating with Ioshanna, many of their hang-ups were solved or on the way to resolution. (Norman, Miller, Spiegel; ''33 Worlds Speak to Earth'', 1972) It was during this time that Louis Spiegel first channeled a message predicting a landing of [[spacecraft]] to greet Ioshanna in 1976.  The other sub-channel, Thomas Miller disagreed with this channeling and a [[schism (religion)|schism]] opened up between the two.  When the landing failed to materialize it was realized that this scenario was a negative "past life reliving" and the channeling was contaminated by Spiegel's lower ''sub-conscious'' self. (''Unarius Light'', 1976)

As a result, a number of Unariuns were ''skeptical'' about the future predictions of a spacefleet landing, also channeled by Louis Spiegel.  His prediction of a spacefleet landing in 2001, being the most famous prediction and with wagers being placed with Lloyd's of London.  Many Unarians felt that these predictions undermined the original mission of Ernest L. Norman and a falling out occurred.  Circa 1980 Thomas Miller, the primary sub-channel left the organization, leaving Louis Spiegel as the only sub-channel. (''Unarius Light'', 1980)  From this point forward, ever more activities revolved around these predictions.  Ruth Norman, born in 1900 and now 80, participated less and less in the goings on at the center and so Unarians turned primarily to Louis Spiegel (aka Antares, Vaughn & Charles)for guidance and instruction. (''Unarius Light'', 1981-88)

In the early 1970s a ''Conclave of Light'' celebration had occurred and was staged at the Grant Hotel in [[San Diego]], California and repeated yearly at different venues, and after 1975 at the Unarius center in El Cajon, CA. (''Unarius Light'', 1975)  This celebration was later replaced in the 1980's with an Interplanetary Confederation day. (''Unarius Light'', 1980)

== The Schism ==

Unarius is generally comprised of two types of students, the followers of Ernest L. Norman's original texts and works and those that believe in every channeling that occurred after Ernest L. Norman's death.  The latter group is often blamed by the former for the ridicule and mockery the organization has received by the general public since the early 80s and more so in the [[internet]] age for the conversion of the group to a "flying saucer group."  

* Schism Example:  Unarius.com[http://www.Unarius.com]

== The Eighties ==

The early eighties brought about the development of a video production studio and the marketing of UNARIUS videos through public access channels all over the nation. (''Unarius Light'', 1983) From a public relations standpoint Unarius made big inroads during this period with new centers being opened up in other parts of the United States, Canada and Nigeria. During this period the public identity of the organization changed from one which was teaching a "metaphysical science of life" to that of a "flying saucer group."

== The Nineties ==

Ruth Norman after several falls and surgeries in the late eighties had very limited contact with the students and members.  Louis Spiegel assumed the leadership role in the organization by default. Ruth Norman passed on in 1993.  Another small schism occurred wherein many students left the organization because they disagreed with the channelings of Louis Spiegel, particularly one which referenced that it was time for "Uriel" to return to the inner and seemed in complete opposition to previously expounded Unariun principle, wherein "brothers" ''never'' engaged in interfering with or predicting future human activities. Many Unariuns perceived such as a power-grab against the aged and mostly bed-ridden Ruth Norman and as a "negative reliving" and Unarius lost many students who became "home-study students" because of their opposition to Louis Spiegel and what were interpreted as a series of false, negative channelings.(''Unarius Light'', 1991-1993)

== 2001 ==

With 2001 having come and gone, and no space fleet landing having occurred, Unarius as an organization demonstrates both a returning to its roots and the principles, books and works of Ernest Norman, while simultaneously demonstrating a belief in a future landing by [[extraterrestrials]] to assist humankind.  With the passing of Louis Spiegel in late 1999, the organization has formed a small council which shares leadership and management responsibilities. (''Unarius Light'', Online Edition, 2000)

== Criticism ==

Ruth Norman (aka Uriel 1980-1993) has been criticized for her flamboyance & costumes worn in later years. Alex Heard, in ''Apocalypse Pretty Soon: Travels In End-Time America'' ISBN 0-385-49852-7, quipped of her that she was, "a true American original who combined the couture sensibilities of a [[drag queen]] with the joi de vivre of a [[Frisbee]]-chasing [[Irish Setter]]."
