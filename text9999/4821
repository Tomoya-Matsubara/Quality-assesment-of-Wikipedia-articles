'''''Passing''''' is a [[novel]] by American author [[Nella Larsen]], first published in [[1929 in literature|1929]]. Set primarily in in the [[Harlem]] neighborhood of [[New York City]] in the 1920s, the story centers on the reunion of two childhood friends of [[Multiracial|mixed-race]] ancestry<U+2014>Clare Kendry and Irene Redfield<U+2014>and their increasing fascination with each other's lives. The title and central theme of the novel refers to the practice of [[Race (human classification)|racial]] "[[Passing (racial identity)|passing]]"; Clare Kendry's passing as white for her husband, Jack Bellew, is the most significant depiction in the novel, and a catalyst for its tragic story.

''Passing'''s depiction of race is informed by the racial discussion taking place in the United States during the 1920s, and the "Rhinelander Case" is a notable precedent for the Kendry-Bellew relationship. Praised upon its publication, the novel has since been celebrated in modern scholarship for its complex depiction of race, gender and sexuality. As one of only two novels by Larsen<U+2014>along with ''[[Quicksand (Nella Larsen novel)|Quicksand]]''<U+2014>it has played a significant role in positioning her at the forefront of several [[Canon (fiction)|literary canons]].

==Background==
The 1920s in the United States was a period marked by considerable anxiety over the crossing of racial boundaries<U+2014>the so-called "color line" between blacks and whites.<ref name="Kaplan 2007, pp. xvi<U+2013>xvii.">Kaplan 2007, pp. xvi<U+2013>xvii.</ref> The practice of crossing the color line and attempting to be recognized as a member of another racial group came to be known as "[[Passing (racial identity)|passing]]".<ref>{{cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Caleb|title=Crossing the Color Line|journal=Outlook and Independent|year=1931|month=August|volume=158}} (Reprinted from {{cite book|last=Larson|first=Nella|title=Passing|year=2007|publisher=W.

Johnson]] (1893 <U+2013> 1956) calculated that 355,000 blacks had passed between 1900 and 1920.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Charles S.|title=Editorial|journal=Opportunity|year=1925|volume=3|issue=34|page=291}} (Quoted by {{cite book|last=Sollors|first=Werner|title=Neither Black Nor White, Yet Both: Thematic Explorations of Interracial Literature|year=1997|publisher=Oxford UP|location=New York|page=281}})</ref>

A significant precedent for Larsen's depiction of Clare Kendry's and Jack Bellew's relationship was the 1927 legal trial known as the "Rhinelander Case" (or ''Rhinelander v. Rhinelander'').<ref name="Onwuachi-Willig 2007, p. 2394.">Onwuachi-Willig 2007, p. 2394.</ref> The case was an annulment proceeding in which wealthy, white [[Kip Rhinelander|Leonard Kip Rhinelander]] sued his wife, Alice Beatrice Jones, for fraud; he alleged that she had failed to inform him of her "colored" blood.<ref name="Onwuachi-Willig 2007, p. 2394<U+2013>5.">Onwuachi-Willig 2007, p. 2394<U+2013>5.</ref><ref name="Thaggert 2005, p. 2.">Thaggert 2005, p. 2.</ref> Although the jury eventually returned a verdict for Alice, it came at a devastating social cost for both parties<U+2014>the intimate exchanges between the couple were read out in court,<ref name="Thaggert 2005, p. 18.">Thaggert 2005, p. 18.</ref> and Alice was forced to disrobe in front of the jury in order to assess the darkness of her skin.<ref name="Thaggert 2005, pp. 18<U+2013>22.">Thaggert 2005, pp. 18<U+2013>22.</ref> The case is mentioned near the end of the novel, when Irene wonders about the consequences of Jack discovering Clare's racial status: <U+201C>What if Bellew should divorce Clare?

==Plot summary==
[[File:Drake Hotel Chicago postcard 1920.jpg|right|thumb|The Drake Hotel in Chicago, Illinois, on which the "Drayton Hotel" in ''Passing'' is principally modeled<ref name="Kaplan 2007, p. 8.">Kaplan 2007, p. 8.</ref>]]
The book opens with Irene Redfield receiving a letter from Clare Kendry, causing her to recall a chance encounter she had with her at the roof restaurant of the Drayton Hotel in [[Chicago]], during a brief stay in the city. The women<U+2014>both of mixed ancestry<U+2014>were once friends, but lost touch when Clare's father died and she went to live with her two paternal white aunts. Irene is perturbed by her suggestion that she could "pass" for white<U+2014>as Clare does<U+2014>but is also fascinated by her. Although she attempts to rescind on a promise she made, she nevertheless meets up later with Clare and her black friend, Gertrude Martin. Towards the end of their talk, Clare's white husband John (Jack) Bellew arrives. Unaware that all three women are actually mixed race, Jack voices some very racist views and makes them uneasy.

Irene herself lives in the [[Harlem]] neighborhood of [[New York City]] where she identifies as black and is actively involved in the black community<U+2014>part of the committee for the "Negro Welfare League". Her husband is a black doctor, Brian Redfield. The book resumes in the present day with Clare and Irene fascinated and seduced by each other's lifestyles. However, Irene<U+2014>who has been constantly aware of Clare's attractiveness<U+2014>becomes suspicious that her husband is having an affair with Clare; whether or not this is true is never confirmed. During a shopping trip with her black friend Felise Freeland, Irene encounters Bellew, who becomes aware of her<U+2014>and by extension, Clare's<U+2014>racial status; Irene considers warning Clare, but decides against it. Later, Clare accompanies Irene and Brian to a party hosted by Felise on the top floor of a building. The gathering is interrupted by Bellew, who accuses Clare of being a "damned dirty nigger!". Irene rushes to Clare, who is sat by an open window. Clare then falls out of the window to the ground below, and is pronounced dead by the guests who eventually gather at the site<U+2014>whether she falls accidentally, is pushed by Irene, or attempts suicide, is unclear. The book ends with Irene's fragmented anguish at Clare's death.

==Themes==
===Race and the "Tragic Mulatto"===
{{Quote box |width=30em | bgcolor=#ACE1AF |align=left  |quote=Though ''Passing'' does indeed relate the tragic fate of a mulatto who passes for white, it also centers on jealousy, psychological ambiguity and intrigue. By focusing on the latter elements, ''Passing'' is transformed from an anachronistic, melodramatic novel into a skillfully executed and enduring  work of art.|salign=left |source=<U+2014>[[Claudia Tate]], 1980<ref name="Tate 1980, p. 142.">Tate 1980, p. 142.</ref>}}

''Passing'' has been described as "the tragic story of a beautiful light-skinned [[mulatto]] passing for white in high society."<ref>{{cite book|last=Larsen|first=Nella|year=1971|publisher=Collier|location=New York|editor=Hoyt Fuller|chapter=Cover remarks}}</ref> The [[tragic mulatto]] (also, "mulatta" when referring to a woman)<ref name="Kaplan 2007, p. 171.">Kaplan 2007, p. 171.</ref> is a [[stock character]] in early [[African-American literature]], the light-skinned offspring of a white slaveholder and his black slave, whose mixed heritage among a race-based society means she is unable to identify with either blacks or whites.<ref name="Pilgrim 2000">{{cite web

</ref> The resulting feeling of exclusion is variably manifested in self-loathing, [[Depression (mood)|depression]], alcoholism, sexual perversion, and attempts at suicide.<ref name="Pilgrim 2000" /> 

On the surface, ''Passing'' conforms to this stereotype in its portrayal of Clare Kendry, whose passing for white has tragic consequences.<ref name="Pilgrim 2000" /> However, the book resists the conventions of the genre through Clare's refusal to feel the expected anguish at the betrayal of her black identity, and her socializing with blacks for the purposes of excitement rather than racial solidarity.<ref name="Tate 1980, p. 142." /><ref name="Wall 1986, pp. 97<U+2013>8.">Wall 1986, pp. 97<U+2013>8.</ref> This has led scholars more generally to consider ''Passing'' as a novel in which the major concern is not race;<ref name="Wall 1986, p. 98.">Wall 1986, p. 98.</ref> [[Claudia Tate]] describes the issue as "merely a mechanism for setting the story in motion, sustaining the suspense, and bringing about the external circumstances for the story's conclusion.<ref name="Tate 1980, p. 143.">Tate 1980, p. 143.</ref>

===Homosexuality===
Scholars have identified a [[Homosexuality|homoerotic]] subplot between Irene and Clare, centered on the erotic undertones in Irene's descriptions of Clare.<ref name="Blackmore 1992, p. 475<U+2013>6.">Blackmore 1992, p. 475<U+2013>6.</ref> In this interpretation, the novel's central metaphor of "passing" under a different identity "occurs at a surprisingly wide variety of levels."<ref name="Blackmore 1992, p. 475.">Blackmore 1992, p. 475.</ref> The apparently sexless marriage between Brian and Clare<U+2014>e.g., their separate bedrooms and identification as co-parents rather than sexual partners<ref name="Blackmore 1992, p. 475.">Blackmore 1992, p. 475.</ref><U+2014>allows Larsen to "flirt, if only by suggestion, with the idea of a [[lesbian]] relationship between 
[Clare and Irene]".<ref name="McDowell 1986, p. xxiii.">McDowell 1986, p. xxiii.</ref> Brian has been subject to a similar interpretation: Irene's labeling of him as [[wiktionary:queer|queer]] and his oft-expressed desire to go to Brazil<U+2014>a country then more tolerant of homosexuality than the United States<U+2014>are given as evidence.<ref name="Blackmore 1992, pp. 476<U+2013>7.">Blackmore 1992, pp. 476<U+2013>7.</ref>

==Reception==
{{Quote box |width=30em | bgcolor=#ACE1AF |align=right  |quote="Passing" is on the whole an effective and convincing attempt to portray certain aspects of a vexatious problem.

''Passing'' was published in April 1929 by [[Alfred A. Knopf|Knopf]] in New York.<ref name="Kaplan 2007, pp. 537, 539.">Kaplan 2007, pp. 537, 539.</ref> Sales of the book were modest<U+2014>Knopf produced three, small print runs each under 2,000 copies<U+2014>and while early reviews were primarily positive, it achieved little attention beyond New York City.<ref name="Kaplan 2007, p. xiv.">Kaplan 2007, p. xiv.</ref> Comparing it to Larsen's previous novel ''[[Quicksand (Nella Larsen novel)|Quicksand]]'', Alice Dunbar-Nelson's review in the ''The Washington Eagle'' began by declaring that "Nella Larsen delights again with her new novel".<ref name="Dunbar-Nelson 1929">{{cite news|last=Dunbar-Nelson|first=Alice|title=As in a Looking Glass|newspaper=The Washington Eagle|date=May 3, 1929}}</ref> [[W. E. B. Du Bois]] hailed it as the "one of the finest novels of the year", and believed that its limited success was due to it treating a "forbidden subject"<U+2014>the marriage of a white man to a mixed race girl.<ref name="W. E. B. DuBois 1929">{{cite journal|last=Du Bois|first=W. E.

Norton & Company|location=New York|isbn=978-0-393-97916-9|editor=Carla Kaplan|page=85}})</ref> A criticism made by many was the suddenness of the novel's ending. Mary Rennels, writing in the ''[[New York Telegram]]'', believed that "Larsen didn't solve the problem [of passing]. Knocking a character out of a scene doesn't settle a matter."<ref name="Rennels 1929">{{cite news|last=Rennels|first=Mary|title="Passing" Is a Novel of Longings"|newspaper=[[The New York Telegram]]|date=April 27, 1929}} (Reprinted from {{cite book|last=Larson|first=Nella|title=Passing|year=2007|publisher=W.

In modern scholarship, Larsen is recognized as one of the central figures in the [[African-American literature|African-American]], [[Feminist literary criticism|feminist]] and [[Modernist literature|modernist]] [[Canon (fiction)|canons]], a reputation that depends on her modest output of two novels<U+2014>''Passing'' and ''Quicksand''<U+2014>and some [[short story|short stories]].<ref name="Kaplan 2007, p. ix.">Kaplan 2007, p. ix.</ref> As of 2007, ''Passing'' is the subject of over two hundred scholarly articles and more than fifty dissertations,<ref name="Kaplan 2007, p. ix.">Kaplan 2007, p. ix.</ref><ref name="Kaplan 2007, p. 539<U+2013>46.">Kaplan 2007, p. 539<U+2013>46.</ref> offering a range of critical interpretations of the novel. It has been hailed as a text helping to "create a modernist psychological interiority <U+2026> challenging marriage and middle-class domesticity, complexly interrogating gender, race, and sexual identity, and for redeploying traditional [[Trope (literature)|tropes]]<U+2014>such as that of the tragic mulatta<U+2014>with a contemporary and critical twist."<ref name="Kaplan 2007, p. ix." /> However, [[Cheryl Wall|Cheryl A. Wall]] summarizes the critical response to ''Passing'' as less favorable than to Larsen's first novel ''Quicksand''.<ref name="Wall 1986, p. 105.">Wall 1986, p. 105.
<br>"These conclusions reflect the views, respectively, of Amaritjit Singh in ''The Novels of the Harlem Renaissance'' (99), of Robert Bone in ''The Negro Novel in America'' (102), and of Hoyt Fuller in his "Introduction" to ''Passing'' (14)."</ref> On the one hand the significance of sexual jealousy in the story has been seen to detract from the topic of racial passing; conversely, even if racial passing is accurately treated in the novel, it was a historically specific practice, and therefore ''Passing'' appears dated and trivial.<ref name="Wall 1986, p. 105." />
