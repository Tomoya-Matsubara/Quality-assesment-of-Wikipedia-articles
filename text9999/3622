Subsequent positions included Under-Secretary to the Government of [[Bombay]] (Political and Judicial Departments), 1907; Collector, 1920; Secretary of the Political Department, 1922; Chief Secretary to the Government, 1924;<ref>''Who<U+2019>s Who<U+2013>India'', 1927 ed., p. 114.</ref> Member of the Executive Council (MEC) of Bombay, 1926-31; and rising to become Home Member and Acting [[List of Governors of Bombay|Governor of Bombay]], 1931.<ref>''Debrett's Peerage, Baronetage, Knightage, and Companionage'', ed. Arthur G.M. Hesilrige (London: Dean & Son, 1933), p. 1062.</ref>  He was appointed OBE on 3 June 1918, Companion of the Most Exalted [[Order of the Star of India]] (CSI) in the [[1926 Honours Lists|New Year Honours, 1926]], and elevated to Knight Commander (KCSI) in 1930. 

==Naturalist==
Hotson served in the Indian Army Reserve of Officers, 1915 to 1920, in [[Balochistan (region)|Baluchistan]] and [[Persian Empire|Persia]], attaining the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel. Hotson was a dedicated naturalist who "collected plants in Persian Baluchistan and Makran coast, 1916-18, which were sent to [[Ethelbert Blatter|Father Blatter]] in Bombay".<ref><U+2018>Contributions towards Fl. Baluchistan from Materials supplied by Capt. J.E.B. Hotson<U+2019> (''Journal of the Indian Botanical Society'' vol. 1 (1919), pp. 84-91: 'Plants at Bombay'.</ref> His collections of mammal specimens from the same region during this period was described by the noted British zoologist [[Oldfield Thomas]], FRS, who noted:
<blockquote>Among the fine series of Mammals from Baluchistan contributed by Col. J.E.B. Hotson to the Bombay Natural History Society there occur a number of interesting small mammals which have been put into my hands for examination. As a result the following new species seem to require description.</blockquote>
Thomas then lists seven new species, two of which, [[Hotson's Jerboa]] (''Allactaga hotsoni'') and [[Hotson's Mouse-like Hamster]] (''Calomyscus hotsoni'') he names after their collector.<ref>Thomas, Oldfield. 1920. 'Some new Mammals from Baluchistan and North-West India', ''Journal of the Bombay Natural History Society'', vol. 26, no. 4, pp. 933-940.</ref> 

Hotson acted as Consul at Shiraz (Persia) between 1918 and 1920, during which time he continued his collecting of native mammals. The specimens he collected between February and August 1919 were described by Major [[R E Cheesman|R.E. Cheesman]], MBOU, FRGS, and included a new species of [[Persian Vole]] (''Microtus irani'').<ref>Maj. R.E. Cheesman, 'Report on a collection of mammals made by Col. J.E.B. Hotson in Shiraz, Persia', ''Journal of the Bombay Natural History Society'', vol. 27, no. 3, pp. 573-581.</ref> 

==Post-World War I service==
In 1924 Hotson married Mildred Alice, daughter of Arthur Bennett Steward (a fellow member of the ICS); this coincides with his elevation to the position of Chief Secretary to the Government of Bombay. This was a period of rising instability in India, that would lead eventually to its independence from the British crown in 1947. Mahatma Gandhi's theory of non-violent resistance to British rule, [[Satyagraha]], was not always followed, especially within the Presidency (State) of [[Maharashtra]] that surrounded Bombay. After the arrest of the national leaders [[Khurshed Nariman]] and [[Jamnalal Bajaj]] on 8 May 1930, mass demonstrations in the district of Sholapur led the Collector, Mr Knight, to seek advice from Hotson who was now in Bombay as the Home Member. The visit resulted in the imposition of martial law on 12 May.<ref name="history">''Maharashtra State Gazetteer: Sholapur District'' 2nd (rev.) ed. (Bombay: Government of Maharashtra, 1977), p. 101 ('History').</ref> Martial law was lifted on 30 June, however, a year later, on 22 July 1931, as Acting Governor of Bombay in the period after the departure of Sir [[Frederick Sykes]], Hotson was visiting the library of Fergusson College in Pune (Poona) when one of the students, Vasudeo Balwant Gogte (Gogate), attempted to assassinate him.<ref>''Bulletin of International News'' (Royal Institute of International Affairs), vol. 8 (1931-1932), p. 86.</ref><ref> Y.D. Phadke, ''Senapati Bapat: Portrait of a Revolutionary (Bombay: Semapati Bapat Centenary Celebration Samiti, 1981), p. 48.</ref> The bullet was stopped by a metal stud on Hotson's clothes, and he escaped unharmed. When asked why he had shot at the Home Member, Gogte is reported to have said "As a protest against your tyrannical administration".<ref name="history"/>

As well as a naturalist, Hotson was also a keen [[Philately|philatelist]], serving as President of the Philatelic Society of India, and editor of the ''Philatelic Journal of India'', 1923-28.<ref>[http://www.ukphilately.org.uk/bpt/whowaswho/whowaswho-h.htm British Philatelic Trust, Rowland Hill, promotion of "the study, research and dissemination of knowledge" about philately - UK Philately, Stamps and stamp collecting plus much, much more GB<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
