The '''2009 Ladbrokes.com World Darts Championship''' was the 16th World Championship organised by the [[Professional Darts Corporation]] since it separated from the [[British Darts Organisation]]. 

[[John Part]] was the defending champion having won the PDC World Championship for the second time in last year's final against [[Kirk Shepherd]]. However, he was eliminated by [[Bill Davis (darts player)|Bill Davis]] on the opening night by three sets to nil. Shepherd's poor form in 2008 continued, as he was also eliminated in the first round, by Dutchman [[Jan van der Rassel]]. Eventually, the title was won in dominant fashion by [[Phil Taylor]], with a 7-1 victory &ndash; and a world record average for a tournament final of 110.94 &ndash; over [[Raymond van Barneveld]]. The title was Taylor's twelfth in the PDC from fifteen finals, and his fourteenth in total. The tournament was also notable for featuring the first ever [[nine dart finish]] at the [[PDC World Darts Championship|PDC World Championship]] - completed by van Barneveld in his quarter-final match with [[Jelle Klaasen]].

The event took place from December 19, 2008 to January 4, 2009 - albeit with two breaks in between for [[Christmas]] and [[New Year]]. Again, the tournament was held at [[London]]'s [[Alexandra Palace]] having moved from the [[Circus Tavern]] in [[Purfleet]] for the [[2008 PDC World Darts Championship|2008 competition]].

==Tournament Review==
===Day One, Friday 19 December===
====Preliminary Round====
:Warren French 5-3 Akihiro Nagakawa

====First Round====
:Roland Scholten 2-3 Carlos Rodriguez (2-3, 3-1, 2-3, 3-0, 1-3)
:Wayne Jones 1-3 Robert Thornton (3-2, 1-3, 2-3, 2-3)
:John Part 0-3 Bill Davis (1-3, 2-3, 2-3)
:Andy Jenkins 1-3 Co Stomp<U+00E9> (2-3, 3-2, 2-3, 1-3)

The opening match of the tournament was an international affair, seeing Spain's [[Carlos Rodriguez (darts player)|Carlos Rodriguez]] take on sixteenth seed [[Roland Scholten]] of the Netherlands. Scholten was struggling with a shoulder/neck injury and in his last televised match - the first round of the [[2008 European Championship Darts|2008 European Championship]] - he had averaged 52. Rodriguez on the other hand had defeated fifth seed [[Terry Jenkins]] in the same tournament. True to form, the first set went to the Spaniard, including a 121 checkout. Scholten then hit back to take the second before Rodriguez included an 11 darter in taking the third set 3-2. The Dutchman included an 11 darter of his own as he took the next set without reply and looked to have the momentum going into the decider, but it was perhaps one set too far as the injury took its toll on Scholten's game and Rodriguez won the set - and the match - fairly comfortably. Scholten did not disgrace himself with an 80 average this time around, though Rodriguez' 88 showed the scoring power that gave him the match.

A preliminary round game followed between Japan's [[Akihiro Nagakawa]] and New Zealand's [[Warren French]], to be contested over nine legs. This was probably for the better as neither player hit top form, both averaging 54, which was a factor in [[Sky Sports]] stopping footage of the game halfway through. French had double trouble in the opening legs, letting Nagakawa take a 2-0 lead, but he soon improved, reeling off four legs on the trot to take the match. 

Highly fancied [[Robert Thornton (darts player)|Robert Thornton]] took on twenty-fifth seed [[Wayne Jones (darts player)|Wayne Jones]] in the next match. Thornton, the lone Scotsman in the competition, joined the PDC in May 2008 and had already risen up to thirty-fifth in the PDC Order of Merit. Jones, a semi-finalist here in 2006, took the first set, but Thornton, averaging 94, took the next three without reply to win the match. 

The tournament lit up in the next match as American [[Bill Davis (darts player)|Bill Davis]] sensationally defeated the defending champion and fourth seed, Canadian [[John Part]], 3-0. A slow start from Part allowed Davis to take the first set with a 116 checkout, and the American took a two legs lead in the second set with a 120 checkout. This seemed to awaken the defending champion, who hit five 180s in the next three legs, but missed doubles for the set cost him as Davis took a 2-0 lead. The final set went to a deciding leg as well - Part almost completed a 125 checkout, missing the double 20 to save the match before Davis hit double 10 - the same double Part won his world championship on - to wrap up the win.

The final match of the night was a high quality affair with both Dutchman [[Co Stomp<U+00E9>]] and twenty-fourth seed [[Andy Jenkins]] averaging 93 and 94 respectively. Both players had defeated [[Phil Taylor]] in recent events - Stomp<U+00E9> in the final of the German Darts Championship and Jenkins in the group stages of the [[2008 Grand Slam of Darts]] - and Stomp<U+00E9> took the first set. A 120 checkout from the Englishman levelled the match but Stomp<U+00E9>, himself a newcomer to the PDC this year, hit a 164 checkout - the highest of the tournament - to help him take the third set. The debutant won the final set 3-1 to win the match by the same scoreline, sending the 2007 semi-finalist Jenkins out. This result also meant all four seeds in action had crashed out.

The afternoon session of the second day of the World Championship opened with fifth seed [[Terry Jenkins]] taking on [[Dennis Smith (darts player)|Dennis Smith]] who was returning to the event after a two year absence. Jenkins had lost in the first round the previous year to 500-1 outsider [[Kirk Shepherd]], who would then go on to reach the final. His woes at the [[Alexandra Palace]] continued as Smith took a comfortable 3-1 victory. Smith took the first two sets before Jenkins looked to stage a comeback with 118 and 107 checkouts helping him take third set 3-0. However, 'Smiffy' put a stop to the resurgence with an 84 checkout on the bull to win the match, meaning all five seeds who had played so far had fallen at the first hurdle.

This was followed by a preliminary round match of considerably better quality than the previous night's. Austrian [[Hannes Schnier]], making his debut in the event, and China's [[Shi Yongsheng]], making a third consecutive appearance, faced off with Yongsheng taking an early lead. Two 180s helped Schnier to take a 4-3 lead before Yongsheng reeled off three legs in succession to take the match 6-4.

Arguably the match of the tournament so far followed as seventeenth seed and semi-finalist last year, [[Kevin Painter]], took on [[Matt Clark (darts player)|Matt Clark]]. Clark took the first set 3-2 before Painter hit back taking the second 3-1. 'The Artist' then seemed to gain momentum as he took the next set without reply, including a 100 checkout with two double tops and a 126 checkout on the bull, however 'Superman' Clark comfortably won the next set 3-1 to send the match into a decider. The final set had to be won by two clear legs but no player could open up such a margin as they each held their throw for ten straight legs to send the match into a [[sudden death (sport)|sudden death]] leg, something that Painter had famously been on the wrong end of in the [[2004 PDC World Darts Championship|2004 final]]. Clark won the bull, meaning he threw first, but heavy scoring from Painter meant he was first to a double - he missed one dart at double 16 for the match with Clark left on a 104 checkout. Clark got the required treble 20 but himself missed a dart at double 12 to win the contest. Painter then hit double 8 with his third dart to finally take victory and become the first seed to advance into the second round.

[[Dennis Priestley]], the eleventh seed, had a considerably more comfortable victory against Warren French of New Zealand. French played far better than in his preliminary round game, averaging 76 rather than 54, however Priestley's average of 87 told all as he took all three sets 3-1 for a 3-0 overall victory. Welshman and twenty-ninth seed [[Barrie Bates]] had a similarly easy victory over Northern Ireland's [[Felix McBrearty]], dropping three legs before a 101 checkout gave him a 3-0 win to end the afternoon session.

The evening session opened with ninth seed [[Alan Tabern]] producing a comfortable 3-0 victory over [[1996 BDO World Darts Championship|1996 BDO World Champion]] [[Steve Beaton]]. Tabern's average of 91 to Beaton's 82 was the decisive factor in the match as Beaton only won three legs in his defeat to the 2007 quarter-finalist. This was followed by a third preliminary game, easily the highest quality of the round so far as both the USA's [[David Fatum]], a semi-finalist in the [[2008 US Open Darts|2008 US Open]], and Ireland's [[Shane O'Connor (darts player)|Shane O'Connor]] produced averages of above 75. Fatum led 4-2 before missing seven match darts to let O'Connor peg the match back to 4-4, however Fatum made no mistake in taking the next two legs and the match.

Another player from the USA and the highest ranked on the North American Order of Merit, [[Darin Young]], took on Dutch youngster and thirty-second seed [[Michael van Gerwen]] in the next match. Young opened with heavy scoring and took the first set before van Gerwen took the next including a 104 checkout that gave the Netherlands player a burst of momentum - he only dropped one leg in taking the next two sets to win the match.

Thirteen-time World Champion and top seed [[Phil Taylor]] opened his campaign with a dominant victory over debutant [[Steve Grubb]]. Taylor, with a 96 average - the highest of the tournament so far - was never pushed and didn't drop a leg in a whitewash of the qualifier that acted as a warning shot to the rest of the competition. The final match of the day saw twenty-eighth seed [[Alex Roy (darts player)|Alex Roy]] meet fast-rising youngster [[Kevin McDine]]. McDine took the first set 3-2 and the second 3-1 - a 100 checkout and seven perfect darts in two separate legs helping the Geordie take the latter. Roy seemed to come alive as he took the third set without reply along with a 116 checkout, but McDine included a 108 finish in taking the fourth and final set 3-1 to secure the match, and finish off day two's action.

===Day Three, Sunday 21 December===
====Preliminary Round====
:Charles Losper 6-4 Sudesh Fitzgerald
:Remco van Eijden 5-3 Anastasia Dobromyslova

====First Round====
:Mark Walsh 3-2 Jamie Caven (3-2, 2-3, 3-2, 2-3, 4-2)
:Mark Dudbridge 3-2 Nick Fullwell (2-3, 3-1, 3-0, 1-3, 4-2)
:Wes Newton 3-1 Per Laursen (2-3, 3-2, 3-1, 3-2)
:Denis Ovens 3-0 Steve Maish (3-1, 3-2, 3-0)
:Andy Hamilton 3-0 Michael Barnard (3-1, 3-1, 3-2)
:Wayne Mardle 3-0 David Fatum (3-0, 3-1, 3-0)
:Raymond van Barneveld 3-0 Mark Stephenson (3-0, 3-0, 3-2)
:Peter Manley 2-3 Mensur Suljovic (3-1, 2-3, 1-3, 3-0, 1-3)

The first match of the third day was a tight affair between twenty-first seed [[Mark Walsh (darts player)|Mark Walsh]] and [[Jamie Caven]]. Both were second round losers last year and both averaged 91 in a match where the first break of throw was not until the third set. At 1-1 in sets, Walsh had eight perfect darts towards a [[nine dart finish]] but his dart at double 12 fell well short. The following leg he broke Caven's throw and despite a break back from Caven, a 120 checkout saw him take the third set. Caven took the fourth set 3-2 but Walsh, who two years ago went out in the first round with a 71 average due to suffering from [[dartitis]], took the final set 4-2 to go into the second round. The match eventually ended up with a total thirteen 180s between the players; eight were from Walsh which would set a joint-record for the first round along with [[Adrian Lewis]].

The next match saw the second best performance from a preliminary round entrant in South Africa's [[Charles Losper]], who faced Guyana's [[Sudesh Fitzgerald]]. Losper, who twelve months ago lost 3-1 in the first round to eventual champion [[John Part]], averaged 87 in a tidy 6-4 victory over Fitzgerald, making his debut at the World Championship. Fitzgerald started poorly and let Losper take a 3-1 lead, before a 64 finish helped him level the match. Losper then checked out 95 to retake the lead, but despite Fitzgerald hitting back the next leg, a 180 in the ninth leg and a 14 dart finish in the tenth gave Losper victory.

The [[2005 PDC World Darts Championship|2005]] runner-up and twentieth seed [[Mark Dudbridge]] was next in action against debutant [[Nick Fullwell]] in a match that also went to a fifth set. Dudbridge led in the first, but missed doubles let Fullwell steal it before 'Flash' Dudbridge took the next set 3-1 including a 100 checkout. Dudbridge took control of the match by taking the third set without reply, but 'Hero' Fullwell hit a 98 finish in the fourth to send the match into a decider. Dudbridge finally prevailed by taking the fourth set 4-2.

Thirty-first seed Englishman [[Wes Newton]] faced off against Danish [[Per Laursen]] in the next match. Both suffered first round exits last year and Laursen was condemned to the same fate in a fairly unremarkable match in which both players averaged in the 80s. Laursen took the first set 3-2 but Newton won the next by the same scoreline, before taking the lead with a 3-1 score in the third set (the only set that didn't go to a deciding leg) and finishing the match off with double 4 in the fourth set's decider. A fairly one-sided match followed as eighteenth seed [[Denis Ovens]] took a comfortable victory over [[Steve Maish]]. Ovens took the first set 3-1 and a tight second set which Ovens won 3-2 with a 15 darter seemed to break Maish's resolve, as finishes of 80 and 120 helped Ovens take the third set without reply to end the afternoon's action.

The evening opened with some heavy scoring from number seven seed [[Andy Hamilton (darts player)|Andy Hamilton]], who set the best average of round one (101.59) in a straight sets victory over [[Michael Barnard (darts player)|Michael Barnard]]. Barnard did not disgrace himself, averaging 93 and performing 114 checkout, but Hamilton's power play including five 180s ensured he went through while throwing down the gauntlet for the rest of the field.

What followed was one of the most hotly anticipated matches ever in the [[PDC World Darts Championship|PDC World Championship]]. Massive hype had gathered over the appearance of Russian [[Anastasia Dobromyslova]], the Ladies World Champion, facing off against Dutchman [[Remco van Eijden]] in a preliminary round game. Both were making their debut in the PDC World Championship and both had been awarded a [[wild card (sports)|wild card]] into the competition. However, Dobromyslova was the clear crowd favourite and the pressure showed on van Eijden as he lost the first leg. This seemed to awaken the Dutchman as he reeled off the next three legs before a thirteen darter helped the Russian to level the match. van Eijden then took the next two legs to win the match and end the dream for Dobromyslova, though both players averaged over 80 in arguably the highest quality preliminary round match so far.

Crowd favourite and eighth seed [[Wayne Mardle]] then began his World Championship campaign against debutant American [[David Fatum]]. The four-time (including last year) semi-finalist did not play his best game, averaging 86 to Fatum's 81, but it was enough to put him through in straight sets, dropping only one leg in the process. While his scoring was nothing to write home about, Mardle's finishing was eye-catching, including a 116 and 106 checkout in a clinical performance on the doubles - it was this part of his game that put 'Hawaii 501' through comfortably as 'The Scorpion' Fatum struggled in finishing off legs.

The [[2007 PDC World Darts Championship|2007]] champion and second seed [[Raymond van Barneveld]] began his challenge for the championship against English qualifier [[Mark Stephenson]]. 'Barney', a third round loser last year, was hoping to outdo both Hamilton's average and Taylor's record of not dropping a leg, and, in taking the first two sets 3-0 he looked to be doing just that. van Barneveld included a 13 darter and two 14 dart finishes in rapidly taking the first set, and a 102 finish was crucial in taking the second. However, his third set was less comfortable, as Stephenson gained his first leg with a 126 checkout and then sent the set into a deciding leg. Stephenson, averaging a respectable 88, missed a dart to take the set before 'The Man' wrapped up the game, averaging a strong 100.80 in the process.

The final match of the day saw another upset as thirteenth seed [[Peter Manley]] fell in a deciding set to Serbian-born Austrian [[Mensur Suljovic]]. Manley, a three-time runner-up at the PDC World Championship, took the first set with ease including a 124 checkout. He then led 2-0 in the second set before Suljovic began to hit back, with two 180s helping him take three legs on the spin to level the match 1-1. Suljovic, a second round loser to eventual champion John Part last year, led for the first time in the third set, before 'One Dart' hit a clinical 118 checkout to put him back in the game. However, his scoring was not up to par as Suljovic continued to outperform him in that area, and a 101 checkout helped him take third set 3-1. Manley, sensing a defeat, quickly took the next set 3-0 to send the match into a decider. However, it was Suljovic (averaging an impressive 91 to Manley's 88) whose nerve held when it mattered most as he broke his opponent's throw early and double ten sent Manley crashing out.

===Day Four, Monday 22 December===
====Preliminary Round====
:Marko Kantele 5-2 Lourence Ilagan

====First Round====
:Chris Mason 0-3 John MaGowan (1-3, 1-3, 1-3)
:Adrian Lewis 3-1 Russell Stewart (3-1, 2-3, 3-1, 3-1)
:Colin Lloyd 0-3 Jelle Klaasen (1-3, 0-3, 0-3)
:Mervyn King 3-0 Shi Yongsheng (3-0, 3-0, 3-0)

The fourth day only featured play in the evening, and began with a major upset as twenty-second seed [[Chris Mason (darts player)|Chris Mason]] fell in straight sets to 67 year-old Irishman [[John MaGowan]]. Mason never got going in the match, averaging 83 to MaGowan's 92. All sets went 3-1 in 'Mr Magoo's favour, with the highlight of the match being a 156 checkout from MaGowan in the final set to end Mason's hopes of a recovery - double 4 finally completed a major surprise in the opening game of the night. In the preliminary round game that followed, Finland's [[Marko Kantele]] produced the best performance of the preliminary stage with an average of 89 to win 5-2 against [[Lourence Ilagan]] of the Philippines. Both were debutants though it was the Finn who settled in earlier, completing a 120 checkout before a 12 darter put him 2-0 up. Ilagan won two more legs but Kantele was always in control and a 60 checkout completed the final preliminary round match.

Sixth seed young gun [[Adrian Lewis]], twice a quarter-finalist at the World Championship, entered the tournament facing off against veteran Australian [[Russell Stewart]] who was making his debut at the PDC version of the event despite making eleven appearances in the [[BDO World Darts Championship|BDO World Championship]]. Lewis stormed through the first set, including three 180s and a 121 finish to complete a 12 darter to take the set. A 111 finish helped him open up the first set 2-0 as the youngster looked to have the match under control, but a sudden loss in form from Lewis and steady scoring from Stewart helped 'Rusty' take three legs on the trot to level the match. Stewart took the first leg of the next set to take the lead from the first time, but 'Jackpot' started to find form again as he punished missed darts at doubles from the Australian to take the third set 3-1. A 105 checkout sealed the match for Lewis in the fourth set - though he only averaged 86 to Stewart's 84, Lewis did hit eight 180s in the match, the most of the round and equalling [[Mark Walsh (darts player)|Mark Walsh's]] record.

The next match was hyped before the tournament as the match of the first round, however it proved to be anything but as [[2006 BDO World Darts Championship|2006 BDO World Champion]] [[Jelle Klaasen]] dropped only one leg in a clinical demolition of tenth seed [[Colin Lloyd]]. Both were first round losers last year, and both had had darts to win their matches (Klaasen had missed ten match darts to put away [[Vincent van der Voort]]), but Klaasen made no mistake in that area this time as he won the last two sets 3-0 against a disappointing Lloyd - 'Jaws' averaged 86 to 'The Matador's impressive 95. The last match of the night was another one-sided affair as twelfth seed [[Mervyn King (darts player)|Mervyn King]] didn't drop a leg against China's [[Shi Yongsheng]]. The averages - King with 92 to Yongsheng's 75 - told all as a 105 checkout was the only real highlight in a match dominated by 'The King'.

===Day Five, Tuesday 23 December===
* The eight remaining first round matches.
:Andy Smith 2-3 Tony Ayres (2-3, 3-2, 2-3, 3-2, 1-3)
:Adrian Gray 0-3 Paul Nicholson (0-3, 0-3, 0-3)
:Kirk Shepherd 2-3 Jan van der Rassel (2-3, 3-1, 2-3, 3-0, 2-4)
:Tony Eccles 3-2 Remco van Eijden (3-0, 3-2, 2-3, 2-3, 3-1)
:Ronnie Baxter 3-1 Marko Kantele (2-3, 3-2, 3-0, 3-1)
:Colin Osborne 3-0 Charles Losper (3-0, 3-1, 3-2)
:James Wade 3-0 Brendan Dolan (3-2, 3-0, 3-1)
:Vincent van der Voort 3-0 N<U+00E1>ndor Bezzeg (3-2, 3-1, 3-0)

The last day of play before the [[Christmas]] break featured eight round one games to finish up the first round. First up was twenty-sixth seed [[Andy Smith (darts player)|Andy Smith]], a first round loser last year, taking on debutant [[Tony Ayres (darts player)|Tony Ayres]]. Ayres took the first set before 'The Pieman' Smith changed gears, hitting two 180s and a thirteen darter to take the second set. An even contest saw Ayres take the third with finishes of 116 and 101 but Smith took the fourth including a 155 checkout. In the deciding set, Ayres quickly took a 2-0 lead before Smith hit a 100 checkout with two double tops to save the game; it was only delaying the inevitable however as Ayres, who hit three 180s to Smith's six, and averaged 86 to Smith's 87, was on target when it mattered - he hit double four cleanly in the next leg to win the match.

The next match was an unexpected demolition of twenty-seventh seed [[Adrian Gray]], who did not win a leg in a whitewash defeat by top Australian player [[Paul Nicholson (darts player)|Paul Nicholson]]. Gray only got one dart at a double in the entire match as his average of 84 was blown away by Nicholson's 96 (interestingly Nicholson averaged exactly the same as [[Phil Taylor]], who did not drop a leg in his first round match either). Though Nicholson did not hit any 180s, he did hit showpiece checkouts of 142 and 100 to set up a match with [[Adrian Lewis]] in the second round, who had beaten his fellow Australian [[Russell Stewart]] the previous day.

Twenty-third seed [[Kirk Shepherd]] was not to have a repeat of his fairytale run to the final in last year's [[2008 PDC World Darts Championship|2008 event]] as he was defeated in a deciding set by Dutchman [[Jan van der Rassel]]. A 106 checkout helped Shepherd lead in the first set, but clean checkouts of 98 and 97 in two consecutive legs ensured that van der Rassel took the first set. Shepherd took the second set 3-1 before the third set went to a deciding leg - 'Rassel Dazzle' held throw to go 2-1 up. The 'Martial Dartist' Shepherd stormed through the fourth set, finishing it with a 126 checkout on the bull, but he could not keep up the momentum as van der Rassel took the final set by two clear legs with a clean 106 checkout. Shepherd's defeat also meant that both finalists from the previous year's tournament had gone out in the first round, the first time this has ever happened.

The final game of the afternoon also went to a deciding set though it did not look to be at first as thirtieth seed [[Tony Eccles]] shot to a 2-0 in sets lead against [[Remco van Eijden]], the conqueror of Ladies World Champion [[Anastasia Dobromyslova]] in the preliminary round. Eccles included a 164 checkout in the first set, which he won 3-0, and though the second set was closer in going to a deciding leg, Eccles came out on top to give himself a strong lead. However, the match was far from over as van Eijden took the third set in a deciding leg with a gutsy 116 checkout, and in the deciding leg of the fourth Eccles missed five darts for the match before van Eijden levelled the match. 'The Viper' Eccles lost the first leg in the deciding set as van Eijden took the lead for the first time, but this provoked him into heavy scoring as he won the next three legs without reply to finally win the match.

The evening's play saw fifteenth seed [[Ronnie Baxter]] take on the best performer of the preliminary round - Finn [[Marko Kantele]]. Kantele took the first set with some eye-catching finishing, hitting checkouts of 124 and 164 both on the bull to carve himself a lead despite superior scoring from Baxter. Though Kantele again finished on the bull with a 122 checkout in the second set, Baxter held his throw under pressure to level the match. From then Baxter only lost one leg in the next two sets as he started to hit good form and Kantele's started to slip away - 'The Rocket' stormed through the third set without dropping a leg and he took the fourth, and the match, with some eye-catching finishing of his own, hitting two double tops to complete a 100 checkout. Baxter's end average of 92 to Kantele's 83 showed that it was his scoring that gave him the edge in the match despite some amazing finishing from the Finn.

The fourteenth seed [[Colin Osborne]], a quarter-finalist in 2007 but a first round loser last year, opened his campaign with a clinical straight-sets victory over South African [[Charles Losper]]. Osborne rivalled Kantele's finishing as a 121 checkout helped him take the first set without reply, and a 167 checkout - the highest of the first round - was instrumental in opening a lead in the second set, which he later won with a 110 finish. Losper, now with his back to the wall, appeared to gain steam as a 14 darter gave him a two leg advantage in the third set, but Osborne regrouped and a 96 checkout gave him victory in the deciding leg of the set. 'The Wizard' Osborne's average of 95 to complement his finishing also showed that he was very much a threat following the disappointment of last year.

[[Brendan Dolan]] gave third seed [[James Wade]] a great scare in the first set of their match - he missed six darts for the set before an under-par Wade, who averaged 88, hit an important 106 checkout to take it and break Dolan's spirit. From then on Wade took six of the next seven legs in winning the following two sets and won the match with a thirteen dart finish to set up a match with Tony Eccles, who had famously knocked Wade out in the first round of the [[2008 World Grand Prix Darts|2008 World Grand Prix]] as 'The Machine' was the defending champion at the time. The next match was another straight-sets victory for a seed - nineteenth seed [[Vincent van der Voort]] won the final first round match 3-0 against Hungarian [[N<U+00E1>ndor Bezzeg]]. The first set went to a deciding leg but van der Voort took it under pressure, and like Wade he dropped only one leg in taking the next two sets - a 106 checkout, five 180s, and a 90 average from 'Greased Lightning' proved enough to dispatch the Eastern European qualifier and end the first round.

:Wayne Mardle 4-3 Robert Thornton (1-3, 3-1, 3-1, 3-2, 1-3, 2-3, 3-1)

The tournament resumed and the second round began on day six, which opened with a remarkable match between old PDC stalwart [[Dennis Smith (darts player)|Dennis Smith]] and young [[Kevin McDine]]. In the deciding leg of the first set, Smith missed darts to take the opener so McDine stepped in to take it. The second set also went to a decider, and McDine performed an 11 dart finish to open up a 2-0 lead. Checkouts of 110 and 128 on the bull put McDine 3-0 up and on course for a comfortable victory, but Smith rallied in the fourth and began to hit top form as he broke McDine's throw for the first time in the match to win the set. Two fourteen darters and a fifteen dart finish ensured that Smith continued his resurgence in the fifth set, and he levelled the match in the deciding leg of the sixth set. Smith then led for the first time in the match as he took the opening leg of the deciding set, and he repeated McDine's feat of a 128 checkout on the bull to go 2-0 up. From here there was only going to be one winner as Smith landed double eight to complete a famous comeback. Remarkably, Smith hit thirty-one 140s (the most from one player in a single match) but no 180s, compared to McDine's statistic of fifteen 140s and eight 180s. Both players averaged above 90 in a match that would go down as a classic.

====Nine dart finish====
During the second leg of the sixth set of the match between van Barneveld and Klaasen, van Barneveld threw the first-ever [[nine dart finish]] at a [[PDC World Darts Championship]] since the split from the [[British Darts Organisation]] in mid-1993, and only the second World Championship nine-darter (first live) after [[Paul Lim]]'s similar outshot against [[Jack McKenna]] in [[1990 BDO World Darts Championship|1990]].

Third place went to the Serbian-born Austrian [[Mensur Suljovic]].<ref name="ladbrokesfield" />

Of the four qualifiers, three had played in the [[2008 PDC World Darts Championship]], with Stomp<U+00E9> being the only debutant having joined the PDC in June.<ref>{{cite web

'''Philippines qualifier'''

As a result, on 30 November 2008, [[Remco van Eijden]] was offered and accepted the wildcard, a decision which led to his expulsion from the 2008 Zuiderduin Masters to be replaced by fellow Dutchman and [[2009 BDO World Darts Championship|2009 BDO World Championship]] qualifier [[Willy van de Wiel]].<ref name="ladbrokesfield" /><ref>{{cite web
