'''''Anime from Akira to Princess Mononoke: Experiencing Contemporary Japanese Animation''''' is a scholarly book which uses techniques of [[literary criticism]] on anime by [[Susan Joliffe Napier]] published in 2001 by [[Palgrave Macmillan]]. It discusses themes of [[sh<U+014D>jo]], [[hentai]], [[mecha]], [[magical girlfriend]] and [[magical girl]] anime using select titles. It also discusses some aspects of the English-speaking [[otaku|anime fandom]].  The book has been translated into Japanese, and had four editions,<ref>[http://www.utexas.edu/features/archive/2004/anime.html UT Feature Story - An Anime Explosion: Challenging themes, complex characters make Japanese animation a global phenomenon<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> before a revised fifth edition was published in 2005 as '''''Anime from Akira to Howl's Moving Castle: Experiencing Contemporary Japanese Animation'''''.  

==Contents==
The book uses literary criticism to discuss themes and ideas present in select anime titles and attempts to categorise anime into three types - apocalyptic, festival, and [[wikt:elegiac|elegaic]]. 
The book is split into five sections. In the first, Napier asks why anime is important as a topic of study.  In the second, Napier looks at the representation of the human body in anime, looking at "monstrous adolescents", pornographic anime and cyborgs.  In the third, Napier looks at representations of females, the [[girl]], the magical girl and magical girlfriends.  In the fourth section, Napier examines historical-themed anime.

The "monstrous adolescent" is often a quick-tempered or psychologically disturbed child with remarkable and world-changing powers, which were usually a result of scientific experiments, revolutionary technology, or human-caused pollution.  These children have the power to improve or alter the world , but because of their personality the child is often on the verge of destroying it completely.  The source of this create/destroy idea is usually traced back to the effects of [[Hiroshima]] and the capabilities of nuclear power and atomic bombs. The theme of the "monstrous adolescent" explores  society's fears of ever-growing technology, the rebellious actions of children, and the apocalyptic scenarios that are suggested by combining these two themes.

Titles discussed in the book include [[Grave of the Fireflies]], [[Ranma 1/2]], [[Akira (film)|Akira]], [[Neon Genesis Evangelion]], [[Ghost in the Shell]], the [[Oh My Goddess]] OVAs, [[Bubblegum Crisis]], [[Legend of the Overfiend]], [[Sailor Moon]], [[Video Girl Ai]], [[Urusei Yatsura]], [[Cutie Honey]], [[La Blue Girl]], [[Wicked City]], [[Twin Dolls]], the works of [[Hayao Miyazaki]],  [[Serial Experiments Lain]] and [[Revolutionary Girl Utena]].
