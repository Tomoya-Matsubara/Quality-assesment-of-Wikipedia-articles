'''USS ''Indiana'' (Battleship No. 1)''' was the lead ship of her [[Indiana class battleship|class]] and the first [[United States Navy]] [[battleship]] equivalent to European designs of the time. Authorized in 1890 and commissioned five years later, she was a relatively small battleship with heavy armor and ordnance that pioneered the use of an [[Pre-dreadnought battleship#Armament|intermediate battery]]. Specifically intended for [[Coastal defence and fortification|coastal defense]], her [[freeboard (nautical)|freeboard]] was too low in the water to deal well with the waves of the open ocean and she also suffered from several design flaws.

''Indiana'' served in the [[Spanish<U+2013>American War]] as part of the [[North Atlantic Squadron]], taking part in the blockade related to the [[Battle of Santiago de Cuba]]. Although unable to join the chase of the Spanish [[cruiser]]s, she was partly responsible for the destruction of the Spanish [[destroyer]]s [[Spanish destroyer Pluton|''Pluton'']] and [[Spanish destroyer Furor|''Furor'']]. After the war she became quickly obsolete<U+2014>despite several modernizations<U+2014>and spent most of her time in commission as a [[training ship]] or in the [[reserve fleet]], with her last commission  during [[World War I]] as training ship for gun crews. She decommissioned for the third and final time in January 1919 and was shortly after reclassified ''Coast Battleship Number 1'' so that the name ''Indiana'' could be reused. She was sunk as a target in underwater explosion and aerial bombing tests in 1920 and her hulk was sold for scrap.

==Design and construction==
{{Main|Indiana class battleship}}
''Indiana'' and her sister ships [[USS Massachusetts (BB-2)|''Massachusetts'']] and [[USS Oregon (BB-3)|''Oregon'']] were based on a modified version of a design for a short range battleship drawn up by a policy board in 1889. At the time [[United States Congress]] held the view that battleships should be coastline defenders rather than oceangoing long range battleships, because the latter were associated with [[Imperialism]].<ref name=F2425>Friedman, ''U.S. Battleships'', p. 24<U+2013>25.</ref> This design view was reflected in their moderate endurance, relatively small [[Displacement (ship)|displacement]] and low freeboard, which limited sea going capability.<ref name="G121">Gardiner, ''Steam, Steel & Shellfire: The Steam Warship 1815<U+2013>1905'', p. 121.</ref> They were however heavily armed and armored, so much in fact that ''Conway's All The Worlds Fighting Ships'' describes them as "attempting too much on a very limited displacement."<ref name=C140>

The ships had a main battery of four 13-inch (330&nbsp;mm) guns, an intermediate battery of eight 8-inch (200&nbsp;mm) guns and a secondary battery of four 6-inch (150&nbsp;mm) guns, twenty [[QF 6 pounder Hotchkiss|Hotchkiss 6-pounders]], and six [[QF 1 pounder pom-pom|Maxim-Nordenfelt 1-pounders]], as well as four<ref group=note name=torpedo/> 18-inch (460&nbsp;mm) [[British 18 inch torpedo|Whitehead torpedo]] tubes.<ref>Reilly & Scheina, ''American Battleships 1886<U+2013>1923'', p. 54-55.</ref> The main battery was placed in two centerline turrets fore and aft, while the intermediate battery was placed on four wing turrets on the superstructure. Because the turrets were not centrally balanced, they caused the ship to list when aimed broadside. During later modernizations counterweights and several other improvements were added,<ref name=RS62>Reilly & Scheina, ''American Battleships 1886<U+2013>1923'', p. 62.</ref> but the gun mountings never performed in an entirely satisfactory manner.<ref name="G121"/>

''Indiana'''s armor consisted mostly of&mdash;what was at the time&mdash;modern [[Harvey armor]]. Its main protection was a 18-inch (460&nbsp;mm) [[armor belt]] protecting the waterline of the central citadel. The hull above this belt and deck had a few inches of armor and below the belt the ship had a double bottom. On the ends the belt connected via armored bulkheads to the main [[barbette]]s, which were 17&nbsp;inches (430&nbsp;mm) thick and the main turrets above them had 15&nbsp;inches (380&nbsp;mm) of vertical plating. Armor for the 8-inch turrets and barbettes was less than half as thick and the hollow [[conning tower]] was 10&nbsp;inches (250&nbsp;mm) of nickel steel.<ref name=RSnote>Reilly & Scheina, ''American Battleships 1886<U+2013>1923'', pp. 56, 58 & 68.</ref> The main armor belt was placed relatively low, causing it to be completely submerged when the ship was loaded with the maximum amount of coal and supplies and making it effectively useless.<ref>Friedman, ''U.S. Battleships'', p. 29.</ref>

Two vertical inverted [[triple expansion]] [[reciprocating steam engine]]s, powered by four [[Scotch marine boiler#Double-ended|double ended Scotch boilers]], produced {{convert|9700|ihp|kW|abbr=on|lk=on}}. ''Indiana'''s maximum speed was {{convert|15.5|knots|km/h mph}}, slightly above her design speed of {{convert|15|knots|km/h mph}}.<ref name=RS5868>Reilly & Scheina, ''American Battleships 1886<U+2013>1923'', pp. 58 & 68.</ref> The boilers were later replaced by eight [[Babcock & Wilcox boiler]]s.<ref name="RS62"/>

In late 1896, both main turrets broke loose from their clamps in heavy seas. Because the turrets were not centrally balanced, they swung from side to side with the motion of the ship, until they were secured with heavy ropes. Heavier clamps were installed, but in February 1896, while conducting fleet maneuvers with the North Atlantic squadron, the ''Indiana'' encountered more bad weather and started rolling heavily. Her new captain, [[Henry Clay Taylor]], promptly ordered her back to port for fear the clamps would break again.<ref name=RS59>Reilly & Scheina, ''American Battleships 1886<U+2013>1923'', p. 59.</ref> This convinced the navy that [[bilge keels]]<U+2014>omitted during construction because the ship would no longer fit in most American dry docks<U+2014>were necessary to reduce the rolling,<ref>

On 31 January 1919, she was decommissioned for the final time and two months later she was renamed ''Coast Battleship Number 1'' so that the name ''Indiana'' could be assigned to the newly authorized<U+2014>but never completed<U+2014>battleship {{USS|Indiana|BB-50}}.<ref name=DANFS1/>
The old battleship was brought to shallow waters in [[Chesapeake Bay]] near the wreck of the [[USS Texas (1892)|''Texas'']] and used to test the effect of underwater explosions on her double bottom and watertight compartments in November 1920. She was also used for target practice by navy airplanes.<ref name=RS62/> On 19 March 1924, her hulk was sold for scrap.<ref name=DANFS1/>
