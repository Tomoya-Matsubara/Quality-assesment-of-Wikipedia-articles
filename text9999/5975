'''Savile Row''' (pronounced {{IPAc-en|<U+02CC>|s|<U+00E6>|v|<U+026A>|l|_|<U+02C8>|r|o<U+028A>}}) is a street in [[Mayfair]], [[central London]]. Known principally for its traditional [[Savile Row tailoring|bespoke tailoring]] for men, where customers have included [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Lord Nelson]], [[Winston Churchill]], and [[Jude Law]],<ref name="NYT"/> the street has had a varied history which has included accommodating the headquarters of the [[Royal Geographical Society]] at 1 Savile Row, where significant British explorations to Africa and the South Pole were planned; and more recently, the [[Apple Corps|Apple]] office of [[the Beatles]] at 3 Savile Row, where the band's final live performance, later shown in the film ''[[Let It Be (film)|Let It Be]]'', was held on the roof of the building. 

Originally named Savile Street, it was built between 1731 and 1735 as part of the development of the [[Burlington Estate]]. It was designed under the influence of Burlington's interpretation of [[Palladian architecture]], known as "Burlingtonian". [[Henry Flitcroft]], under the supervision of [[Daniel Garrett]], appears to have been the main architect <U+2013> though 1 and 22<U+2013>23 Savile Row were designed by [[William Kent]]. Initially, the street was occupied mainly by military officers and their wives; later [[William Pitt the Younger]] and Irish-born playwright and MP, [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan]] were residents. Tailors started to appear in the area in the late 18th century; first in [[Cork Street]], about 1790, then by 1803 in Savile Row itself. In 1846, [[Henry Poole & Co|Henry Poole]], later credited as the creator of the dinner jacket or tuxedo, opened an entrance to his tailoring premises at 32 Savile Row.<ref name="NYT"/> In 1969, [[Nutters of Savile Row]] modernised the style and approach of traditional [[Savile Row tailoring]]; a modernisation that continued in the 1990s with the arrival of designers like [[Richard James (tailor)|Richard James]], [[Ozwald Boateng]] and [[Timothy Everest]]. Traditional hand made bespoke suits, as of 2012, cost upwards of <U+00A3>2,000. The term "bespoke" as applied to fine tailoring is understood to have originated in Savile Row, and came to mean a suit cut and made by hand; though, after a ruling by the [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]] in 2008, modern bespoke suits may be made more cheaply by machine, as long as they are still "made to measure".

Savile Row runs parallel to [[Regent Street]] between Conduit Street at the northern end and Vigo Street at the southern. Linking roads include Burlington Place, Clifford Street and Burlington Gardens. The freehold is owned by the Pollen Estate, who work in partnership with [[Westminster City Council]] to protect the street's tailoring heritage under the Savile Row SPA (Special Policy Area).

The first house in what would become Savile Row was "a fine House and Ground",<ref>{{cite book |last=Strype |first=John |title=A Survey of the Cities of London and Westminster |publisher=T.
