The Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Faith was founded by [[Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h]] in 19th-century [[Persia]].  Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h was exiled for his teachings, from Persia to the [[Ottoman Empire]], and died while officially being a prisoner.  After Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h's death, under the leadership of his son, [[`Abdu'l-Bah<U+00E1>]], the religion spread from its Persian and Ottoman roots, and gained a footing in Europe and America, and was consolidated in Iran, where it suffers intense [[Persecution of Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s|persecution]].<ref name="affolter">{{cite journal |last=Affolter |first=Friedrich W. |year=2005 |month=January |title=The Specter of Ideological Genocide: The Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s of Iran |journal=War Crimes, Genocide, & Crimes against Humanity |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=75<U+2013>114 |url=http://www.altoona.psu.edu/journals/war-crimes/articles/V1/v1n1a3.pdf |accessdate=May 31, 2006 |archiveurl=http://wayback.archive.org/web/20120722083412/http://www.altoona.psu.edu/journals/war-crimes/articles/V1/v1n1a3.pdf |archivedate= July 22, 2012 |format=PDF}}</ref> After the death of `Abdu'l-Bah<U+00E1>, the leadership of the Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> community entered a new phase, evolving from a single individual to an administrative order with both elected bodies and appointed individuals.<ref name="PSmith56">{{Harvnb|Smith|2008|p=56}}</ref>  There are probably more than 5 million Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s around the world in more than 200 countries and territories.<ref name="eor">{{Harvnb|Hutter|2005|pp=737<U+2013>40}}</ref><ref name="statistics">[[Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> statistics#Worldwide figures|Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> statistics]] for a breakdown of different estimates.</ref>

In the Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Faith, religious history is seen to have unfolded through a series of divine messengers, each of whom established a religion that was suited to the needs of the time and the capacity of the people. These messengers have included [[Abrahamic]] figures as well as [[Dharmic]] ones - [[Krishna]], [[Moses]], [[Buddha]], [[Jesus]], [[Muhammad]], and others. For Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s, the most recent messengers are the [[B<U+00E1>b]] and [[Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h]]. In Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> belief, each consecutive messenger prophesied of messengers to follow, and Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h's life and teachings fulfilled the [[eschatology|end-time]] promises of previous scriptures. Humanity is understood to be in a process of collective evolution, and the need of the present time is for the gradual establishment of peace, justice and unity on a global scale.<ref name = "PSmith107">{{Harvnb|Smith|2008|pp=107<U+2013>9}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The word ''Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED><U+202F>'' is used either as an adjective to refer to the Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Faith or as a term for a follower of Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h. The word is not a noun meaning the religion as a whole.<ref>{{Harvnb|Stockman|2006|p=209}}</ref> It is derived from the Arabic ''[[Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> symbols#The Greatest Name|Bah<U+00E1>'<U+202F>]]'' ({{lang|ar|<U+0628><U+0647><U+0627><U+0621>}}), meaning "glory" or "splendor".<ref>Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s prefer the orthographies ''Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED><U+202F>'', ''Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s'', ''the B<U+00E1>b'', ''Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h'', and ''`Abdu'l-Bah<U+00E1><U+202F>'', using a [[Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> orthography|particular transcription]] of the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]] in publications. "Bahai", "Bahais", "Baha'i", "the Bab", "Bahaullah" and "Baha'u'llah" are often used when diacriticals are unavailable.</ref> The term "Bahaism" (or "Baha'ism") has been used in the past, but the generally accepted name for the religion is the Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Faith.<ref>{{Harvnb |Hatcher|Martin|1998| pp = xiii}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | title = A Journalist's Guide to the Baha'i Faith | author = Centre for Faith and the Media | location = Calgary, Alberta | url = http://www.faithandmedia.org/cms/uploads/files/8_guide-bahai.pdf | publisher = Centre for Faith and the Media | page = 3 | archiveurl =http://wayback.archive.org/web/20120425091536/http://www.faithandmedia.org/cms/uploads/files/8_guide-bahai.pdf | archivedate = April 25, 2012}}</ref>

==Beliefs==
Three core principles establish a basis for Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> teachings and doctrine: the [[God in the Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Faith|unity of God]], the [[Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Faith and the unity of religion|unity of religion]], and the [[Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Faith and the unity of humanity|unity of humanity]].<ref name="eor" /> From these postulates stems the belief that God periodically reveals his will through divine messengers, whose purpose is to transform the character of humankind and develop, within those who respond, moral and spiritual qualities. Religion is thus seen as orderly, unified, and progressive from age to age.<ref name="PSmith108">{{Harvnb|Smith|2008|pp=108<U+2013>109}}</ref>

===God===
{{Main|God in the Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Faith}}
[[File:Bahaitemplesydney.JPG|thumb|upright|alt=A white domed building|Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Temple, Ingleside, Sydney, Australia]]
The Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> writings describe a single, personal, inaccessible, omniscient, omnipresent, imperishable, and almighty God who is the creator of all things in the universe.<ref name="PSmith106">{{Harvnb|Smith|2008|p=106}}</ref> The [[existence of God]] and the [[universe]] is thought to be eternal, without a beginning or end.<ref name="britannica">{{Harvnb|Britannica|1992}}</ref> Though inaccessible directly, God is nevertheless seen as conscious of creation, with a will and purpose that is expressed through messengers termed [[Manifestations of God]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Smith|2008|pp=106<U+2013>107}}</ref><ref name="PSmith111">{{Harvnb|Smith|2008|pp=111<U+2013>112}}</ref>

Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> teachings state that God is too great for humans to fully comprehend, or to create a complete and accurate image of, by themselves. Therefore, human understanding of God is achieved through his revelations via his Manifestations.<ref name="hatcher_huri">{{harvnb|Hatcher|2005|pp=1<U+2013>38}}</ref><ref name="manifestation">{{harvnb|Cole|1982|pp=1<U+2013>38}}</ref> In the Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> religion God is often referred to by titles and attributes (for example, the All-Powerful, or the All-Loving), and there is a substantial emphasis on [[monotheism]]; such doctrines as the [[Trinity]] are seen as compromising, if not contradicting, the Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> view that God is single and has no equal.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Jesus Christ in the Baha'i Writings | first = Robert | last = Stockman | journal = Baha'i Studies Review | volume= 2 | issue = 1 | url = http://bahai-library.com/stockman_jesus_bahai_writings | ref = harv}}</ref> The Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> teachings state that the attributes which are applied to God are used to translate Godliness into human terms and also to help individuals concentrate on their own attributes in worshipping God to develop their potentialities on their spiritual path.<ref name="hatcher_huri" /><ref name="manifestation" /> According to the Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> teachings the human purpose is to learn to know and love God through such methods as [[Prayer in the Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Faith|prayer]], [[Introspection|reflection]], and being of service to others.<ref name="hatcher_huri" />

===Religion===
{{Main|Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Faith and the unity of religion}}
{{See also|Progressive revelation (Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>)}}
Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> notions of progressive religious revelation result in their accepting the validity of most of the world's religions, whose founders and central figures are seen as Manifestations of God. Religious history is interpreted as a series of [[dispensationalism|dispensations]], where each ''manifestation'' brings a somewhat broader and more advanced [[revelation]], suited for the time and place in which it was expressed.<ref name="britannica" /> Specific religious social teachings (for example, the direction of prayer, or dietary restrictions) may be revoked by a subsequent manifestation so that a more appropriate requirement for the time and place may be established. Conversely, certain general principles (for example, neighbourliness, or charity) are seen to be universal and consistent. In Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> belief, this process of progressive revelation will not end; however, it is believed to be cyclical. Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s do not expect a new manifestation of God to appear within 1000 years of Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h's revelation.<ref>{{harvnb|McMullen|2000| |p=7}}</ref>

Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> beliefs are sometimes described as [[Syncretism|syncretic]] combinations of earlier religious beliefs.<ref>{{cite book | title = A Resource Guide for the Scholarly Study of the Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Faith | last = Stockman | first = Robert | chapter = The Baha'i Faith and Syncretism | year = 1997 | url = http://bahai-library.com/stockman_bahai_syncretism}}</ref> Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s, however, assert that their religion is a distinct tradition with its own [[Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> literature|scriptures]], [[Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> teachings|teachings]], [[Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> laws|laws]], and [[Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> history|history]].<ref name="britannica" /><ref name="EoI">{{cite encyclopedia | title=Bahais | encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Islam Online | url = http://www.brillonline.nl/public/demo#islam | accessdate=May 3, 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070507043610/http://www.brillonline.nl/public/demo| archivedate= May 07 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> While the religion was initially seen as a sect of Islam, most religious specialists now see it as an independent religion, with its religious background in [[Shi'a Islam]] being seen as analogous to the Jewish context in which Christianity was established.<ref name="vyer">{{cite book | first = J.D. | last = Van der Vyer | publisher=  Martinus Nijhoff Publishers | year = 1996 | isbn = 90-411-0176-4 | title = Religious human rights in global perspective: religious perspectives | page = 449}}</ref>  Muslim institutions and clergy, both [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] and [[Shia Islam|Shia]], consider Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s to be deserters or [[Apostasy in Islam|apostates from Islam]], which has led to Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s being [[Persecution of Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s|persecuted]].<ref>{{cite book | first = Kevin | last = Boyle | first2= Juliet | last2 = Sheen | title = Freedom of religion and belief: a world report | publisher = Routledge | year = 1997 | isbn = 0-415-15978-4 | page = 29}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | first = Reza | last = Afshari | pages = 119<U+2013>120 | title = Human rights in Iran: the abuse of cultural relativism | publisher = University of Pennsylvania Press | year = 2001 | isbn = 0-8122-3605-X}}</ref> Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s, themselves, describe their faith as an independent world religion, differing from the other traditions in its relative age and in the appropriateness of Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h's teachings to the modern context.<ref name="lundberg">{{cite book | title = Baha'i Apocalypticism: The Concept of Progressive Revelation | first = Zaid | last = Lundberg | date = 1996<U+2013>2005 | url = http://bahai-library.com/lundberg_bahai_apocalypticism | accessdate =May 1, 2007 | chapter = The Concept of Progressive Revelation | publisher = Department of History of Religion at the Faculty of Theology, Lund University }}</ref> Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h is believed to have fulfilled the [[Eschatology|messianic expectations]] of these precursor faiths.<ref name="buck_eschatologic">{{cite book

{{Main|Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Faith and the unity of humanity}}
The Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> writings state that human beings have a "rational [[Soul (spirit)|soul]]", and that this provides the species with a unique capacity to recognize God's station and humanity's relationship with its creator. Every human is seen to have a duty to recognize God through His [[Manifestation of God|messengers]], and to conform to their teachings.<ref>{{cite book |first=Michael D. |last=McMullen |year=2000 |title=The Baha'i: The Religious Construction of a Global Identity |publisher=Rutgers University Press |location=Atlanta, Georgia |isbn= 0-8135-2836-4 |pages= 57<U+2013>58 |url = http://books.google.com/books?id=lF0UquZAZW8C}}</ref> Through recognition and obedience, service to humanity and regular prayer and spiritual practice, the Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> writings state that the soul becomes closer to God, the spiritual ideal in Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> belief. When a human dies, the soul passes into the next world, where its spiritual development in the physical world becomes a basis for judgment and advancement in the spiritual world. Heaven and Hell are taught to be spiritual states of nearness or distance from God that describe relationships in this world and the next, and not physical places of reward and punishment achieved after death.<ref name="lafd">{{cite book | title = Life After Death: A study of the afterlife in world religions | last = Masumian | first = Farnaz | publisher = Oneworld Publications | location = Oxford | year = 1995 | isbn = 1-85168-074-8}}</ref> See [[Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Faith on life after death]].

The Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> writings emphasize the essential equality of human beings, and the abolition of prejudice. Humanity is seen as essentially one, though highly varied; its diversity of race and culture are seen as worthy of appreciation and acceptance. Doctrines of racism, nationalism, caste, social class, and gender-based hierarchy are seen as artificial impediments to unity.<ref name="eor" /> The Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> teachings state that the unification of humanity is the paramount issue in the religious and political conditions of the present world.<ref name="britannica" />

===Summary===
[[Shoghi Effendi]], the appointed head of the religion from 1921 to 1957, wrote the following summary of what he considered to be the distinguishing principles of [[Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h]]'s teachings, which, he said, together with the laws and ordinances of the ''[[Kit<U+00E1>b-i-Aqdas]]'' constitute the bedrock of the Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Faith:
{{quote|The independent search after truth, unfettered by [[superstition]] or tradition; the oneness of the entire [[Human|human race]], the pivotal principle and fundamental doctrine of the Faith; the basic unity of all religions; the condemnation of all forms of [[prejudice]], whether religious, racial, class or national; the harmony which must exist between religion and science; the equality of men and women, the two wings on which the bird of human kind is able to soar; the introduction of compulsory education; the adoption of a [[Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Faith and auxiliary language|universal auxiliary language]]; the abolition of the extremes of wealth and poverty; the institution of a [[World government|world tribunal]] for the adjudication of disputes between nations; the exaltation of work, performed in the spirit of service, to the rank of [[worship]]; the glorification of justice as the ruling principle in human society, and of religion as a bulwark for the protection of all peoples and nations; and the establishment of a permanent and [[World peace|universal peace]] as the supreme goal of all mankind<U+2014>these stand out as the essential elements [which Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h proclaimed].<ref>{{cite book |first=Shoghi |last=Effendi |authorlink=Shoghi Effendi |year=1944 |title=God Passes By |publisher=Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Publishing Trust |location=Wilmette, Illinois, US |isbn=0-87743-020-9 |url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/GPB/gpb-20.html#gr7 | pages=281<U+2013>2}}</ref>}}

===Mystical teachings===
Although the [[Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> teachings]] have a strong emphasis on social and ethical issues, there exist a number of foundational texts that have been described as mystical.<ref name="britannica" /> The ''[[Seven Valleys]]'' is considered Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h's "greatest mystical composition."

The Lesser Covenant is viewed as an agreement between a Messenger of God and his followers and includes social practices and the continuation of authority in the religion. At this time Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s view Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h's revelation as a binding lesser covenant for his followers; in the Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> writings being firm in the covenant is considered a virtue to work toward.<ref name="momen_covenant">{{cite web | title = Covenant, The, and Covenant-breaker | last = Momen | first = Moojan | accessdate =June 14, 2006 | url = http://bahai-library.com/momen_encyclopedia_covenant#3.%20The%20Lesser%20Covenant }}</ref> The Greater Covenant is viewed as a more enduring agreement between God and humanity, where a Manifestation of God is expected to come to humanity about every thousand years, at times of turmoil and uncertainty.

Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> history follows a sequence of leaders, beginning with the [[B<U+00E1>b]]'s May 23, 1844 declaration in [[Shiraz, Iran]], and ultimately resting on an administrative order established by the central figures of the religion. The Bahai community was mostly confined to the [[Persian Empire|Persian]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] empires until after the death of Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h in 1892, at which time he had followers in 13 countries of Asia and Africa.<ref name="rob4">{{cite book |author= Taherzadeh, Adib |year= 1987 |title= The Revelation of Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h, Volume 4: Mazra'ih & Bahji 1877<U+2013>92 |page=125 |publisher= George Ronald |location=Oxford, UK |isbn= 0-85398-270-8 |url=http://www.peyman.info/cl/Baha%27i/Others/ROB/V4/p118-144Ch08.html#p125}}</ref> Under the leadership of his son, `Abdu'l-Bah<U+00E1>, the religion gained a footing in Europe and America, and was consolidated in Iran, where it still suffers intense [[Persecution of Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s|persecution]].<ref name="affolter"/>  After the death of `Abdu'l-Bah<U+00E1> in 1921, the leadership of the Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> community entered a new phase, evolving from a single individual to an administrative order with both elected bodies and appointed individuals.<ref name="PSmith56" />

===The B<U+00E1>b===
{{Main|B<U+00E1>b}}
[[File:Shrine Bab North West.jpg|left|alt=A domed building|thumb|upright|[[Shrine of the B<U+00E1>b]] in Haifa, Israel.]]
On May 23, 1844 Siyyid `Al<U+00ED>-Muhammad of Shiraz, Iran proclaimed that he was "the B<U+00E1>b" ({{lang|ar|<U+0627><U+0644><U+0628><U+0627><U+0628>}} "the Gate"), referring to his later claim to the station of [[Mahdi]], the Twelfth Imam of [[Shi'a Islam|Shi`a Islam]].<ref name="affolter" /> His followers were therefore known as [[B<U+00E1>bism|B<U+00E1>b<U+00ED>s]]. As the B<U+00E1>b's teachings spread, which the Islamic clergy saw as a threat, his followers came under increased persecution and torture.<ref name="britannica" /> The conflicts escalated in several places to military sieges by the [[List of kings of Persia|Shah]]'s army. The B<U+00E1>b himself was imprisoned and eventually executed in 1850.<ref>{{cite journal | url = http://bahai-library.com/winters_dying_for_god | last = Winter | first = Jonah | date =September 17, 1997 | title= Dying for God: Martyrdom in the Shii and Babi Religions | journal = Master of Arts Thesis, University of Toronto | ref = harv }}</ref>

Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s see the B<U+00E1>b as the forerunner of the Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Faith, because the B<U+00E1>b's writings introduced the concept of "[[He whom God shall make manifest]]", a Messianic figure whose coming, according to Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s, was announced in the scriptures of all of the world's great religions, and whom Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h, the founder of the Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Faith, claimed to be in 1863.<ref name="britannica" /> [[Shrine of the B<U+00E1>b|The B<U+00E1>b's tomb]], located in [[Haifa|Haifa, Israel]], is an important place of [[Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> pilgrimage|pilgrimage]] for Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s.

M<U+00ED>rz<U+00E1> Husayn `Al<U+00ED> N<U+00FA>r<U+00ED> was one of the early followers of the B<U+00E1>b, and later took the title of Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h. He was arrested and imprisoned for this involvement in 1852. Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h relates that in 1853, while incarcerated in the dungeon of the [[S<U+00ED>y<U+00E1>h-Ch<U+00E1>l]] in [[Tehran]], he received the first intimations that he was the one anticipated by the B<U+00E1>b.<ref name="eor" />

Shortly thereafter he was expelled from [[Tehran]] to [[Baghdad]], in the [[Ottoman Empire]];<ref name="eor" /> then to Constantinople (now [[Istanbul]]); and then to Adrianople (now [[Edirne]]). In 1863, at the time of his banishment from Baghdad to Constantinople, Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h declared his claim to a divine mission to his family and followers. Tensions then grew between him and [[Subh-i-Azal]], the appointed leader of the B<U+00E1>b<U+00ED>s who did not recognize Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h's claim. Throughout the rest of his life Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h gained the allegiance of most of the B<U+00E1>b<U+00ED>s, who came to be known as Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s. Beginning in 1866, he began declaring his mission as a Messenger of God in letters to the world's religious and secular rulers, including [[Pope Pius IX]], [[Napoleon III]], and [[Queen Victoria]].

In 1868 Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h was banished by Sultan [[Abd<U+00FC>l<U+00E2>ziz]] a final time to the Ottoman penal colony of [[Acre, Israel|`Akk<U+00E1>]], in present-day [[Israel]].<ref name="iranica">{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia= Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Iranica |year= 1989 |article=Baha'-allah | first = Juan | last = Cole | authorlink = Juan Cole | url = http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/baha-allah| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071116044401/http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/v3f4/v3f4a085.html | archivedate = November 16, 2007}}</ref> Towards the end of his life, the strict and harsh confinement was gradually relaxed, and he was allowed to live in a home near `Akk<U+00E1>, while still officially a prisoner of that city.<ref name="iranica" /> He died there in 1892.

From its origins in the [[Persian Empire|Persian]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Empires, by the early 20th century there were a number of converts in [[South Asia|South]] and [[South East Asia]], Europe, and North America. During the 1950s and 1960s, vast [[Pioneering (Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>)|travel teaching]] efforts brought the religion to almost every country and territory of the world. By the 1990s, Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s were developing programs for systematic consolidation on a large scale, and the early 21st century saw large influxes of new adherents around the world.

The laws of the Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Faith primarily come from the ''[[Kit<U+00E1>b-i-Aqdas]]'', written by Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h.<ref name="ency_laws">{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Faith |title= Law |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |isbn= 1-85168-184-1 |pages=  223<U+2013>225}}</ref> The following are a few examples of basic laws and religious observances.

*[[Prayer in the Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Faith]] consists of obligatory prayer and devotional (general) prayer. Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s over the age of 15 must individually recite an [[Obligatory Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> prayers|obligatory prayer]] each day, using fixed words and form. In addition to the daily obligatory prayer, believers are directed to daily offer [[Prayer in the Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Faith|devotional prayer]] and to meditate and study sacred scripture. There is no set form for devotions and meditations, though the devotional prayers written by the central figures of the Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Faith and collected in prayer books are held in high esteem. Reading aloud of prayers from prayer books is a typical feature of Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> gatherings.
*[[Backbiting]] and gossip are prohibited and denounced.
*Adult Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s in good health should observe a [[Nineteen Day Fast|nineteen-day sunrise-to-sunset fast]] each year from March 2 through March 20.
*Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s are forbidden to drink [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] or to take drugs, unless prescribed by doctors.
*[[Sexual intercourse]] is only permitted between a husband and wife, and thus [[premarital]], [[extramarital sex|extramarital]] and homosexual intercourse are forbidden. ''(See also [[Homosexuality and the Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Faith]])''
*Gambling is forbidden.
*[[Fanaticism]] is forbidden.
*Adherence to [[ritual]] is discouraged, with the notable exception of the obligatory prayers.
*Abstaining from [[Partisan (political)|partisan]] politics is required.

While some of the laws from the Kit<U+00E1>b-i-Aqdas are applicable at the present time and may be enforced to a degree by the administrative institutions,<ref name="PSmith158">{{Harvnb|Smith|2008|pp=158<U+2013>161}}</ref> Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h has provided for the progressive application of other laws that are dependent upon the existence of a predominantly Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> society.

===Marriage===
{{Main|Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> marriage}}

The Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> marriage ceremony is simple; the only compulsory part of the wedding is the reading of the wedding vows prescribed by [[Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h]] which both the groom and the bride read, in the presence of two witnesses.<ref name="PSmith164"/> The vows are "We will all, verily, abide by the Will of God."<ref name="PSmith164"/>

===Work===
[[Monasticism]] is forbidden, and Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s attempt to ground their spirituality in ordinary daily life. Performing useful work, for example, is not only required but considered a form of worship.<ref name="britannica" /> Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h prohibited a [[Mendicancy|mendicant]] and [[Asceticism|ascetic]] lifestyle.<ref name="PSmith154">{{Harvnb|Smith|2008|pp=154<U+2013>155}}</ref>  The importance of self-exertion and service to humanity in one's spiritual life is emphasised further in Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h's writings, where he states that work done in the spirit of service to humanity enjoys a rank equal to that of prayer and worship in the sight of God.<ref name="britannica" />

===Calendar===
{{Main|Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> calendar}}
The Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> calendar is based upon the calendar established by the B<U+00E1>b. The year consists of 19 months, each having 19 days, with four or five [[Ayy<U+00E1>m-i-H<U+00E1>|intercalary days]], to make a full [[Tropical year|solar year]].<ref name="eor" /> The Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> New Year corresponds to the traditional Persian New Year, called [[Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Naw-R<U+00FA>z|Naw R<U+00FA>z]], and occurs on the [[vernal equinox]], March 21, at the end of the month of fasting. Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> communities gather at the beginning of each month at a meeting called a [[Nineteen Day Feast|Feast]] for worship, consultation and socializing.<ref name="britannica" />

Each of the 19 months is given a name which is an attribute of God; some examples include Bah<U+00E1><U+2019> (Splendour), <U+2018>Ilm (Knowledge), and Jam<U+00E1>l (Beauty).<ref name="PSmith188">{{Harvnb|Smith|2008|pp=188<U+2013>190}}</ref> The Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> week is familiar in that it consists of seven days, with each day of the week also named after an attribute of God. Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s observe 11 [[Ascension of Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h|Holy Days]] throughout the year, with work suspended on 9 of these. These days commemorate important anniversaries in the history of the religion.<ref name="PSmith188"/>

Worldwide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482.<ref>{{cite journal |title= The Baha'i Faith 1957<U+2013>1988: A Survey of Contemporary Developments | first = Moojan | last = Momen | coauthors = Smith, Peter | year = 1989 | url = http://bahai-library.com/momen_smith_developments_1957-1988 |volume = 19 | journal = Religion |issue= 1 | pages=63<U+2013>91 |doi= 10.1016/0048-721X(89)90077-8 |ref= harv}}</ref>

===Iran===
The marginalization of the Iranian Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s by current governments is rooted in historical efforts by Muslim clergy to persecute the religious minority. When the B<U+00E1>b started attracting a large following, the clergy hoped to stop the movement from spreading by stating that its followers were enemies of God. These clerical directives led to mob attacks and public executions.<ref name="affolter"/> Starting in the twentieth century, in addition to repression that impacted individual Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s, centrally directed campaigns that targeted the entire Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> community and institutions were initiated.<ref name="ihrdc">{{cite web |author=Iran Human Rights Documentation Center| publisher=Iran Human Rights Documentation Center|title=A Faith Denied: The Persecution of the Baha'is of Iran|year=2007|accessdate=1 May 2007|url=http://www.iranhrdc.org/httpdocs/English/pdfs/Reports/A-Faith-Denied_Dec06.pdf|format=PDF | archiveurl= http://wayback.archive.org/web/20100902191009/http://www.iranhrdc.org/httpdocs/English/pdfs/PressReleases/2008/Press-05-15-08.pdf| archivedate =September 2, 2010}}</ref> In one case in [[Yazd]] in 1903 more than 100 Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s were killed.<ref name="nash">{{cite book | title  = Iran's secret pogrom: The conspiracy to wipe out the Baha<U+02BC>is | first = Geoffrey | last = Nash | publisher= Neville Spearman Limited | location = Sudbury, Suffolk | year = 1982 | isbn = 0-85435-005-5}}</ref> Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> schools, such as the Tarbiyat boys' and girl's schools in Tehran, were closed in the 1930s and 40s, Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> marriages were not recognized and [[Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> texts]] were censored.<ref name="ihrdc" /><ref name="sanasarian">{{cite book | first = Eliz | last = Sanasarian|title = Religious Minorities in Iran | location = Cambridge | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 2000 | pages = 52<U+2013>53 | isbn = 0-521-77073-4 | url = http://www.books.google.com/books?id=mpQCjXm0HAwC}}</ref>

The [[Egyptian identification card controversy]] began in the 1990s when the government modernized the electronic processing of [[identity documents]], which introduced a de facto requirement that documents must list the person's religion as Muslim, Christian, or Jewish (the only three religions officially recognized by the government). Consequently, Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s were unable to obtain government identification documents (such as national identification cards, birth certificates, death certificates, marriage or divorce certificates, or passports) necessary to exercise their rights in their country unless they lied about their religion, which conflicts with Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> religious principle.<ref name="hor">{{cite web | title = Congressional Human Rights Caucus, House of Representatives | accessdate =December 29, 2006 | date = November 16, 2005 | url = http://lantos.house.gov/HoR/CA12/Human+Rights+Caucus/Briefing+Testimonies/11-17-05+Testimony+of+Kit+Bigelow+Egypt+Briefing.htm|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061227195313/http://lantos.house.gov/HoR/CA12/Human+Rights+Caucus/Briefing+Testimonies/11-17-05+Testimony+of+Kit+Bigelow+Egypt+Briefing.htm |archivedate = December 27, 2006|deadurl=yes}}</ref> Without documents, they could not be employed, educated, treated in hospitals, travel outside of the country, or vote, among other hardships.<ref name="hor"/> Following a protracted legal process culminating in a court ruling favorable to the Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s, the interior minister of Egypt released a decree on April 14, 2009, amending the law to allow Egyptians who are not Muslim, Christian, or Jewish to obtain identification documents that list dash in place of one of the three recognized religions.<ref>{{cite news | title = Egypt officially changes rules for ID cards | last = Editors of Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> News Service | date = April 17, 2009 | accessdate =June 16, 2009 | publisher = Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> News Service | url = http://news.bahai.org/story/707 }}</ref> The first identification cards were issued to two Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s under the new decree on August 8, 2009.<ref>{{cite web | title = First identification cards issued to Egyptian Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s using a "dash" instead of religion | last = Editors of Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> News Service | date = August 14, 2009 | accessdate =August 16, 2009 | publisher = Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> News Service | url = http://news.bahai.org/story/726 }}</ref>

===Reactions===
[[Bernard Lewis]] states that the Muslim laity and Islamic authorities have always had great difficulty in accommodating post-Islamic [[monotheistic]] religions such as the Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Faith, since the followers of such religions cannot be dismissed either as benighted [[mushrik|heathens]], like the [[polytheists]] of Asia and the [[animists]] of Africa, nor as [[People of the Book|followers of earlier revelations]], like the Jews and Christians. Moreover, their very existence presents a challenge to the Islamic doctrine of the finality of Muhammad's revelation.<ref>{{harvnb|Lewis|1984|pp=20<U+2013>21}}</ref>
