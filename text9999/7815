'''Lemmons''', also known as '''Gladsmuir House''', was the home of novelists [[Kingsley Amis]] (1922<U+2013>1995) and [[Elizabeth Jane Howard]] (1923<U+2013>2014) on [[Monken Hadley Common|Hadley Common]], [[Monken Hadley]], on the border of [[north London]] and [[Hertfordshire]].<ref name=Keulks2003p135>Gavin Keulks, ''Father and Son: Kingsley Amis, Martin Amis, and the British Novel Since 1950'', University of Wisconsin Press, 2003, p.

The couple bought the [[Georgian architecture|Georgian house]] and its eight acres of land at auction for <U+00A3>48,000 in 1968, and lived there until 1976. The house had been registered as a Grade II [[Listed building (United Kingdom)|listed building]] in 1949 under the name Gladsmuir House.<ref>Zachary Leader, ''The Life of Kingsley Amis'', Jonathan Cape, 2006, pp. 607, 617.</ref> Jane Howard restored its previous name, Lemmons; the next owners changed it back to Gladsmuir.<ref>Elizabeth Jane Howard, ''Slipstream'', Pan Macmillan, 2011 [2002], p. 374.

Jane and Kingsley lived at Lemmons with Jane's mother and brother, two artist friends, and Kingsley's three children, Philip, [[Martin Amis|Martin]] and Sally. Several of the family's novels were written at Lemmons, including Kingsley's ''[[The Green Man]]'' (1969) and ''[[The Alteration]]'' (1976), Jane's ''Odd Girl Out'' (1972) and ''Mr. Wrong'' (1975), and Martin's ''[[The Rachel Papers (novel)|The Rachel Papers]]'' (1973) and ''[[Dead Babies (novel)|Dead Babies]]'' (1975).<ref>Leader 2006, pp. 614, 633, 645.</ref>

[[Cecil Day-Lewis]], the [[Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom|poet laureate]], his wife, [[Jill Balcon]], and their children, [[Daniel Day-Lewis]] and [[Tamasin Day-Lewis]], stayed at Lemmons in the spring of 1972, when Cecil was dying of cancer.<ref name=Sansom>Ian Sansom, [http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/apr/03/great-dynasties-day-lewis-amis "Great dynasties of the world: The Day-Lewises"], ''The Guardian'', 3 April 2010.</ref> He died in the house on 22 May that year, shortly after writing "At Lemmons," his last poem.<ref name=poem/><ref name=Stanford>Peter Stanford, ''C Day-Lewis: A Life'', Bloomsbury Publishing, 2007, p.

==History==
===16th<U+2013>19th century===
[[File:Frances Trollope by Auguste Hervieu (2).jpg|thumb|220px|alt=photograph|[[Frances Trollope]] (1779<U+2013>1863) may have lived in the house from 1836 to 1838.]]

The land and an earlier house were owned by Henry Bellamy in 1584. The Quilter family owned the land from 1736 to 1909 (it was an estate of 23 acres in 1778).<ref>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=26963 Baker 1976]: "South of the common, Lemmons, formerly Gladsmuir House, stands on the site of a house belonging to Henry Bellamy in 1584; the building, with a Doric porch, an extension to the east, and a room enriched with late 18th-century medallions, has been much altered since it was built by the Quilter family, which owned the property from 1736 to 1909. It was owned by the author Kingsley Amis in 1972, when the poet laureate Cecil Day-Lewis died there." Footnote 90: "The house had an estate of 23 a. in 1778."</ref> A Major Hemery appears to have lived in the house in or around 1881.<ref>William Spencer Clarke, ''The Suburban Homes of London'', 1881, p. 31.</ref> Captain Thomas Hall Rokeby Plumer, the 2nd [[Viscount Plumer]], lived there in the 1920s.<ref>''Dod's Peerage'', Dod's Peerage, Ltd., 1924, p. 150.</ref>

The writer [[Frances Trollope]], mother of novelist [[Anthony Trollope]], rented a house on Hadley Common from January 1836 until the early summer of 1838, possibly Gladsmuir, shortly after the death of her husband and one of her sons.<ref name=Super1991p31/> According to Robert Bradford in his 2011 biography of Martin Amis, Jane Howard discovered the Trollope connection from the house's papers, and said that Frances Trollope had purchased it, although a purchase seems unlikely given the Trollope family's finances.<ref>Robert Bradford, ''Martin Amis: The Biography'', Pegasus, 2012 [2011], p. 94: "When Kingsley and Jane purchased the property it was called Gladsmuir but Jane discovered its original name from the deeds and also that it had once been owned by Frances Trollope, mother of the more famous Anthony and herself a prodigious writer and literary hostess."</ref>

Frances Trollope, her daughters, Emily and Cecilia, and two of her sons, Anthony and Tom, moved to Hadley Common in 1836 from [[Bruges]], Belgium, where they had fled to escape debtors' prison in England. When Trollope's husband (the debtor) died, the threat of prison receded.<ref>[http://www.oxforddnb.com/templates/article.jsp?articleid=27751 "Frances Trollope"], ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''.</ref> Emily was ill with [[tuberculosis]]; her doctor had advised that winter in England would benefit her.<ref name=Super1991p31/>

Trollope described the property as a "pleasant house with a good garden on the common at Hadley, near Barnet," and her "pretty cottage." R. H. Super writes that she invited eight guests to stay with her one Christmas, in addition to her family, so referring to it as a cottage was somewhat misleading.<ref name=Super1991p31>R. H. Super, ''The Chronicler of Barsetshire: A Life of Anthony Trollope'', University of Michigan Press, 1991, pp. 31<U+2013>34.</ref> The move did not, in the end, help Emily, who died in February 1836. She was buried in the nearby churchyard at the Church of St Mary the Virgin. Anthony Trollope later placed one of his characters, in ''The Bertrams'' (1859), in a dull country house in Hadley.<ref>Super 1991, p. 32; Anthony Trollope, [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/26001/26001-h/26001-h.htm ''The Bertrams''], 1859.</ref>

===20th century===
[[File:Gate on Hadley Green Road - geograph.org.uk - 367692.jpg|thumb|300px|Gate into Hadley Common, which was enclosed in 1777]]

Jane Howard found that the house had previously been called Lemmons, and decided to restore that name.<ref>Howard 2011, p. 374.</ref> It was known as Gladsmuir when they bought it&nbsp;<U+2013> from Gladsmuir Heath, the former name of Hadley Common, site of the [[Battle of Barnet]] in 1471 during the [[Wars of the Roses]].<ref>John Edwin Cussans, ''History of Hertfordshire'', Chatto, 1879, p. 221.</ref> The house had been registered under that name as a Grade II [[Listed building (United Kingdom)|listed building]] in 1949, with an address in Hadley Wood Road; as of 2014 the address was listed as Hadley Common.<ref name=listed/>

Made of red brick with a [[stucco]] trim, the house has [[Bay (architecture)|five-bays]], two-storeys, [[sash window]]s, and a central [[Doric order|Doric]] porch with [[Fluting (architecture)|fluted]] columns and [[entablature]] with [[triglyph]]s. There is a later extension and a detached housekeeper's cottage, Gladsmuir Cottage.<ref name=listed>[http://list.english-heritage.org.uk/resultsingle.aspx?uid=1359075 "Gladsmuir"], English Heritage: "Circa 1830 Villa.

In the three-acre garden, when Jane and Kingsley Amis lived there, there was an old barn that was itself a listed building, a conservatory and a gravel drive, three descending lawns, a rose garden, cedar trees, a mulberry tree (where Lucy Snowe, their cat, was buried), and a [[weathervane]] dating to 1775. At the end of the garden, through a five-bar gate, there lay a five-acre meadow that also belonged to the property and had been let out to two local women for their horses.<ref>For the weathervane, Bridget Cherry, ''London: North'', Yale University Press, 1998, p. 186; for the rest, Amis 2000, pp. 183<U+2013>184; Howard 2002, pp. 372, 407.</ref>

Kingsley and Jane married in 1965 after meeting two years earlier at the [[Cheltenham Literary Festival]], which she had helped to organize. In 1947 she had left her first husband, [[Peter Scott]], with whom she had a daughter, and in 1963 divorced her second, Jim Douglas-Henry.<ref>Howard 2011, pp. 219, 332<U+2013>338, 348; Andrew Brown, [http://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/nov/09/classics.biography "Loves and letters"], ''The Guardian'', 9 November 2002.</ref> Kingsley was still married to his first wife, Hilly Bardwell, when he and Jane began an affair.<ref>Amis 2000, pp. 31<U+2013>33.</ref>

The couple first lived together in an [[Edwardian architecture|Edwardian house]] at 108 [[Maida Vale]], London, [[W postcode area|W2]]. They bought Lemmons at auction for <U+00A3>48,000 in 1968, and lived there from 28 November that year.<ref>Howard 2011, pp. 364, 372, 374.</ref> Kingsley wrote to the poet [[Philip Larkin]] in April 1969: 

<div style="background-color:none;margin-right:8em;margin-left:0em;border-left:solid 10px #ccc;padding:1.5em;text-align:justify">

[[File:Martin Amis 2012 by Maximilian Schoenherr.jpg|thumb|300px|alt=photograph|[[Martin Amis]] wrote his first two novels at Lemmons.]]

The core household consisted of Jane and Kingsley; Jane's mother, Katherine ("Kit"), a former ballerina, who died in the house in 1972; one of Jane's brothers, Colin ("Monkey"); and artists Sargy Mann and Terry Raybauld.<ref>Keulks 2003, p. [http://books.google.com/books?id=9Aip8etZ_hwC&pg=PA135 135]; [http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/apr/03/great-dynasties-day-lewis-amis Sansom (''Guardian'')], 3 April 2010.</ref> The housekeeper, Mrs. Uniacke, lived in Gladsmuir Cottage.<ref>Leader 2006, p. 609.</ref> Kingsley's children, Philip, Martin and Sally lived in the house from time to time, mostly outside term time, or at weekends in the case of Philip and Martin; the children were 17, 16 and 12 when Kingsley and Jane married.<ref>Leader 2006, pp. 630, 668.</ref> Sally moved into Lemmons in 1970 when Martin was in his second year at Oxford.<ref>Leader 2006, p. 614.</ref> 

It was Jane who encouraged Martin to start reading. When she and Kingsley married, Martin was reading comics and [[Harold Robbins]]; she recommended [[Jane Austen]], [[Charles Dickens]], [[Scott Fitzgerald]], [[Evelyn Waugh]], [[Graham Greene]] and [[William Golding]]. She also advised him to try for a place at Oxford, for which he said he owed her an "unknowable debt." After 12 months at Sussex Tutors (a [[Cram school#United Kingdom|crammer]] in Brighton) in 1967<U+2013>1968, he passed six O-levels and 3 A-levels, and won an [[Exhibition (scholarship)|exhibition]] to [[Exeter College, Oxford]].<ref>Amis 2000, pp. 13<U+2013>14 (for Sussex Tutors), 121 (for "unknowable debt"), 126 (for the exhibition), 173 (for Exeter).<p>

Martin lived at Lemmons until Christmas that year, after which he started work at ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'' and moved to central London, visiting his father and Jane at weekends. He shared a maisonette in or near [[Pont Street]], [[SW postcode area|SW1]], with a friend, Rob Henderson&nbsp;<U+2013> Henderson was Charles Highway in ''The Rachel Papers'', Gregory Riding in ''[[Success (novel)|Success]]'' (1978), and Kenrik in ''[[The Pregnant Widow]]'' (2011).<ref>Bradford 2012, p. 87.

The house on Hadley Common was a citadel of riotous insolvency&nbsp;<U+2013> not just at Christmas but every weekend. There was a great sense of in-depth back-up, a cellar, a barrel of malt whisky, a walk-in larder: proof against snowstorm or shutdown. I think it was that Christmas morning [1977], that all four Amises, with breakfast trays on their laps, watched ''Journey to the Centre of the Earth''&nbsp;<U+2013> then the visit to the pub, then the day-long, the week-long lunch. And with Kingsley the hub of all humour and high spirits, like an engine of comedy&nbsp;... I felt so secure in that house <U+2013> and, clearly, so insecure elsewhere&nbsp;<U+2013> that I always experienced a caress of apprehension as I climbed into the car on Sunday night, any Sunday night, and headed back to the motorway and Monday, to the flat or the flatlet, the street, the job, the tramp dread, the outside world.<ref>Amis 2000, p. 53.</ref></div>

===Novels===
Kingsley wrote ten books at Lemmons, in his wood-panelled study on the ground floor, including ''[[The Green Man]]'' (1969), ''What Became of Jane Austin? And Other Questions'' (1970), ''Girl, 20'' (1971), ''The Riverside Villas Murder'' (1973), ''Ending Up'' (1974), ''[[The Alteration]]'' (1976), and part of ''Harold's Years'' (1977).<ref>Leader 2006, pp. 614, 633, 642<U+2013>643, 645. For the wood-panelled study, p. 620; for the ground floor, Bradford 2012, p. 88.</ref> Jane finished ''Something in Disguise'' (1969), ''Odd Girl Out'' (1972) and ''Mr. Wrong'' (1975), though she spent most of her time looking after the house.<ref>Keulks 2003, p. 136.</ref>

Martin wrote his first two novels, ''[[The Rachel Papers (novel)|The Rachel Papers]]'' (1973) and ''[[Dead Babies (novel)|Dead Babies]]'' (1975), in his bedroom above Kingsley's study. The first draft of ''The Rachel Papers'' was started in July 1970 and completed in September 1972; it won the [[Somerset Maugham Award]] in 1974, which Kingsley had won in 1955 for ''[[Lucky Jim]]'' (1954). When he heard the prize had gone to Martin, Kingsley said words to the effect that, "Good that it's back in the family. It should keep the old prig turning in his grave," a reference to Maugham's view that ''Lucky Jim'''s characters were illustrative of the country's moral decline.<ref>Bradford 2012, p. 104; Jeffrey Meyers, ''Somerset Maugham: A Life'', Random House, 2010, pp. 312<U+2013>313.</ref>

[[File:Daniel Day-Lewis, Jaguar, Mille Miglia 2013 cropped.jpg|alt=photograph|thumb|220px|[[Daniel Day-Lewis]]]]

[[Tamasin Day-Lewis]] wrote that Lemmons was always full of "impossibly glamorous older people and a core commune of writers, painters and inventors; even the dogs and cats shared a communal basket, and there were always stray writers and publishers whose marriages were unravelling."<ref>Tamasin Day-Lewis, [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/7251899/Tamasin-Day-Lewis-Am-I-the-leggy-temptress-in-Martin-Amiss-new-novel.html "Tamasin Day-Lewis: Am I the 'leggy temptress' in Martin Amis's new novel?"], ''The Daily Telegraph'', 17 February 2010.</ref> Gully Wells, Martin's girlfriend and step-daughter of the philosopher [[A.

==Move to Hampstead==
Lemmons was featured in ''[[Woman's Journal (British magazine)|Woman's Journal]]'' in June 1976 in an advertisement for wallpaper by [[Arthur Sanderson & Sons]].<ref name=wallpaper>Keulks 2003, p. 284, n. 6, citing Ian Woodward, "A Lovely Couple," ''Woman's Journal'', June 1976, pp. 19<U+2013>21.</ref> The company decorated a room and took a photograph of Kingsley and Jane sitting in it, published under the headline "Very Sanderson, Very Amis."<ref>Leader 2006, p. 643.</ref>

The couple sold Lemmons shortly after this, for <U+00A3>105,000. They moved to a smaller house, Gardnor House, in Flask Walk, [[Hampstead]], London NW3. Kingsley was apparently tired of living so far from central London.<ref>Leader 2006, p. 667; Bradford 2012, p. 164, for <U+20A4>105,000.</ref> Jane loved Lemmons, but was exhausted from the effort of running it. Kingsley expected her to do most of the cooking and domestic work, for the family plus assorted guests, as well as drive him around and do the finances and much of the gardening. Women for Kingsley were "for bed and board," as Jane put it.
