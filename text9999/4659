==Early life, education and career==
Albio Sires was born in Cuba and immigrated to the United States with his family at age 11 with the help of relatives in the United States.<ref name="Washington Post Bio">{{cite web|title=Albio Sires (D)|url=http://projects.washingtonpost.com/2008/elections/nj/house/1083/albio-sires/|work=Washington Post Politics|publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=22 May 2012}}</ref> 

Sires is a graduate of [[Memorial High School (West New York, New Jersey)|Memorial High School]]. He went to [[Saint Peter's College (New Jersey)|Saint Peter's College]] on a basketball scholarship and received a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in 1974 in Spanish and Marketing.

==New Jersey government==
Sires served as the Speaker of the Assembly from 2002 to 2006 and was the first [[Hispanic]] person to serve as New Jersey's Assembly Speaker. He was considered a surprise pick for speaker, since he had only served one term in the Assembly before taking the position.  It has been reported that he was elected as speaker after Gov.-Elect [[Jim McGreevey]] decided he did not want then Assembly Minority Leader [[Joseph Doria]], a former speaker, to serve as speaker during his governorship.<ref>Herszenhorn, David M. [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990DE6D7123BF934A25752C1A9679C8B63 "Democrats Back McGreevey's Choice to Lead Assembly, Ending Feud"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', November 17, 2001. Accessed October 13, 2007.</ref>

Sires was an active Democrat in the 1970s and 1980s. He switched to the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] in 1985 and he ran for Congress in 1986 against [[Frank Guarini]]. Sires lost that election by a 71% to 26% margin. Sires left the Republican Party in 1994 and became a registered independent. Sires rejoined the Democratic Party in 1998. Just three years later, he became Speaker.<ref>[http://www.getnj.com/onlygameintown/albiosiresataglance.shtml Assembly Speaker Albio Sires, at a glance]</ref>

During his tenure as speaker, Sires served as [[Governor of New Jersey|Acting Governor of New Jersey]] on several occasions, when former Gov. Jim McGreevey and former Gov. [[Richard Codey]] left the state.  He was the first Hispanic person to serve as an Acting Governor of New Jersey.  As Acting Governor, Sires signed several bills into law and performed routine duties of the office.

For the 2006<U+2013>2008 legislative session, Sires was given the largely honorary title of Speaker Emeritus. Sires is a former Chairman of the Legislative Services Commission. Sires stepped down from his seat in the Assembly, and was replaced by [[Silverio Vega]], who was selected by the Democratic district committee to replace Sires. Vega was sworn in to office on December 11, 2006.<ref>[http://www.nj.com/news/jjournal/index.ssf?/base/news-0/1164697053196930.xml&coll=3 Vega is eager for challenge in WNY, Trenton], ''[[Jersey Journal]]'', November 28, 2006.</ref>

Sires was the [[Mayor of West New York, New Jersey]] from 1995 to 2006. Sires was succeeded by Vega, who will retain his mayoral seat while he simultaneously serves in the Assembly, joining three fellow Hudson County mayors <U+2014> [[Brian P. Stack|Brian Stack]] of [[Union City, New Jersey|Union City]] in the Assembly and both [[Nicholas Sacco]] of [[North Bergen, New Jersey|North Bergen]] and [[Joseph Doria]] of [[Bayonne, New Jersey|Bayonne]] in the [[New Jersey Senate]] <U+2014> who serve as both mayors and in the [[New Jersey Legislature]].  For many years, it was common for New Jersey mayors to serve in the legislature as well, though this practice has been abolished.

==Political campaigns==
===2006===
{{Main|New Jersey 13th congressional district special election, 2006}}
Sires won election to the [[United States House of Representatives]] from {{ushr|New Jersey|13|}} and won the [[Special elections to the United States House of Representatives|special election]] to complete the final two months of [[Bob Menendez]]'s term. Menendez moved up to the [[United States Senate]] to fill the seat vacated by [[Governor of New Jersey]] [[Jon Corzine]].

In the June 6, 2006, primary, Sires beat Assemblyman and [[Perth Amboy, New Jersey|Perth Amboy]] Mayor [[Joseph Vas]] in a bitter primary. Sires defeated Vas 68% to 32% and won in Union, Hudson and Essex Counties, with Vas bested Sires in Middlesex County. In the simultaneous special primary to fill the remaining two months, Sires won approximately 90% of the vote, defeating James Geron, assuring Sires of a Congressional seat as no Republican was seeking the term.  However, the 13th is so heavily Democratic that any Republican who opted to file would have faced nearly impossible odds in the special election.

Sires faced Republican [[John Guarini]] <U+2014> a salesman and second cousin of former Congressman [[Frank J. Guarini]] (1979<U+2013>93) <U+2014> who was unopposed for the GOP nomination. Vas did not seek the unexpired term seat.

''CQPolitics'' noted "Sires<U+2019> likely November victories would cap off his ambitions for a House seat, which he first expressed exactly 20 years ago under very different circumstances. He ran that year as the Republican challenger to entrenched incumbent Guarini, but managed only 27 percent of the vote."<ref>[http://www.cqpolitics.com/2006/06/nj_13_sires_wins_one_race_but.html NJ 13: Sires Goes 2-0, Will Be a Shoo-In for Vacant Seat] ''[[Congressional Quarterly]]'' web site, June 6, 2006.</ref>

Sires is part of a handful of [[Cubans|Cuban]]-lawmakers serving in the House, though he is the only Democrat.

After winning the election with 78% of the vote, Sires was sworn into the House on November 13, 2006 to begin to fill the remaining term of Senator [[Bob Menendez]].<ref>[http://www.app.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061114/NEWS03/611140327/1007 N.J.'s Sires one of two sworn in to vacant House seats], ''[[Asbury Park Press]]'', November 14, 2006.</ref>

===2010===

Sires was challenged by Republican nominee Henrietta Dwyer.
