'''Corvallis High School''', commonly shortened to '''CHS''', is a public high school that is located in [[Corvallis, Oregon]] in the [[United States]].  The school serves approximately 1,400 students in grades 9 through 12.  The principal is Suzanne Dalton.  The school mascot is the [[Spartan Army|spartan]].  The [[school colors]] are Columbia blue and white.

==Building==
The original Corvallis High School was built in 1910, which is now currently the site of Central Park in downtown Corvallis. This building burned in 1935.<ref>History page at Corvallis High School website[http://www.csd509j.net/chs/history/ "CHS Archives"]</ref>

The Corvallis School District quickly selected the site for a new high school on the northwest edge of town.  The second Corvallis High School building was an [[Art Deco]] structure constructed in 1936 by the [[Works Progress Administration]].  The building was added on to multiple times in the 50's and 60's with the addition of the science and library wing as well as the cafeteria and big gym addition.  In the spring of 2000, after the district finished a seismic analysis of its 17 schools,<ref>Waldrop, Becky, [http://gazettetimes.com/articles/2000/07/30/export8201.txt "Schools not ready for earthquakes"], ''gazettetimes.com'', [[July 29]] [[2000]].</ref> it was decided that the building was unsafe for student use.  A group was put together to decide whether a replacement school should be built on the existing site or at an alternative location.  It was decided that the replacement should be built on the existing site, favoring the central location over the opportunity to gain more land at an alternative location.  This decision also required the old building to be demolished which angered some citizens who believe the building to be a historic treasure to the town.<ref>Waldrop, Becky, [http://gazettetimes.com/articles/2003/07/08/news/top_story/tue01.txt "School building dispute polarizes sides"], ''gazettetimes.com'', [[July 8]] [[2003]]</ref>  In an effort to save the structure, the building was nominated and added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2003.<ref>[http://www.nationalregisterofhistoricplaces.com/OR/Benton/state.html National Register of Historical Places - OREGON (OR), Benton County<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> However, in the spring of 2004, construction began on the new building and the historic building was demolished in late fall, and thus it was removed from the register.<ref>Foster, Margaret, [http://www.nationaltrust.org/Magazine/archives/arc_news_2005/081705.htm "Demolition of Art Deco School Under Way in Oregon"], ''Preservation Online'', [[August 17]] [[2005]].</ref> <ref>[http://www.cr.nps.gov/nr/listings/20060428.HTM National Register of Historic Places Listings<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  

The new Corvallis High school (3rd Corvallis High School building) was opened in the fall of 2005.  Originally slated to be opened in January 2006, construction was far enough along to allow the 2005-06 school year to start in the new structure.  Construction continued on-site until the spring of 2006.

==Theater department==
CHS has a flourishing theater department which is currently headed by Eric MacCionnaith and Elizabeth Wyatt (district Technical Director). Numerous shows and assemblies take place inside the CHS Theater, including acts that rent the space for non-school performances. The CHS Theater is the largest school theater in the state of Oregon and one of the most expensive. The first production to be shown in the auditorium was a student devised piece entitled "Rootbound and Rootless". The piece was shown four times in the winter of 2005. Other acts performed on the stage include [[Peter Pan]], [[The Spitfire Grill]], [[The Nutcracker]], [[Galileo]] by [[Bertolt Brecht]] and several CHS Choir and Band concerts. Other theatrical productions have included several [[Improvisational theatre|improv]] troupes and plays such as [[A Servant of Two Masters]] and [[Waiting for Godot]]. In 2007, CHS Theater began to employ others and has had performances by [[Angelique Kidjo]], [[Dar Williams]], [[Neal Gladstone & Company]], [[Do Jump]], the [[BYU Young Ambassadors]], and [[Ladysmith Black Mambazo]] as well many other performers.

While the auditorium itself is commonly the area inside the wing that receives the most attention, there are many technological wonders within. The technical department within the CHS Theater, under the direction of Elizabeth Wyatt, hosts Technical Interns. These are highly qualified students who are able to take on leadership positions and demanding technical roles. 

The main stage theater is a state-of-the-art, modified-proscenium theater, seating 620. It has a {{convert|50|ft|m|0|sing=on}} fly tower with a counterweight system, an orchestra pit, one mid-stage trap, significant wing space, and a loading dock. The stage has a full set of drapes, including sky cyc, two scrims (one black, one natural) and a natural seamless drop. There is both a mid-stage and up-stage traveler in addition to the main house curtain. There are three self-lit acoustical shells over the stage for use when needed. The plywood floor has a resilient underlayment appropriate for dance.

Sound can be controlled from a rear-of-house booth or a vault position located in the middle of the house with the in-house 24-channel xxx mixer. Lighting is controlled by an ETC Expressions board with DMX positions throughout the facility. There are two followspots.

The black box is a 00 x 00 room with its own lighting and sound systems. It is equipped with black background curtains, a gray cyclorama and both blue- and green-screen curtains for video use. Seating capacity depends on configuration. With the maximum allowed set by code at 92.

Adjacent to the two performance spaces are dressing rooms, a makeup room and a scene shop.

Also in this facility are band and choir classrooms that can double as rehearsal and/or green rooms.

All spaces in the facility are linked by both a main-stage monitor system and intercom stations.

There is a ticket booth in the lobby of the main stage theater from which renting groups may sell tickets at their events, though not in advance.

The school's student center (cafeteria) is located next to the Performing Arts Center and may be rented for use. Catering services can be arranged.

School classrooms are available for rent outside of regular school hours.
