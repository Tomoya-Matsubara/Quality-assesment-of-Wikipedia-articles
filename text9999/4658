'''Miller James Huggins''' (March 27, 1879&nbsp;<U+2013> September 25, 1929) was an American [[professional baseball]] player and [[manager (baseball)|manager]]. A [[second baseman]], Huggins played in [[Major League Baseball]] for the [[Cincinnati Reds]] (1904<U+2013>1909) and [[St. Louis Cardinals]] (1910<U+2013>1916). He managed the Cardinals (1913<U+2013>1917) and [[New York Yankees]] (1918<U+2013>1929), including the [[Murderers' Row]] teams of the 1920s that won six [[American League]] (AL) pennants and three [[World Series]] championships.

Huggins was born in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]]. He received a degree in law from the [[University of Cincinnati]], where he was also [[captain (baseball)|captain]] on the [[Cincinnati Bearcats baseball|baseball team]]. Rather than serve as a lawyer, Huggins chose to pursue a professional baseball career. He played [[semi-professional]] and [[minor league baseball]] from 1898 through 1903, at which time he signed with the Reds.

As a player, Huggins was adept at getting on base. He was also an excellent fielding second baseman, earning the nicknames "Rabbit", "Little Everywhere", and "Mighty Mite" for his defensive prowess and was later considered an intelligent manager who understood the fundamentals of the game. Despite fielding successful teams for the Yankees in the 1920s, he continued to make personnel changes in order to maintain his teams' superiority in the AL. He was elected to the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame]] by the [[Veterans Committee]] in 1964.

==Early life==
Huggins was born in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], where his father, an Englishman, worked as a grocer.<ref name=koppett83/> His mother was a native of Cincinnati and had two brothers and one sister.<ref name=meriden/>

Huggins attended [[Woodward High School (Cincinnati, Ohio)|Woodward High School]], [[Walnut Hills High School]], and later the [[University of Cincinnati]].<ref name=meriden/><ref name=cincy/> At Cincinnati, Huggins studied law and played [[college baseball]] for the [[Cincinnati Bearcats baseball]] team.

==Professional career==
===Early playing career (1899<U+2013>1903)===
Huggins began his playing career in [[minor league baseball]] with the [[Mansfield Haymakers]] of the Class-B [[Interstate League]] in [[1899 in baseball|1899]]. He continued his minor league apprenticeship with the [[St. Paul Saints]] of the [[American Association (20th century)|American Association]] from [[1901 in baseball|1901]] through [[1903 in baseball|1903]].<ref name=leadoff/> Beginning his career exclusively as a [[handedness|right-handed]] hitter, Huggins began to bat from the left side in 1902 in response to his offensive struggles in the 1901 season, while also shifting his position to [[second base]] during his time at St. Paul.<ref name=meriden/>

[[File:Miller Huggins baseball card.jpg|right|upright|thumb|Miller Huggins' 1909 [[baseball card]]]]
Huggins handled 19 fielding chances, 11 [[putout]]s and nine [[assist (baseball)|assists]], without committing an [[error (baseball)|error]] in a game with the Saints in [[1902 in baseball|1902]]; the previous [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) record being 18, set by [[Fred Dunlap]] in [[1882 in baseball|1882]].<ref name=nineteenchances>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1955&dat=19230110&id=7hQrAAAAIBAJ&sjid=X5wFAAAAIBAJ&pg=5097,1596000|title=Miller Huggins Holds a Fielding Record: Yankees' Manager Handled 19 Chances In One Game At Second Base Without An Error In 1902|newspaper=Reading Eagle|date=January 10, 1923|accessdate=April 17, 2012}}</ref> In 1903, Huggins executed the first [[delayed steal]] in recorded baseball history.<ref name=cincy/>

===Cincinnati Reds (1904<U+2013>1909)===
Fleischmann, part-owner of the [[Cincinnati Reds]] of the [[National League]] (NL), kept an eye on Huggins while he played for St. Paul and the Reds duly purchased Huggins from the Saints before the [[1904 Cincinnati Reds season|1904 season]].<ref name=meriden/> He made his MLB debut on April 15, 1904,<ref name=nineteenchances/> and proved very adept at getting on base. He [[batting average|batted]] .264 with the Reds that season, improving in the [[1906 Cincinnati Reds season|1906 season]], finishing with a .292 batting average and 41 [[stolen base]]s,<ref name=leadoff/> as he spent considerable time working on his upper body strength.<ref name=meriden/>

Though Huggins hoped to be selected as [[Ned Hanlon (baseball)|Ned Hanlon]]'s successor as Cincinnati's manager after the 1907 season, the Reds instead went with [[John Ganzel]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=yykbAAAAIBAJ&sjid=vUgEAAAAIBAJ&pg=2598,4731177&dq=miller-huggins&hl=en|title=Stands No Chance of Being Manager: Miller Huggins|newspaper=The Pittsburgh Press|page=26|date=December 20, 1907|accessdate=April 17, 2012}}</ref> In [[1908 in baseball|1908]], Huggins played with the Reds in the [[Cuban-American Major League Clubs Series]]. Suffering from a broken ankle and torn ligaments in his shoulder, Huggins slumped to a .209 batting average during the [[1909 Cincinnati Reds season|1909 season]].<ref name=meriden/>

===St. Louis Cardinals (1910<U+2013>1917)===
Before the [[1910 Major League Baseball season|1910 season]], the Reds traded Huggins, along with [[Frank Corridon]] and [[Rebel Oakes]], to the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] in return for [[Fred Beebe]] and [[Alan Storke]]. Huggins set an MLB record on June 1, 1910 with six [[plate appearance]]s but no [[at bat]]s, as he drew four [[base on balls|walks]] and hit two [[sacrifice fly|sacrifice flies]].<ref name=leadoff/><ref name=nineteenchances/> In the same year Huggins batted .265 for the Cardinals, and led the NL in walks.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/freep/access/1748373012.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&type=historic&date=Jan+09%2C+1911&author=&pub=Detroit+Free+Press+%281858-1922%29&desc=MILLER+HUGGINS+AND+EVERS+BEST+WAITERS+IN+NATIONAL&pqatl=google |title=Miller Huggins And Evers Best Waiters In National: Official Figures for Strikeouts and Bases on Balls Are Interesting--Cardinals Lead League in Walking and Brooklyn Club in Whiffing |page=7 |newspaper=[[Detroit Free Press]]|date=January 9, 1911 |accessdate=April 17, 2012}} {{subscription required|date=April 2012}}</ref>

On July 13, 1911, Huggins tied the NL record for successful fielding chances with 16.<ref name=leadoff/> He later finished sixth in the voting for the [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award#Chalmers Award (1911<U+2013>1914)|Chalmers Award]] in 1911, which was awarded to the [[Most Valuable Player]]. In the [[1912 St. Louis Cardinals season|1912 season]], Huggins batted over .300 for the first time in his career.<ref name=meriden/>

Huggins became player-manager for the Cardinals after the 1912 season, succeeding [[Roger Bresnahan]],<ref name=fourpennants/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/ajc_historic/access/546617882.html?dids=546617882:546617882&FMT=CITE&FMTS=CITE:AI&date=Oct+24%2C+1912&author=&pub=The+Atlanta+Constitution&desc=MILLER+HUGGINS+FOR+ROGER%27S+JOB&pqatl=google |title=Miller Huggins For Roger's Job|newspaper=[[The Atlanta Constitution]]|page=10|date=October 24, 1912 |accessdate=April 17, 2012}} {{subscription required|date=April 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0F14F9345813738DDDAA0894D9415B828DF1D3 |title=Huggins to Manage Cardinals|page=S4 |date=November 3, 1912 |accessdate=April 17, 2012}}</ref> with team owner [[Helene Hathaway Britton]] preferring Huggins' "gentlemanly" manner, as opposed to Bresnahan's rougher personality.<ref name=koppett84>Koppett, p. 84</ref>

While he was attempting to raise money from the Fleischmann family, Britton sold the team to a group headed by [[Samuel Breadon]], who hired [[Branch Rickey]] to run the team's day-to-day operations in the [[front office]].<ref name=koppett84/>

Huggins had coached the young [[Rogers Hornsby]], helping him to correct his batting stance,<ref name=fourpennants/> and Hornsby duly succeeded Huggins as the team's starting second baseman in 1917, as Huggins ended his playing career.<ref name=koppett84/> He managed the team during 1917, the last year of his contract, but was not retained.<ref name=koppett84/>

===New York Yankees (1918<U+2013>1929)===
With the [[New York Yankees]] of the [[American League]] (AL) not performing well, Yankees [[List of New York Yankees owners and executives|owners]] [[Jacob Ruppert]] and [[Tillinghast L'Hommedieu Huston]] sought to replace [[Bill Donovan|"Wild" Bill Donovan]] as manager.<ref name=Smelser194/> [[Ban Johnson]],  AL [[List of American League presidents|president]], suggested Huggins to Ruppert as a replacement for Donovan. Huston, who had been in Europe at the time that Ruppert had made the appointment, disliked Huggins and wanted to hire [[Wilbert Robinson]], his drinking buddy.<ref name=Smelser194>Smelser, p. 194</ref> Ruppert himself had been put off by Huggins' wool cap and practice of smoking pipes in public, which he felt was the mark of the working class.<ref name=Smelser194/> However, Ruppert interviewed Huggins upon Johnson's recommendation, and agreed that Huggins knew much about baseball.<ref name=Smelser194/> Ruppert offered the job to Huggins, who initially did not want to take the position, as the Yankees were in no better a position than the Cardinals. [[J. G.
