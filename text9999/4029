==Texas A&M University (1983-1987)==
Crite chose to attend [[Texas A&M University]] and play basketball under coach [[Shelby Metcalf]].   In his very first game, against Texas Lutheran in 1983-1984, Crite became the first freshman in Aggie history to post a double-double (in this case, 24 points, 15 rebounds) in his first game.  Only one other Aggie freshman, [[Joseph Jones]], has duplicated that feat.<ref name="game1" >{{cite web  | last = Texas A&M Sports Information Department  | first =    | authorlink =  | coauthors =   | title = Aggies Ready to Battle No. 10 Oklahoma State   | work =   | publisher = KBTX 3, Bryan-College Station (Texas)  | date =    | url =http://www.kbtx.com/sports/headlines/1254272.html  | format =  | doi =  | accessdate = 2007-02-20 }}</ref>  

Crite started 118 of the 123<ref name="leader"/> games of his career, and showed steady improvement throughout his four years.  His freshman year (1983-1984), Crite averaged 8.9 points, 6.1 rebounds, 1.2 assists, and .9 blocks per game and completed 53% of his field goal attempts.  The following year he averaged 12.1 points per game, 8.2 rebounds, 1.2 assists, and 2.2 blocks, completing 56.7 percent of his field goals.  In the 1985-1986 season, Crite completed an impressive 58.0% of his field goals, averaging 13.3 points, 8 rebounds, 1.6 assists, and 1.3 blocks per game.  By his senior season he was averaging 16.8 points, 2.0 blocks, 7.4 rebounds, and 1.3 assists per game, completing 56.1% of his field goals.<ref name="dbbb"/>  For his accomplishments, Crite was a four-time "All Southwest West Conference" choice and was named "All Tournament" for three straight years.<ref name="about"/> 

Just as Crite appeared to be at the top of his game in his senior year, the team began struggling, losing nine of their last eleven games to finish the regular season 14-13.  The Aggies were seeded eighth in the [[Southwest Conference]], meaning they would open the conference tournament facing the top-seeded [[Texas Christian University|TCU]] Horned Frogs, who were ranked 15th nationally.  After Crite scored thirty points in a stunning upset of TCU, the team defeated the defending tournament champion, [[Texas Tech University|Texas Tech]] before beating number two seed [[Baylor University|Baylor]] in the tournament championship game,<ref name="burson" >{{cite web  | last = Burson  | first =  Randy  | authorlink =  | coauthors =   | title = Packing for the Postseason  | work =   | publisher = 12th Man Foundation  | date =  April 2002  | url =http://www.12thmanfoundation.com/mag/Vol7/vol7no3/flashback.asp  | format =  | doi =  | accessdate = 2007-02-20 }}</ref> where Crite was named the tournament's Most Valuable Player.<ref name="about"/>  Winning the tournament gave the Aggies an automatic berth in the NCAA Tournament,<ref name="burson"/> their last NCAA tournament appearance until 2006.

Crite holds the Aggie record as the all-time leading shot blocker (200).  He is second on the school's list of leading rebounders (913) and for field goal percentage (.562).  He has attempted the third-most number of free throws, with 518 attempts, and is the fourth leading Scorer in school history.<ref name="leader" >{{cite web  | last =   | first =    | authorlink =  | coauthors =   | title = Individual Category Leaders   | work =   | publisher = Texas A&M University Athletic Department  | date =    | url =http://www.aggieathletics.com/records.php?SID=MBB  | format =  | doi =  | accessdate = 2007-02-20 }}</ref>
