== Career ==
[[Image:Isabelle DELOBEL Olivier SCHOENFELDER Grand Prix Final 2008 OD.jpg|thumb|left|Isabelle Delobel and Olivier Schoenfelder at the 2008-09 Grand Prix Final]]

Delobel began skating at age six and began ice dancing after only a year in singles.<ref name=gs020519/> She skated with her brother, Laurent, for three years.<ref name=gs020519/> She later moved to train in [[Lyon]].<ref name=gs020519/>

Delobel and Schoenfelder were paired together in 1990 by coach Lydie Bontemps on the suggestion of [[Irina Moiseeva]] and [[Andrei Minenkov]].<ref name=gs020519/><ref name=bio0910/><ref name=absk2005/> They won a silver medal at [[1996 World Junior Figure Skating Championships|1996 Junior Worlds]] before turning senior prior to the 1996<U+2013>97 season. They won their first Grand Prix medal at the [[1999 Skate Canada International|1999 Skate Canada]]. Early in their career, they were coached by [[Muriel Boucher-Zazoui]] in [[Lyon]], France. [[Tatiana Tarasova]] and [[Nikolai Morozov (figure skater)|Nikolai Morozov]] were their choreographers from 1998<U+2013>2002 and their coaches from 2000<U+2013>2002 in [[Newington, Connecticut]].<ref name=gs020519/><ref name=jbm99/> While practising a lift at French Nationals in December 2001, Delobel tore an abdominal muscle, keeping her off the ice for six weeks and forcing the team to miss the European Championships.<ref name=gs020519/> Feeling more comfortable in France, Delobel and Schoenfelder decided to return to Lyon and Boucher-Zazoui after the 2001<U+2013>2002 season.<ref name=gs020519/>

They won their first national championship in the 2002<U+2013>2003 season. Delobel and Schoenfelder worked with choreographer [[Pasquale Camerlengo]] for the 2005-2006 season.<ref name=abskjan06/>

Delobel and Schoenfelder often finished just outside the medals at major events,<ref name=wgold/> including a 4th place at the [[2006 Olympics]], less than two points behind the bronze medalists.<ref name=06oly/> The following season, they won their only [[2007 European Figure Skating Championships|European title]] but were unable to win a medal at [[2007 World Figure Skating Championships|Worlds]].

Delobel and Schoenfelder did not repeat as European champions the [[2008 European Figure Skating Championships|following year]], finishing second. They then went on to win the [[2008 World Figure Skating Championships|2008 World Championships]]. They were first in both the compulsory and original dance portions of the event, and second in the free dance.<ref name=08wtitle/> They considered retiring but decided to continue competing.<ref name=ic051908/>

[[File:Isabelle Delobel & Olivier Schoenfelder EX Lift - 2007 Europeans.jpg|thumb|right|Delobel and Schoenfelder perform a lift during exhibitions at the [[2007 European Figure Skating Championships|2007 European Championships]].]]

They began the 2008<U+2013>09 season with wins in all three Grand Prix appearances <U+2013> [[2008 Skate America|Skate America]], [[2008 Troph<U+00E9>e Eric Bompard|Troph<U+00E9>e Eric Bompard]], and the [[2008<U+2013>2009 Grand Prix of Figure Skating Final|Grand Prix Final]]. During their gala exhibition performance at the Grand Prix Final in December 2009, Delobel suffered a shoulder injury and underwent surgery on January 5, 2009, causing them to miss the remainder of the season.<ref name=bio0910/><ref name=in030309/>

Delobel became pregnant during the injury layoff.<ref name=nyt022010/> She and Schoenfelder trained cautiously, with [[Marie-France Dubreuil]] substituting for Delobel in lifts.<ref name=ifsmag/> Dubreuil, along with [[Patrice Lauzon]], also choreographed their final free dance.<ref name=ifsmag/> Occasional falls caused Delobel to leave the ice in late July.<ref name=nyt022010/>

Delobel's son was born in October and she returned to the ice toward the end of the month, beginning three-a-day sessions and intense physical training in November.<ref name=nyt022010/> They also skipped [[French Figure Skating Championships|French Nationals]] and the [[2010 European Figure Skating Championships|European Championships]] in order to spend more time on training.<ref name=nyt022010/> The two returned in time for the Vancouver Olympics, competing just four-and-a-half months after she had given birth and announcing it would be their final competition.<ref name=ap021810/> They finished sixth and retired from competitive skating.<ref name=gs022310fd/> They continue to skate together in shows.<ref name=absk2010/>

== Personal life ==
Delobel's twin sister, [[V<U+00E9>ronique Delobel]], also competed in the French national championships<ref name=gs020519/> and internationally.<ref name=icenetprof/>

Delobel married [[Ludovic Roux]], a bronze medalist at the 1998 Olympics in team Nordic combined, in June 2009, and their son, Lo<U+00EF>c, was born on 2 October 2009.<ref name=bio0910/><ref name=ap021810/><ref name=ifs091002/>
