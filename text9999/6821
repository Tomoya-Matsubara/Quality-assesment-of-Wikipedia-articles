'''Geology Hall''', formerly '''Geological Hall''', is a building located in the historic [[Queens Campus]] section of [[Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey]]'s College Avenue Campus in [[New Brunswick, New Jersey]].  Designed by architect [[Henry Janeway Hardenbergh]], Geology Hall was built in 1872 with funds raised by the college's president, [[William H. Campbell]] for the purpose of facilitating the expansion of science and agriculture education.  Rutgers expanded these programs after being named New Jersey's only [[Land-grant university|land grant college]]. As part of the Queen's Campus, Geology Hall was included on the [[New Jersey Register of Historic Places]] and the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1973.

At present, the building houses administrative offices and the university's geological museum. The museum, which is among the oldest collegiate geology collections in the United States, was founded by state geologist and Rutgers professor [[George Hammell Cook]] in 1872. It features exhibits on [[geology]], [[paleontology]], and [[anthropology]], with an emphasis on the [[natural history]] of New Jersey, that include fluorescent zinc minerals from [[Franklin, New Jersey|Franklin]] and [[Ogdensburg, New Jersey|Ogdensburg]], a dinosaur trackway discovered in [[Towaco, New Jersey|Towaco]], a [[mastodon]] from [[Salem County, New Jersey|Salem County]], and a [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic era]] Egyptian [[mummy]].

In 1864, Rutgers College was named New Jersey's sole [[Land-grant university|land grant college]] which provided federal funding pursuant to the [[Morrill Land-Grant Acts|Morrill Act of 1862]] for the development of engineering, scientific, agricultural, and military education at one school in each state.<ref name="McCormickBicenHistory">McCormick, Richard P.
