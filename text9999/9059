"'''Ojos As<U+00ED>'''" ({{lang-en|Eyes Like Those}}) is a song in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] by the [[Colombia]]n singer [[Shakira]], and was released as the fourth single from her album ''[[<U+00BF>D<U+00F3>nde Est<U+00E1>n los Ladrones?]]'' on July 23, 1999.  Today, "Ojos As<U+00ED>" is one of Shakira's most successful songs of her career.  The song reached the top spot in countries such as Argentina, Colombia, Mexico, and even Romania, and fared well within the US [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' charts]], [[Hot Latin Song]], and [[Latin Pop Airplay]].   The music video for "Ojos As<U+00ED>" features a red-haired Shakira with a more rock image, aside from a silver belly dancing hip scarf.  Shakira's 2001 English language debut album, ''[[Laundry Service]]'', features an English version of the song titled "'''Eyes Like Yours'''", which is believed to have been recorded around the same time as "Ojos As<U+00ED>" when Shakira was considering translating her Spanish material.  Shakira has performed "Ojos As<U+00ED>" in each of her world tours, most recently{{when|date=August 2011}} in her [[The Sun Comes Out World Tour]].


==Song information==
"Ojos As<U+00ED>" contains interludes of [[Arabic language|Arabic]] chants (contrary to popular belief, these were not written and sung by famous Egyptian singer [[Amr Diab]]). It is based in the [[Phrygian dominant scale]] to help lend to the song's famous [[Arabian music|Arabian feel]].  Shakira herself sings in Arabic in the album version, single version, and various remixes of the song.


'''The song follows a very clear pattern:'''

-main slow, Middle Eastern introduction

-second intro, featuring a beat

-verse (with an accordion between the lines)

-bridge featuring Arabic shouts of "ya hey, ya hey, ya la hey!" by either male background vocalists or Shakira, depending on the version

-chorus (featuring a line in Arabic by male background vocalists)

-wordless vocal bridge

-verse (with an accordion between the lines)

-bridge featuring Arabic shouts of "ya hey, ya hey, ya la hey!" by either male background vocalists or Shakira, depending on the version

-chorus (featuring a line in Arabic by male background vocalists)

-wordless vocal bridge

-violin solo

-Shakira singing in Arabic or a dance break, depending on the version

-chorus repeats (number of times depending on the version)


"Ojos As<U+00ED>" became extremely popular in Latin American countries and is one of Shakira's biggest hits in Spanish. It was also one of Shakira's smash hits in Romania.<ref>http://stiri.kappa.ro/magazin/07-07-2006/shakira-vine-la-timisoara-cu-prietenul-ei-99178.html {{dead link|date=May 2011}}</ref>

==Music video==

The music video for "Ojos As<U+00ED>" features Shakira performing the song for a crowd.  In the background is a giant [[neon]] eye, which shoots out sparks and catches fire toward the end of the video.  There are also clips of Shakira [[belly dancing]] in front of a dark purple background, standing in water.  In these clips, there are snakes painted down her arms and red lines painted on her head. The video uses the "Single Mix" version of the song (though versions of the video with the album mix also exist).  Featured instruments in the video include an Arabic string instrument with a bowl under the head, and a [[Danelectro]] Longhorn [[electric bass guitar]].  Shakira's long-time musical partner and band manager [[Tim Mitchell]] can be seen playing guitar in the video.  The video won the International Viewer's Choice Award (North) at the [[2000 MTV Video Music Awards]], while it was also nominated for the same award in the South category.

On April 24th, 2012, an alternate version of the video surfaced online.  Uploaded by the video's director, Mark Kohr, on video sharing site Vimeo, this new version was in widescreen, revealing more of the original picture, and also contained several short, but noticeable, different scenes from the original full-screen, 4:3 version.

Shakira completely re-worked the song for her ''[[MTV Unplugged]]'' in 1999.  This new version of the song, the finale of the concert, was much quieter than the original version and its remixes, and it included an extended introduction after the main Middle Eastern beginning, and even a dance break with Middle Eastern drums, eliminating Shakira singing in Arabic at the same time.  This version of the song set the basic structural standard for future versions.

The [[Tour Anfibio]] version of Ojos As<U+00ED> was not very different from Unplugged's.  The main differences between the two were Anfibio's  brief, mysterious violin solo before the main intro, and the presence of an electric guitar or two since Unplugged's acoustic restrictions were obviously not in place.

The [[Tour of the Mongoose]]'s version took the Unplugged/Anfibio version of the song, and built upon it dramatically.  The pre-song introduction (which was also the introduction to the concert itself, as "Ojos As<U+00ED>" was the opening number), was fast instrumental rock that would quiet down to a somewhat long violin solo, which then would lead into "Ojos As<U+00ED>" itself after an immense instrumental build-up.  The song's second intro (after the main Middle Eastern one) featured new choreography and a more defined beat, and the overall instrumentation was much fuller and rich-sounding, breaking more away from Unplugged's acoustic sound.  However, the version still stayed true to the song's Middle Eastern flair (including an original Middle Eastern melody being played along with the drums of the dance break, which also had slightly altered choreography), though interestingly, the accordion in the middle of the verses was absent.  Shakira would wear tight black leather pants, a black belly dancing scarf, and a black bra.

The Oral Fixation Tour's version (an encore after the main setlist) also had a pre-song intro, using popular Arabian tune "Enta Omri" by famous Egyptian singer [[Om Kalthoum]].  Shakira danced to "Enta Omri" with a purple veil (this intro is thus known as the "Veil Dance").  "Enta Omri" would then become Ojos Asi with a bang as Shakira would throw the veil up into the air and spin off-stage as "Ojos As<U+00ED>"'s first intro played.  What followed wasn't very different from the Tour of the Mongoose's version, beyond the accordion in the middle of the verses being added again.  Shakira would wear purple pants, a golden/purple hip scarf, and a silver or rainbow bra.

Shakira's [[The Sun Comes Out World Tour]] featured a dramatically reworked version of the song.  Although the structure was quite similar to the song's live versions since MTV Unplugged, the instrumentation was quite different.  After a lengthy and elegant solo by violinist [[Una Palliser]], the song would begin, the first main intro quite similar to previous tours.  However, as the beat kicked in, the drums would be much heavier, and as the song progressed, the instrumentation would become much more electronic.  Gone were the [[oud]]s, Middle Eastern drums, and accordions, and half way through the tour, the entire second verse and chorus of the song were removed.  The tour's version also featured a new dance break, using excerpts from the piece "Move" by Middle Eastern DJ Said Mrad.  Finally, Shakira would sing the chorus twice at the end of the song, instead of just once.  Before its removal, the tour's signature prop, a giant head behind the stage, would feature mystical eyes and patterns during the song.  Shakira would wear a black skirt, an animal-print skirt over that, a silver belly dancing scarf, and a skin-colored bra.

Notable performances of "Ojos As<U+00ED>" include Shakira's performance of the song at the [[Latin Grammy Awards of 2000]], in which she performed a slightly shortened, yet showstopping, rendition similar to the Tour Anfibio version.  Also to be noted is the version at the [[Rock in Rio]] music festival in 2008, which featured a reworked, more Middle Eastern instrumentation, and a featured Middle Eastern vocalist (a similar version was also performed at a [[New Year's Eve]] celebration in [[Abu Dhabi]] later that year).  At the two 2010 [[Rock in Rio]] festivals in [[Lisbon]] and [[Madrid]], and also at the legendary [[Glastonbury Festival]] (also in 2010), the song opened the concerts with a new Middle Eastern intro.  At Glastonbury, the song was shortened similar to how it would eventually be during [[The Sun Comes Out World Tour]].

Ojos As<U+00ED>'s "Single Version", used for a version of the song's music video and promotional singles, contains a somewhat different introduction from the album version, replacing the three notes of accordion with  one note on the violin in the song's introduction.  The Single Version also has a slightly altered, more electronic arrangement.  There are several other official remixes of the song, including the lengthy "Thunder Mix" and extra-Arabian "Mirage Mix".  Other official remixes include the popular Meme remixes and the Desert Dub.  Various other unofficial remixes also exist.

Shakira's 2001 [[English language]] debut album, ''[[Laundry Service]]'', features an English version of the song titled "'''Eyes Like Yours'''", which is believed to have been recorded around the same time as "Ojos As<U+00ED>" when Shakira was considering translating her Spanish material.  "Eyes Like Yours" contains no differences from "Ojos As<U+00ED>" besides each song's respective language (both still feature the Arabic).  The rough, yet literal (in most places) translation of Ojos As<U+00ED> was written by Shakira and [[Gloria Estefan]], and was most likely recorded as far back as in 1998.  "Eyes Like Yours" has an unreleased music video that was filmed around the same time as "Ojos As<U+00ED>"'s (as Shakira looks the same in both videos).  A clip of this unseen video was released on a promotional CD for "[[Laundry Service]]", only a minute in length, and containing very few shots of Shakira singing in English.
