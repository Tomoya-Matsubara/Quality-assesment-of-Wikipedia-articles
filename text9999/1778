As a result, he began playing soccer and [[basketball]].<sup>[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Crew+Goalie+Presthus+Joins+The+Financial+Solutions+Network+in+Dublin-a0112176648]</sup>  Presthus attended [[Southern Methodist University]], playing on the men<U+2019>s soccer team from 1993 to 1996.  He completed his [[bachelor<U+2019>s degree]] in finance in 1997.  At some point, he also played with the [[Minnesota Thunder]] of [[USISL]] before entering [[Major League Soccer]].

==MLS==
In February 1997, [[D.C. United]] selected Presthus in the second round (20th overall) of the [[1997 MLS College Draft]].  Presthus spent most of the 1997 as a backup to [[Scott Garlick]].  However, by the end of the 1998 season, he had begun to emerge as United<U+2019>s top goalkeeper and the team traded Garlick during the off-season.  On February 5, 2001, United traded Presthus and a tenth round [[2001 MLS SuperDraft]] pick to the [[Columbus Crew]] for third round pick in the [[2001 MLS SuperDraft]].  Presthus became the Crew<U+2019>s starting goalkeeper, but on July 23, 2003 he tore the ulnar collateral ligament in his right elbow during a game.  He underwent surgery on September 30, 2003, but the rehabilitation went much slower than he expected.  As a result, he announced his his retirement on January 14, 2004.<sup>[http://www.usatoday.com/sports/soccer/mls/crew/2004-01-15-presthus-retires_x.htm]</sup>
