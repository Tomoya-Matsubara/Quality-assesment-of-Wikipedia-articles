<sup>[[Help:Japanese|?]]</sup>, also frequently ''I<U+014D>jima'' {{Audio|ja-Iwo Jima.ogg|<small>listen</small>}}: "[[sulfur]] island") is an island of the [[Japan]]ese [[Volcano Islands]] chain, which makes up the southern end of the [[Ogasawara Islands]]. The island is located 1,200 kilometers (650 [[nautical mile]]s) south of mainland [[Tokyo]] and administered as part of [[Bonin Islands|Ogasawara]], one of eight villages of Tokyo. It is famous as the site of the February<U+2013>March 1945 [[Battle of Iwo Jima]] between the United States and Japan during [[World War II]], when the iconic photograph ''[[Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima]]'' was taken. The U.S. [[Military occupation|occupied]] Iwo Jima until 1968, when it was returned to Japan.  


== Name ==
Iwo Jima was traditionally called ''Iw<U+014D>t<U+014D>'' (''I<U+014D>t<U+014D>''). Prior to Japan's 1946 orthography reform, a historical spelling resulted in (approximately) ''Iw<U+014D>t<U+014D>'' (modern ''I<U+014D>t<U+014D>''). An alternative, ''Iw<U+014D>jima'' (modern ''I<U+014D>jima'')<U+2014>where ''jima'' is an alternative pronunciation of {{Nihongo|''t<U+014D>''|<U+5CF6>| island}}<U+2014>also appeared in nautical atlases.<ref name="Greimel">{{cite news

Japanese naval officers who arrived to fortify the island before the American invasion mistakenly called it ''Iwo Jima''.<ref name="Greimel"/>
In this way, the "Iwo Jima" pronunciation became mainstream and was the one used by American forces who arrived during [[World War II]]. Former island residents protested against this rendering, and the [[Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport]]'s [[Geographical Survey Institute]] debated the issue and formally announced on [[June 18]], [[2007]], that the official Japanese pronunciation of the island's name would be reverted to the pre-war ''I<U+014D>t<U+014D>''.<ref name="GSI"/>
Moves to revert the pronunciation were sparked by the high profile films ''[[Flags of Our Fathers (film)|Flags of Our Fathers]]'' and ''[[Letters from Iwo Jima]]''.<ref name="Greimel"/> The change does not affect how the name is written in {{Nihongo|Japanese|<U+786B><U+9EC4><U+5CF6>|}}, only how it is pronounced.

== History ==
=== Before 1945 ===
Before [[World War II]], Iwo Jima was administered (as it is today) by the prefectural government of Tokyo. A census in June 1943 reported an island civilian population of 1018 (533 males, 485 females) in 192 households in six settlements. The island had a primary school, a shinto shrine, and a single police officer; it was serviced by a mail ship from [[Haha-jima]] once a month, as well as a [[Nippon Yusen]] ship once every couple of months. The island's economy relied upon [[sulfur]] mining, [[sugarcane]] farming, and [[fishing]]; an isolated island in the middle of the Pacific Ocean with poor economic prospect, Iwo Jima had to import all [[rice]] and consumer goods from the [[Home Islands]].{{Fact|date=March 2009}}

Even before the beginning of World War II, there was a garrison of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] at the southern part of Iwo Jima. It was off-limits to the island's civilian population, who had little contact with the naval personnel in any case, except for trade purposes.

Throughout 1944 there was a massive military buildup on Iwo Jima, in anticipation of an American invasion; in July its civilian population was forcibly evacuated, and no civilians have settled permanently on the island ever since.

=== The Battle of Iwo Jima ===
{{main|Battle of Iwo Jima}}
The invasion of Iwo Jima began on [[February 19]], [[1945]], and continued to [[March 26]], [[1945]]. The battle was a major initiative of the [[Pacific War|Pacific Campaign]] of World War II. The Marine invasion, known as [[Operation Detachment]], was charged with the mission of capturing the [[airbase|airfield]]s on the island which up until that time had harried U.S. bombing missions to Tokyo. Once the bases were secured, they could then be of use in the impending invasion of the Japanese mainland.

The battle was marked by some of the fiercest fighting of the War. The [[Imperial Japanese Army]] positions on the island were heavily [[Fortification|fortified]], with vast [[bunker]]s, hidden [[artillery]], and 18 kilometers (11&nbsp;mi) of tunnels.<ref>[http://www.worldwar2database.com/html/letters_from_iwo_jima.htm Letters From Iwo Jima] World War II Multimedia Database</ref><ref>[http://www.battle-fleet.com/pw/his/Battle-Iwo-Jima-Defense.htm Japanese Defense of Iwo Jima]</ref> The battle was the first American attack on the Japanese [[Home Islands]] and the Imperial soldiers defended their positions tenaciously.  Of the 21,000 Japanese soldiers present at the beginning of the battle, over 20,000 were killed and only 1,083 taken [[POW|prisoner]].<ref name="morison">{{cite book | last = Morison | first = Samuel Eliot | authorlink = Samuel Eliot Morison | origyear = 1960 | year = 2002 | title = Victory in the Pacific, 1945, ''vol. 14 of ''[[History of United States Naval Operations in World War II]] | publisher = University of Illinois Press | location = Urbana, Ill. | isbn = 0252070658 | oclc = 49784806 }}</ref> 

One of the first objectives after landing on the beachhead was the taking of Mount Suribachi. At the second raising of a flag on the peak, [[Joe Rosenthal]] photographed five [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]]: [[Ira Hayes]], [[Mike Strank]], [[Rene Gagnon]], [[Harlon Block]], [[Franklin Sousley]], and [[U.S. Navy]] [[corpsman]] [[John Bradley (Navy)|John Bradley]] [[Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima|raising the U.S. flag]] on the  fourth day of the battle (February 23). The photograph was extremely popular, being reprinted in thousands of publications. It won the [[Pulitzer Prize for Photography]] that same year, and ultimately came to be regarded as one of the most significant and recognizable images of the war, and possibly the most reproduced photograph of all time.<ref name="ap">[http://www.ap.org/pages/about/pulitzer/rosenthal.html Fifty Years Later, Iwo Jima Photographer Fights His Own Battle]</ref> 

Within the next month of fighting, 3 of the 6 soldiers raising the flag were killed.

After the fall of Mt. Suribachi in the south, the Japanese still held a strong position throughout the island. General [[Tadamichi Kuribayashi]] still had the equivalent of eight infantry battalions, a tank regiment, two artillery and three heavy mortar battalions, plus the 5,000 gunners and naval infantry. With the landing area secure, more troops and heavy equipment came ashore and the invasion proceeded north to capture the airfields and the remainder of the island. Most Japanese soldiers fought to the death. On the night of [[March 25]], a 300-man Japanese force launched a final counterattack. The Marines suffered heavy casualties; more than 100 were killed and another 200 Americans were wounded. The island was officially declared "secured" the following day. The number of American casualties was greater than the total Allied casualties at [[Normandy Landings|Battle of Normandy]] on [[D-Day]]. 

Even after Iwo Jima was about to be declared secured, about three thousand Japanese soldiers were left alive in the island's warren of caves and tunnels.  Those who could not bring themselves to commit suicide hid in the caves during the day and came out at night to prowl for provisions.  Some did eventually surrender and were surprised that the Americans often received them with compassion, offering water, cigarettes, or coffee.<ref name=Toland>{{cite book | first = John | last = Toland | title = The Rising Sun: The Decline and Fall of the Japanese Empire 1936-1945 | location = New York | publisher = Random House | year = 1970 | pages = 731 | isbn =  | oclc = 105915 }}</ref>  The last of these stragglers, two of Lieutenant Toshihiko Ohno's (whose body was never found) men, Yamakage Kufuku and Matsudo Linsoki, lasted six years, surrendering in 1951<ref>Toland, p. 737</ref> (another source gives the date of surrender as [[January 6]], [[1949]]).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.wanpela.com/holdouts/profiles/kufuku.html | first = Donald | last = Cook | title = Capture of Two Holdouts [[January 6]], [[1949]] | work = No Surrender: Japanese Holdouts | date = | accessdate = 2007-09-11 }}</ref>

The U.S. military [[Military occupation|occupied]] Iwo Jima until 1968, when it was returned to Japan.

=== Reunion of honor ===
On [[February 19]], [[1985]], the 40th anniversary of the day that U.S. forces began the assault on the island, veterans from both forces gathered for the Reunion of Honor just a few meters away from the spot where [[U.S. Marines]] had landed on the island.<ref name="Boardman">{{cite web

During the memorial service a granite plaque was unveiled with the message:<blockquote>On the 40th anniversary of the battle of Iwo Jima, American and Japanese veterans met again on these same sands, this time in peace and friendship. We commemorate our comrades, living and dead, who fought here with bravery and  honor, and we pray together that our sacrifices on Iwo Jima will always be remembered and never be repeated.</blockquote>

It is inscribed on both sides of the plaque, with the English translation facing the beaches where U.S. forces landed and the Japanese translation facing inland, where Japanese troops defended their position.

After that, the Japan-U.S. combination memorial service of the 50th anniversary was held in front of this monument in March 1995. The 55th anniversary was held in 2000, followed by a 60th reunion in March 2005 (see U.S. National Park Service photo below).

=== Naval air base ===
The [[Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force]] (JMSDF) operates a naval air base on the island at [[North Field (Iwo Jima)|North Field]] {{airport codes|IWO|RJAW}}. The airstrip is 2,650 meters (8,700&nbsp;ft) long and 60 meters (200&nbsp;ft) wide. Its orientation is 07/25. The JMSDF is in charge of support, air-traffic control, fueling, and rescue. The [[Japan Air Self-Defense Force]] also uses the base. The [[Japan Ground Self-Defense Force]] is in charge of explosive-[[ordnance disposal]]. 400 Japanese troops are stationed on the island.<ref name="Greimel"/> Two abandoned airfields from World War II are located nearby, [[Central Field (Iwo Jima)|Central Field]] to the south of the current air base, and an unfinished Japanese airfield to the north of the base, which was improved following the US invasion of the island.

The U.S. Navy's [[Carrier Air Wing Five]], based at the United States [[Naval Air Facility Atsugi]] when not embarked/deployed aboard [[USS George Washington (CVN-73)|USS George Washington]], also uses the base for field carrier landing practice (FCLP). The [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] still has a {{convert|1639|acre|km2}} disfunctioned communication facility (Iwo-Jima Communication Site) on the island, while the [[U.S. Coast Guard]]'s [[Iwo Jima LORAN-C transmitter]] facility was transferred to Japan in 1993 and demolished in 1994.

Civilian access to the island is restricted to those attending memorial services for American and Japanese fallen soldiers, construction workers for the naval air base, and [[Japan Meteorological Agency|meteorological agency]] officials. The Japanese troops stationed on the island register their [[J<U+016B>minhy<U+014D>|residential addresses]] in [[Ayase, Kanagawa]] or [[Sayama, Saitama]] for voting, tax, and social security purposes. Officially, there is no population on the island.

=== U.S. nuclear arms base ===
Iwo Jima appears to be one of a number of Japanese islands which has been used by the United States to host [[nuclear arms]], according to Robert S. Norris, William M. Arkin, and William Burr writing for the ''[[Bulletin of Atomic Scientists]]'' in early 2000.<ref name="Norris-know">{{cite journal

This is despite a Japanese policy of not allowing nuclear weapons on Japanese soil. Whether the site is currently used for this purpose is unknown, as great secrecy surrounds the United States<U+2019> siting of nuclear arms bases; but on [[December 12]], [[1999]], U.S. Undersecretary for Defense Policy Walter Slocombe told The New York Times, <U+201C>Our position is that there have been no violations of our obligations under the security treaty and related arrangements.<U+201D><ref name="Acronym">{{cite journal

Norris, Arkin, and Burr, concluded however:<blockquote>There were nuclear weapons on [[Chichi Jima]] and Iwo Jima (Iwo To), an enormous and varied nuclear arsenal on [[Okinawa]], nuclear bombs (without their fission cores) stored on the mainland at [[Misawa Air Base|Misawa]] and [[Itazuki Air Base|Itazuki]] airbases (and possibly at [[Naval Air Facility Atsugi|Atsugi]], [[Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni|Iwakuni]], [[Iruma Air Base|Johnson]], and [[Komaki]] airbases as well), and nuclear-armed U.S. Navy ships stationed in [[United States Fleet Activities Sasebo|Sasebo]] and [[United States Fleet Activities Yokosuka|Yokosuka]]. ''[<U+2026>]'' It is true that Chichi Jima, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa were under U.S. occupation, that the bombs stored on the mainland lacked their [[plutonium]] and/ or [[uranium]] [[nuclear warhead|cores]], and that the nuclear-armed ships were a legal inch away from Japanese soil. All in all, this elaborate stratagem maintained the technicality that the United States had no nuclear weapons <U+201C>in Japan.<U+201D><ref name="Acronym"/></blockquote>

== Iwo Jima in popular culture ==
Iwo Jima is in the book ''[[Flags of Our Fathers]]'' (2000) and the movie based on it ''[[Flags of Our Fathers (film)|Flags of Our Fathers]]'' (2006). The movie ''[[Letters from Iwo Jima]]'' (2006) is based on a Japanese book of letters, some of which were the final letter, by Japanese soldiers. Both films were directed by [[Clint Eastwood]]. 

A 2005 documentary ''The League of Grateful Sons'' was shot during the 60th Anniversary trip. (Vision Forum also featured that trip as one of the episodes in its ongoing radio drama series Jonathan Park (The return to Iwo Jima).) 

The island is in the [[John Wayne]] film ''[[Sands of Iwo Jima]]'' (1948).
