The '''Fields Medal''', officially known as '''International Medal for Outstanding Discoveries in Mathematics''', is a prize awarded to two, three, or four [[mathematician]]s under 40 years of age at the [[International Congress of Mathematicians|International Congress]] of the [[International Mathematical Union]] (IMU), a meeting that takes place every four years. The Fields Medal is sometimes viewed as the highest honour a mathematician can receive.<ref>{{cite journal| title = 2006 Fields Medals awarded | journal = [[Notices of the American Mathematical Society]]| volume = 53|issue = 9|publisher= [[American Mathematical Society]]|date=October 2006 | url = http://www.ams.org/notices/200609/comm-prize-fields.pdf| pages= 1037<U+2013>1044|format=PDF}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/technology/story/2006/08/22/math-fields.html|title=Reclusive Russian turns down math world's highest honour|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=22 August 2006|accessdate=26 August 2006}}</ref> The Fields Medal and the [[Abel Prize]] have often been described as the "mathematician's [[Nobel Prize]]" (but different at least for the age restriction).

The prize comes with a monetary award, which since 2006 has been C$15,000 (in [[Canadian dollar]]s).<ref name="BBC">{{cite news|title= Maths genius turns down top prize |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/5274040.stm| publisher = BBC|date= 22 August 2006 | accessdate =22 August 2006}}</ref><ref>[http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Article.aspx?id=185366 Israeli wins 'Nobel' of Mathematics], JPost.com</ref> The colloquial name is in honour of [[Canada|Canadian]] mathematician [[John Charles Fields]].<ref name="Fields Institute About Us">{{cite web|url=http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/aboutus/jcfields/fields_medal.html |title=About Us: The Fields Medal | publisher = The Fields Institute, [[University of Toronto]] |accessdate=21 August 2010}}</ref> Fields was instrumental in establishing the award, designing the medal itself, and funding the monetary component.<ref name="Fields Institute About Us" />

The medal was first awarded in 1936 to Finnish mathematician [[Lars Ahlfors]] and American mathematician [[Jesse Douglas]], and it has been awarded every four years since 1950. Its purpose is to give recognition and support to younger mathematical researchers who have made major contributions.

In 2014 [[Maryam Mirzakhani]] became the first woman as well as the first Iranian, and [[Artur Avila]] became the first mathematician from Latin America  to be awarded a Fields Medal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mathunion.org/general/prizes/2014/ |title=International Mathematical Union (IMU): 2014 |publisher=Mathunion.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=jobs |url=http://www.nature.com/news/iranian-is-first-woman-to-nab-highest-prize-in-maths-1.15686 |title=Iranian is first woman to nab highest prize in maths : Nature News & Comment |doi=10.1038/nature.2014.15686 |publisher=Nature.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-14}}</ref>

== Conditions of the award ==
The Fields Medal is often described as the "[[List of prizes known as the Nobel of a field|Nobel Prize of Mathematics]]" and for a long time was regarded as the most prestigious award in the field of mathematics.<ref>{{cite news|url = http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/13/science/13prof.html|title = Journeys to the Distant Fields of Prime| first = Kenneth | last=Chang| work= The New York Times|date = 12 March 2007}}</ref> However, in contrast to the [[Nobel Prize]], the Fields Medal is awarded only every four years.  The Fields Medal also has an age limit: a recipient must be under age 40 until 1 January of the year in which the medal is awarded (similar to the [[Clark Medal]] in economics). The under 40 rule is based on Fields' desire that "while it was in recognition of work already done, it was at the same time intended to be an encouragement for further achievement on the part of the recipients and a stimulus to renewed effort on the part of others."<ref>{{Harvnb|McKinnon Riehm|Hoffman|2011|p=183}}</ref>

The monetary award is much lower than the 8,000,000 [[Swedish kronor]] (roughly 1,400,000 [[Canadian dollar]]s)<ref>On 1 April 2014 at 15:32 UTC, 8,000,000 Swedish kronor was worth $1,360,970 Canadian according to the [[OANDA]] currency converter.</ref> given with each Nobel prize as of 2014.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/about/amounts/index.html

In 1954, [[Jean-Pierre Serre]] became the youngest winner of the Fields Medal, at 27. He still retains this distinction.

In 1966, [[Alexander Grothendieck]] boycotted the ICM, held in Moscow, to protest Soviet military actions taking place in Eastern Europe.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Jackson | first = Allyn | authorlink = |date=October 2004 | title = As If Summoned from the Void: The Life of Alexandre Grothendieck| journal = [[Notices of the American Mathematical Society]] | volume = 51 | issue = 9 | page = 1198 | doi = | url = http://www.ams.org/notices/200410/fea-grothendieck-part2.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate =26 August 2006 | quote = }}</ref> [[L<U+00E9>on Motchane]], founder and director of the [[Institut des Hautes <U+00C9>tudes Scientifiques]] attended and accepted Grothendieck's Fields Medal on his behalf.<ref>{{cite web|title=This Mathematical Month - August|url=http://www.ams.org/samplings/this-math-month/thismathmonth-aug|publisher=[[American Mathematical Society]]}}</ref>

In 1970, [[Sergei Novikov (mathematician)|Sergei Novikov]], because of restrictions placed on him by the Soviet government, was unable to travel to the congress in [[Nice]] to receive his medal.

In 1978, [[Grigory Margulis]], because of restrictions placed on him by the Soviet government, was unable to travel to the congress in [[Helsinki]] to receive his medal. The award was accepted on his behalf by [[Jacques Tits]], who said in his address: "I cannot but express my deep disappointment <U+2014> no doubt shared by many people here <U+2014> in the absence of Margulis from this ceremony. In view of the symbolic meaning of this city of Helsinki, I had indeed grounds to hope that I would have a chance at last to meet a mathematician whom I know only through his work and for whom I have the greatest respect and admiration."<ref>[http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Margulis.html Margulis biography], School of Mathematics and Statistics, University of St Andrews, Scotland. Retrieved 27 August 2006.</ref>

In 1982, the congress was due to be held in [[Warsaw]]  but had to be rescheduled to the next year, because of [[Martial law in Poland|martial law]] introduced in Poland 13 Dec 1981. The awards were announced at the ninth General Assembly of the IMU earlier in the year and awarded at the 1983 Warsaw congress.

In 1990, [[Edward Witten]] became the first and so far only [[physicist]] to win this award.

In 1998, at the ICM, [[Andrew Wiles]] was presented by the chair of the Fields Medal Committee, [[Yuri I. Manin]], with the first-ever IMU silver plaque in recognition of his proof of [[Fermat's Last Theorem]]. [[Don Zagier]] referred to the plaque as a "quantized Fields Medal". Accounts of this award frequently make reference that at the time of the award Wiles was over the age limit for the Fields medal.<ref>[http://wwwa.britannica.com/eb/article-9090319 Wiles, Andrew John], Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica. Retrieved 27 August 2006.</ref>  Although Wiles was slightly over the age limit in 1994, he was thought to be a favorite to win the medal; however, a gap (later resolved by [[Richard Taylor (mathematician)|Taylor]] and Wiles) in the proof was found in 1993.<ref>[http://www.icm2002.org.cn/general/prize/medal/1998.htm  Fields Medal Prize Winners (1998)]{{dead link|date=August 2014}}, 2002 International Congress of Mathematicians.

In 2006, [[Grigori Perelman]], who proved the [[Poincar<U+00E9> conjecture]], refused his Fields Medal<ref name="BBC"/> and did not attend the congress.<ref>{{cite news | last = Nasar | first = Sylvia |author2=Gruber, David | title = Manifold Destiny: A legendary problem and the battle over who solved it. | work = [[The New Yorker]] | date = 21 August 2006 | url = http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/articles/060828fa_fact2 | accessdate =24 August 2006 }}{{dead link|date=August 2014}} (dead link).

In 2014, [[Maryam Mirzakhani]] became the first woman and [[Artur Avila]] the first [[South America|south american]] to win the Fields Medal, .

== The medal ==
[[Image:FieldsMedalBack.jpg|thumb|right|The reverse of the Fields Medal]]

The medal was designed by Canadian sculptor [[R. Tait McKenzie]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/aboutus/jcfields/fields_medal.html |title=Fields Institute - The Fields Medal |publisher=Fields.utoronto.ca |date=9 August 1932 |accessdate=21 August 2010}}</ref>

* On the obverse is [[Archimedes]] and a quote attributed to [[Marcus Manilius]] which reads in Latin: "Transire suum pectus mundoque potiri" (Rise above oneself and grasp the world).  The date is written in Roman numerals and contains an error ("MCNXXXIII" rather than "MCMXXXIII").<ref>EBERHARD KNOBLOCH. Generality and Infinitely Small Quantities in Leibniz's Mathematics: The Case of his Arithmetical Quadrature of Conic Sections and Related Curves. In Infinitesimal Differences: Controversies between Leibniz and his Contemporaries. Edited by Ursula Goldenbaum and Douglas Jesseph. Walter de Gruyter, 2008</ref>

* On the reverse is the inscription (in Latin):
: {{lang|la|CONGREGATI}}
: {{lang|la|EX TOTO ORBE}}
: {{lang|la|MATHEMATICI}}
: {{lang|la|OB SCRIPTA INSIGNIA}}
: {{lang|la|TRIBUERE}}

Translation: "Mathematicians gathered from the entire world have awarded [understood 'this prize'] for outstanding writings."

In the background, there is the representation of Archimedes' [[Archimedes#Biography|tomb]], with the carving illustrating his theorem [[Archimedes#Writings|on the sphere and the cylinder]],  behind a branch. (This is the mathematical result of which Archimedes was reportedly most proud: Given a sphere and a circumscribed cylinder of the same height and diameter, the ratio between their volumes is equal to <U+2154>.)

The rim bears the name of the prizewinner.
