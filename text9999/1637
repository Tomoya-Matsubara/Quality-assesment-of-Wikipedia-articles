The '''878th Bombardment Squadron''' is an inactive [[United States Air Force]] unit.  It was last assigned to the [[499th Bombardment Group]].  It was inactivated at [[March Field]], [[California]] on 16 February 1946.

==History==
Established in late 1943 as a [[B-29 Superfortress]] Very Heavy bombardment Squadron;  trained under Second Air Force. Underwent an extended training period while B-29 Aircraft were manufactured and development difficulties corrected.

Deployed to [[Saipan]] in September 1944  and numerous missions in daylight, operating from high altitude to bomb strategic targets in [[Japan]].   Later, began low-level night raids, flying at low altitude to drop incendiaries on area targets. Completed a series of attacks against enemy airfields on Ky<U+016B>sh<U+016B> to aid the Allied assault on [[Okinawa]] in April 1945.  Also dropped propaganda leaflets on Japan, and after the war dropped food and supplies to Allied prisoners of war.

Returned to the United States in November, 1945, being assigned to [[March Field]], [[California]]. It was assigned to the [[Fourth Air Force]] of [[Continental Air Forces]]. Demobilization, however, was in full swing and the squadron turned in its aircraft and was inactivated on 16 February 1946.
