In their relationship, they have always respected each other's advice.<ref name=MOSHR/>  She requested that Barack, who was then her [[fianc<U+00E9>]], meet her prospective boss when considering her first career move.<ref name=FLIW/>  Now, she is her husband<U+2019>s closest advisor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=3199620|title=Michelle Obama: 'I've Got a Loud Mouth'|accessdate=2008-02-12|date=[[2007-05-22]]|publisher=ABCNews Internet Ventures|author=[[Robin Roberts]]}}</ref><ref name=MOSHR/> Early in the presidential race she did not portray herself as an advisor, however. In fact, she was quoted in interviews saying <U+201C>My job is not a senior adviser.<U+201D><ref name=MOpuric/>

==Career==
Following law school, she was an associate at the Chicago office of the law firm Sidley Austin where she first met her husband. At the firm, she worked on marketing and intellectual property and was assigned as Barack Obama's summer advisor.<ref name="womanbehind" /> Subsequently, she held [[public sector]] positions in the Chicago city government as an Assistant to the [[Mayor of Chicago|Mayor]] and Assistant Commissioner of Planning and Development. In 1993, she became Executive Director for the Chicago office of Public Allies, a [[non-profit organization]] encouraging young people to work on social issues in nonprofit groups and government agencies.<ref name=West />

In 1996, Obama served as the Associate Dean of Student Services at the [[University of Chicago]], where she developed the University's Community Service Center.<ref>University of Chicago Chronicle [http://chronicle.uchicago.edu/960606/obama.shtml Obama named first Associate Dean of Student Services]</ref> In 2002, she began working for the University of Chicago Hospitals, first as executive director for community affairs and, beginning May, 2005, as Vice President for Community and External Affairs.<ref>[http://www.uchospitals.edu/news/2005/20050509-obama.html University of Chicago Medical Center: Michelle Obama appointed vice president for community and external affairs at the University of Chicago Hospitals<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

After her husband's second book ''[[The Audacity of Hope: Thoughts on Reclaiming the American Dream]]'', the couple bought a home in the part of the [[Kenwood, Chicago|Kenwood]] community area that is considered part of [[Hyde Park, Chicago|Hyde Park]].<ref name=MOSHR>{{cite web|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB120269904120358135.html|title=Michelle Obama Solidifies Her Role|accessdate=2008-02-12|date=[[2008-02-11]]|author=Langley, Monica|publisher=[[Dow Jones & Company|Dow Jones & Company, Inc.]]|work=[[Wall Street Journal]]}}</ref>  A later transaction to expand their property has become controversial.  In June 2005 the Obamas and the wife of [[Antoin Rezko]] closed on adjacent properties in Kenwood.  The Obamas paid [[U.S. Dollar|$]]1.65 million for a brick [[Georgian revival]] mansion and the Rezkos paid $625,000 for the adjacent undeveloped lot.  In January 2006, Obama paid the Rezkos $104,500 for a strip of their parcel to increase the size of the their sideyard.  The transaction occurred at a time when Rezko was under investigation.  Rezko and Barack Obama had been friends since 1990 and Rezko had raised over $60,000 for Obama during his political career to that point.  Obama paid Rezko more than the [[appraised value]] for the parcel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.suntimes.com/news/politics/124171,CST-NWS-obama05.article|title=Obama on Rezko deal: It was a mistake|accessdate=2008-02-12|date=[[2006-11-05]]|publisher=Digital Chicago, Inc.|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|author=McKinney, Dave and Chris Fusco}}</ref>  Rezko has since been indicted on [[corruption]] charges by a [[federal grand jury]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://i.abcnews.com/Blotter/story?id=4111483&page=1|title=The Rezko Connection: Obama's Achilles Heel?|accessdate=2008-02-12|date=[[2008-01-10]]|author=Ross, Brian and Schwartz, Rhonda|publisher=ABCNews Internet Ventures}}</ref>

==Political activities==
In May 2007, which was three months after Barack<U+2019>s declaration of his candidacy, she reduced her professional responsibilities by 80% to support her husband<U+2019>s [[Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2008|presidential campaign]].<ref name=FLIW>{{cite web|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2007/12/michelle_obama200712|title=First Lady in Waiting|publisher=Cond<U+00E9>Net|work=[[Vanity Fair]]|accessdate=2008-02-12|date=[[2007-12-27]]|author=Bennetts, Lisa}}</ref>  Early in the campaign, she had limited involvement in which she only traveled to political events two days a week and only stayed away nights if her daughters could come along.<ref name=MOMtBOD2008C/> In early February 2008, she attended thirty-three events in eight days.<ref name=MOSHR/>

In 2007, Obama gave political [[stump speech (politics)|stump speeches]] for her husband's presidential campaign at various locations in the United States. Jennifer Hunter of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' wrote about one speech of hers in [[Iowa]], "Michelle was a firebrand, expressing a determined passion for her husband's campaign, talking straight from the heart with eloquence and intelligence."<ref>[http://www.suntimes.com/news/hunter/518408,CST-NWS-hunter21.article Michelle gets stronger all the time :: CHICAGO SUN-TIMES :: Jennifer Hunter<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  She employs an all-female staff of [[aide]]s for her political role.<ref name=MOSHR/>  She negotiated an agreement in which her husband gave up smoking in exchange for her support as a Presidential aspirant.<ref name=MOoCF>{{cite web|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB120248883340754123.html|title=Michelle Obama on Campaign, Family|accessdate=2008-02-12|date=[[2008-02-11]]|publisher=[[Dow Jones & Company|Dow Jones & Company, Inc.]]|work=[[Wall Street Journal]]}}</ref>

This is her first election year on the national political scene and even before the field of [[United_States_Democratic_presidential_candidates%2C_2008|Democratic candidates]] was narrowed to two she was considered the least famous of the candidates' [[spouse]]s.<ref name=MOpuric>{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/20041755/|title=Michelle Obama plays unique role in campaign|accessdate=2008-02-12|date=[[2007-07-30]]|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|work=[[MSNBC]]|author=Zakin, Carly}}</ref>  Early in the 2008 presidential campaign, she exhibited her [[sarcasm]] and told anecdotes about the Obama family life.
