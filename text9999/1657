Major '''Michael Augustus Fox-Pitt-Rivers''' (27 May 1917 &ndash; December 1999) was a [[West Country]] landowner who gained notoriety in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] in the 1950s when he was put on trial charged with [[buggery]]. This trial was instrumental in bringing public attention<U+2014>and opposition<U+2014>to the laws against [[homosexuality]] as they then stood.  

Pitt-Rivers was the son of Captain George Henry Lane Fox-Pitt-Rivers and the Hon. Emily Rachel Forster, who died in 1979. A West Country landowner and conservationist of colourful antecedents, his great-grandfather was Lt-Gen [[Augustus Pitt Rivers|A.H. Lane Fox Pitt-Rivers]] whose [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] collection, donated to [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]] in 1883, formed the basis of the [[Pitt Rivers Museum]] named after him.<ref name=Peerage/> He served in [[World War II]], and in 1946 gained the Substantive rank of [[Captain (army)|Captain]].<ref>[http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/37422/supplements/341] The ''[[London Gazette]]'' 4 January 1946</ref>

In the summer of 1953, [[Edward_Douglas-Scott-Montagu%2C_3rd_Baron_Montagu_of_Beaulieu|Lord Montagu of Beaulieu]] offered his friend [[Peter Wildeblood]] the use of a beach hut near his country estate. Wildeblood brought with him two young [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] servicemen, Edward McNally and John Reynolds. The foursome were joined by Montagu's cousin Michael Pitt-Rivers. At the subsequent trial the two airmen turned [[Turn state's evidence|Queen's Evidence]] and claimed there had been dancing and "abandoned behaviour" at the gathering. Wildeblood said it had in fact been "extremely dull." Montagu claimed that it was all remarkably innocent, saying: "We had some drinks, we danced, we kissed, that's all."<ref name=Mail>''[[Daily Mail]]'': [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-468385/Lord-Montagu-court-case-ended-legal-persecution-homosexuals.html "Lord Montagu on the court case which ended the legal persecution of homosexuals," 17 July 2007]</ref>

Arrested on 9 January 1954, in March of that year Pitt-Rivers was brought before the [[United Kingdom|British]] courts charged with "conspiracy to incite certain male persons to commit serious offences with male persons" or "[[buggery]]". It was the first time this charge had been used in a British court since the trials of [[Oscar Wilde]] in 1895 and it led to public criticism that the police were pursuing a [[McCarthyism|McCarthy-like]] purge of [[High society (group)|Society]] homosexuals.<ref name=Mail/>

Pitt-Rivers was charged along with [[Edward_Douglas-Scott-Montagu%2C_3rd_Baron_Montagu_of_Beaulieu|Lord Montagu of Beaulieu]] and [[Peter Wildeblood]]. Pitt-Rivers and Lord Montagu denied the charges and denied also that they were homosexual.<ref>[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=nCpMNSGhXy0C&pg=PA444&lpg=PA444&dq=pitt-rivers+wildeblood&source=bl&ots=MQJK2NMtCW&sig=tZv34gXpVMcE3VR134BHoslLy5I&hl=en&ei=tRMiTN3AJMjKjAfTlYyxAQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CCMQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=pitt-rivers%20wildeblood&f=false] Aldrich, Robert and Wotherspoon, Garry ''Who's Who in Contemporary Gay and Lesbian History: from World War II to the Present Day'' Routledge (2000), 445</ref> After an eight-day trial held at the Winchester Assizes, on 24 March 1954 Pitt-Rivers and Wildebood were sentenced to 18 months and Lord Montagu to 12 months in prison as a result of these and other charges. Their case led eventually to the [[Wolfenden Report]], which in 1957 recommended the decriminalisation of homosexuality in the [[United Kingdom]]. 

Michael Pitt-Rivers married [[Sonia Brownell]], the widow of [[George Orwell]], in 1958. They were divorced in 1965.<ref name=Peerage>[http://thepeerage.com/p6854.htm] Pitt-Rivers on The Peerage website</ref><ref>[http://www.lrb.co.uk/v24/n08/jenny-diski/dont-think-about-it Diski, Jenny 'Don<U+2019>t Think About It' a review of ''The Girl from the Fiction Department: A Portrait of Sonia Orwell'' by Hilary Spurling,

In 1991 he began the restoration of the [[Larmer Tree Gardens]], which had been in a state of neglect since the death of his grandfather in 1900. The gardens reopened to the public in 1995.<ref>Garden Visit: [http://www.gardenvisit.com/garden/larmer_tree_garden "Larmer Tree Gardens"]</ref><ref>[http://www.ucl.ac.uk/prehistoric/past/past34.html "Larmer Tree Gardens on 'Past'"- the Newsletter of The Prehistoric Society (April 2000)]</ref> He spent most of his adult life with his partner, William Davis, who inherited his estate on his death.<ref name=Pitt>[http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/outdoors-the-thrill-of-the-chase-1170311.html "Outdoors: The thrill of the Chase" ''[[The Independent]]'' 8 August 1998]</ref> 

His role in the 1967 decriminalisation of homosexuality in the United Kingdom was explored in the 2007 [[Channel Four]] [[docudrama]] ''[[A Very British Sex Scandal]]''.<ref>Internet Movie Database: [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1074218/ ''A Very British Sex Scandal'']</ref>
