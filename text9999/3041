'''Kiev''' or '''Kyiv''' ({{lang-uk|<U+041A><U+0438><U+0457><U+0432>}} {{IPA-uk|<U+02C8>k<U+026A>jiw||Kyiv.ogg}}; {{lang-ru|<U+041A><U+0438><U+0435><U+0432>}}; (see also [[Names of European cities in different languages: I<U+2013>L#K|Cities' alternative names]])) is the [[Capital city|capital]] and the largest city of [[Ukraine]], located in the north central part of the country on the [[Dnieper River]]. The population as of the 2001 [[census]] was 2,611,300. However, higher numbers have been cited in the press.<ref name="population">The most recent [[Ukrainian Census (2001)|Ukrainian census]], conducted on December 5, 2001, gave the population of Kiev as 2611.3 thousand ([http://ukrcensus.gov.ua/eng/regions/reg_mkyiv/ Ukrcensus.gov.ua <U+2013> Kyiv city] URL accessed on August 4, 2007). Estimates based on the amount of bakery products sold in the city (thus including temporary visitors and commuters) suggest a minimum of 3.5 million.

Kiev is an important [[industry|industrial]], [[science|scientific]], [[education]]al and [[culture|cultural]] centre of [[Eastern Europe]]. It is home to many [[High tech|high-tech]] industries, [[higher education]] institutions and world-famous historical landmarks. The city has an extensive infrastructure and highly developed system of [[public transport]], including the [[Kiev Metro]].

The name Kiev is said to derive from the name of [[Kyi, Schek and Khoryv|Kyi]], one of four legendary founders of the city (brothers Kyi, Shchek, Khoryv, and sister Lybid). During [[History of Kiev|its history]], Kiev, one of the oldest cities in [[Eastern Europe]], passed through several stages of great prominence and relative obscurity. The city probably existed as a commercial centre as early as the 5th century. A [[Slavs|Slavic]] settlement on the great trade route between [[Scandinavia]] and [[Constantinople]], Kiev was a tributary of the [[Khazars]],<ref>[http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/kiev Columbia Encyclopedia, article Kiev]</ref> until seized by the [[Varangians]] ([[Vikings]]) in the mid 9th century. Under [[Varangians]] rule, the city became a capital of the [[Kievan Rus'|Rus']], the first [[East Slavs|East Slavic]] state. Completely destroyed during the [[Mongol invasion of Rus'|Mongol invasion]] in 1240, the city lost most of its influence for the centuries to come. It was a provincial capital of marginal importance in the outskirts of the territories controlled by its powerful neighbours; first the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], followed by [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|Poland]] and [[Russian Empire|Russia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/317542/Kiev |title=Kiev (Ukraine) - Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-02}}</ref>

The city prospered again during the [[Russian Empire]]'s [[Industrial Revolution|industrial revolution]] in the late 19th century. In 1917, after the [[Ukrainian National Republic]] declared independence from the Russian Empire, Kiev became its capital. And from 1921 onwards Kiev was an important city of the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]], and, from 1934, its capital. During [[Eastern Front (World War II)|World War II]], the city again suffered significant damage, but quickly recovered in the post-war years, remaining the third largest city of the [[Soviet Union]]. Following the [[Collapse of the Soviet Union (1985<U+2013>1991)|collapse of the Soviet Union]] and the [[History of Ukraine|Ukrainian independence]] of 1991, Kiev remained the capital of [[Ukraine]].

Kiev is one of the oldest cities of [[Eastern Europe]] and has played a pivotal role in the development of the medieval [[East Slavs|East Slavic]] civilization as well as in the modern [[Ukraine|Ukrainian nation]].

It is believed{{by whom|date=November 2010}} that Kiev was founded in 482 CE. The origin of the city is obscured by legends, one of which tells about a founding-family consisting of a Slavic tribe leader Kyi, the eldest, his brothers Schek and Khoriv, and also their sister Lybid, who founded the city (The [[Primary Chronicle]]). According to it the name Kyiv/Kiev means to "belong to Kyi". Some claim to find reference to the city in Ptolemy<U+2019>s work as the Metropolity (the 2nd century).<ref>Wilson, Andrew (2000). ''The Ukrainians. Unexpected Nation''. Yale University Press. ISBN 0-300-08355-6</ref>

The non-legendary time of the founding of the city is harder to ascertain. Scattered [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] settlements existed in the area from the 6th century, but it is unclear whether any of them later developed into the city. 8th century fortifications were built upon a [[Slav (village)|Slavic]] settlement apparently abandoned some decades before. It is still unclear whether these fortifications were built by the [[Slavic peoples|Slavs]] or the [[Khazars]]. If it was the Slavic peoples then it is also uncertain when Kiev fell under the rule of the [[Khazars|Khazar]] empire or whether the city was, in fact, founded by the [[Khazars]]. The [[Primary Chronicle]] (a main source of information about the early history of the area) mentions Slavic Kievans telling [[Askold and Dir]] that they live without a local ruler and pay a tribute to the [[Khazars]] in an event attributed to the 9th century. At least during the 8th and 9th centuries Kiev functioned as an outpost of the Khazar empire. A hill-fortress, called Sambat (Old Turkic for "High Place") was built to defend the area. At some point during the late ninth or early tenth century Kiev fell under the rule of [[Varangians]] (see [[Askold and Dir]], and [[Oleg of Novgorod]]) and became the nucleus of the Rus' polity. The date given for Oleg's conquest of the town in the Primary Chronicle is 882, but some historians, such as [[Omeljan Pritsak]] and [[Constantine Zuckerman]], dispute this and maintain that Khazar rule continued as late as the 920s (documentary evidence exists to support this assertion <U+2014> see the [[Kievian Letter]] and [[Schechter Letter]].) Other historians suggest that the Magyar tribes ruled the city between 840 and 878, before migrating with some [[Khazars|Khazar]] tribes to [[Hungary]].

[[File:Kiev downtown.jpg|thumb|left|Kiev in the late 19th century]]

During the eighth and ninth centuries, Kiev was an outpost of the [[Khazars|Khazar]] empire. Starting in the late ninth century or early tenth century Kiev was ruled by the [[Varangians|Varangian]] nobility and became the nucleus of the [[Rus (name)|Rus']] polity, whose 'Golden Age' (eleventh to early twelfth centuries) has from the nineteenth century become referred to as [[Kievan Rus']]. In 968, the nomadic [[Pechenegs]] attacked and then [[Siege of Kiev (968)|besieged the city]].<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20091027115640/http://www.geocities.com/egfroth1/Pechenegs The Pechenegs], Steven Lowe and Dmitriy V. Ryaboy</ref> In 1203 Kiev was captured and burned by Prince [[Rurik Rostislavich]] and his [[Kipchaks|Kipchak]] allies. In the 1230s the city was besieged and ravaged by different Russian princes several times. In 1240 the [[Mongol invasion of Rus'|Mongol invasion of Rus]] led by [[Batu Khan]] completely [[Siege of Kiev (1240)|destroyed Kiev]],<ref>[https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/citd/RussianHeritage/4.PEAS/4.L/12.III.5.html The Destruction of Kiev], University of Toronto Research Repository</ref> an event that had a profound effect on the future of the city and the [[Culture of ancient Rus|East Slavic civilization]]. At the time of the Mongol destruction, Kiev was reputed as one of the largest cities in the world, with a population exceeding one hundred thousand.

[[File:Kiev Radyanskaya pl approx1930.jpg|thumb|right|Kiev's council chambers in 1930]]

In the early 1320s, a Lithuanian army led by [[Gediminas]] defeated a Slavic army led by Stanislav of Kiev at the [[Battle on the Irpen' River]], and conquered the city. The Tatars, who also claimed Kiev, retaliated in 1324<U+2013>1325, so while Kiev was ruled by a Lithuanian prince, it had to pay a tribute to the [[Golden Horde]]. Finally, as a result of the [[Battle of Blue Waters]] in 1362, Kiev and surrounding areas were incorporated into the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] by [[Algirdas]], Grand Duke of Lithuania.<ref>Jones, Michael (2000).

In the [[Russian Empire]] Kiev was a primary [[Christian]] centre, attracting [[pilgrim]]s, and the cradle of many of the empire's most important religious figures, but until the 19th century the city's commercial importance remained marginal.

In 1834, the Saint Vladimir University was established; it is now called the [[Taras Shevchenko National University of Kiev]] after the Ukrainian poet [[Taras Shevchenko]]. Shevchenko was a field researcher and editor for the geography department.

During the 18th and 19th centuries city life was dominated by the [[Armed Forces of the Russian Federation|Russian military]] and ecclesiastical authorities; the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] formed a significant part of Kiev's infrastructure and business activity. In the late 1840s, the historian, [[Nikolay Kostomarov|Mykola Kostomarov]] ''({{lang-ru|Nikolay Kostomarov}})'', founded a secret political society, the Brotherhood of [[Saints Cyril and Methodius|Saint Cyril]] and [[Saints Cyril and Methodius|Methodius]], whose members put forward the idea of a federation of free Slavic people with Ukrainians as a distinct and separate group rather than a subordinate part of the Russian nation; the society was quickly suppressed by the authorities.

Following the gradual loss of Ukraine's autonomy, Kiev experienced growing Russification in the 19th century by means of Russian migration, administrative actions and social modernization. At the beginning of the 20th century, the city centre was dominated by the Russian-speaking part of the population,{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} while the [[Social class|lower classes]] living on the outskirts retained Ukrainian [[folk culture]] to a significant extent.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} However, enthusiasts among ethnic Ukrainian nobles, military and merchants made recurrent attempts to preserve native culture in Kiev (by clandestine book-printing, amateur theatre, folk studies etc.)

[[File:Kiev 24.7.1990 Ukrainian Flag.JPG|right|upright|thumb|The Ukrainian national flag was raised outside Kiev's City Hall for the first time on 24 July 1990]]

During the Russian industrial revolution in the late 19th century, Kiev became an important trade and transportation centre of the [[Russian Empire]], specialising in sugar and grain export by railway and on the Dnieper river. As of 1900, the city had also become a significant industrial centre, having a population of 250,000. Landmarks of that period include the railway infrastructure, the foundation of numerous educational and cultural facilities as well as notable architectural monuments (mostly merchant-oriented). The [[Kiev tram|first electric tram line]] of the Russian Empire was established in Kiev (arguably, the first in the world).

Kiev prospered during the late nineteenth century [[Industrial Revolution|industrial revolution]] in the [[Russian Empire]], when it became the third most important city of the Empire and the major centre of commerce of its southwest. In the [[Ukraine after the Russian Revolution|turbulent period]] following the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|1917 Russian Revolution]], Kiev became the capital of several [[Ukrainian People's Republic|short-lived Ukrainian states]] and was caught in the middle of several conflicts: [[World War I]], the [[Russian Civil War]], and the [[Polish<U+2013>Soviet War|Polish-Soviet War]].
Kiev changed hands sixteen times from the end of 1918 to August 1920.<ref>{{cite book |title=Walking Since Daybreak|last=Eksteins|first=Modris|year=1999|publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|Houghton Mifflin]]|isbn=061808231X|page=87}}</ref>

Starting in 1921, the city was a part of the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]], a founding republic of the [[Soviet Union]]. Kiev was greatly affected by all the major processes that took place in Soviet Ukraine during the [[interwar period]]: the 1920s [[Ukrainization]] as well as the migration of the rural [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainophone]] population made the [[Russophone]] city Ukrainian-speaking and propped up the development of the [[Ukrainian culture|Ukrainian cultural life]] in the city; the [[History of the Soviet Union (1927<U+2013>1953)|Soviet Industrialization]] that started in the late 1920s turned the city, a former centre of commerce and religion, into a major industrial, technological and scientific centre, the [[Holodomor|1932<U+2013>1933 Great Famine]] devastated the part of the migrant population not registered for the ration cards, and [[Joseph Stalin]]'s [[Great Purge]] of 1937<U+2013>1938 almost eliminated the city's [[intelligentsia]]<ref name="Brama">{{cite web |url=http://www.brama.com/ukraine/history/terror/index.html |title=The Great Purge under Stalin 1937<U+2013>38 |publisher=www.brama.com |accessdate=2010-01-14 }}</ref><ref name="Figes">[[Orlando Figes]] ''The Whisperers: Private Life in Stalin's Russia'', 2007, ISBN 0-08050-7461-9, pages 227<U+2013>315.</ref><ref name="Social Catastrophe">Robert Gellately, ''Lenin, Stalin, and Hitler: The Age of Social Catastrophe'' (Knopf, 2007: ISBN 1400040051), 720 pages.</ref>

In 1934 Kiev became the capital of Soviet Ukraine. The city boomed again during the years of the Soviet industrialization as its population grew rapidly and many industrial giants were created, some of which exist to this day.

In [[Eastern Front (World War II)|World War II]], the city again suffered significant damage, and was occupied by [[Nazi Germany]] from 19 September 1941 to 6 November 1943. Shortly after the city was occupied, a team of [[NKVD]] officers that had remained hidden dynamited most of the buildings on the Khreshchatyk, the main street of the city, most of whose buildings were being used by German military and civil authorities; the buildings burned for days and 25,000 people were left homeless, and in retaliation the Germans rounded up all the local Jews they could find and massacred them at [[Babi Yar]].<ref>Andy Dougan, ''Dynamo: Triumph and Tragedy in Nazi-Occupied Kiev'' (Globe Pequot, 2004: ISBN 1592284671), p. 83.</ref><ref>Samuel W. Mitcham, ''The Rise of the Wehrmacht: The German Armed Forces and World War II'', Vol. 1 (ABC-CLIO, 2008: ISBN 027599659X), p. 539.</ref>

Kiev quickly recovered in the post-war years, becoming once again the third most important city of the Soviet Union. The [[Chernobyl disaster|catastrophic accident at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant]] occurred only {{convert|100|km|mi|lk=out|abbr=on}} north of the city. However, the prevailing northward winds blew most of the radioactive debris away from the city.

In the wake of the [[Collapse of the Soviet Union (1985<U+2013>1991)|collapse of the Soviet Union]] the [[Declaration of Independence of Ukraine]] was proclaimed in the city by the [[Verkhovna Rada|Ukrainian parliament]] on August 24, 1991. Kiev is the capital of independent [[Ukraine]].

Modern Kiev is a mix of the old and the new, seen in everything from the architecture to the stores and to the people themselves. Experiencing rapid population growth between the 1970s and the mid-1990s, the city has continued its consistent growth after the turn of the millennium. As a result, Kiev's central districts provide a dotted contrast of new, modern buildings amongst the pale yellows, blues and grays of older apartments. Urban sprawl has gradually reduced, while population densities of suburbs has increased. The most expensive properties are located in the [[Pechersk]], and [[Khreshchatyk]] areas. It is also prestigious to own a property in newly constructed buildings in the [[Kharkivskyi neighborhood, Kiev|Kharkivskyi Raion]] or [[Obolon Raion|Obolon]] along the Dnieper.

[[Declaration of Independence of Ukraine|Ukrainian independence]] at the turn of the [[2000|millennium]] has heralded other changes. Western-style residential complexes, modern [[nightclub]]s, classy restaurants and prestigious hotels opened in the centre. Music from [[Europe]] and [[North America]] started appearing on Ukrainian music charts. And most importantly, with the easing of the visa rules in 2005,<ref>[http://www.workpermit.com/news/2005_08_10/europe/ukraine.htm Workpermit.com]. Retrieved July 30, 2006.</ref> Ukraine is positioning itself as a prime tourist attraction, with Kiev, among the other large cities, looking to profit from new opportunities. The centre of Kiev has been cleaned up and buildings have been restored and redecorated, especially the [[Khreshchatyk]] street and the [[Maidan Nezalezhnosti|Independence Square]]. Many historic areas of Kiev, such as [[Andriyivskyy Descent]], have become popular street vendor locations, where one can find traditional [[Art of Ukraine|Ukrainian art]], religious items, books, game sets (most commonly [[chess]]) as well as [[jewellery]] for sale.<ref>[http://www.kiev.info/shopping/andrey_sp.htm ''Kiev.info''].

Kiev's most famous historical architecture complexes are the [[Saint Sophia's Cathedral, Kiev|St. Sophia Cathedral]] and the [[Kiev Pechersk Lavra]] (Monastery of the Caves), which are recognized by [[UNESCO]] as a [[World Heritage Site]].
[[File:Kiev city evening.jpg|thumb|right|Newly constructed high-rise office buildings in Kiev]]
Noteworthy historical architectural landmarks also include the [[Mariyinsky Palace]] (designed and constructed from 1745 to 1752, then reconstructed in 1870), several [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox churches]] such as [[St. Michael's Golden-Domed Monastery|St. Michael's Cathedral]], [[St Andrew's Church, Kiev|St. Andrew's]], [[St Volodymyr's Cathedral|St. Vladimir's]], the reconstructed [[Golden Gate, Kiev|Golden Gate]] and others.

One of Kiev's widely recognized modern landmarks is the highly visible giant [[Mother Motherland, Kiev|Mother Motherland]] statue made of titanium standing at the [[Museum of the Great Patriotic War, Kiev|Museum of the Great Patriotic War]] on the Right bank of the [[Dnieper River]]. Other notable sites is the cylindrical Salut hotel, located across from Glory Square and the [[eternal flame]] at the World War Two memorial [[Tomb of the Unknown Soldier]], and the [[House with Chimaeras]].

Among Kiev's best-known monuments are [[Mikhail Mikeshin|Mikeshin]]'s statue of [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]] astride his horse located near [[Saint Sophia's Cathedral, Kiev|St. Sophia Cathedral]], the venerated [[Vladimir I of Kiev|Vladimir the Great]] (St. Vladimir), the [[Christianization of Kievan Rus'|baptizer of Rus']], overlooking the river above [[Podil]], the monument to [[Kyi, Schek and Khoryv]] and Lybid, the legendary founders of the city located at the Dnieper embankment. On [[Maidan Nezalezhnosti|Independence Square]] in the city centre, two monuments elevate two of the city protectors; the historic protector of Kiev [[Michael (archangel)|Michael Archangel]] atop a reconstruction of one of the old city's gates and a modern invention, the goddess-protector [[Berehynia]] atop a tall column.

===Geography===
[[File:Kiev L7 20010914.jpg|thumb|right|[[Landsat 7]] image of Kiev and the [[Dnieper River]].]]

Geographically, Kiev belongs to the [[Polesia]] ecological zone (a part of the European mixed woods). However, the city's unique landscape distinguishes it from the surrounding region.

Kiev is located on both sides of the [[Dnieper River]], which flows south through the city towards the [[Black Sea]]. The older right-bank (''western'') part of the city is represented by numerous woody hills, ravines and small rivers. It is a part of the larger Dnieper Upland adjoining the western bank of the Dnieper in its mid-flow. Kiev expanded to the Dnieper's lowland left bank (''to the east'') only in the 20th century. Significant areas of the left-bank Dnieper valley were artificially sand-deposited, and are protected by [[dam]]s.

The Dnieper River forms a branching system of [[tributary|tributaries]], isles, and harbors within the city limits. The city is adjoined by the mouth of the [[Desna River]] and the [[Kiev Reservoir]] in the north, and the [[Kaniv Reservoir]] in the south. Both the Dnieper and Desna rivers are [[navigation|navigable]] at Kiev, although regulated by the reservoir shipping locks and limited by winter freeze-over.

In total, there are 448 bodies of open water within boundaries of Kiev, which include Dnieper itself, its reservoirs, and several small rivers, dozens of [[lake]]s and artificially created [[pond]]s. They occupy 7949 hectares of territory. Additionally, the city boasts of 16 developed [[beach]]es (totalling 140 hectares) and 35 near-water recreational areas (covering more than 1000 hectares). Many are used for pleasure and recreation, although some of the bodies of water are not suitable for swimming.<ref>{{cite web|author=Design by Maxim Tkachuk, web-architecture by Volkova Dasha, templated by Alexey Kovtanets, programming by Irina Batvina, Maxim Bielushkin, Sergey Bogatyrchuk, Vitaliy Galkin, Victor Lushkin, Dmitry Medun, Igor Sitnikov, Vladimir Tarasov, Alexander Filippov, Sergei Koshelev |url=http://korrespondent.net/kyiv/155583 |title=<U+0413><U+0434><U+0435> <U+0432> <U+041A><U+0438><U+0435><U+0432><U+0435> <U+043B><U+0443><U+0447><U+0448><U+0435> <U+043D><U+0435> <U+043A><U+0443><U+043F><U+0430><U+0442><U+044C><U+0441><U+044F> <U+00BB> <U+041D><U+043E><U+0432><U+043E><U+0441><U+0442><U+0438> <U+0432> <U+041A><U+0438><U+0435><U+0432><U+0435> <U+2013> <U+041A><U+043E><U+0440><U+0440><U+0435><U+0441><U+043F><U+043E><U+043D><U+0434><U+0435><U+043D><U+0442> |publisher=Korrespondent.net |date= |accessdate=2009-06-23}}</ref>

==Government==
{{Main|Legal status and local government of Kiev}}
The [[municipality]] of the city of Kiev has a special legal status within Ukraine compared to the other [[Administrative divisions of Ukraine|administrative subdivisions of the country]]. The most significant difference is that the city is subordinated directly to the national-level branches of the [[Government of Ukraine]], skipping the [[oblast|regional level authorities]] of [[Kiev Oblast]]. Additionally, the Head of City Administration<U+2014>the leading executive position is held by a directly elected, rather than appointed, figure, who is also the Head of City Council<U+2014>the [[Mayor of Kiev]], and municipal institutions have a higher level of self governance than elsewhere in Ukraine.

===Subdivisions===
{{See also|:Category:Neighborhoods and raions of Kiev}}
{{Main|Subdivisions of Kiev}}
The first known formal subdivision of Kiev dates to 1810 when the city was subdivided into 4 parts: [[Pechersk]], Starokyiv, and the first and the second parts of [[Podil]]. In 1833<U+2013>1834 according to [[Russian tsar|Tsar]] [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]]'s decree, Kiev was subdivided into 6 police raions; later being increased to 10. As of 1917, there were 8 Raion Councils (''Duma''), which were reorganised by [[bolshevik]]s into 6 Party-Territory Raions.

Over the Soviet time, as city was expanding, the number of raions was gradually increasing. The raions has been also commonly named after Soviet party leaders, and as political situation was changing and some leaders were overturned by the other, so raion names were also changing.

The last raion reform took place in 2001 when the number of raions has been decreased from 14 to 10.

Under [[Oleksandr Omelchenko]] ([[Mayor of Kiev|mayor]] from 1999 to 2006), there were further plans for the merger of some raions and revision of their boundaries, and the total number of raions had been planned to be decreased from 10 to 7. With the election of the new mayor-elect ([[Leonid Chernovetskyi|Leonid Chernovetsky]]) in 2006, these plans were conducted.

====Formal subdivision====
Administratively, the city is divided into "[[raion]]s" ("districts"), which have their own [[local government|locally elected governments]] with jurisdiction over a limited scope of affairs. Presently, there are 10 raions.

[[File:Kiev map english.png|right|thumb|The ten [[Subdivisions of Kiev|raions (boroughs) of Kiev]]]]
Municipal raions (districts) in the city include:

*[[Darnytsia|Darnytskyi Raion]]
*[[Desna Raion|Desnianskyi Raion]]
*[[Dnipro Raion|Dniprovskyi Raion]]
*[[Holosiiv Raion|Holosiivskyi Raion]]
*[[Obolon Raion|Obolonskyi Raion]]
*[[Pechersk, Kiev|Pecherskyi Raion]]
*[[Podil|Podilskyi Raion]]
*[[Shevchenko Raion|Shevchenkivskyi Raion]]
*[[Solomyansk Raion|Solomianskyi Raion]]
*[[Sviatoshyn|Sviatoshynskyi Raion]]

====Informal subdivision====

The [[Dnieper River]] naturally divides Kiev into the Right Bank and the Left Bank areas. Historically located on the western right bank of the river, the city expanded into the left bank only in the twentieth century. Most of the Kiev's attractions as well as the majority of business and governmental institutions are located at the right bank. The eastern Left Bank is predominantly residential. There are large industrial and green areas in both the Right Bank and the Left Bank.

Kiev is further informally divided into historical or territorial neighbourhoods, each housing from about 5,000 to 100,000 inhabitants.

According to the [[Ukrainian Census (2001)|All-Ukrainian Census]], the population of Kiev in 2001 was 2,611,300.<ref name=population/> The historic changes in population is shown in the side table. According to the census men accounted for 1,219,000 persons, or 46.7%, and women for 1,393,000 persons, or 53.3%. Comparing the results with the previous census (1989) shows the trend of [[population ageing]] which, while prevalent throughout the country, is partly offset in Kiev by the inflow of working age migrants.
According to the census data, more than 130 nationalities and ethnic groups reside within the territory of Kiev. Ukrainians constitute the largest [[ethnic group]] in Kiev, and they account for 2,110,800 people, or 82.2% of the population. [[Russians]] comprise 337,300 (13.1%), [[Jews]] 17,900 (0.7%), [[Belarusians]] 16,500 (0.6%), [[Poles]] 6,900 (0.3%), [[Armenians]] 4,900 (0.2%), [[Azerbaijani people|Azerbaijanis]] 2,600 (0.1%), [[Tatars]] 2,500 (0.1%), [[Georgians]] 2,400 (0.1%), [[Moldovans]] 1,900 (0.1%).
Both [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] and [[Russian language|Russian]] are commonly spoken in the city, with Russian being more widely used in the city centre despite the fact that Ukrainian is claimed as their native language by almost three times as many residents as those who claim Russian.<ref name=CensusKiev>According to the official [[Ukrainian Census (2001)|2001 census]] data: {{cite web |url=http://ukrcensus.gov.ua/results/general/nationality/city_kyiv/ |title=<U+0412><U+0441><U+0435><U+0443><U+043A><U+0440><U+0430><U+0457><U+043D><U+0441><U+044C><U+043A><U+0438><U+0439> <U+043F><U+0435><U+0440><U+0435><U+043F><U+0438><U+0441> <U+043D><U+0430><U+0441><U+0435><U+043B><U+0435><U+043D><U+043D><U+044F> 2001 {{!}} <U+0420><U+0435><U+0437><U+0443><U+043B><U+044C><U+0442><U+0430><U+0442><U+0438> {{!}} <U+041E><U+0441><U+043D><U+043E><U+0432><U+043D><U+0456> <U+043F><U+0456><U+0434><U+0441><U+0443><U+043C><U+043A><U+0438> {{!}} <U+041D><U+0430><U+0446><U+0456><U+043E><U+043D><U+0430><U+043B><U+044C><U+043D><U+0438><U+0439> <U+0441><U+043A><U+043B><U+0430><U+0434> <U+043D><U+0430><U+0441><U+0435><U+043B><U+0435><U+043D><U+043D><U+044F> {{!}} <U+043C><U+0456><U+0441><U+0442><U+043E> <U+041A><U+0438><U+0456><U+0432>: |publisher=ukrcensus.gov.ua |accessdate=2010-01-14 }} & {{cite web |url=http://ukrcensus.gov.ua/results/general/language/city_kyiv |title=<U+0412><U+0441><U+0435><U+0443><U+043A><U+0440><U+0430><U+0457><U+043D><U+0441><U+044C><U+043A><U+0438><U+0439> <U+043F><U+0435><U+0440><U+0435><U+043F><U+0438><U+0441> <U+043D><U+0430><U+0441><U+0435><U+043B><U+0435><U+043D><U+043D><U+044F> 2001 {{!}} <U+0420><U+0435><U+0437><U+0443><U+043B><U+044C><U+0442><U+0430><U+0442><U+0438> {{!}} <U+041E><U+0441><U+043D><U+043E><U+0432><U+043D><U+0456> <U+043F><U+0456><U+0434><U+0441><U+0443><U+043C><U+043A><U+0438> {{!}} <U+041C><U+043E><U+0432><U+043D><U+0438><U+0439> <U+0441><U+043A><U+043B><U+0430><U+0434> <U+043D><U+0430><U+0441><U+0435><U+043B><U+0435><U+043D><U+043D><U+044F> {{!}} <U+043C><U+0456><U+0441><U+0442><U+043E> <U+041A><U+0438><U+0457><U+0432>: |publisher=ukrcensus.gov.ua |accessdate=2010-01-14 }} approximately 75% of Kiev's population responded 'Ukrainian' to the native language (ridna mova) census question, and roughly 25% responded 'Russian'.

[[File:Ivan Franko Museum.jpg|thumb|right|Ivan Franko Ukrainian drama theatre]]
Kiev was the historic cultural centre of the [[East Slavs|East Slavic]] civilization and a major cradle for the [[Christianization of Kievan Rus'|Christianization]] for Rus', Kiev retained through centuries its cultural importance and even at times of relative decay, it remained the centre of the [[Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox Christianity]] of the primary importance. Its sacred sites, which include the [[Kiev Pechersk Lavra]] (the Monastery of the Caves) and the [[Saint Sophia's Cathedral, Kiev|Saint Sophia Cathedral]] are probably the most famous, attracted pilgrims for centuries and now recognized as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] remain the primary religious centres as well as the major tourist attraction. The above mentioned sites are also part of the [[Seven Wonders of Ukraine]] collection.

Kiev's theatres include: [[National Opera House of Ukraine|Kiev Opera House]], [[Ivan Franko]] National Academic Drama Theatre, [[Lesya Ukrainka National Academic Theater of Russian Drama]], the Kiev [[Puppet|Puppet Theater]], [[October Palace, Kiev|October Palace]], [[National Philharmonic Society of Ukraine|National Philharmonic of Ukraine]] and others. In 1946 Kiev had four theatres, one opera house and one concert hall.<ref name=life>[http://books.google.com/books?id=iU0EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA120&dq=men%27s+Day+Ukraine&hl=nl&ei=ArJlTfKrNsWbOuSZhYkG&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=8&ved=0CGAQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&q&f=false The Ukraine], [[Life (magazine)|Life]], 28 October 1946</ref> But most tickets then where allocated to "privileged groups".<ref name=life/>

Other significant cultural centres include the [[Dovzhenko Film Studios]], and the Kiev Circus. The most important of the [[:Category:Museums in Kiev|city's many museums]] are the Kiev State Historical Museum, [[Museum of the Great Patriotic War, Kiev|Museum of the Great Patriotic War]], the [[National Art Museum of Ukraine|National Art Museum]], the [[Museum of Western and Oriental Art]], the [[PinchukArtCentre|Pinchuk Art Centre]] and the National Museum of [[Russian culture|Russian art]].

In 2005 Kiev hosted the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2005|50th annual]] [[Eurovision Song Contest]] as a result of [[Ruslana|Ruslana's]] "[[Wild Dances]]" victory in 2004.

There are numerous songs, paintings, photos dedicated to the city. Among them there is an extensive Russian, Ukrainian, Polish folklore, less known are German and Jewish. One of the better songs are called "[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuwFH4KmU1Y&feature=related Without Podil, Kiev is impossible]" (poet L.Dukhovny), "[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hL11BCfprpQ&feature=related How not to love you, Kiev of mine?]" (poet Dmytro Lutsenko), [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMy-xhVe5Yw&feature=player_embedded Khreschatyk] (poet Yuri Rybchynsky), and many others.

==Transportation==
===Local transportation===
[[File:Zoloti Vorota Metro Station Cental Hall.jpg|thumb|right|[[Kiev Metro]], [[Zoloti Vorota (Kiev Metro)|Zoloti Vorota Station]]]]

Public transportation in Kiev includes the [[rapid transit|metro]] (underground), [[bus]]es, [[trolleybus]]es, [[tram]]s and [[funicular]]. The publicly owned and operated [[Kiev Metro]] system is the fastest, the most convenient and affordable network that covers most, but not all, of the city. The metro is continuously expanding towards the city limits to meet growing demand, while the other kinds of public transport are not that well maintained. In particular, the public [[bus]] service has an unreliable schedule. Public electric trolleybus and tram lines are more reliable, but have aged equipment and are underfunded. The historic [[Kiev Tramway|tram system]], which once was a well maintained and widely used method of transport, is now gradually being phased out in favor of buses and trolleybuses.

One unusual mode of public transportation Kiev has is the [[Kiev Funicular|funicular]], that climbs up the steep right bank of the [[Dnieper River]]. It transports 10,000<U+2013>15,000 passengers daily.

[[File:Kiev funicular. Lower station at night.jpg|thumb|left|Kiev Funicular's lower station]]
All public road transport in Kiev is operated by the united ''Kyivpastrans''<ref>See also: [http://www.kpt.kiev.ua/ ''Kyivpastrans'' official website]. Retrieved July 28, 2006.</ref> [[Municipality|municipal]] company. It is heavily subsidized by the city as large groups of passengers (pensioners, etc.) are granted free service on its lines.
The Kiev public transport system uses a simple tariff system regardless of distance travelled: tickets for ground transportation must be purchased each time a vehicle boarded. Discount passes are available for grade school and higher education students. Pensioners use public transportation free. Monthly passes, which are sold at the price of 60 rides, are also available in all combinations of public transportation: metro, bus, trolley and tram.
Recently, privately owned minibuses, ''[[marshrutka]]s'', have appeared on Kiev streets. They provide good coverage of smaller residential streets and have convenient routes. Minibuses take fewer passengers, run faster, stop on demand and are more available, although with an increased frequency of accidents. Ticket price and itinerary of private minibuses are regulated by the city government, and the cost of one ride, while higher than on public buses, is still far lower than in Western Europe.

The [[Taxicab|taxi]] market in Kiev is expansive but not adequately regulated. In particular, the taxi fare per kilometer is not regulated. There is strong competition between private taxi companies. Many allow scheduling a pick-up by phone. Also, it is quite common for a local with a car (or even people from other parts of Ukraine) to provide taxi service on the ''ad hoc'' basis, generally by picking up people looking for a taxi by the roadside. [[Traffic congestion|Traffic jam]]s and lack of parking space are growing problems for taxi services in Kiev. Current regulations allow for parking on pavements, which pedestrians may find inconvenient.

===Suburban transportation===
[[File:Moskovskyj mist (Kyiv).jpg|thumb|right|[[Bridges in Kiev#Moskovskyi Bridge|Moskovskyi Bridge]]]]
[[File:Metro kiev dnipro.JPG|thumb|right|Kiev Metro train arriving at the [[Dnipro (Kiev Metro)|Dnipro]] station]]
[[File:Dniepr river in Kyiv.jpg|thumb|right|Kiev riverport]]
[[File:Iev-Passazhirsiy railway station, Kiev, Ukraine.jpg|thumb|right|[[Kiev Passenger Railway Station|Kiev Railway Station]]]]

Suburban transportation is provided by buses and short-range trains (''[[elektrichka]]s''). There are a few bus stations inside the city providing suburban transportation. Private minibuses (''[[marshrutka]]s'') provide faster and more frequent suburban service, currently winning the competition against large buses.

''Elektrichkas'' are serviced by the publicly owned [[Ukrainian Railways|Ukrzaliznytsia]] company. The suburban train service is fast, and unbeatably safe in terms of traffic accidents. But the trains are not reliable, as they may fail significantly behind schedule, may not be safe in terms of crime, and the ''elektrichka'' cars are poorly maintained and are overcrowded in [[rush hour]]s.

There are 5 ''elektrichka'' directions from Kiev:
* [[Nizhyn]] (north-eastern)
* [[Hrebinka]] (south-eastern)
* [[Myronivka]] (southern)
* [[Fastiv]] (south-western)
* [[Korosten]] (western)

More than a dozen of ''elektrichka'' stops are located within the city allowing residents of different neighborhoods to use the suburban trains.

The previously extensive [[Kiev River Port|riverboat]] service along the Dnieper featuring the Meteor and Raketa hydrofoil ships is no longer available, limiting Kiev's river transport to cargo and tour boats and private pleasure craft.

===Railways===
[[Ukrainian Railways|Railways]] are Kiev<U+2019>s main mode of intercity transportation. The city has a developed railroad infrastructure including a long-distance passenger station, 6 cargo stations, depots, and repairing facilities. However, this system still fails to meet the demand for passenger service. Particularly, the [[Kiev Passenger Railway Station]] is the city's only long-distance passenger terminal (''vokzal'').

Construction is underway for turning the large [[Darnytsia Railway Station]] on the left-bank part of Kiev into a long-distance passenger hub, which may ease traffic at the central station.<ref>{{ru icon}} [http://www.archunion.com.ua/proekt-new-006.shtml Archunion.com.ua]. Retrieved June 20, 2006.</ref> [[Bridges in Kiev|Bridges over the Dnieper River]] are another problem restricting the development of city<U+2019>s railway system. Presently, only one rail bridge out of two is available for intense train traffic. A new combined rail-auto bridge is under construction, as a part of Darnytsia project.

===Air transport===

Air passengers arrive in Kiev through one of two airports: the [[Boryspil International Airport|Boryspil Airport]] which is served by many international airlines, and the smaller [[Kiev International Airport|Zhulyany Airport]], serving mostly domestic flights and limited flights to nearby countries. The international passenger terminal at Boryspil is small, yet modern, being expanded in 2006. There is a separate terminal for domestic flights within walking distance. Passengers flying to other countries from Ukraine usually travel through Boryspil, as other airports in Ukraine such as Donetsk, Simferopol, Odessa, provide very limited international connections. There is also [[Hostomel Airport|Gostomel cargo airport]] in Kiev's north-western suburb of [[Hostomel]].

Kiev is notable in the world of aviation industry as the headquarters for [[Antonov|Antonov aircraft manufacturing company]].

===Roads===
Kiev roads are in poor technical condition and road maintenance is poor. According to the ''Kyivavtodor municipal road corporation'' 80% of the road surfaces in Kiev have been in use for 15 to 30 years, which is from 1.5 to 3 times more than the standard period (12 years).<ref>[http://www.ukranews.com/eng/article/203506.html Kyiv Administration: Roads Are In Poor Technical State Because They Have Reached End Of Their Service Lives And Annual Maintenance Volume Is Low], [[Ukrainian News Agency]] (June 12, 2009)</ref>

===Attractions in Kiev===
It is said that one can walk from one end of Kiev to the other in the summertime without leaving the shade of its many trees. Most characteristic are the [[Aesculus hippocastanum|horse-chestnut]]s ({{lang-uk|<U+043A><U+0430><U+0448><U+0442><U+0430><U+043D><U+0438>, ''kashtany''}}).

Kiev is known as a green city with [[M.M. Gryshko National Botanical Garden|two botanical gardens]] and numerous large and small parks. The [[Museum of the Great Patriotic War, Kiev|World War II Museum]] is located here, which offers both indoor and outdoor displays of military history and equipment surrounded by verdant hills overlooking the Dnieper river.

[[File:Chmielnicki.JPG|thumb|left|[[St. Michael's Golden-Domed Monastery|St. Michael's Golden-Domed Cathedral]] post 1998 reconstruction]]
Among the numerous islands, Venetsianskyi (or [[Hidropark]]) is the most developed. It is accessible by metro or by car, and includes an amusement park, swimming beaches, boat rentals, and night clubs. The Victory Park (''Park Peremohy'') located near Darnytsia subway station is a popular destination for strollers, joggers, and cyclists.
Boating, fishing, and water sports are popular pastimes in Kiev. The area lakes and rivers freeze over in the winter and ice fishermen are a frequent sight, as are children with their ice skates. However, the peak of summer draws out a greater mass of people to the shores for swimming or sunbathing, with daytime high temperatures sometimes reaching 30 to 34 [[Celsius|<U+00B0>C]] (86<U+2013>93&nbsp;[[Fahrenheit|<U+00B0>F]]).{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

The centre of Kiev ([[Maidan Nezalezhnosti|Independence Square]] and [[Khreshchatyk|Khreschatyk Street]]) becomes a large outdoor party place at night during summer months, with thousands of people having a good time in nearby restaurants, clubs and outdoor cafes. The central streets are closed for auto traffic on weekends and holidays.
[[Andriyivskyy Descent]] is one of the best known historic streets and a major tourist attraction in Kiev.

A wide variety of farm produce is available in many of Kiev's farmer markets with the [[Besarabsky Market]] located in the very centre of the city being most famous. Each residential region has its own market, or ''rynok''. Here one will find table after table of individuals hawking everything imaginable: vegetables, fresh and smoked meats, fish, cheese, honey, dairy products such as milk and home-made ''smetana'' (sour cream), [[caviar]], cut flowers, housewares, tools and hardware, and clothing. Each of the markets has its own unique mix of products with some markets devoted solely to specific wares such as automobiles, car parts, pets, clothing, flowers, and other things.

At the city's southern outskirts, near the historic [[Pyrohiv]] village, there is an [[Open-air museum|outdoor museum]], officially called the [[Pyrohiv|Museum of Folk Architecture and Life of Ukraine]] It has an area of {{convert|1.5|km2|sqmi|0}}. This territory houses several "mini-villages" that represent by region the traditional rural architecture of Ukraine.

Kiev also has numerous recreational attractions like bowling alleys, go-cart tracks, paintball venues, billiard halls and even shooting ranges.  The 100-year-old [[Kiev Zoo]] is located on 40 hectares and according to CBC "the zoo has 2,600 animals from 328 species".<ref name=CBCAP>{{cite news|title=Kiev zoo a 'concentration camp for animals'|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/story/2011/03/23/kiev-zoo-deaths.html|accessdate=27 April 2011|newspaper=CBC news|date=23|agency=Associated Press|month=March|year=2011}}</ref>

===Museums===
[[File:Motherland-Kiev.jpg|thumb|right|[[Museum of the Great Patriotic War, Kiev|Museum of the Great Patriotic War]] and [[Mother Motherland, Kiev|Mother Motherland]] monument]]
Kiev is home to some 40 different museums.<ref name="CULKSO">{{cite web|url=http://www.gorstat.kiev.ua/p.php3?c=534&lang=1|title=Culture and Arts|publisher=Kyiv Statistics Office|language=Ukrainian|accessdate=2011-02-23}}</ref> In 2009 they recorded a total of 4.3 million visits.<ref name="CULKSO"/>

The '''[[Museum of the Great Patriotic War, Kiev|Museum of the Great Patriotic War]]''': is a memorial complex commemorating the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Great Patriotic War]] located in the hills on the [[Subdivisions of Kiev#Historical neighborhoods|right-bank]] of the [[Dnieper River]] in [[Pechersk]].

The museum has moved twice before ending up in the current location, where it was ceremonially opened on  May 9, 1981, [[Victory Day (9 May)|Victory Day]], by then [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] leader [[Leonid Brezhnev]]. On June 21, 1996, the museum was accorded its current status as a National Museum by a special decree signed by [[Leonid Kuchma]], the then [[President of Ukraine]]. It is one of the largest museums in Ukraine with over 300,000 exhibits, and is centered around the 62-meter tall Motherland statue, which has become one of the most well known landmarks in the city. The museum has been visited by over 21 million visitors.

[[File:World War II Memorial, Kiev, Ukraine.jpg|thumb|left|Painted battle tanks at the World War II memorial]]
The memorial complex covers the area of 10 hectares (approximately 24.7 [[acre]]s) on the hill, overlooking the [[Dnieper River]]. It contains the giant bowl "The Glory Flame", a site with [[World War II]] [[Military technology and equipment|military equipment]], and the "Alley of the [[Hero City|Hero Cities]]". One of the museums also displays the armaments used by the [[Red Army|Soviet army]] post World War II. The sculptures in the alley depict the courageous defence of the Soviet border from the [[Operation Barbarossa|1941 German invasion]], terrors of the [[Nazism|Nazi]] occupation, [[Soviet partisans|partisan]] struggle, devoted work on the home front, and the [[Lower Dnieper Offensive|1943 Battle of the Dnieper]].

'''[[Kiev Fortress|Kiev fortress]]'''  is the 19th century [[fortification]] buildings situated in [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] capital Kiev, that once belonged to [[western Russian fortresses]]. These structures (once a united complex) were built in the [[Pechersk]] and neighbourhoods by the [[Russian Empire|Russian]] army. Now some of the buildings are restored and turned into [[museum]] called the ''Kiev Fortress'', while others are in use of various military and commercial installations.

[[File:Kiev fortress 002 SHCH.jpg|thumb|right|[[Kiev Fortress|Kiev fortress]]]]
Having lost their military importance in 20th century, buildings continued to be used as [[barracks]], storage and incarceration facilities. However, some of them played independent historical roles. The ''Kosyi Kaponir'' ("Skew [[Caponier]]") became a [[prison]] for the political inmates in the 1900s<U+2013>1920s and was later turned into a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] museum. Now it is the center of the modern museum. A small [[Fortification|fortress]] built in 1872 on the legendary ''[[Lysa Hora]]'' (Bald Mountain) in 1906 became a place of executions for convicted political inmates. It is now a landscape [[park|reserve]] and part of the museum complex.

Constructed in 1898, by architect [[Vladislav Gorodetsky]], the building was originally designed as the museum for the local society of patrons of arts and [[antique]] lovers. The [[fa<U+00E7>ade]] of the building conveys a [[Classical architecture|classic architecture]] form <U+2013> precise reproduction of a six-column porch of [[Doric order]] with [[entablature]], [[triglyph]]s, [[Metope (architecture)|metope]]s and [[frieze]] decoration depicting the Triumph of Arts. The architectural composition featuring figures of [[Griffon|gryphon]]s and large [[concrete]] lions at the top of the stairs were created by an Italian [[Sculpture|sculptor]], [[Emilio Sala]].

[[File:Kiev art museum.jpg|thumb|left|[[National Art Museum of Ukraine]]]]
The '''[[National Art Museum of Ukraine]]''' is a [[museum]] dedicated to Ukrainian [[art]].
Originally called the Kiev City Museum of Antiques and Art, the founders set out to put together a collection of pieces representative of Ukrainian [[fine art]]. Ranging from [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[icon]]s to portraits of military and church leaders during [[Cossacks|Cossack]] times, some depicting [[caricature]]s of [[Cossack Mamay|Mamay]]. Works include those of [[Taras Shevchenko]], [[Ilya Repin|Ilya Yefimovich Repin]], [[Vladimir Borovikovsky]], [[Vasily Tropinin|Vasily Andreevich Tropinin]], [[Mykola Pymonenko|Mykola Pimonenko]], [[Mikhail Vrubel]], [[Nikolai Ge]], and [[Oleksandr Murashko]].
Today, the museum continues to expand its collection. Some new additions include a unique icon relief of [[Saint George|St. George]] and works by the international Kiev born pioneer of [[Geometric abstraction|Geometric abstract art]] [[Kazimir Malevich]].

The '''[[Golden Gate, Kiev|Golden Gate]]''': is a historic gateway in the ancient city's walls. The name ''Zoloti Vorota'' is also used for a nearby [[theatre]] and a station of the [[Kiev Metro]].
This gateway was one of three constructed by [[Yaroslav I the Wise|Yaroslav the Wise]], Prince of Kiev, in the mid-11th century. It was reputedly modelled on the [[Golden Gate (Constantinople)|Golden Gate]] of [[Constantinople]], from which it took its name. In 1240 it was partially destroyed by [[Batu Khan]]'s [[Golden Horde]]. It remained as a gate to the city (often used for ceremonies) through the 18th century, although it gradually fell into ruins. <!-- [[Saint Sophia's Cathedral, Kiev|Saint Sophia Cathedral]] was built nearby, partially over the ruins (which had been covered with soil). **this needs to be explained: the cathedral is contemporaneous to the gate. --> In 1832 the ruins were excavated and an initial survey for their conservation was undertaken. Further works in the 1970s added an adjacent pavilion, housing a museum of the gate. In the museum one can learn about the history of construction of the Golden gate as well as ancient Kiev. In 1982, the gate was completely reconstructed for the 1500th anniversary of Kiev, although there is no solid evidence as to what the original gates looked like. Some [[History of art|art historians]] called for this reconstruction to be demolished and for the ruins of the original gate to be exposed to public view. In 1989, with the expansion of the [[Kiev Metro]], the [[Zoloti Vorota (Kiev Metro)|Zoloti Vorota]] station was opened nearby to serve the landmark. What makes it unique is that its architectural ensemble is very much based on the internal decorations of [[Architecture of Kievan Rus|ancient Ruthenian churches]].

The small '''[[Ukrainian National Chernobyl Museum]]''' acts as both a memorial and historical center devoted to the events surrounding the 1986 [[Chernobyl disaster]] and its effect on the Ukrainian people, the environment, and subsequent attitudes toward the safety of [[nuclear power]] as a whole.

==History of Kiev's name in English==
[[File:Kiou1562.jpg|thumb|left|A fragment of ''Russiae, Moscoviae et Tartariae'' map by Anthony Jenkinson (London 1562) published by [[Abraham Ortelius|Ortelius]] in 1570.]]

Currently, ''Kiev'' is the traditional and most commonly used [[English language|English]] name for the city,<ref>As of 2008, the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] includes 19 quotations with 'Kiev' and none with any other spelling. This spelling is also given by [[Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica|Britannica]] and [[Columbia Encyclopedia]].</ref> but in 1995 the Ukrainian government adopted ''Kyiv'' as the mandatory [[romanization]] for use in legislative and official acts.<ref>{{cite web|title=Resolution of the ukrainian commission for legal terminology No. 5|url=http://www.uazone.net/Kiev_Kyiv.html|publisher=Ukrainian Commission for Legal Terminology|accessdate=15 March 2011}}</ref>

As a prominent city with a long history, its English name was subject to gradual evolution. The early English spelling was derived from [[Old East Slavic]] form ''Kyjev<U+044A>'' ([[Cyrillic alphabet|Cyrillic]]: <U+041A><U+044A><U+0131><U+0454><U+0432><U+044A><ref>The form "<U+041A><U+044A><U+0131><U+0454><U+0432><U+044A>" (Kyiev) is used in old Rus chronicles like [http://litopys.org.ua/lavrlet/lavr25.htm Lavretian Chronicle] (<U+041C><U+0441><U+0442><U+0438><U+0441><U+043B><U+0430><U+0432><U+044A> <U+041A><U+044A><U+0131><U+0454><U+0432><U+044C><U+0441><U+043A><U+044A><U+0131><U+0438>, Mstislav Kyievski; <U+041A><U+044A><U+0131><U+04D5><U+043D><U+0435>, Kyiene (Kievans)), [http://litopys.org.ua/novglet/novg23.htm Novgorod Chronicles] and others.</ref>), derived from [[Kyi, Schek and Khoryv|Kyi]] (<U+041A><U+0438><U+0439>), the [[Kyi, Schek and Khoryv|legendary founder of the city]].

Early English sources use various names, including ''Kiou'', ''Kiow'', ''Kiew'', ''Kiovia''. On one of the oldest English maps of the region, ''Russiae, Moscoviae et Tartariae'' published by [[Abraham Ortelius|Ortelius]] (London, 1570) the name of the city is spelled ''Kiou''. On the 1650 map by Guillaume de Beauplan, the name of the city is ''Kiiow'', and the region was named ''K<U+00FF>owia''. In the book ''Travels'', by Joseph Marshall (London, 1772), the city is referred to as ''Kiovia''.<ref name=Marshall>{{cite book |last=Marshall |first=Joseph, fl.1770 |title= Travels through Germany, Russia, and Poland in the years 1769 and 1770. |origyear=1772 |year=1971 |publisher=Arno Press |location=New York |language= |isbn=040502763X |oclc= |doi= |id={{LCCN|77||135821}} }} Originally published: London, J. Almon, 1773, {{LCCN|03||005435}}.</ref> While the choice of these spellings have likely been influenced by the [[Polish name]] of the city ({{lang-pl|Kij<U+00F3>w}}) as until mid-seventeenth century the city was controlled by [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|Poland]], the name ''Kiev'' {{IPA|[<U+02C8>kijef]}} that started to take hold at later times, likely originates on the basis of [[Russian language|Russian]] orthography and pronunciation {{IPA|[<U+02C8>kijef]}}, during a time when Kiev was in the [[Russian Empire]] (since 1708 a centre of a [[Governorate]]).

In English, ''Kiev'' was used in print as early as in 1804 in the [[John Cary]]'s "New map of Europe, from the latest authorities" in "Cary's new universal atlas" published in [[London]]. The English travelogue titled ''New Russia: Journey from Riga to the Crimea by way of Kiev'', by Mary Holderness was published in 1823.<ref name=Holderness>{{cite book |last=Holderness |first=Mary |title=Journey from Riga to the Crimea, with some account of the manners and customs of the colonists of new Russia. |year=1823 |publisher=Sherwood, Jones and co. |location=London |oclc=5073195 |doi= |id={{LCCN|04||024846}} |pages=316 }}</ref> By 1883, the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] included ''Kiev'' in a quotation. ''Kiev'' is also based on the old Ukrainian language spelling of the city name and was used by Ukrainians and their ancestors from the time of [[Kievan Rus'|Kievan Rus]] until only about the last century.<ref name=Burst>Edward Burstynsky, former head of the [[Linguistics]] department at the [[University of Toronto]], cited by Andrew Gregorovich in [http://www.infoukes.com/faq/kyiv-2/ Kiev or Kyiv?], ''FORUM Ukrainian Review'', No. 92, Spring 1995</ref>

''Kyiv'' ({{IPA|[<U+02C8>k<U+026A>jiw]}}) is the [[Romanization|romanized]] version of the name of the city used in modern [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]]. Starting from the twentieth century it has been used in English-language publications of the [[Ukrainian diaspora]] and in some academic publications concerning Ukraine. Following the independence in 1991, the Ukrainian government introduced [[Romanization of Ukrainian|the national rules for transliteration of geographic names]] from Ukrainian into English. According to the rules, the Ukrainian <U+041A><U+0438><U+0457><U+0432> transliterates into ''Kyiv''. This has established the use of the spelling ''Kyiv'' in all official documents issued by the governmental authorities since October 1995. The spelling is used by the [[United Nations]], all English-speaking foreign [[diplomatic mission]]s,<ref>Embassies of [http://www.dfat.gov.au/missions/countries/ua.html Australia], [http://www.britishembassy.gov.uk/servlet/Front?pagename=OpenMarket/Xcelerate/ShowPage&c=Page&cid=1087554796297 Great Britain], [http://www.international.gc.ca/canada-europa/ukraine/menu-en.asp Canada], [http://kiev.usembassy.gov/main_eng.html United States]</ref> several international organizations,<ref>The list includes NATO, [http://www.osce.org/regions/13005.html OSCE], [http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/ECAEXT/UKRAINEEXTN/0,,menuPK:328543~pagePK:141132~piPK:141107~theSitePK:328533,00.html World Bank]</ref> [[Encarta|Encarta encyclopedia]], and by some media, notably in [[Canada]] and Ukraine.<ref>''[[Kyiv Post]]'', the leading English language publication in Ukraine.</ref> In October 2006, the United States federal government changed its official spelling of the city name to ''Kyiv'', upon the recommendation of the US Board of Geographic Names.<ref>[http://geography.about.com/b/2006/10/20/us-begins-to-spell-kiev-as-kyiv.htm U.S. Begins to Spell Kiev as Kyiv] About.com Geography, Friday October 20, 2006</ref> The British government has also started using Kyiv.<ref>[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/+/http://www.number10.gov.uk/Page20199 GenocideUKraine - epetition response] The National Archives, The official site of the Prime Minister's Office, Friday 31 July 2009</ref>  The alternate romanizations ''Kyyiv'' (BGN/PCGN transliteration) and ''Kyjiv'' (scholarly) are also in use in English-language atlases. Most major English-language news sources like [[BBC]]<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/talking_point/4946456.stm Q&A: Chernobyl 20 years on] [[BBC News]] 2006/04/26</ref> continue to use ''Kiev''.
