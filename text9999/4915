'''Jacqueline DeLois Moore''' (born [[January 6]], [[1964]] in [[Dallas, Texas]]) is an [[United States|American]] [[actor|actress]] and [[Professional wrestling|professional wrestler]]. She worked for both [[World Championship Wrestling]] and [[World Wrestling Entertainment]], and made history in the latter [[professional wrestling promotion|promotion]] as the first [[African American|Black]] woman to win the [[WWE Cruiserweight Championship]], and as the first African American to win the [[WWE Women's Championship|WWF Women's Championship]]. Since her release from WWE in [[2004]], she has focused on her acting career.

==Wrestling career==
Jacqueline was a professional wrestling fan as a child, and began training under [[Jim Wehba|Skandor Akbar]] after she met him in a [[gym]]. She was the only female in his [[professional wrestling school|school]], preparing her for a career in which she would often wrestle against men. She debuted in [[1989]] in the [[Texas]]-based [[World Class Championship Wrestling]] [[professional wrestling promotion|promotion]] as '''Sweet Georgia Brown'''. 

===United States Wrestling Association===
In [[1992]] Jacqueline moved on to the [[United States Wrestling Association]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], where she was known as '''Miss Texas'''. She became a fixture in the women's division, which she would dominate for four years. She was the first ever USWA Women's Champion, winning the newly created title in a tournament on [[March 2]], 1992. She lost the title to Lauren Davenpot on [[April 13]], and regained the title on [[August 24]]. [[Feud (professional wrestling)|Feuding]] with Davenport, Moondog Fifi and Leslie Belanger, she held the title two more times in 1992 and three times in [[1993]]. Throughout 1993, she wrestled WWF stars [[Sherri Martel|Sensational Sherri]] and [[Gertrude Vachon|Luna Vachon]]. She was out of the title picture for much of [[1994]], only winning the title once, on [[December 5]], but enjoyed four more reigns in [[1995]]. She held the title a thirteenth and fourteenth time in [[1996]] before losing her final USWA Women's Championship to Tasha Simone on [[November 4]], 1996.

===Smoky Mountain Wrestling===
In November [[1995]] Jacqueline made five appearances with [[Smoky Mountain Wrestling]] in [[Kentucky]] and [[Tennessee]] as '''Sgt. Rock'''. She defeated Ron Davis in her debut match, then feuded with The Wolfman throughout the remainder of the month.

===World Championship Wrestling===
Jacqueline began submitting her resume to the [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]]-based [[World Championship Wrestling]], and was eventually contacted by WCW employee [[James J. Dillon|J.J. Dillon]], who offered her a contract. She debuted in WCW in January [[1997]] as the on-screen girfriend of [[Kevin Sullivan (wrestler)|Kevin Sullivan]], then feuding with his estranged wife, [[Nancy Daus|Woman]], and her boyfriend, [[Chris Benoit]]. The two couples fought one another until Benoit defeated Sullivan in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Retirement match|retirement match]]. At [[Road Wild]] on [[August 9]], Jacqueline became the [[Manager (professional wrestling)|valet]] of [[Harlem Heat]]. She later engaged in a brief feud with [[Glenn Gilberti|Disco Inferno]], who she defeated in an upset victory at [[Halloween Havoc#1997|Halloween Havoc 1997]] on [[October 26]]. Her contract was allowed to expire in [[1998]].

===World Wrestling Federation===
====Jacqueline vs. Sable====
Jacqueline joined the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]] in mid-1998. She debuted as the on-screen girlfriend of the [[heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] [[Marc Mero]] and began a feud with [[Rena Mero|Sable]], the estranged wife of Mero. After Jacqueline and Sable traded insults on several occasions, Jacqueline challenged Sable to a [[Bikini contest|bathing suit contest]]. The contest took place on [[July 26]] at [[Fully Loaded]], with Sable winning after she removed her [[Halterneck|halter top]] to reveal a painted on [[bikini]] top. However, the following evening on ''[[WWE RAW|RAW]]'', WWF Chairman [[Vince McMahon]] disqualified Sable as ''"body paint does not constitute a bikini"'', and Jacqueline was awarded the winner's trophy.

Sable recruited [[Gertrude Vachon|Luna Vachon]] and the other [[Oddities]] to fight Jacqueline for her, and helped Luna pin Jacqueline on the [[August 10]] episode of ''RAW''. After the match, Sable gave the unconscious Jacqueline's trophy to Luna. Jacqueline demanded that the trophy be returned, and faced Sable in an [[arm wrestling]] contest on the [[August 17]] episode of ''RAW''. During the contest, Jacqueline broke her grip and pushed the table into Sable's [[solar plexus]], winding her and enabling Jacqueline to retrieve her trophy.

Jacqueline and Mero teamed together to face Sable and a mystery opponent on [[August 30]] at [[SummerSlam (1998)|SummerSlam 1998]]. Sable's partner was revealed to be [[Adam Copeland|Edge]], but he was sidelined for much of the match as Jacqueline dominated Sable, preventing her from tagging out. After Sable finally managed to tag Edge, he delivered the [[Professional wrestling throws#Complete shot|Downward Spiral]] to Mero and then placed Sable atop him, thus winning the match for himself and Sable and humiliating Mero by causing him to lose to his wife. 

After Sable defeated Jacqueline in an [[Professional wrestling match types#Evening gown match|evening gown match]] on the [[September 14]] episode of ''RAW'', Jacqueline demanded a singles bout with Sable. The resultant match was filmed on [[September 15]] in [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]], but broadcast as the [[September 21]] episode of ''RAW''. With the revived [[WWE Women's Championship|WWF Women's Championship]] on the line (the Women's Championship had been abandoned in January [[1996]], two months after [[Debra Miceli|Alundra Blayze]] had left the WWF with the title itself and joined WCW, where she was shown dropping the belt into a [[Dustbin|trash can]]), Jacqueline defeated Sable after Mero tripped Sable and held her foot down, preventing her from kicking out of Jacqueline's [[Professional wrestling holds#Cover|pin]].

Jacqueline and Sable continued to feud, with Jacqueline cutting off Sable's [[ponytail]] on the [[October 5]] episode of ''RAW''. While Jacqueline enjoyed a strong run as champion, squashing challengers such as [[Noreen Greenwald|Starla Saxton]], Mero began to lose more and more frequently. On [[October 26]], Sable challenged Jacqueline to a title match at [[Survivor Series#1998|Survivor Series 1998]]. The title bout took place on [[November 15]] in the [[Scottrade Center|Kiel Center]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]]. With [[Shane McMahon]] acting as referee, Sable defeated Jacqueline to become the new WWF Women's Champion.

====Pretty Mean Sisters====
Jacqueline and Mero separated on the [[November 22]] episode of ''[[WWE HEAT|Sunday Night HEAT]]'', and the jilted Jacqueline formed a [[stable (professional wrestling)|stable]] of  women known as the [[Pretty Mean Sisters]] (or "[[Premenstrual stress syndrome|P.M.S.]]") with [[Terri Runnels]], who was separated from her husband, [[Virgil Runnels III|Goldust]]. During a match between Mero and Goldust on the [[November 23]] episode of RAW, Jacqueline and Terri entered the ring and [[Professional wrestling attacks#Low blow|low-blowed]] both men. 

In January [[1999]], Terri claimed to have suffered a [[miscarriage]] after she was knocked of the ring apron by [[Accie C. Connor|D'Lo Brown]]. The guilty Brown essentially became a servant to P.M.S., who humiliated him and forced him to wrestle his friend, [[Mark Henry]]. The deception lasted until [[February 1]], when the ringside [[Medicine|doctor]] told Brown that Terri had not been [[pregnant]]. P.M.S. then feuded with Brown, costing him matches and attacking his newly debuted manager, [[Lisa Moretti|Ivory]]. Jacqueline returned to the women's division in March 1999, and on the [[April 12]] episode of ''RAW'' she, Ivory, [[Terri Poch|Tori]] and Sable took part in a four way match for the Women's Championship. The match was declared a no-contest after Sable's [[bodyguard]] [[Nicole Bass]] stormed the ring and [[Chokeslam|chokeslammed]] the three challengers. 

P.M.S. gained a "[[Love slave]]", [[Shawn Stasiak|Meat]], in May 1999. In the same month the stable expanded once more to incorporate [[Alicia Webb|Ryan Shamrock]], who had been spurned by the womanizing [[Sean Morley|Val Venis]]. Shamrock left both the stable and the WWF in the following months, while Terri and Jacqueline assisted Meat in his matches. Tension began to grow between the two women as Terri exhausted Meat with hours of [[sex]] before his matches, then berated her fatigued lover when he lacked the energy to win matches, and Jacqueline left the stable after Terri forced Meat to kiss her feet on the [[August 1]] episode of ''Sunday Night HEAT''.

====Solo career====
On the [[September 6]] episode of ''RAW'', Jacqueline faced the [[misogynistic]] [[Jeff Jarrett]] in advance of his [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|WWF Intercontinental Championship]] match with [[Joanie Laurer|Chyna]]. Jarrett [[squash (professional wrestling)|squashed]] Jacqueline, choking her with the ring ropes, forcing her to submit with the [[Professional wrestling holds#Figure four leglock|figure four leglock]] and breaking a [[guitar]] over her head.

Jacqueline soon returned to her pursuit of the Women's Championship, which she failed to win from Ivory in a three way [[Professional wrestling match types#Hardcore Rules Match|hardcore match]] which also included Luna on [[November 18]]. On [[November 25]], Jacqueline defeated Ivory in a "gravy bowl match" to win the Golden Ladle Trophy. At [[WWE Armageddon#1999|Armageddon 1999]] on [[December 12]] she took part in a four way evening gown match for the Women's Championship, but was stripped following a combined assault from her opponents, Ivory, [[Stacy Carter|Miss Kitty]] and [[Cathy Dingman|B.B.]]. On [[January 23]], [[2000]] at the [[Royal Rumble (2000)|Royal Rumble]], Jacqueline entered the "Miss Royal Rumble" swimit contest, which was won by [[Mae Young]]. 

Jacqueline won the WWF Women's Championship for a second time on [[February 1]] in the [[Joe Louis Arena]] in [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]], defeating [[David Lauer|Harvey Whippleman]] (who had won the belt from Miss Kitty while in [[drag (clothing)|drag]] and calling himself "Hervina") in a very short match. Her reign lasted throughout [[February 2000|February]] and [[March 2000|March]], with Jacqueline defeating Ivory and [[Amy Dumas|Lita]] to retain the title, until [[March 30]], when she was challenged by [[Stephanie McMahon-Levesque|Stephanie McMahon]]. The inexperienced Stephanie defeated Jacqueline following extensive interference from [[D-Generation X]].

Jacqueline's requests for a rematch were denied, and she lost a [[battle royal]] for the number one contendership to Lita. On the [[July 2]] episode of ''Sunday Night HEAT'', [[WWE Light Heavyweight Championship|WWF Light Heavyweight Champion]] [[Dean Simon|Dean Malenko]] challenged ''"anyone with enough manhood"'' to face him. After Jacqueline came to the ring, Malenko explained that he had said ''"manhood, not somebody <u>from</u> the hood."'' Jacqueline was granted a title shot, but submitted to Malenko's [[Professional wrestling holds#Texas cloverleaf|Texas cloverleaf]].

Throughout [[August 2000|August]] and [[September 2000|September]], Jacqueline feuded with WWF Women's Champion Lita, aligning herself with [[Edge and Christian]] to counter the presence of Lita's constant companions, [[Hardy Boyz|The Hardy Boyz]]. She received further title shots on [[October 9]] and [[November 2]], but failed to unseat Lita on both occasions.

====The A.P.A.====
The [[Acolyte Protection Agency]] ([[Ron Simmons|Faarooq]] and [[John Layfield|Bradshaw]]) recruited Jacqueline on the [[December 18]] episode of RAW, asking her to take care of [[Trish Stratus]] while they fought Stratus' clients, [[T & A]]. In the resultant six person tag match, Jacqueline pinned Stratus. On the [[December 21]] episode of ''[[WWE Friday Night SmackDown!|SmackDown!]]'', Jacqueline challenged [[Right to Censor]] member Ivory to a title match. After the other members of R.T.C. distracted Jacqueline and enabled Ivory to pin her, the A.P.A. repaid the favor by saving Jacqueline from a group beating after the match.

The feud between the A.P.A. and R.T.C. continued throughout early-[[2001]], and culminated in a match at [[WrestleMania X-Seven]] on [[April 1]] which pitted R.T.C. ([[Barry Buchanan|Bull Buchanan]], [[Charles Wright (wrestler)|The Goodfather]] and Val Venis) against The A.P.A. and [[Peter Senerca|Tazz]]. In the early stages of the match, Jacqueline [[DDT (professional wrestling)|DDT'ed]] [[Michael Manna|Steven Richards]], the leader of R.T.C. who had accompanied them to ringside. R.T.C. lost the match after Bradshaw pinned The Goodfather.

====Tough Enough====
In mid-2001, Jacqueline, along with Tazz, [[Allen Sarven|Al Snow]] and [[Terri Poch|Tori]], became a trainer on the [[MTV]] [[reality television|reality TV]] [[television program|series]] ''[[Tough Enough]]''. 

====The Invasion and its aftermath====
In late-2001, Jacqueline remained loyal to the WWF throughout [[The Invasion (pro wrestling)|The Invasion]], feuding with [[The Alliance|Alliance]] members [[Stacy Keibler]], [[Torrie Wilson]], Ivory and [[Noreen Greenwald|Mighty Molly]]. She took part in the [[Professional wrestling match types#Six pack challenge|six pack challenge]] for the vacant WWF Women's Championship on [[November 18]] at [[Survivor Series#2001|Survivor Series 2001]] which was won by Trish Stratus. Several weeks later, Jacqueline challenged Trish for the title at [[WWE Vengeance#2001|Vengeance 2001]]. Due to Trish's relative inexperience, Jacqueline dominated the match but was surprised by a backslide pin costing herself victory and another championship reign. Jacqueline and Trish did shake hands before and after the match, in a show of good sportsmanship.

====Referee====
In [[2002]], Jacqueline became a referee, with her debut match being a Women's Championship bout between [[Carlene Begnaud|Jazz]] and Trish Stratus at the [[Royal Rumble (2002)|2002 Royal Rumble]]. At [[WrestleMania X8]] she refereed a match pitting [[Curt Hennig|Mr. Perfect]], [[Lance Evers|Lance Storm]] and [[Andrew Martin|Test]] against [[Scott Garland|Scotty 2 Hotty]], [[Matthew Bloom|Albert]] and [[Solofa Fatu|Rikishi]] on the ''Sunday Night HEAT'' pre-show. Jacqueline wrestled infrequently throughout 2002, receiving several title shots, none of which she was successful in. In late 2002 she and Trish Stratus began a feud with [[Lisa Marie Varon|Victoria]] and Jazz, which culminated in a four way match for the title at [[WWE Judgment Day#2003|Judgment Day]] on [[May 18]], [[2003]] which was won by Jazz. She took part in a battle royal for the title on [[June 30]], which was won by the debuting [[Gail Kim]].

====Cruiserweight Champion====
Jacqueline appeared very seldomly throughout late 2003 and early [[2004]], spending some of her time working as a trainer in [[Ohio Valley Wrestling]]. On the [[May 6]], 2004 episode of ''SmackDown!'' in [[Tucson, Arizona]], [[WWE Cruiserweight Championship|WWE Cruiserweight Champion]] [[Chavo Guerrero Jr.|Chavo Guerrero, Jr.]] issued an open challenge for anyone to face him for his title, a challenge which was answered by Jacqueline. Jacqueline defeated Chavo in an upset victory. Jacqueline was defeated by Chavo's father, [[Chavo Guerrero|Chavo Classic]], in a non-title match on the [[May 13]] episode of ''SmackDown!'', and on [[May 16]] at [[WWE Judgment Day#2004|Judgment Day 2004]] she lost the Cruiserweight Championship to Chavo Guerrero, Jr. in a match in which Chavo's arm was tied behind his back.

In [[June 2004]], Jacqueline was released from World Wrestling Entertainment. 

===Total Nonstop Action Wrestling===
Jacqueline appeared at the [[November 7]], 2004, [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] [[pay-per-view]] [[TNA Victory Road#2004|TNA Victory Road 2004]], where she lost to [[Stephanie Finochio|Trinity]]. She made a second appearance with TNA on [[December 5]] at [[TNA Turning Point#2004|TNA Turning Point 2004]], where she refereed a match between [[Pat Kenney]] and [[Marc Mero|Johnny B. Badd]] and [[Joseph Dorgan|Johnny Swinger]] and [[Glenn Gilberti]]. Jacqueline cost Gilberti the match by kicking him in the groin after he shoved her, enabling Badd to hit him with the [[Cutter (professional wrestling)#TKO|TKO]] and pin him. In 2006 Jacqueline wrestled some [[house show (wrestling)|house shows]] for TNA.

===Independent circuit===
On [[June 25]], [[2005]] at the Independent Association of Wrestling event "Clash at the Cove" in [[South Bend, Indiana]], Jacqueline defeated [[Crystal Carmichael]] and [[Vanessa Harding]] in a three way match for the newly created IAW Women's Championship.

==Acting career==

In late-2004, Jacqueline was cast in the [[film|movie]] ''Knight Fever'' as a tough [[detective]] known as "Evil" Venus Jackson.

On January 20, 2006, Jacqueline was interviewed by Prowrestling.com and she said that she really wants to get back in the ring and is hoping to go overseas to be booked in some matches. She also says that she is keeping in shape by training in the ring.

Jacqueline appears in [[Ethan Dettenmaier]]'s [[Sin-Jin Smyth]], scheduled for release in October of [[2006]].  She plays V.M "The Engine" Sexton.
