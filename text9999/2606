The '''Ranger SVG-770''' was an air-cooled inverted Vee aero-engine developed by the '''Ranger Aircraft Engine Division''' of the [[Fairchild (aircraft manufacturer)|Fairchild Engine & Aircraft Corporation]]<ref name="janes">"Janes Fighting Aircraft of World War II" (Random House Group Ltd. 20 Vauxhall Bridge Road, London SW1V 2SA, 1989, ISBN 1-851-70493-0), 318 pp.</ref>.

==Development & Production==
In 1931 the '''V-770''' design was put to paper, based on the Ranger 6-440 series of inline aircooled engines, and test flown in the [[Vought XSO2U-1]] Scout. In 1938 it was tested in the Curtiss [[SO3C Seamew]] and found to be unreliable with a tendency to overheat in low speed flight<ref>"A History of Aircraft Piston Engines" by Herschel Smith, (Sunflower University Press Manhattan, Kansas, 1981, ISBN 0-89745-079-5), 255pp.</ref><ref name="complete">"The Complete Encyclopedia of World Aircraft" [http://images.barnesandnoble.com/images/5490000/5496066.gif cover] Editors: Paul Eden & Soph Moeng, (Amber Books Ltd. Bradley's Close, 74-77 White Lion Street, London, NI 9PF, 2002, ISBN 0-7607-3432-1), 1152 pp.</ref>. By 1941 a more developed '''V-770''' was installed in the [[Fairchild AT-21|Fairchild XAT-14 Gunner]] prototype and found satisfactory for the production [[Fairchild AT-21|Fairchild AT-21 Gunner]] gunnery school aircraft<ref name="ohnine">"United States Military Aircraft Since 1909" by F. G. Swanborough & Peter M. Bowers (Putnam New York, ISBN 085177816X) 1964, 596 pp.</ref>.

Produced from 1941-1945, the '''V-770''' featured a two-piece aluminum alloy crankcase, steel barreled cylinders with integral aluminum alloy fins and aluminum alloy heads. The '''V-770''' was one of very few V-type, in-line, air-cooled engines to reach production. The engine was used in a relatively small number of Army Air Forces aircraft, among them the [[Fairchild AT-21]] twin-engine trainer of which approximately 175 were built.<ref>[http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=853National Museum of the Air Force] accessed June 23, 2007</ref>
