'''Interstate&nbsp;87''' ('''I-87''') is a {{convert|333.49|mi|2|sing=on}} [[Interstate Highway]] located entirely within [[New York State]] in the United States. The highway begins at [[the Bronx]] approaches of the [[Triborough Bridge]] in [[New York City]], from where it runs northward through the [[Hudson Valley]], the [[Capital District]], and the easternmost part of the [[North Country (New York)|North Country]] to the [[Canada<U+2013>United States border|Canadian border]] in the [[Champlain (town), New York|Town of Champlain]]. At its north end, I-87 continues into [[Quebec]] as [[Quebec Autoroute 15|Autoroute&nbsp;15]] (A-15). I-87 connects with several regionally important roads: [[Interstate 95 in New York|I-95]] in New York City; [[New York State Route&nbsp;17]] (NY&nbsp;17; future [[Interstate 86 (east)|I-86]]) near [[Harriman, New York|Harriman]]; [[Interstate 84 in New York|I-84]] near [[Newburgh (city), New York|Newburgh]]; and [[Interstate 90 in New York|I-90]] in [[Albany, New York|Albany]]. The route is the longest [[List of intrastate Interstate Highways|intrastate Interstate Highway]] in the Interstate Highway System.

I-87 was assigned in 1957 as part of the establishment of the Interstate Highway System. The portion of I-87 south of Albany follows freeways that predate the Interstate Highway designation, namely the [[Major Deegan Expressway]] in New York City and the [[New York State Thruway]] from the New York City line to Albany. North of Albany, I-87 follows the '''Adirondack Northway''', a highway built in stages from 1957 to 1967. Early proposals for I-87 called for the route to take a more easterly course through the Hudson Valley between New York City and Newburgh. These plans were scrapped in 1970 when I-87 was realigned onto the Thruway between [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and Newburgh.

==Route description==

===South of Albany===
{{Main|Major Deegan Expressway|New York State Thruway}}
I-87 begins at [[the Bronx]] approach to the [[Triborough Bridge]], where it connects to the [[Bruckner Expressway]] ([[Interstate 278|I-278]]) at a [[directional T interchange]]. The freeway heads north from the junction, following the {{convert|8.4|mi|sing=on}} Major Deegan Expressway as it runs along the eastern bank of the [[Harlem River]]. The route connects to the [[Cross Bronx Expressway]] (I-95 and [[U.S. Route 1 in New York|U.S. Route&nbsp;1]] or US&nbsp;1) before leaving the Harlem River to take a northeasterly course across the northwestern part of the Bronx. I-87 soon enters [[Van Cortlandt Park]], where the highway indirectly connects to the [[Henry Hudson Parkway|Henry Hudson]] and [[Saw Mill River Parkway|Saw Mill River]] parkways by way of the [[Mosholu Parkway]]. The freeway continues across the park to the [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] line, where the Major Deegan Expressway becomes the New York State Thruway, a {{convert|496|mi|0|sing=on}}, state-wide [[toll highway]].<ref name="google">{{google maps |url=http://maps.google.com/maps?saddr=Exit+47&daddr=41.0701565,-73.8878647+to:I-87+N&hl=en&ll=43.028745,-74.300537&spn=6.039047,14.27124&sll=41.042074,-73.87207&sspn=0.389451,0.891953&geocode=FVuWbgIdxB6Y-w%3BFUyucgIdiI-Y-yl__UwQ8erCiTHv-nhwGYKeFg%3BFZrHrgIdDzaf-w&t=h&gl=us&mra=dpe&mrsp=1&sz=11&via=1&z=7 |title=overview map of I-87 |accessdate=December 26, 2012}}</ref>

[[File:NewYorkStateThruway(I-87).jpg|thumb|left|Looking east along I-87 toward the Tappan Zee Bridge from Nordkop Mountain in Suffern]]
Now in Westchester County, I-87 heads north across [[Yonkers, New York|Yonkers]], intersecting the [[Cross County Parkway]] before leaving the city for the central part of the county. It stays on a northward track to [[Elmsford, New York|Elmsford]], where it connects to the Saw Mill River Parkway and merges with the [[Cross-Westchester Expressway]]. [[Interstate 287|I-287]], one of I-87's three spur routes, joins the Thruway here, and I-87 and I-287 proceed west across the [[Hudson River]] on the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]] to enter [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The [[concurrency (road)|concurrent]] Interstate Highways travel west across the county's heavily developed southern towns, meeting the [[Palisades Interstate Parkway]] and the [[Garden State Parkway Connector]] before separating outside of [[Suffern, New York|Suffern]]. I-87 bends northward from here, running along the west edge of [[Harriman State Park (New York)|Harriman State Park]] to the [[Orange County, New York|Orange County]] village of [[Woodbury, Orange County, New York|Woodbury]]. Here, the road connects to [[New York State Route 17|NY&nbsp;17]] and the toll collection along I-87 transitions from barrier-based to ticket-based.<ref name="google" />

The change in the toll collection method leads to a distinct change in the exit layout as the frequent exits of various designs in Westchester and Rockland counties give way to [[trumpet interchange]]s spaced several miles apart across the mostly rural [[Hudson Valley]]. I-87 runs northeast from Woodbury to [[Newburgh (city), New York|Newburgh]], connecting to [[Interstate 84 in New York|I-84]] at exit&nbsp;17 before turning north to cross parts of Orange and [[Ulster County, New York|Ulster]] counties. About {{convert|30|mi}} north of Newburgh, I-87 meets another spur route, the short [[Interstate 587|I-587]], outside of [[Kingston (city), New York|Kingston]]. Over the next {{convert|50|mi}}, the Thruway trends slightly eastward, moving closer to the Hudson River as it traverses mostly open parts of Ulster and [[Greene County, New York|Greene]] counties. In [[Albany County, New York|Albany County]], I-87 intersects the [[Berkshire Connector]] at exit&nbsp;21A, located just west of the riverbank and {{convert|10|mi}} south of [[Albany, New York|Albany]].<ref name="google" />

[[File:I-87 N Exit 21 for NY-23.jpg|thumb|Signage for Thruway exit&nbsp;21 ([[New York State Route 23|NY&nbsp;23]]) in Catskill]]
As the Thruway approaches downtown Albany, it begins to swing to the northwest, bypassing the city. While the Thruway runs along Albany's perimeter, direct access to the city is made via I-87's northernmost spur, [[Interstate 787|I-787]], which forks from its parent at exit&nbsp;23. I-87 runs across the capital city's residential suburbs for {{convert|6|mi}} to exit&nbsp;24, a complex interchange with [[Interstate 90 in New York|I-90]]. At this point, I-87 leaves the Thruway to access the nearby south end of the toll-free Adirondack Northway, also known simply as the Northway, while I-90 merges in from the east to follow the mainline for the rest of its westward course toward [[Pennsylvania]].<ref name="google" />

===Adirondack Northway===
Off the Thruway, I-87 and I-90 overlap for a half-mile along I-90's toll-free path through the Albany area. The brief concurrency ends at exit&nbsp;1 of the Adirondack Northway in [[Guilderland, New York|Guilderland]], a junction also numbered as exit&nbsp;1 on I-90. Here, I-87 turns to head north toward the Canadian border at [[Champlain (town), New York|Champlain]] while I-90 continues east toward downtown Albany and [[Rensselaer County, New York|Rensselaer County]].<ref name="google" /> South of this point, the Northway feeds into a {{convert|0.86|mi|2|sing=on}} expressway spur known locally as Fuller Road Alternate,<ref name="2011tvr">{{cite web |url=https://www.dot.ny.gov/divisions/engineering/technical-services/hds-respository/Traffic%20Volume%20Report%202011.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=December 26, 2012 |title=2011 Traffic Volume Report for New York State |date=September 25, 2012 |pages=142<U+2013>145, 207, 242, 244<U+2013>245, 261, 263 |publisher=[[New York State Department of Transportation]]}}</ref> which links I-87 and I-90 to [[U.S. Route 20 in New York|US&nbsp;20]].<ref name="google" /> Fuller Road Alternate is designated as NY&nbsp;910F, an unsigned [[reference route (New York)|reference route]], by the [[New York State Department of Transportation]] (NYSDOT).<ref name="2011tvr" /> In 2004, NYSDOT ceremonially designated the entire {{convert|176|mi|0|sing=on}} Northway as the Adirondack Veterans Memorial Highway.<ref>{{cite news |title=Northway renamed for veterans |newspaper=[[The Daily Gazette]] |date=November 6, 2004 |location=Schenectady, NY |page=B6}}</ref>

====Albany and Saratoga counties====
I-87 heads northeast from I-90 as a six-lane freeway with three lanes in each direction. It immediately traverses the [[Albany Pine Bush]] Preserve and passes west of [[Rensselaer Lake]] before crossing [[CSX Transportation]]'s [[Hudson Subdivision]] and running parallel to Wolf Road, a business thoroughfare through the [[Colonie (town), New York|town of Colonie]]. Wolf Road itself begins adjacent to exit&nbsp;2, a [[cloverleaf interchange]] with [[New York State Route 5|NY&nbsp;5]] (Central Avenue). Heading northbound, the ramp for exit&nbsp;2E feeds directly into the intersection of NY&nbsp;5 and Wolf Road, located just west of [[Colonie Center]], one of the [[Capital District]]'s largest enclosed shopping malls. I-87 continues to run alongside Wolf Road to exit&nbsp;4, a modified [[diamond interchange]] serving [[County Route 151 (Albany County, New York)|County Route&nbsp;151]] (CR&nbsp;151, named Albany Shaker Road) and [[Albany International Airport]]. Wolf Road ends south of the exit; however, another section begins north of the junction, carrying [[New York State Route 155|NY&nbsp;155]] away from the airport. I-87 and NY&nbsp;155 meet at exit&nbsp;5, with the latter routed along Watervliet Shaker Road.<ref name="google" />

[[File:Thaddeus Kosciusko Bridge Albany Summer.jpg|thumb|left|The Thaddeus Kosciusko Bridge carries I-87 over the Mohawk River.]]
After a brief stretch of housing tracts, I-87 connects to [[New York State Route 2|NY&nbsp;2]] and [[New York State Route 7|NY&nbsp;7]] at exit&nbsp;6, a [[single-point urban interchange]], in a commercialized part of the [[hamlet (New York)|hamlet]] of [[Latham, New York|Latham]]. NY&nbsp;7 joins I-87 here, following the freeway for roughly {{convert|0.8|mi}} to exit&nbsp;7, the west end of a limited-access highway known locally as Alternate Route&nbsp;7. While NY&nbsp;7 heads east toward [[Troy, New York|Troy]], I-87 continues north past gradually less commercialized areas as it approaches the northern county line. The businesses ultimately give way to stretches of homes and subdivisions as the highway crosses into [[Saratoga County, New York|Saratoga County]] by way of the [[Thaddeus Kosciusko Bridge]], [[twin bridges]] spanning the [[Mohawk River]].<ref name="google" /> The northern portion of the Northway through Colonie and Saratoga County is now a heavily-traveled commuter route. Since the highway's construction, Saratoga County has become the fastest growing area of the [[Capital District, New York|Capital District]], and indeed all of upstate New York.<ref>{{cite news |title=Growing predicament |last=Aaron |first=Kenneth |date=October 3, 2004 |newspaper=[[Times Union (Albany)|Times Union]] |location=[[Albany, New York|Albany, NY]]}}</ref>

For its first few miles in Saratoga County, I-87 runs across lightly developed parts of the towns of [[Halfmoon, New York|Halfmoon]] and [[Clifton Park, New York|Clifton Park]]. Near exit&nbsp;9, however, the freeway passes through the commercial center of Clifton Park as it connects to [[New York State Route 146|NY&nbsp;146]]. [[Clifton Park Center]], one of several shopping plazas at the junction, is situated southwest of the exit. Past exit&nbsp;9, the commercial development subsides as I-87 traverses another area dominated by housing tracts. Just north of the exit, the freeway passes a rest area for northbound traffic. The freeway continues on, passing to the west of the centers of [[Round Lake (village), New York|Round Lake]] at exit&nbsp;11 and [[Malta, New York|Malta]] at exit&nbsp;12. After Malta, I-87 turns slightly to the northeast and begins to loosely parallel the northwestern edge of [[Saratoga Lake]] as it crosses [[Kayaderosseras Creek]] and enters [[Saratoga Springs, New York|Saratoga Springs]].<ref name="google" />

As the route comes close to downtown Saratoga Springs, it meets [[New York State Route 9P|NY&nbsp;9P]] at exit&nbsp;14. The junction is adjacent to the regionally popular [[Saratoga Race Course]] and thus receives heavy traffic during the racing season. A southbound-only entrance ramp exists off Nelson Avenue Extension about {{convert|1|mi}} south of exit&nbsp;14, designed to handle traffic exiting the track at [[Saratoga Race Course]] and the [[Saratoga Casino and Raceway]]. The highway continues around the eastern edge of Saratoga Springs to exit&nbsp;15, where the relatively undeveloped areas east of I-87 are briefly replaced by [[Wilton, New York|Wilton]]'s commercial district along [[New York State Route 50|NY&nbsp;50]]. As I-87 continues northeast through Wilton, it heads across significantly less developed areas, with open fields becoming the most common feature along the road. It continues into [[Moreau, New York|Moreau]], connecting to [[U.S. Route 9 in New York|US&nbsp;9]] and serving [[Moreau Lake State Park]] by way of exit&nbsp;17, a [[cloverleaf interchange]], before crossing the Hudson River and entering [[Warren County, New York|Warren County]].<ref name="google" />

====Warren and Essex counties====
[[File:View north along I-87, Adirondack Northway, in Warren County, NY.jpg|thumb|Northbound Northway in Warren County|alt=A view of a divided highway from its righthand roadway, with two lanes separated by a dashed white line. There is almost no other traffic; the surrounding area is wooded with some autumn color visible. Ahead the roadways curves by a hill and disappears.]]
Between the bridge and exit&nbsp;18, I-87 passes two rest areas, one for each direction. The road's northward course through [[Queensbury, New York|Queensbury]] quickly brings it to the outskirts of [[Glens Falls, New York|Glens Falls]], and as such the highway heads across another swath of residential neighborhoods. Exits&nbsp;18 and&nbsp;19 are the main exits for the city, with the latter connecting to [[New York State Route 254|NY&nbsp;254]] near the commercial center of Queensbury. Just east of the exit is [[Aviation Mall]], located on NY&nbsp;254 just west of the route's junction with US&nbsp;9. A northwestern turn in the freeway takes I-87 past the [[Great Escape (amusement park)|Great Escape]] amusement park and [[Six Flags Great Escape Lodge & Indoor Waterpark|lodge]], both of which are accessed from exit&nbsp;20 and [[New York State Route 149|NY&nbsp;149]]. Past exit&nbsp;20, I-87 runs across increasingly remote areas of Queensbury as the road enters [[Adirondack Park]] and heads toward [[Lake George (New York)|Lake George]]. The freeway closely follows US&nbsp;9 northwest to the [[Lake George (village), New York|village of Lake George]], where I-87 meets [[New York State Route 9N|NY&nbsp;9N]] via exits&nbsp;21 and&nbsp;22.<ref name="google" />

North of Lake George, I-87 narrows from six to four lanes as it runs alongside US&nbsp;9 to [[Warrensburg, New York|Warrensburg]], a small hamlet on the [[Schroon River]] served by exit&nbsp;23. While US&nbsp;9 heads northwest into the community, I-87 turns northward to follow the east bank of the Schroon River for {{convert|17|mi}} through a deep, remote valley. The stretch ends at exit&nbsp;27, where I-87 reconnects to US&nbsp;9 at the southern tip of [[Schroon Lake]]. At this point, I-87 makes a slight turn to the northeast to follow US&nbsp;9 as the latter road runs along the western shoreline of Schroon Lake. Both roads pass a handful of lakefront properties on their way into [[Essex County, New York|Essex County]] and the town of [[Schroon, New York|Schroon]], where the lake comes to an end and [[New York State Route 74|NY&nbsp;74]] begins its eastward trek to [[Ticonderoga, New York|Ticonderoga]] at exit&nbsp;28. The Schroon River resumes north of the exit, and I-87 and US&nbsp;9 follow the river and its rural valley to the northeast for {{convert|15|mi}} to the town of [[North Hudson, New York|North Hudson]].<ref name="google" />

In North Hudson, the valley becomes less pronounced as the Schroon River reaches its [[river source|source]] near exit&nbsp;30. Here, US&nbsp;9 and I-87 cross paths again, with the former heading northwest toward [[Keene, New York|Keene]] and the latter continuing northeast in a narrow valley formed by Ash Craft Brook. After {{convert|5|mi}}, the stream reaches its source at Lincoln Pond, leaving the Northway to climb in elevation and wind its way northeastward across the surrounding mountains. It reaches slightly more level ground in [[Westport, New York|Westport]], where I-87 connects to NY&nbsp;9N at exit&nbsp;31. From here, the highway takes a generally northerly track across the [[Bouquet River]] to the town of [[Lewis, Essex County, New York|Lewis]], rejoining US&nbsp;9 as both roads head toward [[Clinton County, New York|Clinton County]]. They split again after {{convert|7|mi}} as US&nbsp;9 veers more easterly than I-87 to serve [[Keeseville, New York|Keeseville]]. The Northway, meanwhile, heads to the northwest, bypassing the village to cross the [[Ausable River (New York)|Ausable River]] and enter Clinton County.<ref name="google" />

====Clinton County====
Just across the county line, I-87 intersects NY&nbsp;9N again at exit&nbsp;34, the southernmost junction to feature [[bilingual]] guide signs in [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]] due to the road's proximity to [[Quebec]]. Past NY&nbsp;9N, the Northway curves to the north, running along the west side of Keeseville before entering another rural but fairly level stretch that follows I-87 out of Adirondack Park. Now outside the park, the highway encounters more frequent pockets of development as it follows [[New York State Route 22|NY&nbsp;22]] into the [[Plattsburgh (town), New York|town of Plattsburgh]]. Just inside the town line, the Northway crosses over the Salmon River and intersects NY&nbsp;22 at exit&nbsp;36, a junction serving nearby [[Plattsburgh International Airport]]. While NY&nbsp;22 heads northeast into the [[Plattsburgh (city), New York|city of Plattsburgh]], I-87 runs north through its western suburbs, passing over the [[Saranac River]] and intersecting [[New York State Route 3|NY&nbsp;3]] at exit&nbsp;37. The Northway and NY&nbsp;22 meet again north of downtown at exit&nbsp;38.<ref name="google" />

[[File:Northway Exit 34 (NY 915F).jpg|thumb|left|Bilingual sign for exit&nbsp;34 (NY&nbsp;9N) in Ausable]]
The section of I-87 between exits&nbsp;38 and&nbsp;39 crosses a marshy area surrounding Dead Creek, a stream feeding into nearby [[Cumberland Bay]]. Access to the bay shore is provided off to the northeast by exit&nbsp;39, a modified cloverleaf interchange for [[New York State Route 314|NY&nbsp;314]]. Continuing away from the junction, I-87 comes within {{convert|1|mi}} of [[Lake Champlain]] as it follows US&nbsp;9 away from Plattsburgh and northward across open, rolling fields in the towns of [[Beekmantown, New York|Beekmantown]] and [[Chazy, New York|Chazy]]. Outside of the hamlet of Chazy, the Northway begins to run across a series of wetlands along the west side of US&nbsp;9. The marshy terrain follows I-87 into the town of Champlain, where I-87 encounters the northernmost community along its course, the [[Champlain (village), New York|village of Champlain]]. I-87 veers slightly westward to avoid the village, and in doing so it meets [[U.S. Route 11 in New York|US&nbsp;11]] at exit&nbsp;42, a diamond interchange just west of the village limits.<ref name="google" />
[[File:I-87 last mile to Canadian border.jpg|right|thumb|Approach to Canadian border|alt=A divided highway going across a level landscape. On the right is a sign in English and French saying "Last U.S. Exit/Derniere Sortie EE. U." On the left the road goes away from the camera, up a slight rise to a more built-up area with a tall antenna.]]
I-87 takes a northerly track from US&nbsp;11, crossing the [[Great Chazy River]] and briefly entering the village limits, where it runs past a series of homes and businesses built up along nearby US&nbsp;9. As both roads head north out of the village, US&nbsp;9 connects to the Northway one last time at exit&nbsp;43, the last interchange on I-87 before the Canadian border. Past the exit, the highway doubles in width, becoming eight lanes wide as it begins to run past the customs facilities on the American side of the border. The Northway and I-87 end shortly thereafter at the Canadian border, where the highway continues past the [[Champlain-St. Bernard de Lacolle Border Crossing]] into Quebec as [[Quebec Autoroute 15|A-15]].<ref name="google" />

==History==

===Designation and early construction===
{{See also|Major Deegan Expressway|New York State Thruway}}
I-87 was assigned on August&nbsp;14, 1957, as part of the establishment of the [[Interstate Highway System]].<ref name="1957map">{{cite map |publisher=[[American Association of State Highway Officials]] |title=[[:File:Interstate Highway plan August 14, 1957.jpg|Official route numbering for the National System of Interstate and Defense Highways]] |date=August 14, 1957}}</ref> The highway initially utilized the pre-existing [[New York State Thruway]] from Albany to Newburgh and in lower [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]], and the [[Major Deegan Expressway]] in New York City. From Newburgh to the Elmsford area, I-87 was to follow [[Hudson River Expressway|a new highway]] running parallel to US&nbsp;9 northward along the eastern bank of the [[Hudson River]] to [[Fishkill, New York|Fishkill]]. I-87 would then have followed the proposed I-84 across the Hudson to rejoin the Thruway outside of Newburgh. Meanwhile, all of the Adirondack Northway, the portion of I-87 slated to extend from Albany north to the Canadian border, had yet to be built.<ref name="1958map">{{cite map |title=New York with Special Maps of Putnam<U+2013>Rockland<U+2013>Westchester Counties and Finger Lakes Region |publisher=[[Esso]] |cartography=[[General Drafting]] |edition=1958 |year=1958}}</ref><ref name="1960map">{{cite map |title=New York and New Jersey Tourgide<!--sic--> Map |publisher=[[Gulf Oil Company]] |cartography=[[Rand McNally and Company]] |year=1960}}</ref> Fuller Road Alternate, the spur leading south from the Adirondack Northway to [[U.S. Route 20 in New York|US&nbsp;20]], was originally intended to be part of the Southern Albany Expressway, a proposed highway which would have connected the Northway with [[Interstate 787|I-787]] and run parallel to the Thruway between exits&nbsp;23 and&nbsp;24.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aaroads.com/northeast/i-787b_ny.html |title=Interstate 787 Southbound |first1=Andy |last1=Field |first2=Alex |last2=Nitzman |work=AARoads |date=September 1, 2009 |accessdate=January 31, 2010}}</ref>

[[File:New York Route 912Q map.png|right|thumb|Map of NY&nbsp;912Q, once part of I-87]]
The Northway was built in segments, which became I-87 as they were completed and linked to the pre-existing route.

===Filling the gaps===
The gap in the Northway between Pottersville and Keeseville was narrowed considerably by July 1967 with the completion of a {{convert|25|mi|sing=on}} segment from Pottersville to exit&nbsp;30 at Underwood. It was closed further on July&nbsp;25, 1967, with the opening of a {{convert|3|mi|sing=on}} stretch near Keeseville between exits&nbsp;34 and&nbsp;33.<ref>{{cite news |title=Governor Opens Link of N'Way at Keesville [sic] |newspaper=Adirondack Life |publisher=Warrensburg<U+2013>Lake George News |date=July 20, 1967 |page=9}}</ref> The last section of the Northway to be built, a {{convert|30|mi|0|sing=on}} stretch between Underwood and Keeseville (exit&nbsp;33), was finished on August&nbsp;31, 1967.<ref name="completion">{{cite news |last=Phillips |first=McCandlish |title=Last Link to Open on the Northway |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0A12F6345E137A93CBAB1783D85F438685F9 |accessdate=December 26, 2012 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=August 29, 1967 |page=39}}</ref> The completion of the Northway linked New York City with Montreal by way of a direct, limited-access highway, with I-87 becoming [[Quebec Autoroute 15|A-15]] at the Canadian border.<ref>{{cite map |title=New York State Highways |publisher=[[State of New York Department of Commerce]] |year=1969 |cartography=Rand McNally and Company}}</ref> The total cost to build the Adirondack Northway was $208&nbsp;million (equivalent to ${{formatprice|{{inflation|US|208000000|1967|r=0}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}).<ref name="inflation-US" /><ref name="completion" />

Another gap in I-87 existed in downstate New York, as the plan to build I-87 along the proposed Hudson River Expressway had been scrapped by 1962. Instead, I-87 was now proposed to begin in [[Port Chester, New York|Port Chester]] and follow a new routing through [[Purchase, New York|Purchase]], [[Armonk, New York|Armonk]], and [[Katonah, New York|Katonah]] to [[Brewster, New York|Brewster]], where it would join I-84.<ref>{{cite map |title=New York and Metropolitan New York |publisher=Sinclair Oil Corporation |year=1962 |cartography=Rand McNally and Company}}</ref> The routing was modified slightly by 1968: I-87 still began in New York City, then [[overlap (road)|overlapped]] with [[Interstate 287|I-287]] east to Purchase. From there, I-87 headed north along the now-open expressway to Armonk, where it ended at [[New York State Route 22|NY&nbsp;22]]. Another portion of the highway, from Goldens Bridge ([[New York State Route 138|NY&nbsp;138]]) to Brewster, was open as well while the part from Armonk to Katonah was under construction.<ref name="1968map">{{cite map |title=New York |publisher=Esso |year=1968 |edition=1969<U+2013>70 |cartography=General Drafting}}</ref> This segment, as well as the part from Katonah to Goldens Bridge, was completed by 1971.<ref>{{cite map |title=New York Thruway |publisher=[[New York State Thruway Authority]] |year=1971 |cartography=Rand McNally and Company}}</ref> On January&nbsp;1, 1970, I-87 was rerouted between Elmsford and Newburgh to follow the mainline of the Thruway instead, leaving the Purchase<U+2013>Brewster freeway to become [[Interstate 684|I-684]].<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.greaternyroads.info/pdfs/state70.pdf |title=Official Description of Touring Routes in New York State |date=January 1, 1970 |author=State of New York Department of Transportation |format=PDF |accessdate=May 13, 2009}}</ref>

===Other developments===
A long stretch of the Northway through the [[Adirondack Park]] had been an unserved zone for [[cellular telephone]] service. In 2007, a driver who crashed off the road was unable to summon help, prompting messages from local governments to telephone companies to add new wireless towers to address the problem and warning signs to inform travelers of the so-called "dark zone".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.wten.com/Global/story.asp?S=7746034 |title=DOT to Erect Signs on N'thway Noting Limited Cell Service |date=January 19, 2008 |work=[[WTEN]] |location=Albany, NY |accessdate=January 31, 2010}}</ref> Throughout this area, roadside emergency call boxes are located approximately every two miles on both sides of the roadway. These boxes use a two-way UHF radio network to connect directly to New York State Police dispatchers. The first of 13 new cellular phone towers along I-87 was installed in October 2008. A second cellular phone tower was completed just one month later.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.pressrepublican.com/archivesearch/local_story_326224629.html |title=Verizon lights up second I-87 cell tower |last=Smith Dedam |first=Kim |date=November 21, 2008 |newspaper=[[Press-Republican]] |location=[[Plattsburgh (city), New York|Plattsburgh, NY]] |accessdate=January 31, 2010}}</ref>

==Future==
