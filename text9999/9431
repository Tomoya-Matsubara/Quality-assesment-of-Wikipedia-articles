'''Seattle Sounders FC'''<!--Per the Sounders organization, the club name is FC not Football Club. Please see talk. Further discussion is always welcomed.-->  is a Major League Soccer (MLS) team based in [[Seattle, Washington]].  It was established in November 2007 as an MLS [[expansion team]]. Fans chose the [[Seattle Sounders|Sounders]] name through an online poll in 2008, making the Seattle Sounders FC the third Seattle soccer team to share the moniker.

The team's majority owner is Hollywood producer [[Joe Roth]] and its minority owners are [[Adrian Hanauer]], [[Paul Allen]], and comedian [[Drew Carey]].  Two-time [[MLS Cup]] winner [[Sigi Schmid]] is the team's head coach.  Sounders FC home matches are played at [[Qwest Field]].  Along with several organized groups, a 53-member marching band called the Sound Wave supports the team at each home game.  Former [[Seattle SuperSonics]] announcer [[Kevin Calabro]] calls the play-by-play for local broadcasts.  Seattle competes with rival clubs for both the [[Heritage Cup (MLS)|Heritage Cup]] and the [[Cascadia Cup]].

Seattle Sounders FC, the league's 15th team, began play in the [[2009 Major League Soccer season|2009]] season.  During their first season, every home game was sold out, a new MLS record for average match attendance was set, and they sold the most season tickets in the league.  The team finished the 2009 season with a winning record and qualified for the [[2009 MLS Cup Playoffs|MLS playoffs]], where they were eliminated in the conference semi-finals.  Sounders FC is the second expansion team in MLS history to win the [[2009 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup|U.S. Open Cup tournament]] in their first season.

In 1996, as [[Seattle Seahawks]] owner [[Paul Allen]] worked with the city to build a new football stadium for his team, the potential of an MLS expansion team that could be a co-tenant helped drive public support for the effort.<ref>{{cite news |first=Elliott |last=Almond |title=Want A Stadium For Football?

By 2000, the MLS was moving away from league-operated teams to investor-operated teams, so wealthy individuals would need to step forward for Seattle to obtain an MLS expansion team.<ref name="2000mls"/>

In 2002, Seattle was again listed as a possibility for an MLS expansion team when the ten-team league announced plans to expand into new markets.<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |title=Garber says MLS plans to add teams |url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20021019&slug=expand19 |newspaper=The Seattle Times |date=October 19, 2002 |accessdate=June 23, 2009}}</ref> In 2004, MLS commissioner [[Don Garber]] indicated that Seattle had been "very close" to receiving the expansion team awarded to [[Real Salt Lake|Salt Lake]]. [[Adrian Hanauer]], then-owner of the United Soccer League's (USL) Sounders (formerly the APSL Sounders), was in discussions with MLS about an estimated payment of $1 million to secure rights to a Seattle franchise for 2006.<ref name="2006mls">{{cite news |first=Jos<U+00E9> Miguel |last=Romero |title=Seattle at "top of list" for MLS team in 2006 |url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20040715&slug=mls15 |newspaper=The Seattle Times |date=July 15, 2004 |accessdate=June 23, 2009}}</ref>  When Seattle was passed over again during the 2006 season (the team went to [[Houston Dynamo|Houston]]), Hanauer announced that he would not be able to secure an expansion team without the help of more investors willing to help cover the increasing MLS franchise fees which had grown beyond $10 million.<ref>{{cite news |first=Matt |last=Massey |title=Seattle's chances for MLS team take a hit |url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20050416&slug=sounders16 |newspaper=The Seattle Times |date=April 16, 2005 |accessdate=June 23, 2009}}</ref>

=== MLS expansion arrives ===
In 2007, Hanauer worked with Hollywood producer [[Joe Roth]] to make another bid for MLS expansion into Seattle at a cost of $30&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite news |first=Ridge |last=Mahoney |title=Sounders bring MLS success in Seattle |url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/soccer/mls/united/2009-07-28-seattle-sounders_N.htm |newspaper=USA Today |date=July 28, 2009 |accessdate=December 5, 2009}}</ref>  Paul Allen, whose First and Goal company operated Qwest Field (formerly Seahawks Stadium), joined the ownership group that same year, making this bid the most promising yet.<ref>{{cite news |first=Craig |last=Smith |title=Gooooal?

The announcement provided a return of [[United States soccer pyramid|top-level]] soccer to Seattle for the first time since the dissolution of its [[Seattle Sounders (NASL)|North American Soccer League (NASL) team]] in 1983.  The announcement also meant that the Seattle Sounders of the USL First Division would play their final season the year before the new MLS franchise was formed.<ref>{{cite news |title=It's official: Seattle to get MLS team in 2009 |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/PrintStory.pl?document_id=2004011415 |newspaper=The Seattle Times |date=November 14, 2007 |accessdate=June 23, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Laurence |last=Moroney |title=MLS announces expansion in Seattle |date=November 13, 2007 |url=http://web.mlsnet.com/news/mls_news.jsp?ymd=20071113&content_id=129230&vkey=news_mls&fext=.jsp |publisher=Major League Soccer |accessdate=November 20, 2007}}</ref>

"Seattle Sounders FC" was announced as the team name on April 7, 2008, along with the team logo, colors, and badge design, in a presentation held at the [[Space Needle]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Matthew |last= Gaschk |title=Sounders FC by fans' acclamation |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/soccer/358051_sounders08.html |newspaper=Seattle Post-Intelligencer |date=April 7, 2008 |accessdate=July 19, 2009}}</ref> The badge design resembles a [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|heraldic shield]] and consists of two layers which represent "the partnership between the ownership, the community, the players and the fans".<ref name="badge"/> The logo incorporates the Space Needle, an internationally recognized Seattle landmark. The official team colors are Sounder Blue, signifying the waters of the [[Puget Sound]]; Rave Green, representing the forests of the [[Pacific Northwest]]; and Cascade Shale, representing the [[Cascade Range]] to the east of Seattle.<ref name="badge">{{cite press release |title=Badge and Colors Fact Sheet |date=April 7, 2008 |url=http://www.soundersfc.com/News/Articles/2008/04-April/Badge-and-Colors-Fact-Sheet.aspx#comments |publisher=Seattle Sounders FC |accessdate=April 7, 2008}}</ref>

Fans chose a name for the team in an online poll held between March 27 and March 31, 2008. The initial list of possibilities<U+2014>Seattle FC, Seattle Republic and Seattle Alliance<U+2014>deliberately did not include Seattle Sounders in order to provide a "fresh start."

The Sounders FC Alliance was established at the request of minority owner [[Drew Carey]].  Based on the fan association at FC Barcelona, members of the Alliance have the ability to vote on the removal of the General Manager and on other team decisions.  Season ticket holders become automatic members while non-season ticket holders may buy into the Alliance for a fee.  Membership benefits include voting privileges, invitation to an annual meeting and other team perks. Members can also be elected to the Sounders FC Alliance Council by receiving at least 25 nominations from other members annually.  The first vote on the General Manager is scheduled to be held in November of 2012 following Seattle's third season.<ref>{{cite news |first=Jos<U+00E9> Miguel |last=Romero |title=Sounders FC announce fan association |date=May 17, 2008 |newspaper=The Seattle Times |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/sounders/2004420604_sounders17.html |accessdate=May 18, 2008}}</ref>  Drew Carey is the chairman of the Sounders FC Alliance.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/soccer/363518_sounders17.html |title=Sounders FC owner caters to fans |last=Gaschk |first=Matthew |newspaper=Seattle Post-Intelligencer |date=May 16, 2008 |accessdate=May 19, 2008}}</ref>
