In his latest work, ''[[The Town (2010 film)|The Town]]'', Affleck once again puts his acting, writing and directorial skills to work, in a stinging portrait of a [[New England]] town and the grip it has on generation after generation, who find it impossible to leave. For his ability to <U+201C>do it all<U+201D> and constantly evolve as an artist, The Palm Springs International Film Festival is proud to present Ben Affleck with the 2011 Chairman<U+2019>s Award.<U+201D> <ref>[http://www.psfilmfest.org/news/detail.aspx?NID=285&year=2010 Ben Affleck and Danny Boyle to be honored at PSIFF Awards Gala &#124; News]</ref>}}

Affleck will star in an upcoming romantic drama written and directed by [[Terrence Malick]], alongside [[Olga Kurylenko]], [[Javier Bardem]], [[Rachel McAdams]] and [[Rachel Weisz]]. Filming took place in fall 2010 in [[Bartlesville, Oklahoma]] and [[Pawhuska, Oklahoma]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/scene/article.aspx?subjectid=268&articleid=20101005_268_0_BARTLE615180 |title=''Tulsa World'' article, Oct. 5, 2010 |publisher=Tulsaworld.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-02}}</ref>

Affleck will also be directing his third feature, ''[[Argo (2012 film)|Argo]]'', for producers [[George Clooney]] and [[Grant Heslov]]. The film tells the story of a CIA operation to save six ambassadors during the 1979 [[Iran hostage crisis]] by faking a production for a large-scale science fiction film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/ben-affleck-george-clooney-argo/ |title=Ben Affleck Negotiating to Direct Unusual Thriller 'Argo' for Producer George Clooney |publisher=Slashfilm.com |date=February 5, 2011 |accessdate=2011-04-19}}</ref>

==Activities==
===Charitable and humanitarian projects===
Like Matt Damon, Affleck is a philanthropist.Affleck's support of the [[non-profit]] charitable organization, the A-T Children's Project,<ref name="organization">{{Cite document |url=http://www.communityatcp.org/NETCOMMUNITY/Document.Doc?&id=118 |publisher=AT Children's Project |title=Update |month=September |year=2001 |accessdate=2007-09-22 |postscript=}}</ref> began while he was filming ''Forces of Nature''.<ref name="People - Bio"/><ref name="People 2"/> Affleck met a then nine-year-old child, Joe Kindregan, who has the rare disease [[ataxia-telangiectasia]] (A-T).<ref name="People - Bio"/><ref name="People 2"/> The disease, described as like having [[muscular dystrophy]], [[cystic fibrosis]], [[immune deficiency]] and [[cancer]] all at once, is progressive; children with A-T usually do not live beyond their late teens.<ref name="People - Bio"/><ref name="People 2"/> Affleck attends benefits and spoke to Congress to advocate for the charity,<ref name="People - Bio"/><ref name="People 2"/> and in 2007 was the keynote speaker at the graduation ceremony of Falls Church High School in Fairfax, Virginia, from which Kindregan was graduating.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/06/01/arts/NA-A-E-CEL-US-Ben-Affleck-Graduation.php |title=Ben Affleck pays tribute to teen friend at high school graduation |accessdate=2008-06-10 |date=2007-06-01 |work=[[International Herald Tribune]]}}</ref>

In June 2008, he appeared in an [[ABC News]] exclusive report exploring the humanitarian crisis in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Eastern Congo]]. Affleck travelled to the African nation and interviewed refugees, warlords, and members of parliament. "I think the more painful something is, the more you want to distance yourself from it," he said. "I think the hard part is actually to let some of that go and to realize that when you see some of these images of people suffering in some way or another, to kind of remember that these are people who are in fact just in different circumstances than you are, but that are kind of dealing with [those circumstances] in a pretty brave and enduring way."<ref>{{cite web |first=Katie |last=Escherich |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/Story?id=5214496&page=1 |title=Ben Affleck's Journey Through the Congo |accessdate=2008-06-30 |date=2008-06-23|work=ABC News}}</ref> In December 2008, he teamed up with the United Nations releasing a short film highlighting the plight of Congolese refugees,<ref>{{cite news | first=Maha | last=Saad | coauthors= Margaret Besheer |authorlink= | title=Ben Affleck, UN Team Up to Raise DRC Refugee Awareness | date=2008-12-17 | publisher= | url =http://www.voanews.com/english/2008-12-17-voa97.cfm | work =Voice Of America | pages = | accessdate = 2008-12-22 | language = }}</ref> and in March 2010, Affleck announced the formation of the [[Eastern Congo Initiative]], which he founded as "the first U.S. based advocacy and grant-making initiative wholly focused on working with and for the people of eastern Congo."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/africa/03/22/congo.affleck/index.html |title=Ben Affleck Launches Aid Group for Eastern Congo |publisher=CNN |accessdate=2010-08-31 | date=2010-03-23}}</ref>

===Political activism===
In the final weeks of the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 Presidential campaign]], Affleck promoted the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] ticket, supporting [[Al Gore]] and repeatedly delivering a get-out-the-vote plea: "It's very important to vote. The president will appoint three or four [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] justices."<ref name="2000 election">{{cite web |first=Roger |last=Simon |url=http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/001120/archive_009683_2.htm |title=A Long, Strange Journey |accessdate=2008-06-09 |date=2000-11-12 |work=[[US News]]}}</ref> During the final week of the race, Affleck <U+2013> along with [[Helen Hunt]], [[Martin Sheen]], [[Rob Reiner]] and other actors <U+2013> spent an hour at a phone bank calling registered Democrats.<ref>{{cite web |first=Monique |last=Simpson |url=http://dailybruin.ucla.edu/stories/2000/nov/1/gore-rallies-supporters-in-wes/ |title=Gore rallies supporters in Westwood |accessdate=2008-06-09 |date=2000-11-01 |work=The Daily Bruin}}</ref> "People in my generation have a low voter turnout.

"But I'm going to tell people to vote for Gore."<ref name="2000 election"/>

On October 28, 2000, Affleck flew with [[Hillary Clinton]], who was running for a [[United States Senate|Senate]] seat, to [[Ithaca]], New York, where he introduced her at a [[Cornell University]] rally. He told the college crowd that Clinton had been advocating for women and working families since "[[Rick Lazio]] was running around the frat house in his underwear". Lazio, then a [[Long Island]] congressman, was Clinton's [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] opponent.<ref>{{cite web |first=J.D. |last=Heyman |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/benaffleck/articles/story/5931795/the_bachelor |title=The Bachelor: Ben Affleck |accessdate=2008-06-09 |date=2001-06-15 |work=[[Rolling Stone]]}} {{dead link|date=February 2011}}</ref>
[[File:AffleckAndRachelMaddow09.jpg|thumb|left|Affleck on the set of ''[[The Rachel Maddow Show (TV series)|The Rachel Maddow Show]]'', April 16, 2009]]
On November 6, 2000, the final day of the campaign, he was one of several high-profile celebrities summoned to [[Miami Beach, Florida|Miami Beach]] by [[Miramax]] Films boss [[Harvey Weinstein]] for a late-night Gore rally, just hours before polls opened nationwide.<ref name="2000 election"/> The Gore campaign's last event, a final effort to energize [[South Beach]] voters, did not end until about 1:00&nbsp;a.m., but Affleck flew back to New York that morning and made a surprise live appearance on ''[[The Rosie O'Donnell Show]]''. It was 10:15&nbsp;a.m. when he made his final public pitch from a [[Rockefeller Center]] studio, noting that he was "a little bit tired&nbsp;... I've been out getting involved, doing stuff and trying to get people to vote. And that's why I came by here". Also, "Today is the get-out-the-vote day and&nbsp;... I think this is the time to get involved, especially the young folks who are here&nbsp;... I'm about to go vote," He then said, "I am personally gonna vote for Al Gore".<ref name="2000 election"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/news/ni0073253/ |title=Actor Didn't Get Out To Vote, Says Web Site |accessdate=2008-06-09 |date=2001-05-01 |publisher=IMDB.com Studio Briefing}}</ref>

As votes were tallied that night, Affleck told [[Salon.com]]'s Amy Reiter, "I'm nervous this evening, but one of the things that's exciting to me is the number of people who voted. No matter who wins, I think it's a healthy thing for our country that so many voters have come out and participated in the process. Either way, I think the most important number will be the turnout".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.salon.com/politics/feature/2000/11/08/reacts_ny/|title=Ben Affleck: "I hope Nader can still sleep"|last=Reiter|first=Amy|date=2000-11-08|publisher=[[Salon.com]]|accessdate=2009-09-01}}</ref>

In the May 2001 issue of ''[[GQ]]'', Affleck said, "My fantasy is that someday I'm independently wealthy enough that I'm not beholden to anybody, so I can run for Congress on the grounds that everyday people should be in government".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/news/ni0065169/ |title=Ben Affleck Wants Political Post |accessdate=2008-06-09 |date=2001-04-16 |publisher=IMDB.com |work=Wenn.com}}</ref> However, when he was asked about his political ambitions in an April 2009 interview to promote the 2009 film, ''[[State of Play (film)|State of Play]]'', Affleck said, "I really like my job that I have now. Plus, unlike in Hollywood where you need one director to hire you, in politics you have to have a lot of people to vote for you. I think it's harder work. I really am happy with what I'm doing now. In fact I've never been at a place where I've felt better about going to work everyday. I'm more engaged and very, very happy."<ref>{{cite web

Affleck supports legalizing [[gay marriage]], saying in 2004, "I don't think the government should be involved in any way in people's bedrooms or lives.

Despite his opposition to [[George W.
