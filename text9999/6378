'''Mart<U+00ED>n Buzzi''' (born March 6, 1967) is an Argentine political scientist and politician elected Governor of [[Chubut Province]] in 2011.

==Life and times==
Mart<U+00ED>n Buzzi was born in [[Comodoro Rivadavia]] in 1967. A third-generation [[Chubut Province]] native, he entolled at the [[National University of Patagonia San Juan Bosco]] and earned a [[PhD]] in [[political science]].<ref name=buzzi2011>{{citeweb|url=http://www.buzzigobernador.com/buzzi.asp|title=Mart<U+00ED>n Buzzi|publisher=Buzzi gobernador 2011}}{{es}}</ref> Following graduation, he joined the Institute of Public Policy at the National Academy of Sciences in 1991, and served as an adviser to a local oil industry executive, Crist<U+00F3>bal L<U+00F3>pez.<ref name=p12>{{citeweb|url=http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/elpais/subnotas/1-52635-2011-03-21.html|title=Un comod<U+00ED>n acad<U+00E9>mico|publisher=''P<U+00E1>gina/12''}}{{es}}</ref> He and his wife, Carolina, have two sons.<ref name=buzzi2011/>

He published his first textbook, ''On the Theory of Regions in Argentina'', in 1993, and in 1994, entered public service as Director of Planning for his native Comodoro Rivadavia. Buzzi authored a textbook on the study of German social scientist [[Max Weber]] in 1994, and was named Professor of Political Science at his alma mater between 1995 and 2003. He served in a number of local business [[advocacy group]]s, and became Vice President of the Institute for the Regional Development of [[Patagonia]]. A term as Director of the Municipal Employment and Production Bureau was followed in December 2003 by his appointment as Provincial Minister of Production by the newly-elected Governor, [[Mario Das Neves]]; Das Neves appointed him Minister of Foreign Trade, Tourism, and Investment in February 2007.<ref name=buzzi2011/> 

He resigned in July, and ran successfully for the post of Mayor of Comodoro Rivadavia on the [[Justicialist Party]] ticket. Buzzi maintained a low profile as mayor, during which tenure he also avoided aligning himself too visibly with any one faction of the traditionally fractious [[Peronist]] movement. He thus earned the governor's trust, and in 2011, was nominated as his party's candidate for Governor to succeed Das Neves.<ref name=p12/> 

The race attracted three strong candidates: [[Puerto Madryn]] Mayor Carlos Eliceche ([[Front for Victory]]), [[Rada Tilly]] Mayor Pedro Peralta ([[Radical Civic Union]]), and Buzzi; another city mayor, Gustavo MacCarthy of [[Trelew]], was nominated as Buzzi's running-mate. The [[Argentine provincial elections, 2011#March 20|elections]], held on March 20, yielded inconclusive results, however, as Buzzi's total of 37.8% (against Eliceche's 37.2%), and his winning margin of 1,551 votes led to a [[recount]] when irregularities triggered a judicial [[injunction]] against results in six precincts totaling 1,967 votes.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.clarin.com/politica/Termino-eleccion-Chubut-candidatos-adjudican_0_447555496.html|title=Chubut: gana el Peronismo Federal pero el kirchnerismo no acepta la derrota|publisher=''Clar<U+00ED>n''}}{{es}}</ref> A protracted recount process followed, as well a court-ordered re-vote held on May 29 in the six impugned precincts. Buzzi, albeit with a narrowed lead of 384 votes, was officially elected Governor of Chubut.<ref name>{{citeweb|url=http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/elpais/1-169123-2011-05-30.html|title=Y 69 d<U+00ED>as m<U+00E1>s tarde se eligi<U+00F3> gobernador|publisher=''P<U+00E1>gina/12''}}{{es}}</ref>
