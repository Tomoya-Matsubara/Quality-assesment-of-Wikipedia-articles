The '''Sussex Spaniel''' is a [[Dog breed|breed]] of [[dog]] developed in [[Sussex]] in southern [[England]]. It is a low, compact [[spaniel]] and is similar in appearance to the [[Clumber Spaniel]]. They can be slow paced, but can have a clownish and energetic temperament. They suffer from health conditions common to spaniels and some large dogs, as well as a specific range of heart conditions and [[spinal disc herniation]].

First bred in 1795 in [[Hastings]], [[East Sussex]] for specific hunting conditions, they nearly became extinct during the [[Second World War]]. They are now more popular in the [[United States]] than any other country and are recognised by all major kennel clubs. Notably, a Sussex Spaniel won the best in show in 2009 at the 133rd [[Westminster Kennel Club]].

==Description==

The Sussex Spaniel is a low compact spaniel similar in appearance to a small, dark [[Clumber Spaniel]]. It is normally no taller than {{convert|13|-|15|in|cm|abbr=on}} at the [[withers]] and the usual weight range is between {{convert|35|-|45|lb|kg|abbr=on}} with a roughly rectangular appearance.<ref name="north">{{cite book |title=The Encyclopedia of North American Sporting Dogs: Written by Sportsmen for Sportsmen |last=Smith |first=Steve |authorlink= |page=136 |year=2002 |publisher=Willow Creek Press |location= |isbn=978-1572235014 |url= |accessdate=2009-11-21}}</ref> The Clumber Spaniel meanwhile is normally between {{convert|17|-|20|in|cm|abbr=on}} high at the shoulder, and weighing {{convert|55|-|85|lb|kg|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Encyclopedia of North American Sporting Dogs: Written by Sportsmen for Sportsmen |last=Smith |first=Steve |authorlink= |page=128 |year=2002 |publisher=Willow Creek Press |location= |isbn=978-1572235014 |url= |accessdate=2009-11-23}}</ref>

One of the noticeable features is their golden liver-coloured coat which is unique to the breed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.raritiesinc.ca/breeds/breed%20standards/Sussex%20Spaniel.pdf |title=Sussex Spaniel: AKC Breed Standard |author= |date= |work= |publisher=raritiesinc.ca |accessdate=2009-11-21}}</ref> Historically however, there has also been examples of both black and sandy coloured Sussex Spaniels.<ref>{{cite book |title=A History And Discription Of The Modern Dogs (Sporting Division) Of Great Britain And Ireland |last=Lee|first=Rawdon B.|authorlink= |pages=453-459 |year=2008 |publisher=Buchanan Press |location= |isbn=978-1443750455 |url= |accessdate=2009-11-23}}</ref> The coat is thick (sometimes with a slight wave to it), feathering on the chest, legs and ears<ref name="north"/> and consists of a weather resistant undercoat with a silky outer coat.<ref name="justdog">{{cite web |url=http://www.justdogbreeds.com/sussex-spaniel.html |title=Sussex Spaniel Information |author= |date= |work= |publisher=JustDogBreeds.com |accessdate=2009-11-21}}</ref> The eyes are hazel in colour. The silky ears are lobe-shaped typical of the Spaniel, and set moderately low.<ref name="akc"/><ref name="justdog"/>

==Temperament==
The Sussex Spaniel is a slow paced, calm breed with somewhat clownish behaviour that normally keeps his energy and enthusiasm in check.  He is always eager to be around people, is excellent around children, and can be quite protective of the family. They make excellent candidates for [[therapy dog]] work.  Most Sussex Spaniels are primarily family pets, but they are competent enough to aid a hunter though quite stubborn to train. They tend to have a natural ability to quarter in the field, have excellent noses, and can be used to retrieve, given training. The breed is the only [[spaniel]] to howl once a game's scent is picked up.<ref name="north"/>

==Health==
The breed is generally healthy with an average life span of 11<U+2013>12 years.<ref name="justdog"/> [[Hip dysplasia]], a genetic malformation of the hip joint, may be a concern but because of the breed's compact nature is not often seriously debilitating.<ref name="health"/><ref>{{cite web |last=Weston|first=Lee|url=http://www.barkbytes.com/bremed/cocker.htm |title=Medical Conditions Associated with the American Cocker Spaniel |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Bark Bytes |accessdate=2009-11-23}}</ref> 

Another common condition is [[otitis externa]], which is common to a variety of spaniels, including the [[Cocker Spaniel]] as the long floppy ears trap moisture, making them prone to recurrent infections rather than dogs with more upright ears. This is the term for outer ear infections, which can be caused by a variety of reasons including mites, ear fungi and generally dirt and germs. Treatment is relatively simple and can range from prescribed antibiotics to over-the-counter ear cleaning liquids.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.petsdoc.com/html/askthevet/askthevetquestions/allergicotitis.html |title=Allergic Otitis-Ear Infections  |author= |date= |work=Petsdoc.com |publisher= |accessdate=2009-11-23}}</ref>

[[Birth|Whelping]] sometimes presents difficulties and require [[caesarean section]] for successful delivery of the puppies.<ref name="health"/>

===Heart conditions===
[[image:108. Sussex Spaniel.JPG|thumb|right|Alt=Two dark colored spaniels stand facing to the right|A drawing of two Sussex Spaniels from 1859]]
Heart conditions in the Sussex Spaniel can include [[pulmonary valve stenosis]], which is the most common of the congenital heart defects. Essentially, in an animal with this condition, the [[pulmonary valve]] is improperly formed which causes the heart to work much faster to pump blood around the body. The final results of this condition can be swelling of fluid in the chambers of the heart, thickening of the heart muscle known as [[ventricular hypertrophy]] leading to eventual heart failure.<ref name="health">{{cite web |url=http://www.petinsurance.com/healthzone/pet-articles/pet-breeds/Sussex-Spaniels.aspx |title=Sussex Spaniels: A Winning Breed in More Ways Than One |author= |date= |work= |publisher=VPI Pet HealthZone |accessdate=2009-11-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.terrificpets.com/articles/102124365.asp |title=Pulmonic Stenosis: The Most Common Congenital Heart Defect |author= |date= |work= |publisher=TerrificPets.com |accessdate=2009-11-23}}</ref>

[[Patent ductus arteriosus]] also appears in the breed.<ref name="health"/> It is a condition where a small blood vessel connecting two major arteries does not close following birth. It can cause complications as it is positioned to allow the blood flow to bypass the lungs. It also appears in [[American Staffordshire Terrier]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.terrificpets.com/articles/102171565.asp |title=The American Staffordshire Terrier and Congenital Heart Disease |author= |date= |work= |publisher=TerrificPets.com |accessdate=2009-11-23}}</ref>

A heart condition uncommon to the breed is [[tetralogy of Fallot]], which is more common in the [[Keeshond]] and [[English Bulldog]] breeds relatively. It is actually a combination of up to four conditions, including the previously mentioned pulmonary valve stenosis, with a secondary condition of [[right ventricular hypertrophy]]. The other conditions are [[ventricular septal defect]] which is a defect or hole in the wall of the heart between the two [[Ventricle (heart)|ventricles]] and the aorta which carries the blood from the left to the right side of the heart can be mis-positioned. The effect on the dog depends on the severity of the condition, and can range from a [[heart murmur]] through to reduced activity levels to death. Symptoms in puppies are generally a failure to grow and a reduced tolerance for exercise. Active treatment is effective in around 50% of cases.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.upei.ca/~cidd/Diseases/cardiovascular%20diseases/tetralogyoffallot.htm |title=What is Tetralogy of Fallot? |author= |date=2001-10-30 |work=Canine Inherited Disorders Database |publisher= |accessdate=2009-11-23}}</ref><ref name="health"/>

===Intervertebral disc syndrome===
Also commonly called [[spinal disc herniation]], this is where the [[Intervertebral disc]] bulges or ruptures into the [[vertebral canal]] where the [[spinal cord]] resides. When the cord is compressed, the dog can experience symptoms ranging in scope from mild back or neck pain to paralysis of limbs, loss of sensation, and loss of [[bladder]] or [[bowel]] control. It is most commonly seen in the mid-back area, but can occur anywhere along the spine. Mild cases that do not result in paralysis can be treated medically by confining the animal in a crate to restrict movement to a minimum for several weeks, which can be accompanied by pain medication. Surgery can restore sensation to a dog's legs following paralysis but the success rate depends on how severe the herniation was.<ref>{{cite web |last=Lundgren|first=Becky|url=http://www.veterinarypartner.com/Content.plx?P=A&A=2373 |title=Intervertebral Disk Disease (Herniations of the Disk)  |author= |date= |work= |publisher=VeterinaryPartner.com |accessdate=2009-11-21}}</ref><ref name="health"/>

==History==
[[File:Sussex Spaniel from 1915.JPG|thumb|Alt=A black and white photo of a dark low dog facing the camera sideways on.|Sussex Spaniel circa 1915]]
In 1795, Mr. Fuller of Rosehill Park, [[Hastings]] in [[East Sussex]], [[England]] began breeding [[gun dog]]s to work in districts where the terrain was rough and the undergrowth very dense which meant that a spaniel was needed which could give tongue or to alert the hunter on his quarry. Fuller crossed  various breeds such as the liver and white [[Norfolk Spaniel]] (now extinct), the [[Field Spaniel]], and possibly some early [[Springer Spaniel]]s. The Sussex was bred specifically to inherit the barking ability that was not common in most Spaniel breeds during this era.<ref name="sarah">{{cite web |url=http://www.sarahsdogs.com/breeds/sussex_spaniel/ |title=Sussex Spaniel Information |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Sarah's Dogs |accessdate=2009-11-23}}</ref>

The Sussex Spaniel was one of the first ten breeds admitted into the stud book by the [[American Kennel Club]] in 1884,<ref name="akc">{{cite web |url=http://www.akc.org/breeds/sussex_spaniel/ |title=AKC Meet the Breeds: Sussex Spaniel |author= |date=1992-04-07 |work= |publisher=American Kennel Club |accessdate=2009-11-21}}</ref> but lost what little popularity it had achieved in the 1940s. During [[World War II]], breeding was discouraged but  the Sussex saved from extinction by English breeder [[Joy Freer]]. All modern Sussex Spaniels are descended from the dogs she saved.<ref name="history">{{cite web |url=http://www.sussexspaniels.org.uk/the_sussex/history.html |title=The History of The Sussex Spaniel |author= |date= |work=Sussex Spaniel Association |publisher= |accessdate=2009-11-23}}</ref> In 1947, only 10 Sussex Spaniels were registered in the English [[The Kennel Club|Kennel Club]].<ref name="sarah"/>

In 2004 the breed was identified as a [[Vulnerable Native Breeds|Vulnerable Native Breed]] by [[The Kennel Club|Kennel Club of Great Britain]] which are described as having annual registration figures of less than 300 per year. In 2008, only 56 puppies were registered.<ref name="history"/>

In 2009 a Sussex Spaniel named "[[Clussexx Three D Grinchy Glee]]," call name "Stump," won best in show at the 133rd [[Westminster Kennel Club]] Dog Show. At 10 years old, Stump is the oldest dog to win this title.<ref>{{cite news | last =Johnston | first =Lauren | title = 10 fun facts about the Westminster dog show's 2009 winner: Stump the 10-year-old Sussex Spaniel | work =[[New York Daily News]] | date =February 11, 2009 | url =http://www.nydailynews.com/lifestyle/2009/02/11/2009-02-11_10_fun_facts_about_the_westminster_dog_s.html | accessdate = 2009-11-23 }}</ref>

The breed is more popular in the [[United States]] than any other country.<ref name="sarah"/> It is recognised by the [[Continental Kennel Club]], [[F<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ration Cynologique Internationale]], [[American Kennel Club]], Kennel Club of Great Britain, [[Canadian Kennel Club]], [[National Kennel Club]], [[New Zealand Kennel Club]], and the [[American Canine Registry]].<ref name="sarah"/>
