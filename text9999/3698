Home of the [[United Nations]], the city is a hub for international diplomacy. The current [[Mayor of New York City|mayor]] is [[Michael Bloomberg]], who assumed office after [[Rudolph W. Giuliani]] on [[January 1]], [[2002]].

New York City comprises five [[borough]]s, each of which are coterminous with a county: [[The Bronx]], [[Brooklyn]], [[Manhattan]], [[Queens]], and [[Staten Island]]. With over 8.2 million residents within an area of 322 square miles (830&nbsp;km<U+00B2>), New York City has the highest population density of any major North American city.<ref name="NYC land area">{{cite web| title=Land Use Facts |url=http://home2.nyc.gov/html/dcp/html/landusefacts/landusefactshome.shtml|publisher=New York City Department of City Planning| accessdate=2007-03-13}} New York City's total area is 468.9&nbsp;mi<U+00B2>. 159.88&nbsp;mi<U+00B2> of this is water and 321&nbsp;mi<U+00B2> is land.</ref><ref name="census">{{cite web |publisher=New York City Department of City Planning |title=The Current Population of NYC (2005) |url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/pdf/census/detailed_narrative_2005.pdf| format=PDF| accessdate=2007-03-13}} These figures were adopted by the U.S. Census Bureau in September 2006.</ref> The [[New York metropolitan area]], with a population of 18.8 million, ranks among the [[List of metropolitan areas by population|largest urban areas]] in the world.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |title=Annual Estimates of the Population of Metropolitan and Micropolitan Statistical Areas: April 1, 2000 to July 1, 2006 |url=http://www.census.gov/population/www/estimates/metro_general/2006/CBSA-EST2006-01.csv |accessdate=2007-04-11}}</ref> 

The city has many neighborhoods and landmarks known around the world. The [[Statue of Liberty]] greeted millions of immigrants as they came to America in the late [[19th century|19th]] and early [[20th century|20th]] centuries. [[Wall Street]], in [[Lower Manhattan]], has been a dominant global financial center since [[World War II]] and is home to the [[New York Stock Exchange]]. The city has been home to several of the [[Skyscraper#History of tallest skyscrapers|tallest buildings in the world]], including the [[Empire State Building]] and the former twin towers of the [[World Trade Center]]. The city is the birthplace of many American cultural movements, including the [[Harlem Renaissance]] in literature and visual art, [[abstract expressionism]] in painting, and [[Hip hop culture|hip hop]]<ref>{{cite book|first=David|last=Toop|title=Rap Attack 2: African Rap to Global Hip Hop|publisher=Serpents Tail|year=1992|isbn=1852422432}}</ref> along with the [[Tin Pan Alley]] in music.

From its beginnings on [[Manhattan Island]], the city spread onto nearby [[Staten Island]], western [[Long Island]], and mainland [[North America]]. The mainland and many islands of New York are linked by a network of [[Bridges and tunnels in New York City|bridges and tunnels]], including the [[Brooklyn Bridge]] and [[Holland Tunnel]]. The [[New York City Subway]], with 660 miles of track, serves an average of 4.9 million passengers per day.<ref>[http://www.mta.info/nyct/facts/ffsubway.htm Subways], [[New York City Transit Authority]]. Accessed [[June 9]], [[2007]].</ref> Two airports are located in New York City, and the surrounding [[Tri-State Region]] offers many other cultural, economic, and transportation options. To manage its tremendous infrastructure, the city has one of the most [[devolution|devolved]] governments in the country, including the ability to collect [[income tax]].

The city was founded as the colony of [[New Amsterdam]] by [[Dutch colonization of the Americas|Dutch colonists]] in the early 17th century, being ceded as part of the [[Province of New York]] to the [[Kingdom of England|English]] in 1664. The [[Borough (New York City)|five boroughs]] were consolidated into one city in 1898. It has been central to the development of the United States, serving as the nation's first [[capital|capital city]] in 1789, and has had a large influence in American media, finance, and politics. 
It is the site of some of the country's greatest celebrations, including [[ticker-tape parade]]s for returning [[astronaut]]s and the celebrations in [[Times Square]] of [[Victory over Japan Day|the end]] of [[World War II]], but has also seen tragic times, such as the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]].

==History==
{{main|History of New York City}}
At the time of its European discovery in 1524 by [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]], the region was inhabited by the [[Lenape]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]].<ref name="rodgers">{{cite book |title=New York: the World's Capital City, Its Development and Contributions to Progress |author=Rankin, Rebecca B., Cleveland Rodgers |publisher=Harper |year=1948}}</ref> But it was not until the voyage of [[Henry Hudson]], an [[England|Englishman]] hired by the [[Dutch East India Company]] to find a route to China, that the area was mapped.<ref name="rodgers"/>  He discovered [[Manhattan Island]] on [[September 11]], [[1609]], and continued up the river that bears his name, the [[Hudson River]], until he arrived at the site where New York State's capital city, [[Albany, New York|Albany]], now stands. His aim to find a route to China had failed but what he had discovered was something even better, the largest natural harbor in the New World on the island of Manhattan and the third largest in the entire world.

Realizing the immense potential of this harbor, the Dutch settlement began with the founding of a [[fur trade|fur trading]] settlement, later called "[[New Amsterdam]]," ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]- "Nieuw Amsterdam") on the southern tip of Manhattan in 1614. The initial settlers were not Dutch at all but Belgian and French Huguenots escaping religious persecution in Europe. Dutch colonial Director-General [[Peter Minuit]] purchased the island of Manhattan from the Canarsie Native Americans in 1626.<ref>Legend, now disproved, says that Manhattan was purchased for $24 worth of glass beads. (Miller, 1986)</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Miller, Christopher L., George R. Hamell |date=September 1986 |title=A New Perspective on Indian-White Contact: Cultural Symbols and Colonial Trade |journal=The Journal of American History |volume=73 |issue=2 |url=http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0021-8723%28198609%2973%3A2%3C311%3AANPOIC%3E2.0.CO%3B2-A |accessdate=2007-03-21}}</ref> In 1664, the [[British Empire|British]] conquered the city, and there by uniting their colonies in [[Massachusetts]] and [[Virginia]] and renamed the city, "New York" after the English [[James II of England|Duke of York]], the heir to the throne.
[[Image:Castelloplan.jpg|230px|thumb|Lower Manhattan in 1660, when it was part of [[New Amsterdam]]]]
New York City grew in importance as a trading port while under British rule.  In 1754, [[Columbia University]] was founded under charter by [[King George II]] as King's College in Lower Manhattan.  During the [[American Revolutionary War]], the city emerged as the theater for a series of major battles known as the [[New York Campaign]] which raged from [[1776]] through [[1777]]. The [[Congress of the Confederation]] met in New York City from 1785 to 1789, and the city officially became the [[List of capitals in the United States|capital]] on [[September 13]], [[1788]].  The first [[President of the United States]], [[George Washington]], was inaugurated at [[Federal Hall]] on Wall Street in April 1789.<ref>{{cite web | title = The People's Vote: President George Washington's First Inaugural Speech (1789) | publisher = U.S. News and World Report | url = http://www.usnews.com/usnews/documents/docpages/document_page11.htm | accessdate = 2007-05-28 }}</ref>  New York City remained the capital until [[1790]], when the Federal government relocated to [[Philadelphia]].
 
New York City quickly became the nation's dominant trading center when the [[Erie Canal]] was completed in 1825, connecting the Atlantic port to the vast agricultural markets of the North American interior.<ref name="lankevich-p67">Lankevich (1998), pp. 67<U+2013>68.</ref>  
The [[Commissioners' Plan of 1811]], which created a rational street grid to encompass most of Manhattan, helped guide expansion of the city.<ref>{{cite book
|author = Bridges, William | title = Map Of The City Of New York And Island Of Manhattan With Explanatory Remarks And References | date = 1811}}</ref>  By 1835, New York City had surpassed [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] as the largest city in the United States, with [[immigration]] playing an important role in growth.  The [[Irish Potato Famine]] brought a large influx of [[Irish people|Irish]] immigrants, and by 1850, the Irish comprised one quarter of the city's population.<ref>{{cite book |title=The New York Irish |author=Bayor, Ronald H. |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |year=1997 |id=ISBN 0801857643 |pages=p. 91}}</ref>  Government institutions, including the [[New York City Police Department]] and the [[New York City Department of Education|public schools]], were established in the 1840s and 1850s to respond to growing demands of residents.<ref name="lankevich-p84">Lankevich (1998), pp. 84<U+2013>85.</ref>  Public-minded members of the old merchant aristocracy pressed for [[Central Park]], which became the first landscaped park in an American city in 1857.  Local politics fell under the domination of [[Tammany Hall]], a [[political machine]] supported by Irish immigrants. 
[[Image:Old timer structural worker.jpg|thumb|left|230px|Construction of the [[Empire State Building]], 1930.]]
Anger at military conscription during the [[American Civil War]] (1861<U+2013>1865) led to the [[New York Draft Riots|Draft Riots of 1863]], one of the worst incidents of civil unrest in American history.  Eleven black men were lynched over a five day period, and hundreds of blacks forced out of the city.<ref>{{cite book | author = Harris, Leslie M. | title = In the Shadow of Slavery | publisher = The University of Chicago Press | date = 2003 | pages = pp. 279<U+2013>288| id = ISBN 0226317749 }}</ref> In 1898 the modern City of New York was formed with the consolidation of Brooklyn (until then an independent city), Manhattan and municipalities in the other boroughs. The opening of the [[New York City Subway]] in 1904 helped bind the new city together. Throughout the first half of the 20th century, the city became a world center for industry, commerce, and communication. In 1911 the [[Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire]], the city's worst industrial disaster, took the lives of 146 garment workers and spurred the growth of the [[International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union]] and major improvements in factory safety standards.<ref name="cornell1">{{cite web |url=http://www.ilr.cornell.edu/trianglefire/ |title=Cornell University Library: Triangle Factory Fire |publisher=Cornell University |accessdate=2007-03-12}}</ref>

In the 1920s, New York City was a major destination for [[African Americans]] during the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] from the American South. By 1916, New York City was home to the largest urban African diaspora in North America. The [[Harlem Renaissance]] flourished during the era of [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]], and coincident with a larger economic boom that saw the construction of a skyline filled with competing [[skyscrapers]]. New York City became the most populous city in the world in 1925, overtaking [[London]], which had reigned for a century. The difficult years of the [[Great Depression]] saw the election of reformer [[Fiorello LaGuardia]] and the fall of [[Tammany Hall]] after eighty years of political dominance.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Tiger <U+2013> The Rise and Fall of Tammany Hall |author=Allen, Oliver E. |publisher=Addison-Wesley Publishing Company |accessdate=2007-05-25 |chapter=Chapter 9: The Decline |date=1993}}</ref>

Returning [[World War II]] veterans and immigrants from Europe created a postwar economic boom and the development of huge housing tracts in eastern Queens. Ironically, the city's prosperity would lead many middle class residents to the new suburban developments in [[Long Island]] such as [[Levittown, New York|Levittown]], aided by the bridges and thoroughfairs constructed under [[Robert Moses]].<ref>{{cite news | author =GoldBerger, Paul | title =Robert Moses, Master Builder, is Dead at 92 | publisher =[[New York Times Company]] | date =[[July 30]], [[1981]] | url=http://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/1218.html | accessdate = 2007-05-28 }}</ref> New York emerged from the war unscathed and the leading city of the world, with [[Wall Street]] leading America's rise as the world's dominant economic power.  In 1952, the [[United Nations]] established its headquarters in New York City.  The rise of [[Abstract Expressionism]] in the city made New York an important center of the art world.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Center of the World - New York: A Documentary  Film (Transcript) |author=Burns, Ric |publisher=PBS |url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/newyork/filmmore/pt.html| accessdate=2006-07-20 |date=2003-08-22}}</ref> 

Like many large American cities, New York suffered a decline in manufacturing and rising crime rates, race riots, and [[white flight]] in the 1960s. By the 1970s, the city had gained a reputation as a crime-ridden relic of history.  In the 1980s, a resurgence in the financial industry improved the city's fiscal health.  By the 1990s, racial tensions had calmed, crime rates dropped dramatically, and waves of new immigrants arrived from Asia and Latin America. Important new sectors, such as [[Silicon Alley]], emerged in the city's economy and New York's population reached an all-time high in the [[United States Census 2000|2000 census]].  The city was one of the sites of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], when nearly 3,000 people died in the destruction of the [[World Trade Center]].  The [[Freedom Tower]] will be built on the site and is scheduled for completion in 2010.<ref>{{cite web | title = World Trade Center: Frequently Asked Questions | url=http://www.wtc.com/inner_page.aspx?id=14 | publisher = Silverstein Properties | accessdate = 2007-05-25 }}</ref>

==Geography==
{{main|Geography of New York City|Geography of New York Harbor}}
[[Image:Aster newyorkcity lrg.jpg|230px|thumb|right|Satellite image showing most of the five boroughs, portions of eastern New Jersey, and the main waterways around New York harbor. Over 9 million people live in the imaged area.]]
New York City is located in the [[Northeastern United States]], in southeastern [[New York]] state, approximately halfway between [[Washington, D.C.]] and [[Boston]].<ref>Washington, D.C. is 228 miles driving distance from New York City, and Boston is 217 miles driving distance from New York. - [http://maps.google.com/ Google Maps]</ref>  The location at the mouth of the [[Hudson River]], which feeds into a naturally sheltered harbor, has helped the city grow in significance as a trading city.  Much of New York is built on the three islands of Manhattan, Staten Island, and western Long Island, making land scarce and encouraging a high population density.

The Hudson River flows from the [[Hudson Valley]] into [[New York Bay]], becoming a [[tidal estuary]] that separates the city from [[New Jersey]]. The [[East River]], actually a tidal strait, flows from [[Long Island Sound]] and separates the Bronx and Manhattan from Long Island. The [[Harlem River]], another tidal strait between the East and Hudson Rivers, separates Manhattan from the Bronx.

The city's land has been altered considerably by human intervention, with substantial [[land reclamation]] along the waterfronts since Dutch colonial times. Reclamation is most notable in [[Lower Manhattan]], with developments such as [[Battery Park City]] in the 1970s and 1980s.<ref name="gillespie-p71">{{cite book |author=Gillespie, Angus K. |year=1999 |title=Twin Towers: The Life of New York City's World Trade Center |publisher=Rutgers University Press |pages=p. 71}}</ref>  Much of the natural variations in topography have been evened out, particularly in Manhattan.<ref>{{cite book |author=Lopate , Phillip |title=Waterfront: A Walk Around Manhattan |publisher=Anchor Press |year=2004 |isbn=0385497148}}</ref>

=== Climate ===

Although located at about the same latitude as the much warmer European cities of [[Naples]] and [[Madrid]], New York has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[K<U+00F6>ppen classification]] Dfa) resulting from prevailing wind patterns that bring cool air from the interior of the North American continent.<ref name="NYC climate">{{cite web|title=The Climate of New York|publisher=New York State Climate Office|url=http://nysc.eas.cornell.edu/climate_of_ny.html|accessdate=2007-03-27}}</ref> The city's coastal position keeps temperatures relatively warmer than inland regions during winter, helping to moderate the amount of snow which averages 25 to 35&nbsp;inches (63.5 to 88.9&nbsp;cm) each year.<ref name="NYC climate"/>  New York City has a frost-free period lasting an average of 220 days between seasonal freezes.<ref name="NYC climate" />  Spring and Fall in New York City are mild, while summer is very warm and humid, with temperatures of 90<U+00B0>F (32<U+00B0>C) or higher recorded from 18 to 25 days on average during the season.<ref name="NYC climate" /> The city's longterm climate patterns are affected by the [[Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation]], a 70-year-long warming and cooling cycle in the Atlantic that influences the frequency and severity of hurricanes and coastal storms in the region.<ref>{{cite web|author=Riley, Mary Elizabeth|title=Assessing the Impact of Interannual Climate Variability on New York City's Reservoir System|year=2006|publisher=Cornell University Graduate School for Atmospheric Science |url=http://dspace.library.cornell.edu/bitstream/1813/2623/1/MER+Thesis-new.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2007-03-27}}</ref>

The building form most closely associated with New York City is the [[skyscraper]], a pioneering urban form that saw city building shift from the low-scale European tradition to the vertical rise of business districts. Surrounded mostly by water, New York's residential density and high real estate values in commercial districts saw the city amass the largest collection of individual, free-standing office and [[tower block|residential towers]] in the world.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Emporis|title=About New York City|url=http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/ci/?id=newyorkcity-ny-usa|accessdate=2007-03-21}}</ref>

New York has architecturally significant buildings in a wide range of styles. These include the [[Woolworth Building]] (1913), an early [[gothic revival architecture|gothic revival]] skyscraper built with massively scaled gothic detailing able to be read from street level several hundred feet below. The [[1916 Zoning Resolution]] required [[Setback (architecture)|setback]] in new buildings, and restricted towers to a percentage of the lot size, to allow sunlight to reach the streets below.<ref>{{cite journal |title=The Metropolitan Dimension of Early Zoning: Revisiting the 1916 New York City Ordinance |author=Fischler, Raphael |journal=Journal of the American Planning Association |volume=64(2) |year=1998}}</ref>  The [[Art Deco]] design of the [[Chrysler Building]] (1930), with its tapered top and steel spire, reflected the zoning requirements.  The building is considered by many historians and architects to be New York's finest building, with its distinctive ornamentation such as replicas at the corners of the 61st floor of the 1928 Chrysler eagle hood ornaments and V-shaped lighting inserts capped by a steel spire at the tower's crown.<ref>{{cite web |title=Favorites! 100 Experts Pick Their top 10 New York Towers |publisher=The Skyscraper Museum |date=[[January 22]], [[2006]] |url=http://www.skyscraper.org/EXHIBITIONS/FAVORITES/fav_exhibits.htm# |accessdate=2007-04-11}}</ref>  A highly influential example of the [[international style (architecture)|international style]] in the United States is the [[Seagram Building]] (1957), distinctive for its facade using visible bronze-toned I-beams to evoke the building's structure. The [[Cond<U+00E9> Nast Building]] (2000) is an important example of [[green design]] in American skyscrapers.<ref name="greenbuilding" />

The character of New York's large residential districts is often defined by the elegant [[brownstone]] [[rowhouse]]s, [[townhouse]]s, and [[tenement]]s that were built during a period of rapid expansion from 1870 to 1930.<ref>{{cite book |title=History of Housing in New York City: Dwelling Type and Change in the American Metropolis |author=Plunz, Richar A. |chapter=Chapters 3 [Rich and Poor] & 4 [Beyond the Tenement] |year=1990 |publisher=Columbia University Press |id=ISBN 0231062974}}</ref>  Stone and brick became the city's building materials of choice after the construction of wood-frame houses was limited in the aftermath of the [[Great Fire of New York|Great Fire of 1835]].<ref name="lankevich-p82">Lankevich (1998), pp. 82<U+2013>83.</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=New York: Old & New: Its Story, Streets, and Landmarks |author=Wilson, Rufus Rockwell |year=1902 |publisher=J.B.

Strongly influenced by the city's immigrants, these productions used song in narratives that often reflected themes of hope and ambition. Today these productions are a mainstay of the New York theatre scene.

New York City is exceptionally diverse. Throughout its history the city has been a major point of entry for immigrants; the term "[[melting pot]]" was first coined to describe densely populated immigrant neighborhoods on the [[Lower East Side, Manhattan|Lower East Side]]. 36% of the city's population is foreign-born.<ref name="NYC immigration" /> Among American cities, this proportion is higher only in [[Los Angeles]] and [[Miami]].<ref name="census2000" /> While the immigrant communities in those cities are dominated by a few nationalities, in New York no single country or region of origin dominates. The ten largest countries of origin for modern day immigration are the [[Dominican Republic]], [[China]], [[Jamaica]],  [[Guyana]], [[Mexico]], [[Ecuador]], [[Haiti]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[Colombia]] and [[Russia]]. The largest ethnic groups in New York City are African American, Italian, Jewish, and Irish. <ref>{{cite web |title=Appendix Table 5-4: Ten Largest Sources of the Foreign-Born by County New York Metropolitan Region, 2000 |publisher=New York City Department of City Planning |date=2005 |url=http://home2.nyc.gov/html/dcp/pdf/census/nny_table_5_4.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2007-03-26}}</ref> About 170 languages are spoken in the city.<ref name="languages in NYC" />

The New York City metropolitan area is home to the largest [[American Jews|Jewish community]] outside [[Israel]]; [[Tel Aviv]] proper (non-metro/within municipal limits) has smaller population than the Jewish population of New York City proper, making New York the largest Jewish community in the world.<ref>{{cite web |title=Jewish Community Study of New York |publisher=United Jewish Appeal-Federation of New York |date=2002 |url=http://www.ujafedny.org/atf/cf/%7BAD848866-09C4-482C-9277-51A5D9CD6246%7D/JCommStudyIntro.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2007-03-26}}</ref> It is also home to nearly a quarter of the nation's [[Indian-American|South Asians]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Census Profile:New York City's Indian American Population |publisher=Asian American Federation of New York |date=2004 |url=http://www.aafny.org/cic/briefs/indianamer.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2007-03-28}}</ref> and the largest [[African American]] community of any city in the country. There is also a substantial [[Puerto Rican]] and [[Dominican]] population. Another historically significant ethnic group are [[Italian people|Italians]], who emigrated to the city in large numbers in the early twentieth century.

{{main|Government of New York City}}
[[Image:Nyc city hall jan06a.jpg|thumb|230px|[[New York City Hall]] is the seat of city government.]]
Since its consolidation in 1898, New York City has been a [[metropolitan municipality]] with a "strong" [[Mayor-council government|mayor-council form of government]]. The government of New York is more centralized than that of most other U.S. cities. In New York City, the central government is responsible for public education, correctional institutions, libraries, public safety, recreational facilities, sanitation, water supply and welfare services.  The [[Mayor of New York City|mayor]] and [[councillor]]s are elected to four-year terms. The [[New York City Council]] is a [[unicameralism|unicameral]] body consisting of 51 Council members whose districts are defined by geographic population boundaries.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nyccouncil.info/tools/about_council.cfm |title=About the Council |publisher=New York City Council |accessdate=2007-06-06}}</ref>  The mayor and councilors are limited to two four-year terms.  

The mayor is [[Michael Bloomberg]], a former Democrat elected as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] in 2001 and re-elected in 2005 with 59% of the vote.<ref>{{cite web |title=Statement and Return Report for Certification: General Election 2005 |publisher=New York City Board of Elections |date=[[November 8]], [[2005]] |url=http://www.vote.nyc.ny.us/pdf/results/2005/general/Manhattan/New%20York%20Mayor%20NY%20Recap.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2006-07-19}}</ref> He is known for taking control of the city's education system from the state, rezoning and economic development, sound fiscal management, and aggressive public health policy.

[[Image:NYC NYPD Times Square.jpg|thumb|left|165px|An NYPD vehicle stationed in Times Square.]]
New York is the most important source of political fundraising in the United States, as four of the top five [[ZIP Code|zip codes]] in the nation for political contributions are in Manhattan. The top zip code, 10021 on the [[Upper East Side]], generated the most money for the 2004 presidential campaigns of both [[George W. Bush]] and [[John Kerry]].<ref>{{cite web|title=2006 Election Overview: Top Zip Codes |publisher=Opensecrets.org |url=http://www.opensecrets.org/overview/topzips.asp?cycle=2004 |accessdate=2006-07-19}}</ref>  The city has a strong imbalance of payments with the national and state governments. New York City receives 83 cents in services for every $1 it sends to the federal government in [[Taxation in the United States|taxes]] (or annually sends $11.4 billion more than it receives back). The city also sends an additional $11 billion more each year to the state of New York than it receives back.<ref>{{cite web |title=A Fair Share of State Budget: Does Albany Play Fair with NYC?|publisher=New York City Finance Division |date=[[March 11]], [[2005]] |url=http://webdocs.nyccouncil.info/attachments/65379.htm?CFID=232457&CFTOKEN=33008944 |accessdate=2006-07-19}}</ref>

=== Crime ===
{{main|Crime in New York City}}
[[Organized crime]] has long been associated with New York City, beginning with the [[40 Thieves|Forty Thieves]] and the [[Roach Guards]] in the [[Five Points]] in the 1820s, notorious [[mobster]]s [[Arnold Rothstein]], [[Meyer Lansky]], and [[Lucky Luciano]] in the 20th century, [[gang]]s including the [[Black Spades]], and more recently the [[Bloods]] and [[Crips]] who arrived from [[Los Angeles]].<ref>{{cite book |title=NYPD: A City and Its Police |author=Lardner, James, and Thomas Reppetto |publisher=Owl Books |year=2000 |pages=pp. 18<U+2013>21}}</ref>  Numerous major riots have occurred in New York City since the mid-1800s, including the [[New York Draft Riots|Draft Riots]] in 1863, multiple riots at [[Tompkins Square Park]], and in [[Harlem]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Street Justice: A History of Political Violence in New York City |author=Johnson, Marilynn S. |publisher=Beacon Press |year=2003}}</ref>  The serial killings by the "[[David Berkowitz|Son of Sam]]", which began on [[July 29]], [[1976]], terrorized the city for the next year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/notorious/berkowitz/12.html |title=Son of Sam, David Berkowitz, famous serial killer |publisher=Crime Library / Court TV |accessdate=2007-06-06}}</ref>

Crime rates spiked in the 1980s and early 1990s, as the [[crack epidemic]] hit New York City.  During the 1990s, the [[New York City Police Department]] adopted [[CompStat]], [[broken windows]] policing, and other strategies in effort to reduce crime.  These efforts, along with other factors such as changing demographics, helped reduce crime drastically during the later part of the 1990s and into the 2000s.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Crime Drop in America |chapter=The Rise and Decline of Hard Drugs, Drug Markets, and Violence in Inner-City New York |author=Johnson, Bruce D., Andrew Golub, Eloise Dunlap |editor=Blumstein, Alfred, Joel Wallman |year=2006 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |id=ISBN 0521862795}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=New York Murder Mystery: The True Story Behind the Crime Crash of the 1990s |author=Karmen, Andrew |year=2000 |publisher=NYU Press |id=0814747175}}</ref>  Since 1991, the city has seen a continuous fifteen-year trend of decreasing crime.
