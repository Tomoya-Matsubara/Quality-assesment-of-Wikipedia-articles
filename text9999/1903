==Early life==
Everette Lee DeGolyer was born in a [[sod house]] on October 9, 1886, the son of John and Narcissa Kagy Huddle DeGolyer of [[Greensburg, Kansas]]. He was the first of three children. The family moved to [[Joplin, Missouri]], where Everette attended school while his father worked in lead and zinc mining in the area. In 1901 the family moved to [[Norman, Oklahoma]], where Evereette attended the University of Oklahoma preparatory school.<ref name=perez1>{{cite web|last=Perez|first=Joan Jenkins|title=DeGolyer, Everette Lee|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fde29|work=Handbook of Texas Online|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|accessdate=16 September 2011}}</ref>  DeGolyer attended the [[University of Oklahoma]] beginning in the fall of 1905. During the summers of 1906-1909 he worked for the [[U.S. Geological Survey]], starting as a cook and working up to field assistant. In 1909 DeGolyer began work as a field geologist for the [[Mexican Eagle Petroleum Company]] (''El Aguila Oil Company''), remaining with the company for ten years, where he was involved in the discoveries of the  Potrero del Llano No. 4 in 1910 and the Las Naranjas field after 1911 .DeGolyer married Nell Virginia Goodrich, a teaching assistant at the University of Oklahoma, in 1910, living in [[Tampico, Tamaulipas|Tampico, Mexico]].  DeGolyer returned to the University of Oklahoma to finish his A.B. degree in geology, receiving it in 1911.<ref name=smupapers1>{{cite web|title=Biography of Everette Lee DeGolyer, Sr.|url=http://www.lib.utexas.edu/taro/smu/00003/smu-00003.html|work=Texas Archival Resources Online|publisher=Southern Methodist University|accessdate=16 September 2011}}</ref><ref name=weaver1>{{cite web|last=Weaver|first=Bobby D.|title=DeGolyer, Ererette Lee (1886-1956)|url=http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/D/DE007.html|work=Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture|publisher=Oklahoma State University|accessdate=16 September 2011}}</ref>

==Oil career==
DeGolyer opened a petroleum geology consultancy in 1914, moving to [[Montclair, New Jersey]] to work in New York City in 1916.<ref name=cottrell1>{{cite web|last=Cottrell|first=Debbie Mauldin|title=DeGolyer, Nell Virginia Goodrich|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fdevm|work=Handbook of Texas Online|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|accessdate=17 September 2011}}</ref>  DeGolyer negotiated the sale of El Aguila to [[Royal Dutch Shell]] on behalf of its owner, Lord Cowdray while working as a consultant to Cowdray. In 1919 DeGolyer organized the formation of the Rycade Oil Company as well as the [[Amerada Petroleum Corporation]] for Lord Cowdray, rising to become general manager, president, and chairman from 1929 to 1932 DeGolyer left the firm in 1932, but remained with Rycade, which was established to explore [[salt dome]] oil deposits through 1941.<ref name=perez1/> As a geophysical consultant with Rycade, DeGolyer made the first torsion balance survey in the United States at the [[Spindletop]] oilfield. An oilfield found by DeGolyer on behalf of Rycade at [[Nash, Texas]] was the first oilfield anywhere to be discovered using geophysics.<ref name=weaver1/> From 1925 DeGolyer established the Geophysical Research Corporation as a subsidiary of Amerada to develop [[reflective seismology]] techniques originated by [[J. Clarence Karcher]] and [[Eugene McDermott]], leaving in 1932 to move to [[Dallas, Texas]]. DeGolyer provided financial support for the 1930 establishment of GRC's successor, [[Geophysical Service Incorporated]]. GSI went on to spin off [[Texas Instruments]].<ref name="mrde">Lon Tinkle. Mr. De: A Biography of Everette Lee DeGolyer.</ref>  In 1936 with Lewis MacNaughton, DeGolyer established the petroleum exploration consulting firm [[DeGolyer and MacNaughton]], and Core Laboratories, Incorporated the same year to provide drilling core and fluids analysis. DeGolyer was also associated with the Atlatl Royalty Company from 1932 to 1950 and the Felmont Corporation in 1934. In 1956 he established Isotopes, Incorporated to provide radioactive [[isotopes]] for oilfield and industrial purposes.<ref name=perez1/>

During World War II, DeGolyer served as director of conservation with the [[Office of the Coordinator for National Defense]] from 1941 to 1942. He was assistant deputy of the [[Petroleum Administration for War]] in 1942-43, and was in charge of the [[Petroleum Reserves Corporation]] mission to the Middle East in 1943-44 He was president of the [[American Institute of Mining and Metallurgical Engineers]] in 1927, and was a director of the [[American Petroleum Institute]] for twenty years.<ref name=weaver1/> In 1946, working on behalf of the [[Office of Strategic Services]], the forerunner to the [[Central Intelligence Agency]], DeGolyer recruited [[Jack Crichton (Texas businessman)|Jack Crichton]] of Dallas, to operate a group of companies which frequently were given new names, presumably to make it more difficult to trace their operations. According to investigative journalist [[Russ Baker]] (not to be confused with [[Russell Baker]] of ''[[The New York Times]]''), the companies "operated largely below the radar, and fronted for some of North America's biggest names, including the Bronfmans ([[Seagram's]] liquor), the [[Du Pont]]s, and the Kuhn-Loeb family of financiers."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/MDcrichton.htm|title=Jack Alston Crichton|publisher=spartacus.schoolnet.co|accessdate=April 8, 2010}}</ref> Crichton became a prominent oil and gas industrialist and was the 1964 [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[gubernatorial]] [[nominee]].
