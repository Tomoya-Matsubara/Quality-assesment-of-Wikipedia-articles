The '''architecture of Scotland in the prehistoric era''' includes all human building within the modern borders of Scotland, before the arrival of the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] in Britain in the first century BCE. [[Stone Age]] settlers began to build in wood in what is now Scotland from at least 8,000 years ago. The first permanent houses of stone were constructed around 6,000 years ago, as at [[Knap of Howar]], [[Orkney]] and settlements like [[Skara Brae]]. There are also large numbers of [[chambered tomb]]s and [[cairn]]s from this era, particularly in the west and north. In the south and east there are earthen [[Tumulus|barrow]]s, often linked to timber monuments of which only remnants remain. Related structures include [[bank barrow]]s, [[cursus monument]]s, [[mortuary enclosure]]s and [[Neolithic long house|timber halls]]. From the [[Bronze Age]] there are fewer new buildings, but there is evidence of [[crannog]]s, roundhouses built on an artificial islands and of [[Clava cairn]]s and the first [[hillfort]]s. From the [[Iron Age]] there is evidence of substantial stone [[Atlantic roundhouse]]s, which include [[broch]] towers, smaller [[duns]]. There is also evidence of about 1,000 [[List of hill forts in Scotland|hillforts in Scotland]], most located below the Clyde-Forth line.

The oldest house for which there is evidence in Britain is the oval structure of wooden posts found at [[South Queensferry]] near the [[Firth of Forth]], dating from the [[Mesolithic]] period, about 8240 BCE.<ref>R.

There are also large numbers of [[chambered tomb]]s and [[Chambered cairn|cairns]] from this period. Many different types have been identified, but they can be roughly grouped into [[passage grave]]s, [[gallery grave]]s and [[stone cist]]s. Cists are relatively simple box-like graves, usually made up of stone slaps and covered with a large stone or slab.<ref>G.

In contrast to the Highlands and Islands where stone was extensively used, in the south and east the most visible architectural survivals of the Neolithic are mainly earthen [[Tumulus|barrow]]s, the earliest probably dating from the beginning of the fourth millennium BCE. Today these monuments consist of massive mounds of earth or stone, most commonly trapezoidal in plan and often orientated to the east. They are widely distributed in the Lowlands, particularly in Aberdeenshire, Angus, Dumfries and Galloway and the Scottish Borders.<ref>G. Noble, ''Neolithic Scotland: Timber, Stone, Earth and Fire'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2006), ISBN 0748623388, p. 71.</ref> Related structures include [[bank barrow]]s, [[cursus monument]]s, [[mortuary enclosure]]s, [[Neolithic long house|timber halls]], and other forms of enclosure.<ref>G. Noble, ''Neolithic Scotland: Timber, Stone, Earth and Fire'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2006), ISBN 0748623388, p. 45.</ref> Bank barrows are parallel-sided mounds, usually flanked by ditches on either side. Originally believed to be Roman in origin, cursus monuments also consist of long parallel lengths of banks of earth with external ditches, but with an open avenue or enclose between. Both forms are usually associated with burial chambers.<ref>J. Pollard, ''Neolithic Britain'' (Osprey, 2008), ISBN 0747803536, pp. 39-40.</ref> Examples of bank barrows in Scotland include from Perthshire the long mound at Auchenlaich and the hybrid bank barrow/cursus monument and at Cleaven Dyke, which stretches for over {{convert|1.5|miles|km|0}}.<ref>R.

Maxwell, ''The Cleaven Dyke and Littleour: Monuments in the Neolithic of Tayside'' (Society Antiquaries Scotland, 1998), ISBN 090390313X, p. xii.</ref> Mortuary enclosures are usually sub-rectangular banks with external ditches and raised platforms of stone or wood within them, thought by J. G. Scott to be used for the exposure of corpses prior to burial elsewhere, although this interpretation is disputed. Remains of mortuary enclosures of this period are often found under [[long barrow]]s. Key examples include Pitnacree, Perthshire and two closely related sites at Lochhill and Slewcairn, both in [[Kirkcudbright]].<ref>G. Noble, ''Neolithic Scotland: Timber, Stone, Earth and Fire'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2006), ISBN 0748623388, pp. 72-4.</ref> The timber halls are probably unique to Scotland and were massive roofed buildings made of oak, all of which seem to have been subsequently burnt down. There is debate as to the role of these buildings, which have been seen variously as regular farming homesteads of Neolithic families and as related to a series of monumental constructions such as barrows.<ref>G.

As bronze working developed from about 2000 BCE, there was a decline in the building of large new structures, which, with a reduction of the total area under cultivation, suggests a fall in population.<ref>A.

Armit, '' Towers in the North: The Brochs of Scotland'' (Stroud: Tempus, 2003), ISBN 0-7524-1932-3, p. 28.</ref> There is also evidence of the occupation of [[crannog]]s, roundhouses partially or entirely built on an artificial islands, usually in lakes, rivers and estuarine waters.<ref>N. Dixon ''The Crannogs of Scotland: An Underwater Archaeology'' (Stroud: Tempus, 2004), ISBN 0-7524-3151-X.</ref> They were often constructed of layers of brushwood and rubble. Sometimes they were [[Revetment|revetted]] around the edges with vertical [[Deep foundation|piles]] and sometimes surfaced with logs of oak.<ref name=Cunliffe2004p340/> 

The creation of cairns and Megalithic monuments continued into this period. There are approximately fifty [[Clava cairn]]s in Scotland, named after those at Balnuaran of Clava near Inverness. They take take two distinct forms, either a circular rubble enclosure known as "ring cairns", or passage graves, with a long entrance, usually in complex astronomical alignments.<ref>C.

In the early Iron Age, from the seventh century BCE, cellular houses begin to be replaced on the northern isles by simple [[Atlantic roundhouse]]s, substantial circular buildings with a drystone construction. Important examples are at Quanterness, Bu, [[Pierowall]], and Tofts Ness on Orkney, and at Clickhimin on Shetland. From about 400 BC more complex Atlantic roundhouses began to be built, as at Howe, Orkney and [[Crosskirk Broch|Crosskirk]], Caithness.<ref name=Cunliffe2004p325>B.

The most massive constructions that date from this era are the circular [[broch]] towers, probably dating from about 200 BCE. They are drystone hollow-walled structures that are unique to Scotland.<ref name=Cunliffe2004p325/> Most ruins only survive up to a few metres above ground level, although there are five extant examples of towers whose walls still exceed {{convert|21|ft|m|0}} in height.<ref>I.
