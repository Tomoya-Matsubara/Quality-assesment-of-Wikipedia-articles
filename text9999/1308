'''Chiou I-jen''' ({{zh-tp|t=<U+90B1><U+7FA9><U+4EC1>|p=Qiu Yiren}}), born [[May 9]], [[1950]], is the current [[Premier of the Republic of China|Vice Premier]] of the [[Republic of China]] ([[Taiwan]]).

==Early career==
Chiou was born in 1950 in [[Pingtung County]] in southern [[Taiwan]].  He earned a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in [[Philosophy]] from [[National Taiwan University]] in 1972, and subsequently attended the [[University of Chicago]], where he earned an [[Master of Arts|MA]] in [[Political Science]].<ref>[http://www.gio.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=18729&ctNode=2580 Vice Premier CHIOU I-jen] ''The Government Information Office, Republic of China''</ref>  While attending the University of Chicago, Chiou was an influential member of the Taiwanese democratization movement, earning himself the nickname "Loudspeaker."<ref>[http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/2007/02/08/102020/President-tells.htm President tells Chiou to be media's 'best friend'] ''The China Post'', Taiwan Page staff, February 8, 2007</ref>

==Foundation of the [[Democratic Progressive Party|Democratic Progressive Party]]==
Chiou returned to Taiwan, and in 1983, members of the "New [[Tangwai]] Generation," including Chiou I-jen, formed the "Association of Tangwai Editors and Writers."<ref>[http://www.pladaily.com.cn Origin and Development of Adverse Current of 'Taiwan Independence'] ''Jiefangjun Bao'', Sun Shengliang, May 29, 2000</ref>  The group was focused on bringing democracy to Taiwan, enshrining that goal in their charter: "...Taiwan's future should be decided by its 18 million inhabitants."  The charter went on to say "...the people of Taiwan have the right to choose independence."  In 1986, Chiou, along with other members of the Tangwai movement, helped the movement coalesce into a coherent political party, thus forming the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] or DPP.  Given that the [[Kuomintang|KMT]] still ruled the island at the time and did not allow much at all in the way of political opposition, the DPP opted to take a low profile, yet continued to advocate its message of [[self-determination]] for Taiwan.  Chiou's "New Tangwai Generation" group stuck together and formed the New Tide Faction within the DPP.

As the political climate in Taiwan grew less oppressive and more open, the DPP flourished and began competing with the KMT in elections. In the late 1990s, Chiou was appointed Secretary General of the DPP by party Chairman [[Hsu Hsin-liang]], but resigned from the post in 1998 to take responsibility for the poor performance of the DPP in the three-in-one elections.  The DPP had also begun sending its own representatives to the [[United States]], so as to counterbalance the views of the official KMT-run [[Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office]].  Subsequent to his resignation as DPP Secretary General, Chiou was appointed DPP representative, and was sent to Washington, DC.  

==Election of [[Chen Shui-bian]] and government service==
While serving as DPP representative to Washington, Chiou also served as the campaign manager for former [[Taipei City|Taipei]] Mayor [[Chen Shui-bian]], who was running as the DPP candidate for [[President of the Republic of China|Presdient]].  With Chen's election, Chiou was appointed Deputy Secretary General of the National Security Council.  Shortly thereafter, Chiou was appointed Secretary General for the [[Executive Yuan]], giving him a stronger hand in shaping government policy.  

Chiou served in the EY until early 2002, when [[Yu Shyi-kun]] was appointed [[Premier of the Republic of China|Premier]].  Premier Yu removed Chiou from his position as EY Secretary General and moved him to a position as minister without portfolio.  In March 2002, Ting Yu-chou stepped down as Secretary General of the National Security Council, and President Chen selected Chiou to replaced him.  Chiou served in this position from 2002-2003.

In January of 2003, in a reshuffle of personnel designed to better enable the DPP to wage its campaign for the [[Republic of China presidential election, 2004|2004 Presidential election]], President Chen moved Chiou from his position as NSC Secretary General to become the Secretary General of the Presidential Office, earning him the monniker "The Permanent Secretary General."<ref>[http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2003/01/22/191906 New lineup prepares for 2004 contest] ''Taipei Times'', Lin Chieh-Yu and Ko Shu-Ling, January 22, 2003</ref>  Regarded as the DPP's top elections strategist,<ref>[http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2003/01/22/191906 New lineup prepares for 2004 contest] ''Taipei Times'', Lin Chieh-Yu and Ko Shu-Ling, January 22, 2003</ref> Chiou once again successfully managed Chen's campaign, despite the [[3-19 shooting incident|apparent assassination attempt]] on President Chen and [[Vice President of the Republic of China|Vice President]] [[Annette Lu]]. 

After the successful conclusion of the 2004 election, Chiou was moved back to the National Security Council as Secretary General, and remained there until early 2007, when he was moved back to the Presidential Office as Secretary General.  On [[May 17]], [[2007]], along with the rest of the Cabinet of out-going [[Premier of the Republic of China|Premier]] [[Su Tseng-chang]], Dr. [[Tsai Ing-wen]] resigned to make way for incoming [[Premier of the Republic of China|Premier]] [[Chang Chun-hsiung]] and his Cabinet.  Premier Chang named Chiou I-jen, to replace Dr. Tsai as [[Premier of the Republic of China|Vice Premier]].<ref>[http://www.chinapost.com.tw/news/archives/front/2007517/109921.htm Taiwan's new premier picks tough strategist as deputy in limited Cabinet reshuffle] ''The [[China Post]]'', May 17, 2007</ref>
