==Background==
The album featured earlier cuts of later Jonas Brothers songs such as "Time for Me to Fly" and "[[When You Look Me in the Eyes]]", and it also featured a cover of the [[Steve Winwood]] hit "Higher Love". The song "Crazy Kinda Crush" was featured on the show ''Darcy's Wild Life''. After the [[Jonas Brothers]] were signed as an act to [[Daylight Records|Daylight]] and [[Columbia Records]] in 2005, Nick put his solo career on hold. They released their first album, ''[[It's About Time (Jonas Brothers album)|It's About Time]]'', on August 8, 2006. The song "Time for Me to Fly" was also used in the credits of the movie ''[[Aquamarine (film)|Aquamarine]]'' starring [[Emma Roberts]], [[JoJo (singer)|JoJo]], and [[Sara Paxton]].
