'''Diaspora Yeshiva Band''' ({{lang-he|<U+05DC><U+05D4><U+05E7><U+05EA> <U+05D9><U+05E9><U+05D9><U+05D1><U+05EA> <U+05D4><U+05EA><U+05E4><U+05D5><U+05E6><U+05D5><U+05EA>}}) was an [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] band founded at the Diaspora Yeshiva on [[Mount Zion]], [[Jerusalem]], by ''[[baal teshuva]]'' students from the United States. In existence from 1975 to 1983, the band infused [[Rock music|rock]] and [[bluegrass]] with Jewish lyrics, creating a style of music it called "Hasidic rock"{{sfn|Tilbury|1989|p=193}} or "Country and Eastern".<ref name=bio>{{cite web |url= http://www.diasporaband.com/biography/|title=Biography|publisher=Diaspora Yeshiva Band|year=2014|accessdate=16 November 2014}}</ref><ref name=forward>{{cite web |url= http://forward.com/articles/13320/a-jewish-pop-band-worth-the-wait-/|title=A Jewish Pop Band Worth the Wait|first=Alexander|last=Gelfand|date=8 May 2008|accessdate=16 November 2014|work=[[The Forward]]}}</ref> The band was very popular on college campuses in the early to mid-1980s, and was famous in Jerusalem for its Saturday-night concerts at [[David's Tomb]]. It had a considerable influence on [[contemporary Jewish religious music]], inspiring later bands such as [[Blue Fringe]], Even Sh'siyah, Piamenta, [[Reva l'sheva]], [[Soulfarm]], the [[Moshav (band)|Moshav Band]], and [[Shlock Rock]]. Fifteen years after it disbanded, band leader Avraham Rosenblum revamped the band under the name "Avraham Rosenblum & Diaspora" and produced several more albums.

==Background==
The Diaspora Yeshiva was founded in 1967 by Rabbi Mordechai Goldstein, an alumnus of the Chofetz Chaim Yeshiva in [[Queens]], New York, and a colleague of Rabbi [[Shlomo Carlebach (musician)|Shlomo Carlebach]].{{sfn|Lange|Diethard Romheld|Weigol|2011|p=330}} The Diaspora Yeshiva was the first [[Orthodox Jewish outreach|outreach]] yeshiva for [[Baal teshuva movement|''baalei teshuva'']].{{sfn|Lange|Diethard Romheld|Weigol|2011|p=330}}{{sfn|Kaplan|2013|p=291}} Unlike traditional rabbinic academies, the yeshiva reached out to young Jewish men who had never been exposed to traditional [[Torah study|Torah]] or [[Talmud]] study. It offered introductory and intermediate courses together with acclimation to an Orthodox Jewish lifestyle.{{sfn|Lange|Diethard Romheld|Weigol|2011|p=330}} To appeal to students who identified with the [[hippie]] [[subculture]] prevalent on college campuses in those years, the yeshiva adopted a [[Neo-Hasidism|neo-Hasidic]] approach. Students were encouraged to keep their long hair and their musical instruments.{{sfn|Lange|Diethard Romheld|Weigol|2011|p=331}} 

Numerous students were professional or semi-professional musicians, and several musical collaborations were spawned in the yeshiva dorms.<ref name=mish/> In 1975 student Avraham Rosenblum, a rock guitarist who had started his own band in New York in 1970, founded the Diaspora Yeshiva Band.<ref name=mish/>{{sfn|Strom|2011|p=196}} The band became an outreach tool for other hippie students and, later, post-hippie seekers, using [[Jewish music]] to draw them into the milieu of [[Torah study]].{{sfn|Lange|Diethard Romheld|Weigol|2011|p=331}}<ref name=mish/>

==History==
The Diaspora Yeshiva Band staged its first concert at the Beit Ha'am hall in the [[Nachlaot]] neighborhood of Jerusalem during [[Hanukkah]] 1975.<ref name=mish/> After that, the band became well-known for its weekly Saturday-night concerts held in a room adjacent to [[David's Tomb]] (located in the same courtyard as the yeshiva) on Mount Zion.<ref name=mish/>{{sfn|Selavan|1993|p=88}}{{sfn|Sofer|1995|p=92}} These concerts attracted American, British and French secular youth; yeshiva and seminary students; and Israeli soldiers.<ref name=mish/> Band members continued to perform with the group even after they had married and begun studying in [[kollel]].<ref name=mish/> 

The band released its first album in 1976.{{sfn|Strom|2011|p=196}}<ref name=beatles/> In 1977 it was invited to compete in the Hasidic Song Festival, an Israeli contest that ran from 1969 to 1984 and that was broadcast on national television.<ref name=mish/> Diaspora was the first yeshiva band to perform in the largely secular music event, and won first prize for its song "''Hu Yiftach Libeinu''" (He will open our hearts).<ref name=mish/> Interviews in the general media followed, increasing name recognition and visitors to the Saturday-night concerts.<ref name=mish/> The band was invited back for the 1978 Hasidic Song Festival, and won first prize for its song "''Malchutcha''" (Your sovereignty).<ref name=mish/>
