The '''Yugoslav coup d'<U+00E9>tat''' occurred on 27 March 1941 in [[Belgrade]], [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]. The coup was planned and conducted by a group of pro-Western [[Serbs|Serb]]-nationalist [[Royal Yugoslav Air Force]] officers formally led by Air Force General [[Du<U+0161>an Simovi<U+0107>]], who had been associated with a number of coup plots from 1938 onwards. For practical purposes Brigadier General of Military Aviation [[Borivoje Mirkovi<U+0107>]], Major [[<U+017D>ivan Kne<U+017E>evi<U+0107>]] of the Yugoslav [[Royal Guard]]s, and his brother [[Radoje Kne<U+017E>evi<U+0107>]] all performed leadership roles in the conduct of the coup. In addition to Radoje Kne<U+017E>evi<U+0107>, some other civilian leaders were probably aware of the coup before it was launched and moved to support it once it occurred, but they were not among the organisers. The [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia|Communist Party of Yugoslavia]] played no part in the coup, although it made a significant contribution to the mass street protests in many cities that signalled popular support for the coup after it occurred. The coup was successful and overthrew the three-member regency: [[Prince Paul of Yugoslavia|Prince Paul]], Dr. [[Radenko Stankovi<U+0107>]] and Dr. [[Ivo Perovi<U+0107>]], as well as the government of Prime Minister [[Dragi<U+0161>a Cvetkovi<U+0107>]]. Two days before the coup, the Cvetkovi<U+0107> government had signed the [[Vienna]] Protocol on the Accession of Yugoslavia to the [[Tripartite Pact]] (Axis). The coup had been planned for several months, but the signing of the Tripartite Pact spurred the organisers to carry it out, encouraged by the British [[Special Operations Executive]]. 
 
The military conspirators brought to power the 17-year-old King [[Peter II of Yugoslavia|Peter II Kara<U+0111>or<U+0111>evi<U+0107>]], who they declared to be of age to assume the throne, and a government of national unity was formed with Simovi<U+0107> as prime minister and [[Vladko Ma<U+010D>ek]] and [[Slobodan Jovanovi<U+0107>]] as his vice-premiers. The coup resulted in the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]].

==Background==

From the moment of its creation, the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] was politically weak and remained so during the [[interwar period]] mainly due to a "rigid system of centralism",{{sfn|Tomasevich|1969|p=60}} the strong association between each national group and its dominant religion,{{sfn|Tomasevich|1969|pp=61<U+2013>62}} and uneven economic development.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1969|p=62}} In particular, the religious primacy of the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] in national affairs and discrimination against [[Roman Catholic]]s and [[Muslim]]s compounded the dissatisfaction of the non-[[Serbs|Serb]] population with the Serb-dominated ruling groups that treated non-Serbs as second-class citizens.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1969|pp=61<U+2013>62}} This centralised system was created through political bribery and until 1929 it was maintained by subverting the democratic system of government. The domination of the rest of Yugoslavia by Serb ruling elites meant that the country was never consolidated in the political sense, and was therefore never able to address the social and economic challenges it faced.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1969|p=61}} According to the political scientist Professor Sabrina Ramet, the dysfunctionality and lack of legitimacy of the regime meant that politics became ethnically polarised, a phenomena that has been referred to as the "national question" in Yugoslavia. Failures to establish the rule of law, to protect individual rights, to build tolerance and equality, and to guarantee the neutrality of the state in matters relating to religion, language and culture contributed to this illegitimacy and the resulting instability.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=76}} In 1929 democracy was abandoned and a [[6 January Dictatorship|royal dictatorship]] was established by [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|King Alexander]],{{sfn|Tomasevich|1969|p=61}} who attempted to breakdown the ethnic divisions in the country through a number of means, including creating administrative divisions ({{lang-sh|banovina}}) based on rivers rather than traditional regions.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|pp=79<U+2013>80}} There was significant opposition to this move, with Serb and Slovenian opposition parties and figures advocating the division of Yugoslavia into six ethnically-based  administrative units. By 1933, discontent in the [[Sava Banovina]] had developed into full-blown civil disorder, which the regime countered with a series of assassinations, attempted assassinations and arrests of key Croatian opposition figures including the leader of the [[Croatian Peasant Party]] (Hrvatska selja<U+010D>ka stranka, HSS) [[Vladko Ma<U+010D>ek]].{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=87}} When Alexander was assassinated in Marseilles in 1934, his cousin [[Prince Paul of Yugoslavia|Prince Paul]] headed a [[triumvirate]] [[Regency (government)|regency]] whose other members were the senator Dr. [[Radenko Stankovi<U+0107>]] and the governor of the Sava Banovina, Dr. Ivo Perovi<U+0107>. The regency ruled on behalf of Alexander's 11 year old son, [[Peter II of Yugoslavia|Prince Peter]], but the important member of the regency was Prince Paul.{{sfn|Dragnich|1983|p=99}} Although Prince Paul was more liberal than his cousin, the dictatorship continued uninterrupted.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1969|pp=60<U+2013>63}}

Prince Paul recognised the lack of national solidarity and political weakness of his country, and after he assumed power he made repeated attempts to negotiate a political settlement with Ma<U+010D>ek, the leader of the dominant Croat political party in Yugoslavia, the HSS. In January 1937, Prime Minister [[Milan Stojadinovi<U+0107>]] met with Ma<U+010D>ek at Prince Paul's request, but Stojadinovi<U+0107> was unwilling or unable to grapple with the issue of Croat dissatisfaction with a Yugoslavia dominated by the Serb ruling class.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|pp=22<U+2013>23}} In 1938, the ''[[Anschluss]]'' brought [[Nazi Germany]] to the borders of Yugoslavia,{{sfn|Roberts|1987|p=7}} and early elections were held in December. In this background, Simovi<U+0107> had been involved in two coup plots in early 1938 driven by Serb opposition to the ''Concordat'' with the [[Holy See|Vatican]], and another coup plot following the December election.{{sfn|Onslow|2005|p=37}} In the December 1938 elections, the [[United Opposition (Yugoslavia)|United Opposition]] led by Ma<U+010D>ek had attracted 44.9 per cent of the vote,{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=40}} but due to the electoral rules by which the government parties received 40 per cent of the seats in the National Assembly before votes were counted, the opposition vote only translated into 67 seats out of a total of 373.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=104}} On 3 February 1939 minister of education Bogoljub Kujund<U+017E>i<U+0107> made a nationalist speech in the Assembly in which he stated that "Serb policies will always be the policies of this house and this government".{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=105}}{{sfn|Malcolm|1994|p=171}} Minister and head of the [[Yugoslav Muslim Organization]] (JMO) [[Mehmed Spaho]] asked Stojadinovi<U+0107> to disavow the statement, but he did not. The same evening Spaho, [[D<U+017E>afer Kulenovi<U+0107>]], [[Anton Koro<U+0161>ec]], Franc Snoj, and [[Dragi<U+0161>a Cvetkovi<U+0107>]] resigned from the government.{{sfn|Singleton|1985|p=170}} Stojadinovi<U+0107> sought authority from Prince Paul to form a new cabinet, however Koro<U+0161>ec as head of the Senate advised the prince to form a new government around Cvetkovi<U+0107>. Prince Paul dismissed Stojadinovi<U+0107> and appointed Cvetkovi<U+0107> in his place, with a direction that he reach an agreement with Ma<U+010D>ek.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=23}} While these negotiations were ongoing, [[Italian invasion of Albania|Italy invaded Albania]]. In August 1939 the [[Cvetkovi<U+0107><U+2013>Ma<U+010D>ek Agreement]] was concluded to create the [[Banovina of Croatia]], which was to be a relatively autonomous political unit within Yugoslavia. Separatist Croats considered the Agreement did not go far enough, and many Serbs believed it went too far in giving power to Croats.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=24}} The Cvetkovi<U+0107>-led cabinet formed in the wake of the Agreement was resolutely anti-Axis,{{sfn|Stari<U+010D>|2005|p=35}} and included five members of the HSS, with Ma<U+010D>ek as deputy prime minister and [[General of the Army|General]] [[Milan Nedi<U+0107>]] as [[Ministry of Defense (Yugoslavia)|Minister of the Army and Navy]].{{sfn|Ramet|2006|pp=106<U+2013>107}} After the outbreak of [[World War II]] in September 1939, German pressure on the government resulted in the resignation in mid-1940 of the [[Ministry of the Interior (Yugoslavia)|Minister of the Interior]], Dr. Stanoje Mihald<U+017E>i<U+0107> who had been organising covert anti-Axis activities.{{sfn|Stari<U+010D>|2005|p=35}} In October 1940, Simovi<U+0107> was again approached by plotters planning a coup but he was non-committal.{{sfn|Onslow|2005|p=37}} From the outbreak of war British diplomacy focused on keeping Yugoslavia neutral, which the Ambassador [[Ronald Ian Campbell|Ronald Campbell]] apparently still believed possible.{{sfn|Stari<U+010D>|2005|p=36}}

===Pressure builds===
By the time of the German [[invasion of Poland]] and subsequent outbreak of war in September 1939, the Yugoslav Intelligence Service was cooperating with British intelligence agencies on a large scale across the country. This cooperation, which had existed to a lesser extent during the early 1930s, intensified after the ''Anschluss'' in 1938. These combined intelligence operations were aimed at strengthening Yugoslavia and keeping her neutral while encouraging covert activities.{{sfn|Stari<U+010D>|2005|p=33}} In mid to late 1940, British intelligence became aware of coup plotting, but managed to side-track the plans, preferring to continue working through Prince Paul.{{sfn|Hehn|2005|pp=368<U+2013>369}}

Yugoslavia's situation worsened in October 1940 when [[Greco-Italian War|Italy invaded Greece]] from [[Albanian Kingdom (1939<U+2013>1943)|Albania]], and the initial failure of the Italians to make headway only increased Yugoslav apprehension that Germany would be forced to help Italy. In September and November 1940 respectively, Germany forced Hungary and Romania to accede to the [[Tripartite Pact]].{{sfn|Roberts|1987|pp=6<U+2013>7}} In early November 1940, General Nedi<U+0107>, who believed that Germany would win the war, proposed to the government that it abandon its neutral stance and join the Axis as soon as possible in the hope that Germany would protect Yugoslavia against its "greedy neighbors".{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=30}} A few days later Prince Paul, having realised the impossibility of following Nedi<U+0107>'s advice, replaced him with the ageing and compliant General [[Petar Pe<U+0161>i<U+0107>]].{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=31}} Over the next few months, Prince Paul and his ministers laboured under overwhelming diplomatic pressure, a threat of an attack by the Germans from Bulgarian territory, and the unwillingness of the British to promise practical military support.{{sfn|Milazzo|1975|p=2}} Six months prior to the coup, British policy towards the government of Yugoslavia had shifted from acceptance of Yugoslav neutrality  to pressuring the country for support in the war against Germany.{{sfn|Stafford|1977|p=401}} On 23 January 1941, [[William J. Donovan|William Donovan]], a special emissary of [[United States]] (US) President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], had visited Belgrade and issued an ultimatum, saying that if Yugoslavia permitted German troop passage then the US would not "interfere on her behalf" at peace talks.{{sfn|Creveld|1973|p=139}} On 14 February, [[Adolf Hitler]] met with Cvetkovi<U+0107> and his foreign minister and requested Yugoslavia's accession to the Tripartite Pact. He pushed for the demobilization of the [[Royal Yugoslav Army]] and the granting of permission to transport German supplies through Yugoslavia's territory, along with greater economic cooperation. In exchange he offered a port near the [[Aegean Sea]] and territorial security.{{sfn|Presseisen|1960|p=367}} On 17 February, [[Bulgaria]] and [[Turkey]] signed an agreement of friendship and non-aggression, which effectively destroyed attempts to create a neutral Balkan bloc. Prince Paul denounced the agreement and the Bulgarians, describing their actions as "perfidy".{{sfn|Presseisen|1960|p=368}} On 18 and 23 February, Prince Paul told US minister [[Arthur Bliss Lane|Arthur Lane]] that Yugoslavia would not engage the German military if they entered Bulgaria. He explained that to do so would be wrongful and that it would not be understood by the Slovenes and Croats.{{sfn|Creveld|1973|p=139}} On 1 March, Yugoslavia was further isolated when Bulgaria signed the Pact and the German army arrived at the Bulgarian-Yugoslav border.{{sfn|Presseisen|1960|p=368}}

On 4 March, Prince Paul secretly met with Hitler in [[Berchtesgaden]] and was again pressured to sign the Pact. Hitler did not request troop passage through Yugoslavia and offered the Greek city of [[Salonika]].{{sfn|Presseisen|1960|p=368}} A time limit for Prince Paul, who was uncommitted and "wavering", wasn't set. Prince Paul, in the middle of cabinet crisis, offered a [[nonaggression pact]] and a declaration of friendship, but Hitler insisted on his proposals.{{sfn|Presseisen|1960|p=368}} Prince Paul warned that "I fear that if I follow your advice and sign the Tripartite Pact I shall no longer be here in six months."{{sfn|Creveld|1973|p=139}} On 8 March, [[Franz Halder]], the German Chief of the [[Oberkommando des Heeres|Army General Staff]], expressed his expectation that the Yugoslavs would sign if German troops did not cross into their border.{{sfn|Presseisen|1960|p=368}}

On 17 March, Prince Paul returned to Berchtesgaden and was told by Hitler that it was his last chance for Yugoslavia to join the Pact, renouncing this time the request for the use of Yugoslav railways in order to facilitate their accession.{{sfn|Presseisen|1960|p=368}} On 19 March, Prince Paul convened a Crown Council to discuss the terms of the Pact and whether Yugoslavia should sign it.{{sfn|Stafford|1977|p=402}} The Council's members were willing to agree, but only under the condition that Germany let its concessions be made public. Germany agreed and the Council approved the terms. Three cabinet ministers resigned on 20 March in protest of the impending signing of the Pact.{{sfn|Presseisen|1960|p=368}} The Germans reacted by imposing an ultimatum to accept by midnight 23 March or forfeit any further chances.{{sfn|Presseisen|1960|pp=368<U+2013>369}} Prince Paul and Cvetkovi<U+0107> obliged and accepted despite believing German promises were "worthless".{{sfn|Presseisen|1960|p=369}} On 23 March, Germany's guarantee of Yugoslavia's territorial security and its promise not to use its railroads were publicized.{{sfn|Presseisen|1960|p=368}} In the [[United Kingdom]], [[Alexander Cadogan]], the [[Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs]], penned in his diary that the "Yugoslavs seem to have sold their souls to the Devil. All these Balkan peoples are trash."{{sfn|Stafford|1977|p=403}}

===Yugoslavia signs the Pact===
On 25 March, the pact was signed at the [[Belvedere, Vienna|Belvedere]] palace in [[Vienna]]. An official banquet was held which Hitler complained felt like a funeral party. German radio later announced that "the Axis Powers would not demand the right of passage of troops or war materials," while the official document mentioned only troops and omitted mention of war materials. Likewise the pledge to give Salonika to Yugoslavia does not appear on the document.{{sfn|Presseisen|1960|p=369}} On the following day, Serb demonstrators gathered on the streets of Belgrade shouting "Better the grave than a slave, better a war than the pact" (''Bolje grob nego rob, Bolje rat nego pakt'').{{sfn|Ramet|Lazi<U+0107>|2011|p=18}}

==Development of the coup==
[[File:PedroIIDeYugoslavia8e00867v.jpg|200px|thumb|Peter II Kara<U+0111>or<U+0111>evi<U+0107>, 17-years-old at the time of coup, was declared to be of age and crowned king.]]
The coup was executed at 2:15&nbsp;am on 27 March.{{sfn|Ramet|Lazi<U+0107>|2011|p=18}} It was planned by a group of [[Yugoslav Royal Air Force]] officers in [[Zemun]], and Royal Guard officers in nearby Belgrade. The only senior officers involved were from the air force.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=43}} Under Mirkovi<U+0107>'s supervision, officers assumed control of critical buildings and locations in the early hours of 27 March, including:{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=46}}
*the Zemun air force base (Colonel Dragutin Savi<U+0107>)
*the bridges over the Sava between Zemun and Belgrade (Colonel Dragutin Dimi<U+0107>)
*the City Administration, Police Directorate and the [[Radio Belgrade|Belgrade radio]] station (Colonel Stjepan Burazovi<U+0107>)
*the ministries and headquarters of the General Staff (Major <U+017D>ivan Kne<U+017E>evi<U+0107>)
*the [[Royal Compound|Royal Court]] (Colonel Stojan Zdravkovi<U+0107>)
*the main post office in Belgrade (Lieutenant Colonel Miodrag Lozi<U+0107>)
*the barracks of the Royal Guards and Automotive Command

Despite British support for the plotters, the initiative came from the Yugoslavs and "only by a stretch of the imagination can the British be said to have planned or directed the coup d'etat."{{sfn|Stafford|1977|p=419}} Individuals that were likely aware of the coup included [[Slobodan Jovanovi<U+0107>]], president of the [[Serbian Cultural Club]], and [[Ilija Trifunovi<U+0107>-Bir<U+010D>anin]], president of [[Narodna Odbrana]] (National Defence).{{sfn|Tomasevich|1969|p=67}}

There are contradictory claims as to who was the leader of the coup and had managed its execution, coming from air force commander, General [[Du<U+0161>an Simovi<U+0107>]], his deputy Brigadier General [[Bora Mirkovi<U+0107>]], and Major [[<U+017D>ivan Kne<U+017E>evi<U+0107>]]. Mirkovi<U+0107> claimed sole credit immediately after the coup and stated on its tenth anniversary that: "Only after I had informed General [Simovi<U+0107>] about my idea and he had accepted it did I make the decision to undertake a the planned revolt. I made the decision myself, and I also carried out the whole organization. I made the decision as to when the revolt would take place." It is likely that he had been a planning a coup since 1937 when an [[Italy-Yugoslavia relations#Later years|Italo-Yugoslav pact]] was signed. King Peter later credited simply the "younger and middle ranks [of officers] of the Yugoslav army" for the coup in a speech on 17 December 1941. Simovi<U+0107>'s response was published posthumously, he claimed that he "stood in the center of the whole undertaking" and "personally engaged his assistant Brigadier General Bora Mirkovi<U+0107> for the action". Mirkovi<U+0107>'s account is the most credible of the two, and is corroborated from several sources, both Allied and Axis.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|pp=44<U+2013>45}} The matter would play a role in the factionalism that would divide the soon-to-be Yugoslav government-in-exile during the war.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=44}}

At the time of the coup, Prince Paul was in [[Zagreb]] en route to a planned holiday in [[Brdo Castle near Kranj|Brdo]].{{sfn|Tanner|1997|p=138}} On the morning of 27 March, Deputy Prime Minister Ma<U+010D>ek was informed of the coup and met Prince Paul at [[Zagreb Central Station|Zagreb's railway station]] to discuss the situation. Ma<U+010D>ek suggested that Paul stay in Zagreb, with the possibility of mobilizing army units in the Banovina of Croatia in his support.{{sfn|Tanner|1997|p=139}} Prince Paul declined this offer, at least partially because his wife [[Princess Olga of Greece and Denmark|Princess Olga]] and children remained in Belgrade. He reached the capital by train that evening and was immediately ordered to sign papers abolishing the regency.{{sfn|Tanner|1997|p=139}} He was subsequently exiled to Greece.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=47}}

On the morning of 27 March, the royal palace was surrounded and the coup's advocates issued a radio message that impersonated the voice of Peter with a "proclamation to the people",{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=47}} calling on them to support the new king.{{sfn|Creveld|1973|p=142}} Pamphlets with the proclamation of the coup were subsequently dropped into cities from airplanes.{{sfn|Dizdar|2007|p=587}} Demonstrations followed in Belgrade and other large Serbian cities that continued for the next few days. Demonstrators frequently used the slogan that was used by demonstrators the day before the coup, "Better the war than the pact, better the grave than a slave".{{sfn|Goldstein|2003|p=268}} [[Winston Churchill]], Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, commented that "Yugoslavia has found its soul<U+201D>.{{sfn|Tanner|1997|p=139}}{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=47}}

The day after the coup Simovi<U+0107> addressed the Serbian Orthodox Church Assembly of Bishops and evoked significant moments in Serbian history such as the [[Battle of Kosovo]] and the [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand]] to justify the coup.{{sfn|Do<U+017E>i<U+0107>|1974|p=417}} For other nations in Yugoslavia, the prospect of war and the government's close ties to the Serbian Orthodox Church was less appealing. On 28 March, Archbishop [[Aloysius Stepinac]], president of the Roman Catholic Conference of Bishops of Yugoslavia, had this to say on the differences in the country:{{sfn|Alexander|1987}}

{{cquote|All in all, Croats and Serbs are of two worlds, north pole and south pole, never will they be able to get together unless by a miracle of God. The Schism is the greatest curse in Europe, almost greater than Protestantism. Here there is no moral, no principles, no truth, no justice, no honesty.}}

==Aftermath==

===The new government===
In the wake of the coup, Simovi<U+0107>'s new government refused to ratify Yugoslavia's signing of the Tripartite Pact, but did not openly rule it out. Hitler, angered by the coup and anti-German incidents in Belgrade, gathered his senior officers and ordered that Yugoslavia be crushed without delay.{{sfn|Milazzo|1975|pp=2<U+2013>3}} On the same day as the coup he issued [[F<U+00FC>hrer Directives|F<U+00FC>hrer Directive]] 25 which called for Yugoslavia to be treated as a hostile state.{{sfn|Trevor-Roper|1964|p=108}} Italy was to be included in the operations and the directive made specific mention that "[e]fforts will be made to induce Hungary and Bulgaria to take part in operations by offering them the prospect of regaining Banat and Macedonia".{{sfn|Trevor-Roper|1964|p=108}} Furthermore, the directive stated that "[i]nternal tensions in Yugoslavia will be encouraged by giving political assurances to the Croats".{{sfn|Trevor-Roper|1964|p=108}}

On 30 March, Foreign Minister [[Mom<U+010D>ilo Nin<U+010D>i<U+0107>]] summoned the German ambassador Viktor von Heeren and handed him a statement which declared that the new government would accept all its international obligations, including accession to the Tripartite Pact, as long as the national interests of the country were protected. Von Heeren returned to his office to discover a message from Berlin instructing that contact with Yugoslav officials was to be avoided, and he was recalled to Berlin. No reply was given to Nin<U+010D>i<U+0107>. On 2 April orders were issued for the evacuation of the German embassy, and the German [[charg<U+00E9> d'affaires]] advised the diplomats of friendly countries to leave the country.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|pp=50<U+2013>51}} 

On 3 April, War Directive 26 was issued, detailing the plan of attack and command structure fornthe invasion. Hungary and Bulgaria were promised the Banat and Macedonia respectively and the Romanian army was explicitly ordered not to take part, holding its position at the countries' border.{{sfn|Trevor-Roper|1964|p=109}} The internal conflict in Hungary over the invasion plans between the army and Prime Minister [[P<U+00E1>l Teleki]] led to Teleki's suicide that same evening. Also on 3 April, [[Edmund Veesenmayer]], representing the Dienststelle Ribbentrop, arrived in Zagreb in preparation for a regime change.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=49}} Croatian pilot [[Vladimir Kren]], a captain in the [[Royal Yugoslav Air Force]], defected to the Germans on 3 April taking with him valuable information about the country's air defenses.{{sfn|Ciglic|Savic|2002|p=10}}

Simovi<U+0107> named Ma<U+010D>ek as Deputy Prime Minister once again in the new government, but Ma<U+010D>ek was reluctant and remained in Zagreb while he decided what to do. While he considered the coup had been an entirely Serbian initiative aimed at both Prince Paul and the Cvetkovi<U+0107><U+2013>Ma<U+010D>ek Agreement, he decided that he needed to show HSS support for the new government and that joining it was necessary.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=47}} On 4 April he travelled to Belgrade and accepted the post,{{sfn|Goldstein|2003|p=268}} on several conditions; that the new government respect the Cvetkovi<U+0107><U+2013>Ma<U+010D>ek Agreement and expand the autonomy of the Banovina Croatia in some respects, that the new government respect the country's accession to the Tripartite Pact, and that one Serb and one Croat temporarily assume the role of regents.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=48}} That same day exiled Croatian politician [[Ante Paveli<U+0107>]] called for Croats to start an uprising against the government over his Radio Velebit program based in Italy.{{sfn|Dizdar|2007|p=588}}  

On 5 April the new cabinet met for the first time. While the first two conditions set by Ma<U+010D>ek were met, the appointment of regents was impracticable given Prince Peter had been declared to be of age. Involving representatives from across the political spectrum, Simovi<U+0107>'s cabinet was "extremely disunited and weak".{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|pp=48<U+2013>49}} It included members who fell into three groups; those who were strongly opposed to the Axis and prepared to face war with Germany, those who advocated peace with Germany, and those that were uncommitted. These groups were as follows:{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=49}}

===Axis invasion===
{{main|Invasion of Yugoslavia}}
The Axis invasion of Yugoslavia began on 6 April. The [[Bombing of Belgrade in World War II|bombing of Belgrade]] forced the government to seek shelter outside the city.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=50}} From here, King Peter and General Simovi<U+0107> planned to leave for exile. Ma<U+010D>ek, refusing to leave the country, resigned on 7 April and designated [[Juraj Krnjevi<U+0107>]] as his successor.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=50}} Ma<U+010D>ek returned to Zagreb. Three other ministers also refused to leave Yugoslavia: [[Ivan Andres]] and [[Bari<U+0161>a Smoljan]] of the HSS and Kulenovi<U+0107> of the JMO.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=50}} The government met on Yugoslav soil for the last time on 13 April near [[Pale, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Pale]]. From here they travelled to [[Nik<U+0161>i<U+0107>]] where they were flown out of the country to Athens.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=19}} 

Another result of the coup was that the work that had been done by British intelligence with the anti-Axis government of Cvetkovi<U+0107> and Ma<U+010D>ek was lost. By supporting the coup plotters, SOE Belgrade undermined the balance in Yugoslav politics that had been achieved by the Cvetkovi<U+0107><U+2013>Ma<U+010D>ek Agreement. Serb nationalists supported and welcomed the coup because it ended Croatian autonomy under the Agreement and freed them to pursue a [[Greater Serbia]] agenda.{{sfn|Stari<U+010D>|2005|p=38}}

===Legacy===
Prince Paul was found guilty of war crimes in September 1945 for his role in the acceptance of the Tripartite Pact. In 2011, a High Court in Serbia found the sentence to be politically and ideologically motivated and Prince Paul was officially rehabilitated.{{sfn|''AFP''|6 October 2012}}{{sfn|''RTS''|15 December 2011}} A similar decision was made in 2009 which rehabilitated Cvetkovi<U+0107> for war crimes charges relating to the signing of the pact.{{sfn|''Politika''|26 September 2009}}
