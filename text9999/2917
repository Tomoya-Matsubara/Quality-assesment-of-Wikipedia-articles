'''State Route 128''' (or SR-128) is a [[state highway]] in the U.S. state of [[Utah]]. The entire length of the highway has been designated the '''Upper Colorado River Scenic Byway''', as part of the [[Utah Scenic Byways]] program. This road also forms part of the [[Dinosaur Diamond Prehistoric Highway]], a [[National Scenic Byway]]. Residents of [[Moab, Utah|Moab]] frequently refer to SR-128 as "the river road",<ref name="rmc">{{cite web

|accessdate = 2008-08-26}}</ref> after the [[Colorado River]], which the highway follows. 

The highway was originally constructed to connect rural cities in eastern Utah with [[Grand Junction, Colorado]], the largest city in the region. The highway was partially merged into the [[State highways in Utah|Utah state highway system]] in 1931, the rest was taken over by the state and assigned route number 128 in 1933. Today, the highway is used as a scenic drive for visitors to the area.<ref name="NG"/>

The highway crosses the Colorado River at the site of the Dewey Bridge, listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. This bridge was the longest suspension bridge in Utah until April 2008 when it was destroyed by a fire started by a child playing with matches.<ref name="freerepublic"/> The future of the bridge is uncertain, with [[Grand County, UT|Grand County]] conducting a study to determine the feasibility of reconstructing it.

==History==
[[Image:Fishertowers2.jpg|thumb|right|The Fisher Towers, spires that tower over Professor Valley, as seen from SR-128]]

Access between Moab and Castle Valley was originally via a [[pack trail]] called the Heavenly Stairway. This trail, named for a dramatic descent of over {{convert|1000|ft|m}}, was described as beautiful, but difficult to navigate.<ref name="grandmemories"/> The Moab area depended on [[Grand Junction, Colorado|Grand Junction]] and other cities in Colorado for both everyday supplies and a market for agricultural products.<ref name="utahdotgov"/>  Moab residents pushed for a road to be built along the riverbank. By 1902, the trail was replaced with a toll road, called King's Toll Road, after Samuel King. King was an early settler who also operated the toll [[ferry]] used prior to the construction of the Dewey Bridge. Rocks inscribed with "Kings Toll Road" can still be found along the roadway. While the road did improve travel, it was not built high enough above the river level and was often flooded.<ref name="grandmemories"/> 

===Dewey Bridge===
The Dewey Bridge, built in 1916, originally carried SR-128 across the Colorado River.<ref name="loc"/> The bridge featured an all wood deck measuring {{convert|502|ft|m|0}} long, {{convert|10.2|ft|m|1}} wide from support to support and {{convert|8|ft|m|1}} wide from rail to rail. The bridge also consisted of two metal towers, a run of seven cables on each side of the bridge deck, and cable anchors.<ref name="grandmemories">{{cite book

[[Image:Deweybridge.jpg|thumb|left|The Dewey Bridge carried SR-128 across the [[Colorado River]] until its retirement in 1988]] 
In 1912 [[Grand County, Utah|Grand County]] unsuccessfully petitioned the state to finance the construction of a bridge. In 1913, the ferry was out of service for a time because ice in the river struck the ferry, causing it to sink. This raised the level of urgency for a more reliable river crossing. Grand County held a [[municipal bond]] election, and was able to raise $25,000<ref name=loc/> (1913, $550,000 in 2008)<ref name="inflation calculator">{{cite web

|accessdate = 2008-08-29}}</ref> to finance the construction of a bridge. The county employed the Midland Bridge Company of [[Kansas City, Missouri]] to build it. Plans originally called for the bridge deck to be {{convert|12|ft|m|1}} wide, but with the bonds not producing the expected yields, the deck width was scaled down to {{convert|8|ft|m|1}}. In 1916, the bridge was dedicated with a strength test by having approximately 70 attendees attempt cross the bridge at once. The total was seven wagons, two people on horseback and several on foot.<ref name="loc"/> The bridge was designed to support the weight of six horses, three wagons, and {{convert|9000|lb|kg|sigfig=2}} of freight.<ref name="utahdotgov">{{cite web

On the day of its completion, it was the second-longest [[suspension bridge]] west of the [[Mississippi River]]. The longest was also built by the Midland Bridge Company, who used the same base plans for both bridges. The longer twin to the Dewey Bridge crossed the [[Little Colorado River]] along [[U.S. Route 89 (Arizona)|U.S. Route 89]] in [[Cameron, Arizona]]. The Dewey Bridge remained the longest suspension bridge in Utah until it was destroyed by fire in 2008.<ref name="loc">{{cite web

As part of a tribute, a reporter for the [[The Daily Sentinel (Colorado)|The Daily Sentinel]] interviewed locals and visitors about their first experience crossing the bridge. Many recalled how nervous they felt as the bridge would creak and sway under load. One stated, "A lot of people lost a lot of mirrors on that bridge".<ref name="freerepublic">{{cite news

An agreement was reached in 1984 between the Grand County Commission and the [[Utah Department of Transportation]] (UDOT) to balance the conflicting public demands to retire and preserve the aging bridge. As part of this agreement, UDOT would commission a new bridge and once finished, transfer ownership of the original bridge back to Grand County. Grand County agreed to petition to have the bridge be included in the [[National Register of Historic Places]], assume maintenance and guarantee the bridge would be preserved.<ref name="resolutions-128">[[Utah Department of Transportation]], [http://www.udot.utah.gov/main/f?p=100:pg:5285268476414239680:::1:T,V:1348, Highway Resolutions]: {{PDFlink|1=[http://www.udot.utah.gov/main/uconowner.gf?n=200609181325161 Route 128]|2=766&nbsp;KB}}, (November 2007), Retrieved on [[2008-05-15]]</ref> The nomination was approved and the bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places on July 12, 1984.<ref name="NPS.gov">{{cite web

Though the Colorado River runs for over {{convert|400|mi|km}} in Utah, the Dewey Bridge is one of only three bridges in that state that cross it. The other two are an un-named bridge that carries [[U.S. Route 191 (Utah)|US-191]] (built in 1911, replaced in 1955) and the Hite Crossing Bridge (built in 1966) used by [[Utah State Route 95|SR-95]].<ref name="grandmemories"/>

===From trail to highway===
[[Image:UTSR128.JPG|thumb|right|SR-128 approaching Drinks Canyon]]
With the bridge finished in 1916, by the 1920s the toll road was reconstructed above the [[ordinary high water mark]] so the road could be used year-round.<ref name="grandmemories" /> The road was briefly used for the route of the [[Midland Trail]] across eastern Utah. However, by 1923 the trail had been moved to a more direct routing, similar to modern [[Interstate 70 in Utah|I-70]].<ref name="grandvalleytimes">{{cite news

The state legislature extended SR-128 about {{convert|3|mi|km|0}} at its east end in 1969, due to the pending construction of I-70. Plans called for the freeway to bypass the Cisco area, including the terminus of SR-128. The legislature transferred a portion of [[Utah State Route 4 (1962-1977)|SR-4]] (the legislative designation for what was then signed [[US-6 (UT)|US-6]]/[[US-50 (UT)|US-50]]) near Cisco to the proposed junction with I-70.
