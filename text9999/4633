'''Providence Chapel''' is a former [[Reformed Baptists|Calvinistic Baptist]] place of worship in the village of [[Hadlow Down]] in [[Wealden]], one of six [[Districts of England|local government districts]] in the English county of [[East Sussex]].  Although built in 1849, the chapel can trace its origins to the founding in 1824 of an Independent Baptist place of worship in the village (pre-dating the local [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] church by 12 years).  The new building was in religious use for nearly 150 years, but storm damage led to its closure and conversion into [[Apartment|flats]] in 1993<U+2014>although its former graveyard survives.  The chapel is a Grade II [[Listed building]].

==History==
The village of Hadlow Down is situated on high ground in the Sussex [[Weald]] between [[Buxted]] ({{convert|2.75|mi|km|sigfig=2}} to the west) and [[Heathfield, East Sussex|Heathfield]].<ref name="Pevsner513">{{Harvnb|Nairn|Pevsner|1965|p=513.}}</ref><ref name="HDO-About">{{Cite web|url=http://www.hadlowdown.com/Default.aspx?tabid=99|title=About Hadlow Down: The Village at the Heart of the Sussex Weald|year=2007|work=Hadlow Down Online|publisher=Propel Systems Ltd|accessdate=21 April 2010}}</ref>  Its first Anglican church, [[St Mark's Church, Hadlow Down|dedicated to St Mark]], was built in 1836,<ref name="Pevsner513"/> and a parish was created from parts of Buxted and [[Mayfield and Five Ashes|Mayfield]] parishes the following year.<ref name="Kelly">{{Cite book|last=Kelly|first=E.R.|title=Kelly's Directory of Sussex|publisher=Kelly & Co|location=London|year=1882|url=http://www.hadlowdown.com/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=j3rSlDERPTY%3d&tabid=232&mid=744}}</ref>  The first place of worship in the village was, however, founded 12 years earlier.  In 1824, Henry Smith<U+2014>a local builder and [[Wesleyanism|Wesleyan Methodist]]<U+2014>built an independent [[Nonconformism|nonconformist]] chapel for the use of local [[Dissenter]]s, principally Baptists.<ref name="HDO-Places">{{Cite web|url=http://www.hadlowdown.com/Default.aspx?tabid=224|title=Notable Village Places|year=2007|work=Hadlow Down Online|publisher=Propel Systems Ltd|accessdate=21 April 2010}}</ref><ref name="PoW26">{{Harvnb|Elleray|2004|p=26.}}</ref>  In 1849, it was replaced by the present building.

The chapel was still used for worship until the late 20th century, but it was severely damaged in the devastating [[Great Storm of 1987]].  It closed soon after this<ref name="Stell341">{{Harvnb|Stell|2002|p=341.}}</ref> and was converted into a house in 1996.<ref name="PoW26"/>

Providence Chapel was designated a Grade II [[Listed building]] on 31 December 1982.<ref name="IoE296231">{{Cite web|url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/Details/Default.aspx?id=296231&mode=quick|title=Detailed Record: The Providence Chapel, Hadlow Down, Wealden, East Sussex|year=2007|work=[[Images of England]]|publisher=[[English Heritage]]|accessdate=21 April 2010}}</ref>
