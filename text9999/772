The '''Sonestown Covered Bridge''' is a [[Burr Truss|Burr arch truss]] [[covered bridge]] over [[Muncy Creek]] in [[Davidson Township, Pennsylvania|Davidson Township]], [[Sullivan County, Pennsylvania|Sullivan County]], in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Pennsylvania]]. Built ''circa'' 1850, the bridge is {{convert|110|ft}} long, and was placed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] (NRHP) in 1980.<ref name="arch">{{cite web

}}</ref> The bridge is named for the nearby [[unincorporated area|unincorporated]] [[village]] of Sonestown in Davidson Township, and is also known as the Davidson Covered Bridge. It was built to provide access to a [[gristmill]], which operated until the early 20th&nbsp;century.

Pennsylvania had the first covered bridge in the United States and the most such bridges in the 19th, 20th, and 21st&nbsp;centuries. In most places in the state they were a transition between stone and metal bridges, with the roof and sides protecting the wooden structure from weather. The Sonestown bridge is a Burr arch truss type, with a [[Structural engineering|load-bearing]] [[arch]] sandwiching multiple vertical [[Truss#King_post_truss|king posts]], for strength and rigidity. The bridge construction is cruder than the other two surviving covered bridges in Sullivan County, with each Burr arch formed from six straight beams set at angles instead of a smooth curve.

The bridge was repaired ''circa'' 1969, and after flood damage in 1996&nbsp;and 2005. It was also restored in 2001. Despite the repairs and restoration, as of 2006&nbsp;the bridge structure's sufficiency rating on the [[National Bridge Inventory]] was only 18.6&nbsp;percent and its condition was deemed "basically intolerable requiring high priority of corrective action".<ref name="national bridges"/> It is the shortest covered bridge in the county and is still in use, with average daily traffic of 50&nbsp;vehicles in 2006.

==History==
===Background===
The first covered bridge in the United States was built in 1800&nbsp;over the [[Schuylkill River]] in Philadelphia. According to Susan M. Zacher, author of ''The Covered Bridges of Pennsylvania: A Guide'', the first covered bridges of the Burr arch truss design were also built in the state. Pennsylvania is estimated to have once had at least 1,500&nbsp;covered bridges and is believed to have had the most in the country between 1830&nbsp;and 1875.<ref name = "three counties">{{cite web | url = http://www.nr.nps.gov/multiples/64000708.pdf | title = National Register of Historic Places Inventory Nomination Form: Covered Bridges of Bradford, Sullivan and Lycoming Counties | accessdate = 2008-04-14 | author = Susan M. Zacher, Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission | format = PDF }}</ref> In 2001, Pennsylvania had more surviving historic covered bridges than any other state, with 221&nbsp;remaining in 40&nbsp;of its 67&nbsp;counties.<ref name = "evans intro">{{cite book |title = Pennsylvania's Covered Bridges: A Complete Guide |first = Benjamin D. |last = Evans |coauthors = Evans, June R. | publisher = University of Pittsburgh Press |location = Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania | isbn = 0-8229-5764-7 |date = 2001 |edition =2nd | pages = 2, 7, 12}}</ref> 

[[Image:Sonestown Covered Bridge 16.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The south side and east portal of the bridge and site of the former mill in December 2008]]
Covered bridges were a transition between stone and metal bridges, the latter made of cast-iron or steel. In 19th-century Pennsylvania, lumber was an abundant resource for bridge construction,<ref name = "three counties"/> but wood did not last long when exposed to the elements. The roof and enclosed sides of covered bridges protected the structural elements, allowing some of these bridges to survive for well over a century. A Burr arch truss consists of a [[Structural engineering|load-bearing]] [[arch]] sandwiching multiple [[Truss#King_post_truss|king posts]], resulting in a stronger and more rigid structure than one made of either element alone.<ref name = "evans intro"/> Although there were 30&nbsp;covered bridges in Sullivan County in 1890, only five were left by 1954, and as of 2008&nbsp;only three remain: [[Forksville Covered Bridge|Forksville]], [[Hillsgrove Covered Bridge|Hillsgrove]], and Sonestown.<ref name = "arch"/><ref name = "evans 3">{{cite book |title = Pennsylvania's Covered Bridges: A Complete Guide |first = Benjamin D. |last = Evans |coauthors = Evans, June R. | publisher = University of Pittsburgh Press |location = Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania | isbn = 0-8229-5764-7 |date = 2001 |edition =2nd | pages = 257&ndash;259}}</ref>

All three Sullivan County covered bridges were built in or ''circa'' 1850&nbsp;with Burr arch trusses.<ref name = "arch"/><ref name = "evans 3"/> At the time of its construction, the Sonestown bridge was the fifth covered bridge in Sullivan County.<ref name = "reopen"/> The bridge crossed [[Muncy Creek]] to provide access to Johnny Hazen's gristmill,<ref name="zacher"/> which was also built in 1850.<ref name="sullivan history"/> Although sources do not list the builder of the Sonestown bridge, a 1997&nbsp;newspaper article on the remaining Sullivan County covered bridges reported that Sadler Rodgers had designed it.<ref name="three">{{cite news |first= Mollie |last= Eliot |title= Sullivan County's Covered Bridges Survive But Their Numbers Are Down From 30&nbsp;to Three Today |publisher= ''Williamsport Sun-Gazette'' |date= 1997-12-28 }}</ref> Rogers, a native of [[Forksville, Pennsylvania|Forksville]], built both the Forksville and Hillsgrove bridges in 1850, when he was 18&nbsp;years old.<ref name = "industry">{{cite book | title = Sullivan County Industries: Now and Then | date = 1954 | publisher = The Endicott Printing Company |location = Endicott, New York |url = http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~pasulliv/SullivanCountyHistoricalSociety/SullivanIndustries.htm |accessdate = 2008-09-08}}</ref>

On July 24, 1980, the Sonestown bridge was listed on the NRHP in a [[National_Register_of_Historic_Places#Multiple_Property_Submission|Multiple Property Submission]] of seven [[Covered Bridges of Bradford, Sullivan and Lycoming Counties]].<ref name = "three counties"/> The Sonestown bridge is also on the 2006&nbsp;National Bridge Inventory (NBI), which lists the covered bridge as {{convert|110|ft}} long, with a roadway {{convert|13|ft|6|in}} wide, and a maximum load of {{convert|5.0|ST|MT|lk=on}}.<ref name="national bridges"/> However, the maximum load posted beside the bridge itself is only {{convert|3.0|ST|MT}}. According to the NRHP, the bridge's "road surface width" is {{convert|15|ft}},<ref name="arch"/> which is only sufficient for a single lane of traffic.<ref name="national bridges"/> 

[[Image:Sonestown Covered Bridge 7.jpg|thumb|left|Bridge interior showing the angular Burr arches, with the arch on the left (north side) taller than that on the right (south side).]]
According to the NRHP form, the Sonestown bridge "is of lighter construction than similar bridges in south-eastern Pennsylvania".<ref name = "arch"/> The covered bridge rests on [[abutment]]s of stone and mortar, which have been reinforced with concrete. The portals are flanked by wing walls below the level of the road;<ref name= "evans"/> these extend out from the abutments at an angle and "retain the soil of the approach embankment".<ref>{{cite web| author = Pierce, Phillip C.; Brungraber, Robert L.; Lichtenstein, Abba; Sabol, Scott; Morrell, J.J.; Lebow, S.T. | url = http://www.tfhrc.gov/structur/pubs/04098/04098.pdf |format = PDF | title = "Covered Bridge Manual: Publication No. FHWA-HRT-04-098" | date = April 2005 | publisher = [[United States Department of Transportation|US Department of Transportation]], [[Federal Highway Administration]], Turner-Fairbank Highway Research Center | accessdate = 2008-06-26 | page = 80}} ''Note'': See page 80 and Figure 69 for more information on wing walls.</ref>

The bridge deck is made of wide boards laid perpendicular to the axis of the bridge, with two runners on top of the deck which run the length of the bridge.<ref name = "evans"/><ref name = "zacher"/> The Burr arches which support the bridge are cruder than those in the other two Sullivan County covered bridges; they are not smooth "continuous arcs, but several straight segments joined at an angle".<ref name = "arch"/><ref name = "evans"/> The top of the Burr arch on the south (downstream) side of the bridge is noticeably lower than the top of the arch on the north (upstream) side.<ref>Note: Follow this link for a [[:Image:Sonestown Covered Bridge 7.jpg|photograph of the interior of the bridge]] with the south (downstream) side of the bridge on the right.</ref> 

Vertical boards cover the sides and portals of the bridge and are painted red.<ref name = "evans"/> The bridge has no windows but does have openings between the [[eave]]s and the siding which run the length of the bridge on both sides. The gable roof is covered with wooden [[Shake (shingle)|shake shingles]]. A sign listing the vertical clearance as {{convert|10|ft|0|in}} is posted above each portal. The bridge has no steel reinforcements.<ref name = "evans"/><ref name = "zacher"/> 

Attitudes towards covered bridges in Sullivan County changed considerably in the last half of the 20th&nbsp;century. Two of the five bridges that remained in 1954&nbsp;were razed by 1970, when the [[Pennsylvania Department of Transportation]] considered tearing down the Forksville bridge (but renovated it because of its historic nature and appeal to tourists).<ref name="grit">{{cite news |title= Covered Bridge at Forksville Being Renovated: Old Covered Bridge Just 'Oozing' History |publisher= ''Grit'' (City News Edition) |date= 1970-09-13 }}</ref>  The Hillsgrove Covered Bridge was added to the NRHP in 1973, and the two other bridges were added in 1980. The Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission requires its approval for renovation work on NRHP bridges in the state, and forbids the destruction of these bridges.<ref name = "phmc">{{cite news |first= Nancy E. |last= Baumgartner |title= Cogan House Covered Bridge Dedication Follows Facelift |publisher= ''[[Williamsport Sun-Gazette]]'' |date= 1998-11-01 }} </ref>

===Use and restoration===
[[Image:Sonestown Covered Bridge 13.jpg|thumb|right|Underside of the bridge, with riprap (large rocks) protecting the west abutment]]
In the 19th&nbsp;century the Sonestown Covered Bridge survived major floods on March&nbsp;1, 1865 and June&nbsp;1, 1889, that destroyed other bridges in the West Branch Susquehanna River valley. The latter flood was caused by the same storm system that caused the [[Johnstown Flood]], which killed over 2,200&nbsp;people.<ref name="history 1">

Erosion in September 2004&nbsp;had destroyed a house {{convert|200|ft}} upstream of the bridge, so the Sullivan County Commissioners planned additional work to stabilize the creek bed and prevent further erosion damage. The work, on private property and requiring permission from the [[Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection]],<ref>{{cite news |first= James |last= Loewenstein |title= Sonestown Covered Bridge threatened by erosion |work= Towanda Daily Review |date= 2005-07-05 | url = http://www.thedailyreview.com/articles/2005/07/05/import/20050705-archive5.txt}}</ref>  was done in the summer of 2006.

The NRHP form describes the bridge's condition as "fair" in 1969&nbsp;and "good" in 1980.<ref name = "arch"/> Zacher's 1994&nbsp;book and the Evans 2001&nbsp;book also listed it as in "good" condition.<ref name = "evans"/><ref name = "zacher"/> Despite this and the repairs and restoration, the 2006&nbsp;[[Federal Highway Administration]] [[National Bridge Inventory]] found the sufficiency rating of the bridge structure to be only 18.6&nbsp;percent.{{Ref_label|A|a|none}} It found that the bridge's foundations were stable for scour conditions (the potential for the stream washing them out), but that the railing "does not meet currently acceptable standards".<ref name="national bridges"/> Its overall condition was deemed "basically intolerable requiring high priority of corrective action", with an estimated cost to improve the bridge of $108,000.<ref name="national bridges"/>

In 1996 there was a tradition of decorating and lighting the Sonestown bridge for Christmas.<ref name = "three"/> The average daily traffic on the bridge was 50&nbsp;vehicles in 2006.<ref name="national bridges"/> As of 2008, it was still used and was the only remaining covered bridge over Muncy Creek, although the Muncy Creek [[drainage basin|watershed]] also had the [[Lairdsville Covered Bridge]], which spanned [[Little Muncy Creek]] in Lycoming County.<ref name = "three counties"/> According to Zacher, the "Sullivan County bridges, because of their settings, are some of the most attractive in the state".<ref name="zacher"/>

The following table is a comparison of published measurements of length, width and load recorded in different sources using different methods, as well as the name or names cited. The NBI measures bridge length between the "backwalls of abutments" or the pavement grooves at the opposite ends of the bridge.<ref name="national bridges"/> It defines the roadway width as "the most restrictive minimum distance between curbs or rails".<ref name="national bridges"/> The NRHP form was prepared by the [[Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission]] (PHMC), which surveyed county engineers, historical and covered bridge societies, and others for all the covered bridges in the commonwealth.<ref name = "arch"/><ref name = "three counties"/> The Evans visited every covered bridge in Pennsylvania in 2001&nbsp;and measured each bridge's length (portal to portal) and  width (at the portal) for their book.<ref name = "evans intro"/> The data in Zacher's book was based on a 1991&nbsp;survey of all covered bridges in Pennsylvania by the PHMC and the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, aided by local government and private agencies.<ref name = "zacher"/> The article uses primarily the NBI and NRHP data, as they are national programs.
