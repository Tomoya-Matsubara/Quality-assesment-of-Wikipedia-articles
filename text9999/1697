'''Hon<U+00F3>rio Hermeto Carneiro Le<U+00E3>o''', the '''Marquis of Paran<U+00E1>''' (11 January 1801 <U+2013> 3 September 1856) was a [[Brazilian people|Brazilian]] statesman, diplomat, judge and monarchist during the period of the [[Brazilian Empire|Empire of Brazil]] (1822<U+2013>1889). As co-founder of the Brazilian [[Conservative Party (Brazil)|Conservative Party]],<ref name="Barman 1999, p.162">[[#refBarman1999|Barman (1999)]], p. 162.</ref> he championed [[liberalism]], [[exceptionalism]], state authority and a representative, parliamentary monarchy.<ref>[[#refNeedell2005|Needell (2006)]], p. 75.</ref> Paran<U+00E1> had been schooled in his party's principles by Bernardo Pereira de Vasconcelos, who was renowned for his intellectual capacity and leadership.<ref name="Barman 1999, p.59"/>

Paran<U+00E1> was born to a humble family in [[Jacu<U+00ED>|S<U+00E3>o Carlos do Jacu<U+00ED>]], in what was then the [[captaincy]] of [[Minas Gerais]]. After attending the [[University of Coimbra]] in Portugal, Paran<U+00E1> was appointed a judge in 1826 and later elevated to [[appellate court]] justice. In 1830, he was elected to represent Minas Gerais in the [[Chamber of Deputies of Brazil|Chamber of Deputies]]; he was reelected in 1834 and 1838, and would ultimately hold the post for ten years. His natural leadership skills made him one of the most influential politicians in the country. In the aftermath of [[Pedro I of Brazil|Pedro I]]'s abdication in 1831, a regency created to govern Brazil during the minority of the Emperor's son, [[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro II]], soon dissolved into chaos. Paran<U+00E1> and his party's stalwart and unconditional defense of constitutional order allowed the country to move beyond a regency plagued with factious disputes and rebellions, which might easily have led the nation into dictatorship or dismemberment.

Appointed president of [[Rio de Janeiro]] province in 1841, Paran<U+00E1> helped put down a rebellion headed by the opposition [[Liberal Party]] in the following year. Also in 1842, he was elected senator for Minas Gerais and appointed by Pedro II to the [[Privy Council|Council of State]]. In 1843, he became the ''de facto'' first [[President of the Council of Ministers of Brazil]], while concurrently serving as Minister of Justice (a position he had briefly held in 1833), but lost the office after a quarrel with the Emperor.

After years in the opposition, in 1849, Paran<U+00E1> was appointed by the national government as president of [[Pernambuco]] province to investigate a [[Praieira revolt|Liberal rebellion]] that had taken place a year earlier and urge that the rebels receive a fair trial. With the nation internally pacified, he was sent to [[Uruguay]] in 1851 to forge an alliance between Brazil and that country, as well as with the rebel Argentine provinces of [[Corrientes Province|Corrientes]] and [[Entre R<U+00ED>os Province|Entre R<U+00ED>os]], against the [[Argentine Confederation]] headed by dictator [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]]. In 1853, Paran<U+00E1> was appointed president of the Council of Ministers and headed a highly successful Cabinet credited with ushering in several vital reforms. On 3 September 1856, while still in office, he died unexpectedly of an unknown febrile condition. To this day, he is regarded as one of the most influential politicians of his time and one of the greatest statesmen in the history of Brazil.<ref name="Vainfas, p.343">[[#refVainfas2002|Vainfas (2002)]], p. 343.</ref>

==Early years==

Hon<U+00F3>rio Hermeto Carneiro Le<U+00E3>o was born on 11 January 1801, in the ''[[freguesia]]'' ([[civil parish]]) of [[Jacu<U+00ED>|S<U+00E3>o Carlos do Jacu<U+00ED>]], in what was then the [[captaincy]] of Minas Gerais, to Antonio Neto Carneiro Le<U+00E3>o and Joana Severina Augusta de Lemos.<ref name="Janotti, p.17">[[#refJanotti2004|Janotti (1990)]], p. 17.</ref><ref>[[#refSisson1999|Sisson (1999)]], p. 21.</ref><ref name="Dias, p.414">[[#refDias1969|Dias (1969)]], p. 414.</ref> He was named after [[Saint Honorina]].<ref name="Gouveia, p.17">[[#refGouveia1962|Gouveia (1962)]], p. 17.</ref> On his father's side, he was descended from Portugal's powerful Carneiro Le<U+00E3>o clan,<ref name="Janotti, p.17"/> which had settled in Brazil in the 17th century.<ref name="Carvalho 2002, p.14">[[#refCarvalho2002|Carvalho (2002)]], p. 14.</ref> Antonio Neto was a military officer from one of the family's less prosperous branches; in 1801 he held the rank of ''furriel'' (3rd Sergeant).<ref name="Janotti, p.17"/><ref name="Dias, p.414"/><ref name="Gouveia, p.17"/><ref name="Carvalho 2002, p.14"/><ref name="Salles, p.61">[[#refSalles1996|Salles (1996)]], p. 61.</ref> He was widowed on 10 November 1806, and on 11 January 1807 wed Rita de C<U+00E1>ssia Soares do Couto, the daughter of his late wife's sister.<ref name="Janotti, p.17"/><ref name="Gouveia, p.18">[[#refGouveia1962|Gouveia (1962)]], p. 18.</ref>

Little is known of Carneiro Le<U+00E3>o's early years. He first lived in [[Paracatu, Minas Gerais|Paracat<U+00FA>]] then moved to Vila Rica (now [[Ouro Preto]]), the capital of Minas Gerais at the time, where he spent his childhood and adolescence.<ref name="Janotti, p.17"/><ref name="Gouveia, p.18"/> He was raised by Colonel Nicolau Soares Couto, his stepmother's father.<ref name="Gouveia, p.18"/> Carneiro Le<U+00E3>o had a younger sister, Balbina Hon<U+00F3>ria,<ref name="Gouveia, p.18"/> and a brother from his father's second marriage named Nicolau Neto Carneiro Le<U+00E3>o (later baron of Santa Maria).<ref>[[#refNeedell2005|Needell (2006)]], p. 329.</ref> His father made great efforts to provide him with an education of much higher quality than would normally be expected in a family of their limited financial means.<ref name="Janotti, p.17"/><ref name="Dias, p.414">[[#refDias1969|Dias (1969)]], p. 414.</ref><ref name="Salles, p.61"/> At age 16, Carneiro Le<U+00E3>o was commissioned as a lieutenant and [[standard-bearer]] of the 2nd Militia Cavalry Regiment, 1st Company, in Vila Rica.<ref>[[#refJanotti2004|Janotti (1990)]], pp. 17-18.</ref>

His father was promoted to captain in 1819, increasing his income and making it possible for Carneiro Le<U+00E3>o to go to Portugal and enroll in the [[University of Coimbra]]'s law school in 1820.<ref>[[#refJanotti2004|Janotti (1990)]], p. 18.</ref> Carneiro Le<U+00E3>o received a [[Bachelor's degree#Portugal|bachelor's degree]] in Law in 1824, and his [[Licentiate#Portugal|Master's]] diploma on 18 June 1825.<ref name="Janotti, p.28">[[#refJanotti2004|Janotti (1990)]], p. 28.</ref> He was an excellent student<ref name="Janotti, p.32">[[#refJanotti2004|Janotti (1990)]], p. 32.</ref> and associated with Brazilian classmates, including [[Paulino Soares de Sousa, 1st Viscount of Uruguay|Paulino Soares]] (who would later become one of his greatest allies<ref>[[#refCarvalho2002|Carvalho (2002)]], p. 12.</ref>) and [[Aureliano de Sousa Oliveira Coutinho]] (who later proved to be a fierce political opponent).<ref name="Janotti, p.28"/> During the Portuguese [[Liberal Revolution of 1820|Revolution of 1820]], he supported the constitutionalists, who advocated a national constitution to limit the powers of the Portuguese monarchy, against the absolutists, who preferred an absolute monarchy. It is unknown whether he actively took part in the uprising, however, and, if so, to what degree.<ref>[[#refJanotti2004|Janotti (1990)]], pp. 31<U+2013>32.</ref> He was employed in a law firm for a few months<ref>[[#refJanotti2004|Janotti (1990)]], pp. 29<U+2013>30.</ref> before returning to [[Brazil]] on 9 August 1825.<ref name="Dias, p.414"/><ref name="Janotti, p.32"/>

==Entry into politics==
===From judge to national deputy===
On 20 May 1826, Carneiro Le<U+00E3>o married his first cousin Maria Henriqueta Neto (born 1809), the daughter of his father's brother Jo<U+00E3>o Neto Carneiro Leme.<ref name="Dias, p.414"/><ref>[[#refJanotti2004|Janotti (1990)]], pp. 32<U+2013>33.</ref> Unlike his brother, Jo<U+00E3>o Neto was a rich and influential man who owned a rice processing plant and was also involved in diamonds and the [[slave trader|slave trade]].<ref name="Dias, p.414"/><ref>[[#refJanotti2004|Janotti (1990)]], p. 33.</ref> The couple had four children: Hon<U+00F3>rio Hermeto Carneiro Le<U+00E3>o Filho, Henrique Hermeto (later Baron of Paran<U+00E1>), Maria Em<U+00ED>lia and Maria Henriqueta.<ref name="Dias, p.414"/>
[[File:Marquesa de parana por emilio bauch.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=Three-quarters length portrait of the marquesa in formal gown with dark lace, wearing a long pearl necklace and holding a closed fan in her left hand|Maria Henriqueta at age 47, 1856]]

On 14 October 1826, he was named to a three-year term as [[magistrate]] with jurisdiction over the villages of [[S<U+00E3>o Sebasti<U+00E3>o, S<U+00E3>o Paulo|S<U+00E3>o Sebasti<U+00E3>o]], [[Ilhabela, S<U+00E3>o Paulo|Bela da Princesa]] and [[Ubatuba]], in the then-province of [[S<U+00E3>o Paulo (state)|S<U+00E3>o Paulo]].<ref name="Dias, p.414"/><ref>[[#refJanotti2004|Janotti (1990)]], p. 34.</ref> To S<U+00E3>o Sebasti<U+00E3>o, he brought his wife and gifts from his father-in-law: eight [[slave]]s, expensive furniture and a set of silver tableware.<ref name="Dias, p.414"/><ref>[[#refJanotti2004|Janotti (1990)]], p. 35.</ref> Nothing of note seems to have occurred during his tenure as magistrate, apart from a quarrel with the village's military commander, lieutenant-colonel Lopo da Cunha d<U+2019>E<U+00E7>a e Costa. Carneiro Le<U+00E3>o and Cunha disagreed on the boundaries of their respective jurisdictions, in what was in reality a personal dispute over who held power over the region.<ref name="Dias, p.414"/><ref>[[#refJanotti2004|Janotti (1990)]], p. 37.</ref> Carneiro Le<U+00E3>o ended up being promoted, adding to his duties the post of deputy [[Judge Advocate General]] of the Navy in [[Rio de Janeiro]], then known as the "Neutral Municipality". He left S<U+00E3>o Sebasti<U+00E3>o on 25 August 1828. In 1829, he was appointed as an [[appellate court]] justice,<ref name="Dias, p.414"/><ref name="Janotti, p.45">[[#refJanotti2004|Janotti (1990)]], p. 45.</ref> and held this office until retirement in 1848.<ref name="Janotti, p.45"/> He was prevented from joining the [[Superior Court of Justice (Brazil)|Superior Court of Justice]] in 1848, as it was forbidden to both hold that position and retain a seat on the [[privy council|Council of State]], of which he had become a member by the time.<ref name="Janotti, p.45"/>

Carneiro Le<U+00E3>o campaigned in 1829 to become a member of the [[Chamber of Deputies of Brazil|Chamber of Deputies]] as a representative for Minas Gerais. He was elected to a seat in the legislature for the term beginning in April 1830. The law allowed him to work as both judge and legislator at the same time, receiving wages from both offices.<ref>[[#refJanotti2004|Janotti (1990)]], p. 46.</ref> He had a modest start in the Chamber, primarily focusing on bureaucratic activities such as participation in parliamentary committees.<ref>[[#refJanotti2004|Janotti (1990)]], pp. 48, 60.</ref> A member of the opposition to Emperor [[Don (honorific)|Dom]] [[Pedro I of Brazil|Pedro I]]'s government, Carneiro Le<U+00E3>o displayed no indication of the energetic leadership and strong personality for which he would later become famous.<ref>[[#refJanotti2004|Janotti (1990)]], p. 63.</ref> However, this would change radically in the 1830s, upon Brazil's fall into anarchy during the regency period.<ref>[[#refJanotti2004|Janotti (1990)]], p. 79.</ref>

On 7 April 1831, Emperor Pedro I abdicated and departed for Europe, leaving behind his son [[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro II]], a child of five, [[minority reign|as emperor]].{{ref label|notabene_A|A|none}} This development was unexpected and deplored by the Brazilian people.<ref>[[#refJanotti2004|Janotti (1990)]], p. 180.</ref> A [[regent|regency]] with little effective authority was created, resulting in nine years of chaos during which the country was plagued by rebellions and coup attempts initiated by unruly political factions.<ref>[[#refLyrav1|Lyra (vol.1, 1977)]], p. 21.</ref>

Carneiro Le<U+00E3>o was part of what historian Roderick J. Barman called the ''Coimbra bloc'', so named because many of its supporters had graduated from the University of Coimbra.<ref name="Barman 1999, p.59">[[#refBarman1999|Barman (1999)]], p. 59.</ref> The Coimbra bloc was part of a coalition called the Moderate Party, which also included the Nativists political faction, whose main leader was the priest [[Diogo Ant<U+00F4>nio Feij<U+00F3>]].<ref name="Barman 1999, p.58">[[#refBarman1999|Barman (1999)]], p. 58.</ref> The Coimbra bloc's main leaders were [[Pedro de Ara<U+00FA>jo Lima, Marquis of Olinda|Pedro de Ara<U+00FA>jo Lima]] (later Marquis of Olinda) and [[Bernardo Pereira de Vasconcelos]].<ref name="Barman 1999, p.59"/> Vasconcelos acted not only as leader but also as mentor to the younger generation of his faction, which included Carneiro Le<U+00E3>o, Paulino de Sousa (Carneiro Le<U+00E3>o's former colleague during his Coimbra years) and [[Joaquim Rodrigues Torres, Viscount of Itabora<U+00ED>|Joaquim Jos<U+00E9> Rodrigues Torres]] (later Viscount of Itabora<U+00ED> and husband to a sister-in-law of Paulino de Sousa).<ref>[[#refCarvalho2002|Carvalho (2002)]], p. 18.</ref>

One of the two common interests uniting the Nativists and the Coimbra bloc was their support of federalism.<ref>[[#refDolhnikoff2005|Dolhnikoff (2005)]], p. 61.</ref> The Brazilian constitution was overly centralized, and this was one of the main reasons behind their opposition to the former emperor,<ref>[[#refDolhnikoff2005|Dolhnikoff (2005)]], p. 89.</ref> who openly opposed any [[constitutional amendment]]s.<ref>[[#refJanotti2004|Janotti (1990)]], p. 145.</ref> The Moderate Party believed it could placate discontent and extinguish any separatist threat by granting more autonomy to the provinces.<ref name="Barman 1999, p.58"/><ref>[[#refDolhnikoff2005|Dolhnikoff (2005)]], p. 63.</ref> The other shared interest was their opposition to the restorationist movement.<ref>[[#refBarman1999|Barman (1999)]], p. 60.</ref> The restorationists were politicians and military officers who called for the return of Pedro I as regent for his son.<ref>[[#refBarman1999|Barman (1999)]], p. 42.</ref>

===Defender of the Constitution===

Carneiro Le<U+00E3>o was one of the deputies who supported decentralization,<ref>[[#refDolhnikoff2005|Dolhnikoff (2005)]], p. 64.</ref> but progress on this and other matters was delayed while he was forced to deal with two major crises. The first occurred on 19 July 1831 when a group of republicans and insubordinate military officers presented the Chamber of Deputies with a list of 89 names of Brazilians whom they demanded be deported. The list included some senators.<ref>[[#refJanotti2004|Janotti (1990)]], p. 120.</ref> Had the government acceded to their demands, it would have become further demoralized and weakened. Carneiro Le<U+00E3>o averted that threat by giving four speeches during the same day in which he urged the government to refuse this illegal demand.<ref>[[#refJanotti2004|Janotti (1990)]], p. 122.</ref> He stated that "neither a senator nor the most humble citizen belonging to the lowest class may be deported without having been prosecuted and convicted",<ref>[[#refJanotti2004|Janotti (1990)]], p. 126.</ref> and concluded: "The constitution establishes rights and obligations, and, to keep the former, citizens must satisfy the latter; as these are fulfilled, no one can deprive them of the former. Even when a citizen is an evildoer, his rights must be respected, as these do not belong to him but to all."<ref>[[#refJanotti2004|Janotti (1990)]], p. 127.</ref> All deputies but one agreed with Carneiro Le<U+00E3>o,<ref>[[#refJanotti2004|Janotti (1990)]], p. 124.</ref> and the incident was settled with the disbandment of several battalions.<ref>[[#refJanotti2004|Janotti (1990)]], p. 129.</ref>
[[File:Brazilian chamber of deputies empire.jpg|thumb|alt=An old print showing the Chamber of Deputies building, a two-story structure which is neoclassical in style with pilasters at the corners and at the central pediment, and balconies under the windows of the main floor|Chamber of Deputies of the [[Empire of Brazil]]]]
The second crisis arose on 30 July 1832. A constitutional amendment effecting greater decentralization was voted and approved in the Chamber of Deputies, but still faced major opposition in the Senate.<ref>[[#refJanotti2004|Janotti (1990)]], p. 148.</ref> Ant<U+00F4>nio Feij<U+00F3> and Aureliano Coutinho (Carneiro Le<U+00E3>o's former colleague at Coimbra) planned a coup d<U+2019><U+00E9>tat. The conspiracy would have had Feij<U+00F3> assume dictatorial powers and immediately enact the constitutional amendment, bypassing confirmation in the Senate.<ref>[[#refJanotti2004|Janotti (1990)]], p. 150.</ref> Some Nativist deputies (in concert with Feij<U+00F3>) brought a proposal before the Chamber that parliament be turned into a constituent assembly and a new constitution be adopted, arguing in part that the senate was filled with restorationists.<ref>[[#refJanotti2004|Janotti (1990)]], p. 158.</ref> 

The deputies decided to debate the matter, and Carneiro Le<U+00E3>o delivered a speech that proved to be a turning point in his political life.<ref>[[#refJanotti2004|Janotti (1990)]], p. 159.</ref> He called on his fellow deputies to uphold the constitution and only make changes through the proper legal channels: "We need not hurt the legal order and [constitutional] principles: we can make fair laws, [...] and in the respected constitution we have safe and legal ways of giving the nation what it wants." He then begged, "let us not violate it [the constitution], as it is our only safeguard."<ref name="Janotti, p.160">[[#refJanotti2004|Janotti (1990)]], p. 160.</ref> He managed to rally the deputies to his cause, and in defeating the Nativists' proposal, crush the coup attempt.<ref name="Janotti, p.160"/>

His defense of the constitution owed much to his character. Carneiro Le<U+00E3>o was a natural leader, energetic, intelligent, perspicacious, and reasonable. [[Joaquim Nabuco]] described him as more a man of action than of ideas.<ref name="Nabuco, p.154">[[#refNabuco1975|Nabuco (1975)]], p. 154.</ref> He could also be arrogant, rude (even aggressive), and authoritarian;<ref name="Lyra, p.183">[[#refLyrav1|Lyra (vol.1, 1977)]], p. 183.</ref> it has been observed that he was headstrong, opinionated, and often scathing.<ref name="Barman 1999, p.162"/> Pedro II would later remark that his "style of speaking was inelegant, and he had a stutter; but it vanished when he was aroused and at all times his arguments were tight knit, and somebody wittily remarked that the marquis of Paran<U+00E1>, when he stuttered, stuttered arguments."<ref name="Barman 1999, p.95">[[#refBarman1999|Barman (1999)]], p. 95.</ref> More important to the nation was his consistent and unconditional support of constitutional order.<ref>[[#refJanotti2004|Janotti (1990)]], p. 147.</ref> In concert with his colleagues, his efforts prevented restriction of [[legal rights]] and kept Brazil from sliding into [[dictatorship]].<ref name="Lyra, p.183"/>

==Rise of the Conservative Party==
===Party's leader in the Chamber of Deputies===

Carneiro Le<U+00E3>o had become a leading politician, and was appointed minister of Justice on 13 September 1832.<ref>[[#refJanotti2004|Janotti (1990)]], p. 167.</ref> He resigned after a few months to avoid becoming entangled in the aftermath of a restorationist uprising in Minas Gerais, in which a relative of his had been involved.<ref>[[#refDias1969|Dias (1969)]], p. 417.</ref> On 12 August 1834, a constitutional amendment known as the ''Ato Adicional'' (Additional Act) was promulgated.<ref name="Barman 1999, p.61">[[#refBarman1999|Barman (1999)]], p. 61.</ref> Among its provisions were the abolition of the Council of State and the establishment of a federal national structure resulting in administrative and political provincial decentralization.<ref name="Barman 1999, p.61"/> Local self-government opened new avenues for conflict between political parties. Ceding power to provincial governments merely whetted the ambitions of local politicians, however, and the result was rebellion in areas of the far south and far north of the Empire.<ref name="Barman 1999, p.61"/> Whichever party could dominate the provinces also gained control over the electoral and political system. Unwilling to accept being shut out, parties that lost at the ballot rebelled and tried to take power by force.<ref>[[#refDolhnikoff2005|Dolhnikoff (2005)]], p. 206.</ref>
[[File:Brazilian senate in the empire.jpg|thumb|left|alt=An old print showing the neoclassical Senate building at the corner of two streets, with the low ground floor having a simple doorway and few windows while the first floor was lined with tall, flat-arched windows between which were double pilasters which continued through the parapet above|Senate of the Empire of Brazil]]
In April 1835, an election was held to select a new regent. The outcome was problematic, as no candidate won a majority. Feij<U+00F3>, the leader of the Nativists, garnered the most votes and assumed office on 12 October.<ref name="Barman 1999, p.61"/> Earlier, news of the premature death of former emperor Pedro I on 24 September 1834 had arrived from Europe, removing the restorationist movement as a factor in national politics.<ref name="Barman 1999, p.61"/> Many restorationists joined the ranks of the Coimbra bloc.

Once in office, Feij<U+00F3> proved authoritarian, with little inclination to be accountable to parliament. By 1837, his government's credibility and support had vanished.

Feijo's Nativists allied with minor parties and remnants of other factions in opposition to the new government, despite sharing no common principles or ideology.

===Against the Liberal rebellions of 1842===

The Coimbra bloc was not opposed to lowering the age of majority for the Emperor, as Carneiro Le<U+00E3>o himself explained, but they demanded that any change should be made through legal means, i.e., a constitutional amendment.<ref>[[#refGouveia1962|Gouveia (1962)]], p. 90.</ref> Carneiro Le<U+00E3>o proposed a bill towards that end, but it was defeated in the Senate by only two votes on 17 May 1840.<ref>[[#refBarman1999|Barman (1999)]], p. 71.</ref> The Liberals were less scrupulous and, with popular support and after pressuring the regent to accept the loss of his position, declared Pedro II of age on 23 July 1840.<ref>[[#refBarman1999|Barman (1999)]], p. 72.</ref> The Liberal Cabinet, formed upon the assumption of majority by Pedro II, called national elections in 1840.

Following this, Carneiro Le<U+00E3>o was awarded with two lifelong offices: his appointment by the Emperor to the [[Privy Council|Council of State]] which had been restored by the legislation of 21 November 1841, and his election as senator representing Minas Gerais in late 1842<ref>[[#refGouveia1962|Gouveia (1962)]], p. 122.</ref> (seated on 2 January 1843).<ref>[[#refGouveia1962|Gouveia (1962)]], p. 123.</ref> Carneiro Le<U+00E3>o was also appointed president (governor) of the province of Rio de Janeiro on 4 October 1841 and assumed this office on 1 December.<ref>[[#refGouveia1962|Gouveia (1962)]], p. 95.</ref>

The Liberals did not accept their loss of power gracefully. In May and June 1842, there followed three uprisings within the provinces of S<U+00E3>o Paulo, Minas Gerais and Rio de Janeiro itself. The pretext was a claim that the Emperor was being restrained by the insolent new government.<ref>[[#refBarman1999|Barman (1999)]], p. 88.</ref> The rebels went so far as to arrest and hold hostage Carneiro Le<U+00E3>o's elderly father and uncle.<ref>[[#refGouveia1962|Gouveia (1962)]], p. 110.</ref> As president, he was in command of the provincial National Guard and traveled through the province organizing the response.<ref name="Gouveia, p.111">[[#refGouveia1962|Gouveia (1962)]], p. 111.</ref> On 1 July he advanced with 100 soldiers towards [[Ouro Preto]] in Minas Gerais where, after defeating the rebels, he freed his father and uncle.<ref name="Gouveia, p.111"/> The remaining rebels were easily defeated, and by late August, the rebellions were over.<ref>[[#refBarman1999|Barman (1999)]], p. 89.</ref> Among the rebel leaders was the former Regent Feij<U+00F3>, who was arrested and died shortly afterwards in 1843.<ref>[[#refVainfas2002|Vainfas (2002)]], p. 209.</ref> As Carneiro Le<U+00E3>o traveled from Minas Gerais to Rio de Janeiro, he was received with celebrations and demonstrations of joy by the authorities and populace of the districts through which he passed.<ref>[[#refGouveia1962|Gouveia (1962)]], p. 119.</ref>

Members of the Coimbra bloc began to call it the "Party of Order" in contrast to what they perceived as the "unruly" Liberals.<ref>[[#refNeedell2005|Needell (2006)]], p. 110.</ref> Their suppression of the uprisings had enhanced the government's reputation and position.<ref name="Barman 1999, p.93">[[#refBarman1999|Barman (1999)]], p. 93.</ref> In the Cabinet, however, there was increasing friction<ref name="Barman 1999, p.93"/> caused by Aureliano Coutinho, who owed his seat as minister solely to his influence over Pedro II.

===President of the Council of Ministers and fall===

On 20 January 1843 the Emperor appointed Senator Carneiro Le<U+00E3>o to head a new Cabinet.<ref name="Lyra, p.102">[[#refLyrav1|Lyra (vol.1, 1977)]], p. 102.</ref><ref>[[#refBarman1999|Barman (1999)]], pp. 94, 100.</ref> Carneiro Le<U+00E3>o showed preference for his co-party members when filling Cabinet positions and deliberately overlooked Aureliano Coutinho.<ref name="Lyra, p.102"/> By personally selecting the Cabinet members, he became Brazil's ''de facto'' first prime minister. Prior to this, the emperor had always designated the Cabinet ministers. Following on this precedent, the office of prime minister would be formally instituted four years later, under the title "[[President of the Council of Ministers of Brazil|President of the Council of Ministers]]".<ref name="Barman 1999, p.120">[[#refBarman1999|Barman (1999)]], p. 120.</ref><ref>[[#refNabuco1975|Nabuco (1975)]], p. 88.</ref><ref>[[#refCalmon1975|Calmon (1975)]], p. 173.</ref> The Party of Order at this time held majorities in the Senate, in the Chamber of Deputies and in the Council of State.<ref name="Barman 1999, p.95"/><ref name="Lyra, p.102"/> The new Cabinet opposed amnesty for participants in the 1842 uprisings, even though many involved had already been imprisoned for almost a year, which rendered the possibilities for successful prosecution unlikely. Carneiro Le<U+00E3>o, acting as minister of Justice, also pursued indictments against five senators who had collaborated during the revolts, seeking a trial in the upper house. This came to dominate debate in the Senate and sidelined action on the government's legislative agenda during the ten months of the extended session. As the process dragged on, inflexibility on the part of the Cabinet began to seriously undermine its support.<ref>[[#refBarman1999|Barman (1999)]], p. 100.</ref>

In January 1844 he requested the dismissal of the inspector of the Rio de Janeiro customs house, alleging that it was a post under his discretion when it was actually an administrative position, and causing a direct confrontation with Pedro II.<ref name="Lyra, p.103">[[#refLyrav1|Lyra (vol.1, 1977)]], p. 103.</ref><ref name="Barman 1999, p.101">[[#refBarman1999|Barman (1999)]], p. 101.</ref> The inspector was Saturnino de Sousa e Oliveira Coutinho, a younger brother of Aureliano who had been secretly trying to undermine the Cabinet<ref name="Barman 1999, p.101"/> by publishing pamphlets attacking it.<ref>[[#refDias1969|Dias (1969)]], p. 422.</ref> Carneiro Le<U+00E3>o mistakenly believed that he could diminish the political influence of his rival.<ref name="Lyra, p.103"/> But the Emperor refused, affirming that he had not been presented with any proof of irregularities on the part of Saturnino, who was considered an honest and extremely competent employee.<ref>[[#refCalmon1975|Calmon (1975)]], p. 175.</ref><ref>[[#refLyrav1|Lyra (vol.1, 1977)]], pp. 103<U+2013>104.</ref> Carneiro Le<U+00E3>o insisted on the resignation of the inspector a second time at the end of January, and when he was rebuffed once again, he said, "A boy does not have the right to mock men worn out in the service of the Nation, even if this boy is the Emperor."<ref>[[#refLyrav1|Lyra (vol.1, 1977)]], p. 301.</ref> Pedro II was offended and steadfastly refused to dismiss Saturnino Coutinho, explaining the reason years later: "I considered the dismissal to be unjust, and due to the manner in which Carneiro Le<U+00E3>o insisted on it, I thought that if I gave way I would be considered weak."<ref>[[#refBarman1999|Barman (1999)]], p. 102.</ref><ref name="Calmon 1975, p.176">[[#refCalmon1975|Calmon (1975)]], p. 176.</ref>

Instead of accepting the Emperor's decision, Carneiro Le<U+00E3>o offered his resignation along with those of his colleagues.<ref name="Calmon 1975, p.176"/> Admiring the president's integrity, the Emperor would say years later when recalling the incident: "''Paran<U+00E1> n<U+00E3>o se curvava!''" ("Paran<U+00E1> did not bow down!")<ref name="Lyra, p.103"/><ref name="Carvalho 2007, p.55">[[#refCarvalho2007|Carvalho (2007)]], p. 55.</ref> The relationship between them remained strained for years, but the admiration and respect that Pedro II had for Carneiro Le<U+00E3>o did not diminish,<ref name="Carvalho 2007, p.55"/> nor did the politician's loyalty towards the Emperor.<ref>[[#refCarvalho2007|Carvalho (2007)]], p. 60.</ref> Years later Pedro II would reveal that "The Marquis of Paran<U+00E1> told me that he had forgiven any misdeed I may have committed against Carneiro Le<U+00E3>o."<ref>[[#refLyrav1|Lyra (vol.1, 1977)]], p. 300.</ref>

For the next four years Carneiro Le<U+00E3>o and his colleagues stood in opposition to the Liberals. During this time, they also witnessed the rise and fall of Aureliano Coutinho's "Courtier Faction", which was allied to the Liberal Party. The Courtier Faction held nearly absolute sway over Brazilian politics for a couple of years. This lasted until the Emperor, fully grown and experienced, purged everyone linked to the group, including Aureliano (whose influence was destroyed after Pedro II implicitly banished him from participation in political decision-making).<ref>[[#refBarman1999|Barman (1999)]], pp. 112<U+2013>114.</ref> The monarch made clear that he thereafter would make his own, impartial decisions, free of the influence of others.<ref>[[#refBarman1999|Barman (1999)]], p. 114.</ref> From February 1844 through May 1848 the country saw four cabinets in succession, all composed of members from the Liberal Party. The inability of all four to produce any concrete results stood as testimony to their internal divisions. Progressive initiatives lay dormant, including technological innovations such as a telegraph system, railroads, and expanding primary education.<ref name="Barman 1999, p.123">[[#refBarman1999|Barman (1999)]], p. 123.</ref> After the last Liberal Cabinet resigned, Pedro II called upon the Party of Order, by then known simply as the "Conservative Party" (to "[[Conservatism|preserve]]" the order and the constitutional monarchy),<ref name="Barman 1999, p.120"/> to form a new Cabinet.<ref name="Barman 1999, p.123"/> The former regent [[Pedro de Ara<U+00FA>jo Lima, Marquis of Olinda|Pedro de Ara<U+00FA>jo Lima]], who at that point was the chief figure among Conservatives, assumed the office of president.<ref name="Lyra, p.157">[[#refLyrav1|Lyra (vol.1, 1977)]], p. 157.</ref> The only other politician with enough prestige to merit the position was Carneiro Le<U+00E3>o, but his quarrel with the Emperor was still a vivid memory.

On 6 September 1853 the Viscount of Paran<U+00E1> was appointed [[President of the Council of Ministers of Brazil|President of the Council of Ministers]] and charged with organizing a new Cabinet.<ref name="Vainfas, p.343"/> He was at this time the main leader of the Conservative Party<ref>[[#refNabuco1975|Nabuco (1975)]], p. 161.</ref> and the most influential politician in the country.<ref name="Nabuco, p.154"/> Paran<U+00E1> had seen both his main foes, Aureliano Coutinho and Feij<U+00F3>, and their political factions fall into oblivion while he rose to power. Emperor Pedro II wished to make amends for what he considered an injustice committed against Paran<U+00E1> in 1844, and at the same time to advance his ambitious plan: the Conciliation.<ref name="Lima, p.38">[[#refLima1989|Lima (1989)]], p. 38.</ref><ref>[[#refLyrav1|Lyra (vol.1, 1977)]], p. 182.</ref> The goal of the Conciliation was to put an end to armed conflicts between political factions (begun by Restorationists at the beginning of the 1830s, and continued by Liberals). It had become usual for parties which were ousted from power in elections to attempt to regain it by force of arms, as happened in 1842 and 1848. From that point on, political disputes were to be settled democratically in the parliament. Both parties would be required to rise above passionate partisanship and instead devote themselves to the common good of the nation.<ref name="Barman 1999, p.162"/><ref name="Vainfas, p.343"/>

Paran<U+00E1> took the [[Ministry of Finance (Brazil)|Ministry of Finance]] for himself<ref name="Vainfas, p.343"/> and invited converted Liberals to assume some of the other Cabinet portfolios. These included his prot<U+00E9>g<U+00E9>e [[Jos<U+00E9> Paranhos, Viscount of Rio Branco|Jos<U+00E9> Paranhos]] (Foreign ministry), [[Ant<U+00F4>nio Paulino Limpo de Abreu]] (Foreign ministry before Paranhos) and [[Lu<U+00ED>s Pedreira de Couto Ferraz]] (Empire [Interior] ministry).<ref name="Lima, p.38"/> From the Conservative bloc, he selected [[Jos<U+00E9> Nabuco de Ara<U+00FA>jo]] (Justice ministry), [[Pedro de Alc<U+00E2>ntara Bellengarde]] (Navy ministry), the [[Lu<U+00ED>s Alves de Lima e Silva|Marquis of Caxias]] (War ministry) and [[Jo<U+00E3>o Maur<U+00ED>cio Wanderley]] (Navy ministry after Bellegarde).<ref>[[#refNabuco1975|Nabuco (1975)]], pp. 156<U+2013>161.</ref> The selection of former Liberals for Cabinet seats was controversial. The Liberals knew that they could not return to power through the ballot box, and many happily approved Paran<U+00E1>'s policy of accepting anyone who desired to join the Conservative ranks.<ref>[[#refLyrav1|Lyra (vol.1, 1977)]], p. 187.</ref><ref name="Barman 1999, p.166">[[#refBarman1999|Barman (1999)]], p. 166.</ref> On the other hand, traditional Conservatives (including the [[Joaquim Rodrigues Torres, Viscount of Itabora<U+00ED>|Viscount of Itabora<U+00ED>]], [[Eus<U+00E9>bio de Queir<U+00F3>s]], the [[Paulino Soares de Sousa, 1st Viscount of Uruguay|Viscount of Uruguay]] and [[<U+00C2>ngelo Ferraz]]) repudiated the adoption of these newly made Conservatives, believing that these did not truly share Conservative ideals and that they were instead more interested in gaining public offices.<ref name="Barman 1999, p.166"/><ref name="Lyra, p.188">[[#refLyrav1|Lyra (vol.1, 1977)]], p. 188.</ref> The Emperor himself was disappointed in the manner in which the "conciliation" was implemented by Paran<U+00E1>.<ref name="Lyra, p.188"/><ref name="Lima, p.39">[[#refLima1989|Lima (1989)]], p. 39.</ref>

Despite the mistrust, the viscount was resilient and able to triumph over reverses and obstruction.<ref name="Barman 1999, p.166"/> His Cabinet was quite successful, maintaining the national stability achieved by previous Conservative governments since 1848,<ref name="Vainfas, p.343"/><ref name="Dias, p.427">[[#refDias1969|Dias (1969)]], p. 427.</ref> and allowed him to proudly affirm that "past fights have ended and have been forgotten".<ref>[[#refLyrav1|Lyra (vol.1, 1977)]], p. 185.</ref> Improvements throughout the country were made, including the first railroad, steamship passenger lines, sewers, and public gas illumination, as well as new incentives to promote immigration from Europe.<ref name="Lima, p.39"/> In the Parliament, Paran<U+00E1> defined his government as "progressive-conservative and conservative-progressive".<ref name="Lima, p.39"/><ref name="Dias, p.428">[[#refDias1969|Dias (1969)]], p. 428.</ref> In recognition of his merits, the Emperor raised him from viscount to marquis on 2 December 1854.<ref name="Gouveia, p.251">[[#refGouveia1962|Gouveia (1962)]], p. 251.</ref> However, Paran<U+00E1>'s greatest goal was the elimination of electoral fraud, and towards that end he introduced [[Politics of the Empire of Brazil#Reforms to improve the electoral system|reforms of the electoral system]] through the Law of Circles ([[Electoral district|Districts]]), which was enacted in 1855.<ref name="Vainfas, p.343"/><ref name="Lima, p.39"/><ref name="Dias, p.427"/> The reform considerably diminished fraud in elections.<ref>[[#refVainfas2002|Vainfas (2002)]], p. 225.</ref><ref>[[#refNabuco1975|Nabuco (1975)]], pp. 310<U+2013>311.</ref>

The marquis was at the height of his career when he was unexpectedly struck down by disease on 3 September 1856. The diagnosis was that he had died of a "pernicious fever",<ref name="Vainfas, p.343"/><ref>[[#refLima1989|Lima (1989)]], p. 40.</ref> which may have been [[yellow fever]]<ref>[[#refVainfas2002|Vainfas (2002)]], p. 187.</ref> or [[hepatitis]] aggravated by [[pneumonia]].<ref name="Dias, p.428"/> In a fever-induced delirium, Paran<U+00E1> believed himself to be delivering a speech to the Senate. His last words were: "Skepticism ... the noble senator ... fatherland ... freedom."<ref name="Dias, p.428"/> Pedro II lamented the death of Paran<U+00E1> saying that "I can see no one else possessed of the energy with which the late marquis was endowed, and joined to it uncommon talents, even if they were unpolished."<ref name="Barman 1999, p.166"/> His Cabinet survived him, albeit with Caxias as president,<ref>[[#refNabuco1975|Nabuco (1975)]], p. 308.</ref> until 4 May 1857.<ref>[[#refNabuco1975|Nabuco (1975)]], p. 313.</ref>

==Legacy==
The death of Paran<U+00E1> had a profound impact on both the government and the Brazilian people.<ref name="Gouveia, p.276">[[#refGouveia1962|Gouveia (1962)]], p. 276.</ref> He was honored with a grand funeral procession attended by a huge crowd, a rare event in Brazil at the time.<ref name="Gouveia, p.276"/> Writer [[Joaquim Manuel de Macedo]] said that "the marquis of Paran<U+00E1> was a politician well suited to the great State crises, and to a time of most difficult and contentious political strife."<ref>[[#refGouveia1962|Gouveia (1962)]], p. 277.</ref> [[Joaquim Nabuco]], who viewed him a statesman, summarized his character as a man "made not only to dominate, but also to lead."<ref name="Gouveia, p.278">[[#refGouveia1962|Gouveia (1962)]], p. 278.</ref> [[Euclides da Cunha]], who also called him a statesman, calls him a "great man" who "demarcates a decisive stretch in our [Brazilian] Constitutional History".<ref>[[#refJanotti2004|Janotti (1990)]], p. 12.</ref>

Historian Maur<U+00ED>lio de Gouveia wrote: "[Paran<U+00E1>] reveals himself to posterity as an example of tenacity, energy, patriotism and honor".<ref name="Gouveia, p.278"/> To historian Heitor Lyra, the marquis was one of the pillars responsible for the political stability of Pedro II's reign. His policy of "conciliation" ended a period of rebellions, and led to the appearance of a new generation of monarchist politicians raised "in the school of tolerance, mutual respect and public interest", which produced "the constitutional environment where the two great [political] parties of the Monarchy would take turns [in power] without excluding each other."<ref>[[#refLyrav1|Lyra (vol.1, 1977)]], p. 194.</ref> Historian Aldo Janotti considered Paran<U+00E1>, alongside Bernardo Pereira de Vasconcelos, as being responsible for the maintenance of Brazilian unity and preventing its territorial dismemberment.<ref>[[#refJanotti2004|Janotti (1990)]], p. 232.</ref>
