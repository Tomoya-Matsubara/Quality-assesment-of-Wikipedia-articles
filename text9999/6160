==Life==

Naeemi, son of Mufti Muhammad Hussain Naeemi, was born on 16 February 1948.<ref name="DailyT"/> His ancestors had migrated to Pakistan from [[Moradabad]] in [[British Raj|India]].<ref name=DTProfile/>  He was the senior cleric at the Jaamia Naeemia [[madrasah]] in [[Lahore]], [[Pakistan]].  He became the principal of Jamia Naeemia in 1998 after the death of his father. He has four daughters and one son, Raghib Hussain Naeemi, who will succeed him as principal of Jamia Naeemia after his death.<ref name=DTProfile/>  The school is located in Garhi Shahu neighbourhood of [[Lahore]] and is considered one of the most prominent Islamic schools in Pakistan.<ref name= NYT1/>  He got his early education from Jamia Naeemia and then did PhD from the [[University of the Punjab|Punjab University]] besides a short course from [[Al-Azhar University]], in Egypt.  He was a humble and widely respected scholar.<ref>[http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/news/pakistan/12-naeemi-worked-for-alliance+-gainst-taliban--bi-08 Naeemi worked for <U+2018>alliance against Taliban<U+2019>], [[Dawn (newspaper)]], 2009-06-12</ref>  He was a follower of [[Barelwi]] school of thought which is somewhat at odds with the more fundamentalist [[Deobandi]] school followed by many segments of the Taliban (though is certainly not limited to just members of the Taliban nor is it a more inherently violent or hatemongering Islamic school of thought in of itself).<ref name=NYT1>[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/13/world/asia/13pstan.html Moderate Cleric Killed in Pakistan], [[The New York Times]], 2009-06-12</ref>  He had a reputation of being one of the most progressive clerics in Pakistan.<ref>[http://www.csmonitor.com/2009/0612/p06s20-wosc.html Pakistan attack targets moderate cleric], [[The Christian Science Monitor]], 2009-06-12</ref>  He knew [[Urdu]], Arabic and Persian languages well and wrote columns in newspapers on religious issues and was the editor of monthly Arafat, Lahore.<ref name=DTProfile/>

==Views==

Naeemi was known for his outspoken views against suicide bombings and militancy, for openly supporting the [[Second Battle of Swat|ongoing operation]] by Pakistan army in [[Swat, Pakistan|Swat]], and for labeling the activities of the Taliban "[[haram|un-Islamic]]".<ref>[http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/news/pakistan/metropolitan/07-suicide-blast-near-jamia-naeemia-mosque-in-lahore-ha-02 Suicide bomber kills anti-Taliban cleric Allama Naeemi]</ref> In May 2009 he was quoted by [[Reuters]] as having said, "The military must eliminate the Taliban once and for all otherwise they will capture the entire country which would be a big catastrophe."<ref>[http://www.canada.com/news/Anti+Taliban+cleric+killed+Pakistan+blast/1689133/story.html Anti-Taliban cleric killed in Pakistan blast], [[Canwest News Service]], 2009-06-12</ref>  Also in May 2009, he took part in a conference of Islamic scholars convened by the government which criticized suicide attacks and the beheading of innocent Muslims as un-Islamic.<ref name= BBC1/>  He advocated equal access to education for women and the use of computers in schools, ideas in contrast with Taliban's harsh interpretation of Islam.<ref>[http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hkiMxbHNH0BqgpWA2ZG6VD6wVTmAD98PB2UO0 Suicide bombers strike Pakistan mosque, seminary], [[Associated Press]], 2009-06-12</ref>

Naeemi has also organised demonstrations against the Taliban as well organising an alliance of religious organisations to oppose the Taliban. Last month the Sunni Ittehad Council announced that they "strongly condemn the Taliban and urge the Pakistan military to eliminate them at the earliest", the council also said it would "unveil the real face of the Taliban before the public" by exposing their brutality.<ref>[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/antitaliban-cleric-killed-by-bomb-1704149.html Anti-Taliban cleric killed by bomb  Independent]</ref> He had also passed a [[fatw<U+0101>]] denouncing suicide bombings,<ref>[http://english.aljazeera.net/news/asia/2009/06/200961215382855380.html  Bombers target two Pakistani cities Al Jazeera]</ref> as well as criticising Taliban leader [[Sufi Muhammad]] by saying he "should wear bangles if he is hiding like a woman". Naeemi had said <U+201C>Those who commit suicide attacks for attaining paradise will go to hell, as they kill many innocent people".<ref>[http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2009\06\13\story_13-6-2009_pg13_5 Anti-Taliban views cost Mufti Naeemi his life - Daily Times]</ref>  According to Khalid Zaheer, a Pakistani professor and religious scholar "His argument was simple: Religion does not stand for violence. You can't take the life of any individual, or your own life. And you can't wage [[jihad]] against your own state."<ref name= LAT1/>  Dr Naeemi was the driving force behind the Tahaffuz-e-Namoos-e-Risalat Mahaz (TNRM), a group of over 20 Sunni parties raising voice against the violence committed by the Taliban.<ref>[http://www.thenews.com.pk/top_story_detail.asp?Id=22712 Moderate voice silenced], [[The News International]], 2009-06-13</ref>  In January 2009 Tahaffuz-e-Namoos-e-Risalat Mahaz (TNRM) held a conference in Jamia Naeemia and issued a [[fatwa]] making [[Jihad]] obligatory for all Pakistani citizens in case of an attack by India.  In addition it called on Pakistan government to stop cooperating with United States in the event of war with India.  The clerics also called upon Pakistan government to "unveil the Indian conspiracies hatched against Pakistan before the world".<ref>[http://www.indianexpress.com/news/pak-clerics-issue-fatwa-for-jehad-if-india-a/407326/ Pak clerics issue fatwa for jehad if India attacks], [[The Indian Express]], 2009-01-06</ref> 

He was known for a bold stance on global Muslim issues like victimization and suppression of Muslim movements and invasions on Muslim countries. He raised voice against [[Pervez Musharraf]]<U+2019>s decision to provide logistic support to US-led coalition in the war on terror for which he was first removed from his job as Khateeb in Auqaf Department and then arrested briefly.<ref name=DTProfile>[http://www.thenews.com.pk/daily_detail.asp?id=182787 Mufti Sarfraz Naeemi<U+2019>s profile], [[The News International]], 2009-06-13</ref>  Dr Naeemi frequently argued that American, Israeli and Indian intelligence services were supporting the Taliban in order to destabilize Pakistan and seize control of its nuclear arsenal.<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/06/16/AR2009061603413.html Cleric's Slaying Signifies a Shift], [[The Washington Post]], 2009-06-16</ref>

Shortly after the blast hundreds of mourners gathered at the mosque and chanted "Death to Taliban".<ref name= NYT1/>  Widespread protests were noted in Lahore after the attacks.  Security was increased around all major seminaries and mosques in the city.  All Pakistan traders association announced a countrywide strike for the following day.<ref>[http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/news/pakistan/metropolitan/09-protests-erupt-in-lahore-after-naeemis-killing-szh--02 Protests erupt in Lahore after Naeemi<U+2019>s killing], [[Dawn (newspaper)]], 2009-06-13</ref>  Naeemi's son Raghib filed a complaint the following day with the police saying "[[Baitullah Mehsud]] is responsible for planning and motivating the attack that killed my father," and accused him of murder.<ref name=AP1>[http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hkiMxbHNH0BqgpWA2ZG6VD6wVTmAD98PT8F81 Backers mourn cleric; Taliban claim fatal attacks], [[Associated Press]], 2009-06-13</ref>

The following day a general strike was observed in Pakistan. Karachi the commercial capital of the country was virtually shut down. About 200 activists of Jamaat Ahle Sunnat, a moderate Muslim sect, staged a mock funeral procession for the Taliban.  They chanted "Down with the Taliban, Taliban is the enemy of Islam, death for the killers of Sarfraz Naeemi."  Mohammad Arif, 35, a former Naeemi student who now works as a prayer leader at the mosque said "We have no doubts that Taliban have killed our leader, Our demand to the government is that they should kill each and every Taliban. We demand that their chief [[Baitullah Mehsud]] should be arrested and hanged in public. This is the only option to save this country."<ref name=AP1/>

In neighbouring [[India]], Muslim groups also protested against the killing of Naeemi and the activities of the Pakistani Taliban. The head of the Muslim Students Organization of India, Shahnawaz Warsi, said "We came together to protest the ongoing killings of Sunni scholars by the [[Wahhabi]] Talibani terrorists in Pakistan".  "We support the Pakistani government in its war against these terrorists.  Terrorists are nothing but enemy of Islam and have presented their distorted version of Islam," a leader of the protests said.<ref>[http://www.upi.com/Top_News/2009/06/16/Indian-Muslims-condemn-Pakistani-Taliban/UPI-78031245208305/ Indian Muslims condemn Pakistani Taliban]</ref>
