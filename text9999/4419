The '''River Dart''' is a [[river]] in [[Devon]], [[England]] which [[source (river)|rises]] high on [[Dartmoor]], and releases to the sea at [[Dartmouth, Devon|Dartmouth]]. Its valley and surrounding area is a place of great natural beauty.

==Watercourse==
The river's name is presumed to be [[Brythonic languages|Brythonic]] [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] meaning 'river where oak trees grow'<ref>ISBN 0-19-852758-6 Oxford Dictionary of British Place Names</ref> due to the banks of the lower Dart being covered in ancient woods of native [[oak]]<ref>http://www.dartmoor-npa.gov.uk/aurawprdeco6 [[Dartmoor National Park Authority]] press release on restoring ancient woodland in Dartmoor's valleys{{dead link|date=November 2013}}</ref> Bray notes in 1832 that the name was occasionally spelled 'Darant'.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=PpmOIoehptUC&pg=PA16#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=A Description of the Part of Devonshire Bordering on the Tamar and the Tavy ... - Mrs. Bray (Anna Eliza) - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-05-29}}</ref>

The river begins as two separate branches (the [[East Dart]] and [[West Dart]]), which join at [[Dartmeet]]. The paths along these rivers offer very attractive walking, and there are several small [[waterfall]]s. The rivers are crossed by a number of [[clapper bridge]]s, notably at the [[hamlet (place)|hamlet]] of [[Postbridge, Devon|Postbridge]].

After leaving the moor, the Dart flows southwards past [[Buckfast Abbey]] and through the towns of [[Buckfastleigh]], [[Dartington]] and [[Totnes]]. At Totnes, where there is a seventeenth century [[weir]] (rebuilt in the 1960s){{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}, it becomes [[tide|tidal]], and there are no bridges below the town.

[[File:Dart at Salmon leap 2.JPG|thumb|left|The River Dart showing the lower part of the [[fish ladder]] near [[Buckfastleigh]].]]

A passenger ferry operates across the river from the village of [[Dittisham]] to a point adjacent to the [[Greenway Estate]]. Formerly the home of the late crime writer [[Agatha Christie]], this has stunning views across the river, and the house and gardens are now owned by the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] and are open to the public.<ref name=grfy>{{cite web | title = Dittisham Departures | publisher = Greenway Ferry Service | url = http://www.greenwayferry.co.uk/dittishamdepartures.htm | accessdate = 2008-09-24 }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

The Dart [[estuary]] is a large [[ria]] and is popular for [[sailing]]. The village of [[Kingswear]] and town of [[Dartmouth, England|Dartmouth]] are on the east and west sides of the estuary, and are linked by two vehicle [[ferries]] and a passenger ferry.  The deep water port of Dartmouth is a sheltered haven.

The entrance to the river from the sea is a rocky entrance with cliffs either side. On the East side [[Kingswear Castle]] sits very close to the water's edge, and on the west side [[Dartmouth Castle]] is built on a rocky [[promontory]] at sea level.  The castles once operated a [[boom (navigational barrier)|defensive chain]] across the estuary, which was raised at dusk to destroy enemy ships attempting to attack the harbour.  The remains of the operating mechanisms for the chain are still visible in Dartmouth castle.

==Crossings==
[[File:The River Dart at Totnes.jpg|thumb|left|The River Dart facing upstream at Totnes, with Totnes Bridge in the background.]]
The flooded ria that forms the lower reaches of the Dart, with its deep water and steeply sloping valley sides, is a considerable barrier to crossing traffic. There are no bridges below [[Totnes]].

At the mouth of the river, it separates the communities of [[Dartmouth, Devon|Dartmouth]] and [[Kingswear]]. There have been proposals to bridge the river here, but these have come to nothing. Instead the two places are linked by, in order going upstream, the [[Dartmouth Lower Ferry|Lower Ferry]], [[Dartmouth Passenger Ferry|Passenger Ferry]] and [[Dartmouth Higher Ferry|Higher Ferry]]. The Lower and Higher ferries both carry vehicles, the Higher one linking the [[A379 road]].

Some {{convert|2.5|mi}} upstream of Dartmouth, the [[Greenway Ferry]] carries pedestrians across the river from the village of [[Dittisham]] to Greenway Quay.<ref name="grfy"/>

A further {{convert|5|mi}} upstream is Totnes, where the river is spanned by two road bridges, a railway bridge and a footbridge over. Totnes Bridge is the nearest bridge to the sea and is a road bridge built in 1826-28 by Charles Fowler. Some {{convert|1000|ft}} upstream is Brutus Bridge, constructed in 1982 as part of a road traffic-relief scheme and carrying the concurrent [[A385 road|A385]] and [[A381 road]]s. A further {{convert|0.5|mi}} upstream, the railway bridge carries the [[National Rail]] [[Exeter to Plymouth line]] over the river. Immediately upstream of the railway bridge is a footbridge, built in 1993 to provide access to the [[Totnes (Littlehempston) railway station|Totnes (Littlehempston)]] terminus of the [[South Devon Railway Trust|South Devon Railway]].<ref name="CP">{{cite book

==Navigation==
[[File:dartmouth.boats.750pix.jpg|thumb|right|[[Dartmouth Harbour]], with Kingswear in the background, and river cruise boats alongside Dartmouth Town Jetty.]]

The lower section of the River Dart forms Dartmouth Harbour, a deep water natural harbour with a long history of maritime usage. In modern times, the port's commercial activity has declined, but it is still a busy port for local [[fishing vessel]]s and a wide variety of [[yacht]]s and other private boats. Several local companies specialise in shipbuilding and repairs to small tonnage craft.<ref name=dhcg>{{cite web | url = http://www.dartharbour.org/commercial-vessels-guide/ | title = Commercial Vessels Guide | publisher = Dart Harbour & Navigation Authority | accessdate = 2008-09-25 }}</ref>

[[Dartmouth, Devon|Dartmouth]] is also the home of the [[Britannia Royal Naval College]] and as a result is routinely visited by sizeable [[naval ship]]s. Smaller naval tenders are often seen carrying out training exercises in the harbour and river. Large [[cruise ship]]s are occasional visitors, with the largest visitor to date being the [[Royal Princess|MV ''Royal Princess'']] (30,277 [[Gross Register Tonnage|GRT]]).<ref name="dhcg"/><ref name=dhvv>{{cite web | url = http://www.dartharbour.org/visiting-ships/ | title = Visiting Ships | publisher = Dart Harbour & Navigation Authority | accessdate = 2008-09-25 }}</ref>

Upstream, the Dart is navigable to seagoing vessels as far as the weir in [[Totnes]]. The river almost dries out for {{convert|2|mi}} below Totnes at [[spring tide]] low water, but vessels drawing up to {{convert|3|foot}} can proceed to Totnes from one and a half hours after low water. Above the weir, the river is navigable only to small craft such as [[kayak]]s and [[canoe]]s.<ref name=dhsd>{{cite web | url = http://www.dartharbour.org/harbour-river-guide/sailing-directions/ | title = Sailing Directions | publisher = Dart Harbour & Navigation Authority | accessdate = 2008-09-25 }}</ref>

Several companies operate trips on the river, including [[Dart Pleasure Craft Limited]], who also trade as ''River Link'' and operate the [[Dartmouth Passenger Ferry|Passenger Ferry]] between Dartmouth and [[Kingswear]]. These include cruises from Dartmouth to Totnes, which can be combined with journeys on the [[Paignton and Dartmouth Steam Railway]] and an [[open top bus]] between Totnes and [[Paignton]] to create a circular trip.<ref name=dhrt>{{cite web | url = http://www.dartharbour.org/harbour-river-guide/river-trips/ | title = River Trips | publisher = Dart Harbour & Navigation Authority | accessdate = 2008-09-25 }}</ref><ref name=rvltt>{{cite web | url = http://www.riverlink.co.uk/PDF/TimeTable2008.pdf | title = Time Table 2008 | publisher = Dart Pleasure Craft Limited | accessdate = 2008-09-18 | format = PDF }}</ref>

The harbour and port are popular leisure boating locations, and several [[marina]]s and [[boat yard]]s are located on the river. The [[Port of Dartmouth Royal Regatta]] takes place annually over three days at the end of August.

==Canoeing and kayaking==
[[File:NewbridgeRiverDart.jpg|thumb|right|Kayakers playing on a wave under Newbridge]]
The upper reaches of [[Dartmoor]], especially those on the Dart, are a focal point for [[whitewater kayaking|whitewater kayakers]] and [[canoeists]]. The best known sections of the river are:
* ''[[Upper Dart]]'' from [[Dartmeet]] to [[Newbridge, River Dart|Newbridge]] ([[International Scale of River Difficulty|Grade]] 3/4 (higher in high water), advanced run).<ref>[http://www.ukriversguidebook.co.uk/swengland/dart.htm UK Rivers Guidebook, River Dart, Upper]</ref>
* ''[[The Loop, River Dart|The Loop]]'' from Newbridge to [[Holne Bridge]] (Grade 2/3, beginner/intermediate run).<ref>[http://www.ukriversguidebook.co.uk/swengland/dart.htm UK Rivers Guidebook, River Dart, Loop]</ref>
* ''[[The Lower, River Dart|The Lower]]'' from Holne Bridge to [[Buckfastleigh]] (Grade 2, beginner section).<ref>[http://www.ukriversguidebook.co.uk/swengland/lowerdart.htm UK Rivers Guidebook, River Dart, Lower]</ref>
Sections of the East and West Dart above Dartmeet, as well as the [[River Webburn|Webburn]] are also paddled when conditions permit. This is somewhat controversial, as riparian landowners and those responsible for local fisheries maintain that the East and West Dart should not be paddled.

The lower reaches of the Dart, including the estuary are suitable for flat water touring.

==Angling==
Angling is very popular in the Dart Valley. The [[West Dart]] is notable ground for [[salmon]] spawning [[redds]].

==Literature and folklore==
[[File:River Dart Weir at Totnes.jpg|right|thumb|220px|The weir at Totnes]]
The River Dart is the source of much [[folklore]] on Dartmoor, where it is traditionally respected and feared - the waters have a tendency to rise without notice following heavy rainfall on the moors above, adding to the dangers of its rapids and powerful currents. This gave rise to the couplet:

:"River of Dart, Oh River of Dart!
:Every year thou claimest a heart."

The 1951 non-fiction book ''The River Dart'' by [[Ruth Manning-Sanders]] centres on the river and its history.

The English poet [[Alice Oswald]] wrote the 48-page poem ''Dart'' (2002), which was awarded the [[T. S. Eliot Prize]] for 2002.  The poem's voice is that of the River Dart, which Oswald adapted from three years of recorded conversations and research with people who inhabit the communities along the river.

The Weaver Twins from [[Stoke Gabriel]] wrote a song entitled, "[http://www.radiocarolinetv.co.uk/#/weaver-twins/4533492985 Dart]". The music video was filmed along the river and has been featured on [[Radio Caroline]] television.
