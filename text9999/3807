'''Interstate 805''' ('''I-805''') is a major north<U+2013>south [[Interstate Highway System|Interstate Highway]] in [[Southern California]]. It is a [[bypass (road)|bypass]] of [[Interstate 5 in California|I-5]], running along the eastern areas of the [[San Diego<U+2013>Tijuana metropolitan area|Greater San Diego area]] from [[San Ysidro, San Diego, California|San Ysidro]] near the [[Mexico <U+2013> United States border|Mexico<U+2013>U.S. border]] to near [[Del Mar, California|Del Mar]]. The southern terminus of I-805 at I-5 in San Ysidro is less than a mile north of the Mexican border. I-805 then traverses through the cities of [[Chula Vista, California|Chula Vista]] and [[National City, California|National City]] before reentering San Diego. The freeway then passes though the San Diego neighborhoods of [[North Park, San Diego, California|North Park]], [[Mission Valley, California|Mission Valley]], [[Clairemont, San Diego, California|Clairemont]], and [[University City, San Diego, California|University City]] before terminating at I-5 in the [[Sorrento Valley, San Diego, California|Sorrento Valley]] neighborhood near the Del Mar city limit.

Planning for I-805 began in 1956, and the route was officially designated in the [[1964 state highway renumbering (California)|1964 state highway renumbering]]. Starting in 1967, the freeway was built in phases, with the northern part of the freeway finished before the southern part. I-805 was completed and open to traffic in 1975. Named the '''Jacob Dekema Freeway''' after the longtime head of the regional division of the [[California Department of Transportation]] (Caltrans), I-805 has been frequently cited for its complex engineering and architecture, including near I-8 on the '''Mission Valley Viaduct'''. Since then, several construction projects have taken place, including the construction of a "dual freeway" at the northern interchange with I-5. [[High-occupancy toll]] lanes are under construction on both the northern and southern portions of the route.

==Route description==
[[File:I-805 Northbound at CA 905.jpg|thumb|left|I-805 northbound at SR 905]]
The route begins at [[Interstate 5 in California|I-5]] near the [[Mexico|Mexican]] border in a far south part of [[San Ysidro, San Diego, California|San Ysidro]], a neighborhood of [[San Diego, California|San Diego]]. As it begins its journey northward, it quickly interchanges with [[California State Route 905|State Route 905]] (SR&nbsp;905) before exiting the city and entering [[Chula Vista, California|Chula Vista]]. In this city, it has interchanges with various arterial roads.<ref name="gmaps" /> In&nbsp;2004, the ''[[San Diego Union-Tribune]]'' examined the apparent divide between rich and poor in the city of Chula Vista that seemed to be delineated by I-805; those on the eastern side of the freeway were more affluent and had better schools compared to those on the western side.<ref>{{cite news | title=A city divided - by interstate 805 - Chula Vista, and its schools, face serious threat of east versus west | work=San Diego Union-Tribune | date=February 7, 2004 | author=Moran, Chris | page=B1|oclc=25257675}}</ref> Just outside the city, I-805 meets [[County Route S17 (California)|County Route S17]] (CR&nbsp;S17), also known as Bonita Road, before interchanging with [[California State Route 54|SR 54]]. The freeway then enters [[National City, California|National City]], where it intersects Sweetwater Road and Plaza Boulevard, before leaving the city and reentering the city of San Diego.<ref name="gmaps">{{google maps|url=https://maps.google.com/?ll=32.775729,-117.03186&spn=0.587715,1.215363&t=m&z=10|title=I-805|accessdate=September 14, 2013}}</ref>

It then continues northward through the city of San Diego, where it intersects [[California State Route 94|SR 94]], also known as the Martin Luther King Jr. Freeway. As it continues through downtown San Diego, it meets [[California State Route 15|SR 15]], the continuation of [[Interstate 15|I-15]]. It then intersects [[El Cajon Boulevard]] before passing under the Hazard Memorial Bridge that carries Adams Avenue and going over Mission Valley.<ref name="gmaps" /> The bridge was named after Roscoe Hazard for his involvement in the construction of several roads and highways in [[Southern California]]. I-805 then travels on the Mission Valley Viaduct, a towering [[reinforced concrete|reinforced]] [[concrete viaduct]] built in 1972, spanning over [[Mission Valley, San Diego, California|Mission Valley]] and the [[San Diego River]].<ref name="Caltrans">{{cite web |title=2008 Named Freeways, Highways, Structures and Other Appurtenances In California |work= |publisher=State of California Business, Transportation and Housing Agency, Department of Transportation (CalTrans) |date=January 2008 |url=http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/tsip/hseb/products/Named_Freeways.pdf |pages=70, 85, 172 |doi= |accessdate=September 13, 2013}}</ref> The viaduct is the top stack of the Jack Schrade Interchange over [[Interstate 8 (California)|Interstate 8]], which runs along the south side of Mission Valley and crosses underneath the viaduct perpendicularly, and is San Diego County's only symmetrical [[stack interchange]].

[[File:Interstate 805-5 Split.jpg|thumb|right|The beginning of I-805 south at I-5 during the evening rush hour]]
I-805 then meets [[California State Route 163|SR 163]], also known as the Cabrillo Freeway. It continues through suburban San Diego, where it meets [[California State Route 52|SR 52]] in [[Clairemont, San Diego, California|Clairemont Mesa]]. North of SR&nbsp;52, it closely parallels [[Interstate 5 in California|Interstate 5]] near [[La Jolla, California|La Jolla]], heading northwest. Passing under the Eastgate Mall arch bridge and entering [[Sorrento Valley, San Diego, California|Sorrento Valley]], it finally meets its north end at [[Interstate 5 in California|I-5]].<ref name="gmaps" /> I-5 at the I-805 merge was known as the widest freeway in the [[Interstate Highway System]] in 2007, with 21&nbsp;lanes.<ref name="newlanes">{{cite news | url=http://www.utsandiego.com/uniontrib/20070328/news_1mi28merge.html | title=Four new southbound lanes at I-5/805 merge set to open | work=San Diego Union-Tribune | date=March 28, 2007 | accessdate=September 13, 2013 | author=Schmidt, Steve|page=NC1|oclc=25257675}}</ref> Eastbound [[California State Route 56|SR 56]] and Carmel Mountain Road are accessible via a parallel [[carriageway]] for local traffic heading northbound from I-805; traffic from SR 56 westbound can merge onto I-805 from the local bypass.<ref name="gmaps" />

===Recognition, artwork, and architecture===
[[Image:Miramar op 805.jpg|thumb|left|The Miramar Road overpass on I-805 northbound, with the Eastgate Mall bridge in the background]]
The Mission Valley Viaduct was recognized by the ASCE as the "Outstanding Civil Engineering Project for 1973 in the San Diego Area"; it was designed to match the close-by [[Mission San Diego de Alcala]] with its columns that look similar to cathedral windows,<ref name="spectrum" /> with arch-like shapes etched into the textured concrete. The viaduct was designed to span {{convert|3900|ft|m}}, and use squared-off support columns instead of traditional cylindrical supports. Octagonal columns were to be used on the ramps and the ends of the bridge.<ref>{{cite news | title=Bids Due Soon For Viaduct In Mission Valley | work=The San Diego Union | date=August 11, 1968 | author=Smith, Cliff | page=B1|oclc=13155544}}</ref> Over 600&nbsp;tons of steel bars were to be used,<ref>{{cite news | title=Viaduct Takes Shape | work=The San Diego Union | date=August 7, 1969 | author=Staff | page=A28|oclc=13155544}}</ref> and the bridge was constructed as high as {{convert|98|ft|m}} above I-8.<ref>{{cite news | title=Interstate 805 Span Shows Geometric Beauty | work=The San Diego Union | date=August 24, 1970 | author=Staff | page=A3|oclc=13155544}}</ref> The Adams Avenue Bridge over I-805 was also recognized for its {{convert|439|ft|m}} span and two tapered supports on the ends of the bridge; in 1968, a [[Princeton University]] engineering professor asked for a copy of the design from Caltrans for educational purposes.<ref name="spectrum">{{cite news | title=Bridges Span Design Spectrum | work=The San Diego Union | date=January 11, 1976 | author=Staff | page=F6|oclc=13155544}}</ref> The construction supervisor, in fact, compared the construction of this bridge to building a boat, and it was constructed from the middle outward rather than the conventional method of building from the ends inward.

Awards for the Eastgate Mall (or Old Miramar Bridge) came from the [[Federal Highway Administration]], San Diego Highway Development Association, and Prestressed Concrete Institute Awards Program; at the time, it was one of the first arch bridges in the state, and did not use traditional concrete pillars.<ref name="spectrum" /> The ''San Diego Union'' (predecessor to the ''Union-Tribune'') published a few freelance articles in 1984 about I-805, complimenting the four-level interchange with I-8 and the [[arch bridge]] at Eastgate Mall, while mentioning that subsequent inflation after their completion would have made such structures more difficult to build if they had been constructed later. Other artwork and architecture that was mentioned included the Wateridge development in Sorrento Valley, and the "Stargazer" by Alexander Liberman that was lit with florescent colors at night.<ref>{{cite news | title=Outdoor artworks bring new beauty to freeway travel | work=The San Diego Union | date=August 16, 1984 | author=Lewinson, David | page=E8|oclc=13155544}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title=Architecture at its best in S.D freeways | work=The San Diego Union | date=February 26, 1984 | author=Jones, Bob | page=F1|oclc=13155544}}</ref>

However, not all forms of artwork along the highway were uncontroversial. In 1977, there were several complaints regarding new billboards that were installed at the northern terminus of the highway, since they blocked the view of the coast.<ref>{{cite news | title=Ruling Awaited On New Billboards On Interstate 805 | work=The San Diego Union | date=January 30, 1977 | author=Ball, Neil | page=B16|oclc=13155544}}</ref> In 1981, an illegal mural that was determined to be incomplete was discovered at the I-8 interchange; while Caltrans discouraged the painting of such murals, they were impressed with the portion that had already been completed.<ref>{{cite news | title=I-805 Graffiti Artist Sought | work=The San Diego Union | date=April 2, 1981 | author=Gross, Greg | page=B1|oclc=13155544}}</ref> Art Cole, the artist, stepped forward to the department, and was allowed to finish the mural of a desert highland sunrise; following this, Caltrans made efforts to have other murals commissioned.<ref>{{cite news | title=Mural Is Given To San Diego | work=The San Diego Union | date=August 28, 1981 | author=Staff | page=B13|oclc=13155544}}</ref>

===Expansion===
The construction of a "dual freeway" at the northern end was discussed as early as 1989, referring to the two [[carriageways]] needed for each direction of the freeway. It would require drivers to use the new local lanes to access eastbound SR&nbsp;56 from I-5 or [[I-805 (CA)|I-805]]. The project would allow for trucks to use the new lanes to assist in merging with traffic. However, it faced opposition from local residents, concerned about the loss of the view from their homes, as well as environmentalists concerned about nearby wetlands.<ref>{{cite news | title=Bottleneck at I-5/805 is dilemma | work=The San Diego Union | date=April 30, 1989 | author=Weisberg, Lori | page=B1|oclc=13155544}}</ref> Further objections espoused the view that the congestion would continue to increase, regardless of what was done, and that the new road would be at capacity in a few years.<ref>{{cite news | title=Residents express anguish at plans to expand I-5 junction | work=Evening Tribune | date=June 2, 1989 | author=Kubik, Agnes | location=San Diego | page=B8|oclc=37687666}}</ref> SANDAG funded the construction with $110 million (about ${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US-NGDPPC|110000000|2000|r=3}}}} {{as of|2011|alt=in 2011 dollars}}){{Inflation-fn|US-NGDPPC}} in mid-2000.<ref>{{cite news | title=Highways receive bulk of money in SANDAG transportation plan | work=San Diego Union-Tribune | date=July 22, 2000 | author=Arner, Mark | page=B3|oclc=25257675}}</ref>

Construction of the "dual freeway" began in early 2002, at a cost of $182&nbsp;million<ref>{{cite news | title=I-5/805 merge widening under way | work=The San Diego Union-Tribune | date=March 1, 2002 | last=LaRue | first=Steve | page=B2| oclc=25257675}}</ref> (about ${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US-NGDPPC|182000000|2002|r=3}}}} {{as of|2011|alt=in 2011 dollars}}){{Inflation-fn|US-NGDPPC}} The northbound lanes were scheduled to open in February&nbsp;2006.<ref>{{cite news | title=Showers push back opening of bypass | work=The San Diego Union-Tribune | date=February 19, 2006 | author=Staff | page=B3| oclc=25257675}}</ref> The southbound lanes were completed in early 2007.<ref name="newlanes" /> That year, a three-year project began to allow [[Driverless car|robot controlled vehicles]], including buses and trucks, to use a special lane.  The intention is to allow the vehicles to travel at shorter following distances and thereby allow more vehicles to use the lanes.  The vehicles will still have drivers since they need to enter and exit the special lanes. The system was designed by Swoop Technology, based in San Diego County.<ref name="RoboBus">{{cite news | url=http://www.wired.com/cars/futuretransport/magazine/15-08/st_robot | title=Robot Buses Pull In to San Diego's Fastest Lane | publisher=Wired | date=July 24, 2007 | accessdate=August 19, 2007|oclc=24479723}}</ref>
