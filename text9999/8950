== Background ==
The formation of political groups in the 19th century in divided Italy is based on personalities, like [[Count Camillo Benso di Cavour|Camillo di Cavour]] and [[Giuseppe Mazzini]]. Both the Historical Right (''Destra Storica'') and the Historical Left (''Sinistra Storica'') were composed of [[monarchism|monarchist]] liberals, while radicals organised themselves as the [[Radical Party (Italy, 1877)|Radical Party]] and republicans as the [[Italian Republican Party]]. Only in the 1920s, the Liberals around [[Giovanni Giolitti]] formed their party, the precursor of the [[Italian Liberal Party]]. After the end of [[World War II]] both Liberals and Republicans reorganised themselves, followed by more liberal parties in the upcoming decades.

Liberalism was strongly divided after the shake up of Italian politics, following the ''[[Tangentopoli]]'' scandal and the subsequent ''[[Mani Pulite]]''. Nowadays a broad group of parties, not all included, tend to use the label liberal. Liberals are now divided over the [[centre-right]] [[The People of Freedom]] (the [[Berlusconi|Silvio Berlusconi]]-led successor of [[Forza Italia]], itself primarily a merger of liberal and Christian-democratic forces) and the [[centre-left]] [[Democratic Party (Italy)|Democratic Party]] (a merger of social democrats, progressive Christian democrats and social-liberals). Then there are some minor liberal parties: the formerly centre-left - nowadays centre-right - [[Italian Republican Party]] (former [[European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party|ELDR]] member) and the [[Italian Radicals]] ([[European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party|ELDR]] and [[Liberal International]]).

Also the populist-centrist [[Italy of Values]] is a member of [[European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party|ELDR]], although it is very difficult to classify it as a liberal party in whichever sense.

Most members of the late [[Italian Liberal Party]] (refounded as a very small party in 2004, see [[Italian Liberal Party (2004)]]) and many former [[Italian Republican Party|Republicans]] joined Forza Italia, which was often presented and defined in Italy as a liberal party, and the other parties of the [[House of Freedoms]] coalition. This is the reason why the term 'liberals' is more often used when speaking of the centre-right, now dominated by Forza Italia successor party [[The People of Freedom]], which tries to combine [[economic liberalism]] with freedom of conscience on ethical matters.
