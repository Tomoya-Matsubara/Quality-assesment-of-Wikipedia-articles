== History ==
=== Early history ===
[[Image:CNN Launch June 1, 1980.jpg|thumb|right|CNN's first broadcast with [[David Walker (journalist)|David Walker]] and [[Lois Hart]] on June 1, 1980.]]{{Main|History of CNN: 1980-2003}}
The Cable News Network was launched at 5:00 p.m. EST on Sunday June 1, 1980.  After an introduction by Ted Turner, the husband and wife team of [[David Walker (journalist)|David Walker]] and [[Lois Hart]] anchored the first newscast.<ref>{{cite book|title=American Television News: The Media Marketplace and the Public Interest|first=Steve Michael|last=Barkin|first2=M.E. |last2=Sharpe|year=2003}}</ref> Since its debut, CNN has expanded its reach to a number of cable and satellite television networks, several web sites, specialized closed-circuit networks (such as [[CNN Airport Network]]), and a [[radio]] network. The network has 36 bureaus (10 domestic, 26 international), more than 900 affiliated local stations, and several regional and foreign-language networks around the world. The network's success made a bona-fide mogul of founder Ted Turner and set the stage for the Time Warner conglomerate's eventual acquisition of [[Turner Broadcasting]].

A companion network, [[HLN (TV channel)|CNN2]], was launched on January 1, 1982 and featured a continuous 24-hour cycle of 30-minute news broadcasts. A year later, it changed its name to "CNN Headline News", and eventually it was simply called "Headline News". (In 2005, Headline News would break from its original format with the addition of ''[[Headline Prime]]'', a prime-time programming block that features news commentary; and in 2008 the channel changed its name again, to "HLN".)

=== Recent years ===
<!-- {{main|History of CNN: 2004-Present}} -->
In 2004, [[Jonathan Klein (CNN)|Jonathan Klein]] took over CNN as president and has maintained the position ever since. CNN HD was launched September 1, 2007, and was first nationally distributed by DirecTV on September 26, 2007. The network has also faced an increasingly competitive media environment; since CNN's debut, more than 70 television networks have launched with 24-hour news coverage.<ref name=CNNtaipei/>

===Major events===
[[Image:CNN Center newsroom1.jpg|thumb|right|Replica of the newsroom at CNN Center.]]
====Challenger disaster====
On January 28, 1986, CNN was the only television network to have live coverage of the launch and explosion of [[Space Shuttle Challenger]].  The shuttle exploded after lift-off killing seven crew members including [[Christa McAuliffe]], a high school teacher from [[Concord, New Hampshire]] to be the first teacher in space.  Then-President [[Ronald Reagan]] postponed his [[State of the Union Address]] that evening.  He addressed the nation from the Oval Office.

====Baby Jessica rescue====
On October 14, 1987, an 18-month-old toddler named [[Jessica McClure]] fell down a well in [[Midland, Texas]]. CNN was quickly on the spot, and the event helped make their name. The ''[[New York Times]]'' ran a retrospective article in 1995 on the impact of live video news. "If a picture is worth a thousand words, then a moving picture is worth many times that, and a live moving picture makes an emotional connection that goes deeper than logic and lasts well beyond the actual event. This was before correspondents reported live from the enemy capital while American bombs were falling. Before Saddam Hussein held a surreal press conference with a few of the hundreds of Americans he was holding hostage. Before the nation watched, riveted but powerless, as Los Angeles was looted and burned. Before O. J. Simpson took a slow ride in a white Bronco, and before everyone close to his case had an agent and a book contract. This was uncharted territory just a short time ago."<ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE3D81F31F930A15754C0A963958260&sec=health&spon=&pagewanted=4 "Death on the CNN curve" By Lisa Belkin. ''New York Times'' Magazine, Sunday, July 23, 1995.]</ref>

====The Gulf War====
The first Persian [[Gulf War]] in 1991 was a watershed event for CNN that catapulted the network past the "big three" American networks for the first time in its history, largely due to an unprecedented, historical scoop: CNN was the only news outlet with the ability to communicate from inside [[Iraq]] during the initial hours of the Coalition bombing campaign, with live reports from the [[al-Rashid Hotel]] in [[Baghdad]] by reporters [[Bernard Shaw (journalist)|Bernard Shaw]], [[John Holliman]], and [[Peter Arnett]]. 

[[Image:CNN Gulf War nightscope January 1991.jpg|thumb|right|[[Operation Desert Storm]] as captured live on a CNN [[night vision]] camera with reporters narrating.]] <U+200E>
The moment when bombing began was announced on CNN by Bernard Shaw on January 16, 1991 as follows:<ref>[http://www.yale.edu/ynhti/curriculum/units/1996/2/96.02.08.x.html The Gulf War and its Consequences]</ref>

{{cquote|This is Bernie Shaw. Something is happening outside...Peter Arnett, join me here. Let's describe to our viewers what we're seeing...The skies over Baghdad have been illuminated...We're seeing bright flashes going off all over the sky.}}

The Gulf War experience brought CNN some much sought-after legitimacy and made household names of previously obscure (and infamously low-paid) reporters. Many of these reporters now comprise CNN's "old guard." Bernard Shaw became CNN's chief anchor until his retirement in 2001. Others include then-Pentagon correspondent [[Wolf Blitzer]] (now host of ''[[The Situation Room]]'') and international correspondent [[Christiane Amanpour]]. Amanpour's presence in Iraq was caricatured by actress Nora Dunn as the ruthless reporter "Adriana Cruz" in the film ''[[Three Kings (film)|Three Kings]]'' (1999). Time Warner later produced a [[television movie]], ''[[Live from Baghdad]]'', about the network's coverage of the first Gulf War, which aired on [[Home Box Office|HBO]].

=====The CNN effect=====
Coverage of the first Gulf War and other crises of the early 1990s (particularly the infamous [[Battle of Mogadishu (1993)|Battle of Mogadishu]]) led officials at the Pentagon to coin the term "the [[CNN effect]]" to describe the perceived impact of [[Real-time computing|real time]], 24-hour news coverage on the decision-making processes of the [[Federal government of the United States|American government]].

==== September 11 ====
[[Image:CNN Breaking News 911.jpg|thumb|CNN breaking the news about the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]].]]
CNN was the first network to break the news of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11 attacks]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pressdemocrat.com/article/20080720/ENTERTAINMENT/917997689?Title=No-nonsense-news-returns-to-CNN |title=No-nonsense news returns to CNN |publisher=PressDemocrat.com |date= |accessdate=2010-02-20}}</ref> [[News presenter|Anchor]] [[Carol Lin]] was on the air to deliver the first public report of the event. She broke into a commercial at 8:49 a.m. ET and said:

{{cquote|This just in. You are looking at obviously a very disturbing live shot there. That is the [[World Trade Center]], and we have unconfirmed reports this morning that a plane has crashed into one of the towers of the World Trade Center. [[CNN Center]] right now is just beginning to work on this story, obviously calling our sources and trying to figure out exactly what happened, but clearly something relatively devastating happening this morning there on the south end of the island of Manhattan. That is once again, a picture of one of the towers of the World Trade Center.}}

[[Daryn Kagan]] and [[Leon Harris]] were live on the air just after 9 a.m. ET as the second plane hit the World Trade Center and through an interview with CNN correspondent [[David Ensor]], reported the news that U.S. officials determined "that this is a terrorist act."<ref>[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0109/11/bn.01.html CNN BREAKING NEWS Transcript <U+2013> Terrorist Attack on United States]</ref>  Later, [[Aaron Brown]] anchored through the day and night as the attacks unfolded. Brown had just come to CNN from [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] to be the breaking news anchor.

[[Sean Murtagh]], CNN vice-president for finance and administration, was the first network employee on the air in New York.<ref>CNN.com (September 11, 2001) Available at [http://web.archive.org/web/20010911200318/http://www.cnn.com/ archive.org]. Retrieved 2007-06-18.</ref>

Coincidentally, September 11, 2001 was [[Paula Zahn|Paula Zahn's]] first day as a CNN reporter. She mentioned this as a guest clue presenter on a 2005 episode of ''[[Jeopardy!]]''.

====2008 U.S. election====
[[Image:CNN-YouTube Republican Debate.jpg|thumb|right|The stage for the second 2008 [[CNN-YouTube presidential debates|CNN-YouTube presidential debate]].]]
Leading up to the [[2008 U.S. presidential election]], CNN devoted large amounts of coverage to politics, including hosting candidate debates during the Democratic and Republican primary seasons. On June 3 and June 5, CNN teamed up with [[Saint Anselm College]] to sponsor the New Hampshire Republican and Democratic Debates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~action/2008/primdeb08/nh060307.html |title=CNN/WMUR-TV/New Hampshire Union Leader Democratic Debate |publisher=Gwu.edu |date=2007-06-03 |accessdate=2010-02-20}}</ref> Later in 2007, the network hosted the first [[CNN-YouTube presidential debates]], a non-traditional format where viewers were invited to pre-submit questions over the internet via the [[YouTube]] video-sharing service.<ref>[http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/07/22/news/youtube23.php YouTube and CNN invite ordinary Americans into presidential debates]</ref>  In 2008, CNN partnered with ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'' to host two primary debates leading up to its coverage of [[Super Tuesday]].<ref name=supertuesday>[http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-et-politics4feb04,0,6879163.story Super Tuesday gets presidential treatment]</ref>  CNN's debate and election night coverage led to its highest ratings of the year, with January 2008 viewership averaging 1.1 million viewers, a 41% increase over the previous year.<ref name=supertuesday/>

===On-air presentation===
In December 2008, CNN introduced its new graphics package, a comprehensive redesign replacing the existing style that had been used since 2004.<ref name=CNNnewlook>{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/160701-CNN_Gets_New_Graphic_Look.php|title=CNN Gets New Graphic Look|date=2008-12-15|publisher=''Broadcasting & Cable''|last=Dickson |first=Glen|accessdate=2009-01-24}}</ref>  The design replaced the scrolling ticker that had been in use since 2001. Also, since March 1, 2009, the redundant CNN HD logo has been missing from the bottom left corner of the screen. CNN's new graphic design is similar to its sister network, [[CNN International]].

[[Image:CNN HD-American Morning 1080.png|right|thumb|American Morning on CNN HD with the 2004<U+2013>2008 graphics package.]]
'''CNN HD''' is a [[1080i]] [[high definition television|high definition]] simulcast of CNN that launched in September 2007.<ref name=hdlaunch>[http://www.tvweek.com/news/2007/09/cnn_hd_debuts.php TV Week September 6, 2007 CNN HD Debuts]</ref> All regular shows based out of New York City, Washington, D.C. and Los Angeles are aired in HD, as well as special events. Shows based out of Atlanta are not in HD (they are instead aired in [[Stretch-o-Vision]]) but CNN has announced they will begin airing in HD in April or May of 2010.<ref>[http://www.multichannel.com/article/450206-CNN_Going_All_HD_By_Late_Spring.php CNN Going All-HD By Late Spring <U+2013> Atlanta Studio to Go on the Air in April or May] ''Multichannel News'' March 15, 2010</ref>  [[Pillarbox#Stylized pillarboxing on television|Stylized pillarboxes]] (outlines of the letters "HD" in a large font, configured sideways, and usually in red with a red background, but sometimes blue with a blue background), are used for remotely shot video that's only available in standard definition.

Formerly during ''American Morning'', CNN HD viewers saw weather forecasts in graphic form on the sides of the screen (American cities on the right, and cities outside of the U.S. on the left). This feature was removed in November 2009.

The documentary ''[[Planet in Peril]]'' was CNN's first documentary program produced in HD, followed by ''[[Black in America]]'' (Its sequel ''Black in America 2'' also aired in HD). Its spinoff ''[[Latino in America]]'' was also in HD. CNN HD also used to display a CNN HD logo (the normal CNN logo with the letters HD in a different, gray colored font next to it) on the bottom left corner of the screen. It was last used on February 28, 2009. 

===Special events===
All special events are aired in full HD. During primary and caucus nights, America Votes 2008 was produced in complete HD with Wolf Blitzer anchoring from CNN's main New York studio which was renamed the CNN Election Center. During this time, CNN HD viewers got additional information on the side of their TV screens such as poll numbers, charts and graphs. This also happened for the [[2008 Democratic National Convention]], the [[2008 Republican National Convention]], the [[United States presidential election debates, 2008|2008 United States Presidential Debates]], the [[United States vice-presidential debate, 2008|2008 United States Vice Presidential Debate]] and the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 Election Day]] coverage on November 4, all of which were also shot in HD. The [[Barack Obama 2009 presidential inauguration|2009 United States Presidential Inauguration Day]] coverage on January 20 was also shot in full HD. President [[Barack Obama]]'s first prime-time press conference on February 9, 2009 was also aired in full HD, as well as his address to a joint session of Congress on February 24, and his second prime-time press conference on March 24, and his [[Barack Obama speech to joint session of Congress, September 2009|address to a joint session of Congress on September 9, 2009]], his [[2010 State of the Union Address|First State of the Union Address]] on January 27, 2010 and his Health Care Summit on February 25, 2010.

[[Image:CNN Election Express.jpg|thumb|right|The CNN Election Express bus, used for HD broadcasts.]]
CNN's political coverage in HD was given mobility by the introduction of the CNN Election Express bus in October 2007.  The Election Express vehicle, capable of five simultaneous HD feeds, was used for the network's CNN-YouTube presidential debates and for presidential candidate interviews.<ref>[http://www.tvtechnology.com/article/17920 CNN Rolls Out Election Express]</ref>

[[File:New CNN Website 2009-10-25.png|thumb|left|New CNN website, unveiled October 24, 2009]]

CNN debuted its news website [http://www.cnn.com/ CNN.com] (initially an experiment known as ''CNN Interactive'') on August 30, 1995. The site attracted growing interest over its first decade and is now one of the most popular news websites in the world. The widespread growth of [[blogs]], [[social media]] and [[user-generated content]] have influenced the site, and blogs in particular have focused CNN's previously scattershot online offerings, most noticeably in the development and launch of [[CNN Pipeline]] in late 2005.

In April 2009, CNN.com ranked third place among online global news sites in unique users in the U.S., after [[msnbc.com]] and [[Yahoo! News]], according to Nielsen/NetRatings; with an increase of 11% over the previous year.<ref>[http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003975048 Top 30 global news sites for April <U+2013> Editor & Publisher]</ref>

[[Image:Cnnreport.JPG|thumb|right|Citizen journalist video submitted to CNN's iReport.com.]]
[[CNN Pipeline]] was the name of a paid subscription service, its corresponding website, and a content delivery client that provided streams of live video from up to four sources (or "pipes"), on-demand access to CNN stories and reports, and optional pop-up "news alerts" to computer users.  The installable client was available to users of PCs running [[Microsoft Windows]]. There was also a browser-based "web client" that did not require installation. In July 2007 the service was discontinued and replaced with a free streaming service.

The now-defunct topical news-program ''[[Judy Woodruff's Inside Politics]]'' was the first CNN program to feature a round-up of blogs in 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/columnist/mediamix/2005-03-20-media-mix_x.htm|title=It's prime time for blogs on CNN's 'Inside Politics'|date=2005-03-20|publisher=USA Today|last=Johnson|first=Peter|accessdate=2009-01-24}}</ref> Blog coverage was expanded when ''[[Inside Politics]]'' was folded into ''[[The Situation Room]]''. In 2006 CNN launched [[CNN Exchange]] and [[CNN iReport]], initiatives designed to further introduce and centralize the impact of everything from [[blogging]] to [[citizen journalism]] within the CNN brand. [[CNN iReport]] which features user-submitted photos and video, has achieved considerable traction, with increasingly professional-looking reports filed by amateur journalists, many still in high school or college. The iReport gained more prominence when observers of the Virginia Tech Shootings sent-in first hand photos of what was going during the shootings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/reginaleaderpost/news/story.html?id=250570b8-2555-4ac0-8fb7-a0431a321e0d&k=80562|title='Citizen journalist' often there first to snap photos|date=April 12, 2008|publisher=''Regina Leader-Post''|last=Cobb|first=Chris|accessdate=2009-01-24}}</ref>

As of early 2008, CNN maintains a free live broadcast.<ref name="CNNlivestreaming">{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/video/live/live.html|title=CNN live streaming website}}</ref> CNN International is broadcasted live, as part of the [[RealNetworks]] SuperPass subscription outside US. CNN also offers several [[RSS|RSS feeds]] and [[podcast]]s.

On April 18, 2008 CNN.com was targeted by Chinese hackers in retaliation for the network's coverage on the [[2008 Tibetan unrest]]. CNN reported that they took preventative measures after news broke of the impending attack.<ref>"[http://www.cnn.com/2008/TECH/04/18/cnn.websites/ CNN website targeted]", April 18, 2008</ref><ref>Claburn, Thomas: "[http://www.informationweek.com/news/security/cybercrime/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=207400699 CNN Faces Cyberattack Over Tibet Coverage]" [[InformationWeek]], 2008</ref>

The company was honored at the 2008 [[Technology & Engineering Emmy Award]]s for development and implementation of an integrated and portable IP-based live, edit and store-and-forward digital newsgathering system.

On October 24, 2009 CNN launched a new version of their CNN.com website, revamping it adding a new "sign up" option where users may create their own user name, a new "CNN Pulse" (beta) feature along with a new red color theme.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/interactive/relaunch/ |title=Welcome to the New CNN.com <U+2013> Interactive tour |publisher=Cnn.com |date= |accessdate=2010-02-20}}</ref>

CNN also has a channel in the popular video-sharing site [[YouTube]], but its videos can only be viewed from the United States, which has drawn some criticism among YT users.

In April 2010, CNN announced via [[Twitter]] its upcoming food [[blog]] called "Eatocracy," in which it will "cover all news related to food <U+2013> from recalls to health issues to culture." <ref> {{ cite website |author=Brion, Raphael |title=Eatocracy: CNN Gets in the Food Blog Business |url=http://eater.com/archives/2010/04/13/eatocracy-cnn-gets-in-the-food-blog-business.php |work=Eater.com |date=April 13, 2010 }} </ref>

== Controversy ==
{{Main|CNN controversies}}
In a joint study by the Joan Shorenstein Center on Press, Politics and Public Policy at [[Harvard University]] and the Project for Excellence in Journalism, the authors found disparate treatment by the three major cable networks of Republican and Democratic candidates during the earliest five months of presidential primaries in 2007: "The CNN programming studied tended to cast a negative light on Republican candidates<U+2014>by a margin of three-to-one. Four-in-ten stories (41%) were clearly negative while just 14% were positive and 46% were neutral. The network provided negative coverage of all three main candidates with McCain fairing the worst (63% negative) and Romney fairing a little better than the others only because a majority of his coverage was neutral. It's not that Democrats, other than Obama, fared well on CNN either. Nearly half of the Illinois Senator's stories were positive (46%), vs. just 8% that were negative. But both Clinton and Edwards ended up with more negative than positive coverage overall. So while coverage for Democrats overall was a bit more positive than negative, that was almost all due to extremely favorable coverage for Obama." <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hks.harvard.edu/presspol/publications/reports/invisible_primary_invisible_no_longer.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - The Early Campaign FINAL.doc |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-02-20}}</ref>

CNN has been accused of perpetrating [[media bias]] for allegedly promoting both a conservative and a liberal agenda based on previous incidents. [[Media Matters for America]] has documented several hundred separate instances of what it sees as conservative editorializing during CNN broadcasts.<ref>[http://mediamatters.org/search/tag/cnn Media Matters for America Results: Tagged with CNN], [[Media Matters for America]]</ref>  [[Accuracy in Media]] and the [[Media Research Center]] have claimed that CNN's reporting contains liberal editorializing within news stories.<ref>[http://www.aim.org/media_monitor/A3962_0_2_0_C/ CNN and the Liberal Propaganda Machine]</ref><ref>[http://www.mediaresearch.org/cyberalerts/1999/cyb19990217.asp Media Research Center CyberAlert <U+2013> 02/17/1999 <U+2013> slant of CNN's Tuesday night town meeting]</ref> 

CNN is one of the world's largest news organizations, and its international channel, [[CNN International]] is the leading international new channel in terms of viewer reach.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/about/ |title=About Us |publisher=CNN.com |date= |accessdate=2010-02-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brandrepublic.com/bulletins/media/article/563911/cnn-tops-european-news-channels-according-ems/ |title=CNN tops European news channels according to EMS <U+2013> Brand Republic News |publisher=Brand Republic |date= |accessdate=2010-02-20}}</ref> Unlike the BBC and its network of reporters and bureaus, [[CNN International]] makes extensive use of affiliated reporters that are local to, and often directly affected by, the events they are reporting. The effect is a more immediate, less detached style of on-the-ground coverage. This has done little to stem criticism, largely from Middle Eastern nations, that CNN International reports news from a pro-American perspective. This is a marked contrast to domestic criticisms that often portray CNN as having a "liberal" or "anti-American" bias. In 2002, [[Honest Reporting]] spearheaded a campaign to expose CNN for pro-Palestinian bias, citing public remarks in which [[Ted Turner]] equated Palestinian suicide bombing with Israeli military strikes.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2002/jun/18/terrorismandthemedia.israel CNN chief accuses Israel of terror]</ref>

''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]''. 5 June 2007. As said by Ted Turner, founder of CNN, "There really isn't much of a point getting some Tom, Dick or Harry off the streets to report on when we can snag a big name whom everyone identifies with. After all, it's all part of the business." However, in April 2008, Turner criticized the direction CNN has taken.<ref>[http://www.ajc.com/metro/content/news/stories/2008/04/03/turner_0404.html Ted Turner: Global warming could lead to cannibalism | ajc.com]</ref>

A Chinese website, [[Anti-cnn|anti-cnn.com]],<ref>[http://www.anti-cnn.com/ We Just Want the Truth! CNN:The world's leader of liars <U+897F><U+65B9><U+5A92><U+4F53><U+6C61><U+8511><U+4E2D><U+56FD><U+62A5><U+9053><U+5168><U+7EAA><U+5F55>Anti-CNN.com,Anti-BBC.com,Anti-VOA.com]</ref> has accused CNN and western media in general of biased reporting against China, with the catch-phrase "Don't be so CNN" catching on in the Chinese mainstream as jokingly meaning "Don't be so biased". Pictures used by CNN are allegedly edited to have completely different meanings from the original ones. In addition, the network was accused of largely ignoring pro-China voices during the Olympic Torch Relay in San Francisco. 

On April 24, 2008 beautician Liang Shubing and teacher Li Lilan sued commentator [[Jack Cafferty]] and CNN $1.3 billion damages ($1 per person in China), in New York, for "violating the dignity and reputation of the Chinese people". This was in response to an incident during CNN's "The Situation Room" on April 9, where Cafferty stated his opinion that "[the USA] continue to import their junk with the lead paint on them and the poisoned pet food" despite his view that "[the Chinese leaders were] basically the same bunch of goons and thugs they've been for the last 50 years". Further, amid China's Foreign Ministry demand for an apology, 14 lawyers filed a similar suit in Beijing.<ref>[http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/20080424/cnn-time-warner-lawsuit-china-media.htm ''IBtimes.com'', CNN Faces $1.3 Bln Lawsuit <U+2013> $1 per person in China]</ref><ref>[http://www.reuters.com/article/televisionNews/idUSPEK30866720080424 reuters.com, CNN now sued for $1.3 billion <U+2013> $1 per person in China]</ref>

*CNN has been [[parody|parodied]] many times.  Many movies outside of the Turner Broadcasting Network also mention CNN in their storylines.  Several television shows (i.e., ''[[Seven Days (TV series)|Seven Days]]'', ''[[JAG (TV series)|JAG]]'', and ''[[NCIS (TV series)|NCIS]]'') use a parody of CNN known as "[[ZNN]]". During the run of the series ''[[Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]]'', "LNN" was used to stand for the [[Lex Luthor|Luthor]] News Network. In the movie ''[[Mr Bones]]'' appears a news network with the name "CCN", its logo being in the same font as CNN's. In the video game ''[[Desert Strike: Return to the Gulf|Desert Strike]]'', the in-game news station is called "EANN", with the EA standing for the video game company's name, [[Electronic Arts]]. In ''[[The Flintstones (film)|The Flintstones]]'' Movie, a news reporter is seen reporting for a news network called [[Anno Domini|BC]]NN. The movie ''[[Batman Forever]]'' shows a newscast on "GNN" (presumably standing for Gotham News Network). The logo is very similar to the "CNN" logo. GNN also appears on the Nolan series of Batman films, and in the movie ''Vantage Point'' where its reporter is caught in the middle of an attack on the President in Spain.  Other parodies or references include ''[[Command & Conquer: Generals <U+2013> Zero Hour]]''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> American campaign, featuring updates on missions with a correspondent from BNN, the [[rapping|rapper]] [[Eminem]] included a similar alteration in his song "[[Without Me]]", where, dressed up as [[Osama Bin Laden]] he was reported on by ENN, derived from his name. Finally, the movie ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'' had its own version of CNN called "GCN". In the DVD, episodes of ''Gotham Tonight'' of the GCN network are found explaining events before the movie.
* CNN's most famous station ID is a five-second musical jingle with [[James Earl Jones]]' simple but classic line, ''"This is CNN."'' Jones' voice can still be heard today in updated station IDs. The line has also been referenced in other programming, including ''[[The Simpsons]]'' and ''[[Will & Grace]]'', where Jones himself says that it was his last good piece of work. The line was also referred as a sub-parody in the 2002 film ''[[Kung Pow! Enter the Fist]]'', during the ending of another sub-parody based on a scene from Disney's ''[[The Lion King]]'', where Jones himself is noted have voiced one of the main characters.
* Australian satirist group [[The Chaser]] produced 12 half-hour episodes of ''[[CNNNN]]'', a show that parodied the logo and slogan, with taglines such as "We report, you believe". The Chaser's work was shown on CNN in July 2007 after their [[APEC 2007]] stunt for their show ''[[The Chaser's War on Everything]]'' created considerable controversy.
