===Commonwealth Writers Prize===
"Established in 1987, the prize aims to recognise the best fiction by both established and new writers from Commonwealth countries and ensure these works reach a wider audience outside their countries of origin. Almost 200 books have now been recognised with prizes since the scheme
began. The Prize aims to discover and promote up-and-coming and under-recognised writers, encourage dialogue and understanding of different cultures through reading, and share compelling stories of human experience. Chaired by Hon Nicholas Hasluck AM, the Prize is fully international in
its character, administration and judging. Each year, prizes for Best Book and Best First Book are awarded in four regions: Africa, Caribbean and Canada, South Asia and Europe and South East Asia and Pacific. Eight regional winners then compete for the pan-Commonwealth Best Book and Best First Book prizes, of <U+00A3>10,000 and <U+00A3>5,000, awarded at a public programme held in a different Commonwealth country each year."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.commonwealthfoundation.com/Howwedeliver/Prizes/CommonwealthWritersPrize |title=Commonwealth Writers' Prize |publisher=Commonwealthfoundation.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-08}}</ref>

===Giller Prize===
"The Giller Prize was founded in 1994 by Jack Rabinovitch in honour of his late wife, literary journalist Doris Giller, who passed away from cancer the year before. The award recognized excellence in Canadian fiction - long format or short stories - and endowed a cash prize annually of $25,000.00, the largest purse for literature in the country. The launch of The Giller Prize coincided with a growing recognition of Canadian authors and literature both at home and abroad. With such acclaimed writers as Alice Munro, Margaret Atwood, Michael Ondaatje and Mordecai Richler winning honours and accolades around the world, the popularity of Canadian literature has continued to flourish. The Giller Prize, along with many other awards that came before and after, is in large part responsible for this explosion of talent and exposure. More than 2.5 million Giller-nominated books were sold in the first 10 years of the prize. Over $60 million dollars in book sales to date have been generated as a direct result of the prize. The Giller Prize has so far endowed nearly half a million dollars to Canadian writers from coast to coast."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scotiabankgillerprize.ca/theprize.html |title=Scotiabank Giller Prize &#124; The Prize |publisher=Scotiabankgillerprize.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-03-08}}</ref>

===The Leacock Prize===
"Close friends, colleagues and supporters of Stephen Leacock were the original members of the Leacock Associates (originally the Stephen Leacock Memorial Committee) when it was formed in 1946 under the guidance of Packet Editor, C. H. Hale. Membership was Orillia-based, but quickly spread through North America and England. The Association had three immediate objectives: to set up a collection in the Orillia Public Library of books, letters and personal items relating to the life and works of Stephen Leacock; to commission a bronze bust of Leacock by Elizabeth Wyn Wood, a famous Canadian sculptor and native of Orillia; and most notably to establish a memorial Medal to be awarded annually for the best book of humour written in the previous year by a Canadian.

The award has attained an international reputation and is the only award of its kind for Canadian humour.

Cash prizes to accompany the medal were offered beginning in the year 1970 in turn by the Manulife Insurance Company ($1,000) and by the Hudson's Bay Company ($1,500). In 1984, J. P. Wiser Distillers offered the J. P. Wiser cash award of $3,500 and in 1994, the Manulife Bank of Canada took over, offering a cash award of $5,000. In 1995, the Laurentian Bank of Canada became the award sponsor maintaining the cash award of $5,000 to the winner. This was increased to $10,000 for the year 2002. In 2004 the Laurentian Bank was purchased by Toronto Dominion, and the T.D. Financial Group took over sponsorship of the $10,000 cash award."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leacock.ca/MEDAL.htm |title=The Leacock Memorial Medal |publisher=Leacock.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-03-08}}</ref>

===IMPAC Dublin Literary Award===
