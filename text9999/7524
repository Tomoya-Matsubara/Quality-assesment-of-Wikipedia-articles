'''ExtendSim''' (formerly known as Extend) is a [[simulation software|simulation program]] for modeling [[discrete event simulation | discrete event]], [[continuous]], [[agent-based]], and discrete rate processes. There are four ExtendSim packages: CP for continuous processes; OR (operations research) which adds discrete event; AT (advanced technology) which adds discrete rate, a number of advanced modeling features , and [[Stat::Fit]] for statistical distribution fitting; and Suite which adds 3D animation.

==History==

{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|+
! Year !! Features added
|-
| 1987 || original release for continuous modeling on the Macintosh
|-
| 1990 || discrete event capabilities added
|-
| 1995 || release for Microsoft Windows
|-
| 2008 || discrete rate and 3D capabilities added
|}

==Model construction==
Models are created by dragging blocks from a library into a model worksheet. Blocks are connected together to create the logical flow of the model. Data for the model resides in the parameters of the blocks and in a proprietary [[database]]. New blocks can be created by combining existing blocks into a single hierarchical block or by programming a block in ExtendSim's [[c (programming language) | c-based]] language, ModL. The major libraries in ExtendSim are:

==Application areas==

ExtendSim is used for modeling manufacturing, healthcare, supply chain, communications, defense, environmental, agricultural, biological, energy, reliability, service, information flow, and recreational systems. Sample applications include resource optimization for food logistics <ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.ecology.kee.hu/pdf/0501_189200.pdf | title = Resource Optimization by Simulation Technique in Food Logistics | accessdate = 2011-02-11}}</ref>, [[six sigma]] process improvement for a hospital [[emergency department]] <ref> {{cite web | title = Simulating Six Sigma Improvement Ideas for a Hospital Emergency Department | url = http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc03papers/250.pdf | accessdate = 2011-02-11}} </ref>, communication systems <ref>{{cite web | title = NCW End-To-End (NETE) Model For Future C2 Architecture Assessments | url = http://www.dodccrp.org/events/10th_ICCRTS/CD/papers/141.pdf |  accessdate = 2011-02-14}}</ref>,  and manufacturing facility design  <ref>{{cite web | url = http://biopharminternational.findpharma.com/biopharm/article/articleDetail.jsp?id=432392| title = Facility Design: Simulation Methodology for Facility Design| accessdate = 2011-02-14}}</ref>
