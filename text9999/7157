The '''Black-faced Cormorant''' (''Phalacrocorax fuscescens''), also known as the Black-faced Shag, is a medium-sized member of the [[cormorant]] family.  Upperparts, including facial skin and bill, are black, with white underparts.

==Range==
It is found along much of the southern coast of [[Australia]] from eastern [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]] to [[Cape Leeuwin]], [[Western Australia]], as well as around the coast of [[Tasmania]] and the islands of [[Bass Strait]].

==Habitat==
Unlike the other cormorants found around the Australian continent, the habitat of the Black-faced Cormorant is exclusively coastal and marine. 

==Ecology==
The Black-faced-Cormorant feeds largely on small coastal fish, diving in depths up to 12 m.  Fish of lengths up to 50cm have been observed to be taken.  The birds sometimes forage in flocks, apparently in an organised way.
