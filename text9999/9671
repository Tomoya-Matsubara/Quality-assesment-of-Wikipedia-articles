'''''ECW''''' is<!---Do not change to "was" or "former" etc. WP:TV guidelines are to use "is" regardless of whether the show is still airing or not.---> a [[professional wrestling]] [[television program]] for [[World Wrestling Entertainment]] (WWE), based on the independent [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] (ECW) promotion that lasted from 1992 to 2001. The show's name also referred to the ECW [[WWE Brand Extension|brand]], in which WWE employees were assigned to work and perform, complementary to WWE's other brands, [[WWE Raw|Raw]] and [[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown]]. It debuted on June 13, 2006 on [[Syfy|Sci Fi]] in the United States and ran for close to four years until it aired its final episode on February 16, 2010 on the rebranded Syfy.<ref name="FinalECW">{{cite web|url= http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/WWE_News_3/article_38772.shtml|title=WWE Officially Announces NXT's Debut Date Replacing ECW, Only Two Episodes Remaining|last=Caldwell|first =James|date=2010-02-05|publisher=Pro Wrestling Torch|accessdate= 2010-02-05}}</ref>

==Show history==
===Launch on Sci Fi/Syfy===
WWE acquired [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] and its [[WWE Video Library|video library]] in 2003 and later began reintroducing ECW through content from the ECW library and a series books, which included the release of ''[[The Rise and Fall of ECW]]'' documentary.<ref name="wwe58">{{cite book|last1=Shields|first1=Brian|last2=Sullivan|first2=Kevin|title=WWE: History of WrestleMania|year=2009|page=58|accessdate=2009-07-16}}</ref> The enormous popularity of ECW merchandise prompted WWE to organize [[ECW One Night Stand (2005)|ECW One Night Stand]], an ECW reunion pay-per-view in 2005.<ref name="wwe58"/> The financial and critical success of the event motivated WWE to organize a second [[ECW One Night Stand (2006)|One Night Stand]] the following year. With rejuvenated interest in the ECW product, WWE began exploring the possibility of reviving the promotion full time. On May 26, 2006, WWE announced the launch of ECW as a stand-alone [[WWE Brand Extension|brand]], congruous to [[WWE Raw|Raw]] and [[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown!]], with its own show on Sci Fi (now [[Syfy]]).<ref name=SciFi>{{cite web|title=WWE brings ECW to Sci Fi Channel| publisher=WWE|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/ecw/scifi|accessdate=2006-06-02}}</ref> Despite initial concerns that professional wrestling would not be accepted by Sci Fi's demographic, network President [[Bonnie Hammer]] stated that she believed ECW would fit the channel's theme of "stretching the imagination".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20060525/tv_nm/scifi_dc_1| title=Sci Fi grapples with summer wrestling series|accessdate=2006-05-21|quote="It will have a nice little twist that will fit in the brand"}}</ref>{{Dead link|date=February 2010}} Sci Fi (now known as Syfy) is owned by [[NBC Universal]], parent company of [[USA Network]] and exclusive cable broadcaster of Raw. ECW's weekly series was originally given a thirteen episode run as a "summer series" on [[Syfy|Sci Fi]]. The premiere received a 2.79 [[Nielsen ratings|rating]], making it the highest rated show on cable in its time slot.<ref name=rating>{{cite web|title=Sci Fi Channel pins the competition with ECW's triumphant return to television|publisher=The Futon Critic|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news.aspx?id=20060614scifi01|accessdate= 2007-07-08}}</ref> Because of its good ratings it was granted an extended run through the end of 2007.<ref name="extend">{{cite

====Original format (2006)====
The ECW brand was initially produced differently from WWE's other brands. For televised events, the main ring-facing cameras were placed on a different location in the arena while the [[wrestling ring]] itself featured an ECW logo on the mat and blank turnbuckle covers. The male performers were referred to "Extremists" as opposed to "Superstars" while female performers were called "Vixens" as opposed to [[WWE Diva|Divas]]. However, the brand steadily began being produced following the same format of the other brands, and as opposed to the original promotion, match rules, such as [[Professional wrestling#Countout|count outs]] and [[Professional wrestling#Disqualification|disqualifications]], were now standard. Matches featuring the rule set of the original promotion were then classified as being contested under "[[Hardcore wrestling|Extreme Rules]]" and are only fought when specified. The only [[pay-per-view]] event hosted exclusively by the ECW brand since its launch was [[December to Dismember (2006)|December to Dismember]] in December 2006. On March 14, 2007, before another one could be scheduled, WWE announced that all future pay-per-views would feature all three brands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://corporate.wwe.com/news/2007/2007_03_14.jsp|title=WWE Pay-Per-Views to follow WrestleMania format|accessdate=2007-03-21}}</ref>
[[File:ExtremeChampionshipWrestling.png|175px|thumb|right|''ECW'' logo (2006<U+2013>2008)]]

Former ECW owner [[Paul Heyman]] served as the on-air "ECW Representative" (a reference to how Heyman had been identified on ''Monday Night Raw'' back in 1997). According to an interview in the UK newspaper ''[[The Sun (newspaper)|The Sun]]'', Heyman wrote the brand's weekly scripts and submitted them to writers for possible changes, and then [[Vince McMahon]] for final approval. Following December to Dismember, Heyman was relieved from both his on and off-air duties with World Wrestling Entertainment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/ecw/news/heymanout|title=Heyman out|accessdate=2006-12-23}}</ref>

====Change in format (2007-2010) ====
[[File:Ecwset.jpg|200px|thumb|right|The ''ECW'' set used from October 31, 2006-January 15, 2008.]]
While the show started out a ratings success, it began drawing criticism from fans of the original ECW early on. This was most evident by the [[Heat (professional wrestling)#Go-away heat|negative crowd reaction]] "old school" fans gave the main event of [[Dave Batista|Batista]] vs. [[Paul Wight|The Big Show]] at the August 1, 2006 show from [[Hammerstein Ballroom]], which often held original ECW events while it was a company.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oowrestling.com/features/20060801.shtml|title=The New ECW?

On October 16, 2007, a "talent exchange" was started between the SmackDown and ECW brands, allowing their respective talent to appear on either brand.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.wwe.com/shows/ecw/archive/10162007/articles/partnershipforming|title=Partnership Forming?|date=2007-10-16| accessdate=2007-10-25|publisher=WWE}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.wwe.com/shows/ecw/archive/10162007/|title=Setting the night on fire|accessdate=2007-10-25|work=ECW results|publisher= WWE}}</ref> On May 6, 2008, ''ECW'' celebrated its 100th episode on Sci Fi.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/ecw/preview/|accessdate=2008-04-30|title=Preview:Extreme Centennial|publisher=WWE|date=2008-04-29}}</ref> On June 3, 2008 Estrada was replaced by [[Theodore Long]] as General Manager of ECW. On the September 8, 2008 edition of ''Raw'' it was announced a "talent exchange" was started between the Raw and ECW brands, allowing their respective talent to appear on either brand. (Following the [[2009 WWE Draft]], both of these talent exchanges were quietly dropped.) ''ECW'' moved to 9:00PM Eastern/8:00PM Central on September 30, 2008.<ref>[http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news.aspx?id=7692 "Lost", "Sanctuary" Among SCI FI's Fall Premieres], ''The Futon Critic'', July 3, 2008</ref> ''ECW'' moved back to 10:00PM Eastern/9:00PM Central on May 5, 2009.<ref>[http://www.sescoops.com/wwe/ECW_On_Sci_Fi_Changing_Timeslots_Again_Sexiest_WWE_Divas.shtml ECW On Sci Fi Changing Timeslots Again, Sexiest WWE Divas], ''Sports Entertainment Scoops'', April 15, 2009</ref> On the April 7 edition of ''ECW'' it was announced that Theodore Long was returning to SmackDown to fulfill the role of General Manager. From this point the Interim General Manager was named as [[Taryn Terrell|Tiffany]] who took over as full time General Manager on the June 30, 2009 episode.<ref>http://www.wwe.com/shows/ecw/articles/10573924/newfaces</ref>
On July 7, 2009, the Sci Fi Channel renamed itself to "Syfy", prompting WWE to rename the show ''ECW on Syfy'' to reflect the changes.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.seattlepi.com/tvguide/407905_tvgif7.html| title=Sci Fi Morphs Into Syfy|last=Eng|first= Joyce|date=2009-07-07| publisher=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]|accessdate=2009-07-08}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref><ref name="Syfy/scifi change">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/ecw/archive/06302009/|title=Extreme Changes|last=Medalis|first=Kara A.|date=2009-06-30|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]|accessdate=2010-02-04}}</ref> In 2009 a "superstar initiative" was established for the purpose of introducing new talent to WWE programming, mainly those from WWE's developmental territory [[Florida Championship Wrestling]] to ECW's roster.<ref name="Syfy/scifi change" />

====Cancellation and aftermath====
On February 2, 2010, WWE Chairman [[Vince McMahon]] announced that ''ECW'' would be going off the air and would be replaced with a new weekly program in its slot in what McMahon announced as "the next evolution of WWE; the next evolution of television history."  It was later announced that the show would air its final episode on February 16, 2010. On the February 4, 2010 episode of ''[[WWE Superstars]]'', the new show's name was announced as ''[[WWE NXT]]''.<ref name="NXT">{{cite web| url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/TV_Reports_9/article_38751.shtml|first=James|last=Caldwell|title=Caldwell's WWE Superstar TV Report 2/4: Complete coverage of Team Morrison vs. Team McIntyre six-man tag, awesome Bourne vs. Carlito match|date=2010-02-04| accessdate=2010-02-05|publisher=Pro Wrestling Torch}}</ref> With the ECW brand disbanded, the ECW roster became [[free agent]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/archive/02082010/|first=Greg|last=Adkins|title=Raw's pit stomp|date=2010-02-08|accessdate=2010-02-09|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]}}</ref>

===Online presence===
At ECW's launch, WWE.com introduced ''Hardcore Hangover'', a video feature which allowed fans in the United States and Canada to stream or download video footage from the weekly show.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/ecw/hardcorehangover/|title= Hardcore Hangover|accessdate=2007-10-25|publisher=WWE}}</ref> On October 16, 2007 it was replaced by a new feature which made full episodes of the show available for streaming on WWE.com the day after they aired. After gathering a list of names from fans and conducting an online poll, the feature was named ''ECW X-Stream'' on October 31, 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/ecw/ecwreplay/|title=Watch it Again Exclusively on WWE.com|accessdate=2007-10-17|publisher=WWE}}</ref> Past episodes of ECW are now viewable on [[Hulu]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/news/10303890|title=Hulu to stream full episodes of SmackDown, ECW|accessdate=2009-06-12|publisher=WWE}}</ref>

ECW brand shows were held in large arenas as a part of the taping schedules of WWE's other brands. This was in sharp contrast to the original [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] which ran most of its events in smaller venues.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://prowrestlinghistory.com/ecw/index.html|title=The History of Extreme Championship Wrestling|accessdate= 2007-08-12|publisher= Pro Wrestling History}}</ref> The show generally aired live on Tuesdays directly before <U+2014> when touring the west coast <U+2014> or after ''SmackDown'' was taped,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rajah.com/base/node/7253|title=WWE Makes Changes To Compete With WSX|accessdate= 2007-02-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://rajah.com/base/node/7293|title=ECW TV Staying Live|accessdate=2007-02-07}}</ref> though it was also recorded and placed on a [[broadcast delay]] until later in the night depending on what circumstances dictated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rajah.com/base/node/6941|title=WWE Smackdown! & ECW Tapings (12/12/06)|accessdate=2007-02-07}}</ref>

ECW's initial theme song was "[[Bodies (Drowning Pool song)|Bodies]]" by [[Drowning Pool]], which had been used by WWE for Extreme Championship Wrestling before the establishment of the brand. "[[WWE The Music, Vol. 8|Don't Question My Heart]]" by [[Saliva (band)|Saliva]] featuring [[Brent Smith]], a new version of the song originally performed by Kyle Morrison of the band Shattersphere, was later used to [[Music in professional wrestling|open]] ''ECW'' for the rest of the program's run.<ref>[http://www.wwe.com/subscriptions/wwetunes/vol8/exclusives/salivaecw Saliva goes Extreme - WWE.com]</ref> On January 22, 2008, ''ECW'' began broadcasting in [[High-definition television|HD]], along with a new HD set, which is shared among all three WWE brands.<ref>{{cite web|title=WWE Goes HD|url= http://corporate.wwe.com/news/2008/2008_01_14.jsp|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2008-01-15}}</ref>
