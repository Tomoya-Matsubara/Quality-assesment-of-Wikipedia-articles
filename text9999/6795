'''SMS ''Berlin''''' ("His Majesty's Ship ''Berlin''"){{efn|name=SMS|}} was the third member of the seven-vessel {{sclass|Bremen|cruiser|4}}, built by the [[Imperial German Navy]]. Throughout her over 40-year long career, she served with the Imperial Navy, the ''[[Reichsmarine]]'', and the ''[[Kriegsmarine]]''. She was built by the [[Kaiserliche Werft Danzig|Imperial Dockyard]] in [[Danzig]], laid down in 1902, launched in September 1903, and commissioned into the [[High Seas Fleet]] in April 1905. Armed with a main battery of ten {{convert|10.5|cm|abbr=on}} guns and two {{convert|45|cm|abbr=on}} [[torpedo tube]]s, ''Berlin'' was capable of a top speed of {{convert|22|kn|lk=in}}. 

''Berlin'' served in the reconnaissance forces of the High Seas Fleet from her commissioning to 1911, when she was sent abroad for overseas duties. She returned to the scouting forces the following year, where she remained through the first two years of [[World War I]]. She spent 1916 as a minelayer, and was disarmed in 1917. She was one of six cruisers permitted to Germany by the [[Treaty of Versailles]], and she remained in service with the new ''Reichsmarine'' through the 1920s as a [[training ship]]. She was withdrawn from active duty in 1929, and later used as a [[barracks ship]] by the ''Kriegsmarine'', a role she filled through [[World War II]]. After the end of the war, she was loaded with [[chemical weapon]]s and scuttled in the [[Skagerrak]].

==Construction==
{{main|Bremen class cruiser}}

''Berlin'' was ordered under the contract name ''[[Ersatz]]'' {{SMS|Zieten||2}}{{efn|name=provisional names}} and was laid down at the [[Kaiserliche Werft Danzig|Imperial Dockyard]] in [[Danzig]] in 1902 and launched on 22 September 1903, after which [[fitting-out]] work commenced. She was commissioned into the [[High Seas Fleet]] on 4 April 1905.<ref>Gr<U+00F6>ner, pp. 102<U+2013>104</ref> The ship was {{convert|111.1|m|sp=us}} [[length overall|long overall]] and had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|13.3|m|abbr=on}} and a [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|5.51|m|abbr=on}} forward. She displaced {{convert|3792|t|abbr=on}} at full combat load.<ref name=G102>Gr<U+00F6>ner, p. 102</ref> Her propulsion system consisted of two [[triple-expansion engine]]s, designed to give {{convert|10000|ihp|lk=in}} for a top speed of {{convert|22|kn|lk=in}}. The engines were powered by ten coal-fired Marine-type [[water-tube boiler]]s. ''Berlin'' carried up to {{convert|860|t|LT}} of coal, which gave her a range of {{convert|4270|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|12|kn}}. She had a crew of 14 officers and 274&ndash;287 enlisted men.<ref>Gr<U+00F6>ner, pp. 102<U+2013>103</ref>

The ship was armed with ten [[10.5 cm SK L/40 naval gun|10.5&nbsp;cm SK L/40 guns]] in single mounts. Two were placed side by side forward on the [[forecastle]], six were located amidships, three on either side, and two were placed side by side aft. The guns could engage targets out to {{convert|12200|m|abbr=on}}. They were supplied with 1,500 rounds of ammunition, for 150 shells per gun. She was also equipped with two {{convert|45|cm|abbr=on|1}} [[torpedo tube]]s with five [[torpedo]]es. They were submerged in the hull on the [[broadside]]. In 1915, ''Berlin'' was modified to carry 80 [[naval mine]]s.<ref name=G103>Gr<U+00F6>ner, p. 103</ref> The ship was protected by an armored deck that was up to {{convert|80|mm|abbr=on}} thick. The [[conning tower]] had {{convert|100|mm|abbr=on}} thick sides, and the guns were protected by {{convert|50|mm|abbr=on}} thick shields.<ref name=G102/>

==Service history==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-07600, Kreuzer "Berlin".jpg|thumb|''Berlin'' after her modernization in 1921&ndash;1923]]

After her commissioning, ''Berlin'' was assigned to the reconnaissance forces of the High Seas Fleet. In 1911, she was deployed abroad for service on foreign stations. She returned to Germany the following year, and rejoined the fleet cruiser squadron.<ref name=G104>Gr<U+00F6>ner, p. 104</ref> In October 1913, the ship left Germany again bound for [[Veracruz]], to relieve {{SMS|Hertha||2}} in the Caribbean.<ref>{{cite news |title=German Cruiser For Mazatlan |author= |url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9F05EFDB133FE633A2575BC2A9669D946296D6CF |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=28 October 1913 |accessdate=18 December 2012}}</ref> In 1915, the ship was retrofitted to carry 80 mines.<ref name=G103/> She was in drydock in May 1916, and so she was unavailable for the [[Battle of Jutland]] on the last day of the month.<ref>Campbell, p. 23</ref> In October 1916, the British [[submarine]] {{HMS|E38}} attacked ''Berlin'', but its torpedoes missed.<Ref>Tucker, p. 667</ref> After the end of the year, ''Berlin'' was disarmed.<ref name=G103/> She was thereafter used as a coastal defense ship, a role she performed through to the end of the war in 1918.<ref name=G104/>

''Berlin'' was among the six light cruisers Germany was permitted to retain by the [[Treaty of Versailles]].{{efn|name=Versailles}} In the service of the newly reorganized ''[[Reichsmarine]]'', ''Berlin'' served as a training cruiser, starting in 1922.<ref name=G104/> That year, [[Wilhelm Canaris]] was assigned to the ship, which went to Norway in November 1923. In January 1924, ''Berlin'' departed German waters for an extended overseas cruise, which was the first time a German warship had done so since the end of World War I. While on the cruise, Canaris met a naval cadet by the name of [[Reinhard Heydrich]], who went on to become a close friend and eventual architect of [[The Holocaust]].<ref>Waller, p. 12</ref><ref>Mueller, pp. 60&ndash;61</ref> In 1928, ''Berlin'' conducted a training cruise around the world, which included a stop in [[Fremantle]].<ref>{{cite news |title=German Cruiser to Visit Fremantle |author= |url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/16484652 |newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=7 August 1928 |accessdate=27 October 2012}}</ref> Training duties lasted until 1929, when she was withdrawn from service. Starting in 1935, the ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' used ''Berlin'' as a [[barracks ship]] in [[Kiel]]. There, she survived [[World War II]]; in the aftermath of the war, she was loaded with chemical weapons and scuttled in the [[Skaggerak]] to dispose of them, on 31 May 1947.<ref name=G104/>
