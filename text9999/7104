At 14.0 million&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (5.4 million&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi), it is the fifth-largest continent in area after [[Asia]], [[Africa]], [[North America]], and [[South America]]. For comparison, Antarctica is nearly twice the size of Australia. About 98% of Antarctica is covered by [[ice]] that averages at least {{convert|1.6|km|mi}} in thickness.

Only cold-adapted organisms survive there, including many types of [[algae]], [[animal]]s (for example [[mite]]s, [[nematode]]s, [[penguin]]s, [[Pinniped|seals]] and [[tardigrade]]s), [[bacteria]], [[fungus|fungi]], [[plant]]s, and [[protist]]a. Vegetation where it occurs is [[tundra]].

Although myths and speculation about a ''[[Terra Australis]]'' ("Southern Land") date back to antiquity, the first confirmed sighting of the continent is commonly accepted to have occurred in 1820 by the [[List of Russian explorers|Russian expedition]] of [[Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen]] and [[Mikhail Lazarev]]. The continent, however, remained largely neglected for the rest of the 19th century because of its hostile environment, lack of resources, and isolation.
The [[Antarctic Treaty System|Antarctic Treaty]] was signed in 1959 by 12 countries; to date, 47 countries have signed the treaty. The treaty prohibits military activities and mineral mining, prohibits nuclear explosions and nuclear power, supports scientific research, and protects the continent's [[ecozone]]. Ongoing experiments are conducted by more than 4,000 scientists of multiple nationalities.

==Etymology==
The first formal use of the name "Antarctica" as a continental name in the 1890s is attributed to the Scottish [[Cartography|cartographer]] [[John George Bartholomew]]. The name ''Antarctica'' is the [[Romanization of Greek|romanized]] version of the [[Greek language|Greek]] compound word ''<U+1F00><U+03BD><U+03C4><U+03B1><U+03C1><U+03BA><U+03C4><U+03B9><U+03BA><U+03AE>'' (''antarktik<U+00E9>''), feminine of ''<U+1F00><U+03BD><U+03C4><U+03B1><U+03C1><U+03BA><U+03C4><U+03B9><U+03BA><U+03CC><U+03C2>'' (''antarktikos''),<ref>{{Citation|author=Liddell, Henry George|coauthors=Scott, Robert|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%239514|contribution=Antarktikos|title=A Greek<U+2013>English Lexicon|editor=Crane, Gregory R.|series=Perseus Digital Library|publisher=Tufts University|accessdate=16 November 2011}}.</ref> meaning "opposite to the [[Arctic]]", "opposite to the north".<ref>{{Cite book|author=Hince, Bernadette|url=http://books.google.com/?id=lJd8_owUxFEC&pg=PA6&lpg=PA6&dq=antarctica+opposite+of+north+greek|title=The Antarctic Dictionary|publisher=CSIRO Publishing|page=6|isbn=9780957747111|year=2000}}</ref>

[[File:Antarctic-Iceberg.jpg|thumb|An [[iceberg]] dwarfs a ship in this 1920s English magazine illustration of a [[whaler]] in the Antarctic.]]

Belief in the existence of a ''Terra Australis'' <U+2013> a vast continent in the far south of the globe to "balance" the northern lands of Europe, Asia and [[North Africa]] <U+2013> has existed since the times of [[Ptolemy]] (1st century AD), who suggested the idea to preserve the [[symmetry]] of all known [[landmass]]es in the world. Even in the late 17th century, after explorers had found that South America and Australia were not part of the fabled "Antarctica", geographers believed that the continent was much larger than its actual size.

European maps continued to show this hypothetical land until Captain [[James Cook]]'s ships, [[HMS Resolution (Cook)|HMS ''Resolution'']] and ''[[HMS Adventure (1771)|Adventure]]'', crossed the Antarctic Circle on 17 January 1773, in December 1773 and again in January 1774.<ref>{{Cite web|publisher=The Mariners' Museum|title=Age of Exploration: John Cook|url=http://www.mariner.org/educationalad/ageofex/cook.php|accessdate=12 February 2006|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060207175624/http://www.mariner.org/educationalad/ageofex/cook.php<!-- Bot retrieved archive -->|archivedate=7 February 2006}}</ref> Cook came within about {{convert|75|mi|km}} of the Antarctic coast before retreating in the face of field ice in January 1773.<ref>James Cook, ''The Journals'', edited by Philip Edwards.

Von Bellingshausen saw Antarctica on 27 January 1820, three days before Bransfield sighted land, and ten months before Palmer did so in November 1820. On that day the two-ship expedition led by Von Bellingshausen and [[Mikhail Lazarev]] reached a point within {{convert|32|km|mi|abbr=on}} of the Antarctic mainland and saw ice fields there. The first documented landing on mainland Antarctica was by the American sealer [[John Davis (sealer)|John Davis]] in [[West Antarctica]] on 7 February 1821, although some historians dispute this claim{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}.

In December 1839, as part of the [[United States Exploring Expedition]] of 1838<U+2013>42 conducted by the [[United States Navy]] (sometimes called the "Ex. Ex.", or "the Wilkes Expedition"), an expedition sailed from Sydney, Australia, into the [[Antarctic Ocean]], as it was then known, and reported the discovery "of an Antarctic continent west of the [[Balleny Islands]]". That part of Antarctica was later named "[[Wilkes Land]]", a name it maintains to this day.

He sailed along a huge wall of ice that was later named the [[Ross Ice Shelf]].

During the [[Nimrod Expedition]] led by [[Ernest Shackleton]] in 1907, parties led by [[Edgeworth David]] became the first to climb Mount Erebus and to reach the [[South Magnetic Pole]]. [[Douglas Mawson]], who assumed the leadership of the Magnetic Pole party on their perilous return, went on to lead several expeditions until retiring in 1931.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.antarctica.gov.au/about-antarctica/history/people-of-antarctic-history/tannatt-edgeworth-david|title=Tannatt William Edgeworth David|publisher=Australian Antarctic Division|accessdate=27 September 2010}}</ref> In addition, Shackleton himself and three other members of his expedition made several firsts in December 1908 <U+2013> February 1909: they were the first humans to traverse the [[Ross Ice Shelf]], the first to traverse the Transantarctic Mountain Range (via the [[Beardmore Glacier]]), and the first to set foot on the South Polar Plateau. An [[Amundsen's South Pole expedition|expedition led by Norwegian polar explorer Roald Amundsen]] from the ship ''[[Fram]]'' became the first to reach the geographic South Pole on 14 December 1911, using a route from the [[Bay of Whales]] and up the [[Axel Heiberg Glacier]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.south-pole.com/p0000101.htm|title=Roald Amundsen|publisher=South-Pole.com|accessdate=9 February 2006}}</ref> One month later, the doomed [[Terra Nova Expedition|Scott Expedition]] reached the pole.

Centered asymmetrically around the [[South Pole]] and largely south of the Antarctic Circle, Antarctica is the southernmost continent and is surrounded by the [[Southern Ocean]]; alternatively, it may be considered to be surrounded by the southern [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]], [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]], and Indian Oceans, or by the southern waters of the [[World Ocean]]. It covers more than {{convert|14000000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on|word=on}},<ref name="CIAfactbook-People"/> making it the fifth-largest continent, about 1.3 times as large as Europe. The coastline measures {{convert|17968|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}<ref name="CIAfactbook-People"/> and is mostly characterized by ice formations, as the following table shows:

Antarctica is divided in two by the [[Transantarctic Mountains]] close to the neck between the Ross Sea and the [[Weddell Sea]]. The portion west of the Weddell Sea and east of the Ross Sea is called West Antarctica and the remainder East Antarctica, because they roughly correspond to the Western and Eastern Hemispheres relative to the [[Greenwich meridian]].

[[File:Antarctica surface.jpg|thumb|left|Elevation colored by relief height]]

About 98% of Antarctica is covered by the [[Antarctic ice sheet]], a [[ice sheet|sheet of ice]] averaging at least {{convert|1.6|km|mi|1|abbr=on}} thick. The continent has about 90% of the world's ice (and thereby about 70% of the world's [[fresh water]]). If all of this ice were melted, sea levels would rise about {{convert|60|m|ft|abbr=on}}.<ref name="howstuffworks">{{cite web | url = http://science.howstuffworks.com/question473.htm | title = How Stuff Works: polar ice caps | publisher = howstuffworks.com | accessdate = 12 February 2006 }}</ref> In most of the interior of the continent, [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] is very low, down to {{convert|20|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} per year; in a few "[[Blue ice (glacial)|blue ice]]" areas precipitation is lower than mass loss by [[Sublimation (chemistry)|sublimation]] and so the local mass balance is negative. In the [[McMurdo Dry Valleys|dry valleys]] the same effect occurs over a rock base, leading to a desiccated landscape.

[[West Antarctica]] is covered by the [[West Antarctic Ice Sheet]]. The sheet has been of recent concern because of the real, if small, possibility of its collapse. If the sheet were to break down, [[Sea level change|ocean levels]] would rise by several metres in a relatively [[geological timescale|geologically short]] period of time, perhaps a matter of centuries. Several Antarctic [[ice stream]]s, which account for about 10% of the ice sheet, [[Ice sheet dynamics|flow]] to one of the many [[Ice shelf#Antarctic ice shelves|Antarctic ice shelves]].

East Antarctica lies on the Indian Ocean side of the [[Transantarctic Mountains]] and comprises [[Coats Land]], [[Queen Maud Land]], [[Enderby Land]], [[Mac. Robertson Land]], [[Wilkes Land]] and [[Victoria Land]]. All but a small portion of this region lies within the [[Eastern Hemisphere]]. East Antarctica is largely covered by the [[East Antarctic Ice Sheet]].

[[File:Mt erebus.jpg|thumb|[[Mount Erebus]], an active volcano on [[Ross Island]]]]

[[Vinson Massif]], the highest peak in Antarctica at {{convert|4892|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, is located in the [[Ellsworth Mountains]]. Antarctica contains [[List of mountains in Antarctica|many other mountains]], both on the main continent and the surrounding islands. Located on [[Ross Island]], Mount Erebus is the world's southernmost active volcano. Another well-known volcano is found on [[Deception Island]], which is famous for a giant eruption in 1970. Minor eruptions are frequent and lava flow has been observed in recent years. Other dormant volcanoes may potentially be active.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.antarctica.ac.uk//about_antarctica/geography/rock/volcanoes.php|title=Volcanoes|author=British Antarctic Survey|publisher=Natural Environment Research Council|accessdate=13 February 2006}}</ref> In 2004, an underwater volcano was found in the [[Antarctic Peninsula]] by American and Canadian researchers.

Antarctica is home to more than 70 lakes that lie at the base of the continental ice sheet. [[Lake Vostok]], discovered beneath Russia's [[Vostok Station]] in 1996, is the largest of these [[subglacial lake]]s. It was once believed that the lake had been sealed off for 500,000 to one million years but a recent survey suggests that, every so often, there are large flows of water from one lake to another.<ref name="Briggs2006">{{cite news | last = Briggs | first = Helen | date = 19 April 2006 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4908292.stm | title = Secret rivers found in Antarctic | publisher = BBC News | accessdate = 7 February 2009 }}</ref>

There is some evidence, in the form of [[ice core]]s drilled to about {{convert|400|m|ft|-2|abbr=on}} above the water line, that Lake Vostok's waters may contain [[microorganism|microbial life]].

==Geology==
{{Main|Geology of Antarctica}}

===Geological history and paleontology===
More than 170&nbsp;million years ago, Antarctica was part of the [[supercontinent]] [[Gondwana]]. Over time, Gondwana gradually broke apart and Antarctica as we know it today was formed around 25&nbsp;million years ago.

====Paleozoic era (540<U+2013>250 Ma)====
During the [[Cambrian|Cambrian period]], Gondwana had a mild climate. West Antarctica was partially in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], and during this period large amounts of [[sandstone]]s, [[limestone]]s and [[shale]]s were deposited. East Antarctica was at the equator, where sea floor [[invertebrate]]s and [[trilobite]]s flourished in the tropical seas. By the start of the [[Devonian|Devonian period]] (416&nbsp;[[annum|Ma]]), Gondwana was in more southern latitudes and the climate was cooler, though fossils of land plants are known from this time. [[Sand]] and [[silt]]s were laid down in what is now the [[Ellsworth Mountains|Ellsworth]], [[Horlick Mountains|Horlick]] and [[Pensacola Mountains]]. [[Glaciation]] began at the end of the Devonian period (360&nbsp;Ma), as Gondwana became centered around the South Pole and the climate cooled, though [[Antarctic flora|flora]] remained. During the [[Permian]] period, the plant life became dominated by [[fern]]-like plants such as ''[[Glossopteris]]'', which grew in swamps. Over time these swamps became deposits of coal in the [[Transantarctic Mountains]]. Towards the end of the Permian period, continued warming led to a dry, hot climate over much of Gondwana.<ref name="Stonehouse">{{cite book | editor-last = Stonehouse | editor-first = B. | title = Encyclopedia of Antarctica and the Southern Oceans | year = 2002 | month = June | publisher = John Wiley & Sons | isbn = 0-471-98665-8 }}</ref>

====Mesozoic era (250<U+2013>65 Ma)====
[[File:Bransfield-Strait.jpg|thumb|left|[[Bransfield Strait]] from [[Catalunyan Saddle]] on [[Livingston Island]], with the [[Antarctic Peninsula]] in the background.]]
As a result of continued warming, the polar ice caps melted and much of Gondwana became a desert. In Eastern Antarctica, the [[seed fern]] became established, and large amounts of sandstone and shale were laid down at this time. [[Synapsid]]s, commonly known as "mammal-like reptiles", were common in Antarctica during the [[Late Permian]] and [[Early Triassic]] and included forms such as ''[[Lystrosaurus]]''. The Antarctic Peninsula began to form during the [[Jurassic]] period (206<U+2013>146&nbsp;Ma), and islands gradually rose out of the ocean. [[Ginkgo]] trees and [[cycad]]s were plentiful during this period. In West Antarctica, [[conifer]]ous [[forest]]s dominated through the entire [[Cretaceous]] period (146<U+2013>65&nbsp;Ma), though [[Nothofagus|Southern beech]] began to take over at the end of this period. [[Ammonite]]s were common in the seas around Antarctica, and dinosaurs were also present, though only three Antarctic dinosaur [[genera]] (''[[Cryolophosaurus]]'' and ''[[Glacialisaurus]]'', from the [[Mount Kirkpatrick Formation|Hanson Formation]],<ref name="SmithPol2007">{{cite journal | last = Smith | first = Nathan D. | last2 = Pol | first2 = Diego | year = 2007 | title = Anatomy of a basal sauropodomorph dinosaur from the Early Jurassic Hanson Formation of Antarctica | journal = Acta Palaeontologica Polonica | volume = 52 | issue = 4 | pages = 657<U+2013>674 | url = http://www.app.pan.pl/acta52/app52-657.pdf | format = PDF }}{{dead link | date = July 2011 }}</ref> and ''[[Antarctopelta]]'') have been described to date.<ref>{{cite web | author=Leslie, Mitch | title = The Strange Lives of Polar Dinosaurs | url = http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/polar-dinosaurs-200712.html| publisher=[[Smithsonian Magazine]]| month=December | year=2007 | accessdate = 24 January 2008 }}</ref> It was during this period that Gondwana began to break up.

====Gondwanaland breakup (160<U+2013>23 Ma)====
The cooling of Antarctica occurred stepwise, as the continental spread changed the oceanic currents from longitudinal equator-to-pole temperature-equalizing currents to latitudinal currents that preserved and accentuated latitude temperature differences.

Africa separated from Antarctica around 160&nbsp;Ma, followed by the [[Indian subcontinent]], in the early Cretaceous (about 125&nbsp;Ma). About 65&nbsp;Ma, Antarctica (then connected to Australia) still had a tropical to subtropical climate, complete with a [[marsupial]] [[fauna]]. About 40&nbsp;Ma Australia-[[New Guinea]] separated from Antarctica, so that latitudinal currents could isolate Antarctica from Australia, and the first ice began to appear. During the [[Eocene-Oligocene extinction event]] about 34&nbsp;million years ago, CO<sub>2</sub> levels have been found to be about 760 ppm<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.physorg.com/news172072921.html | title = New CO2 data helps unlock the secrets of Antarctic formation | publisher = Physorg.com | date = | accessdate =26 July 2011}}</ref> and had been decreasing from earlier levels in the thousands of ppm. Around 23&nbsp;Ma, the [[Drake Passage]] opened between Antarctica and South America, resulting in the [[Antarctic Circumpolar Current]] that completely isolated the continent. Models of the changes suggest that declining CO<sub>2</sub> levels became more important.<ref name="DeContoPollard2003">{{cite journal | last1 = DeConto | first1 = Robert M. | last2 = Pollard | first2 = David | title = Rapid Cenozoic glaciation of Antarctica induced by declining atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> | journal = Nature | volume = 421 | pages = 245<U+2013>9 | date = 16 January 2003 | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v421/n6920/abs/nature01290.html | doi = 10.1038/nature01290 |accessdate = 19 October 2009 | issue = 6920 | pmid = 12529638 }}</ref> The ice began to spread, replacing the forests that then covered the continent.

===Geology of present-day Antarctica===
[[File:AntarcticBedrock.jpg|thumb|left| Subglacial [[topography]] and [[bathymetry]] of bedrock underlying Antarctica ice sheet]]

The geological study of Antarctica has been greatly hindered by the fact that nearly all of the continent is permanently covered with a thick layer of ice. However, new techniques such as [[remote sensing]], [[ground-penetrating radar]] and [[satellite imagery]] have begun to reveal the structures beneath the ice.

Geologically, West Antarctica closely resembles the [[Andes]] mountain range of South America.<ref name="Stonehouse" /> The [[Antarctic Peninsula]] was formed by uplift and [[metamorphism]] of sea bed sediments during the late [[Paleozoic]] and the early [[Mesozoic]] eras. This sediment uplift was accompanied by [[igneous]] intrusions and [[volcanism]]. The most common rocks in West Antarctica are [[andesite]] and [[rhyolite]] volcanics formed during the Jurassic period. There is also evidence of volcanic activity, even after the ice sheet had formed, in [[Marie Byrd Land]] and [[Alexander Island]]. The only anomalous area of West Antarctica is the [[Ellsworth Mountains]] region, where the [[stratigraphy]] is more similar to the eastern part of the continent.

East Antarctica is geologically varied, dating from the [[Precambrian]] era, with some rocks formed more than 3&nbsp;billion years ago. It is composed of a [[Metamorphic rock|metamorphic]] and [[igneous]] platform which is the basis of the [[Shield (geology)|continental shield]]. On top of this base are various modern rocks, such as [[sandstone]]s, [[limestone]]s, coal and [[shale]]s laid down during the Devonian and Jurassic periods to form the [[Transantarctic Mountains]]. In coastal areas such as [[Shackleton Range]] and [[Victoria Land]] some [[Geologic fault|faulting]] has occurred.

The main mineral resource known on the continent is coal.<ref name="Trewby2002" /> It was first recorded near the [[Beardmore Glacier]] by [[Frank Wild]] on the [[Nimrod Expedition]], and now low-grade coal is known across many parts of the Transantarctic Mountains. The [[Prince Charles Mountains]] contain significant deposits of iron ore. The most valuable resources of Antarctica lie offshore, namely the [[oil field|oil]] and [[natural gas field]]s found in the Ross Sea in 1973. Exploitation of all mineral resources is [[Ban (law)|banned]] until 2048 by the [[Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty]].

Antarctica is the coldest place on [[Earth]]. The coldest natural temperature ever recorded on Earth was {{convert|<U+2212>89.2|C|F|1|abbr=on}} at the [[Russia]]n [[Vostok Station]] in Antarctica on 21 July 1983.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ecoworldly.com/2008/12/14/the-coldest-inhabited-places-on-earth/|title=The Coldest Inhabited Places on Earth|work=Eco Worldly|date=14 December 2008|author=Hudson, Gavin|accessdate=8 February 2009}}{{dead link|date=July 2011}}</ref> For comparison, this is 11&nbsp;<U+00B0>C (20&nbsp;<U+00B0>F) colder than [[sublimation (chemistry)|subliming]] [[dry ice]]. Antarctica is a frozen desert with little [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]]; the South Pole itself receives less than {{convert|10|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} per year, on average. Temperatures reach a minimum of between {{convert|<U+2212>80|C|F|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|<U+2212>90|C|F|0|abbr=on}} in the interior in winter and reach a maximum of between {{convert|5|C|F|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|15|C|F|0|abbr=on}} near the coast in summer. Sunburn is often a health issue as the snow surface reflects almost all of the ultraviolet light falling on it.<ref name="BAS-weather">{{Cite web|url=http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/met/jds/weather/weather.htm|title=Weather in the Antarctic|author=British Antarctic Survey|publisher=Natural Environment Research Council|accessdate=9 February 2006}}</ref>

East Antarctica is colder than its western counterpart because of its higher elevation. [[Weather front]]s rarely penetrate far into the continent, leaving the center cold and dry. Despite the lack of precipitation over the central portion of the continent, ice there lasts for extended time periods. Heavy snowfalls are not uncommon on the coastal portion of the continent, where snowfalls of up to {{convert|1.22|m|in|0}} in 48 hours have been recorded.

At the edge of the continent, strong [[katabatic wind]]s off the [[polar plateau]] often blow at storm force. In the interior, however, wind speeds are typically moderate. During summer, more [[solar radiation]] reaches the surface during clear days at the South Pole than at the [[equator]] because of the 24 hours of sunlight each day at the Pole.<ref name="CIAfactbook-People" />

[[File:AntarcticaDomeCSnow.jpg|thumb|left|The snow surface at [[Dome C]] [[Concordia Station|Station]] is typical of most of the continent's surface.]]
Antarctica is colder than the [[Arctic]] for two reasons. First, much of the continent is more than {{convert|3|km|mi|0}} above sea level, and temperature decreases with elevation. Second, the Arctic Ocean covers the north polar zone: the ocean's relative warmth is transferred through the icepack and prevents temperatures in the Arctic regions from reaching the extremes typical of the land surface of Antarctica.  Given the latitude, long periods of constant darkness or constant sunlight create climates unfamiliar to human beings in much of the rest of the world.<ref name="BAS-weather" />

The [[aurora australis]], commonly known as the southern lights, is a glow observed in the night sky near the South Pole created by the plasma-full [[solar wind]]s that pass by the Earth. Another unique spectacle is [[diamond dust]], a ground-level cloud composed of tiny ice crystals. It generally forms under otherwise clear or nearly clear skies, so people sometimes also refer to it as clear-sky precipitation. A [[sun dog]], a frequent atmospheric [[optical phenomenon]], is a bright "spot" beside the true [[sun]].<ref name="BAS-weather" />

Antarctica has no permanent residents, but a number of governments maintain permanent manned [[research station]]s throughout the continent. The number of people conducting and supporting scientific research and other work on the continent and its nearby islands varies from about 1,000 in winter to about 5,000 in the summer. Many of the stations are staffed year-round, the winter-over personnel typically arriving from their home countries for a one-year assignment.

The first semi-permanent inhabitants of regions near Antarctica (areas situated south of the [[Antarctic Convergence]]) were British and American sealers who used to spend a year or more on [[South Georgia Island|South Georgia]], from 1786 onward. During the [[whaling]] era, which lasted until 1966, the population of that island varied from over 1,000 in the summer (over 2,000 in some years) to some 200 in the winter. Most of the whalers were Norwegian, with an increasing proportion of Britons. The settlements included [[Grytviken]], [[Leith Harbour]], [[King Edward Point]], [[Stromness (South Georgia)|Stromness]], [[Husvik]], [[Prince Olav Harbour]], [[Ocean Harbour]] and [[Godthul]]. Managers and other senior officers of the whaling stations often lived together with their families. Among them was the founder of Grytviken, Captain [[Carl Anton Larsen]], a prominent Norwegian whaler and explorer who, along with his family, adopted British citizenship in 1910.

The first child born in the [[Antarctic Convergence|southern polar region]] was Norwegian girl [[Solveig Gunbj<U+00F8>rg Jacobsen]], born in Grytviken on 8 October 1913, and her birth was registered by the resident British Magistrate of [[South Georgia]]. She was a daughter of Fridthjof Jacobsen, the assistant manager of the whaling station, and of Klara Olette Jacobsen. Jacobsen arrived on the island in 1904 to become the manager of Grytviken, serving from 1914 to 1921; two of his children were born on the island.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Headland, Robert K.|title=The Island of South Georgia|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1984|isbn=9780521252744|oclc=473919719}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=October 2011}}<!--there are other editions...-->

A variety of marine animals exist and rely, directly or indirectly, on the phytoplankton. Antarctic sea life includes [[penguin]]s, [[blue whales]], [[orca]]s, [[colossal squid]]s and [[fur seal]]s. The [[Emperor penguin]] is the only penguin that breeds during the winter in Antarctica, while the [[Adelie Penguin|Ad<U+00E9>lie Penguin]] breeds farther south than any other penguin. The [[Rockhopper penguin]] has distinctive feathers around the eyes, giving the appearance of elaborate eyelashes. [[King penguin]]s, [[Chinstrap penguin]]s, and [[Gentoo Penguin]]s also breed in the Antarctic.

The [[Antarctic fur seal]] was very heavily hunted in the 18th and 19th centuries for its pelt by sealers from the United States and the United Kingdom. The [[Weddell Seal]], a "[[true seal]]", is named after [[James Weddell|Sir James Weddell]], commander of British sealing expeditions in the [[Weddell Sea]]. [[Antarctic krill]], which congregates in large [[Shoaling and schooling|schools]], is the [[keystone species]] of the [[ecosystem]] of the [[Southern Ocean]], and is an important food organism for whales, seals, [[leopard seal]]s, fur seals, [[squid]], [[Notothenioidei|icefish]], penguins, [[albatross]]es and many other birds.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.knet.co.za/antarctica/fauna_and_flora.htm|title=Creatures of Antarctica|accessdate=6 February 2006|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20050214015049/http://www.knet.co.za/antarctica/fauna_and_flora.htm|archivedate=14 February 2005}}</ref>

A census of sea life carried out during the [[International Polar Year]] and which involved some 500 researchers was released in 2010.

[[File:Lichen squamulose.jpg|thumb|About 400 species of [[lichen]]-forming fungi are known to exist in Antarctica.]]
The climate of Antarctica does not allow extensive vegetation. A combination of freezing temperatures, poor [[soil]] quality, lack of moisture, and lack of sunlight inhibit plant growth. As a result, the diversity of plant life is very small and limited in distribution. Excluding organisms which are not plants ([[algae]] and [[fungi]], including [[lichen]]-forming species), the [[flora]] of the continent largely consists of [[bryophyte]]s (there are about 100 species of [[moss]]es and 25 species of [[Marchantiophyta|liverwort]]s), with only two species of flowering plants, both found in the Antarctic Peninsula: ''[[Deschampsia antarctica]]'' (Antarctic hair grass) and ''[[Colobanthus quitensis]]'' (Antarctic pearlwort).

The Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty (also known as the Environmental Protocol or Madrid Protocol) came into force in 1998, and is the main instrument concerned with conservation and management of biodiversity in Antarctica. The Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting is advised on environmental and conservation issues in Antarctica by the Committee for Environmental Protection. A major concern within this committee is the risk to Antarctica from unintentional introduction of non-native species from outside the region.<ref name="BridgeHughes73">{{cite journal | last1 = Bridge | first1 = Paul D. | first2 = Kevin.

The passing of the [[Antarctic Conservation Act]] (1978) in the U.S. brought several restrictions to U.S. activity on Antarctica. The introduction of alien plants or animals can bring a criminal penalty, as can the extraction of any indigenous species. The [[overfishing]] of krill, which plays a large role in the Antarctic ecosystem, led officials to enact regulations on fishing. The Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), a treaty that came into force in 1980, requires that regulations managing all Southern Ocean fisheries consider potential effects on the entire Antarctic ecosystem.<ref name="CIAfactbook-People" /> Despite these new acts, unregulated and illegal fishing, particularly of [[Patagonian toothfish]] (marketed as Chilean Sea Bass in the U.S.), remains a serious problem. The illegal fishing of toothfish has been increasing, with estimates of 32,000&nbsp;[[Metric ton|tonnes]] (35,300&nbsp;short tons) in 2000.<ref name="KirbyBBC-2001">{{cite news | last = Kirby | first = Alex | date = 15 August 2001 | title = Toothfish at risk from illegal catches | publisher = BBC News | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/1492380.stm | accessdate = 22 October 2011 }}</ref><ref name="AUgovAntartica-toothfish">{{cite web | title = Toothfish | publisher = Australian Antarctic Division | url = http://www.antarctica.gov.au/about-antarctica/fact-files/animals/fish/toothfish | accessdate = 22 October 2011 }}</ref>

New claims on Antarctica have been suspended since 1959 and the continent is considered politically neutral. Its status is regulated by the 1959 [[Antarctic Treaty]] and other related agreements, collectively called the [[Antarctic Treaty System]]. Antarctica is defined as all land and [[ice shelf|ice shelves]] south of 60<U+00B0> S for the purposes of the Treaty System. The treaty was signed by twelve countries including the [[Soviet Union]] (and later Russia), the United Kingdom, [[Argentina]], [[Chile]], Australia, and the United States.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.ats.aq/devAS/ats_parties.aspx?lang=e | title = Antarctic Treaty System <U+2013> Parties | publisher = Antarctic Treaty and the Secretariat | accessdate = 20 October 2009 }}</ref> It set aside Antarctica as a scientific preserve, established freedom of scientific investigation and environmental protection, and banned military activity on the continent. This was the first [[arms control]] agreement established during the [[Cold War]].

The Argentine, British, and Chilean claims all overlap, and have caused friction. The areas shown as [[Australian Antarctic Territory|Australia's]] and [[Ross Dependency|New Zealand's]] claims were British territory until they were handed over following the countries' independence. Australia currently claims the largest area. The claims of Britain, Australia, New Zealand, France and Norway are all recognised by each other.

Other countries participating as members of Antarctic Treaty have a territorial interest in the Antarctic continent but the provisions of the Treaty do not allow them to make their claims while it is in force.<ref name="peecug1">{{cite web | url = http://library.jid.org/en/mono38/nieto.htm | title = La Antartica | publisher = Library.jid.org | date = | accessdate = 4 November 2008 }}</ref><ref name="peecug2">[http://www.afese.com/img/revistas/revista40/laantartida.pdf Afese.com].

==Economy==

{{Main|Economy of Antarctica}}
[[File:Antarctic cod.jpg|thumb|The illegal capture and sale of the [[Patagonian toothfish]] has led to several arrests. Pictured here is the [[Antarctic toothfish]], a sister species.]]

Although coal, [[hydrocarbon]]s, iron ore, [[platinum]], [[copper]], [[chromium]], nickel, gold and other minerals have been found, they have not been in large enough quantities to exploit. The 1991 [[Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty]] also restricts a struggle for resources. In 1998, a compromise agreement was reached to place an indefinite ban on mining, to be reviewed in 2048, further limiting economic development and exploitation. The primary economic activity is the capture and offshore trading of fish. Antarctic fisheries in 2000<U+2013>01 reported landing 112,934&nbsp;tonnes.

Small-scale "expedition tourism" has existed since 1957 and is currently subject to Antarctic Treaty and Environmental Protocol provisions, but in effect self-regulated by the [[International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators]] (IAATO). Not all vessels associated with Antarctic tourism are members of IAATO, but IAATO members account for 95% of the tourist activity. Travel is largely by small or medium ship, focusing on specific scenic locations with accessible concentrations of iconic wildlife. A total of 37,506 tourists visited during the 2006<U+2013>07 [[Southern Hemisphere|Austral summer]] with nearly all of them coming from commercial ships. The number is predicted to increase to over 80,000 by 2010.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://30atcm.ats.aq/30atcm/Documents/Docs/fr/Atcm30_fr001_e.doc | title = Final Report, 30th Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting | publisher = [[Antarctic Treaty Secretariat]] | accessdate = 2 August 2007 | format = DOC }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.knet.co.za/antarctica/political.htm | title = Politics of Antarctica | accessdate = 5 February 2006 | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20050214014631/http://www.knet.co.za/antarctica/political.htm | archivedate = 14 February 2005 }}</ref>

There has been some concern over the potential adverse environmental and ecosystem effects caused by the influx of visitors. A call for stricter regulations for ships and a tourism quota has been made by some environmentalists and scientists.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/734551/Tourism-%27threatens-Antarctic%27.html | title = ''Tourism threatens Antarctic'' | publisher = Telegraph UK | accessdate = 5 February 2006 | location = London | first = Mark | last = Rowe | date = 11 February 2006 }}</ref> The primary response by Antarctic Treaty Parties has been to develop, through their Committee for Environmental Protection and in partnership with IAATO, "site use guidelines" setting landing limits and closed or restricted zones on the more frequently visited sites. Antarctic sight seeing flights (which did not land) operated out of Australia and New Zealand until the fatal crash of [[Air New Zealand Flight 901]] in 1979 on Mount Erebus, which killed all 257 aboard. [[Qantas]] resumed commercial overflights to Antarctica from Australia in the mid-1990s.

==Research==

[[File:Amundsen-Scott marsstation ray h edit.jpg|thumb|A [[full moon]] and 25-second exposure allowed sufficient light for this photo to be taken at [[Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station]] during the long Antarctic night. The station can be seen at far left, the [[power plant]] in the center and the mechanic's garage in the lower right. The green light in the background is the [[Aurora Australis]].]]

Each year, scientists from 28 different nations conduct [[experiment]]s not reproducible in any other place in the world. In the summer more than 4,000 scientists operate [[research station]]s; this number decreases to just over 1,000 in the winter.<ref name="CIAfactbook-People" /> [[McMurdo Station]], which is the largest research station in Antarctica, is capable of housing more than 1,000 scientists, visitors, and tourists.

Researchers include [[Biology|biologists]], [[Geology|geologists]], [[Oceanography|oceanographers]], [[Physics|physicists]], [[Astronomy|astronomers]], [[Glaciology|glaciologists]], and [[Meteorology|meteorologists]]. Geologists tend to study [[plate tectonics]], meteorites from [[outer space]], and resources from the breakup of the supercontinent [[Gondwanaland]]. Glaciologists in Antarctica are concerned with the study of the history and [[ice sheet dynamics|dynamics]] of floating ice, [[snow|seasonal snow]], [[glacier]]s, and [[ice sheet]]s. Biologists, in addition to examining the wildlife, are interested in how harsh temperatures and the presence of people affect adaptation and survival strategies in a wide variety of organisms. Medical physicians have made discoveries concerning the spreading of viruses and the body's response to extreme seasonal temperatures. Astrophysicists at [[Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station]] study the celestial dome and [[cosmic microwave background radiation]]. Many astronomical observations are better made from the interior of Antarctica than from most surface locations because of the high elevation, which results in a thin atmosphere, low temperature, which minimizes the amount of water vapour in the atmosphere, and absence of [[light pollution]], thus allowing for a view of space clearer than anywhere else on Earth. Antarctic ice serves as both the shield and the detection medium for the largest [[IceCube|neutrino telescope]] in the world, built {{convert|2|km|mi|abbr=on}} below Amundsen-Scott station.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.antarcticconnection.com/antarctic/science/index.shtml | title = Science in Antarctica | publisher = Antarctic Connection | accessdate = 4 February 2006 }}</ref>

Since the 1970s, an important focus of study has been the [[ozone layer]] in the [[atmosphere]] above Antarctica. In 1985, three British Scientists working on data they had gathered at [[Halley Station]] on the [[Brunt Ice Shelf]] discovered the existence of a hole in this layer. It was eventually determined that the destruction of the ozone was caused by [[chlorofluorocarbon]]s emitted by human products. With the ban of CFCs in the [[Montreal Protocol]] of 1989, it is believed that the ozone hole will close up by around 2065.<ref name="ozone record" /> In September 2006, [[NASA]] satellite data showed that the Antarctic [[ozone hole]] was the largest on record, covering 27.5&nbsp;million&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (10.6&nbsp;million&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi).<ref name="ozone record">{{cite web | url = http://www.nasa.gov/vision/earth/lookingatearth/ozone_record.html | title = NASA and NOAA Announce Ozone Hole is a Double Record Breaker | publisher = Goddard Space Flight Center, NASA | date = 19 October 2006 | accessdate = 6 September 2010 }}</ref>

On 6 September 2007, [[Belgian]]-based International Polar Foundation unveiled the [[Princess Elisabeth Base|Princess Elisabeth station]], the world's first zero-emissions polar science station in Antarctica to [[research]] [[climate change]]. Costing $16.3&nbsp;million, the [[prefabricated]] station, which is part of [[International Polar Year]], was shipped to the South Pole from [[Belgium]] by the end of 2008 to monitor the [[health]] of the [[polar region]]s. Belgian polar [[explorer]] [[Alain Hubert]] stated: "This base will be the first of its kind to produce zero emissions, making it a unique model of how energy should be used in the Antarctic." Johan Berte is the leader of the station design team and manager of the project which conducts research in [[climatology]], [[glaciology]] and [[microbiology]].<ref>[http://www.belspo.be/belspo/bepoles/science/station/index_en.stm belspo.be] <U+2013> Princess Elisabeth Station</ref>

In January 2008, the [[British Antarctic Survey]] (BAS) scientists, led by Hugh Corr and David Vaughan, reported (in the journal [[Nature Geoscience]]) that 2,200 years ago, a [[volcano]] erupted under Antarctica's ice sheet (based on [[aerial survey|airborne survey]] with radar images). The biggest eruption in Antarctica in the last 10,000 years, the volcanic ash was found deposited on the ice surface under the [[Hudson Mountains]], close to [[Pine Island Glacier]].<ref>{{cite news | last = Black | first = Richard | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7194579.stm | title = Ancient Antarctic eruption noted | publisher = BBC News | date = 20 January 2008 | accessdate = 7 February 2009 }}</ref>

===Meteorites===
[[File:ALH84001.jpg|thumb|left|Antarctic meteorite, named [[ALH84001]], from [[Mars]]]]
[[Meteorite]]s from Antarctica are an important area of study of material formed early in the [[solar system]]; most are thought to come from [[asteroid]]s, but some may have originated on larger [[planet]]s. The first meteorites were found in 1912. In 1969, a Japanese expedition discovered nine meteorites. Most of these meteorites have fallen onto the ice sheet in the last million years. Motion of the ice sheet tends to concentrate the meteorites at blocking locations such as mountain ranges, with wind erosion bringing them to the surface after centuries beneath accumulated snowfall. Compared with meteorites collected in more temperate regions on Earth, the Antarctic meteorites are well-preserved.<ref name="meteorite">{{cite web | url = http://www-curator.jsc.nasa.gov/antmet/index.cfm | title = Meteorites from Antarctica | publisher = NASA | accessdate = 9 February 2006 }}</ref>

This large collection of meteorites allows a better understanding of the abundance of meteorite types in the solar system and how meteorites relate to asteroids and comets. New types of meteorites and rare meteorites have been found. Among these are pieces blasted off the Moon, and probably Mars, by impacts. These specimens, particularly [[ALH84001]] discovered by [[ANSMET]], are at the center of the controversy about possible evidence of microbial life on Mars. Because meteorites in space absorb and record cosmic radiation, the time elapsed since the meteorite hit the Earth can be determined from laboratory studies. The elapsed time since fall, or terrestrial residence age, of a meteorite represents more information that might be useful in environmental studies of Antarctic ice sheets.<ref name="meteorite"/>

In 2006, a team of researchers from [[Ohio State University]] used gravity measurements by NASA's [[Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment|GRACE]] satellites to discover the {{convert|300|mi|km|-1|sing=on}}-wide [[Wilkes Land crater]], which probably formed about 250&nbsp;million years ago.<ref name="crater">{{Cite web|url=http://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/erthboom.htm|title=Big Bang in Antarctica<U+2014>Killer Crater Found Under Ice|publisher=Research News|first=Pam Frost|last=Gorder|date=1 June 2006}}</ref>

==Ice mass and global sea level==<!-- Link to this section from Current sea level rise -->
{{See also|Current sea level rise}}
[[File:Flow of Ice Across Antarctica.ogv|thumb|300px|The motion of ice in Antarctica]]

Due to its location at the South Pole, Antarctica receives relatively little solar radiation. This means that it is a very cold continent where water is mostly in the form of ice. Precipitation is low (most of Antarctica is a [[desert]]) and almost always in the form of snow, which accumulates and forms a giant ice sheet which covers the land. Parts of this ice sheet form moving glaciers known as [[ice streams]], which flow towards the edges of the continent. Next to the continental shore are many [[ice shelf|ice shelves]]. These are floating extensions of outflowing glaciers from the continental ice mass. Offshore, temperatures are also low enough that ice is formed from [[seawater]] through most of the year. It is important to understand the various types of Antarctic ice to understand possible effects on sea levels and the implications of global warming.

Sea ice extent expands annually in the Antarctic winter and most of this ice melts in the summer. This ice is formed from the ocean water and floats in the same water and thus does not contribute to rise in sea level. The [[Measurement of sea ice#Sea ice extent|extent]] of [[sea ice]] around Antarctica has remained roughly constant in recent decades, although the thickness changes are unclear.<ref name="United Nations Environment Programme">{{cite web | title = Regional changes in Arctic and Antarctic sea ice | publisher = United Nations Environment Programme | url = http://maps.grida.no/go/graphic/regional-changes-in-arctic-and-antarctic-sea-ice }}</ref><ref name="National Snow and Ice Data Center">{{cite web | title = All About Sea Ice | publisher = National Snow and Ice Data Center | url = http://nsidc.org/seaice/characteristics/difference.html }}</ref>

Melting of floating ice shelves (ice that originated on the land) does not in itself contribute much to sea-level rise (since the ice displaces only its own mass of water). However it is the outflow of the ice from the land to form the ice shelf which causes a rise in global sea level. This effect is offset by snow falling back onto the continent. Recent decades have witnessed several dramatic collapses of large ice shelves around the coast of Antarctica, especially along the Antarctic Peninsula. Concerns have been raised that disruption of ice shelves may result in increased glacial outflow from the continental ice mass.<ref name="RignotCasassa2004">{{cite doi|10.1029/2004GL020697}}</ref>

On the continent itself, the large volume of ice present stores around 70% of the world's fresh water.<ref name="howstuffworks" /> This ice sheet is constantly gaining ice from snowfall and losing ice through outflow to the sea. West Antarctica is currently experiencing a net outflow of glacial ice, which will increase global sea level over time. A review of the scientific studies looking at data from 1992 to 2006 suggested that a net loss of around 50 [[gigatonnes]] of ice per year was a reasonable estimate (around 0.14&nbsp;mm of sea level rise).<ref name="ShepherdWingham2007">{{cite doi|10.1126/science.1136776}}</ref> Significant acceleration of outflow glaciers in the [[Amundsen Sea Embayment]] may have more than doubled this figure for 2006.<ref name="RignotBamber2008">{{cite doi|10.1038/ngeo102}}</ref>

East Antarctica is a cold region with a ground base [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] and occupies most of the continent. This area is dominated by small accumulations of snowfall which becomes ice and thus eventually seaward glacial flows. The mass balance of the [[East Antarctic Ice Sheet]] as a whole is thought to be slightly positive (lowering sea level) or near to balance.<ref name="ShepherdWingham2007" /><ref name="RignotBamber2008" /> However, increased ice outflow has been suggested in some regions.<ref name="RignotBamber2008" /><ref name="ChenWilson2008">{{cite doi|10.1016/j.epsl.2007.10.057}}</ref>

Some of Antarctica has been warming up; particularly strong warming has been noted on the Antarctic Peninsula. A study by Eric Steig published in 2009 noted for the first time that the continent-wide average surface temperature trend of Antarctica is slightly positive at >0.05&nbsp;<U+00B0>C (0.09&nbsp;<U+00B0>F) per decade from 1957 to 2006. This study also noted that West Antarctica has warmed by more than 0.1&nbsp;<U+00B0>C (0.2&nbsp;<U+00B0>F) per decade in the last 50 years, and this warming is strongest in winter and spring. This is partly offset by fall cooling in East Antarctica.<ref name="SteigSchneider2009">{{cite doi|10.1038/nature07669}}</ref> There is evidence from one study that Antarctica is [[Global warming|warming]] as a result of human [[carbon dioxide]] emissions.<ref name="Gillett2008">{{cite doi|10.1038/ngeo338}}</ref> However, the small amount of surface warming in West Antarctica is not believed to be directly affecting the [[West Antarctic Ice Sheet]]'s contribution to sea level.

{{Main|Ozone depletion}}

Each year a large area of low ozone concentration or "[[ozone hole]]" grows over Antarctica. This hole covers the whole continent and is at its largest in September. 2008 saw the longest lasting hole on record, which remained until the end of December.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Antarctic Ozone|author=British Antarctic Survey, Meteorology and Ozone Monitoring Unit|publisher=Natural Environment Research Council|url=http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/met/jds/ozone/index.html|accessdate=5 May 2009}}</ref> The hole was detected by scientists in 1985<ref name="schiermeier2009">{{Cite journal|title=Atmospheric science: Fixing the sky|author=Schiermeier, Quirin|url=http://www.nature.com/news/2009/090812/full/460792a.html|journal=Nature|publisher=Nature Publishing Group|doi=10.1038/460792a|date=12 August 2009|volume=460|pages=792<U+2013>795|accessdate=7 October 2009}}</ref> and has tended to increase over the years of observation. The ozone hole is attributed to the [[Atmospheric emissions|emission]] of [[chlorofluorocarbon]]s or CFCs into the atmosphere, which decompose the [[ozone]] into other gases.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nas.nasa.gov/About/Education/Ozone/antarctic.html|title=The Antarctic Ozone hole|author=National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Advanced Supercomputing Division (NAS)|publisher=Government of the United States|date=26 June 2001|accessdate=7 February 2009}}</ref>

Some scientific studies suggest that ozone depletion may have a dominant role in the recent climate changes in Antarctica (and a wider area of the Southern Hemisphere).<ref name="schiermeier2009"/> Ozone absorbs large amounts of ultraviolet radiation in the [[stratosphere]]. Ozone depletion over Antarctica can cause a cooling of around 6&nbsp;<U+00B0>C in the local stratosphere. This cooling has the effect of intensifying the westerly winds which flow around the continent (the [[polar vortex]]) and thus prevents outflow of the cold air near the South Pole. As a result, the continental mass of the East Antarctic ice sheet is held at lower temperatures, and the peripheral areas of Antarctica, especially the Antarctic Peninsula, are subject to higher temperatures, which promote accelerated melting.<ref name="schiermeier2009"/> Recent models also suggest that the ozone depletion/enhanced polar vortex effect also accounts for the recent increase in sea-ice just offshore of the continent.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Turner J., Comiso J.C., Marshall G.J., Lachlan-Cope T.A., Bracegirdle T., Maksym T., Meredith M.P., Wang Z., Orr A.|title=Non-annular atmospheric circulation change induced by stratospheric ozone depletion and its role in the recent increase of Antarctic sea ice extent|journal=[[Geophysical Research Letters]]|volume=36|pages=L08502|year=2009|doi=10.1029/2009GL037524|bibcode=2009GeoRL..3608502T|issue=8}}</ref>
