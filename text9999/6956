Shortly after taking power in 1949, the [[Communist Party of China]] embarked upon a series of campaigns that purportedly eradicated [[prostitution]] from [[mainland China]] by the early 1960s. Since the loosening of government controls over society in the early 1980s, '''prostitution in mainland China''' not only has become more visible, but can now be found throughout both [[Urban area|urban]] and rural areas. In spite of government efforts, prostitution has now developed to the extent that it comprises an industry, one that involves a great number of people and produces a considerable [[Output (economics)|economic output]]. Prostitution has also become associated with a number of problems, including [[organized crime]], [[government corruption]] and [[sexually transmitted disease]]s. For example, a Communist Party official who was a top provincial campaigner against corruption was removed from his post after he was caught in a hotel room with a prostitute.<ref>"[http://news.monstersandcritics.com/asiapacific/news/article_1290358.php/Chinese_anti-corruption_official_sacked_for_Russian_tryst Chinese anti-corruption official sacked for Russian tryst]".

Prostitution-related activities in mainland China are characterised by diverse types, [[Distribution (business)|venues]] and [[price]]s. Prostitutes themselves come from a broad range of social backgrounds. They are almost all female, though in recent years male prostitutes have also emerged. A large number of [[Russian people|Russian]] women work as prostitutes in China.<ref name=Vlad>Khabalov, Dmitry; Gurko, Fyodor (15 December 2000).

Officially, prostitution is illegal in mainland China.<ref>{{cite web | date=25 February 2009 | accessdate=8 May 2009 | publisher=[[United States Department of State]] | url=http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2008/eap/119037.htm | title=2008 Human Rights Report: China (includes Tibet, Hong Kong, and Macau) }} Section 5: Discrimination, Societal Abuse, and Trafficking in Persons.</ref> The [[government of China]] has vacillated, however, in its legal treatment of prostitutes themselves, treating them sometimes as [[crime|criminals]] and sometimes as behaving with [[misconduct]]. Since the reemergence of prostitution in the 1980s, government authorities have responded by first using the [[legal system]], that is, the daily operations of institutions like [[court]]s and police. Second, they have relied on police-led campaigns, clearly delineated periods of intense public activity, as a form of social discipline. Despite lobbying by international [[NGO]]s and overseas commentators, there is not much support for [[legalisation]] of the sex sector by the public, [[social organization]]s or the government of the PRC.

While the sale of sexual intercourse remains illegal throughout mainland China, as of 2013 [[erotic massage]], or more commonly known as massage with "happy endings," is legal in the city of Foshan in Guangdong province. In June of that year, the Foshan Court determined that the sale of erotic massage is not the same as prostitution.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/27/china-happy-endings-legal_n_3512037.html | work=Huffington Post | first=Carlo | last=Davis | title='Happy Endings' Just Got A Little Happier In China | date=27 June 2013}}</ref>

Different ethnic groups had different attitudes toward prostitution. The Europeans noted that Turki Muslims ([[Uyghur people|Uyghur]]s) would [[prostitute]] their daughters, while such a thing would never happen among Tungan Muslims ([[Hui people|Chinese Muslims]]), which was why Turkic prostitutes were common around the country.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=lThtAAAAMAAJ&q=For+these+and+other+reasons+the+country+is+filled+with+Turki+prostitutes,+which+one+would+scarcely+ever+see+among+the+Tungan&dq=For+these+and+other+reasons+the+country+is+filled+with+Turki+prostitutes,+which+one+would+scarcely+ever+see+among+the+Tungan&hl=en&ei=yTnQTNCCLMH6lwfTzbC1Bg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA|title=Bamberger Zentralasienstudien|author=Ingeborg Baldauf, Michael Friederich|year=1994|publisher=Schwarz|location=|page=352|isbn=3-87997-235-4|pages=|accessdate=28 June 2010}}</ref>

===Tanka Prostitution===
Elizabeth Wheeler Andrew (1845<U+2013>1917) and Katharine Caroline Bushnell (5 February 1856 January 26, 1946), who wrote extensively on the position of women in the British Empire, wrote about the [[Tanka people|Tanka]] inhabitants of Hong Kong and their position in the prostitution industry, catering towards foreign sailors. The Tanka did not marry with the Chinese, being descendants of the natives, they were restricted to the waterways.

===Prostitution during the Maoist era===
Following the [[Communist Party of China]]'s victory in 1949, local government authorities were charged with the task of eliminating prostitution. One month after the Communist takeover of [[Beijing]] on 3 February 1949, the new [[Municipality of China|municipal government]] under [[Ye Jianying]] announced a policy to control the city's many [[brothel]]s. On 21 November, all 224 of Beijing's establishments were shut down; 1286 prostitutes and 434 owners, procurers, and [[pimp]]s were arrested in the space of 12 hours by an estimated 2400 [[Professional revolutionaries|cadres]].<ref>"[http://web.archive.org/web/20020514193047/http://www.booker.com.cn/gb/paper23/23/class002300006/hwz162063.htm <U+7F57><U+745E><U+537F><U+4E00><U+591C><U+626B><U+9664><U+5317><U+5E73><U+5993><U+5973> (Luo Ruiqing eradicates Beiping's prostitutes in a single night)]". 2000.

Due to the enormity of [[social issues]] that had to be addressed, and the limited budgets and human resources of local governments, most cities adopted the slower approach of first controlling and then prohibiting brothel-prostitution.<ref>Ed.

The combined effect of such measures was to gradually reduce the number of brothels in each city until the point where a "Beijing-style" closure of the remaining brothels was deemed feasible and [[Re-education through labor|reeducation]] could begin. Reeducation programs were undertaken on the largest scale in [[Shanghai]], where the number of sex workers had grown to 100,000 following the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]].

By the early 1960s, such measures had basically wiped out visible forms of prostitution from mainland China. According to the PRC government, venereal diseases were almost completely eliminated from the mainland contemporaneously with the control of prostitution. To mark this victory, all 29 venereal disease research institutes were closed in 1964.

In accordance with [[Marxism|Marxist theory]], women who sold sex were viewed as being forced into prostitution in order to survive. The eradication of prostitution was thus vaunted as one of the major accomplishments of the Communist government and evidence of the primacy of [[Chinese Marxism]].<ref>[[Information Office of the State Council|Information Office of the State Council of the People's Republic of China]].

The resurgence of prostitution in mainland China has coincided with the introduction of [[Deng Xiaoping]]'s [[Chinese economic reform|liberalisation of Chinese economic policy]] in 1978.

Prostitution is often directly linked to low-level government corruption. Many local officials believe that encouraging prostitution in recreational business operations will bring economic benefits by developing the tourism and hospitality industries and generating a significant source of tax revenue.<ref>Anderson A. and Gil V. (1999). "Prostitution and public policy in the People's Republic of China: an analysis of the rehabilitative ideal".''International Criminal Justice Review'' '''4''' (23). p. 28.</ref> On occasion, police have been implicated in the running of high grade hotels where prostitution activities occur, or accepting bribes and demanding sexual favours to ignore the existence of prostitution activities.<ref>Malhotra, A.

==Foreign prostitutes in China==

===North Korean prostitutes in China===
North Korean women are increasingly falling victim to sex exploitation in China attempting to escape poverty and harsh conditions in their homeland.

== Prostitution in Hong Kong and Macau ==
[[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]] are [[special administrative region]]s of China and subject to different laws: [[prostitution in Hong Kong]] is legal, as is [[prostitution in Macau]]. This has led to a higher incidence of prostitution in these regions than in mainland China. Women travel from [[mainland China]] to Hong Kong and Macau in order to engage in the trade. There are also allegations of women being trafficked for the purpose. The trafficked women are said to come from mainland China, [[Mongolia]], [[Southeast Asia]], [[Europe]], and [[South Africa]].<ref>[http://mg.co.za/article/2007-10-18-sa-a-humantrafficking-hot-spot-conference-hears SA a human-trafficking hot spot, conference hears]</ref><ref name="gvnet">{{cite web|url=http://gvnet.com/humantrafficking/Macau.htm|title=Human Trafficking &amp; Modern-day Slavery - Macau|publisher=gvnet.com|accessdate=1 October 2014}}</ref>

==Types and venues==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2008}}

Chinese police categorise prostitution practices according to a descending hierarchy of seven tiers, though this typology does not exhaust the forms of practices that exist.<ref>"[http://web.archive.org/web/20010115002400/http://www.amrc.org.hk/Arch/3303.htm Sex Work in China]". Asia Monitor Resource Centre. Retrieved 23 April 2009. Archived from [http://www.amrc.org.hk/Arch/3303.htm the original] on 15 January 2001.</ref> These tiers highlight the heterogeneous nature of prostitution and prostitutes. While they are all classified as prostitutes, the services they offer can be very different. Within some tiers, for example, there is still some revulsion to the acts of [[anal sex]] and [[oral sex]]. In parallel with the wide range of backgrounds for prostitutes, male buyers of sex also come from a wide range of occupational backgrounds. According to the local police, in China there are seven categories of prostitutes:<ref>{{cite web|title=Prostitution in contemporary China The case of Shanghai Jiading |url=http://lup.lub.lu.se/luur/download?func=downloadFile&recordOId=1328797&fileOId=1328798 |date=2006|author=Niklas Dougherty|publisher=Lund university|page=16|accessdate=23 August 2104}}</ref>

;First tier - ''baoernai'' (<U+5305><U+4E8C><U+5976>):Women who act as the "second wives" of men with money and influential positions, including government officials and entrepreneurs from the mainland, as well as overseas businessmen. This practice is defined as prostitution on the grounds that women in question actively solicit men who can provide them with fixed-term accommodation and a regular allowance. Women who engage in these acts will sometimes co-habit with their "clients" and may even have ambitions to become a real wife. Illegal online <U+201C>College Concubine Agencies<U+201D> have appeared, charging a fee to put men in contact with female university students who wish to become mistresses.<ref>{{cite news|title=Degrading Online Mistress Ads Pimp Out Chinese University Students|url=http://www.echinacities.com/china-media/Degrading-Online-Mistress-Ads-Pimp-Out-Chinese-University-Students|publisher=eChinacities (originally [[Xinhua News Agency]])|date=18 May 2011|accessdate=23 August 2014}}</ref>

;Second tier - ''baopo'' (<U+5305><U+5A46> "packaged wife"): Women who accompany high class clients for a fixed duration of time, for example, during the course of a business trip, and receive a set payment for doing so.
[[File:Pimp business card.jpg|thumb|[[tart card|Pimps give out their business cards]] to potential customers. A prostitute can be sent to a hotel room upon request.]]
The first and second tiers have become the focus of heated public debate because they are explicitly linked to [[government corruption]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} Many domestic commentators contend that these practices constitute a concrete expression of "[[bourgeois]] rights".<ref>Pan, pp. 52<U+2013>7, note 18.</ref> The [[All-China Women's Federation]], as one of the major vehicles of [[feminism]] in the PRC, as well as women's groups in [[Hong Kong]] and [[Taiwan]], have been actively involved in efforts to eradicate this form of "[[concubine|concubinage]]" as practices that violate the emotional and economic surety of the marriage contract.<ref>Act of the People's Republic of China for Security Administration Punishment.</ref>

;Third tier - ''santing'' (<U+4E09><U+5385> "three halls"):
[[File:Barber shop Bao'an Shenzhen China.jpg|thumb|A hair salon where prostitutes work in [[Bao'an District]], [[Shenzhen]]. Brothels are often disguised as hair salons, or they operate out of working hair salons.]]
Women who perform sexual acts with men in [[karaoke]]/[[Nightclub|dance]] venues, [[bar (establishment)|bars]], restaurants, [[teahouse]]s and other venues and who receive financial recompense in the form of [[gratuity|tip]]s from the individual men they accompany, as well as from a share of the profits generated by informal [[service charge]]s on the use of facilities and the consumption of food and beverages. A common [[euphemism]] for such hostesses is ''sanpei xiaojie'' (<U+4E09><U+966A><U+5C0F><U+59D0>: "ladies of the three accompaniments"). In theory, the "three accompaniments" are chatting, drinking and dancing with their clients. In practice, the "three accompaniments" more often refers to dancing with, drinking with, and being publicly groped by their clients. These women often begin by allowing their clients to fondle or intimately caress their bodies, then if the client is eager, will engage in [[sexual intercourse]].

;Fourth tier - "doorbell girls" (<U+53EE><U+549A><U+5C0F><U+59D0> "dingdong ladies"): Women who solicit potential buyers of sex by [[cold calling|phoning]] rooms in a given hotel.

;Fifth tier - ''falangmei'' (<U+53D1><U+5ECA><U+59B9> "hairdressing salon sisters"):Women who work in places that offer commercial sexual services under the guise of [[massage]] or health and beauty treatments; for instance, in health and fitness centres, [[Beauty salon|beauty parlours]], [[barber|barber shops]], [[Public bathing|bathhouses]] and [[sauna]]s. Common activities in these premises are [[masturbation]] or [[oral sex]].

;Sixth tier - ''jien<U+00FC>'' (<U+8857><U+5973> "street girls"):Women who solicit male buyers of sex on the streets.

;Seventh tier - ''xiagongpeng'' (<U+4E0B><U+5DE5><U+68DA> "down the work shack"):Women who sell sex to the transient labour force of male workers from the rural countryside.

The lowest two tiers are characterised by a more straightforward exchange of sex for financial or material recompense. They are neither explicitly linked to government corruption, nor directly mediated through China's new commercial recreational business sector. Women who sell sex in the lowest two tiers usually do so in return for small sums of money, food and shelter.

==Legal responses==
The PRC rejects the argument that prostitution is an unremarkable transaction between consenting individuals and that prohibition laws constitute a violation of [[civil liberties]]. Overall, the PRC's legal response to prostitution is to penalise third party organisers of prostitution. Participants in the prostitution transaction are still usually penalised according to the Chinese system of [[administrative law|administrative sanctions]], rather than through the [[criminal code]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

===Prostitution law===
{{Prostitution in the People's Republic of China}}

Until the 1980s, the subject of prostitution was not viewed as a major concern for the [[National People's Congress]]. The PRC's first criminal code, the [[Criminal Law and the Criminal Procedure Law]] of 1979 made no explicit reference to the activities of prostitutes and prostitute clients.<ref>''Criminal Law and the Criminal Procedure Law of the People's Republic of China''. Beijing: Foreign Languages Press (1984). Articles 140, 169.</ref> Legal control of prostitution was effected on the basis of [[Province of China|provincial]] rulings and localised policing initiatives until the introduction of the "Security administration punishment regulations" in 1987. The Regulations makes it an offence to "sell sex" (<U+5356><U+6DEB>) and to "have illicit relations with a prostitute" (<U+5AD6><U+5BBF><U+6697><U+5A3C>).<ref>Note 15, Article 30, at 695<U+2013>6.</ref>

Prostitution only became a distinct object of [[statute|statutory]] classification in the early 1990s. Responding to requests from the [[Ministry of Public Security (PRC)|Ministry of Public Security]] and the [[All-China Women's Federation]], the [[National People's Congress]] passed legislation that significantly expanded the range and scope of prostitution controls: the 1991 Decision on Strictly Forbidding the Selling and Buying of Sex and the 1991 Decision on the Severe Punishment of Criminals Who Abduct and Traffic in or Kidnap Women and Children.<ref>Quanguo renda changweihui, xingfashi bianzhu, fazhi gongzuo weiyuanhui (Criminal Law Office and the Legal Council of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress) (1991). <U+5173><U+4E8E><U+4E25><U+7981><U+5356><U+6DEB><U+5AD6><U+5A3C><U+7684><U+51B3><U+5B9A><U+548C><U+5173><U+4E8E><U+4E25><U+60E9><U+62D0><U+5356><U+7ED1><U+67B6><U+5987><U+5973><U+513F><U+7AE5><U+7684><U+72AF><U+7F6A><U+5206><U+5B50><U+7684><U+51B3><U+5B9A> (''An Explanation of the Decision on Strictly Forbidding the Selling and Buying of Sex and the Decision on the Severe Punishment of Criminals Who Abduct and Traffic in or Kidnap Women and Children''). Zhonggguo jiancha chubanshe.</ref> Adding symbolic weight to these enhanced law enforcement controls was the 1992 Law on Protecting the Rights and Interests of Women, which defines prostitution as a social practice that abrogates the inherent rights of women to personhood.<ref>Articles 36, 37.</ref>

The PRC's revised [[Criminal Law]] of 1997 retains its abolitionist focus in that it is primarily concerned with criminalising third-party involvement in prostitution. For the first time the death penalty may be used, but only in exceptional cases of organising prostitution activities, involving additional circumstances such as repeated offences, rape, causing serious [[Bodily harm|bodily injury]], etc.<ref>''1997 Criminal Code of the People's Republic of China'' trans.

The 1997 criminal code codified provisions in the 1991 Decision, establishing a system of controls over social place, specifically places of leisure and entertainment.<ref>Note 19, Articles 361, 362, at 187<U+2013>8.</ref> The ultimate goal is to stop managers and workers within the predominantly male-run and male-patronised [[Hospitality industry|hospitality and service industry]] from profiting from and/or encouraging the prostitution of others. Government intervention in commercial recreation has found concrete expression in the form of the 1999 "Regulations concerning the management of public places of entertainment". The provisions proscribe a range of commercial practices that characterise the activities of female "hostesses".<ref><U+4E2D><U+534E><U+4EBA><U+6C11><U+5171><U+548C><U+56FD><U+56FD><U+52A1><U+9662> guowuyuan (State Council of the PRC) (1999). <U+5A31><U+4E50><U+573A><U+6240><U+7BA1><U+7406><U+6761><U+4F8B> (''Regulations concerning the management of public places of entertainment''). Wenhua chubanshe. Articles 132, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138.</ref> These laws have been further reinforced via the introduction of localised licensing measures that bear directly on the interior spatial organisation of recreational venues.

===Party disciplinary measures===
As a result of strong calls to curb official corruption, during the mid to late 1990s, a whole host of regulations were also introduced to ban government employees both from running recreational venues and from protecting illegal business operations. The 1997 Communist Party Discipline Regulations, for example, contain specific provisions to the effect that party members will be stripped of their posts for using their position and/or public funds to keep a "second wife", a "hired wife", and to buy sexual services.<ref>"Communist Party discipline regulations". Xinhua News Agency, 1999., trans. ''Selected World Broadcasts - China'', 14 April, FE/2892 S2/1-18.</ref> These measures are being policed via the practice established in 1998 of [[audit]]ing government officials, and thereby combining the forces of the CPC's disciplinary committees with those of the State Auditing Administration. Following the introduction of these measures, the [[Media of China|Chinese media]] has publicised numerous cases of government officials being convicted and disciplined for abusing their positions for prostitution.<ref>For example, "Guangdong court judge sacked for hiring prostitutes" [[Xinhua]], 26 September 2000.</ref>

==Policing==
Despite the position of the law, prostitutes are often treated as quasi-criminals by the [[Ministry of Public Security of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Public Security]]. Chinese police conduct regular patrols of [[public space]]s, often with the support of mass-line organisations, using a strong presence as a deterrence against prostitution. Because lower tier prostitutes work the streets, they are more likely to be apprehended. Arrests are also more likely to be female sellers of sex than male buyers of sex. The overwhelming majority of men and women who are apprehended are released with a caution and [[fine (penalty)|fine]].<ref>Jeffreys, note 6 at 107.</ref>

In response, sellers and buyers of sex have adopted a wide range of tactics designed to avoid apprehension. The spatial mobility which is afforded by modern communications systems, such as mobile phones and [[pager]]s, and by modern forms of transportation, such as [[taxicab|taxis]] and [[Automobile|private cars]], has severely reduced the ability of police to determine exactly who is engaged in acts of solicitation.<ref>Ouyang Tao (1994) "Dangjin woguo maiyin piaochang fanzui de zhuangshi tedian ji duice" [<U+5F53><U+4ECA><U+6211><U+56FD><U+5356><U+6DEB><U+5AD6><U+5A3C><U+72AF><U+7F6A><U+7684><U+58EE><U+5B9E><U+7279><U+70B9><U+53CA><U+5BF9><U+7B56>: Prostitution offences in contemporary China: characteristics and countermeasures], ''Fanzui yu gaizao yanjiu'', 10: 15<U+2013>18.</ref> Prostitutes have also begun using the internet, in particular [[instant messaging]] software such as [[Tencent QQ|QQ]], to attract customers.<ref>[http://society.dayoo.com/gb/content/2005-10/13/content_2254667.htm 23<U+5C81>"<U+5988><U+54AA>"<U+7F51><U+4E0A><U+4ECB><U+7ECD><U+5C0F><U+59D0> <U+79F0><U+5B66><U+751F><U+5305><U+591C>600] (23-year-old "Mummy" introduces ladies on the internet, students for 600 a night). Retrieved 25 November 2005.</ref> In 2004, PlayChina, an online prostitution referral service, was shut down by police.

In tandem with the long-term task of developing preventative policing, the much more visible form of policing have been periodic police-led campaigns. Anti-prostitution campaigns have been accompanied by nationwide "media blitzes" to publicise the PRC's laws and regulations. This is typically followed by the announcement of arrest statistics, and then by sober official statements suggesting that the struggle to eliminate prostitution will be a long one. The use of campaigns has been criticised for their reliance on an outdated "ideological" construction and an equally outmoded campaign formula of the 1950s.<ref>Hershatter, G., ''Dangerous Pleasures: Prostitution and Modernity in Twentieth-Century Shanghai'' (Berkeley, CA: University of California Press) at 363.</ref>

The primary target of the PRC's prostitution controls throughout the 1990s has been China's burgeoning hospitality and entertainment industry. These culminated in the "strike hard" campaigns of late 1999 and 2000. Whilst such campaigns may have failed to eradicate prostitution ''in toto'', there is some evidence that regulation of China's recreational venues has helped to create a legitimate female service worker with the right to refuse to engage in practices repugnant to the "valid labour contract", as well as the right to be free from [[sexual harassment]] in the workplace.<ref>Jeffreys, E., "Feminist prostitution debates: Are there any sex workers in China?" in McLaren, A. E., Chinese Women - Living and Working (London: RoutledgeCurzon, 2004) at 98.</ref>

Chinese police have, however, proven unable to effectively police higher tier prostitution practices. The nature of concubinage and second wife practices makes it more suited as a target of social action campaigns rather than conventional police action. Because of social changes, for example, Chinese police are now professionally constrained not to intrude on people's personal relationships in an overt or coercive manner.<ref>Jeffreys, note 41 at 94.</ref> Police forces around China also differ as to how they approach the subject. In some areas, "massage parlours" on main streets are known full well to be brothels, but are generally left to function without hindrance, barring occasional raids.

==The question of legalisation==
The illegal activities and problems associated with prostitution had led some to believe that there would be benefits if prostitution was legalized.

A number of international [[NGO]]s and [[human rights]] organisations have criticised the PRC government for failing to comply with the UN [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]], accusing PRC of penalising and abusing lower tier prostitutes, many of whom are victims of human trafficking, while exonerating men who buy sex, and ignoring the ongoing problems of governmental complicity and involvement in the sex trade industry.<ref>Human Rights in China [http://www.hrichina.org/fs/downloadables/pdf/downloadable-resources/cedaw_98.pdf?revision_id=14195 Can dialogue improve China's human rights situation? Report on the implementation of CEDAW in the People's Republic of China], 2000. Retrieved 2 December 2005.</ref> The [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]] reads: ''Art. 6'': ''States Parties shall take all appropriate measures, including legislation, to suppress all forms of traffic in women and exploitation of prostitution of women''. However, it does not advocate a system of [[Regulated prostitution|legal and regulated prostitution]]. [http://www.ippf.org/en/Resources/Statements/The+Right+to+be+Free+from+Torture+and+Ill+Treatment.htm] There has, though, been some calls for legalization; a minor rally for this caused was held in 2010 organized by sex worker activist Ye Haiyan, who was arrested by police for her role in organizing the protests.<ref name="whatsonxiamen">{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/http://www.whatsonxiamen.com/news13800.html|title=Sex worker Ye Haiyan held in China's 1st rally to legalize prostitution - What's On Xiamen|publisher=web.archive.org|accessdate=1 October 2014}}</ref>

Central guidelines laid down by the CPC do not permit the public advocacy of the legalisation of prostitution. Arguments concerning legalisation are not absent, however, from mainland China. On the contrary, some commentators contend that legally recognising the sex industry, in conjunction with further economic development, will ultimately reduce the number of women in prostitution.<ref>Zhang Beichuan, Chen Guanzhi, Li Kefu and Li Xiufang "Zhonggguo mou chengshi jin<U+00FC> diaocha" [<U+4E2D><U+56FD><U+67D0><U+57CE><U+5E02><U+5993><U+5973><U+8C03><U+67E5>: "A survey of female prostitutes in a Chinese city"], note 6.</ref> Domestic commentators have also been highly critical of the PRC's prostitution controls, with a consistent [[Marxist]]-informed focus of complaint being the gender-biased and discriminatory nature of such controls, as well as human rights abuses.<ref>See for example Pan, note 6.</ref> Some commentators in China and overseas contend that the PRC's policy of banning prostitution is problematic because it hinders the task of developing measures to prevent the spread of HIV.<ref>Li Dun (1996) "Dui aizibing yu maiyin de zhengce he fal<U+00FC> pingjia" [<U+5BF9><U+827E><U+6ECB><U+75C5><U+4E0E><U+5356><U+6DEB><U+7684><U+653F><U+7B56><U+548C><U+6CD5><U+5F8B><U+8BC4><U+4EF7>: "An evaluation of China's policies and laws concerning AIDS and prostitution"] note 6 at 16<U+2013>17.</ref>

While prostitution controls have been relaxed at a local level,{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} there is no impetus for legalisation at the central government level. Importantly, legalisation does not have much public support.<ref>Zhang Zhiping "Does China need a red-light district?", ''Beijing Review'', 12 June 2000 at 28<U+2013>33; Settle, E., [http://www.casy.org/engdocs/SCMP_Oped_072904.pdf Legalise prostitution in China], ''South China Morning Post'', 29 July 2004. Retrieved 2 December 2005.</ref> Given the underdeveloped nature of the Chinese economy and legal system, there is an argument that legalisation would further complicate the already difficult task of establishing the legal responsibility for third-party involvement in forced prostitution and the traffic in women.<ref>Peratis, K. and Flores, J.R.

These include the lack of independent [[trade union]]s, and limited access of individuals to civil redress with regard to [[occupational health and safety]] issues.<ref>Jeffreys, note 7 at 128.</ref>

==HIV/AIDS==
{{main|HIV/AIDS in China}}
According to [[UNAIDS]], 0.5% of Chinese sex workers are infected with [[HIV]].<ref name= "cnn report">{{cite news |url= http://edition.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/asiapcf/06/19/china.aids.prostitutes/|title= China tries to stop spread of HIV/AIDS among prostitutes|author= |date= 21 June 2009|work= |publisher= CNN|accessdate=24 November 2009}}</ref> One study reported that 5% of low-cost sex workers were infected.<ref name="elderly">{{cite web |url= http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/life/2010-01/11/content_9297255.htm|title= AIDS and the elderly|author= |date= 11 January 2010|work= |publisher= China Daily|accessdate=12 January 2010}}</ref> In one part of [[Yunnan]] province, the infection rate is estimated to be as high as 7%.

==Prostitution in the media==
The spread of prostitution practices has introduced a large quantity of [[slang]] to the popular vocabulary. Prostitution is a popular subject in the media, especially on the internet. Typically news of police raids, court cases or family tragedies related to prostitution are published in a sensationalised form. A good example is news of an orgy between 400 Japanese clients and 500 Chinese prostitutes in 2003, which partially because of [[anti-Japanese sentiment]], was widely publicised and met with considerable outrage.<ref>[http://english.people.com.cn/200309/27/eng20030927_125049.shtml Japanese orgy in Zhuhai hotel sparks Chinese fury], ''People's Daily'', 27 September 2003. Retrieved 2 December 2005.</ref> Another highly publicised case was that of [[Alex Ho Wai-to]], then a [[Democratic Party of Hong Kong|Democratic Party]] candidate for the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong]], who was given a six-month [[re-education through labor]] sentence for hiring a prostitute.<ref>Zheng Caixiong, [http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2004-08/18/content_366425.htm HK LegCo candidate arrested for taking prostitutes], ''China Daily'', 18 August 2004. Retrieved 2 December 2005.</ref>

Prostitution has emerged as a subject of art in recent years, particularly in [[Chinese cinema]]. [[Li Shaohong]]'s 1995 film ''[[Blush (film)|Blush]]'' begins in 1949 with the rounding up of prostitutes in [[Shanghai]] for "[[Reeducation through labor|reeducation]]", and proceeds to tell the story of a [[love triangle]] between two prostitutes and one of their former clients. One of the prostitutes, Xiaoe, attempts to hang herself in reeducation. When asked to explain the reason, she says she was born in the brothel and enjoyed her lifestyle there - thereby challenging the government-sanctioned perspective of prostitution. The 1998 film ''[[Xiu Xiu: The Sent Down Girl]]'' was a dramatic portrayal of "invisible" prostitution in the rural China during the Maoist era.

The 2001 independent film ''[[Seafood (film)|Seafood]]'', by [[Zhu Wen (director)|Zhu Wen]], was an even more frank depiction of prostitution, this time of the complicated relationship between prostitution and law enforcement. In the film, a Beijing prostitute goes to a seaside resort to commit [[suicide]]. Her attempt is intervened by a police officer who tries to redeem her, but also inflicts upon her many instances of [[sexual assault]]. Both films, whilst being critically acclaimed abroad, performed poorly in mainland China, only partially due to government restrictions on distribution. The depiction of prostitution in fiction, by comparison, has fared slightly better. The most notable author on the subject is the young writer [[Jiu Dan]], whose portrayal of Chinese prostitutes in [[Singapore]] in her [[novel]] ''Wuya'', was extremely controversial.<ref>Jiu Dan, ''Wuya'' [<U+4E4C><U+9E26>: Crows] (Changjiang wenyi chubanshe, 2001).</ref>
