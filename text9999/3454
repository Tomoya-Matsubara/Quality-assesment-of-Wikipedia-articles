}}'''Alphonse "Buddy" Fletcher, Jr.''' (born 1966) is an African-American [[philanthropist]] who had previously been a successful [[money manager]].  Fletcher first became notable when employed by [[Kidder, Peabody & Co.]]  During this time, he had an agreement entitling him to 25% of the profits he earned for the firm.  However, when he generated $25 million one year, the firm did not uphold its agreement, and Fletcher sued for racial discrimination and [[US$]]3 million in back pay.  He eventually won an arbitration award of $1.3 million.

Fletcher had worked at [[Bear Stearns]] before working for Kidder and founded his own firm, Fletcher Asset Management, after the dispute with Kidder Peabody. Having donated tens of millions of dollars to various charitable causes, Fletcher has become a major philanthropist.  He has established several lasting legacies with his charitable efforts; two such efforts include the establishment of the [[Fletcher Foundation]] and the endowment of a [[Harvard University Professor|University Professorship]] at [[Harvard University]].  He has also been a serious contender for statewide public office in the United States state of [[New York]].

== Early life and education ==
Fletcher's first experience with investment, risk and return occurred when he was in junior high school.  He and his father developed a computer program to determine dogs to invest in at the [[dog racing]] tracks.  His program was able to select dogs that would win place or show, but due to the odds of the dogs it was selecting and the [[Commission (remuneration)|commission]] that the [[race track]] extracted, his work was not profitable.<ref name="SMW">{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=0DE0dBXG15AC&pg=PT144&lpg=PT144&dq=Fletcher+Kidder+dividend&source=web&ots=VNqq_ibj7C&sig=umnzxL8g3hu_wEzugl7PZpQ4MF8&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=4&ct=result#PPT135,M1|title=Stock Market Wizards: Interviews with America's Top Stock Traders|author=Schwager, Jack D.|isbn=0066620597|edition=Rev Upd edition|date=2003|publisher=Collins Business}}</ref>

He attended [[Harvard College]] where he received an [[Bachelor of Arts|A.B.]] degree as an [[applied mathematics]] major in 1987.<ref name="UPNfF">{{cite web|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/1996/04.25/UniversityProfe.html|title=University Professorship Named for Fletcher: Honors graduate of Harvard Class of 1987|accessdate=2008-09-12|date=1996-04-25|publisher=President and Fellows of Harvard College|work=Harvard University Gazette|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060903162721/http://www.hno.harvard.edu/gazette/1996/04.25/UniversityProfe.html |archivedate = September 03, 2006|deadurl=yes}}</ref>  He was elected first marshall (class president) of the 1987 class.<ref name="PCFsim" />  He earned a [[Master<U+2019>s degree]] in Environmental Management from the [[Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://home.nycap.rr.com/businessteacher/Index_files/Page564.htm|title=Alphonse Fletcher, Jr.|accessdate=2008-09-12|author=Dipnarine, Danny,  James Kocienski, and Apollo Marmarinos|publisher=Michael Hover}} {{dead link| date=June 2010 | bot=DASHBot}}</ref>  While an undergraduate student, he was enrolled in the [[United States Air Force]] [[Reserve Officers' Training Corps]] Aerospace Studies Program at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].<ref name="AFJ">{{cite web|url=http://www.fletcher.com/alphonse.html|title=Alphonse Fletcher, Jr.|accessdate=2008-09-12|publisher=Fletcher Asset Management}}</ref>  Upon graduation, he was commissioned as a [[lieutenant|second lieutenant]] and served in the United States Air Force Ready Reserve until his [[honorable discharge]] in 1997.<ref name="PCFsim" /><ref name="AFJ" />

One of his college internships was with [[Pfizer]], where through the [[employee stock ownership program]] he learned the principal of investing in discounted assets.  This was his first experience purchasing stocks.<ref name="SMW"/>

== Professional career ==
The United States National [[Defense (military)|Defense]] budget cuts caused people to encourage Fletcher to find a private sector job despite his ROTC training.  After graduating from college in 1987, he became a [[Trader (finance)|trader]] for Bear Stearns.<ref name="SMW" />  He was subsequently hired by Kidder Peabody where he emerged as an elite trader.  After his tenure at Kidder Peabody he founded Fletcher Asset Management.<ref name="UPNfF" /><ref name="PCFsim" />  Fletcher began his career as quantitative equity trader who capitalized on [[dividend]]-related arbitrage.<ref name="TBYGASP" />  At Bear Stearns he had worked in the [[Option (finance)|options]] department, but at Kidder he worked in the equity trading group.<ref name="TBYGASP" />  He also buys discounted equity stakes in companies, many of which are in restrictive liquidity positions which have caused the discounting of otherwise fundamentally sound investments.<ref name="TBYGASP" />

=== Alphonse Fletcher vs. Kidder Peabody ===
By age 25, Fletcher was Kidder's top equity trader, and he was earning $2 million a year.<ref name="DcmS" />  At the time, Kidder was owned by [[General Electric]] (GE).<ref name="DcmS" />  As part of his relationship with Kidder, the company agreed to pay him one quarter of the profits that he made for the firm, but when he earned the firm $25 million dollars, they only paid him half of the amount promised.  He sued for the other half ($3 million in back pay).<ref name="4U41AFJ" />  In addition to the pay dispute he filed a $5 million dollar (plus [[punitive damages]]) discrimination suit.<ref name="DcmS" />  Fletcher claimed the firm had kept their promise to white employees and claimed [[racial discrimination]] because white employees were paid more generously for similar work.<ref name="TOTGWW" /> Alleging a violation of State Human Rights Law, Fletcher filed a discrimination claim in the New York State Courts.<ref name=AFJAvKPCIR>{{cite web|url=http://www.law.cornell.edu/nyctap/I93_0157.htm#n1a|title=Alphonse Fletcher, Jr., Appellant, v. Kidder, Peabody & Company, Inc., Respondent. / Rita Reid, Appellant, V Goldman, Sachs & Co. Et Al., Respondent|accessdate=2008-09-15|date=1993-07-09|publisher=Cornell University Law School}}</ref>  The [[New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division]] ruled that an arbitration panel would hear his case.<ref name="TOTGWW">{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/113866|title=Taking On The Great White Way: Wall Street: Will Recent Discrimination Suits Open The Door For Women And Minority Executives?|accessdate=2008-09-12|date=1993-07-19|publisher=Newsweek, Inc.|work=[[Newsweek]]|author=Brant, Martha and Jolie Solomon}}</ref>

Jurisdiction in the case was a hotly contested matter.  In the Individual Assignment System (IAS) of the [[New York Supreme Court]], Fletcher sued Kidder under the New York State Human Rights Law, alleging racial discrimination in employment in violation of Executive Law <U+00A7> 296(1)(a). In response, Kidder moved to stay the judicial proceedings and compel arbitration on the basis of the broad arbitration clause that they had signed during securities exchange registration applications. Fletcher contended that the [[Federal Arbitration Act]] (FAA), which preempts state law, mandated enforcement of Kidder's promise to submit "controversies ... arising out of [his] employment" to arbitration.  The IAS court denied the motion, reasoning that "it would be against public policy to contract in advance for a waiver of the right to obtain judicial redress of alleged racial discrimination." The [[New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division]], however, "reversed and granted the requested relief after concluding that the FAA and the cases decided under that statute mandated enforcement of [Kidder's] arbitration agreement".<ref>{{cite court |litigants=Fletcher v.

=== Fletcher Asset Management ===
When Fletcher started Fletcher Asset Management (FAM), he was identified by ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' in 1994 as the top earning member of their thirty talented individuals under the age of thirty.<ref name="DcmS">{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1994/12/12/80043/index.htm|title=Don't call me SLACKER!

His general strategy was trading public instruments for his own account and on behalf of clients, but he also made longer-term equity investments. He used sophisticated [[hedge (finance)|hedges]] with both types of investments.<ref name="TBS" />  He has also been involved in [[PIPE deal]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE1DB1031F936A35755C0A9629C8B63|title= When Private Mixes With Public; A Financing Technique Grows More Popular and Also Raises Concerns|accessdate=2008-09-16|date=2004-06-05|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|work=[[The New York Times]]|author=Atlas, Riva D.}}</ref>  At various times he has been [[chauffeur]]ed to work in a [[Mercedes-Benz]],<ref name="TBS" /> a [[Bentley]],<ref name="DcmS" /> and a [[Jaguar Cars|Jaguar]].<ref name="TBYGASP" />

At first Fletcher hired 22 employees, but quickly found himself overstaffed.<ref name="TBYGASP" /> In 1994 he employed 11 workers.<ref name="TBYGASP" /> By 1996, his firm employed 25 people.<ref name="TBS" />  His firm's trading activity often accounts for 5% of the volume on the [[New York Stock Exchange]], and former boss and mentor [[Alan Greenberg]] describes him as a smart winner.<ref name="4U41AFJ" /> In 1994, Fletcher surrendered his [[broker-dealer]] registration and became a [[registered investment adviser]], which made managing money more convenient.<ref name="TBYGASP" />  Although his [[entrepreneur]]ial firm has thrived, he never dreamed of entrepreneurial enterprise and had hoped to be a GE executive someday.<ref name="DcmS" />

=== Public office ===
[[Alan G. Hevesi]] won the [[New York Comptroller election, 2006|2006 New York Comptroller election]] on November 7, 2006, but resigned from his four-year term the following month after pleading guilty to a [[felony]] for using a state worker as a driver and aide for his wife.  Fletcher was among a field of eighteen candidates who submitted [[r<U+00E9>sum<U+00E9>]]s to the [[New York State Legislature]] in January 2007.  Eventual selection [[Thomas DiNapoli]] was an immediate front runner for the position.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/20/nyregion--/20comptroller.html?|title=Candidates for State Comptroller Line Up|accessdate=2008-09-12|date=2007-01-20|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|work=[[The New York Times]]|author=Cooper, Michael}} {{dead link| date=June 2010 | bot=DASHBot}}</ref>  Fletcher had been convinced to enter his name by various public supporters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://empirezone.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/01/18/another-hat-in-the-ring/?|title=Another Hat in the Ring|accessdate=2008-09-16|date=2007-01-18|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|work=[[The New York Times]]|author=Confessore, Nicholas}}</ref> Other notable candidates were [[New York State Legislature]] members [[Richard Brodsky]], [[Joseph Morelle]], [[Felix Ortiz]], [[Pete Grannis]], and [[Martin Connor]]; and State and local officials [[Andrew SanFilippo]], [[Martha Stark]], and [[Andrew Eristoff]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://empirezone.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/01/19/the-candidates-for-comptroller/|title=The Candidates for Comptroller|accessdate=2008-09-16|date=2007-01-19|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|work=[[The New York Times]]|author=Hakim, Danny}}</ref>

== Philanthropy ==
In 1993, following the death of friend and advisor [[Reginald Lewis]], Fletcher donated $1 million to the Reginald F. Lewis Memorial Endowment. The endowment had been created by the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] after Lewis instructed his wife to bequeath $2 million to the organization.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=980CE7DE163BF935A1575AC0A965958260|title=Gifts Help N.A.A.C.P.

In 1996, to commemorate the 100th anniversary of ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'', {{ussc|163|537|1896}}, Fletcher endowed a University professorship at Harvard College with a $4.5 million dollar donation.  The Alphonse Fletcher, Jr. chair belongs to a special category of endowed positions established in 1935 as Harvard's highest professorial distinction.<ref name="5MGAtFLoBC" /><ref name="UPNfF" />  Unlike professors employed by a department or a school, University professors are free to teach courses in any discipline that they desire.  The chair was intended to be held, "whenever possible, by a faculty member from one of the professional schools who is devoted to teaching and research about contemporary moral, religious, and social values, and whose interests include undergraduate education."<ref name="UPNfF" />  Before leaving for [[Princeton University]], [[Cornel West]] held this chair.<ref name="5MGAtFLoBC" />  In 2006, [[Henry Louis Gates, Jr.]] became the Fletcher University Professor.<ref name="GnFUP">{{cite web|url=http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2006/10.26/99-gates.html|title=Gates named Fletcher University Professor|accessdate=2008-09-17|date=2006-10-23|work=Harvard University Gazette}}</ref>

In 2004, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of ''[[Brown v.

Anthony Appiah]], [[Amy Gutmann]], and [[Thelma Golden]].<ref name="5MGAtFLoBC" />

In 2006, Fletcher was part of a consortium of individuals who created a $50 million Professorship Challenge Fund at Harvard University.  The fund provides matching funds that encourages gifts to endow named professorships and provide faculty support across the University.<ref name="PCFsim">{{cite web|url=http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2006/02.16/01-profchallenge.html|title=Professorship Challenge Fund set into motion: Harvard donors aim to increase faculty resources across University

Fletcher has served his [[alma mater]] in many ways with his time in addition to his money.  He served on the Committee to Visit the College, and is a member of both the New York Major Gifts Committee and the Committee on University Resources. He once served as director of the Harvard Alumni Association and co-chaired his class of 1987 10th Reunion Gift Committee.
