The '''Paramount Theatre''' is located at 125 4th Avenue NE, [[Austin, Minnesota|Austin]] in the [[United States|U.S.]] state of [[Minnesota]]. The theater was built as an [[atmospheric theatre]] in 1929 to great fanfare, being the first [[movie palace]] in Austin accommodating 914 seats. The ceiling was painted with figures of dogs, winged creatures, and Spanish designs. It served the town until it closed in 1975, the genre being quashed by [[television]] and [[shopping mall|mall]] cinemas. In 1987 the Austin Area Commission for the Arts was formed to restore the building to its historic grandeur. Volunteers and donors, with the assistance of the [[Minnesota Historical Society]] repaired plaster and masonry and replaced the seats. A stone spire that had been hit by lightning in the 1940s was also repaired. This is one of only four such theaters in the state to be used as a theater; the building is currently used for performances by the Matchbox Children<U+2019>s Theatre, as well as assorted concerts and musical performances.<ref>{{cite web| title = History| publisher = Paramounttheatre.org| url = http://www.paramounttheatre.org/history.htm| accessdate =2008-01-30 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070829122234/http://www.paramounttheatre.org/history.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-08-29}}</ref><ref name="nord">{{cite book|title=The National Register of Historic Places in Minnesota|last=Nord|first=Mary Ann|publisher=[[Minnesota Historical Society]]|year=2003|isbn=0-87351-448-3}}</ref>
