{{Campaignbox Greco-Persian Wars}}

The '''Battle of Plataea''' was the final land battle during the [[second Persian invasion of Greece]].  It took place in 479 BC near the city of [[Plataea]] in [[Boeotia]], and was fought between an alliance of the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[city-state]]s, including [[Sparta]], [[History of Athens|Athens]], [[Corinth]], [[Megara]] and others, and the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians Empire]] of [[Xerxes I]].

The previous year, the Persian invasion force, led by the Persian king [[Xerxes I]], had scored victories at the Battles of [[Battle of Thermopylae|Thermopylae]] and [[Battle of Artemisium|Artemisium]], and conquered [[Thessaly]], Boeotia and [[Attica]]. However, at the ensuing [[Battle of Salamis]], the Allied Greek navy had won an unlikely victory, and therefore prevented the conquest of the [[Peloponnesus]]. Xerxes then retreated with much of his army, leaving his general [[Mardonius]] to finish off the Greeks the following year.

In the Summer of 479 BC, the Greeks assembled a huge army (by contemporaneous standards), and marched out of the Peloponnesus. The Persians retreated to Boeotia, and built a fortified camp near Plataea. The Greeks, however, refused to be drawn into the prime cavalry terrain around the Persian camp, resulting in a stalemate for 11 days. However, whilst attempting a retreat after their supply lines were disrupted, the Greek battle-line fragmented. Thinking the Greeks in full retreat, Mardonius ordered his forces to pursue them, but instead the Greeks (particularly the Spartans, Tegeans and Athenians) halted and gave battle, routing the lightly-armed Persian infantry and killing Mardonius.

A large portion of the Persian army was trapped in their camp, and slaughtered. The destruction of this army, and the remnants of the Persian navy, allegedly on the same day at the [[Battle of Mycale]], decisively ended the invasion. After Plataea and Mycale, the Allies would take the offensive against the Persians, marking a new phase of the [[Greco-Persian Wars]]. Although Plataea was in every sense a decisive victory, it does not seem to have been attributed the same significance (even at the time) as, for example the Athenian victory at the [[Battle of Marathon]] or even the Allied defeat at Thermopylae.

==Sources==
{{Main|Herodotus}}

The main primary source for the Greco-Persian Wars is the Greek historian [[Herodotus]]. Herodotus, who has been called the 'Father of History',<ref> Cicero, On the Laws I, 5 </ref> was born in 484 BC in Halicarnassus, Asia Minor (then under Persian overlordship). He wrote his "Enquiries" (Greek &ndash; ''Historia''; English &ndash; ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|(The) Histories]]'') in around 440-430 BC, trying to trace the origins of the Greco-Persian Wars, which would still have been relatively recent history (the wars finally ending in 449 BC).<ref name = hxvi/> Herodotus's approach was entirely novel, and at least in Western society, he does seem to have invented 'history' as we know it.<ref name = hxvi/> As Holland has it:<blockquote> ''"For the first time, a chronicler set himself to trace the origins of a conflict not to a past so remote so as to be utterly fabulous, nor to the whims and wishes of some god, nor to a people's claim to manifest destiny, but rather explanations he could verify personally."''<ref name = hxvi> Holland, pp xvi&ndash;xvii</ref> </blockquote> 

Many subsequent ancient historians, despite following in his footsteps, derided Herodotus, starting with [[Thucydides]].<ref> Thucydides, History of the Peloponnesian War I, 22 </ref> Nevertheless Thucydides chose to begin his history where Herodotus left off (at the [[Siege of Sestos]]), and must therefore have felt that Herodotus had done a reasonable job of summarising the preceeding history. [[Plutarch]] criticized Herodotus in his essay "On The Malignity of Herodotus", describing Herodotus as "Philobarbaros" (barbarian-lover), for not being pro-Greek enough. This actually suggests that Herodotus might have done a reasonable job of being even-handed.<ref> Holland, p xxiv </ref> A negative view of Herodotus was passed on Renaissance Europe, though he remained well read.<ref> David Pipes, [Herodotus: Father of History, Father of Lies] Online Essay. </ref> However, since the 19th century his reputation has been dramatically rehabilitated by archaelogical finds which have repeatedly confirmed his version of events.<ref name = h377> Holland, p377 </ref> The prevailing modern view is perhaps that Herodotus generally did a remarkable job in his "Historia", but that some of his specific details (particularly troop numbers and dates) should be viewed with skepticism.<ref name = h377/> However, there are still some historians who believe Herodotus made up much of story.<ref>Fehling, Detlev. ''Herodotus and His "Sources": Citation, Invention, and Narrative Art''. Translated by J.G. Howie. Arca Classical and Medieval Texts, Papers, and Monographs, 21. Leeds: Francis Cairns, 1989.</ref>

The Sicilian historian, [[Diodorus Siculus]], writing in the 1st century BC in his "[[Bibliotheca historica|Bibliotheca Historica]]", also provides an account of the Battle of Plataea. This account is fairly consistent with Herodotus's, but given that it was written much later, it may well have been derived from Herodotus's version.<ref> Diodorus Siculus, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0084&layout=&loc=11.28 Bibliotheca Historica], XI, 28-34 </ref> The Battle is also described in less detail by a number of other ancient historians including Plutarch, [[Ctesias of Cnidus]], and is alluded by other authors, such as the playwright [[Aeschylus]]. Archaeological evidence, such as the [[Serpent Column]] also supports some of Herodotus's specific claims.<ref> Note to Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&layout=&loc=9.81.1 IX, 81]</ref>

==Background==
{{Main|Greco-Persian Wars|First Persian invasion of Greece|Second Persian invasion of Greece}}

The Greek city-states of Athens and [[Eretria]] had supported the unsuccessful Ionian Revolt against the Persian Empire of [[Darius I]] in 499-494 BC. Darius demanded revenge on these two city-states,<ref>Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&layout=&loc=5.105 V, 105]</ref> and also saw the opportunity to expand his empire into the fractious world of Ancient Greece.<ref name = "h171"> Holland, 171&ndash;178 </ref> A preliminary expedition under Mardonius, in 492 BC, to secure the land approaches to Greece ended with the re-conquest of [[Thrace]] and forced [[Macedon]] to become a client kingdom of Persia.<ref>Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;layout=;query=chapter%3D%23946;loc=6.43.1 VI, 44]</ref> An amphibious task force was then sent out under [[Datis]] and [[Artaphernes (son of Artaphernes)|Artaphernes]] in 490 BC, successfully attacking [[Naxos]] and [[Eretria]],<ref> Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231007;layout=;loc=6.100.1 VI, 101] </ref> before moving to attack Athens. However, at the ensuing [[Battle of Marathon]], the Athenians won a remarkable victory, which resulted in the withdrawal of the Persian army to Asia.<ref> Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&layout=&loc=6.113 VI, 113] </ref>

[[Image:Map Greco-Persian Wars-en.svg|thumb|left|300px|A map showing the Greek world at the time of the battle]]

Darius therefore began raising a huge new army with which he meant to completely subjugate Greece. However, he died before the invasion could begin.<ref> Holland, pp206&ndash;208 </ref> The throne of Persia passed to his son Xerxes I who quickly re-started the preparations for the invasion of Greece, including building two pontoon bridges across the [[Hellespont]].<ref name = h208> Holland, pp208&ndash;211 </ref> In 481 BC, Xerxes sent ambassadors around Greece asking for earth and water, but making the very deliberate omission of Athens and Sparta (both of whom were at open war with Persia).<ref>Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&layout=&loc=7.32.1 VII, 32 VII, 31]</ref> Support thus began to coalesce around these two leading states. A congress of city states met at [[Corinth]] in late autumn of 481 BC,<ref name="VII145"> Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&layout=&loc=7.145.1 VII, 145] </ref> and a confederate alliance of [[History of Greece|Greek city-states]] was formed. This was remarkable for the disjointed Greek world, especially since many of the city-states in attendance were still technically at war with each other.<ref name = "h226"> Holland, p226 </ref>

The 'Allies' initially adopted a strategy of blocking the land and sea approaches to southern Greece.<ref name = "h255"> Holland, pp255-257 </ref> Thus, in August 480 BC, after hearing of Xerxes's approach, a small Allied army led by the Spartan king [[Leonidas I]] blocked the Pass of [[Thermopylae]], whilst an Athenian-dominated navy sailed to the Straits of [[Artemisium]]. Famously, the massively outnumbered Greek army held Thermopylae against the Persians army for six days in total, before being outflanked by a mountain path. Although much of the Greek army retreated, the rearguard of Spartans and Thespians were surrounded and killed.<ref name = h292> Holland, pp292&ndash;294 </ref> The simultaneous Battle of Artemisium was up to that point a stalemate;<ref> Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231321;layout=;loc=8.19.1 VIII, 18] </ref> however, when news of Thermopylae reached them, they also retreated, since holding the straits of Artemisium was now a moot point.<ref> Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231324;layout=;loc=8.20.1 VIII, 21] </ref>

Following Thermopylae, the Persian army had proceeded to burn and sack the Boeotian cities which had not surrendered, Plataea and [[Thespiae]]; before taking possession of the now-evacuated city of Athens. The Allied army, meanwhile, prepared to defend the [[Isthmus of Corinth]].<ref> Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231380;layout=;loc=8.72.1 VIII, 71] </ref> Xerxes wished for a final crushing defeat of the Allies to finish the conquest of Greece in that campaigning season; conversely the Allies sought a decisive victory over the Persian navy that would guarantee the security of the Peloponnessus.<ref name = h303> Holland, p303 </ref> The ensuing naval Battle of Salamis ended in a decisive victory for the Greeks, marking (in retrospect) a turning point in the conflict.<ref name = h333> Holland, p333&ndash;335 </ref>

[[Image:Battle of Thermopylae and movements to Salamis, 480 BC.gif|right|thumb|300px|Movements to Salamis]]

Following the defeat of his navy at the Salamis, Xerxes retreated to Asia with the bulk of the army. According to Herodotus, this was because he feared the Greeks would sail to the Hellespont and destroy the pontoon bridges, thereby trapping his army in Europe.<ref> Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231406;layout=;loc=8.98.1 VIII, 97]</ref> He thus left Mardonius, with handpicked troops, to complete the conquest of Greece the following year.<ref> Holland, pp327&ndash;329 </ref> Mardonius evacuated Attica, and over-wintered in Thessaly;<ref> Holland, p330 </ref> with the Athenians then reoccupying their destroyed city.<ref name = h333/> Over the winter, there seems to have been some tension between the Allies. In particular, the Athenians, who were not protected by the Isthmus, but whose fleet were the key to the security of the Peloponnesus, felt hard done by, and demanded an Allied army march north the following year.<ref name = h333/> When the Allies failed to commit to this, the Athenian fleet refused to join the Allied navy in Spring. The navy, now under the command of the Spartan king [[Leotychides]], thus skulked off [[Delos]], whilst the remnants of the Persian fleet skulked off [[Samos]], both sides unwilling to risk battle.<ref name = h336/> Similarly, Mardonius remained in Thessaly, knowing an attack on the Isthmus was pointless, whilst the Allies refused to send an army outside the Peloponessus.<ref name = h333/>

Mardonius moved to break the stalemate, by offering peace, self-government and territorial expansion to the Athenians (with the aim of removing their fleet from the Allied forces), using [[Alexander I of Macedon]]) as intermediate.<ref name = h336> Holland, pp336&ndash;338 </ref> The Athenians made sure that a Spartan delegation was on hand to hear the offer, but rejected it: <blockquote> ''The degree to which we are put in the shadow by the Medes' strength is hardly something you need to bring to our attention. We are already well aware of it. But even so, such is our love of liberty, that we will never surrender.''<ref name = h336/></blockquote> Athens was thus evacuated again, and the Persians marched south and re-took possession of it. Mardonius now repeated his offer of peace to the Athenian refugees on Salamis. Athens, along with [[Megara]] and Plataea sent emissaries to Sparta demanding assistance, and threatening to accept the Persian terms if not.<ref> Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231461;layout=;loc=9.7A%201 IX, 7]</ref>  According to Herodotus, the Spartans, who were at that time celebrating the festival of [[Hyacinthus]], delayed making a decision until they were persuaded by a guest, Chileos of [[Tegea]], who pointed out the danger to all of Greece if the Athenians surrendered.<ref> Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231465;layout=;loc=9.10.1 IX, 6-9]</ref> When, the next day the Athenian emissaries delivered an ultimatum to the Spartans, they were amazed to hear that a task force was in fact already ''en route''; the Spartan army was marching to meet the Persians.<ref> Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231467;layout=;loc=9.10.1 IX, 10]</ref>

==Prelude==

When Mardonius learned of the Spartan force, he completed the destruction of Athens, tearing down whatever was standing.<ref name = IX13>Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231469;layout=;loc=9.12.1 IX, 13]</ref> He then retreated towards [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]], hoping to lure the Greek army into territory which would be suitable for the Persian cavalry.<ref name = IX13/> Mardonius created a fortified encampment on the north bank of the [[Asopus]] river in Boeotia, and waited for the Greeks.<ref> Herodotus  [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231471;layout=;loc=9.14.1 IX, 15] </ref>

The Athenians sent 8,000 hoplites, led by [[Aristides]], along with 600 Plataean exiles, to join the Allied army.<ref name = IX28/> The army then marched in Boeotia across the passes of [[Mount Cithaeron]], arriving near [[Plataea]], and above the Persian position on the Asopus.<ref name = h343/> Under the guidance of the commanding general, [[Pausanias (general)|Pausanias]], the Greeks took up position opposite the Persian lines, but remained on high ground.<ref name = h343> Holland, pp343&ndash;349 </ref> Knowing that he had little hope of successfully attacking the Greek positions, Mardonius sought to either sow dissension amongst the Allies, or lure them down into the plain.<ref name = h343/> Plutarch reports that a conspiracy was discovered amongst some prominent Athenians, who were planning to betray the Allied cause; although this account is not universally accepted, it may indicate Mardonius's attempts to intrigue with the Greeks.<ref name = h343/> 

[[File:Battle of Plataea part 1.png|thumb|300px|left|The initial movements at the Battle of Plataea. The Greek line moves forward to the Asopus ridge.]]

Mardonius also sent hit-and-run cavalry attacks against the Greek lines, possibly trying to lure the Greeks down to the plain in pursuit.<ref name = h343/><ref><U+0399><U+03C3><U+03C4><U+03BF><U+03C1><U+03AF><U+03B1> <U+03C4><U+03BF><U+03C5> <U+0395><U+03BB><U+03BB><U+03B7><U+03BD><U+03B9><U+03BA><U+03BF><U+03CD> <U+0388><U+03B8><U+03BD><U+03BF><U+03C5><U+03C2> (History of the Greek nation) vol. <U+0392>', Ekdotiki Athinon, Athens, 1971</ref> Although initially having some success,<ref name = IX22> Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bi/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231478;layout=;loc=9.21.1 IX, 22]</ref> this strategy backfired when the cavalry commander [[Masistius]] was killed, whereupon the cavalry retreated.<ref name = IX22/><ref name = IX23> Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231479;layout=;loc=9.22.1 IX, 23]</ref> 

Their morale boosted by this small victory, the Greeks moved forward, still remaining on higher ground, to a new position nearer Mardonius's camp.<ref name = XI25> Herodotus, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231481;layout=;loc=9.24.1 IX, 25] </ref>. The Spartans and Tegeans were on a ridge to the right of the line, the Athenians on a hillock on the left, and the other contingents on the slightly lower ground between.<ref name = h343/> In response Mardonius brought his men up to the Asopus, and arrayed them for battle. However, both sides refused to attack; Herodotus claims this is because both sides received bad omens during sacrificial rituals.<ref> Herodotus, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231489;layout=;loc=9.32.1 IX, 33] </ref> The armies thus stayed camped in their present locations for 8 days, and all the while new Greek troops arrived.<ref name = IX39> Herodotus, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&layout=&loc=9.39.1 IX, 39] </ref> Mardonius then sought to break the stalemate by sending his cavalry to attack the passes of Mount Cithaeron; this raid resulted in the capture a convoy of provisions intended for the Greeks.<ref name = IX39/> Two further days passed, during which time the supply lines of the Greeks continued to be menaced.<ref name = h343/> Mardonius then launched a further cavalry raid on the Greek lines, which succeeded in blocking the Gargaphian Spring, which had been the only source of water for the Greek army (they could not use the Asopus due to the threat posed by the Persian archers).<ref name = IX49> Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231505;layout=;loc=9.48.1 IX, 49] </ref> Coupled with the lack of food, the restriction of the water supply made the Greek position untenable, so they decided to retreat to a position in front of Plataea, from where they could guard the passes and have access to fresh water.<ref name = IX51> Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231507;layout=;loc=9.52.1 IX 51] </ref> To prevent the Persian cavalry attacking the retreat, it was to be performed that night.<ref name = IX51/>

However, the retreat went badly awry. The Allied contingents in the centre missed their appointed position, and ended up scattered in front of Plataea itself.<ref name = h343/> The Athenians, Tegeans and Spartans, who had been guarding the rear of the retreat, had not even begun to retreat by daybreak.<ref name = h343/> A single Spartan division was thus left on the ridge to guard the rear, whilst the Spartans and Tegeans retreated uphill; Pausanias also instructed the Athenians to begin the retreat and if possible to join up with the Spartans.<ref name = h343/><ref name = IX55> Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231511;layout=;loc=9.54.1 IX, 55]</ref>. However, the Athenians at first retreated directly towards Plataea,<ref name = IX55> Herodotus[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231511;layout=;loc=9.54.1 IX, 55]</ref> and thus the Allied battle line remained fragmented as the Persian camp began to stir.<ref name = h343/>

==The opposing forces==
===The Greeks===
According to Herodotus, the Spartans sent 45,000 men;  5,000 [[Spartiate]]s (full citizen soldiers), 5,000 other [[Lacedaemonia]]n hoplites ([[perioeci]]) and 35,000 [[helots]] (seven per Spartiate).<ref name = IX28/>  This was probably the largest Spartan force ever assembled.<ref name = h343/> The Greek army had been reinforced by contingents of hoplites from the other Allied city-states, as shown in the table.

According to Herodotus, there were a total of 69,500 lightly armed troops; 35,000 helots,<ref name = IX29/> and 34,500 troops from the rest of Greece; roughly one per hoplite.<ref name = IX29/> Herodotus also tells us that there were also 1,800 Thespians (but not how they were equipped), giving a total strength of 110,000 men.<ref>Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&layout=&loc=9.30 9.30 IX, 30]</ref>

The number of hoplites is accepted as reasonable (and possible); the Athenians alone had fielded 10,000 hoplites at the Battle of Marathon.<ref name = h343/> Some historians have accepted the number of light troops and used them as a [[population census]] of Greece at the time. Certainly these numbers are theoretically possible. Athens, for instance, allegedly fielded a fleet of 180 triremes at Salamis,<ref name = VIII44> Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231347;layout=;loc=8.43.1 VIII, 44]</ref> manned by approximately 36,000 rowers.<ref> Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&layout=&loc=7.184 VII, 184] </ref> Thus 69,500 light troops could easily have been sent to Plataea. Nevertheless, the number of light troops is often rejected as exaggerated, expecially in view of the ratio of 7 helots to 1 Spartiate.<ref name = h343/> For instance, Lazenby accepts that hoplites from other Greek cities might have been accompanied by 1 lightly armoured retainer each, but rejects the number of 7 helots per Spartiate.<ref name = Laz227> Lazenby, pp227&ndash;228 </ref> He further speculates that each Spartiate was accompanied by 1 armed helot, and the remaining helots were employed in the logistical effort, transporting food for the army.<ref name = Laz227/> Both Lazenby and Holland deem the lightly armed troops, whatever their number, as essentially irrelevant to the outcome of battle.<ref name = Laz227/><ref name = h400> Holland, p400 </ref>

A further complication is that a certain proportion of Allied manpower was needed to man the fleet, which amounted to at least 110 triremes, and thus approximately 22,000 men.<ref> Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&layout=&loc=8.132 VIII, 132] </ref> Since the Battle of Mycale was fought at least near-simultaneously with the Battle of Plataea, then this was a pool of manpower which could not have contributed to Plataea, and further reduces the likelihood that 110,000 Greeks assembled before Plataea.<ref> Holland, p357 </ref>

The Greek forces were, as agreed by the Allied congress, under the overall command of Spartan Royalty in the person of [[Pausanias (general)|Pausanias]]. Pausanias was the regent for Leonidas's young son, [[Pleistarchus]], his cousin. Diodorus tells us that the Athenian contingent was under the command of Artistides;<ref> Diodorus Siculus, Bibliotheca Historica [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0084;layout=;query=chapter%3D%23105;loc=11.28.1 XI, 29]</ref> it is probable that the other contigents also had their leader. Herodotus tells us in several places that the Greeks held council during the prelude to the battle, implying that decisions were consensual, and that Pausanias did not have the authority to issue direct orders to the other contingents.<ref name = XI25/><ref name = IX51/> This style of leadership contributed to the way events unfolded during the battle itself. For instance, in the period immediately before the battle, Pausanias was unable to order the Athenians to join up with his forces, and thus the Greeks fought the battle completely separated from each other.<ref name = IX60/>

===The Persians===
According to Herodotus, the Persians numbered 300,000 and were accompanied by troops from Greek city states which supported the Persian cause (including Thebes).<ref name = IX32/> Herodotus admits that no-one counted the latter, so he guesses that there were 50,000 of them.<ref name = IX32> Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231488;layout=;loc=9.31.1 IX, 32] </ref>

[[Ctesias]], who wrote a history of Persia based on Persian archives, claimed there were 120,000 Persian and 7,000 Greek soldiers, but his account is generally garbled (for instance, placing this battle before Salamis).<ref name = ctes> Ctesias, [http://www.livius.org/ct-cz/ctesias/photius_persica2.html Persica] (from Photius's Epitome)</ref> Nevertheless, his figure is remarkably close to that generated by modern consensus.<ref name = ctes/>

The figure of 300,000 has been doubted, along with many of Herodotus's numbers, by many historians; modern consensus estimates the total [[Second Persian invasion of Greece#Size of the Persian Forces|number of troops]] for the Persian invasion at around 250,000.<ref> Holland, p237 </ref> According to this consensus, Herodotus's 300,000 Persians at Plataea would self-evidently be impossible. One approach to estimating the size of the Persian army has been to estimate how many men might feasibly have been accommodated within the Persian camp; this approach gives figures of between 70,000 and 120,000 men.<ref name = h400/> Lazenby, for instance, by comparison with later [[Roman]] military camps calculates a number of 70,000 troops, including 10,000 cavalry.<ref name = Laz227/> Meanwhile, Connolly derives a number of 120,000 from the same sized camp.<ref name = Con> Peter Connolly (1981), Greece and Rome at War </ref> Indeed, most estimates for the total Persian force are generally in this range.<ref> [http://www.militaryhistoryonline.com/ancient/plataea/default.aspx Military History Online website] </ref><ref> Green (1996), The Greco-Persian Wars </ref><ref name = Del/> For instance, Delbr<U+00FC>ck, based on the distance the Persians marched in a day when Athens was attacked, concluded that 75,000 was the upper limit for the size of the army.<ref name = Del> Delbr<U+00FC>ck, p35</ref>

<!--Munro and Macan  note that Herodotus mentions by name six superior military commanders and 29 <U+03BC><U+03C5><U+03C1><U+03AF><U+03B1><U+03C1><U+03C7><U+03BF><U+03B9> (''myriarchoi''), commanders of a ''[[Persian Immortals|baivarabam]]''.<ref>Cambridge Ancient History vol IV 1929</ref> The ''baivarabam'' was the tactical unit of the ancient Persian infantry that numbered 10,000 men; thus, if these units were all at full strength, a force approximating 300,000 might have been possible.<ref> Papademetriou Konstantinos </ref>{{fact}} page number for such an extraordinary claim-->

==Strategic and tactical considerations==
In some ways, the run-up to Plataea resembled that at the Battle of Marathon; there was a prolonged stalemate in which neither side risked attacking the other.<ref name = h343/> The reasons for this stalemate were primarily tactical, and similar to the situation at Marathon; the Greek hoplites did not want to risk being outflanked by the Persian cavalry, and the lightly armed Persian infantry could not hope to assault well defended positions.<ref name = h343/>

From a strategic point of view, both sides wished for a decisive battle which would tip the war in their favour.<ref name = IX41> Herodotus, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231497;layout=;loc=9.40.1 IX, 41]</ref><ref name = h343/> Equally, however, the strategic situation allowed both sides to procrastinate, since food supplies were in ample supply for both armies<ref name = IX41/><ref name = h343/>. Under these conditions, the tactical considerations outweighed the strategic need for action.

However, when Mardonius's raids disrupted the Greek supply chain, it forced a strategic rethink on the part of the Greeks. Rather than now moving to attack, however, they instead looked to retreat slightly and secure their lines of communication.<ref name = IX51/> Despite this defensive move from the Greeks, it was in fact the chaos resulting from this retreat which finally ended the stalemate. Mardonius perceived this as a full-on retreat, in effect thinking that the battle was already over, and sought to pursue the Greeks.<ref name = IX58> Herodotus, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231514;layout=;loc=9.57.1 IX, 58]</ref> Since he did not expect the Greeks to fight, the tactical problems were no longer an issue, and he tried to take advantage of the altered strategic situation he thought he had produced.<ref name = h343/> Conversely, the Greeks had, inadvertently, lured Mardonius into attacking them on the higher ground, and despite being outnumbered, and were thus at a tactical advantage.<ref name = h343/>

==The Battle==
Once the Persians discovered that the Greeks had abandoned their positions, and appeared to be in retreat, Mardonius decided to set off in immediate pursuit with the elite Persian infantry.<ref name = IX59> Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231515;layout=;loc=9.58.1 IX, 59] </ref> As he did so, the rest of the Persian army, unbidden, also began to move forward.<ref name = IX59/> The Spartans and Tegeans had by now reached the Temple of Demeter.<ref name = h350/> The rearguard under [[Amompharetus]] began to withdraw from the ridge, under pressure from Persian cavalry, to join them.<ref name = h350> Holland, p350&ndash;355 </ref> Pausanias sent a messenger to the Athenians, asking them to join up with the Spartans.<ref name = IX60> Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231516;layout=;loc=9.61.1 IX, 60] </ref> However, the Athenians had been engaged by the Theban phalanx, and unable to assist Pausanias.<ref name = h350/> The Spartans and Tegeans were first assaulted by the Persian cavalry,<ref name = IX60/> whilst the Persian infantry made their way forward. The Persian infantry then planted their shields and began firing arrows at the Greeks, whilst the cavalry withdrew.<ref name = IX60/><ref name = h350/>

[[File:Battle of Plataea part 2.PNG|thumb|300px|right|The main battle at Plataea. The Greek retreat becomes disorganised, and the Persians cross the Asopus to attack]]

According to Herodotus, Pausanias refused to advance, because good omens were not divined in the goat-sacrifices that were performed.<ref name = IX61> Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231517;layout=;loc=9.60.1 IX, 61] </ref> At this point, as men began to fall under the barrage of arrows, the Tegeans started to run at the Persian lines.<ref name = IX61/> Offering one last sacrifice and a prayer to the heavens, Pausanias finally received favourable omens, and gave the command for the Spartans to advance, whereupon they too charged the Persian lines.<ref name = IX62> Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231518;layout=;loc=9.63.1 IX, 62] </ref>

The numerically superior Persian infantry were of the heavy (by Persian standards) [[sparabara]] formation, but this was still much lighter than the Greek [[Phalanx formation|phalanx]].<ref name = IX63/> The Persian defensive weapon was a large wicker shield, and they used short spears; by contrast the hoplites were armoured in bronze, with a bronze shield and a long spear.<ref name = h350/> As at Marathon, it was a severe mismatch.<ref name = IX62/><ref name = IX65/> The fight was fierce and long, but the Greeks continued to push into the Persian lines.<ref name = h350/> The Persians tried to break the Greeks' spears by grabbing hold of them, but the Greeks were able to use their swords instead.<ref name = IX62/> Mardonius was present at the scene, riding a white horse, and surrounded by a bodyguard of 1,000 men, and whilst he remained, the Persians stood their ground.<ref name = IX63> Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231519;layout=;loc=9.62.1 IX, 63] </ref> However, the Spartans closed in on Mardonius, and a stone thrown by the Spartan Aeimnestus hit him in the head, killing him.<ref name = IX64> Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231520;layout=;loc=9.63.1 IX, 64] </ref> With Mardonius dead, the Persians began to flee, although his bodyguard remained and were annihilated.<ref name = h350/> Quickly the rout became general, with many Persians fleeing in disorder to their camp. <ref name = IX65> Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231521;layout=;loc=9.64.1 IX, 65] </ref> However, [[Artabazus]] (who had earlier commanded the [[Second Persian invasion of Greece#Siege of Potidea|Sieges]] of [[Olynthus]] and [[Potidea]]), had disagreed with Mardonius about attacking the Greeks,<ref name = IX58> Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231514;layout=;loc=9.57.1 IX, 58] </ref> and he had not fully engaged the forces under his command.<ref name = IX66> Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231522;layout=;loc=9.65.1 IX, 66] </ref> As the rout commenced, he led these men (40,000 according to Herodotus) away from the battle field, on the road to Thessaly, hoping to escape eventually to the Hellespont.<ref name = IX66/>

===Accounts of individuals===
Herodotus recounts several anecdotes about the conduct of specific Spartans during the battle.
* '''[[Amompharetus]]''' - The leader of a battalion of Spartans, he refused to undertake the night-time retreat towards Plataea before the battle, since doing so would be shameful for a Spartan.<ref> Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231509;layout=;loc=9.54.1 IX 53] </ref> Herodotus has a angry debate continuing between Pausanias and Amompharetus until dawn, whereupon the rest of the Spartan army finally began to retreat, leaving Amompharetus's division behind. <ref> Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231512;layout=;loc=9.55.1 IX, 56] </ref> Not expecting this, Amompharetus eventually led his men after the retreating Spartans.<ref> Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231513;layout=;loc=9.56.1 IX 97] </ref> However, another tradition remembers Amompharetus as winning great renown at Plataea, and it has thus been suggested that Amompharetus, far from being insubordinate, had instead volunteered to guard the rear.<ref name = h350/>
* '''[[Aristodemus (Spartan)|Aristodemus]]''' - the lone Spartan survivor of the slaughter of the 300 at the [[Battle of Thermopylae]], he had, with a fellow Spartiate, been dismissed from the army by [[Leonidas I]] because of an eye infection. However, his colleague had insisted on being led into battle, partially blind, by a helot.<ref> Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231293;layout=;loc=7.230.1 VII, 229] </ref> Preferring to return to Sparta, Aristodemus was branded a coward, and suffered a year of reproach before Plataea.<ref name = h350/> Anxious to redeem his name, he charged the Persian lines by himself, killing in a savage fury before being killed.<ref> Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231527;layout=;loc=9.72.1 IX, 71] </ref> Although the Spartans agreed that he had redeemed himself, they awarded him no special honour, because he failed to fight in the disciplined manner expected of a Spartan.<ref name = h350/>
* '''Callicrates''' - Considered the "most beautiful man, not among the Spartans only, but in the whole Greek camp" Callicrates was eager to distinguish himself that day as a warrior but was deprived of the chance by a stray arrow that pierced his side while standing in formation. When the battle commenced he insisted on making the charge with the rest but collapsed within a short distance. His last words, according to Herodotus, were "I grieve not because I have to die for my country, but because I have not lifted my arm against the enemy."<ref name = IX72> Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&layout=&loc=9.72 IX, 72]</ref>

==Aftermath==
{{Main|Battle of Mycale|Second Persian invasion of Greece}}
[[File:Greek-Persian duel.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Greek hoplite and Persian warrior, fighting each other. Ancient kylix. 5th c. B.C..]]

According to Herodotus, the Battle of Mycale occurred on the same afternoon as Plataea.
A Greek fleet under the Spartan king Leotychides had sailed to Samos to challenge the remnants of the Persian fleet.<ref name = IX96> Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231552;layout=;loc=9.95.1 IX, 96] </ref> The Persians, whose ships were in a poor state of repair, had decided not to risk fighting, and instead drew their ships up on the beach at the feet of [[Mycale|Mount Mycale]] in [[Ionia]]. An army of 60,000 men had been left there by Xerxes, and the fleet joined with them, building a pallisade around the camp to protect the ships.<ref name = IX96/> However, Leotychides decided to attack the camp with the Allied fleet's marines.<ref name = h357> Holland, pp35&ndash;358 </ref> Seeing the small size of the Greek force, the Persians emerged from the camp, but the Greek hoplites again proved superior, and destroyed much of the Persian force.<ref name = h357/> The ships were abandoned to the Greeks, who burnt them, crippling Xerxes' sea power, and marking the ascendancy of the Greek fleet.<ref name = h357/> 

With the twin victories of Plataea and Mycale, the second Persian invasion of Greece was over. Moreover, the threat of future invasion was abated; although the Greeks remained worried that Xerxes would try again, over time it became apparent that the Persian desire to conquer Greece was much diminished. <ref name="h358"/> 

The remnants of the Persian army, under the command of Artabazus, tried to retreat back to [[Asia Minor]]. Travelling through the lands of Thessaly, Macedon and Thrace by the shortest road, Artabazus eventually made it back to [[Byzantium]], though losing many men to Thracian attacks, weariness and hunger.<ref name = IX89> Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231545;layout=;loc=9.90.1 IX, 89] </ref> After the victory at Mycale, the Allied fleet sailed to the Hellespont to break down the pontoon bridges, but found that this was already done.<ref name = IX114> Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231570;layout=;loc=9.115.1 IX, 114] </ref> The Peloponnesians sailed home, but the Athenians remained to attack the [[Thracian Chersonese|Chersonesos]], still held by the Persians.<ref name = IX114/> The Persians in the region, and their allies, made for [[Sestos]], the strongest town in the region, and the Athenians laid siege to them there. After a protracted siege, Sestos fell to the Athenians, marking the beginning of a new phase in the Greco-Persian Wars, the [[Greco-Persian Wars#The Greek Counterattack|Greek counterattack]].<ref name = h359> Holland, pp359&ndash;363 </ref> Herodotus ended his ''Histories'' after the [[Greco-Persian Wars#Seige of Sestos|Siege of Sestos]]. Over the next 30 years, the Greeks, primarily the Athenian-dominated [[Delian League]], would expel (or help expel) the Persians from Macedon, Thrace, the Aegean islands and Ionia.<ref name = h359/> Peace with Persia finally came in 449 BC with the [[Greco-Persian Wars#The Peace of Callias|Peace of Callias]], finally ending the half-century of warfare.<ref name = h359/>

==Significance==
Plataea and Mycale have great significance in Ancient history as the battles which decisively ended the second Persian invasion of Greece, thereby swinging the balance of the Greco-Persian Wars in favour of the Greeks.<ref name = h359/> The Battle of Salamis saved Greece from immediate conquest, but it was Plataea and Mycale which effectively ended that threat.<ref name = h359/> However, neither of these battles is nearly as well-known as [[Battle of Thermopylae|Thermopylae]], [[Battle of Salamis|Salamis]] or [[Battle of Marathon|Marathon]].<ref> For instance, based on the number of [http://www.google.com Google] hits, or the number of books  written specifically about those battles </ref> The reason for this discrepancy is not entirely clear; it might however be a result of the circumstances in which the battle was fought. The fame of Thermopylae certainly lies in the doomed heroism of the Greeks, in the face of overwhelming numbers;<ref name = hxvi> Holland, pp xvi&ndash;xxii </ref> and Marathon and Salamis perhaps because they were both fought against the odds, and in dire strategic situations. Conversely, the Battles of Plataea and Mycale were both fought from a relative position of Greek strength, and against lesser odds; the Greeks in fact sought out battle on both occasions.<ref name = h336/><ref name = h359/>

Militarily, the major lesson of both Plataea and Mycale (since both were fought on land) was to re-emphasise the superiority of the [[hoplite]] over the more-lightly armed Persian infantry, as had first been demonstrated at Marathon.<ref name = h358> Holland, p358&ndash;359 </ref> Taking on this lesson, after the Greco-Persian Wars the Persian empire started recruiting and relying on Greek mercenaries.<ref> Xenophon, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0202;query=chapter%3D%231;layout=;loc=1.2.1 Anabasis] </ref>
