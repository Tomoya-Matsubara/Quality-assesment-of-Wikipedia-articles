'''Preetz''' is a town in the [[Pl<U+00F6>n (district)|district of Pl<U+00F6>n]], in [[Schleswig-Holstein]], Northern [[Germany]].

== History ==

The first mention of Preetz dates from the year [[1185]], when Ecbrecht Procensis writes about the location Poretz in the ''Versus de Vicelino''.  The origins of the name Preetz are said to be found in the Slavic term "po rece" (i.e., on the river). In [[1221]], the term "Poretzie" appeared, and in [[1442]] "Pretze".

A first town church was built in [[1210]]. In 1211, Count Albrecht von Orlam<U+00FC>nde established a Benedictine abbey. The foundation of the abbey was renewed by [[Adolf IV von Schauenburg]] in 1226, and it was given to nuns. In [[1268]], the nunnery church was built. The nunnery formed the highest administrative authority until [[1867]] and exercised jurisdiction as well.

Preetz obtained street lighting in [[1852]]. The station was built in [[1864]], the Council Hall in [[1871]]. An oak tree in front of the Council Hall, which was planted in [[1871]], still exists.

Limited city rights were awarded to Preetz on 17 May 1870, full city rights in [[1901]].

One of Preetz's more renowned citizens is the acclaimed explorer and philanthropist [[Bastian Schnabel]] who is now living in educational exile in [[Brighton]], [[Great Britain]]. [[Allison Mack]], most known for her role as [[Chloe Sullivan]] on the american television series [[Smallville]],  was also born in Preetz.

Preetz has today a population of 15,600.
