'''''Halo Wars''''' is a [[real-time strategy]] (RTS) video game developed by [[Ensemble Studios]] and published by [[Microsoft Game Studios]] for the [[Xbox 360]] [[video game console]]. It was released in Japan and Australia on February&nbsp;26, 2009, in [[PAL region|PAL]] territories on February&nbsp;27, and in North America on March&nbsp;3. The game is set in the science fiction universe of the [[Halo (series)|''Halo'' series]] in the year 2531, 20&nbsp;years before the events of ''[[Halo: Combat Evolved]]''. The player leads human soldiers aboard the warship ''Spirit of Fire'' in an effort to stop an ancient fleet of ships from falling into the hands of the genocidal alien [[Covenant (Halo)|Covenant]].

''Halo Wars'' was officially unveiled at the [[X06 (Xbox show)|X06]] Xbox show in 2006. Ensemble designed the game specifically for the Xbox 360 controller, in an attempt to circumvent issues present in previous console RTS. Ensemble was closed by Microsoft before the game's release, but [[Robot Entertainment]] was quickly founded by many of Ensemble's former employees; this new company continued to support ''Halo Wars'' with updates and [[downloadable content]].

''Halo Wars'' received generally positive reviews. Reviewers lauded the game's pre-rendered cinematics, attention to detail in replicating the ''Halo'' universe, and intuitive control scheme. Complaints against the game included the lack of an option to play as the Covenant faction in campaign mode, or to play as [[Flood (Halo)|the Flood]] in any mode, as well as the lack of strategic options during play. Critics from [[GameSpot]] and ''[[USA Today]]'' wrote that experienced RTS players would find the strategic elements of the title shallow. The game sold one million units worldwide through March 2009, making it the best-selling console real-time strategy game to date.

''Halo Wars'' is a [[real-time strategy]] (RTS) video game developed exclusively for the [[Xbox 360]] console, in which players command armies from a [[bird's-eye view]] of the battlefield. The game focuses on military combat, but contains streamlined resource management and base construction elements.<ref name="nzh-interview"/> It was designed with the [[Xbox 360 Controller]] in mind; for example, the A button is used for selecting units. A single tap of the button selects one unit, while a double tap selects all units of the same type.<ref name="1up-review"/> The Left D-pad navigates to current battles and cycles through bases, while the right [[analog stick]] adjusts the camera angle. A radial [[Menu (computing)|menu]] is used for base construction.<ref>{{cite web|author=Robinson, Andy|date=2007-07-21|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=168577|title=Interview: Ensemble talks up the console RTS|work=[[Computer and Video Games]]|accessdate=2009-04-01|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090418000126/http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=168577|archivedate=2009-04-18}}</ref>

''Halo Wars'' features a story-based, military campaign [[Game mechanic#Game modes|game mode]] that can be played alone or [[Cooperative gameplay|cooperatively]] over the [[Xbox Live]] service. A plotless [[multiplayer]] option, called "skirmish mode", lets players compete against human or computer-controlled opponents.<ref>{{cite web|author=Staff|date=2009-02-20|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/News/Story/200902/N09.0220.1229.43623.htm|title=Halo Wars: Campaign and Skirmish Mode Impressions|publisher=[[Game Informer]]|accessdate=2009-06-03|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090430201357/http://www.gameinformer.com/News/Story/200902/N09.0220.1229.43623.htm|archivedate=2009-04-30}}</ref> The game features two factions the players can control: the human [[United Nations Space Command]] (UNSC) and alien [[Covenant (Halo)|Covenant]]. Each faction has different units, strengths, and special abilities. There are three selectable "Leaders" for each side; the chosen leader allows the use of specific units and upgrades during play. While Covenant Leaders appear on the battlefield as units, human leaders do not.<ref name="ign-faction comparison2"/>

Combat in ''Halo Wars'' is [[game balance|balanced]] by a "[[rock-paper-scissors]]" system. In general, ground vehicles are effective in combat against infantry, infantry are effective against aircraft, and aircraft are effective against vehicles.<ref name="ensemble-10"/> Most units have a unique special ability; for example, human Marines throw grenades, while the "Warthog" vehicle can run over enemies. Humans have access to their ship, the ''Spirit of Fire'', and its special abilities, such as a powerful [[coilgun]] called a M.A.C. (Magnetic Accelerator Cannon). Covenant units are generally weaker than their UNSC counterparts, but can use inexpensive and powerful defensive shield generators to add protection to their bases.<ref name="ign-faction comparison2">{{cite web|author=Geddes, Ryan|date=2009-02-16|url=http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/954/954306p2.html|title=Halo Wars: UNSC vs. Covenant (page 2)|publisher=IGN|accessdate=2009-02-17|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090219155052/http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/954/954306p2.html|archivedate=2009-02-19}}</ref> Players establish their armies by building and expanding bases; these are used to train units and to allocate resources to the research of upgrades and technologies. There are a limited number of potential locations for bases on each scenario or map, making base fortification and defense a priority. A player is defeated if all his or her bases are destroyed, unless a new base is quickly established.<ref name="manual-bases">{{cite book|author=Ensemble|title=Halo Wars manual|publisher=[[Microsoft Game Studios]]|year=2009|page=11|series="Bases"}}</ref>

Units are trained, buildings upgraded, and special abilities activated using resources known as "supplies". Players can find supplies on the battlefield, or generate them by building supply structures at bases. Greater numbers of these buildings produce more supplies. Some structures and upgrades become available only after the player achieves a certain "tech level". The UNSC can achieve one to four tech levels through the construction of reactors; the Covenant builds a single temple that allows three upgrades of tech level. The Covenant has one fewer tech level, and each upgrade is more expensive. Destruction of a temple results in the loss of all tech until the temple is rebuilt.<ref>{{cite web|author=Geddes, Ryan|date=2009-02-16|url=http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/954/954306p1.html|title=Halo Wars: UNSC vs. Covenant (page 1)|publisher=IGN|accessdate=2009-02-17|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090219154427/http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/954/954306p1.html|archivedate=2009-02-19}}</ref> Each base has a limited amount of space, so players must balance their resource buildings with other facilities, such as those used to create military units.

The ''Spirit of Fire'' is sent to the ruined planet Harvest to investigate Covenant activity, where Cutter learns that the Covenant has excavated something at the planet's northern pole.<ref>"'''Cutter''': Sergeant Forge, report. / '''Forge''': Definitely plenty of bad guys down here Captain, they have found something in the ice. '''Cutter''': Damn it, that complicates our mission. Anders, what have you got? / '''Anders''': Captain, scans on the Northern Polar region shows some interesting Covenant activity on the surface. There's some kind of structure down there. / '''Serina''': What do you think they are looking for? / '''Cutter''': That's what we are here to find out.

Forge's troops defeat the Covenant forces before they can destroy the installation, and Anders arrives. She determines that the facility is an interstellar map, and recognizes a set of coordinates that points to the human colony of Arcadia.<ref>"'''Cutter''': So, all it did was point here? / '''Anders''': In the thirty seconds I had to examine the Artifact?

After repelling a Covenant counterattack on the Forerunner facility, the ''Spirit of Fire'' travels to Arcadia, where the Covenant has begun raiding local cities and slaughtering civilians. Forge contacts the local [[Spartan-II|Spartan]] special forces and assists with the evacuation process. The Covenant builds a giant energy shield to hide the construction of a gigantic Scarab super-weapon, but the UNSC forces use experimental equipment to break through.<ref>"'''Cutter''': So...it's an energy shield that they can deploy on the planet. / '''Anders''': Yes Captain, we can't see through it, but the Covenant are up to something. / '''Cutter''': Agreed, we need to find out what that is, can we use the ships cannons and take it out directly? / '''Anders''': We may destroy whatever's under there, Covenant shield technology is susceptible to super-heated plasma. Aren't we field testing some plasma based Rhinos? / '''Serina''': ''Pillar of Autumn'' inventory shows they have some prototypes. / '''Anders''': It might take some time to get the right power settings.

While the Forerunner ships are being activated, Anders escapes through a teleportation device and is rescued. Cutter decides to destroy the Forerunner fleet rather than allow the Covenant to use it. Anders formulates a plan to detonate the ship's faster-than-light drive in the planet's sun, as the explosion would cause a [[supernova]].<ref>"'''Anders''': I believe this is our best hope. The overloaded FTL reactor will cause a chain reaction in the sun. / '''Cutter''': Enough to destroy all the ships here before the Covenant can get a chance to make anything of them. / '''Anders''': Well, put simply, Captain, our reactor will cause the sun to go supernova, leaving nothing here but dust. / '''Serina''': That's the weak part of this plan, if you ask me. We've no way home without that reactor. / '''Cutter''': One problem at a time Serina. If the Covenant get their hands on these ships it will mean the end of the war. We'll take our chances here, to give humanity some hope."<U+2014>{{cite video game|title=Halo Wars |developer=Ensemble Studios |publisher=Microsoft Game Studios|platform=Xbox 360 |level=Reactor|quote=}}</ref> Before they can prepare the reactor, Forge and the Spartans are ambushed by the Arbiter and his Elites. The Spartans dispatch the aliens and Forge kills the Arbiter. The reactor is damaged during the fight, necessitating a manual detonation. Forge volunteers for the suicidal task, telling the Spartans that they will be needed in the coming fight.<ref>"'''Jerome-092''': Sir, it's already overheating. I'll have to separate the core and align them manually when they need to blow. / '''Forge''': Son, I've a feeling before this over we'll need every last Spartan in the fight. I can do this.

In 2004, the Microsoft-owned [[Ensemble Studios]]<U+2014>developers of the ''[[Age of Empires]]'' strategy series<U+2014>began work on the game that would become ''Halo Wars''.<ref name="gamasutra-halo fans appreciate">{{cite web|author=Nutt, Christian|date=2008-11-24|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=20835|title=Q&A: How Ensemble Gets Halo Fans To Appreciate Halo Wars|publisher=[[Gamasutra]]|accessdate=2009-03-12}}</ref> The studio confirmed in April 2006 that it was working on a console-based RTS. CEO Tony Goodman said, "We're giving RTS games on the console a shot. We actually spent a whole year just trying to reconstruct how the controls would work on an RTS game." Without revealing the title, Goodman described the game as being shorter and more visceral than their previous projects.<ref>{{cite web|author=Thorsen, Tor|date=2006-04-04|url=http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/strategy/halowars/news.html?sid=6147070&mode=all|title=Ensemble Studios developing MMOG--and 360 RTS?|publisher=[[Gamespot]]|accessdate=2009-03-14}}</ref>

''Halo Wars'' was originally not a ''Halo'' series title. Ensemble spent 12 to 18 months working on the control scheme, using the ''[[Age of Mythology]]'' engine. The development team hacked an ''Age of Mythology'' expansion, ''[[Age of Mythology: The Titans|The Titans]]'', and used it as a prototype for control experiments.<ref name="gamasutra-halo fans appreciate"/> Ensemble found that managing ''Age of Mythology''{{'}}s resources, units, and buildings was too difficult with the console's controller. "The answer [to making a PC-style strategy game for a console] is actually hidden in the question," Jason Pace, Microsoft Game Studio's lead producer, told ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]''. "It's something we believe has held strategy games back from succeeding on the console: you can't effectively bring a PC-style strategy game to the console because the fundamental game mechanic is tied to the mouse and keyboard input devices. It's not a question of just changing the control scheme to be gamepad friendly<U+2014>you need to adapt the underlying strategy mechanic to make sense with the new input device."<ref name="nzh-interview">{{cite news|author=Staff|date=2009-02-25|title=Halo Wars: taking the fight back in time|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]}}</ref> Senior designer Justin Rouse said that the team kept the controls from the research they had conducted, but scrapped the rest in favor of "build[ing] from the floor up what we need[ed]: the basics, the core of a strategy game."<ref>{{cite web|author=Remo, Chris|date=2008-07-18|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=19465|title=E3: Halo Wars' Rouse: Age Of Mythology Console-Controller Prototype Informed Game's Genesis|publisher=[[Gamasutra]]|accessdate=2009-03-12}}</ref> With the goal of making "the first great strategy game on the console",<ref name="worthplaying-interview1"/> Ensemble streamlined gameplay mechanics; the game's single resource is produced at each base site, which allows players to quickly cycle through their bases instead of micromanaging multiple resources at many locations.<ref name="nzh-interview"/>

Once the developers were satisfied with the controls, they presented their project to Microsoft, who suggested that it be turned into a ''Halo'' game.<ref name="worthplaying-interview1">{{cite web|author=Staff|date=2009-02-22|url=http://www.worthplaying.com/article.php?sid=60100|title='Halo Wars' Developer Interview Part 1|publisher=Worth Playing|accessdate=2009-03-14}}</ref> Although Ensemble had to re-create all of Bungie's assets from scratch, Bungie had produced a large amount of reference material for the [[Halo (2009 film)|''Halo'' film adaptation]] that the ''Halo Wars'' team used for inspiration. Another reference point was art from the ''Halo'' first-person shooters; however, as the art was from a forward perspective and ''Halo Wars'' takes place from a [[bird's-eye view]], the team exaggerated shapes to make the units recognizable. Lead designer [[Graeme Devine]] noted that the Warthog Jeep is "actually jumping three times as high as it does in ''Halo'', and it goes four times faster than it does in ''Halo'', and all these things<U+2014>but it looks the same. Very different, between look and accuracy."<ref name="gamasutra-halo fans appreciate"/> To ensure artistic continuity between ''Halo Wars'' and previous games in the series, Ensemble created a set of guidelines for their artists to follow; for example, the Covenant were to retain their curvy, organic look, while the Forerunner and UNSC were to keep the same geometry angles. UNSC structures and units were given a green tint, with gold specular highlights. The Covenant were textured with a repeating honeycomb pattern, with small blue lights against a purple base color.<ref>{{cite web|author=Slusser, Paul|date=2009-06-30|url=http://www.halowars.com/news/devblog/archive/2009/06/23/What-it-takes-to-make-Halo-Wars-art_2C00_-look-like-Halo_3F00_.aspx|title=What it takes to make Halo Wars art look like Halo|work=HaloWars.com|publisher=Robot Entertainment|accessdate=2009-06-30}}</ref>

Devine described the challenge of developing ''Halo Wars'' as "getting ''Halo'' fans to play a realtime strategy game, and getting realtime strategy fans to play a ''Halo'' game."<ref name="gamasutra-halo fans appreciate"/><ref>{{cite web|author=X-Play|date=2008-12-18|url=http://www.g4tv.com/xplay/videos/35655/All_Access_Preview_Halo_Wars.html|title=All Access Preview: Halo Wars|publisher=[[G4tv]]|accessdate=2009-02-09}}</ref> "Fans of the [first-person shooter] series have very strong expectations for how a ''Halo'' games looks, feels and plays. ''Halo'' is all about heroic action to save humanity, mega-battles across the galaxy, visceral, highly-tuned combat and heart-pounding tension," Pace said. These themes were considered fundamental to the ''Halo'' experience, and so Ensemble tried to replicate them for ''Halo Wars''.<ref name="nzh-interview"/> Early in play tests, the developers watched devoted ''Halo'' fans play the game; their feedback led to the development of special abilities, which, according to Devine, enhanced the ''Halo'' feel.<ref name="worthplaying-interview1"/> Ensemble initially considered making the Flood a playable race, but this idea did not progress beyond the concept stage. According to Devine, this was largely because the Flood would have needed to be similar to ''[[StarCraft]]''{{'}}s [[Zerg]], in order to maintain balance with the UNSC and Covenant. This did not match the Flood's role as "the single scariest thing in the galaxy".<ref name="1up-podcast">{{cite web|author=Staff|date=2008-11-18|url=http://download.gamevideos.com/Podcasts/EGM/1UFM111808.mp3|title=1UP FM Podcast: Graeme Devine and Dave Pottinger|publisher=[[1UP.com]]|accessdate=2009-02-15}}</ref>

Because of the [[Master Chief (Halo)|Master Chief]]'s large role in previous games, significant effort was expended on the Spartan units. Lead programmer [[Dave Pottinger]] said the design team "started out just accepting and embracing the fact that the Spartans have to be the coolest unit in the game. If they're not, it's not going to meet the ''Halo'' fans' expectations."<ref name="worthplaying-interview2"/> To position the Spartans as "[[kingmaker]]s" in gameplay, the team gave them what it considered to be the "coolest" unit ability: hijacking enemy vehicles. The developers hoped players would become attached to individual Spartans in the campaign and gave each one an individual name; skirmish units were left nameless.<ref name="worthplaying-interview2">{{cite web|author=Staff|date=2009-02-23|url=http://www.worthplaying.com/article.php?sid=60111|title='Halo Wars' Developer Interview Part 2|publisher=Worth Playing|accessdate=2009-03-15}}</ref> The character design of the Spartans was meant to emphasize their relative inexperience and the setting of the game, which takes place decades before the events of the main trilogy. Devine commented on the Spartans' look:
<blockquote>...We felt because it was 20 years earlier, these are much younger Spartans. They aren't quite as experienced as Master Chief, and we looked a lot at combat infantry going into actual wars, and typically at the beginning of a war, especially the Vietnam War, if you look at the infantry, they're all loaded up. They have all the backpacks on, they have all the belts on, every single bit of armor is there, and they're carrying around lots of armor. At the end of the war, they've lost it all and just carry what they need. This is all they have. So if you look at our Spartans, they have more pieces of armor on going into the war. They have more markings on there, more pieces of armor. They've still got the belts on, they're still carrying around everything.<ref name="worthplaying-interview1"/></blockquote>

Ensemble expanded the ''Halo'' universe during the game's development, in order to create enough units to give players strategic options. Among the new units was the Gorgon, a biped [[mecha|mech]] that used weapons called Needlers to destroy light aircraft. However, Ensemble later realized that the Gorgon invalidated a rule they had established: "anything with two legs that walks" was an infantry unit. Instead, the team added a new aircraft called the Vampire.<ref name="1up-halo wars prev pottinger"/> The UNSC, meanwhile, lacked a melee unit to match the Covenant's hand-to-hand power. Ensemble considered using the original, less advanced Spartan Mark I suits of armor, in keeping with ''Halo'' lore, but once added these units were indistinguishable from Spartans in appearance. Instead, they created a lumbering, mechanized unit called the Cyclops, a nod to ''Age of Mythology''.<ref name="1up-halo wars prev pottinger">{{cite web|author=Staff, David Pottinger|date=2009-01-16|url=http://www.1up.com/do/previewPage?cId=3172311|title=Previews: Halo Wars|publisher=[[1UP.com]]|accessdate=2009-03-14}}</ref>

Time constraints prevented many elements from appearing in the final game. One such missing feature was a fatality system by which Spartans or Covenant leaders could inflict massive damage on large groups of units. Pottinger said that the animations, while interesting, did not mesh with the fast-paced combat of ''Halo Wars'' and raised balance concerns. Other elements based on ''Halo'' fiction did not work in a strategy game.<ref name="oxm-pottinger podcast"/> Although more than 100 people worked on the project, which cost tens of millions of dollars,<ref>{{cite news|author=Ahmed, Murad; Nigel Kendall|date=2009-02-28|title=Here we go again, as game makers catch Hollywood's sequel disease|work=[[The Times]]|page=31}}</ref> a Covenant campaign was never realized because of a lack of manpower and money.<ref name="oxm-pottinger podcast"/>

{{Halo Wars tracklist}}
''Halo Wars''{{'}} music was composed by [[Stephen Rippy]], the composer for all of the ''Age of Empires'' games. Rippy wanted to write new material while maintaining continuity by reusing iconic elements of the ''Halo'' trilogy's music, written by [[Martin O'Donnell]] and partner [[Michael Salvatori]].<ref name="m4g-rippy interview1">{{cite web|author=Staff|date=2008-04-28|url=http://www.music4games.net/Features_Display.aspx?id=259|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090423113412/http://music4games.net/Features_Display.aspx?id=259|archivedate=2009-04-23|title=Halo Wars interview with Ensemble's Audio Director and Lead Composer Stephen Rippy|publisher=[[Music4Games]]|accessdate=2009-02-16}}</ref> Consultation with O'Donnell and Salvatori finished before Rippy became involved in the project, but the composer sent a compact disc of his work to O'Donnell halfway through the writing process.<ref name="ign-rippy interview1">{{cite web|author=Staff|date=2009-03-06|url=http://music.ign.com/articles/960/960175p1.html|title=Halo Wars Music Attack; composer Stephen Rippy discusses his epic score|publisher=IGN|accessdate=2009-03-09}}</ref> Before starting work on ''Halo Wars'', Rippy listened to previous ''Halo'' soundtracks and searched for useful material in discarded Ensemble projects; "I'm a big fan of both cataloging that stuff and stealing from it without remorse," Rippy said. "Sometimes you don<U+2019>t know what you<U+2019>ve got until you really, really need it."<ref name="halowars-over and out"/> Rippy and audio lead Kevin McMullan examined O'Donnell's tracks to identify elements to reuse in ''Halo Wars''.<ref name="halowars-over and out">{{cite web|author=[[Stephen Rippy|Rippy, Stephen]]|date=2008-12-12|url=http://halowars.com/news/articles/archive/2008/12/12/_2200_Over-and-Out_2200_.aspx |title=Over and Out|work=HaloWars.com|publisher=Ensemble Studios|accessdate=2009-02-10}}</ref> Foregoing his usual method of writing melodies before determining the method of sound production, Rippy built melodies around synthesizer patches or drum loops. He felt that scoring for science fiction was a change of pace from his previous work, which was written for historical settings.<ref name="ign-rippy interview1"/>

Rippy began writing music for the game in April 2007.<ref name="m4g-rippy interview2">{{cite web|author=Staff|date=2009-02-02|url=http://www.music4games.net/Features_Display.aspx?id=331|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090205073554/http://music4games.net/Features_Display.aspx?id=331|archivedate=2009-02-05|title=Behind the Music of Halo Wars|publisher=[[Music4Games]]|accessdate=2009-02-17}}</ref> "Some of the plot points of Halo Wars revolve around discovery, and I think that was my favorite idea to write to<U+2014>that sense of, 'no one's seen this before,'" he said.<ref name="ign-rippy interview1"/> The first two tracks combined repurposed elements from past projects with his efforts to convey the ''Halo'' sound. "Flollo" contained musical ideas Rippy had experimented with since his last project, ''[[Age of Empires III: The WarChiefs]]''. "Bad Here Day" was the first piece in which he tried to incorporate the "''Halo'' sound". Rippy felt it important to avoid repeating too many old themes because he wanted the game to have its own identity;<ref name="m4g-rippy interview2"/> however, he wanted to continue to incorporate choir and piano, elements he believed to be integral to the sound of previous ''Halo'' games.<ref name="gamezone-ripppy interview"/> In adherence to an Ensemble Studios tradition, the tracks are often named after coined phrases and inside jokes, rather than in-game events.<ref name="halowars-over and out"/>

By the end of 2007, Rippy had completed all of the gameplay music, including end credits, battle themes, and ambient world tracks. In the game's skirmish mode, the music reflects the environment rather than the warring factions.<ref name="m4g-rippy interview2"/> To ensure that the character of the music changed depending on the environment, he followed self-imposed rules; one environment could feature guitars, but not piano, for instance. To musically unify each world, he added a short introductory piece containing common elements.<ref name="gamezone-ripppy interview"/> In contrast with the skirmish mode, the campaign mode contains different recurring melodies for each major character and the human ship ''Spirit of Fire''.<ref name="gamezone-ripppy interview">{{cite web|author=Bedegian, Louis|date=2009-02-13|url=http://www.gamezone.com/news/02_13_09_09_00AM.htm|title=GameZone Chats with Halo Wars Composer Stephen Rippy|publisher=[[GameZone]]|accessdate=2009-02-17}}</ref> Rippy's most intensive work period was January 2008, when he began writing music for the game's cinematics; by this point, he had been working on the score for nine months.<ref name="halowars-over and out"/> Rippy finished the score by February 2008,<ref name="ign-rippy interview2">{{cite web|author=Staff|date=2009-03-06|url=http://music.ign.com/articles/960/960175p2.html|title=Halo Wars Music Attack (page 2)|publisher=IGN|accessdate=2009-03-09}}</ref> and, after three months, all tracks were ready to be recorded.<ref name="halowars-big al">{{cite web|author=Staff|date=2008-04-28|url=http://www.halowars.com/news/articles/archive/2008/04/28/Halo-Wars-Monthly-Update-4.28.08.aspx |title=Halo Wars Monthly Update 4.28.08|work=HaloWars.com|publisher=Ensemble Studios|accessdate=2009-02-10}}</ref>

Although the previous live orchestrations for ''Halo'' games were performed by the Northwest Sinfonia in [[Seattle, Washington]], Rippy chose the FILMharmonic Orchestra of [[Prague]] to record ''Halo Wars''{{'}} music. Rippy had been in Prague attending recording sessions for ''[[Age of Empires III: The Asian Dynasties]]'' and loved both the city and the sound the orchestra produced. The lower cost of recording in Eastern Europe was an additional benefit.<ref name="m4g-rippy interview2"/> The March 10<U+2013>15 recording sessions involved 24 vocalists and 45 instrumentalists; choir and string sections were later [[Overdubbing|overdubbed]] to enlarge the sound. In all, roughly 65&nbsp;minutes of ''Halo Wars''{{'}} 75-minute score were recorded in Prague.<ref name="m4g-rippy interview1"/> The final touches and production took place in Seattle; O'Donnell attended one of the mixing sessions.<ref name="m4g-rippy interview2"/>

Rippy used the [[Audiokinetic Wwise]] pipeline to create [[dynamic music]] that changes with the action in the game. Although Rippy used Wwise's tools only for dynamic music, they made audio system setup much easier than in previous Ensemble games.<ref name="m4g-rippy interview2"/> For each battle sequence, the musical cue was divided into sections and mixed differently for each section. "When a cue is triggered, an intro plays and then the game randomly picks between all of those elements for as long as the battle continues," Rippy explained. "Once it's over, an outro plays and then it's back to the regular "world" music. It was an interesting way to work, and I'd like to push it further if there<U+2019>s an opportunity in the future."<ref name="gamezone-ripppy interview"/>

Four tracks from ''Halo Wars'' were included as a preview on a bonus DVD bundled with ''Halo Trilogy<U+2014>The Complete Original Soundtracks'', a December 2008 compilation of previous ''Halo'' music. The tracks were mixed in [[Dolby Digital]] 5.1-channel [[Surround Sound]] and packaged with video of recording sessions and the "Five Long Years" trailer.<ref>{{cite web|author=Sumthing|date=2008-12-01|url=http://www.music4games.net/News_Display.aspx?id=1112|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100528020149/http://www.music4games.net/News_Display.aspx?id=1112|archivedate=2010-05-28|title=Sumthing Else Music Works announces release of Halo Trilogy-The Complete Original Soundtracks|publisher=[[Music4Games]]|accessdate=2009-02-16}}</ref> The soundtrack was released on February 17 as a standalone compact disc and as a [[music download|digital download]].<ref name="soundtrack-announce">{{cite web|author=Microsoft, Sumthing Else Music Works|date=2009-01-15|url=http://www.music4games.net/News_Display.aspx?id=1137|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090219100309/http://music4games.net/News_Display.aspx?id=1137|archivedate=2009-02-19|title=Sumthing announces the release of Halo Wars Original Soundtrack|publisher=[[Music4Games]]|accessdate=2009-02-15}}</ref> [[AOL Radio]] secured the exclusive rights to premiere the soundtrack early, playing a new track at the beginning of every hour.<ref>{{cite web|author=Mullen, Michael|date=2009-02-09|url=http://www.gamedaily.com/games/halo-wars/xbox-360/game-features/aol-radio-scores-halo-wars-soundtrack-premiere/|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090316041649/http://gamedaily.com/games/halo-wars/xbox-360/game-features/aol-radio-scores-halo-wars-soundtrack-premiere/?|archivedate=2009-03-16|title=AOL Radio Scores Halo Wars Soundtrack Premiere|publisher=[[GameDaily]]|accessdate=2009-03-01}}</ref>

After Ensemble's closing, Robot Entertainment announced that it was developing [[downloadable content]] (DLC) for ''Halo Wars''.<ref name="eurogamer-dlc">{{cite web|author=Bramwell, Tom|date=2009-02-18|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/new-dev-working-on-halo-wars-dlc|title=New dev working on Halo Wars DLC|publisher=[[Eurogamer]]|accessdate=2009-03-14}}</ref> Pottinger described support as ongoing rather than a one-time effort and compared it to Bungie's [[Halo 3 Legendary Map Pack|post-launch additions to ''Halo 3'']]. He stated that Robot would also work on balance issues, bug fixes, and other patches.<ref name="oxm-pottinger podcast"/>

The first DLC package, Strategic Options, added three new multiplayer modes. "Keepaway" is similar to  [[capture the flag]]; in it, players try to capture and hold Forerunner units. In "Tug-of-war", players earn points by fielding large armies and destroying enemy units. In "Reinforcement", players receive units as reinforcements, rather than training them at bases. The amount of available resources and reactors determines which types of units are deployed and the upgrades they can earn.<ref name="New Multiplayer Modes Coming to Halo Wars">{{cite web|author=Molina, Brett|date=2009-04-21|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/gamehunters/post/2009/04/65800719/1|title=New multiplayer modes coming to 'Halo Wars'|publisher=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=2009-04-21}}</ref> Strategic Options was released on May 19, 2009,<ref>{{cite web|author=Berardini, C<U+00E9>sar|date=2009-05-19|url=http://news.teamxbox.com/xbox/19673/Halo-Wars-Strategic-Options-Addon-Pack-Available-Now/|title=Strategic Options addon pack available now|publisher=[[TeamXbox]]|accessdate=2009-06-10}}</ref> after a [[patch (computing)|patch]] that addressed [[software bug]]s and [[game balance]] issues.<ref>{{cite web|author=Watts, Steve|date=2009-05-12|url=http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3174179|title=Halo Wars Patch to Prep for DLC|publisher=[[1UP.com]]|accessdate=2009-05-18}}</ref> The update garnered criticism for its small size (2&nbsp;[[megabytes]]) and high price (800&nbsp;[[Microsoft points]]).

''Halo Wars'' garnered generally positive reviews; the game has an 82% average on aggregate web sites [[Metacritic]] and [[Game Rankings]].<ref name="gamerankings-halo wars"/><ref name="metacritic-halo wars"/> Critics were split on whether ''Halo Wars'' was a successful console translation of the RTS genre. [[GameSpy]]'s Allen Rausch argued that, as ''[[Halo: Combat Evolved]]'' showed that first-person shooters could work on consoles, ''Halo Wars'' "is an RTS ... on a console ... and it works".<ref name="gamespy-review1"/> Tom Price of [[TeamXbox]] said that gamers have been waiting a long time for a console RTS "to get it right", and ''Halo Wars'' did so;<ref name="teamxbox-review1">{{cite web|author=Price, Tom|date=2009-02-20|url=http://reviews.teamxbox.com/xbox-360/1659/Halo-Wars/p1/|title=Halo Wars Review (Xbox 360)|publisher=[[TeamXbox]]|accessdate=2009-03-14}}</ref> reviewers for ''[[Official Xbox Magazine]]'' credited Ensemble with creating a strategy game that felt "absolutely at home on the console", rather than a "poorly shoehorned ... port" of a PC game with clumsy controls.<ref name="oxm-review"/> [[1UP.com|1UP]]'s Thierry Nguyen was neutral about whether it was a good RTS game or ''Halo'' title, but called it a "solid beginning towards what could be a really good console RTS".<ref name="1up-review"/> [[Digital Trends]]' Scott Steinberg said that, while not perfect, ''Halo Wars'' made a strong case for the viability of RTS on consoles; "There's certainly the potential to have PC holdouts seriously reconsidering hoisting the controller."<ref>{{cite news|author=Snider, Mike|authorlink=Mike Snider (writer)|date=2009-03-03|url=http://www.usatoday.com/tech/gaming/2009-03-02-strategy-main_N.htm|title=Digital Download: Real-time strategy is name of game|work=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=2009-03-10}}</ref> Peter Hartlaub of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' offered a dismissive summation of the game as "a remedial game<U+2014>real-time strategy for dummies", and stated that the game offered relatively little innovation when compared to other ''Halo'' titles.<ref>{{cite news|author=Hartlaub, Peter|date=2009-03-03|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/03/02/DDAA166IUH.DTL|title=Halo offers a lite version|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|accessdate=2009-03-14}}</ref>

Reviewers generally praised ''Halo Wars''{{'}}s controls. Critics who were less experienced RTS players, such as Darren Zenko of the ''[[Toronto Star]]'', appreciated the streamlined RTS experience.<ref name="toronto star-review">{{cite news|author=Zenko, Darren|date=2009-03-14|url=http://www.thestar.com/Entertainment/article/601428|title=Halo Wars' smart design lures you in|work=[[Toronto Star]]|accessdate=2009-04-01}}</ref> In contrast, critics such as Luke Anderson of [[GameSpot]] said that the game lacked the depth necessary to attract more seasoned RTS players.<ref name="gamespot-review1"/> Some critics were frustrated by the lack of control features<U+2014>specifically, the ability to create and manage groups of units,<ref name="1up-review"/><ref name="gamepro-review2">{{cite web|author=Lewis, Cameron|date=2009-03-03|url=http://www.gamepro.com/article/reviews/208905/halo-wars-page-2-of-3/|title=Halo Wars (page 2)|work=[[GamePro]]|accessdate=2009-03-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Hill, Jason|date=2009-03-05|title=Halo Wars; Games|work=[[The Age]]|page=24}}</ref> the lack of hotkeys, the inability to set rally points for different units,<ref name="gamespot-review1"/> and the need to return to the base to adjust production.<ref name="gamespot-review1"/> Nguyen wrote that "finesse maneuvers [...] are more difficult to pull off than they should be".<ref name="1up-review"/> Brett Molina of ''[[USA Today]]'' said that experts would find the action oversimplified, but that the game "is an excellent choice for fans of the Halo universe and players new to real-time strategy".<ref name="usa today-review">{{cite news|author=Molina, Brett|date=2009-03-06|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/gamehunters/post/2009/03/63738875/1|title=Review: 'Halo Wars' delivers simple, satisfying real-time strategy|work=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=2009-03-14}}</ref> Reviewers for GameSpy, G4tv, and Eurogamer stated that the controls worked well mainly because the developers omitted features to make most options quickly available;<ref name="g4tv-review"/><ref name="eurog-review2"/> for example, limiting base construction to select areas made sure players could easily find their buildings.<ref name="gamespy-review1"/>

Reviewers considered the factions balanced. [[Eurogamer]]'s [[Kieron Gillen]] commented that the Covenant was harder to master, especially because the campaign served as a tutorial for the UNSC, but no similar introduction was available for the Covenant.<ref name="eurog-review1"/> However, he said the two sides were "authentically different", and each offered its own challenges to players.<ref name="eurog-review2">{{cite web|author=Gillen, Kieron|authorlink=Kieron Gillen|date=2009-02-20|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/halo-wars-review?page=2|title=Halo Wars review (page 2)|publisher=[[Eurogamer]]|accessdate=2009-03-14}}</ref> Some critics, such as Nick Cowen of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', wished that the Flood was a playable faction;<ref name="telegraph-review"/> in contrast, Ryan Geddes of [[IGN]] disliked the Flood and appreciated their exclusion.<ref name="ign-review3">{{cite web|author=Geddes, Ryan|date=2009-02-20|url=http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/955/955576p3.html|title=Halo Wars Review (page 3)|publisher=IGN|accessdate=2009-02-20}}</ref> Will Porter of IGN UK enjoyed the rock-paper-scissors RTS mechanics, but said that "since the game is singularly crap at indicating which units are rocks and which scissors," players had to learn which units were best via trial and error, an issue that was more prevalent with the Covenant.<ref name="ignuk-review1"/>

Publications judged the multiplayer aspect of the game well. Wilcox noted that, although the multiplayer mode "added [nothing] new [to RTS games], at the very least it's a solid experience that expands the longevity of ''Halo Wars''."<ref name="tvg-review"/> Adam Biessener of ''[[Game Informer]]'' wrote that ''Halo Wars'' gameplay was better against human players, as campaign "gimmicks" and poor artificial intelligence were not an issue.<ref name="gi-review"/> ''The Mirror''{{'}}s Kevin Lynch found fault with the "limited" variety of game modes.<ref>{{cite news|author=Lynch, Kevin|date=2009-03-06|title=Halo Wars; Games Xbox 360|work=[[Daily Mirror|The Mirror]]|page=15}}</ref>

Critics generally agreed that Ensemble re-created the ''Halo'' universe's aesthetic well. Gillen said knowledge of the game universe could alleviate some issues of player ignorance regarding units' actions: "It's not just the geek thrill of seeing a Scarab in action<U+2014>it's that you understand what the Scarab means on the battlefield (trouble)," he wrote. "We know which characters are best against tanks, and which are probably best in special vehicles."<ref name="eurog-review1"/> Nguyen said that, although the core units meshed well, the inclusion of Ensemble-developed units gave ''Halo Wars'' the feeling of a generic science-fiction title.<ref name="1up-review"/> While giving the game a mixed review, Anderson said that the authentic-looking units and environments went a long way to integrating the game with the rest of the series.<ref name="gamespot-review1"/> Wilcox commented that with the ''Halo''-inspired menu system and Rippy's score, "before the campaign even begins, the message is clear: this is still very much a ''Halo'' game."<ref name="tvg-review"/> Overall, ''Halo Wars'' was judged a fitting final game for Ensemble.<ref name="gi-review"/><ref name="oxm-review"/><ref name="eurog-review2"/><ref name="tvg-review"/>
