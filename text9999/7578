{{History of Iran}}

The '''Parthian Empire''' ({{IPAc-en|<U+02C8>|p|<U+0251>r|<U+03B8>|i|<U+0259>n}}; 247&nbsp;BC <U+2013> 224&nbsp;AD), also known as the '''Arsacid Empire''' {{IPAc-en|<U+02C8>|<U+0251>r|s|<U+0259>|s|<U+026A>|d}},<ref>From [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|<U+1F08><U+03C1><U+03C3><U+03AC><U+03BA><U+03B7><U+03C2>}} ''Arsak<U+0113>s'', from [[Parthian language|Parthian]] {{lang|xpr|<U+00010B40><U+00010B53><U+00010B54><U+00010B4A>}} ''Ar<U+0161>ak''.</ref> was a major [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] political and cultural power in [[ancient Iran]], also known as [[Persia|ancient Persia]].<ref>{{harvnb|Waters|1974|p=424}}.</ref> Its latter name comes from [[Arsaces I of Parthia]]<ref>{{harvnb|Brosius|2006|p=84}}</ref> who, as leader of the [[Parni]] tribe, founded it in the mid-3rd century BC when he conquered the region of [[Parthia]]<ref>"roughly western [[Greater Khorasan|Khurasan]]" {{harvnb|Bickerman|1983|p=6}}.</ref> in [[Iran]]'s northeast, then a [[satrapy]] (province) in rebellion against the [[Seleucid Empire]]. [[Mithridates I of Parthia]] (r.&nbsp;''c''.&nbsp;171<U+2013>138&nbsp;BC) greatly expanded the empire by seizing [[Media (region)|Media]] and [[Mesopotamia]] from the Seleucids. At its height, the Parthian Empire stretched from the northern reaches of the [[Euphrates]], in what is now central-eastern [[Turkey]], to eastern [[Iran]]. The empire, located on the [[Silk Road]] trade route between the [[Roman Empire]] in the [[Mediterranean Basin]] and the [[Han Empire]] of [[China]], became a center of trade and commerce.

The Parthians largely adopted the art, architecture, religious beliefs, and royal insignia of their culturally heterogeneous empire, which encompassed [[Culture of Iran|Persian]], [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]], and regional cultures. For about the first half of its existence, the Arsacid court adopted elements of [[Culture of Greece|Greek culture]], though it eventually saw a gradual revival of [[Religion and culture in ancient Iran|Iranian traditions]]. The Arsacid rulers were titled the "[[King of Kings]]", as a claim to be the heirs to the [[Achaemenid Empire]]; indeed, they accepted many local kings as [[vassal]]s where the Achaemenids would have had centrally appointed, albeit largely autonomous, satraps. The court did appoint a small number of satraps, largely outside Iran, but these satrapies were smaller and less powerful than the Achaemenid potentates. With the expansion of Arsacid power, the seat of central government shifted from [[Nisa, Turkmenistan|Nisa]] to [[Ctesiphon]] along the [[Tigris]] (south of modern [[Baghdad]], Iraq), although several other sites also served as capitals.

The earliest enemies of the Parthians were the [[Seleucid<U+2013>Parthian wars|Seleucids]] in the west and the [[Scythians]] in the east. However, as Parthia expanded westward, they came into conflict with the [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Kingdom of Armenia]], and eventually the late [[Roman Republic]]. Rome and Parthia competed with each other to establish the [[List of kings of Armenia|kings of Armenia]] as their [[Client state|subordinate clients]]. The Parthians soundly defeated [[Marcus Licinius Crassus]] at the [[Battle of Carrhae]] in 53&nbsp;BC, and in 40<U+2013>39&nbsp;BC, Parthian forces captured the whole of the [[Levant]] except [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] from [[Ancient Rome|the Romans]]. However, [[Mark Antony]] led a [[Antony's Parthian War|counterattack]] against Parthia, although his successes were generally achieved in his absence, under the leadership of his lieutenant [[Publius Ventidius Bassus|Ventidius]]. Also, various Roman emperors or their appointed generals invaded Mesopotamia in the course of the several [[Roman-Parthian Wars]], which ensued during the next few centuries. The Romans captured the cities of [[Seleucia]] and Ctesiphon on multiple occasions during these conflicts, but were never able to hold onto them. Frequent civil war between Parthian contenders to the throne proved more dangerous than foreign invasion, and Parthian power evaporated when [[Ardashir I]], ruler of [[Estakhr]] in [[Fars Province|Fars]], revolted against the Arsacids and killed their last ruler, [[Artabanus IV of Parthia|Artabanus IV]], in 224&nbsp;AD. Ardashir established the [[Sassanid Empire]], which ruled Iran and much of the Near East until the [[Muslim conquests]] of the 7th century AD, although the Arsacid dynasty lived on through the [[Arsacid Dynasty of Armenia]].

Native Parthian sources, written in [[Parthian language|Parthian]], [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] and other languages, are scarce when compared to Sassanid and even earlier Achaemenid sources. Aside from scattered [[cuneiform]] tablets, fragmentary [[ostraca]], rock inscriptions, [[drachma]] coins, and the chance survival of some [[parchment]] documents, much of Parthian history is only known through external sources. These include mainly [[Greek historiography|Greek]] and [[Roman historiography|Roman histories]], but also [[Chinese historiography|Chinese histories]], prompted by the market for Chinese goods in Parthia. [[Parthian art]]work is viewed by historians as a valid source for understanding aspects of society and culture that are otherwise absent in textual sources.

==History of the Parthian Empire==

===Origins and establishment===

{{further|Parni conquest of Parthia}}
Before [[Arsaces I of Parthia]] founded the Arsacid Dynasty, he was chieftain of the [[Parni]], an ancient [[Central-Asia]]n tribe of [[Iranian peoples]] and one of several [[nomad]]ic tribes within the confederation of the [[Dahae]].<ref>{{harvnb|Katouzian|2009|p=41}}; {{harvnb|Curtis|2007|p=7}}; {{harvnb|Bivar|1983|pp=24<U+2013>27}}; {{harvnb|Brosius|2006|pp=83<U+2013>84}}</ref> The Parni most likely spoke an [[eastern Iranian language]], in contrast to the [[Western Iranian languages|northwestern Iranian language]] spoken at the time in [[Parthia]].<ref>{{harvnb|Bivar|1983|p=24}}; {{harvnb|Brosius|2006|p=84}}</ref> The latter was a northeastern province, first under the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]], and then the [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid]] empires.<ref>{{harvnb|Bivar|1983|pp=24<U+2013>27}}; {{harvnb|Brosius|2006|pp=83<U+2013>84}}</ref> After conquering the region, the Parni adopted [[Parthian language|Parthian]] as the official court language, speaking it alongside [[Middle Persian]], [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Akkadian language|Babylonian]], [[Sogdian language|Sogdian]] and other languages in the multilingual territories they would conquer.<ref>{{harvnb|Curtis|2007|pp=7<U+2013>8}}; {{harvnb|Brosius|2006|pp=83<U+2013>84}}</ref>

Why the Arsacid court retroactively chose 247&nbsp;BC as the first year of the Arsacid era is uncertain. [[Adrian David Hugh Bivar|A.D.H. Bivar]] concludes that this was the year the Seleucids lost control of Parthia to [[Andragoras (3rd century BC)|Andragoras]], the appointed [[satrap]] who rebelled against them. Hence, Arsaces I "backdated his [[regnal year]]s" to the moment when Seleucid control over Parthia ceased.<ref name="bivar_1983_28-29">{{harvnb|Bivar|1983|pp=28<U+2013>29}}</ref> However, Vesta Sarkhosh Curtis asserts that this was simply the year Arsaces was made chief of the Parni tribe.<ref name="curtis_2007_7">{{harvnb|Curtis|2007|p=7}}</ref> Homa Katouzian<ref name="katouzian 2009 41">{{harvnb|Katouzian|2009|p=41}}</ref> and Gene Ralph Garthwaite<ref name="garthwaite_2005_67">{{harvnb|Garthwaite|2005|p=67}}</ref> claim it was the year Arsaces conquered Parthia and expelled the Seleucid authorities, yet Curtis<ref name="curtis_2007_7"/> and Maria Brosius<ref name="brosius_2006_85">{{harvnb|Brosius|2006|p=85}}</ref> state that Andragoras was not [[Parni conquest of Parthia|overthrown by the Arsacids]] until 238&nbsp;BC.

It is unclear who immediately succeeded Arsaces I. Bivar<ref>{{harvnb|Bivar|1983|pp=29<U+2013>31}}</ref> and Katouzian<ref name="katouzian 2009 41"/> affirm that it was his brother [[Tiridates I of Parthia]], who in turn was succeeded by his son [[Arsaces II of Parthia]] in 211&nbsp;BC. Yet Curtis<ref name="curtis_2007_8">{{harvnb|Curtis|2007|p=8}}</ref> and Brosius<ref name="brosius_2006_86">{{harvnb|Brosius|2006|p=86}}</ref> state that Arsaces II was the immediate successor of Arsaces I, with Curtis claiming the succession took place in 211&nbsp;BC, and Brosius in 217&nbsp;BC. Bivar insists that 138&nbsp;BC, the last regnal year of Mithridates I, is "the first precisely established regnal date of Parthian history."<ref>{{harvnb|Bivar|1983|p=36}}</ref> Due to these and other discrepancies, Bivar outlines [[List of Parthian kings|two distinct royal chronologies]] accepted by historians.<ref name="bivar_1983_98-99">{{harvnb|Bivar|1983|pp=98<U+2013>99}}</ref> Later on, some of the Parthian Kings would claim Achaemenid descent. The claim has recently received support from numismatic and other written evidence suggesting that both Achaemenid and Parthian kings suffered from the hereditary disease [[neurofibromatosis]].<ref>{{Citation|author=Ashrafian, Hutan.|title=Limb gigantism, neurofibromatosis and royal heredity in the Ancient World 2500 years ago: Achaemenids and Parthians|journal= J Plast Reconstr Aesthet Surg|volume=64|year=2011|page=557|doi= 10.1016/j.bjps.2010.08.025|url= http://www.jprasurg.com/article/S1748-6815(10)00521-8/pdf%7C|issue=4|postscript=.|pmid=20832372}}</ref>

For a time, Arsaces consolidated his position in Parthia and [[Hyrcania]] by taking advantage of the invasion of Seleucid territory in the west by [[Ptolemy III Euergetes]] (''r''.&nbsp;246<U+2013>222&nbsp;BC) of [[History of Ptolemaic Egypt|Egypt]]. This conflict with Ptolemy, the [[Syrian Wars#Third Syrian War (246-241 BC)|Third Syrian War]] (246<U+2013>241&nbsp;BC), also allowed [[Diodotus I]] to rebel and form the [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom]] in Central Asia.<ref name="brosius_2006_85"/> The latter's successor, [[Diodotus II]], formed an alliance with Arsaces against the Seleucids, but Arsaces was temporarily driven from Parthia by the forces of [[Seleucus II Callinicus]] (''r''.&nbsp;246<U+2013>225&nbsp;BC).<ref name="brosius_2006_85-86">{{harvnb|Brosius|2006|pp=85<U+2013>86}}</ref> After spending some time in exile among the nomadic [[Apasiacae]] tribe, Arsaces led a counterattack and recaptured Parthia. Seleucus II's successor, [[Antiochus III the Great]] (''r''.&nbsp;222<U+2013>187&nbsp;BC), was unable to immediately retaliate because his troops were engaged in putting down the rebellion of [[Molon]] in [[Media (region)|Media]].<ref name="brosius_2006_85-86"/>

Antiochus III launched a massive campaign to retake Parthia and Bactria in 210 or 209&nbsp;BC. He was unsuccessful, but did negotiate a peace settlement with Arsaces II. The latter was granted the title of king ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: ''[[basileus]]'') in return for his submission to Antiochus III as his superior.<ref name="bivar_1983_29 brosius_2006_86 kennedy_1996_74">{{harvnb|Bivar|1983|p=29}}; {{harvnb|Brosius|2006|p=86}}; {{harvnb|Kennedy|1996|p=74}}</ref> The Seleucids were unable to further intervene in Parthian affairs following increasing encroachment by the [[Roman Republic]] and the Seleucid [[Battle of Magnesia|defeat at Magnesia]] in 190&nbsp;BC.<ref name="bivar_1983_29 brosius_2006_86 kennedy_1996_74"/> [[Phriapatius of Parthia]] (''r''.

Phraates I is recorded as expanding Parthia's control past the [[Gates of Alexander]] and occupied [[Apamea Ragiana]], the locations of which are unknown.<ref>{{harvnb|Bivar|1983|p=31}}</ref> Yet the greatest expansion of Parthian power and territory took place during the reign of his brother and successor [[Mithridates I of Parthia]] (r.

Relations between Parthia and Greco-Bactria deteriorated after the death of Diodotus II, when Mithridates' forces captured two [[Eparchy|eparchies]] of the latter kingdom, then under [[Eucratides I]] (''r''.

Whereas [[Hecatompylos]] had served as the first Parthian capital, Mithridates established royal residences at Seleucia, Ecbatana, [[Ctesiphon]] and his newly founded city, Mithradatkert ([[Nisa, Turkmenistan]]), where the tombs of the Arsacid kings were built and maintained.<ref>{{harvnb|Brosius|2006|pp=103, 110<U+2013>113}}</ref> Ecbatana became the main summertime residence for the Arsacid royalty.<ref>{{harvnb|Kennedy|1996|p=73}}; {{harvnb|Garthwaite|2005|p=77}}</ref> Ctesiphon may not have become the official capital until the reign of [[Gotarzes I of Parthia]] (''r''.

The Seleucids were unable to retaliate immediately as general [[Diodotus Tryphon]] led a rebellion at the capital [[Antioch]] in 142 BC.<ref>{{harvnb|Bivar|1983|p=34}}</ref> However, by 140&nbsp;BC [[Demetrius II Nicator]] was able to launch a counter-invasion against the Parthians in Mesopotamia. Despite early successes, the Seleucids were defeated and Demetrius himself was captured by Parthian forces and taken to Hyrcania. There Mithridates treated his captive with great hospitality; he even married his daughter [[Rhodogune of Parthia]] to Demetrius.<ref>{{harvnb|Brosius|2006|p=89}}; {{harvnb|Bivar|1983|p=35}}</ref>

[[Antiochus VII Sidetes]] (''r''.&nbsp;138<U+2013>129&nbsp;BC), a brother of Demetrius, assumed the Seleucid throne and married the latter's wife [[Cleopatra Thea]]. After defeating Diodotus Tryphon, Antiochus initiated a campaign in 130&nbsp;BC to retake Mesopotamia, now under the rule of [[Phraates II of Parthia]] (''r''.&nbsp;''c''.&nbsp;138<U+2013>128&nbsp;BC). The Parthian general Indates was defeated along the [[Great Zab]], followed by a local uprising where the Parthian governor of Babylonia was killed. Antiochus conquered Babylonia and occupied Susa, where he minted coins.<ref name="bivar_1983_36-37 curtis_2007_11">{{harvnb|Bivar|1983|pp=36<U+2013>37}}; {{harvnb|Curtis|2007|p=11}}</ref> After advancing his army into Media, the Parthians pushed for peace, which Antiochus refused to accept unless the Arsacids relinquished all lands to him except Parthia proper, paid heavy tribute, and released Demetrius from captivity.

While the Parthians regained the territories lost in the west, another threat arose in the east. In 177<U+2013>176&nbsp;BC the nomadic confederation of the [[Xiongnu]] dislodged the nomadic [[Yuezhi]] from their homelands in what is now [[Gansu]] province in [[Northwest China]];<ref>{{harvnb|Torday|1997|pp=80<U+2013>81}}</ref> the Yuezhi then migrated west into Bactria and displaced the [[Saka]] (Scythian) tribes.

Although at peace with Parthia, Rome still interfered in its affairs. The Roman emperor [[Tiberius]] (r.&nbsp;14<U+2013>37&nbsp;AD) became involved in a plot by [[Pharasmanes I of Iberia]] to place his brother [[Mithridates of Armenia|Mithridates]] on the throne of Armenia by assassinating the Parthian ally King Arsaces of Armenia.<ref>{{harvnb|Bivar|1983|p=73}}</ref> Artabanus II tried and failed to restore Parthian control of Armenia, prompting an aristocratic revolt that forced him to flee to [[Scythia]].

After the [[Caucasian Iberia|Iberian king]] Pharasmanes I had his son [[Rhadamistus]] (''r''.&nbsp;51<U+2013>55&nbsp;AD) invade Armenia to depose the Roman client king Mithridates, [[Vologeses I of Parthia]] (''r''.

When [[Vardanes II of Parthia]] rebelled against his father Vologeses I in 55&nbsp;AD, Vologeses withdrew his forces from Armenia.

Hostilities between Rome and Parthia were renewed when [[Osroes I of Parthia]] (''r''.

In the last months of 116&nbsp;AD, Trajan captured the Persian city of Susa. When [[Sanatruces II of Parthia]] gathered forces in eastern Parthia to challenge the Romans, his cousin [[Parthamaspates of Parthia]] betrayed and killed him: Trajan crowned him the new king of Parthia.<ref name="bivar_1983_90-91">{{harvnb|Bivar|1983|pp=90<U+2013>91}}</ref> Never again would the Roman Empire advance so far to the east.

During his campaign, Trajan was granted the title ''Parthicus'' by the Senate and coins were minted proclaiming the conquest of Parthia.<ref>{{harvnb|Bivar|1983|pp=90<U+2013>91}}; see also {{harvnb|Brosius|2006|p=137}} and {{harvnb|Curtis|2007|p=13}}</ref> However, only the 4th-century AD historians [[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]] and [[Festus (historian)|Festus]] allege that he attempted to establish a [[Mesopotamia (Roman province)|Roman province]] in lower Mesopotamia.<ref>{{harvnb|Lightfoot|1990|pp=120<U+2013>124}}</ref>

Trajan's successor [[Hadrian]] (''r''.&nbsp;117<U+2013>138&nbsp;AD) reaffirmed the [[Roman-Parthian Wars|Roman-Parthian]] border at the Euphrates, choosing not to invade Mesopotamia due to Rome's now limited military resources.<ref>{{harvnb|Brosius|2006|p=100}}; see also {{harvnb|Lightfoot|1990|p=115}}; {{harvnb|Garthwaite|2005|p=81}}; and {{harvnb|Bivar|1983|p=91}}</ref> Parthamaspates fled after the Parthians revolted against him, yet the Romans made him king of [[Osroene]].

Roman emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]] (''r''.&nbsp;161<U+2013>180&nbsp;AD) had co-ruler [[Lucius Verus]] (''r''.&nbsp;161<U+2013>169&nbsp;AD) guard Syria while [[Marcus Statius Priscus]] invaded Armenia in 163&nbsp;AD, followed by the invasion of Mesopotamia by [[Avidius Cassius]] in 164&nbsp;AD.<ref>{{harvnb|Bivar|1983|p=93}}</ref>

The Romans captured and burnt Seleucia and Ctesiphon to the ground, yet they were forced to retreat once the Roman soldiers contracted a [[Antonine Plague|deadly disease]] (possibly [[smallpox]]) that soon ravaged the Roman world.<ref>{{harvnb|Brosius|2006|p=100}}; {{harvnb|Bivar|1983|pp=93<U+2013>94}}</ref> Although they withdrew, from this point forward the city of Dura-Europos remained in Roman hands.<ref>{{harvnb|Curtis|2007|p=13}}; {{harvnb|Bivar|1983|pp=93<U+2013>94}}</ref>

When Roman emperor [[Septimius Severus]] (''r''.&nbsp;193<U+2013>211&nbsp;AD) invaded Mesopotamia in 197&nbsp;AD during the reign of [[Vologases V of Parthia]] (''r''. ''c''.&nbsp;191<U+2013>208&nbsp;AD), the Romans once again marched down the Euphrates and captured Seleucia and Ctesiphon. After assuming the title ''Parthicus Maximus'', he retreated in late 198&nbsp;AD, failing as Trajan once did to capture Hatra during a siege.<ref>{{harvnb|Brosius|2006|p=100}}; {{harvnb|Curtis|2007|p=13}}; {{harvnb|Bivar|1983|p=94}}; {{harvnb|Katouzian|2009|p=44}}</ref>

Around 212&nbsp;AD, soon after [[Vologases VI of Parthia]] (''r''. ''c''.&nbsp;208<U+2013>222&nbsp;AD) took the throne, his brother [[Artabanus V of Parthia]] (d.&nbsp;224&nbsp;AD) rebelled against him and gained control over a greater part of the empire.<ref name="bivar_1983_94-95">{{harvnb|Bivar|1983|pp=94<U+2013>95}}</ref> Meanwhile, the Roman emperor [[Caracalla]] (''r''.&nbsp;211<U+2013>217&nbsp;AD) deposed the kings of Osroene and Armenia to make them Roman provinces once more. He marched into Mesopotamia under the pretext of marrying one of Artabanus' daughters, but<U+2014>because the marriage was not allowed<U+2014>made war on Parthia and conquered [[Arbil]] east of the [[Tigris]] river.
[[File:Bas relief nagsh-e-rostam couronnement.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid]] relief at [[Naqsh-e Rustam]] showing the [[investiture]] of [[Ardashir I]]]]

Caracalla was assassinated the next year on the road to Carrhae by his soldiers.<ref name="bivar_1983_94-95"/> After this debacle, the Parthians made a settlement with [[Macrinus]] (''r''.&nbsp;217<U+2013>218) where the Romans paid Parthia over two-hundred million ''[[Denarius|denarii]]'' with additional gifts.<ref>{{harvnb|Brosius|2006|pp=100<U+2013>101}}; see also {{harvnb|Katouzian|2009|p=44}}, who mentions this in passing</ref>

But the Parthian Empire, weakened by internal strife and wars with Rome, was soon to be followed by the [[Sassanid Empire]]. Indeed shortly afterward, [[Ardashir I]], the local Iranian ruler of Persis (modern [[Fars Province]], Iran) from [[Estakhr]] began subjugating the surrounding territories in defiance of Arsacid rule.<ref name="brosius_2006_101 bivar_1983_95-96 curtis_2007_14 katouzian_2009_44">{{harvnb|Brosius|2006|p=101}}; {{harvnb|Bivar|1983|pp=95<U+2013>96}}; {{harvnb|Curtis|2007|p=14}}; see also {{harvnb|Katouzian|2009|p=44}}</ref> He confronted Artabanus V at the [[Battle of Hormozdg<U+0101>n]] on 28 April 224&nbsp;AD, perhaps at a site near [[Isfahan]], defeating him and establishing the Sassanid Empire.<ref name="brosius_2006_101 bivar_1983_95-96 curtis_2007_14 katouzian_2009_44"/> There is evidence, however, that suggests Volageses VI continued to mint coins at Seleucia as late as 228&nbsp;AD.<ref>{{harvnb|Bivar|1983|pp=95<U+2013>96}}</ref>

The Sasanians would not only assume Parthia's legacy as Rome's Persian nemesis, but they would also attempt to restore the boundaries of the Achaemenid Empire by [[Byzantine-Sassanid War of 602<U+2013>628|briefly conquering]] the Levant, Anatolia, and Egypt from the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] during the reign of [[Khosrau II]] (''r''.&nbsp;590<U+2013>628&nbsp;AD).<ref>{{harvnb|Frye|1983|pp=173<U+2013>174}}</ref> However, they would lose these territories to [[Heraclius]]<U+2014>the last Roman emperor before the [[Muslim conquests|Arab conquests]].

==Government and administration==

===Central authority and semi-autonomous kings===

Compared with the earlier Achaemenid Empire, the Parthian government was notably [[Decentralization|decentralized]].<ref>{{harvnb|Garthwaite|2005|pp=67<U+2013>68}}</ref> An indigenous historical source reveals that territories overseen by the central government were organized in a similar manner to the Seleucid Empire. They both had a threefold division for their provincial hierarchies: the Parthian marzb<U+0101>n, x<U+0161>atrap, and dizpat, similar to the Seleucid [[satrapy]], [[eparchy]], and hyparchy.<ref name="widengren_1983_1263">{{harvnb|Widengren|1983|p=1263}}</ref> The Parthian Empire also contained several subordinate semi-autonomous kingdoms, including the states of [[Caucasian Iberia]], [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Armenia]], [[Atropatene]], [[Gordyene]], [[Adiabene]], [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]], [[Hatra]], [[Mesene]], [[Elymais]], and [[Persis]].<ref name="lukonin_1983_701">{{harvnb|Lukonin|1983|p=701}}</ref> The state rulers governed their own territories and minted their own coinage distinct from the royal coinage produced at the imperial mints.<ref>{{harvnb|Lukonin|1983|p=701}}; {{harvnb|Curtis|2007|pp=19<U+2013>21}}</ref> This was not unlike the earlier Achaemenid Empire, which also had some city-states, and even distant satrapies who were semi-independent but "recognised the supremacy of the king, paid tribute and provided military support", according to Brosius.<ref>{{harvnb|Brosius|2006|pp=113<U+2013>114}}</ref> However, the satraps of Parthian times governed smaller territories, and perhaps had less prestige and influence than their Achaemenid predecessors.<ref>{{harvnb|Brosius|2006|pp=115<U+2013>116}}</ref> During the Seleucid period, the trend of local ruling dynasties with semi-autonomous rule, and sometimes outright rebellious rule, became commonplace, a fact reflected in the later Parthian style of governance.<ref>{{harvnb|Brosius|2006|pp=114<U+2013>115}}</ref>

===Nobility===

The King of Kings headed the Parthian government. He maintained [[polygamous]] relations, and was usually succeeded by his first-born son.<ref name="brosius_2006_103-104">{{harvnb|Brosius|2006|pp=103<U+2013>104}}</ref> Like the Ptolemies of Egypt, there is also record of Arsacid kings marrying their nieces and perhaps even half-sisters; Queen Musa married her own son, though this was an extreme and isolated case.<ref name="brosius_2006_103-104"/> Brosius provides an extract from a letter written in Greek by King Artabanus II in 21&nbsp;AD, which addresses the governor (titled "[[archon]]") and citizens of the city of [[Susa]]. Specific government offices of Preferred Friend, Bodyguard and Treasurer are mentioned and the document also proves that "while there were local jurisdictions and proceedings to appointment to high office, the king could intervene on behalf of an individual, review a case and amend the local ruling if he considered it appropriate."<ref>{{harvnb|Brosius|2006|p=119}}</ref>

The hereditary titles of the hierarchic nobility recorded during the reign of the first Sassanid monarch Ardashir I most likely reflect the titles already in use during the Parthian era.<ref>{{harvnb|Lukonin|1983|pp=699<U+2013>700}}</ref> There were three distinct tiers of nobility, the highest being the regional kings directly below the King of Kings, the second being those related to the King of Kings only through marriage, and the lowest order being heads of local clans and small territories.<ref>{{harvnb|Lukonin|1983|pp=700<U+2013>704}}</ref>

By the 1st century AD, the Parthian nobility had assumed great power and influence in the succession and deposition of Arsacid kings.<ref>{{harvnb|Brosius|2006|pp=99<U+2013>100, 104}}</ref> Some of the nobility functioned as court advisers to the king, as well as holy priests.<ref>{{harvnb|Brosius|2006|pp=104<U+2013>105, 117<U+2013>118}}</ref> Of the great noble Parthian clans listed at the beginning of the Sasanian period, only two are explicitly mentioned in earlier Parthian documents: the [[House of Suren]] and the [[House of Karen]].<ref>{{harvnb|Lukonin|1983|pp=704<U+2013>705}}</ref> The historian [[Plutarch]] noted that members of the Suren clan, the first among the nobility, were given the privilege of crowning each new Arsacid King of Kings during their coronations.<ref>{{harvnb|Lukonin|1983|p=704}}; {{harvnb|Brosius|2006|p=104}}</ref> Later on, some of the Parthian kings would claim Achaemenid descent. This has recently been corroborated via the possibility of an inherited disease ([[neurofibromatosis]]) demonstrated by the physical descriptions of rulers and from evidence of familial disease on ancient coinage.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Ashrafian, Hutan.|title=Limb gigantism, neurofibromatosis and royal heredity in the Ancient World 2500 years ago: Achaemenids and Parthians|journal= J Plast Reconstr Aesthet Surg|volume=64|year=2011|pages=557|doi= 10.1016/j.bjps.2010.08.025|url= http://www.jprasurg.com/article/S1748-6815(10)00521-8/pdf|pmid=20832372}}</ref>

===Military===
[[File:Zahhak castle stucco 2.JPG|thumb|A Parthian [[stucco]] relief of an infantryman, from the walls of [[Zahhak Castle]], [[East Azarbaijan Province]], Iran]]
The Parthian Empire had no [[standing army]], yet were able to quickly recruit troops in the event of local crises.<ref>{{harvnb|Brosius|2006|pp=116, 122}}; {{harvnb|Sheldon|2010|pp=231<U+2013>232}}</ref> There was a permanent armed guard attached to the person of the king, comprising nobles, [[serf]]s and [[mercenaries]], but this royal retinue was small.<ref name="kennedy_1996_84">{{harvnb|Kennedy|1996|p=84}}</ref> Garrisons were also permanently maintained at border forts; Parthian inscriptions reveal some of the military titles granted to the commanders of these locations.<ref name="kennedy_1996_84"/> Military forces could also be used in diplomatic gestures. For example, when Chinese envoys visited Parthia in the late 2nd century BC, the ''[[Shiji]]'' maintains that 20,000 horsemen were sent to the eastern borders to serve as escorts for the embassy, although this figure is perhaps an exaggeration.<ref>{{harvnb|Wang|2007|pp=99<U+2013>100}}</ref>

The main striking force of the Parthian army was its [[cataphract]]s, heavy cavalry with man and horse decked in [[Mail (armour)|mailed armor]].<ref name="brosius_2006_120 garthwaite_2005_78">{{harvnb|Brosius|2006|p=120}}; {{harvnb|Garthwaite|2005|p=78}}</ref> The cataphracts were equipped with a lance for charging into enemy lines,but were not equipped with bows and arrows which were restricted to horse archers.<ref>{{harvnb|Brosius|2006|p=120}}; {{harvnb|Kennedy|1996|p=84}}</ref> Due to the cost of their equipment and armor, cataphracts were recruited from among the aristocratic class who, in return for their services, demanded a measure of autonomy at the local level from the Arsacid kings.<ref>{{harvnb|Brosius|2006|pp=116<U+2013>118}}; see also {{harvnb|Garthwaite|2005|p=78}} and {{harvnb|Kennedy|1996|p=84}}</ref> The light cavalry was recruited from among the commoner class and acted as [[horse archer]]s; they wore a simple tunic and trousers into battle.<ref name="brosius_2006_120 garthwaite_2005_78"/> They used [[composite bow]]s and were able to shoot at enemies while riding and facing away from them; this technique, known as the [[Parthian shot]], was a highly effective tactic.<ref>{{harvnb|Brosius|2006|p=120}}; {{harvnb|Garthwaite|2005|p=78}}; {{harvnb|Kurz|1983|p=561}}</ref>
The heavy and light cavalry of Parthia proved to be a decisive factor in the [[Battle of Carrhae]] where a Persian force defeated a much larger Roman army under Crassus.
Light infantry units, composed of [[Conscription|levied commoners]] and mercenaries, were used to disperse enemy troops after cavalry charges.<ref>{{harvnb|Brosius|2006|p=122}}</ref>

The size of the Parthian army is unknown, as is the size of the empire's overall population. However, archaeological excavations in former Parthian urban centers reveal settlements which could have sustained large populations and hence a great resource in manpower.<ref name="kennedy_1996_83">{{harvnb|Kennedy|1996|p=83}}</ref> Dense population centers in regions like Babylonia were no doubt attractive to the Romans, whose armies could afford to live off the land.<ref name="kennedy_1996_83"/>

===Currency===
Usually made of silver,<ref>{{harvnb|Curtis|2007|pp=9, 11<U+2013>12, 16}}</ref> the [[Greek drachma]] coin, including the [[tetradrachm]], was the standard currency used throughout the Parthian Empire.<ref>{{harvnb|Curtis|2007|pp=7<U+2013>25}}; {{harvnb|Sellwood|1983|pp=279<U+2013>298}}</ref> The Arsacids maintained [[Mint (coin)|royal mints]] at the cities of Hecatompylos, Seleucia, and Ecbatana.<ref name="brosius_2006_103">{{harvnb|Brosius|2006|p=103}}</ref> They most likely operated a mint at Mithridatkert/Nisa as well.<ref name="curtis_2007_8"/> From the empire's inception until its collapse, drachmas produced throughout the Parthian period rarely weighed less than 3.5&nbsp;g or more than 4.2&nbsp;g.<ref>{{harvnb|Sellwood|1983|p=280}}</ref> The first Parthian tetradrachms, weighing in principle around 16&nbsp;g with some variation, appear after Mithridates I conquered Mesopotamia and were minted exclusively at Seleucia.<ref>{{harvnb|Sellwood|1983|p=282}}</ref>

==Society and culture==

===Hellenism and the Iranian revival===
[[Image:ParthianHorseman.jpg|thumb|left|Parthian horseman, now on display at the [[Palazzo Madama, Turin]].]]

Although [[Culture of Greece|Greek culture]] of the Seleucids was widely adopted by peoples of the [[Near East]] during the [[Hellenistic period]], the Parthian era witnessed an [[Culture of Iran|Iranian cultural revival]] in religion, the arts, and even clothing fashions.<ref>{{harvnb|Curtis|2007|pp=14<U+2013>15}}; see also {{harvnb|Katouzian|2009|p=45}}</ref> Conscious of both the Hellenistic and Persian cultural roots of their kingship, the Arsacid rulers styled themselves after the Persian King of Kings and affirmed that they were also ''[[Philhellenism|philhellenes]]'' ("friends of the Greeks").<ref>{{harvnb|Garthwaite|2005|p=85}}; {{harvnb|Curtis|2007|pp=14<U+2013>15}}</ref> The word "philhellene" was inscribed on Parthian coins until the reign of Artabanus II.<ref name="curtis_2007_11">{{harvnb|Curtis|2007|p=11}}</ref> The discontinuation of this phrase signified the revival of Iranian culture in Parthia.<ref name="curtis_2007_16">{{harvnb|Curtis|2007|p=16}}</ref> Vologases I was the first Arsacid ruler to have the [[Pahlavi script|Parthian script]] and [[Parthian language|language]] appear on his minted coins alongside the now almost illegible Greek.<ref>{{harvnb|Garthwaite|2005|pp=80<U+2013>81}}; see also {{harvnb|Curtis|2007|p=21}} and {{harvnb|Schlumberger|1983|p=1030}}</ref> However, the use of Greek-alphabet legends on Parthian coins remained until the collapse of the empire.<ref>{{harvnb|Schlumberger|1983|p=1030}}</ref>

[[File:ParthianWaterSpoutWithFaceOfIranianMan1-2ndCenturyCE.jpg|thumb|A ceramic Parthian water spout in the shape of a man's head, dated 1st or 2nd century AD]]
Greek cultural influence did not disappear from the Parthian Empire, however, and there is evidence that the Arsacids enjoyed [[Theatre of ancient Greece|Greek theatre]]. When the head of Crassus was brought to Orodes II, he, alongside Armenian king Artavasdes II, were busy watching a performance of ''[[The Bacchae]]'' by the playwright [[Euripides]] (''c''.&nbsp;480<U+2013>406 BC). The producer of the play decided to use Crassus' actual severed head in place of the [[Theatrical property|stage-prop]] head of [[Pentheus]].<ref>{{harvnb|Bivar|1983|p=56}}</ref>

On his coins, Arsaces I is depicted in apparel similar to Achaemenid satraps. According to A. Shahbazi, Arsaces "deliberately diverges from Seleucid coins to emphasize his nationalistic and royal aspirations, and he calls himself K<U+0101>rny/Karny (Greek: Autocratos), a title already borne by Achaemenid supreme generals, such as Cyrus the Younger."<ref name=shahbazi525/> In line with Achaemenid traditions, rock-relief images of Arsacid rulers were carved at [[Mount Behistun]], where [[Darius I of Persia]] (r. 522<U+2013>486 BC) made [[Behistun Inscription|royal inscriptions]].<ref>{{harvnb|Garthwaite|2005|p=85}}; {{harvnb|Brosius|2006|pp=128<U+2013>129}}</ref> Moreover, the Arsacids claimed familial descent from [[Artaxerxes II of Persia]] (''r''.&nbsp;404<U+2013>358 BC) as a means to bolster their legitimacy in ruling over former Achaemenid territories, i.e. as being "legitimate successors of glorious kings" of ancient Iran.<ref>{{harvnb|Lukonin|1983|p=697}}</ref> [[Artabanus III]] named one of his sons Darius and laid claim to [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]]' heritage.<ref name=shahbazi525>{{harvnb|Shahbazi|1987|p=525}}</ref> The Arsacid kings chose typical Zoroastrian names for themselves and some from the "[[Kayanian dynasty|heroic background]]" of the [[Avesta]], according to V.G. Lukonin.<ref>{{harvnb|Lukonin|1983|p=687}}; {{harvnb|Shahbazi|1987|p=525}}</ref> The Parthians also adopted the use of the [[Babylonian calendar]] with names from the Achaemenid [[Iranian calendar]], replacing the [[Ancient Macedonian calendar|Macedonian calendar]] of the Seleucids.<ref>{{harvnb|Duchesne-Guillemin|1983|pp=867<U+2013>868}}</ref>

===Religion===
[[File:ParthianVotiveReliefIranKhuzestan2ndCenturyCE.jpg|thumb|Parthian votive relief from Kh<U+016B>zest<U+0101>n Province, Iran, 2nd century AD]]
The Parthian Empire, being culturally and politically heterogeneous, had a variety of religious systems and beliefs, the most widespread being those dedicated to [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Persian mythology|Iranian]] cults.<ref name="katouzian_2009_45">{{harvnb|Katouzian|2009|p=45}}</ref> Aside from a minority of [[Judaism|Jews]]<ref>{{harvnb|Neusner|1983|pp=909<U+2013>923}}</ref> and early [[Christianity|Christians]],<ref>{{harvnb|Asmussen|1983|pp=924<U+2013>928}}</ref> most Parthians were [[polytheistic]].<ref name="brosius_2006_125">{{harvnb|Brosius|2006|p=125}}</ref> Greek and Iranian deities were often blended together as one. For example, [[Zeus]] was often equated with [[Ahura Mazda]], [[Hades]] with [[Angra Mainyu]], [[Aphrodite]] and [[Hera]] with [[Anahita]], [[Apollo]] with [[Mithra]], and [[Hermes]] with [[Shamash]].<ref>{{harvnb|Garthwaite|2005|pp=68, 83<U+2013>84}}; {{harvnb|Colpe|1983|p=823}}; {{harvnb|Brosius|2006|p=125}}</ref> Aside from the main gods and goddesses, each ethnic group and city had their own designated deities.<ref name="brosius_2006_125"/> As with Seleucid rulers,<ref>{{harvnb|Duchesne-Guillemin|1983|pp=872<U+2013>873}}</ref> Parthian art indicates that the Arsacid kings viewed themselves as gods; this [[Imperial cult|cult of the ruler]] was perhaps the most widespread.<ref>{{harvnb|Colpe|1983|p=844}}</ref>

The extent of Arsacid patronism of [[Zoroastrianism]] is debated in modern scholarship.<ref>{{harvnb|Katouzian|2009|p=45}}; {{harvnb|Brosius|2006|pp=102<U+2013>103}}</ref> The followers of [[Zoroaster]] would have found the bloody sacrifices of some Parthian-era Iranian cults to be unacceptable.<ref name="katouzian_2009_45"/> However, there is evidence that Vologeses I encouraged the presence of Zoroastrian [[magi]] priests at court and sponsored the compilation of sacred Zoroastrian texts which later formed the [[Avesta]].<ref>{{harvnb|Bivar|1983|pp=85<U+2013>86}}; {{harvnb|Garthwaite|2005|pp=80<U+2013>81}}; {{harvnb|Duchesne-Guillemin|1983|p=867}}</ref> The Sassanid court would later adopt Zoroastrianism as the official state religion of the empire.<ref>{{harvnb|Garthwaite|2005|p=67}}; {{harvnb|Asmussen|1983|pp=928, 933<U+2013>934}}</ref>

Although [[Mani (prophet)|Mani]] (216<U+2013>276 AD), the founding prophet of [[Manichaeism]], did not proclaim his first religious revelation until 228/229 AD, Bivar asserts that his new faith contained "elements of [[Mandaeism|Mandaean]] belief, Iranian cosmogony, and even echoes of Christianity&nbsp;... [it] may be regarded as a typical reflection of the mixed religious doctrines of the late Arsacid period, which the Zoroastrian orthodoxy of the Sasanians was soon to sweep away."<ref>{{harvnb|Bivar|1983|p=97}}</ref>

There is scant archaeological evidence for the spread of [[Buddhism]] from the [[Kushan Empire]] into Iran proper.<ref>{{harvnb|Emmerick|1983|p=957}}</ref> However, it is known from Chinese sources that [[An Shigao]] (fl. 2nd century AD), a Parthian nobleman and Buddhist monk, traveled to [[Luoyang]] in Han China as a [[Silk Road transmission of Buddhism|Buddhist missionary]] and translated several [[Buddhist texts|Buddhist canons]] into [[Chinese language|Chinese]].<ref>{{harvnb|Demi<U+00E9>ville|1986|p=823}}; {{harvnb|Zhang|2002|p=75}}</ref>

===Art and architecture===
{{further|Parthian art}}

[[File:Hatra (17).jpg|thumb|A [[barrel vault]]ed ''[[iwan]]'' at the entrance at the ancient site of [[Hatra]], modern-day [[Iraq]], built ''c''.&nbsp;50 AD]]

Parthian art can be divided into three geo-historical phases: the art of Parthia proper; the art of the [[Iranian plateau]]; and the art of Parthian Mesopotamia.<ref name="brosius_2006_127">{{harvnb|Brosius|2006|p=127}}</ref> The first genuine Parthian art, found at Mithridatkert/Nisa, combined elements of Greek and Iranian art in line with Achaemenid and Seleucid traditions.<ref name="brosius_2006_127"/> In the second phase, Parthian art found inspiration in [[Achaemenid art#Art and architecture|Achaemenid art]], as exemplified by the investiture relief of Mithridates II at Mount Behistun.<ref name="brosius_2006_128"/> The third phase occurred gradually after the Parthian conquest of Mesopotamia.<ref name="brosius_2006_128"/>

Common [[Motif (visual arts)|motifs]] of the Parthian period include scenes of royal hunting expeditions and the [[investiture]] of Arsacid kings.<ref>{{harvnb|Brosius|2006|p=127}}; see also {{harvnb|Schlumberger|1983|pp=1041<U+2013>1043}}</ref> Use of these motifs extended to include portrayals of local rulers.<ref name="brosius_2006_127"/> Common art mediums were rock-reliefs, [[fresco]]s, and even [[graffiti]].<ref name="brosius_2006_127"/> Geometric and stylized plant patterns were also used on [[stucco]] and [[plaster]] walls.<ref name="brosius_2006_128"/> The common motif of the Sassanid period showing two horsemen engaged in combat with lances first appeared in the Parthian reliefs at Mount Behistun.<ref>{{harvnb|Brosius|2006|pp=129, 132}}</ref>

In [[portrait]]ure the Parthians favored and emphasized frontality, meaning the person depicted by painting, sculpture, or raised-relief on coins faced the viewer directly instead of showing his or her profile.<ref>{{harvnb|Brosius|2006|p=127}}; {{harvnb|Garthwaite|2005|p=84}}; {{harvnb|Schlumberger|1983|pp=1049<U+2013>1050}}</ref> Although frontality in portraiture was already an old artistic technique by the Parthian period, [[Daniel Schlumberger]] explains the innovation of Parthian frontality:<ref name="schlumberger_1983_1051"/>

<blockquote>'Parthian frontality', as we are now accustomed to call it, deeply differs both from ancient Near Eastern and from Greek frontality, though it is, no doubt, an offspring of the latter. For both in Oriental art and in Greek art, frontality was an exceptional treatment: in Oriental art it was a treatment strictly reserved for a small number of traditional characters of cult and myth; in Greek art it was an option resorted to only for definite reasons, when demanded by the subject, and, on the whole, seldom made use of. With Parthian art, on the contrary, frontality becomes the normal treatment of the figure. For the Parthians frontality is really nothing but the habit of showing, in relief and in painting, all figures full-face, even at the expense (as it seems to us moderns) of clearness and intelligibility. So systematic is this use that it amounts to a complete banishment ''de facto'' of the side-view and of all intermediate attitudes. This singular state of things seems to have become established in the course of the 1st century A.D.<ref name="schlumberger_1983_1051">{{harvnb|Schlumberger|1983|p=1051}}</ref></blockquote>

Parthian art, with its distinct use of frontality in portraiture, was lost and abandoned with the profound cultural and political changes brought by the Sassanid Empire.<ref>{{harvnb|Schlumberger|1983|p=1053}}</ref> However, even after the Roman occupation of Dura-Europos in 165 AD, the use of Parthian frontality in portraiture continued to flourish there. This is exemplified by the early 3rd-century AD wall murals of the [[Dura-Europos synagogue]], a temple in the same city dedicated to Palmyrene gods, and the local [[Mithraeum]].<ref>{{harvnb|Curtis|2007|p=18}}; {{harvnb|Schlumberger|1983|pp=1052<U+2013>1053}}</ref>

Parthian architecture adopted elements of [[Iranian architecture|Achaemenid]] and [[Architecture of ancient Greece|Greek architecture]], but remained distinct from the two. The style is first attested at Mithridatkert/Nisa.<ref name="brosius_2006_111-112">{{harvnb|Brosius|2006|pp=111<U+2013>112}}</ref> The Round Hall of Nisa is similar to Hellenistic palaces, but different in that it forms a circle and [[Vault (architecture)|vault]] inside a square space.<ref name="brosius_2006_111-112"/> However, the artwork of Nisa, including marble statues and the carved scenes on ivory [[rhyton]] vessels, is unquestionably influenced by Greek art.<ref>{{harvnb|Brosius|2006|pp=111<U+2013>112, 127<U+2013>128}}; {{harvnb|Schlumberger|1983|pp=1037<U+2013>1041}}</ref>

A signature feature of Parthian architecture was the ''[[iwan]]'', an audience hall supported by arches and/or [[barrel vault]]s and open on one side.<ref name="garthwaite_2005_84 brosius_2006_128 schlumberger_1983_1049">{{harvnb|Garthwaite|2005|p=84}}; {{harvnb|Brosius|2006|p=128}}; {{harvnb|Schlumberger|1983|p=1049}}</ref> Use of the barrel vault replaced the Hellenic use of columns to support roofs.<ref name="brosius_2006_128">{{harvnb|Brosius|2006|p=128}}</ref> Although the ''iwan'' was known during the Achaemenid period and earlier in smaller and subterranean structures, it was the Parthians who first built them on a monumental scale.<ref name="garthwaite_2005_84 brosius_2006_128 schlumberger_1983_1049"/> The earliest Parthian ''iwans'' are found at Seleucia, built in the early 1st century AD.<ref name="brosius_2006_128"/> Monumental ''iwans'' are also commonly found in the ancient temples of Hatra and perhaps modeled on the Parthian style.<ref name="brosius_2006_134-135">{{harvnb|Brosius|2006|pp=134<U+2013>135}}</ref> The largest Parthian ''iwans'' at that site have a span of 15&nbsp;m (50&nbsp;ft).<ref>{{harvnb|Schlumberger|1983|p=1049}}</ref>

===Clothing and apparel===
[[File:YoungManWithParthianCostume.jpg|thumb|upright|A statue of a young Palmyran in fine Parthian trousers, from a funerary [[stele]] at [[Palmyra]], early 3rd century AD]]

The typical Parthian riding outfit is exemplified by [[Statue, National Museum of Iran 2401|the famous bronze statue]] of a Parthian nobleman found at Shami, Elymais. Standing 1.9&nbsp;m (6&nbsp;ft), the figure wears a V-shaped jacket, a V-shaped [[tunic]] fastened in place with a belt, loose-fitting and many-folded trousers held by garters, and a diadem or band over his coiffed, bobbed hair.<ref>{{harvnb|Brosius|2006|pp=132<U+2013>134}}</ref> His outfit is commonly seen in relief images of Parthian coins by the mid-1st century BC.<ref name="curtis_2007_16"/>

Examples of clothing in Parthian inspired sculptures have been found in excavations at Hatra, in northwestern Iraq. Statues erected there feature the typical Parthian shirt (''qamis''), combined with trousers and made with fine, ornamented materials.<ref>{{harvnb|Bivar|1983|pp=91<U+2013>92}}</ref> The aristocratic elite of Hatra adopted the bobbed hairstyles, headdresses, and belted tunics worn by the nobility belonging to the central Arsacid court.<ref name="brosius_2006_134-135"/> The trouser-suit was even worn by the Arsacid kings, as shown on the reverse images of coins.<ref>{{harvnb|Curtis|2007|p=15}}</ref> The Parthian trouser-suit was also adopted in [[Palmyra]], Syria, along with the use of Parthian frontality in art.<ref>{{harvnb|Curtis|2007|p=17}}</ref>

Parthian sculptures depict wealthy women wearing long-sleeved robes over a dress, with necklaces, earrings, bracelets, and headdresses bedecked in jewelry.<ref>{{harvnb|Brosius|2006|pp=108, 134<U+2013>135}}</ref> Their many-folded dresses were fastened by a [[brooch]] at one shoulder.<ref name="brosius_2006_134-135"/> Their headdresses also featured a veil which was draped backwards.<ref name="brosius_2006_134-135"/>

As seen in Parthian coinage, the headdresses worn by the Parthian kings changed over time. The earliest Arsacid coins show rulers wearing the soft cap with cheek flaps, known as the [[bashlyk]] (Greek: ''kyrbasia'').<ref name="brosius_2006_101">{{harvnb|Brosius|2006|p=101}}</ref> This may have derived from an Achaemenid-era satrapal headdress and the [[pointy hat]]s depicted in the Achaemenid reliefs at Behistun and [[Persepolis]].<ref>{{harvnb|Curtis|2007|p=8}}; see also {{harvnb|Sellwood|1983|pp=279<U+2013>280}} for comparison with Achaemenid satrapal headdresses</ref> The earliest coins of Mithridates I show him wearing the soft cap, yet coins from the latter part of his reign show him for the first time wearing the royal Hellenistic diadem.<ref>{{harvnb|Brosius|2006|pp=101<U+2013>102}}; {{harvnb|Curtis|2007|p=9}}</ref> Mithridates II was the first to be shown wearing the Parthian [[tiara]], embroidered with pearls and jewels, a headdress commonly worn in the late Parthian period and by Sassanid monarchs.<ref>{{harvnb|Brosius|2006|pp=101<U+2013>102}}; {{harvnb|Curtis|2007|p=15}}</ref>

===Writing and literature===
It is known that during the Parthian period the court [[minstrel]] (''g<U+014D>s<U+0101>n'') recited poetic [[oral literature]] accompanied by music. However, their stories, composed in verse form, were not written down until the subsequent Sasanian period.<ref>{{harvnb|Brosius|2006|p=106}}</ref> In fact, there is no known Parthian-language literature that survives in original form, since it was written down in the following centuries.<ref>{{harvnb|Boyce|1983|p=1151}}</ref> It is believed that such stories as the romantic tale ''[[Vis and R<U+0101>min]]'' and [[Epic poetry|epic cycle]] of the [[Kayanian dynasty]] were part of the corpus of oral literature from Parthian times, although compiled much later.<ref>{{harvnb|Boyce|1983|pp=1158<U+2013>1159}}</ref> Although literature of the Parthian language was not committed to written form, there is evidence that the Arsacids acknowledged and respected written [[Ancient Greek literature|Greek literature]].<ref>{{harvnb|Boyce|1983|pp=1154<U+2013>1155}}; see also {{harvnb|Kennedy|1996|p=74}}</ref>
