==Player of the Year Award==
Card Player is also well known for its ''Player of the Year Award''.   Started in 1997, it goes to the player who has the most outstanding tournament results throughout the year.  Players are awarded points for final-table finishes in major tournaments.  Points that can be earned in a given tournament are adjusted based on the [[Buying in (poker)|buy-in]], as well as the number of entrants.  The player who has accumulated the most points at the end of the year receives the prestigious award.
