'''Tropical Depression Two-E''' in 2006 was a short-lived [[tropical cyclone]] that brought heavy rainfall to southwestern Mexico. It was the only cyclone during the month in the eastern North [[Pacific Ocean]], forming on June&nbsp;3 from a [[tropical wave]]. The depression initially moved northeastward, threatening the Mexican states of [[Michoac<U+00E1>n]] and [[Guerrero]] with a potential of it attaining tropical storm status. It remained a tropical depression, weakening due to land interaction and [[wind shear]], and on June&nbsp;5 it dissipated just off the coast. Rainfall from the depression peaked at 19.1&nbsp;[[inch|inches]] (486&nbsp;[[millimetre|mm]]) in [[Acapulco]], which resulted in mudslides and flooding. A total of 42&nbsp;houses were flooded, and 72&nbsp;people were forced to leave their homes due to the storm; no deaths were reported.

==Meteorological history==
{{storm path|Two-E 2006 track.png}}
The tropical depression originated from a [[tropical wave]] off the southern coast of Mexico in late May&nbsp;2006. An area of [[convection (meteorology)|convection]] was associated with the wave, and forecasters at the [[National Hurricane Center]] (NHC) remarked that environmental conditions favored gradual [[tropical cyclogenesis|development]].<ref>{{cite web|author=James Franklin|date=2006-05-31|title=Tropical Weather Outlook|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-11-29|url=ftp://ftp.met.fsu.edu/pub/weather/tropical/Outlook-P/2006053116.ABPZ20}}</ref> The system, which was enhanced by the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]] (ITCZ), drifted northward with an [[anticyclone]] to its east and west.<ref>{{cite web|author=Martin Nelson|date=2006-06-01|title=Tropical Weather Discussion|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-11-29|url=ftp://ftp.met.fsu.edu/pub/weather/tropical/Pac-Dis/2006060103.AXPZ20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Jack Beven|date=2006-06-01|title=Tropical Weather Outlook|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-11-29|url=ftp://ftp.met.fsu.edu/pub/weather/tropical/Outlook-P/2006060104.ABPZ20}}</ref> On June&nbsp;1, the convection became more concentrated,<ref>{{cite web|author=Lixion Avila|date=2006-06-01|title=Tropical Weather Outlook (2)|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-11-29|url=ftp://ftp.met.fsu.edu/pub/weather/tropical/Outlook-P/2006060116.ABPZ20}}</ref> and by early the next day it developed a [[low pressure area]]; by that time, it began a steady northwestward track.<ref name="twd62"/>

Upon being classified as a tropical cyclone, the depression was in an area not favorable for significant strengthening, due to land interaction and wind shear.<ref name="disc1"/> It was tracking steadily northeastward, and as it moved closer to the coastline, the center of the depression was difficult to locate. However, the overall organization briefly improved, and in one forecast the depression was predicted to attain tropical storm status.<ref>{{cite web|author=Lixion Avila|date=2006-06-03|title=Tropical Depression Two-E Discussion Two|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2006/ep02/ep022006.discus.002.shtml?}}</ref> Early on June&nbsp;4, convection weakened significantly, leaving the center partially exposed.<ref>{{cite web|author=Mainelli/Beven|date=2006-06-04|title=Tropical Depression Two-E Discussion Three|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2006/ep02/ep022006.discus.003.shtml?}}</ref> Continued wind shear brought most of the associated thunderstorm activity onshore southwestern Mexico while the center of the depression remained just offshore.<ref>{{cite web|author=James Franklin|date=2006-06-04|title=Tropical Depression Two-E Discussion Four|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2006/ep02/ep022006.discus.004.shtml?}}</ref> Late on June&nbsp;4, the circulation accelerated away from the deep convection as it passed a short distance south of Acapulco.<ref>{{cite web|author=Stacy Stewart|date=2006-06-04|title=Tropical Depression Two-E Discussion Six|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2006/ep02/ep022006.discus.006.shtml?}}</ref> Early on June&nbsp;5, the circulation dissipated,<ref name="tcr">{{cite web|author=Lixion Avila|date=2006-07-05|title=Tropical Depression Two-E Tropical Cyclone Report|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/pdf/TCR-EP022006_Two-E.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref> and later that night the remnants moved inland.<ref>{{cite web|author=Wally Barnes|date=2006-06-05|title=Tropical Weather Discussion|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-11-29|url=ftp://ftp.met.fsu.edu/pub/weather/tropical/Pac-Dis/2006060516.AXPZ20}}</ref>

Due to uncertainty in whether the depression would attain tropical storm status or not,<ref name="tcr"/> the government of [[Mexico]] issued a [[tropical cyclone warnings and watches|tropical storm warning]] from Punta San Telmo, [[Michoac<U+00E1>n]] to [[Acapulco]], [[Guerrero]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Lixion Avila|date=2006-06-03|title=Tropical Depression Two-E Public Advisory Two|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2006/ep02/ep022006.public.002.shtml?}}</ref> Prior to affecting the coastline, the [[Servicio Meteorol<U+00F3>gico Nacional|Mexican meteorological agency]] issued a heavy rainfall advisory, also mentioning the potential for flooding and mudslides, for the [[Political divisions of Mexico|states]] of [[Jalisco]], [[Colima]], Michoac<U+00E1>n, Guerrero, and [[Oaxaca]].<ref name="smn">{{cite web|author=Alberto Hern<U+00E1>ndez Unz<U+00F3>n and Cirilo Bravo Lujano|year=2006|title=Resumen de la Depresi<U+00F3>n Tropical 2E del Oc<U+00E9>ano Pacifico|publisher=Servicio Meteorol<U+00F3>gico Nacional|language=Spanish|accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://smn.cna.gob.mx/ciclones/tempo2006/pacifico/dt2/dt2e.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref> Officials prepared 21&nbsp;shelters in the region.<ref name="65g"/>

The depression produced heavy rainfall along the coastline, including a total of 19.1&nbsp;[[inch|inches]] (486&nbsp;[[millimetre|mm]]) measured in a 48&nbsp;hour period in Acapulco.
