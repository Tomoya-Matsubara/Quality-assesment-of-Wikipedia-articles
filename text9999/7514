'''''Abdul Kadir''''' was an [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[pre-dreadnought battleship]] laid down in 1892. After she was framed, near the turn of the century, very little work was done to her other than to plate in the area near the [[keel]] before work ceased. When work was scheduled to resume in 1904, the keel blocks had shifted and rendered her a total loss. She was scrapped in the slipway in 1914, near the start of World War 1. She was to have a main armament of {{convert|283|mm|in|0|adj=on|sp=us}} guns. Those and all lower armaments were in  six inch barbettes.
==Design==
The ''Abdul Kadir'' was one of the Ottoman Navy's first pre-dreadnoughts, along with the [[Ottoman battleship Mesudiye]], although the latter was defined as an armoured frigate by the Ottoman Navy.<ref name=con309>Conways, pg 309</ref><ref name="class">{{cite web|url=http://navalhistory.flixco.info/H/297241x66654/8330/a0.htm|title=Ship Class: TUR Abdul Kadir|publisher=Naval History, Flixco Pty Limited.|accessdate=24 May 2010}}</ref>   She was to have displaced {{convert|8100|LT|t|0|lk=on}}, been {{convert|340|ft|m|abbr=on}} long, have a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|65|ft|m|abbr=on}} and a [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|23|ft|6|in|m|abbr=on}}.<ref name=con309/><ref name=class/> Along with ''Mesudiye'', she would have been one of the largest ships in the Ottoman Navy.<ref name=state>{{cite journal|last=Keltie|first=Scott|year=1902|title=The Statesman's Yearbook|publisher=The Macmillian Company|location=London|volume=39|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=8_G23X69hdMC&pg=PA1146&lpg=PA1146&dq=ottoman+battleship+abul+kadir&source=bl&ots=Yw9P8CQCBe&sig=6_OUupAm1pMqVff8K1NAnv4i6bc&hl=en&ei=fZb6S-SMB5DOMozOnIQI&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=8&ved=0CDMQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&q=abdul%20kader&f=false|accessdate=24 May 2010}}</ref>
===Propulsion===
The ''Abdul Kadir'' was to have been propelled by an unknwon number of boilers, presumably four,<ref name=con309/> rated at an estimated {{convert|12000|ihp|0|abbr=on}}, which, when propelling two [[Horsepower#shaft horsepower|shafts]], was estimated to move the ship at a speed of {{convert|18|kn|mph km/h|lk=on}}.<ref name=con309/>
===Armament===
As the ''Abdul Kadir''s was a [[barbette ship]], her primary armament of four {{convert|283|mm|in|0|adj=on|sp=us}} guns were planned to be in two twin [[barbette]]s on the centerline.<ref name=class/><ref name=con309/> This was augmented by a secondary battery of six {{convert|150|mm|in|0|adj=on|sp=us}} in signle barbette turrets on the wings of the ship.<ref name=con309/><ref name=class/> The ship's tertiary armament was eight {{convert|87|mm|in|0|adj=on|sp=us}} and eight {{convert|37|mm|in|0|adj=on|sp=us}} in single barbettes.<ref name=con309/><ref name=class/>The ''Abdul Kadir'' was also equuipped with six adjustable {{convert|14|in|mm|0|adj=on}} [[torpedo tube]]s on the wings of the ship.<ref name=con309/>
===Armour===
As a barbette ship, the ''Abdul Kadir'' had an armour of {{convert|6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} on the barbettes and {{convert|6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} for her [[belt armour]], which was the armour around the waterline of the ship.<ref name=con309/> Her [[Deck (ship)|deck]] was {{convert|2.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} thick and her [[Bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]]s inside the ship were {{convert|4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} thick.<ref name=con309/>
==Construction==
The ''Abdul Kadir'' was layed down in 1892 at the Constantinople Dockyard.<ref name=class/> When the ship was close to launching, progress on her was slowed down at around the turn of the century, with only the belt armour being layed onto the ship in the next four years. After work returned to the ship in full force in 1904, it was discovered that the keel blocks, blocks designed to keep the hull of a ship stable and at an even level, had moved, which rendered the ship a total loss.<ref name=con309/> She was scrapped on the slipway in 1914, near the outbreak of [[World War 1]].<ref name=con309/><ref name=class/>
