'''Patricia Highsmith''' (January 19, 1921 <U+2013> February 4, 1995) was an [[United States|American]] novelist and short-story writer most widely known for her [[psychological thrillers]], which led to more than two dozen film adaptations. Her first novel, ''[[Strangers on a Train (novel)|Strangers on a Train]]'', has been adapted for stage and screen numerous times, notably by [[Alfred Hitchcock]] in 1951. In addition to her acclaimed series about murderer [[Tom Ripley]], she wrote many [[short story|short stories]], often macabre, [[satire|satirical]] or tinged with [[black comedy|black humor]]. Although she wrote specifically in the genre of crime fiction, her books have been lauded by various writers and critics as being artistic and thoughtful enough to rival mainstream literature. [[Michael Dirda]] observed, "Europeans honored her as a psychological novelist, part of an [[existentialist]] tradition represented by her own favorite writers, in particular [[Fyodor Dostoevsky|Dostoevsky]], [[Joseph Conrad|Conrad]], [[Franz Kafka|Kafka]], [[Andre Gide|Gide]], and [[Albert Camus|Camus]]."<ref>[http://www.nybooks.com/articles/22797 "This Woman Is Dangerous"] ''The New York Review of Books''. July 2, 2009. Accessed November 15, 2009.</ref>

==Early life==
Highsmith was born '''Mary Patricia Plangman''' in  [[Fort Worth, Texas]], the only child of artists Jay Bernard Plangman (died 1975) and his wife, the former Mary Coates (1895<U+2013>March 12, 1991); the couple divorced ten days before their daughter's birth.<ref name="Schenkar">Joan Schenkar, "The Misfit and Her Muses", ''Wall Street Journal'', December 8, 2009, p. A19</ref> She was born in her maternal grandmother's boarding house. In 1927, Highsmith, her mother and her adoptive stepfather, artist Stanley Highsmith (whom her mother had married in 1924), moved to [[New York City]].<ref name="Schenkar"/> When she was 12 years old, she was taken to Fort Worth and lived with her grandmother for a year. She called this the "saddest year" of her life and felt abandoned by her mother. She returned to New York to continue living with her mother and stepfather, primarily in [[Manhattan]], but she also lived in [[Astoria, New York|Astoria, Queens]]. Pat Highsmith had an intense, complicated relationship with her mother and largely resented her stepfather. According to Highsmith, her mother once told her that she had tried to [[abortion|abort]] her by drinking [[turpentine]], although a biography of Highsmith indicates Jay Plangman tried to persuade his wife to have an abortion, but she refused.<ref>''The Talented Miss Highsmith: The Secret Life and Serious Art of Patricia Highsmith'', by Joan Schenkar, 2009; ISBN# 978-0-312-30375-4</ref> Highsmith never resolved this [[love-hate relationship]], which haunted her for the rest of her life, and which she fictionalized in her [[short story]] "[[The Terrapin]]", about a young boy who stabs his mother to death. Highsmith's mother predeceased her by only four years, dying at the age of 95.

Highsmith's grandmother taught her to read at an early age, and Highsmith made good use of her grandmother's extensive library. At the age of eight, she discovered [[Karl Menninger]]'s ''The Human Mind'' and was fascinated by the case studies of patients afflicted with [[mental disorder]]s such as [[pyromania]] and [[schizophrenia]].

==Comic books==
In 1942, Highsmith graduated from [[Barnard College]], where she had studied [[English composition]], playwriting and the short story. Living in [[New York City]] and [[Mexico]] between 1942 and 1948, she wrote for comic book publishers. Answering an ad for "reporter/rewrite," she arrived at the office of comic book publisher [[Ned Pines]] and landed a job working in a bullpen with four artists and three other writers. Initially scripting two comic book stories a day for $55-a-week paychecks, she soon realized she could make more money by writing freelance for comics, a situation which enabled her to find time to work on her own short stories and also live for a period in Mexico. The comic book scriptwriter job was the only long-term job she ever held.<ref name="Schenkar"/>

With Nedor/Standard/Pines (1942<U+2013>43), she wrote Sgt. Bill King stories and contributed to ''[[Black Terror]]''. For ''Real Fact'', ''Real Heroes'' and ''True Comics'', she wrote comic book profiles of [[Einstein]], [[Galileo]], [[Barney Ross]], [[Edward Rickenbacker]], [[Oliver Cromwell]], [[Sir Isaac Newton]], [[David Livingstone]] and others. In 1943<U+2013>45, she wrote for [[Fawcett Publications]], scripting for such [[Fawcett Comics]] characters as the [[Golden Arrow (comics)|Golden Arrow]], [[Spy Smasher]], [[Captain Midnight]], Crisco and Jasper. She wrote for Western Comics in 1945<U+2013>47. 

When she wrote ''[[The Talented Mr. Ripley]]'' (1955), one of the title character's first scam victims is comic book artist Frederick Reddington, a parting gesture directed at the earlier career she had abandoned: "Tom had a hunch about Reddington. He was a comic-book artist. He probably didn't know whether he was coming or going."<ref>Highsmith, Patricia. ''The Talented Mr. Ripley'', Vintage Crime/Black Lizard, 1992.</ref>

==Novels and adaptations==
Highsmith's first novel was ''Strangers on a Train'', which emerged in 1950, and which contained the violence that became her trademark.<ref name="Cohen">Patricia Cohen, [http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/11/books/11highsmith.html "The Haunts of Miss Highsmith"], ''[[New York Times]]'', December 10, 2009.</ref> At [[Truman Capote]]'s suggestion, she rewrote the novel at the [[Yaddo]] writer's colony in [[Saratoga Springs, New York]].<ref>[http://yaddo.org/yaddo/artistslists.shtml Yaddo Writers: June 1926 <U+2013> December 2007.]</ref> The book proved modestly successful when it was published in 1950. However, Hitchcock's 1951 [[Strangers on a Train (film)|film adaptation]] of the novel propelled Highsmith's career and reputation. Soon she became known as a writer of ironic, disturbing psychological mysteries highlighted by stark, startling prose.

Highsmith's second novel, ''[[The Price of Salt]]'', was published under the pseudonym Claire Morgan. It garnered wide attention as a [[lesbian]] novel because of its rare happy ending.<ref name="Cohen" /> She did not publicly associate herself with this book until late in her life, probably because she had extensively mined her personal life for the book's content.<ref name="Schenkar"/>

As her other novels were issued, moviemakers adapted them for screenplays: ''[[The Talented Mr. Ripley]]'' (1955), ''[[Ripley's Game]]'' (1974) and ''[[Edith's Diary]]'' (1977) all became films.

She was a lifelong [[diary|diarist]], and developed her writing style as a child, writing entries in which she fantasized that her neighbors had psychological problems and murderous personalities behind their fa<U+00E7>ades of normality, a [[theme (literature)|theme]] she would explore extensively in her novels.

==Major themes in her novels==
Highsmith included [[homosexuality|homosexual]] undertones in many of her novels and addressed the theme directly in ''The Price of Salt'' and the posthumously published ''[[Small g: a Summer Idyll]]''. The former novel is known for its happy ending, the first of its kind in lesbian fiction. Published in 1952 under the [[pseudonym]] Claire Morgan, it sold almost a million copies. The inspiration for the book's main character, Carol, was a woman Highsmith saw in [[Bloomingdale's]] department store, where she worked at the time. Highsmith acquired her address from the [[credit card]] details, and on two occasions after the book was written (in June 1950 and January 1951) spied on the woman without the latter's knowledge.

The [[protagonist]]s in many of Highsmith's novels are either morally compromised by circumstance or actively flouting the law. Many of her [[antihero]]es, often emotionally unstable young men, commit murder in fits of passion, or simply to extricate themselves from a bad situation. They are just as likely to escape justice as to receive it. The works of [[Franz Kafka]] and [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]] played a significant part in her own novels.

Her recurring character [[Tom Ripley]] &mdash; an [[amorality|amoral]], sexually ambiguous [[con artist]] and occasional murderer &mdash; was featured in a total of five novels, popularly known as the ''[[Ripliad]]'', written between 1955 and 1991. He was introduced in ''The Talented Mr. Ripley''.<ref>Coward-McCann, 1955</ref> After a 9 January 1956 TV adaptation on ''[[Studio One (TV series)|Studio One]]'', it was filmed by [[Ren<U+00E9> Cl<U+00E9>ment]] as ''Plein Soleil'' (1960, aka ''[[Purple Noon]]'' and ''Blazing Sun'') with [[Alain Delon]], whom Highsmith praised as the ideal Ripley. The novel was adapted under its original title in the [[The Talented Mr. Ripley (film)|1999 film]] directed by [[Anthony Minghella]], starring [[Matt Damon]], [[Gwyneth Paltrow]], [[Jude Law]] and [[Cate Blanchett]].

A later Ripley novel, ''[[Ripley's Game]]'', was filmed by [[Wim Wenders]] as ''[[Der Amerikanische Freund|The American Friend]]'' (1977). Under its original title, it was [[Ripley's Game (film)|filmed again in 2002]], directed by [[Liliana Cavani]] with [[John Malkovich]] in the title role. ''[[Ripley Under Ground (film)|Ripley Under Ground]]'' (2005), starring [[Barry Pepper]] as Ripley, was shown at the 2005 [[American Film Institute|AFI]] Film Festival but has not had a general release.

In 2009, [[BBC Radio 4]] adapted all five Ripley books with [[Ian Hart]] as Ripley.

==Personal life==
According to her [[biography]], ''Beautiful Shadow'', Highsmith's personal life was a troubled one; she was an [[alcoholism|alcoholic]] who never had a relationship that lasted for more than a few years, and she was seen by some of her contemporaries and acquaintances as [[misanthropic]] and cruel. She famously preferred the company of animals to that of people and once said, "My imagination functions much better when I don't have to speak to people."

"She was a mean, hard, cruel, unlovable, unloving person," said acquaintance Otto Penzler. "I could never penetrate how any human being could be that relentlessly ugly."<ref name=autogenerated1>[http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,275111,00.html Mystery Girl | The Talented Mr. Ripley | Biz | News | Entertainment Weekly]</ref>

Other friends and acquaintances were less caustic in their criticism, however; Gary Fisketjon, who published her later novels through Knopf, said that "she was rough, very difficult... but she was also plainspoken, dryly funny, and great fun to be around."<ref name=autogenerated1 />

Highsmith had relationships with women and men, but never married or had children. In 1943, she had an affair with the artist Allela Cornell (who committed suicide in 1946 by drinking [[nitric acid]]<ref> Wilson, A. ''Beautiful Shadow: A Life of Patricia Highsmith.'' Bloomsbury, London. 2004</ref>) and in 1949, she became close to novelist Marc Brandel. Between 1959 and 1961 she had a relationship with [[Marijane Meaker]], who wrote under the pseudonyms of Vin Packer and Ann Aldrich, but later wrote young adult fiction with the name M.E. Kerr. Meaker wrote of their affair in her memoir, ''Highsmith: A Romance of the 1950s''.

In the late 1980s, after 27 years of separation, Highsmith began sharing correspondence with Meaker again, and one day she showed up on her doorstep, slightly drunk and ranting bitterly. Meaker once recalled in an interview the horror she felt upon noticing the changes in Highsmith's personality by that point.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/donotmigrate/3596749/A-passion-that-turned-to-poison.html|location=London|work=The Daily Telegraph|title=A passion that turned to poison|first=Helena|last=De Bertodano|date=June 16, 2003}}</ref>

"Highsmith was never comfortable with blacks, and she was outspokenly [[anti-semitic]] <U+2014> so much so that when she was living in Switzerland in the 1980s, she invented nearly 40 aliases, identities she used in writing to various government bodies and newspapers, deploring the state of [[Israel]] and the 'influence' of the [[Jews]]".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/20/books/review/Winterson-t.html?ref=review|work=The New York Times|title=Patricia Highsmith, Hiding in Plain Sight|first=Jeanette|last=Winterson|date=December 20, 2009}}</ref> Nevertheless, some of her best friends were Jewish, such as author [[Arthur Koestler]], and admired Jewish writers such as [[Franz Kafka]] and [[Saul Bellow]]. She was accused of [[misogyny]] because of her satirical collection of short stories ''[[Little Tales of Misogyny]]''.

Highsmith loved woodworking tools and made several pieces of furniture. She kept pet snails; she worked without stopping. In later life she became stooped, with an [[osteoporosis|osteoporotic]] hump. <ref name="Schenkar"/> Though her writing &mdash; 22 novels and eight books of short stories &mdash; was highly acclaimed, especially outside of the United States, Highsmith preferred for her personal life to remain private. She had friendships and correspondences with several writers, and was also greatly inspired by art and the animal kingdom. 

Highsmith believed in American [[democracy|democratic]] ideals and in the promise of US history, but she was also highly critical of the reality of the country's 20th century culture and [[foreign policy]]. ''[[Tales of Natural and Unnatural Catastrophes]]'', her 1987 anthology of short stories, was notoriously [[anti-American]], and she often cast her homeland in a deeply unflattering light. Beginning in 1963, she resided exclusively in Europe. In 1978, she was head of the jury at the [[28th Berlin International Film Festival]].<ref name="berlinale">{{cite web|url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1978/04_jury_1978/04_Jury_1978.html|title=Berlinale 1978: Juries|accessdate=2010-08-04|work=berlinale.de}}</ref>

==Death==
Highsmith died of [[aplastic anemia]] and [[cancer]] in [[Locarno, Switzerland]], aged 74. She retained her United States citizenship, despite the tax penalties, of which she complained bitterly, from living for many years in France and Switzerland. She was cremated at the cemetery in [[Bellinzona]], and a memorial service conducted at the Catholic church in [[Tegna|Tegna, Switzerland]].<ref>''The Talented Miss Highsmith: The Secret Life and Serious Art of Patricia Highsmith'', by Joan Schenkar, 2009; ISBN# 978-0-312-30375-4</ref>

In gratitude to the place which helped inspire her writing career, she left her estate, worth an estimated $3 million, to the [[Yaddo]] colony.<ref name="Cohen" /> Her last novel, ''[[Small g: a Summer Idyll]]'', was published posthumously a month later.
