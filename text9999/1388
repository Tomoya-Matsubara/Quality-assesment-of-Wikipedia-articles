He is known as '''Prince Marko''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|<U+041A><U+0440><U+0430><U+0459><U+0435><U+0432><U+0438><U+045B> <U+041C><U+0430><U+0440><U+043A><U+043E>}}, ''Kraljevi<U+0107> Marko'', {{IPA-sh|kr<U+01CE><U+02D0><U+028E><U+025B><U+028B>it<U+0361><U+0255> m<U+00E2><U+02D0>rk<U+0254>|IPA}}) and '''King Marko''' ([[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]]: <U+041A><U+0440><U+0430><U+043B><U+0438> <U+041C><U+0430><U+0440><U+043A><U+043E>; {{lang-mk|K<U+0440>a<U+043B><U+0435> <U+041C><U+0430><U+0440><U+043A><U+043E>}}) in [[South Slavs|South Slavic]] [[oral tradition]], in which he has become a major character during the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] occupation of the [[Balkans]]. Marko's father, King [[Vuka<U+0161>in Mrnjav<U+010D>evi<U+0107>|Vuka<U+0161>in]], was the co-ruler alongside Serbian [[Tsar]] [[Stefan Uro<U+0161> V]], whose reign was marked by the weakening of the central authority and the gradual disintegration of the [[Serbian Empire]]. Vuka<U+0161>in's personal holdings included lands in western Macedonia, [[Kosovo]] and [[Metohija]]. In 1370 or 1371, he crowned Marko "young king"; this title included the possibility that Marko succeed the childless Uro<U+0161> on the Serbian throne.

On 26 September 1371, Vuka<U+0161>in's forces were defeated in the [[Battle of Maritsa]] and he lost his life. About two months later, Tsar Uro<U+0161> died. This formally made Marko the king of the Serbian land; however, great Serbian [[Nobility|noblemen]], who had become effectively independent from the central authority, did not even consider to recognise him as their supreme ruler. At an uncertain date after 1371, he became an Ottoman [[vassal]]. By 1377, significant parts of the territory he inherited from Vuka<U+0161>in were seized by other noblemen. King Marko in reality came to be a regional lord who ruled over a relatively small territory in western Macedonia. He funded the construction of the Monastery of Saint Demetrius near [[Skopje]], better known as [[Marko's Monastery]], finished in 1376. Marko died on 17 May 1395, fighting on the Ottoman side against the [[Wallachia]]ns in the [[Battle of Rovine]].

Although he was a ruler of modest historical significance, Marko became a major character in South Slavic oral tradition. He is venerated as a national hero by the [[Serbs]], [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonians]] and [[Bulgarians]], remembered in [[Balkans|Balkan]] folklore as a fearless and powerful protector of the weak, who fought against injustice and confronted the Turks during the early years of Ottoman occupation.

==Life==

===Until 1371===
Marko was born around 1335 as the first son of [[Vuka<U+0161>in Mrnjav<U+010D>evi<U+0107>]] and his wife, Alena.<ref name=fost49>Fostikov 2002, pp.49<U+2013>50.</ref> The patronymic "Mrnjav<U+010D>evi<U+0107>" derives from Mrnjava, described by 17th-century [[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusan]] historian [[Mavro Orbin]] as a minor nobleman from [[Zachlumia]] (in present-day [[Herzegovina]] and southern [[Dalmatia]]).<ref name=orbin>Orbin 1968, p.116.</ref> According to Orbin, Mrnjava's sons were born in [[Livno]] in western [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]],<ref name=orbin/> where he could have moved to after Zachlumia was annexed from Serbia by Bosnia in 1326.<ref name=fine362>Fine 1994, pp.362<U+2013>3.</ref> The Mrnjav<U+010D>evi<U+0107> family{{ref|Notea|n.b.1}} may have later supported [[Serbian Empire|Serbian Emperor]] ([[tsar]]) [[Stephen Uro<U+0161> IV Du<U+0161>an of Serbia|Stefan Du<U+0161>an]] in his preparations to invade Bosnia, as did other Zachlumian nobles, and fearing punishment, emigrated to the Serbian Empire before the war started.<ref name=fine362/><ref name=fine323>Fine 1994, p.323.</ref> These preparations possibly began two years ahead of the invasion,<ref name=fine323/> which took place in 1350. From that year comes the earliest written reference to Marko's father Vuka<U+0161>in, denoting him as Du<U+0161>an's appointed ''<U+017E>upan'' (district governor) of [[Prilep]],<ref name=fine362/><ref>Stojanovi<U+0107> 1902, p.37.</ref> which had been acquired by Serbia from [[Byzantium]] in 1334 together with other parts of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]].<ref>Fine 1994, p.288.</ref> In 1355, the Emperor suddenly died of a stroke at the age of about 47.<ref name=fine335>Fine 1994, p.335.</ref>

Du<U+0161>an was succeeded by his 19-year-old son [[Stefan Uro<U+0161> V|Uro<U+0161>]], who apparently regarded Marko Mrnjav<U+010D>evi<U+0107> as a man of trust. The new Emperor appointed him the head of the embassy he sent to Ragusa (now [[Dubrovnik]], [[Croatia]]) at the end of July 1361, to negotiate peace between the Empire and the [[Ragusan Republic]] during the hostilities that started earlier that year. The peace was not concluded on this occasion, but Marko successfully negotiated the release of Serbian merchants from [[Prizren]] detained by the Ragusans. He was also allowed to withdraw the silver his family had deposited in the city. The account of that embassy in a Ragusan document contains the earliest known undisputed reference to Marko Mrnjav<U+010D>evi<U+0107>.<ref>Mihalj<U+010D>i<U+0107> 1975, p.51. <U+0106>orovi<U+0107> 2001, "[http://www.rastko.rs/rastko-bl/istorija/corovic/istorija/3_9.html <U+0420><U+0430><U+0441><U+043F><U+0430><U+0434> <U+0421><U+0440><U+043F><U+0441><U+043A><U+0435> <U+0426><U+0430><U+0440><U+0435><U+0432><U+0438><U+043D><U+0435>]".</ref> An inscription written in 1356 on a wall of a church in the Macedonian region of [[Tikve<U+0161>]], mentions a Nikola and a Marko as governors in that region, but the identity of this Marko is disputed.<ref>Mihalj<U+010D>i<U+0107> 1975, p.77.</ref>

Du<U+0161>an's death was followed by the stirring of separatist activity in the Serbian Empire. The south-western territories, including [[Epirus]], [[Thessaly]], and lands in southern Albania, seceded by 1357.<ref><U+0160>uica 2000, p.15.</ref> The core of the state remained loyal to the new Emperor Uro<U+0161>. It consisted of three main regions: the western lands, including [[Principality of Zeta|Zeta]] and [[Travunia]] with the upper [[Drina|Drina Valley]]; the central Serbian lands; and Macedonia.<ref name=fine358>Fine 1994, p. 358</ref> Nevertheless, local noblemen asserted more and more independence from Uro<U+0161>' authority even in the part of the state that remained Serbian. Uro<U+0161> was weak and unable to counteract these separatist tendencies, becoming an inferior power in his own domain.<ref name=fine345>Fine 1994, p. 345.</ref> Serbian lords also fought each other over territories and influence.<ref><U+0160>uica 2000, p. 19</ref>
[[File:Kral Volka<U+0161>in large.jpg|right|thumb|190px|Marko's father King Vuka<U+0161>in, a fresco in the Psa<U+010D>a Monastery, Macedonia.]]
Vuka<U+0161>in Mrnjav<U+010D>evi<U+0107> was a skilful politician, and gradually assumed the main role in the Empire.<ref>Mihalj<U+010D>i<U+0107> 1975, p.83.</ref> In August or September 1365, Uro<U+0161> crowned him king, making him his co-ruler. By 1370, Marko's potential patrimony increased as Vuka<U+0161>in expanded his personal holdings from Prilep further into Macedonia, [[Kosovo]] and [[Metohija]], acquiring Prizren, [[Pristina]], [[Novo Brdo]], [[Skopje]], and [[Ohrid]].<ref name=fine362/> In a charter he issued on 5&nbsp;April 1370, Vuka<U+0161>in mentioned his wife Queen Alena, and his sons Marko and Andrija<U+0161>, signing himself as "Lord of the Serb and Greek Lands, and of the Western Provinces" ({{Script|Cyrs|<U+0433><U+043E><U+0441><U+043F><U+043E><U+0434><U+0438><U+043D><U+044C> <U+0437><U+0454><U+043C><U+043B><U+0438> <U+0441><U+0440><U+044C><U+0431><U+044C><U+0441><U+043A><U+043E><U+0438> <U+0438> <U+0433><U+0440><U+044C><U+043A><U+0461><U+043C><U+044C> <U+0438> <U+0437><U+0430><U+043F><U+0430><U+0434><U+043D><U+0438><U+043C><U+044C> <U+0441><U+0442><U+0440><U+0430><U+043D><U+0430><U+043C><U+044C>}}).<ref>Miklo<U+0161>i<U+010D> 1858, [http://www.archive.org/stream/monumentaserbic00miklgoog#page/n200/mode/1up p.180], <U+2116> CLXVII.</ref> In late 1370 or early 1371, Vuka<U+0161>in crowned Marko ''Young King''.<ref name=sui20><U+0160>uica 2000, p. 20</ref> This title had been given to heirs presumptive of Serbian kings to secure their position as successors to the throne. Since Uro<U+0161> was childless, Marko could thus become his successor, starting a new<U+2014>Vuka<U+0161>in's<U+2014>dynasty of Serbian sovereigns.<ref name=fine362/> This would mean the end of the two-centuries-long reign of the [[Nemanji<U+0107> dynasty]]. Most of the other Serbian lords were not happy with this situation, which strengthened their aspirations towards independence from the central authority.<ref name=sui20/>

Vuka<U+0161>in wanted to obtain a well-connected spouse for his eldest son Marko. A princess of the [[Croats|Croatian]] [[House of <U+0160>ubi<U+0107>]] from [[Dalmatia]], was sent by her father Grgur to the court of their relative [[Tvrtko I of Bosnia|Tvrtko I]], the [[Ban (title)|ban]] of Bosnia, to be raised and suitably married by Tvrtko's mother [[Jelena <U+0160>ubi<U+0107>|Jelena]]. The latter was the daughter of [[George II <U+0160>ubi<U+0107> of Bribir|George II <U+0160>ubi<U+0107>]], whose maternal grandfather was Serbian King [[Stephen Dragutin of Serbia|Dragutin Nemanji<U+0107>]].<ref>Fajfri<U+0107> (2000), "[http://www.rastko.rs/istorija/zfajfric-kotromanici_c.html#_Toc486040898 <U+041F><U+0440><U+0432><U+0438> <U+041A><U+043E><U+0442><U+0440><U+043E><U+043C><U+0430><U+043D><U+0438><U+045B><U+0438>]".</ref> As the ban and his mother approved of Vuka<U+0161>in's idea to marry the <U+0160>ubi<U+0107> princess to Marko, the wedding was about to be held.<ref name=jirecek>Jire<U+010D>ek 1911, [http://www.archive.org/stream/geschichtederser00jire#page/430/mode/1up p.430].</ref><ref name=theiner97>Theiner 1860, [http://www.archive.org/stream/p1veteramonument02thei#page/97/mode/1up p.97], <U+2116> CXC.</ref> In April 1370, however, [[Pope Urban V]] sent a letter to Tvrtko in which he forbade him to give the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] lady in marriage to the "son of His Magnificence, the King of Serbia, a [[East<U+2013>West Schism|schismatic]]" (''filio magnifici viri Regis Rascie scismatico'').<ref name=theiner97/> The pope also wrote about this impending "offence to the Christian faith" to King [[Louis I of Hungary]], the nominal overlord of the ban,<ref>Theiner 1860, [http://www.archive.org/stream/p1veteramonument02thei#page/97/mode/1up p.97], <U+2116> CLXXXIX.</ref> and that marriage never happened.<ref name=jirecek/> Marko subsequently married Jelena, the daughter of [[Radoslav Hlapen]], the lord of [[Veria]] and [[Edessa, Greece|Edessa]], the major Serbian nobleman in southern Macedonia.<ref name=mih170>Mihalj<U+010D>i<U+0107> 1975, pp. 170<U+2013>1</ref>

In the spring of 1371, Marko participated in the preparations for a campaign against [[Nikola Altomanovi<U+0107>]], the major lord in the west of the Empire.<ref name="ReferenceA">Mihalj<U+010D>i<U+0107> 1975, p. 137; Fine 1994, p. 377</ref> The campaign was planned jointly by King Vuka<U+0161>in and [[<U+0110>ura<U+0111> I Bal<U+0161>i<U+0107>]], the lord of [[Principality of Zeta|Zeta]], who was married to Olivera, the king's daughter. In July of that year, Vuka<U+0161>in and Marko camped with their army outside [[Shkod<U+00EB>r|Scutari]], on Bal<U+0161>i<U+0107>'s territory, ready to make an incursion towards [[Onogo<U+0161>t]] in Altomanovi<U+0107>'s land. The attack never happened, as the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] threatened the land of [[Despot (court title)|Despot]] [[Jovan Uglje<U+0161>a]], the lord of [[Serres]], Vuka<U+0161>in's younger brother who ruled in eastern Macedonia. The forces of the Mrnjav<U+010D>evi<U+0107>s were quickly directed eastward.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Having in vain looked for allies, the two brothers finally entered with their own troops into the territory controlled by the Ottomans. At the [[Battle of Maritsa]] on 26&nbsp;September 1371, the Turks annihilated the Serbian army.<ref><U+0106>orovi<U+0107> 2001, "[http://www.rastko.rs/rastko-bl/istorija/corovic/istorija/3_10.html <U+041C><U+0430><U+0440><U+0438><U+0447><U+043A><U+0430> <U+043F><U+043E><U+0433><U+0438><U+0431><U+0438><U+0458><U+0430>]".</ref> The bodies of Vuka<U+0161>in and Jovan Uglje<U+0161>a were never found. The place where the battle was fought, near the village of [[Ormenio]] in the east of present-day Greece, has ever since been called ''S<U+0131>rp S<U+0131>nd<U+0131><U+011F><U+0131>'' ("Serbian Rout" in [[Turkish language|Turkish]]). The outcome of this battle had serious consequences for the entire region because it opened up the [[Balkans]] to the Turks.<ref name=fine379>Fine 1994, pp. 379<U+2013>82</ref>

===After 1371===
[[Image:Central balkans 1373 1395.png|right|thumb|200px|The approximate borders of the territory ruled by King Marko after 1377 (shown in darker green).]]
When his father died, "young king" Marko legally became a king and the co-ruler of Emperor Uro<U+0161>. The end of the Nemanji<U+0107> dynasty came soon afterwards, when Uro<U+0161> died on 2 or 4&nbsp;December 1371, which formally made Marko the sovereign of the Serbian state.<ref name=mih168>Mihalj<U+010D>i<U+0107> 1975, p.168.</ref> Serbian lords, however, did not even consider to recognise him as their supreme ruler,<ref name=mih168/> and the separatism within the state increased even more.<ref name=fine379/> After the demise of the two brothers and the destruction of their armies, the Mrnjav<U+010D>evi<U+0107> family was left without any real power.<ref name=mih168/> Lords surrounding Marko exploited the opportunity and seized significant parts of his patrimony. By 1372, <U+0110>ura<U+0111> I Bal<U+0161>i<U+0107> took Prizren and Pe<U+0107>, and Prince [[Lazar Hrebeljanovi<U+0107>]] took Pristina.<ref><U+0160>uica 2000, pp.35<U+2013>6.</ref> By 1377 [[Vuk Brankovi<U+0107>]] acquired Skopje, and Albanian magnate [[Andrea Gropa]] became practically independent in Ohrid. The latter possibly remained a vassal to Marko as he had been to Vuka<U+0161>in.<ref name=fine379/> Gropa's son-in-law was Marko's relative Ostoja Rajakovi<U+0107> of the [[Serb clans|clan]] of Ugar<U+010D>i<U+0107> from Travunia. He was one of the Serbian nobles from Zachlumia and Travunia (adjacent principalities in present-day Herzegovina) who had received lands in the newly conquered parts of Macedonia during Emperor Du<U+0161>an's reign.<ref><U+0160>uica 2000, p.42.</ref>
[[Image:Markovi Kuli zapaden del.JPG|left|thumb|250px|The remains of Marko's fortress above [[Prilep]], known as ''[[Markovi Kuli]]'' ("Marko's towers").]]
The only significant town that Marko kept was Prilep, from which his father's rise had started. King Marko then became a petty prince who ruled over a relatively small territory in western Macedonia, bordered in the north by the [[<U+0160>ar mountains]] and Skopje, in the east by the [[Vardar]] and the [[Crna (river)|Crna Reka]] rivers, and in the west by Ohrid. The southern limits of his territory are uncertain.<ref name=mih170/> Marko was not the sole ruler even in this little domain, as he shared it with his younger brother Andrija<U+0161>, who had his own land in it.<ref name=fine379/> Their mother, Queen Alena, became a nun after Vuka<U+0161>in's death, taking the monastic name Jelisaveta, but she was the co-ruler with Andrija<U+0161> for some time after 1371. The youngest brother, [[Dmitar Mrnjav<U+010D>evi<U+0107>|Dmitar]], lived on the territory controlled by Andrija<U+0161>. There was yet another brother named Ivani<U+0161>, about whom very little is known.<ref>Fostikov 2002, p.51.</ref> The exact date when Marko became an Ottoman [[vassal]] is uncertain, but it probably did not happen immediately after the [[Battle of Maritsa]].<ref name=mih164>Mihalj<U+010D>i<U+0107> 1975, pp.164<U+2013>5.</ref>

At some point, Marko separated from his spouse Jelena and lived with Todora, the wife of a man named Grgur. Jelena returned to her father Radoslav Hlapen in Veria. Marko later sought to reconcile with her, but to get his wedded wife back, he first had to send Todora to Hlapen. As Marko's domain was bordered to the south by Hlapen's land, this reconciliation may have been motivated by the fact that Marko did not want an enemy in the south, after all the territorial losses that he had in the north.<ref name=mih170/> That this marital episode is known is due to scribe Dobre, a subject of Marko's. Dobre transcribed a [[liturgical book]] for the church in the village of Kalu<U+0111>erec,{{ref|Noteb|n.b.2}} and when he finished the job, he wrote an inscription in the book which begins as follows:<ref>Stojanovi<U+0107> 1902, pp.58<U+2013>9</ref>

:Glory to God the Finisher for ever and ever, amen, amen, amen. This book was written in [[Pore<U+010D>e|Pore<U+010D>je]], in the village called Kalu<U+0111>erec, in the days of the pious King Marko, when he handed over Todora the wife of Grgur to Hlapen, and took back his first-wedded wife Jelena, Hlapen's daughter.

[[File:A fresco of King Marko and King Volkashin at Marko's Monastery Skopje Macedonia.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The fresco ensemble above the south entrance to the church of [[Marko's Monastery]]. It comprises the images of King Marko (left) and King Vuka<U+0161>in (right, rather damaged), complemented by a semicircle of seven saintly busts, all of which frame the portrait of [[Demetrius of Thessaloniki|St. Demetrius]].]]
Marko's fortress was situated on a hill to the north of present-day Prilep. Its remains, partially well-preserved, are called ''[[Markovi Kuli]]'' ("Marko's towers"). Beneath the fortress lies a village named Varo<U+0161><U+2014>the site of medieval Prilep. The village contains the Monastery of Archangel Michael renovated by Marko and Vuka<U+0161>in, whose portraits are depicted on the walls of the monastery's church.<ref name=mih170/> Marko was the [[ktetor]] of the Church of Saint Sunday in Prizren, which was finished in 1371, just before the Battle of Maritsa. In the inscription above the church's entrance, he is titled "young king".<ref>Mihalj<U+010D>i<U+0107> 1975, p.166.</ref>

The Monastery of St. Demetrius, popularly known as [[Marko's Monastery]], is situated at the village of [[Markova Su<U+0161>ica]] near Skopje. Its construction lasted from c.&nbsp;1345 to 1376 or 1377. Kings Marko and Vuka<U+0161>in, its ktetors, are portrayed above the southern entrance of the monastery's church.<ref name=fost49/> Marko is represented as an austere-looking man in purple clothes, wearing a crown adorned with strings of pearls. With his left hand he holds a scroll, the text on which begins with the words: "I, in the Christ God the pious King Marko, built and inscribed this divine temple&nbsp;..." In his right hand he holds a big horn that symbolizes the horn of oil with which the [[Old Testament]] kings were [[Anointing|anointed]] at their enthronement (as described, e.g., in [[Books of Samuel|1 Samuel]] [[s:Bible (King James)/1 Samuel#Chapter_16|16:13]]). According to an interpretation, Marko is shown here as the king chosen and anointed by God to lead his people in the times of crisis after the Battle of Maritsa.<ref name=mih168/>

Marko [[Mint (coin)|minted]] his own money, as did his father and other Serbian nobles of the time.<ref>Mihalj<U+010D>i<U+0107> 1975, p.181.</ref> His silver [[coin]]s weighed 1.11&nbsp;grams,<ref><U+0160>uica 2000, pp.133<U+2013>6.</ref> and were produced in three types. In two of them, the [[Obverse and reverse|obverse]] contained this text in five lines: {{Script|Cyrs|<U+0412><U+042C><U+0425><U+0410>/<U+0411><U+0410><U+0411><U+041B><U+0413><U+041E><U+0412>/<U+0462><U+0420><U+041D><U+0418><U+041A><U+0420>/<U+0410><U+041B><U+042C><U+041C><U+0410>/<U+0420><U+041A><U+041E>}} "In the Christ God, the pious King Marko".<ref name=mandic>Mandi<U+0107> 2003, pp.24<U+2013>5.</ref> The reverse depicted [[Christ]] seated on a throne in the first type, and Christ seated in a [[mandorla]] in the second. In the third type, the reverse represented Christ in a mandorla, and the obverse contained the text in four lines: {{Script|Cyrs|<U+0411><U+041B><U+0413><U+041E>/<U+0412><U+0462><U+0420><U+041D><U+0418>/<U+041A><U+0420><U+0410><U+041B><U+042C>/<U+041C><U+0410><U+0420><U+041A><U+041E>}} "Pious King Marko".<ref name=mandic/> With this simple title Marko referred to himself also in the aforementioned church inscription. He did not include any territorial designation in his title, probably in tacit acknowledgement of his limited sway.<ref name=mih170/> His brother Andrija<U+0161> also minted his own money; still the [[money supply]] on the territory ruled by the Mrnjav<U+010D>evi<U+0107> brothers mostly consisted of the coins that had been struck by King Vuka<U+0161>in and Tsar Uro<U+0161>.<ref>Mihalj<U+010D>i<U+0107> 1975, p.183.</ref> It is estimated that about 150 pieces of Marko's coins are kept today in various [[Numismatics|numismatic]] collections.<ref name=mandic/>

By 1379, Prince Lazar Hrebeljanovic, the lord of [[Pomoravlje (region)|Pomoravlje]], emerged as the first and most powerful among Serbian nobles.<ref name=mih164/><ref>Mihalj<U+010D>i<U+0107> 1975, p.220.</ref> In his signatures, he titled himself as the [[Autokrator]] of all the [[Serbs]] ({{Script|Cyrs|<U+0441><U+0430><U+043C><U+043E><U+0434><U+0440><U+044C><U+0436><U+0446><U+044C> <U+0432><U+044C><U+0441><U+0463><U+043C><U+044C> <U+0421><U+0440><U+0431><U+044C><U+043B><U+0465><U+043C><U+044C>}}); nevertheless, he was not powerful enough to unite all Serbian lands under his authority. The [[Bal<U+0161>i<U+0107> noble family|Bal<U+0161>i<U+0107>]], Mrnjav<U+010D>evi<U+0107>, [[Konstantin Draga<U+0161>]] (maternally a Nemanji<U+0107>), Vuk Brankovi<U+0107>, and Radoslav Hlapen, ruled in their respective domains without consulting with Lazar.<ref name=mih164/> Another king besides Marko advanced on the political scene: in 1377, the [[Metropolitan bishop#Orthodox|Metropolitan]] of [[Mile<U+0161>eva monastery|Mile<U+0161>eva]] crowned Tvrtko I, maternally related to the Nemanji<U+0107> dynasty, King of the Serbs and of Bosnia. He had previously taken some western parts of the former Serbian Empire.<ref>Fine 1994, p.393.</ref>

On 15&nbsp;June 1389, Serbian forces led by Prince Lazar, Vuk Brankovi<U+0107>, and Tvrtko's nobleman [[Vlatko Vukovi<U+0107>]] of Zachlumia, confronted the Ottoman army led by Sultan [[Murad I]] at the [[Battle of Kosovo]], the most famous battle in Serbia's medieval history.<ref name=fine408>Fine 1994, pp.408<U+2013>11.</ref> With the bulk of both armies being wiped out, both Lazar and Murad lost their lives and the battle concluded in a stalemate. However, in the wake of it the Serbs were left with too few men to effectively defend their lands, while the Turks had many more troops in the east. Consequently, the Serbian principalities that were not already Ottoman vassals, one after the other became so in the following years.<ref name=fine408/>

In 1394, a group of Ottoman vassals in the Balkans decided to renounce their vassalage.<ref name=Fostikov52>Fostikov 2002, pp.52<U+2013>3.</ref> Marko was not one of them, but his younger brothers Andrija<U+0161> and Dmitar refused to remain under Turkish dominance. In the spring of 1394, they left their homeland and emigrated to the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], entering into the service of [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|King Sigismund]]. They travelled via Ragusa, where they withdrew two thirds of their late father's deposit of 96.73&nbsp;kilograms of silver, the remaining third being left for Marko. Andrija<U+0161> and Dmitar were the first Serbian nobles who emigrated to Hungary: the northward migration of the Serbs would continue throughout the Ottoman occupation.<ref name=Fostikov52/>

In 1395, the Turks assailed [[Wallachia]] to punish its ruler [[Mircea I of Wallachia|Mircea I]] for his incursions into their territory.<ref name=Fine424>Fine 1994, p.424.</ref> Three Serb vassals fought on the Ottoman side: King Marko, Lord Konstantin Draga<U+0161>, and Despot [[Stefan Lazarevi<U+0107>]], the son and heir of Prince Lazar. The [[Battle of Rovine]] took place on 17&nbsp;May 1395, and was won by the Wallachians. King Marko and Konstantin Draga<U+0161> were killed in it. After their deaths, the Turks annexed their lands, and combined them into a single Ottoman province centred in [[Kyustendil]].<ref name=Fine424/> Thirty-six years after the Battle of Rovine, [[Constantine of Kostenets|Konstantin the Philosopher]] wrote the ''Biography of Despot Stefan Lazarevi<U+0107>''. In this book, Konstantin recorded an account of what Marko said to Draga<U+0161> on the eve of the battle: "I pray the Lord to help the Christians, no matter if I will be the first to die in this war."<ref>Konstantin 2000, "[http://www.rastko.rs/knjizevnost/liturgicka/konstantin-zitije_desp_stefana_c.html <U+041E> <U+043F><U+043E><U+0433><U+0438><U+0431><U+0438><U+0458><U+0438> <U+043A><U+0440><U+0430><U+0459><U+0430> <U+041C><U+0430><U+0440><U+043A><U+0430> <U+0438> <U+041A><U+043E><U+043D><U+0441><U+0442><U+0430><U+043D><U+0442><U+0438><U+043D><U+0430> <U+0414><U+0440><U+0430><U+0433><U+0430><U+0448><U+0430>]".</ref>

==In folk poetry==

===Serbian epic poetry===
Marko Mrnjav<U+010D>evi<U+0107> is the most popular hero of [[Serbian epic poetry]],<ref name=noyes>Noyes 1913, "[http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/hbs/hbs04.htm Introduction]".</ref> in which he is referred to as Kraljevi<U+0107> Marko; with the word ''kraljevi<U+0107>'' meaning "prince",<ref name=noyes/> or "king's son". This informal title was often attached to the names of King Vuka<U+0161>in's sons in contemporary sources. It was also used post-positively as a surname: Marko Kraljevi<U+0107>.{{ref|Notec|n.b.3}} The title/surname was adopted by Serbian oral tradition, and became an integral part of the hero's name.<ref name=rudic>Rudi<U+0107> 2001, p.89.</ref>
[[Image:Hercegovac pjeva uz gusle.JPG|right|thumb|185px|A [[Herzegovina|Herzegovinian]] sings to the [[gusle]] (drawing from 1823). Serbian epic poems were often sung to the accompaniment of this traditional bowed string instrument.]]
Poems about Kraljevi<U+0107> Marko are not sequels that continue the same story line<U+2014>the only thing that binds them into a single poetic cycle is the hero himself.<ref name=deretic>Dereti<U+0107> 2000, "[http://www.rastko.rs/knjizevnost/jderetic_knjiz/jderetic-knjiz_05_c.html <U+0415><U+043F><U+0441><U+043A><U+0430> <U+043F><U+043E><U+0432><U+0435><U+0441><U+043D><U+0438><U+0446><U+0430> <U+0441><U+0440><U+043F><U+0441><U+043A><U+043E><U+0433> <U+043D><U+0430><U+0440><U+043E><U+0434><U+0430>]".</ref> His adventures are narrated with the goal of illuminating his character and personality.<ref name=low>Low 1922, "[http://www.archive.org/stream/balladsofmarkokr00lowduoft#page/n35/mode/2up The Marko of the Ballads]".</ref> The epic Marko was endowed with a life of 300&nbsp;years, and other prominent heroes from the 14th to the 16th&nbsp;centuries appear sometimes as his companions,<ref name=deretic/> including [[Milo<U+0161> Obili<U+0107>]], [[Hrelja|Relja Krilatica]], [[Vuk Grgurevi<U+0107>|Vuk the Fiery Dragon]], and [[John Hunyadi|Sibinjanin Janko]] with his nephew Banovi<U+0107> Sekula.<ref>Popovi<U+0107> 1988, pp.24<U+2013>8.</ref> The poems contain few historical facts about Marko Mrnjav<U+010D>evi<U+0107>, notably his connection to the epoch of the disintegration of the Serbian Empire, and his vassalage to the Ottomans.<ref name=deretic/> They were composed by anonymous Serbian folk bards during the Ottoman occupation of their land. American [[Slavic studies|Slavicist]] George Rapall Noyes characterized them as "combining tragic [[pathos]] with almost [[ribald]] comedy in a fashion worthy of an [[Elizabethan literature|Elizabethan]] playwright."<ref name=noyes/>

Serbian epic poetry accords with the historical fact of King Vuka<U+0161>in being Marko's father. It asserts that his mother was Jevrosima, the sister of [[voivode]] Mom<U+010D>ilo, the lord of the [[Pirlitor]] Fortress in [[Durmitor|Mount Durmitor]] (in [[Old Herzegovina]]). Mom<U+010D>ilo is described as a man of immense size and strength, possessing magical attributes: a [[winged horse]] and a [[sabre]] with eyes. Vuka<U+0161>in murdered him with the help of the voivode's young wife Vidosava, despite Jevrosima's self-sacrificing attempt to save her brother. Instead of marrying Vidosava, as was the initial plan, Vuka<U+0161>in killed the treacherous woman. He took Jevrosima from Pirlitor to his capital city of Scutari and married her, as the dying Mom<U+010D>ilo had actually advised him to do. She bore him two sons, Marko and Andrija<U+0161>, and the poem recounting these events concludes with the statement that Marko took after his uncle Mom<U+010D>ilo.<ref>Low 1922, "[http://www.archive.org/stream/balladsofmarkokr00lowduoft#page/n47/mode/2up The Marriage of King Vuka<U+0161>in]".</ref> This epic character corresponds historically to the Bulgarian brigand and mercenary [[Momchil]], who was for some time in the service of Serbian Tsar Du<U+0161>an; he later became a despot and died in 1345 in the [[Battle of Peritheorion]].<ref><U+0106>orovi<U+0107> 2001, "[http://www.rastko.rs/rastko-bl/istorija/corovic/istorija/3_7.html <U+0421><U+0442><U+0432><U+0430><U+0440><U+0430><U+045A><U+0435> <U+0441><U+0440><U+043F><U+0441><U+043A><U+043E><U+0433> <U+0446><U+0430><U+0440><U+0441><U+0442><U+0432><U+0430>]".</ref> According to another account, Marko and Andrija<U+0161> were born by a ''[[Slavic fairies#Vila|vila]]'' (Slavic mountain [[nymph]]), whom Vuka<U+0161>in wedded after he caught her by a lake and took off her wings so that she could not fly away.<ref>Bogi<U+0161>i<U+0107> 1878, [http://www.archive.org/stream/narodnepjesmeiz00bogigoog#page/n411/mode/2up pp. 231<U+2013>2].</ref>

As Marko matured he developed a strong individuality, and Vuka<U+0161>in once declared that he had no control over his son, who went wherever he wanted, drank and brawled. Marko grew up into an extraordinarily large and strong man, with a rather terrifying appearance which was at the same time somewhat comical. He wore a wolf-skin cap pulled low over his dark eyes; his massive black moustache was as large as a six-months-old lamb; his cloak was a shaggy wolf-pelt. A [[Damascus steel|Damascus sabre]] swung at his girdle and a spear was slung across his back. Marko's [[shestopyor|six-flanged mace]] weighed 66&nbsp;[[Oka (mass)|oka]]s (85&nbsp;kilograms), which he hung at the left side of his saddle, balancing it with a well-filled wineskin attached to the saddle's right side. His grip was such that he could squeeze drops of water out of a piece of dry [[European Cornel|cornel]] wood. He defeated a succession of the greatest champions, fighting triumphantly against overwhelming odds.<ref name=deretic/><ref name=low/>

The hero's inseparable companion and friend was his piebald wonder-horse <U+0160>arac, who could talk. When Marko drank he always gave <U+0160>arac an equal share of the wine.<ref name=low/> The horse could leap three [[Spear#Infantry Spears 2|spear-length]]s high and four spear-lengths forward, which enabled Marko to pursue and capture the dangerous and elusive ''vila'' called Ravijojla. She then became his [[Blood brother|blood sister]], promising to aid him if he should ever be in evil straits. When Ravijojla helped him to kill the monstrous, three-hearted [[Musa Kesed<U+017E>ija]], who almost defeated him, Marko grieved because he had slain a better man than himself.<ref>Low 1922, "[http://www.archive.org/stream/balladsofmarkokr00lowduoft#page/20/mode/2up Marko Kraljevi<U+0107> and the Vila]"</ref><ref>Low 1922, "[http://www.archive.org/stream/balladsofmarkokr00lowduoft#page/124/mode/2up Marko Kraljevi<U+0107> and Musa Kesed<U+017E>ija]"</ref>
[[File:Milo<U+0161>, Marko i vila.jpg|right|thumb|220px|Prince Marko, [[Milo<U+0161> Obili<U+0107>]], and the ''[[Slavic fairies#Vila|vila]]'' Ravijojla in a painting by [[Paja Jovanovi<U+0107>]] (1906) inspired by the poem "[http://www.archive.org/stream/balladsofmarkokr00lowduoft#page/21/mode/1up Marko Kraljevi<U+0107> and the Vila]". Its plot takes place on [[Miro<U+010D>|Mount Miro<U+010D>]].]]
Marko is portrayed as a protector of the weak and helpless, a fighter against Turkish bullies and against injustice in general. He acted as an ideal bearer of patriarchal and natural norms of life: amidst a Turkish [[military camp]], he beheaded the Turk who dishonourably killed his father; he abolished the marriage tax by killing the tyrant who imposed it on the people of Kosovo; he saved the sultan's daughter from an unwanted marriage, after she entreated him as her blood brother to help her; he rescued three Serbian voivodes, his blood brothers, from a dungeon; he helped animals in distress. He is shown as a rescuer and benefactor of people, and a promoter of life; "Prince Marko is remembered like a fair day in the year," as is stated in a poem.<ref name=deretic/>

A striking characteristic of Marko's was his devotion to his mother Jevrosima, for whom he cherished a limitless reverence and love. He constantly sought her advice and obeyed it even when it contradicted his own impulses and desires. She lived with Marko at his mansion in Prilep, shining as his lodestar that led him toward the good and away from the evil, along the path of moral improvement and Christian virtues.<ref>Popovi<U+0107> 1988, pp.70<U+2013>7.</ref> Marko's honesty and high moral courage are conspicuous in the poem in which he happened to be the only person who knew the will of the late Tsar Du<U+0161>an regarding his heir. Marko refused to bear false witness in favour of the pretenders<U+2014>his own father and uncles<U+2014>and spoke out the truth that Du<U+0161>an had appointed his son Uro<U+0161> heir to the Serbian throne. This almost cost him life as Vuka<U+0161>in tried to kill him.<ref name=low/>

Marko is also represented as a loyal vassal to the Ottoman sultan, fighting to protect the potentate and his empire from dangerous outlaws. When summoned by the sultan, he participated in Turkish military campaigns.<ref name=deretic/> Yet even in this relationship, the hero's strong personality and sense of dignity were expressed. More than once the sultan actually showed anxiety towards his burly, wayward vassal,<ref name=low/> and the interviews between Marko and his imperial master usually ended in this way:

Marko's [[fealty]] was skilfully combined with the suggestion that the nominal servant was in reality greater than his lord. Serbian bards thus reversed the roles and turned the tables on their conquerors. This dual aspect of Marko could be a reason why he became a national hero of the Serbs: for them he grew into "the proud symbol expressive of the unbroken spirit that lived on in spite of disaster and defeat,"<ref name=low/> as stated by David Halyburton Low, translator of Serbian epic poems.

In fights, Marko used not only his strength and prowess but also cunning and trickery. Despite all his extraordinary qualities, he was not depicted as an abstract superhero or a god, but as a mortal man. There were opponents in the presence of whom his courage wavered and those who surpassed him in strength; there were times when his spirit quailed. He had his evil moments, when he acted capricious, short-tempered, or even with cruelty, but these were few in number. The prevailing traits of the hero's nature were honesty, self-sacrificing loyalty, and the fundamental goodness.<ref name=low/>

With his comically stylized appearance and behaviour, and his wry remarks at opponents' expense, Marko is regarded as the most humorous character in Serbian epic poetry.<ref name=deretic/> When a [[Black Arab (mythology)|Moor]] smote him with a mace, the hero spoke to the attacker laughingly, "O valiant black Moor!

Marko, aged 300&nbsp;years, rode on 160-years-old <U+0160>arac by the seashore towards Mount Urvina, when a ''vila'' told him that he was going to die. Marko then stooped over a well and saw no reflection of his head from the water, [[hydromancy]] thus confirming the ''vila'''s words. He killed <U+0160>arac lest Turks capture and use him for menial labor, and gave his beloved companion an elaborate burial. He broke his sword and spear and threw his mace far out into the sea, before lying down to die. The hero's body was found seven days later by Vaso, the [[abbot]] of the [[Hilandar|Monastery of Hilandar]] on [[Mount Athos]], and his deacon Isaija. Abbot Vaso transported Marko to Mount Athos and buried him at the monastery, leaving no sign of his grave.<ref>Low 1922, "[http://www.archive.org/stream/balladsofmarkokr00lowduoft#page/174/mode/2up The Death of Marko Kraljevi<U+0107>]".</ref>

Therefore, the same tales are also seen as part of the ethnic heritage of the present-day Macedonian nation.

According to local legends, Marko's mother was Evrosiya (<U+0415><U+0432><U+0440><U+043E><U+0441><U+0438><U+044F>), sister of the [[Bulgarian people|Bulgarian]] [[voivoda]] [[Momchil]], who ruled territories in the [[Rhodope Mountains]]. At the birth of Marko, three [[narecnitsi]] (fate-fairies) appeared and foretold that he would become a hero and replace his father, the king Vuka<U+0161>in. When his father heard this he threw his son in a basket in the river to get rid of him. But a [[samodiva]] (also called samovila) named Vila found Marko and brought him up, becoming his foster mother. Because Marko suckled the samodiva's milk, he acquired supernatural powers. He is portrayed as a Bulgarian fighter for freedom against the Turks. He has a winged horse, called Sharkolia (meaning "dappled") and a stepsister&nbsp;<U+2014> the samodiva Gyura. The Bulgarian legends incorporate important fragments of pagan mythology and beliefs, even though the Marko epos itself was created as late as the 14<U+2013>18th century. Among Bulgarian epic songs, songs from the cycle about Krali Marko are particularly common and occupy a central place in it.<ref>The River Danube in Balkan Slavic Folksongs, Ethnologia Balkanica (01/1997), Burkhart, Dagmar; Issue: 01/1997 , pp.&nbsp;53<U+2013>60</ref><ref>A History of Macedonian Literature 865<U+2013>1944, Volume 112 of Slavistic Printings and Reprintings, Charles A. Moser, Publisher Mouton, 1972.</ref>
Some prominent Bulgarian folklorists who collected stories about Marko were teacher [[Trayko Kitanchev]] (in the region of [[Resen (town)|Resen]] in Western Macedonia), and [[Marko Cepenkov]] from [[Prilep]] (in different areas in the region).<ref><U+041F><U+0440><U+0438><U+043B><U+0435><U+043F>; <U+0437><U+0430><U+043F>. <U+041C><U+0430><U+0440><U+043A><U+043E> <U+0426><U+0435><U+043F><U+0435><U+043D><U+043A><U+043E><U+0432> (<U+0421><U+0431><U+041D><U+0423> 2, <U+0441>. 116<U+2013>120, <U+2116> 2 <U+2013> "<U+041C><U+0430><U+0440><U+043A><U+043E> <U+0433><U+0440><U+0430><U+0431><U+0438><U+0442> <U+0410><U+043D><U+0433><U+0435><U+043B><U+0438><U+043D><U+0430>").</ref>

==In legends==
South Slavic legends about Kraljevi<U+0107> Marko or Krali Marko are mostly based on mythological motifs that are much older than the historical Marko Mrnjav<U+010D>evi<U+0107>. There are differences between the hero's image in the legends and that in the folk poems. In some areas he was imagined as a giant who walked stepping on hilltops, his head knocking the clouds. It was also narrated that he helped God in shaping the Earth in ancient times, and created the river gorge of [[Demir Kapija]] ("Iron Gate") with a stroke of his sabre. Thus he drained the sea that covered the regions of [[Bitola]], [[Mariovo]], and [[Tikve<U+0161>]] in Macedonia, which enabled people to inhabit them. After the Earth was shaped, he took to arrogantly showing off his strength. God took it away from him by leaving a bag as heavy as the Earth on a road: when Marko tried to lift it, he lost his gigantic strength and became an ordinary man.<ref name=radenkovic/>

Legends also have it that the hero acquired his strength after he was suckled by a ''[[Slavic fairies#Vila|vila]]''. King Vuka<U+0161>in threw his little son Marko into a river, because he did not resemble him, but the boy was saved by a cowherd who adopted him as a son, and the ''vila'' suckled him. By other accounts, Marko was a shepherd or a cowherd who found a ''vila's'' children lost in a mountain, and made a shade for them against the scorching sun, or gave them water. As a reward, the ''vila'' suckled him three times, after which he was able to lift and throw a huge boulder. In an [[Istria]]n  version of this story, he made a shade for two snakes instead of the children. In a Bulgarian version, each of the three draughts of milk that he suckled from the ''vila'''s breast, turned into a snake.<ref name=radenkovic/>

He was regularly associated with huge solitary [[boulder]]s and indentations in rocks. The boulders were said to be thrown by Marko from a hill, the indentations being his footprints or those of his horse.<ref name=radenkovic>Radenkovi<U+0107> 2001, pp.293<U+2013>7.</ref> He was also connected with other geographic objects, such as hills, glens, cliffs, caves, rivers, brooks, and groves, which he created or did something memorable at. They were often [[List of places named after Prince Marko|named after him]], so there are many [[Toponymy|toponyms]] from Istria in the west to Bulgaria in the east that are derived from the hero's name.<ref>Popovi<U+0107> 1988, pp.41<U+2013>2.</ref> In stories from Bulgaria and Macedonia, Marko had a sister who was as strong as he, and competed with him in throwing boulders.<ref name=radenkovic/>

Marko's wonder-horse was a gift from a ''vila'' by some legends, while a Serbian story gives the following account. He was looking for a horse that could bear him. To test a steed, he would grab him by the tail and sling him over his shoulder. Noticing a leprous piebald foal owned by some carters, he grabbed him by the tail, but could not move him at all. Marko bought and cured the foal, naming him <U+0160>arac (after ''<U+0161>ara'' "dapple"). He grew up into an enormously powerful horse, becoming the hero's inseparable companion.<ref name=karadzic>Karad<U+017E>i<U+0107> 1852, pp.345<U+2013>6, s.v. "<U+041C><U+0430><U+0440><U+043A><U+043E> <U+041A><U+0440><U+0430><U+0459><U+0435><U+0432><U+0438><U+045B>".</ref> A legend from Macedonia has it that Marko, on a ''vila'''s advice, captured a sick horse in a mountain and cured him. The patches on his skin that had been covered with crusts grew white hairs, so the hero's horse became piebald.<ref name=radenkovic/>

According to folk traditions the hero never died, but [[King in the mountain|lives on in a cave]], in a den covered with moss, or in an unknown land.<ref name=radenkovic/> A Serbian legend recounts that Marko once fought in a battle in which so many men were killed that the fighters and their horses ended up swimming in blood. He lifted up his hands towards heaven and said, "O God, what am I going to do now!" God took pity on Marko transporting him and <U+0160>arac into a cave, where the hero stuck his sabre into the rock and fell asleep. There is some moss in the cave, which <U+0160>arac eats bit by bit, while the sabre slowly comes out of the rock. When it falls down after it completely emerges, and the horse eats all of the moss, Marko will awake and reappear in the world.<ref name=karadzic/> Some people allegedly saw him after they descended into a deep pit, where he lived in a large house in front of which his horse was also seen. Others saw him in a faraway land, dwelling in a cave. According to a tradition from Macedonia, Marko drank of "eagle's water" which made him immortal, and he now accompanies [[Elijah|Prophet Elijah]] in heaven.<ref name=radenkovic/>

==In modern culture==

In the 19th century, Marko was the subject of multiple [[dramatization]]s. In 1831, the Hungarian drama ''Prince Marko'' was shown in [[Budim]], possibly written by [[Istv<U+00E1>n Balog]]<!-- [[:hu:Balog Istv<U+00E1>n (sz<U+00ED>n<U+00E9>sz)]] --><ref name=Sarenac26><U+0160>arenac 1996, p. 26</ref> and in 1838, the Hungarian drama ''Prince Marko <U+2013> Great Serbian Hero'' by [[Celesztin Perg<U+0151>]] was shown in [[Arad, Romania|Arad]].<ref name=Sarenac26/> In 1848, [[Jovan Sterija Popovi<U+0107>]] wrote the [[tragedy]] ''The Dream of Prince Marko'' which has the legend of sleeping Marko as its central [[Motif (narrative)|motif]]. [[Petar Preradovi<U+0107>]] wrote the [[drama]] ''Kraljevi<U+0107> Marko'' which glorifies the strength of the [[South Slavs]]. In 1863, [[Francesco Dall'Ongaro]] presented his Italian drama ''Resurrection of Prince Marko''.<ref name=Sarenac26/>
