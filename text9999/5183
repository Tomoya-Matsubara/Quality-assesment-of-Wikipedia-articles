'''Charles Maclaren''' ([[7 October]] [[1782]]&ndash;[[10 September]] [[1866]]) was a Scottish editor born in [[Ormiston]], [[Haddingtonshire]], the son of a farmer and cattle-dealer. He was almost entirely self-educated, and when a young man became a clerk in Edinburgh. In 1817, with others, he established ''[[The Scotsman]]'' newspaper in [[Edinburgh]] and at first acted as its editor. Offered a post as clerk in the custom house, he resigned his editorial position, resuming it in 1820, and resigning it again in 1845. In 1820 Maclaren was made editor of the sixth edition of the ''[[Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica]]''. From 1864-1866 he was president of the Geological Society of Edinburgh, in which city he died in 1866.
