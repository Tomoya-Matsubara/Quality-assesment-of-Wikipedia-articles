The initiative of library for Russian-speaking emigrants in Paris belonged to [[German Lopatin|German Alexandrovich Lopatin]],<ref>{{cite book|title=Solanus|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=eDaGAAAAIAAJ|year=2002|publisher=Slavonic and East European Group of SCONUL.|page=41}}</ref> a notable follower of [[Narodniks|Narodnik movement]]. The idea was not to create just a book depository, but the center for consolidation for revolutionary youth in France. Because Lopatin has no means for its foundation, he addressed to [[Ivan Turgenev|Ivan Sergeyevich Turgenev]], who lived in Paris at that time. Turgenev's personal books formed a basis for the new library. On February 15, 1875, Turgenev orginised a [[matinee]], which brought together many prominent cultural workers from Paris: [[Ilya Repin]], [[Vasily Polenov]], [[Sergey Makovsky]], [[Mark Antokolski]], and the Ambassodor of the Russian Empire in France [[Nikolay Alexeyevich Orlov]]. As a result there were collected 2000 [[franc]]s, which were used for buying books and rent the premises for the library. In [[1883]] Turgenev died, and the library was named after him.

Despite the financial difficulties, the library's holdings was continuously replenishing. It has 3500 volumes in 1900, 17000 -- in 1913, 50000 -- in 1925, and 100,000 -- in 1937. After [[1917]] [[Russian Revolution]] the library became one of the most principal centers of [[White <U+00E9>migr<U+00E9>]] culture. In [[1937]] the library got the splendid premises in XV-century mansion, the so-called ''H<U+00F4>tel Colbert'' in ''Rue de la B<U+00FB>cherie''. The library kept valuable rarities: the first printings of [[Voltaire]], [[Fran<U+00E7>ois de La Rochefoucauld]], [[Nikolay Karamzin]], [[Sudebnik of 1550|Sudebnik of tsar Ivan IV]] (with the comments of [[Vasily Tatishchev]]).

The library was practically destroyed during the [[World War II]]. In October, [[1940]], all books, pictures and portraits, busts were placed un 900 boxes and taken to unknown direction.{{cn}}

Turgenev Library was partially restored and reopened in 1959.<ref name="Marullo2002">{{cite book|author=Thomas Gaiton Marullo|title=Ivan Bunin: The Twilight of Emigr<U+00E9> Russia, 1934-1953 : a Portrait from Letters, Diaries, and Memoirs|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=mA1gAAAAMAAJ|date=1 January 2002|publisher=Ivan R.
