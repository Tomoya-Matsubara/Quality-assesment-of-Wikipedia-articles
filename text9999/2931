'''William Franklin Raynolds''' (March 17, 1820 <U+2013> October 18, 1894) was a [[U.S. Army]] officer, explorer, engineer, and a veteran of both the [[Mexican-American War]] and [[American Civil War]]s. Raynolds is best known for leading the 1859<U+2013>1860 [[Raynolds Expedition]] while serving as a member of the U.S. Army [[Corps of Topographical Engineers]].

During the 1840s and 1850s, and again after his participation in the American Civil War, Raynolds was the head engineer on numerous lighthouse construction projects. Raynolds oversaw riverway and harbor dredging projects intended to improve accessibility and navigation for shipping. As a cartographer, Raynolds participated in surveying and mapping areas of the Great Lakes and other regions. At least six lighthouses whose construction he oversaw are still standing. Some are still in use and of these, several are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

In 1848, during the American occupation of Mexico after the Mexican-American War, Raynolds and other U.S. Army personnel were the first to summit [[Pico de Orizaba]], the tallest mountain in Mexico, and inadvertently set what may have been the American alpine altitude record for the subsequent 50&nbsp;years. In 1859, Raynolds was placed in charge of the first [[U.S. Government]] sponsored expedition to venture into the upper [[Yellowstone River|Yellowstone]] region that was later to become [[Yellowstone National Park]]. Heavy winter snowpack in the [[Wind River Range]] of [[Wyoming]] prevented the expedition from reaching the Yellowstone Plateau. Consequently, the expedition was forced to diverge to the south and became the first U.S. Government expedition to cross what is known as [[Union Pass]], enter [[Jackson Hole]] and see the [[Teton Range]], now within [[Grand Teton National Park]].

During the American Civil War, Raynolds participated in the [[Battle of Cross Keys]] during the [[Valley Campaign]] of 1862, and a year later was in charge of fortifications in the defense of the military arsenal at [[Harpers Ferry, West Virginia]]. In 1865, Raynolds was promoted to the temporary rank of [[Brevet (military)|Brevet]] [[Brigadier General]] for meritorious service during the Civil War. He retired from the Corps of Engineers on March 17, 1884 with the rank of [[Colonel]], after a 40-year military career.

==Military career==
Initially appointed a Brevet [[Second Lieutenant]] in the 5th U.S. Infantry, within a few weeks Raynolds was transferred to the newly formed U.S. Army [[Corps of Topographical Engineers]].<ref name=corp1>{{cite web|title=The Beginnings to 1815|work=The U.S. Army Corp of Engineers: A Brief History|publisher=U.S. Army Corp of Engineers|url=http://www.usace.army.mil/About/History/BriefHistoryoftheCorps/Beginnings.aspx|accessdate=June 12, 2014}}</ref> The Topographical Engineers performed surveys and developed maps for army use until their merger with the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Corps of Engineers]] in 1863.<ref name=topo1>{{cite web|title=Roster of the Corps of Topographical Engineers|publisher=U S Corps of Topographical Engineers|url=http://www.topogs.org/MWofficr.html|accessdate=June 12, 2014}}</ref> Raynolds's first assignments from 1843 to 1844 were as an assistant topographical engineer involved in improving navigation on the [[Ohio River]] and surveying the northeastern boundary of the U.

===Mexican-American War===
[[File:Pico from Fortin 2 enhanced2.jpg|thumb|right|Pico de Orizaba was believed by Raynolds to be the tallest mountain in North America.]]
When war with Mexico seemed imminent, topographic engineers were sent to the border to assist with the army's preparations. Raynolds served in [[Winfield Scott]]'s [[Mexican-American War]] campaign which marched overland to [[Mexico City]] from the Gulf of Mexico seaport at [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Veracruz]]. After the war, the American army occupied Mexico City and the surrounding region. During the occupation, Raynolds and others set out to map and explore nearby mountains. Raynolds's party is credited with being the first to climb to the summit of [[Pico de Orizaba]]
({{coord|19|01|48|N|97|16|12|W}}) which at {{convert|18491|ft}}, is the tallest mountain in [[Mexico]] and third tallest in North America.<ref name=pb>{{cite peakbagger|pid=8049|name=Pico de Orizaba, Mexico

The following morning, May 10, 1848, about two dozen climbers made the final push to the top of the mountain, but only Raynolds and four to five others ended up summiting.<ref name=secor>{{cite book|last1=Secor|first1=R.J.|title=Mexico's Volcanoes: A Climbing Guide|date=April 1, 2001|publisher=The Mountaineers Books|isbn=978-0898867985|pages=28<U+2013>30|edition=3rd|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=XEqrPcMJ8vYC&pg=PA29&dq=Raynolds+climbs+pico+de+orizaba&hl=en&sa=X&ei=wKEDVPblH5CRgwS5mIBQ&ved=0CCIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Raynolds%20climbs%20pico%20de%20orizaba&f=false|accessdate=August 31, 2014}}</ref> This feat may have inadvertently set the American [[mountaineering]] altitude record for the subsequent 50&nbsp;years.<ref name=ortenburger>{{cite book|last=Ortenburger|first=Leigh N.|title=A Climber's Guide to the Teton Range|year=1996|publisher=The Mountaineers Books|isbn=978-0-89886-480-9|page=374|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Z-Y1tLw_YWgC&pg=PA374&dq=Reynolds+Peak+Teton+range&hl=en&sa=X&ei=VkNgUc7XMYT02QWL7oDABw&ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Reynolds%20Peak%20Teton%20range&f=false|author2=Reynold G.

As no higher peaks were known in North America at that time, Raynolds believed Pico de Orizaba was the tallest mountain on the continent.<ref name=secor/> The American achievement was in dispute until a 1851 French expedition discovered an American flag on the summit with the year 1848 carved in the flagpole.<ref name=secor/>

===Lighthouse engineer===
After returning from Mexico, Raynolds resumed mapping the U.S.<U+2014>Canada border which he had been surveying before the war, then embarked on a project to develop water resources for the nation's growing capital of [[Washington, D.C.]]. Raynolds then traveled the [[Great Lakes]] for several years surveying and mapping shorelines while identifying potential [[lighthouse]] locations.<ref name=beers1>{{cite web|last1=Beers|first1=Henry P.|title=A History of the U.

===Raynolds Expedition===
{{main|Raynolds Expedition}}
In early 1859 Raynolds was charged with leading an expedition into the [[Yellowstone National Park|Yellowstone]] region of [[Montana]] and [[Wyoming]] to determine, "as far as practicable, everything relating to&nbsp;... the Indians of the country, its agricultural and mineralogical resources&nbsp;... the navigability of its streams, its topographical features, and the facilities or obstacles which the latter present to the construction of rail or common roads&nbsp;...".<ref name=baldwin>{{cite book|last=Baldwin|first=Kenneth H.|title=Enchanted Enclosure:The Army Engineers and Yellowstone National Park|year=2005|publisher=University Press of the Pacific|isbn=978-1-4102-2180-3|url=http://www.cr.nps.gov/history/online_books/baldwin/chap2.htm|accessdate=July 13, 2014|chapter=II<U+2014> TERRA INCOGNITA: The Raynolds Expedition of 1860}}</ref> The expedition was carried out by a handful of technicians, including geologist/naturalist [[Ferdinand Vandeveer Hayden|F.V.

Henry E. Maynadier. The expedition was supported by a small infantry detachment of 30 and was funded with $60,000 by the U.S. Government. Experienced [[mountain man]] [[Jim Bridger]] was hired to guide the expedition.<ref name=baldwin/>

The expedition started in late May 1859 at [[St. Louis, Missouri]], from where the party was transported by two steamboats up the [[Missouri River]] to [[New Fort Pierre]], [[South Dakota]].<ref name=bighorn>{{cite web|title=Raynolds Expedition 1859<U+2013>60 and Bighorn Canyon Part 1|publisher=National Park Service|url=http://www.nps.gov/bica/historyculture/raynolds-expedition-1859-60-and-bighorn-canyon-part-1.htm|accessdate=June 13, 2014}}</ref> In late June the expedition left New Fort Pierre and headed overland to [[Fort Sarpy]] where they encountered the [[Crow Nation|Crow Indians]], described by Raynolds as, "a small band compared to their neighbors, but are famous warriors, and, according to common report, seldom fail to hold their own with any of the tribes unless greatly outnumbered."<ref name=raynolds>{{cite book|last1=Raynolds|first1=William F.|title=Report on the Exploration of the Yellowstone River|date=October 1, 2008|publisher=Kessinger Publishing, LLC|isbn=978-1437066241|pages=50<U+2013>51|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=guIRAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA51&dq=Report+on+the+exploration+of+the+Yellowstone+river+crows+warriors+extermination&hl=en&sa=X&ei=m7QHVMm6DdL6oQSa2IG4Aw&ved=0CBQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Report%20on%20the%20exploration%20of%20the%20Yellowstone%20river%20crows%20warriors%20extermination&f=false|accessdate=September 3, 2014}}</ref> Raynolds was impressed with the Crow chief Red Bear, and after assuring him that the expedition meant to only pass through Crow Indian territory and not linger, the Crows gave the expedition seven horses in trade for a few presents.<ref name=raynolds/>

Raynolds divided his expedition, sending a smaller detachment under Maynadier to explore the [[Tongue River (Montana)|Tongue River]], a major tributary of the [[Yellowstone River]]. James D. Hutton and Zephyr Recontre, the expedition's [[Siouan languages|Sioux]] interpreter, took a side trip to locate an isolated rock formation that had been seen from great distance by a previous expedition in 1857. Hutton was the first person of European descent to reach the rock formation in northeastern Wyoming, later known as [[Devils Tower]]; Raynolds never elaborated on this event in great detail, mentioning it only in passing.<ref name=journal/><ref name=tower>{{cite web|last=Mattison|first=Ray H.|title=The First Fifty Years - Early Exploration|work=History and Culture|publisher=National Park Service|url=http://www.nps.gov/deto/historyculture/early-exploration.htm|accessdate=June 15, 2014|year=1955}}</ref> By September 2, 1859, Raynolds's detachment had followed the Yellowstone River to the confluence with the [[Bighorn River]].<ref name=bighorn/> The two parties under Raynolds and Maynadier reunited on October 12, 1859 and wintered at Deer Creek Station, on the [[Platte River]] in central Wyoming.<ref name=journal/>

In May 1860, the expedition recommenced their explorations, with Raynolds leading a party north up the [[Wind River (Wyoming)|Wind River]], hoping to cross the mountains at [[Togwotee Pass]], a [[mountain pass]] expedition guide Jim Bridger knew about. Meanwhile, Maynadier led his party back to the Bighorn River region. The plan was for the two parties to reunite on June 30, 1860 at [[Three Forks, Montana]], so they could make observations of a total [[solar eclipse]] forecast for July 18, 1860.<ref name=baldwin/><ref name=journal/> Hampered by towering basaltic cliffs and deep snows, Raynolds attempted for over a week to reconnoiter to the top of Togwotee Pass, but was forced south due to the June 30 deadline for reaching Three Forks. Bridger then led the party south over another pass that Raynolds named [[Union Pass]], to the west of which lay [[Jackson Hole]] and the [[Teton Range]]. From there the expedition went southwest, crossing the southern Teton Range at [[Teton Pass]] and entering [[Pierre's Hole]] in present day [[Idaho]].<ref name=journal/> Though Raynolds and his party managed to get to Three Forks at the scheduled date, Maynadier's party was several days late, and the planned small detachment that was supposed to head due north to observe the solar eclipse was cancelled due to lack of time.<ref name=baldwin/> Heading east, the reunited expedition recrossed the [[Rocky Mountains]] and traveled via steamboat downstream to [[Omaha, Nebraska]] where the expedition members were disbanded in October 1860.<ref name=journal/>

A combination of failure to reach the fabled sights of the Yellowstone region as well as the outbreak of the war relegated the Raynold's Expedition to near obscurity, but his map was in high demand and was published in 1864.<ref name=baldwin/> Botanical specimens, fossils and geological items that were collected during the expedition were sent to the [[Smithsonian Institution]] but were not studied in detail until after the war. Much of the artwork created by Hutton and especially Sch<U+00F6>nborn was lost, though several of Sch<U+00F6>nborn's [[Chromolithography|chromolithograph]]s appeared in F.V. Hayden's 1883 report that was submitted after later expeditions.<ref name=journal/>

===American Civil War===
Raynolds returned to Washington at the outbreak of the war, and was made chief topographic engineer of the [[Department of Virginia and North Carolina#Department of Virginia|Department of Virginia]] in July, 1861. The army lacked adequate maps for military use, so Raynolds and his team of engineers began to survey and draw up maps of [[Virginia]] and the region of the western portion of that state that had remained loyal to the Union and would become the new state of  [[West Virginia]] during the war. In 1862, Raynolds was engaged with [[John C. Fr<U+00E9>mont|John C. Fr<U+00E9>mont's]] Mountain Department in chasing [[Stonewall Jackson]] up the [[Shenandoah Valley]] and participated in the [[Battle of Cross Keys]].<ref name=cullum1171/>

Raynolds spent two months recovering from illness after the [[Valley Campaign]], then was assigned as chief engineer of Middle Department and [[VIII Corps (Union Army)|VIII Corps]] in January 1863. Promoted [[Major (United States)|Major]] in the Corps of Engineers, from March 1863 Raynolds found himself in charge of the defenses of vital [[Harpers Ferry, West Virginia]] during [[Robert E. Lee|Robert E. Lee's]] second [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] invasion of the north during the [[Gettysburg Campaign]].<ref name=cullum1171/>

As the end of war approached and hostilities with the [[Sioux Indians]] loomed, Raynolds's knowledge and experiences of the Great Lakes region became more important to the army than his command of the fortifications of Harpers Ferry. Consequently in April 1864 Raynolds returned to the Great Lakes as superintending engineer of surveys and lighthouses and saw no further combat for the rest of his career.<ref name=cullum1171/>

===Post war career===
Raynolds was brevetted [[Brigadier General]] for his Civil War service and promoted to [[Lieutenant Colonel]] in the Corps of Engineers in 1865. After the Civil War, the Corps of Engineers undertook a program of river and harbor improvements. Raynolds supervised the dredging and improvement of navigation on the [[Arkansas River|Arkansas]], [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] and Missouri Rivers. He was involved in supervision of harbor dredging and construction in [[Buffalo, New York]], Harbor of Refuge in [[New Buffalo, Michigan]], [[Erie Harbor]] in [[Erie, Pennsylvania]], and the river harbors of St. Louis, Missouri and [[Alton, Illinois]].<ref name=cullum1171/> Raynolds sited and oversaw the installation of dozens of lighthouses in the Great Lakes area where he served as the superintending engineer from 1864 to 1870.<ref name=cullums2>{{cite book|last=Cullum|first=George W.|title=Biographical Register of the Officers|publisher=Applewood Books|isbn=978-1429021296|pages=158<U+2013>159|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Plg1epvs3aUC&pg=PA158|accessdate=August 9, 2014|date=October 27, 2009}}</ref> After that Raynolds supervised lighthouse construction along the [[Gulf Coast]] and again in New Jersey where he managed the construction of the [[Hereford Inlet Light]]house in 1874<ref name=hereford>{{cite web|title=Hereford Inlet, NJ|url=http://www.lighthousefriends.com/light.asp?ID=388|publisher=Lighthousefriends.com|accessdate=July 13, 2014}}</ref> and the original [[New Castle Range Front Light]] and [[New Castle Range Rear Light]]houses in 1876.<ref name=newcastle>{{cite web|title=New Castle Range, DE|url=http://www.lighthousefriends.com/light.asp?ID=881|publisher=Lighthousefriends.com|accessdate=July 13, 2014}}</ref> He continued serving with the Corps of Engineers in a variety of harbor and river navigational improvements until his retirement in 1884.<ref name=cullum1171/>

Though overshadowed by the Civil War, the Raynolds Expedition produced maps that were used by subsequent explorers to the greater Yellowstone region.<ref name=baldwin/> Raynolds also located suitable wagon routes in the Bighorn Basin region and was able to help narrow down the most appropriate routes for a future transcontinental railroad. The Raynolds Expedition also determined that few if any riverways would be suitable for steamboats due to numerous rapids and steep downstream gradients that would prevent upstream movement by steamboats.<ref name=raynolds>{{cite book|last1=Raynolds|first1=William Franklin|title=Report on the Exploration of the Yellowstone River|date=1868|publisher=U.S. Army Corp of Engineers, Government Printing Office|isbn=978-1437066241|pages=12<U+2013>18|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=guIRAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA12&dq=report+on+the+exploration+of+the+yellowstone+river&hl=en&sa=X&ei=8gsCVP6CJIO4ggSx44Fo&ved=0CCAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=report%20on%20the%20exploration%20of%20the%20yellowstone%20river&f=false|accessdate=August 30, 2014}}</ref> A number of lighthouses Raynolds designed or supervised the construction of are still in use and several are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cape May Point State Park|publisher=State of New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection|url=http://www.state.nj.us/dep/parksandforests/parks/capemay.html|accessdate=August 9, 2014}}</ref>
