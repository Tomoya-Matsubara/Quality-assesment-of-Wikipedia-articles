'''Patroon Creek''' is a [[stream]] in [[Albany County, New York|Albany County]], [[New York]], [[United States]] and is a tributary of the [[Hudson River]] which flows south to [[New York Harbor]] and the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. The creek's [[source (river or stream)|source]] is [[Rensselaer Lake]] in the western section of the [[City (New York)|city]] of [[Albany, New York|Albany]] and flows along the northern border of said city with the [[Town (New York)|town]] of [[Colonie, New York|Colonie]] to its [[Mouth (river)|mouth]] at the Hudson River. The creek received its name from the [[patroon]] of [[Rensselaerswyck]].<ref name=Bulletin/>

==History==
Patroon Creek, starting with [[Henry Hudson]]'s discovery of the Hudson River, was a part of the [[United Netherlands|Dutch]] colony [[New Netherland]] and the [[patroonship]] of Rensselaerswyck, founded in 1630. On the 1632 [[Map of Rensselaerswyck]] the mouth of the Patroon Creek is labeled as "Bloommaert's Burt",<ref>{{cite book |title=History of Rensselaer Co., New York with Illustrations and Biographical Sketches of its Prominent Men and Pioneers |last=Sylvester |first=Nathaniel Bartlett |location=[[Philadelphia]] |publisher=Everts & Peck |year=1880}}</ref> and Patroon Creek gained the name of Bloomaert's [[Kill (body of water)|Kill]], ''kill'' being the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] word for creek or stream.<ref name=townhistorian/> Another early name for the kill was Fifth Kill, it being the fifth (and final) kill (counting from the south) in the colonial Albany area.<ref name=Bi/> Early settlers in the 17th century included Gerrit Thensz de Reux who settled a farm on the Blommaerts Kill in 1632, and Rutger Jacobsz in 1645 and Adrian Hybertsz in 1647 who settled just north of the kill. In 1654 Jacob Jansz Flodder was the highest bidder for establishing grist and sawmills on the kill and Barent Pietersz Koeymans and Teunis Cornelisz van Spitsbergen obtained a lease for a sawmill higher up the kill.<ref name="townhistorian">{{cite web | title = http://www.colonie.org/historian/earlyhistory.html | url = http://www.colonie.org/historian/earlyhistory.html | date = 1999-11-01 | title = Early History of the Town of Colonie | publisher = Town of Colonie, NY}}</ref> In 1666 [[Jeremias van Rensselaer]], the fourth [[patroon]], established several barns and mills along the kill on what is now Tivoli Street.<ref>{{cite web | title = North Albany | publisher = Albany Institute of History and Art | accessdate = 2010-07-25 | url = http://www.albanyinstitute.org/info/exhibits/city%20neighborhoods/north%20albany/North%20Albany.htm}}</ref> The Old Manor House was also built by the patroon just north of the creek near its mouth with the Hudson in 1666.<ref name=Bi/><ref>{{cite news | publisher = Hearst Newspapers | work = Times Union (Albany) | title = Dongan, Schuyler, Livingston: An Early Trio of Influence | page = T18 | author = Shepard, Judy | url = http://albarchive.merlinone.net/mweb/wmsql.wm.request?oneimage&imageid=5445716 | date = 1986-07-06 | accessdate = 2010-07-25}}</ref>

In 1844 the railroad between Albany and [[Schenectady, New York|Schenectady]] east of Fuller Road was moved north from the central part of the city to the Tivoli Hollow Line which ran across the northern border of the city along Patroon Creek and through [[West Albany, New York|West Albany]]. The [[Albany and Schenectady Railroad]] which owned this line was merged with nine other railroads as the [[New York Central Railroad]] (NYCRR) in 1853,<ref>{{cite web | title = Steve's Railroad Pages; Local Information | accessdate = 2010-02-07 | author = Steve Sconfienza | url = http://members.localnet.com/~docsteve/railroad/local.htm}}</ref> and work soon began on the establishment of a large rail yard, on {{convert|250|acre|km2}} purchased in 1854 in West Albany.<ref>{{cite book | page = 479 | title = The History of the City of Albany, New York | author = Arthur James Weise | publisher = E.H.

In 1845 the Albany Waterworks Company purchased from the patroon [[Stephen van Rensselaer]] a portion of the Patroon Creek for use as a water supply. The Albany Waterworks was a private corporation and was replaced by a municipal water supply in 1850 which then purchased all the water sources from the Albany Waterworks. In 1851 the Patroon Creek was dammed by the city roughly {{convert|6|mi|km}} from [[Albany City Hall]] where three streams met to form the creek.<ref name=Bi/> The lake formed was named Rensselaer Lake in honor of Stephen van Rensselaer.<ref name="Bulletin">{{cite book | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=1IEnAAAAMAAJ&pg=RA2-PA49&dq=rensselaer+lake&hl=en&ei=YfRITPyXBsL58AbJw42SDw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CCkQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&q=rensselaer%20lake&f=false | page = 49 | title= Bulletin, Issues 171-176 | publisher = New York State Museum}}</ref> Water from the lake passed through a {{convert|4|ft|m|adj=on}} tall and {{convert|4|mi|km|adj=on}} long brick pipe to the Bleecker Reservoir (now [[Bleecker Stadium]]) where the water was used for the portion of the city west from [[Pearl Street (Albany)|Pearl Street]] to [[Lark Street]]. Also in 1851 dams were thrown across the lower portion of Patroon Creek to form the Lower and Upper Tivoli Lakes (upper for storage, lower for distribution), the water being from the tributaries that join the Patroon east of the Rensselaer Lake dam.<ref name=Bi/> Other reservoirs would be constructed on the creek and its tributaries, the Patroon Creek Reservoir at Russell Road and another north of there on the Sand Creek also next to Russell Road.<ref>{{cite book | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=ynpLAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA157&dq=patroon+creek+reservoir+russell+road&hl=en&ei=A9dMTJDEC4L58AaGzek2&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CDMQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q&f=false | volume = 2 | issue = 41 | title = Forty-First Annual Report of the State Department of Health for the Year Ending December 31, 1920 | publisher = J.B.

From the 1950s to 1998 Mercury Refining Company had a plant along an unnamed tributary to the Patroon Creek. Since 1983 the site has been on the [[Superfund]] pollution clean-up list. Several former customers of the plant including [[National Grid plc|National Grid]], [[Eveready Battery Company|Eveready]], and [[Union Carbide]] put up over $4 million for the clean-up being supervised by the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA).<ref>{{cite news | url = http://albarchive.merlinone.net/mweb/wmsql.wm.request?oneimage&imageid=9237239 | publisher = Hearst Newspapers | work = Times Union (Albany) | title = $4 Million Ready for Mercury Removal | page = D4 | author = Nearing, Brian | date = 2010-01-07 | accessdate = 2010-07-25}}</ref> Another industrial site that has polluted the Patroon Creek and its watershed is a factory owned by NL Industries (formerly National Lead). The factory recycled [[depleted uranium]] into [[armor-piercing shot and shell]].

Prior to the establishment of Albany's modern sewer system with treatment plants in the 1970s the municipality routinely had sewer pipes outflow into the creeks around the city. In 2000 several office buildings around Everett Road were found to still be dumping into the Patroon Creek and the pipes were corked and the properties connected to the municipal sewer system.<ref>{{cite news | publisher = Hearst Newspapers | work = Times Union (Albany) | accessdate = 2010-07-25 | url = http://albarchive.merlinone.net/mweb/wmsql.wm.request?oneimage&imageid=6024819 | date = 2000-01-28 | page = B5 | title = Jennings Vow to Aid in Tributary's Cleanup | author = Cappiello, Dina}}</ref>

In the 1970s the Patroon Creek was diverted around Tivoli Lake and the lake was dredged. In 2010 plans have begun to return the creek through the lake in order to increase the oxygen content and circulation of the lake, along with using the wetlands of the lake as a natural filter to clean the Patroon Creek. This plan has been opposed by groups representing the area around Tivoli Lake who fear that [[heavy metals]] such as [[mercury (element)|mercury]] and depleted uranium will be deposited in the lake and preserve.<ref>{{cite news | publisher = Hearst Newspapers | work = Times Union (Albany) | accessdate = 2010-07-25 | title = Tivoli Lake Revival OK'd | author = Carleo-Evangelist, Jordan | page = B7 | date = 2009-06-02 | url = http://albarchive.merlinone.net/mweb/wmsql.wm.request?oneimage&imageid=8139743}}</ref>

==Geography==
The Patroon Creek is {{convert|6.2|mi|km}} long from a grate at the eastern end of Rensselaer Lake to a culvert that empties into the Hudson River. About 1/3 of the creek has been moved from its original course and/or buried in culverts since the 19th century to make way for railroads and highways. The creek passes through three nature preserves, the [[Albany Pine Bush]] at its source, the Tivoli Park Preserve, and the Corning Preserve at its mouth.<ref>{{cite web | title = Effectiveness of Riparian Wetlands in Improving Water Quality in an Urban Stream | author = Vanderlan, Christine M. | year = 2008 | publisher = Hudson River Foundation | url = http://www.hudsonriver.org/ls/reports/Polgar_Vanderlan_TP_07_07_final.pdf}}</ref> The creek's watershed is roughly {{convert|5000|acres|ha}}.<ref name="Bi">{{cite book | title = Bi-Centennial History of Albany.
