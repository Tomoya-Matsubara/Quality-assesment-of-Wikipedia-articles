The Ellis Act "was adopted by the California Legislature in 1985 after the California Supreme Court ruled that landlords do not have the right to [[evict]] tenants to go out of the business of being a landlord".<ref>[http://www.beyondchron.org/news/index.php?itemid=1265 BeyondChron: San Francisco's Alternative Online Daily News <U+00BB> New Study Calls for Ellis Act Reform<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Municipalities can regulate the Ellis Act eviction process to some extent.
