'''Stephen Joseph Harper''' (born [[April 30]], [[1959]]) is the 22nd and current [[Prime Minister of Canada]] and leader of the [[Conservative Party of Canada]]. He became Prime Minister after leading the Conservatives to a [[minority government]] win in the [[Canadian federal election, 2006|January 2006 federal election]], which ended more than twelve years of [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] government.

Harper has been the [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) for the [[riding]] of [[Calgary Southwest]] in [[Alberta]] since 2002, having previously served as the MP for [[Calgary West]] from 1993 to 1997. According to Canadian protocol, as Prime Minister, he is styled "[[The Right Honourable]]" for life. 

As one of the founding members of the [[Reform Party of Canada|Reform Party]], he ended his first stint as an MP to head the [[National Citizens Coalition]]. In 2002, Stephen Harper succeeded [[Stockwell Day]] as leader of the [[Canadian Alliance]] and returned to Parliament as Leader of the Opposition. In 2003, he successfully reached an agreement with [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative]] leader [[Peter MacKay]] to merge the Canadian Alliance with the Progressive Conservative Party to form the Conservative Party of Canada. He was elected as the party's first non-interim leader in March 2004. 

==Background==
Stephen Harper was born in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]]. He is the eldest of three sons of Margaret Johnston and Joseph Harper (1927&ndash;2003), an [[accounting|accountant]] who worked with [[Imperial Oil]]. Harper attended [[John G. Althouse Middle School]], and [[Richview Collegiate Institute]], a [[high school]], both in Central [[Etobicoke]], while living at 57 Princess Anne Crescent. He graduated in 1978 as the top student of his graduating year with a 95.7% average, and represented his high school on the TV quiz and trivia show [[Reach for the Top]].<ref name=ReachForTheTop>O'Connor, Naoibh, "[http://www.vancourier.com/issues04/064104/news/064104nn11.html 'Nerds' tops in Canada]", ''The Vancouver Courier'', August 5, 2004, accessed on October 9, 2006 </ref> Harper briefly studied at the [[University of Toronto]] before travelling to [[Edmonton, Alberta|Edmonton]], where he found employment in the [[oil industry|oil and gas industry]] as a [[computer programmer]] in his early twenties. He later attended the [[University of Calgary]], receiving a [[Master's degree]] in [[economics]]. Harper is the first prime minister since [[Lester B. Pearson]] not to have attended [[law school]].  His links to the University remain strong, and he has been a frequent lecturer there.

Harper married [[Laureen Teskey]] in 1993. They have two children: Benjamin, born in 1996, and Rachel, born in 1999.  Harper is the third Prime Minister, after [[Pierre Trudeau]] and [[John Turner]], to send their children to [[Rockcliffe Park Public School]], a public school in [[Ottawa]].

Harper has several hobbies and has participated in many artistic endeavours. He is an avid fan of [[ice hockey]] and of the [[Calgary Flames]], although in a recent [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] game, cameras had caught him raising his arms after a Toronto goal which raised questions by hockeys fans. His son Ben was wearing a Maple Leaf jersey at the game.<ref> {{cite news | author = CTV News | title = PM's hockey loyalties questioned after Leafs goal | publisher = CTV | url = http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20061005/harper_hockey_0610/20061005/ | date = October 5, 2006 }} </ref>

==Political beginnings==
[[Image:steveharper-outlook.jpg|left|thumb|350px|Stephen Harper, pictured right, here with young Progressive Conservatives, in 1985. ]]

Harper became involved in politics as a member of his high school's [[Young Liberals of Canada|Young Liberals Club]].  He later changed his political allegiance because of the [[Pierre Trudeau|Trudeau]] [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] government's [[National Energy Program]] (NEP), which he thought was harmful to Alberta's [[energy industry]]. He became chief aide to [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative]] MP [[Jim Hawkes]] in 1985, but became disillusioned with both the party and the government of [[Brian Mulroney]]. Harper was especially critical of the Mulroney government's [[fiscal policy]], and its inability to fully revoke the NEP until 1986. He left the PC Party in 1986.

He was then recommended by Western economist Bob Mansell to [[Preston Manning]], the founder and leader of the Reform Party of Canada.  Harper impressed Manning, who invited him to participate in the party.  Harper gave an important speech at Reform's 1987 founding convention in [[Winnipeg, Manitoba|Winnipeg]].  He became the Reform Party's Chief Policy Officer, and he played a major role in drafting the 1988 election platform.  He is credited with creating Reform's campaign slogan, "The West wants in!"

Harper ran for the [[Canadian House of Commons]] in the [[Canadian federal election, 1988|1988 federal election]], appearing on the ballot as '''Steve Harper''' in [[Calgary West]].  He lost by a wide margin to Hawkes, his former employer.  The Reform Party did not win any seats in this election, although party candidate [[Deborah Grey]] was elected as the party's first MP in a [[by-election]] shortly thereafter.  Harper became Grey's executive assistant, and was her chief adviser and speechwriter until 1993.<ref>Geoff White, "Ottawa will be hearing from Reform MP", ''Calgary Herald'', [[21 April]] [[1989]], A5.</ref>  He remained prominent in the Reform Party's national organization in his role as policy chief, encouraging the party to expand beyond its Western base and arguing that strictly regional parties were at risk of being taken over by radical elements.<ref>Paul Gessell, "The "other' parties are picking up big followings", ''Kitchener-Waterloo Record'', [[26 October]] [[1990]], A9.</ref>  He delivered a speech at the Reform Party's 1991 national convention which condemned extremist views.<ref>George Oake, "Reform Party tries to avoid appearance of extremism", ''Toronto Star'', [[6 April]] [[1991]], A12.</ref>

Harper's relationship with Manning became strained in 1992, as a result of conflicting strategies over the [[Charlottetown Accord]].  Harper opposed the Accord on principle for ideological reasons, while Manning was initially more open to compromise.  Harper also criticized Manning's decision to hire [[Rick Anderson]] as an adviser, believing that Anderson was not sufficiently committed to the Reform Party's principles.<ref>William Johnson, ''Stephen Harper and the Future of Canada'', (Toronto: McClelland and Stewart, 2005), pp. 179-183.</ref>  He resigned as policy chief in October 1992.  

Harper stood for office again in the [[Canadian federal election, 1993|1993 federal election]], and defeated Jim Hawkes amid a significant Reform breakthrough in Western Canada. His campaign likely benefited from a $50,000 print and television campaign organized by the [[National Citizens Coalition]] against Hawkes, although the NCC did not endorse Harper directly.<ref>Kenneth Whyte, "The right-wingers duke it out in the Calgary West corral", ''Globe and Mail'', [[2 October]] [[1993]], D2.</ref>

==Reform MP==
Harper emerged a prominent member of the Reform Party caucus, and earned respect even from political opponents for his intellect and ideological commitment. Author [[Mordecai Richler]] once described him as the "one MP of substance" in the party.<ref>Mordecai Richler, "We're in trouble: There isn't even an illusion of choice in the upcoming federal election", ''Kitchener-Waterloo Record'', [[22 April]] [[1997]], A11.</ref>

Harper was active on [[constitution]]al issues during his first term in parliament, and played a prominent role in drafting the Reform Party's strategy for the [[1995 Quebec referendum]]. A long-standing opponent of centralized [[Federalism#Federalism in Canada|federalism]], he stood with Preston Manning in [[Montreal]] to introduce a twenty-point plan to "decentralize and modernize" Canada in the event of a "no" victory.<ref>Neville Nankivell, "Reform's voice will grow louder", ''Financial Post'', [[31 October]] [[1995]], p. 23.</ref> Harper later argued that the "no" side's narrow [[plurality]] was a worst-case scenario, in that no-one had won a mandate for change.<ref>"Harris joins other leaders in calling for change", ''Hamilton Spectator'', [[31 October]] [[1995]], A1.</ref>

Although not associated with the Reform Party's radical wing, Harper expressed [[social conservatism|socially conservative]] views on some issues. In 1994, he opposed plans by federal [[Minister of Justice (Canada)|Justice Minister]] [[Allan Rock]] to introduce spousal benefits for [[same-sex couple]]s. Citing the recent failure of a similar initiative in [[Ontario]], he was quoted as saying, "What I hope they learn is not to get into it. There are more important social and economic issues, not to mention the unity question".<ref>Marta Gold, "Same-sex fight going to Ottawa", ''Hamilton Spectator'', [[10 June]] [[1994]], A3.</ref> Harper also spoke against the possibility of the [[Canadian Human Rights Commission]] or the [[Supreme Court of Canada|Supreme Court]] changing federal policy in these and other matters.<ref>Joan Crockett, "Robinson lays equality complaint", ''Hamilton Spectator'', [[22 June]] [[1994]], A12.</ref> 

At the Reform Party's 1994 policy convention, Harper was part of a small minority of delegates who voted against restricting the definition of marriage to "the union of one man and one woman".<ref>Edward Greenspon, "Stephen Harper: a neo-con in a land of liberals", ''Globe and Mail'', [[23 March]] [[2002]], A17.</ref> He actually opposed both [[Same-sex marriage in Canada|same-sex marriage]] and mandated benefits for same-sex couples, but argued that political parties should refrain from taking official positions on these and other issues of conscience.<ref>Johnson, ''Stephen Harper'', p. 222.</ref>

Harper was the only Reform MP to vote for a bill establishing the [[Canadian gun registry]] at second reading stage in 1995, although he voted against it at third reading. He made his initial decision after concluding that a majority of his constituents supported the measure, but changed his mind after deciding there was substantial opposition.<ref>Dan Lett, "Outlaw Grits say no to party's gun bill", ''Winnipeg Free Press'', [[6 April]] [[1995]] and "Gun bill advances despite three rebels", ''Hamilton Spectator'', [[6 April]] [[1995]], A6; David Vienneau, "Torn MPs face high noon on gun law", ''Toronto Star'', [[13 June]] [[1995]], A21.</ref> It was reported in April 1995 that some Progressive Conservatives opposed to [[Jean Charest]]'s leadership wanted to remove both Charest and Manning, and unite the Reform and Progressive Conservative parties under Harper's leadership.<ref>Susan Delacourt, "Charest, Manning dismiss reports of parties' merging", ''Globe and Mail'', [[4 April]] [[1995]], A5.</ref>

Despite his prominent position in the party, Harper's relationship with the Reform Party leadership was frequently strained.  In early 1994, he criticized a party decision to establish a personal expense account for Preston Manning at a time when other Reform MPs had been asked to forego parliamentary [[employee benefit|perquisites]].<ref>Geoffrey York, "Reform MPs snarl at party rebuke", ''Globe and Mail'', [[8 April]] [[1994]], A4.</ref> His criticism proved divisive in the party, and he was formally rebuked by the Reform executive council despite winning support from some MPs. His relationship with Manning grew increasingly fractious in the mid-1990s, and he pointedly declined to express any opinion on Manning's leadership during a 1996 interview.<ref>Edward Greenspon, "Reform's renewal off to slow start", ''Globe and Mail'', [[1 August]] [[1996]], A4; Edward Greenspon, "Manning seeks to repeat party's surge", ''Globe and Mail'', [[2 August]] [[1996]], A4.</ref>  This friction was indictative of a fundamental divide between the two men: Harper was strongly committed to conservative principles and opposed Manning's inclinations toward [[populism]], which he saw as leading to compromise on core ideological matters.<ref>Kenneth Whyte, "That Manning and Harper would clash has always been a safe bet", ''Globe and Mail'', [[9 April]] [[1994]], D2; [http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20060114.wxibbitson14/BNStory/specialNewTory2006/national/?pageRequested=all John Ibbitson, "Who is Stephen Harper?"], ''Globe and Mail'', [[14 January]] [[2006]], online edition.</ref>

These tensions culminated in late 1996 when Harper announced that he would not be a candidate in the [[Canadian federal election, 1997|next federal election]]. He resigned his parliamentary seat on [[January 14]], [[1997]], the same day that he was appointed as a vice-president of the National Citizens Coalition (NCC), a conservative think-tank and advocacy group.<ref>"Stephen Harper named A NCC Vice-President", ''Canada NewsWire'', [[14 January]] [[1997]], 10:51 report.</ref>  He was promoted to NCC president later in the year.  

In April 1997, Harper suggested that the Reform Party was drifting toward social conservatism and ignoring the principles of economic conservatism.<ref>Thomas Walkom, No title [Second of Five Parts], ''Toronto Star'', [[6 April]] [[1997]], A1.</ref> The Liberal Party won a second majority government in the [[Canadian federal election, 1997|1997 federal election]], while Reform made only modest gains.

==Out of parliament==
{{main|Stephen Harper out of Parliament}}
===1997-2000===

Soon after leaving parliament, Harper and [[Tom Flanagan (political scientist)|Tom Flanagan]] co-authored an opinion piece entitled "Our Benign Dictatorship", which argued that the Liberal Party only retained power through a dysfunctional political system and a divided opposition. Harper and Flanagan argued that national conservative governments between 1917 and 1993 were founded on temporary alliances between Western populists and Quebec nationalists, and were unable to govern because of their fundamental contradictions. The authors called for an alliance of Canada's conservative parties, and suggested that meaningful political change might require electoral reforms such as [[proportional representation]]. "Our Benign Dictatorship" also commended [[Conrad Black]]'s purchase of the [[Southam]] newspaper chain, arguing that his stewardship would provide for a "pluralistic" editorial view to counter the "monolithically liberal and [[feminism|feminist]]" approach of the previous management.<ref>[http://www.nextcity.com/main/town/6dictat.htm Stephen Harper and Tom Flanagan, "Our Benign Dictatorship"], ''Next City'', Winter 1997.</ref>

Harper considered campaigning for the Progressive Conservative Party leadership in 1998, after Jean Charest left federal politics. Among those encouraging his candidacy were senior aides to Ontario [[Premier of Ontario|Premier]] [[Mike Harris]], including [[Tony Clement]] and [[Tom Long]].

===2000-2001===

When the United Alternative created the [[Canadian Alliance]] in 2000 as a successor party to Reform, Harper predicted that [[Stockwell Day]] would defeat Preston Manning for the new party's leadership. He expressed serious reservations about Day's abilities, however, and accused him of "[making] adherence to his social views a [[litmus test (politics)|litmus test]] to determine whether you're in the party or not".<ref>Tim Harper, "Bible belts", ''Toronto Star'', [[17 June]] [[2000]], p. 1.</ref> Harper endorsed [[Tom Long]] for the leadership, arguing that Long was best suited to take support from the Progressive Conservative Party.<ref>"That sound you hear is the shifting of conservative ground", [[21 April]] [[2000]], ''Globe and Mail'', A12.</ref> When Day placed first on the first ballot, Harper said that the Canadian Alliance was shifting "more towards being a party of the [[religious right]]".<ref>Paul Adams, "Front-runner rides tide of religious conservatism", ''Globe and Mail'', [[26 June]] [[2000]], A1.</ref>

After [[Pierre Elliot Trudeau]]'s death in 2000, Harper wrote an editorial criticizing Trudeau's policies as they affected Western Canada. He wrote that Trudeau "embraced the fashionable causes of his time, with variable enthusiasm and differing results", but "took a pass" on the issues that "truly defined his century".<ref>Stephen Harper, "On second thought", ''National Post'', [[5 October]] [[2000]], A18.</ref> Harper subsequently accused Trudeau of promoting "unabashed [[socialism]]", and argued that Canadian governments between 1972 and 2002 had restricted [[economic growth]] through "state corporatism".<ref>Stephen Harper, "Get the state out of the economy", ''National Post'', [[8 February]] [[2002]], A14.</ref>

Harper and the NCC endorsed a [[private school]] [[tax credit]] proposed by Ontario's [[Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario|Progressive Conservative]] government in 2001, arguing that it would "save about $7,000 for each student who does not attend a [[trade union|union]]-run [[public school]]". [[Minister of Education (Ontario)|Education Minister]] [[Janet Ecker]] criticized this statement, arguing that her government's intent was not attempting to save money at the expense of public education.<ref>Richard Mackie, "School tax-credit plan hailed as a money saver", ''Globe and Mail'', [[19 June]] [[2001]], A5.</ref>

Day's leadership of the Canadian Alliance became increasingly troubled throughout the summer of 2001, as several party MPs called for his resignation. In June, the ''[[National Post]]'' newspaper reported that former Reform MP [[Ian McClelland]] was organizing a possible leadership challenge on Harper's behalf.<ref>Sheldon Alberts, "Harper mounts campaign to lead the right: Behind the scenes", ''National Post'', [[30 June]] [[2001]], A06.</ref> Harper announced his resignation from the NCC presidency in August 2001, to prepare a campaign.<ref>National Citizen's Coalition, "Stephen Harper to Step Down as NCC President", ''Canada NewsWire'', [[13 August]] [[2001]], 13:43 report.</ref>

==Canadian Alliance leadership==	 

Day bowed to pressure, and called a new Canadian Alliance leadership race for 2002. He later announced that he would be a candidate to succeed himself. Harper emerged as Day's main rival, and declared his own candidacy on [[December 3]], [[2001]].  He eventually won the support of at least twenty-eight Alliance MPs,<ref>"Number 28 for Harper", ''Canada NewsWire'', [[6 March]] [[2002]], 13:11 report.</ref> including [[Scott Jeffrey Reid|Scott Reid]], [[James Rajotte]]<ref>"Six Alliance MPs declare or reaffirm support for Harper's leadership bid", ''Canadian Press'', [[7 December]] [[2001]], 17:55 report.</ref> and [[Keith Martin]].<ref>"Five More MPs endorse Harper", ''Canada NewsWire'', [[20 February]] [[2002]], 14:25 report.</ref> During the campaign, Harper reprised his earlier warnings against an alliance with [[Quebec]] nationalists, and called for his party to become the federalist option in Quebec.<ref>Stephen Harper, "A vision of federalism for all Canadians", ''National Post'', [[19 January]] [[2002]], A18.</ref> He argued that "the French language is not imperilled in Quebec", and opposed "special status" for the province in the [[Canadian Constitution]] accordingly.<ref>Arpon Basu, "Alliance candidate Stephen Harper says French not threatened in Quebec", ''Canadian Press'', [[19 January]] [[2002]], 17:34 report.</ref> He also endorsed greater provincial autonomy on [[Medicare (Canada)|Medicare]], and said that he would not co-operate with the Progressive Conservatives as long as they were led by [[Joe Clark]].<ref>Brian Laghi, "Harper launches campaign", ''Globe and Mail'', [[4 December]] [[2001]], A8.</ref> On social issues, Harper argued for "parental rights" to use [[corporal punishment]] against their children and supported raising the age of sexual consent.<ref>Brian Laghi, "Harper campaigns on social issues", ''Globe and Mail'', [[21 February]] [[2002]], A4.</ref> He described his potential support base as "similar to what [[George W. Bush|George Bush]] tapped".<ref>Ian Hunter, "The cult of policy", ''Globe and Mail'', [[7 March]] [[2002]], A19.</ref>

The tone of the leadership contest turned hostile in February 2002.  Harper described Day's governance of the party as "amateurish",<ref>"No more Mr. Nice Guy in Alliance leadership race", ''Kitchener-Waterloo Record'', [[4 February]] [[2002]], A3.</ref> while his campaign team argued that Day was attempting to win re-election by building a narrow support base among different groups in the religious right.<ref>Robert Fife, "Day accused of courting evangelicals", ''National Post'', [[9 February]] [[2002]], A06.</ref> The Day campaign accused Harper of "attacking ethnic and religious minorities".<ref>Campbell Clark, "Harper attacking minorities, Day leadership camp charges", ''Globe and Mail'', [[12 February]] [[2002]], A12.</ref> In early March, the two candidates had an especially fractious debate on [[CBC Newsworld]].<ref>Brian Laghi, "Harper, Day swap insults in debate", ''Globe and Mail'', [[8 March]] [[2002]], A4.</ref> The leadership vote was held on [[March 20]], [[2002]].  Harper was elected on the first ballot with 55% support, against 37% for Day.  Two other candidates split the remainder.

After winning the party leadership, Harper announced his intention to run for parliament in a [[by-election]] in [[Calgary Southwest]], recently vacated by Preston Manning. [[Ezra Levant]] had already been chosen as the riding's Alliance candidate and initially declared that he would not stand aside for Harper; he subsequently reconsidered.<ref>Dawn Walton, "Rookie Levant ready to run", ''Globe and Mail'', [[28 March]] [[2002]], A8; Sheldon Alberts, "'Troubled' Levant lets Harper run", ''National Post'', [[29 March]] [[2002]], A01.</ref> The Liberals did not field a candidate, following a parliamentary tradition of allowing opposition leaders to enter the House of Commons unopposed. The Progressive Conservative candidate, [[Jim Prentice]], also chose to withdraw.<ref>"Alliance leader won't face Tories in byelection bid", ''Winnipeg Free Press'', [[31 March]] [[2002]], A8.</ref> Harper was elected without difficulty over [[New Democratic Party|New Democrat]] [[Bill Phipps]], a former [[United Church of Canada|United Church]] moderator. Harper told a reporter during the campaign that he "despise[d]" Phipps, and declined to debate him.<ref>Jeffrey Simpson, "He makes Harper think uncharitable thoughts", ''Globe and Mail'', [[7 May]] [[2002]], A19.  Phipps later said that he was "shocked" by Harper's language.  See Louise Elliott, "NDP candidate slams Alliance leader for personal comment, refusal to debate", ''Canadian Press'', [[9 May]] [[2002]], 17:23 report. </ref>  

Harper officially became [[Leader of the Opposition (Canada)|Leader of the Opposition]] in May 2002. Later in the same month, he courted controversy by saying that the [[Atlantic Provinces]] were trapped in "a culture of defeat" which had to be overcome, the result of policies designed by Liberal and Progressive Conservative governments. Many Atlantic politicians condemned the remark as patronizing and insensitive. The [[Legislature of Nova Scotia]] unanimously approved a motion condemning Harper's comments,<ref>Brian Laghi, "Motion by MLAs condemns Harper", ''Globe and Mail'', [[31 May]] [[2002]], A5.  The motion was brought forward by Nova Scotia NDP leader [[Darrell Dexter]].</ref> which were also criticized by [[New Brunswick]] [[Premier of New Brunswick|Premier]] [[Bernard Lord]], [[Canada|federal]] Progressive Conservative leader [[Joe Clark]] and others. Harper refused to apologize, and said that much of Canada was trapped by the same "can't-do" attitude.<ref>Louise Elliott, "Harper calls Canada a nation of defeatists, defends remark about easterners", ''Canadian Press'', [[29 May]] [[2002]], 17:23 report; Brian Laghi, "Premiers tell Harper his attack was wrong", ''Globe and Mail'', [[30 May]] [[2002]], A8.</ref>
 
His first 18 months as opposition leader were largely devoted towards consolidating the fractured elements of the Canadian Alliance and encouraging a union of the Canadian Alliance and the federal Progressive Conservatives. The aim of this union was to present only one right-of-centre national party in the next federal election, thus preventing the vote-splitting of the past. In undertaking the merger talks, PC leader Peter MacKay reversed his previous agreement with leadership opponent [[David Orchard]] not to merge with the Alliance. After reaching an agreement with MacKay in October 2003, the Canadian Alliance and the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada officially merged in December, with the new party being named the "[[Conservative Party of Canada]]".

Harper is reported to have attended the [[2003 Bilderberg Meeting|2003 meeting]] of the [[Bilderberg Group]].<ref>CTV news report, [[9 June]] [[2006]]. See also [[List of Bilderberg attendees]].</ref>

==Conservative Party of Canada leadership==
On [[January 12]], [[2004]], Harper announced his resignation as Leader of the Opposition, in order to run for the leadership of the [[Conservative Party of Canada]]. Harper won the [[Conservative Party of Canada leadership election, 2004|Conservative leadership election]] easily, with a first ballot majority against [[Belinda Stronach]] and [[Tony Clement]] on [[March 20]], [[2004]]. Harper's victory included strong showings in Ontario, Quebec, and Atlantic Canada. 

{{seealso|Stephen Harper Leadership Team}}

===2004 federal election===
Harper led the Conservatives during the [[Canadian federal election, 2004|2004 federal election]], where it was widely believed he had a chance to defeat Liberal Prime Minister [[Paul Martin]]. After an immensely damaging release by [[Auditor General of Canada|Auditor General]] [[Sheila Fraser]] regarding the [[sponsorship scandal|government's lack of oversight of the Sponsorship Program]] of the 1990s, and voter anger in Ontario against Liberal Premier [[Dalton McGuinty]] for breaking a promise not to raise taxes, polls showed the Conservatives in a dead heat with the Liberals. 

Late in the campaign, the Conservatives began to attract negative attention for controversial remarks made by MPs and candidates regarding [[homosexuality]], [[Bilingualism in Canada|official bilingualism]] and [[abortion]]. Additionally, the Liberal Party began airing controversial TV [[attack ad]]s suggesting that the Conservatives would make Canada more like the United States.  Harper was also criticized for his position supporting the American-led [[2003 invasion of Iraq]].  The term "hidden agenda", used commonly in the 2000 election to refer to Stockwell Day, began surfacing with increasing regularity with regard to Harper's history of supporting privatized health care. Further damaging the Conservative campaign was a press release from Conservative headquarters that suggested that Paul Martin supported [[child pornography]].  The momentum began to swing against his party, although some polls suggested it was neck and neck right up until election day. 

The Conservative Party was successful in gaining seats in Ontario, where the Reform Party and Canadian Alliance had never been able to make significant gains, but Martin was re-elected with a minority government and 135 seats. The Conservatives finished in second-place with 99 seats. While the Conservatives had improved on the 72 seats they held entering the election, the party took 29.6% of the popular vote, down from the 37.7% combined total of the Canadian Alliance and Progressive Conservatives in 2000.  Harper, after some personal deliberation, decided to stay on as the party leader.  Many credited him with bringing the Progressive Conservative Party and Canadian Alliance together in a short time to fight a close election.

===Harper as Conservative leader and Leader of the Opposition===
The Conservative Party's first policy convention was held from [[March 17]]-19, 2005, in [[Montreal]].  A more moderate party stance was demonstrated, in accordance with what many viewed as Harper's goal.  Any opposition to abortion or bilingualism was dropped from the Conservative platform, though the party was still opposed to same-sex marriage.  Harper received an 84% endorsement from delegates in the leadership review.  

The party soon began a controversial fight against [[same-sex marriage]].  Harper was criticized by a group of law professors for arguing that the government could not override the provincial court rulings without using the "[[Section Thirty-three of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|notwithstanding clause]]", a provision of [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Canada's Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]. Harper and constitutional lawyer/Conservative Justice Critic [[Vic Toews]] suggest that this clause does not have to be used to enshrine the traditional definition of marriage. 

Following the April 2005 release of [[Jean Brault]]'s damaging testimony at the [[Gomery Inquiry]], implicating the Liberals in the scandal, opinion polls placed the Conservatives ahead of Liberals.  The Conservatives had earlier abstained from the vote on the [[Canadian federal budget, 2005|2005 budget]] to avoid forcing an election.  With the collapse in Liberal support and a controversial NDP amendment to the budget, the party exerted significant pressure on Harper to bring down the government. In May, Harper announced that the government had lost the "moral authority to govern", with the support of the ''[[Bloc Qu<U+00E9>b<U+00E9>cois]]''.  The effort failed following the decision of Conservative MP [[Belinda Stronach]] to [[crossing the floor|cross the floor]] to the Liberal Party. The vote on the NDP amendment to the budget tied, and with the [[Speaker of the Canadian House of Commons|Speaker of the House]] voting to continue debate, the Liberals stayed in power.

Harper was also criticized for supporting his caucus colleague MP [[Gurmant Grewal]].  Grewal had produced tapes of conversations with [[Tim Murphy]], Paul Martin's chief of staff, in which Grewal claimed he had been offered a cabinet position in exchange for his defection. Some experts analyzed the tapes and concluded that a digital copy of the tapes had been edited. 

On [[November 24]], [[2005]], Harper introduced a [[motion of no confidence]] on the Liberal government, telling the House of Commons "that this government has lost the confidence of the House of Commons and needs to be removed."  As the Liberals had lost [[New Democratic Party]] support in the house by refusing to accept an NDP plan to prevent health care privatization, the no confidence motion was passed by a vote of 171-133.  As a result, Parliament was dissolved and a general election was scheduled for [[January 23]], 2006.

==2006 federal election==
[[Image:Harper,-Stephen-Jan-23-06.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Stephen Harper gives a victory speech to [[Political party|party]]  faithful in [[Calgary]] after his [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservatives]] won the [[Canadian federal election, 2006|2006 federal election]].]]

{{main|Canadian federal election, 2006}}
Harper started off the first month of the campaign with a policy-per-day strategy, which included a GST reduction and a child-care allowance.  The Liberals opted to hold any major announcements until after the Christmas holidays; as a result, Harper dominated media coverage for the first weeks of the campaign and was able to define his platform and insulate it from expected Liberal attacks.  Though his party showed only modest movement in the polls, Harper's personal numbers, which had always trailed his party's significantly, began to rise. 

On [[December 27]], [[2005]], the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] announced it was investigating allegations that Liberal [[Minister of Finance (Canada)|Finance Minister]] [[Ralph Goodale]]'s office had engaged in [[insider trading]] before making an important announcement on the taxation of [[income trust]]s.  The income trust scandal dominated news coverage for the following week and prevented the Liberals from making their key policy announcements, allowing Harper to refocus his previous attacks about corruption within the Liberal party. The Conservatives soon found themselves leading in the polls. By early January, they made a major breakthrough in Quebec, pushing the Liberals to second place.

In response to the growing Conservative lead, the Liberals launched [[2006 Harper attack ads|negative ads targeting Harper]], similar to their attacks in the 2004 election. However, their tactics had little effect this time since the Conservatives had much more momentum and had opened up a ten point advantage. Harper's personal numbers had risen considerably and polls found he was now considered not only more trustworthy, but he would also make a better Prime Minister than Martin.<ref>{{cite news | author=CTV.ca News Staff| title = Harper seen as most trusted leader, poll finds | url = http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20060111/ELXN_poll_060111/20060111?s_name=election2006&no_ads= | work = CTV.ca | date = 2005-01-11 | accessdate = 2006-09-21}}</ref>

As their lead solidified, [[Newspaper endorsements in the Canadian federal election, 2006|media coverage]] of the Conservatives was much more positive, while Liberals found themselves increasingly criticized for running a poor campaign and making numerous gaffes.<ref>{{cite news | first = Les | last = Whittington | title = 'This is like a live grenade' for Liberal party | url = http://www.thestar.com/NASApp/cs/ContentServer?pagename=thestar/Render&c=Article&cid=1135896622064&call_pageid=968332188774 | format = Free | work = Toronto Star | publisher = Toronto Star Newspapers | date = 2005-12-30 | accessdate = 2006-08-31}}</ref>

On [[January 23]], the Conservatives won 124 seats against 103 for the Liberals.  Martin conceded defeat at midnight on [[January 24]], and at 9:45 a.m. that morning, announced his intention to resign as Prime Minister. At 6:45 p.m., [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] [[Micha<U+00EB>lle Jean]] asked Harper to form a government.  He was sworn in as Canada's 22nd Prime Minister on [[February 6]], [[2006]].  Harper is the first person not representing a Quebec [[Riding#Canada|riding]] to be appointed Prime Minister since [[Joe Clark]] in 1979.

==Prime Minister==
{{main|Stephen Harper as Prime Minister of Canada}}
===Cabinet===
Although the majority of Conservative seats were from the Western provinces, the majority of names which Harper put forward to the [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] for appointment as Cabinet Ministers were from Ontario and Quebec, in the interests of regional balance. The new Conservative Cabinet was substantially smaller than the prior Martin administration because it did away with junior ministers (known as Ministers of State, and previously Secretaries of State). Several pundits in the media have described Harper's Cabinet as moderate, and a tempering of the Conservative Party's roots in the Canadian Alliance and Reform.

Two of Harper's selections generated some controversy. He chose outgoing Liberal [[Minister of Industry (Canada)|Minister of Industry]] [[David Emerson]] as [[Minister of International Trade (Canada)|Minister of International Trade]] and Minister for the Pacific Gateway and the [[2010 Winter Olympics]], and [[Michael Fortier]], a senior Conservative Party operative and campaign strategist, as [[Minister of Public Works and Government Services (Canada)|Minister of Public Works]], and as an appointee to the [[Canadian Senate|Senate]]. Emerson had been re-elected to parliament as a Liberal only weeks earlier, while Fortier did not contest the previous election at all. Harper argued that the appointments were necessary to provide two of Canada's largest cities ([[Vancouver]] and [[Montreal]]) with Cabinet representation, as the Conservatives did not win seats in these cities.  Critics countered that no such concessions were made for Canada's largest city, [[Toronto]], where the conservatives also failed to win a seat, but proponents of the Prime Minister contest that MP and Finance Minister [[Jim Flaherty]], representing the nearby city of [[Whitby, Ontario|Whitby]], will represent Torontonians in Cabinet. 

On [[March 3]], [[2006]], Ethics Commissioner [[Bernard Shapiro]] announced that he was launching a preliminary inquiry into conflict-of-interest allegations against Emerson and Harper. Shapiro said that he would look into what influence may have been wielded in the decision by Emerson to cross the floor.<ref>{{cite news | first=CTV.ca News Staff | last= | url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20060301/emerson_election_060303/20060303?hub=TopStories | title=Harper to be investigated by ethics commissioner | publisher=CTV | pages= | page=|date=[[3 March]] [[2006]] | accessdate=2006-04-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | first=CBC News | last= | url=http://www.cbc.ca/story/canada/national/2006/03/03/emerson_060303.html | title=

Mr Shapiro concluded that a minister crossing the floor to take a Cabinet position would only have been inappropriate if said Cabinet position was offered to prevent the government from falling on a confidence vote.  Emerson's appointment did not fall under those conditions and Shapiro cleared both Harper and Emerson of any wrongdoing on [[March 20]] [[2006]].  Shapiro declined to launch any investigation into Belinda Stronach's floor-crossing.

===Deputy Prime Minister and succession===
Unlike his recent predecessors, Harper did not name one of his colleagues to the largely honorific post of [[Deputy Prime Minister of Canada|Deputy Prime Minister]]. Various observers had expected him to name MacKay, the former leader of the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative Party]] and his deputy party leader, or [[Lawrence Cannon]], as a [[Quebec lieutenant]], to the post. Harper did, however, name an order of succession to act on his behalf in certain circumstances, starting with Cannon, then [[Jim Prentice]], then the balance of his cabinet in [[Canadian order of precedence|order of precedence]].

===Policy===
The Harper government has identified five policy priorities, in the areas of federal accountability, tax reform, crime, child care and health care.

There has been some controversy over the government's plan for child care. The Conservatives have promised to eliminate a federal child care program introduced by the previous Martin government, which provided funding to provincial governments to increase the number of regulated child care spaces and to provide subsidies to low- and middle-income parents. The Conservatives are replacing that program with a $1200 per year stipend for each child under age six, paid directly to parents whether or not they incur child care expenses. Opponents of the Conservative plan argue that the stipend is inadequate and will not address the need for child care spaces, particularly in urban centres. Supporters argue that the Liberal program it replaced was inflexible and discriminated against stay-at-home parents. Harper has stated that his government will work with provincial and local governments, not-for-profit organizations, and employers to create additional spaces, and has set aside $250 million per year to fund these initiatives.

The Conservative Party campaigned on a platform of reducing Canada's [[Goods and Services Tax (Canada)|Goods and Services Tax]] from 7% to 6%, and eventually to 5%. During the 2006 election campaign, the Martin government proposed income tax cuts for lower-middle income earners. The Liberals have claimed that the GST cut would effectively result in a tax increase for those in the lower-middle income bracket. The Conservatives argued that the GST cuts would benefit all Canadians, including low-income earners and those outside the workforce who do not pay income tax.

The Harper government has promised to introduce mandatory minimal sentences for serious and violent offenders, and to introduce a "Patient Wait Times Guarantee" in conjunction with the provinces. Harper has recently been criticised by prominent media figures, such as Paul Wells, for downplaying this fifth and final priority.

In addition to its "Five Priorities", the government has also devoted significant attention to military issues.

===The Federal Accountability Act===
{{main|Federal Accountability Act}}
On [[April 11]], 2006, [[President of the Treasury Board (Canada)|President of the Treasury Board]] [[John Baird (Canadian politician)|John Baird]], on behalf of the Harper government, tabled the Federal Accountability Act and Action Plan. The plan will reduce the opportunity to exert influence with money by banning corporate, union, and large personal political donations; five-year lobbying ban on former ministers, their aides, and senior public servants; providing protection for whistleblowers; and enhancing the power for the Auditor General to follow the money spent by the government.

While the government hopes to have this act passed before the [[Canadian House of Commons|House of Commons]] breaks for the summer, questions have arisen surrounding elements of the Federal Acountability Act and how it might affect the 2006 Liberal leadership convention.  A $1,000 donation limit has been proposed as part of the Federal Accountability Act with political party convention donations being tied to this amount.  The Liberal Party of Canada's leadership convention scheduled for December 2006 contains a $995 convention fee, which under the proposed Accountability Act could prevent convention delegates from donating anything beyond their convention fee or prevent the delegate's presence at the convention should their convention fee in conjunction with any donations prior to the convention put them above the donation limit.  Some of the Senate majority-holding Liberal Senators have threatened to stall the Federal Accountability Act in the upper chamber until after December because of the effect the proposed donation limits may have on political party conventions.

===Relations with the United States===

{{Main|Foreign Policy of the Harper government}}

Shortly after being congratulated by [[George W. Bush]] for his victory, Harper rebuked U.S. [[Ambassador]] to Canada [[David Wilkins]] for criticizing the Conservatives' plans to assert Canada's sovereignty over the [[Arctic]] waters with armed forces. 

On [[February 16]] [[2006]], Harper named former Progressive Conservative Party Cabinet Minister [[Michael Wilson (politician)|Michael Wilson]] as Governor General [[Micha<U+00EB>lle Jean]]'s appointee to the post of Canada's [[Ambassador]] to the United States, replacing Liberal appointee [[Frank McKenna]].<ref name="ctv wilson">{{cite news | first=CTV.ca News Staff | last= | url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20060216/wilson_ambassador_confirm_060216?s_name=&no_ads= | title=New envoy Wilson sets softwood as top priority | publisher=CTV | pages= | page=|date=[[17 February]] [[2006]] | accessdate=2006-04-04}}</ref>

Harper's first meeting with the U.S. President occurred at the end of March, 2006; and while little was achieved in the way of solid agreements, the trip was described in the media as signalling a trend of closer relations between the two nations.

On [[April 27]], [[2006]], Harper announced in Parliament that the government had reached a seven-year agreement with the United States in the nations' long-standing feud over softwood lumber. The three major softwood-producing provinces &mdash; British Columbia, Ontario, and Quebec &mdash; accepted the compromise.<ref>{{cite news | author = CTV.ca News Staff | title = PM strikes deal with U.S. to end lumber dispute | url = http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20060426/softwood_folo_060427/20060427?hub=TopStories | format = Free | work = CTV News | date = 2006-04-28|accessdate = 2006-08-31}}</ref> Leader of the Opposition [[Bill Graham]] and NDP leader [[Jack Layton]] did not, criticising the deal for not requiring the U.S. to pay back all $5 billion it had collected in tariffs on Canadian softwood lumber.<ref>{{cite news | author = CBC News Staff | title = Canada, U.S. agree to softwood lumber deal | url = http://www.cbc.ca/story/world/national/2006/04/27/softwood060427.html | format = Free | work = CBC News | date = 2006-04-27 | accessdate = 2006-08-31}}</ref>

On [[September 12]], 2006, the Canadian and U.S governments officially signed the deal in [[Ottawa]] ending the dispute.<ref>{{cite news | author = CTV News | title = Emerson and U.S. counterpart ink softwood deal | publisher = CTV | url = http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20060911/softwood_deal_060912/20060912?hub=TopStories | date = September 12, 2006 }}</ref>  Still, it was subject for a [[confidence vote]] in the [[Canadian House of Commons|House of Commons]] during the fall session.

===First overseas trip===
On [[March 11]] and [[March 12]], 2006, Harper made a surprise trip to [[Afghanistan]], where Canadian Forces personnel have been deployed since late 2001, to visit troops in theatre as a show of support for their efforts, and a demonstration of the government's commitment to reconstruction and stability in the region. Harper's choice of a first foreign visit was closely guarded from the press until his arrival in Afghanistan (citing security concerns), and is seen as marking a significant change in relationship between the government and the military. While other foreign leaders have visited Afghanistan, Harper's trip was touted as unprecedented in its length and scope.<ref>[http://news.yahoo.com/s/cpress/20060314/ca_pr_on_wo/harper_afghanistan yahoo.com]</ref> While the PM, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Defence Minister have visited the region, Governor General Micha<U+00EB>lle Jean has twice been advised not to go.

===Relations with the press===
Stephen Harper has insisted on his right to choose who asks questions at press conferences [http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2006/05/24/harper05242006.html], which has created some conflict with national media [http://www.canada.com/globaltv/national/story.html?id=89eafbaf-ddbe-45b6-aff9-f33ec9cb20a3]. It has been reported that the Prime Minister's Office also "often informs the media about Harper's trips at such short notice that it's impossible for Ottawa journalists to attend the events". [http://www.thestar.com/NASApp/cs/ContentServer?pagename=thestar/Layout/Article_Type1&c=Article&cid=1161553809722&call_pageid=968332188492]
Since March at least, the gallery and media managers have been lodging protests over how the PMO has been handling everything from press conferences to notice of Harper's public events.

===2006 Budget===
The first federal budget of the newly elected Conservative government was brought forth on [[May 2]] [[2006]] by Finance Minister [[Jim Flaherty]].  It was met with dissent by the Liberal and New Democratic parties and mostly positive reception from the Bloc.  The Liberals and NDP voiced disapproval over the Conservatives following through on their election promise to replace the Liberals child care policy with their own, and for replacing Canada's $4 billion environmental policy with a $2 Billion "made in Canada" plan of their design.  The budget was met with widespread support amongst the business community and polling indicated that a clear majority of Canadians approved of the budget.

While it initially appeared that the only way the Conservatives' budget would pass would be with the support of the [[Bloc Quebecois]], the budget passed third reading without dissent on [[June 6]] [[2006]] when the members of the Opposition accidentally failed to stand after the Deputy Speaker of the House called for debate.  Because there were no speakers for the Opposition, the budget was declared passed with unanimous support and no recorded vote and thus forwarded to the Senate for approval.  This marked the first time in Canadian Parliamentary history where a government's budget passed unanimously on the third and final reading.

On September 25, 2006, the Conservative government annonced that within the fiscal year, there was a 13.2 billion-dollar surplus that will be used to pay down the country's debt.<ref>http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20060925/surplus_payment_060925/20060925?hub=TopStories</ref>

===Parliamentary reform===
Stephen Harper has indicated a desire to turn the [[Canadian Senate]] into an elected rather than an appointed body, an objective previously proposed by the former Reform Party of Canada. His desire includes fixed election dates with earlier elections possible in the case of minority governments. On [[September 7]], [[2006]], Harper became the first Canadian Prime Minister to appear before a Senate committee and was present to make his government's case for Senate reform.

===Apology to Chinese-Canadians===
On [[June 23]], [[2006]], Stephen Harper offered full apology to Chinese Canadians for the country's treatment of Chinese immigrants during the years 1885 to 1923 on the imposing [[Head tax (Canada)|Head Tax]] policy to them, and subsequent discrimination policies, including subsequent exclusion of Chinese immigrants from 1923 until 1947. It is estimated about 82,000 Chinese paid the fee, first set at $50 and later raised to $500, about two years' wages at the time. Harper said that  Chinese-Canadians who paid the tax or their surviving spouses will receive a symbolic $20,000 ex-gratia payment.<ref name=Chinese_head_tax_apology>{{cite news | first = Ian | last = Mulgrew | title = Harper makes long-anticipated apology for Chinese head tax | url = http://www.canada.com/cityguides/winnipeg/info/story.html?id=62b7cbf1-ead3-448c-b1c0-ae283cb7a78d&k=35045  | format = Free | work = Vancouver Sun | publisher = CanWest MediaWorks Publications | pages = 1-2 | date = 2006-06-23 | accessdate = 2006-06-23 }}</ref>

===Israel-Lebanon conflict===
[[Image:Canadian Prime Minister, G8 Summit.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Harper at the [[32nd G8 summit|32<sup>nd</sup> G8 summit]], held July 15-17, 2006, which focused much of its attention on the Israel-Lebanon conflict.]]
{{Main|International reactions to the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict}}
At the outset of the [[2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict]], Harper defended publicly [[Israel]]'s "right to defend itself," and described the invasion of Lebanon as a "measured" response, feeling that [[Hezbollah]] and [[Hamas]]'s release of Israeli prisoners would be the key to ending the conflict.<ref name="The Globe and Mail">{{cite news|title=Harper sides firmly with Israel|date=[[2006-07-13]]|publisher=[[Globe and Mail]]|url= http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20060713.wHarper0713/BNStory/Front}}</ref>
Many Arab-Canadians criticized Harper's description of the response as "measured".  On July 17, 2006, Harper noted that the situation had deteriorated since his initial comments, but that it was difficult for Israel to fight "non-governmental forces" embedded in the civilian population. Harper reiterated his earlier support for Israel and called on both sides to show restraint and minimize civilian casualties.

The Canadian government made arrangements to evacuate about 30,000 Canadians, mainly of Lebanese descent, from [[Lebanon]] after hostilities broke out. The response was criticized as slow and inefficient.<ref name="The Globe and Mail 3">{{cite news|title=Canadian evacuation going much smoother|date=[[2006-07-22]]|publisher=[[Globe and Mail]]|url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20060722.wcaneva20722/BNStory/Front}}</ref>  On July 17, a group of protesters, primarily expatriate Lebanese, protested Israeli aggression in front of the Israeli consulate in [[Montreal]]; further protests took place July 22 in localities across Canada.<ref name="Montreal Gazette">{{cite news|title=Opponents of Lebanese attack hold vigil outside Israeli consulate in Montreal|date=[[2006-07-22]]|publisher=[[Montreal Gazette]]|url=http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/story.html?id=bb1f191f-eadd-4b26-b4c7-e49376aa4fe9&k=16542}}</ref>   

Despite criticisms, [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Canada)|Foreign Affairs Minister]] [[Peter MacKay]] joined Harper in reiterating support for Israel's position and urging restraint while calling for a ceasefire.  Speaking of the situation in both Lebanon and [[Gaza]] on July 18, Harper told reporters, "We all want to encourage not just a ceasefire, but a resolution. And a resolution will only be achieved when everyone gets to the table and everyone admits...recognition of each other," referring to the refusal of Hezbollah and Hamas to recognize Israel's right to exist.  Harper laid the blame for the civilian deaths on both sides at the feet of Hezbollah. "Hezbollah's objective is violence," Harper asserted, "Hezbollah believes that through violence it can create, it can bring about the destruction of Israel. Violence will not bring about the destruction of Israel... and inevitably the result of the violence will be the deaths primarily of innocent people.".<ref name="National Post">{{cite news|title=

===The War in Afghanistan===
{{see|Stephen Harper#First overseas trip}}
	 
In early 2006, the Conservative government proposed a motion to extend the Canadian military mission in  Afghanistan by at least two years. In May 2006 the House of Commons passed a motion, after a short six-hour debate, to extend the mission until 2009 by a slim 149-145 majority.<ref>{{cite news | author = CTV.ca News Staff | title = MPs narrowly vote to extend Afghanistan mission | url = http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20060517/nato_afghan_060517/20060517/ | format = Free | work = CTV.ca | publisher = CTV Inc. | date = 2006-05-17 | accessdate = 2006-08-31}}</ref> 	 
The Harper government reinstituted a policy of lowering the national flag at military installations such as Department of National Defence headquarters only, drawing criticism that the government was showing a lack of respect for the soldiers.<ref>{{cite news | title = Four Canadian soldiers killed in Afghanistan | url = http://www.cbc.ca/story/world/national/2006/04/22/afghanistan-deaths060422.html | format = Free | work = CBC News | date = 2006-04-22 | accessdate = 2006-08-31 }}</ref>

===Environment===

{{Main|Domestic Policy of the Harper government}}

Harper and the Conservative government had criticized the [[Kyoto Accord]] on measures for controlling the global warming and [[greenhouse gas]] emissions. Harper considered that the objectives implemented by Canada to comply with the Accord were not realistic. He plans to create a "Made in Canada" solution that will concentrate its efforts on reducing [[smog]] pollution which would include regulations on gases coming from car exhaust pipes.<ref> {{cite news | author = LCN | title = Rona Ambrose s'attaquera aux gaz d'<U+00E9>chappement | url = http://lcn.canoe.com/infos/national/archives/2006/10/20061002-213247.html | publisher = TVA/LCN | date = October 2, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | author = CBC News | title = Indepth Kyoto | publisher = CBC | url = http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/kyoto/keyresources.html | date = May 3, 2006 }}</ref><ref> {{ cite news | author = CBC News | title = Reality Check : Goodbye Kyoto? | publisher = CBC | url = http://www.cbc.ca/canadavotes/realitycheck/goodbye_kyoto.html | date = January 18, 2006 }}</ref> In a CTV report in October, however, the Conservatives had mentioned that it would be an approach rather than a plan.<ref> {{cite news | author = CTV News| title = Tories downgrade 'Made-in-Canada' Green plan |  publisher = CTV | url = http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20061005/environment_approach_061005?s_name=&no_ads=  | date = October 5, 2006 }}</ref>

On October 10, 2006 in [[Vancouver]], Harper had annonced some of the measures to fight smog and also greenhouse emissions such as tax credits to environmental-friendly measures, a repackaged [[air quality]] health index and a program to retrofit diesel school buses. He will also introduced to [[Parliament]] a [[Clean Air Act]] with other measures to be annonced in the upcoming days and would focus on long-term objectives. These measures would "move industry from voluntary compliance to strict enforcement; replace the current ad hoc, patchwork system with clear, consistent, and comprehensive national standards; and institute a holistic approach that doesn't treat the related issues of pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions in isolation." Prior to the announcement, activists groups across Canada had initially listed a series of recommendations to the Prime Minister including regulations on big industries and a recommitment to the [[Kyoto Protocol]]. Also, during the press conference, the term "Made In Canada Plan" reappeared.<ref> {{cite news | author = CTV News | title = Harper rolls out first part of environment plan | publisher = CTV | url = http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20061009/tories_green_plan_061009/20061010?hub=Canada | date = October 10, 2006}}</ref>

Details of the [[Clean Air Act]] were revealed on October 19, 2006. Its main plan is to reduce greenhouse emissions to about 45 to 65% of the 2003 levels but for the year [[2050]] with decrease starting in 2020. There would also be regulations for vehicule fuel consumption as well as for industries but not before 2011 and 2010 respectively while oil companies will slightly reduce emissions for each barrel but can still produce more oil barrels until 2020.<ref> {{cite news | author = CTV News | title = Conservative government tables Clean Air Act | publisher = CTV | url = http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20061018/environment_act_061019/20061019?hub=TopStories | date = October 19, 2006 }} </ref>

To date, the government during Harper's prime ministership has avoided dealing with many of the more controversial social policy positions of the Conservative party, although they have followed through with increasing the legal [[age of consent]] from 14 to 16 years,<ref>{{cite news | author = CTV News | title = Mixed reviews to Tories' sexual consent bill | publisher = CTV | url = http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20060622/age_consent_060622/20060623/ | date = June 23, 2006}}</ref>
and have promised a free vote to revisit the issue of [[same-sex marriage]].  However, the vote  will likely not pass.<ref>{{cite news | author = CBC News | title = Pope assails Canada's laws allowing same-sex marriage and abortion | publisher = CBC | url = http://www.cbc.ca/cp/Home+Family/060908/U090814U.html | date = September 8, 2006 }}</ref>

There were also plans to pass a law that would protect "freedom of religious expression", a law that according to many is perceived as a protection to opponents of same-sex marriage. The government cut funding to various social programs and festivals, some of which related to the gay community and same-sex marriage,<ref>{{cite news | author = Rheaume, Normand | title = Festival et mariage gais dans la mire des conservateurs | url = http://lcn.canoe.com/lcn/infos/national/collineparlementaire/archives/2006/10/20061004-131844.html | publisher = TVA/LCN | date = October 4, 2006}}</ref><ref> {{cite news | author = CTV News | title = Tories blasted on same-sex marriage backup plan | publisher = CTV | url = http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20061004/same_sex_061004/20061004?hub=TopStories | date = October 4, 2006 }}</ref>
and reduced spending for womens advocacy work on the status of women in the country.<ref> {{cite news | author = CTV News | title = Tories to cut funding for womens' advocacy work | url = http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20061004/tories_women_061004/20061004?hub=Politics | publisher = CTV | date = October 4, 2006}}</ref>

===Supreme Court===

Aside from his legislative agenda, Harper put forward [[Marshall Rothstein]] to Governor General Micha<U+00EB>lle Jean for appointment as the new [[Puisne Justice]] to the [[Supreme Court of Canada]], on [[February 23]], [[2006]]. Rothstein had been 'short listed' with two other potential judges by a committee convened by the previous Liberal government.  In keeping with election promises of a new appointment process, Harper announced Rothstein had to appear before an '[[ad hoc]]' non-partisan committee of 12 [[Members of Parliament]].  However, the committee did not have the power to veto the [[appointment]], which was what some members of his own party had called for.<ref>  [http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20060220.w2harper02201/BNStory/National/home Globe and Mail [[20 February]] [[2006]].]</ref>

==Harper's religious faith==
An opinion column in [[The Walrus]] states that [[evangelical Christians]] see Harper as "''an image-savvy evangelical who has been careful to keep his signals to them under the media radar, but they have no doubt his convictions run deep''" <ref name=McDonaldWalrus>Marci McDonald, "Stephen Harper and the Theo-cons", ''[[The Walrus]]'', [[October]] [[2006]].</ref>.  However Harper, like previous Prime Ministers, has not sought to impose his faith upon others.  "''It is perfectly legitimate for citizens and legislators to take into account their own deeply held faith convictions in developing public policy, provided that people remain open to the faith and philosophical perspectives of others.''" <ref> [http://christianity.ca/news/national/2006/01.001.html Faith and Politics: Party Leaders Respond"], ''Faith Today'', [[January 11]], [[2006]]</ref>

==Honours==
Harper has the postnominal "PC" for life by virtue of being made a member of the [[Queen's Privy Council for Canada]] on [[May 4]], [[2004]].<ref>[http://www.pco-bcp.gc.ca/default.asp?Language=E&Page=InformationResources&Sub=PrivyCouncilMembers Information Resources page from Canada government website]</ref> His prenominal was changed from "The Honourable" to "The Right Honourable" for [[life]] when he became Prime Minister on [[February 6]], [[2006]].

Harper also received the [[Woodrow Wilson Award]] on October 6, 2006 for his public service in Calgary. It was held at the Telus Convention Centre in Calgary, the same place where he made his victory speech.
