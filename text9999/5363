He was appointed Economics Editor in 1996. During his time in [[RT<U+00C9> News and Current Affairs]] he was named Irish Journalist of the Year for uncovering a major [[Tax avoidance and tax evasion|tax evasion]] and overcharging scandal at [[National Irish Bank]]. He has also presented many documentary programmes for RT<U+00C9>.

Lee became a [[Teachta D<U+00E1>la]] (TD) for the [[Dublin South (D<U+00E1>il <U+00C9>ireann constituency)|Dublin South]] constituency in June 2009, winning a [[Dublin South by-election, 2009|by-election]] with a 53.4% majority and was referred to as a "celebrity TD". On 8 February 2010 Lee announced his resignation both from Fine Gael and from [[D<U+00E1>il <U+00C9>ireann]], having spent nine months in politics. His reasoning was that he had "virtually no influence or input". He is set to return to RT<U+00C9> later in 2010.

===Resignation from politics===
On 8 February 2010, he announced his resignation from Fine Gael and from D<U+00E1>il <U+00C9>ireann, due to having "virtually no influence or input" into shaping Fine Gael's economic policies at a time of economic upheaval.<ref name="RT<U+00C9> Fine Gael TD George Lee resigns">

Kenny then offered Lee the frontbench position as spokesman on economic planning. Speaking to reporters outside [[Leinster House]] soon after his announcement, Lee said it would have been dishonest of him to accept the position: "I had absolutely no input for nine months. I think I had to be honest with myself and honest with the electorate about that and not pretend." Asked if his resignation was a vote of no confidence in Kenny, Lee said there were "certainly lots of large mutterings at the moment in relation to the leader's position". He said he had "minimal involvement" with Fine Gael finance spokesman [[Richard Bruton]]. "I had a maximum of two or three conversations with Richard Bruton in a total nine months period. I don<U+2019>t know how my relationship is with [him]" Lee said.<ref name=IT_20090209>

Kenny noted Lee had been appointed chair of the party's committee on economic policy and also its forum. "I had anticipated a very important role for [George Lee] in the coming period with Fine Gael." Kenny's spokesman later dismissed the proposition that the resignation had implications for his leadership. He cited the public endorsement of Kenny by 20 D<U+00E1>il deputies over the course of the weekend.<ref name=IT_20090209/> Former Fine Gael leader [[Michael Noonan]] said he was surprised at the decision: "I thought that George Lee was fitting in well", adding that he believed he would have been a cabinet member in a Fine Gael led government.

George Lee was criticised after his resignation by Senator [[Eoghan Harris]], who was speaking on the ''Lunchtime'' programme of [[Newstalk]] Radio. Harris suggested financial considerations and long working hours of politicians were the reasons why Lee resigned.<ref>{{cite video
