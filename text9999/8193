'''Walter Scott Kennedy''' (c. 1873 &ndash; April 28, 1954) was an [[American football]] player and coach and newspaper publisher.  He was an All-American [[quarterback]] for the [[University of Chicago]] and captain of the 1898 and 1899 [[Chicago Maroons football]] teams.  He later moved to [[Albion, Michigan]] where he was the publisher of the ''Albion Evening Recorder'' from 1904 to 1939.  He also coached the [[Albion College]] football team from 1904 to 1920.

==Biography==
===Early years===
Kennedy was born in [[Woodburn, Iowa]] in approximately 1873.  He played high school football at [[Villisca, Iowa]].<ref name=Captain/>  After graduating from high school, Kennedy attended [[Tarkio College]] in [[Tarkio, Missouri]], where he again payed football.<ref name=HW/>

===University of Chicago===
Kennedy enrolled at the [[University of Chicago]] where he played football for head coach [[Amos Alonzo Stagg]] from 1896 to 1899.  He also competed for Chicago in baseball and track.<ref name=Thrill/>  Kennedy was five feet, nine inches tall and weighed 196 pounds.<ref name=Captain/>  He began his football career as a [[Tackle (American football)|tackle]], but he was moved to the [[Halfback (American football)|halfback]] position in 1897, playing in the same backfield as [[College Football Hall of Fame]] inductee, [[Clarence Herschberger]].<ref name=Captain/>  At the end of the 1897 season, his teammates elected him as the captain of the 1898 [[Chicago Maroons football]] team.<ref name=Captain>{{cite news|title=Kennedy Is Chosen Captain: Big Half Back of the University of Chicago Will Lead the Maroon Warriors|newspaper=Chicago Daily Tribune|date=1897-12-01}}</ref>  At the time of his election as team captain, the ''[[Chicago Tribune|Chicago Daily Tribune]]'' wrote: "In guarding the men who carry the ball and in breaking up the interference of the opposing team he is unsurpassed in the West, and is a hard man to stop when he himself advances the ball."<ref name=Captain/>  

For the 1898 and 1899 seasons, Kennedy was moved to the [[quarterback]] position.  In November 1898, questions were raised as to Kennedy's eligibility to play college football.  An individual formerly associated with Chicago football, who was then coaching in Iowa, wrote a letter to the University of Chicago reporting that Kennedy's mother had informed him that her son was receiving $500 a year to play football at Chicago.<ref name=Turn>{{cite news|title=NOW IT IS KENNEDY'S TURN: Wisconsin Preparing to Protest the Chicago Captain--He Is Alleged to Be Under Pay|newspaper=Chicago Daily Tribune|date=1898-11-07}}</ref>  Several additional letters were received, raising questions about Kennedy's past, including his baseball record.<ref name=Turn/>  The University of Chicago concluded that Kennedy was eiligible, and he was selected by [[Walter Camp]] as a second-team All-American quarterback in 1898.<ref>{{cite news|title=Camp's 1898 All-America Teams|publisher=Evening Independent|date=1930-11-21}}</ref>  

In February 1899, [[Caspar Whitney]] renewed the controversy over Kennedy's eligibility in an article published in ''[[Harper's Weekly]]''.  <ref name=HW>{{cite news|title=AGAIN CRITICISES CHICAGO: Caspar Whitney Makes Western College Rules Public--Says Kennedy Is Not Protected by Them|newspaper=Chicago Daily Tribune|date=1899-02-18}}</ref>  Whitney had secured a copy of the [[Big Ten Conference|Western Conference]] rules and argued that Kennedy, having played college football at Tarkio College for at least one season, was not eligible to play a fourth year of varsity football for Chicago.<ref name=HW/>

Despite the questions over his eligibility, Kennedy (at age 26) was permitted to return in 1899 as Chicago's starting quarterback.  He was also chosen to be Chicago's captain for a second time in 1899.  Several schools, including Michigan, Illinois and Wisconsin boycotted Chicago in 1899, protesting Chicago's use of players with dubious eligibility.<ref name=Thrill/>  In 1929, a columnist in the ''Chicago Daily Tribune'' wrote that the undefeated 1899 team was considered one of the two greatest Chicago football teams of all time.  The 1899 Chicago Maroons defeated Notre Dame (23&ndash;0), Cornell (17&ndash;6), Purdue (44&ndash;0), Northwestern (76&ndash;0), Minnesota (29&ndash;0), and Brown (17&ndash;6), and played to ties against Iowa (5&ndash;5) and Penn (5&ndash;5).<ref name=Maroon>{{cite news|title=1899 Maroons|newspaper=Chicago Daily Tribune|date=1929-11-06}}</ref>

Because of the boycott of Chicago, the 1899 season ended with uncertainty as to whether Chicago or Wisconsin had fielded the best team in the West.  Wisconsin agreed to a post-season championship game against Chicago.  The game, played on December 9, 1899, was Kennedy's last game for Chicago.  Chicago won the game 17&ndash;0, and Kennedy later described the game as his "greatest thrill in football."<ref name=Thrill>{{cite news|author=Walter S.Kennedy (as told to Harvey Woodruff)|My Greatest Thrill in Football|newspaper=Chicago Daily Tribune|date=1932-10-29}}</ref>  The game matched the punting skills of Wisconsin's [[Pat O'Dea]] against Kennedy's punting.  Kennedy was forced to punt from Chicago's ten-yard line, and Kennedy kicked the ball as he was being thrown to the ground by Wisconsin end [[Eddie Cochems]].  The kick proved to be the longest punt of Kennedy's career.  At the end of the 1899 season, he was selected as a first-team All-American by the ''Philadelphia Inquirer''.<ref>{{cite news|title=An All-American Football Team In Fact, Three of Them, and All Picked upon Different Lines|publisher=The Philadelphia Inquirer|date=1899-12-11}}</ref>  He was selected as an All-Western player at either halfback or quarterback three straight years from 1897 to 1899.<ref name=Thrill/>

===Later years===
After graduating from Chicago, Kennedy went into the newspaper business.  He began his newspaper career as a football writer for the ''Chicago Daily Tribune'' in 1900.<ref name=Obit/>  In 1904, Kennedy moved to [[Albion, Michigan]], where he worked as both a newspaperman and football coach.  He was the publisher of the ''Albion Evening Recorder'' from 1904 to 1939.<ref name=Obit>{{cite news|title=Ex-Chicago Back, 79, Dies; Former Coach|newspaper=Chicago Daily Tribune|date=1954-04-29}}</ref>  He was also the head football coach at [[Albion College]] from 1904 to 1920, leading the team to a 51&ndash;29&ndash;8 record (.625 winning percentage) and four four championships.<ref>{{cite web|title=Football History Albion College|publisher=Albion College|url=http://www2.albion.edu/sports/mens-sports/football/history-mainmenu-275}}</ref>

Kennedy died in Albion, Michigan in 1954 at age 79.<ref name=Obit/>
