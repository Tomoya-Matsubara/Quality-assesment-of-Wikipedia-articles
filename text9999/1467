The '''giant anteater''' ('''''Myrmecophaga tridactyla'''''), also known as the '''ant bear''', is a large [[insectivorous]] [[mammal]] native to [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]]. It is one of four living species of [[anteater]] and is classified with the [[sloth]]s in the [[order (biology)|order]] [[Pilosa]]. This species is the most terrestrial of the living anteaters, unlike its [[arboreal]] or semi-arboreal cousins. Its [[evolution]] may have been influenced by the expansion of [[savanna]]s in South America. The giant anteater is the largest of its family, stretching {{convert|182|<U+2013>|217|cm|ft|abbr=on}} and weighing {{convert|33|<U+2013>|41|kg|lb|abbr=on}} for males and {{convert|27|<U+2013>|39|kg|lb|abbr=on}} for females. It is recognizable by its elongated snout, bushy tail, long foreclaws and distinctively colored [[fur|pelage]].

The anteater can be found in multiple habitats including [[grassland]] and [[rainforest]]. It forages in open areas and rests in more forested habitats. It feeds primarily on [[ant]]s and [[termite]]s, using its foreclaws to dig them up and its long, sticky tongue to collect them. Though giant anteaters live in overlapping [[home range]]s, they are mostly solitary except during mother-offspring relationships, aggressive interactions between males, and when mating. Mother anteaters carry their offspring on their backs until weaning them.

The giant anteater is listed as [[Vulnerable species|Vulnerable]] by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN). It has been [[extirpated]] from some parts of its former range. Threats to its survival include habitat destruction and hunting, though some anteaters inhabit protected areas. Because of its distinctive appearance, the anteater has been featured in [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] [[myth]]s and [[folktale]]s as well as modern [[popular culture]].

==Taxonomy and phylogeny==
[[File:Cambridge Natural History Mammalia Fig 091.jpg|thumb|left|250px|From ''The Cambridge Natural History, Volume X<U+2014>Mammalia'' (1902)]]
The giant anteater got its [[binomial name]] from [[Carl Linnaeus]] in 1758. Its [[name of a biological genus|generic name]], ''Myrmecophaga'', and [[Specific name (zoology)|specific name]], ''tridactyla'', are both Greek, meaning "anteater" and "three fingers" respectively.<ref name=fauna-paraguay>{{cite web|author=Smith, P.|date=2 November 2007|title=Giant Anteater ''Myrmecophaga tridactyla'' Linnaeus, 1758|publisher=Fauna Paraguay.com|accessdate=13 June 2012|url=http://www.faunaparaguay.com/mamm2Myrmecophagatridactyla.pdf}}</ref> Three subspecies have been tentatively proposed: ''M. t. tridactyla'' (ranging from [[Venezuela]] and [[the Guianas]] to northern [[Argentina]]), ''M. t. centralis'' (native to Central America, northwestern [[Colombia]] and northern [[Ecuador]]), and ''M. t. artata'' (native to northeastern Columbia and northwestern Venezuela). The giant anteater is grouped with the semi-[[arboreal]] [[northern tamandua|northern]] and [[southern tamandua]] in the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Myrmecophagidae]]. Together with the family [[Cyclopedidae]], whose only extant member is the arboreal [[silky anteater]], the two families comprise the suborder [[Vermilingua]].<ref name=Gardner>{{cite book|author=Gardner, A.

Anteaters and [[sloth]]s belong to order [[Pilosa]] and share superorder [[Xenarthra]] with [[armadillo]]s (Cingulata). Xenartha split 65 million years ago ([[Mya (unit)#Symbols y and yr|MYA]]) during the [[Late Cretaceous]] [[epoch (geology)|epoch]]. Anteaters and sloths diverged around 55 MYA, between the [[Paleocene]] and [[Eocene]] epochs. The ''Cyclopes'' lineage emerged around 30 MYA in the [[Oligocene]] epoch, while the ''Myrmecophaga'' and ''[[Tamandua]]'' lineages split 10 MYA in the [[Late Miocene]] sub-epoch.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Delsuc, F.; Vizca<U+00ED>no, S.

''Neotamandua'', on the other hand, is unlikely to have had a prehensile tail and its feet were intermediate in form between those of the tamanduas and the giant anteater.<ref name=fossil/> The species ''[[Neotamandua borealis]]'' was suggested to be an ancestor of the latter.<ref>{{cite journal|title=A New Fossil Anteater (Edentata, Mammalia) from Colombia, S.

The giant anteater is the most terrestrial of the living anteater species. Anteaters may originally have been adapted to arboreal life<ref name=Gaudin/> and the evolution of the giant anteater may have been aided by the expansion of open habitats such as savanna in South America and the availability of insects living in [[Colony (biology)|colonies]] there, such as termites, that provided a larger feeding target. Both the giant anteater and the southern tamandua are well represented in the fossil record of the [[late Pleistocene]] and early [[Holocene]].<ref name=fossil/>

[[File:Myrmecophaga tridactyla skeleton2.jpg|thumb|240px|left|Mounted skeleton]]
Unlike other mammals, anteater necks, especially the giant's, are thicker than the backs of their heads.<ref name=Naples/> A small hump can be found at the back of its neck. The giant anteater's coat is mostly grey and salted with white dots.<ref name=fauna-paraguay/> Its forelimbs are white, with black bands around the wrists, while its hind limbs are dark. Thick black bands with white outlines stretch from throat to shoulder, where they end in triangular points. The body ends in a brown tail.<ref name=fauna-paraguay/> The coat hairs are long, especially on the tail, which makes the tail look larger than it actually is. A stiff mane stretches along its back.<ref name=fauna-paraguay/> The giant anteater has a low body temperature for a mammal, being {{convert|33|C|F|0|abbr=on}}, a few degrees lower than typical mammalian temperature of {{convert|36|<U+2013>|38|C|F|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name=ecology/> While adult males are slightly larger and more muscular than females; with wider heads and necks, visual sex determination can be difficult. The (retracted) penis and testes are located internally between the rectum and urinary bladder in males, and females have a single pair of mammary glands near the armpits.<ref name=Grzimek/>

The giant anteater has broad ribs. Despite its specific name, it has five toes on each foot. Four toes on the front feet have claws, which are particularly elongated on the second and third digits.<ref name=Grzimek/> The giant anteater [[Knuckle-walking|walks on its front knuckles]], similar to the African apes, specifically gorillas and chimpanzees. Doing this allows the anteater to keep its claws out of the way while walking. The middle digits, which support most of its weight, are extended at the [[metacarpophalangeal joints]] and bent at the [[Interphalangeal articulations of hand|interphalangeal joints]].<ref name=Orr>{{cite journal|author=Orr C.

===Feeding anatomy===
The anteater has no teeth and is capable of very limited jaw movement. It relies on the rotation of the two halves of its lower jaw, held together by a ligament at the tip,<ref name=Naples/> to open and close its mouth. This is accomplished by its [[muscles of mastication|masticatory muscles]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Endo, H. ''et al.''|year=2007|title=Three-Dimensional CT Examination of the Mastication System in the Giant Anteater|journal=Zoological Science|volume=24|issue=10|pages=1005<U+2013>11|doi=10.2108/zsj.24.1005|pmid=18088164|url=http://repository.kulib.kyoto-u.ac.jp/dspace/bitstream/2433/108571/1/zs24p1005.pdf}}</ref> Jaw depression creates an oral opening large enough for the slender tongue to protrude.<ref name=Naples/> The tongue is typically {{convert|60|cm|in|abbr=on}}<ref name=fauna-paraguay/> long and is triangular posteriorly, rounded anteriorly, and ends in a small rounded tip.<ref name=Naples/> It is covered in backward-curving [[Taste bud|papillae]] and coated in thick, sticky saliva secreted from its enlarged salivary glands,<ref name="MacDonald">{{Cite book|author=Naples, V.|contribution=Anteaters|year=2001|title=The Encyclopedia of Mammals|edition= 2nd|editor=MacDonald, D|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=788<U+2013>91|isbn=0-7607-1969-1}}</ref> which allow the anteater to collect insects with it.

The tube-like [[Rostrum (anatomy)|rostrum]] and the small mouth opening restrict the tongue to protrusion-retraction movements. During feeding, the tongue moves in and out at around 160 times per minute (nearly 3 times per second). These movements are powered by the unique musculature of the anteater's long and flexible [[hyoid apparatus]]. The animal relies on the orientation of its head to aim its tongue. When fully extended, the tongue can reach {{convert|45|cm|in|abbr=on}}; longer than the length of the skull. The [[buccinator]]s allow the tongue to slide back in without losing attached food and tightens the mouth to prevent food from escaping as the tongue protracts. When retracted, the tongue is held in the [[oropharynx]] by the hyoid muscles and the [[secondary palate]], preventing it from blocking [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]]. The tongue's retraction is aided by the long sternoglossus muscle, which is formed by the fusion of the [[sternohyoid]] and the [[hyoglossus]] and does not attach to the hyoid.<ref name=Naples/> Thus, the tongue is directly anchored to the [[sternum]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Feldhamer, G. A. ''et al.''|year=2007|title=Mammalogy: Adaptation, Diversity, Ecology|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|page=121|isbn=0-8018-8695-3}}</ref>

Anteaters swallow at a much higher rate than most other mammals; they do so almost continuously.<ref name=Naples/> Before they are swallowed, insects are crushed against the palate.<ref name="MacDonald"/> The anteater's stomach, similarly to a bird's [[gizzard]], has hardened folds and uses strong contractions to grind the insects. The digestive process is assisted by small amounts of ingested sand and dirt.<ref name=Grzimek>{{Cite book| editor = Hutchins, M.; Kleiman, D. G; Geist, V.; McDade, M. <U+0421>.|author = Naugher, K.

[[File:Myrmecophaga tridactyla.jpg|thumb|240px|left|Sleeping]]
The giant anteater may utilize different habitats. A 2007 study of anteaters at the Brazilian [[Pantanal]] found that the animals generally forage in open areas and rest in forested areas, possibly because forests are warmer than grasslands on cold days and cooler on hot days.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Mour<U+00E3>o, G.; Medri, <U+00CD>.

Giant anteaters typically rest in dense brush but may use tall grass on cooler days. They carve a shallow cavity in the ground for resting. The animal sleeps curled up with its bushy tail folded over its body. The tail serves both to conserve body heat and as [[camouflage]]. One anteater was recorded sleeping with its tail stretched out on a sunny morning with an ambient temperature of {{convert|17|C|F|0|abbr=on}}; possibly it was positioned this way to allow the body to absorb the sun's rays for warmth.<ref name=sleeping>{{cite journal|author=Medri, <U+00CD>.

Anteaters track prey by their scent.<ref name=neotropics/> After finding a nest, the animal tears it open with its long foreclaws and inserts its long, sticky tongue to collect its victims. An anteater spends one minute on average feeding at a nest, visiting up to 200 nests in one day and consuming as many as 300,000 individuals.<ref name=Grzimek/> The anteater may be driven away from a nest by the chemical or biting attacks of soldiers.<ref name=neotropics/> Some termite species rely on their fortified [[termite mound|mound]]s for protection and many individuals escape while the predator digs.<ref name=Redford/> These modes of defense ensure that one attack does not consume an entire colony.<ref name=ecology/>
[[Image:Giant Anteater with child.jpg|thumb|250px|Adult with offspring clinging to her back]]
Other prey include the larvae of [[beetle]]s and [[western honey bee]]s that have located their hives in termite mounds. Anteaters may target termite mounds with bee hives.<ref name=ecology/> In captivity, anteaters are fed mixtures made of milk, eggs, [[mealworms]] and ground beef.<ref name=Nowak/> To drink, an anteater may dig for water when no surface water is available, creating waterholes for other animals.<ref name=Emmons/> Giant anteaters are prey for [[jaguar]]s and [[cougar|puma]]s. They typically flee from danger by galloping but if forced<ref name=Nowak/> will rear up on their hind legs and slash at the attacker.<ref>{{cite book|author=Vaughan, T. A.; Ryan, J.

===Reproduction and parenting===
Giant anteaters can mate throughout the year.<ref name=ecology/> During courtship, a male consorts with an [[estrous]] female, following and sniffing her. Male and female pairs are known to feed at the same insect nest.<ref name=Shaw2/> While mating, the female lies on her side as the male crouches over her. A couple may stay together for up to three days and mate several times during that period.<ref name=ecology/> Gestation lasts around 190 days<ref name=Shaw2/> and ends with the birth of a single pup,<ref name=Grzimek/> which typically weighs around {{convert|1.4|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mammals: Giant Anteater|publisher=San Diego Zoo.org|url=http://www.sandiegozoo.org/animalbytes/t-anteater.html|accessdate=29 July 2012}}</ref> Females give birth standing upright.<ref name=ecology/>

Pups are born with eyes closed and begin to open them after six days. The mother carries its dependant pup on its back.<ref name=Nowak>{{cite book|author=Nowak, R. M.|year=1999|title=Walker's Mammals of the World, Volume 1|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|pages=155<U+2013>56|isbn=0-8018-5789-9}}</ref> The pup's black and white band aligns with its mother's, camouflaging it.<ref name=Grzimek/> The young communicate with their mothers with sharp whistles and use their tongues during nursing. After three months, the pup begins to eat solid food and is fully [[weaned]] by ten months. The mother grooms her offspring during rest periods lasting up to an hour. Grooming peaks during the first three months and declines as the young reaches nine months of age, ending by ten months. The decline mirrors that of the weakening bond between mother and offspring; young anteaters usually become independent by nine or ten months.<ref name=fauna-paraguay/> Anteaters are sexually mature in 2.5<U+2013>4 years.<ref name=Nowak/>

==In culture==

In the [[mythology]] and [[folklore]] of the indigenous peoples of the [[Amazon Basin]], the giant anteater is depicted as a [[trickster]] [[Foil (literature)|foil]] to the [[jaguar]] as well as a humorous figure due to its long snout. In one [[Shipibo-Conibo people|Shipib]] tale, an anteater challenged a jaguar to a breath holding contest underwater, which the jaguar accepted. After the two removed their pelts and submerged, the anteater jumped out of the water and stole the jaguar's pelt, leaving the jaguar with the anteater's pelt. In a Yarabara myth, the evil [[ogre]] Ucara is transformed into one by the [[Solar deity|sun]]. This myth emphasizes the nearly immobile nature of the anteater's mouth which was considered a burden.<ref name=myth>{{cite book|author=Roe, P. G.|year=1982|title=The Cosmic Zygote: Cosmology in the Amazon Basin|publisher=Rutgers University Press|pages=189<U+2013>91|isbn=0-8135-0896-7 }}</ref> The [[Kayapo people]] wear masks of various animals and spirits, including the anteater, during [[Naming ceremony|naming]] and [[initiation]] ceremonies. It is believed that women who touched anteater masks or men who stumbled while wearing them would die or receive some sort of physical disorder.<ref>{{cite book|author=Mascia-Lees, F. E|year=2011|title=A Companion to the Anthropology of the Body and Embodiment|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|url=http://books.google.com/?id=E1YWvMi6NosC&pg=PT138&dq=Kayapo+anteater+masks#v=snippet&q=anteater&f=false|isbn=978-1-4051-8949-1}}</ref>

During the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]], the giant anteater was one of many native fauna taken to Europe for display. At first, Europeans believed that all anteaters were female and mated with their noses, a misconception corrected by naturalist [[F<U+00E9>lix de Azara]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Cowie, H|year=2011|title=Sloth bones and anteater tongues: Collecting American nature in the Hispanic world (1750<U+2013>1808)|journal=Atlantic Studies|volume=8|issue=1|pages=5<U+2013>27|doi=10.1080/14788810.2011.540864}}</ref> In the 20th century, [[Salvador Dal<U+00ED>]] wrote imaginatively that the giant anteater "reaches sizes bigger than the horse, possesses enormous ferocity, has exceptional muscle power, is a terrifying animal." Dal<U+00ED> depicted an anteater in the style of ''[[The Great Masturbator]]''. It was used as a [[bookplate]] for [[Andr<U+00E9> Breton]], who compared the temptations a man experiences in life to what "the tongue of the anteater must offer to the ant."<ref name=Dali>{{cite book|author=Fan<U+00E9>s, F.|year=2007|title=Salvador Dali: The Construction of the Image, 1925<U+2013>1930|publisher=Yale University Press|page=132|isbn=978-0-300-09179-3}}</ref>

The 1940 [[Max Fleischer]] cartoon ''[[Ants in the Plants]]'' features a colony of ants fighting off a villainous anteater. Released during the [[Phoney War]], the film may have alluded to France's [[Maginot Line]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Shull, M. S.; Wilt, D.

(comic strip)|B.C.]]. This character was the inspiration for Peter the Anteater, the [[University of California, Irvine]] [[UC Irvine Anteaters|team]] mascot.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Anteater Mascot|publisher=Anteater Chronicles: The UC Irvine Story|url=http://www.lib.uci.edu/ucihistory/index.php?page=students&function=anteater|accessdate=25 June 2012}}</ref> The [[Flash cartoon]] ''[[Happy Tree Friends]]'' features an anteater named [[Sniffles (Happy Tree Friends)|Sniffles]]. In the [[Stephen King]] mini-series ''[[Kingdom Hospital]]'', the character Antubis appears in the form of an anteater-like creature with razor sharp teeth.<ref>{{cite book|author=Browning, M.|year=2011|title=Stephen King on the Small Screen|publisher=Intellect Books|page=122|isbn=978-1-84150-412-4}}</ref>
