The '''Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe''' (TCE), commonly referred to as the '''European Constitution''', was an international [[treaty]] intended to create a [[constitution]] for the [[European Union]]. It would have replaced the existing [[Treaties of the European Union]] with a single text, given limited legal force to the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights]] (which was incorporated into the Constitution), and expanded [[Qualified Majority Voting]] into policy areas which had previously been decided by unanimity among member states.

It was signed in 2004 by representatives of the then 25 member states of the European Union and needed to be ratified by all member states to enter into force. 13 member states completed the ratification procedure, but the rejection of the Constitution by French and Dutch voters in May and June 2005, called the future of the Constitution into question. In light of these developments three member states, Finland, Germany and Slovakia, abandoned their partially complete ratification procedures and a further seven member states indefinitely postponed consideration.

Following the period of reflection, the [[European Council]] meeting in June 2007 decided to start negotiations on a new reform treaty as a replacement. This treaty was later named [[Lisbon Treaty]]. It has been ratified by most member states.

===Drafting===
{{double image|right|Val<U+00E9>ry Giscard d<U+2019>Estaing 1978.jpg|150|Prodi Heiligendamm G8 2007 001 crop.jpg|150|[[Val<U+00E9>ry Giscard d<U+2019>Estaing]], President of the [[European Convention]]|[[Romano Prodi]], [[President of the European Commission]], 1999-2004}}

The drafting for European Constitution began in a call for a new debate on the future of Europe at the [[List of European Councils#Laken 2001|Laeken European Council]] in December 2001. A [[European Convention]] was founded shortly afterwards which was chaired by former French President [[Val<U+00E9>ry Giscard d'Estaing]]. Giscard d'Estaing proposed to draft a Constitution. [[Romano Prodi]], the [[President of the European Commission]] backed a draft text, called [[Penelope Project]], which contained a deeper integration of the countries and a more clear institutional model.<ref>[http://www.politicainternazionale.it/file%20PDF/A&T%201.2003%20-%20en/2.pdf Penelope project on constitution]</ref>

After protracted negotiations in the [[Intergovernmental Conference]] (IGC) during Italian presidency, disputes arose over the proposed framework for [[qualified majority voting]]: the final text of the TCE was settled in June 2004 under the [[Republic of Ireland|Irish]] presidency.

===Signing and ratification===
The ''Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe'' was signed in [[Rome]] on 29 October 2004 by 53 senior political figures from the 25 [[European Union member states|member states]] of the [[European Union]]. In most cases [[head of state|heads of state]] designated [[plenipotentiary|plenipotentiaries]] to sign the treaty, but some [[president]]s also signed on behalf of states which were [[republic]]s. Most designated plenipotentiaries were [[prime minister]]s and [[foreign minister]]s.

On 12 January 2005 the [[European Parliament]] voted a legally non-binding resolution in support of the Constitution by 500 votes in favour to 137 votes against, with 40 abstentions.<ref>[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/omk/sipade3?PUBREF=-//EP//TEXT+PRESS+DN-20050112-1+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN&LEVEL=4&NAV=S&L=EN#SECTION1 European Parliament results]</ref>

Before a EU treaty can enter into force, it must be ratified by all member states. Ratification takes different forms in each country, depending on its traditions, constitutional arrangements and political processes. Most member states traditionally ratify EU treaties following parliamentary votes, while some <U+2014> notably Ireland and Denmark <U+2014> also hold referendums. As a reaction to what was seen as the novel nature of the Constitution, many advocates and opponents of the Constitution argued that it should be subjected to Referendums across the European Union.<ref>{{cite |title=Ratification problems loom over Convention |author=Honor Mahony |newspaper=[[EUObserver.com]] |date=31 May 2003 |accessdate=27 February 2009 |url=http://euobserver.com/9/11481}}; {{cite |title=Giscard backs calls for referendum on EU constitution |author=Sarah Hall |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=26 May 2003 |accessdate=27 February 2009 |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2003/may/26/uk.eu}}; {{cite |title=Tories issue demand on Europe referendum |author=David Charter |newspaper=[[The Times]] |date=21 October 2003 |accessdate=27 February 2009 |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article997751.ece}}.</ref>

{{legend|#C22929|No - Referendum}}
{{legend|#FEBBBB|Referendum postponed indefinitely}}
{{legend|#00AAE2|No referendum was proposed}}]]

On 20 April 2004 then British Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] unexpectedly promised a referendum, a proposal which he had previously rejected. A further seven member states announced or had already announced that they would hold referendums on the Constitution. These being [[Denmark]], [[France]], [[Ireland]], [[Luxembourg]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]].

[[Spain]] was the first country to hold a referendum on the Constitution. [[Spanish European Constitution referendum, 2005|The referendum]] approved the Constitution by 76% of the votes, although participation was only around 43%.

On 29 May 2005 the French public [[French European Constitution referendum, 2005|rejected the Constitution]] by margin of 55% to 45% on a turn out of 69%. And just three days later the Dutch rejected the constitution by a margin of 61% to 39% on a turnout of 62%.

Notwithstanding the rejection in France and the Netherlands, [[Luxembourg]] held a referendum on 10 July 2005 approving the Constitution by 57% to 43%. It was the last referendum to be held on the Constitution as all of the other member states that has proposed to hold referendums cancelled them.

===Post-rejection===
After the French and Dutch referendum results European leaders decided to hold a "period of reflection" on what to do next.<ref>{{cite |http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2005/jun/17/eu.politics |author=Patrick Wintour |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=17 June 2005 |accessdate=27 February 2009}}.</ref> As part of this reflection period a "group of wise men" was set up to consider possible courses of action.<ref>{{cite web |title=Select group of politicians to tackle EU constitution |author=Honor Mahony |newspaper=EUobserver.com |date=28 September 2006 |accessdate=27 February 2009 |url=http://euobserver.com/9/22527}}</ref>

On 4 June 2007, this group, known as the [[Amato Group]], presented its report. They proposed to establish a new Inter-Governmental Conference with a view to writing a new treaty which would rewrite the [[Treaty on European Union]], amend the [[Treaty establishing the European Community]] and give the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]] a legally binding status. The new treaty would be based on the first and fourth parts of the Constitution, the rest of the Constitutions changes being achieved through amendments to the Treaty of Rome.<ref>{{cite |title=A New Treaty and Supplementary Protocols - Explanatory Memorandum |publisher=Action Committee for European Democracy |place=Brussels |page=2 |date=4 June 2007 |url=http://www.eui.eu/RSCAS/e-texts/ACED2007_NewTreatyMemorandum-04_06.pdf |accessdate=27 February 2009}}.</ref>

In the June 2007 [[European summit]] meeting, Member States agreed to abandon the constitution and to amend the existing treaties, which would remain in force. They also agreed a detailed mandate for a new intergovernmental conference to negotiate a new treaty containing such amendments to the existing treaties (primarily the Treaty of Rome and the Treaty of Maastricht). These negotiations were completed by the end of the year, the new treaty which had previously been referred to as the ''Reform Treaty'' become the [[Lisbon Treaty]] on its signing in [[Lisbon]] on 13 December 2007.

===Institutional structure===
Under the TCE, the [[Council of the European Union]] would have been formally renamed the "Council of Ministers", which is already its informal title. The "General Affairs Council" would have been formally split from the "Foreign Affairs Council", which had informally held meetings separately since June 2002.

The TCE included a [[European flag|flag]], an [[European anthem|anthem]] and a [[European symbols#Motto|motto]], which had previously not had treaty recognition, although none of them are new.

===Conferral, subsidiarity, proportionality===
The TCE would have reiterated several key principles of how the Union functions: 

* the [[principle of conferral]]: that all EU competences are conferred on it voluntarily by member states;
* the [[principle of subsidiarity]]: that governmental decisions should be taken at the lowest level possible while still remaining effective;
* the [[Proportionality (political maxim)|principle of proportionality]]: that the EU may only act to exactly the extent that is needed to achieve its objectives;
* the primacy of EU law: in areas where member states have made legally binding agreements at EU level, they may not then pass national laws incompatible with those EU laws.

The TCE would have specified that the EU is a union of member states, and that all its competences (areas of responsibility) are voluntarily conferred on it by its member states according to the [[principle of conferral]]. The EU would have no competences by right, and thus any areas of policy not explicitly specified in the Constitution would have remained the domain of the sovereign member states (notwithstanding the <U+2018>flexibility clause' &ndash; see below).

According to the TCE, the EU may act (i.e. make laws) only where its member states agree unanimously that actions by individual countries would be insufficient. This is the [[principle of subsidiarity]], and is based on the legal and political principle that governmental decisions should be taken as close to the people as possible while still remaining effective. It is a main argument against claims that Europe limits national [[sovereignty]] but critics say that it is a principle to which lip service only is paid, and, in practice, the reach of the EU has been increasingly ambitious.

===Primacy of Union law===
Amongst European countries, the [[European Court of Justice]] has consistently ruled since 1964 that EU law has primacy over the laws of member states in the areas where member states allow it to legislate. National law which is incompatible with an agreement already made at European level is deemed to be 'disapplied' when questions arise in courts. This controversial and fundamental principle of European Community law was first recognised in the case of ''[[Van Gend en Loos]]'' in 1963 which was followed in ''[[Costa v. ENEL]]'' in 1964.

===Common values of the Union's member states===
As stated in [[wikisource:Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe: Part I#Article I-1: Establishment of the Union|Articles I-1]] and [[wikisource:Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe: Part I#Article I-2: The Union.27s values|I-2]], the Union is open to all European States that respect the member states' common values, namely:
* human [[dignity]]
* [[freedom (political)|freedom]]
* [[democracy]]
* [[social equality|equality]]
* the [[rule of law]]
* respect for [[human rights]]
* [[minority]] rights
* [[free market]]

Member states also declare that the following principles prevail in their society:
* [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism]]
* non-[[discrimination]]
* [[tolerance]]
* [[justice]]
* [[solidarity (sociology)|solidarity]]
* equality of the [[sex]]es

Some of these provisions are codified for the first time in the TCE.

===Aims of the Union===
The aims of the EU, according to the TCE, are made explicit ([[wikisource:Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe: Part I#Article I-3: The Union.27s objectives|Article I-3]]):
* promotion of [[peace]], its values and the well-being of its people
* maintenance of freedom, [[security]] and justice without internal borders, and an internal [[market]] where [[competition]] is free and undistorted
* [[sustainable development]] based on balanced [[economic growth]] and [[price stability]], a highly competitive [[social market economy]]
* [[social justice]] and protection, equality between women and men, solidarity between generations and protection of the rights of the child
* economic, social and territorial cohesion, and solidarity among member states
* respect for [[language|linguistic]] and [[culture|cultural]] diversity

In its relations with the wider world the Union's objectives are:
* to uphold and promote its values and interests
* to contribute to peace, security, the sustainable development of the [[Earth]]
* solidarity and mutual respect among people
* [[free trade|free]] and [[fair trade|fair]] [[trade]]
* eradication of [[poverty]] and the protection of human rights, in particular the rights of the child
* strict observance and development of [[international law]], including respect for the principles of the [[United Nations]] [[United Nations Charter|Charter]].

===Scope of the Union===
====Competences====
The EU has six ''exclusive competences'', policy areas in which member states have agreed that they should act exclusively through the EU and not legislate at a national level. The list remains unchanged from the previous treaties:
* [[customs union]];
* those competition rules that govern the internal market;
* [[Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union|eurozone]] monetary policy;
* conservation of marine biological resources (the [[Common Fisheries Policy]]);
* common commercial policy;
* the conclusion of certain limited international agreements.

There are a number of ''shared competences''. These are areas in which member states agree to act individually only where they have not already acted through the EU, or where the EU has ceased to act (though these are areas where member states may act both nationally and through the EU if they wish). Three new competences have been added to those in previous treaties (see below).

There are a number of areas where the EU may take only ''supporting, coordinating or complementary action''. In these areas, member states do not confer any competences on the Union, but they agree to act through the Union in order to support their work at national level. Again, three new competences have been added to those from previous treaties (see below).

====Flexibility clause====
The TCE's flexibility clause allows the EU to act in areas not made explicit in the TCE, but only:
* if all member states agree;
* with the consent of the [[European Parliament]]; and
* where this is necessary to achieve an agreed objective under the TCE.

This clause has been present in EU law since the original [[Treaty of Rome]], which established the EEC in 1958.

====Common foreign and security policy====
The EU is charged with defining and implementing a '''[[common foreign and security policy]]''' in due time. The wording of this article is taken from the existing [[Treaty on European Union]].

==New provisions==
===Legal personality===
The European Union for the first time has [[Juristic person|legal personality]] under the TCE. This means that it is able to represent itself as a single body in certain circumstances under [[international law]]. Most significantly, it is able to sign treaties as a single body where all its member states agree.

===New competences===
The TCE would have conferred upon the EU as new 'shared competences' the areas of territorial cohesion, energy, and space. These are areas where the EU may act alongside its individual member states. The EU has conferred upon it as new areas of 'supporting, coordinating or complementary action' the areas of tourism, sport, and administrative co-operation.

===Criminal justice proceedings===
Member states would have continued to co-operate in some areas of criminal judicial proceedings where they agree to do so, as at present. Under the TCE, seven new areas of co-operation would have been added:

* [[Child abuse]]
* [[Political corruption|corruption]]
* [[fraud]]
* [[Human trafficking]]
* [[Illegal drug trade|drug trafficking]]
* [[terrorism]]
* [[Trafficking of arms]]

===Solidarity clause===
The new solidarity clause of the TCE specifies that any member state which falls victim to a terrorist attack or other disaster will receive assistance from other member states, if it requests it. The type of assistance to be offered is not specified. Instead, the arrangements will be decided by the [[Council of the European Union|Council of Ministers]] should the situation arise.

===European Public Prosecutor===
Provision exists for the creation of a [[European Public Prosecutor]]'s Office, if all member states agree to it and if the [[European Parliament]] gives its consent.

===Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union===
{{main article|Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union}}
The TCE includes a copy of the Charter already agreed to by all EU member states. This is included in the Constitution so that EU institutions themselves are obliged to conform to the same standards of fundamental rights.  At the time of the Charter's original agreement, the British Government said that it did not have binding effect.  Incorporation into TCE would have put its importance beyond doubt.

===Simplification===
====Simplified jargon and legal instruments====
The TCE makes an effort to simplify [[jargon]] and reduce the number of EU legal instruments (ways in which EU countries may act). However, it is a long document couched in obscure and technical terms, which proved unpopular when presented (for example) to French voters in their referendum on the TCE.

The TCE unifies legal instruments across areas of policy (referred to as [[pillars of the European Union]] in previous treaties). Specifically:
* 'European Regulations' (of the Community pillar) and 'Decisions' (of the [[Police and Judicial Co-operation in Criminal Matters]] (PJC) pillar) both become referred to as European laws.
* 'European Directives' (of the Community pillar) and 'Framework Decisions' (of the PJC pillar) both become referred to as European framework laws.
* 'Conventions' (of the PJC pillar) are done away with, replaced in every case by either European laws or European framework laws.
* '[[Joint action]]s' and 'Common positions' (of what is now the [[Common Foreign and Security Policy]] Pillar) are both replaced by Decisions.

====Position of Union Minister for Foreign Affairs====
Under the TCE, the present role of [[High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy]] would be  amalgamated with the role of the [[Commissioner for External Relations]]. This would create a new [[Union Minister for Foreign Affairs]] who would also be a Vice President of the Commission. This individual would be responsible for co-ordinating foreign policy across the Union, representing the EU abroad in areas where member states agree to speak with one voice.

===Functioning of the institutions===
====Qualified majority voting====
More day-to-day decisions in the [[Council of the European Union|Council of Ministers]] would be to be taken by [[qualified majority voting]], requiring a 55% majority of members of the Council representing a 65% majority of citizens. (The 55% is raised to 72% when the Council acts on its own initiative rather than on a legislative proposal from the Commission or the Union Minister for Foreign Affairs.) The unanimous agreement of all member states would only be required for decisions on more sensitive issues, such as tax, social security, foreign policy and defense.

====President of the European Council====
The six-month rotating Presidency of the [[European Council]] would switch to a chair chosen by the heads of government, in office for 2<U+00BD> years and renewable once. The role itself would remain administrative and non-executive, but rather than the Presidency being held by a member state as at present, it would be held by an individual elected by and accountable to the Council.

====President of the Council of Ministers====
The six-month rotating Presidency of the [[Council of the European Union|Council of Ministers]], which currently coincides with the Presidency of the [[European Council]], would be changed to an 18-month rotating Presidency shared by a trio of member countries, in an attempt to provide more continuity. The exception would be the Council's Foreign Affairs configuration, which would be chaired by the newly-created Union Minister for Foreign Affairs.

====Smaller Commission====
The [[European Commission|Commission]] would be reduced in size from 27 to 18 by the year 2014. There would be fewer Commissioners, with member states taking it in turn to nominate Commissioners two times out of three.

===Parliamentary power and transparency===
* '''President of the Commission''': The candidate for [[President of the European Commission]] would be proposed by the [[European Council]], after consultation with [[Member of the European Parliament|MEPs]], and would  be elected by the [[European Parliament]]. Parliament would have the final say.
* '''Parliament as co-legislature''': The [[European Parliament]] would acquire equal legislative power under the [[codecision procedure]] with the Council in virtually all areas of policy. Previously, it had this power in most cases but not all.
* '''Meeting in public''': The [[Council of the European Union|Council of Ministers]] would be required to meet in public when debating all new laws. Currently, it meets in public only for texts covered under the [[Codecision procedure]].
* '''Budget''':  The final say over the EU's annual budget would be given to the [[European Parliament]]. Agricultural spending would no longer be ring-fenced, and would be brought under the Parliament's control.
* '''Role of national parliaments''':  [[List of European Union member states by political system#Listed by type of parliament|Member states' national parliaments]] would be given a new role in scrutinising proposed EU laws, and would be entitled to object if they feel a proposal oversteps the boundary of the Union's agreed areas of responsibility. If the Commission wishes to ignore such an objection, it would be forced to submit an explanation to the parliament concerned and to the Council of Ministers.
* '''Popular mandate (aka [[initiative]])''': The Commission would be invited to consider any proposal "on matters where citizens consider that a legal act of the Union is required for the purpose of implementing the Constitution" which has the support of one million citizens. The mechanism by which this would be put into practice has yet to be agreed. (See [[wikisource:Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe: Part I#Article I-46: The principle of representative democracy|Article I-46(4)]] for details.)

===Further integration, amendment and withdrawal===
====Enhanced co-operation====
There would be a tightening of existing rules for 'enhanced cooperation', where some member states would have chosen to act together more closely and others not. A minimum of one third of member states would now be forced to participate in any enhanced cooperation, and the agreement of the [[European Parliament]] is needed. The option for enhanced cooperation would also be widened to all areas of agreed EU policy.

====Treaty revisions====
Previously, alteration of treaties was decided by unanimous agreement of the [[European Council]] in private meeting.  Proponents of the TCE claim that any amendments to the Constitutional treaty will involve the convening of a new Convention, similar to that chaired by [[Val<U+00E9>ry Giscard d'Estaing]] in drafting the TCE. This process may be bypassed if the [[European Parliament]] agrees, in which case, the final say on adopting proposals will rest with the European Council, who must agree unanimously. However, small revisions (switching from unanimity voting to [[qualified majority voting]] in specific policy areas) can be made by the [[European Council]] through the so-called 'Passerelle Clause' ([[wikisource:Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe: Part IV &ndash; General and Final Provisions#Article IV-444: Simplified revision procedure|Article IV-444]]) if every member state agrees.

====Withdrawal clause====
A new clause in the TCE allows for the withdrawal of any member state without renegotiation of the TCE or violation of treaty commitments (clause I-60).  Under this clause, when a country notifies the Council of its intent to withdraw, a settlement is agreed in the Council with the consent of Parliament. If negotiations are not agreed within two years, the country leaves anyway. The process described is a formalisation of the process which [[Greenland]] used to leave the [[European Community|EC]] in 1985.
