'''Melvin Jerome''' "'''Mel'''" '''Blanc''' (May 30, 1908 <U+2013> July 10, 1989) was an American [[Voice acting|voice actor]], comedian, and [[radio personality]]. Although he began his sixty-plus-year career performing in [[radio]], Blanc is best remembered for his work with [[Warner Bros.]] as the voices of [[Bugs Bunny]], [[Daffy Duck]], [[Porky Pig]], [[Tweety|Tweety Bird]], [[Sylvester (Looney Tunes)|Sylvester the Cat]], [[Yosemite Sam]], [[Foghorn Leghorn]], [[Marvin the Martian]], [[Pep<U+00E9> Le Pew]], [[Speedy Gonzales]], [[Wile E. Coyote and The Road Runner|Wile E. Coyote]], the [[Tasmanian Devil (Looney Tunes)|Tasmanian Devil]] and many of the other characters from the ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' and ''[[Merrie Melodies]]'' [[Animated cartoon|cartoon]] [[short film]]s, produced during the [[golden age of American animation]].<ref name="BTVA">{{cite web | url = http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/Mel-Blanc/ | title = Mel Blanc | accessdate = 2013-02-05 | publisher = Behind the Voice Actors}}</ref>

He later worked for [[Hanna-Barbera]]'s [[television]] cartoons, most notably as the voices of [[Barney Rubble]] in ''[[The Flintstones]]'' and [[List of The Jetsons characters#Mr. Spacely|Mr. Spacely]] in ''[[The Jetsons]]''. Blanc was also a regular performer on ''[[The Jack Benny Program]]'' in both its radio and television formats (among various other radio and TV programs), and was the original voice of [[Woody Woodpecker]] for [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]].<ref name="BTVA"/>

Having earned the nickname "The Man of a Thousand Voices", Blanc is regarded as one of the most influential people in the voice acting industry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ochcom.org/blanc|title=Mel Blanc's bio at Ochcom.org|publisher=|accessdate=20 October 2014}}</ref>

==Early life==
Blanc was born '''Melvin Jerome Blank''' in [[San Francisco]], [[California]], to [[History of the Jews in Russia|Russian-Jewish]] parents Frederick and Eva Blank. The younger of two children, he grew up in the neighborhood of [[Western Addition]] in [[San Francisco]], and later in [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[Oregon]], where he attended [[Lincoln High School (Portland, Oregon)|Lincoln High School]]. Growing up, he had a fondness for voices and dialect, which he began voicing at the age of ten.  He claimed when he was sixteen, he changed the spelling from "Blank" to "Blanc," because a teacher told him that he would amount to nothing and be like his name, a "blank."  Blanc joined [[DeMolay International|The Order of DeMolay]] as a young man, and was eventually inducted into its Hall of Fame.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.demolay.org/aboutdemolay/halloffame_bio.php?hofid=11|title=DeMolay Hall of Fame|author=DeMolay International|publisher=|accessdate=20 October 2014}}</ref> After graduating high school in 1927, he split his time between leading an orchestra, becoming the youngest conductor in the country at the age of 19, and performing [[shtick]] in [[vaudeville]] shows around Washington, Oregon, and northern California.<ref name="Blanc">{{Cite book|last=Blanc|first=Mel|first2=Philip|last2=Bashe|title=That's Not All, Folks!|location=Clayton South, VIC, Australia|publisher=Warner Books|year=1989|isbn=0-446-51244-3}}</ref>

==Career==

===Radio work===
Blanc began his [[radio]] career at the age of 19 when in 1927 he debuted as a voice actor on the [[KGW]] program ''The Hoot Owls'', where his ability to provide voices for multiple characters first attracted attention. He moved to Los Angeles in 1932, where he met Estelle Rosenbaum (1909 - 2003), whom he married a year later, before returning to Portland. He moved to [[KEX (AM)|KEX]] in 1933 to produce and co-host his ''Cobweb And Nuts'' show with his wife Estelle, which debuted on June 15. The program played Monday through Saturday from 11:00 pm to midnight, and by the time the show ended two years later, it appeared from 10:30 pm to 11:00 pm.

With his wife's encouragement, Blanc returned to Los Angeles and joined [[Warner Bros.]]-owned [[KFWB]] in [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood, California]], in 1935. He joined ''The Johnny Murray Show'', but the following year switched to [[CBS]] Radio and ''The [[Joe Penner]] Show''.

[[File:Jack Benny group photo.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The cast of ''[[The Jack Benny Program]]'', from left to right: [[Eddie Anderson (comedian)|Eddie Anderson]], [[Dennis Day]], [[Phil Harris]], [[Mary Livingstone]], [[Jack Benny]], [[Don Wilson (announcer)|Don Wilson]] and Mel Blanc.]]
Blanc was a regular on the [[NBC]] Red Network show ''[[The Jack Benny Program]]'' in various roles, including voicing Benny's [[Maxwell automobile]] (in desperate need of a tune-up), violin teacher Professor LeBlanc, Polly the Parrot, Benny's pet polar bear Carmichael, the tormented department store clerk, and the train announcer (see below). The first role came from a mishap when the recording of the automobile's sounds failed to play on cue, prompting Blanc to take the microphone and improvise the sounds himself. The audience reacted so positively that Benny decided to dispense with the recording altogether and have Blanc continue in that role. One of Blanc's most memorable characters from Benny's radio (and later TV) programs was "Sy, the Little Mexican", who spoke one word at a time. The famous "S<U+00ED>...Sy...sew...Sue" routine was so effective that no matter how many times it was performed, the laughter was always there, thanks to the comedic timing of Blanc and Benny.<ref>{{YouTube|vIa7GYstYOQ|Video of Mel and Jack with one version of the Sy The Little Mexican routine}}</ref>

By 1946, Blanc appeared on over 15 radio programs in supporting roles. His success on ''[[The Jack Benny Program]]'' led to his own radio show on the [[CBS Radio Network]], ''[[The Mel Blanc Show]]'', which ran from September 3, 1946, to June 24, 1947. Blanc played himself as the hapless owner of a fix-it shop, as well as his young cousin Zookie.

Blanc also appeared on such other national radio programs as ''The [[Abbott and Costello]] Show'', the Happy Postman on ''[[Burns and Allen]]'', and as August Moon on ''Point Sublime''. During [[World War II]], he appeared as Private Sad Sack on various radio shows, most notably ''G.I. Journal''. Blanc recorded a song titled "Big Bear Lake."

===Animation voice work during the golden age of Hollywood===
[[File:Private Snafu - Spies.ogv|thumb|[[Private Snafu]]: ''[[Spies (1943 film)|Spies]]'', voiced by Blanc in 1943]]
In December 1936, Mel Blanc joined [[Warner Bros. Cartoons#1933-1944: Leon Schlesinger Productions|Leon Schlesinger Productions]], which was producing theatrical cartoon shorts for [[Warner Bros.]] After sound man [[Treg Brown]] was put in charge of cartoon voices, and [[Carl Stalling]] became music director, Brown introduced Blanc to animation directors [[Tex Avery]], [[Bob Clampett]], [[Friz Freleng]], and [[Frank Tashlin]], who loved his voices. The first cartoon Blanc worked on was 1937's ''[[Picador Porky]]'' as the voice of a drunken bull.<ref name="Blanc"/> He soon after received his first starring role when he replaced [[Joe Dougherty]] as [[Porky Pig]]'s voice in ''[[Porky's Duck Hunt]]'', which marked the debut of [[Daffy Duck]], also voiced by Blanc.

Following this, Blanc became a very prominent vocal artist for Warner Bros., voicing a wide variety of the ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' characters. [[Bugs Bunny]] (whom Blanc made his debut as in 1940's ''[[A Wild Hare]]''<ref>[[Michael Barrier (historian)|Barrier, Michael]] (2003), [http://www.amazon.com/dp/0195167295 ''Hollywood Cartoons: American Animation in Its Golden Age''], Oxford University Press. ISBN 978-0-19-516729-0</ref><ref name="Bugs Bunny 1990">Adamson, Joe (1990). ''Bugs Bunny: 50 Years and Only One Grey Hare''. New York: Henry Holt. ISBN 978-0-8050-1190-6</ref>) was known for eating [[carrot]]s frequently. To follow this sound with the animated voice, Blanc would bite into a carrot and then quickly spit into a [[spittoon]]. One oft-repeated story is that Blanc was allergic to carrots. However, Blanc denied having any allergy.<ref>[[Tim Lawson (writer)|Tim Lawson]], ''The Magic Behind The Voices: A Who's Who of Cartoon Voice Actors'' University Press of Mississippi, 2004</ref><ref>[http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2820/did-mel-blanc-hate-carrots "Did Mel Blanc hate carrots?"] A Straight Dope column by Science Advisory Board Member Rico November 4, 2008 (accessed November 20, 2008)</ref>

In [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]'', Blanc was hired to perform the voice of Gideon the Cat. However, it was eventually decided that Gideon would be a mute character (similar to Dopey from ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]''), so all of Blanc's recorded dialogue was subsequently deleted except for a solitary hiccup, which was heard three times in the finished film.<ref>''No Strings Attached: The Making of Pinocchio'', Pinocchio DVD, 2009</ref> Blanc also originated the voice (and laugh) of [[Woody Woodpecker]] for the theatrical cartoons produced by [[Walter Lantz Productions|Walter Lantz]] for [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]], but stopped voicing the character after he was signed to an exclusive contract with Warner Bros.<ref name="Blanc"/> During World War II, Blanc served as the voice of the hapless [[Private Snafu]] in various war-themed animated shorts.<ref name="looney.goldenagecartoons.com">{{cite web| work = Looney | url = http://looney.goldenagecartoons.com/miscelooneyous/snafu/ |title=Misce-Looney-Ous: Situation Normal All Fouled Up |publisher= Golden age cartoons | accessdate=2012-02-20}}</ref>

Throughout his career, Blanc was well aware of his talents and protected the rights to them contractually and legally. He, and later his estate, did not hesitate to take civil action when those rights were violated. Voice actors at the time usually got no screen credits at all, but Blanc was a notable exception; by 1944, his contract with Warner Bros. stipulated a credit reading "Voice characterization(s) by Mel Blanc." Blanc asked for and received this screen credit from studio boss [[Leon Schlesinger]] when Schlesinger objected to giving Blanc a pay raise.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://movies2.nytimes.com/gst/movies/filmography.html?p_id=6641|title=''New York Times'' filmography|publisher=|accessdate=25 November 2014}}</ref>

===Voice work for Hanna-Barbera and others===
In 1960, after the expiration of his exclusive contract with Warner Bros., Blanc continued working for WB, but also began providing voices for the TV cartoons produced by [[Hanna-Barbera]]; his most famous roles during this time were [[Barney Rubble]] of ''[[The Flintstones]]'' and [[List of The Jetsons characters#Mr. Spacely|Cosmo Spacely]] of ''[[The Jetsons]]''. His other notable voice roles for Hanna-Barbara included [[Dino (The Flintstones)|Dino the Dinosaur]], [[Secret Squirrel]], [[Speed Buggy]] and [[Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels|Captain Caveman]], as well as voices for ''[[Wally Gator]]'' and ''[[The Perils of Penelope Pitstop]].''

Blanc also worked with former ''Looney Tunes'' director [[Chuck Jones]], who by this time was directing shorts with his own company Sib Tower 12 (later [[MGM Animation]]) doing vocal effects in the ''[[Tom and Jerry]]'' series from 1963 to 1967.  Blanc was the first voice of [[Toucan Sam]] in [[Froot Loops]] commercials.

Blanc reprised some of his Warner Bros. characters when the studio contracted him to make [[DePatie-Freleng Enterprises|new theatrical cartoons]] in the mid-to-late 1960s. For these, Blanc voiced Daffy Duck and [[Speedy Gonzales]], the characters who received the most frequent use in these shorts (later, newly introduced characters such as Cool Cat and Merlin the Magic Mouse were voiced by [[Larry Storch]]). Blanc also continued to voice the Looney Tunes for the bridging sequences of ''[[The Bugs Bunny Show]]'', as well as in numerous animated advertisements and several compilation features, such as ''[[The Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Movie]]''.

===Car accident and aftermath===
On January 24, 1961, Blanc was involved in a near-fatal car accident, as he was going to a studio to work on a commercial. He was driving alone when his sports car [[head-on collision|collided head-on]] with a car driven by 18-year-old college student Arthur Rolston on [[Sunset Boulevard]]. Blanc was rushed to the [[UCLA Medical Center]] with a triple skull fracture that left him in a [[coma]] for two weeks, along with sustaining fractures to both legs and the pelvis.<ref name="bio">''That's Not All, Folks!'', 1988, by Mel Blanc and Philip Bashe.

Blanc returned home on March 17. Four days later, Blanc filed a US$500,000 lawsuit against the city of Los Angeles.  His accident, one of 26 in the preceding two years at the intersection known as [[Dead Man's Curve#Other sharp curves|Dead Man's Curve]], resulted in the city funding restructuring curves at the location.

Years later, Blanc revealed that during his recovery, his son [[Noel Blanc|Noel]] "ghosted" several Warner Bros. cartoons' voice tracks for him. Warner Bros. had also asked [[Stan Freberg]] to provide the voice for Bugs Bunny, but Freberg declined, out of respect for Blanc. At the time of the accident Blanc was also serving as the voice of Barney Rubble in ''The Flintstones.''  His absence from the show would be relatively brief; [[Daws Butler]] provided the voice of Barney for a few episodes, after which the show's producers set up recording equipment in Blanc's hospital room and later at his home to allow him to work from there. Some of the recordings were made while he was in full-body cast as he lay flat on his back with the other ''Flintstones'' co-stars gathered around him.<ref>[http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1828&dat=19880904&id=EsMnAAAAIBAJ&sjid=cL4EAAAAIBAJ&pg=1214,1135635 "Blanc laments lack of cartoon quality"]</ref> He also returned to ''The Jack Benny Program'' to film the program's 1961 Christmas show, moving around via [[crutch]]es and a [[wheelchair]].

==Later career==
[[File:Mel Blanc 1976 2.jpg|thumb|left|Blanc circa 1976]]
In the 1970s, Blanc gave a series of college lectures across the US and appeared in commercials for [[American Express]]. He would also collaborate on a special with the Boston-based Shriners Burns Institute called ''Ounce of Prevention,'' which became a 30-minute TV special.

Throughout the 1980s, Blanc performed his Looney Tunes characters for bridging sequences in various compilation films of Golden-Age era Warner Bros. cartoons, such as ''[[The Looney Looney Looney Bugs Bunny Movie]]'', ''[[Bugs Bunny's 3rd Movie: 1001 Rabbit Tales]]'', ''[[Daffy Duck's Fantastic Island]]'' and ''[[Daffy Duck's Quackbusters]]''.

After spending most of two seasons voicing the robot [[Twiki (robot)|Twiki]] in ''[[Buck Rogers in the 25th Century (TV series)|Buck Rogers in the 25th Century]],'' Blanc's last original character was [[Heathcliff (comic strip)|Heathcliff]], in the early 1980s.  Blanc continued to voice his famous characters in commercials and TV specials for most of the decade, although he increasingly left the "yelling" characters like [[Yosemite Sam]], [[Foghorn Leghorn]] and [[Tasmanian Devil (Looney Tunes)|Taz]] to other voice actors since as he got older, he found their voices too hard on his throat. His final performance of his Looney Tunes roles was in ''[[Daffy Duck's Quackbusters]]''.

In the 1983 live-action film ''[[Strange Brew]]'', Blanc voiced the father of [[Bob and Doug MacKenzie]], at the request of comedian [[Rick Moranis]].

In the 1988 live-action/animated movie ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]],'' Blanc reprised several of his classic Looney Tunes roles (Bugs, Daffy, Porky, Tweety and [[Sylvester (Looney Tunes)|Sylvester]]), but left Yosemite Sam to [[Joe Alaskey]] (who later became one of Blanc's permanent successors).  As [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] released the film (under its [[Touchstone Pictures]] banner), it had to earn the blessing of Warner Bros. (and other rival studios) in order to feature the various non-Disney characters in the movie. Blanc died just a year after the film's release. His final recording session was for ''[[Jetsons: The Movie]]'' (1990).<ref>[[Jerry Beck|Beck, Jerry]]. ''The Animated Movie Guide'' (2005).</ref>

==Death==
[[File:Mel Blanc 4-15-05.JPG|thumb|Blanc's gravesite marker]]
<!-- Please seek consensus at the Talk page before editing the Death section and adding reasons other than emphysema and heart disease -->
Blanc began [[smoking cigarettes]] when he was 9 years old. He continued his pack-a-day habit until he was diagnosed with [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|emphysema]], which pushed him to quit at age 77.<ref>{{cite news|title=Mel Blanc: His Voice Is His Fortune|first=Aljean|last=Harmetz|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1988-11-27/features/8803090392_1_noel-blanc-mel-blanc-bugs-bunny|date=November 27, 1988|work=[[Sun-Sentinel]]|publisher=[[Tribune Company]]|accessdate=2013-07-19}}</ref> On May 19, 1989, Blanc was checked into [[Cedars-Sinai Medical Center]] by his family <ref>{{cite web|url=http://onefoggy.tripod.com/blancobit.html|title= Mel Blanc - Obituary|publisher=|accessdate=25 November 2014}}</ref> when they noticed he had a bad cough while shooting a commercial; he was originally expected to recover. Blanc's health then took a turn for the worse and doctors found that he had advanced [[coronary artery disease]]. He died on July 10 at [[Cedars-Sinai Medical Center]] in Los Angeles, [[California]] at the age of 81.<ref>{{cite news |title=Mel Blanc, Who Provided Voices For 3,000 Cartoons, Is Dead at 81 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/11/obituaries/mel-blanc-who-provided-voices-for-3000-cartoons-is-dead-at-81.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=July 11, 1989 |accessdate=2008-06-26 |quote=Mel Blanc, the versatile, multi-voiced actor who breathed life into such cartoon characters as Bugs Bunny, Woody Woodpecker, Daffy Duck, Porky Pig, Tweety Pie, Sylvester and the Road Runner, died of heart disease and emphysema yesterday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles.

==Legacy==
Blanc is regarded as the most prolific voice actor in the history of the industry.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=yImkNboc4tsC&pg=PA217 |page=217 |title=Raised by the Stars: Interviews with 29 Children of Hollywood Actors |last=Thomas |first=Nick |publisher=McFarland |year=2011 |isbn=0786464038}}</ref> He was the first voice actor to receive on-screen credit.<ref name="Blanc"/>

Blanc's death was considered a significant loss to the cartoon industry because of his skill, expressive range, and sheer volume of continuing characters he portrayed, which are currently taken up by several other voice talents. Indeed, as movie critic [[Leonard Maltin]] once pointed out, "It is astounding to realize that Tweety Bird and Yosemite Sam are the same man!"

According to Blanc, Sylvester the Cat was the easiest character to voice because "It's just my normal speaking voice with a spray at the end." Yosemite Sam was the hardest because of his loudness and raspiness.<ref name="Blanc"/>

A doctor who once examined Blanc's throat found that he possessed unusually thick, powerful vocal cords that gave him an exceptional range. The doctor reported that they rivaled those of famed opera singer [[Enrico Caruso]].<ref name="Blanc"/>

After his death, Blanc's voice continued to be heard in newly released productions, such as recordings of Dino the Dinosaur in the live-action films ''[[The Flintstones (film)|The Flintstones]]'' (1994) and ''[[The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas]]'' (2000).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109813/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast|title=The Flintstones (1994)|work=IMDb|accessdate=20 October 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0158622/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast|title=The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas (2000)|work=IMDb|accessdate=20 October 2014}}</ref> Similarly, recordings of Blanc as Jack Benny's Maxwell were featured in ''[[Looney Tunes: Back in Action]]'' (2003).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0318155/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast|title=Looney Tunes: Back in Action (2003)|work=IMDb|accessdate=20 October 2014}}</ref> More recently, archive recordings of Blanc have been featured in new [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]]-animated ''Looney Tunes'' theatrical shorts; ''[[I Tawt I Taw a Puddy Tat]]'' (shown with ''[[Happy Feet Two]]'') and ''[[Daffy's Rhapsody]]'' (shown with ''[[Journey 2: The Mysterious Island]]'').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=78492 |title=More 3D Looney Tunes Shorts On The Way |publisher=ComingSoon.net |date= |accessdate=October 29, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Vary |first=Adam B. |url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2011/11/14/tweety-bird-sylvester-looney-tunes-clip-exclusive/#more-53075 |title=Looney Tunes short with Tweety Bird, Sylvester - EXCLUSIVE CLIP &#124; Inside Movies &#124; EW.com |publisher=Insidemovies.ew.com |date= |accessdate=October 29, 2012}}</ref>

Blanc trained his son Noel in the field of voice characterization. Although the younger Blanc has performed his father's characters (particularly Porky Pig) on some programs, he has chosen not to become a full-time voice artist.

For his contributions to the radio industry, Mel Blanc has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 6385 [[Hollywood Boulevard]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000305/bio|title=Mel Blanc|work=IMDb|accessdate=20 October 2014}}</ref> His character Bugs Bunny also has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame (the only others to have received this honor are [[Walt Disney]] as both himself and [[Mickey Mouse]]; [[Jim Henson]] as both himself and [[Kermit the Frog]]; and [[Mike Myers]] as both himself and [[Shrek (character)|Shrek]]).<ref>{{cite web|title=Bugs Bunny|url=http://www.walkoffame.com/bugs-bunny|publisher=Hollywood Chamber of Commerce|accessdate=28 June 2012}}</ref>
