The '''Convention on Psychotropic Substances''' is a [[United Nations]] [[treaty]] designed to control [[psychoactive drug]]s such as [[amphetamine]]s, [[barbiturate]]s, and [[psychedelics]]. During the 1960s, drug use increased greatly around the world, especially in Western nations. Inspired by psychedelic advocates such as [[Aldous Huxley]] and [[Timothy Leary]], millions of people experimented with powerful [[Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants|hallucinogens]], and [[Recreational drug use|drugs]] of all kinds became freely available. Government authorities saw this as immoral and destructive to economic progress. The [[Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs]] of 1961 could not ban the many newly discovered psychotropics, since its scope was limited to drugs with [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]]-, [[coca]]-, and [[opium]]-like effects.

On February 21, 1971, a conference of [[plenipotentiary|plenipotentiaries]] in [[Vienna]] signed a new Convention worded to include almost any conceivable mind-altering substance. The Convention, which contains import and export restrictions and other rules aimed at limiting drug use to scientific and medical purposes, came into force on August 16, 1976. Today, 175 nations are Parties to the treaty. Many laws have been passed to implement the Convention, including the U.S. [[Psychotropic Substances Act (United States)|Psychotropic Substances Act]], the UK [[Misuse of Drugs Act 1971]], and the Canadian [[Controlled Drugs and Substances Act]]. Like the treaty itself, these statutes usually divide drugs into several classes or Schedules.

Provisions to end the international trafficking of drugs covered by this Convention are contained in the [[United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances]]. This treaty, signed in 1988, regulates [[wiktionary:Precursor|precursor]] chemicals to drugs controlled by the Single Convention and the Convention on Psychotropic Substances. It also strengthens provisions against [[money laundering]] and other [[drug-related crime]]s.

[[Adolf Lande]], under the direction of the [[United Nations Office of Legal Affairs]], prepared the Commentary on the Convention on Psychotropic Substances. The Commentary, published in 1976, is an invaluable aid to interpreting the treaty and constitutes a key part of its [[legislative history]].

==History==
International drug control began with the 1912 [[International Opium Convention]], a treaty which adopted import and export restrictions on the [[poppy]]'s psychoactive derivatives. Over the next half-century, several additional treaties were adopted under [[League of Nations]] auspices, gradually expanding the list of controlled substances to encompass [[cocaine]] and other drugs and granting the [[Permanent Central Opium Board]] power to monitor compliance. After the [[United Nations]] was formed in 1945, those enforcement functions passed to the UN.

In 1961, a conference of plenipotentiaries in [[New York]] adopted the [[Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs]], which consolidated the existing drug control treaties into one document and added [[cannabis]] to the list of prohibited plants. In order to appease the pharmaceutical interests, the Single Convention's scope was sharply limited to the list of drugs enumerated in the Schedules annexed to the treaty and to those drugs determined to have similar effects.

During the 1960s, a wave of drug use spread across Western developed nations, to the point where it appeared to alarmed policymakers to be reaching epidemic proportions. Inspired by [[Aldous Huxley]], [[Timothy Leary]], and a host of other psychedelic avatars, young people began using hallucinogenic, stimulant, and other drugs on a widespread scale. In many jurisdictions, police had no laws under which to prosecute users and traffickers of these new drugs; [[LSD]], for instance, was not prohibited federally in the U.S. until 1967.

In 1968, "[d]eeply concerned at reports of serious damage to health being caused by [[LSD]] and similar hallucinogenic substances," the [[UN Economic and Social Council]] passed a resolution calling on nations to limit the use of such drugs to scientific and medical purposes and to impose import and export restrictions.<ref>{{cite web | date=1968-05-23 | url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/resolution_1968-05-23_6.html | title=1968/1294(XLIV). Urgent control measures for LSD and similar hallucinogenic substances | publisher=United Nations Economic and Social Council | accessdate=2006-04-15}}</ref> Later that year, the [[UN General Assembly]] requested that ECOSOC call upon the [[Commission on Narcotic Drugs]] to "give urgent attention to the problem of the abuse of the psychotropic substances not yet under international control, including the possibility of placing such substances under international control".<ref>{{cite web | date=1968-12-19 | url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/resolution_1968-12-19_1.html | title=2433(XXIII). International control of psychotropic substances | publisher=United Nations General Assembly | accessdate=2006-04-15}}</ref>

Circa 1969, with use of [[stimulant]]s growing, ECOSOC noted with considerable consternation that the Commission "was unable to reach agreement on the applicability of the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, 1961 to these substances".<ref>{{cite web | date=1969-06-05 | url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/resolution_1969-06-05_4.html | title=1969/1401(XLVI). The application of urgent control measures to certain stimulant drugs | publisher=United Nations Economic and Social Council | accessdate=2006-04-15}}</ref> The language of the Single Convention and its legislative history precluded any interpretation that would allow international regulation of these drugs under that treaty. A new convention, with a broader scope, would be required in order to bring those substances under control. Using the Single Convention as a template, the Commission prepared a draft convention which was forwarded to all UN member states. The [[UN Secretary-General]] scheduled a conference for early 1971 to finalize the treaty.<ref>{{cite web | date=1971-05-20 | url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/resolution_1971-05-20_1.html | title=1971/1576(L). United Nations Conference for the Adoption of a Protocol on Psychotropic Substances | publisher=United Nations Economic and Social Council | accessdate=2006-04-15}}</ref>

Meanwhile, countries had already begun passing legislation to implement the draft treaty. In 1969, Canada added Part IV to its [[Food and Drugs Act]], placing a set of "restricted substances," including [[LSD]], [[Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]], and [[3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine|MDA]], under federal control. In 1970, the United States completely revamped its existing drug control laws by enacting the [[Controlled Substances Act]] (amended in 1978 by the [[Psychotropic Substances Act (United States)|Psychotropic Substances Act]], which allows the U.S. drug control Schedules to be updated as needed to comply with the Convention). In 1971, the United Kingdom passed the [[Misuse of Drugs Act 1971]]. A host of other nations followed suit. A common feature shared by most implementing legislation is the establishment of several classes or Schedules of controlled substances, similarly to the Single Convention and the Convention on Psychotropic Substances, so that compliance with international law can be assured simply by placing a drug into the appropriate Schedule.

The conference convened on January 11, 1971. Nations split into two rival factions, based on their interests. According to a [[Canadian Senate]] report, "One group included mostly developed nations with powerful pharmaceutical industries and active psychotropics markets . . . The other group consisted of developing states...with few psychotropic manufacturing facilities".<ref name="CansenReport">{{cite web | year=2002 | url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/37/1/parlbus/commbus/senate/com-e/ille-e/rep-e/repfinalvol3-e.htm | title=CANNABIS: OUR POSITION FOR A CANADIAN PUBLIC POLICY | publisher=Parliament of Canada | accessdate=2006-04-15}}</ref> The organic drugmaking states that had suffered economically from the Single Convention's restrictions on [[cannabis]], [[coca]], and [[opium]], fought for tough regulations on synthetic drugs. The synthetic drug-producing states opposed those restrictions. Ultimately, the developing states' lobbying power was no match for the powerful pharmaceutical industry's, and the international regulations that emerged at the conference's close on February 21 were considerably weaker than those of the Single Convention.

The Convention's adoption marked a major milestone in the development of the global drug control regime. Over 59 years, the system had evolved from a set of loose controls focused on a single drug into a comprehensive regulatory framework capable of encompassing almost any mind-altering substance imaginable. According to Rufus King, "It covers such a grab-bag of natural and manufactured items that at every stage of its consideration its proponents felt obliged to stress anew that it would not affect alcohol or tobacco abuse."<ref>King, Rufus. [http://www.druglibrary.net/special/king/dhu/dhu21.htm The Drug Hang Up, America's Fifty-Year Folly].</ref>

==Schedules of Controlled Substances==
:''The list of Schedules and the substances presently therein can be found on the International Narcotics Control Board's website.''<ref>{{cite web | year=2003 | url=http://www.incb.org/pdf/e/list/green.pdf | format=PDF | title=List of psychotropic substances under international control | publisher=International Narcotics Control Board | accessdate=2006-04-15}}</ref>

The Convention has four Schedules of controlled substances, ranging from Schedule I (most restrictive) to Schedule IV (least restrictive). A list of psychotropic substances, and their corresponding Schedules, was annexed to the 1971 treaty. A 2002 European Parliament report describes the Schedules as follows:<ref name="EuroParlReport">{{cite web | author=Kathalijne Maria Buitenweg | date=2003-10-06 | url=http://www.chanvre-info.ch/info/en/Working-document-on-the-UN.html | title=Working document on the UN conventions on drugs | accessdate=2006-04-15}}</ref>
*'''Schedule I''' includes drugs claimed to create a serious risk to public health, whose therapeutic value is not currently acknowledged. It includes synthetic [[Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants|hallucinogens]] such as [[LSD]] in addition to natural hallucinogens like [[Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]]. [[MDMA]] or [[Ecstasy]] also falls under this category as does [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]].
*'''Schedule II''' includes stimulants of the [[amphetamine]] type, of limited therapeutic value, as well as some [[analgesic]]s such as [[morphine]]. 
*'''Schedule III''' includes [[barbiturate]] products with fast or average effects, which have been the object of serious abuse even though useful therapeutically, three benzodiazepines ([[temazepam]], [[flunitrazepam]], [[nimetazepam]]) and some analgesics like [[buprenorphine]].
*'''Schedule IV''' includes [[hypnotic]] and [[anxiolytic]] [[benzodiazepines]] (except temazepam, flunitrazepam, and nimetazepam), and mild analgesics, which engender an appreciable dependence, but are mainly used in therapy.

A 1999 UNODC report notes that Schedule I is a completely different regime from the other three. According to that report, Schedule I mostly contains [[Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants|hallucinogenic drugs]] such as [[LSD]] that are produced by illicit laboratories, while the other three Schedules are mainly for licitly produced pharmaceuticals. The UNODC report<ref>{{cite web | last=Bayer | first=I. | coauthors=H. Ghodse | url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/bulletin/bulletin_1999-01-01_1_page003.html | title=Evolution of international drug control, 1945-1995 | year=1999 | accessdate=2006-04-15}}</ref> also claims that the Convention's Schedule I controls are stricter than those provided for under the Single Convention, a contention that seems to be contradicted by the 2002 [[Canadian Senate]]<ref name="CansenReport"/> and 2003 [[European Parliament]] reports.<ref>{{cite web | author=Kathalijne Maria Buitenweg | date=2003-03-24 | url=http://www.europarl.eu.int/omk/sipade3?PUBREF=-//EP//NONSGML+REPORT+A5-2003-0085+0+DOC+PDF+V0//EN&L=EN&LEVEL=3&NAV=S&LSTDOC=Y | format=PDF | title=Report Including a Proposal for a Recommendation of the European Parliament to the Council on the Reform of the Conventions on Drugs | publisher=Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, European Parliament | accessdate=2006-04-15}}</ref>

Although estimates and other controls specified by the Single Convention are not present in the Convention on Psychotropic Substances, the [[International Narcotics Control Board]] corrected the omission by asking Parties to submit information and statistics not required by the Convention, and using the initial positive responses from various organic drug producing states to convince others to follow.<ref>{{cite web | date=2005-01-01 | url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/treaty_adherence.html | title=Monthly Status of Treaty Adherence | publisher=United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime | accessdate=2006-04-15}}</ref> In addition, the Convention does impose tighter restrictions on imports and exports of Schedule I substances. A 1970 [[Bulletin on Narcotics]] report notes:<ref name="Unodc.org-Report2">{{cite web | date=1970-01-01 | url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/bulletin/bulletin_1970-01-01_3_page002.html | title=The Protocol on Psychotropic Substances | publisher=United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime | accessdate=2006-04-15}}</ref>
:''LSD, mescaline, etc., are controlled in a way which is more stringent than morphine under the narcotics treaties. [[Wikisource:Convention on Psychotropic Substances#Article 7: SPECIAL PROVISIONS REGARDING SUBSTANCES IN SCHEDULE 1|Article 7]], which sets down this regime, provides that such substances can only be moved in international trade when both exporter and importer are government authorities, or government agencies or institutions specially authorized for the purpose; in addition to this very rigid identification of supplier and recipient, in each case export and import authorization is also mandatory.''<!--Their quote said Article 6, but it's really Article 7.-->

==Scheduling process==
[[Wikisource:Convention on Psychotropic Substances#Article 2: SCOPE OF CONTROL OF SUBSTANCES|Article 2]] sets out a process for adding additional drugs to the Schedules. First, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) must find that the drug meets the specific criteria set forth in Article 2, Section 4, and thus is eligible for control. Then, the WHO issues an assessment of the substance that includes:
*The extent or likelihood of abuse,
*The degree of gravity in the public health and social problem, and
*The degree of utility of the substance in legitimate medical therapy.
The [[Commission on Narcotic Drugs]] makes the final decision on whether to add the drug to a Schedule, "taking into account the communication from the World Health Organization, whose assessments shall be determinative as to medical and scientific matters, and bearing in mind the economic, social, legal, administrative and other factors it may consider relevant". A similar process is followed in deleting a drug from the Schedules or transferring a drug between Schedules. For instance, at its 33rd meeting, the WHO Expert Committee on Drug Dependence recommended transferring [[tetrahydrocannabinol]] to Schedule IV of the Convention, citing its medical uses and low abuse potential.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.who.int/medicines/library/qsm/who-edm-qsm-2000-5/thc.doc | title=Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol and its stereochemical variants (Available from archive.org) | publisher=World Health Organization | accessdate=2006-04-15}}</ref>

The [[UN Economic and Social Council]] is the only body with the power to alter or reverse the Commission's scheduling decisions.

In the event of a disagreement about a drug's Scheduling, Article 2, Paragraph 7 allows a Party to, within 180 days of the communication of the Commission's decision, give the [[UN Secretary-General]] "a written notice that, in view of exceptional circumstances, it is not in a position to give effect with respect to that substance to all of the provisions of the Convention applicable to substances in that Schedule." This allows the nation to comply with a less stringent set of restrictions. The U.S. [[Controlled Substances Act]]'s ''21 U.S.C. <U+00A7> 811(d)(4)'' implies that placing a drug in Schedule IV or V of the Act is sufficient to "carry out the minimum United States obligations under paragraph 7 of article 2 of the Convention".<ref>{{cite web | date=2002-01-22 | url=http://www.usdoj.gov/dea/pubs/csa/811.htm | title=21 U.S.C. <U+00A7> 811(d)(4) | accessdate=2006-04-15}}</ref> This provision, which calls for temporarily placing a drug under federal drug control in the event the Convention requires it, was invoked in 1984 with [[rohypnol]]. Long before abuse of the drug was sufficiently widespread in the United States to meet the Act's drug control criteria, rohypnol was added to the Schedules of the Convention on Psychotropic Substances, and the U.S. government had to place rohypnol in Schedule IV of the Controlled Substances Act in order to meet its minimum treaty obligations.<ref>{{cite web | date=1999-03-11 | url=http://www.hhs.gov/asl/testify/t990311b.html | title=Statement on "Date Rape" Drugs by Nicholas Reuter, M.P.H. | publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services | accessdate=2006-04-15}}</ref>

As of March 2005, 111 substances were controlled under the Convention.<!--A number of derivatives (salts, esters, etc.) are also controlled informally.-->

==World Health Organization evaluations of specific drugs==
===Ephedrine===
In 1998, [[ephedrine]] was recommended for control under the Convention. The [[Dietary Supplement Safety and Science Coalition]] lobbied against control, stressing the drug's history and safety, and arguing that "ephedrine is not a controlled substance in the US today, nor should it be internationally".<ref>[http://ddmi.he.net/~herbs/current/ephcontrol.html DSSC says ephedrine should not be a controlled substance], Herb World News Online, 1998.</ref> After a two-year debate, the Expert Committee on Drug Dependence decided against regulating ephedrine. However, the Commission on Narcotics Drugs and the International Narcotics Control Board listed the drug as a Table I precursor under the [[United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances]], a move that did not require WHO approval.

[[Image:Ketamine2.JPG|thumb|right|Despite its well-known presence in the rave scene, [[ketamine]], or Special K, remains uncontrolled internationally due to its importance as an [[anesthetic]] in veterinary medicine.]]

===Ketamine===
The Expert Committee on Drug Dependence cautiously began investigating [[ketamine]] at its thirty-third meeting, noting, "Its use in veterinary medicine must also be considered in relation to its control".<ref>{{cite web | date=2003-03-17 | url=http://www.unicri.it/min.san.bollettino/altre/915-en.pdf | format=PDF | title=WHO Expert Committee on Drug Dependence | publisher=World Health Organization | accessdate=2006-04-15}}</ref> Ketamine remains uncontrolled internationally, although many nations have enacted restrictions on the drug.

===MDMA===
The Expert Committee's evaluation of MDMA, or [[Ecstasy (drug)|Ecstasy]], during its twenty-second meeting was marked by pleas from doctors to allow further research into the drug's therapeutic uses. The UN was under considerable pressure from the United States government to control the drug in the wake of extensive seizures of the drug by American authorities. [[Paul Grof]], chairman of the Expert Committee, argued that international control was not yet warranted, and that scheduling should be delayed pending completion of more studies. The Expert Committee concluded that because there was "insufficient evidence to indicate that the substance has therapeutic usefulness," it should be placed in Schedule I. However, its report did recommend more MDMA research:<ref>{{cite book | first=Nicholas | last=Saunders | year=1993 | title=E for Ecstasy | id=ISBN 0-9501628-8-4 | url=http://www.erowid.org/library/books_online/e_for_ecstasy/e_for_ecstasy-a1-1.shtml#R15}}</ref>
:''It should be noted that the Expert Committee held extensive discussions concerning therapeutic usefulness of 3,4 Methylenedioxymethamphetamine. While the Expert Committee found the reports intriguing, it felt that the studies lacked the appropriate methodological design necessary to ascertain the reliability of the observations. There was, however, sufficient interest expressed to recommend that investigations be encouraged to follow up these preliminary findings. To that end, the Expert Committee urged countries to use the provisions of [[Wikisource:Convention on Psychotropic Substances#Article 7: SPECIAL PROVISIONS REGARDING SUBSTANCES IN SCHEDULE 1|Article 7]] of the Convention on Psychotropic Substances to facilitate research on this interesting substance.''

===Methcathinone===
Circa 1994, the United States government notified the [[UN Secretary General]] that it supported controlling [[methcathinone]], an addictive stimulant manufactured with common household products, as a Schedule I drug under the Convention. The FDA report warned of the drug's dangers, even noting that addicts in Russia were observed to often have "[[potassium permanganate]] burns on their fingers" and to "tend not to pay attention to their appearance, thus looking ragged with dirty hands and hair".<ref>{{cite web | date=1994-06-20 | url=http://paranoia.lycaeum.org/stimulants/59.FR.31639 | title=International Drug Scheduling; Convention on Psychotropic Substances; Certain Stimulant/Hallucinogenic Drugs and Certain Nonbarbiturate Sedative Drugs | publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration | accessdate=2006-04-15}}</ref> With methcathinone having no medical use, the decision to place the drug in Schedule I was uncontested.

===Nicotine===
Traditionally, the UN has been reluctant to control [[nicotine]] and other drugs traditionally legal in Europe and North America, citing tolerance of a wide range of lifestyles.  This contrasts with the regulatory regime for other highly addictive drugs.  [[Gabriel Nahas]], in a [[Bulletin on Narcotics]] report, noted:<ref>{{cite web | author=G. G. Nahas | date=1981-01-01 | url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/bulletin/bulletin_1981-01-01_2_page002.html | title=A pharmacological classification of drugs of abuse | publisher=United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime | accessdate=2006-04-15}}</ref>
:''Some addictive drugs such as nicotine or caffeine (in moderate amounts) and alcohol (in small amounts) do not produce any measurable symptoms of neuropsychological toxicity. Some pharmacologists have associated the symptoms of neuropsychological toxicity with behavioural toxicity, which include in addition: suppression of normal anxiety, reduction in motivation and non-purposive or inappropriate behaviour. However, the latter behavioural symptoms do not present "markers" which may be measurable in societies accepting as "normal" a wide range of life styles.''
Nonetheless, in October 1996, the Expert Committee considered controlling nicotine, especially products such as gum, patches, nasal spray, and inhalers.<ref>{{cite web | year=1997 | url=http://www.nida.nih.gov/DirReports/DirRep297/DirectorReport9.html | title=Director's Report to the National Advisory Council on Drug Abuse | publisher=U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse | accessdate=2006-04-15}}</ref> The UN ultimately left nicotine unregulated. Since then, nicotine products have become even more loosely controlled; Nicorette gum, for instance, is now an [[over-the-counter drug]] in the United States.

===Tetrahydrocannabinol===
[[Tetrahydrocannabinol]] (THC), the main active ingredient in [[cannabis]], was originally placed in Schedule I when the Convention was enacted in 1971. At its twenty-sixth meeting, the WHO Expert Committee on Drug Dependence recommended that THC be transferred to Schedule II, citing its low abuse potential. The Commission on Narcotic Drugs rejected the proposal. At its thirty-third meeting, the Committee issued another evaluation of the drug, stating:
:''The abuse liability of dronabinol (delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol) is expected to remain very low so long as cannabis continues to be readily available. The Committee considered that the abuse liability of dronabinol does not constitute a substantial risk to public health and society. In accordance with the established scheduling criteria, the Committee considered that dronabinol should be rescheduled to schedule IV of the 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances.''
At its 45th meeting, on April 29, 1991, the Commission on Narcotic Drugs approved the transfer of dronabinol and its stereochemical variants from Schedule I to Schedule II of the Convention, while leaving other tetrahydrocannabinols and their stereochemical variants in Schedule I.

==Medical and other drug uses==

[[Image:Peyote_Cactus.jpg|thumb|right|Article 32 makes an exception for [[peyote]] and other "plants growing wild which contain psychotropic substances from among those in Schedule I and which are traditionally used by certain small, clearly determined groups in magical or religious rites".]]Like the Single Convention, the Convention on Psychotropic Substances recognizes scientific and medical use of psychoactive drugs, while banning other uses. [[Wikisource:Convention on Psychotropic Substances#Article 7: SPECIAL PROVISIONS REGARDING SUBSTANCES IN SCHEDULE 1|Article 7]] provides that, in respect of Schedule I substances, the Parties shall "[p]rohibit all use except for scientific and very limited medical purposes by duly authorized persons, in medical or scientific establishments which are directly under the control of their Governments or specifically approved by them".

In this sense, the U.S. [[Controlled Substances Act]] is stricter than the Convention requires. Both have a tightly restricted category of drugs called Schedule I, but the Act prohibits medical use of Schedule I substances, while the Convention allows limited medical use of all substances.

[[Wikisource:Convention on Psychotropic Substances#Article 32: RESERVATIONS|Article 32]] allows an exemption for [[peyote]] and other "plants growing wild which contain psychotropic substances from among those in Schedule I and which are traditionally used by certain small, clearly determined groups in magical or religious rites". However, this provision can only be invoked if a Party makes a reservation at the time of signature, ratification or accession. The U.S. Government, in ''[[Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita Beneficente Uniao do Vegetal]]'', argued that this is an extremely limited exemption. That case involved a seizure by [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]] of several drums of [[Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]]-containing liquid derived from [[ayahuasca]]. Plaintiffs sued to have the drugs returned to them, claiming that they used it as a central part of their religion.<ref>{{cite web | year=2001 | url=http://www.state.gov/s/l/16353.htm | title=Memorandum in Opposition to Plaintiffs<U+2019> Motion for Summary Judgment in O Centro Espirita Beneficiente Uniao do Vegetal v. Reno, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Mexico, January 25, 2001. | publisher=U.S. State Department | accessdate=2006-04-15}}</ref>

==Organic plants==
The Commentary on the Convention on Psychotropic Substances notes that while many plant-derived chemicals are controlled by the treaty, the plants themselves are not:<ref>Lande, Adolf, et al: [http://www.maps.org/pipermail/maps_forum/2001-March/003376.html Commentary on the Convention on Psychotropic Substances, New York 1976, E/CN.7/589, p.385]</ref>
[[Image:Shrooms.jpeg|frame|right|Psilocybin mushrooms are not controlled by the Convention, but the drugs contained in them are.]]
:''The term "synthetic" appears to refer to a psychotropic substance manufactured by a process of full chemical synthesis. One may also assume that the authors of the Vienna Convention intended to apply the term "natural material" to parts of a plant which constitute a psychotropic substance, and the term "natural psychotropic substance" to a substance obtained directly from a plant by some process of manufacturing which was relatively simple, and in any event much simpler than a process of full chemical synthesis.''
:''(...)''
:''Cultivation of plants for the purpose of obtaining psychotropic substances or raw materials for the manufacture of such substances is not "manufacture" in the sense of [[Wikisource:Convention on Psychotropic Substances#Article 1: USE OF TERMS|Article 1]], paragraph (i). Many provisions of the Vienna Convention governing psychotropic substances would be unsuitable for application to cultivation. The harvesting of psychotropic substances, i.e. separation of such substances from the plants from which they are obtained, is "manufacture".''
:''(...)''
:''The cultivation of plants from which psychotropic substances are obtained is not controlled by the Vienna Convention. (...) Neither the crown (fruit, mescal button) of the [[Peyote]] cactus nor the roots of the plant Mimosa hostilis nor Psilocybe mushrooms themselves are included in Schedule 1, but only their respective principles, [[Mescaline]], [[Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]] and [[Psilocybin]].''
[[Mexico]], in particular, argued that "production" of psychotropic drugs should not apply to wild-growing plants such as [[peyote]] cacti or [[psilocybin]] mushrooms. The [[Bulletin on Narcotics]] noted that "Mexico could not undertake to eradicate or destroy these plants".<ref name="Unodc.org-Report2"/> Compared to the [[Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs]] (which calls for "uprooting of all coca bushes which grow wild" and governmental licensing, purchasing, and wholesaling of licit opium, coca, and cannabis crops), the Convention on Psychotropic Substances devotes few words to the subject of psychoactive plants.

On July 2, 1987, the United States Assistant Secretary of Health recommended that the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] initiate scheduling action under the [[Controlled Substances Act]] in order to implement restrictions required by [[cathinone]]'s Schedule I status under the Convention. The 1993 DEA rule placing cathinone in the CSA's Schedule I noted that it was effectively also banning [[khat]]:<ref>{{cite web | date=1993-01-14 | url=http://www.erowid.org/freedom/law/federal_register/58.FR.4316.shtml | title=21 CFR Part 1308. Schedules of Controlled Substances: Placement of Cathinone and 2,5-Dimethoxy-4-ethylamphetamine Into Schedule I | publisher=U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration | accessdate=2006-04-15}}</ref>
:''Cathinone is the major psychoactive component of the plant Catha edulis (khat). The young leaves of khat are chewed for a stimulant effect. Enactment of this rule results in the placement of any material which contains cathinone into Schedule I.''

==Precursors==
A 1971 [[Bulletin on Narcotics]] notes:<ref>{{cite web | date=1971-01-01 | url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/treaties/psychotropics.html | title=The Convention on Psychotropic Substances | publisher=United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime | accessdate=2008-07-16}}</ref>
:''[[Wikisource:Convention on Psychotropic Substances#Article 2: SCOPE OF CONTROL OF SUBSTANCES|Article 2]], in paragraph 4 of the original text, carried over the concept in [[Wikisource:Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs#Article 3: CHANGES IN THE SCOPE OF CONTROL|Article 3]] (3) (iii) of the Single Convention, and required the application to a "precursor " <U+2013> i.e. a substance "readily convertible" into a substance under control <U+2013> of measures of control. In Vienna the complexity of controlling precursors of psychotropic substances was agreed to be so overwhelming that no absolute obligation to control them was provided. The new article 2 in paragraph 9 asks Parties "to use their best endeavours" to apply "such measures of supervision as may be practicable" to substances which may be used in the illicit manufacture of psychotropic substances, i.e. their precursors and possibly also substances essential in the chemistry of manufacture.''
This provision was eventually judged to be inadequate, and was strengthened by the [[United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances]]'s precursor control regime, which established two Tables of controlled precursors. The [[Commission on Narcotic Drugs]] and [[International Narcotics Control Board]] were put in charge of adding, removing, and transferring substances between the Tables.

==Analogs==
Circa 1999, the Government of Spain proposed amending Schedules I and II to include [[isomer]]s, [[ester]]s, [[ether]]s, salts of isomers, esters and ethers, and any "substance resulting from modification of the chemical structure of a substance already in Schedule I or II and which produced pharmacological effects similar to those produced by the original substances".<ref>{{cite web | date=1999-05-03 | url=http://www.un.org/documents/ecosoc/docs/1999/e1999-28.htm | title=Report on the forty-second session | publisher=United Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs | accessdate=2006-04-15}}</ref> The WHO opposed this change. The [[Commission on Narcotic Drugs]] did amend the Schedules to include [[stereoisomer]]s, however, with the understanding that "specific isomers that did not have hazardous pharmacological activity and that posed no danger to society could be excluded from control, as [[dextromethorphan]] had been in the case of Schedule I of the 1961 Convention."

==Penal provisions==
[[File:LSDLabGlassware.jpg|frame|right|LSD and equipment used in its manufacture are subject to seizure under Article 22.]]
[[Wikisource:Convention on Psychotropic Substances#Article 22: PENAL PROVISIONS|Article 22]] provides:
:''1. (a) Subject to its constitutional limitations, each Party shall treat as a punishable offence, when committed intentionally, any action contrary to a law or regulation adopted in pursuance of its obligations under this Convention, and shall ensure that serious offences shall be liable to adequate punishment, particularly by imprisonment or other penalty of deprivation of liberty.
:''1. (b) Notwithstanding the preceding sub-paragraph, when abusers of psychotropic substances have committed such offences, the Parties may provide, either as an alternative to conviction or punishment or in addition to punishment, that such abusers undergo measures of treatment, education, after-care, rehabilitation and social reintegration in conformity with paragraph 1 of article 20.

[[conspiracy (crime)|Conspiracy]], attempts, preparatory acts, and financial operations related to drug offenses are also called on to be criminalized. Parties are also asked to count convictions handed down by foreign governments in determining [[recidivism]]. Article 22 also notes that [[extradition]] treaties are "desirable", although a nation retains the right to refuse to grant extradition, including "where the competent authorities consider that the offence is not sufficiently serious."

As with all articles of the Convention on Psychotropic Substances, the provisions of Article 22 are only suggestions which do not override the domestic law of the member countries: 
:''4. The provisions of this article shall be subject to the provisions of the domestic law of the Party concerned on questions of jurisdiction.
:''5. Nothing contained in this article shall affect the principle that the offences to which it refers shall be defined, prosecuted and punished in conformity with the domestic law of a Party.

==Treatment and prevention==
[[Wikisource:Convention on Psychotropic Substances#Article 22: PENAL PROVISIONS|Article 22]] allows Parties, in implementing the Convention's penal provisions, to make exceptions for drug abusers by substituting "treatment, education, after-care, [[Drug rehabilitation|rehabilitation]] and social reintegration" for [[imprisonment]]. This reflects a shift in focus in the war on drugs from incarceration to treatment and prevention that had already begun to take hold by 1971. Indeed, in 1972, a parallel provision allowing treatment for drug abusers was added to the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs by the [[Protocol Amending the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs]].

[[Wikisource:Convention on Psychotropic Substances#Article 20: MEASURES AGAINST THE ABUSE OF PSYCHOTROPIC SUBSTANCES|Article 20]] mandates drug treatment, education, and prevention measures and requires Parties to assist efforts to "gain an understanding of the problems of abuse of psychotropic substances and of its prevention" and to "promote such understanding among the general public if there is a risk that abuse of such substances will become widespread." To comply with these provisions, most Parties financially support organizations and agencies dedicated to these goals. The United States, for instance, established the [[National Institute on Drug Abuse]] in 1974 to comply with the research requirement and began sponsoring [[Drug Abuse Resistance Education]] in 1983 to help fulfill the educational and prevention requirements.

==Recent trends==
===Rise in stimulant trafficking===
<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Methlab.jpg|thumb|The 1971 Convention was designed to control legitimate pharmaceutical markets, rather than illicit markets, a limitation that has hampered efforts to stem clandestine production and trade of [[methamphetamine]] and other stimulants.]] -->
Control of [[stimulant]]s has become a major challenge for the UN. In 1997, the [[World Drug Report]] warned:<ref>{{cite web | date=1997 | url=http://www.ias.org.uk/publications/theglobe/97issue3/globe9703_p11.html | title=World drug threat, the UN reports | publisher=United Nations International Drug Control Programme | accessdate=2006-04-15}}</ref>
:''Since the mid-1980s the world has faced a wave of synthetic stimulant abuse, with approximately nine times the quantity seized in 1993 than in 1978, equivalent to an average annual increase of 16 per cent. The principle synthetic drugs manufactured clandestinely are the amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS) which include the widely abused [[amphetamine]] and [[methamphetamine]], as well as the more recently popularised [[methylenedioxymethamphetamine]] (MDMA), known as ecstasy." It is estimated that throughout the world 30,000,000, people use ATS. This is 0.5 per cent of the global population and exceeds the number using [[heroin]] and probably those using [[cocaine]].''
A 1998 UN General Assembly Special Session on the World Drug Problem report noted:<ref>{{cite web | year=1998 | url=http://www.un.org/ga/20special/featur/amphet.htm | title=Amphetamine-Type Stimulants: Speeding Towards the Millennium | publisher=United Nations Department of Public Information | accessdate=2006-04-15}}</ref>
:''Between 1971 and 1995, there was a nearly fivefold increase in the number of amphetamine-type stimulants under international control. . . [[methylenedioxymethamphetamine|ecstasy]] and related designer drugs are under schedule one of the 1971 Convention, because they have virtually no medical use, while [[amphetamine]] and [[methamphetamine]] are under schedule 2 because they began life with medical use. But even though they are scheduled, the system is not really working for these illegally produced drugs. One of the main limitations of the control system is that the Psychotropic Convention was not designed to control illicit markets. It was designed to control and regulate legitimate pharmaceutical markets to prevent their [[diversion]] into illicit markets.'' 
The report mentioned proposals to increase the flexibility of scheduling drugs under the Convention and to amend the drug-control treaties to make them more responsive to the current situation. Neither proposal has gained traction, however. Due to the ease of manufacturing methamphetamine, methcathinone, and certain other stimulants, control measures are focusing less on preventing drugs from crossing borders. Instead, they are centering around increasingly long prison sentences for manufacturers and traffickers as well as regulations on large purchases of [[wiktionary:Precursor|precursor]]s such as [[ephedrine]] and [[pseudoephedrine]]. The International Narcotics Control Board and Commission on Narcotic Drugs help coordinate this fight by adding additional precursors to the Tables of chemicals controlled under the [[United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances]].

In 1997, ECOSOC called on nations to help enforce international law by cooperating "with relevant international organizations, such as the [[International Criminal Police Organization]] and the [[World Customs Organization]] . . . in order to promote coordinated international action in the fight against illicit demand for and supply of amphetamine-type stimulants and their precursors." That resolution also called on governments overseeing precursor exports "to inquire with the authorities of importing States about the legitimacy of transactions of concern, and to inform the International Narcotics Control Board of the action taken, particularly when they do not receive any reply to their inquiries".<ref>{{cite web | date=1997-07-21 | url=http://www.un.org/documents/ecosoc/res/1997/eres1997-41.htm | title=Implementation of comprehensive measures to counter the illicit manufacture, trafficking and abuse of amphetamine-type stimulants and their precursors | publisher=United Nations Economic and Social Council | accessdate=2006-04-15}}</ref>

[[Image:Methamphetamine.gif|frame|right|Crystal meth has emerged as a commonly abused drug, from the [[United States of America|American]] and European [[rave party|rave]] scenes to [[East Asia]].]]
Pockets of high-intensity clandestine production and trafficking, such as rural southwest [[Virginia]], exist in most industrialized nations. However, the [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]] believes that [[East Asia]] (particularly [[Thailand]]) now has the most serious amphetamine-type stimulant (ATS) problem in the world. A 2002 report by that agency noted:<ref>{{cite web | first=Wayne | last=Bazant | date=2002-02-04 | url=http://www.unodc.un.or.th/factsheet/ATSissuesplans310102.htm | title=Amphetamine Type Stimulants Threaten East Asia | publisher=United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime | accessdate=2006-04-15}}</ref>
:''For many countries the problem of ATS is relatively new, growing quickly and unlikely to go away. The geographical spread is widening. . . Abuse is increasingly concentrated among younger populations, who generally and erroneously believe that the substances are safe and benign. The abuse of ATS is threatening to become part of mainstream culture. The less optimistic suggest that ATS is already embedded in normative young adult behavior to such an extent that it will be very difficult to change, not withstanding the issues of physical, social and economic damage.
The Office called on nations to bring more resources to bear in the [[demand reduction]] effort, improving treatment and [[Drug rehabilitation|rehabilitation]] processes, increasing private sector participation in eliminating drugs from the workplace, and expanding the drug information clearing house to share information more effectively.

===Canadian noncompliance===
In 2000, the International Narcotics Control Board chastised Canada for refusing to comply with the Convention's requirement that international transactions in controlled psychotropics be reported to the Board. INCB Secretary Herbert Schaepe said:<ref>{{cite web | first=Steven | last=Edwards | date=2000-02-23 | url=http://www.marijuananews.com/news.php3?sid=126 | title=UN Blasts Canada for Hypocrisy on Drug Trade | publisher=The National Post | accessdate=2006-04-15}}</ref>
:''From Canada there is just a big, black hole. We don't know what is going into the country, nor coming out. We cannot monitor the international movement of these substances, which is our mandate. The lack of controls in Canada means that they could be destined for fake companies that will divert them into the hands of traffickers. Traffickers in third countries could be getting them through Canada. Normally, Canada has a very good reputation for fulfilling its international obligations, but here it is just breaking the treaty <U+2013> a treaty that it ratified a long time ago. It is very disturbing.''
To a Board already worried by European experiments with [[harm reduction]] and cannabis liberalization, the quiet Canadian defiance of treaty obligations seemed to be another hairline crack in the foundation of global drug control.

===Licit drug problems===
In an unusual departure from its normally pro-industry leanings, the INCB issued a press release in 2001 warning of excessive use of licit psychotropics:
:''. . . the Board points to loose regulation, unreliable estimates and information regarding medical needs, aggressive marketing techniques and improper or even unethical prescription practices as the main reasons for the oversupply of such controlled substances as [[benzodiazepine]]s and various amphetamine type stimulants. Easy availability leads to overconsumption of such substances, either in the form of drug abuse or by fuelling a culture of drug-taking to deal with a variety of non-medical problems. . . Insomnia, anxiety, obesity and child hyperactivity as well as various kinds of pain are listed among the most common problems to be treated by prescribing psychotropic substances. The Board is especially concerned that preference is given to quick solutions without looking at the long-term effects, as prolonged, excessive consumption of such drugs could result in dependency and other physical and mental suffering.''

The Board also warned that the [[Internet]] provides "easy access to information on drug production and drug-taking," calling it "a growing source of on-line [[drug trafficking]]." The Board pointed out that some Internet suppliers sell controlled drugs without regard to the Convention's [[medical prescription]] requirements.<ref>{{cite web | date=2001-02-15 | url=http://www.unhchr.ch/huricane/huricane.nsf/0/61158D4A9269068EC12569F5002BFAE4?opendocument | title=United Nations Press Release | publisher=United Nations Information Service | accessdate=2006-04-15}}</ref>
