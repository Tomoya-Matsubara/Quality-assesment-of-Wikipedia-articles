}} (primary source)</ref> Its lectures or '''TED Talks''', widely disseminated on the [[Internet]], are subject to an eighteen-minute time limit.

TED was founded in 1984 as a one-off event, and the conference was held annually from 1990. TED's early emphasis, consistent with a [[Silicon Valley]] center of gravity, was largely technology and design. Its co-founder was [[Richard Saul Wurman]], credited with having coined in 1976 the term [[information architect]]. As popularity of the talks has spread, so has the range of subject matter, to cover almost all aspects of science and culture. Those who have given TED talks include [[Bill Clinton]], [[Al Gore]], [[Gordon Brown]], [[Richard Dawkins]], [[Bill Gates]], the founders of [[Google]] and various [[Nobel Prize]] winners.<ref>TED: [http://www.ted.com/index.php/speakers Speakers] Retrieved on 6 February 2009 (primary source)</ref>

TED's [[curator]] is the British former computer journalist and magazine publisher [[Chris Anderson (TED)|Chris Anderson]]. It is owned by the [[Sapling Foundation]]. 

From 2005 to 2009, three $100,000 ''TED Prize''s were awarded annually to help its winners realize a chosen "wish to change the world." Starting in 2010, however, only one winner has been selected to ensure that TED can maximize its efforts of achieving the winner's wish. Each winner unveils their wish at the main annual conference{{ndash}}within the specified 18 minutes.

===TED Prize===
The TED Prize was introduced in 2005. In previous years, three individuals were each given $100,000 and granted a "wish to change the world", which they unveil at TED. However, starting in 2010, only one prize is awarded since "at least half of [the wishes] still require our engagement," and, "adding too many more risks dilution of effort."<ref>[http://blog.ted.com/2009/12/ted_prize_winne_4.php Blog.TED.com] (primary source)</ref>
