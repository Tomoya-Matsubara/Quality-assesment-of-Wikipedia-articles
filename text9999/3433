'''Tropical Storm Jerry''' was a [[tropical cyclone|tropical storm]] that caused severe flooding throughout the southeast [[United States]] in August of the [[1995 Atlantic hurricane season]]. Jerry, the tenth tropical storm of the season, formed from a tropical wave that moved off the [[Africa]]n coast in early August, which organized into a tropical depression and tropical storm between the [[Bahamas]] and [[Florida]] later in the month, before striking Florida in the end of August.  Its remnant circulation persisted until five days after landfall.  The rainfall it produced, amounting to over {{convert|12|in|mm}} in several locations across Florida, [[Georgia]], and [[South Carolina]], which was responsible for $40 million (2005 USD) in damage and 6 deaths. At the time, Jerry was the earliest tenth storm to form in a season on record, though Jose in the [[2005 Atlantic hurricane season|2005 season]] overtook it.<ref>[[National Hurricane Center]].

==Storm history==
{{storm path|Jerry 1995 track.png}}[[Image:Tropical Depression Jerry (1995).JPG|left|150px|thumb|Jerry as a Tropical Depression over Georgia]]

A [[tropical wave]] moved off the west coast of [[Africa]] on [[August 9]]. It moved westward across the [[Atlantic Ocean]], and reached the [[Lesser Antilles]] on [[August 15]]. While passing through the islands, [[convection]] greatly increased, causing wind gusts of up to {{convert|45|mph|km/h}}, though it remained disorganized. On [[August 22]], convection organized while the system was over the western [[Bahamas]], and it developed into Tropical Depression Eleven later that day. Conditions were only marginally favorable due to lack of [[outflow (meteorology)|outflow]] to its west, but the depression strengthened to reach tropical storm status on [[August 23]].<ref name="tcr">Richard Pasch.

Jerry, having reached tropical storm strength {{convert|33|mi|km}} east of the coast of [[Florida]], moved to the northwest and hit [[Jupiter, Florida|Jupiter]] later on [[August 23]]. It continued to the northwest across the state, and remained a storm until late on [[August 24]] when it entered the [[Gulf of Mexico]] over [[Citrus County, Florida|Citrus County]]. It remained over waters briefly until moving inland in [[Dixie County, Florida|Dixie County]] on [[August 25]]. It continued slowly northward, entering [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] on [[August 26]]. The weak depression turned to the east, and dissipated into a [[Trough (meteorology)|trough]] of low pressure on [[August 28]] near the Georgia/[[South Carolina]] border. The trough developed two circulation centers, one of which moved eastward while the other moved southward. The latter drifted southwestward across Florida until dissipating in early September. It is unknown if either of the circulations are directly related to the original center of Jerry.<ref name="tcr"/>

==Preparations==
Because much of the circulation was over land, Jerry was not predicted to intensify to a tropical storm. This caused [[Tropical cyclone warnings and watches|tropical storm warnings]] not to be issued until just hours before landfall.  While crossing over the state, the storm retained its strength, causing officials to issue Tropical Storm Warnings over the [[Florida Panhandle]]. However, Jerry remained a [[Tropical depression#Intensity classifications|tropical depression]] over the Gulf of Mexico, and the warnings were dropped after Jerry's second landfall.<ref name="tcr"/>

==Impact==

===Florida===
Upon making landfall in southeastern and western [[Florida]], Jerry caused a [[storm surge]] of {{convert|1|ft|m}} to {{convert|2|ft|m}} in most areas.<ref name="tcr"/>  Rainfall was generally moderate in the southeastern portion of the state, with the highest amounts of over {{convert|10|in|mm}} occurring in [[Palm Beach County, Florida|Palm Beach county]].<ref name="DR">[[David M. Roth]]. [http://www.hpc.ncep.noaa.gov/tropical/rain/jerry1995.html Tropical Storm Jerry Rainfall Page.] Retrieved on [[2008-03-06]].</ref>   A larger area of higher totals was recorded in southwestern Florida, with rainfall peaking at {{convert|16.8|in|mm}} in [[Golden Gate, Florida|Golden Gate]]. Winds were light, peaking at {{convert|43|mph|km/h}} at [[Patrick Air Force Base]] in [[Brevard County, Florida|Brevard County]]. The storm caused two weak [[tornado]]es and one [[waterspout]], though damage was minimal. In addition, Jerry caused light beach erosion.<ref name="tcr"/>

While wind damage was minimal, the heavy flooding left many roads across the state under water. In addition, it damaged 340 houses and destroyed 12, most of which were in [[Collier County, Florida|Collier County]].  In northwestern Florida, the flooding caused severe damage to the citrus crop, with total agricultural damage amounting to $15 million.  In all, damage in Florida amounted to $19&nbsp;million (1995 USD).<ref>{{Cite web|author=National Climatic Data Center|title=Florida Event report for Tropical Storm Jerry|year=1995|publisher=|accessdate=2008-03-18|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~194951}}</ref> The storm also caused two indirect deaths in the state, though no fatalities were directly attributed to Jerry.

===Georgia===
In [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], Jerry dropped severe rainfall of over {{convert|12|in|mm}} near [[Surrency, Georgia|Surrency]],<ref name="DRSE">[[David M. Roth]].
