The '''tench''' or '''doctor fish''' (''Tinca tinca'') is a [[freshwater]] and [[brackish water]] [[fish]] of the [[cyprinid]] (commonly called 'carp') family found throughout [[Eurasia]] from [[Western Europe]] including the [[British Isles]] east into [[Asia]] as far as the [[Ob River|Ob]] and [[Yenisei River]]s. It is also found in [[Lake Baikal]].<ref name=Fishbase>{{FishBase species|genus=Tinca|species=tinca|year=2007|month=5}}</ref> It normally inhabits slow-moving freshwater habitats, particularly lakes and lowland rivers.<ref name = "Rivers, Lakes and Marshes">B. Whitton (1982). ''Rivers, Lakes and Marshes'' p 163. Hodder & Staughton, London.</ref>

==Ecology==
The tench is most often found in still waters with a [[clay]] or [[mud]]dy [[Substrate (biology)|substrate]] and abundant vegetation.<ref name=Fishlore>A. F. Magri MacMahon (1946). ''Fishlore'', pp 156-158. Pelican Books.</ref> This species is rare in clear waters across stony ground, and is absent altogether from fast-flowing streams. It tolerates water with a low [[oxygen]] concentration,<ref name="Fishbase"/> being found in waters where even the [[carp]] cannot survive.<ref name="Fishlore"/>

Tench feed mostly at night with a preference for animals, like [[Chironomidae|chironomids]] on the bottom of [[eutrophic]] waters<ref name ="PERROW">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1095-8649.1996.tb01481.x/abstract</ref> and snails and [[Pisidium|pea clams]] in well vegetated waters<ref name="Fishlore"/><ref name = "BR<U+00D6>NMARK">http://www.jstor.org/pss/1939640</ref>

Breeding takes place in shallow water usually among aquatic plants where the sticky green eggs can be deposited.<ref name="Fishbase"/> Spawning usually occurs in summer,<ref name="Rivers, Lakes and Marshes"/> and as many as three hundred thousand eggs may be produced.<ref name=Observer>A. Lawrence Wells (date unknown). ''Observer Book of Freshwater Fishes'', pp 101-105. Frederick Warne & Co.</ref> Growth is rapid, and fish may reach a weight of 0.11 [[kilogram|kg]] (0.25 [[pound (mass)|lb]]) within the first year.

==Morphology==
 
Tench have a stocky, carp-like shape, olive-green skin, darker above and almost golden below. The caudal fin is square in shape. The other fins are distinctly rounded in shape.<ref name="Fishlore"/> The mouth is rather narrow and provided at each corner with a very small [[Barbel (anatomy)|barbel]]. Maximum size is 70&nbsp;cm, though most specimens are very much smaller.<ref name=Sterba>G. Sterba (1962). ''Freshwater Fishes of the World'' pp 249-250. Vista Books, London.</ref> The eyes are small and red-orange in colour.<ref name=Fishbase>Females can reach weights of around 7 kilos, although 4 kilos is considered large. Males rarely reach over 3 kilos.{{FishBase species|genus=Tinca|species=tinca|year=2007|month=5}}</ref> Sexual dimorphism is weak, limited to the adult females having a more convex ventral profile when compared with males.<ref name="Sterba"/> Males may also possess a very thick and flattened outer ray to the ventral fins.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} Males are generally smaller than females but can be recognised by having more curved lower fins and noticeable muscles around the base of the fins generally absent in female.

The tench has very small scales, which are deeply imbedded in a thick skin, making it as slippery as an [[eel]]. [[Folklore]] has it that this slime cured any sick fish that rubbed against it, and from this belief arose the name '''doctor fish'''.<ref name="Observer"/>

==Golden tench==
An artificially-bred variety of tench called the '''golden tench''' or '''schlei''' is a popular [[fishkeeping|ornamental fish]] for ponds. This form varies in colour from pale gold through to dark red, and some fish have black or red spots on the flanks and fins. Though somewhat similar to the [[goldfish]], because these fish have such small scales, the golden quality is rather different.<ref name="Observer"/>

==Economic significance==
Tench are edible, working well in recipes that would otherwise call for carp.<ref name="Fishlore"/> They are an important target for [[coarse angling|coarse]] [[Fisherman|angler]]s and are also used as [[fodder]] for predatory species such as [[Centrarchidae|bass]].<ref name="Fishbase"/> Tench, particularly golden tench, are also kept as ornamental fish in ponds and less frequently aquaria.<ref name=coldwater>Dick Mills (2000). ''Understanding Coldwater Fish'', p 106. Interpet Publishing. ISBN 1-903098-10-6</ref>

==Angling==
Large tench may be found in gravel pits or deep, slow-moving waters with a clayey or silty bottom and lots of aquatic vegetation. 
The best methods and bait to catch tench are float fishing and legering with a swim feeder using maggots, sweetcorn, pellets, bread, and worms as hook bait and groundbait in the swimfeeder if you are not float fishing. Due to the tench being a bottom feeder, it is essential that your bait is resting on the bottom of the lake/pond/canal bed when float fishing&mdash;use a plummet to make sure your bait is resting on the bottom by an inch or two. Fish over 1&nbsp;kg (2&nbsp;lb) in weight are very strong fighters when caught on a rod.<ref name=Observer>A. Lawrence Wells (date unknown). ''Observer Book of Freshwater Fishes'', pp 101-103.
