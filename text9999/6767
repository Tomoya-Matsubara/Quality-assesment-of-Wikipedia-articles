'''''Tales of Monkey Island''''' is a 2009 [[graphic adventure game|graphic adventure]] [[video game]] developed by [[Telltale Games]] and [[LucasArts]]. It is the fifth game in the ''[[Monkey Island (series)|Monkey Island]]'' series, released nearly a decade after the previous installment, ''[[Escape from Monkey Island]]''. Developed for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and the [[Wii]] console, the game was released in five [[episodic video game|episodic]] segments, between July and December 2009. In contrast to Telltale's previous episodic adventure games, whose chapters told discrete stories, each chapter of ''Tales of Monkey Island'' is part of an ongoing narrative. The game was [[Digital distribution|digitally distributed]] through [[WiiWare]] and Telltale's own website, and later through [[Steam (software)|Steam]] and [[Amazon.com]]. Ports for [[Mac OS X]], the [[PlayStation Network]] and the [[iPad]] were released several months after the series ended.

Players assume the role of [[Golden Age of Piracy|pirate]] [[Guybrush Threepwood]], who<U+2014>while attempting to destroy his nemesis, the undead pirate [[LeChuck]]<U+2014>accidentally releases a [[hoodoo (folk magic)|voodoo]] pox across the [[Gulf of Melange]]. With the assistance of his wife, [[Elaine Marley|Elaine {{nowrap|Marley<U+2013>Threepwood}}]], Guybrush seeks out a cure. The game was conceived in late 2008, due to renewed interest in adventure game development within LucasArts. It was developed concurrently with LucasArts' [[Video game remake|special edition]] of the 1990 title ''[[The Secret of Monkey Island]]''; LucasArts oversaw production of ''Tales of Monkey Island'', and ensured that it matched the remake in certain areas, such as art direction. Production began in early 2009; franchise creator [[Ron Gilbert]] was involved in project planning, while development was led by [[Dave Grossman (game developer)|Dave Grossman]], who co-designed the first two ''Monkey Island'' games. The game's music was composed by [[Michael Land]], and the core cast of ''[[The Curse of Monkey Island]]'' reprised their voice roles.

''Tales of Monkey Island'' received generally positive reviews. Critics praised the game's story, writing, humor, voice acting and characterization; [[1UP.com]] described Guybrush as Telltale's strongest and most expressive character yet. The game's music and graphics were also lauded. Complaints focused primarily on the perceived erratic quality of the game's puzzle design, a weak supporting cast in the early chapters, and the game's control system. ''Tales of Monkey Island'' garnered several industry awards, and is Telltale's most commercially successful project to date.

==Gameplay==
Like its predecessors, ''Tales of Monkey Island'' is a [[graphic adventure game]]; the player assumes the role of the protagonist in an [[interactive story]], which is driven by the exploration of the game's [[3D computer graphics|three-dimensional]] (3D) environments and by solving puzzles.<ref name="GameSpot Preview"/> These puzzles are traditional adventure game conundrums that require the player to use the environment, or items that have been found and stored inside the game's inventory, to accomplish goals.<ref name="GameSpot Preview"/> In keeping with previous ''[[Monkey Island (series)|Monkey Island]]'' games, ''Tales of Monkey Island'' allows players to combine certain items to create new items;<ref name="GameSpot Preview">{{cite web|url=http://e3.gamespot.com/story/6210602/tales-of-monkey-island-first-look|title=''Tales of Monkey Island'' First Look|publisher=GameSpot|date=2009-06-01|first=Sophia|last=Tong|accessdate=2009-06-01}}</ref><ref name="AdvGamers Preview"/> for instance, the player can combine a number of voodoo ingredients with a cutlass to produce a magical cutlass.<ref name="ep1 plot"/>

The game world is explored with a [[Personal computer|PC]] keyboard and mouse, or the [[Wii Nunchuk]]'s [[analog stick]].<ref name="GameSpot Preview"/> Contrary to previous Telltale adventure games, the player holds and drags the mouse to move Guybrush, rather than [[point-and-click|pointing and clicking]].<ref name="joystiq">{{cite web|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2009/07/07/review-tales-of-monkey-island-launch-of-the-screaming-narwhal/|title=Review: ''Tales of Monkey Island'' (Launch of the Screaming Narwhal) |last=Kietzmann |first=Ludwig |date=2009-07-07 |publisher=Joystiq |accessdate=2009-07-09}}</ref> The [[Arrow keys#WASD keys|WASD keys]] or the arrow keys may instead be used to move Guybrush. Like other ''Monkey Island'' games, ''Tales of Monkey Island'' is designed to prevent the player from meeting a dead-end, such as the death of the player character.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nintendo.co.uk/NOE/en_GB/games/wiiware/tales_of_monkey_island_history_14302.html|title=''Tales of Monkey Island'': History|publisher=Nintendo of Europe|accessdate=2009-12-18}}</ref> Each of the game's chapters is an estimated two to four hours in length, depending on the player's ability to solve the puzzles.<ref name="GameSpot Preview"/> A hint system can assist struggling players.<ref name="GameSpot Preview"/>

The first chapter of the game includes a "treasure hunt" mode,<ref>{{cite web|title=http://www.telltalegames.com/community/blogs/id-477 |url=http://www.telltalegames.com/community/blogs/id-477|title=Q: What's another word for pirate treasure?|date=2009-07-21|publisher=Telltale Games|accessdate=29 August 2009}}</ref> where the player directs Guybrush through a maze-like jungle in pursuit of hidden treasure. Found treasures translate into prizes and discounts on Telltale's website. To access this mode, the player must locate maps on the Internet, hidden on the official Telltale website and three participating ''Monkey Island'' fansites.<ref>{{cite web |title=Treasure Huntin' with us and Telltale |url=http://talesofmi.net/?p=462 |date=2009-08-14 |work=The Tales of Monkey Island Blog|publisher=LF Network, LLC|accessdate=2009-08-29}}</ref>

==Synopsis==
===Setting and characters===
{{main|World of Monkey Island}}
''Tales of Monkey Island'' is set several years after the events of ''[[Escape from Monkey Island]]''.<ref name="AdvGamers Preview"/> The designers discarded the [[Tri-Island Area]]<U+2014>the setting of the game's predecessors<U+2014>in favor of a new locale: the [[Gulf of Melange]]. The game follows [[Guybrush Threepwood]] (voiced by [[Dominic Armato]]),<ref name="Grossman interview"/> a pirate who is na<U+00EF>ve and hapless, yet successful. Before the game's beginning, Guybrush spends years locating the elements needed to create the Cursed Cutlass of Kaflu, a [[Hoodoo (folk magic)|voodoo]] weapon capable of destroying his arch-nemesis, the demon pirate [[LeChuck]] (voiced by Adam Harrington,<ref name="Ch1 credits"/> Kevin Blackton and later [[Earl Boen]]).<ref name="Ch4 credits"/> As with other ''Monkey Island'' games, LeChuck vies for the love of [[Elaine Marley|Elaine Marley-Threepwood]] (voiced by [[Alexandra Boyd]]),<ref name="Grossman interview"/> the wife of Guybrush Threepwood and former governor of the Tri-Island Area. In the events immediately before the game, LeChuck kidnaps Elaine. Guybrush pursues LeChuck with the voodoo cutlass.<ref name="ep1 plot"/>

===Plot===
Having acquired the components of the Cutlass of Kaflu, Guybrush races to the [[Rock of Gelato]] to save his wife from LeChuck; however, he fails to properly create the sword. When Guybrush stabs LeChuck, the flawed cutlass transforms LeChuck into a human, and infects Guybrush's hand with the "Pox of LeChuck", which gives the hand a mind of its own. An explosion on the ship hurls Guybrush into the ocean, and he later washes up on [[Flotsam Island]]. There, Guybrush encounters the Voodoo Lady, who explains that the pox will ravage the Caribbean, unless it is absorbed by a voodoo [[sponge|sea sponge]] called "''La Esponja Grande''" (The Big Sponge). Guybrush is advised to seek DeCava, who is on an expedition to find ''La Esponja Grande''; however, to leave the island, Guybrush must neutralize a machine that is drawing the winds inward, and thereby preventing ships from leaving. It is revealed that the Marquis de Singe is using the machine to bring pirates to the island for his medical experiments. De Singe becomes obsessed with Guybrush's hand, as he believes it to be key to eternal life. Guybrush reverts the wind patterns to normal<U+2014>unwittingly causing the pox to spread across the sea<U+2014>and departs in his newly acquired ship, the ''Screaming Narwhal''. De Singe hires Morgan LeFlay to capture Guybrush; en route to the [[Jerkbait Islands]], she boards the ''Screaming Narwhal'' and cuts off Guybrush's pox-infected hand in a duel. Afterwards, she returns it to de Singe.<ref name="ep1 plot">{{cite video game|title=Tales of Monkey Island: "Launch of the Screaming Narwhal" |developer=Telltale Games |date=July 2009 |platform=PC}}</ref><ref name="Ch2">{{cite video game|title=Tales of Monkey Island: "The Siege of Spinner Cay" |developer=Telltale Games |date=August 2009 |platform=PC}}</ref>

On the Jerkbait Islands, Guybrush finds Elaine safe, and learns that the now-human LeChuck is trying to make up for the evil deeds of his past. The three help to defend the resident [[mermaid|merfolk]] city from pox-infected pirates; in return, the merfolk summon sea creatures to assist Guybrush in locating ''La Esponja Grande''. Elaine stays behind to monitor LeChuck's actions. As Guybrush follows the creatures on the ''Screaming Narwhal'', Morgan again boards the ship; de Singe had informed her that Guybrush's entire body was needed. Distracted by their duel, neither can react in time when the ''Screaming Narwhal'' is swallowed whole by a giant [[manatee]].<ref name="Ch2"/> Inside the manatee, Guybrush and LeFlay discover DeCava and his crew; Guybrush heals the manatee's injuries, and escapes with DeCava to the location of ''La Esponja Grande''. After retrieving ''La Esponja Grande'', Morgan knocks Guybrush unconscious and sets sail for Flotsam Island with her bounty.<ref>{{cite video game|title=Tales of Monkey Island: "Lair of the Leviathan" |developer=Telltale Games |date=September 2009 |platform=PC}}</ref>

As Morgan reluctantly delivers Guybrush to de Singe, Guybrush is seized by the townspeople and put on trial for having released the pox across the Gulf of Melange. LeChuck exonerates Guybrush by implicating himself in the creation of the pox, and produces evidence that all previous confrontations between Guybrush and LeChuck had been orchestrated by the Voodoo Lady; the two are imprisoned, and Guybrush is released. As Guybrush prepares to cure the pox with ''La Esponja Grande'', he finds Morgan murdered in de Singe's laboratory. At the wind machine, de Singe traps Guybrush and Elaine, and believes that his experiments with Guybrush's hand are on the verge of granting him immortality. However, de Singe falls into the wind machine and is disintegrated; Guybrush then uses ''La Esponja Grande'' to absorb the pox. LeChuck arrives to free the two, but as Guybrush thanks him, LeChuck impales him on the Cutlass of Kaflu, and uses ''La Esponja Grande'' to transfer the pox's potency to himself.<ref>{{cite video game|title=Tales of Monkey Island: "The Trial and Execution of Guybrush Threepwood" |developer=Telltale Games |date=October 2009 |platform=PC}}</ref>

Now deceased, Guybrush finds his spiritual self at the [[Crossroads (culture)#Spirituality|crossroads]]: the place where the living and dead realms meet. With the assistance of Morgan's spirit, he finds a spell that embodies courage, anchor, direction and sacrifice, and returns to the land of the living as a ghost. However, LeChuck absorbs the massive amount of energy generated by a dimensional rift Guybrush opens; the pox was engineered by LeChuck to achieve this goal. Elaine, in an apparent act of betrayal, becomes LeChuck's demon bride. Guybrush repossesses his dead body and shrinks ''La Esponja Grande'', reversing LeChuck's hold over Elaine. LeChuck attacks Guybrush, who lures the demon pirate into the rift. There, LeChuck is simultaneously stabbed by Elaine and Morgan, which destroys his physical and spiritual forms. Stranded alone at the crossroads, Guybrush realizes that he has one more item that meets the spell's criteria for his return: Elaine's wedding ring. He uses it to restore himself to life and return to his wife. The spirit of Morgan delivers a jar containing the essence of LeChuck to the Voodoo Lady, in exchange for her return to the land of the living.<ref>{{cite video game|title=Tales of Monkey Island: "Rise of the Pirate God" |developer=Telltale Games |date=December 2009 |platform=PC}}</ref>

===Design===
[[File:Guybrush Threepwood TMI concepts.jpg|thumb|right|275px|Art direction was one area where LucasArts collaborated with Telltale; LucasArts was keen to promote a version of Guybrush that combined the character's appearances in ''Monkey Island 2'' and ''The Curse of Monkey Island'', while remaining consistent with the art style of ''The Secret of Monkey Island'' special edition. LucasArts helped provide feedback and refinements for Telltale's artists to achieve this.|alt=Several concept images of a man's head, with a goatee beard and a ponytail. On the top row, the image shows several refinements and changes between the initial and final designs, while the second row contrasts the silhouettes of the two versions]]

As with Telltale's other products, ''Tales of Monkey Island'' was developed and released in five [[episodic video game|episodic]] segments; Grossman explained that Telltale prefers to tell stories this way, rather than as continuous narratives that are too long for people to play comfortably.<ref name="GameSpot Preview"/> However, unlike their previous games, each episode is not a standalone tale; it is a single chapter in a larger plot.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.pc.ign.com/articles/990/990268p1.html|title=E3 2009: ''Tales of Monkey Island'' Preview|publisher=IGN|date=2009-06-02|first=Steve|last=Butts|accessdate=2009-06-03}}</ref> This allowed Telltale to advance the story like that of a television series, in which character relationships develop in the minds of the audience over several months.<ref name="postmortem"/> Each episode is designed to be gratifying on its own, with a satisfying conclusion; however, it then provides a cliffhanger to "tantalize the player a little more".<ref name="postmortem"/> According to Grossman, ''Tales of Monkey Island'' is set after an "imaginary" ''Monkey Island 5'', which he views as "a blockbuster, epic 40-hour gigantic experience like the earlier games". Its story would have followed Guybrush's actions in the time between ''Escape from Monkey Island'' and ''Tales of Monkey Island''; the beginning of ''Tales of Monkey Island'' would have marked its conclusion.<ref name="Grossman interview"/> Grossman maintained that both the story and gameplay of ''Tales of Monkey Island'' were designed to be accessible for newcomers to the series, and commented that "knowledge of the characters and their history will add a nostalgic layer to the sly references, but is by no means necessary".<ref name="Guardian interview">{{cite web|title=''''Tales of Monkey Island'' <U+2013> the interview|work=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian Media Group|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/gamesblog/2009/jul/02/pc-games|accessdate=2011-01-11|date=2009-07-03|last=Howson|first=Greg}}</ref>

Stemmle likened the game's episodic development to a relay race, and the development of a full game, such as ''Escape from Monkey Island'', to a "marathon".<ref name="Gorilla interview"/> This production method meant that certain aspects, such as the game's graphics, were worked on until the release deadline.<ref name="destructoid stemmle">{{cite web|url=http://www.destructoid.com/tales-of-monkey-island-q-a-with-telltale-designer-mike-stemmle-137500.phtml|title=''Tales of Monkey Island'' Q&A with Telltale Designer Mike Stemmle|publisher=Destructoid|date=2009-06-25|accessdate=2009-06-30}}</ref> Each episode took around four months to complete.<ref name="eurogamer grossman"/> Only a few environmental resources were reused between episodes; while Telltale Games had built previous games such as ''[[Sam & Max Save the World]]'' and ''Wallace & Gromit's Grand Adventures'' around one set of locations, using the protagonists' homes and nearby streets consistently in each episode, the developers forwent such central hubs and "comfort zones" in ''Tales of Monkey Island'', instead having each episode move off to a new primary location, only occasionally revisiting past locations.<ref name="AdvGamers Preview"/> However, reusable [[skeletal animation|skeletons and animations]] were developed for the supporting cast, including generic body types that could be visually altered to suit each character. While four of these were created, size constraints resulted in only two being included in the final game. By the game's third episode, Telltale became unsatisfied with this system, and began diversifying facial features, and providing supporting characters with unique silhouettes and animations.<ref name="postmortem"/>

[[File:Tales of Monkey Island ship battle.jpg|thumb|left|260px|''Tales of Monkey Island'' was the first Telltale product to dedicate significant resources to cinematography. This ship battle scene presented a challenge for the developers as it was considered too static. Lighting and weather effects creating a thunderstorm, violent camera movements simulating rough waters and ship collisions and character animation suggesting strong winds were added to present a more engaging scene.|alt=Two Age of Sail ships sail close together in rough waters off the coast of a small island in a rainstorm.

A woman is tied up towards the front of the undead pirate's ship.]]

The game's artistic direction was developed by former LucasArts members Derek Sakai and Dave Bogan;<ref name="postmortem"/> both of them had worked on ''[[The Curse of Monkey Island]]'', ''Escape from Monkey Island'', and several earlier [[LucasArts adventure games]].<ref name="Team"/> The game's final art direction was an attempt to combine the realistic look of the first two ''Monkey Island'' games with the whimsical, stylized graphics of the third.<ref name="postmortem"/> While those games feature entirely [[2D computer graphics|two-dimensional graphics]], and their successor, ''Escape from Monkey Island'', is largely [[Pre-rendering|pre-rendered]], ''Tales of Monkey Island'' is rendered in full [[3D computer graphics|3D]].<ref name="Grossman interview"/> Grossman explained that both Telltale's art department and [[game engine]] are oriented toward 3D graphics development, and that the company enjoys the benefits 3D offers in the areas of animation and cinematography.<ref name="Gorilla interview"/> Improved capacity for the latter resulted in the appointment of a "cinematic director": someone to help the designers locate scenes needing more dramatic acivity, and to assist the animators and choreographers in creating it. During development, the necessity of this position was highlighted by a ship battle scene in "Launch of the ''Screaming Narwhal''", which was initially static and unexciting. This was remedied by changing the time of day from dusk to night, adding rain and other weather effects, and using camera movement to simulate rough waters.<ref name="postmortem"/>

Regarding the puzzle design in ''Tales of Monkey Island'', Stemmle said that he and his fellow designers<U+2014>when they were younger<U+2014>believed that they needed to "stump the player"; however, Stemmle now considers it "a ''lot'' better to make the players feel smart". Therefore, the designers included a hint system to prevent players from becoming stuck.<ref name="Gorilla interview"/> Grossman explained that Telltale's designers would bear in mind how players would mentally progress through the puzzles, and consider "what realisations we expected them to have and whether those expectations are realistic".<ref name="Guardian interview"/> Due to a tight development schedule, puzzles in the first episode were not optimized for the game's control system, which was re-designed late in development.<ref name="postmortem"/> Initially, the game was to feature [[point-and-click]] controls, as had been used in the majority of Telltale's previous games.<ref name="postmortem"/> However, a "direct control" method<U+2014>similar to the one seen in ''Wallace & Gromit's Grand Adventures''<U+2014>was decided upon after much of the first episode had been planned. As the direct control in that game had been designed for an Xbox controller, the developers reworked the idea into a "click-and-drag" mouse system for ''Tales of Monkey Island''. Telltale believed that this control method made for a less passive and more engaging player experience, and provided more freedom for cinematic camera work than was possible with point-and-click.<ref name="postmortem"/>

Aside from providing the ''Monkey Island'' license to Telltale, LucasArts' role in the game's development involved collaboration and approval of the game's script, character concept art and puzzle design. As the remake of ''The Secret of Monkey Island'' had begun development before ''Tales of Monkey Island'', LucasArts shared their art style guide with Telltale, so that the two products' art direction would be similar.<ref name="Craig Derrick interview">{{cite web|url=http://www.adventureclassicgaming.com/index.php/site/interviews/536/|title=Craig Derrick <U+2013> LucasArts <U+2013> Interview|publisher=Adventure Classic Gaming|first=Mark|last=Newheiser|date=2009-12-02|accessdate=2009-12-02}}</ref> In particular, LucasArts wished that the character of Guybrush would be comparable to the appearance of the character in the special edition. LucasArts largely based their vision for Guybrush's new visuals in ''Tales of Monkey Island'' on how the character appeared in ''The Curse of Monkey Island'', integrating various aspects from ''LeChuck's Revenge'' that commonly resonated through fan art, such as the character's blue coat and beard, in addition to using their own stylized art direction.<ref name="Craig Derrick interview"/> Telltale concept artist Ryan Jones worked closely with LucasArts' Jeff Sengalli on developing the appearance of Guybrush and other characters, Sengalli providing feedback and refinement in such areas as character silhouettes, facial features and clothing.<ref name="postmortem"/> Vanaman noted that LucasArts was open to Telltale's creative direction for the game, and did not "put their foot down" over any aspects of their vision.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adventureclassicgaming.com/index.php/site/interviews/515/|title=Sean Vanaman <U+2013> Telltale Games <U+2013> Interview|publisher=Adventure Classic Gaming|first=Mark|last=Newheiser|date=2009-09-26|accessdate=2009-12-12}}</ref>

[[Dominic Armato]], the voice actor of Guybrush from ''The Curse of Monkey Island'' onward, reprises his role as that character.

===Sales===
''Tales of Monkey Island'' was a commercial success, and it exceeded Telltale's sales projections.
