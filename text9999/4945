"Novices threaten Cudahy's status quo." ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. January 2, 2007. [http://articles.latimes.com/2007/jan/02/local/me-cudahy2 1]. Retrieved on October 26, 2009.</ref> who purchased the original {{convert|2777|acre|km2|1}} of [[Rancho San Antonio (Lugo)|Rancho San Antonio]] in 1908 to resell as 1 acre lots.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} These "Cudahy lots" were notable for their dimensions<U+2014>in most cases, {{convert|50|to|100|ft|m|0}} in width and {{convert|600|to|800|ft|m|0}} in depth, a length equivalent to a [[city block]] or more in most American towns.  Such parcels, often referred to as "railroad lots", were intended to allow the new town's residents to keep a large [[vegetable garden]], a grove of [[fruit tree]]s (usually citrus), and a [[chicken coop]] or [[Stable|horse stable]].  This arrangement, popular in the towns along the lower [[Los Angeles River|Los Angeles]] and [[San Gabriel River (California)|San Gabriel]] rivers, proved particularly attractive to the Southerners and Midwesterners who were leaving their struggling farms in droves in the [[1910s]] and [[1920s]] to start new lives in [[Southern California]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} Sam Quinones of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' said that the large, narrow parcels of land gave Cudahy Acres a "rural feel in an increasingly urban swath."<ref name="Status1"/> As late as the [[1950s]], some Cudahy residents were still riding into the city's downtown areas on horseback.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} After [[World War II]] the city was a [[White American]] blue collar town with steel and automobile plants in the area.<ref name="Status1"/>

By the late 1970s, the factories and the White American residents of Cudahy left. Stucco apartment complexes were built on former tracts of land. The population density increased; in 2007 the city was the second-densest in California, after [[Maywood, California|Maywood]].<ref name="Status2">Quinones, Sam.
