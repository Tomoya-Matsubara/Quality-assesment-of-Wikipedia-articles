==Justice of the Supreme Court==
Voters were asked to fill a single vacancy on the [[Supreme Court of Pennsylvania]].

==Judge of the Superior Court==

Four seats on the Superior Court were up for grabs. On the ballot in the general election were four Republicans, four Democrats, and one [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian]].

Republican candidate Judy Olson won the most votes, followed by fellow Republicans Sallie Mundy and Paula Ott. There was a four-way near tie for fourth place, with Democrat Anne E. Lazarus in the lead (with 11.5% of the vote) but closely trailed by Democrat Robert J. Colville (11.4%), Republican Temp Smith (11.4%), and Democrat Kevin Francis McCarthy (11.3%). The close results triggered an optional automatic [[election recount|recount]]. While candidates Colville and McCarthy opted out of the recount, Smith declined to do so, prompting Secretary of State [[Pedro Cort<U+00E9>s]] to order a recount to begin on November 18<U+2014>the first automatic statewide recount in Pennsylvania history.<ref name="RecountOrdered">{{cite press release|title=Secretary of the Commonwealth Pedro A.
