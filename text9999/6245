[[Chuck Taylor (writer and editor)|Chuck Taylor]] from ''Billboard'' also praised "[[I'm Your Angel]]," a duet with [[R. Kelly]]. He wrote that "this wonderfully restrained ballad delights with the most graceful vocal performances either of these artists has ever offered to radio."<ref name="angelreview">{{cite web|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=JwoEAAAAMBAJ&printsec=frontcover&hl=pl&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=snippet&q=dion&f=false|title=Reviews & Previews > Artists & Music> Singles > Pop > I'm Your Angel|date=1998-10-17|accessdate=2012-05-01|work=Billboard|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc}}</ref> Taylor commented, "what raises the roof is the tune's elegant, epic instrumental base, which includes sweeping strings, a soulful choir, and gentle but determined percussive drive."<ref name="angelreview"/> He continued, that "I'm Your Angel" "sells big at the bridge, where the instrumentation drops and Kelly and Dion harmonize in a gorgeous minor key <U+2013> it truly makes the song."<ref name="angelreview"/> Chuck Taylor also reviewed "The Prayer", calling it "a breathtaking, ultra-lush song, and the tour de force combination of Dion and Bocelli [which] will send a half-dozen chills up your spine."<ref name="prayerreview">{{cite web|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=nw4EAAAAMBAJ&printsec=frontcover&hl=pl&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q=dion&f=false|title=Reviews & Previews > Artists & Music> Singles > AC > The Prayer|date=1999-03-20|accessdate=2012-05-01|work=Billboard|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc}}</ref> Although he felt that the song is "an unorthodox track for the radio", Taylor called it "affecting," "heartwarming," "absolutely exquisite" and "one of Dion's most radiant performances ever."<ref name="prayerreview"/>

Stephen Thomas Erlewine of [[Allmusic]] stated that "any fan of Dion, or of '90s adult contemporary pop in general, should find this [album] very enjoyable."<ref name="allmusic"/> Although according to him, "at times, the production is too slick" and "at other times Dion's vocals are a little mannered," overall, ''These Are Special Times'' "is very effective, because the songs are good and she's committed to the material."<ref name="allmusic"/> Erlewine wrote that ''These Are Special Times'' is "an especially successful holiday album since Dion wisely balances" popular carols ("[[Blue Christmas]]," "[[The Christmas Song]]," "Feliz Navidad") with new songs ("I'm Your Angel," "Don't Save It All for Christmas"), hymns ("Adeste Fideles," "Ave Maria"), and Christmas songs with a distinct religious theme ("The Prayer," "O Holy Night")."<ref name="allmusic"/>
