The variation is due to confusion over what actually constitutes the start and end of a war.  Some sources take the start of the war as the order to open fire at 9:00&nbsp;am and some with the start of actual firing at 9:02&nbsp;am.  The end of the war is usually put at 9:40&nbsp;am when the last shots were fired and the palace flag struck, but some sources place it at 9:45&nbsp;am.

The '''Anglo-Zanzibar War''' was fought between the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Zanzibar]] on 27 August 1896. The conflict lasted around 40 minutes<ref group=nb name="duration"/> and is the shortest [[war]] in recorded history.<ref>{{citation|title= Guinness World Records 2008 |year=2007 |publisher= [[Guinness World Records]] |location= London |isbn= 978-1904994190 |page=118}}.</ref>  The immediate cause of the war was the death of the pro-British [[Sultan]] [[Hamad bin Thuwaini of Zanzibar|Hamad bin Thuwaini]] on 25 August 1896 and the subsequent succession of [[Khalid bin Barghash of Zanzibar|Sultan Khalid bin Barghash]]. The British authorities preferred [[Hamud bin Muhammed of Zanzibar|Hamud bin Muhammed]], who was more favourable to them, as Sultan. In accordance with a treaty signed in 1886, a condition for [[accession]] to the sultancy was that the candidate obtain the permission of the British [[Consul]], and Khalid had not fulfilled this requirement. The British considered this a [[casus belli]] and sent an [[ultimatum]] to Khalid demanding that he order his forces to stand down and leave the palace. In response, Khalid called up his palace guard and barricaded himself inside the palace.

The ultimatum expired at 9:00&nbsp;am [[East Africa Time]] (EAT) on 27 August, by which time the British had gathered three [[cruisers]], two [[gunships]], 150 [[marines]] and [[sailor]]s and 900 Zanzibaris in the harbour area.  The Royal Navy contingent were under the command of [[Rear-Admiral]] [[Harry Rawson]] whilst the Zanzibaris were commanded by [[Brigadier-General]] [[Lloyd Mathews]] of the Zanzibar army.  Around 2,800 Zanzibaris defended the palace; most were recruited from the civilian population, but they also included the Sultan's palace guard and several hundred of his servants and slaves. The defenders had several [[artillery]] pieces and [[machine guns]] which were set in front of the palace sighted at the British ships. A [[bombardment]] was opened at 9:02&nbsp;am which set the palace on fire and disabled the defending artillery. A small naval action took place with the British sinking a Zanzibari [[royal yacht]] and two smaller vessels, and some shots were fired ineffectually at the pro-British Zanzibari troops as they approached the palace. The flag at the palace was shot down and fire ceased at 9:40&nbsp;am.

The Sultan's forces sustained roughly 500 casualties, while only one British sailor was injured. Sultan Khalid received [[political asylum|asylum]] in the German [[consulate]] before escaping to [[Tanganyika]]. The British quickly placed Sultan Hamud in power at the head of a [[puppet government]]; he abolished slavery within a few months. The war marked the end of Zanzibar as a [[sovereign state]] and the start of a period of heavy British influence.

== Origins ==
[[Image:Anglo-Zanzibar war map.gif|thumb|left|Zanzibar and the African mainland]]
Zanzibar was an island country in the [[Indian Ocean]], off the coast of Tanganyika; today it forms part of [[Tanzania]].  The island had been under the nominal control of the [[Sultan of Oman|Sultans of Oman]] since 1698 when they expelled the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] settlers who had claimed it in 1499.<ref name="hernon397">{{Harvnb|Hernon|2003|p=397}}.</ref>  Sultan [[Majid bin Said of Zanzibar|Majid bin Said]] declared the island independent of Oman in 1858, which was recognised by Great Britain, and split the Sultancy from that of Oman.<ref name="hernon397"/>  The subsequent Sultans established their capital and seat of government at [[Zanzibar Town]] where a palace complex was built on the sea front.  By 1896, this consisted of the palace itself; the Beit al-Hukm, an attached harem; and the Beit al-Hajaib or "House of Wonders"&mdash;a ceremonial palace said to be the first building in East Africa to be provided with electricity.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hoyle|2002|pp=156<U+2013>157}}.</ref>  The complex was mostly constructed of local timber and was not designed as a defensive structure.<ref name="hernon402">{{Harvnb|Hernon|2003|p=402}}.</ref>  All three main buildings were adjacent to one another in a line, and linked by wooden covered bridges above street height.<ref name="hoyle160">{{Harvnb|Hoyle|2002|p=160}}.</ref>

Britain had had a long period of interaction with Zanzibar and had recognised the island's [[sovereignty]] and its Sultancy in 1886.<ref name="hernon397"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Bennett|1978|pp=131<U+2013>132}}.</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Hernon|2000|pp=146<U+2013>147}}.</ref>  As a result Britain generally maintained friendly relations with the country and its Sultans.<ref name="hernon397"/>  However, [[Germany]] was also interested in East Africa and the two powers vied for control of trade rights and territory in the area throughout the late 19th century.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bennett|1978|pp=124<U+2013>131}}.</ref>  Sultan [[Khalifah bin Said of Zanzibar|Khalifah]] had granted rights to the land of [[Kenya]] to Britain and that of Tanganyika to Germany, a process resulting in the prohibition of slavery in those lands.
<ref name="hernon397"/>  Many of the [[Arab]] ruling classes were upset by this interruption of a valuable trade, which resulted in some unrest.<ref name="hernon397"/>  In addition, the German authorities in Tanganyika refused to fly the flag of the Zanzibar Sultancy, which led to armed clashes between German troops and the local population.<ref name="hernon398">{{Harvnb|Hernon|2003|p=398}}.</ref>  One such conflict in [[Tanga, Tanzania|Tanga]] claimed the lives of 20 Arabs.<ref name="hernon398"/>

Sultan Khalifah sent Zanzibari troops led by General Lloyd Mathews, a former [[Lieutenant]] of the [[Royal Navy]], to restore order in Tanganyika.<ref name="Hernon147">{{Harvnb|Hernon|2000|p=147}}.</ref> The operation was largely successful, but anti-German feeling amongst the Zanzibari people remained strong.<ref name="hernon398"/>  Further conflicts erupted at [[Bagamoyo]] where 150 natives were killed by German military forces and at [[Ketwa]] where German officials and their servants were murdered.<ref name="Hernon147"/>  Khalifah then granted extensive trade rights to the [[Imperial British East Africa Company]] (IBEAC) who, with German assistance, ran a naval blockade to halt the continuing domestic slave trade.<ref name="Hernon147"/>  Upon Khalifah's death in 1890 [[Ali bin Said of Zanzibar|Ali bin Said]] ascended to the Sultancy.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bennett|1978|p=165}}.</ref>  Sultan Ali banned the domestic slave trade (but not slave ownership), declared Zanzibar a British protectorate and appointed a British [[First Minister]] to lead his [[cabinet]]. The British were also guaranteed a veto over the future appointment of Sultans.<ref name="hernon399">{{Harvnb|Hernon|2003|p=399}}.</ref>

The year of Ali's ascension also saw the signing of the [[Heligoland-Zanzibar Treaty]] between Britain and Germany.  This treaty officially [[demarcation|demarcated]] the [[sphere of interest|spheres of interest]] in East Africa and ceded Germany's rights in Zanzibar to the United Kingdom.<ref>{{Citation  | publisher=German History in Documents and Images| title = Text of the Heligoland-Zanzibar Treaty |date= 1 July 1890 |url=  http://germanhistorydocs.ghi-dc.org/pdf/eng/606_Anglo-German%20Treaty_110.pdf |accessdate= 08-09-29}}</ref>  This granted the British government more influence in Zanzibar which they intended to use to eradicate slavery there, an objective they had held as early as 1804.<ref>{{cite hansard | url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1890/aug/01/the-anglo-german-agreement | house= House of Commons| date=1 August 1890 | column_start=1530 | column_end=1533 }}</ref><ref>{{cite hansard | url= http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1804/aug/22/class-v#S4V0029P0-01165| house=House of Commons | date= 22 August 1804| column_start= 324| column_end=337}}</ref>

Sultan Ali's successor was [[Hamad bin Thuwaini of Zanzibar|Hamad bin Thuwaini]], who became Sultan in 1893.  Hamad maintained a close relationship with the British but there was dissent amongst his subjects over the increasing British control over the country, the British-led army and the abolition of the valuable slave trade.<ref name="hernon399"/>  In order to control this dissent, the British authorities authorised the Sultan to raise a Zanzibari palace bodyguard of 1,000 men, but these troops were soon involved in clashes with the British-led police.<ref name="Hernon148">{{Harvnb|Hernon|2000|p=148}}.</ref><ref name="bennett178">{{Harvnb|Bennett|1978|p=178}}.</ref>  Complaints about the bodyguards' activities were also received from the European residents in Zanzibar Town.<ref name="hernon399"/>

== 25 August ==
[[Image:HMS Thrush.jpg|thumb|HMS ''Thrush'']]
Sultan Hamad died suddenly at 11:40&nbsp;am EAT (8:40 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on 25 August 1896.<ref name="hernon399"/> His 29 year-old nephew [[Khalid bin Barghash of Zanzibar|Khalid bin Bargash]], who was suspected by some of his assassination,<ref name="hernon399"/> moved into the palace complex at Zanzibar Town without British approval, in contravention of the treaty agreed with Ali.<ref name="hernon399"/> The British government preferred an alternative candidate, Hamud bin Muhammed, who was more favourably disposed towards them.  Khalid was warned by the Consul and Diplomatic Agent to Zanzibar, Basil Cave, and General Mathews to think carefully about his actions.<ref name="hernon400">{{Harvnb|Hernon|2003|p=400}}.</ref><ref name="Bennett178">{{Harvnb|Bennett|1978|p=178}}.</ref>  This course of action had proved successful three years earlier when Khalid had tried to claim the sultancy after the death of Ali and the British Consul-General, Rennell Rodd, had persuaded him of the dangers of such an action.<ref name="Tucker194">{{Harvnb|Tucker|1970|p=194}}.</ref>

Khalid ignored Cave's warning and his forces began mustering in the Palace Square under the command of Captain Saleh of the palace bodyguard. By the end of the day, they numbered 2,800 men armed with rifles and muskets.<ref name="hernon400"/> The majority were civilians but the force included 700 Zanzibari Askari soldiers who had sided with Khalid.<ref name="NYT warning">{{citation|last=|first=|title=A Warning to Said Khalid|newspaper=The New York Times|date=27 August 1896|page=p. 5|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9405E2D91E3AE533A25754C2A96E9C94679ED7CF| accessdate = 2008-10-16}}.</ref><ref name="hernon400"/>  The Sultan's artillery, which consisted of several [[Maxim machine gun]]s, a [[Gatling gun]], a seventeenth century bronze cannon and two 12 pounder [[field guns]], was aimed at the British ships in the harbour.<ref name="patience9">{{Harvnb|Patience|1994|p=9}}.</ref><ref name="hernon400"/><ref name="NYT warning"/>  The 12 pounders had been presented to the Sultan by [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]], the German Emperor.<ref name="hernon400"/>  The Sultan's troops also took possession of the Zanzibari Navy which consisted of one wooden sloop, the [[HHS Glasgow|HHS ''Glasgow'']], built as a [[royal yacht]] for the Sultan in 1878 based on the British frigate [[HMS Glasgow (1861)|HMS ''Glasgow'']].<ref name="patience5">{{Harvnb|Patience|1994|p=5}}.</ref>

Mathews and Cave also began to muster their forces, already commanding 900 Zanzibari [[askari]]s under Lieutenant [[Arthur Edward Harington Raikes]] of the [[Wiltshire Regiment]] who was seconded to the Zanzibar Army and held the rank of [[Brigadier-General]].<ref name="hernon400"/>  150 sailors and marines were landed from the [[Pearl class cruiser|''Pearl'' class]] [[protected cruiser]] [[HMS Philomel (1890)|HMS ''Philomel'']] and the [[gunboat]] [[HMS Thrush (1889)|HMS ''Thrush'']] which were anchored in the harbour.<ref name="hernon400"/> The naval contingent, under the command of Captain O'Callaghan, came ashore within fifteen minutes of being requested to deal with any rioting caused by the general population.<ref name="hernon400"/><ref>{{citation|last=|first=|title=Zanzibar's Sultan Dead|newspaper=The New York Times|date=26 August 1896|page=p. 5| url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9C0CE5D91E3AE533A25755C2A96E9C94679ED7CF| accessdate=2008-10-16}}.</ref> A smaller contingent of sailors under Lieutenant Watson of ''Thrush'' were put ashore to guard the British consulate, where British citizens were requested to gather for protection.<ref name="hernon400"/> [[HMS Sparrow (1889)|HMS ''Sparrow'']], another gunship, entered the harbour and was anchored opposite the palace next to ''Thrush''.<ref name="hernon400"/>

Some concerns were raised among the British diplomats as to the reliability of Raikes' askaris, but they proved to be steady and professional troops hardened by good [[military drill]] and several expeditions to East Africa.  They would later become the only land troops to be fired upon by the defenders.<ref name="hernon403"/>  Raikes' troops were armed with two Maxim guns and a nine pounder cannon, and were stationed at the nearby customs house.<ref name="patience8">{{Harvnb|Patience|1994|p=8}}.</ref>  The sultan attempted to have the US consul, [[Richard Dorsey Mohun]], recognise his accession but the messenger was told that "as his accession had not been verified by Her Majesty's Government, it is impossible to reply."<ref name="patience9"/>

Cave continued to send messages to Khalid requesting that he stand down his troops, leave the palace and return home but these were ignored and Khalid replied that he would proclaim himself Sultan at 3:00 pm. Cave stated that this would constitute an act of rebellion and that Khalid's sultancy would not be recognised by the British government.<ref name="hernon400"/> At 2:30 pm, Sultan Hamad was buried and exactly 30 minutes later a [[Royal Salute]] from the palace guns proclaimed Khalid's succession. Cave could not open hostilities without government approval and telegraphed the following message to the [[Foreign Office]] of [[Lord Salisbury|Lord Salisbury's]] administration in London: "Are we authorised in the event of all attempts at a peaceful solution proving useless, to fire on the Palace from the men-of-war?"<ref name="Owens2">{{Harvnb|Owens|2007|p=2}}.</ref> Meanwhile, Cave informed all other foreign consuls that all flags were to remain at half mast in honour of the late Hamad. The only one that did not was a large red flag flying from Khalid's palace.  Cave also informed the consuls not to recognise Khalid as Sultan, to which they agreed.<ref>{{citation|last=|first=|title=Sultan of Zanzibar Dead|newspaper=The New York Times|date=19 July 1902|page=p. 9|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9B06EFD71E3BEE33A2575AC1A9619C946397D6CF|accessdate=2008-10-16}}.</ref>

== 26 August ==
[[Image:St_George_and_Philomel.jpg|right|thumb|HMS ''St George'' and HMS ''Philomel'' in the harbour]]
At 10:00&nbsp;am on 26 August, the [[Archer class cruiser|''Archer'' class]] protected cruiser [[HMS Racoon (1887)|HMS ''Racoon'']] arrived at Zanzibar Town and was anchored in line with ''Thrush'' and ''Sparrow''. At 2:00 pm, the [[Edgar class cruiser|''Edgar'' class]] protected cruiser [[HMS St George (1892)|HMS ''St George'']], [[flagship]] of the Cape and East Africa Station, steamed into the harbour. Onboard were [[Rear-Admiral]] [[Harry Rawson]] and further British marines and sailors. At around the same time Lord Salisbury's reply arrived authorising Cave and Rawson to use the resources at their disposal to remove Khalid from power.<ref name="hernon401">{{Harvnb|Hernon|2003|p=401}}.</ref>  The telegraph read: "You are authorised to adopt whatever measures you may consider necessary, and will be supported in your action by Her Majesty's Government. Do not, however, attempt to take any action which you are not certain of being able to accomplish successfully."<ref name="Owens2"/>

Cave attempted further negotiations with Khalid but these failed and Rawson sent an [[ultimatum]], requiring him to haul down his flag and leave the palace by 9:00&nbsp;am on 27 August or he would open fire. During the afternoon, all merchant vessels were cleared from the harbour and the British women and children removed to ''St. George'' and a [[British-India Steam Navigation Company]] vessel for their safety. That night, Consul Mohun noted that: "The silence which hung over Zanzibar was appalling.  Usually drums were beating or babies cried but that night there was absolutely not a sound."<ref name="patience11">{{Harvnb|Patience|1994|p=11}}.</ref>

== 27 August ==
[[Image:Anglo-Zanzibar War without gunfire.svg|left|thumb|Dispositions of naval forces at 9.00&nbsp;am]]
At 8:00&nbsp;am on the morning of 27 August, after a messenger sent by Khalid requested [[parley]] from Cave, the consul replied that he would only have salvation if he agreed to the terms of the ultimatum.<ref name="hernon402"/><ref name="Lyne200">{{Harvnb|Lyne|1905|p=200}}.</ref>  At 8.30&nbsp;am a further messenger from Khalid declared that "We have no intention of hauling down our flag and we do not believe you would open fire on us"; Cave replied that "We do not want to open fire, but unless you do as you are told we shall certainly do so."<ref name="patience11"/>  At 8:55&nbsp;am, having received no further word from the palace, aboard ''St George'' Rawson hoisted the signal "prepare for action".<ref name="Lyne201">{{Harvnb|Lyne|1905|p=201}}.</ref>

At exactly 9:00&nbsp;am, General Lloyd Mathews ordered the British ships to commence the bombardment.<ref name="Owens2"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Thompson|1984|p=64}}.</ref> At 9:02&nbsp;am Her Majesty's Ships ''Racoon'', ''Thrush'' and ''Sparrow'' opened fire at the palace simultaneously, ''Thrush's'' first shot immediately dismounted an Arab 12-pounder cannon. 3,000 defenders, servants and slaves were present in the largely wooden palace and even with barricades of crates, bales and rubber, there were many casualties from the [[high explosive]] shells. Despite initial reports that he had been captured and was to be exiled to [[India]], Sultan Khalid escaped from the palace.<ref>{{citation|last=|first=|title= Bombarded by the British |newspaper= The New York Times |date=28 August 1896 |page=p. 1 |url= http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9800E0D91E3AE533A2575BC2A96E9C94679ED7CF |accessdate= 2008-10-16}}.</ref><ref name="hernon402"/> A [[Reuters]] news correspondent reported that the Sultan had "fled at the first shot with all the leading Arabs, who left their slaves and followers to carry on the fighting", but other sources state that he remained in the palace for longer.<ref name="hernon402"/><ref name="Scientific">{{Harvnb|Scientific American|1896}}.</ref> The shelling ceased at around 9:40&nbsp;am, by which time the palace and attached harem had caught fire, the enemy artillery had been silenced and the Sultan's flag cut down.<ref name="hernon403"/>

[[Image:Zanzibar palace after low.JPG|right|thumb|The palace complex following the bombardment]]
During the bombardment a small naval engagement occurred when, at 9:05&nbsp;am, the obsolete ''Glasgow'' fired upon the ''St George'' using her armament of 7 nine-pounder guns and a Gatling gun which had been a present from Queen Victoria to the Sultan.<ref name="Patience6">{{Harvnb|Patience|1994|p=6}}.</ref>  The returning fire caused ''Glasgow'' to sink, though the shallow harbour meant that her masts remained out of the water.<ref name="hernon403"/>  ''Glasgow''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s crew hoisted a British flag as a token of their surrender and they were all rescued by British sailors in [[launch (boat)|launches]].<ref name="hernon403"/> ''Thrush'' also sank two steam launches whose Zanzibari crews shot at her with rifles. Some land fighting occurred when Khalid's men fired on Raikes' askaris, with little effect, as they approached the palace.<ref name="hernon403"/>  The fighting ceased with the end of the shelling. The British controlled the town and the palace and by the afternoon Hamud bin Muhammed, an Arab favourable to the British, had been installed as Sultan with much reduced powers.<ref name="hernon404">{{Harvnb|Hernon|2003|p=404}}.</ref>  The British ships and crews had fired around 500 shells, 4,100 machine gun rounds and 1,000 rifle rounds during the engagement.<ref name="Patience14">{{Harvnb|Patience|1994|p=14}}.</ref>

[[Image:Marines in zanzibar.jpg|thumb|British sailors pose with a captured cannon outside the Sultan's palace.]]
Around 500 Zanzibari men and women were killed or wounded during the bombardment, with most of the dead killed as a result of the fire that engulfed the palace.<ref name="hernon403"/><ref name="bennett179"/> It is unknown how many of these casualties were combatants, but Khalid's gun crews were said to have been "decimated".<ref name="patience12">{{Harvnb|Patience|1994|p=12}}.</ref>  British casualties amounted to one [[Petty Officer]] severely wounded aboard ''Thrush'' who later recovered.<ref name="hernon403"/>  Although the majority of the Zanzibari townspeople sided with the British, the town's [[India]]n quarter suffered from opportunistic looting and around twenty inhabitants lost their lives in the chaos.<ref name="patience15">{{Harvnb|Patience|1994|p=15}}.</ref>  In order to restore order 150 British [[Sikh]] troops were transferred from Mombasa to patrol the streets.<ref name="hernon404"/>  Sailors from ''St George'' and ''Philomel'' were landed to form a [[fire brigade]] to contain the fire which had spread from the palace to the nearby customs sheds.<ref name="patience20-22">{{Harvnb|Patience|1994|pp=20&ndash;22}}.</ref>  There was some concern about the fire at the customs sheds as they contained a sizeable store of explosives, but fortunately no explosion occurred.<ref name="patience12"/>

At 10:00&nbsp;am on 2 October, [[SMS Seeadler|SMS ''Seeadler'']] of the [[Kaiserliche Marine|German Navy]] arrived in port; at high tide, one of Seeadler's boats made it up to the consulate's garden gate and Khalid stepped directly from consular grounds to a German war vessel and hence was free from arrest.<ref name="Frankl163"/>  He was transferred from the boat onto the ''Seeadler'' and was then taken to [[Dar es Salaam]] in German East Africa.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ingrams|1967|pp=174<U+2013>175}}.</ref> Khalid was captured by British forces in 1916, during the [[East African Campaign (World War I)|East African Campaign]] of [[World War I]], and exiled to [[Seychelles]] and [[Saint Helena]] before being allowed to return to East Africa, where he died at [[Mombasa]] in 1927.<ref name="Frankl161">{{Harvnb|Frankl|2006|p=161}}.</ref> Khalid's supporters were punished by being forced to pay reparations to cover the cost of shells fired against them and for damages caused by the looting which amounted to 300,000 [[Indian rupee|rupees]].<ref name="hernon404"/>

Sultan Hamud was loyal to the British and acted as a [[puppet ruler|figurehead]] for an essentially British-run government, the Sultancy only being retained to avoid the costs involved with running Zanzibar directly as a [[crown colony]].<ref name="hernon404"/>  Several months after the war, Hamud, with British prompting, abolished slavery in all its forms.<ref name="hernon404"/> The emancipation of slaves required them to present themselves to a government office and proved a slow process<U+2014>within ten years only 17,293 slaves had been freed, from an estimated population of 60,000 in 1891.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bakari|2001|pp=49<U+2013>50}}.</ref>
