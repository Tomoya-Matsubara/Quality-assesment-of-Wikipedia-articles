'''Antoin "Tony" Rezko''' (born [[1955]] in [[Aleppo]], [[Syria]]) is an [[United States of America|American]] political fundraiser, [[restaurant|restaurateur]], and [[real estate]] developer in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]] convicted on several counts of [[fraud]] and [[bribery]] in 2008.  Rezko has been involved in fundraising for local Illinois [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] politicians since the 1980s.  He focused primarily on Chicago-area Democrats; for example, Rezko was one of [[Barack Obama]]'s first financial contributors. After becoming a major contributor to [[Rod Blagojevich]]'s successful gubernatorial election, Rezko assisted Blagojevich in setting up the state's first Democratic administration in twenty years.  Rezko was able to have business associates appointed onto several state boards. Rezko and several others were indicted on federal charges in October 2006, for using their connections to the state boards to demand [[Political corruption#kickback|kickbacks]] from businesses that wanted to do business with the state. While the others plead guilty to the charges, Rezko plead not guilty and was found guilty of 16 of the 24 charges filed against him.

== Early life and education ==
Rezko was born in 1955 in [[Aleppo]], [[Syria]] to a prominent Catholic family.<ref name=chicagomag>{{cite web|url=http://chicagomag.com/core/pagetools.php?pageid=7030&url=%2FChicago-Magazine%2FNovember-2007%2FMr-Inside-Out%2F&mode=print | title=Mr. Inside Out | publisher=Chicago Magazone | author=Merriner, James L. | accessdate=2008-05-10}}</ref> After graduating from high school there, Rezko moved to [[Chicago]] and earned an undergraduate and a master's degree in civil engineering from the [[Illinois Institute of Technology]] in the late 1970s. He joined an engineering company, designing nuclear power plants, then left to design roads for the state Transportation Department, making $21,590 in his one year there.<ref name=Fund-raising>{{citation| last=Jackson | first=David | last2=Chase | first2=John | url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-0610120112oct12,0,3093652.story |title=Rezko's life a story of pizza and politics | newspaper=Chicago Tribune | date=[[2006-10-12]] | accessdate=[[2007-02-06]]}}</ref><ref name = Novak2>{{cite web|url=http://www.suntimes.com/news/metro/355099,cst-nws-rez24a.article |title=Broken promises, broken homes | work=Chicago Sun-Times | author=Novak, Tim | date=2007-04-24 | accessdate=2008-05-10}}</ref>

== Business history ==
Soon after beginning his career as a civil engineer, Rezko started investing in real estate and fast-food restaurants<U+2014>including the first [[Subway (restaurant)|Subway]] in Chicago. Many of these properties were in lower-income African American neighborhoods.<ref name=chicagomag/><ref name=salon/> Then, meeting Jabir Herbert Muhammad, former manager of heavyweight champion [[Muhammad Ali]] and son of the late [[Nation of Islam]] leader, [[Elijah Muhammad]], he was asked in 1983 to support the successful mayoral candidacy of [[Harold Washington]]. J. H. Muhammad's company, Crucial Concessions, which Rezko went to work for in 1984, won a food contract at the Lake Michigan beaches and in many South Side parks after Washington became the first black mayor of Chicago. Rezko put together endorsement deals for Ali, became the executive director of the Muhammad Ali Foundation, and traveled the world with Ali for five years.<ref name=chicagomag/> In 1997, Crucial opened two Panda Express Restaurants at O'Hare, under the city's minority set-aside program. It lost those franchises in 2005, on the grounds that J. H. Muhammad was merely a front for Rezko, who had been appointed trustee of J.H. Muhammad's affairs in the early 1990s because of the latter's failing health. In March 2008 Muhammad sued Rezko, alleging that he had been swindled out of his home and business interests.<ref name=salon>{{cite web|url= http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2008/02/01/rezko/print.html |title=How close were Barack Obama and Tony Rezko? | publisher=Salon | author=McClelland, Edward | date=2008-02-01 | accessdate=2008-05-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/14/us/politics/14rezko.html?_r=1&oref=slogin&pagewanted=print |title=An Obama Patron and Friend Until an Indictment | work=The New York Times | date=2007-06-14 | accessdate=2008-05-10}}</ref><ref name=Novak2/>

In January 1989, Rezko and Daniel Mahru, CEO of a firm which leased ice makers to bars, hotels and restaurants and a former attorney, founded a real-estate development and restaurant holding corporation called Rezmar Corporation. Six days after [[Richard M. Daley]] won his first term as mayor in 1989, having campaigned on a promise to build more housing for the poor, they applied for a $629,000 loan to help fix up an abandoned apartment building. Rezmar stopped making monthly payments after just three years, then renegotiated a payment of less than 16% of the original, after missing 16 payments. They were meanwhile given two more loans for other projects, both of which ended in foreclosure. The last loan was advanced in 1998, and the deal included three of Mayor Daley's top African-American allies: Bishop Arthur Brazier, Leon Finney Jr. and Allison Davis.<ref name=Novak2/> Between 1989 and 1998, Rezmar made deals to rehab 30 buildings, a total of 1,025 apartments, expending more than $100 million from the city, state and federal governments and in bank loans. Rezko and Mahru weren't responsible for any government or bank loans or the $50 million in federal tax credits they got to rehab the buildings. Rezmar put just $100 into each project and got a 1% stake as the general partner in charge of hiring the architect, contractor, and the company that would manage the buildings, screen tenants and make repairs, Chicago Property Management, also owned by Rezko and Mahru. It also got upfront development fees of at least $6.9 million in all. Under its deals with the Chicago Equity Fund, Rezmar promised to cover all operating losses in any building for seven years, but had no obligation after that, although the tax credits they sold could be recovered by the Federal government from the holders if the projects did not survive for fifteen years or more.<ref name=Novak2/> By 1998 the company had a net worth of [[United States dollar|US$]]34 million,<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.suntimes.com/news/metro/355100,CST-NWS-rezcast24.article | title=A Rezmar who's-who list | work=Chicago Sun-Times | date=2007-04-24 | accessdate=2008-03-09}}</ref><ref name=Novak>{{cite news | author=Novak, Tim | title=Obama and his Rezko ties | work=Chicago Sun-Times | date=2007-04-23 | url=http://www.suntimes.com/news/metro/353829,CST-NWS-rez23.article | accessdate=2008-03-05}}</ref> and it then turned to purchasing old factories and parcels of land in [[gentrification|gentrifying]] areas of Chicago and turning them into upscale condominium complexes.<ref name=Novak2/><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=87830023 | title=Q&A: The Tony Rezko Case | author=David Schaper | date=2008-03-06 | accessdate=2008-03-09}}</ref>

Rezko was named "Entrepreneur of the Decade" by the Arab-American Business and Professional Association.<ref name=hanania>{{cite web | url=http://www.hanania.com/profiles/Rezko06-08-05.htm | title= Arabs in Chicago discover political clout and controversy | author=Ray Hanania | publisher=Arab American Media Services | date=2005-06-08 | accessdate=2008-01-31}}</ref>

Rezko's investment in restaurant food chains had started with a chain of [[Panda Express]] Chinese restaurants. In 1998, Rezko opened his first chain of [[Papa John's Pizza]] restaurants in Chicago and by 2002, he had twenty-six stores in Chicago, at least fifteen in [[Wisconsin]], and seven in Detroit, part of the financing for these stores was through [[GE Capital]].<ref name=Fund-raising/> By 2001, Rezko began to fall behind on his franchise payments and loans and he transferred the franchises to several business associates. In 2006, during a lawsuit with Papa John's over his franchise fees, Rezko renamed his Papa John's restaurants to Papa Tony's.<ref name=hanania/> Rezko also had a lien filed against his home after losing a civil lawsuit to GE Capital.<ref name=Fund-raising/>

== Legal troubles ==
In October 2006, Rezko was indicted along with Republican fundraiser and businessman Stuart Levine on charges of wire fraud, bribery, money laundering, and attempted extortion as a result of a federal investigation known as "Operation Board Games".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagobusiness.com/downloads/rezkoindict.pdf|title=Indictment - U.S. vs. Levine and Rezko|format=PDF publisher=Chicago Business | accessdate=2008-05-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,335592,00.html | title=Courtroom Wire: Notes From Tony Rezko's Corruption Trial | publisher=FOXNews | author=Marla Cichowski | date=2008-04-04 | accessdate=2008-04-06}}</ref> Rezko and Levine were charged with attempting to extort millions of dollars from businesses seeking to do business with the Illinois Teachers Retirement System Board and the Illinois Health Facilities Planning Board from 2002 to 2004. Levine pleaded guilty and agreed to testify against Rezko and others. While the charges carry a maximum sentence of life in prison, Levine expects to receive about a 5-1/2&nbsp;year sentence in return for his testimony.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-rezko-19mar19,0,5503877.story | title=Levine weaves tawdry tale | work=Chicago Tribune | author=Secter, Bob | coauthors=Coen, Jeff | date=2008-03-19 | accessdate=2008-05-10}}</ref> The case was prosecuted by [[Patrick Fitzgerald]] who prosecuted the case against [[Scooter Libby]] arising from the [[CIA leak scandal]].

Rezko pleaded not guilty, and the trial related to his charges from Operation Board Games began on [[March 6]], [[2008]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/chi-0307edit1mar07,1,5412814.story | title=One Tony, three trials | work=Chicago Tribune | date=2008-03-07 | accessdate=2008-05-10}}</ref> He was jailed shortly before the trial began when he received a $3.5&nbsp;million wire transfer from Lebanon. Rezko had told the court that he had no access to money from overseas. Ten weeks into the trial, on [[April 18]], Judge Amy St. Eve released Rezko, after friends and relatives put up 30 properties valued at about $8.5&nbsp;million to secure his bond. Prosecutors opposed the motion for release, saying that Rezko was a flight risk.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-rezko-fridayapr20,1,7431091.story | title=Rezko free on bail | work= Chicago Tribune |date=Coen, Jeff | date=2008-04-20 | accessdate=2008-05-10}}</ref> On [[May 6]], both the prosecution and the defense rested their cases. Government prosecutors spent 8 weeks presenting their case. Rezko<U+2019>s lawyer, Joseph J. Duffy, chose not to present any witnesses, saying that he did not believe that the prosecution had proven the charges.<ref>{{cite news  | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/06/us/06brfs-002.html?ref=us | title=Illinois: No Defense Witnesses for Rezko | work=The New York Times | | author=Einhorn Catrin | date=2008-05-06 | accessdate=2008-05-10}}</ref> Prosecutors contended that they had shown Rezko's "corrupt use of his power and influence" to gain benefits for himself and his friends. Duffy argued that the prosecution had exaggerated Rezko's influence in state government, and attacked Levine's credibility as a witness.<ref>[http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-rezko_for_tuesdaymay13,0,553455.story Corrupt mastermind or victim of frame-up?] Chicago Tribune, May 13, 2008</ref>

The case went to the jury on [[May 13]] and after three weeks of deliberation, the jury found Rezko guilty of six counts of wire fraud, six counts of mail fraud, two counts of corrupt solicitation, and two counts of money laundering, but found him not guilty on three counts of wire and mail fraud, one count of attempted extortion, and four counts of corrupt solicitation.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://abclocal.go.com/wls/story?section=news/politics&id=6185320 | title=Rezko found guilty on 16 counts | publisher=ABCNews | date=2008-06-04 | accessdate=2008-06-04}}</ref> According to CBS News the "high-profile federal trial provided an unusually detailed glimpse of the pay-to-play politics that has made Illinois infamous."<ref>{{cite news | url=http://cbs2chicago.com/local/rezko.trial.verdict.2.740375.html | title=Jury Finds Tony Rezko Guilty On 16 Of 24 Charges | publisher=CBS 2 | author=Parker, Mike | date=2008-06-04 | accessdate=2008-06-04}}</ref>

== Ties to politicians ==
=== Ties to Rod Blagojevich ===

Rezko's closest ties have been to Illinois Governor [[Rod Blagojevich]] and his family and its the influence Rezko gained from these ties that were at the root of Rezko's conviction.<ref name=Fund-raising/> Rezko has donated $117,652 to Blagojevich's campaigns,<ref name=salon/> and is credited by the prosecutor in his trial with having delivered [[Bundling (fundraising)|bundled]] contributions totalling almost $1.44 million.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/iln/hot/us_v_rezko_exhibits/2008_03_07/fob_chart_2.pdf |title=FOB Chart 2 | publisher=United States Department of Justice | date=2008-03-07 | accessdate=2008-05-10| format=PDF}}</ref> Since 1997, Blagojevich's wife, Patricia, has made at least $38,000 acting as Rezko's real-estate agent on several of his company's property acquisitions. Rezko has reportedly raised millions of dollars for Blagojevich's campaigns and when Blagojevich won the Illinois gubernatorial election in 2002, Rezko assisted Blagojevich in setting up the state's first Democratic administration in twenty years.<ref name=Fund-raising/> Rezko recommended many of his business associates and their relatives for positions within the state government, three of which were appointed to the state board that oversees hospital projects and the state's development board was run by a former Rezko business associate. Rezko and Republican fundraiser Stuart Levine were charged in a 24-count federal indictment for allegedly using Rezko's influence with public officials to demand millions of dollars in kickbacks from companies that want to do business with the state.<ref name=Fund-raising/><ref name=salon/>  Levine pled guilty and served as the chief witness against Rezko at trial.

===Ties to Barack Obama===
In 1990, after Obama was elected president of the ''[[Harvard Law Review]]'', Rezmar Corp. offered him a job, which Obama turned down.  Obama did end up taking a job with law firm Davis, Miner, Barnhill & Galland,<ref>now Miner, Barnhill & Galland. {{cite news | url=http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-na-obamalegal6apr06,0,26672.story | title=Obama's lawyer days: brief and not all civil rights | work=Los Angeles Times | author=Morain, Dan | date=2008-04-06 | accessdate=2008-05-10}}</ref> which primarily worked civil rights cases, but also represented Rezmar and helped the company get more than $43&nbsp;million in government funding and whose former senior partner, Allison S.

Also, in 2005 Obama purchased a new home in the Kenwood District of Chicago for $1.65&nbsp;million ($300,000 below the original price) on the same day that Rezko's wife, Rita Rezko, purchased the adjoining empty lot from the same sellers for the full asking price.<ref name="Land deal">{{cite news | url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-0611010273nov01,0,1188525.story?page=1 | title=Rezko owns vacant lot next to Obama's home | work=Chicago Tribune | author=Ray Gibson | coauthors=David Jackson | date=2006-11-01 | accessdate=2008-03-04}}</ref> Obama acknowledged bringing his interest in the property to Rezko's attention,<ref>"Asked who approached her about the house, Schwan [the seller's broker] told Salon, 'I honestly don't remember.

After it had been reported in 2006 that Rezko was under federal investigation for influence-peddling, Obama purchased a {{convert|10|foot|m}} wide strip of Ms. Rezko's property for $104,500, $60,000 above the assessed value.<ref name="Land deal"/><ref name=Novak/> According to ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' columnist, Mark Brown, "Rezko definitely did Obama a favor by selling him the 10-foot strip of land, making his own parcel less attractive for development."<ref>{{cite news | author=Brown, Mark | url=http://www.suntimes.com/news/politics/121104,CST-NWS-brown02.article | title=Obama's dealings with Rezko buy a parcel of questions | work=Chicago Sun-Times | date=2006-11-02 | accessdate=2008-05-10}}</ref> Obama acknowledges that the exchange may have created the appearance of impropriety, and stated "I consider this a mistake on my part and I regret it."<ref name=mistake/>

On [[December 28]], [[2006]], Ms. Rezko sold the property to a company owned by her husband's former business attorney.

In June 2007, the ''Sun-Times'' published a story about letters Obama had written in 1997 to city and state officials in support of a low-income senior citizen development project headed by Rezko and partner Allison Davis. The project received more than $14&nbsp;million in taxpayer funds, including $885,000 in development fees for Rezko and Davis. Of Obama's letters in support of the Cottage View Terrace apartments development, Obama spokesman Bill Burton said, "This wasn't done as a favor for anyone, it was done in the interests of the people in the community who have benefited from the project. I don't know that anyone specifically asked him to write this letter nine years ago. There was a consensus in the community about the positive impact the project would make and Obama supported it because it was going to help people in his district." Rezko's attorney responded that "Mr. Rezko never spoke with, nor sought a letter from, Senator Obama in connection with that project.<ref>{{cite news | author=Novak, Tim | title=Obama's letters for Rezko | work=Chicago Sun-Times | date=2007-06-13 | url=http://www.suntimes.com/news/politics/425305,CST-NWS-obama13.article | accessdate=2008-05-10}}</ref>

=== Ties with other politicians ===
Tony Rezko's first significant political act was hosting a fundraiser for [[Harold Washington]] during Washington's successful campaign to become Chicago's first black mayor.<ref name=salon/> He has since raised funds for many other politicians, both Democrats and Republicans.<ref name=Sneed>{{cite news | author=Sneed, Michael | title=The Rezko scandal&nbsp;... | work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] | date=2006-10-12 | url=http://www.suntimes.com/news/sneed/93087,CST-NWS-sneed12.article | accessdate=2008-03-05}}</ref> In addition to Blagojevich and Obama, prominent Democrats that Rezko and his company, Rezmar, have contributed money to, or fund-raised for, are Comptroller [[Dan Hynes]], Attorney General [[Lisa Madigan]], Lieutenant Governor [[Pat Quinn (politician)|Pat Quinn]], former Chicago Mayors Daley and Washington, and former Cook County Board President [[John Stroger]].<ref name=Fund-raising/> Rezko has also raised money for Republicans: former Illinois Governors [[Jim Edgar]] and [[George Ryan]],<ref name=chicagomag/> the late Rosemont Mayor Don Stephens and he co-chaired a megamillion-dollar fund-raiser for President [[George W.
