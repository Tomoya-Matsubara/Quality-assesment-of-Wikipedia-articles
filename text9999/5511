The battle of the '''Falaise Pocket''', fought during the [[Second World War]] from 12&ndash;21 August 1944, was the decisive engagement of the [[Battle of Normandy]]. Taking its name from the area around the town of [[Falaise, Calvados|Falaise]] within which the German [[7th Army (Germany)|Seventh]] and [[5th Panzer Army (Germany)|Fifth Panzer]] Armies became encircled by the advancing [[Western Allies]], the battle is also referred to as the '''Falaise Gap''' after the corridor which the Germans sought to maintain to allow their escape.{{#tag:ref|The engagement is also sometimes referred to as the Chambois pocket, the Falaise-Chambois pocket, the Argentan-Falaise pocket,<ref name="Keegan">Keegan, p. 136</ref> or the Trun-Chanbois gap.<ref>Ellis, p. 448</ref>|group=nb}} The battle resulted in the destruction of the bulk of Germany's forces west of the River [[Seine]], and opened the way to Paris and the German border.

Following [[Operation Cobra]], the successful American breakout from the Normandy [[beachhead]], rapid advances were made to the south, the south-east, and into [[Brittany]]. Despite lacking the resources to cope with both the US penetration and simultaneous British and Canadian offensives around [[Caen]], Field Marshal [[G<U+00FC>nther von Kluge]], in overall command of German armed forces on the [[Western Front (WWII)|Western Front]], was not permitted by [[Adolf Hitler]] to withdraw; instead he was ordered to counterattack the Americans around [[Mortain]]. However, the remnants of four [[panzer division]]s, which was all that von Kluge could scrape together, were not strong enough to make any impression on the United States [[First United States Army|First Army]], and [[Operation L<U+00FC>ttich]] was a disaster that merely served to drive the Germans deeper into the Allied lines, leaving them in a highly dangerous position. Seizing the opportunity to envelop von Kluge's entire force, on 8 August the Allied ground forces commander Field Marshal [[Bernard Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Bernard Montgomery]] ordered his armies to converge on the Falaise&ndash;Chambois area. With the US First Army forming the southern arm, the British [[Second Army (United Kingdom)|Second Army]] the base, and the Canadian [[First Canadian Army|First Army]] the northern arm of the encirclement, the Germans fought hard to keep an escape route open, although their withdrawal did not begin until 17 August. On 19 August the Allies linked up in Chambois but in insufficient strength to completely seal the pocket. Gaps were forced in the Allied lines by desperate German assaults, the most significant and hard-fought being a corridor past elements of the Polish [[1st Armoured Division (Poland)|1st Armoured Division]], who had established a commanding position in the mouth of the pocket.

By the evening of 21 August the pocket was closed for the last time, with around 50,000 Germans still trapped inside. Although it is estimated that significant numbers managed to escape, German losses in both men and materiel were huge, and the Allies had achieved a decisive victory. Two days later Paris was [[Liberation of Paris|liberated]], and by 30 August the last German remnants had retreated across the Seine, effectively ending [[Operation Overlord]].

== Background ==

Early Allied objectives in the wake of the successful [[Operation Overlord|D-Day]] invasion of German-occupied France included both the [[deep water port]] of [[Cherbourg]] and the area surrounding the historic Normandy town of [[Caen]].<ref>Van der Vat, p. 110</ref> However, attempts to rapidly expand the Allied lodgement areas met fierce opposition, and adverse weather conditions in the English Channel delayed the build-up of supplies and reinforcements.<ref name="Williams114">Williams, p. 114</ref><ref>Greiss, pp. 308&ndash;310</ref> Cherbourg was able to hold out until 27 June, when it fell to the US VII Corps,<ref>Hastings, p. 165</ref> and Caen resisted a number of offensives until 20 July, when it was taken by the British and Canadians during Operations [[Operation Goodwood|Goodwood]] and [[Operation Atlantic|Atlantic]].<ref>Trew, p. 48</ref>  

The Allied ground forces commander, Field Marshal [[Bernard Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Bernard Montgomery]], had envisaged a theatre strategy of drawing German forces away from the US front to the British and Canadian sector, thus preparing the way for a US breakout.<ref>Hart, p.38</ref> On 25 July, while German attention was fixed firmly on the area around Caen, General [[Omar Bradley]] launched [[Operation Cobra]].<ref>Wilmot, pp. 390&ndash;392</ref> The [[First United States Army]] successfully ruptured the thin German lines screening Brittany,<ref>Hastings, p.257</ref> and by the end of the third day had advanced {{convert|15|mi|km}} south of its start line at several points.<ref>Wilmot, p. 393</ref> On 30 July [[Avranches]], at the base of the [[Cotentin Peninsula]], was captured;<ref>Williams, p. 185</ref> the German left flank was now wide open, and within 24 hours Patton's [[VIII Corps (United States)|VIII Corps]] swept across the bridge at [[Pontaubault]] into Brittany and continued south and west through open country, almost without opposition.<ref>Wilmot, p. 394</ref><ref>Hastings, p. 280</ref>

=== Operation L<U+00FC>ttich ===
{{main|Operation L<U+00FC>ttich}}

The US advance was extraordinarily rapid, and by 8 August the city of [[Le Mans]], the former headquarters of the German [[7th Army (Germany)|Seventh Army]], was in US hands.<ref>Williams, p. 194</ref> In the aftermath of Cobra and concurrent British and Canadian offensives, the German army in Normandy was reduced to such a poor condition that, as historian [[Max Hastings]] observes, "only a few SS fanatics still entertained hopes of avoiding defeat".<ref name=Hastings277>Hastings, p. 277</ref> In the east the [[Soviet Union]]'s summer offensive, [[Operation Bagration]], was underway, and with this cataclysm engulfing [[Army Group Centre]] there was no likelihood of reinforcements coming west.<ref name=Hastings277 /> However, instead of ordering his remaining forces in Normandy to withdraw to the [[Seine River]], [[Adolf Hitler]] sent a directive to [[Generalfeldmarschall]] G<U+00FC>nther von Kluge's [[Army Group B]] ordering "an immediate counterattack between Mortain and Avranches"<ref>D'Este, p. 414</ref> to "annihilate" the enemy and make contact with the west coast of the Cotentin peninsula.<ref name=Williams196>Williams, p. 196</ref> Hitler demanded that eight of von Kluge's nine available [[Panzer division]]s be used in the attack, but only four (one incomplete) could be relieved from their defensive duties and made ready in time.<ref name=Wilmot401>Wilmot, p. 401</ref> The German commanders protested that such an operation was beyond the reach of their resources,<ref name=Williams196 /> but these warnings were ignored and the counter-offensive, codenamed [[Operation L<U+00FC>ttich]], commenced on 7 August around Mortain.<ref>Hastings, p. 283</ref> Initially committed to the thrust were the [[2nd Panzer Division|2nd]], [[1st SS Panzer Division|1st SS ''Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler'']] and [[2nd SS Panzer Division Das Reich|2nd SS ''Das Reich'']] Panzer Divisions; they attacked with only 75 [[Panzer IV]]s, 70 [[Panther tank|Panthers]] and 32 [[self-propelled gun]]s between them.<ref>Hastings, p. 285</ref> Forewarned through [[ULTRA]] signals intercepts, the Allies were ready, and although fighting continued until 13 August Operation L<U+00FC>ttich was essentially over within 24 hours.<ref name="illustrated-ww2">Messenger, pp. 213&ndash;217</ref><ref>Bennett 1979, pp. 112-119.</ref><ref>Hastings, p. 286</ref> Instead of relieving the German predicament, the Mortain counterattack had driven them deeper into the Allied embrace,<ref>Hastings, p. 335</ref> and with the most formidable of von Kluge's remaining forces now destroyed by the US First Army the entire Normandy front was left teetering on the verge of collapse&mdash;a possibility anticipated by Allied command.<ref name=Williams197 /> Bradley declared: "This is an opportunity that comes to a commander not more than once in a century. We're about to destroy an entire hostile army and go all the way from here to the German border".<ref name=Williams197>Williams, p. 197</ref>

=== Operation Totalize ===

[[Image:Totalise88gun.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Cromwell tank]] and [[Willys MB|jeep]] pass an abandoned German [[8.8 cm PaK 43|88mm anti-tank gun]] during Totalize.]]
To precipitate the German collapse and menace the escape route of the forces fighting the British and Americans further west, the high ground north of the town of Falaise became the target of First Canadian Army.<ref>D'Este, p. 404</ref> General [[Harry Crerar]], commanding the newly inaugurated army, and [[Lieutenant-General]] [[Guy Simonds]] of [[II Canadian Corps|II&nbsp;Canadian Corps]], planned an Anglo-Canadian offensive code-named [[Operation Totalize]].<ref name=Hastings296>Hastings, p. 296</ref> This relied on accurate preparation by heavy bombers and an innovative night attack using [[Kangaroo (armoured personnel carrier)|Kangaroo armoured personnel carriers]].<ref>Zuehlke, p. 168</ref> Preceded by a massive aerial bombardment by [[RAF Bomber Command]], Totalize was launched on the night of 7 August; 76 converted self-propelled gun platforms transported the lead infantry, guided by electronic aids and illuminants.<ref name=Hastings296 /> Fighting to hold the {{convert|14|km|mi|adj=on}} front was [[Kurt Meyer (Panzermeyer)|Kurt Meyer]]'s [[12th SS Panzer Division|12th SS Panzer Division ''Hitlerjugend'']], supported by tanks from the [[101 SS Heavy Panzer Battalion|SS Heavy Panzer Battalion 101]] and the remnants of the 89th Infantry Division.<ref>Williams, p. 198</ref> Despite initial gains on [[Battle of Verri<U+00E8>res Ridge|Verri<U+00E8>res Ridge]] and near [[Cintheaux]], on 9 August the momentum of the assault slowed;<ref>Hastings, p. 299</ref> strong German resistance and poor Canadian unit leadership and fighting power resulted in heavy casualties for both the [[4th Canadian (Armoured) Division|4th Canadian]] and [[1st Armoured Division (Poland)|1st Polish]] Armoured Divisions.<ref name=Hastings301/><ref name="Bercuson 230">Bercuson, p. 230</ref> By 10 August, Anglo-Canadian forces had reached Hill 195 north of Falaise, but were unable to get into the town.<ref name="Bercuson 230" /> The following day Simonds pulled his battered armoured divisions out of the line and relieved them with infantry formations, ending the offensive.<ref>Hastings, p. 300</ref>

== Battle ==

Still expecting von Kluge to withdraw his forces from the tightening Allied noose, Montgomery had for some time been planning a "long envelopment", by which the British and Canadians would pivot left from Falaise towards the River Seine while the US Third Army blocked the escape route between the Seine and Loire rivers, trapping all surviving German forces in western France.<ref name=Hastings353>Hastings, p. 353</ref> However, in a telephone conversation on 8 August, the [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force|Supreme Allied Commander]] General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] recommended an American proposal for a shorter envelopment centred around [[Argentan]]. Although Montgomery acknowledged the possibilities, both he and Patton had misgivings; if the Allies did not take Argentan, [[Alen<U+00E7>on]], and Falaise quickly, a large proportion of von Kluge's force might escape. Believing he could always fall back on the original plan if necessary, Montgomery gave in to Bradley's enthusiastic urging and the American proposal was adopted.<ref name=Hastings353 />

=== Initial thrust ===
{{see|Operation Tractable}}

Patton's Third Army, moving up from the south to form one arm of the encirclement, made good initial progress. On 12 August Alen<U+00E7>on was captured, and despite von Kluge's commitment of a force he had been trying to gather for a counterattack, the next day Major General [[Wade H. Haislip]]'s XV Corps advanced {{convert|35|mi|km}} and strongly established itself around Argentan, although the town itself remained in German hands.<ref name=Wilmot417>Wilmot, p. 417</ref> Concerned that American troops would clash with the British, who were advancing from the north-west, Bradley over-rode Patton's orders for a further push north towards Falaise and halted Haislip's corps.<ref name=Wilmot417 />
[[Image:Operation Tractable.png|thumb|left|The formation of the Falaise Pocket, from 8&ndash;17 August 1944.]]
With the Americans on the southern flank heavily engaged with [[Panzer Group Eberbach]] and the British pressing in from the north-west, it fell to the Canadian First Army to close the trap.<ref name=Wilmot419>Wilmot, p. 419</ref> Save for a limited operation by the [[2nd Canadian Infantry Division]] down the Laize valley on 12 and 13 August, most of the days following Totalize were spent preparing a major set-piece attack on Falaise, codenamed [[Operation Tractable]].<ref name=Hastings301>Hastings, p. 301</ref> Tractable commenced at 11:42 on the morning of 14 August, covered by an artillery-delivered [[smokescreen]] that mimicked the darkness of Operation Totalize.<ref name=Bercuson231>Bercuson, p. 231</ref><ref name=Hastings301 /> A series of attacks by the 4th Canadian and 1st Polish Armoured Divisions forced a passage over the Laison River, but limited access to the crossing points over the [[Dives River]] facilitated counterattacks by the German [[102 SS Heavy Panzer Battalion|SS Heavy Panzer Battalion 102]].<ref name=Bercuson231 /> Mainly due to navigation difficulties and poor coordination between the ground and air forces,{{#tag:ref|Some Canadian ground forces were using yellow smoke markers to identify their positions, while RAF Bomber Command was using the same colour markers to identify its targets.<ref>Hastings, p. 354</ref>|group=nb}} the first day's progress was slower than expected.<ref name=Hastings302>Hastings, p. 302</ref>

On 15 August the 2nd and [[3rd Canadian Infantry Division|3rd Canadian Infantry]] Divisions, with the support of the [[2nd Canadian (Armoured) Brigade]], renewed their drive south,<ref name=vandervat169>Van Der Vat, p. 169</ref> but progress remained slow.<ref name=Hastings302 /> After harsh fighting and having weathered several German counter-attacks, the 4th Armoured Division captured [[Soulangy]], although strong German resistance prevented an outright breakthrough to [[Trun, Orne|Trun]] and the day's gains were minimal.<ref name="Bercuson 232"> Bercuson, p. 232</ref> However, the following day the 2nd Canadian Infantry Division broke into Falaise itself, encountering minor opposition from [[Waffen SS]] units and scattered pockets of German infantry, and by 17 August had secured the town.<ref name=Copp104>Copp (2006), p. 104</ref> 

At midday on the 16 August, von Kluge had declined Hitler's demand for another counterattack, declaring it was utterly impossible.<ref name=Hastings302 /> A withdrawal was at last authorized later that afternoon, but believing von Kluge intended to surrender to the Allies,<ref name=Wilmot420>Wilmot, p. 420</ref> on the evening of the 17 August Hitler relieved him of command and recalled him to Germany; von Kluge committed suicide en route.<ref name=Hastings303 /> He was succeeded by Field Marshal [[Walter Model]], whose first act was to order the immediate retreat of the Seventh Army and Fifth Panzer Army, while [[II SS Panzer Corps]] (composed of the remnants of four panzer divisions) held the north of the escape route against the British and Canadians and [[XLVII Panzer Corps (Germany)|XLVII Panzer Corps]] (the remnants of two panzer divisions) held the south against the Americans.<ref name=Hastings303 />

For the Allies time was the critical factor in blocking the German army's escape, but with the Americans held at Argentan and the Canadian advance towards Trun proceeding slowly, by 17 August the encirclement was still incomplete.<ref name=Hastings303>Hastings, p. 303</ref> General [[Stanis<U+0142>aw Maczek]]'s Polish 1st Armoured Division (part of the First Canadian Army) was broken into four battle groups and ordered to make a wide sweep to the south-east to join up with the Americans at Chambois;<ref name=Hastings303 /> Trun fell to the Canadian 4th Armoured Division on 18 August.<ref name="Zuehlke 169"> Zuehlke, p. 169</ref> Having captured [[Champeaux, Manche|Champeaux]], on 19 August all four Polish battle groups converged on Chambois; reinforced by the 4th Armoured, by the evening the Poles had secured the town and linked up with the US 90th and French [[2nd Armored Division (France)|2nd Armoured]] Divisions.<ref name=Jarymowycz192>Jarymowycz, p. 192</ref><ref name=Hastings304>Hastings, p. 304</ref><ref name=Wilmot422 /> However, although the arms of the encirclement were now in contact, the Allies were not yet astride Seventh Army's escape route in any great strength and their positions came under frenzied assault.<ref name=Hastings304 /> During the day an armoured column from the 2nd Panzer Division broke through the Canadians in [[Saint-Lambert, Calvados|St. Lambert]], taking half the village and keeping a road open for six hours until it was closed again towards nightfall.<ref name=Wilmot422 /> Many Germans escaped along this route, and numerous small parties infiltrated through to the Dives during the night.<ref name=Wilmot423>Wilmot, p.423</ref>

Having taken Chambois, two of the four Polish battlegroups drove north-east and established themselves on [[Hill 262]] (Mont Ormel), spending the night of 19 August entrenching the lines of approach to the hill.<ref name="deste 456">D'Este, p. 456</ref> The following morning Field Marshal Model renewed his attempts to force open an egress, ordering elements of the [[2nd SS Panzer Division Das Reich|2nd]] and [[9th SS Panzer Division Hohenstaufen|9th]] SS Panzer Divisions to attack from outside the pocket towards the Polish positions on Hill 262.<ref name="Jarymowycz195"> Jarymowycz, p. 195</ref> Around midday several units of the [[10th SS Panzer Division Frundsberg|10th SS]], [[12th SS Panzer Division|12th SS]], and [[116th Panzer Division|116th]] Panzer Divisions managed to break through the weak Polish lines and open a corridor, while the 9th SS Panzer Division prevented the Canadians from intervening.<ref name="Jarymowycz196">Jarymowycz, p. 196</ref> By mid afternoon about 10,000 German troops had passed out of the pocket.<ref name="Van-Der-Vat 168" />

[[Image:Polish hill 262.jpg|thumb|left|Polish Infantry moving towards cover on [[Hill 262|Mont Ormel]], 20 August 1944.]]Despite being isolated and coming under further strong attacks the Poles clung on to Mont Ormel, which they referred to as "The Mace". Although they lacked the fighting power to close the corridor, they were able from their vantage point to direct artillery fire on to the retreating Germans, exacting a deadly toll.<ref name="D'Este 458"> D'Este, p. 458</ref> Exasperated by the losses to his men, Colonel General [[Paul Hausser]]&mdash;commanding the Seventh Army&mdash;ordered the Polish positions to be "eliminated".<ref name="Van-Der-Vat 168">Van Der Vat, p. 168</ref> Substantial forces, including the remnants of the [[352nd Infantry Division (Germany)|352nd Infantry Division]] and several battle groups from the 2nd SS Panzer Division, inflicted heavy casualties on the 8th and 9th Battalions of the Polish 1st Armoured Division, but the assault was eventually beaten off.

After the brutality of the day's combat nightfall was welcomed by both sides. With contact being avoided, fighting during the night was sporadic, although the Poles continued to call down frequent artillery strikes to disrupt the ongoing German retreat from the sector.<ref name="D'Este 458" /> 

Although not as coordinated as previously, German attacks on Hill 262 resumed the following morning.<ref name="montormel 74">{{cite web |url=http://montormel.evl.pl/?id=74 |title=The End of the German 7th Army |publisher=Memorial Mont-Ormel |accessdate=2008-06-13 }}</ref> The Polish position came close to being overrun, and in repelling the Germans the tanks were forced to use the last of their ammunition.<ref name="montormel 74" /> At approximately 12:00 noon the final attempt on the positions of the 9th Battalion was launched by the last SS remnants, which was defeated at close quarters. Surrounded for three days and under almost constant attack, the Polish casualties for the Battle of Mont Ormel were 325 killed, 1,002 wounded, and 114 missing&mdash;approximately 20 percent of the Polish 1st Armoured Division's combat strength.<ref name=Jarymowycz196 /> Within the hour, the [[The Canadian Grenadier Guards|Canadian Grenadier Guards]] had reached what remained of Mont Ormel's defenders,<ref name="Bercuson 232"/> and by late afternoon the remainder of the 2nd and 9th SS Panzer Divisions had begun their retreat to the Seine.<ref name="Bercuson 233"/>

Disappointed that a significant portion of Seventh Army had eluded them, many in the Allied higher echelons&mdash;particularly among the Americans&mdash;were bitterly critical of what they perceived as Montgomery's lack of urgency in closing the pocket.<ref name="Wilmot242" /> Some historians agree that the gap could have been closed earlier; Wilmot notes that despite having British divisions in reserve Montgomery did not reinforce Simonds, and neither was the Canadian drive on Trun and Chambois as "vigorous and venturesome" as the situation demanded.<ref name="Wilmot242" /> Hastings writes that Montgomery, having witnessed what he characterises as a poor Canadian performance during Totalize, should have brought up veteran British divisions to take the lead.<ref name="Hastings353" /> However, while acknowledging that Montgomery and Crerar might have done more to impart momentum to the British and Canadians, these and others such as D'Este and Blumenson dismiss as "absurd over-simplification" Patton's post-battle claim that the Americans could have prevented the German escape had Bradley not ordered him to stop at Argentan.<ref name="Hastings369"> Hastings, p. 369</ref> Patton's troops did not take Argentan until 20 August&mdash;the day after the Poles and Canadians captured Chambois&mdash;and the American unit that closed the gap between Argentan and Chambois, the [[90th Sustainment Brigade (United States)|90th Division]], was according to Hastings one of the least effective of any Allied army in Normandy. He speculates that the real reason Bradley halted Patton was not fears over accidental clashes with the British but an appreciation that with powerful German formations still effective at that stage of the battle, the Americans lacked the means to defend an early blocking position and would have suffered an "embarrassing and gratuitous setback" at the hands of the retreating ''[[Fallschirmj<U+00E4>ger]]'' and 2nd and 12th SS Panzer Divisions.<ref name="Hastings369" />

The battle of the Falaise Pocket marked the closing phase of the Battle of Normandy with a decisive German defeat.<ref name=Williams204 /> Hitler's personal involvement had been damaging from the first, with his insistence on hopelessly optimistic counter-offensives, his micro-management of his generals, and his refusal to countenance a withdrawal when his armies were threatened with annihilation.<ref name=Williams205>Williams, p. 205</ref> More than 40 German divisions were destroyed during the Battle of Normandy, while 450,000 men had been lost, of whom 240,000 were killed or wounded.<ref name=Williams205 /> The Allies had achieved this at a cost of 209,672 casualties, including 36,976 killed.<ref name=Hastings313 /> The final battle of Operation Overlord&mdash;the [[Liberation of Paris]]&mdash;followed on 25 August, and Overlord reached its effective end by 30 August with the retreat of the last German unit across the Seine.<ref>Hastings, p. 319</ref>
