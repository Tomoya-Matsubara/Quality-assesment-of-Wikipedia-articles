'''Mamre''' ({{lang-he-n|<U+05DE><U+05B7><U+05DE><U+05B0><U+05E8><U+05B5><U+05D0>}}), full Hebrew name ''Elonei Mamre'' ("Oaks/Terebinths of Mamre"), refers to a [[Canaan]]ite [[cult]]ic [[shrine]] dedicated to the supreme, sky god of the Canaanite [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]], [[El (god)|''El'']].<ref>The king-priest [[Melchizedek]], king of [[Jerusalem|Salem]] and priest of (''El <U+02BF>Elyon'') greets Abraham with bread and wine on his victorious return from battle (''Genesis'', 14:18-20), located at the modern ''Ramat al-Khalil''. ''El'' here is the Canaanite sky god, while ''Elyon'' is a distinct deity in what is a compound name. But in [[Hebrew]], the two words meant 'God the Most High'</ref> [[Talmud]]ic sources refer to the site as ''Beth Ilanim'' or ''Botnah''. it was one of the three most important "fairs", market place or [[caravanserai]], in [[Palestine]]. It lies approximately half way between [[Halhul]] and [[Hebron]], (heading north from Hebron to Halhul at the intersection of the Halhul/Hebron road and the 3507, one turns right on to the 3507 towards [[Jericho]] [away from [[Bayt Jibrin]]] and Mamre is to be found some 500 yards further down, on the left).

[[Bronze age]] pottery shards found at the site may indicate that the cultic shrine was in use from 2600-2000 BCE.<ref name="JETCHP"/> Mamre, in the [[Bible|biblical]] account, was the site where [[Abraham]] came to set up his tents to camp, built an [[altar]],<ref>''Genesis', 13:18</ref> and was brought divine tidings, in the guise of three angels, of [[Sarah]]'s pregnancy, <ref>Gen.18:1-15</ref> while elsewhere<ref>''Genesis'' 14:13</ref> it is called 'the [[Terebinth]]s of Mamre the [[Amorite]]'.<ref>Robert Alter, (tr.)

The Herodian structure was destroyed by [[Bar Kochba]]'s army, only to be rebuilt by the [[Roman Emperor]] [[Hadrian]]. Hadrian revived the fair, which had long been an important one as it took place at an intersection forming the transport and communications nub of transport of the southern [[Judea|Judaean]] mountains. This ''mercatus'' (Heb.''yerid'' or ''shuq'': Gk. ''paneguris'')  or fair/market, was one of the sites chosen by [[Hadrian]] to sell remnants of Bar Kochba's defeated army into [[slavery]].

== Rabbinical tradition ==
Due to the pagan [[idolatry|idolatrous]] nature of the rituals at the fair, Jews were forbidden to participate by their [[rabbi]]s.<ref name="ZS ERP">Safrai, Zeev (1994) ''The Economy of Roman Palestine'', Routledge, ISBN 041510243X p 254</ref><ref>Recent Jewish settlers in the area protest that there was right, now apparently revoked, to visit and worship the site, which they now claim to be a shrine.

According to the [[Jerusalem Talmud]]:
 
:<blockquote>'They prohibited a fair only in the case of one of the character of that at Botnah. And it has been taught along these same lines in a [[Tannaitic]] tradition. There are three fairs, the fair at [[Gaza]], the fair at [[Acre]], and the fair at Botnah, and the most debased of the lot of them is the fair of Botnah.' <ref> Rabbi [[Yohanan]] in the ''Avodah Zarah'', 1:4,39d,  cf.Jacob Neusner  (tr. & ed.) ''Abodah Zarah: A Preliminary Translation and Explanation,'University of Chicago Press, 1982 pp.29-30; Ben-Zion Rosenfield, Joseph Menirav, Chava Cassel,''Markets and Marketing in Roman Palestine,'' Brill, 2005 ISBN 9004140492, p.63
</ref></blockquote>

== Under Christianity ==
Notwithstanding the rabbinic ban, by the time of [[Constantine I of the Roman Empire|Constantine]]'s reign the market had become an informal interdenominational festival, in addition to its functions as a trade fair, frequented by Christians, Jews and [[pagan]]s. The cultic shrine was made over for Christian use after [[Eutropia]], Constantine's mother-in-law, visited it and was scandalised by its pagan character. The drawing of the site after the excavation of the German scholar A E Mader from 1926-1928, shows the Basilica and stores furthest from the ''Haram Ramet el-Khalil'', a well altar and tree, with the market place occupying the central enclosure.<ref>Safrai, Zeev (1994) ''The Economy of Roman Palestine'', Routledge, ISBN 041510243X p 249</ref><ref>Netzer, Ehud and Laureys-Chachy, Rachel (2006) ''The Architecture of Herod, the Great Builder'' Mohr Siebeck, ISBN 316148570X p 231</ref> Constantine ordered the ''comes'' Acacius to destroy all pagan idols and banned the pagan practises.<ref>''Life of Constantine'' By Eusebius, Translated by Averil Cameron, Stuart George Hall Oxford University Press, (1999) ISBN 0198149174 p 301</ref> The enclosure was then consecrated, Constantine had the [[Basilica]] built, dedicated to [[St George]] and the enclosure of [[Terebinth]] of Mamre roofed over, the foundations of which are still visible.<ref name="ZS ERP"/><ref>Fergusson, James (2004) ''Tree and Serpent Worship Or Illustrations of Mythology and Arts in India: In the 1st and 4th Century After Christ'' Asian Educational Services, ISBN 8120612361 p 7</ref> The venerated tree was destroyed by Christian visitors taking souvenirs, leaving only a stump which survived down to the seventh century.<ref name="JETCHP">Taylor, Joan E.

::<blockquote>'The place is presently called the Terebinth, and is situated at the distance of fifteen stadia from Hebron, . . There every year a very famous festival is held in the summer time, by people of the neighbourhood as well as by the inhabitants of more distant parts of [[Palestine]] and by [[Phoenicia]]ns and [[Arabia Petraea|Arabian]]s. Very many come there for the sake of business, some to sell and some to buy. The feast is celebrated by a very big congregation of Jews, since they boast of Abraham as their forefather, of heathens since angels came there, of Christians since he who should be born from the Virgin for the salvation of humankind appeared there to that pious man. Everyone venerates this place according to his religion: some praying God the ruler of all, some calling upon the angels and offering libations of wine, burning incense or sacrificing an ox, a goat, a sheep or a cock... Constantine's mother in law (Euthropia), having come there to fulfill a vow, gave notice of all this to the Emperor. So he wrote to the bishops of Palestine reproaching them for having forgot their mission and permitted such a most holy place to be defiled by those [[libation]]s and sacrifices.'<ref>Frazer, James George (2003) Folklore in the Old Testament Studies in Comparative Religion Legend and Law: Studies in Comparative Religion, Legend, and Law Kessinger Publishing, ISBN 0766132382 p 336</ref></blockquote>
