The '''Washington Metro''', officially '''Metrorail''', and commonly called '''Metro''', is the [[rapid transit]] system in [[Washington, D.C.]], [[United States]], and its surrounding suburbs. It is administered by the [[Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority]] (WMATA), which also operates [[Metrobus (Washington, D.C.)|Metrobus]] service under the Metro name.<ref>[[Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority]], [http://www.wmata.com/about_metro/faqs.cfm#build Frequently Asked Questions], accessed July 2009: "What do I need to know to build near Metro property? Metro reviews designs and monitors construction of projects adjacent to Metrorail and Metrobus property..."</ref> In Maryland, Metro provides service to [[Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery County]] and [[Prince George's County, Maryland|Prince George's County]]; in Virginia, to [[Fairfax County, Virginia|Fairfax County]], [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington County]], and the [[Alexandria, Virginia|City of Alexandria]]. Since opening in 1976, the network has grown to include five lines, 86 stations, and {{convert|106.3|mi|km}} of track.<ref name="wmatafacts">{{cite web|url=http://www.wmata.com/about_metro/docs/metrofacts.pdf|title=WMATA Facts|month=July|year=2009|publisher=WMATA|accessdate=2010-03-18}}</ref>

Metro stations were designed by Chicago architect [[Harry Weese]], and are examples of late-20th century [[modern architecture]]. With their heavy use of exposed [[concrete]] and repetitive design motifs, Metro stations also display aspects of [[Brutalist architecture|brutalist]] design. In 2007, the design of the Metro's vaulted-ceiling stations was voted number 106 on the [[American Institute of Architects]]' list of "[[List of America's Favorite Architecture according to the AIA|America's Favorite Architecture]]".

[[Image:DCSubwayConstruction.jpg|thumb|left|Metro under construction at the Navy Yard in 1989]]
During the 1960s, there were plans for a massive freeway system in Washington, but [[Freeway and expressway revolts|opposition]] to this freeway system grew. [[Harland Bartholomew]], who chaired the [[National Capital Planning Commission]], thought that a rail transit system would never be self-sufficient because of low density land uses and general transit ridership decline.<ref name="Bartholomew Contributions">{{cite web

The Beltway received full funding; funding for the ambitious Inner Loop Freeway system was partially reallocated toward construction of the Metro system.<ref>{{cite book |author=Schrag, Zachary |title=The Great Society Subway: A History of the Washington Metro |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |year=2006 |isbn= ISBN 0-8018-8246-X}}</ref>

WMATA approved plans for a {{convert|98|mi|km|sing=on}} regional system in 1968,<ref name="Building Metro - Planning pg2"/> and construction began in 1969, with groundbreaking on December 9. The system opened March 27, 1976, with {{mi to km|4.6|abbr=no}} available on the Red Line with five stations from Rhode Island Avenue to Farragut North, all in the District of Columbia. Arlington County, Virginia was linked to the system on July 1, 1976; Montgomery County, Maryland on February 6, 1978; Prince George's County, Maryland on November 20, 1978; and Fairfax County, Virginia and Alexandria, Virginia on December 17, 1983.<ref name="WMATA History"/>

The {{convert|103|mi|km|sing=on}}, 83-station system was completed with the opening of the Green Line segment to Branch Avenue on January 13, 2001. This did not mean the end of the growth of the system: a {{convert|3.22|mi|km|sing=on}} extension of the Blue Line to [[Largo Town Center (WMATA station)|Largo Town Center]] and [[Morgan Boulevard (WMATA station)|Morgan Boulevard]] opened on December 18, 2004.

Metro construction required billions of federal dollars, originally provided by Congress under the authority of the National Capital Transportation Act of 1969 (Public Law 91-143). The cost was paid with 90% federal money and 10% local money. This act was amended on January 3, 1980 by Public Law 96-184, "The National Capital Transportation Amendment of 1979" (also known as the Stark-Harris Act), which authorized additional funding of $1.7 billion to permit the completion of {{convert|89.5|mi|km}} of the system as provided under the terms of a full funding grant agreement executed with WMATA in July 1986, which required 25% to be paid from local funds. On November 15, 1990, [http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c101:H.R.1463: Public Law 101-551], "The National Capital Transportation Amendments of 1990", authorized an additional $1.3 billion in federal funds for construction of the remaining {{convert|13.5|mi|km}} of the {{convert|103|mi|km|adj=on}} system, completed via the execution of full funding grant agreements, with a 63% federal/37% local matching.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fta.dot.gov/funding/data/grants_financing_1115.html|title=Washington, DC Metrorail Construction|accessdate=17 December 2008|work=www.fta.dot.gov|publisher=[[Federal Transit Administration]]}}</ref>

In February 2006, Metro officials chose Randi Miller, a car dealership employee from [[Woodbridge, Virginia]], to record new "doors opening", "doors closing", and "please stand clear of the doors, thank you" announcements after winning an open contest to replace the messages recorded by Sandy Carroll in 1996.

Since opening in 1976, the Metro network has grown to include five lines, 86 stations, and {{convert|106.3|mi|km}} of track.<ref name="wmatafacts" /> The rail network is designed according to a [[spoke-hub distribution paradigm]], with rail lines running between downtown Washington and its nearby suburbs. The system makes extensive use of interlining&nbsp;<U+2013> running more than one service on the same track. There are five operating lines and one line under construction:<ref name="wmatafacts" /><ref name="dulles_metro_construction">{{cite web|url=http://www.dullesmetro.com/construction/index.cfm|title=Construction|publisher=Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority|accessdate=2009-04-21}}</ref>

{{Washington Metro Lines Detail}}

There are 40 stations in the District of Columbia, 15 in Prince George's County, 11 in Montgomery County, 11 in Arlington County, six in Fairfax County, and three in the City of Alexandria.<ref name="wmatafacts" /> The [[Silver Line (Washington Metro)|Silver Line]] will add 11 new stations, eight in Fairfax County and three in [[Loudoun County, Virginia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dullesmetro.com/about/index.cfm|title=Dulles Metrorail Project Overview|publisher=Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority|accessdate=2009-01-28}}</ref>

About {{convert|50|mi|km}} of Metro's track is underground, as are 47 of the 86 stations. Track runs underground mostly within the District and high-density suburbs. Surface track accounts for about {{convert|46|mi|km}} of the total, and aerial track makes up {{convert|9|mi|km}}.<ref name="wmatafacts" /> At {{convert|196|ft|m}} below the surface, the [[Forest Glen (WMATA station)|Forest Glen]] station on the Red Line is the deepest in the system. There are no escalators; high-speed elevators take 20 seconds to travel from the street to the station platform. The [[Wheaton (WMATA station)|Wheaton]] station, next to Forest Glen station on the Red Line, has the second-longest continuous escalator in the world, the longest in the [[Western Hemisphere]], at {{convert|230|ft|m}}.<ref name="wmatafacts" /> The [[Rosslyn (WMATA station)|Rosslyn]] station is the deepest station on the Orange/Blue Line, at {{convert|97|ft|m}} below street level. The station features the third-longest continuous escalator in the world at {{convert|205|ft|m}}; an escalator ride between the street level and the mezzanine level takes nearly two minutes.<ref>{{cite journal|month=Summer|year=2006|title=Discover A New Horizon|journal=Rosslyn Magazine|volume=1|issue=2|page=21}}</ref>

The system is not centered on any single station, but [[Metro Center (WMATA station)|Metro Center]] is at the intersection of the Red, Orange and Blue Lines, the three busiest lines.<ref name=2008guide>{{cite web|url=http://www.wmata.com/about_metro/docs/media_guide_2008.pdf|title=Media Guide 2008|publisher=WMATA|accessdate=2009-01-28}}</ref> The station is also the location of WMATA's main sales office. Metro has designated five other "core stations" that have high passenger volume, including:<ref name=corestations>{{cite web|url=http://www.wmata.com/pdfs/planning/Demand_Passenger%20Facilities.pdf|title=Core Stations Capacity Enhancements|date=October 21, 2008|publisher=WMATA|accessdate=2009-01-28}}</ref> [[Gallery Place <U+2013> Chinatown (WMATA station)|Gallery Place <U+2013> Chinatown]], transfer station for the Red, Green and Yellow Lines; [[L'Enfant Plaza (WMATA station)|L'Enfant Plaza]], transfer station for the Orange, Blue, Green and Yellow Lines; [[Union Station (WMATA station)|Union Station]], the busiest station by passenger boardings;<ref name=2008guide /> [[Farragut North (WMATA station)|Farragut North]]; and [[Farragut West (WMATA station)|Farragut West]]. In order to deal with the high number of passengers in transfer stations, Metro is studying the possibility of building pedestrian connections between nearby core transfer stations. For example, a {{convert|750|ft|m|adj=on}} passage between Metro Center and Gallery Place stations would allow passengers to transfer between the Orange/Blue and Yellow/Green Lines without going one stop on the Red Line. Another tunnel between Farragut West and Farragut North stations would allow transfers between the Red and Orange/Blue lines, decreasing transfer demand at Metro Center by an estimated 11%.<ref name=corestations />

Metro runs special service patterns on holidays and when events in Washington may require additional service. [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] activities require Metro to adjust service in order to provide extra capacity to and from the [[National Mall]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wmata.com/about_metro/board_of_directors/board_docs/061605_IVBJuly4OperationsPlan.pdf|title=July 4th, 2005 Operations Plan|date=June 16, 2005|publisher=WMATA|accessdate=2009-01-28}}</ref> WMATA makes similar adjustments during other events, such as [[United States presidential inauguration|presidential inaugurations]].

The 7000 series of cars, currently in development, are planned to go into service beginning in 2012. The new cars will be different from previous models in that they will operate as quads instead of pairs.

=== Signaling and operation ===
{{Main|Washington Metro signaling and operation}}
During normal passenger operation on revenue tracks, trains are controlled by an integrated [[Automatic Train Operation]] and [[Automatic Train Control]] system that accelerates and brakes the trains automatically without operator intervention. However, all trains are manned with train operators who close the doors (they can be set to open automatically), make station announcements, and supervise their trains. The operator can manually operate a train when necessary.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wmata.com/about_metro/board_of_directors/board_docs/033105_Rev3033005PrecisionStopping.pdf|title=Precision Station Stopping Progress Update|date=March 21, 2005|publisher=WMATA|accessdate=2009-01-27}}</ref> Since June 2009, all Metro trains have been under manual operation.<ref name="Manual">{{cite news|last=Hohmann|first=James|title=After Fatal Crash, Metro Still Wary Of Letting Computers Control Trains|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/08/18/AR2009081802446.html|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=2009-08-19}}</ref>

Metro planners designed the system with passenger safety and order maintenance as primary considerations. The open vaulted ceiling design of stations and the limited obstructions on platforms allow few opportunities to conceal criminal activity. Station platforms are built away from station walls to limit vandalism and provide for diffused lighting of the station from recessed lights. Metro's attempts to reduce crime, combined with how the station environments were designed with [[Crime prevention through environmental design|crime prevention]] in mind,<ref name="lavigne">{{cite journal|title=Visibility and Vigilance: Metro's Situational Approach to Preventing Subway Crime (Research in Brief) |publisher=National Institute of Justice, U.S. Department of Justice |url=http://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles/166372.pdf |author=La Vigne, Nancy G. |year=1997 |month=November |format=PDF}}</ref> has contributed to Metro being among the safest and cleanest subway systems in the United States.<ref name="lavigne2">{{cite book|title=Preventing Mass Transit Crime |chapter=Safe Transport: Security by Design on the Washington Metro (Chapter 6) |publisher=Criminal Justice Press |editor = Clarke, Ronald V.

Metro is patrolled by its own police force, which is charged with ensuring the safety of passengers and employees. Transit Police officers patrol the Metro system and [[Metrobus (Washington, D.C.)|Metrobuses]], and they have jurisdiction and arrest powers throughout the {{convert|1500|sqmi|km2|adj=on}} Metro service area for crimes that occur on or against transit authority facilities, or within {{convert|150|ft|m}} of a Metrobus stop. The Metro Transit Police Department is the only U.S. police agency that has local police authority in three different "state"-level jurisdictions (Maryland, Virginia, and the District of Columbia).<ref name="Metro Police">{{cite web

Each city and county in the Metro service area has similar ordinances that regulate or prohibit vending on Metro-owned property, and which prohibit riders from eating, drinking, or smoking in Metro trains, buses, and stations; the Transit Police have a reputation for enforcing these laws rigorously.

=== Random bag searches ===
On October 27, 2008, the [[Metro Transit Police Department]] announced plans to immediately begin random searches of backpacks, purses, and other bags.

== Accidents ==
{{Main|Incidents on the Washington Metro}}
Several collisions have occurred on Washington Metro, resulting in injuries and fatalities, along with numerous derailments with few or no injuries. WMATA has been criticized for disregarding safety warnings and advice from experts.  The Tri-State Oversight Committee oversees WMATA, but has no regulatory authority.  Metro's safety department is usually in charge of investigating incidents, but cannot require other Metro departments to implement its recommendations.<ref name="safetywarnings">{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/05/AR2005060500968.html |title=Safety Warnings Often Ignored at Metro |work=The Washington Post |date=2005-06-06 |last=Becker |first=Jo |coauthors=Lyndsey Layton |accessdate=2009-06-25}}</ref>

During the [[Blizzard of 1996]], on January 6, a Metro operator was killed when a train failed to stop at the [[Shady Grove (WMATA station)|Shady Grove]] station. The four-car train overran the station platform and struck an unoccupied train that was awaiting assignment. The [[National Transportation Safety Board]] (NTSB) investigation found that the crash was a result of a failure in the train's computer-controlled braking system. The NTSB recommended that Metro grant train operators the ability to manually control the braking system, even in inclement weather, and recommended that Metro prohibit parked rail cars on tracks used by inbound trains.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ntsb.gov/publictn/1996/rar9604.pdf|title=Railroad Accident Report: Collision of Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority Train T-111 with Standing Train at Shady Grove Passenger Station, Gaithersburg, Maryland, January 6, 1996|date=1996-10-29|publisher=National Transportation Safety Board|accessdate=2009-01-27}}</ref>

==== Derailments ====
[[Image:WMATA CAF 5152 derailment.jpg|thumb|right|alt=The crushed end of a subway car.|Green Line train following the January 7, 2007 derailment]]
On January 13, 1982, a [[1982 Washington Metro train derailment|train derailed]] at a malfunctioning crossover switch south of the [[Federal Triangle (WMATA station)|Federal Triangle]] station. In attempting to restore the train to the rails, supervisors failed to notice that another car had also derailed. The other rail car slid off the track and hit a tunnel support, killing three people and injuring 25. Coincidentally, this accident occurred about 30 minutes after [[Air Florida Flight 90]] crashed into the [[14th Street Bridge (Potomac River)|14th Street Bridge]] during a major snowstorm.<ref name="WMATA History"/>

On January 20, 2003, during construction of a new canopy at the [[Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (WMATA station)|Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport]], Metro began running trains through the center track even though it had not been constructed for standard operations, and a Blue Line train derailed at the switch. No injuries resulted, but the accident delayed construction by a number of weeks.<ref name="February 27, 2003">{{cite news

On January 7, 2007, a Green Line train carrying approximately 120 people derailed near the [[Mount Vernon Square / 7th Street <U+2013> Convention Center (WMATA station)|Mount Vernon Square / 7th Street <U+2013> Convention Center]] station in downtown Washington.  Trains were single-tracking at the time, and the derailment of the fifth car occurred where the train was switching from the south to northbound track.  The accident injured at least 18 people and prompted the rescue of 60 people from a tunnel.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/07/AR2007010700827.html |title=Green Line Metro Train Derails; at Least 18 Hurt |last=Klein |first=Allison |coauthors=Martin Well |date=2007-01-08 |pages=A01 |work=The Washington Post |accessdate=2009-06-24}}</ref> At least one person had a serious but non-life-threatening injury.<ref name=Jan07>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/08/AR2007010800195.html|title=Federal Investigators Question Metro's Safety|last=Weiss|first=Eric M.|date=2007-01-09|work=The Washington Post|pages=A01|accessdate=2009-01-27}}</ref>

The Mount Vernon Square accident was one of a series of five derailments involving [[Washington Metro rolling stock#5000-Series|5000-Series]] cars, with four of those occurring on side tracks and not involving passengers.<ref name=Jan07 />

On June 9, 2008, an Orange Line train (2000-series) derailed between the Rosslyn and Court House stations.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/06/09/AR2008060901703.html |title=Metro Train Derails, Causing Major Delays |work=The Washington Post |last=Sun |first=Lena H. |coauthors=Daniela Dean |date=2008-06-10 |pages=B01 |accessdate=2009-06-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/06/10/AR2008061000546.html |title=Metro Says Operator Wasn't First to Detect Derailment |work=The Washington Post |last=Sun |first=Lena H. |date=2008-06-11 |pages=B01 |accessdate=2009-06-24}}</ref>

On February 12, 2010, a Red Line train derailed at about 10:13 a.m. as it left the [[Farragut North (WMATA station)|Farragut North]] station in downtown Washington. After leaving the station, the train entered the [[pocket track]] north of the station.  As it continued, an automatic derailer at the end of the pocket track intentionally derailed the train as a safety measure.  If the train had continued moving forward on the pocket track, it would have entered the path of an oncoming train.  The wheels of the first two cars in the six-car, White-Flint-bound train were forced off the tracks, stopping the train. Almost all of the estimated 345 passengers were evacuated from the damaged train by 11:50 a.m. and the NTSB arrived on the accident scene by noon. Two minor injuries were reported, and a third passenger was taken to [[George Washington University Hospital]]. The cause is under investigation.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/getthere/2010/02/train_derails_at_farragut_nort.html |title=D.C.

== Safety measures ==
On July 13, 2009, WMATA adopted a "zero tolerance" policy for train or bus operators found to be texting or using other hand-held devices while on the job. This new and stricter policy came after investigations of several mass-transit accidents in the U.S. found that operators were texting at the time of the accident. The policy change was announced the day after a passenger of a Metro train videotaped the operator texting while operating the train.<ref>{{cite news |author= John Hughes |publisher= [[Bloomberg.com]] |url= http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103&sid=aQFnCkF0qCSs |title= Washington Metro Train Operators Caught Texting Will Be Fired |date= July 9, 2009 }}</ref>

Metro fares vary based on the distance traveled and the time of day at entry. During regular hours (weekdays from opening until 9:30 a.m. and 3<U+2013>7 p.m., and Friday and Saturday nights from 2:00 a.m. to closing), fares range from $1.95 to $5.00, depending on distance traveled. At all other times, fares are $1.60, $2.15, or $2.75, based on distance traveled.  Discounted fares are available for school children, the disabled, and the elderly.<ref name=fares>{{cite web|url=http://www.wmata.com/fares/metrorail.cfm|title=Metrorail Fares |publisher=WMATA|accessdate=2010-12-09}}</ref> Metro charges reduced fares on all [[Federal holidays in the United States|federal holidays]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wmata.com/about_metro/board_of_directors/board_docs/121406_6GMGRProposedBudget.pdf|title=General Manager<U+2019>s Fiscal 2008 Proposed Operating and Capital Budgets|date=2006-12-14|publisher=WMATA|accessdate=2009-01-27}}</ref>

[[Image:WMATA farecard vending machines.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A row of fare-card machines, each with buttons, slots for money and farecards, and printed instructions.|Standard self-service vending machines for passes and farecards located at each station]]

Riders enter and exit the system using a [[stored-value card]] in the form of a paper [[magnetic stripe card|magnetic stripe farecard]] or a [[proximity card]] known as [[SmarTrip]]. The fare is deducted from the balance of the card upon exiting the system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wmata.com/getting_around/faregates.cfm|title=How to Use Metrorail Faregates, Farecards, and Passes|publisher=WMATA|accessdate=2009-01-27}}</ref> Farecards are purchased primarily at vending machines in each station. Farecards can hold up to $45 in value and are reused until the value of the card reaches zero.  If the card contains the exact fare needed to exit, leaving the card at a zero balance, the card is not returned by the exit gate. Alternatively, passengers may purchase passes at most farecard vending machines. The passes are used the same way as farecards but grant riders unlimited travel within the system for a certain period of time. Some Metro passes restrict the times and distances that the pass may be used.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wmata.com/fares/purchase/passes.cfm|title=Metro Pass and Farecard Options|publisher=WMATA|accessdate=2009-01-27}}</ref>

Users can add value to any farecard, but riders must pay an [[exit fare]] if the cost of a trip is higher than their card's balance. SmarTrip users are allowed to exit the system with a negative balance but must add the fare to the card before re-entering the system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wmata.com/fares/smartrip/important_info.cfm|title=Important Information about SmarTrip|publisher=WMATA|accessdate=2009-01-27}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> Riders may transfer for free, provided they do not exit through the faregates. SmarTrip users receive a $0.50 discount on bus-to-rail and rail-to-bus transfers.<ref name=fares />

On {{#dateformat:January 7, 2010}}, the WMATA board approved hearings to consider a temporary 10-cent fare increase on rail and bus fares to take effect in April through July 2010 in order to make up for a budget shortfall.<ref>{{cite news|title=10-cent fare hike proposed for Metro|first=Ann Scott|last=Tyson|page=B1|date=January 8, 2010|work=Washington Post|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/07/AR2010010702588.html?hpid=newswell|accessdate=January 8, 2010}}</ref>  The increase was approved, took effect on {{#dateformat:February 28, 2010}}, and will last through {{#dateformat:June 26, 2010}} (unless the board takes further action to extend or increase it).<ref>{{cite press release

Due to severe deficits, Metro introduced a "staggered" fare increase beginning in June 2010 and further increasing on August 1, 2010<U+2014>its largest increase ever.  An increase in fares of from 25 cents to 45 cents depending on distance was implemented, along with an additional "peak-of-the-peak" fare increase of 20 cents during morning and afternoon rush periods.  Due to problems with memory capacity and software upgrades on faregates, as of August 12, the morning peak-of-the-peak had not been implemented.  Additionally, users of paper farecards will be charged a 25 cent surcharge on each trip in addition to the regular fare; this surcharge does not apply to SmarTrip users.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

== Future expansion ==
WMATA expects an average of one million riders daily by 2030. The need to increase capacity has renewed plans to add 220 cars to the system and reroute trains to alleviate congestion at the busiest stations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wmata.com/about_metro/news/PressReleaseDetail.cfm?ReleaseID=2064 |title=Metro details improvements to meet future capacity needs |accessdate=2008-12-08 |date=2008-04-18 |publisher=WMATA }}</ref> Population growth in the region has also revived efforts to extend service, build new stations, and construct additional lines.

=== Silver Line ===
The most prominent expansion is the [[Silver Line (Washington Metro)|Silver Line]], a {{convert|23|mi|km|adj=on}} extension from the Orange Line into [[Loudoun County, Virginia]] by way of [[Tysons Corner, Virginia|Tysons Corner]] and [[Washington Dulles International Airport]]. Rail to Dulles has been discussed since the system opened in 1976. The current Silver Line project was formally proposed in 2002 and initially approved by the [[Federal Transit Administration]] in 2004.<ref name=silverfact>{{cite web

=== Blue Line realignment ===
Blue Line trains share a single tunnel with Orange Line trains in order to cross the Potomac River. The current tunnel limits service in each direction, creating a choke point. A 2001 proposal would have rerouted the Blue Line between the [[Rosslyn (WMATA station)|Rosslyn]] and [[Stadium<U+2013>Armory (WMATA station)|Stadium<U+2013>Armory]] stations by building a bridge or tunnel from Virginia to a new station in [[Georgetown, Washington, D.C.|Georgetown]].<ref name="NARPAC">{{cite web|url=http://www.narpac.org/METROLRP.HTM|title=Metro Long Range Planning|publisher=National Association to Restore Pride in America's Capital|accessdate=2009-01-25}}</ref> The proposal was later rejected due to cost.<ref>{{cite news|first = Peter|last = Whoriskey|url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A54434-2005Apr14.html|title = Choke Point Slows Orange Line Trains|work =The Washington Post|page = B01|date =2005-04-15}}</ref> In October 2008, Metro released a study on the possibility of rerouting some Blue Line trains over the [[14th Street Bridge (Potomac River)|14th Street Bridge]], currently used by Yellow Line trains. This Blue Line realignment would increase service directly to downtown and relieve congestion at the Rosslyn tunnel. If implemented, the new service between Franconia<U+2013>Springfield and Greenbelt stations may be referred to as a new line.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wmata.com/about_metro/riders_advisory_council/minutes/docs/Blue%20Line%20Split%20RAC%20Presentation,%20October%208,%202008.pdf|title=New Rail Service, Franconia-Springfield to Greenbelt|date=October 2008|publisher=WMATA|accessdate=2009-01-25}}</ref>

=== Fort Belvoir and Fort Meade extensions ===
In 2005, the [[United States Department of Defense|Defense Department]] announced that it would be shifting 18,000 jobs to [[Fort Belvoir]] in Virginia and at least 5,000 jobs to [[Fort Meade]] in Maryland by 2012, as part of that year's [[Base Realignment and Closure, 2005|Base Realignment and Closure]] plan. In anticipation of such a move, local officials and the military proposed extending the Blue and Green Lines to service each base. The proposed extension of the Green Line could cost $100 million per mile, and a [[light rail]] extension to Fort Belvoir was estimated to cost up to $800 million. Neither proposal has established timelines for planning or construction.<ref name=belvoir>{{cite news| first = Leef| last = Smith| title = Metro Studies Ft.

In 2008, officials began to explore the possibility of adding a station in the [[Potomac Yard]] area of Alexandria on the Blue and Yellow Lines between the [[Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (WMATA station)|National Airport]] and [[Braddock Road (WMATA station)|Braddock Road]] stations. The project remains in the exploratory stages, and construction funding (estimated at $150 million) has not been approved.<ref>{{cite news| first = Lena| last = Sun| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/06/05/AR2008060501570.html| title=New Push For Metro Station in Alexandria| work=The Washington Post| page=B01| date=2008-06-06}}</ref>

=== Non-Metrorail projects ===

A number of [[light rail]] and urban [[Tram|streetcar]] projects have been proposed to extend or supplement service provided by Metro. Like the Silver Line in Virginia, the proposed [[Purple Line (Maryland)|Purple Line]] has been in planning since the 1980s.<ref name=shaver>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/01/22/AR2009012203666.html|title=Leggett Endorses Light-Rail Plan|last=Shaver|first=Katherine|date=2009-01-23|work=The Washington Post|page=B03|accessdate=2009-01-26}}</ref> The project was originally envisioned as a circular heavy rail line connecting the outer stations on each branch of Metrorail system, in a pattern roughly mirroring the [[Interstate 495 (Capital Beltway)|Capital Beltway]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sierraclub.org/dc/sprawl/purple-line/purple-line-connections.html|title=Where Would the Purple Line Go?|publisher=Sierra Club|accessdate=2009-01-26}}</ref> The current proposal would create a light rail system in Maryland between the [[Bethesda (WMATA station)|Bethesda]] and [[New Carrollton (WMATA station)|New Carrollton]] stations by way of [[Silver Spring (WMATA station)|Silver Spring]] and [[College Park <U+2013> University of Maryland (WMATA station)|College Park]]. Such a plan would connect both branches of the Red Line to the Green and Orange Lines, and would decrease the travel time between suburban Metro stations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.purplelinemd.com/overview|title=Overview&nbsp;<U+2013> The Purple Line|publisher=Maryland Transit Administration|accessdate=2009-01-26}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> The project is still undergoing regulatory approval but received significant backing from local officials and Maryland lawmakers in January 2009.<ref name=shaver />

The [[Corridor Cities Transitway]] (CCT) would link [[Clarksburg, Maryland]] in northern [[Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery County]] with the [[Shady Grove (WMATA station)|Shady Grove]] station on the Red Line.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.montgomeryplanning.org/transportation/projects/corridor.shtm |title=The Corridor Cities Transitway|publisher=Montgomery County Planning Department|accessdate=2009-01-26}}</ref> The CCT is currently scheduled to open in 2016.<ref name=mwcog>{{cite web|url=http://www.mwcog.org/clrp/projects/transithov.asp|title=Major Transit and HOV Improvements|date=2008-11-19|publisher=Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments|accessdate=2009-01-26}}</ref> In 2005, a Maryland lawmaker proposed a light rail system to connect areas of [[Southern Maryland]], especially the rapidly-growing area around the town of [[Waldorf, Maryland|Waldorf]], to the [[Branch Avenue (WMATA station)|Branch Avenue]] station on the Green Line. The project is still in the planning stages.<ref>{{cite news|first = Amit |last = Paley|url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A18469-2005Feb12.html|title = Dyson Pushes Light Rail, Expansion of Bridge|work = The Washington Post|page = SM01|date =2005-02-15}}</ref>

In Washington, a new [[DC Streetcar]] system is under construction to link various neighborhoods to Washington Metro stations. The first tram line will connect [[Bolling Air Force Base]] to the [[Anacostia (WMATA station)|Anacostia]] station and is expected to open in 2010. Streetcar routes have been proposed in the [[Atlas District]], [[Capitol Hill, Washington, D.C.|Capitol Hill]], and the [[K Street (Washington, D.C.)|K Street corridor]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Lena |last=Sun |title=Transit Plan on Track |date=2008-07-13 |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/12/AR2008071201834.html |work=The Washington Post |page=C01 |accessdate=2008-07-13 }}</ref> In Virginia, the [[Pike Transit Initiative]] is a streetcar project that will link [[Annandale, Virginia]] along [[Virginia State Route 244|Columbia Pike]] to the [[Pentagon City (WMATA station)|Pentagon City]] station in Arlington. The streetcars are expected to begin service in 2011.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/01/13/AR2008011303609.html|title=Streetcar Plan Has Money and Desire|last=Laris|first=Michael|date=2008-01-14|work=The Washington Post|page=B01|accessdate=2009-01-26}}</ref>
