The '''University of Michigan basketball scandal''' was a six-year investigation of the relationship between the [[University of Michigan]], its [[Michigan Wolverines men's basketball|men's basketball teams]] and [[Booster (sports)|basketball team booster]] Ed Martin. As a result of the investigation, the [[Michigan Wolverines|Wolverine]] men's basketball program was punished for numerous [[NCAA]] rules violations, principally involving payments booster Martin made to several players to [[money laundering|launder money]] from an illegal [[gambling]] operation. It is one of the largest incidents involving payments to college athletes in American collegiate history. An initial investigation by the school was joined by the NCAA, [[Big Ten Conference]], [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI), [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS), and the [[United States Department of Justice]] (DOJ).

The case began when the investigation of an automobile accident during [[Mateen Cleaves]]' 1996 recruiting trip revealed a curious relationship between Martin and the Wolverine basketball program dating back to the 1980s. Several Michigan basketball players were implicated over the next few years and by 1999 some were called before a federal [[grand jury]]. Four eventual professional basketball players&mdash;[[Chris Webber]], [[Maurice Taylor]], [[Robert Traylor]] and [[Louis Bullock]]&mdash;were discovered to have borrowed a total of $616,000 from Martin. During the investigation, Webber claimed not to have had any financial relationship with Martin, but eventually confessed to taking loans from Martin. He was both fined in the legal system and briefly suspended by [[National Basketball Association]] after performing public service.

In 1997, coach [[Steve Fisher]] was fired for his involvement in violations relating to the scandal. By the fall of 2002, it was obvious that the four players were in fact guilty of taking money from Martin, and had thus compromised their amateur status. In response, Michigan placed the basketball program on two years' probation. It also withdrew from postseason consideration for the 2002&ndash;03 season, vacated all or part of five past seasons and removed the players' names and achievements from its record book. A few months later, the NCAA accepted these punishments, doubled both the probation period and the post-season ineligibility, penalized the school one scholarship for four seasons, and ordered Michigan to disassociate from the four guilty players until 2012. The punishment cost the 2002&ndash;2003 team its post-season eligibility, cost past teams the [[1997 National Invitation Tournament]] and the 1998 [[Big Ten Conference Men's Basketball Tournament|Big Ten Tournament]] championships as well as appearances in the [[1992 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1992]] and [[1993 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament]] [[Final Four]]s. It cost Chris Webber his All-American 1993 honors, Traylor his MVP awards in the 1997 NIT and 1998 Big Ten Tournament, as well as Bullock's standing as the school's third all-time leading scorer and all-time leader in 3-point field goals. The additional year of post-season ineligibility was overturned on appeal.

==Background==
Accounts of what happened during the night of February 17, 1996 vary. On that night, a [[Ford Explorer]] driven by either Taylor or Traylor, depending on the source,<ref name=AesfsylRIctad/><ref name=EM6KFiMBS/><ref name=SwkAfrM/> went out of control while returning along [[M-14 (Michigan highway)|M-14]] from a party in [[Detroit]], {{convert|40|mi|km|lk=on}} east of Michigan's campus in [[Ann Arbor]].<ref name=AesfsylRIctad/>  Among the passengers was high school star Mateen Cleaves, who was on his official recruiting visit. When an investigation revealed that the trip included a visit to Ed Martin's home, the University investigated his relationship with the basketball program.<ref name=EM6KFiMBS/>  Martin was reportedly returning to Ann Arbor from Detroit with Traylor, Taylor, Cleaves, [[Willie Mitchell (basketball)|Willie Mitchell]], Bullock, and Ron Oliver after a party that included drugs, [[stripper]]s and alcohol.<ref name=SwkAfrM/><ref name=AesfsylRIctad/>  Accounts of the party vary.<ref name=AesfsylRIctad/>  By some accounts the party was hosted by Martin,<ref name=SwkAfrM/><ref name=EMRHlairiMbh/> but by other accounts Martin's house was a stop on the way to a party at Detroit's [[Westin Hotel]].<ref name=AesfsylRIctad/>  Martin, a retired [[Ford Motor Company]] electrician,<ref name=BUbwrfttels>{{cite web|url=http://www.mlive.com/wolverines/aanews/basketball/index.ssf?/stories/wolverines/20000407knba07.html|title=Banned U-M booster will reveal financial ties to ex-players, lawyer says|accessdate=2008-08-12|date=2000-04-07|publisher=MLive.com|work=[[Ann Arbor News]]}}</ref> provided all the players with money.<ref name=AesfsylRIctad/> During the rollover accident, Traylor broke his arm and was lost for the season.<ref name=AesfsylRIctad>{{cite web|url=http://www.mlive.com/stories/wolverines/20020322accident_effects.html|title=Accident's effects still felt six years later: Roberson: It changed the athletic department|accessdate=2008-08-12|date=2002-03-22|publisher=MLive.com|work=[[Ann Arbor News]]|author=Cnockaert, Jim}}</ref> Mitchell transferred from Michigan to the [[UAB Blazers men's basketball|University of Alabama-Birmingham]] after his sophomore 1995&ndash;1996 season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsstats.com/jazzyj/greats/cba99/mitchell.htm|title=Willie Mitchell, Alabama-Birmingham, 6-8, F|accessdate=2008-08-13}}</ref>  Bullock, Cleaves (who eventually signed with rival [[Michigan State Spartans men's basketball|Michigan State]]), Taylor, and Traylor all went on to be drafted by [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) teams, but Bullock has yet to play in the NBA.

The NCAA uses a [[statute of limitations]] of four years. Thus, at any time the NCAA can open or re-open an investigation for an infraction occurring within the last four years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mlive.com/wolverines/aanews/basketball/index.ssf?/stories/wolverines/19990903white03.frm|title= Sources say White took money, too: Ex-U-M player Albert White, family and friends accepted $37,000 from banned booster, sources report |accessdate=2008-08-22|date=1999-09-03|publisher=MLive.com|work=[[Ann Arbor News]]|author=Thomaselli, Rich}}</ref>  However, NCAA convention is to date violations based on when they learned about the infraction.<ref name=SwkAfrM/>  Thus, events that had occurred far more than four years prior to the investigation came under its purview.  The initial accident reports revealed several inconsistencies and violations that induced expanded investigation.<ref name=AesfsylRIctad/>

Michigan admitted to the secondary NCAA violation of transporting a recruit more than {{convert|30|mi|km}} from campus.<ref name=AesfsylRIctad/>  Questions were immediately raised about whether Taylor actually owned the expensive [[sport utility vehicle]]. The NCAA asked for leasing documentation of Taylor's vehicle and Michigan investigated the registrations of its players' vehicles.<ref name=AesfsylRIctad/> The University soon required that all the vehicles driven by its players be part of a special vehicle registration program.

==Martin's relationship with the program==
In March 1997, Michigan and the Big Ten released the results of an investigation of Martin's relationship with the school. The investigation determined that Martin had nurtured a relationship that involved some minor violations. The violations that were published were that Martin was present at a recruit's home during a visit by head coach Fisher; and he'd given a U&ndash;M player a birthday cake. Fisher prevented Martin from committing serious additional violations by keeping him from placing a deposit on an apartment for a player. He also stopped Martin from buying airplane tickets for another player's family. A second October 1997 private investigation also failed to reveal any large violations.<ref name=AesfsylRIctad/>

===1980s===
Martin befriended [[Perry Watson]], coach for [[Southwestern High School (Michigan)|Southwestern High School]] of Detroit, and provided gifts to the team's players. At this time, he began a close friendship with [[Bill Frieder]], Michigan's coach from 1981 to 1989. When Frieder recruited a Southwestern High School prospect, Martin was present. Martin then began attending Michigan games with the prospect's father when the student enrolled. Martin also attended games and practices with Watson.<ref name=EMRHlairiMbh/>  Martin also developed a relationship with [[George Raveling]] who regularly recruited from Detroit high schools for the [[Iowa Hawkeyes men's basketball|Iowa Hawkeyes]].  He also received complementary tickets to Iowa games while Raveling was coach.  Martin attempted to give gifts and cash to Frieder recruit [[Terry Mills]].<ref name=AesfsylRIctad/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mlive.com/wolverines/aanews/basketball/index.ssf?/stories/wolverines/19971009tmills_linked.frm|title=Booster earlier gave Terry Mills favors: Terry Mills worried gifts might jeopardize future, his high school coach said|accessdate=2008-08-20|date=1997-10-09|publisher=Michigan Live LLC|work=[[Ann Arbor News]]|author=Pitts, Antoine}}</ref>

===Webber===
Martin noticed Webber during a middle school game. Martin attended Webber's church, where Webber's father was [[deacon]] and began fostering a relationship by making frequent visits to the Webber family home. Between 1988&ndash;1993 Martin gives Webber about $280,000.<ref name=EMRHlairiMbh/>  Eventually, Webber would confess to having received and repaid only $38,200, an amount identified via a specific transaction tied to Webber.<ref name=WAJPGoaCC/>

===1990s===
In September 1996, athletic director Joe Roberson learned that during the previous month Martin had tried to place deposits on apartments for Traylor and [[Louis Bullock]]. Martin had also offered airline tickets to Bullock's parents so they could attend a tournament in [[Puerto Rico]].  It emerged that Fisher had known about Martin's actions at the time. While Fisher had ordered the deposits retrieved and made sure the tickets weren't used, he didn't tell anyone in the athletic or compliance offices, as he was required to do. As a result of Robertson's findings, he ordered interviews of the basketball team and team coaches.<ref name=EMRHlairiMbh/> 

After Frieder left Michigan in 1989, Martin immediately formed an equally close relationship with his successor, Fisher. Martin gave Fisher's family gifts.<ref name=EMRHlairiMbh/> The March 1997 Big Ten report showed that official University phone records documented that the coaching staff called Martin's home 39 times. Between the 1991&ndash;92 and the 1993&ndash;94 seasons, records showed that Martin received 97 tickets to Michigan basketball games either for free or under his special arrangement to have tickets made available for purchase.<ref name=AesfsylRIctad/>  Watson joined the Michigan basketball coaching staff in 1991.<ref name=EMRHlairiMbh/>  The October 1997 investigation revealed that Fisher had provided Martin with passes for sixteen complimentary tickets from 1994 to 1997, and that his secretary and other clerical workers made out ten more such passes. In addition, six passes where signed with the PW initials of departed coach Watson. Watson denied making such passes available and a handwriting analysis matched five of the six to Fisher. Fisher was fired following this investigation became public on October 10, 1997, which was just a week before the start of basketball practices.<ref name=FfbpnhsGs>{{cite web|url=http://www.mlive.com/wolverines/aanews/basketball/index.ssf?/stories/wolverines/19971011fisher_fired.frm|title=Fisher fired, basketball program needs higher standards, Goss says|accessdate=2008-08-13|publisher=Michigan Live LLC|work=[[Ann Arbor News]]}}</ref> 

In June 1997, the ''[[Detroit Free Press]]'' revealed sources that claimed both Chris Webber and Taylor had received at least $100,000 from Martin, but that Webber had repaid the money after turning pro.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D00E2D71F3AF932A35755C0A961958260|title=Webber Linked To Booster|accessdate=2008-08-09|date=1999-05-15|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref>  A pattern of Martin befriending young basketball stars eventually became clear. Martin paid $280,000 to Webber from 1988 (when he was a ninth-grader at [[Detroit Country Day School]]) to 1993 (his sophomore year at Michigan, after which he turned pro). Martin also befriended Traylor as a freshman in high school. Martin was at Traylor's home when Fisher made a recruiting visit. Between 1994 (his senior year at [[Murray-Wright High School]] in Detroit) and 1998 (his junior year at Michigan, after which he turned pro), Martin gave Traylor about $160,000.<ref name=EMRHlairiMbh/>  Martin befriended Taylor when he was in high school. Between 1995 and 1998 (during his time at Michigan), Martin gave Taylor about $105,000.<ref name=EMRHlairiMbh/> Since Bullock went to high school in Maryland, he did not know Martin before coming to Michigan. Martin gave Bullock about $71,000 during his four years at Michigan which ended in 1999.<ref name=EMRHlairiMbh/>  

Roberson also learned that during the 1992 Final Four, Fisher made two of the limited supply of team rooms available to Martin. Martin gave one hotel room paid for by Michigan to Webber's father&mdash;a violation of NCAA rules.<ref name=EMRHlairiMbh/>  For his part, Martin denied any wrongdoing when questioned by an NCAA enforcement representative. However, he later refused to cooperate with the University or the NCAA, forcing Michigan to ban him from any contact with the athletic program in March 1997.<ref name=EMRHlairiMbh>{{cite web|url=http://www.michigandaily.com/content/ed-martin-revealed-his-long-and-infamous-road-michigan-basketball-history|title=Ed Martin Revealed: His long and infamous road into Michigan basketball history|accessdate=2008-08-10|date=2003-05-12|publisher=|work=[[The Michigan Daily]]}}</ref>

==Raid and subpoenas==
After the Michigan/Big Ten investigation and the private inviestigation, no serious violations arose. For example, Robert Traylor, Chris Webber, [[Jalen Rose]], and Maurice Taylor were cleared in October 1997.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mlive.com/wolverines/aanews/basketball/index.ssf?/stories/wolverines/19971009traylor_not_linked.frm|title=No violation found against Traylor: Part of report examines player's relationship with Detroit booster Ed Martin|accessdate=2008-08-20|date=1997-10-09|publisher=Michigan Live LLC|work=[[Ann Arbor News]]|author=Mulherin, Brian}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mlive.com/wolverines/aanews/basketball/index.ssf?/stories/wolverines/19971009taylor_not_linked.frm|title=Taylor not linked to team booster|accessdate=2008-08-20|date=1997-10-09|publisher=Michigan Live LLC|work=[[Ann Arbor News]]|author=Heuser, John}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mlive.com/wolverines/aanews/basketball/index.ssf?/stories/wolverines/19971009no_new_evidence.frm|title=Investigation doesn't show new evidence: Key points of report dealing with Ed Martin's relationship with Jalen Rose and Chris Webber listed|accessdate=2008-08-20|date=1997-10-09|publisher=Michigan Live LLC|work=[[Ann Arbor News]]|author=Deegan, Jason}}</ref>  In April 1999, the FBI and IRS raided several Detroit-area homes to stop a [[numbers game]] operation in the area's Ford plants.

As a result of the investigations, the ''[[Detroit Free Press]]'' reported in May of 1999, that a federal grand jury [[subpoena]]ed several Michigan basketball players to investigate the relationship between Martin and the basketball program.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9901E3D7163EF936A25756C0A96F958260|title=BASKETBALL; Basketball Fan In New Inquiry |accessdate=2008-08-08|date=1999-05-15|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref>

==Federal indictments==
===Ed Martin===
In late 1999, Martin originally agreed to a plea bargain in which he agreed to disclose information about the payments. The agreement with the [[United States Attorney]]'s office was nearly finalized in January 2000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mlive.com/wolverines/aanews/basketball/index.ssf?/stories/wolverines/20000113ynewed13.frm|title=Plea deal may force booster to tell all|accessdate=2008-08-18|date=2000-01-13|publisher=Michigan Live LLC|work=[[Ann Arbor News]]|author=Thomaselli, Rich}}</ref>  The paperwork for the plea agreement was to be finalized in March 2000 for the former Ford Motor Company employee to plead guilty to one count of federal gambling and one count of [[income tax evasion]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mlive.com/wolverines/aanews/basketball/index.ssf?/stories/wolverines/20000315kbt16.html|title=Newspaper: Plea agreement reached for banned Michigan booster|accessdate=2008-08-18|date=2000-03-16|publisher=Michigan Live LLC|work=[[Ann Arbor News]]}}</ref><ref name=Ubboopd/>  He and his son, Carlton, backed out in May 2000, preferring to take their chances at trial due to the likelihood of light punishment for first-time offenders.<ref name=Ubboopd>{{cite web|url=http://www.mlive.com/wolverines/aanews/basketball/index.ssf?/stories/wolverines/20000504amartin04.frm|title=U-M booster backs out of plea deal|accessdate=2008-08-18|date=2000-05-04|publisher=Michigan Live LLC|work=[[Ann Arbor News]]|author=Thomaselli, Rich}}</ref>  Under the plea agreement in which they would have forfeited $100,000 and faced 6&ndash;15 months in prison, they would have been able to keep their homes. If found guilty at trial, they could have received up to 5 years imprisonment and $250,000 per count, but they would not have had to agree to cooperate with the University investigation.<ref name=Ubboopd/>

Less than a week after Martin backed out of his plea agreement, several former players were subpoenaed to testify before grand juries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mlive.com/wolverines/aanews/basketball/index.ssf?/stories/wolverines/20000518aed18.frm|title=Former U-M players to appear before grand jury|accessdate=2008-08-21|date=2000-05-18|publisher=Michigan Live LLC|work=[[Ann Arbor News]]|author=Thomaselli, Rich}}</ref>  In August 2000, Traylor and Bullock, by this time professional basketball players in the [[NBA]] and Italy respectively, were confirmed to have taken payments from Martin.

Martin and Watson had a falling-out in the early 1990s,<ref name=Uctob/> shortly after Watson joined the Michigan staff. Webber's father also gave sealed testimony before the grand jury.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mlive.com/wolverines/aanews/basketball/index.ssf?/stories/wolverines/20000615awebber15.frm|title=Grand jury hears from Webber's father|accessdate=2008-08-21|date=2000-06-15|publisher=Michigan Live LLC|work=[[Ann Arbor News]]|author=Larcom,Geoff}}</ref>

On March 21, 2002&mdash;after almost three years of testimony&mdash;the grand jury returned an eight-count indictment charging Martin, his wife Hilda and their friend Clarence Malvo with running an illegal gambling business at the [[Ford River Rouge Complex|Ford River Rouge plant]], money laundering and conspiracy to launder money. According to the indictment, Martin made illicit loans totalling $616,000 to Webber, Taylor, Bullock and Traylor to launder money from an illegal [[numbers game]] at Detroit&ndash;area auto plants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mlive.com/wolverines/aanews/basketball/index.ssf?/stories/wolverines/20020322martin_indictment_text.html|title=Text of the indictment|accessdate=2008-08-19|date=2002-03-22|publisher=Michigan Live LLC|work=[[Ann Arbor News]]}}</ref>  The loans were made with the understanding that they would be repaid once the players turned pro. Martin was indicted for having paid Webber a total of $280,000 between 1988&ndash;1993, which included time from Webber's freshman year at [[Detroit Country Day School]] in {{city-state|Birmingham|Michigan}} to his sophomore year at Michigan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E01E2D6123AF931A35757C0A9649C8B63|title=N.B.A.: ROUNDUP; Webber Denies Taking Money|accessdate=2008-08-09|date=2002-04-02|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref>

Martin, his wife, Hilda, and Clarence Malvo were under federal indictment for conspiracy to engage in illegal gambling and could have faced up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine if convicted. Mr. Martin had also been charged with seven additional counts: having an illegal gambling business, conspiracy to launder money, three counts of laundering money and two counts of using money from illegal activities. The charge against Hilda Martin was dropped as part of a plea agreement.<ref name=EM6KFiMBS/> On April 8, 2002, Malvo pleaded guilty to grand jury [[perjury]] for testifying that he did not work for Martin.  On May 28, 2002 Martin pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to launder money. He agreed to cooperate with investigations by the government, Michigan and the NCAA. The other seven charges against Martin were dropped in addition to those against Hilda.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mlive.com/wolverines/aanews/basketball/index.ssf?/stories/wolverines/20020528martin_pleads_guilty.html|title=Martin pleads guilty to federal conspiracy charge|accessdate=2008-08-21|date=2002-05-28|publisher=Michigan Live LLC|work=[[Ann Arbor News]]|author=Miller, Geralda}}</ref> Furthermore, Martin was barred from associating with the team by a ban, which made any continuing financial relationship with him in violation of NCAA rules and to be considered a new violation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.michigandaily.com/content/history-ed-martin-and-michigan|title=The History of Ed Martin and Michigan|accessdate=2008-08-22|date=Summer 2002|work=[[The Michigan Daily]]}}</ref>

===Chris Webber===
In September 2002, Webber was indicted on five charges, including obstruction of justice and lying to a federal grand jury, for having misrepresented his relationship with Martin. Each charge was punishable by five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.<ref name=PCNWFATG/><ref name=PBWWFCHLtFGJ/>  He vowed to fight the charges.<ref name=PBWWFCHLtFGJ>{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C05E6DF1531F932A2575AC0A9649C8B63|title=PRO BASKETBALL; Webber Will Fight Charges He Lied to Federal Grand Jury|accessdate=2008-08-08|date=2002-09-11|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref>

Martin plead guilty to running an illegal [[lottery]] at the [[Ford Motors]] plant he worked at to provide proceeds for the players. Martin testified that he paid Webber $280,000 in cash and gifts, but as of January 2003 Webber denied receipt of money from Martin and maintained that he had testified truthfully to a grand jury in 2000 on such matters.<ref name=PBNDOoWC/>  Martin stated that there was always an understanding that the money would be repaid after the players became professionals.<ref name=CNBMFNP/>  In the 2000 grand jury investigation, Webber had been asked about whether his off-campus apartment rent had been paid by Martin and whether he had received spending money, jewelry, clothing or a stereo. Webber generally responded by saying either that he could not recall or that he did not think he had received such gifts.<ref name=PBNDOoWC/>  However, prosecutors say that Webber, after turning professional, gave Martin <nowiki>''a significant sum of money, in cash, as a partial repayment.''</nowiki><ref name=PBNDOoWC/> In December 2002, Webber's father admitted he had accepted gifts and a small loan from Martin, which contradicted earlier statements.<ref name=PBNDOoWC/><ref name=PCNWFATG>{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEFD6153BF936A35751C1A9649C8B63|title=PLUS: COURT NEWS; Webber's Father Admits Taking Gifts |accessdate=2008-08-08|date=2002-12-05|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|work=[[The New York Times]]|author=Enders, David}}</ref> Prosecutors also accused Webber's aunt of lying about a meeting she had with Martin in the updated filing.<ref name=PBNDOoWC/>

Martin's death largely took the air out of the federal perjury case against Webber. In July 2003, on the day before jury selection in the case was due to begin, Webber plead guilty to the reduced charge of [[criminal contempt]] in order to avoid a possible jail sentence. He admitted to having received and repaid $38,200. The deal was subject to a discretionary fine and possible classification of the infraction as a [[felony]] by the [[United States District Court]] Judge Nancy Edmunds who would rule in September 2003. In exchange for the plea all other charges were dropped against him as were all charges against his father. The charges against Webber's aunt had been dropped after Martin's death.<ref name=WAJPGoaCC>{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D00E7DE143CF936A25754C0A9659C8B63|title=BASKETBALL; Webber Avoids Jail, Pleading Guilty on a Contempt Charge|accessdate=2008-08-08|date=2003-07-15|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|work=[[The New York Times]]|author=Nish, Caitlin}}</ref>

==Sanctions==
===Self-imposed===
By the fall of 2002, it had become clear that Michigan's basketball program was guilty of major violations. Ed Martin loaned Webber $280,000 from 1988&ndash;93, Traylor $160,000 from 1993&ndash;1998, Taylor $105,000 from 1994&ndash;1997, and Bullock $71,000 from 1996&ndash;1999.<ref name=BMPBP/><ref name=SwkAfrM>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/ncb/columns/weeklyword/index/1425084.html|title=Scandal won't keep Amaker from rebuilding Michigan|accessdate=2008-08-08|date=2003-08-30|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures|author=Katz, Andy}}</ref>  In response, Michigan decided to impose its own sanctions on the program.<ref name=BMPBP>{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A03E4DD1731F93BA35752C1A9649C8B63|title=BASKETBALL; Michigan Punishes Basketball Program |accessdate=2008-08-08|date=2002-11-08|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|work=[[The New York Times]]|author=Hakim, Danny}}</ref>  Initially, the University announced it would forfeit every game played while the four players were eligible.<ref name=BMPBP/> On November 7, 2002; Michigan president [[Mary Sue Coleman]] and athletic director Bill Martin announced that the school was imposing sanctions of its own on the basketball program. Among them:
*No postseason play in 2002&ndash;03, even though the players who took Martin's money were no longer at the school.
*The school vacated the entire 1992&ndash;93 season and every game it played from the 1995&ndash;96 season through the 1998&ndash;99 season. This included the [[1997 National Invitation Tournament]] title and the 1998 [[Big Ten Conference Men's Basketball Tournament|Big Ten Tournament]] title. It also vacated its two Final Four games in 1992 and its entire NCAA tournament record in 1993, 1996, 1998 and 1999. There is a difference between forfeiting a game and vacating a game; a vacated game is recognized as having never even happened. This included virtually the entire career of Fisher's successor, [[Brian Ellerbe]]. However, it did not include all games that Webber played or was eligible because all but the final two games of his freshman year were retained.
*Returning $450,000 received from the NCAA for postseason play in 1992, 1993, 1996, 1997, 1998 and 1999.
*Banners commemorating the 1992 and 1993 Final Four runs, the 1997 NIT title and 1998 Big Ten Tournament title would be removed from the rafters at [[Crisler Arena]].
*Two years' probation.

Coleman described what happened as "wrong, plain and simple." She also said, "I am determined that nothing like this will ever happen again at Michigan."<ref name=BMPBP/>

At 8:00 A.M. that same day, the four banners were removed from the rafters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mlive.com/wolverines/aanews/basketball/index.ssf?/stories/wolverines/20021108edmartin_banner_removal.html|title=Banner removal 'like dagger in my heart'|accessdate=2008-08-21|date=2002-11-08|publisher=MLive.com|work=[[Ann Arbor News]]|author=Heuser, John}}</ref>  Four days later, the athletic department officially deleted all mention of Webber, Taylor, Traylor and Bullock from the school's athletic records. These included Traylor's MVP awards in the 1997 NIT and 1998 Big Ten Tournament, as well as Bullock's standing as the school's third all-time leading scorer and all-time leader in 3-point field goals. The deletions came because the payments may have compromised their amateur status.

Michigan finished the 2002&ndash;2003 seasonseason with a 17&ndash;13 record, but sat out both that year's NCAA and NIT tournaments due to the self-imposed postseason ban.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C07E3DD1F3EF936A25750C0A9659C8B63|title=COLLEGE BASKETBALL: MEN'S ROUNDUP; Ohio State Upsets Wisconsin; Michigan State Also Advances|accessdate=2008-08-08|date=2003-03-15|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref>

===NCAA===
On May 8, 2003; the NCAA accepted Michigan's sanctions. It also imposed an additional two years' probation and docked the school one [[scholarship]] a year from 2004&ndash;2005 until 2007&ndash;2008. It also ordered the school to disassociate itself from Webber, Traylor, Taylor and Bullock until 2012. The NCAA also barred Michigan from postseason play for the 2003&ndash;04 season. Infractions committee chairman Thomas Yeager, who had come very close to imposing the [[death penalty (NCAA)|"death penalty"]] on the [[University of Alabama]] football program a few months earlier, called the Martin/Michigan affair "one of the three or four most egregious violations of NCAA bylaws" ever.<ref name=CNBMFNP/><ref name=NpUb>{{cite web|url=http://www.mlive.com/wolverines/aanews/basketball/index.ssf?/stories/wolverines/20030508ncaa_punishment.html|title=NCAA punishes U-M basketball: Case called 'one of the most serious ever,' which cheapens college athletics|accessdate=2008-08-21|date=2003-05-08|publisher=MLive.com|work=[[Ann Arbor News]]|author=Heuser, John}}</ref>  The disassociation meant that Michigan could not accept donations or recruiting assistance from any of the players for ten years.<ref name=NpUb/>  The NCAA criticized Fisher for allowing Martin access to the program (though Martin's involvement dated back to the Frieder era),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/print?id=1551150&type=columnist |title=ESPN.com - NCAA's penalty phase has a few flaws |publisher=[[ESPN.com]] |author=Katz, Andy  |date=2003-05-09|accessdate=2008-10-09}}</ref> but did not sanction him.<ref name=CNBMFNP>{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C02E4D6173FF93AA35756C0A9659C8B63|title=COLLEGES; N.C.A.A.

==Fallout==
In September 2003, the NCAA reversed its decision to add a second year of postseason ineligibility after hearing an appeal by the University.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mlive.com/wolverines/aanews/basketball/index.ssf?/stories/wolverines/20030925winning_appeal.html|title=U-M basketball wins NCAA appeal: Team will be allowed to play postseason games in 2004|accessdate=2008-08-13|date=2003-09-25|author=Heuser, John|publisher=Michigan Live LLC|work=[[Ann Arbor News]]}}</ref>  Also in September 2003, Judge Edmunds deferred sentencing until she could monitor Webber's service of 300 hours of [[community service]] at a middle-school [[literacy]] program for two summers that she ordered.<ref name=SoTTPTBAPfD/>  The literacy program is a six-week program and Webber was expected to work at least 150&nbsp;hours each summer.<ref name=WIwpMFsmhdos>{{cite web|url=http://www.mlive.com/wolverines/aanews/basketball/index.ssf?/stories/wolverines/20030923webber_iwontpay.html|title=Webber: I won't pay Michigan: Former star maintains he doesn't owe school|accessdate=2008-08-21|date=2003-09-23|publisher=Michigan Live LLC|work=[[Ann Arbor News]]}}</ref> Also in September the University announced it sought $695,000 in restitution from Webber. Webber was the only involved athlete that the University sought restitution from in part because he was the only one who confessed to lying to a grand jury. Webber stated that he did not feel the University's request was appropriate because he had not stolen from the University.<ref name=SoTTPTBAPfD>{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9501EED7143DF936A1575AC0A9659C8B63|title=Sports of The Times; Payback Time Brings A Price for Deception|accessdate=2008-08-09|date=2003-09-25|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|work=[[The New York Times]]|author=Roberts, Selena}}</ref><ref name=WIwpMFsmhdos/>

During the [[2003-2004 NBA season]], Webber was on the [[disabled list]] until February. When he returned, the NBA suspended him for three games for his guilty plea.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9400E0DB123DF93BA25751C0A9629C8B63|title=ROUNDUP: N.B.A.; Anthony Leads Nuggets To Victory Over 76ers |accessdate=2008-08-09|date=2004-02-18|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref> In September 2005, Judge Edmunds ruled that the conviction should be treated as a [[misdemeanor]] and that Webber should pay the maximum fine for such an offense which was $100,000. This ruling came after Webber served 330 hours of public service and accumulated $78,000 of related out of pocket expenses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A02E5DA1731F932A3575AC0A9639C8B63|title=SPORTS BRIEFING: BASKETBALL - Finley Picks Spurs |accessdate=2008-08-09|date=2005-09-01|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref>

The Michigan High School Athletic Association (MHSAA), following the release of court testimony, requested Webber's high school, Detroit Country Day (DCD), to forfeit the three state titles won with Webber in the lineup (1989&ndash;91). DCD conducted its own investigation, then called a press conference on March 2, 2004, to announce there was no "credible evidence" Webber's amateur status had been violated. When the MHSAA gave them the option of forfeiting games Webber played they decided not to.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9402E3DD143FF931A35750C0A9629C8B63|title=Sports Briefing: HIGH SCHOOL BASKETBALL - Webber's School Refuses to Forfeit Titles |accessdate=2008-08-09|date=2004-03-02|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref> Traylor's alma mater, Murray-Wright High, forfeited its entire 1994&ndash;95 season&mdash;Traylor's senior year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=1748049|title=Webber violated amateur status|accessdate=2008-08-22|date=2004-03-02|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures}}</ref>
