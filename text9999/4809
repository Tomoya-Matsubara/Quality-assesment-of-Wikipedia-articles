'''August Ferdinand M<U+00F6>bius''' ([[November 17]], [[1790]] - [[September 26]], [[1868]], ([[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: {{IPA|/<U+02C8>m<U+00F8>bi<U+028A>s/}}) was a [[Germany|German]] [[mathematician]] and theoretical [[astronomer]]. He was born in [[Schulpforta]], [[Saxony]], [[Germany]] and died in [[Leipzig]].

He is best known for his discovery of the [[M<U+00F6>bius strip]], a non-orientable two-dimensional surface with only one side when [[Embedding|embedded]] in three-dimensional [[Euclidean space]]. It was independently discovered by [[Johann Benedict Listing]] around the same time. M<U+00F6>bius was the first to introduce [[homogeneous coordinates]] into [[projective geometry]].  [[M<U+00F6>bius transformation]]s, important in projective geometry, are not to be confused with the [[M<U+00F6>bius transform]] of number theory, which also bears his name.  His interest was also in [[number theory]], and the important [[M<U+00F6>bius function]] <U+03BC>(''n'') and the [[M<U+00F6>bius inversion formula]] are named after him.

M<U+00F6>bius studied under [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] and was a professor at the [[University of Leipzig]]. 

== Trivia ==
*M<U+00F6>bius was a descendant of [[Martin Luther]] by way of his mother.
*The character of Johann Wilhelm M<U+00F6>bius - a particular scientist who tries to evade his own inventions by pretending to be insane - in [[D<U+00FC>rrenmatt]]'s satiric drama ''[[The Physicists]]'' is named after him.
*The [[asteroid]] 28516 M<U+00F6>bius is also named after him.
*There is a tribute to him in ''[[Serious Sam: The Second Encounter]]'', in the form on the deathmatch map dm_mobius (which has since spawned various spin-offs such as in the Unreal Tournament series).
*He also plays a pivotal part in the ''[[Necroscope]] ''book series.
