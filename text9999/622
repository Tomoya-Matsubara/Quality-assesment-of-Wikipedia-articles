'''Route 19''' is a [[state highway]] in [[Passaic County, New Jersey|Passaic County]], [[New Jersey]], [[United States]]. Also referred to as the '''Paterson Peripheral''', it runs {{convert|3.04|mi|km|2|abbr=on}} from an intersection with [[County Route 509 (New Jersey)|County Route 509]] (Broad Street) and County Route 609 (Colfax Avenue) in [[Clifton, New Jersey|Clifton]] north to another intersection with County Route 509 (Main Street) in downtown [[Paterson, New Jersey|Paterson]]. Berween [[U.S. Route 46]] in Clifton and [[Interstate 80 in New Jersey|Interstate 80]] in Paterson, Route 19 is a [[freeway]]. The main purpose of the route is to connect the [[Garden State Parkway]] to I-80 and downtown Paterson. The road was originally proposed as the Paterson spur of the Garden State Parkway that was to run north to [[Wayne, New Jersey|Wayne]]. In 1959, it was planned to become part of the Paterson Peripheral, an extension of [[New Jersey Route 20|Route 20]] from downtown Paterson. By 1971, the road was completed between the Garden State Parkway and I-80, at which time it received the Route 20 designation; the rest was cancelled in 1978 due to feared community disruption. In 1988, this portion of Route 20 became Route 19 as it did not connect with the other segment of the route. In the 1990s, Route 19 was extended to Main Street in downtown Paterson as part of a project that also completed the interchange with I-80.

== Route description ==

Route 19 begins at the intersection of [[County Route 509 (New Jersey)|County Route 509]] (Broad Street) and County Route 609 (Colfax Avenue) in [[Clifton, New Jersey|Clifton]]. From this intersection, it heads north [[concurrency (road)|concurrenct]] with County Route 509 as a four-lane [[divided highway]] with a {{convert|35|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} speed limit, soon interchanging with [[U.S. Route 46]].<ref name="sld"/><ref name=gm>{{google maps |url=http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&source=s_d&saddr=broad+street+and+colfax+avenue+clifton,+nj&daddr=route+19+and+main+street+paterson,+nj&geocode=&hl=en&mra=ls&sll=40.873578,-74.171748&sspn=0.014343,0.027466&ie=UTF8&t=h&z=13|title=overview of New Jersey Route 19 |accessdate=2009-06-17}}</ref> Past US 46, the road crosses a brook and County Route 509 (Broad Street) splits off, with Route 19 interchanging with the [[Garden State Parkway]].<ref name="sld"/> Route 19 continues past the Garden State Parkway as a six-lane {{convert|40|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} [[freeway]] surrounded by trees, coming to a northbound exit and southbound entrance with County Route 509.<ref name="sld"/><ref name=gm/>

Past this interchange, the speed limit increases to {{convert|55|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} and the road heads into [[Paterson, New Jersey|Paterson]]. Here, the route has a southbound exit and northbound entrance with County Route 621 (Valley Road) before becoming an eight-lane road and interchanging with [[Interstate 80 in New Jersey|Interstate 80]], where the speed limit drops to {{convert|50|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. Past I-80, the speed limit lowers to {{convert|40|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} and Route 19 continues north as a five-lane road, with three northbound lanes and two southbound lanes, to an interchange with County Route 638 (Grand Street).<ref name="sld"/> From here, the route becomes a four-lane divided surface road and heads into urbanized areas of downtown Paterson.<ref name="sld"/><ref name=gm/> The route turns east and becomes a {{convert|25|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} county-maintained undivided road at the intersection with Marshall Street and continues to its northern terminus at the intersection of County Route 509 (Main Street) and Ward Street.<ref name="sld"/>

==History==

[[File:Garden State Parkway northbound at NJ 19.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Exit 155P for Route 19 on northbound [[Garden State Parkway]]]]
What is now Route 19 was once planned as the Paterson spur of the [[Garden State Parkway]], which was to run through Paterson and [[Haledon, New Jersey|Haledon]] to [[County Route 504 (New Jersey)|County Route 504]] in [[Wayne, New Jersey|Wayne]].<ref name=nycroads>{{cite web|url=http://www.nycroads.com/roads/NJ-19/|title=NJ 19 Freeway|author=Anderson, Steve|publisher=Eastern Roads|accessdate=2009-03-11}}</ref> The planned Paterson spur would become an extension of [[New Jersey Route 20|Route 20]] in 1959.<ref name=nj1959>State of New Jersey, Laws of 1959, Chapter 4.</ref> This road, which was to be a six-lane, $58 million freeway called the Paterson Peripheral, was to run from Clifton north to the existing Route 20 in downtown Paterson.<ref name=nycroads/> This road was completed between the Garden State Parkway and Valley Road by 1969 and north to Interstate 80 in 1971.<ref name=nycroads/><ref name="chevron">{{cite map|publisher=[[Chevron Oil Company]]|title= Map of New Jersey |year=1969|cartography=[[H.M. Gousha]]}}</ref> Upon completion, this road received the Route 20 designation. The extension to Route 20 through Paterson was stopped in 1978 because of the designation of the [[Great Falls Historic District]], a historical district recognizing Paterson<U+2019>s heritage as an industrial center, and the number of homes and businesses that would be displaced by the route whether or not it ran through the historic district. In 1988, this portion of Route 20 was redesignated Route 19 as it did not connect with the mainline of the route. In 1992, a project to complete the interchange with I-80 and extend the route to Main Street in downtown Paterson to ease congestion was finished at a cost of $27 million.<ref name=nycroads/> This interchange received the Prize Bridge Award in the category of Grade Separation from Modern Steel Construction magazine in 1996.<ref name=msm>{{cite journal| year= 1996| month= October| title = 1996 Prize Bridge Award: Grade Separation - Route 19-Interstate 80 Interchange| journal = Modern Steel Construction| url =http://www.modernsteel.com/Uploads/Issues/October_1996/9610_12_route19interstate80.pdf| format = PDF| accessdate= 2009-07-23}}</ref>
