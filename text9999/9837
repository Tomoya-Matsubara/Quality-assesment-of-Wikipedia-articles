'''''The Gardner News''''' is a family-owned daily newspaper serving seven cities and towns in northwest [[Worcester County, Massachusetts]]. In addition to the city of [[Gardner, Massachusetts|Gardner]], where it is headquartered, it also covers the rural towns of [[Ashburnham, Massachusetts|Ashburnham]], [[Hubbardston, Massachusetts|Hubbardston]], [[Phillipston, Massachusetts|Phillipston]], [[Templeton, Massachusetts|Templeton]], [[Westminster, Massachusetts|Westminster]], and [[Winchendon, Massachusetts]].

''The News'' publishes every day except Sunday. It is noteworthy for printing on one of the widest newsprint "webs" in New England daily newspapering. Its text is also printed in a larger font size than usual. 

Its chief competitors are the county's two largest newspapers, the Fitchburg ''[[Sentinel & Enterprise]]'' and Worcester ''[[Telegram & Gazette]]''.

== History ==
=== Bell family ===
A family business since its founding as a weekly in 1869, ''The Gardner News'' has been a daily since  1897 and part of the Bell family since 1973, when C. Gordon Bell became president and publisher (he had been general manager of the company for a decade). During Gordon Bell's tenure as publisher, the newspaper modernized and was recognized as a leader among small New England dailies.<ref>"News Publisher C. Gordon Bell." Obituary. ''Telegram & Gazette'' (Worcester, Mass.), [[February 9]], [[1992]].</ref>

Upon Gordon Bell's death in 1992, his wife Alberta Bell became publisher of the newspaper where she had worked since 1986. 

=== The Leominster Times ===
During Alberta Bell's tenure as publisher, ''The Gardner News'' made one attempt at expanding its footprint, a six-month attempt in late [[1994]] to establish a new newspaper for [[Fitchburg, Massachusetts|Fitchburg]] and [[Leominster, Massachusetts]]. ''The Leominster Times'' was marketed as a general-interest newspaper, but Bell said she would make special efforts to cover minorities in Fitchburg and Leominster.<ref>King, Ernest.

Initially launched as a six-day daily newspaper (Monday through Saturday) in July 1994, ''The Times'' five months later cut back to a twice-weekly schedule and focused its coverage on Leominster only. Its [[January 6]], [[1995]] issue was its last.<ref>"Leominster Times." ''Telegram & Gazette'' (Worcester, Mass.), [[January 18]], [[1995]].</ref>
