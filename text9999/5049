'''William Ellery Sweet''' (January 27, 1869-May 9, 1942) was the [[List of Governors of Colorado|23rd]] [[Governor of Colorado|Governor]] of [[Colorado]] from 1923-1925.

== Early life and career ==
William was born in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]] on January 27, 1869 to Channing and Emeroy Sweet. His family moved to [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]] in 1872 when William was two. He attended school there, and graduated from high school in 1887. After high school, he went to college in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]] at [[Swarthmore College]]. He graduated from Swarthmore in 1890, after three years attending, and got his [[Bachelor Degree]].

On October 19, 1892, Sweet married Joyeuse L. Fullerton in Philadelphia. After their marriage, William moved to Denver. He decided to start up an [[investment banking]] [[business|firm]], which led the Sweet family to become wealthy, and even let William to retire in 1922. He donated much of his money to charities, including the Denver [[YMCA]].

It wasn't until 1922, that he became active in politics. He joined the Democratic Party, and he gained most of his support from the farm and labor groups. He was a strong advocate against the [[Ku Klux Klan]], which he believed why he lost the following election to [[Clarence Morley]], because they were a major influence on Colorado politics at the time.

Sweet made two unsuccessful attempts to run for the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] in 1926 and 1936.

In the final years of his life, William was a proud supporter of the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1924-46)|Progressive Party]], and even supported [[Herbert Hoover]]'s bid for [[President of the United States|President]].

He died on May 9, 1942 in his Denver home.
