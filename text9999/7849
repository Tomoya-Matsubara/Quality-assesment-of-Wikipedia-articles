The '''pound sterling''' (symbol: [[Pound sign|<U+00A3>]]; [[ISO 4217|ISO code]]: GBP), commonly called the '''pound''', is the official [[currency]] of the [[United Kingdom]], its [[Crown Dependencies]] (the [[Isle of Man]] and the [[Channel Islands]]) and the [[British Overseas Territories]] of [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/about-the-fco/country-profiles/south-america/south-georgia-south-sandwich |title=Foreign and Commonwealth Office country profiles: South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands |publisher=Fco.gov.uk |date=2007-09-06 |accessdate=2010-04-17}}</ref> [[British Antarctic Territory]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/about-the-fco/country-profiles/south-america/british-antarctic-territory |title=Foreign and Commonwealth Office country profiles: British Antarctic Territory |publisher=Fco.gov.uk |date=2010-03-25 |accessdate=2010-04-17}}</ref> and [[Tristan da Cunha]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travel-and-living-abroad/travel-advice-by-country/country-profile/south-america/tristan-da-cunha |title=Foreign and Commonwealth Office country profiles: Tristan da Cunha |publisher=Fco.gov.uk |date=2010-02-12 |accessdate=2010-04-17}}</ref> It is subdivided into 100 ''pence'' (singular: ''penny'').

The Channel Islands and the Isle of Man produce their own local issues of sterling; see [[Manx pound]], [[Jersey pound]], and [[Guernsey pound]]. The pound sterling is also used in [[Gibraltar]] (alongside the [[Gibraltar pound]]), the [[Falkland Islands]] (alongside the [[Falkland Islands pound]]) and [[Saint Helena]]<ref>[http://www.sthelenatourism.com/pages/fast_facts.html Fast Facts on St Helena], St Helena Tourism</ref> and [[Ascension Island|Ascension]]<ref>[http://www.ascension-island.gov.ac/aig/ascension-island-money.htm ascension-island.gov.ac], Ascension Island Currency</ref> (alongside the [[Saint Helena pound]]). The Gibraltar, Falkland Islands and Saint Helena pounds are separate currencies, pegged at parity to the pound sterling.

Sterling is the [[Foreign exchange market#Trading characteristics|fourth most traded]] currency in the [[foreign exchange market]], after the [[United States dollar|US dollar]], the [[euro]] and the [[Japanese yen]]. Together with those three currencies it forms the [[basket of currencies]] which [[Special Drawing Rights#Value|calculate the value]] of [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] [[Special Drawing Rights]], with a 11.3% weighting (the 3rd greatest) as of 2011. Sterling is also the third most held [[reserve currency]] in [[Foreign exchange reserves|global reserves]].

==Name==
The full, official name, pound sterling, ([[English plural#Plurals of compound nouns|plural]]: ''pounds sterling'') is used mainly in formal contexts and also when it is necessary to distinguish the  United Kingdom currency from [[pound (currency)|other currencies with the same name]]. Otherwise the term '''pound''' is normally used. The currency name is sometimes abbreviated to just '''sterling''', particularly in the wholesale financial markets, but not when referring to specific amounts; for example, "Payment is accepted in sterling" but never "These cost five sterling".<ref>This, as in the phrase "cinque sterline", would be the case in Italy, a country whose previous currency, the lira, derived from the Roman libra and was denoted by the same symbol.</ref><ref>In Ireland it is quite common to use terms such as this</ref>  The abbreviations "ster." or "stg." are sometimes used. The term '''British pound''' is commonly used in less formal contexts, although it is not an official name of the currency. A common slang term is '''quid''' (singular and plural) which is thought to derive from the Latin phrase "[[quid pro quo]]".{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

There is some uncertainty as to the origin of the term "pound sterling".  Some sources say it dates back to [[Anglo-Saxon]] times, when coins called sterlings were minted from silver; 240 of these sterlings weighed one pound, and large payments came to be made in "pounds of sterlings".<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9061103/pound-sterling Pound sterling], Encyclopaedia Britannica</ref>  Other references, including the Oxford English Dictionary, say a sterling was a silver penny used in England by the Normans, and date the term to around 1300.  For more discussion of the etymology of "sterling" see [[Sterling silver]].

The [[currency sign]] is the [[pound sign]].  The '''<U+00A3>''' is written with a single cross-bar<U+2014>this is the style used on sterling bank notes. The pound sign derives from the [[blackletter|black-letter]] "L", an abbreviation  of ''Librae'' in Roman [[<U+00A3>sd]] units (''librae, solidi, denarii'') used for pounds, shillings and pence in the British pre-decimal [[duodecimal]] currency system. [[Ancient Roman units of measurement|''Libra'']] was the basic Roman unit of weight, derived from the [[Latin]] word for [[Weighing scale|scales]] or balance.

The [[ISO 4217|ISO 4217 currency code]] is GBP. Occasionally, the abbreviation UKP is used but this is incorrect because the [[ISO 3166]] country code for (the United Kingdom of) Great Britain and Northern Ireland is GB (see [[Terminology of the British Isles#Terminology in detail]]). The [[Crown dependency|Crown dependencies]] use their own (non-ISO) codes: GGP ([[Guernsey pound]]), JEP ([[Jersey pound]]) and IMP ([[Isle of Man pound]]). Stocks are often traded in pence, so traders may refer to [[pence sterling]], GBX (sometimes GBp), when listing stock prices.

==Subdivisions and other units==
===Decimal Coinage===
Since [[decimalisation]] in 1971 (see [[Decimal Day]]), the pound has been divided into 100 pence (until 1981 described on the coinage as "new pence"). The symbol for the penny is "p"; hence an amount such as 50p (<U+00A3>0.50) properly pronounced "fifty pence" is more colloquially, quite often, pronounced "fifty pee". This also helped to distinguish between new and old pence amounts during the changeover to the decimal system.  Decimal halfpence were issued until 1984.

===Pre-decimal===
[[File:De Alice's Abenteuer im Wunderland Carroll pic 25.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Mad Hatter]]'s hat shows an example of the old pre-decimal system: the hat costs 10 shillings and 6 pence.]]
Prior to decimalisation, the pound was divided into 20 [[British shilling coin|shilling]]s and each shilling into 12 [[Old penny sterling|pence]], making 240 pence to the pound. The symbol for the shilling was "''s''."<U+2014>not from the first letter of the word, but from the Latin ''[[solidus (coin)|solidus]]''. The symbol for the penny was "''d''.", from the French ''denier''{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}, from the Latin ''[[denarius]]'' (the solidus and denarius were Roman coins). A mixed sum of shillings and pence such as 3 shillings and 6 pence was written as "3/6" or "3''s''. 6''d''." and spoken as "three and six". 5 shillings was written as "5''s''." or, more commonly, "5/-". The stroke (/) indicating shillings is also known as a solidus, and was originally an adaptation of the [[long s]] which represented that word.

Various coin denominations had, and in some cases continue to have, special names<U+2014>such as [[crown (British coin)|crown]], [[farthing (British coin)|farthing]], [[sovereign (British coin)|sovereign]] and [[guinea (British coin)|guinea]]. See [[Coins of the pound sterling]] and [[List of British bank notes and coins|List of British coins and banknotes]] for details.

By the 1950s, coins of George III, George IV and William IV  had disappeared from circulation, but coins (at least the penny) bearing the head of any British king or queen from [[Queen Victoria]] onwards could be found in circulation. Silver coins were replaced by those in cupro-nickel in 1947, and by the 1960s the silver coins were rarely seen. Silver/cupro-nickel shillings (from any period after 1816) and florins (2 shillings) remained as legal tender after decimalisation (as 5p and 10p respectively), and the sixpences of 1816 and after remained legal tender until 1980 (as two and a half new pence).

==History==
The pound sterling is the world's oldest currency still in use.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/bbc_parliament/7090665.stm BBC.co.uk] 'Economic terms explained' BBC News</ref>

===Anglo-Saxon===
{{Main|Anglo-Saxon pound}}
The origins of sterling lie in the reign of King [[Offa of Mercia]], (757<U+2013>796) who introduced the [[History of the English penny (c. 600<U+2013>1066)|silver penny]]. It copied the ''denarius'' of the new currency system of [[Charlemagne]]'s [[Frankish Empire]]. As in the Carolingian system, 240 pennies weighed 1 [[pound (mass)|pound]] (corresponding to Charlemagne's ''libra''), with the shilling corresponding to Charlemagne's ''solidus'' and equal to 12d. At the time of the penny's introduction, it weighed 22.5 troy [[grain (mass)|grains]] of fine silver (30 tower grains; about 1.5 g), indicating that the Mercian pound weighed 5,400 troy grains (the Mercian pound became the basis of the [[tower pound]], which weighed 5,400 troy grains, equivalent to 7,200 tower grains). At this time, the name sterling had yet to be acquired. The penny swiftly spread throughout the other Anglo-Saxon kingdoms and became the standard coin of what was to become England.

===Medieval===
The early pennies were struck from fine silver (as pure as was available). However, in 1158, a new coinage was introduced by King [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] (known as the ''Tealby penny'') which was struck from .925 (92.5%) silver. This became the standard until the 20th century and is today known as [[sterling silver]], named after its association with the currency. Sterling silver is harder than the fine silver (i.e. 0.999/99.9% pure, etc.) that was traditionally used and so sterling silver coins did not wear down as rapidly as fine silver coins. The English currency was almost exclusively silver until 1344, when the gold [[noble (English coin)|noble]] was successfully introduced into circulation. However, silver remained the legal basis for sterling until 1816. In the reign of [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]] (1399<U+2013>1413), the penny was reduced in weight to {{convert|15|gr}} of silver, with a further reduction to {{convert|12|gr}} in 1464.

===Tudor===
During the reigns of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] and [[Edward VI]], the silver coinage was drastically debased, although the pound was redefined to the [[troy pound]] of {{convert|5760|gr}} in 1526. In 1544, a silver coinage was issued containing just one third silver and two thirds copper<U+2014>equating to .333 silver, or 33.3% pure. The result was a coin copper in appearance, but relatively pale in colour. In 1552, a new silver coinage was introduced, struck in sterling silver. However, the penny's weight was reduced to {{convert|8|gr}}, meaning that 1 troy pound of sterling silver produced 60 shillings of coins. This silver standard was known as the "60-shilling standard" and lasted until 1601 when a "62-shilling standard" was introduced, reducing the penny's weight to 7 {{frac|23|31}} grains (0.50 g). Throughout this period, the size and value of the gold coinage fluctuated considerably.

===Unofficial gold standard===
In 1663, a new [[gold coinage]] was introduced based on the 22 [[carat (purity)|carat]] fine [[guinea (coin)|guinea]]. Fixed in weight at 44<U+00BD> to the [[troy pound]] from 1670, this coin's value varied considerably until 1717, when it was fixed at 21 shillings (21/-, 1.05 pounds).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/economics/currency.html |last=Bloy |first=Marjie |title=British Currency before 1971 |publisher=Victorianweb.org |date=2006-06-20 |accessdate=2010-12-28}}</ref> However, despite the efforts of  Sir [[Isaac Newton]], Master of the [[Royal Mint|Mint]], to reduce the guinea's value, this valuation overvalued gold relative to silver when compared to the valuations in other European countries. British merchants sent silver abroad in payments whilst goods for export were paid for with gold. As a consequence, silver flowed out of the country and gold flowed in, leading to a situation where Great Britain was effectively on a [[gold standard]]. In addition, a chronic shortage of silver coins developed.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

===Establishment of modern currency===
The [[Bank of England]] was formed in 1694, followed by the [[Bank of Scotland]] a year later. Both began to issue paper money.

===Currency of the United Kingdom===
The [[pound scots]] had begun equal to sterling but had suffered far higher devaluation until being pegged to sterling at a value of 12 pounds scots = 1 pound sterling. In 1707, the [[Kingdom of England]] and the [[Kingdom of Scotland]] merged to form the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]]. In accordance with the [[Treaty of Union]], the currency of the 'united kingdom' was sterling with the pound scots being replaced by sterling at the pegged value.

=== Gold standard ===
During the [[Napoleonic wars|Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars]], Bank of England notes were [[legal tender]] and their value floated relative to gold. The Bank also issued silver tokens to alleviate the shortage of silver coins. In 1816, the gold standard was adopted officially, with the silver standard reduced to 66 shillings (66/-, 3.3 pounds), rendering silver coins a "token" issue (i.e., not containing their value in precious metal).  In 1817, the [[sovereign (British coin)|sovereign]] was introduced.  Struck in 22-carat gold, it contained {{convert|113|gr}} of gold and replaced the guinea as the standard British gold coin without changing the gold standard.  In 1825, the [[Irish pound]], which had been pegged to sterling since 1801 at a rate of 13 Irish pounds  = 12 pounds sterling, was replaced, at the same rate, with sterling.

During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, many other countries adopted the gold standard.  As a consequence, conversion rates between different currencies could be determined simply from the respective gold standards.  The pound sterling was equal to 4.85 [[U.S. dollar]]s, 4.89 [[Canadian dollar]]s, 12.10 [[Dutch guilder]]s, 25.22 [[French franc]]s (or equivalent currencies in the [[Latin Monetary Union]]), 20.43 [[German gold mark|German Mark]]s or 24.02 [[Austro-Hungarian krone|Austro-Hungarian Krone]]s. Discussions took place following the [[International Monetary Conferences|International Monetary Conference of 1867]] in [[Paris]] concerning the possibility of the UK joining the Latin Monetary Union, and a [[Royal Commission]] on International Coinage examined the issues,<ref>[http://www.gold.org/value/reserve_asset/history/monetary_history/vol2/1868feb18.html Gold.org]</ref> resulting in a decision against joining monetary union.

The gold standard was suspended at the outbreak of the war in 1914, with Bank of England and Treasury notes becoming legal tender.  Prior to [[World War I]], the United Kingdom had one of the world's strongest economies, holding 40% of the world's overseas investments.  However, by the end of the war the country owed <U+00A3>850 million (<U+00A3>{{Formatprice|{{Inflation|UK|850000000|1918|{{CURRENTYEAR}}|r=-4}}}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}).{{Inflation-fn|UK}}, mostly to the United States, with interest costing the country some 40% of all government spending.  In an attempt to resume stability, a variation on the gold standard was reintroduced in 1925, under which the currency was fixed to gold at its pre-war peg, although people were only able to exchange their currency for gold bullion, rather than for coins.  This was abandoned on 21 September 1931, during the [[Great Depression]], and sterling suffered an initial devaluation of some 25%.<ref>''The Board of Trade Journal'', 7 January 1932</ref>

===Use in the Empire===
{{Main|Sterling Area}}
Sterling circulated in much of the [[British Empire]]. In some parts, it was used alongside local currencies. For example, the gold sovereign was legal tender in Canada despite the use of the [[Canadian dollar]]. Several colonies and dominions adopted the pound as their own currency. These included [[Australia]], [[Barbados]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://centralbank.org.bb/WEBCBB.nsf/webpage/580B8A7909CC2876042573650078A7A3?OpenDocument |title=The Central Bank of Barbados: Students' Centre <U+2013> Money: Bits and Pieces |publisher=Centralbank.org.bb |date= |accessdate=2010-04-17}}</ref> [[British West Africa]], [[Cyprus]], [[Fiji]], [[Irish Free State]], [[Jamaica]], [[New Zealand]], [[South Africa]] and [[Southern Rhodesia]]. Some of these retained parity with sterling throughout their existence (e.g. the [[South African pound]]), whilst others deviated from parity after the end of the gold standard (e.g. the [[Australian pound]]). These currencies and others tied to sterling constituted the [[Sterling Area]].

===Bretton Woods===
{{see also|Economic history of the United Kingdom#1945<U+2013>1959: the post-War era|l1=Economic history of the UK, 1945<U+2013>59}}
In 1940, an agreement with the U.S.A. pegged the pound to the [[United States dollar|U.S. dollar]] at a rate of <U+00A3>1 = $4.03. This rate was maintained through the [[World War II|Second World War]] and became part of the [[Bretton Woods system]] which governed post-war exchange rates. Under continuing economic pressure, and despite months of denials that it would do so, on 19 September 1949 the government devalued the pound by 30.5% to $2.80. The move prompted several other currencies to be devalued against the dollar.

In the mid-1960s, the pound came under renewed pressure since the exchange rate against the dollar was considered too high. In the summer of 1966, with the value of the pound falling in the currency markets, exchange controls were tightened by the [[Harold Wilson|Wilson]] government. Among the measures, tourists were banned from taking more than <U+00A3>50 out of the country, until the restriction was lifted in 1979. The pound was eventually devalued by 14.3% to $2.40 on 18 November 1967.

===Decimalisation===
{{Main|Decimal Day}}
On 15 February 1971, the UK decimalised, replacing the shilling and penny with a single subdivision, the new penny. The word "new" was omitted from coins after 1981.

===Free-floating pound===
With the breakdown of the [[Bretton Woods system]], the pound [[floating currency|floated]] from August 1971 onwards.  It at first appreciated a little, rising to almost $2.65 in March 1972, from 2.42 when it had been fixed.  The [[Sterling Area]] effectively ended at this time when the majority of its members also chose to float freely against the pound and the dollar.

===The 1976 sterling crisis ===
[[James Callaghan]] came to power in 1976. He was immediately told the economy was facing huge problems, according to documents released in 2006 by the [[National Archives]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Casciani |first=Dominic |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6212557.stm |title=BBC |publisher=BBC News |date=2006-12-29 |accessdate=2010-04-17}}</ref> The effects of the [[1973 oil crisis]] were still being felt, with inflation rising to over 27% in 1975.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/cabinetpapers/themes/global-oil-shortage.htm |title=The Cabinet Papers - Global oil shortage |accessdate=2010-12-22}}</ref>  Financial markets were beginning to believe the pound was overvalued and in April of that year the The Wall Street Journal advised the sale of sterling investments in a story titled "Good-bye Great Britain". At the time the UK government was running a budget deficit and Labour's strategy emphasised high public spending. Callaghan was told there were three possible outcomes: a disastrous free fall in Sterling, an internationally unacceptable siege economy or a deal with key allies to prop up the pound while painful economic reforms were put in place. The US government feared the crisis could endanger NATO and the EEC and in light of this the US Treasury set out to force domestic policy changes. In November 1976 the IMF announced the conditions for a loan included deep cuts in public expenditure.<ref>"Good-bye Great Britain": 1976 IMF Crisis, K Burk, ISBN 0-300-05728-8</ref>

===1979<U+2013>1989===
The Conservatives arrived in power in 1979, on a programme of fiscal austerity. Initially, the pound rocketed, moving above the $2.40 level, as interest rates rose in response to the [[monetarist]] policy of targeting [[money supply]]. The high exchange rate was widely blamed for the deep [[recession]] of 1981. Sterling fell sharply after 1980; at its lowest, the pound stood at just $1.03 in March 1985, before returning to the US$1.70 level in December 1989.

===Following the Deutsche Mark===
In 1988, [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[Nigel Lawson]] decided that the pound should "shadow" the West German [[Deutsche Mark]], with the unintended result of a rapid rise in inflation as the economy boomed due to inappropriately low interest rates.  (For ideological reasons, the Conservative Government declined to use alternative mechanisms to control the explosion of credit.  For this reason, former Prime Minister [[Edward Heath]] referred to Lawson as a "one club golfer").<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2003/oct/26/politics.economicpolicy Sometimes it can pay to break the rules]  Victor Keegan (Economics Editor) The Observer</ref>

Following German re-unification in 1989, the reverse held true, as high borrowing costs to fund Eastern reconstruction, a need exacerbated by the political choice to make the ostmark equivalent to the deutschemark, meant rates in other countries shadowing the DM, especially the UK, were far too high relative to domestic circumstances, leading to a housing decline and recession.

=== Following the European Currency Unit ===
On 8 October 1990 the Conservative government decided to join the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism]] (ERM), with the pound set at [[Deutsche Mark|DM]]2.95.  However, the country was forced to withdraw from the system on <U+201C>[[Black Wednesday]]<U+201D> (16 September 1992) as Britain<U+2019>s economic performance made the exchange rate unsustainable.  Speculator [[George Soros]] famously made approximately US$1 billion from [[short (finance)|shorting]] the pound.

'Black Wednesday' saw interest rates jump from 10% to 15% in an unsuccessful attempt to stop the pound from falling below the ERM limits.  The exchange rate fell to [[Deutsche Mark|DM]]2.20.  Proponents{{Who|date=December 2009}} of a lower GBP/DM exchange rate were vindicated as the cheaper pound encouraged exports and contributed to the economic prosperity of the 1990s.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

=== Following inflation targets ===
In 1997, the newly elected [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government handed over day-to-day control of interest rates to the [[Bank of England]] (a policy that had originally been advocated by the [[Liberal Democrats]]{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}).  The Bank is now responsible for setting its base rate of interest so as to keep inflation in the [[Consumer Price Index (United Kingdom)|Consumer Price Index]] (CPI) very close to 2%.  Should CPI inflation be more than one percentage point above or below the target, the governor of the Bank of England is required to write an open letter to the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] explaining the reasons for this and the measures which will be taken to bring this measure of inflation back in line with the 2% target.  On 17 April 2007, CPI inflation was reported at 3.1% (inflation of the [[Retail Prices Index (United Kingdom)|Retail Prices Index]] was 4.8%).  Accordingly, and for the first time, the Governor had to write publicly to the government explaining why inflation was more than one percentage point higher than its target.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/6562723.stm |title=Business &#124; Rate hike fear as inflation jumps |publisher=BBC News |date=2007-04-17 |accessdate=2010-04-17}}</ref>

===Euro===
{{Main|United Kingdom and the euro}}
As a member of the [[European Union]], the United Kingdom could adopt the [[euro]] as its currency. However, the subject remains politically controversial. Gordon Brown, then [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], ruled out membership for the foreseeable future, saying that the decision not to join had been right for Britain and for Europe.<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article2127640.ece Puritanism comes too naturally for 'Huck' Brown]<U+2014>Times Online</ref>

The government of former Prime Minister Tony Blair had pledged to hold a public referendum to decide on membership should "[[five economic tests]]" be met, to ensure that adoption of the euro would be in the national interest. In addition to these internal (national) criteria, the UK would have to meet the [[European Union|EU's]] economic [[convergence criteria]] (Maastricht criteria), before being allowed to adopt the euro. The Conservative/Liberal Democrat coalition ruled out joining the euro for the parliamentary term. Currently, the UK's annual [[deficit|government deficit]], as a percentage of the [[gross domestic product|GDP]], is above the defined threshold. In February 2005, 55% of British citizens were against adopting the currency, with 30% in favour.<ref>{{cite web |date=2005-02-28 |url=http://www.mori.com/polls/2005/citigroup-feb.shtml |title=EMU Entry And EU Constitution |publisher=MORI}}</ref> The idea of replacing the pound with the euro has been controversial with the British public, partly because of the pound's identity as a symbol of British sovereignty<ref>[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/global/main.jhtml?xml=/global/2003/05/12/hairaq101.xml Should Britain join the euro? <U+2013> Telegraph]{{dead link|date=April 2010}}</ref> and because it would, according to critics, lead to suboptimal interest rates, harming the British economy. In December 2008 the results of a BBC poll of 1000 people suggested that 71% would vote no, 23% would vote yes to joining the European single currency, while 6% said they were unsure.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7806936.stm |title=Most Britons 'still oppose euro' |publisher=BBC News |date=2009-01-01 |accessdate=2010-04-17}}</ref>
The pound did not join the Second European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM II) after the euro was created. Denmark and the UK have opt-outs from entry to the euro. Technically, every other EU nation must eventually sign up.

The [[Scottish Conservative Party]] claims that there is an issue for Scotland in that the adoption of the euro would mean the end of regionally distinctive banknotes, as the euro banknotes do not have national designs.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/755013.stm |title=SCOTLAND &#124; Protesters pursue Hague |publisher=BBC News |date=2000-05-19 |accessdate=2010-04-17}}</ref> The [[Scottish National Party]] claims an independent Scotland would have nationally distinctive coins, and its [[Scottish National Party#Policy platform|party policy]] includes entry into the single currency.

On 1 January 2008 the British sovereign bases on Cyprus ([[Akrotiri and Dhekelia]]) began using the euro (along with the rest of the [[Cyprus|Republic of Cyprus]]).<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article3097521.ece Euro reaches field that is for ever England <U+2013> The Times]{{dead link|date=April 2010}}</ref>

===Current exchange value===
{{Main|Economy of the United Kingdom#Exchange rates}}
The pound and euro fluctuate in value against one another, although there may be correlation between movements in their respective exchange rates with other currencies such as the US dollar. Inflation concerns in the UK led the Bank of England to raise interest rates in late 2006 and 2007.  This caused the pound to appreciate against other major currencies, and with the US dollar depreciating at the same time, the pound hit a 15-year high against the US dollar on 18 April 2007, having reached US$2 for the first time since 1992 the day before.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6566715.stm |title=Business &#124; Pound reaches 26-year dollar high |publisher=BBC News |date=2007-04-18 |accessdate=2010-04-17}}</ref> The pound and many other currencies continued to appreciate against the dollar, and sterling hit a 26-year high of US$2.1161 on 7 November 2007 as the dollar fell worldwide. From mid-2003 to mid 2007, the pound/euro rate remained rangebound (within <U+00B1> 5%) of <U+20AC>1.45.<ref>[http://www.oanda.com/products/fxgraph/fxgraph.shtml FXGraph: Graphical Display of Currency Rates] OANDA.COM</ref> However, following the [[global financial crisis of 2008<U+2013>2009|global financial crisis]] in late 2008, the pound has since depreciated at one of the fastest rates in history, reaching a 24-year low of $1.35 per <U+00A3>1 on 23 January 2009<ref>{{cite web|url=http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=GBPUSD=X&t=3m&l=on&z=m&q=l&c= |title=GBPUSD=X: Basic Chart for GBP/USD - Yahoo!

The following months saw a steady decline, with the pound's current (November 2010) value at <U+20AC>1.18 and US$1.60.

On 5 March 2009, the [[Bank of England]] announced that they would pump <U+00A3>75 billion of new [[capital (economics)|capital]] into the [[Economy of the United Kingdom|British economy]], through a process known as [[quantitative easing]]. This is the first time in the United Kingdom's history that this measure has been used, although the Bank's [[Governor of the Bank of England|Governor]] [[Mervyn King (economist)|Mervyn King]] suggested it was not an experiment.<ref name=BBC>{{cite news |title=Bank to pump <U+00A3>75bn into economy |publisher=BBC News |date=2009-03-05 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7927100.stm |accessdate=2009-03-05}}</ref>

The process sees the Bank of England creating new money for itself, which it then uses to purchase [[assets]] such as [[government bonds]], [[bank loan]]s, or [[mortgages]].<ref name=CNN1>{{cite news |title=ECB, Bank of England cut rates to record lows  |publisher=CNN |date=2009-03-05 |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/BUSINESS/03/05/uk.interest.rate/index.html |accessdate=2009-03-05}}</ref> The initial amount stated to be created through this method was <U+00A3>75 billion, although [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[Alistair Darling]] had given permission for up to <U+00A3>150 billion to be created if necessary.<ref name=Times/> It is thought the process is likely to occur over a period of three months with results only likely in the long term.<ref name=BBC/> By 5 November 2009, some <U+00A3>175 billion had been injected using quantitative easing and the effectiveness of the process remains questionable.

The Bank of England has stated that the decision has been taken to prevent the rate of [[inflation]]
falling below the two percent target rate.<ref name=CNN1/> Mervyn King, the Governor of the Bank of England, also suggested there were no other monetary options left as [[interest rates]] have already been cut to their lowest level ever of 0.5% and it was unlikely they would be cut further.<ref name=Times>{{cite news |title=Bank <U+2018>prints<U+2019> <U+00A3>75bn and cuts interest rates in half |publisher=The Times |date=2009-03-05 |url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/economics/article5854896.ece |accessdate=2009-03-05 | location=London | first=Gary | last=Duncan}}</ref>

==Coins==
{{Main|Coins of the pound sterling}}
===Pre-decimal coins===
The silver penny (plural: ''pence''; abbreviation: ''d'') was the principal and often sole coin in circulation from the 8th century until 13th century. Although some fractions of the penny were struck (see [[farthing (British coin)|farthing]] and [[halfpenny (British coin)|halfpenny]]), it was more common to find pennies cut into halves and quarters to provide smaller change. Very few gold coins were struck, with the [[gold penny]] (worth 20 silver pence) a rare example. However, in 1279, the ''[[groat (coin)|groat]]'', worth 4d was introduced, with the half groat following in 1344. 1344 also saw the establishment of a gold coinage with the introduction (after the failed [[florin (English coin)|gold florin]]) of the [[noble (English coin)|''noble'']] worth six shillings and eight pence ('6/8') (i.e. 3 to the pound), together with the half and quarter noble. Reforms in 1464 saw a reduction in value of the coinage in both silver and gold, with the noble renamed the ''ryal'' and worth 10/- (i.e. 2 to the pound) and the [[angel (coin)|''angel'']] introduced at the noble's old value of 6/8.

The reign of [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] saw the introduction of two important coins, the [[shilling]] (abbr: ''s''; known as the ''testoon'') in 1487 and the pound (known as the [[sovereign (British coin)|''sovereign'']], abbr: ''<U+00A3>'' or ''L'') in 1489. In 1526, several new denominations of gold coins were added, including the ''[[crown (British coin)|crown]]'' and ''[[half crown (British coin)|half crown]]'' worth five shillings (''5/-''), and two shillings and six pence (''2/6'', ''two and six'') respectively. [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]'s reign (1509<U+2013>1547) saw a high level of [[debasement]] which continued into the reign of [[Edward VI]] (1547<U+2013>1553). However, this debasement was halted in 1552 and a new silver coinage was introduced, including coins for 1d, 2d, [[threepence (British coin)|3d]], 4d and [[sixpence (British coin)|6d]], 1/-, 2/6 and 5/-. The reign of [[Elizabeth I]] (1558<U+2013>1603) saw the addition of silver <U+00BE>d and 1<U+00BD>d coins, although these denominations did not last. Gold coins included the half crown, crown, angel, half sovereign and sovereign. Elizabeth's reign also saw the introduction of the horse-drawn screw press to produce the first "milled" coins.

Following the succession of the Scottish King [[James VI]] to the English throne, a new gold coinage was introduced, including the ''[[spur ryal]]'' (15/-), the ''[[unite (English coin)|unite]]'' (20/-) and the ''rose ryal'' (30/-). The ''[[laurel (English coin)|laurel]]'', worth 20/-, followed in 1619. The first base metal coins were also introduced, [[tin]] and [[copper]] [[farthing (British coin)|farthings]]. Copper [[halfpenny (British coin)|halfpenny]] coins followed in the reign of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]].  During the [[English Civil War]], a number of siege coinages were produced, often in unusual denominations.

Following the restoration of the monarchy in 1660, the coinage was reformed, with the ending of production of hammered coins in 1662. The ''[[guinea (British coin)|guinea]]'' was introduced in 1663, soon followed by the <U+00BD>, 2 and 5 guinea coins. The silver coinage consisted of denominations of 1d, 2d, 3d, 4d and 6d, 1/-, 2/6 and 5/-. Due to the widespread export of silver in the 18th century, the production of silver coins gradually came to a halt, with the half crown and crown not issued after the 1750s, the 6d pence and 1/- stopping production in the 1780s. One response was the introduction of the copper 1d and 2d coins and the gold <U+2153> guinea (7/-) in 1797. The copper penny was the only one of these coins to survive long.

To alleviate the shortage of silver coins, between 1797 and 1804, the Bank of England counterstamped [[Spanish dollar]]s (8 reales) and other [[Spanish real|Spanish]] and [[Spanish colonial real|Spanish colonial]] coins for circulation. A small counterstamp of the King's head was used. Until 1800, these circulated at a rate of 4/9 for 8 reales. After 1800, a rate of 5/- for 8 reales was used. The Bank then issued silver tokens for 5/- (struck over Spanish dollars) in 1804, followed by tokens for 1/6 and 3/- between 1811 and 1816.

In 1816, a new silver coinage was introduced in denominations of 6d, 1/-, 2/6 and 5/-. The crown was only issued intermittently until 1900. It was followed by a new gold coinage in 1817 consisting of 10/- and <U+00A3>1 coins, known as the half sovereign and [[sovereign (British coin)|sovereign]]. The silver 4d coin was reintroduced in 1836, followed by the 3d ("thruppence") in 1838, with the 4d coin issued only for colonial use after 1855. In 1848, the 2/- ''[[florin (British coin)|florin]]'' was introduced, followed by the short-lived [[double florin]] in 1887. In 1860, copper was replaced by bronze in the farthing (quarter penny, <U+00BC>d), halfpenny and penny.

During the [[First World War]], production of the half sovereign and sovereign was suspended and, although the gold standard was restored, the coins saw little circulation again. In 1920, the silver standard, maintained at .925 since 1552, was reduced to .500. In 1937, a nickel-brass 3d coin was introduced, with the last silver 3d coins issued seven years later. In 1947, the remaining silver coins were replaced with [[cupro-nickel]]. Inflation caused the farthing to cease production in 1956 and be demonetised in 1960. In the run-up to decimalisation, the halfpenny and half-crown were demonetised in 1969.

British coinage timeline:
*1968: The first [[coins of the pound sterling|decimal coins]] were introduced. These were [[cupro-nickel]] 5p and 10p coins which were equivalent to and circulated alongside the 1/- and 2/- coins.
*1969: The curved equilateral [[heptagon]]al [[cupro-nickel]] 50p coin replaced the 10/- note.
*1971: The decimal coinage was completed when decimalisation came into effect in 1971 with the introduction of the bronze <U+00BD>p, 1p and 2p coins and the withdrawal of the 1d and 3d coins.
*1980: Withdrawal of 6d coins, which had circulated at a value of 2<U+00BD>p.
*1982: The word "new" was dropped from the coinage and a 20p coin was introduced.
*1983: A <U+00A3>1 coin was introduced.
*1983: The <U+00BD>p coin was last produced.
*1984: The <U+00BD>p coin was [[wikt:demonetise|demonetise]]d
*1990s: The 5p, 10p and 50p coins became smaller.
*1991: The old 1/- coins, which had continued to circulate with a value of 5p, were demonetised in 1991 after the 5p coin became smaller.
*1992: [[Bronze]] was replaced with [[copper plating|copper-plated]] [[steel]]
*1993: The 2/- coins were similarly demonetised.
*1998: The [[bi-metallic coins|bi-metallic]] [[Two pounds (British decimal coin)#The modern circulating coin (1997<U+2013>present)|<U+00A3>2 coin]] was introduced.
*2007: By now the value of copper in the pre-1992 1p/2p coins (which are 97% copper) exceeded the value to such an extent that melting down the coins by [[entrepreneur]]s was becoming worthwhile (with a premium of up to 11%, with smelting costs reducing this to around 4%)<U+2014>although this is illegal, and the [[market value]] of copper has subsequently fallen dramatically from these earlier peaks.

At present, the oldest circulating coins in the U.K. are the 1p and 2p copper coins introduced in 1971. Before decimalisation, change could contain coins aged one hundred years or more, with any of five monarchs' heads on the obverse.

In April 2008 an extensive redesign of the coinage was unveiled. The new designs were issued gradually into circulation, starting in summer 2008. The new reverses of the 1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p and 50p coins feature parts of the [[Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom|Royal Shield]], and the new pound coin depicts the whole shield. The coins are of the same specifications as those with the old designs (which will continue to circulate).

==Banknotes==
{{Main|Banknotes of the pound sterling}}
[[Image:Bank Of England10.png|right|300px|thumb|<U+00A3>10 Series E Bank of England note.]]

The first sterling notes were issued by the [[Bank of England]] shortly after its foundation in 1694. Denominations were initially written on the notes at the time of issue. From 1745, the notes were printed in denominations between <U+00A3>20 and <U+00A3>1000, with any odd shillings added in hand. <U+00A3>10 notes were added in 1759, followed by <U+00A3>5 in 1793 and <U+00A3>1 and <U+00A3>2 in 1797. The lowest two denominations were withdrawn following the end of the [[Napoleonic wars]]. In 1855, the notes were converted to being entirely printed, with denominations of <U+00A3>5, <U+00A3>10, <U+00A3>20, <U+00A3>50, <U+00A3>100, <U+00A3>200, <U+00A3>300, <U+00A3>500 and <U+00A3>1000 issued.

[[Image:Bank of Scotland 20 pound note 2007.jpg|thumb|left|300px|A <U+00A3>20 note of the 2007 issue from the Bank Of Scotland]]

The [[Bank of Scotland]] began issuing notes in 1695. Although the [[pound scots]] was still the currency of Scotland, these notes were denominated in sterling in values up to <U+00A3>100. From 1727, the [[Royal Bank of Scotland]] also issued notes. Both banks issued some notes denominated in guineas as well as pounds. In the 19th century, regulations limited the smallest note issued by Scottish banks to be the <U+00A3>1 denomination, a note not permitted in England.

With the extension of sterling to Ireland in 1825, the [[Bank of Ireland]] began issuing sterling notes, later followed by other Irish banks. These notes included the unusual denominations of 30/- and <U+00A3>3. The highest denomination issued by the Irish banks was <U+00A3>100.

In 1826, banks at least {{convert|65|mi|km}} from London were given permission to issue their own paper money. From 1844, new banks were excluded from issuing notes in England and Wales but not in Scotland and Ireland. Consequently, the number of private banknotes dwindled in England and Wales but proliferated in Scotland and Ireland. The last English private banknotes were issued in 1921.

In 1914, the [[HM Treasury|Treasury]] introduced notes for 10/- and <U+00A3>1 to replace gold coins. These circulated until 1928, when they were replaced by Bank of England notes. Irish independence reduced the number of Irish banks issuing sterling notes to five operating in [[Northern Ireland]]. The [[Second World War]] had a drastic effect on the note production of the Bank of England. Fearful of mass forgery by the [[Nazi]]s (see [[Operation Bernhard]]), all notes for <U+00A3>10 and above ceased production, leaving the bank to issue only 10/-, <U+00A3>1 and <U+00A3>5 notes. Scottish and Northern Irish issues were unaffected, with issues in denominations of <U+00A3>1, <U+00A3>5, <U+00A3>10, <U+00A3>20, <U+00A3>50 and <U+00A3>100.

The Bank of England reintroduced <U+00A3>10 notes in 1964. In 1969, the 10/- note was replaced by the 50p coin as part of the preparation for decimalisation. <U+00A3>20 Bank of England notes were reintroduced in 1970, followed by <U+00A3>50 in 1982. Following the introduction of the <U+00A3>1 coin in 1983, Bank of England <U+00A3>1 notes were withdrawn in 1988. Scottish and Northern Irish banks followed, with only the Royal Bank of Scotland continuing to issue this denomination.

The <U+00A3>5 [[polymer banknote]], issued by [[Northern Bank]] in 2000, is the only polymer note currently in circulation, although Northern Bank also produces paper-based <U+00A3>10, <U+00A3>20 and <U+00A3>50 notes and, interestingly, notes named "titan". A titan is a <U+00A3>100,000,000 (One Hundred Thousand Pound) bank note, of which there are only 40 in existence. Titans are only used within the [[banking system]] and are unobtainable by the [[general public]].

[[Legal tender]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] means (according to the Royal Mint) "that a debtor cannot successfully be sued for non-payment if he pays into court in legal tender." It does not mean that any ordinary transaction has to take place in legal tender or only within the amount denominated by the legislation. Both parties are free to agree to accept any form of payment whether legal tender or otherwise according to their wishes. In order to comply with the very strict rules governing an actual legal tender it is necessary, for example, actually to offer the exact amount due because no change can be demanded.

Throughout the [[United Kingdom|UK]], <U+00A3>1 and <U+00A3>2 coins are legal tender for any amount, with the other coins being legal tender only for limited amounts. In [[England and Wales]], [[Bank of England]] notes are also legal tender for any amount. In Scotland and [[Northern Ireland]], no banknotes are currently legal tender, although Bank of England 10/- and <U+00A3>1 notes were legal tender, as were Scottish banknotes, during [[World War II]] (Currency (Defence) Act 1939; this status was withdrawn on 1 January 1946). However, the banks made deposits with the [[Bank of England]] to cover the bulk of their note issues. In the Channel Islands and Isle of Man, the local variations on the banknotes are legal tender in their respective jurisdictions.

'''Scottish, Northern Irish, Channel Islands and Manx notes''' can be used in the UK as a mean of payment. Guernsey, Jersey, the Isle of Man are in [[currency union]] with the United Kingdom and these currencies are not a separate currency from the English pound but are just a local issue of banknotes and coins denominated in '''pound sterling'''. However these notes are sometimes rejected by shops when used in England and Wales using fallacious arguments such as the classic "There is not the word 'Sterling' on it, we cannot accept it". Nowadays, the word "Sterling" does not mean anything and is often omitted on banknotes even on English notes. In fact, every single pound is sterling if pegged with the English pound which is the case for Scottish, Northern Irish, Jersey, Guernsey, Manx pound, Gibraltar pound, the Falkland Islands pound and Saint Helena pound.

It is legal for shopkeepers to choose to reject any payment (but not in their interest), even if it would be legal tender in that jurisdiction, because no debt exists when the offer of payment is made at the same time as the offer of goods or services. When settling a restaurant bill after consuming the meal, or settling another debt, the laws of legal tender do apply and the payment can not be rejected. But usually any reasonable method of settling the debt (such as by credit card) will be accepted.

Commemorative [[Five pounds (British decimal coin)|<U+00A3>5]] and [[British twenty-five pence coin|25p]] (crown) coins, rarely seen in circulation, are legal tender, as are the bullion coins issued by the Mint.

==Value==
In 2006 the [[House of Commons Library]] published a document<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/rp2006/rp06-009.pdf |title=New Research Paper 2005 template |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-04-17}}</ref> which included an index of the value of the pound for each year between 1750 and 2005, where the value in 1974 was indexed at 100. (This was an update of earlier documents published in 1998 and 2003.)

Regarding the period 1750<U+2013>1914 the document states: "Although there was considerable year on year fluctuation in price levels prior to 1914 (reflecting the quality of the harvest, wars, etc.) there was not the long-term steady increase in prices associated with the period since 1945". It goes on to say that "Since 1945 prices have risen in every year with an aggregate rise of over 27 times."

The value of the index in 1751 was 5.1, increasing to a peak of 16.3 in 1813 before declining very soon after the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] to around 10.0 and remaining in the range 8.5<U+2013>10.0 at the end of the nineteenth century. The index was 9.8 in 1914 and peaked at 25.3 in 1920, before declining to 15.8 in 1933 and 1934<U+2014>prices were only about three times as high as they had been 180 years earlier.<ref>[http://www.statistics.gov.uk/articles/economic_trends/ET604CPI1750.pdf 2003 article on price inflation] and [http://www.measuringworth.com/index.html see this]</ref>

[[Inflation]] had a dramatic effect during and after [[World War II]]<U+2014>the index was 20.2 in 1940, 33.0 in 1950, 49.1 in 1960, 73.1 in 1970, 263.7 in 1980, 497.5 in 1990, 671.8 in 2000 and 757.3 in 2005.

The following table shows the equivalent amount of goods that, in a particular year, could be purchased with <U+00A3>1.<ref>{{cite web| title = Measuring Worth - Purchasing Power of Money in the United Kingdom from 1971 to 2009 | url=http://www.measuringworth.com/ppowerus/ | accessdate = 2010-04-22}}</ref> The table shows that from 1971 through 2009 the British Pound has lost about 91% of its buying power.
