[[The Boat Race]] is a [[Rowing (sport)#Side by side|side-by-side rowing]] competition between the [[University of Oxford]] (sometimes referred to as the "Dark Blues")<ref name=blues>{{Cite web | url = http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2003/apr/06/theobserver | work = [[The Observer]] | title = Dark Blues aim to punch above their weight | date = 6 April 2003 | accessdate = 12 July 2014 }}</ref> and the [[University of Cambridge]] (sometimes referred to as the "Light Blues").<ref name=blues/>  First held in 1829, the race takes place on the {{convert|4.2|mi|km|adj=on}} [[The Championship Course|Championship Course]] on the [[River Thames]] in southwest London.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/uk/london/10719622/University-Boat-Race-2014-spectators-guide.html | work = [[The Daily Telegraph]] | accessdate = 12 July 2014 | date = 25 March 2014 |title = University Boat Race 2014: spectators' guide | first = Oliver |last =Smith}}</ref> The rivalry is a major point of honour between the two universities; it is followed throughout the United Kingdom and, as of 2014, broadcast worldwide.<ref name=CBC>{{cite news|title=Former Winnipegger in winning Oxford-Cambridge Boat Race crew|date=6 April 2014|publisher=CBC News|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/former-winnipegger-in-winning-oxford-cambridge-boat-race-crew-1.2600176|accessdate=9 July 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url = http://theboatraces.org/tv-and-radio | title = TV and radio | publisher = The Boat Race Company Limited | accessdate = 12 July 2014}}</ref>  Oxford went into the race as reigning champions, having won the [[The Boat Race 1952|1952 race]] by a canvas, with Cambridge leading overall with 53 victories to Oxford's 44 (excluding the [[The Boat Race 1877|"dead heat" of 1877]]).<ref name=results>{{Cite web | url = http://theboatraces.org/results| publisher =The Boat Race Company Limited | title = Boat Race <U+2013> Results| accessdate = 12 July 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url= http://theboatraces.org/classic-moments-the-1877-dead-heat | publisher = The Boat Race Company Limited | title = Classic moments <U+2013> the 1877 dead heat | accessdate = 12 July 2014}}</ref>

Cambridge were coached by [[James Crowden]] (who had represented Cambridge in the [[The Boat Race 1951|1951]] and [[The Boat Race 1952|1952 races]]), [[David Jennens]] (who rowed three times between 1949 and 1951), Roy Meldrum (a coach for [[Lady Margaret Boat Club]]) and R. H. H. Symonds (who had rowed in the [[The Boat Race 1931|1931 race]]).  Oxford's coaches were A. J. M. Durand (who had rowed for the Dark Blues in the [[The Boat Race 1920|1920 race]]), [[Hugh Edwards (rower)|Hugh "Jumbo" Edwards]] (who rowed for Oxford in [[The Boat Race 1926|1926]] and [[The Boat Race 1930|1930]]), R.

In the build-up to the race, opinions were divided on which crew was favourite to win.  According to the rowing correspondent of ''The Manchester Guardian'', upon arrival at Putney, Oxford demonstrated "great superiority" over Cambridge, yet the Light Blues had improved, and had "the pace, if not the form, to win".<ref>{{Cite news | title = Another tight finish likely | work = [[The Manchester Guardian]] | date = 28 March 1953 | page = 1}}</ref> ''The Times'' had declared "Oxford the stronger crew" on the day of the race.<ref name=prospects/>  [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]] had died four days prior to the race;<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/march/24/newsid_2785000/2785265.stm | title = 1953: Queen Mary dies peacefully after illness | publisher= BBC News | accessdate = 18 February 2015}}</ref> the coxes wore black armbands and the flag post on the umpire's [[Launch (boat)|launch]] was draped in black as marks of respect.

==Crews==
The Oxford crew weighed an average of 12&nbsp;[[Stone (unit)|st]] 13&nbsp;[[Pound (mass)|lb]] (81.9&nbsp;kg), {{convert|3|lb|kg|1}} per rower more than their opponents.  Cambridge saw two rowers return to their crew: J. S. M. Jones at number two and G. T. Marshall at number four.  Oxford's crew contained three rowers with Boat Race experience: A. J. Smith, M. L. Thomas and H. M. C. Quick.<ref name=burn77>Burnell, p. 77</ref>  Two of the participants in the race were registered as non-British: Oxford's Smith was Australian while Cambridge's L. B. McCagg was from the United States.<ref>Burnell, p. 39</ref>  The rowing correspondent for ''The Times'' described Oxford's crew as containing "no outstanding individuals" yet "no weak links".<ref name=prospects>{{Cite news | title = Prospects for today's Boat Race| work = [[The Times]] | page = 7 | date=28 March 1953 | issue = 52582}}</ref>  Conversely, Cambridge's crew was "variable" in quality but in former [[Harvard University]] rower Louis McCagg, they had the "outstanding oarsman in either crew".<ref name=prospects/>

==Race==
[[File:University Boat Race Thames map.svg|right|thumb|[[The Championship Course]] along which the Boat Race is contested]]
Cambridge won the [[coin flipping|toss]] and elected to start from the Surrey station, handing the Middlesex side of the river to Oxford.<ref name=alltheway>{{Cite news | work = [[The Observer]] | first = Ian | last=  Thomson | date = 29 March 1953 | page = 12 | title = Cambridge lead all the way}}</ref>  On a poor tide and in a strong south-westerly wind, umpire Ellison started the race at 12&nbsp;noon.<ref name=burn77/>  Both crews [[stroke rate|rated]] 36 for the first minute, after which the Light Blues held a quarter-length lead.  Passing [[Beverley Brook]], the bend in the river began to favour Oxford but Cambridge continued to pull away and were clear by a length as the crews passed the Mile Post.  They increased the lead by a further half-length as they passed the Crab Tree pub, and although Oxford made several bursts, they passed below [[Hammersmith Bridge]] six seconds behind the Light Blues,<ref name=alltheway/> and fell in behind them, the "first visible gesture of despair" according to ''The Manchester Guardian'''s rowing correspondent.<ref name=form>{{Cite news | title = Oxford keep their form but lose the Boat Race | work = [[The Manchester Guardian]] | date = 30 March 1953 | page = 9}}</ref>

Pushing away from the bridge, Oxford stayed in touch with Cambridge for a brief period, although could not reduce their lead.  Rowing into rough water towards [[Chiswick Eyot]], Cambridge moved across to seek shelter closer to the Surrey shore, while Oxford continued in the difficult conditions.  A lead of 14 seconds by Chiswick Steps was calmly extended to 20 seconds by the time the crews passed below [[Barnes Railway Bridge|Barnes Bridge]].<ref name=alltheway/>  Cambridge won by eight lengths in a time of 19 minutes 54 seconds, a time which "could have been shortened by at least half a minute had the winners been pressed".<ref name=form/>  It was their sixth victory in the past seven and the fastest winning time since the [[The Boat Race 1949|1949 race]].<ref name=results/>  The rowing correspondent for ''The Times'' described the result as a "spectacular reversal of form" having failed to show the pace they demonstrated in practice.<ref>{{Cite news | title = Form upset in Boat Race | work = [[The Times ]] | date = 30 March 1953 | page = 2 | issue = 52583}}</ref>
