'''Pskov''' ({{lang-ru|<U+041F><U+0441><U+043A><U+043E><U+0432>}}, ancient Russian spelling <U+041F><U+043B><U+044C><U+0441><U+043A><U+043E><U+0432><U+044A> ''Pleskov''), in Latvian ''Pleskava'', in Estonian [[Pihkva]], is an ancient [[types of inhabited localities in Russia|city]] located in the north-west of [[Russia]] about {{km to mi|20}} east from the [[Estonia]]n border, on the [[Velikaya River]]. The city of Pskov serves as the administrative center of [[Pskov Oblast]].  Population: {{ru-census|p2002=202780|p1989=203789}}

==Early history==
The name of the city, originally spelled "Pleskov", may be loosely translated as "the town of purling waters". Its earliest mention comes in 903, which records that [[Igor of Kiev]] married a local lady, [[Olga of Kiev|St.&nbsp;Olga]]. Pskovians sometimes take this year as the city's foundation date, and in 2003 a great jubilee took place to celebrate Pskov's 1,100th anniversary.

The first prince of Pskov was [[Vladimir I of Kiev|St. Vladimir]]'s younger son Sudislav. Once imprisoned by his brother [[Yaroslav I the Wise|Yaroslav]], he wasn't released until the latter's death several decades later. In the [[12th|12th century]] and 13th centuries, the town adhered politically to the [[Novgorod Republic]]. In 1241, it was taken by the [[Teutonic knights]], but [[Alexander Nevsky]] liberated it several months later during a legendary campaign dramatized in [[Sergei Eisenstein]]'s 1938 [[Alexander Nevsky (film)|movie]].

In order to secure their independence from the knights, the Pskovians elected a converted [[Lithuania]]n prince, named [[Daumantas of Pskov|Daumantas]] (known in Russian as Dovmont), as their military leader and prince in 1266. Having fortified the town, Daumantas routed the knights at [[Battle of Rakovor|Rakovor]] and overran much of Estonia. His remains and sword are preserved in the local [[kremlin]], and the core of the citadel, erected by him, still bears the name of "Dovmont's town".

==Pskov Republic==
{{Main|Pskov Republic}}

By the 14th century, the town functioned as the capital of a [[Pskov Feudal Republic|de-facto sovereign republic]]. Its most powerful force was the merchants who brought the town into the [[Hanseatic league]]. Pskov's independence was formally recognized by Novgorod in 1348. Several years later, the [[veche]] promulgated a law code (called the Pskov Charter) which was one of the principal sources of the [[Sudebnik|all-Russian law code]] issued in 1497.

For Russia, the [[Pskov Republic]] was a bridge towards [[Europe]]. For Europe, it was a western outpost of Russia and subject of numerous attacks throughout the history. Unbelievably, the kremlin (called by Pskovians the Krom) withstood 26&nbsp;sieges in the 15th century alone. At one point, five stone walls ringed it, making the city practically impregnable. A local school of [[icon]]-painting flourished, and local masons were considered the best in Russia. Many peculiar features of [[Russian architecture]] were first introduced in Pskov.

Finally, in 1510, the city fell to [[Muscovy|Muscovite]] forces. The deportation of noble families to [[Moscow]] is a subject of [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov|Rimsky-Korsakov]]'s [[opera]] ''[[The Maid of Pskov|Pskovityanka]]'' (1872). As the second largest city of Muscovy, Pskov still attracted enemy armies. Most famously, it withstood [[Siege of Pskov|a prolonged siege]] by 50,000-strong [[Poland|Polish]] army during the final stage of the [[Livonian War]] (1581<U+2013>1582). The king of Poland [[Stefan Batory]] undertook some 31&nbsp;attacks to storm the city, which was defended mainly by civilians. Even after one of the city walls was broken, the Pskovians managed to fill the gap and repel the attack. "It's amazing how the city reminds me of Paris", wrote one of the Frenchmen present at Batory's siege.

==Modern history==
[[Peter the Great]]'s conquest of [[Estonia]] and [[Latvia]] in the early 18th century spelled the end of Pskov's traditional role as a vital border fortress and a key to Russia's interior. As a consequence, the city's importance and well-being declined dramatically, although it has served as a capital of separate government since 1777. It was here that the last Russian [[tsar]] abdicated in [[February Revolution|March 1917]].

During [[World War I]], Pskov became the center of much activity behind the [[Front line|line]]s, and after the Russo-German [[Brest-Litovsk]] Peace Conference ([[December 22]], [[1917]]<U+2013>[[March 3]], [[1918]]), in the winter of 1917<U+2013>1918, the [[German Army (German Empire)|Imperial German Army]] invaded the area. Pskov also occupied by [[Estonian]] army between February 1919-July 1919 during [[Estonian War of Independence]].

The medieval citadel provided little protection against modern artillery, and during [[World War II]] Pskov suffered substantial damage during the [[Nazi Germany|German]] occupation from [[July 9]], [[1941]] until [[July 23]], [[1944]].  Many ancient buildings, particularly churches, suffered destruction before the [[Wehrmacht]] could occupy the city.  Though a huge portion of the population died during the war, Pskov has since struggled to regain its traditional position as a major industrial and cultural centre of Western Russia.

==Landmarks and sights==
Pskov still preserves much of its medieval walls, built from the 13th century on. The Krom, or medieval [[citadel]], looks as impressive as ever. Within its walls rises the 256-foot-tall [[Trinity Cathedral in Pskov|Trinity Cathedral]], founded in 1138 and rebuilt in the 1690s. The cathedral contains the tombs of saint princes [[Vsevolod of Pskov|Vsevolod]] (died in 1138) and [[Dovmont]] (died in 1299). Other ancient cathedrals adorn the Mirozhsky abbey (completed by 1152), St.&nbsp;John's (completed by 1243), and the [[Snetogorsky monastery]] (built in 1310 and painted in 1313).

Pskov is exceedingly rich in tiny, squat, picturesque churches, dating mainly from the 15th and the 16th centuries. There are many dozens of them, the most notable being St.&nbsp;Basil's on the Hill (1413), St.&nbsp;Kozma and Demian's near the Bridge (1463), St.&nbsp;George's from the Downhill (1494), Assumption from the Ferryside (1444, 1521), and St.&nbsp;Nicholas' from Usokha (1536). The 17th-century residential architecture is represented by merchant [[mansion]]s, such as the Salt House, the Pogankin chambers, and the Trubinsky mansion.

Among the sights in the vicinity of Pskov are [[Izborsk]], a seat of [[Rurik]]'s brother in the 9th century and one of the most formidable fortresses of medieval Russia; the [[Pskov Monastery of the Caves]], the oldest continually functioning monastery in Russia and a magnet for pilgrims from all over the country; the 16th-century [[Krypetsky Monastery]]; [[Elizarovo Monastery]], which used to be a great cultural and literary centre of medieval Russia; and [[Mikhailovskoe]], a family nest of [[Alexander Pushkin]] where he wrote some of the best known lines in the [[Russian language]]. The national poet of Russia is buried in the ancient cloister at the Holy Mountains nearby. Unfortunately, the area presently has only a very minimal [[tourist]] [[infrastructure]], and the historic core of Pskov requires serious investments to realize its great tourist potential.

Pskov is served by [[Pskov Airport]] which was also used for military aviation.
