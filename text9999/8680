Located in the [[Pacific Ocean]], it lies to the east of the [[Sea of Japan]], [[China]], [[North Korea]], [[South Korea]] and [[Russia]], stretching from the [[Sea of Okhotsk]] in the north to the [[East China Sea]] and [[Taiwan]] in the south. The [[Kanji|characters]] that make up Japan's name mean "sun-origin", which is why Japan is sometimes referred to as the "[[Names of Japan|Land of the Rising Sun]]".

Japan is an [[archipelago]] of [[List of islands of Japan|6,852 islands]]. The four largest islands are [[Honshu]], [[Hokkaido]], [[Kyushu]] and [[Shikoku]]. Together, these four islands hold about 97 percent of Japan's land area. Japan has the world's [[List of countries by population|tenth-largest population]], with more than 126&nbsp;million people. Honsh<U+016B>'s [[Greater Tokyo Area]], includes the [[Capital of Japan|''de facto'' capital city]] of [[Tokyo]] and several surrounding [[Prefectures of Japan|prefectures]]. It is the [[World's largest cities|largest metropolitan area]] in the world, with more than 30 million residents.

Archaeological research indicates that people lived in Japan as early as the [[Upper Paleolithic]] period. The first written mention of Japan is found in [[History of China|Chinese texts]] from the 1st century&nbsp;AD. Influence from other nations followed by long periods of isolation has characterized [[History of Japan|Japan's history]]. Japan evolved into a cohesive society during the [[Heian period]] (8th-11th centuries AD). From the 12th century until 1868, Japan was ruled by successive feudal military dictatorships or shogunates in the name of the Emperor. In the early 17th century, Japan entered into a long period of isolation, which was only ended in 1853 when a United States fleet pressured Japan to open to the West. Nearly two decades of internal conflict and insurrection followed before the [[Emperor Meiji|Meiji Emperor]] was restored as head of state in 1868 and the [[Empire of Japan]] was proclaimed, with the Emperor enshrined as a divine symbol of the nation. 

Periodic insurrections and civil disturbances continued into the 1880s. A modern constitution was promulgated in 1889 and a Western-style [[Diet of Japan|parliament]] established. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, victories in the [[First Sino-Japanese War]], the [[Russo-Japanese War]] and [[World War I]] allowed Japan to expand its empire during a period of increasing militarism. From 1931, military expansion into China and Manchuria led to the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] in 1937. Japan allied itself with the [[Axis powers]] in 1940, and the war in China became part of [[World War II]] in 1941. Successive military defeats and the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] led to the end of the war in 1945, Japan's surrender and the loss of its empire. Under Allied military occupation lasting until 1952, Japan dissolved and restructured its military, adopted a revised [[Constitution of Japan|constitution]] in 1947 and became a unitary [[constitutional monarchy]] with an [[Emperor of Japan|emperor]] and a democratically elected legislature.

==Etymology==<!--linked-->
{{Main|Names of Japan}}

The English word ''Japan'' derives from the Chinese pronunciation of the Japanese name, {{nihongo2|<U+65E5><U+672C>}} <!--(''Jipan'') This is NOT the standard Chinese pronunciation of these characters (which is ri4ben3); clarification needed-->, which in Japanese is pronounced ''Nippon'' {{Audio|ja-nippon(<U+65E5><U+672C>).ogg|listen}} or ''Nihon'' {{Audio|ja-nihon(<U+65E5><U+672C>).ogg|listen}}. The pronunciation ''Nippon'' is more formal, and is in Japanese used for most official purposes, including international sporting events.

From the [[Meiji Restoration]] until the end of [[World War II]], the full title of Japan was {{nihongo|''Dai Nippon Teikoku''|<U+5927><U+65E5><U+672C><U+5E1D><U+570B>}}, meaning "the [[Empire of Japan|Empire of Great Japan]]". Today the name {{Nihongo|''Nippon-koku'' or ''Nihon-koku''|<U+65E5><U+672C><U+56FD>}} is used as a formal modern-day equivalent; countries like Japan whose long form does not contain a descriptive designation are generally given a name appended by the character {{nihongo|''koku''|<U+56FD>}}, meaning "country", "nation" or "state".

[[Japanese people]] refer to themselves as {{Nihongo|''Nihonjin''|<U+65E5><U+672C><U+4EBA>}} and to their language as {{Nihongo|''Nihongo''|<U+65E5><U+672C><U+8A9E>}}. Both ''Nippon'' and ''Nihon'' mean "sun-origin" and are often translated as ''Land of the Rising Sun''. This nomenclature comes from [[Japanese missions to Imperial China]] and refers to Japan's eastward position relative to China. Before ''Nihon'' came into official use, Japan was known as {{Nihongo||<U+502D>|[[Wa (Japan)|Wa]]}} or {{Nihongo||<U+502D><U+56FD>|Wakoku}}.<ref>{{cite book|title=The emergence of Japanese kingship|first=Joan R. |last=Piggott|year=1997|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=0-8047-2832-1|pages=143<U+2013>144}}</ref>

The English word for Japan came to the West via [[Nanban trade|early trade routes]]. The [[Old Mandarin]] or possibly early [[Wu Chinese]] (<U+5433><U+8A9E>) pronunciation of Japan was recorded by [[Marco Polo]] as ''Cipangu''. In modern [[Shanghainese]], a Wu dialect, the pronunciation of characters {{nihongo2|<U+65E5><U+672C>}} 'Japan' is ''Zeppen'' {{IPA-wuu|z<U+0259><U+0294>p<U+0259>n|}}. The old [[Malay language|Malay]] word for Japan, ''Jepang'', was borrowed from a southern coastal Chinese dialect, probably [[Hokkien|Fukienese]] or [[Ningbo dialect|Ningpo]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Boxer|first=Charles Ralph|title=The Christian century in Japan 1549-1650|year=1951|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=1-85754-035-2|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=2R4DA2lip9gC&lpg=PP1&dq=The%20Christian%20Century%20In%20Japan%201549%E2%80%931650&pg=PA1#v=onepage&q=japang&f=false|pages=1<U+2013>14|quote=As for the name Japan, which with [[Fern<U+00E3>o Pires de Andrade|Pires]] enters the European history for the first time in this form, it is generally agreed to be derived, through Malay ''Japun'' or ''Japang'' from the Chinese ''Jihpenkuo'' in one or other of its coastal dialect forms, probably Fukienese or Ningpo. The meaning is literally "sun's origin country," whence Marco Polo derived his ''Chipangu'' that so fired the imagination of Columbus and led him to the discovery of the New World.<sup>10</sup>}}</ref> and this Malay word was encountered by [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] traders in [[Portuguese Malacca|Malacca]] in the 16th century.

The [[Nara period]] (710<U+2013>784) of the 8th century marked the emergence of a strong Japanese state, centered on an imperial court in [[Heij<U+014D> Palace|Heij<U+014D>-ky<U+014D>]] (modern [[Nara, Nara|Nara]]). The Nara period is characterized by the appearance of a nascent [[Japanese literature|literature]] as well as the development of Buddhist-inspired art and [[Historic Monuments of Ancient Nara|architecture]].<ref>{{cite book |first=Conrad|last=Totman |year=2002 |title=A History of Japan |publisher=Blackwell |pages=64<U+2013>79 | isbn=978-1-4051-2359-4}}</ref> The [[smallpox]] epidemic of 735<U+2013>737 is believed to have killed as much as one-third of Japan's population.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hays|first=J.N.|title=Epidemics and pandemics: their impacts on human history|year=2005|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|isbn=1-85109-658-2|page=31}}</ref> In 784, [[Emperor Kammu]] moved the capital from Nara to [[Nagaoka-ky<U+014D>]] before relocating it to [[Heian-ky<U+014D>]] (modern [[Kyoto]]) in 794.

This marked the beginning of the [[Heian period]] (794<U+2013>1185), during which a distinctly indigenous Japanese culture emerged, noted for its [[Japanese art|art]], [[Japanese poetry|poetry]] and prose. [[Murasaki Shikibu|Lady Murasaki's]] ''[[The Tale of Genji]]'' and the lyrics of Japan's national anthem ''[[Kimigayo]]'' were written during this time.<ref>{{cite book |first=Conrad|last=Totman |year=2002 |title=A History of Japan |publisher=Blackwell |pages=79<U+2013>87, 122<U+2013>123 | isbn=978-1-4051-2359-4}}</ref>

Buddhism began to spread during the Heian era chiefly through two major sects, [[Tendai]] by [[Saich<U+014D>]], and [[Shingon]] by [[K<U+016B>kai]]. [[Pure Land Buddhism]] ([[J<U+014D>do-sh<U+016B>]], [[J<U+014D>do Shinsh<U+016B>]]) greatly becomes popular in the latter half of the 11th century.

===Feudal era===
Japan's feudal era was characterized by the emergence and dominance of a ruling class of warriors, the [[samurai]]. In 1185, following the defeat of the [[Taira clan]] in the [[Genpei war]], sung in the epic [[The Tale of the Heike|Tale of Heike]], samurai [[Minamoto no Yoritomo]] was appointed [[shogun]] and established a base of power in [[Kamakura, Kanagawa|Kamakura]]. After his death, the [[H<U+014D>j<U+014D> clan]] came to power as regents for the shoguns. The [[Zen]] school of Buddhism was introduced from China in the [[Kamakura period]] (1185<U+2013>1333) and became popular among the samurai class.<ref>{{cite book|last=Totman|first=Conrad|title=A History of Japan ''(2nd ed.)''|year=2005|publisher=Blackwell|isbn=1-4051-2359-1|pages=106<U+2013>112}}</ref> The [[Kamakura shogunate]] repelled [[Mongol invasions of Japan|Mongol invasions]] in 1274 and 1281, but was eventually [[Kenmu Restoration|overthrown by Emperor Go-Daigo]]. Go-Daigo was himself defeated by [[Ashikaga Takauji]] in 1336.

Ashikaga Takauji established the shogunate in Muromachi, [[Kyoto, Kyoto|Kyoto]]. This was the start of the [[Muromachi Period]] (1336<U+2013>1573). The [[Ashikaga shogunate]] achieved glory in the age of [[Ashikaga Yoshimitsu]], and the culture based on Zen Buddhism (art of ''[[Miyabi]]'') prospered. This evolved to [[Higashiyama period|Higashiyama Culture]], and prospered until the 16th century. On the other hand, the succeeding Ashikaga shogunate failed to control the feudal warlords (''[[daimyo]]''), and a civil war (the [[<U+014C>nin War]]) began in 1467, opening the century-long [[Sengoku period]] ("Warring States").<ref>{{cite book |first=George|last=Sansom |year=1961 |title=A History of Japan: 1334<U+2013>1615 |publisher=Stanford University Press|pages=42, 217 | isbn=0-8047-0525-9}}</ref>

During the 16th century, traders and [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] [[missionary|missionaries]] from [[Portugal]] reached Japan for the first time, initiating direct [[Nanban trade|commercial]] and [[Nanban art|cultural]] exchange between Japan and the West. [[Oda Nobunaga]] conquered many other daimyo using European technology and firearms; after he was assassinated in 1582, his successor [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] unified the nation in 1590. Hideyoshi [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592<U+2013>1598)|invaded Korea twice]], but following defeats by Korean and [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] Chinese forces and Hideyoshi's death, Japanese troops were withdrawn in 1598.<ref>{{cite book |first=Stephen|last=Turnbull|year=2002 |title=Samurai Invasion: Japan's Korean War |publisher=Cassel |page=227| isbn=978-0-304-35948-6}}</ref> This age is called [[Azuchi<U+2013>Momoyama period]] (1573<U+2013>1603).

[[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] served as regent for Hideyoshi's [[Toyotomi Hideyori|son]] and used his position to gain political and military support. When open war broke out, he defeated rival clans in the [[Battle of Sekigahara]] in 1600.

===Modern era===
On 31 March 1854, [[Matthew C. Perry|Commodore Matthew Perry]] and the "[[Black Ships]]" of the [[United States Navy]] forced the opening of Japan to the outside world with the [[Convention of Kanagawa]]. Subsequent similar treaties with Western countries in the [[Bakumatsu]] period brought economic and political crises. The resignation of the shogun led to the [[Boshin War]] and the establishment of a [[Abolition of the han system|centralized state]] nominally unified under the Emperor (the [[Meiji Restoration]]).<ref>{{cite book|last=Totman|first=Conrad|title=A History of Japan ''(2nd ed.)''|year=2005|publisher=Blackwell|isbn=1-4051-2359-1|pages=289<U+2013>296}}</ref>

==Government and politics==
[[File:Akihito 090710-1600a.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Akihito|Emperor Akihito]] and [[Empress Michiko]]]]

Japan is a [[constitutional monarchy]] where the power of the [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]] is very limited. As a ceremonial figurehead, he is defined by the [[Constitution of Japan|constitution]] as "the symbol of the state and of the unity of the people." Power is held chiefly by the [[Prime Minister of Japan]] and other elected members of the Diet, while sovereignty is vested in the Japanese people.<ref name="Constitution">{{cite web |url=http://www.sangiin.go.jp/eng/law/index.htm |title=The Constitution of Japan |publisher=House of Councillors of the National Diet of Japan |date=3 November 1946 |accessdate=10 March 2007}}</ref> [[Akihito]] is the current Emperor of Japan; [[Crown Prince Naruhito|Naruhito, Crown Prince of Japan]], stands as next in line to the throne.

Japan's legislative organ is the [[Diet of Japan|National Diet]], a bicameral parliament. The Diet consists of a [[House of Representatives of Japan|House of Representatives]] with 480 seats, elected by popular vote every four years or when dissolved, and a [[House of Councillors]] of 242 seats, whose popularly elected members serve six-year terms. There is [[universal suffrage]] for adults over 20 years of age,<ref name="cia"/> with a [[secret ballot]] for all elected offices.<ref name="Constitution"/> The Diet is dominated by the social liberal [[Democratic Party of Japan]] and the conservative [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]] (LDP). The LDP has enjoyed near continuous electoral success since 1955, except for a brief 11 month period between 1993 and 1994, and from 2009 to 2012. It holds 294 seats in the lower house and 83 seats in the upper house.

The Prime Minister of Japan is the head of government and is appointed by the Emperor after being designated by the Diet from among its members. The Prime Minister is the head of the Cabinet, and he appoints and dismisses the [[Minister of State|Ministers of State]]. Following the LDP's landslide victory in the [[Japanese general election, 2012|2012 general election]], [[Shinz<U+014D> Abe]] replaced [[Yoshihiko Noda]] as the Prime Minister on 26 December 2012.<ref>{{cite news|last=Fackler|first=Martin|title=Ex-Premier Is Chosen To Govern Japan Again|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/27/world/asia/shinzo-abe-selected-as-japans-prime-minister.html?_r=1&|accessdate=12 March 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=27 December 2013|location=New York}}</ref>  Although the Prime Minister is formally appointed by the Emperor, the Constitution of Japan explicitly requires the Emperor to appoint whoever is designated by the Diet.<ref name="Constitution"/>

Historically influenced by [[Chinese law]], the [[law of Japan|Japanese legal system]] developed independently during the [[Edo]] period through texts such as ''[[Kujikata Osadamegaki]]''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Dean|first=Meryll|title=Japanese legal system: text, cases & materials|year=2002|publisher=Cavendish|isbn=978-1-85941-673-0|pages=55<U+2013>58|edition=2nd}}</ref> However, since the late 19th century the [[judicial system of Japan|judicial system]] has been largely based on the [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] of Europe, notably Germany. For example, in 1896, the Japanese government established a civil code based on a draft of the German [[B<U+00FC>rgerliches Gesetzbuch]]; with post<U+2013>World War II modifications, the code remains in effect.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kanamori|first=Shigenari|title=German influences on Japanese Pre-War Constitution and Civil Code|journal=European Journal of Law and Economics|date=1 January 1999|volume=7|issue=1|pages=93<U+2013>95|doi=10.1023/A:1008688209052}}</ref> Statutory law originates in Japan's legislature and has the [[rubber stamp (politics)|rubber stamp]] of the Emperor.

The islands of Japan are located in a [[Volcano|volcanic]] zone on the [[Pacific Ring of Fire]]. They are primarily the result of large oceanic movements occurring over hundreds of millions of years from the mid-Silurian to the Pleistocene as a result of the [[subduction]] of the [[Philippine Sea Plate]] beneath the continental [[Amurian Plate]] and [[Okinawa Plate]] to the south, and subduction of the [[Pacific Plate]] under the [[Okhotsk Plate]] to the north. Japan was originally attached to the eastern coast of the Eurasian continent.

The climate of Japan is predominantly [[temperate]], but varies greatly from north to south. Japan's geographical features divide it into six principal climatic zones: Hokkaid<U+014D>, Sea of Japan, [[Central Highland (Japan)|Central Highland]], [[Seto Inland Sea]], Pacific Ocean, and Ry<U+016B>ky<U+016B> Islands. The northernmost zone, Hokkaido, has a [[humid continental climate]] with long, cold winters and very warm to cool summers. [[precipitation (meteorology)|Precipitation]] is not heavy, but the islands usually develop deep snowbanks in the winter.<ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite book|last=Karan|first=Pradyumna Prasad|title=Japan in the 21st century|year=2005|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|isbn=0-8131-2342-9|pages=18<U+2013>21, 41|coauthor=Gilbreath, Dick}}</ref>

In the Sea of Japan zone on Honsh<U+016B>'s west coast, northwest winter winds bring heavy snowfall. In the summer, the region is cooler than the Pacific area, though it sometimes experiences extremely hot temperatures because of the [[foehn wind]]. The Central Highland has a typical inland humid continental climate, with large temperature differences between summer and winter, and between day and night; precipitation is light, though winters are usually snowy. The mountains of the [[Ch<U+016B>goku region|Ch<U+016B>goku]] and Shikoku regions shelter the Seto Inland Sea from seasonal winds, bringing mild weather year-round.<ref name=autogenerated2 />

The Pacific coast features a [[humid subtropical]] climate that experiences milder winters with occasional snowfall and hot, humid summers because of the southeast seasonal wind. The Ryukyu Islands have a [[subtropics|subtropical climate]], with warm winters and hot summers. Precipitation is very heavy, especially during the rainy season. The generally humid, temperate climate exhibits marked seasonal variation such as the blooming of the spring cherry blossoms, the calls of the summer cicada and fall foliage colors that are celebrated in [[Japanese art|art]] and [[Japanese literature|literature]].<ref name=autogenerated2 />

===Health===
{{Main|Health in Japan|Health care system in Japan}}
In Japan, health care is provided by national and local governments. Payment for personal medical services is offered through a universal health insurance system that provides relative equality of access, with fees set by a government committee. People without insurance through employers can participate in a national health insurance program administered by local governments. Since 1973, all elderly persons have been covered by government-sponsored insurance.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nyu.edu/projects/rodwin/lessons.html |first=Victor|last=Rodwin|title=Health Care in Japan |publisher=New York University |accessdate=10 March 2007}}</ref> Patients are free to select the physicians or facilities of their choice.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ipss.go.jp/s-info/e/Jasos/Health.html |title=Health Insurance: General Characteristics |publisher=National Institute of Population and Social Security Research |accessdate=28 March 2007}}</ref>

{{Main|Culture of Japan|Japanese popular culture|Japanese folklore}}
Japanese culture has evolved greatly from its origins. Contemporary culture combines influences from Asia, Europe and North America. Traditional Japanese arts include [[Japanese handicrafts|crafts]] such as [[Japanese pottery and porcelain|ceramics]], [[Kimono|textiles]], [[Japanese lacquerware|lacquerware]], [[Japanese sword|swords]] and [[Japanese traditional dolls|dolls]]; performances of [[bunraku]], [[kabuki]], [[noh]], [[Japanese traditional dance|dance]], and [[rakugo]]; and other practices, the [[Japanese tea ceremony|tea ceremony]], [[ikebana]], [[Japanese martial arts|martial arts]], [[Japanese calligraphy|calligraphy]], [[origami]], [[onsen]], [[Geisha]] and [[List of Japanese games|games]]. Japan has a developed system for the protection and promotion of both tangible and intangible [[Cultural Properties of Japan|Cultural Properties]] and [[National Treasures of Japan|National Treasures]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bunka.go.jp/english/index.html |title=Administration of Cultural Affairs in Japan |publisher=Agency for Cultural Affairs |accessdate=11 May 2011}}</ref> [[World Heritage Sites in Japan|Sixteen sites]] have been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List, twelve of which are of cultural significance.<ref name="unesco1"/>

===Art===
{{main|Japanese art|Japanese architecture|Japanese garden|Japanese aesthetics}}
The [[Ise Grand Shrine|Shrines of Ise]] have been celebrated as the prototype of Japanese architecture.<ref>{{cite book |title=Ise: Prototype of Japanese Architecture |author1=Tange, Kenzo |author2=Kawazoe, Noboru |year=1965 |publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology Press}}</ref> Largely of wood, [[Minka|traditional housing]] and many [[Japanese Buddhist architecture|temple buildings]] see the use of [[tatami]] mats and [[Sh<U+014D>ji|sliding doors]] that break down the distinction between rooms and indoor and outdoor space.<ref>{{cite book |title=What is Japanese Architecture?: A Survey of Traditional Japanese Architecture with a List of Sites and a Map |author1=Kazuo, Nishi |author2=Kazuo, Hozumi |year=1995 |publisher=Kodansha |isbn=978-4-7700-1992-9}}</ref> [[Japanese sculpture]], largely of wood, and [[Japanese painting]] are among the oldest of the Japanese arts, with early figurative paintings dating back to at least 300 BC.

The interaction between Japanese and European art has been significant: for example [[ukiyo-e]] prints, which began to be exported in the 19th century in the movement known as [[Japonism]], had a significant influence on the development of modern art in the West, most notably on [[post-Impressionism]].<ref name=autogenerated3 /> Famous ukiyo-e artists include [[Hokusai]] and [[Hiroshige]]. The fusion of traditional [[woodblock printing]] and Western art led to the creation of [[manga]], a comic book format that is now popular within and outside Japan.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dnp.co.jp/museum/nmp/nmp_i/articles/manga/manga1.html |title= A History of Manga |publisher=NMP International |accessdate=27 March 2007}}</ref> Manga-influenced animation for television and [[Cinema of Japan|film]] is called [[anime]].

===Music===
{{Main|Music of Japan}}
Japanese music is eclectic and diverse. Many [[Traditional Japanese musical instruments|instruments]], such as the [[koto (instrument)|koto]], were introduced in the 9th and 10th centuries. The accompanied [[recitative]] of the [[Noh]] drama dates from the 14th century and the popular [[Music of Japan#Folk music|folk music]], with the guitar-like [[shamisen]], from the sixteenth.<ref>{{cite book|last=Malm|first=William P.|title=Traditional Japanese music and musical instruments|year=2000|publisher=Kodansha International|isbn=978-4-7700-2395-7|pages=31<U+2013>45|edition=New}}</ref> Western classical music, introduced in the late 19th century, now forms an integral part of Japanese culture. The imperial court ensemble [[Gagaku]] has influenced the work of some [[20th-century classical music|modern]] Western composers.<ref>See for example, [[Olivier Messiaen]], ''Sept ha<U+00EF>ka<U+00EF>'' (1962),  (''Olivier Messiaen: a research and information guide'', Routledge, 2008, By Vincent Perez Benitez, page 67) and (''Messiaen the Theologian'', Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2010, page 243-65, By Andrew Shenton)</ref>

Notable classical composers from Japan include [[Toru Takemitsu]] and [[Rentar<U+014D> Taki]]. Popular music in post-war Japan has been heavily influenced by American and European trends, which has led to the evolution of [[J-pop]], or Japanese popular music.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2005/aug/21/popandrock3 |title= J-Pop History |work=The Observer | accessdate=1 April 2007 | first=Chris | last=Campion | date=22 August 2005 | location=London}}</ref> [[Karaoke]] is the most widely practiced cultural activity in Japan. A 1993 survey by the [[Agency for Cultural Affairs|Cultural Affairs Agency]] found that more Japanese had sung karaoke that year than had participated in traditional pursuits such as flower arranging (ikebana) or tea ceremonies.<ref>{{cite book|title=The worlds of Japanese popular culture: gender, shifting boundaries and global cultures|year=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-63729-9|page=76|edition=Repr.|editor=Martinez, D.P.}}</ref>

During the Edo period, the [[ch<U+014D>nin]] ("townspeople") overtook the samurai aristocracy as producers and consumers of literature. The popularity of the works of [[Saikaku]], for example, reveals this change in readership and authorship, while [[Matsuo Bash<U+014D>|Bash<U+014D>]] revivified the poetic tradition of the [[Kokinsh<U+016B>]] with his [[haikai]] ([[haiku]]) and wrote the poetic travelogue ''[[Oku no Hosomichi]]''.<ref>{{cite book |title=World Within Walls: Japanese Literature of the Pre-Modern Era, 1600<U+2013>1867 |author=Keene, Donald |publisher=Columbia University Press |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-231-11467-7}}</ref> The Meiji era saw the decline of traditional literary forms as Japanese literature integrated Western influences.
