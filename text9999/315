The '''Committee of Secretaries-General''' ({{lang-fr|Comit<U+00E9> des S<U+00E9>cretaires-g<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>raux}}, {{lang-nl|Comit<U+00E9> van de secretarissen-generaal}}) was a [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[Technocracy|technocratic]] administrative panel created during [[World War II]]. The Committee comprised the head civil servants of most government ministries (who each held the title [[Secretary-General]]) and formed an part of the German occupation administration of Belgium between 1940 and 1944, being an integral role in the Belgian policy of "lesser evil" collaboration. From August 1940, the Germans began introducing new members, and by 1941 its composition was almost completely different. Among those promoted were pro-Germans like [[Victor Leemans]] and [[G<U+00E9>rard Roms<U+00E9>e]], who had been involved in Belgian Fascist movements before the war. They helped to facilitate the more radical administrative reforms demanded by the Germans, although the Committee refused to involve itself in the [[The Holocaust in Belgium|deportation of Belgian Jews]]. As the visible face of the German administration, the Committee became more and more unpopular as the war progressed. Following the [[Allies (World War II)|Allied]] liberation of Belgium in 1944, several members of the Committee were prosecuted for collaboration but several members, including Leemans, went on to political careers in post-war Belgium.

==Background==
The Committee was installed by the Belgian government of [[Hubert Pierlot]] on 16 May 1940 as an administrative committee to oversee the basic functioning of the Belgian state in the absence of the official government.<ref name=NHdB19-20>{{cite book|last1=Van den Wijngaert|first1=Mark|last2=Dujardin|first2=Vincent|title=La Belgique sans Roi, 1940<U+2013>1950|work=Nouvelle Historie de Belgique, 1905<U+2013>1950 (vol.2)|year=2006|publisher=<U+00C9>d. Complexe|location=Brussels|isbn=2-8048-0078-4|pages=19<U+2013>20}}</ref> While the ministers departed for [[Bordeaux]] in [[French Third Republic|France]], the Secretaries-General (chief civil servants responsible for each department) of each ministry were ordered to remain in the country, along with all other civil servants, to allow the state to continue functioning.<ref name=Gotovich408/>

The Committee formed part of the policy of officially sanctioned "lesser evil" collaboration among the civil service and government bureaus left behind.{{#tag:ref|The basis of the policy of lesser-evil ("''Moindre-mal''") was that continued control over state functions and the normal operation of the government was the best way to preserve Belgian interests. The same policy formed the basis of the [[Galopin doctrine]], which allowed limited collaboration in order to avoid potential German reprisals or post-war industrial decline.<ref name=NHdB19-20/>|group="note"}}

==Purpose and role==
During the [[Rape of Belgium|German occupation of Belgium in World War I]], many Belgian workers had refused to work for the German administration as a form of [[Non-violent resistance|passive resistance]]. This had led to large-scale reprisals against civilians as the occupiers had attempted to enforce their policies by armed force.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kossmann|first=E.H.|title=The Low Countries: 1780<U+2013>1940|year=1978|pages=525<U+2013>9|isbn=0198221088|location=Oxford|publisher=Oxford University Press}}</ref>

The Committee hoped to avoid the Germans becoming involved in the day-to-day administration of the territory as they had during World War I, while also allowing Belgium to maintain a degree of national autonomy and independence.<ref name=NHdB20-26>{{cite book|last1=Van den Wijngaert|first1=Mark|last2=Dujardin|first2=Vincent|title=La Belgique sans Roi, 1940<U+2013>1950|work=Nouvelle Historie de Belgique, 1905<U+2013>1950 (vol.2)|year=2006|publisher=<U+00C9>d. Complexe|location=Brussels|isbn=2-8048-0078-4|pages=20<U+2013>6}}</ref> The Committee also hoped to be able to prevent the implementation of more radical German policies, like forced labour and deportation.<ref name=NHdB20-26/> The legal basis of the Committee was a law of 7 September 1939, through which in times of crisis, a Secretary-General could exert full control over his own department, but without having the full status of being a minister.<ref name=NHdB20-26/>

===Place within the German administration===
After the Belgian surrender on 28 May 1940, the Germans formed a ''[[Military Administration in Belgium and Northern France|Milit<U+00E4>rverwaltung]]'' (Military Administration) in the country; commanded by the German aristocrat and career soldier, General [[Alexander von Falkenhausen]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Geller|first=Jay Howard|title=The Role of Military Administration in German-occupied Belgium, 1940<U+2013>1944|journal=[[Journal of Military History]]|year=1999|month=January|volume=63|issue=1|page=99|issn=0899-3718}}</ref> A section of the administration called the ''Milit<U+00E4>rverwaltungsstab'' (Military Administrative [[Staff (military)|Staff]]), commanded by ''SS-Gruppenf<U+00FC>hrer'' [[Eggert Reeder]], was reponsable for the day-to-day civil administration of the territory.<ref name=NHdB19-20/> The ''Milit<U+00E4>rverwaltungsstab'' would present its demands to the Secretaries-General, even though the Committee was separate, in order to have them carried out.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lemkin|first=Rapha<U+00EB>l|title=Axis rule in occupied Europe: Laws of Occupation; Analysis of Government; Proposals for Redress|publisher=Lawbook Exchange|location=New Jersey|year=2005|page=12|isbn=1584775769}}</ref>

==Composition==
The original committee of five was installed after the departure of the government in May 1940. In August 1940, they were joined by a further five new Secretaries-General representing other ministries.<ref name=Gotovich408/> In early 1941, there was a reshuffle, replacing many of the original members.<ref name=Gotovich409/> The 1941 reshuffle introduced more pro-Germans into the committee, such as G<U+00E9>rard Roms<U+00E9>e who was a noted member of the pro-Nazi {{lang|nl|''[[Flemish National Union|Vlaams Nationaal Verbond]]''}} (VNV) party.<ref name=Gotovich408/>

==Policies==
Throughout 1940 the Secretaries-General continued to follow their "policy of lesser-evils", influenced by the [[Galopin doctrine]], in the hope that the occupiers would respect the protocol established at the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|Hague Conventions of 1907]].<ref name=Gotovich409/> 

From the summer of 1940, the Committee became increasingly divided between the members keen for closer collaboration with the Germans, led by [[Victor Leemans]], and those who wished to remain strictly within the proscribed Belgian legal framework, led by Ernst de Bunswyck.<ref name=Gotovich409/> In October 1940, the Germans were able to pass fundamental changes to the system of regional [[Burgomaster]]s in the country though the Committee without resistance.<ref name=NHdB20-26/> The Committee had announced in October 1940 that it would refuse to enforce anti-Jewish legislation, but did not resist their implementation by the military government.<ref name=Gotovich412>{{cite book|editor1-last=Gotovitch| editor1-first=Jos<U+00E9>| editor2-last=Aron|editor2-first=Paul|title=Dictionnaire de la Seconde Guerre Mondiale en Belgique|year=2008|publisher=Andr<U+00E9> Versaille <U+00E9>d.|location=Brussels|isbn=978-2-87495-001-8|page=412}}</ref> The Committee's ambivalent stance meant that Belgian policemen and civil servants were not instructed to refuse to participate in rounding-up of Jews as part of the [[Final Solution]] from 1942.<ref name=Gotovich412/> Tensions grew between the Germans and the committee in December 1940, and in early 1941 the Germans reshuffled the committee; appointing more pro-Nazi members.<ref name=Gotovich409/> From March 1941, it became clear that the Committee would no longer be able to resist German demands, even those clearly violating the Hague Convention.<ref name=Gotovich410/>

From 1942, collaborationist members of the Committee were able to further their policies. In Internal Affairs, Roms<U+00E9>e began encouraging an overtly collaborationist policy in his department, encouraging Burgomaster positions to be given to pro-Nazi members of the right-wing {{lang|fr|''[[Rexism|Rex]]''}} and VNV parties in [[Wallonia]] and [[Flanders]] respectively.<ref name=Gotovich410/> Many existing Burgomasters were dismissed on a variety of pretexts in order to clear the path for the new candidates.<ref name=Wullus-Rudiger48-9/> He also appointed the pro-German Emiel Van Coppenolle (also a friend of Roms<U+00E9>e) to the head of the Belgian police service.<ref name=Wullus-Rudiger48-9/><ref name=Gotovich410/> These measures gave the pro-German members of the Committee direct control over the country's local government, its police force and security service.<ref name=Wullus-Rudiger48-9/> At the same time, Leemans encouraged the merger of various "Central offices" to co-ordinate industries (along lines of the pre-war ''[[Gleichschaltung]]'' in Germany) and greater economic integration into the {{lang|de|''Gro<U+00DF>raumwirtschaft''}} (Greater Economy) and [[Nazi Germany]].<ref name=Gotovich410/> Other members of the Committee were also responsible for creating other groupings, like the {{lang|fr|''Office National de Travail''}} (ONT; National Office for Work) which would be used for coordinating the deportation of Belgian workers to factories in Germany from October 1942.<ref name=Gotovich412/>

In October 1942, the Germans began to implement compulsory deportation of Belgian workers to work in German factories. The introduction of the policy, which had been imposed in World War I and which the Committee had hoped to avoid at all costs, marked the last blow to the Committee's influence.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Strikwerda|first=Carl|title=The German Occupation of Belgium 1940-1944 by Werner Warmbrunn (review)|journal=[[Central European History]]|volume=27|number=4|year=1994|location=Cambridge|page=550|issn=0008-9389}}</ref>

Legislation decreed the Secretaries-General are known as "''Arr<U+00EA>tes''" (Rulings), whereas those decreed by the Military Administration directly are entitled "''Ordonnances''" (Orders).<ref name=Wullus-Rudiger48-9>{{cite book|last=Wullus-Rudiger|first=J.A.|title=La Belgique et la Crise Europ<U+00E9>ene, 1914<U+2013>1945|volume=II: 1940<U+2013>1945|year=1945|publisher=<U+00C9>d. Berger-Levrault|pages=48<U+2013>9|location=|oclc=004156520}}</ref>

==Criticism==
Despite its aims, the Committee was in large part responsible for the ease with which the Germans could implement their policies in Belgium and was unable to moderate many German policies, such as [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|deportation of workers]] to Germany (though delayed to October 1942) or the [[The Holocaust in Belgium|persecution of Jews]].<ref name=Gotovich412-3/> In particular, encouraging the Germans to delegate tasks to the Committee meant that the Germans were effectively using the established national civil service, which allowed much more efficient implementation than could have been achieved by force.<ref name=NHdB20-26/> Since Belgium was also dependent on Germany for the imports of food it needed, the Committee was always at a disadvantage during negotiations.<ref name=NHdB20-26/>

The Committee was heavily criticised by the [[Belgian government in exile]] in London for aiding the Germans.<ref name=Gotovich410>{{cite book|editor1-last=Gotovitch| editor1-first=Jos<U+00E9>| editor2-last=Aron|editor2-first=Paul|title=Dictionnaire de la Seconde Guerre Mondiale en Belgique|year=2008|publisher=Andr<U+00E9> Versaille <U+00E9>d.|location=Brussels|isbn=978-2-87495-001-8|page=410}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Grosbois|first=Thierry|title=Pierlot, 1930<U+2013>1950|year=1998|location=Brussels|publisher=Racine|isbn=2-87386-485-0|pages=271<U+2013>2}}</ref> The Secretaries-General were also unpopular within Belgium itself. In 1942, the journalist [[Paul Struye]] described them as "the object of growing and almost unanimous unpopularity."<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jacquemyns|first1=Guillaume|last2=Struye|first2=Paul|authorlink2=Paul Struye|title=La Belgique sous l'Occupation Allemande: 1940<U+2013>1944|year=2002|publisher=<U+00C9>d. Complexe|location=Brussels|isbn=2-87027-940-X|page=141|edition=Rev.}}</ref> As the face of the German occupation authority, they also became unpopular with the public, which blamed them for the German demands they were implementing.<ref name=Gotovich410/>

After the war, several of the Secretaries-General were tried for collaboration with the occupants. Most were acquitted after basic examination. Roms<U+00E9>e (Secretary-General for Internal Affairs) was sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment and Schuind (responable for Justice) was sentenced to five years'.<ref name=Gotovich412-3>{{cite book|editor1-last=Gotovitch| editor1-first=Jos<U+00E9>| editor2-last=Aron|editor2-first=Paul|title=Dictionnaire de la Seconde Guerre Mondiale en Belgique|year=2008|publisher=Andr<U+00E9> Versaille <U+00E9>d.|location=Brussels|isbn=978-2-87495-001-8|pages=412<U+2013>3}}</ref> Many of the former Secretaries-General went on to careers in politics after the war. Both De Winter and Leemans served as a [[Senate (Belgium)|senators]] for the centre-right [[Christian Social Party (Belgium, defunct)|Christian Social Party]] (PSC-CVP) and Leemans ended his career as President of the [[European Parliament]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Beke|first=Wouter|title=De Ziel van eel Zuil: de Christelijke Volkspartij 1945<U+2013>1968|publisher=Catholic University of Leuven|year=2005|location=Leuven|page=363|isbn=9058674983}}</ref>
