'''Maynard James Keenan''' (born '''James Herbert Keenan''' on [[April 17]], [[1964]]) is an [[United States|American]] [[rock music|rock]] [[singer]], [[songwriter]], [[musician]], and [[Record producer|producer]]. Although originally from [[Ohio]], Keenan spent his high school and college years in [[Michigan]]. After serving in the [[United States Army|Army]] in the early 1980s, he attended [[Kendall College of Art and Design]] in [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]]. He relocated to [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], [[California]] in 1988 to pursue a career in interior design and set construction, and formed the band [[Tool (band)|Tool]] with [[Adam Jones]] shortly thereafter.

Keenan is best known as the lead singer of the [[Music recording sales certification|multi-platinum]] rock bands Tool and [[A Perfect Circle]] with whom he has released four and three [[studio album]]s, respectively. In 2003, he created [[Puscifer]] as a side project, financing and releasing its first studio album in October 2007. In addition to his music career, he has performed [[Improvisation|improvisational]] [[stand-up comedy]] inspired by close friend [[Bill Hicks]] and ventured into acting. His family has been involved in [[winemaking]]; he currently owns Merkin Vineyards and Caduceus Cellars in [[Arizona]], where he resides.  Among other business ventures, he is a partner in the Los Angeles restaurant Cobras & Matadors. Since rising to fame, Keenan has been a noted recluse, although he does emerge to support charitable causes.

==Early life==
[[Image:Mjk-usma.jpg|thumb|left|Keenan's photo in a [[United States Military Academy Preparatory School]] yearbook (class of 1984)]]
James Keenan was born in [[Ravenna, Ohio]] on [[April 17]] [[1964]], the only child of Judith Marie and Michael Loren Keenan. When his parents divorced in 1968, his father, a high school teacher, moved to [[Michigan]] and Keenan would only see him about once a year for the next 12 years. His mother remarried, bringing Keenan into an "intolerant and unworldly household", where his intelligence and creative expression would be stifled.<ref name=McAlley/> When Keenan was 11, his mother suffered a paralyzing [[cerebral aneurysm]], which would later serve as the inspiration for many of his creative works. Two years later, she persuaded Keenan to live with his father in Michigan.<ref name=McAlley>McAlley, John. (December 2007).

Inspired by [[Bill Murray]]'s performance in the 1981 comedy film ''[[Stripes (film)|Stripes]]'', Keenan joined the [[United States Army]], with the intention of having the [[Servicemen's Readjustment Act (USA)|G.I.

==Career==
===Tool===
After moving to Los Angeles, Keenan met [[Adam Jones]], who had heard him singing on a [[Demo (music)|demo]] in college, and Jones suggested that they form a band. Although reluctant at first,<ref name="AV"/> Keenan agreed and, in 1990, [[Tool (band)|Tool]] was formed. Fronted by Keenan, the eventual lineup included [[guitarist]] Jones, his neighbor, [[drummer]] [[Danny Carey]], and [[bassist]] [[Paul D'Amour]], who would later be replaced by [[Justin Chancellor]].<ref name="circusmagazine">{{cite journal

Tool signed to [[Zoo Entertainment]] in November 1991 and released the ''[[Opiate (EP)|Opiate]]'' EP the following year. To support this release, the band toured with [[Fishbone]] and [[Rage Against the Machine]]. During a 1993 show at the [[Church of Scientology]]<U+2019>s [[Celebrity Centre]] in Los Angeles, Keenan, (who would later write the lyrics "Fuck [[L. Ron Hubbard]] and fuck all his clones"), baa-ed like a sheep for a good portion of the show. "Before our set this guy tries to intimidate me by showing me a gun in his jacket," Keenan recalled. "I explained to him that if he pissed me off I<U+2019>d start a riot."<ref name=Blender/> Shortly thereafter, Tool released their 1993 debut album, ''[[Undertow (Tool album)|Undertow]]'', in the United States, where it was certified gold after just eight months, and platinum less than a year later.<ref name=GPC>([[2002-06-07]]).

In October 1996, the band released their second studio album, ''[[<U+00C6>nima]]'', which was certified gold in 10&nbsp;weeks and achieved double platinum in 10&nbsp;months.<ref name=GPC/> ''The Metal Observer'' reviewed the album stating, "Knowing what is around the corner is rarely guessed correctly and the band focus brutality with melody in equal measure.

During the hiatus, the band members were outspokenly critical of [[filesharing]] networks, due to the negative financial impact on artists dependent on success in record sales. During an interview with ''NY Rock'' in 2000, Keenan stated, "I think there are a lot of other industries out there that might deserve being destroyed. The ones who get hurt by [[MP3]]s are not so much companies or the business, but the artists, people who are trying to write songs."<ref name=nyrock>{{cite web | url=http://www.nyrock.com/interviews/2000/apc_int.asp | title=Interview with Maynard James Keenan of A Perfect Circle | work=NY Rock | accessdate=2006-04-28 | month = September | year=2000 | author=Gabriella}}</ref>

During Tool's post-''<U+00C6>nima'' hiatus to deal with their legal issues, Keenan began working with [[Billy Howerdel]], Tool's [[Guitar technician|guitar tech]] through the ''<U+00C6>nima'' tour, on a different project. The [[supergroup]] they formed, [[A Perfect Circle]], began performing in 1999 and released its first album ''[[Mer de Noms]]'' in 2000. They released a successful follow-up in 2003 titled ''[[Thirteenth Step]]'', a reference to [[twelve-step program]]s (many of the songs were written from the perspective of recovery).<ref name=legend/> Both albums were eventually certified platinum. They followed up in 2004 with the release of ''[[Emotive (album)|eMOTIVe]]'', an album composed of covers except the singles "[[Counting Bodies Like Sheep to the Rhythm of the War Drums]]"<U+2014>a song inspired by "Pet" that was originally released on ''Thirteenth Step''<U+2014>and "Passive". Keenan later characterized the record as a political album with which he "tested the waters" and was subsequently "crucified" for it because of the content.<ref name=AV/> It was certified gold the month after its release. That same year they released the DVD and CD set entitled ''[[aMotion]]'', which was certified platinum within a month of its release.

Although highly successful, the future of A Perfect Circle remains uncertain. It is currently on hiatus, partly due to Keenan's commitments to Tool, and Howerdel reporting in a May 2006 interview with MTV that the supergroup's work was concluded for the time being.<ref>Harris, Chris ([[2006-05-16]]).

Retrieved on [[2008-01-27]].</ref> After more than two years since the bands last release, Keenan was asked about the status of A Perfect Circle during an interview with ''[[Revolver (magazine)|Revolver]]''. He stated:

{{quote|The real problem with running Tool and A Perfect Circle at the same time was they both operate the same way. They're both live touring bands with a label, still working under the old contract mentality. So I thought it was time to let A Perfect Circle go for now and let Billy explore himself. It's tough for a guy who went from being a guitar tech [for Tool] to being in a band with a pretentious, famous singer and having to live in that shadow. It was important for Billy to go and do his own thing and really explore his own sound and let people hear what he has to say and how he would do it on his own, and then we'll get back and do some A Perfect Circle stuff.|Maynard James Keenan|''[[Revolver (magazine)|Revolver]], December 2007''<ref name="revolver">Wiederhorn, Jon (December 2007).

==Comedy==

Keenan became friends with comedian [[Bill Hicks]] in the early 1990s. Keenan did stand-up comedy on [[Improvisational comedy|improv]] nights in comedy clubs in Los Angeles during that time.<ref name=Comedy>Kharakh, Bed ([[2007-11-06]]). "[http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2007/11/06/starpulse_qaamp_a_maynard_james_keenan_n Bill Starpulse Q&A: Maynard James Keenan: N for New Album]". Starpulse.com. Retrieved on [[2008-04-14]].</ref> The two became acquainted and Hicks later [[opening act|opened]] some Tool concerts. Best known is a [[Comedy routine|routine]] Hicks did while on tour with Tool during the [[Lollapalooza]] tour in 1993, when he asked the audience to look for a [[contact lens]] he had lost. Keenan enjoyed this joke so much that he repeated it on a number of occasions.

Keenan is featured in several segments of ''[[Mr. Show]]'',<ref>{{cite news

Later in the sketch he is featured wearing a wig as the lead singer of the then-fictitious band "[[Puscifer]]". When asked about the arrest of Dobbs, Keenan replies "Guilty? Yeah. I'm sure he's guilty but... he ''knows'' it. I mean, you're guilty, and you don't know it. So... who's really in jail?" He also appears in episode 2.6, "The Velveteen Touch of a Dandy Fop", as one of the viewers of ''Coupon: The Movie'', saying "Now is not the time", waving the cameras off and slapping the microphone out of his face in disgust after walking out of the theater. Later, Keenan would sing on a track for the ''Mr. Show'' incarnation ''[[Run Ronnie Run]]'',<ref>{{cite news

When asked in an interview which role was more difficult, Keenan responded, "Oh, Manson. He<U+2019>s a real person. People know what he looks like, how he talked. With Satan there<U+2019>s so much gray area."<ref name=Blender/>

In the mid-90s, responding to requests for Tool to perform in benefit shows, Keenan created "Free [[Frances Bean]]" tee-shirts to represent his own platform. Frances' mother [[Courtney Love]] had previously referred to Keenan as a "media whore" to which he responded, "Isn't that great? I have the distinction of being called a media whore by Courtney Love."<ref name=legend/> He said that after watching "the tornado that is her mother", he thought "Oh my God, how is Frances Bean gonna survive this insanity?"<ref name=legend/> Although it was started as a simple joke, the tee-shirts were soon in high demand and Keenan was giving them away.<ref name=legend/>
