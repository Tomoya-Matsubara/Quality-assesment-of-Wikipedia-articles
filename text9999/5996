'''Microsoft Points''' (denoted as [[Image:Microsoftpoint.gif]]) are the currency of the [[Xbox Live Marketplace]], [[Windows Live Gallery]] and [[Zune]] online stores. The points allow users to purchase content without a credit card, and reduce the number of small [[credit card]] [[interchange fee|transaction fees]] which [[Microsoft]] would otherwise pay.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3164822 | last=Klepek | first=Patrick | title=XBL WTF: Why Can't I Pay Exact Change on XBL? | work=1UP.com | date=2007-12-07}}</ref> Many downloads on the Xbox Live Marketplace are free, but other downloads, such as full versions of arcade games and extras for some games, cost Microsoft Points. 

==Point cost per region==
[[Image:Microsoft points card 2100.jpg|thumb|right|Prepaid Microsoft Points Card.]]
Microsoft Points are sold in each country in the local currency. However, because the official price per point is defined differently for each country (in terms of their local currency), some regions pay more (in terms of cost relative to the US dollar) for the same quantity of points than others due to currency fluctuations.

Microsoft Points are purchased either online via credit card or in the form of ''Microsoft Points Cards'' (also known as "tokens") from retail locations. Points can be bought in a number of different allotments ranging from 400 up to 5000 Microsoft Points. In the [[United States]], 80 points are equal to [[United States dollar|US$]]1.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://thewrongadvices.com/2007/03/05/xbox-live-points-converter/ | title=XBOX Live Points Converter | publisher=The Wrong Advices | date=2007-03-05}}</ref>As a result, an 800 point [[Xbox Live Arcade|arcade game]] would retail for US$10 in real-world currency.

===Differences between regions===
The price of Microsoft Points varies considerably between regions. When launched, Microsoft Points were priced approximately the same in each country. However, because Microsoft does not generally change the pricing to coincide with the current [[exchange rate]]s, the cost per point in other countries relative to the United States is constantly fluctuating. Using exchange rates from [[May 22]] [[2008]]:

The available allotments also vary by region. For example, the minimum purchasable amount in the UK is 500 points, compared to 400 points in the US. Token amounts vary by country as well, in an effort to find a "natural" price point. For example, points cards are officially priced in the UK at 2100 points for <U+00A3>17.99 and in the US at 1600 points for $19.99. In the UK, 1600 points would be <U+00A3>13.71 and in the US 2100 points would be $26.25, neither of which is a round number.

===Taxes===
Depending on the registered country or address of an account, the online purchase of Microsoft Points may be taxed. The following list includes regions which must pay [[value added tax]] or luxury tax in accordance with local government regulations:
* [[European Union]]
* [[Canada]]


In the United States, states continue to push for [[sales tax]] or [[use tax]] collection on online purchases.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://news.zdnet.com/2100-3513_22-5187751.html | last=Becker | first=David | title=States push for piece of online sales | work=CNET News | date=2004-04-09}}</ref> As a result, Microsoft is now automatically assessing these taxes on online Microsoft Point purchases in applicable locations, e.g. New York.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.tax.state.ny.us/pdf/publications/sales/pub774_206.pdf | title=Purchaser's Obligations to Pay Sales and Use Taxes Directly to the Tax Department: Questions and Answers | publisher=New York State Department of Taxation and Finance | accessdate=2007-02-22}}</ref>

==Prepaid cards==
Prepaid cards can be purchased at retail stores such as [[Target Corporation|Target]], [[Circuit City]], [[Best Buy]], [[Wal-Mart]], [[EBGames]], [[Radioshack]] and [[GameStop]] allowing individuals who lack or do not want to use a credit card to directly purchase Microsoft Points using cash or check. Each card is worth a certain pre-determined amount of Microsoft Points which can be added to any Xbox Live account or Zune Marketplace account using a code located on the card. Cards come in various denominations of Points, depending on the country. Once used, cards have no further value and cannot be "recharged" or partially redeemed. Cards purchased in one region cannot be associated with Xbox Live accounts from other regions. This is often a surprise to Canadian and American residents purchasing cards across the border -- terms printed on prepaid cards do not explain this and the Terms of Use available online warn only that Microsoft "may further restrict your Points redemption offers based on your country of residence."<ref name="prepaidcards1">
{{cite web|url=http://www.xbox.com/en-US/live/legal/legal-tou.htm |publisher=Microsoft |title=XBox Live Terms of Use |accessdate=2007-11-20}}</ref>

Cards can also be purchased from [[7-11]] stores, as well as a number of gas stations and other convenience stores.

===Card pricing===
Cards are usually sold at their full retail price (plus applicable sales tax), but can be sold at a discount in some cases, providing a better-than-normal exchange rate.

In the [[United Kingdom]], most video game retailers sell pre-paid cards with a value of 2,100 Microsoft Points. These have a retail price of <U+00A3>17.50, though actual price varies depending on individual store. Purchasing one of these gives a cost of <U+00A3>0.00833 per point, which is slightly cheaper than purchasing online (<U+00A3>0.0085 per point).

In the [[United States]], most video game retailers also sell pre-paid cards with a value of 1,600 Microsoft Points. These have a retail price of $20.00. Purchasing one of these gives a cost of ($0.0125 per point), which is the same as purchasing online ($0.0125 per point).  Additionally, cards with a value of 4,000 points are also available, with a retail price of $50.00 (also $0.0125 per point).

[[Canada|Canadian]] retail stores sell pre-paid cards with a value of 1,400 Microsoft Points for approximately $20 CAD. This works out to $0.014 per point, which is slightly cheaper than buying online ($0.015 per point). Additionally, cards worth 2,800 Microsoft Points recently became available for approximately $40 CAD (which is the same price per point).

In [[Mexico]], most game stores sell pre-paid cards with a value of 1,500 Microsoft Points, with a retail price of $199 MXN. This equates to about $0.13300 MXN per point ($0.01204 USD per point).

In [[New Zealand]], most game stores sell pre-paid cards with a value of 1,500 Microsoft Points, for around $25 NZD. This equates to about $0.0167 NZD per point.

Similarly, [[Australia]]n game and department stores also sell pre-paid cards with a value of 1,500 Microsoft Points at an [[Suggested retail price|RRP]] of $25.00 AUD. This equates to about $0.0167 AUD per point, which is slightly more expensive than purchasing online ($0.0165 per point).

In [[Japan]], retail stores and some [[convenience store]]s sell pre-paid cards with a value of 700 Microsoft Points for <U+00A5>1,050, 1,400 Microsoft Points for <U+00A5>2,100 and 3,500 Microsoft Points for <U+00A5>5,250. These works out to <U+00A5>1.5 per point, which is slightly more expensive than buying online (<U+00A5>1.48 per point).

==Xbox Live Marketplace==
Microsoft Points are the official currency of the [[Xbox Live Marketplace]], including [[Xbox Live Arcade]]. They can be used at the Xbox Live Marketplace to purchase games, themes, Gamertag pictures, original Xbox titles, game expansion material (e.g. vehicles, maps, songs, etc.), and other content. Since [[November 22]] [[2006]], users in some regions have also been able to purchase videos and television episodes from the Marketplace, however many regions - such as Australia - are still paying comparatively more (on the exchange rate) for a service that does not provide any of this content. Microsoft Points and purchases made with them are non-refundable.

==Zune Marketplace==
Microsoft Points can be used at the [[Zune#Software and Zune Marketplace|Zune Marketplace]] just as at the Xbox Live Marketplace, and are transferable between the two systems. Music tracks can be purchased with Microsoft Points at the Zune Marketplace for 79 Points each ($0.99 USD) or 99 Points each ($1.24 USD). Whole albums can often be purchased for 880 points ($11.00 USD), although the pricing varies depending on the selected album.

==Criticisms==
The Microsoft Points system has been criticized for being deceptive in terms of actual real-world cost. In his review of the [[Zune]], news editor for ''Windows IT Pro Magazine'' [[Paul Thurott]] mentions<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.winsupersite.com/reviews/zune.asp | last=Thurrott | first=Paul | title=Microsoft Zune Review | publisher=Paul Thurrott's SuperSite for Windows | date=2007-07-04}}</ref>: 

Also, ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' technology reporter [[Walt Mossberg]] notes<ref>{{cite web | url=http://ptech.allthingsd.com/20061109/zune-challenges-ipod/ | last=Mossberg | first=Walt | title=Microsoft's Zune Challenges iPod | publisher=All Things Digital | date=2006-11-09}}</ref>:
<blockquote>
To buy even a single 99-cent song from the Zune store, you have to purchase blocks of <U+201C>points<U+201D> from Microsoft, in increments of at least $5. You can<U+2019>t just click and have the 99 cents deducted from a credit card, as you can with iTunes. [..] So, even if you are buying only one song, you have to allow Microsoft, one of the world<U+2019>s richest companies, to hold on to at least $4.01 of your money until you buy another.
