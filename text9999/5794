"'''Soprano Home Movies'''" is the seventy-eighth episode of the [[HBO]] [[television series]] ''[[The Sopranos]]''. It served as the [[season premiere|midseason premiere]] to the second half of the show's sixth season (the broadcast of which was split into two parts) and is the thirteenth episode of the season overall. It was written by supervising producers [[Diane Frolov]] and [[Andrew Schneider]], series creator/executive producer [[David Chase]], and executive producer [[Matthew Weiner]]. It was directed by longtime series director [[Tim Van Patten]]. It originally aired in the [[United States]] on [[April 8]] [[2007]], attracting 7.7&nbsp;million viewers. Critical reception of the midseason premiere was mostly favorable; critics praised the episode for its calm, contemplative storytelling. "Soprano Home Movies" garnered a number of award nominations and was the episode submitted to [[Emmy Award]] voters to represent the season, leading to a win for "[[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series|Outstanding Drama Series]]".

Set eight months after the preceding episode,<ref>"[[Kaisha]]" ends with a Christmas Eve dinner at the Soprano residence, making the date [[2006-12-24]]. In "Soprano Home Movies", they celebrate Tony's forty-seventh birthday. In "[[Another Toothpick]]" Tony's birth date is given as [[1960-08-24]]. This means almost exactly eight months elapsed between the episodes.</ref> "Soprano Home Movies" details a weekend that series [[protagonist]] [[Tony Soprano]] and his wife [[Carmela Soprano|Carmela]] ([[James Gandolfini]] and [[Edie Falco]]) spend at his sister and brother-in-law's lakefront vacation home in upstate [[New York]]. As they celebrate Tony's birthday, a casual argument leads to insults and culminates in a fistfight between Tony and his brother-in-law, [[Bobby Bacala|Bobby]] ([[Steve Schirripa]]). After losing the fight, Tony contemplates how to get back at Bobby.

==Plot==
In a flashback to 2004, a neighborhood teenage boy witnesses [[Johnny Sack]]'s ([[Vincent Curatola]]) arrest and Tony Soprano's dropping of his gun in the snow as he flees the scene. The same teenage boy later picks up and fires the gun.

Three years later, [[Essex County, New Jersey|Essex County]] authorities arrest Tony on a gun charge. Tony spends a short period of time in custody before appearing in court with his attorney, [[List of characters from The Sopranos in the DiMeo Crime Family#Neil Mink|Neil Mink]] ([[David Margulies]]), and is released on bail. In [[Brooklyn, New York|Brooklyn]], a party is held for [[Phil Leotardo]] ([[Frank Vincent]]), who has recently returned from the hospital.

Tony returns home to a warm welcome. Later, he and Carmela travel to [[Janice Soprano|Janice]] ([[Aida Turturro]]) and Bobby's upstate New York lakefront vacation home to celebrate Tony's forty-seventh birthday, where Tony fires Bobby's customized [[AR-10]] [[assault rifle]] in the nearby woods. Bobby gives Tony the [[firearm]] as a birthday present. The two later relax by fishing on the lake in Bobby's boat. Tony raises the fact that Bobby has never "popped his cherry" in regard to murdering someone and juxtaposes this with the kill record of [[List of characters from The Sopranos in the Soprano crime family#Robert "Bobby" Baccalieri, Sr.|Bobby's father]]. Bobby replies that he has "come close," but that his father never wanted it for him. In [[New Jersey]], [[A.J. Soprano|A.J.]] ([[Robert Iler]]) uses his parents' bedroom to entertain his new girlfriend and has friends over for a party while his parents are away.

Tony, Carmela, Bobby, and Janice celebrate Tony's birthday with [[karaoke]], drinking, and [[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]]. An argument starts after a discussion of [[Monopoly (game)#House rules|Monopoly house rules]]. Over Tony's objections, Janice relates a childhood story of their [[List of characters from The Sopranos - Friends and Family#John Francis "Johnny Boy" Soprano|father]] and [[Livia Soprano|mother]]; tensions reach a crescendo with Tony's remarks about Janice's looks and past promiscuous behavior. Bobby hits Tony in the face and the two have a fight, ending with Tony bloodied and bruised on the floor. Janice scolds Bobby for hitting Tony, and Bobby runs outside, where he drives off drunk in his SUV and reverses into a tree. He returns inside and apologizes to Tony and the two couples go to their beds. Tony wakes up in the middle of the night and tells Bobby and Janice that Bobby beat him in a fair fight. The next day, the couples seem to make amends, but as the day progresses Tony increasingly obsesses over losing the fight to Bobby.

[[Image:Sopranos613b.jpg|left|200px|thumb|[[Bobby Baccalieri|Bobby]] returns to the vacation home after committing his first murder.]]
Tony and Bobby leave for a pre-arranged business meeting. They meet with two [[Quebecers]] who are interested in doing business with Tony. As a part of a business arrangement, Tony agrees to arrange the [[murder]] of one of the Quebecer's former brother-in-law and asks Bobby to take care of it. Back at the vacation home, Carmela and Tony leave for home and Bobby sets off for [[Montreal]], where the man he agreed to murder lives. He finds his target in the laundry room of an apartment building and kills him by shooting him twice.

Back home, Tony watches a [[DVD]] given to him by Janice. Mink calls, informing Tony that the gun charge, though dropped by Essex County, has been picked up by the [[FBI on The Sopranos|FBI]]. Bobby returns to his lake front house, picks up his daughter, and gazes out over the lake.<ref name="EG78">

==Production==
The episode title derives from Janice's birthday present to Tony: a DVD onto which she has had transferred old home movies of them and their [[List of characters from The Sopranos - Friends and Family#Barbara Soprano Giglione|sister]] during their childhood.

"Soprano Home Movies" was the first episode of the final batch of episodes to be produced, following a six-month-long production hiatus. In preparation for shooting the episode, series creator/executive producer David Chase held several rehearsals with the lead actors.<ref name="commentary"/>

The scenes at the lake front vacation home were filmed over two weeks in June 2006 in [[Putnam Valley, New York|Putnam Valley]], New York. Additional interior shots were filmed six months later at [[Silvercup Studios]], New York, where a replica of the cabin had been built in a [[sound stage]]. The lake seen multiple times in the episode is [[Lake Oscawana]]. The scenes of Tony and Bobby fishing were filmed on location on the lake but much closer to the shore than it appears in the episode. The scenes set in Montreal were actually filmed in [[Clinton Hill, Brooklyn]]. Filming of the scenes set in [[New Jersey]] and the Soprano residence took place on location in Essex County, New Jersey and in Silvercup Studios. The ripping of Bobby's shirt when he commits his first murder was not in the script but was added during production.<ref name="commentary">

While filming the cabin fight scene between Tony and Bobby in Silvercup Studios, Steve Schirripa accidentally headbutted James Gandolfini. The fight scene was choreographed but Gandolfini didn't step out of the way in time. His nose was bloodied but not broken. The real headbutting was kept in the episode.<ref name="lvrj">

Gregory Antonacci, who plays Phil Leotardo's advisor [[Butch DeConcini]] on the show, is now billed in the opening credits. [[Joseph R. Gannascoli]] has been removed from the main credits as [[Vito Spatafore|his character]] was murdered two episodes prior to "Soprano Home Movies". The characters [[Dr. Jennifer Melfi]] ([[Lorraine Bracco]]) and [[Junior Soprano]] ([[Dominic Chianese]]) do not appear in the episode but the actors who play them are still listed in the opening credits.
