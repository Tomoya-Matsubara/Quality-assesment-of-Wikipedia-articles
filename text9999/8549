This article traces the [[History of Dallas, Texas|history]] of [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]], [[Texas]] ([[United States|USA]]) during the city's industrial period from 1874 to 1929.

== Modernization ==
The Industrial Period saw Dallas grow from a center of farming and ranching into a major, self-sustaining industrial city.  Near the beginning of the period in 1874, gas lamps began to light Dallas streets and the first telephone line linked the water company to the fire station in 1880 <ref name="historicalsociety">[http://www.dallashistory.org/ Dallas Historical Society] - [http://www.dallashistory.org/history/dallas/dallas_history.htm Dallas History].  Retrieved [[20 April]] [[2006]].</ref>.  In 1888, the [[Dallas Zoo]] opened making it the first zoological garden in the state.<ref>[http://www.dallaszoo.com/general/general.asp?page=gi DallasZoo.com] - [http://www.dallaszoo.com/general/general.asp?page=gi General Information].

== Agricultural Decline ==
The industrial growth in Dallas formed partially out of problems hurting Dallas area farmers:  After buying supplies on credit during the year, farmers owed merchants the majority of their crop.  Costs to ship to the coast were very high, and the price of cotton was dropping.  The [[Farmers' Alliance]], created in 1877, set up a Dallas warehouse to ship cotton to [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], since freight charges were cheaper.  They hoped to break the cycle of poverty, but bankers refused to finance the warehouse, and the venture failed within twenty months <ref name="historicalsociety"/>.

== Outlaws ==
The early industrial period also saw numerous and iconic outlaws. [[Belle Starr]] began her stints in Dallas as a dance hall dancer and singer, and later harbored outlaws and sold stolen horses.  [[Doc Holliday]] came to Dallas to restore his health where he opened a dentist's office, but he soon turned to gambling.  In 1875, he killed a man and left Dallas.  [[Sam Bass]] robbed four trains in the spring of 1878, and that summer, was killed in an ambush near [[Round Rock, Texas|Round Rock]].

== Panic of 1893 ==
In 1890, Dallas annexed the city of [[Old East Dallas|East Dallas]], which was larger geographically than Dallas.  The annexation made Dallas the most populous city in Texas.  In 1893, following the national financial panic, numerous industries and five Dallas banks failed. [[Cotton]] prices dipped below five cents a pound, and the lumber and flour markets had all but vanished.  People began leaving the city.  However, by 1898, the city began to recover and grow again.  The economic panic also affected unionized labor, which had just begun to organize: the [[American Federation of Labor]] granted a charter to the Trades Assembly of Dallas in 1899 <ref name="handbook">[http://www.tsha.utexas.edu/handbook/online/ Handbook of Texas Online] - [http://www.tsha.utexas.edu/handbook/online/articles/DD/hdd1.html DALLAS, TX].  By Jackie McElhaney and Michael V. Hazel.  Retrieved [[20 April]] [[2006]].</ref>.  In 1894, [[Parkland Memorial Hospital]] opened just west of [[Oak Lawn, Dallas|Oak Lawn]].<ref>[http://www.dallasnews.com/ DallasNews.com]: [http://www.dallasnews.com/s/dws/spe/2002/hiddenhistory/1876-1900/vitindex.html Hidden History of Dallas (1876-1900)].  Retrieved [[12 September]] [[2006]].</ref>  In 1903, [[Oak Cliff]], a city across the Trinity River, was annexed.

By the turn of the century Dallas was the leading drug, book, jewelry, and wholesale liquor market in the [[Southwestern United States]].  It also quickly became the center of trade in [[cotton]], [[cereal|grain]], and even [[African Buffalo|buffalo]].  It was the world's leading inland cotton market, and it still led the world in manufacture of [[saddlery]] and [[cotton gin]] machinery <ref name="handbook"/>.  As it further entered the 20th century, Dallas transformed from an agricultural center to a center of [[banking]], [[insurance]], and other businesses.

== 1908 Flood ==
[[Image:Dallas, Texas Trinity Flood 1908.jpg|thumb|center|600px|The Trinity River flooding on 8 July 1908.]]

The relationship between Dallas and the [[Trinity River (Texas)|Trinity River]] had never been what any of the city's forefathers had intended.  The dream of navigation all the way to [[Galveston, Texas|Galveston]] was a dream of many that was never realized.  Floods occurred in 1844, 1866, 1871, and 1890, but none were as bad as the flood of 1908.  On [[26 May]] [[1908]], The Trinity River reached a depth of 52.6 [[foot (unit of length)|feet]] (16.03 [[metre|m]]) and a width of 1.5 [[mile]]s (2.4 [[kilometer|km]]).<ref name="paynechapV">{{cite book |last=Payne |first=Darwin |title= Dallas, an illustrated history |year=1982 |publisher=Windsor Publications |location=Woodland Hills, California |id= ISBN 0-89781-034-1 |pages=119-155 |chapter= Chapter V: A New Century, A New Dallas}}</ref>  Five people died, 4,000 were left homeless, and property damages were estimated at [[United States dollar|$]]2.5 million.

{{cquote|Now the wreckage of a shed or outhouse would move by, followed by a drowned swine or other livestock.  The construction forces of the Texas & Pacific worked feverishly to safeguard the long trestle carrying their tracks across the stream.  Suddenly this whole structure turned on its side down-stream, broke loose from the rest of the track at one end and swung out into the middle of the current and began breaking up, first into large sections and then into smaller pieces, rushing madly along to some uncertain destination.  [Approximately half a dozen of the workmen fell into the torrent at this point; exaggerated reports of their drowning swept the city.]|4=C.L. Moss|5=<ref name="paynechapV"/>}}

Dallas was without power for three days, all telephone and telegraph service was down, and rail service was cancelled.  The only way to reach Oak Cliff was by boat.<ref name="historicalsociety"/>  [[West Dallas]] was hit harder than any other part of the city&mdash;the ''[[Dallas Times Herald]]'' said "indescribable suffering" plagued the area.  Much to the horror of residents, thousands of [[livestock]] drowned in the flood and some became lodged in the tops of trees&mdash;the stench of their decay hung over the city as the water subsided.<ref name="paynechapV"/>

After the disastrous flood, the city wanted to find a way to control the reckless Trinity and to build a bridge linking [[Oak Cliff]] and Dallas.  The immediate reaction was citizens and the city clamoring to build an indestructible, all-weather crossing over the Trinity.  This had already been tried following the 1890 flood&mdash;the result was the "Long Wooden Bridge" that connected Jefferson Boulevard in Oak Cliff and Cadiz in Dallas, but the resulting unstable bridge was easily washed away by the 1908 flood.  [[George Dealey|George B. Dealey]], publisher of the ''[[Dallas Morning News]]'', proposed a 1.5 mile (2.4&nbsp;km) [[concrete]] bridge based on a bridge crossing the [[Missouri River]] in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]].  Ultimately a [[United States dollar|US$]]650,000 bond election was approved and in 1912, the Oak Cliff viaduct (now the Houston Street viaduct) was opened among festivities drawing 58,000 spectators.  The bridge, at the time, was the longest concrete structure in the world.<ref name="paynechapV"/>

Efforts beyond this had begun in 1911 when [[George Kessler]], a city planner, created a plan for both the Trinity and the city.  His plans included using levees to divert the river, removing railroad lines on Pacific Avenue, consolidating rail depots into a central station, new parks and playgrounds, and the straightening and widening of several streets.  Most of his plans lay unimplemented, but in later years, many began to see its importance.  In 1920, Kessler was brought back to update his plan and by the 1930s many of his plans had been realized.<ref name="historicalsociety"/>

== Southern Methodist University ==
By this time, the only thing that the city of Dallas was lacking was a major university. In 1910, efforts began to have Southwestern University in [[Georgetown, Texas|Georgetown]] relocate to Dallas. The school refused, but this action brought Dallas to the attention of the [[Methodism|Methodists]]. They voted in 1911 to establish a university in Dallas, after the city offered $300,000 and 666.5 [[acre]]s (269.7 [[hectare]]s) of land for the campus. In 1915, [[Southern Methodist University]] opened and is still operational today <ref name="historicalsociety"/>.

== Aviation and Financial Center ==
In 1911, Dallas became the location of the [[Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas|eleventh regional branch]] of the [[Federal Reserve System|Federal Reserve]] Bank. The city had campaigned to have it located in Dallas for years, and the bank's arrival assured Dallas's place as a major financial center <ref name="historicalsociety"/>.

In 1912, The [[Adolphus Hotel]] was constructed in [[Downtown Dallas|downtown Dallas]].  The [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux Arts style]] building, at 21-stories and 312 [[foot (unit of length)|feet]] (95&nbsp;[[meter|m]]) was the tallest building in [[Texas]] at the time.  It officially opened on 5 October 1912.  In August 1922, the 29-story [[Magnolia Hotel|Magnolia Petroleum Building]] (now the Magnolia Hotel) opened next door and took the title of tallest-in-Texas <ref>[http://www.dallassky.com/ Dallassky.com] - [http://www.dallassky.com/bldg26.htm Magnolia Building].  Retrieved [[24 August]] [[2006]].</ref>.

Aviation became a major issue in the city in [[World War I]].  [[Love Field]] was established as an aviation training ground, and [[Fair Park]] was the home of [[Camp Dick]], a training facility as well.  The city purchased Love Field in 1927 to use as a municipal airport <ref name="historicalsociety"/>.
