==New Jerusalem Laura==
In 1989, McKenna moved to the [[Fox Chase, Philadelphia|Fox Chase]] neighborhood in [[Northeast Philadelphia]], witnessing the impact of drug addiction on the lives of the residents. She and modern-day hermit [[Richard Withers]], who was then living in a [[Hermitage (religious retreat)|hermitage]] on the grounds of the Sisters' [[motherhouse]], founded New Jerusalem Laura in an attempt to treat drug and alcohol addiction.<ref name=Thompson /> In addition to New Jerusalem, McKenna helped set up the Peacemakers Reflection Center and the Alternate to Violence Project in her community.<ref name=Kolodziej />

The methods that New Jerusalem uses to counsel addicts were influenced by the methods of One Day at a Time, founded by the Rev. Henry Wells.<ref name=Thompson /> For the first 60&nbsp;days of their stay, recovering addicts are prohibited from contacting the outside world, must surrender their cigarettes, and must be escorted if they leave the building. During this time, residents occupy their time with chores, community service, meetings, and Bible study.<ref name=Campellone /> Less than half of all people who enter the program remain after the first 60&nbsp;days.<ref name=Campellone />  After the first 60&nbsp;days, residents' actions are less tightly restricted; however, they are still required to participate in the chores, Bible study, and meetings. Residents graduate from the program after six&nbsp;months.<ref name=Thompson /> 

McKenna feels that the reason for the success of New Jerusalem is the community. "In a recovery community, you can't get away with [lying], because it shows. It forces you to be honest."<ref name=Thompson /> Nearly 400 residents have graduated from the program since its inception.<ref name=MMS /> Of those, close to seventy percent are reported to remain drug-free, well above the results of traditional recovery methods.<ref name=MMS />
