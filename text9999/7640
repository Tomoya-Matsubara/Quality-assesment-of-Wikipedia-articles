'''Erwin Arnada''' (born 17 October 1963) is an Indonesian journalist and filmmaker. Born to a devout Muslim family in [[Jakarta]], Arnada became interested in journalism in 1984, and, after a time as a photographer, he interned at the weekly ''Editor''. Beginning in 1990 he took editorial roles in various print media, including the controversial tabloid ''Monitor''. Arnada entered cinema in 2000, producing several films for Rexinema.

After establishing ''[[Playboy Indonesia]]'' in 2006 Arnada became the center of controversy, as Islamic groups such as the [[Islamic Defenders Front]] protested the magazine as indecent&nbsp;<U+2013> despite it not featuring any nudity. After an extended series of trials Arnada was convicted by the [[Supreme Court of Indonesia]] and sentenced to two years in prison, beginning in October 2010. He was released the following June, when the court reversed its decision. In 2012 Arnada was nominated for a [[Citra Award for Best Director]] for his film ''Rumah di Seribu Ombak'', based on a novel he had written in prison.

==Early life and career==
Erwin Arnada was born on 17 October 1963 to Amin Ismail, a Sumatran trader and part-time journalist, and his wife.{{sfn|Taufiqurrahman 2006, Erwin Arnada}}{{sfn|The Jakarta Globe 2011, Erwin Arnada}}{{sfn|Ginting 2011, Erwin Arnada}} The family owned several shops in [[Jakarta]], including one in [[Blok M]] and another in [[Tanah Abang]]. Beginning when he was in junior high school Arnada helped the family with the shops, using his free time to read.{{sfn|The Jakarta Globe 2011, Erwin Arnada}} Arnada was raised in a Muslim family and has remained a devout Muslim.{{sfn|The Jakarta Globe 2011, Erwin Arnada}}

Arnada attended the [[University of Indonesia]], working towards a degree in [[Russian literature]]. He became interested in journalism through photography. After viewing [[Roger Spottiswoode]]'s 1983 film ''[[Under Fire (film)|Under Fire]]'', which followed an American [[photojournalist]] covering the [[Nicaraguan Revolution]], Arnada applied to be a photographer for the daily newspaper ''[[Kompas]]''. After his application was refused, in 1986 Arnada found work with the Jakarta-based [[association football|football]] team [[Persija Jakarta]].{{sfn|Taufiqurrahman 2006, Erwin Arnada}}{{sfn|The Jakarta Globe 2011, Erwin Arnada}}

==Journalism==
Beginning in 1989 Arnada began an internship with the weekly ''Editor''. He used the position as a learning experience.{{sfn|Taufiqurrahman 2006, Erwin Arnada}}{{sfn|The Jakarta Globe 2011, Erwin Arnada}} Arnada served as an editor of the Jakarta-based tabloid ''Monitor'' between 1990 and 1991. The publication was shut down after it published a controversial poll of readers' most respected figures;{{sfn|The Jakarta Post 2003, Arnada excels}} the poll showed the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]] at number 10, below the ''[[dangdut]]'' singer [[Rhoma Irama]].{{sfn|Taufiqurrahman 2006, Erwin Arnada}}

By the mid-1990s Arnada had begun working for ''Bintang Indonesia'', owned by the [[Ciputra]] family. He left the newspaper in 1999 as he considered the publication to devote too little space to music. He established ''Bintang Milenia'' that year, but by 2002 it had been shut down.{{sfn|Taufiqurrahman 2006, Erwin Arnada}} During this time he worked extensively with [[MTV|MTV Indonesia]] and various start-ups.{{sfn|The Jakarta Globe 2011, Erwin Arnada}}

After the closing of ''Bintang Milenia'', Arnada began working with Indonesian fimmakers Rizal Mantovani, Jose Poernomo and Dimas Djayadiningrat to establish the production company Rexinema.{{sfn|Taufiqurrahman 2006, Erwin Arnada}} The company's first production was ''Jelangkung'' in 2001;{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Rexinema}} Arnada first received credit for ''Tusuk Jelangkung'' in 2002, which he wrote and produced.{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Erwin Arnada}} He worked on a further six films with the company between 2003 and 2007.{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Rexinema}}{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Erwin Arnada}}

==''Playboy Indonesia''==
Arnada began plans to establish ''[[Playboy Indonesia]]'', an Indonesian version of the American men's magazine ''[[Playboy]]'', as a challenge. He considered the magazine more than "[[pornographic magazine|pornography]]", describing it as home to "edgy and award-winning journalism pieces" which he wanted to bring to Indonesia.{{sfn|The Jakarta Post 2013, Erwin Arnada}} Arnada entered discussions with [[Christie Hefner]], then head of [[Playboy Enterprises]], in November 2005. He received permission to publish an Indonesian edition the next January.{{sfn|Taufiqurrahman 2006, Erwin Arnada}} The first issue was launched in April 2006 and did not feature any nudity or focus on sexuality. Instead, the models were fully clothed; the issue also included an interview with author [[Pramoedya Ananta Toer]].{{sfn|The Jakarta Post 2013, Erwin Arnada}} Later articles continued to deal with literature, as well as human rights and politics.{{sfn|The Jakarta Globe 2011, Erwin Arnada}}

The magazine was, however, highly controversial. Before publication Muslim groups had expressed opposition.{{sfn|Taufiqurrahman 2006, Erwin Arnada}} After publication began the ''Playboy Indonesia'' offices were attacked, as were various printers. In one instance the [[Islamic Defenders Front]] attacked the ''Playboy Indonesia'' offices in [[South Jakarta]], leading to the building being evacuated. By May 2006 the continuous protests had left the magazine without an office.{{sfn|Taufiqurrahman 2006, Erwin Arnada}} The bad publicity led advertisers to abandon the magazine. Ultimately the magazine was shut down after releasing ten issues,{{sfn|The Jakarta Post 2013, Erwin Arnada}} having moved to the predominantly Hindu island [[Bali]] since its second issue, in June 2006.{{sfn|Juniartha 2006, 'Playboy' magazine's relocation}}

For his role in ''Playboy Indonesia''{{'s}} publication Arnada came under investigation. Investigators cited his publication of "pornographic" materials, [[pornography in Indonesia|illegal in Indonesia]], as evidence of criminal indecency. On trial in April 2007, the South Jakarta District Court rejected this claim;{{sfn|The Jakarta Post 2013, Former 'Playboy' editor}} an appeal at the Jakarta High Court affirmed this decision.{{sfn|Ginting 2011, Erwin Arnada}} After two years of appeals by prosecutors, the case reached the [[Supreme Court of Indonesia]]. The Supreme Court ruled against Arnada and sentenced him to two years in prison.{{sfn|The Jakarta Post 2013, Former 'Playboy' editor}} In October 2010 Arnada was imprisoned in [[Cipinang Penitentiary Institution]] in Jakarta.{{sfn|The Jakarta Post 2013, Erwin Arnada}} He used this time to write three novels: ''Rumah di Seribu Ombak'' (''House of the Thousand Waves''), ''Midnite di Negeri Nonsense'' (''Midnight in the Land of Nonsense''), and ''Rabbit Versus Goliath''.{{sfn|The Jakarta Globe 2011, Erwin Arnada}}

Arnada was released in June 2011,{{sfn|The Jakarta Post 2013, Erwin Arnada}} after the Supreme Court agreed with his defense that a journalist's professional acts should be tried under the Press Code and not Criminal Code.{{sfn|The Jakarta Post 2013, Former 'Playboy' editor}} Numerous commentators, including Arnada, described it as a victory for the country's [[freedom of press]].{{sfn|The Jakarta Post 2013, Former 'Playboy' editor}} However, responding to calls that he was a hero, Arnada stated "I<U+2019>m not a hero, nor a victim. I<U+2019>m just another version of history"; he considered his experience less drastic than that of journalists elsewhere in the country.{{sfn|Ginting 2011, Erwin Arnada}} In a 2013 interview Arnada stated that his incarceration had "muted his 'insane ambitions'"; Arnada's friends stated that he had been deeply changed by the term.{{sfn|The Jakarta Post 2013, Erwin Arnada}}

==Post-imprisonment==
Arnada released his novel ''Rumah di Seribu Ombak'' in early 2012;{{sfn|The Jakarta Post 2013, Erwin Arnada}} it had been written while he was in prison.{{sfn|The Jakarta Globe 2011, Erwin Arnada}} Set in [[Singaraja]], Bali, the novel followed the friendship of two young boys from different cultural backgrounds.{{sfn|The Jakarta Post 2013, Erwin Arnada}} He adapted the novel later that year, serving as director and producer.{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Erwin Arnada}} The film was a critical success and nominated for nine Citra Awards at the 2012 [[Indonesian Film Festival]], including [[Citra Award for Best Director]] for Arnada. It won four, including Best Editing and Best Screenplay;{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Rumah di Seribu Ombak}} Arnada lost the Best Director award to [[Herwin Novianto]] of ''[[Tanah Surga... Katanya]]'' (''Land of Heaven... They Say'').{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Tanah Surga}}

{{As of|2013}} Arnada is married to Hevie Ursulla Arnada. The couple live in Bali. Arnada has expressed interest in continuing his career as a novelist, ignoring journalism as it offers "nothing new, nothing different."{{sfn|The Jakarta Post 2013, Erwin Arnada}} A movie based on his life is planned by Playboy Enterprises' Alta Loma Entertainment.{{sfn|The Jakarta Post 2013, Erwin Arnada}}
