==History==
The station was founded on September 30, 1962, as '''KCRL-TV'''. It aired an analog signal on VHF channel 4 and was the second television station in Northern Nevada. The call letters became '''KRNV''' on January 22, 1990. The station has always been an NBC affiliate, although it shared [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] with [[KOLO-TV]] until 1967. On March 25, 1997, KENV signed-on as a semi-satellite of KRNV, extending its signal into Northeastern Nevada; it remains the only full-powered television station in Elko. The station operated another satellite, '''KWNV''' channel 7, in [[Winnemucca, Nevada|Winnemucca]], but this went silent on July 1, 2008. KENV started broadcasting digital-only on March 26, 2009, after its analog transmitter broke down and forced a switch to digital.

After the [[DTV transition in the United States|analog television shutdown and digital conversion]] on June 12, KRNV remained on its pre-transition channel number, 7. However, through the use of [[Program and System Information Protocol|PSIP]], digital television receivers continue to display its [[virtual channel]] as 4. The signal for KRNV was relayed on translators K52DN in [[Carson City, Nevada|Carson City]] and K56BW in [[Tahoe City, California]]. These were necessary because the analog transmitter for KRNV was on Red Peak in Reno and operated with limited power to protect [[KRON-TV]] in [[San Francisco]]. With the digital transmitter on Slide Mountain, the translators were no longer necessary and the licenses were canceled.

On December 19, 2006, KRNV began broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition, making it the first station in the market to do so<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvtechnology.com/news/0110/renos-krnv-launches-hd-local-news/192913 |title=Reno's KRNV Launches HD Local News |publisher=TVTechnology |date=2006-12-27 |accessdate=2013-05-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/107009-KRNV_Beats_KREN_to_the_HD_Punch.php |title=KRNV Beats KREN to the HD Punch - 2006-12-20 08:02:00 &#124; Broadcasting & Cable |publisher=Broadcastingcable.com |date= |accessdate=2013-05-19}}</ref> (although local PBS station KNPB became the first in Northern Nevada to offer digital broadcasts, Sept. 2000).

==News operation==
KRNV produces the only midday newscast in the Reno area. Its weeknight 6 o'clock broadcast is the only one at the time.  As a result, KRNV airs ''[[NBC Nightly News]]'' at 5:30. Other stations air national newscasts at 6. Public affairs show ''Ralston Reports'' airs weeknights at 6:30 on KRNV, KENV, and at 7:30&nbsp;pm on [[KSNV-DT]] in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]].  On April 2, 2012, KRNV became the first station to offer a 4:00&nbsp;pm newscast in the market.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mynews4.com/news/story/News-4-at-4-00pm-starts-Monday/FKJ1zd1ruE6W99AS8R4fhA.cspx |title=News 4 at 4:00pm starts Monday - My News 4 - KRNV, Reno, NV |publisher=My News 4 |date= |accessdate=2013-05-19}}</ref>  Other newscasts include a two-hour long ''News 4 Today'' that runs from 5:00&nbsp;am to 7:00&nbsp;am, and News 4 at 11pm.
