{{Main|List of Detroit Tigers broadcasters}}
*Before merging with WXYT-FM, WXYT-AM was the sole flagship station from 2001-2007.

*The Tigers' flagship station was Detroit's [[WJR]] from 1964-2000. As a maximum power [[clear-channel station]], Tigers games could be listened to on WJR from hundreds of miles away on warm, clear nights.

*Other former Tigers flagships include WJBK-AM (currently known as [[WLQV]]) and WKMH-AM (currently known as [[WDTW-AM]]). 

*The Tigers' most famous announcer is [[Baseball hall of fame|Hall of Fame]] Broadcaster [[Ernie Harwell]], who called Tigers games mostly on the radio (but also on TV) from 1960-2002.
