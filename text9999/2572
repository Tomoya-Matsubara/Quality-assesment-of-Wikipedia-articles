'''James Lavadour''' (born 1951) is a [[Walla Walla tribe|Walla Walla]] painter and printmaker. Co-Founder of the [[Crow's Shadow Institute of the Arts]], he is known for creating large panel sets of landscape paintings. 

<blockquote>''I believe that a painting must stand up on its own without explanation. I think of myself as an abstract action painter. I just happen to see landscape in the abstract events of paint.'' - James Lavadour<ref name="Eiteljorg">{{cite web | author= | year=2005 | title=James Lavadour | work=Eiteljorg Fellows | publisher=Eiteljorg Museum | url=http://www.eiteljorg.org/ejm_Collections/Collections/FellowshipForNativeAmericanFineArt/TheFellows/details.asp?id=1070 | accessdate= 4 March 2011}}</ref></blockquote>

==Background==

<blockquote>''I'm a tribal member and grew up on the Umatilla reservation, and I love it there. One of the aspects of tribal life is that the land and I are one.'' - 2005<ref name="Desolation">{{cite web | author=Sheila Farr | year=2005 | title=Desolation, transformation: James Lavadour's landscapes of the mind | work=Visual arts | publisher=The Seattle Times | url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/thearts/2002497889_lavadour16.html | accessdate= 4 March 2011}}</ref></blockquote>

===Early life===

James Lavadour was born in 1951 to parents of [[Chinook people|Chinook]], [[Walla Walla tribe|Walla Walla]], [[German American|German]], [[Irish American|Irish]], [[Assiniboine people|Assiniboine]], and [[French Canadian]] descent in [[Pendleton, Oregon]]. Discovering his love for painting as a child, Lavadour never completed high school, however he was encouraged by his family to explore his artistic endeavors. As a child he was inspired by what he described as "[[Sistine Chapel|The Sistine Chapel]]": the peeling and water stained ceiling of his grandmothers house, with its drips and exposed layers, a visual experience that would influence his work for the rest of his life.<ref name="Desolation"/><ref name=ore>[http://blog.oregonlive.com/visualarts/2008/01/art_preview_james_lavadour_at.html "Art Review: James Lavadour at Hallie Ford."] ''The Oregonian: Oregon Live.''

As a youth, his parents worked at the [[Washington State Penitentiary]] in [[Walla Walla, Washington|Walla Walla]]. A troubled teenager and a poor student, he focused on working at any job he could find: [[delivery boy]], [[canner]], [[janitor]], [[carpenter]], and even a [[firefighter]]. Without opportunities to gain formal artistic training he used books to explore the world of art and culture, including books about: [[Charles Marion Russell]], [[Robert Rauschenberg]], [[Richard Diebenkorn]], [[Pierre Bonnard]], [[J. M. W. Turner]], and [[Franz Kline]]. The major turn for his artistic interest came with exploring Chinese and [[Asian art]], a different creation process where "the kinetic experience is the essence of making art."<ref name="Desolation"/>

===Professional and personal life===

Exhibiting in [[Seattle, Washington]] since the 1970s, Lavadour's first major exhibitions came with his involvement in Sacred Circle, a [[Native American art]] gallery.<ref name="Desolation"/> 

A [[hiker]], Lavadour's exploration of the mountain regions of his home continue to serve as a major source of inspiration for his work today.<ref name="Desolation"/><ref name=ore/><ref name="Portlandart"/><ref name="Schneider"/>

==Fine art career==

<blockquote>''I use two elemental structures, a landscape and an architectural abstraction (a vortex and a grid). There<U+2019>s the flow of landscape and then the intersection of the architectural structure, which is just like being in a room looking out a window, with floors, angles, walls, doors, ceilings, pathways. A painting is a complex event with many things going on at multiple levels. Close, far, color, layers, scrapes, and drips all swirled around by memories. I keep it all organized with structure. Structure is the bed to the river.'' <br />
- James Lavadour<ref name="ButlerGeology">{{cite web | author=Sharon Butler | year=2008 | title=James Lavadour's geology | work= | publisher=Two Coats of Paint | url=http://www.twocoatsofpaint.com/2008/01/james-lavadours-geology.html | accessdate= 4 March 2011}}</ref></blockquote>

Rejecting the [[iconography]] and symbolism inherent in [[Western art]], Lavadour believes that rather than ''trying'' to make his artwork mean something it eventually just became ''something.'' A theory of rejection that he credits to his relationship with the environment and growing up on the Umatilla reservation.<ref name="Desolation"/>

===Early work===

Primarily self-taught, Lavadour grew up exploring his environment on the [[Umatilla Indian Reservation]] and [[Western Oregon]]. His earlier works, reminiscent of [[German romanticism]], displayed what an impact geology and landscape had on his creation process through his own [[monochromatic]] abstract lens (he described these works as his ''Interiors''). Described as "emotional interpretations of the land," these ''Interiors'' tend to look like painted, hazy photograph-like paintings with streaks of color traveling through them.<ref name=ore/><ref name="OfftheMap">{{cite web | author= | year=2006 | title=James Lavadour | work=Off the Map | publisher=National Museum of the American Indian | url=http://www.nmai.si.edu/exhibitions/off_the_map/lavadour.html | accessdate= 4 March 2011}}</ref>

===Current work===

In the 1990s Lavadour started to explore [[printmaking]]. The melding of printmaking with his painting led to complex layer usage in these new works. The layering technique of printmaking makes the geological features of the landscape look like maps or as if they are moving. These new works have also been compared to the art of [[Gerhard Richter]]. He also began to explore other themes, influenced by his interest in [[Chinese painting]], [[abstract expressionism]] and [[jazz music]] (specifically [[John Coltrane]]), however, landscapes continue to be the basis for his work.<ref name=ore/> 

The usage of panels is also seen throughout Lavadour's work, involving selections of works placed together to provide a panorama and visual exploration of the environment through Lavadour's eyes. This allows the artworks to be one major work or many small individual pieces.<ref name=ore/> Today, Lavadour is represented by PDX Contemporary Art, in Portland.

===Creation process===

He wakes up about 3:00 AM every morning to work in his studio on the [[Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation]]. Music serves as an inspiration and a motivator; often jazz music by the likes of some of his favorite artists: John Coltrane, [[Sun Ra]] and [[Miles Davis]].<ref name="Carstens">{{cite web | author=Rosemary Carstens | year=2009 | title=James Lavadour: Landscapes that transcend depictions of place | work=Artist to Watch | publisher=Southwest Art | url=http://www.carstenscommunications.com/articles/09.Lavadour.SWA.PDF | accessdate= 4 March 2011}}</ref>

Lavadour's process generally involves applying layers of paint, then scraping or wiping it away, performing his own form of erosion on his unique landscapes.<ref name="Portlandart"/> He believes there are two major aspects to his work: the capturing of the sediments, layers and shape of the physical scenery, and then an exploration of the energy of that scenery, its emotions and its relationship with the [[cosmos]]. This exploration allows him to discover the physics of the paint - the way it moves on the canvas and its final form, over the color manipulation that many artists often focus on.<ref name="Carstens"/>

===Crow's Shadow Institute of the Arts===

Motivated by his experiences as a fellow at Rutgers University, in 1990 Lavadour co-founded Crow's Shadow Institute of the Arts, a non-profit arts organization that brings "technology, instruction and cultural exchange" to artists on the Umatilla Indian Reservation.<ref name="Eiteljorg"/><ref name="Carstens"/>
