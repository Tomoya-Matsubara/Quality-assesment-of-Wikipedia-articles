The '''Terra Securities scandal''' was a [[scandal]] that became public in November 2007 and involved very speculative investments by eight [[municipalities of Norway]] in various [[hedge fund]]s in the [[United States]] [[bond market]].<ref name="nyt">Mark Landler: [http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/02/world/europe/02norway.html?_r=1&hp&oref=slogin "U.S. Credit Crisis Adds to Gloom in Arctic Norway"] ''New York Times'', December 2, 2007 <small> (Retrieved on December 2, 2007)</small></ref> The funds were sold by [[Terra Securities]] to the municipalities, while the products were delivered by [[Citigroup]]. The muncipalities involved were [[Narvik]], [[Rana, Norway|Rana]], [[Hattfjelldal]] and [[Hemnes]] in [[Nordland]], [[Vik]] and [[Bremanger]] in [[Sogn og Fjordane]], [[Haugesund]] in [[Rogaland]], and [[Kvinesdal]] in [[Vest-Agder]], all large [[hydroelectricity]] producers.

The nature of the investments were that they were very complicated, [[gearing (finance)|geared]] and that they had [[investment risk|high risk]] through a small upside but a very large downside. Terra Securities, now bankrupt, was subsidiary of [[Terra Markets]], that is owned 66.73% by [[Terra-Gruppen]], an [[business alliance|alliance]] and [[branding|co-branding]] company owned by 78 local [[sparebank|savings banks]] in Norway, and the remaining 33.27% by the management of the company. Citigroup is the world's largest bank, and based in the United States.

==Background==
In 2001, Vik municipality found a [[Loophole (law)|loophole]] in the ''Municipality Act'' and invested borrowed money in the [[stock market]], by first investing and then seeking permission later. This utilization of the loophole was confirmed by the [[Norwegian Ministry of Local Government and Regional Development]] in 2002, because the money borrowed was secured in future income. Vik had borrowed [[Norwegian krone|NOK]] 70 million through [[Den norske Bank|DnB Markets]] based on annual payments of NOK 10M, secured through income from hydroelectric power production. This money was then invested in [[Bond (finance)|bond]]s through Terra Securities in 2001 and 2002.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://e24.no/boers-og-finans/article2112738.ece |title=Terra utnyttet smutthull |author=[[E24 N<U+00E6>ringsliv]] |date=2007-11-21 |language=Norwegian}}</ref>

The same year, in 2001, the four municipalities in Nordland, Narvik, Rana, Hemnes and Hattfjelldal borrowed money to invest in complicated bonds issued by Citigroup and sold through Terra Securities. The municipalities also signed a [[confidentiality|confidentiality clause]] with Terra, which ensured that no independent third party could insure the quality of the investments. It has been questioned if such a clause, under the circumstances, could be legal.

For Narvik part of the capital came from the municipality selling 50% of [[Narvik Energi]], the municipal power company, in 2002 to [[DONG Energy]] and [[HelgelandsKraft]]. The other three municipalities had ownership in HelgelandsKraft (Rana 26.8%, Hemnes 7.0% and Hattfjelldal 2.5%) as well as [[property tax]] income from power stations owned by [[Statkraft]]. These municipalities were investing future income from these sources.

The main advisors in Terra were [[Knut Anders Opstad]] and [[Harald Norberg]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dn.no/forsiden/naringsliv/article1248366.ece |title=Terra-r<U+00E5>dgiverne tjente grovt |author=[[Dagens N<U+00E6>ringsliv]] |date=2007-11-27 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> of which the latter has been formerly fined by the [[Norwegian National Authority for the Investigation and Prosecution of Economic and Environmental Crime]] in the early 1990s for illegal sale of bonds to private individuals.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hegnar.no/bors/article236797.ece |title=Terras superselger tidligere straffet |author=[[Finansavisen]] |date=2007-11-21 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> They had tried to sell the investments to all municipalities with power income by contacting the Association of Norwegian Power Municipalities, but had been rejected by the organization.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dn.no/forsiden/politikkSamfunn/article1240264.ece |title=<U+00D8>nsket <U+00E5> selge tapspapirer til alle |author=[[Dagens N<U+00E6>ringsliv]] |date=2007-11-21 |language=Norwegian}}</ref>

==Nature of the investments==
After the reinvestment in 2007 the municipalities gained a potential upside on their investments of between 0.5% and 3.0% above risk-free placements, but instead risked losing not only their entire investment, but in the worst case twice what they invested. A total of NOK 451M was invested, but geared by borrowing additional tenfold of the money, so in reality the municipalities were investing between NOK 4 and 5 billion. In a worst case scenario the municipalities could lose NOK 900M - twice their initial investment. Tor Sydnes in [[Wassum Investment Consulting]] claimed in an interview with [[Dagens N<U+00E6>ringsliv]] that there was an huge disproportion in risk, and the difference in the vast upside and minimal downside was unacceptable: "It is completely ununderstandable that they said yes".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dn.no/forsiden/politikkSamfunn/article1241654.ece |title=Enorm risiko - minimal oppside |author=[[Dagens N<U+00E6>ringsliv]] |date=2007-11-23 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> When translating the [[Prospectus (finance)|prospectus]] from [[English language|English]] to [[Norwegian (language)|Norwegian]], Terra has chosen to systematically not include any warnings of risks that had been in the original prospectus from Citigroup.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dn.no/forsiden/politikkSamfunn/article1241777.ece |title=Terra vedg<U+00E5>r forskjell i prospekter |author=[[Dagens N<U+00E6>ringsliv]] |date=2007-11-22 |language=Norwegian}}</ref>

The model of the investment was so complicated that the CEO of Terra Securities could not confirm that even he actually understood how it worked.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://e24.no/boers-og-finans/article2115784.ece |title=Her er modellen politikerne skulle forst<U+00E5> - pr<U+00F8>v selv |author=[[E24 N<U+00E6>ringsliv]] |language=Norwegian |date=2007-11-22}}</ref> The deficit from the investment came in late 2007 due to the credit bubble in the United States.

The investments made by Haugesund involved NOK 227.5M being placed as a security for Citigroup, so in case loans to United States municipalities were [[default (finance)|defaulted]] beyond 3.32%, Haugesund would have to pay this to Citigroup. The mayor of Haugesund, [[Petter Steen jr.]] claims that he thought the municipality was buying a bond in [[Statkraft]]. Instead they were selling such a bond as security for the hedging they were performing for Citigroup.

Total investments in Terra/Citigroup scheme:
* Bremanger: NOK 170 million
* Hattfjelldal: 103M
* Haugesund: 220M
* Hemnes: 84M
* Kvinesdal 32M
* Narvik: 52M
* Rana: 297M
* Vik: 38.5M

==Scandal reaction==
After [[Finansavisen]] started writing about the case, and the municipalities suspected that they had been conned, they hired expertise from the law firm [[Lund & Co.]] as well the financial advisory firm [[Pareto Group|Pareto]]. The [[Financial Supervisory Authority of Norway]] announced that they would perform an investigation of the case, in relation to the legality of the products sold and the amount of information provided by Terra.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dn.no/forsiden/borsMarked/article1238390.ece |title=Tilsynet gransker Terra |author=[[Dagens N<U+00E6>ringsliv]] |date=2007-11-20 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> [[Minister of Local Government and Regional Development (Norway)|Minister of Local Government and Regional Development]] [[Magnhild Meltveit Kleppa]] asked the [[County Governor|County Governor of Nordland]] to investigate if the agreements made are legal according to the ''Muncipality Act''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://e24.no/makro-og-politikk/article2112768.ece |title=- Vil sjekke lovligheten |author=[[E24 N<U+00E6>ringsliv]] |date=2007-11-21 |language=Norwegian}}</ref>

Terra-Gruppen started an [[internal investigation]], but has only relocated the two advisors and claiming that top management could not be responsible for the questionable behavior of the products. Still [[Sverre Leiro]], CEO of [[NorgesGruppen]] and one of the two independent members of the [[Board of directors|board]] of Terra-Gruppen resigned on [[November 23]], claiming that sitting on the board would tarnish his and NorgesGruppen's [[reputation|image]].

On [[November 26]] Terra announced that they were willing to take the downside of the investments made in 2007 by the four Nordland municipalities, totaling a loss of NOK 150M. This would leave the initial loss at bay, giving a loss for the municipalities of NOK 150M. As of [[November 27]] the municipalities had rejected the offer. Local politicians in Narvik feared that they would have to sell the rest of Narvik Energi if they could not get out of the agreement with Terra.

On [[November 28]] the [[Financial Supervisory Authority of Norway]] announced that they would withdraw all operating licenses held by Terra Securities. Director of the authority, [[Bj<U+00F8>rn Skogstad Aamo]] said the reason was many and serious breaches of requirements for good and correct information to clients.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dn.no/forsiden/naringsliv/article1249754.ece |title=Terra Securities ferdig |author=[[Dagens N<U+00E6>ringsliv]] |date=2007-11-28 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> Subsequent to this the company filed for [[bankruptcy]] and the CEO of Terra-Gruppen, [[Ola Sundt Ravnestad]], announced his resignation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dn.no/forsiden/naringsliv/article1249984.ece |title=Bitter Terra-sjef g<U+00E5>r av |author=[[Dagens N<U+00E6>ringsliv]] |date=2007-11-28 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> Ravnestad will receive NOK 5.5 million in salaries after he retires from the job.

Due to the bankruptcy in Terra Securities, Citigroup announced on [[November 30]], that they would sell the funds on the open market, essentially inflicting a cost of about NOK 350M on the municipalities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://e24.no/boers-og-finans/article2127873.ece |title=Stenger fond |author=[[E24 N<U+00E6>ringsliv]] |date=2007-11-30 |language=Norwegian}}</ref>

===Press coverage===
The incident has been subject to extensive press coverage with headlines and entire first pages in both local and national newspapers, as well as in-depth research articles in the financial press. TV coverage has involved both news and debate programmes on several channels, along with treatments by comedians in comedy shows.

==Involved parties==

(...) The material from Citigroup is significally more detailed than the material from Terra Securities ASA. However, this document is also missing information about crucial risk for the municipalities, namely the risk to have to furnish additional security in the form of money. (...)
