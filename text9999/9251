'''Hurricane Paul''' was the sixteenth tropical storm and tenth hurricane in the [[1982 Pacific hurricane season]]. Making landfall on [[Central America]] as a tropical depression, it unleashed torrential rainfall across the mountainous region, causing deadly mudslides that killed over 1,000. Paul later struck the [[Baja California Peninsula]], where it caused moderate damage as a [[Category 2]] hurricane. The hurricane was the second deadliest Eastern Pacific tropical cyclone of all time, only behind the [[1959 Mexico Hurricane]].

==Meteorological history==
{{storm path|Paul 1982 track.png}}
A large tropical disturbance moved across [[Nicaragua]] from [[September 15]] to the 17th. Convection continued to build, and upon reaching a position {{convert|200|mi|km}} offshore of [[Managua]] on the 18th, the [[Eastern Pacific Hurricane Center]] declared it Tropical Depression Twenty-Two after a circulation developed. Rather than taking the typical Eastern Pacific tropical cyclone track to the west, it drifted northward, a movement caused by its centering between two high pressure cells. Early on the 20th, the depression made landfall in western [[Guatemala]] near the [[El Salvador]] border.<ref name="epac">E. B. Gunther, R. L. Cross, and R. A. Wagoner.

Advisories ceased as the depression remained near the coastline, and in response to a weakening of a high pressure system, it turned westward to reach the Pacific Ocean late on [[September 20]]. Advisories were re-issued, but the circulation was so disrupted by the mountains of Central America that it lost its circulation on the 22nd just off the coast of [[Mexico]]. The remnants continued westward, and the depression reformed on the 24th.<ref name="epac">E. B. Gunther, R. L. Cross, and R. A. Wagoner.

Warm water temperatures of 28-29<U+00B0>C allowed the depression to quickly intensify, and on [[September 26]] it strengthened into Tropical Storm Paul. Paul continued to strengthen as it moved to the northwest, and attained hurricane status late on the 27th. An upper level trough caused the hurricane to accelerate to the north-northeast, resulting in Paul to reach a peak intensity of {{convert|110|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} while just south of [[Baja California (peninsula)|Baja California]] on the 29th. Shortly thereafter, it moved over the southeastern tip of the peninsula, and after crossing the Gulf of California it struck near [[Los Mochis]], in the [[Mexican state]] of [[Sinaloa]] on the 30th as a {{convert|100|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} hurricane. Paul rapidly weakened over land, and dissipated later on [[September 30]].<ref name="epac">E. B. Gunther, R. L. Cross, and R. A. Wagoner.

==Impact==
{{Deadliest Pacific hurricanes}}
Prior to hitting [[Central America]] as a tropical depression, the precursor wave dropped heavy rainfall over the area. After five days of rainfall, rivers greatly overflooded, and resulted in severe mudslides. Through all of Central America, over 1,000 people perished.
===El Salvador===
One such incident occurred in a suburb of [[San Salvador]], where an eight-foot high wall of water covered the town with trees, debris, and ten feet of mud. In addition, hundreds of houses were buried, resulting in a death toll of 300 in the area. In [[El Salvador]], it was the worst disaster since an earthquake in 1965.<ref name="epac">E. B. Gunther, R. L. Cross, and R. A. Wagoner. [http://ams.allenpress.com/archive/1520-0493/111/5/pdf/i1520-0493-111-5-1080.pdf Eastern Pacific Tropical Cyclones of 1982.] Retrieved on [[2008-06-22]].</ref>

===Mexico===
On the [[Baja California (peninsula)|Baja California]] peninsula, wind gusts of up to 120&nbsp;mph (195&nbsp;km/h) were estimated in [[San Jos<U+00E9> del Cabo]], while [[Los Mochis]] on the mainland reported winds of 100&nbsp;mph (160&nbsp;km/h). Strong winds destroyed numerous houses in northwestern Mexico, leaving 9,000 in [[Baja California]] and 24,000 in [[Sinaloa]] homeless. The greatest damage occurred 70&nbsp;miles (110&nbsp;km) south of Los Mochis in the city of [[Guamuchil]], where eight people died when the roof of a building collapsed on them. Crop damage was severe in the state of Sinaloa, where 40% of the soybean crop was destroyed. Corn production was down 26% from the previous year. Sugar cane, tomato, and rice crops were damaged. Total damage in Mexico amounted to $4.5&nbsp;billion Mexican pesos (1982 pesos). <ref>[http://www.eclac.cl/mexico/publicaciones/sinsigla/xml/5/8385/doc2.pdf Rese<U+00F1>a del Impacto de los Principales Desastres.] Retrieved on [[2007-02-11]].</ref>

The name Paul was not retired after this storm, possibly due to the fact it was only a tropical depression when it caused its damage. Thus, the name Paul was reused in [[1994 Pacific hurricane season|1994]], [[2000 Pacific hurricane season|2000]] and [[2006 Pacific hurricane season|2006]].

==Unusual track==
Paul formed unusually far east in the Eastern Pacific at only 90<U+00B0> W. Only four storms are known to have formed further east than Paul; a tropical storm in [[1949 Atlantic hurricane season#Hurricane Ten|late September 1949]],<ref>[[National Hurricane Center]] (2009).
