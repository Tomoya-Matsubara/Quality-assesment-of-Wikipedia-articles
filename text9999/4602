[[File:Warlock1924.jpg|thumb|200px|Philip Heseltine, alias Peter Warlock]]
'''Peter Warlock''' was the [[pseudonym]] of '''Philip Arnold Heseltine''' (30 October 1894 <U+2013> 17 December 1930), an [[England|Anglo]]-[[Wales|Welsh]] composer and music critic. The Warlock name, which reflects Heseltine's interest in occult practices, was used for all his published musical works. He is best known as a composer of songs and other vocal music; he also achieved notoriety in his lifetime through his unconventional and often scandalous lifestyle. 

As a schoolboy at [[Eton College|Eton]], Heseltine came under the spell of the British composer [[Frederick Delius]], with whom he formed a close friendship. After a failed student career in Oxford and London, Heseltine turned to musical journalism, while developing interests in folk-song and [[Elizabethan era#High culture|Elizabethan]] music. His first serious compositions date  from around 1915. Following a period of drift and inactivity, a positive and lasting influence on his work arose from his meeting in 1916 with the Dutch composer [[Bernard van Dieren]]; he also gained creative impetus from a year spent in Ireland, studying [[Celts|Celtic culture and language]]. On his return to England in 1918, Heseltine began composing songs in a distinctive, original style, while building a  reputation as a combative and controversial music critic.  During 1920<U+2013>21 he edited the music magazine ''The Sackbut''. His most prolific period as a composer came in the 1920s, when he was based first in Wales and later at [[Eynsford]] in [[Kent]].

Under his own name, through his critical writings Heseltine made a pioneering contribution to the scholarship of early music. In addition,  he produced a full-length biography of  Delius and also wrote, edited or otherwise assisted the production of several other books and pamphlets. Towards the end of his life Heseltine became depressed by a loss of his creative inspiration; he died in his London flat of [[Coal gas|coal gas]] poisoning in 1930, probably by his own hand.

===Early life===

====Childhood and family background====
[[File:SavoyHotelLondon cropped image.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The Savoy Hotel, London: Philip Heseltine's birthplace (1994 photograph)]]
Heseltine was born on 30 October 1894 at the [[Savoy Hotel]], which his parents were then using as their London residence.<ref>Smith 1994, p. 2</ref> The Heseltines were a wealthy family, with strong artistic connections and some background in classical scholarship.<ref>Smith 1994, p. 4</ref> Philip's parents were Arnold Heseltine, a [[Solicitor|solictor]] in the family  firm, and  Bessie Mary Edith, n<U+00E9>e Covernton. She was the daughter of a country doctor from the Welsh border town of [[Knighton, Powys|Knighton]], and was Arnold's second wife.  Soon after Philip's birth the family moved to  [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]], where he received his first piano lessons and attended a nearby [[kindergarten]].<ref>Parrott, pp. 10<U+2013>11</ref>  

In March 1897 Arnold Heseltine died suddenly at the age of 45; six years later, Bessie married a Welsh landowner and local magistrate, Walter Buckley Jones, and moved to Jones's estate, Cefn-bryntalch Hall, near [[Abermule]] in [[Montgomeryshire]], although the London house was kept on.<ref name= ODNB>{{cite web|authorlink= Barry Smith (organist)|Barry Smith|last= Smith|first= Barry|title= Heseltine, Philip Arnold|url= http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/33843?docPos=1|publisher= Oxford Dictionary of National Biography Online edition|year= 2004|accessdate= 2 September 2012}} {{subscription}}</ref><ref>Parrott, p. 18</ref> The youthful Philip was proud of his Welsh heritage, and retained a lifelong interest in Celtic culture; later he would live in Wales during one of his most productive and creative phases.<ref name= BBCWales>{{cite web|last= Davies|first= Rhian|title= Peter Warlock|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/mid/sites/arts/pages/peter_warlock_biog.shtml|publisher= BBC Mid Wales|date= 29 June 2006|accessdate= 2 September 2012}}</ref> 

In 1903 Philip began at Stone House Preparatory School in [[Broadstairs]], where he showed precocious academic ability and won many prizes.<ref name= ODNB/><ref>Parrott, p. 20</ref> In January 1908, at a concert in the [[Royal Albert Hall]], he heard a performance of ''Lebenstanz'' by [[Frederick Delius]]. The work made little impression on him, until he  discovered that his artist uncle, Arthur Joseph Heseltine (known as "Joe"), lived close to Delius's home in [[Grez-sur-Loing]]. Philip then used the connection  to obtain the composer's autograph for Stone House's music teacher, W.E. Brockway.<ref name= S17>Smith 1994, pp. 17<U+2013>18</ref>

====Eton:  first meeting with Delius====
[[File:Fritz Delius (1907).jpg|thumb|upright|Frederick Delius at around the time of his initial association with Heseltine]]
Philip left Stone House in the summer of 1908, and began at [[Eton College]] that autumn. His biographer Ian Parrott records that Philip loathed Eton, "with its hearty adolescent bawling of Victorian hymns in an all-male college chapel". He was equally unhappy with other aspects of school life, such as the [[Officers' Training Corps]], the suggestive homosexuality and endemic bullying.<ref>Parrott, pp. 20<U+2013>23</ref> He found relief in music and, perhaps because of the connection with his uncle, formed an interest in Delius  that developed into a near-obsession. The boy found a kindred spirit in one of Eton's  music teachers, the cellist Edward Mason, a keen advocate of the composer from whom  Heseltine borrowed a copy of the score of ''[[Sea Drift]]''. He thought it "heavenly", and was soon requesting funds from his mother so that he could buy more of Delius's music.<ref name= S17/>  According to [[Cecil Gray (composer)|Cecil Gray]], Heseltine's first biographer,  "[he] did not rest until he had procured every work of Delius which was then accessible".<ref>Gray 1934, pp. 36<U+2013>37</ref>

In June 1911 Heseltine learned that [[Thomas Beecham]] was to conduct an all-Delius concert at London's [[Queen's Hall]] later that month, at which the composer would be present.  Colin Taylor, a sympathetic Eton piano tutor, secured permission from the school for Heseltine to attend the event. Prior to this, his mother had contrived to meet Delius in her London home; as a consequence, in the interval of the concert Heseltine was introduced to the composer.  The next day he wrote  him a long appreciative letter: "I cannot adequately express in words the intense pleasure it was to me to hear such perfect performances of such perfect music".<ref>Smith 1994, pp. 19<U+2013>21</ref> He told his mother afterwards that "Friday evening was the most perfectly happy evening I have ever spent, and I shall never forget it".<ref name= S22>Smith 1994, pp. 22<U+2013>23</ref> Delius became the first strong formative influence of Heseltine's compositional career, and although the initial worship was later modified,  a friendship began that would largely endure for the remainder of Heseltine's life.<ref name= ODNB/><ref name= GMO>{{cite web|last= Smith|first= Barry|title= Warlock, Peter (Heseltine, Philip Arnold)|url= http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/29912?q=Peter+Warlock&hbutton_search.x=28&hbutton_search.y=12&source=omo_t237&source=omo_gmo&source=omo_t114&search=quick&pos=1&_start=1#firsthit|publisher= Grove Music Online|year= 2007|accessdate= 2 September 2012}} {{subscription}}</ref>

===Cologne, Oxford and London===
By the summer of 1911, a year before he was due to leave the school, Heseltine had tired of life at Eton. Without a clear plan for his future he asked his mother if he could live abroad for a while.   His mother wanted him to go to university, and then either into the [[City of London|City]] or the [[Her Majesty's Civil Service|Civil Service]], but she agreed to his request with the proviso that he would resume his education later. In October 1911 he proceeded to [[Cologne]], to learn German  and study piano at the [[Hochschule f<U+00FC>r Musik und Tanz K<U+00F6>ln|conservatory]].<ref>Smith 1994, pp. 24<U+2013>25</ref> In Cologne, Heseltine produced his first few songs which, like all his earliest works, were highly imitative of Delius.<ref name = Cockshott1940>{{cite journal|last= Cockshott|first= Gerald|title= Some Notes on the Works of Peter Warlock|url= http://www.jstor.org/stable/728361|journal= Music & Letters|volume= 21|issue= 3|date= July 1940|page= p. 246}} {{subscription}}</ref> The piano studies went poorly, although Heseltine  expanded his musical experiences by attending  concerts and operas.

[[File:Tom Quad, Christ Church 2004-01-21.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Christ Church, Oxford, where Heseltine spent an unhappy year, 1913<U+2013>14]]
In March 1912 Heseltine returned to London and began preparation under a private tutor for his university entrance examinations. He  spent time with Delius  at that summer's Birmingham Festival,<ref>Smith 1994, pp. 31<U+2013>36</ref> and in September he published his first music criticism,  an article on [[Arnold Sch<U+00F6>nberg]] that appeared in the ''Musical Standard'' in September 1912.<ref>Parrott, pp. 13<U+2013>14</ref>   Despite his mother's wishes and his lack of formal musical training, he hoped that he could somehow make a career in music. He consulted Delius,  who advised him that, if his mind was set, he should follow his instincts and pursue this objective in the face of all other considerations.<ref>Beecham, p. 175</ref> This advice was later sharply criticised by Beecham, who knew both men, on the grounds of Heseltine's immaturity and instability: "Frederick should never have committed the psychological blunder of preaching the doctrine of relentless determination to someone incapable of receiving it".<ref>Beecham, pp. 175 and p. 179</ref> In the event, Heseltine acceded to his mother's plans; after passing the necessary examinations he was accepted to study classics at [[Christ Church, Oxford]], and began there in October 1913.<ref>Smith 1994, p. 38</ref> 

A female acquaintance at Christ Church described the 19-year-old Heseltine  as "probably about 22,  but he appears to be years older ... 6 feet high, absolutely fit ... brilliant blue eyes ... and the curved lips and highhead carriage of a young Greek God".<ref>Smith 1994, p. 55</ref> Although he enjoyed social success, he soon became depressed and unhappy with Oxford life. In April 1914 he spent part of his Easter vacation with Delius, at Grez, and worked with the composer on the scores of ''An Arabesque'' and ''[[Fennimore and Gerda]]'', in the latter case providing an English version of the [[libretto]].<ref>Smith 1994, p. 60</ref><ref>{{cite web|last= Anderson|first= Robert|title= Fennimore and Gerda|url= http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/O007819?q=Peter+Warlock&hbutton_search.x=27&hbutton_search.y=5&source=omo_epm&source=omo_t237&source=omo_gmo&source=omo_t114&search=quick&pos=23&_start=1#firsthit|publisher= Grove Music Online|accessdate= 24 September 2012}} {{subscription}}</ref> He did not return to Oxford after the 1914 summer vacation; with his mother's reluctant consent he moved  to [[Bloomsbury]] in London, and enrolled at [[University College London]] for a course in language, literature and philosophy.<ref name= S68>Smith 1994, pp. 68<U+2013>69</ref> In his spare time he conducted a small amateur orchestra in [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]], after admitting to Delius that he knew nothing of the art of conducting.<ref>Gray 1934, p. 97</ref> However, his life as a student in London was brief; in February 1915, with the help of [[Maud Cunard|Lady Emerald Cunard]] (a mistress of Beecham) he  secured a job as a music critic for the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' at a salary of <U+00A3>100 per year. He promptly abandoned  his university studies to begin this new career.<ref name= S68/>

===Unsettled years===

====Music critic====
During Heseltine's four months at the ''Daily Mail'', he wrote about 30 notices, mainly short reports of musical events but occasionally with some analysis.<ref name= S68/> His first contribution, dated 9 February 1915, described a performance by [[Benno Moiseiwitsch]] of Delius's Piano Concerto in C minor; Delius was hailed as "the greatest composer England has produced for two centuries", Moiseiwitsch's rendering of the piece was  "masterly". The other work in the programme was "the last great symphony that has been delivered to the world": the [[Symphony in D minor (Franck)|Symphony in D minor]] by [[C<U+00E9>sar Franck|Franck]].<ref>Fenby (ed.) 1987, p. 2</ref> He wrote  for other publications; a 5000-word article, "Some notes on Delius and his Music", appeared in the March 1915 issue of ''[[The Musical Times]]''.,<ref name= S68/><ref>Fenby (ed.) 1987, pp. 3<U+2013>9</ref> in which Heseltine opined: "There can be no superficial view of Delius's music: either one feels it in the very depths of one's being, or not at all". Only Beecham, Heseltine suggested, was capable of interpreting the music adequately.<ref name=heseltine>{{cite journal|title= Some Notes on Delius and His Music|last= Heseltine|first= Philip|jstor= 909510|journal= The Musical Times|volume= 56|issue= 865|pages= pp. 137<U+2013>42|date= March 1915}} {{subscription}}</ref> Heseltine's last notice for the ''Daily Mail'' was dated 17 June;<ref>Fenby (ed.) 1987, p. 11</ref> later that month he resigned, frustrated by the paper's frequent cutting of his critical reviews.<ref>Smith 1994, p, 70</ref> Unemployed, he spent his days in the [[British Museum]], studying and editing [[Elizabethan era#High culture|Elizabethan]] music.<ref name= GMO/>

====New friends and acquaintances====

With time on his hands, Heseltine spent much of the 1915 summer in a rented holiday cottage in the [[Vale of Evesham]], with a party that included a young artists' model, Minnie Lucie Channing, who was known as "Puma" because of her volatile temperament. She and Heseltine were soon engaged in a passionate love affair.<ref>Smith 1994, pp. 71<U+2013>72</ref> During this summer break Heseltine shocked neighbours by his uninhibited behaviour, which included riding a motorcycle down nearby [[Crickley Hill and Barrow Wake|Crickley Hill]], completely naked.<ref>Copley 1979, p. 23</ref>{{#tag:ref|An attempt in 2001 by members of the Peter Warlock Society to re-enact the naked ride was thwarted by local police, who threatened to arrest anyone who tried it.<ref>{{cite web|title= Naked Capers|url= http://www.peterwarlock.org/Caper.htm|publisher= The Peter Warlock Society|accessdate= 6 October 2012}}</ref> |group= n}} However, his letters  show that at this time he was often depressed and insecure, lacking any clear sense of purpose.<ref name= ODNB/>  In November 1915 his life gained some impetus when he met [[D.H. Lawrence]] and the pair found an immediate rapport. Heseltine declared Lawrence to be "the greatest literary genius of his generation",<ref>Smith 1994, pp. 76<U+2013>77</ref> and enthusiastically fell in with the writer's plans to found a [[Utopian socialism|Utopian]] colony in America. In late December he followed the Lawrences to Cornwall, where he tried, unavailingly, to set up a publishing company with them.<ref name= GMO/> Passions between Heseltine and Puma had meanwhile cooled;  when she became pregnant, Heseltine confided to Delius that he had little liking for her and had no intention of helping her to raise this unwanted child.<ref>Smith 1994, pp. 84<U+2013>85</ref>
[[File:William Orpen The Caf<U+00E9> Royal, London.jpg|thumb|upright|The Cafe Royal circa 1912, a frequent meeting place for Heseltine and his friends]]
In February 1916 Heseltine returned to London, ostensibly to clarify his exemption from military service. However, it became clear that there had been a rift with Lawrence;  in a letter to his friend [[Robert Nichols (poet)|Robert Nichols]], Heseltine described Lawrence as "a bloody bore determined to make me wholly his and as boring as he is".<ref>Smith 1994, pp. 90<U+2013>94</ref> The social centre of Heseltine's life now became the [[Caf<U+00E9> Royal]], in [[Regent Street]], where among others  he met  Cecil Gray, a young Scottish composer. The two decided to share a [[Battersea]] studio, where they planned various schemes together, including a new music magazine,<ref>Smith 1994, pp. 94<U+2013>97</ref> and, more ambitiously, a season of operas and concerts. Heseltine declined an offer from Beecham to participate in the latter's English Opera Company, writing to Delius that Beecham's productions and choices of works were increasingly poor and lacking in  artistic value; in his own venture there would be "no compromise with the mob".<ref>Gray 1934, p. 131</ref> Beecham ridiculed the plan; it would, he said,  "be launched and and controlled by persons without the smallest experience of theatrical life".<ref>Beecham, pp. 175<U+2013>77</ref> The idea eventually came to nothing.  An  event of considerable significance in Heseltine's musical life, late in 1916, was his introduction to the Dutch composer [[Bernard van Dieren]]. This meeting began a friendship that provided a lasting infuence on Heseltine, who for the rest of his life continued to promote the older composer's music.<ref>Smith 1994, pp. 98<U+2013>99</ref> In November 1916 Heseltine used the pseudonym "Peter Warlock" for the first time, in an article on [[Sir Eugene Aynsley Goossens|Eugene Goossens's]] chamber music for ''The Music Student''.<ref name= S103>Smith 1994, pp. 103<U+2013>04</ref><ref>Parrott, p. 44</ref>{{#tag:ref|Smith records that the reason for the choice of name is unknown. A [[warlock]] is a male witch, a sorcerer or magician. The choice precedes Heseltine's active interest in occult practices; Smith surmises that, at a time when black magic and the occult were popular topics, Hesltine may have been subconsciously influenced towards this choice.<ref name= S103/> |group= n}}

Puma gave birth to a son in July 1916, though there is confusion about the exact identity of the child. Most biographers have assumed this to be [[Nigel Heseltine]], the future writer who published a memoir of his father in 1992. However, in this account, Nigel denies that Puma was his mother; he was, he says, the result of a concurrent liaison between Heseltine and an unnamed Swiss girl. Subsequently he was given to foster-parents, then adopted  by Heseltine's mother.<ref>N. Heseltine, p. 123</ref> Parrott records that the son born to Puma was called Peter, and died in infancy.<ref>Parrott, pp. 24<U+2013>25</ref> Smith, however, states that Puma's baby was originally called Peter but was renamed Nigel "for reasons which have not as yet been satisfactorily explained". Whatever the truth of the paternity, and  in spite of their mutual misgivings, Heseltine and Puma were married at Chelsea Registry Office on 22 December 1916.<ref>Smith 1994, pp. 106<U+2013>07</ref>

====Ireland====
By April 1917 Heseltine had again tired of London life. He returned to Cornwall where he rented a small cottage near to that of the Lawrences, and made a partial peace with the writer.  By the summer of 1917, as Allied fortunes in the war stagnated,  Heseltine's military exemption came under review; to forestall the possibility of conscription, in August 1917 he moved to Ireland, taking Puma, with whom he had decided he was, after all, in love.<ref>Smith 1994, pp. 110<U+2013>20</ref>
[[File:Facade Abbey Theatre Dublin.jpg|thumb|left|The Abbey Theatre, Dublin (2006 photograph), where Heseltine delivered his "What Music Is" lecture in May 1918]]
In Ireland, Heseltine combined studies of early music with a fascination for Celtic languages, withdrawing for a two-month period to a remote island  where [[Irish language|Irish]] was spoken exclusively.<ref>Smith 1994, pp. 125<U+2013>27</ref> Another preoccupation was an increasing fascination with magical and occult practices, an interest first awakened during his Oxford year and revived in Cornwall.<ref name= GMO/> A letter to his friend Robert Nichols indicates that at this time he was  "tamper[ing] ... with the science vulgarly known as Black Magic". To his former tutor Colin Taylor, Heseltine enthused about books "full of the most astounding wisdom and illumination"; these works included [[Eliphas Levi]]'s ''History of Transcendental Magic'', which includes procedures for the invocation of demons.<ref>Smith 1994, pp. 130<U+2013>34</ref> These diversions did not prevent Heseltine from participating in Dublin's cultural life. He met [[W.B. Yeats|Yeats]], a fellow-enthusiast for the occult, and briefly considered writing an opera based on the ninth century Celtic folk-tale of Liadain and Curithir.<ref>Parrott, p. 72</ref> The composer [[Denis ApIvor]] has suggested that Heseltine's obsession with the occult was finally curbed through his interactions in Dublin with a [[Theosophy|theosophist]] group, which reawakened an  interest in religious philosophies to which he had been first introduced by [[Kaikhosru Shapurji Sorabji|Kaikhosru Sorabji]], the composer who had first sparked Heseltine's interest in the music of [[B<U+00E9>la Bart<U+00F3>k|Bart<U+00F3>k]].<ref name= ApIvor>ApIvor, pp. 187<U+2013>195</ref>

On 12 May 1918 Heseltine delivered a well received illustrated lecture, "What Music Is", at Dublin's [[Abbey Theatre]], which included musical excerpts from Bart<U+00F3>k, the French composer [[Paul Ladmirault]], and van Dieren.<ref>Parrott, p. 31</ref><ref>Smith 1994, p. 136</ref> Heseltine's  championship of van Dieren's music led in August 1918 to a vituperative war of words with the music publisher Winthrop Rogers, over the latter's rejection of several van Dieren compositions. This dispute stimulated Heseltine's own creative powers, and in his final two weeks in Ireland  he wrote ten songs, including some later acknowledged by critics as among his finest work.<ref name= ODNB/><ref>Smith 1994, pp. 145<U+2013>51</ref>

====Journalism and ''The Sackbut''====
When Heseltine returned to London at the end of August 1918 he sent seven of his recently composed songs to Rogers for publication. Because of the recent contretemps  over van Dieren, Heseltine submitted  these pieces as "Peter Warlock".  They were published under this pseudonym, which he thereafter adopted for all his subsequent musical output, reserving his own name  for critical and analytical writings.<ref name= ODNB/><ref name= GMO/> At around this time the composer [[Charles Wilfred Orr]] recalled Heseltine, "a tall fair youth of about my own age",  trying without success to convince a sceptical Delius of the merits of van Dieren's piano works. Orr was particularly struck by Heseltine's whistling abilities which he describes as  "flute-like in quality and purity".<ref>Palmer, pp. 174<U+2013>75</ref> 

For the next few years Heseltine devoted most of his energy to musical criticism and journalism.  In May 1919 he delivered a paper to the Musical Association, "The Modern Spirit in Music", that impressed [[Edward Joseph Dent|E.J. Dent]], the future [[Cambridge University]] music professor. However, much of his writing was confrontational and quarrelsome. He made dismissive comments about the current standards of musical criticism ("the average newspaper critic of music ... is either a shipwrecked or worn-out musician, or else a journalist too incompetent for ordinary reporting") which offended senior critics such as [[Ernest Newman]]. He wrote provocative articles in the ''Musical Times'', and in July 1919 feuded with  the composer-critic Leigh Henry over the music of [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]].<ref name= Smith160>Smith 1994, pp. 160<U+2013>63</ref> 

In a letter dated 17 July 1919, Delius  advised the younger man to concentrate either on writing or composing: "I&nbsp;... know how gifted you are and what possibilities are in you".<ref>Beecham, p. 180</ref> By this time, Heseltine's privately expressed opinions on Delius's music were increasingly critical, although in public he continued to sing his former mentor's praises.<ref>Smith 1994, pp. 158<U+2013>59</ref> In  ''The Musical Times'' he cited ''Fennimore and Gerda'', Delius's final opera, as "one of the most successful experiments in a new direction that the operatic stage has yet seen".<ref>{{cite journal|last= Heseltine|first= Philip|title= Delius's New Opera|journal= The Musical Times|volume= 61|issue= 926|date= April 1920|pages= p. 237}}</ref> 

Heseltine had long nurtured a scheme to launch a music magazine, which he intended to start as soon as  he found apppropriate backing. In April 1920, Rogers decided to replace a semi-moribund magazine he owned, ''The Organist and Choirmaster'', with a new music journal, ''The Sackbut'', and invited Heseltine  to edit it.<ref name= GMO/> Heseltine presided over nine issues, adopting a style that was combative and often controversial.<ref>{{cite web|title= Warlock: The Curlew|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00grmq5|work= Discovering Music|publisher= [[BBC Radio 3]]|accessdate= 15 September 2012}}</ref>  ''The Sackbut'' also organised concerts,  which presented works by van Dieren, Sorabji, Ladmirault and others.<ref>Kemp, p. 46</ref><ref>Smith 1994, pp. 172<U+2013>73</ref> However, Rogers  withdrew his financial backing after five issues. Heseltine then struggled to run it himself for several months;  in September 1921 the magazine was taken over by  the publisher John Curwen, who promptly replaced Heseltine as editor.<ref>Smith 1994, p. 176 and p. 185</ref>

===Productive years in Wales===

With no regular income, in the autumn of 1921 Heseltine returned to  Cefn-bryntalch, which became his base for the next three years. He found the atmosphere there conducive to work, writing to Gray that "Wild Wales holds an enchantment for me stronger than wine or woman".<ref>Smith 1994, p. 188</ref> The Welsh years were marked by intense creative compositional and literary activity; some of Heseltine's best-known music, including the song-cycles ''Lilligay'' and ''[[The Curlew]]'', were completed along with numerous songs,  choral settings, and a strings serenade composed to honour Delius's 60th birthday in 1922. Heseltine also edited and transcribed a large amount of early English music.<ref name= PWS>{{cite web|title= Life and Works|url= http://www.peterwarlock.org/lifeworks.htm|publisher= The Peter Warlock Society|accessdate= 18 September 2012}}</ref><ref>Smith 1994, p. 187 and p. 217</ref>  His  recognition as an emerging composer was marked by the selection of ''The Curlew'' as one of the works representing contemporary British music at the 1924 [[Salzburg Festival]].<ref>Smith 1994, p. 216</ref>
[[File:Aranyi and Bartok.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Bela Bart<U+00F3>k]] (right), pictured with the violist [[Jelly d'Ar<U+00E1>nyi]] during their British tour, 1922]]
Heseltine's major  literary work of this period was the completion of a biography of Delius,  the first full-length study of the composer, which remained the standard work for many years.<ref>Beecham, p. 9</ref> On its reissue in 1952 the book was described by the music publisher [[Hubert J. Foss]] as "a work of art, a charming and penetrating study of a musical poet's mind".<ref>Smith 1994, p. 201</ref>  Heseltine also worked with Gray on a study of the 16th-century Italian composer [[Carlo Gesualdo]], although disputes between the collaborators meant that the book was not published until 1926.<ref name= S217/> 

In April 1921, on a visit to [[Budapest]], Heseltine had befriended the then little-known Hungarian composer and pianist [[Bela Bart<U+00F3>k]].  When Bart<U+00F3>k visited Wales in March 1922 to perform in a concert, he stayed for a few days at Cefn-bryntalch. Although Heseltine continued to promote Bart<U+00F3>k's music, there are no records of further meetings after the Wales visit.<ref>Smith 1994, p. 203</ref>  Heseltine's on-off friendship with Lawrence finally died, after a thinly disguised and unflattering depiction of Heseltine and Puma ("Halliday" and "Pussum") appeared in ''[[Women in Love]]'', published in 1922. Heseltine began legal proceedings for defamation, eventually settling  out of court with  the publishers, [[Secker and Warburg]].<ref>Smith 1994, pp. 191<U+2013>93</ref> Puma, meanwhile, had disappeared from Heseltine's life. She had returned from Ireland before him, and had lived for a while with the young child Nigel at Cefn-bryntalch where the local gentry considered her "not of the same order of society as we are".<ref>Parrott, p. 61</ref><ref>N. Heseltine, p. 107</ref>  There was no resumption of married life, and she left Heseltine some time in 1922.<ref name= ODNB/>

In September and October 1923 Heseltine accompanied his fellow-composer [[E.J. Moeran]] on a tour of eastern England, in search of original folk music, and later that year visited Delius at Grez-sur-Loing in the company of Gray.<ref>Smith 1994, pp. 212<U+2013>13</ref> In June 1924 he left  Cefn-bryntalch and lived briefly in a Chelsea flat, a stay marked by wild parties and considerable damage to the property. After spending Christmas 1924 in [[Majorca]] he took the lease of a cottage (formerly occupied by Foss) in the Kent village of [[Eynsford]].<ref name= S217>Smith 1994, pp. 217<U+2013>20</ref>

===Eynsford===
[[File:Eynsford ford.jpg|thumb|left|The village of Eynsford in Kent, Heseltine's home between 1925 and 1928]] 
At Eynsford, with Moeran as his co-tenant, Heseltine presided over a bohemian household with a flexible population of artists, musicians and friends. Moeran had studied at the [[Royal College of Music]] before and after the First World War; he was an avid collector of folk music and, like Heseltine, had been a youthful admirer of Delius.<ref>{{cite web|last= Dibble|first= Jeremy|title= Moeran, Ernest John|url= http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/opr/t114/e4481?q=E.J.+Moeran&hbutton_search.x=23&hbutton_search.y=10&source=omo_t237&source=omo_gmo&source=omo_t114&search=quick&pos=2&_start=1#firsthit|publisher= The Oxford Companion to Music Online edition|accessdate= 19 September 2012}} {{subscription}}</ref> Although they had much in common, he and Heseltine rarely worked together, though they collaborated to produce the song "Maltworms".<ref>Parrott, p. 96</ref> The other permanent Eynsford residents were Barbara Peache, Heseltine's long-term girlfriend whom he had known since the early 1920s, and  Hal Collins, a New Zealand [[M<U+0101>ori people|M<U+0101>ori]] who acted as a general [[Wikt:factotum|factotum]].<ref name= S222>Smith 1994, pp. 222<U+2013>27</ref> Peache was described by Delius's assistant [[Eric Fenby]] as "a very quiet, attractive girl, quite different from Phil's usual types".<ref name= S222/> Although not formally trained, Collins was a gifted graphic designer and occasional composer, who sometimes assisted Heseltine.<ref>Gray 1934, pp. 254<U+2013>55</ref> The household was augmented at various times by the composers [[William Walton]]<ref name= ApIvor/> and [[Constant Lambert]], the artist [[Nina Hamnett]], and sundry acquaintances of both sexes.<ref name= S222/> 

The ambience at Eynsford was one of alcohol (the "Five Bells" public house was conveniently across the road) and uninhibited sex; these years are the primary basis for the Warlock legends of wild living and debauchery.<ref name= ODNB/> Visitors to the house have left accounts of orgies, all-night drunken parties, and rough horseplay that at least once brought police intervention.<ref>Smith 1994, pp. 220<U+2013>26</ref> However, such activities were mainly confined to weekends;  within this unconventional milieu Heseltine accomplished much work, including settings from the [[English literature#Jacobean literature|Jacobean]] dramatist [[John Webster]] and the modern poet [[Hilaire Belloc]], and the  ''[[Capriol Suite]]'' in versions for string and full orchestra.<ref name= GMO/><ref name= PWS/> Heseltine continued with his transcriptions of early music, wrote articles and criticism, and finished the book on Gesualdo.  He attempted to restore the reputation of a neglected Elizabethan composer, [[Thomas Whythorne]], with a long pamphlet which, years later, brought significant amendments to Whythorne's entry in ''The History of Music in England''. He also wrote a general study of Elizabethan music, ''The English Ayre''.<ref>Smith 1994, pp. 234<U+2013>35</ref>  

In January 1927 the strings serenade was recorded for the [[National Gramophonic Society]], by [[John Barbirolli]] and an improvised chamber orchestra. A year later, [[His Master's Voice|HMV]] recorded the ballad "Captain Stratton's Fancy", sung by [[Peter Dawson (bass-baritone)|Peter Dawson]]. These two are the only recordings of Heseltine's music issued in his lifetime.<ref>Smith 1994, p. 244 and p. 250</ref> His association with the poet and journalist [[Bruce Blunt]] led to  the popular Christmas anthem "[[Bethlehem Down]]", which the pair wrote in 1927 to raise money for their Christmas drinking.<ref>Smith 1994, pp. 249<U+2013>50</ref> By the summer of 1928 his general lifestyle had created severe financial problems, despite his industry. In October  he was forced to give up the cottage at Eynsford, and returned to Cefn-bryntalch.<ref>Smith 1994, pp. 251<U+2013>52</ref>

===Final years===
In November 1928, bored with life at Cefn-bryntalch, Heseltine moved back to London. He sought concert reviewing and cataloguing assignments without much success; his main creative activity  was the editing, under the pseudonym "Rab Noolas" ("Saloon Bar" backwards),  of ''Merry-Go-Down'', an  anthology in praise of drinking.  The book, published by The Mandrake Press, was copiously illustrated by Hal Collins.<ref>Smith 1994, pp. 253<U+2013>56 and p. 263</ref>
[[File:Beecham-1910-crop.jpg|thumb|upright|Sir Thomas Beecham, who temporarily revived Heseltine's career in 1929]]
Early in 1929 Heseltine received two offers from Beecham which temporarily restored his sense of purpose. Beecham had founded the Imperial League of Opera (ILO) in 1927; he now  invited Heseltine to edit the ILO journal.<ref name= GMO/><ref>Smith 1994, p. 259</ref> Beecham also asked Heseltine to help organise a festival to honour Delius, which the conductor was planning for October 1929.<ref>Beecham, pp. 200<U+2013>01</ref> Although Heseltine's enthusiasm for Delius's music was diminished, he accepted Beecham's assignment, and travelled to Grez  in search of forgotten compositions  that could be resurrected for the festival.<ref>Jenkins, p. 43</ref> He was delighted to discover [[Cynara (Delius)|''Cynara'']], for voice and orchestra, abandoned since 1907,<ref>Fenby 1981, pp. 69<U+2013>70</ref> though Fenby  was shocked by Heseltine's private disparaging of much of Delius's work.<ref>Fenby 1981, p. 60</ref>  For the festival, Heseltine  prepared many of the programme notes for individual concerts and supplied a concise biography of the composer.<ref>Fenby (ed.) 1987, pp. 38<U+2013>63</ref> According to Delius's wife [[Jelka Rosen|Jelka]]: "Next to Beecham, he really was the soul of the thing".<ref>Parrott, p. 93</ref>

At a [[The Proms|Promenade Concert]] in August 1929, Heseltine conducted a performance of the ''Capriol Suite'', the single public conducting engagement of his life.<ref name= S263/>  In an effort to reproduce their success with "Bethlehem Down", he and Blunt proffered a new carol for Christmas 1929, "The Frostbound Wood"; technically accomplished, this failed to achieve the popularity of its predecessor.<ref>Copley 1979, p. 141</ref> Heseltine edited three issues of the ILO journal; then, in January 1930, Beecham announced the closure of the venture, and Heseltine was out of work again.<ref>Copley 1979, p. 18</ref> His attempt on behalf of van Dieren to raise finance to mount a performance of the latter's opera ''The Tailor'' also failed.<ref>Smith 1994, pp. 269<U+2013>70</ref> 

The final summer of Heseltine's life was marked by gloom, depression, and inactivity; ApIvor refers to Heseltine's sense of "crimes against the spirit", and an obsession with imminent death.<ref>{{cite journal|last= ApIvor|first= Denis|title= Philip Heseltine: A Psychological Study|journal= Music Review|issue= 46|year= 1985|pages= pp. 118<U+2013>32}}</ref> In July 1930 a fortnight spent with Blunt in  [[Hampshire]]  brought a brief creative revival; Heseltine composed "The Fox" to Blunt's lyrics, and on his return to London he wrote "The Fairest May" for voice and string quartet. These were his final original compositions.<ref>Smith 1994, pp. 274<U+2013>75 and p. 278</ref><ref>Parrott, p. 37</ref>

===Death===
In September 1930 Heseltine moved with Barbara Peache into a basement flat at 12a [[Tite Street]] in Chelsea. With no fresh creative inspiration, he worked in the British Museum on transcriptions of music by the English composer [[Cipriani Potter]], and made a solo version of "Bethlehem Down" with organ accompaniment. On the evening of 16 December Heseltine met with van Dieren  and his wife for a drink, and invited them  home afterwards. According to van Dieren, the visitors left at about 12.15 am. Neighbours later reported sounds of movement and of a piano, in the early hours of the morning.  When  Peache, who had been away, returned early on 17 December, she found the doors and windows bolted, and smelt gas. The police broke into the flat where they found Heseltine unconscious; he was declared dead shortly afterwards, apparently as the result of coal gas poisoning.<ref>Smith 1994, pp. 276<U+2013>80</ref><ref>Gray 1934, p. 290</ref> 

An inquest was held on 22 December;  the jury could not determine whether the death was accidental or suicide, and an open verdict was returned.<ref>Gray (1934), p. 295</ref> Most commentators have considered suicide the more likely cause; Heseltine's close friend Lionel Jellinek and Peache both recalled that he had previously threatened to take his life by gas, and the outline of a new will was found among the papers in the flat.<ref>Smith 1994, pp. 281<U+2013>83</ref>  Much later, Nigel Heseltine introduced a new theory<U+2014>that his father had been murdered by van Dieren, the sole beneficiary of Heseltine's 1920 will which stood to be revoked by the new one. This theory is not considered tenable by most commentators.<ref name= Parrott34>Parrott, pp. 34<U+2013>41</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last= Banfield|first= Stephen|title= Moeran, Warlock and Song|url= http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/946634?uid=3738032&uid=2129&uid=2&uid=70&uid=4&sid=21101122584997|journal= Tempo ''New series''|issue= 215|date= January 2001|pages= pp. 7<U+2013>9}} {{subscription}}</ref> 

Heseltine was buried alongside his father, at [[Godalming]] cemetery, on 20 December 1930.<ref name= ODNB/>  At the end of February 1931 a memorial concert of his music was held at the [[Wigmore Hall]]; a second such concert took place in the following December.<ref name= Cop1>{{cite journal|last= Copley|first= I.A.|title= Peter Warlock's Choral Music|url=  http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/732851?uid=3738032&uid=2&uid=4&sid=21101240150227|journal= Music & Letters|volume= 45|issue= 4|date= October 1964|pages= p. 318}} {{subscription}}</ref> In 2011 the art critic [[Brian Sewell]] published his memoirs, in which he revealed that he was Heseltine's illegitimate son, born in July 1931 seven month's after the composer's death. Sewell's mother, unnamed, was an intermittent girlfriend, a [[Roman Catholic]]  who refused Heseltine's offer to pay for an abortion. She believed that this refusal was a factor that had led to Heseltine's suicide, and thereafter carried a burden of guilt. Sewell was unaware of his father's identity until 1986.<ref>Sewell, pp. 17<U+2013>23</ref>

===Legacy===
Heseltine's surviving body of work includes about 150 songs, mostly for solo voice and piano. He also wrote  choral pieces, some with instrumental or orchestral accompaniment, and a few purely instrumental works.<ref>Copley 1979, pp. 295<U+2013>309</ref> Among  lost or destroyed works the musicologist Ian Copley lists two stage pieces: sketches for the abandoned opera ''Liadain and Curither'', and the  draft of a mime-drama ''Twilight'' (1926) which  Heseltine destroyed on the advice of Delius.<ref>Gray 1934, p. 142</ref><ref>Copley 1979, pp. 291<U+2013>92</ref> The music historian Stephen Banfield describes the songs as  "polished gems of English art song forming a pinnacle of that genre's brilliant brief revival in the early 20th century ... [works of] intensity, consistency and unfailing excellence".<ref>{{cite journal|last= Banfield|first= Stephen|title= Moeran, Warlock and Song|url= http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/946634?uid=3738032&uid=2&uid=4&sid=21101242035797|journal= Tempo ''New series''|issue = 215|date= January 2001|pages= pp. 7<U+2013>9}} {{subscription}}</ref> According to Delius's biographer Christopher Palmer, Heseltine influenced the work of fellow-composers Moeran and Orr, and to a lesser extent Lambert and Walton, primarily by bringing them within the Delius orbit. In the case of the latter pair, Palmer argues, "those reminiscences of Delius which crop up from time to time in [their] music ... are more probably Delius filtered through Warlock".<ref>Palmer, p. 162</ref> 

As well as his contribution to the art of song, Heseltine's  biographer Brian Collins considers him one of the  prime movers in the 20th century renaissance of early English music;<ref name= Collins>{{cite web|last= Collins|first= Brian|title= Peter Warlock's Music|url= http://www.peterwarlock.org/Collinspwmusic.htm|publisher= The Peter Warlock Society|year= 2001|accessdate= 27 September 2012}}</ref> apart from much writing on the subject, he made well over 500 transcriptions of early works.  He also wrote or contributed to ten books, in addition to his output of general music articles and reviews.<ref name= GMO/> Many years later, Gray wrote of Heseltine: "In the memory of his friends, he is as alive now as he ever was when he trod the earth, and so he will continue to be until the last of us are dead".<ref>Gray 1985, p. 261</ref> During his Eynsford years, Heseltine had provided his own  epitaph:
:::::::::::::::"Here lies  Warlock the composer
::::::::::::::::Who lived next door to Munn the grocer.
:::::::::::::::He died of drink and copulation,
::::::::::::::::A sad discredit to the nation."<ref>Smith 1994, p. 224</ref>

===Influences===
In the early 20th century  the German-influenced 19th century song-writing traditions generally followed by  [[Hubert Parry|Parry]], [[Charles Villiers Stanford|Stanford]], Elgar and the youthful [[Roger Quilter]], were in a process of eclipse. For composers such as [[Ralph Vaughan Williams|Vaughan Williams]] and [[George Butterworth]], English folk-song became a dominant feature of their work;<ref name= C49>Copley 1979, pp. 49<U+2013>50</ref>  at the same time, song-writers were seeking to extend their art by moving beyond the piano to develop  richer forms of vocal accompaniment.<ref>{{cite journal|last= Copley|first= I.A.|title= Peter Warlock's Vocal Chamber Music|url= http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/731397?uid=3738032&uid=2&uid=4&sid=21101259588747|journal= Music & Letters|volume= 44|issue= 4|date= October 1963}} {{subscription}}</ref>  Thus, as Copley observes, at the outset of his career as a composer Heseltine  found in song-writing a dynamic ambience, "within which he could express himself, or against which he could react".<ref name= C49/>

By the time  Heseltine began composing seriously, around 1915<U+2013>16, he had started to shake off the overwhelming influence of Delius. He had discovered English folk-song in 1913, his Oxford year, and had begun to study  Elizabethan and Jacobean  music.<ref>Copley 1979, p. 34</ref>  In 1916 he encountered and came under the spell of van Dieren, whose influence soon exceeded that of Delius and led to a significant development in compositional technique, first evident in the ''Saudades'' song cycle of 1916<U+2013>17.<ref name= Bradbury>{{cite book

<blockquote>They [the differing elements] are fused together in a curiously personal way: the separate ingredients can be analysed and defined, but not the ultimate product, which is not Dowland ''plus'' van Dieren or Elizabethan ''plus'' modern, but simply something wholly individual and unanalysable<U+2014>Peter Warlock. No one else could have written it.<ref>Gray 1934, p. 245</ref></blockquote>

Apart from those within his circle, Heseltine  drew inspiration from other composers whose work he respected: [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]], [[Gabriel Faur<U+00E9>|Faur<U+00E9>]] and [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]]. He had, however, a particular dislike for the works of his fellow song-writer [[Hugo Wolf]].<ref name= Cock1/> Heseltine's songs demonstrate   moods of both darkness and warm good humour, a dichotomy that helped to fuel the idea of a split Warlock/Heseltine personality. This theory  was rejected by the composer's friends and associates, who tended to see the division in terms of "Philip drunk or Philip sober".<ref name= ODNB/><ref name= GMO/>

===General character===
In a summary of the  Warlock oeuvre, Copley asserts that Heseltine was  a natural melodist in the Schubert mould: "With very few exceptions his melodies will stand on their own ... they can be sung by themselves with no accompaniment, as complete and satisfing as folk-songs".<ref>Copley 1979, p. 255</ref> Copley  identifies certain  characteristic motifs or "fingerprints", which recur throughout the works and which are used to depict differences of mood and atmosphere: anguish, resignation but also warmth, tenderness and amorous dalliance.<ref>Copley 1979, pp. 260<U+2013>63</ref> The music critic Ernest Bradbury comments that Heseltine's songs "serve both singer and poet, the one in their memorably tuneful vocal lines, the other in a scrupulous regard for correct accentuation free from any suggestion of pedantry".<ref name= Bradbury/>

In musical parlance Heseltine was a miniaturist, a category he was happy to accept in disregard of the sometimes derogatory implications of the label: "I have neither the impulse nor the ability to erect monuments before which a new generation will bow down".<ref name= Collins/><ref>Gray 1934, p. 24</ref> He was almost entirely self-taught,  avoiding through his lack of a formal [[Music school|conservatory]] training  the "teutonic shadow"<U+2014>the influence of the German masters.<ref>Copley 1979, p. 253</ref> To the charge that his technique was "amateurish",<ref>Copley 1979, pp. 263<U+2013>64</ref> he responded by arguing that a composer should express himself in his own terms, not by "string[ing] together a number of tags and clich<U+00E9>s culled from the work of others".<ref name= Cockshott1940/> His compositions were themselves part of a learning process;  ''The Curlew'' song cycle originated in 1915 with the setting of a Yeats poem,<ref>Smith 1994, p. 105</ref> but did not reach completion until 1922.  Brian Collins characterises this work as  "a chronicle of [the composer's] progress and development".<ref name= Collins/>

===Critical appraisal===
Heseltine's music was generally well received by public and critics. The first Warlock compositions to attract critical attention  were three of the Dublin songs published by Rogers in 1918. William Child in ''The Musical Times'' thought these "first rate", and singled out "If Ever I Saw" as having particular distinction.<ref>''The Musical Times '' review, November 1919, quoted in Copley 1979, p. 66</ref> In 1922, in the same magazine, the short song cycle ''Mr Belloc's Fancy'' was likewise praised, especially "Warlock's rattling good tunes and appropriately full-blooded accompaniment".<ref>''The Musical Times '' review, September 1922, quoted in Copley 1979, p. 83</ref> Vaughan Williams was delighted with the reception accorded the ''Three Carols'', when he conducted the [[The Bach Choir|Bach Choir]] at the Queen's Hall in December 1923.<ref>Smith 1994, p. 214</ref> Early in 1925 the [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] broadcast a performance of the Serenade for string orchestra witten to honour Delius, a sign, says Smith, that the music establishment was beginning to take Warlock seriously.<ref>Smith 1994, p. 228</ref> Heseltine himself noted the warmth of the Prom audience's reaction to his conducting of the ''Capriol Suite'' in 1919: "I was recalled four times".<ref name= S263>Smith 1994, p. 263</ref>

After Heseltine's tragic death,  assessment of his musical stature were generous. On the loss to English music,  Newman considered  some of Heseltine's choral compositions "among the finest music written for massed voices by a modern Englishman."<ref name= Cop1/> Constant Lambert hailed him as "one of the greatest song-writers that music has ever known",<ref>Smith 1994, p. 289</ref> a view echoed by Copley.<ref>Copley 1979, p. 265</ref> In a tribute published in ''The Musical Times'', van Dieren referred to  Heseltine's music as  "a national treasure" that would long survive all  that was currently being said or written about it.<ref>{{cite journal|authorlink= Bernard van Dieren|last= van Dieren|first= Bernard|title= Philip Heseltine|journal= The Musical Times|volume= 72|issue= 1056|date= February 1931|pages= pp. 117<U+2013>19}}</ref> In subsequent years his standing as a composer diminished; Brian Collins records how public perceptions of Warlock  were distorted by the scandalous reports of his private life, so that his musical importance  in the inter-war years became obscured.<ref name= Collins/> However, the foundation of the Peter Warlock Society in 1963 created a renewal of interest in the music.<ref name= Bradbury/> Collins acknowledges that the Warlock output includes much that can be dismissed as mere programme-fillers and encore items, but these do not detract from numerous works of the highest quality, "frequently thrilling and passionate and, occasionally, innovative to the point of being revolutionary".<ref name= Collins/>

==Written works==
