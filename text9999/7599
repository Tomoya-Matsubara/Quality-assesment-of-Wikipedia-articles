{{portal|Arizona}}
'''Tucson''' ({{pronEng|<U+02C8>tu<U+02D0>s<U+0252>n}}) is the seat of [[Pima County, Arizona]], [[United States]], located 118 miles (188 [[kilometer|km]]) southeast of [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] and 60 miles (98 km) north of the [[U.S.-Mexico border]].  As of [[July 1]] [[2006]], a [[Census Bureau]] estimate puts the city's population at 518,956,<ref name=popest/> with a [[metropolitan area]] population at 946,362. In 2005, Tucson ranked as the [[List of United States cities by population|32<sup>nd</sup> largest]] city and [[List of United States metropolitan areas|52<sup>nd</sup> largest]] metropolitan area in the [[United States|U.S.]] It is the largest city in southern [[Arizona]] and the second largest in the state. Tucson is also the site of the [[University of Arizona]].

Major incorporated suburbs of Tucson include [[Oro Valley]] and [[Marana, Arizona|Marana]] northwest of the city, [[South Tucson]] (surrounded by Tucson), and [[Sahuarita, Arizona|Sahuarita]] south of the city. Communities in the vicinity of Tucson (some within or overlapping the city limits) include [[Casas Adobes, Arizona|Casas Adobes]], [[Catalina, Arizona|Catalina]], [[Catalina Foothills, Arizona|Catalina Foothills]], [[Flowing Wells, Arizona|Flowing Wells]], [[Green Valley, Arizona|Green Valley]], [[Tanque Verde, Arizona|Tanque Verde]], [[New Pascua]], and [[Vail, Arizona|Vail]].

The English name ''Tucson'' originates from the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] name of the city, ''Tucs<U+00F3>n'' {{IPA|[tuk'son]}}, which is itself borrowed from the [[O'odham language|O'odham]] name for the city, {{Unicode|''Cuk <U+1E62>on''}} (pronounced {{IPA|[<U+02A7><U+028A>k <U+0282><U+0254>n]}}; roughly, "chuk shon"), meaning "at the base of the black [hill]" a reference to an adjacent volcanic mountain. This mountain is formally named [[Sentinel Peak (Arizona)|Sentinel Peak]], better known as "A Mountain" because it sports a large letter ''A'' in honor of the University of Arizona.<ref name="Amtn">"[http://www.fodors.com/miniguides/mgresults.cfm?destination=tucson@159&cur_section=sig&property_id=101526 'A' Mountain (Sentinel Peak)]." ''[[Fodor's]].'' Retrieved on [[February 23]], [[2007]].</ref> Tucson is sometimes referred to as "The Old Pueblo."

==History==
[[Image:Tucson Stone Ave year 1880.jpg|thumb|left|<center>Stone Avenue in Tucson, 1880</center>]]
Tucson was probably first visited by [[Paleo-Indians]], known to have been in southern Arizona by about 12,000 years ago. Recent archaeological excavations near the [[Santa Cruz River]] have located a village site dating from 4,000 years ago. The floodplain of the Santa Cruz River was extensively farmed during the Early Agricultural period, circa 1200 BC to AD 150. These people constructed irrigation canals and grew corn, beans, and other crops while gathering wild plants and hunting animals. The Early Ceramic period occupation of Tucson saw the first extensive use of pottery vessels for cooking and storage. The groups designated by archaeologists as the [[Hohokam]] lived in the area from AD 600-1450 and are known for their red-on-brown pottery.

[[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] missionary [[Eusebio Francisco Kino]] visited the Santa Cruz River valley in 1692, and founded the [[Mission San Xavier del Bac]] about 7 miles (12 km) upstream from the site of the settlement of Tucson in 1700. The Spanish established a presidio (fort) on [[August 20]] [[1775]] and the town came to be called "Tucson." Tucson became a part of [[Mexico]] after Mexico gained independence from [[Spain]] in 1821. Following the [[Gadsden purchase]] in 1853, Tucson became a part of the [[United States of America]], although the American military did not formally take over control of the community until March 1856. From August 1861, until mid-1862, Tucson was the capital of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] [[Arizona Territory (CSA)|Arizona Territory]]. Until 1863, Tucson and all of Arizona was part of [[New Mexico Territory]]. From 1867 to 1879, Tucson was the capital of  [[Arizona Territory]]. The [[University of Arizona]], located in Tucson, was founded in 1885.

By 1900, 7,531 people lived in the city. At about this time, the US [[Veterans Administration]] had begun construction on the present Veterans Hospital. Many veterans who had been [[chemical weapons|gassed]] in [[World War I]] and were in need of [[respiratory therapy]] began coming to Tucson at this time, due to the clean dry air. The population increased gradually to 13,913 in 1910, 20,292 in 1920, and 36,818 in 1940. In 2006 the population of [[Pima County, Arizona|Pima County]], in which Tucson is located, passed one million while the City of Tucson's population was 535,000.

During the territorial and early statehood periods, Tucson was Arizona's largest city and commercial area, whereas Phoenix was the seat of state government and agriculture. The establishment of Tucson Municipal Airport increased its prominence. By the 1920s-30s, Phoenix outgrew Tucson and has continued to expand. Tucson has still been growing but at a slower pace.

==Geography and climate==
===Geography===
[[Image:TucsonAZ ISS009-E-10382.jpg|thumb|<center>Tucson as seen from space</center>]]
Tucson is located at {{coor dms|32|12|52|N|110|55|5|W|region:US}} (32.214476, -110.918192).{{GR|1}}

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of 195.1&nbsp;[[square mile]]s (505.3&nbsp;[[km<U+00B2>]]), of which, 194.7&nbsp;square miles (504.2&nbsp;km<U+00B2>) of it is land and 0.4&nbsp;square miles (1.1&nbsp;km<U+00B2>) of it (0.22%) is water.

The city's elevation is 2,389 ft (728 m) above sea level. Tucson is situated on an [[alluvial plain]] in the [[Sonoran desert]], surrounded by five minor ranges of mountains: the [[Santa Catalina Mountains]] and the [[Tortolita Mountains]] to the north, the [[Santa Rita Mountains]] to the south, the [[Rincon Mountains]] to the east, and the [[Tucson Mountains]] to the west. The high point of the Santa Catalina Mountains is 9,157-foot [[Mount Lemmon]], the southernmost ski destination in the continental U.S., while the Tucson Mountains include 4,687-foot Wasson Peak. [[Image:windy600.jpg|thumb|left|<center>The view of Tucson from Windy Point, at elevation 6,580 feet on [[Mount Lemmon|Mt. Lemmon]]</center>]]

The city is located on the [[Santa Cruz River]], a dry river bed much of the year that floods during significant seasonal rains. (The Santa Cruz becomes a subterranean stream part of the year although it may appear dry.)

Tucson is located along [[Interstate 10]], which runs through [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] toward [[Santa Monica, California]] in the northwest, and through [[El Paso, Texas]], and [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], toward [[Jacksonville, Florida]] in the east. [[Interstate 19|I-19]], runs south from Tucson toward [[Nogales, Arizona|Nogales]] and the [[U.S.-Mexico border]]. I-19 is the only Interstate highway that uses "[[kilometer]] posts" instead of "[[milepost]]s", although the speed limits are marked in miles per hour instead of kilometers per hour.

====Environmental sustainability====
Tucson is considered to be in a natural location for the development of a solar energy community, but the city has not yet undertaken this as a serious project. Perhaps the biggest sustainability problem is potable water supply. Household water use is the principal drain on the water supply, with agriculture a close second. In 1997, the 35 golf courses in the area consumed about 10% of the municipal water supply, and since then, 16 of the remaining 25 or so courses use reclaimed water.
[[Image:Tucson_golf_reclaimed_water.jpg|thumb|right|<center>Tucson golf course which uses reclaimed water</center>]]
As a result, residences consume the vast majority of municipal water. Like golf courses, agricultural lands are turning toward reclaimed water. Mining and other industrial water uses combined accounted for about a 15% of water use in 1997 <ref>[http://ag.arizona.edu/AZWATER/publications/sustainability/report_html/chap5_01.html University of Arizona water sustainability report]</ref>. Although Tucsonans find lawns and swimming pools less acceptable than their neighbors in Phoenix{{Fact|date=May 2007}}, massive drawing down of groundwater resources over the last 100 years has occurred, visible as ground [[subsidence]] in some residential areas.

Tucson's reliance on the [[Central Arizona Project Aqueduct]], which passes more than 300 miles (480 km) across the desert from the [[Colorado River]], casts doubt over "sustainability" claims even at current population levels. This points to the need for further efforts at re-use and recycling, prompted by Pima County and the city in numerous outreach campaigns, and halt to urban growth into the fragile ecosystems of the surrounding Sonoran Desert.

====Water====
[[Image:Tucson_Santa_Cruz_River_Flood.jpg|thumb|left|<center>Santa Cruz River with water in it</center>]]More than 100 years ago, the Santa Cruz River flowed nearly year-round through Tucson. This supply of water has slowly disappeared, causing Tucson to seek alternative sources.

From 1803 until 1887, Tucson residents purchased water for a penny a gallon from vendors who transported it in bags draped over burros' backs. After that, water was sold by the bucket or barrel and delivered door-to-door in wagons.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

In 1881, water was pumped from a well on the banks of the Santa Cruz River and flowed by gravity through pipes into the distribution system.

Tucson currently draws water from two main sources: [[Central Arizona Project]] (CAP) water and [[groundwater]]. In 1992, Tucson Water delivered CAP water to some customers that was referred to as being unacceptable due to discoloration, bad odor and flavor, as well as problems it caused some customers' plumbing and appliances. Tucson's city water currently consists of CAP water mixed with groundwater.

In an effort to conserve water, Tucson is recharging groundwater supplies by running part of its share of CAP water into various open portions of local rivers to seep into their aquifer[http://www.ci.tucson.az.us/water/heritage.htm]. Additional study is scheduled to determine the amount of water that is lost through evaporation from the open areas, especially during the summer.

====Cityscape====
[[Image:TucsonMap.png|thumb|right|<center>Tucson Map</center>]]
Similar to many other [[Western U.S.]] cities, Tucson was developed on a [[grid plan]], with the city center at Stone Avenue and Broadway Boulevard. While this intersection was initially near the [[geographic center]] of Tucson, that center has shifted as the city has expanded far to the east. An expansive city covering substantial area, Tucson has many distinct neighborhoods.

====Earliest neighborhoods====
[[Image:Tucson_Armory_Park.jpg|thumb|left|<center>Armory Park Neighborhood</center>]]Tucson's early neighborhoods (some of which are covered by the [[Tucson Convention Center]]) include El Presidio; Barrio Hist<U+00F3>rico; Armory Park,directly south of downtown; Barrio Anita, named for an early settler; Barrio Tibur<U+00F3>n (in the present Fourth Avenue arts district), designated in territorial times as a "red light" district; El Jard<U+00ED>n, named for an early recreational site, Levin's Gardens; and El Hoyo, named for a lake that was part of the gardens. Up until the building of the Tucson Convention Center (or TCC), El Hoyo (Spanish for pit or hole) referred to this part of the city, which was inhabited mainly by Mexican-American citizens and immigrants from Mexico. Other historical neighborhoods include the University neighborhood west of the University of Arizona, Iron Horse and Pie Allen neighborhoods just east of downtown, Sam Hughes neighborhood (named after an instigator-hero of the [[Camp Grant Massacre]]), located east of the University of Arizona, and Menlo Park, situated adjacent to [[Sentinel Peak (Arizona)|Sentinel Peak]].

====Downtown====
Downtown Tucson is undergoing a revitalization effort by city planners and the business community. The primary project is Rio Nuevo, a large retail and community center that has been in planning for more than ten years. Downtown is generally classified as north of 12th Street, east of [[Interstate 10 in Arizona|I-10]], and southwest of Toole Avenue and the Union Pacific (formerly Southern Pacific) railroad tracks, site of the [http://www.tucsonhistoricdepot.org/1673/timeline/index.htm historic train depot] and "Locomotive #1673", built in 1900.  Downtown is divided into the Presidio District, Convention District, and the Congress Street Arts and Entertainment District.

[[Image:Tucson_Unisource_Energy_Building.jpg|thumb|<center>[[UniSource Energy Tower]] which is currently the tallest building in Tucson</center>]][[Image:Pima County Courthouse.jpg|thumb|left|<center>Pima County Courthouse</center>]]Tucson's tallest building, the 23-story [[UniSource Energy Tower]] (also called the Bank Building) is situated downtown and was completed in 1986. The proposed Century Tower for downtown would surpass the Bank Building at 27 stories. Other high-rise buildings downtown include [[Bank of America|Bank of America Plaza]], and the Pioneer (completed in 1914).

Attractions downtown include the historic Hotel Congress designed in 1919, the [[Art Deco]] [[Fox Theatre (Tucson)|Fox Theatre]] designed in 1929, the [[Rialto Theatre (Arizona)|Rialto Theatre]] opened in 1920, and [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine Cathedral]] completed in 1896.<ref>http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/ci/?id=102386</ref> Included on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] is the old Pima County Courthouse, designed by Roy W. Place in 1928.<ref>http://www.azhistorytraveler.org/templates/content-view.php?nid=2&sid=546</ref>

====Central or Midtown====
As one of the oldest parts of town, Central Tucson is anchored by the Broadway Village shopping center designed by local architect Josias Joesler at the intersection of Broadway Boulevard and Country Club Road.  The [[University of Arizona]], chartered in 1885, is located in midtown and includes [[Arizona Stadium]] and [[McKale Center]]. Historic Tucson High School (designed in 1924), and the Arizona Inn (built in 1930) are also located in Central Tucson.

[[Image:Tucson_Central_Office_building.jpg|thumb|left|<center>An office Building in Tucson Located at Broadway Blvd. and Craycroft Rd.</center>]]
Tucson's largest park, Reid Park is located in midtown and includes [[Reid Park Zoo]] and [[Hi Corbett Field]].  Local retail business in Central Tucson is concentrated along Fourth Avenue and the Main Gate Square on University Boulevard near the UA campus. The [[El Con Mall]] is also located in midtown.

Speedway Boulevard, a major east-west arterial road in central Tucson, was named the "ugliest street in America" by ''[[Life Magazine]]'' in the early 1970s, quoting Tucson Mayor [[Jim Corbett (politician)|James Corbett]]. Despite this, Speedway Boulevard was awarded "Street of the Year" by ''[[Arizona Highways]]'' in the late 1990s.

====South side and South Tucson====
[[Image:TUS_Terminal_Front.jpg|thumb|right|<center>[[Tucson International Airport]] when it was under renovation</center>]]
The Southside contains the city of [[South Tucson, Arizona|South Tucson]], with an area of approximately 1<U+00BC> square miles (3<U+00BC> square kilometers), which is completely surrounded by the city of Tucson. The South side is generally considered to be the area of approximately 25 square miles (65 square kilometers) north of Los Reales Road, south of 22nd Street, east of [[I-19]], west of Davis Monthan Air Force Base and southwest of Aviation Parkway. Much of Tucson's Mexican-American population live on the south side and South 12th Avenue is considered as the cultural locus of the working class Mexican-American population. The [[Tucson International Airport]] and [[Tucson Electric Park]] are also located here.

====West Tucson====
West Tucson is a combination of [[urban area|urban]] and [[suburban]] development.  Generally defined as the area west of [[Interstate 10 in Arizona|I-10]], West Tucson encompasses the banks of the [[Santa Cruz River]] and the foothills of the [[Tucson Mountains]].  Attractions in West Tucson include [[Saguaro National Park|Saguaro National Park West]], [[Sentinel Peak (Arizona)|Sentinel Peak]], the [[Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum]], [[Old Tucson Studios]], and the [[JW Marriott Hotels|Marriott Starr Pass Resort & Spa]].

[[Image:MountainLion.jpg|thumb|left|<center>A Mountain Lion at the [[Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum]]</center>]]
On Sentinel Peak, just west of downtown, there is a giant "A" in honor of the [[University of Arizona]]. Starting in about 1910, a yearly tradition developed for freshmen to whitewash the "A", which was visible for miles. However, at the beginning of the [[Iraq War]], anti-war activists painted it black. This was followed by a paint scuffle where the "A" was painted various colors until the city council intervened. It is now red, white and blue except when it is white or another color decided by a biennial election. Because of the three-color paint scheme often used, the shape of the A can be vague and indistinguishable from the rest of the peak. The top of Sentinel Peak, which is accessible by road, offers an outstanding scenic view of the city looking eastward. A parking lot located near the summit of Sentinel Peak was formerly a popular place to watch sunsets, view the city lights at night, or engage in [[necking]]. This is no longer possible as a recent ordinance has forced the closing of Sentinel Peak at 8 p.m. Every evening, Tucson police set up a barricade blocking the entrance while they enforce the evacuation of all visitors off the mountain{{Fact|date=May 2007}}.

====North Tucson====
North Tucson includes the urban neighborhoods of Amphitheater and [[Flowing Wells, Arizona|Flowing Wells]]. Usually considered the area north of Fort Lowell Road, north Tucson includes some of Tucson's primary [[commerce|commercial]] zones ([[Tucson Mall]] and the Oracle Road Corridor). Many of the city's most upscale [[boutiques]], [[restaurants]], and [[art galleries]] are also located on the north side including St. Philip's Plaza. The Plaza is directly adjacent to the historic St. Philip's in the Hills Episcopal Church (built in 1936).

[[Image:La_Paloma_Tucson.jpg|thumb|<center>Tucson La Paloma Resort in North Tucson</center>]]
Also on the north side is the suburban community of [[Catalina Foothills, Arizona|Catalina Foothills]], located in the foothills of the [[Santa Catalina Mountains]] just north of the city limits. This community includes among the area's most expensive homes, commonly multi-million dollar estates. The Foothills area is generally defined as north of River Road, east of Oracle Road, and west of [[Sabino Canyon|Sabino Creek]]. Some of the Tucson area's major resorts are located in the Catalina Foothills, including the Hacienda Del Sol, [[Westin Hotels|Westin La Paloma Resort]], [[Loews Hotels|Loews Ventana Canyon Resort]] and [[Canyon Ranch|Canyon Ranch Resort]]. [[La Encantada (shopping mall)|La Encantada]], an upscale outdoor [[shopping mall]], is also in the Foothills.  Also located in the Foothills is the DeGrazia Gallery in Sun near the intersection of Swan Road and Skyline Drive.  Built by artist [[Ettore DeGrazia|Ted DeGrazia]] starting in 1951, the 10 acre property is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] and a free museum.

====East Tucson====
East Tucson is relatively new compared to other parts of the city, developed between the 1950s and the 1970s. It is generally classified as the area of the city east of Swan Road, with above-average real estate values relative to the rest of the city. The area includes urban and suburban development near the [[Rincon Mountains]]. East Tucson includes [[Saguaro National Park|Saguaro National Park East]]. Tucson's "Restaurant Row" is also located on the east side, along with a significant [[corporate]] and [[financial]] presence. Tucson's largest office building is 5151 East Broadway in east Tucson, completed in 1975. [[Park Place (Tucson, Arizona)|Park Place]], a recently renovated shopping center, is also located there.

Near the intersection of Craycroft and Ft. Lowell Road are the remnants of the Historic Fort Lowell.  This area has become one of Tucson<U+2019>s iconic neighborhoods.  The Fort abandoned at the end of the 1800s was rediscovered by a trio of artist in the 1930s.  The Bolsius family purchased and renovated surviving adobe buildings of the fort - transforming them into spectacular artistic southwestern architectural examples.  Their woodwork, plaster treatment and sense of proportion drawn on their Dutch heritage and New Mexican experience. Other artists and academics throughout the middle of the 20th century renovated, built and lived in the area.  This rural pocket in the middle of the city is listed on the National register of Historic Places.  Each year in February the neighborhood celebrates its history in the City Landmark it owns and restored the San Pedro Chapel.

[[Image:DMAFB_planes.jpg|thumb|left|<center>Davis Monthan AFB planes</center>]]
Situated between the [[Santa Catalina Mountains]] and the [[Rincon Mountains]] near [[Redington Pass]] northeast of the city limits is the community of [[Tanque Verde, Arizona|Tanque Verde]]. The Arizona National Golf Club, Forty-Niners Country Club, and the historic Tanque Verde Guest Ranch are also in northeast Tucson.

====Southeast Tucson====
Southeast Tucson continues to experience rapid residential development. The area includes the [[Davis-Monthan Air Force Base]]. The area is considered to be south of Golf Links Road. The suburban community of [[Vail, Arizona|Vail]] is also located on the southeast side.

====Northwest Tucson==== 
[[Image:Continental_Ranch.jpg|thumb|right|<center> The Northwest Side of Tucson is more recent and modern that other parts, as seen in this neighborhood</center>]]
The expansive area northwest of the city limits is diverse, ranging from the [[rural]] communities of [[Catalina, Arizona|Catalina]] and parts of the town of [[Marana, Arizona|Marana]], to the [[affluent]] town of [[Oro Valley, Arizona|Oro Valley]] in the western foothills of the [[Santa Catalina Mountains]], and residential areas in the northeastern foothills of the [[Tucson Mountains]]. The community of [[Casas Adobes, Arizona|Casas Adobes]] is also on the Northwest Side, with the distinction of being Tucson's first suburb, established in the late 1940s.  Casas Adobes is centered around the historic Casas Adobes Plaza (built in 1948). The [[Foothills Mall]] is also located on the northwest side.

Many of the Tucson area's golf courses and resorts are located in this area, including the [[Hilton Hotels|Hilton El Conquistador Golf & Tennis Resort]] in Oro Valley, the [[Omni Hotels|Omni Tucson National Resort & Spa]], and Westward Look Resort. [[Catalina State Park]] and [[Tortolita Mountains|Tortolita Mountain Park]] are also here.

===Climate===
[[Image:Wasson.jpg|thumb|left|<center>Snow on Wasson Peak</center>]] 
Tucson has two major seasons, summer and winter; plus three minor seasons: fall, spring, and the [[monsoon]].

[[Summer]] is characterized by low humidity, clear skies, and daytime high temperatures that exceed 100 degrees [[Fahrenheit]]. The average overnight temperature ranges between 68 <U+00B0>F (20 <U+00B0>C) and 85 <U+00B0>F (29 <U+00B0>C).

[[Image:Tucsonmonsoon.jpg|thumb|<center>Monsoon clouds blanket the Catalina Mountains, August 2005</center>]]The [[monsoon]]  can begin any time from mid-June to late July, with an average start date around [[July 3]]. It typically continues through August and sometimes into September.<ref name="NWS monsoon">[http://www.wrh.noaa.gov/twc/monsoon/monsoon.php NWS Tucson Office Monsoon tracker]</ref> During the monsoon, the [[relative humidity|humidity]] is much higher than the rest of the year. It begins with clouds building up from the south in the early afternoon followed by intense thunderstorms and rainfall, which can cause [[flash floods]]. Large areas of the city do not have [[storm sewer]]s, so monsoon rains flood the main thoroughfares, usually for no longer than a few hours. A few underpasses in Tucson have "feet of water" scales painted on their supports to discourage fording by automobiles during a rainstorm.<ref>Two underpasses leading towards downtown Tucson from the north, at Sixth Avenue and Stone Avenue, have such "feet of water" scales.</ref> The evening sky at this time of year is often pierced with dramatic lightning strikes.

==Economy==
Much of Tucson's economic development has been centered around the development of the [[University of Arizona]], which is currently the second largest employer in the city. [[Davis-Monthan Air Force Base]], located on the southeastern edge of the city, also provides many jobs for Tucson residents. Its presence, as well as the presence of a US Army Intelligence Center (Fort Huachuca, the largest employer in the region in nearby Sierra Vista), has led to the development of a significant number of high-tech industries, including government contractors, in the area. Today, there are more than 1,200 businesses employing over 50,000 people in the high-tech industries of Southern Arizona.

The City of Tucson, Pima County, the State of Arizona and the private sector have all made commitments to create a growing, healthy economy with high-tech industries as its foundation. Advanced technology companies like [[Raytheon]] Missile Systems, [[Texas Instruments]], [[IBM]], [[Intuit, Inc.]], Universal Avionics, Misys Healthcare Systems, [[Sanofi-Aventis]], Ventana Medical Systems, Inc., and [[Bombardier]] all have a significant presence in Tucson. Roughly 150 Tucson companies are in the optics industry, earning Tucson the nickname "Optics Valley".[http://www.azstarnet.com/neweconomy/optics.html]

Tourism is another major industry in Tucson, which has many resorts, hotels, and attractions. A significant economic force is middle-class and upper-class [[Sonora]]ns, who travel from [[Mexico]] to Tucson to purchase goods that are not readily available in their country.  In addition to vacationers, a significant number of winter residents, or "[[Snowbird (people)|snowbirds]]", are attracted by Tucson's mild winters and contribute to the local economy. Snowbirds often purchase [[second home]]s in Tucson and nearby areas, contributing significantly to the property tax base.  Other snowbirds and "[[perpetual traveler]]s" can be seen in large numbers arriving in autumn in large [[Recreational vehicle|RVs]] towing small cars.

==Arts and culture==
===Annual cultural events and fairs===
====Tucson Gem and Mineral Show====
The [[Tucson Gem & Mineral Show]] is held every year in February for two weeks. It is one of the largest [[Gemstone|gem]] and [[mineral]] shows in the world, and features many of the finest mineral specimens. There is no single location for display of minerals, but rather dozens of locations spread across town. The show has an estimated attendance of more than 50,000 people from over twenty countries. Attendees frequently include the general public, experts, beginning collectors, museum employees, dealers, retailers, and researchers. Many museums and universities, including the [[Smithsonian Institution]] and the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]], have displayed materials at the show.

====Tucson Folk Festival====
For the past 21 years the Tucson Folk Festival has taken place the first Saturday and Sunday of May in downtown Tucson. In addition to nationally known headline acts each evening, the Festival highlights over 100 local and regional musicians on four stages in one of the largest free festivals in the country. Organized by the Tucson Kitchen Musicians Association, volunteers make this festival possible. Arizona's only community radio station [[KXCI]] 91.3-FM, is a major partner, broadcasting from the Plaza Stage throughout the weekend. In addition, there are numerous workshops, events for children, sing-alongs, and a popular singer/songwriter contest. Musicians typically play 30-minute sets, supported by professional audio staff. A variety of food and crafts are available at the festival, as well as local micro-brews.  All proceeds from sales go to fund future festivals.

====Fourth Avenue Street Fair====
There are also two Fourth Avenue Street Fairs, in December and March, staged between 9th Street and University Boulevard, that feature arts and crafts booths, food vendors and street performers. The fairs began in 1970 when Fourth Avenue, which at the time had half a dozen thrift shops, several New Age bookshops and the Food Conspiracy Co-Op, was a gathering place for hippies, and a few merchants put tables in front of their stores to attract customers before the holidays.
These days the street fair has grown into a large corporate event, with most tables owned by outside merchants. It hosts mostly traveling craftsmen selling various arts such as pottery, paintings, wood working, metal decorations, candles, and many others.

====The Tucson Rodeo (Fiesta de los Vaqueros)====
[[Image:TeamRopingTucson.jpg|thumb|right|<center>Team Roping competition at<br>Tucson's ''Fiesta de los Vaqueros''</center>]]
Another popular event held in February, which is early spring in Tucson, is the Fiesta de los Vaqueros,or [[rodeo]] week. While at its heart the Fiesta is a sporting event, it includes what is billed as the world's largest non-mechanized parade{{Fact|date=May 2007}}. The Rodeo Parade is a popular event as most schools give two rodeo days off instead of Presidents Day.  The exception to this is Presidio High, which doesn't get either. Western wear is seen throughout the city as corporate dress codes are cast aside during the Fiesta. The Fiesta de los Vaqueros marks the beginning of the rodeo season in the United States. Fiesta de los Vaqueros, the premier event of the rodeo year, is held at the beginning of the rodeo season.  Go to websites tucsonrodeo.com  tucsonrodeoparade.com

====Tucson Meet Yourself====
Every October for the past 30 years, [http://www.tucsonmeetyourself.org/ Tucson Meet Yourself] has presented the faces of Tucson's many ethnic groups. For one weekend, dancing, singing, artwork, and food from more than 30 different ethnicities are featured in the downtown area. All performers are from Tucson and the surrounding area, in keeping with the idea of "meeting yourself."

====All Souls Procession Weekend====
One of the largest festivals celebrated is the All Souls Procession (www.AllSoulsProcession.org), held since 1990 on the first Sunday in November. Modeled on the Mexican holiday [[Day of the Dead|Dia de los Muertos]] (Day of the Dead), it combines elements of African, Anglo, Celtic, and Latin American culture. At sundown, thousands of people garbed in myriad costumes, mostly of the deceased, gather near the corner of Fourth Avenue and University Boulevard: Epic Cafe.  In 2005, the Tucson Police Department estimated that 7,500 people participated in this event.  The non-profit festal culture organization Many Mouths One Stomach (www.ManyMouths.org) organizes this event to acknowledge, mourn and celebrate deceased loved ones, and the "grand mystery" of death. Starting in 2006, the All Souls Procession became a 4-day long series of events. On Thursday evening the Fine Art Photography Exhibition opens, as well as the Evolving Community Altar.  Friday evening is the MMOS Fundraiser ''Dance of the Dead''. Saturday afternoon and evening is the Procession of Little Angels, and the Personal Altars Vigil. Sunday evening is the All Souls Procession, which snakes through the historic Fourth Avenue and downtown areas, and leads to the culmination of the entire festival: The Grand Finale.

==Media==
There are two major daily [[newspaper]]s in Tucson; the ''[[Arizona Daily Star]]'' (morning), and the ''[[Tucson Citizen]]'' (afternoon). The ''Citizen'' is the oldest continuously published newspaper in [[Arizona]], established in [[1870]]. There are also several free, weekly newspapers, including the ''[[Explorer (newspaper)|Explorer]]'' and the ''[[Tucson Weekly]]'' (an alternative publication). The ''Downtown Tucsonan'', ''Tucson Lifestyle Magazine'', and the ''DesertLeaf'' are monthly publications covering arts, architecture, decor, fashion, entertainment, business, history, and other events. The ''[[Arizona Daily Wildcat]]'' is the [[University of Arizona]]'s [[student newspaper]].

The Tucson metro area is served by many local television stations and is the 70th largest [[media market|designated market area]] (DMA) in the U.S. with 433,310 homes (0.39% of the total U.S.).<ref name="nielsen">Holmes, Gary.

==Government==
Tucson follows the "weak mayor" model of the [[council-manager government|council-manager]] form of local government. The 6-member city council holds exclusive legislative authority, and shares executive authority with the mayor, who is elected by the voters independently of the council. An appointed city manager, meanwhile, is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the city.

Both the council members and the mayor serve 4-year terms, and none face term limits. Council members are nominated by their wards via a ward-level primary held in September. The top vote-earners from each party then compete at-large for their ward's seat on the November ballot. In other words, come [[election day]], the whole city votes on all the council races up for that year. Council elections are severed: Wards 1, 2, and 4 (as well as the mayor) are up for election in the same year (most recently 2007), while Wards 3, 5, and 6 share another year (most recently 2005).

Tucson is known for being a trailblazer in voluntary partial [[campaign finance|publicly-financed campaigns]]. Since 1985, both mayoral and council candidates have been eligible to receive matching public funds from the city. To become eligible, council candidates must receive 200 donations of $10 or more (300 for a mayoral candidate). Candidates must then agree to spending limits equal to $.33 for every registered Tucson voter, or $79,222 in 2005 (the corresponding figures for mayor are $.64 per registered voter, or $142,271 in 2003). In return, candidates receive matching funds from the city at a 1:1 ratio of public money to private donations. The only other limitation is that candidates may not exceed 75% of the limit by the date of the primary. Many cities, such as [[San Francisco]] and [[New York City]], have copied this system, albeit with more complex spending and matching formulas.

Robert E. Walkup (R) was elected to Mayor on [[November 2]] [[1999]], re-elected for a second term on [[November 4]] [[2003]] and again for a third term on [[November 6]] [[2007]].<ref>http://www.tucsonaz.gov/mayor.html</ref> He was preceded by: George Miller (D),  1991-1999; Tom Volgy (D), 1987-1991; Lew(is) Murphy (R), 1971-1987; and Jim Corbett (D), ?-1971.

Tucson is divided between the 7th and 8th congressional districts of Arizona. The city center is in the 7th District, represented by [[Raul Grijalva]], a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], since 2003, while the more affluent residential areas to the north and east are in the 8th District, represented by [[Gabrielle Giffords]], also a Democrat, since 2007.

== Local place names ==
* Speedway Boulevard was the northern city limit of Tucson in the late 1800s. It was so named because of horse and buggy "[[drag race]]s" that would take place Saturdays along its straight length of a half mile.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} Street numbering starts one block south of Speedway and increases southward at intervals of one-eighth, one-tenth, or one-twelfth of a mile, depending on the historic density of the areas. The highest street number is 48<sup>th</sup> Street. Avenue numbers begin one block west of Euclid Avenue (the edge of the old university quarter) and increase westward, ending before the Santa Cruz River. The highest avenue number is 17<sup>th</sup> Avenue. House and building numbering is based from a [[zero point]] at the junction of Stone Avenue and Broadway Street and is incremented by 100 every one-eighth, one-tenth, or one-twelfth of a mile, again depending on the historic density of the areas.
* Drexel Road, located on the south side of the city, is named after [[Francis Anthony Drexel]], the father of Saint [[Katharine Drexel]]. Drexel owned property along the road in the 1800s. Another Drexel-related site is the [[Benedictine Sisters Monastery]],<ref>http://www.azstarnet.com/metro/163614</ref> built on the east side of town (now the middle of town) in 1940 with funds donated by St. Katharine.
* Ina Road, a major east-west thoroughfare north of town, is named for UA physical education professor Ina Gittings. Although the street is pronounced "Eye-nah" she pronounced her name "Eee-nah."
* Rita Road, located on Tucson's southeast side, is popularly believed to have been named by [[Howard Hughes]] in honor of his then girlfriend [[Rita Hayworth]]. Hughes Aircraft was located there in the 1950s. It is also widely believed to be named for the [[Santa Rita Mountains]] located southeast of Tucson.  However Rita Road was named for its connection to the small community of Rita, which was the El Paso and Southwestern (EP&SW) railroad stop serving the Santa Rita ranch.  Rita was located just SE of Rankin, AZ  which was located less than quarter-mile northeast of the present-day intersection of Kolb and Valencia. Rita was nearly due west from Esmond, AZ.  Few traces of Rita survive, but Rankin and Esmond are easily located.  Trivia:  heading east from Tucson the railroad stops on the EP&SW were Aldona, Santa Cruz, Rita, and Vail.  On the Southern Pacific heading the same way you'd pass Polvo, Wilmot, Rankin, Esmond, and Vail.  The community of Rita was shown on local maps until at least 1922.
* Until the late 1960s, city bus route number 1 was called the Binghampton route. This route went from downtown, past the university, and to the community of Binghampton around the Ft. Lowell Road and Dodge Road intersection. Binghampton was a farming community that was absorbed into the city in the 1940s.
* Grant Road was originally two different roads, Grant Road and North Street. Because of map [[platt]]ing irregularies, the road starts eastward from Stone Avenue to First Avenue then veers south a block to the North Street alignment at Park Avenue, continues to Campbell Avenue, kicks north a block to the Grant Road alignment and continues eastward. The Grant Road alignment is exactly one mile north of the Speedway alignment, but the North Street alignment was preferred in the Park Avenue to Campbell section because the [[Section (United States land surveying)|section]] line was laid out differently for the subdivision directly south and following the Grant Road alignment would have necessitated demolishing many homes.
