'''''Tarbosaurus''''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|<U+02CC>|t|<U+0251>r|b|<U+0275>|<U+02C8>|s|<U+0254>r|<U+0259>|s}} {{respell|TAR|bo|SAWR|<U+0259>s}}; meaning "alarming lizard") is a [[genus]] of [[tyrannosaurid]] [[theropod dinosaur]] that flourished in [[Asia]] about 70 [[million years ago]], at the end of the Late [[Cretaceous]] [[Period (geology)|Period]]. [[Fossil]]s have been recovered in [[Mongolia]], with more fragmentary remains found further afield in parts of [[China]]. Although many [[species]] have been named, modern paleontologists recognize only one, ''T. bataar'', as valid. Some experts contend that this species is actually an Asian representative of the [[North America]]n genus ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]''; if true, this would invalidate the genus ''Tarbosaurus'' altogether.

''Tarbosaurus'' and ''Tyrannosaurus'' are considered to be at least closely related genera, if not [[synonym (taxonomy)|synonymous]]. ''[[Alioramus]]'', also from Mongolia, is thought by some authorities to be the closest relative of ''Tarbosaurus''. Like most known tyrannosaurids, ''Tarbosaurus'' was a large [[biped]]al [[predation|predator]], weighing more than a ton and equipped with dozens of large, sharp teeth. It had a unique locking mechanism in its lower jaw and the smallest forelimbs relative to body size of all tyrannosaurids, renowned for their disproportionately tiny, two-fingered forelimbs. 

''Tarbosaurus'' lived in a humid [[floodplain]] criss-crossed by river channels. In this environment, it was an [[apex predator]] at the top of the [[food chain]], probably preying on other large dinosaurs like the [[hadrosaur]] ''[[Saurolophus]]'' or the [[sauropod]] ''[[Nemegtosaurus]]''. ''Tarbosaurus'' is very well represented in the [[fossil]] record, known from dozens of specimens, including several complete skulls and skeletons. These remains have allowed scientific studies focusing on its [[phylogeny]], skull mechanics, and brain structure.

==Description==
[[File:Tarbosaurusscale.png|left|thumb|Adult (25 year old) and juvenile (2 year old) with a human for scale]]
Although smaller than ''Tyrannosaurus'', ''Tarbosaurus'' was one of the largest tyrannosaurids.

The largest known ''Tarbosaurus'' skull is more than 1.3&nbsp;meters (4&nbsp;ft) long, larger than all other tyrannosaurids except ''Tyrannosaurus''.<ref name=holtz2004/> The skull was tall, like that of ''Tyrannosaurus'', but not as wide, especially towards the rear. The unexpanded rear of the skull meant that ''Tarbosaurus'' eyes did not face directly forwards, suggesting that it lacked the [[binocular vision]] of ''Tyrannosaurus''. Large [[fenestra]]e (openings) in the skull reduced its weight. Between 60 and 64 teeth lined its jaws, slightly more than in ''Tyrannosaurus'' but fewer than in smaller tyrannosaurids like ''[[Gorgosaurus]]'' and ''Alioramus''. Most of its teeth were oval in [[Cross section (geometry)|cross section]], although the teeth of the [[premaxilla]] at the tip of the upper jaw had a ''D''-shaped cross section. This [[heterodonty]] is characteristic of the family. The longest teeth were in the [[maxilla]] (upper jaw bone), with [[tooth crown|crowns]] up to 85&nbsp;millimeters (3.3&nbsp;in) long. In the [[mandible|lower jaw]], a ridge on the outer surface of the [[angular]] bone articulated with the rear of the [[dentary]] bone, creating a locking mechanism unique to ''Tarbosaurus'' and ''Alioramus''. Other tyrannosaurids lacked this ridge and had more flexibility in the lower jaw.<ref name=hurumsabath2003>{{cite_journal |last=Hurum |first= J<U+00F8>rn H. |coauthors=and Sabath, Karol. |year=2003 |title=Giant theropod dinosaurs from Asia and North America: Skulls of ''Tarbosaurus bataar'' and ''Tyrannosaurus rex'' compared |journal=Acta Palaeontologica Polonica |volume=48 |issue=2 |pages=161<U+2013>190 |format=PDF|url=http://www.app.pan.pl/archive/published/app48/app48-161.pdf}}</ref> 
[[File:TarbosaurusDB.jpg|thumb|left|Illustration of ''Tarbosaurus'']]
Tyrannosaurids varied little in body form, and ''Tarbosaurus'' was no exception. The head was supported by an ''S''-shaped neck, while the rest of the [[vertebral column]], including the long tail, was held horizontally. ''Tarbosaurus'' had tiny forelimbs, proportionably to body size the smallest of all members of the family. The hands had two clawed digits each, with an additional unclawed third metacarpal found in some specimens, similar to closely related genera. Holtz has suggested that ''Tarbosaurus'' also has a theropod reduction of fingers IV-I "developed further" than in other tyrannosaurids,<ref name="Holtz_in_Carpenter2001">Carpenter K, Tanke D.H. & Skrepnick M.W. (2001), ''Mesozoic Vertebrate Life'' ([[Indiana University Press]], [[ISBN]] 0-253-33907-3), p. 71.</ref> as the second metacarpal in the ''Tarbosaurus'' specimens he studied is less than twice the length of the first metacarpal (other tyrannosaurids have a second metacarpal about twice the length of the first metacarpal). Also, the third metacarpal in ''Tarbosaurus'' is proportionally shorter than in other tyrannosaurids; in other tyrannosaurids (like ''[[Albertosaurus]]'' and ''[[Daspletosaurus]]''), the third metacarpal is often longer than the first metacarpal, while in the ''Tarbosaurus'' specimens studied by Holtz, the third metacarpal is shorter than the first.<ref name=holtz2004>{{Cite book|last=Holtz |first=Thomas R. |authorlink=Thomas R.

In contrast to the forelimbs, the three-toed hindlimbs were long and thick, supporting the body in a bipedal posture. The long, heavy tail served as a [[counterweight]] to the head and torso and placed the [[center of gravity]] over the hips.<ref name=maleev1955b/><ref name=holtz2004/>

==Discovery and naming==
[[File:Tarbosaurus skull.jpg|thumb|left|Holotype skull PIN 551-1, Museum of Paleontology, [[Moscow]]]] 
<!--The first tyrannosaurid fossils recorded from Central Asia consist of postcranial material from Inner Mongolia. These fossils were collected in 1920 by the Central Asiatic Expeditions of the American Museum of Natural History and described as ''[[Alectrosaurus|Alectrosaurus olseni]]'' by Charles Gilmore in 1933.<ref>Hurum, J.H. and Sabath, K. (2003). "Giant theropod dinosaurs from Asia and North America: Skulls of ''Tarbosaurus bataar'' and ''Tyrannosaurus rex'' compared." ''Acta Palaeontologica Polonica'' '''48''' (2): 161<U+2013>190.</ref>-->
In 1946, a joint [[USSR|Soviet]]-Mongolian expedition to the [[Gobi Desert]] in the Mongolian [[<U+00D6>mn<U+00F6>govi Province]] turned up a large theropod skull and some [[vertebra]]e in the [[Nemegt Formation]]. In 1955, [[Evgeny Maleev]], a Russian [[paleontologist]], made this specimen the [[holotype]] ([[Paleontological Institute of Russian Academy of Sciences|PIN]] 551-1) of a new species, which he called ''Tyrannosaurus bataar''.<ref name=maleev1955a/> The species name is a misspelling of the Mongolian <U+0431><U+0430><U+0430><U+0442><U+0430><U+0440>/''baatar'' ("hero").<ref name=hurumsabath2003/> In the same year, Maleev also described and named three new theropod skulls, each associated with skeletal remains discovered by the same expedition in 1948 and 1949. The first of these (PIN 551-2) was named ''Tarbosaurus efremovi'', a new generic name composed of the [[Ancient Greek]] ''<U+03C4><U+03B1><U+03C1><U+03B2><U+03BF><U+03C2>''/''tarbos'' ("terror", "alarm", "awe", or "reverence") and ''<U+03C3><U+03B1><U+03C5><U+03C1><U+03BF><U+03C2>''/''sauros'' ("lizard"),<ref name=liddellscott>{{cite book |last=Liddell |first=Henry G. |authorlink=Henry Liddell |coauthors=and [[Robert Scott (philologist)|Scott, Robert]] |year=1980 |title=Greek<U+2013>English Lexicon |edition=Abridged |publisher=Oxford University Press, |location=Oxford |isbn=0-19-910207-4}}</ref> and the species named after [[Ivan Yefremov]], a Russian paleontologist and [[science fiction]] author. The other two (PIN 553-1 and PIN 552-2) were also named as new species and assigned to the North American genus ''Gorgosaurus'' (''G. lancinator'' and ''G. novojilovi'', respectively). All three of these latter specimens are smaller than the first.<ref name=maleev1955b/>
[[File:TARBOSAURUS JUVENIL wiki.png|thumb|Fossils of a juvenile specimen]] 
A 1965 paper by [[Anatoly Konstantinovich Rozhdestvensky|A.K. Rozhdestvensky]] recognized all of Maleev's specimens as different [[ontogeny|growth stages]] of the same species, which he believed to be distinct from the North American ''Tyrannosaurus''.

==Paleobiology==

Like several other large tyrannosaurids, ''Tarbosaurus'' is known from relatively abundant and well-preserved fossil material. In fact, one quarter of all fossils collected from the Nemegt Formation belong to ''Tarbosaurus''.<ref name=jerzykiewiczrussell1991/> Although ''Tarbosaurus'' has not been studied as thoroughly as the North American tyrannosaurids,<ref name=hurumsabath2003/> the available material has allowed scientists to draw limited conclusions about its biology.

===Skull mechanics===
The skull of ''Tarbosaurus'' was completely described for the first time in 2003. Scientists noted key differences between ''Tarbosaurus'' and the North American tyrannosaurids. Many of these differences are related to the handling of stress by the skull bones during a bite. When the upper jaw bit down on an object, [[force]] was transmitted up through the maxilla, the primary tooth-bearing bone of the upper jaw, into surrounding skull bones. In North American tyrannosaurids, this force went from the maxilla into the fused [[nasal bone]]s on top of the snout, which were firmly connected in the rear to the [[lacrimal bone]]s by bony struts. These struts locked the two bones together, suggesting that force was then transmitted from the nasals to the lacrimals.<ref name=hurumsabath2003/>
[[File:Tarbosaurus skull front.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Skull seen from the front]]
''Tarbosaurus'' lacked these bony struts, and the connection between the nasals and lacrimals was weak. Instead, a backwards projection of the maxilla was massively developed in ''Tarbosaurus'' and fit inside a sheath formed from the lacrimal. This projection was a thin, bony plate in North American tyrannosaurids. The large backwards projection suggests that force was transmitted more directly from the maxilla to the lacrimal in ''Tarbosaurus''. The lacrimal was also more firmly anchored to the [[frontal bone|frontal]] and [[prefrontal bone]]s in ''Tarbosaurus''. The well-developed connections between the maxilla, lacrimal, frontal and prefrontal would have made its entire upper jaw more rigid.<ref name=hurumsabath2003/>

Another major difference between ''Tarbosaurus'' and its North American relatives was its more rigid mandible (lower jaw). While many theropods, including North American tyrannosaurids, had some degree of flexibility between the bones in the rear of the mandible and the dentary in the front, ''Tarbosaurus'' had a locking mechanism formed from a ridge on the surface of the angular, which articulated with a square process on the rear of the dentary.<ref name=hurumsabath2003/>

Some scientists have [[hypothesis|hypothesized]] that the more rigid skull of ''Tarbosaurus'' was an adaptation to hunting the massive [[titanosaurid]] [[sauropod]]s found in the Nemegt Formation, which did not exist in most of North America during the Late Cretaceous. The differences in skull mechanics also have an impact on tyrannosaurid phylogeny. ''Tarbosaurus''-like articulations between the skull bones are also seen in ''Alioramus'' from Mongolia, suggesting that it, and not ''Tyrannosaurus'', is the closest relative of ''Tarbosaurus''. Similarities between ''Tarbosaurus'' and ''Tyrannosaurus'' might therefore be related to their large size, independently developed through [[convergent evolution]].<ref name=hurumsabath2003/>

===Brain structure===
[[File:Tarbosaurus profile.jpg|thumb|Skull and neck of a mounted fossil]] 
A ''Tarbosaurus'' skull found in 1948 by Soviet and Mongolian scientists (PIN 553-1, originally called ''Gorgosaurus lancinator'') included the skull cavity that held the brain. Making a plaster [[Casting|cast]], called an ''[[endocranial cast|endocast]]'', of the inside of this cavity allowed Maleev to make preliminary observations about the shape of a ''Tarbosaurus'' brain.<ref name=maleev1965>{{cite_journal |last=Maleev |first=Evgeny A. |authorlink=Evgeny Maleev |year=1965 |title=On the brain of carnivorous dinosaurs |language=Russian |journal=Paleontological Journal |volume=2 |pages=141<U+2013>143}}</ref> A newer [[polyurethane]] rubber cast allowed a more detailed study of ''Tarbosaurus'' brain structure and function.<ref name=savelievalifanov2005>{{cite_journal |last=Saveliev |first=Sergei V. |coauthors=and Alifanov, Vladimir R. |year=2005 |title=A new study of the brain of the predatory dinosaur ''Tarbosaurus bataar'' (Theropoda, Tyrannosauridae) |journal=Paleontological Journal |volume=41 |issue=3 |pages=281<U+2013>289 |doi=10.1134/S0031030107030070}}</ref>

''Tyrannosaurus rex'' brain structure has also been analyzed,<ref name=brochu2000>{{cite_journal |last=Brochu |first=Christopher A. |year=2000 |title=A digitally-rendered endocast for ''Tyrannosaurus rex'' |journal=Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=1<U+2013>6 |url=http://www.bioone.org/perlserv/?request=get-toc&issn=0272-4634&volume=20&issue=1 |doi=10.1671/0272-4634(2000)020[0001:ADREFT]2.0.CO;2}}</ref> and ''Tarbosaurus'' was similar, differing only in the positions of some [[cranial nerve]] roots, including the [[trigeminal nerve|trigeminal]] and [[accessory nerve]]s. Tyrannosaurid brains were more similar to those of [[crocodilia]]ns and other [[reptile]]s than to [[bird]]s. The total brain volume for a 12&nbsp;meter (40&nbsp;ft) ''Tarbosaurus'' is estimated at only 184&nbsp;cubic&nbsp;centimeters (11.2&nbsp;cu&nbsp;in). The large size of the [[olfactory bulb]]s, as well as the [[terminal nerve|terminal]] and [[olfactory nerve]]s, suggest that ''Tarbosaurus'' had a keen [[sense of smell]], as was also the case with ''Tyrannosaurus''. The [[Olfactory bulb#Accessory olfactory bulb|vomeronasal bulb]] is large and differentiated from the olfactory bulb, indicating a well-developed [[Jacobsen's organ]], which was used to detect [[pheromone]]s. This may imply that ''Tarbosaurus'' had complex mating behavior. The [[auditory nerve]] was also large, suggesting good [[Hearing (sense)|hearing]], which may have been useful for auditory [[animal communication|communication]] and spatial awareness. The nerve had a well-developed [[Vestibular system|vestibular]] component as well, which implies a good sense of balance and coordination. In contrast, the nerves and brain structures associated with [[eyesight]] were smaller and undeveloped. The [[midbrain tectum]], responsible for visual processing in reptiles, was very small in ''Tarbosaurus'', as were the [[optic nerve]] and the [[oculomotor nerve]], which controls eye movement. Unlike ''Tyrannosaurus'', which had forward-facing eyes that provided some degree of binocular vision, ''Tarbosaurus'' had a narrower skull more typical of other tyrannosaurids in which the eyes faced primarily sideways. All of this suggests that ''Tarbosaurus'' relied more on its senses of smell and hearing than on its eyesight.<ref name=savelievalifanov2005/>

===Paleopathology===
[[File:TarbosaurusP1050352.jpg|thumb|left|Cast of a specimen in [[death pose]]]] 
In 2001, [[Bruce Rothschild]] and others published a study examining evidence for [[stress fractures]] and [[tendon avulsions]] in [[theropod]] dinosaurs and the implications for their behavior. Since stress fractures are caused by repeated trauma rather than singular events they are more likely to be caused by regular behavior than other types of injuries. None of the 18 ''Tarbosaurus'' foot bones examined in the study was found to have a stress fracture, but one of the 10 examined hand bones was found to have one. Stress fractures in the hands have special behavioral significance compared to those found in the feet since stress fractures there can be obtained while running or during migration. Hand injuries, by contrast, are more likely to be obtained while in contact with struggling prey. The presence of stress fractures and tendon avulsions in general provide evidence for a "very active" predation-based diet rather than obligate scavenging.<ref name="rothschild-dino">Rothschild, B., Tanke, D.

Nemegt sediments preserve large river channels and soil deposits that indicate a far more humid climate than those suggested by the underlying [[Barun Goyot Formation|Barun Goyot]] and [[Djadochta Formation]]s. However, [[Caliche (mineral)|caliche]] deposits indicate at least periodic droughts. Sediment was deposited in the channels and floodplains of large rivers.

Other theropods, like the gigantic ''[[Therizinosaurus]]'', may have been [[herbivore|herbivorous]], and [[ornithomimosaur]]s such as ''[[Anserimimus]]'', ''[[Gallimimus]]'', and ''[[Deinocheirus]]'' might have been omnivores that only took small prey and were therefore no competition for ''Tarbosaurus''. However, as in other large tyrannosaurids as well as modern [[Komodo dragon]]s, juveniles and subadult ''Tarbosaurus'' may have filled niches between the massive adults and these smaller theropods.<ref name=holtz2004/>
