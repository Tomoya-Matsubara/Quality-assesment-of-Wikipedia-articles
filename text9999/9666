{{History of war}}

An '''invasion''' is a [[military]] action consisting of [[armed forces]] of one [[geopolitics|geopolitical]] entity entering [[territory]] controlled by another such entity, generally with the objective of conquering territory or altering the established [[government]]. An invasion can be the cause of a [[war]], it can be used as a part of a larger strategy to end a war, or it can constitute an entire war in and of itself. 

The term connotes a [[military strategy|strategic]] endeavor of substantial magnitude; because the goals of an invasion are usually large-scale and long-term, large forces are needed to hold territory and protect the interests of the invading entity. Smaller and lighter [[Military tactics|tactical]] infiltrations are not generally considered invasions, being more often classified as [[Skirmisher|skirmishes]], [[sortie]]s, [[targeted killing]]s, [[assassination]]s or [[Reconnaissance#Reconnaissance in force|reconnaissance in force]]. By definition, an invasion is an attack from outside forces. As such, [[rebellion]]s, [[civil war]]s, [[coup d'<U+00E9>tat|coups d'etat]], and internal acts of [[democide]] or other acts of [[oppression]] are generally not considered invasions.  

[[Archaeology|Archaeological]] evidence indicates that invasions have been frequent since [[prehistory]]. In antiquity, before [[radio]] [[communication]]s and fast [[transportation]], the only way to ensure adequate reinforcements was to move armies as one massive force. This, by its very nature, led to the strategy of invasion. With invasion came the [[cultural diffusion|cultural exchanges]] in government, [[religion]], [[philosophy]], and [[technology]] that shaped the development of much of the [[ancient world]].<ref>{{cite book|title = The Punic Wars : Rome, Carthage, and the Struggle for the Mediterranean |author =Bagnall, Nigel|year = 1990|publisher = Thomas Dunne Books  | id = ISBN 0312342144}}</ref>

==Motives and justifications==
Invasions have normally been mounted for straightforward territorial gain and geopolitical advantage. Added to these motivations have often been the attractions of immediate [[looting]]. However, the reasons advanced as justifications of invasions have included restoration of territory lost in the past; [[religion|religious]] [[idealism]]; policies of [[national interest]]; pursuit of enemies; protection of [[military alliance|allies]]; [[colonialism|acquisition of colonies]]; [[pre-emptive strike|preemption of a real or perceived future attack]]; protection or acquisition of transportation routes or natural resources, including [[water supply|water]] and [[petroleum]] supplies; quelling destabilizing or unconscionable conflict within or between neighbors; and as [[vengeance|punishment]] for a perceived slight.

A relatively recent justification for invasion, which arose during the nineteenth century with [[power (international)|Great Powers]] assuming the right to arrange world politics, has been to change or restore the leadership or political regime of a nation or territory. Often in these cases, opposing powers cited the motive of "protection" of the invaded territory.<ref>{{cite web | author=Halsall, Paul| title=Modern History Sourcebook: The Truman Doctrine, 1947|  year=1997 | url= http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1947TRUMAN.html| accessdate=February 11 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> During the nineteenth century, invasions of this nature frequently manifested themselves under the banner of [[imperialism]]. Such invasions are likely to be perceived by one side as an act of usurpation and by the other as an act of [[freedom|liberation]].

A modern political trend, probably instigated by a desire to avoid charges of [[imperialism]], has been for the invader to [[Euphemism|euphemistically]] label an invasion as an "intervention" to achieve a goal that is stated in beneficial terms.<ref>{{cite web | author=Rajamoorthy, T.| title=Deceit and Duplicity: Some Reflections on Western Intervention in Iraq| year=2003 | url= http://www.globalpolicy.org/security/issues/iraq/history/2003/0303deceit.htm| accessdate=February 11 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

==Defenses==
[[Image:GreatWallNearBeijingWinter.jpg|left|thumb|280px|The [[Great Wall of China|Great Wall]] in [[winter]], near [[Beijing]].]]

Nation-states with potentially hostile neighbors will typically adopt [[Defense (military)|defensive measures]] to delay or forestall an invasion. In addition to utilizing geographical barriers such as [[river]]s, [[marsh]]es, or rugged [[terrain]], these measures have historically included fortifications. Such a defense can be intended to actively prevent invading forces from entering the country by means of an extended and well-defended barrier; [[Hadrian's Wall]]<ref>{{cite web | author=Ibeji, Mike| title=Norman Conquest: Key Events of the Conquest|  year=2001 | url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/war/normans/key_events_01.shtml| accessdate=February 11 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> and the [[Great Wall of China]]<ref>{{cite web | author=Shea, Marilyn| title=The Great Wall of China|  year=1996 | url= http://ce.eng.usf.edu/pharos/wonders/Forgotten/greatwall.html| accessdate=February 11 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> are famous examples. Such barriers have also included [[trench]] lines and, in more modern times, [[minefield]]s, [[Closed-circuit television|camera]]s, and [[motion detection|motion-sensitive]] [[sensor]]s.<ref>{{cite web | author=Defense Update| title= Accelerating the Kill Chain: Closing the Sensor-to-shooter Cycle| year=2006 | url= http://www.defense-update.com/features/du-1-06/urban-c4i-7.htm| accessdate=February 11 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> However, these barriers can require a large military force to provide the defense, as well as maintain the equipment and positions, which can impose a great [[economics|economic]] burden on the country. Some of those same techniques can also be turned against defenders, used to keep them from escape or resupply. During [[Operation Starvation]], allied forces used mines to keep the Japanese from receiving shipments of food. <ref>{{cite web | author=Mason, Gerald A.| title= Operation Starvation| year=2002 | url= http://www.stormingmedia.us/05/0560/A056024.html| accessdate=February 11 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

Alternately, the fortifications can be built up at a series of sites, such as [[castle]]s or [[fortification|forts]] placed near a border. These structures are designed to delay an invasion long enough for the defending nation to mobilize an army of size sufficient for defense or, in some cases, counter-invasion, such as for example, the [[Maginot Line]]. Forts can be positioned so that the garrisons can interdict the supply lines of the invaders. The theory behind these spaced forts is that the invader can not afford to bypass these defenses, and so must lay siege to the structures.<ref>{{cite book|title = Fortress France: The Maginot Line and French Defenses in World War II|author = Kaufmann, J.E. and Kaufmann, H.W.|year = 2005|publisher = Prager Security International | id = ISBN 0275983455}}</ref>

In modern times, the notion of constructing large-scale static defenses to combat land based threats is quickly becoming obsolete. The use of precision air campaigns and large-scale mechanization have made lighter, more mobile defenses desirable to military planners. Nations defending against modern invasions normally use large population centers such as [[city|cities]] or [[town]]s as defensive points. The invader must capture these points to destroy the defender's ability to wage war. The defender uses mobile armored and infantry divisions to protect these points, but the defenders are still very mobile and can normally retreat. A prominent example of the use of cities as fortifications can be seen in the [[Military of Iraq|Iraqi Army's]] stands in the [[2003 Invasion of Iraq]] at [[Baghdad]], [[Tikrit]] and [[Basra]] in the major combat in the [[Second Gulf War]]. A defender can also use these mobile assets to precipitate a counteroffensive like the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Red Army]] at the [[Battle of Kursk]] and the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] or the [[Northern Alliance]] in [[Afghanistan]]. 

However, static emplacements remain useful in both defense against naval attacks and [[Anti-aircraft warfare|defense against air attacks]]. [[Naval mine]]s are still an inexpensive but effective way to defend [[port]]s and choke off [[supply line]]s. Large static air defense systems that combine antiaircraft guns with missile launchers are still the best way to defend against air attacks. Such systems were used effectively by the [[North Vietnam]]ese around [[Hanoi]]. Also, the United States has invested considerable time and money into the construction of a [[National Missile Defense]] system, a static defense grid capable of intercepting nuclear [[intercontinental ballistic missiles]].    

[[Island nation]]s, such as the [[United Kingdom]] or [[Japan]], and continental states with extensive [[coast]]s, such as the [[United States]], have utilized a naval presence to forestall an invasion of their country, rather than fortifying their border areas. A successful naval defense, however, usually requires a preponderance of naval power and an aggressive military strategy.

In particularly large nations, the defending force may also [[retreat]] in order to facilitate a [[counter attack]] by drawing the invaders deeper into hostile territory. One effect of this tactic is that the invading force becomes too spread out, making supply difficult and making the lines more susceptible to attack. This tactic, although costly, helped the Russians stop the German advance at [[Battle of Stalingrad|Stalingrad]].<ref>{{cite web | author=Matters, James T.| title=Stalingrad - The Nazis Reach Beyond Their Grasp| year=2003 | url= http://home.carolina.rr.com/burntofferings/CHAPT11.htm| accessdate=February 16 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> It can also cause the invading force to extend too far, allowing a [[pincer movement]] to cut them off from reinforcements. This was the cause of the British defeat at the [[Battle of Cowpens]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]].<ref>{{cite web | author=Withrow, Scott| title=The Battle of Cowpens| year=2005 | url= http://www.nps.gov/cowp/batlcowp.htm| accessdate=February 16 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> Finally, sending too many reinforcements can leave too few defenders in the attackers' territory, allowing a counter-invasion from other areas.

==Methods==
There are many different methods by which an invasion can take place, each method having arguments both in their favor and against. These include invasion by land, sea, or air, or any combination of these methods.

===Invasion by land===
[[Image:MoscowBattle.gif|right|thumb|175px|The [[Battle of Moscow]] during Operation Barbarossa.]]
Invasion over land is the straightforward entry of [[armed forces]] into an area using existing land connections, usually crossing borders or otherwise defined zones, such as a [[demilitarized zone]], overwhelming defensive emplacements and structures. Although this tactic often results in a quick victory, troop movements are relatively slow and subject to disruption by terrain and weather.  Furthermore, it is hard to conceal plans for this method of invasion, as most geopolitical entities take defensive positions in areas that are most vulnerable to the methods mentioned above.

In modern warfare, invasion by land often takes place after, or sometimes during, attacks on the target by other means. Air strikes and cruise missiles launched from ships at sea are a common method of "softening" the target. Other, more subtle, preparations may involve secretly garnering popular support, assassinating potentially threatening political or military figures, and closing off supply lines where they cross into neighboring countries. In some cases, those other means of attack eliminate the need for ground assault; the 1945 bombing of Japan ultimately made it unnecessary to invade the main islands with infantry troops. In cases such as this, while some ground troops are still needed to occupy the conquered territory, they are allowed to enter under the terms of a treaty and as such are no longer invaders. As unmanned, long-range combat evolves, the instances of basic overland invasion become fewer; often the conventional fighting is effectively over before the infantry arrives in the role of peacekeepers (see "[[Invasion#Applications in fourth generation warfare|Applications in fourth generation warfare]]" in this article).

===Invasion by sea===
[[Image:LCAC.jpg|thumb|175px|right|An [[Landing craft#Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC)|LCAC]] carrying armored vehicles ashore during the invasion of Iraq.]]
Invasion by sea is the use of a body of water to facilitate the entry of armed forces into an area, often a landmass adjoining the body of water or an island.  This is generally used either in conjunction with another method of invasion, and especially before the invention of [[flight]], for cases in which there is no other method to enter the territory in question. Arguments in favor of this method usually consist of the ability to perform a surprise attack from sea, or that naval defenses of the area in question are inadequate to repel such an attack. However, the large amount of specialized equipment, such as [[amphibious vehicles]] and the difficulty of establishing defenses<U+2014>usually with a resulting high [[casualty (person)|casualty count]]<U+2014>in exchange for a relatively small gain, are often used as arguments against such an invasion method. Underwater hazards and a lack of good cover are very common problems during invasions from the sea. At the [[Battle of Tarawa]], Marine landing craft became hung up on a coral reef and were shelled from the beach. Other landers were sunk before they could reach the shore, and the tanks they were carrying were stranded in the water. Most of the few survivors of the first wave ended up pinned down on the beach.<ref>{{cite web | author=Ashton, Douglas F.| title=Tarawa: Testing Ground For The Amphibious Assault| year=1989 | url= http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/1989/ADF.htm| accessdate=February 11 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> The island was conquered but at a heavy cost, and the loss of life sparked mass protests from civilians in the United States.

===Invasion by air===
[[Image:Waves of paratroops land in Holland.jpg|thumb|175px|right|Thousands of paratroopers descend during [[Operation Market Garden]].]]
Invasion by air is an invention of the 20th century and [[modern warfare]]. The idea involves sending military units into a territory by [[aircraft]]. The aircraft either land, allowing the military units to debark and attempt their objective, or the troops exit the aircraft while still in the air, using [[parachutes]] or similar devices to land in the territory being invaded. Many times air assaults have been used to pave the way for a ground- or sea-based invasion, by taking key positions deep behind enemy lines such as bridges and crossroads, but an entirely air-based invasion has never succeeded. One of the most immediate problems is the matter of resupply and reinforcement. An airborne force too large cannot be adequately supplied without meeting up with ground forces; an airborne force too small simply places themselves into an immediate envelopment situation. Arguments in favor of this method generally relate to the ability to target specific areas that may not necessarily be easily accessible by land or sea, a greater chance of surprising the enemy and overwhelming defensive structures, and, in many cases, the need for a reduced number of forces due to the element of surprise. Arguments against this method typically involve capacity to perform such an invasion&mdash;such as the sheer number of planes that would be needed to carry a sufficient number of troops&mdash;and the need for a high level of [[espionage|intelligence]] in order for the invasion to be successful. 

The closest examples to a true air invasion are the [[Battle of Crete]] and [[Operation Market Garden]]. [[Operation Market Garden]] was an assault on the German-occupied Netherlands conducted in September of 1944. Nearly 35,000 men were dropped by parachute and glider into enemy territory in an attempt to capture bridges from the Germans and make way for the Allies' advance. However, even with such a massive force taking the Germans completely by surprise, the assault was a tactical failure and after 9 days of fighting the Allies managed only to escape back to their own lines, having sustained over 18,000 casualties.<ref>{{cite book | title = Hell's Highway: Chronicle of the 101st Airborne Division in the Holland Campaign, September-November 1944 | author = Koskimaki, George E.  | year = 1989 | publisher = 101st Airborne Division Association | id = ISBN 187770203X}}</ref> In the 21st century, as vast improvements are made in anti-aircraft defenses, it seems that the air invasion is a strategy whose time may never come.

===Pacification===
[[Image:PSYOPS3ap.jpg|thumb|175px|right|US forces distribute propaganda on the streets of [[Kut|Kut, Iraq]].]]
Once political boundaries and military lines have been breached, pacification of the region is the final, and arguably the most important, goal of the invading force. After the defeat of the regular military, or when one is lacking, continued opposition to an invasion often comes from civilian or paramilitary [[resistance movement]]s. Complete pacification of an occupied country can be difficult, and sometimes impossible, but popular support is vital to the success of any invasion. 

Media [[propaganda]] such as leaflets, books, and radio broadcasts, can be used to encourage resistance fighters to surrender and to dissuade others from joining their cause. Pacification, often referred to as "the winning of hearts and minds", reduces the desire for civilians to take up resistance. This may be accomplished through [[brainwashing|reeducation]], allowing conquered citizens to participate in their government, or, especially in impoverished or besieged areas, simply by providing food, water, and shelter. Sometimes displays of military might are used; invading forces may assemble and parade through the streets of conquered towns, attempting to demonstrate the futility of any further fighting. These displays may also include public [[execution]]s of enemy soldiers, resistance fighters, and other conspirators. Particularly in antiquity, the death or imprisonment of a popular leader was sometimes enough to bring about a quick surrender. However, this has often had the unintended effect of creating [[martyr]]s around which popular resistance can rally. A notable example of this in recent times is [[Bobby Sands]], who died during a hunger strike in [[Maze (HM Prison)|Long Kesh prison]] and has become a symbol of the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]].<ref>{{cite web | author=Schuurman, J. and De Jong, P.| title= The Legacy of Bobby Sands| year=2001 | url= http://www.radionetherlands.nl/currentaffairs/region/westerneurope/sands010727.html| accessdate=February 14 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> 

Many factors need to be taken into account when deciding which tactics to use during occupation and, when the wrong decisions are made, it can lead to years (or even centuries) of continued resistance. The problems caused by continued resistance may be minimal if the conquered territory is only needed for a short-term tactical purpose, but can become extremely difficult if the intent is to colonize the area or hold the land indefinitely.

==Support==
===Logistics===
Without a steady flow of supplies, an invading force will soon find itself retreating. Before his invasion of Greece, Xerxes I spent three years amassing supplies from all over Asia; Herodotus wrote that the Persian army was so large it "drank the rivers dry".<ref>{{cite web | author=Rowland, Stephen| title=Persian society in the time of Darius and Xerxes| year=2005 | url= http://hsc.csu.edu.au/ancient_history/societies/near_east/2498/persian_army.html| accessdate=February 24 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> 

In most invasions, even in modern times, many fresh supplies are gathered from the invaded territories themselves. Before the [[laws of war]], invaders often relied heavily on the supplies they would win by conquering towns along the way. During the [[Second Punic War]], for example, [[Hannibal]] diverted his army to conquer cities simply to gather supplies; his strategy in crossing the alps necessitated traveling with as few provisions as possible, expecting the Roman stores to sustain them when they had breached the border.<ref>{{cite web | author=Polybius| title=The Histories, Book III| year=1922 | url= http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Polybius/3*.html#100| accessdate=February 24 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> The [[scorched earth]] tactics used in Russia forced Napoleon to withdraw his forces due to lack of food and shelter. Today, the [[Law of land warfare]] forbids [[looting]] and the confiscation of private property, but local supplies, particularly perishables, are still purchased when possible for use by occupying forces, and airplanes often use parachutes to drop supplies to besieged forces. Even as rules become more strict, the necessities of war become more numerous; in addition to food, shelter, and ammunition, today's militaries require fuel, batteries, spare mechanical parts, electronic equipment, and many other things. In the United States, the [[Defense Logistics Agency]] employs over 22,000 civilians with the sole task of logistics support, and 30,000 soldiers graduate from the U.S. Army Logistics Management College each year.<ref>{{cite web | author=U.S. Army| title=Background of ALMC| year=2005 | url= http://www.almc.army.mil/| accessdate=February 24 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

===Communication===
[[Image:SOTM.jpg|thumb|175px|right|A mobile satellite communications center.]]
Another consideration is the importance of leadership being able to communicate with the invasion force. In ancient times, this often meant that a king needed to lead his armies in person to be certain his commands were followed, as in the case of Alexander the Great. At that time, the skills needed to lead troops in battle were as important as the skills needed to run a country during peacetime. When it was necessary for the king to be elsewhere, messengers would relay updates back to the rear, often on horseback or, in cases such as the [[Battle of Marathon]], with swift runners.

When possible, [[sloops]] and [[cutters]] were used to relay information by sea. The [[HMS Pickle]] brought Britain the first news that [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Nelson]] had defeated the French forces at the [[Battle of Trafalgar]].

The development of [[Morse Code]], and later voice communications by radio and satellite, have allowed even small units of skirmishers to remain in contact with the larger invasion force, to verify orders or call for artillery support and air strikes. These communications were critical to the German [[blitzkrieg]] strategy, as infantry commanders relayed defensive positions to tanks and bombers.

==Applications in fourth generation warfare==
In the 20th and 21st century, questions arose regarding the effectiveness of the invasion strategy in [[fourth generation warfare]]. In this case, one or more combatant groups are controlled not by a centralized state government but by independent leadership, and these groups may be made up of civilians, foreign agents, mercenaries, politicians, religious leaders, and members of the regular military. These groups act in smaller numbers, are not confined by borders, and do not necessarily depend on the direct support of the state. Groups such as these are not easily defeated by straightforward invasion, or even constant occupation; the country's regular army may be defeated, the government may be replaced, but [[asymmetric warfare]] on the part of these groups can be continued indefinitely.<ref>{{cite web | author=Hackworth, David H.| title=Fallujah: Saved for Democracy?| year=2004 | url= http://www.military.com/Opinions/0,,Hackworth_111804,00.html| accessdate=February 19 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> Because regular armed forces units do not have the flexibility and independence of small [[covert cell]]s, many believe that the concept of a powerful occupying force actually creates a disadvantage.<ref>{{cite web | author= Lind, William S.| title= Understanding Fourth Generation War| year=2003 | url= http://www.military.com/NewContent/0,13190,Lind_121903,00.html | accessdate=February 19 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

An opposing theory is that fourth generation war is necessitated by extremist ideology and unjust governments; if an invasion can change the government and reeducate the people, prolonged reistance is unlikely and future violence can be averted. This theory acknowledges that these changes may take time&mdash;generations, in some cases&mdash;but holds that immediate benefits may still be won by reducing membership in, and choking the supply lines of, these covert cells. Proponents of the invasion strategy in fourth generation warfare maintain the belief that a strong occupying force can still succeed in its goals on a tactical level, building upon numerous small victories, similar to a war of attrition.<ref>{{cite web | author=North, Oliver L.| title= Winning in Iraq, One Step at a Time| year=2005 | url= http://www.military.com/Opinions/0,,FreedomAlliance_051905,00.html | accessdate=February 19 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

The concept of fourth generation warfare is quite new, so neither side can claim to know for certain which strategies will ultimately solve the problem. Opponents of the invasion strategy point to a lack of examples in which occupying or [[peacekeeping]] forces have met with conclusive success.<ref>Lind, William S., op. cit.</ref> They also cite continuing conflicts such as [[The Troubles|Northern Ireland]], [[Al-Aqsa Intifada|Israel]], [[Second Chechen War|Chechnya]], and [[Casualties of the conflict in Iraq since 2003|Iraq]], as well as examples which they claim ultimately proved to be failures, such as [[Multinational Force in Lebanon|Lebanon]], and [[Soviet war in Afghanistan|Afghanistan]]. Supporters of the invasion strategy hold that it is too soon to call those situations failures, and that patience is needed to see the plan through. Some say that the invasions themselves have, in fact, been successful, but that political opponents<ref>{{cite web | author=North, Oliver L.| title= Operation Pessimism and Perplexity| year=2004 | url= http://www.military.com/Opinions/0,,FreedomAlliance_100704,00.html | accessdate=February 19 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> and the international media<ref>{{cite web | author=Moore, Steven| title=The Truth About Iraq: Media Bias| year=2004 | url= http://www.thetruthaboutiraq.org/media.htm| accessdate=February 19 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> skew the facts for sensationalism or political gain.

==Outcomes==
The outcomes of an invasion may vary according to the objectives of both invaders and defenders, the success of the invasion and the defense, and the presence or absence of an agreed settlement between the warring parties. The most common outcome is the loss of territory, generally accompanied by a change in government and often the loss of direct control of that government by the losing faction. This sometimes results in the transformation of that country into a [[client state]], often accompanied by requirements to pay [[War reparations|reparations]] or [[tribute]] to the victor. In rare cases the results of a successful invasion may simply be a return to the [[status quo]]; this can be seen in [[Attrition warfare|wars of attrition]], when the destruction of personnel and supplies is the main strategic objective.<ref>{{cite web | author=Brush, Peter| title=Civic Action: The Marine Corps Experience in Vietnam| year=1994 | url= http://www.library.vanderbilt.edu/central/brush/CivicAction.htm| accessdate=February 11 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

==Record-setting invasions==
Many records for invasions were set during World War II, at the peak of [[second generation warfare|second]] and [[third generation warfare]]. The vast numbers of the armies involved combined with revolutionary tactics and technology lent themselves, arguably for the last time in history, to invasions on a massive scale. 

The bloodiest invasion in history was the allies' attempted invasion of Japan. Of that invasion, the bloodiest battle was the [[battle of Okinawa]]; from April 15 to June 21, 1945, 18,900 allied troops were killed, 38,000 were wounded, and over 100,000 Japanese troops were killed (many by suicide). There were also approximately 150,000 civilian casualties. It is estimated that if the invasion had continued to [[Operation Downfall|Kyushu and Honshu]], many hundreds of thousands more would have been killed. The atomic bombs forced the Japanese surrender and halted the invasion before this could happen. Over the course of the [[Pacific War|Pacific campaign]], more than 370,000 [[Purple Heart]]s were awarded.

The largest invasion in history was 1941's [[Operation Barbarossa]], in which 4,000,000 German troops blitzkrieged into Russia. The Germans advanced with ease at first and nearly captured [[Battle of Moscow|Moscow]], also laying siege to [[Battle of Leningrad|Leningrad]], but soon found themselves fighting the harsh Russian winter and fierce Soviet resistance, and their advance ground to a halt at Stalingrad in early 1943.

In the largest amphibious invasion in history, nearly 3,000,000 Allied troops landed at [[Battle of Normandy|Normandy]] to retake France from the occupying German forces commanded by [[Erwin Rommel|Rommel]]. Though it was costly, the invasion advanced the Western front and forced Germany to redirect its forces from the Russian and Italian fronts. In hindsight, it is also credited with defining the Western boundary of Soviet communism; had the Allies not advanced, it is conceivable that the Soviet Union would have controlled even more of Europe than they eventually did.

Another record was set in more recent years: beginning on March 20 and ending on April 15, the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] was the fastest invasion in history.<ref>{{cite web | author=Donaldson-Evans, Catherine| title=Bush Praises 3rd Infantry Division| year=2003 | url= http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,97145,00.html| accessdate=February 24 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>
A [[Multinational force in Iraq|coalition force]], composed mainly of military units of the United States and United Kingdom, staged near-simultaneous air- and land-based assaults on Iraq. The invasion succeeded in removing [[Saddam Hussein]] and the [[Baath Party]] from power, but continued fighting during the ensuing occupation fueled debate about the validity of invasion strategies in the 21st century.<ref>{{cite web | author=Lind, William S.| title= Understanding Fourth Generation War| year=2003 | url= http://www.military.com/NewContent/0,13190,Lind_121903,00.html | accessdate=February 19 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

==Other examples of historically significant invasions==

===[[Assyria#Sargonid .28dynasty.29|Assyrian invasion of the Kingdom of Israel]]===
[[Sargon II]], during the course of conquering much of what is now known as the [[Middle East]], defeated the [[Kingdom of Israel]] in [[720s BC|722 BC]] and sent its inhabitants into exile. This presaged future Greek and Roman conquest and, later, the [[Crusades]]. To this day, the region remains contested.<ref>{{cite book|title = A History of the Ancient Near East|author = Van De Mieroop, Marc|year = 2005|publisher = Blackwell Publishing | id = ISBN 0631225528}}</ref>

===[[Battle of Thermopylae|Persian invasion of Greece]]===
In 480 BC, [[Xerxes I of Persia]] moved his armies against the loose confederation of city-states in what is modern-day Greece. One of the most famous battles of the war, fought at [[Battle of Thermopylae|Thermopylae]], is an early example of using a [[bottleneck|chokepoint]] to tactical advantage. Although Xerxes' army was vast&mdash;modern estimates put it at 250,000&mdash;the defending Greeks were able to hold their ground for days by using a narrow mountain pass to slow the Persian advance. The invasion also demonstrates the importance of communication and supply routes; although Xerxes' land battles were almost all Persian victories, the Greeks managed to cut off his naval support and the Persians were forced to withdraw. The invasion served to unify the various city-states, bringing about the formation of the Greek nation.<ref>Ibid.</ref>

===[[Persian Empire#Hellenistic Persia (330 BC<U+2013>150 BC)|Macedonian conquest of the Persian Empire]]=== 
In 323 BC, [[Alexander the Great]] led his army into [[Persian Empire#The first Persian state: Achaemenid Persia (648 BC<U+2013>330 BC)|Persia]], defeating [[Darius III]], conquering Babylon, and taking control of the Persian Empire. Alexander's influence in mixing cultures led to the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic Age]] of [[Mesopotamia]] and North Africa.<ref>Ibid.</ref>

===[[Islamic conquests|The Islamic Conquests]]===
Following [[Muhammad]]'s unification of the [[Arabian peninsula]] in 632, his successors in the [[Caliphate]] began a series of invasions of the Middle East, North Africa, Southern Europe, and South Asia. Lasting slighly more than a century, these conquests brought much of the ancient world under the banner of Islam and represent the zenith of Islamic political power.

===[[Crusade|The Crusades]]===
In a series of nine different major invasions, from 1095 to 1291, the Catholic Church attempted to conquer the [[Holy Land]] from its [[Muslim]] rulers, with varied success. As Jerusalem changed hands and [[Europe]]an forces moved back and forth, in-roads to the [[Levant]] were reestablished and the cultures mixed on a large scale for the first time in centuries.<ref>{{cite book|title = The Oxford History of the Crusades|author = Riley-Smith, John |year = 1995|publisher = Oxford | id = ISBN 0192854283}}</ref>

===[[Genghis Khan#Military campaigns|Genghis Khan<U+2019>s invasions of China]]=== 
From 1206 until his death in 1227, Genghis Khan orchestrated a series of invasions that united much of Asia. Relying heavily on cavalry, the Mongol hordes were able to travel quickly yet were well-supplied. By 1368, the [[Mongol Empire]] was the largest contiguous empire in history, comprised of 35 million km<U+00B2> (13.8 million miles<U+00B2>) of territory stretched across the continent. His eastward invasion of China created the [[Yuan Dynasty]], and his westward invasion of [[Kiev Rus]] further linked Europe and Asia by reestablishing the [[Silk Road]].

===[[Siege of Tenochtitlan|Conquest of the Aztec Empire]]===
The last of the Aztec empire was destroyed at [[Tenochtitlan]] in 1521, by a combination of Spanish and native forces. Aided by 2,000 local [[Tlaxcala]]n warriors, [[Hern<U+00E1>n Cort<U+00E9>s]] marched into the city. Although he and his men were expelled, they returned with ships and laid siege to the capital. Though an epidemic of smallpox took its toll on the Aztecs, Cortes' conquest was the culmination of Spanish strategy in the Americas: He used promises to gain native allies, he burned and killed thousands of people to strike fear into his enemies, and he combined superior technology with patience while he struck at Tenochtitlan from the sea. This opened the door to Spanish colonization of mainland [[Mesoamerica]]n tribes. 

===[[Napoleon's invasion of Russia|French invasion of Russia]]===
In [[1812]], [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] led his [[Grande Arm<U+00E9>e]] into Russia. At that point, his invasion force of 691,500 men was the largest ever assembled, and for several weeks the Russian Army could do nothing but retreat and try to buy time. The first major battle between the two armies, at the Russian defenses of [[Battle of Borodino|Borodino]], was one of the bloodiest single days in human history, with estimates of at least 65,000 dead. But although the Russian retreat allowed the French to capture [[Moscow]], they were left depleted and without shelter or supplies. Napoleon was forced to withdraw. Although this invasion was not the end of Napoleon, it is credited with fostering a powerful patriotism in Russia that would lead to the strengthening of the nation in the 19th and 20th centuries.
