"'''Encounter at Farpoint'''" is the first episode of the [[science fiction]] [[television program]] ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]''. It was written by series creator [[Gene Roddenberry]] and directed by [[Corey Allen]]. In syndication, it's aired as the series' first 2 episodes (Parts I & II).

The episode premiered on 28 September, 1987<ref name=startrek.com>[http://www.startrek.com/database_article/encounter-at-farpoint-part-i ''Encounter at Farpoint'', Part I] ''Startrek.com'' Retrieved on October 25, 2010</ref> and was the first new live-action episode of ''[[Star Trek]]'' to have been created since 1969.

The crew of the newly built [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D)|USS Enterprise-D]] examine the mysterious Farpoint Station which the enigmatic [[Bandi (Star Trek)|Bandi]] people are offering to the [[United Federation of Planets|Federation]], while under the judgmental gaze of a powerful alien entity that calls itself [[Q (Star Trek)|Q]].

==Plot==
The newest flagship of the United Federation of Planets, [[Starfleet]]'s USS ''Enterprise'' NCC-1701-D, is assigned to travel to '''Deneb IV''' for its first mission out of drydock, both to collect the remaining members of its crew and to open relations with the simple [[List of Star Trek races#Bandi|Bandi]] people who have somehow been able to tap immense energy reserves and constructed Farpoint Station, much to the surprise of the [[United Federation of Planets]]. En route, the ''Enterprise'' is met by an [[Omnipotence|omnipotent]] being who identifies himself as a member of the [[Q (Star Trek)|Q continuum]] and declares that humanity is being put on trial - posing in appearance as a Grand Inquisitor, invoking a chapter of the same name in Dostoyevsky's 'The Brothers Karamazov' which includes the lines "I think if the devil doesn't exist, but man has created him, he has created him in his own image and likeness," demonstrating the preconceived notions of the Q concerning humanity's quality as a species - using their actions in this upcoming mission to judge their worthiness and to avoid extermination. Before letting the ship continue to Deneb IV, Q warns [[Jean-Luc Picard|Captain Picard]] that he is destined to fail.

As the ''Enterprise'' arrives, the awaiting crew members explore the offerings of Farpoint Station led by their Bandi host, Groppler Zorn. The crew is suspicious of how certain items they desire appear moments after they look away and are unable to identify the power source that feeds the station.  [[Deanna Troi]], an empath, senses a being with powerful yet despairing emotions nearby, and others of the crew discover a strange labyrinth beneath the station, but Zorn is unable to offer an explanation.  As the ''Enterprise'' crew continues its explorations, a large unknown alien craft enters orbit and begins to fire upon an older Bandi settlement near Farpoint Station and abducts Zorn.  Before Picard orders the crew to fire phasers at the craft, Q appears to remind him of humanity's trial and prompts Picard to send an away team to the alien craft.  The away team discovers the craft has passages similar to those under Farpoint and are able to free Zorn.  Their actions cause the alien craft to transform into a [[jellyfish]]-like space creature, and Picard is able to deduce the mystery of Farpoint Station.  He confirms with the apologetic Zorn that the Bandi had found a similar lifeform injured on their planet and, though they attempted to care for it, they also exploited its ability to create matter to create Farpoint Station. The creature now in orbit is trying to help free its mate by punishing those who ensnared it.

Though Q goads Picard into punishing the Bandi, Picard refuses, instead ordering the ''Enterprise'' to fire a vivifying energy beam onto Farpoint after the station is evacuated.  The beam allows the land-bound creature to transform back into its jellyfish-like form, and it flies into orbit to join its fellow being.  As the crew watches the reunion of the alien creatures, Q reluctantly tells Picard that they have succeeded in their test, but hints that they will meet again.

==Production==
The episode features a [[cameo appearance]] by [[DeForest Kelley]] as Admiral [[Leonard McCoy]]. This was the first of several eventual appearances by Original Series cast members on the series; the others being "[[Sarek (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Sarek]]" ([[Mark Lenard]]) in "[[Unification (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Unification I]]", [[Spock]] ([[Leonard Nimoy]]) in "[[Unification (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Unification II]]", and [[Montgomery Scott|Scotty]] ([[James Doohan]]) in "[[Relics (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Relics]]".

It also started the tradition that the first episode of each new ''Star Trek'' series (set in the 24th century) include an appearance by a prominent character from a previous ''Star Trek'' series:  ''TNG''{{'}}s Captain [[Jean-Luc Picard]] ([[Patrick Stewart]]) in the ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' premiere and ''DS9''{{'}}s [[Ferengi]] bartender [[Quark (Star Trek)|Quark]] ([[Armin Shimerman]]) in the ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'' premiere. Enterprise followed this tradition as well by featuring James Cromwell as Zefram Cochrane, reprising his role from Star Trek: First Contact.

==Reception==

Michelle Erica Green, reviewing the episode for ''[[TrekNation]]'', found the episode disappointing with reference to the character of Captain Picard and the female crew members and a lack of sense of fun.<ref name="MEGreen">{{Cite news |last=Green |first=Michelle Erica |title="Encounter At Farpoint"|publisher=[[TrekNation]]|date=16 February 2007 |url=http://www.trektoday.com/reviews/tos/encounter_at_farpoint.shtml|accessdate=22 August 2011}}</ref>

Actor Wil Wheaton, also reviewing the episode years later for ''[[TV Squad]]'', gave the episode a 'C-' grade, suggesting that "at the time, [[Trekkies]] who were hoping to see the Star Trek that they were used to from the sixties must have been disappointed".<ref name="TV Squad">{{Cite news |last=Wheaton |first=Wil |title=Star Trek: The Next Generation: Encounter at Farpoint (Part I) (series premiere)|publisher=[[Weblogs, Inc.]]|date=3 January 2007 |url=http://www.aoltv.com/2007/01/03/star-trek-the-next-generation-encounter-at-farpoint-part-i/|accessdate=22 August 2011}}</ref>
