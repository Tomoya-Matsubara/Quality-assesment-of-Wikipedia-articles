'''Route 75''' in the [[U.S. state]]s of [[Connecticut]] and [[Massachusetts]] is a {{convert|17.5|mi|km|adj=on}} scenic route connecting the [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]] and [[Springfield, Massachusetts|Springfield]] areas. The route begins at [[Route 159 (Connecticut)|Route 159]] in the town of [[Windsor, Connecticut]] and ends at the junction of [[Route 159 (Massachusetts)|Route 159]] and [[Route 147 (Massachusetts)|Route 147]] in the city of [[Agawam, Massachusetts]].

The route acquired its modern designation in the [[1932 state highway renumbering (Connecticut)|1932 state highway renumbering]], becoming a loop route off then [[U.S. Route 5A (Connecticut)|U.S. Route 5A]] (modern [[Route 159 (Connecticut)|Route 159]]) through the town center of [[Suffield, Connecticut|Suffield]]. In 1950, the north end was realigned to extend into Agawam. The portion in Agawam is a municipal road and is not a [[state highway]] (i.e. not a state-maintained road). 

== Route description==
Route 75 begins as ''Poquonock Avenue'' at [[Route 159 (Connecticut)|Route 159]] in the town center of [[Windsor, Connecticut|Windsor]] near the [[Windsor (Amtrak station)|Windsor]] railroad station and heads northwest parallel to the [[Farmington River]]. It has an interchange with [[I-91]] at Exit 38 about {{convert|1.8|mi|km}} northwest of Route 159, where Route 75 also passes in front of [[Day Hill Mall]]. After another {{convert|2.1|mi|km}}, Route 75 crosses over the [[Farmington River]] into the village of [[Poquonock, Connecticut|Poquonock]], and then has an interchange with the [[Bradley Airport Connector]] at the Windsor-[[Windsor Locks, Connecticut|Windsor Locks]] town line. 

Route 75, known as ''Ella T. Grasso Turnpike'' in Windsor Locks, proceeds north along the eastern perimeter of [[Bradley International Airport]]. In this area, it intersects with [[SSR 401]], which leads to the airport. Further north along Route 75, one can access the indoor airport parking facility and the entrance to [[Crown Industrial Park]]. Upon entering the town of [[Suffield, Connecticut|Suffield]], the road becomes ''South Street'' as it heads into the town center, where the road name changes to ''South Main Street'' and ''North Main Street''. Route 75 has junctions with [[Route 168 (Connecticut)|Route 168]] (towards [[Southwick, Massachusetts|Southwick]]) and [[Route 190 (Connecticut)|Route 190]] (towards [[Enfield, Connecticut|Enfield]]) in Suffield center. In northern Suffield, Route 75 is known as ''North Street'' and eventually crosses the state line into [[Agawam, Massachusetts]].<ref name=ctlog/>

In Massachusetts, Route 75 passes through the villages of Hubbard Corner and Suffield Corner within the city of Agawam heading into the downtown area. The road has an interchange with the expressway section of [[Route 57 (Massachusetts)|Route 57]] north of Suffield Corner. Route 75 ends at the intersection of [[Route 147 (Massachusetts)|Route 147]] and [[Route 159 (Massachusetts)|Route 159]] in Agawam center just south of the [[West Springfield, Massachusetts|West Springfield]] city line.

== History ==
In the 1920s, when Connecticut first numbered its state highways, the road between [[Windsor, Connecticut|Windsor]] center and [[Suffield, Connecticut|Suffield]] center via the village of [[Poquonock, Connecticut|Poquonock]] was a secondary route designated as '''State Highway 362'''. Old Highway 362 was renumbered to Route 75 as part of the [[1932 state highway renumbering (Connecticut)|1932 state highway renumbering]]. The original Route 75 continued past Suffield center along Mapleton Avenue (modern Route 190) to end at US 5A (modern Route  159). The route was extended north to the Massachusetts state line and into the city of Agawam in 1950. While numbered as Route 75, the road in Agawam is not officially a state highway and is maintained by the city. The former connection to US 5A became an unsigned state road for several years until the relocation of Route 190.<ref>[http://www.kurumi.com/roads/ct/ctx75.html#75 Connecticut Routes, Route 75]</ref>

==Special designations==
The northernmost {{convert|4.3|mi|km}} of Route 75 within the town of Suffield is a designated ''state scenic road''. 

The portion of Route 75 in Windsor Locks was originally known as ''Turnpike Road'' and still appears as such on some maps, including [[Google Maps]].  Its alignment alongside [[Bradley International Airport]] sustained heavy damage on October 3, 1979, when a [[Windsor Locks, Connecticut tornado|F4 tornado]] destroyed or damaged many businesses and residences along the corridor, including the original [[New England Air Museum|Bradley Air Museum]].  In 1981, as enacted by Public Act 81-463, this portion of Route 75, by then repaired and revitalized, was officially renamed the ''[[Ella T. Grasso]] Turnpike'', in honor of the first elected female governor in the [[United States]] (and a native of Windsor Locks).
