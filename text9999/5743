He was the youngest ever winner of a ranking tournament when he won the 1993 [[UK Championship (snooker)|UK Championship]] aged 17, beating Stephen Hendry in the final, and starting one of the most prominent rivalries in the sport. In 1995, he won his first [[Masters (snooker)|Masters]] title.

In the [[World Snooker Championship 1996|1996 World Championship]], snooker's governing body found him guilty of assaulting Mike Ganley, then a media official, now the tournament director.<ref>{{Cite web

O'Sullivan made it to the semi-finals of the [[World Snooker Championship 1999|1999 Embassy World Championship]], but lost 13&ndash;17 to Stephen Hendry; the last four frames of the third session featured four successive centuries, two from Hendry and two from O'Sullivan. Following his solid performance the previous year, O'Sullivan's promising campaign in the [[Snooker season 1999/200|1999<U+2013>2000 season]] (when he won three ranking titles) ended in disappointment. He was a favourite for the [[World Snooker Championship 2000|2000 world title]], especially after an unexpected loss by Hendry to [[Stuart Bingham]] in the first round, but O'Sullivan was also eliminated in the first round by [[David Gray (snooker player)|David Gray]], who struggled back from 1&ndash;5 and 7&ndash;9 down to edge out O'Sullivan 10&ndash;9 for a place in the second round. In that match O'Sullivan made five centuries (three in consecutive frames, equalling the record held by [[John Higgins (snooker player)|John Higgins]]), all to no avail, while Gray recorded four.

In 2001, O'Sullivan claimed his first [[World Snooker Championship 2001|World Championship]] title (which he dedicated to his father), with an 18&ndash;14 victory over Higgins, and his third UK title, with a 10&ndash;1 victory over Doherty. He began the 2002/2003 season ranked [[Snooker world number ones|number 1]].

===After the first world title===

In 2002 at the [[World Snooker Championship 2002|World Championship]] Hendry and O'Sullivan were set to meet in the semifinals, O'Sullivan having edged out [[Stephen Lee]] in a quarter-final match, 13&ndash;10, and Hendry winning his quarter-final match over Doherty. At a pre-match interview O'Sullivan said, referring to a previous match against Hendry in 1999: "I know if I do get beat and he comes up and does a moonie in front of me and goes 'Ne ne ne', I'll just look at him and say 'well done' and say 'go back to your sad little life'.<ref>{{Cite web

Hendry subsequently outplayed O'Sullivan and won convincingly 17&ndash;13. After the match, O'Sullivan accused Hendry of poor sportsmanship, referring to his conduct over a mis-shot at an unnamed prior tournament.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/snooker/2377897/Snooker-Hendry-talks-up-OSullivan-ahead-of-Embassy-clash.html|title=Snooker: Hendry talks up O'Sullivan ahead of Embassy clash|last=Dee|first=John|date=29 April 2004|work=The Daily Telegraph|publisher=Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=19 February 2010}}</ref> Hendry didn't comment on his opponent's outburst, although O'Sullivan did receive some criticism for his remarks from Steve Davis and [[Clive Everton]].

Another successful season followed in [[Snooker season 2002/2003|2002/2003]], with O'Sullivan reaching the last 16 of seven ranking tournaments and winning the [[Scottish Masters (snooker)|Scottish Masters]], the [[European Open (snooker)|European Open]] and [[Irish Masters (snooker)|Irish Masters]], defeating Higgins in the Scottish and Irish finals, and Hendry in the European, and starting the 2003 World Championship as runaway favourite. O'Sullivan's season ended on a disappointing note however when he was knocked out of the World Championship in the first round for the third time in his career, losing 10&ndash;6 to the unseeded [[Marco Fu]], despite making four century breaks - including another maximum 147 break - in the match. This defeat saw him drop to number three in the rankings.

In 2004, O'Sullivan's father telephoned 1970s six-time World Champion [[Ray Reardon]] and asked if he could give O'Sullivan some advice.<ref name="Reardon">{{Cite web

The [[World Snooker Championship 2006|2006 World Championship]] saw O'Sullivan's personal sponsor, 888.com, also become the event sponsor for the following three years. Following a 10&ndash;4 defeat of [[Dave Harold]], he struggled through 13&ndash;10 in a second-round match against [[Wales|Welshman]] [[Ryan Day]]. A similar quarter-final match ensued against [[Mark Williams (Welsh snooker player)|Mark Williams]]. O'Sullivan led 10&ndash;6 going into the final session. A fightback from Williams saw him take the lead by winning the next five frames, but O'Sullivan held his nerve to take the match 13&ndash;11, and faced Graeme Dott in the semi-finals. Dott took an early lead before O'Sullivan drew level at 8&ndash;8 at the end of the second session. Cue-tip problems which had dogged O'Sullivan throughout the event recurred, including an incident in which television footage appeared to show O'Sullivan deliberately removing the tip of his cue. This secured him a 15-minute break to re-tip the cue, before he returned and made a 124 break. Tournament Director Mike Ganley accepted the player's assurance that the tip had simply fallen off, and no censure was made.<ref name="21tips">{{Cite web

O'Sullivan withdrew from the first ranking event of the season, the [[2007 Shanghai Masters|Shanghai Masters]], citing back problems which doctors advised him not to travel on. He also chose not to enter the invitational [[Pot Black]] tournament.

O'Sullivan made the final of the [[2007 Grand Prix (snooker)|Grand Prix]], but was lost 6&ndash;9 against [[Marco Fu]].

During the [[2007 Northern Ireland Trophy]] O'Sullivan set a new record after compiling five centuries in a 5&ndash;2 defeat of Ali Carter. This also included his seventh, official competitive 147 maximum break.<ref>{{Cite web

In the battle of the top two players in the provisional world rankings, O'Sullivan fought back from 4&ndash;1 down to level at 5&ndash;5 and take the match into a deciding eleventh frame. But O'Sullivan missed a relatively simple final blue with the rest, when poised to win the match, allowing Maguire to reach the quarter-finals.<ref>{{Cite web

In a tense final against defending champion [[Mark Selby]], neither player was able to obtain a sizeable lead, with frames littered with both big breaks and close finishes. After leading 3&ndash;1, O'Sullivan ended the afternoon session at 4&ndash;4, and took the first frame of the evening session. Selby, however, then won the next 3 frames to lead 7&ndash;5. O'Sullivan responded by himself taking three frames in succession to lead 8&ndash;7. The following two frames were shared, and at 9&ndash;8, after both players had wasted chances, O'Sullivan constructed a break of 55, beating [[Mark Selby]] 10&ndash;8 and thereby claiming the title for the fourth time. In doing this, he became only the second player, after [[Stephen Hendry]], to win the trophy more than three times. In his post-match interview, O'Sullivan cited his victory, composed with a cue that he obtained only the previous Saturday, as his greatest achievement in snooker.<ref>{{citeweb
