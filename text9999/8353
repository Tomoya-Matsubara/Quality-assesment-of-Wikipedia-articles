'''Project Alpha''' was a [[hoax]] orchestrated by magician and [[skeptic]] [[James Randi]]. It involved planting two fake [[psychic]]s, [[Banachek|Steve Shaw]] and Michael Edwards,<!-- this Micheal Edwards is neither of the people with this name having a Wikipedia article as of March 2006--> into a [[paranormal]] research project. The researchers became convinced that the pair's psychic powers were real. The hoax was later revealed publicly, leading to a backlash against the entire paranormal field.

The success of Project Alpha led Randi to use variations of the technique on several other occasions. Perhaps the most famous example led to the downfall of [[TV evangelist]] and [[faith healer]] [[Peter Popoff]], when Randi had a man pose as a woman with uterine cancer, which Popoff happily "cured". In another example, Randi hired a [[performance artist]] to pose as a [[channeller]] known as "Carlos", who was presented on [[Australian]] television and soon had a wide following. After this hoax was exposed the artist was constantly approached by people who believed him to be genuine, even if he told them directly that he was an actor.

== Peter Phillips' experiments ==

In [[1979]] [[James S. McDonnell]], board chairman of [[McDonnell Douglas]] and believer in the paranormal, awarded a [[United States dollar|USD]] $500,000 grant to [[Washington University]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], for the establishment of the McDonnell Laboratory for Psychical Research. He intended the money to be used for serious study of [[parapsychology|psychic]] phenomena in a controlled setting. The lab was led by [[physicist]] Peter Phillips, who decided to focus on [[spoon bending]] by children, technically known as "psychokinetic metal bending", or PKMB.

Before the testing had started, James Randi had written to the lab with a list of eleven "caveats" they should be wary of, and his suggestions on how to avoid them. These included a rigid adherence to the protocol of the test, so that the subjects would not be allowed to change it in the midst of the run. This had been the [[modus operandi]] of [[Uri Geller]] while being tested at [[Stanford Research Institute]]; whenever something did not work, he simply did something else instead. Other suggestions included having only one object of study at any time, permanently marking the object or objects used so they could not be switched, and having as few people in the room as possible to avoid distractions. Randi also offered his services to watch the experiments as a control, noting that a [[conjurer]] would be an excellent person to look for fakery. Phillips did not take him up on the offer. In Randi's letters, he even told the researchers that the subjects were fake, but the researchers did not check out their backgrounds {{Harvcol|Gardner|1983}}. 

Throughout the early phases of the project, many people claiming to have psychic powers presented themselves to the lab. The vast majority quickly proved to have no such ability, or, just as commonly, used [[sleight of hand]] to make their "abilities" work. Many of these were convinced what they were doing was "real".

== Steve Shaw and Michael Edwards ==

However, after a short while it became apparent that two of the young men, [[Banachek|Steve Shaw]] and Michael Edwards, were in fact much better than the others, and the lab started to focus their energies on them. In fact, the two young men were plants of Randi's, friends of Randi whom he had met some time before. Part of Randi's instructions to these men was to tell the truth if they were ever asked if they were faking the results. They were never asked.

Shaw and Edwards were amateur magicians who had no problems fooling the researchers with fairly simple tricks. The project had originally started with spoon bending, so the two quickly developed a way to accomplish this trick. Contrary to one of the caveats Randi noted in his letter, the test setup included not one, but many and all sorts of spoons on the table, labeled with paper on a loop of string instead of some permanent marking. When starting to bend a spoon they would actually pick up two or more and remove the labels, which they were allowed to do, because they claimed they were in the way. They would then simply switch the labels when putting them back and wait. The spoons were measured before and after the experiment, and since all sorts of spoons were used, simply switching the labels would produce different measurements, causing the scientist to believe that something paranormal had happened. In other cases, they would drop one of the spoons in their lap and bend it below the table with one hand, while pretending to bend a spoon in their other hand, distracting the scientists with that.

One particular camera operator proved to be able to catch them at this every time, even after they tried to get him to "zoom in on the action" and miss what was going on in their other hand. They took to getting annoyed by his "bad vibes," waited until he was asked to leave, and then continued as before with a more suggestible and less competent cameraman. This was also a clear violation of one of Randi's caveats; the test run should have been stopped at this point and recorded as a failure.

The two were so successful at spoon bending that several other tests were invented. In one they were given pictures in sealed envelopes and then asked to try to identify them from a list shown to them later. The two were left alone in a room with the envelopes, and although there was a possibility that they would peek, this was "controlled" by examining the envelopes later. The envelopes were held closed with four staples, which they simply pried open with their fingernails, looked at the picture, and then resealed by inserting the staples back into the same holes and forcing them closed against the table.

In another test the experiment was electronic in nature; they were asked to influence the burnout point of a common [[fuse (electrical)|fuse]]. After they "worked it" with their mind, an increasing amount of current was run through it until it blew. The two proved to have amazing abilities in this test after a few trials, eventually causing the fuses to blow immediately once they "got used to it". In fact they were simply palming the already blown fuses and then handing them back to the experimenters. They also found that by pressing down on one end of the fuse in its holder, or just touching it briefly, the instruments recorded unusual results that were interpreted by the experimenters as [[Psi (parapsychology)|PSI]] effects.

In one instance Shaw and Edwards were asked to move small objects in a sealed transparent container, normally small bits of paper balanced on an edge. Shaw and Edwards realized that the "sealed" container really wasn't.  They spotted small openings and simply blew through them.

Other examples included their ability to make digital clocks stop working properly (they popped them in a microwave for a few seconds), or make images appear on film just by staring at the camera (they spat on the lens). In an example of a sort of [[Rorschach inkblot test|Rorschach]] test, the experimenters later described the images as being various bits of the female anatomy, which, "of course", teenage boys would be interested in.

The attitude of the researchers was illustrated in one particular experiment, when Steve Shaw was trying to get them to say on film that he was not allowed to touch the object he was supposed to bend in the experiment (he had already secretly done that, and with them affirming that he could not and had not touched it, the 'miracle' would look even greater). When Shaw asked: "Can I touch it?", the reply was, to his surprise: "You do what you have to do".

== Revelation and aftermath ==

In mid-1981 the two were fairly famous in the [[PSI]] world, and even outside it, and Phillips was planning on releasing a full report of their powers at a PSI meeting in August. After the announcements in the press, Randi wrote to the lab again and stated that it was entirely possible the two were simply [[magic (illusion)|magicians]], using common sleight of hand to fool the researchers. In July 1981 Phillips asked Randi to join him in designing some of the experiments. Randi then replied with a videotape showing him duplicating spoon and key bending, using the exact methods the two were using at the lab. Phillips agreed to show this video at the upcoming meeting.

Randi then started to leak stories that the two were a plant of his, which reached the lab a week later and were considered to be a joke. The story had been widely circulated by the time the meeting was held the next month. Reactions were varied; some thought it was simply a lie, others that Randi was pulling off a hoax, and still others concluded the entire experiment was dreamed up as a conspiracy by Randi and Phillips to discredit the field.

Upon returning from the meeting, Phillips immediately changed the test protocols. The two found that they were no longer able to fool the experimenters so easily, and in most cases, not at all. During this time the lab started releasing additional reports that seriously toned down the success rate. Apparently they were beginning to understand what was going on.

However, at this point Shaw and Edwards were so famous that they were asked to travel widely and present their powers. Many other PSI investigators interviewed the two and gave glowing reviews, thus tainting themselves in the eventual aftermath.

Randi decided to finally end the project, and announced the entire affair in [[Discover Magazine|''Discover'' magazine]]. The resulting crash of the parapsychology field was immediate and deep; many of the researchers who endorsed Shaw and Edwards after the August meeting were now burned in the process. One went so far as to claim that the boys really did have psychic powers, and that they were now lying about being magicians. Although the McDonnell Lab was by this time running considerably better experiments, the bad press was so widespread it was shut down.

The ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]'' (published by the [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]]) (at the time known as CSICOP, the Committee for Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal) had revealed that Steve Shaw was a fake psychic in their Fall 1980 issue. At the time neither the authors (McBurney and Greenberg) nor the editor ([[Kendrick Frazier]]) knew that Shaw was part of Project Alpha. Clearly the parapsychology researchers either didn't read the article or didn't believe it.  In addition, rumors that the psychics were fake reached the researchers, but they didn't believe them {{Harvcol|Gardner|1984|}}.

The complaint of PSI investigators for years had been that they did not have enough funding for their experiments. However, in Randi's opinion it was not funding, but the experimenters that were the problem. With $500,000 from McDonnell, Randi felt that lack of funding could no longer be blamed for any failure. Randi's purpose was to show that no matter how much money was spent, there would still be no reliable results. Some within the parapsychology community were outraged, with Berthold Schwarz of the McDonnell Laboratory declaring "Randi has set parapsychology back 100 years!" But Randi reports that other parapsychology researchers  have contacted him with praise, describing the project as "splendid and deserved," "an important sanitary service," "commendable," and "long-needed."
