'''USS ''Macon'' (ZRS-5)''' was a rigid [[airship]] built and operated by the [[United States Navy]] for [[Reconnaissance|scouting]] and served as a [[Airborne aircraft carrier|"flying aircraft carrier"]], designed to carry biplane [[parasite aircraft]], five single-seat [[Curtiss F9C Sparrowhawk]] for scouting or two-seat [[Fleet Model 1|Fleet N2Y-1]] for training. In service for less than two years, in 1935 ''Macon'' was damaged in a storm and lost off [[California|California's]] [[Big Sur]] coast, though most of the crew were saved. The wreckage is listed as '''USS ''Macon'' Airship Remains''' on the U.S. [[National Register of Historic Places]].

Less than {{convert|20|ft|m|abbr=on}} shorter than [[LZ 129 Hindenburg|''Hindenburg'']], both the ''Macon'' and "[[sister ship]]" [[USS Akron (ZRS-4)|USS ''Akron'' (ZRS-4)]] were among the largest flying objects in the world in terms of length and volume. Although the hydrogen-filled ''Hindenburg'' was longer, the two sisters still hold the world record for [[helium]]-filled airships.{{cn|date=January 2014}}

==Construction and commissioning==
USS ''Macon'' was built at the [[Goodyear Airdock]] in [[Springfield Township, Summit County, Ohio|Springfield Township, Ohio]] by the [[Goodyear Aerospace|Goodyear-Zeppelin Corporation]].<ref name=brochure>{{cite web | last = [[Akron-Summit County Public Library]] | first = [http://www.summitmemory.org/index.php Summit Memory] | title = Goodyear-Zeppelin Corporation, Facts About the World's Largest Airship Factory & Dock | url = http://www.summitmemory.org/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/fulton&CISOPTR=97&CISOSHOW=93 | accessdate = 2008-11-15 }}</ref> Because this was by far the biggest airship ever to be built in America, a team of experienced German airship engineers<U+2014>led by Chief Designer [[Karl Arnstein]]<U+2014>instructed and supported design and construction of both [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] airships ''Akron'' and ''Macon''.<ref>{{cite web | last = [[Akron-Summit County Public Library]] | first = [http://www.summitmemory.org/index.php Summit Memory] | title = Dr. Karl Arnstein photo and biography | url = http://www.summitmemory.org/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/fulton&CISOPTR=170&CISOBOX=1&REC=3 | accessdate = 2008-11-15}}</ref>

The airship was named after the city of [[Macon, Georgia]], which was the largest city in the [[Congressional district#United States|Congressional district]] of [[Carl Vinson|Representative Carl Vinson]],  then the chairman of the [[U.S. House of Representatives|House of Representative]]'s [[United States House Committee on Armed Services#History|Committee on Naval Affairs]].<ref name=Moffett>{{cite web | last = [http://www.moffettfieldmuseum.org Moffett Field Museum] | first = Moffett Field Historical Society | title = U.S.S. Macon | url = http://www.moffettfieldmuseum.org/history.html#macon | accessdate = 2008-11-13 }}</ref>

''Macon'' was [[Ship naming and launching|christened]] on 11 March 1933 by Jeanette Whitton Moffett, wife of [[Rear Admiral]] [[William A. Moffett]], Chief of the U.S. Navy's [[Bureau of Aeronautics]].<ref>{{cite web | last = [[Akron-Summit County Public Library]] | first = [http://www.summitmemory.org/index.php Summit Memory] | title = USS Macon christening photograph | url = http://www.summitmemory.org/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/fulton&CISOPTR=182&CISOBOX=1&REC=4
| accessdate = 2008-11-15 }}</ref> The airship first flew one month later, shortly after the tragic loss of the ''Akron''. ''Macon'' was commissioned on 23 June 1933, with Commander [[Alger H. Dresel]] in command.

''Macon'' had a structured [[duralumin]]um [[wikt:hull|hull]] with three interior [[keel]]s.<ref name=monterey>{{cite web | last = [http://montereybay.noaa.gov/welcome.html Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary] | first = [http://montereybay.noaa.gov/research/macon/welcome.html Submerged Maritime Heritage Resource: USS Macon] | title = The Marvel of the USS Macon | url = http://montereybay.noaa.gov/research/macon/macon.html | accessdate = 2008-11-15 }}</ref> The airship was kept aloft by 12 [[helium]]-filled gas cells made from [[gelatin]]-[[latex]] fabric. Inside the hull, the ship had eight German-made [[Maybach]] 12-[[Cylinder (engine)|cylinder]], {{convert|560|hp|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} [[Petrol engine|gasoline-powered engines]] that drove outside [[propeller]]s.<ref name=Moffett/>  The propellers could be rotated down or backwards, providing an early form of [[thrust vectoring]] to control the ship during takeoff and landings.  The hull's prominent vertical "slots" were meant to capture the motors' exhaust gas and allow the water vapor therein to condense out for reuse as [[Buoyancy compensator (aviation)|buoyancy compensation]] ballast water (since in-flight fuel consumption continuously lightens an airship's weight).

The ''Macon'' first docked an aircraft on 6 July 1933 during trial flights out of [[Lakehurst, New Jersey]]. The planes were stored in bays inside the hull and were launched and retrieved using a [[Parasite aircraft|trapeze]].

==Early service history==
On 24 June 1933 ''Macon'' left Goodyear's field for [[Naval Air Station]] (NAS) Lakehurst, N.J., where the new airship was based for the summer while undergoing a series of training flights before departing the East Coast on 12 October on a transcontinental flight to the scout ship's permanent homebase at NAS Sunnyvale (now [[Moffett Federal Airfield]]) near [[San Francisco]] in [[Santa Clara County, California]].<ref>"Macon Comes East; Her Voyage Calm: New Queen of Navy's Air Fleet Docked at Lakehurst After Smooth Flight from Ohio". The New York Times, 25 June 1933, p. 3</ref><ref>"Macon Takes Off for Flight to the West: Dirigible Leaves Lakehurst for Its Permanent Station at Sunnyvale, Calif" The New York Times, 13 October 1933, P. 21</ref>

The ''Macon'' had a far more productive career than the ''Akron'', which crashed  on 4 April 1933. The commanders of the ''Macon'' developed the doctrine and techniques of using her on-board aircraft for scouting while the airship remained out of sight of the opposing forces during exercises.<ref>Robinson 1973, p.242.</ref> The ''Macon'' participated in several fleet exercises, though the men who framed and conducted the exercises lacked an understanding of the airship's capabilities and weaknesses.<ref>Robinson 1973, p.243.</ref> It became standard practice to remove the landing gear of the Sparrowhawks while aboard the airship and then replace it with a fuel tank, thus giving the aircraft 30 percent more range.<ref>Robinson 1973, p.244.</ref>

In June, 1934, [[Lieutenant Commander]] Herbert V. Wiley took command of the airship, and shortly afterwards he surprised President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] (and the Navy) when the ''Macon'' searched for and located  the [[heavy cruiser]] {{USS|Houston|CA-30|2}}, which was then carrying the president back from a trip to Hawaii. Newspapers were dropped to the President on the ship, and the following communications were sent back to the airship: "from ''Houston'': 1519 The President compliments you and your planes on your fine performance and excellent navigation 1210 and 1519 Well Done and thank you for the papers the President 1245."

The commander of the Fleet, Admiral [[Joseph M. Reeves]], was upset about the matter: but the Commander of the Bureau of Aviation, Admiral [[Ernest J. King]]<ref>the [[Chief of Naval Operations]] during [[World War II]],</ref> was not. Wiley, one of only three survivors of the crash of the ''Akron'', was soon promoted to [[commander]], served as the captain of the battleship {{USS|West Virginia|BB-48|2}} in the final two years of [[World War II]], and then retired from the Navy in 1947 as a [[rear admiral]].

==Leading up to the crash==
[[Image:Zeppelin.jpg|300px|thumb|USS ''Macon'' over [[Moffett Federal Airfield|Moffett Field]]]]
During a crossing of the continent, ''Macon'' was forced to climb to {{convert|6000|ft|m|abbr=on}} to clear mountains in [[Arizona]]. As the ship's pressure height (the height at which the gas cells would start to leak and eventually rupture due to pressure difference) was less than {{convert|3000|ft|m|abbr=on}}, a large amount of helium was vented in reaching this altitude. To compensate for the loss of lift, {{convert|9000|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of ballast and {{convert|7000|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of fuel had to be dumped. ''Macon'' was being flown {{convert|15000|lb|kg|abbr=on}} "heavy" and was operating at full power not only in order to have sufficient dynamic lift, but also to have enough control to fly in the severe turbulence through a mountain pass near [[Van Horn, Texas]]. Following a severe drop, a diagonal girder in ring 17.5, which supported the forward fin attachment points, failed. Rapid damage control by Chief Boatswain's Mate Robert Davis repaired the girders before further failures could occur. ''Macon'' completed the journey safely but the buckled ring and all four tailfins were judged to be in need of strengthening. The appropriate girders adjacent to the horizontal and lower fins were repaired, but the repairs to the girders on either side of the top fin were delayed until the next scheduled overhaul, when the adjacent gas cells could be deflated.

==Disaster==
On 12 February 1935 the repair process was still incomplete when, returning to Sunnyvale from fleet maneuvers, ''Macon'' ran into a storm off [[Point Sur]], [[California]]. During the storm, the ship was caught in a [[wind shear]] which caused [[structural failure]] of the unstrengthened ring (17.5) to which the upper tailfin was attached. The fin failed to the side and was carried away. Pieces of structure punctured the rear gas cells and caused gas leakage. Acting rapidly and on fragmentary information an immediate and massive discharge of ballast was ordered. Control was lost and, tail heavy and with engines running full speed ahead, ''Macon'' rose past the pressure height of {{convert|2800|ft|m|abbr=on}}, and kept rising until enough helium was vented to cancel the lift, reaching an altitude of {{convert|4850|ft|m|abbr=on}}.<ref>Robinson 1973, p.246.</ref> It took 20&nbsp;minutes to descend and, settling gently into the sea, ''Macon'' sank off [[Monterey Bay]]. Only two of the 76 crew members were lost thanks to the warm conditions and the introduction of life jackets and inflatable rafts after the ''Akron'' tragedy. Radioman 1st Class Ernest Edwin Dailey jumped ship while still too high above the ocean surface to survive the fall and Mess Attendant 1st Class Florentino Edquiba drowned while swimming back into the wreckage to try to retrieve personal belongings. An officer was rescued when Commander Wiley swam to his aid, an action for which he was later decorated.<ref>[http://www.usswestvirginia.org/veterans/personalpage.php?id=3433 Herbert V. Wiley, Captain USN, USS West Virginia, 1944-1945]</ref>

The cause of the loss was operator error following the structural failure and loss of the fin. Had the ship not been driven over pressure height (where the cells were expanded fully and lifting gas released) ''Macon'' could have made it back to [[Moffett Federal Airfield|Moffett Field]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} Four Sparrowhawks carried aboard were lost with the airship.

''Macon'', having completed 50 flights since being commissioned, was stricken from the Navy list on 26 February 1935. Subsequent airships for Navy use were of a [[Non-rigid airship|nonrigid design]].

A depiction of the crash by artist [[Noel Sickles]] was the first piece of art sent over the wire by the Associated Press.

==Wreck site exploration==

The [[Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute]] (MBARI) succeeded in locating and surveying the debris field of ''Macon'' in February 1991, and was able to recover some artifacts.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.mbari.org/itd/retrospective/full_text.pdf | title = MBARI's First Decade: A Retrospective | publisher = [[Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute]] |date=c. 1997 | accessdate = 2006-10-04 | format = PDF }} (page 11)</ref> The exploration included sonar, video, and still camera data, as well as some  recovery of parts.

In May 2005, MBARI returned to the site as part of a year-long research project to identify archeological resources in the bay. Side-scan sonar was used to survey the site.

===2006 expedition===
A more complete return, including exploration with [[remotely operated vehicle]]s and involving researchers from MBARI, [[Stanford University]], and the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]'s Office of National Marine Sanctuaries, took place in September 2006.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.theksbwchannel.com/news/9844035/detail.html | title = Expedition To Probe Sunken Airship

The 2006 expedition was a success, and revealed a number of new surprises and changes since the last visit, ~15&nbsp;years previously. High-definition video and more than 10,000 new images were captured, which were assembled into a navigation-grade [[photomosaic]] of the wreck.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.theksbwchannel.com/news/9949569/detail.html | title = USS Macon Exploration Findings Unveiled | publisher = [[KSBW-TV]] | date = 27 September 2006 | accessdate = 2006-10-04}} (includes slideshow)</ref>

{{quote |When the USS ''Macon'' was christened on 11 March 1933 the rigid airship was the most sophisticated of the Navy<U+2019>s lighter-than-air (LTA) fleet. The ''Macon'' exhibited the highest expression of naval LTA technology during the ship's short career. At 785 feet in length, the airship<U+2019>s size captured American fascination during flyovers of U.S. communities as chronicled in numerous advertisements, articles, and newsreels. The dramatic loss of the ''Macon'' and sister ship {{USS|Akron|ZRS-4|2}} within two years of each other contributed to the cancellation of the Navy<U+2019>s rigid airship program. The archeological remains of the USS ''Macon'' lie off California<U+2019>s Big Sur coast in NOAA<U+2019>s [[Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary]]. The site also contains the remains of four of the airship<U+2019>s squadron of small Curtiss [[F9C Sparrowhawk]] scout aircraft which the ''Macon'' carried in an internal hangar bay.}}
