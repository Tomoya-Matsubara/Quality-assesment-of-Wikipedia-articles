The '''Marksville culture''' was  an [[archaeological culture]] in the lower  [[Lower Mississippi]] valley, [[Yazoo River|Yazoo]] valley, and [[Tensas River|Tensas]] valley areas of [[Louisiana]], [[Mississippi]], [[Missouri]], [[Arkansas]]<ref name=Prehistory>{{Cite web| url =http://www.crt.state.la.us/archaeology/laprehis/marca.htm| title=Louisiana Prehistory-Marksville, Troyville-Coles Creek, and Caddo|accessed-2010=02-04}}</ref> and extended eastward along the Gulf Coast to the [[Mobile Bay]] area,<ref name=Kisatchie>{{Cite web| url=http://www.fs.fed.us/r8/kisatchie/resources/heritage-pages/history.htm|title=Kisatchie National Forest|accessed-2010=02-04}}</ref> from 100 BCE to 400 CE. This culture takes its name from the [[Marksville Prehistoric Indian Site]] in [[Avoyelles Parish, Louisiana]]. Marksville Culture was contemporaneous with the [[Hopewell tradition|Hopewell cultures]] of [[Ohio]] and [[Illinois]]. It evolved from the earlier [[Tchefuncte site#Tchefuncte culture|Tchefuncte culture]] and into the [[Baytown culture]] and later the [[Coles Creek culture|Coles Creek]] and [[Plum Bayou culture|Plum Bayou]] cultures. It is considered ancestral to the [[Natchez people|Natchez]] and [[Taensa]] Peoples.<ref name="The Plaquemine Culture, A.D 1000">{{cite web | url = http://bcn.boulder.co.us/environment/cacv/cacvbrvl.htm| title = The Plaquemine Culture, A.D 1000|accessdate = 2008-09-08 }}</ref>

==Description==

The Hopewell tradition was a widely dispersed set of related populations, which were connected by a common network of trade routes,<ref name="Price">{{cite book | author= Douglas T. Price, and Gary M. Feinman | year= 2008 | title= Images of the Past, 5th edition | pages= 274<U+2013>277 | location= New York | publisher=McGraw-Hill | isbn= 978-0-07-340520-9}}</ref> known as the [[Hopewell Exchange System]]. The Marksville culture was a southern manifestation of this network. Settlements were large and usually located on terraces of major streams. Evidence from excavations of burial mounds from this period suggest they were constructed for persons of high social status, and contained grave goods of imported exotic materials such as [[copper]] panpipes, earspools, bracelets and beads, rare minerals, stone platform pipes, [[mica]] figurines, marine shells, freshwater pearls, and [[Greenstone (archaeology)|greenstone]] celts.<ref>{{Cite web| url=http://www.nps.gov/history/seac/outline/04-woodland/index-2.htm|title=Southeastern Prehistory-Middle Woodland Period|accessed-2010=02-04}}</ref> The pipes had flat bases with a hole for a stem, and a bowl in the center. Animal figurines on the platform aren't unusual, with the bowl being located in the animal's back.<ref name=Kisatchie/> The high status leaders organized community life, and officiated at burial ceremonies, an important part of the Marksville Culture. The mounds were constructed in stages over many years, with the first stage being a flat, low platform. The ceremonies may have been held years apart and those who died between ceremonies were temporarily stored in other locations, then gathered up and buried together.<ref name=Prehistory/>

==Pottery==

Although made from local clay, Marksville pottery was similar in design and decoration to pottery found in Illinois and Ohio. A typical vessel was three to five inches tall and three to seven inches in diameter and often decorated with geometric and effigy designs, usually stylized birds. This decorated pottery was made primarily for ceremonial uses, with other plainer utilitarian ware for daily use.<ref name=Kisatchie/>

==Chronology==
The Marksville culture was preceded by the [[Tchefuncte site#Tchefuncte culture|Tchefuncte culture]], and was eventually succeeded by the [[Baytown culture]].
