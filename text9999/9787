==History==

===Etymology===
For the origin of the name "Kars", some sources claim it to be derived from the [[Georgian language|Georgian]] word <U+10D9><U+10D0><U+10E0><U+10D8> (''kari''), meaning "the gate"<ref name="trudy">{{cite book |title=International Dictionary of Historic Places: Southern Europe |last=Ring |first=Trudy |authorlink= |coauthors=Salkin, Robert M.; La Boda, Sharon |year=1996 |publisher=Taylor & Francis |isbn=1-884964-02-8|page=357|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=74JI2UlcU8AC&pg=PA357}}</ref> while other sources claim it is from the Armenian word <U+0570><U+0561><U+0580><U+057D> (''hars'') which is a [[Folk etymology|folk etymological]] word for ''bride'', or rather from <U+056F><U+0561><U+057C><U+0578><U+0582><U+0581> <U+0562><U+0565><U+0580><U+0564> (''ka<U+1E5B>uts berd''), "Ka<U+1E5B>uts Fortress".<ref>{{cite book |title=Placenames of the World |last=Room |first=Adrian |authorlink= |year=2003 |publisher=McFarland |location= |isbn=0-7864-1814-1 |page=178}}</ref> The Georgian etymology, along with a Turkish one offered by M. Fahrettin K<U+0131>rz<U+0131>o<U+011F>lu (that the name came from the "Karsak", a Turkish tribe), has been criticized by some scholars.<ref>[[Vasily Bartold|Bartold, Vasily]]-[C. J. Heywood]. "Kars." [[Encyclopedia of Islam]], 2nd ed. Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1997, vol. iv, p. 669.</ref>

===Medieval period===
[[File:Armenian Cathedral of Kars.png|thumb|260px|The 10th-century [[Cathedral of Kars|Armenian Church of the Holy Apostles]], as seen in a photo taken in the late 19th century.]]

Little is known of the early history of Kars beyond the fact that it had its own dynasty of Armenian rulers and was the capital of a region known as [[Vanand]]. As Chorzene, the town appears in Roman historiography ([[Strabo]]) as part of [[Roman Armenia|ancient Armenia]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0239:book=11:chapter=14&highlight=chorzene#note-link4 | title=Geography Stabo - Book XI - Chapter XIV | accessdate=2011-05-31 | author=Strabo}}</ref> Medieval Armenian historians referred to the city by a variety of names, including "Karuts' K'aghak'" (Kars city), "Karuts' Berd", "Amrots'n Karuts'" (both meaning Kars Fortress) and "Amurn Karuts'" (Impenetrable Kars).<ref name="SAE"/> At some point in the ninth century (at least by 888) it became part of the territory of the [[Bagratuni Kingdom of Armenia|Armenian Bagratunis]]. Kars was the [[historic capitals of Armenia|capital]] of [[Bagratid Kingdom of Armenia]] between 928 and 961.<ref name="Grove Encyclopedia"/> During this period the town's cathedral, later known as the [[Cathedral of Kars|Church of the Holy Apostles]], was built.<ref>{{hy icon}} [[Varazdat Harutyunyan|Harutyunyan, Varazdat M.]] "<U+0543><U+0561><U+0580><U+057F><U+0561><U+0580><U+0561><U+057A><U+0565><U+057F><U+0578><U+0582><U+0569><U+0575><U+0578><U+0582><U+0576>" [Architecture] in ''<U+0540><U+0561><U+0575> <U+053A><U+0578><U+0572><U+0578><U+057E><U+0580><U+0564><U+056B> <U+054A><U+0561><U+057F><U+0574><U+0578><U+0582><U+0569><U+0575><U+0578><U+0582><U+0576>'' [History of the Armenian People], ed. [[Tsatur Aghayan]] et al. Yerevan: Armenian Academy of Sciences, 1976, vol. 3, pp.&nbsp;374<U+2013>375.</ref>

In 963, shortly after the Bagratuni seat was transferred to [[Ani]], Kars became the capital of a separate independent kingdom, again called Vanand. The extent of its actual independence from the Kingdom of Ani is uncertain: it was always in the possession of the relatives of the rulers of Ani, and, after Ani's capture by the [[Byzantine Empire]] in 1045, the Bagratuni title "King of Kings" held by the ruler of Ani was transferred to the ruler of Kars. In 1064, just after the capture of Ani by [[Alp Arslan]] (King of the [[Seljuk Turks]]), the Armenian king of Kars, Gagik-Abas, paid homage to the victorious Turks, so that they would not lay siege to his city. In 1065 Gagik-Abas ceded control of Kars to the Byzantine Empire, but soon after Kars was taken by the Seljuk Turks.<ref name="SAE"/>

In 1206/07 the city was captured by the [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]ns and given to the same [[Zakarid-Mxargrzeli|Zakarid]] family who ruled Ani. They retained control of Kars until the late 1230s, after which it had Turkish rulers. In 1387 the city surrendered to [[Timur]] (Tamerlane) and its fortifications were damaged. [[Anatolian beyliks]] followed until 1534, when the Ottoman army captured the city. The fortifications of the city were rebuilt by the Ottoman Sultan [[Murad III]] and were strong enough to withstand a siege by [[Nadir Shah]] of [[Persian Empire|Persia]], in 1731. It became the head of a [[sanjak]] in the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Erzurum Vilayet]].

===Russian administration===
{{see also|Kars Oblast}}
[[File:Kars 1828.jpg|thumb|250px|The 1828 Russian siege of Kars (painter [[January Suchodolski]]).]]
In 1807 Kars successfully resisted an attack by the [[Russian Empire]]. After another siege in 1828 the city was surrendered on June 23, 1828 to the Russian general Count [[Ivan Paskevich]], 11,000 men becoming [[prisoners of war]]. Although it later returned to Ottoman control, the new border between the Ottoman Empire and Russia was now much closer to Kars. During the [[Crimean War]] an Ottoman garrison led by British officers including General [[William Fenwick Williams]] kept the Russians at bay during a [[Siege of Kars|protracted siege]]; but after the garrison had been devastated by cholera and food supplies had depleted, the town was [[Siege of Kars|surrendered]] to [[Nikolay Muravyov-Karsky|General Mouravieff]] in November 1855.

The fortress was again stormed by the Russians in the [[Battle of Kars]] during the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1877-78]] under generals [[Mikhail Tarielovich Loris-Melikov|Loris-Melikov]] and [[Lazarev Ivan Davidovich|Ivan Lazarev]]. Following the war, Kars was transferred to [[Russian Empire|Russia]] by the [[Treaty of San Stefano]]. Kars became the capital of the [[Kars Oblast]] (province), comprising the districts of Kars, [[Ardahan]], [[Ka<U+011F><U+0131>zman|Kaghisman]], and [[Oltu]].

From 1878 to 1881 more than 82,000 Muslims from formerly Ottoman-controlled territory migrated to the Ottoman Empire. Among those there were more than 11,000 people from the city of Kars. At the same time, many [[Armenians]] and [[Pontic Greeks]] (here usually called [[Caucasus Greeks]]) migrated to the region from the Ottoman Empire and other regions of Transcaucasia. According to the Russian census data, by 1897 [[Armenians]] formed 49.7%, [[Russians]] 26.3%, [[Caucasus Greeks]] 11.7%, [[Poles]] 5.3% and Turks 3.8%.<ref name="1897 census"/>

===World War I===
[[File:Armenians fleeing Kars.jpg|thumb|250px|Armenian civilians fleeing Kars after its capture by [[K<U+00E2>z<U+0131>m Karabekir]]'s forces.]]
In the First World War, the city was one of the main objectives of the Ottoman army during the lost [[Battle of Sarikamish]] in the [[Caucasus Campaign]]. Russia ceded Kars, [[Ardahan]] and [[Batum]] to the Ottoman Empire under the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] on March 3, 1918. However, by then Kars was under the effective control of Armenian and non-Bolshevik Russian forces. The Ottoman Empire captured Kars on April 25, 1918, but under the [[Armistice of Mudros]] (October 1918) was required to withdraw to the pre-war frontier. The Ottomans refused to relinquish Kars; its military governor instead established a government, the [[Provisional National Government of the Southwestern Caucasus]], led by Fahrettin Pirioglu, that claimed Turkish sovereignty over Kars and Turkish-speaking regions as far as Batumi and [[Gyumri|Alexandropol]] (Gyumri). Much of the region fell under the administrative control of [[Democratic Republic of Armenia|Armenia]] in January 1919 but the pro-Turkish government remained in the city until a joint operation launched by British and Armenian troops dissolved it on April 19, 1919, arresting its leaders and sending them to [[Malta exiles|Malta]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Hovannisian|first=Richard G.|authorlink=Richard G.

Skirmishes between the [[Turkish revolutionaries]] and Armenian border troops in [[Olti]] took place during the summer of 1920.

After the [[Bolshevik]] advance into Armenia, the Treaty of Alexandropol was superseded by the [[Treaty of Kars]] (October 23, 1921), signed between Turkey and the [[Soviet Union]]. The treaty allowed for Soviet annexation of [[Adjara]] in exchange for Turkish control of the regions of [[Kars Province|Kars]], [[I<U+011F>d<U+0131>r Province|Igdir]], and [[Ardahan Province|Ardahan]]. The Treaty of Kars established peaceful relations between the two nations, but as early as 1939, some British diplomats noted{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} indications that the Soviet Union was not satisfied with the established border.

===Recent history===
After World War II, the Soviet Union attempted to annul the Kars treaty and regain the Kars region and the adjoining region of [[Ardahan]]. On June 7, 1945, Soviet Foreign Minister [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] told the Turkish ambassador to Moscow [[Selim Sarper]] that the regions should be returned to the [[Soviet Union]], on behalf of the Georgian and Armenian republics.  Turkey found itself in a difficult position: it wanted good relations with the Soviet Union, but at the same time they refused to give up the territories. Turkey itself was in no condition to fight a war with the Soviet Union, which had emerged as a superpower after the second world war. By the autumn of 1945, Soviet troops in the Caucasus were ordered to prepare for a possible invasion of Turkey. Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] objected to these territorial claims, while [[President of the United States|President]] [[Harry Truman]] initially felt that the matter should not concern other parties. With the onset of the [[Cold War]], however, the United States came to see Turkey as usefully ally against Soviet expansion and began to support it financially and militarily. By 1948 the Soviet Union dropped its clams to Kars and the other regions.<ref>Krikorian, Robert O.

== Climate ==
Kars has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[K<U+00F6>ppen climate classification]]: ''Dfb''), with a significant difference between summer and winter temperatures, as well as night and day temperatures, due to its location away from large bodies of water, its high elevation and relatively high latitude. Summers are generally brief and warm with cool nights. The average high temperature in August is {{convert|26|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F|lk=on|abbr=on}}. Winters are very cold. The average low January temperature is {{convert|-16|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F|lk=on|abbr=on}}. However, temperatures can plummet to {{convert|-35|C|1}} during the winter months. It snows a lot in winter, staying for an average of four months in the city. Due to its geographic location of the city in the province, it has a slightly milder climate compared to the surrounding region. Some hills and peaks in the province, especially around the [[Sar<U+0131>kam<U+0131><U+015F>]] region, are [[subarctic]] ([[K<U+00F6>ppen climate classification]] ''Dfc'') due to the higher elevation of the region. Both the summers and winters are colder in this area, with winter temperatures reaching {{convert|-40|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F|lk=on|abbr=on}} more regularly.

== Education ==
There are 48 high schools in Kars.<ref>http://www.sinavonline.net/oss/liseler_kars.asp</ref><ref>http://kars.meb.gov.tr/www/liseler/icerik/106</ref> Kars hosts the [[Kafkas University]], which was established in 1992.

== Transport ==
Kars is served by a main highway from Erzurum, and lesser roads run north to Ardahan and south to Igdir. The town has an airport, with daily direct flights to Ankara and Istanbul. Kars is served by [[Kars Railway Station|a station]] on the [[Turkish Railways]] (TCDD) that links it to Erzurum. This line was originally laid when Kars was within the Russian Empire and connected the city to nearby [[Gyumri|Alexandropol]] and [[Tiflis]], with a wartime, narrow-gauge extension running to Erzurum. Turkey's border crossings with Armenia, including the rail link, the [[Kars-Gyumri-Tbilisi railway]], have been closed since 1993. Construction on a new line, the [[Kars<U+2013>Tbilisi<U+2013>Baku railway]], intended to connect Turkey with [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Azerbaijan]], began in 2010 and is scheduled for completion by 2012. The line will connect Kars to [[Akhalkalaki]] in Georgia, from where trains will continue to [[Tbilisi]], and [[Baku]] in [[Azerbaijan]].<ref>[[Railway Gazette International]] February 2009 p54 with map</ref>

==Places of interest==

===Kars Citadel===
[[File:Kars kalesi.jpg|thumb|Kars Citadel]]
The [[Castle of Kars]]  ({{lang-tr|Kars Kalesi}}), also known as the [[Citadel]], sits at the top a rocky hill overlooking Kars. Its walls date back to the [[Bagratuni Dynasty|Bagratuni]] Armenian period (there is surviving masonry on the north side of the castle) but it probably took on its present form during the thirteenth century when Kars was ruled by the [[Zak'arid]] dynasty.

The walls bear crosses in several places, including a  [[khachkar]] with a building inscription in Armenian on the easternmost tower, so the much repeated statement that Kars castle was built by [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Sultan]] [[Murad III]] during the war with [[Persian Empire|Persia]], at the close of the sixteenth century, is inaccurate. However, Murad probably did reconstruct much of the city walls (they are similar to those that the Ottoman army constructed at [[Ardahan]]).

By the nineteenth century the citadel had lost most of its defensive purpose and a series of outer fortresses and defensive works were constructed to encircle Kars - this new defensive system proved particularly notable during the [[Siege of Kars]] in 1855.

Below the castle is an Armenian church known as Surb Arak'elots, the [[Cathedral of Kars|Church of the Holy Apostles]]. Built in the 930s, it has a [[tetraconch]] plan (a square with four semicircular apses) surmounted by a spherical dome on a cylindrical drum. On the exterior, the drum of contains [[bas-relief]] depictions of twelve figures, usually interpreted as representing the Twelve Apostles. The dome has a conical roof. The church was converted to a mosque in 1579, and then converted into a Russian Orthodox church in the 1880s. The Russian people constructed porches in front of the church's 3 entrances, and an elaborate belltower (now demolished) next to the church. The church was used as a warehouse from the 1930s, and it housed a small museum from 1963 until the late 1970s. Then the building was left to itself for about two decades, until it was converted into a mosque in 1993. In the same district of Kars are two other ruined Armenian churches. A Russian church from the 1900s was converted to a mosque in the 1980s after serving as a school gymnasium.<ref>"[http://www.virtualani.org/karscathedral/index.htm THE CATHEDRAL OF KARS: Holy Apostles Church (Surb Arak'elots)]." VirtualANI. December 7, 2000.</ref>

The "Tashk<U+00F6>pr<U+00FC>" (Stone Bridge) is a bridge over the Kars river, built in 1725. Close to the bridge are three old bath-houses, none of them operating any longer.

As a settlement at the juncture of [[Culture of Armenia|Armenian]], [[Culture of Turkey|Turkish]], [[Culture of Georgia (country)|Georgian]], [[Kurdish culture|Kurdish]] and [[Culture of Russia|Russian]] cultures, the buildings of Kars come in a variety of architectural styles. Most central buildings and houses are identical in the architercutal sense to those of central Gyumri in Armenia.  [[Orhan Pamuk]] in the novel ''[[Snow (Pamuk novel)|Snow]]'', which takes place in Kars, makes repeated references to "the Russian houses", built "in a [[Balts|Baltic]] style", whose like cannot be seen anywhere else in Turkey, and deplores the deteriorating condition of these houses.
