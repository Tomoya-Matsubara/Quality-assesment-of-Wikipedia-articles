[[File:Manuel de Dios Uranue Triangle jeh.jpg|left|thumb|300px|The Manuel de Dios Unanue Triangle, which is a public park located in Woodside, Queens, New York City, was dedicated to the journalist for his contributions.]]
Manuel de Dios Unanue was born in [[Camaguey]], Cuba, 4 January 1943.<ref name=findagrave /><ref name=nydailynews1999 /> Along with his family, de Dios went into voluntary exile from Castro<U+2019>s Cuba, settling first in [[Spain]], before emigrating to [[Puerto Rico]] in 1967.<ref name=findagrave /> De Dios received a M.S. in Criminology from the [[Inter-American University]] in Puerto Rico before relocating to New York City in 1973.<ref name=findagrave /><ref name=nyc /><ref name=PeopleMagazine /> After being gunned down on the evening of 11 March 1992, de Dios was laid to rest 14 March 1992, in [[Bayamon, Puerto Rico|Bayamon]], Puerto Rico. He was survived by his mother, three sisters, and brother, as well as his girlfriend and business partner Vicky Sanchez and their two year-old daughter Melody.<ref name=PeopleMagazine />

== Career ==
After arriving in New York City in 1973, de Dios  went to work for the city<U+2019>s Hispanic Criminal Justice Task Force,<ref name=findagrave /><ref name=nyc /><ref name=PeopleMagazine /> which was chaired by [[Marco Antonio Rigau]]. In 1977, he joined the staff of ''El Diario-La Prensa'', New York City<U+2019>s largest Spanish-language daily newspaper, first as a reporter, later as a columnist, then as editor-in-chief from 1984-1989.<ref name=findagrave /><ref name=nyc /><ref name=PeopleMagazine /> According to de Dios, he fell out of favor with his bosses at the newspaper in 1989 because of his unflattering coverage of then New York City Mayor [[Ed Koch]] and as a result he was let go.<ref name=nydailynews1999 /> After leaving ''El Diario-La Prensa'', de Dios hosted a radio show called "What Others Try To Silence," and he publicized alleged drug traffickers<U+2019> names on the air.<ref name=nydailynews1999 /> In 1988, de Dios published a book, ''The Secrets of the Medellin Cartel.''<ref name=findagrave /><ref name=PeopleMagazine /> He was also the founding editor of two magazines, ''Cambio XXI,'' and ''Crimen,'' which he published up to the time of his death, and in them he exposed the names of alleged drug dealers and published photos of their activities.<ref name=nyc /><ref name=PeopleMagazine /><ref name=CPJ1992>{{cite web|url=http://cpj.org/killed/1992/manuel-de-dios-unanue.php |title=Manuel de Dios Unanue - Journalists Killed |publisher=Committee to Protect Journalists |date=1992-03-11 |accessdate=2012-11-02}}</ref><ref name=nytimes1994>{{cite news|first=Joseph P.|last=Fried |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/10/nyregion/youth-guilty-in-the-slaying-of-an-editor.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm |title=Youth Guilty In the Slaying Of an Editor |publisher=New York Times |date=1994-03-10 |accessdate=2012-09-23}}</ref><ref name=nytimes1996>{{cite news|first=Joseph P.|last=Fried |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/11/nyregion/man-is-sentenced-to-18-years-in-killing-of-anti-drug-writer.html |title=Man Is Sentenced to 18 Years In Killing of Anti-Drug Writer |publisher=New York Times |date=1996-05-11 |accessdate=2012-09-23}}</ref> "He was absolutely the most prominent American journalist to expose the cartels," said Rossana Rosado, ''El Diario-La Prensa<U+2019>s'' city editor.<ref name=PeopleMagazine />

}}On 5 May 1993, federal prosecutors in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn charged John Mena, age 24, with arranging de Dios<U+2019> murder on behalf of the Cali cartel and also charged Alejandro Wilson Mejia-Velez, age 18, with being the shooter. At a news conference afterward, government officials stressed that the murder investigation had been given the same attention as one that might involve the murder of a police officer. "Any murder is obviously a heinous crime, but when the victim is murdered not for revenge or out of passion but because he has reported on the truth as he has found it," said U.S. Attorney [[Mary Jo White]] at the same news conference, "we all are very much the victims here."<ref name=baltimoresun1993>{{cite web|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1993-05-11/news/1993131217_1_cali-cartel-dios-killers |title=Manuel De Dios Unanue &#124; 2 indicted in N.Y. journalist's killing Drug cartel said to order slaying |publisher=Baltimore Sun |date=1993-05-11 |accessdate=2012-09-23}}</ref> Other conspirators arrested for de Dios<U+2019> murder were Juan Velasco, who turned informant and was given 15 years along with his wife Elizabeth Castano who also cooperated and was given an 18 year sentence.<ref name=cpj>{{cite web|last=Bilello |first=Suzanne |url=http://cpj.org/tags/manuel-de-dios-unanue |title=Attacks on the Press 1999: United States |publisher=Committee to Protect Journalists |date=2002-03-22 |accessdate=2012-09-23}}</ref> Another conspirator, Guillermo Gaviria, remained a fugitive until his arrest in [[Colombia]] 18 April 1999.<ref name=cpj /><ref name=NYtimes04191999>{{cite news|first=Ginger |last=Thompson |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/19/nyregion/suspect-in-journalist-s-slaying-is-arrested.html |title=Suspect in Journalist's Slaying Is Arrested |publisher=New York Times |date=1999-04-19 |accessdate=2012-11-02}}</ref> 

On 9 March 1994, Mejia-Velez, the only one of the conspirators to go before a jury, was convicted of killing de Dios. His conviction was based in large part on the testimony of Mena and two other conspirators, Elkin Farley Salazar and Jose James Benitez, who each received 18-year sentences in exchange for their testimony against Mejia-Velez. At Mejia-Velez<U+2019>s trial, prosecution witnesses identified a leader of the Cali cartel, Jos<U+00E9> Santacruz Londo<U+00F1>o, as the instigator of the plot.<ref name=nytimes1994 /><ref name=cpj /> Londo<U+00F1>o, however, was at large in Colombia and due to extradition issues, could not be brought to the U.S. to stand trial for de Dios<U+2019> murder, even if found, according to deputy U.S. attorney Eric Friedberg.<ref name=nytimes1994 /> Co-conspirator and government informant John Mena avoided a possible life sentence and on May 10, 1996 was given 18 years for his part in arranging de Dios<U+2019> killing.<ref name=nytimes1996 /> Mena had earlier alleged it was Londo<U+00F1>o who had ordered the hit on de Dios.<ref name=nydailynews1999 /> Londo<U+00F1>o was killed by Colombian police 5 March 1996, shortly after U.S. authorities made public its decision to withhold partial funding to Colombia<U+2019>s government due to that country<U+2019>s failure to prosecute its war on drug traffickers more aggressively.<ref name=nydailynews1996 />

== Context ==
After de Dios<U+2019> murder, it was determined that he was marked for death because of his reporting of the activities of the Cali cartel, according to authorities.<ref name=NYdailynews06291995>{{cite news|first=Blanca|last=Quantanila|title=Slain Journalist Honored|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/boroughs/slain-journalist-honored-article-1.683980 |publisher=NY Daily News |date=1995-06-29 |accessdate=2012-11-02}}</ref> "It looks like all the rules are off," said an unnamed detective involved in solving de Dios<U+2019> killing.<ref name=PeopleMagazine />  Londo<U+00F1>o allegedly ordered the murder of de Dios because of the journalist<U+2019>s upcoming book called ''Partyloving Cali'' which threatened to further expose the drug trafficker<U+2019>s activities, federal prosecutors asserted.<ref name=nydailynews1996 /><ref name=NYdailynews06291995 /> Though the killing of anti-drug trafficking journalists was commonplace in Colombia, de Dios<U+2019> murder was the first to be committed on U.S. soil.<ref name=PeopleMagazine /> "Many of us are very shook up. We thought we were immune," said Miguel Perez, who was a friend of de Dios as well as a fellow journalist and editor of the New York weekly ''Latino News''.<ref name=PeopleMagazine /> "The same tactics repeatedly used by Colombian cocaine traffickers in South America to silence their critics were used here and that is something we will not tolerate,<U+201D> proclaimed Queens District Attorney Richard A. Brown. New York Mayor David N. Dinkins declared, "This [conviction] will serve as a reminder to those who would seek to silence our society's crusaders, to murder the illuminators of our society's dark places and to undermine one of our fundamental national rights should know we will never rest in pursuing them."<ref name=rjgeib>{{cite web|url=http://www.rjgeib.com/heroes/unanue/unanue.html |title=Manuel de Dios Unanue |publisher=Rjgeib.com |date=1992-03-11 |accessdate=2012-11-02}}</ref>

== Impact == 
"It seems to me he laid [down] his life for all society," said [[John Cardinal O'Connor]] to the 1,500 people who attended a memorial service for de Dios at [[St. Patrick's Cathedral]].<ref name=nydaily2002>{{cite news|first=Albor|last=Ruiz|title=Another Journalist Who Died In War |url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2002-03-07/local/18190709_1_dios-unanue-traffickers-cartel|publisher=New York Daily News|date=2002-03-07 |accessdate=2012-09-23}}</ref>

On June 28, 1995, the New York City Council, at the urging of bill sponsor Councilman [[Guillermo Linares]] (D-Manhattan), voted unanimously to designate 83rd Street, between Baxter and Roosevelt Avenues, Manuel de Dios Unanue Street, expanding on a decision made in March 1993, for New York City to set aside land on 83rd St as a park, designated the Manuel de Dios Unanue Triangle, in honor of de Dios.<ref name=nydailynews1999 /><ref name=NYdailynews06291995 />
