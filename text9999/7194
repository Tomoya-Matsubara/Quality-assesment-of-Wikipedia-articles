The '''Thirteenth Amendment''' to the [[United States Constitution]] abolished [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and [[involuntary servitude]], except as punishment for a crime. It was passed by the Senate on April 8, 1864, by the House on January 31, 1865, and adopted on December 6, 1865. On December 18, 1865, [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[William H. Seward]] proclaimed it to have been adopted. It was the first of the three [[Reconstruction Amendments]] adopted following the [[American Civil War]].

Slavery had been tacitly protected in the original Constitution through clauses such as the [[Three-Fifths Compromise]], in which three-fifths of the slave population was counted for representation in the [[United States House of Representatives]]. Prior to the Thirteenth Amendment, more than sixty years had passed since the [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution|last amendment to the Constitution]] had been successfully ratified. Though many slaves had been declared free by Lincoln's 1863 [[Emancipation Proclamation]], their post-war status was uncertain. On April 8, 1864, the Senate passed an amendment to abolish slavery. After one unsuccessful vote and extensive legislative maneuvering by the Lincoln administration, the House followed suit on January 31, 1865. The measure was swiftly ratified by nearly all [[Union (Civil War)|Union states]], and by a sufficient number of border and "reconstructed" Southern states to cause it to be adopted before the end of the year.

Though the amendment formally abolished slavery throughout the United States, factors such as [[Black Codes (United States)|Black Codes]], white supremacist violence, and selective enforcement of statutes continued to subject some black Americans to involuntary labor, particularly in the South. In contrast to the other Reconstruction Amendments, the Thirteenth Amendment was rarely cited in later case law, but has been used to strike down [[debt peonage]] and some race-based discrimination as "badges and incidents of slavery". Unlike the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth]] and [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth]] Amendments, the Thirteenth applies to private citizens as well as [[state actor]]s. The amendment also enables Congress to pass laws against [[sex trafficking]] and other modern forms of slavery.

"Nineteenth century apologists for the expansion of slavery developed a political philosophy that placed property at the pinnacle of personal interests and regarded its protection to be the government's chief purpose. The Fifth Amendment's Just Compensation clause provided the proslavery camp with a bastion for fortifying the peculiar institution against congressional restrictions to its spread westward. Based on this property-rights centered argument, Chief Justice Roger B. Taney, in ''Dred Scott v. Sanford'' (1857), found the Missouri Compromise unconstitutionally violated due process."</ref> Slavery was supported in law and in practice by a pervasive culture of [[white supremacy]].<ref>Tsesis, ''The Thirteenth Amendment and American Freedom'' (2004), pp. 18<U+2013>23. "Constitutional protections of slavery coexisted with an entire culture of oppression. The peculiar institution reached many private aspects of human life, for both whites and blacks. [...] Even free Southern blacks lived in a world so legally constricted by racial domination that it offered only a deceptive shadow of freedom."</ref>

Between 1777 and 1804, every Northern state provided for the immediate or gradual abolition of slavery. No Southern state did so, and the slave population of the South continued to grow, peaking at almost 4 million people in 1861.<ref name="Foner<U+2014>2010<U+2014><U+2014>14&amp;ndash;16">[[#CITEREFFoner2010|Foner, 2010]], pp. 14&ndash;16</ref> An [[Abolitionism|abolitionist movement]] headed by such figures as [[William Lloyd Garrison]] grew in strength in the North, calling for the end of slavery nationwide and exacerbating tensions between North and South. In 1836, the [[United States House of Representatives]] instituted a [[gag rule]] against abolitionist petitions and speeches, attempting to stifle [[John Quincy Adams]] and other abolitionist congressmen. The [[American Colonization Society]], an alliance between abolitionists who felt the races should be kept separated and slaveholders who feared the presence of freed blacks would encourage slave rebellions, called for the emigration and colonization of both free blacks and slaves to Africa. Its views were endorsed by politicians such as [[Henry Clay]], who feared that the main abolitionist movement would provoke a civil war.<ref name="Foner<U+2014>2010<U+2014><U+2014>20&amp;ndash;22">[[#CITEREFFoner2010|Foner, 2010]], pp. 20&ndash;22</ref> Proposals to eliminate slavery by constitutional amendment were introduced by Representative [[Arthur Livermore]] in 1818 and by John Quincy Adams in 1839, but failed to gain significant traction.<ref name="Vile">{{cite encyclopedia|year=2003|title=Thirteenth Amendment|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Constitutional Amendments, Proposed Amendments, and Amending Issues: 1789 - 2002|publisher=ABC-CLIO|editor-first=John R.|editor-last=Vile|pages=449&ndash;52}}</ref>

As the country continued to expand, the issue of slavery in its new territories became the dominant national issue. The Southern position was that slaves were property and therefore could be moved to the territories like all other forms of property.<ref name="Goodwin<U+2014>2005<U+2014><U+2014>123">[[#CITEREFGoodwin2005|Goodwin, 2005]], p. 123</ref> The 1820 [[Missouri Compromise]] provided for the admission of Missouri as a slave state and Maine as a free state, preserving the Senate's equality between the regions. In 1846, the [[Wilmot Proviso]] was introduced to a war appropriations bill to ban slavery in all territories acquired in the [[Mexican<U+2013>American War]]; the Proviso repeatedly passed the House, but not the Senate.<ref name="Goodwin<U+2014>2005<U+2014><U+2014>123"/> The [[Compromise of 1850]] temporarily defused the issue by admitting California as a free state, instituting a stronger [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850|Fugitive Slave Act]], banning the slave trade in Washington, D.C., and allowing New Mexico and Utah self-determination on the slavery issue.<ref name="Foner<U+2014>2010<U+2014><U+2014>59">[[#CITEREFFoner2010|Foner, 2010]], p. 59</ref>

Despite the compromise, tensions between North and South continued to rise over the subsequent decade, inflamed by, amongst other things, the publication of the 1852 anti-slavery novel ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'';<ref name="McPherson<U+2014>1988<U+2014><U+2014>88&amp;ndash;91">[[#CITEREFMcPherson1988|McPherson, 1988]], pp. 88&ndash;91</ref> [[Bleeding Kansas|fighting between pro-slave and abolitionist forces]] in Kansas, beginning in 1854;<ref name="McPherson<U+2014>1988<U+2014><U+2014>146&amp;ndash;50">[[#CITEREFMcPherson1988|McPherson, 1988]], pp. 146&ndash;50</ref> the 1857 ''Dred Scott'' decision, which struck down provisions of the Compromise of 1850;<ref name="McPherson<U+2014>1988<U+2014><U+2014>170&amp;ndash;77">[[#CITEREFMcPherson1988|McPherson, 1988]], pp. 170&ndash;77</ref> abolitionist [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown's]] 1859 attempt to start a slave revolt at [[John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry|Harpers Ferry]];<ref name="McPherson<U+2014>1988<U+2014><U+2014>201&amp;ndash;06">[[#CITEREFMcPherson1988|McPherson, 1988]], pp. 201&ndash;06</ref> and the 1860 election of slavery critic [[Abraham Lincoln]] to the presidency.

[[File:James Mitchell Ashley - Brady-Handy.jpg|thumb|Representative [[James Mitchell Ashley]] proposed an amendment abolishing slavery in 1863.]]
Acting under presidential war powers, Lincoln issued an [[Emancipation Proclamation]] on January 1, 1863, declaring all slaves in rebel-controlled territory to be free; however, the proclamation did not affect the status of slaves in the border states that had remained loyal to the Union.<ref name="McPherson<U+2014>1988<U+2014><U+2014>558">[[#CITEREFMcPherson1988|McPherson, 1988]], p. 558</ref> Lincoln followed with the December 1863 "[[Ten percent plan|Proclamation for Amnesty and Reconstruction]]", which offered Southern states a chance to peacefully rejoin the Union if they abolished slavery and collected loyalty oaths from 10% of their voting population.<ref>Vorenberg, ''Final Freedom'' (2001), p. 47.</ref> Southern states did not readily accept the deal, and the status of slavery remained uncertain.

In the final years of the Civil War, Union lawmakers debated various proposals for Reconstruction.<ref>Vorenberg, ''Final Freedom'' (2001), p. 48<U+2013>51.</ref> Some of these called for a constitutional amendment to abolish slavery nationally and permanently. On December 14, 1863, a bill proposing such an amendment was introduced by Representative [[James Mitchell Ashley]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/entry.php?rec=129|title=James Ashley|work=Ohio History Central|publisher=Ohio Historical Society|accessdate=December 4, 2012}}</ref> Representative [[James F. Wilson]] soon followed with a similar proposal. On January 11, 1864, Senator [[John B. Henderson]] of Missouri submitted a [[joint resolution]] for a constitutional amendment abolishing slavery. The [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary|Senate Judiciary Committee]], chaired by [[Lyman Trumbull]], became involved in merging different proposals for an amendment.

[[Radical Republicans]] led by Senator [[Charles Sumner]] and Representative [[Thaddeus Stevens]] sought a more expansive version of the amendment.<ref>Tsesis, ''The Thirteenth Amendment and American Freedom'' (2004), (2001), pp. 38<U+2013>42.</ref> On February 8, 1864, Sumner submitted a constitutional amendment stating:

<blockquote><U+201C>All persons are equal before the law, so that no person can hold another as a slave; and the Congress shall have power to make all laws necessary and proper to carry this declaration into effect everywhere in the United States.<U+201D><ref>Stanley, <U+201C>Instead of Waiting for the Thirteenth Amendment<U+201D> (2010), pp. 741<U+2013>742.</ref><ref name="SocietyCommission1901">{{cite book|author=Michigan State Historical Society|title=Historical collections|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Yx0zAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA582|accessdate=December 5, 2012|year=1901|publisher=Michigan Historical Commission|page=582}}</ref></blockquote>

Sumner tried to circumvent the Judiciary Committee, controlled by Trumbull, in order to promote his more expansive wording, but failed.<ref>Vorenberg, ''Final Freedom'' (2001), pp. 52<U+2013>53. "Sumner made his intentions clearer on February 8, when he introduced his constitutional amendment to the Senate and asked that it be referred to his new committee. So desperate was he to make his amendment the final version that he challenged the well-accepted custom of sending proposed amendments to the Judiciary Committee. His Republican colleagues would hear nothing of it.</ref> On February 10 the Senate Judiciary Committee presented the Senate with an amendment proposal based on drafts of Ashley, Wilson and Henderson.<ref>[http://13thamendment.harpweek.com/hubpages/CommentaryPage.asp?Commentary=05ProposalPassage "Congressional Proposals and Senate Passage"], ''Harpers Weekly'', ''The Creation of the 13th Amendment'', Retrieved Feb 15, 2007</ref><ref>Vorenberg, ''Final Freedom'' (2001), p. 53. "It was no coincidence that Trumbull's announcement came only two days after Sumner had proposed his amendment making all persons 'equal before the law.' The Massachusetts senator had spurred the committee into final action."</ref>

The Committee's version used text from the [[Northwest Ordinance]] of 1787, which stipulates (for territories in the region now called the [[Midwest]]): "There shall be neither slavery nor involuntary servitude in the said territory, otherwise than in punishment of crimes, whereof the party shall have been duly convicted."<ref>McAward, "McCulloch and the Thirteenth Amendment" (2012), p. 1786</ref> Though using Henderson's proposed amendment as the basis for its new draft, the Judiciary Committee removed language that would have reduced the Article V standards for amendment (requiring only a majority vote in Congress and ratification by two-thirds of the states).<ref>Vorenberg, ''Final Freedom'' (2001), p. 54. "Although it made Henderson's amendment the foundation of the final amendment, the committee rejected an article in Henderson's version that allowed the amendment to be adopted by the approval of only a simple majority in Congress and the ratification of only two-thirds of the states."</ref>

The Senate passed the amendment on April 8, 1864, by a vote of 38 to 6. However, just over two months later on June 15, the House failed to do so, with 93 in favor and 65 against, thirteen votes short of the two-thirds vote needed for passage; the vote split largely along party lines, with Republicans supporting and Democrats opposing.<ref name="Goodwin<U+2014>2005<U+2014><U+2014>686">[[#CITEREFGoodwin2005|Goodwin, 2005]], p. 686</ref> In the 1864 presidential race, former [[Free Soil Party]] candidate [[John C. Fr<U+00E9>mont]] threatened a third party run opposing Lincoln, this time on a platform endorsing an anti-slavery amendment.

===Congressional debate===

With no Southern states represented, few members of Congress pushed moral and religious arguments in favor of slavery. Democrats who opposed the amendment generally made arguments based on [[federalism]] and [[state's rights]].<ref>Benedict, "Constitutional Politics, Constitutional Law, and the Thirteenth Amendment" (2012), p. 179.</ref> Some argued that the proposed change so violated the spirit of the Constitution that it would not be a valid "amendment" but would instead constitute "revolution".<ref>Benedict, "Constitutional Politics, Constitutional Law, and the Thirteenth Amendment" (2012), p. 179<U+2013>180. Benedict quotes Sen. [[Garrett Davis]]: "there is a boundary between the power of revolution and the power of amendment, which the latter, as established in our Constitution, cannot pass; and that if the proposed change is revolutionary it would be null and void, notwithstanding it might be formally adopted." Full text of Davis's speech, with comments from others can be found in ''[http://www.archive.org/stream/greatdebatesina17millgoog/greatdebatesina17millgoog_djvu.txt Great Debates in American History]'' (1918), ed. Marion Mills Miller.</ref>  Some opponents warned that the amendment would lead to full citizenship for blacks.<ref name="Colbert, 1995 p. 10">Colbert, <U+201C>Liberating the Thirteenth Amendment<U+201D> (1995), p. 10.</ref>

Republicans argued that slavery was uncivilized and that abolition was a necessary step in national progress.<ref>Benedict, "Constitutional Politics, Constitutional Law, and the Thirteenth Amendment" (2012), p. 182.</ref> Amendment supporters also argued that the slave system had negative effects on white people. These included the lower wages resulting from competition with forced labor, as well as repression of abolitionist whites in the South. Ending slavery, said advocates, would restore the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] and other constitutional rights violated by censorship and intimidation in slave states.<ref name="Colbert, 1995 p. 10"/><ref>TenBroek, Jacobus. <U+201C>Thirteenth Amendment<U+201D> (1951), p. 180. <U+201C>It would make it possible for white citizens to exercise their constitutional right under the comity clause to reside in Southern states regardless of their opinions. It would carry out the constitutional declaration "that each citizen of the United States shall have equal privileges in every other state." It would protect citizens in their rights under the First Amendment and comity clause to freedom of speech, freedom of press, freedom of religion and freedom of assembly.<U+201D></ref>
 
White Northern Republicans, and some Democrats, became excited about an abolition amendment, holding meetings and issuing resolutions.<ref>Vorenberg, ''Final Freedom'' (2001), p. 61.</ref> Many blacks, particularly in the South, focused more on landownership and education as the key to liberation.<ref name=TreleaseXvii>Trelease, ''White Terror'' (1971), p. xvii. <U+201C>Negroes wanted the same freedom that white men enjoyed, with equal prerogatives and opportunities. The educated black minority emphasized civil and political rights more than the masses, who called most of all for land and schools. In an agrarian society, the only kind most of them knew, landownership was associated with freedom, respectability, and the good life. It was almost universally desired by Southern blacks, as it was by landless peasants the world over. Give us our land and we can take care of ourselves, said a group of South Carolina Negroes to a Northern journalist in 1865; without land the old masters can hire us or starve us as they please.<U+201D></ref> As slavery began to seem politically untenable, an array of Northern Democrats gradually announced their support for the amendment, including Representative [[James Brooks (politician)|James Brooks]],<ref>Vorenberg, ''Final Freedom'' (2001), p. 73. "The first notable convert was Representative James Brooks of New York, who, on the floor of Congress on February 18, 1864, declared that slavery was dying if not already dead, and that his party should stop defending the institution."</ref> Senator [[Reverdy Johnson]],<ref>Vorenberg, ''Final Freedom'' (2001), p. 74. "The antislavery amendment caught Johnson's eye, however, because it offered an indisputable constitutional solution to the problem of slavery."</ref> and [[Tammany Hall]], a powerful New York [[political machine]].<ref>Vorenberg, ''Final Freedom'' (2001), p. 203.</ref>

===Passage by Congress===

Lincoln had been concerned that the Emancipation Proclamation might be reversed or found invalid after the war and saw constitutional amendment as a more permanent solution.<ref name="Foner<U+2014>2010<U+2014><U+2014>312&amp;ndash;14">[[#CITEREFFoner2010|Foner, 2010]], pp. 312&ndash;14</ref><ref name="Donald<U+2014>1996<U+2014><U+2014>396">[[#CITEREFDonald1996|Donald, 1996]], p. 396</ref> He had remained outwardly neutral on the amendment because he considered it politically too dangerous.<ref>Vorenberg, ''Final Freedom'' (2001), p. 48. <U+201C>The president worried that an abolition amendment might foul the political waters. The amendments he had recommended in December 1862 had gone nowhere, mainly because they reflected an outdated program of gradual emancipation, which included compensation and colonization. Moreover, Lincoln knew that he did not have to propose amendments because others more devoted to abolition would, especially if he pointed out the vulnerability of existing emancipation legislation. He was also concerned about negative reactions from conservatives, particularly potential new recruits from the Democrats.</ref> Nonetheless, Lincoln's 1864 party platform resolved to abolish slavery by constitutional amendment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sewanee.edu/faculty/willis/Civil_War/documents/republican.html | title=Republican Party Platform, 1864| author= Willis, John C. | publisher=University of the South|accessdate=2013-06-28: "Resolved, That as slavery was the cause, and now constitutes the strength of this Rebellion, and as it must be, always and everywhere, hostile to the principles of Republican Government, justice and the National safety demand its utter and complete extirpation from the soil of the Republic; and that, while we uphold and maintain the acts and proclamations by which the Government, in its own defense, has aimed a deathblow at this gigantic evil, we are in favor, furthermore, of such an amendment to the Constitution, to be made by the people in conformity with its provisions, as shall terminate and forever prohibit the existence of Slavery within the limits of the jurisdiction of the United States."}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://rmc.library.cornell.edu/vote/1864/index.html|title=1864: The Civil War Election|publisher=Cornell University|work=Get Out the Vote|year=2004|accessdate=2013-06-28: "Despite internal Party conflicts, Republicans rallied around a platform that supported restoration of the Union and the abolition of slavery."}}</ref> After winning the [[United States presidential election, 1864|election of 1864]], Lincoln made the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment his top legislative priority, beginning his efforts while the "lame duck" session was still in office.<ref name="Goodwin<U+2014>2005<U+2014><U+2014>686&amp;ndash;87">[[#CITEREFGoodwin2005|Goodwin, 2005]], pp. 686&ndash;87</ref><ref>Vorenberg, ''Final Freedom'' (2001), p. 176<U+2013>177, 180.</ref> Popular support for the amendment was mounting and Lincoln urged Congress on in his December 6 State of the Union speech: <U+201C>there is only a question of ''time'' as to when the proposed amendment will go to the States for their action.

[[File:AdoptionOf13thAmendment.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Celebration erupts after the amendment was passed by the House of Representatives.]]

Secretary of State William H. Seward, Representative [[John B. Alley]] and others were instructed by Lincoln to procure votes by any means necessary, and promised government posts and campaign contributions to outgoing Democrats willing to switch sides.<ref name="Foner<U+2014>2010<U+2014><U+2014>312&amp;ndash;13">[[#CITEREFFoner2010|Foner, 2010]], pp. 312&ndash;13</ref><ref name="Goodwin<U+2014>2005<U+2014><U+2014>687">[[#CITEREFGoodwin2005|Goodwin, 2005]], p. 687</ref> Seward had a large fund for direct bribes. Ashley, who reintroduced the measure into the House, also lobbied several Democrats to vote in favor of the measure.<ref name="Goodwin<U+2014>2005<U+2014><U+2014>687&amp;ndash;689">[[#CITERE FGoodwin2005|Goodwin, 2005]], pp. 687&ndash;689</ref> Representative Thaddeus Stevens commented later that "the greatest measure of the nineteenth century was passed by corruption, aided and abetted by the purest man in America"; however, Lincoln's precise role in making deals for votes remains unknown.<ref name="Donald<U+2014>1996<U+2014><U+2014>554">[[#CITEREFDonald1996|Donald, 1996]], p. 554</ref>

Republicans in Congress claimed a mandate for abolition, having gained in the elections for [[United States Senate elections, 1864|Senate]] and [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1864|House]].<ref>Vorenberg, ''Final Freedom'' (2001), p. 187. <U+201C>But the clearest sign of the people's voice against slavery, argued amendment supporters, was the recent election. Following Lincoln's lead, Republican representatives like Godlove S. Orth of Indiana claimed that the vote represented a 'popular verdict . . . in unmistakable language' in favor of the amendment.</ref> Opposition to the measure was led by the 1864 Democratic vice presidential nominee, Representative [[George H. Pendleton]].<ref name="Goodwin<U+2014>2005<U+2014><U+2014>688">[[#CITEREFGoodwin2005|Goodwin, 2005]], p. 688</ref> Republicans toned down their language of radical equality in order to broaden the amendment's coalition of supporters.<ref>Vorenberg, ''Final Freedom'' (2001), p. 191. <U+201C>The necessity of keeping support for the amendment broad enough to secure its passage created a strange situation. At the moment that Republicans were promoting new, far-reaching legislation for African Americans, they had to keep this legislation detached from the first constitutional amendment dealing exclusively with African American freedom. Republicans thus gave freedom under the antislavery amendment a vague construction: freedom was something more than the absence of chattel slavery but less than absolute equality.<U+201D></ref> In order to reassure critics worried that the amendment would tear apart the social fabric, some Republicans explicitly promised that the amendment would leave patriarchy intact.<ref>Vorenberg, ''Final Freedom'' (2001), pp. 191<U+2013>192. <U+201C>One of the most effective methods used by amendment supporters to convey the measure's conservative character was to proclaim the permanence of patriarchal power within the American family in the face of this or ''any'' textual change to the Constitution. In response to Democrats who charged that the antislavery was but the first step in a Republican design to dissolve all of society's foundations, including the hierarchical structure of the family, the Iowa Republican John A. Kasson denied any desire to interfere with 'the rights of a husband to a wife' or 'the right of [a] father to his child.<U+201D></ref>

In mid-January, Speaker of the House [[Schuyler Colfax]] estimated the amendment to be five votes short of passage.

I wish you could see it to be your duty to vote for the Constitutional amendment ending slavery.</ref> On January 31, 1865, the House called another vote on the amendment, with neither side being certain of the outcome.

The amendment was sent to the state legislatures. Most Northern states quickly ratified it, the only exceptions being those won by Democratic candidate [[George B. McClellan]] in the 1864 election: Delaware, Kentucky, and New Jersey.

The war had not officially ended, and the legal status of the defeated Southern states (and by extension, the legal requirements for Constitutional amendment) remained ambiguous. Nevertheless, ratifications from Reconstruction governments in the Southern states of Louisiana, Arkansas, Virginia, and Tennessee were submitted and accepted.<ref name="McPherson<U+2014>1988<U+2014><U+2014>840"/><ref>Harrison, <U+201C>Lawfulness of the Reconstruction Amendments<U+201D> (2001), p. 390. "Those ratifications raised some tricky questions. Four of them came from organizations purporting to be the legislatures of Virginia, Louisiana, Tennessee, and Arkansas. What about them? How many states were there, how many of them had legally valid legislatures, and if there were fewer legislatures than states, did Article V require ratification by three-fourths of the states or three-fourths of the legally valid state legislatures?"</ref> Kentucky rejected the amendment quickly and bitterly, having considered slavery its reward for loyalty during the War.<ref>Forehand, <U+201C>Striking Resemblance<U+201D> (1996), pp. 126<U+2013>127.</ref>

On April 14, 1865, President Lincoln [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|was assassinated]]. With Congress out of session, Lincoln's successor [[Andrew Johnson]] began a period known as "Presidential Reconstruction", in which he personally oversaw the creation of new governments in seven Southern states.{{efn|The seven states were North Carolina, Mississippi, Georgia, Texas, Alabama, South Carolina, and Florida.}} Johnson established political conventions populated by delegates he had approved, and strongly encouraged them to ratify the amendment.<ref>Harrison, "Lawfulness of the Reconstruction Amendments" (2001), p. 394<U+2013>397. "Then came the kicker: The President decided who was loyal, prescribing suffrage qualifications for electing the convention. [...] Pursuant to Johnson's proclamations, the provisional governors organized elections for conventions. Six met in 1865, while Texas's convention did not organize until March 1866. Three leading issues came before the convention: secession itself, the abolition of slavery, and the Confederate war debt."</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Eric L.

Excluding these states might come at the embarrassing price of nullifying constitutional emancipation.<U+201D></ref>

Direct negotiations between state governments and the Johnson administration ensued. Johnson suggested directly to the governors of Mississippi and North Carolina that they could proactively control the allocation of rights to freedmen.<ref>Vorenberg, ''Final Freedom'' (2001), p. 229. <U+201C>Desperate for the amendment's adoption, the Johnson administration in late summer supplemented its demand for ratification with assurances of the measure's limited scope. To the governors of North Carolina and Mississippi, the president sent messages recommending that, in addition to pressing for ratification, they should also propose 'such laws <U+2026> for the protection of freedmen, in person and property, as justice and equity demand. Johnson obviously expected the freed people to enjoy at least some civil rights, including, as he specified, the right to testify in court, but he wanted state lawmakers to know that the power to confer such rights would remain with the states.</ref> South Carolina's provisional governor [[Benjamin Franklin Perry]] objected to the scope of the Amendment's enforcement clause; Secretary of State Seward responded by telegraph that in fact the second clause "is really restraining in its effect, instead of enlarging the powers of Congress".<ref>Vorenberg, ''Final Freedom'' (2001), p. 229.</ref> The white politicians of South Carolina, and of other Southern states, were concerned that Congress might cite the amendment's enforcement powers as authorization for black suffrage.<ref>DuBois, ''Black Reconstruction'' (1935), p. 208. <U+201C>Charles Sumner and others declared that [the enforcement clause] gave Congress power to enfranchise Negroes if such a step was necessary to their freedom.

Following the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment by Congress, Republicans grew concerned over the increase it would create in the congressional representation of the Democratic-dominated Southern states. Because the full population of freed slaves would be counted rather than three-fifths, the Southern states would dramatically increase their power in the population-based House of Representatives.{{sfn|Goldstone|2011|p=22}}<ref name="Stromberg111">Stromberg, "A Plain Folk Perspective" (2002), p. 111.</ref> Republicans hoped to offset this advantage by attracting and protecting votes of the newly enfranchised black population.{{sfn|Goldstone|2011|p=22}}<ref>{{cite book |title=The Fourteenth Amendment: From Political Principle to Judicial Doctrine |last=Nelson |first=William E. |year=1988 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=9780674041424 |page=47 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=VMCXjRyyKTQC&pg=PA46&dq=thirteenth+amendment+%22three+fifths%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=Bz-xUemzGMX8rAGamYDgDQ&ved=0CEQQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=thirteenth%20amendment%20%22three%20fifths%22&f=false |accessdate=June 6, 2013}}</ref><ref>Stromberg, "A Plain Folk Perspective" (2002), p. 112.</ref>

=== Political and economic change in the South ===

Southern culture remained deeply racist, and those blacks who remained faced a dangerous situation. J. J. Gries reported to the [[Joint Committee on Reconstruction]]: <U+201C>There is a kind of innate feeling, a lingering hope among many in the South that slavery will be regalvanized in some shape or other. They tried by their laws to make a worse slavery than there was before, for the freedman has not the protection which the master from interest gave him before.<U+201D><ref name=Gries>J. J. Gries to the [[Joint Committee on Reconstruction]], quoted in DuBois, ''Black Reconstruction'' (1935), p. 140.</ref> [[W. E. B. Du Bois]] wrote in 1935:

<blockquote>Slavery was not abolished even after the Thirteenth Amendment. There were four million freedmen and most of them on the same plantation, doing the same work that they did before emancipation, except as their work had been interrupted and changed by the upheaval of war. Moreover, they were getting about the same wages and apparently were going to be subject to slave codes modified only in name. There were among them thousands of fugitives in the camps of the soldiers or on the streets of the cities, homeless, sick, and impoverished. They had been freed practically with no land nor money, and, save in exceptional cases, without legal status, and without protection.<ref>DuBois, ''Black Reconstruction'' (1935), p. 188.</ref><ref>Quoted in Vorenberg, ''Final Freedom'' (2001), p. 244.</ref></blockquote>

Official emancipation did not substantially alter the economic situation of most blacks who remained in the south.<ref>Trelease, ''White Terror'' (1971), p. xviii. "The truth seems to be that, after a brief exulation with the idea of freedom, Negroes realized that their position was hardly changed; they continued to live and work much as they had before."</ref>

As the amendment still permitted labor as punishment for convicted criminals, Southern states responded with what historian [[Douglas A. Blackmon]] called "an array of interlocking laws essentially intended to criminalize black life".{{sfn|Blackmon|2008|p=53}} These laws, passed or updated after emancipation, were known as [[Black Codes (United States)|Black Codes]].<ref name="Stromberg111" /> Mississippi was the first state to pass such codes, with an 1865 law titled <U+201C>An Act to confer Civil Rights on Freedmen<U+201D>.<ref name=Novak2>Novak, ''Wheel of Servitude'' (1978), p. 2.</ref> The Mississippi law required black workers to contract with white farmers by January 1 of each year or face punishment for vagrancy.{{sfn|Blackmon|2008|p=53}} Blacks could be sentenced to forced labor for crimes including petty theft, using obscene language, or selling cotton after sunset.{{sfn|Blackmon|2008|p=100}} States passed new, strict [[Vagrancy (people)|vagrancy]] laws that were selectively enforced against blacks without white protectors.{{sfn|Blackmon|2008|p=53}}<ref>Tsesis, ''The Thirteenth Amendment and American Freedom'' (2004), pp. 51<U+2013>52.</ref> The labor of these convicts was then sold to farms, factories, lumber camps, quarries, and mines.{{sfn|Blackmon|2008|p=6}}

After (qualified) ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment in November 1865, the South Carolina legislature immediately began to legislate Black Codes.<ref>Vorenberg, ''Final Freedom'' (2001), pp. 230<U+2013>231. <U+201C>The black codes were a violation of freedom of contract, one of the civil rights that Republicans expected to flow from the amendment. Because South Carolina and other states anticipated that congressional Republicans would try to use the Thirteenth Amendment to outlaw the codes, they made the preemptive strike of declaring in their ratification resolutions that Congress could not use the amendment's second clause to legislate on freed people's civil rights.<U+201D></ref> The Black Codes created a separate set of laws, punishments, and acceptable behaviors for anyone with more than one black great-grandparent. Under these Codes, Blacks could only work as farmers or servants and had few Constitutional rights.<ref>Benjamin Ginsberg, ''Moses of South Carolina: A Jewish Scalawag during Radical Reconstruction''; Johns Hopkins Press, 2010; pp. [http://books.google.com/books?id=44uF943aw18C&lpg=PP1&pg=PA44#v=onepage&q&f=false 44]<U+2013>46.</ref> Restrictions on [[40 acres and a mule|black land ownership]] threatened to make economic subservience permanent.<ref name=TreleaseXvii />

Some states mandated indefinitely long periods of child "apprenticeship".<ref>Tsesis, ''The Thirteenth Amendment and American Freedom'' (2004), p. 50.</ref> Some laws did not target Blacks specifically, but instead affected farm workers, most of whom were Black. At the same time, many states passed laws to actively prevent Blacks from acquiring property.<ref>Tsesis, ''The Thirteenth Amendment and American Freedom'' (2004), p. 51.</ref>

Southern business owners sought to reproduce the profitable arrangement of slavery with a system called [[peonage]], in which (disproportionately black) workers were entrapped by loans and compelled to work indefinitely because of their debt.<ref>Wolff, <U+201C>The Thirteenth Amendment and Slavery in the Global Economy<U+201D> (2002), p. 981. <U+201C>Peonage was a system of forced labor that depended upon the indebtedness of a worker, rather than an actual property right in a slave, as the means of compelling work.  A prospective employer would offer a laborer a "loan" or "advance" on his wages, typically as a condition  of employment, and then use the newly created debt to compel the worker to remain on the job for as long as the employer wished.<U+201D></ref><ref name=Wolff982b /> Peonage continued well through Reconstruction and ensnared a large proportion of black workers in the South.<ref>Wolff, <U+201C>The Thirteenth Amendment and Slavery in the Global Economy<U+201D> (2002), p. 982. <U+201C>Legally sanctioned peonage arrangements blossomed in the South following the Civil War and continued into the twentieth century. According to the Professor Jacqueline Jones, 'perhaps as many as one-third of all [sharecropping farmers] in Alabama, Mississippi, and George were being held against their will in 1900.<U+201D></ref> These workers remained destitute and persecuted, forced to work dangerous jobs and further confined legally by the racist [[Jim Crow laws]] that governed the South.<ref name=Wolff982b>Wolff, <U+201C>The Thirteenth Amendment and Slavery in the Global Economy<U+201D> (2002), p. 982. <U+201C>Not surprisingly, employers used peonage arrangements primarily in industries that involved hazardous working conditions and very low pay. While black workers were not the exclusive victims of peonage arrangements in America, they suffered under its yoke in vastly disproportionate numbers. Along with Jim Crow laws that segregated transportation and public facilities, these laws helped to restrict the movement of freed black workers and thereby keep them in a state of poverty and vulnerability.<U+201D></ref> Peonage differed from chattel slavery because it was not strictly hereditary and did not allow the sale of people in exactly the same fashion. However, a person's debt<U+2014>and by extension a person<U+2014>could still be sold, and the system resembled antebellum slavery in many ways.<ref>Wolff, <U+201C>The Thirteenth Amendment and Slavery in the Global Economy<U+201D> (2002), p. 982. <U+201C>It did not recognize a property right in a human being (a peon could not be sold in the manner of a slave); and the condition of peonage did not work 'corruption of blood' and travel to the children of the worker. Peonage, in short, was not chattel slavery. Yet the practice unquestionably reproduced many of the immediate practical realities of slavery<U+2014>a vast underclass of laborers, held to their jobs by force of law and threat of imprisonment, with few if any opportunities for escape.<U+201D></ref>

==Congressional and executive enforcement==

As its first [[Congressional power of enforcement|enforcement legislation]], Congress passed the [[Civil Rights Act of 1866]], which guaranteed black Americans citizenship and equal protection of the law, though not the right to vote. The Amendment was also used as authorization for several [[Freedmen's Bureau bills]]. President Andrew Johnson vetoed these bills, but a Congressional supermajoirty overrode his veto to pass the Civil Rights Act and the Second Freedmen's Bureau Bill.<ref>Vorenberg, ''Final Freedom'' (2001), pp. 233<U+2013>234.</ref><ref>[[W. E. B. DuBois]], "[http://www.theatlantic.com/past/docs/issues/01mar/dubois2.htm The Freedmen's Bureau]", ''The Atlantic'', March 1901.</ref>

Proponents of the Act including Trumbull and Wilson argued that Section 2 of the Thirteenth Amendment (enforcement power) authorized the federal government to legislate civil rights for the States. Others disagreed, maintaining that inequality conditions were distinct from slavery.<ref>McAward, "McCulloch and the Thirteenth Amendment" (2012), pp. 1788<U+2013>1790.</ref> Seeking more substantial justification, and fearing that future opponents would again seek to overturn the legislation, Congress and the states added additional protections to the Constitution: the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] (1868), which defined citizenship and mandated equal protection under the law, and the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment]] (1870), which banned racial voting restrictions.{{sfn|Goldstone|2011|pp=23&ndash;24}}

The [[Freedmen's Bureau]] enforced the Amendment locally, providing a degree of support for people subject to the Black Codes.<ref>Tsesis, ''The Thirteenth Amendment and American Freedom'' (2004), pp. 50<U+2013>51. "Blacks applied to local provost marshalls and Freedmen's Bureau for help against these child abductions, particularly in those cases where children were taken from living parents. Jack Prince asked for help when a woman bound his maternal niece. Sally Hunter requested assistance to obtain the release of her two nieces. Bureau officials finally put an end to the system of indenture in 1867".</ref> (Reciprocally, the Thirteenth Amendment established the Bureau's legal basis to operate in Kentucky.)<ref>Forehand, <U+201C>Striking Resemblance<U+201D> (1996), p. 99<U+2013>100, 105.</ref> The Civil Rights Act circumvented racism in local jurisdictions by allowing blacks access to the federal courts. The [[Enforcement Acts]] of 1870<U+2013>1871 and the [[Civil Rights Act of 1875]], in combating the violence and intimidation of white supremacy, were also part of the effort to end slave conditions for Southern blacks.<ref name="Tsesis66">Tsesis, ''The Thirteenth Amendment and American Freedom'' (2004), p. 66<U+2013>67.</ref> However, the effect of these laws waned as political will diminished and the federal government lost authority in the South, particularly after the [[Compromise of 1877]] ended [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] in exchange for a Republican presidency.<ref>Tsesis, ''The Thirteenth Amendment and American Freedom'' (2004), pp. 56<U+2013>57, 60<U+2013>61. "If the Republicans had hoped to gradually use section 2 of the Thirteenth Amendment to pass Reconstruction legislation, they would soon learn that President Johnson, using his veto power, would make increasingly more difficult the passage of any measure augmenting the power of the national government. Further, with time, even leading antislavery Republicans would become less adamant and more willing to reconcile with the South than protect the rights of the newly freed. This was clear by the time Horace Greely accepted the Democratic nomination for president in 1872 and even more when President Rutherford B. Hayes entered the Compromise of 1877, agreeing to withdraw federal troops from the South."</ref>

=== Peonage law ===
With the [[Peonage Act of 1867]], Congress abolished <U+201C>the holding of any person to service or labor under the system known as peonage<U+201D>,<ref>Goluboff, <U+201C>Lost Origins of Civil Rights<U+201D> (2001), p. 1638.</ref> specifically banning <U+201C>the voluntary or involuntary service or labor of any persons as peons, in liquidation of any debt or obligation, or otherwise.<U+201D><ref>Soifer, <U+201C>Prohibition of Voluntary Peonage<U+201D> (2012), p. 1617.</ref>

In 1939, the Department of Justice created the Civil Rights Section, which focused primarily on [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] and [[labor rights|labor]] rights.<ref>Goluboff, <U+201C>Lost Origins of Civil Rights<U+201D> (2001), p. 1616.</ref> The increasing scrutiny of [[totalitarianism]] in the lead-up to World War II brought increased attention to issues of slavery and involuntary servitude, abroad and at home.<ref>Goluboff, <U+201C>Lost Origins of Civil Rights<U+201D> (2001), pp. 1619<U+2013>1621.</ref> The U.S. sought to counter foreign propaganda and increase its credibility on the race issue by combatting the Southern peonage system.<ref>Goluboff, <U+201C>Lost Origins of Civil Rights<U+201D> (2001), pp. 1626<U+2013>1628.</ref> Under the leadership of Attorney General [[Francis Biddle]], the Civil Rights Section invoked the constitutional amendments and legislation of the Reconstruction Era as the basis for its actions.<ref>Goluboff, <U+201C>Lost Origins of Civil Rights<U+201D> (2001), pp. 1629, 1635.</ref>

In 1947, the DOJ successfully prosecuted Elizabeth Ingalls for keeping domestic servant Dora L. Jones in conditions of slavery. The court found that Jones <U+201C>was a person wholly subject to the will of defendant; that she was one who had no freedom of action and whose person and services were wholly under the control of defendant and who was in a state of enforced compulsory service to the defendant.<U+201D><ref>Goluboff, <U+201C>Lost Origins of Civil Rights<U+201D> (2001), p. 1668.</ref> The Thirteenth Amendment enjoyed a swell of attention during this period, but from ''[[Brown v. Board]]'' (1954) until ''[[Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co.]]'' (1968) it was again eclipsed by the Fourteenth Amendment.<ref>Goluboff, <U+201C>Lost Origins of Civil Rights<U+201D>, pp. 1680<U+2013>1683.</ref>

Victims of human trafficking and other conditions of forced labor are commonly coerced by threat of legal actions to their detriment.

==Judicial interpretation==
In contrast to the other "Reconstruction Amendments", the Thirteenth Amendment was rarely cited in later case law. As historian Amy Dru Stanley summarizes, "beyond a handful of landmark rulings striking down debt peonage, <U+FB02>agrant involuntary servitude, and some instances of race-based violence and discrimination, the Thirteenth Amendment has never been a potent source of rights claims".<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Amy Dru Stanley |year=June 2010 |title=Instead of Waiting for the Thirteenth Amendment: The War Power, Slave Marriage, and Inviolate Human Rights |journal=American Historical Review |volume=115 |issue=3 |pages=735 |accessdate=June 4, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G2-3425002519.html |title=Thirteenth Amendment (Judicial Interpretation) |author=Kenneth L.

===Black slaves and their descendants ===
''U. S. v. Rhodes'' (1866),<ref>[http://www.scribd.com/doc/20825887/United-States-v-Rhodes-27-f-Cas-785-1866 27 Fed. Cas. 785 (1866)]</ref> one of the first Thirteenth Amendment cases, tested the Constitutionality of provisions in the Civil Rights Act of 1866 that granted blacks redress in the federal courts. Kentucky law prohibited blacks from testifying against whites<U+2014>an arrangement which compromised the ability of Nancy Talbot ("a citizen of the United States of the African race") to reach justice against a white person accused of robbing her. After Talbot attempted to try the case in federal court; the Kentucky Supreme Court ruled this federal option unconstitutional. [[Noah Swayne]] (a Supreme Court justice sitting on the Kentucky Circuit Court) overturned the Kentucky decision, holding that without the material enforcement provided by the Civil Rights Act, slavery would not truly be abolished.<ref>Tsesis, ''The Thirteenth Amendment and American Freedom'' (2004), pp. 62<U+2013>63.</ref><ref>Seth P. Waxman, "[http://scholarship.law.ge orgetown.edu/facpub/287/ Twins at Birth: Civil Rights and the Role of the Solicitor General]", ''Indiana Law Journal'' 75, 2000; pp. 1302<U+2013>1303.</ref> With ''In Re Turner'' (1867), Chief Justice [[Salmon P. Chase]] ordered freedom for Elizabeth Turner, a former slave in Maryland who became indentured to her former master.<ref>Tsesis, ''The Thirteenth Amendment and American Freedom'' (2004), pp. 63<U+2013>64.</ref>

In ''[[s:Blyew v. United States|Blyew v. U.S.]]'', (1872)<ref>80 U.S. 581 (1871)</ref> the Supreme Court heard another Civil Rights Act case relating to federal courts in Kentucky. John Bylew and George Kennard were white men visiting the cabin of a black family, the Fosters. Bylew apparently became angry with sixteen-year-old Richard Foster and hit him twice in the head with an ax. Bylew and Kennard killed Richard's parents, Sallie and Jack Foster, and his blind grandmother, Lucy Armstrong. They severely wounded the Fosters' two young daughters. Kentucky courts would not allow the Foster children to testify against Blyew and Kennard. But federal courts, authorized by the Civil Rights Act, found Blyew and Kennard guilty of murder. When the Supreme Court took the case, they ruled (5<U+2013>2) that the Foster children did not have standing in federal courts because only living people could take advantage of the Act. In doing so, the Courts effectively ruled that Thirteenth Amendment did not permit a federal remedy in murder cases. Swayne and [[Joseph P. Bradley]] dissented, maintaining that in order to have meaningful effects, the Thirteenth Amendment would have to address systemic racial oppression.<ref>Tsesis, ''The Thirteenth Amendment and American Freedom'' (2004), pp. 64<U+2013>66.</ref>

Though based on a technicality, the ''Blyew'' case set a precedent in state and federal courts that led to the erosion of Congress's Thirteenth Amendment powers. The Supreme Court continued along this path in the ''[[Slaughter-House Cases]]'' (1873), which upheld a state-sanctioned monopoly of white butchers. In ''[[United States v. Cruikshank]]'' (1876), the Court ignored Thirteenth Amendment dicta from a circuit court decision to exonerate perpetrators of the [[Colfax massacre]] and invalidate the [[Enforcement Act of 1870]].<ref name="Tsesis66" />
[[File:John-Marshall-Harlan-sketch.jpg|thumb|John Marshall Harlan became known as "The Great Dissenter" for his minority opinions favoring powerful Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |year= |title =John Marshall Harlan |encyclopedia=The U.S. Justice System: An Encyclopedia: An Encyclopedia |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-1-59884-305-7|location= |id= |last=Waskey |first=Andrew J. |editor-first=Steven Harmon |editor-last=Wilson |pages=547 }}</ref>]]
In ''[[Civil Rights Cases]]'' (1883),<ref>''Civil Rights Cases'', 109 U.S. 3 (1883)</ref>  the Supreme Court reviewed five consolidated cases dealing with the [[Civil Rights Act of 1875]], which outlawed racial discrimination at "inns, public conveyances on land or water, theaters, and other places of public amusement". The Court ruled that the Thirteenth Amendment did not ban most forms of racial discrimination by non-government actors.{{sfn|Goldstone|2011|p=122}} In the majority decision, Bradley wrote (again in non-binding dicta) that the Thirteenth Amendment empowered Congress to attack "badges and incidents of slavery". However, he distinguished between "fundamental rights" of citizenship, protected by the Thirteenth Amendment, and the "social rights of men and races in the community".<ref>Tsesis, ''The Thirteenth Amendment and American Freedom'' (2004), p. 70.</ref> The majority opinion held that "it would be running the slavery argument into the ground to make it apply to every act of discrimination which a person may see fit to make as to guests he will entertain, or as to the people he will take into his coach or cab or car; or admit to his concert or theatre, or deal with in other matters of intercourse or business."<ref>{{cite book|title=Appleton's Annual Cyclop<U+00E6>dia and Register of Important Events of the Year ...|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=YZ5RAAAAYAAJ|accessdate=June 11, 2013|year=1888|publisher=D. Appleton & Company|page=132}}</ref> In his solitary dissent, [[John Marshall Harlan]] (a Kentucky lawyer who changed his mind about civil rights law after witnessing organized racist violence) argued that "such discrimination practiced by corporations and individuals in the exercise of their public or quasi-public functions is a badge of servitude, the imposition of which congress may prevent under its power."<ref>Tsesis, ''The Thirteenth Amendment and American Freedom'' (2004), p. 73.</ref>

Attorneys in ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'' (1896)<ref>{{ussc|163|537|1896}}</ref> argued that [[racial segregation]] involved "observances of a servile character coincident with the incidents of slavery", in violation of the Thirteenth Amendment. In their brief to the Supreme Court, Plessy's lawyers wrote that "distinction of race and caste" was inherently unconstitutional.<ref>Tsesis, ''The Thirteenth Amendment and American Freedom'' (2004), p. 76.</ref> The Supreme Court rejected this reasoning and upheld state laws enforcing segregation under the "[[separate but equal]]" doctrine. In the (7<U+2013>1) majority decision, the Court found that "a statute which implies merely a legal distinction between the white and colored races&mdash;a distinction which is founded on the color of the two races and which must always exist so long as white men are distinguished from the other race by color&mdash;has no tendency to destroy the legal equality of the two races, or reestablish a state of involuntary servitude."{{sfn|Goldstone|2011|pp=162, 164&ndash;65}} Harlan dissented, writing: "The thin disguise of 'equal' accommodations for passengers in railroad coaches will not mislead any one, nor, atone for the wrong this day done."<ref>Tsesis, ''The Thirteenth Amendment and American Freedom'' (2004), p. 78.</ref>

In ''[[Hodges v. United States]]'' (1906),<ref>203 U.S. 1 (1906)</ref> the Court struck down a federal statute providing for the punishment of two or more people who "conspire to injure, oppress, threaten or intimidate any citizen in the free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege secured to him by the Constitution or laws of the United States". A group of white men in Arkansas conspired to violently prevent eight black workers from performing their jobs at a lumber mill; the group was convicted by a federal grand jury. The Supreme Court ruled that the federal statute, which outlawed conspiracies to deprive citizens of their liberty, was not authorized by the Thirteenth Amendment. It held that "no mere personal assault or trespass or appropriation operates to reduce the individual to a condition of slavery". Harlan dissented, maintaining his opinion that the Thirteenth Amendment should protect freedom beyond "physical restraint".<ref>Tsesis, ''The Thirteenth Amendment and American Freedom'' (2004), p. 79<U+2013>80.</ref>  ''Corrigan v. Buckley'' (1922) reaffirmed the interpretation from ''Hodges'', finding that the amendment does not apply to [[restrictive covenant]]s.

Enforcement of federal civil rights law in the South created numerous peonage cases, which slowly traveled up through the judiciary. The Supreme Court ruled in ''Clyatt v. United States'' (1905) that peonage was involuntary servitude. It held that although employers sometimes described their workers' entry into contract as voluntary, the servitude of peonage was always (by definition) involuntary.<ref>Wolff, <U+201C>The Thirteenth Amendment and Slavery in the Global Economy<U+201D> (2002), p. 983.</ref>

==== ''Jones'' and beyond ====

Legal histories cite ''[[Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co.]]'' (1968) as a turning point of Thirteen Amendment jurisprudence.<ref name=Tsesis3 /><ref>Colbert, <U+201C>Liberating the Thirteenth Amendment<U+201D> (1995), p. 2.</ref> The Supreme Court confirmed in ''Jones'' that Congress may act <U+201C>rationally<U+201D> to prevent private actors from imposing "badges and incidents of servitude".<ref name=Tsesis3>Tsesis, ''The Thirteenth Amendment and American Freedom'' (2004), p. 3. "After Reconstruction, however, a series of Supreme Court decisions substantially diminished the amendment's significance in achieving genuine liberation. The Court did not revisit the amendment's meaning until 1968, during the heyday of the Civil Rights movement. In ''Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer'', the Court found that the Thirteenth Amendment not only ended unrecompensed, forced labor but that its second section also empowered Congress to develop legislation that is 'rationally' related to ending any remaining 'badges and incidents of servitude'."</ref> The Joneses were a black couple in [[St. Louis County, Missouri]] who sued a real estate company for refusing to sell them a house. The Court held (in a 7<U+2013>2 decision):

<blockquote>Just as the Black Codes, enacted after the Civil War to restrict the free exercise of those rights, were substitutes for the slave system, so the exclusion of Negroes from white communities became a substitute for the Black Codes. And when racial discrimination herds men into ghettos and makes their ability to buy property turn on the color of their skin, then it too is a relic of slavery.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Negro citizens, North and South, who saw in the Thirteenth Amendment a promise of freedom<U+2014>freedom to <U+201C>go and come at pleasure<U+201D> and to <U+201C>buy and sell when they please<U+201D><U+2014>would be left with <U+201C>a mere paper guarantee<U+201D> if Congress were powerless to assure that a dollar in the hands of a Negro will purchase the same thing as a dollar in the hands of a white man. At the very least, the freedom that Congress is empowered to secure under the Thirteenth Amendment includes the freedom to buy whatever a white man can buy, the right to live wherever a white man can live. If Congress cannot say that being a free man means at least this much, then the Thirteenth Amendment made a promise the Nation cannot keep.<ref>Alison Shay, "[https://lcrm.lib.unc.edu/blog/index.php/2012/06/17/remembering-jones-v-alfred-h-mayer-co/ Remembering Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co.]", ''Publishing the Long Civil Rights Movement'', 17 June 2012.</ref></blockquote>

The Court in ''Jones'' reopened the issue of linking racism in contemporary society to the history of slavery in the United States.<ref>Colbert, <U+201C>Liberating the Thirteenth Amendment<U+201D> (1995), pp. 3<U+2013>4.</ref>

The ''Jones'' precedent has been used to justify Congressional action to protect migrant workers and target sex trafficking.<ref>Tsesis, ''The Thirteenth Amendment and American Freedom'' (2004), p. 3. "The Court's holding in ''Jones'' enables Congress to pass statutes against present-day human rights violations, such as the trafficking of foreign workers as sex slaves and the exploitation of migrant agricultural workers as peons."</ref> The direct enforcement power found in the Thirteenth Amendment contrasts with that of the Fourteenth, which allows only responses to institutional discrimination of [[state actor]]s.<ref>Tsesis, ''The Thirteenth Amendment and American Freedom'' (2004), pp. 112<U+2013>113. "... the Thirteenth Amendment remains the principal constitutional source requiring the federal government to protect individual liberties against arbitrary private and public infringements that resemble the incidents of involuntary servitude. Moreover, the Thirteenth Amendment is a positive injunction requiring Congress to pass laws to that end, while the Fourteenth Amendment is 'responsive' to 'unconstitutional behavior.'"</ref>

===Other cases of involuntary servitude===
The Supreme Court has taken an especially narrow view of involuntary servitude claims made by people not descended from black (African) slaves. In ''Robertson v. Baldwin'' (1897), a sailor challenged federal rules mandating the capture and return of deserters. The Court ruled that the "the amendment was not intended to introduce any novel doctrine with respect to certain descriptions  of service which  have always been  treated  as exceptional." In this case, as in numerous <U+201C>badges and incidents<U+201D> cases, Justice Harlan authored a dissent favoring broader Thirteenth Amendment protections.<ref>Wolff, <U+201C>The Thirteenth Amendment and Slavery in the Global Economy<U+201D> (2002), p. 977.</ref>

In ''[[Selective Draft Law Cases]]'',<ref>{{ussc|245|366|1918}}</ref> the Supreme Court ruled that the [[Conscription in the United States|military draft]] was not "involuntary servitude". In ''[[United States v. Kozminski]]'',<ref name="Koz">{{ussc|487|931|1988}}</ref> the Supreme Court ruled that the Thirteenth Amendment did not prohibit compulsion of servitude through psychological coercion.<ref>[http://www.gpoaccess.gov/constitution/html/amdt13.html "Thirteenth Amendment<U+2014>Slavery and Involuntary Servitude"], GPO Access, U.S. Government Printing Office, p. 1557</ref><ref>Risa Goluboff (2001), "The 13th Amendment and the Lost Origins of Civil Rights," ''Duke Law Journal,'' Vol 50, no. 228, p. 1609</ref> ''Kozminski'' limited involuntary servitude to those situations in which "the master subjects the servant to (1) threatened or actual physical force, (2) threatened or actual state-imposed legal coercion, or (3) fraud or deceit where the servant is a minor or an immigrant or is mentally incompetent."<ref name="Koz" />

[[United States courts of appeals|U.S. Courts of Appeals]], in ''[[Immediato v. Rye Neck School District]]'', ''Herndon v. Chapel Hill'', and ''Steirer v. Bethlehem School District'', have ruled that the use of [[community service]] as a high school graduation requirement did not violate the Thirteenth Amendment.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Loupe|first=Diane|date=August 2000|title=Community Service: Mandatory or Voluntary? <U+2013> Industry Overview|journal=School Administrator|page=8|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0JSD/is_7_57/ai_77204744/pg_8/}}</ref>

== Earlier proposed amendments ==
Prior to the Thirteenth Amendment, no [[List of amendments to the United States Constitution|constitutional amendments]] had been adopted in more than 60 years. Two earlier amendments proposed by the Congress would have become the Thirteenth Amendment, but failed to be ratified by a sufficient number of states: the [[Titles of Nobility Amendment]] and the [[Corwin Amendment]].

*The Titles of Nobility Amendment was passed by the Senate on April 26, 1810, and by the House on May 1, 1810, but was ratified only by twelve states. It would have revoked the citizenship of anyone accepting any foreign payment without Congressional authorization or accepting a foreign title of nobility.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|year=2009|title=Titles of Nobility|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of the United States Constitution|publisher=Infobase|last=Mark W.
