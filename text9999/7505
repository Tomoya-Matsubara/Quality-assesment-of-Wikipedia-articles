'''Annie Walke''' or '''Anne Fearon Walke''' (1877 [[Banstead, Surrey]] - 1965 [[Penzance]]) was an English artist.<ref name=Penlee>[http://www.penleehouse.org.uk/artists/anne-walke.html ''Anne Walke''.] Penlee House Museum and Gallery. Retrieved 1 October 2012.</ref><ref name=CA/>{{#tag:ref|Cornwall Artists gives her year of birth as 1877 and her place of birth as [[Banstead, Surrey]]. There are other sources, such as Penlee, that give her year of birth as 1888, but that has to be wrong as she'd be 14 by the time she may have visited her sister in St Ives about 1902.<ref name=CA/>|group=nb}} Anne Fearon grew up and was schooled in [[Banstead, Surrey]]. After completing her studies at the [[Chelsea School of Art]] and the [[City and Guilds of London Art School|London School of Art]], she and her sister, Hilda, furthered their studies in [[Dresden]], Germany. About the turn of the 20th century Miss Fearon settled in Cornwall, where she continued her studies and established a studio in the Cornish coastal village of [[Polruan]]. After she married Nicolo Bernard Walke in 1911, she soon moved with him to [[St Hilary, Cornwall]]. where her husband became the vicar in 1913. She was a member of the [[Newlyn School]] and other artists' organizations and created portraits and religious works for churches. Her work has been exhibited in England, Paris, America and South Africa. In the latter part of her life Walke was a published poet.

==Personal life==
Anne Fearon was born in 1877 in [[Banstead, Surrey]] (just outside what is now the border of [[Greater London]]),<ref name=Penlee/> one of six children born to Edith Jane Duffield Fearon and Paul Bradshaw Fearon, a successful London wine merchant. One of the four girls was a sister named Hilda, also an artist,{{#tag:ref|Hilda studied at the [[Slade School of Fine Art]]. After studying at Slade and in Dresden, Hilda lived in [[St Ives, Cornwall]] from about 1900. There she lived at "The Cabin", currently a rental cottage, and studied under Gertrude and [[Algernon Talmage]]. About or after 1904, she moved to London.<ref name=CA/><ref>[http://www.boutique-retreats.co.uk/luxury-cottages-cornwall/st-ives/the%20cabin-3.html ''The Cabin.''] Boutique Retreats. Retrieved 2 October 2012.</ref>|group=nb}} who was born the year after Anne's birth.<ref name=CA/>

Anne attended the [[Cheltenham Ladies College]], [[Chelsea School of Art]] and the [[City and Guilds of London Art School|London School of Art]]. She exhibited her paintings at the [[Royal Academy]] and other venues in London. Her instructors included Sir [[William Orpen]], [[Augustus John]] and Sir [[William Nicholson (artist)|William Nicholson]]. After Anne and Hilda finished their formal studies in the London area, they travelled together for additional education in [[Dresden]]. Between about 1902 and 1904 she may have joined her sister in [[St Ives, Cornwall]].<ref name=Penlee/><ref name=CA/>

She married [[Bernard Walke|Nicolo Bernard "Ber" Walke]], already an Anglican priest, in 1911 while he was a curate at [[Polruan]] where she had established a studio.<ref>Walke, Bernard (2002) ''Twenty Years at St Hilary''. Mount Hawke: Truran, pp. 5-6, 12, 152</ref> Bernard Walke was appointed [[St Hilary Church, Cornwall|St Hilary Church]]'s vicar in 1912, but not instituted to the living until 1913. He remained vicar until 1936.<ref name=Penlee/><ref name=Pellew>Claughton Pellew; Anne Stevens; Ashmolean Museum. ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=GZhIAQAAIAAJ Claughton Pellew: wood engravings : Ashmolean Museum, Eldon Gallery, 16 September-22 November 1987]''. Ashmolean Museum; September 1987. p. 14.</ref> The couple was described by Newlyn School artist [[Laura Knight]]:
<blockquote>They were both long and thin, and Ber always wore dandy silk socks - he was not in the least like a parson to look at. A man with ideals that he lived up to-he was big - hearted enough to understand anyone and had it in him to enjoy vulgar fun as much as any. After we became intimate we often went to stay with the Walkes at St Hilary, as simple as any monastery in its furnishings.<ref name=CA/></blockquote>

The couple had no children. After Ber retired the couple settled in [[Mevagissey]] at The Battery. Bernard died on 25 June 1941 and was buried in Lelant Churchyard, near St Erth and [[St Hilary, Cornwall|St Hilary]]. Annie Walke remained at their home and continued painting until about 1950. After that, she wrote and had one book published in 1963. Anne Walke died in 1965 and was buried at St Erth.<ref name=CA/><ref name=Pellew/>

==Career==
About 1904 she set up a harbour-facing studio in [[Polruan]], a southern Cornwall coastal town. Over her career she painted murals, figures and portraits. She was a member of the [[Royal Society of Arts|Royal Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce]], [[Newlyn School|Newlyn Society of Artists]] and the St Ives Society of Artists.<ref name=CA/>

In St Hilary Walke fashioned an artist's studio out of a horse's stable, bringing in extra light, wooden floors and an exterior garden. Of her work space it was said:
<blockquote>In this quiet unobtrusive little place, surrounded by tall shrubs, while the famous bells rang over the peaceful garden, the painter meditated and produced quiet-toned pictures of saints and portraits of distinction.<ref>David Tovey; Penlee House Gallery & Museum. ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=EfzkAAAAMAAJ W.H.Y. Titcomb (R.B.A., R.W.A., R.B.C., R.I.): Bristol, Venice and the continental tours : the second part of the biography of William Titcomb dealing with the years 1909-1930 published to coincide with the exhibition, A Newlyner from St Ives, organised by Penlee House Gallery and Museum, Penzance 12th April - 7th June 2003]''. Wilson Books; 11 April 2003. ISBN 978-0-9538363-2-1. p. 182.</ref></blockquote>

==Newlyn School==
[[File:Walter Langley - The Greeting 1904.jpg|thumb|[[Walter Langley]], ''The Greeting'', 1904. Made by another member of the [[Newlyn School]].]]
Walke met Laura Knight at an exhibition in Newlyn, but Annie and Bernard met more individuals from the [[Newlyn School]] through introduction by [[Alfred Munnings]] in 1915.<ref>Melissa Hardie.

ISBN 978-1-85022-192-0.</ref> Because of his close association with area artists, her husband's book ''Twenty years at St Hilary'' is often used to research information about Cornwall artists.<ref name=CA/>

===St Hilary Church commissions===
Although the medieval St Hilary church was rebuilt in 1853, it lacked interior decoration.<ref name=BBC-RBW>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/yourpaintings/paintings/reverend-bernard-walke-and-his-mother-14525 "Reverend Bernard Walke and His Mother."] ''BBC.'' Your Paintings. Retrieved 2 October 2012.</ref> Works by Annie and some of their artist friends, like [[Laura Knight]], [[Dod Procter]], [[Ernest Procter]], [[Harold Harvey (artist)|Harold Harvey]], [[Roger Fry]] and [[Phyllis Yglesias|Phyllis ("Pog") Yglesias]] were commissioned to decorate the church. These artists from the "[[Lamorna]] Group",{{#tag:ref|The Lamorna Group included artists of the Newlyn School in the [[Lamorna]] valley.<ref>[http://www.thelamornasociety.org.uk/Pages/TheArtists.htm ''The Artists.''] Lamorna Society. Retrieved 1 October 2012.</ref>|group=nb}} created [[altar piece]]s, panels and other works.<ref name=Penlee/><ref name=CA/> Among the works were some depicting a number of the [[List of Cornish saints|Cornish saints]].<ref name=BBC-RBW/> 

One of Annie's works for the church was a [[Joan of Arc]] painting that was placed just inside the south door of the church. Ernest Procter made a work that depicts [[St Mawes]], [[St Kevin]] and [[Saint Neot|St Neot]] for the [[pulpit]] and a [[reredos]] of the [[Altar]] of the Dead. Annie, [[Dod Procter|Dod]] and Ernest Procter, [[Gladys Hynes]], Alethea and [[Norman Garstin]] and [[Harold Knight]] all made paintings for the sides of the stalls in the church. Pog Yglesias made the north wall's crucifix and nearby is Roger Fry's reredos. 12 year old Joan Manning Saunders made the painted pictures for a chancel screen.<ref>Melissa Hardie.
