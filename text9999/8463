'''John Robert Wooden''' (born October 14, 1910) is a retired [[United States|American]] [[basketball]] coaching legend.

Wooden has remained devoted to Nellie, even decades after her death. Since her death, he has kept to a monthly ritual (health permitting)<U+2014>on the 21st, he visits her grave, and then writes a love letter to her.

==Coaching career==
===High school===
Wooden coached two years at [[Dayton, Kentucky|Dayton]] High School in [[Kentucky]]. His first year at Dayton marked the only time he had a losing record (6&ndash;11) as a coach.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.coachwooden.com/ |title = The Journey &ndash; A Brief Professional and Personal History Timeline &ndash; 1932 |publisher = CoachWooden.com &ndash; The Official Site of Coach John Wooden |accessdate = 24 January 2010}}</ref> After Dayton, he returned to Indiana, teaching English and coaching basketball at [[South Bend Community School Corporation|South Bend Central High School]]<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.coachwooden.com/ |title = The Journey &ndash; A Brief Professional and Personal History Timeline &ndash; August, 1934 |publisher = CoachWooden.com &ndash; The Official Site of Coach John Wooden |accessdate = 24 January 2010}}</ref> until entering the [[United States Armed Forces|Armed Forces]].<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.coachwooden.com/ |title = The Journey &ndash; A Brief Professional and Personal History Timeline &ndash; 1934 |publisher = CoachWooden.com &ndash; The Official Site of Coach John Wooden |accessdate = 24 January 2010}}</ref> His high school coaching record over 11 years, two at Dayton and nine at Central, was 218&ndash;42.<ref name =UCLABruins/>

===Indiana State University===
After World War II, Wooden coached at Indiana Teacher's College (now named [[Indiana State University]]) in [[Terre Haute, Indiana]], from 1946 to 1948,<ref name="Puma"/> succeeding his high school coach, [[Glenn Curtis]].<ref name="Meyer">{{cite news |url = http://www.indstate.edu/news/news.php?newsid=346 |title = March Madness Flashback: John Wooden |author = Paula Meyer |date = March 30, 2006 |accessdate = 29 January 2010 |publisher = Indiana State University}}</ref> In addition to his duties as basketball coach, Wooden also coached baseball and served as athletic director,<ref name =UCLABruins/><ref name="Puma"/> all while teaching and completing his master's degree in Education.<ref name="Meyer"/><ref name="Benson">{{cite news |url = http://www.pantagraph.com/sports/college/article_4870b765-a6d1-56fe-a7c2-d58009b6df78.html |title = Longtime ISU coach Coughlan to join Wooden in Valley Hall of Fame |author = Jim Benson |publisher = Bloomington Pantagraph |date = October 23, 2008 |accessdate = 28 January 2010}}</ref> In 1947, Wooden's basketball team won the [[Indiana Collegiate Conference]] title and received an invitation to the [[National Association of Intercollegiate Basketball]] (NAIB) National Tournament in Kansas City. Wooden refused the invitation, citing the NAIB's policy banning [[African American]] players.<ref name="Meyer"/><ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.coachwooden.com/ |title = The Journey &ndash; A Brief Professional and Personal History Timeline &ndash; 1946 |publisher = CoachWooden.com &ndash; The Official Site of Coach John Wooden |accessdate = 24 January 2010}}</ref> One of Wooden's players on the team was Clarence Walker, an African-American athlete from [[East Chicago, Indiana]].<ref name="Meyer"/>

That same year, Wooden's alma mater Purdue University wanted him to return to campus and serve as an assistant to then-head coach [[Mel Taube]] until Taube's contract expired.  Then, at that time, Wooden would take over the program.  Citing his loyalty to Taube, Wooden declined, as this would have effectively made Taube a [[Lame duck (politics)|lame-duck]] coach.
 
In 1948, Wooden again led Indiana State to the conference title. The NAIB had reversed its policy banning African-American players that year,<ref name="CW1947">{{cite web |url = http://www.coachwooden.com/ |title = The Journey &ndash; A Brief Professional and Personal History Timeline &ndash; 1947 |publisher = CoachWooden.com &ndash; The Official Site of Coach John Wooden |accessdate = 24 January 2010}}</ref> and Wooden coached his team to the NAIB National Tournament final, losing to [[University of Louisville|Louisville]]. This was the only championship game ever lost by a Wooden-coached team. That year, Walker became the first African-American to play in any post-season intercollegiate basketball tournament.<ref name="CW1947"/> John Wooden was inducted into the Indiana State University Athletic Hall of Fame on February 3, 1984.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.gosycamores.com/ViewArticle.dbml?&DB_OEM_ID=15200&ATCLID=3714314&SPID=7263&SPSID=65182 |title = Hall of Fame |publisher = GoSycamores.com (official site of Indiana State Athletics) |accessdate = 28 January 2010}}</ref>

===UCLA===
After the 1947&ndash;48 season, Wooden became the head coach at UCLA, after negotiating for a three-year contract. UCLA had actually been his second choice for a coaching position in 1948. He had also been pursued for the head coaching position at the [[Minnesota Golden Gophers men's basketball|University of Minnesota]], and it was his and his wife's desire to remain in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]]. But inclement weather in Minnesota prevented Wooden from receiving the scheduled phone offer from the Golden Gophers. Thinking that they had lost interest, Wooden accepted the head coaching job with the Bruins instead. Officials from the University of Minnesota contacted Wooden right after he accepted the position at UCLA, but he declined their offer because he had given his word to the Bruins.<ref name="Puma"/><ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.coachwooden.com/ |title = The Journey &ndash; A Brief Professional and Personal History Timeline &ndash; 1948 |publisher = CoachWooden.com &ndash; The Official Site of Coach John Wooden |accessdate = 24 January 2010}}</ref>

Wooden immediately displayed the rarest quality a coach can effect: "instant turnaround" for an undistinguished, faltering program. In 1948 he took a UCLA team that had a 12&ndash;13 losing season the previous year and transformed it into a [[Pacific Coast Conference|PCC]] Southern Division Champion with a 22&ndash;7 record,<ref name="Puma"/> the most wins for a UCLA season since it started playing basketball in 1919.<ref name="UCLA History">{{cite web |url= http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/ucla/sports/m-baskbl/auto_pdf/MBB_History_99-128.pdf |title = UCLA History |publisher = UCLA |pages = 118&ndash;126 |year = 2007 |accessdate = 29 January 2010}}</ref> He surpassed that number the next season with 24&ndash;7 and a second Southern Division Championship and won a third and fourth straight Southern Division Championship his first four years. Up to that time, UCLA had collected a total of two such championships the previous 30 years. By 1956, he guided UCLA to its first undefeated PCC conference title and 17 straight wins until finally falling to the indomitable USF team lead by [[Bill Russell]] in the NCAA Tournament. 

In spite of success, Wooden reportedly didn't initially enjoy the position and his wife did not favor living in [[Los Angeles]]. As such, once Mel Taube left Purdue in 1950, Wooden's inclination was to return and finally accept the head coaching job there.  He was ultimately dissuaded when UCLA officials reminded him that it was he who insisted upon a three-year commitment during negotiations in 1948. With that in mind, Wooden felt that leaving UCLA prior to the expiration of his contract would be tantamount to breaking his word and thus decided to again pass on the job at Purdue.<ref name ="Reilly2009">{{cite web |author = [[Rick Reilly]] |date= October 19, 2009 |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espnmag/story?id=4557758 |title = Too Short For A Column |publisher = ''[[ESPN The Magazine]]'' |accessdate = 24 January 2010}}</ref>

During his tenure with the Bruins, Wooden became known as the "Wizard of [[Westwood, Los Angeles, California|Westwood]]" (although he personally disdained the nickname)<ref name ="Reilly2009"/> and gained lasting fame with UCLA by winning 620 games in 27 seasons and 10 NCAA titles during his last 12 seasons, including seven in a row from 1967 to 1973.<ref name =UCLABruins/> His UCLA teams also had a record winning streak of 88 games<ref>{{cite news |url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/03/31/AR2006033101991.html |title = A Tradition Lacking Swagger: Storied UCLA Fails to Worry Frisky LSU |author = Mark Schlabach |newspaper = Washington Post |date = April 1, 2006 |accessdate = 7 February 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/print?id=2932885&type=story |title = Trinity squash nears decade with nation's longest winning streak |author = Brendan Murphy |publisher = ESPN |date = July 11, 2007 |accessdate = 7 February 2010}}</ref> and four perfect 30&ndash;0 seasons.<ref name =UCLABruins/> They also won 38 straight games in NCAA Tournaments<ref name =UCLABruins/> and a record 98 straight home game wins at [[Pauley Pavilion]]. Wooden was named NCAA College Basketball's "Coach of the Year" in 1964,1967, 1969, 1970,1971, 1972, 1973, In 1967, he was named the [[Henry Iba Award]] USBWA College Basketball Coach of the Year. In 1973, he received Sports Illustrated magazine's "Sports' Man of the Year" award. Wooden coached his final game in Pauley Pavilion on March 1, 1975, in a 93&ndash;59 victory over [[Stanford Cardinal men's basketball|Stanford]]. Four weeks later he surprisingly announced his retirement following a 75&ndash;74 NCAA semi-final victory, over [[Louisville Cardinals men's basketball|Louisville]] and before his 10th national championship game victory over [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|Kentucky]]. He was named to the Basketball Hall of Fame as a coach in 1973,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hoophall.com/hall-of-famers/tag/john-r-wooden-coach |publisher = Naismith Memorial Hall of Fame |title = John R. Wooden (coach) |accessdate = 24 January 2010}}</ref> becoming the first to be honored as both a player and a coach.<ref name="NBA"/><ref name="Puma"/>

"He never made more than $35,000 a year salary (not including camps and speaking engagements), including 1975, the year he won his 10th national championship, and never asked for a raise," wrote [[Rick Reilly]] of [[ESPN]]. He was given a Bruin powder blue Mercedes that season as a retirement gift <ref>{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espnmag/story? section=magazine&id=3669154 |title = One coach still knows more than all the others combined. And he's been retired for three decades. |author = Rick Reilly |year = 2009 |accessdate = 24 January 2010}}</ref> According to his own writings, Wooden turned down an offer to coach the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] from owner [[Jack Kent Cooke]] that may have been ten times what UCLA was paying him.

In 2009, John R. Wooden was named 
The Sporting News "Greatest Coach of All Time"

==Honors==
Wooden has been recognized numerous times for his achievements. UCLA continues to honor Wooden with the title of Head Men's Basketball Coach [[Emeritus]]<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.directory.ucla.edu/search.php |title =UCLA Directory &ndash; Wooden, John R. |publisher = UCLA |accessdate = 30 January 2010}}</ref> On November 17, 2006, Wooden was recognized for his impact on college basketball as a member of the founding class of the [[National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame]]. He was one of five, along with [[Oscar Robertson]], [[Bill Russell]], [[Dean Smith]] and [[Dr. James Naismith]], selected to represent the inaugural class.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://nabc.cstv.com/sports/m-baskbl/spec-rel/111806aaa.html |title = Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame to induct founding class |publisher = National Association of Basketball Coaches |date = November 17, 2006 |accessdate = 25 January 2010}}</ref> He was inducted into the [[Missouri Valley Conference]] Athletics Hall of Fame in 2009 in St. Louis.

Since 1977, the most coveted of four college basketball player of the year awards has been named the [[John R. Wooden Award]]. This award has attained the status of being the equivalent of football's Heisman Trophy for college basketball, with the winner announced during a ceremony held at the Los Angeles Athletic Club.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.woodenaward.com/?page_id=80 |title = John R.

Bush]] after a three year campaign by Andre McCarter, who was on Wooden's 1975 National Championship team. The Ukleja Center for Ethical Leadership at [[California State University, Long Beach]] established the John Wooden Ethics in Leadership Award in 2009, with Wooden being the inaugural recipient.<ref>{{cite web | title = Ukleja Center Presents Award to Legendary Coach John Wooden  | work = Inside CSULB  | publisher = [[California State University, Long Beach]] | date = June 15, 2009 | url = http://csulb.edu/misc/inside/core/?p=5502  | accessdate = June 15, 2009}}</ref> In 1986 John Wooden was honored as an Outstanding Alumnus of the School of Liberal Arts at Purdue University - the first year the award was given.

==Following Wooden==
Four coaches left UCLA in the nine years following Wooden. One former UCLA head coach, [[ESPN]] analyst [[Steve Lavin]] (fired from UCLA in 2003), has said "The mythology and [[pathology]] of UCLA basketball isn't going to change" due to Wooden's legacy and believes that every basketball coach will eventually be fired or forced out from UCLA.<ref>{{cite news |url = http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/sports/2003/01/12/2003-01-12_trouble_bruin_steve_lavin_fe.html |title = Trouble Bruin: Steve Lavin feels the heat again, but this time it may be too much |author = Dick Weiss |newspaper = New York Daily News |date = January 12, 2003 |accessdate = 30 January 2010}}</ref>

Wooden's immediate successor at UCLA, [[Gene Bartow]], went 28&ndash;5 in 1976, but was blown out twice by eventual national champ Indiana, the second time in the '76 Final Four, and lost 76&ndash;75 in the 1977 West Region semi-finals to [[Idaho State University]] Bartow won 85.2% of his games (compared to Wooden's 80.8%) in two years, yet supposedly received death threats from unsatisfied UCLA [[Fan (aficionado)|fans]].  Wooden himself has often joked about being a victim of his own success, calling his successors on the phone and playfully identifying himself ominously as "we the [[alumni]]..."<ref>{{cite journal |url = http://sports.espn.go.com/espnmag/story?id=3670253 |author = Steve Lavin |coauthor = Chris Snow |title = Coach to Coach: What does John Wooden pass to another coach? |journal = ESPN The Magazine |date = October 5, 2009 |accessdate = 30 January 2010}}</ref> In his autobiography, Wooden recounts walking off the court after his last game coaching in 1975, having just won his tenth title, only to have a UCLA fan walk up and say, "Great win coach, this makes up for letting us down last year" (UCLA had lost in the semi-finals double overtime in 1974)<ref>Wooden, John. ''They Call Me Coach .'' McGraw-Hill, 2004. ISBN 0-07-142491-1</ref>Bartow's successor, Wooden's protege, Gary Cunningham, posted an even better two year record after Bartow, .862 (50-8) and #2 rankings each year, but could not proceed past 2 wins in the NCAA's, and left citing "physical reasons." Larry Brown came next, racking up more losses, 17, in two years than UCLA had experienced the previous 4, yet with a near magical end season run typical of his career, he managed to coach UCLA into the finals of the Final 4 in 1980. He left citing, among other complaints, he couldn't get his office painted. {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} After Brown, UCLA basketball commenced a seven year downward spiral with decidedly cheap, uninspired hirings of near unqualified novices Larry Farmer and former star player Walt Hazzard.  
UCLA went 20 years after Wooden's retirement before winning another national basketball championship, finally hanging a [[Pauley Pavilion#UCLA Championship banners|banner]] again in 1995 under coach [[Jim Harrick]]. In 2006, [[Ben Howland]] led the team back to the national championship game for the first time since the 1995 title game.<ref name ="UCLA History"/>

==Health==

*Make friendship a fine art.

Wooden also has authored a lecture and a book about the Pyramid of Success.<ref>[http://www.woodencourse.com/woodens_wisdom.html The John R. Wooden Course<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  The Pyramid of Success consists of philosophical building blocks for winning at basketball and at life. In his later years  he has been hired by corporations to deliver inspirational lectures and has even appeared in commercials for Hartford Insurance  and the NCAA. It is generally known that he receives lecture fees now that exceed salaries he was paid as a coach. Wooden proudly claims these late in life windfalls have allowed him to set up education accounts for all of his grandchildren. In a 2009 interview, John Wooden described himself politically as a "liberal democrat," who had voted for some  republican presidential candidates."

Wooden is also the author of several other books about basketball and life.
