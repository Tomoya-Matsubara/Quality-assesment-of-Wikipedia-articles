'''Elizabeth II''' (Elizabeth Alexandra Mary; born 21 April 1926{{efn|name=birthday|See [[Queen's Official Birthday]] for an explanation of why her official birthdays are not the same as her real one.}}) is the [[Constitutional monarchy|constitutional monarch]] of 16 [[sovereign state]]s, known as the [[Commonwealth realm]]s, and their territories and dependencies, and head of the 53-member [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. She is [[Supreme Governor of the Church of England]] and, in some of her realms, carries the additional title of [[Fidei defensor|Defender of the Faith]].

Upon her accession on 6 February 1952, Elizabeth became [[Head of the Commonwealth]] and [[queen regnant]] of seven independent Commonwealth countries: the [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Union of South Africa|South Africa]], [[Dominion of Pakistan|Pakistan]] and [[Dominion of Ceylon|Ceylon]]. From 1956 to 1992, the number of her realms varied as territories gained independence and some realms became republics. At present, in addition to the first four of the aforementioned countries, Elizabeth is Queen of [[Jamaica]], [[Barbados]], [[the Bahamas]], [[Grenada]], [[Papua New Guinea]], the [[Solomon Islands]], [[Tuvalu]], [[Saint Lucia]], [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]], [[Belize]], [[Antigua and Barbuda]], and [[Saint Kitts and Nevis]]. Her reign of {{age|1952|2|6}} years is currently the [[List of monarchs in Britain by length of reign#Overall|second longest for a British monarch]]; only [[Queen Victoria]], her great-great grandmother, has reigned longer, at over 63 years.{{Update after|2015|02|07}}

Elizabeth was born in London and educated privately at home. Her father acceded to the throne as [[George VI]] in 1936 on the [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|abdication]] of his brother [[Edward VIII]], from which time she was the [[heir presumptive]]. She began to undertake public duties during the [[World War II|Second World War]], in which she served in the [[Auxiliary Territorial Service]]. In 1947, she married [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark]], with whom she has four children: [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Charles]], [[Anne, Princess Royal|Anne]], [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York|Andrew]], and [[Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex|Edward]]. Her [[Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II|coronation service]] took place in 1953 and was the first to be televised.

Elizabeth II's many historic visits and meetings include a [[Queen Elizabeth II's visit to the Republic of Ireland|state visit to the Republic of Ireland]] and reciprocal visits to and from the [[Pope]].<!--NOTE:"Pope" refers to the Official role, not "a pope". She has met three popes.--> Elizabeth has seen major constitutional changes in her realms, such as [[devolution in the United Kingdom]] and the [[patriation]] of the Canadian constitution. Times of personal significance have included the births and marriages of her children and grandchildren, the [[investiture of the Prince of Wales]], and the celebration of milestones such as her [[Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Silver]], [[Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Golden]], and [[Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Diamond Jubilees]] in 1977, 2002, and 2012, respectively.

Major events in Elizabeth's reign have included [[the Troubles]] in [[Northern Ireland]], the [[Falklands War]], and wars with [[Iraq War|Iraq]] and [[War in Afghanistan (2001<U+2013>present)|in Afghanistan]]. There have been times of personal sorrow for her which include the death of her father at 56, the assassination of Prince Philip's uncle, [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Lord Mountbatten]], the breakdown of her children's marriages in 1992 (a year deemed her ''[[Annus horribilis#Elizabeth II|annus horribilis]]''), the death in 1997 of her son's former wife, [[Diana, Princess of Wales]], and the deaths of her [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|mother]] and [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon|sister]] in 2002. Elizabeth has occasionally faced [[Republicanism in the United Kingdom|republican]] sentiments and severe press criticism of the [[British Royal Family|royal family]], but support for the monarchy and her personal popularity remain high.<!--e.g. Polls cited in "Public perception and character" section below: Ipsos MORI (2006); Populus Ltd (2007); BBC (2007)-->

==Early life==
[[File:Queen Elizabeth II 1929.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Elizabeth as a thoughtful-looking toddler with curly, fair hair|Princess Elizabeth aged 3, 1929]]
Elizabeth is the first child of [[George VI|Prince Albert, Duke of York]] (later King George VI), and his wife, [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Elizabeth, Duchess of York]] (later Queen Elizabeth). Her father was the second son of [[George V|King George V]] and [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]]. Her mother was the youngest daughter of Scottish aristocrat [[Claude Bowes-Lyon, 14th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne]]. She was born by [[Caesarean section]] at 2.40&nbsp;am (GMT) on 21 April 1926 at her maternal grandfather's London house: 17 Bruton Street, [[Mayfair]].<ref>Bradford, p. 22; Brandreth, p. 103; Marr, p. 76; Pimlott, pp. 2<U+2013>3; Lacey, pp. 75<U+2013>76; Roberts, p. 74</ref> She was [[Baptism|baptised]] by the [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] [[Archbishop of York]], [[Cosmo Gordon Lang]], in the private chapel of [[Buckingham Palace]] on 29 May,<ref>Hoey, p. 40</ref>{{efn|name=baptism|Her godparents were: King George V and Queen Mary; Lord Strathmore; [[Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn|Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught]] (her paternal great-granduncle); [[Mary, Princess Royal and Countess of Harewood|Princess Mary, Viscountess Lascelles]] (her paternal aunt); and [[Mary Elphinstone, Lady Elphinstone|Lady Elphinstone]] (her maternal aunt).<ref>Brandreth, p. 103; Hoey, p. 40</ref>}} and named Elizabeth after her mother, Alexandra after [[Alexandra of Denmark|George V's mother]], who had died six months earlier, and Mary after her paternal grandmother.<ref>Brandreth, p. 103</ref> Her close family called her "Lilibet".<ref>Pimlott, p. 12</ref> George V cherished his granddaughter, and during his serious illness in 1929 her regular visits were credited in the popular press and by later biographers with raising his spirits and aiding his recovery.<ref>Lacey, p. 56; Nicolson, p. 433; Pimlott, pp. 14<U+2013>16</ref>

Elizabeth's only sibling, [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon|Princess Margaret]], was four years younger. The two princesses were educated at home under the supervision of their mother and their [[governess]], [[Marion Crawford]], who was casually known as "Crawfie".<ref>Crawford, p. 26; Pimlott, p. 20; Shawcross, p. 21</ref> Lessons concentrated on history, language, literature and music.<ref>Brandreth, p. 124; Lacey, pp. 62<U+2013>63; Pimlott, pp. 24, 69</ref> To the dismay of the royal family,<ref>Brandreth, pp. 108<U+2013>110; Lacey, pp. 159<U+2013>161; Pimlott, pp. 20, 163</ref> in 1950 Crawford published a biography of Elizabeth and Margaret's childhood years entitled ''The Little Princesses''. The book describes Elizabeth's love of horses and dogs, her orderliness and her attitude of responsibility.<ref>Brandreth, pp. 108<U+2013>110</ref> Others echoed such observations: [[Winston Churchill]] described Elizabeth when she was two as "a character. She has an air of authority and reflectiveness astonishing in an infant."<ref>Brandreth, p. 105; Lacey, p. 81; Shawcross, pp. 21<U+2013>22</ref> Her cousin [[Margaret Rhodes]] described her as "a jolly little girl, but fundamentally sensible and well-behaved".<ref>Brandreth, pp. 105<U+2013>106</ref>

==Heiress presumptive==
[[File:Philip Alexius de Laszlo-Princess Elizabeth of York, Currently Queen Elizabeth II of England,1933.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=Elizabeth as a rosy-cheeked young girl with blue eyes and fair hair|Princess Elizabeth aged 7, painted by [[Philip de L<U+00E1>szl<U+00F3>]], 1933]]
During her grandfather's reign, Elizabeth was third in the [[Line of succession to the British throne|line of succession to the throne]], behind her uncle [[Edward VIII|Edward, Prince of Wales]], and her father, the Duke of York. Although her birth generated public interest, she was not expected to become Queen, as the Prince of Wales was still young and many assumed that he would marry and have children of his own.<ref>Bond, p. 8; Lacey, p. 76; Pimlott, p. 3</ref> In 1936, when her grandfather, [[George V]], died and her uncle succeeded as Edward VIII, she became second-in-line to the throne, after her father. Later that year [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|Edward abdicated]], after his proposed marriage to divorced socialite [[Wallis Simpson]] provoked a constitutional crisis.<ref>Lacey, pp. 97<U+2013>98</ref> Consequently, Elizabeth's father became king, and she became [[Heir presumptive|heiress presumptive]]. If her parents had had a later son, she would have lost her position as first-in-line, as her brother would have been [[heir apparent]] and above her in the line of succession.<ref>Marr, pp. 78, 85; Pimlott, pp. 71<U+2013>73</ref>

Elizabeth received private tuition in constitutional history from [[Henry Marten (educator)|Henry Marten]], [[List of Provosts of Eton College|Vice-Provost]] of [[Eton College]],<ref>Brandreth, p. 124; Crawford, p. 85; Lacey, p. 112; Marr, p. 88; Pimlott, p. 51; Shawcross, p. 25</ref> and learned French from a succession of native-speaking governesses.<ref name="Edu">{{cite web|title=Her Majesty The Queen: Education|publisher=Royal Household|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/HMTheQueen/Education/Overview.aspx|accessdate=31 May 2010}}</ref> A [[Girl Guides]] company, the [[Girlguiding London and South East England#1st Buckingham Palace Company|1st Buckingham Palace Company]], was formed specifically so that she could socialise with girls her own age.<ref>Marr, p. 84; Pimlott, p. 47</ref> Later she was enrolled as a [[Ranger (Girl Guide)|Sea Ranger]].<ref name="Edu"/>

In 1939, Elizabeth's parents [[1939 royal tour of Canada|toured Canada and the United States]]. As in 1927, when her parents had toured Australia and New Zealand, Elizabeth remained in Britain, since her father thought her too young to undertake public tours.<ref name=p54>Pimlott, p. 54</ref> Elizabeth "looked tearful" as her parents departed.<ref name=p55>Pimlott, p. 55</ref> They corresponded regularly,<ref name=p55/> and she and her parents made the first royal [[Transatlantic communications cable|transatlantic telephone]] call on 18 May.<ref name=p54/>

===Second World War===
In September 1939, Britain entered the [[World War II|Second World War]], which lasted until 1945. During the war, London was frequently subject to [[aerial bombing of cities|aerial bombardment]], and many of London's children were [[Evacuations of civilians in Britain during World War II|evacuated]]. The suggestion by senior politician [[Douglas Hogg, 1st Viscount Hailsham|Lord Hailsham]]<!--Warwick, Christopher (2002). ''Princess Margaret: A Life of Contrasts''. London: Carlton Publishing Group. ISBN 0-233-05106-6, p. 102--> that the two princesses should be evacuated to Canada was rejected by Elizabeth's mother, who declared, "The children won't go without me. I won't leave without the King. And the King will never leave."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/HistoryoftheMonarchy/The%20House%20of%20Windsor%20from%201952/QueenElizabethTheQueenMother/ActivitiesasQueen.aspx|title=Biography of HM Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother: Activities as Queen|publisher=Royal Household|accessdate=28 July 2009}}</ref> Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret stayed at [[Balmoral Castle]], Scotland, until Christmas 1939, when they moved to [[Sandringham House]], [[Norfolk]].<ref>Crawford, pp. 104<U+2013>114; Pimlott, pp. 56<U+2013>57</ref> From February to May 1940, they lived at [[Royal Lodge]], Windsor, until moving to [[Windsor Castle]], where they lived for most of the next five years.<ref>Crawford, pp. 114<U+2013>119; Pimlott, p. 57</ref> At Windsor, the princesses staged [[pantomime]]s at Christmas in aid of the Queen's Wool Fund, which bought yarn to knit into military garments.<ref>Crawford, pp. 137<U+2013>141</ref> In 1940, the 14-year-old Elizabeth made her first radio broadcast during the [[BBC]]'s ''[[Children's Hour]]'', addressing other children who had been evacuated from the cities.<ref name="CH">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/princesselizabeth/6600.shtml?all=1&id=6600|title=Children's Hour: Princess Elizabeth|publisher=BBC|date=13 October 1940|accessdate=22 July 2009}}</ref> She stated:
{{quote|We are trying to do all we can to help our gallant sailors, soldiers and airmen, and we are trying, too, to bear our share of the danger and sadness of war. We know, every one of us, that in the end all will be well.<ref name="CH" />}}

In 1943, at the age of 16, Elizabeth undertook her first solo public appearance on a visit to the [[Grenadier Guards]], of which she had been appointed [[Colonel-in-Chief]] the previous year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/HMTheQueen/Publiclife/EarlyPublicLife/Earlypubliclife.aspx|title=Early public life|publisher=Royal Household|accessdate=20 April 2010}}</ref> As she approached her 18th birthday, the law was changed so that she could act as one of five [[Counsellor of State|Counsellors of State]] in the event of her father's incapacity or absence abroad, such as his visit to Italy in July 1944.<ref>Pimlott, p. 71</ref> In February 1945, she joined the [[Auxiliary Territorial Service|Women's Auxiliary Territorial Service]], as an honorary Second [[Auxiliary Territorial Service#Ranks|Subaltern]] with the [[service number]] of 230873.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=36973|date=6 March 1945|startpage=1315|supp=yes|accessdate=5 June 2010}}</ref> She trained as a driver and mechanic and was promoted to honorary Junior Commander five months later.<ref>Bradford, p. 45; Lacey, p. 148; Marr, p. 100; Pimlott, p. 75</ref><ref>{{London Gazette|issue=37205|date=31 July 1945|startpage=3972|supp=yes|accessdate=5 June 2010}}</ref>

At the end of the war in Europe, on [[Victory in Europe Day]], the princesses Elizabeth and Margaret mingled anonymously with the celebratory crowds in the streets of London. Elizabeth later said in a rare interview, "We asked my parents if we could go out and see for ourselves. I remember we were terrified of being recognised&nbsp;... I remember lines of unknown people linking arms and walking down [[Whitehall]], all of us just swept along on a tide of happiness and relief."<ref>Bond, p. 10; Pimlott, p. 79</ref>

During the war, plans were drawn up to quell [[Welsh nationalism]] by affiliating Elizabeth more closely with Wales. Proposals, such as appointing her Constable of [[Caernarfon Castle]] or a patron of [[Urdd Gobaith Cymru]] (the Welsh League of Youth), were abandoned for various reasons, which included a fear of associating Elizabeth with [[conscientious objector]]s in the Urdd, at a time when Britain was at war.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/4329001.stm |title=Royal plans to beat nationalism |publisher=BBC News |date=8 March 2005|accessdate=15 June 2010}}</ref> Welsh politicians suggested that she be made [[Prince of Wales|Princess of Wales]] on her 18th birthday. The idea was supported by the [[Home Secretary]], [[Herbert Morrison]], but rejected by the King because he felt such a title belonged solely to the wife of a Prince of Wales, and the Prince of Wales had always been the heir apparent.<ref>Pimlott, pp. 71<U+2013>73</ref> In 1946, she was inducted into the Welsh [[Gorsedd]] of Bards at the [[National Eisteddfod of Wales]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/en/911/|title=Gorsedd of the Bards|publisher=National Museum of Wales|accessdate=17 December 2009}}</ref>

In 1947 Princess Elizabeth went on her first overseas tour, accompanying her parents through southern Africa. During the tour, in a broadcast to the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] on her 21st birthday, she made the following pledge: {{quote|I declare before you all that my whole life, whether it be long or short, shall be devoted to your service and the service of our great imperial family to which we all belong.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/ImagesandBroadcasts/Historic%20speeches%20and%20broadcasts/21stbirthdayspeech21April1947.aspx|title=21st birthday speech|publisher=Royal Household|accessdate=28 July 2009}}</ref>}}

===Marriage===
{{Main|Wedding of Princess Elizabeth and Philip Mountbatten, Duke of Edinburgh}}
Elizabeth met her future husband, [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark]], in 1934 and 1937.<ref>Brandreth, pp. 132<U+2013>139; Lacey, pp. 124<U+2013>125; Pimlott, p. 86</ref> They are [[Cousin#Cousin chart|second cousins once removed]] through King [[Christian IX of Denmark]] and third cousins through [[Queen Victoria]]. After another meeting at the [[Britannia Royal Naval College|Royal Naval College]] in [[Dartmouth, Devon|Dartmouth]] in July 1939, Elizabeth<U+2014>though only 13 years old<U+2014>said she fell in love with Philip and they began to exchange letters.<ref>Bond, p. 10; Brandreth, pp. 132<U+2013>136, 166<U+2013>169; Lacey, pp. 119, 126, 135</ref> Their engagement was officially announced on 9 July 1947.<ref>Heald, p. 77</ref>

The engagement was not without controversy: Philip had no financial standing, was foreign-born (though a British subject who had served in the [[Royal Navy]] during the Second World War), and had sisters who had married German noblemen with [[Nazi Party|Nazi]] links.<ref>{{cite web |author=Edwards, Phil |url= http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/R/real_lives/prince_philip_t.html |title=The Real Prince Philip |publisher=Channel 4|date=31 October 2000|accessdate=23 September 2009}}</ref> Marion Crawford wrote, "Some of the King's advisors did not think him good enough for her. He was a prince without a home or kingdom. Some of the papers played long and loud tunes on the string of Philip's foreign origin."<ref>Crawford, p. 180</ref> Elizabeth's mother was reported, in later biographies, to have opposed the union initially, even dubbing Philip "[[List of terms used for Germans#Hun|The Hun]]".<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1400208/Philip-the-one-constant-through-her-life.html |title=Philip, the one constant through her life |accessdate=23 September 2009 |author=Davies, Caroline |date=20 April 2006 |work=The Telegraph |location=London}}</ref> In later life, however, she told biographer [[Tim Heald]] that Philip was "an English gentleman".<ref>Heald, p. xviii</ref>

Before the marriage, Philip renounced his Greek and Danish titles, converted from [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodoxy]] to [[Anglicanism]], and adopted the style ''Lieutenant Philip Mountbatten'', taking [[Mountbatten|the surname of his mother's British family]].<ref>Hoey, pp. 55<U+2013>56; Pimlott, pp. 101, 137</ref> Just before the wedding, he was created [[Duke of Edinburgh]] and granted the style ''His Royal Highness''.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=38128|startpage=5495|date=21 November 1947|accessdate=27 June 2010}}</ref>

Elizabeth and Philip were married on 20 November 1947 at [[Westminster Abbey]]. They received 2500 wedding gifts from around the world.<ref name="news1">{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/LatestNewsandDiary/Factfiles/60diamondweddinganniversaryfacts.aspx|title=60 Diamond Wedding anniversary facts|publisher=Royal Household|date=18 November 2007|accessdate=20 June 2010}}</ref> Because Britain had not yet completely recovered from the devastation of the war, Elizabeth required [[Rationing in the United Kingdom|ration coupons]] to buy the material for [[Wedding dress of Princess Elizabeth|her gown]], which was designed by [[Norman Hartnell]].<ref>Hoey, p. 58; Pimlott, pp. 133<U+2013>134</ref> In post-war Britain, it was not acceptable for the Duke of Edinburgh's German relations, including his three surviving sisters, to be invited to the wedding.<ref>Hoey, p. 59; Petropoulos, p. 363</ref> The [[Duke of Windsor]], formerly King Edward VIII, was not invited either.<ref>Bradford, p. 61</ref>

Elizabeth gave birth to her first child, [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]], on 14 November 1948. One month earlier, the King had issued [[letters patent]] allowing her children to use the style and title of a royal prince or princess, to which they otherwise would not have been entitled as their father was no longer a royal prince.<ref>Letters Patent, 22 October 1948; Hoey, pp. 69<U+2013>70; Pimlott, pp. 155<U+2013>156</ref> A second child, [[Anne, Princess Royal|Princess Anne]], was born in 1950.<ref>Pimlott, p. 163</ref>

Following their wedding, the couple leased [[Windlesham Moor]], near [[Windsor Castle]], until 4 July 1949,<ref name=news1/> when they took up residence at [[Clarence House]] in London. At various times between 1949 and 1951, the Duke of Edinburgh was stationed in the British [[Crown colony]] of [[Malta Colony|Malta]] as a serving Royal Navy officer. He and Elizabeth lived intermittently, for several months at a time, in the hamlet of [[Gwardaman<U+0121>a]], at Villa Guardamangia, the rented home of Philip's uncle, [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Lord Mountbatten]]. The children remained in Britain.<ref>Brandreth, pp. 226<U+2013>238; Pimlott, pp. 145, 159<U+2013>163, 167</ref>

{{main|Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II}}
During 1951, [[George VI]]'s health declined and Elizabeth frequently stood in for him at public events. When she toured Canada and visited [[President of the United States|President]] [[Harry S.

On 6 February 1952, they had just returned to their Kenyan home, [[Sagana Lodge]], after a night spent at [[Treetops Hotel]], when word arrived of the death of the King. Philip broke the news to the new queen.<ref>Brandreth, pp. 245<U+2013>247; Lacey, p. 166; Pimlott, pp. 173<U+2013>176; Shawcross, p.16</ref> Martin Charteris asked her to choose a [[regnal name]]; she chose to remain Elizabeth, "of course".<ref>Bousfield and Toffoli, p. 72; Charteris quoted in Pimlott, p. 179 and Shawcross, p. 17</ref> She was [[Proclamation of accession of Elizabeth II|proclaimed queen]] throughout her realms and the royal party hastily returned to the United Kingdom.<ref>Pimlott, pp. 178<U+2013>179</ref> She and the Duke of Edinburgh moved into [[Buckingham Palace]].<ref>Pimlott, pp. 186<U+2013>187</ref>

With Elizabeth's accession, it seemed probable that the [[royal house]] would bear her husband's name, becoming the ''House of Mountbatten'', in line with the custom of a wife taking her husband's surname on marriage. [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[Winston Churchill]] and Elizabeth's grandmother, [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]], favoured the retention of the [[House of Windsor]], and so ''Windsor'' it remained. The Duke complained, "I am the only man in the country not allowed to give his name to his own children."<ref>Bradford, p. 80; Brandreth, pp. 253<U+2013>254; Lacey, pp. 172<U+2013>173; Pimlott, pp. 183<U+2013>185</ref> In 1960, after the death of Queen Mary in 1953 and the resignation of Churchill in 1955, the surname ''[[Mountbatten-Windsor]]'' was adopted for Philip and Elizabeth's male-line descendants who do not carry royal titles.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=41948|supp=yes|startpage=1003|date=5 February 1960|accessdate=19 June 2010}}</ref>

{{British Royal Family}}
Amid preparations for [[Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II|the coronation]], [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon|Princess Margaret]] informed her sister that she wished to marry [[Peter Townsend (RAF officer)|Peter Townsend]], a divorcee 16 years Margaret's senior, with two sons from his previous marriage. The Queen asked them to wait for a year; in the words of Martin Charteris, "the Queen was naturally sympathetic towards the Princess, but I think she thought<U+2014>she hoped<U+2014>given time, the affair would peter out."<ref>Brandreth, pp. 269<U+2013>271</ref> Senior politicians were against the match and the [[Church of England]] did not permit re-marriage after divorce. If Margaret contracted a civil marriage, she would be expected to renounce her right of succession.<ref>Brandreth, pp. 269<U+2013>271; Lacey, pp. 193<U+2013>194; Pimlott, pp. 201, 236<U+2013>238</ref> Eventually, she decided to abandon her plans with Townsend.<ref>Bond, p. 22; Brandreth, p. 271; Lacey, p. 194; Pimlott, p. 238; Shawcross, p. 146</ref> In 1960, she married [[Antony Armstrong-Jones, 1st Earl of Snowdon|Antony Armstrong-Jones]], who was created [[Earl of Snowdon]] the following year.

In 1956, [[Prime Minister of France|French Prime Minister]] [[Guy Mollet]] and [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] Sir [[Anthony Eden]] discussed the possibility of France joining the Commonwealth. The proposal was never accepted and the following year France signed the [[Treaty of Rome]], which established the [[European Economic Community]], the precursor of the European Union.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6261885.stm|title=When Britain and France nearly married|publisher=BBC|date=15 January 2007|accessdate=14 December 2009|first=Mike|last=Thomson}}</ref> In November 1956, Britain and France invaded [[Egypt]] in an [[Suez Crisis|ultimately unsuccessful attempt]] to capture the [[Suez Canal]]. Lord Mountbatten claimed the Queen was opposed to the invasion, though Eden denied it. Eden resigned two months later.<ref>Pimlott, p. 255; Roberts, p. 84</ref>

The absence of a formal mechanism within the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] for choosing a leader meant that, following Eden's resignation, it fell to the Queen to decide whom to [[Kissing hands|commission to form a government]]. Eden recommended that she consult [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 5th Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]], the [[Lord President of the Council]]. Lord Salisbury and [[David Maxwell Fyfe, 1st Earl of Kilmuir|Lord Kilmuir]], the [[Lord Chancellor]], consulted the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|British Cabinet]], [[Winston Churchill]], and the Chairman of the backbench [[1922 Committee]], resulting in the Queen appointing their recommended candidate: [[Harold Macmillan]].<ref>Marr, pp. 175<U+2013>176; Pimlott, pp. 256<U+2013>260; Roberts, p. 84</ref>

The Suez crisis and the choice of Eden's successor led in 1957 to the first major personal criticism of the Queen. In a magazine, which he owned and edited,<ref>Lacey, p. 199; Shawcross, p. 75</ref> [[John Grigg, 2nd Baron Altrincham|Lord Altrincham]] accused her of being "out of touch".<ref>Lord Altrincham in ''[[National Review (London)|National Review]]'' quoted by Brandreth, p. 374 and Roberts, p. 83</ref> Altrincham was denounced by public figures and physically attacked by a member of the public appalled by his comments.<ref>Brandreth, p. 374; Pimlott, pp. 280<U+2013>281; Shawcross, p. 76</ref> Six years later, in 1963, Macmillan resigned and advised the Queen to appoint the [[Alec Douglas-Home|Earl of Home]] as prime minister, advice that she followed.<ref name=r84>Hardman, p. 22; Pimlott, pp. 324<U+2013>335; Roberts, p. 84</ref> The Queen again came under criticism for appointing the prime minister on the advice of a small number of ministers or a single minister.<ref name=r84/> In 1965, the Conservatives adopted a formal mechanism for electing a leader, thus relieving her of involvement.<ref>Roberts, p. 84</ref>

In 1957, she made a state visit to the United States, where she addressed the [[United Nations General Assembly]] on behalf of the Commonwealth.

Elizabeth's pregnancies with Princes [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York|Andrew]] and [[Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex|Edward]], in 1959 and 1963, mark the only times she has not performed the [[State Opening of Parliament|State Opening of the British parliament]] during her reign.<ref>{{cite web|author=Dymond, Glenn|date=5 March 2010|url=http://www.parliament.uk/documents/documents/upload/lln2010-007.pdf|title=Ceremonial in the House of Lords|publisher=House of Lords Library|page=12|accessdate=5 June 2010}}</ref> In addition to performing traditional ceremonies, she also instituted new practices. Her first royal walkabout, meeting ordinary members of the public, took place during a tour of Australia and New Zealand in 1970.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/HMTheQueen/Publiclife/PublicLife1962-1971/1962-1971.aspx|title=Public life 1962<U+2013>1971|publisher=Royal Household|accessdate=1 September 2011}}</ref>

The 1960s and 1970s saw an acceleration in the [[Decolonization|decolonisation]] of Africa and the [[Caribbean]]. Over 20 countries gained independence from Britain as part of a planned transition to self-government. In 1965, however, [[Rhodesia]]n Prime Minister [[Ian Smith]], in opposition to moves toward majority rule, [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|declared unilateral independence]] from Britain while still expressing "loyalty and devotion" to Elizabeth. Although the Queen dismissed him in a formal declaration, and the international community applied sanctions against Rhodesia, his regime survived for over a decade.<ref>Bond, p. 66; Pimlott, pp. 345<U+2013>354</ref>

In February 1974, British Prime Minister [[Edward Heath]] advised the Queen to call a [[United Kingdom general election, February 1974|general election]] in the middle of her tour of the [[Austronesia]]n [[Pacific Rim]], requiring her to fly back to Britain.<ref>Bradford, p. 181; Pimlott, p. 418</ref> The election resulted in a hung parliament; Heath's Conservatives were not the largest party, but could stay in office if they formed a coalition with the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberals]]. Heath only resigned when discussions on forming a coalition foundered, after which the Queen asked the [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]], [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour's]] [[Harold Wilson]], to form a government.<ref>Bradford, p. 181; Marr, p. 256; Pimlott, p. 419; Shawcross, pp. 109<U+2013>110</ref>

A year later, at the height of the [[1975 Australian constitutional crisis]], [[Prime Minister of Australia|Australian Prime Minister]] [[Gough Whitlam]] was dismissed from his post by [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]] Sir [[John Kerr (governor-general)|John Kerr]], after the Opposition-controlled [[Australian Senate|Senate]] rejected Whitlam's budget proposals.<ref name=Aus>Bond, p. 96; Marr, p. 257; Pimlott, p. 427; Shawcross, p. 110</ref> As Whitlam had a majority in the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], [[Speaker of the Australian House of Representatives|Speaker]] [[Gordon Scholes]] appealed to the Queen to reverse Kerr's decision. She declined, stating that she would not interfere in decisions reserved by the [[Constitution of Australia]] for the governor-general.<ref>Pimlott, pp. 428<U+2013>429</ref> The crisis fuelled [[Republicanism in Australia|Australian republicanism]].<ref name=Aus/>

===Silver Jubilee===
In 1977, Elizabeth marked the [[Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Silver Jubilee of her accession]]. Parties and events took place throughout the Commonwealth, many coinciding with [[List of events during the Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II|her associated national and Commonwealth tours]]. The celebrations re-affirmed the Queen's popularity, despite virtually coincident negative press coverage of Princess Margaret's separation from her husband.<ref>Pimlott, p. 449</ref> In 1978, the Queen endured a state visit to the United Kingdom by [[Romania]]'s communist dictator, [[Nicolae Ceau<U+0219>escu]], and his wife, [[Elena Ceau<U+0219>escu|Elena]],<ref>Hardman, p. 137; Roberts, pp. 88<U+2013>89; Shawcross, p. 178</ref> though privately she thought they had "blood on their hands".<ref>Elizabeth to her staff, quoted in Shawcross, p. 178</ref> The following year brought two blows: one was the unmasking of [[Anthony Blunt]], former [[Surveyor of the Queen's Pictures]], as a communist spy; the other was the assassination of her relative and in-law [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Lord Mountbatten]] by the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]].<ref>Pimlott, pp. 336<U+2013>337, 470<U+2013>471; Roberts, pp. 88<U+2013>89</ref>

According to [[Paul Joseph James Martin|Paul Martin, Sr.]], by the end of the 1970s the Queen was worried that the Crown "had little meaning for" [[Pierre Trudeau]], the [[Prime Minister of Canada|Canadian Prime Minister]].<ref name=Post/> [[Tony Benn]] said that the Queen found Trudeau "rather disappointing".<ref name=Post>{{cite news |last=Heinricks |first=Geoff |title=Trudeau: A drawer monarchist |work=[[National Post]] |location=Toronto |date=29 September 2000 |page=B12}}</ref> Trudeau's supposed republicanism seemed to be confirmed by his antics, such as sliding down banisters at Buckingham Palace and pirouetting behind the Queen's back in 1977, and the removal of various [[Canadian royal symbols]] during his term of office.<ref name=Post/> In 1980, Canadian politicians sent to London to discuss the [[patriation]] of the [[Constitution of Canada|Canadian constitution]] found the Queen "better informed&nbsp;... than any of the British politicians or bureaucrats".<ref name=Post/> She was particularly interested after the failure of Bill C-60, which would have affected her role as [[head of state]].<ref name=Post/> Patriation removed the role of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British parliament]] from the Canadian constitution, but the monarchy was retained. Trudeau said in his memoirs that the Queen favoured his attempt to reform the constitution and that he was impressed by "the grace she displayed in public" and "the wisdom she showed in private".<ref>Trudeau, p. 313</ref>

===1980s===
[[File:ElizabethIItroopingcolour crop.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Elizabeth in red uniform on a black horse|Elizabeth riding [[Burmese (horse)|Burmese]] at a [[Trooping the Colour]] ceremony]]
During the 1981 [[Trooping the Colour]] ceremony and only six weeks before the [[wedding of Charles, Prince of Wales, and Lady Diana Spencer]], six shots were fired at the Queen from close range as she rode down [[The Mall, London|The Mall]] on her horse, [[Burmese (horse)|Burmese]]. Police later discovered that the shots were blanks. The 17-year-old assailant, [[Marcus Sarjeant]], was sentenced to five years in prison and released after three.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/september/14/newsid_2516000/2516713.stm|title=Queen's 'fantasy assassin' jailed|publisher=BBC|accessdate=21 June 2010|date=14 September 1981}}</ref> The Queen's composure and skill in controlling her mount were widely praised.<ref>Lacey, p. 281; Pimlott, pp. 476<U+2013>477; Shawcross, p. 192</ref> From April to September 1982, the Queen remained anxious<ref>Bond, p. 115; Pimlott, p. 487</ref> but proud<ref>Shawcross, p. 127</ref> of her son, Prince Andrew, who was serving with British forces during the [[Falklands War]]. On 9 July, the Queen awoke in her bedroom at Buckingham Palace to find an intruder, [[Michael Fagan incident|Michael Fagan]], in the room with her. Remaining calm and through two calls to the palace police switchboard, she spoke to Fagan while he sat at the foot of her bed until assistance arrived seven minutes later.<ref>Lacey, pp. 297<U+2013>298; Pimlott, p. 491</ref> Though she hosted US President [[Ronald Reagan]] at Windsor Castle in 1982 and visited [[Rancho del Cielo|his Californian ranch]] in 1983, she was angered when his administration ordered the [[invasion of Grenada]], one of her Caribbean realms, without informing her.<ref>Bond, p. 188; Pimlott, p. 497</ref>

Intense media interest in the opinions and private lives of the royal family during the 1980s led to a series of sensational stories in the press, not all of which were entirely true.<ref>Pimlott, pp. 488<U+2013>490</ref> As [[Kelvin MacKenzie]], editor of ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'', told his staff: "Give me a Sunday for Monday splash on the Royals. Don't worry if it's not true<U+2014>so long as there's not too much of a fuss about it afterwards."<ref>Pimlott, p. 521</ref> Newspaper editor [[Donald Trelford]] wrote in ''[[The Observer]]'' of 21 September 1986: "The royal soap opera has now reached such a pitch of public interest that the boundary between fact and fiction has been lost sight of&nbsp;... it is not just that some papers don't check their facts or accept denials: they don't care if the stories are true or not." It was reported, most notably in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' of 20 July 1986, that the Queen was worried that [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s economic policies fostered social divisions and was alarmed by high unemployment, [[1981 England riots|a series of riots]], the violence of a [[UK miners' strike (1984<U+2013>1985)|miners' strike]], and Thatcher's refusal to apply sanctions against the [[apartheid]] regime in South Africa. The sources of the rumours included royal aide [[Michael Shea (diplomat)|Michael Shea]] and [[Commonwealth Secretary-General]] [[Shridath Ramphal]], but Shea claimed his remarks were taken out of context and embellished by speculation.<ref>Pimlott, pp. 503<U+2013>515; see also Neil, pp. 195<U+2013>207 and Shawcross, pp. 129<U+2013>132</ref> Thatcher reputedly said the Queen would vote for the [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic Party]]<U+2014>Thatcher's political opponents.<ref>Thatcher to [[Brian Walden]] quoted in Neil, p. 207; [[Andrew Neil]] quoted in [[Woodrow Wyatt]]'s diary of 26 October 1990</ref> Thatcher's biographer [[John Campbell (biographer)|John Campbell]] claimed "the report was a piece of journalistic mischief-making".<ref>Campbell, p. 467</ref> Belying reports of acrimony between them, Thatcher later conveyed her personal admiration for the Queen and,<ref>Thatcher, p. 309</ref> after Thatcher's replacement as prime minister by [[John Major]], the Queen gave two honours in her personal gift to Thatcher: appointment to the [[Order of Merit]] and the [[Order of the Garter]].<ref>Roberts, p. 101; Shawcross, p. 139</ref> Former Canadian prime minister [[Brian Mulroney]] said Elizabeth was a "behind the scenes force" in ending [[apartheid in South Africa]].<ref name=Geddes>{{cite journal| last=Geddes| first=John| title=The day she descended into the fray| journal=Maclean's| edition=Special Commemorative Edition: The Diamond Jubilee: Celebrating 60 Remarkable years| year=2012| page=72}}</ref><ref name=MacQueen>{{cite journal| last1=MacQueen| first1=Ken| last2=Treble| first2=Patricia| title=The Jewel in the Crown| journal=Maclean's| edition=Special Commemorative Edition: The Diamond Jubilee: Celebrating 60 Remarkable years| year=2012| pages=43<U+2013>44}}</ref>

In 1987, in Canada, Elizabeth publicly pronounced her support for that country's politically divisive [[Meech Lake Accord]], prompting criticism from opponents of the constitutional amendments, including Pierre Trudeau.<ref name=Geddes /> The same year, the elected [[Fiji]]an government was deposed in [[1987 Fijian coups d'<U+00E9>tat|a military coup]]. Elizabeth, as [[Monarchy of Fiji|monarch of Fiji]], supported the attempts of the [[Governor-General of Fiji|Governor-General]], Ratu Sir [[Penaia Ganilau]], to assert executive power and negotiate a settlement. Coup leader [[Sitiveni Rabuka]] deposed Ganilau and declared Fiji a republic.<ref>Pimlott, pp. 515<U+2013>516</ref> By the start of 1991, republican feeling in Britain had risen because of press estimates of the Queen's private wealth<U+2014>which were contradicted by the palace<U+2014>and reports of affairs and strained marriages among her extended family.<ref>Pimlott, pp. 519<U+2013>534</ref> The involvement of the younger royals in the charity game show ''[[It's a Royal Knockout]]'' was ridiculed<ref>Hardman, p. 81; Lacey, p. 307; Pimlott, pp. 522<U+2013>526</ref> and the Queen was the target of satire.<ref>Lacey, pp. 293<U+2013>294; Pimlott, p. 541</ref>

In 2002, Elizabeth marked her [[Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Golden Jubilee as Queen]]. Her [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon|sister]] and [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|mother]] died in February and March respectively, and the media speculated whether the Jubilee would be a success or a failure.<ref>Bond, p. 156; Bradford, pp. 248<U+2013>249; Marr, pp. 349<U+2013>350</ref> She again undertook an extensive tour of her realms, which began in Jamaica in February, where she called the farewell banquet "memorable" after a power cut plunged the [[King's House, Jamaica|King's House]], the [[official residence]] of the [[Governor-General of Jamaica|governor-general]], into darkness.<ref>Brandreth, p. 31</ref> As in 1977, there were street parties and commemorative events and monuments were named to honour the occasion.

Though generally healthy throughout her life, in 2003 she had [[Laparoscopic surgery|keyhole surgery]] on both knees.

In May 2007, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' newspaper reported claims from unnamed sources that the Queen was "exasperated and frustrated" by the policies of British Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]], that she had shown concern that the [[British Armed Forces]] were overstretched in [[Iraq]] and [[Afghanistan]], and that she had raised concerns over rural and countryside issues with Blair repeatedly.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1552769/Revealed-Queens-dismay-at-Blair-legacy.html|author=Alderson, Andrew|work=The Telegraph|title=Revealed: Queen's dismay at Blair legacy|date=28 May 2007|accessdate=31 May 2010}}</ref> She was, however, said to admire Blair's efforts to achieve peace in [[Northern Ireland]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1552767/Tony-and-Her-Majesty-an-uneasy-relationship.html|author=Alderson, Andrew|work=The Telegraph|title=Tony and Her Majesty: an uneasy relationship|date=27 May 2007|accessdate=31 May 2010}}</ref> On 20 March 2008, at the [[Church of Ireland]] [[St Patrick's Cathedral, Armagh (Church of Ireland)|St Patrick's Cathedral, Armagh]], the Queen attended the first [[Royal Maundy|Maundy service]] held outside England and Wales.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/7305675.stm |title=Historic first for Maundy service|publisher=BBC|date=20 March 2008|accessdate=12 October 2008}}</ref> At the invitation of Irish President [[Mary McAleese]], the Queen  made the first [[Queen Elizabeth II's visit to the Republic of Ireland|state visit to the Republic of Ireland]] by a British monarch in May 2011.<ref>Bradford, p. 253</ref>

Elizabeth was admitted on 3 March 2013 to the [[King Edward VII's Hospital Sister Agnes|King Edward VII Hospital]] for assessment as a precaution after developing symptoms of [[gastroenteritis]].

==Titles, styles, honours and arms==

===Titles and styles===
{{Main|List of titles and honours of Queen Elizabeth II}}

Elizabeth has held many titles and honorary military positions throughout the Commonwealth, is Sovereign of many orders in her own countries, and has received honours and awards from around the world. In each of her realms she has a distinct title that follows a similar formula: ''Queen of Jamaica and her other realms and territories'' in Jamaica, ''Queen of Australia and her other realms and territories'' in Australia, etc. In the [[Channel Islands]] and [[Isle of Man]], which are [[Crown dependencies]] rather than separate realms, she is known as [[Duke of Normandy]] and [[Lord of Mann]], respectively. Additional styles include [[Fidei defensor|Defender of the Faith]] and [[Duke of Lancaster]]. When in conversation with the Queen, the practice is to initially address her as ''Your Majesty'' and thereafter as ''Ma'am''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/ThecurrentRoyalFamily/GreetingamemberofTheRoyalFamily/Overview.aspx|title=Greeting a member of The Royal Family|publisher=Royal Household|accessdate=21 August 2009}}</ref>
