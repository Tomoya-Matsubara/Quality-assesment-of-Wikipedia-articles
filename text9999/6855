==Early political career==
{{expandsection}}
"A trained economist, Van Rompuy worked at the Belgian central bank from 1972 to 1975 before going into politics, where he had stints in government in the 1980s and 1990s. As budget minister, he helped drive down Belgium<U+2019>s debt from a peak of 135 percent of gross domestic product in 1993. It fell to below 100 percent of GDP in 2003." <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601085&sid=alqnA74CDu4U|title=Bloomberg record on debt reduction of the Belgium's debt in the 90's and early 00's.|accessdate=2009-11-20}}</ref>

Van Rompuy was the Vice President of the CVP Youth from 1973 to 1975, from 1978 onward, he was a member of the National Bureau of the CVP, from 1975 to 1980 he worked in the ministerial cabinets of [[Leo Tindemans]] and [[Gaston Geens]] and from 1988 to 1993 he was the President of the CVP. He also was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Budget from September 1993 to July 1999. After his party's defeat in the [[Belgian general election, 1999|1999 Belgian general election]], he became a member of the [[Belgian Chamber of Representatives|Chamber of Representatives]]. In 2004, he was designated [[Crown Council of Belgium|Minister of State]].



==Prime Minister==
{{Main|Van Rompuy I Government}}

On 12 July 2007, Van Rompuy was elected as the [[List of Presidents of the Belgian Chamber of Representatives|President of the Belgian Chamber of Representatives]].

On 28 December 2008, following the [[2007<U+2013>2008 Belgian political crisis]], Van Rompuy was asked by [[Albert II of Belgium|King Albert II]] to form a new government<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/rbssFinancialServicesAndRealEstateNews/idUSLS35202520081228|title= UPDATE 2-Belgian king asks Van Rompuy to form government - Industries - Financial Services & Real Estate - Reuters |accessdate=2009-11-20}}</ref> after he was reluctant to take up the role of Prime Minister<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUKTRE4BT3N020081230|title= FACTBOX - Key facts about new Belgian prime minister - World - Reuters |accessdate=2009-11-20}}</ref>. He was sworn in as Belgian Prime Minister on 30 December 2008.

===Taxes===
On 13 October 2009 Bloomberg reported that the government of Herman Van Rompuy would seek to "Tax Banks, Nuclear Power to Tame Deficit".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601085&sid=aWc3BM6JABEo|title=Bloomberg Aricle on Van Rompuy's positions as PM|accessdate=2009-11-20}}</ref> The article included the following information, "Belgium will introduce levies on banks, life insurers and nuclear-power producers next year as Prime Minister Herman Van Rompuy seeks to start taming a swelling debt burden without hampering the economic recovery.  The government will seek 670 million euros ($991 million) from banks and life insurers in 2011 to protect their depositors and policy holders from default, Finance Minister [[Didier Reynders]] said. Power producers [[GDF Suez|GDF Suez SA]] and SPE NV will have to pay as much as 245 million euros annually for keeping the country<U+2019>s three oldest nuclear plants in operation for an additional 10 years, according to Energy Minister Paul Magnette.  Van Rompuy<U+2019>s government is seeking additional revenue from energy producers and financial companies, some of which received government aid last year, to fund a stimulus package of value- added-tax discounts on construction works and eating out, pinning its hopes on consumers to lead the recovery. The Belgian government projects the economy will expand 0.4 percent next year and 1.9 percent in 2011.

===Quote on financial recovery===
<U+201C>We are in the early stages of a recovery and at this time it is important not to weaken burgeoning confidence and to lay the foundations of a sustainable recovery,<U+201D> Van Rompuy said in a speech to Parliament today in Brussels. <U+201C>Most important is to keep the direction. That will also provide stability and support.<U+201D>  As reported by Bloomberg on 13 October 2009.{{fact}}

===Policy on government debt===
On 13 October Bloomberg reported the following about Van Rompuy's Government Debt Policy: "Belgium will trim its budget deficit to 5.3 percent of gross domestic product in 2011 from almost 5.7 percent both this year and next, according to a slide presentation handed out by State Secretary for the Budget Melchior Wathelet. Van Rompuy told Parliament earlier today that the deficit would widen to 5.4 percent of GDP this year.  Belgium<U+2019>s deficit will be little changed next year as the shortfall at the level of regional governments and municipalities will widen to 1.5 percent of GDP from 0.7 percent, offsetting efforts by the federal government to trim its deficit.  Government debt will start exceeding one year<U+2019>s worth of national output as of 2010, according to European Commission forecasts. Belgium had trimmed debt to as little as 84 percent of GDP in 2007, before bailouts of Fortis, Dexia SA, KBC Group NV and mutual insurer Ethias Group increased the nation<U+2019>s borrowing costs and inflated the debt ratio to 89.6 percent at the end of last year."{{fact}}

===Negotiations and dispute with GDF Suez===
On 22 October 2009 Reuters reported that the Van Rompuy Government had signed a commitment with GDF Suez for nuclear power fees to Belgium.  The outstanding dispute with GDF concerns the <U+20AC>250 million fee that Belgium is attempting to charge GDF for 2009 as part of its "Renewable Energy Fund"  as stated in the article: "Belgium has also charged nuclear producers a total of 250 million euros for 2008 and the same for 2009, as well as 250 million euros this year payable to a renewable energy fund. These fees remain in dispute.  The producers are challenging the 2008 payment in Belgium's constitutional court.  A spokesman for Van Rompuy said the government would pass a law to enforce the 500 million euro charge for this year, adding that this could also be contested by GDF Suez." <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/utilitiesSector/idUSLM64184620091022|title= UPDATE 1-GDF Suez signs Belgian nuclear commitment - Reuters |accessdate=2009-11-20}}</ref>

===Position on Turkey joining the European Union===
Van Rompuy is a strong opponent of [[Turkey]] joining the European Union. In 2004, he stated ''"Turkey is not a part of Europe and will never be part of Europe. An expansion of the EU to include Turkey cannot be considered as just another expansion as in the past"''. He continued ''"The universal values which are in force in Europe, and which are fundamental values of Christianity, will lose vigour with the entry of a large Islamic country such as Turkey."''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/eu/6600570/EU-president-Herman-Van-Rompuy-opposes-Turkey-joining.html |title=EU president: Herman Van Rompuy opposes Turkey joining |accessdate=19 November 2009 |date=19 November 2009 | publisher=Daily Telegraph}}</ref>

===Stabilization===
As reported by Bloomberg: "Van Rompuy brought political stability to Belgium after taking over in December 2008, ending a year when the country went through three prime ministers and speculation was rife that [[Partition of Belgium|it might split apart]]."  <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601085&sid=alqnA74CDu4U|title=Quote on Van Rompuy's role in the Stabilization of Belgian Politics|accessdate=2009-11-20}}</ref>

==President designate of the European Council==
{{wikinews|Herman van Rompuy named as first permanent EU President}}
On 19 November 2009, Van Rompuy was chosen to be appointed as the first full-time [[President of the European Council]] as soon as the position becomes available in accordance with the [[Treaty of Lisbon]]. [[Gordon Brown]] said that he had unanimous backing from the 27 EU leaders at the summit in Brussels on the evening of 19 November 2009. Brown also praised Van Rompuy as "a consensus builder" who had "brought a period of political stability to his country after months of uncertainty".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8367589.stm|title=BBC News - Belgian PM Van Rompuy is named as new EU president|accessdate=2009-11-20}}</ref>

At a press conference after his election, Van Rompuy commented: 
{{cquote2|''Every country should emerge victorious from negotiations. A negotiation that ends with a defeated party is never a good negotiation. I will consider everyone's interests and sensitivities. Even if our unity remains our strength, our diversity remains our wealth"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nation-and-world/la-fg-eu-president20-2009nov20,0,7505745.story|title=European Union settles on a Belgian and a Briton for top posts -- latimes.com|accessdate=2009-11-20}}</ref>''}}
