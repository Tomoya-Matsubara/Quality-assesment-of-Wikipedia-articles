'''Honor<U+00E9> Gabriel Riqueti, Comte de Mirabeau''' (March 9, 1749 &ndash; 2 April 1791) was a  French revolutionary, as well as a writer, diplomat, freemason, journalist and French politician at the same time. He was a popular orator and statesman. During the [[French Revolution]], he was a [[moderate]], favoring a [[constitutional monarchy]] built on the model of [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]]. He unsuccessfully conducted secret negotiations with the French monarchy in an effort to reconcile it with the Revolution.

==Family history==
The family of Riqueti (sometimes spelled Riquet), originally of the small town of [[Seyne]] (but the family has its distant origins in Italy), became wealthy through [[merchant]] trading in [[Marseilles]]. In 1570, Jean Riqueti bought the ch<U+00E2>teau and seigniory of Mirabeau, which had belonged to the great [[Provence|Proven<U+00E7>al]] family of [[Barras]]. In 1685, Honor<U+00E9> Riqueti obtained the title ''marquis de Mirabeau''. He died in 1737.

His son, Jean Antoine, grandfather of Honor<U+00E9> Gabriel Riqueti, served with distinction through all the later campaigns of the reign of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]]. At the [[Battle of Cassano (1705)|Battle of Cassano]] (1705), he suffered a neck wound so severe he thereafter had to wear a [[silver stock]]. Because he tended to be blunt and tactless, he never rose above the rank of colonel. On retiring from the service, he married Fran<U+00E7>oise de Castellane with whom he had three sons: Victor (marquis de Mirabeau), Jean Antoine (bailli de Mirabeau) and Louis Alexandre (Comte de Mirabeau). Honor<U+00E9> Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau was the son of Victor.

==Early life==
Honor<U+00E9> Mirabeau was born at [[Le Bignon-Mirabeau|Le Bignon]], near [[Nemours]], the eldest surviving son of the economist [[Victor de Riqueti, marquis de Mirabeau]] and his wife Marie-Genevi<U+00E8>ve de Vassan. He was also the fifth child and second son of the couple. When he was three years old, a virulent attack of [[smallpox]] left his face disfigured. This, combined with Mirabeau's resemblance to his maternal ancestors and his fondness for his mother, contributed to his father's dislike of him <ref name="tyom">{{cite journal

Destined for the army, at age eighteen, he was entered at military boarding school in Paris in the regiment of Berri-Cavaleria at Saints.<ref>Beraud, Henri. ''Twelve Portraits of the French Revolution.'' (Books For Libraries Press Inc, 1968):5. </ref> Of this school, which had [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]] for its professor of mathematics, there is an amusing account in the life of [[Gilbert Elliot-Murray-Kynynmound, 1st Earl of Minto|Gilbert Elliot]] who met Mirabeau there. On leaving school in 1767 he received a commission in a [[cavalry]] regiment which his grandfather had commanded years before. 

Mirabeau's love affairs are well-known, owing to the celebrity of the letters to "Sophie". In spite of his ugliness, he won the heart of the lady to whom his colonel was attached; this led to such scandal that his father obtained a ''[[lettre de cachet]]'', and Mirabeau was imprisoned in the [[Ile de R<U+00E9>]]. On being released, the young count obtained leave to accompany the French expedition to [[Corsica]] as a volunteer. During the Corsican expedition, Mirabeau contracted several more gambling debts and engaged in another scandalous love affair. However, he proved his military genius in the Corsican expedition, and also conducted a thorough study of the island during his stay. The study was most likely very factually incorrect, but his desire to learn of a country that had been previously unstudied emphasizes Mirabeau<U+2019>s endless curiosity and inquisitiveness, particularly into the traditions and customs of society.  The French Army is where Mirabeau learned the value of hard work. This aspect of Mirabeau<U+2019>s personality contributed to his popular success in the later years of the Revolution.<ref name="tyom"/><!-- Might be a good idea to separate the pages though. --> After his return, he tried to keep on good terms with his father, and in 1772 he married a rich heiress, Marie-Marquerite-Emilie de Covet, daughter of the marquess de [[Marignane]]. Emilie, who was 18 years old, was apparently engaged to a much older nobleman, the Comte the Valbelle. Nonetheless, Mirabeau pursued her for several months expecting that his marriage to her would benefit him from the allowance that the couple would received from their parents. After several months of failed attempts at being introduced to the heiress, Mirabeau bribed one of the marquess's maids to let him into their residence, where he pretended to have had a sexual encounter with Emilie. To avoid losing face, her father saw that they got married just a couple of days after that incident. Mirabeau received a small allowance of 6,000 [[French livre|livre]]s from his father and never received the expected 3,000 livres allowance from the marquess. 

Mirabeau, who was still facing financial trouble and increasing debt, could not keep up with the expensive lifestyle his wife was used to and their extravagances forced his father to send him into semi-exile in the country, where he wrote his earliest extant work, the ''[[Essai sur le despotisme]]''. The couple had a son who died early, mostly due to the poor living conditions they experienced during that time. Then the marquess asked for judicial separation in 1782. She was defended by Jean <U+00C9>tienne Mary Portalis, who will become later one of the editor of the Civil code. Mirabeau defended his own cause in this trial which he lost ,holding resentment  against Portalis forever

His violent disposition led him to quarrel with a country gentleman who had insulted his sister, and his exile was changed by ''lettre de cachet'' into imprisonment in the [[Ch<U+00E2>teau d'If]] in 1774. In 1775 he was transferred to the [[Fort de Joux|castle of Joux]], where he was not closely confined, having full leave to enter the town of [[Pontarlier]]. In a house of a friend he met Marie Th<U+00E9>r<U+00E8>se de Monnier, his "Sophie", and the two fell in love. He escaped to Switzerland, where Sophie joined him; they then went to the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]], where he lived by [[hack writer|hack work]] for the booksellers; meanwhile Mirabeau had been condemned to death at Pontarlier for seduction and abduction, and in May 1777 he was seized by the Dutch police, sent to France and imprisoned by a ''lettre de cachet'' in the castle of [[Ch<U+00E2>teau de Vincennes|Vincennes]].

The early part of his confinement is marked by the indecent letters to Sophie (first published in 1793), and the obscene ''Erotica biblion'' and ''Ma conversion''. In Vincennes, he met the [[Marquis de Sade]], who was also writing erotic works; however the two disliked each other intensely.<ref>{{cite book

}}</ref>  It was in these writings, however, that Mirabeau developed experience as an orator.  He learned how to curb his natural eloquence, his dialectic become firmer, commanding and moving.  The prison in which he was held in was the first platform to hear his voice.<ref>Beraud, Henri. ''Twelve Portraits of the French Revolution.'' New York: Books for

</ref> Later during his confinement, he wrote ''[[Des Lettres de Cachet et des prisons d'<U+00E9>tat]]'', published after his liberation (1782). It exhibits an accurate knowledge of French constitutional history skillfully applied in an attempt to show that the system of ''[[lettres de cachet]]'' was not only philosophically unjust but also constitutionally illegal. It shows, though in a rather diffuse and declamatory form, the application of wide historical knowledge, keen philosophical perception, and genuine eloquence to a practical purpose which was the great characteristic of Mirabeau, both as a political thinker and as a statesman.

==Before the French Revolution==
His release from Vincennes (August 1782) began the second period of Mirabeau's life. Mirabeau not only succeeded in reversing the sentence of death against him but also got an order for M. de Monnier to pay the costs of the whole law proceedings. It was thought Mirabeau would come out of the lawsuit in Aix ruined:  his past convictions in prison, scandalous relationships with woman, and the bad relationship with his father Marquis, all caused a terrible reputation among judges and adversaries.  However, despite being condemned by the judge, his reputation was greatly enhanced in the eyes of the public.  He had withered his opponents, crushed the opposing lawyer and turned the cards in his favor regarding the death sentence, and it was from this day forward Mirabeau became a man of the people.<ref>Beraud, Henri. ''Twelve Portraits of the French Revolution'' (Books for Libraries Press Inc: New York): 9.</ref> Upon his release, he found that his Sophie had consoled herself with a young officer, after whose death she had committed [[suicide]]. From Pontarlier he went to [[Aix-en-Provence]], where he claimed the court's order said that his wife should return to him. She naturally objected, and he finally lost in the third appeal of the case when Emilie's father produced to the court compromising letters from Mirabeau addressed to the marquess. Mirabeau then intervened in the suit between his father and mother before the [[parlement]] of Paris, and attacked the ruling powers so violently that he had to leave France and return to [[Holland]], where he tried to live by writing.

About this time he met Mme de Nehra, the daughter of [[Willem van Haren]], a Dutch statesman and political writer. She was an educated, refined woman, capable of appreciating Mirabeau's good points. His life was strengthened by the love of Mme de Nehra, his adopted son, Lucas de Montigny, and his little dog Chico.  After a time in Holland he went to England, where his treatise on ''lettres de cachet'' had been much admired, being translated into English in 1787, and where he was soon admitted into the best [[British Whig Party|Whig]] literary and political society of London, through his old school friend [[Gilbert Elliot]], who had become a leading Whig member of parliament. Of all his English friends none seem to have been as close as [[William Petty, 2nd Earl of Shelburne|Lord Shelburne]] and Sir [[Samuel Romilly]]. Romilly was introduced to Mirabeau by [[Sir Francis D'Ivernois]] (1757-1842), and undertook the translation of Mirabeau's the ''Consid<U+00E9>rations sur [[Society of the Cincinnati|l'ordre de Cincinnatus]]'' into English.

It was the only important work Mirabeau wrote in the year 1785, and it is a good specimen of his method. He had read a pamphlet published in America attacking the proposed order, which sought to form a bond of association between the officers who had fought in the [[American Revolutionary War]] against Britain; the arguments struck him as true and valuable, so he re-arranged them in his own fashion, and rewrote them in his own oratorical style.

He soon found such work did not pay enough to keep his retinue, and sought employment from the French foreign office, either as a writer or a diplomat. He first sent Mme de Nehra to Paris to make peace with the authorities, and then returned himself, hoping to get a job through an old literary collaborateur of his, Durival, at this time director of finance at the department of foreign affairs. One of this official's functions was to subsidize political pamphleteers, and Mirabeau hoped to be so employed. However, he ruined his chances by a series of writings on financial questions.

On his return to Paris he had become acquainted with [[<U+00C9>tienne Clavi<U+00E8>re]], the Genevese exile, and a banker named Panchaud. From them he learnt about the abuse of stock-jobbing, and seizing their ideas he began to regard [[Arbitrage|stock-jobbing]], or ''agiotage'', as the source of all evil, and to attack in his usual vehement style the [[Banque de St-Charles]] and the [[Compagnie des Eaux]]. This pamphlet brought him into controversy with [[Pierre Beaumarchais|Caron de Beaumarchais]], who certainly did not get the best of it, but it lost him any chance of employment with the government.

However, his ability was too great to be overlooked by the foreign minister, [[Charles Gravier, Comte de Vergennes]].  After a preliminary trip to Berlin in early 1786, he was despatched that July on a mission to the royal court of [[Prussia]]; returning in January, Mirabeau published a full account in his ''Secret History of the Court of Berlin'' (1787).<ref>{{cite book |title=The Oxford History of the French Revolution |last=Doyle |first=William |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2002 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford, UK |isbn=9780199252985 |page=97 |url= |accessdate=}}</ref> This account denounced the Prussian court as scandalous and corrupt, described the King of Prussia as weak and over-emotional, and labeled Prince Henry of Prussia, brother of Frederick the Great and a guest of the French court, as narrow-minded and incompetent. The resulting uproar was an extreme embarrassment for the French government which quickly censored the book but could not prevent its widespread notoriety. Mirabeau's episode provided inspiration to many more radical publishers who came to regard Mirabeau as a leader of the coming revolution.<ref>

During his journey he had made the acquaintance of [[Jakob Mauvillon]], an expert on Prussia; Mirabeau made use of his expertise in his ''[[De la monarchie prussienne sous Fr<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ric le Grand]]'' (London, 1788).  While this book gave him a good reputation as a historian, in the same year he lost a chance of political employment. He had offered himself as a candidate for secretary to the Assembly of Notables which the King [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] had just convened.  To bring his name before the public, he published another financial work, the ''[[D<U+00E9>nonciation de l'agiotage]]'', which contained such violent diatribes that he not only lost his election but also was obliged to retire to [[Tongeren]]. He further injured his prospects by publishing the reports he had sent in during his secret mission at Berlin. But 1789 was at hand; the [[French States-General|Estates-General]] was summoned; Mirabeau's period of probation was over.

==During the Revolution==
[[Image:Mirabeau on Terrace.jpg|thumb|Sketch of Mirabeau on a terrace]]
On hearing of the king's decision to summon the [[Estates-General of 1789|Estates-General]], Mirabeau went to [[Provence]], and offered to assist at the preliminary conference of the nobility of his district, but was rejected. He appealed to the [[Third Estate]] and was elected to the Estates in both [[Aix-en-Provence|Aix]] and [[Marseilles]]. He chose to accept the seat for the former city, and was present at the opening of the Estates-General on 4 May 1789. From this time the record of Mirabeau's life forms the best history of the first two years of the [[National Constituent Assembly]]. Among a large crowd of unfamiliar politicians in the Estates General, Mirabeau was one figure who stood out. He was famous and not only did the people place great faith in him, but they feared him.  His great capacity for work and extensive knowledge were easily seen, but the scandals of his private life with woman, time in prison and extensive debt were all well known.<ref>Beraud, Henri ''Twelve Portraits of the Revolution'' (New York: Books for Libraries Press, Inc): 14.</ref> At every important crisis his voice was heard, though his advice was not always followed. He possessed both logical acuteness and passionate enthusiasm.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} From the beginning he recognized that government exists in order for the population to pursue its daily work in peace, and that for a government to be successful it must be strong.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

At the same time he thoroughly understood that for a government to be strong, it must be in harmony with the wishes of the majority of the people.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} He had studied the British system of government, and he hoped to establish in France a system similar in principle but without slavish imitation. In the first stage of the Estates-General, Mirabeau was very important. He was soon recognized as a leader, to the chagrin of [[Jean Joseph Mounier]], because he always knew his own mind, and was prompt in emergencies. He is attributed with the successful consolidation of the [[National Assembly]].

After the [[storming of the Bastille]], he warned the Assembly of the futility of passing fine-sounding decrees and urged the necessity of action. Even though the cause of liberty had triumphed, Mirabeau had foreseen the danger of the intervention of an armed mob would only drive the path of Revolution further and further along a destructible path of violence. <ref> Quastana, Francois. <U+201C>Politics of Mirabeau 1771-1789.<U+201D> Oxford University Press (January 
13, 2010):4. 
</ref> He declared that the night of 4 August was but an orgy, giving the people immense theoretical liberty while not assisting them to practical freedom, overthrowing the old r<U+00E9>gime before a new one could be constituted. His failure to control the theorizers showed Mirabeau, after the removal of the king and the Assembly to Paris, that his eloquence would not enable him to guide the Assembly by himself, and that he must get additional support. He wished to establish a strong ministry, which should be responsible like an English ministry, but to an assembly chosen to represent the people of France better than the [[British House of Commons]] at that time represented Great Britain.

He first thought of becoming a minister at a very early date, if we may believe a story contained in the ''M<U+00E9>moires of the duchesse d'Abrantes'', to the effect that in May 1789 Queen [[Marie Antoinette of Austria|Marie Antoinette]] tried to bribe him, but that he refused this and expressed his wish to be a minister. The indignation with which the queen repelled the idea may have made him think of the [[Louis Philippe Joseph, duc d'Orl<U+00E9>ans|Duke of Orl<U+00E9>ans]] as a possible constitutional king, because his title would of necessity be parliamentary. But the weakness of the Duke of Orl<U+00E9>ans was too palpable, and in a famous remark Mirabeau expressed his utter contempt for him.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} He also attempted to form an alliance with [[Marquis de la Fayette|Lafayette]], but the two could not agree on a personal level {{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}, and Lafayette had his own theories about a new French constitution. Mirabeau tried for a time to act with [[Jacques Necker|Necker]], and obtained the sanction of the Assembly to Necker's financial scheme, not because it was good, but because, as he said, "no other plan was before them, and something must be done."{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

The [[Auguste Marie Raymond, Prince d'Arenberg, Comte de la Marck|Comte de la Marck]] was a close friend of the queen, and had been elected a member of the Estates-General. His acquaintance with Mirabeau, begun in 1788, ripened during the following year into a friendship, which La Marck hoped to turn to the advantage of the court. After [[The March on Versailles|the march on Versailles]] he consulted Mirabeau as to what measures the king ought to take, and Mirabeau, delighted at the opportunity, drew up an admirable state paper, which was presented to the king by Monsieur, afterwards [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]]. 

This M<U+00E9>moire gives insight into Mirabeau's genius for politics: The main position was that the king is not free in Paris; he must therefore leave Paris towards the interior of France to a provincial capital, best of all to [[Rouen]], and there he must appeal to the people and summon a great convention. It would be ruin to appeal to the nobility, as the queen advised. When this great convention met the king must show himself ready to recognize that great changes have taken place, that [[feudalism]] and [[political absolutism|absolutism]] have for ever disappeared, and that a new relationship between king and people has arisen, which must be loyally observed on both sides for the future. To establish this new constitutional position between king and people would not be difficult, because the indivisibility of the monarch and his people is anchored in the heart of the French people.

This was Mirabeau's programme{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}, from which he never diverged, but which was far too statesmanlike to be understood by the king, and far too positive regarding the altered condition of the monarchy to be palatable to the queen. Mirabeau followed up his ''M<U+00E9>moire'' by a scheme of a great ministry to contain all men of mark; Necker as prime minister, "to render him as powerless as he is incapable, and yet preserve his popularity for the king", the duc de Liancourt, the [[Fran<U+00E7>ois Alexandre Fr<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ric, duc de la Rochefoucauld-Liancourt|Duc de la Rochefoucauld]], La Marck, [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand|Talleyrand]], [[Bishop of Autun]], Mirabeau without portfolio, [[Gui-Jean-Baptiste Target|Target]], mayor of Paris, Lafayette generalissimo of the army, Louis Philippe, comte de S<U+00E9>gur as foreign minister, Mounier and [[Isaac Ren<U+00E9> Guy le Chapelier|le Chapelier]].

This scheme got noised abroad, and was ruined by a decree of the Assembly of 7 November 1789, that no member of the Assembly could become a minister; this decree destroyed any chance of harmony between ministers and parliament which existed in England, and so at once overthrew Mirabeau's hopes. The queen utterly refused to take Mirabeau's counsel saying "I hope that we shall never sink so low that we shall have to ask for aid from Mirabeau."<ref>Beraud, Henri ''Twelve Portraits of the French Revolution'' (New York: Books for Libraries Press Inc,1968):21.</ref>, and La Marck left Paris. However, in April 1790 he was suddenly recalled by the [[Florimond Claude, Comte de Mercy-Argenteau|comte de Mercy-Argenteau]], the Austrian [[Ambassador (diplomacy)|ambassador]] to Paris and the queen's most trusted political adviser. From this time to Mirabeau's death he became the bearer of almost daily communications between Mirabeau and the queen. Mirabeau at first attempted to make an alliance with Lafayette, but it was useless, for Lafayette was not a strong man himself.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} From May 1790 to his death in April 1791 Mirabeau remained in close connection with the court, and drew up many state papers for it. In return the court paid his debts and was given a monthly subsidy of six thousand francs; but it ought never to be said that he was bribed, for the court's gold never made him swerve from his political principles; never, for instance, was he a royalist. He regarded himself as a minister, though an unavowed one, and believed himself worthy of his hire. Mirabeau was not the traitor that many believed him to be, because he continued to uphold the ideas which were the foundation of his political structure and tried to make possible a bridge between the ideas and wants King and the Revolutionaries.<ref>Beraud, Henri ''Twelve Portraits of the Revolution'' (New York: Libraries for Press Inc, 1968):21.</ref>  

Mirabeau focused his efforts on two main issues: changing the ministry and dealing with impending civil war. His attempts to form political alliances with Lafayette and Necker failed and resulted in open hostility. Necker disappeared from the French court and no longer posed a threat. Lafayette, however, was very powerful due to the fact that he held a monopoly on the military and the national guard. At first, Mirabeau attempted to undermine Lafayette<U+2019>s power, but decided to solve the problem of the ministry, and maintain stability, by removing all ministers and placing the ministry entirely under Lafayette. In effect, Mirabeau suggested that the king distance himself from politics and let the revolution run its course, because it would inevitably destroy itself through its contradictory nature. Furthermore, Mirabeau proposed that, if his plan should fail, Paris should no longer be the capital of France, showing a conservative line of thinking: the only way to end the revolution would be to destroy its place of birth. Mirabeau<U+2019>s prospects with the crown were good until 1790, when the Chatelet presented to the National Assembly that the inciters of the October days were the duc d<U+2019>Orleans and Mirabeau himself. The charges were later removed, but for Mirabeau, the accusation had brought the realization that his strategy of working closely with both the Assembly and the court was beginning to backfire. In a later meeting with the king and queen, Mirabeau maintained that not only was civil war inevitable, it was necessary for the survival of the monarchy. Mirabeau maintained the belief that the decision to go to war, even civil war, should come only from the king. In a letter of confidence to Mirabeau, Louis wrote that as a Christian king, he could not declare war on his subjects. However, that wouldn<U+2019>t stop him from reciprocating if his subjects declared war first. In order to avoid provoking a civil war, the king refrained from confronting the Constituent Assembly, and waited instead for a constitution that he could submit to. Once the civil constitution of the clergy destroyed this hope, Louis adopted a strategy of strengthening royal authority and the church<U+2019>s position, and accepted the use of force, through civil war, to accomplish this. Mirabeau's involvement with the court is interesting for the insights it provides into the mind of Louis XVI as it is for the effects it produced in the Revolution<ref>{{cite journal

On the question of the veto he took a practical view, and seeing that the royal power was already sufficiently weakened, declared for the king's absolute veto and against the suspensive veto. He knew from his British experience that such a veto would be rarely used unless the king felt the people were on his side, and that if it were used unjustifiably the power of the purse possessed by the representatives of the people would bring about a [[Glorious Revolution|bloodless revolution]], as in England in 1688. He saw that much of the Assembly's inefficiency arose from the members' inexperience and their incurable verbosity; so, to establish some system of rules, he got his friend Romilly to draw up a detailed account of the rules and customs of the British House of Commons, which he translated into French, but which the Assembly, puffed up by a belief in its own merits, refused to use. On the subject of peace and war he supported the king's authority, with some success. Again Mirabeau almost alone of the Assembly held that the soldier ceased to be a citizen when he became a soldier; he must submit to the deprivation of his liberty to think and act, and must recognize that a soldier's first duty is obedience. With such sentiments, it is no wonder that he approved of the vigorous conduct of the [[Fran<U+00E7>ois Claude Amour, marquis de Bouill<U+00E9>|marquis de Bouill<U+00E9>]] at [[Nancy]], which was to his credit as Bouill<U+00E9> was opposed to him. Lastly, in matters of finance he showed his wisdom: he attacked Necker's "caisse d'escompte," which was to have the whole control of the taxes, as absorbing the Assembly's power of the purse; and he heartily approved of the system of [[assignat]]s, but with the reservation that the issue should be limited to no more than one-half the value of the lands to be sold.

In foreign affairs, he held that the French people should conduct their Revolution as they would, and that no foreign nation had any right to interfere with the country's internal affairs. But he knew that neighbouring nations were disturbed by the progress of the Revolution and feared its influence on their own peoples; and that foreign monarchs were being importuned by French emigres to interfere on behalf of the French monarchy. To prevent this interference, or rather to give no pretext for it, was his guiding principle in foreign policy. He was elected a member of the ''comit<U+00E9> diplomatique'' of the Assembly in July 1790, and in this capacity he was able to prevent the Assembly from doing much harm in regard to foreign affairs. He had long known [[Armand Marc, comte de Montmorin]], the foreign secretary, and, as matters became more strained, he entered into daily communication with the minister, advising him on every point, and, while dictating his policy, defended it in the Assembly. Mirabeau's exertions in this respect show him as a statesman; and his influence is best shown by the confusion in this department after his death.

==Death==

[[Image:Plaque Mirabeau.jpg|thumb|right|House where Mirabeau died in Paris.]]

Mirabeau's health had been damaged by the excesses of his youth and his strenuous work in politics, and in 1791, he contracted [[pericarditis]]. However, some attributed his illness to a poisoning. By this time, it is evident that the King had lost all confidence in his former adviser, and Mirabeau<U+2019>s plans never took effect. Although he had been only recently elected  president for two weeks of the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]], despite the continuous medical attention paid to him by his friend and physician, [[Pierre Jean George Cabanis|Cabanis]], Mirabeau would survive to perform his duties until his death on 2 April 1791, in Paris.  It was here that he directed debates with eloquence further increasing his popularity.  The people of Paris cherished him as one of the fathers of the Revolution.<ref>Hampson, Norman. ''Prelude to Terror''. (New York: Basil Blackwell, 1988)42.</ref> As he lay on his death bed, weak and unable to speak, Mirabeau's last action before passing was to write one word: "dormir" (to sleep).{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}  During the king<U+2019>s trial, Mirabeau<U+2019>s dealings with the royal court were brought to light, and he was largely discredited by the public after it became known that he had secretly acted as an intermediary between the monarchy and the revolution and had taken payment for it.<ref>{{cite book

He received a grand burial, and it was for him that [[The Panth<U+00E9>on]] in Paris was created as a burial place for great Frenchmen. The street where he died ([[rue de la Chauss<U+00E9>e d'Antin]]) was renamed ''rue Mirabeau''. In 1792 his secret dealings with the king were uncovered: his remains were removed from the Pantheon in 1794 and were replaced with those of Marat.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Oxford History of the French Revolution |last=Doyle |first=William |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2002 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford, UK |isbn=9780199252985 |page=283 |url= |accessdate=}}</ref> His remains were then buried anonymously in Clamart's graveyard. In spite of searches performed in 1889, they were not found.

At the time of his death, Mirabeau greatly feared for the future of any constitutional Monarchy in France, as he recognized that many powerful and radically inclined interests would not give such arrangements their support. Mirabeau tried to remove the tyrannical power of the King, but additionally tried to substitute a strong and respectable governing power.  The tragedy of his life was that he was unable to put into practice freely his moderate policy and ideas without any conflicts from the other provisional powers.  He provided the Assembly with a guiding and powerful direction, and when he died there was no one to pick up on his legacy.

==Collaborators==
His first literary work, except the bombastic but eloquent ''Essai sur le despotisme'' (Neufch<U+00E2>tel, 1775), was a translation of Robert Watson's ''Philip II'', done in Holland with the help of Durival; his ''Considerations sur l'ordre de Cincinnatus'' (London, 1788) was based on a pamphlet by [[Aedanus Burke]] (1743-1802), of [[South Carolina]], who opposed the aristocratic tendencies of the Society of the Cincinnati, and the notes to it were by Target; his financial writings were suggested by the Genevese exile, [[<U+00C9>tienne Clavi<U+00E8>re|Clavi<U+00E8>re]].

During the Revolution he received yet more help; men were proud to labour for him, and did not murmur because he absorbed all the credit and fame. <U+00C9>tienne Dumont, Clavi<U+00E8>re, Antoine Adrien Lamourette and <U+00C9>tienne Salonion Reybaz were but a few of the most distinguished of his collaborators. Dumont was a Genevese exile, and an old friend of Romilly's, who willingly prepared for him those famous addresses which Mirabeau used to make the Assembly, pass by sudden bursts of eloquent declamation; Clavi<U+00E8>re helped him in finance and not only worked out his figures but also even wrote his financial discourses; Lamourette wrote the speeches, on the [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy]]; Reybaz not only wrote for him his famous speeches on the assignats, the organization of the national guard, and others, which Mirabeau read word for word at the tribune, but also even the posthumous speech on succession to the estates of intestates, which Talleyrand read in the Assembly as the last work of his dead friend.
