{{foreignchar|Guenther Specht|<U+00FC>}}
'''G<U+00FC>nther Specht''' (13 November 1914&nbsp;<U+2013> 1 January 1945) was a [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[Luftwaffe]] [[fighter ace]] during [[World War II]].

Specht joined the [[Bomber destroyer]] [[Wing (military aviation unit)|Wing]] ({{lang-de|[[Zerst<U+00F6>rergeschwader 26]]}}) (ZG 26) "Horst Wessel" in early 1939. The unit was initially equipped with [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]]s and later with the [[Bf 110]]. In 1939 he was wounded by an RAF tail gunner and blinded in one eye. He returned to active duty and was shot down six times during the war. After his recovery in 1939, he chose to return to active service but was shot down again in France and was seriously injured. These injuries kept him grounded for the next two years. In 1942 he returned to active duty with Fighter Wing 1 (''[[Jagdgeschwader 1 Oesau]] (JG 1)''). He was then made Group Commander (''[[Gruppenkommandeur]]'') of II Group of [[JG 11]] (II./JG 11) and promoted to ''[[Major (Germany)|Major]]''. He was appointed as [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]] (''[[Geschwaderkommodore]]'') of JG 11 and was listed as [[missing in action]] during the attack on the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] bases at [[Asch Airfield|Asch]] and [[Ophoven Airfield|Ophoven]] as part of [[Operation Bodenplatte]]. He was posthumously promoted to [[lieutenant colonel]] ({{lang-de|[[Oberstleutnant]]}}) and was recommended for the Oak Leaves ({{lang-de|Eichenlaub}}) to the Knight's Cross, which was refused for unknown reasons. 

Specht was considered as one of the best fighter leaders during the war and was a recipient of the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]] ({{lang-de|Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes}}). During his combat career he was credited with 34 enemy aircraft destroyed, all downed on the [[Western Front (World War II)|Western Front]].

==Personality==
Specht was born on 13 November 1914 in Frankenstein (modern [[Z<U+0105>bkowice <U+015A>l<U+0105>skie]]) of [[Prussia]] (modern [[Poland]]). Specht was small in stature but full of energy. He had a distinguishing patch of gray in his hair just above his forehead. He was a perfectionist with a high sense of duty, and expected his men to follow his high standards. Although he lost his left eye in late 1939, according to [[Squadron Leader]] ({{lang-de|Staffelkapit<U+00E4>n}}) [[Heinz Knoke]] of 5./JG 11, he could see like a vulture and was an excellent marksman. Specht also had an eye for detail, and he wrote detailed [[Debriefing#Military debriefing|mission log]] reports for future use.<ref name = Caldwell.07.91/><ref name = Zorner.07.125/><ref name=Obermaier.86>Obermaier (1986)</ref><ref name = Wealb.99.54>Weal (1999b), p. 54</ref>

Specht's personal emblems adorning his aircraft included a design by Specht of a pencil superimposed on a [[Chevron (insignia)|chevron]] (termed a winged pencil) as a wry comment on being deskbound following his injuries. It may also have symbolized his possible desire to pilot the [[Dornier Do 17]], nicknamed the "Flying Pencil". His single-engine aircraft with JG 11 sported a green spinner and a Knight's Cross painted on the cowling after he was awarded the honour in April 1944.<ref name = weal.99.36>Weal (1999a), pp. 36,49</ref><ref name = Wealb.99.93>Weal (1999b), p. 93</ref><ref name = JohnWeal.06.70/>

Specht would not allow women on the group base, considering them an unnecessary diversion. According to Knoke, one time Specht's wife came to visit him on the II./JG 11 base but was held at the guard room on Specht's orders and refused to receive calls from the guard. Instead he asked Knoke to pass a message to her to 'put herself on ice', saying that he would only have time for her after the war. Specht however did not survive, dying five months before the [[Victory in Europe Day|war in Europe came to an end]].<ref name = Caldwell.07.91/><ref name = Zorner.07.125/>

===Formation leadership===
After taking command of II./JG 11, Specht led the group on every mission in which it participated. Following each mission, he wrote detailed and analytical mission reports. He soon gained a reputation as one of the most reliable formation leaders, with II./JG 11 reputed to be one of the best units among the fighter force ({{lang-de|jagdwaffe}}) on Reich air defense ({{lang-de|Reichsluftverteidigung}}).<ref name = Caldwell.07.91/><ref name = JohnWeal.06.26/>

On 17 August 1943 Specht led the group from [[Gilze en Rijen]] on an intercept and sighted the  [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress|B-17 Flying Fortresses]] of [[381st Training Group|381 Bombing Group]] near [[Antwerp]]. He waited for 30 minutes until the [[Escort fighter|escorts]] turned back at [[Eupen]] before attacking. Within the next half hour, sixty percent of the bombers went down. Specht himself was credited with downing two as his 16th and 17th victories.<ref name = Wealb.99.36>Weal (1999b), p. 36</ref>

On 11 September 1944 Specht and the JG 11 staff flight ({{lang-de|Stabsschwarm}}) led a combined formation of II./[[JG 4]] (Sturm) ({{lang-de|Sturmgruppen}}) and III./JG 4. Due to Specht's skills, they positioned themselves against thirty-four B-17s of the [[100th Air Refueling Wing|"Bloody 100th"]] and fifteen B-17s were downed before the escorting P-51s arrived. Specht was credited with one P-51.<ref name=Caldwell.07.233>Caldwell & Mulller (2007), p. 233</ref><ref name = Aces/>

==Military career==

===Heavy fighters===
At the beginning of the [[Phoney War]] in late August 1939, Specht was an [[Oberleutnant]] serving with 3rd ''Staffel'', [[Zerst<U+00F6>rergeschwader 26]]. On 29 September 1939 11 [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) [[Handley Page Hampden]] [[medium bomber]]s of [[No. 144 Squadron RAF]] conducted an armed reconnaissance operation near [[Heligoland]] in the [[German Bight]]. One six-strong aircraft formation attacked two [[destroyer]]s unsuccessfully, while five bombers led by [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]] J. C. Cunningham were intercepted by Specht's unit. All five were shot down and Specht claimed his first two victories.<ref name=Obermaier.86/><ref name = weal.99.37>Weal (1999a), p. 37</ref><ref name = Caldwell.07.3678>Caldwell & Muller (2007), p. 36, 78</ref><ref name = weal.96.21>Weal (1996a), pp. 20<U+2013>21</ref>

On 3 December 1939, 24 RAF [[Vickers Wellington]] bombers from [[RAF Marham|Marham]] and [[RAF Mildenhall|Mildenhall]] bases attacked Heligoland. These were intercepted by I./ZG 26 along with other Messerschmitt Bf 109 units. Specht attacked one bomber over the [[North Sea]], and his aircraft was hit by return fire from the Wellington's [[tail gunner]], seriously wounding him in the face and forcing him to [[Ditching|ditch]] the aircraft. He subsequently lost the sight in his left eye. Specht resumed combat flying despite the handicap. He would eventually be shot down six times during the war.<ref name = weal.99.101>Weal (1999b), p. 101</ref> He was shot down by [[Corporal]] Copley of [[No. 38 Squadron RAF]].<ref>Holmes 2010, p. 32.</ref> 

On 23 May 1940 Spitfires were encountered by Bf 110s and Bf 109s for the first time. The engagement resulted in the loss of two Bf 110s and two Bf 109s. However, Specht would claim three RAF [[Supermarine Spitfire]] fighters shot down. The British [[No. 92 Squadron RAF]] involved lost three Spitfires in the entire engagement. [[Squadron Leader]] [[Roger Bushell|Roger J Bushell]] became a [[prisoner of war]] while Paul H. Klipsch and Patrick Alexander George Learmond were [[killed in action]].<ref name="epibreren">Droog, Bart. 
[http://www.epibreren.com/ww2/raf/92_squadron.html "RAF - No. 92 Squadron."] ''Traces of World War 2'' 23 January 2008. Retrieved: 20 September 2010.</ref><ref name = weal.99.37>Weal (1999a), p. 37</ref> During the course of this battle, Specht and his rear gunner/radio operator were wounded, [[forced landing|force land]] near [[Calais]] and [[Boulogne-sur-Mer]] with a damaged aircraft. Specht's wounds were serious enough to keep him from combat duty for almost two years.<ref name=Obermaier.86/><ref name = weal.99.37>Weal (1999a), p. 37</ref><ref name="Caldwell.07.3678"/>

Upon recovery Specht served as Group staff officer ({{lang-de|[[Adjutant|Gruppenadjutant]]}}) of I./ZG 26. His aircraft at the time had group identifier ({{lang-de|Gruppenkennung}}) U8+BB. It carried the group staff flight ({{lang-de|Gruppenstab}}) emblem of a winged pencil which had been designed by Specht.<ref name = weal.99.36>Weal (1999a), pp. 36, 49</ref><ref name = Wealb.99.93>Weal (1999b), p. 93</ref>

Specht was appointed as ''Gruppenkommandeur'' of the [[night fighter]] training group ({{lang-de|Erg<U+00E4>nzungsgruppe}}) of [[Nachtjagdgeschwader 1]] on 31 October 1941. Located at [[Ingolstadt Manching Airport|Ingolstadt-Manching]], Specht instructed pilots in conversion to night fighting. [[Paul Zorner]], a future night fighter expert, was one of his students. This was the last time Specht flew a twin engine aircraft.<ref name = Zorner.07.125>Zorner (2007), pp. 125<U+2013>139</ref>

===Single-engine fighters===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-398-1794-18, Flugzeug Messerschmitt Me 109 G-2.jpg|thumb|alt=single engine aircraft parked in a field|A Bf 109 ''Gustav'' similar to one used by Specht]]
A year later, with the training group converted into a night fighter school (III./[[Nachtjagdschule 1]]), Specht returned to active combat with a transfer to 10 ''Staffel'', [[Jagdgeschwader 1 (World War II)|Jagdgeschwader 1]] (10./JG 1), operating from [[M<U+00F6>nchengladbach]] (moved to [[Deelen Air Base|Deelen]] in February 1943) and equipped with the [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190]]. On 26 February 1943, he shot down his first [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]] [[B-17 Flying Fortress]].<ref name=Obermaier.86/><ref name="Michaelholm97">Holm (1997<U+2013>2003)</ref>

On 14 May, Captain ({{lang-de|[[Hauptmann]]}}) Specht moved to [[Jagdgeschwader 11]] and became ''Gruppenkommandeur'' of II./JG 11, equipped with the Bf 109G ''Gustav''.<ref name = Caldwell.07.91>Caldwell & Muller (2007), p. 91</ref><ref name = JohnWeal.06.26>Weal (2006), p. 26</ref><ref name = Aces>Aces of the Luftwaffe.</ref> JG 11 was a newly formed [[day fighter]] unit operating across the [[North German Plain|north German plains]].

After joining JG 11, Specht continued to claim ''Viermot'' (German slang for heavy bombers). His fifth victory with JG 11 was on 25 June 1943 giving him a total of 12. He claimed one a month later during [[Blitz Week]], when bombers targeted the [[Blohm + Voss|Blohm & Voss]] [[Submarine pen|U Boat yards]] in [[Hamburg]] and the [[synthetic rubber]] factories of [[Continental AG]] and [[Nordhafen]] in [[Hanover]].<ref name = Aces/><ref name = Wealb.99.30>Weal (1999b), p. 30</ref>

On 4 October 1943, Specht led II./JG 11 with III./JG 11 and ''Jasta Heligoland'' to down four [[B-24 Liberator]] bombers out of twenty three, one being credited to Specht. Specht became increasingly critical of the relatively weak [[armament]] of the Bf 109 during this time. By the end of 1943 Specht had a total of 24 victories, including 14 heavy bombers, one of the leading ''Viermot'' (heavy bombers) experts. He was also II./JG 11's leading scorer, having claimed 17 victories in 1943.<ref name=Obermaier.86/><ref name = Wealb.99.51>Weal (1999b), p. 51</ref><ref name = Caldwell.07.124>Caldwell & Muller (2007), p. 124,184</ref>

On 11 February 1944 II./JG 11 engaged escort fighters returning from a raid on [[Frankfurt]] with Specht downing [[2nd Lieutenant]] Richard McDonald of the [[354th Fighter Group]], who crashed his [[P-51 Mustang]] "Plane Jane" near [[Oberalben]].<ref>Reardon (14 July 1997), The Patriot Ledger</ref> Nine days later, Specht had to [[Emergency landing|crash land]] on the [[<U+00C6>r<U+00F8>]] Island as a result of technical problems with his Bf 109G. On 15 March II./JG 11 lost six killed in action, two wounded, and eight aircraft lost, resulting in Specht declaring the unit non-operational for six weeks to rest and replace losses.<ref name=Obermaier.86/><ref name = Wealb.99.51>Weal (1999b), p. 51</ref><ref name="Caldwell.07.124"/>

On 8 April 1944 Specht was awarded the ''Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes'' for 31 victories on the [[Western Front (World War II)|Western Front]]. While II./JG 11 was still rebuilding at [[Eschborn]], Specht was moved to wing command flight ({{lang-de|Geschwaderstab}}) as kommodore-in-training, and was replaced by ''Major'' [[G<U+00FC>nther Rall]] from [[JG 52]]. On 15 May 1944 Specht was appointed ''Geschwaderkommodore'' ([[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]]) of JG 11 after [[Hermann Graf]] was wounded. In July, Specht had to crash land again and suffered head injuries. Despite severe pain from his injuries Specht remained on combat duty.

During [[Operation Market Garden]], the [[Allied]] [[parachute]] landings in the [[Netherlands]], JG 11 was credited with 22 aircraft downed on 22 September, with two credited to Specht. Four days later, Specht claimed two RAF [[Hawker Typhoon]]s near [[Deventer]].<ref name=Obermaier.86/><ref name = JohnWeal.06.70>Weal (2006), pp. 70<U+2013>71</ref><ref name = Caldwell.07.184>Caldwell & Muller (2007), p. 184</ref><ref name = weal.99.71>Weal (1999b), p. 71</ref><ref name = WW2Awards>Gunther Specht on World War 2 Awards</ref> According to RAF records only three Typhoons were shot down on 26 September; two to ''flak'' and one in aerial combat against ''[[Jagdgeschwader 53]]'' Bf 109s near [[Apeldoorn]]. No fighters were recorded lost near Deventer.<ref>Franks 2000, p. 101.</ref> However, it may be the case that loss records were lost or not well kept, meaning Specht's claims cannot be traced and may well be accurate.<ref>Franks 2000. p. 7.</ref>

===Operation Bodenplatte===
{{Main|Operation Bodenplatte}}
[[File:Fw 190 A-8.jpg|thumb|right|250px|An Fw 190 A-8/R2 in American hands. This Fw 190 was captured during ''Bodenplatte''. Specht flew an Fw 190A on this date.]]
On New Year<U+2019>s Day 1945 the ''Luftwaffe'' launched Operation Baseplate, a low-level fighter attack targeted at Allied airfields throughout France, Belgium and the Netherlands in support of the [[German Army]] in [[Battle of the Bulge]]. JG 11 was assigned the USAAF airfield at [[Asch Airfield|Asch]] (Code Name Y<U+2013>29) and the RAF airfield at [[Ophoven Airfield|Ophoven]] north of Asch. The [[366th Fighter Group]] (366th FG, [[Ninth Air Force]]) and the [[352d Fighter Group|352nd Fighter Group]] (352 FG, [[Eighth Air Force]]) were based at Asch. [[No. 41 Squadron RAF|No. 41]], [[No. 130 Squadron RAF|No. 130]], [[350th Squadron (Belgium)|350]] and [[No. 610 Squadron RAF|No. 610]] [[Squadron (aviation)|Squadron]]s of the [[2nd Tactical Wing]] were based at Ophoven.<ref name=Obermaier.86/><ref name = WW2Awards/><ref name = Parker.98.385>Parker (1998), pp. 383, 385<U+2013>391</ref>

For this mission Specht wore his full dress uniform with medals instead of his flight suit. JG 11 was based at [[Griesheim|Darmstadt-Griesheim]], [[Mainhausen|Zellhausen]], and [[Grossostheim|Gross-Ostheim]]. I./JG 11, III./JG 11 (Fw 190 A<U+2013>9), and II./JG 11 (Bf 109G) mustered sixty-five aircraft for this mission. Specht flew Fw 190 A-9 (Wk. Nr. 205033) "Black 4". At 8:08 am{{ref label|Note3|c|c}} the aircraft took off and assembled over [[Aschaffenburg]] with two [[Junkers Ju 188]] 'Pathfinders' to navigate. After assembling, Specht ordered all aircraft to fly at {{convert|400|ft}} to the target area, climbing to {{convert|1500|ft}} prior to commencing the attack. Some [[P-47 Thunderbolt]]s of the [[390th Fighter Squadron]], 366th FG, were already airborne and Mustangs of the [[487th Fighter Squadron]], 352nd FG, were on the runway. The formation was disrupted by [[Anti-aircraft warfare|flak]], and several German aircraft were shot down.{{ref label|Note1|a|a}}<ref name = Zorner.07.125/><ref name = Parker.98.385/>

The P-47 and P-51s took a heavy toll of JG 11; some 25 pilots were lost, including Specht, who was posted missing, along with other senior officers of JG 11.<ref name = Caldwell.07.78>Caldwell & Muller, (2007) p. 78</ref><ref name=Obermaier.86/><ref name = WW2Awards/><ref name = Wealb.99.84>Weal (1999b), p. 84</ref>

===Death and confusion===
There was some confusion over the circumstance of Specht's death. Lt. Melvin Paisley and his [[wingman]] Flight Officer Dave Johnson were flying 366th FG P-47s; Johnson shot down two German fighters before his aircraft was heavily damaged from return fire. Bailing out, he landed in a field near Asch. A Bf 109 he had shot down had [[Belly landing|belly landed]] close by and Johnson rode a borrowed bicycle over to inspect it. The aircraft was intact but the pilot was dead. Johnson took the pilot's identification card and gun and rode back to base. The identification card identified the pilot as a ''Oberstleutnant'' ({{lang-de|[[Oberstleutnant]]}}); however, the card actually belonged to ''Oberleutnant'' August Engel of ''8 Staffel''.<ref name=Parker98pp385387/>

Further research has revealed more detail. German records confirmed Specht flew a Fw 190, not a Bf 109, and that he was a ''Major'' at the time, confirming Johnson's victim was most likely to have been Engel. Johnson's claim form revealed he had claimed a Bf 109, not an Fw 190. The ID card of Johnson's victim was passed on to a member of the ground crew who spoke German. This individual stated that the rank was given as Lieutenant Colonel. The incorrect identification was most likely a language error and misunderstanding of German ranks. This may have caused the belief that Johnson had killed Specht. Johnson passed away in October 1976, and aviation historians were unable to secure his version of events.<ref>Manrho & P<U+00FC>tz 2004, pp. 148<U+2014>149.</ref> 

Specht was officially listed as missing in action over [[Maastricht]], and to date he remains missing. The cause of his demise is unknown.<ref>Manhro and P<U+00FC>tz 2004, p. 279.</ref> Specht was promoted posthumously to ''Oberstleutnant''  and nominated for the ''Eichenlaub'' to his Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross. The Oak Leaves were not awarded. Specht shot down 34 aircraft including 17 heavy bombers. All his victories were recorded over the Western Front and included 15 four-engine bombers.<ref name=Caldwell.07.78/><ref name=Obermaier.86/><ref name = WW2Awards/><ref name=Parker98pp385387>Parker (1998), pp. 385<U+2013>391.</ref><ref name=Johnmanrho04>Manrho & P<U+00FC>tz (2004), p. 149.</ref><ref name = JohnWeal.06.84>Weal (2006), p. 84</ref>{{ref label|Note1|b|b}}
