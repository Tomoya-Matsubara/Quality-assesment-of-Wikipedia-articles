The '''Levavasseur project''' was an early project for a [[tank]] designed in 1903 by the French Captain Levavasseur of the 6th Artillery Battalion,<ref>''Armoured fighting vehicles of the world'' Duncan Crow 1970, p.65</ref> described as a "automobile cannon project" (French: ''Projet de canon autopropulseur''). It is considered as the first description, made by a soldier, of what was going to become the tank.<ref>Gougaud, p.99</ref> Levavasseur was a graduate of [[Ecole Polytechnique]], of the promotion of 1881 or 1882.<ref>Gougaud, p.100</ref> According to ''Armoured Fighting Vehicles of the World'':

{{quote|"A project for a vehicle which had all the characteristics later thought desirable in a tank was put forward to the French War Ministry as early as 1903. Devised by a Captain Levavasseur of the 6th Artillery Battalion, who called it a "canon autopropulseur", the vehicle was envisaged as carrying a 75mm gun mounted in a box-like steel caisson which ran on crawler tracks, or "roues articul<U+00E9>es" as Levavasseur called them. Powered by a 80 h.p. petrol engine, the Levavasseur machine would have had a crew of three, stowage for ammunition, and a cross-country ability."|''Armoured Fighting Vehicles of the World'', by Chris Ellis and Peter Chamberlain.<ref>''Armoured Fighting Vehicles of the World'', by Chris Ellis and Peter Chamberlain p.65</ref>}}

==Submission==
The project was submitted to the French Technical Artillery Committee (''Comit<U+00E9> G<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>ral d'Artillerie''), and after two years of study was presented to the Army Minister by the General President of the Committee. The general described the project in letter No135, dated 1 February 1905:

{{quote|"The objective of the machine is to create an automobile artillery piece, capable of going over the rough terrain only accessible to horse carriages, and offering to the personnel and the engine parts a complete protection from indirect or small arms fire".|General President of the Technical Artillery Committee to the Army Minister, 1 February 1905.<ref>Original French: "On se propose d'<U+00E9>tablir une pi<U+00E8>ce de campagne automobile susceptible de parcourir tous les terrains accessibles aux voitures attel<U+00E9>es et qui assure au personnel et aux organes de mouvement une protection compl<U+00E8>te contre le tir fusant et la balle d'Infanterie", in Gougaud, p.99</ref>}}

==Construction==
The locomotive mechanism is then described as a type of [[continuous track]], supporting an armoured box with a weapon:<ref>Gougaud, p.99</ref>

{{quote|
"The all-terrain mobility necessary to this machine is achieved by a contraption equivalent to a wheel of very large diameter. This contraption, called an "articulated wheel", consist in a sort of [[rim]] composed of links ("voussoirs") connected together by bolts around which they can rotate, and with an elastic connection tending to close up the space between the voussoirs. The faces of the links adjacent to the ground serve as the "sole" of the wheel, and the links opposite form a [[Race (bearing)|race]] ("Chemin de roulement"). These two faces are [[cylindrical]] and concentric. Those forming the sole have a [[radius]] of four meters. These faces form two continuous surfaces when the links are connected.

A box is positioned with [[rollers]] on the [[Race (bearing)|races]] of the two identical articulated wheels. The rollers are positioned so as to maintain the natural shape of the articulated wheels.

Besides these rollers, the box supports two [[sprocket]]s on each side, the teeths of which mesh with the bolts of the links. They are rotated by an 80hp engine.

The box, made of bulletproof steel, hold [[Canon de 75|an artillery piece of 75mm]] on a special gun carriage. It transports one commander, three servants and ammunitions."|General President of the Technical Artillery Committee to the Army Minister, 1 February 1905.<ref>Original French: "La mobilit<U+00E9> n<U+00E9>cessaire <U+00E0> ce projet est obtenue, dans le projet dont il s'agit, par l'emploi d'un dispositif <U+00E9>quivalent <U+00E0> des roues de tr<U+00E8>s grand diam<U+00E8>tre.<br>
Ce dispositif, appel<U+00E9> "roues articul<U+00E9>es", consiste en une sorte de jante compos<U+00E9>e de voussoirs r<U+00E9>unis entre eux par des boulons autour desquels ils peuvent tourner et munis d'une liaison <U+00E9>lastique tendant <U+00E0> appliquer l'une contre l'autre les faces voisines de deux voussoirs. Les faces des voussoirs qui reposent sur le sol forment la semelle de la roue, et les faces oppos<U+00E9>es un chemin de roulement. Ces deux faces sont cylindriques et concentriques. Celles qui forment la semelle ont un rayon de quatre m<U+00E8>tres. Elles constituent deux surfaces continues quand les voussoirs sont jointifs.<br>
Une caisse repose par l'interm<U+00E9>diaire de galets sur les chemins de roulement de deux roues articul<U+00E9>es identiques. Les galets sont dispos<U+00E9>s pour laisser aux roues leur forme naturelle.<br>
En dehors de ces galets de roulement, la caisse porte de chaque cot<U+00E9> deux galets d'entrainement dont les dents engr<U+00E8>nent avec les boulons des voussoirs. Ils sont activ<U+00E9>s par un moteur <U+00E0> p<U+00E9>trole de 80cv.<br>
La caisse en t<U+00F4>le d'acier <U+00E0> l'<U+00E9>preuve des balles, porte une pi<U+00E8>ce de 75 sur aff<U+00FB>t sp<U+00E9>cial. Elle transporte un chef de piece, trois servants et des munitions" quoted in Gougaud, p.99</ref>}}

==Reception==
The Artillery Technical Committee raised three major objections:<ref>Gougaud, p.99-100</ref><br>
1) All-terrain machines had not to that day given satisfaction.<br>
2) Hard bodies could infiltrate in the mechanism and damage it.<br>
3) Direction could not be properly controlled.

Overall, the need for such a machine was not felt, and horsedrawn artillery was considered as adequate.<ref>Gougaud, p.100</ref>

==Aftermath==
[[File:St. Chamond.jpg|thumb|left|The 1916 [[St Chamond (tank)|Saint Chamond]] tank was strikingly similar to the Levavasseur project in disposition, armament ([[Canon de 75]]), motorization (80hp engine) and general silhouette.<ref>Gougaud, p.128</ref>]]
Captain Levavasseur reworked his mechanism, improved its resistance to hard bodies and brought forward a new improved project in 1908 involving an expense of 14,000 [[francs]] for the realization of a mock-up.<ref>Gougaud, p.100</ref>

Finally the project was completely rejected by a 13 August 1908 letter explaining that a continuous tracks tractor was now available in England, the [[Hornsby]] of engineer Roberts.<ref>Gougaud, p.100</ref>

It is unclear whether [[General Estienne]], the French "Father of the tank" ever knew about this project. One officer however, Commandant Ferrus, who wrote the rejection report, participated in the Schneider tank experiments on 10 September 1915,<ref>Gougaud, p.111</ref> and became involved with the development of the [[St Chamond (tank)|Saint Chamond]] tank in 1916, which displays striking similarities with the Levavasseur project,<ref>Gougaud, p.215</ref> such as several characteristics of disposition, armament ([[Canon de 75]]), motorization (80&nbsp;hp engine) and general silhouette.<ref>Gougaud, p.128</ref>

Levavasseur became a Lieutenant Colonel of Artillery, and retired simply expressing his regret that his views had not been taken into consideration earlier before the advent of the [[World War I]] conflict.<ref>Gougaud, p.100</ref>
