'''Grotto Geyser''' is a fountain type geyser located in the Upper Geyser Basin in [[Yellowstone National Park]], [[Wyoming]], in the [[United States]]. Grotto Geyser is the namesake for the group of geysers that includes Grotto Fountain Geyser, South Grotto Fountain Geyser, Indicator Spring, Spa Geyser, and Rocket Geyser.<ref>{{cite web| title=Giant, Daisy and Grotto Groups| publisher=| url=http://www.geocities.com/dmonteit/gg_dg_gg.htm| accessmonthday=January 7|accessyear=2009}}</ref> Grotto Geyser's oddly shaped cone, which is almost {{convert|8|ft|m}} high, comes from sinter covering dead tree stumps that accumulated as the geyser erupted. The 1870 Washburn expedition named it after this.<ref>{{cite web| title=Old Faithful Geyser| publisher=| url=http://www.yellowstonenationalpark.com/uppergeyser.htm| accessmonthday=January 7| accessyear=2009}}</ref>

==Eruptions==
Grotto Geyser erupts about every eight hours. The interval between eruptions is longer after a longer eruption. The eruptions are about {{convert|10|ft|m}} high and can last from about 1 1/2 to more than 10 hours long, although there have been eruptions that lasted more than 26 hours. Its eruptions are usually preceded by an eruption from Grotto Fountain Geyser.<ref>{{cite web| title=Grotto Geyser Stop on the Old Faithful Area Tour| work=Old Faithful Area Tour | publisher=National Park Service| url=http://www.nps.gov/archive/yell/tours/oldfaithful/grottog.htm| accessmonthday=January 7|accessyear=2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=Quick Reference Guide to Upper Geyser Basin Selected

Approximately three-quarters of Grotto's eruptions are short mode. Grotto Geyser and Rocket Geyser erupt together. When Grotto Geyser has a long mode eruption, which lasts from 6-12 hours, Spa Geyser, instead of Rocket Geyser, erupts.<ref>{{cite web| title=GROTTO| publisher=| url=http://www.geyserstudy.org/geyser.aspx?pGeyserNo=GROTTO| accessmonthday=January 7|accessyear=2009}}</ref>
