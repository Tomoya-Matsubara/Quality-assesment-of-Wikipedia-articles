'''Christopher John Nitkowski''' (born [[March 9]], [[1973]], [[Suffern, New York]] ) is a [[left handed]] [[baseball]] [[pitcher]], as of [[2007]] with the [[Fukuoka Softbank Hawks]], in the [[Japanese Baseball|Japanese]] [[Pacific League]]. 

Nitkowski attended Don Bosco Preparatory High School in Ramsey, New Jersey, graduating in 1991. Not drafted out of high school, he attended Florida A&M University for one year before transferring to St. John's University. The [[Cincinnati Reds]] made him the ninth overall pick in the June 1994 draft.

He made his [[Major League Baseball]] debut on [[June 3]], [[1995]] with the Reds, and spent his earlier years as a starter before being converted to the bullpen. He has played for several other major league teams including the [[Detroit Tigers]], [[New York Mets]], [[Houston Astros]], [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]], [[Washington Nationals]] and the [[New York Yankees]].  However, after the 2006 season where Nitkowski bounced around between and AAA and MLB, Nitkowski accepted a 1-year contract tender with Nippon Professional Baseball's Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks.  Nitkowski has said he likes it in Japan, and would like to stay, given the opportunity.

Nitkowski was one of the first major leaguers to maintain his own Web site, where he posted ongoing personal diaries about life in the big leagues. In many ways, his contributions anticipated the phenomenon of blogging, several years before that term became known to the general public.

Raised a Catholic, Nitkowski converted to evangelical Christianity following an incident in which his daughter nearly drowned in the family pool.
