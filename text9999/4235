'''''World Premiere Toons''''' (later known as '''''What a Cartoon! Show''''', now known as '''''The Cartoon Cartoon Show'''''), was the mid-[[1990s]] [[animation]] showcase that appeared on the [[Cartoon Network]]. It served as the launching point for several original [[cartoon]]s including ''[[Dexter's Laboratory]]'', ''[[Johnny Bravo]]'', ''[[Cow and Chicken]]'', ''[[The Powerpuff Girls]]'', ''[[Courage the Cowardly Dog]]'', ''[[I Am Weasel]]'', ''[[Ed, Edd, and Eddy]]'', and ''[[Mike, Lu and Og]]''. The [[Big Cartoon DataBase]] cites ''What a Cartoon!''/''World Premiere Toons'' as a "venture combining classic [[1940s]] production methods with the originality, enthusiasm and comedy of the 1990s."

''World Premiere Toons'' was an animation project conceived and produced by [[Fred Seibert]], the original creative director of [[MTV]] and [[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon]] who served as the president of [[Cartoon Network Studios|Hanna-Barbera Cartoons, Inc.]], prior to founding [[Frederator Studios]].  Its mission was to return creative power to animators and artists, by recreating the atmospheres that spawned the great cartoon characters of the mid-[[20th century]].  Each of 48 short cartoons mirrored the structure of a theatrical cartoon, with each film being based on an original storyboard drawn and written by its artist/creator. 

Each of the show creators worked with the internal Hanna-Barbera "Creative Corps" Art Director [[Jesse Stagg]] and designer Kelly Wheeler to craft a series of high quality, limited edition, fluorescent art posters. The Corps launched a prolonged Guerilla mailing campaign, targeting animation heavyweights and critics leading up to the launch of 'World Premiere Toons.'' The first poster campaign of its kind introduced the world to the groundbreaking new stable of characters.

The first ''World Premiere Toon'' to be broadcast in its entirety was The Powerpuff Girls' ''Meat Fuzzy Lumpkins'', which made its world premiere on [[February 20]], [[1995]] during a television special called the ''World Premiere Toon-In'' (termed "President's Day Nightmare" by its producers, [[Williams Street]]). The special was hosted by [[Space Ghost]] and the cast of ''[[Space Ghost: Coast to Coast]]'', and featured comic interviews and a mock contest with the creators of the various cartoons. The ''Toon-In'' was simulcast on [[Cartoon Network]], [[TBS Superstation]], and [[Turner Network Television|TNT]]. The special, without the ''Powerpuff Girls'' cartoon or any of the clips from the other ''WPT'' cartoons featured in the special, was later included in the ''Space Ghost: Coast to Coast'' Volume 3 [[DVD]].

There were also a large number of [[animation|animated]] shorts created by several [[cartoonists]] such as: [[Genndy Tartakovsky]] (''Dexter's Laboratory'' (4 cartoon shorts) and Dial M for Monkey), [[David Feiss]] (''No Smoking'', which introduced the siblings [[Cow and Chicken]]), [[Van Partible]] (''[[Johnny Bravo]]'' (2 cartoon shorts) and Jungle Boy), [[Craig McCracken]] (''Meet Fuzzy Lumpkins,'' which introduced [[The Powerpuff Girls]], and ''Crime 101''), [[Butch Hartman]] (who did a number of one-shot shorts, including ''Pfish and Chip'' and ''Gramps''), [[Seth MacFarlane]] ([[Larry shorts|Larry and Steve]], which were prototypes of [[Peter Griffin]] and [[Brian Griffin|Brian]] of ''[[Family Guy]]''), [[John R. Dilworth]] (whose [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-nominated ''Chicken From Outer Space'' introduced [[Courage the Cowardly Dog]]), [[Zac Moncrief]] ("Godfrey and Zeek"), and countless others. Also included were works from veterans like [[William Hanna]] (''Wind-Up Wolf'' and ''Hard Luck Duck''), [[Joseph Barbera]] (shorts featuring [[The Flintstones]]' Dino), and [[Ralph Bakshi]] (''Malcolm and Melvin'').

The ''What a Cartoon!'' experiment introduced many of today's top animation talent and was repeated several times.  A similar program, also created by [[Fred Seibert]], was introduced on [[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon]] in 1998, titled ''[[Oh Yeah! Cartoons]]''.

==Trivia==
*Cartoon Network's ''What a Cartoon!'' project, which was assembled into a half-hour series, '''''The What a Cartoon! Show''''' (later re-named '''''The Cartoon Cartoon Show'''''), featured over 52 new seven-minute cartoons, starring 42 new characters.
*"[[Mina and the Count]]" shorts were also featured on the Seibert-produced ''[[Oh Yeah! Cartoons]]'' on [[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon]], making it the only cartoon to be featured on both shows.
