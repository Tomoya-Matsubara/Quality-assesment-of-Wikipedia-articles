"'''Little Girl in the Big Ten'''" is the twentieth episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]'' [[The Simpsons (season 13)|thirteenth season]].

In the episode, Lisa tries to fit in with two college students by lying about her age. Meanwhile, Bart is diagnosed with a weakened immune system after getting bitten by a Chinese mosquito and must live in a plastic, germ-free bubble.
 

__TOC__
==Plot==
Lisa finds herself unable to do any sports in PE class, taught by [[Springfield Elementary School#Brunella Pommelhorst|Brunella Pommelhorst]], and finds herself failing physical education ([[Lisa on Ice|again]]). She then signs up to do gymnastics with Coach Lugash (the angry, Russian gymnastics coach from "[[Children of a Lesser Clod]]"). There, she receives encouragement from the ghost of [[John F. Kennedy]] in a dream. That and her large head gives her perfect balance, Lisa passes with flying colors. Lisa also meets two girls and becomes friends with them, but with their fractals and parking permits, she realizes they are college students "with small gymnast bodies!" They give Lisa a ride home, and she acts like a college student to keep their friendship. The two girls invite her to a poetry reading by [[Robert Pinsky]] soon after. Lisa finds herself looking more like a college student with a beret, which helps her fit in even more.

Meanwhile, Bart gets bitten by a [[China|Chinese]] [[mosquito]] that was in his Krusty-saurus toy manufactured in a sweatshop with a communist Krusty logo, and becomes infected with "[[Hantavirus|Panda virus]]". To prevent getting others sick, [[Dr. Hibbert]] puts Bart in a plastic bubble. Bart has trouble adapting to life in the bubble even though Hibbert emphasized just how "normal" it would feel; he has trouble eating and Homer gives him a bath by filling up the bubble with the hose and rolling Bart around outside of the house.

Lisa is able to keep up her double life, attending a poetry reading by former [[Poet Laureate Consultant in Poetry|Poet Laureate]] [[Robert Pinsky]] (voiced by Pinsky himself) at night and attending her second grade class during the day. While going to Springfield University, she is tracked by Milhouse, Martin, and Database. At a lecture about [[Itchy & Scratchy]] cartoons, they blow Lisa's cover and she is no longer welcome by her college friends.

Lisa tries to convince Homer and [[Marge]] that college suits her, but they refuse to listen. Lisa also loses all of her friends her age, thinking they are not "college enough for her". Bart, in the meantime, gets used to his bubble, more popular, a thing of amusement for Homer as well. Bart tells Lisa what she should do to get her friends back: she has to pull a prank on Principal Skinner. The next day, Chalmers is dedicating the [[Seymour Skinner]] parking annex. While Martin takes pictures of Skinner posing next to a giant [[chocolate cake]] in his dress [[polyester]], Bart rolls Lisa (inside his bubble) to the edge of the school's roof. He then pushes her over the edge, splattering the cake all over Skinner. Lisa gets her friends back, while Bart goes paranoid after being outside for the first time in days. He stays in an air vent and gets sucked in.

==Production==
The episode was written by [[Jon Vitti]] and directed by [[Lauren MacMullan]]. The episode features the second appearance of Lugash who first appeared in "[[Children of a Lesser Clod]]".
