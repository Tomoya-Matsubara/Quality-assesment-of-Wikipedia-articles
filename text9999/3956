'''Arkansas City''' is a city in [[Cowley County, Kansas|Cowley County]], [[Kansas]], [[United States]], situated at the confluence of the [[Arkansas River|Arkansas]] and [[Walnut River|Walnut]] rivers in the southwestern part of the county.  As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the city population was 12,415.<ref name="Census2010">{{cite web|title=2010 City Population and Housing Occupancy Status|url=http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=DEC_10_PL_GCTPL2.ST13&prodType=table|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=March 6, 2011}}</ref>

The name of this city is not pronounced like the nearby state of [[Arkansas]], but rather as {{IPAc-en|<U+0251>r|<U+02C8>|k|<U+00E6>|n|z|<U+0259>|s}} (the final "s" is pronounced). Over the years there has been much confusion about the regional pronunciation of "Arkansas," which locals render as {{IPAc-en|<U+0251>r|<U+02C8>|k|<U+00E6>|n|z|<U+0259>|s}} rather than {{IPAc-en|<U+02C8>|<U+0251>r|k|<U+0259>n|s|<U+0254><U+02D0>}}.<!--for consistency we shouldn't have a secondary accent here, despite the dictionary.--><ref>[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/arkansas%20city?r=14 Pronunciation Guide]</ref>  Throughout much of Kansas, residents use this alternate pronunciation when referring to the [[Arkansas River]], as well as Arkansas Street in the city of [[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]].  Because of this, and for the sake of brevity, Arkansas City is most often referred to as simply '''Ark City'''.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}

== History ==
In 1601, New Mexico Governor [[Juan de O<U+00F1>ate]] led an expedition across the [[Great Plains]] and found a large settlement of Indians he called [[Rayado tribe|Rayados]].  The most likely location for the Rayado settlement was along the [[Walnut River]] in the eastern part of Arkansas City. Extensive remains of Indian settlements have been found along six miles of the Walnut River. The Rayados were the ancestors of the Indians later called [[Wichita people|Wichita]]. Wichita settlements from the 18th century are also found a few miles south of Arkansas City on the west bank of the Arkansas River.<ref>Vehik, Susan C. "Onate's Expedition to the Southern Plains: Routes, Destinations, and Implications for Late Prehistoric Cultural Adaptations." ''Plains Anthropologist'', Vol 31, No. 111, 1986, 13<U+2013>33</ref> (See [[Deer Creek/Bryson Paddock Sites]])

===19th century===

White settlers first congregated in the area where Arkansas City now stands in the 1860s. The natives referred to the place as "Nichonka," which roughly translates as "place between the waters" <U+2014> a reference to the confluence of the [[Arkansas river|Arkansas]] and Walnut rivers.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Settlers supposedly established a town in around 1870. They had difficulty choosing a name; at first they hoped to flatter [[United States Postmaster General|U.S. Postmaster General]] [[John A. J. Creswell]] (and win a highly-sought-after post office) by naming the town Creswell in his honor, but cities in other states had already used the name.  The town fathers considered other names, such as: Adelphia and Walnut City. Finally, the name '''Arkansas City''' was adopted for the town.<ref>{{cite book | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=5zdAAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA168#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=Biennial Report of the Board of Directors of the Kansas State Historical Society | publisher=Kansas State Printing Plant | author=Kansas State Historical Society | year=1916 | pages=168}}</ref> The first post office in Arkansas City was established on May 16, 1870.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131009131700/http://www.kshs.org/geog/geog_postoffices/search/county:CL | title=Kansas Post Offices, 1828-1961 (archived) | publisher=Kansas Historical Society | accessdate=6 June 2014}}</ref>

In 1877, the [[Florence, El Dorado, and Walnut Valley Railroad Company]] built a branch line from [[Florence, Kansas|Florence]] to [[El Dorado, Kansas|El Dorado]], in 1881 it was extended to [[Douglass, Kansas|Douglass]], and later to Arkansas City.<ref>''Marion County Kansas : Past and Present''; Sondra Van Meter; MB Publishing House; [[LCCN]] 72-92041; 344 pages; 1972.</ref>  The line was leased and operated by the [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway]].  The line from [[Florence, Kansas|Florence]] to [[El Dorado, Kansas|El Dorado]] was abandoned in 1942.<ref name="Abandon Railway 1942">[http://www.abandonedrails.com/Florence_to_El_Dorado Railway Abandonment 1942]</ref>  The original branch line connected [[Florence, Kansas|Florence]], [[Burns, Kansas|Burns]], [[De Graff, Kansas|De Graff]], [[El Dorado, Kansas|El Dorado]], [[Augusta, Kansas|Augusta]], [[Douglass, Kansas|Douglass]], [[Rock, Kansas|Rock]], [[Akron, Kansas|Akron]], [[Winfield, Kansas|Winfield]], Arkansas City.

Arkansas City grew steadily through the latter part of the 19th century, and enjoyed a population explosion starting in 1891, when thousands of people moved into the area in anticipation of the [[Cherokee Outlet|Cherokee Strip Land Run]]. It has been estimated that the city's population swelled from 5,000 to 150,000 (most living in temporary encampments) as the nationally-hyped federal land giveaway approached, and shrank back to 5,000 in its aftermath.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}

A small cave just east of town (in the Flint Hills) was a rest stop for [[Buffalo Bill Cody]] when he transited the area working the railroad and killing [[American bison|buffalo]].{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}

The [[James-Younger gang|James-Younger Gang]] of outlaws famously hid out in a cave west of town when they rode through the area.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}

===20th century===
At the turn of the century, Arkansas City was a rival to Wichita in size and enterprise, boasting several busy [[rail transportation|rail lines]], an elegant opera house, numerous fine hotels, a manufacturing base and a bustling agricultural economy. There was even a famous [http://abyss.kgs.ku.edu/pls/abyss/pubcat.phd1.SelectPhotosCounty?f_cnty=191 sanitarium] (health spa) at nearby [[Geuda Springs]], served by an electric railway running a triangular route from there to Ark City and Winfield. A popular swimming hole called Paris Lake was located west of downtown; the lake <U+2013> and the hot springs at Geuda as well <U+2013> was mired with silt in a flood about 1919. Nearly 20 years later the WPA would build the Paris Park pool in the same spot.  African Americans were not allowed to swim in the Paris Park pool during the era of [[Racial segregation|segregation]] and used a separate facility colloquially referred to as "the black pool" by local residents.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}

The Kirkwood Wind Engine Company, a former [[windmill]] manufacturer, was headquartered in Arkansas City near the turn of the 20th century;{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} the now-defunct [[Kanotex Refining Company]] established a [[oil refinery|refinery]] and headquarters in the city in 1917.<ref>{{cite web |first= Aspen |last= Junge |date= June 30, 2010 |url= http://www.kdheks.gov/remedial/articles/refining_history.pdf |format= PDF |title= Refining History |publisher= Kansas Department of Health and Environment |accessdate= May 5, 2012}}</ref>

In 1928, the city's official fall festival, Arkalalah, was inaugurated. This annual event still draws thousands of visitors each October, and features a queen, a carnival, dozens of homegrown fair food vendors and a spectacular parade typically lasting three hours or more. During the 1955 Arkalalah celebration, a retired [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway|Santa Fe]] locomotive was driven on temporary tracks down the city's main street, Summit, to the spot in Wilson Park where it remains today.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}

The city prospered through much of the 20th century, but by the 1980s, the community was facing economic challenges. The railroads shifted many of their crews to other stops, the old Rodeo meat packing plant, which for a short time was Morrell Meats, closed. In 1996 Total Petroleum closed their refinery in Ark City with a loss of 170 jobs. By 2003 other large employers in Cowley County closed operations. The [[Binney & Smith Inc.|Binney & Smith]] ([[Crayola]] plant) closed with a loss of 400 jobs. Winfield State Hospital and Gordon Piatt Industries were closed in nearby Winfield with a combined loss of 973 jobs. Montgomery KONE Elevator and Central Plains Book Manufacturing at nearby Strother Field were also shuttered.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}

===21st century===
Arkansas City is now home to state-of-the-art meat processor Creekstone Farms Premium Beef LLC which employs over 700 workers. Several smaller manufacturing companies are expanding their operations while new start ups are finding a home in Cowley County due in part to the workforce supplied by the two local colleges in the county. Both cities, only eleven miles apart, now have large [[Wal-Mart]] stores (a new Wal-Mart Supercenter opened in Arkansas City in March 2006, and another has been constructed in Winfield); conversely, both towns' (in Arkansas City <U+2013> the Burford, the Howard, and the Crest) movie theaters recently closed and were replaced by a single facility halfway between the cities, just south of the Strother Field industrial park. B & B Theatres donated the two downtown buildings to non-profit organizations in each of the respective communities. The Ark City Burford Theatre and Commercial Building is undergoing a transformation/renovation that will become a new community arts center and gathering space. Construction began in spring 2006 on the planned downtown revitalization streetscape.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}

In 2006, the local physicians in Arkansas City banded together with the South Central Kansas Regional Medical Center (SCKRMC) board and the City of Arkansas City to build a new hospital, which opened in March 2011.<ref name=wicheagle01>{{cite news|last=Siebenmark|first=Jerry|title=New hospital to open in Ark City|url=http://www.kansas.com/2011/03/13/1760942/new-hospital-to-open-in-ark-city.html|accessdate=June 25, 2011|newspaper=The Wichita Eagle|date=March 13, 2011}}</ref>

In 2010, the [[Keystone Pipeline|Keystone-Cushing Pipeline]] (Phase II) was constructed west of Arkansas City, north to south through [[Cowley County, Kansas|Cowley County]], with much controversy over tax exemption and environmental concerns (if a leak ever occurs).<ref>[http://www.gpace.org/news/marion-county-commission-calls-out-legislative-leadership-on-pipeline-deal/ Keystone Pipeline <U+2013> ''Marion County Commission calls out Legislative Leadership on Pipeline Deal''; April 18, 2010.]</ref><ref>[http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2010/dec/10/transcanada-inspecting-keystone-pipeline/ Keystone Pipeline <U+2013> ''TransCanada inspecting pipeline''; December 10, 2010.]</ref>
