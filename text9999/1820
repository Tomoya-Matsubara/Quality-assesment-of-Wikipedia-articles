'''Sir Albert John Gould''' (12 February 1847 &ndash; 27 July 1936) was an Australian politician and solicitor who served as the second [[President of the Australian Senate|President]] of the [[Australian Senate]].

A solicitor, businessman and citizen soldier before his entry into politics, Gould was a member of the [[New South Wales Legislative Assembly]] from 1882 to 1898, during which time he served as Minister for Justice in two [[Free Trade Party|Free Trade]] governments. He later served two years in the [[New South Wales Legislative Council]] from 1899 to 1901 until his election to the [[Australian Senate]]. Gould's interest in parliamentary procedure saw him become involved with the relevant standing committee and he was elected unopposed as the second President of the Senate in 1907. His tenure is remembered as more traditionalist and [[Anglophile|Anglophilic]] than his predecessor's.

Defeated by the [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] nominee in 1910 following the [[Commonwealth Liberal Party|Liberal]] government's defeat, Gould remained in parliament as a backbencher until 1917, when he retired after he was not re-endorsed by the [[Nationalist Party of Australia|Nationalist Party]]. He was active in community and religious affairs during his long retirement.

==Early life and career==

Gould was born in [[Sydney]], the son of solicitor John Morton Gould and his wife Anne (''n<U+00E9>e'' Livingstone). He attended [[William Woolls]]' school in [[Parramatta]], and went on to study law at the [[University of Sydney]], although he did not take a degree.<ref name=ADB>{{Australian Dictionary of Biography|last=McMinn|first=W.

Gould was also a citizen soldier, enlisting as a volunteer in the [[West Maitland]] company of the New South Wales volunteer forces. He later took command of the Singleton Company, becoming a [[major (rank)|major]] in 1886.<ref name=Senate/> He later received the [[Volunteer Officers' Decoration]] for long service; he would retire from the regiment in 1902 as a [[lieutenant-colonel]].<ref name=ADB/>

==State politics==

In 1882, Gould was elected to the [[New South Wales Legislative Assembly]] as the member for [[Electoral district of Patrick's Plains|Patrick's Plains]] (renamed [[Electoral district of Singleton|Singleton]] in 1894). Initially an opponent of the coalition associated with [[Henry Parkes]] and [[John Robertson (New South Wales Premier)|John Robertson]], he later supported Robertson's government in 1885.<ref name=ADB/> By 1887 he was supporting his career with his own legal practice in Singleton and Sydney, and when the party system came into being in New South Wales in that year he identified as a [[Free Trade Party|Free Trader]]. In 1889 he was appointed Minister for Justice under Parkes, serving until 1891; he held the position again under [[George Reid (Australian politician)|George Reid]] from 1894 to 1898.<ref name=Senate/> During the first period of his ministry he became involved in a dispute with the [[Chief Justice of New South Wales|Chief Justice]], [[Frederick Darley|Sir Frederick Darley]], over requests for improved court accommodation and a contested punishment for contempt of two witnesses. Despite embarrassing his premier, he remained close with Parkes throughout his state career and in later years frequently gave speeches in his memory.<ref name=ADB/>

Gould's career as justice minister was marked by consolidation of the law, tightening of licensing laws and reforms relating to police courts. A supporter of [[Federation of Australia|Federation]],<ref name=Senate/> he nevertheless opposed the 1898 bill, which he believed deprived New South Wales of adequate recognition.<ref name=ADB/> He was defeated in the election of that year, but in 1899 he was one of Premier Reid's twelve appointments to the [[New South Wales Legislative Council|Legislative Council]] that enabled the passage of the legislation for a referendum on Federation.<ref name=Senate/>

==Senate career==

Following Federation, Gould contested the [[Australian federal election, 1901|first federal election]] in March 1901, standing for the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] as a Free Trader. He was elected in the third of six positions, entitling him to a six-year term.<ref name=Psephos1901>{{cite web|last=Carr|first=Adam|title=1901 Senate - New South Wales|work=[[Psephos]]|url=http://psephos.adam-carr.net/countries/a/australia/1901/1901senatensw.txt|year=2011|accessdate=27 March 2011}}</ref> His first speech was largely devoted to his impassioned support for [[free trade]], and in his early years as a senator he also supported [[decentralisation]] and opposed proposals to establish a federal capital.<ref name=Senate/> A supporter of the [[White Australia policy]], he expressed concern over [[Kanakas|Kanaka]] labour in [[Queensland]], although his assumption that the arrangement was temporary enabled his pragmatism on this issue.<ref name=Senate/> Gould was also involved in defence matters, supporting the introduction of [[conscription]] and maintaining loyalty to the [[British Empire|Empire]], where "there are men much more experienced in the principles of government than we are".<ref name=Senate/> At the [[Australian federal election, 1906|1906 election]], Gould was easily re-elected in the first position,<ref name=Psephos>{{cite web|last=Carr|first=Adam|title=1906 Senate - New South Wales|work=[[Psephos]]|url=http://psephos.adam-carr.net/countries/a/australia/1906/1906senatensw.txt|year=2011|accessdate=27 March 2011}}</ref> winning the largest vote for any senator to that time.<ref name=Senate/>

From 1901 Gould maintained an interest in the procedure of the Senate, and was a member of the [[standing orders]] committee from its appointment in 1901 until 1907. He had supported the opening of Senate proceedings with prayer and had made frequent reference to the standing orders of the [[British House of Commons]].<ref name=Senate/> He contested the [[President of the Australian Senate|Presidency of the Senate]] in 1904, but was defeated by the incumbent, [[Richard Baker (Australian politician)|Sir Richard Baker]].<ref name=Senate/>

On Baker's retirement, Gould was unanimously elected President on 20 February 1907. He endeavoured to keep the Senate representative of the states' interests and free from party politics, and his rulings focused on unparliamentary language and relevance.<ref name=Senate/> Gould, appointed [[Knight Bachelor]] in 1908, differed from his predecessor in his adherence to British influence.<ref name=Evans>{{cite encyclopedia|last=Evans|first=Harry|author-link=Harry Evans (Australian Senate clerk)|editor-last=Millar|editor-first=Ann|title=Introduction|encyclopedia=The Biographical Dictionary of the Australian Senate|volume=1|pages=1-11|publisher=Melbourne University Press|date=2000|isbn=0 522 84921 0}}</ref> With the election of the [[Andrew Fisher|Fisher]] [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] Government in 1910, Gould was defeated by [[Harry Turley]] for the presidency.<ref name=Senate/>

Despite his support for conscription, Gould was not endorsed by the new [[Nationalist Party of Australia|Nationalist Party]] to contest the [[Australian federal election, 1917|1917 election]]. Deeply offended, Gould nevertheless elected to retire rather than run as an [[Independent (politician)|independent]] and split the Nationalist vote.<ref name=ADB/><ref name=Senate/>

==Later life==

In his retirement, Gould continued his community involvement. A director of the [[Royal Prince Alfred Hospital]] and the [[Royal Alexandra Hospital for Children]], he also served as a member and chancellor of the Sydney and [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] synods of the [[Church of England]].<ref name=ADB/> He died in July 1936 at [[Rose Bay, New South Wales|Rose Bay]] aged 89; he was survived by two sons and three daughters (his wife died in 1928; one daughter had also predeceased him).<ref name=Senate/> Gould was given a [[state funeral]] at [[St Andrew's Cathedral, Sydney|St Andrew's Cathedral]] and was buried at [[South Head, New South Wales|South Head]] Cemetery.<ref name=ADB/>
