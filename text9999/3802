'''Florence Martus''' (1868 <U+2013> 1943), aka '''"the Waving Girl"''', took it upon herself to be the unofficial greeter of all ships that entered and left the [[Port of Savannah]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], between 1887 and 1931. From her rustic home on [[Elba Island]], a tiny piece of land in the [[Savannah River]] near the [[Atlantic Ocean]], Martus would wave a handkerchief by day and a lantern by night. According to legend, not a ship was missed in her forty-four years on watch.  A statue of Martus by the sculptor [[Felix de Weldon]] has been erected in Morrell Park on the historic riverfront of [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]].

Many other legends endure about this woman, notably the following:
* The reason she greeted ships was because she had fallen in love as a young girl with a sailor and wanted to be sure he would find her when he returned.<ref name="pbs.org">[http://www.pbs.org/legendarylighthouses/html/satlgl.html#cockspur Legendary Lighthouses: Great Lighthouses-South Atlantic<!-- bot-generated title -->] at www.pbs.org</ref>
* Sailors would bring her gifts<ref name="pbs.org"/>
* When the captain of the ship that brought her memorial statue to Savannah arrived, he refused to accept payment because of his fond memories of Martus<ref>[http://www.softadventure.net/CharlestonSavannah.htm Charleston and Savannah<!-- bot-generated title -->] at www.softadventure.net</ref>
While these old tales may be accurate, there is no strong supporting evidence for any of them.

On September 27, 1943 [[Liberty ship]] SS ''Florence Martus'' was named in her honor.
