The '''New York Jets''' are a professional [[American football|football]] team headquartered in [[Florham Park, New Jersey]], representing the [[New York metropolitan area]]. The team is a member of the [[AFC East|Eastern Division]] of the [[American Football Conference]] (AFC) in the [[National Football League]] (NFL). In a unique arrangement for the league, the Jets share [[MetLife Stadium]] in [[East Rutherford, New Jersey]] with the [[New York Giants]]. The franchise is legally and corporately registered as '''New York Jets, LLC.'''<ref>{{cite web|title=New York Jets, LLC|url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=6468208|work=Bloomberg Businessweek|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5xcuGMw6R|archivedate=1 April 2011|accessdate=1 April 2011}}</ref>

The team was founded in 1959 as the '''Titans of New York''', an original member of the [[American Football League]]; later, the franchise joined the NFL in the [[AFL<U+2013>NFL merger]]. The team began to play in 1960 at the [[Polo Grounds]]. Under new ownership, the current name was adopted in 1963 and the franchise was relocated to [[Shea Stadium]] in 1964 and then to the [[Meadowlands Sports Complex]] in 1984. The Jets advanced to the playoffs for the first time in 1968 and went on to compete in [[Super Bowl III]] where they defeated the [[1968 Baltimore Colts season|Baltimore Colts]], becoming the first AFL team to defeat an NFL club in an [[Super Bowl|AFL-NFL World Championship Game]].<ref name="Year In Review: 1969">{{cite web|title=Year In Review: 1969|url=http://www.newyorkjets.com/team/history/1969.html|publisher=New York Jets|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6Bpfmrngk|archivedate=10 October 2012|accessdate=24 June 2010}}</ref> Since 1968, the Jets have appeared in the playoffs thirteen times, and in the [[AFC Championship Game]] four times, most recently losing to the [[2010 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Pittsburgh Steelers]] in [[2010-11 NFL playoffs|2010]].<ref>{{cite web|title=New York Jets Playoff History|url=http://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/nyj/playoffs.htm|publisher=Pro Football Reference|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5xj0cxHDe|archivedate=5 April 2011|accessdate=5 April 2011}}</ref> However, the Jets have never returned to the Super Bowl, making them one of three NFL teams to win their lone Super Bowl appearance, along with the [[New Orleans Saints]] and [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]].

When the AFL and NFL merged, the team fell into a state of mediocrity along with their star quarterback, Namath, who only had three successful post-merger seasons after injuries hampered much of his career. The Jets continued to spiral downward before enjoying a string of successes in the 1980s which, included an appearance in the 1982 AFC Championship Game.

The early 1990s saw New York struggling.<ref name="Early 1990s">Chastain, pp. 191<U+2013>198</ref> After firing coach [[Bruce Coslet]], owner [[Leon Hess]] hired [[Pete Carroll]] who struggled to a 6<U+2013>10 record and was promptly fired at the end of the season.<ref name="Early 1990s"/> Thereafter, [[Rich Kotite]] was selected to lead the team to victory; instead he led the Jets to the NFL's worst record for two consecutive years.<ref name="Early 1990s"/> Kotite stepped down at the end of his second season forcing the Jets to search for a new head coach.<ref name="Early 1990s"/>

Hess lured then-disgruntled [[New England Patriots]] head coach [[Bill Parcells]] to New York in 1997.<ref>{{cite web|title=Year In Review: 1997|url=http://www.newyorkjets.com/team/history/1997.html|publisher=New York Jets|accessdate=June 29, 2010}}</ref> Parcells led the team back to relevance and coached them to the [[1998-99 NFL playoffs|AFC Championship Game]] in 1998.<ref>{{cite web|title=Year In Review: 1998|url=http://www.newyorkjets.com/team/history/1998.html|publisher=New York Jets|accessdate=June 29, 2010}}</ref><ref name="Year In Review: 1999">{{cite web|title=Year In Review: 1999|url=http://www.newyorkjets.com/team/history/1999.html|publisher=New York Jets|accessdate=June 29, 2010}}</ref> Hess died in 1999 while the team, plagued by injuries, produced an eight win record, falling short of a playoff berth.<ref name="Year In Review: 1999"/> At the end of the season, Parcells stepped down as head coach deferring control to his assistant, [[Bill Belichick]]; Belichick immediately resigned and went on to accept the head coaching position with the Patriots.<ref>{{cite web|title=Year In Review: 2000|url=http://www.newyorkjets.com/team/history/2000.html|publisher=New York Jets|accessdate=June 29, 2010}}</ref>

==Ownership==

===Wismer===
Harry Wismer, a businessman, had been interested in sports for much of his life when he was granted a charter franchise in the American Football League.<ref name="H. Wismer">Chastain, pp. 41<U+2013>43</ref> A three-sport letterman, football, particularly, stuck with Wismer who went on to play for the University of Florida and Michigan State before a knee injury ended his playing career.<ref name="H. Wismer"/> Undeterred, Wismer began his career as a [[Sports commentator|broadcaster]] originally with Michigan State and become a pioneer of the industry. Later, as the Titans owner, Wismer formulated a league-wide policy which allowed broadcasting rights to be shared equally amongst the teams.<ref name="H. Wismer"/>

Wismer, who had previously had a 25% stake in the Washington Redskins, was interested in the American Football League and was given a franchise to develop in New York. Wismer, whose philosophy was who you knew mattered most, tried to make the team and the league a success.<ref name="H. Wismer"/> His efforts began to accrue debt as the Titans' first two seasons were mediocre with attendance dropping in the team's second year.<ref name="H. Wismer"/> The franchise was sold for $1 million to a five man syndicate headed by Sonny Werblin of the Gotham Football Club, Inc. in February 1963.<ref name="H. Wismer"/>

===Werblin syndicate===
Sonny Werblin graduated from Rutgers University and was employed by the [[Music Corporation of America]], eventually becoming president of the company's television division.<ref name="Werblin">Chastain, pp. 64<U+2013>66</ref> With a vast knowledge of media, Werblin was determined to put the spotlight on the team.<ref name="Werblin"/> His first order of business, after changing the team's name and jerseys, was to sign Joe Namath to an unprecedented contract.<ref name="Werblin"/> Werblin's gamble would later pay off as Namath, who become a public star, led the Jets on to victory in Super Bowl III, though by then Werblin had sold his stake in the team.<ref name="Werblin"/>

Werblin's partners, Townsend B. Martin, [[Leon Hess]], Donald C. Lillis, and [[Philip H. Iselin]], had a falling out with Werblin over the way the team was run<U+2014>though the franchise had begun to make a profit, Werblin was making all the policies and decisions himself with little or no input from his partners, much to their dismay.<ref name="Falling out">Sahadi, pp. 142<U+2013>145</ref> Though Werblin initially resisted their ultimatum to dissolve the partnership,<ref name="Falling out"/> Werblin agreed to be bought out in 1968.<ref name="Werblin"/> Werblin remained involved in the sports community and became the first chairman and CEO of the [[New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority]] where he helped to create the Meadowlands Sports Complex, including Giants Stadium.<ref name="Werblin"/>

===Hess===
Leon Hess became well known for his [[Hess Corporation]] gas stations; however, he also played an instrumental part in the development of the Jets during his tenure as co-owner and eventual sole owner. Hess had often fought for improvements while the team was a tenant at [[Shea Stadium]] but generally stayed away from football operations, allowing his coaches and general manager to make football-related decisions.<ref name="Hess">Chastain, pp. 154<U+2013>156</ref>

Becoming the team's majority stockholder in 1973, Hess bought Philip H. Iselin's share upon his death in 1976 after which only two of Hess' partners remained, Townsend Martin and Helen Dillon, who had inherited the stake from her father Donald Lillis, upon his death.<ref>{{cite news|title=Hess Family Hits Gusher In Jet Sale|url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2000-01-12/sports/18133738_1_jet-sale-jets-playoff-leon-hess|work=New York Daily News|author=Gola, Hank|date=January 12, 2000|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5xPRM1vhy|archivedate=March 23, 2011|accessdate=March 23, 2011}}</ref> Hess began to buy out the remaining partners in 1981 when he bought Martin's 25% stake for $5 million.<ref name="Buyout">{{cite news|title=Sports Business; For Hess's Estate, It's a jets.com|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E05E1DD123AF937A25752C0A9669C8B63|work=The New York Times|author=Sandomir, Richard|date=January 14, 2000|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5xPRZrcrA|archivedate=March 23, 2011|accessdate=March 23, 2011}}</ref> Hess bought Dillon's stake three years later for another $5 million, acquiring sole control of the team.<ref name="Buyout"/>

Hess had a passion for his team and took losses hard.<ref name="Hess"/> In 1995, following a mediocre 6<U+2013>10 season under [[Pete Carroll]], despite generally shying away from football operations, Hess announced "I'm 80 years old, I want results now" during a conference in which [[Rich Kotite]] was introduced as the team's new coach.<ref name="Hess"/> After two unsuccessful years with Kotite, Hess heavily involved himself in hiring [[Bill Parcells]] in hopes to see his team again reach the Super Bowl.<ref name="Hess"/> He did not live to see his dream realized as he died on May 7, 1999.<ref name="Hess"/>

===Woody Johnson===
With the team for sale, two potential buyers were found in [[Cablevision]] and philanthropist [[Woody Johnson]] whose grandfather, [[Robert Wood Johnson II]], expanded [[Johnson & Johnson]].<ref name="W. Johnson">{{cite news|title=Man in the News; Philanthropist and Fan|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C05E0DC173AF931A25752C0A9669C8B63|work=The New York Times|author=Sandomir, Richard|date=January 12, 2000|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5xPQjZ6Pl|archivedate=March 23, 2011|accessdate=March 23, 2011}}</ref> Johnson was unknown amongst the other NFL owners at the time of his $635 million purchase of the franchise.<ref name="W.

Johnson"/> Johnson has been considered to be an enabler who wants the best from his employees.<ref name="W. Johnson"/>

Much like Hess, Johnson left many of the football related decisions up to his management team and tended to avoid the spotlight. However, upon hiring head coach Rex Ryan, Johnson had an increased presence as he molded the Jets into his team.<ref name="W.

==Stadiums==
Owner Harry Wismer sought out a place for the team to play their home games but was only able to secure the dilapidated [[Polo Grounds]], which had not had a major tenant since the [[New York Giants (MLB)|New York Giants]] vacated the stadium in 1957.<ref name="Polo Grounds">Chastain, pp. 75<U+2013>76</ref> The Titans played their first four seasons at the stadium<U+2014>in the final season they were renamed the Jets.<ref name="Polo Grounds"/> The Titans shared the stadium with [[Major League Baseball|baseball's]] new expansion team, the [[New York Mets]], for two years before both teams moved to Queens in 1964.<ref name="Polo Grounds"/> The Jets hold the distinction of being the final team to host a game at the Polo Grounds, a 19<U+2013>10 loss to the [[Buffalo Bills]] on December 14, 1963.<ref name="Polo Grounds"/>

[[File:Shea Stadium exterior 1964.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Shea Stadium, 1964.]]
Wismer hoped the Titans could play in what would become known as [[Shea Stadium]] beginning in 1961.<ref name="Ryczek">Ryczek, pp. 158<U+2013>159</ref> However, funding difficulties and legal problems delayed construction of the stadium.<ref name="Ryczek"/> Wismer signed a [[memorandum of understanding]] in late 1961 to secure the Titans' new home.<ref name="Ryczek"/> That memorandum recognized that the Mets would have exclusive use of the stadium until they had completed their season. As the team moved to Shea under new ownership, they were, in most years, required to open the season with several road games, a problem made worse in 1969 and 1973 when the Mets had long playoff runs.<ref name="Ryczek"/><ref name="Chastain, Shea">Chastain, pp. 87<U+2013>88</ref>

Feeling that this arrangement put the Jets at a disadvantage, the team announced in 1977 that they would play two home games a year during the month of September at the Giants' new home in New Jersey, [[Giants Stadium]]. Litigation began between New York City and the Jets over the issue, and in the lawsuit's settlement, the city agreed to allow the Jets to play two September home games a season at Shea beginning in 1978 for the remaining six years in the Jets' lease. In 1977, the Jets were to play one September game at Giants Stadium and an October 2 game at Shea.<ref>{{cite news|title=Court Accord Keeps Football Jets at Shea Stadium|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10F11F63E5F15768FDDAE0A94DD405B878BF1D3&scp=3&sq=jets+giants+stadium+1978&st=p|work=The New York Times|author=Eskenazi, Gerald; McGowen, Deane|date=May 27, 1977|accessdate=November 10, 2010}}</ref>

In spite of these issues, majority owner Leon Hess was interested in renewing the team's lease at Shea, which was due to expire in 1983. Hess negotiated with New York mayor [[Ed Koch]].<ref name="Meadowlands">Eskenazi, pp.210<U+2013>212</ref> Hess wanted the city to redevelop the stadium to expand its capacity. He also hoped to renegotiate other aspects of the lease<U+2014>the Jets received no money from ticketholders parking at Shea. Hess's proposals met resistance from Koch.<ref name="Meadowlands"/> When negotiations reached an impasse, the Jets announced their intention to depart for New Jersey.<ref name="Meadowlands"/> On December 10, 1983 the Jets played their final game at Shea and lost to the Steelers 34<U+2013>7.<ref name="Chastain, Shea"/> As fans pillaged the stadium for mementos, the scoreboard read "N.J. Jets" in reference to the Jets's departure to the Meadowlands.<ref name="Chastain, Shea"/>

[[Image:WestSideStadium.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A model of the proposed West Side Stadium.]]
When the Jets joined the Giants at the stadium, many Jets fans hoped the name, Giants Stadium, would be changed. However, the Giants, who had the authority to approve the change, refused.<ref name="Meadowlands2">Chastain, pp. 72<U+2013>73</ref> In an effort to conceal the fact that they played in a stadium built and decorated for another team, the stadium grounds crew was assigned to make the stadium more Jet-friendly during Jets games by putting up green banners and placing the Jets' logo over the Giants'. No change could be made to the blue and red seating bowl.<ref name="Meadowlands2"/> The Jets were featured in the first NFL playoff game in the stadium's history, falling to the Patriots on December 28, 1985.<ref name="Meadowlands2"/>

As the Jets sought to become a stronger franchise and remove themselves from their counterparts' shadow, the team entered into negotiations with the [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority (New York)|Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] in an attempt to [[West Side Stadium|build a stadium]] on the west side of [[Manhattan]], entering a bidding war with TransGas Energy Systems and [[Cablevision]] for the rights to the [[West Side Yard]] property<U+2014>Hess, prior to his death, had been approached by former mayor [[Rudy Giuliani]] about bringing the team to the West Side when their lease at Giants Stadium expired in 2008.<ref name="West Side bid">{{cite news|title=N.F.L.

The rivalry began to escalate and receive increased media attention in 1997 when a disgruntled [[Bill Parcells]] vacated his head coaching position with New England to accept the same position with New York.<ref name="Transcendant rivalry"/> The following year, the Jets signed Pro Bowl running back [[Curtis Martin]] from the Patriots.<ref name="Transcendant rivalry"/> After the Jets declined during Parcells' third year, Parcells decided to resign as head coach.

A critical turning point of the rivalry took place on September 23, 2001 when Jets linebacker [[Mo Lewis]] tackled [[Drew Bledsoe]], leaving the veteran with [[internal bleeding]].

===Miami Dolphins===
{{main|Dolphins<U+2013>Jets rivalry}}

New York has maintained a rivalry with the [[Miami Dolphins]] since the Dolphins' inception in 1966. One of the most famous games in Jets history took place in 1994 when the Dolphins ran the [[The Clock Play|Fake Spike play]], giving them an improbable victory and halting the Jets' momentum that season, serving as a precursor to the Jets' next two unsuccessful years under Rich Kotite.<ref>{{cite news|title=Pro Football; The Spike Was a Fake, but the Damage to Jets' Season Is Real|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/28/sports/pro-football-the-spike-was-a-fake-but-the-damage-to-jets-season-is-real.html|work=The New York Times|author=Eskenazi, Gerald|date=November 28, 1994|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5voQ0CmtL|archivedate=January 17, 2011|accessdate=June 28, 2010}}</ref> The Jets went on to complete an improbable victory of their own on October 23, 2000 in what is known as [[The Monday Night Miracle (American football)|The Monday Night Miracle]].<ref name="MNM">{{cite web|title=MNF's Greatest Games: Miami-New York Jets 2000|url=http://espn.go.com/abcsports/mnf/s/greatestgames/miaminewyorkjets2000.html|publisher=ESPN|author=Diegnan, Mike|date=December 4, 2002|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5xMDRHyxY|archivedate=March 21, 2011|accessdate=March 21, 2011}}</ref> The Jets, trailing the Dolphins 30<U+2013>7 at the end of the third quarter, rallied in the fourth quarter scoring 23 unanswered points, eventually winning in overtime with a 40 yard [[John Hall (American football)|John Hall]] kick.<ref name="MNM"/>

Ewbank, Martin, Maynard, and Namath are recognized based upon their achievements with the Jets, although Ewbank previously coached the Baltimore Colts to NFL championships in 1958 and 1959. Riggins is recognized primarily for his seasons with the [[Washington Redskins]] (1976<U+2013>79, 81<U+2013>85), as is Monk (1980<U+2013>93), who won three Super Bowl championships with Washington. Lott is in the Hall of Fame primarily for his exploits as a member of the [[San Francisco 49ers]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Ronnie Lott|url=http://www.profootballhof.com/hof/member.aspx?player_id=134|publisher=Pro Football Hall of Fame|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5xpDPWTpI|archivedate=April 9, 2011|accessdate=April 9, 2011}}</ref>

Additionally, the Jets have not reissued [[Wayne Chrebet]]'s jersey (#80) after suffering a career-ending injury, though it has not been formally retired.

===Notable first-round draft picks===
{{For|more information|List of New York Jets first-round draft picks}}

Perhaps the most famous of the Jets' first round picks came in 1965 when they selected Alabama quarterback Joe Namath who boosted the Jets into the national spotlight with his boisterous personality and lifestyle.<ref name="Joe Willie">Chastain, pp. 1<U+2013>4</ref> His physical talents on the field helped improve the Jets' fortunes, leading them to victory over the Baltimore Colts in Super Bowl III.<ref name="Joe Willie"/> Though injuries hampered the latter part of Namath's career, he is best remembered, according to former teammate [[John Dockery]], as "a guy that came along and broke a lot of the conventions."<ref name="Joe Willie"/> Namath was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1985.<ref name="Joe Willie"/>

Perhaps one of the most disappointing players in Jets history was running back [[Blair Thomas]]. Thomas, who averaged 5.4 yards per carry at Penn State, was an intriguing prospect the Jets were interested in utilizing to help their cumbersome offense.<ref name=" B. Thomas">Chastain, pp. 222<U+2013>224</ref> Confident in their decision, the Jets drafted Thomas with the second overall pick in 1990, expecting him to be a solid player for years to come.<ref name=" B. Thomas"/> Thomas ran for only 620&nbsp;yards in 1990, and failed to meet the high expectations.<ref name=" B. Thomas"/> By the time Thomas left the team as an unrestricted free agent in 1993, he had rushed for 2,009 yards and only five touchdowns.<ref name=" B. Thomas"/> The 2008 first round pick, defensive lineman [[Vernon Gholston]], followed a similar path, failing to record a sack during his three-year tenure with the team.<ref>{{cite web|title=Jets cut Vernon Gholston, Ben Hartsock|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/new-york/nfl/news/story?id=6175578|publisher=ESPN|author=Cimini, Rich|date=March 2, 2011|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5wtWGDRhd|archivedate=March 2, 2011|accessdate=March 2, 2011}}</ref>
