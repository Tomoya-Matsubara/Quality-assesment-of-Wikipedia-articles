'''Frank Woodruff Buckles''' (February 1, 1901{{ndash}}February 27, 2011), born '''Wood Buckles''', was one of the last three surviving  [[World War I]] veterans in the world, and was the last living [[United States|American]] veteran of the war.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1361349/Americas-surviving-WW1-veteran-Frank-Buckles-dies-aged-110-years-old.html?ito=feeds-newsxml |title=America's last surviving veteran of World War I dies aged 110 years old|publisher=''[[Daily Mail]]''|date=2011-02-28}}</ref> At the time of his death, Buckles was also the oldest verified World War I veteran in the world, and the second-oldest male military veteran in the world.<ref name="ABCNews"/> Although not in the military at the time, Buckles spent the majority of [[World War II]] as a [[prisoner of war]].  After the world wars, he lived at [[Gap View Farm]], in [[Charles Town, West Virginia]], and was the Honorary Chairman of the [[World War I Memorial Foundation]].

==Life during the twentieth century==
Frank Buckles was born '''Wood Buckles''', February 1, 1901, the son of James C. and Theresa J. Buckles on a farm in [[Bethany, Missouri]].<ref name=certificate>{{Cite news|author=Duggan, Paul|date=2011-02-28|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/28/AR2011022800165.html|title=Last U.S. World War I veteran Frank W.

Buckles enlisted in the [[United States Army]] in August 1917, soon after the [[American entry into World War I|beginning of America's involvement in World War I]]. Only 16 years old at the time, Buckles was asked by his recruiter to show a birth certificate. Later Buckles said of that event:

{{Quote|I was just 16 and didn<U+2019>t look a day older. I confess to you that I lied to more than one recruiter. I gave them my solemn word that I was 18, but I<U+2019>d left my birth certificate back home in the family Bible. They<U+2019>d take one look at me and laugh and tell me to go home before my mother noticed I was gone. Somehow I got the idea that telling an even bigger whopper was the way to go. So I told the next recruiter that I was 21 and darned if he didn<U+2019>t sign me up on the spot! I enlisted in the Army on 14 August 1917.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.c-spanvideo.org/videoLibrary/clip.php?appid=597640309|title=CNN video of House Representative Ted Poe reading Buckles letter into the Congressional record|2010-02-03}}</ref>}}

Before being accepted into the United States Army, he was turned down by the [[United States Marines Corps|Marine Corps]] because of his slight weight and being under 21 and by the [[United States Navy|Navy]] for being [[Flat feet|flat-footed]].<ref>{{Cite news|author=Collins, Elizabeth and Lopez, Todd |date=2011-02-28|url=http://www.army.mil/-news/2011/02/28/52573-last-wwi-veteran-dies/|title=Last WWI veteran dies|publisher=''Army News Service''}}</ref>

In 1917, Buckles was sent to Europe on the [[RMS Carpathia|RMS ''Carpathia'']], which had rescued [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']] survivors five years earlier. While on the ''Carpathia,'' Buckles spoke with crew members who had taken part in the rescue of ''Titanic'' survivors. During the war Buckles served in England and France, driving [[ambulance]]s and [[motorcycle]]s for the Army's 1st [[Fort Riley]] Casual Detachment. After the [[Armistice with Germany (Compi<U+00E8>gne)|Armistice]] in 1918, Buckles escorted prisoners of war back to Germany. Following his discharge in 1920,<ref name=discharge /> he attended the dedication of the [[Liberty Memorial]] in [[Kansas City, Missouri]], in honor of those Americans who died in World War I, and he met [[General of the Armies|General]] [[John J.
