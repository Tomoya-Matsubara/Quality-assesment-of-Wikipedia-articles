The '''giant eland''' (''Taurotragus derbianus''), also known as the '''Lord Derby eland''', is an open-forest [[savanna]] [[antelope]].  A species of the family [[Bovidae]] and genus ''[[Taurotragus]]'', it was first described in 1847 by [[John Edward Gray]]. The giant eland is the largest species of antelope, with a body length ranging from {{convert|220|<U+2013>|290|cm|abbr=on}}. There are two [[subspecies]]: ''T.&nbsp;d.&nbsp;derbianus'' and ''T.&nbsp;d.&nbsp;gigas''. 

As a [[herbivore]], the giant eland eats grasses, foliage and branches. They usually form small [[herd]]s consisting of 15<U+2013>25 members, both males and females. Giant elands are not [[Territory (animal)|territorial]], and have large [[home range]]s. They are naturally alert and wary, which makes them difficult to approach and observe. They can run at up to {{convert|70|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} and use this speed as a defence against [[Predation|predators]]. Mating occurs throughout the year but peaks in the [[wet season]]. They mostly inhabit broad-leafed savannas, [[woodland]]s and [[glade (geography)|glade]]s.

The giant eland is native to [[Cameroon]], [[Central African Republic]], [[Chad]], [[The Democratic Republic of Congo]], [[Guinea]], [[Mali]], [[Senegal]], and [[South Sudan]]. It is no longer present in [[Gambia]], [[Ghana]], [[Ivory Coast]], and [[Togo]]. Its presence is uncertain in [[Nigeria]], [[Guinea-Bissau]], and [[Uganda]]. The subspecies have been listed with different conservation statuses by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN).

==Etymology==

The scientific name of the giant eland is ''Taurotragus derbianus'', derived from three words: ''tauros'', ''tragos'', and ''derbianus''. ''Tauros'' is [[Greek language|Greek]] for a bull or bullock.<ref>{{cite web|title=Taurus|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/taurus|work=Encyclopaedia Britannica|publisher=Merriam-Webster |accessdate=29 July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Harper|first=Douglas|title=Taurus|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=taurus|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=29 July 2012}}</ref> ''Tragos'' is Greek for a male goat, and refers to the tuft of hair that grows in the eland's ear which resembles a goat's beard.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tragos|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&search=tragos&searchmode=none|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=29 July 2012}}</ref> 

The giant eland is also called "Lord Derby's eland" in honour of [[Edward Smith-Stanley, 13th Earl of Derby|Edward Smith-Stanley]], the 13th [[Earl of Derby]]. It was due to his efforts that the giant eland was first introduced to England between 1835 and 1851. Lord Derby sent botanist [[Joseph Burke (botanist)|Joseph Burke]] to collect animals, either alive or dead, from South Africa for his museum and [[menagerie]]. The first elands introduced in England were a pair of common elands, and what would later be identified as a giant eland bull.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Glover, R.|title=The man who did not go to California|journal=Historical Papers|year=1975|volume=10|issue=1|pages=95<U+2013>112|doi=10.7202/030791ar|format=PDF|url=http://www.erudit.org/revue/hp/1975/v10/n1/030791ar.pdf}}</ref>  The details were recorded in Smith-Stanley's privately printed work, ''Cleanings from the Menagerie at Knowsley Hall''.<ref>{{cite book|author=Cook, John Douglas; Harwood, Philip; Pollock, Walter Herries; Harris, Frank; Hodge, Harold|title=The Saturday Review of Politics, Literature, Science and Art|publisher=John W Parker and Sons|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=FS8_AQAAIAAJ&pg=PA183|volume=7|page=183|chapter=The New Venison|date=February 12, 1859}}</ref>  The Latin name indicates that it "belonged to" (given by the suffix -''anus'') Derby, hence ''derbianus''.<ref name=uu>{{cite web|last=Huffman|first=B|title=Giant eland, Derby eland|url=http://www.ultimateungulate.com/Artiodactyla/Taurotragus_derbianus.html|publisher=Ultimate Ungulate|accessdate=29 July 2012}}</ref>

Although the giant eland is somewhat larger than the common eland, the epithet 'giant' actually refers to its large horns.<ref name=uu/><ref name="Taxon"/> The name 'eland' is [[Dutch language|Dutch]] for "elk" or "moose". It has a [[Baltic languages|Baltic]] source similar to the [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] ''<U+00E9>lnis'', which means "deer". It was borrowed earlier as ''ellan'' ([[French language|French]]) in the 1610s or ''elend'' ([[German language|German]]).<ref>{{cite web|title=Eland|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/eland?q=eland|work=[[Oxford University Press]]|publisher=Oxford Dictionaries|accessdate=29 July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Eland|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/eland|work=Encyclopaedia Britannica|publisher=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=29 July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Douglas|first=Harper|title=Eland|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=eland|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=7 August 2012}}</ref>

==Taxonomy==
[[File:Taurotragus derbianus gigas.jpg|thumb|Subspecies ''T. d. gigas'' in [[Cincinnati Zoo]]]]
The giant eland was first [[Species description|described]] in 1847 by [[John Edward Gray]], a British zoologist, who called it ''Boselaphus derbianus''.<ref name=MSW3>{{MSW3 Artiodactyla | id = 14200714 | page = 696}}</ref> At that time, it was also called the 'black-necked eland' and ''Gingi-ganga''.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Gray|first=J.E.|title=Description of a new species of Antelope from West Africa|journal=Journal of Natural History Series 1|date=1 October 1847|volume=20|issue=133|pages=286<U+2013>286|doi=10.1080/037454809496047}}</ref> 

Giant eland is placed in the genus ''[[Taurotragus]]'' of family [[Bovidae]]. Giant elands are sometimes considered part of the genus ''[[Tragelaphus]]'' on the basis of [[molecular phylogenetics]], but are usually categorized as ''Taurotragus'', along with the [[common eland]] (''T.&nbsp;oryx''). Giant eland and common eland are the only antelopes in the [[tribe (biology)|tribe]] ''Tragelaphini'' to be given a generic name other than ''Tragelaphus''.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Pappas, L.

The colour of the male's coat darkens with age. According to zoologist Jakob Bro-J<U+00F8>rgensen, the colour of the male's coat can reflect the levels of [[androgen]], a male hormone, which is highest during [[Rutting season|rutting]].<ref name=bio>{{cite web|title=Biological characteristics|url=http://www.gianteland.com/ginat-eland/biological-characteristic/|work=Czech University of Life Sciences|publisher=Giant eland conservation|accessdate=29 July 2012}}</ref> Comparing the subspecies, ''T.&nbsp;d.&nbsp;derbianus'' is characterised by 15 body stripes, smaller size, and a [[rufous]] colour, while ''T.&nbsp;d.&nbsp;gigas'' is larger, a sandy colour, and has 12 body stripes.<ref name="bio"/>

A crest of short black hair extends down the neck to the middle of the back, and is particularly prominent on the shoulders.

===Parasites===

Fecal studies of the western giant eland revealed the presence of a newly found species ''[[Eimeria derbani]]'', of genus ''[[Eimeria]]'', which consists of [[Apicomplexa]]n parasites. The [[sporulation]] lasted for two days at a temperature of {{convert|23|C|F}}. The species has been differentiated from ''[[Eimeria canna|E.&nbsp;canna]]'' and ''[[Eimeria triffittae|E.&nbsp;triffittae]]'', which parasitize the common eland (''T.&nbsp;oryx'').<ref name=parasite>{{cite journal |last=M<U+00E1>ca |first=O |title=Description of a new species of ''Eimeria'' Schneider, 1875 (Apicomplexa: Eimeriidae) from the western Derby eland ''Taurotragus derbianus derbianus'' Gray (Artiodactyla: Bovidae) in Senegal |journal=Systematic Parasitology|year=2012 |volume=82 |issue=2 |pages=121<U+2013>123 |pmid=22581248 |doi=10.1007/s11230-012-9352-0}}</ref> The giant eland is also parasitised by ''[[Carmyerius spatiosus]]'' (a [[trematode]] species), ''[[Taenia crocutae]]'' and ''[[Taenia hyaenae|T.&nbsp;hyaennae]]'' (two [[tapeworm]] species).<ref>{{cite web|title=''Taurotragus derbianus''|url=http://globalspecies.org/ntaxa/951388|work=Myers Enterprises|publisher=Global Species|accessdate=29 July 2012}}</ref>

==Genetics and evolution==

The giant eland has 31 male [[chromosome]]s and 32 female chromosomes. In a 2008 [[phylogenomics|phylogenomic]] study of spiral-horned antelopes, chromosomal similarities were observed between [[Bos taurus|cattle]] (''Bos taurus'') and eight species of spiral-horned antelopes, namely: [[nyala]] (''Tragelaphus angasii''), [[lesser kudu]] (''T.&nbsp;imberbis''), bongo (''T.&nbsp;eurycerus''), [[bushbuck]] (''T.&nbsp;scriptus''), [[greater kudu]] (''T.&nbsp;strepsiceros''), [[sitatunga]] (''T.&nbsp;spekei''), giant eland (''Taurotragus derbianus''), and common eland (''T.&nbsp;oryx''). It was found that chromosomes involved in [[Centromere|centric]] [[Fusion gene|fusion]]s in these species used a complete set of cattle [[Fluorescence in situ hybridization|painting probes]] generated by [[Laser capture microdissection|laser microdissection]]. The study confirmed the presence of the [[chromosome translocation]] known as [[Robertsonian translocation]] (1;29), a widespread evolutionary marker common to all known tragelaphid species.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rubes|first=J|coauthors=Kubickova, S; Pagacova, E; Cernohorska, H; Di Berardino, D; Antoninova, M; Vahala, J; Robinson, TJ|title=Phylogenomic study of spiral-horned antelope by cross-species chromosome painting |journal=Chromosome Research: An International Journal on the Molecular, Supramolecular and Evolutionary Aspects of Chromosome Biology |year=2008 |volume=16 |issue=7 |pages=935<U+2013>947 |doi=10.1007/s10577-008-1250-6 |pmid=18704723}}</ref>

An accidental mating between a male giant eland a female kudu produced a male offspring, but it was [[azoospermic]]. Analysis showed that it completely lacked [[germ cell]]s, which produce [[gamete]]s. Still, the hybrid had a strong male scent and exhibited male behaviour. Chromosomal examination showed that chromosomes 1, 3, 5, 9, and 11 differed from the parental [[karyotype]]s. Notable mixed inherited traits were pointed ears as the eland's, but a bit widened like kudu's. The tail was half the length of that of an eland with a tuft of hair at the end as in kudu.<ref name=jorge>{{cite journal|last=Jorge|first=W|coauthors=Butler, S; Benirschke, K|title=Studies on a male eland X kudu hybrid|journal=Journal of reproduction and fertility|year=1976|volume=46|issue=1|pages=13<U+2013>16|doi=10.1530/jrf.0.0460013|pmid=944778}}</ref>  

Previous genetic studies of African savanna [[ungulate]]s revealed the presence of a long-standing [[Pleistocene]] refugium in east and South Africa, which also includes the giant eland. The common eland and giant eland have been estimated to have diverged about 1.6 million years ago.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lorenzen|first=Eline D.|coauthors=Masembe, Charles; Arctander, Peter; Siegismund, Hans R.|title=A long-standing Pleistocene refugium in southern Africa and a mosaic of refugia in East Africa: insights from mtDNA and the common eland antelope |journal=Journal of Biogeography |year=2010 |volume=37 |issue=3 |pages=571<U+2013>581 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2699.2009.02207.x}}</ref>

Giant elands live in the broad-leafed savanna, woodlands, and glades of central and western Africa, which correspond to the two subspecies. They also live in forests as well as on the fringes of deserts. The giant elands can also live in deserts, as they produce very dry dung.<ref name = Burton>{{cite book | last = Burton | first = RM | title = International wildlife encyclopedia | year = 2002 | publisher = [[Marshall Cavendish]] | isbn = 0-7614-7266-5 | pages = 757<U+2013>759 | edition = 3 | chapter = Eland | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=0gsPc5lk7_UC&pg=PA757 }}</ref> They are found in southern Sudan and [[Central African Republic]] into northern [[Cameroon]] and southern [[Chad]].<ref name="Cavendish"/>

In the past, giant elands occurred throughout the relatively narrow belt of savanna woodland that extends across West and Central Africa from Senegal to the Nile. Today they are conserved in national parks and reserves, and occur mostly in Senegal. The western giant eland is largely restricted to [[Niokolo Koba National Park]] in Senegal. The eastern giant eland is found in several reserves, for example in [[B<U+00E9>nou<U+00E9> National Park]], [[Faro National Park]] and [[Bouba Njida National Park]] in Cameroon and in [[Manovo-Gounda St. Floris National Park]] in the Central African Republic.

==Diet==
[[File:Western Derby Eland (Taurotragus derbianus derbianus) 4.jpg|thumb|left|Giant eland is a herbivore]]
Primarily a herbivore, the giant eland eats grasses and foliage, as well as other parts of a plant.<ref name="eco"/><ref name="ap"/> In the rainy season, they browse in herds and feed on grasses. They can eat coarse, dry grass and weeds if nothing else is available. They eat fruits too, such as plums. A study in South Africa showed that an eland's diet consists of 75% shrubs and 25% grasses, with highly varying proportions. They often use their long horns to break off branches.<ref name=Burton/>

They need regular intake of water in their diet. That is the reason for their preference of a place with a water source nearby.<ref name="uu"/> However, some adaptations they possess help them to survive even in the lack of water by maintaining a sufficient quantity of it in their body. They produce very dry dung compared to domestic cattle. In deserts, they can get their required water from the moisture of [[succulent plant]]s. Another way in which they conserve water is by resting in the day, and feeding in the night, so that they minimize the water quantity required to cool themselves.<ref name=Burton/> 

Several studies have investigated the eland's diet. A study of giant elands in the Bandia Natural reserve in Senegal revealed that the most important and most preferred plants were ''[[Acacia]]'' species, ''[[Terminalia (plant)|Terminalia]]'' species, ''[[Azadirachta indica]]'', ''Combretum'' species, ''[[Danielia olliveri]]'', ''[[Lonchocarpus laxiflorus]]'', ''[[Maytenus senegalensis]]'', ''[[Prosopis africana]]'', ''[[Pterocarpus erinaceus]]'', ''[[Saba senegalensis]]'' and pods of ''[[Piliostigma thonningii]]''.<ref name="eco"/> Another study in [[Sudan]] showed that western giant elands preferred ''[[Cassia tora]]'' the most, and it was the most abundant [[legume]] there.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Galat |first=G<U+00E9>rard |coauthors=Galat-Luong, Anh; Nizinski, Jerzy J. |title=Diet preferences of a Western giant (Lord Derby's) eland group in a Sahelian dry habitat |journal=Animal Biology |year=2011 |volume=61 |issue=4 |pages=485<U+2013>492 |doi=10.1163/157075511x597610 |url=http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/10.1163/157075511x597610}}</ref> 

In 2010, [[histology|histological]] analysis of the feces of South African western giant elands was done in the Niokolo Koba National Park and in the Bandia National Reserve. In both studies leaves, shoots of woody plants, and fruits were found to be the three major components. The other components that appeared in minor proportions were [[forb]]s and grasses, generally below five percent of the mean fecal volume. They were seen eating most foliage from ''[[Boscia angusifolia]]'', ''[[Grewia bicolor]]'', ''[[Hymenocardia acida]]'', and ''[[Ziziphus mauritiana]]'', and the fruits of ''Acacia'' and ''[[Strychnos spinosa]]''. In the Bandia Reserve, differences in diet were marked among age classes. The conclusions were that in the dry season the eland was a pure browser, consuming grasses in small amounts.<ref name=ashton>{{cite book|last=Acton, Q.

==Reproduction==
[[File:Western Derby Eland (Taurotragus derbianus derbianus) 5.jpg|thumb|Two males fighting over dominance]]
Mating occurs throughout the year, but peaks in the wet season. Females reach sexual maturity at about two years, and males at four to five years. A female can remain in [[estrus]] for three days, and the estrous cycle is 21<U+2013>26 days long.<ref name="adw"/><ref name=nowak/> As in all antelopes, mating occurs at a time of food abundance.<ref name=estes2>{{cite book|last=[[Richard Despard Estes|Estes, R. D.]]|title=The Safari Companion: A Guide to Watching African Mammals Including Hoofed Mammals, Carnivores, and Primates|year=1999|publisher=Chelsea Green Publishing|isbn=1-890132-44-6|pages=23<U+2013>24}}</ref><ref name=nowak/> In some areas distinct breeding seasons exist. In southern Africa, females have been seen giving birth from August to October, and are joined by the males from late October to January. In [[Zambia]] calves are born in July and August.<ref name=nowak/>

Fights occur for [[Dominance (ethology)|dominance]], in which the bulls lock horns and try to twist the necks of their opponents. As an act during [[Rut (mammalian reproduction)|rut]], the males rub their foreheads in fresh urine or mud. They also use their horns to thresh and throw loose earth on themselves. The horns of older males get worn out due to rubbing them on tree barks.<ref name = Burton/> Expressions of anger are not typically observed.<ref name="uu"/> Dominant males may mate with multiple females. The [[courtship]] is brief, consisting of a penetration and one ejaculatory thrust.<ref name=estes2/> 

After the courtship, the [[Pregnancy (mammals)|gestational period]] begins, which is of nine months duration. The delivery usually takes place in the night, after which the mother ingests the [[afterbirth]].<ref name = Burton/> Generally one calf is delivered, and it remains with its mother for six months.<ref name="adw"/> [[Lactation]] can last for four to five months. After the first six months the young eland might join a group of other juveniles.<ref name=nowak>{{cite book|last=Nowak|first=Ronald M.|title=Walker's Mammals of the World (Vol. 2)|year=1999|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|isbn=0-8018-5789-9|edition=6th|pages=1143<U+2013>1145|chapter=Elands}}</ref>

A Senegalese study focused on the [[suckling]] behaviour of giant eland and common eland calves about one to five months old determined that suckling bouts increased with the age of the calves. No other change occurred in the farmed common eland calves, but in the giant eland calves, the males were found to suckle more than female ones and shorter suckling bouts were marked in [[Parity (biology)|primiparous]] mothers than multiparous ones. The results suggest that Derby elands that lived in their natural habitat adjusted their maternal behaviour so as to be able to readily maintain a vigilant lookout for predators and other similar risks. In contrast, the farmed common elands behaved as in the conditions of captivity, without predators.<ref name=Suckling>{{cite journal|last=Hejcmanov<U+00E1>|first=Pavla|coauthors=Vymyslick<U+00E1>, Pavla; Kol<U+00E1><U+010D>kov<U+00E1>, Karol<U+00ED>na; Anton<U+00ED>nov<U+00E1>, Mark<U+00E9>ta; Havl<U+00ED>kov<U+00E1>, Barbora; Stejskalov<U+00E1>, Michaela; Policht, Richard; Hejcman, Michal|title=Suckling behavior of eland antelopes (''Taurotragus'' spp.) under semi-captive and farm conditions|journal=Journal of Ethology |year=2011 |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=161<U+2013>168 |doi=10.1007/s10164-010-0241-1 |issn=1439-5444}}</ref>

==Populations==

The eastern giant eland ranged from [[Nigeria]], through Cameroon, Chad, the Central African Republic, and the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] (formerly Zaire) to Sudan and Uganda in 1980.<ref name=status/> But the [[rinderpest]] outbreak (1983<U+2013>1984) caused a devastating 60<U+2013>80% decline in the populations.<ref name=iucn/> The eastern giant eland is still found in extensive areas and is listed as '[[Least Concern]]' by the IUCN. It has many uninhabited habitats that are not expected to be occupied for human settlement, particularly in northern and eastern Central African Republic and south-western Sudan, where their population has notably increased.<ref name=status/> According to Rod East, 15,000 eastern giant elands existed as of 1999, of which 12,500 are in Central African Republic. The remaining areas are often disturbed by wars and conflicts<U+2014>activities that can lead to a rapid decline in the eastern giant eland's numbers if not controlled.<ref name=iucn/>

The western giant eland is in a more dangerous situation, being listed as '[[Critically Endangered]]' by the IUCN. Today they mostly occur in [[Senegal]]. In 1990, populations were about 1000, of which 700 to 800 were found in the Niokolo Koba National Park and the rest in the region around the [[Fal<U+00E9>m<U+00E9> River|Faleme River]].<ref name=Cavendish/><ref name=status>{{cite web|title=Status|url=http://www.gianteland.com/ginat-eland/status/|work=Czech University of Life Sciences, Institute of Tropics and Subtropics|publisher=Giant Eland Conservation|accessdate=29 July 2012}}</ref> As of 2008, a population of less than 200 individuals occur there, and only a few elands exist in neighboring countries.<ref name=iucn/>

A study of the long-term conservation strategy of the western giant eland was done in the Bandia and Fathala reserves, using demographic and pedigree data based on continuous monitoring of reproduction during 2000 to 2009. In 2009, the semi-captive population was 54 individuals (26 males, 28 females). The female breeding probability was 84%, and the annual [[population growth]] was 1.36. With more population, the elands were divided into five groups for observation. Although the mean interbreeding level became 0.119, a potential [[genetic diversity|gene diversity]] (GD) of 92% was retained. The authors concluded that with the introduction of new [[founder effect|founders]], the GD could be greatly improved in the next 100 years, and suggested that with proper management of the semi-captive population, the numbers of the western giant eland could be increased.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kol<U+00E1><U+010D>kov<U+00E1>|first=Karol<U+00ED>na|coauthors=Hejcmanov<U+00E1>, Pavla; Anton<U+00ED>nov<U+00E1>, Mark<U+00E9>ta; Brandl, Pavel|title=Population management as a tool in the recovery of the critically endangered Western Derby eland ''Taurotragus derbianus'' in Senegal, Africa|journal=Wildlife Biology|year=2011|volume=17|issue=3|pages=299<U+2013>310|doi=10.2981/10-019}}</ref>

==Threats and conservation==
[[File:Houston Giant Eland.jpg|thumb|right|At the Houston zoo]]
The major threats to the western giant eland population are overhunting for its rich meat and [[habitat destruction]] caused by the expansion of human and livestock populations.<ref name=iucn/> The eastern giant eland is also depleting for similar reasons, and natural causes like continued droughts and competition from domestic animals are contributing to the reduction in numbers. Populations of the eastern giant eland had already gone down due to the rinderpest attacks. The situation was worse during [[World War II]] and other civil wars and political conflicts that harmed their natural habitats.<ref name=Cavendish/>

The giant eland is already extinct in [[Gambia]], [[Ghana]], [[Ivory Coast]], and [[Togo]]. The western giant eland was once reported in Togo, but is believed to have been confused with the [[Bongo (antelope)|Bongo]] (''Tragalephaus eurycerus'').<ref name=iucn/> In 1970, it was reported eliminated in Uganda, during military operations.<ref name=Kingdon>{{cite book|last=[[Jonathan Kingdon]]|title=East African Mammals: An Atlas of Evolution in Africa|year=1989|publisher=Academic Press [u.a.]|isbn=0-226-43724-8|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=FCCyI0JHrPEC&pg=PA123|pages=123<U+2013>125|chapter=Derby's Eland}}</ref> Its presence is uncertain in Guinea-Bissau<ref name=Guinea-Bissau>{{cite book|last=East|first=compiled by R.|title=Antelopes: Part 3 - West and Central Africa: Global Survey And Regional Action Plans|year=1990|publisher=[[IUCN]]|isbn=2-8317-0016-7|page=35|chapter=Guinea-Bissau}}</ref> and Nigeria.<ref name=iucn/>

Today the western giant eland is conserved in the Niokolo Koba National Park and the Faheme Hunting Zone in Senegal. Field studies have proved that the Niokolo Koba National Park is ecologically suitable for the giant eland. As observed in the 2000 census of the Park, the number of deaths in a decade were only 90 to 150.<ref name=nezerkova>{{cite journal|last=Ne<U+017E>erkov<U+00E1>|first=P.|coauthors=H<U+00E1>jek, I.|title=Wildlife in National Park of Niokolo-Koba (Senegal) and its ecological background, with special regard to diet of Giant Eland.|journal=Agricultura Tropica et Subtropica|year=2000|volume=33|pages=44<U+2013>51|issn=0231-5742}}</ref> The eastern giant eland is conserved in the Faro National Park, Benoue National Park, Bouba Njida National Park, [[Bamingui-Bangoran National Park]] and Manovo-Gounda-St Floris National Park. They are bred in captivity in the Bandia Reserve (Senegal) and [[Fathala Reserve]] (Senegal).<ref name=iucn/>

==Uses==
Giant elands give large quantities of tender meat and high-quality hides even if fed a low-quality diet. These are game animals and are also hunted for trophies. Their milk is comparatively richer in [[dietary protein|protein]]s and [[milkfat]] than dairy cows, which can be an explanation for the quick growth of eland calves.<ref name="ap"/><ref name=Burton/> Eland's milk has about triple the fat content and twice the protein of a dairy cow's milk.<ref name=nowak/> Its docility and profitable characteristics have made it a target of domestication in Africa and Russia and has also resulted in hunting.<ref name="adw"/><ref name=sykes/>

Many people prefer to domesticate eland rather than domestic cattle due to their numerous benefits. Elands can survive in the scarcity of water, a great advantage over domestic cattle. They can also eat coarse grasses, and can even manage to ingest some poisonous plants that can prove fatal for cattle. They are also immune to some diseases that cattle may succumb to.<ref name=Burton/>
