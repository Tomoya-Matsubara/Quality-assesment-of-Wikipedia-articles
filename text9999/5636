The '''University of California, Riverside''' ('''UCR''' or '''UC Riverside''') is a [[public university|public]] [[research university]] and one of the 10 general campuses of the [[University of California]] system. The main campus sits on {{convert|1200|acre|ha|0|sp=us}} in a suburban district of {{USCity|Riverside|California}}, United States, with a branch campus of {{convert|20|acre|ha|0|sp=us}} in [[Palm Desert, California|Palm Desert]]. Founded in 1907 as the [[UC Citrus Experiment Station]], Riverside, pioneered research in [[biological pest control]] and the use of [[plant hormone|growth regulators]] responsible for extending the [[citrus]] growing season in California from four to nine months. Some of the world's most important research collections on [[University of California, Riverside Citrus Variety Collection|citrus diversity]] and [[Entomology Research Museum|entomology]], as well as science fiction and [[UCR/California Museum of Photography|photography]], are located at Riverside.

UCR's undergraduate [[UCR College of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences|College of Letters and Science]] opened in 1954. The [[Regents of the University of California]] declared UCR a general campus of the system in 1959, and graduate students were admitted in 1961. To accommodate an enrollment of 21,000&nbsp;students by 2015, more than $730&nbsp;million has been invested in new construction projects since 1999.<ref name="UCR factsheet">{{cite web | title=UCR Factsheet | url=http://www.ucr.edu/about/factsheet.html | publisher= University of California, Riverside | accessdate=2007-08-22| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070820032842/http://www.ucr.edu/about/factsheet.html| archivedate = August 20, 2007}}</ref><ref name="UCRFacts2007">{{cite web | title=UCR Facts and Impacts 2007| url=http://www.ucr.edu/about/facts.html | publisher= University of California, Riverside |accessdate= 2007-08-20}}</ref> Preliminary accreditation of the UCR School of Medicine was granted in October 2012 and the first class was enrolled in August 2013.

UCR's sports teams are known as the Highlanders and play in the [[Big West Conference]] of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]]. Their nickname was inspired by the high altitude of the campus, which lies on the foothills of [[Box Springs Mountain]]. The UCR women's basketball team won back to back Big West championships in 2006 and 2007. In 2007, the men's baseball team won its first conference championship and advanced to the regionals for the second time since the university moved to Division I in 2001.

[[Image:A Gary Anderson Graduate School of Managment.JPG|thumb|left|The original UC Citrus Experiment Station which now houses the [[A. Gary Anderson Graduate School of Management]] at the [[UCR School of Business Administration]].]]

At the turn of the 20th century, [[Southern California]] was a major producer of citrus, the region's primary [[export|agricultural export]]. The industry developed from the country's first [[navel orange]] trees, planted in [[Riverside, California|Riverside]] in 1873. Lobbied by the citrus industry, the UC Regents established the UC Citrus Experiment Station (CES) on February 14, 1907, on {{convert|23|acre|ha|0|sp=us}} of land on the east slope of [[Mount Rubidoux]] in Riverside. The station conducted experiments in [[fertilization (soil)|fertilization]], [[irrigation]] and [[crop]] improvement. In 1917, the station was moved to a larger site, {{convert|475|acre|ha|0|sp=us}} near Box Springs Mountain.<ref name="citrus">{{cite book | last = Ruther | first = Walter | coauthors= E.

The 1944 passage of the [[Servicemen's Readjustment Act (USA)|GI Bill]] during [[World War II]] set in motion a rise in college enrollments that necessitated an expansion of the state university system in California. A local group of citrus growers and civic leaders, including many [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]] alumni, lobbied aggressively for a UC-administered [[liberal arts college]] next to the CES. State Senator Nelson Dilworth, former Assemblyman Philip L. Boyd and Riverside State Assemblyman John Babbage were instrumental in shepherding the legislation through the State Legislature.<ref name="Timeline">{{cite press release | title=University of California, Riverside Campus Timeline | url=http://www.info.ucr.edu/announce/20020722timeline.html | year=2002 | publisher=UCR News | accessdate=2008-01-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=Gabbert Oral History transcript | url=http://www.ucrhistory.ucr.edu/pdf/gabbert.pdf | format=PDF | publisher=University of California, Riverside, Oral History Project | date=1998-04-02 |accessdate=2007-08-22}}</ref> Governor [[Earl Warren]] signed the bill in 1949, allocating $2&nbsp;million for initial campus construction.<ref name="Lovekin">{{cite journal | last=Lovekin | first=Kris | title= Enjoying Our Past | journal=Fiat Lux | volume=14 | issue=2 | pages=14<U+2013>17 | publisher= University of California, Riverside | month= February | year= 2004 | url=http://www.fiatlux.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/display.cgi?id=583 | accessdate= 2007-08-22}}</ref>

East Campus, occupying approximately {{convert|600|acre|ha|0|sp=us}}, hosts the core cluster of academic buildings and services. The original buildings that formed the earliest kernel of the campus included the UC Citrus Experiment Station, residential buildings, and barn, all of which are still in use. They were designed by Lester H. Hibbard, in association with H.B. Cody. Built by 1917 at a cost of $165,000, the [[architecture]] of the major buildings followed the [[Mission Revival Style architecture|Mission Revival]] style suggesting the Spanish colonial heritage of Southern California.<ref name="LongRangePlan2005" />

[[Image:Bell Tower, UCR.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The [[Carillon]] [[Bell tower|Bell Tower]] is the dominant landmark in the center of the main campus.]]
Further major construction largely ceased on the site until the groundbreaking for the College of Letters and Science (CHASS) in April 1951. A group of five buildings designed by different architects in a decidedly more [[Modern architecture|Modern]] style were completed by 1954: the Rivera Library, Webber Hall, Geology Building, Physical Education Building and Watkins Hall. After the Regents declared UCR a "general campus" of the UC system in 1958, many new buildings and additions were laid out over the following decade. Following an east<U+2013>west axis, new student residence halls and athletic facilities were developed along the southeastern quadrant of the main campus, while academic and research facilities were built along the central campus area closer to the freeway.<ref name="LongRangePlan2005" /> The Bell Tower, one of only five [[carillon]]s in California, was built in this period. Designed by [[A. Quincy Jones]], the tower is {{convert|161|ft|m|abbr=on}} tall and contains 48&nbsp;bells, each weighing from {{convert|28|lb|kg}} to {{convert|5091|lb|kg}}, covering four&nbsp;chromatic [[octave]]s.<ref>{{cite web | title= History of the Bell Tower | publisher= UCR Bell Tower Fund | url= http://www.belltower.ucr.edu/subpage.php?content=history.html | accessdate= 2007-08-23}}</ref>

[[File:UCR Belltower night.JPG|thumb|UCR Bell Tower at night]]After the drop in enrollment and subsequent restructuring of academic programs in 1970s, little capacity construction was undertaken over the next two decades. However, enrollment growth in the late 1980s justified considerable further campus expansion over the 1990s.

As a campus of the University of California system, UCR is governed by a [[Regents of the University of California|Board of Regents]] and administered by a president. The current president is [[Janet Napolitano]], and the [[Chancellor (education)|administrative head]] of UCR is Kim Wilcox. UCR's academic policies are set by its Academic Senate, a legislative body composed of all UCR faculty members.<ref>{{cite web | title=The Duties and Structure of the Academic Senate: A Brief Review, Academic Senate Office | publisher=University of California, Riverside | url=http://www.senate.ucr.edu/senate_site/cms.php?node=duties_and_structure | accessdate=2008-01-06| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071106102624/http://www.senate.ucr.edu/senate_site/cms.php?node=duties_and_structure| archivedate = November 6, 2007}}</ref>

UCR is organized into four academic colleges, two professional schools, and several interdisciplinary divisions. UCR's liberal arts college, the College of Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences, was founded in 1954, and began accepting graduate students in 1960. The [[College of Natural and Agricultural Sciences]], founded in 1960, incorporated the CES as part of the first research-oriented institution at UCR; it eventually also incorporated the natural science departments formerly associated with the liberal arts college to form its present structure in 1974.<ref name="Hinderaker" /> UCR's newest academic unit, the Bourns College of Engineering, was founded in 1989.<ref>{{cite press release | title= UC Riverside College of Engineering Hires Thirteen New Faculty Members | url = http://www.newsroom.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/display.cgi?id=717 | date=2003-12-22 | publisher = University of California, Riverside | accessdate = 2007-12-07}}</ref><ref>.

===Economic and research impact===
UCR operated under a $435&nbsp;million budget in fiscal year 2005<U+2013>06. The state government provided $153&nbsp;million, student fees accounted for $111&nbsp;million, the federal government financed $84&nbsp;million, and $45&nbsp;million came from university sales and services. Private support and other sources accounted for the remaining $18&nbsp;million. Overall, monies spent at UCR have an economic impact of nearly $1&nbsp;billion in California.<ref name="UCRFacts2007" /> Faculty members received nearly $87&nbsp;million in research funding in 2005<U+2013>06, mostly from federal agencies such as the [[National Science Foundation]] and the [[National Institutes of Health]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Sponsored Programs Activity, Fiscal Year 2006 Annual Summary Report| publisher= University of California, Riverside, Office of Research | year= 2006 |

Admission to UC Riverside is rated as "more selective" by ''[[U.S. News & World Report]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/university-of-california-riverside-1316|title=University of California-Riverside |year=2013|accessdate=2012-11-15|publisher=[[U.S. News and World Report]]}}</ref>

In 2006, 43.4&nbsp;percent of admitted students were first generation college students, 38.7&nbsp;percent came from low family income backgrounds, and 24&nbsp;percent graduated from low-performing high schools as measured by [[Academic Performance Index]] (API) scores.<ref>{{cite web | title=California Freshman Admit Profile Fall 2004, 2005, 2006 | url=http://www.ucop.edu/news/factsheets/2006/freshman_admit_profile_2006.pdf | format = PDF | publisher = University of California | accessdate=2006-08-22}}</ref> Enrollment in the fall of 2007 totaled 17,187&nbsp;students, 15,041&nbsp;undergraduates and 2,146&nbsp;postgraduates.

According to statistics released by the Education Trust, a national nonprofit, in 2005 UC Riverside graduated 65.3&nbsp;percent of its students in six years, a figure consistent with national averages but behind the average set by the top five public research universities by as much as 22&nbsp;percent.<ref>{{cite web | title=Measuring Up 2006, The National Report Card on Higher Education | url=http://measuringup.highereducation.org/_docs/2006/NationalReport_2006.pdf |format=PDF | publisher=The National Center for Public Policy and Higher Education | accessdate = 2007-08-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=University of California, Riverside, Graduation Rates | url=http://www.collegeresults.org/search1a.aspx?InstitutionID=110671 | publisher=The Education Trust | accessdate= 2007-08-10}}</ref> However, UCR's consistency with the national average is well above the median of 39&nbsp;percent for low-income-serving institutions as calculated in 2006 by the [[National Center for Education Statistics]], making the campus a model for successful approaches to [[Diversity (politics)|diversity]] in higher education.<ref name="Hebel"/>

Much of the student life on campus revolves around extensive local outreach and retention programs. Riverside enrolls the highest percentage of African American students of any of the 10 UC campuses and the second highest percentage of Latino students after Merced, prompting the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' and ''[[New York Times]]'' to run stories lauding UCR as a "campus of choice" for minority students.<ref name="LAT011507"/><ref name="Traub">

===Housing===
[[Image:Sunset, UCR.jpg|thumb|The [[Box Springs Mountains]] at dusk from the Pentland Hills [[residence hall]].]]
UCR's residence halls consist of three structures<U+2014>Aberdeen-Inverness, Lothian, and Pentland Hills<U+2014>which as of 2002 housed 2,930&nbsp;students in triple, double and single rooms. In addition, UCR features several on-campus [[apartment complex]]es such as Stonehaven, Bannockburn Village, University Plaza, Falkirk, Oban, Glen Mor and International Village, which together house 959&nbsp;students. UCR also offers student family housing at Canyon Crest, a low-density residential community that serves 268 and is slated for demolition to make room for higher-density residence halls.<ref name="LongRangePlan2005" /> Glen Mor, an apartment housing complex adjacent to Pentland Hills, was opened in 2007, and the university also purchased a nearby apartment complex, which is now known as Falkirk, for student housing in 2007.<ref name="HighlanderRidge">{{cite press release | title=UC Riverside Buys University House at Highlander Ridge | url=http://www.newsroom.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/display.cgi?id=1575 | publisher=University of California, Riverside | date=2007-04-27 | accessdate=2008-01-03}}</ref> About half of the student population lives in off-campus apartments, one-fourth commute, and one-fourth live on campus.<ref name="HighlanderRidge"/> Thirty percent of students remain on campus for the weekend.<ref name="University of California, Riverside, campus life">{{cite web | title= University of California, Riverside, campus life | url= http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/usnews/edu/college/directory/brief/drlife_1316_brief.php | work= [[US News and World Report]] | accessdate= 2007-08-22}}</ref>

Reflecting UCR's diversity, a number of residence halls have been established for specific social, cultural and academic needs. Ethnic and gender-oriented theme halls include ''Unete a Mundo'', for students seeking to support Latino or Chicano students in acclimating to life at UCR; a [[UCR Pan African Theme Hall|Pan African Theme Hall]] for students interested in developing consciousness of African culture in relation to other cultures of the world; and Stonewall Hall, dedicated to students of all gender identities and sexual orientations who wish to live in a [[gender-neutral]] community.

Student media organizations include ''The Highlander'' student newspaper, currently published every Tuesday during the academic year. First published in 1954, the Highlander remains an independent student media outlet. It was an entirely self-funded organization until 2001, when ASUCR passed a funding referendum for it. Student fees from the referendum go towards overhead and printing costs, however the Highlander is primarily funded through its own advertising revenue.<ref>{{cite web | title= Highlander Referendum, 2001 | publisher= Associated Students of the University of California, Riverside |url=http://www.elections.ucr.edu/2001/Referenda/highlanderreferenda.html | accessdate= 2007-08-22| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060904172637/http://www.elections.ucr.edu/2001/Referenda/highlanderreferenda.html| archivedate = September 4, 2006}}</ref> In 2003, the Highlander published a comic depicting a stereotypical [[Asian American]] graduate teaching assistant with poor English skills, inciting community backlash and prompting an apology from Editor-in-Chief Kahlil Ford.<ref>{{cite conference | last=Healy | first=Scott.

On-campus entertainment events are planned by a 14-member Associated Students Program Board (ASPB), comprising six student-run divisions that include concerts, films and lectures, cultural events and special events, as well as a marketing and leadership division. ASPB's major events include the Block Party Concert, Student Film Festival, International Film Festival, World Fest, Welcome Week, Homecoming and Spring Splash.<ref>{{cite web | title= ASPB | publisher= University of California, Riverside | url=http://www.aspb.ucr.edu | accessdate= 2007-08-22}}</ref>

Still other on-campus events take place at The Barn, one of the original buildings on campus grounds. Throughout the 60s', 70s' and 80s' popular up and coming bands played at The Barn including No Doubt and Radiohead. During the 90s' however, the university administration sought to avoid a "party school" stigma and did away with the concerts and events and remodeled the facility into a restaurant, The Big West Bar and Grill. As recently as the fall of 2007, concerts returned to The Barn and efforts are underway to rejuvenate it and once again make it into an on-campus venue attracting students as well as the larger university community.

The Graduate Student Association of the University of California, Riverside (GSAUCR) is ASUCR's counterpart on the graduate level. It is guided by a Graduate Student Council consisting of representatives from every department on campus. GSAUCR assesses fees required of all graduate students and uses them to fund research awards and colloquiums, conference travel grants, and speaker funds.<ref>{{cite web | title=GASUCR, About the Council| publisher= Graduate Student Association of the University of California, Riverside | url=http://www.gsa.ucr.edu/Council.html |accessdate= 2007-08-23}}</ref>

UCR's [[varsity team]]s compete in the Big West Conference of NCAA Division I. Programs include men's and women's soccer, cross country, basketball, track and field, baseball, softball, tennis, golf and women's volleyball. After students voted to assess themselves $35 a quarter to fund the athletic programs in 1998, men's and women's soccer and golf were added, and the athletic department switched from [[NCAA Division II]] in 2000.<ref name="Division I"/> While at Division II level, UCR produced 5 national championship teams in men's baseball and women's volleyball.
