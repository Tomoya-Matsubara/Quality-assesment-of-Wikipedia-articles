The '''John Olness House''' is a house in [[Kragnes Township, Clay County, Minnesota]], just north of [[Moorhead, Minnesota|Moorhead]] on [[U.S. Route 75]].  The house is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] as an example of a link between the farm communities and the farm-related businesses in [[Clay County, Minnesota|Clay County]].  The architecture shows influences of the [[Queen Anne architecture|Queen Anne style]], which stands out in Clay County because most buildings were in the local [[vernacular architecture|vernacular style]].  The owner, John Olness, was a successful farmer, and he also owned several businesses in the nearby community of Kragnes, including the local [[grain elevator]] and [[lumber yard]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nr.nps.gov/multiples/64000348.pdf|title=Clay County MRA|date=January 1980|accessdate=2009-03-25}}</ref>

The house received media attention during the [[2009 Red River Flood]].  On March 24, 2009, Owner Jeremy Kuipers discovered that the floodwaters had overcome a dike along a county road and surrounded the house.  Dozens of volunteers filled [[sandbag]]s and built a dike around the house.  The floodwaters are expected to threaten the house for the next two weeks before subsiding.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.startribune.com/local/41795247.html|title=No man is an island, but his house is one|publisher=[[Minneapolis Star Tribune]]|first=Richard|last=Tsong-Taatarii|date=March 24, 2009|accessdate=2009-03-25}}</ref>
