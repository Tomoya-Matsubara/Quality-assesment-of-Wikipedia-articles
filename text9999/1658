'''Robert Richard Chappuis''' (born [[February 24]] [[1923]] in [[Toledo, Ohio]]) is a former [[College Football All-America Team|All-American]] [[American football|football]] player who played for the [[University of Michigan]] [[Michigan Wolverines football|Wolverines]] in 1942, 1946, and 1947. His college years were interrupted by service in the [[U.S. Army Air Forces]] during [[World War II]]. Chappuis flew 21 missions as a [[radio operator]] and [[air gunner|aerial gunner]] on [[B-25 Mitchell|B-25 bombers]] in the [[European Theatre of World War II|European Theater]]. His aircraft was shot down in February 1945 in the [[Lombardy]] region of Northern Italy. Chappuis [[parachute]]d from the plane before it crashed and was rescued by [[Italian resistance movement|Italian partisans]] who hid Chappuis and two other crew members for three months until the end of the war.

After the war, Chappuis returned to Michigan where he broke the [[Big Ten Conference|Big Nine Conference]] record for total yards of offense in 1946 and then broke his own record in 1947.  He led the [[1947 Michigan Wolverines football team|1947 Michigan team]] known as the <U+201C>Mad Magicians<U+201D> to an undefeated season and a 49&ndash;0 win over the [[USC Trojans football|USC Trojans]] in the [[1948 Rose Bowl]] game. Chappuis was a unanimous [[College Football All-America Team|All-American]] selection in [[1947 in sports|1947]] and was named the Most Valuable Player of the 1948 Rose Bowl. His picture appeared on the cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine in 1947 in connection with a feature article about Chappuis and the 1947 Wolverines. During his career he established many football records that lasted for over a generation. He continues to hold the Big Ten Conference single-season [[passer rating]] record and the [[Michigan Wolverines]] single-season yards/completion records.

Chappuis played professional football in the [[All-America Football Conference]] for the [[Brooklyn Dodgers (football)|Brooklyn Dodgers]] and [[Chicago Hornets]] in 1948 and 1949. He led the Dodgers in total offense in 1948 with 1,402 yards passing and 310 yards rushing. When both clubs and the AAFC folded, Chappuis retired from football in 1950.  He was elected to the [[College Football Hall of Fame]] in [[1988 in sports|1988]].

==Early years==
Chappuis grew up in [[Toledo, Ohio]], where his father was an executive with a [[porcelain]] products company who had played [[quarterback]] for [[Denison University]], located near [[Columbus, Ohio]].<ref name=Specialist/> Chappuis graduated from [[DeVilbiss High School (Toledo, Ohio)|DeVilbiss High School]] where he was a star football player.<ref name=Rustling/> When it came time to choose a college, his father said he did not care where his son went <U+201C>so long as it wasn't [[Ohio State Buckeyes football|Ohio State]].<U+201D><ref name=Specialist/>  According to Chappuis, <U+201C>Dad just didn't like Ohio State.<U+201D><ref name=Specialist/>

==College football in 1942==
Chappuis played in nine games for Michigan as a [[sophomore]] in 1942, contributing 220 yards rushing, 358 yards passing, and 30 yards receiving.<ref name=Bentley>{{cite web|title=Bentley Library: Bob Chappuis|url= http://bentley.umich.edu/athdept/football/fballam/aachappu.htm|publisher=The Regents of the University of Michigan}}</ref> In his first game as a college halfback, Chappuis completed seven of eighteen passes for a gain of 80 yards, and also rushed for 49 yards in a 9&ndash;0 win over the [[Naval Station Great Lakes|Great Lakes Naval Training Station]].<ref name=Rustling>{{cite news|author=Davies, Russ|title=Rustling Thru Sports: Chappuis fits The Bill|publisher=The Chronicle-Telegram (Elyria, Ohio)|date=1942-10-02}}</ref>  Chappuis' predecessor as Michigan's halfback, [[Heisman Trophy]] winner [[Tom Harmon]], completed seven passes in a single game only three times in three years, a feat accomplished by Chappuis in his first game.<ref name=Rustling/>

==Service in World War II==
[[Image:B-25J Bomber.jpg|200px|thumb|left|[[B-25 Bomber]]]]
Chappuis' college program was interrupted by military service from 1943&ndash;1945. During [[World War II]], Chappuis served in the [[U.S. Army Air Forces]] and flew 21 missions as a [[radio operator]] and [[air gunner|aerial gunner]] in [[B-25 Mitchell|B-25 bombers]].<ref name=Eck/><ref name=Veterans/>  He flew his first mission targeting a railroad bridge in the heavily-fortified [[Brenner Pass]] on Christmas Day 1944.<ref name=Specialist/> On [[February 13]] [[1945]], Chappuis flew his 21st mission when he was assigned to fill in for a sick crew member.<ref name=Tosi>{{cite news|title=<U+2019>M<U+2019> All-American At Tosi<U+2019>s: Chappuis<U+2019> Life Story Like Movie Script|publisher=The Herald-Palladium (Benton Harbor-St. Joseph, Mich.)|date=1975-08-19}}</ref>  Chappuis<U+2019> B-25 bomber was assigned to bomb a railroad tunnel in the Italian mountains north of the [[Po River]]. <U+201C>Over the target, a burst of [[flak]] knocked out one engine, then the other engine went out. When the order came to bail out, the [[Tail gunner|tailgunner]] went out first, and got stuck in the escape hatch, pinned against the rear of it by the wind pressure. Chappuis kicked him in the only accessible place<U+2014>his head <U+2013> and knocked him loose.  Then he jumped.<U+201D><ref name=Specialist/>

Chappuis was rescued by an by [[Italian resistance movement|Italian partisan]], Aldo Comucci.<ref name=Tosi/> Comucci was 21 years old at the time and was in charge of one of the many underground groups operating in the area.<ref name=Tosi/> Comucci and his band of [[Italian resistance movement|resistance fighters]] got to Chappuis before the Germans and hid him and two other American flyers from the same plane for nearly three months until the end of the war.<ref name=Tosi/> The partisans passed Chappuis and the two other Americans from house to house, and village to village, toward the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] frontier.<ref name=Eck/><ref name=Specialist/> Dressed in shawls <U+2014> but still wearing [[GI (military)|G.I.]] shoes <U+2014> they once walked undetected past a German [[sentry]].<ref name=Specialist/>   

Chappuis and his crewmates finally wound up in a home in the small town of [[Asola (Italy)|Asola, Italy]], in the [[Province of Mantua]], [[Lombardy]], about 40 miles from [[Milan]]. The German headquarters was two houses away, and the drill grounds were across the street. Accordingly, Chappuis and the other Americans could not walk near a window or talk above a whisper.<ref name=Eck/><ref name=Specialist/> They passed the time playing cards with each other and with the Ugolini family with whom they stayed, and reading a well-worn copy of ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]''. The Americans were nearly captured one evening when the [[Italian fascism|Fascist]] fianc<U+00E9> of one of the Ugolini daughters entered the house unannounced and found the Americans playing cards. He threatened to turn the American in, but was persuaded not to when told it would mean the death of his fianc<U+00E9>e and her family for aiding the Americans.<ref name=Specialist/>   

When [[V-E Day]] arrived in early May 1945, Chappuis and his crewmates stayed in Asola for a week-long celebration. On the night the war ended, residents of Asola removed the seats from the town<U+2019>s theater for a victory ball. While two orchestras played onstage, the liberated townspeople toasted the Americans, and Chappuis danced with the Ugolinis' daughters.<ref name=Specialist/>  When Chappuis returned to the United States, he stayed in touch with the Ugolinis and sent them weekly food packages.<ref name=Specialist/> Chappuis also stayed in touch with Comucci, the resistance leader who rescued him. In 1974, Chappuis returned to Italy to meet with Comucci for the first time in 20 years.<ref name=Tosi/> And in August 1975, Comucci and his wife traveled to Michigan to visit Chappuis.<ref name=Tosi/>

==All-American at the University of Michigan==
===1946 season===
Chappuis returned to Michigan after being discharged from the military and played football in the spring of 1946. He returned in time to join the Michigan [[baseball]] team, where he played in the [[outfielder|outfield]], led the team in [[batting average|batting]], and helped them win the Big Nine championship with a 26-game winning streak.<ref>{{cite news|title=Michigan<U+2019>s Nine Win 26th Straight|publisher=The Wisconsin State Journal|date=1946-05-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Grayson, Harry|title=Fritz Crisler Predicts Greatest College Football Season|publisher=The Ogden Standard-Examiner|date=1946-08-19}}</ref>

When football season arrived in the fall, Chappuis was one of many veterans who returned to college and the [[Gridiron football|gridiron]] after serving in the war. Many of the returning veterans were not in prime football condition at the start of the 1946 season, and Coach [[Fritz Crisler]] <U+201C>predicted it might be November before ex-servicemen were adjusted physically and mentally to play their top game.<U+201D><ref name=Veterans>{{cite news|title=Military Veterans Find Grid Warfare Right Up Their Alley|publisher=Wisconsin Rapids Daily Tribune|date=1946-10-10}}</ref> Chappuis later recalled that he was 23 years old when he returned to school, and some of the returning veterans <U+201C>didn't know if they could get back into the rah-rah of college football, but Fritz took care of that. He really whipped us into shape.<U+201D><ref name=Tosi/>  Despite any difficulties in re-adjusting to civilian life and football, Chappuis had a tremendous football season in 1946. He broke [[Otto Graham]]'s [[Big Ten Conference|Big Nine Conference]] record for total offensive yards.<ref name=History>{{cite news|title=Bob Chappuis Out To Make Grid History At Michigan|publisher=Portland Press-Herald (Maine)|date=1947-10-21}}</ref> Though reports differ as to Chappuis' total yards gained, [[University of Michigan]] records show that Chappuis gained 1,284 yards in 1946 <U+2013> 734 yards passing, 501 yards rushing and 49 yards receiving.<ref name=Bentley/>  Chappuis set the new offensive mark in 1946 with a fractured bone in his [[wrist]] that he did not report until after the season had ended, at which time an operation was performed.<ref name=History/><ref name=Specialist/> Chappuis later said he knew the [[x-ray]] would reveal a fracture, and he would be benched before he even began.<ref name=Unspoiled/> He delayed the examination until the season was over because <U+201C>the time to break into the lineup is prior to the first game. If I hadn't, there were so many capable candidates around who could have made good behind our front wall that I'd never have become a first-stringer by returning in the middle of the season.<U+201D><ref name=Unspoiled/> Accordingly, Chappuis played the 1946 season with a fractured wrist and without even bothering to tape the wrist.<ref name=Unspoiled/> 

===1947 season===
[[Image:TheBigHouse.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Chappuis had a record-setting farewell to [[Michigan Stadium]].]]
Given the off-season wrist surgery, Chappuis was questionable for the 1947 season. As the season got underway, Chappuis said the wrist was <U+201C>not as loose<U+201D> as it was in 1946, but he felt it was "loose enough."<ref name=History/>  In the end, Chappuis broke his own Big Nine total offense record by gaining 1,405 yards as compared with 1,284 yards in 1946.<ref name=Bentley/><ref name=Eck>{{cite news|author=Eck, Frank|title=Midwest Places 3 in All-American Backfield: Lujack, Evans, Chappuis Chosen|publisher=Ironwood Daily Globe|date=1947-12-03}}</ref> He completed 48 out of 84 passes for 976 yards, including 11 touchdown passes. He also scored five touchdowns and gained 544 yards rushing.<ref name=Eck/>  In the season opener against [[Michigan State Spartans football|Michigan State]], Chappuis scored three touchdowns in a 55&ndash;0 victory, as Michigan outgained the Spartans 504 yards rushing to 56.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bob Chappuis Leads Wolves to 55-0 Win|publisher=Wisconsin State Journal|date=1947-09-28}}</ref>  Michigan finished the 1947 season with a 21&ndash;0 victory over [[Ohio State Buckeyes football|Ohio State]].  In his last game at [[Michigan Stadium]], Chappuis set a Michigan single-game record for total offense that would last 20 years. Altogether, Chappuis accounted for 307 yards, [[Rush (American football)|rushing]] for 90 yards and completing 12 of 27 passes for 217 yards.<ref>{{cite news|author=Kennesson, Frank|title=Big 9 Champion Wolves Win; Hoosiers Upset Purdue, 16&ndash;14: Bob Chappuis Gets 307 Yards in Win Over Ohio State|publisher=Associated Press|date=1947-11-23}}</ref>  At the end of the 1947 season, Chappuis was named a unanimous first-team [[College Football All-America Team|All-American]]. He also finished second to [[Johnny Lujack]] in the 1947 [[Heisman Trophy]] voting, with Lujack receiving 742 first and second place votes to 555 for Chappuis.<ref>{{cite news|title=Heisman Trophy Voting|publisher=Pacific Stars and Stripes|date=1991-12-18}}</ref> Despite the glowing adjectives heaped on him, reporters noted that <U+201C>Chappuis can still wear his regular size seven headgear.<U+201D> Chappuis gave credit to his line saying, <U+201C>Anyone passing behind the protection that line gave me could have done as well.<U+201D><ref name=Unspoiled>{{cite news|author=Bussey, Bev|title=Chappuis Unspoiled by All-America Honors, Praises Own Teammates|publisher=Long Beach Press-Telegram|date=1947-12-07}}</ref>

In addition to having the most accomplished season of his collegiate career, Chappuis was a leader on campus.<ref name=Look>{{cite news|title=1,000 Yard a Year Man|publisher=Look Magazine|date=1947-10-28}}</ref>  He was elected president of the Michigan Alpha chapter of the [[Phi Delta Theta]] fraternity whose membership included a number of his teammates and prominent University of Michigan athletic alumni such as [[Tom Harmon]], [[Bob Ufer]], and [[Harry G. Kipke]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Michigan Alpha Chapter Phi Delta Theta Fraternity Membership Directory|publisher=Stewart Howe Alumni Service|date=1998}}</ref>  Chappuis appeared on the cover of the [[October 28]], [[1947]] issue of [[Look (American magazine)|''Look'']] magazine which featured pictures of him on the football field and at the fraternity house.<ref name=Look/>

===Passing <U+201C>specialist<U+201D>===
Chappuis drew considerable attention in the national press for his abilities as a passer, one of the game's first passing <U+201C>specialists.<U+201D> In November 1947, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine ran a feature article about Chappuis and the 1947 Wolverines (with Chappuis' photograph on the cover) called <U+201C>The Specialist.<U+201D><ref name=Specialist>{{cite news|title=The Specialist|publisher=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=1947-11-03}}</ref> The ''Time'' article focused on the new era of specialization marked by coach [[Fritz Crisler]]'s decision to field separate offensive and defensive units in 1947. The article focused on Chappuis as Michigan's <U+201C>prize specialist,<U+201D> who was described as <U+201C>Crisler's triggerman.<U+201D><ref name=Specialist/> <U+201C>His job is to throw forward passes and there is no one in 1947 collegiate football who does it better.  . . . In Michigan's first five games, Specialist Chappuis was on the field less than one-third of the time, but of the 27 passes he threw, 19 were complete <U+2013> five of them for touchdowns. . . . When Chappuis fades back to pass, he is a slow-motion study in coolness and concentration.<U+201D><ref name=Specialist/>

Crisler said Chappuis was <U+201C>the finest passer I have ever handled and probably one of the best I've ever seen. He plays as though he had ice water in his veins.<U+201D><ref name=Eck/> Crisler felt that <U+201C>great passers are born,<U+201D><ref name=Eck/> and the difference between a great and a merely good passer is in the eyes. ''Time'' noted that Chappuis had the ability to spot his receivers tearing downfield and defenders rushing in to nail him <U+201C>in one panoramic glance.<U+201D><ref name=Specialist/> <U+201C>Like a good baseball catcher, he throws the ball off his right ear, with a snap motion. He throws what the coaches call a <U+2018>heavy ball.<U+2019><U+201D><ref name=Specialist/> Another writer noted that Chappuis was <U+201C>endowed with a passer's sixth sense, <U+2018>split vision,<U+2019><U+201D><ref name=Unspoiled/> and an ability to <U+201C>pick out his receiver after one glance over the field.<U+201D><ref name=Unspoiled/>

''Time'' also noted that Chappuis was unlike his predecessor, the <U+201C>hail-fellow<U+201D> [[Tom Harmon]]. <U+201C>His snaggleteeth and sharp features earned him the nickname <U+2018>Bird Face<U+2019> when he was a kid.<U+201D><ref name=Specialist/> ''Time'' also reported that Chappuis <U+201C>learns easily, just as he does in the classroom, where he makes a C-plus average seemingly without ever opening a book.<U+201D><ref name=Specialist/>

When Chappuis graduated, he held numerous school records, including most touchdown passes in a career with 23, a record that was not broken until 30 years later by four-year starter, [[Rick Leach]].<ref name=Tosi/><ref>{{cite news|title=Michigan drubs Iowa, Leach sets pass mark|publisher=Chronicle-Telegram, Elyria, Ohio|date=1977-10-30}}</ref> He also held the record for most touchdown passes in a season with 13, a record that was tied by Leach in 1976.<ref>{{cite news|title=Michigan Victory Sets Up Showdown|publisher=Galveston Daily News|date=1976-11-14}}</ref> He also held the school record for most career total offensive yards with 3,487, a record broken in 1970 by [[Don Moorhead]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Michigan Manhandles Iowa 55&ndash;0|publisher= Pacific Stars And Stripes|date=1970-11-16}}</ref>

===MVP of the 1948 Rose Bowl===
[[Image:Rose Bowl Stadium in Pasadena from Flickr 182952103.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Chappuis was named the 1948 [[Rose Bowl (game)|Rose Bowl]] MVP.]]
Chappuis played his last game for Michigan in a 49&ndash;0 win over the [[Southern California Trojans football|USC Trojans]] in the [[1948 Rose Bowl]] game. Chappuis ran for 91 yards, completed 14 of 24 passes for 188 yards, was named the Most Valuable Player, and set Rose Bowl records for total offense and pass completions.<ref name=Bentley/><ref>{{cite news|title=Michigan Swamps Trojans 49 to 0 in Rose Bowl Tilt|publisher=Oakland Tribune|date=1948-01-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Stiles, Maxwell|title=Michigan Rips Trojans Apart|publisher=Long Beach Press-Telegram|date=1948-01-02}}</ref> The ''Long Beach Independent'' reported: <U+201C>Bob Chappuis was every inch the All-American he has been tabbed. Running, faking and pivoting beautifully, he averaged 7 yards a crack for 13 carries and completed 14 out of 24 pitches for 188 yards . . . which gave him a new total offensive record of 278 yards for the classic.<U+201D><ref>{{cite news|title=Michigan Overpowers SC|publisher=Long Beach Independent|date=1948-01-02}}</ref>

==Professional football==
Chappuis was drafted by the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], and reports in February 1948 indicated that the Steelers had offered him a two-year contract for $20,000 per year.<ref>{{cite news|title=Chappuis to Play With Steelers|publisher=San Antonio Express|date=1948-02-28}}</ref> However, Chappuis passed up the Steelers offer, opting instead to play for the new [[All-America Football Conference]]. In June 1948, Chappuis signed with the [[Brooklyn Dodgers (AAFC)|Brooklyn Dodgers]] of the [[All-America Football Conference|AAFC]]. Chappuis had been drafted by the [[Cleveland Browns]], and the Dodgers gave the Browns three draft picks in exchange for the right to sign Chappuis.<ref>{{cite news|title=Brooklyn Grid Team Signs Bob Chappuis|publisher=Iowa City Press-Citizen|date=1948-06-28}}</ref> In his first professional game against the [[San Francisco 49ers]], Chappuis ran the ball 37 yards to the 49ers six-yard line in the fourth quarter, giving fans <U+201C>an indication of what sent all the major professional clubs after his services.<U+201D><ref>{{cite news|author=Willis, Wally|title=49ers Trounce Brooklyn, 36-20|publisher=Oakland Tribune|date=1948-09-06}}</ref>  Chappuis played in 13 games for the Dodgers in 1946 and led the team in total offense.<ref>{{cite web|title=1948 Brooklyn Dodgers|url=http://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/bda/1948.htm}}</ref> He completed 100 of 213 passes for 1,402 yards with 15 interceptions and eight touchdown passes. He also rushed for 310 yards, for an average of 6.0 yards per carry, and one rushing touchdown.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bob Chappuis|url=http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/C/ChapBo20.htm|publisher=pro-football-reference.com}}</ref> Unfortunately for Chappuis, the Dodgers finished the season with a 2&ndash;12 record and folded after the 1948 season.  In 1949, Chappuis played for the [[Chicago Hornets]], also of the AAFC, but saw only limited playing time as a back-up to [[Bob Hoernschemeyer]].<ref name=Quit>{{cite news|title=Chappuis to Quit Pro Grid Ranks|publisher=European Stars And Stripes|date=1950-06-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=1949 Chicago Hornets|url=http://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/cra/1949.htm}}</ref> When the AAFC went out of existence after the 1949 season, Chappuis retired from football.<ref name=Whatever>{{cite news|title=Whatever Happened To . . . Bob Chappuis|publisher=Leader-Times, Kittanning, Penn.|date=1958-06-06}}</ref> In announcing his retirement in June 1950, Chappuis said he was through with professional football and that his ambition then was <U+201C>to play [[golf]] with the boys on weekends, eat with the [[Rotary Club]] on Thursdays, and live in some town close enough to [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]] for those fall football games.<U+201D><ref name=Quit/>

==Business career==
After retiring from football, Chappuis worked in various business ventures. In the 1950s, he was in the electrical appliance business in [[South Bend, Indiana]].<ref name=Whatever/> He spent thirteen years with Central Soya Co. in [[Fort Wayne, Indiana]], retiring in 1983 as the Vice President in charge of Labor Relations.<ref name=Tosi/><ref name=CFHOF>{{cite web|title=College Football Hall of Fame: Bob Chappuis|url=http://www.collegefootball.org/famersearch.php?id=40075 |publisher=College Football Hall of Fame}}</ref> He later formed his own management consulting business in Fort Wayne.<ref>{{cite news|title=11 Named to College Football Hall of Fame|publisher=Pacific Stars and Stripes|date=1988-01-25}}</ref>

==Family==
Chappuis and his wife, Ann Chappuis, had four children.<ref name=Tosi/> Chappuis is also the uncle of former [[Michigan Wolverines football|Michigan]] and [[Indianapolis Colts|Baltimore Colts]] strong safety [[Rick Volk]].
