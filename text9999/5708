Most sources of renewable energy are new to Russia and have experienced development in recent years. However, hydroelectric power has a long history in Russia, dating back to the Soviet era. The rapid expansion of hydroelectric power in the Soviet Union began in 1930, when the total installed capacity equaled 600,000&nbsp;kWh. The Soviet Union built its first windmill in 1941, which had a capacity of 100&nbsp;kW.<ref name="Energy_Congress">{{cite web|title=Renewables: The Energy for the 21st Century| publisher = World Renewable Energy Congress VI| date = 1<U+2013>7 July 2000 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=tl30wipZ-SoC&pg=PA2560&dq#v=onepage&q&f=false| accessdate = 25 February 2011}}</ref> By the time the Soviet Union collapsed in 1990, it had a total installed capacity of {{nowrap|65 million kWh}}.

Overall, [[Energy policy of the Soviet Union|Soviet energy policy]] focused on nuclear and thermal power, although renewable energy was not completely neglected. The [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] prevented those goals from being fulfilled.<ref name="Soviet_Energy_Goals">{{cite web|title=Soviet Union- Energy Planning Goals| publisher = country-data.com| date = May 1989 | url = http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-12738.html| accessdate = 30 January 2011}}</ref>

The construction of the large dams prominent in Soviet times largely ended in the 1990s with the creation of the Russian Federation. In addition, due to the post-Soviet recession, much of the country's infrastructure, including dams, fell into disrepair.<ref name="RusHydro" /><ref name="Soviet_Infrastructure">{{cite web|author=Andrew Kramer|title=Decaying Soviet Infrastructure Shows Its Era| publisher = The New York Times| date = 20 August 2009 | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/21/business/global/21ruble.html| accessdate = 30 January 2011}}</ref> Use of oil and gas for energy took priority in Russia and renewable energy was ignored.

== Hydropower ==
[[File:Pavodok, Zhigulevskaya GES.JPG|240px|thumb|left|alt=refer to caption|[[Zhiguli Hydroelectric Station]] during a [[freshet]]]]
Hydropower is the most used form of renewable energy in Russia, and there is large potential in Russia for more use of hydropower. Russia has 102 hydropower plants with capacities of over 100&nbsp;MW, making it fifth in the world for hydropower production. It is also second in the world for hydro potential, yet only 20% of this potential is developed.<ref name="RusHydro" /> Russia is home to 9% of the world's hydro resources ,<ref name="EBRD" /> mostly in Siberia and the country's far east. At the end of 2005, the generating capacity from [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] sources in Russia was 45,700&nbsp;MW, and an additional 5,648&nbsp;MW was under construction. Russia has much potential for using its hydro resources, with a theoretical potential of about 2,295&nbsp;TWh/yr, with 852&nbsp;TWh being economically feasible.<ref name="Energy_survey" />

The largest dams in Russia are the [[Sayano-Shushenskaya Dam]], which has an installed capacity of 6,400&nbsp;MW; the [[Krasnoyarsk Dam]] (6,000&nbsp;MW); the [[Bratsk Hydroelectric Power Station|Bratsk Dam]] (4,500&nbsp;MW); the [[Ust-Ilimsk Hydroelectric Power Station|Ust-Ilimsk Dam]] (4,320&nbsp;MW) and the [[Zeya Dam]] (1,330&nbsp;MW).<ref name="RusHydro" /> Some of the most recent dam projects are the [[Bureya Dam]] (2010&nbsp;MW) and the [[Irganai Dam]] (800&nbsp;MW). The [[Boguchany Dam]] (1920&nbsp;MW), Zelenchuk Dam (320&nbsp;MW), Zaramag Dam (352&nbsp;MW) and Nizhne-Chereksky (60&nbsp;MW) are currently under construction.<ref name="Energy_survey" /> [[RusHydro]] is the largest hydroelectric company in Russia and the second largest hydroelectric producer in the world.<ref name="RusHydro_Reuters">{{cite web|title=Russia appoints Sechin ally to manage hydro giant| publisher = Reuters| date = 23 November 2009 | url = http://uk.reuters.com/article/2009/11/23/rushydro-dod-idUKGEE5AM0RW20091123?sp=true| accessdate = 30 January 2011}}</ref> In October 2010, [[China Yangtze Power]], the largest hydropower corporation in China, and [[EuroSibEnergo]], a Russian energy company, signed a cooperation agreement to expand hydroelectric energy production in Russia and export energy to China's northern territories.<ref name="China_Hydro">{{cite web|title=Russia's EuroSibEnergo signs deal with China's hydro power corporation| publisher = RIA Novosti| date = 2 December 2010 | url = http://www.bsr-russia.com/en/power-a-utilities/item/1307-russias-eurosibenergo-signs-deal-with-chinas-hydro-power-corporation.html| accessdate = 26 February 2011}}</ref> The [[West Siberian Generating Company]] has plans to start construction of eight mini-hydroelectric power plants in the Altai region before 2015.<ref name="West_Siberian">{{cite web|title=West Siberian genco to build 8 hydro-electric plants in Altai| publisher = RIA Novosti| date = 15 December 2010 | url = http://en.rian.ru/russia/20101215/161783545.html| accessdate = 26 February 2011}}</ref>

== Geothermal energy ==
{{main|Geothermal power in Russia}}
Geothermal energy is the second most used form of renewable energy in Russia but represents less than 1% of the total energy production. The first geothermal power plant in Russia was built at Pauzhetka, [[Kamchatka_Peninsula|Kamchatka]], in 1966, with a capacity of 5&nbsp;MW. The total geothermal installed capacity in 2005 was 79&nbsp;MW, with 50&nbsp;MW coming from a plant at Verkhne-Mutnovsky. Russia is currently developing a 100&nbsp;MW plant at Mutnovsky and a 50&nbsp;MW plant in [[Kaliningrad]].<ref name="Energy_survey" /> Most geothermal resources are currently used for heating settlements in the [[North Caucasus]] and [[Kamchatka Peninsula|Kamchatka]].

Russia has a long history of small-scale wind energy use but has never developed large-scale commercial wind energy production. Most of its current wind production is located in agricultural areas with low population densities where connection to the main energy grid is difficult. Russia is estimated to have a total potential of 80,000 TWh/yr for wind energy, 6,218&nbsp;TWh/yr of which is economically feasible.<ref name="Energy_survey" /> Most of this potential is found in the southern steppes and the seacoasts of Russia, although in many of these areas the population density is less than {{nowrap|1 person per square km}}. This low population density means that there is little existing electricity infrastructure currently in place, which hinders development of these resources.<ref name="Energy_Congress" />  In 2006, Russia had a total installed wind capacity of 15&nbsp;MW.<ref name="RIAN2">{{cite web|title=Russia to spend $200 million on largest wind-power plant| publisher = RIA Novosti| date = 30 July 2010 | url = http://en.rian.ru/russia/20100730/160006679.html| accessdate = 23 January 2011}}</ref> Current Russian wind energy projects have a combined capacity of over 1,700&nbsp;MW.

Russia is one of the largest grain producers, has a well-developed [[ethanol|ethyl alcohol]] industry and has increasing [[Brassica napus|rapeseed]] (often used to create [[biodiesel]]) production rates.<ref name="APEC_Biofuel">{{cite web|title=Russia Biofuels Activities| publisher = Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation| year = 2008 | url = http://www.biofuels.apec.org/me_russia.html| accessdate = 28 January 2011}}</ref> The Russian government declared in 2008 that it would play an active role in developing the biofuel industry by building 30 new biofuel plants and providing tax breaks and subsidized interest rates to biofuel energy projects.<ref name="Modern_Russia">{{cite web|title=Russia's biofuel energy revolution| publisher = Modern Russia| date = 22 November 2010 | url = http://www.modernrussia.com/content/russia%E2%80%99s-biofuel-energy-revolution| accessdate = 28 January 2011}}</ref> Although these plans were delayed, on 13 September 2010, Medvedev announced that construction would begin in early 2011.<ref name="Geographical_Society">{{cite web|title=First Biofuel Plant to be built in Russia| publisher = Russian Geographical Society| date = 19 October 2010 | url = http://int.rgo.ru/news/first-biofuel-plant-to-be-built-in-russia/| accessdate = 28 January 2011}}</ref> [[Butanol fuel|Biobutanol]], the biofuel produced by these plants, would be produced from [[lumber|timber]] by-products, such as [[woodchips]] and [[sawdust]].<ref name="APEC_Biofuel" /><ref name="Modern_Russia" /><ref name="Gazeta_Biofuel">{{cite web|title=Russia's first biofuel plant| publisher = Rossiyskaya Gazeta| date = 6 October 2010 | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sponsored/russianow/business/8045849/Russias-first-biofuel-plant.html| accessdate = 28 January 2011}}</ref>

==Biomass==
[[Biomass]] is already used in some parts of Russia to provide a total of 1%, or 9&nbsp;Twh/year, of Russia's total energy. However, due to Russia's vast forest and [[peat]] reserves,<ref group=nb>[[Peat]] is not universally recognized as [[renewable resource|renewable]] [[biomass]] resource, due to its long regeneration period.</ref> it has a total biomass technical potential of 431&nbsp;Twh/year, of which 285&nbsp;Twh/year is economically feasible.<ref name="IEA_Biomass">{{cite web|author=Elena Douraeva|title=Opportunities for Renewable Energy in Russia| publisher = International Energy Agency| year=2003 | url = http://www.iea.org/speech/2006/emb_renew.pdf| accessdate = 29 January 2011}}</ref><ref name="FFRI_Wood">{{cite web|author=Timo Karjalainen, Yuri Gerasimov|title=Energy Wood Potential in Northwest Russia| publisher = Finnish Forest Research Institute| date = September 2008 | url = http://www.biomassenergycentre.org.uk/pls/portal/docs/PAGE/RESOURCES/REF_LIB_RES/PUBLICATIONS/IEA_CONFERENCE/TIMO%20KARJALAINEN.PDF| accessdate = 29 January 2011}}</ref> Most of this potential is found in northwestern Russia, which has a developed [[Pulp (paper)|pulp]] and [[paper]] industry that can provide wood-based waste to use as biomass energy.<ref name="Our_Planet">{{cite web|author=Elena Merle-Beral|title=Waking the Giant| publisher = Our Planet | url = http://www.unep.org/ourplanet/imgversn/164/Elena%20Merle-Beral.pdf| accessdate = 29 January 2011}}</ref> 

Use of peat for energy production was prominent during the Soviet Union, with the peak occurring in 1965 and declining from that point. In 1929, over 40% of the Soviet Union's electric energy came from peat, which dropped to 1% by 1980. Currently, Russia is responsible for 17% of the world's peat production, and 20% of the peat that it produces, {{nowrap|1.5 million tons}}, is used for energy purposes.<ref name=Energy_survey/><ref name="RGS_Peat">{{cite web|title=Peat: Useful Resource or Hazard?| publisher = Russian Geographical Society| date=10 August 2010 | url = http://int.rgo.ru/news/peat-useful-resource-or-hazard/| accessdate = 29 January 2011}}</ref> [[Shatura Power Station]] in [[Moscow Oblast]] and Kirov Power Station in [[Kirov Oblast]] are the two [[List of peat power stations|largest peat power stations]] in the world.<ref>{{cite web|title=Shatura Power Station|publisher=The Fourth Generation Company of the Wholesale Electricity Market|year=2007|url=http://eng.ogk-4.ru/?obj=about1|accessdate=31 January 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Russia's peat generation|publisher=The Milwaukee Journal|date=20 March 1959|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=LlsaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=aiYEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3107%2C5220455|accessdate=31 January 2011}}</ref>
