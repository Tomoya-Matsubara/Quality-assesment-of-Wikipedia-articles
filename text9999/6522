{{distinguish|West Lancashire Light Railway}}

The '''West Lancashire Railway''' (WLR) ran northeast from [[Southport]] to [[Preston]] in northwest England.

==History==

Construction was started by Samuel Swire the [[Mayor]] of Southport, on 19 April 1873. 
A branch was constructed from Penwortham to the Blackburn line at Whitehouse Junction allowing direct services from [[East Lancashire Railway 1844-1859|East Lancashire Railway]] to Southport. 

In 1881 a further branch was constructed from east of Hesketh Bank station southwards to [[Tarleton]] [[Canal lock|Lock]] on the Rufford Branch of the [[Leeds and Liverpool Canal]] by the [[River Douglas]]. This was mainly intended for goods, but a passenger service did run on the branch until 1912/3. The branch closed completely in 1930.

==Expansion, backruptcy and take over==

It also sponsored the [[Liverpool, Southport and Preston Junction Railway]], opened in 1887 to provide greater access to Liverpool (in competition with its rival the [[Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway]]) and in an attempt to forge a commercial alliance with the [[Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway]].  At one time the line featured as a potential alternative route to [[Blackpool]].  The line was never successful and its construction [[bankrupt|bankrupted]] the West Lancashire Railway.  Finally in 1897 the two railways were taken over by their competitor, the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway.

Up to the take over, the WLR used its own stations at each terminus.  These were [[Southport Central railway station|Central station]] in Southport and [[Preston Fishergate Hill railway station|Fishergate Hill]] in Preston.  The new owners built a west-to-north connecting chord at Whitehouse Junction which enabled them to redirect all of the WLR passenger trains into their own [[Preston Railway Station|Preston (ELR) Station]]. Likewise at the Southport end, passenger trains were rerouted into the adjacent [[Southport railway station|Chapel Street Station]].  Both WLR termini became goods dep<U+00F4>ts with that at Preston seeing occasional passenger use when it played host to special services during the [[Preston Guild]].

==Electrification==

From 22 March 1904 the line from {{stnlnk|Crossens}} to Southport was electrified using a [[third rail]] to provide an electric service all the way to Liverpool. From 15 February 1909, electrification was extended to {{stnlnk|Meols Cop}}; most electric trains between Southport and Crossens called at Meols Cop and reversed out.<ref>Cotterall, pp.31&ndash;32</ref>

==Closure==

Passenger services, including the electric ones, ceased in 1964 and most of the line was closed.  A goods service to Hesketh Park continued until November 1967.
