==History and Ownership==
Its ownership lies in the hands of [[Kalanidhi Maran]] who is related to [[Karunanidhi]], [[Chief Minister]] of [[Tamil Nadu]] and head of [[Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]] (DMK). In fact the logo of Sun TV was inspired by the "Rising Sun" which is the party symbol of DMK. The headquarters too is in the premises of ''Anna Arivalayam'' the HQ of DMK in [[Chennai]].

It was the first fully privately owned Tamil channel in India when it emerged in 1992.

On [[November 7]], [[2005]], DMK president M Karunanidhi announced that his wife Dayalu Ammal has relinquished her 20% shares in Sun Network and its Tamil publications [http://dnaindia.com/report.asp?NewsID=8839]. This arrangement was on the cards for many months. The move by Karunanidhi<U+2019>s family to divest from the Rs 600-crore Sun TV Group comes in the wake of speculation that the 85-year-old DMK patriarch is quite piqued with the channel<U+2019>s managers for virtually blacking out his son, MK Stalin, the DMK<U+2019>s deputy general secretary, who is being groomed to take over the DMK reins.
