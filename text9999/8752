'''The Australian National University''', or '''ANU''', is a [[Public university|public]] [[university]] located in [[Canberra]], the national capital of [[Australia]]. Founded in 1946 by the Australian Government as Australia's only research-only university, ANU was created with a mandate for "postgraduate research and study, both generally and in relation to subjects of national importance to Australia" and was intended to strengthen Australia's research efforts at the highest levels. 
In 1960 [[undergraduate]] education was added to the ANU by amalgamation with the [[Canberra University College]]. ANU is the only university in Australia with a constitution and structure dictated by an Act of the Commonwealth Parliament; all other Australian universities were established by State or Territory parliaments. The University is governed by a 15 member Council.

ANU is regarded as [[Australia]]'s (and the [[Southern Hemisphere]]'s) leading University, and has been [[College and university rankings|ranked]] as such by various independent sources. ANU was ranked 16th in the world and first in the Southern Hemisphere by ''[[The Times Higher Education Supplement]]'' in 2004 <ref name="Rankings1">[http://www.paked.net/higher_education/rankings/times_rankings_2004.htm The Times Higher Education Supplement World Rankings 2004]</ref>, whilst in 2005<ref name="Rankings2">[http://www.alnaja7.org/success/Education/times_world_ranking_2005.pdf The Times Higher Education Supplement World Rankings 2005]</ref> it slipped to 23rd (second in the Southern Hemisphere) before again being placed as 16th in the world (first in the Southern Hemisphere) in 2006. Also in 2006, ''[[Newsweek]]''<ref name="Rankings5">[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14321230/site/newsweek/ Newsweek Top 100 Global Universities]</ref> named ANU 38th in the world in its Top 100 Global Universities List (again, the top ranked university in Australia). 

ANU is particularly strong in research, and is a member of Australia's [[Group of Eight (Australian Universities)|Group of Eight]], the [[Association of Pacific Rim Universities]], the [[Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy]] and the exclusive [[International Alliance of Research Universities]].

==History==
[[Image:ANU.jpg|thumb|275px|left|Students eat lunch at ANU]]
The ANU was built around and by a group of Australian scholars who had already achieved international distinction, including a leader in radar development and nuclear physics, Sir Mark Oliphant; the discoverer of the benefits of penicillin, Sir Howard Florey; eminent historian, Sir Keith Hancock; and renowned economist and public servant, Herbert <U+2018>Nugget<U+2019> Coombs.

A new generation of Australian researchers rapidly earned a reputation for excellence for their work done at ANU. The University also broadened its research base and introduced new disciplines as it pursued a vigorous expansion program.

In 1960, ANU began offering undergraduate degrees, beginning another era of national leadership <U+2014> this time based on excellent teaching.

The University<U+2019>s reputation as a centre of excellence in both teaching and research was progressively built by a range of academic leaders. Professor Manning Clark made his mark as an eminent historian; Professor Bart Bok moved from Harvard to lead astronomy at ANU; and the University<U+2019>s first female professor, Hanna Neumann, was a significant mathematician and scholar as well as an important role model for female scientists.

The University today is characterised by quality <U+2014> supported by a unique concentration of effort in the fundamental disciplines <U+2014> the national recruitment of students, accessible infrastructure and important cross-disciplinary collaborative links between scholars.

With approximately three per cent of the total academic staff in Australia, the ANU continues to perform well, and in many areas outperforms other, larger universities. For example, a ranking of researchers who have made fundamental contributions to their discipline in the last 20 years, ISIHighlyCited, identifies 21 ANU researchers within the 50 Australians named at the top of their field. The ANU has far more Fellows of the Royal Society of London than any other Australian university and many of its research staff and teaching programs have been ranked among the world<U+2019>s best.

ANU graduates hold top positions in government, business and academic fields, both locally and abroad.

On the evening of the 27th of February 2007, much of the ANU was damaged during a [[Supercell]] storm. This left up to sixty buildings damaged, including the JB Chifley Building, housing the main library, along with many more.

==Academic structure==
The academic structure of the ANU is made up of three parts: The Institute of Advanced Studies, The Faculties and the University Centres.

===The Institute of Advanced Studies===
The Institute is focused on post-graduate education and research and comprises nine research schools and a research centre:
*'''Research School of Astronomy and Astrophysics'''
:Australia's premier university center for astronomical research, the Research School of Astronomy and Astrophysics (RSAA) is based at the [[Mount Stromlo Observatory]]. RSAA runs ANU's telescopes at the [[Siding Spring Observatory]], in [[New South Wales|NSW]]. On Thursday [[20 April]], [[2006]] it was reported that the Research School of Astronomy and Astrophysics would build the world's most powerful telescope<ref name="Telescope">[http://canberra.yourguide.com.au/detail.asp?class=news&subclass=local&story_id=474496&category=general%20news&m=4&y=2006 ""ANU part of elite group to build world's biggest telescope"" The Canberra Times ]</ref>.  This project is a collaboration between an elite international group of research institutions which also includes the [[University of Arizona]], [[Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory]] and [[Harvard University]].

The ANU's main campus is located in, and occupies most of the [[Canberra]] suburb of [[Acton, Australian Capital Territory|Acton]].  The campus covers 1.45 km<U+00B2> (350 acres) adjoining native bushland, [[Black Mountain (Australian Capital Territory)|Black Mountain]], [[Lake Burley Griffin]], the suburb of [[Turner, Australian Capital Territory|Turner]] and the [[City Centre, Australian Capital Territory|city centre]]. Eight of the university's nine affiliated halls and colleges are located on campus, while Fenner Hall is located on Northbourne Avenue in the nearby suburb of [[Braddon, Australian Capital Territory|Braddon]]. The halls and colleges are:
 
*[[Bruce Hall]],
*[[Ursula Hall]],
*[[Fenner Hall]],
*[[Burgmann College]],

With over 10,000 trees on its "green" campus, the ANU was awarded the Silver Greenhouse Challenge Award at the annual Australian Engineering Excellence Awards in 2003.

The Research School of Astronomy and Astrophysics (RSAA) is located away from the main campus in Acton, at the [[Mount Stromlo Observatory]], near [[Weston Creek]] in south [[Canberra]]. RSAA also runs the [[Siding Spring Observatory]] near [[Coonabarabran]], [[New South Wales]]. Since the destruction of Mount Stromlo's telescopes in the [[Canberra bushfires]] of 2003, this is ANU's only telescope site. The university also runs a coastal campus at [[Kioloa Coastal Campus|Kioloa]] on the [[South Coast, New South Wales|South Coast]] of [[New South Wales]] dedicated to field work training, and a North Australia Research Unit in [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]] in the [[Northern Territory]].

Students on all campuses are represented by the ANU Students' Association. Representation for postgraduate students is provided by the Postgraduate and Research Students' Association (PARSA), a member of the [[Council of Australian Postgraduate Associations]].
