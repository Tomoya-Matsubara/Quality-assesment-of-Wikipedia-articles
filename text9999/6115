The '''Spirit Squad''' was a [[professional wrestling]] [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Stable|stable]] in [[World Wrestling Entertainment]] (WWE) and [[Ohio Valley Wrestling]] (OVW) that consisted of [[Kenny Dykstra|Kenny]], [[Johnny Jeter|Johnny]], [[Nick Mitchell|Mitch]], [[Dolph Ziggler|Nicky]], and [[Michael Brendli|Mikey]]. The team's [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Gimmick|ring personas]] were those of an all-male [[cheerleading]] squad.

Before forming the group, all members competed in OVW, WWE's [[Farm team#Professional wrestling|developmental territory]], where they were once opponents. In January 2006, the Spirit Squad made their television debut on the [[WWE Raw|Raw]] [[WWE Brand Extension|brand]]. Three months later, the team would go on to win the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|World Tag Team Championship]] and, by "executive decision", were all collectively recognized as champions and internally decided which two defended the belts at any given time. Their reign marked the first time five wrestlers had been simultaneously recognized as World Tag Team Champions.

After losing the tag team championship in November 2006, the team disbanded, with Kenny the only member to appear on WWE television. Nicky, Mikey and Johnny returned to OVW, where Mikey and Nicky formed a tag team, and Mitch was released from his WWE contract in May 2007. Today, only Nicky still remains under a WWE contract, where he performs under the name "Dolph Ziggler."

== History ==
=== Formation ===
The group made their first appearances in [[World Wrestling Entertainment]] (WWE) at [[house show]]s and in [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Dark match|dark matches]].<ref name="obsessed">{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/s/spirit-squad.html|title=The Spirit Squad|accessdate=2007-12-26|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref> On January 23, 2006, they had their television debut, when they appeared on ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]'' and helped [[Jonathan Coachman]] win a [[Royal Rumble (2006)|Royal Rumble]] qualifying match against [[Jerry Lawler|Jerry "The King" Lawler]] by performing cheers for Coachman and distracting Lawler.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/archive/01232006/|title=Ready to Rumble|date=2006-01-23|accessdate=2007-12-26|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]}}</ref> In subsequent weeks, the team was hired by several wrestlers to perform cheers for them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/archive/01302006/|title=Wasted opportunity?|date=2006-01-30|accessdate=2008-01-16|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]|quote=Mickie brought out the Spirit Squad to give Trish a cheer.}}</ref>

They eventually became a part of the on-going [[Feud (professional wrestling)|scripted feud]] between WWE chairman [[Vince McMahon]] and [[Shawn Michaels]]. The [[Heel (professional wrestling)|villainous]] McMahon ordered the Squad to perform disrespectful cheers about Michaels, attack him on numerous occasions, and face him in multiple [[Professional wrestling match types#Handicap match|handicap matches]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/archive/02202006/|title="Big Time" Pedigree|date=2006-02-20|accessdate=2008-01-16|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/archive/03132006/|title=Sneak Attack|date=2006-03-13|accessdate=2008-01-16|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]}}</ref>

While involved in the Michaels-McMahon feud, they also continued wrestling in the tag team division, and on the April 3, 2006 episode of ''Raw'', won the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|World Tag Team Championship]] when Kenny and Mikey <U+2013> with outside help from the other three Squad members <U+2013> defeated [[Big Show and Kane]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/archive/04032006/|title=The Champ bows down to the <U+201C>King of Kings<U+201D>|date=2006-04-03|accessdate=2008-01-05|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]}}</ref><ref name="title history">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/worldtagteam/2448432|title=Spirit Squad|date=2006-04-03|accessdate=2008-01-05|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]}}</ref> After winning the championship, an "executive edict" was declared stating that all five members were recognized as the champions, with any two members allowed to defend the championship at once under the [[The Fabulous Freebirds#Freebird Rule|Freebird Rule]].

On May 1, the night after the [[Backlash (2006)|Backlash]] [[pay-per-view]], the five members of the Spirit Squad were jointly named "[[Professional wrestling authority figures#General Managers|Co-General Managers]]" of ''Raw''.<ref name="gm">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/archive/05012006/|title=Chaos in Columbus|date=2006-05-01|first=Ed|last=Williams III|accessdate=2007-12-30|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]}}</ref> During the night, after drawing "spirit straws", they placed Kenny into a title match with [[WWE Championship|WWE Champion]] [[John Cena]].<ref name="gm"/> Before the match they ordered play-by-play analyst [[Joey Styles]] in their office to instruct him on how to call Kenny's upcoming win (which never did come to pass), instructing him to do it "with spirit" or they would force him to call all of the following ''Raw'' episodes while wearing a (female) cheerleading uniform.<ref name="gm"/> This led to Styles confronting color-commentator Jerry Lawler and eventually quitting the show (and WWE) in a [[Shoot (professional wrestling)|worked shoot]] [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Promo|promo]].<ref name="gm"/> Kenny lost the match after [[Referee (professional wrestling)#Special referees|special referee]] [[Triple H]], who was conspiring with the Squad, walked out on the match.<ref name="gm"/>

Three weeks later, on ''Raw'', Vince McMahon signed another handicap match pitting the Spirit Squad against Shawn Michaels.<ref name="May 22, 2006">{{cite news|url=http://www.wrestleview.com/results/raw/raw2006/1148355103.shtml|title=Raw Results 5-22-06: Las Vegas, NV (Triple H Turns, ECW, and more!)|last=Golden|first=Hunter|date=2006-05-22|publisher=WrestleView|accessdate=2010-01-06}}</ref><ref name="knee">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/archive/05222006/|title=Apology Accepted?|date=2006-05-22|last=Dee|first=Louie|accessdate=2008-01-16|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]}}</ref> The match never started, however, because the Spirit Squad attacked Michaels, ripping apart his ring attire and, in [[kayfabe|storyline]], shattering his knee with a [[Folding chair|steel chair]].<ref name="knee"/> McMahon then called Triple H to the ring to attack Michaels with a [[sledgehammer]], however, Kenny snatched the sledgehammer away, disrespecting Triple H, which led to him attacking the group.<ref name="knee"/>

At the same time as their feud with DX and their alignment with McMahon, the team also wrestled other teams in Raw's tag team division over their World Tag Team Championship.

=== Breakup and aftermath ===
The group disbanded on the November 27 episode of ''Raw'', when they were defeated in a five-on-three handicap match by DX and Flair.<ref name="loss"/> In a backstage segment later that night, DX placed all members into a crate stamped "OVW, [[Louisville, Kentucky]]", a reference to the developmental territory from which the Spirit Squad had come.<ref name="loss">{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2006/11/28/2530992.html|title=Raw: The return of the Hardys|date=2006-11-28|last=Plummer|first=Dale|accessdate=2010-01-06|work=Slam!
