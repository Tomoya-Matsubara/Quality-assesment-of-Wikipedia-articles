'''''Even Worse''''' is the fifth [[studio album]] by [["Weird Al" Yankovic]], released in 1988. The album was the fifth produced by former [[The McCoys]] guitarist [[Rick Derringer]]. Recorded between November 1987 and February 1988, this album helped to revitalize Yankovic's career after the critical and commercial disappointment of his previous album ''[[Polka Party!]]'' (1986).

The music on ''Even Worse'' is built around parodies and pastiches of [[pop music|pop]] and [[rock music]] of the mid 1980s. Half of the album is made up of parodies, featuring jabs at [[Michael Jackson]], [[George Harrison]], [[Tiffany (singer)|Tiffany]], the folk song "[[La Bamba]]," and [[Billy Idol]]. The other half of the album is original material, featuring many "style parodies," or musical imitations that come close to, but do not copy, existing artists. These style parodies include imitations of specific artists like [[Oingo Boingo]], [[Beastie Boys]], and [[James Taylor]]. ''Even Worse'' has the distinction of being one of two albums by "Weird Al" Yankovic lacking any polka renditions of pop songs or medleys, the other being his debut album ''[["Weird Al" Yankovic (album)|"Weird Al" Yankovic]]'' (1983), released five years earlier. This album's title and cover art of the album is a spoof on that of Michael Jackson's 1987 album, ''[[Bad (album)|Bad]]''.

''Even Worse'' was met with mostly positive reviews and peaked at number twenty-seven on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], becoming Yankovic's best selling album. The album also  produced one of Yankovic's hit singles, "[[Fat (song)|Fat]]," a parody of Michael Jackson's "[[Bad (song)|Bad]]," which peaked at number ninety-nine on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and became a staple of MTV. The album was quickly certified as a [[gold record]], and later as a [[platinum record]] with sales of over one million copies in the United States, becoming Yankovic's first platinum record. "Fat" was later nominated and won a [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Concept Music Video|Best Concept Music Video]] at the [[Grammy Awards of 1989|1989 Grammy Awards]].

==Production==
===Background and recording===
After success in the early 80s, comedy artist "Weird Al" Yankovic released ''[[Polka Party!]]'' in 1986. Despite featuring parodies of hit songs like "Living in America" and "Addicted to Love" the album was a critical and commercial failure, not producing a charting single and only managing to peak at number 177 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. After the disappointment with ''Polka Party!'' Yankovic went on record saying, "I thought it was the end of my career."<ref name="praitb">{{cite album-notes| title= Permanent Record: Al in the Box| albumlink= Permanent Record: Al in the Box| bandname= [["Weird Al" Yankovic]]| year        = 1994| url= http://dmdb.org/al/booklet.html| first = Barret| last = Hansen| authorlink  = Dr. Demento| format= liner| publisher = [[Scotti Brothers Records]]| location = [[California]], [[United States|USA]] | mbid = 33c42e29-bcad-45eb-8fce-f178e4f0bf32}}</ref> For most of 1987, Yankovic took a short recording break.<ref name="allmusic">{{Cite web| last = Chadbourne  | first = Eugene  | title = Polka Party! - Weird Al Yankovic  | publisher = allmusic.com  | url = http://www.allmusic.com/album/r82656/review  | accessdate = 21 April 2011}}</ref>

In November 1987, Yankovic returned to the studio to craft his follow-up to ''Polka Party!'' Once again, former [[The McCoys]] guitarist [[Rick Derringer]] was brought in to produce the album. During the first session, two songs were recorded, "Stuck In A Closet With Vanna White," and "Melanie."<ref name="recordingdates"/> The next month, three songs were recorded, "Good Old Days," "You Make Me," and "Velvet Elvis."<ref name="recordingdates">{{Cite web| url = http://www.weirdal.com/rcdgdate.htm | title = Recording Dates | accessdate = 2010-06-26 | last = Yankovic | first = Alfred M. | authorlink = "Weird Al" Yankovic | year = 2007 | month = December | work = The Official "Weird Al" Yankovic Web Site}}</ref> Finally, in the early winter of 1988, the remaining songs were recorded.<ref name="recordingdates"/>

===Originals===
One of the first original songs recorded for the album was "Stuck in a Closet With Vanna White" about a man describing his bizarre recurring dream about [[Vanna White]]. [[Allmusic]] described the song as a "real winner for Yankovic" because it "was the first song [Yankovic] wrote that his [...] target audience [...] actually liked as much or even more than his parodies."<ref name="AMG"/> "You Make Me" is a song involving a person's desire to engage in strange and/or violent behavior compelled by the weirdness of another person. According to the liner notes of ''The Permanent Record'', "It's about as close as [Yankovic has] ever come to writing a real love song."<ref name="praitb"/> Musically, the song is a style parody of [[Oingo Boingo]].<ref name="praitb">{{cite album-notes

However, when it came time to pick the right take, he opted for the first because it sounded "more raw and more off-the-cuff."<ref name="Set List"/> The album's closer, "Good Old Days" is about a psychopath fondly remembering his childhood.

===Parodies===
The first [[parody]] recorded for ''Even Worse'' was "I Think I'm a Clone Now." The song, a spoof of "[[I Think We're Alone Now]]" as [[cover song|covered]] by [[Tiffany (singer)|Tiffany]],<ref name="parodies"/> is the story of a man who details his life as a clone of another person. The second parody recorded was "Alimony," a parody of "[[Mony Mony]]" as covered by [[Billy Idol]].<ref name="parodies"/> The song is a diatribe about the narrator's ex-wife, who takes everything he owns for [[alimony]] payments. Although the song sounds as if it were recorded live<U+2014>complete with clapping, screaming, and yelling<U+2014>the track was entirely recorded in the studio.<ref name="askalMar0399">{{cite web| url         = http://www.weirdal.com/aaarchive.htm#0399 | title       = "Ask Al" Q&As for March 1999| accessdate  = 29 August 2011| last        = Yankovic| first       = Alfred M.| authorlink  = "Weird Al" Yankovic| year        = 1999| month       = March| work        = The Official "Weird Al" Yankovic Web Site}}</ref>  This is the only instance of Yankovic covering two songs originally made famous by the same artist on one album, as both "Mony Mony" and 'I Think We're Alone Now" were songs first performed by [[Tommy James and the Shondells]].

When Yankovic began writing the song, he originally wanted it to be sung in Italian. He later said, "I was actually going through Italian phrase books and dictionaries until I realized that the humor would be lost on 99% of the audience, so I decided to do the whole thing in English but with kind of a bad Italian accent."<ref name="praitb"/> When the song was released as a single, it did not have a music video. However, ten years later in 1997 a short video was made for the ''[[The Weird Al Show]]''. Under U.S. law, Yankovic can parody any song he wants as long as he pays royalties to use the original music. However, as a personal rule, he asks for permission anyway in order to maintain good relations with the industry.<ref name="askalMay0599">{{cite web| url         = http://www.weirdal.com/aaarchive.htm#0599 | title       = "Ask Al" Q&As for May 1999| accessdate  = 29 August 2011| last        = Yankovic| first       = Alfred M.| authorlink  = "Weird Al" Yankovic| year        = 1999| month       = May| work        = The Official "Weird Al" Yankovic Web Site}}</ref> This particular song is an exception to that rule. Although the song is a parody of the [[Los Lobos]] cover version,<ref name="parodies"/> "Lasagna" marked Yankovic's first parody that did not require either permission from an artist or a payment of royalties, since the song "La Bamba" is a traditional [[folk song]] that is not attributed to any specific writer.
