'''Alfred Matthew "Weird Al" Yankovic''' ({{pronEng|<U+02C8>j<U+00E6><U+014B>k<U+0259>v<U+026A>k}}; born [[October 23]], [[1959]]) is a Grammy-award winning [[United States|American]] [[singer]], [[musician]], [[actor]], [[satire|satirist]], [[parody|parodist]], [[songwriter]], [[music producer]], [[accordion]]ist, and [[television producer]]. Yankovic is known in particular for his humorous songs that make light of [[popular culture]] and that often parody specific songs by contemporary musical acts.
Yankovic received his first [[accordion]] lesson a day before his seventh birthday, and since his first-aired song parody in 1979 has sold more than 12&nbsp;million albums (more than any comedy act in history),<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/09/AR2007080900305.html|last=Harrington|first=Richard|title=Weird Al's Imitation: A Funky Form of Flattery|publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=2007-08-10}}</ref> recorded more than 150 parody and original songs,<ref name="catchup">{{cite web|url=http://ninemsn.video.msn.com/v/en-au/v.htm?f=39&g=b738d4f6-1921-4e6f-9836-1ce2b2b0850c&p=autvshows_authecatchup&t=m2556&mediaid=77139 |title=Weird Al Yankovic's latest send-ups on The Catch-up|accessdate=2007-03-14}}</ref><ref name="catalog">{{cite web|url=http://www.weirdal.com/catalog.htm| title="Weird Al" Yankovic: Catalog|accessdate=2006-10-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weirdal.com/bio.htm| title="Weird Al" Yankovic: Biographies|accessdate=2006-10-28}}</ref> and has performed more than 1,000 live shows.<ref name="livepage">{{cite web|url=http://www.weirdal.com/livepage.htm |title="Weird Al" Yankovic: Live Performances|accessdate=2006-11-10}}</ref> His works have earned him three [[Grammy Award]]s among nine nominations, four [[RIAA certification|gold records]], and six [[RIAA certification|platinum records]] in the United States. Yankovic's first top ten ''[[Billboard charts|Billboard]]'' [[Straight Outta Lynwood|album]] and [[White & Nerdy|single]] were both released in 2006, nearly three decades into his career.

In addition to recording his albums, Yankovic has written and starred in his own film, ''[[UHF (film)|UHF]]'',  and his own television show, ''[[The Weird Al Show]]'', and directed [[music video]]s for himself and other artists including [[Ben Folds]] and [[Hanson (band)|Hanson]]. He has also made guest appearances on television shows such as ''[[Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!]]'', ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[Behind the Music]]'', ''[[Johnny Bravo]]'', ''[[Space Ghost Coast to Coast]]'', ''[[The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy]]'', ''[[Robot Chicken]]'', and ''[[Transformers: Animated]]'' in addition to starring in his own ''[[Al TV]]'' specials.

==Biography==
===Early life===
The only child of Nick Yankovic ([[June 4]], [[1917]]<U+2013>[[April 9]], [[2004]]; an American of [[Serbia]]n descent) and Mary Elizabeth ([[married and maiden names|n<U+00E9>e]] Vivalda; [[February 7]], [[1923]]<U+2013>April 9, 2004, an American of [[Italians|Italian]] and [[English people|English]] descent), Alfred was born in [[Downey, California]], and raised in the town of [[Lynwood, California|Lynwood]].<ref name="faq">{{cite web|url=http://www.weirdal.com/faq.htm |title="Weird Al" Yankovic: Frequently Asked Questions|accessdate=2006-10-28}}</ref> Nick was born in [[Kansas City, Kansas|Kansas City]], [[Kansas]], and began living in [[California]] after serving during [[World War II]].<ref name="booklet">{{cite book | last = Demento | first = Dr. | authorlink = Dr. Demento |  title = Liner notes, Permanent Record | publisher = Scotti Bros. | date = [[September 27]], [[1994]] |   url =http://php.indiana.edu/~jbmorris/FAQ/al.booklet |  id = | isbn = B00000I029 }}</ref>

Mary, who had come to California from [[Kentucky]], gave birth to Alfred ten years later.<ref name="booklet"/>

Alfred's first accordion lesson, which sparked his career in music, was on [[October 22]], [[1966]], a day before his seventh birthday.  A door-to-door salesman traveling through Lynwood offered the Yankovic parents a choice of accordion or [[guitar]] lessons at a local music school. Yankovic claims the reason his parents chose accordion over guitar was "They figured there should be at least one more accordion-playing Yankovic in the world", referring to [[Frankie Yankovic]], to whom he has no relation.<ref name="booklet">{{cite web|url=http://php.indiana.edu/~jbmorris/FAQ/al.booklet |title=Permanent Record: Al In The Box|accessdate=2006-08-24}}</ref>  He continued lessons at the school for three years before continuing to learn on his own.<ref name="faq">{{cite web|url=http://www.weirdal.com/faq.htm |title="Weird Al" Yankovic: Frequently Asked Questions|accessdate=2006-10-28}}</ref> Yankovic's early accordion role models include Frankie Yankovic and [[Myron Floren]] (the accordionist on ''[[The Lawrence Welk Show]]'').  In the 1970s, Yankovic was a big fan of [[Elton John]] and claims John's ''[[Goodbye Yellow Brick Road]]'' album "was partly how I learned to play rock 'n roll on the accordion."<ref name="booklet"/>  He would repeatedly play the album and try to play along on his accordion.  As for his influences in comedic and parody music, Yankovic lists artists including [[Tom Lehrer]], [[Stan Freberg]], [[Spike Jones]], [[Allan Sherman]], [[Shel Silverstein]] and [[Frank Zappa]] "and all the other wonderfully sick and twisted artists that he was exposed to through the [[Dr. Demento]] Radio Show."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.myspace.com/weirdal |title="Weird Al" Yankovic on MySpace|accessdate=2007-04-02}}</ref><ref name="faq"/>  Other sources of inspiration for his comedy come from [[Mad (magazine)|Mad magazine]],<ref name="booklet"/> [[Monty Python]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://podcasts.triplem.com.au/audio/20070307_spoon_best_weirdalredux.mp3 |title="Weird Al" Yankovic interview by Spoonman on Triple M Australia|accessdate=2007-04-02}}</ref> and the [[Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker]] parody movies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weirdal.com/aaarchive.htm#0494 |title=Midnight Star "Ask Al" Q&As for April, 1994|accessdate=2007-04-02}}</ref>

Yankovic began [[kindergarten]] a year earlier than most children, and he skipped the second grade. "My classmates seemed to think I was some kind of rocket scientist so I was labeled a [[nerd]] early on", he recalls.<ref name="booklet"/>  As his unusual schooling left him two years younger than most of his classmates, Yankovic was not interested in sports or social events at school. He claims to have been a straight-A student throughout high school, which earned him the honor of becoming [[valedictorian]] of his senior class.<ref name="booklet"/> Yankovic was fairly active in his school's extracurricular programs, including the [[National Forensic League]] (in which he "usually brought home some kind of trophy"), a play based upon ''[[Rebel Without a Cause]]'', the yearbook program (for which he wrote most of the captions), and the Volcano Worshipper's Club, "which did absolutely nothing. We started the club just to get an extra picture of ourselves in the yearbook."<ref name="booklet"/>

===Dr. Demento, "My Bologna," and early fame===
In 1976, Yankovic, then a high school senior, sent a homemade [[Compact Cassette|tape]] to [[Dr. Demento]], the host of a [[comedy]] radio program.<ref name="booklet"/>  The tape's first song was "Belvedere Cruisin", about his family's [[Plymouth Belvedere]]; another song included on the tape (which never received airtime) was "Dr. D Superstar", a parody of the title song from the musical ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]''.<ref name="unlabeled tape">{{cite web|url=http://weirdal.com/rare89.htm |title="Weird Al" Yankovic: Rare Items: UNLABELED TAPE |accessdate=2006-08-24}}</ref> Demento said "'Belvedere Cruising' might not have been the very best song I ever heard, but it had some clever lines [...] I put the tape on the air immediately."<ref name="booklet"/> Yankovic also played at local coffeehouses saying,
{{cquote|It was sort of like amateur music night, and a lot of people were like wannabe [[Dan Fogelberg]]s. They'd get up on stage with their acoustic guitar and do these lovely ballads. And I would get up with my accordion and play the theme from '2001.' And people were kind of shocked that I would be disrupting their mellow Thursday night folk fest.<ref>"[http://www.nj.com/entertainment/ledger/index.ssf?/base/entertainment-1/1186722311157340.xml&coll=1 The clown prince of song parodies].", ''[[The Star-Ledger]]'', [[August 10]], [[2007]]. p14. " A native of Lynwood (a Los Angeles suburb), Yankovic entered show business modestly, with unsolicited submissions to Dr. Demento's syndicated radio show and coffeehouse appearances. "It was sort of like amateur music night, and a lot of people were like wannabe Dan Fogelbergs", he says. "They'd get up on stage with their acoustic guitar and do these lovely ballads. And I would get up with my accordion and play the theme from '2001.' And people were kind of shocked that I would be disrupting their mellow Thursday night folk fest."</ref>}}

During Yankovic's sophomore year as an [[architecture]] student at [[California Polytechnic State University|Cal Poly San Luis Obispo]], he became a [[disc jockey]] at the university's radio station, [[KCPR]]. Yankovic said he had been nicknamed "Weird Al" by fellow students and "took it on professionally" as his persona for the station.<ref name="booklet"/> In 1978, he released his first recording (as Alfred Yankovic), "Take Me Down", on the LP, ''Slo Grown'', as a benefit for the Economic Opportunity Commission of [[San Luis Obispo County, California|San Luis Obispo County]].  The song mocked famous nearby landmarks such as the fountain toilets at [[Madonna Inn]].

In mid-1979, shortly before his senior year, "[[My Sharona]]" by [[The Knack]] was on the charts and Yankovic took his accordion into the restroom across the hall from the radio station (to take advantage of the [[echo chamber]] acoustics) and recorded a parody entitled "[[My Bologna]]". He sent it to [[Dr. Demento]], who played it to good response from listeners.  Yankovic met The Knack after a show at his college, and introduced himself as the author of "My Bologna". The Knack's lead singer, [[Doug Fieger]], said he liked the song and suggested that [[Capitol Records]] vice president [[Rupert Perry]] release the song as a single.<ref name="booklet"/> "My Bologna" was released as a single with "School Cafeteria" as its B-side, and the label gave Yankovic a six-month recording contract.<ref name="btm">{{cite video|people=McNamara, Michael (Director) |title=[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0520918/ Behind the Music: "Weird Al" Yankovic]|medium=TV series|publisher=VH1|date=1999}}</ref>  Yankovic, who was "only getting average grades" in his architecture degree, began to realize that he might make a career of comedic music.<ref name="booklet"/>

On [[September 14]], [[1980]], Yankovic was a guest on the Dr. Demento Show, where he was to record a new parody live. The song was called "[[Another One Rides the Bus]]", a parody of [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s hit, "[[Another One Bites the Dust]]". While practicing the song outside the sound booth, he met [[Jon Schwartz (drummer)|Jon "Bermuda" Schwartz]], who told him he was a drummer and agreed to bang on Yankovic's accordion case to help Yankovic keep a steady beat during the song. They rehearsed the song just a few times before the show began.<ref name="booklet"/> "Another One Rides the Bus" became so popular that Yankovic's first television appearance was a performance of the song on the ''[[Tomorrow (TV series)|The Tomorrow Show]]'' ([[April 21]], [[1981]]) with [[Tom Snyder]]. On the show, Yankovic played his accordion, and again, Schwartz banged on the accordion case and provided comical sound effects.

===The band and fame=== 
1981 brought Yankovic on tour for the first time as part of Dr. Demento's stage show. His stage act in a [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], [[Arizona]], nightclub caught the eye of manager Jay Levey, who was "blown away".<ref name="booklet"/> Levey asked Yankovic if he had considered creating a full [[Musical ensemble|band]] and doing his music as a career. Yankovic admitted that he had, so Levey held auditions. [[Steve Jay]] became Yankovic's [[bass guitar|bass]] player, and Jay's friend [[Jim West (guitarist)|Jim West]] played guitar. Schwartz continued on [[drum kit|drums]]. Yankovic's first show with his new band was on [[March 31]], [[1982]].<ref name="livepage"/>  Several days later, Yankovic and his band were the opening act for [[Missing Persons (band)|Missing Persons]]. The unimpressed audience [[Bottling (concert abuse)|threw items at the group]], and they were booed off the stage.<ref name="btm"/>

Yankovic recorded "[[I Love Rocky Road]]" (a parody of "[[I Love Rock 'n' Roll]]" as recorded by [[Joan Jett|Joan Jett and The Blackhearts]]) in 1982.  Due to the influence of his new producer, [[Rick Derringer]], it managed to become a hit on Top 40 radio, leading to Yankovic's signing with [[Scotti Brothers Records]]. In 1983, Yankovic's first [["Weird Al" Yankovic (album)|self-titled album]] was released on Scotti Bros. He released his second album ''[["Weird Al" Yankovic in 3-D]]'' in 1984. The first single "[[Eat It]]", a parody of the [[Michael Jackson]] song "[[Beat It]]", became quite popular, thanks in part to the music video, a shot-for-shot parody of Jackson's "Beat It" music video, and to Yankovic's self-styled "uncanny resemblance" to Jackson. Peaking at number 12 on the [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]], "Eat It" remained Yankovic's highest-charting single until "[[White & Nerdy]]" placed at number 9 in October 2006.

In 1985, Yankovic co-wrote and starred in a [[mockumentary]] of his own life entitled ''[[The Compleat Al]]'', which intertwined the facts of his life up to that point with fiction. The movie also featured some clips from Yankovic's trip to [[Japan]] and some clips from the ''[[Al TV]]'' specials. ''The Compleat Al'' was co-directed by Jay Levey, who would direct ''[[UHF (film)|UHF]]'' four years later. Also released around the same time as ''The Compleat Al'' was ''The Authorized Al'', a biographical book based on the film.  The book, resembling a scrapbook, included real and fictional humorous photographs and documents.

Yankovic and his band toured as the opening act for [[The Monkees]] in mid-1987 for their second reunion tour of [[North America]]. Yankovic claims to have enjoyed touring with The Monkees, despite the fact "the promoter gypped us out of a bunch of money."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weirdal.com/aaarchive.htm#1198 |title="Ask Al" Q&As for November, 1998|accessdate=2007-06-05}}</ref>

Yankovic also appeared on the [[Wendy Carlos]] recording of [[Sergei Prokofiev|Prokofiev]]'s [[Peter and the Wolf|"Peter and the Wolf"]] as the narrator in 1988. The album also included a sequel of [[Camille Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns]]'s composition [[The Carnival of the Animals]] entitled the "Carnival of the Animals Part II", with Yankovic providing humorous poems for each of the featured creatures in the style of [[Ogden Nash]], who had written humorous poems for the original. [[Rub<U+00E9>n Valtierra]] joined the band on keyboards in 1991, allowing Yankovic to concentrate more on singing and increasing his use of the stage space during concerts.

A factual biographical booklet of Yankovic's life, written by [[Dr. Demento]], was released with the 1994 box set compilation ''[[Permanent Record: Al in the Box]]''.<ref name="booklet"/>  The Dr. Demento Society, which issues yearly [[Christmas]] re-releases of material from Dr. Demento's Basement Tapes, often includes unreleased tracks from Yankovic's vaults, such as "Pacman", "It's Still Billy Joel To Me" or the live version of "School Cafeteria".

===New look, personal life, and career to present===
[[Image:Weirdalclassic.jpg|thumb|Yankovic's "classic" look before eye surgery, with glasses, mustache and afro]]

On [[January 24]], [[1998]], Yankovic had [[LASIK]] eye surgery to correct his extreme [[myopia]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://weirdal.com/thelook1.htm|title=LASIK story and pictures}}</ref>.  In the same period, he shaved off his [[moustache]] and grew out his hair, thus radically changing his trademark look. (He had previously shaved his mustache in 1983 for the video of [[Ricky (song)|Ricky]] in order to resemble [[Desi Arnaz]] more closely, and in 1996 for his "[[Amish Paradise]]" video.) Yankovic reasoned, "If [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s allowed to reinvent herself every 15&nbsp;minutes, I figure I should be good for a change at least once every twenty years."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20010208173222/http://www.weirdal.com/bio.htm |title=Archive.org for www.weirdal.com/bio.htm for [[February 8]], [[2001]]|accessdate=2006-10-29}}</ref> He parodied the reaction to this "new look" in a commercial for his nonexistent [[MTV Unplugged]] special. The commercial featured Yankovic in the short-haired wig from the music video for "[[The Saga Begins]]", claiming his new look was an attempt to "get back to the core of what I'm all about", that being "the music."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.al-oholicsanonymous.com/videos/EatItUnpluggedPromo.wmv |title="Weird Al" Yankovic MTV Unplugged Promo|accessdate=2006-10-28}}</ref>

Yankovic married Suzanne Krajewski on [[February 10]], [[2001]]. Their daughter, Nina, was born [[February 11]], [[2003]]. They also have a pet [[cockatiel]] named Bo Veaner. <ref name="faq"/>They used to have a pet [[poodle]], Bela (pictured atop Yankovic's head on the cover of his album, ''[[Poodle Hat]]'').  Despite songs such as "[[Pretty Fly for a Rabbi]]", his frequent use of "[[Oy vey]]" and other [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] phrases, Yankovic is not of [[Jew]]ish ancestry, and identifies himself as a [[Christianity|Christian]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weirdal.com/aaarchive.htm#0795 |title=Midnight Star "Ask Al" Q&As for July, 1995|accessdate=2007-04-04}}</ref>

Yankovic changed his diet to become a [[Veganism|vegan]] in 1992, after a fan of his gave him the book  ''[[John Robbins (author)|Diet for a New America]]'' and he felt "it made [...] a very compelling argument for a strict vegetarian diet."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weirdal.com/aaarchive.htm#0195 |title=Midnight Star "Ask Al" Q&As for January, 1995|accessdate=2007-04-04}}</ref>   When asked how he can "rationalize" performing at events such as the ''Great American Rib Cook-Off'' when he is a vegetarian, he replied "The same way I can rationalize playing at a college even though I<U+2019>m not a student anymore."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weirdal.com/aaarchive.htm#0500 |title="Ask Al" Q&As for May, 2000|accessdate=2007-06-23}}</ref>

On [[April 9]], [[2004]], Yankovic's parents, Nick, 86, and Mary, 81, were found dead in their [[Fallbrook, California]], home, apparently the victims of accidental [[carbon monoxide poisoning]] from their fireplace that had been recently lit. The [[flue]] was closed, which trapped the carbon monoxide gas inside the house, suffocating them. An hour after his wife notified him of his parents' death, Yankovic went on with his concert in [[Appleton, Wisconsin]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/northcounty/20040410-9999-1mc10ffire.html |title=Fallbrook couple found dead  |accessdate=2007-02-16}}</ref> saying that "since my music had helped many of my fans through tough times, maybe it would work for me as well" and that it would "at least ... give me a break from sobbing all the time."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weirdal.com/msg.htm |title=A Message From Al|accessdate=2006-08-24}}</ref>

Yankovic's career in novelty and comedy music has outlasted many of his "mainstream" parody targets, such as [[Toni Basil]], [[MC Hammer]], [[Men Without Hats]], and [[Crash Test Dummies]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spokane7.com/music/stories/?ID=401 |title=Weird Al's shtick still draws a crowd |accessdate=2006-10-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.townonline.com/northshoresunday/homepage/x1575047109 |title=Revenge of the nerd: 'Weird Al' gets all white and nerdy for summer tour |accessdate=2007-08-13}}</ref>  While most [[novelty song|novelty artists]] are [[one-hit wonder]]s, Yankovic's continued success (including the top 10 single "[[White & Nerdy]]" and album ''[[Straight Outta Lynwood]]'' in 2006) has enabled him to escape the stigma often associated with novelty music.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tweak.com/phonetag/weirdal/ |title=Tweak: Phone Tag - Weird Al Yankovic |accessdate=2006-10-16}}</ref>

==Yankovic's work==
===Music===
{{main|List of songs by "Weird Al" Yankovic}}
While Yankovic's song parodies (such as "[[Eat It]]") have resulted in success on the Billboard charts (''see [[List of singles by "Weird Al" Yankovic]]''), he has actually recorded an equally large number of original humorous songs ("[[You Don't Love Me Anymore]]" and "[[One More Minute]]").<ref name="faq"/> His work depends largely on the satirizing of [[popular culture]], including television (''see [[The TV Album]]''), movies ("[[The Saga Begins]]"), food (''see [[The Food Album]]''), popular music (the polkas), and sometimes issues in contemporary news ("[[Headline News (song)|Headline News]]").  Yankovic claims he has no intention of writing "serious" music.  In his reasoning, "There's enough people that do unfunny music.  I'll leave the serious stuff to [[Paris Hilton]] and [[Kevin Federline]]."<ref name="hub">{{cite web|url=http://hub.lsj.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070702/NOISE02/707040313/1104/HUB |title='Weird Al' Yankovic - Parodist promises a high-energy show -- with costume changes|accessdate=2007-07-08}}</ref>

Although many of Yankovic's songs are parodies of contemporary radio hits, it is rare that the song's primary topic lampoons the original artist as a person, or the song itself. Most Yankovic songs consist of the original song's music, with a separate, unrelated set of amusing lyrics. Exceptions include "[[Smells Like Nirvana]]", which references unintelligible lyrics in "[[Smells Like Teen Spirit]]", "[[Achy Breaky Song]]", which refers to the song "[[Achy Breaky Heart]]", "(This Song's Just) Six Words Long", which refers to the repetitious lyrics in "[[Got My Mind Set on You]]", the unreleased "It's Still Billy Joel to Me", and "[[Confessions_Part_III#Track_listing|Confessions Part III]]", which references "[[Confessions (Usher album)|Confessions]]" and "[[Confessions (Usher album)|Confessions Part II]]" in the first few lines.

Yankovic's humor normally lies more in creating unexpected incongruity between an artist's image and the topic of the song, contrasting the style of the song with its content (such as the [[rapping|rap]] songs "[[Amish Paradise]]" and "[[White & Nerdy]]"), or in pointing out trends or works which have become pop culture clich<U+00E9>s (such as "[[eBay (song)|eBay]]" and "[[Don't Download This Song]]").

Yankovic is the sole writer for all his songs, and for "legal and personal reasons" does not accept parody submissions or ideas from fans.<ref name="faq"/>  There exists, however, one exception to this rule in the case of "[[Like a Surgeon]]."  [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] was reportedly talking with a friend and happened to wonder aloud when Yankovic was going to turn her "[[Like a Virgin (song)|Like a Virgin]]" into "Like a Surgeon."  Madonna's friend was a mutual friend of Yankovic's manager, Jay Levey, and eventually Yankovic himself heard the story from Levey.<ref name="booklet"/>

Unlike other parody artists such as [[Tom Lehrer]] and [[Allan Sherman]], Yankovic strives to keep the backing music in his parodies the same as the original. While Lehrer reproduced the songs on piano and Sherman reproduced them orchestrally, Yankovic and his band essentially play the original song with new lyrics. Instead of using instrumental versions of the original songs, Yankovic and his band transcribe the original song by ear and re-record the song for Yankovic's parody version.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weirdalforum.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=4730&view=findpost&p=306317 |title=World of Weird Al Yankovic Forums - Ask Jim|accessdate=2006-10-30}}</ref>

In addition to his parodies, Yankovic also includes a medley of various songs on most albums, each one reinterpreted as a [[polka]], with the choruses or memorable lines of various songs juxtaposed for humorous effect. Yankovic has been known to say that converting these songs to polka was "<U+2026>the way God intended."  Because the polkas have become a staple of Yankovic's albums, he has said he tries to include one on each album because "fans would be rioting in the streets, I think, if I didn't do a polka medley."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.livedaily.com/news/Weird_Al_talks_new_album_2007_tour-10776.html?t=1 |title='Weird Al' talks new album, 2007 tour|accessdate=2006-10-26}}</ref>

<!-- Please stop adding style parody artists/songs to the following paragraph, as there are too many now. -->
Some of Yankovic's original songs are [[pastiche]]s or "style parodies", for which he chooses a band's entire body of work to honor/parody, rather than any single hit by that band. Such bands include [[Devo]] with "[[Dare to Be Stupid (song)|Dare to Be Stupid]]", [[Talking Heads]] with "Dog Eat Dog", [[Frank Zappa]] with "Genius in France", [[Nine Inch Nails]] with "Germs", or most recently, [[charity record]]s with "[[Don't Download This Song]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weirdal.com/aaarchive.htm#0100 |title="Ask Al" Q&As for January, 2000|accessdate=2006-10-30}}</ref> Others are style parodies in the style of a [[music genre|genre]] of music, rather than a specific band (for example, [[country music]] with "Good Enough For Now").

Yankovic has contributed original songs to several [[film]]s ("[[This Is the Life (song)|This Is the Life]]" from ''[[Johnny Dangerously]]''; "[[Polkamon]]" from the movie ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon: The Movie 2000]]'', and a parody of the [[James Bond]] title sequence in ''[[Spy Hard]]''), in addition to his own film, ''[[UHF (film)|UHF]]''. Other songs of his have appeared in films or television series as well, such as "[[Dare to Be Stupid (song)|Dare to Be Stupid]]" in ''[[The Transformers: The Movie]]''.

Yankovic's recurring jokes include the number [[27 (number)|27]] (as seen on the covers for ''[[Running with Scissors (album)|Running With Scissors]]'', ''[[Poodle Hat]]'', and ''[[Straight Outta Lynwood]]'') and the names Bob (the ''[[Al TV]]'' interviews often mention the name),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGiUu2ciYY |title=Weird Al Interviews Avril Lavigne|accessdate=2006-10-29}}</ref> Frank (e.g. "Frank's 2000" TV"), and the surname "Finkelstein" (e.g. the music video for "[[I Lost on Jeopardy]]").  Also, a [[hamster]] called [[Harvey the Wonder Hamster]] is a recurring character in ''[[The Weird Al Show]]'' and the ''Al TV'' specials, as well as the subject of an original song on ''[[Alapalooza]]''.  Yankovic has also put two [[backmasking]] messages into his songs.  The first, in "Nature Trail to Hell", said "Satan Eats [[Cheez Whiz]]"; the second, in "I Remember Larry", said "Wow, you must have an awful lot of free time on your hands."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.al-oholicsanonymous.com/faq/#secret |title=Al-oholics Anonymous' Frequently Asked Questions|accessdate=2006-08-24}}</ref>

His latest three album releases feature the longest songs Yankovic has ever released. The "[[Albuquerque (song)|Albuquerque]]" track from ''Running with Scissors'' is 11&nbsp;minutes and 23&nbsp;seconds; "Genius in France" from ''Poodle Hat'' runs for 8&nbsp;minutes and 56&nbsp;seconds; "Trapped in the Drive-Thru" from ''Straight Outta Lynwood'' is 10&nbsp;minutes and 53&nbsp;seconds long. Before 2007, (apart from a one-off performance of "Albuquerque" in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]]),<ref name="setlists">{{cite web|url=http://www.weirdal.com/setlists.htm |title="Weird Al" Yankovic: Concert Set Lists|accessdate=2006-10-28}}</ref> these "epic" songs were not performed live in their entirety due to their length and complexity.  ''(See [[#Live performances|Live performances]] for details)''

====Music videos====
While Yankovic's music generally does not parody the song or the artist of the original song, Yankovic's music videos will sometimes incorporate parodies of many elements of the original song's music video, or otherwise spoof the general style of the music.  Most notably, the video for "[[Smells Like Nirvana]]" uses an extremely similar set to [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]'s "[[Smells Like Teen Spirit]]", including using several of the same actors.  This video contended with "Smells like Teen Spirit" at the 1992 [[MTV Video Music Awards]] for Best Male Video.  Other videos that are parodies of their original song videos include "[[Eat It]]", "[[Fat (song)|Fat]]", "[[Money for Nothing/Beverly Hillbillies*]]", "[[Bedrock Anthem]]", "[[Headline News]]", and "[[White & Nerdy]]".  The video for "[[Dare to Be Stupid]]" is, as stated by Yankovic, a style parody in general of [[Devo]] videos.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weirdal.com/aaarchive.htm#0100 |title="Ask Al" Q&As for January, 2000" |accessdate=2007-08-05}}</ref>  "[[It's All about the Pentiums]]" is a parody of "[[It's All about the Benjamins]]" by [[Sean Combs|Puff Daddy]]. Recent videos have included notable celebrities in addition to Yankovic and his band; for example, [[Dick Van Patten]] is featured in both "Smells Like Nirvana" and "[[Bedrock Anthem]]", [[Drew Carey]], [[Emo Philips]], and [[Phil LaMarr]] appear in "It's All About the Pentiums", and [[Keegan-Michael Key]], [[Jordan Peele]], [[Donny Osmond]] and [[Seth Green]] appear in "White & Nerdy".

====Reactions from original artists====
Under the "[[fair use]]" provision of U.S. [[copyright]] law, affirmed by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]], one does not need permission to record a [[parody]].<ref>''[[Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.]]'', {{Findlaw_us|510|569}} (1994)</ref> However, as a personal rule, and as a means of maintaining good relationships within the music community, Yankovic has always requested permission from the original artist before recording his parodies.<ref name="faq"/> Most artists have had positive reactions to Yankovic's parodies.  Several have considered it to be something of a badge of honor to have Yankovic ask permission to parody their song or style, since they felt that Yankovic would not choose to do so unless they were a success or had made an impact on the music scene at the time. However, there are a few notable exceptions where people have not allowed parodies or have otherwise withdrawn permission.

=====Positive=====
[[Dave Grohl]] of [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] said that the band felt they had "made it" after Yankovic recorded "[[Smells Like Nirvana]]", a parody of the [[Grunge music|grunge]] band's smash hit, "[[Smells Like Teen Spirit]]".<ref name="faq"/> On his ''Behind the Music'' special, Yankovic stated that when he called Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain to ask if he could parody the song, Cobain gave him permission, then paused and asked, "Um ...  it's not gonna be about food, is it?" Yankovic responded with "No, it'll be about how no one can understand your lyrics".<ref name="btm"/> According to members of Nirvana interviewed for ''Behind the Music'', when they saw the video of the song, they laughed hysterically. Additionally, Cobain described Yankovic as "a musical genius."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/gig-previews--reviews/weird-al-yankovic/2007/03/19/1174152930142.html |title=Weird Al Yankovic - Gig previews & reviews - Music - Entertainment|accessdate= 2007-04-16}}</ref>

[[Image:Yankovic-TheSagaBegins.jpg|left|thumb|Yankovic performing [[The Saga Begins]] in [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]] on [[March 10]], [[2007]].]][[Michael Jackson]] is also a big fan of Yankovic. Jackson has twice allowed him to parody his songs ("[[Beat It]]" and "[[Bad (Michael Jackson song)|Bad]]" became "[[Eat It]]" and "[[Fat (song)|Fat]]", respectively). When he granted Yankovic permission to do "Fat", Jackson allowed him to use the same set built for his own "Bad" video from the ''[[Moonwalker]]'' video.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://music.aol.com/artist/weird-al-yankovic/140212/biography |title=Weird Al Yankovic - Biography - AOL Music|accessdate=2006-10-28}}</ref>  Though Jackson allowed "Eat It" and "Fat", he requested that Yankovic not record a parody of "[[Black or White]]", because he felt the message was too important. However, Yankovic has performed a concert-only parody "Snack All Night" in some of his live shows.<ref name="setlists"/> Yankovic also has a cameo appearance, along with many other celebrities, in Jackson's music video for "[[Liberian Girl]]".

[[Mark Knopfler]] approved Yankovic's parody of the [[Dire Straits]] song "[[Money for Nothing (song)|Money for Nothing]]" for use in the film ''[[UHF (film)|UHF]]'' on the provision that Knopfler himself be allowed to play lead guitar on the parody which was later titled "[[Money for Nothing/Beverly Hillbillies*]]",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0946148/bio |title=Biography for 'Weird Al' Yankovic|accessdate=2007-09-15}}</ref>.  Yankovic commented on the legal complications of the parody in the DVD audio commentary for ''UHF'', explaining "We had to name that song 'Money for Nothing 'slash' Beverly Hillbillies 'asterisk' because the lawyers told us that had to be the name. Those wacky lawyers! What ya gonna do?"<ref>Al Yankovic, "UHF" DVD Audio Commentary (0:35:15)</ref>  The ''[[Permanent Record: Al in the Box]]'' booklet referred to the song's "compound fracture of a title."<ref name="booklet"/>  When a fan asked about the song's title, Yankovic shared his feelings on the title, replying "That incredibly stupid name is what the lawyers insisted that the parody be listed as. I'm not sure why, and I've obviously never been very happy about it."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weirdal.com/aaarchive.htm#1098|title="Ask Al" Q&As for October, 1998|accessdate=2007-09-15}}</ref>

[[The Presidents of the United States of America (band)|The Presidents of the United States of America]] were so pleased with "Gump", Yankovic's parody of their song "Lump", that they ended the song with Yankovic's last line instead of their own ("And that's all I have to say about that") on the live recording of "Lump" featured on the compilation album ''[[Pure Frosting]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/presidents_of_the_united_states_of_america/lump_live-lyrics-945109.html |title=Allthelyrics.com - Lyrics to Lump (live) by The Presidents of the United States of America|accessdate=2008-03-15}}</ref> In 2008, Yankovic directed the music video for their song "[[Mixed Up S.O.B.]]"<ref>{{cite web|url= http://blogs.thenewstribune.com/ej/2008/02/04/weird_al_yankovic_to_direct_next_preside|title=Bring the Noise Weird Al Yankovic to direct next Presidents of the United States of America video |publisher=[[The News Tribune]]|author=Ernest Jasmin|accessdate=2008-05-31}}</ref>

The song "[[The Saga Begins]]" (a parody of [[Don McLean]]'s "[[American Pie]]") accurately states the entire plot of ''[[Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace|The Phantom Menace]]'', despite being written before the film's release. Yankovic got the plot details from [[rumor]] websites. He was slightly unsure about [[Darth Vader|Anakin]] proposing to [[Padm<U+00E9> Amidala|Amidala]], so he attended a [[United States dollar|US$]]500 screening to confirm, and ended up making only very minor alterations to the lyrics. McLean was pleased with the parody, and even told Yankovic that the parody's lyrics sometimes enter his mind during live performances.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://weirdal.com/aaarchive.htm#0999|title="Ask Al" Q&As for September, 1999| accessdate=2006-10-29}}</ref>  Yankovic's parody not only replicates the music from the original [[Don McLean]] song, but it also replicates the multi-layered rhyming structure in the verses and chorus. Additionally, [[George Lucas]] loved the song and a [[Lucasfilm]] representative told Yankovic, "You should have seen the smile on his face."<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.theforce.net/jedicouncil/interview/weirdal.asp |title=TheForce.Net - Jedi Council -  Interviews - Weird Al Yankovic |publisher=TheForce.Net|author=Chris Knight|accessdate=2006-08-24}}</ref>

[[Chamillionaire]] was also very pleased, even putting Yankovic's parody "[[White & Nerdy]]" on his official [[MySpace]] page before it was on Yankovic's own page. Chamillionaire stated in an interview, "He's actually [[rapping]] pretty good on it, it's crazy [...] I didn't know he could rap like that.  It's really an honor when he does that. [...] Weird Al is not gonna do a parody of your song if you're not doing it big."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/m/mixtape_monday/091106/ |title=MTVNews.com - Mixtape Monday: Lil Wayne, Juelz To Drop Real Album; Ness Drops Da Band|accessdate=2006-10-28}}</ref>  In September of 2007, Chamillionaire credited "White & Nerdy" for his recent Grammy win, stating "That parody was the reason I won the Grammy, because it made the record so big it was undeniable. It was so big overseas that people were telling me they had heard my version of Weird Al's song."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/music/news/2007-09-16-chamillionaire_N.htm |title=Chamillionaire triumphs over cursing on 'Ultimate Victory' |author=Steve Jones |publisher=USA Today |accessdate = 2007-09-20}}</ref>

=====Negative=====
One of Yankovic's most controversial parodies was 1996's "[[Amish Paradise]]", based on "[[Gangsta's Paradise (song)|Gangsta's Paradise]]" by hip-hop artist [[Coolio]], which, in turn, was based on "[[Songs in the Key of Life|Pastime Paradise]]" by [[Stevie Wonder]]. Reportedly, Coolio's label gave Yankovic the impression that Coolio had granted permission to record the parody, but Coolio maintains that he never did. While Coolio claimed he was upset, legal action never materialized, and Coolio accepted  [[Royalties|royalty]] payments for the song. After this controversy, Yankovic has always made sure to speak directly with the artist of every song he parodied. At the [[XM Satellite Radio]] booth at the 2006 [[Consumer Electronics Show]] Yankovic and Coolio made peace. On his website, Yankovic wrote of this event, "I don<U+2019>t remember what we said to each other exactly, but it was all very friendly. I doubt I<U+2019>ll be invited to Coolio<U+2019>s next birthday party, but at least I can stop wearing that bulletproof vest to the mall."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weirdal.com/aaarchive.htm#042706 |title="Ask Al" Q&As for April 27, 2006|accessdate=2006-09-02}}</ref>

In 2003, Yankovic was denied permission to make a video for "[[Couch Potato (song)|Couch Potato]]", his parody of [[Eminem]]'s "[[Lose Yourself]]":
{{cquote|Last year, Eminem forced me to halt production on the video for my 'Lose Yourself' parody because he somehow thought that it would be harmful to his image or career.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4155/is_20041014/ai_n12565818 |title=Is the King of Pop losing it? |author=Mike Thomas |publisher=Chicago Sun-Times |accessdate = 2006-10-29}}</ref>}}
For the ''[[Poodle Hat]]'' ''[[Al TV]]'' special, Yankovic raised the question of artistic expression in a false interview with Eminem. As Yankovic has always done for his ''Al TV'' specials, he edited the footage of a previous Eminem interview and inserted himself asking questions for comic effect.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPwBdnknGIs |title=Eminem Interview |accessdate=2008-01-15}}</ref>

=====Refused parodies=====
On numerous occasions, [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] has refused Yankovic permission to record parodies of his songs. Yankovic has stated in interviews that he has "approached him every few years [to] see if he's lightened up."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.al-oholicsanonymous.com/interviews/hotwired.txt |title="Weird Al" Yankovic Interview by Michael Small of Hotwired.com|accessdate=2006-10-28}}</ref>

[[Paul McCartney]], also a Yankovic fan, refused Yankovic permission to record a parody of [[Wings (band)|Wings]]' "[[Live and Let Die (song)|Live and Let Die]]", entitled "Chicken Pot Pie", because McCartney is a vegetarian and did not wish to condone the eating of meat.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.al-oholicsanonymous.com/interviews/alicon.html |title="Weird Al" Yankovic: The Icon Profile|accessdate=2006-10-28}}</ref>  Yankovic, who is a vegetarian as well, has stated that he respects McCartney's decision to refuse the parody, and is hesitant to "put Paul on the list" of artists who have refused permission for a parody.<ref name="catchup"/> However, like "Snack All Night", "Chicken Pot Pie" has been performed numerous times in concert.<ref name="setlists"/> His concerts often feature parodies for which the artist did not give permission or could not be released for various reasons.

[[Image:White Nerdy YOU SUCK cropped.jpg|thumb|Weird Al expresses his opinion about [[Atlantic Records]] on [[Wikipedia]], as shown in the music video of "[[White & Nerdy]]".]]

In 2006, Yankovic gained [[James Blunt]]'s permission to record a parody of "[[You're Beautiful]]". However, after Yankovic had recorded "[[You're Pitiful]]", Blunt's label, Atlantic Records, rescinded this permission. The parody was pulled from Yankovic's ''[[Straight Outta Lynwood]]'' due to his label's unwillingness to "go to war" with Atlantic. Yankovic released the song as a free download on his [[MySpace]] profile, as well as his official website, and plays it in concert, since it was not Blunt himself objecting to the parody.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5482774 |title=Free 'Weird Al' Yankovic!|accessdate=2006-08-24}}</ref>

===''UHF''===
{{main|UHF (film)}}
In 1989, Yankovic starred in a full-length feature film, co-written by himself and manager [[Jay Levey]], and filmed in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]] called ''[[UHF (film)|UHF]]''. A satire of the television and film industries, also starring [[Michael Richards]], [[Fran Drescher]], and [[Victoria Jackson]], it brought floundering studio [[Orion Pictures|Orion]] their highest [[test screening|test scores]] since the movie ''[[RoboCop]]''.<ref name="robo">{{cite web|url=http://www.weirdal.com/aaarchive.htm#0599 |title="Ask Al" Q&As for May, 1999|accessdate=2006-10-28}}</ref> However, it was unsuccessful in theaters, likely due to a release in mid-1989, going up against ''[[Ghostbusters II]]'', ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]'', ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'', and others.

The film has since become a [[Cult film|cult classic]], with out-of-print copies of the [[VHS]] version selling for up to $100 on [[eBay]] until the release of the [[DVD]] in 2002. Yankovic occasionally shows clips from the film at his concerts (to which [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]], the film's current owner, initially  objected in the form of a [[cease and desist]] letter).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weirdal.com/aaarchive.htm#0500 |title="Ask Al" Q&As for May, 2000|accessdate=2006-10-26}}</ref>  To apparently make it more accessible to overseas audiences where [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] TV stations were less prominent, the film was titled ''[[UHF (film)|The Vidiot From UHF]]'' in Australia and parts of [[Europe]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098546/ |title=UHF (1989)|accessdate=2006-10-26}}</ref>

''UHF'' shows the creation of Yankovic's signature food<U+2014>the Twinkie Wiener Sandwich. The snack consists of an overturned [[Twinkie]] split open as a makeshift bun, a [[hot dog]], and [[Easy Cheese]]. Yankovic has stated that he has switched to using [[tofu]] hot dogs since becoming a [[Vegetarianism|vegetarian]], but still enjoys the occasional Twinkie Wiener Sandwich.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weirdal.com/aaarchive.htm#1095 |title=Midnight Star "Ask Al" Q&As for October/November, 1995|accessdate=2006-10-26}}</ref>

===Notable television appearances===
Yankovic had a TV series called ''[[The Weird Al Show]]'', which aired from September 1997 to December 1997 on [[CBS]]. Though the show appeared to be geared at children, the humor was really more for his adult fans (as such, it is often compared to ''[[Pee-wee's Playhouse]]''). The entire series was released on [[DVD]] by [[Shout! Factory]] on [[August 15]], [[2006]].

Yankovic has hosted ''[[Al TV]]'' on [[MTV]] and ''Al Music'' on [[MuchMusic]] many times, generally coinciding with the release of each new album. For ''[[Poodle Hat]]'', ''[[Al TV]]'' appeared on [[VH1]] for the first time. A recurring segment of ''[[Al TV]]'' involves Yankovic manipulating interviews for comic effect. He inserts himself into a previously conducted interview with a musician, and then manipulates his questions, resulting in bizarre and comic responses from the celebrity.

[[VH1]] produced a ''[[Behind the Music]]'' episode on Yankovic; however, he was so clean-cut that the producers could not find any of the typical angst-laced problems that make many rock stars' stories compelling (as Yankovic noted in the episode), so they stretched many smaller disappointments and skirmishes during his career into major downfalls to fit the program's classic formula. His two commercial failures (his film ''[[UHF (film)|UHF]]'' and his 1986 album ''[[Polka Party!]]'') were presented as having a larger impact on the direction of his career than they really had. Also, [[Coolio]]'s later disapproval of "[[Amish Paradise]]" was played up as a large feud. Much was also made over his apparent lack of a love life, though he got married shortly after the program aired.<ref name="btm"/>

Yankovic has done voice-overs for a number of animated series. He appeared in a 2003 episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', singing "The Ballad of Homer & Marge" (a parody of [[John Mellencamp]]'s "[[Jack and Diane]]") with his band. The episode, "[[Three Gays of the Condo]]", in which [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] hires Yankovic to sing the aforementioned song to [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] in an attempt to reconcile their marriage, later won an [[Emmy Award]] for "Outstanding Animated Program (For Programming Less Than One Hour)". Yankovic also had a cameo in a 2008 episode, entitled "[[That 90's Show]]", during which he records a parody of Homer's grunge hit "Shave Me" entitled "Brain Freeze" (Homer's song, "Shave Me", was itself a parody of [[Nirvana]]'s "[[Rape Me]]"). Yankovic is the voice for [[List of characters in The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy#Toadblatt.27s Summer School of Sorcery|Squid Hat]] on the [[Cartoon Network (US)|Cartoon Network]] show, ''[[The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy]]''. He is also the announcer of the cartoon's eponymous [[The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy (video game)|video game]] adaptation.  Yankovic had a guest appearance voicing [[Wreck-Gar]], a [[waste collection vehicle]] Transformer in the ''[[Transformers: Animated]]'' cartoon series;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seibertron.com/transformers/news/cartoon-network-to-air-transformers-animated-episo/13008/ |title=Cartoon Network To Air Transformers Animated Episode "Garbage In, Garbage Out"--10:30AM|accessdate=2008-06-15}}</ref> previously, Yankovic's "Dare to Be Stupid" song was featured in the 1986 animated film ''[[The Transformers: The Movie]]'', during the sequence in which the Wreck-Gar character was first introduced; as such, the song is referenced in the episode.

An exhaustive list of television shows on which Yankovic has appeared is available on his official website.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weirdal.com/filmtv.htm |title=Film & TV list|accessdate=2007-07-02}}</ref>

===Directing career===
"Weird Al" Yankovic has directed many of his own [[music video]]s; he has directed all of his music videos from 1993<U+2019>s "[[Bedrock Anthem]]" to his latest, 2006<U+2019>s "[[White & Nerdy]]". He also directed the end sequence of 1986<U+2019>s "[[Christmas at Ground Zero]]" (an original piece juxtaposing [[Christmas]] with [[nuclear warfare]]) from his ''[[Polka Party!]]'' album and the title sequence to ''[[Spy Hard]]'', for which he sang the title song.<ref name="vidfacts">{{cite web|url=http://www.weirdal.com/videtc.htm |title="Weird Al" Yankovic: Video Facts|accessdate=2006-10-26}}</ref> Yankovic will be writing, directing and starring in the short 3-D movie attraction "Al's Brain: A 3-D Journey Through The Human Brain," to premiere at the [[Orange County Fair (California)|Orange County Fair]] in [[Costa Mesa, California]] in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://yankovic.org/blog/2008/07/30/go-into-als-brain/|title=Go Into Al's Brain >> Yank Blog|accessdate=2008-07-31}}</ref>

In addition to his own, he has directed several videos for [[Hanson (band)|Hanson]] (The ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' sequences in "River"), [[The Black Crowes]] ("[[Only a Fool (song)|Only a Fool]]"), [[Ben Folds]] ("[[Rockin' the Suburbs (song)|Rockin' the Suburbs]]"), [[Jeff Foxworthy]] ("Redneck Stomp" and "Party All Night"), [[Blues Explosion]] ("Wail"), and [[The Presidents of the United States of America (band)|The Presidents of the United States of America]] ("Mixed Up S.O.B").<ref name="vidfacts"/> He has cameo appearances in his videos for Blues Explosion, [[Hanson (band)|Hanson]] (as the interviewer), and [[Ben Folds]] (as the producer fixing Folds' "shitty tracks").

==Misattribution and imitators==
[[Image:WeirdAlLimeWire.png|thumb|A screenshot of [[LimeWire]] PRO, showing a large number of parodies misattributed to Yankovic, as well as numerous misspellings of his surname]]
Songs posted to [[file sharing]] networks are often misattributed to him due to their humorous subject matter.  Often, his surname is misspelled (and thus mispronounced) as "Yankovich", among other variations. Much to the disdain of Yankovic, these misattributed files include songs that are racist, sexually explicit, or otherwise offensive. A young listener who had heard several of these offensive tracks by way of a file sharing service confronted Yankovic online, threatening a boycott due to his supposedly explicit lyrics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weirdal.com/aaarchive.htm#100205 |title="Ask Al" Q&As for October 2, 2005|accessdate=2006-08-24}}</ref> Quite a few of the songs, such as "[[Star_Wars_Cantina_%28song%29#Parody_song|Star Wars Cantina]]" by [[Richard Cheese and Lounge Against the Machine|Mark Jonathan Davis]] (later of [[Richard Cheese and Lounge Against the Machine]]), "[[Star Wars Gangsta Rap]]", "Yoda Smokes Weed", "Chewbacca" and several more have a ''[[Star Wars]]'' motif.<ref name="notalpage">{{cite web|url=http://free.house.cx/~eil/etc/notal_list.html |title=The Not Al Page: The most popular songs he didn't even write (or perform)!|accessdate=2006-08-24}}</ref> Some songs misattributed to him are not songs, but spoken skits, such as "[[Sesame Street]] on crack", which is also widely misattributed to [[Adam Sandler]].

Yankovic cites these misattributions as "his only real beef with [[peer-to-peer]] [[file sharing]] sites":
{{cquote|If you do a search for my name on any one of those sites, I guarantee you that about half of the songs that come up will be songs I had absolutely nothing to do with. That particularly bothers me, because I really try to do quality work, and I also try to maintain a more-or-less family-friendly image<U+2014>and some of these songs that are supposedly by me are just, well, vulgar and awful. I truly think my reputation has suffered in a lot of people's minds because of all those fake Weird Al songs floating around the Internet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itworld.com/Tech/2987/060918download |title="Don't not download this song"|accessdate=2006-09-23}}</ref>}}

==Fan-driven campaigns==
The Weird Al Star Fund is a campaign started by Yankovic's fans to get him a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]. Their mission is to "solicit, collect, and raise the necessary money, and to compile the information needed for the application to nominate 'Weird Al' Yankovic for a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]."<ref name="starfund">{{cite web|url=http://www.weirdalstar.com/ |title=The Hollywood Walk of Fame Star Campaign for "Weird Al" Yankovic|accessdate = 2007-03-15}}</ref> Fans worldwide have sent donations to raise the [[United States dollar|US$]]15,000 needed for a nomination. In addition to the preferred method of cash donations, many methods were used to raise money for the cause, such as a live benefit show held [[April 11]], [[2006]], and selling merchandise on the official website and [[eBay]], including T-shirts, calendars, and cookbooks.<ref name="cook">{{cite web|url=http://www.weirdalstar.com/tributeshow.html |title=The Hollywood Walk of Fame Star Campaign for "Weird Al" Yankovic|accessdate = 2006-10-29}}</ref> On [[May 26]], [[2006]], the campaign hit the then-$15,000 target, just five days before the [[May 31]] deadline to submit the necessary paperwork.<ref name="starfund"/> However, Yankovic was not included on the list of inductees for 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/article/index.jsp?uuid=8ce9efb9-2eb5-4f61-85ab-c5c2ffb9d885 |title=Damon, Diddy, Ponch Got Star Power|author=Gina Serpe|publisher=E! Online News|accessdate = 2006-10-29}}</ref> On [[February 9]], [[2007]], the Hollywood Chamber Of Commerce raised the price to sponsor a new star to $25,000<ref name="starfund"/> and as such the Fund is accepting donations again.  Yankovic's application was resubmitted for consideration in 2007, but he was not included among 2008's inductees.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodtoday.net/?p=1129 |title=New Stars to Grace Hollywood Walk of Fame|accessdate = 2007-07-02}}</ref>

Similar to the Weird Al Star Fund, a second fan-driven campaign is the effort to Make the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame|Rock Hall]] "Weird".  Since 2004, Yankovic has been eligible to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in [[Cleveland, Ohio]].<ref name="rockhallgoal">{{cite web|url=http://www.allthingsyank.com/rockhall/goal.htm |title=Make the Rock Hall "Weird" - Our Mission|accessdate=2008-06-15}}</ref>  Previous attempts to raise awareness for the campaign and support Yankovic's nomination included a petition drive from 2006 to 2007, which raised over 9000 signatures; an art competition in 2005; additionally, a documentary film about the campaign is currently being developed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allthingsyank.com/rockhall/faq.htm |title=Make the Rock Hall "Weird" - FAQ|accessdate=2008-06-15}}</ref><ref name="rockhallhelp">{{cite web|url=http://www.allthingsyank.com/rockhall/what.htm |title=Make the Rock Hall "Weird" - How You Can Help|accessdate=2008-06-15}}</ref>  In addition to these efforts, an ongoing campaign is underway in which supporters of Yankovic's nomination are requested to send "sincere, thoughtful" letters to the Rock Hall Foundation's headquarters in New York.<ref name="rockhallhelp"/>.  The Hall has not considered Yankovic for nomination since the campaign started in 2004.<ref name="rockhallgoal"/>
