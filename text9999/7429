[[Marshal of the Royal Air Force]] '''Charles Frederick Algernon Portal, 1st Viscount Portal of Hungerford''' [[Order of the Garter|KG]] [[Order of the Bath|GCB]] [[Order of Merit|OM]] [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO & Bar]] [[Military Cross|MC]] (21 May 1893 <U+2013> 22 April 1971) was a senior [[Royal Air Force]] officer. In the [[World War I|First World War]] he was a pilot, then a flight commander and then a squadron commander flying light bombers on the [[Western Front]]. In the early stages of the [[World War II|Second World War]] he was commander-in-chief of [[RAF Bomber Command|Bomber Command]] in which role he advocated strategic [[Area bombardment|area bombing]] against German industrial areas, the same sort of targets that the [[Luftwaffe]] was already targeting in the United Kingdom. He was then [[Chief of the Air Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of the Air Staff]] during the rest of the War and in that role he fended off an attempt by the [[Royal Navy]] to take over [[RAF Coastal Command]] as well as an attempt by the [[British Army]] to establish their own Army Air Arm. He was also an advocate of the need for a renewed [[strategic bombing]] offensive. In retirement Portal was chairman of [[British Aluminium]] and unsuccessfully fought in the "Aluminium War" against a hostile takeover bid by [[Ivan Stedeford|Sir Ivan Stedeford]]'s [[Tube Investments]]; he then became chairman of the [[British Aircraft Corporation]].

==Early life==
Portal was born at Eddington House, [[Hungerford]], [[Berkshire]], the son of Edward Robert Portal and his wife Ellinor Kate (n<U+00E9>e Hill).<ref name=odnb>{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/31561?docPos=1|title=Portal, Charles Frederick Algernon|publisher=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|accessdate=29 July 2012}}</ref> His younger brother [[Admiral]] Sir Reginald Portal (1894<U+2013>1983) joined the [[Royal Navy]] and also had a distinguished career.<ref name=odnb/> The Portals had [[Huguenot]] origins, having arrived in England in the 17th century.<ref>Richards, pp. 6<U+2013>11.</ref> Charles Portal, or "Peter" as he was nicknamed, was educated at [[Winchester College]] and [[Christ Church, Oxford]].<ref name=odnb/> Portal had intended to become a [[barrister]] but he did not finish his degree and he left undergraduate life to enlist as a private soldier in 1914.<ref name=prob23>Probert, p. 23</ref>

==First World War==
At the beginning of [[World War I|First World War]], Portal joined the [[British Army]] and served as a [[dispatch rider]] in the motorcycle section of the [[Royal Engineers]] on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]].<ref name=air>{{cite web|url=http://www.rafweb.org/Biographies/Portal.htm |publisher=Air of Authority - A History of RAF Organisation |title= Marshal of the Royal Air Force Lord Portal|accessdate=29 July 2012}}</ref> Portal was made a [[corporal]] very soon after joining the Army and he was commissioned as a [[second lieutenant]] only weeks later.<ref name=prob23/>  Around the same time he was commended in [[John French, 1st Earl of Ypres|Sir John French]]'s first despatch of September 1914.<ref name=odnb/> In December 1914 Portal was given command of all riders in the [[I Corps (United Kingdom)|1st Corps]] Headquarters Signals Company.<ref name=odnb/>

In July 1915, with the need for dispatch riders reducing, Portal transferred to the [[Royal Flying Corps]] (RFC).<ref name=air/> He served first as an observer and then, from November 1915, as a flying officer.<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=29563 |startpage=4328 |date=28 April 1916 |supp=yes|accessdate=29 July 2012}}</ref> He graduated as a pilot in April 1916, and joined [[No. 60 Squadron RAF|No. 60 Squadron]] flying [[Morane-Saulnier N|Morane biplanes]] on the [[Western Front]].<ref name=air/> He became a flight commander with [[No. 3 Squadron RAF|No. 3 Squadron]] flying [[Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2|BE2c aircraft]] on the Western Front on 16 July 1916.<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=29691 |startpage=7636 |date=1 August 1916 |supp=yes|accessdate=29 July 2012}}</ref> He was promoted to temporary [[major]] in June 1917<ref name=air/> and given command of [[No. 16 Squadron RAF|No. 16 Squadron]] flying [[Royal Aircraft Factory R.E.8|RE8 aircraft]] on the Western Front at the same time.<ref name=air/> He was promoted to temporary [[lieutenant-colonel]] on 17 June 1918<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=30776 |startpage=7771 |date=2 July 1918 |supp=|accessdate=29 July 2012}}</ref> and given command of No. 24 (Training) Wing at [[RAF Spitalgate|RAF Grantham]] in August 1918.<ref name=air/> He was awarded the [[Military Cross]] in January 1917,<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=29898 |startpage=462 |date=9 January 1917 |supp=|accessdate=29 July 2012}}</ref> the [[Distinguished Service Order]] on 18 July 1917<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=30188 |startpage=7213 |date=17 July 1917 |supp=yes|accessdate=29 July 2012}}</ref> and a [[Medal bar|Bar]] to his DSO on 18 July 1918.<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=30813 |startpage=8739 |date=23 July 1918 |supp=yes|accessdate=29 July 2012}}</ref>

==Inter-war years==
In August 1919 Portal was appointed to a permanent commission in the [[Royal Air Force]] in the rank of [[major]] (shortly afterwards redesignated as a [[squadron leader]]).<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=31486 |date=1 August 1919 |startpage=9865|supp=|accessdate=29 July 2012}}</ref> He became a chief flying instructor at the [[Royal Air Force College Cranwell]] in November 1919 and then attended [[RAF Staff College, Andover|RAF Staff College]] in 1922, before joining the air staff conducting flying operations in the home sector in April 1923.<ref name=air/> Promoted to [[Wing commander (rank)|wing commander]] on 1 July 1925,<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=33063 |startpage=4456 |date=3 July 1925 |supp=|accessdate=29 July 2012}}</ref> he attended the senior officers' war course at the [[Old Royal Naval College#Royal Naval College, Greenwich|Royal Naval College, Greenwich]] in 1926 before taking over [[No. 7 Squadron RAF|No. 7 Squadron]] flying [[Vickers Virginia|Vickers Virginia bombers]] from [[RAF Worthy Down]] in March 1927<ref name=air/> and concentrated on improving bombing accuracy.<ref name=odnb/> He attended the [[Royal College of Defence Studies|Imperial Defence College]] in 1929 and then became Deputy Director of Plans in the Directorate of Operations & Intelligence at the [[Air Ministry]] in December 1930.<ref name=air/> Promoted to [[group captain]] on 1 July 1931,<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=33731 |startpage=4250 |date=30 June 1931 |supp=|accessdate=29 July 2012}}</ref> he was appointed commander of [[British Forces Aden|British forces in Aden]] in February 1934,<ref name=air/> in which role he tried to control the local tribesmen by use of an air blockade.<ref name=odnb/> Promoted to [[air commodore]] on 1 January 1935,<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=34119 |startpage=16 |date=28 December 1934 |supp=yes|accessdate=29 July 2012}}</ref> he joined the Directing Staff at the Imperial Defence College in January 1936.<ref name=air/> He was promoted to [[air vice marshal]] on 1 July 1937<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=34414 |startpage=4253 |date=2 July 1937 |supp=|accessdate=29 July 2012}}</ref> before being appointed Director of Organization at the Air Ministry on 1 September 1937.<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=34432 |startpage=5561 |date=3 September 1937 |supp=|accessdate=29 July 2012}}</ref>

==Second World War==
Appointed a [[Order of the Bath|Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in the 1939 [[New Year Honours]],<ref name=air/> Portal became [[Air Member for Personnel]] on the Air Council on 1 February 1939.<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=34594 |startpage=689 |date=31 January 1939 |supp=|accessdate=29 July 2012}}</ref> He was promoted to the acting rank of [[air marshal]] on 3 September 1939,<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=34742 |startpage=7963 |date=28 November 1939 |supp=|accessdate=29 July 2012}}</ref> appointed commander-in-chief of [[RAF Bomber Command|Bomber Command]] in April 1940<ref name=air/> and promoted to the substantive rank of air marshal on 1 July 1940.<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=34949 |startpage=5579 |date=20 September 1940 |supp=|accessdate=29 July 2012}}</ref> Portal advocated strategic [[Area bombardment|area bombing]] against German industrial areas, the same sort of targets that the [[Luftwaffe]] was already targeting in the United Kingdom.<ref name=prob24>Probert, p. 24</ref> He was advanced to [[Order of the Bath|Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath]] in the 1940 [[Birthday Honours]].<ref name=air/> 

On 25 October 1940, Portal was appointed as [[Chief of the Air Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of the Air Staff]] with the temporary rank of [[air chief marshal]]<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=34989 |startpage=6492 |date=12 November 1940 |supp=yes|accessdate=29 July 2012}}</ref> (made permanent in April 1942).<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=35525 |startpage=1648 |date=14 April 1942 |supp=|accessdate=29 July 2012}}</ref> He continued in this capacity for the remainder of the war.<ref name=air/> The first issue he had to resolve was an attempt by the [[Royal Navy]] to take over [[RAF Coastal Command]] as well as an attempt by the [[British Army]] to establish their own Army Air Arm.<ref name=prob25>Probert, p. 25</ref> Portal successfully persuaded both the Army and the Navy that the RAF could adequately look after their needs.<ref name=prob24/> The second issue Portal had to resolve was the need for a renewed strategic bombing offensive.<ref name=prob24/> In August 1941 he received a report on the relative inefficiency of RAF daytime raids and proposals for area bombing by night: to implement the proposals he determined that a new leader was required and replaced the chief of bomber command, Air Chief Marshal [[Richard Peirse]], with [[Sir Arthur Harris, 1st Baronet|Arthur Harris]].<ref name=prob25/> He was advanced to [[Order of the Bath|Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath]] in the 1942 [[Birthday Honours]].<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=35586 |startpage=2478 |date=5 June 1942 |supp=|accessdate=29 July 2012}}</ref>
[[File:Jalta 1945.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Yalta Conference. Portal is shown standing behind Churchill.]]
Portal accompanied Churchill to all the great conferences and made a good impression on Americans.<ref name=odnb/> In January 1943, at the [[Casablanca Conference]], the [[Combined Chiefs of Staff]] selected him to coordinate the bomber forces of both the United States and Britain in a combined bomber offensive over Germany.<ref name=odnb/> The forces were transferred to U.S. General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] for the duration of [[Operation Overlord|Operation ''Overlord'']];<ref name=odnb/> but when their control reverted to the Combined Chiefs, Portal still advocated area bombing of German cities instead of specific targets.<ref name=spiegel>{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,607524,00.html |title=The Logic Behind the Destruction of Dresden |publisher=Der Spiegel|date=13 February 2009|accessdate=29 July 2012}}</ref> He was promoted to [[Marshal of the Royal Air Force]] on 1 January 1944.<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=36309 |startpage=43 |date=31 December 1943 |supp=yes|accessdate=29 July 2012}}</ref>

In early 1944 Portal's view of strategic bombing changed; he felt that bombers could also play a more auxiliary role in the allied offensive. (Much of what is known about Portal's thinking is based on memoranda he wrote.) He argued for the new approach on the basis of the huge increase in the size of the bomber force, which would carry out not just precision bombing but also indiscriminate [[area bombing]] by night of all German cities with populations exceeding 100,000. Portal thought that the resulting damage to the German war effort and civilian morale would lead to victory within six months. A second memorandum in 1945 made a similar argument.<ref name=spiegel/>

In March 1945 [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]] gave the final order to stop Portal's strategy of [[area bombing]], after the firestorm of [[Dresden]] a few weeks earlier. Churchill subsequently distanced himself from the bombing writing that "the destruction of Dresden remains a serious query against the conduct of Allied Bombing".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/worldwars/wwtwo/area_bombing_01.shtml |title=British Bombing Strategy in World War Two|publisher=BBC|date= 17 February 2011|accessdate=29 July 2012}}</ref>

==Post-war==
In 1945, after the war's end, Portal retired from the RAF and on 12 October 1945 he was raised to the peerage as '''Baron Portal of Hungerford''', of Hungerford in the [[Berkshire|County of Berkshire]], with remainder, failing male issue of his own, to his daughters and their male heirs.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=37305 |date=12 October 1945 |startpage=5026|supp=|accessdate=29 July 2012 }}</ref> On 8 February 1946 he was further honoured when he was made '''Viscount Portal of Hungerford''', of Hungerford in the County of Berkshire, with normal remainder to his heirs male.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=37461 |date=8 February 1946 |startpage=864|supp=|accessdate=29 July 2012}}</ref> He was made a member of the [[Order of Merit]] on 1 January 1946.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=37407 |date=28 December 1945 |startpage=7|supp=|accessdate=29 July 2012}}</ref> He was also awarded the American [[Distinguished Service Medal (United States)|Distinguished Service Medal]] on 15 March 1946<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=37501 |date=12 March 1946 |startpage=1379|supp=yes|accessdate=29 July 2012}}</ref> and appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the Dutch [[Order of Orange-Nassau]] on 18 November 1947.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=38125 |date=14 November 1947 |startpage=5423|supp=yes|accessdate=29 July 2012}}</ref> He was also appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the Belgium [[Order of the Crown (Belgium)|Order of the Crown with Palm]] and awarded the Belgian [[Croix de guerre (Belgium)|Croix de Guerre, 1940, with Palm]] on 27 August 1948.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=38390 |date=27 August 1948 |startpage=4724|supp=|accessdate=29 July 2012}}</ref>

Portal was elected Chairman of [[British Aluminium]] and in 1958/9 he fought in the [[City of London]]'s "Aluminium War" against a hostile takeover bid by [[Ivan Stedeford|Sir Ivan Stedeford]], Chairman and Chief Executive of [[TI Group|Tube Investments]]. T.I. along with its ally [[Reynolds Group Holdings|Reynolds Metals]] of the US, won the takeover battle, and in the process, rewrote the way the City of London conducted its business in relation to shareholders and investors. Stedeford replaced Portal as Chairman of British Aluminium. In 1960 Portal was elected chairman of the [[British Aircraft Corporation]].<ref name=prob26>Probert, p. 26</ref> Portal died from [[cancer]] at his home at [[Funtington|West Ashling]] near near [[Chichester]] on 22 April 1971.<ref name=odnb/>

In July 1919 he married Joan Margaret Welby; they had a son (who died at birth) and two daughters.<ref name=odnb/> The viscountcy died with him but he was succeeded in the barony according to the special remainder by his eldest daughter, Rosemary Ann, who died in 1990.<ref name=odnb/>
