"'''Almost Over'''" is a song preformed by [[Limp Bizkit]] and it's included on the band's fourth album ''[[Results May Vary]]''. 

This song, along with "''Build A Bridge''", was meant to be Limp Bizkit's next single after their second single "''Behind Blue Eyes''." The song was never released as a single after [[Mike Smith (guitarist)|Mike Smith]]'s departure from the band (thus there's no official music video for the song).

The song was written by [[Fred Durst]]. It explains Fred's life events growing up from a child to a adult. It also explains how Fred's life is "one big dream" and doesn't wish to be awake yet because it's "almost over".

==Trivia==
* The song was played live at the "2004 Pepsi Smash".
