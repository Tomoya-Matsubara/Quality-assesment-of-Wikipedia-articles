'''''Alien''''' is a 1979 [[science fiction film|science fiction]]/[[horror film]] directed by [[Ridley Scott]] and starring [[Sigourney Weaver]]. The film's title refers to its primary [[antagonist]]: a highly aggressive [[fictional extraterrestrials|extraterrestrial]] creature which stalks and kills the crew of a [[spacecraft|spaceship]].

''Alien'' garnered both critical acclaim and [[box office]] success, receiving an [[Academy Award for Visual Effects]],<ref name="academy awards database">{{citeweb|title = Awards database|publisher=[[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]]|url = http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/BasicSearchInput.jsp|accessdate = 2008-09-06}}</ref> [[Saturn Award]]s for [[Saturn Award for Best Science Fiction Film|Best Science Fiction Film]], [[Saturn Award for Best Direction|Best Direction]] for Ridley Scott, and [[Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] for [[Veronica Cartwright]],<ref name="past saturn awards">{{citeweb|title = Past Saturn Awards|publisher=The Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy, & Horror Films|url = http://www.saturnawards.org/past.html|accessdate = 2008-09-06}}</ref> and a [[Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation]], along with numerous other award nominations.<ref name="imdb awards">{{cite web|title = Alien (1979) - Awards|publisher = [[Internet Movie Database]]|url = http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078748/awards|accessdate = 2008-09-06}}</ref> It has remained highly praised in subsequent decades, being inducted into the [[National Film Registry]] of the [[Library of Congress]] for historical preservation as a film which is "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"<ref name="national film registry"/><ref name="imdb awards"/><ref name="nfpb about"/> and being ranked by the [[American Film Institute]] as the seventh-best film in the science fiction genre.<ref name="AFI poll"/> It launched a [[media franchise]] of [[novel]]s, [[comic book]]s, [[video game]]s, and [[toy]]s, as well as three [[sequel]] and two [[prequel]] films.

==Plot==
The commercial towing spaceship ''Nostromo'' is on a return trip from Thedus to [[Earth]], hauling a refinery and twenty million tons of mineral [[ore]] and carrying its seven-member crew in [[stasis (fiction)|stasis]]. Upon receiving a mysterious transmission from a nearby [[asteroid|planetoid]], the ship's [[computer]] awakens the crew.<ref>In the script and film the computer is referred to by the crew members as "Mother". An October 1979 issue of ''[[Fantastic Films]]'' magazine, as well as the back of the 1980 Fox videodisk of the film, explain that "Mother" is an abbreviation for "MU/TH/UR 6000", the model of the computer. The chapter list for ''Alien'' in the 2003 ''Alien Quadrilogy'' [[DVD]] set also lists it as "MU/TH/UR". The 1997 sequel ''[[Alien Resurrection]]'', the fourth film in the series, echoed this element by having the crew of the ''Auriga'' refer to the ship's onboard computer as "Father." McIntee, 25, 119.</ref> Acting on orders from their corporate employers, the crew lands the ''Nostromo'' on the planetoid, resulting in some damage to the ship. [[Captain (Land)|Captain]] Dallas ([[Tom Skerritt]]), [[Executive Officer]] Kane ([[John Hurt]]), and [[Navigator]] Lambert ([[Veronica Cartwright]]) set out to investigate the signal's source while [[Warrant Officer]] [[Ellen Ripley|Ripley]] ([[Sigourney Weaver]]), Science Officer Ash ([[Ian Holm]]), and [[Engineer]]s Brett ([[Harry Dean Stanton]]) and Parker ([[Yaphet Kotto]]) stay behind to monitor their progress and make repairs.

Dallas, Kane, and Lambert discover that the signal is coming from a mysterious derelict [[fictional extraterrestrials|alien]] spacecraft. Inside it they find the remains of a large alien creature whose ribs appear to have been bent outward from the inside. Ripley, meanwhile, determines that the mysterious signal is some type of warning. Kane discovers a chamber containing numerous strange [[egg (biology)|eggs]], one of which releases a creature that attaches itself to his face. Dallas and Lambert carry the unconscious Kane back to the ''Nostromo'', where Ash allows them inside against Ripley's orders to follow the ship's [[quarantine]] protocol. They unsuccessfully attempt to remove the creature from Kane's face, discovering that its blood is a powerful [[acid]]. Eventually the creature detaches on its own and is found dead. With the ship repaired, the crew resumes their trip back to Earth.

Kane awakens seemingly unharmed, but during a meal before re-entering stasis he begins to choke and convulse until an alien creature bursts from his chest, killing him and escaping into the ship. Lacking conventional weapons, the crew attempt to locate and capture the creature by fashioning motion trackers, [[taser]]s, and [[flamethrower]]s. Brett follows Jones, the crew's cat, into a large room where the now-fully-grown [[Alien (Alien franchise)|Alien]] attacks him and disappears with his body into the ship's air shafts. Dallas enters the shafts intending to force the Alien into the [[airlock]], but it ambushes him. Lambert implores the remaining crew members to escape in the ship's shuttle, but Ripley, now in command, explains that the shuttle will not support four people.

Accessing the ship's computer, Ripley discovers that Ash has been ordered to return the Alien to the ''Nostromo''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s corporate employers even at the expense of the crew. Ash attacks her, but Parker intervenes and knocks his head off with a [[fire extinguisher]], revealing Ash to be an [[android]]. Before Parker incinerates him, Ash predicts that the other crew members will not survive. The remaining three crew members plan to arm the ''Nostromo'''s self-destruct mechanism and escape in the shuttle, but Parker and Lambert are killed by the Alien while gathering the necessary supplies. Ripley arms the self-destruct sequence and heads for the shuttle with Jones, but finds the Alien blocking her way. She unsuccessfully attempts to abort the self-destruct, then returns to find the Alien gone and escapes in the shuttle as the ''Nostromo'' explodes.

As she prepares to enter stasis Ripley discovers that the Alien is aboard the shuttle. She puts on a [[space suit]] and opens the hatch, causing [[explosive decompression]] which forces the Alien to the open doorway. She shoots it with a [[grappling gun]] which pushes it out, but the gun is caught in the closing door and the Alien is tethered to the shuttle. It attempts to crawl into one of the engines, but Ripley activates them and blasts the Alien into space. The film ends with Ripley and Jones entering stasis for the return trip to Earth.

| style="text-align: right;" | <U+2014> [[Dan O'Bannon]] describing his impetus for writing ''Alien''.<ref name="star beast"/>
|}While studying cinema at the [[University of Southern California]], [[Dan O'Bannon]] had made a [[science fiction]]/[[comedy]] film with director [[John Carpenter]] and [[conceptual art]]ist [[Ron Cobb]] entitled ''[[Dark Star (film)|Dark Star]]'' (1974).<ref name="star beast">"Star Beast: Developing the Story", ''The Beast Within: The Making of Alien''</ref> The film included an [[Fictional extraterrestrials|alien]] which had been created using a [[spray painting|spray-painted]] [[beach ball]], and the experience left O'Bannon "really wanting to do an alien that looked ''real''."<ref name="star beast"/><ref name="McIntee, 20"/> A few years later he began working on a similar story that would focus more on [[horror (film)|horror]]. [[Ronald Shusett]], meanwhile, was working on an early version of what would eventually become ''[[Total Recall]]''.<ref name="star beast"/><ref name="McIntee, 20"/> Impressed by ''Dark Star'', he contacted O'Bannon and the two agreed to collaborate on their projects, choosing to work on O'Bannon's film first as they believed it would be less costly to produce.<ref name="star beast"/><ref name="McIntee, 20"/> O'Bannon had written twenty-nine pages of a script entitled ''Memory'' comprising what would become the film's opening scenes: a crew of astronauts awaken to find that their voyage has been interrupted because they are receiving a signal from a mysterious [[asteroid|planetoid]]. They investigate and their ship breaks down on the surface.<ref name="book of alien"/><ref name="McIntee, 20"/> He did not yet, however, have a clear idea as to what the alien antagonist of the story would be.<ref name="star beast"/>

O'Bannon soon accepted an offer to work on a film adaptation of ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'', a project which took him to [[Paris, France]] for six months.<ref name="star beast"/><ref name="McIntee, 21">McIntee, 21.</ref> Though the project ultimately fell through, it introduced him to several artists whose works gave him ideas for his science fiction story including [[Chris Foss]], [[H.R. Giger]], and [[Jean Giraud|Jean "Moebius" Giraud]].<ref name="book of alien"/> O'Bannon was impressed by Foss' covers for science fiction books, while he found Giger's work "disturbing":<ref name="star beast"/> "His paintings had a profound effect on me. I had never seen anything that was quite as horrible and at the same time as beautiful as his work. And so I ended up writing a script about a Giger monster."<ref name="book of alien"/> After the ''Dune'' project collapsed O'Bannon returned to [[Los Angeles]] to live with Shusett and the two revived his ''Memory'' script. Shusett suggested that O'Bannon use one of his other film ideas, about [[gremlin]]s infiltrating a [[B-17 Flying Fortress|B-17 bomber]] during [[World War II]], and set it on the spaceship as the second half of the story.<ref name="book of alien"/><ref name="McIntee, 21"/> The [[working title]] of the project was now ''Star Beast'', but O'Bannon disliked this and changed it to ''Alien'' after noting the number of times that the word appeared in the story. He and Shusett liked the new title's simplicity and its double meaning as a [[noun]] and [[adjective]].<ref name="star beast"/><ref name="book of alien"/><ref name="McIntee, 21-22">McIntee, 21-22.</ref> Shusett came up with the idea that one of the crew members could be implanted with an alien embryo that would later burst out of him, feeling that this was an interesting [[plot device]] by which the alien creature could get onboard the ship.<ref name="star beast"/><ref name="McIntee, 21"/>

In writing the script O'Bannon drew inspiration from many previous works of science fiction and horror. He has stated that "I didn't steal ''Alien'' from anybody. I stole it from ''everybody''!"<ref name="McIntee, 19">McIntee, 19.</ref> ''[[The Thing from Another World]]'' (1951) inspired the idea of professional men being pursued by a deadly alien creature through a claustrophobic environment.<ref name="McIntee, 19"/> ''[[Forbidden Planet]]'' (1956) gave O'Bannon the idea of a ship being warned not to land, and then the crew being killed one by one by a mysterious creature when they defy the warning.<ref name="McIntee, 19"/> ''[[Planet of the Vampires]]'' (1965) contains a scene in which the heroes discover a giant alien [[skeleton]]; this influenced the ''Nostromo'' crew's discovery of the alien creature in the derelict spacecraft.<ref name="McIntee, 19"/> O'Bannon has also noted the influence of "Junkyard", a short story by [[Clifford D. Simak]] in which a crew lands on an asteroid and discovers a chamber full of eggs.<ref name="McIntee, 20">McIntee, 20.</ref> He has also cited as influences ''Strange Relations'' by [[Philip Jos<U+00E9> Farmer]] (1960), which covers alien reproduction, and [[EC Comics]] horror titles such as ''[[Weird Tales]]'' which carried stories in which monsters eat their way out of people.<ref name="McIntee, 20"/>

With roughly eighty-five percent of the plot completed, Shusett and O'Bannon presented their initial script to several studios,<ref name="star beast"/> pitching it as "''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' in space."<ref name="hays">{{cite web|last=Hays|first =Matthew|title =A space odyssey|work =[[Montreal Mirror]]|date=[[2003-10-23]]|url=http://www.montrealmirror.com/ARCHIVES/2003/102303/film1.html|accessdate =2008-09-06}}</ref> They were on the verge of signing a deal with [[Roger Corman]]'s studio when a friend offered to find them a better deal and passed the script on to [[Walter Hill (director)|Walter Hill]], [[David Giler]], and Gordon Carroll, who had formed a production company called Brandywine with ties to [[20th Century Fox]].<ref name="star beast"/><ref name="McIntee, 24"/> O'Bannon and Shusett signed a deal with Brandywine, but Hill and Giler were not satisfied with the script and made numerous rewrites and revisions to it.<ref name="star beast"/><ref name="McIntee, 25">McIntee, 25.</ref> This caused tension with O'Bannon and Shusett, since Hill and Giler had very little experience with science fiction and according to Shusett: "They weren't good at making it better, or in fact at not making it even worse."<ref name="star beast"/> O'Bannon believed that they were attempting to justify taking his name off of the script and claiming it as their own.<ref name="star beast"/> Hill and Giler did add some substantial elements to the story, however, including the [[android]] character Ash which O'Bannon felt was an unnecessary subplot,<ref name="commentary">{{cite video|people = [[Dan O'Bannon]] (Writer), [[Ridley Scott]] (Director), [[Sigourney Weaver]] (Actor)| title = Alien| medium = DVD (audio commentary track)| publisher = [[20th Century Fox]] Home Entertainment, Inc.| year2 = 2003}}</ref> but which Shusett describes as "one of the best things in the movie...That whole idea and scenario was theirs."<ref name="star beast"/> In total Hill and Giler went through eight different drafts of the script, mostly concentrating on the Ash subplot but also making the dialogue more naturalistic and trimming some sequences set on the alien planetoid.<ref name="McIntee, 26"/>

Despite the multiple rewrites, 20th Century Fox did not express confidence in financing a science fiction film. However, after the success of ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope|Star Wars]]'' in 1977 the studio's interest in the genre rose substantially. According to Carroll: "When ''Star Wars'' came out and was the extraordinary hit that it was, suddenly science fiction became the hot genre." O'Bannon recalls that "They wanted to follow through on ''Star Wars'', and they wanted to follow through fast, and the only spaceship script they had sitting on their desk was ''Alien''".<ref name="star beast"/> ''Alien'' was [[greenlight|greenlit]] by 20th Century Fox at an initial budget of $4.2 million.<ref name="star beast"/><ref name="McIntee, 26"/>

==Direction and design==
O'Bannon had originally assumed that he would direct ''Alien'', but 20th Century Fox instead asked Hill to direct.<ref name="visualists">"The Visualists: Direction and Design", ''The Beast Within: The Making of Alien''</ref><ref name="McIntee, 26">McIntee, 26.</ref> Hill declined due to other film commitments as well as not being comfortable with the level of visual effects that would be required.<ref name="McIntee, 26-27">McIntee, 26-27.</ref> [[Peter Yates]], [[Jack Clayton]], and [[Robert Aldrich]] were considered for the role, but O'Bannon, Shusett, and the Brandywine team felt that these directors would not take the film seriously and would instead treat it as a [[B movie|B monster movie]].<ref name="visualists"/><ref name="McIntee, 27">McIntee, 27.</ref> Giler, Hill, and Carroll had been impressed by [[Ridley Scott]]'s debut feature film ''[[The Duellists]]'' (1977) and made an offer to him to direct ''Alien'', which Scott quickly accepted.<ref name="book of alien"/><ref name="McIntee, 27"/> Scott created detailed [[storyboard]]s for the film in [[London, England|London]], which impressed 20th Century Fox enough to double the film's budget from $4.2 million to $8.4 million.<ref name="visualists"/><ref name="McIntee, 29"/> His storyboards included designs for the spaceship and [[space suit]]s, drawing influences from films such as ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' and ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope|Star Wars]]''.<ref name="McIntee, 29"/> However, he was keen on emphasizing horror in ''Alien'' rather than fantasy, describing the film as "''[[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre]]'' of science fiction".<ref name="visualists"/><ref name="McIntee, 27"/>

[[Image:H.R. Giger - Necronom IV.jpg|200px|thumb|left|[[H.R. Giger]]'s 1976 painting ''Necronom IV'' inspired the design of the Alien.]]O'Bannon introduced Scott to the artwork of [[H.R. Giger]]; both of them felt that his painting ''Necronom IV'' was the type of representation they wanted for the film's antagonist and began asking the studio to hire Giger as a designer.<ref name="visualists"/><ref name="McIntee, 27"/> 20th Century Fox initially believed Giger's work was too ghastly for audiences, but the Brandywine team were persistent and eventually won out.<ref name="McIntee, 27"/> According to Gordon Carroll: "The first second that Ridley saw Giger's work, he knew that the biggest single design problem, maybe the biggest problem in the film, had been solved."<ref name="visualists"/> Scott flew to [[Z<U+00FC>rich]] to meet Giger and recruited him to work on all aspects of the Alien and its environment including the surface of the planetoid, the derelict spacecraft, and all four forms of the Alien from the egg to the adult.<ref name="visualists"/><ref name="McIntee, 27"/>

| style="text-align: left;" | ''I resent films that are so shallow they rely entirely on their visual effects, and of course science fiction films are notorious for this. I've always felt that there's another way to do it: a lot of effort should be expended toward rendering the environment of the spaceship, or space travel, whatever the fantastic setting of your story should be&ndash;as convincingly as possible, but always in the background. That way the story and the characters emerge and ''they'' become more real.''

The final name of the ship was derived from the title of [[Joseph Conrad]]'s 1904 novel ''[[Nostromo]]'', while the escape shuttle ''Narcissus'' was named after Conrad's 1897 [[novella]] ''[[The Nigger of the 'Narcissus']]''.<ref name="McIntee, 15"/> The production team particularly praised Cobb's ability to depict the interior settings of the ship in a realistic and believable manner. Under Ridley Scott's direction the design of the ''Nostromo'' shifted towards and 800-foot-long tug towing a refining platform two miles long and one and a half miles wide.<ref name="book of alien"/> Cobb also created some conceptual drawings of the Alien, but these were not used.<ref name="visualists"/><ref name="McIntee, 28"/> [[Jean Giraud|Moebius]] was attached to the project for a few days as well, and his costume renderings served as the basis for the final space suits created by costume designer John Mollo.<ref name="book of alien"/><ref name="McIntee, 28"/>

==Casting==
{{Details|List of characters in the Alien series|individual characters}}
[[Casting (performing arts)|Casting call]]s and [[audition]]s for ''Alien'' were held in both [[New York City|New York]] and [[London]].<ref name="McIntee, 29"/> With only seven human characters in the story, Scott sought to hire strong actors so that he could focus most of his energy on the film's visual style.<ref name="McIntee, 29"/> He employed casting director Mary Selway, who had worked with him on ''[[The Duellists]]'', to head the casting in the United Kingdom, while Mary Goldberg handled casting in the United States.<ref name="truckers">"Truckers in Space: Casting", ''The Beast Within: The Making of Alien''</ref><ref name="McIntee, 14">McIntee, 14.</ref> In developing the story O'Bannon had focused on writing the Alien first, putting off developing the characters for a later draft.<ref name="visualists"/> He and Shusett had therefore written all of the roles as generic males with a note in the script explicitly stating that "The crew is unisex and all parts are interchangeable for men or women."<ref name="truckers"/><ref name="McIntee, 22">McIntee, 22.</ref> This left Scott, Selway, and Goldberg free to interpret the characters as they liked and to cast accordingly. They wanted the ''Nostromo'''s crew to resemble working astronauts in a realistic environment, a concept summed up as "truckers in space".<ref name="truckers"/><ref name="McIntee, 29"/> Scott has stated that this concept was inspired partly by ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope|Star Wars]]'', which deviated from the pristine future often depicted in science fiction films of the time.<ref>{{cite video| people = [[Ridley Scott|Scott, Ridley]]| date2 = 2004| title = The Force Is With Them: The Legacy of Star Wars| format = ''[[Star Wars]]'' Trilogy| medium = DVD box set, audio commentary track| publisher = [[Lucasfilm Ltd.]] and [[20th Century Fox]] Home Entertainment, Inc| location  = [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]| accessdate = 2008-08-02| quote = Within the context of that fantasy <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[George Lucas]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> said people still have to wash behind their ears at night.

*'''[[Ian Holm]]''' as '''Ash''', the ship's Science Officer who is revealed to be an [[android]] and betrays the crew. Holm was the most experienced actor cast in the film.<ref name="commentary"/>
*'''[[John Hurt]]''' as '''Kane''', the [[Executive Officer]] who becomes the host for the Alien.

*'''[[Tom Skerritt]]''' as '''Dallas''', the Captain of the ''Nostromo''. Skerritt had been approached early in the film's development but declined as it did not yet have a director and had a very low budget.

*'''[[Harry Dean Stanton]]''' as '''Brett''', the Engineering Technician. Stanton's first words to Scott during his audition were "I don't like sci fi or monster movies."<ref name="McIntee, 29"/> Scott was amused and convinced Stanton to take the role after reassuring him that ''Alien'' would actually be a [[thriller (genre)|thriller]] more akin to ''[[And Then There Were None (1974 film)|Ten Little Indians]]''.<ref name="McIntee, 29"/>
*'''[[Sigourney Weaver]]''' as '''[[Ellen Ripley|Ripley]]''', the [[Warrant Officer]] onboard the ''Nostromo'' and chief [[protagonist]] of the film. The decision to make the lead character a woman was made by Giler and Hill, who felt that this would help ''Alien'' stand out in the otherwise male-dominated genre of science fiction.<ref name="truckers"/> Weaver, who had Broadway experience but was relatively unknown in film, impressed Scott, Giler, and Hill with her audition. She was the last actor to be cast for the film, and performed most of her [[screen test]]s in-studio as the sets were being built.<ref name="truckers"/><ref name="McIntee, 30"/> The role of Ripley was Weaver's first leading role in a motion picture, and earned her nominations for a [[Saturn Award for Best Actress]] and a [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] award for Most Promising Newcomer to Leading Film Role.<ref name="imdb awards"/>

To assist the actors in preparing for their roles, Ridley Scott wrote several pages of backstory for each character explaining their histories.<ref name="fear of the unknown">"Fear of the Unknown: Shepperton Studios, 1978", ''The Beast Within: The Making of Alien''</ref><ref name="McIntee, 26"/> He filmed many of their rehearsals in order to capture spontaneity and improvisation, and tensions between some of the cast members, particularly towards the less-experienced Weaver, translated convincingly on film as tension between their respective characters.<ref name="fear of the unknown"/>

[[Film criticism|Film critic]] [[Roger Ebert]] has noted that the actors in ''Alien'' were older than was typical in thriller films at the time, and that this helped make the characters more convincing:
{{cquote|[N]one of them were particularly young. Tom Skerritt, the captain, was 46, Hurt was 39 but looked older, Holm was 48, Harry Dean Stanton was 53, Yaphet Kotto was 42, and only Veronica Cartwright at 29 and Weaver at 30 were in the age range of the usual thriller cast. Many recent action pictures have improbably young actors cast as key roles or sidekicks, but by skewing older, ''Alien'' achieves a certain texture without even making a point of it: These are not adventurers but workers, hired by a company to return 20 million tons of ore to Earth.<ref name="ebert 2003 review"/>}}

[[David A. McIntee|David McIntee]], author of ''Beautiful Monsters: The Unofficial and Unauthorised Guide to the Alien and Predator Films'', has praised the acting and characterizations in ''Alien''. He notes that part of the film's effectiveness in frightening viewers "comes from the fact that the audience can all identify with the characters...Everyone aboard the ''Nostromo'' is a normal, everyday, working Joe just like the rest of us. They just happen to live and work in the future."<ref name="McIntee, 41">McIntee, 41.</ref>

==Set design and filming==
''Alien'' was filmed over fourteen weeks from July 5 to October 21, 1978. Principal photography took place at [[Shepperton Studios]] in [[London, England|London]], while model and miniature filming was done at [[Bray Studios (UK)|Bray Studios]] in [[Water Oakley]].<ref name="McIntee, 14"/> Production time was short due to the film's low budget and pressure from 20th Century Fox to finish on schedule.<ref name="fear of the unknown"/> A crew of over 200 workmen and technicians constructed the three principal sets: The surface of the alien planetoid and the interiors of the ''Nostromo'' and derelict spacecraft.<ref name="book of alien">{{cite book|last = Scanlon|first = Paul|coauthors = Michael Cross|title = The Book of Alien|publisher = [[Titan Books]]|date = 1979|location = [[London]]|isbn = 1-85286-483-4}}</ref> Art Director Les Dilley created 1/24th scale miniatures of the planetoid's surface and derelict spacecraft based on Giger's designs, then made [[molding (process)|moulds]] and [[casting|casts]] and scaled them up as diagrams for the [[wood]] and [[fiberglass]] forms of the sets.<ref name="McIntee, 29">McIntee, 29.</ref> Tons of sand, plaster, fiberglass, rock, and gravel were shipped into the studio to sculpt a desert landscape for the planetoid's surface, which the actors would walk across wearing space suit costumes.<ref name="book of alien"/> The suits themselves were thick, bulky, and lined with [[nylon]], had no cooling systems and, initially, no venting for their exhaled [[carbon dioxide]] to escape.<ref name="McIntee, 33"/> Combined with a [[heatwave]], these conditions nearly caused the actors to pass out and nurses had to be kept on-hand with oxygen tanks to help keep them going.<ref name="fear of the unknown"/><ref name="McIntee, 33">McIntee, 33.</ref> For scenes showing the exterior of the ''Nostromo'' a 58-foot landing leg was constructed to give a sense of the ship's size. Ridley Scott still did not think that it looked large enough, so he had his two sons and the son of one of the cameramen stand in for the regular actors, wearing smaller space suits in order to make the set pieces seem larger.<ref name="darkest reaches">"The Darkest Reaches: Nostromo and Alien Planet", ''The Beast Within: The Making of Alien''</ref><ref name="McIntee, 33"/> The same technique was used for the scene in which the crew members encounter the dead alien creature in the derelict spacecraft. The children nearly collapsed due to the heat of the suits, and eventually oxygen systems were added to assist the actors in breathing.<ref name="fear of the unknown"/><ref name="McIntee, 33"/>

The sets of the ''Nostromo''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s three decks were each created almost entirely in one piece, with each deck occupying a separate stage and the various rooms connected via corridors. To move around the sets the actors had to navigate through the hallways of the ship, adding to the film's sense of [[claustrophobia]] and realism.<ref name="fear of the unknown"/><ref name="book of alien"/><ref name="McIntee, 31"/> The sets used large transistors and low-resolution computer screens to give the ship a "used", industrial look and make it appear as though it was constructed of "retrofitted old technology".<ref name="darkest reaches"/> Ron Cobb created industrial-style symbols and color-coded signs for various areas and aspects of the ship.<ref name="darkest reaches"/> The company that owns the ''Nostromo'' is not named in the film, and is referred to by the characters as "the company". However, the name and logo of "Weylan-Yutani" appears on several set pieces and props such as computer monitors and beer cans.<ref name="McIntee, 15">McIntee, 15.</ref> Cobb created the name to imply a business alliance between [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and Japan, deriving "Weylan" from the [[British Leyland Motor Corporation]] and "Yutani" from the name of his Japanese neighbor.<ref>{{cite book| last = Mollo| first = John| coauthors = [[Ron Cobb]]| title = The Authorized Portfolio of Crew Insignias from the United States Commercial Spaceship Nostromo, Designs and Realizations| quote = I wanted to imply that poor old England is back on its feet and has united with the Japanese, who have taken over the building of spaceships the same way they have now with cars and supertankers.

Changing one letter gave me "Weylan," and "Yutani" was a Japanese neighbor of mine.}}</ref><ref name="McIntee, 28"/> The 1986 sequel ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'' named the company as "Weyland-Yutani",<ref name="aliens">{{cite video| people = [[James Cameron|Cameron, James]] (Director)| title = [[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]| medium = [[DVD]]| publisher = [[20th Century Fox]]| location = [[Beverly Hills, California]]| year2 = 2003}}</ref><ref name="McIntee, 28"/> and it has remained a central aspect of the film franchise.

Art Director [[Roger Christian (filmmaker)|Roger Christian]] used scrap metal and parts to create set pieces and props in order to save money, a technique he had used while working on ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope|Star Wars]]''.<ref name="darkest reaches"/><ref name="McIntee, 31-32">McIntee, 31-32.</ref> Some of the ''Nostromo'''s corridors were created from portions of scrapped bomber aircraft, and a mirror was used to create the illusion of longer corridors in the below-deck area.<ref name="darkest reaches"/> Special effects supervisors Brian Johnson and Nick Allder made many of the set pieces and props actually function, including moving chairs, computer monitors, motion trackers, and [[flamethrower]]s.<ref name="book of alien"/><ref name="McIntee, 32">McIntee, 32.</ref> Four matching cats were used to portray Jones, the ''Nostromo'' crew's pet.<ref name="McIntee, 14"/> During filming Sigourney Weaver discovered that she was [[allergy|allergic]] to the combination of cat hair and the [[glycerol|glycerin]] placed on the actors' skin to make them appear sweaty.

Ridley Scott described the set as the [[cockpit]] or driving deck of the mysterious ship, and the production team was able to convince the studio that the scene was important to impress the audience and make them aware that this was not a [[B movie]].<ref name="darkest reaches"/><ref name="McIntee, 34"/> To save money only one wall of the set was created, and the "space jockey" sat atop a disc that could be rotated to facilitate shots from different angles in relation to the actors.<ref name="book of alien"/><ref name="McIntee, 34"/> Giger [[airbrush]]ed the entire set and the "space jockey" by hand.<ref name="darkest reaches"/><ref name="McIntee, 34"/>

[[Image:Chris Foss Pyramid Book of Alien.JPG|200px|thumb|right|Early concept artwork by [[Chris Foss]] of a pyramid structure in which the Alien eggs were to be housed. This sequence was scrapped due to budgetary and timing concerns, and the egg chamber was moved into the derelict spacecraft.<ref name="book of alien"/>]]The origin of the jockey creature was not explored in the film, but Scott later theorized that it might have been the ship's pilot, and that the ship might have been a weapons carrier capable of dropping Alien eggs onto a planet so that the Aliens could use the local lifeforms as hosts.<ref name="commentary"/> In early versions of the script the eggs were to be located in a separate [[pyramid]] structure which would be found later by the ''Nostromo'' crew and would contain [[statue]]s and [[heiroglyph]]s depicting the Alien reproductive cycle, offering a contrast of the human, Alien, and space jockey cultures.<ref name="McIntee, 21"/> Cobb, Foss, and Giger each created concept artwork for these sequences, but they were eventually discarded due to budgetary concerns and the need to trim the length of the film.<ref name="book of alien"/> Instead the egg chamber was set inside the derelict ship and was filmed on the same set as the space jockey scene; the entire disc piece supporting the jockey and its chair were removed and the set was redressed to create the egg chamber.<ref name="book of alien"/>

''Alien'' originally was to conclude with the destruction of the ''Nostromo'' while Ripley escapes in the shuttle ''Narcissus''. However, Ridley Scott conceived of a "fourth act" to the film in which the Alien appears on the shuttle and Ripley is forced to confront it. He pitched the idea to 20th Century Fox and negotiated an increase in the budget in order to film the scene over several extra days.<ref name="commentary"/><ref name="McIntee, 35"/> Scott had wanted the Alien to bite off Ripley's head and then make the final log entry in her voice, but the producers vetoed this idea as they believed that the Alien had to die at the end of the film.<ref name="McIntee, 35"/>

==Special effects and creature design==
===Spaceships and planets===
[[Image:Alien model filming.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Director [[Ridley Scott]] filming model shots of the ''Nostromo'' and its attached ore refinery. He made slow passes filming at 2<U+00BD> frames per second to give the models the appearance of motion.<ref name="book of alien"/>]]The spaceships and planets for the film were shot using models and miniatures. These included models of the ''Nostromo'', its attached mineral refinery, the escape shuttle ''Narcissus'', the alien [[asteroid|planetoid]], and the exterior and interior of the derelict spacecraft. Visual Effects Supervisor Brian Johnson, supervising modelmaker Martin Bower, and their team worked at [[Bray Studios (UK)|Bray Studios]], roughly thirty miles from [[Shepperton Studios]] where principal filming was taking place.<ref name="outward bound">"Outward Bound: Visual Effects", ''The Beast Within: The Making of Alien''</ref><ref name="McIntee, 36">McIntee, 36</ref> The designs of the ''Nostromo'' and its attachments were based on combinations of Ridley Scott's storyboards and [[Ron Cobb]]'s conceptual drawings.<ref name="outward bound"/> The basic outlines of the models were made of wood and plastic, and most of the fine details were added from [[scale model|model kits]] of [[battleship]]s, [[tank]]s, and [[World War II]] [[bomber]]s. Three models of the ''Nostromo'' were made: a twelve-inch version for medium and long shots, a four-foot version for rear shots, and a twelve-foot, seven-ton rig for the undocking and planetoid surface sequences.<ref name="book of alien"/><ref name="McIntee, 36"/> Scott insisted on numerous changes to the models even as filming was taking place, leading to conflicts with the modeling and filming teams. The ''Nostromo'' was originally yellow, and the team filmed shots of the models for six weeks before Johnson left to work on ''[[Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back|The Empire Strikes Back]]''. Scott then ordered it changed to gray, and the team had to begin shooting again from scratch.<ref name="outward bound"/><ref name="McIntee, 36"/> He ordered more and more pieces added to the model until the final large version with the refinery required a metal framework so that it could be lifted by a [[forklift]]. He also took a hammer and chisel to sections of the refinery, knocking off many of its spires which Bower had spent weeks creating. Scott also had disagreements with lighting technician Denny Ayling over how to light the models.<ref name="outward bound"/>

A separate model, approximately forty feet long, was created for the ''Nostromo'''s underside from which the ''Narcissus'' would detach and from which Kane's body would be launched during the funeral scene. Bower carved Kane's burial [[shroud]] out of wood and it was launched through the hatch using a small [[catapult]] and filmed at high speed, then slowed down in editing.<ref name="outward bound"/><ref name="McIntee, 37">McIntee, 37.</ref> Only one shot was filmed using [[chroma key|blue screen]] compositing: that of the shuttle racing past the ''Nostromo''. The other shots were simply filmed against black backdrops, with stars added via [[multiple exposure|double exposure]].<ref name="McIntee, 36"/> Though [[motion capture]] technology was available at the time, the film's budget would not allow for it. The team therefore used a camera with wide-angles lenses mounted on a drive mechanism to make slow passes over and around the models filming at two and a half frames per second,<ref name="book of alien"/> giving them the appearance of motion. Scott added smoke and wind effects to enhance the illusion.<ref name="outward bound"/> For the scene in which the ''Nostromo'' detaches from the refinery, a thirty-foot docking arm was created using pieces from model railway kits. The ''Nostromo'' was pushed away from the refinery by the forklift, which was covered in black velvet, causing the arm to extend out from the refinery. This created the illusion that the arm was pushing the ship forward.<ref name="outward bound"/><ref name="McIntee, 36"/> Shots from outside the ship in which the characters are seen through windows moving around inside were filmed using larger models which contained projection screens showing pre-recorded footage.<ref name="outward bound"/>

A separate model was created for the exterior of the derelict alien spacecraft. [[Matte (filmmaking)|Matte paintings]] were used to fill in areas of the ship's interior as well as exterior shots of the planetoid's surface.<ref name="outward bound"/> The surface as seen from space during the landing sequence was created by painting a [[globe]] white, then mixing chemicals and dyes onto [[transparency (projection)|transparencies]] and projecting them onto it.<ref name="book of alien"/><ref name="McIntee, 36"/> The planetoid was not named in the film, but some drafts of the script gave it the name [[Acheron]]<ref name="McIntee, 30"/> after the river in [[Greece]] which appears in [[Greek mythology]] as the "stream of woe", a branch of the river [[Styx (mythology)|Styx]], and which forms the border of [[Hell]] in [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s ''[[The Divine Comedy|Inferno]]''. The 1986 sequel ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'' named the planetoid as "LV-426",<ref name="aliens"/> and both names have been used for it in subsequent [[expanded universe]] media such as [[comic book]]s and [[video game]]s. In ''Alien'' the planetoid is located somewhere in the [[Zeta Reticuli|Zeta<sup>2</sup> Reticuli]] system.<ref name="McIntee, 39"/>

===Egg and facehugger===
[[Image:Alien (1979) - Alien egg.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The Alien egg was constructed of [[fiberglass]], and hydraulics were used to open the flaps on its top.<ref name="8th passenger"/>]]The scene of Kane inspecting the egg was shot during post-production. A [[fiberglass]] egg was used so that actor [[John Hurt]] could shine his light on it and see movement inside, which was provided by Ridley Scott fluttering his hands inside the egg while wearing rubber gloves.<ref name="McIntee, 34"/> The top of the egg opened via hydraulics, and the innards were made of a cow's stomach and [[tripe]].<ref name="8th passenger">"The Eighth Passenger: Creature Design", ''The Beast Within: The Making of Alien''</ref><ref name="McIntee, 34"/> Initial test shots of the eggs were filmed using [[chicken|hen]]'s eggs, and this footage was used in early teaser trailers. For this reason a hen's egg was used as the primary image for the film's advertising poster, and became a lasting image for the series as a whole rather than the Alien egg that actually appears in the film.<ref name="McIntee, 34">McIntee, 34.</ref>

[[Image:Alien-The Facehugger.png|thumb|200px|left|The "facehugger" was the first creature Giger designed for the film, giving it humanlike fingers and a long tail.<ref name="8th passenger"/><ref name="McIntee, 31"/>]]The "facehugger" and its [[proboscis]], which was made of a sheep's [[intestine]], were shot out of the egg using high-pressure air hoses. The shot was acted out and filmed in reverse, then reversed and slowed down in editing to prolong the effect and show more detail.<ref name="8th passenger"/><ref name="McIntee, 34"/> The facehugger itself was the first creature that Giger designed for the film, going through several versions in different sizes before deciding on a small creature with humanlike fingers and a long tail.<ref name="8th passenger"/><ref name="McIntee, 31"/> Dan O'Bannon drew his own version based on Giger's design, with help from Ron Cobb, which became the final version.<ref name="commentary"/><ref name="McIntee, 31"/> Cobb came up with the idea that the creature could have a powerful [[acid]] for blood, a characteristic that would carry over to the adult Alien and would make it impossible for the crew to kill it by conventional means such as guns or explosives, since the acid would burn through the ship's hull.<ref name="commentary"/><ref name="McIntee, 21"/> For the scene in which the dead facehugger is examined, Scott used pieces of [[fish]] and [[shellfish]] to create its [[viscus|viscera]].<ref name="8th passenger"/><ref name="McIntee, 34"/>

===Chestburster===
[[Image:Alien-The Chestburster.png|thumb|right|200px|The "chestburster" was shoved up through the table and false torso by a puppeteer.<ref name="8th passenger"/> The scene has been recognized as one of the film's most memorable.]]The design of the "chestburster" was inspired by [[Francis Bacon (painter)|Francis Bacon]]'s 1944 painting ''[[Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion]]''.<ref name="8th passenger"/> Giger's original design resembled a plucked [[chicken]], which was redesigned and refined into the final version seen onscreen.<ref name="8th passenger"/> For the filming of the chestburster scene the cast members knew that the creature would be bursting out of [[John Hurt]], and had seen the chestburster puppet, but they had not been told that fake blood would also be bursting out in every direction from high-pressure pumps and [[squib (explosive)|squibs]].<ref name="McIntee, 32"/> The scene was shot in one take using an artificial torso filled with blood and viscera, with Hurt's head and arms coming up from underneath the table. The chestburster was shoved up through the torso by a puppeteer who held it on a stick. When the creature burst through the chest a stream of blood shot directly at [[Veronica Cartwright]], shocking her enough that she fell over and went into hysterics.<ref name="8th passenger"/><ref name="book of alien"/><ref name="McIntee, 32"/> According to [[Tom Skerritt]]: "What you saw on camera was the real response. She had no idea what the hell happened. All of a sudden this thing just came up."<ref name="8th passenger"/> The creature then runs off-camera, an effect accomplished by cutting a slit in the table for the puppeteer's stick to go through and passing an air hose through the puppet's tail to make it whip about.<ref name="8th passenger"/> The real-life surprise of the actors gave the scene an intense sense of realism and made it one of the film's most memorable moments. During preview screenings the crew noticed that some viewers would move towards the back of the theater so as not to be too close to the screen during the scene.<ref name="McIntee, 40"/> In 2007, the British film magazine ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' named the chestburster scene as the greatest [[History of British film certificates#2002<U+2013> Present|18-rated]] moment in film as part of its "18th birthday" issue, ranking it above the [[decapitation]] scene in ''[[The Omen]]'' (1976) and the transformation sequence in ''[[An American Werewolf in London]]'' (1981).<ref name="empire">{{cite web| title = Alien named as top 18-rated scene| publisher = [[BBC News]]| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6597295.stm| accessdate = 2008-09-07}}</ref>

Ridley Scott had originally wanted the film to be scored by [[Isao Tomita]], but 20th Century Fox wanted a more familiar composer and Goldsmith was recommended by then-President of Fox [[Alan Ladd, Jr.]]<ref name="McIntee, 38"/> Goldsmith wanted to create a sense of romanticism and lyrical mystery in the film's opening scenes, which would build throughout the film to suspense and fear.<ref name="future tense">"Future Tense: Music and Editing", ''The Beast Within: The Making of Alien''</ref> Scott did not like Goldsmith's original main title piece, however, so Goldsmith rewrote it as "the obvious thing: weird and strange, and which everybody loved."<ref name="future tense"/><ref name="McIntee, 38"/> Another source of tension was editor [[Terry Rawlings]]' choice to use pieces of Goldsmith's music from previous films, including a piece from ''[[Freud the Secret Passion]]'', and to use a piece by [[Howard Hansen]] for the end credits.<ref name="future tense"/><ref name="McIntee, 38"/> Scott and Rawlings had also become attached to several of the musical cues they had used for the temporary score while editing the film, and re-edited some of Goldsmith's cues and re-scored several sequences to match these cues and even left the temporary score in place in some parts of the finished film.<ref name="future tense"/> Goldsmith later remarked that "you can see that I was sort of like going at opposite ends of the pole with the filmmakers of the picture."<ref name="future tense"/> Nevertheless, Scott praised Goldsmith's score as "full of dark beauty"<ref name="McIntee, 38"/> and "seriously threating, but beautiful."<ref name="future tense"/> It was nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score]], a [[Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack Album for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media|Grammy Award for Best Soundtrack Album]], and a [[BAFTA Award for Best Film Music]]<ref name="imdb awards"/> The score has been released as a [[soundtrack album]] in several versions with different tracks and sequences.<ref name="McIntee, 38-39"/>

==Editing==
Editing and post-production work on ''Alien'' took roughly twenty weeks to complete.<ref name="future tense"/> [[Terry Rawlings]] served as Editor, having previously worked with Scott on editing sound for ''[[The Duellists]]''.<ref name="future tense"/> Scott and Rawlings edited much of the film to have a slow pace in order to build suspense for the more tense and frightening moments. According to Rawlings: "I think the way we did get it right was by keeping it slow, funny enough, which is completely different from what they do today. And I think the slowness of it made the moments that you wanted people to be sort of scared...then we could go as fast as we liked because you've sucked people into a corner and then attacked them, so to speak. And I think that's how it worked."<ref name="future tense"/> The first cut of the film was over three hours long; further editing trimmed the final version to just under two hours.<ref name="future tense"/><ref name="McIntee, 40"/>

[[Image:Alien (1979) - cocoon scene.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A scene of Ripley discovering Dallas and Brett [[pupa#cocoon|cocoon]]ed during her escape was cut because it disrupted the film's pacing.

Her trying to get the hell out of there, we're all rooting for her to get out of there, and for her to slow up and have a conversation with Dallas was not appropriate."<ref name="future tense"/> The footage was included amongst other deleted scenes as a special feature on the [[Laserdisc]] release of ''Alien'', and a shortened version of it was re-inserted into the 2003 "Director's Cut" which was re-released in theaters and on [[DVD]].<ref name="director's cut">{{cite video| date2 = 2003-12-02| title = Alien (Director's Cut)| format = ''[[Alien Quadrilogy]]'', disc 1| medium = DVD| publisher = [[20th Century Fox]] Home Entertainment, Inc| location = [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]}}</ref><ref name="McIntee, 24"/>

==Sequels==
{{details|Alien (franchise)}}
The success of ''Alien'' led [[20th Century Fox]] to finance three direct [[sequel]]s over the next eighteen years, each by different writers and directors. [[Sigourney Weaver]] remained the only recurring actor through all four films, and the story of her character [[Ellen Ripley|Ripley]]'s encounters with the [[Alien (Alien franchise)|Aliens]] became the thematic thread running through the series.<ref name="ebert 2003 review"/> [[James Cameron]]'s ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'' (1986) focused more on action and involved Ripley returning to the planetoid accompanied by [[marine (military)|marines]] to confront hordes of Aliens.<ref name="aliens"/> [[David Fincher]]'s ''[[Alien 3]]'' (1992) had [[nihilism|nihilistic]] tones<ref name="McIntee, 41"/> and found her on a prison planet battling another Alien, ultimately sacrificing herself to prevent her employers from acquiring the creatures.<ref name="alien 3">{{cite video| people = [[David Fincher|Fincher, David]] (Director)| title = [[Alien 3]]| medium = [[DVD]]| publisher = [[20th Century Fox]]| location = [[Beverly Hills, California]]| year2 = 2003}}</ref> [[Jean-Pierre Jeunet]]'s ''[[Alien Resurrection]]'' (1997) saw Ripley resurrected through [[cloning]] to battle  more Aliens even further in the future.<ref name="alien resurrection">{{cite video| people = [[Jean-Pierre Jeunet|Jeunet, Jean-Pierre]] (Director)| title = [[Alien Resurrection]]| medium = [[DVD]]| publisher = [[20th Century Fox]]| location = [[Beverly Hills, California]]| year2 = 2003}}</ref>

The success of the film series resulted in the creation of a [[media franchise]] with numerous [[novel]]s, [[comic book]]s, [[video game]]s, [[toy]]s, and other media and merchandise appearing over the years. A number of these began appearing under the ''[[Alien vs. Predator]]'' [[fictional crossover|crossover]] imprint, which brought the Alien creatures together with the [[Predator (alien)|Predators]] of the [[Predator (franchise)|''Predator'' franchise]]. The film series soon followed suit, with [[Paul W. S. Anderson]]'s [[Alien vs. Predator (film)|''Alien vs. Predator'']] (2004) and [[Brothers Strause|Colin and Greg Strause]]'s ''[[Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem]]'' (2007) abandoning the Ripley character in favor of [[prequel]] stories set in the [[present day]].<ref name="avp">{{cite video| people = [[Paul W.

Despite not appearing in either prequel, Sigourney Weaver has expressed interest in reuniting with [[Ridley Scott]] to revive her character for another ''Alien'' sequel. In the 2003 commentary track for the ''Alien'' DVD included in the ''Alien Quadrilogy'' set, she and Scott both speculated on the possibility, with Weaver stating: "There is an appetite for a fifth one, which is something I never expected...it's really hard to come up with a fifth story that's new and fresh...but I have wanted to go back into space...I think outer space adventure is a good thing for us right now, 'cause Earth is so grim...so we've been talking about it, but very generally."<ref name="commentary"/> Scott remarked that, if the series were to continue, the most logical course would be to explore the origins of the space jockey and the Aliens.<ref>{{cite video|people = [[Ridley Scott]] (Director)| title = Alien| medium = DVD (audio commentary track)| publisher = [[20th Century Fox]] Home Entertainment, Inc.| year2 = 2003| quote = It's a tough one, particularly with the success of four. I think if you close the lid it should be the end of the first chapter, and I think very simply what no one's done is simply gone back to re-visit 'what was it?' No one's ever said 'who's the space jockey?' He wasn't an Alien. What was that battleship? Is it a battleship? Is it an aircraft carrier? Is it a bio-mechanoid weapon carrier?...Why did it land? Did it crash-land, or did it settle there because it had engine trouble?...And how long ago? 'Cause those eggs would sit there.}}</ref> Weaver supported this idea, stating that "I think it would be great to go back, because I'm asked that question so many times: 'Where did the Alien come from?' People really want to know in a very visceral way."<ref name="commentary"/> [[David Giler]] has said that he, [[Walter Hill (director)|Walter Hill]], and Gordon Carroll, the producers of the first five films in the series, would not be willing to produce another sequel unless it was about the Aliens' homeworld and Weaver was on board. Weaver, in turn, has said that she would only return to the franchise if either Ridley Scott or [[James Cameron]] were directing.<ref name="McIntee, 264">McIntee, 264.</ref> Cameron had been working on a story for a fifth ''Alien'' film which would explore the origins of the creatures, but ceased work on it when he learned that Fox was pursuing ''Alien vs. Predator'', which he felt would "kill the validity of the franchise".<ref name="vespe">{{cite web|last=Vespe|first =Eric "Quint"|title =Holy Crap!

| style="text-align: left;" | ''The traditional definition of the term "Director's Cut" suggests the restoration of a director's original vision, free of any creative limitations. It suggests that the filmmaker has finally overcome the interference of heavy-handed studio executives, and that the film has been restored to its original, untampered form. Such is not the case with ''Alien'': The Director's Cut. It's a completely different beast.''

|}In 2003, [[20th Century Fox]] was preparing the ''Alien Quadrilogy'' [[DVD]] box set, which would include ''Alien'' and its three sequels. In addition, the set would also include alternate versions of all four films in the form of "special editions" and "[[director's cut]]s". Fox approached Ridley Scott to digitally restore and [[remaster]] the original ''Alien'', and to restore several scenes which had been cut during the editing process for inclusion in an expanded version of the film.<ref name="quadrilogy">{{cite video| people = [[Ridley Scott]] ([[Film director|Director]])| date2 = 2003-12-02| title = [[Alien Quadrilogy]]|medium = DVD booklet| publisher = [[20th Century Fox]] Home Entertainment, Inc| location = [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]}}</ref> Upon viewing the expanded version, Scott felt that it was too long and chose to recut it into a more streamlined alternate version:<ref name="quadrilogy"/>
{{cquote|Upon viewing the proposed expanded version of the film, I felt that the cut was simply too long and the pacing completely thrown off. After all, I cut those scenes out for a reason back in 1979. However, in the interest of giving the fans a new experience with ''Alien'', I figured there had to be an appropriate middle ground. I chose to go in and recut that proposed long version into a more streamlined and polished alternate version of the film. For marketing purposes, this version is being called "The Director's Cut."}}
The "Director's Cut" restored roughly four minutes of deleted footage while cutting about five minutes of other material, leaving it actually about a minute shorter than the theatrical cut.<ref name="McIntee, 40">McIntee, 40.</ref> Many of the changes were minor, such as altered sound effects, while the restored footage included the scene in which Ripley discovers the cocooned Dallas and Brett during her escape of the ''Nostromo''. Fox decided to release the Director's Cut in theaters, and it premiered on October 31, 2003.<ref name="McIntee, 40"/> The ''Alien Quadrilogy'' box set was released on December 2, 2003 with both versions of the film included along with a new commentary track featuring many of the film's actors, writers, and production staff, as well as other special features and a documentary entitled ''The Beast Within: The Making of Alien''. Each film was also released singly as a DVD with both versions of the film included. Scott noted that he was very pleased with the original theatrical cut of ''Alien'', saying that "For all intents and purposes, I felt that the original cut of ''Alien'' was perfect. I still feel that way", and that the original 1979 theatrical version "remains my version of choice".<ref name="quadrilogy"/> He has since stated that he considers both versions "director's cuts", as he feels that the 1979 version was the best he could possibly have made it at the time.<ref name="quadrilogy"/>

The ''Alien Quadrilogy'' set earned ''Alien'' a number of new awards and nominations. It won DVDX Exclusive Awards for Best Audio Commentary and Best Overall DVD, Classic Movie, and was also nominated for Best Behind-the-Scenes Program and Best Menu Design.<ref name="imdb awards"/> It also won a Sierra Award for Best DVD, and was nominated for a [[Saturn Award]] for Best DVD Collection and Golden [[Satellite Award]]s for Best DVD Extras and Best Overall DVD.<ref name="imdb awards"/>

===Imitations===
''Alien'' had both an immediate and long-term impact on the science fiction and horror genres. Shortly after its debut [[Dan O'Bannon]] was sued by another writer named Jack Hammer for allegedly plagiarising a script entitled ''Black Space''. However, O'Bannon was able to prove that he had written his ''Alien'' script first.<ref name="McIntee, 40-41">McIntee, 40-41.</ref> In the wake of ''Alien''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s success a number of other filmmakers imitated or adapted some of its elements, sometimes by copying its title. One of the first was ''The Alien Dead'' (1979), which was titled at the last minute to cash in on ''Alien''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s popularity.<ref name="McIntee, 262">McIntee, 262.</ref> ''[[Contamination (film)|Contamination]]'' (1980) was initially going to be titled ''Alien 2'' until 20th Century Fox's lawyers contacted writer/director [[Luigi Cozzi]] and made him change it, and it built on press coverage of ''Alien''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s chestburster scene by having many similar creatures, which originated from large, slimy eggs, bursting from characters' chests.<ref name="McIntee, 262"/> An unauthorized Italian sequel to ''Alien'', titled ''[[Alien 2]]'', was released in 1980 and included alien creatures which incubate inside human hosts. Other science fiction films of the time that exploited elements of ''Alien'' included ''[[Inseminoid]]'' (1981) and ''[[Xtro]]'' (1982).<ref name="McIntee, 262"/> ''Alien''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s influence also extended into [[video game]]s, as the development team working on ''[[Metroid]]'' (1986) acknowledged that they were inspired by the film's atmosphere and elements of science fiction adventure, and named the [[boss (video game)|boss character]] Ridley after Ridley Scott.<ref name="metroid">{{cite web|last = Robinson|first = Andy|title = The History of Metroid - Part One|publisher = CVG Beta|date = 2007-10-15|url = http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=173735|accessdate = 2008-09-21}}</ref><ref name="ridley">{{cite web|title = Character Biography: Ridley|publisher = TWG|date = 2008-08-15|url = http://twgnews.com/2008/08/15/character-biography-ridley/|accessdate = 2008-09-21}}</ref>

===Antecedents===
In the decades since its original release critics have analyzed and acknowledged ''Alien''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s roots in earlier works of fiction. It has been noted as sharing thematic similarities with earlier science fiction films such as ''[[The Thing from Another World]]'' (1951)<ref name="ebert 2003 review"/><ref name="french">{{cite web|last = French|first = Philip|title = Alien (review)|publisher = ''[[The Guardian]]''|date = 2003-11-02|url = http://film.guardian.co.uk/News_Story/Critic_Review/Observer_review/0,,1075900,00.html|accessdate = 2008-07-15}}</ref> and ''[[It! The Terror from Beyond Space]]'' (1958),<ref name="mackinder review"/><ref name="McIntee, 19"/> as well as a kinship with other 1970s horror films such as ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' (1975) and ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'' (1978).<ref name="ebert 2003 review"/> Literary connections have also been suggested, including thematic comparisons to ''[[And Then There Were None]]'' (1939).<ref name="french"/> Many critics have also suggested that the film derives in part from [[A. E. van Vogt]]'s ''[[The Voyage of the Space Beagle]]'' (1950), particularly the stories ''The Black Destroyer'', in which a cat-like alien infiltrates the ship and hunts the crew, and ''Discord in Scarlet'', in which an alien implants parasitic eggs inside crew members which then hatch and eat their way out (both stories had originally been published in issues of [[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|''Astounding Science Fiction'']] magazine in 1939).<ref>McIntee, 19-20.</ref> O'Bannon, however, denies that this was a source of his inspiration for ''Alien''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s story.<ref name="McIntee, 20"/> Van Vogt actually initiated a lawsuit against [[20th Century Fox]] over the similarities, but Fox settled out of court.<ref>{{cite web|title = The Voyage of the Space Beagle|work = My Science Fiction Life|publisher = [[BBC]]|url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/mysciencefictionlife/A20258336|accessdate = 2008-08-02}}</ref> Writer [[David A. McIntee|David McIntee]] also notes similarities to the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episode "[[The Ark in Space]]" (1975), in which an insectoid queen alien lays [[larva]]e inside humans which later eat their way out, a life cycle inspired by that of the [[Ichneumonoidea|ichneumons wasp]].<ref name="McIntee, 20"/> He has also noted similarities between the first half of the film, particularly in early versions of the script, to [[H.P. Lovecraft]]'s ''[[At the Mountains of Madness]]'', "not in storyline, but in dread-building mystery",<ref name="McIntee, 20">McIntee, 23.</ref> and calls the finished film "the best Lovecraftian movie ever made, without being a Lovecraft adaptation", due to its similarities in tone and atmosphere to Lovecraft's works.<ref name="McIntee, 41"/>

===Lasting critical praise===
''Alien'' has continued to receive critical praise over the years, particularly for its realism and unique environment.<ref name="mackinder review"/> It has a 97% approval rating at the online [[review aggregator]] [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 71 reviews,<ref name="rotten tomatoes">{{cite web| title = Alien (1979)| publisher = [[Rotten Tomatoes]]| url = http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/alien/| accessdate = 2008-09-08}}</ref> while [[Metacritic]] gives the Director's Cut an 83% approval rating based on 22 reviews.<ref name="metacritic">{{cite web| title = Alien: The Director's Cut| publisher = [[Metacritic]]| url = http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/alien?q=alien| accessdate = 2008-09-08}}</ref> Critical interest in the film was re-ignited in part by the theatrical release the "Director's Cut" in 2003. In his "Great Movies" column that year, critic [[Roger Ebert]] ranked it among "the most influential of modern action pictures", praising its pacing, atmosphere, and settings:

{{cquote|One of the great strengths of ''Alien'' is its pacing. It takes its time. It waits. It allows silences (the majestic opening shots are underscored by [[Jerry Goldsmith]] with scarcely audible, far-off metallic chatterings). It suggests the enormity of the crew's discovery by building up to it with small steps: The interception of a signal (is it a warning or an [[SOS]]?). The descent to the extraterrestrial surface. The bitching by Brett and Parker, who are concerned only about collecting their shares. The masterstroke of the surface murk through which the crew members move, their helmet lights hardly penetrating the soup. The shadowy outline of the alien ship. The sight of the alien pilot, frozen in his command chair. The enormity of the discovery inside the ship ("It's full of ... leathery eggs ...").<ref name="ebert 2003 review"/>}}

McIntee praises ''Alien'' as "possibly the definitive combination of horror thriller with [science fiction] trappings."<ref name="McIntee, 41"/> He notes, however, that it is a horror film first and a science fiction film second, since science fiction normally explores issues of how humanity will develop under other circumstances. ''Alien'', on the other hand, focuses on the plight of people being attacked by a monster: "It's set on a spaceship in the future, but it's about people trying not to get eaten by a drooling monstrous animal. Worse, it's about them trying not to get raped by said drooling monstrous animal."<ref name="McIntee, 41"/> Along with ''Halloween'' and ''[[Friday the 13th (1980 film)|Friday the 13th]]'' (1980), he describes it as a prototype for the [[slasher film]] genre: "The reason it's such a good movie, and wowed both the critics, who normally frown on the genre, and the casual cinema-goer, is that it is a distillation of everything that scares us in the movies."<ref name="McIntee, 41"/> He also describes how the film appeals to a variety of audiences: "Fans of [[Alfred Hitchcock|Hitchcockian]] thrillers like it because it's moody and dark. Gorehounds like it for the chest-burster. [Science fiction] fans love the hard [science fiction] trappings and hardware. Men love the battle-for-survival element, and women love not being cast as the helpless victim."<ref name="McIntee, 42">McIntee, 42.</ref>

|}[[Salon.com]] critic Andrew O'Hehir notes that ''Alien'' "has a profoundly [[existentialism|existentialist]] undertow that makes it feel like a [[film noir]]"<ref name="o'hehir">{{cite web| last = O'Hehir| first = Andrew| title = The horror, the horror| publisher = [[Salon.com]]| date = 2003-11-01| url = http://dir.salon.com/story/ent/movies/review/2003/11/01/alien/index.html?CP=IMD&DN=110| accessdate = 2008-09-06}}</ref> and praises it over its "increasingly [[baroque]]" sequels as "a film about human loneliness amid the emptiness and [[amorality]] of creation. It's a cynical '70s-[[Left-wing politics|leftist]] vision of the future in which none of the problems plaguing 20th century Earth <U+2014> class divisions, [[capitalism|capitalist]] exploitation, the subjugation of humanity to technology <U+2014> have been improved in the slightest by mankind's forays into outer space."<ref name="o'hehir"/>

In 2002, ''Alien'' was deemed "culturally, historically or aesthetically significant" by the [[National Film Preservation Board]] of the United States,<ref name="nfpb about">{{cite web| title = National Film Preservation Board| publisher = [[National Film Preservation Board]]| url = http://www.loc.gov/film/filmabou.html| accessdate = 2008-09-06}}</ref> and was inducted into the [[National Film Registry]] of the [[Library of Congress]] for historical preservation alongside other films of 1979 including ''[[All That Jazz]]'', ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'', ''[[The Black Stallion (film)|The Black Stallion]]'', and ''[[Manhattan (film)|Manhattan]]''.<ref name="national film registry">{{cite web| title = Films Selected to the National Film Registry, Library of Congress, 1989-2007| publisher = [[National Film Registry]]| url = http://www.loc.gov/film/titles.html| accessdate = 2008-09-06}}</ref> In 2008 the [[American Film Institute]] ranked ''Alien'' as the seventh-best film in the science fiction genre as part of ''AFI's 10 TOP 10'', a [[CBS]] television special ranking the ten greatest movies in ten classic American film genres. The ranks were based on a [[opinion poll|poll]] of over 1,500 film artists, critics, and historians, with ''Alien'' ranking just above ''[[Terminator 2: Judgement Day]]'' (1991) and just below Ridley Scott's other science fiction film ''[[Blade Runner]]'' (1982).<ref name="AFI poll">{{cite web| title = AFI Crowns Top 10 Films in 10 Classic Genres| publisher = ComingSoon.net| url = http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=46072| accessdate = 2008-09-07}}</ref>

===Sexual imagery===
''Alien''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s sexual overtones have also been analyzed, with the facehugger's attack on Kane being compared to a male [[rape]] and the chestburster scene to a form of violent [[birth]], while the Alien's [[phallus|phallic]] head and method of killing the crew members add to the sexual imagery.<ref name="mackinder review"/> McIntee claims that "''Alien'' is a rape movie as much as ''[[Straw Dogs]]'' [(1974)] or ''[[I Spit on Your Grave]]'' (1978), or ''[[The Accused (1988 film)|The Accused]]'' (1988). On one level it's about an intriguing alien threat. On one level it's about [[parasitism]] and disease. And on the level that was most important to the writers and director, it's about sex, and reproduction by non-consensual means. And it's about this happening to a man."<ref name="McIntee, 43">McIntee, 43.</ref> He notes how the film plays on men's fear and misunderstanding of pregnancy and childbirth, while also giving women a glimpse into these fears.<ref name="McIntee, 43-44">McIntee, 43-44.</ref> Film analyst Lina Badley has written that the Alien's design, with strong [[Sigmund Freud|Freudian]] sexual undertones, multiple phallic symbols, and overall feminine figure, provides an [[androgyny|androgynous]] image conforming to [[archetype|archetypal]] mappings and imageries in horror films that often redraw gender lines.<ref name="badley">{{cite book|last = Badley|first = Lina|title = Film, Horror, and the Body Fantastic: Contributions to the Study of Popular Culture|publisher = [[Greenwood Press]]|date = 1995|location = [[Westport, Connecticut]]|isbn = 978-0313275234}}</ref>
