The ''Orkneyinga saga'' was compiled in about 1200, and documents the reigns of the [[earls of Orkney]]. It depicts Lj<U+00F3>t<U+00F3>lfr as a [[nobleman]] who lived on the [[Outer Hebridean]] island of [[Lewis]]. During the 12th century, the [[Hebrides]] formed part of the [[Kingdom of Mann and the Isles]].

The ''Orkneyinga saga'' relates how Lj<U+00F3>t<U+00F3>lfr was a friendly acquaintance of the [[Viking]] chieftain [[Sweyn Asleifsson|Sveinn <U+00C1>sleifarson]], who is one of the major characters of the entire saga. The saga states that Lj<U+00F3>t<U+00F3>lfr housed Sveinn for some time on Lewis, and took in Sveinn's brother, who was [[exile|banished]] from [[Orkney]]. Lj<U+00F3>t<U+00F3>lfr's son, Fugl, appears in the saga, although he is depicted at being at odds with Sveinn, until a relative of Fugl's negotiates peace between the two. Several historians have considered Lj<U+00F3>t<U+00F3>lfr to be an ancestor of [[Clan MacLeod]]; one of these considered Lj<U+00F3>t<U+00F3>lfr to be the [[eponymous]] ancestor of the clan&mdash;although the current understanding of the clan's ancestry regards another man as the eponym.

==Background==

Lj<U+00F3>t<U+00F3>lfr is a minor character in the ''[[Orkneyinga saga]]''. He is purported to have flourished in the mid-12th century, and to have lived on the [[Outer Hebridean]] island of [[Lewis]]. Lj<U+00F3>t<U+00F3>lfr has a son, Fugl, another minor character in the saga, who is also described as being from the island.{{#tag:ref|According to Aslak Liest<U+00F8>l in 1983, the name ''Fugl'', in a West Norse context, is only found in this character, and in a [[runic inscription]] found in 1962 on the Inner Hebridean island of [[Iona]].<ref name="L1-8594">[[#L1|Liest<U+00F8>l 1983]]: pp. 85<U+2013>94.</ref> This inscription has been dated to the late 10th century, or 11th century.<ref name="canmore2">{{cite web |url=http://canmore.rcahms.gov.uk/en/site/129125/details/iona+iona+abbey+museum/ |title=Iona, Iona Abbey Museum |work=[[CANMORE]] |accessdate=1 April 2010 }}</ref> The name is also known in [[History of Anglo-Saxon England|pre-Conquest England]], and in mediaeval Danish and Swedish sources.<ref name="L1-8594"/> The name originated as a [[byname]] derived from the [[Old West Norse]] ''fugl'', which means "[[fowl]]", "[[bird]]".<ref name="ONMensNames"/> Historian [[Alan Orr Anderson]] noted in 1922, that the mediaeval ''[[Chronicle of Man]]'' records for the year 1183: "Fogolt, the [[sheriff]] of Man, died".

===Sources===

The main source for Lj<U+00F3>t<U+00F3>lfr is the ''Orkneyinga saga'', which was compiled sometime around 1200 by an unknown [[Icelandic people|Icelander]]. The saga is thought to have been based upon poetry, [[oral tradition]], and other written material. It can be summed up as an account of the lives of many of the [[earls of Orkney]] between the 9th and 13th centuries. According to [[research fellow]] Ian Beuermann, the saga is useful not for the specific events it describes, but rather for what it reveals about "the ideas shaping the texts during the periods of composition or revision". For example, it is possible that even one of the main characters of the saga, [[Sweyn Asleifsson|Sveinn <U+00C1>sleifarson]], never existed, or at least that the historical Sveinn differed from the saga's portrayal of him.<ref name="Beuermann">{{cite web |url=http://www.cas.uio.no/Publications/Seminar/Confluence_Beuermann.pdf |format=[[pdf]] |title=A Chieftain in an Old Norse Text: Sveinn <U+00C1>sleifarson and the Message behind Orkneyinga Saga |author=Beuermann, Ian |date= |publisher=Centre for Advanced Study at the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters (www.cas.uio.no) |accessdate=21 March 2010}}</ref> Another source which mentions Lj<U+00F3>t<U+00F3>lfr is [[<U+00DE>orm<U+00F3><U+00F0>ur Torfason]]'s 17th-century [[Latin]] history of Orkney, which follows the ''Orkneyinga saga''.

In the 11th century, the earls of Orkney were at the height of their power. The Earl of Orkney, [[Thorfinn the Mighty|<U+00DE><U+00F3>rfinnr Sigur<U+00F0>arson]], also ruled [[Caithness]] and [[Sutherland]], and seems to have controlled the western seaboard of Scotland, and the [[Hebrides]].<ref>[[#H4|Stef<U+00E1>nsson 2003]]: p. 205.</ref> Historian Magn<U+00FA>s Stef<U+00E1>nsson described the political situation of the Hebrides and the Isle of Man during the 11th and early 12th century as being unstable, and suffering from the rivalries of [[petty king]]s and chieftains.<ref name="H4-207">[[#H4|Stef<U+00E1>nsson 2003]]: p. 207.</ref> In 1079, the Hebridean warlord [[Godred Crovan|Gofraidh Crobh<U+00E1>n]] was able to unite the Hebrides and the Isle of Man into an effective independent kingdom.<ref name="H2-128132">[[#H2|Haywood 1995]]: pp. 128&ndash;132.</ref> In 1098&ndash;9, the Norwegian king [[Magnus III of Norway|Magn<U+00FA>s <U+00D3>l<U+00E1>fsson]] invaded the Hebrides, and asserted his right over the islands; he did so again in 1102&ndash;3. He is thought to have planned to unite Orkney, the Hebrides, and the Isle of Mann, under the control of [[Sigurd I of Norway|his son]].<ref name="H4-207"/> In 1103, Magn<U+00FA>s was slain in Ireland, and no [[King of Norway|Norwegian king]] set foot in the islands for over a century and a half.<ref>[[#O1|Woolf 2004]]: p. 101.</ref> With Magn<U+00FA>s' death, the Outer Hebrides were brought back under the control of the [[Kingdom of Mann and the Isles]],<ref>[[#O1|Woolf 2004]]: p. 103.</ref> whose kings tactfully recognised Norwegian sovereignty.<ref name="H2-128132"/> In 1156, the kingdom was partitioned following an inconclusive sea battle between the warlord [[Somerled|Somhairle mac Gille Brighde]], and the Manx king [[Gofraidh mac Amhlaibh]]: the Outer Hebrides remained under the control of Gofraidh, but the Inner Hebrides were ruled separately by Somhairle. Two years later, Somhairle successfully invaded the [[Isle of Man]], took [[King of Mann and the Isles|the throne]], and ruled the entire Kingdom of Mann and the Isles until his death in 1164.<ref>[[#O1|Woolf 2004]]: p. 104.</ref>

==Lj<U+00F3>t<U+00F3>lfr in the ''Orkneyinga saga''==

One of the most prominent characters of the ''Orkneyinga saga'' is the Viking chieftain Sveinn <U+00C1>sleifarson, who lived on the island of [[Gairsay]], in [[Orkney]].<ref name="Beuermann"/> The saga relates how Sveinn's father, <U+00D3>l<U+00E1>fr Hr<U+00F3>lfsson, was one of several chieftains who supported [[Paul Haakonsson|P<U+00E1>ll H<U+00E1>konsson]], [[Earl of Orkney]], in a victorious sea battle against a fleet led by [[<U+00D6>lvir R<U+00F3>sta]] in support of [[R<U+00F6>gnvald Kali Kolsson|R<U+00F6>gnvaldr Kolsson]],<ref>[[#A1|Anderson 1873]]: pp. 87&ndash;90.</ref> who had been appointed the earl of half of Orkney by the King of Norway.<ref>[[#A1|Anderson 1873]]: pp. 82&ndash;83.</ref>{{#tag:ref|A.O. Anderson suggested the date of this battle to be 26 June 1136.<ref name="A2-192">[[#A2|Anderson 1922]]: p. 192.</ref>|group=note}} <U+00D3>l<U+00E1>fr was later burned to death inside his own house by <U+00D6>lvir,<ref>[[#A1|Anderson 1873]]: pp. 91&ndash;92.</ref> the grandson of Frak<U+00F6>kk, an ambitious woman, portrayed as a villain in the saga. Frak<U+00F6>kk attempted to win the [[Earldom of Orkney]] for her descendants&mdash;particularly <U+00D6>lvir.<ref name="W1-129133"/> 

The saga relates how in Orkney, Sveinn murdered one of the earl's followers, and immediately fled to the [[Bishop of Orkney]]. The bishop protected Sveinn by sending him away to the ''Su<U+00F0>reyjar'', into the care of Holdbo<U+00F0>i Hundason, a chieftain on the [[Inner Hebridean]] island of [[Tiree]].<ref>[[#A1|Anderson 1873]]: pp. 92&ndash;95.</ref> Later, in early spring,{{#tag:ref|A.O. Anderson dated this to the spring of 1136.<ref name="A2-192"/>|group=note}} the saga relates how Sveinn travelled to [[Atholl]], where he stayed for a long period of time. From Atholl, Sveinn made his way back towards Orkney by land, and on the journey northwards, he passed through [[Thurso]], in [[Caithness]]. The saga notes that Sveinn was accompanied by Lj<U+00F3>t<U+00F3>lfr, and that Sveinn had spent much of the previous spring with Lj<U+00F3>t<U+00F3>lfr.<ref name="A1-105106">[[#A1|Anderson 1873]]: pp. 105&ndash;106.</ref> The chieftain who lived at Thurso was an [[Jarl (title)|earl]] named ''<U+00D3>ttarr'', who is described as "a man worthy of honour".<ref name="W1-129133">[[#W1|Williams 2007]]: pp. 129&ndash;133.</ref> Earl <U+00D3>ttarr was a brother of Frak<U+00F6>kk, and the saga relates how Lj<U+00F3>t<U+00F3>lfr negotiated a truce between Sveinn and Earl <U+00D3>ttarr, after Sveinn's father was killed by <U+00D6>lvir.<ref name="A1-105106"/>

The saga states that Sveinn made numerous Viking expeditions throughout the [[Hebrides]], and into the [[Irish Sea]] zone. On one such occasion, Sveinn set up a base on the [[Isle of Man]], where he married a wealthy widow. Some time later, Sveinn and his men were attacked by a force led by Holdbo<U+00F0>i, and in consequence Sveinn left the island and sailed north into the Hebrides to [[Lewis]].<ref name="Anderson-118119">[[#A1|Anderson 1873]]: pp. 118&ndash;119.</ref>{{#tag:ref|A.O. Anderson dated the marriage to no earlier than 1140; he dated the attack to no earlier than 1141; and dated Sveinn leaving the island for Lewis, no earlier than the year 1142.<ref>[[#A2|Anderson 1922]]: p. 193&ndash;194.</ref>|group=note}}

Further on in the saga, it is stated that Sveinn's brother, Gunni <U+00D3>l<U+00E1>fsson, had children with Margr<U+00E9>t H<U+00E1>konard<U+00F3>ttir, mother of [[Harald Maddadsson|Haraldr Madda<U+00F0>arson]], Earl of Orkney, [[Mormaer of Caithness]]. Because of this relationship with his mother, Haraldr banished Gunni from the earldom, and enmity arose between Sveinn and the earl. Sveinn then sent Gunni to stay with Lj<U+00F3>t<U+00F3>lfr on Lewis, with whom Sveinn himself had stayed at an earlier time. The saga also states that at this time, Lj<U+00F3>t<U+00F3>lfr's son, Fugl, was with Haraldr, and consequently there was a "coldness" between Fugl and Sveinn.<ref>[[#A1|Anderson 1873]]: p. 154.</ref> The saga relates that Sveinn stole a ship from Fugl, who had been travelling to Orkney to meet Haraldr.<ref>[[#A1|Anderson 1873]]: p. 155.</ref> However, subsequently a relation of Fugl's, named ''Anakol'', who became a friend of Sveinn, succeeded in making peace between the two.<ref>[[#A1|Anderson 1873]]: p. 156.</ref>{{#tag:ref|A.O. Anderson dated the events concerning Fugl to the year 1154.<ref>[[#A2|Anderson 1922]]: p. 236.</ref>|group=note}} Historian Garreth Williams noted that Anakol's name is [[Gaelic language|Gaelic]] in origin, and like Lj<U+00F3>t<U+00F3>lfr and Fugl, he is described as being originally from the Hebrides. The saga also states that he was from a good family.<ref>[[#W1|Williams 2007]]: p. 139.</ref>{{#tag:ref|According to Anderson's English edition of the saga (1873), later on Anakol's brother, Arnfinnr, and three other men, including a man named ''Lj<U+00F3>t<U+00F3>lfr'', were all taken prisoner by followers of Haraldr following a brief skirmish.<ref>[[#A1|Anderson 1873]]: p. 159.</ref> [[Gudbrand Vigfusson|Vigfusson]]'s [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] edition (1887) gives the man's name as ''Lj<U+00F3>tr'', but a corresponding [[footnote]] reads "''Lj<U+00F3>tr''] Lj<U+00F3>t<U+00F3>lfr, Fl.".<ref>[[#V1|Vigfusson 1887]]: p. 187.</ref> P<U+00E1>lsson and Edwards' English edition (1981) gives this man's name as ''Lj<U+00F3>tr''.<ref>[[#P2|P<U+00E1>lsson; Edwards 1981]]: p. 182.</ref>|group=note}}
