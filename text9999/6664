'''Robert Coleman''' rose from a holding clerkship at a [[prothonotary]]'s office in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] to [[bookkeeper]] at [[Cornwall Iron Furnace]] to becoming Pennsylvania's first [[millionaire]]. [http://www.phmc.state.pa.us/ppet/cornwall/page4.asp?secid=31]

==Iron baron==
Coleman arrived in Phildelphia from Ireland in 1764. After serving as a clerk and bookkeeper he went on to acquire a lease on Salford Forge near [[Norristown, Pennsylvania|Norristown]] in 1773 and immeadiately made a sizeable profit by manufacturing [[cannonball]]s and shot at Salford and Elizabeth Furnaces. He then used his profits to purchase a two thirds share of Elizabeth Furnace, shares of Cornwall and the Upper and Lower Hopewell Furnaces, (not the similarly named [[Hopewell Furnace]]), and ownership of [[Speedwell Forge]]. Soon Coleman was able to construct Colebrook Furnace, purchase the rest of Elizabeth Furnace and acquired 80 percent ownership of Cornwall Furnace and the ore mines nearby. His business acquisitions and the profits turned from them enabled him to become the first millionaire in the history of Pennsylvania. 

==Politics==
Coleman spent more than three decades serving the citizens of Pennsylvania. He was a member of the [[Federalist Party]].  His career in government began when he attended the Pennsylvania State Constitutional Convention in 1776.  Additionally, he served in the Pennsylvania legislature in 1783, attended the Pennsylvania convention to ratify the [[United States Constitution]] in 1787, was chosen as a [[Presidential elector]] in both 1792 and 1796, and held the position of Associate Judge from 1791 to 1811.  In 1795, Coleman achieved his lone military accomplishment when, as Captain of the Lancaster Troop of Light Horse, he led a company of thirty-five cavalrymen to Western Pennsylvania to assist in the suppression of the [[Whiskey Rebellion]].  

==Family==
Coleman married Anne Old, the daughter of his former employer at Quittapahilla and Speedwell Forges, James Old. Robert and Anne had ten children. His family ultimately settled in [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania|Lancaster]] in 1808. Two of his daughters, Anne Caroline and Sarah would meet tragic ends.

Anne Caroline began dating future [[United States President]] [[James Buchanan]] in 1818. Buchanan was at the time a [[lawyer]] in [[Lancaster County, Pennsylvania|Lancaster County]]. They soon became engaged, much to Robert Coleman's displeasure. Coleman was apparently unhappy with Buchanan's reputation and checkered history at [[Dickinson College]] in [[Carlisle, Pennsylvania]]. Rumors abounded that Buchanan was marrying Anne Caroline for her money, as well as seeing other women. After one incident of him visiting a friend's wife (this may have been an innocent visit), Ann broke off their engagement and soon after died, probably from an [[overdose]] of [[laudanum]]. Some historians theorize this may have been a [[suicide]][http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/1955/1/1955_1_20.shtml]. James Buchanan was so devasted by the broken engagement and suicide that he vowed never to marry and eventually became the only [[bachelor]] President in the history of the United States.

Coleman's other daughter Sarah also committed suicide. She loved William Augustus Muhlenburg who was co-[[rector]] of St. James Episcopal Church in Lancaster. Robert again disapproved of his daughter's relationship. Coleman and Muhlenburg had a bitter dispute about evening [[worship service]]s. Upon Coleman's death in 1825, Sarah had hoped to be able to finally marry the rector. Coleman's will granted his sons Edward and James the right to approve of Sarah's spouse. Edward also dislike Muhlenburg and would not approve the marriage. Sarah then fled to Philadelphia and committed suicide.

On August 14, 1825, at age seventy-seven, Coleman died in Lancaster. Coleman was one of the wealthiest and most respected men in Pennsylvania.
