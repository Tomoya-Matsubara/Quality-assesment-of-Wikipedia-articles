'''Alpha Phi Alpha''' ('''<U+0391><U+03A6><U+0391>''') is the first intercollegiate [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternity]] established by [[African American]]s. Founded on [[December 4]], [[1906]], on the campus of [[Cornell University]] ({{coor d|42.448510|N|-76.478620|E|scale:10000}}) in [[Ithaca, New York]], as a social fraternity, Alpha Phi Alpha has initiated over 175,000 men into the organization and has been open to men of all races since 1945. The fraternity utilizes motifs and artifacts from [[Ancient Egypt]] to represent the organization and preserves its archives at the [[Moorland-Spingarn Research Center]].

The founders, Henry Callis, Charles Chapman, Eugene Jones, George Kelley, Nathaniel Murray, Robert Ogle, and Vertner Tandy, are collectively known as the "[[:Category:Alpha Phi Alpha founders|Seven Jewels]]". The fraternity expanded when a second chapter was chartered at [[Howard University]] in 1907. Beginning in 1908, Alpha Phi Alpha became the prototype for other Black Greek Letter Organizations (BGLO). Today, there are over 680 active Alpha chapters in the Americas, Africa, Europe, Asia, the West Indies, and the [[Virgin Islands]]

Alpha Phi Alpha evolved into a primarily service organization and has provided leadership and service during the Great Depression, [[World war|World Wars]], [[Civil rights movement#Civil Rights Movement in the United States|Civil Rights Movements]], and addresses social issues such as [[wiktionary:apartheid|apartheid]] and urban housing, and other economic, cultural, and political issues affecting [[black people|people of color]]. The [[Martin Luther King, Jr. National Memorial]] is a project of Alpha Phi Alpha and the fraternity jointly leads philanthropic programming initiatives with [[March of Dimes]], [[Head Start]], [[Boy Scouts of America]] and [[Big Brothers Big Sisters of America]].

Members of Alpha Phi Alpha include former [[Jamaica]]n [[Prime Minister]] and [[Rhodes Scholarship|Rhodes Scholar]] [[Norman Manley]], [[Nobel Prize]] winner [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], former [[Vice President of the United States|U.S. Vice President]] [[Hubert Humphrey]], [[Olympic Games|Olympian]] [[Jesse Owens]], [[Supreme Court of the United States|Justice]] [[Thurgood Marshall]], former [[United Nations]] [[Ambassador]] [[Andrew Young]], and former [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]] [[Mayor]] [[Maynard Jackson]]. Numerous other American leaders are among the [[List of Alpha Phi Alpha brothers|men]] who have adopted the fraternity<U+2019>s principles&mdash;''manly deeds, scholarship, and love for all mankind''.

==History==
===Founding===
[[Image:Cornell Arts Quad 1919.jpg|right|thumb|The Arts Quad of [[Cornell University]] in 1919. Cornell University was the site of the founding of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc., in 1905, although the organization would remain unnamed until 1906.]]
At the start of the 20<SUP>th</SUP> century, black students attending American universities were often excluded from the personal and close associations the predominantly [[Caucasian race|white]] student population enjoyed in existing fraternal organizations.<ref name=wesley15-16> Wesley 1981, ''op. cit.'', pp. 15<U+2013>16.</ref> During the 1905<U+2013>06 school year, [[Cornell University]] witnessed the organization of the first Greek letter fraternity for black students, by black students. Alpha Phi Alpha was organized with the stated desire of providing a mechanism to build those associations and provide mutual support among African American students. At the outset, there was disagreement about the group's purpose. Some desired to organize a social and literary club where all persons could participate. Others in the group supported a traditional fraternal organization. The overwhelming sentiment was dissatisfaction with lack of access to a literary society and members proposed to enlarge the functions of the group. The fraternal supporters were in the minority and the society thereafter organized with the intention of providing a literary, study, social, and support group for all minority students who encountered social and academic racial prejudice.<ref name=wesley15-16/> 

[[Image:Alphacharter.jpeg|100px|thumb|right|The 1906 [[charter]] for <U+0391><U+03A6><U+0391>'s Alpha chapter at [[Cornell University]].]]

At the first meetings during the [[1906]]<U+2013>[[1907]] school year, members formed the nucleus of the organization's internal structure for the yet-unnamed "society". On [[October 23]], [[1906]], Callis and Jones, acquainted with the [[Greek language]], proposed that the organization be known by the Greek letters '''Alpha Phi Alpha''', and Ogle proposed the colors to be old gold and black. The fraternity was still in process of formation and the divisive issue of whether the terms "club" or "fraternity" be used was debated within the group.<ref name=Wesley19-27> Wesley 1981, ''op. cit.'', pp. 19<U+2013>27. </ref>

By [[December 4]], [[1906]], the members' views changed and the decision was made to become a fraternity. The prior designations of "club", "organization", and "society" were permanently removed.<ref name=Wesley19-27/>  

====The Seven Jewels====
The original founding members of the first collegiate Greek letter organization for [[Negro]] students, with the [[Great Sphinx of Giza]] (built by [[Pharaoh]] [[Khafra|Khafre]]) as their symbol were Henry Arthur Callis, Charles Henry Chapman, George Biddle Kelley, Nathaniel Allison Murray, Robert Harold Ogle, Vertner Woodson Tandy, and James Morton. The latter would be replaced in 1952 with the name of Eugene Kinckle Jones.<ref>Wesley 1981, ''op. cit.'', pp.26<U+2013>31, 92.</ref>

===Consolidation and expansion===
Soon after the Cornell organization formed, members opened Alpha Phi Alpha chapters at other colleges and universities. Chapters of Alpha Phi Alpha are given [[Greek alphabet|Greek-letter]] designations, assigned in order of installation into the Fraternity. No chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha is designated [[Omega]], the last letter of the Greek alphabet that traditionally signifies "the end". Deceased brothers are respectfully referred to as having joined Omega Chapter.

[[Image:alphaconstitution.jpg|100px|thumb|left|The 1907 <U+0391><U+03A6>A Constitution and By-Laws]]
The fraternity's constitution was adopted on [[December 14]], [[1907]], limiting  membership to "Negro male" students and providing that the General Convention of the Fraternity would be created following the establishment of the fourth chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha.<ref name=USWW>{{cite web |url=http://apa.usww.com/alphatoc/frathistory.htm |title=<U+0391><U+03A6>A Fraternity History |publisher=Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Zeta Iota Chapter |accessdate=2006-04-14}}</ref> The [[preamble]] states the purpose of Alpha Phi Alpha in part as: <blockquote>To promote a more perfect union among college men; to aid in and insist upon the personal progress of its members; to further brotherly love and a fraternal spirit within the organization; to discountenance evil; to destroy all prejudices; to preserve the sanctity of the home, the personification of virtue and the chastity of woman.</blockquote>

[[Howard University]], on [[December 20]], [[1907]], where founders Jones and Murray chartered the fraternity's second chapter, (''Beta''), was the site of the organization of the first black Greek letter organization among [[Historically black colleges and universities|historically black schools]].<ref>Wesley 1981, ''op. cit.'', pp. 43.</ref>  Jones and Murray established (''Gamma'') on [[December 30]], 1907 at [[Virginia Union University]].

The [[w:Secretary of State (U.S. state government)|Secretary of State]] of [[New York]] accepted the incorporation of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity on [[January 29]] [[1908]]. The purpose and objective of the fraternity within these [[articles of incorporation]] was declared to be "educational and for the mutual uplift of its members."<ref name=USWW/>  

[[Image:alphafstconvent.jpg|right|thumb|The first General Convention of Alpha Phi Alpha, held at [[Howard University]] in 1908]]
The fraternity became international when it chartered a chapter at the [[University of Toronto]] in 1908, (although shortly thereafter the chapter became defunct and its seat was transferred to what is now [[Huston-Tillotson University]] in [[Austin, Texas]]). Other international chapters have been chartered in [[London]], England, [[Frankfurt]], Germany, [[Monrovia]], Liberia, the [[Caribbean]] and [[South Korea]].<ref name=epsilontheta>{{cite web |url=http://www.bgsu.edu/studentlife/greeks/alpha-phi-alpha/history.htm |title=History of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc. |publisher=Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Epsilon Theta Chapter |accessdate=2006-04-05}}</ref>

The fraternity established its first [[Alumnus/a|alumni]] chapter ''Alpha Lambda'' in 1911 in [[Louisville, Kentucky]]. The Fraternity was again incorporated as a national organization on [[April 9]], [[1911]], under the laws of [[United States Congress|Congress]] within the District of Columbia, under the name and title of '''The Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity'''.<ref name=dcra>{{cite web |url=http://mblr.dc.gov/corp/lookup/status.asp?id=6210 |title=District of Columiba Organization Information |publisher=dcra.dc.gov |accessdate=2006-08-15}}</ref>

[[Image:SphinxMagazine.jpg|right|thumb|The cover of the 2000 edition of ''The Sphinx'' magazine, the fraternity's official journal]]
For nearly 100 years Alpha Phi Alpha and its members have had a voice and influence on politics, current-affairs and key issues facing the world as founder and [[Editing#Executive editor|editor]] of national publications.  The ''[[The Crisis]]'', the official magazine of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP), was started by fraternity member [[W.E.B. DuBois]] in 1910. In 1914, ''The Sphinx<U+00AE>'', named after the [[Great Sphinx of Giza|Egyptian landmark]], began publication as the fraternity's official journal. Still published, ''The Crisis'' and ''The Sphinx'' are the first and second oldest continuously published black journals in the United States, respectively.<ref name=cornell-library>{{cite web | url=http://rmc.library.cornell.edu/alpha/ |title=<U+0391><U+03A6><U+0391>:A Brief History |publisher=rmc.library.cornell.edu |accessdate=2006-05-04}}</ref>  The [[National Urban League]]'s (NUL) ''Opportunity Journal'', was first published in 1923 under the leadership of Alpha founder Eugene Jones, with fraternity brother [[Charles S.

The Training Camp at [[Des Moines, Iowa|Fort Des Moines]] during [[World War I]] was the result of the fraternity's advocacy in lobbying the government to create an [[w:Officer (armed forces)|Officer]]s<U+2019> training camp for [[Buffalo Soldier|black troops]]. Thirty-two Alpha men were granted commissions (four were made [[Captain#Army and Marines|Captains]] and ninety percent were [[First Lieutenant#United States|First Lieutenants]]).

[[Image:Noble Sissle.jpg|thumb|Alpha Phi Alpha member and [[Harlem Renaissance]] entertainer [[Noble Sissle]]; photo taken by [[Carl Van Vechten]], 1951]]

The Fraternity's [[#National programs|national programs]] date back to 1919 with the "Go-To-[[High school|High School]], Go-to-[[University|College"]] campaign to promote academic achievement within the African-American community being the first initiative. Alpha Phi Alpha would later participate in the [[Voting Rights Act|voting rights]] debate and coined the well-known phrase ''A Voteless People is a Hopeless People'' as part of its effort to register black voters. The slogan remains in Alpha Phi Alpha's continuing voter registration campaign.<ref name=epsilontheta />

The [[1920s]] witnessed the birth of the [[Harlem Renaissance]]&ndash;a flowering of African American [[African American art|art]], [[African American literature|literature]], [[African American music|music]], and [[African American culture|culture]]  which began to be absorbed into mainstream [[Culture of the United States|American culture]].  Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity brothers Charles Johnson, W.E.B. DuBois, [[Noble Sissle]], [[Countee Cullen]] and other members were entrepreneurs and participants in this creative upsurge led primarily by the African American community based in [[Harlem]], [[New York City]].  The fraternity had charted 85 chapters throughout the United States and initiated over 3,000 members by the end of the 1920s.<ref name=alphavideo/>

During the [[Great Depression]], Alpha Phi Alpha and its members continued to implement programs which it deemed affected the black community.  The Committee on Public Policy, the Alpha Phi Alpha Education Foundation and "The Foundation Publishers" were established at the 1933 general convention.  The Committee on Public Policy took positions on issues many in the black community deemed important. The first investigation of the committee was of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]] agencies. The committee's agenda was to determine the status of the black population, both as to treatment of agencies' employees and in the quality of services rendered to American blacks.<ref name=Wesley204-205> Wesley 1981, ''op. cit.'', pp. 204<U+2013>205.</ref>  Fraternity members [[Rayford Logan]] and Eugene Jones were members of Roosevelt's unofficial [[Black Cabinet]].<ref>Mason 1999, ''op. cit.'' pp. 60</ref>  The Education Foundation was created in recognition of the increasing educational, economic, and social needs of African Americans in the United States.  The foundation, led by Rayford Logan, was structured to provide scholarships and grants to African American students.  The Foundation Publishers would provide financial support and fellowship for writers addressing African American issues.  Historian and fraternity brother [[John Hope Franklin]] was an early beneficiary of the publishing company.<ref name=alphavideo/>

The New Negro Alliance (NNA) was founded in 1933 by fraternity brother [[Belford Lawson, Jr.]] in Washington D.C. to combat white-run business in black neighborhoods that would not hire black employees. The NNA instituted a then-radical ''Don't Buy Where You Can't Work'' campaign, and organized or threatened [[boycott]]s against white-owned business. In response, some businesses arranged for an injunction to stop the picketing. NNA lawyers, including Lawson and Thurgood Marshall, fought back <U+2014> all the way to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] in ''[[New Negro Alliance v.

The NNA estimated that by 1940, the group had secured 5,106 jobs for blacks because businesses could not afford to lose sales during the depression.<ref name=ctdcNNA>{{cite web |url=http://www.culturaltourismdc.org/info-url3948/info-url_show.htm?doc_id=212961&attrib_id=7970 |title=New Negro Alliance's Sanitary Grocery Protest Site |publisher=Cultural Tourism: District of Columbia |accessdate=2006-04-29}}</ref>  The fraternity sponsors an annual ''Belford V.

Alpha Phi Alpha supported legal battles against [[Racial segregation|segregation]] and Alpha trial lawyers argued many of the nation's major court cases involving [[civil rights]] and [[civil liberties]]. The case of ''Donald Gaines Murray v University of Maryland'' (1935) was initiated by the fraternity and successfully argued by Alpha men Thurgood Marshall and [[Charles Hamilton Houston|Charles Houston]] to successfully challenge biases at the university which had no laws requiring segregation in its colleges.  The fraternity assisted in a similar case that involved fraternity brother [[Lloyd L. Gaines|Lloyd Gaines]]. In [[Missouri ex rel. Gaines v. Canada|Gaines v. Canada]], the most important segregation case since [[Plessy v. Ferguson]], Gaines was denied admission to the Law School at the [[University of Missouri - Columbia|University of Missouri]] because he was black.<ref>Wesley 1981,'' op. cit.'', pp. 217<U+2013>218.</ref>  Alpha brothers Houston and Sidney Redmon successfully argued "States that provide only one educational institution must allow blacks and whites to attend if there is no separate school for blacks." 

[[Image:Attack on Pearl Harbor US Propaganda.jpg|thumb|175px|Alpha Phi Alpha supported the [[United States|U.S.]] after the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]] inflamed U.S. sentiments against [[Japan]] as shown in U.S. propaganda.]]

In 1940, true to its form as the "first of first", Alpha Phi Alpha sought to end racial discrimination within its membership.  The use of the word "Negro" in the membership clause of the constitution which referred to "any Negro male student" would be changed to read "any male student."  This  was the first official action by a BGLO to allow the admission of all colors and races; the fraternity has been interracial since 1945.<ref> Wesley 1981, ''op. cit.'', pp. 244.</ref><ref name=multiracial>{{cite web |url=http://www.alphaphialpha.net/membership/aspirants.html |title=<U+0391><U+03A6><U+0391> Integrates the Fraternity |publisher=alphaphialpha.net |accessdate=2006-04-26}}</ref>

After the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]] in 1941 and the nation's entry into [[World War II]], the fraternity fought to secure  rights for its membership within the ranks of Officers in the [[Armed forces|Armed Forces]].   The type of [[War#Types of war and warfare|warfare]] encountered evidenced the nexus between education and war, with illiteracy decreasing a soldier's usefulness to the Army that could only be addressed with the inclusion of a large number of college educated men among the ranks of officers.  Alpha men served in almost every branch of the [[Military of the United States|military]] and civilian defense programs during World War II.  The leadership of the fraternity encouraged Alpha men to buy [[war bond]]s, and the membership responded with their purchases.<ref> Wesley 1981, ''op. cit.'', pp. 248.</ref>  The fraternity's long tradition of military service has remained strong to the United States and the world.  Alpha's military leaders [[Samuel Gravely]] and [[Benjamin Thurman Hacker|Benjamin Hacker]] are followed by other fraternity members who lead and serve in the Armed Forces.

In 1946, fraternity brother [[Paul Robeson]], in a [[Letter to the editor]], published in [[The New York Times]], referring to apartheid and [[South Africa]]'s impending request to annex [[South-West Africa]], a [[League of Nations mandate]], appealed: {{cquote|to my fellow Americans to make known their protest against such conditions to the [[Diplomatic mission|South African Ministry]] in Washington; to send to the Council on African Affairs, an expression of support for these grievously oppressed workers in South Africa; to keep the South African situation in mind against the time when [[General]] [[Jan Smuts|Smuts]] will come to the [[United Nations|United Nations Assembly]] to demand the annexation of South West Africa, which means more Africans for him to exploit.<ref name=robeson>{{cite web |url=http://www.bayarearobeson.org/Chronology_5.htm |title=The 20th Century's Greatest Renaissance Man |publisher=bayarearobeson.org |accessdate=2006-07-23}}</ref>}}  In 1947, Alpha Phi Alpha awarded Robeson the ''Alpha Medallion'' for his <U+201C>outstanding role as a champion of freedom.<U+201D><ref name=robeson/>  South Africa formally excluded [[Walvis Bay]] from the mandate and annexed it as a South African [[Enclave and exclave|enclave]].  It took until after the date for the first fully democratic elections in South Africa in [[1994]] had been set, before [[sovereignty]] over Walvis Bay was formally transferred to [[Namibia]] at midnight on [[February 28]], [[1994]].

===History: 1950<U+2013>1969===
The general convention in 1952 was the venue for a significant historical action taken regarding the Seventh Jewel Founder.  The decision "of placing Brother [Eugene] Jones in his true historical setting resulting from the leading role which he had played in the origin and development of the early years of the fraternity history" was made by a special committee consisting of Jewels Callis, Kelly and Murray and fraternity historian [[Charles H. Wesley]].  James Morton was removed as a founder, yet continues to be listed as one of the first initiates.

===History: 1970<U+2013>2000===
Beginning in the 1970s, new goals were being introduced to address current environment.  The older social programs and policies were still supported, however; under the direction of General President [[Ernest Nathan Morial|Ernest Morial]] the fraternity turned its attention to new social needs.  This included the campaign to eliminate the [[Ghetto#Ghettos in the United States|ghetto-goal]] on numerous fronts with housing development and entrepreneurship initiatives. 

[[Image:Callistower.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Henry Arthur Callis Tower, the centerpiece of Channelwood Village in Akron, Ohio&mdash;namesake of a [[Henry A. Callis|founder]] of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity.]]
The [[Federal Housing Administration#Effects|Federal Housing Act (of 1963)]] requested [[non-profit organization]]s to get involved with providing housing for [[Poverty|low-income]] families, individuals and senior citizens.  Alpha Phi Alpha was poised to take advantage of this program with government in improving urban housing living conditions.  The Eta Tau Lambda chapter created Alpha Phi Alpha Homes Inc. with [[w:James R. Williams (lawyer)|James R. Williams]] as the chairman to address these needs in [[Akron, Ohio]].  In 1971, Alpha Homes received an $11.5 million grant from [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development|HUD]] to begin groundbreaking on ''Channelwood Village'' with the ''Henry Arthur Callis Tower'' as it centerpiece.  Channelwood contains additional structures named after General Presidents James R. Williams and Charles Wesley, and streets named for fraternity founders Tandy and Ogle.  The ''Alpha Towers'' in [[Chicago]] and three other urban housing developments in [[St. Louis, Missouri]]&mdash; the ''Alpha Gardens'', ''Alpha Towne'' and ''Alpha Village'' saw completion through Alpha Phi Alpha leadership.<ref> Wesley 1981, ''op. cit.'', pp. 472<U+2013>480.</ref>

In 1976, the fraternity celebrated its 70th Anniversary with dual convention locations: New York City and Monrovia.  The fraternity launched the ''Million Dollar Fund Drive'' with three prime beneficiaries&mdash;the [[United Negro College Fund]] (UNCF), the National Urban League and the NAACP.  The Executive Director of the NAACP stated, "Alpha Phi Alpha provided the largest single gift ever received by the civil rights group."<ref name=ebony8911/>

In 1981, the fraternity celebrated its [[Diamond Jubilee]] in [[Dallas, Texas]], featuring a presentation of the ''New Thrust Program'' consisting of the ''Million Dollar Fund Drive'', the Leadership Development and Citizenship Institutes, and the quest to obtain a [[Martin Luther King Day|national holiday]] for fraternity brother Martin Luther King, Jr.<ref>Mason 1999, ''op. cit.'', pp. 352.</ref>

As the 21<SUP>st</SUP> century approached, Alpha Phi Alpha's long-term commitment to the social and economic improvement of humanity remained at the top of its agenda.  The fraternity's 28<SUP>th</SUP> General President, [[Henry Ponder]], said "We would like the public to perceive Alpha Phi Alpha as a group of college-trained, professional men who are very much concerned and sensitive to the needs of humankind; We will go to great lengths to lend our voices, our time, our expertise and our money to solve the problems that humankind must solve as we move into the 21<SUP>st</SUP> century."<ref name=ebony8911/>

In 1996, The ''World Policy Council'' (WPC) was created as a [[think tank]] to expand Alpha Phi Alpha's involvement in politics, and social and current policy to encompass international concerns.

"A Voteless People is a Hopeless People" was initiated as a National Program of Alpha during the 1930s when many African-Americans had the right to vote but were prevented from voting because of poll taxes, threats of reprisal, and lack of education about the voting process. Voter education and registration has since remained a dominant focus in the fraternity's planning. In the 1990s the focus has shifted to promotion of political awareness and empowerment, delivered most often through use of town meetings and candidate forums.<ref name=voterpgm>{{cite web |url=http://www.alphaphialpha.net/alpha/today/programs/voteless.html |title=<U+0391><U+03A6>A Voter Registration Program |publisher=alphaphialpha.net |accessdate=2006-04-06}} (archive)</ref>  Members are required to be registered voters, and to participate in the national voter registration program.<ref name=davidson>{{cite web |last=Giduz |first=Bill |url=http://www2.davidson.edu/common/templates/news/news_tmp03.asp?newsid=1805 |title=Charter for Historically Black Fraternity Makes History at Davidson |work=News & Events |publisher=Davidson College |accessdate=2006-12-28}}</ref>

===Membership intake===
[[Image:Alphapledges.jpg|left|thumb|<U+0391><U+03A6><U+0391> Pledge Line of Sphinxmen, [[Cornell University]].]]
The pledge period is the time that a pledge or potential new member of the fraternity engages in before being initiated as a member.  This period is the time the [[pledge]] learns of the organization's history, principles and tenacity of brotherhood.  

An Alpha Phi Alpha Pledge is initially referred to as a "Sphinxman", and later an "Ape" during "Hell Week" when pledges are submitted to compounded endurances.

In the selection of candidates for membership, certain chapters had not escaped challenges of racial stereotyping and allegations of [[colorism]].  In a biography of Justice Thurgood Marshall, the authors recounted how certain chapters of the fraternity used a "brown paper bag test" and would not consider students whose skin color was darker than the bag.<ref>{{cite book |last=Davis |first=Michael D. |coauthors=Hunter R.

There are periods in the history of the fraternity where [[hazing]] was involved in certain pledge lines.  The fraternity has never condoned hazing, but has been aware of problems with "rushing" and "initiations" dated as far back as the 1934 General Convention when the fraternity founders communicated their concern with physical violence in initiation ceremonies.<ref>  Wesley 1981, ''op. cit.'', pp. 214.</ref>  At the 1940 General Convention, a pledge manual was discussed that would contain a brief general history, the list of chapters and locations, the achievements of Alpha men, outstanding Alpha men, and pledge procedures.<ref> Wesley 1981, ''op. cit.'', pp. 242.</ref>

[[Image:APhiA Pin.JPG|thumb|left|The Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity pin with [[Greek alphabet|Greek letters]], and seven [[pearl]]s  in recognition of the founders of the fraternity.]]

Hazing is now against the law in many U.S. states; that and the objections of parents, students, and fraternity alumni have prompted Alpha Phi Alpha to implement its current policy abolishing pledging as a means of obtaining membership.  The fraternity's official policy is that hazing is against the purposes and goals of the Fraternity and has been discontinued as a condition or manner of initiation into the membership of Alpha Phi Alpha. It is no longer legal within the organization for members to establish a pledge line or to require aspirants to the organization to submit to hazing. All membership intake activities for the fraternity are conducted by the National Intake Office and must occur in the presence of a National Intake Officer.<ref name=alphaintake>{{cite web |url=http://www.alpha-phi-alpha.org/Page.php?id=157 |title=<U+0391><U+03A6><U+0391> Membership Intake Policy |publisher=alphaphialpha.net |accessdate=2007-06-12}}</ref>

==Egyptian symbolism==
{{Further|[http://egypt.ebeling.ee Panoramas of the Giza Plateau]}}

[[Image:Great Sphinx Closeup.JPG|thumb|185px|left|Alpha Phi Alpha chose to use Egyptian symbology more representative of the members' [[Africa]]n heritage. The [[Great Sphinx of Giza]] and [[Giza pyramid complex|Great Pyramids of Giza]] are fraternity icons.]]

Alpha Phi Alpha utilizes motifs from [[Ancient Egypt]] and uses images and songs depicting the Her-em-akhet ([[Great Sphinx of Giza]]), [[pharaoh]]s, and other [[Egypt]]ian artifacts to represent the organization.  This is in contrast to other fraternities that traditionally echo themes from the golden age of [[Ancient Greece]].  Alpha's constant reference to [[Ethiopia]] in hymns and poems are further examples of Alpha's mission to imbue itself with an African cultural heritage.  Fraternity brother Charles H. Wesley wrote, "To the Alpha Phi Alpha brotherhood, African history and civilization, the Sphinx, and Ethiopian tradition bring new meanings and these are interpreted with new significance to others.  The [[Giza pyramid complex|Great Pyramids of Giza]], symbols of foundation, sacred geometry and more, are other African images chosen by Alpha Phi Alpha as fraternity icons.<ref name=munualphas>{{cite web |url=http://www.munualphas.com/part4.html |title=Black sponsored Greek letter organization |publisher=Alphi Phi Alpha Fraternity, Mu Nu Chapter |accessdate=2007-04-21}}</ref>  Pharaoh often appears and is a title used to refer to the Egyptian [[god-king]]s.

==Centennial celebration==
Alpha Phi Alpha declared 2006 the beginning of its "Centennial Era" as it readied for its [[Centennial|Centenary]], framed by the [[slogan]] ''First of All, Servants of All, We Shall Transcend All''.  These preparations consisted of nationwide activities and events, including the commissioning of intellectual and scholarly works, presentation of exhibits, lectures, artwork and musical expositions, the production of film and video presentations and a Centennial Convention July 25<U+2013>30, 2006, in Washington, D.C.

[[Image:APhiA Cornell 007.jpg|right|thumb|[[template:Alpha Phi Alpha General Presidents|Alpha Phi Alpha General Presidents]] at centennial memorial site, [[Cornell University]] campus.]]
The ''2006 Centennial Celebration Kickoff'' launched with a "pilgrimage" to Cornell University on [[November 19]], [[2005]].  That event brought over 700 fraternity members who gathered for a day long program.  Members journeyed across campus and unveiled a new centennial memorial to Alpha Phi Alpha.  The memorial&mdash;a wall in the form of a "'''J'''" in recognition of the ''Jewels''&mdash;features a bench and a plaque and is situated in front of the university's Barnes Hall.<ref name=cornellnews />

The House of Representatives passed ''House Concurrent Resolution 384'', approved 422-0, which recognized and honored Alpha Phi Alpha as the first intercollegiate Greek-letter fraternity established for African Americans, its accomplishments and its historic milestone.<ref name=davidscott/>

==Black college Greek movement==
[[Image:alphahistorybook.gif|right|thumb|The cover of ''The History of Alpha Phi Alpha''.]]

The first successful attempt in founding a collegiate Black Greek letter Organization (BGLO) by African Americans is accomplished in 1906 by 7 college students (Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity) on the white college campus of Cornell University.<ref name=munualphas/>  Alpha Phi Alpha is also the first Greek letter organization established at a historically black college in 1907 at Howard University.    

[[Alpha Kappa Alpha]] was founded in 1908 at Howard as the first among African-American [[wiktionary:sorority|sororities]] and among BGLOs founded at a black college.<ref name=NPHCarchive>{{cite web |url=http://groups.msn.com/NPHCArchivePhotoSociety/didyouknow.msnw|title=NPHC Archive Photo Society |accessdate=2006-12-22}}</ref>  

BGLOs may have begun in  the year 1903 on the [[Indiana University Bloomington]] campus, but there were too few registrants to assure continuing organization. In that year a club was formed called Alpha Kappa Nu Greek Club to "strengthen the black's voice", but the club disappeared after a short time. There is no record of any similar organization at Indiana University until Kappa Alpha Nu (now [[Kappa Alpha Psi]]) was issued a charter in 1911.<ref name=germantown>{{cite web |url=http://www.germantownalumni.org/fraternity |title=The History of Kappa Alpha Psi |publisher=Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, Germantown Alumni Chapter |accessdate=2006-04-26}}</ref>  Two of the founders of Kappa Alpha Psi had prior interaction with Alpha Phi Alpha and its Beta chapter while students at Howard University before transferring to Indiana University.<ref name=skip8>{{cite web |last=Mason |first=Herman "Skip" |date=1999-04-26 |url=http://www.skipmason.com/hm/hm08.htm |title=Revisionist Fraternities: The Omega, Kappa, Sigma Conspiracy |publisher=skipmason.com |accessdate=2006-05-05}}</ref>

The other BGLOs to come in succession with four additional being founded at Howard University, namely, [[Omega Psi Phi]] (1911), [[Delta Sigma Theta]] (1913), [[Phi Beta Sigma]] (1914) and [[Zeta Phi Beta]] (1920).  [[Sigma Gamma Rho]] (1922) and [[Iota Phi Theta Fraternity, Inc.|Iota Phi Theta]] (1963) were founded at [[Butler University]] and [[Morgan State University]] respectively.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nphchq.org/about.htm |title=National PanHellenic Council Aboutpage |publisher=NPHC |accessdate=2006-12-23}}</ref>      

{{Quote_box|width=38%|align=right|quote=First of All, Servants of All, <br/>We Shall Transcend All |source=Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity [[Motto]]|}}

Alpha Phi Alpha holds the historic position as the first intercollegiate Greek-letter fraternity in the United States established for people of African descent, and the [[wiktionary:paragon|paragon]] for the remaining BGLOs to follow.<ref name=munualphas/>  Historian Charles H. Wesley, a member of Alpha Phi Alpha, authored ''The History of Alpha Phi Alpha, A Development in College Life'' and asserts that Alpha Phi Alpha was the first Greek-letter organization among black college students.<ref>Wesley 1950, ''op. cit''.</ref>  The history books of Kappa Alpha Psi, Omega Psi Phi and Phi Beta Sigma omit the fraternity's place and contribution to the college Negro fraternal movement.  Historian and Alpha archivist Herman Mason has stated, "As a historian who recognizes that laying a foundation for any period of history, I find their omission inexcusable and without merit."<ref name=skip8/>
