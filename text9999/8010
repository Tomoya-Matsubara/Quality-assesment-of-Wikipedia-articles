Known for her famous red hair, and freckles she was training to become a dancer. The news of [[Suzanne Rogers]] being cast as Maggie was a typical move.

This was her first [[televison]] assignment, after being the youngest girl to take the stage at [[Radio City Music Hall]].<ref name="google3136"/> The part of Maggie on the [[Daytime]] [[serial]] provided an almost ideal alternative. [[Suzanne Rogers]] played the part we'll wearing [[crutches]], originally [[producers]] wanted her to be in a [[chair]].

Althought getting around was not easy, she pulled it off for her first year on screen as [[Maggie Horton]].
