The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) opened a [[civil rights]] investigation of the shooting on August 11, and the next day U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] issued a statement expressing condolences to Brown's family, also committing federal resources to conduct an investigation.

==Shooting==
The incident began around 2:00&nbsp;p.m. on August 9, 2014, in [[Ferguson, Missouri]], when Michael Brown, 18, and Dorian Johnson, 22, both African American men, were walking to Brown's grandmother's house.<ref name="LindVox" /><ref>{{Cite news|url = http://www.ibtimes.com/dorian-johnson-mike-brown-shooting-witness-meeting-fbi-county-prosecutor-1657892|title = Dorian Johnson, Mike Brown Shooting Witness, Meeting With FBI And County Prosecutor|last = Green|first = Treye|date = August 13, 2014|work = |accessdate = August 13, 2014}}</ref>  A Ferguson police officer drove up to the two men shortly after 2:00&nbsp;p.m. and ordered them off of the street and onto the sidewalk. After a gunshot was fired either in or from within the vehicle, Brown and Johnson then began to flee. The officer pursued the two men, then fired an as-of-yet unspecified number of shots, fatally wounding Brown. Brown's body was approximately {{convert|35|ft|m}} away from the cruiser when he died,<ref name="LindVox" /> and his body was not removed from the scene for an extended period of time. Johnson was not injured in the event. The Ferguson City Police Department has, as of August 13, 2014, declined to identify the officer involved in the shooting; he is currently on administrative leave.<ref name="cnnofficer" />

===St. Louis County Police account of events===


In a news conference held the day after the shooting, St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar stated, "The genesis of this was a physical confrontation...," during which Brown "physically assaulted the police officer."<ref name="KeslingWSJ" /> According to Belmar, the officer tried to exit his vehicle when Brown pushed him back into the car and allegedly assaulted the officer inside the car. Belmar also stated that Brown attempted to seize the officer's gun.  According to Belmar, during the struggle in the vehicle, at least one shot was fired. Police acknowledge that "more than a couple" of shots were fired, in the course of the encounter. <ref name="KeslingWSJ"/><ref name="McLaughlinCNN">{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/10/justice/missouri-police-involved-shooting/|title=Fatal police shooting in Missouri sparks protests|last=McLaughlin|first=Eliott C.|date=August 11, 2014|publisher=CNN|accessdate=August 11, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2014/08/10/michael_brown_unarmed_black_teenager_shot_in_ferguson_a_st_louis_suburb.html|title=Michael Brown: Unarmed black teenager shot in Ferguson, a St. Louis suburb.|last=Politi|first=Daniel|date=August 11, 2014|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|accessdate=August 11, 2014}}</ref>

====Dorian Johnson's account====
According to Dorian Johnson, who was walking with Brown at the time, the police officer pulled up beside them in his police cruiser and said, "Get the fuck on the sidewalk."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/video/data/2.0/video/us/2014/08/12/sot-dorian-johnson-michael-brown-shooting.kmov.html|title=Michael Brown's Friend [Dorian Johnson] Describes Shooting|last=Johnson|first=Dorian|date=September 8, 2014 |accessdate=August 13, 2014|publisher=CNN|type=Video interview}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/video/data/2.0/video/us/2014/08/12/ac-michael-brown-killed-thomas-jackson-intv.cnn.html|title=Violence Flares Again in Ferguson|date=August 11, 2014|accessdate=August 12, 2014|website=Violence Flares Again in Ferguson|publisher=CNN|last=Blitzer|first=Wolf}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Trymaine Lee |url=http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/eyewitness-michael-brown-fatal-shooting-missouri |title=Eyewitness to Michael Brown shooting recounts his friend's death |publisher=MSNBC |date=August 12, 2014 |accessdate=August 12, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Braden Goyette |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/12/michael-brown-shooting-witness_n_5671156.html |title=Lawyer: Police Haven't Talked To Michael Brown Shooting Witness |work=The Huffington Post |date=August 12, 2014 |accessdate=August 13, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url = http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/08/13/ferguson-missouri-teen-shooting-witness/13992387/|title = Witness to Michael Brown shooting comes forward|last = Farrah|first = Fazal|date = August 13, 2014|accessdate = August 13, 2014|last2 = |agency = |quote = "The officer is approaching us and as he pulled up on the side of us, he didn't say freeze, halt or anything like we were committing a crime. He said, 'Get the F on the sidewalk|at = Section 1, Paragraph 3|newspaper = USA Today}}</ref> The young men replied that they were "not but a minute away from [their] destination, and we would shortly be out of the street," Johnson said.

According to Johnson's account, the officer drove a short distance forward, stopped and then backed up, almost hitting the pair. Johnson recalled, "We were so close, almost inches away, that when he tried to open his door aggressively, the door ricocheted both off me and Big Mike's body and closed back on the officer." The officer, still in his car, grabbed Brown through the door by his neck. Brown tried to pull away, but the officer kept pulling Brown toward him. The officer drew his weapon, and "he said, 'I'll shoot you' or 'I'm going to shoot' " and almost instantaneously fired his weapon, hitting Brown.

Johnson told [[Chris Hayes]] of [[MSNBC]] that the claim by the St. Louis County Police that that Brown went for the officer's gun is wrong, that Brown "did not reach for the officer's weapon at all."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.riverfronttimes.com/dailyrft/2014/08/michael_brown_witness_dorian_johnson_why_police_have_not_interviewed_him.php |first=Jessica |last=Lussenhop |title=Why Police Haven't Interviewed Michael Brown Shooting Witness Dorian Johnson |work=Riverfront Times |location=St Louis |date=October 12 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/eyewitness-michael-brown-fatal-shooting-missouri|title=Eyewitness to Michael Brown shooting recounts his friend's death|date=December 8, 2014|publisher=MSNBC|accessdate=December 8, 2014}}</ref><ref name="FantzCNN">{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/11/us/missouri-teen-shooting/|title=Protesters fill streets after Michael Brown shooting|last=Fantz|first=Ashley|first2=George |last2=Howell|date=August 11, 2014|publisher=CNN|accessdate=August 11, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Alan Scher |last=Zagier |url=http://news.yahoo.com/missouri-crowd-shooting-kill-police-230624269.html |title=Missouri crowd after shooting: 'Kill the police' |agency=Associated Press |date=August 10, 2014 |accessdate=August 11, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/article_04e3885b-4131-5e49-b784-33cd3acbe7f1.html |title=Fatal shooting by Ferguson police draws angry crowd |newspaper=[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]] |date=August 9, 2014 |accessdate=August 11, 2014}}</ref>

The men ran, and then the officer shot Brown in the back. Brown turned, holding his hands in the air and said "I don't have a gun. Stop shooting!" The officer then shot him several more times.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/11/us/missouri-ferguson-michael-brown-what-we-know/index.html |first=Eliott C. |last=McLaughlin |title=What we know about the shooting of Michael Brown |publisher=CNN |date=August 13 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://time.com/3104128/michael-brown-ferguson-cop-shooting-protests/ |title=The Long, Tangled Roots of the Michael Brown Shooting |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=August 12, 2014 |accessdate=August 13, 2014 |last=Von Drehle |first=David}}</ref>

Multiple witnesses corroborate various elements of Johnson's account, denying, for example that Brown reached for the officer's gun, and supporting the claim that after being hit in the back while fleeing, Brown put his hands in the air to make clear that he had no weapon and as a gesture of surrender. 

====Tiffany Mitchell's account====
Another witness, Tiffany Mitchell, whose upper-level apartment is directly adjacent to the location of the shooting, said she heard the sound of tires screeching and came out of her apartment to see what was going on. Mitchell said  she witnessed the altercation between the police officer and Brown virtually from its inception. She stated that she was watching as the first gun shot was fired while the police officer, but not Brown, was still in the vehicle, at which point she went back into her apartment to get her cell phone in order to make a video recording of the unfolding event.<ref name=":0" />

Excerpts of Mitchell's video recording are shown in a report by St. Louis [[CBS]] television affiliate [[KMOV]], as part of a broadcast interview the station did with Mitchell. Mitchell's video shows both Brown's dead body and the police vehicle, positioned at about the distance estimated by the police during their Sunday press conference.  In the video, the empty vehicle is positioned diagonally across one lane of the two-lane road.<ref name=":0">{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Robin|title=Another witness to Brown shooting comes forward; video shows graphic scene|url=http://www.kmov.com/special-coverage-001/Another-witness-to-Michael-Brown-Jr-shooting-speaks-to-News-4-271139501.html |publisher=[[KMOV]]|accessdate=August 14, 2014}}</ref>

In an interview with St. Louis [[CBS]] television affiliate [[KMOV]], Mitchell stated that "After the shot, the kid just breaks away. The cop follows him, kept shooting, the kid's body jerked as if he was hit. After his body jerked he turns around, puts his hands up, and the cop continues to walk up on him and continues to shoot until he goes all the way down."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Robin|title=Another witness to Brown shooting comes forward; video shows graphic scene|url=http://www.kmov.com/special-coverage-001/Another-witness-to-Michael-Brown-Jr-shooting-speaks-to-News-4-271139501.html |publisher=[[KMOV]]|accessdate=August 14, 2014}}</ref>

====Piaget Crenshaw's account====
One witness, Piaget Crenshaw, stated it looked like the police officer and Brown were "arm wrestling"" before the officer initial shot Brown. Then the officer chased Brown for about 20 feet before shooting him again. When Brown then raised his arms in compliance, the officer shot him two more times.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-michael-brown-ferguson-missouri-shooting-20140811-story.html |title=Unrest in Ferguson, Mo., after police kill man: What you need to know |work=Los Angeles Times |date=August 13, 2014 |first=Lauren |last=Raab |accessdate=August 13, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Jon |last=Swaine |location=Ferguson |url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/12/michael-brown-shooting-ferguson-missouri-police-crack-down-protesters |title=Michael Brown shooting: police use teargas to crack down on protesters |work=The Guardian |date=September 17, 2010 |accessdate=August 13, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/14/us/missouri-teen-shooting/index.html |title=Witnesses to Michael Brown's shooting detail his last minutes |first1=Ben |last1=Brumfield |first2=Yon |last2=Pomrenze |publisher=CNN |date=August 14, 2014}}</ref>

According to ''[[The Washington Post]]'', the Ferguson Police Department "bears little demographic resemblance" to the mostly African-American community, which already harbored "suspicions of the law enforcement agency" preceding Brown's shooting. An annual report last year by the office of Missouri's attorney general concluded that Ferguson police were "twice as likely to arrest African Americans during traffic stops as they were whites."<ref name="ReferenceA"/>
