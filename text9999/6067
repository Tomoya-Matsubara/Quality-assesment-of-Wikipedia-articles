''' Sri Ragam ''' is an ancient raga in the [[Carnatic Music|Carnatic]] tradition. It seems unrelated to the [[Hindustani Classical Music|Hindustani]] [[Shree (raga)|Shree]]. Notably, it takes the lower madhyamam being a janya raga of Kharaharapriya. Sri Ragam is much beloved and is considered to be highly auspicious. Most notable among the compositions in this raga is Tyagaraja's Pancharatna Kriti [[Endaro Mahanubhavulu]] wherein the raga is depicted without the dhaivatam.

* Arohanam: Sa Ri Ma Pa Ni Sa
* Avarohanam: Sa Ni Pa Dha Ni Pa Ma Ri Ga Ri Sa
