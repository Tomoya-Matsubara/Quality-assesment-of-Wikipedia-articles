"'''Together Again'''" is a song by American recording artist [[Janet Jackson]] from her sixth studio album, ''[[The Velvet Rope]]'' (1997). It was written and produced by Jackson, [[Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis]], with additional writing by Jackson's then-husband, [[Ren<U+00E9> Elizondo, Jr.]] It was released as the second single from the album on December 2, 1997, through [[Virgin Records]]. Originally written as a [[ballad]], the track was rearranged as a [[dance music|dance]] and [[house music|house]] song. Jackson was reportedly inspired to write the song after a friend who succumbed to [[AIDS]], as well as a piece of fan mail she received from a young boy in England who had lost his father.

"Together Again" was well received by [[Music journalism|music critics]], who praised the song's structure and Jackson's vocals, comparing them to those of [[Diana Ross]] and works by [[Donna Summer]]. Commercially, the song was also successful, topping the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart for two weeks, as well as reaching the top of the [[Hot Dance Club Songs]]. The song was additionally certified Gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). "Together Again" attained commercial success worldwide, peaking within the top five in most countries, such as Canada and the United Kingdom, also topping the charts in Denmark and Netherlands.

Two [[music video]]s were produced for "Together Again". The video for the original version was directed by Seb Janiak, and shows Jackson and her dancers performing in a futuristic African paradise where people are seen living side by side with wild animals such as [[elephant]]s, [[giraffe]]s, and [[wildcat]]s. Another music video released for the 'Deeper Remix' was directed by Ren<U+00E9> Elizondo, Jr. and shows Jackson in an apartment. Jackson performed "Together Again" in a number of occasions to promote ''The Velvet Rope'', including at the [[American Music Awards]]. She has performed the song on all of her tours since its release.

==Background==
"Together Again" was written as a tribute from Jackson to a friend who had recently died from [[AIDS]] as well as AIDS victims and their families worldwide, as stated in the liner notes of ''[[The Velvet Rope]]'' (1997). Originally written as a [[ballad]], the track was re-arranged as a [[dance music|dance]] and [[house music|house]] song. Jackson was reportedly inspired to write the song from her own personal experience, as well as a piece of fan-mail she received from a young boy in England who had lost his father.<ref name="Jacksons Number Ones">{{cite book|last=Halstead|first=Craig|coauthors=Chris Cadman|title=Jacksons Number Ones|publisher=Authors On Line|year=2003|pages=119, 120|url=http://books.google.com/?id=tynOwh1E_GAC|isbn=0-7552-0098-5}}</ref> According to Jimmy Jam, "it had a deep meaning for her because it was about a friend she lost to AIDS, but as with all her songs, she tries to make them apply in a general sense to anybody. The idea was to make it a joyous song musically".<ref name="The Inside Story">{{cite book  | last = Bronson| first =  Fred | title = The Billboard Book of Number One Hits | publisher = Billboard Books | year = 2003 | url = http://books.google.com/?id=PgGqNrqfrsoC | isbn = 0-8230-7677-6 | page = 862}}</ref> The arrangement of the song was constructed in 30 minutes by Jam, Lewis and Jackson while in the recording studio. Once the melody was in place, Jackson finished writing the lyrics to the song. The song's sound was inspired by [[Donna Summer]]'s song "[[Last Dance (song)|Last Dance]]".<ref name="The Inside Story"/> Jackson told [[MTV News]] that about her inspiration to write "Together Again" was "Runaway" by [[Masters at Work|Nuyorican Soul]], as the song reminded her of her young day in [[Studio 54]] in New York. "Runaway" gave Jackson a kind of New York feel of [[disco music]] and she wanted to do something like this.<ref name=mean>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1430424/janet-jackson-discusses-the-meaning-of-the-velvet-rope-pt-ii/#|title=Janet Jackson Discusses The Meaning Of <U+201C>The Velvet Rope,<U+201D> Pt.
