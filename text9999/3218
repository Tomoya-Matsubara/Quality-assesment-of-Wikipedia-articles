was a powerful and destructive [[tropical cyclone]] that struck the [[Philippines]] in August&nbsp;1987. The seventh [[typhoon]] and second super typhoon of the active [[typhoon season]], it formed from the [[monsoon trough]] that spawned a tropical cyclone on August 8 while around positioned well to the east of the Philippines. It drifted northwestward, becoming a tropical storm on August&nbsp;9 and a typhoon on August&nbsp;10. Betty turned westward, where it rapidly intensified before attaining peak intensity on August&nbsp;11. The next day, Typhoon Betty made [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] in the central Philippines. Betty weakened rapidly over the country, but restrengthened somewhat over the South China Sea. Land interaction weakened Betty slightly before it hit central [[Vietnam]] on August&nbsp;16. The next day, Betty dissipated.

Across the Philippines, Typhoon Betty brought widespread flooding, which resulted in severe destruction. Damage added up to $100&nbsp;million (1987&nbsp;[[United States Dollar|USD]]). In the [[Maguindanao]] and [[Albay]] provinces alone, 10,000&nbsp;people were evacuated and 1,000&nbsp;were homeless. However, the capital city of [[Manila]] avoided any serious damage. Nation-wide, around 200,000&nbsp;people were reportedly homeless, 18,000&nbsp;of winch were from [[Marinduque]] and another 11,400&nbsp;resided on [[Mindoro Island]]. In the former, 4,000&nbsp;dwellings sustained damage, and all of the banana crop there was lost. In all, 25,518&nbsp;homes received damage. Roughly 400,000&nbsp;people were directly affected by the storm. Overall, 85&nbsp;people were killed and 324&nbsp;others were wounded. After striking the Philippines, six people were killed by Betty in Vietnam. Approximately 10,000&nbsp;structures were damaged and 103&nbsp;people were injured. Elsewhere, in northern Thailand, one person was killed and three others were hurt by the typhoon. Several villages were flooded, and numerous streets were damaged.

==Meteorological history==
{{Storm path|Betty 1987 track.png}}
The origins of Typhoon Betty can be traced back to a tropical disturbance that was embedded in the [[monsoon trough]] on August 7, which extended from the [[Marshall Islands]] westward to the [[Philippines]]. Intensity estimates via the [[Dvorak technique]] yielded winds of {{convert|50|km/h|mph|abbr=on|disp=5}} around {{convert|65|km|mi|abbr=on}} north-northwest of Belau in the western [[Caroline Islands]]. Following a rapid increase in organization, the [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]] (JTWC) issued a [[Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert]] (TCFA) for the system early on August&nbsp;8.<ref name="JTWC ATCR">{{cite report|title=Annual Tropical Cyclone Report: 1987|publisher=United States Navy, United States Air Force|url=http://www.usno.navy.mil/NOOC/nmfc-ph/RSS/jtwc/atcr/1987atcr.pdf|author2=Naval Pacific Meteorology and Oceanography Center|author=Joint Typhoon Warning Center|accessdate=June 13, 2014|year=1988}}</ref> Meanwhile, the [[Japan Meteorological Agency]] (JMA) started tracking the system.<ref name="JMA">{{cite report|author=Japan Meteorological Agency|date=October 10, 1992|title=RSMC Best Track Data &ndash; 1980&ndash;1989|accessdate=June 13, 2014|url=http://www.jma.go.jp/jma/jma-eng/jma-center/rsmc-hp-pub-eg/Besttracks/bst8089.txt|format=[[.TXT]]}}</ref>{{#tag:ref|The [[Japan Meteorological Agency]] is the official [[Regional Specialized Meteorological Center]] for the western Pacific Ocean.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Japan Meteorological Agency|title=Annual Report on Activities of the RSMC Tokyo &ndash; Typhoon Center 2000|date=February 2001|accessdate=June 13, 2014|url=http://www.jma.go.jp/jma/jma-eng/jma-center/rsmc-hp-pub-eg/AnnualReport/2000/Text/Text2000.pdf|page=3|format=[[PDF]]}}</ref>|group="nb"}} Around this time, the [[Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration]] also monitored the storm and [[Tropical cyclone naming|assigned it with the local name]] ''Herming''.<ref name="T2000">{{cite web|url=http://www.typhoon2000.ph/stormstats/1963-1988_PTC.txt|title=PAGASA Tropical Cyclone Names 1963<U+2013>1988|author=Michael V.

Betty continued to intensify, and by midday, the storm attained winds of {{convert|80|km/h|mph|abbr=on|disp=5}}.<ref name="IBTRACS"/> By the evening of August 9, the JMA upgraded Betty to a [[tropical cyclone scales|severe tropical storm]].<ref name="JMA"/> At 0000&nbsp;UTC on August&nbsp;10, both the JMA and JTWC believed that Betty attained typhoon intensity.<ref name="IBTRACS"/> Tracking westward Betty began an episode of [[rapid deepening|explosive deepening]] as expected by the JTWC.<ref name="JTWC ATCR"/> At noon, the JTWC reported that Betty attained winds of {{Convert|160|km/h|mph|abbr=on|disp-5}}, equivalent to a Category 2 hurricane on the United States [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale]] (SSHWS). By 0000&nbsp;UTC on August&nbsp;11, the agency upgraded Betty to an equivalent of a Category 4 hurricane.<ref name="IBTRACS"/> Later that day, the JMA estimated that Betty attained its peak [[maximum sustained wind]] of {{convert|190|km/h|mph|disp=5|abbr=on}} and a minimum [[barometric pressure]] of {{Convert|890|mbar|inHg|abbr=on}}. However, the JTWC indicated that the system was considerably stronger, with maximum sustained winds of 260&nbsp;km/h (160&nbsp;mph). This concluded the storm intensification period; according to the JTWC, Betty strengthened {{convert|93|mbar|inHg|abbr=on}} in a 37 hour time frame.<ref name="JTWC ATCR"/> Furthermore, Betty was the deepest storm of the season,<ref name="JMA"/> and [[list of the most intense tropical cyclones|one of the most powerful storms]] ever recorded.<ref name="JTWC ATCR"/>

At peak, which it maintained for 12&nbsp;hours,<ref name="IBTRACS"/> Betty exhibited a small but well-defined [[eye (cyclone)|eye]] surrounded by very cold cloud tops.<ref name="JTWC ATCR"/> Thereafter, Betty began to weaken as it moved over the central [[Philippines]]. Accelerating, Betty continued on a westward track while passing south of a [[subtropical ridge]]. According to the JTWC, winds quickly decreased to {{convert|190|km/h|mph|disp=5|abbr=on}}, and by the time it emerged into the [[South China Sea]] early on August&nbsp;13, the typhoon's winds had diminished to {{convert|180|km/h|mph|disp=5|abbr=on}}, equivalent to a high-end Category 2 on the SSHWS.<ref name="JTWC ATCR"/> The JMA estimated that Betty was slightly weaker, with winds of {{convert|170|km/h|mph|abbr=on|disp=5}}.<ref name="JMA"/> Moving west-northwest, Betty began to deepen over open water.<ref name="JTWC ATCR"/> By midday, the JMA increased the intensity of Typhoon Betty to {{Convert|110|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}.<ref name="JMA"/> On the morning of August 14, the JTWC remarked that Betty reached its secondary peak intensity of {{Convert|210|km/h|mph|abbr=on|disp=5}}.<ref name="JTWC ATCR"/> Despite this, intensity estimates from the JMA note that Betty did not intensify any further.<ref name="JMA"/>

After attaining its secondary peak intensity, Betty began to deteriorate as it began to interact with Vietnam. After entering the [[Gulf of Tonkin]], Betty made [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] {{convert|350|km|mi|abbr=on|disp=5}} south of [[Hanoi]] in northern Vietnam on August&nbsp;16.<ref name="JTWC ATCR"/> At the time of landfall, the JMA estimated winds of {{convert|135|km/h|mph|abbr=on|disp=5}} and the JTWC estimated winds of {{convert|140|km/h|mph|abbr=on|disp=5}}.<ref name="IBTRACS"/> According to the JMA, Betty weakened to a tropical storm on evening of August&nbsp;16.<ref name="JMA"/> It then swept across [[Laos]] and eventually dissipated over northern [[Thailand]] near [[Chiang Mai]] during the evening of August&nbsp;17.<ref name="HKO">{{cite web|title=Tropical Cyclones of the 1987 Pacific Typhoon Season|url=http://www.hko.gov.hk/publica/tc/tc1987.pdf|publisher=[[Hong Kong Royal Observatory]]|accessdate=June 13, 2014}}</ref>
