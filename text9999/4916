'''Arthur James Balfour, 1st Earl of Balfour''', [[Order of the Garter|KG]], [[Order of Merit|OM]], [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|PC]], ([[25 July]] [[1848]]-[[19 March]] [[1930]]) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] politician and statesman, and [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] from [[1902]] to [[1905]]. The author of several influential works of philosophy, he was one of the more intellectual prime ministers of the [[20th Century]]. As [[Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs|Foreign Minister of the United Kingdom]], he authored the [[Balfour Declaration]] of [[1917]], which supported the establishment of a [[Zionism|homeland]] for the [[Jewish people]] in [[Palestine]]. He was a member and president (1892-94) of the [[Society for Psychical Research]], a society dedicated to studying [[psychic]] and [[paranormal phenomena]].

==Background and early career==
Arthur Balfour was born at [[Whittingehame]], and was the eldest son of [[James Maitland Balfour]] (1820-1856) of [[East Lothian]], [[Scotland]], and [[Lady Blanche Gascoyne-Cecil]] (d. 1872, aged forty-seven). His father was an MP; his mother, a member of the Cecil family descended from [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury]], was the daughter of the [[James Gascoyne-Cecil, 2nd Marquess of Salisbury|2nd Marquess of Salisbury]] and a sister to the [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|3d Marquess]], the future Prime Minister. He was the eldest son, the third of eight children, and had four brothers and three sisters. Arthur Balfour was educated at [[Eton College|Eton]] (1861-1866) where he studied with the influential Master [[William Johnson Cory]], and [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] (1866-1869), where he received a [[British undergraduate degree classification|Second-Class Honours]] Degree. His younger brother was the renowned Cambridge embryologist [[Francis Maitland Balfour]] (1851-1882).

Distraught at the early death from [[typhus]] in 1875 of his cousin May Lyttleton, whom he had hoped to marry, Balfour remained a bachelor throughout his life, his serious intention to marry never renewed. His household was maintained by his (also) unmarried sister Alice. In middle age Balfour had a long friendship with Mary Wemyss, later Countess of Elcho. It is unclear whether the relationship was physical.

In 1874 he was elected [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Hertford]] and represented that constituency until 1885. In the spring of 1878 Balfour became [[Parliamentary Private Secretary|Private Secretary]] to his uncle, [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]]. In that capacity he accompanied Salisbury (then Foreign Secretary) to the [[Congress of Berlin]] and gained his first experience in international politics in connection with the settlement of the Russo-Turkish conflict. At the same time he became known in the world of letters; the academic subtlety and literary achievement of his ''Defence of Philosophic Doubt'' (1879) suggested that he might make a reputation for himself as a philosopher.

Balfour divided his time between the political arena and the academy. Released from his duties as private secretary by the general election of 1880, he began to take a more active part in parliamentary affairs. He was for a time politically associated with [[Lord Randolph Churchill]], [[Henry Drummond Wolff|Sir Henry Drummond Wolff]] and [[John Eldon Gorst|John Gorst]]. This quartet became known as the "Fourth Party" and gained notoriety for the leader Lord Randolph Churchill's free criticism of [[Stafford Northcote, 1st Earl of Iddesleigh|Sir Stafford Northcote]], [[R. A. Cross, 1st Viscount Cross|Lord Cross]] and other prominent members of the "old gang".

==Service in Lord Salisbury's governments==
Lord Salisbury made Balfour [[President of the Local Government Board]] in 1885 and later [[Secretary for Scotland]] in 1886, with a seat in the cabinet. These offices, while having few opportunities for distinction, served as a sort of apprenticeship for Balfour. In early 1887 Sir [[Michael Hicks-Beach]], the [[Chief Secretary for Ireland]], resigned because of illness and Salisbury appointed his nephew in his place. The selection took the political world by surprise and possibly led to the British phrase "Bob's your uncle!". Balfour surprised his critics by his ruthless enforcement of the Crimes Act, earning the nickname "Bloody Balfour". Balfour's skill for steady administration did much to dispel his reputation as a political lightweight.

In Parliament he resisted any overtures to the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] on [[Home Rule]], and, allied with [[Joseph Chamberlain]]'s [[Liberal Unionist]]s, strongly encouraged [[Unionists (Ireland)|Unionist]] activism in Ireland. Balfour also broadened the basis of material prosperity to the less well off by creating the [[Congested Districts Board]] in 1890. It was during this period of 1886-1892 that he sharpened his gift of oratory and gained a reputation as one of the most effective public speakers of the age. Impressive in matter rather than in delivery, his speeches were logical and convincing, and delighted an ever wider audience.

On the death of [[William Henry Smith (politician)|W.H. Smith]] in 1891, Balfour became [[First Lord of the Treasury]] and [[Leader of the House of Commons]]. After the fall of the government in 1892 he spent three years as [[Leader of the Opposition (UK)|Leader of the Opposition]]. On the return of the Conservatives to power in 1895, he resumed the leadership of the House. His management of the abortive education proposals of 1896 were thought to show a disinclination for the continuous drudgery of parliamentary management. Yet he had the satisfaction of seeing a bill pass providing Ireland with an improved system of local government, and took an active role in the debates on the various foreign and domestic questions that came before parliament between 1895 to 1900.

During the illness of Lord Salisbury in 1898, and again in Lord Salisbury's absence abroad, Balfour was put in charge of the [[Foreign Office]], and it was his job to conduct the critical negotiations with Russia on the question of railways in North China. As a member of the cabinet responsible for the [[Second Boer War|Transvaal negotiations]] in 1899, he bore his full share of controversy, and when the [[Second Boer War|war]] began disastrously, he was the first to realize the need to put the full military strength of the country into the field. His leadership of the House of Commons was marked by considerable firmness in the suppression of obstruction, yet there was a slight revival of the criticisms of 1896. However, it should be noted that Balfour's inability to get the maximum amount of work out of the House was largely due to the situation in [[South Africa]], a crisis that absorbed the intellectual energies of the House and of the United Kingdom as a whole.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

==Prime Minister==
On Lord Salisbury's resignation on [[11 July]] [[1902]], Balfour succeeded him as Prime Minister, with the approval of all sections of the Unionist party. The new Prime Minister came into power practically at the same moment as the coronation of [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Edward VII]] and the end of the [[South African War]]. For a while no cloud appeared on the horizon. The Liberal party was still disorganized over their attitude towards the Boers. The two chief items of the ministerial parliamentary program were the extension of the new Education Act to London and the Irish Land Purchase Act, by which the British exchequer would advance the capital for enabling tenants in Ireland to buy land. A notable achievement of Balfour's government was the establishment of the [[Committee on Imperial Defence]].

The budget was certain to show a surplus and taxation could be remitted. Yet as events proved, it was the budget that would sow dissension, override all other legislative concerns, and in the end signal the beginning of a new political movement. [[Charles Thomson Ritchie]]'s remission of the shilling import-duty on corn led to [[Joseph Chamberlain]]'s crusade in favour of tariff reform <U+2014> these were taxes on imported goods with trade preference given to the Empire, with the threefold goal of protecting British industry from competition, strengthening the British Empire in the face of growing German and American economic power, and providing a source of revenue, other than raising taxes, for the costs of social welfare legislation. As the session proceeded, the rift grew in the Unionist ranks. Tariff Reform proved popular with Unionist supporters, but the threat of higher prices for food imports made the policy an electoral albatross.

The debate over [[Imperial Preference]] and the subsequent split of the Conservative-Unionist Party dominated the three years of Balfour's premiership. With Balfour's agreement, Chamberlain resigned from the Cabinet (although his son Austen replaced Ritchie as Chancellor of the Exchequer) to stump the country in favour of Tariff Reform. At the same time, Balfour tried to balance the two factions by accepting the resignation of three free-trading ministers, but the almost simultaneous resignation of the free-trader Duke of Devonshire (who as Lord Hartington had been the Liberal Unionist leader of the 1880s) left Balfour's Cabinet looking weak. By 1905 relatively few Unionist MPs were still free traders (the young Winston Churchill crossed over to the Liberals in 1904 when threatened with deselection at Oldham), but Balfour's long balancing act had drained his authority within the government.

Balfour eventually resigned as Prime Minister in December of 1905, hoping in vain that the Liberal leader Campbell-Bannerman would be unable to form a strong government. These hopes were dashed when Campbell-Bannerman faced down an attempt (the "Relugas Compact") to "kick him upstairs" to the House of Lords. The Conservatives were defeated by the Liberals at the general election the following January (in terms of MPs, a Liberal landslide), with Balfour himself losing his seat at [[Manchester East (UK Parliament constituency)|Manchester East]]. Only 157 Conservatives were returned to the House of Commons, at least two-thirds of them followers of Chamberlain, who briefly chaired the Conservative MPs until Balfour won another seat.

==Later career==
After the [[United Kingdom general election, 1906|disaster of 1906]] Balfour remained party leader, his position strengthened by Joseph Chamberlain's removal from active politics after his stroke in July 1906, but he was unable to make much headway against the huge Liberal majority in the House of Commons. An early attempt to score a debating triumph over the government saw Campbell-Bannerman respond with: "Enough of this foolery". Balfour made the controversial decision, with [[Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, 5th Marquess of Lansdowne|Lord Lansdowne]], to use the heavily Unionist [[House of Lords]] as an active check on the political program and legislation of the Liberal party in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]]. Numerous pieces of legislation were vetoed or altered by amendments between 1906 and 1909, leading [[David Lloyd George]] to remark that the Lords had become "not the watchdog of the Constitution, but Mr. Balfour's poodle." The issue was eventually forced by the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberals]] with Lloyd George's so-called [[People's Budget]], provoking the constitutional crisis that eventually led to the [[Parliament Act]] of 1911, which replaced the Lords' veto authority with a greatly reduced power to only delay bills for up to two years. After the Unionists had failed to win an electoral mandate at either of the General Elections of 1910 (despite softening the Tariff Reform policy with Balfour's promise of a referendum on food taxes), the Unionist peers split to allow the Parliament Act to pass the House of Lords, in order to prevent a mass-creation of new Liberal peers by the new King, George V. The exhausted Balfour resigned as party leader after the crisis, and was succeeded by [[Andrew Bonar Law]].

Balfour remained an important figure within the party, however, and when the Unionists joined [[H. H. Asquith|Asquith]]'s coalition government in May 1915, Balfour succeeded [[Winston Churchill]] as [[First Lord of the Admiralty]]. When Asquith's government collapsed in December 1916, Balfour became [[Foreign Secretary]] in Lloyd George's new administration, but was not actually included in the small War Cabinet, and was frequently left out of the inner workings of the government. Balfour's service as Foreign Secretary was most notable for the issuance of the [[Balfour Declaration, 1917|Balfour Declaration]] of 1917, a letter to Lord Rothschild promising the Jews a "national home" in [[Palestine]], then part of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. 

Balfour resigned as Foreign Secretary following the [[Treaty of Versailles|Versailles Conference]] in 1919, but continued on in the government (and the Cabinet after normal peacetime political arrangements resumed) as [[Lord President of the Council]].  In 1921-22 he represented the British Empire at the [[Washington Naval Conference]].

In 1922 he, along with most of the Conservative leadership, resigned with Lloyd George's government following the Conservative back-bench revolt against the continuance of the coalition. Bonar Law soon became Prime Minister. In 1922 Balfour was created [[Earl of Balfour]]. Like many of the Coalition leaders he did not hold office in the Conservative governments of 1922-4, although as an elder statesman he was consulted in the choice of Baldwin as Bonar Law's successor as Conservative leader in May 1923. When asked by a lady whether "dear George" (the much more experienced Lord Curzon) would be chosen, he is said to have replied "No, dear George will not."

Balfour was again not initially included in [[Stanley Baldwin]]'s second government in 1924, but in 1925 he once again returned to the Cabinet, serving in place of the late Lord Curzon as [[Lord President of the Council]] until the government ended in 1929.

Apart from a number of colds and occasional [[influenza]], Balfour had enjoyed good health until the year 1928. He remained until then a regular tennis player. At the end of that year most of his teeth had to be removed and he began to suffer from the unremitting circulatory trouble which ended his life. Late in January 1929 Balfour was conveyed from Whittingehame to Fisher's Hill, his brother Gerald's home near [[Woking]], [[Surrey]]. In the past he had suffered from occasional bouts of [[phlebitis]] and by the autumn of 1929 he was immobilized by it. Finally, soon after receiving a visit from his friend [[Chaim Weizmann]], Balfour died at Fisher's Hill on 19 March 1930. At his own request a public funeral was declined and he was buried on 22 March beside members of his family at [[Whittingehame]]. Despite the snowy weather, attenders came from far and wide. By special remainder, the title passed to his brother Gerald.

Lord Balfour's estate was probated <U+00A3>76,433 5''s.'' 2''d.'' on [[August 27]], [[1930]].

==Writings and academic achievements==
Balfour's writings include:
* ''Essays and Addresses'' (1893).
* ''The Foundations of Belief, being Notes introductory to the Study of Theology'' (1895).
* ''Questionings on Criticism and Beauty'' (Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1909), based on his 1909 [[Romanes Lecture]].
* ''Theism and Humanism'' (1915), based on his first series of [[Gifford Lectures]] given in 1914 and is still in print. In 1962, Oxford writer [[C. S. Lewis]] told ''[[Christian Century]]'' that ''Theism and Humanism'' was one of the ten books that most influenced his thought.
* ''Theism and Thought'' (1923) based on the second in his [[Gifford Lectures]], which were given in 1922.

He was made LL.D. of the [[University of Edinburgh]] in 1881; of the [[University of St Andrews]] in 1885; of [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] in 1888; of Dublin and Glasgow Universities in 1891; Lord Rector of [[St Andrews University]] in 1886; of Glasgow University in 1890; Chancellor of Edinburgh University in 1891; member of the senate London University in 1888; and DCL of Oxford University in 1891. He was president of the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]] in 1904, and became a fellow of the [[Royal Society]] in 1888. He was known from early life as a cultured musician, and became an enthusiastic golf player, having been captain of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews in 1894-1895. He was president of the [[Aristotelian Society]] from 1914 to 1915.
