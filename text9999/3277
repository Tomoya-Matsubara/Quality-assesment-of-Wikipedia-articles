[[Image:Potomac Aqueduct Bridge (canal).JPG|thumb|First Aqueduct Bridge between 1860 and 1865.]]
The '''Aqueduct Bridge''' (also called the '''Alexandria Aqueduct''') was a bridge between [[Georgetown, Washington, D.C.]], and [[Rosslyn, Virginia]].  It was built to transport cargo-carrying boats on the [[Chesapeake and Ohio Canal]] in Georgetown across the [[Potomac River]] to the [[Alexandria Canal (Virginia)|Alexandria Canal]].  The same eight [[pier (architecture)| piers]] supported two different bridges: a wooden [[water bridge|canal bridge]] (a wooden roadway bridge was added on top of the canal later), and a roadway-only [[iron]] [[truss bridge]].  The bridge was closed in 1923 after the construction of the nearby [[Francis Scott Key Bridge (Washington)|Key Bridge]]. The shuttered Aqueduct Bridge was demolished in 1933.

==History==
===First bridge===
[[File:Aqueduct Bridge - c 1900 - Washington DC.jpg|thumb|First Aqueduct Bridge after addition of superstructure and roadway. Note the Howe trusses and arches added for strength.]]
In 1830, merchants from [[Alexandria, Virginia]], which was still part of the District of Columbia at the time, proposed linking their city to Georgetown to capitalize on the new Chesapeake and Ohio Canal.<ref>Gillette, p. 18.</ref>  Congress granted a charter to the Alexandria Canal Company in 1830,<ref>Hurst, p. 4-5.</ref> and construction soon began on the Aqueduct Bridge that would carry canal boats across the [[Potomac River]] and downriver on the south side without unloading in Georgetown.  The bridge was designed by Major William Turnbull.<ref name="Kapsch">Kapsch, p. 136.</ref>  Construction of the bridge and Alexandria Canal began in 1833, and both were completed in 1843.<ref name="Kapsch" />  To withstand Potomac [[ice floe]]s, the piers were made of [[gneiss]], with icebreakers made of [[granite]].<ref name="Appendix">[http://books.google.com/books?id=56EEAAAAYAAJ&dq=%22Aqueduct%20Bridge%22%20gneiss&pg=PA3641#v=onepage&q&f=false "Appendix B B B - Bridges at Washington, D.C.", p. 3641.] Accessed 2012-12-29.</ref> The water-filled bridge was a weatherproofed-timber, [[queen-post]] truss construction.<ref name="Reed">Reed, p. 144.</ref> The bridge was {{convert|110|ft|m|1}} wide across the top. It had eight piers, each set on riverbottom bedrock and {{convert|7|ft|m|1}} wide at the top. The third and sixth piers were {{convert|16|ft|m|1}} wide at the top. Each pier was designed so that its top was {{convert|30|ft|m|1}} above the mean high water level.<ref name="Appendix" />

During the [[American Civil War]], the canal was drained to make a roadway for military troops.<ref name="Reed" />

In 1866, the Alexandria Canal Company leased the bridge for 99 years to three local businessmen. The existing wooden superstructure, which had decayed, was replaced with [[Truss bridge#Howe truss|Howe trusses]]. Wooden arches were later added to strengthen the Howe trusses. In 1868, Congress passed legislation requiring the lessees of the bridge to maintain a highway on the bridge. To support this construction, the lessees were authorized to charge a toll.  A wooden floor was placed atop the Howe trusses, and wooden [[trestle]]s built on both ends to provide approaches to the bridge.<ref name="Appendix" />

===Second bridge===
In the 1882, legislation was introduced in Congress to purchase the Aqueduct Bridge and open it to the public.<ref>"The Aqueduct Bridge." ''Washington Post.'' December 7, 1882.</ref> But the bill did not pass. Legislation was again introduced in January 1884.<ref>"Free Bridge Across the Potomac." ''Washington Post.'' January 10, 1884.</ref> This legislation was ultimately successful. At issue, however, was who would bear the cost of buying the bridge. Congress initially proposed that the District of Columbia shoulder the entire cost, but the city did not have the funds.<ref>"The Proposed Free Bridge." ''Washington Post.'' February 19, 1884.</ref> Citizens in Virginia demanded that Congress pick up cost, arguing this was an interstate bridge and therefore a national concern.<ref>"Proposed Free Bridge." ''Washington Post.'' March 17, 1884.</ref> Congress passed the legislation, and appropriated $240,000 to purchase the bridge. The Alexandria Canal Company sold the bridge's piers for $85,000 and its deck for $50,000, and the deed was conveyed to the federal government on August 15, 1884.<ref>"The Aqueduct Bridge." ''Washington Post.'' August 16, 1884.</ref> Almost immediately, a dispute broke out among the canal company's shareholders as to the distribution of the funds, which suspended the transfer of deed.<ref>"The Bridge Dispute." ''Washington Post.'' October 13, 1886.</ref>

Almost immediately, however, the safety of the bridge was called into question. In December 1885, just a year after the bridge was purchased, the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] conducted a study that found the wooden bridge so unsafe that it should be removed.<ref>"Two District Bridges." ''Washington Post.'' December 24, 1885.</ref> Again, cost considerations came to the fore. Legislation was introduced in Congress in May 1886 to have a new bridge built, with the D.C. government picking up half the cost.<ref>"The Free Bridge Conference." ''Washington Post.'' May 28, 1886; "Our Free Bridge." ''Washington Post.'' May 29, 1886.</ref> A D.C. engineering study of the bridge was conducted in September 1886 to again determine the bridge's safety. This report for the bridge so unsafe that it recommended immediate closure.<ref>"The Aqueduct Bridge Unsafe." ''Washington Post.'' September 26, 1886.</ref> The District government did so on October 5, 1886.<ref>"The Aqueduct Bridge." ''Washington Post.'' October 4, 1886; "The Bridge to Be Closed." ''Washington Post.'' October 5, 1886.</ref>

[[File:Potomac Aqueduct Bridge (road).jpg|thumb|Second Aqueduct Bridge, some time between 1924 and 1933.]]
On October 20, 1886, the canal company shareholders finally settled on how to distribute the purchase funds amongst themselves. The District government then asked the [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] (who supervised the Corps of Engineers) whether the federal government intended to report the bridge or build a new one.<ref>"The Bridge Question." ''Washington Post.'' October 21, 1886.</ref> But issues concerning the sale still plagued the bridge. Although a new deed of transfer was prepared in mid-November 1886,<ref>"The Aqueduct Bridge." ''Washington Post.'' November 13, 1886.</ref> the Alexandria Canal Company sued the federal government in December 1886 to receive the full sale price all at once (rather than in installments).<ref>"The Aqueduct Bridge." ''Washington Post.'' December 22, 1886.</ref> Another Corps engineering report on the bridge was made in January 1887.<ref>"The Aqueduct Bridge Examination." ''Washington Post.'' January 7, 1887.</ref> With the bridge again found to be unsafe to open, the federal government sued the canal company. The deed of sale, the government said, required the company to maintain a bridge that is open to travel for 20 years. This condition had not been met, and the government sought $84,500 in reimbursements to cover construction of a new deck.<ref>"The Aqueduct Bridge." ''Washington Post.'' January 8, 1887.</ref>

Meanwhile, the Corps of Engineers reported in January 1887 that a new bridge could be constructed for $105,000 (the sum of money left over from the 1884 appropriation).<ref>"A New Aqueduct Bridge." ''Washington Post.'' January 16, 1887.</ref> With this money already in hand, no new legislation was needed. Bids for construction of the new bridge were received in March 1887,<ref>"Bids for Important Work." ''Washington Post.'' March 8, 1887.</ref> and a contract awarded to the Mt. Vernon Bridge Company.<ref>"The Aqueduct Bridge." ''Washington Post.'' March 24, 1887.</ref> Work began in August.<ref>"Work on the Aqueduct Bridge." ''Washington Post.'' August 13, 1887.</ref> But extensive delays plagued the bridge.<ref>"The New Aqueduct Bridge." ''Washington Post.'' November 28, 1887.</ref> One reason for the delay was the need to obtain a new right-of-way from the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, which the bridge would cross.<ref>"The New Aqueduct Bridge." ''Washington Post.'' December 8, 1887.</ref> Suit for the right-of-way was filed in December 1887, and the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal agreed to provide it (pending an appraisal) in January 1888.<ref>"The Aqueduct Bridge." ''Washington Post.'' January 6, 1888.</ref> But work continued to be slow due to inefficient work practices by the contractor, delaying the opening until at least January 1889.<ref>"Work on the Bridges." ''Washington Post.'' January 11, 1888.</ref> A month later, about {{convert|600|ft|m|0}} of substructure had been laid, and {{convert|75|ft|m|0}} of superstructure.<ref>"Work on the Bridges." ''Washington Post.'' February 10, 1888.</ref> Construction problems delayed the opening of the bridge until June 1, 1889.<ref>"On the Free Bridge." ''Washington Post.'' June 2, 1889.</ref>

In 1889, the northern arch in the Washington abutment was enlarged so that the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad#Branches|Georgetown Branch]] of the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] could pass underneath.  When that line was abandoned, Water Street NW was extended west through the passageway to the Washington Canoe Club.  The empty lot before the canoe club had previously been occupied by Dempsey's Canoe Livery.  The rest of the Georgetown Branch [[right-of-way (railroad)|right-of-way]] is now occupied by the [[Capital Crescent Trail]]. One of the piers was replaced in 1900.<ref>"At Work in River Bed." ''Washington Post.'' September 3, 1900.</ref>

==Building Key Bridge==
Proposals were made to replace Aqueduct Bridge as early as 1901.<ref>"Plans for New Bridge." ''Washington Post.'' February 7, 1901.</ref> But these proposals were delayed when the [[McMillan Plan]] was issued in 1902.<ref>"Aqueduct Bill Report." ''Washington Post.'' March 8, 1902.</ref> Congress approved the construction of a wooden [[superstructure]] that extended outward from the upstream side of the bridge's [[Deck (building)|deck]] to carry [[tram| electric trolleys]] between Georgetown and Rosslyn in 1902.<ref>"Bridge Plans Held Up." ''Washington Post.'' February 27, 1903; "Tracks on Aqueduct Bridge." ''Washington Post.'' March 1, 1903.</ref> Construction began in May 1903, and involved reconstruction of one of the bridge's piers.<ref>"Contract for Bridge Pier." ''Washington Post.'' April 12, 1903; "Delay on Aqueduct Bridge." ''Washington Post.'' July 17, 1904.</ref> Built by the [[Great Falls and Old Dominion Railroad]], trolleys of the railroad and its successor, the [[Washington and Old Dominion Railroad| Washington and Old Dominion Railway]], traversed the bridge until its closure in 1923.

Terrible ice jams were a routine hazard on the Potomac River into the 1960s. Although the jams often stuck against the bridge, it weathered them well until 1908. Ice damaged some of the bridge's piers, requiring reconstruction of Pier No. 1 in the summer.<ref>"Pier Nearing Completion." ''Washington Post.'' June 17, 1908.</ref> Engineers discovered that many of the bridge's piers had been undermined by water, and rush repairs were made.<ref>"Holes in Bridge Piers." ''Washington Post.'' October 15, 1908; "Bridge in Good Condition." ''Washington Post.'' October 16, 1908.</ref> But the aging structure continued to suffer damage, and by September 1912 the bridge was leaning dangerously to the west.<ref>"Points to Adqueduct Bridge." ''Washington Post.'' September 15, 1912.</ref> Fears that the bridge would give way during the spring ice jams worsened. The bridge piers were extensively repaired again in 1913.<ref name="KutzAde" />

===The Carlin bill===
In March 1914, Representative [[Charles Creighton Carlin]] of Virginia sponsored legislation to replace Aqueduct Bridge with a new, $1 million structure.<ref>"To Push Bridge Bill." ''Washington Post.'' March 17, 1914.</ref> The Commissioners of the District of Columbia (the city's appointed government) approved of the new bridge in June.<ref>"Urge Bridge Improvement." ''Washington Post.'' March 19, 1914; "Approve Bridge Plan." ''Washington Post.'' June 20, 1914.</ref> Controversy over the new bridge immediately broke out.  Senator [[Claude A. Swanson]], chairman of the Senate Committee on Public Works, wanted the new bridge built about {{convert|3,000|ft|m|-1}} downstream at the mouth of [[Rock Creek (Potomac River)|Rock Creek]] (at about 30th Street NW), where it would cross [[Theodore Roosevelt Island|Analostan Island]] and the Potomac River to Rosslyn.<ref>"Wants 2 New Bridges."Washington Post.'' July 10, 1914.</ref> Georgetown merchants strongly opposed this plan.<ref>"Fights Bridge Change." ''Washington Post.'' July 13, 1914; "Near the Old Bridge." ''Washington Post." ''July 15, 1914.</ref> There were some in Congress who wanted to repair the existing bridge, but a study by the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] in August 1914 showed that the existing structure was inadequate for the amount of traffic and too unstable to be saved.<ref name="KutzAde">"Wants A New Bridge." ''Washington Post.'' August 12, 1914.</ref> [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Lindley Miller Garrison]], who oversaw the Corps, agreed that a new bridge was necessarily in December.<ref>"Agree on New Bridge." ''Washington Post.'' December 25, 1914.</ref> Rep. [[William C. Adamson]], chairman of the House Committee on Public Works, challenged Swanson and declared that the new bridge should be placed where the old one was.<ref>"Adamson Declares Aqueduct Bridge Inadequate, Unsafe, and Unsightly." ''Washington Post.'' January 9, 1915.</ref>

The Carlin bill began moving through the House in January 1915. But House members balked at the cost.<ref>"Plead for New Bridge." ''Washington Post.'' January 9, 1915.</ref> Garrison tried to break the deadlock on January 9 by issuing a report that declared the existing bridge unsafe, and requesting that the new one be built in the same location.<ref>"Finds Old Bridge Bad." ''Washington Post.'' January 10, 1915.</ref> The D.C. Commissioners said the location of the bridge was up to them,<ref>"Aqueduct Plans Held Up." ''Washington Post.'' February 26, 1915.</ref> and the Corps warned that not only could the existing bridge not be enlarged but agreed with Garrison that it was structurally unsound.<ref>"Larger Bridge Loads Urged." ''Washington Post.'' October 29, 1915; "Old Bridge Is Unsafe." ''Washington Post.'' January 8, 1916.</ref> Swanson changed his mind, and agreed in January 1916 that the new bridge should be built on the existing site.<ref>"Bridge Plea to Garrison." ''Washington Post.'' January 21, 1916.</ref> Garrison endorsed the Carlin bill on January 27.<ref>"Garrison For New Bridge." ''Washington Post.'' January 28, 1916.</ref> On February 3, 1916, vehicular traffic over Aqueduct Bridge was limited by the city to a single automobile at a time due to its dangerous nature.<ref>"Limits Aqeduct Traffic." ''Washington Post.'' February 4, 1916.</ref> The House passed legislation appropriating $1.175 million for construction of a new bridge on March 6.<ref>"$1,000,000 For New Bridge." ''Washington Post.'' March 7, 1916.</ref> D.C. commissioners held hearings on the bridge site in late March, and approved the site in early April.<ref>"Hearing on Bridge Monday." ''Washington Post.'' March 26, 1916; "Bridge Where It Is." ''Washington Post.'' April 6, 1916.</ref> The Senate passed some minor amendments to the House bill, and after some legislative discussions and a conference committee, the Carlin bill passed Congress on May 2, 1916.<ref>"Credit for Aqueduct Bridge." ''Washington Post.'' May 3, 1916; "New Bridge Assured." ''Washington Post.'' May 3, 1916.</ref> President Woodrow Wilson signed the legislation on May 19.<ref>"Signs Aqueduct Bridge Bill." ''Washington Post.'' May 20, 1916.</ref>

===Demolition of Aqueduct Bridge===
[[Image:Abutment side view.JPG|thumb|Side view of second Aqueduct Bridge abutment, with Water Street and Whitehurst Freeway visible through the arch.]]
On June 1, 1916, the Army Corps of Engineers named the new bridge "Francis Scott Key Bridge," in honor of the man who had written the lyrics to the ''[[Star Spangled Banner]]'' whose home was just a few blocks from the bridge's abutment. Plans began to be drawn up at that time.<ref>"Ready to Draw Bridge Plans." ''Washington Post.'' June 2, 1916.</ref> The plans were nearly complete by September.<ref>"Hurry New Bridge Plans." ''Washington Post.'' September 10, 1916.</ref> When repairs on Aqueduct Bridge were made in October 1916 to prepare the structure for winter, the Corps discovered even more deterioration than before.<ref>"Bares Bridge's Weakness." ''Washington Post.'' October 8, 1916.</ref>

In January 1917, the Corps of Engineers found that inflation in the price of construction materials made it necessary to ask for $300,000 more in funding from Congress.<ref>"Adqueduct Bridge Plea." ''Washington Post.'' January 25, 1917.</ref> Congress balked at paying.<ref>"Balks at Bridge Cost." ''Washington Post.'' February 17, 1917.</ref> But citizen pressure and the danger of collapse due to ice flows in the spring<ref>"Citizens Want Bridge Now." ''Washington Post.'' February 19, 1917; "Aqueduct Bridge's Danger Is Passed." ''Washington Post.'' February 20, 1917.</ref> convinced Congress to pay the money.  Construction contracts were drawn up in late February,<ref>"Key Bridge Ready in 1919." ''Washington Post.'' February 28, 1917.</ref> and excavation work on the D.C. abutments began in March.<ref>"At Work For Key Bridge Abutment." ''Washington Post.'' March 29, 1918.</ref> The first [[coffer dam]] for construction of the piers was sunk in May 1918,<ref>"Key Coffer Dam Ready." ''Washington Post.'' May 12, 1918.</ref> and the old Aqueduct Bridge formally closed on July 9.<ref>"Order Bridge Closed." ''Washington Post.'' July 10, 1921.</ref>  The new $2.35 million Key Bridge opened on January 17, 1923.<ref>"Key Bridge Is Opened." ''Washington Post.'' January 18, 1923.</ref>

Although Georgetown citizens pressed for the old Aqueduct Bridge span to remain open for use as a recreation site,<ref>"Want Bridge Span Retained As A Pier." ''Washington Post.'' April 18, 1922.</ref> the bridge was razed beginning in December 1933.<ref>"Danger Great On Span Job, CWA Warned." ''Washington Post.'' December 16, 1933; "Civil Works Funds Used in Razing of Structure." ''Washington Post.'' December 26, 1933; "Skilled Labor Razing Bridge Gets Pay Boost." ''Washington Post.'' December 27, 1933; "Cold Wave Slows Razing of Bridge." ''Washington Post.'' December 30, 1933.</ref> The Aqueduct Bridge's superstructure and most of the above-water portions of its piers were removed in 1933.<ref name="Goode">Goode, p. 449.</ref> The bases of the piers were retained to protect the Key Bridge's piers from ice floe damage. 

The piers, however, were criticized by recreational boaters (particularly rowers from nearby [[Georgetown University]]) as an obstacle to enjoyment of the river and a navigational hazard.<ref name="Goode" /><ref name="Midriver">"Midriver Compromise Preserves A Pier of Old Aqueduct Bridge." ''Washington Post.'' August 22, 1962.</ref> Army engineers and Rep. [[Joel Broyhill]] refused to remove the piers, citing their value to protecting Key Bridge and the cost of their removal. But in August 1962, these groups agreed that seven of the eight Aqueduct Bridge piers would be removed (with one pier remaining as a historical marker).<ref name="Midriver" /><ref>"Army to Remove Old Bridge Piers to Clear Rowing Course on Potomac." ''Washington Post.'' July 20, 1962.</ref> Dismantling of the piers began on September 11, 1962.<ref>Grant, Gerald. "6 Divers, Small Army of Equipment Dismantling Aqueduct Bridge Piers." ''Washington Post.'' September 12, 1962.</ref> The pilings were blasted out to a depth of {{convert|12|ft|m|1}} below the waterline.<ref>{{cite web

The Aqueduct Bridge's Washington abutment still survives and is located west of the Key Bridge.  The southern arch underneath the abutment is used to shelter [[Racing shell|rowing shells]] belonging to members of the Potomac Boat Club.<ref>{{cite web
