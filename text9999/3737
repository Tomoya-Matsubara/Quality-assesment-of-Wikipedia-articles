During his time at IAS, he co-directed an international research team on a project titled <U+201C>Convergence and Divergence in Pentateuchal Theory: Bridging the Academic Cultures of Israel, North America, and Europe<U+201D> and co-organized an international conference, which was held on May 12<U+2013>13, 2013. The conference featured presentations from a range of scholars and sought to further international exchange and establish a shared intellectual dialogue.<ref>http://www.as.huji.ac.il/content/convergence-and-divergence-pentateuchal-theory-bridging-academic-cultures-israel-north/</ref>

More recently, Levinson has co-organized a second international conference at IAS with the title <U+201C>The Pentateuch within Biblical Literature: Formation and Interaction.<U+201D> This upcoming conference, scheduled for May 25-29, 2014 in Jerusalem, will focus primarily on the formation of the Pentateuch and its interaction with both the prophetic corpus and the historiographic literature of the Hebrew Bible.<ref>http://ias.huji.ac.il/pentateuch</ref>
