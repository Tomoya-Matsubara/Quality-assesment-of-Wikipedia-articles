'''''Casablanca''''' is a 1942 American romantic drama film directed by [[Michael Curtiz]], starring [[Humphrey Bogart]], [[Ingrid Bergman]] and [[Paul Henreid]], and featuring [[Claude Rains]], [[Conrad Veidt]], [[Sydney Greenstreet]] and [[Peter Lorre]]. Set during [[World War II]], it focuses on a man torn between, in the words of one character, love and virtue. He must choose between his love for a woman and helping her and her [[Czechoslovakia|Czech]] [[Resistance during World War II|Resistance]] leader husband escape from the [[Vichy France#Vichy French colonies|Vichy]]-controlled [[French protectorate of Morocco|Moroccan]] city of [[Casablanca]] to continue his fight against the [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]].

==Plot==
Rick Blaine ([[Humphrey Bogart]]) is a cynical American [[expatriate]] living in [[Casablanca]] in early December 1941. He owns and runs "Rick's Caf<U+00E9> Am<U+00E9>ricain", an upscale nightclub and gambling den that attracts a mixed client<U+00E8>le: Vichy French, Italian, and Nazi officials; [[Refugee#World War II and UNHCR|refugees]] desperately seeking to reach the United States, as yet uninvolved in the war; and those who prey on them. Although Rick professes to be neutral in all matters, it is later revealed he [[Gunrunning|ran guns]] to [[Ethiopian Empire|Ethiopia]] to combat the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War|1935 Italian invasion]] and fought on the [[Second Spanish Republic|Republican]] side in the [[Spanish Civil War]].

A man on the far right is wearing a suit and looking to the other people.|From left to right: Paul Henreid, Ingrid Bergman, Claude Rains and Humphrey Bogart.]]
Ugarte ([[Peter Lorre]]), a petty criminal, arrives in Rick's club with "letters of transit" obtained through the murder of two German couriers. The papers allow the bearer to travel freely around German-controlled Europe and to neutral Portugal, and from there to America. The letters are almost priceless to the continual stream of refugees who end up stranded in Casablanca. Ugarte plans to sell them to the highest bidder, who is due to arrive at the club later that night. Before the exchange can take place, Ugarte is arrested by the local police under the command of Captain Louis Renault ([[Claude Rains]]), a self-admitted corrupt opportunist. Ugarte dies in police custody without revealing that he had entrusted the letters to Rick.

At this point, the reason for Rick's bitterness re-enters his life. His ex-lover, [[Norway|Norwegian]] Ilsa Lund ([[Ingrid Bergman]]), walks into his establishment. Upon seeing the house pianist, Sam, Ilsa asks him to play [[As Time Goes By (song)|"As Time Goes By"]]. When Rick storms over, furious that Sam has disobeyed his order never to perform that song, he is shocked to see Ilsa. She is accompanied by her husband, Victor Laszlo ([[Paul Henreid]]), a fugitive [[Czech Resistance]] leader who has escaped from a Nazi [[concentration camp]]. The couple need the letters to leave for America to continue his work. German Major Strasser ([[Conrad Veidt]]) arrives in Casablanca to see to it that Laszlo does not succeed. 

When Laszlo makes inquiries with Signor Ferrari ([[Sydney Greenstreet]]), a major figure in the criminal underworld and Rick's friendly business rival, Ferrari divulges his suspicion that Rick has the letters. Laszlo meets with Rick privately, but Rick refuses to part with the documents, telling Laszlo to ask his wife for the reason. They are interrupted when Strasser leads a group of officers in singing "[[Die Wacht am Rhein]]". In response, Laszlo orders the house band to play "[[La Marseillaise]]". When the band looks to Rick for guidance, he nods his head. Laszlo starts singing, alone at first, then patriotic fervor grips the crowd and everyone joins in, drowning out the Germans. In retaliation, Strasser has Renault close the club.

That night, Ilsa confronts Rick in the deserted caf<U+00E9>. When he refuses to give her the letters, she threatens him with a gun, but then confesses that she still loves him. She explains that when they first met and fell in love in Paris, she believed that her husband had been killed attempting to escape from the concentration camp. Later, while preparing to flee with Rick from the imminent fall of the city to the German army, she learned that Laszlo was in fact alive and in hiding. She left Rick without explanation to tend to her ill husband.

[[File:Casablanca, Trailer Screenshot.JPG|thumb|left|alt=Black-and-white film screenshot of a man and woman as seen from the shoulders up. The two are close to each other as if about to kiss.|Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman.]]

With the revelation, the lovers are reconciled. Rick agrees to help, leading her to believe that she will stay behind with him when Laszlo leaves. When Laszlo unexpectedly shows up, having narrowly escaped a police raid on a Resistance meeting, Rick has waiter Carl ([[S. Z. Sakall|S. K. Sakall]]) secretly take Ilsa back to the hotel while the two men talk.

Laszlo reveals he is aware of Rick's love for Ilsa and tries to persuade him to use the letters to take her to safety. When the police arrest Laszlo on a minor, trumped-up charge, Rick convinces Renault to release him by promising to set him up for a much more serious crime: possession of the letters of transit. To allay Renault's suspicions, Rick explains he and Ilsa will be leaving for America.

When Renault tries to arrest Laszlo as arranged, Rick forces him at gunpoint to assist in their escape. At the last moment, Rick makes Ilsa board the plane to Lisbon with her husband, telling her she would regret it if she stayed, "Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon and for the rest of your life."

Major Strasser, tipped off by Renault, drives up alone. Rick shoots him when he tries to intervene. When his men arrive, Renault pauses, then tells them to "Round up the usual suspects." Once they are alone, Renault suggests to Rick they join the [[Free French]] at [[Brazzaville]]. They walk off into the fog with one of the most memorable exit lines in movie history: "Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship."

==Cast==
[[File:Humphrey Bogart and Sydney Greenstreet in Casablanca crop .jpg|right|thumb|alt=Black-and-white film screenshot of two men, both wearing suits. The man on the left is older and is nearly bald; the man on the right has black hair. In the background several bottles of alcohol can be seen.|Sydney Greenstreet (left) and Humphrey Bogart]]
The play's cast consisted of 16 speaking parts and several extras; the film script enlarged it to 22 speaking parts and hundreds of extras.<ref>{{Harvnb|Francisco|1980|p=119}}</ref> The cast is notable for its internationalism: only three of the credited actors were born in the U.S. The top-billed actors were:

* [[Humphrey Bogart]] as Rick Blaine. Earlier in his career, he had been [[Typecasting (acting)|typecast]] as a [[gangster]]. ''[[High Sierra (film)|High Sierra]]'' (1941) had allowed him to play a character with some warmth, but Rick was his first truly romantic role.
* [[Ingrid Bergman]] as Ilsa Lund. Bergman's official website calls Ilsa her "most famous and enduring role".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ingridbergman.com/about/bio2.htm|title=From quintessential "good girl" to Hollywood heavyweight|publisher=The Family of Ingrid Bergman|accessdate=2007-08-03}}</ref> The Swedish actress's [[Hollywood]] debut in ''[[Intermezzo (1939 film)|Intermezzo]]'' had been well received, but her subsequent films were not major successes<U+2014>until ''Casablanca''. Ebert calls her "luminous", and comments on the chemistry between her and Bogart: "she paints his face with her eyes".<ref name="Ebertcommentary" /> Other actresses considered for the role of Ilsa included [[Ann Sheridan]], [[Hedy Lamarr]] and [[Mich<U+00E8>le Morgan]]. Wallis obtained the services of Bergman, who was contracted to David O. Selznick, by loaning [[Olivia de Havilland]] in exchange.<ref>{{Harvnb|Harmetz|1992|pp=88<U+2013>89,92,95}}</ref>
* [[Paul Henreid]] as Victor Laszlo. Henreid, an Austrian actor who emigrated in 1935, was reluctant to take the role (it "set [him] as a stiff forever", according to [[Pauline Kael]]<ref>{{Harvnb|Harmetz|1992|p=99}}</ref>), until he was promised top billing along with Bogart and Bergman. Henreid did not get on well with his fellow actors; he considered Bogart "a mediocre actor", while Bergman called Henreid a "prima donna".<ref>{{Harvnb|Harmetz|1992|p=97}}</ref>

The second-billed actors were:

* [[Claude Rains]] as Captain Louis Renault. Rains was an English actor born in London. He had previously worked with Michael Curtiz on ''[[The Adventures of Robin Hood (film)|The Adventures of Robin Hood]]''. He later appeared in Alfred Hitchcock's ''[[Notorious (1946 film)|Notorious]]'' with Ingrid Bergman.
* [[Conrad Veidt]]{{anchor|Major Strasser}} as Major Heinrich Strasser. He was a German actor who had appeared in ''[[The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1920 film)|The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari]]'' before fleeing from the Nazis and ironically was best-known for playing Nazis in U.S. films.
* [[Sydney Greenstreet]] as Signor Ferrari, a rival nightclub owner. Another Englishman, Greenstreet had previously starred with Lorre and Bogart in his film debut in ''[[The Maltese Falcon (1941 film)|The Maltese Falcon]]''.
*[[Peter Lorre]] as Signor Ugarte. Lorre was an Austrian character actor who had left Germany in 1933.

Also credited were:

* [[Dooley Wilson]] as Sam. He was one of the few American members of the cast. A [[drummer]], he could not play the piano. Hal Wallis had considered changing Sam to a female character ([[Hazel Scott]] and [[Ella Fitzgerald]] were candidates), and even after shooting had been completed, Wallis considered dubbing over Wilson's voice for the songs.<ref>{{Harvnb|Harmetz|1992|pp=139<U+2013>140, 260}}</ref><ref>Behlmer, p. 214.</ref>
* [[Joy Page]] as Annina Brandel, the young [[Bulgaria]]n refugee. The third credited American, she was studio head [[Jack Warner]]'s stepdaughter.
* [[Madeleine LeBeau]] as Yvonne, Rick's soon-discarded girlfriend. The French actress was [[Marcel Dalio]]'s wife until their divorce in 1942.
* [[S. Z. Sakall]] (credited as S. K. Sakall) as Carl, the waiter. He was a Hungarian actor who fled from Germany in 1939. His three sisters later died in a [[concentration camp]].
* [[Curt Bois]] as the pickpocket. Bois was a German [[Jew]]ish actor and another refugee. He had one of the longest careers in film, making his first appearance in 1907 and his last in 1987.
* [[John Qualen]] as Berger, Laszlo's Resistance contact. He was born in Canada, but grew up in America. He appeared in many of [[John Ford]]'s movies.
* [[Leonid Kinskey]] as Sascha, the Russian bartender infatuated with Yvonne. He was actually born in Russia.

Notable uncredited actors were:

* [[Marcel Dalio]] as Emil the [[croupier]]. He had been a star in French cinema, appearing in [[Jean Renoir]]'s ''[[La Grande Illusion]]'' and ''[[The Rules of the Game|La Regle de Jeu]]'', but after he fled the fall of France, he was reduced to bit parts in Hollywood. He had a key role in another of Bogart's films, ''[[To Have and Have Not (film)|To Have and Have Not]]''.
* [[Helmut Dantine]] as Jan Brandel, the Bulgarian roulette player married to Annina Brandel. Another Austrian, he had spent time in a concentration camp after the [[Anschluss]], the annexation of Austria.
* [[Norma Varden]] as the Englishwoman whose husband has his wallet stolen. She was a famous English character actress.
* [[Jean Del Val]] as the French police radio announcer who (following the opening montage sequence) reports the news of the murder of the two German couriers.
* [[Torben Meyer]] as the Dutch banker who runs "the second largest banking house in Amsterdam". Meyer was a Danish actor.
* [[Dan Seymour]] as Abdul the doorman. He was an American actor who, at 265 pounds, often played villains, including the principal one in ''To Have and Have Not''.
* [[Gregory Gaye]] as the German banker who is refused entry to the casino by Rick. Gaye was a Russian-born actor who went to the United States in 1917 after the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]].
* [[William Edmunds (actor)|William Edmunds]] as a contact man at Rick's. He usually played characters with heavy accents, such as Martini in ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]'' (1946).
* [[Leon Belasco]] as a dealer in Rick's Cafe. A Russian-American character actor, he appeared in 13 films the year ''Casablanca'' was released.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mcgady.net/Casab/evenmore/even_more_minor_characters.html |title=Leon Belasco as a Dealer |accessdate=13 September 2010 |publisher=mcgady.net}}</ref>
* [[Georges Renavent]] as Conspirator.
* [[Leo White]] as the waiter Emile (not to be confused with the croupier Emil), from whom Renault orders a drink when he sits down with the Laszlos. White was a familiar face in many Charlie Chaplin two-reelers in the 1910s, usually playing an upper-class antagonist.
* [[Jack Benny]] may have had an unbilled cameo role (claimed by a contemporary newspaper advertisement<ref>{{cite news |title=Special Contest / Find Jack Benny in "Casablanca" |author= |newspaper=The Evening Independent |date=February 4, 1943 |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=950&dat=19430204&id=DRoOAAAAIBAJ&sjid=f30DAAAAIBAJ&pg=5078,4032886}}{{dead link|date=November 2010}}</ref> and reportedly in the ''Casablanca'' press book<ref name=Ebert/>). When asked in his column "Movie Answer Man", critic [[Roger Ebert]] first replied, "It looks something like him.

Part of the emotional impact of the film has been attributed to the large proportion of European exiles and refugees among the extras and in the minor roles. A witness to the filming of the "duel of the anthems" sequence said he saw many of the actors crying and "realized that they were all real refugees".<ref>{{Harvnb|Harmetz|1992|p=213}}</ref> Harmetz argues that they "brought to a dozen small roles in ''Casablanca'' an understanding and a desperation that could never have come from Central Casting".<ref>{{Harvnb|Harmetz|1992|p=214}}</ref> The German citizens among them nevertheless had to keep [[curfew]] as [[enemy alien]]s. Ironically, they were frequently cast as the Nazis from whom they had fled.

Some of the exiled foreign actors were:

* [[Wolfgang Zilzer]] who is shot in the opening scene of the movie, was a silent movie actor in Germany who left when the Nazis took over. He later married Casablanca actress Lotte Palfi.
* [[Hans Twardowski]] as a Nazi officer who argues with a French officer over Yvonne. He was born in Stettin, Germany (now [[Szczecin]], Poland).
* [[Ludwig St<U+00F6>ssel]] as Mr. Leuchtag, the German refugee whose English is "not so good". Born in Austria, the Jewish actor was imprisoned following the [[Anschluss]], the annexation of Austria. When he was released, he left for England and then America. St<U+00F6>ssel became famous for doing a long series of commercials for Italian Swiss Colony wine producers. Dressed in an Alpine hat and [[lederhosen]], St<U+00F6>ssel was their spokesman with the slogan, "That Little Old Winemaker, Me!"
* [[Ilka Gr<U+00FC>nig]] as Mrs. Leuchtag. Born in [[Vienna]], she was a silent movie star in Germany who came to America after the Anschluss.
* Lotte Palfi as the refugee trying to sell her diamonds. Born in Germany, she played stage roles at a prestigious theater in [[Darmstadt]], Germany. She journeyed to America after the Nazis came to power in 1933. She later married another Casablanca actor, Wolfgang Zilzer.
* [[Trude Berliner]] as a [[baccarat]] player in Rick's. Born in Berlin, she was a famous cabaret performer and film actress. Being Jewish, she left Germany in 1933.
* [[Louis V. Arco]] as another refugee in Rick's. Born Lutz Altschul in Austria, he moved to America shortly after the Anschluss and changed his name.
* [[Richard Ryen]] as Strasser's aide, Captain Heinze. The Austrian Jew acted in German films, but fled the Nazis.

==Production==
The film was based on [[Murray Burnett]] and [[Joan Alison]]'s then-unproduced [[Play (theatre)|play]] ''[[Everybody Comes to Rick's]]''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Behlmer|first=Rudy|title=Inside Warner Bros.

The entire picture was shot in the studio, except for the sequence showing Major Strasser's arrival, which was filmed at [[Van Nuys Airport]], and a few short clips of stock footage views of Paris.<ref>{{Harvnb|Francisco|1980|p=139}}</ref> The street used for the exterior shots had recently been built for another film, ''[[The Desert Song]]'',<ref>Behlmer, pp. 214<U+2013>215</ref> and [[Set dresser|redressed]] for the Paris [[flashback (literary technique)|flashback]]s. It remained on the Warners [[backlot]] until the 1960s. The set for Rick's was built in three unconnected parts, so the internal layout of the building is indeterminate. In a number of scenes, the camera looks through a wall from the cafe area into Rick's office. The background of the final scene, which shows a [[Lockheed Model 12 Electra Junior]] airplane with personnel walking around it, was staged using [[midget]] [[extra (actor)|extras]] and a proportionate cardboard plane.<ref name="BluYouMust1">{{cite video|title=Casablanca-You Must Remember This...A Tribute to Casablanca|medium=Blu-ray Disc|publisher=[[Warner Home Video]]|time=21:09|date=February&nbsp;2, 2010}}</ref> Fog was used to mask the model's unconvincing appearance.<ref>{{Harvnb|Harmetz|1992|p=237}}</ref> Nevertheless, the [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]] theme park in [[Orlando, Florida]] purchased a Lockheed 12A for its [[Great Movie Ride]] attraction, and initially claimed that it was the actual plane used in the film.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.snopes.com/disney/parks/casablanca.asp | title=The Plane Truth | publisher=[[Snopes]] | date=August 21, 2007 | accessdate=2007-12-06}}</ref> Film critic [[Roger Ebert]] called [[Hal Wallis]] the "key creative force" for his attention to the details of production (down to insisting on a real parrot in the Blue Parrot bar).<ref name="Ebertcommentary">Ebert, Roger.

The difference between Bergman's and Bogart's height caused some problems. She was some two&nbsp;inches (5&nbsp;cm) taller than Bogart, and claimed Curtiz had Bogart stand on blocks or sit on cushions in their scenes together.<ref>{{Harvnb|Harmetz|1992|p=170}}</ref>

Wallis wrote the final line ("Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.") after shooting had been completed. Bogart had to be called in a month after the end of filming to dub it.<ref name="BluYouMust5">{{cite video|title=Casablanca-You Must Remember This...A Tribute to Casablanca|medium=Blu-ray Disc|publisher=[[Warner Home Video]]|time=29:57|date=February&nbsp;2, 2010}}</ref>

Later, there were plans for a further scene, showing Rick, Renault and a detachment of Free French soldiers on a ship, to incorporate the Allies' [[Operation Torch|1942 invasion of North Africa]]; however, it proved too difficult to get Claude Rains for the shoot, and the scene was finally abandoned after [[David O. Selznick]] judged "it would be a terrible mistake to change the ending."<ref>{{Harvnb|Harmetz|1992|pp=280<U+2013>281}}</ref>

===Writing===
The original play was inspired by a trip to Europe made by Murray Burnett in 1938, during which he visited Vienna shortly after the [[Anschluss]], where he saw discrimination by Nazis first-hand. In the south of France, he came across a nightclub, which had a multinational clientele and the prototype of Sam, the black piano player.<ref>{{Harvnb|Harmetz|1992|pp=53<U+2013>54}}</ref><ref name="BluYouMust2">{{cite video|title=Casablanca-You Must Remember This...A Tribute to Casablanca|medium=Blu-ray Disc|publisher=[[Warner Home Video]]|time=4:36|date=February&nbsp;2, 2010}}</ref> In the play, the Ilsa character was an American named Lois Meredith and did not meet Laszlo until after her relationship with Rick in Paris had ended; Rick was a lawyer. To make Rick's motivation more believable, Wallis, Curtiz, and the screenwriters decided to set the film before the [[attack on Pearl Harbor|events of Pearl Harbor]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Francisco|1980|p=121}}</ref>

The first writers to work on the script were the Epstein twins, [[Julius J. Epstein|Julius]] and [[Philip G. Epstein|Philip]], who removed Rick's background and added more elements of comedy. The other credited writer, [[Howard Koch (screenwriter)|Howard Koch]], came later, but worked in parallel with them, despite their differing emphases; Koch highlighted the political and melodramatic elements.<ref>{{Harvnb|Harmetz|1992|pp=56<U+2013>59}}</ref><ref name="Francisco 1545">{{Harvnb|Francisco|1980|pp=154<U+2013>155}}</ref> The uncredited [[Casey Robinson]] assisted with three weeks of rewrites, including contributing the series of meetings between Rick and Ilsa in the cafe.<ref name="MerlockCasa">{{Cite journal|last=Merlock|first=Ray|title=Casablanca|journal=[[Journal of Popular Film & Television]]|volume=27|issue=4|page=2|date=Winter 2000|ref=harv|postscript=.}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Harmetz|1992|pp=175,179}}</ref> Curtiz seems to have favored the romantic parts, insisting on retaining the Paris flashbacks.<ref name="Francisco 1545"/><ref name="BluYouMust4">{{cite video|title=Casablanca-You Must Remember This...A Tribute to Casablanca|medium=Blu-ray Disc|publisher=[[Warner Home Video]]|time=9:59|date=February&nbsp;2, 2010}}</ref> Despite the many writers, the film has what Ebert describes as a "wonderfully unified and consistent" script. Koch later claimed it was the tension between his own approach and Curtiz's which accounted for this: "Surprisingly, these disparate approaches somehow meshed, and perhaps it was partly this tug of war between Curtiz and me that gave the film a certain balance."<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/1991/8/1991_8_92.shtml| last = Sorel | first = Edward | title = Casablanca | publisher = [[American Heritage (magazine)|''American Heritage'' magazine]] | month = December | year = 1991|accessdate=2007-08-03}}</ref> Julius Epstein would later note the screenplay contained "more corn than in the states of Kansas and Iowa combined.

The film ran into some trouble from Joseph Breen of the [[Motion Picture Production Code|Production Code Administration]] (the Hollywood self-censorship body), who opposed the suggestions that Captain Renault extorted sexual favors from his supplicants, and that Rick and Ilsa had slept together in Paris.<ref>[http://www2.lib.virginia.edu/exhibits/censored/film.html Censored Films and Television at University of Virginia online]</ref> Extensive changes were made, with several lines of dialogue removed and/or altered, and all direct references to sex in the film removed. Additionally, when Sam played "As Time Goes By" in the original script, Rick had remarked "What the <U+2014><U+2014> are you playing?"<ref>{{Harvnb|Gardner|1988|p=4}}</ref> This line implying a curse word was removed at the behest of the Hays Office, and both Renault's selling of visas for sex, and Rick and Ilsa's previous sexual relationship were implied elliptically rather than referenced explicitly.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gardner|1988|pp=2<U+2013>4}}</ref>

Wallis' first choice for [[Film director|director]] was [[William Wyler]], but he was unavailable, so Wallis turned to his close friend [[Michael Curtiz]].<ref name="harmetz75">{{Harvnb|Harmetz|1992|p=75}}</ref> Curtiz was a Hungarian [[Jew]]ish <U+00E9>migr<U+00E9>; he had come to the U.S. in the 1920s, but some of his family were refugees from Nazi Europe.
[[Roger Ebert]] has commented that in ''Casablanca'' "very few shots... are memorable as shots," Curtiz being concerned to use images to tell the story rather than for their own sake.<ref name="Ebertcommentary" /> However, he had relatively little input into the development of the plot: Casey Robinson said Curtiz "knew nothing whatever about story...he saw it in pictures, and you supplied the stories."<ref name="Ebertcommentaryquote">Quoted in Ebert commentary.</ref> Critic [[Andrew Sarris]] called the film "the most decisive exception to the [[auteur theory]]",<ref>Sarris, Andrew (1968). ''The American Cinema: Directors and Directions 1929<U+2013>1968'' (New York: Dutton), p.176.</ref> of which Sarris was the most prominent proponent in the United States, to which [[Aljean Harmetz]] responded, "nearly every Warner Bros. picture was an exception to the auteur theory".<ref name="harmetz75" /> Other critics give more credit to Curtiz; Sidney Rosenzweig, in his study of the director's work, sees the film as a typical example of Curtiz's highlighting of moral dilemmas.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rosenzweig|first=Sidney|year=1982|title=Casablanca and Other Major Films of Michael Curtiz|location=Ann Arbor, Mich|publisher=UMI Research Press|pages=158<U+2013>159|isbn=0835713040}}</ref>

The [[second unit]] [[Film editing|montage]]s, such as the opening sequence of the refugee trail and that showing the invasion of France, were directed by [[Don Siegel]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Harmetz|1992|p=264}}</ref>

===Cinematography===
[[File:Croix de Lorraine 3.svg|upright|right|thumb|alt=A symbol of a large cross, with a smaller cross attached to the top of it. Similar to a "+" with a "T" below it.|The [[Cross of Lorraine]], emblem of the Free French Forces.]]

The [[cinematographer]] was [[Arthur Edeson]], a veteran who had previously shot ''[[The Maltese Falcon (1941 film)|The Maltese Falcon]]'' and ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]]''. Particular attention was paid to photographing Bergman. She was shot mainly from her preferred left side, often with a softening gauze filter and with [[catch light]]s to make her eyes sparkle; the whole effect was designed to make her face seem "ineffably sad and tender and nostalgic".<ref name="Ebertcommentary" /> Bars of shadow across the characters and in the background variously imply imprisonment, the [[crucifix]], the symbol of the [[Free French Forces]] and emotional turmoil.<ref name="Ebertcommentary" /> Dark ''[[film noir]]'' and [[expressionist]] lighting is used in several scenes, particularly towards the end of the picture. Rosenzweig argues these shadow and lighting effects are classic elements of the Curtiz style, along with the fluid camera work and the use of the environment as a framing device.<ref>Rosenzweig, pp.6<U+2013>7</ref>

===Music===
The music was written by [[Max Steiner]], who was best known for the [[film score|score]] for [[Gone with the Wind (film)|''Gone with the Wind'']]. The song "[[As Time Goes By (song)|As Time Goes By]]" by [[Herman Hupfeld]] had been part of the story from the original play; Steiner wanted to write his own composition to replace it, but Bergman had already cut her hair short for her next role (Mar<U+00ED>a in ''[[For Whom the Bell Tolls (film)|For Whom the Bell Tolls]]'') and could not re-shoot the scenes which incorporated the song,<ref>"As Time Goes By" enjoyed a resurgence after the release of ''Casablanca'', spending 21 weeks on the [[hit parade]].</ref> so Steiner based the entire score on it and "[[La Marseillaise]]", the French [[national anthem]], transforming them to reflect changing moods.<ref>{{Harvnb|Harmetz|1992|pp=253<U+2013>258}}</ref>

Particularly notable is the "duel of the songs" between Strasser and Laszlo at Rick's cafe. In the soundtrack, "La Marseillaise" is played by a full orchestra. Originally, the opposing piece for this iconic sequence was to be the "[[Horst Wessel Lied]]", a Nazi anthem, but this was still under international copyright in non-Allied countries. The opening bars of the "[[Deutschlandlied]]", the national anthem of Germany, is featured throughout the score as a motif to represent the Germans, much as "La Marseillaise" is used to represent the Allies.

Other songs in the film include "[[It Had to Be You (song)|It Had to Be You]]" from 1924 (music by [[Isham Jones]], lyrics by [[Gus Kahn]]), "[[Shine (Cecil Mack song)|Shine]]" from 1910 (music by Ford Dabney, lyrics by [[Cecil Mack]] and [[Lew Brown]]), "[[Avalon (Al Jolson song)|Avalon]]" from 1920 (music and lyrics by [[Al Jolson]], [[Buddy DeSylva]] and [[Vincent Rose]]), and [[Knock on Wood (1942 song)|"Knock on Wood"]] (music by [[M.K. Jerome]], lyrics by [[Jack Scholl]]), the only original song in the film.

==Timing of release==
Although an initial release date was anticipated for spring 1943,<ref>{{Harvnb|Francisco|1980|p=184}}</ref> the film premiered at the Hollywood Theater in New York City on November 26, 1942, to coincide with the Allied invasion of North Africa and the capture of Casablanca.<ref name="Stein interview" /><ref>{{Harvnb|Francisco|1980|pp=188<U+2013>189}}</ref> In the 1,500-seat theater, the film grossed $255,000 over ten weeks.<ref name="Francisco 192">{{Harvnb|Francisco|1980|p=192}}</ref> It went into general release on January 23, 1943, to take advantage of the [[Casablanca conference]], a high-level meeting between [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]] and [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] in the city.  It was a substantial but not spectacular box-office success, taking $3.7 million on its initial U.S. release, making it the seventh best-selling film of 1943.<ref name="Francisco 192"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Harmetz|1992|p=12}}</ref> The [[United States Office of War Information|Office of War Information]] prevented screening of the film to troops in North Africa, believing it would cause resentment among Vichy supporters in the region.<ref>{{Harvnb|Harmetz|1992|p=286}}</ref>

==Reception==
===Initial response===
''Casablanca'' received "consistently good reviews".<ref>{{cite news | last=Stanley | first=John | title='Casablanca' Celebrates Its 50th | work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] | date=April&nbsp;5, 1992 }}</ref> ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote, "The Warners... have a picture which makes the spine tingle and the heart take a leap." The newspaper applauded the combination of "sentiment, humor and pathos with taut melodrama and bristling intrigue". While the ''Times'' noted its "devious convolutions of the plot", the newspaper praised the screenplay quality as "of the best" and the cast's performances as "all of the first order".<ref>{{cite news | last=Crowther | first=Bosley | title='Casablanca', with Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman, at Hollywood | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=November&nbsp;27, 1942 | page=27 }}</ref> The trade paper ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' commended the film's "combination of fine performances, engrossing story and neat direction" and the "variety of moods, action, suspense, comedy and drama that makes ''Casablanca'' an A-1 entry at the b.o". The paper applauded performances by Bergman and Henreid and analyzed Bogart's own: "Bogart, as might be expected, is more at ease as the bitter and cynical operator of a joint than as a lover, but handles both assignments with superb finesse." ''Variety'' wrote of the film's real-world impact, "Film is splendid anti-Axis propaganda, particularly inasmuch as the propaganda is strictly a by-product of the principal action and contributes to it instead of getting in the way."<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://www.variety.com/index.asp?layout=variety100&content=jump&jump=review&reviewID=VE1117487980&category=1935 | title=Film reviews through the years: ''Casablanca'' | journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=December&nbsp;2, 1942 | accessdate=January&nbsp;1, 2009 | ref=harv | postscript=. }}</ref> Some other reviews were less enthusiastic: ''[[The New Yorker]]'' rated it only "pretty tolerable".<ref>{{Harvnb|Harmetz|1992|pp=12<U+2013>13}}</ref>

===Lasting impact===
The film has grown in popularity. Murray Burnett called it "true yesterday, true today, true tomorrow".<ref>Interviewed in [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0280526/ ''Casablanca 50th Anniversary Special: You Must Remember This''] (Turner: 1992)</ref> By 1955, the film had brought in $6.8 million, making it only the third most successful of Warners' wartime movies (behind ''[[Shine_On,_Harvest_Moon_(film)|Shine On, Harvest Moon]]'' and ''[[This is the Army]]'').<ref>{{Harvnb|Harmetz|1992|p=283}}</ref> On April 21, 1957, the [[Brattle Theater]] of Cambridge, Massachusetts showed the film as part of a season of old movies. It was so popular that it began a tradition of screening ''Casablanca'' during the week of final exams at [[Harvard University]] which continues to the present day, and is emulated by many colleges across the United States. [[Todd Gitlin]], a professor of sociology who himself attended one of these screenings, had said that the experience was, "the acting out of my own personal rite of passage".<ref>{{Harvnb|Harmetz|1992|p=343}}</ref> The tradition helped the movie remain popular while other famous films of the 1940s have faded away, and by 1977, ''Casablanca'' was the most frequently broadcast film on American television.<ref>{{Harvnb|Harmetz|1992|p=346}}</ref>

On the film's 50th anniversary, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' called ''Casablanca''{{'}}s great strength "the purity of its Golden Age Hollywoodness [and] the enduring craftsmanship of its resonantly hokey dialogue". The newspaper believed the film achieved a "near-perfect entertainment balance" of comedy, romance, and suspense.<ref>{{cite news | last=Strauss | first=Bob | title=Still the best: ''Casablanca'' loses no luster over time | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=April&nbsp;10, 1992 }}</ref>

According to [[Roger Ebert]], ''Casablanca'' is "probably on more lists of the greatest films of all time than any other single title, including ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' because of its wider appeal. Ebert opined that ''Citizen Kane'' is generally considered to be a "greater" film but ''Casablanca'' is more loved.<ref name="Ebertcommentary" /> Ebert said that he has never heard of a negative review of the film, even though individual elements can be criticized, citing unrealistic [[special effect]]s and the stiff character/portrayal of Laszlo.<ref name="Ebertcommentaryquote" /> [[Rudy Behlmer]] emphasized the variety in the picture: "it's a blend of drama, melodrama, comedy [and] intrigue".<ref name="Ebertcommentaryquote" /> Film critic [[Leonard Maltin]] has stated that ''Casablanca'' is his favorite movie of all time.

Ebert has said that the film is popular because "the people in it are all so good" and that it is "a wonderful gem". As the Resistance hero, Laszlo is ostensibly the most noble, although he is so stiff that he is hard to like.<ref name="Ebertcommentary" /> The other characters, in Behlmer's words, are "not cut and dried": they come into their goodness in the course of the film. Renault begins the film as a collaborator with the Nazis, who extorts sexual favors from refugees and has Ugarte killed. Rick, according to Behlmer, is "not a hero,... not a bad guy": he does what is necessary to get along with the authorities and "sticks his neck out for nobody". Even Ilsa, the least active of the main characters, is "caught in the emotional struggle" over which man she really loves. By the end of the film, however, "everybody is sacrificing."<ref name="Ebertcommentaryquote" />

There are a few dissenting reviewers. According to [[Pauline Kael]], "It's far from a great film, but it has a special appealingly schlocky romanticism..."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.geocities.com/paulinekaelreviews/c2.html |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5knvV3A24 |archivedate=2009-10-26 |title=Casablanca |author=Pauline Kael |publisher=geocities.com |accessdate=2009-01-05}}</ref> [[Umberto Eco]] wrote that "by any strict critical standards... ''Casablanca'' is a very mediocre film." He viewed the changes the characters undergo as inconsistent rather than complex: "It is a comic strip, a hotch-potch, low on psychological credibility, and with little continuity in its dramatic effects."<ref>[[Umberto Eco|Eco, Umberto]] (1994). ''Signs of Life in the USA: Readings on Popular Culture for Writers'' (Sonia Maasik and Jack Solomon, eds.) Bedford Books. ISBN 0-312-25925-5</ref>

There is anecdotal evidence that ''Casablanca'' may have made a deeper impression among film-lovers than within the professional movie-making establishment. In the November/December 1982 issue of ''American Film'', Chuck Ross claimed that he retyped the screenplay to Casablanca, only changing the title back to ''[[Everybody Comes to Rick's]]'' and the name of the piano player to [[Dooley Wilson]], and submitted it to 217 agencies. Eighty-five of them read it; of those, thirty-eight rejected it outright, thirty-three generally recognized it (but only eight specifically as ''Casablanca''), three declared it commercially viable, and one suggested turning it into a novel.<ref>Zinman, David (April 10, 1983). The Magazine (Sunday supplement to ''[[The Province]]'' newspaper), p. 12</ref>

===Influence on later works===
<!--Please note that this is meant as a list of only THE most notable, not a complete list of pop culture references to the film -->
Many subsequent films have drawn on elements of ''Casablanca''. ''[[Passage to Marseille]]'' reunited Bogart, Rains, Curtiz, Greenstreet and Lorre in 1944, while there are many similarities between ''Casablanca'' and two later Bogart films, ''[[To Have and Have Not (film)|To Have and Have Not]]'' (1944) and ''[[Sirocco (film)|Sirocco]]'' (1951). Parodies have included the [[Marx Brothers]]' ''[[A Night in Casablanca]]'' (1946), [[Neil Simon]]'s ''[[The Cheap Detective]]'' (1978), ''[[Barb Wire (film)|Barb Wire]]'' (1996), and ''[[Out Cold (2001 film)|Out Cold]]'' (2001), while it provided the title for the 1995 hit ''[[The Usual Suspects]]''. [[Woody Allen]]'s ''[[Play It Again, Sam (1972 film)|Play It Again, Sam]]'' (1972) appropriated Bogart's ''Casablanca'' persona as the fantasy mentor for Allen's [[List of English words of Yiddish origin|nebbish]]y character, featuring actor [[Jerry Lacy]] in the role of Bogart.

''Casablanca'' itself was a plot device in the science-fiction television movie ''[[Overdrawn at the Memory Bank]]'' (1983), based on [[John Varley (author)|John Varley]]'s story, and made a similar, though much less pivotal, appearance in [[Terry Gilliam]]'s [[dystopia]]n ''[[Brazil (film)|Brazil]]'' (1985). [[Warner Bros.]] produced its own parody of the film in the homage ''[[Carrotblanca]]'', a 1995 [[Bugs Bunny]] [[cartoon]].<ref name="BluYouMust6">{{cite video|title=Casablanca-You Must Remember This...A Tribute to Casablanca|medium=Blu-ray Disc|publisher=[[Warner Home Video]]|time=31:56|date=February&nbsp;2, 2010}}</ref> In ''[[Casablanca (novella)|Casablanca]]'', a novella by Argentine writer [[Edgar Brau]], the protagonist somehow wanders into Rick's Caf<U+00E9> Americain and listens to a strange tale related by Sam.<ref>{{cite news |title=For the first time in English, the Argentine labyrinths of Edgar Brau. |author=[[Michael Dirda]] |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=January 7, 2007 |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/05/AR2007010500168.html}}</ref>

==Interpretation==
''Casablanca'' has been subjected to many different readings. [[Semiotics|Semioticians]] account for the film's popularity by claiming that its inclusion of a whole series of [[stereotype]]s paradoxically strengthens the film.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=gb2MJdqN2owC&pg=PA79 ''Casablanca and the Paradoxical Truth of Stereotyping''] by James F. Pontuso in ''Political Philosophy Comes to Rick's: Casablanca and American Civic Culture'' by James F. Pontuso. Lexington Books, 2005.

Raleigh in ''Art Times'', April 2003</ref><ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,923243-2,00.html "We'll Always Have Casablanca"] by Lance Morrow in ''Time'', 27 December 1982</ref><ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=3bzpxp_FHj8C&pg=PA32&lpg=PA32&dq=Casablanca+archetypes&source=web&ots=6kgEs0_L7Q&sig=3xgMs1P8wseIz7gWOqko2NyF614&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=6&ct=result "Influence and Intertextuality in Literary History"] by Jay Clayton and Eric Rothstein, University of Wisconsin Press, 1991. ISBN 0299130347, 9780299130343</ref> Umberto Eco explained:

{{quote|Thus ''Casablanca'' is not just one film. It is many films, an anthology. [...] When all the archetypes burst in shamelessly, we reach [[Homer]]ic depths. Two clich<U+00E9>s make us laugh. A hundred clich<U+00E9>s move us. For we sense dimly that the clich<U+00E9>s are talking among themselves, and celebrating a reunion.<ref name="hyperreality">[[Umberto Eco]], ''Travels in Hyperreality'' (1986)</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.themodernword.com/eco/eco_casablanca.html |title=Casablanca, or, The Clich<U+00E9>s are Having a Ball |author=[[Umberto Eco|Eco, Umberto]] |accessdate=May 20, 2009}}</ref>}}

Eco also singled out sacrifice as one of the film's key themes: "the myth of sacrifice runs through the whole film."<ref>[[Umberto Eco|Eco, Umberto]] (1994). ''Signs of Life in the USA: Readings on Popular Culture for Writers'' (Sonia Maasik and Jack Solomon, eds.) Bedford Books.</ref> It was this theme which resonated with a wartime audience that was reassured by the idea that painful sacrifice and going off to war could be romantic gestures done for the greater good.<ref>Gabbard, Krin; [[Glen Gabbard|Gabbard, Glen O.]] (1990). "Play it again, Sigmund: Psychoanalysis and the classical Hollywood text." ''Journal of Popular Film & Television'' vol. 18 no. 1 p. 6<U+2013>17 ISSN 0195-6051</ref>

Koch also considered the film a political [[allegory]]. Rick was compared to President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], who gambled "on the odds of going to war until circumstance and his own submerged nobility force him to close his casino (partisan politics) and commit himself<U+2014>first by financing the Side of Right and then by fighting for it."<ref name="Koch 166">{{Harvnb|Koch|1973|p=166}}</ref> The similarity was reinforced by the film's title, as it was compared to its English equivalent: [[White House]].<ref name="Koch 166"/>

[[William Donelley]], in his ''Love and Death in Casablanca'', argues that Rick's relationship with Sam, and subsequently with Renault, is, "a standard case of the repressed homosexuality that underlies most American adventure stories".<ref>Donnelly, William (1968). "Love and Death in Casablanca" ''Persistence of Vision: A Collection of Film Criticisms'', ed. Joseph McBride. Madison: Wisconsin Fim Society Press, pp. 103<U+2013>7 quoted in Rosenzweig, p.78 and Harmetz, p. 347</ref> [[Harvey Greenberg]] presents a [[Freudian]] reading in his ''The Movies on Your Mind'', in which the transgressions which prevent Rick from returning to the U.S. constitute an [[Oedipus complex]], which is resolved only when Rick begins to identify with the father figure of Laszlo and the cause which he represents.<ref>Greenberg, Harvey (1975). ''The Movies on Your Mind'' New York: Saturday Review Press, p. 88 quoted in Rosenzweig, p. 79 and Harmetz, p. 348</ref> Sidney Rosenzweig argues that such readings are reductive, and that the most important aspect of the film is its ambiguity, above all in the central character of Rick; he cites the different names which each character gives Rick (Richard, Ricky, Mr Rick, Herr Blaine and so on) as evidence of the different meanings which he has for each person.<ref>Rosenzweig, p. 81</ref>

==Accolades==
Due to its November 1942 release, the [[New York Film Critics]] decided to include the film in its 1942 award season for best picture. ''Casablanca'' lost to ''[[In Which We Serve]]''.<ref name="Francisco 192"/> However, the Academy stated that since the film went into national release in the beginning of 1943, it would be included in that year's nominations.<ref>{{Harvnb|Francisco|1980|p=195}}</ref> ''Casablanca'' was nominated for eight Academy Awards, and won three. When the award for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Pictures]] was announced producer [[Hal B. Wallis]] got up to accept, only to find [[Jack Warner]] had rushed onstage to take the trophy. Wallis later recalled, "I had no alternative but to sit down again, humiliated and furious. ... Almost forty years later, I still haven't recovered from the shock."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/791 |title=''Casablanca'': The Unexpected Classic |author=[[Ronald Haver]] |publisher=The Criterion Collection Online Cinematheque |accessdate=January 8, 2010}}</ref>  This incident would lead Wallis to leave Warner Bros. in April.<ref>{{Harvnb|Harmetz|1992|pp=321<U+2013>324}}</ref>

==Home media releases==
''Casablanca'' was initially released on [[Betamax]] and [[VHS]] by [[Magnetic Video]] and later by [[CBS/Fox Video]] (as [[United Artists]] owned the rights at the time). It was next released on [[laserdisc]] in 1991, and on VHS in 1992 - both from [[MGM/UA Home Entertainment]] (distributing for [[Turner Entertainment]]), which at the time was distributed by [[Warner Home Video]]. It was first released on [[DVD]] in 1997 by MGM, containing the trailer and a making-of featurette (Warner Home Video reissued the DVD in 2000). A subsequent two-disc special edition, containing audio commentaries, documentaries, and a newly remastered visual and audio presentation, was released in 2003.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amazon.com/Casablanca-Two-Disc-Special-Lauren-Bacall/dp/B00009W0WM/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&s=dvd&qid=1219962552&sr=1-2|title=Casablanca: Two-Disc Special Edition}}</ref>

An [[HD DVD]] was released on November 14, 2006, containing the same special features as the 2003 DVD.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amazon.com/Casablanca-HD-DVD-Humphrey-Bogart/dp/B000I0RR7Q|title=Casablanca {{bracket|HD-DVD}} (1943)}}</ref> Reviewers were impressed with the new high-definition transfer of the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdbeaver.com/film2/DVDReviews27/casablanca.htm|title=Casablanca&nbsp;<U+2014> Humphrey Bogart}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://hddvd.highdefdigest.com/casablanca.html|title=HD DVD Review: Casablanca | High-Def Digest}}</ref>

A [[Blu-ray]] release with new special features came out on December 2, 2008; it is also available on DVD.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hometheaterforum.com/forum/thread/275515/whv-press-release-casablanca-ultimate-collector-s-edition-dvd-blu-ray|title=WHV Press Release: Casablanca Ultimate Collector's Edition (DVD/Blu-ray) - Home Theater}}</ref> The Blu-ray was initially only released as an expensive gift set with a booklet, a luggage tag and other assorted gift-type items. It was eventually released as a stand-alone Blu-Ray in September 2009.

==Sequels and other versions==
Almost from the moment ''Casablanca'' became a hit, talk began of producing a sequel. One titled ''Brazzaville'' (in the final scene, Renault recommends fleeing to that [[Brazzaville|Free French-held city]]) was planned, but never produced.<ref>{{Harvnb|Francisco|1980|p=204}}</ref> Since then, no studio has seriously considered filming a sequel or outright remake.

There have been two short-lived [[television series]] based upon ''Casablanca'', both considered [[prequel]]s. The first aired from 1955 to 1956, with [[Charles McGraw]] as Rick and [[Marcel Dalio]], who played Emil the [[croupier]] in the movie, as Renault; it aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] as part of the [[wheel series]] ''[[Warner Bros. Presents]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0047719/|title=Casablanca (1955)|publisher=Internet Movie Database Inc|accessdate=2007-08-06}}</ref> It produced a total of ten hour-long episodes. Another, briefly broadcast on [[NBC]] in 1983, starred [[David Soul]] as Rick, [[Ray Liotta]] as Sacha, and [[Scatman Crothers]] as a somewhat elderly Sam.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084994/|title=Casablanca (1983)|publisher=Internet Movie Database Inc|accessdate=2007-08-06}}</ref> A total of five hour-long episodes were produced.

There were several radio adaptations of the film. The two best-known were a thirty-minute adaptation on ''[[The Screen Guild Theater]]'' on April 26, 1943, starring Bogart, Bergman, and Henreid, and an hour-long version on the ''[[Lux Radio Theater]]'' on January 24, 1944, featuring [[Alan Ladd]] as Rick, [[Hedy Lamarr]] as Ilsa, and [[John Loder (actor)|John Loder]] as Victor Laszlo. Two other thirty-minute adaptations were aired: on ''Philip Morris Playhouse'' on September 3, 1943, and on ''Theater of Romance'' on December 19, 1944, in which Dooley Wilson reprised his role as Sam.

[[Julius J. Epstein|Julius Epstein]] made two attempts to turn the film into a [[Broadway musical]], in 1951 and 1967, but neither made it to the stage.<ref>{{Harvnb|Harmetz|1992|p=338}}</ref> The original play, ''[[Everybody Comes to Rick's]]'', was produced in [[Newport, Rhode Island]] in August 1946, and again in London in April 1991, but met with no success.<ref>{{Harvnb|Harmetz|1992|p=331}}</ref> The film was adapted into a musical by the [[Takarazuka Revue]], an all-female Japanese musical theater company, and ran from November 2009 through February 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kageki.hankyu.co.jp/casablanca/|title=<U+300E><U+30AB><U+30B5><U+30D6><U+30E9><U+30F3><U+30AB><U+300F>|publisher=Takarazuka Revue Company|accessdate=2009-10-03}}</ref>

===Colorization===

The bottom screenshot has two men, one watching as the other drinks from a glass.|[[Film still|Still]]s from the controversial [[colorized]] version.]]
''Casablanca'' was part of the [[film colorization]] controversy of the 1980s,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,963207,00.html|title=Casablanca In Color?|last=Krauthammer|first=Charles|date=January 12, 1987|publisher=[[Time (magazine)|''Time'']]|accessdate=2007-08-06}}</ref> when a colorized version aired on the television station [[TBS (TV network)|WTBS]]. In 1984, [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM-UA]] hired Color Systems Technology to colorize the film for $180,000.<ref name="EdgertonCasa">{{Cite journal|last=Edgerton|first=Gary R.|title=The Germans Wore Gray, You Wore Blue|journal=[[Journal of Popular Film & Television]]|volume=27|issue=4|page=24|date=Winter 2000|ref=harv|postscript=.}}</ref> When [[Ted Turner]] of [[Turner Entertainment]] purchased MGM-UA's film library two years later, he canceled the request, before contracting American Film Technologies (AFT) in 1988. AFT completed the colorization in two months at a cost of $450,000.<ref name="EdgertonCasa" /> Turner later reacted to the criticism of the colorization, saying, "[''Casablanca''] is one of a handful of films that really doesn't have to be colorized. I did it because I wanted to. All I'm trying to do is protect my investment."<ref name="EdgertonCasa" />

The [[Library of Congress]] deemed that the color change differed so much from the original film that it gave a new copyright to Turner Entertainment. When the colorized film debuted on WTBS, it was watched by three million viewers, not making the top-ten viewed cable shows for the week. Although Jack Matthews of the ''Los Angeles Times'' called the finished product "state of the art", it was mostly met with negative critical reception.<ref name="EdgertonCasa" /> It was briefly available on home video. Gary Edgerton, writing for the ''[[Journal of Popular Film & Television]]'' criticized the colorization, "... ''Casablanca'' in color ended up being much blander in appearance and, overall, much less visually interesting than its 1942 predecessor."<ref name="EdgertonCasa" /> Bogart's son Stephen said, "if you're going to colorize ''Casablanca'', why not put arms on the [[Venus de Milo]]?"<ref name="harmetz342"/>

==Rumors==
Several rumors and misconceptions have grown up around the film, one being that [[Ronald Reagan]] was originally chosen to play Rick. This originates in a press release issued by the [[movie studio|studio]] early on in the film's development, but by that time the studio already knew that he was due to go work for the army, and he was never seriously considered.<ref>{{Harvnb|Harmetz|1992|p=74}}</ref>

Another well-known story is that the actors did not know until the last day of shooting how the film was to end. The original play (set entirely in the cafe) ended with Rick sending Ilsa and Victor to the [[airport]]. During scriptwriting, the possibility was discussed of Laszlo being killed in Casablanca, allowing Rick and Ilsa to leave together, but as Casey Robinson wrote to Hal Wallis before filming began, the ending of the film "set up for a swell twist when Rick sends her away on the plane with Victor. For now, in doing so, he is not just solving a love triangle. He is forcing the girl to live up to the idealism of her nature, forcing her to carry on with the work that in these days is far more important than the love of two little people."<ref>Behlmer, pp. 206<U+2013>207</ref> It was certainly impossible for Ilsa to leave Laszlo for Rick, as the [[United States Motion Picture Production Code of 1930|production code]] forbade showing a woman leaving her husband for another man. The concern was not whether Ilsa would leave with Laszlo, but how this result could be engineered.<ref>{{Harvnb|Harmetz|1992|p=229}}</ref> The confusion was probably caused by Bergman's later statement that she did not know which man she was meant to be in love with. While rewrites did occur during the filming, Aljean Harmetz's examination of the scripts has shown that many of the key scenes were shot after Bergman knew how the film would end: any confusion was, in Ebert's words, "emotional", not "factual".<ref name="Ebertcommentary" />

==Errors and inaccuracies==
The film has several logical flaws, the foremost being the two "letters of transit" which enable their bearers to leave [[Vichy France|Vichy French]] territory. According to the {{Audio|Lettersoftransit.ogg|audio}}, Ugarte says the letters had been signed by (depending on the listener) either [[Free French]] General [[Charles de Gaulle]] or Vichy General [[Maxime Weygand]]. The English subtitles on the official DVD read de Gaulle, while the French subtitles specify Weygand. Weygand had been the Vichy Delegate-General for the [[French colonial empire|North African colonies]] until a month before the film is set (and a year after it was written). De Gaulle was the head of the Free French [[government in exile]]. A Vichy [[court martial]] had convicted de Gaulle of treason ''in absentia'' and sentenced him to life imprisonment on August 2, 1940, so a letter signed by him would have been of no benefit.<ref name="robertson" /> A classic [[MacGuffin]], the letters were invented by Joan Allison for the original play and never questioned.<ref>{{Harvnb|Harmetz|1992|p=55}}</ref> Even in the film, Rick suggests to Renault that the letters would not have allowed Ilsa to escape, let alone Laszlo: "People have been held in Casablanca in spite of their legal rights."

In the same vein, though Laszlo asserts that the Nazis cannot arrest him as "This is still unoccupied France; any violation of neutrality would reflect on Captain Renault," Ebert points out that "It makes no sense that he could walk around freely....He would be arrested on sight."<ref name="Ebertcommentary" /> Harmetz, however, suggests that Strasser intentionally allows Laszlo to move about, hoping that he will tell them the names of Resistance leaders in occupied Europe in exchange for Ilsa being allowed to leave for Lisbon.

Other mistakes include the wrong version of the flag for French Morocco and the fact no uniformed German troops ever set foot in Casablanca during the Second World War.<ref name="robertson" /> There are also the inevitable [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity errors]]; for example, in the final scene, Major Strasser's military overcoat is seen both with and without [[epaulettes]]. In fact, despite being a [[Gestapo]] officer, Major Strasser is seen wearing a [[Luftwaffe]] uniform.  Also, during the scene where Rick leaves Paris on the train, it can clearly be seen that Rick's coat gets sopping wet from the heavy rain, but when he boards the train, the coat suddenly appears dry.

According to Harmetz, in reality few of the refugees depicted would actually have gone to Casablanca.<ref>{{Harvnb|Harmetz|1992|p=208}}</ref> The usual route out of Germany was through [[Vienna]], [[Prague]], Paris, and London, although the film's technical advisor, Robert Aisner, did follow the path to Morocco given in ''Casablanca's'' opening scene.

==Famous quotes==
One of the lines most closely associated with the film <U+2014> "Play it again, Sam" <U+2014> is a [[misquotation]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Movie Misquotations |author=Fred R. Shapiro |newspaper=[[The New York Times Magazine]] |date=January 15, 2010 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/17/magazine/17FOB-onlanguage-t.html}}
</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Darth Vader line is the daddy of film misquotes, finds poll |author=Ben Child |newspaper=[[guardian.co.uk]] |date=11 May 2009 |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2009/may/11/star-wars-movie-misquotes-poll}}</ref>
When Ilsa first enters the Caf<U+00E9> Americain, she spots Sam and asks him to "Play it once, Sam, for old times' sake." When he feigns ignorance, she responds, "Play it, Sam. Play '[[As Time Goes By (song)|As Time Goes By]].'" Later that night, alone with Sam, Rick says, "You played it for her and you can play it for me," and "If she can stand it, I can! Play it!"

Rick's remark to Ilsa, "Here's looking at you, kid," is not in the draft screenplays, but has been attributed to something Bogart said to Bergman as he taught her poker between takes.<ref>{{Harvnb|Harmetz|1992|p=187}}</ref> It was voted fifth most memorable line in cinema in the [[AFI's 100 Years<U+2026>100 Movie Quotes]] by the [[American Film Institute]].<ref>{{cite web | title='Frankly, my dear...' named number one movie quote | url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200506/s1398449.htm | publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] | date=June 23, 2005 | accessdate=2006-11-04}}</ref>

Six lines from ''Casablanca'' appeared in the AFI's movie quotes poll, the most of any film (''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'' and ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' were tied with three apiece). The others were: "Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship." (20th), "Play it, Sam. Play 'As Time Goes By.'" (28th), "Round up the usual suspects." (32nd), "We'll always have Paris." (43rd), and "Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, she walks into mine." (67th).
