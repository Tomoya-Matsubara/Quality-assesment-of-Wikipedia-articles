The '''Beriev Be-103''' is an [[amphibious aircraft|amphibious]] [[seaplane]] designed by the [[Beriev Aircraft Company]] and constructed by the [[Komsomolsk-on-Amur Aircraft Production Association]] (KnAAPO) in [[Russia]]. Intended for autonomous operation in the unmarked areas of Russia's far north and [[Siberia]], the Be-103 was designed for short-haul routes in regions that have rivers, lakes and streams, but are otherwise inaccessible.

==Design and development==
The Be-103 is a mid-wing [[monoplane]], making use of the modified [[wing root]]s as water-displacing [[sponson]]s.<ref name="Water Flying">{{cite web|url=http://www.beriev-usa.com/main/be-103_wfm_ma.pdf|title="Beriev Be-103: The Same, only Different", ''Water Flying'', March/April 2005|accessdate=2010-04-03|format=PDF}}</ref> It features an all-moving [[stabilator|slab tail]] and retractable [[tricycle landing gear]] for land operations. Its hallmark and most distinguishing design feature is the water-displacing wing, an unusual feature for a seaplane, with three aquaplaning implements (planing step, port and starboard wing trailing edges) which substantially enhance the aircraft's on-the-water stability and seaworthiness. 

The Be-103 features include an advanced, blended wing, swept at 22<U+00B0>, with {{convert|11|ft|m|sing=on}}-long fixed [[leading edge slats]], trailing-link main landing gear, and three-bladed [[MT Propeller|MT-12]] reverse pitch [[propeller]]s. Fuel is stored in the [[wet wing]]s. The aircraft is built from [[aluminum-lithium]] alloy with [[titanium]] used in high-stress areas. A 30-parameter, five-hour [[flight data recorder]], engine fire-detection systems and an ice detector are also standard<ref name="AOPA Pilot"/>, as are hydraulic brakes. However, unlike most modern aircraft, the Be-103 is not equipped with [[flap (aircraft)|wing flaps]].<ref name="Water Flying"/>

When flying solo, ballast must be placed near the right front seat due to [[center of gravity]] issues.<ref name="AOPA Pilot"/>

==Certification==
The Be-103 received its [[Federal Aviation Administration]] type certification on 21 July 2003 at the [[EAA AirVenture Oshkosh|EAA AirVenture]] airshow in [[Oshkosh, Wisconsin]], where the aircraft had arrived via [[Antonov An-124|An-124]] airlift<ref name="AOPA Pilot"/>. The type certificate was handed over by the FAA's co-chairman of regulations and certification, Nicholas Sabatini.  The aircraft is also certified in [[Brazil]]<ref>{{cite news |title="Certification of Beriev's BE-103 amphibians in Brazil" |url=http://taganrogcity.com/pr_08252005.html |language=English |publisher=Taganrog Municipality |date=25 August 2005 |accessdate=6 August 2009 }}</ref>, the [[People's Republic of China]]<ref>{{cite news |title="Certification of Beriev's BE-103 amphibians in China has been completed"|url=http://taganrogcity.com/pr_12302005.html |language=English |publisher=Taganrog Municipality |date=25 December 2005 |accessdate=6 August 2009 }}</ref>, the [[European Union]]<ref name="EU Cert">[http://www.beriev.com/images/photo_2008/cert_Be-103_EASA.jpg Type Certificate Data Sheet Nr. IM.A.341]</ref>, and [[Russia]].

On 1 August 2003, FAA Director [[Marion Blakey]] visited the Be-103's display area at the exhibition in order to familiarize herself personally with the aircraft and to meet representatives of the developer, manufacturer and Air Register.

The obtaining of FAA certification alleds official sales of the Be-103 to begin in the USA and [[Canada]]<ref>{{cite news |title="The Certification of Beriev BE-103 Amphibians in Canada" |url=http://taganrogcity.com/pr_05262005.html |language=English |publisher=Taganrog Municipality |date=26 May 2005 |accessdate=6 August 2009 }}</ref>. After the exhibition, the first production Be-103 aircraft were officially handed over to its American dealer, Kent Linn of [[Sky Manor Airport (New Jersey)|Sky Manor Airport]] in [[Pittstown, New Jersey]]. Domestic and international market demands (until 2015) were estimated at 520 and 250-330 units, respectively.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

The Be-103 was the first Russian aircraft to be in the "Normal" category by the FAA. <ref name="AOPA Pilot"/> <!-- the Sukhoi aerobats were registered in the Experimental category -->, and along with the [[Dornier Seawings Seastar]] is the only twin-engine amphibian currently in production.{{citation needed|April 2010}}

==Operators==

As of 2004, three aircraft were on the United States civil register, while later that year China signed a US$20mil contract with KnAAPO for the delivery of 20 aircraft. <ref>Vostok Media ''fide'' [http://www.beriev-usa.com/main/index.html Beriev USA]</ref>
