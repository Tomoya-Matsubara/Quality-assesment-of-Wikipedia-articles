The '''false catshark''' (''Pseudotriakis microdon'') is a [[species]] of [[ground shark]] in the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Pseudotriakidae]], and the sole member of its [[genus]]. It has a worldwide distribution, and has most commonly been recorded close to the bottom over [[continental margin|continental and insular slopes]], at depths of {{convert|500|-|1400|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Reaching {{convert|3.0|m|ft|abbr=on}} in length, this heavy-bodied shark can be readily identified by its elongated, [[keel]]-like first [[dorsal fin]]. It has long, narrow eyes and a large mouth filled with numerous tiny teeth. It is usually dark brown in color, though a few are light gray.

With flabby muscles and a large [[shark liver oil|oily]] [[liver]], the false catshark is a slow-moving [[predator]] and [[scavenging|scavenger]] of a variety of [[fish]]es and [[invertebrate]]s. It has an [[aplacental viviparous]] mode of reproduction, featuring an unusual form of [[oophagy]] in which the developing [[embryo]]s consume [[ovum|ova]] or egg fragments released by the mother and use the yolk material to replenish their external [[yolk sac]]s for later use. This species typically gives birth to two pups at a time. The [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) presently lacks sufficient data to assess the conservation status of the false catshark. While neither targeted by fisheries nor commercially valuable, it is [[bycatch|caught incidentally]] by [[longline fishing|longline]]s and [[bottom trawl]]s, and its low reproductive rate may render it susceptible to population depletion.

==Taxonomy and phylogeny==
The false catshark was first described by Portuguese [[ichthyologist]] F<U+00E9>lix de Brito Capello in the ''Jornal do Sci<U+00EA>ncias Mathem<U+00E1>ticas, Physicas e Naturaes'' in 1868. He based his account on a {{convert|2.3|m|ft|abbr=on}} long adult male caught off [[Setubal]], [[Portugal]].<ref name="brito capello"/> de Brito Capello thought the specimen resembled a member of the genus ''[[Triakis]]'', except lacking a [[nictitating membrane]] (though it is now known that this species does in fact have this trait). Thus, he assigned it to the new genus ''Pseudotriakis'', from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''pseudo'' ("false"). At the time, ''Triakis'' was classified with the [[catshark]]s, hence "false catshark". The [[specific name (zoology)|specific name]] ''microdon'' comes from the Greek ''mikros'' ("small") and ''odontos'' ("tooth").<ref name="castro"/> Other [[common name]]s for this species are dumb shark (from its Japanese name ''oshizame'') and keel-dorsal shark.<ref name="iucn"/><ref name="tinker"/>

Pacific populations of the false catshark were once regarded as a separate species, ''P. acrales''. However, [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] comparisons have failed to find any consistent differences between ''P. microdon'' and ''P. acrales'', leading to the conclusion that there is only one species of false catshark.<ref name="compagno"/><ref name="yano and musick"/> The closest relatives of the false catshark are the [[Gollum (genus)|gollumsharks]] (''Gollum''). ''Pseudotriakis'' and ''Gollum'' share a number of morphological similarities.<ref name="compagno1988"/> [[Phylogenetic]] analysis using [[protein]]-coding [[gene]]s has found that the amount of genetic divergence between these [[taxon|taxa]] is less than that between some other shark species within the same genus. This result suggests that the many [[autapomorphies]] (unique traits) of the false catshark evolved relatively recently, and supports the grouping of ''Pseudotriakis'' and ''Gollum'' together in the family Pseudotriakidae.<ref name="lopez et al"/>

==Description==
{{multiple image |direction=vertical|width=280|image1=Pseudotriakis acrales by jordan and snyder.jpg|image2=Pseudotriakis microdon csiro-nfc.jpg|align=left|caption2=The most distinctive feature of the false catshark is its long, low first dorsal fin.}}
Bulky and soft-bodied, the false catshark has a broad head with a short, rounded snout. The nostrils have large flaps of skin on their anterior rims. The narrow eyes are over twice as long as high, and are equipped with rudimentary nictitating membranes; behind the eyes are large [[spiracle]]s. The huge mouth is arched and bears short furrows at the corners. There are over two hundred rows of tiny teeth in each jaw, arranged in straight lines in the upper jaw and diagonal lines in the lower jaw; each tooth has a pointed central cusp flanked by one or two smaller cusplets on either side. The five pairs of [[gill slit]]s are fairly small.<ref name="castro"/><ref name="compagno"/><ref name="last and stevens"/>

The [[pectoral fin]]s are small and rounded, with [[fin ray]]s only near the base. The first [[dorsal fin]] is highly distinctive, being very long (roughly equal to the [[caudal fin]]) and low, resembling the [[keel]] of a ship; it originates over the pectoral fin rear tips and terminates over the [[pelvic fin]] origins. The second [[dorsal fin]] is larger than, and originates ahead of, the [[anal fin]]; both these fins are positioned very close to the caudal fin. The caudal fin has a long upper lobe with a ventral notch near the tip, and an indistinct lower lobe.<ref name="compagno"/><ref name="last and stevens"/> The [[dermal denticle]]s are shaped like arrowheads with a central ridge, and are sparsely distributed on the skin. This species is typically plain dark brown in color, darkening at the fin margins. However, a few individuals are instead light gray with irregular darker mottling made from fine dots. The false catshark grows up to {{convert|3.0|m|ft|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|125|kg|lb|abbr=on}} in weight.<ref name="castro"/>

==Distribution and habitat==
Though rarely encountered, the false catshark has been caught from locations scattered around the world, indicating a wide circumglobal distribution. In the western [[Atlantic]], it has been reported from [[Canada]], the [[United States]], [[Cuba]], and [[Brazil]]. In the eastern Atlantic, it is known from the waters of [[Iceland]], [[France]], [[Portugal]], and [[Senegal]], as well as the islands of [[Madeira]], the [[Azores]], the [[Canary Islands|Canaries]], and [[Cape Verde]]. Records from the [[Indian Ocean]] have come from off [[Madagascar]], the [[Aldabra Group]], [[Indonesia]], and [[Australia]]. In the [[Pacific Ocean]], it has been documented from [[Japan]], [[Taiwan]], [[Indonesia]], the [[Coral Sea]], [[New Zealand]], and the [[Hawaiian Islands]].<ref name="castro"/><ref name="fishbase"/>

Inhabiting [[continental shelf|continental and insular slopes]], the false catshark mostly occurs between the depths of {{convert|500|and|1400|m|ft|abbr=on}}, though it has been recorded as deep as {{convert|1900|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Individuals occasionally wander into relatively shallower waters over the [[continental shelf]], perhaps following [[submarine canyon]]s or suffering from an abnormal condition. The false catshark generally swims close to the [[sea floor]] and has been found at [[seamount]]s, [[trough (geology)|troughs]], and deepwater [[reef]]s.<ref name="iucn"/><ref name="castro"/><ref name="compagno"/>

==Biology and ecology==
[[Image:Bathygadid.jpg|thumb|Grenadiers are among the prey consumed by the false catshark.]]
The soft fins, skin, and musculature of the false catshark suggest a sluggish lifestyle. An enormous [[shark liver oil|oil]]-filled [[liver]] makes up 18<U+2013>25% of its total weight, allowing it to maintain near-[[neutral buoyancy]] and hover off the bottom with little effort.<ref name="compagno"/><ref name="last and stevens"/> This species likely captures prey via quick bursts of speed, with its large mouth allowing it to consume food of considerable size.<ref name="compagno"/><ref name="yano and musick"/> It feeds mainly on [[bony fish]]es such as [[cutthroat eel]]s, [[rattail|grenadier]]s, and [[snake mackerel]], and also takes [[lanternshark]]s, [[squid]]s, [[octopus]]es, and ''[[Heterocarpus]]'' [[shrimp]].<ref name="iucn"/><ref name="yano and musick"/> It likely also [[scavenging|scavenges]], as examination of stomach contents have found surface-dwelling fishes such as [[frigate mackerel]], [[needlefish]]es, and [[pufferfish]]es. One specimen caught off the Canary Islands had swallowed human garbage, including [[potato]]es, a [[pear]], a [[plastic bag]], and a [[soft drink can]].<ref name="yano and musick"/> There is a record of a false catshark found with bite marks from a [[great white shark]] (''Carcharodon carcharias'').<ref name="tirard et al"/>

Unusual among the ground sharks, the false catshark is [[aplacental viviparous]] with the developing [[embryo]]s practicing intrauterine [[oophagy]]. Adult females have a single functional [[ovary]], on the right, and two functional [[uterus]]es.<ref name="yano"/> A female {{convert|2.4|m|ft|abbr=on}} long was found to contain an estimated 20,000 [[ovum|ova]] in her ovary, averaging {{convert|9|mm|in|abbr=on}} across. During [[gestation]], the developing embryos are initially nourished by [[yolk]], and later transition to feeding on ova or egg fragments [[ovulation|ovulated]] by the mother. Excess egg material ingested by the embryo is stored within its external [[yolk sac]]; when close to birth, the embryo then transfers the yolk from the external yolk sac into an internal yolk sac to serve as a post-birth food reserve.<ref name="yano"/> The typical litter size is two pups, one per uterus, though litters of four may be possible.<ref name="compagno"/> The [[gestation period]] is probably longer than one year, possibly lasting two or three years. Newborns measure {{convert|1.2|-|1.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} long.<ref name="iucn"/> Males and females probably [[sexual maturity|mature sexually]] at around {{convert|2.0|-|2.6|m|ft|abbr=on}} and {{convert|2.1|-|2.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} long respectively.<ref name="castro"/><ref name="compagno"/>

==Human interactions==
The false catshark is an infrequent [[bycatch]] of [[longline fishing|longlines]] and [[bottom trawl]]s. It has minimal economic value, though its meat, fins, and liver oil may be utilized.<ref name="iucn"/><ref name="fishbase"/> In [[Okinawa]], its oil is traditionally used to seal the hulls of wooden fishing boats.<ref name="last and stevens"/> Like other deepwater sharks, this species is thought to be highly susceptible to [[overfishing]] due to its slow reproductive rate. However, it is rarely caught and there is no information available on its population. Therefore, the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) has listed it as [[Data Deficient]].<ref name="iucn"/>
