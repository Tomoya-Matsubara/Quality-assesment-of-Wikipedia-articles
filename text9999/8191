'''John Wemyss "Jake" Seamer''' (23 June 1913 <U+2013> 16 April 2006) was an [[Amateur status in first-class cricket|amateur]] [[cricket]]er who played for [[Oxford University Cricket Club|Oxford University]] and [[Somerset County Cricket Club|Somerset]] either side of the Second World War. A bespectacled cricketer, Seamer was a right-handed batsman who played with a defensive streak to his game which was rarely seen among amateur batsmen of his time. He was described as a [[leg break]] [[googly]] bowler, but in truth he rarely bowled at all, and claimed just four first-class wickets.

Seamer played the best of his cricket while at [[Oxford University]]. All four of his first-class centuries were made for the university side, and his average for Oxford was 35.30, significantly higher than his career average of 20.35. He made his highest score against Free Foresters in his second year, during which he accrued 858 runs, more than double he managed in any other season. On completion of his studies at Oxford, Seamer joined the Sudan Political Service, which limited his first-class cricket appearances to periods of [[Leave (military)|leave]]. He was named as one of three amateurs to captain Somerset in 1948, leading the team during June and July. That season was his last for Somerset, and he made only one further first-class appearance. He became a district commissioner in the [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan|Sudan]], and after leaving the service, he taught at [[Marlborough College]] and was twice [[mayor]] of [[Marlborough]].

==Early life==
Jake Seamer was born in [[Shapwick, Somerset|Shapwick]], [[Somerset]] on 23 June 1913.<ref name="ciprof">{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/england/content/player/20095.html |title=Player Profile: Jake Seamer |publisher=[[ESPNcricinfo]] |accessdate=2011-06-05}}</ref> The son of a vicar, Seamer had two secret career wishes in his youth; he wanted to be either an actor or, failing that, a [[county cricket]]er.<ref name="TWCobit">{{cite journal |last=Foot |first=David |year=2006 |month=July |title=Jake Seamer 1913<U+2013>2006 |journal=[[The Wisden Cricketer]] |volume=3 |issue=10 |page=83 |chapter=Extras: Obituaries |location=London, England |publisher=Wisden Cricketer Publishing Ltd |editor1-first=Stern |editor1-last=John |issn=1740-9519}}</ref> He attended [[Marlborough College]] in [[Wiltshire]], and played for the school's cricket team from 1930 to 1932.<ref name="om">{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/3/3809/Other_matches.html |title=Other matches played by Jake Seamer (19) |publisher=[[CricketArchive]] |accessdate=2011-06-05}}</ref> His performances for his school led to his selection for "Lord's Schools" in match against "The Rest" at [[Lord's Cricket Ground]], in which he scored 33 runs in the first innings and 3 runs in the second, remaining [[not out]] on both occasions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/303/303005.html |title=Lord's Schools v The Rest: Other matches in England 1932 |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=2011-06-05}}</ref> Following that match he also appeared for a representative Public Schools side against the [[British Army cricket team|Army]] at Lord's, but his batting was less successful, failing to reach double figures in either innings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/135/135955.html |title=Army v Public Schools: Other matches in England 1932 |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=2011-06-05}}</ref>

During the summer between graduating from Marlborough College and going up to [[Oxford University]], Seamer made his [[county cricket]] debut, playing three matches for [[Somerset County Cricket Club]]. In his first match for Somerset, played against [[Derbyshire County Cricket Club|Derbyshire]], he played as a specialist batsman at number eight in the [[Batting order (cricket)|batting order]]. He came in to bat when Somerset had lost six wickets for the addition of 88 runs, and together with his captain, [[Reggie Ingle]], helped Somerset to recover. The pair put on a [[Partnership (cricket)|partnership]] of 104 runs, and Seamer scored 70 runs in his debut innings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/14/14471.html |title=Somerset v Derbyshire: County Championship 1932 |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=2011-06-05}}</ref> In both his other matches for the county that season, Seamer batted as part of the top order, and though he reached double figures in each of his innings, he did not achieve another half-century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cricketarchive.com/cgi-bin/player_oracle_reveals_results2.cgi?playernumber=3809&testing=0&opponentmatch=exact&playername=Jake%20Seamer&resulttype=All&matchtype=All&teammatch=exact&startwicket=&homeawaytype=All&opponent=&endwicket=&wicketkeeper=&searchtype=InningsList&howout=All&endscore=&playermatch=contains&branding=cricketarchive&captain=&endseason=1932&startscore=&team=&startseason=1930 |title=Player Oracle Reveals Results: JW Seamer from 1930 to 1932 |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=2011-06-05}}</ref>

==University years==
Following his graduation from Marlborough College, Seamer attended [[Brasenose College, Oxford|Brasenose College]], [[Oxford University]].<ref>Bolton (1962), p. 365.</ref> He played just one [[First-class cricket|first-class]] match for the university in his freshman year, appearing against [[Worcestershire County Cricket Club|Worcestershire]] at [[University Parks|The Parks]]. He scored 33 before being [[run out]] in his only innings, and also bowled six overs, though without claiming a wicket.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/14/14576.html |title=Oxford University v Worcestershire: University Match 1933 |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=2011-06-05}}</ref> He appeared eleven times for Somerset that year, but despite regular scores of 20 or more, he did not score a half-century, and [[Batting average#Cricket|averaged]] 13.06 runs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cricketarchive.com/cgi-bin/player_oracle_reveals_results2.cgi?playernumber=3809&testing=0&opponentmatch=exact&playername=Jake%20Seamer&resulttype=All&matchtype=All&teammatch=exact&startwicket=&homeawaytype=All&opponent=&endwicket=&wicketkeeper=&searchtype=InningsList&howout=All&endscore=&playermatch=contains&branding=cricketarchive&captain=&endseason=1933&startscore=&team=Somerset&startseason=1933 |title=Player Oracle Reveals Results: JW Seamer where team is Somerset from 1933 to 1933 |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=2011-06-05}}</ref>

In his second year at Oxford, Seamer played as part of a strong batting line-up for the university: [[Fredrick de Saram]] passed 1,000 runs for the side, while [[Mandy Mitchell-Innes]] fell just two runs short of the landmark. Seamer, despite scoring over three hundred runs less than either, finished second in the batting averages for the year with 51.76. He scored three centuries for the university, passing one hundred runs against the [[Free Foresters Cricket Club|Free Foresters]], the [[Minor counties of English and Welsh cricket|Minor Counties]] and the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] (MCC).<ref name="OUCC1934">Bolton (1962), pp. 281<U+2013>5.</ref> His score of 194, made against the Free Foresters was the highest first-class total of Seamer's career, and the three centuries he scored during 1934 were remarkable for the fact that he only scored one other first-class century during his career.<ref name="ciprof"/> Seamer earned his cricketing [[Blue (university sport)|Blue]] in 1934, appearing in the [[The University Match (cricket)|University match]] against [[Cambridge University Cricket Club|Cambridge University]]. He was dismissed for a [[Duck (cricket)|duck]] in the first innings, but batted with resolve in the second. He remained at the crease with the [[Batting order (cricket)#Lower order or tail|tail]] for over two hours, eventually being not out on 24, to help Oxford force a draw.<ref name="OUCC1934"/> Seamer found batting more difficult in the [[County Championship]]: in thirteen innings for Somerset in 1934, he passed 50 once, against [[Kent County Cricket Club|Kent]], and averaged 16.81, significantly lower than his total for Oxford.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cricketarchive.com/cgi-bin/player_oracle_reveals_results2.cgi?playernumber=3809&testing=0&opponentmatch=exact&playername=Jake%20Seamer&resulttype=All&matchtype=All&teammatch=exact&startwicket=&homeawaytype=All&opponent=&endwicket=&wicketkeeper=&searchtype=InningsList&howout=All&endscore=&playermatch=contains&branding=cricketarchive&captain=&endseason=1934&startscore=&team=Somerset&startseason=1934 |title=Player Oracle Reveals Results: JW Seamer where team is Somerset from 1934 to 1934 |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=2011-06-05}}</ref>

In Seamer's final year at Oxford, he only appeared in three matches: he was not required to bat in either innings against the Free Foresters, and only batted once against [[Leicestershire County Cricket Club|Leicestershire]], scoring 5 runs. His final match was the University match against Cambridge, and as in the previous year, Oxford suffered a heavy defeat. Seamer scored 11 runs in the first innings, and then when Oxford were asked to [[follow on]], he batted tenaciously to reach 43 runs,<ref>Bolton (1962), p. 290.</ref> which forced Cambridge to bat again. Requiring 17 runs to win, Cambridge chased the total down in 5.4 overs with eight wickets to spare.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/15/15885.html |title=Oxford University v Cambridge University: University Match 1936 |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=2011-06-05}}</ref> In total, Seamer played 21 matches for Oxford, scoring 1,059 runs at an average of 35.30.<ref name="bbs">{{cite web|url=http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/3/3809/f_Batting_by_Team.html |title=First-class Batting and Fielding For Each Team by Jake Seamer |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=2011-06-05}}</ref> Seamer also won a Blue in [[Field hockey|hockey]], in which he captained Oxford for a time.<ref name="TWCobit"/>

==County cricket==
On the completion of his studies at Oxford, Seamer joined the [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan|Sudan]] Political Service. He continued to play cricket for Somerset during his periods of leave, but it dramatically reduced his availability for the county.<ref name="TWCobit"/> During his time at Oxford, Seamer had become good friends with Mitchell-Innes; the pair both attended the same college, and played together for both the university and Somerset.<ref>Foot (1986), p. 128.</ref> When Mitchell-Innes graduated from Oxford the year after Seamer, he joined his friend in the Sudan, where the pair often organised cricket matches, despite the extreme heat.<ref name="TWCobit"/> Seamer's duties prevented him from playing for Somerset at all during 1937, but he appeared eight times the following year through May and early June.<ref name="fcm">{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/3/3809/First-Class_Matches.html |title=First-Class Matches played by Jake Seamer (81) |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=2011-06-06}}</ref> His average that season was the highest he achieved after leaving university, recording 20.78 from his 14 innings,<ref name="bbs"/> though his highest score was 47 runs, scored against Derbyshire.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cricketarchive.com/cgi-bin/player_oracle_reveals_results2.cgi?playernumber=3809&testing=0&opponentmatch=exact&playername=Jake%20Seamer&resulttype=All&matchtype=All&teammatch=exact&startwicket=&homeawaytype=All&opponent=&endwicket=&wicketkeeper=&searchtype=InningsList&howout=All&endscore=&playermatch=contains&branding=cricketarchive&captain=&endseason=1938&startscore=&team=Somerset&startseason=1938 |title=Player Oracle Reveals Results: JW Seamer where team is Somerset from 1938 to 1938 |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=2011-06-06}}</ref> In 1939, the last season of first-class county cricket in England before the Second World War, Seamer played seven times for Somerset. However, unlike his appearances the previous year, in which he had generally batted as part of the top order, Seamer predominantly appeared in the middle order for the county in 1939, and his highest score was 28.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cricketarchive.com/cgi-bin/player_oracle_reveals_results2.cgi?playernumber=3809&testing=0&opponentmatch=exact&playername=Jake%20Seamer&resulttype=All&matchtype=All&teammatch=exact&startwicket=&homeawaytype=All&opponent=&endwicket=&wicketkeeper=&searchtype=InningsList&howout=All&endscore=&playermatch=contains&branding=cricketarchive&captain=&endseason=1939&startscore=&team=Somerset&startseason=1939 |title=Player Oracle Reveals Results: JW Seamer where team is Somerset from 1939 to 1939 |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=2011-06-06}}</ref>
