== History ==
Betsson was founded by Fredrik Sidfalk, Henrik Bergquist and Anders Holmgren, in the beginning of 2001, and obtained an official bookmaker license in London in April [[2002]].<ref name="history">{{cite web |url=https://www.betsson.com/en/about/company-information/company-history/index.asp |title=Company History - Betsson |accessdate=2008-02-19}}</ref> The Betsson site was launched in May 2002 in English and Swedish. One month later, Betsson began offering live betting on its [[betting exchange]]. Expansion was brisk, with sites for [[Finland]] and [[Germany]] added together with an online [[casino]]. In [[2004]], Betsson grew to include [[Norway]] and the [[Czech Republic]] and in July 2004, Betsson [[Poker]] was launched in collaboration with partner [[bwin|Ongame]].<ref name="history" />

In March 2005, Betsson reached the 100,000 registered customers milestone.<ref name="history" /> The company grew further by launching sites in [[Turkey]], [[Iceland]] and [[Denmark]]. In April 2005, Betsson became a fully owned subsidiary company of [[Betsson AB|Cherry F<U+00F6>retagen AB]]<ref name="history" />, quoted on the Swedish stock exchange. The same year marked the launch of the [[sports betting]] and [[mobile gambling|mobile poker]] products, a Java applet making it possible to play poker on their mobile phone against the same players and in the same network as on the site.

By January 2006, Betsson, including the company<U+2019>s online casinos had reached more than 400,000 registered customers and the decision was made to move the main headquarters from London to [[Malta]].<ref name="history" />. Betsson launched their fifth main product, Scratch Card Trio, and [[Turkish Poker]] in 2006. The Betsson site was chosen as the best sports and betting website by the magazine [[Internetworld]] <ref name="internetworld_betsson">{{cite web |url=http://internetworld.idg.se/2.1006/1.54404 |title=Internet World Sweden (in Swedish) |accessdate=2008-09-04 |lang=sv}}</ref>. 

In March 2007 Betsson launched [[online bingo]] on the Swedish market and live betting in the [[Sportsbook]]. A few months later in May 2007, Betsson opened sites in [[France]], followed by [[Greece]], [[Italy]] and [[Spain]]. A popular customer loyalty programme called Betsson Points was also launched.

[[Financial betting]] with floating odds was launched in October 2007 under the brand name Betsson Trader. Online games followed in December 2007 further expanding the product portfolio to 9 products. 

The geographic expansion continued in 2008 and in January Betsson entered South America, launching its first South American site in [[Peru]] while launching new sites in [[Serbia]] and the [[Netherlands]]. Betsson reached the 1,000,000 registered clients milestone in 2008.

Betsson branched out to a bricks and mortar presence in May 2008, when it opened a betting shop in Stockholm, challenging the Swedish state gambling monopoly claiming support from the laws of the European Union.<ref name="betting_shop_stockholm">{{cite web |url=http://www.betssonab.com/en/News/Betsson-challenges-Swedish-gaming-monopoly--opens-betting-shop-in-Stockholm-/ |title=Betsson challenges Swedish gaming monopoly  |accessdate=2008-09-04}}</ref>
