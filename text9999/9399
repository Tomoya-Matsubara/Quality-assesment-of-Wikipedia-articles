{{Financial crisis}}
'''Single Supervisory Mechanism''' (SSM) is the tentative term for the mechanism through which, per the [[European Commission]]'s proposal, the [[European Central Bank]] shall assume "ultimate responsibility for specific supervisory tasks related to the financial stability of all [[Euro]] area [[bank]]s."<ref name=eu>[http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/12/953 "Commission proposes new ECB powers for banking supervision as part of a banking union"],  European Union official website, 12 September 2012</ref>

==Proposal==
On 12 September 2012, the [[European Commission]] revealed a proposal, on the basis of article 127(6) of the [[Treaty of Lisbon]]<ref name=mon>[http://www.economonitor.com/blog/2012/09/first-the-governance-then-the-guarantees/?utm_source=contactology&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=EconoMonitor%20Highlights%3A%20Try%20to%20Act%20Surprised "First the Governance, Then the Guarantees"], by Ivo Arnold, ''[[Nouriel Roubini|EconoMonitor]]'', 19 September 2012</ref> that would assign the supervision of the [[Eurozone]] area's [[bank]]s to the [[European Central Bank]]. The Commission called on the [[European Council|Council]] and the [[European Parliament]] to adopt the proposal "by the end of 2012," together with other components of what is intended to be "an integrated ''banking union''." An important part of this integration would be the adoption of a "single rulebook in the form of capital requirements,...harmonized deposit protection schemes...and a single European recovery and resolution framework."<ref name=eu/>

President of the European Commission [[Jos<U+00E9> Manuel Barroso]] stated that the proposed mechanism "will restore confidence in the supervision of all banks in the euro area," emphasizing that the European Union intends to "break the vicious link between sovereigns and their banks." 

"In the future," Barroso added, "bankers' losses should no longer become the people's debt, putting into doubt the financial stability of whole countries."<ref name=eu/> 

The EU's [[European Commissioner for Internal Market and Services|Internal Market Commissioner]] [[Michel Barnier]] stated that the "ultimate aim is to stop using taxpayers' money to bail out banks," adding "We...made sure that the ECB will be accountable to the [[European Parliament]] for supervisory decisions".<ref name=eu/>

==Reactions==
ECB "welcomed" the proposal, <ref name=ecb>[http://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2012/html/pr120912.en.html "ECB welcomes Commission<U+2019>s proposal for a single supervisory mechanism"], ECB press release, 12 September 2012</ref> but [[Chancellor of Germany]] [[Angela Merkel]] questioned "the capacity of ECB to monitor 6,000 banks."<ref name=hel>[http://www.helsinkitimes.fi/news/index.php/finland/finland-news/politics/3588-rehn-schedule-for-single-supervisory-mechanism-feasible "Rehn: Schedule for single supervisory mechanism feasible"], ''[[Helsinki Times]]'', 13 September 2012</ref> The vice-president of the European Commission, [[Olli Rehn]], responded that the majority of European banks would still be monitored by national supervisory bodies, while "ECB would assume ultimate responsibility over the supervision, in order to prevent banking crises from escalating."<ref name=hel/>

The [[European Banking Federation]] (EBF), representing the interests of over five thousand European banks in 31 countries, with its members combining assets of over 30,000 billion Euro and around 2.4 million employees, stated that it welcomes the European Commission<U+2019>s proposals and supports "the clear commitment towards a single rule book". Guido Ravoet], EBF Chief Executive stated that the federation remains "keenly aware" that further steps will be required to create "a common resolution mechanism and a harmonised deposit guarantee framework," which EBF considers as "necessary to complete an effective single supervisory mechanism."<ref name=ebf>[http://www.ebf-fbe.eu/uploads/D1629-%20press%20releas%20-SSM%2012%20Sept%20final.pdf "EBF welcomes steps towards Single Supervisor"], EBF press releae, 12 September 23012</ref>

According to BBC reports, Britain does not want to take part in the Single Supervisory Mechanism, but will support the idea of a single supervisor for the [[Eurozone]], "as long as it does not affect the integrity of the wider EU single market."<ref name=bbc/>

Some economists remained skeptical, some pointing out to the composition of the SSM board as an issue in itself.<ref name=eco>[http://www.economonitor.com/blog/2012/09/first-the-governance-then-the-guarantees/ "First the Governance, Then the Guarantees"], by Ivo Arnold, ''[[Nouriel Roubini|EconoMonitor]]'', 19 September 2012</ref> The Commission proposes a board consisting of a  total of 23 members, with 17 representatives of bank supervisors of member-states, one chairman, one vice-chairman and four other members. Thus, a large majority of the SSM board would consist of national supervisors who "do not appreciate ECB interference in their daily national supervisory activities."<ref name=eco/>
==Aspirations==
On the occasion of the Commission's SSM proposal, Commission President [[Jos<U+00E9> Manuel Barroso]], addressing the EU parliament in [[Strasbourg]], called for the EU to evolve into a "[[federation]] of nation-states".<ref name=bbc/> Barroso said he was not calling for a "[[superstate]]", but rather "a democratic federation of nation states that can tackle our common problems, through the sharing of [[sovereignty]]," acknowledging that such a federation "will ultimately require a new [[treaty]]."<ref name=bbc>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-19568781 "EU Commission chief Barroso calls for 'federation'"], BBC News, 12 September 2012</ref>
