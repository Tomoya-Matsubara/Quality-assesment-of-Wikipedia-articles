In 1984, he spent the summer training in [[San Diego, California]], before returning to Germany to perform his army service.

There are not too many other countries where the people are so patriotic. I really enjoy this about America." Peters continues to live in the San Diego area with his wife, Shannon.<ref name=NBC>{{cite web|url=http://www.2008.nbcolympics.com/athletes/athlete=1362/bio/index.html|title=Athletes: Steffen Peters: Bio|publisher=NBC Universal|accessdate=7 June 2013}}</ref> Their large dressage barn is home to approximately 65 horses as of 2012, around half of which the couple trains and the other half of which are in training under other riders.
