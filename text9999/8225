'''"Homesick"''' is a song by the [[Contemporary Christian music|contemporary Christian]] band [[MercyMe]]. Written by [[Bart Millard]], the song is an expression of grief and longing that was written after the band experienced the deaths of nine people they were connected to in a short period of time. "Homesick" was included on MercyMe's third studio album ''[[Undone (MercyMe album)|Undone]]'' and was released as the second single from that album. 

"Homesick" received positive critical reception, with some critics considering the song one of the best off of ''Undone''. "Homesick" was successful on both Christian and mainstream radio, peaking at the top on the ''[[Radio & Records]]'' Christian AC Indicator and Soft AC/INSPO charts, number 3 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Christian Songs]] and [[Hot Christian AC]] charts and the ''Radio & Records'' Christian AC chart, as well as peaking at number 9 on the ''Billboard'' [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Adult Contemporary]] chart. It was ranked at number 13 on the ''Billboard'' 2005 year-end Hot Christian Songs and Hot Christian AC charts, and at number 20 on the year-end Adult Contemporary chart.

Some comparisons have been made between the lyrical content of "Homesick" and MercyMe's 2001 single "[[I Can Only Imagine]]." David Jenison of [[CCM Magazine]] referred to the song as the 'sequel' to "I Can Only Imagine."<ref name="MercyMe: Breathing Deeply">{{cite web|url=http://www.crosswalk.com/culture/music/a-severe-mercy-1263515.html|title=MercyMe: Breathing Deeply|last=Jenison|first=David|date=23 May 2006|work=[[Crosswalk.com]]|publisher=[[Salem Web Network]]|accessdate=23 September 2011}}</ref> Regarding these comparisons, Millard said "<U+2019>I Can Only Imagine<U+2019> took the focus off of what you are going through and was comforting because it put the focus on where they were going... <U+2019>Homesick<U+2019> is the opposite because it completely addresses us that are left here. I don<U+2019>t think as a Christian that it<U+2019>s right for me to say, <U+2018>I wish you could<U+2019>ve stayed here,<U+2019> because truthfully, we<U+2019>re getting the raw end of the deal if we really believe what we say that heaven is as great as we want it to be. The whole idea is that we<U+2019>re the ones who have to wait.<U+201D><ref name="Meet & Greet">{{cite web|url=http://www.crosswalk.com:80/church/worship/meet-and-greet-mercyme-1263817.html?p=2|title=Meet & Greet: MercyMe|last=Nentwig|first=Wendy Lee|date=20 May 2004|work=[[Crosswalk.com]]|publisher=[[Salem Web Network]]|accessdate=23 September 2011}}</ref> Millard has also noted, "The difference with <U+2018>Homesick<U+2019> [as compared to "I Can Only Imagine"] is that it talks about those who are stuck around here after someone passes away. When you lose somebody, you learn what being homesick is really about."<ref name="A Severe Mercy" />
