The '''Battle of San Lorenzo''' was fought on February 3, 1813 in [[San Lorenzo, Santa Fe|San Lorenzo]], Argentina, then part of the [[United Provinces of the R<U+00ED>o de la Plata]]. A [[Royalist (Spanish American Revolution)|Spanish Royalist]] army under the command of [[Antonio Zabala]] was defeated by the [[Regiment of Mounted Grenadiers (Argentina)|Regiment of Mounted Grenadiers]], under the command of [[Jos<U+00E9> de San Mart<U+00ED>n]]. This battle was the [[baptism of fire]] for this military unit, and for San Mart<U+00ED>n in the [[Spanish American wars of independence]].

[[Montevideo]], a royalist stronghold during the [[Argentine War of Independence]], was under siege by [[Jos<U+00E9> Gervasio Artigas]]. The city raided population centres along the nearby rivers for supplies. Jos<U+00E9> de San Mart<U+00ED>n, who shortly before had arrived in Buenos Aires and formed the regiment, followed the royalist ships to San Lorenzo. The area around San Lorenzo formed a large empty plain, the regiment hid inside the [[San Carlos convent]] during the night and San Mart<U+00ED>n studied the battlefield and the enemy ships from the tower. The battle started at the dawn whereupon the grenadiers made a surprise [[pincer movement]] to trap the enemy forces. One column was led by San Mart<U+00ED>n, and the other by Justo Germ<U+00E1>n Berm<U+00FA>dez. The Royalists were led by Antonio Zabala. San Mart<U+00ED>n fell from his horse, and was nearly killed, but [[Juan Bautista Cabral]] and [[Juan Bautista Baigorria]] intervened and saved him. The royalists were defeated, but kept raiding villages for some more time afterwards.

This battle was the only one that San Mart<U+00ED>n fought on the modern territory of Argentina. The city of San Lorenzo keeps historic memorials of the battle and it is referenced in the [[San Lorenzo march]].

==Prelude==
[[File:San Lorenzo en la Cuenca del Plata.png|thumb|Location of [[San Lorenzo, Santa Fe|San Lorenzo]], [[Buenos Aires]] and [[Montevideo]] at [[La Plata Basin]].]]
Although Buenos Aires had suffered a difficult period in its war for independence, its prospects were improving by 1812. Even though the defeats of [[Manuel Belgrano]] during the [[Paraguay campaign]] and [[Juan Jos<U+00E9> Castelli]] in the [[first Upper Peru campaign]] had generated a political crisis, Belgrano's victory at Tucuman had given new fresh hope to the revolution, which would be strengthened shortly afterwards with the victory at the [[Battle of Salta]]. Montevideo, capital of the [[Viceroyalty of the R<U+00ED>o de la Plata]] since the [[May Revolution]], was under siege by both an army from Buenos Aires led by [[Jos<U+00E9> Rondeau]] and an Uruguayan one led by [[Jos<U+00E9> Gervasio Artigas]]. The city, however, maintained its [[naval supremacy]] over Buenos Aires and their ships raided the coasts of the [[Paran<U+00E1> River|Paran<U+00E1>]] and [[Uruguay river|Uruguay]] rivers to gather supplies, despite the siege.<ref>Mitre, p. 105-106</ref> Montevideo organized a navy to destroy the gun batteries at Rosario and Diamante, two population centers along the Parana, but were prevented from doing so as Buenos Aires dismantled them knowing that they could not defend them.<ref name="uno cero seis">Mitre, p. 106</ref>

The Royalist expeditionary navy that would raid San Lorenzo comprised eleven ships of varying sizes, two hundred and fifty soldiers and fifty sailors.<ref name="uno cero seis"/> They moved into the Paran<U+00E1> through its tributary, the [[Paran<U+00E1> Guaz<U+00FA> River]], slowed down by headwinds. The [[Second Triumvirate (Argentina)|Second Triumvirate]] promoted [[Jos<U+00E9> de San Mart<U+00ED>n]] to colonel<ref>Galasso, p. 89</ref> and instructed him to follow them with the [[Regiment of Mounted Grenadiers (Argentina)|Regiment of Mounted Grenadiers]] and stop the raids. San Mart<U+00ED>n was influenced by [[Napoleonic weaponry and warfare|Napoleonic warfare]] and trained the regiment with the most recent military techniques used in the [[Napoleonic Wars]].<ref name="Galasso, p. 92">Galasso, p. 92</ref>

San Mart<U+00ED>n moved the regiment from Retiro to Rosario, nearing the river at [[San Pedro, Buenos Aires Province|San Pedro]] and [[San Nicol<U+00E1>s de los Arroyos|San Nicol<U+00E1>s]]. He was following the Spanish ships and moved at night to avoid detection. San Mart<U+00ED>n had one hundred and twenty men for this action, reinforced at Rosario by a militia of seventy men under the command of Celedonio Escalada.<ref name="Camogli, p. 74">Camogli and Privitellio, p. 74</ref> Those reinforcements included twenty two rifleman, thirty cavalry, a small cannon and men armed with knives.<ref name="uno cero siete">Mitre, p. 107</ref> Escalada had made other actions against the royalists before this battle. San Mart<U+00ED>n discovered that the royalists intended to pillage the [[San Carlos Convent]] and pressed the march to arrive there first. A hundred royalists landed on San Lorenzo, but the only food available to them was some chickens and watermelons. Aware of the risk of pillage, the population had removed the cattle from the area before the royalists arrived.<ref name="uno cero siete"/> Escalada arrived in San Lorenzo before the bulk of the patriot army, but the dust trail from the path to Rosario revealed their presence. Escalada attacked them but their ship had a longer range than his cannon, keeping him at bay. He was forced to retire when he found a Paraguayan prisoner who had escaped from the ship. The Paraguayan disclosed the size of the royalist army and their plan of attacking the convent with a larger force, suspecting that the local money was kept in it. They did not attack the convent right away, requiring time to prepare the two field cannons. Escalada returned with San Martin and relayed the news. The march from Retiro to the convent took only five days, thanks to the cadet <U+00C1>ngel Pacheco. Pacheco moved ahead of the regiment and prepared horses in advance at the relay positions.<ref name="Camogli, p. 74"/> The whole army arrived on scene during the night of 2 February and hid inside the convent.<ref>Galasso, p. 91</ref> They entered through the rear door and were not allowed to light fires or speak during the night. San Mart<U+00ED>n studied the enemy and the battlefield from the convent's tower, using a [[monocular]].<ref name="uno cero nueve"/>

==Battlefield==
[[File:Campo de la Gloria.JPG|thumb|The ''"Field of Glory"'' at [[San Lorenzo, Santa Fe]], site of the battle. The [[San Carlos Convent]] and the monument of the battle are seen in the background.]]
The battle was fought at the location of the modern city of [[San Lorenzo, Santa Fe]] which is next to the [[Paran<U+00E1> River]], at the point of its widest flow. The west bank of the river was tall and steep, forming a natural obstacle, and ships could only land troops and materials on that side of the river using man-made paths cut into the side. The battlefield was near one of these paths, shaped like a ladder, after which the terrain was a big plain with scattered bushes. The [[San Carlos Convent]], the main nearby building, was a short distance away from the river.<ref name="uno cero siete"/> 

The location was not an easy place to defend without artillery, as the plains made surprise attacks difficult. Except for the convent itself, the terrain did not offer any [[natural barrier]]s that the patriots could exploit. Nevertheless, the flat terrain was ideal for cavalry manoeuvres, and the distance between the church and the west gully gave enough room for a cavalry charge.<ref name="uno cero nueve">Mitre, p. 109</ref> The royalists, on the other hand, could support their troops with their ships from the river. Without a supporting navy, or local batteries, San Mart<U+00ED>n had no means to attack the ships. Although the small path allowed them passage to the ships, it could force the royalist forces to bottleneck during a retreat while the long range guns of the ships protected them.<ref name="uno cero nueve"/> San Mart<U+00ED>n studied the battlefield and readied the plan for the operation during the night, when the grenadiers were hidden inside the convent.

==Battle==
The grenadiers left the convent at dawn, preparing their formations behind the convent. San Mart<U+00ED>n returned to the tower to watch the enemy who disembarked at sunrise, 5:30 in the morning. He mounted his horse, gave a short harangue to the troops, and headed to battle. His strategy was to divide his cavalry forces into two columns, of nearly sixty horsemen each, and make a surprise [[pincer movement]] to trap the enemy forces.<ref>Galasso, p. 91-92</ref> The cavalry would not use their guns, relying instead on [[sabre|saber]] and spear attacks.<ref name="Mitre, p. 110">Mitre, p. 110</ref> The right-hand column was headed by [[Justo Berm<U+00FA>dez]], and the left-hand one by San Mart<U+00ED>n.<ref name="Camogli, p. 74"/> The royalists marched in two columns with the two cannons, a deployed flag and [[military drummer]]s. The [[Clarion (instrument)|clarion]] of the regiment of mounted grenadiers sounded for the first time, marking the beginning of the battle.

San Mart<U+00ED>n's column was the first one to reach the enemy. The two cannons and the cannon fire from the ships defended the royalists, but they were quickly outmanoeuvred by the saber attacks and, unable to form a [[Infantry square|square]], had to retreat. The advantage of surprise and the speed of the [[cavalry charge]] allowed the regiment to defeat the larger royalist army who had almost double the amount of soldiers.<ref name="Galasso, p. 92">Galasso, p. 92</ref> When Berm<U+00FA>dez and his column joined the battle the royalists were not able to stand their ground and were [[rout]]ed, retreating in disarray under covering fire from the ships. Bermudez led the attack at this point as San Mart<U+00ED>n had [[#Cabral's intervention|fallen from his horse]].<ref>Mitre, p. 112</ref>

San Mart<U+00ED>n did not mention Escalada in his first battle report, leading initial historians to infer that they stayed within the convent during the battle.<ref name="Mitre, p. 110"/> However it is currently considered that they took part in the battle, as suggested by the royalist battle report and a later report from San Martin which clarifies that only twelve grenadiers stayed in the convent.<ref name="nueve tres"/> 

The combat took around fifteen minutes and left forty royalists dead and many injured, including Zabala. Fourteen patriot grenadiers died in the combat and two more would die afterwards due to combat injuries.<ref name="Galasso, p. 92"/> [[Manuel D<U+00ED>az V<U+00E9>lez]] fell from his horse in the gully, was mortally injured and captured by the royalists. Berm<U+00FA>dez was shot in the [[patella]] and died a few days later. [[Hip<U+00F3>lito Bouchard]] captured the Spanish flag after killing the [[standard bearer]].<ref name="Camogli, p. 76">Camogli and Privitellio, p. 76</ref>

===Cabral's intervention===
[[File:Cabral, soldado heroico.jpg|thumb|[[Jos<U+00E9> de San Mart<U+00ED>n]], trapped under his dead horse during the battle, is saved by [[Juan Bautista Cabral]].]]
Despite the victory, the remaining royalist forces could not be pursued as the column led by Justo Berm<U+00FA>dez had moved further than calculated for. This delayed the meeting with San Mart<U+00ED>n's column whose horse was killed by enemy fire, leaving with his leg trapped under the corpse of the animal. These factors led to the columns not meeting up and allowed many royalists to escape. A royalist, probably Zabala himself,<ref name="Galasso, p. 92"/><ref name="Camogli, p. 76"/> attempted to kill San Mart<U+00ED>n while he was trapped under his dead horse where he suffered a saber injury to his face, and a bullet wound to his arm. [[Juan Bautista Cabral]] and [[Juan Bautista Baigorria]] intervened and saved San Mart<U+00ED>n's life. Cabral was mortally wounded during the rescue and San Mart<U+00ED>n reported that after Cabral was hit he said "I die happy, we have defeated the enemy". The exact moment this was said is unclear as the word "after" could have meant immediately after; during the ongoing battle; or some hours later during Cabral's agonising decline.<ref>Galasso, p. 96</ref> San Mart<U+00ED>n wrote the battle report under a nearby tree. Fray Herminio Gait<U+00E1>n considers that Cabral's last words would have been in the [[Guaran<U+00ED> language]], his [[first language]], and that as San Mart<U+00ED>n also spoke Guaran<U+00ED> he would have translated them for the battle report.<ref>Galasso, p. 97</ref>

Juan Bautista Cabral is commonly known as "Sergeant Cabral", but he was a [[Private (rank)|private]] at the time of the battle. San Mart<U+00ED>n's report mentions him as "the grenadier Juan B. Cabral", and historians like [[Bartolom<U+00E9> Mitre]], [[Herminio Gait<U+00E1>n]], [[Gerardo Bra]] or [[Norberto Galasso]] support the idea. Mitre considers that Cabral was promoted [[posthumous recognition|posthumous]]ly, but there are no documents confirming that.<ref>Galasso, p. 97-98</ref>

==Aftermath==
Even though the battle of San Lorenzo is acknowledged in Argentine historiography as an important battle for Argentine independence, it had little military influence in the conflict. Much of the recognition the battle generated is because San Mart<U+00ED>n fought in it, as the size of the forces involved and the length of the clash would normally mean it was considered a [[Engagement (military)|military engagement]] rather than a real [[battle]] and it did not influence the development of the [[Argentine War of Independence]].<ref name="nueve tres">Galasso, p. 93</ref> This victory did nothing to prevent further raids from royalist ships as there were new raids at Tigre on August 18, 1813 and yet another one at San Fernando on August 22.<ref name="nueve tres"/> [[William Brown (admiral)|William Brown]] ended the royalist naval supremacy the following year.<ref name="Camogli, p. 76"/>

San Mart<U+00ED>n did not take hostages or ask for ransoms, but rather he instructed his people to avoid further conflicts and to try to restore peaceful relations with the royalists.<ref name="nueve cinco">Galasso, p. 95</ref> Zabala requested assistance for his wounded soldiers, which San Mart<U+00ED>n provided and he invited Zabala to share a large breakfast, which he accepted. San Mart<U+00ED>n was aware that the [[Age of Enlightenment|new enlightened ideas]] at stake in the [[Napoleonic Wars]] influenced many of the Spanish military, and expected to convince Zabala that absolutism was a bad cause to defend. He succeeded, as Zabala joined the patriot forces under San Mart<U+00ED>n's command during his administration in Mendoza.<ref name="nueve cinco"/>

[[Jos<U+00E9> Gervasio Artigas]], leader of the popular resistance at the [[Banda Oriental]], sent an agent to San Lorenzo to congratulate San Mart<U+00ED>n for his victory.<ref name="nueve ocho">Galasso, p. 98</ref> San Mart<U+00ED>n also met with John Parish Robertson, who informed Britain about the battle.<ref name="nueve ocho"/>

==Legacy==
[[File:EIDLN a San Martin.JPG|thumb|Plaque about the battle, at the [[San Carlos Convent]].]]
There are many Argentine memorials and places named after the battle, including four cities in [[Greater Rosario]]: [[Puerto General San Mart<U+00ED>n]], [[Fray Luis Beltr<U+00E1>n]], [[Capit<U+00E1>n Berm<U+00FA>dez]] and [[Granadero Baigorria]] are named after [[Jos<U+00E9> de San Mart<U+00ED>n]], [[Luis Beltr<U+00E1>n]], [[Justo Germ<U+00E1>n Berm<U+00FA>dez]] and [[Juan Bautista Baigorria]] respectively, all of whom were involved in the battle. The [[Sargento Cabral Department]] at the [[Chaco Province]] is named after [[Juan Bautista Cabral]], even though he was not a sergeant as described. The most popular homage to the battle is the name of the football club [[San Lorenzo de Almagro]], named after both the battle and [[Saint Lawrence]].<ref>[http://www.sanlorenzowebsite.com.ar/historia-del-club San Lorenzo web site <U+2013> Historia del club] {{es}}</ref>

The city of [[San Lorenzo, Santa Fe|San Lorenzo]] preserves the site of the battle and a dedicated historic complex. The [[San Carlos Convent]] is still a working convent, but has turned part of its buildings into a museum. It has retained San Mart<U+00ED>n's cell, the room used for medical treatment of the injured soldiers, urns of the dead soldiers and other related items to the "March of San Lorenzo" as well as the history of the convent. Raimundo, mayor of San Lorenzo, made an agreement with the Argentine Armed Forces in 2008 that the [[Regiment of Mounted Grenadiers (Argentina)|Regiment of Mounted Grenadiers]] would have a permanent presence at the site.<ref>[http://www.rgcgsm.ejercito.mil.ar/Dest_San_Lorenzo_Funciones.html Regimiento de Granaderos a Caballo <U+2013> Funciones] {{es}}</ref> 

The [[#Battlefield|battlefield]] is known as the "Field of Glory", and it was turned into a park on May 20, 1913, by president [[Roque S<U+00E1>enz Pe<U+00F1>a]]. There is a monument with two symbolic wings of victory, an [[eternal flame]] and nine memorials for the sixteen patriot soldiers who died in the battle. The memorials are for the nine origins of those soldiers: the Argentine provinces of Corrientes, Santiago del Estero, La Rioja, C<U+00F3>rdoba, San Luis and Buenos Aires, as well as Chile, France and Uruguay.<ref>[http://www.rgcgsm.ejercito.mil.ar/Dest_San_Lorenzo.html Campo de la Gloria] {{es}}</ref> Although Uruguay did not exist at the time of the battle, the [[Banda Oriental]] province is considered a predecessor of modern Uruguay. 

The pine tree ([[Pinus pinea]]) where San Martin wrote the battle report is known as the "Historic Pine", and has an estimated age of more than two hundred years. The convent, the battlefield and the Historic Pine were declared [[List of National Historic Monuments of Argentina|National Historic Monuments of Argentina]] on October 2, 1940 by law 12.648.<ref>[http://www3.hcdn.gov.ar/folio-cgi-bin/om_isapi.dll?clientID=181029&advquery=1153-D-00&headingswithhits=on&infobase=tp.nfo&record={90B9}&recordswithhits=on&softpage=Document42 Ley 1153-D-00] {{es}}</ref> The Historic Pine was declared a "Historic Tree" in 1946 by decree 3.038.<ref>[http://www.rgcgsm.ejercito.mil.ar/Dest_San_Lorenzo_Pino_Hist.html Pino hist<U+00F3>rico] {{es}}</ref>

{{see|San Lorenzo march}}
The battle of San Lorenzo is the theme of the [[San Lorenzo march]]. The military march was composed in February 1901 by [[Cayetano Alberto Silva]] following a proposal from Representative Celestino Pera. It was first officially played on October 30, 1902 at the inauguration of the monument to General San Mart<U+00ED>n in [[Rosario, Santa Fe|Rosario]]. The lyrics were written by professor Carlos Benielli in 1908.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.sanmartiniano.gov.ar/textos/parte2/texto042.php |title= La marcha de San Lorenzo|author= David Marchini and Diego Mayochi|date= |work= El combate de San Lorenzo|publisher= [[San Mart<U+00ED>n National Institute]]|language= Spanish|trans_title=The battle of San Lorenzo|accessdate=February 16, 2011}}</ref> The march became famous in other countries and, according to the [[Argentine British Community Council]], it has been considered in Europe to be one of the five best military marches ever written.<ref name="ABCC">{{cite web |url= http://www.abcc.org.ar/la-marcha-de-san-lorenzo|title= La Marcha de San Lorenzo or St. Lawrence<U+2019>s March|author= Dr. John Emery and Ian Gall|work= |publisher= Argentine British Community Council|accessdate=February 16, 2011}}</ref> The military bands of Uruguay, Brazil and Poland, amongst others, include it in their musical repertory.<ref name="ABCC"/> 

The battle of San Lorenzo was also mentioned as an Argentine victory in the first [[Argentine National Anthem]], along with the battles of San Jos<U+00E9>, Suipacha, Las Piedras, Salta and Tucum<U+00E1>n.<ref>"San Jos<U+00E9>, San Lorenzo, Suipacha, both Piedras, Salta and Tucum<U+00E1>n; La Colonia and the same walls of the tyrant in the Banda Oriental. They are eternal signboards that say: 'Here the Argentine arm found triumph, here the fierce oppressor of the Fatherland his proud neck bent'." <U+2013> [[Argentine National Anthem]]</ref> There is also a brief reference to the battle in the march ''Mi bandera'' ("My flag"), which is about the [[flag of Argentina]]. However, this march includes a historic inaccuracy. It says "Here is the flag that one day triumphantly rose in the middle of the battle and, full of pride and gallantry, went immortally to San Lorenzo". This is incorrect as the current flag of Argentina was not widely used until 1814 or 1815. The [[Battle of Salta]] was the only conflict of the Argentine War of Independence fought in current Argentine territory under the modern flag of Argentina.<ref name="nueve cuatro">Galasso, p. 94</ref> The [[San Mart<U+00ED>n National Institute]] states, by [[oral tradition]], that the grenadiers of San Lorenzo did not use any flag for the operation.<ref name="nueve cinco"/>
