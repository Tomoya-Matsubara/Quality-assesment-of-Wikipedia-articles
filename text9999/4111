'''Dennis Wayne Johnson''' (September 18, 1954 <U+2013> February 22, 2007), nicknamed "'''DJ'''", was an American professional [[basketball]] player for the [[National Basketball Association]]'s (NBA) [[Seattle SuperSonics]], [[Phoenix Suns]] and [[Boston Celtics]] and coach of the [[Los Angeles Clippers]]. He was an alumnus of [[Dominguez High School]], [[Los Angeles Harbor College]] and [[Pepperdine University]].<ref name=nbabio>{{cite web| url=http://www.nba.com/history/players/djohnson_bio.html|title=Dennis Johnson Bio|publisher=Turner Sports Interactive, Inc|work=NBA.com|accessdate=August 17, 2007}}</ref>

A prototypical late bloomer, Johnson overcame early struggles<ref name=cn>{{cite web|url=http://www.celtic-nation.com/interviews/dennis_johnson/dennis_johnson_page1.htm|title=The Long Shot: The Dennis Johnson Interview|work=Celtic-nation.com|first=Michael D.|last=McClellan|date=October 1, 2002|accessdate=August 17, 2007}}</ref> and had a successful NBA playing career. Drafted 29th overall in 1976 by the [[Seattle SuperSonics]], Johnson began his professional career as a [[shooting guard]]. He eventually led the Sonics to their only NBA championship in [[1979 NBA Finals|1979]], winning the [[Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award|NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award (MVP)]]. After a short stint with the [[Phoenix Suns]], he became the starting [[point guard]] for the [[Boston Celtics]], with whom he won two more championships. Johnson was voted into five All-Star Teams, one [[All-NBA Team|All-NBA]] First and one Second Team, and nine consecutive [[NBA All-Defensive Team|All-Defensive First and Second Teams]].<ref name=stats>{{cite web|url=http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/johnsde01.html|title=Dennis Johnson Stats|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|work=basketball-reference.com|accessdate=August 17, 2007}}</ref> Apart from his reputation as a defensive stopper, Johnson was known as a clutch player who made several decisive plays in NBA playoffs history.<ref name=nbabio/>

The Celtics franchise has retired Johnson's number 3 jersey, which hangs from the rafters of the [[TD Garden]], the home arena of the team. On April 5, 2010, the Naismith Memorial [[Basketball Hall of Fame]] officially announced that Johnson had been posthumously elected to the Hall and would be formally inducted on August 13.<ref name="HOF release">{{cite press release|url=http://www.hoophall.com/news/2010/4/5/naismith-memorial-basketball-hall-of-fame-announces-class-of.html |title=Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame Announces Class of 2010 |publisher=Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame |date=2010-04-05 |accessdate=2010-04-05}}</ref> He is considered by several sports journalists to be one of the most underrated players of all time.<ref name=simmons/><ref name=shouler1>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/columns/story?id=2394981|title=Hall of Fame still neglecting a few greats|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=February 3, 2008}}</ref><ref name=shouler2>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/columns/story?columnist=shouler_ken&id=2822048|title=Shining stars who belong in the Hall of Fame|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=February 3, 2008}}</ref>

==Early years==
Dennis Wayne Johnson was born the eighth of sixteen children, to a social worker and a bricklayer who lived in [[Compton, California|Compton]] in Los Angeles, California.<ref name=nbabio/> Originally a baseball fan and a [[Little League Baseball|Little League]]r,<ref name=cn/> Johnson learned basketball from his father, but seemed to have neither the size nor the talent to compete with his peers: as a teenager at [[Dominguez High School]], Johnson measured just 5'9" and played only "a minute or two each game".<ref name=nbabio/> After high school, he worked several odd jobs, including a $2.75-per-hour job as a forklift driver, and played with his brothers in summer league games after work. During this period, Johnson grew to a height of 6'3",<ref name=cn/> and developed what nba.com later described as "rocket launcher legs", which enabled him to jump high to grab [[rebound (basketball)|rebounds]] against taller opponents.<ref name=nbabio/>

Jim White, the coach at [[Los Angeles Harbor College]], had watched Johnson play [[Streetball|street basketball]]; feeling that Johnson excelled in defense, White asked him to enroll.<ref name=cn/> Johnson gave up his jobs and developed into a promising young guard, averaging 18.3 points and 12.0 rebounds per game and leading Harbor to a college junior state title.<ref name=nbabio/> However, the young guard lacked discipline, often clashed with White and was thrown out of the team three times in two years.<ref name=cn/>

At the end of his junior college career, two universities offered Johnson scholarships: [[Azusa Pacific University]] and [[Pepperdine University]].<ref name=nbabio/> Johnson chose the latter, and in his only year in college, he averaged 15.7 points, 5.8 rebounds and 3.3 assists per game,<ref name=stats/> and developed a reputation for tough defense. After that year, Johnson made himself eligible for the [[1976 NBA Draft]], but was skeptical that any team would take him.<ref name=nbabio/> NBA teams were wary of drafting a player with character issues,<ref name=cn/> and Johnson was known to be a troublemaker.

==Professional career==
===Seattle SuperSonics (1976<U+2013>80)===
The [[Seattle SuperSonics]] took Johnson in the second round of the 1976 draft with the 29th pick and gave him a four-year contract, with which he earned a salary of $45,000 in the first year and $90,000 in the last.<ref name=shouler>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/columns/story?id=2776021|title=Shouler: DJ deserving of praise|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=August 17, 2007}}</ref> In his rookie year, the [[1976<U+2013>77 NBA season]], Johnson, playing backup to the experienced Sonics backcourt tandem of [[Slick Watts]] and [[Fred Brown (basketball)|Fred Brown]], averaged 9.2&nbsp;points and 1.5&nbsp;assists per game.<ref name=stats/> The Sonics finished with a 40<U+2013>42 record<ref name=sonicsstats>{{cite web|url=http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/SEA/|title=Seattle Supersonics Team Indexs|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|work=basketball-reference.com|accessdate=August 17, 2007}}</ref> and missed the [[1977 NBA Playoffs]], leading head coach [[Bill Russell]] to resign.<ref name=nbabio/> In the following [[1977<U+2013>78 NBA season|season]], the team lost 17 of the first 22&nbsp;games under Russell's replacement [[Bob Hopkins]], who was replaced by Hall of Fame coach [[Lenny Wilkens]], who gave Johnson a starting spot and paired him with [[Gus Williams]].<ref name=nbabio/> Johnson revelled in this new role, improving his averages to 12.7&nbsp;points and 2.8&nbsp;assists per game.<ref name=stats/> During this period Johnson played [[shooting guard]] and was known for his aggressive [[slam dunk]]ing, in contrast to the more cerebral roles he played later in his career.<ref name=simmons/> It was at this time that Johnson's nickname "DJ" was coined by play-by-play announcer [[Bob Blackburn (announcer)|Bob Blackburn]], to help distinguish him from teammates [[John Johnson (basketball)|John Johnson]] and [[Vinnie Johnson]] (whom Blackburn referred to as "JJ" and "VJ" respectively).<ref name=dj>{{cite news|title=D.J. had yen for big shots, big-time 'D'|page=C.1|work=The News Tribune|first=Bill|last=Schey|accessdate=February 3, 2008}}</ref>

Finishing strongly, the Sonics ended the regular season with a 47<U+2013>35 record and made the [[1978 NBA Playoffs]]. After eliminating the [[Los Angeles Lakers]], the defending champion [[Portland Trail Blazers]] and the [[Denver Nuggets]], they almost defeated the [[Washington Bullets]] by taking a 3<U+2013>2 lead in the [[1978 NBA Finals]]. In a 93<U+2013>92 Game 3 victory, Johnson blocked seven shots<U+2014>the most blocks in NBA Finals history for a guard.<ref name=finalsrecords>{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/nba/01playoffs/finals/records.htm|title=NBA Finals records|work=USA Today|accessdate=February 3, 2008 | date=June 2, 2001}}</ref><ref name=finals78>{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/history/this_date_may.html|title=This Date in History-May|publisher=Turner Sports Interactive, Inc|work=NBA.com|accessdate=September 26, 2009}}</ref> However, the Sonics lost in seven games, partly because of Johnson's Game 7 scoring drought, in which the second-year guard missed all of his 14 field goal attempts.<ref name= shouler/> Johnson later acknowledged that he simply "choked"; he vowed never to repeat this again and credited this game as an important lesson to become a better player.<ref name=cn/>

Johnson and the Sonics got their revenge in the [[1978<U+2013>79 NBA season|1978<U+2013>79 season]]. After clinching the Pacific Division with a 52<U+2013>30 record,<ref name=sonicsstats/> the team met the Bullets again in the [[1979 NBA Finals]]. After losing Game 1, the Sonics won the next four games to take the finals series, helped by Johnson, who averaged almost 23&nbsp;points along with six rebounds and assists per game.<ref name=finals79>{{cite web|url=http://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/NBA_1979_finals.html|title=1979 NBA Finals Composite Box Score|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|work=basketball-reference.com|accessdate=September 26, 2009}}</ref> He scored 32&nbsp;points in a Game 4 overtime victory, and was named [[NBA Finals MVP]].<ref name=nbabio/> It was during this season that Johnson established himself as one of the best guards in the league; he averaged 15.9&nbsp;points and 3.5&nbsp;assists per game, and made his first All-Defensive First Team and All-Star Game appearance.<ref name=stats/>

During the [[1979<U+2013>80 NBA season|following season]], Johnson averaged 19.0&nbsp;points and 4.1&nbsp;assists, appeared in his second All-Star Game and was named to the All-Defensive First Team and All-NBA Second Team.<ref name=stats/> However, the Sonics lost in the [[1980 NBA Playoffs|Western Conference Finals]] against the Lakers, who had Hall of Famers [[Magic Johnson]] and [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]]. Because of the abundance of talent on the losing Sonics team, Johnson later called this loss one of the worst disappointments of his professional career.<ref name=cn/> Coach Wilkens grew tired of Johnson, who often clashed with him and was perceived as a growing liability for the team.<ref name=cn/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1367&dat=19801002&id=F-IVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=QxMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=4554,409468|title=Wilkens labels Johnson 'cancer'|work=[[The Star-News|Wilmington Morning Star]]|date=October 2, 1980|accessdate=September 26, 2009}}</ref> At the end of the season, Johnson was traded to the [[Phoenix Suns]] for [[Paul Westphal]] and draft picks. The Sonics finished 22&nbsp;games worse in the next season despite the addition of Westphal.<ref name=simmons/>

===Phoenix Suns (1980<U+2013>83)===
In Phoenix, Johnson further established himself as a quality player. In his three years as a Sun, Johnson averaged 14<U+2013>20 points a game and provided tough defense. He played in two All-Star Games, was voted into three consecutive All-Defensive First Teams and earned his only All-NBA First Team appearance.<ref name=stats/> In this period, Johnson played shooting guard and became the main scorer on the team, as opposed to being the second or third option as a Sonic.<ref name=simmons/>

In the first two years of Johnson's stint, the Suns were fairly successful, reaching the Western Conference Semifinals both seasons. The Suns bowed out in the first round in Johnson's last year.<ref name=sunsstats>{{cite web|url=http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/PHO/|title=Phoenix Suns Team Indexs|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|work=basketball-reference.com|accessdate=August 17, 2007}}</ref> Towards the end of his career at Phoenix, Johnson's deteriorating situation in Phoenix. Like in Seattle, he often clashed with his coach, [[John MacLeod (basketball)|John MacLeod]], and was finally traded by general manager [[Jerry Colangelo]] to the Boston Celtics for [[Rick Robey]] and draft picks.<ref name=cn/> Like Seattle after Johnson's departure, the Suns finished 12 games worse in the next season despite the addition of Robey.<ref name=simmons/>

===Boston Celtics (1983<U+2013>90)===
Before the [[1983<U+2013>84 NBA season|1983<U+2013>84 season]], the Celtics had repeatedly lost to the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] in the NBA Playoffs, mainly because physical Sixers guard [[Andrew Toney]] routinely caused problems for their defensively fragile backcourt. Thus, Celtics general manager [[Red Auerbach]] added the perennial All-Defensive Team member Johnson to his squad.<ref name=simmons/> Johnson joined a squad led by Hall of Fame forward [[Larry Bird]], who played in the frontcourt with two fellow Hall of Famers, center [[Robert Parish]] and forward [[Kevin McHale]], a combination often called the best frontcourt of all time by the NBA.<ref name=birdbio>{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/history/players/bird_bio.html|title=Larry Bird Bio|publisher=Turner Sports Interactive, Inc|work=NBA.com|accessdate=August 17, 2007}}</ref> Johnson described joining the Celtics as a "dream come true" and enjoyed the tutelage of highly successful general manager Auerbach, who was "living history" according to Johnson.<ref name=cn/>

With the Celtics, Johnson changed his playing style for the third time in his career: after being known as a [[slam dunk]]ing shooting guard with the Sonics, and an all-around scorer with the Suns, he now established himself as a [[point guard]] who was defined more by playmaking than scoring.<ref name=simmons/> In his first year as a Celtic, he averaged 13.2&nbsp;points and 4.2&nbsp;assists and was elected to the All-Defensive Second Team.<ref name=stats/> The Celtics reached the [[1984 NBA Finals]], where they met the [[Los Angeles Lakers]], their intense [[Lakers<U+2013>Celtics rivalry|rivals since the 1960s]]. The Celtics won 4<U+2013>3, and Johnson took credit for playing smothering defense on Hall of Fame Lakers playmaker Magic Johnson, limiting him to a sub-average 17 points in the last four games,<ref name=simmons/> and being at least partly responsible for several of the Laker point guard's game-deciding errors in Games 2, 4 and 7. As a result, Magic Johnson was taunted as "Tragic Johnson" whenever the Lakers and Celtics played against each other.<ref name=magicbio>{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/history/players/johnsonm_bio.html|title=Magic Johnson Bio|publisher=Turner Sports Interactive, Inc|work=NBA.com|accessdate=August 17, 2007}}</ref>

In the [[1984<U+2013>85 NBA season|1984<U+2013>85 season]], Johnson continued playing smothering defense, earning his next All-Defensive Second Team call-up while averaging 16.9&nbsp;points and 7.3&nbsp;assists per game.<ref name=stats/> The Celtics met the Lakers in the [[1985 NBA Finals]] again. Johnson's big moment came in Game 4: when the score was tied 105<U+2013>105, teammate [[Larry Bird]] had the ball in the last seconds. Being double-teamed by Lakers [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]] and Magic Johnson, Bird passed to the open Johnson, and the guard sank a {{convert|19|ft|m|sing=on}} [[buzzer beater]] to win the game.<ref name=shouler/> However, the Lakers took their revenge this time, winning the series in six games, powered by venerable 38-year-old Finals MVP Abdul-Jabbar. Johnson described this loss as one of the toughest in his career, because the Celtics were "close [to winning the series]" but "could not get the job done".<ref name=cn/>

In the [[1985<U+2013>86 NBA season|following season]], the Celtics made the playoffs, helped by the performance of Johnson, who made the All-Defensive Second Team again while scoring 17.8&nbsp;points and 6.7&nbsp;assists per game.<ref name=stats/> After defeating the [[Milwaukee Bucks]] in the Eastern Conference Finals, the Celtics reached the [[1986 NBA Finals]] against the up-and-coming [[Houston Rockets]], led by the "Twin Towers" of centers [[Ralph Sampson]] and [[Hakeem Olajuwon]]. Led by Finals MVP Larry Bird, the Celtics beat the Rockets 4<U+2013>2, and Johnson won his third title.<ref name=celticsstats>{{cite web|url=http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/BOS/|title=Boston Celtics Team Indexs|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|work=basketball-reference.com|accessdate=August 17, 2007}}</ref>

The Celtics were unable to repeat their title in [[1986<U+2013>87 NBA season|1987]] despite several dramatic playoff victories. Johnson played strong defense again, earning yet another appearance on the All-Defensive Second Team,<ref name=stats/> and the Celtics embarked on a nail-biting playoff campaign. In the [[1987 NBA Playoffs|1987 Eastern Conference Semifinals]], the Celtics split the first six games against the [[Milwaukee Bucks]] 3<U+2013>3. In the deciding Game 7, which the Celtics won, Johnson had a spectacular play with 1:30 left in the game: a Celtics ball threatened to fly out of bounds, but Johnson dived for it and whipped it backwards in mid-air against Bucks center [[Jack Sikma]]. The ball bounced off Sikma before going out of bounds, and the Celtics maintained possession.<ref name=simmons/>

In the next round, the [[1987 NBA Playoffs|1987 Eastern Conference Finals]], the Celtics faced the [[Detroit Pistons]]. The series was described as a grudge match between two intense rivals, featuring a great level of personal animosity, [[trash talk|sharp rhetoric]] and several physical altercations. The center of this feud was Pistons pivot [[Bill Laimbeer]], who brawled with Celtics players Bird and Parish.<ref name=laimbeerbio>{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/history/players/laimbeer_bio.html|title=Bill Laimbeer Bio|publisher=Turner Sports Interactive, Inc|work=NBA.com|accessdate=August 17, 2007}}</ref> In Game 5, Johnson was involved in a crucial play: down by one point, [[Larry Bird]] stole an inbound pass by Pistons point guard [[Isiah Thomas]] with six seconds left and passed it to a sprinting Johnson, who converted a difficult layup as time expired.<ref name=nbabio/> This play caused Celtics broadcaster [[Johnny Most]] to shout out one of his most famous quotes:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/aroundtheassociation/ataregularseasonreview_auerbachjohnson_070405.html|title=The Tale of Two Legends|first=Josh|last=Cohen|publisher=Turner Sports Interactive, Inc|work=NBA.com|accessdate=September 26, 2009}}</ref>
{{cquote|Now there's a steal by Bird! Underneath to DJ who lays it in!!...Right at one second left! What a play by Bird!! Bird stole the inbounding pass, laid it up to DJ, and DJ laid it up and in, and Boston has a one-point lead with one second left! Oh, my, this place is going crazy!!!}}
According to Johnson, this was his favorite play of all-time.<ref name=cn/> Game 6 and Game 7 also featured a feud, this time between Pistons forward [[Dennis Rodman]] and Johnson. In Game 6, which the Pistons won, Rodman taunted Johnson in the closing seconds by waving his right hand over his head. When the Celtics took Game 7, Johnson went back at Rodman in the last moments of the game and mimicked his taunting gesture.<ref name=simmons/> In the [[1987 NBA Finals]], however, the Celtics succumbed to the Los Angeles Lakers 4<U+2013>2 as Lakers playmaker and Finals MVP Magic Johnson put up a great performance, averaging 26&nbsp;points and 13&nbsp;assists throughout the series.<ref name=magicbio/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/NBA_1987_finals.html|title=1987 NBA Finals Composite Box Score|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|work=basketball-reference.com|accessdate=October 9, 2009}}</ref>

The next three seasons were disappointing for the aging Celtics. In the [[1987<U+2013>88 NBA season|1987<U+2013>88 season]], Johnson averaged 12.6&nbsp;points and 7.8&nbsp;assists,<ref name=stats/> but in the [[1988 NBA Playoffs|1988 Playoffs]], the Celtics were unable to beat the [[Detroit Pistons]] in the Eastern Conference Finals.<ref name=celticsstats/> In the [[1988<U+2013>89 NBA season|next season]], Johnson (who statistically declined to 10.0&nbsp;points and 6.6&nbsp;assists per game)<ref name=stats/> and his team made the [[1989 NBA Playoffs]] on a meager 42<U+2013>40 record, but was immediately eliminated in the first round.<ref name=celticsstats/> The following [[1989<U+2013>90 NBA season]] was Johnson's last. The now 35-year-old playmaker relinquished his starting point guard role to younger [[John Bagley (basketball)|John Bagley]], but when Bagley dislocated his shoulder, Johnson returned with high level of performance and was lovingly called "our glue man" by coach [[Jimmy Rodgers (basketball)|Jimmy Rodgers]].<ref name=defwiz/><ref>{{cite news |title=DJ Quietly Impressing His Point|work=The Boston Globe|first=Joe|last=Burris|accessdate=October 23, 2009|date=January 5, 1990|page=44}}</ref> In that season, Johnson started in 65 of his 75 games, averaging 7.1&nbsp;points and 6.5&nbsp;assists,<ref name=stats/> but the Celtics failed to survive the first round of the [[1990 NBA Playoffs]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/BOS/1990.html|title=1989-90 Boston Celtics Roster and Statistics|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|work=basketball-reference.com|accessdate=October 23, 2009}}</ref>

Johnson retired after the Celtics did not offer him a new contract at the beginning of the [[1990<U+2013>91 NBA season|1990<U+2013>91 season]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/02/sports/sports-people-pro-basketball-johnson-not-offered-contract-by-celtics.html|title=Sports People: Pro Basketball; Johnson Not Offered Contract by Celtics|work=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|first=|last=|date=October 2, 1990|accessdate=October 1, 2009}}</ref> During his retirement ceremony, his perennial Los Angeles Lakers opponent Magic Johnson telegraphed him and lauded him as "the best backcourt defender of all time".<ref name=defwiz>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/23/sports/basketball/23johnson.html|title=Dennis Johnson, 52, N.B.A. Defensive Wizard, Dies|work=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|first=Richard|last=Goldstein|date=February 23, 2007|accessdate=February 23, 2007}}</ref> In addition, Celtics colleague and triple [[NBA Most Valuable Player]] award winner [[Larry Bird]] called Johnson the best teammate he ever had.<ref name=nbabio/>

===Post-player career===
After retiring as a player, Johnson worked as a scout for the Celtics.<ref name=nbabio/> In 1993, he became an assistant coach for the Celtics, a position he held until 1997.<ref name=defwiz/> After spending several years outside the limelight, he returned as an assistant coach for the [[Los Angeles Clippers]] in 2000, and spent four seasons there. For 24&nbsp;games toward the end of the [[2002<U+2013>03 NBA season|2002<U+2013>03 season]], Johnson served as interim head coach after the departure of [[Alvin Gentry]].<ref name=defwiz/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/percyallen/2003585213_soni23.html|title=D.J. left indelible mark|work=[[The Seattle Times]]|date=February 23, 2007|first=Percy|last=Allen|accessdate=September 27, 2009}}</ref> Johnson later worked as a scout for the [[Portland Trail Blazers]], and in 2004, he was named head coach of the [[NBA Development League]]'s [[Florida Flame]]. A year later, he became head coach of the NBADL's [[Austin Toros]], and held that position until his death two years later.<ref name=defwiz/>

==Legacy==
[[Image:Celtics3.png|left|95px|thumbnail|alt=A "3" inside a square, written in green|In 1991, the Boston Celtics retired a number-3 jersey with Dennis Johnson's name.]]
In 1,100&nbsp;games, Johnson scored 15,535&nbsp;points, grabbed 4,249&nbsp;rebounds and gave 5,499&nbsp;assists, translating to career averages of 14.1&nbsp;points, 3.9&nbsp;rebounds and 5.0&nbsp;assists per game.<ref name=stats/> Known as a defensive stalwart, he was elected into nine straight All-Defensive First or Second Teams.<ref name=stats/> Johnson is also acknowledged by the NBA as a "money player"<ref name=nbabio/> who was clutch in decisive moments, such as scoring 32&nbsp;points for his team in a Game 4 overtime victory in the 1979 NBA Finals, playing smothering defense on Magic Johnson in the [[1984 NBA Finals]], and converting a last-second layup in Game 5 of the 1987 Eastern Conference Finals after a [[Larry Bird]] steal.<ref name=nbabio/>

Furthermore, Johnson is lauded by the NBA as a versatile all-around weapon who played with "contagious competitiveness"<ref name=nbabio/> and was known for his durability: in 14 NBA seasons, he played in 1,100 of a possible 1,148&nbsp;games and participated in 180 playoff games, the latter figure the 11th highest number of all time.<ref name=simmons>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=simmons/070222|title=The Sports Guy: RIP, DJ|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=August 17, 2007}}</ref> At his retirement, Johnson was only the 11th NBA player to amass more than 15,000&nbsp;points and 5,000&nbsp;assists.<ref name=nbabio/>

On December 13, 1991, the Celtics franchise retired his number 3 jersey. Johnson said he would always be a Boston Celtic, and remarked that seeing his number in the rafters gave him a "special feeling".<ref name=cn/> However, Johnson did not live to see an induction into the [[Basketball Hall of Fame]], a fact that has been a considerable point of debate with sports journalists. [[Bill Simmons]] of [[ESPN]] called his Hall of Fame snub an "ongoing injustice", stating that according to him, [[Joe Dumars]] <U+2013> a Hall of Famer known for strong defense rather than spectacular scoring, like Johnson <U+2013> was no better [a basketball player] than him.<ref name=simmons/> Colleague Ken Shouler called Johnson "one of the first guys I'd give a Hall [of Fame] pass".<ref name=shouler/> Contemporary Boston Celtics Hall of Fame forward [[Larry Bird]] gave Johnson ultimate praise, calling him the best teammate he ever had in his biography ''Drive''.<ref name=nbabio/>, which is especially significant considering Bird's teammates included Hall of Famers [[Kevin McHale]], [[Robert Parish]], [[Bill Walton]], and [[Tiny Archibald]].<ref>basketball-reference.com</ref>.  On April 3, 2010, [[ESPN]] Boston reported that Johnson was posthumously elected to the Basketball Hall of Fame.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/boston/nba/news/story?id=5052939|title=Source: Johnson makes HOF|date=April 3, 2010|publisher=ESPN Boston|accessdate=April 4, 2010}}</ref> This was officially confirmed two days later when the Hall released the list of 2010 inductees.<ref name="HOF release"/>

On October 26, 2007, a learning center was dedicated in Johnson's name in the Central Branch of the YMCA of Greater Boston. The center was made possible by the donations and effort of Larry Bird and M.L. Carr. Johnson's family, Danny Ainge, Carr, and members of the YMCA and local community were present for the ribbon cutting ceremony. Donna Johnson said on behalf of her husband, "If Dennis were alive he would really appreciate the thought and love the idea of the Learning Center."<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.nba.com/celtics/community/press102607-bird-carr-warm2kids-dj.html|title=Larry Bird & M.L.

===Death===
On February 22, 2007, at the [[Austin Convention Center]], Johnson had a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] and collapsed at the end of the Toros' practice.<ref name=defwiz/> After being rushed to a nearby hospital, he could not be revived and was later pronounced dead. Johnson was survived by his wife and his children.<ref name=defwiz/> Johnson's death was met with shock throughout the NBA. Among others, contemporary Celtics colleague [[Danny Ainge]] called him one of "the most underrated players of all time [...] and one of the greatest Celtics acquisitions",<ref name=defwiz/> and one-time rival [[Bill Laimbeer]] called him "a great player on a great ballclub".<ref name=defwiz/>
