"'''Come On Eileen'''" is a song by English pop group [[Dexys Midnight Runners]], released in the UK on 25 June 1982<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=[[NME]] |publisher=[[IPC Media]] |location=London, England |page=34 |date=19 June 1982}}</ref> as a single off their album ''[[Too-Rye-Ay]]''. It was their second number 1 hit in the [[United Kingdom]], following 1980's "[[Geno (song)|Geno]]". The song was written by [[Kevin Rowland]], "Big" Jim Paterson, and Billy Adams; it was produced by [[Clive Langer]] and [[Alan Winstanley]].

"Come On Eileen" won Best British Single at the 1983 [[Brit Awards]].

==Composition==
There are various versions of the song, some in addition to the main section featuring either an intro of a Celtic fiddle solo, or an a cappella coda both based on [[Thomas Moore]]'s Irish folk song "[[Believe Me, if All Those Endearing Young Charms]]"
	
The main section begins with a [[Celtic music|Celtic]]-style fiddle played over a drum beat, with the bass guitar and piano providing accompaniment.

The lyrics of the song begin with the lines:

<blockquote>Poor old [[Johnnie Ray]]<br>
Sounded sad upon the radio<br>
Moved a million hearts in mono<br>
Our mothers cried, sang along<br>
Who would blame them?</blockquote>

The phrase "Come on Eileen" is used as the chorus to the song, which was loosely inspired by the song "A Man Like Me" by the 1960s British soul group [[Jimmy James (singer)|Jimmy James]] and the Vagabonds.<ref>{{cite video|title= Jimmy James - A Man Like Me |date= 12 June 2009 |publisher= [[YouTube]] |url= http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYsyov8ikcU&feature=player_detailpage#t=147s |accessdate= 26 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.dexys.co.uk/audio.htm Audio |title= www.dexys.co.uk |publisher= Dexys.co.uk}} {{dead link|date=January 2012}}</ref>

The [[Bridge (music)|bridge]] of "Come On Eileen" features an improvised [[counter-melody]] which begins in a slow tempo and gets faster and faster over an [[Tempo|accelerando]] vocal backing. The chord sequence of the bridge is actually the same as the verses, but transposed up by a [[whole tone]].  The bridge is based on the Irish folk melody "[[Too Ra Loo Ra Loo Ral]]". Throughout the song, there are numerous tempo changes and key changes:
