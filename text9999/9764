'''''Kahaani''''' ({{IPA-hns|k<U+0259><U+02C8><U+0266>a<U+02D0>ni|IPA}}; "Story") is a 2012 [[Bollywood|Indian]] [[thriller (genre)|thriller]] film directed and co-produced by [[Sujoy Ghosh]]. It stars [[Vidya Balan]] as Vidya Bagchi, a pregnant woman searching for her missing husband in [[Kolkata]] during the festival of [[Durga Puja]], assisted by Satyaki "Rana" Sinha ([[Parambrata Chatterjee]]) and Khan ([[Nawazuddin Siddiqui]]).

Shot in Kolkata, the crew often employed [[guerrilla filmmaking|guerrilla-filmmaking]] techniques on the city's streets to avoid attracting attention. The film was noted for its deft portrayal of the city and for making use of many local crew and cast members. ''Kahaani'' explores themes of feminism and motherhood in male-dominated Indian society. The film also makes several allusions to [[Satyajit Ray]]'s films such as ''[[Charulata]]'' (1964) and ''[[Aranyer Dinratri]]'' (1970).

''Kahaani'' was released worldwide on 9 March 2012. Critics praised the screenplay, the cinematography and the performances of the lead actors. Due to critical acclaim and word-of-mouth publicity, the film became a [[sleeper hit]], earning {{INRConvert|1.04|b}} worldwide in 50 days. At the end of its theatrical run the film won several awards, including three [[National Film Awards]] and five [[Filmfare Awards]]. The latter included trophies for [[Filmfare Award for Best Director|Best Director]] (Ghosh) and [[Filmfare Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] (Balan).

==Plot==
<!-- Per WP:FilmPlot, plot summaries for feature film articles should be between 400 and 700 words. Please do not expand it. Thanks -->
The film opens with a poison-gas attack on a [[Kolkata Metro|Kolkata Metro Rail]] compartment, killing the passengers on board. Two years later Vidya Bagchi ([[Vidya Balan]]), a pregnant [[software engineer]], arrives in [[Kolkata]] from London during the [[Durga Puja]] festivities in search of her missing husband, Arnab Bagchi. A police officer, Satyaki "Rana" Sinha ([[Parambrata Chatterjee]]), offers to help. Although Vidya claims that Arnab went to Kolkata on an assignment for the National Data Center (NDC), initial investigations suggest that no such person was employed by the NDC.

Agnes D'mello, the NDC's head of human resources, suggests to Vidya that her husband resembled former employee Milan Damji ([[Indraneil Sengupta]]), whose file is probably kept in the old NDC office. Before Agnes can provide any further help she is killed by Bob Biswas ([[Saswata Chatterjee]]), an assassin working undercover as a life insurance agent. Vidya and Rana break into the NDC office and find Damji's file, barely escaping an encounter with Bob, who is searching for the same information. Meanwhile, the attempts to obtain Damji's records have attracted the attention of two [[Intelligence Bureau (India)|Intelligence Bureau]] (IB) officials in Delhi&nbsp;<U+2013> the chief Bhaskaran K. ([[Dhritiman Chatterjee]]) and his deputy Khan ([[Nawazuddin Siddiqui]]). Khan arrives in Kolkata and reveals that Damji was a rogue IB agent responsible for the poison-gas attack. In spite of Khan's warnings, Vidya continues her search, fearing that Arnab's resemblance to Damji may have led him into trouble.

The address on Damji's record leads Vidya and Rana to a dilapidated flat. An errand boy from the neighbourhood tea stall identifies R. Sridhar, an NDC officer, as a frequent visitor to Damji's flat. Bob attempts to kill Vidya, but fails, and is run over by a [[Tempo (car)|Tempo]] during a chase. Examination of Bob's mobile phone leads Vidya and Rana to an [[IP address]] sending instructions to kill her. They break into Sridhar's office to verify his IP address, but he is alerted electronically and returns to his office. Vidya accidentally shoots Sridhar dead during a scuffle, which upsets Khan, who had wanted him alive.

Sridhar's computer data reveals a code, which when deciphered reveals Bhaskaran's phone number. Vidya calls Bhaskaran to tell him that she has retrieved sensitive documents from Sridhar's office. She asks Bhaskaran to help find her husband in exchange for the documents, but Bhaskaran tells her to contact the local police. Vidya soon gets a call from an unknown number however, warning her that she should hand over the documents to the caller if she wishes to see her husband alive. Khan thinks the caller is Milan Damji.

Vidya goes to meet Damji, followed by Rana and Khan. Damji cuts the meeting short when Vidya expresses her doubt that he will be able to return her husband in exchange for the sensitive file, and he attempts to leave. Vidya tries to stop him, and in the ensuing struggle Damji draws a gun on her. Vidya disarms him using the prosthetic belly she has been using to fake her pregnancy, before shooting him with his own gun. She flees into the crowd before the police arrive, leaving a thank-you note for Rana and a [[USB flash drive|pen drive]] containing data from Sridhar's computer, which leads to Bhaskaran's arrest. Rana concludes that no Vidya or Arnab Bagchi ever existed, and that Vidya had been using the police and the IB to achieve her own ends.

Vidya is revealed to be the widow of Arup Basu ([[Abir Chatterjee]]), an IB officer and Damji's colleague, who was killed in the poison-gas attack. In her mission to avenge his death, Vidya was helped by retired IB officer Pratap Bajpayee ([[Darshan Jariwala]]), who suspected the involvement of a top IB official.

Ghosh, who co-wrote the story and the screenplay, began to plan the film while awaiting the release of his previous film ''[[Aladin (2009 film)|Aladin]]'' (2009), but the dismal response to ''Aladin'' was a setback.

Ghosh went against the expectations of casting a popular actor from Bollywood. He signed Bengali actor Abir Chatterjee to play Balan's husband. According to Ghosh, popular Bollywood actors were not willing to work with him after his two previous flops.

Before the shooting of the film began, Balan started to use a prosthetic belly to look as close to authentically pregnant as possible.

While briefing Saswata Chatterjee about his character, the cold-blooded killer Bob Biswas, Ghosh used the phrase ''"Binito Bob"'' (meaning polite Bob), which crystallised the notion of Bob's manners. Further discussions led to the inclusion of paunch and a bald patch. Chatterjee devised the mannerism of rubbing his nails together as some Indians believe doing that helps prevent hair loss. The mannerism was well- noted and praised by the viewers.<ref name="toi 30march12chatterjee"/> Ghosh was surprised at how Bob Biswas was greeted by fans as a cult figure. He emphasised that the deliberate ordinariness of Bob Biswas was portrayed so convincingly by Chatterjee that the viewers can expect Bob to be around them at any time and any place.<ref name="Pop art on Saswata # TOI">{{cite news

Ghosh chose the guest house in which the protagonist stays after noticing it during his visit to a neighbouring hotel in April 2010. He booked it for 10 days for {{INRConvert|40|k}}, and requested the guest-house employees to keep the shooting schedule a secret. Choosing a room with windows overlooking a busy road, he proceeded to give it an old-fashioned look by replacing the windows' designer grilles with old-fashioned wooden ones, and by painting the room with some rough patches.<ref name="StarChamber" />

Ghosh acknowledges the allusions to Ray's films. In one scene, Vidya asks the manager of the guest house why there is no hot water although the signboard had claimed "running hot water". The manager explains that the sign refers for his errand boy, who runs to deliver hot water in a kettle whenever required.

He also acknowledges the influence of ''[[Mahanagar]]'' (1963), another Ray film noted for its portrayal of Kolkata. According to the director, he was inspired by particular scenes of Ray's ''[[Nayak (1966 film)|Nayak]]'' (1966) to plan the portrayal of complex emotional issues between Vidya and the police officer Rana, especially Rana's awe in the presence of Vidya. Ghosh expresses his inspiration from Ray's ''[[Aranyer Dinratri]]'' (1970) in which Ray "wanted the audience to be inside the car with the four guys all the time. So the camera never leaves the car." Ghosh shot a similar scene, hoping the audience would become "like Vidya's fellow passenger."<ref name="gupta ghosh interview tt">{{cite news
