'''Johannesburg''' ({{IPA-nl|jo<U+02C8>h<U+0251>n<U+0259>s<U+02CC>b<U+028F>rx|af}}) also known as '''Jozi''' or '''Jo'burg''', is the largest city in [[South Africa]]. Johannesburg is the [[province|provincial]] [[Capital (political)|capital]] of [[Gauteng]], the wealthiest province in South Africa, having the largest economy of any metropolitan region in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]. The city is one of the 40 largest [[metropolitan area]]s in the world<ref>[http://www.citypopulation.de/world/Agglomerations.html Principal Agglomerations of the World<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and it is one of Africa's only six [[global city|global cities]], the other being [[Cairo]], [[Cape Town]], [[Casablanca]], [[Nairobi]] and [[Port Louis]].<ref>[http://www.lboro.ac.uk/gawc/rb/rb5.html GaWC Research Bulletin 5], GaWC, [[Loughborough University]], 28 July 1999</ref>. While Johannesburg is not officially one of [[South Africa#Politics|South Africa's three capital cities]], it does house the [[Constitutional Court of South Africa|Constitutional Court]]{{ndash}} South Africa's highest court. 

Johannesburg is the source of a large-scale [[gold]] and [[diamond]] [[trade]], due to its location on the [[mineral]]-rich [[Witwatersrand]] range of hills. Johannesburg is served by [[O.R. Tambo International Airport]], the largest and busiest [[airport]] in Africa and a gateway for international air travel to and from the rest of [[southern Africa]].

According to the 2007 Community Survey, the population of the municipal city {{Clarify|date=October 2009}} was 3,888,180 and the population of the [[Greater Johannesburg Metropolitan Area]] was 7,151,447 {{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}. A broader definition of the Johannesburg [[metropolitan area]], including [[Ekhuruleni]], the [[West Rand]], [[Soweto]] and [[Lenasia]], has a population of 10,267,700 {{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}. The municipal city's land area of {{convert|1645|km2|abbr=on}} is very large when compared to other cities, resulting in a moderate [[population density]] of {{convert|2364|/km2|abbr=on}}.  

Johannesburg once again includes [[Soweto]], which was a separate city from the late 1970s until the 1990s.  Originally an acronym for "SOuth-WEstern TOwnships", Soweto originated as a collection of settlements on the outskirts of Johannesburg populated mostly by native African workers in the gold mining industry.  Eventually incorporated into Johannesburg, the [[apartheid]] regime (in power 1949 - 1994) separated Soweto from the rest of Johannesburg to make it a completely Black area.  [[Lenasia]] is also part of Johannesburg.

[[Gauteng]] is growing rapidly due to mass urbanisation which is a feature of many [[Developing country|developing countries]]. According to the State of the Cities Report, the urban portion of Gauteng{{ndash}} comprised primarily of the cities of Johannesburg, [[Ekurhuleni]] (the [[East Rand]]) and [[Tshwane]] (greater [[Pretoria]]){{ndash}} will be a [[Conurbation|polycentric urban region]] with a projected population of some 14.6 million people by 2015.<ref>http://www.sacities.net/2006/pdfs/cities_2006.pdf</ref>

==History==
{{Main|History of Johannesburg}}

[[File:langlaagte.jpg|thumb|left|The [[farm]] where [[gold]] was first discovered in 1886.]]
The region surrounding Johannesburg was originally inhabited by [[San (tribe)|San tribes]]. By the 1200s, groups of [[Bantu]]-speaking peoples started moving southwards from central Africa and encroached on the indigenous San population. By the mid 1700s, the broader region was densely settled by various [[Sotho-Tswana]] communities (one linguistic branch of Bantu-speakers), whose villages, towns, chiefdoms and kingdoms stretched from what is now [[Botswana]] in the west, to present day [[Lesotho]] in the south, to the present day [[Northern Sotho language|Pedi]] areas of the northern Transvaal.
{{History of South Africa}}
More specifically, the stone-walled ruins of [[Sotho-Tswana]] towns and villages are scattered around the parts of the former Transvaal in which Johannesburg is situated.  The Sotho-Tswana practiced farming, raised cattle, sheep and goats, and extensively mined and smelted copper, iron and tin.  Moreover, from the early 1960s until his retirement, Professor Revil Mason, of the [[University of the Witwatersrand]], explored and documented many Late [[Iron Age]] archeological sites throughout the Johannesburg area, dating from between the 1100s and 1700s, and many of these sites contained the ruins of Sotho-Tswana mines and iron smelting furnaces, suggesting that the area was being exploited for its mineral wealth before the arrival of Europeans or the discovery of gold.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}  The most prominent site within Johannesburg is [[Melville, Gauteng|Melville]] Koppies, which contains an iron smelting furnace.
Many Sotho-Tswana towns and villages in the areas around Johannesburg were destroyed and their people driven away during the wars emanating from [[Zulu Kingdom|Zululand]] during the late 1700s and early 1800s (the mfecane or difaqane wars), and as a result, an offshoot of the Zulu kingdom, the [[Ndebele people (Zimbabwe)|Matabele]], set up a kingdom to the northwest of Johannesburg around modern day [[Hartbeespoort, North West|Hartebeestpoort]] and [[Rustenburg, North West|Rustenburg]], and historians believe that the Matebele kingdom dominated the Johannesburg area.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}  The Dutch speaking [[Voortrekkers]] arrived in the early 1800s, driving away the Matebele with the help of Sotho-Tswana allies, establishing settlements around Rustenburg and Pretoria in the early 1830s, and claiming sovereignty over what would become Johannesburg as part of the South African Republic or Transvaal Republic.  [[Gold]] was discovered in the 1880s and triggered the [[Witwatersrand Gold Rush|gold rush]].
Gold was initially discovered some 400&nbsp;km to the east of present-day Johannesburg, in [[Barberton, South Africa|Barberton]]. [[Prospecting|Gold prospectors]] soon discovered that there were even richer gold reefs in the [[Witwatersrand]]. Gold was discovered at Langlaagte, Johannesburg in 1886.

Johannesburg was a dusty settlement some 55&nbsp;km from the Transvaal Republic capital which was [[Pretoria]]. The town was much the same as any small prospecting settlement, but, as word spread, people flocked to the area from all other regions of the country, as well as from North America, the United Kingdom and Europe.<ref>{{cite book
| first = Charles 
| last = van Onselen
| title =  New Nineveh and New Babylon}}</ref>. As the value of control of the land increased, tensions developed between the [[Boer]] government in Pretoria and the [[United Kingdom|British]], culminating in the [[Jameson Raid]] that ended in fiasco at [[Doornkop]] in January 1896 and the [[Second Boer War]] (1899-1902) that saw British forces under [[Lord Roberts]] occupy the city on 30 May 1900 after a series of battles to the south of its then-limits. 

[http://www.defenceweb.co.za/index.php?option=com_remository&Itemid=401&func=select&id=5/ Fighting took place] at the Gatsrand Pass (near Zakariyya Park) on 27 May, north of Vanwyksrust -today's Nancefield, Eldorado Park and Naturena - the next day, culminating in a mass infantry attack on what is now the waterworks ridge in Chiawelo and Senaoane on 29 May.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}           

Controversy surrounds the origin of the name, as there were any number of people with the name "Johannes" who were involved in the early history of the city. The principal clerk attached to the office of the surveyor-general, Johannes Rissik, Christiaan Johannes Joubert, member of the [[Volksraad]] and the Republic's chief of mining, [[Paul Kruger]], President of the Zuid Afrikaansche Republiek ([[Transvaal]]). Rissik and Joubert were members of a delegation sent to England to attain mining rights for the area. Joubert had a park in the city named after him and Rissik street is today a main street where the (now dilapidated) Post Office and City Hall are located.

During the [[South Africa under apartheid|apartheid]] era, Johannesburg was divided into 11 local authorities, seven of which were white and four [[Black people#South_Africa|black]] or [[coloured]]. The white authorities were 90% self-sufficient from [[property tax]] and other local [[tax]]es, and spent [[South African Rand|ZAR]] 600 ([[USD]] 93) per person, while the black authorities were only 10% self-sufficient, spending R 100 (USD 15) per person. {{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

The first post-apartheid City Council was created in 1995.  The council adopted the slogan "One City, One Taxpayer" in order to highlight its primary goal of addressing unequal tax revenue distribution.  To this end, revenue from wealthy, traditionally white areas would help pay for services needed in poorer, black areas. The City Council was divided into four regions, each with a [[autonomous region|substantially autonomous]] local regional authority that was to be overseen by a central metropolitan council. Furthermore, the municipal boundaries were expanded to include wealthy satellite towns like [[Sandton]] and [[Randburg]], poorer neighbouring townships such as [[Soweto]] and [[Alexandra, South Africa|Alexandra]], and informal settlements like [[Orange Farm]].

In 1999, Johannesburg appointed a city manager in order to reshape the city's ailing financial situation. {{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} The manager, together with the Municipal Council, drew up a blueprint called "Igoli 2002". This was a three-year plan that called upon the government to sell non-core assets, restructure certain utilities, and required that all others become self-sufficient. The plan took the city from near [[insolvency]] to an operating [[surplus]] of R 153 million (USD 23.6 million). {{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

Following the creation of the City of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality, Johannesburg was divided into eleven administrative regions (these regions did not correspond to the areas governed by the former local authorities). In 2006, the number of administrative regions was consolidated, from eleven to seven.[http://joburgnews.co.za/citichat/2006/apr10_citichat11.stm]<!--404 error<ref>[http://www.joburg.org.za/2006/may/may11_structure.stm Jozi plans major restructuring] by Anish Abraham, Official website of the City of Johannesburg, {{date|2006-05-11}}.</ref>-->

==Crime==
After the [[Group Areas Act]] was scrapped in 1991, Johannesburg was affected by [[urban blight]]. Thousands of poor, mostly black people, who had been forbidden to live in the city proper, moved into the city from surrounding black townships like [[Soweto]] and many immigrants from economically beleaguered and war torn African nations flooded into South Africa, with Johannesburg the most Northerly major city and therein a logical choice. Many buildings were abandoned by [[landlord]]s, especially in high-density areas, such as [[Hillbrow]]. Many corporations and institutions, including the [[JSE Securities Exchange|stock exchange]], moved their headquarters away from the city centre, to suburbs like [[Sandton]]. 

Reviving the city centre is one of the main aims of the municipal government of Johannesburg. Drastic measures have been taken to reduce crime in the city. These measures include [[closed-circuit television]] on street corners. As of December 11 2008, every street corner in Johannesburg central is under high-tech [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]] surveillance.<ref name="iol.co.za">[http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&click_id=13&art_id=vn20081211055919975C608175], IOL - Joburg Surveillance Zooms In, {{date|2008-12-11}}.</ref> The CCTV system, operated by the Johannesburg Metropolitan Police Department (JMPD), is also able to detect stolen or hijacked vehicles by scanning the number plates of every vehicle traveling through the [[Central business district]] (CBD), then comparing them to the eNaTIS database. The CCTV system has proven to be very effective. The average response time by police for crimes committed in the CBD is under 60 seconds.<ref name="iol.co.za"/> 

Crime levels in Johannesburg have dropped as the economy has stabilised and begun to grow.<ref>[http://www.mg.co.za/articlePage.aspx?articleid=276659&area=/breaking_news/breaking_news__national/ Drop in serious crime in Jo'burg], Mail & Guardian Online, {{date|2006-07-07}}.</ref> Between 2001 and 2006, R9-Billion (US$1.2 Billion) has been invested in the city centre. Further investment of around R10-Billion (US$ 1.5 Billion) is expected in the city centre alone by 2010. This excludes development directly associated with the 2010 FIFA World Cup.{{Dead link|date=July 2009}}<ref>[http://www.engineeringnews.co.za/article/joburg-039-s-residential-projects-are-supporting-an-acceleration-of-the-rejuvenation-effort-2007-05-25], engineeringnews.co.za - Joburg's residential projects are supporting an acceleration of the rejuvenation effort , {{date|2007-05-25}}.</ref> In an effort to prepare Johannesburg for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]], local government has enlisted the help of former New York mayor [[Rudolph Giuliani]] to help bring down the crime rate, as the opening and closing matches of the tournament will be played in the city.<ref>Press Release 6 August 2006, [http://www.24-7pressrelease.com/view_press_release.php?rID=16863 City of Johannesburg is calling for Internal Branding Advice from Global Gurus].</ref>

==Geography==
Johannesburg is located in the eastern plateau area of South Africa known as the [[Highveld]], at an elevation of {{m to ft|1753|precision=0|spell=commonwealth|wiki=yes}}. The former [[Central business district|CBD]] is located on the south side of the prominent ridge called the [[Witwatersrand]] ([[Afrikaans]]: White Water's Ridge) and the terrain falls to the north and south. By and large the Witwatersrand marks the watershed between the Limpopo and Vaal rivers. The north and west of the city has undulating hills while the eastern parts are flatter.

==Climate==
Johannesburg features a [[Oceanic climate|Subtropical highland climate]]. The city enjoys a dry, sunny climate, with the exception of occasional late afternoon downpours in the summer months of October to April. {{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} Temperatures in Johannesburg are usually fairly mild due to the city's high altitude, with the average maximum daytime temperature in January of {{convert|26|C}}, dropping to an average maximum of around {{convert|16|C}} in June. Winter is the sunniest time of the year, with cool days and cold nights. The temperature occasionally drops to below freezing at night, causing [[frost]]. [[Snow]] is a rare occurrence, with snowfall having been experienced in May 1956, August 1962, June 1964, September 1981 and August 2006 (light). Snow fell again on 27 June 2007,<ref>{{Cite web

  |accessdate = 2007-07-16}}</ref> accumulating up to {{convert|10|cm}} in the southern suburbs. 
Regular cold fronts pass over in winter bringing very cold southerly winds but usually clear skies. The annual average rainfall is {{convert|713|mm}}, which is mostly concentrated in the summer months. Infrequent showers occur through the course of the winter months.

Despite the relatively dry climate, Johannesburg has over ten million trees,<ref>[http://www.joburg.org.za/content/view/408/201/ Jozi's urban forest now at {{convert|10|m|adj=on}} trees, and growing] by Lucille Davie, {{date|2004-09-08}}.</ref> and it is now the biggest man-made forest in the world, followed by Graskop in Mpumalanga that is the second biggest.<ref>[http://www.joburg.org.za/content/view/452/58/ Joburg advertises its successes] by Ndaba Dlamini, {{date|2006-02-15}}.</ref> Many trees were originally planted in the northern areas of the city at the end of the 19th century, to provide wood for the mining industry. The areas were developed by the [[Randlord]], [[Hermann Eckstein]], a German immigrant, who called the forest estates Sachsenwald. The name was changed to Saxonwold, now the name of a suburb, during [[World War I]]. Early (white) residents who moved into the areas (Parkhurst, Parktown, Parkview, Westcliff, Saxonwold, Houghton Estate, Illovo, Hyde Park, Dunkeld, Melrose, Inanda, Sandhurst) now collectively referred to as the Northern Suburbs retained many of the original trees and planted new ones, with the encouragement of successive city councils. In recent years, however, a considerable number of trees have been felled, to make way for the Northern Suburbs' residential and commercial redevelopment.

Johannesburg is one of the most modern and prosperous cities in South Africa. Due to its many different central districts Johannesburg would fall under the Multiple Nuclei Model in Human Geography terms. It is the hub of South Africa's commercial, financial, industrial, and mining undertakings. Johannesburg is part of a larger urban region. It is closely linked with several other satellite towns. [[Randburg]] and [[Sandton]] form part of the northern area. The east and west ridges spread out from central Johannesburg. The Central Business District covers an area of 6 square kilometres. It consists of closely packed skyscrapers such as the [[Carlton Centre]], [[Marble Towers]], [[Trust Bank Building]], [[Ponte City Apartments]], [[Southern Life Centre]] and [[11 Diagonal Street]]. 

=== Architecture ===
Johannesburg is home to some of [[Africa]]'s tallest structures, such as the [[Sentech Tower]], [[Hillbrow Tower]] and the [[Carlton Centre]]. The Johannesburg city skyline has most of the tallest buildings on the continent and contains most international organisations such as [[IBM]], [[Absa]], [[BHP Billiton]], [[Willis Group]], [[First National Bank]], [[Nedbank]] and [[Standard Bank]]. Many of the city's older buildings have been pulled down and more modern ones built in their place. North of the CBD is [[Hillbrow]], the most densely populated residential area in southern Africa. Northwest of the CBD is [[Braamfontein]], a secondary CBD housing many offices and business premises.

=== Parks and gardens ===
{{Main|Johannesburg City Parks}}
Parks and gardens in Johannesburg are maintained by [[Johannesburg City Parks]].<ref name="cityparks-whoweare">{{cite web|url=http://www.jhbcityparks.com/who-we-are/|title=Custodians of Joburg's green heritage|publisher=Johannesburg City Parks|accessdate=2008-09-29}}</ref> They are also responsible for maintaining and planting the millions of trees in Johannesburg.

[[Johannesburg Botanical Garden]], located in the suburb of [[Emmarentia, Gauteng|Emmarentia]], is a popular recreational park.

===Residential Areas===

Johannesburg's residential areas range from luxurious, wooded suburbs, to shanty towns and squatter settlements. Alexandra, a township northeast of the city centre, is home to about 125,000 people. It was established by workers who migrated from rural areas in the late 1930s. Since the 1980s, large numbers of people have moved to Johannesburg in search of work. A lack of housing in the city has forced many to set up squatter settlements on the outskirts of the city. Most of these communities lack electricity and running water, and residents live in makeshift shacks made of scrap metal,board, and other discarded materials. In some settlements, such as Phola Park south of Johannesburg, town planners have attempted to build streets and provide residents with basic needs.

==Economy==
Johannesburg is one of the world's leading financial centres <ref>http://www.assr.nl/conferences/documents/StaffsempaperBourgouinnov.2008.pdf.</ref> and it is the economic and financial hub of South Africa, producing 16% of South Africa's [[gross domestic product]], and accounts for 40% of Gauteng's economic activity.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}<!--"page not found" link<ref name="sa2010-joburg">{{cite web|url=http://www.sa2010.gov.za/southafrica/hostcities.php|title=Johannesburg|work=2010 Communication Project Management Unit|publisher=Government Communication and Information System (GCIS)|accessdate=2008-09-29}}</ref>-->  In a 2007 survey conducted by MasterCard, Johannesburg ranked 47 out of 50 top cities in the world as a worldwide centre of commerce (the only city in Africa) <ref>http://www.mastercard.com/us/company/en/wcoc/pdf/WCoC_Brochure_FINAL.pdf</ref>.

[[Mining]] was the foundation of the [[Witwatersrand]]'s economy, but its importance is gradually declining due to dwindling reserves and service and manufacturing industries have become more significant to the city's economy. While gold mining no longer takes place within the [[city limits]], most mining companies still have their [[headquarters]] in Johannesburg. The city's manufacturing industries extend across a range of areas and there is still a reliance on heavy industries including [[steel]] and [[cement]] plants. The service and other industries include banking, IT, real estate, transport, broadcast and print media, private health care, transport and a vibrant leisure and consumer retail market. {{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} Johannesburg has Africa's largest stock exchange, the [[JSE Limited|JSE]] although it has moved out of the central business district. Due to its commercial role, the city is the seat of the provincial government and the site of a number of government branch offices, as well as consular offices and other institutions.

There is also a significant informal economy consisting of cash-only street traders and vendors. {{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} The level of this economic activity is difficult to track in official statistics and it supports a sector of the population including immigrants who are not in formal employment. However, it is clear that the informal economy operating in Johannesburg is certainly one of the biggest in the world.

The Witwatersrand urban complex is a major consumer of water in a dry region. Its continued economic and population growth has depended on schemes to divert water from other regions of South Africa and from the highlands of [[Lesotho]], the biggest of which is the Lesotho Highlands Water Project, but additional sources will be needed early in the 21st century.

The container terminal at City Deep is known to be the largest "dry port" in the world, with some 60% of cargo that arrives through the port of [[Durban]] and [[Cape Town]] arriving in Johannesburg. The City Deep area has been declared an IDZ (industrial development zone) by the Gauteng government, as part of the [[Blue IQ Project]].

===Retail===
Johannesburg's largest shopping centre is [[Sandton City]], while [[Hyde Park Corner (Shopping Centre)|Hyde Park]] is one of its most prestigious. Other centres include [[Rosebank]], [[Eastgate shopping centre, Johannesburg|Eastgate]], [[Westgate Shopping Centre|Westgate]], [[Northgate Shopping Centre, Johannesburg|Northgate]], [[Southgate Shopping Centre|Southgate]], The Glen Shopping centre, Johannesburg South, and [[Cresta Shopping Centre|Cresta]]. There are also plans to build a large shopping centre, known as the Zonk'Izizwe Shopping Resort, in [[Midrand]]. "Zonk'Izizwe" means "All Nations" in [[Zulu|Zulu language]], indicating that the centre will cater to the city's diverse mix of peoples and races. Also a complex named Greenstone in Modderfontein has been opened and is intended to become the largest shopping complex in the southern hemisphere<ref>http://architectafrica.com/bin0/features-GreenstoneMall-Bentel-05.html</ref>.

==Communications and media==
[[File:Radiopark.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Radiopark|Radiopark Centre]] with the [[Sentech Tower]] in the background. The Radiopark Centre is one of the most visible landmarks throughout the north-western suburbs.]]
The city is home to several media groups which own a number of newspaper and magazine titles. The two main print media groups are Independent Newspapers and Naspers (Media24). The electronic media is also headquartered in the greater metropolitan region. ''[[Beeld]]'' is a leading [[Afrikaans]] newspaper for the city and the country{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}, while the ''[[City Press (South Africa)|City Press]]'' is a Sunday newspaper that is the third largest selling newspaper in South Africa{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}. ''[[The Sowetan]]'' is one of a number of titles catering for the black market although in recent years it competes against newly arrived tabloids. The ''[[Mail & Guardian]]'' is an investigative liberal newspaper while ''[[The Citizen (newspaper, South Africa)|The Citizen]]'' is a [[tabloid]]-style paper, and ''[[The Star (South Africa)|The Star]]'' is a local newspaper that mostly covers [[Gauteng]]-related issues. The ''[[The Sunday Times (South Africa)|Sunday Times]]'' is the most widely read national Sunday newspaper{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}. True Love is the most widely read women's magazine{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}, catering primarily to the up and coming middle class black female market, published by Media 24. [[The Times]] is a national newspaper that covers current issues.  

Media ownership is relatively complicated with a number of cross shareholdings which have been rationalised in recent years resulting in the movement of some ownership into the hands of black shareholders. This has been accompanied by a growth in black editorship and journalism. 

Johannesburg has a number of regional radio stations such as [[YFM]], Metro FM, [[Phalaphala FM]], Talk Radio 702, [[94.7 Highveld Stereo|Highveld Stereo]], [[5FM]], UJ FM and Kaya FM and Classic FM. The number of radio stations has increased in recent years as the government sold off frequencies to private companies. Johannesburg is also the headquarters of state-owned broadcaster [[South African Broadcasting Corporation]] and pay broadcast network Multichoice which distributes [[M-Net]] and DStv a digital satellite service, while [[etv (South Africa)|eTV]] also has a presence in the city. etv is the only other terrestrial broadcaster and it is free-to-air and funded by advertising revenue. The city has two television towers, the [[Hillbrow Tower]] and the [[Sentech Tower]].

Johannesburg has 4 Major Cellular Telecommunisations operators: [[Vodacom]], [[MTN|MTN Group]], [[Cell C]], and [[Virgin Mobile]]. Vodacom's Global Headquarters is located in [[Midrand]]. It was formed in 1994, just after the South African Elections of 1994.<ref>http://www.africanwireless.com/vodacom_history.htm</ref>

==Music==
[[File:Hilbrow Tower.jpg|thumb|left|120px|The [[Hillbrow Tower]], one of Johannesburg's two telecommunications towers.]]
[[File:Sentech Tower.jpg|thumb|right|90px|The [[Sentech Tower]], the other of Johannesburg's two telecommunications towers.]]
[[Kwaito]] is the musical genre from Johannesburg that is considered to be the post-struggle (post-apartheid) music of choice by South African youth.  Some consider Kwaito to be apolitical dance music because the same lyrics are typically repeated throughout the entire song and are placed over the rhythms and beats of [[House music]].

Kwaito has touched more than the music scene in South Africa. In recent years, it has become deeply embedded in young South African culture because it represents "the streets", street life, and the people who live there.  As Grant Clark notes after his trip to Johannesburg, "Kwaito has evolved its own street style.  It's not just music, it's the way you walk, talk, dance, and of course, dress." <ref name=autogenerated1>Clark, Grant. "Kwaito: The Voice of Youth." From BBC World Service "Rhythms of the Continent: South Africa". http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/africa/features/rhythms/southafrica.shtml</ref>

==Suburbs==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2009}}
{{Main|Suburbs of Johannesburg}}
Johannesburg's suburbs are the product of extensive urban sprawl and are regionalised into north, south, east and west, and they generally have different personalities. While the [[Central Business District (Johannesburg)|Central Business District]] and the immediate surrounding areas were formerly desirable living areas, the spatial accommodation of the suburbs has tended to see a flight from the city and immediate surrounds. The inner city buildings have been let out to the lower income groups and illegal immigrants and as a result abandoned buildings and crime have become a feature of inner city life.  The immediate city suburbs include [[Yeoville, Gauteng|Yeoville]], a hot spot for black nightlife despite its otherwise poor reputation. The suburbs to the south of the city are mainly blue collar neighbourhoods and situated closer to some [[Township (South Africa)|townships]]. The suburbs to the west have in recent years floundered with the decline of the mining industry but have in some cases experienced some revival with properties being bought up by the black middle class. The biggest sprawl lies to the east and north. The eastern suburbs are relatively prosperous and close to various industrial zones. The northern suburbs have been the recipient of most of the flight from the inner city and some residential areas have become commercialised particularly around the area of Sandton, stretching north towards Midrand, a half way point between Johannesburg and the capital Pretoria.

Traditionally the northern and northwestern suburbs have been the centre for the wealthy, containing the high-end retail shops as well as several upper-class residential areas such as Hyde Park, Sandhurst, Northcliff and [[Houghton, South Africa|Houghton]], where [[Nelson Mandela]] makes his home. The northwestern area in particular is vibrant and lively, with the mostly-black suburb of [[Sophiatown, Gauteng|Sophiatown]] once centre of political activity and the Bohemian-flavoured [[Melville, Gauteng|Melville]] featuring restaurants and nightlife. [[Auckland Park]] is home to the headquarters of the [[South African Broadcasting Corporation]], [[AFDA]] (The South African School of Motion Picture and Live Performance) and the [[University of Johannesburg]].

To the southwest of the City Centre is [[Soweto]], a mostly black urban area constructed during the apartheid regime specifically for housing African people who were then living in areas designated by the government for white settlement. 

To the south of Johannesburg is [[Lenasia]], a mostly Asian area which was constructed during the Apartheid era specifically to house Asians. It is closer to the city centre and smaller than Soweto.

==Tourism==

[[File:Trust0.jpg|thumb|left|One of the numerous skyscrapers of the city.]]
Johannesburg has not traditionally been known as a tourist destination, but the city is a transit point for connecting flights to [[Cape Town]], [[Durban]], and the [[Kruger National Park]]. Consequently, most international visitors to South Africa pass through Johannesburg at least once, which has led to the development of more attractions for tourists. Recent additions have centred around [[History of South Africa|history]] [[museums]], such as the [[Apartheid Museum]] and the [[Hector Pieterson Museum]]. [[Gold Reef City]], a large [[amusement park]] to the south of the Central Business District, is also a large draw for tourists in the city. The [[Johannesburg Zoo]] is also one of the largest in South Africa.

The city also has several [[art]] museums, such as the [[Johannesburg Art Gallery]], which featured South African and European landscape and figurative paintings. The [[Museum Africa]] covers the history of the city of Johannesburg, as well as housing a large collection of [[rock art]]. The [[Market Theatre]] complex attained notoriety in the 1970s and 1980s by staging anti-apartheid plays, and has now become a centre for modern South African playwriting. The [[Johannesburg Civic Theatre]] is South Africa's foremost [[Theatre#Producing_v._Presenting|"receiving house"]] of live entertainment - presenting world class theatre, both local and international [http://www.showbusiness.co.za/pages/about/about_intro.htm].

There is also a large industry around visiting former [[township (South Africa)|townships]], such as [[Soweto]] and [[Alexandra, South Africa|Alexandra]]. Most visitors to Soweto go to see the [[Mandela Museum]], which is located in the former home of [[Nelson Mandela]].

The  [[Cradle of Humankind]] [http://www.cradleofhumankind.co.za] a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] is {{convert|25|km}} to the northwest of the city. The [[Sterkfontein]] [[fossil]] site is famous for being the world's richest hominid site and produced the first adult ''[[Australopithecus africanus]]'' and the first near-complete skeleton of an early ''[[Australopithecine]]''. Other attractions in this area include the [[Lesedi Cultural Village]], while [[Magaliesburg, Gauteng|Magaliesburg]] and the [[Hartbeespoort Dam]] are popular weekend (and holiday) destinations for Johannesburg residents.

The Suburbs of [[Melville, Gauteng|Melville]], [[Newtown, Johannesburg|Newtown]], [[Parkhurst, Gauteng|Parkhurst]], [[Norwood, Gauteng|Norwood]] and [[Greenside, Gauteng|Greenside]] are popular for their [[bohemian]] atmosphere, street life, and many restaurants and bars.

==Sports teams and stadiums==
{{Johannesburg sports}}
[[File:Soccer City (june 2009).jpg|thumb|left|[[FNB Stadium]], also known as Soccer City, currently under re-construction.]]
Johannesburg's most popular sports by participation are [[football (soccer)|association football]], [[cricket]], [[rugby union]], and [[running]]. The [[Lions (rugby franchise)|Lions]], formerly the Cats, represent Johannesburg, [[North West (South African province)|North West]] and [[Mpumalanga]] in the Southern Hemisphere's [[Super 14]] Rugby Competition, which includes teams from [[South Africa]], [[Australia]], and [[New Zealand]]. 

Cricket is one of the more popular sports. In cricket, the [[Highveld Lions]] represent Johannesburg, the rest of Gauteng as well as the North West Province at the [[Wanderers Stadium]] which was the venue for the [[2003 Cricket World Cup]] Final in which Australia successfully defended their title. Wanderers Stadium hosted what many cricket fans consider the greatest ever [[One Day International cricket|ODI]] match in which [[Australia in South Africa, 5th ODI, 2006|South Africa successfully chased down 434 runs]]. They take part in the [[first-class cricket|first class]] [[SuperSport Series]], the [[limited overs cricket|one-day]] [[MTN Domestic Championship]] and the [[Twenty20]] [[Standard Bank Pro 20 Series]]. <br clear="all" style="clear: both;" /> 

Johannesburg also hosted matches from and the final of the [[ICC World Twenty20]]. in which India beat Pakistan in the final.

Early each Sunday morning, tens of thousands of runners gather to take part in informal runs organised by several athletic clubs. The city has several football clubs in the [[Premier Soccer League]] (PSL) and the First Division. In the PSL, the top Johannesburg teams are all fierce rivals and include [[Kaizer Chiefs Football Club|Kaizer Chiefs]] (also known as the ''Amakhosi''), [[Orlando Pirates Football Club|Orlando Pirates]] (also known as the ''Buccaneers'') and [[Moroka Swallows Football Club|Moroka Swallows]], based at the city's [[Ellis Park Stadium|Johannesburg]], [[Rand Stadium|Rand]], and [[FNB Stadium|FNB stadiums]] respectively. [[Wits University Football Club|Witwatersrand University]], nicknamed the ''Clever Boys'', who have a player membership of over 1,500, one of the world's largest are also part of the premier league. First Division teams include Katlehong City and Alexandra United, who play at [[Alexandra Stadium|Alexandra]] and Reiger Park stadia respectively

[[File:Joburg kyalami.JPG|thumb|left|A view of Johannesburg from [[Kyalami]], a major motor race track in Johannesburg's northern suburbs.]]

==Transport==
Johannesburg, much like [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], is a young and sprawling city geared towards private motorists, and lacks a convenient public transportation system. A significant number of the city's residents are dependent on the city's informal minibus taxis.

[[File:Hillbrow.JPG|thumb|right|A street in [[Hillbrow]], the most densely populated residential area in Southern Africa.]]

===Airports===
[[File:OR Tambo International Airport Copyright2007KaihsuTai.jpg|right|thumb|OR Tambo International Airport Terminal B]]Johannesburg is served by [[OR Tambo International Airport]] (formerly '''Johannesburg International Airport''') for both domestic and international flights. Other airports include [[Rand Airport]], [[Grand Central Airport]], and [[Lanseria Airport|Lanseria]]. Rand Airport, located in [[Germiston, Gauteng|Germiston]], is a small airfield used mostly for private aircraft and the home of [[South African Airways]]'s first [[Boeing 747|Boeing 747 Classic]], the Lebombo, which is now an [[aviation]] [[museum]]. Grand Central is located in Midrand and also caters to small, private aircraft. [[Lanseria Airport]] is used for commercial flights to [[Cape Town]], [[Durban]], [[Port Elizabeth]], [[Botswana]], and [[Sun City, North West|Sun City]].

===Freeways===
{{Main|Johannesburg freeways}}
The fact that Johannesburg is not near a large navigable body of water has meant that ground transportation has been the most important method of transporting people and goods in and out of the city.  One of Africa's most famous "beltways" or ring roads/orbitals is the [[Johannesburg Ring Road]]. The road is composed of three [[freeway]]s that converge on the city, forming an {{convert|80|km|adj=on}} loop around it: the [[N3 Eastern Bypass (South Africa)|N3 Eastern Bypass]], which links Johannesburg with [[Durban]]; the [[N1 Western Bypass (South Africa)|N1 Western Bypass]], which links Johannesburg with [[Pretoria]] and [[Cape Town]]; and the [[N12 Southern Bypass (South Africa)|N12 Southern Bypass]], which links Johannesburg with [[Witbank]] and [[Kimberley, Northern Cape|Kimberley]]. The [[N3 road (South Africa)|N3]] was built exclusively with [[asphalt]], while the [[N12 (South Africa)|N12]] and [[N1 road (South Africa)|N1]] sections were made with [[concrete]], hence the nickname given to the N1 Western Bypass, "The Concrete Highway". In spite of being up to 12 lanes wide in some areas (6 lanes in either direction), the Johannesburg Ring Road is frequently clogged with traffic. The Gillooly's Interchange, built on an old farm and the point at which the N3 Eastern Bypass and the [[R24 (Gauteng)|R24 Airport Freeway]] intersect, is the busiest interchange in the Southern Hemisphere. It is also claimed{{Who|date=January 2008}} that the N1 is the busiest road in South Africa.

[[File:Johannesburg Beyers Naud<U+00E9> Drive.jpg|thumb|left|Busy side street off [[Beyers Naud<U+00E9> Drive]] in Cresta, Gauteng.]]

Johannesburg has the most freeways connected to it.{{Clarify|date=July 2009}} It has the [[N1 road (South Africa)|N1]], [[N3 road (South Africa)|N3]], [[N12 road (South Africa)|N12]], [[N14 road (South Africa)|N14]], [[N17 road (South Africa)|N17]], [[R21 (Gauteng)|R21]], [[R24 (Gauteng)|R24]] and the [[R59 (Free State)|R59]], all leading to Johannesburg. The [[M1 (Johannesburg)|M1]] and [[M2]] freeways were built to direct traffic towards the city centre. These two freeways are congested due to mass urbanisation.

===Taxis===
[[File:Mininus-taxi.JPG|thumb|A full minibus taxi.]]
Johannesburg has two kinds of taxis, [[taxicab|metered taxis]] and [[minibus taxi]]s.  Unlike many cities, metered taxis are not allowed to drive around the city looking for passengers and instead must be called and ordered to a destination. The Gauteng Provincial Government has launched a new metered taxi programme in an attempt to increase use of metered taxis in the city. {{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

The minibus "taxis" are the ''de facto'' standard and essential form of transport for the majority of the population. Since the 1980s The minibus taxi industry has been severely affected by [[Taxi wars in South Africa|turf wars]].

===Mass transit===
Johannesburg's [[Metrorail (South Africa)|metro railway]] system connects central Johannesburg to [[Soweto]], [[Pretoria]], and most of the satellite towns along the [[Witwatersrand]]. The railways transport huge numbers of workers everyday.  However, the railway infrastructure was built in Johannesburg's infancy and covers only the older areas in the city's south. The northern areas, including the business districts of [[Sandton, Gauteng|Sandton]], [[Midrand, Gauteng|Midrand]], [[Randburg, Gauteng|Randburg]], and [[Rosebank, Gauteng|Rosebank]], currently lack rail infrastructure.

====Trains====
A part of the Gauteng Provincial Government's Blue IQ Project, [[Gautrain]] has make provision for the creation of a rapid [[railway|rail]] link, running north to south, between Johannesburg and Pretoria, and west to east between Sandton and [[Johannesburg International Airport]]. Construction of the [[Gautrain]] Rapid Rail started in October 2006 and will be completed by 2011. It will consist of a number of underground stations, as well as above ground stations.  Stations on the northern line include Johannesburg's Park Station, [[Rosebank]], [[Sandton]], [[Midrand]] and [[Pretoria]]. There will also be a line from the [[OR Tambo International Airport]] traveling to Sandton. 

The east-west line from the airport to Sandton is planned to be operational in time for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] in June 2010.

The rail system is being designed to alleviate traffic on the [[N1 (South Africa)|N1]] freeway between Johannesburg and Pretoria, which records vehicle loads of up to 300,000 per day.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}. An extensive bus feeder system is also being implemented, which will allow access to the main stations from the outer suburbs. This will be the first new railway system that has been laid in South Africa since 1977.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}.

====Buses====
Johannesburg is served by a [[bus]] fleet operated by [http://www.mbus.co.za/ Metrobus], a corporate unit of the City of Johannesburg. It has a fleet consisting of approximately 550 single and double-decker buses, plying 84 different routes in the city. This total includes 200 modern buses (150 double-deckers and 50 single-deckers), made by [[Volvo]] and Marcopolo/Brasa in 2002. Metrobus' fleet carries approximately 20 million passengers per annum. In addition there are a number of private bus operators, though most focus on the inter-city routes, or on bus charters for touring groups. The City's main bus terminus is situated in Gandhi Square, where passengers can also obtain information regarding the Metrobus service from the walk-in customer information desk.

[[PUTCO]] also operated buss routes in and around the city.

====Rea Vaya - Bus Rapid Transit====
Rea Vaya started its Starter Service to the public on the 31<sup>st</sup> of August 2009. This starter service includes a Trunk Route (Thokoza Part to Ellis Park) and two inner city loops.

Costs:

Trunk Route - R5.00

Inner City Route - R3.00

Tickets are valid for 2 hrs and allow any number of transfers.

The City of Johannesburg has completed construction on its new Phase 1A [[Bus Rapid Transit|Bus Rapid Transit (BRT)]] system. The BRT project, titled Rea Vaya (We are moving), aims to rid the city's roads of congestion and promote safe, efficient and reliable public transport. It will run seven days a week, from 05h00 until midnight. Bus frequencies will be between two and five minutes during peak hours, and seven and ten minutes during the off-peak. The system will operate on main roads throughout the city, running down designated median lanes. Rea Vaya will also offer additional, smaller feeder-buses to areas around each BRT station to ensure speedy connections from homes to main routes. The BRT stations will be located every 500m along each BRT route, offering ticket vending machines and live travel information. Larger BRT stations will also offer sales kiosks, bathrooms and park and ride facilities. The BRT system has been designed with other transport modes in mind, so as to ensure a smooth change from various transportation options - particularly with the [[Gautrain]]. The first phase of the BRT is intended to be up and running in time for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]].

==Education and Culture==
[[File:The Wits University East Campus (archived).jpg|thumb|left|The [[University of the Witwatersrand]]. [[Braamfontein]] buildings are visible in the background.]]
Johannesburg has a well-developed [[higher education]] system of both [[private university|private]] and [[public university|public universities]]. Johannesburg is served by the public universities [[University of the Witwatersrand]] and the [[University of Johannesburg]].

[[University of Johannesburg]] was formed on 1 January 2005 when three separate universities and campuses<U+2014>[[Rand Afrikaans University]], [[Technikon Witwatersrand]], and the Johannesburg campuses of [[Vista University]]<U+2014>were merged. The new university offers education primarily in English and [[Afrikaans]], although courses may be taken in any of South Africa's official languages.

The [[University of the Witwatersrand]] is one of the leading universities in South Africa, and is famous as a centre of resistance to [[apartheid]].

Private universities include [[Monash University]], which has one of its eight campuses in Johannesburg (six of the other campuses are in Australia, while the eighth is in [[Malaysia]]), and [[Midrand Graduate Institute]] which is located in Midrand.

Johannesburg also boasts one of the finest [[film schools]] in the world; winning amongst others  the Academy Award's Oscar for Best Foreign Student Film in 2006.<ref>[http://www.gfo.co.za/content/GFOcongratulatesAFDAonAcademyMaywin065.doc], 23 May 2006</ref> The South African School of Motion Picture and Live Performance, or [[AFDA]] for short, is situated in Auckland Park.

Johannesburg also has three teacher-training colleges and a technical college. There are numerous kindergartens, primary schools and high schools in the region. Libraries, art galleries and museums are plentiful. One of them is MuseumAfrica, located in the CBD.<ref>www.johannesburg-direct.com/activity/visit-museum-africa</ref> Specialist museums cover subjects such as Africana, costume, design, [[fossils]], [[geology]], [[military history]], [[medical]], [[pharmacy]], [[photography]] and transportation networks such as [[railways]]. [[Gold Reef City]], a living museum, was originally part of the Crown Mines Complex, where gold was mined to a depth of {{convert|3000|m}}. The Market Theatre stages plays, comedy shows, and musical performances. The Civic Theatre complex hosts [[drama]], [[opera]] and [[ballet]].[[File:GiantWheel.jpg|thumb|The Giant Wheel, a ferris wheel found at Gold Reef City]]
