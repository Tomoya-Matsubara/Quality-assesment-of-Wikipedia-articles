'''Hurricane Daniel''' was the second strongest [[Pacific hurricane|hurricane]] of the [[2006 Pacific hurricane season]]. The fourth [[List of tropical cyclone names|named storm]] of the season, Daniel originated on July&nbsp;16 from a [[tropical wave]] off the coast of [[Mexico]]. It tracked westward, intensifying steadily to reach peak winds of 150&nbsp;mph (240&nbsp;km/h) on July&nbsp;22. At the time, the characteristics of the cyclone resembled those of an [[annular hurricane]]. Daniel gradually weakened as it entered an area of cooler water temperatures and increased wind shear, and after crossing into the [[Central Pacific Hurricane Center|Central Pacific Ocean]], it quickly degenerated into a remnant low pressure area on July&nbsp;26. 

Initial predictions suggested that the cyclone would pass through the [[Hawaiian Islands]] as a tropical storm. However, Daniel's remnants passed south of [[Hawaii (island)|Hawaii]] before fully dissipating. The storm brought light to moderate precipitation to the islands of Hawaii and [[Maui]], causing minor flooding, although no major damage or fatalities were reported.

==Meteorological history==
{{storm path|Daniel 2006 track.png}}
Hurricane Daniel began as a [[tropical wave]] that moved off the west coast of [[Africa]] on July&nbsp;2. The wave moved across the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and [[Caribbean Sea]] with little associated [[convection (meteorology)|convection]], and on July&nbsp;12, it crossed [[Central America]] into the eastern [[Pacific Ocean]]. Convection increased on July&nbsp;13, and two days later the system began to exhibit signs of tropical development to the south of [[Mexico]].<ref name="tcr">{{cite web|author=Jack Beven|year=2006|title=Hurricane Daniel Tropical Cyclone Report|publisher=[[National Hurricane Center]]|accessdate=2007-07-18|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/pdf/TCR-EP052006_Daniel.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref> It tracked westward at about 15&nbsp;mph (25&nbsp;km/h), and on July&nbsp;16, the disturbance became better organized.<ref name="716two">{{cite web|author=Stewart & Rhome|year=2006|title=July 16 Tropical Weather Outlook|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2007-07-18|url=ftp://ftp.met.fsu.edu/pub/weather/tropical/Outlook-P/2006071616.ABPZ20}}</ref> With convective [[tropical cyclone#structure|rainbands]] near an associated low-level circulation,<ref name="disc1">{{cite web|author=Beven|year=2006|title=Tropical Depression Five-E Discussion One|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2007-07-29|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2006/ep05/ep052006.discus.001.shtml?}}</ref> it is estimated the tropical wave spawned a tropical depression late on July&nbsp;16. At the time, it was located about 525&nbsp;miles (845&nbsp;km) south-southwest of [[Manzanillo, Colima]].<ref name="tcr"/>

Classified as Tropical Depression Five-E, the system tracked westward under the steering currents of a mid-level [[ridge (meteorology)|ridge]].<ref name="disc1"/> In the hours after formation, the depression lacked a concentration of deep convection near the center. Conditions favored [[tropical cyclogenesis|development]], including warm [[sea surface temperatures]], very low amounts of [[wind shear]], and an established [[anticyclone]] over the cyclone.<ref name="disc2">{{cite web|author=Pasch|year=2006|title=Tropical Depression Five-E Discussion Two|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2007-07-29|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2006/ep05/ep052006.discus.002.shtml?}}</ref> Convection became more centralized, coinciding with the improvement of upper-level [[outflow (meteorology)|outflow]].

When Hurricane Daniel was forecast to pass through the Hawaiian islands as a tropical storm, state and [[Hawaii County, Hawaii|Hawaii County]] officials recommended residents prepare hurricane kits; they also suggested purchasing non-perishable foods and batteries. Initially, the storm was several days away from potentially affecting the state, and as a result few residents rushed to prepare.<ref>{{cite web|author=Rod Thomson|date=2006-07-25|title=Weakening Hurricane Daniel still a concern for Big Isle|publisher=''Honolulu Star-Bulletin''|accessdate=2007-12-29|url=http://archives.starbulletin.com/2006/07/25/news/story01.html}}</ref> The Honolulu [[National Weather Service]] issued a high surf advisory for east facing beaches in Hawaii, and warned beachgoers to remain out of the water.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]]|year=2006|title=Hurricane Season 2006: Daniel (Eastern Pacific)|accessdate=2007-12-29|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hurricanes/archives/2006/h2006_daniel.html}}</ref> The National Weather Service issued a [[flash flood]] watch and wind advisory in association with the remnants of Daniel.<ref>{{cite web|author=Honolulu National Weather Service|year=2006|title=July 2006 Tropical Weather Statements|accessdate=2007-12-29|url=http://elists.pdc.org/pipermail/emops/2006-July.txt|format=TXT}}</ref>
