The '''Abbey Church of Saint Peter and Saint Paul, Bath''', commonly known as '''Bath Abbey''', is an [[Anglican]] [[parish church]] and a former [[Benedictine]] [[monastery]] in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], [[Somerset]], England. Founded in the 7th&nbsp;century, Bath Abbey was reorganised in the 10th century and rebuilt in the 12th and 16th&nbsp;centuries; major [[Victorian restoration|restoration work]] was carried out by Sir [[George Gilbert Scott]] in the 1860s. It is one of the largest examples of [[Perpendicular (architecture)|Perpendicular]] [[Gothic architecture]] in the [[West Country]].

The church is [[cruciform]] in [[floor plan|plan]], and is able to seat 1200. An active place of worship, with hundreds of congregation members and hundreds of thousands of visitors each year, it is used for religious services, secular civic ceremonies, concerts and lectures. The choir performs in the abbey and elsewhere. There is a heritage museum in the vaults.

The abbey is a Grade I [[listed building]],<ref name="IoE">{{cite web | title=Bath Abbey | work=[[Images of England]]|url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=442109 |publisher=[[English Heritage]] | accessdate=25 September 2007}}</ref><ref name="pastscape" /> particularly noted for its [[fan vaulting]] ceiling. It contains war memorials for the local population and monuments to several notable people, in the form of wall and floor plaques and commemorative [[stained glass]]. The church has two organs and a peal of ten bells. The west front includes sculptures of angels climbing to heaven on two stone ladders.

==History==
===Early history===
[[File:Himnastigi.jpg|left|thumb|100px|The sculptures of angels climb [[Jacob's Ladder]] on the west front of Bath Abbey]]
In 675 [[Osric of the Hwicce|Osric]], King of the [[Hwicce]], granted the Abbess Berta 100 [[Hide (unit)|hides]] near Bath for the establishment of a [[convent]]. This religious house became a [[monastery]] under the patronage of the [[Bishop of Worcester]].
[[Monarch|King]] [[Offa of Mercia|Offa]] of [[Mercia]] successfully wrested "that most famous monastery at Bath"<ref name="Poliquin" /> from the [[bishop]] in 781. [[William of Malmesbury]] tells that Offa rebuilt the monastic church, which may have occupied the site of an earlier [[Paganism|pagan]] temple, to such a standard that King [[Eadwig of England|Eadwig]] was moved to describe it as being "marvellously built";<ref name="Poliquin">{{cite web|title=Bath Abbey|url=http://www.uquebec.ca/musique/orgues/angleterre/batha.html#English | work=Robert Poliquin's Music and Musicians| publisher=Quebec University | accessdate=18 September 2007}}</ref> little is known about the architecture of this first building on the site. [[Monasticism]] in England had declined by that time, but Eadwig's brother [[Edgar of England|Edgar]] (who was crowned "King of the English" at the abbey in 973<ref name="Edgar">{{cite web |url=http://www.englishmonarchs.co.uk/saxon_12.htm |title=Edgar the Peaceful |accessdate=18 December 2007 |work=English Monarchs&nbsp;<U+2013> Kings and Queens of England }}</ref>) began its revival on his accession to the throne in 959. He encouraged monks to adopt the [[Rule of St Benedict]], which was introduced at Bath under Abbot <U+00C6>lfheah ([[St. Alphege]]).

===Norman Conquest to the Dissolution===
Bath was ravaged in the power struggle between the sons of [[William the Conqueror]] following his death in 1087. The victor, [[William Rufus]], granted the city to a royal [[physician]], [[John of Tours]], who became Bishop of [[Wells]] and [[Abbot]] of Bath.<ref name=Powicke205>Powicke p.205</ref><ref name="Barlow 2000 182">Barlow p.182</ref> Shortly after his consecration John bought Bath Abbey's grounds from the king,<ref name="Barlow 2000 182"/> as well as the city of Bath itself. Whether John paid Rufus for the city or whether he was given it as a gift by the king is unclear.<ref name=DNB>Ramsey "[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/14846 Tours, John of (d. 1122)]" ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''</ref> The abbey had recently lost its abbot, [[<U+00C6>lfsige II (bishop of Winchester)|<U+00C6>lfsige]], and according to [[Domesday Book]] was the owner of large estates in and near the city; it was likely the abbey's wealth that attracted John to take over the monastery.<ref name=Smith134>Smith "John of Tours" ''Downside Review'' pp.134<U+2013>135</ref> By acquiring Bath, John also acquired the mint that was in the city.<ref name=Mason130>Mason p.130</ref> In 1090 he transferred the seat, or administration, of the bishopric to Bath Abbey,<ref name=Handbook227>Fryde p.227</ref><ref name=Huscroft128>Huscroft p.128</ref> probably in an attempt to increase the revenues of his see. Bath was a rich abbey, and Wells had always been a poor diocese. By taking over the abbey, John increased his episcopal revenues.<ref name=Williams136>Williams p.136</ref> [[William of Malmesbury]] portrays the moving of the episcopal seat as motivated by a desire for the lands of the abbey, but it was part of a pattern at the time of moving cathedral seats from small villages to larger towns.<ref name=DNB/> When John moved his episcopal seat, he also took over the abbey of Bath as his [[cathedral chapter]], turning his diocese into a bishopric served by monks instead of the [[Canon (priest)|canons]] at Wells who had previously served the diocese.<ref name=Monastic132>Knowles p.132</ref> John rebuilt the monastic church at Bath, which had been damaged during one of [[Robert de Mowbray]]'s rebellions. Permission was given to move the [[Episcopal see|see]] of Somerset from [[Wells Cathedral|Wells]]&nbsp;<U+2013> a comparatively small settlement&nbsp;<U+2013> to the then [[Defensive wall|walled]] [[city]] of Bath.<ref name="Barlow 2000 182" /><ref name="Huscroft128" />
When this was effected in 1090, John became the first Bishop of Bath, and St Peter's was raised to [[cathedral]] status.<ref>Dunning p.39</ref> As the roles of bishop and abbot had been combined, the monastery became a [[priory]], run by its [[prior]]. With the elevation of the abbey to cathedral status, it was felt that a larger, more up-to-date building was required. John of Tours planned a new cathedral on a grand scale, dedicated to [[Saint Peter]] and [[Paul the Apostle|Saint Paul]], but only the [[ambulatory]] was complete when he died in December 1122.<ref name=Powicke205/> He was buried in the cathedral.<ref name=BHOBath>{{cite web | url= http://british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=34341 | work= British History Online | title= Bishops of Bath and Wells 1066<U+2013>1300 |accessdate=27 September 2007}}</ref> The most renowned scholar monk based in the abbey was [[Adelard of Bath]]; after his various travels he was back in the monastery by 1106.<ref>Hylson-Smith pp.89<U+2013>90</ref>

The half-finished cathedral was devastated by fire in 1137,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=40919|title=The Cathedral Priory of Bath|last=Page|first=William|year=1911|work=History of the County of Somerset: Volume 2|publisher=British History Online|accessdate=17 May 2008}}</ref> but work continued under [[Godfrey of Bath|Godfrey]], the new bishop, until about 1156; the completed building was approximately {{convert|330|ft|m|0}} long. There were 40 monks on the roll in 1206.<ref name="wroughton"/> Joint cathedral status was awarded by [[Pope Innocent IV]] to [[Diocese of Bath and Wells|Bath and Wells]] in 1245.<ref>Hylson-Smith p.80</ref> [[Roger of Salisbury, bishop of Bath and Wells|Roger of Salisbury]] was appointed the first [[Bishop of Bath and Wells]], having been Bishop of Bath for a year previously. Later bishops preferred Wells, the canons of which had successfully petitioned various popes down the years for Wells to regain cathedral status. Bath Cathedral gradually fell into disrepair. In 1485 the priory had 22 monks.<ref name="wroughton">Wroughton pp.25<U+2013>38</ref> The existence of an ambulatory suggests a very large building, on a par with [[Durham Cathedral]].

When [[Oliver King]], Bishop of Bath and Wells 1495<U+2013>1503, visited Bath in 1499 he was shocked to find this famous church in ruins.<ref name="sacreddest">{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-destinations.com/england/bath-abbey|title=Bath Abbey, Bath|work=Scared Destinations|accessdate=17 January 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://visitbath.co.uk/site/things-to-do/attractions/bath-abbey-p24001 |title=Bath Abbey |accessdate=17 January 2011 |work=Visit Bath }}</ref> He also described lax discipline, idleness and a group of monks "all too eager to succumb to the temptations of the flesh".<ref name="wroughton"/> He took a year to consider what action to take, before writing to the Prior of Bath in October 1500 to explain that a large amount of the priory income would be dedicated to rebuilding the cathedral.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.buildinghistory.org/bath/abbey/dream.shtml | last=Manco | first=Jean | title=Oliver King's Dream | publisher=Bath Past | accessdate=17 January 2011}}</ref> Work probably began the following spring. Bishop King planned a smaller church, covering the area of the Norman nave only.<ref name="wroughton"/> He did not live to see the result, but the restoration of the cathedral was completed just a few years before the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] in 1539.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thecityofbath.co.uk/renaissance_bath.htm |title=Renaissance Bath |accessdate=9 December 2007 |work=City of Bath }}</ref> The new church is not a typical example of the [[Perpendicular (architecture)|Perpendicular]] form of [[Gothic architecture]]; the low aisles and [[Arcade (architecture)|nave arcades]] and the very tall clerestory present the opposite balance to that which was usual in perpendicular churches. As this building was to serve as a monastic church, it was built to a cruciform plan, which had become relatively rare in parish churches of the time. The interior contains fine [[fan vaulting]] by [[Robert Vertue|Robert]] and [[William Vertue]], who designed similar vaulting for the Henry VII chapel, at [[Westminster Abbey]]. The building has 52 windows, occupying about 80% of the wall space,<ref name="sacreddest"/> giving the interior an impression of lightness, and reflecting the different attitudes towards churchmanship shown by the clergy of the time and those of the 12th century.{{-}}

===Reformation and subsequent decline===
Prior Holloway surrendered Bath Priory to the crown in January 1539. The church was stripped of lead, iron and glass and left to decay. In 1574, [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]] promoted the restoration of the church, to serve as the grand parish church of Bath. She ordered that a national fund should be set up to finance the work.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.frommers.com/destinations/bath/A25243.html |title=Bath Abbey |accessdate=27 September 2007 |work=Fromers Guide }}</ref> [[James Montague (bishop of Bath and Wells)|James Montague]], the Bishop of Bath and Wells from 1608<U+2013>1616, paid <U+00A3>1,000 for a new nave roof of timber lath construction; according to the inscription on his tomb, this was prompted after seeking shelter in the roofless nave during a thunderstorm. He is buried in an [[alabaster]] tomb in the north aisle.<ref>Hylson-Smith p.132</ref>

===Modern renaissance===
[[File:Bath cathedrale choeur.jpg|thumb|right|The nave showing the [[fan vaulting]] of the [[nave]] ceiling]]
Major [[Victorian restoration|restoration work]] was carried out by Sir [[George Gilbert Scott]] in the 1860s, funded by the rector, Charles Kemble. The work included the installation of fan vaulting in the nave, which was not merely a fanciful aesthetic addition but a completion of the original design.<ref name="ingentaconnect">{{cite journal|last=Luxford|first=Julian M|title=In Dreams: The sculptural iconography of the west front of Bath Abbey reassessed|journal=Religion and the Arts|volume=4|issue=3|pages=314<U+2013>336|oclc=|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/brill/raa/2000/00000004/00000003/art00002|doi=10.1163/156852901750359103|year=2000}}</ref> Bishop King had arranged for the vaulting of the choir, to a design by William and Robert Vertue. There are clues in the stonework that King intended the vaulting to continue into the nave, but that this plan was abandoned, probably for reasons of cost. Work carried out in the 20th and 21st centuries included a full cleaning of the stonework and the reconstruction of the [[pipe organ]] by [[Klais Orgelbau]] of [[Bonn]].

==Architecture==
[[File:Bath.abbey.flying.buttresses.closeup.arp.jpg|thumb|left|[[Flying buttress]]es and a [[pinnacle]] at the abbey]]

The cruciform abbey is built of [[Bath Stone]], which gives the exterior its yellow colour. It is not a typical example of the [[Perpendicular (architecture)|Perpendicular]] form of [[Gothic architecture]] with low aisles and [[Arcade (architecture)|nave arcades]] and a tall [[clerestory]]. The walls and roofs are supported by [[buttress]]es and surmounted by [[battlement]]s, [[pinnacle]]s and pierced [[parapet]]s, many of which were added by George Manners during his 1830's restorations.<ref name="pastscape"/><ref name=hist/>

The [[nave]], which has five bays, is {{convert|211|ft|m}} long and {{convert|35|ft|m}} wide to the pillars and rises to {{convert|75|ft|m}},<ref name="Perkins p.17">Perkins p.17</ref> with the whole church being {{convert|225|ft|m}} long and {{convert|80|ft|m}} wide.<ref>Britton p.72</ref>

The west front, which was originally constructed in 1520, has a large arched window and detailed carvings.<ref name="pastscape"/> Above the window are carvings of angels and to either side long stone ladders with angels climbing up them. Below the window a battlemented parapet supports a statue and beneath this, on either side of the door, are statues of St Peter and St Paul.<ref>Perkins pp.12<U+2013>15</ref> Restoration work in the late 20th century involved cleaning with electronically controlled intermittent water sprays and ammonium carbonate poultices. One of the figures which had lost its head and shoulders was replaced.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Astley|first=Gus|title=Bath Abbey: West Front|journal=Conservation News|year=1993|volume=51|pages=13<U+2013>14|url=http://www.ihbc.org.uk/context_archive/37/bath.htm}}</ref> The sculptures on the West front have been interpreted as representing "spiritual ascent through the virtue of humility and descent through the vice of pride"<ref name="ingentaconnect" /> and Christ as the Man of Sorrow and the Antichrist.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Luxford|first=Julian M.|title=More on the Sculpture of the West Front of Bath Abbey: Christ of the Charter and Antichrist|journal=Religion and the arts|year=2003|volume=7|issue=3|pages=299<U+2013>322|doi=10.1163/156852903322694654|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/brill/raa/2003/00000007/00000003/art00003|accessdate=16 September 2011}}</ref> During the 1990s a major restoration and cleaning work were carried out on the exterior stonework, returning it to the yellow colour hidden under centuries of dirt.<ref>Hylson-Smith p.184</ref>

===Windows===
[[File:Edgar and dunstan bath abbey.jpg|thumb|[[Stained glass]] window showing the coronation of [[King Edgar]] by [[Dunstan]]]]
The building has 52 windows, occupying about 80&nbsp;percent of the wall space. The east end has a square-framed window of seven lights.<ref name="sacreddest" /> It includes a depiction of the nativity made by [[Clayton and Bell]] in 1872,<ref>{{cite web|title=Nativity&nbsp;<U+2014> Bath Abbey Stained Glass Window Transfer New!|url=http://www.acnuk.org/products.php/306/nativity-bath-abbey-stained-glass-window-transfer|publisher=Aid to the Church in Need|accessdate=16 September 2011}}</ref> and was presented to the church by the Bath Literary Club.<ref>Perkins pp.17<U+2013>28</ref>

====Bells====
In 1700 the old ring of six bells was replaced by a new ring of eight. All but the tenor still survive. In 1770 two lighter bells were added to create the first ring of ten bells in the diocese. The tenor was recast in 1870.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.btinternet.com/~copson/BBC_Bells_diary.htm |title=Bells on Sunday Diary | year=2003 | accessdate=27 September 2007 | work=Bells on Sunday Diary}}</ref> The abbey's tower is now home to a [[Ring of bells|ring]] of ten [[Bell (instrument)|bells]], which are&nbsp;<U+2013> unusually&nbsp;<U+2013> hung so that the order of the bells from highest to lowest runs anti-clockwise around the ringing chamber.

===Interior===
The interior fan vaulting ceiling, originally installed by [[Robert Vertue|Robert]] and [[William Vertue]], was restored by Sir [[George Gilbert Scott]] between 1864 and 1874.<ref name=hist>{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.bathabbey.org/history|publisher=Bath Abbey|accessdate=14 September 2011}}</ref> The fan vaulting provides structural stability by distributing the weight of the roof down ribs that transfer the force into the supporting columns via the [[flying buttress]]es.<ref>{{cite web|last=McNally|first=Ben|title=Bath Abbey Roof System|url=https://www.facebook.com/topic.php?uid=417357455082&topic=12698|publisher=Facebook|accessdate=14 September 2011}}</ref>

Scott's work in the 1870s included the installation of large gas chandeliers made by the Coventry metalworker [[Francis Skidmore]]. They were converted to electricity in 1979.<ref>{{cite web|title=The late vistorians|url=http://www.bathabbey.org/history/todays-abbey-1535-onwards/late-victorians|publisher=Bath Abbey|accessdate=16 September 2011}}</ref> Other new features included a new pulpit and seating.

====Main organ====
The first mention of an organ in the abbey dates to 1634, but nothing is known of that instrument. The first properly recorded organ in Bath Abbey was built by [[Abraham Jordan]] in 1708. It was modified in 1718 and 1739 by Jordan's son.

It had 52 stops spread over four manuals and pedals,<ref name="NPOR&nbsp;<U+2014> Bath Abbey's N&B organ">{{cite web|title=Bath Abbey: The Norman & Beard organ|url=http://www.npor.org.uk/cgi-bin/Rsearch.cgi?Fn=Rsearch&rec_index=N05916 | work=The National Pipe Organ Register | publisher=British Institute of Organ Studies | year=1927 | accessdate=18 September 2007}}</ref> and stood divided on two steel beams in the North and South [[crossing (architecture)|crossing]] arches, with the [[organ console|console]] standing on the floor next to the north-west [[pier (architecture)|pier]] of the crossing. New cases were to be provided to designs by [[Brian Oliver (architect)|Brian Oliver]] of Bath, but were never executed.<ref name="Poliquin" /> Norman & Beard re-erected it in a new case designed by [[Thomas Graham Jackson|Sir Thomas Jackson]] in the North Transept in 1914, with the addition of two stops to the Pedal.<ref name="Poliquin" />
It was again rebuilt by them in 1930, and then by [[William Hill & Son and Norman and Beard Ltd.|Hill, Norman and Beard]] in 1948, which brought the number of stops to 58.<ref name="NPOR&nbsp;<U+2014> Bath Abbey's HNB organ">{{cite web|title=Bath Abbey: The Hill, Norman & Beard organ|url=http://www.npor.org.uk/cgi-bin/Rsearch.cgi?Fn=Rsearch&rec_index=N05917 | work=The National Pipe Organ Register | publisher=British Institute of Organ Studies | year=1950 | accessdate=18 September 2007}}</ref> In 1972 this was increased to a total of 65 speaking stops. The Positive division, with its separate case behind the [[organ console|console]], was installed at the same time. Problems caused by the tonal scheme's lack of coherence&nbsp;<U+2013> the 1895 pipework contrasting sharply with that of 1972&nbsp;<U+2013> and with reliability, caused by the wide variety of different types of key actions, all difficult to access, led to the decision to have the instrument rebuilt yet again.

The organ was totally reconstructed in 1997 by [[Klais Orgelbau]] of [[Bonn]], retaining the existing instrument as far as was possible and restoring it largely to its 1895 condition, although the Positive division was kept.<ref name="NPOR&nbsp;<U+2014> Bath Abbey's Klais organ">{{cite web|title=Bath Abbey: The Klais organ|url=http://www.npor.org.uk/cgi-bin/Rsearch.cgi?Fn=Rsearch&rec_index=D03828 | work=The National Pipe Organ Register | publisher=British Institute of Organ Studies | year=1997 | accessdate=18 September 2007}}</ref> The instrument as it now stands has 63 speaking stops over four manuals and pedals,<ref name="Klais Orgelbau&nbsp;<U+2014> Bath Abbey">{{cite web|title=Klais Orgelbau: Bath Abbey|url=http://www.orgelbau-klais.com/m.php?tx=1 | publisher=Klais Orgelbau | accessdate=18 September 2007}}</ref> and is built largely on the Werkprinzip principle of organ layout: the case is only one department deep, except for parts of the Pedal sited at the back rather than the sides of the case. New 75&nbsp;percent tin front pipes were made and the case completed with back, side walls and roof. Pierced panelling executed by Derek Riley of Lyndale Woodcarving in [[Saxmundham]], [[Suffolk]], was provided to allow sound egress from the bottom of the case. The old console has been retained but thoroughly rebuilt with modern accessories and all-new manuals. Twenty-two of the organ's 83 ranks contain some pipework from the 1868 instrument. Four ranks are made up entirely of 1868 pipework, and 21 contain 1895 pipework. Only two ranks are entirely of 1895. Forty-eight ranks contain some new pipework, 34 of which are entirely new. Old wind pressures have been used wherever possible. The old wind reservoirs have also been restored rather than replaced. The instrument has [[Tracker action|tracker key action]] on the manuals, with electrically assisted tracker action to the pedals. The stop action is electric throughout.

====Continuo organ====
A four-stop continuo organ was built for the abbey in 1999 by [[Northampton]]-based [[organ builder]] [[Kenneth Tickell]].<ref name="NPOR&nbsp;<U+2014> Bath Abbey's Tickell continuo organ">{{cite web|title=Bath Abbey: The Tickell continuo organ|url=http://www.npor.org.uk/cgi-bin/Rsearch.cgi?Fn=Rsearch&rec_index=R00041 | work=The National Pipe Organ Register | publisher=British Institute of Organ Studies | year=2000 | accessdate=18 September 2007}}</ref> The instrument, contained in a case of dark oak, is portable, and can be tuned to three [[Pitch (music)|pitches]]: A=440&nbsp;Hz (modern concert pitch), A=415&nbsp;Hz and A=486&nbsp;Hz. A lever pedal can reduce the stops sounding to only the 8' stop and, when released, returns the organ to the registration in use before it was depressed.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.tickell-organs.co.uk/gallery20.htm | title=Representative Examples of Continuo Organs| publisher=Kenneth Tickell and Company | accessdate=17 January 2011}}</ref>

==Choir==
The abbey has sections for boys, girls and men. As well as singing at the abbey, they also tour to cathedrals in the UK and Europe. The choir has broadcast [[Evening Prayer (Anglican)|Choral Evensong]] on [[BBC Radio 3]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Choral Evensong from Bath Abbey|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio3/choralevensong/pip/v2b4z/ | work=[[BBC Radio 3]] webpages| publisher=[[BBC Online]]| accessdate=27 September 2007}}</ref> and has made several recordings. It performed at the [[The Three Tenors|Three Tenors]] concert for the opening of the [[Thermae Bath Spa]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Choirs|url=http://www.bathabbey.org/music/choirs|publisher=Bath Abbey|accessdate=16 September 2011}}</ref> The abbey is also used as a venue for visiting choirs and, from its inception in 1947, the [[City of Bath Bach Choir]].<ref>{{cite web|title=City of Bath Bach Choir|url=http://www.bathbachchoir.org.uk/|publisher=City of Bath Bach Choir|accessdate=16 September 2011}}</ref>

==Heritage Vaults Museum==
The Bath Abbey Heritage Vaults Museum is located in the restored 18th-century cellars, and features artifacts and exhibits about the abbey's history. Displays include the different buildings on the site and their uses, the abbey's impact on the community, the construction, architecture and sculptures of the buildings, artifacts and sculptures, and the role of the abbey in present times.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bath Abbey Heritage Vaults 1993 & Monuments Survey 1995|url=http://www.laurencetindall.co.uk/page109.html|publisher=Laurence Tindall|accessdate=16 September 2011}}</ref> The museum opened in 1994,<ref>{{cite web|title=Bath Abbey|url=http://www.smoothhound.co.uk/tourism/bath/abbey.html|publisher=Smooth Hound Hotel Guide|accessdate=16 September 2011}}</ref> but is currently closed for redevelopment.
