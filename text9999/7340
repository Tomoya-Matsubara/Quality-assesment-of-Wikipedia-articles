'''English''' is a [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic language]] that was first spoken in [[Anglo-Saxon England|early medieval England]] and is now a global [[lingua franca]].{{sfn|Crystal|2003a|p=6}}{{sfn|Wardhaugh|2010|p=55}} It is an [[official language]] of [[list of territorial entities where English is an official language|almost 60 sovereign states]], the most commonly spoken language in the [[United Kingdom]], the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], and [[New Zealand]], and a widely spoken language in countries in the [[Caribbean]], Africa, and southeast Asia.{{sfn|Crystal|2003b|pp=108<U+2013>109}} It is the [[List of languages by number of native speakers|third most common native language]] in the world, after [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]].{{sfn|Ethnologue|2010}} It is widely learned as a [[second language]] and is an [[Official languages of the United Nations|official language of the United Nations]], of [[Languages of the European Union|the European Union]], and of many other world and regional international organisations.

English has developed over the course of more than 1,400 years. The earliest forms of English, a set of [[Anglo-Frisian languages|Anglo-Frisian dialects]] brought to [[Great Britain]] by [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon settlers]] in the fifth century, are called [[Old English]]. [[Middle English]] began in the late 11th century with the [[Norman conquest of England]].{{sfn|Crystal|2003b|p=30}} [[Early Modern English]] began in the late 15th century with the introduction of the [[printing press]] to London and the [[Great Vowel Shift]]. Through the worldwide influence of the [[British Empire]], Modern English spread around the world from the 17th to mid-20th centuries. Through newspapers, books, the telegraph, the telephone, phonograph records, radio, satellite television, and the Internet, as well as the emergence of the United States as a global [[superpower]], English has become the [[World language|leading language]] of international discourse and the lingua franca in many regions and in professional contexts such as science.

There is little morphological inflection in Modern English, and the syntax is generally isolating. English relies on auxiliary verbs and word order for the expression of complex tenses, aspect and mood, as well as passive constructions, interrogatives and negation. Despite noticeable variation between the forms of English spoken in different world regions, English-speakers from around the world can communicate with one another effectively. Different accents are distinguished only by phonological differences from the standard language, whereas dialects also display grammatical and lexical differences.

==Classification==
[[File:Westgermanic English tree.svg|thumb|400px|right|Phylogenetic tree showing the historical relations between the languages of the West Germanic branch of the Germanic languages.]]

English is an [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European language]], and belongs to the [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic]] group of the [[Germanic languages]].{{sfn|Bammesberger|1992|pp=29<U+2013>30}} Most closely related to English are the [[Frisian languages]], and English and Frisian form the [[Anglo-Frisian languages|Anglo-Frisian]] subgroup within West Germanic. Modern English descends from [[Middle English]], which in turn descends from [[Old English]].{{sfn|Robinson|1992}} English and all the Germanic languages descend from [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]]. Sometimes Anglo-Frisian is grouped with [[Old Saxon]] and its descendent [[Low German]] languages, as a group labelled "[[Ingvaeonic languages|Ingvaeonic]]" or "North Sea Germanic".{{sfn|Bammesberger|1992|p=30}} Middle English also developed into a number of other [[English languages]], including [[Scots language|Scots]]{{sfn|Romaine|1982|pp=56<U+2013>65}} and the extinct [[Fingallian]] and [[Forth and Bargy dialect]]s of [[Ireland]].{{sfn|Barry|1982|pp=86<U+2013>87}}

English is classified as a Germanic language because it shares new language features (different from other Indo-European languages) with other Germanic languages such as [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[German language|German]], and [[Swedish language|Swedish]].{{sfn|Durrell|2006}} These shared innovations show that the languages have descended from a single common ancestor, which linguists call Proto-Germanic. Some shared features of Germanic languages are the use of [[modal verb]]s, the division of verbs into [[Germanic strong verb|strong]] and [[Germanic weak verb|weak]] classes, and the sound changes affecting [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] consonants, known as [[Grimm's law|Grimm's]] and [[Verner's law]]s. Through Grimm's law, the word for ''foot'' begins with {{IPA|/f/}} in Germanic languages, but its [[cognate]]s in other Indo-European languages begin with {{IPA|/p/}}. English is classified as an Anglo-Frisian language because Frisian and English share other features, such as the [[palatalization (sound change)|palatalisation]] of consonants that were velar consonants in Proto-Germanic.{{sfn|K<U+00F6>nig|van der Auwera|1994}}

* English ''foot'', German ''Fu<U+00DF>'', Norwegian and Swedish ''fot'' (initial {{IPA|/f/}} derived from Proto-Indo-European {{PIE|*p}} through Grimm's law)

English, like the other insular Germanic languages, [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and [[Faroese language|Faroese]], developed independently of the continental Germanic languages and their influences. English is thus not [[Mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]] with any continental Germanic language, differing in [[lexis (linguistics)|vocabulary]], [[syntax]], and [[phonology]], although some, such as Dutch, do show strong affinities with English, especially with its earlier stages.{{sfn|Harbert|2007}}

Because English through its history has changed considerably in response to contact with other languages, particularly [[Old Norse]] and [[Norman language|Norman French]], some scholars have argued that English can be considered a [[mixed language]] or a [[Creole language|creole]]&nbsp;<U+2013> a theory called the [[Middle English creole hypothesis]]. Although the high degree of influence from these languages on the vocabulary and grammar of Modern English is widely acknowledged, most specialists in language contact do not consider English to be a true mixed language.{{sfn|Thomason|Kaufman|1988|pp=264<U+2013>265}}{{sfn|Watts|2011|loc=Chapter 4}}

{{main|Old English}}
The earliest form of English is called Old English or Anglo-Saxon (c.&nbsp;550<U+2013>1066&nbsp;CE). Old English developed from a set of [[Ingvaeonic languages|North Sea Germanic dialects]] originally spoken along the coasts of [[Frisia]], [[Lower Saxony]], [[Jutland]], and Southern [[Sweden]] by Germanic tribes known as the [[Angles]], [[Saxons]], and [[Jutes]]. In the fifth century, the Anglo-Saxons [[Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain|settled Britain]] and [[End of Roman rule in Britain|the Romans withdrew from Britain]]. By the seventh century, the Germanic language of the Anglo-Saxons became dominant in Britain, replacing the languages of [[Roman Britain]] (43<U+2013>409 CE): [[Common Brittonic]], a [[Celtic languages|Celtic language]], and [[Latin]], brought to Britain by the [[Caesar's invasions of Britain|Roman occupation]].{{sfn|Collingwood|Myres|1936}}{{sfn|Graddol|Leith|Swann et al.|2007}}{{sfn|Blench|Spriggs|1999}} ''England'' and ''English''  (originally ''Anglaland'' and ''Englisc'') are named after the Angles.{{sfn|Bosworth|Toller|1921}}

Old English was divided into four dialects: the Anglian dialects, [[Mercian dialect|Mercian]] and [[Northumbrian dialect|Northumbrian]], and the Saxon dialects, [[Kentish dialect|Kentish]] and [[West Saxon dialect|West Saxon]].{{sfn|Campbell|1959|p=4}} Through the educational reforms of [[Alfred the Great|King Alfred]] in the ninth century and the influence of the kingdom of [[Wessex]], the West Saxon dialect became the [[standard language|standard written variety]].{{sfn|Toon|1992|loc=Chapter: Old English Dialects}} The [[epic poetry|epic poem]] ''[[Beowulf]]'' is written in West Saxon, and the earliest English poem, ''[[C<U+00E6>dmon's Hymn]]'', is written in Northumbrian.{{sfn|Donoghue|2008}} Modern English developed mainly from Mercian, but the [[Scots language]] developed from Northumbrian. A few short inscriptions from the early period of Old English were written using a [[Anglo-Saxon runes|runic script]].{{sfn|Gneuss |2013|p=23}} By the sixth century, a [[Old English Latin alphabet|Latin alphabet]] was adopted, written with [[Uncial script#Half-uncial|half-uncial]] [[letterform]]s. It included the runic letters ''[[wynn]]'' {{lang|ang|<<U+01BF>>}} and ''[[Thorn (letter)|thorn]]'' {{lang|ang|<<U+00FE>>}}, and the modified Latin letters ''[[eth]]'' {{lang|ang|<<U+00F0>>}}, and ''[[<U+00C6>|ash]]'' {{lang|ang|<<U+00E6>>}}.{{sfn|Gneuss |2013|p=23}}{{sfn|Denison|Hogg|2006|pp=30<U+2013>31}}

Old English is very different from Modern English and difficult for 21st-century English speakers to understand. Its grammar was similar to that of modern [[German language|German]]. [[Old English grammar|Nouns, adjectives, pronouns, and verbs]] had many more [[Inflection#Inflectional morphology|inflectional endings and forms]], and word order was [[Word order#Pragmatic word order|much freer]] than in Modern English. Modern English has [[grammatical case|case forms]] in pronouns (''he'', ''him'', ''his'') and a few verb endings (''I have'', ''he has''), but Old English had case endings in nouns as well, and verbs had more [[grammatical person|person]] and [[grammatical number|number]] endings.{{sfn|Hogg|1992|loc=Chapter=Phonology and Morphology}}{{sfn|Smith|2009}}{{sfn|Trask|Trask|2010}}

The translation of Matthew 8:20 from 1000&nbsp;CE shows examples of case endings ([[nominative case|nominative]] plural, [[accusative case|accusative]] plural, [[genitive case|genitive]] singular) and a verb ending ([[present tense|present]] plural):
:''Foxas habba<U+00F0> holu and heofonan fuglas nest''

In the period from the 8th to the 12th century, Old English gradually transformed through [[language contact]] into [[Middle English]]. Middle English is often arbitrarily defined as beginning with the [[Norman conquest of England|conquest of England]] by [[William the Conqueror]] in 1066, but it developed further in the period from 1200<U+2013>1450.

First, the waves of Norse colonisation of northern parts of the British Isles in the 8th and 9th centuries put Old English into intense contact with [[Old Norse]], a [[North Germanic]] language. Norse influence was strongest in the Northeastern varieties of Old English spoken in the [[Danelaw]] area around York, which was the centre of Norse colonisation; today these features are still particularly present in [[Scots language|Scots]] and [[Northern England English|Northern English]]. However the centre of norsified English seems to have been in [[the Midlands]] around [[Kingdom of Lindsey|Lindsey]], and after 920 CE when [[Lindsey]] was reincorporated into the Anglo-Saxon polity, Norse features spread from there into English varieties that had not been in intense contact with Norse speakers. Some elements of Norse influence that persist in all English varieties today are the pronouns beginning with ''th-'' (''they, them, their'') which replaced the Anglo-Saxon pronouns with ''h-'' (''hie, him, hera'').{{sfn|Thomason|Kaufman|1988|pp=284<U+2013>290}}

With the [[Norman conquest of England]] in 1066, the now norsified Old English language was subject to contact with the [[Old Norman]] language, a [[Romance language]] closely related to Modern [[French language|French]]. The Norman language in England eventually developed into [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]]. Because Norman was spoken primarily by the elites and nobles, while the lower classes continued speaking Anglo-Saxon, the influence of Norman consisted of introducing a wide range of [[loanwords]] related to politics, legislation and prestigious social domains.{{sfn|Svartvik|Leech|2006|p=39}} Middle English also simplified the inflectional system. The distinction between nominative and accusative case was lost except in personal pronouns, the instrumental case was dropped, and the use of the genitive case was limited to describing [[Possession (linguistics)|possession]]. The inflectional system regularised many irregular inflectional forms,{{sfn|Lass|1992}} and gradually simplified the system of agreement, making word order less flexible.{{sfn|Fischer|van der Wurff|2006|pages=111<U+2013>13}} By the 1380s the [[Wycliffe Bible]] the passage Matthew 8:20 was written

:''Foxis han dennes, and briddis of heuene han nestis''<ref>{{cite web| last = Wycliffe | first = John | author-mask = 3 | url=http://wesley.nnu.edu/fileadmin/imported_site/wycliffe/wycbible-all.pdf | publisher = Wesley NNU | title = Bible}}</ref>

Here the plural suffix ''-n'' on the verb ''have'' is still retained, but none of the case endings on the nouns are present.

By the 12th century Middle English was fully developed, integrating both Norse and Norman features; it continued to be spoken until the transition to early Modern English around 1500. Middle English literature includes [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'', and [[Thomas Malory|Malory]]'s ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]''. In the Middle English period the use of regional dialects in writing proliferated, and dialect traits were even used for effect by authors such as Chaucer.

===Early Modern English===
{{main|Early Modern English}}
[[File:Great Vowel Shift2a.svg|right|300px|thumb|Graphic representation of the [[Great Vowel Shift]], showing how the pronunciation of the long vowels gradually shifted, with the high vowels i: and u: breaking into diphthongs and the lower vowels each shifting their pronunciation up one level.]]
The next period in the history of English was Early Modern English (1500<U+2013>1700). Early Modern English was characterised by the [[Great Vowel Shift]] (1350<U+2013>1700), inflectional simplification, and linguistic standardisation.

The Great Vowel Shift affected the stressed long vowels of Middle English. It was a [[chain shift]], meaning that each shift triggered a subsequent shift in the vowel system. [[Mid vowel|Mid]] and [[open vowel]]s were [[raising (phonology)|raised]], and [[close vowel]]s were [[vowel breaking|broken]] into [[diphthong]]s. For example the word ''bite'' was originally pronounced as the word ''beet'' is today, and the second vowel in the word ''about'' was pronounced as the word ''boot'' is today. The Great Vowel Shift explains many irregularities in spelling, since English retains many spellings from Middle English, and it also explains why English vowel letters have very different pronunciations from the same letters in other languages.{{sfn|Lass|2000}}{{sfn|G<U+00F6>rlach|1991|pp=66<U+2013>70}}

English began to rise in prestige during the reign of [[Henry V of England|Henry V]]. Around 1430, the [[Court of Chancery]] in [[Westminster]] began using English in its [[writ|official documents]], and a new standard form of Middle English, known as [[Middle English#Chancery Standard|Chancery Standard]], developed from the dialects of London and the [[East Midlands English|East Midlands]]. In 1476, [[William Caxton]] introduced the [[printing press]] to England and began publishing the first printed books in London, expanding the influence of this form of English.{{sfn|Nevalainen|Tieken-Boon van Ostade|2006|pages=274<U+2013>79}} Literature from the Early Modern period includes the works of [[William Shakespeare]] and the [[King James Version|translation of the Bible]] commissioned by [[James VI and I|King James I]]. Even after the vowel shift the language still sounded different from Modern English: for example, the [[consonant cluster]]s {{IPA|/kn gn sw/}} in ''knight'', ''gnat'', and ''sword'' were still pronounced. Many of the grammatical features that a modern reader of Shakespeare might find quaint or archaic represent the distinct characteristics of Early Modern English.{{sfn|Cercignani|1981}}

In the 1611 King James Version of the Bible, written in Early Modern English, Matthew 8:20 says:
:''The Foxes haue holes and the birds of the ayre haue nests''{{sfn|Lass|2006|pp=46<U+2013>47}}

This exemplifies the loss of case and its effects on sentence structure (replacement with Subject-Verb-Object word order, and the use of ''of'' instead of the non-possessive genitive), and the introduction of loanwords from French (''ayre'') and word replacements (''bird'' originally meaning "nestling" had replaced OE ''fugol'').

===Spread of Modern English===

In the late 18th century the [[Thirteen Colonies]] in North America became the first parts of the British empire to achieve independence, and the subsequent period saw English become a global, [[pluricentric language]]. As England continued to form new colonies, these in turn became independent and developed their own norms for how to speak and write the language. English was adopted in North America, India, parts of Africa, Australasia, and many other regions. In the post-colonial period, some of the newly created nations that had multiple [[indigenous language]]s opted to continue using English as the official language to avoid the political difficulties inherent in promoting any one indigenous language above the others.{{sfn|Romaine|2006|p=586}}{{sfn|Mufwene|2006|p=614}}{{sfn|Northrup|2013|pp=81<U+2013>86}} In the 20th century the growing economic and cultural influence of the United States and its status as a global [[superpower]] since the Second World War have significantly accelerated the spread of the language across the planet.{{sfn|Graddol|2006}}{{sfn|Crystal2003a}} By the 21st century, English was more widely spoken and written than any language has ever been.{{sfn|McCrum|MacNeil|Cran|2003|pp=9<U+2013>10}}

A major feature in the early development of Modern English was the codification of explicit norms for standard usage, and their dissemination through official media such as public education and state sponsored publications. In 1755 [[Samuel Johnson]] published his ''[[A Dictionary of the English Language]]'' which introduced a standard set of spelling conventions and usage norms. In 1828, [[Noah Webster]] published the ''[[Webster's Dictionary|American Dictionary of the English language]]'' in an effort to establish a norm for speaking and writing American English that was independent from the British standard. Within Britain, non-standard or lower class dialect features were increasingly stigmatised, leading to the quick spread of the prestige varieties among the middle classes.{{sfn|Romaine|1999|pp=1<U+2013>56}}

In terms of grammatical evolution, Modern English has now reached a stage where the loss of case is almost complete (case is now only found in pronouns, such as ''he'' and ''him'', ''she'' and ''her'', ''who'' and ''whom''), and where SVO word-order is mostly fixed.{{sfn|Romaine|1999|pp=1<U+2013>56}} Some changes, such as the use of [[do-support]] have become universalised. (Earlier English did not use the word "do" as a general auxiliary as Modern English does; at first it was only used in question constructions where it was not obligatory.{{sfn|Romaine|1999|p=2|quote=Other changes such as the spread and regularisation of do support began in the thirteenth century and were more or less complete in the nineteenth. Although do coexisted with the simple verb forms in negative statements from the early ninth century, obligatoriness was not complete until the nineteenth. The increasing use of do periphrasis coincides with the fixing of SVO word order. Not surprisingly, do is first widely used in interrogatives, where the word order is disrupted, and then later spread to negatives.}} Now, do-support with the verb ''have'' is becoming increasingly standardised.) The use of progressive forms in ''-ing'', appears to be spreading to new constructions, and forms such as ''had been being built'' are becoming more common. Regularisation of irregular forms also slowly continues (e.g. ''dreamed'' instead of ''dreamt''), and analytical alternatives to inflectional forms are becoming more common (e.g. ''more polite'' instead of ''politer''). British English is also undergoing change under the influence of American English, fuelled by the strong presence of American English in the media and the prestige associated with the US as a world power. {{sfn|Leech|Hundt|Mair|Smith|2009|pp=18<U+2013>19}}{{sfn|Mair|Leech|2006}}{{sfn|Mair|2006}}

==Geographical distribution==
{{anchor|Geographic distribution}}
{{See also|List of territorial entities where English is an official language|List of countries by English-speaking population|Anglosphere}}

As of 2010 359&nbsp;million people spoke English as their [[first language]]. English is probably the third largest language by number of native speakers, after [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]].{{sfn|Ethnologue|2010}} However, when combining native and non-native speakers it is probably the most commonly spoken language in the world.{{sfn|McCrum|MacNeil|Cran|2003|pp=9<U+2013>10}}{{sfn|Crystal|2003a|p=69}} English is spoken by communities on every continent and on oceanic islands in all the major oceans.{{sfn|Crystal|2003b|p=106}} The countries in which English is spoken can be grouped into different categories by how English is used in each country. The "inner circle"{{sfn|Svartvik|Leech|2006|p=2}} countries with many native speakers of English share an international standard of written English and jointly influence speech norms of English around the world. English does not belong to just one country, and it does not belong solely to descendants of English settlers. English is an official language of countries populated by few descendants of native speakers of English. It has also become by far the most important language of international communication when people who share no common language meet anywhere in the world.

===Three circles of English-speaking countries===

[[Braj Kachru]] distinguishes countries where English is spoken with a [[World Englishes#Kachru.27s Three Circles of English|three circles model]].{{sfn|Svartvik|Leech|2006|p=2}} In his model, the "inner circle" countries are countries with large communities of native speakers of English, "outer circle" countries have small communities of native speakers of English but widespread use of English as a second language for education or broadcasting or local official purposes, and "expanding circle" countries are countries where many learners learn English as a foreign language. Kachru bases his model on the history of how English spread in different countries, how users acquire English, and the range of uses English has in each country. The three circles change membership over time.{{sfn|Kachru|2006|p=196}}

Countries with large communities of native speakers of English include the United States, Britain, Australia, Canada, Ireland, and New Zealand, all countries with an English-speaking majority, and South Africa, where English is a significant minority language. The countries with the highest populations of native English speakers are, in descending order, the [[United States]] (at least 231&nbsp;million),{{sfn|Ryan|2013|loc=Table 1}} the [[United Kingdom]] (60&nbsp;million),{{sfn|Office for National Statistics|2013|loc=Key Points}}{{sfn|National Records of Scotland|2013}}{{sfn|Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency|2012|loc=Table KS207NI: Main Language}} Canada (19&nbsp;million),{{sfn|Statistics Canada|2014}} [[Australia]] (at least 17&nbsp;million),{{sfn|Australian Bureau of Statistics|2013}} South Africa (4.8&nbsp;million),{{sfn|Statistics South Africa|2012|loc=Table 2.5 Population by first language spoken and province (number)}} [[Ireland]] (4.2&nbsp;million), and New Zealand (3.7&nbsp;million).{{sfn|Statistics New Zealand|2014}} English spreads to new speakers in such countries as children grow up in English-speaking homes and as local people who speak other languages or new immigrants learn English to communicate in their neighbourhoods and workplaces. The English in these countries develops in the typical pattern of learning by children from parents of both grammar and vocabulary.{{sfn|Bao|2006|p=377}} These inner-circle countries provide the base from which English can spread everywhere else in the world.{{sfn|Kachru|2006|p=196}}

Estimates of the number of English speakers who are [[second language]] and foreign-language speakers vary greatly from 470&nbsp;million to more than 1,000 million depending on how proficiency is defined.{{sfn|Crystal|2003b|pp=108<U+2013>109}} Linguist [[David Crystal]] estimates that non-native speakers now outnumber native speakers by a ratio of 3 to 1.{{sfn|Crystal|2003a|p=69}} In Kachru's three-circles model, the "outer circle" countries are countries such as the [[Philippines]],{{sfn|Rubino|2006}} [[Jamaica]],{{sfn|Patrick|2006a}} India, Pakistan, Singapore,{{sfn|Lim|Ansaldo|2006}} and [[Nigeria]]{{sfn|Connell|2006}}{{sfn|Schneider|2007}} with a much smaller proportion of native speakers of English but much use of English as a second language for education, government, or domestic business, where English is routinely used for school instruction and official interactions with the government.{{sfn|Trudgill|Hannah|2008|p=5}} Those countries have millions of native speakers of [[dialect continuum|dialect continua]] ranging from an [[English-based creole languages|English-based creole]] to a more standard version of English. They have many more speakers of English who acquire English in the process of growing up through day by day use and listening to broadcasting, especially if they attend schools where English is the medium of instruction. Varieties of English learned by speakers who are not native speakers born to English-speaking parents may be influenced, especially in their grammar, by the other languages spoken by those learners.{{sfn|Bao|2006|p=377}} Most of those varieties of English include words little used by native speakers of English in the inner-circle countries,{{sfn|Bao|2006|p=377}} and they may have grammatical and phonological differences from inner-circle varieties as well. The standard English of the inner-circle countries is often taken as a norm for use of English in the outer-circle countries.{{sfn|Bao|2006|p=377}}

In the three-circles model, countries such as Poland, China, Brazil, Germany, Japan, Indonesia, Egypt, and other countries where English is taught as a foreign language make up the "expanding circle".{{sfn|Trudgill|Hannah|2008|p=4}} The distinctions between English as a first language, as a second language, and as a foreign language are often debatable and may change in particular countries over time.{{sfn|Trudgill|Hannah|2008|p=5}} English is unusual among world languages in how many of its users are not native speakers but speakers of English as a second or foreign language.{{sfn|Kachru|2006|p=197}} Many users of English in the expanding circle use it to communicate with other people from the expanding circle, so that interaction with native speakers of English plays no part in their decision to use English.{{sfn|Kachru|2006|p=198}} Non-native varieties of English are widely used for international communication, and speakers of one such variety often encounter features of other varieties.{{sfn|Bao|2006}} Very often today a conversation in English anywhere in the world may include no native speakers of English at all, even while including speakers from several different countries.{{sfn|Trudgill|Hannah|2008|p=7}}

===Pluricentric English===
English is a [[pluricentric language]], which means that no one national authority sets the standard for use of the language.{{sfn|Trudgill|Hannah|2008|p=2}}{{sfn|Romaine|1999}}{{sfn|Baugh|Cable|2002}}{{sfn|Trudgill|Hannah|2008|pp=8<U+2013>9}} But English is not a divided language,{{sfn|Ammon|2008|p=1539}} despite a long-standing joke that the United Kingdom and the United States are "two countries divided by a common language". Spoken English, for example English used in broadcasting, generally follows national pronunciation standards that are also established by custom rather than by regulation. International broadcasters are usually identifiable as coming from one country rather than another through their [[Accent (sociolinguistics)|accents]],{{sfn|Trudgill|2006}} but newsreader scripts are also composed largely in international [[standard written English]]. The norms of standard written English are maintained purely by the consensus of educated English-speakers around the world, without any oversight by any government or international organisation.{{sfn|Ammon|2008|pp=1537<U+2013>1539}} American listeners generally readily understand most British broadcasting, and British listeners readily understand most American broadcasting. Most English speakers around the world can understand radio programmes, television programmes, and films from many parts of the English-speaking world.{{sfn|Svartvik|Leech|2006|p=122}} Both standard and nonstandard varieties of English can include both formal or informal styles, distinguished by word choice and syntax and use both technical and non-technical registers.{{sfn|Trudgill|Hannah|2008|pp=5<U+2013>6}}

The settlement history of the English-speaking inner circle countries outside Britain helped level dialect distinctions and produce a [[Koin<U+00E9> language|koineised]] form of English in South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand.{{sfn|Deumert|2006|p=130}} The majority of immigrants to the United States without British ancestry rapidly adopted English after arrival. Now the majority of the United States popularity are monolingual English speakers.{{sfn|Deumert|2006|p=131}}{{sfn|Ryan|2013|loc=Table 1}}

===English as a global language===

English has ceased to be an "English language" in the sense of belonging only to people who are ethnically English.{{sfn|Romaine|1999|p=5}}{{sfn|Svartvik|Leech|2006|p=1}} Use of English is growing country-by-country internally and for international communication. Most learners of English learn English for practical rather than ideological reasons.{{sfn|Kachru|2006|p=195}} Many speakers of English in Africa have become part of an "Afro-Saxon" language community that unites Africans from different countries.{{sfn|Mazrui|Mazrui|1998}}

As decolonisation proceeded throughout the British Empire in the 1950s and 1960s, former colonies often did not reject English but rather continued to use it as independent countries setting their own language policies.{{sfn|Mufwene|2006|p=614}}{{sfn|Mesthrie|2010|p=594}}{{sfn|Northrup|2013|pp=81<U+2013>86}} For example the view of the [[Indian English|English language]] among many Indians has gone from associating it with colonialism to associating it with economic progress, and English continues to be an official language of India.{{sfn|Annamalai|2006}} English is also widely used in media and literature, and the number of English language books published annually in India is the third largest in the world after the US and UK.{{sfn|Sailaja|2009|pages=2<U+2013>9}} David Crystal claimed in 2004 that, combining native and non-native speakers, India now has more people who speak or understand English than any other country in the world,{{sfn|Crystal|2004b}} but the number of English speakers in India is very uncertain, with most scholars concluding that the United States still has more speakers of English than India.{{sfn|Graddol|2010}}

Modern English, sometimes described as the first global lingua franca,{{sfn|Meierkord|2006|p=165}}{{sfn|Graddol|2006}} is also regarded as the first [[world language]].{{sfn|Brutt-Griffler|2006|p=690<U+2013>91}}{{sfn|Northrup|2013}} English is the world's most widely used language in newspaper publishing, book publishing, international telecommunications, scientific publishing, international trade, mass entertainment, and diplomacy.{{sfn|Northrup|2013}} English is, by international treaty, the basis for the required [[controlled natural language]]s{{sfn|Wojcik|2006|p=139}} [[Seaspeak]] and Airspeak used as [[international auxiliary language|international language]]s of seafaring{{sfn|International Maritime Organization|2011}} and aviation.{{sfn|International Civil Aviation Organization|2011}} English has replaced German as the dominant language of scientific research.{{sfn|Gordin|2015}} It achieved parity with [[French language|French]] as a language of diplomacy at the [[Treaty of Versailles]] negotiations in 1919.{{sfn|Phillipson|2004|p=47}} By the time of the foundation of the [[United Nations]] after [[World War II]], English had become pre-eminent{{sfn|ConradRubal-Lopez|1996|p=261}} and is now the main worldwide language of diplomacy and international relations.{{sfn|Richter|2012|p=29}} It is one of six official languages of the United Nations.{{sfn|United Nations|2008}} Many other worldwide international organisations, including the [[International Olympic Committee]], specify English as a working language or official language of the organisation.

Many regional international organisations such as the [[European Free Trade Association]], [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN),{{sfn|Crystal|2003a}} and [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]] (APEC) set English as the organisation's sole working language even though most or all of the member countries are not countries with a majority of native speakers of English. While the European Union (EU) allows member states to designate any of the national languages as an official language of the Union, in practice English is the main working language of EU organisations.{{sfn|Ammon|2006|p=321}}

Although in most countries English is not an official language, it is currently the language most often taught as a [[foreign language]].{{sfn|Graddol|2006}}{{sfn|Crystal|2003a}} In the countries of the EU, English is the most widely spoken foreign language in nineteen of the twenty-five member states where it is not an official language (that is, the countries other than the UK and Ireland). In a 2012 official Eurobarometer poll, 38 percent of the EU respondents outside the countries where English is an official language said they could speak English well enough to have a conversation in that language. The next most commonly mentioned foreign language, French (which is the most widely known foreign language in the UK and Ireland), could be used in conversation by 12 percent of respondents.{{sfn|European Commission|2012|pp=21, 19}}

A working knowledge of English has become a requirement in a number of occupations and professions such as medicine{{sfn|Alcaraz Ariza|Navarro|2006}} and computing. English has become so important in scientific publishing that more than 80 percent of all scientific journal articles indexed by ''Chemical Abstracts'' in 1998 were written in English, as were 90 percent of all articles in natural science publications by 1996 and 82 percent of articles in humanities publications by 1995.{{sfn|Brutt-Griffler|2006|p=694<U+2013>95}}

This increasing use of the English language globally has had a great impact on many other languages, leading to a great many English words being borrowed into the vocabularies of other languages. This influence from English has led to concerns about [[language death]],{{sfn|Crystal|2002}} and to claims of [[linguistic imperialism]],{{sfn|Jambor|2007}} and has prompted resistance to the spread of English. But the number of speakers of English continues to increase because many learners around the world think that English provides them with opportunity for better employment and improved lives.{{sfn|Svartvik|Leech|2006|loc=Chapter 12: English into the Future}}

Although some scholars mention a possibility of future divergence of English dialects into mutually unintelligible languages, most think a more likely outcome is that English will continue to function as a [[Koin<U+00E9> language|koineised]] language in which the standard form unifies speakers from around the world.{{sfn|Crystal|2006}} English is used as a language of wider communication in countries around the world.{{sfn|Brutt-Griffler|2006}} Thus English has grown in worldwide use much more than any [[constructed language]] proposed as an [[international auxiliary language]], including [[Esperanto]].{{sfn|Li|2003}}{{sfn|Meierkord|2006|p=163}}

==Phonology==
{{Main|English phonology}}
The [[phonetics]] and [[phonology]] of English differ between dialects, usually without interfering with mutual communication. Phonological variation affects the inventory of [[phoneme]]s (speech sounds that distinguish meaning), and phonetic variation is differences in pronunciation of the phonemes.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|pp=334<U+2013>335}} This overview mainly describes the [[standard language|standard pronunciations]] of the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]]: [[Received Pronunciation]] (RP) and [[General American]] (GA) (See [[English language#Dialects.2C accents.2C and varieties|Section below on "Dialects, accents and varieties"]]). The phonetic symbols used below are from the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] (IPA).{{sfn|Carr|Honeybone|2007}}{{sfn|Berm<U+00FA>dez-Otero|McMahon|2006}}{{sfn|MacMahon|2006}}

In the table, when [[obstruent]]s (stops, affricates, and fricatives) appear in pairs, such as {{IPA|/p b/}}, {{IPA|/t<U+0283> d<U+0292>/}}, and {{IPA|/s z/}}, the first is [[fortis and lenis|fortis]] (strong) and the second is lenis (weak). Fortis obstruents, such as {{IPA|/p t<U+0283> s/}} are pronounced with more muscular tension and breath force than lenis consonants, such as {{IPA|/b d<U+0292> z/}}, and are always [[voicelessness|voiceless]]. Lenis consonants are partly [[voice (phonetics)|voiced]] at the beginning and end of utterances, and fully voiced between vowels. Fortis stops such as {{IPA|/p/}} have additional articulatory or acoustic features in most dialects: they are [[aspirated consonant|aspirated]] {{IPA|[p<U+02B0>]}} when they occur alone at the beginning of a stressed syllable, often unaspirated in other cases, and often unreleased {{IPA|[p<U+031A>&nbsp;]}} or pre-glottalised {{IPA|[<U+02C0>p]}} at the end of a syllable. In a single-syllable word, a vowel before a fortis stop is shortened: thus ''nip'' has a noticeably shorter vowel (phonetically, but not phonemically) than ''nib'' {{IPA|[n<U+026A><U+02D1>p<U+032C>]}} ([[#Vowels|see below]]).{{sfn|Collins|Mees|2003|pages=47<U+2013>53}}
* lenis stops: ''bin'' {{IPA|[b<U+0325><U+026A><U+02D1>n]}}, ''about'' {{IPA|[<U+0259><U+02C8>ba<U+028A>t]}}, ''nib'' {{IPA|[n<U+026A><U+02D1>b<U+0325>]}}
* fortis stops: ''pin'' {{IPA|[<U+02C8>p<U+02B0><U+026A>n]}}, ''spin'' {{IPA|[sp<U+026A>n]}}, ''happy'' {{IPA|[<U+02C8>h<U+00E6>pi]}}, ''nip'' {{IPA|[<U+02C8>nip<U+031A>&nbsp;]}} or {{IPA|[<U+02C8>ni<U+02C0>p]}}

In RP, the lateral approximant {{IPA|/l/}}, has two main [[allophone]]s (pronunciation variants): the clear or plain {{IPA|[l]}}, as in ''light'', and the dark or [[Alveolar lateral approximant#Velarized alveolar lateral approximant|velarised]] {{IPA|[<U+026B>]}}, as in ''full''.{{Sfn|Trudgill|Hannah|2008|p=13}} GA has dark ''l'' in most cases.{{Sfn|Trudgill|Hannah|2008|p=41}}
* clear ''l'': RP ''light'' {{IPA|[la<U+026A>t]}}
* dark ''l'': RP and GA ''full'' {{IPA|[f<U+028A><U+026B>]}}, GA ''light'' {{IPA|[<U+026B>a<U+026A>t]}}

All [[sonorant]]s (liquids {{IPA|/l, r/}} and nasals {{IPA|/m, n, <U+014B>/}}) devoice when following a voiceless obstruent, and they are syllabic when following a consonant at the end of a word.{{sfn|Brinton|Brinton|2010|pages=56<U+2013>59}}
* voiceless sonorants: ''clay'' {{IPA|[<U+02C8>k<U+026C><U+025B><U+026A><U+032F>]}} and ''snow'' {{IPA|[<U+02C8>sn<U+0325>o<U+028A>]}}
* syllabic sonorants: ''paddle'' {{IPA|[pad.l<U+0329>]}}, and ''button'' {{IPA|[b<U+028C>t.n<U+0329>]}}

===Vowels===
{{main|English phonology#Vowels}}
The pronunciation of vowels varies a great deal between dialects and is one of the most detectable aspects of a speaker's accent. The table below lists the vowel [[phoneme]]s in Received Pronunciation (RP) and General American (GA), with examples of words in which they occur from [[lexical set]]s compiled by linguists. The vowels are represented with symbols from the International Phonetic Alphabet; those given for RP are standard in British dictionaries and other publications.

In RP, vowel length is phonemic; [[vowel length|long vowels]] are marked with a [[Colon (punctuation)#International Phonetic Alphabet|triangular colon]] {{angbr|{{IPA|<U+02D0>}}}} in the table above, such as the vowel of ''need'' {{IPA|[ni<U+02D0>d]}} as opposed to ''bid'' {{IPA|[b<U+026A>d]}}. GA does not have long vowels.

In both RP and GA, vowels are phonetically [[clipping (phonetics)|shortened before fortis consonants]] in the same [[syllable]], like {{IPA|/t t<U+0283> f/}}, but not before lenis consonants like {{IPA|/d d<U+0292> v/}} or in open syllables: thus, the vowels of ''rich'' {{IPA|[r<U+026A><U+0306>t<U+0283>]}}, ''neat'' {{IPA|[ni<U+02D1>t]}}, and ''safe'' {{IPA|[s<U+0115><U+026A><U+0306>f]}} are noticeably shorter than the vowels of ''ridge'' {{IPA|[r<U+026A>d<U+0292>]}}, ''need'' {{IPA|[ni<U+02D0>d]}}, and ''save'' {{IPA|[se<U+026A>v]}}, and the vowel of ''light'' {{IPA|[l<U+0103><U+026A><U+0306>t]}} is shorter than that of ''lie'' {{IPA|[la<U+026A>]}}. Because lenis consonants are frequently voiceless at the end of a syllable, vowel length is an important cue as to whether the following consonant is lenis or fortis.{{sfn|Collins|Mees|2003|pp=46<U+2013>50}}

The vowels {{IPA|/<U+0268> <U+0259>/}} only occur in unstressed syllables and are a result of [[vowel reduction]]. Some dialects do not distinguish them, so that ''roses'' and ''comma'' end in the same vowel, a dialect feature called [[Phonological history of English high front vowels#Weak-vowel merger|weak vowel merger]]. GA has an unstressed ''r''-coloured schwa {{IPA|/<U+025A>/}}, as in ''butter'' {{IPA|[<U+02C8>b<U+028C>t<U+025A>]}}, which in RP has the same vowel as the word-final vowel in ''comma''.

===Phonotactics===
An English syllable includes a syllable nucleus consisting of a vowel sound. Syllable onset and coda (start and end) are optional. A syllable can start with up to three consonant sounds, as in ''sprint'' {{IPA|/spr<U+026A>nt/}}, and end with up to four, as in ''texts'' {{IPA|/teksts/}}. This gives an English syllable the following structure, (CCC)V(CCCC) where C represents a consonant and V a vowel. The consonants that may appear together in onsets or codas are restricted, as is the order in which they may appear. Onsets can only have four types of consonant clusters: a stop and approximant, as in ''play''; a voiceless fricative and approximant, as in ''fly'' or ''sly''; ''s'' and a voiceless stop, as in ''stay''; and ''s'', a voiceless stop, and an approximant, as in ''string''.{{sfn|Brinton|Brinton|2010|page=60}} Clusters of nasal and stop are only allowed in codas. Clusters of obstruents always agree in voicing, and clusters of sibilants and of plosives with the same point of articulation are prohibited. Furthermore, several consonants have limited distributions: {{IPA|/h/}} can only occur in syllable initial position, and {{IPA|/<U+014B>/}} only in syllable final position.{{sfn|K<U+00F6>nig|1994|pages=537<U+2013>538}}

===Stress, rhythm and intonation===
{{see also|Stress and vowel reduction in English|Intonation in English}}
[[stress (linguistics)|Stress]] plays an important role in English. Certain [[syllable]]s are stressed, while others are unstressed. Stress is a combination of duration, intensity, vowel quality, and sometimes changes in pitch. Stressed syllables are pronounced longer and louder than unstressed syllables, and vowels in unstressed syllables are frequently [[vowel reduction|reduced]] while vowels in stressed syllables are not.{{sfn|International Phonetic Association|1999|page=42}} Some words, primarily short function words but also some modal verbs such as ''can'', have [[Stress and vowel reduction in English#Weak and strong forms of words|weak and strong forms]] depending on whether they occur in stressed or non-stressed position within a sentence.

Stress in English is [[phoneme|phonemic]], and some pairs of words are distinguished by stress. For instance, the word ''contract'' is stressed on the first syllable ({{IPAc-en|<U+02C8>|k|<U+0252>|n|t|r|<U+00E6>|k|t}} {{respell|KON|trakt}}) when used as a noun, but on the last syllable ({{IPAc-en|k|<U+0259>|n|<U+02C8>|t|r|<U+00E6>|k|t}} {{respell|k<U+0259>n|TRAKT|'}}) for most meanings (for example, "reduce in size") when used as a verb.{{sfn|OxfordLearner'sDictionary|2015|loc=Entry "contract"}}{{sfn|MerriamWebster|2015|loc=Entry "contract"}}{{sfn|MacquarieDictionary|2015|loc=Entry "contract"}} Here stress is connected to [[vowel reduction]]: in the noun "contract" the first syllable is stressed and has the unreduced vowel {{IPA|/<U+0252>/}}, but in the verb "contract" the first syllable is unstressed and its vowel is reduced to {{IPA|/<U+0259>/}}. Stress is also used to distinguish between words and phrases, so that a compound word receives a single stress unit, but the corresponding phrase has two: e.g. ''to b<U+00FA>rn <U+00F3>ut'' versus ''a b<U+00FA>rnout'', and ''a h<U+00F3>tdog''  versus ''a h<U+00F3>t d<U+00F3>g''.{{sfn|Brinton|Brinton|2010|page=66}}

In terms of [[rhythm]], English is generally described as a [[Isochrony#Stress-timing|stress-timed]] language, meaning that the amount of time between stressed syllables tends to be equal. Stressed syllables are pronounced longer, but unstressed syllables (syllables between stresses) are shortened. Vowels in unstressed syllables are shortened as well, and vowel shortening causes changes in [[Vowel#Articulation|vowel quality]]: [[vowel reduction]].

Varieties of English vary the most in pronunciation of vowels, and are categorised generally into two groups: British (BrE) and American (AmE). Because North America was settled in the late 17th century, [[American English|American]] and [[Canadian English]] had time to diverge greatly from other varieties of English during centuries when transoceanic travel was slow. [[Australian English|Australian]], [[New Zealand English|New Zealand]], and [[South African English]], on the other hand, were settled in the 19th century, shortly before ocean-going steamships became commonplace, so they show close similarities to the [[English in southern England|English of South East England]]. The [[Hiberno-English|English spoken in Ireland]] and [[Scottish English]] fall between these two groups. Some differences between the various dialects are shown in the table "Varieties of Standard English and their features".{{sfn|Trudgill|Hannah|2002|pp=4<U+2013>6}}

English has undergone many [[Phonological history of English|historical sound changes]], some of them affecting all varieties, and others affecting only a few. Most standard varieties are affected by the [[Great Vowel Shift]], which changed the pronunciation of long vowels, but a few dialects have slightly different results. In North America, a number of chain shifts such as the [[Northern Cities Vowel Shift]] and [[Canadian Shift]] have produced very different vowel landscapes in some regional accents.

Some dialects have fewer or more consonant phonemes and [[phone (phonetics)|phones]] than the standard varieties. Some conservative varieties like Scottish English have a [[voicelessness|voiceless]] {{IPAblink|<U+028D>}} sound in ''whine'' that contrasts with the voiced {{IPA|[w]}} in ''wine'', but most other dialects pronounce both words with voiced {{IPA|[w]}}, a dialect feature called [[Phonological history of wh#Wine<U+2013>whine merger|''wine''<U+2013>''whine'' merger]]. The unvoiced velar fricative sound {{IPA|/x/}} is found in Scottish English, which distinguishes ''loch'' {{IPA|/l<U+0254>x/}} from ''lock'' {{IPA|/l<U+0254>k/}}. Accents like [[Cockney]] with "''h''-dropping" lack the glottal fricative {{IPA|/h/}}, and dialects with [[th-stopping|''th''-stopping]] and [[th-fronting|''th''-fronting]] like [[African American Vernacular English|African American Vernacular]] and [[Estuary English]] do not have the dental fricatives {{IPA|/<U+03B8>, <U+00F0>/}}, but replace them with dental or alveolar stops {{IPA|/t, d/}} or labiodental fricatives {{IPA|/f, v/}}.{{sfn|Roach|2009|p=53}}{{sfn|Giegerich|1992|page=36}} Other changes affecting the phonology of local varieties are processes such as [[Phonological history of English consonant clusters#Yod-dropping|''yod''-dropping]], [[Phonological history of English consonant clusters#Yod-coalescence|yod-coalescence]], and reduction of consonant clusters.

[[General American]] and [[Received Pronunciation]] vary in their pronunciation of historical {{IPA|/r/}} after a vowel at the end of a syllable (in the [[Syllable#Coda|syllable coda]]). GA is a [[rhotic and non-rhotic accents|rhotic dialect]], meaning that it pronounces {{IPA|/r/}} at the end of a syllable, but RP is non-rhotic, meaning that it loses {{IPA|/r/}} in that position. English dialects are classified as rhotic or non-rhotic depending on whether they elide {{IPA|/r/}} like RP or keep it like GA.{{sfn|Lass|2000|p=114}}

There is complex dialectal variation in words with the [[Phonological history of English short A|open front]] and [[Phonological history of English low back vowels|open back vowels]] {{IPA|/<U+00E6> <U+0251><U+02D0> <U+0252> <U+0254><U+02D0>/}}. These four vowels are only distinguished in RP, Australia, and New Zealand. In GA, these vowels merge to three {{IPA|/<U+00E6> <U+0251> <U+0254>/}},{{sfn|Wells|1982|pages=xviii-xix}} and in Canadian English they merge to two {{IPA|/<U+00E6> <U+0251>/}}.{{sfn|Wells|1982|page=493}} In addition, the words that have each vowel vary by dialect. The table "Dialects and open vowels" shows this variation with [[lexical set]]s in which these sounds occur.

==Grammar==
{{Main|English grammar}}
Modern English grammar is the result of a gradual change from a typical Indo-European dependent marking pattern with a rich [[inflection]]al morphology and relatively free word order, to a mostly [[Analytic language|analytic]] pattern with little inflection, a fairly fixed [[SVO word order]] and a complex syntax.{{sfn|K<U+00F6>nig|1994|page=539}} Some traits typical of Germanic languages persist in English, such as the distinction between irregularly inflected [[strong inflection|strong]] stems inflected through [[ablaut]] (i.e. changing the vowel of the stem, as in the pairs ''speak/spoke'' and ''foot/feet'') and weak stems inflected through affixation (such as ''love/loved'', ''hand/hands''). Vestiges of the case and gender system are found in the pronoun system (''he/him, who/whom'') and in the inflection of the copula verb ''to be''. Typically for an Indo-European language, English follows [[Nominative<U+2013>accusative language|accusative]] [[morphosyntactic alignment]]. English distinguishes at least seven major word classes: verbs, nouns, adjectives, adverbs, determiners (i.e. articles), prepositions, and conjunctions. Some analyses add pronouns as a class separate from nouns, and subdivide conjunctions into subordinators and coordinators, and add the class of interjections.{{sfn|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|page=22}} English also has a rich set of auxiliary verbs, such as ''have'' and ''do'', expressing the categories of mood and aspect. Questions are marked by [[do-support]], [[wh-movement]] (fronting of question words beginning with ''wh''-) and word order [[Subject<U+2013>auxiliary inversion|inversion]] with some verbs.

The seven word classes are exemplified in this sample sentence:{{sfb|Aarts|Haegeman|2006|page=118}}
{| style="text-align: center;"
| ''The'' || ''chairman'' || ''of'' || ''the'' || ''committee'' || ''and'' || ''the'' || ''loquacious'' || ''politician'' || ''clashed'' || ''violently'' || ''when'' || ''the'' || ''meeting'' || ''started''
|-
| Det. || Noun || Prep. || Det. || Noun || Conj. || Det. || Adj. || Noun || Verb || Advb. || Conj. || Det. || Noun || Verb
|}

===Nouns and noun phrases===
English nouns are only inflected for number and possession. New nouns can be formed through derivation or compounding. They are semantically divided into [[proper nouns]] (names) and common nouns. Common nouns are in turn divided into concrete and abstract nouns, and grammatically into [[count noun]]s and [[mass nouns]].{{sfn|Payne|Huddleston|2002}}

Most count nouns are inflected for plural number through the use of the plural [[suffix]] -''s'', but a few nouns have irregular plural forms. Mass nouns can only be pluralised through the use of a count noun classifier, e.g. ''one loaf of bread'', ''two loaves of bread''.{{sfn|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|page=56<U+2013>57}}

Regular Plural formation:
:Singular: ''cat, dog''
:Plural: ''cats, dogs''

Irregular plural formation:
:Singular: ''man, woman, foot, fish, ox, knife, mouse''
:Plural: ''men, women, feet, fish, oxen, knives, mice''

Possession can be expressed either by the possessive [[enclitic]] -''s'' (also traditionally called a genitive suffix), or by the preposition ''of''. Historically the -s possessive has been used for animate nouns, whereas the ''of'' possessive has been reserved for inanimate nouns. Today this distinction is less clear, and many speakers use -''s'' also with inanimates. Orthographically the possessive -s is separated from the noun root with an apostrophe.

Possessive constructions:
:With -s: ''The woman's husband's child''
:With of: ''The child of the husband of the woman''

Nouns can form [[noun phrase]]s (NPs) where they are the syntactic head of the words that depend on them such as determiners, quantifiers, conjunctions or adjectives.{{sfn|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|page=55}} Noun phrases can be short, such as ''the man'', composed only of a determiner and a noun. They can also include modifiers such as adjectives (e.g. ''red'', ''tall'', ''all'') and specifiers such as determiners (e.g. ''the'', ''that''). But they can also tie together several nouns into a single long NP, using conjunctions such as ''and'', or prepositions such as ''with'', e.g. ''the tall man with the long red trousers and his skinny wife with the spectacles'' (this NP uses conjunctions, prepositions, specifiers and modifiers). Regardless of length, an NP functions as a syntactic unit. For example the possessive enclitic can, in cases which do not lead to ambiguity, follow the entire noun phrase, as in ''The President of India's wife'', where the enclitic follows ''India'' and not ''President''.

The class of determiners is used to specify the noun they precede in terms of [[definiteness]], where ''the'' marks a definite noun and ''a'' or ''an'' an indefinite one. A definite noun is assumed by the speaker to be already known by the interlocutor, whereas an indefinite noun is not specified as being previously known. Quantifiers, which include ''one'', ''many'', ''some'' and ''all'', are used to specify the noun in terms of quantity or number. The noun must agree with the number of the determiner, e.g. ''one man'' (sg.) but ''all men'' (pl.).  Determiners are the first constituents in a noun phrase.{{sfn|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|pages=54<U+2013>5}}

====Adjectives====
Adjectives modify a noun by providing additional information about their referents. In English, adjectives come before the nouns they modify and after determiners.{{sfn|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|page=57}} In Modern English, adjectives are not inflected, and they do not they do not [[agreement (linguistics)|agree]] in form with the noun they modify, as adjectives in most other Indo-European languages do. For example, in the phrases ''the slender boy'', and ''many slender girls'', the adjective ''slender'' does not change form to agree with either the number or gender of the noun.

Some adjectives are inflected for [[comparison (grammar)|degree of comparison]], with the positive degree unmarked, the suffix ''-er'' marking the comparative, and ''-est'' marking the superlative: ''a small boy'', ''the boy is smaller than the girl'', ''that boy is the smallest''. Some adjectives have irregular comparative and superlative forms, such as ''good'', ''better'', and ''best''. Other adjectives have comparatives formed by [[periphrasis|periphrastic constructions]], with the adverb ''more'' marking the comparative, and ''most'' marking the superlative: ''happier'' or ''more happy'', ''the happiest'' or ''most happy''.{{sfn|K<U+00F6>nig|1994|page=540}} There is some variation among speakers regarding which adjectives use inflected or periphrastic comparison, and some studies have shown a tendency for the periphrastic forms to become more common at the expense of the inflected form.{{sfn|Mair|2006|pages=148<U+2013>49}}

====Pronouns, case and person====
English pronouns conserve many traits of case and gender inflection. The personal pronouns retain a difference between subjective and objective case in most persons (''I/me, he/him, she/her, we/us, they/them'') as well as a gender and animateness distinction in the third person singular (distinguishing ''he/she/it''). The [[subjective case]] corresponds to the Old English [[nominative case]], and the [[objective case]] is used both in the sense of the previous [[accusative case]] (in the role of patient, or direct object of a transitive verb), and in the sense of the Old English dative case (in the role of a recipient or [[indirect object]] of a transitive verb).{{sfn|Leech|2006|page=69|quote="Nominative is a traditional name for the subjective case"}}{{sfn|O'Dwyer|2006|quote="English has subjective, objective and possessive cases."}} Subjective case is used when the pronoun is the subject of a finite clause, and otherwise the objective case is used.{{sfn|Greenbaum|Nelson|2002}} While already grammarians such as [[Henry Sweet]]{{sfn|Sweet|2014|page=52|quote=But in that special class of nouns called personal pronouns we find a totally different system of case-inflection, namely, a '''nominative''' case (he) and an '''objective''' case (him)}} and [[Otto Jespersen]]{{sfn|Jespersen|2007|173=185}} noted that the English cases did not correspond to the traditional Latin based system, some contemporary grammars, for example {{harvcoltxt|Huddleston|Pullum|2002}}, retain traditional labels for the cases, calling them nominative and accusative cases respectively.

Possessive pronouns exist in dependent and independent forms; the dependent form functions as a determiner specifying a noun (as in ''my chair''), while the independent form can stand alone as if it were a noun (e.g. ''the chair is mine'').{{sfn|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|page=425<U+2013>26}} The English system of grammatical person no longer has a distinction between formal and informal pronouns of address, and the forms for 2nd person plural and singular are identical except in the reflexive form. Some dialects have introduced innovative 2nd person plural pronouns such as ''y'all'' found in Southern American English and African American Vernacular English or ''youse'' and ''ye'' found in Irish English.

Pronouns are used to refer to entities deictically or anaphorically. A deictic pronoun points to some person or object by identifying it relative to the speech situation - for example the pronoun ''I'' identifies the speaker, and the pronoun ''you'', the addressee. Anaphorical pronouns such as ''that'' refer back to an entity already mentioned or assumed by the speaker to be known by the audience, for example in the sentences ''I already told you that'', or ''I told Mike I don't want to see him here anymore''. The reflexive pronouns are used when the oblique argument is identical to the subject of a phrase (e.g. "he sent it to himself" or "she braced herself for impact").{{sfn|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|page=426}}

====Prepositions====
Prepositional phrases (PP) are phrases composed of a preposition and one or more nouns, e.g. ''with the dog'', ''for my friend'', ''to school'', ''in England''. Prepositions have a wide range of uses in English. They are used to describing movement, place, and other relations between different entities, but they also have many syntactic uses such as introducing complement clauses and oblique arguments of verbs. For example in the phrase ''I gave it to him'', the preposition ''to'' marks the recipient, or Indirect Object of the verb ''to give''. Traditionally words were only considered prepositions if they governed the case of the noun they preceded, for example causing the pronouns to use the objective rather than subjective form, "with her", "to me", "for us". But some contemporary grammars such as {{harvcoltxt|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|pp=598<U+2013>600}} no longer consider government and case to be defining for the class of prepositions, rather defining prepositions as words that can function as the heads of prepositional phrases.

===Verbs and verb phrases===
English verbs are inflected for tense and aspect, and marked for agreement with third person singular subject. Only the copula verb ''to be'' is still inflected for agreement with the plural and first and second person subjects.{{sfn|K<U+00F6>nig|1994|page=540}} Auxiliary verbs such as ''have'' and ''be'' are paired with verbs in the infinitive, past, or progressive forms. They form [[periphrasis|complex]] tenses, aspects, and moods. Auxiliary verbs differ from other verbs in that they can be followed by the negation, and in that they can occur as the first constituent in a question sentence.{{sfn|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|page=51}}{{sfn|K<U+00F6>nig|1994|page=541}}

Most verbs have six inflectional forms. The primary forms are a plain present, a third person singular present, and a preterit (past) form. The secondary forms are a plain form used for the infinitive, a gerund<U+2013>participle and a past participle.{{sfn|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|page=50}} The copula verb ''to be'' s the only verb to retain some of its original conjugation, and takes different inflectional forms depending on the subject. The first person present tense form is ''am'', the third person singular form ''is'' and the form ''are'' is used second person singular and all three plurals. The only verb past participle is ''been'' and its gerund-participle is ''being''.

====Tense, aspect and mood====
English has two primary tenses, past (preterit) and non-past. The preterit is inflected by using the preterit form of the verb, which for the regular verbs includes the suffix ''-ed'', and for the strong verbs either the suffix ''-t'' or a change in the stem vowel. The non-past form is unmarked except in the third person singular, which takes the suffix ''-s''.{{sfn|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|page=51}}

English does not have a grammaticalised future tense.{{sfn|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|pages=208<U+2013>210}} Futurity of action is expressed periphrastically with one of the auxiliary verbs ''will'' or ''shall''.{{sfn|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|page=51<U+2013>52}} Many varieties also use a near future constructed with the phrasal verb ''be going to''.{{sfn|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|pages=210<U+2013>11}}

Further aspectual distinctions are encoded by the use of auxiliary verbs, primarily ''have'' and ''be'', which encode the contrast between a perfect and non-perfect past tense (''I have run'' vs. ''I was running''), and compound tenses such as preterite perfect (''I had been running'') and present perfect (''I have been running'').{{sfn|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|page=50<U+2013>51}}

For the expression of mood, English uses a number of modal auxiliaries, such as ''can'', ''may'', ''will'', ''shall'' and the past tense forms ''could'', ''might'', ''would'', ''should''. There is also a subjunctive and an imperative mood, both based on the plain form of the verb (i.e. without the third person singular ''-s''), and which is used in subordinate clauses (e.g. subjunctive: ''It is important that he run every day''; imperative ''Run!'').{{sfn|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|page=51<U+2013>52}}

An infinitive form, that uses the plain form of the verb and the preposition ''to'', is used for verbal clauses that are syntactically subordinate to a finite verbal clause. Finite verbal clauses are those that are formed around a verb in the present or preterit form. In clauses with auxiliary verbs they are the finite verbs and the main verb is treated as a subordinate clause. For example ''he has to go'' where only the auxiliary verb ''have'' is inflected for time and the main verb ''to go'' is in the infinitive, or in a complement clause such as ''I saw him leave'', where the main verb is ''to see'' which is in a preterite form, and ''leave'' is in the infinitive.

====Phrasal verbs====
English also makes frequent use of constructions traditionally called [[phrasal verb]]s, verb phrases that are made up of a verb root and a preposition or particle which follows the verb. The phrase then functions as a single predicate. In terms of intonation the preposition is fused to the verb, but in writing it is written as a separate word. Examples of phrasal verbs are ''to get up'', ''to ask out'', ''to back up'', ''to give up'', ''to get together'', ''to hang out'', ''to put up with'', etc. The phrasal verb frequently has a highly idiomatic meaning that is more specialised and restricted than what can be simply extrapolated from the combination of verb and preposition complement (e.g. ''lay off'' meaning ''terminate someone's employment'').{{sfn|Dixon|1982}} In spite of the idiomatic meaning, some grammarians, including {{harvcoltxt|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|page=274}}, do not consider this type of construction to form a syntactic constituent and hence refrain from using the term "phrasal verb". Instead they consider the construction simply to be a verb with a prepositional phrase as its syntactic complement, i.e. ''he woke up in the morning'' and ''he ran up in the mountains'' are syntactically equivalent.

====Adverbs====
The function of adverbs is to modify the action or event described by the verb by providing additional information about the manner in which it occurs. Many adverbs are derived from adjectives with the suffix ''-ly'', but not all, and many speakers tend to omit the suffix in the most commonly used adverbs. For example in the phrase ''the woman walked quickly'' the adverb ''quickly'' derived from the adjective ''quick'' describes the woman's way of walking. Some commonly used adjectives have irregular adverbial forms, such as ''good'' which has the adverbial form ''well''.

===Syntax===
[[File:Constituent structure analysis English sentence.svg|upright=1.5|thumb|In the English sentence ''The cat sat on the mat'' the subject is ''the cat'' (a NP), the verb is ''sat'', and ''on the mat'' is a prepositional phrase (composed of an NP ''the mat'', and headed by the preposition ''on''). The tree describes the structure of the sentence.]]

Modern English syntax language is moderately [[Isolating language|analytic]].{{sfn|McArthur|1992|pp=64, 610<U+2013>611}} It has developed features such as [[English modal verb|modal verbs]] and [[word order]] as resources for conveying meaning. [[Auxiliary verb]]s mark constructions such as questions, negative polarity, the [[Grammatical voice|passive voice]] and progressive [[grammatical aspect|aspect]].

====Basic constituent order====
English word order has moved from the Germanic [[V2 word order|verb-second (V2) word order]] to being almost exclusively [[subject<U+2013>verb<U+2013>object]] (SVO).{{sfn|K<U+00F6>nig|1994|page=553}} The combination of SVO order and use of auxiliary verbs often creates clusters of two or more verbs at the centre of the sentence, such as ''he had hoped to try to open it''.

In most sentences English only marks grammatical relations through word order.{{sfn|K<U+00F6>nig|1994|page=550}} The subject constituent precedes the verb and the object constituent follows it. The example below demonstrates how the grammatical roles of each constituent is marked only by the position relative to the verb:

{| style="text-align: center;"
| ''The dog'' || ''bites'' || ''the man''
|-
| S || V || O
|-
| ''The man'' || ''bites'' || ''the dog''
|-
| S || V || O
|}

An exception is found in sentences where one of the constituents is a pronoun, in which case it is doubly marked, both by word order and by case inflection, where the subject pronoun precedes the verb and takes the subjective case form, and the object pronoun follows the verb and takes the objective case form. The example below demonstrates this double marking in a sentence where both object and subject is represented with a third person singular masculine pronoun:

{| style="text-align: center;"
| ''He'' || ''hit'' || ''him''
|-
| S || V || O
|}

[[Indirect object]]s (IO) of ditransitive verbs can be placed either as the first object in a double object construction (S V IO O), such as ''I gave <u>Jane</u> the book'' or in a prepositional phrase, such as ''I gave the book <u>to Jane</u>'' {{sfn|K<U+00F6>nig|1994|page=551}}

====Clause syntax====
{{main|English clause syntax}}
In English a sentence may be composed of one or more clauses, that may in turn be composed of one or more phrases (e.g. Noun Phrases, Verb Phrases, and Prepositional Phrases). A clause is built around a verb, and includes its constituents, such as any NPs and PPs. Within a sentence one clause is always the main clause (or matrix clause) whereas other clauses are subordinate to it. Subordinate clauses may function as arguments of the verb in the main clause. For example in the phrase ''I think (that) you are lying'', the main clause is headed by the verb ''think'', the subject is ''I'', but the object of the phrase is the subordinate clause ''(that) you are lying''. The subordinating conjunction ''that'' shows that the clause that follows is a subordinate clause, but it is often omitted.{{sfn|Miller|2002|pages=60<U+2013>69}} [[Relative clause]]s are clauses that function as a modifier or specifier to some constituent in the main clause: For example in the sentence ''I saw the letter that you received today'', the relative clause ''that you received today'' specifies the meaning of the word ''letter'', the object of the main clause. Relative clauses can be introduced by the pronouns ''who'', ''whose'', ''whom'' and ''which'' as well as by ''that'' (which can also be omitted.){{sfn|K<U+00F6>nig|1994|page=545}} In contrast to many other Germanic languages there is no major differences between word order in main and subordinate clauses.{{sfn|K<U+00F6>nig|1994|page=557}}

====Auxiliary verb constructions====
{{main|Do-support|Subject<U+2013>auxiliary inversion}}

English syntax relies on auxiliary verbs for many functions including the expression of tense, aspect and mood. Auxiliary verbs form main clauses, and the main verbs function as heads of a subordinate clause of the auxiliary verb. For example in the sentence ''the dog did not find its bone'', the clause ''find its bone'' is the complement of the negated verb ''did not''. [[Subject<U+2013>auxiliary inversion]] is used in many constructions, including focus, negation, and interrogative constructions.

The verb ''do'' can be used as an auxiliary even in simple declarative sentences, where it usually serves to add emphasis, as in "I ''did'' shut the fridge." However in the negated and inverted clauses referred to above, it is used because the rules of English [[syntax]] permit these constructions only when an auxiliary is present. [[Modern English]] does not allow the addition of the negating adverb ''not'' to an ordinary [[finite verb|finite]] lexical verb, as in ''*I know not'' <U+2013> it can only be added to an auxiliary (or [[copular verb|copular]]) verb, hence if there is no other auxiliary present when negation is required, the auxiliary ''do'' is used, to produce a form like ''I do not (don't) know.'' The same applies in clauses requiring inversion, including most questions <U+2013> inversion must involve the subject and an auxiliary verb, so it is not possible to say ''*Know you him?''; grammatical rules require ''Do you know him?''{{sfn|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|page=114}}

Negation is done with the adverb ''not'', which precedes the main verb and follows an auxiliary verb. A contracted form of not ''-n't'' can be used as an enclitic attaching to auxiliary verbs and to the copula verb ''to be''. Just as with questions, many negative constructions require the negation to occur with do-support, thus in Modern English ''I don't know him'' is the correct answer to the question ''Do you know him?'', but not ''*I know him not'', although this construction may be found in older English.{{sfn|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|pages=786<U+2013>790}}

Passive constructions also use auxiliary verbs. A passive construction rephrases an active construction in such a way that the object of the active phrase becomes the subject of the passive phrase, and the subject of the active phrase is either omitted or demoted to a role as an oblique argument introduced in a prepositional phrase. They are formed by using the past participle either with the auxiliary verb ''to be'' or ''to get'', although not all varieties of English allow the use of passives with ''get''. For example putting the sentence ''she sees him'' into the passive becomes ''he is seen (by her)'', or ''he gets seen (by her)''.{{sfn|Miller|2002|pages=26<U+2013>27}}

====Questions====
In English questions can be formed either with do-support (''do you know her?'') or with the interrogative pronouns (e.g. ''what, who, where, when, why''). In most constructions interrogative pronouns occur in a [[Wh-movement|fronted position]] before the subject-verb compound, regardless of their grammatical role in the sentence. For example in the sentence ''what did you see'', ''what'' refers to the grammatical object of the sentence but nonetheless occurs as the sentence's first constituent. Also prepositional phrases can be fronted when they are the theme of the question, e.g. ''where did you go last night?''. The personal interrogative pronoun ''who'' is the only one of the interrogative pronouns to still show inflection for case, with the variant ''whom'' serving as the objective case form, although this form is no longer in use by many speakers. For those speaker who do use it, it distinguishes between questions where the theme of the question is the grammatical subject of the verb, from those where it is the object or another grammatical role that is being questioned. E.g. ''who saw you?'', but ''whom did you see?''

====Discourse level syntax====
At the discourse level English tends to use a [[topic-comment]] structure, where the known information (topic) precedes the new information (comment). Because of the strict SVO syntax, the topic of a sentence generally has to be the grammatical subject of the sentence. In cases where the topic is not the grammatical subject of the sentence, frequently the topic is promoted to subject position through syntactic means. One way of doing this is through a passive construction, ''the girl was stung by the bee''. Another way is through a [[cleft sentence]] where the main clause is demoted to be a complement clause of a copula sentence with a [[dummy subject]] such as ''it'' or ''there'', e.g. ''it was the girl that the bee stung'', ''there was a girl who was stung by a bee''.{{sfn|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|pages=1365<U+2013>70}} Dummy subjects are also used in constructions where there is no grammatical subject such as with impersonal verbs (e.g., ''it is raining'') or in existential clauses (''there are many cars on the street''). Through the use of these complex sentence constructions with informationally vacuous subjects, English is able to maintain both a topic comment sentence structure and a SVO syntax.

[[Focus (linguistics)|Focus constructions]] emphasise a particular piece of new or salient information within a sentence, generally through allocating the main sentence level stress on the focal constituent. For example, ''the girl was stung by <u>a bee</u>'' (emphasising it was a bee and not for example a wasp that stung her), or ''<u>The girl</u> was stung by a bee'' (contrasting with another possibility, for example that it was the boy).{{sfn|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|page=1370}} Topic and focus can also be established through syntactic dislocation, either preposing or postposing the item to be focused on relative to the main clause. For example ''That girl over there, she was stung by a bee'', emphasises the girl by preposition, but a similar effect could be achieved by postposition, ''she was stung by a bee, that girl over there'', where reference to the girl is established as an "afterthought".{{sfn|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|page=1366}}

[[Cohesion (linguistics)|Cohesion]] between sentences is achieved through the use of deictic pronouns as [[anaphora]] (e.g. ''that is exactly what I mean'' where ''that'' refers to some fact known to both interlocutors, or ''then'' used to locate the time of a narrated event relative to the time of a previously narrated event).{{sfn|Halliday|Hasan|1976}} [[Discourse marker]]s such as ''oh'', ''so'' or ''well'', also signal the progression of ideas between sentences and help to create cohesion. Discourse markers are often the first constituents in sentences. Discourse markers are also used for [[Stance (linguistics)|stance taking]] in which speakers position themselves in a specific attitude towards what is being said, for example, ''no way is that true!'' (the idiomatic marker ''no way!'' expressing disbelief), or ''boy! I'm hungry'' (the marker ''boy'' expressing emphasis). While discourse markers are particularly characteristic of informal and spoken registers of English, they are also used in written and formal registers.{{sfn|Schiffrin|1988}}

==Vocabulary==

The vocabulary of English is vast, and counting exactly how many words English (or any language) has is impossible.{{sfn|HowManyWords|2015}}{{sfn|Sheidlower|2006}}{{sfn|Algeo|1999}} The two largest dictionaries of the English language overlap with each other very little, so the vocabulary of English must be even larger than the count of words in the most complete available English dictionary.{{sfn|Crystal|2003b|p=119}} Early studies of English vocabulary by [[Lexicography|lexicographers]], the scholars who formally study vocabulary, compile dictionaries, or both, were impeded by a lack of comprehensive data on actual vocabulary in use from good-quality [[Corpus linguistics|linguistic corpora]],{{sfn|Leech|Hundt|Mair|Smith|2009|pp=24<U+2013>50}} collections of actual written texts and spoken passages. Many statements published before the end of the 20th century about the growth of English vocabulary over time, the dates of first use of various words in English, and the sources of English vocabulary will have to be corrected as new computerized analysis of linguistic corpus data becomes available.{{sfn|Algeo|1999}}{{sfn|Kastovsky|2006}}

===Word formation processes===
English forms new words from existing words or roots in its vocabulary through a variety of processes. One of the most productive processes in English is conversion,{{sfn|Crystal|2003b|p=129}} using a word with a different grammatical role, for example using a noun as a verb or a verb as a noun. Another productive word-formation process is nominal compounding,{{sfn|Algeo|1999}}{{sfn|Kastovsky|2006}} producing compound words such as ''babysitter'' or ''ice cream'' or ''homesick''.{{sfn|Crystal|2003b|p=129}} A process more common in Old English than in Modern English, but still productive in Modern English, is the use of derivational suffixes (''-hood'', ''-ness'', ''-ing'', ''-ility'') to derive new words from existing words (especially those of Germanic origin) or stems (especially for words of Latin or Greek origin). Formation of new words, called [[neologisms]], based on Greek or Latin roots (for example ''television'' or ''optometry'') is a highly productive process in English and in most modern European languages, so much so that it is often difficult to determine in which language a neologism first originated. For this reason, lexicographer Philip Gove attributed many such words to the "[[international scientific vocabulary]]" (ISV) when compiling [[Webster's Dictionary#Webster.27s Third New International Dictionary .281961.29|Webster's Third New International Dictionary]] (1961). Another active word-formation process in English is [[acronym]]s,{{sfn|Crystal|2003b|pp=120<U+2013>121}} words formed by pronouncing as a single word abbreviations of longer phrases (e.g. ''NATO'', ''laser'').

===Word origins===
{{Main|Lists of English loanwords by country or language of origin}}

English, besides forming new words from existing words and their roots, also borrows words from other languages. This process of adding words from other languages is commonplace in many world languages, but English is characterised as being especially open to borrowing of foreign words throughout the last 1,000 years.{{sfn|Denning|Kessler|Leben|2007|p=7}} The most commonly used words in English are West Germanic.{{sfn|Nation|2001|p=265}} The words in English learned first by children as they learn to speak, particularly the grammatical words that dominate the word count of both spoken and written texts, are the Germanic words inherited from the earliest periods of the development of Old English.{{sfn|Algeo|1999}} But one of the consequences of long language contact between French and English in all stages of their development is that the vocabulary of English has a very high percentage of "Latinate" words (derived from French, especially, and also from Latin or from other Romance languages).{{sfn|Denning|Kessler|Leben|2007}} French words from various periods of the development of French now make up one-third of the vocabulary of English.{{sfn|Gottlieb|2006|p=196}}

English has also borrowed many words directly from Latin, the ancestor of the Romance languages, during all stages of its development.{{sfn|Kastovsky|2006}}{{sfn|Algeo|1999}} Many of the words borrowed into English from Latin were earlier borrowed into Latin from Greek.  Latin or Greek are still highly productive sources of stems used to form vocabulary of subjects learned in higher education such as the sciences, philosophy, and mathematics.{{sfn|Romaine|1999|p=4}} English continues to gain new loanwords and [[calques]] ("loan translations") from languages all over the world. English has formal and informal [[Register (sociolinguistics)|speech registers]], and informal registers, including child directed speech, tend to be made up predominantly of words of Anglo-Saxon origin, while the percentage of vocabulary that is of Latinate origin is higher in legal, scientific, and academic texts.{{sfn|Crystal|2003b|pp=124<U+2013>127}}{{sfn|Algeo|1999|pp=80<U+2013>81}}

===English loanwords and calques in other languages===

English has a strong influence on the vocabulary of other languages.{{sfn|Gottlieb|2006|p=196}}{{sfn|Brutt-Griffler|2006|p=692}} The influence of English comes from such factors as opinion leaders in other countries knowing the English language, the role of English as a world lingua franca, and the large number of books and films that are translated from English into other languages.{{sfn|Gottlieb|2006|p=197}} That pervasive use of English leads to a conclusion in many places that English is an especially suitable language for expressing new ideas or describing new technologies. Among varieties of English, it is especially American English that influences other languages.{{sfn|Gottlieb|2006|p=198}} Some languages, such as Chinese, write words borrowed from English mostly as calques, while others, such as Japanese, readily take in English loanwords written in sound-indicating script.{{sfn|Gottlieb|2006|p=202}} Dubbed films and television programmes are an especially fruitful source of English influence on languages in Europe.{{sfn|Gottlieb|2006|p=202}}

==Writing system==

{{See also|English alphabet|English braille|English orthography}}
Since the ninth century, English has been written in a [[Latin alphabet]] (also called Roman alphabet). Earlier Old English texts in [[Anglo-Saxon runes]] are only short inscriptions. The great majority of literary works in Old English that survive to today are written in the Roman alphabet.{{sfn|Gneuss|2013|p=23}} The modern English alphabet contains 26 letters of the Latin script: [[a]], [[b]], [[c]], [[d]], [[e]], [[f]], [[g]], [[h]], [[i]], [[j]], [[k]], [[l]], [[m]], [[n]], [[o]], [[p]], [[q]], [[r]], [[s]], [[t]], [[u]], [[v]], [[w]], [[x]], [[y]], [[z]] (which also have [[Letter case|capital]] forms: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

The spelling system, or [[orthography]], of English is multi-layered, with elements of French, Latin, and Greek spelling on top of the native Germanic system.{{sfn|Swan|2006|p=149}} Further complications have arisen through [[sound change]]s with which the orthography has not kept pace.{{sfn|Lass|2000}} Compared to European languages for which official organisations have promoted spelling reforms, English has spelling that is a less consistent indicator of pronunciation and standard spellings of words that are more difficult to guess from knowing how a word is pronounced.{{sfn|Mountford|2006}} There are also systematic [[American and British English spelling differences|spelling differences between British and American English]]. These situations have prompted proposals for spelling reform in English.{{sfn|Neijt|2006}}

Although letters and speech sounds do not have a one-to-one correspondence in standard English spelling, spelling rules that take into account syllable structure, phonetic changes in derived words, and word accent are reliable for most English words.{{sfn|Daniels|Bright|1996|p=653}} Moreover, standard English spelling shows etymological relationships between related words that would be obscured by a closer correspondence between pronunciation and spelling, for example the words ''photograph'', ''photography'', and ''photographic'',{{sfn|Daniels|Bright|1996|p=653}} or the words ''electricity'' and ''electrical''. While few scholars agree with Chomsky and Halle (1968) that conventional English orthography is "near-optimal",{{sfn|Swan|2006|p=149}} there is a rationale for current English spelling patterns.{{sfn|Abercrombie|Daniels|2006}} The standard orthography of English is the most widely used writing system in the world.{{sfn|Mountford|2006|p=156}} Standard English spelling is based on a graphomorphemic segmentation of words into written clues of what meaningful units make up each word.{{sfn|Mountford|2006|pp=157<U+2013>158}}

Readers of English can generally rely on the correspondence between spelling and pronunciation to be fairly regular for letters or [[Digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] used to spell consonant sounds. The letters ''b, d, f, h, j, k, l, m, n, p, r, s, t, v, w, y, z'' represent, respectively, the phonemes {{IPA|/b, d, f, h, d<U+0292>, k, l, m, n, p, r, s, t, v, w, j, z/}}. The letters ''c'' and ''g'' normally represent {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/<U+0261>/}}, but there is also a [[Hard and soft C|soft ''c'']] pronounced {{IPA|/s/}}, and a [[Hard and soft G|soft ''g'']] pronounced {{IPA|/d<U+0292>/}}. The differences in the pronunciations of the letters ''c'' and ''g'' are often signalled by the following letters in standard English spelling. Digraphs used to represent phonemes and phoneme sequences include ''ch'' for {{IPA|/t<U+0283>/}}, ''sh'' for {{IPA|/<U+0283>/}}, ''th'' for {{IPA|/<U+03B8>/}} or {{IPA|/<U+00F0>/}}, ''ng'' for {{IPA|/<U+014B>/}}, ''qu'' for {{IPA|/kw/}}, and ''ph'' for {{IPA|/f/}} in Greek-derived words. The single letter ''x'' is generally pronounced as {{IPA|/z/}} in word-initial position and as {{IPA|/ks/}} otherwise. There are exceptions to these generalisations, often the result of loanwords being spelled according to the spelling patterns of their languages of origin{{sfn|Daniels|Bright|1996|p=653}} or proposals by pedantic scholars in the early period of Modern English to mistakenly follow the spelling patterns of Latin for English words of Germanic origin.{{sfn|Daniels|Bright|1996|p=654}}

For the vowel sounds of the English language, however, correspondences between spelling and pronunciation are more irregular. There are many more vowel phonemes in English than there are vowel letters (''a'', ''e'', ''i'', ''o'', ''u'', ''w'', ''y''). As a result of a smaller set of single letter symbols than the set of vowel phonemes, some "[[Vowel length#Short and long vowels in English|long vowels]]" are often indicated by combinations of letters (like the ''oa'' in ''boat'', the ''ow'' in ''how'', and the ''ay'' in ''stay''), or the historically based [[silent e|silent ''e'']] (as in ''note'' and ''cake'').{{sfn|Abercrombie|Daniels|2006}}

The consequence of this complex orthographic history is that learning to read can be challenging in English. It can take longer for school pupils to become independently fluent readers of English than of many other languages, including Italian, Spanish, or German.{{sfn|Dehaene|2009}} Nonetheless, there is an advantage for learners of English reading in learning the specific sound-symbol regularities that occur in the standard English spellings of commonly used words.{{sfn|Daniels|Bright|1996|p=653}} Such instruction greatly reduces the risk of children experiencing reading difficulties in English.{{sfn|McGuinness|1997}}{{sfn|Shaywitz|2003}} Making primary school teachers more aware of the primacy of morpheme representation in English may help learners learn more efficiently to read and write English.{{sfn|Mountford|2006|pp=159}}

English writing also includes a system of [[punctuation]] that is similar to the system of punctuation marks used in most alphabetic languages around the world. The purpose of punctuation is to mark meaningful grammatical relationships in sentences to aid readers in understanding a text and to indicate features important for reading a text aloud.{{sfn|Lawler|2006|p=290}}

==Dialects, accents, and varieties==
{{Main|List of dialects of the English language|World Englishes|regional accents of English}}
Dialectologists distinguish between [[List of dialects of the English language|English dialects]], regional varieties that differ from each other in terms of grammar and vocabulary, and [[Regional accents of English|regional accents]], distinguished by different patterns of pronunciation.  The major native dialects of English are often divided by linguists into the two general categories of the [[British Isles|British]] dialects (BrE) and those of [[North America]] (AmE).{{sfn|Crystal|2003b|p=107}}

===UK and Ireland===
{{See also|English language in England|Northern England English|Scots language|Scottish English|Welsh English|Estuary English|Ulster English|Hiberno-English}}
[[File:Dialects of English in UK and Ireland.svg|thumb|300px|right|Map showing the main dialect regions in the UK and Ireland.]]
As the place where English first evolved, the British Isles, and particularly England, are home to the most variegated pattern of dialects. Within the United Kingdom, the [[Received Pronunciation]] (RP), an educated dialect of [[South East England]], traditionally used as the broadcast standard, and is considered the most prestigious of the British dialects. The spread of RP (also known as BBC English) through the media has caused many traditional dialects of rural England to recede, as youths adopt the traits of the prestige variety instead of traits from local dialects.  At the time of the [[Survey of English Dialects]], grammar and vocabulary differed across the country, but a process of lexical attrition has led most of this variation to disappear.{{sfn|Trudgill|2000|p=125}} Nonetheless this attrition has mostly affected dialectal variation in grammar and vocabulary, and in fact only 3 percent of the English population actually speak RP, the remainder speaking regional accents and dialects with varying degrees of RP influence.{{sfn|Hughes|Trudgill|1996|page=3}} There is also variability within RP, particularly along class lines between Upper and Middle class RP speakers and between native RP speakers and speakers who adopt RP later in life.{{sfn|Hughes|Trudgill|1996|page=37}} Within Britain there is also considerable variation along lines of social class, and some traits though exceedingly common are considered "non-standard" and are associated with lower class speakers and identities. An example of this is [[Phonological history of English fricatives and affricates#H-dropping|aitch-dropping]], which historically was a feature of lower class London English, particularly Cockney, but which today is the standard in all major English cities <U+2014> yet it remains largely absent in broadcasting and among the upper crust of British society.{{sfn|Hughes|Trudgill|1996|page=40}}

{{listen|filename=Russell brand bbc radio4 desert island discs 21 07 2013.flac|title=Speech example|description=An example of an [[Essex]] male with a working-class Estuary accent (entertainer [[Russell Brand]])}}
[[English language in England|English in England]] can be divided into five major dialect regions, [[West Country dialects|Southwest English]], South East English, Midlands English, and [[Northern England English|Northern English]]. Within each of these regions several local subdialects exist: Within the Northern region, there is a division between the Yorkshire dialects, and the [[Geordie]] dialect spoken in Northumbria around Newcastle, and the Lancashire dialects with local urban dialects in [[Liverpool]] ([[Scouse]]) and [[Manchester]] ([[Manchester dialect|Mancunian]]). Having been the centre of Danish occupation during the Viking Invasions, Northern English dialects, particularly the Yorkshire dialect, retain Norse features not found in other English varieties. {{sfn|Hughes|Trudgill|1996|p=31}}

Since the 15th century, Southeastern varieties centred around London, which has been the centre from which dialectal innovations have spread to other dialects. In London, the [[Cockney]] dialect was traditionally used by the lower classes, and it was long a socially stigmatised variety. Today a large area of Southeastern England has adopted traits from Cockney, resulting in the so-called [[Estuary English]] which spread in areas south and East of London beginning in the 1980s. Estuary English is distinguished by traits such as the use of [[Linking and intrusive R|intrusive R]] (''drawing'' is pronounced ''drawring'' {{IPA|/<U+02C8>dr<U+0254><U+02D0>r<U+026A><U+014B>/}}), [[t-glottalization|''t''-glottalisation]] (''Potter'' is pronounced with a glottal stop as ''Po'er'' {{IPA|/po<U+0294><U+028C>/}}), and the pronunciation of ''th-'' as {{IPA|/f/}} (''thanks'' pronounced ''fanks'') or {{IPA|/v/}} (''bother'' pronounced ''bover''). {{sfn|Trudgill|2000|pages=80<U+2013>81}}

[[Scots language|Scots]] is today considered a separate language from English, but it has [[History of the Scots language|its origins]] in early Northern Middle English{{sfn|Aitken|McArthur|1979|page=81}} and developed and changed during its history with influence from other sources, particularly [[Scots Gaelic]] and Old Norse. Scots itself has a number of regional dialects. And in addition to Scots, [[Scottish English]] are the varieties of Standard English spoken in Scotland, most varieties are Northern English accents, with some influence from Scots.{{sfn|Romaine|1982}}

In [[Ireland]], various forms of English have been spoken since the [[Norman invasion of Ireland|Norman invasions]] of the 11th century. In [[County Wexford]], in the area surrounding [[Dublin]], two highly conservative dialects known as [[Forth and Bargy dialect|Forth and Bargy]] and [[Fingallian]] developed as offshoots from Early Middle English, and were spoken until the 19th century. Modern Hiberno-English however has its roots in English colonisation in the 17th century. Today Irish English is divided into Ulster English, a dialect with strong influence from Scots, and southern Hiberno-English. Like Scots and Northern English, the Irish accents preserve the rhoticity which has been lost in most dialects influenced by RP.{{sfn|Barry|1982|pp=86<U+2013>87}}{{sfn|Hickey|2007}}

===North America===
{{main|American English|General American|African American Vernacular English|Southern American English|Canadian English}}
[[File:Pin-pen.svg|thumb|300px|The merger of ''pin'' and ''pen'' in Southern American English. In the purple areas, the merger is complete for most speakers. Note the exclusion of the New Orleans area, Southern Florida, and of the [[South Carolina Lowcountry|Lowcountry]] of South Carolina and Georgia. The purple area in California consists of the [[Bakersfield]] and [[Kern County]] area, where migrants from the [[South Central United States|south-central states]] settled during the [[Dust Bowl]]. There is also debate whether or not [[Austin, Texas]] is an exclusion. Based on {{Harvcoltxt|Labov|Ash|Boberg|2006|p=68}}.]]
Even before the independence of the USA, American English was highly homogeneous. Early American authors commented on the lack of significant linguistic variation across the colonised area of the Eastern seaboard. Today there is more variation, yet two thirds of Americans speak a broad dialect known as [[General American]] (GA), although as with RP in Britain there are different accents also within it. Separate from GA is [[Southern American English]] (SAE), widely spoken in the Southern states, and [[African American Vernacular English]] (AAVE) spoken by African Americans in most major cities. Some dialectologists also recognise midlands and western dialects of American English.{{sfn|Rowicka|2006}}{{sfn|Toon|1982}}{{sfn|Labov|Ash|Boberg|2006}}{{sfn|Cassidy|1982}} [[Canadian English]], except for the maritime East Coast varieties, is mostly similar to GA, but has some distinct traits, such as the [[Canadian raising|Canadian vowel raising]], as well as distinct norms for written and formal language.{{sfn|Boberg|2010}}

General American is a rhotic accent. Whereas in Britain rhoticity is the socially marked accent, in the US non-rhotic accents are marked and often associated with lower prestige and social class. In a groundbreaking{{cn|date=April 2015}} study published in 1972 socio-linguist [[William Labov]] demonstrated this in the context of New York, by showing that rhoticity was used more frequently by employees in upscale department stores than in stores catering to middle and lower class groups, where the non-rhotic local New York accent was more frequent.{{sfn|Labov|1972}}

Southern American English is also generally non-rhotic, although class- and gender-based differences in the degree of rhoticity also apply.{{sfn|Levine|Crockett|1966}}{{sfn|Sch<U+00F6>nweitz|2001}} The Southern Accent is often colloquially described as a "drawl" or "twang".{{sfn|Montgomery|1993}} In addition to its rhoticity, SAE is characterised by a series of vowel changes, the merger of {{IPA|/<U+026A>/}} and {{IPA|/<U+025B>/}} before nasals (the [[Phonological history of English high front vowels#Pin<U+2013>pen merger|pin<U+2013>pen merger]]), the monophthongisation of some diphthongs, and sometimes creation of triphthongs by the breaking of a single front vowel into two syllables with an intervening glide, e.g. in the word "dress" pronounced as {{IPA|[d<U+027D>ei<U+0259>s]}}.{{sfn|Thomas|2008|page=95<U+2013>96}} Traditionally Southern American English has been considered to have arisen as a result of the settlement history of the southern states, however more recent research has suggested that many distinctive southern features did not become widespread until the 19th century.{{sfn|Bailey|1997}}

African American Vernacular English is also a non-rhotic accent, and some linguists ascribe this and other defining traits of the variety to its origins among enslaved Africans in the American South where non-rhotic English was spoken. Others however ascribe the distinguishing traits to substrate influence from different African languages spoken by the slaves who had to use [[Creole English]] as a ''lingua franca'' between slaves of different ethnic origins.{{sfn|Bailey|2001}} After abolition most African Americans settled in the inner cities of the North and here African American English developed to a highly coherent and homogeneous variety. It has often been stigmatised as a form of "broken" or "uneducated" English, but today linguists recognise it as a fully developed variety of English with its own norms shared by a large speech community.{{sfn|Green|2002}}{{sfn|Patrick|2006b}}

===Australia and New Zealand===
{{main|Australian English|New Zealand English}}
Since 1788 English has been spoken in [[Oceania]], and the major native dialect of [[Australian English]] is spoken as a first language by the vast majority of the inhabitants of the Australian continent, with [[General Australian]] serving as the standard accent. The [[New Zealand English|English of neighbouring New Zealand]] has to a lesser degree become influential standard variety of the language.{{sfn|Eagleson|1982}} Australian and New Zealand English are most closely related to British English, and both have similarly non-rhotic accents. They do however stand out for their innovative vowels, many short vowels are fronted or raised, whereas many long vowels have diphthongised. Australian English also has a contrast between long and short vowels, not found in most other varieties. Australian English grammar differs from British English only in few instances, one difference is the lack of verbal concord with collective plural subjects.{{sfn|Trudgill|Hannah|2002|pages=16<U+2013>21}}{{sfn|Burridge|2010}} New Zealand English differs little from Australian English, but a few characteristics sets its accent apart, such as the use of {{IPA|[<U+028D>]}} for wh- and its front vowels being even closer than in Australian English. Some New Zealand accents of the South Island are rhotic, perhaps because settlers here often came from Scotland and Northern England rather than from the Southeast.{{sfn|Trudgill|Hannah|2002|pages=24<U+2013>26}}{{sfn|Maclagan|2010}}{{sfn|Gordon|Campbell|Hay et al.|2004}}

===Africa, the Caribbean, and south Asia===
{{See also|South African English|Caribbean English}}

English is spoken widely in South Africa and is an official or co-official language in several countries. In [[South Africa]], English has been spoken since 1820, co-existing with [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]] and various African languages such as the [[Khoe languages|Khoe]] and [[Bantu languages]]. Today about 9 percent of the South African population speak [[South African English]] (SAE) as a first language. SAE is a non-rhotic variety, which tends to follow RP as a norm. It is alone among non-rhotic varieties in lacking intrusive r. There are different L2 varieties that differ based on the native language of the speakers.{{sfn|Lanham|1982}} Most phonological differences from RP are in the vowels.{{sfn|Lass|2002}} Consonant differences include the tendency to pronounce /p, t, t<U+0361><U+0283>, k/ without aspiration (e.g. /pin/ pronounced {{IPA|[p<U+026A>n]}} rather than as {{IPA|[p<U+02B0><U+026A>n]}} as in most other varieties), while r is often pronounced as a flap {{IPA|[<U+027E>]}} instead of as the more common fricative.{{sfn|Trudgill|Hannah|2002|pages=30<U+2013>31}}

Several varieties of English are also spoken in the Caribbean Islands that were colonial possessions of Britain, including Jamaica, and the [[Leeward Islands|Leeward]] and [[Windward Islands]] and [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[Barbados]], the [[Cayman Islands]], and [[Belize]]. Each of these areas are home both to a local variety of English and a local English based creole, combining English and African languages. The most prominent varieties are [[Jamaican English]] and [[Jamaican English Creole|Jamaican Creole]]. In Central America, English based creoles are spoken in on the Caribbean coasts of Nicaragua and Panama. {{sfn|Lawton|1982}} Locals are often fluent both in the local English variety and the local creole languages and [[code-switching]] between them is frequent, indeed another way to conceptualise the relationship between Creole and Standard varieties is to see a spectrum of social registers with the Creole forms serving as "basolect" and the more RP-like forms serving as the "acrolect", the most formal register.{{sfn|Trudgill|Hannah|2002|page=115}}

Most Caribbean varieties are based on British English and consequently most are non-rhotic, except for formal styles of Jamaican English which are often rhotic. Jamaican English differs from RP in its vowel inventory, which has a distinction between long and short vowels rather than tense and lax vowels as in Standard English. The diphthongs /ei/ and /ou/ are monophthongs {{IPA|[e:]}} and {{IPA|[o:]}} or even the reverse diphthongs {{IPA|[ie]}} and {{IPA|[uo]}} (e.g. ''bay'' and ''boat'' pronounced {{IPA|{b<U+02B2>e:}}} and {{IPA|[b<U+02B7>o:t]}}). Often word final consonant clusters are simplified so that "child" is pronounced {{IPA|[t<U+0361><U+0283>ail]}} and "wind" {{IPA|[win]}}.{{sfn|Trudgill|Hannah|2002|pages=117<U+2013>18}}{{sfn|Lawton|1982|page=256<U+2013>60}}{{sfn|Trudgill|Hannah|2002|pages=115<U+2013>16}}

As a historical legacy, [[Indian English]] tends to take RP as its ideal, and how well this ideal is realised in an individual's speech reflects class distinctions among Indian English speakers. Indian English accents are marked by the pronunciation of phonemes such as /t/ and /d/ (often pronounced with retroflex articulation as {{IPA|[<U+0288>]}} and {{IPA|[<U+0256>]}}) and the replacement of {{IPA|/<U+03B8>/}} and {{IPA|/<U+00F0>/}} with dentals {{IPA|[t<U+032A>]}} and {{IPA|[d<U+032A>]}}. Sometimes Indian English speakers may also use spelling based pronunciations where the silent <h> found in words such as ''ghost'' is pronounced as an Indian voiced aspirated stop {{IPA|g<U+02B1>}}.{{sfn|Sailaja|2009|pages=19<U+2013>24}}
