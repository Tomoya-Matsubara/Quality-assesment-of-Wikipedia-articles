He remains in history as the first scorer for a romanian team in the European competitions, scoring the first goal of [[Venus Bucure<U+015F>ti]] in the First Round of 1937 [[Mitropa Cup]], against [[Ujpest FC]] from [[Hungary]]. The match was lost by Venus, 4-6, with Choumis scoring also the last goal of the romanian team.<ref>[http://www.romaniansoccer.ro/europeancups/1937/venus_ujpest_budapest_01.shtml Venus - Ujpest, 1937 @ Romaniansoccer.ro]</ref>
