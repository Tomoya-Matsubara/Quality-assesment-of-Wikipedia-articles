"'''Radio Free Europe'''" is a song by [[United States|American]] [[alternative rock]] band [[R.E.M.]] "Radio Free Europe" was released as R.E.M.'s debut single on the short-lived [[independent record label]] [[Hib-Tone]] in 1981. The song features "what were to become the trademark unintelligible lyrics which have distinguished R.E.M.'s work ever since."<ref>{{cite news

}}</ref> The single received critical acclaim, and its success earned the band a record deal with [[I.R.S. Records]]. R.E.M. re-recorded the song for its 1983 debut album ''[[Murmur (album)|Murmur]]'' and a live performance at Larry's Hideaway, [[Toronto, Canada]], from July 9, 1983 was released on the 2008 Deluxe Edition reissue of that album. The re-recording for I.R.S. became the group's first charting single, peaking at number 78 on the ''[[Billboard Hot 100]]'' chart. The song is ranked number 379 on [[Rolling Stone]] list of [[The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time]].

==Origin and original recording==
R.E.M. formed in [[Athens, Georgia]] in 1980. The band quickly established itself in the local scene. Over the course of 1980s the band refined its songwriting skills, helped by its frequent gigs at local venues. One of the groups newer compositions was "Radio Free Europe". The other members of the band were reportedly awestruck when they heard the lyrics and melodies singer [[Michael Stipe]] had written for the song.<ref name="Buckley 56">Buckley, p. 56</ref> By May 1981 the band added "Radio Free Europe" to its setlist.<ref>Buckley, p. 52</ref>

After a successful show opening for [[The Police]], R.E.M. intended to record material for a demo tape. The group traveled to Drive-In Studios in [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina|Winston-Salem]], [[North Carolina]], to record some songs with producer [[Mitch Easter]], who was a member of the band [[Let's Active]].<ref name="Buckley 56" /> The band recorded "Radio Free Europe", "[[Sitting Still]]", and the instrumental song "White Tornado", which were placed on a promotional cassette tape. The band sent out 400 copies, one of which was received by Athens law student Johnny Hibbert. Hibbert felt the recording was unsatisfactory, and oversaw a remix. Easter said he found the presence of Hibbert "distracting" and added, "He came into my studio and it was like, now the big city guy is going to do it right. We mixed the song for about 12 hours and really, there wasn't enough equipment to warrant more than 45 minutes."<ref>Buckley, p. 57</ref> The final mastering of the song disappointed the band. Guitarist [[Peter Buck]], who described the recording years later as "muddy and hi-end", expressed his displeasure by breaking a copy of the finished single and nailing to his wall. In contrast, Buck also admitted that "there's something to be said for the original sort of murky feeling for [the original recording]".<ref>Buckley, p. 58</ref>

===Cover art===
The cover art to the single came courtesy of [[Michael Stipe]]. "Michael brought those negatives over to our place," explains photographer Terry Allen. "He said, 'Can you make a print of these?' and we said, 'What, you want a picture of this blur?' He said, 'Yeah,' and so I said, 'I've got a picture that's probably better than this that you can use,' but he said, 'No, I want this blur!'"

Around 600 copies of the first pressing were sent out for promotional uses, but these omitted the Hib-Tone contact address. It was included, however, on the 6,000 copies of the second pressing.

{{Listen|filename=REM - Radio Free Europe.ogg|title="Radio Free Europe"|description=Sample of "Radio Free Euope", as recorded for R.E.M.'s debut album ''[[Murmur (album)|Murmur]]'' (1983). Rerecorded after its initial release as a single on Hib-Tone in 1981, the sample illustrates the change the verse to the pre-chorus. Guitarist Peter Buck and bassist Mike Mills play steady eight-note figures during the verse. During the prechorus, Buck switches to playing arpeggios.|format=[[Ogg]]}}
{{sample box end}}
Both the Hib-Tone and I.R.S. releases of "Radio Free Europe" begin with brief instrumental intros before the band enters. The Hib-Tone version features a brief [[synthesizer]] figure. The intro to the I.R.S. version originated as a errant system hum accidentally recorded on tape. Easter triggered the effect to open and shut an electronic noise gate in time with bassist Mike Mills' playing. The producer then manually adjusted the EQ of the effect on the studio mixing console, and spliced the seven-bar figure into the start of the recording.<ref name="Niimi 26">Niimi, p. 26</ref>

==Lyrics==
Stipe's lyrics are hard to discern, and largely serve to give the singer something to vocalize with.<ref name="Charlton">Charlton, p. 347</ref> When first developing the original song, Stipe intentionally did not want the lyrics to be understood, as he "...hadn't written any of the words yet."  Also, when the song was played live, Stipe improvised his own set of lyrics halfway through the song. <ref>Black, p. 49</ref> In a 1988 ''[[NME]]'' interview, Stipe denied the interviewer's claim that his lyrics on ''Murmur'' were "indecipherable", but acknowledged that "Radio Free Europe" was one of the few exceptions, describing it as "complete babbling".<ref>O'Hagan, Sean.

R.E.M. signed to I.R.S. Records in 1982. I.R.S. asked R.E.M. to re-record "Radio Free Europe" in 1983 for their debut album, ''Murmur''.<ref>Pond, Steve. "[http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/rem/articles/story/5938674/cover_story_in_the_real_world In the Real World]". ''Rolling Stone''. [[December 3]], [[1987]]. Retrieved on [[May 19]], [[2008]].</ref> The band agreed, because they had felt that they'd improved significantly since the original 1981 sessions.  The new version has some slightly different lyrics and a slower tempo, and is not as well-liked with the band as the original; indeed, the liner notes for the 1988 compilation album ''Eponymous'' (which the original Hib-Tone version is featured on) stated that "[[Mike Mills|Mike]] and [[Jefferson Holt|Jefferson]] think this one [referring to the Hib-Tone version] crushes the other one like a grape." Peter Buck has also stated that he "[didn't] think we captured it the way we did on the single."  Original producer Mitch Easter also commented on the re-recording, saying it was "more pro, but a little too sedate."<ref>Black, p. 74</ref>

The re-recorded version of "Radio Free Europe" was the first single from ''Murmur''. It was the first R.E.M. single to reach the charts, peaking at number 78 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' singles chart and remaining on the chart for five weeks.<ref>"[http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/6596224/radio_free_europe Radio Free Europe]".
