The heavier quarks rapidly change into up and down quarks through a process of [[particle decay]]: the transformation from a higher mass state to a lower mass state. For this reason, up and down quarks are generally stable and the most common in the universe, whereas charm, strange, top and bottom quarks can only be produced in [[high energy physics|high energy]] collisions (such as those involving [[cosmic ray]]s and in [[particle accelerator]]s).

Quarks have various intrinsic properties, including [[electric charge]], [[color charge]], [[spin (physics)|spin]] and mass. For every quark flavor there is a corresponding type of [[antiparticle]], known as ''antiquark'', that differs from the quark only in that some of its properties have [[additive inverse|equal magnitude but opposite sign]]. Quarks are the only known particles whose electric charges are not integer multiples of the [[elementary charge]].

The [[quark model]] was independently proposed by physicists [[Murray Gell-Mann]] and [[George Zweig]] in 1964.<ref name="Carithers">

Unlike [[lepton]]s, quarks possess [[color charge]], which causes them to engage in the [[strong interaction]]. The resulting attraction between different quarks causes the formation of composite particles known as ''[[hadron]]s'' (see "[[#Strong interaction and color charge|Strong interaction and color charge]]" below). 

The quarks which determine the [[quantum number]]s of hadrons are called ''valence quarks''; apart from these, any hadron may contain an indefinite number of [[virtual particle|virtual]] (or ''[[#Sea quarks|sea]]'') quarks, antiquarks and [[gluon]]s which do not influence its quantum numbers.<ref>

Israeli physicist [[Yuval Ne'eman]] had independently developed a scheme similar to the Eightfold Way in 1962, but played no part in the subsequent proposal of the quark model. At the time of the quark theory's inception, the ''[[particle zoo]]'' consisted of a few [[lepton]]s and a multitude of [[hadron]]s. Partially as a result of Gell-Mann and Ne'eman's model, Gell-Mann and Zweig posited that hadrons were not elementary particles, but were instead composed of combinations of quarks and antiquarks. Their model involved three flavors of quarks<U+2014>up, down and strange<U+2014>to which they ascribed properties such as spin and electric charge.<ref name="Gell-Man1964"/><ref name="Zweig1964a"/><ref name="Zweig1964b"/>

In less than a year, extensions to the Gell-Mann<U+2013>Zweig model were proposed when another duo of physicists, [[Sheldon Lee Glashow]] and [[James Bjorken]], predicted the existence of a fourth flavor of quark, which they referred to as ''charm''.  The addition was proposed because it allowed a better description of the [[weak interaction]] (the mechanism that allows quarks to [[particle decay|decay]]), equalized the number of known quarks with the number of known leptons, and implied a mass formula that correctly reproduced the masses of the known mesons.<ref>

{{quotebox|In 1963, when I assigned the name "quark" to the fundamental constituents of the nucleon, I had the sound first, without the spelling, which could have been "kwork". Then, in one of my occasional perusals of ''Finnegans Wake'', by James Joyce, I came across the word "quark" in the phrase "Three quarks for Muster Mark". Since "quark" (meaning, for one thing, the cry of the gull) was clearly intended to rhyme with "Mark", as well as "bark" and other such words, I had to find an excuse to pronounce it as "kwork". But the book represents the dream of a publican named Humphrey Chimpden Earwicker. Words in the text are typically drawn from several sources at once, like the "portmanteau" words in "Through the Looking-Glass". From time to time, phrases occur in the book that are partially determined by calls for drinks at the bar. I argued, therefore, that perhaps one of the multiple sources of the cry "Three quarks for Muster Mark" might be "Three quarts for Mister Mark", in which case the pronunciation "kwork" would not be totally unjustified. In any case, the number three fitted perfectly the way quarks occur in nature.}}

Zweig preferred the name ''ace'' for the particle he had theorized, but Gell-Mann's terminology came to prominence once the quark model had been commonly accepted.<ref>

== Properties ==
=== Electric charge ===
{{See also|Electric charge}}
Quarks have fractional electric charge values, either <U+2212>{{frac|1|3}} or +{{frac|2|3}} times the [[elementary charge]] (''e'') depending on flavor: up, charm and top quarks (collectively referred to as ''up-type quarks'') have a charge of +{{frac|2|3}}, while down, strange and bottom quarks (''down-type quarks'') have <U+2212>{{frac|1|3}}. Antiquarks have the [[additive inverse|opposite]] charge to their corresponding quarks; up-type antiquarks have charges of <U+2212>{{frac|2|3}} and down-type antiquarks have charges of +{{frac|1|3}}. Since the electric charge of a hadron is the sum of the charges of the constituent quarks, all hadrons have [[integer]] charges: the combination of three quarks (baryons), three antiquarks (antibaryons), or a quark and an antiquark (mesons) always result in integer charges.<ref>

=== Spin ===
{{See also|Spin (physics)}}
Spin is an intrinsic property of elementary particles, and its direction is an important [[Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degree of freedom]]. It is sometimes visualized as the rotation of an object around its own axis (hence the name ''[[Wikt:spin|spin]]''), but this notion is somewhat misguided at subatomic scales because elementary particles are believed to be [[point particle|point-like]].<ref>

Spin can be represented by a [[euclidean vector|vector]] whose length is measured in units of ''h''/(2<U+03C0>), where ''h'' is the [[Planck constant]]. This value is often denoted by ''<U+0127>'' ("h bar"), and called the "reduced Planck constant". For quarks, a measurement of the spin vector [[vector projection|component]] along any axis can only yield the values +''<U+0127>''/2 or <U+2212>''<U+0127>''/2; for this reason quarks are classified as [[spin-<U+00BD>|spin-{{frac|1|2}}]] particles.<ref>

=== Weak interaction ===
{{Main|Weak interaction}}

[[Image:Beta Negative Decay.svg|thumb|right|232px|upright|[[Feynman diagram]] of [[beta decay]] with time flowing upwards. The CKM matrix (discussed below) encodes the probability of this and other quark decays.|alt=A tree diagram consisting mostly of straight arrows. A down quark forks into a up quark and a wavy-arrow W<U+2212> boson, the latter forking into an electron and reversed-arrow electron antineutino.]]
A quark of one flavor can transform into a quark of another flavor only through the weak interaction, one of the four [[fundamental interaction]]s in particle physics. By absorbing or emitting a [[W boson]], any up-type quark (up, charm and top quarks) can change into any down-type quark (down, strange and bottom quarks) and vice versa. This flavor transformation mechanism causes the [[radioactive decay|radioactive]] process of [[beta decay]], in which a neutron ({{SubatomicParticle|neutron}}) "splits" into a proton ({{SubatomicParticle|proton}}), an [[electron]] ({{SubatomicParticle|electron}}) and an [[electron antineutrino]] ({{SubatomicParticle|electron antineutrino}}) (see picture). This occurs when one of the down quarks in the neutron ({{SubatomicParticle|up quark}}{{SubatomicParticle|down quark}}{{SubatomicParticle|down quark}}) decays into an up quark by emitting a [[virtual particle|virtual]] {{SubatomicParticle|W boson-}} boson, transforming the neutron into a proton ({{SubatomicParticle|up quark}}{{SubatomicParticle|up quark}}{{SubatomicParticle|down quark}}). The {{SubatomicParticle|W boson-}} boson then decays into an electron and an electron antineutrino.<ref name="SLAC">

While the process by which quarks transform into one another is the same for all quarks, each quark has a certain preference to transform into the quark of its own generation. The relative tendencies of the various transformations from quarks of one flavor to another are described in a comprehensive [[matrix (mathematics)|mathematical table]] called the [[Cabibbo<U+2013>Kobayashi<U+2013>Maskawa matrix]] (or CKM matrix). The approximate [[absolute value|magnitudes]] of the entries of the CKM matrix are:<ref name="PDG2008">

The system of attraction and repulsion between quarks charged with different combinations of the three colors is called [[strong interaction]], which is [[force carrier|mediated by particles]] known as ''[[gluon]]s''; this is discussed at length [[#Color confinement and gluons|below]]. The theory that describes strong interactions is called [[quantum chromodynamics]] (QCD). A quark charged with one color value can form a [[bound state|bound system]] with an antiquark carrying the corresponding anticolor; three (anti)quarks, one of each (anti)color, will similarly be bound together. The result of two attracting quarks will be color neutrality: a quark with color charge ''<U+03BE>''  plus an antiquark with color charge <U+2212>''<U+03BE>'' will result in a color charge of 0 (or "white" color) and the formation of a meson. Analogous to the [[additive color]] model in basic [[optics]], the combination of three quarks or three antiquarks, each with different color charges, will result in the same "white" color charge and the formation of a baryon or antibaryon.<ref>

=== Table of properties ===
{{See also|Flavor (physics)}}
The following table summarizes the key properties of the six quarks. [[Flavour quantum numbers|Flavor quantum numbers]] ([[isospin]] (''I''<sub>z</sub>), [[strangeness (particle physics)|strangeness]] (''S'', not to be confused with [[spin (physics)|spin]]), [[charm]] (''C''), [[bottomness]] (''B''&prime;) and [[topness]] (''T'')) are assigned to certain quark flavors, and denote qualities of quark-based systems and hadrons. The [[baryon number]] (''B'') is +{{frac|1|3}} for all quarks, as baryons are made of three quarks. For antiquarks, the electric charge (''Q'') and all flavor quantum numbers (''B'', ''I''<sub>z</sub>, ''C'', ''S'', ''T'' and ''B''&prime;) are of opposite sign. Mass and [[total angular momentum]] (''J''; equal to spin for point particles) do not change sign for the antiquarks.

As described by quantum chromodynamics, the [[strong interaction]] between quarks is mediated by gluons, massless [[vector boson|vector]] [[gauge bosons]]. Each gluon carries one color charge and one anticolor charge. In the standard framework of particle interactions (part of a more general formulation known as [[perturbation theory]]), gluons are constantly exchanged between quarks through a [[virtual particle|virtual]] emission and absorption process. When a gluon is transferred between quarks, a color change occurs in both; for example, if a red quark emits a red<U+2013>antigreen gluon, it becomes green, and if a green quark absorbs a red<U+2013>antigreen gluon, it becomes red. Therefore, while each quark's color constantly changes, their strong interaction is preserved.<ref>

Since gluons carry color charge, they themselves are able to emit and absorb other gluons. This causes ''[[asymptotic freedom]]'': as quarks come closer to each other, the chromodynamic binding force between them weakens.<ref>

}}</ref> Conversely, as the distance between quarks increases, the binding force strengthens. The color field becomes stressed, much as an elastic band is stressed when stretched, and more gluons of appropriate color are spontaneously created to strengthen the field. Above a certain energy threshold, [[pair creation|pairs of quarks and antiquarks will be created]] which bind to the quarks being separated, forming new hadrons. This phenomenon is known as ''[[color confinement]]'': quarks never appear in isolation.<ref name="Veltman">

Hadrons. along with the ''valence quarks'' ({{SubatomicParticle|valence quark}}) that contribute to their [[quantum number]]s, contain [[virtual particle|virtual]] quark<U+2013>antiquark ({{SubatomicParticle|quark}}{{SubatomicParticle|antiquark}}) pairs known as ''sea quarks'' ({{SubatomicParticle|sea quark}}). Such sea quarks form when a gluon of the hadron's color field splits; this process also works in reverse in that the [[annihilation]] of two sea quarks produces a gluon. The result is a constant flux of gluon splits and creation colloquially known as "the sea".<ref>

Virtual quark<U+2013>antiquark pairs have a tendency to form what can be described as a kind of "cloud" or "shield" around the valence quarks in hadrons. This cloud is complemented by another layer of virtual gluons lying beyond it. These layers adopt color charges based on the valence quark they surround. Quantum chromodynamics causes the virtual antiquarks in the cloud<U+2014>which exhibit the anticolor of the valence quark<U+2014>to be closer to the inside of the field. In the case of a red quark, for instance, the antired virtual antiquarks would tend to be closer to the red valence quark than their red virtual quark partners. This disparity in proximity and the anticolor barrier it creates has the effect of "de-amplifying" the color charge of the valence quark. However, this anticolor tilt is neutralized by the virtual gluon field beyond, which carries the original color charge and "re-amplifies" the valence quark's color. The canceling of these two influences on the valence quark results in the balanced color charge that valence quarks have been observed to possess.<ref name="Har">

Under sufficiently extreme conditions, quarks may become deconfined and exist as free particles. In the course of [[asymptotic freedom]], the strong interaction becomes weaker at higher temperatures. Eventually, color confinement would be lost and an extremely hot [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] of freely moving quarks and gluons would be formed. This theoretical phase of matter is called [[quark<U+2013>gluon plasma]].<ref>

The quark<U+2013>gluon plasma would be characterized by a great increase in the number of heavier quark pairs in relation to the number of up and down quark pairs. It is believed that in the period prior to 10<sup><U+2212>6</sup> seconds after the [[Big Bang]] (the [[quark epoch]]), the universe was filled with quark<U+2013>gluon plasma, as the temperature was too high for hadrons to be stable.<ref>

Given sufficiently high baryon densities and relatively low temperatures<U+2014>possibly comparable to those found in [[neutron star]]s<U+2014>quark matter is expected to degenerate into a [[Fermi liquid]] of weakly-interacting quarks. This liquid would be characterized by a [[condensation]] of colored quark [[Cooper pair]]s, thereby [[spontaneous symmetry breaking|breaking the local SU(3)<sub>c</sub> symmetry]]. Because quark Cooper pairs harbor color charge, such a phase of quark matter would be [[color superconductivity|color superconductive]]; that is, color charge would be able to pass through it with no resistance.<ref>
