It is bordered on the north by the [[North Sea]], [[Denmark]], and the [[Baltic Sea]], on the east by [[Poland]] and the [[Czech Republic]], on the south by [[Austria]] and [[Switzerland]], and on the west by [[France]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Belgium]] and the [[Netherlands]].

==History==
{{main|History of Germany}}
The state now known as Germany was [[political union|unified]] as a modern nation-state only in [[1871]], when the [[German Empire]] was forged, with the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] as its largest constituent. This began the German ''[[Reich]]'', usually translated as ''empire'', but also meaning ''kingdom'', ''domain'' or ''realm''.

===Early history of the Germanic tribes (100 BC &ndash; AD 300)===
{{main|Germanic peoples|Germania}} 	 
The [[ethnogenesis]] of the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribes]] is assumed to have occurred during the [[Nordic Bronze Age]], or at the latest, during the [[Pre-Roman Iron Age]]. From southern [[Scandinavia]] and northern Germany, the tribes began expanding south, east and west in the 1st century&nbsp;BC, coming into contact with the [[Celt]]ic tribes of [[Gaul]] as well as [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]], [[Balts|Baltic]], and [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] tribes in [[Eastern Europe]]. Little is known about early Germanic history, except through their interactions with the [[Roman Empire]] and archaeological finds.<ref name="Claster">Jill N. Claster: ''Medieval Experience: 300-1400''. NYU Press 1982, p. 35. ISBN 0814713815.</ref>
 		 
[[Image:Germanen_50_n._Chr.png|thumb|left|180px|Germanic tribes in 50&nbsp;AD (not including Scandinavia)]] 	 
Under [[Augustus]], the Roman General [[Publius Quinctilius Varus]] began to invade Germany, and it was in this period that the German tribes became familiar with Roman tactics of warfare while maintaining their national identity. In AD&nbsp;9, three [[Roman legion]]s led by [[Publius Quinctilius Varus]] were defeated by the [[Cheruscan]] leader [[Arminius]] (Hermann) in the [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]]. Germany, as far as the Rhine and the Danube, thus remained outside the [[Roman Empire]]. By AD&nbsp;100, the time of [[Tacitus]]' ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]'', Germanic tribes settled along the Rhine and the Danube (the [[Limes Germanicus]]), occupying most of the area of modern Germany. The third century saw the emergence of a number of large West Germanic tribes: [[Alamanni]], [[Franks]], [[Chatti]], [[Saxons]], [[Frisians]], [[Sicambri]], and [[Thuringii]]. Around 260, the Germanic peoples broke through the Limes and the Danube frontier.<ref name="Cambridge ancient history">The Cambridge Ancient History, vol. 12, p. 442. ISBN 0521301998.</ref> 	 {{see also|List of meanings of countries' names}}

===The Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation (843&ndash;1806)===
{{main|Holy Roman Empire}}
[[Image: Balduineum Wahl Heinrich VII.jpg|thumb|left|185px|[[Prince-elector]]s of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], from a 1341 parchment.]]
The medieval empire stemmed from a division of the [[Carolingian Empire]] in 843, which was founded by [[Charlemagne]] on [[December 25]] [[800]], and existed in varying forms until 1806, its territory stretching from the [[Eider River]] in the north to the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] coast in the south. Often referred to as the ''Holy Roman Empire'' (or the ''Old Empire''), it was officially called the ''Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation'' ("Sacrum Romanum Imperium Nationis Germanic<U+00E6>") starting in 1448, to adjust the title to its then reduced territory.

Under the reign of the [[Ottonian]] emperors (919&ndash;1024), the [[Stem duchy|duchies]] of [[Duchy of Lorraine|Lorraine]], [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxony]], [[Franconia]], [[Swabia]], [[Thuringia]], and [[Bavaria]] were consolidated, and the German king was crowned [[Holy Roman Emperor]] of these regions in 962. Under the reign of the [[Salian]] emperors (1024&ndash;1125), the Holy Roman Empire absorbed northern [[Italy]] and [[Burgundy]], although the emperors lost power through the [[Investiture Controversy]]. Under the [[Hohenstaufen]] emperors (1138&ndash;1254), the German princes increased their influence further south and east into territories inhabited by [[Slavic peoples|Slavs]]. Northern German towns grew prosperous as members of the [[Hanseatic League]].
[[Image:Martin Luther by Lucas Cranach der <U+00C4>ltere.jpeg|thumb|right|120px|[[Martin Luther]], 1529]]
The edict of the [[Golden Bull of 1356|Golden Bull]] in 1356 provided the basic constitution of the empire that lasted until its dissolution. It codified the election of the emperor by seven [[prince-elector]]s who ruled some of the most powerful principalities and archbishoprics. Beginning in the fifteenth century, the emperors were elected nearly exclusively from the [[Habsburg]] dynasty of [[Archduchy of Austria|Austria]].

The monk [[Martin Luther]] wrote his [[The 95 Theses|95 Theses]] questioning the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in 1517, thereby sparking the [[Protestant Reformation]]. A separate [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] church was acknowledged as the new sanctioned religion in many states of Germany in 1530. Religious conflict led to the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618&ndash;1648), which devastated German lands. The [[Peace of Westphalia]] (1648) ended religious warfare in Germany, but the empire was ''de facto'' divided into numerous independent principalities. From 1740 onwards, the dualism between the Austrian [[Habsburg Monarchy]] and the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] dominated German history. In 1806, the ''Imperium'' was overrun and dissolved as a result of the [[Napoleonic Wars]].<ref name="concise h">Fulbrook, Mary: ''A Concise History of Germany'', Cambridge University Press 1991, p. 97. ISBN 0521540712</ref>

===Restoration and revolution (1814&ndash;71)===
{{main|German Confederation}}
Following the fall of [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]], the [[Congress of Vienna]] convened in 1814 and founded the [[German Confederation]], a loose league of [[List of German Confederation member states|39 sovereign states]]. Disagreement with [[restoration]] politics partly led to the rise of [[Liberalism in Germany|liberal]] movements, demanding unity and freedom. These, however, were followed by new measures of repression on the part of the Austrian statesman [[Klemens Wenzel von Metternich|Metternich]]. The ''[[Zollverein]]'', a tariff union, profoundly furthered economic unity in the German states. During this era, many Germans had been stirred by the ideals of the [[French Revolution]] and [[nationalism]] became a more significant force, especially among young intellectuals. For the first time, the colours of black, red and gold were chosen to represent the movement, which later became the [[Flag of Germany|national colours]].<ref>Martin, Norman. [http://www.fotw.net/flags/de1848.html German Confederation 1815-1866 (Germany)] Flags of the World. Oct. 5, 2000. Retrieved [[2006]], [[December 7|12-07]].</ref>
[[Image: Nationalversammlung.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Frankfurt Parliament in 1848]]
In light of a [[Revolutions of 1848|series of revolutionary movements in Europe]], which successfully established a republic [[Revolutions of 1848 in France|in France]], intellectuals and commoners started the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states]]. The monarchs initially yielded to the revolutionaries' liberal demands. King [[Frederick William IV of Prussia|Frederick William IV]] of Prussia was offered the title of [[Emperor]], but with a loss of power; he rejected the crown and the proposed constitution, leading to a temporary setback for the movement. Conflict between King [[William I, German Emperor|William I]] of Prussia and the increasingly liberal parliament erupted over military reforms in 1862 and the king appointed [[Otto von Bismarck]] the new [[Prime Minister of Prussia]]. Bismark successfully waged [[Second War of Schleswig|war on Denmark]] in 1864. Prussian victory in the [[Austro-Prussian War]] of 1866 enabled him to create the [[North German Confederation]] and to exclude [[Austrian Empire|Austria]], formerly the leading German state, from the affairs of the remaining German states.

===Second German Empire (1871<U+2013>1918)===
[[Image:Reichsgruendung2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Foundation of modern Germany in [[Versailles]], [[France]],  1871. [[Bismarck]] at the center in a white uniform.]]
{{main|German Empire}}
After the French defeat in the [[Franco-Prussian War]], the [[German Empire]] (''Deutsches Kaiserreich'') was proclaimed in [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]] on [[January 18]] [[1871]]. The [[House of Hohenzollern|Hohenzollern]] dynasty of Prussia ruled the new empire, whose capital was [[Berlin]]. The empire was a unification of all the scattered parts of Germany except Austria ([[Kleindeutsche L<U+00F6>sung|''Kleindeutschland'']], or "Lesser Germany"). Beginning in 1884, Germany began establishing [[List of former German colonies|several colonies]] outside of Europe.

In the ''[[Gr<U+00FC>nderzeit]]'' period following the [[unification of Germany]], Emperor [[William I, German Emperor|William I]]'s foreign policy secured Germany's position as a great nation by forging alliances, isolating [[French Third Republic|France]] by diplomatic means, and avoiding war. Under [[William II, German Emperor|William II]], however, Germany, [[New Imperialism|like other European powers]], took an [[Imperialism|imperialistic]] course leading to friction with neighbouring countries. Most alliances in which Germany had been previously involved were not renewed, and new alliances excluded the country. Specifically, France established new relationships by signing the [[Entente Cordiale]] with the [[United Kingdom]] and securing ties with the [[Russian Empire]]. Aside from its contacts with [[Austria-Hungary]], Germany became increasingly isolated.

[[Image:Map-deutsches-kaiserreich.png|left|thumb|Imperial Germany (1871<U+2013>1918)]]
Germany's imperialism reached outside of its own country and joined many other powers in Europe to claim their share of [[Africa]]. The [[Berlin Conference]] divided Africa between the European powers. Germany owned several pieces of land on Africa including German East Africa, South-West Africa, Togo, and [[Cameroon]]. [[The Scramble for Africa]] caused tension between the [[Great Powers]] that may have contributed to the conditions that led to [[World War I]].

The [[Assassination in Sarajevo|assassination]] of [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Austria's crown prince]] on [[July 28]] [[1914]] triggered [[World War I]]. Germany, as part of the unsuccessful [[Central Powers]], suffered defeat against the [[Allies|Allied Powers]] in [[World War I casualties|one of the bloodiest]] conflicts of all time. The [[German Revolution]] broke out in November 1918, and Emperor William II and all German ruling princes [[Abdication|abdicated]]. An [[Armistice with Germany (Compi<U+00E8>gne)|armistice]] putting an end to the war was signed on [[November 11]] and Germany was forced to sign the [[Treaty of Versailles]] in June 1919. Its negotiation, contrary to traditional post-war diplomacy, excluded the defeated Central Powers. The treaty was perceived in Germany as a humiliating continuation of the war by other means and its harshness is often cited as having facilitated the later rise of [[Nazism]] in the country.<ref name="lee h">Stephen J. Lee: ''Europe, 1890-1945''. Routledge 2003, p. 131. ISBN 0415254558.</ref>

===Weimar Republic (1919&ndash;33)===
[[Image:Deutsches_Reich_1925_b.png|right|thumb|200px|Subdivisions of Germany in 1925. Map showing borders of Germany from 1919 until 1937.]]
{{main|Weimar Republic}}
After the success of the [[German Revolution]] in November 1918, a [[Weimar Republic|republic]] was proclaimed. The [[Weimar Constitution]] came into effect with its signing by [[President of Germany|President]] [[Friedrich Ebert]] on [[August 11]], [[1919]]. The [[Communist Party of Germany|German Communist Party]] was established by [[Rosa Luxemburg]] and [[Karl Liebknecht]] in 1918, and the German Workers Party, later known as the National Socialist German Workers Party or [[Nazi Party]], was founded in January 1919.

Suffering from the [[Great Depression]], the harsh peace conditions dictated by the [[Treaty of Versailles]], and a long succession of more or less unstable governments, the political masses in Germany increasingly lacked identification with their political system of [[parliamentary democracy]]. This was exacerbated by a wide-spread right-wing ([[Monarchism|monarchist]], ''[[V<U+00F6>lkisch movement|v<U+00F6>lkisch]]'', and [[Nazi Party|Nazi]]) ''[[Dolchsto<U+00DF>legende]]'', a political myth which claimed that Germany lost World War I because of the [[German Revolution]], not because of military defeat. On the other hand, radical left-wing [[communism|communists]], such as the [[Spartacist League]], had wanted to abolish what they perceived as "[[Capitalism|capitalist rule]]" in favour of a ''[[Council communism|R<U+00E4>terepublik]]''. Paramilitary troops were set up by several parties and there were thousands of politically motivated murders. The paramilitary intimidated voters and seeded violence and anger among the public, which suffered from high unemployment and poverty. After a succession of unsuccessful cabinets, President [[Paul von Hindenburg]], seeing little alternative and pushed by right-wing advisors, appointed [[Adolf Hitler]] [[Chancellor of Germany]] on [[January 30]], [[1933]].

===Third Reich (1933&ndash;45)===
[[Image:Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler.jpg|thumb|160px|right|[[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Benito Mussolini]] in [[Axis Powers of World War II|Axis]]-occupied [[Yugoslavia]].]]
{{main|Nazi Germany|World War II}}
On [[27 February]] [[1933]], the [[Reichstag fire|Reichstag was set on fire]]. Some basic democratic rights were quickly abrogated afterwards under an emergency decree. An [[Enabling Act]] gave Hitler's government full legislative power. Only the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] voted against it; the Communists were not able to present a viable opposition, as many of their deputies had already been murdered or imprisoned.<ref name="Stackelberg">Roderick Stackelberg, ''Hitler's Germany: origins, interpretations, legacies''. Routledge 1999, p. 103. ISBN 0415201144.</ref><ref>Scheck, Raffael. [http://www.colby.edu/personal/r/rmscheck/GermanyE1.html Establishing a Dictatorship: The Stabilization of Nazi Power] Colby College. Retrieved [[2006]], [[December 7|12-07]].</ref> A centralized [[totalitarian]] state was established by a series of moves and decrees making Germany a [[single-party state]]. Industry was closely regulated with quotas and requirements in order to shift the economy towards a war production base. In 1936, German troops entered the demilitarized [[Rhineland]] and [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[Neville Chamberlain]]'s [[appeasement]] policies proved inadequate. Emboldened, Hitler followed from 1938 onwards a policy of [[expansionism]] to establish [[Gro<U+00DF>deutschland|Greater Germany]]. To avoid a two-front war, Hitler concluded the [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]] with the [[Soviet Union]], a pact which was later broken by Germany.

In 1939, the [[Causes of World War II|growing tensions from nationalism, militarism, and territorial issues]] led to the Germans launching a [[blitzkrieg]] on [[September 1]] against [[Poland]], followed two days later by declarations of war by Britain and France, marking the beginning of World War II. Germany quickly gained direct or indirect control of the majority of [[Europe]].
[[Image:Potsdamer Platz 1945.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Berlin in ruins after [[World War II]], Potsdamer Platz 1945]]
On [[June 22]], [[1941]], Hitler broke the pact with the Soviet Union by opening the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] and [[Operation Barbarossa|invading the Soviet Union]]. Shortly after Japan [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|attacked the American base at Pearl Harbor]], Germany declared war on the United States. Although initially the German army rapidly advanced into the surprised [[Soviet Union]], the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] marked a major turning point in the war. Subsequently, the German army commenced retreating on the Eastern front, followed by the eventual defeat of Germany. On [[8 May]] [[1945]], [[Victory in Europe Day|Germany surrendered]] after the [[Red Army]] occupied [[Berlin]].

In what later became known as [[The Holocaust]], the Third Reich regime enacted governmental policies directly subjugating many parts of society: [[Jew]]s, [[Slavic peoples|Slavs]], Communists, [[Roma people|Roma]], [[homosexuality|homosexuals]], [[Freemasonry|freemasons]], political dissidents, priests, preachers, religious opponents, and the [[disability|disabled]], amongst others. During the Nazi era, about eleven million people were murdered in the Holocaust, including six million Jews. World War II and the Nazi genocide were responsible for about 35 million dead in Europe.

===Division and reunification (1945-90)===

{{main|History of Germany since 1945}}
The war resulted in the death of several million German soldiers and civilians, in total nearly ten million; [[Oder-Neisse line|large territorial losses]]; [[Expulsion of Germans after World War II|the expulsion of about 15 million Germans]] from other countries; and the destruction of multiple major cities. Germany and [[Berlin]] were partitioned by the [[Allies]] into four military occupation zones. The sectors controlled by [[France]], the [[United Kingdom]], and the [[United States]] were merged on [[May 23]] [[1949]], to form the democratic nation of the ''Federal Republic of Germany''; on [[October 7]] [[1949]], the Soviet Zone established the ''German Democratic Republic''. In English, the two states were known informally as "[[West Germany]]" and "[[East Germany]]".

West Germany, established as a liberal parliamentary republic with a "[[social market economy]]", was allied with the United States, the UK and France. The country eventually came to enjoy prolonged economic growth beginning in the early 1950s (''[[Wirtschaftswunder]]''). West Germany joined [[NATO]] in 1955 and was a founding member of the [[European Economic Community]] in 1958. Across the border, East Germany was at first occupied by, and later (May 1955) allied with, the USSR. An authoritarian country with a Soviet-style [[command economy]], East Germany soon became the richest, most advanced country in the [[Warsaw Pact]], but many of its citizens looked to the West for political freedoms and economic prosperity.<ref>Colchester, Nico.

However, tensions between East and West Germany were somewhat reduced in the early 1970s by Chancellor [[Willy Brandt|Willy Brandt's]] ''[[Ostpolitik]]'', which included the ''de facto'' acceptance of Germany's territorial losses in World War II.

During the summer of 1989, in the face of a growing migration of East Germans to West Germany via [[Hungary]] and mass demonstrations, East German authorities unexpectedly eased the border restrictions in November 1989, allowing East German citizens to travel to the West. This led to the acceleration of the process of reforms in East Germany that concluded with [[German reunification]] on [[October 3]] [[1990]]. Under the terms of the treaty between West and East Germany, Berlin again became the capital of the reunited Germany. 

Since reunification, Germany has taken a leading role in the [[European Union]] and [[NATO]]. Germany sent a peacekeeping force to secure stability in the [[1999 NATO bombing in Yugoslavia|Balkans]] and sent a force of [[Bundeswehr]] troops to [[Afghanistan]] as part of a NATO effort to provide security in that country after the ousting of the [[Taliban]].<ref name="ARM">Dempsey, Judy.

==Government==
[[Image:Reichstag2006.JPG|thumb|210px|The [[Reichstag (building)|Reichstag]] is the old and new site of the German parliament.]]
{{main|Politics of Germany}}
Germany is a [[Federal republic|federal]], [[parliamentary democratic|parliamentary]], [[Representative democracy|representative]] [[Democracy|democratic]] [[republic]]. The German political system operates under a framework laid out in the 1949 [[Constitution|constitutional document]] known as the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|Grundgesetz]] ("[[Basic Law]]"). Amendments to the Grundgesetz require a two-thirds majority of both chambers of parliament; the articles guaranteeing fundamental rights, a democratic state, and the right to resist attempts to overthrow the constitution are valid in perpetuity and cannot be amended.<ref>[http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/gg/art_79.html Article 79 of the ''Grundgesetz'']</ref> The Grundgesetz remained in effect, with minor amendments, after [[German reunification]] in 1990, despite the intention of the Grundgesetz to be replaced by a proper constitution after the reunion. (Which was called Grundgesetz for precisely this reason.) 

The [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] is the [[head of government]] and exercises [[Executive (government)|executive power]]. Federal [[legislative power]] is vested in the [[parliament]] consisting of the ''[[Bundestag]]'' ("[[Diet (assembly)|Federal Diet]]") and ''[[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]]'' ("[[Federal Council]]"), which together form a unique type of legislative body. The ''Bundestag'' is elected through [[direct election]]s; the members of the ''Bundesrat'' represent the governments of the [[States of Germany|sixteen federal states]] and are members of the state cabinets, which appoint them and can remove them at any time.

[[Image:Kanzler21a.jpg|170px|thumb|left|The ''[[German Chancellery|Bundeskanzleramt]]'' has been the seat of the German Chancellor since 2001.]]
Since 1949, the party system has been dominated by the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]] and the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]]<ref>[http://countrystudies.us/germany/159.htm Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union] U.S. Library of Congress. Retrieved [[2006]], [[December 7|12-07]].</ref> although smaller parties, such as the liberal [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (which has had members in the Bundestag since 1949) and the [[Alliance '90/The Greens]] (which has controlled seats in parliament since 1983) have also played important roles.

The German [[head of state]] is the [[President of Germany]], elected by the ''[[Bundesversammlung (Germany)|Bundesversammlung]]'' ("federal convention"), an institution consisting of the members of the ''Bundestag'' and an equal number of state delegates. The second highest official in the [[German order of precedence]] is the [[President of the Bundestag|President of the ''Bundestag'']], who is elected by the ''Bundestag'' itself. He or she is responsible for overseeing the daily sessions of the body. The third-highest official and the [[head of government]] is the [[Chancellor]]. He or she is nominated by the President of Germany and elected by the ''Bundestag''. If necessary, he or she can be removed by a constructive [[motion of no confidence]] by the ''Bundestag'', where "constructive" implies that the ''Bundestag'' needs to elect a successor.

==Legal system==
[[Image:Karlsruhe bundesverfassungsgericht.jpg|right|200px|thumb|The [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany]] in [[Karlsruhe]].]]
{{main|Judiciary of Germany}}
The [[Judiciary of Germany]] is independent of the executive and the legislative branches. Germany has a [[civil law (legal system)|civil or statute law system]] that is based on [[Roman law]] with some references to [[Germanic law]]. Legislative power is divided between the Federation and the individual federated states. [[Criminal law]] and [[private law]] are codified on the national level in the ''[[Strafgesetzbuch]]'' and the ''[[B<U+00FC>rgerliches Gesetzbuch]]'' respectively. Many of the fundamental matters in [[administrative law]] remain in the jurisdiction of the individual federated states, though most states follow the 1976 ''Verwaltungsverfahrensgesetz'' (Administrative Proceedings Law) in important points of administrative law. Germany's supreme court system is specialized. For civil and criminal cases, the highest court of appeal is the [[Federal Court of Justice of Germany|''Bundesgerichtshof'']] (Federal Court of Justice), located in [[Karlsruhe]]. The courtroom style is [[Inquisitorial system|inquisitorial]]. The  ''[[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany|Bundesverfassungsgericht]]'' (Federal Constitutional Court), also located in Karlsruhe, is the German Supreme Court responsible for constitutional matters, with power of [[judicial review]]. It acts as the highest legal authority and ensures that legislative and judicial practice conforms to the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|Constitution]]. It acts independently of the other state bodies, but cannot act on its own behalf.

==Foreign relations==

{{main|Foreign relations of Germany}}
Germany has played a leading role in the [[European Union]] since its inception and has maintained a [[Franco-German cooperation|strong alliance with France]] since the end of World War II. The alliance was especially close in the late 1980s and early 1990s under the leadership of [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democrat]] [[Helmut Kohl]] and [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist]] [[Fran<U+00E7>ois Mitterrand]].

Military Service is compulsory for men at the age of 18, and conscripts serve nine-month tours of duty (conscientious objectors may instead opt for an equal length of ''[[Zivildienst]]'' (roughly translated as civilian service), or a longer commitment to (voluntary) emergency services like a [[Volunteer fire department|fire department]], the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]] or the [[Technisches Hilfswerk|THW]]). In 2003, military spending constituted 1.5% of the country's [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]].<ref name="CIA"/> In peacetime, the Bundeswehr is commanded by the Minister of Defence, currently [[Franz Josef Jung]].

{{main|Geography of Germany}}
Germany has the second largest population in Europe (after European Russia) and is seventh largest in area. The territory of Germany covers [[1 E11 m<U+00B2>|357,021]]&nbsp;[[square kilometre]]s (137,850&nbsp;[[Square mile|sq&nbsp;mi]]), consisting of 349,223&nbsp;square kilometres (134,835&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) of land and 7,798&nbsp;square kilometres (3,010&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) of water. Elevation ranges from the mountains of the [[Alps]] (highest point: the [[Zugspitze]] at 2,962&nbsp;metres (9,718&nbsp;[[Foot (unit of length)|ft]])) in the south to the shores of the [[North Sea]] (Nordsee) in the north-west and the [[Baltic Sea]] (Ostsee) in the north-east. Between lie the forested uplands of central Germany and the low-lying lands of northern Germany (lowest point: [[Wilstermarsch]] at 3.54 metres (11.6&nbsp;ft) below sea level), traversed by some of Europe's major [[river]]s such as the [[Rhine]], [[Danube]] and [[Elbe]].<ref name="CIA">[https://www.odci.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/gm.html Germany] CIA Factbook. November 14, 2006. Retrieved [[2006]], [[November 29|11-29]].</ref> Because of its central location, Germany shares borders with more European countries than any other country on the continent. Its neighbours are [[Denmark]] in the north, [[Poland]] and the [[Czech Republic]] in the east, [[Austria]] and [[Switzerland]] in the south, [[France]] and [[Luxembourg]] in the south-west and [[Belgium]] and the [[Netherlands]] in the north-west.

[[Image:Hintersee.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Alps|Alpine]] scenery in southern [[Bavaria]].]]
Most of Germany has a cool, temperate climate in which humid westerly winds predominate. The climate is moderated by the [[North Atlantic Current|North Atlantic Drift]], which is the northern extension of the [[Gulf Stream]]. This warmer water affects the areas bordering the [[North Sea]] including the peninsula of [[Jutland]] in north Germany and the area along the [[Rhine]], which flows into the [[North Sea]]. Consequently in the north-west and the north, the climate is [[Oceanic climate|oceanic]]; [[Precipitation (meteorology)|rainfall]] occurs year round with a maximum during summer. [[Winter]]s there are mild and [[summer]]s tend to be cool, though temperatures can exceed 30&nbsp;<U+00B0>[[Celsius|C]] (86&nbsp;<U+00B0>[[Fahrenheit|F]]) for prolonged periods. In the east, the climate is more [[continental climate|continental]]; winters can be very cold, summers can be very warm, and long dry periods are often recorded. Central and southern Germany are transition regions which vary from moderately oceanic to continental. Again, the maximum temperature can exceed 30&nbsp;<U+00B0>C (86&nbsp;<U+00B0>F) in summer.<ref>[http://www.handbuch-deutschland.de/book/en/002_001_001.html German Climate] Handbuch Deutschland.

Responsibility for educational oversight in Germany lies primarily with the [[States of Germany|federal states]] individually whilst the government only has a minor role. <!--Kulturhoheit--> Optional [[kindergarten]] education is provided for all children between three and six years old, after which school attendance is [[Compulsory education|compulsory]] for at least ten years.

In order to enter a university, high school students are required to take the [[Abitur]] examination, however students possessing a diploma from a vocational school may also apply to enter. A special system of apprenticeship called ''Duale Ausbildung'' allows pupils in vocational training to learn in a company as well as in a state-run school.<ref name="ED"/> Although Germany has had a history of a strong educational system, recent [[Programme for International Student Assessment|PISA student assessments]] demonstrated a weakness in certain subjects. A test of thirty-one countries in 2000 ranked Germany twenty-first in reading and twentieth in both [[mathematics]] and the [[natural sciences]], prompting calls for reform.<ref>[http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,2259935,00.html Experts: Germany Needs to Step up School Reforms] Deutsche Welle.

==Culture==

{{main|Culture of Germany|Sport in Germany|Science and technology in Germany}}
Germany is often called ''das Land der Dichter und Denker'' (the land of poets and thinkers).<ref>Wasser, Jeremy.

Retrieved [[2006]], [[December 6|12-06]].</ref> German culture began long before the rise of Germany as a [[nation-state]] and spanned the entire German speaking world. From its roots, culture in Germany has been shaped by major intellectual and popular currents in Europe, both religious and secular. As a result, it is difficult to identify a specific German tradition separated from the larger context of European [[high culture]].<ref>[http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761576917_4/Germany.html Federal Republic of Germany: Culture.] Encarta Online Encyclopedia 2006. Retrieved [[2007]], [[January 2|01-02]].</ref> German literature can be traced back to the Middle Ages and the works of writers such as [[Walther von der Vogelweide]] and [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]]. Various German authors and poets have won great renown, including [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] and [[Friedrich Schiller]]. The collections of folk tales published by the [[Brothers Grimm]] popularized German folklore on the international level. Germany's [[German philosophy|influence on philosophy]] is historically significant and many notable German philosophers have helped shape [[western philosophy]] since the Middle Ages. [[Gottfried Leibniz]]'s contributions to [[rationalism]], [[Immanuel Kant]]'s establishment of [[German idealism]], [[Karl Marx]]'s formulation of [[Communist theory]], and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s development of [[Perspectivism]] were especially influential.

[[Image:Beethoven.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Ludwig van Beethoven]] ([[1770]]<U+2013>[[1827]]).]]
Germany claims some of the world's most renowned [[classical music]] composers, including [[Ludwig van Beethoven]], [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]. As of 2006, Germany is the fifth largest music market in the world<ref>[http://p2pnet.net/story/1167 Music market worth $US32 billion] P2pnet.net Apr. 7, 2004. Retrieved [[2006]], [[December 7|12-07]].</ref> and has influenced [[Pop music|pop]] and [[rock music]] through artists such as [[Kraftwerk]] or [[Rammstein]]. Numerous German painters have enjoyed international prestige through their work in diverse artistic currents. [[Matthias Gr<U+00FC>newald]] and [[Albrecht D<U+00FC>rer]] were important artists of the [[Renaissance]], [[Caspar David Friedrich]] of [[Romanticism]], and [[Max Ernst]] of [[Surrealism]]. [[Architecture|Architectural]] contributions from Germany include the [[Carolingian architecture|Carolingian]] and [[Ottonian architecture|Ottonian styles]], which were important precursors of [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]]. The region later became the site for significant works in styles such as [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]], [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] and [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]]. Germany was particularly important in the early [[modern architecture|modern movement]], especially through the [[Bauhaus]] movement founded by [[Walter Gropius]]. German cinema dates back to the very early years of the medium with the work of [[Max Skladanowsky]]. It was particularly influential during the years of the [[Weimar Republic]] with [[German expressionism|German expressionists]] such as [[Robert Wiene]] and [[Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau]]. [[New German Cinema]] directors such as [[Volker Schl<U+00F6>ndorff]] and [[Werner Herzog]], and films such as ''[[Good Bye Lenin!]]'' (2003) have enjoyed international success.
