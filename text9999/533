'''Ronald Marc George''' (born March 11, 1940) is the retired 27th [[Chief Justice of California]], where he headed the [[Supreme Court of California]] and the [[Judicial Council of California]].  [[Governor of California|Governor]] [[Pete Wilson]] appointed George as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court in 1991 and elevated George to Chief Justice in 1996.<ref name="OfficialBio">{{cite web| url=http://www.courts.ca.gov/5763.htm|title=Chief Justice Ronald M. George|publisher=[[Judicial Council of California]]|accessdate=June 14, 2011}}</ref>

==Education and early career==
A 1957 graduate of [[Beverly Hills High School]],<ref name="LATimes">{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1997/oct/29/news/mn-47895|title=Fighting for a people's court|publisher=''[[Los Angeles Times]]''|last=Dolan|first=Maura|date=October 29, 1997|page=A1}}</ref> George earned his [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] from [[Princeton University]] in 1961 and his [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] from [[Stanford Law School]] in 1964.<ref name="OfficialBio" /><ref name="LATimes" />

Upon graduating from Stanford, George was a Deputy California Attorney General from 1965<U+2013>1972.<ref name="OfficialBio" />  As a Deputy Attorney General, he argued unsuccessfully on behalf of the State of California before the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] in ''[[Chimel v. California]]'' in 1969.<ref name="OfficialBio" /> The following year, he again represented California before the U.S. Supreme Court, this time successfully defending the [[capital punishment in the United States|death penalty]] in ''[[McGautha v. California]]''.<ref name="OfficialBio" />  In 1971, he represented California as an [[amicus curiae]] in support of the successful argument of the State of Illinois in ''[[Kirby v. Illinois]]''.<ref name="OfficialBio" />

In 1972, his final year as a Deputy Attorney General, George unsuccessfully argued in favor of the [[capital punishment in California|death penalty]] before the [[Supreme Court of California|California Supreme Court]] in ''[[California v. Anderson]]'' but was successful in defending the conviction of [[Sirhan Sirhan]] in the [[assassination of Robert F. Kennedy]], a [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] and [[United States presidential election, 1968|1968 presidential candidate]].<ref name="OfficialBio" />  The ruling in ''California v. Anderson'' resulted in the dismissal of ''[[Aikens v. California]]'' as moot; George was to have represented the State of California in this case.<ref name="OfficialBio" />

==Early judicial career==
Governor [[Ronald Reagan]] appointed George as a Judge of the Los Angeles Municipal Court on April 20, 1972.  George was elected to a full six-year term on November 2, 1976.<ref name="OfficialBio" /><ref name="LATimes" />  Governor [[Jerry Brown]] appointed him to the [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]] [[Superior Courts of California|Superior Court]] on December 23, 1977; George was elected to a full six-year term on November 7, 1978, and re-elected on November 6, 1984.<ref name="OfficialBio" /><ref name="LATimes" />

As a Superior Court judge, George presided over the trial of [[Hillside Strangler]] [[Angelo Buono, Jr.|Angelo Buono]] in 1981<U+2013>1983.<ref name="OfficialBio" /><ref name="LATimes" /> George was lauded for his extremely unusual decision to deny the motion by [[Los Angeles County District Attorney]]'s office to dismiss all 10 counts of [[murder]] against Buono.<ref name="LATimes" />  However, his unusual decision was speculated to be a result of his earlier decision to separate crucial counts of rape and sodomy, which in themselves would serve as evidence against the defendant, from the murder charges.<ref name="LATimes" /> The prosecutors felt the evidence against Buono was so weak that it did not justify even an attempt to win at trial.<ref name="LATimes" />  Judges rarely second-guess the prosecutors' judgment on such a matter (and George stated that he was "loath" to do so).<ref name="LATimes" />  However, George's review of the evidence in the case caused him to feel so strongly that the prosecutors were in error that he did exactly that.<ref name="LATimes" />  George reassigned the case to the [[California Attorney General]]'s office, and that office successfully convicted Buono on nine of the 10 counts.<ref name="LATimes" /> Thus, it was recognized that the judge, through his action to deny the earlier [[motion to dismiss]], had ultimately prevented a [[serial killer]] from going free.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jul/16/opinion/la-ed-george-20100716|title=Justice George's legacy|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=July 16, 2010}}</ref>  Oddly, Los Angeles County District Attorney [[John Van de Kamp]] had been elected California Attorney General in the middle of the lengthy trial, so a Van de Kamp-led District Attorney's office attempted to dismiss the unwinnable case only to have a Van de Kamp-led Attorney General's office win nine convictions in the case.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.sfgate.com/1998-03-22/opinion/17716691_1_buono-s-cousin-kenneth-bianchi-hillside-stranglers-kamp/2|title=True Justice|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=March 22, 1998|last=Saunders|first=Debra J.|authorlink=Debra Saunders|page=2}}</ref>

Governor [[George Deukmejian]] appointed him to the [[California Courts of Appeal|California Second District Court of Appeal]] on July 23, 1987.  George was confirmed and sworn in on August 27, 1987, and was elected to a full twelve-year term on November 6, 1990.<ref name="OfficialBio" /><ref name="LATimes" />

==Supreme Court==
Governor [[Pete Wilson]] appointed George to the [[Supreme Court of California|California Supreme Court]] on July 29, 1991.<ref name="OfficialBio" />  George was confirmed and sworn in as an Associate Justice on September 3, 1991.<ref name="OfficialBio" />  California voters elected him to a full twelve-year term on November 8, 1994.<ref name="OfficialBio" />  Wilson appointed George as the 27th [[Chief Justice of California]] on March 28, 1996.<ref name="OfficialBio" />  George was confirmed and sworn into office on May 1, 1996.<ref name="OfficialBio" />  He was elected to a full twelve-year term on November 3, 1998, with 75.5% percent of the vote.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vote98.sos.ca.gov/Final/sov/SOV98.pdf|title=Statement of Vote - General Election November 3, 1998|publisher=[[California Secretary of State]]|date=December 12, 1998|page=21|accessdate=June 14, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smartvoter.org/1998nov/ca/state/race/supct/|title=California State Government - November 3, 1998 General - California Supreme Court|publisher=Smart Voter Project of the [[League of Women Voters]]|date=February 16, 1999|accessdate=June 14, 2011}}</ref>

George was occasionally floated as a candidate for justice of the [[United States Supreme Court]] as a conservative acceptable to [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]], such as when Democratic [[United States Senator]] [[Barbara Boxer]] suggested George as a potential nominee for the seat on the Court vacated by [[Sandra Day O'Connor]]'s retirement.  Boxer described both George and his fellow California Supreme Court Justice [[Kathryn Werdegar]], as Republicans who "reflect the spirit of Sandra Day O'Connor's tenure{{mdash}}independent and nonideological."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2005-07-13/news/17382630_1_bush-appellate-court-nominees-white-house-senators-from-both-parties|title=Bush asks senators for advice on court pick|date=July 13, 2005|publisher=''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]''|last=Lochhead|first=Carolyn}}</ref>

In 2008, George authored the opinion in the Supreme Court's 4-3 ruling in ''[[In re Marriage Cases]]'' legalizing [[same-sex marriage in California]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/05/15/BAGAVNC5K.DTL|title=State's top court strikes down marriage ban|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=May 16, 2008|last=Egelko|first=Bob}}</ref>  Citing the court's [[Perez v.
