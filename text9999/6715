{{nihongo|'''Matsuo Bash<U+014D>'''|<U+677E><U+5C3E> <U+82AD><U+8549>||extra=[[1644]]<U+2014>[[28 November]] [[1694]]}} was the most famous [[poet]] of the  [[Edo period]] in [[Japan]]. During his lifetime, Bash<U+014D> was renowned for his works in the collaborative ''[[renga|haikai no renga]]'' form; today, he is recognized as a master of brief and clear [[haiku]].

==Early life==
[[Image:MatsuoBasyoSeika.jpg|thumb|left|Bash<U+014D>'s supposed birthplace in [[Iga Province]].]]

Bash<U+014D> was born '''Matsuo Kinsaku''' in roughly 1644, somewhere near [[Ueno, Mie|Ueno]] in [[Iga Province]]. His father may have been a low-ranking samurai, which would have promised Bash<U+014D> a career in the military but not much chance of a notable life. However, in his childhood Bash<U+014D> became a servant to T<U+014D>d<U+014D> Yoshitada, who shared with Bash<U+014D> a love for ''[[haikai]]'', a sort of cooperative poetry that began with the 5-7-5 syllable format (now known as haiku) and continued with a 7-7 addition by another poet. Both T<U+014D>d<U+014D> and Bash<U+014D> gave themselves ''haigo'', or ''haikai'' [[pen name]]s; Bash<U+014D>'s was S<U+014D>b<U+014D>, and he was also given the samurai name of '''Matsuo Munefusa'''. In 1662 the first extant poem by Bash<U+014D> was published; in 1664 two of his hokku were printed in a compilation, and in 1665 Bash<U+014D> and Yoshitada composed a one-hundred-verse ''renku'' with some acquaintances.

Unfortunately, Yoshitada's sudden death in 1666 brought Bash<U+014D>'s peaceful life as a servant to an end. No records of this time remain, but it is believed that Bash<U+014D> gave up the possibility of samurai status and left his home. Biographers have proposed various reasons and destinations, including the fanciful possibility of an affair between Bash<U+014D> and a Shinto [[miko]] named Jutei. Bash<U+014D>'s own references to this time are utterly vague; he recalled that "at one time I coveted an official post with a tenure of land", and that "there was a time when I was fascinated with the ways of homosexual love", but there is no indication whether he was referring to real obsessions or even fictional ones. He was even conflicted over whether to become a full-time poet; by his own account, "the alternatives battled in my mind and made my life restless." In any case, his poems continued to be published in anthologies in 1667, 1669, and 1671, and he published his own compilation of various authors, {{nihongo|''Seashell Game''|<U+8C9D><U+304A><U+307B><U+3072>|Kai <U+014C>i}}, in 1672. In roughly the spring of that year he moved to [[Edo]] to further his study of poetry.

==Rise to fame==

In Edo, Bash<U+014D>'s poetry was quickly recognized for its simple and natural style. He gave himself the ''haigo'' of T<U+014D>sei and by 1680 he had a full-time job teaching twenty disciples who published {{nihongo|''The Best Poems of T<U+014D>sei's Twenty Disciples''|<U+6843><U+9752><U+9580><U+5F1F><U+72EC><U+541F><U+4E8C><U+5341><U+6B4C><U+4ED9>|T<U+014D>sei-montei Dokugin-Nijukasen}}, advertising their connection to T<U+014D>sei's talent. That winter, his disciples built him a rustic hut and planted a {{nihongo|banana tree|<U+82AD><U+8549>|bash<U+014D>}} in the yard, giving Bash<U+014D> a new ''haigo'' and his first permanent home. He wrote ''hokku'' in tribute to the [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]]:

:''kabitan mo / tsukubawasekeri / kimi ga haru''
::the Dutchmen, too, / kneel before His Lordship-- / spring under His reign. [1678]

With this success, however, grew dissatisfaction and loneliness. He began practicing [[Zen]] [[meditation]] but apparently it did not soothe his fears. In the winter of 1682 the hut burned down, and his mother died early in 1683. He then travelled to [[Yamura]] to stay with a friend. In the winter of 1683 his disciples gave him a second hut in Edo, but his spirits did not improve. Instead, after publishing another compilation, {{nihongo|''Shrivelled Chestnuts''|<U+865A><U+6817>|Minashiguri}}, he left Edo in 1684 on the first of four major aimless wanderings.

Travelling in medieval Japan was immensely dangerous, and at first Bash<U+014D> expected to simply die in the middle of nowhere or be killed by bandits. As the trip progressed, his mood improved and he became comfortable on the road. He met many friends and grew to enjoy the changing scenery and the seasons. His poems took on a less introspective and more striking tone as he observed the world around him:

:''uma wo sae / nagamuru yuki no / ashita kana''
::even a horse / arrests my eyes--on this / snowy morrow [1684]

The trip took him from Edo to [[Mount Fuji]] to Ueno and [[Kyoto]]. He met several poets who called themselves his disciples and wanted his advice; he told them to disregard the contemporary Edo style and even his own ''Shrivelled Chestnuts'', saying it contained "many verses that are not worth discussing." He returned to Edo in the summer of 1685, taking time along the way to write more ''hokku'' and comment on his own life:

:''toshi kurenu / kasa kite waraji / hakingara''
::another year is gone / a traveller's shade on my head, / straw sandals at my feet [1685]

When Bash<U+014D> returned to Edo he happily resumed his job as a teacher of poetry at his Bash<U+014D> Hut, although privately he was already making plans for another journey. The poems from his journey were published as {{nihongo|''Account of a Weather-beaten Skeleton''|<U+91CE><U+3056><U+3089><U+3057><U+7D00><U+884C>|Nozarashi kik<U+014D>}}. In early 1686 he composed one of his best-remembered ''hokku'':

:''furuike ya / kawazu tobikomu / mizu no oto''
::the old pond / a frog jumps in-- / water's sound [1686]

Apparently this poem became instantly famous: by April the poets of Edo gathered at the Bash<U+014D> Hut for a ''haikai no renga'' contest on the subject of frogs that seems to have been a tribute to Bash<U+014D>'s ''hokku'', which was placed at the top of the compilation. Bash<U+014D> stayed in Edo, continuing to teach and hold contests, with an excursion in the autumn of 1687 when he travelled to the countryside for [[tsukimi|moon watching]], and a longer trip in 1688 when he returned to Ueno to celebrate the Lunar New Year. As long as he stayed in his eponymous hut, Bash<U+014D> would constantly be worrying about inviting over too many visitors and his perceived "idleness". At the same time, he enjoyed his life and had a subtle sense of humor, as reflected in his ''hokku'':

:''iza saraba / yukimi ni korobu / tokoromade''
::now then, let's go out / to enjoy the snow... until / I slip and fall! [1688]

==''Oku no Hosomichi''==
{{mainarticle|Oku no Hosomichi}}

Bash<U+014D>'s private planning for another long journey culminated on [[16 May]] [[1689]], when he left with his student Kawai Sora on a trip to the Northern Provinces. Bash<U+014D> and Sora headed north to [[Hiraizumi]], which they reached on June 29. They then walked to the western side of the country, touring [[Kisakata]] on July 30, and began hiking back at a leisurely pace along the coastline. He completed the log of his journey, {{nihongo|''The Narrow Road to Oku''|<U+5965><U+306E><U+7D30><U+9053>|Oku no Hosomichi}}, in 1694. It is often considered his finest achievement, including ''hokku'' such as:

:''araumi ya / Sado ni yokotau / amanogawa''
::The rough sea / stretching out towards Sado / the Milky Way (1689)

Bash<U+014D>, with his apprentice Kawai Sora, started his journey from Edo on [[May 16]], [[1689]], or [[Genroku]] 2, May 27. He traveled a total of 600 ''[[Japanese units of measurement#Length|ri]]'', or 2400 kilometers, in 150 days, walking in the northeastern areas of Japan, and came back to [[Edo]] in 1691. By the time he came to [[Oogaki]], [[Gifu]], he had completed ''Oku no Hosomichi''.

==Later life==

In the winter of 1691, Bash<U+014D> returned to Edo to live in his third Bash<U+014D> hut, again provided by his disciples. This time, he was not alone; he took in a nephew and his female friend, Jutei, who were both recovering from illness. He had a great many visitors.

[[Image:MatsuoBasho-Haka-M1932.jpg|thumb|right|Bash<U+014D>'s grave in [[Otsu, Shiga|<U+014C>tsu, Shiga Prefecture]].]]
Bash<U+014D> continued to be uneasy with his job. He wrote to a friend that "disturbed by others, I have no peace of mind". He continued to make a living from teaching and appearances at ''haikai'' parties until late August of 1693, when he shut the gate to his Bash<U+014D> Hut and refused to see anybody for a month. Finally, he relented after adopting the principle of ''karumi'' or "lightness", a semi-Buddhist philosophy of greeting the mundane world rather than separating himself from it. Bash<U+014D> left Kyoto for the last time in the summer of 1694, and spent time in Ueno and Kyoto before coming to Osaka. He became sick with a stomach illness and died peacefully, surrounded by his disciples.

==Influence and literary criticism==
Rather than sticking to the formula of {{nihongo|[[kigo]]|<U+5B63><U+8A9E>|}} which remains popular in Japan even today, Bash<U+014D> aspired to reflect real human emotion in his ''hokku''. Even during his lifetime, the effort and style of his poetry was widely appreciated; after his death, it only increased. Several of his students compiled quotations from him about his own poetry, most notably Mukai Kyorai and Hattori Doh<U+014D>. 

During the 18th century, appreciation of Bash<U+014D>'s poems grew more fervent, and commentators such as Ishiko Sekisui and Moro Nanimaru went to great length to find references in his ''hokku'' to historical events, medieval books, and other poems. These commentators were often lavish in their praise of Bash<U+014D>'s obscure references, some of which were probably literary [[false cognate]]s. In 1793, Bash<U+014D> was deified by the Shinto bureaucracy, and for a time criticizing his poetry was literally blasphemous.

It was not until the late 19th century that this period of unanimous passion for Bash<U+014D>'s poems came to an end. [[Masaoka Shiki]], arguably Bash<U+014D>'s most famous critic, tore down the long-standing orthodoxy with his bold and candid objections to Bash<U+014D>'s style. However, Shiki was also instrumental in making Bash<U+014D>'s poetry accessible to leading intellectuals and the Japanese public at large. He invented the term [[haiku]] (replacing ''hokku'') to refer to the freestanding 5-7-5 form which he considered the most artistic and desirable part of the ''haikai no renga''.

Critical interpretation of Bash<U+014D>'s poems continued into the 20th century, with notable works by Yamamoto Kenkichi, Imoto N<U+014D>ichi, and Ogata Tsutomu. The 20th century also saw translations of Bash<U+014D>'s poems into languages and editions around the world.

==Trivia==
* One of the most famous hokku attributed to Bash<U+014D> (''Matsushimaya Aa Matsushimaya Matsushimaya'', extolling the wordless beauty of [[Matsushima]] Bay) was actually written by a late Edo period poet, [[Tawarabo]].

* A haiku by Bash<U+014D> is quoted by the main character in [[Teddy (story)|"Teddy"]], a short story by [[J. D. Salinger]].

* Several haiku by Bash<U+014D> are quoted in [[Ian Fleming]]'s novel ''[[You Only Live Twice]]''.

* 1960's musician Robbie Basho, who released many album's on John Fahey's famed Takoma record label, was brought up Daniel R. Robinson by his adopted parents. Upon discovering the poetry of Matsuo Bash<U+014D> he decided to change his name to [[Robbie Basho]]. The current German guitar player [[Steffen Basho-Junghans]] incorporated the Basho into his name after becoming interested in the poetry of Matsuo Bash<U+014D> through the music of Robbie Basho.
