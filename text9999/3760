[[Image:Arc Triomphe.jpg|thumb|250px|The ''Arc de Triomphe'' at night]]
The '''Arc de Triomphe''' is a monument in [[Paris]], [[France]] that stands in the centre of the Place [[Charles de Gaulle]], also known as the [[Place de l'<U+00C9>toile]].<ref>The "Star" is formed by the radiating avenues.</ref> It is at the western end of the [[Champs-<U+00C9>lys<U+00E9>es]]. The [[triumphal arch]] honors those who fought for France, particularly during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. On the inside and the top of the arc there are all of the names of generals and wars fought. Underneath is the tomb of the unknown soldier from World War I . 

The Arc is the linchpin of the historic axis (''L'[[Axe historique]]'') <U+2014> a sequence of monuments and grand thoroughfares on a route which goes from the courtyard of the [[Louvre]] Palace to the outskirts of Paris. The monument was designed by [[Jean Chalgrin]] in 1806, and its [[Iconography|Iconographic]] program pitted heroically [[Depictions of nudity|nude]] French youths against bearded [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] warriors in [[mail (armour)|chain mail]] and set the tone for public monuments, with triumphant nationalistic messages, until [[World War I]]. 

The monument stands  {{Convert|49.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} in height, {{Convert|45|m|ft|abbr=on}} wide and {{Convert|22|m|ft|abbr=on}} deep. It is the second largest [[triumphal arch]] in existence.<ref>[[North Korea]] built a [[Arch of Triumph (Pyongyang)|slightly larger Arch of Triumph]] in 1982 for the 70th birthday of [[Kim Il-Sung]].</ref> Its design was inspired by the Roman [[Arch of Titus]]. The Arc de Triomphe is so colossal that three weeks after the Paris victory parade in 1919, marking the end of hostilities in World War I, Charles [[Godefroy]] flew his [[Nieuport]] biplane through it, with the event captured in a newsreel.<ref>Melville Wallace, ''La vie d'un Pilote de Chasse en 1914<U+2013>1918'', 1978.

==History==
[[Image:Ribart Elephant triomphal.jpg|thumb|There was a pre-Napoleonic (1758) proposal by [[Charles Ribart]] for an elephant-shaped building on the location of the current arch.]]
The Arc de Triomphe is one of the most famous monuments in Paris. Forms the backdrop for an impressive urban ensemble in Paris. The monument surmounts the hill of Chaillot at the center of a star-shaped configuration of 12 radiating avenues. It was commissioned in 1806 after the victory at [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]] by [[Napoleon I of France|Emperor Napoleon]] at the peak of his fortunes. Laying the foundations alone took two years, and in 1810 when Napoleon entered Paris from the west with his bride Archduchess [[Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma|Marie-Louise]] of Austria, he had a wooden mock-up of the completed arch constructed. The architect Jean Chalgrin died in 1811, and the work was taken over by [[Jean-Nicolas Huyot]]. During the [[Bourbon Dynasty, Restored|Restoration]], construction was halted and would not be completed until the reign of [[Louis-Philippe of France|King Louis-Philippe]], in 1833<U+2013>36 when the architects on site were Goust, then Huyot, under the direction of [[Louis-<U+00C9>tienne H<U+00E9>ricart de Thury|H<U+00E9>ricart de Thury]]. Napoleon's body passed under it on 15 December 1840 on its way to its second and final resting place at [[Les Invalides]].<ref>[http://www.paris.org/Musees/Invalides/ Hotel des Invalides website]</ref> 

===The design=== 
Since the fall of Napoleon (1815), the sculpture representing ''Peace'' is   interpreted as commemorating the ''Peace of 1815''.
[[Image:lamarseillaise.500px.jpg|thumb|left|Cast of the head of a figure from [[Fran<U+00E7>ois Rude]]'s sculpture "La Marseillaise"]]
The [[astylar]] design is by [[Jean Chalgrin]] (1739<U+2013>1811), in the [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] version of ancient [[Roman architecture]]. Major [[academy|academic]] sculptors of France are represented in the sculpture of the Arc de Triomphe: [[Jean-Pierre Cortot|Corhtot]]; [[Fran<U+00E7>ois Rude|Rude]]; [[Antoine <U+00C9>tex|<U+00C9>tex]]; [[James Pradier|Pradier]] and [[Philippe Joseph Henri Lemaire|Lemaire]]. The main sculptures are not integral [[frieze]]s but are treated as independent trophies applied to the vast [[ashlar]] masonry masses, not unlike the gilt-bronze [[appliqu<U+00E9>]]s on [[Empire (style)|Empire furniture]]. The four sculptural groups at the base of the Arc are ''The Triumph of 1810'' ([[Jean-Pierre Cortot]]), ''Resistance'' and ''Peace'' (both by [[Antoine <U+00C9>tex]]) and the most renowned of them all, ''Departure of the Volunteers of '92'' commonly called ''[[La Marseillaise]]'' ([[Fran<U+00E7>ois Rude]]). The face of the allegorical representation of France calling forth her people on this last was used as the belt buckle for the seven-star rank of [[Marshal of France]].
 
In the attic above the richly sculptured frieze of soldiers are 30 shields engraved with the names of major [[French Revolutionary Wars|Revolutionary]] and [[Napoleonic Wars|Napoleonic military victories]]. (The [[Battle of Fuentes de Onoro]] is described as a French victory, instead of the narrow defeat actually suffered). The inside walls of the monument list the names of 558 French generals;<ref> Among the generals is one foreign general, [[Francisco de Miranda]].</ref> the names of those who died in battle are underlined. Also inscribed, on the shorter sides of the four supporting columns, are the names of the major battles of the Napoleonic Wars. The battles which took place in the period between the departure of Napoleon from [[Elba]] and his final defeat at [[Waterloo, Belgium|Waterloo]] are not included.

===Les "Grandes Guerres"===

The sword carried by the ''Republic'' in the ''Marseillaise'' relief broke off, on the day, it is said, that the [[Battle of Verdun]] began in 1916. The relief was immediately hidden by [[Tarpaulin|tarpaulins]] to conceal the accident and avoid any undesired ominous interpretations. Famous victory marches past the Arc have included the [[German Empire|Germans]] in 1871, the French in 1918, the [[Occupation of France by Nazi Germany|Germans]] in 1940,<ref> [http://www.worldwariimuseum.com/Images2005/03Arc01lg.gif Image of Nazi parade]</ref>, and the [[Liberation of Paris|French and Allies]] in 1944<ref> [http://pictopia.com/perl/get_image?size=457x275_mb&provider_id=38&ptp_photo_id=79689 Image of Liberation of Paris parade]</ref> and 1945. [[Charles de Gaulle]] survived an attack upon him at the Arc de Triomphe during a parade.

===The Unknown Soldier===

[[Image:UStankParis-edit1.jpg|thumb|An American [[M8 Greyhound|M8 armored scout car]] marches in front of the Arc de Triomphe at the "[[Liberation of Paris|Liberation Day]]" parade.]]   
Beneath the Arc is the [[Tomb of the Unknown Soldier]] from the [[World War I|First World War]]. Interred here on [[Armistice Day]] 1920, it has the first [[eternal flame]] lit in Western and Eastern Europe since the [[Vestal Virgin]]s' fire was extinguished in the year [[394]]. It burns in memory of the dead who were never identified (now in both World Wars). The french model inspired [[United Kingdom]]'s tomb of [[The Unknown Warrior]] in [[Westminster Abbey]]. A ceremony is held there every 11 November on the anniversary of the [[Armistice with Germany (Compi<U+00E8>gne)|armistice]] signed between France and Germany in 1918. It was originally decided in 12 November 1919 to bury the unknown soldier's remains in the [[Panth<U+00E9>on, Paris|Panth<U+00E9>on]], but a public letter-writing campaign led to the decision to bury him beneath the Arc. The coffin was put in the chapel on the first floor of the Arc on 10 November 1920, and put in its final resting place on 28 January 1921. The slab on top carries the inscription <small>ICI REPOSE UN SOLDAT FRAN<U+00C7>AIS MORT POUR LA PATRIE 1914<U+2013>1918</small> ("Here lies a French soldier who died for his fatherland 1914<U+2013>1918").

In 1961, President [[John F. Kennedy]] and First Lady [[Jacqueline Kennedy]] of the United States paid their respects at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, accompanied by French President de Gaulle. After the 1963 [[John F. Kennedy assassination|assassination of President Kennedy]], Mrs. Kennedy remembered the eternal flame at the Arc de Triomphe and requested that an eternal flame be placed next to her husband's grave at [[Arlington National Cemetery]] in Virginia. President de Gaulle went to Washington to attend the state funeral, and he was able to witness Jacqueline Kennedy lighting the eternal flame that was inspired by her visit to France. 

By the early 1960s the monument had grown very blackened from coal soot and automobile exhaust, and during 1965<U+2013>1966 the Arc de Triomphe was thoroughly cleaned through [[bleaching]]. By 2007 some darkening was again apparent. The arc is planned to be bleached again in 2011.{{Fact|date=May 2008}}
