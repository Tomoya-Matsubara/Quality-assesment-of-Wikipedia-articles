The '''[[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] D-21''' was a [[Mach number|Mach]] 3+ [[reconnaissance]] [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|drone]].  The drone was originally designed to be launched off the back of its [[Lockheed A-12]]-based M-21 aircraft.  Development began in October 1962.  Originally known by the Lockheed designation Q-12, it was intended for reconnaissance missions deep into enemy airspace.  

The D-21 was designed to carry a single high-resolution photographic camera over a pre-programmed path, then release the camera module into the air for retrieval, followed by the drone's self-destruction.<ref name=Donald>Donald, pp. 154<U+2013>56.</ref> Following a fatal accident when launched from a M-21, the D-21 was modified to be launched from a [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress]]. Only four operational D-21 flights were made over the [[People's Republic of China]] before the program was canceled in 1971.

==Design and development==
In the early 1960s, Lockheed had developed the Mach 3 [[Lockheed A-12|A-12]] reconnaissance aircraft for the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]. After the [[U-2 Crisis of 1960|downing]] of [[Gary Powers]]' [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]] in 1960, a number of different concepts were proposed as alternatives. [[Clarence Johnson|Kelly Johnson]], in charge of Lockheed's secret [[Skunk Works]] that had built the A-12, developed the concept of a long-range drone that used much of the technology as the A-12. In October 1962, the CIA and the [[United States Air Force|US Air Force]] instructed Lockheed to study a high-speed, high-altitude drone concept. Kelly Johnson specified speeds of Mach 3.3<U+2013>3.5, an operational altitude of {{convert|87000|-|95000|ft|m}} and a range of {{convert|3000|nmi|lk=on}}. It was intended to make a one-way trip and eject its camera payload at the end of the mission for recovery before self-destructing.<ref name=gg6>Goodall and Goodall, p. 106.</ref> The Q-12 had a double-[[delta wing]] similar to the A-12's wing design. The Q-12 was to be air-launched from the back of an A-12, and used key technology from the A-12 project, including [[titanium]] construction and employed similar measures to reduce its [[radar cross-section]].<ref name=Pace_p55/>

Kelly Johnson wanted to power the Q-12 with a [[ramjet]] engine built by [[Marquardt Corporation|Marquardt]] for the [[Boeing]] [[Bomarc Missile Program|BOMARC]] long-range [[surface-to-air missile]]. Marquardt and Lockheed had already collaborated on several programs and had a close working relationship. The engine, the RJ43-MA-11, could be be used, but it needed a lot of work since it was only designed to burn as long as a BOMARC needed to hit a target. In contrast, the Q-12's engine needed to operate for at least an hour and a half and operate at high altitudes. These conditions required extensive modifications to allow the engine to work at the high temperatures and low pressures of the Q-12's flight profile. The modified engine was designated as the RJ43-MA20S-4.<ref name=gg6/>

[[File:M-21 Rear.jpg|thumb|left|Rear view of the D-21/M-21 combination on the ground, showing the exhaust shroud used on early flights.]]

A full-scale mockup of the Q-12 was ready by 7 December 1962 and had already undergone preliminary tests to measure its radar cross-section. Marquardt had also successfully tested the modified RJ-43 in its [[wind tunnel]] in the meantime.<ref>Goodall and Goodall, pp. 106<U+2013>107.</ref> However, the CIA was not enthusiastic about the Q-12, mostly because the agency was overextended at the time with U-2 missions, getting the A-12 up to speed, and covert operations in Southeast Asia. In contrast, the Air Force was interested in the Q-12 as both a reconnaissance platform and a cruise missile, and the CIA finally decided to work with the USAF to develop the new drone. Lockheed was awarded a contract in March 1963 for full-scale development of the Q-12.<ref name=Pace_p55>Pace, p. 55.</ref>

The [[camera]], its [[Camera magazine|film magazines]], and [[inertial navigation system]] were carried in a cramped "Q-bay" below the drone's air [[intake]]. These systems were built into a module that fit into the bay and was known as a "hatch". The hatch would be ejected at the end of the mission and it would be snagged out of the air by a [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules|JC-130 Hercules]], a technique that had been developed by the Air Force to recover film canisters from satellites. If the C-130 missed, the hatch was equipped with flotation devices so it could be recovered by ship. [[Honeywell]] built the [[avionics]] systems; new construction techniques and materials had to be developed for the systems to withstand the high temperatures, extreme vibrations, and lack of space in the D-21.<ref>Goodall and Goodall, pp. 112<U+2013>114.</ref>

In late 1963, the project was named "Tagboard"; the Q-12 was re-designated D-21 while the A-12 version became M-21 (D- for "daughter" and M- for "mother").  Two of the original 18 A-12 aircraft were designated as M-21s, serial numbers 60-6940, and -6941. The M-21 was a two-seat version of the A-12, with a pylon on the fuselage centerline between the [[vertical stabilizer]]s to carry the drone in a nose-up attitude.<ref>Goodall and Goodall, p. 107.</ref>

===Change in D-21 carriers===
[[File:B-52 with D-21.jpg|thumb|right|A modified D-21 carried on the wing of a B-52.]]

Due to safety concerns with launching the D-21 from the M-21, the drone switched carriers to the [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress]].<ref name=Landis_p25-6/> The drone was modified by adding attachment points on its spine to mate with the carrying pylon on the B-52 and its belly attachment points were adapted to accommodate the rocket booster necessary to increase the drone's speed to a speed where its ramjet could operate. Its vertical stabilizer was increased in size by about 20%. The modified drone version was designated ''D-21B'', although there was no ''-21A'' version. Two B-52Hs were modified to carry a pair of drones each by means of two large underwing pylons that replaced the smaller pylons used for the [[AGM-28 Hound Dog]] [[cruise missile]]s. The B-52's [[tail gunner]]'s and [[electronic warfare]] officer's stations were replaced with two launch control stations. Command and [[telemetry]] systems were added, and high-speed cameras were installed to track the drones as they separated from the pylons. The B-52Hs could communicate with the D-21Bs, which had remote control links so that the Launch Control Officer (LCO) could order it to self-destruct if necessary.<ref>Goodall and Goodall, pp. 109, 113, 117.</ref>

The [[solid-fuel rocket|solid-fuel booster]] was both larger and heavier than the drone; it was {{convert|44|ft|4|in|m|sigfig=3}} long and weighed {{convert|13286|lb|kg|sigfig=3}}. It had a folding [[tail fin]] on the bottom to stabilize it while while the rocket was firing. The booster had a burn time of 87 seconds, and a thrust of {{convert|27300|lbf|kN}}.<ref>Peebles, p. 127.</ref> During ground handling, everybody within {{convert|25|ft|m|sigfig=2}} were required to wear anti-static straps to prevent any [[electrostatic discharge|discharge of static electricity]] from igniting the booster.<ref>Goodall and Goodall, pp. 115<U+2013>116.</ref>

== Operational history ==
=== Testing ===
[[File:LockheedM21-D21.jpg|thumb|right|M-21 carrying D-21 in flight]]

The M-21/D-21 combination began captive flight-testing on 22 December 1964. [[Aerodynamic]] covers were initially placed over the D-21's intake and exhaust to reduce [[drag (physics)|drag]], but had to be removed after the first few tests, as a method of discarding them at Mach 3 without damaging the M-21 and/or D-21 could not be devised.<ref>Goodall and Goodall, p. 109.</ref>  

The D-21 was first successfully launched from a M-21 on 5 March 1966.<ref>Donald 2003, p. 155.</ref> The drone was released successfully, but stayed close to the M-21's back for a few seconds, which seemed like "two hours" to the M-21 crew.<ref>Peebles, p. 125</ref> A second successful launch took place on 27 April 1966, with the D-21 reaching its operational altitude of 90,000 feet (27,400 m) and speed of over Mach 3.3, though it was lost due to a hydraulic pump failure after a flight of over {{convert|1200|nmi|km|lk=on}}.  The Air Force's interest in the program continued and more D-21s were ordered after the second launch.<ref>Donald 2003, p. 155.</ref>  A third successful flight took place on 16 June, with the D-21 flying {{convert|1550|nmi|km}} through its complete flight profile, though its camera hatch was not released due to an electronics failure.<ref name=gg8>Goodall and Goodall, p. 108.</ref>

The fourth and final launch from a M-21 on 30 July ended in disaster. Unlike the three previous launches this one was performed straight and level, not in an [[outside loop]] to assist in the separation of the drone from the aircraft. The D-21 suffered engine problems and struck the M-21's tail immediately after separation, which led to the destruction of both aircraft. The two crew ejected, and landed at sea. The pilot, Bill Park, survived, but the LCO, Ray Torick, drowned.<ref name=gg8/><ref name=Landis_p24-5>Landis and Jenkins, pp. 24<U+2013>25.</ref>

[[File:D-21 Booster Launch.jpg|thumb|left|A D-21B being launched, illustrating the size of the booster relative to the drone.]]

Following the accident, Johnson suggested launching the D-21 from a larger aircraft, the B-52, and adding a solid rocket booster to get it up to speed.<ref name=Landis_p25-6>Landis and Jenkins, pp. 25<U+2013>26.</ref>  The first attempted launch of a D-21B was on 28 September 1967, but the drone accidentally fell off the B-52's launch pylon due to a stripped nut on the pylon before the aircraft reached its intended launch point. Johnson admitted that the incident was "very embarrassing". Three more launches were performed from November 1967 through January 1968. None were completely successful, so Johnson ordered his team to conduct a thorough review before renewing launch attempts.<ref>Peebles, p. 129</ref> The next launch was on 10 April 1968, and was also a failure because the engine did not ignite. On 16 June, the D-21B finally made a completely successful flight as it flew at the specified altitude and course for its full range and the hatch was recovered successfully.<ref name=gg18>Goodall and Goodall, p. 118.</ref> The next two launches were failures, however, but were followed by another successful flight in December. A test in February 1969 that tested the inertial navigation system with an actual mission profile was a failure, but the next two flights, in May and July, were both successes.<ref>Miller, p. 141.</ref>

=== Operations ===
[[File:B-52 with two D-21s.jpg|thumb|right|The same B-52 photographed from farther away, showing both drones.]]

Four operational missions with the D-21B took place under the codename of ''Senior Bowl''.  These were conducted over the People's Republic of China from 9 November 1969 to 20 March 1971 to spy on the [[Lop Nor]] nuclear test site.  The USAF's 4200th Support Squadron, based at [[Beale Air Force Base]], California flew the missions, usually from [[Andersen Air Force Base]] in [[Guam]].<ref>Goodall and Goodall, pp. 112, 118.</ref>

The Chinese never spotted the D-21B, but it failed to turn around and continued straight, crashing somewhere in the Soviet Union.<ref name=CIA_513A>{{cite web |url=http://www.lazygranch.com/images/cia/jac/jac37s.jp2 |title=Interview with James A. Cunningham, Jr. (Director of Development Projects Division) |publisher=CIA |date= 1983-10-04}}</ref> Another test flight was conducted on 20 February 1970 in a successful attempt to correct any problems. The second operational mission, however, was not until 16 December 1970. The D-21B made it all the way to Lop Nor and back to the recovery point, but the hatch had a partial parachute failure and was lost at sea.<ref name=gg18/>  

During the third operational mission, on 4 March 1971 the D-21B flew to Lop Nor and returned, jettisoning the hatch. It deployed its parachute, but the midair recovery failed. The [[destroyer]] that tried to retrieve the hatch from the water ran it down and it sank. The fourth, and last, flight of the D-21B was on 20 March 1971. It was lost over China on the final segment of the route.<ref>Peebles, p. 131.</ref>

[[File:D21-070308.jpg|thumb|right|D-21 on display at the Blackbird Airpark, Air Force [[Plant 42]], [[Palmdale, California]]]]

On 23 July 1971, the D-21B program was canceled, due to a combination of the poor level of success and the introduction of a new generation of photo reconnaissance [[satellites]], as well as President [[Richard Nixon]]'s rapprochement with China.<ref>Peebles, pp. 133<U+2013>34.</ref>  A total of 38 D-21/D-21B drones were built with 21 expended in launches. The remaining 17 were initially stored at [[Norton Air Force Base]], California then moved to [[Davis-Monthan Air Force Base]] "boneyard" near [[Tucson, Arizona]]<ref name=Landis_p28>Landis and Jenkins, p. 28.</ref> in 1976 and 1977. Since the base is open to the public, the D-21 drones were quickly spotted and photographed. The Air Force called them GTD-21Bs with the GT standing for Ground Training.<ref>Peebles, p. 132.</ref>

The fate of the D-21 that had disappeared on the first operational flight was finally revealed in February 1986 when an official from the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] returned a panel to [[Ben Rich]] that he had been given by a Soviet [[KGB]] agent. The drone had self-destructed over Siberia and the Soviets had recovered the wreckage.<ref>Peebles, p. 134.</ref> The [[Tupolev]] design bureau reverse-engineered the wreck and came up with plans for a Soviet copy, named the "Voron (Raven)", but it was never built.<ref>Gordon and Rigamant, pp. 325<U+2013>27.</ref>

In the late 1990s, [[NASA]] considered using a D-21 to test a hybrid "rocket-based combined cycle" engine, which operates as a ramjet or rocket, depending on its flight regime. This idea was abandoned with NASA preferring to use a derivative of the agency's [[NASA X-43|X-43A]] hypersonic test vehicle for the experiments.<ref>Landis and Jenkins, pp. 28<U+2013>29</ref>
