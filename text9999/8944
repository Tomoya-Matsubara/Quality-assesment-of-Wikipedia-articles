[[File:Wilbrahams Almshouses Welsh Row Nantwich2.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Tollemache Almshouses, 118<U+2013>128 Welsh Row, [[Nantwich]]]]
The '''Tollemache Almshouses''', also known as the '''Wilbraham Almshouses''' or '''Wilbraham's Almshouses''', are six former [[almshouse]]s in [[Nantwich]], [[Cheshire]], England. They are in two blocks of three cottages each, located on the north side of [[Welsh Row, Nantwich|Welsh Row]] at numbers 118<U+2013>128 (at {{gbmappingsmall|SJ6442852469}}). The present buildings, which are listed at [[listed building|grade II]],<ref name=IoE>{{NHLE |num= 1249725|desc= Wilbraham's Almshouses, Nantwich|accessdate= 11 August 2012}}</ref> were erected in 1870 by [[John Tollemache, 1st Baron Tollemache|John Tollemache]] (later created first [[Baron Tollemache]]) to replace [[Wilbraham's Almshouses, Nantwich|adjacent almshouses]] founded by [[Roger Wilbraham|Sir Roger Wilbraham]] in 1613. The almshouses were modernised in 1980 and remain in residential use. The [[Hospital of St Lawrence, Acton|Hospital of St Lawrence]], a [[medieval]] house for [[leprosy|lepers]], was possibly on or near the site of the present almshouses.

[[Nikolaus Pevsner]] considers Welsh Row "the best street of Nantwich".<ref name=Pevsner>Pevsner, p. 289</ref> The street has many listed buildings and is known for its mixture of architectural styles,<ref>Bavington ''et al''., plate 55</ref> including [[Timber framing|timber-framed]] black-and-white cottages such as the Wilbraham's and [[Widows' Almshouses, Nantwich|Widows' Almshouses]], [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] town houses such as [[Townwell House, Nantwich|Townwell House]] and [[83 Welsh Row, Nantwich|number 83]], and Victorian buildings such as the former [[Nantwich Grammar School#New Grammar School: 108 Welsh Row|Grammar School]], [[Primitive Methodist Chapel, Nantwich|Primitive Methodist Chapel]] and [[39 Welsh Row, Nantwich|Savings Bank]].

==Hospital of St Lawrence==
{{main|Hospital of St Lawrence, Acton}}
The Tollemache Almshouses might be located on or near the site of the Hospital of St Lawrence, a [[medieval]] house for [[leprosy|lepers]] whose date of foundation is unknown; it became a hospital for the infirm poor in around 1348. The hospital is known to have been situated well outside the medieval town of Nantwich within the parish of [[Acton, Cheshire|Acton]], by the western entrance to the town on what is now Welsh Row. Although associated with an area adjacent to the old almshouses by [[Joseph Partridge (historian)|Joseph Partridge]], author of the first history of Nantwich, there is little or no direct evidence as to its precise location.<ref>Hall, pp. 53<U+2013>54</ref><ref name=Lamberton>Lamberton & Gray, p. 12</ref><ref name=Garton_Saxon>Garton 1972, pp. 8<U+2013>9</ref><ref name=Garton_Tudor>Garton 1983, p. 13</ref>

==Wilbraham's Almshouses==

{{main|Wilbraham's Almshouses, Nantwich}}
In 1613, [[Roger Wilbraham|Sir Roger Wilbraham]] of [[Dorfold Hall]] founded [[almshouse]]s for six poor men at what was then the end of [[Welsh Row, Nantwich|Welsh Row]] (later The Maltkilns at numbers 112<U+2013>116); they were the town's earliest almshouses.<ref name=Hall>Hall, pp. 249, 358, 379</ref> Wilbraham's Almshouses were maintained by the Wilbraham family until 1692, when responsibility for them passed into the Tollemache family because of the earlier marriage of Grace Wilbraham, the Wilbraham heiress, to [[Lionel Tollemache, 3rd Earl of Dysart|Lionel Tollemache]], the third [[Earl of Dysart]].<ref name=Blacklay>Blacklay, pp. 33<U+2013>35</ref><ref>Hall, p. 21</ref>

==History of present almshouses==
The present almshouses were built in 1870 by [[John Tollemache, 1st Baron Tollemache|John Tollemache]], a descendant of Sir Roger Wilbraham, to replace the Wilbraham's Almshouses which stood adjacent.<ref name=Hall /><ref name=Blacklay /> Tollemache, of [[Peckforton Castle]] and [[Helmingham Hall]], [[Suffolk]], served successively as the Member of Parliament for [[South Cheshire (UK Parliament constituency)|South]] and [[West Cheshire (UK Parliament constituency)|West Cheshire]], and was created the first [[Baron Tollemache]] in 1876. He was the largest landowner in Cheshire; in addition to the almshouses, he built more than fifty farmhouses and many cottages, and also donated the land for the Nantwich Market Hall.<ref name=Hall /><ref name=durdey>{{citation |author =Durdey R |year =2007<U+2013>2008 |title =John Tollemache and his Castle |journal =Cheshire History |volume = 47 |pages =75<U+2013>87 |issn =0141-8696}}</ref>

The Tollemache Almshouses stand immediately adjacent to the Wilbraham's Almshouses, and were built on their gardens, at what was then the end of Welsh Row. Like the earlier almshouses, they accommodated six men; four were from Nantwich and two from the neighbouring village of [[Acton, Cheshire|Acton]].<ref name=Hall /><ref name=Kellys_1892>''Kelly's Directory'' (1892)</ref> In the 1880s, the inhabitants were old married men; their widows were allowed to remain provided that they "conduct themselves properly."<ref name=Hall /> Historian James Hall describes the almshouses at that time as "comfortable dwellings of two stories, with their gardens in front" which were "an ornament to the west end of the town".<ref name=Hall /> In 1892, the total annual endowment of the original charity was <U+00A3>12. The almsmen each received 10 [[Shilling (British coin)|shillings]] quarterly, a pair of shoes annually and <U+00A3>1 4s 6d every two years for other clothing from the Tollemache family. Additionally, increases in the original endowment by bequests from Peter Sprout and from Elizabeth and Mary Bennion, respectively, resulted in an extra <U+00A3>2 per head plus a share of <U+00A3>21 10s annually.<ref name=Hall /><ref name=Kellys_1892 /> According to a scheme dated 23 June 1870, the single trustee of the Wilbraham Almshouse Charity was John Tollemache, who selected the almsmen; the Tollemache family continued to maintain the almshouses until 1978.<ref name=Blacklay /><ref name=Kellys_1892 />

In 1975, the almshouses were self-supporting, with a total annual income from maintenance contributions of just over <U+00A3>700, in addition to <U+00A3>18.30 from the Tollemache estate at [[Peckforton]] and <U+00A3>20 from the charity established by the Bennions.<ref name=Blacklay /> (The contribution from the Peter Sprout charity had ceased before 1939.<ref>''Kelly's Directory'' (1939)</ref>) On 21 March 1978, a few years after the death of [[Major John Tollemache, 4th Baron Tollemache|Major John Tollemache]], fourth Baron Tollemache, the administration of the Wilbraham Almshouse Charity passed to the trustees of the Almshouse Charities of Sir Edmund Wright, Crewe and Others, which maintained the [[Wright's Almshouses, Nantwich|Wright's]], [[Crewe Almshouses, Nantwich|Crewe]] and Harriet Hope Almshouses, although the charities remained separate. The almshouses were renovated and modernised starting 3 June 1980, at a total cost of up to <U+00A3>71,500. They were formally reopened on 24 November 1980 by Dinah, Lady Tollemache, widow of Major Tollemache.<ref name=Blacklay />

==Description==
The almshouses are in two identical blocks set well back from the street behind a walled front garden. Each block comprises three red-brick cottages of a single storey plus attics under a tiled roof, with two slightly projecting [[gable]]d end wings. The gables have sham [[timber framing]] and slender [[finial]]s. There are similar finials to the ends of the roof and two prominent clustered chimney stacks.<ref name=IoE />

Each block has three unornamented doorways with arched heads.<ref name=IoE /> Above the central doorway is a cast-iron plaque bearing the [[coat of arms]] of the Tollemache family and the date 1870.<ref name=IoE /><ref>Simpson, plate 117</ref> The ground floor has four [[casement window]]s, one of two lights and three of three lights; there are four two-light casements to the attic floor, two of which are gabled [[dormer]]s. All the windows are [[Latticework|latticed]] in iron with a diamond pattern and have arched heads.<ref name=IoE />

==Modern usage==
The Tollemache Almshouses remain in residential use. They are run as a housing association, administered jointly with the [[Wright's Almshouses, Nantwich|Wright's]], [[Crewe Almshouses, Nantwich|Crewe]] and Harriet Hope Almshouses by the Almshouse Charities of Sir Edmund Wright, Crewe and Others.<ref name=Blacklay />
