===Early years===
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Rudolph Auerbach.jpg|thumb|200px|Mendy Rudolph (left) talking to [[Boston Celtics]] [[head coach]] [[Red Auerbach]] during a 1958 NBA game.]] -->
Rudolph was recommended by [[Eddie Gottlieb]], coach and owner of the NBA's [[Philadelphia Warriors]] at the time, to then-NBA commissioner [[Maurice Podoloff]], after observing Rudolph officiate an exhibition game.<ref name=TimesLeader /><ref name=Jewsinsports />  Rudolph was hired by the NBA in February 1953,<ref name=TimesLeader /> midway through the [[1952-53 NBA season]] and he became the youngest official in the league.<ref name="SusanHOF">{{cite web | title=HOF Speech: Susan on Behalf of Mendy Rudolph | url=http://nba-boss.streamos.com/wmedia/nba/nbacom/hof/hof_rudolph_speech.asx | publisher=[[National Basketball Association]] | format=Windows Media |date=2007-09-08 | accessdate=2007-09-08}}</ref> In his early years with the NBA, Rudolph quickly became an established official as he worked playoff games within his first two years in the league.<ref name=Shots115>{{Cite document | last1 = Strom | first1 = Earl | last2 = Johnson | first2 = Blaine | title = Calling the Shots: My Five Decades in the NBA | publisher = [[Simon and Schuster]] | date = 1990 | pages= 115| isbn = 0-671-66108-6 | postscript = <!--None--> }}</ref>

===Memorable NBA Finals games===
Rudolph officiated the [[1955 NBA Finals]] between the [[Syracuse Nationals]] and [[Fort Wayne Pistons]], which was notable for its actions by fans, fights between players, and attacks on referees.<ref name=1955Finals>{{cite web|title=When the Dust Settled|url=http://www.nba.com/encyclopedia/finals/1955_syracuse_nationals.html|last=Ramsey|first=David|publisher=[[National Basketball Association]]|accessdate=2007-07-31}}</ref>  Game 3 of the series, played in [[Indianapolis, Indiana]], was interrupted by a fan who threw a chair on the floor and ran on the court to protest calls made by Rudolph and referee Arnie Heft.<ref name=1955Finals /> Six years later, he made history by officiating the entire [[1961 NBA Finals]] between the [[Boston Celtics]] and [[St. Louis Hawks]] with his colleague [[Earl Strom]].<ref name=Inducted />

Rudolph and Strom officiated another notable game in the [[1964 NBA Finals]].<ref name=Shots85-86>{{Cite document | last1 = Strom | first1 = Earl | last2 = Johnson | first2 = Blaine | title = Calling the Shots: My Five Decades in the NBA | publisher = [[Simon and Schuster]] | date = 1990 | pages= 85<U+2013>86| isbn = 0-671-66108-6 | postscript = <!--None--> }}</ref>  In Game 5 of the championship series, [[Wilt Chamberlain]], playing for the [[San Francisco Warriors]], knocked out [[Clyde Lovellette]] of the Boston Celtics with a punch.<ref name=Jewsinsports />  Celtics head coach [[Red Auerbach]] stormed onto the court and demanded that Chamberlain be thrown out of the game.<ref name=Jewsinsports />  The latter told Auerbach if he did not "shut up", he would be knocked down to the floor with Lovellette.<ref name=Jewsinsports />  Auerbach countered the threat, "Why don't you pick on somebody your own size."  Rudolph intervened the discussion and told Auerbach, "Red, do you have any other seven-footers who'd like to volunteer?"<ref name=Jewsinsports />

===Head of officials===
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:1973 NBA Case Book.jpg|thumb|left|150px|The 1973 edition of the NBA Case Book written by Rudolph.]] -->
As his career progressed in the league, Rudolph took on responsibilities beyond officiating.  In 1966, he was named ''referee-in-chief'' and worked alongside [[Dolph Schayes]], who was hired as the league's supervisor of officials that year to replace [[Sid Borgia]].<ref name=Shots124-125>{{Cite document | last1 = Strom | first1 = Earl | last2 = Johnson | first2 = Blaine | title = Calling the Shots: My Five Decades in the NBA | publisher = [[Simon and Schuster]] | date = 1990 | pages= 124<U+2013>125| isbn = 0-671-66108-6 | postscript = <!--None--> }}</ref>  In this position, he oversaw areas that pertained to referee mechanics, techniques, and rule interpretations.<ref name=Shots124-125 /> It was in this role that he authored the ''NBA Official<U+2019>s Manual and Case Book''.<ref name=Inducted />

While he served as head of officials, the NBA lost four veteran officials<U+2014>[[Norm Drucker]], Joe Gushue, Earl Strom, and John Vanak to the rival [[American Basketball Association]] (ABA) in 1969 over salary and benefits.<ref name=Shots132-140>{{Cite document | last1 = Strom | first1 = Earl | last2 = Johnson | first2 = Blaine | title = Calling the Shots: My Five Decades in the NBA | publisher = [[Simon and Schuster]] | date = 1990 | pages= 132<U+2013>140| isbn = 0-671-66108-6 | postscript = <!--None--> }}</ref>  At the time of transaction, Rudolph told Strom, "(Deputy Commissioner) Carl [Scheer], (NBA Commissioner) [[Walter Kennedy (NBA)|Walter]] [Kennedy], and I were prepared to offer you guys the greatest contract in the history of pro basketball."<ref name=Shots132-140 />

By the early 1970s, Rudolph successfully encouraged the league to adopt a plain gray referee uniform over the traditional "zebra" shirt to de-emphasize the presence of officials in games.<ref name=Shots167>{{Cite document | last1 = Strom | first1 = Earl | last2 = Johnson | first2 = Blaine | title = Calling the Shots: My Five Decades in the NBA | publisher = [[Simon and Schuster]] | date = 1990 | pages= 167| isbn = 0-671-66108-6 | postscript = <!--None--> }}</ref>

===Final years===
By 1975, Rudolph's health condition began to deteriorate and he was forced to retire after suffering a [[blood clot]] in his lung during a [[1975 NBA Playoffs|1975 NBA playoff]] game between the [[Buffalo Braves]] and [[Washington Bullets]], played April 25, 1975.<ref name=TimesLeader />  In his final game, he had to be carried off the court.<ref name=Interview />  On November 9, 1975, Rudolph officially ended his career as a referee in the NBA, in which he officiated more games (2,113) than any official in league history at the time.<ref name=date>{{cite web|title=This Date in History-November|url=http://www.nba.com/history/this_date_november.html|publisher=[[National Basketball Association]]|accessdate=2007-07-31}}</ref>  Earl Strom later broke Rudolph<U+2019>s record and officiated over 2,400 games in his 30-year career.<ref name=date />

==Post-officiating career==
===Broadcasting===
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Mendy Rudolph CBS.jpg|thumb|200px|Rudolph as a television analyst for [[CBS Sports]] coverage of the [[1976 NBA Finals]].]] -->
Following his officiating career, Rudolph transitioned to a career in [[broadcasting]].  During the [[1975<U+2013>76 NBA season|1975-76]] and [[1976-77 NBA season]]s, he worked as a [[color commentator|television analyst]] for [[CBS Sports]] covering ''[[The NBA on CBS]]''.<ref name=tapes>{{cite web|title=Old Time Radio Shows|url=http://www-unix.oit.umass.edu/~ahmintz/sports-video.htm|accessdate=2007-07-31}}</ref>  During his first season, he was paired with [[Brent Musburger]] and [[Rick Barry]] for the [[1976 NBA Finals]].<ref name=tapes />  This championship series was most memorable for a triple-[[overtime (sports)|overtime]] Game 5, which has been labeled the "greatest game" in NBA history.<ref name=76Finals>{{cite web|title=Greatest Game Ever|url=http://www.nba.com/suns/history/greatestgame_azcentral.html|last=Young|first=Bob|publisher=''[[The Arizona Republic]]''|date=2001-06-03|accessdate=2007-07-30}}</ref>  In this game, Celtic [[John Havlicek]] made an apparent game-winning [[Field goal (basketball)|field goal]] at the conclusion of the second overtime.<ref name=AskMen>{{cite web|title=Top 10: NBA Finals Matchups|url=http://www.askmen.com/sports/fitness_top_ten_100/105_fitness_list.html|last=Golokhov|first=Dave|publisher=[[AskMen.com]]|accessdate=2007-08-04}}</ref>  The game clock had expired, but Rudolph, along with Musburger and Barry, noted that the shot was made with two seconds remaining.<ref name=AskMen />  Referee [[Richie Powers]], however, decided that one second remained in the second overtime period.<ref name=76Finals />

===Television commercial===
In 1976, Rudolph was featured in a [[Miller Brewing Company]] [[television advertisement]] along with then-Celtics head coach [[Tom Heinsohn]] to promote [[Miller Lite]]'s "Tastes Great, Less Filling" [[advertising campaign]].<ref name=beerad>{{cite web|title=View 50 years of the greatest and some of the funniest Beer TV Commercials from the USA|url=http://www.beertvads.com/|accessdate=2007-07-29}}</ref> Rudolph and Heinsohn debated whether Miller Lite was less filling or tastes great in a bar room scene. After Heinsohn refused to agree that Lite was, first and foremost, less filling, Rudolph threw his thumb in the air and screamed, "You're out of the bar."<ref name=beerad /><ref name=Deford>{{cite web|title=Would anyone in the U.S. visit a referee hall of fame?|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2005/writers/frank_deford/09/20/refs/index.html|last=Deford|first=Frank|authorlink=Frank Deford|publisher=[[CNN Sports Illustrated]]|date=2005-09-21|accessdate=2007-07-30}}</ref>  This advertisement popularized Miller's campaign slogan<ref name=beerad /> and the campaign was named eighth best of the 20th century by ''[[Advertising Age]]'' in 1999.<ref name=AdAge>{{cite web|title=TOP 100 ADVERTISING CAMPAIGNS|url=http://www.adage.com/century/campaigns.html|publisher=''[[Advertising Age]]''|date=1999|accessdate=2007-08-05}}</ref>

Known for his charisma, personality, and iconic stature on the court, Rudolph symbolized NBA officiating during the early years of the NBA to fans of professional basketball<ref name=HOF /> and became the most recognizable official during the NBA's first four decades.<ref name=Fitzpatrick />  [[Bob Ryan]] of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' said of Rudolph, "If any man other than Red Auerbach ever earned the title of NBA institution, it was certainly Mendy Rudolph."<ref name="SusanHOF" />  Upon retirement, he set a precedent for the standards that future referees are judged.<ref name=HOF />  Early in his officiating career, [[Joe Crawford]] (later hired by the NBA in 1977) attended games that Rudolph worked in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]] and studied his style and approach.<ref name=Crawford>{{cite news|title=NBA referee is whistling a different tune|url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/sports/3489787.html|last=Blinebury|first=Fran|publisher=''[[Houston Chronicle]]''|date=2005-11-28|accessdate=2007-07-31}}</ref>  Earl Strom credited Rudolph for being an influence on the development of his career in the NBA.<ref name=Shots114-115>{{Cite document | last1 = Strom | first1 = Earl | last2 = Johnson | first2 = Blaine | title = Calling the Shots: My Five Decades in the NBA | publisher = [[Simon and Schuster]] | date = 1990 | pages= 114<U+2013>115| isbn = 0-671-66108-6 | postscript = <!--None--> }}</ref>  In his [[autobiography]], ''Calling the Shots'', Strom described Rudolph as "one of the most prominent referees because of his style, courage, and judgment.

Strom was also an advocate to get Rudolph enshrined into the Basketball Hall of Fame.<ref name=Jewsinsports />  On April 2, 2007, Rudolph was announced as one of the seven members of the Basketball Hall of Fame's Class of 2007 to be enshrined in September 2007,<ref name=Inducted>{{cite news|title=Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame Announces Class of 2007|url=http://www.nba.com/news/hof_announcement_070402.html|publisher=[[National Basketball Association]]|date=2007-04-02|accessdate=2007-07-29}}</ref> twenty-eight years after his death.
