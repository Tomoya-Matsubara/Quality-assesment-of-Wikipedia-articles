'''Maryland Route 159 (MD 159)''' is a [[state highway]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Maryland]].  The route runs {{convert|4.73|mi|km|abbr=on}} from a dead end at [[Bush River (Maryland)|Bush River]] near Perryman north to [[U.S. Route 40 in Maryland|U.S. Route 40]] in [[Aberdeen, Maryland|Aberdeen]].

==Route description==
Maryland Route 159 begins at a dead end at [[Bush River (Maryland)|Bush River]], an estuary that flows into [[Chesapeake Bay]], as Perryman Road, a two-lane road through a forested area with a speed limit of {{convert|30|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}.  The road parallels the [[Amtrak Northeast Corridor]] railroad tracks as it passes Clubhouse Road, where the speed limit increases to {{convert|50|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, and Forest Greens Road, which provides access to Forest Greens Country Club.  As MD 159 passes Canning House Road, the road heads away from the railroad tracks.  The speed limit drops to {{convert|30|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} as the road enters the village center of [[Perryman, Maryland|Perryman]], where the route encounters Michaelsville Road.  A left turn at a [[stop sign]] at Chelsea Road, which branches to the south, is required to remain on MD 159.

After the intersection with Chelsea Road, MD 159 enters an area of scattered residences with several entrances to [[distribution centers]].  After passing Spesutia Road and the Aberdeen Fire Department, the speed limit increases to {{convert|45|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}.  After passing Cranberry Road, another left turn is required to continue on MD 159 when it meets Old Philadelphia Road at a stop sign.  Old Philadelphia Road is an old alignment of [[Maryland Route 7]] and, before that, [[U.S. Route 40 in Maryland|U.S. Route 40]].  Shortly after the turn onto Old Philadelphia Road, MD 159 ends at U.S. 40.  Old Philadelphia Road continues on the other side of the intersection as MD 7.

==History==
The Perryman Road section of Maryland Route 159 was paved to Perryman by 1930 and completed to Bush River by 1933.<ref name="1930 map">{{cite web|author=[[Maryland State Highway Administration]]|url=http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Maryland_State_Highway_Map_-_1930.jpg|title=Map of Maryland|year=1930|format=JPG|accessdate=2009-12-31}}</ref><ref name="1933 map">{{cite web|author=[[Maryland State Highway Administration]]|url=http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Maryland_State_Highway_Map_-_1933.pdf|title=Map of Maryland|year=1933|format=PDF|accessdate=2009-12-31}}</ref>  The Old Philadelphia Road section was paved by 1927 as it was then U.S. Route 40.<ref name="1927 map">{{cite web|author=[[Maryland State Highway Administration]]|url=http://www.mdhighwaycentennial.com/images/template/gallery/maps/1927SIDE1.jpg|title=Map of Maryland|year=1927|format=JPG|accessdate=2009-12-31}}</ref>  The 1939 Maryland state highway map shows MD 159 following the Perryman Road stretch.<ref name="1939 map">{{cite web|author=[[Maryland State Highway Administration]]|url=http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Maryland_State_Highway_Map_-_1939.pdf|title=Map of Maryland|year=1939|format=PDF|accessdate=2009-12-31}}</ref> The Old Philadelphia Road stretch was MD 7, a number assigned when U.S. 40 was moved to the new Pulaski Highway.  MD 159 replaced MD 7 on that length of Old Philadelphia Road in 1950.<ref name="1950 map">{{cite web|author=[[Maryland State Highway Administration]]|url=http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Maryland_State_Highway_Map_-_1950.pdf|title=Map of Maryland|year=1950|format=PDF|accessdate=2009-12-31}}</ref>
