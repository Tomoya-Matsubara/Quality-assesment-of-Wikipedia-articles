===World Series hero===
The [[1931 World Series]] was a rematch of the previous year's participants, pitting the Cardinals against the [[1931 Philadelphia Athletics season|Philadelphia Athletics]]. Led by [[Connie Mack (baseball)|Connie Mack]], the Athletics had won the previous two World Series and were heavily-favored to win for a third consecutive year.<ref name="The Peppering Of Philly"/> They featured a lineup that included four future [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] members in [[Mickey Cochrane]], [[Jimmie Foxx]], [[Lefty Grove]] and [[Al Simmons]]. 

In Game 1 held at [[Sportsman's Park]] in St. Louis, Martin had three hits, including a [[Double (baseball)|double]], a [[stolen base]] and drove in one run in a 6 to 2 loss to the ace of the Athletics staff, 31-game winner Lefty Grove.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/SLN/SLN193110010.shtml |title=1931 World Series Game 1 |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=15 March 2011 }}</ref> Martin proved to be the difference in Game 2 in what was otherwise a tight pitching duel between [[Bill Hallahan]] and [[George Earnshaw]]. He scored the first [[Run (baseball)|run]] of the game in the second [[Inning (baseball)|inning]] by stretching a [[Single (baseball)|single]] into a double when the ball was bobbled in the outfield, stealing third base, then scoring on a [[sacrifice fly]].<ref name="The Peppering Of Philly"/> Martin added another run in the seventh inning when he hit a single, stole second base, took third base on a [[fielder's choice]], then scored on a [[Squeeze play (baseball)|squeeze bunt]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/SLN/SLN193110020.shtml |title=1931 World Series Game 2 |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=15 March 2011 }}</ref> Those would be the only runs of the game as Hallahan pitched a three-hit [[shutout]] to even the series at one win apiece.<ref name="Pepper Martin post-season batting statistics"/>

The series then moved to [[Shibe Park]] in Philadelphia for Game 3 where, Martin had two hits, including a double and scored twice in a 5-2 Cardinals' victory over Grove.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/PHA/PHA193110050.shtml |title=1931 World Series Game 3 |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=15 March 2011 }}</ref> In Game 4, he produced the only two hits by the Cardinals as they lost to Earnshaw 3 to 0.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/PHA/PHA193110060.shtml |title=1931 World Series Game 4 |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=15 March 2011 }}</ref> Martin almost single-handedly provided the offense for the Cardinals in Game 5, driving home four runs with 2 singles, a home run and a sacrifice fly as, the Cardinals triumphed 5 to 1.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/PHA/PHA193110070.shtml |title=1931 World Series Game 5 |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=15 March 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=One-Man Show Off To St. Louis |agency=Associated Press |work=Spokane Daily Chronicle |page=26 |date=8 October 1931 |accessdate=15 March 2011 |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=XtBXAAAAIBAJ&sjid=y_QDAAAAIBAJ&dq=pepper%20martin&pg=7133%2C2042267}}</ref>

While in a St. Louis hospital in December 1934, for a minor operation on his left arm, Martin insisted that he be entertained by a [[Western music (North America)|cowboy]] musical group that he had hired.

Although Martin had a good year offensively in [[1935 St. Louis Cardinals season|1935]], he continued to struggle defensively at third base.
