{{for|the professional wrestler Mr. Moto|Tor Kamata}}

'''Mr. I. P. Moto''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[Japanese people|Japanese]] secret agent created by the American author [[John P. Marquand]]. Mr. Moto is the original martial arts hero in print and in film. The very un-Japanese name "Moto" seems to be an alias (a part of a Japanese name as in Hashimoto or Yamamoto), and he is better known simply as Mr. Moto. No doubt this was because Marquand was not really familiar with proper Japanese names. Marquand originally created Moto as a very minor character for serial stories published in the [[Saturday Evening Post]]. The popularity of the series, which somehow came to revolve around the "minor" Mr. Moto, encouraged Marquand to keep writing prolifically, especially after the death of [[Charlie Chan]]'s creator, [[Earl Derr Biggers]]. Marquand must have had a prescient feeling about Mr. Moto and the genre. It simply did not exist before he and Biggers created it, and Marquand was deeply involved with each film except the 1962 remake, "Mr. Moto Returns".


== MR. MOTO: THE CHARACTER'S BACKGROUND AND PROFILE ==

One of the most frustrating things for a writer, perhaps, is when his characters are seized for filmdom. J.P. Marquand created a swirl of enigmatic, menacing mist with Mr. I.P. Moto: an Imperial Agent of Japan, serving his emperor blindly and without question. The film version of Mr. Moto is much the same in spirit but very different otherwise; in film, he is "Kentaro Moto", InterPol agent and hero-at-large. In the films, Mr. Moto seems to have a Buddhist priest's background, as evidenced in "Thank You, Mr. Moto".

Agent Moto is typically short (he is often mocked for this in the films) but he's quite strong, and expert in [[judo]] as well as with a gun and other martial arts.  He is the title character in a series of novels, beginning with ''No Hero'' ([[1935]]; British title: ''Mr Moto Takes a Hand'', reprint title: ''Your Turn, Mr. Moto''), and of nine films between 1937 and 1957, in which he was portrayed by [[Peter Lorre]] except for the last film, in which he was played by Henry Silva.  With the beginning of [[World War II]], Mr. Moto fell out of favor, and no new books or movies about him appeared between 1942 and 1957.

"Mr." Moto wears his black hair in a military-style brush cut; he has prominent upper front gold teeth; is pockmarked; requires thick glasses; and he dresses rather oddly at times, apparently having no care about taste or even good fit in suits. When it is required of him, he can certainly dress impressively and correctly (as at diplomatic functions).

Whether a dedicated and cold-blooded spy for Imperial Japan, or a benevolent InterPol agent, Mr. Moto is never a conventional hero. He does not look for opportunities to commit violence but will blithely kill people who must be killed for the greater good; he would not hesitate to take his own life if necessary. He is a master of concealment: while under cover he appears calmly dull, naive, polite and harmless. He does not try to correct the bigoted attitudes of Westerners toward him, and is not above encouraging prejudice if it will serve his mission. All of this seemingly sociopathic behavior serves to camouflage Mr. Moto in the eyes of Westerners-- thus he can work in peace.

The smoothing and altering of Mr. Moto for film was in fact a brilliant inspiration. Were it not for the changes made to the stories and characters, the films would never had been made, let alone successfully realeased through to 1942. The decision to neutralize Moto by making him an InterPol agent, to make him sympathetic by showing a brilliant, sensitive soul, was perfect for the era. People were accustomed to such characters as Fu Manchu and the reality-based "Charlie Chan". If Moto were to survive the silver screen, he would have to "defect" from Japanese Imperialist goals to international detecting/spying.

The films thrill audiences even today-- as do the books.


== ABOUT THE NOVELS ==


Marquand delighted in serials, as each and every Mr. Moto novel originally was. All except ''Mr. Moto's Last Laugh'' (done for "Colliers" Magazine) were serialized in the "Saturday Evening Post". With their great popularity, Marquand saw fit to release an anthology/omnibus, ''Mr. Moto's Three Aces'' (1938), which contained his 2nd, 3rd and 4th novels. This was re-released in 1955. Due to the original titles under which some of the novels were serialized, and later because of the film titles, the lists often cross-pollinate, with a novel landing in the filmography or the occassional films getting listed among the novels (in two particular cases, this is just as well, since Marquand himself wrote them for film: "Mysterious Mr. Moto", 1938, and "Mr. Moto Takes a Vacation", 1939).

The only film for which Marquand did the screenplay was ''Thank You, Mr. Moto'', 1937.

Moto usually appears only at critical points in the novels, the real protagonists being disillusioned expatriate Americans or British men. These central, salt-of-the-earth characters are almost always ex-miltary men, caught up unknowingly in international intrigue. There is always a tantalizing, mysterious lady somewhere in the plot.

Much of the appeal in these stories is the protagonists regaining of ideals, their discovery of new enthusiasm for life. This is incidental to Mr. Moto, who is not primarily concerned with their well-being, though he does not lack in polite affection for them.

It is this starkness and realism that inspired both John Mac Donald and Tom Clancy. The realism, the action, even the ennui stirs the imagination of the reader. Mr. Moto is the most enigmatic and exciting element in this literary tapestry, an indifferent Buddha who comes to the unenthusiastic moral rescue of disenfranchised men and helpless women. Mac Donald, of Travis McGee fame, was moved by Marquand's everyday-style prose; Clancy was inspired by the twists and action.

The last Mr. Moto novel, ''Stopover: Tokyo'' in the mid-1950s, is a considerable departure in style from the books of years before. Now middle-aged and back in Japan working as a senior intelligence official, Moto is caught up in Cold War intrigues, and becomes a somewhat reluctant mentor to American agents as they battle a Soviet espionage ring in Tokyo. Most painful is the fact that Mr. Moto makes one single appearance in this novel, in a purple zoot suit, flashing his gold front teeth in his typical Cheshire Cat grin.

"Stopover: Tokyo" is noticeably darker in tone than earlier Moto works. This time there are no hapless amateurs who get involved with foreign agents, but instead all the main characters are "in the business." According to Marquand biographer Millicent Bell, the novelist knew this might be his last Moto story, and he wanted it to convey some of the actual grimness of spy work. At the end of the story, Mr. Moto blames himself because some things have gone tragically wrong, and he reflects that it may be time to retire. Nevertheless, the story is not an indictment of the immorality of spying or of war. Marquand seems to regard them as necessary evils in an imperfect world. 


== ABOUT THE FILMS and PETER LORRE ==


In the Mr. Moto films, his first name is identified as "Kentaro"-- and with that, they totally altered his character. Moto as played by [[Peter Lorre]]<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000048/]</ref> was not a sociopathic, morally ambiguous Japanese agent, but instead an exotic InterPol agent. Gone are the gold front teeth and somewhat wacky suits: Lorre is impeccably dressed and rather handsome. Even his spectacles are stylish and perfect for the studious part-- the cinematic Mr. Moto speaks several languages perfectly, and is something of a historical scholar.

Many have erroneously used the description "yellowface" in describing Lorre's performances; "yellowface" is the playing of an Asian character by a white actor. Though the term is technically true in Lorre's case, many Japanese were still impressed by his talent and performance even after they learned he was not Japanese.

Unsubstantiated legend holds that Edward G. Robinson was offered this role; perhaps he refused after seeing Warner Oland's Charlie Chan. Ultimately, the job fell to an unlikely actor, one who, as it transpired, was perfect: Peter Lorre. Though requiring a stand-in (identically-sized Mexican stuntman Delmar Costelo)<ref>[http://www.peterlorrebook.com/plphotos4.htm]</ref>, Lorre was able to acquit himself perfectly in his judo scenes.



== The Question of Racism in Mr. Moto ==


This has been raised as a question ever since the Moto films were released, and continues to rage today. The debate of racism in cinema is a field in its own right, covering the blackface of Bing Crosby and Al Jolson, to the redface of countless Indian extras in Westerns, to the yellowface of Peter Lorre and Warner Oland.

There is no question that cinema reflects the racism of the era. In truth, from the beginning of film, filmmakers sought to allocate roles to the correct performers. Only after Herbert Biberman made "Salt of the Earth" using genuine Mexican immigrants did the racial barrier break.

There was much louder outcry in the early 20th century when black, Asian or Indian actors were used-- because they were used in a racially insulting manner. No one today is aware that minorities were so thrilled to work in film that they were prepared to do whatever was asked of them.

Mr. Moto, however, stands out as does Warner Oland's Charlie Chan. These were true-to-life, perfectly acted portrayals, an honor to the characters themselves. Though Chan is based on a minor historical personage, and Moto is not exactly the height of great fiction, they both trail-blazed through the racial undertones in film. Mr. Moto expresses his love of Japan, his emperor, his people and his culture. Furthermore, Mr. Moto in film expresses a general respect for all cultures, and occassionally makes wry observations about Americans that ring true.

Perhaps the only insulting aspect of the Mr. Moto character is the character's own investigation methods. Like his literary counterpart, Mr. Moto on film allows others to dismiss him as slow, dull, underhanded and unethical. Yet it is precisely this that does honor to the chartacter as he reveals who he really is, at the end of the films. It is the issue of a high-ranking ''Japanese'' InterPol agent-- a brilliant one at that-- which pays tribute to the Japanese people.<ref>[http://www.peterlorrebook.com/plphotos4.htm]</ref>


== The Japanese Quality of Lorre's Mr. Moto ==


At 5'5" tall and 130 LBS., Peter Lorre gave such largeness, such depth, to his performance as Mr. Moto- done without makeup of any kind other than standard cinematic makeup- that many who were not familiar with Lorre thought he was at least half Japanese. This included many Japanese who saw the films. Sadly, the modern ear shrinks from the sound of Mr. Moto's voice because of Lorre's pronounced High-German accent. However, this made little difference in the 1930's and 1940's. Aside from his failure to secure a proper Japanese accent (in the novels, Mr. Moto speaks perfect American English), Lorre captured perfectly the Japanese spirit and etiquette with Mr. Moto.

Lorre, who managed to do many of his own stunts, was able to re-darken the Moto character from the considerably lightened scripts. Yet he was also able at times to convey an almost priest-like serenity; some of the films make it clear that Mr. Moto is a devout Buddhist. Lorre himself was very angry at having to play such a role, which he regarded as cheap and unchallenging. He had no idea he would be admired in the future as the first cinema martial arts hero.

Lorre had to be dragged back to complete the final two films in the series, so desperate was he to escape the contract. He had failed to understand the lasting legacy, the new genres, he was helping to create. Though his voice was thick with a German accent (Lorre was a Polish Jew from Austria), he gave an intensity, a realism, to Mr. Moto. Mr. Moto has no inner conflicts; he is an international cop, and he does his job. Yet in the hands of Lorre, Mr. Moto-- who might have turned out a joke much as Sydney Toller did in the role of Charlie Chan-- is one of the greatest roles of all time.

In "Thank You, Mr. Moto", near the end is a scene in which Mr. Moto rushes to help the dying Prince Chung (played by Phillip Ahn). When the prince dies, Mr. Moto assumes the duties of a Japanese Buddhist priest, prays before the statue of the Buddha, uttering the Japanese prayer ''Namo Amida''. (The correct prayer is ''Namo Amida Butsu'', but the fact that Lorre played it so convincingly escaped the current audince. Only today does one appreciate the level of truth Lorre put into the role.) After the death of the prince, a more samurai-like Mr. Moto vows to exact vengeance for the prince and his murdered mother. He then says the prince will be able to meet his ancestors with honor. It is this genuineness, this true-to-life element, that makes Mr. Moto the original, authentic Asian martial arts master character.

In truth, it is sad but typical that an Asian was not picked to play Mr. Moto. Phillip Ahn and Keye Luke were certainly available-- Ahn had a role in "Thank You"-- but it was felt that an Asian could never hold a full part in a film. Witness the equally brilliant casting of the Swedish Warner Oland as Charlie Chan. Though brilliant and equal to Lorre's portrayal, Warner was nevertheless a Caucasian playing an Asian role. "Yellowface" had been established, for better or worse.

Still, in the "Mr. Moto" films we also see the establishment of several sturdy film genres: the mysterious, Gothic foreign spy; the international intrigue of a good spy-mystery; the realism of post-war doldrums and suffering in the everyday person; fine mystery/detective plotting; and finally, the first Asian martial arts "action hero". Nothing like it had been done before, and Mr. Moto should be remembered as the original cinematic martial arts superhero.

In 1957, the film version of ''Stopover: Tokyo'' eliminated Moto's character altogether (not really unexpected considering the social climate). Moto was not indispensible to the story. Few fans know this film was originally a Mr. Moto adventure: it disregards Marquand's plot, and was not a commercial or critical success. In 1962 Mr. Moto's character was briefly (and ridiculously) revived in a low-budget movie starring [[Henry Silva]]. In "Mr. Moto Returns", a.k.a. "The Return of Mr. Moto", the extremely tall Silva conveyed an almost James bond-like playboy character; in the fight scenes he is clearly not proficient in martial arts. He speaks in a lazy Beatnik manner, but in many other ways he is a good portrayal of the original literary Mr. Moto.

== MR. MOTO FILMS ==


As mentioned above, Marquand was prolific in his own way. Deeply involved with the Mr. Moto film series, he managed to adapt one of the novels into a screenplay; acted in several of the films; and wrote original screenplays for two of the films, thus rendering them "Mr. Moto novels" as well.

1. ''[[Think Fast, Mr. Moto]]'' ([[1937]])-- this is Marquand's 3rd novel. He appears in film for the first time.

2. ''[[Thank You, Mr. Moto]]'' ([[1937]])-- Marquand wrote screenplay; this is his 2nd novel.

3. ''[[Mr. Moto's Gamble]]''/a.k.a. "Mr. Moto's Diary" ([[1938]])-- Marquand appears.

4. ''Mr. Moto Takes a Chance'' ([[1938]])-- the original novel, retitled; Marquand appears for the third time in a Mr. Moto film.

5. ''Mysterious Mr. Moto'' ([[1938]])-- this may be considered one of Marquand's novels, since he wrote it especially for filming.

6. ''Mr. Moto's Last Warning'' ([[1939]])-- Marquand appears.

7. ''Mr. Moto on Danger Island|Danger Island'' ([[1939]])-- Marquand appears for the last time in a Moto film.

8. ''Mr. Moto Takes a Vacation'' ([[1939]])-- this is also considered a novel: Marquand wrote this one as well. The last of Peter Lorre and Marquand's involvement in the films.


9. ''The Return of Mr. Moto'' (1962)-- Henry Silva in title role; rumor has it that Marquand wrote the outline for this in order to make up for leaving Mr. Moto out of the film "Stopover: Tokyo". It is merely a rumor. This particualr film is not even worthy of listing with the above, but it does count as a Mr. Moto film.[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0549654/]
