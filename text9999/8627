'''Petersen Rock Garden''', formerly '''Petersen's Rock Garden''' and also known as the '''Petersen Rock Gardens''',<ref name=NWDA>{{Cite web|url=http://nwda.orbiscascade.org/ark:/80444/xv84140|title=Guide to the Farm Home of Rasmus Petersen, Redmond, Oregon, Photograph Album ca. 1940<U+2013>1950|accessdate=May 30, 2013|publisher=[[Northwest Digital Archives]]}}</ref><ref name=Richard>{{Cite news|url=http://blog.oregonlive.com/terryrichard/2009/06/have_rocking_good_time_at_pete.html|title=Have a rocking time at Petersen Rock Gardens|first=Terry|last=Richard|accessdate=May 28, 2013|date=June 8, 2009|work=[[The Oregonian]]|publisher=[[Advance Publications]]|issn=8750-1317|location=Portland, Oregon}}</ref> is a rock garden and museum on {{convert|4|acre}}, located between the cities of [[Bend, Oregon|Bend]] and [[Redmond, Oregon|Redmond]] in [[Deschutes County, Oregon]], United States. Rasmus Petersen, a Danish immigrant who settled in [[Central Oregon]] in the early 1900s, began constructing the garden in 1935 using rocks he found within an {{convert|85|mi|adj=on}} radius of his family home. Petersen constructed detailed miniature castles, churches and other small buildings and monuments from a variety of rock types. He incorporated other design elements such as bridges, water features and [[natural landscaping]]. Petersen worked on the garden until his death in 1952; the garden has remained in his family's care since then. The garden, considered a [[roadside attraction]] with [[novelty architecture]], includes roaming [[peafowl]] and a museum with a gift shop that sells rocks. 

In 2011, Petersen Rock Garden was named one of [[Oregon's Most Endangered Places]] by the [[Historic Preservation League of Oregon]]. In 2012, accidental damage to one of the stone bridges by a contractor catalyzed an effort to document the garden using [[laser scanning]] and other technologies. The garden was closed temporarily in 2013 to undergo repair and review for listing on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. Petersen has been praised for his creative work, and the garden has received a positive reception for its uniqueness and local significance.

The garden is managed and owned by Petersen's granddaughter, Susan Caward, and her family, who has struggled to maintain the lawns and dozens of sculptures.<ref name=KTVZ>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ktvz.com/news/petersen-rock-garden-rocks-grand-reopening/-/413192/20312070/-/xoaq39z/-/index.html|title=Petersen Rock Garden 'rocks' grand reopening|accessdate=May 31, 2013|date=May 26, 2013|first=Kandra|last=Kent|publisher=[[KTVZ]]|location=Bend, Oregon}}</ref><ref name=OCT/> In 2011, the garden was named one of [[Oregon's Most Endangered Places]] by the [[Historic Preservation League of Oregon]].

According to the [[Northwest Digital Archives]], photographer Myron Symons typed the following description of the garden during the 1940s within a photo album that is now part of [[University of Washington Libraries]], Special Collections:
{{Quote|Miniature castles, picturesque fountains and beautiful terraces within the grounds pictured here, on the Rasmus Peterson [sic] place between Bend and Redmond, Oregon, tell their own stories, but unless the visitor inspects the grounds carefully, and with a questing heart, he will fail to read the strange stories told by the ancient stones used in the construction.... Look twice at that bit of petrified wood, for it is a remnant of a great redwood forest that once flourished in Central Oregon.... Examine that banded rock carefully: It is a bit of a thunderegg hatched in the lavas of old Oregon.... Feel the cool surface of those glass-like rocks: They are volcanic glasses melted in plutonic fires.... Trace the growth rings on that bit of petrified sequoia: They tell a story of weather born of oceans that swept over beaches now elevated into Oregon mountains. Enjoy the blooms of these rock gardens, but do not overlook the stories of the rocks.<ref name=NWDA/>}}

Petersen Rock Garden has attracted visitors from around the world. In 2009, ''[[The Oregonian]]''{{'s}} Terry Richard wrote that Petersen's work is "more than a half-century old, but it's still amazing".<ref name=Richard/> The Historic Preservation League of Oregon considers the garden a "real gem" for its local significance and its "unique expression of mid-century roadside architecture".<ref name=League/> [[Moon Publications]] described it as a "full-fledged rock fantasy" and a "rock garden to end all rock gardens", with a "funky" museum.<ref name=Moon/> ''Via'', the online magazine for the [[American Automobile Association]]'s [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] club, called the garden "folksy" and Petersen "imaginative" for his work.<ref name=Via/>

The garden has inspired at least one other Oregon resident to construct rock sculptures. Following his visit to Petersen Rock Garden in the early 1980s, Ira McKissen built nearly a dozen castles on the terraces of his [[Rowena, Oregon|Rowena]] home; some of them have since been relocated to his daughter's house, located {{convert|5|mi}} west of [[The Dalles, Oregon|The Dalles]] along the [[Historic Columbia River Highway]] ([[U.S. Route 30 in Oregon|U.S. Route 30]]).<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=EGNjKKGuFfsC&pg=PT268&lpg=PT268&dq#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=pages=256-257|accessdate=June 3, 2013|first=Harriet|last=Baskas|title=Oregon Curiosities: Quirky Characters, Roadside Oddities, and Other Offbeat Stuff|publisher=[[Globe Pequot Press]]|date=January 6, 2010|isbn=978-0762749713}}</ref> In 2013, Pennan Brae released a [[music video]] for the song "Don't Know Nothing 'Bout Love", which was filmed at Petersen Rock Garden.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://oregonmusicnews.com/2013/01/29/music-video-of-the-day-pennan-brae-dont-know-nothing-bout-love/|title=Video of the day: Pennan Brae <U+2013> 'Don't Know Nothing 'Bout Love'&thinsp;|date=January 29, 2013|accessdate=June 3, 2013|work=''Oregon Music News''|location=Portland, Oregon}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://vimeo.com/55147056|title=&thinsp;'Don't Know Nothing 'Bout Love' by Pennan Brae|accessdate=June 3, 2013|year=2013|publisher=[[Vimeo]]}}</ref>{{Clear}}
