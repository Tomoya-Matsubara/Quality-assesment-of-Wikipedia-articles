The '''Kennet and Avon Canal''' is a [[waterway]] in southern England with an overall length of {{convert|87|mi|km}},<ref>{{cite web|title=Information Pack: Kennet and Avon Canal|url=http://www.wow4water.net/media/images/kennet%20and%20avon%20canal%20info%20pack.pdf | format=PDF | page=2|work=Wow 4 Water|publisher=British Waterways|accessdate=22 May 2011}}</ref> made up of two lengths of [[navigable river]] linked by a [[canal]]. The name is commonly used to refer to the entire length of the navigation rather than solely to the central canal section. From [[Bristol]] to [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] the waterway follows the natural course of the [[River Avon, Bristol|River Avon]] before the canal links it to the [[River Kennet]] at [[Newbury, Berkshire|Newbury]], and from there to [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]] on the [[River Thames]]. In all, the waterway incorporates more than 100 [[Lock (water transport)|locks]].

The two river stretches were made navigable in the early 18th century, and the {{convert|57|mi|km|adj=on}} canal section was constructed between 1794 and 1810. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the canal gradually fell into disuse after the opening of the [[Great Western Railway]]. In the latter half of the 20th century the canal was restored in stages, largely by volunteers. After decades of dereliction and much restoration work, it was fully reopened in 1990. The Kennet and Avon Canal has been developed as a popular heritage tourism destination for boating, [[canoeing]], [[fishing]], [[walking]], and [[cycling]], and is also important for [[wildlife conservation]].

==History==
===Early plans===
The idea of an east to west waterway link across southern England was first mentioned in [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] times, between 1558 and 1603,<ref name=clew15to18>{{harvnb |Clew |1985 |pp=15<U+2013>18}}</ref> to take advantage of the proximity of the rivers [[River Avon, Bristol|Avon]] and [[River Thames|Thames]], only {{convert|3|mi|km}} apart at their closest. Later, around 1626, [[Henry Briggs (mathematician)|Henry Briggs]] made a survey of the two rivers and noted that the land between them was level and easy to dig. He proposed a canal to connect them, but following Briggs' death in 1630 the plan was dropped. After the [[English Civil War]] four [[Bill (proposed law)|bills]] were presented to parliament, but all failed after opposition from gentry, farmers and traders worried about cheaper water transport reducing the value of fees on [[turnpike road]]s they controlled, and cheaper produce from Wales undercutting locally produced food.<ref name=clew15to18/> The main alternative to road transport for the carriage of goods between [[Bristol]] and London was a hazardous sea route through the [[English Channel]]. The small coastal [[sailing ships]] of the day were often damaged by Atlantic storms, and risked being attacked by [[warships]] of the [[French navy]] and [[privateers]] during a succession of conflicts with France.<ref name="hist">{{cite web | title=Kennet & Avon Canal Trust | url=http://home.btconnect.com/kenavon/history_page01.html | publisher=Kennet and Avon Canal Trust | accessdate=20 September 2006}}</ref>

Plans for a waterway were shelved until the early 18th century. In 1723 the Kennet Navigation through [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]] opened. The Avon navigation from Bristol to Bath was opened in 1727; the first cargo of "Deal boards, Pig-Lead and Meal" reached Bath in December.<ref name=allsop4>{{harvnb |Allsop |1987 |p=4}}</ref> The two navigations were built to meet local needs independently of one another, but both under the supervision of surveyor and engineer [[John Hore]]. In 1788 the so-called "Western Canal" was proposed to improve trade and communication links to towns such as [[Hungerford]], [[Marlborough, Wiltshire]], [[Calne]], [[Chippenham, Wiltshire|Chippenham]] and [[Melksham]]. The following year the engineers Barns, Simcock and Weston submitted a proposed route for this canal, although there were doubts about the adequacy of the water supply. The name was changed from Western Canal to Kennet and Avon Canal to avoid confusion with the [[Grand Western Canal]], which was being proposed at the same time.<ref name=russell7to10>{{harvnb |Russell |1997 |pp=7<U+2013>10}}</ref>

===Construction===
[[File:John Rennie (Engineer).jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Portrait of male with white hair wearing a white cravat and blue jacket.|Surveyor, [[John Rennie (father)|John Rennie]]: portrait by [[Henry Raeburn|Sir Henry Raeburn]], 1810]]
In 1793 a further survey was conducted by [[John Rennie (engineer)|John Rennie]], and the route of the canal was altered to take a more southerly course through [[Great Bedwyn]], [[Devizes]], [[Trowbridge]] and [[Newbury, Berkshire|Newbury]]. The proposed route was accepted by the Kennet and Avon Canal Company, chaired by [[Charles Dundas, 1st Baron Amesbury|Charles Dundas]], and the company started to take [[Subscription (finance)|subscriptions]] from prospective shareholders. In July 1793 Rennie suggested further alterations to the route, including the construction of a tunnel in the [[Savernake Forest]].<ref name=russell7to10/> On 17&nbsp;April 1794 the Kennet and Avon Canal Act received the [[Royal Assent]] and construction began. The Newbury to Hungerford section was completed in 1798, and was extended to Great Bedwyn in 1799. The section from Bath to Foxhangers was finished in 1804, and the two were linked by an iron railway until the completion of Devizes Locks in 1810.<ref name=russell7to10/>

The canal opened in 1810 after 16 years of construction. Major structures included the [[Dundas Aqueduct|Dundas]] and [[Avoncliff Aqueduct|Avoncliff]] [[aqueducts]], the [[Bruce Tunnel]] under Savernake Forest, and the [[pumping station]]s at [[Claverton Pumping Station|Claverton]] and [[Crofton Pumping Station|Crofton]], needed to overcome water supply problems. The final engineering task was the completion of the [[Caen Hill Locks]] at Devizes.<ref name=allsop5>{{harvnb |Allsop |1987 |p=5}}</ref>

===Operation===

In 1801, trade along the canal commenced, even though goods had to be unloaded at Foxhangers at the bottom of what is now [[Caen Hill Locks]], transported up the hill by a [[horse-drawn railway]], and reloaded into barges at the top. When the flight of locks finally opened in 1810, allowing the same vessel to navigate the entire canal, the rate of carriage per ton from London to Bath was <U+00A3>2&nbsp;9s&nbsp;6d. This compared well with carriage by road, which cost <U+00A3>6&nbsp;3s to <U+00A3>7 per ton, and therefore trade on the canal flourished. In 1812, the Kennet and Avon Canal Company bought the Kennet Navigation, which stretched from Newbury to the junction with the Thames at Kennet Mouth, near Reading. The purchase from Frederick Page cost <U+00A3>100,000, of which <U+00A3>70,000 was paid in cash with the balance paid back over a period of time. The purchase was authorised by the Kennet Navigation Act of June 1813, which enabled the company to raise the funds through the sale of 5,500 shares at <U+00A3>24 each. At the same time work was undertaken to improve the Avon Navigation, from Bristol to Bath, with the Kennet and Avon Canal Company purchasing a majority shareholding in the Avon Navigation in 1816.<ref name=clew79to80>{{harvnb| Clew |1985 |pp=79<U+2013>80}}</ref>

By 1818, seventy 60-ton barges were working on the canal, the majority of the tonnage being accounted for by coal and stone travelling via the [[Somerset Coal Canal]].<ref name=clew82>{{harvnb |Clew |1985 |p=82}}</ref> The journey from Bath to Newbury took an average of three and a half days. By 1832, 300,000&nbsp;tons of freight was being carried each year and, between 1825 and 1834, the company had an annual revenue of around <U+00A3>45,000.<ref name=russell7to10/>

===Decline===
[[File:Pillbox alongside the canal - geograph.org.uk - 1340793.jpg|thumb|left|A Second World War [[Bunker#Pillbox|pillbox]] near [[Kintbury]]]]
The opening of the [[Great Western Railway]] in 1841 removed much of the canal's traffic, even though the canal company lowered tariffs.<ref name=lj>{{harvnb |Lindley-Jones |2002 |pp=9<U+2013>10}}</ref>  In 1852 the railway company took over the canal's operation, levying high tolls at every [[toll point]] and reducing the amount spent on maintenance. Ice-breaking was stopped before the winter of 1857, and traders were further encouraged by preferential tolls to use the railway rather than the canal. In 1861 a new order prohibited any traffic on the canal at night, and, in 1865, boats were forced to pass through locks in pairs to reduce water loss. By 1868 the annual tonnage had fallen from 360,610 in 1848 to 210,567. In the 1870s [[water abstraction]] from the canal near [[Fobney Lock]] followed the regulations introduced in the Reading Local Board Waterworks, Sewerage, Drainage and Improvements Act of 1870, and contributed to the silting up of locks and stretches of the canal.  Several wharves and stretches of towpath were closed. In 1877 the canal recorded a deficit of <U+00A3>1,920 and never subsequently made any profit.<ref name=clew107>{{harvnb |Clew |1985 | p=107}}</ref>

The [[Somerset Coal Canal]] and [[Wilts and Berks Canal]], which each supplied some of the trade from the [[Somerset coalfield]] to the Kennet and Avon,<ref name=hadfield92>{{harvnb |Hadfield |1967 |p=92}}</ref> closed in 1904 and 1906 respectively. In 1926, following a loss of <U+00A3>18,041 the previous year,<ref name=clew136>{{harvnb |Clew |1985 |p=136}}</ref> the Great Western Railway sought to close the canal by obtaining a Ministry of Transport Order, but the move was resisted and the company charged with improving its maintenance of the canal.<ref name="lj"/> Cargo trade continued to decline, but a few pleasure boats started to use the canal.<ref name=clew140>{{harvnb |Clew |1985 |p=140}}</ref>

During the Second World War a large number of [[concrete]] [[bunker]]s known as [[Bunker#Pillbox|pillboxes]] were built as part of the [[GHQ Line]] to [[British anti-invasion preparations of World War II|defend against an expected German invasion]], many of which are still visible along the banks of the canal.<ref>{{cite web|title=Defence Area 27 Semington / Whaddon|url=http://ads.ahds.ac.uk/catalogue//adsdata/arch-455-1/dissemination/pdf/Text_Reports/DA27_TEXT_-_SEMINGTON_-_WHADDON.pdf | page=2| format=PDF|publisher=Arts and Humanities Data Service|accessdate=22 May 2011}}</ref> They were generally built close to road and rail bridges, which would have formed important crossing points for enemy troops and vehicles.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pillboxes of World War II|url=http://www.hungerfordvirtualmuseum.co.uk/Bastions_of_Berkshire.pdf|work=Bastions of Berkshire | isbn=1-851-63193-3 | format=PDF|publisher=Hungerford Virtual Museum|accessdate=12 July 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Loaring|first=Simon | coauthors=Hunt, David|title=An island in the vale|url=http://www.ihbc.org.uk/context_archive/109/island/island.html|publisher=Institute of Historic Building Conservation|accessdate=12 July 2011}}</ref> After the war the Transport Act of 1947 meant that control of the canal passed to the [[British Transport Commission]], but by the 1950s large sections of the canal had been closed because of poor lock maintenance following a breach in the bank west of the [[Avoncliff Aqueduct]].<ref name=russell7to10/>

===Closure avoided===

[[File:Dundas.bridge.arp.jpg|thumb|[[Dundas Aqueduct]] near [[Limpley Stoke]]]]
A group supporting the restoration of the canal had been set up in the early 1950s independently of the [[Inland Waterways Association]], with which it was subsequently merged. In 1955 John Gould, a trader on the eastern section of the waterway, successfully petitioned against the commission's failure to maintain the waterway and obtained damages for loss of business. In March 1956 a clause in the British Transport Commission (no 2) Act was presented to parliament that would have removed the right of navigation between Reading and Bath. The Act was opposed by Gould and by the local authorities along the canal.<ref name="iwakahist">{{cite web|title=Kennet & Avon Canal|url=http://www.waterways.org.uk/learning/historic_campaigns/kennet___avon_canal|publisher=Inland Waterways Association|accessdate=17 May 2011}}</ref> They were supported by a 22,000-signature petition to the Queen, brought to London from Bristol by water, although parts of the canal had to be traversed by canoe.<ref name="iwakahist"/> This campaign led to an inquiry by a Parliamentary [[Select committee (Westminster system)|Select Committee]]. The committee supported the suspension of the right of navigation, and the Bill passed through the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] but was amended by the [[House of Lords]] to include a clause to enforce "no further deterioration". In July 1958, the Bowes Committee published their ''Inquiry into Inland Waterways'' which specifically mentioned the Kennet and Avon finding "no justification for restoring the section from Reading to Bath".<ref name=clew156>{{harvnb |Clew |1985 |p=156}}</ref>

A government [[white paper]] followed the Bowes Report in February 1959, recommending that an Inland Waterways Redevelopment Advisory Committee should assist schemes to regenerate canals that were no longer able to collect enough fees from tolls to pay for their upkeep. Further reports followed, and in 1962 the Advisory Committee reported that the canal should be redeveloped, and allocated <U+00A3>20,000 for maintenance and <U+00A3>20,000 to begin restoration.<ref name=clew164>{{harvnb |Clew |1985 |p=164}}</ref> The [[Kennet and Avon Canal Trust]] was formed in 1962 to restore the canal from Reading to Bristol as a through navigation and as a public amenity. It was originally a voluntary group which had previously been known as the Kennet and Avon Canal Association. The Trust gained [[Charitable organization|charitable status]] in April and was incorporated under the [[Companies Act 1948|Companies Act]] on 6 June 1962.<ref name=lj41>{{harvnb |Lindley-Jones |2002 |p=41}}</ref> In 1963 the newly formed [[British Waterways]], which was created by the [[Transport Act 1962|Transport Act]] of the previous year, and replaced the British Transport Commission as the statuary body for inland waterways, took over the canal and, in partnership with the Trust and [[riparian]] local authorities, restoration work began.<ref name="katrade">{{cite web|title=Kennet & Avon Canal|url=http://www.katrade.org.uk/canal.htm|publisher=Kennet and Avon Trade Association|accessdate=22 May 2011}}</ref>

===Restoration===
[[File:Devizeslockspreresotoration.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Caen Hill Locks]] in the 1970s]]
Restoration work involved a collaboration between staff from British Waterways and volunteer labour. In 1966 [[Sulhamstead Lock]] was rebuilt and the [[Puddling (engineering)|re-puddling]] of the dry section at [[Limpley Stoke]] was begun. In 1968, restoration work was undertaken on the [[Bath Locks]] and [[Burghfield Lock]]. In Reading at Bridge Street the navigable headroom had been reduced from {{convert|8|ft|6|in|m}} to {{convert|4|ft|6|in|m}} by strengthening girders added to the underside of the bridge.<ref name=clew143>{{harvnb |Clew |1985 |p=143}}</ref> This was replaced with a new bridge enabling craft to pass more easily.<ref name="iwakahist"/> The canal was reopened from the Thames to Hungerford Wharf in July 1974.<ref name="hunghist"/> Re-puddling was a long process therefore experiments with the use of heavy gauge polythene to line the canal were undertaken. The [[Avoncliff Aqueduct]] was lined with a concrete "cradle" and made water-tight in 1980.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Kennet and Avon Canal|url=http://www.avoncliff.co.uk/history/canal.htm|publisher=Avoncliff|accessdate=17 May 2011}}</ref>

Further works continued through the 1980s. The County Council in [[Berkshire]], supported by local councils, estimated that <U+00A3>1,275,000 was needed for works at the eastern end of the canal and commenced work on replacing some of the bridges. In [[Wiltshire]] concerns over the limited water supply to the [[Route summit|summit]], at the highest point of the canal, indicated that back-pumping would be required, which increased the estimated cost for the county to <U+00A3>761,560. The [[Wilton Water]] reservoir was estimated to produce less than {{convert|750,000|impgal|l}} per day, and the Seend feeder only {{convert|250,000|impgal|l}}. [[Wessex Water|Wessex Water Authority]]<!-- its name at the time --> agreed to the extraction of {{convert|1,000,000|impgal|l}} per day from the Avon at Claverton to be pumped east; the costs of the pumps was <U+00A3>175,000.<ref name=lj77>{{harvnb |Lindley-Jones |2002 |p=77}}</ref>

Various fund-raising schemes, along with some financial support from local authorities, allowed small-scale work on the locks to continue, but the projected timescales for completion were missed. In 1983 the [[Manpower Services Commission]], which had a remit to co-ordinate employment and training services in the United Kingdom, agreed to employ 50 men on work that included restoration of [[Aldermaston Lock]], its adjacent wharf, and [[Widmead Lock]]. The restoration of the [[Dundas Aqueduct]] and several smaller schemes were later added to the list. Maintenance agreements were signed with local authorities along the route, while fund-raising activities continued. The [[National Association for the Care and Resettlement of Offenders]] sponsored a workshop, which opened in [[Shrivenham]] in 1987, to create new lock gates for the Crofton and Devizes flights. In 1988 the restoration of [[Woolhampton Lock]] was completed, but obstructions remained on either side. Frounds [[swing bridge]] could not be opened and the restoration of [[Midgham Lock]] had not been finished; both were completed the following year. Re-puddling of the Crofton pounds was carried out in 1989, along with the reconstruction of Midgham Bridge. Restoration of the turf-sided [[Monkey Marsh Lock]] proved difficult because of its status as a [[Scheduled Ancient Monument]], and the consequent need to protect the historic site while improving safety.<ref name=lj78to93>{{harvnb |Lindley-Jones |2002 |pp=78<U+2013>93}}</ref>

[[File:Monkey Marsh Lock - geograph.org.uk - 333244.jpg|thumb|right|[[Monkey Marsh Lock]]]]
The stretch between Reading and Newbury was finally completed on 17 July 1990; at a ceremony held at [[Monkey Marsh Lock]] several boats competed for the honour of becoming the first craft through. But concerns about the adequacy of the water supply still remained when Queen [[Elizabeth II]] formally reopened the canal on 8&nbsp;August 1990. The Queen was able to travel on the Trust's boat ''Rose of Hungerford'' through locks 44 and 43 on the Caen Hill flight, breaking a ceremonial tape between them.<ref name=lj101to102>{{harvnb |Lindley-Jones |2002 |pp=101<U+2013>102}}</ref> The shortage of water was addressed in 1996 by the installation of new back pumps at the flight of 29&nbsp;locks at Caen Hill in Devizes, at a cost of <U+00A3>1&nbsp;million. The pumps raise water {{convert|235|ft|m}} at a rate of {{convert|300000|impgal}} per hour (380&nbsp;litres per second). In October 1996,<ref name=lj120>{{harvnb |Lindley-Jones |2002 |p=120}}</ref> the Kennet & Avon Canal Partnership attracted the largest single [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|National Lottery]] grant awarded by the [[Heritage Lottery Fund]], <U+00A3>25&nbsp;million towards a <U+00A3>29&nbsp;million project,<ref>{{cite web|title=Kennet & Avon Canal|url=http://www.britishwaterways.co.uk/south-west/community-projects/kennet-and-avon-canal|publisher=British Waterways|accessdate=17 May 2011}}</ref> to complete the restoration and to make it operational, sustainable and accessible for the enjoyment of future generations.<ref name="hunghist">{{cite web|title=The restoration of the canal|url=http://www.hungerfordvirtualmuseum.co.uk/Themes/Transport/Kennet_and_Avon_Canal/The_Restoration_of_the_Canal/the_restoration_of_the_canal.html|publisher=Hungerford Virtual Museum|accessdate=17 May 2011}}</ref> The work funded included complete rebuilding of Foxhangers Lock and bridge at Caen Hill, replacement of lock gates at Seend and Crofton, channel lining at Claverton, embankment repairs at Martinslade, improvements at Claverton pumping station and dredging at various sites.<ref name=lj127>{{harvnb |Lindley-Jones |2002 |p=127}}</ref> The restoration's completion was celebrated in May 2003 by a visit from [[HRH Prince Charles]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Prince Charles' Visit|url=http://www.britishwaterways.co.uk/south-west/regeneration-projects/prince-charles-visit|publisher=British Waterways|accessdate=8 July 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=Kennet & Avon Canal Museum | url=http://www.ipresent.co.uk/KA3.HTM | publisher=Interactive Presentations | accessdate=19 September 2006}}</ref> but upgrading and maintenance continues. Between 2002 and 2004 the [[Dundas Aqueduct]], which had been relined with [[polythene]] and [[concrete]] in 1984<ref name=allsop23>{{harvnb |Allsop |1987 |p=23}}</ref> without disturbing a colony of bats living under the aqueduct,<ref name=pearson21>{{harvnb |Pearson |2003 |p=21}}</ref> was further restored by the replacement of engineering bricks used by the [[Great Western Railway]] with [[Bath Stone]] to match the original work.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dundas Aqueduct|url=http://www.britishwaterways.co.uk/south-west/regeneration-projects/kennet-and-avon-canal|publisher=British Waterways|accessdate=17 May 2011}}</ref>

In 2011 the [[Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]] designated the canal a national "cruiseway" as defined by the [[Transport Act 1968]]. The listing imposes a legal requirement on British Waterways to maintain the canal to a standard that ensures cruising craft can safely navigate the entire length of the waterway.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kennet & Avon Canal gains 'cruiseway' status|url=http://www.waterscape.com/features-and-articles/news/3025/kennet-and-avon-canal-gains-cruiseway-status|work=Waterscape|publisher=British Waterways|accessdate=18 June 2011}}</ref>

Between [[Kintbury Lock]] and Newbury, passing to the north of [[Hamstead Marshall]], the canal is very close to the River Kennet, which flows into the canal via several channels.<ref name=russell15>{{harvnb |Russell |1997 |p=15}}</ref> The canal passes through an area known as the [[Kennet Valley Alderwoods]], the largest remaining fragments of damp, ash-alder woodland in the River Kennet [[floodplain]]. The SSSI includes two woods&nbsp;<U+2013> the Wilderness and part of Ryott's Plantation&nbsp;<U+2013> which are important because they support a very great diversity of plants associated with this woodland type, dominated by Alder (''[[Alnus glutinosa]]''); though Ash (''[[Fraxinus excelsior]]'') is abundant in places and there is occasional [[Pedunculate Oak|Oak]] (''Quercus robur'') and [[Wych Elm]] (''Ulmus glabra''). In addition to the wide range of higher plants the woods support a diverse [[bryophyte]] flora including the uncommon [[epiphytes]] ''Radula complanata'', ''Zygodon viridissimus'' and ''Orthotrichum affine''.<ref>{{cite web | title=SSSI citation sheet for Kennet Valley Alderwoods | publisher=[[English Nature]] | url=http://www.english-nature.org.uk/citation/citation_photo/2000123.pdf | format=PDF| accessdate=24 September 2006}}</ref> Nearby is [[Irish Hill Copse]]. This site of coppiced [[ancient woodland]] includes an extensive area of calcareous ash/wych elm coppice on the hill sides, merging into wet [[Ash tree|ash]]/[[maple]] and acid [[oak]]/ash/[[hazel]] woodland with [[aspen]], on the higher parts of the site. The lower slopes are dominated by [[Dog's Mercury]] (''Mercurialis perennis''), with abundant [[Paris quadrifolia|Herb Paris]] (''Paris quadrifolia''), [[Toothwort]] (''Lathraea squamaria''), [[Polygonatum|Solomon's seal]] (''Polygonatum multiflorum''), [[Twayblade]] and [[Early Purple Orchid]]s (''Listera ovata'') and ''Orchis mascula'' and, locally, [[Wild Daffodil]] (''Narcissus pseudonarcissus'').<ref>{{cite web | title=SSSI citation sheet for Irish Hill Copse | publisher=[[English Nature]] | url=http://www.english-nature.org.uk/citation/citation_photo/1003175.pdf | format=PDF | accessdate=24 September 2006}}</ref>

A wooden bridge was built close to [[Newbury Lock]]<ref>{{IoE |396504 |Newbury Lock |accessdate=16 May 2011}}</ref> in 1726, replaced in stone between 1769 and 1772 by James Clarke,<ref>{{IoE|394290 |Bridge over River Kennet |accessdate=16 May 2011}}</ref> and now known as the Town Bridge or Water Bridge. As there is no tow path, a line to haul the barge had to be floated under the bridge and then re-attached to the horse where the tow path resumed.<ref name=russell11>{{harvnb |Russell |1997 |p=11}}</ref>

==Newbury to Reading==
{{K+A-N-R}}
[[File:Newbury Wharf.jpg|thumb|left|Newbury Wharf]]
The River Kennet is navigable from [[Newbury, Berkshire|Newbury]] downstream to the confluence with the [[River Thames]] at Kennet Mouth, in [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]].<ref name=kennetukwaterways>{{cite web|title=River Kennet|url=http://www.ukcanals.net/rkennet.html|publisher=Waterways of the UK|accessdate=21 July 2011}}</ref>

The stretch from Newbury to [[High Bridge, Reading|High Bridge]] in Reading is an improved river navigation known as the ''Kennet Navigation'', opened in 1723. Throughout this navigation stretches of natural riverbed alternate with {{convert|11|mi|km}} of artificial lock cuts and a series of locks that overcome a fall of {{convert|130|ft|m}}.<ref name=pearson42to52>{{harvnb |Pearson |2003 |pp=42<U+2013>52}}</ref>

East of Newbury town centre the Kennet passes through the [[Thatcham Reed Beds]] a {{convert|169|acre|ha}} [[Site of Special Scientific Interest]], nationally important for its extensive reedbed, and species-rich [[alder]] woodland and fen habitats. The latter supports [[Desmoulin's whorl snail]] ''(Vertigo moulinsiana)'', which is of national and European importance. A large assemblage of breeding birds including nationally rare species such as [[Cetti's Warbler]] (''Cettia cetti'') make use of the reedbed, fen and open water habitats found at Thatcham Reed Beds.<ref>{{cite web | title=SSSI citation sheet for Thatcham Reed Beds | publisher=[[English Nature]] | url=http://www.english-nature.org.uk/citation/citation_photo/1002762.pdf |format=PDF| accessdate=22 September 2006}}</ref> Thatcham's network of [[gravel pit]]s, [[reedbed]], woodland, hedges and [[grassland]] is rich in wildlife and has been made into [[The Nature Discovery Centre]] by the [[Royal Society for the Protection of Birds]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Thatcham Reedbeds and Greenham Common | publisher=Royal Society for the Protection of Birds | url=http://www.rspb.org.uk/england/central/school_visits/thatcham.asp | accessdate=22 September 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060522202500/http://www.rspb.org.uk/england/central/school_visits/thatcham.asp <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 22 May 2006}}</ref>

[[Monkey Marsh Lock]] at [[Thatcham]] is one of only two remaining working examples of turf-sided locks on the canal today.<ref>{{cite web|title=Monkey Marsh Lock|url=http://www.pastscape.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=237124|work=Pastscape National Monument Record|publisher=[[English Heritage]]|accessdate=20 June 2011}}</ref> It is listed as a [[Scheduled Ancient Monument]] by English Heritage.<ref name=colins94>{{harvnb |Nicholson |2006 |p=94}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=Monkey Marsh Lock | publisher=Arts and Humanities Data Service | url=http://ads.ahds.ac.uk/catalogue/search/fr.cfm?rcn=EHNMR-652342|accessdate=14 June 2009}}</ref>

Below [[Colthrop Lock]] in [[Thatcham]] the river leaves behind the built-up area of Newbury and runs in generally rural surroundings. It passes through the [[Woolhampton Reed Bed]], another SSSI which consists of dense [[reed bed]] with smaller areas of tall [[fen]] vegetation and [[carr (fen)|carr woodland]]. It is notable for the diversity of insects it supports and its nesting [[passerine]] bird populations, which include several uncommon species such as [[Reed Warbler]] (''Acrocephalus scirpaceus''), a species that in Britain nests almost exclusively in this habitat.<ref>{{cite web | title=SSSI citation sheet for Woolhampton Reed Bed | publisher=[[English Nature]] | url=http://www.english-nature.org.uk/citation/citation_photo/1000370.pdf |format=PDF| accessdate=22 September 2006}}</ref>

[[Aldermaston Gravel Pits]] consist of mature flooded [[gravel]] workings surrounded by dense fringing vegetation, trees and scrub, affording a variety of habitats for breeding birds and a refuge for wildfowl. The irregular shoreline with islands, promontories, sheltered [[/Eutrophic#Eutrophic|eutrophic]] pools and narrow lagoons, provides undisturbed habitat for many water birds, including surface-feeding ducks such as [[Common Teal|Teal]] (''Anas crecca'') and [[Shoveler]] (''Anas clypeata''). The surrounding marsh and scrub are important for numerous birds including nine breeding species of [[Warblers]], [[Water Rail]]s (''Rallus aquaticus''), [[Kingfishers]] (''Alcedoa atthis'') and an important breeding colony of [[Nightingales]] (''Luscinia megarhynchos'').<ref>{{cite web | title=SSSI citation sheet for Aldermaston Gravel Pits | publisher=[[English Nature]] | url=http://www.english-nature.org.uk/citation/citation_photo/1002776.pdf#search=%22Aldermaston%20Gravel%20Pits%22 | format=PDF | accessdate=23 September 2006}}</ref> In 2002 [[English Nature]] bought Aldermaston Gravel Pits from the mineral extraction company [[Grundon]] and it is managed as a [[nature reserve]] by the [[Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire Wildlife Trust]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.aldermaston.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=34&Itemid=53 | title=Aldermaston Gravel Pits | publisher=Aldermaston Parish Council | accessdate=21 May 2011}}</ref>  The [[River Kennet]] itself, from near its sources west of Marlborough down to Woolhampton, has been designated as a SSSI primarily because it has an extensive range of rare plants and animals that are unique to [[chalk]] watercourses.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.english-nature.org.uk/citation/citation_photo/2000164.pdf |format=PDF| title = SSSI citation sheet for  River Kennet | publisher=[[English Nature]] | accessdate =18 March 2008 }}</ref>

[[File:The Oracle, Reading, riverside.jpg|alt=Stretch of canal with large modern buildings and concrete walkways on either side.|thumb|left|[[Brewery Gut]] within [[The Oracle, Reading|The Oracle]]]]
The village of [[Woolhampton]] and the canal settlement of [[Aldermaston Wharf]] are the only significant settlements until the river enters the built-up area of Reading at [[Sheffield Lock]] in [[Theale, Berkshire|Theale]]. Even after this, the river is isolated from Reading's suburbs by a wide [[flood plain]] surrounding the river. In this stretch is [[Garston Lock]], the other turf-sided lock on the navigation.<ref>{{cite web | title=All change for the K&A | url=http://www.jim-shead.com/waterways/Articles.php?wpage=46 | publisher=Jim Shead | accessdate=16 September 2006}}</ref>

Shortly after passing [[Fobney Lock]] and the associated [[water treatment]] works, the Kennet flood plain narrows and the river enters a narrow steep-sided gap in the hills forming the southern flank of the Thames flood plain.<ref name=pearson52>{{harvnb |Pearson |2003 |p=52}}</ref> At [[County Lock]] the river enters the centre of Reading, where it formerly flowed through the centre of a large [[brewery]]. This narrow and twisting stretch of the river became known as [[Brewery Gut]]. Because of poor visibility and the difficulty of boats passing in this stretch, traffic has long been controlled by a set of maritime [[traffic light]]s.<ref name=pearson53>{{harvnb |Pearson |2003 |p=53}}</ref> Today the Brewery Gut is a major feature of Reading's [[The Oracle, Reading|The Oracle]] shopping centre.<ref name=kennetukwaterways/>

[[File:Kennet Mouth.JPG|thumb|left|Kennet Mouth with bridge of the [[Great Western Main Line]] where the River Kennet meets the [[River Thames]]]]
Immediately after The Oracle the river flows under the arched High Bridge, which forms a historical and administrative divide on the river. The last mile of the River Kennet in Reading below the bridge has been navigable since at least the 13th century. Because there is no wide floodplain, wharves could be built during the [[Middle Ages]] that allowed Reading to establish itself as a river port.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ukcanals.net/kennet.html|title=Kennet & Avon Canal|publisher=UK Canals Network|accessdate=15 May 2011}}</ref> Originally this short stretch of river, which includes [[Blake's Lock]], was under the control of [[Reading Abbey]], but today it is administered by the [[Environment Agency]] as if it were part of the River Thames.<ref>{{cite web | title=Blake's Lock | work=River Thames Guide | url=http://www.riverthames.co.uk/about_thames/3687.htm | publisher=The River Thames Guide | accessdate=17 September 2006}}</ref><ref name=allsop49>{{harvnb |Allsop |1987 |p=49}}</ref> The Horseshoe Bridge at Kennet Mouth was built as a railway bridge in 1839, and the  timber-clad iron-truss accommodation bridge was added in 1892.<ref>{{cite web|title=Monument No: 1537729|url=http://www.pastscape.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=1537729|work=Pastscape national Monument Record|publisher=[[English Heritage]]|accessdate=21 July 2011}}</ref>

==Canal today==
[[File:Devizes wharf.JPG|thumb|left|260px|alt=Water with two narrow boats and bridge|[[Kennet & Avon Canal Museum|Canal Museum]] at [[Devizes]] Wharf]]
The canal today is a [[heritage tourism]] destination. Boating, with [[narrowboats]] and [[Cabin Cruiser|cruisers]], is a popular tourist attraction particularly in the summer months. Privately owned craft and hire boats from the range of [[marina]]s are much in evidence, and there are numerous [[canoe]] clubs along its length. The annual [[Devizes to Westminster International Canoe Marathon]] starts from Devizes Wharf, the site of the [[Kennet & Avon Canal Museum]], at first light on [[Good Friday]] each year and the competitors have to negotiate 75&nbsp;locks in the {{convert|125|mi|adj=on}} route between Devizes and the finish at [[Westminster]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dwrace.org.uk/main%20site/milage.htm|title=Mileage chart|publisher=Devizes to Westminster International Canoe Race|accessdate=5 October 2008}}</ref> The winning time is usually around 17<U+00BD> hours.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dwrace.org.uk/main%20site/about_dw_write_up.htm|title=DW&nbsp;<U+2013> What's it all about?|publisher=Devizes to Westminster International Canoe Race|accessdate=5 October 2008}}</ref>

Cycling is permitted along the canal [[towpath]] except for a {{convert|656|yd|m|0}} section near [[Woolhampton]]. Some sections of the canal towpath have been improved and widened to make them more suitable for cyclists and disabled users. Under a partnership arrangement involving British Waterways, [[Sustrans]], and the riparian local authorities, two main sections of the canal have been improved, and, with a few short diversions, run from Reading to [[Marsh Benham]] and from Devizes to Bath as part of the [[National Cycle Network]] (NCN) [[National Cycle Route 4|Route 4]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sustrans.org.uk/what-we-do/national-cycle-network/route-numbering-system/route-4|title=NCR 4|publisher=Sustrans|accessdate=15 May 2011}}</ref> Fishing for [[bream]], [[tench]], [[Common Roach|roach]], [[rudd]], [[perch]], [[gudgeon]], [[Esox|pike]] and [[carp]] is permitted throughout the year from the towpath of the canal, but almost its whole length is leased to angling associations or fishing clubs. There are a variety of riverside [[public houses]], shops and tea rooms. The Kennet and Avon Canal Trust operates shops and tearooms at [[Aldermaston Lock]], [[Newbury Lock|Newbury Wharf]], [[Crofton Pumping Station]], [[Devizes]], and [[Bradford on Avon]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Useful info | publisher=Kennet and Avon Canal Trust | url=http://home.btconnect.com/kenavon/usefulinfo.pdf | page=5 | format=PDF | accessdate=15 May 2011}}</ref>

===Ecology===

The canal and its environs are important for wildlife conservation. There are several [[Sites of Special Scientific Interest]] (SSSI), which exhibit great [[bio-diversity]]. Key sites that are home to several rare species include the [[Aldermaston Gravel Pits]],<ref name="aldermasten">{{cite web | title=SSSI citation sheet for Aldermaston Gravel Pits |publisher=[[English Nature]] | format=PDF | url=http://www.english-nature.org.uk/citation/citation_photo/1002776.pdf#search=%22Aldermaston%20Gravel%20Pits%22| accessdate=23 September 2006}}</ref> [[Woolhampton Reed Bed|Woolhampton]],<ref name="woolhampton">{{cite web | title=SSSI citation sheet for Woolhampton Reed Bed | publisher=English Nature | url=http://www.english-nature.org.uk/citation/citation_photo/1000370.pdf |format=PDF| accessdate=22 September 2006}}</ref> [[Thatcham Reed Beds]],<ref name="thatcham">{{cite web | title=SSSI citation sheet for Thatcham Reed Beds | publisher=English Nature | url=http://www.english-nature.org.uk/citation/citation_photo/1002762.pdf |format=PDF| accessdate=22 September 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=Thatcham Reedbeds and Greenham Common | publisher=Royal Society for the Protection of Birds | url=http://www.rspb.org.uk/england/central/school_visits/thatcham.asp | accessdate=22 September 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060522202500/http://www.rspb.org.uk/england/central/school_visits/thatcham.asp |archivedate = 22 May 2006}}</ref> and [[Freeman's Marsh]], [[Hungerford]].<ref name="english-nature.org.uk">{{cite web|url=http://www.english-nature.org.uk/citation/citation_photo/1001426.pdf|format=PDF| title=SSSI citation sheet for Freeman's Marsh|publisher=[[English Nature]]|year=1986|accessdate=22 September 2006}}</ref> There are also many non-statutory nature reserves along the canal.<ref name=vile8>{{harvnb |Vile |1991 |p=8}}</ref> More than 100&nbsp;different species of bird have been recorded in surveys over the length of the canal,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ww2.reading.gov.uk/documents/ourenvironment/stateoftheenvironment/Chap003_Wildlife.pdf | page=7|format=PDF|title=Chapter 3 Wildlife|work=State of the Environment Report|publisher=Reading Borough Council|accessdate=15 May 2011}}</ref> of which 38 could be classified as specialist waterway birds, including [[Grey Heron]] (''Ardea cinerea''), [[Reed Bunting]] (''Emberiza schoeniclus'') and [[Common Kingfisher]] (''Alcedo atthis'').<ref>{{cite web|title=Wiltshire birding sites|url=http://www.wiltshirebirds.co.uk/where-to-watch/wiltshire-birding-sites/|publisher=Wiltshire Ornithological Society|accessdate=22 May 2011}}</ref>  Fourteen&nbsp;species have been confirmed as breeding including [[Sand Martin]]s (''Riparia riparia''), which nest in drain-pipes in the brick walls of the canal in the centre of Reading.<ref>{{harvnb |Youe |Tate |1998 |pp=68<U+2013>77}}</ref> [[Wilton Water]] by [[Crofton locks]] and the Kennet Valley [[gravel pit]]s provide habitats for breeding and wintering waterfowl.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Thames and Avon Vales|url=http://www.naturalareas.naturalengland.org.uk/Science/natural/profiles%5CnaProfile63.pdf | page=15|work=Natural Area profile|publisher=[[English Nature]]|accessdate=1 July 2011}}</ref> Several species of [[Odonata]] ([[dragonflies]] and [[damselflies]]) and other invertebrates have also been recorded.<ref name="katrade"/> [[Common Reed]] (''Phragmites australis'') is among the plant species growing along the edges of the canal.<ref name=haslam410>{{harvnb |Haslam |1987 |p=410}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Moatlands Sites|url=http://tabcg.webs.com/moatlandssites.htm|publisher=Theale Area Bird Conservation Group|accessdate=22 May 2011}}</ref> Measures to preserve and create [[European water vole|water vole]] (''Arvicola amphibius or A. terrestrisis'') habitat have had considerable impact on the restoration of the canal, and new "vole-friendly" techniques of bank protection have been developed.<ref>{{cite web | title=Kennet & Avon Trade Association | url=http://www.katrade.org.uk/canal.htm | publisher=Kennet & Avon Trade Association | accessdate=23 September 2006}}</ref>
