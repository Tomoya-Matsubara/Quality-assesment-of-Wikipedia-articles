==Club career==

===Youth===
<U+00D8>degaard spent his first years in the local sports club Drammen Strong. His [[Hans Erik <U+00D8>degaard|father]], a former [[Association Football|footballer]], co-founded a football section in the club, and became the coach of his son's team.<ref name=dt_strong>{{cite web|title=Drammen Strong: <U+2013> V<U+00E6>rt mye jubel|trans_title=Drammen Strong: <U+2013> Been a lot of cheering|url=http://www.dt.no/Drammen_Strong_jubler_for_hundretusener_fra_Martin__degaard-5-57-29882.html|website=http://www.dt.no/|publisher=[[Edda Media]]|accessdate=2 February 2015|language=Norwegian|date=29 January 2015}}</ref><ref name=josimar_gfl>{{cite web|title=Gutten fra l<U+00F8>kka|trans_title=The boy from the field|url=http://www.josimar.no/artikler/gutten-fra-lokka/1909/|website=http://www.josimar.no/|publisher=Josimar|accessdate=6 February 2015|language=Norwegian}}</ref> In 2005, when <U+00D8>degaard was six, his parents and others each invested 50,000 [[Norwegian krone|kroner]] so that the local club could refit their gravel field, ''Kjappen'', with [[artificial turf]].

Drammen Strong was twice selected by <U+00D8>degaard to receive a prize of 50,000 kroner ([[Euro|<U+20AC>]]5,800), when the young player was given the [[Statoil]] talent award for April 2014 and for the 2014 season.<ref name=nff_talent_prize_2014>{{cite web|title=<U+00D8>degaard k<U+00E5>ret til <U+00E5>rets talent|url=http://www.fotball.no/Landslag_og_toppfotball/spillerutvikling/2014/Martin-Odegaard-karet-til-arets-talent/|website=http://www.fotball.no|publisher=[[Football Association of Norway|NFF]]|accessdate=6 February 2015|language=Norwegian|date=21 November 2014}}</ref> Later, in 2015, Drammen Strong received 250,000 [[Norwegian krone|kroner]], equivalent to approximately <U+20AC>29,000, as a gift from [[Str<U+00F8>msgodset IF]] when <U+00D8>degaard was sold to Real Madrid.<ref name=dt_strong_money />

In 2009, <U+00D8>degaard joined the youth division of [[Str<U+00F8>msgodset IF|Str<U+00F8>msgodset]].<ref name=dt_strong_money /> He trained and played with older boys. In 2011, at age 12, he impressed former football manager Lars Tj<U+00E6>rn<U+00E5>s during a nationwide tournament for under-16s: "''The best 15-year-olds in the country were gathered for a tournament between the top clubs.

===Str<U+00F8>msgodset===
<U+00D8>degaard began training with the Str<U+00F8>msgodset first team in 2012, aged 13.

In January 2014, it was agreed that 15-year-old <U+00D8>degaard would be part of Str<U+00F8>msgodset's first team in 2014, but no professional contract was signed.

==Playing style==
An article in the ''[[Liverpool Echo]]'' described <U+00D8>degaard  as "an attack-minded midfielder very much in the modern mould. Diminutive, quick-footed, with natural balance, pace and, perhaps surprisingly for one so young, excellent shooting power".<ref name=profile/> [[David Nielsen]], his manager at Str<U+00F8>msgodset, likened him to [[David Silva]] and [[Lionel Messi]]. Amidst transfer speculation in December 2014, he opined that the player would develop better with a second season in Norway.<ref name=profile>{{cite news|last1=Kay|first1=Dan|title=Martin Odegaard profile: Meet the Norwegian wonderkid interesting Liverpool FC|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/martin-odegaard-profile-meet-norwegian-8233188|accessdate=10 February 2015|work=Liverpool Echo|date=5 December 2014}}</ref>

In September 2014, international teammate [[Morten Gamst Pedersen]] dubbed <U+00D8>degaard the most talented player he had ever seen, saying "For his age he is unbelievable <U+2013> his knowledge of the game is unbelievable and his technical skills are fantastic". Pedersen also stated that <U+00D8>degaard needed time to improve at the physical aspects of the sport.<ref name=pedersen/>

When describing his son, [[Hans Erik <U+00D8>degaard]] said, "It's the pace of the game that makes the difference in adjusting to different levels. We've used so many hours in working with his first and second touch to take off the pressure. We have worked a lot on bringing the ball closely to his feet, so he can change direction quickly, so even if he's physically weaker than the others he doesn't get caught because he's able to get away."<ref>{{cite web|title=Martin Odegaard: European football's most coveted 15-year-old|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2014/09/10/sport/football/martin-odegaard-norway-football/|website=http://edition.cnn.com|accessdate=15 December 2014}}</ref>

After <U+00D8>degaard  signed for Real Madrid, Norwegian former football scout [[Tor-Kristian Karlsen]] praised his mentality, stating that he had "overcome every challenge in front of him". Karlsen called him "so level-headed and mature" and noted his intelligence and performance at school, while also saying that this could be a disadvantage as "The best footballers tend to have a bit of needle, a bit of fire".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Macintosh|first1=Iain|title=Martin Odegaard can thrive at Real Madrid under Zinedine Zidane|url=http://www.espnfc.com/club/real-madrid/86/blog/post/2259309/martin-odegaard-can-thrive-at-real-madrid-under-zinedine-zidane|accessdate=10 February 2015|work=ESPN|date=22 January 2015}}</ref> While former Norway international [[Jan Aage Fjortoft]] was supportive of the transfer to Real Madrid due to the opportunity to learn from Zidane, he warned that at the age of 16 he needed time to develop: "Comparing <U+00D8>degaard to Messi is nonsense from the media. Messi is a player who can make the difference and Martin can do the same, but any comparisons should not be taken seriously".<ref>{{cite news|title=Don't compare Odegaard to Messi, says Fjortoft|url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/596/exclusive/2015/01/26/8311732/dont-compare-odegaard-to-messi-says-fjortoft|accessdate=10 February 2015|work=Goal.com|date=26 January 2015}}</ref>
