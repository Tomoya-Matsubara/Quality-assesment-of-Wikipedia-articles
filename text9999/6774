'''Weather buoys''' are instruments which collect [[weather]] and [[ocean]] data within the world's oceans, as well as aiding during emergency response to [[chemical accident|chemical spill]]s, [[trial|legal proceeding]]s, and [[engineering design process|engineering design]].  Moored [[buoy]]s have been in used since 1951, while drifting buoys have been used since 1979.  Moored buoys are connected with the ocean bottom using either [[chain]]s, [[nylon]], or buoyant [[polypropylene]].  With the decline of the [[weather ship]], they have taken a more primary role in measuring conditions over the open seas since the 1970's.  During the 1980s and 1990s, a network of buoys in the central and eastern tropical Pacific ocean helped study the [[El Ni<U+00F1>o-Southern Oscillation]].  Moored weather buoys range from {{convert|1.5|m|ft}} to {{convert|12|m|ft}} in diameter, while drifting buoys are smaller, with diameters of {{convert|30|cm|in}} to {{convert|40|cm|in}}.  Drifting buoys are the dominant form of weather buoy in sheer number, with 1250 located worldwide.  [[Wind]] data from buoys has smaller error than that from ships.  There are differences in the values of [[sea surface temperature]] measurements between the two platforms as well, relating to the depth of the measurement and whether or not the water is heated by the ship which measures the quantity.

The first known proposal for [[surface weather observation]]s at sea occurred in connection with aviation in August 1927, when Grover Loening stated that "weather stations along the ocean coupled with the development of the [[seaplane]] to have an equally long range, would result in regular ocean flights within ten years."<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ICoDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA121&dq=weather+ship+network+book&hl=en&ei=TA82TaODHYO0lQfD_rn5Cw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=9&ved=0CFEQ6AEwCDgU#v=onepage&q=weather%20ship%20network%20book&f=false|page=121|date=August 1927|accessdate=2011-01-18|journal=Popular Science|publisher=Popular Science Publishing Company, Inc.|volume=111|number=2|title=The First Plane to Germany|author=George Lee Dowd, Jr.}}</ref> Starting in 1939, [[United States Coast Guard]] vessels were being used as weather ships to protect transatlantic air commerce.<ref name="cg">{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=T5A9LCujs08C&pg=PA129&lpg=PA129&dq=weather+ship+book&source=bl&ots=G7-lIok3VQ&sig=kzpixxcNE3S7GxswCW8-YOwooIM&hl=en&ei=ybk1TaXBDcfTgQfUleyqCw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBUQ6AEwADgU#v=onepage&q=weather%20ship%20book&f=false|pages=127-130|author=Malcolm Francis Willoughby|title=The U.S. Coast Guard in World War II|publisher=|date=|ISBN=|accessdate=2011-01-18}}</ref>  The Navy Oceanographic Meteorological Automatic Device (NOMAD) buoy's {{convert|6|m|ft|adj=on}} hull was originally designed in the 1940<U+2019>s for the [[United States Navy]]<U+2019>s offshore data collection program.

==Instrumentation==
{{See also|Weather station}}
Weather buoys, like other types of weather stations, measure parameters such as [[air temperature]] above the ocean surface, [[wind]] speed (steady and gusting), [[barometric pressure]], and wind direction.  Since they lie in oceans and lakes, they also measure [[water]] temperature, [[wave height]], and dominant [[wave period]].<ref name="NDBC"/>  Raw data is processed and can be logged on board the buoy and then transmitted via radio, cellular, or [[satellite communications]] to [[meteorological]] centers for use in weather forecasting and climate study.  Both moored buoys and drifting buoys (drifting in the open ocean currents) are used.  Fixed buoys measure the water temperature at a depth of {{convert|3|m|ft}}.<ref name="buoy"/>  Many different drifting buoys exist around the world that vary in design and the location of reliable temperature sensors varies.  These measurements are beamed to satellites for automated and immediate data distribution.<ref name="buoy">{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=hH2NkL_318wC&pg=PA263&dq=sea+surface+temperature+forecasting+numerical+weather+prediction+book&hl=en&ei=ZL8pTa2LHYGclgeDm_mUAg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=sea%20surface%20temperature%20forecasting%20numerical%20weather%20prediction%20book&f=false|pages=237<U+2013>238|title=Oceanography from Space: Revisited|author=Vittorio Barale|year=2010|accessdate=2011-01-09|ISBN=9789048186808|publisher=Springer}}</ref>  Other than their use as a source of meteorological data, their data is used within research programs, emergency response to chemical spills, legal proceedings, and engineering design.<ref name="NDBC"/> Moored weather buoys can also act as a navigational aid, like other types of buoys.

==Types==
[[File:Mooredbuoytypes.gif|thumb|right|Types of moored buoys used by the National Data Buoy Center]]
Weather buoys can be recognized by their yellow color and flashing yellow light at night, and range in diameter from {{convert|1.5|m|ft}} to {{convert|12|m|ft}}.  Those that are placed in shallow waters are smaller in size and moored using only chains, while those in deeper waters use a combination of chains, nylon, and buoyant polypropylene.<ref name="NDBC">{{cite web|url=http://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/mooredbuoy.shtml|title=Moored Buoy Program|author=[[National Data Buoy Center]]|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|date=2008-02-04|accessdate=2011-01-29}}</ref>  Discus buoys are round and moored in deep ocean locations, with a diameter of {{convert|10|m|ft}} to {{convert|12|m|ft}}.<ref name="moor">{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=qXxIieLNl2gC&pg=PA13&dq=weather+buoy+book&hl=en&ei=oupBTa_eO9DTgAf5xpCFAg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CEAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=weather%20buoy%20book&f=false|title=The Sailor's Weather Guide|author=Jeff Markell|page=13|publisher=Sheridan House, Inc.|date=2003|accessdate=2011-01-27|ISBN=9781574091588}}</ref>  The aluminum {{convert|3|m|ft|adj=on|0}} buoy is a very rugged meteorological ocean platform that has long term survivability.  The expected service life of the {{convert|3|m|ft|adj=on|0}} platform is in excess of 20&nbsp;years and properly maintained, these buoys have not been retired due to corrosion.  The NOMAD is a unique moored aluminum environmental monitoring buoy designed for deployments in extreme conditions near the coast and across the [[Great Lakes]].<ref name="moor"/>  NOMADs moored off the Canadian coast commonly experience winter storms with maximum wave heights approaching {{convert|20|m|ft}}.

Drifting buoys are smaller than their moored counterparts, measuring {{convert|30|cm|in}} to {{convert|40|cm|in}} in diameter.  They are made of plastic or fiberglass, and tend to be either bi-colored, with white on one half and another color on the other half of the float, or solidly black or blue.  It measures a smaller subset of meteorological variables when compared to its moored counterpart, with a barometer measuring pressure in a tube on its top.  They have a thermistor (metalic thermometer) on its base, and an underwater [[drogue]], or sea anchor, located {{convert|15|m|ft}} below the ocean surface connected with the buoy by a long, thin tether.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/phod/dac/gdp_drifter.php|publisher=The Global Drifter Program|author=R.

==Comparison to data from ships==
Wind reports from moored buoys have smaller error than those from ships.  Complicating the comparison of the two measurements are that NOMAD buoys report winds at a height of {{convert|5|m|ft}}, while ships report winds from a height of {{convert|20|m|ft}} to {{convert|40|m|ft}}.<ref>{{cite journal|url=ftp://ftp.wmo.int/Documents/PublicWeb/amp/mmop/documents/JCOMM-TR/J-TR-13-Marine-Climatology/REV1/joc1176.pdf|journal=International Journal of Climatology|volume=25|pages=979-995|doi=10.1002/joc.1176|date=2005|acccesdate=2011-01-29|author=Bridget R.
