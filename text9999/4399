'''Michael B. Matusow''' (born April 30, 1968 in [[Los Angeles, California]]) is an American professional [[poker]] player, residing in [[Henderson, Nevada]]. Matusow's nickname of "The Mouth" reflects his reputation for trash-talking at the poker table. He is also known for sometimes ruining hours or days of good play with a single spectacular misjudgment, (known as a "Mike Matusow Blow-up" or "Mike Matusow Meltdown").<ref name="pokerlistings">{{cite web|url=http://www.pokerlistings.com/poker-player_mike-matusow?show=bio|title=Mike Matusow - Poker Player Profile|publisher=www.PokerListings.com|author=Anonymous|accessdate=2006-08-06}}</ref> Matusow began playing poker seriously in the early 1990s, first while working as a [[poker dealer]], then as a professional player.<ref name="fulltiltprofile">{{cite web|url=http://www.fulltiltpoker.com/mikeMatusow.php|title=Mike Matusow|publisher=[[Full Tilt Poker]]|author=Anonymous|accessdate=2006-08-06}}</ref> His successes include being a three-time [[World Series of Poker]] bracelet winner,<ref name="99wsop3500">{{cite web|url=http://pokerdb.thehendonmob.com/event.php?a=r&n=7856|title=1999 World Series of Poker $3,500 No Limit Hold 'em event results|publisher=[[The Hendon Mob]]|author=Butt, Robert|accessdate=2006-08-06}}</ref><ref name="02omahahilo">{{cite web|url=http://pokerdb.thehendonmob.com/event.php?a=r&n=4416|title=2002 World Series of Poker $5,000 Omaha hi/lo event results|publisher=The Hendon Mob|author=Butt, Robert|accessdate=2006-08-06}}</ref><ref name="08wsop27" /> and the winner of the 2005 [[World Series of Poker Tournament of Champions]].<ref name="05wsoptoc">{{cite web|url=http://pokerdb.thehendonmob.com/event.php?a=r&n=14994|title=2005 World Series of Poker Tournament of Champions results|publisher=The Hendon Mob|author=Butt, Robert|accessdate=2006-08-06}}</ref>

==Early years==
Matusow suffered from [[bullying]] when going through school and did not attend college. He attempted to get work as an [[auto mechanic]], but did not complete the required studying for the job. He later worked at his family's furniture store.<ref name="ppm">{{cite news | last = Kaplan | first = Michael | title = Me and My Big Mouth | date = August 2006 | url = http://www.totalgambler.com/theplayers/playerinterviews/1259/me_and_my_big_mouth.html |Total Gambler | accessdate = 2007-06-01}}</ref> Matusow's first experience of poker was playing [[video poker]] in the [[Westin Causarina Las Vegas Hotel, Casino & Spa|Maxim Casino]] at the age of 18, which he played regularly, to the extent he suffered from [[repetitive strain injury]] in his shoulders and arms.
