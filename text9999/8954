==Etymology==
The name Rujm el-Hiri was originally obtained from [[Syria]]n maps.<ref name=IESp194>Israel Exploration Society, 1996, p. 194.</ref> Translated from Arabic into English, it means, "the stone heap of the wild cat."<ref name=Oconnorp457>Murphy-O'Connor, 2007, [http://books.google.ca/books?id=zCJbd9UxrlIC&pg=RA6-PA457&dq=%22rujm+el-hiri%22#v=onepage&q=%22rujm%20el-hiri%22&f=false p. 457].</ref> The term ''[[rujm]]'' in Arabic (pl. ''rujum''; Hebrew: ''rogem'') can also refer to a [[tumulus]], a heap of stones underneath which human burial space was located.<ref name=Negevp518>Negev and Gibson, 2005, [http://books.google.ca/books?id=27nq65cZUIgC&pg=PA518&dq=%22rujm+el-hiri%22&lr=#v=onepage&q=%22rujm%20el-hiri%22&f=false p. 518].</ref>

Rogem Hiri is the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] pronunciation of the Arabic name, Rujm el-Hiri.<ref name=Oconnorp457/><ref name=MFA/> More recently, another Hebrew name for the site is also being used: Gilgal Refaim (''Gilgal Ref<U+0101>'<U+012B>m'' or ''Galgal Ref<U+0101>'<U+012B>m'', "Wheel of Refaim").<ref name=Haaretz/> ''Refa'im'' in modern Hebrew means "ghosts" or "spirits". The same root underlies the word used in the [[Tanakh]] to refer to a race of giants, the "[[Rephaite]]s", described as the ancient people of the [[Bashan]] (modern Golan).

==Structure and description==
The site's dimensions and its location on a wide plateau scattered with hundreds of [[dolmen]]s, means that an aerial perspective allows for a fuller appreciation of its layout.<ref name=Negevp443/> From above one can see a large circle (slightly oval) of [[basalt]] rocks, containing four smaller, concentric circles, that get progressively thinner, with some complete, others incomplete.<ref name=Rugglesp366>Ruggles, 2005, [http://books.google.ca/books?id=Q9YYqiXm-lkC&pg=PA366&lpg=PA366&dq=%22rujm+el-hiri%22+syria&source=bl&ots=aCosZPLl0i&sig=f-DB-zVEaKrj3-CYbFlYMR8NqQ4&hl=en&ei=riKTSvG9EZrMjAfelPHbDQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1#v=onepage&q=%22rujm%20el-hiri%22&f=false p. 366].</ref> The walls of the circles are connected by irregularly placed smaller stone walls.<ref name=Rugglesp366/>

Basalt rocks are common in the Golan Heights, due to the region's history of [[volcano|volcanic]] activity. Described as the "[[Stonehenge]] of the [[Levant]]," the site is made up of 37,500 metric tons of partly worked stone stacked up to {{m to ft|2}} high.<ref name=Avenip323>Aveni, 2001, [http://books.google.ca/books?id=JDBu_x6vlZ4C&pg=PA323&dq=%22rujm+el-hiri%22+stonehenge&lr=#v=onepage&q=%22rujm%20el-hiri%22%20stonehenge&f=false p. 323].</ref> A central tumulus {{ft to m|65}} in diameter and {{ft to m|15}} high is surrounded by concentric circles, the outermost of which is {{ft to m|520}} in diameter and {{ft to m|8}} high.<ref name="Negevp443"/> Two entrances to the site face the northeast ({{m to ft|29}} wide) and southeast ({{m to ft|26}} wide).<ref name=Negevp443/><ref name=Oconnorp478>Murphy-O'Connor, 2008, p. 478.</ref> The northeast entrance leads to an accessway {{ft to m|20}} long leading to the center of the circle which seems to point in the general direction of the [[Solstice|June solstice]] sunrise.<ref name=Avenip323/><ref name=Oconnorp478/> The axis of the tomb discovered at the site's center is similarly aligned.<ref name=Avenip323/>

The central tumulus (or tomb) is built from smaller rocks and is thought to have been constructed about 150 years after the surrounding walls were constructed.<ref name=Avenip323/> Connecting to it are four main stone walls. The first wall, shaped like a semicircle, is 50m in diameter and 1.5m wide. That wall is connected to a second one, an almost complete circle 90m in diameter. The third wall is a full circle, 110m in diameter and 2.6m wide. The fourth and outermost wall is the largest: 150m in diameter and 3.2m wide.

==History and purpose==
The site was cataloged during an [[Archaeology of Israel|Israeli archaeological survey]] carried out in 1967-68<ref name=Negevp443/> after the [[Golan Heights]] were [[Israeli-occupied territories|occupied]] by [[Israel]] from [[Syria]] in the [[Six-Day War|1967 war]]. It figured on Syrian maps and a Syrian [[Triangulation station|triangulation post]] was found on top of its [[cairn]].<ref name=IESp194/> After initial research the site was mostly abandoned, the first professional [[Archeology|archaeological excavation]]s of it began in the 1980s, when it became the focus of interest for scientists and researchers, following the work of Professors [[Moshe Kochavi]] and [[Yoni Mizrachi]].

Due to the site's age and its deteriorated state, having been weathered by the elements, its purpose remains unclear. However, one fact is accepted among all researchers - at some point in history the site served as a place of worship and tribal gatherings. In the site's center, inside the Dolman, researchers found an ancient tomb, filled with jewelry and other expensive objects. The tomb was dated to the end of the [[second millennium BCE]]. The structure itself predates the tomb, and thus the people who buried the individual there are not the site's original builders.

===Main hypotheses ===
*'''Burial site''', for leaders or other important individuals. Supporting this theory was the tomb in the Dolman. However, no human remains were found, only objects pointing to its function as a tomb. Also, even if it were a tomb, that was not the site's original function, as the tomb is a 1,000 years newer than the site itself.
*'''Worship''' - According to this hypothesis, supported by a large part of the researchers, the site was used for special ceremonies during the longest and shortest days of the year. It seems, that on the year [[3rd millennium BC|3000 BCE]], on the longest day, the first rays of the sun shone through the opening in the north-east gate, which is 20 by 29 metres. However, they did not shine in a perfect angle. It is assumed this is because the builders of those days didn't have sufficiently accurate architectural tools. The resident probably used the site to worship [[Tammuz (deity)|Tammuz]] and [[Ishtar]], the gods of fertility, to thank them for the good harvest during the year. After the erection of the tomb in the center, the rays' path was blocked.

*'''Calendar''' - Some believe the site was used an as ancient [[calendar]]. Although the site could not be used to calculate an exact date, it was sufficient for the people's needs. At the times of the two [[equinox]]es, the sun's rays would pass between two rocks, 2m in height, 5m in width, at the eastern edge of the compound. This way, they could know when the first rains would come, and determine the right time to sow or reap their crops.

*'''Astronomical observations''' - Perhaps the site was used for [[Astronomy|astronomical]] observations of the [[constellation]]s, probably for [[Religion|religious]] calculations. Researchers found the site was built with dimensions and scales common for other period structures, and partly based on the stars' positions. However, they could not explain a large part of the structure, including the smaller walls connecting the circles.

*'''A placemark''' - Perhaps the mark is intended to mark the place.  Modern placemarks are abundant, and required for many purposes, such as land and nation borders.  Similar purposes in antiquity would have required marking places also.

==Today==
[[New Age]] movements advocating a return to nature gather at the site on the summer [[solstice]] and on the equinox to view the first rays of the sun shine though the rocks. {{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} In 2007, the site was excavated by Yosef Garfinkel and Michael Fraikhman of the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]].
