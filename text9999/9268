[[Image:Mendip Hills Map.png|thumb|250px|Topographic map of the Mendips]]
'''The Mendip Hills''' (commonly called '''The Mendips''') are a range of [[limestone]] hills situated to the south of [[Bristol]] and [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] in [[Somerset]], [[England]]. Running east to west between [[Weston-super-Mare]] and [[Frome]], the Hills overlook the [[Somerset Levels]] to the south and the [[River Avon, Bristol|Avon valley]] to the north. The hills give their name to the local government district of [[Mendip]], which covers most of the area.

The hills are largely [[carboniferous limestone]], which is quarried at several sites. The higher western part of the Hills, have been designated as an [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]] (AONB), with an area of {{Unit area|sqkm|200|-1}}, which gives it the same level of protection as a [[national park]]. The Mendip Hills AONB Service and Somerset County Council's outdoor education centre is at the [[Charterhouse, Somerset|Charterhouse]] Centre near [[Blagdon]]. 

The Mendips are home to a wide range of outdoor sports and leisure activities many based on the particular [[geology]] of the area. It is recognised as a national centre for [[caving]] and [[cave diving]]. In addition to [[climbing]] and [[abseiling]], the area is popular with [[Hillwalking|hillwalkers]] and those interested in [[natural history]].

== Etymology ==

Several explanations for the name "Mendip" have been suggested. One suggestion is that it is derived from the [[mediaeval]] term "Myne-deepes".<ref name="EN">{{cite web | title= Mendip Hills Natural Area profile |publisher = English Nature | url= http://www.english-nature.org.uk/science/natural/profiles%5CnaProfile84.pdf | format = PDF | date = January 1998 | accessdate=2006-07-16}}</ref> 
An alternative explanation is that the name is cognate with ''Mened'' (Welsh ''mynydd''), a [[Brythonic]] term for upland moorland. The suffix may be a contraction of the [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] ''hop'' meaning a valley. Two possible further meanings have been identified. The first is 'the stone pit' from the [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] ''meyn'' and ''dyppa'' in reference to the collapsed cave systems of [[Cheddar]]. The second is 'Mighty and Awesome' from the [[Old English language|Old English]] ''moen'' and ''deop''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Robinson |first=Stephen |title=Somerset Place Names |year=1992 |publisher=The Dovecote Press Ltd |location=Wimbourne |isbn=1874336032}}</ref>

==Geology==
The Mendip Hills are the most southerly Carboniferous Limestone Upland in Britain. The rock [[strata]] known as the [[Carboniferous Limestone]] were laid down during the [[Early Carboniferous]] Period, about 320<U+2013>350 million years ago. Subsequently, much of northwestern Europe underwent [[continental collision]] throughout the late [[Paleozoic]] era, culminating in the final phases of the [[Variscan orogeny]] near the end of the Carboniferous Period, 300 million years ago. This [[tectonic]] activity produced a complex suite of mountain and hill ranges across what is now [[Republic of Ireland|southern Ireland]], south western England, [[Brittany]], and elsewhere in [[western Europe]].

As a result of the Variscan mountain-building, the area now comprises three major [[anticline|anticlinal]] [[Fold (geology)|fold]] structures, each with a core of older [[Devonian]] [[sandstone]] and [[Silurian]] [[Volcanism|volcanic]] rocks. The latter are quarried for use in road construction and as a [[concrete]] aggregate.<ref name="EN" /> 200 to 300 million years ago the Mendips were considerably higher and steeper than they are today.<ref name="Barrington">{{cite book |last=Barrington |first=Nicholas |authorlink= |coauthors=Stanton, William |title=Mendip: The Complete Caves and a View of the Hills |year=1977 |publisher=Cheddar Valley Press |location= Cheddar |isbn=0950145920}}</ref>  Since then, weathering has resulted in a range of surface features, including [[Canyon|gorges]], dry valleys, [[scree]]s and [[Sinkhole|swallets]]. These are complemented underground by a large number of [[Caves of the Mendip Hills|caves]], including [[Wookey Hole]], both beneath the [[plateau]] and at the base of the southern [[escarpment]]. There are also [[limestone pavement]]s and other [[karst]] features. Karstic dissolution of the limestone produced many of the gorges including, most famously, [[Cheddar Gorge and Caves|Cheddar Gorge]] and [[Burrington Combe]]. [[spring (hydrosphere)|Springs]], a number of which deposit [[tufa]], are a particular feature of the eastern part of the hills.<ref name="EN" />

The Devonian and Silurian rocks are generally more resistant to weathering and form some of the highest points on the hills, including the highest point at [[Beacon Batch]] on [[Black Down, Somerset|Black Down]] which is 325&nbsp;metres (1068&nbsp;ft) above sea level. Black Down is a [[moorland]] area, with its steeper slopes covered in [[bracken]] (''Pteridium'') and its flatter [[Summit (topography)|summit]] in [[Calluna|heather]] (''Calluna'') and grasses rather than the [[pasture]] which covers much of the plateau. The main body of the range is an extended plateau, 6&ndash;8&nbsp;km (4&ndash;5&nbsp;miles) wide and generally about 240&nbsp;metres (800&nbsp;ft) above sea level. 

In some areas the Carboniferous Limestone and the [[Dolomite|Dolomitic]] [[Conglomerate (geology)|Conglomerate]] have been mineralised with [[lead]] and [[zinc]] [[ore]]s. From the time of the [[Roman Britain|Romans]] until 1908, the hills were an important source of lead.<ref name="TOULSON">{{cite book |last=Toulson |first=Shirley |title=The Mendip Hills: A Threatened Landscape |year=1984 |publisher=Victor Gollancz |location=London |isbn=057503453X }}</ref> 
These areas were the centre of a major [[mining]] industry in the past and this is reflected in areas of contaminated rough ground known locally as "gruffy". The word "gruffy" is thought to derive from the grooves that were formed where the lead ore was extracted from veins near the surface.<ref name="COYSH">{{cite book |last=Coysh |first=A.W. |coauthors= E.J. Mason & V. Waite |title=The Mendips |year=1977 |publisher=Robert Hale Ltd |location=London |isbn=0709164262 }}</ref> 
Other commodities obtained included [[Calamine (mineral)|calamine]], [[manganese]], [[iron]], [[copper]] and [[barytes]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Gough |first=J.W. |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=The mines of Mendip |year=1967 |publisher=David & Charles |location=Newton Abbot|id=http://www.amazon.co.uk/o/ASIN/B0000CNKWB }}</ref> 
The eastern area reaches into parts of the [[Somerset coalfield]].

North and east of the Mendips, the same Carboniferous Limestone layers are found in the subsurface and are exposed in [[Avon Gorge]], but younger strata overlie the Carboniferous Limestone in [[Dundry Down|Dundry Hill]] and the [[Cotswolds]],<ref>{{cite web | title= Cotswold Hills Geopark | url= http://www.cotswoldhillsgeopark.org/ | accessdate=2007-05-05}}</ref> where the [[Oolite|Oolitic Limestone]] of [[Jurassic]] age is found at the surface.

== Climate ==
Along with the rest of [[South West England]], the Mendip Hills has a [[temperate|temperate climate]] which is generally wetter and milder than the rest of [[England]]. The annual mean temperature is approximately 10&nbsp;<U+00B0>C (50&nbsp;<U+00B0>F) and shows a [[seasonal]] and a [[Diurnal motion|diurnal]] variation, but due to the modifying effect of the sea the range is less than in most other parts of the UK. January is the coldest month with mean minimum temperatures between 1&nbsp;<U+00B0>C (34&nbsp;<U+00B0>F) and 2&nbsp;<U+00B0>C (36&nbsp;<U+00B0>F). July and August are the warmest months in the region with mean daily maxima around 21&nbsp;<U+00B0>C (70&nbsp;<U+00B0>F). In general December is the dullest month and June the sunniest. The south west of England has a favoured location with respect to the [[Azores]] high pressure when it extends its influence north-eastwards towards the UK, particularly in summer.

[[Cumulus cloud|Cloud]] often forms inland, especially near hills, and acts to reduce sunshine amounts. The average annual sunshine totals around 1600 hours. [[Precipitation (meteorology)|Rainfall]] tends to be associated with [[Atlantic]] [[Low pressure area|depressions]] or with convection. In summer, convection caused by solar surface heating sometimes forms shower [[cloud]]s and a large proportion of rainfall falls from showers and [[thunderstorms]] at this time of year. Average rainfall is around 800&ndash;900&nbsp;mm (31&ndash;35&nbsp;in). About 8&ndash;15 days of [[snowfall]] is typical. November to March have the highest mean [[wind]] speeds, with June to August having the lightest winds. The predominant wind direction is from the South West.<ref>{{cite web | title=About south-west England | publisher=Met Office |url=http://www.metoffice.com/climate/uk/location/southwestengland/index.html | accessdate=2006-05-21}}</ref>

A combination of the rainfall and geology leads to an estimated average daily [[Surface runoff|runoff]] from [[Spring (hydrosphere)|springs]] and [[Water well|boreholes]] of some 330,000&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup> (72 million imperial gallons). Bristol Waterworks Company (now [[Bristol Water]]) recognised the value of this resource and between 1846 and 1853 created a series of underground tunnels, pipes and [[aqueduct]]s called the "Line of Works" which still carry approximately 18,200&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup> (4 million imperial gallons) of water a day to [[Barrow Gurney Reservoirs]] for [[filtration]] and then on to Bristol and the surrounding areas. All this is done by [[gravity]] as it collects and conveys water from the [[Chewton Mendip]] and [[East Harptree|East]] and [[West Harptree]] areas.<ref name="Barrington"/>

==Ecology==
[[Image:Peregrine falcon x.jpg|thumb|Peregrine Falcon]]
There are three nationally important semi-natural [[Habitat (ecology)|habitats]] which are characteristic of the area: [[Ash tree|Ash]]-[[Maple]] woodland (''Fraxinus'' spp. and ''Acer'' spp.) often with abundant [[small-leaved lime]] (''Tilia cordata''), [[Calcareous grassland]] and [[Mesotrophic grasslands in the British National Vegetation Classification system|Mesotrophic grassland]].<ref name="EN" />

Much of the Mendip Hills is open [[calcareous grassland]] which supports a large [[biodiversity|variety]] of wild [[flowering plant]]s and [[insects]]. Grazing by [[rabbit]]s (''Oryctolagus cuniculus''), [[sheep]] (''Ovis aries'') and [[cattle]] (''Bos taurus'') maintains the grassland habitat. Some of the area is [[deciduous]] [[ancient woodland]]. Some of the area has been used intensively for [[arable]] [[agriculture]], particularly since [[World War I]]. Some of this land is now being returned to grassland as the demand for arable land in Britain declines, but the use of [[fertilisers]] and [[herbicides]] have reduced the [[biodiversity]] in these areas.<ref name="EN" />

Many [[bird]] species can also be found. Of particular significance is the [[Peregrine Falcon]] (''Falco peregrinus'') which has gradually recolonised the Mendips since the 1980s. It breeds on sea and inland cliffs and also on the faces of both active and disused quarries. The upland heaths of the west Mendips have recently increased in ornithological importance, due to colonisation by the [[Dartford Warbler]] (''Sylvia undata''), which can be found for example at [[Black Down]] and [[Crook Peak to Shute Shelve Hill|Crook Peak]]. In Britain, this species is usually associated with lowland heath. The woodlands at [[Stock Hill]] are a breeding site for [[European Nightjar|Nightjar]] (''Caprimulgus europaeus'') and [[Long-eared Owl]] (''Asio otus''). The Waldegrave Pool, part of [[Priddy Mineries]] is an important site for [[dragonflies]], including [[Downy Emerald]] (''Cordulia aenea'')(the only Mendip breeding site for this species) and [[Four-spotted Chaser]] (''Libellula quadrimaculata'').<ref name="EN" />

A range of important small [[mammals]] are found in the area including the [[Hazel Dormouse]] (''Muscardinus avellanarius'') which is restricted largely to [[coppice]] woodland and scrub, [[Bats]] including the nationally rare [[Lesser Horseshoe Bat|lesser]] (''Rhinolophus hipposideros'') and [[Greater Horseshoe Bat]]s (''Rhinolophus ferrumequinum'') which have a number of colonies in buildings, caves and mines in the area.. A rare and endangered species, the greater horseshoe bat is protected under the [[Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981]] and is listed in Annex II of the 1992 [[European Community Habitats Directive]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Compton Martin Ochre Mine | publisher=English Nature | url=http://www.english-nature.org.uk/citation/citation_photo/1004205.pdf | format = PDF | date = [[14 October]] [[1996]] | accessdate=2006-05-09}}</ref> 
Amphibians such as the [[Great crested newt]] (''Triturus cristatus'') have a wide distribution across Mendip and are often found in flooded disused quarries.
[[Image:Maculinea arion by Paolo Mazzei 01.jpg|thumb|left|Large Blue Butterfly]]

Several rare [[butterflies]] are also indigenous to the area. The [[Large blue butterfly]] (''Maculinea arion'') became extinct in the late 1970s since when a research project has been undertaken into its ecology and reintroduction. Other species include the nationally scarce [[Pearl-bordered Fritillary]] (''Boloria euphrosyne''), [[Hamearis lucina|Duke of Burgandy]] (''Hamearis lucina'') and [[White-letter Hairstreak]] (''Satyrium w-album'').<ref name="EN" /> 
The [[White-clawed crayfish]] is also nationally rare and a declining species with small populations in a tributary of the [[Mells River]] and the [[River Chew]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Award for bridge restoration team | publisher=BANES | url=http://www.bathnes.gov.uk/BathNES/media/news/2006/November/bridgeawardstory.Inform39 | date = [[23 November]] [[2006]] | accessdate=2006-11-24}}</ref>

A well known Mendip feature is the [[Dry stone|dry stone walls]] which fragment the pasture into fields. Constructed from local limestone and in an "A frame" design, the walls are strong yet contain no mortar. Unfortunately years of neglect are allowing many walls to disintegrate, being replaced or contained by a mix of barbed wire and sheep fencing. These dry-stone walls are of botanical importance, supporting important populations of the nationally scarce [[Wall Whitlow-grass]]. Amongst the plants which occur in the area are the [[Dianthus|Cheddar pink]] (''Dianthus''), [[Lithospermum purpurocaeruleum|Purple gromwell]] (''Lithospermum purpurocaeruleum''), [[White rock-rose]] (''Helianthemum apenninum''), [[Somerset hair-grass]] and [[Starved wood-sedge]].<ref name="EN" />

==History==
{{see also|Mining in Roman Britain}}
[[Image:Charterhouseleadmines.jpg|thumb|Roman lead mines at [[Charterhouse]].]]
There are twenty identified [[Palaeolithic]] sites in the Mendips, including eleven representing material recovered from cave sites, including [[Faunal stage|faunal]] remains and [[Lithic stage|lithic]] [[Artifact (archaeology)|artefacts]], and eight relating to surface lithic discoveries. The material found includes handaxes, points and scrapers. Twenty&ndash;seven [[Mesolithic]] finds are represented by flint and chert lithics.<ref name="aggregate">{{cite web | title=The Aggregate Landscape of Somerset: Predicting the Archaeological Resource | publisher=Somerset County Council & English Heritage | url=http://www.somerset.gov.uk/media/087/B7/Report.pdf | format = PDF |accessdate=2007-02-14}}</ref> 
There have been large numbers of artefacts from [[Neolithic]], [[Iron Age]] and [[Bronze Age]] remains, including [[Tumulus|barrows]] and [[fort]]s, such as those around [[Priddy]] and at [[Dolebury Warren]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Adkins |first=Lesley and Roy  |title=A field guide to Somerset Archeology |year=1992 |publisher=Dovecote press |location=Wimbourne |isbn=0946159947}}</ref>

There are at present over 1200 entries on the [[National Monuments Record]] (NMR) for the Mendip Hills AONB and just over 600 [[listed building]] records,<ref>{{cite web | title=Project proposal: the historic environment of the Mendip Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty | publisher = English Heritage Research Department | url=http://www.mendiphillsaonb.org.uk/publications/up_120041_eh_project_design_revised_jan07(2).pdf |format = PDF | date = June 2006 | accessdate=2007-02-17}}</ref>

The caves of Cheddar Gorge in particular have preserved much [[archaeology]] as flood waters have washed artefacts into the caves and preserved them in silt. The [[Cheddar Man]] was found here.

Settlement on the Mendip Hills appears to fall into two types. The first, apparent in the Neolithic and Bronze Age periods, and repeated on a small scale in the [[medieval]] and post&ndash;medieval era, comprised occupation by self-sufficient groups in small communities or isolated farms. The second was represented in the Iron Age and [[Roman Empire|roman]] periods by large sites with specialist functions, existing by virtue of their ability to exert power over lowland producers. From the Iron Age onward the ownership of land took on increasing importance, with large landholdings based on the mines or on stock grazing, denying settlers access to the plateau or forcing them off the hills.<ref name="archeol"/>

There is evidence of [[mining]] dating back into the late Bronze Age when there were technological changes in metal working indicating the use of [[lead]]. The Roman invasion, and possibly the preceding period of involvement in the internal affairs of the south of England, was inspired, in part, by the potential of the Mendips. A great deal of the attraction of the lead mines may have been the potential for the extraction of [[silver]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Romano-British Somerset | work=Somerset County Council: History of Somerset | url=http://www.somerset.gov.uk/archives/ASH/Romano-brit.htm|accessdate=2006-10-29}}</ref> 
The [[Latin]] "EX ARG VEB" stamps on the Mendip [[Lead#History|lead pigs]] specify a de-silvering process and cast silver ingots have been found. The silver [[coin]]age of the [[Dobunni]] and [[Durotriges]] is likely to reflect the availability of silver from the mines. By the end of the medieval period a complex body of customary law had come into existence dealing with the four "Mendip mineries". That medieval control was in the hands of the [[monastic]] foundations may indicate some continuity of tenure of large scale holdings, focused on the mines, from the Roman period.<ref name="archeol"/>

When [[William Wilberforce]] visited Cheddar in 1789 and saw the poor circumstances of the locals, he inspired [[Hannah More]] to begin her work improving the conditions of the Mendip miners and agricultural workers.<ref name="COYSH" />  
Between 1770 and 1813, {{Unit area|ha|7300}} of land on the hills was enclosed, mainly with [[Dry stone|dry stone walls]], which today form a key part of the landscape. In 2006 funding was obtained to maintain and improve the dry stone walls.<ref>{{cite web | title=Lifelines - Mendip Hills AONB Dry Stone Wall Survey and Celebration | publisher=Mendip AONB | url=http://www.mendiphillsaonb.org.uk/publications/up_175815_lifelines-post_submission.doc | date = October 2005 | accessdate=2007-02-17}}</ref>
[[Image:beacon batch lowres.jpg|left|thumb|A view across Black Down from Beacon Batch]]
Over 300 "Mendip Motor Cars" were built by an enginering works based in [[Chewton Mendip]] in the years immediately before and after [[World War I]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Mendip Engineering Company Ltd. | publisher=British Motor Manufacturers 1894-1960 | url=http://www.britishmm.co.uk/history.asp?id=612 | accessdate=2007-02-25}}</ref><ref name="TOULSON" /> 
In [[World War II]] a bombing decoy was constructed on top of Black Down at [[Beacon Batch]] in an attempt to confuse bombers aiming to damage the city of Bristol, and piles of stones (known as [[cairn]]s) were created to prevent enemy aircraft using the hilltop as a landing site. Other high points include [[Bleadon Hill]] and [[North Hill]] near [[Priddy]]. The Mendip Hills are home to the [[Mendip TV Mast|Mendip UHF television transmitter]] installed in the 1960s, the tallest mast in the region which is situated on [[Pen Hill]] near [[Wells]].

Since 2003 arguments have raged over plans to erect a [[Wind Turbine]] near [[Chewton Mendip]]. The proposal was rejected by [[Mendip]] District Council, which enjoyed the support of a range of local groups and organisations, on the grounds that the environmental impact on the edge of the Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty outweighed the nominal amount of electricity which would be generated. In April 2006 a planning enquiry gave [[Ecotricity]] permission to build a 102&nbsp;m (335&nbsp;ft) turbine during the next year.<ref>{{cite web | title= Wind Turbine granted | url= http://www.mendip.gov.uk/NewsArticle.asp?id=SXEBCF-A7817219 | date = [[22 May]] [[2006]] | publisher = Mendip District Council | accessdate=2006-05-28}}</ref>

== Government and politics ==
[[Image:Mendiphillsaonb3.JPG|thumb|Logo of the Mendip Hills AONB at [[Burrington Combe]].]]
The western end of the Mendip Hills have, since 1972, been designated as an [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]] (AONB) under the [[National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949]]. The Mendip Society which was formed in 1965, work to raise awareness of the designation and protect the area. The society now has 700 members and runs a programme of guided walks, educative talks and visits. The society also has a small grants fund to assist communities with the conservation and enhancement of the landscape and to encourage its enjoyment and celebration.<ref>{{cite web | title=The Mendip Society website | url=http://www.mendipsociety.org.uk/ | accessdate=2007-02-17}}</ref>

As they have the same landscape quality, AONBs may be compared to the [[national parks of England and Wales]]. AONBs are created under the same legislation as the [[national park]]s, the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949. Unlike AONBs, national parks have their own authorities, have special legal powers to prevent unsympathetic development. By contrast, there are very limited statutory duties imposed on local authorities within an AONB. However, further regulation and protection of AONBs was added by the [[Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000]].

The Mendip Hills Partnership, which has an administrative role, includes the five local authorities that cover the AONB, statutory bodies such as the [[Countryside Agency]] and [[English Nature]] together with parish councils and other organisations and groups that have an interest in the conservation and care of the area. The Mendip Hills AONB Service is the staff unit of the partnership, and is based at the [[Charterhouse, Somerset|Charterhouse]] Centre in the heart of the AONB. The AONB Service consists of six staff, a manager, development officer, planning liaison officer, two wardens and a support officer. They are supported by 50 volunteer rangers who give approximately 3000 volunteer hours each year.<ref>{{cite web | title=The Mendip Hills AONB | url=http://www.mendiphillsaonb.org.uk/ | accessdate=2007-02-17}}</ref> 
In 2005 a proposal was submitted to the [[Countryside Agency]] to extend the Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty to [[Steep Holm]] and [[Brean Down]] in the west and towards [[Frome]] in the east.<ref>{{cite web | title=The Case for Extending the Mendip Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty | url= http://www.mendipsociety.org.uk/Issues/AONB_extension_case_Mar_2005.pdf | format = PDF | publisher = The Mendip Society | date = March 2005 | accessdate=2007-02-17}}</ref>

Many of the villages on the Mendips have their own [[parish council]]s which have some responsibility for local issues. They also elect councillors to district councils e.g. [[Mendip]] or [[Sedgemoor]] and [[Somerset|Somerset County Council]] or unitary authorities e.g. [[Bath and North East Somerset]], or [[North Somerset]]. Each of the villages is also part of a parliamentary constituency: [[Wells (UK Parliament constituency)|Wells]], [[Weston-super-Mare (UK Parliament constituency)|Weston-super-Mare]], or [[Wansdyke (UK Parliament constituency)|Wansdyke]] (which will become [[North East Somerset (UK Parliament constituency)|North East Somerset]]). The area is also part of the [[South West England (European Parliament constituency)]] of the European Parliament. [[Avon and Somerset Constabulary]] provides police services to the area.

==Demographics==

The population on the higher plateau is widely dispersed in small farms and hamlets, although many of the population in these settlements no longer work in [[agriculture]] or [[forestry]] but commute to surrounding cities and towns for employment. The largest villages on the plateau are [[Priddy]] and [[Charterhouse, Somerset|Charterhouse]].<ref name="EN" /> The larger villages and towns are on the lower slopes of the western hills, often in river valleys. [[Axbridge]], [[Cheddar]], [[Shepton Mallet]] and [[Wells]] are along the southern border of the hills and [[Blagdon]], [[Compton Martin]] and [[East Harptree|East]] and [[West Harptree]] along the northern edge.

== Transport and communications ==
[[Image:Pensfordviaduct.JPG|thumb|right|[[Pensford]] Viaduct]]
The ancient tracks across the hills were superseded in the middle of the [[first century]] by the Roman [[Fosse Way]] from Bath to [[Ilchester]], which served the [[Charterhouse, Somerset|Charterhouse]] lead mines, and can be traced in some of the local place names such as [[Stratton-on-the-Fosse]] and [[Lydford-on-Fosse]]. Much of the high plateau remained uncultivated and unenclosed until the [[eighteenth century]] resulting in many roads remaining as narrow winding lanes between high banks and hedges or stone walls, which become open roads with wide verges in places which had their origins as [[Drovers' road|drovers roads]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Atthill |first=Robin |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Mendip: A new study |year=1976 |publisher=David & Charles |location=Newton Abbott |isbn= 0715372971 }}</ref> The roads tend to follow the line of gorges and valleys as at [[Cheddar Gorge]].

More major roads often started as [[turnpikes]] in the 16th century and are found avoiding the highest areas. To the north of the western part of the Mendips the [[A368 road|A368]] separates the hills from the [[Chew Valley]], while on the southern edge the [[A371 road|A371]] similarly runs along the bottom of the scarp slope between the hills and the [[Somerset Levels]]. The western end of the hills is crossed by the [[M5 motorway]] and [[A38 road|A38]]. Further east, and running almost north to south are the [[A37 road|A37]] and [[A39 road|A39]].

During the late [[19th century|nineteenth]] and early [[twentieth century]] the [[Bristol and North Somerset Railway]] ran roughly parallel to the A37 but this closed in 1965. Further south and west the [[Cheddar Valley line]] and [[Wrington Vale Light Railway]], branches of the [[Bristol and Exeter Railway]], served towns and villages from [[Cheddar]] to [[Wells]]. These have all now closed, although [[Mendip Rail]] has freight lines to carry limestone from the [[Quarries of the Mendip Hills]]. The [[Somerset Coal Canal]] reached some of the pits of the [[Somerset coalfield]] in the eastern end of the Mendips.

== Quarrying ==
[[Image:Whatleyquarry.jpg|thumb|left|Western extension of [[Whatley quarry]].]]
:''Main article: [[Quarries of the Mendip Hills]]''

In recent centuries the hills, like the [[Cotswolds]] to the north, have been quarried for stone to build the cities of Bath and Bristol, as well as smaller towns in Somerset. The quarries are now major suppliers of road stone to southern England, between them producing around twelve million tonnes of limestone a year, employing over two thousand people and with an annual turnover of <U+00A3>150million.<ref>{{cite web | title=Mendip Quarry Producers | url=http://www.mendipquarries.co.uk/index.htm | accessdate=2007-02-02}}</ref>
[[Image:Cheddar.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|[[Cheddar Gorge]].]]
There are two main rock types on the Mendips: the [[Devonian]] [[Sandstones]] visible around [[Blackdown, Somerset|Blackdown]] and [[Downhead]] and the [[Carboniferous limestone|Carboniferous Limestones]], which dominate the hills and surround the older rock formations.<ref name="aggregate"/> There are nine active and a host of disused quarries, several of which have been designated as [[Site of Special Scientific Interest|Geological Sites of Special Scientific]] by [[English Nature]]. Because of the effect of the quarries on the environment and local communities, a campaign has been started to stop the creation of any new quarries and for restrictions to be placed on the existing ones.<ref>{{cite web | title=Quarrying Issues from the Mendip Socierty | url=http://www.mendipsociety.org.uk/Issues/body_issues.html#Quarrying | accessdate=2007-02-17}}</ref>

== Sport, leisure and tourism ==

The Mendips are home to a wide range of outdoor sports and leisure activities, including [[caving]], [[climbing]] and [[abseiling]]. The rich variety of [[fauna]] and [[flora]] also makes it attractive for [[hillwalking]] and those interested in [[natural history]]. There are a range of tourist attractions including [[Cheddar Gorge and Caves]], [[Wookey Hole]] and the small city of [[Wells]].

There is a [[gliding]] club at Halesland Airfield between [[Draycott, Somerset|Draycott]] and [[Priddy]]. The Mendips Raceway is a popular venue for [[stock-car racing]] near [[Shipham]]. The Mendips are also home to several festivals including the [[Big Green Gathering]], and a [[folk music]] festival and sheep fair in [[Priddy]].

===Caving and cave diving===
{{main|Caves of the Mendip Hills}}
[[Image:Goughscave.jpg|thumb|Stalagmites and Stalactites in [[Gough's Cave]]]]
The particular geology, within which large areas of limestone have been worn away by water, makes the hills a national centre for caving. Some of the caves have been known about since the establishment of the Mendip [[lead]] mining industry in [[Roman Empire|Roman]] times. However, many have only been discovered or explored in the 20th century.<ref>{{cite book |last=Johnson |first=Peter |title=The History of Mendip Caving |year=1967 |publisher=David & Charles |location=Newton Abbot |isbn= }}</ref> 
The caves which are easily accessible to the public are at [[Cheddar Gorge and Caves]] and [[Wookey Hole]], but specialist equipment and knowledge is required for the vast majority of the caves. The active Mendip Caving Group and other local caving organisations organise trips and continue to discover new caverns.

The Hills conceal the largest underground river system in Britain.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cheddarcaves.co.uk/facts/Fact%20Sheet%208%20-%20Rivers.pdf |format = PDF | date = 2001 |title= Fact Sheet 8: Rivers |accessdate=2007-01-27 |publisher= Cheddar Caves & Gorge }}</ref> 
Attempts to move from one cave to another through the underground rivers led to the development of [[cave diving]], with [[Swildon's Hole]] being the site of the first cave dive attempt in Britain, in 1934. The first successful cave dive in Britain was achieved the following year at [[Wookey Hole Caves]], where the last [[sump]] is currently the deepest in Britain at 76&nbsp;m (250&nbsp;ft).<ref>{{cite web | title=UK Caves Database |  url=http://www.ukcaves.co.uk/ | accessdate=2007-02-23}}</ref> The cave complexes at [[St. Dunstan's Well Catchment]], [[Lamb Leer]] and [[Priddy Caves]] have been identified as [[geological Site of Special Scientific Interest|geological Sites of Special Scientific Interest]].

===Walking===
 
Several sites on the Mendips are designated as [[Open Country|open access land]] and there are a myriad of [[Trail|footpaths]] and [[bridleways]] which are generally clearly marked.

Several long distance trails cross the area including:
* [[Mendip Way]] &mdash; 80&nbsp;km (50&nbsp;miles) long.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ramblers.org.uk/INFO/paths/mendip.html |title=Mendip Way |accessdate=2007-04-21 | publisher= The Ramblers Association }}</ref>  From [[Weston-super-Mare]] to [[Frome]]. The western section runs from the [[Bristol Channel]] at [[Uphill Cliff]] affording views over the Somerset Levels. It crosses the central Mendip plateau leading down to [[Cheddar Gorge]] and then to [[Wells]] and [[Frome]].
* [[Monarch's Way]] &mdash; 990&nbsp;km (615&nbsp;miles) long.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.monarchsway.50megs.com/
|publisher=The Monarch's Way Association |title=The Monarch's Way |date=February 2, 2006 }}</ref>  From [[Worcester]] to [[Shoreham-by-Sea]] in [[East Sussex]]. It closely follows the route taken by [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] after his defeat at the [[Battle of Worcester]] in 1651. The route enters Somerset near [[Chewton Mendip]] and crosses the Mendip Hills heading for [[Wells]].

== Mendips in the arts ==

[[Thomas Hardy]] described the Mendips as "a range of limestone rocks stretching from the shores of the Bristol Channel into the middle of Somersetshire",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.phil.muni.cz/~jirka/children/children1/knihy/poley.htm |title=Our exploits at West poley |accessdate=2007-02-17 }}</ref> 
and several of his books refer to the Mendips or sites on the hills.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/hardy/pva238.html |title=A Trampwoman's Tragedy |accessdate=2007-02-17 |publisher=The Victorian Web }}</ref> 
[[Augustus Montague Toplady]] was inspired to write the words of the hymn "[[Rock of Ages (Christian hymn)|Rock of Ages]]" while sheltering under a rock in [[Burrington Combe]] during a [[thunderstorm]] in 1763.

In his 1995 novel ''[[Our Game]]'', [[John le Carr<U+00E9>]] uses [[Priddy Pools]] as the site for the drowning of one of his characters.<ref>{{cite web | title=Priddy Pools in John Le Carre ''Our Game'' | work=Amazon | url=http://www.amazon.com/Our-Game-John-Carre/dp/0340766530/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/002-5496975-9095265?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1175082097&sr=1-1| accessdate=2007-03-28}}</ref>
The Mendips have been used as the location for various film and television filming including the use of [[Cloford Quarry]] as the main location used for the planet Lakertya in the [[Doctor Who]] story ''[[Time and the Rani]]''. The 2007 film ''[[Hot Fuzz]]'' was largely filmed in [[Wells]] and the surrounding area.
