The '''2008 Spanish Grand Prix''' (formally the '''L Gran Premio de Espa<U+00F1>a Telef<U+00F3>nica''') was a [[Formula One]] motor race held on April 27, 2008 at the [[Circuit de Catalunya]], [[Spain]]. It was the fourth race of the [[2008 Formula One season]]. The race, contested over 66&nbsp;laps, was won by [[Kimi R<U+00E4>ikk<U+00F6>nen]] for the [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] team after starting from [[pole position]]. [[Felipe Massa]] finished second in the other Ferrari, and [[Lewis Hamilton]] was third in a [[McLaren]].

R<U+00E4>ikk<U+00F6>nen began the race from pole position alongside [[Renault F1|Renault]] driver [[Fernando Alonso]]. Massa began from third, alongside [[BMW Sauber]] driver [[Robert Kubica]]. Hamilton, the eventual [[List of Formula One World Drivers' Champions|Drivers' Champion]], began from fifth and passed Kubica into the first corner, as Massa passed Alonso. R<U+00E4>ikk<U+00F6>nen maintained his lead through most of the race, leading to Ferrari's one-two finish. The [[safety car]] was deployed several times throughout the race, including for a serious crash involving McLaren driver [[Heikki Kovalainen]], though the Finn escaped with only minor [[concussion]].

Prior to the race weekend, the event was put on probation by the [[F<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ration Internationale de l'Automobile]], the sport's [[Sport governing body|governing body]], for racist taunting during pre-season testing at the cicuit. Subsequently, no such racism was reported during the race weekend. The event was [[Super Aguri F1|Super Aguri's]] final Grand Prix, withdrawing afterwards due to financial pressures, leaving the sport with ten teams. The result promoted Ferrari to the lead in the [[List of Formula One World Constructors' Champions|Constructors' Championship]], 12&nbsp;[[List of Formula One World Championship pointscoring systems|points]] ahead of BMW Sauber and 13&nbsp;points ahead of McLaren. R<U+00E4>ikk<U+00F6>nen extended his lead in the Drivers' Championship to 29&nbsp;points, nine points ahead of Hamilton and ten points ahead of Kubica. Massa moved into fourth place on 18&nbsp;points, with 14&nbsp;races remaining in the season.

{{quote|The real Ferrari is not the one we've seen at the Australian GP. The team reacted immediately and has shown the great potential of our package, which is extremely competitive.

After a poor race in Bahrain, where he narrowly avoided [[Stall (engine)|stalling]] on the [[List of motorsport terminology#G|grid]] before colliding with Renault's [[Fernando Alonso]] a lap later, Hamilton said he would return stronger in Spain: "I approach it in the same way and obviously I won't be making the same mistake again.

The event also took place under the shadow of incidents that had taken place at the same circuit during pre-season testing. At one of the test sessions, Hamilton was subjected to racist taunting by some of the spectators.<ref name=autocourse2008-pg125>{{cite book|author=Alan Henry|title=Autocourse 2008&ndash;09|origyear = 2008|origmonth = December|publisher = CMG Publishing|isbn = 1-9053-3431-1|page = 125}}</ref> In response, the [[F<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ration Internationale de l'Automobile]] (FIA) launched a "Racing Against Racism" programme, and placed the Spanish and [[2008 European Grand Prix|European]] Grands Prix on probation, the latter event being held in the Spanish city of [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]].<ref name=autocourse2008-pg125/> During the course of the event itself, no such incidents were reported.  Hamilton was particularly unpopular with the country's Formula One fans due to his acrimonious inter-team rivalry with Spaniard Alonso during the [[2007 Formula One season|previous year's championship]], which had resulted in the latter leaving the McLaren team and returning to Renault for 2008.<ref name=autocourse2008-pg125/>

The Super Aguri team had been in financial trouble since a proposed takeover deal backed by equity firm [[Dubai International Capital]], under the "Magma Group" banner, failed to take effect.<ref name="superaguri">{{cite web

The qualifying session on Saturday afternoon was split into three&nbsp;parts. The first part ran for 20&nbsp;minutes, and cars that finished the session 17th or lower were eliminated from qualifying. The second part of qualifying lasted 15&nbsp;minutes and eliminated cars that finished in positions&nbsp;11 to 16. The final part of qualifying determined the positions from first to tenth, and decided pole position. Cars which failed to make the final session could refuel before the race, so ran lighter in those sessions. Cars which competed in the final session of qualifying were not allowed to refuel before the race, and as such carried more fuel than in the previous sessions.<ref name="sporting"/>

{{quote box|quote=If we had wanted we could have gone a bit faster but there is no point to push it when you don't need to. I think it was closer than we expected but saying that there were many safety cars, so without them maybe it would have been looking a little bit different. It was a good day &ndash; everything was brilliant. I am happy that Heikki [Kovalainen] seems to be okay after his accident. I cannot ask anything more as the guys did perfect work.

The top three finishers appeared on the [[Podium#Usage in Motorsport|podium]] and in the subsequent [[press conference]], where R<U+00E4>ikk<U+00F6>nen said his pole position start was an important factor in his victory: "This circuit is very difficult to overtake. The start is the best place and when you have a lot of things going with the safety car you might be lucky or very unlucky, so the best place to try to win is always from the front. It was good yesterday and it really helped us today."<ref name="pressconference"/>

Massa said that the result was a good one for his team, as they moved ahead of BMW Sauber in the Constructors' Championship: "We did our homework and brought two Ferrari's in the front &ndash; first and second &ndash; which is very important for the Championship."<ref name="pressconference"/> Although Ferrari had performed well, Massa said their speed was not significantly better than their opponents, so "we need to keep working like crazy in the factory to improve the car in every area."<ref name="pressconference"/>

Hamilton agreed that the start was the most important part of the race: "Obviously when we qualified fifth we knew that it would be very difficult to beat the Ferraris. But the key was to get a good start and make as many places as possible and fortunately I was able to do that."<ref name="pressconference"/> Apart from the start of the race, only two passing manoeuvres were recorded: Heidfeld's lap&nbsp;55 pass on Fisichella and Coulthard's lap&nbsp;61 pass on Sato.<ref name=autocourse2008-pg128>{{cite book|author=Simon Arron|editor=Alan Henry|title=Autocourse 2008&ndash;09|origyear = 2008|origmonth = December|publisher = CMG Publishing|isbn = 1-9053-3431-1|page = 128}}</ref>

Despite his accident, Kovalainen suffered no physical injuries, except for minor [[concussion]].<ref name="kov1"/> After spending the night under observation in a nearby hospital, the McLaren driver was cleared to race in the next Grand Prix, two weeks later.<ref name="kov1"/> McLaren said that the wheel failure was due to a faulty wheel clamp which made it vulnerable to the rapid changes in load and pressure that a [[Formula One car]] endures, eventually leading to the deflated tyre and Kovalainen's accident.<ref name="kov2">{{cite web

{{quote|It was a serious accident and I managed to walk away. I was a bit lucky, but the safety standards the FIA has been pushing worked very well, ... The chassis, the impact, all the barriers took the impact well, the FIA medical team plus the marshals and the team took the job very well and did a fantastic job to get me out of there quickly in a short period of time ... I was able to make a recovery without any injuries. I think it is something that we must still keep working on, but the work paid off that day.<ref name="kov3">{{cite web

However, Mark Webber, a director of the [[Grand Prix Drivers' Association]], said that standards at the track should have been better. Speaking in his regular [[BBC Online]] column, Webber said the "run-off on that corner is too tight and we need to have a look at it because any driver that has an error there is going to have a big crash. If Heikki's accident had happened two seconds later he would have been fine and controlled the car, but it probably happened on the worst section of that whole track."<ref name="webberbbc">{{cite web
