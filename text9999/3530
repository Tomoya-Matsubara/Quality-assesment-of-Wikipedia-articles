'''State Route 220''' ('''SR&nbsp;220''') was a {{convert|27.42|mi|km|adj=on}} long [[state highway]] located entirely in the [[Yakama Indian Reservation]], [[Yakima County, Washington|Yakima County]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], United States. The highway linked [[Fort Simcoe State Park]] in the west to [[White Swan, Washington|White Swan]] and [[Toppenish, Washington|Toppenish]] in the east. The highway had been built sometime between 1915 and 1937, and was renumbered from Secondary State Highway 3B during the [[1964 state highway renumbering (Washington)|1964 state highway renumbering]]. The route was slated to be removed from the state highway system during the 1991 legislative session, and was removed April 1, 1992.

== Route description ==
SR&nbsp;220 started at Fort Simcoe State Park, headed easterly along Fort Simcoe Road until it intersected Hawk Road. At the [[t intersection]] with Hawk Road, the highway turned north and follows Hawk Road until an intersection with White Swan Road. The highway turned back east along White Swan Road, passing through downtown White Swan, before turning south along Curtis Street. The highway passed over a [[BNSF Railway]] rail line, formerly part of the [[Toppenish, Simcoe & Western Railroad]], before Curtis street turned easterly and became Fort Road.<ref name="yak 21 map">{{cite map|publisher=[[Yakima County, Washington|Yakima County]]|title=Yakima County|url=http://kaga.wsulibs.wsu.edu/u?/maps,302|accessdate=26 October 2010|year=1921}}</ref> Fort Road continued almost perfectly east for about {{convert|18|mi|km|abbr=on}} before intersecting [[U.S. Route 97 in Washington|US Route 97]] (US&nbsp;97). After crossing US&nbsp;97, the highway continued as a city street through west [[Toppenish, Washington|Toppenish]] before terminating at [[Washington State Route 22|SR&nbsp;22]]. <ref name="gmaps">{{google maps|url=http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&source=s_d&saddr=Fort+Simcoe+Rd&daddr=46.381456,-120.7754688+to:W+1st+Ave&hl=en&geocode=FTApwwIdYELM-A%3BFZC5wwId1BzN-CmdF8KfnXWXVDGr-_ETJEGKjA%3BFZSgwwIdUBDU-A&mra=dme&mrcr=0&mrsp=2&sz=16&via=1&sll=46.374515,-120.316858&sspn=0.004412,0.013797&ie=UTF8&ll=46.374412,-120.579071&spn=0.141176,0.703125&z=11|title=Former SR 220|accessdate=26 October 2010}}</ref>

Every year the [[Washington State Department of Transportation]] (WSDOT) conducts a series of surveys on its highways in the state to measure traffic volume. This is expressed in terms of [[average annual daily traffic]] (AADT), which is a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. In 1991, WSDOT calculated that as few as 340&nbsp;cars used the highway at the western terminus and as many as 9,300&nbsp;cars at the interchange with SR&nbsp;22.<ref name="aadt91">{{cite web|url=http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/mapsdata/tdo/PDF_and_ZIP_Files/Annual_Traffic_Report_1991.pdf|title=1991 Annual Traffic Report|publisher=WSDOT|page=118|accessdate=26 October 2010|format=PDF}}</ref>
