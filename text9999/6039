'''Lichfield''' ({{Pron-en|<U+02C8>l<U+026A>t<U+0283>fi<U+02D0>ld}}) is a [[city status in the United Kingdom|city]] and [[civil parish]]<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.ons.gov.uk/about-statistics/geography/products/geog-products-area/names-codes/administrative/index.html|title = Names and codes for Administrative Geography|date = 31 December 2008|publisher = Office for National Statistics|accessdate = 15 September 2009}}</ref> in [[Staffordshire]], England. One of seven civil parishes with city status in England, Lichfield is situated roughly 25&nbsp;km (16 miles) north of [[Birmingham]] and 200&nbsp;km (124 miles) northwest of [[London]].

Lichfield is notable for its three-spired [[Lichfield Cathedral|cathedral]] and as the birthplace of [[Samuel Johnson]], the writer of the first authoritative ''[[A Dictionary of the English Language|Dictionary of the English Language]]''. Today it still retains its old importance as an ecclesiastical centre, but its industrial and commercial development has been relatively small; the centre of the city thus retains an essentially old-world character. The construction of a major shopping and leisure complex, which will transform the city centre, was due to begin in 2009, however, due to the global economic downturn, the construction has been delayed.<ref name="icLichfield">{{cite web |url=http://iclichfield.icnetwork.co.uk/news/localnews//tm_headline=credit-squeeze-delays-friarsgate&method=full&objectid=22250839&siteid=108911-name_page.html|title=New Friarsgate development gets delayed due to 'credit crunch' |publisher= icLichfield |accessdate=20 November 2008}}</ref> In July 2009, the [[Staffordshire Hoard]], the largest hoard of [[Anglo-Saxon]] gold ever found in Britain was discovered in a field near Lichfield.

The population of the city according to the 2001 census is 27,900 and the wider [[Lichfield (district)|Lichfield]] district has a population of 93,237. In mid-2007, the city had an estimated population of 30,050 (from the estimated headcounts<ref>Mid-2007 Quinary Estimates for 2009 wards (experimental) at {{cite web

== Etymology ==
Legend has it that a thousand Christians were martyred in Lichfield around AD 300, during the reign of the Roman Emperor [[Diocletian]], and that the name 'Lichfield' actually means 'field of the dead'. There is however, no evidence to support this legend.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=42340|title=Explaining the origin of the 'field of the dead' legend |publisher= British History Online |accessdate=20 November 2008}}</ref> At ''Wall'', {{convert|3|mi|0}} to the south of the present city, there was a [[Romano-British]] village called ''[[Letocetum]]'' from the [[British language (Celtic)|British (Celtic)]] for "grey wood", from which the first half of the name Lichfield is derived.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/~cczappdv/epnnewmap/detailpop.php?placeno=9823 |title=English Place Name Society Database at Nottingham University |publisher=Nottingham.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-07-17}}</ref> The second part of the name is derived from the Old English "feld", meaning 'open country'. In that sense 'Lichfield' would be 'common pasture in grey wood', 'grey' perhaps referring to varieties of tree prominent in the landscape, such as ash and elm.<ref>[From: 'Lichfield: The place and street names, population and boundaries ', A History of the County of Stafford: Volume 14: Lichfield (1990), pp. 37-42.

=== Early history: Religious centre of Mercian kings ===
The early history of Lichfield is obscure. The first authentic record of Lichfield occurs in [[Bede]]'s history, where it is called ''Licidfelth'' and mentioned as the place where [[Ceadda|St Chad]] fixed the episcopal see of the Mercians in 669. The first [[Christian]] king of Mercia, [[Wulfhere of Mercia|King Wulfhere]] donated land at Lichfield for Chad to build a monastery. It was because of this that the ecclesiastical centre of the [[Diocese of Mercia]] became settled at Lichfield, which was approximately 3 miles north of the seat of the Mercian kings at [[Tamworth]]. The first cathedral to be built on the present site was in 700 when [[Bishop Hedda]] built a new church to house the bones of St Chad which had become a sacred shrine to many pilgrims when he died in 672. The burial in the cathedral of the kings of Mercia, [[Wulfhere of Mercia|King Wulfhere]] in 674 and [[Ceolred of Mercia|King Ceolred]] in 716, further increased the prestige of Lichfield.<ref name="british-history.ac.uk">From: 'Lichfield: History to c.1500', A History of the County of Stafford: Volume 14: Lichfield (1990), pp. 4-14. URL: http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=42336  Date accessed: 24 July 2009.</ref>  In 786 [[Offa of Mercia|Offa]], King of Mercia, raised Lichfield to the dignity of an [[Higbert, Archbishop of Lichfield|archbishopric]], with authority over all the bishops from the Humber to the Thames. However after King Offa's death in 796, Lichfield's power waned and in 803 the primacy was restored to Canterbury by [[Pope Leo III]] after only 16 years. The [[Historia Britonum]] lists the city as one of the 28 cities of Britain around AD 833.

=== 9th century: Viking invaders and decline ===
During the 9th century, the [[Kingdom of Mercia]] was devastated by the [[Vikings]] from Denmark. Lichfield itself was unwalled and the cathedral was despoiled, so [[Peter of Lichfield|Bishop Peter]] moved the see to the fortified and wealthier [[Chester]] in 1075. His successor, [[Robert de Limesey]], transferred it to Coventry, but it was eventually restored to Lichfield in 1148. Work began on the present Gothic cathedral in 1195. At the time of the [[Domesday survey]], Lichfield was held by the [[bishop of Chester]], where the see of the bishopric had been moved 10 years earlier; Lichfield was listed as a small village. The lord of the manor was the bishop of Chester until the reign of [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]].

=== Middle Ages: New town laid out by Bishop Clinton ===
[[Roger de Clinton|Bishop Clinton]] was responsible for transforming the scattered settlements to the south of Minster Pool into the ladder plan streets we recognise today. Market Street, Wade Street, Bore Street and Frog Lane linked Dam Street, Conduit Street and Bakers Lane on one side with Bird Street and St John Street on the other. Bishop Clinton also fortified the cathedral close, enclosed the town with a bank and ditch, and gates were set up where roads into the town crossed the ditch.<ref name="british-history.ac.uk"/> In 1291 Lichfield was severely damaged by a fire, which destroyed most of the town, however the Cathedral and Close survived unscathed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.localhistories.org/lichfield.html|title=Brief History of Lichfield |publisher= Local Histories|accessdate=20 November 2008}}</ref>
In 1387 [[Richard II of England|Richard II]] gave a charter for the foundation of the gild of St Mary and St John the Baptist; this gild functioned as the local government, until its dissolution by [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]], who incorporated the town in 1548.

=== 16th century: Reformation and martyrs ===
[[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] had a dramatic affect on Lichfield. The [[English Reformation|Reformation]] brought the disappearance of pilgrim traffic following the destruction of [[St Chad]]'s shrine in 1538 which was a major loss to the city's economic prosperity. That year too the Franciscan friary was dissolved, the site becoming a private estate. Further economic decline followed the outbreak of [[Black Death|plague]] in 1593, which resulted in the death of over a third of the entire population.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=42337|title='Lichfield: From the Reformation to c.1800', A History of the County of Stafford: Volume 14: Lichfield (1990), pp. 14-24. |publisher= British History Online |accessdate=22 November 2008}}</ref>

Three people were burned at the stake for heresy under Mary I. The last person in England to be burnt at the stake for [[heresy]] was in Lichfield. [[Edward Wightman]] from [[Burton upon Trent]] was [[Execution by burning|burnt at the stake]] in the Market Place on 11 April 1612 for refusing to recant his [[Baptist]] beliefs.

=== 17th century: Destruction of the Civil War ===
In the [[English Civil War]], Lichfield was divided. The cathedral authorities, with a certain following, were for the king, but the townsfolk generally sided with the Parliament. This led to the fortification of the close in 1643. Lichfield's position as a focus of supply routes had an important strategic significance during the war, and both forces were anxious for control of the city. [[Robert Greville, 2nd Baron Brooke|Lord Brooke]], notorious for his hostility to the church, led an assault against it, but was killed by a deflected bullet on St Chad's day, an accident welcomed as a miracle by the Royalists. The close yielded and was retaken by [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine]] in this year; but on the breakdown of the king's cause in 1646 it again surrendered. The cathedral suffered extensive damage from the war, including the complete destruction of the central spire. It was subsequently restored at the end of the [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]] period under the supervision of [[John Hacket|Bishop Hacket]], and thanks in part to the generosity of [[King Charles II of England|King Charles II]].

=== 18th century: Thriving coaching city and cultural centre ===
Lichfield started to develop a lively coaching trade as a stop-off on the busy route between London and [[Chester]] from the 1650s onwards, making it Staffordshire's most prosperous town. By the start of the 18th century the city thrived as a busy coaching city on the main route to the northwest and Ireland. It also became a centre of great intellectual activity being the home of many famous people including [[Samuel Johnson]], [[David Garrick]], [[Erasmus Darwin]] and [[Anna Seward]], this prompted Johnson's remark that Lichfield was "a city of philosophers". In the 1720s [[Daniel Defoe]] described Lichfield as 'a fine, neat, well-built, and indifferent large city', the principal town in the region after Chester.<ref name="From 1990 pp. 14-24">From: 'Lichfield: From the Reformation to c.1800', A History of the County of Stafford: Volume 14: Lichfield (1990), pp. 14-24. URL: http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=42337  Date accessed: 24 July 2009.</ref> An infantry regiment of the [[British Army]] was formed at Lichfield in 1705 by Col. [[Luke Lillingstone]] in the King's Head pub in Bird Street. In 1751 it became the 38th regiment of foot and in 1783 the 1st [[Staffordshire Regiment]]; after reorganization in 1881 it became the 1st battalion of the South Staffordshire Regiment.<ref name="From 1990 pp. 14-24"/>

=== 19th century: Industrial Revolution and decline ===
The arrival of the [[Industrial Revolution]] and the railways in the 19th century signaled the end of Lichfield's position as an important staging post for coaching traffic. Whilst the industrial development at nearby Birmingham exploded, along with its population, Lichfield remained largely unchanged in character.

=== 20th century: World War II and post-War expansion ===
The first council houses were built in the Dimbles area of the city in the 1930s. The outbreak of World War II brought over 2000 [[Evacuations of civilians in Britain during World War II|evacuees]] from industrialised areas. However due to the lack of heavy industry in the city, Lichfield escaped lightly, although there were [[strategic bombing|air raids]] in 1940 and 1941 and 3 Lichfeldians were killed. Just outside the city [[Wellington Bomber]]s flew out of Fradley Aerodrome which was known as [[RAF Lichfield]]. After the war the council built many new houses in the 1960s including some high-rise flats, The late 70s and early 80s brought a large housing estate at Boley Park in the east of the city. The city's population tripled between 1951 and the late 1980s. Today the city continues to expand; to the west, a new area of housing has been under development for a number of years which has swelled the city's population by some 3,000.

=== 21st century ===
Plans have been approved for a major new <U+00A3>100 million shopping and leisure complex, at [[Friarsgate]], opposite [[Lichfield City Station]]. Friarsgate garage, Lichfield's multi-storey car park, police station, bus station and public toilets will all be demolished to make way for 22,000 square metres of retail space and 2,000 square metres designated for leisure facilities. It has been announced that this will consist of a flagship Debenhams department store, a six-screen cinema, a hotel, 37 individual shops and 56 apartments.<ref name="icLichfield"/> However, due to the global economic downturn, the construction has been delayed. In July 2009, The [[Staffordshire Hoard]] the largest collection of [[Anglo-Saxon]] gold ever found was discovered in a field near Lichfield.

== Governance ==
=== Local government ===

Historically the [[Bishop of Lichfield]] had authority over the city. It wasn't until 1548 with Edward VI's charter that Lichfield had anything like a secular government. As a reward for the support given to Mary I by the bailiffs and citizens during the duke of Northumberland's attempt to prevent her accession, the queen issued a new charter in 1553, confirming the 1548 charter and in addition granting the city its own sheriff. The same charter made Lichfield a county separate from the rest of [[Staffordshire]]. It remained so until 1888.

Today, the City Council has 28 members who are elected every four years. The Mayor is the civic head of the Council and chairs Council meetings. The Deputy Mayor undertakes the Mayor's duties in the absence of the Mayor. The Council also appoints a Leader of Council to be the main person responsible for leadership of the Council's political and policy matters. The Council is also one of only 15 towns and cities in England and Wales which appoints a Sheriff.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lichfield.gov.uk/cc.ihtml |title=Lichfield City Council Functions |publisher=Lichfield.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-07-17}}</ref>

=== Members of Parliament ===

The [[Lichfield (UK Parliament constituency)|Lichfield constituency]] sent two members to the parliament of 1304 and to a few succeeding parliaments, but the representation did not become regular until 1552; in 1867 it lost one member, and in 1885 its representation was merged in that of the county.<ref name="From 1990 pp. 14-24"/>

The current Member of Parliament for Lichfield is the Conservative [[Michael Fabricant]], who has been MP for Lichfield since 1997. Fabricant was first elected at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1992|1992 general election]] for [[Mid Staffordshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Mid Staffordshire]], regaining the seat for the Conservatives following [[Sylvia Heal|Sylvia Heal's]] victory at the [[Mid Staffordshire by-election, 1990|1990 by-election]]. He took the seat with a majority of 6,236 and has remained a Member of Parliament since. The Mid Staffordshire seat was abolished at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997 general election]], but Fabricant contested and won the Lichfield constituency, which partially replaced it, by just 238 votes. He has remained the Lichfield MP since, increasing his majority to 4,426 in [[United Kingdom general election, 2001|the 2001 general election]] and to 7,080 in [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005]].

== Economy ==
[[File:tudorcafe.jpg|thumb|The Tudor Caf<U+00E9> in Bore Street was built in 1510]]
Lichfield's wealth grew along with its importance as an ecclesiastical centre. The original settlement prospered as the place where pilgrims gathered to worship at the shrine of [[St Chad]], this practice continued up until the [[English Reformation|Reformation]] when the shrine was destroyed.

In the Middle Ages, the main industry in Lichfield was making woollen cloth. There was also a leather industry in Lichfield. Much of the surrounding area was open pasture and there were many surrounding farms.

In the 18th century, Lichfield became a busy coaching centre, there was little industry, the main source of wealth to the city coming from the money generated by its many visitors. The invention of the railways saw the decline in coach travel and with it came the decline in Lichfield's prosperity.

By the end of the 19th century, [[brewing]] was the principal industry, and in the neighbourhood were large market gardens which provided food for the growing populations of nearby [[Birmingham]] and the [[Black Country]].

Today there are a number of light industrial areas predominantly in the east of the city, not dominated by any one particular industry. The district is famous for two local products: [[Armitage Shanks]], manufacturers of baths/bidets and showers, and [[Arthur Price|Arthur Price of England]], master cutlers and silversmiths.  Many residents commute to Birmingham.

It is predicted{{Who|date=September 2009}} that once completed, the new Friarsgate retail and leisure development could attract 11,000 more visitors to the city every month, generating annual sales of around <U+00A3>61 million and creating hundreds of jobs in the city.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://iclichfield.icnetwork.co.uk/news/localnews//tm_headline=credit-squeeze-delays-friarsgate&method=full&objectid=22250839&siteid=108911-name_page.html|title=Economic benefits of new development to Lichfield |publisher= icLichfield |accessdate=20 November 2008}}</ref>

== Demographics ==

At the time of the 2001 census, the population of the City of Lichfield was 27,900. Lichfield is 98.1% white and 79% Christian. 56.7% of the population over 16 were married. 63.2% was employed and 16% of the people were retired. All of these figures were higher than the national average.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lichfield.gov.uk/cc-statistics.ihtml |title=Statistics |publisher=Lichfield |date= |accessdate=2010-07-17}}</ref>

== Culture ==
[[File:LichfieldGarrickCorner.JPG|thumb|[[Lichfield Garrick Theatre]] was built in 2003]]
The [[Lichfield Garrick Theatre|Garrick Theatre]] was opened in 2003 replacing the Civic Hall, which was built in the 1970s. Each year in July [[The Lichfield Festival]] takes place, based primarily around the cathedral and the Garrick Theatre, it is celebration of classical music, dance, drama, film, jazz literature, poetry, visual arts and world music.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lichfieldfestival.org/2008/content/view/25/40/|title=About The Lichfield Festival|publisher= Lichfield Festival |accessdate=1 January 2009}}</ref> Since 1995 the Festival has incorporated a Medieval Market, taking place in the Cathedral Close.

Once every three years, The Lichfield [[Mystery Play]] [[play cycle|cycle]] is performed in the Cathedral, the Market Place and on Stowe Fields. It is a cycle of 26 medieval plays involving nearly 1000 people, making it one of the largest community arts events in Europe.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lichfieldmysteries.co.uk/|title=About The Lichfield Mysteries|publisher= |accessdate=1 January 2009}}</ref>

In 2009 the first [[Inspire Film Festival]] took place at the Garrick theater, created by a group of local media students. The event featured short films and documentaries from students all over the country.

The [[Lichfield bower|Lichfield Bower]] takes place on Spring Bank Holiday Monday, it dates back to the Middle Ages, when the townsfolk, after fulfilling their duty of attendance at the Court of Arraye, were given the rest of the day as holiday. A procession of marching bands and carnival floats makes its way through the city, where the Bower Queen is crowned outside the Guildhall at noon. There is also a fun fair in the city centre, and a fair and jamboree in [[Beacon Park]].

The Lichfield Real Ale, Jazz & Blues Festival takes place in June each year.

The [[Bloodstock Open Air]] heavy metal music festival takes place every year at [[Catton Hall]], approximately 7 miles outside of Lichfield.

== Sport ==
Historically [[Rugby Union|rugby]] was more popular in the city than [[soccer|football]], this was largely due to the fact that it was the main sport at [[King Edward VI School (Lichfield)|Lichfield Grammar School]]. However, both sports have remained at amateur level. [[Lichfield Rugby Union Football Club]] was founded in 1874. As of 2008-09 season they play in the [[Midlands 3 West (North)]] League.
