The '''legal status of Germany''' concerns the issue of the downfall or continuation of the [[Germany|German]] [[nation state]], i.e., the [[German Reich]] of the 1871 [[Unification of Germany|unification]], after the military [[Allied-occupied Germany|occupation]] of [[Nazi Germany]] by the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] forces in 1945. It became current once again when the [[East Germany|German Democratic Republic]] (East Germany) [[German reunification|joined]] the [[West Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]] (West Germany) in 1990.

==Overview==
After [[World War II]], determination of legal status was relevant, for instance, to resolve the issue of whether the West German Federal Republic would be the [[succession of states|successor state]] of the German Reich<U+2014>with all at the time uncodified implications of state succession, such as the continuation of [[treaty|treaties]]<U+2014>or if, according to [[international law]], it would be identical with the German Reich. Further, determination of authority, for instance to assert or deny territorial claims, esp. with respect to the [[Former eastern territories of Germany|former eastern territories]], was dependent upon this determination of legal status.

The issue was also significant from a constitutional legal perspective: while in the case of the downfall of the German Reich, the Federal Republic would need to have [[Constitution|reconstituted]] itself, merely a [[Organization|re-organization]] after overcoming the Nazi rule would have been necessary otherwise. Dependent upon this, consequently, was also the question of whether for the creation of the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany]] ''(Grundgesetz)'' merely the consent of each and every<U+2014>in this regard again [[Sovereignty|sovereign]]<U+2014>[[States of Germany|federal state]] ''(Bundesland)'' was required, or if [[constituent assembly|constituent power]] ''(pouvoir constituant)'' lay with the entirety of the [[Germans|German People]] as it was spread across the German states.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

The issue of the legal status of Germany from an international legal perspective prompted questions, as the Allied takeover was neither determined by the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|Hague Conventions]] nor could it be measured against the three-element theory of state law developed by the legal academic [[Georg Jellinek]] (1851<U+2013>1911), whereafter a state qualifies as a subject of international law if it fulfills the three characteristics of territory, [[people]], and [[government]].{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

==Surrender of the Wehrmacht==
[[File:Kapitulation-reims.gif|thumb|270px|Colonel General [[Alfred Jodl]] signing the instrument of surrender at Reims, 7 May 1945]]
After the ''[[Machtergreifung]]'' of the [[Nazi Party]] in 1933, state power had been personified more and more within Reich [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] ''(Reichskanzler)'' [[Adolf Hitler]], who upon the death of [[President of Germany (1919<U+2013>1945)|Reich President]] [[Paul von Hindenburg]] on 2 August 1934 simultaneously served as [[head of government]] and [[head of state]] (styled ''[[F<U+00FC>hrer]] and Reichskanzler'').<ref name="GSdDR">[http://www.documentarchiv.de/ns/stobrhpt.html Gesetz <U+00FC>ber das Staatsoberhaupt des Deutschen Reichs vom 1. August 1934].</ref> Following his suicide on April 30, 1945, even the successor regime appointed in his [[Last will and testament of Adolf Hitler|political testament]] resigned during the cabinet's May 2 session. Grand admiral [[Karl D<U+00F6>nitz]], appointed Reich President in Hitler's testament, gave the task of forming an acting government to Leading Minister [[Lutz Graf Schwerin von Krosigk]], however, his so-called [[Flensburg Government]] no longer possessed any ''[[de facto]]'' governmental authority.  

These incidents preceded the [[German Instrument of Surrender|unconditional surrender]] of the German ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' armed forces, signed by representatives of the ''[[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht|Oberkommando]]'' High Command on May 7 in [[Reims]] and on May 8 in [[Karlshorst|Berlin-Karlshorst]] (often incorrectly referred to as "Germany's surrender"), from which, due to its nature as a purely military capitulation, no legal consequences for the legal status of the German Reich arose.<ref name="VerfGesch">Frotscher/Pieroth: ''Verfassungsgeschichte'', Rn 641.</ref>

On May 23, the Allies dissolved the Flensburg government and arrested its members.  This created a legal vacuum that was only resolved on June 5, when the commanders-in-chief of the Allied forces announced, by way of the [[Berlin Declaration (1945)|Berlin Declaration]], the assumption of "supreme authority" in Germany, since the Allied forces not only took control of government, but of the state as a whole. However, an [[annexation]], explicitly, did not take place:

<blockquote>
"There is no central Government or authority in Germany capable of accepting responsibility for the maintenance of order, the administration of the country and compliance with the requirements of the victorious Powers. "
</blockquote>
:[...]
<blockquote>
"The Governments of the United States of America, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United Kingdom, and the Provisional Government of the French Republic, hereby assume supreme authority with respect to Germany, including all the powers possessed by the German Government, the High Command and any state, municipal, or local government or authority. The assumption, for the purposes stated above, of the said authority and powers does not effect the annexation of Germany."<ref>[http://www.jstor.org/sici?sici=0002-9300(194507)39%3A3%3C171%3AUSBUDR%3E2.0.CO%3B2-G The American Journal of International Law, Vol. 39, No. 3 (Jul., 1945), pp. 171-178] JSTOR</ref>
</blockquote>
[[File:Germany occupation zones with border.jpg|thumb|270px|Occupied Germany within 1937 borders]]
State authority was from then on carried out by the [[Allied Control Council]] until its de facto dissolution in 1948. International [[legitimation]] hereto resulted from Allied occupational supremacy. The eastern territories of the German Reich in its boundaries of December 31, 1937, were assigned to [[People's Republic of Poland|Polish]] and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] administration; the remaining area was divided into four occupational zones and the joint occupational zone of the capital [[Berlin]] was submitted to the administration of an Allied Command ''([[:de:Alliierte Kommandantur|Alliierte Kommandantur]])'', which in turn was subordinate to the Allied Control Council.

<blockquote>
"For occupational purposes, Germany will be divided into three zones, within her borders of December 31st 1937, to each of which one of the three powers will be assigned, as well as a special zone for Berlin, which is governed by the joint occupation of the three powers"
([[London Protocol]] of December 12th, 1944; extension to France did not take place until the [[Yalta Conference]] in February 1945.)
</blockquote>

Meanwhile, grassroots reconstruction of German [[public administration]] commenced. While [[Municipalities of Germany|municipal]] adminstrations ''([[Gemeinde]]n)'' had continued operating nearly without any interruption, and by 1946 local elections took place in all occupational zones, Germany's federal states located within the occupational zones of the [[Allies|western allies]] were once again assigned state governments between May 1945 and July 1947. In addition, state assemblies bearing constitutional authority were elected and from 1946 onward, state constitutions became effective, in most cases following [[referendum]]s.<ref name="StaatsR4">Schweitzer: ''Staatsrecht III'', 8. Aufl., Rn 616; Frotscher/Pieroth: ''Verfassungsgeschichte'', Rn 689 ff.</ref>

==West and East Germany==
After the Allied [[state-building]] attempts to implement an all-German administration had foundered on factionalism, the Western Allies resolved upon the foundation of a West German [[federation]], established on 23 May 1949 with the promulgation of the Basic Law as it had been adopted by the [[Parlamentarischer Rat|Parliamentary Council]] and approved by the Western occupation forces. The federal republic became capable of acting upon the [[West German federal election, 1949|federal election]] held on August 14, the constitutive meeting of the [[Bundestag]] parliament on September 7, and the accession of the [[Cabinet of Germany|federal cabinet]] on September 20, 1949. In turn the [[Soviet Military Administration in Germany|Soviet Military Administration]] on October 7 implemented the [[People's Chamber]] (''Volkskammer'') parliament in the [[Soviet occupation zone]] and [[East Berlin]], which passed the [[Constitution of East Germany]], officially named "German Democratic Republic" (GDR). The [[Council of Ministers of the GDR]] assumed office on October 12, 1949.

On April 10, 1949, the Western Allies had drawn up the [[occupation statute]] and had it conveyed to the Parliamentary Council. Officially announced on May 12, it reserved a number of sovereign rights, like [[foreign policy]] and external trade, for the Allied authoritites. Any amendment to the West German Constitution was subject to Allied permission, specific laws may be rejected, and the military governors may take over all governmental power in times of crisis. Those reservations were to be executed by the [[Allied High Commission]] established on June 20 as the supreme state power. On November 22, 1949, Chancellor [[Konrad Adenauer]] signed the [[Petersberg Agreement]], according to which the [[sovereignty]] of West Germany remained limited.

==State of war==
Cessation of hostilities between the United States and Germany had been proclaimed on 13 December 1946 by United States President [[Harry S.Truman]].<ref>[http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F2/188/188.F2d.266.12612_1.html Werner v.

In the [[Petersberg Agreement]] of November 22, 1949, it was noted that the West German government wanted an end to the state of war, but the request could not be granted. The U.S. state of war with Germany was being maintained for legal reasons, and though it was softened somewhat it was not suspended since "the U.S. wants to retain a legal basis for keeping a U.S. force in Western Germany".<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,856382,00.html A Step Forward] [[Time Magazine]] Monday, Nov. 28, 1949</ref> At a meeting for the Foreign Ministers of France, the United Kingdom, and the United States in New York from September 12 to December 19, 1950, it was stated that among other measures to strengthen [[West Germany]]'s position in the [[Cold War]] that the western allies would "end by legislation the state of war with Germany".<ref>Staff.
