The play is centered on sociopolitical themes such as [[Islamophobia]] and the self-identity of Muslim-American citizens.<ref name=BTCOD/> It focuses on a dinner party between four people with very different backgrounds.

==Critical commentary==
[[Charles Isherwood]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'', who saw the [[Off-Broadway]] production in 2012, said it was "a continuously engaging, vitally engaged play" that "bristles with wit and intelligence" and "puts contemporary attitudes toward religion under a microscope, revealing how tenuous self-image can be for people born into one way of being who have embraced another."<ref name=BDToIaI/> Isherwood selected the play as one of his year-end Ten Best Plays of 2012.<ref name=HTotY>{{cite web|last=Isherwood|first=Charles|title=Hottest Tickets of the Year|url=http://theater.nytimes.com/2012/12/16/theater/best-plays-from-virginia-woolf-to-british-imports.html|accessdate=2013-05-12|date=2012-12-12|work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref> David Rooney of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' also selected it as among his Ten Best in New York Theater 2012, writing that Akhtar "staked a claim as one of the boldest voices to appear on the playwriting scene in recent years with this stinging swipe at the fallacy of the post-racial nation."<ref>{{cite web|last=Rooney|first=David|title=David Rooney on the Record Year in New York Theater|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/best-new-york-theater-2012-406416|accessdate=2013-05-12|date=2012-12-27|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]}}</ref>

Of the Chicago production at American Theater company, ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' theatre critic Chris Jones praised the show as "intensely arresting."<ref name=TineoirD/> ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]] Chicago''{{'s}} Kris Vire called the play a "a compact, stunning gut punch addressing the cultural affinities some of us are allowed to escape and those we aren't."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timeoutchicago.com/arts-culture/theater/15104803/disgraced-at-american-theater-company-theater-review|title=Disgraced at American Theater Company|accessdate=2012-05-12|date=2012-02-01|work=[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]] Chicago}}</ref> However, ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' critic Hedy Weiss noted that the plays five characters were all "identity-warped", and the show was a "minefield... that feels all too deliberately booby-trapped by the playwright."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.suntimes.com/entertainment/stage/10352842-421/disgraced-maelstrom-is-too-predictable-at-american-theater-company.html|title=American Theater Co.<U+2019>s <U+2018>Disgraced<U+2019> creates a predictable chaos|accessdate=2013-04-25|date=2012-02-02|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|author=Weiss, Hedy}}</ref> The play won the [[Jeff Award]]<U+2014>honoring excellence in Chicago Theater<U+2014>for Best New Play in Chicago 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/171183-Iceman-Cometh-Follies-Hero-Disgraced-Caroline-OConnor-Are-2012-Jeff-Award-Winners|title=Iceman Cometh, Follies, Hero, Disgraced, Caroline O'Connor Are 2012 Jeff Award Winners|author=Jones, Kenneth|accessdate=2013-04-28|date=2012-10-16|work=[[Playbill]]}}</ref>

''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' critic Thom Geier suggested that the ending was underdeveloped, but that the play was well-executed: "Akhtar packs a lot into his scenes, in terms of both coincidence-heavy personal drama and talky disquisitions on religion and politics, but he usually manages to pull back from the edge of too-muchness. There is an admirable restraint to director Kimberly Senior's well-paced scenes. Mandvi, best known for his comedy, has a surprisingly commanding stage presence and captures the full range of his character's internal conflicts."<ref name=D/>

==Themes==
[[National Public Radio]] describes the the play thematically as one that "tackles Islamophobia and questions of Muslim-American identity".<ref name=BTCOD>{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/2013/04/29/179829145/behind-the-curtain-of-disgraced|title=Behind The Curtain Of 'Disgraced'|accessdate=2013-12-06|date=2013-04-29|publisher=[[NPR]]}}</ref> Isherwood noted: "As two couples exchange observations about faith and politics in the modern world, the intellectual thickets they find themselves in become increasingly tangled." More specifically he said, it is a play "about thorny questions of identity and religion in the contemporary world, with an accent on the incendiary topic of how radical Islam and the terrorism it inspires have affected the public discourse."<ref name=BDToIaI>{{cite web|url=http://theater.nytimes.com/2012/10/23/theater/reviews/disgraced-by-ayad-akhtar-with-aasif-mandvi.html|title=Beware Dinner Talk on Identity and Islam: <U+2018>Disgraced,<U+2019> by Ayad Akhtar, With Aasif Mandvi|accessdate=2013-04-28|date=2012-10-22|author=Isherwood, Charles |work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref> Kapoor has "rejected his Muslim upbringing (and even his surname) to better assimilate into his law firm, but he still feels the occasional tug of Islam".<ref name=D/> Geier wrote: "''Disgraced'' offers an engaging snapshot of the challenge for upwardly mobile Islamic Americans in the post-9/11 age."<ref name=D>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20364394_20641491,00.html|title=Disgraced (2012): The Daily Show's Aasif Mandvi is the compelling star of an Off Broadway drama about a lapsed Muslim yuppie in post-9/11 Manhattan|accessdate=2013-04-28|date=2012-10-25|author=Geier, Thom|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]}}</ref> According to ''[[The Guardian]]'' {{'s}} [[Stephen Moss]], the play comes to a head as the protagonist "tries to come to terms with his multiple identity <U+2013> American v Asian, Muslim v secularist, passive observer of injustice v activist".<ref name=PpAA/> Although Amir has an affinity for $600 shirts with obscenely high [[thread count]]s, his home dinner party is set in his apartment which is "spare [sic] and tasteful with subtle flourishes of the Orient".<ref name=AADW2PPFD/>

During interviews following the Pulitzer announcement, Akhtar said that the play's title has both a literal and a metaphorical meaning. Literally, Amir plays out his disgrace in almost real time before the audience. Metaphorically, Akhtar says "There are ways that the colonial history of the West is still playing out in the Muslim world. The events that comprise that history &mdash; a disgrace of native peoples, as it were &mdash; is still very much a part of our contemporary moment."<ref name=QwAAtPPwid>{{cite web|url=http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-04-19/entertainment/38666057_1_american-dervish-ayad-akhtar-muslim|title=Q&A with Ayad Akhtar, the Pulitzer Prize winner in drama|accessdate=2013-09-16|date=2013-04-19|work=[[The Washington Post]]|author=Levingston, Steven}}</ref>
