'''Cosmo4''' is a Swedish [[girl group]] consisting of four members: Yasmine, Ulrika, Jenny, and Rudina. The group has released two successful singles since 2006. Previously, Carin was a member of the group until late 2006, when Carin left to concentrate on her studies and Rudina replaced her.  The girls hail from different parts of the world. Yasmine is from [[China]], Jenny is from [[Kenya]], Rudina is from [[Kosovo]] and Ulrika is from [[Sweden]]; all of the girls live in Sweden.

In 2007, the group participated in the Swedish [[Melodifestivalen]] second semifinal with the song "What's Your Name" to compete for the chance to represent [[Sweden]] in the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] in [[Finland]].
