(stylised as '''GO!''') is an [[Australia]]n [[free-to-air]] [[standard definition]] digital television channel launched by the [[Nine Network]] on 9 August 2009.<ref name="august-launch-1">{{cite web|first=|last=|title=Nine announces new TV channel|url=http://news.ninemsn.com.au/entertainment/837881/nine-announces-new-tv-channel|publisher=[[ninemsn]]|date=15 July 2009|accessdate=24 July 2009}}</ref><ref name="launch schedule">{{cite web|first=David|last=Knox|title=Nine releases GO! schedule|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2009/07/nine-releases-go-schedule.html|publisher=tvtonight.com.au|date=24 July 2009|accessdate=24 July 2009}}</ref>

==History==
===Origins===
[[Image:Go99Logo.svg|thumb|120px|left|Go!'s original concept logo]]
The general concept for Go! was revealed on 23 March 2009, with the [[Nine Network]] announcing their intention to start a [[standard definition]] variety-based multichannel, expected to launch mid-way through 2009. The channel's name and branding was first revealed as Go!99 on 14 April 2009 by TV Tonight, a [[blog]] dedicated to [[Television in Australia|Australian television]].

The channel's name was confirmed by the Nine Network via ''[[A Current Affair]]'' as Go! on 15 July 2009,<ref name="GO! confirmation">{{cite web|first=David|last=Knox|title=Nine confirms GO!99|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2009/07/nine-confirms-go99.html|publisher=tvtonight.com.au|date=15 July 2009|accessdate=15 July 2009}}</ref> as well as multi-coloured logo variations.<ref name="GO! confirmation"/><ref name="august-launch-1"/>

===Launch===
The channel went to air at {{nowrap|1:00 pm}} on 5 August 2009, broadcasting a promo loop. Go! officially began broadcasting scheduled programming from 9 August 2009 at {{nowrap|6:30 pm}} with ''[[Wipeout (2008 game show)|Wipeout]]'' being the first program to air on the channel.<ref>{{cite web|first=David|last=Knox|title=Go Adjusts Launch Time|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2009/07/go-adjusts-launch-time.html|publisher=tvtonight.com.au|date=29 July 2009|accessdate=10 August 2009}}</ref> The Nine Network's regional affiliates, [[WIN Television]] and [[NBN Television]], also launched Go! on 9 August 2009, on Channel 88.

There have been reports that Go!'s technical launch has caused a significant number of digital TV receivers to no longer pick up Nine's digital channels. Nine have established a helpline for viewers experiencing problems or requiring assistance to tune in to the new channel.<ref>{{cite web|first=Asher|last=Moses|title=Nine flicks the Go! switch and everything fades to black|url=http://www.smh.com.au/digital-life/hometech/nine-flicks-the-go-switch-and-everything-fades-to-black-20090807-echr.html|publisher=Sydney Morning Herald|date=7 August 2009|accessdate=10 August 2009}}</ref>

Les Sampson, Nine<U+2019>s Network Director of Multichannels, describes Go! as a "work in progress". He states that in future the channel will expand its current programming blocks, and produce and broadcast interstitials such as fashion updates, snow report updates, and bar and restaurant reviews between programs.<ref name="survivors ready"/>
