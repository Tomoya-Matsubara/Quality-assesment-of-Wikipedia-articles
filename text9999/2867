Oklahoma State scored first, with a surprising 49&nbsp;yard pass from Al Pena to D'Juan Woods. The Cowboys had lined up tight on 4th and 1 as if trying a short, power run, but faked that play and threw a deep pass instead, catching the Longhorn defense off-guard. Texas replied with a touchdown pass from Young to Thomas, but David Pino missed the extra point, allowing the Cowboys to retain the lead. Oklahoma State scored another touchdown and Texas completed a field goal to make the score 21<U+2013>9 at the end of the first&nbsp;quarter. The Cowboys scored one touchdown in the second&nbsp;quarter off of a pass that was deflected by Texas, and Texas made a field goal near the end to cut into the lead, leaving Oklahoma State ahead 28<U+2013>12 at halftime. The second&nbsp;half was dominated by Texas as they scored five&nbsp;unanswered touchdowns to win the game. The scores consisted of two&nbsp;rushing touchdowns by Vince Young, two&nbsp;rushing touchdowns by Ramonce Taylor, and a 21&nbsp;yard touchdown pass to Neale Tweedie.<ref name="OkSU-box"/>

Despite Oklahoma State's 0<U+2013>4&nbsp;start to conference play, they led Texas the entire first half, including a lead of as much as nineteen&nbsp;points.

Texas was stopped on their first drive due to an unsuccessful [[Glossary of American football#F|fourth down conversion]].

In order to win the 2004&nbsp;game against the [[Kansas Jayhawks football|Kansas Jayhawks]], Texas had to convert a 4th-and-18&nbsp;situation and complete a touchdown pass with only eleven&nbsp;seconds remaining on the clock.<ref name="2004 Kansas">{{cite news | url=http://kuathletics.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/recaps/111304aaa.html | title=Texas Escapes with a 27<U+2013>23 Win Over Kansas | work=CSTV.com | publisher=CSTV Networks, Inc. | date=November 13, 2004 | accessdate=2007-03-17}}</ref> The 2005&nbsp;game provided much less on-field drama, as Texas led 52<U+2013>0 by halftime and defeated Kansas 66<U+2013>14.<ref name="Kansas box">{{cite news | url=http://www.mackbrown-texasfootball.com/000_stats/05/ut10.htm | title=Kansas vs Texas (Nov 12, 2005) | work=MackBrown-TexasFootball.com | publisher=University of Texas & Host Interactive | accessdate=2007-09-04}}</ref>

In the first&nbsp;quarter, Texas scored touchdowns on a pass to Limas Sweed, a run by Jamaal Charles, a pass to Quan Cosby, and a [[Glossary of American football#P|punt return]] by Aaron Ross. In the second&nbsp;quarter, the Longhorns had a touchdown run by Ramonce Taylor and touchdown catches from David Thomas and Peter Ullman. David Pino also kicked a field goal for the Horns. In the third&nbsp;quarter, Kansas opened the scoring with a 59-yard touchdown by [[Jon Cornish]]. Taylor scored another touchdown.

UT fans were unhappy with [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s television coverage of the event. The network elected to stick with the Oklahoma vs. Texas A&M game instead of switching to the Kansas vs. Texas game. ABC stayed with the Oklahoma vs. A&M game through the final down and then ran three&nbsp;full minutes of commercials while the Texas vs. Kansas game continued. By the time they switched over Texas was already leading 14<U+2013>0.

The game's outcome was in doubt until the final minute of play. With 19&nbsp;seconds left on the game clock, Vince Young ran for a touchdown and regained the lead for the Longhorns. He followed up by running the ball into the end zone for a two-point conversion. Leinart had time to attempt one pass but his pass fell out of bounds as time expired; UT beat USC by the score of 41<U+2013>38.<ref name="USC-recap">{{cite news| url=http://www.mackbrown-texasfootball.com/000_stats/05/rosebowl.htm | title=Texas vs Southern California | date=January 4, 2006 | work=MackBrown-TexasFootball.com | publisher=University of Texas & Host Interactive | accessdate=2006-07-30}}</ref>

Young completed 30&nbsp;of 40&nbsp;passes for 267&nbsp;yards and carried the ball 19&nbsp;times for 200&nbsp;yards and 3&nbsp;rushing touchdowns.

The 2005&nbsp;season marks only the eighth&nbsp;time in 50&nbsp;years that exactly two&nbsp;teams have gone into the bowl season undefeated.

If more than two&nbsp;undefeated teams remain, then one or more of those teams must be left out.
