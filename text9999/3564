'''John "Dok" Hager''' (1858-1932) was an American cartoonist for the [[Seattle Times|Seattle Daily Times]], creator of a daily comic accompanying the weather report, and the [[comic strip]] ''Dok's Dippy Duck''.<ref name=timesobit>[http://www.genealogybank.com/gbnk/newspapers/doc/v2:127D718D1E33F961%40GBNEWS-1296D583AECF74C0%40-1296CF8125531C4D%40/ Seattle Daily Times, June 20, 1932, page 1, column 5, bottom.

</ref> Hager's nickname stems from his time as a [[dentist]] in [[Terre Haute, Indiana]] before he moved to [[Seattle, Washington]] in 1889 and began working for the ''Seattle Times''.<ref name=timesobit/><ref name=bio/>  Hager retired in 1925 due to blindness.<ref name=timesobit/><ref name=bio/>

In Seattle he was known as a weatherman and for his commentaries (using a cartoon of the [[Robert W. Patten|Umbrella Man]] and of a talking duck).<ref name=timesobit/>

==Background==
He was the son of Jacob H. Hager and Carrie Ross of [[Terra Haute, Indiana]].<ref name=bio/> Before moving to Indiana, his family had lived in [[Hagerstown, Maryland]].<ref name=bio/> He married Anna Hyde, who gave him four children.<ref name=bio/> Two of his children were alive when he died.

After he attended school in Europe (his obituary says Germany, but his passport application said Zurich, Switzerland), he set up as a dentist in Terra Haute. He moved to Seattle in 1899, where he continued as a dentist. in 1909 he began cartooning full-time with the Seattle Daily Times and gave up his practice.

===Son George Hager===
His son, [[George Hager]] was also an artist in Seattle, working as an illustrator for the town's rival newspaper, The Seattle Post-Intelligencer.<ref name=bio/> He also edited children's page for the [[Christian Science Monitor]]<ref name=bio/>  George Hager studied art at the University of Washington and the [[Arts Student League]] in New York, where another Seattle cartoonist, [[William Charles McNulty]] taught.<ref name=bio/> Both Hagers participated in the [[Seattle Cartoonists' Club]], contributing caricatures of the famous men of Seattle for the club's book, ''The Cartoon; A Reference Book of Seattle's Successful Men''.<ref name=club>{{cite book |title=The Cartoon; A Reference Book of Seattle's Successful Men |last=Calvert|first=Frank|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/cartoonreference00calv#page/n5/mode/2up|year=1911|publisher=The Press of Trustee Printing Company |location=Seattle, Washington|isbn= |pages=}}</ref>

==Cartoons==
[[File:First Umbrella Man cartoon.png|thumb|left|Doc Hager's first Umbrella Man cartoon, to illustrate the weather November 1, 1909 in the Seattle Daily Times.]]

===Umbrella Man and the Kid===

====Umbrella Man====
Beginning November 1, 1909, Dok created a daily cartoon to accompany ''The Weather'',<ref name=sport>[http://www.genealogybank.com/gbnk/newspapers/doc/v2%3A127D718D1E33F961%40GBNEWS-128911CF1243BA54%402418612-12822CE2F1EA50BF%400/ Seattle Daily Times, November 1, 1909, page 1.]</ref> which featured a character who came to be known as the [[Robert W. Patten|Umbrella Man]], or "Sport". 
In the newspaper on May 3, 1913, the weather comic was called ''The Umbrella Man'', in a front<U+2013>page box naming the paper's features. Later on, as Dok began to do more cartooning, he gave Sport a sidekick, named the Kid.

====The Kid====
''The Kid'' was a talking duck. He was not part of the ''Dippy Duck'' or ''The Waddles'' cartoon strips, but was the sidekick to the Umbrella Man.<ref name=histlink>[http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&File_Id=3149 Historylink.org. ''Patten, Robert W. (1832-1913), Seattle's famed Umbrella Man''. ]</ref>  He became a regular feature on the front page of ''The Seattle Times''. Like the Umbrella Man, the Kid sometimes sported an umbrella hat. The two wandered the streets of Seattle in the comic, dispensing wit and wisdom along with weather forecasts.<ref name=histlink/>

===Other cartoon ducks===

====Dok's Dippy Duck====
[[File:Dok's Dippy Duck sample.pdf|thumb|right|Sample of ''Dok's Dippy Duck'' from the Seattle Daily Times, February 11, 1915. The comic strip ran on the first page. At the time the strip was dealing with the tensions in Europe and World War I.]]

DOK's comic strip, ''Dok's Dippy Duck'' started out as a daily comic strip without a name, May 31, 1912.<ref name=beginning>[http://www.genealogybank.com/gbnk/newspapers/doc/v2%3A127D718D1E33F961%40GBNEWS-128BA6692D745760%402419554-128BA5085693D11C%400/ ''Seattle Daily Times'', May 31, 1912, page 1.]</ref>  In the early strip, the unnamed duck stood around on the street corner picking fights with whomever passed by.<ref name=beginning/> Doc's duck became a traveler during World War I and the cartoons show him interacting with both sides of the conflict.<ref name=Dippy>[http://www.genealogybank.com/gbnk/newspapers/doc/v2%3A127D718D1E33F961%40GBNEWS-12923AF3AF3205D6%402420539-1292355FDFD1A335%400/ ''Seattle Daily Times'', February 10, 1915, page 1.]</ref> The duck in this cartoon is also known as ''The Kid''.<ref name=dippykid>[http://www.genealogybank.com/gbnk/newspapers/doc/v2%3A127D718D1E33F961%40GBNEWS-12923AF565033F46%402420540-1292359B2EC503B6%400/ Seattle Daily Times, February 11, 1915, page 1. ''Dok's Dippy Duck''.]</ref>

On May 3, 1913, in a front-page box called "Features of Today's Paper", Dok's cartoon was called "''The Duck''. By Dok."

On February 10, 1915, the strip was named ''Dok's Dippy Duck'' with no change in what was happening in the plot; the February 10 strip addressed what had happened in the previous day's strip.<ref name=Dippy/> One change that did happen was to make the comic vertical and larger, with fewer frames; it had only four frames,<ref name=Dippy/> where earlier strips had as many as seven.<ref name=beginning/>

This cartoon has been characterized by a comic historian as one of the pioneers of humanized animal comic strips.<ref name=dippy>[http://www.lambiek.net/artists/h/hager_d.htm Lambiek.net. ''Dok Hager(1858 - 1932, USA)'']</ref>

====The Kid becomes Waddles====
[[Image:DOK's Duck.png|thumb|left| By the time that the artists of the Seattle Cartoonists' Club put together their book ''The Cartoon; A Reference Book of Seattle's Successful Men'', the Kid was well enough known to be included in the book without the Umbrella Man. Other area cartoonists had a regular commentary animal, and the public recognized the talking duck as being Dok's.]]

Waddles was a duck drawn by George Hager for the [[Christian Science Monitor]] in the cartoon strip ''The Adventures of the Waddles''. According to the Seattle Daily Times, Waddles was a continuation of the his father's duck, associated with the weather man.<ref name=continued>[http://www.genealogybank.com/gbnk/newspapers/doc/v2:127D718D1E33F961%40GBNEWS-129A25E3ABC3B1F1%40-128E41805CBA6789%40/ Seattle Daily Times, November 9, 1935, page2, column 2. ''Strolling around the town''.]</ref> Dok had to discontinue his illustrating when his eyes went, and his children ran the Waddles comic strip.<ref name=waddle/> Dok's daughter, Mrs. George Dearborne wrote the rhyming lines to go with the cartoon, while son George Hager did the illustration.<ref name=continued/><ref name=waddle>[http://strippersguide.blogspot.com/2007_09_30_archive.html Allan Holz, The Stripper's Guide blog. ''The Adventures of the Waddles: Week 1. Thursday, October 04, 2007.]</ref>
