The '''Fairchild T-46''' was an [[United States|American]] light jet [[trainer aircraft]] of the 1980s. It was cancelled in 1986 with only three aircraft being produced.

==Design and development==
The [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) launched its [[Next Generation Trainer]] (NGT) program  to replace the [[Cessna]] [[T-37 Tweet]] primary trainer in 1981.<ref name="Bray p274">Braybrook 1985, p. 274.</ref> Fairchild-Republic submitted a shoulder-winged [[monoplane]] with a twin-tail, powered by two [[Garrett F109]] [[turbofan]]s and with pilot and instructor sitting side-by-side.<ref name="Bray p275">Braybrook 1985, p. 275.</ref> 

In order to validate the proposed aircraft's design, and to explore its flight handling characteristics, Fairchild Republic contracted with Ames Industries of [[Bohemia, New York]] to build a flyable 62% scale version. [[Burt Rutan]]'s [[Rutan Aircraft Factory]] (RAF) in [[Mojave, California]] was contracted to perform the flight test evaluations, with test pilot [[Dick Rutan]] doing the flying. The scale version was known at RAF as the '''Model 73 NGT''', this flying on 10 September 1981.<ref name="Bray p275-6">Braybrook 1985, pp. 275<U+2013>276.</ref>

Fairchild's design, to be designated T-46,  was announced winner of the NGT competition on July 2, 1982,<ref name="Bray p275"/> with the USAF placing an order for two prototypes and options for 54 production aircraft.<ref>''Flight International'' 17 July 1982, p. 122.</ref>

The aircraft first flew on October 15, 1985,<ref>''Flight International'' 26 October 1985, p. 8.</ref> but was cancelled a little more than a year later, for reasons that largely remain controversial. The T-46 was the last project of the Fairchild Republic Corporation, and after the program termination Fairchild had no more income. Without any new contracts and the NGT program cancelled, the company closed the Republic factory in [[Farmingdale, New York]], bringing 60 years of Fairchild aircraft manufacturing to an end.

The aircraft itself featured a side by side configuration, a twin (or "H") tail (similar to the company's [[A-10 Thunderbolt II|A-10]]), [[ejection seat]]s, pressurization, and two [[turbofan]] engines.  Had it gone into full production the NGT program called for 650 aircraft being built up to 1992. There was potential for some overseas sales as well, such as in the light ground attack role in addition to its role as a trainer.<ref name="Warwick p29">Warwick 1985, p. 29.</ref>
