==Early life and education==

Born in [[Haiti]], Racine and his family fled the [[Jean-Claude Duvalier|Duvalier]] regime and emigrated to Washington, D.C. when he was three years old.<ref name=bisnow/> He attended public schools until 11th grade and graduated from [[St. John's College High School]],<ref name=bisnow/> and was star high school basketball player.<ref name=WP.announcement/>

Racine attended the [[University of Pennsylvania]] and the [[University of Virginia School of Law]], where he worked at a pro bono clinic representing migrant farm workers.<ref name=LCLD/><ref name=bisnow/> He said he was drawn to the law because of the role lawyers played in advancing civil rights.<ref name=bisnow/> While in law school, he and his mother produced the first [[Haitian Creole]]/English legal dictionary, intended to aid Haitian immigrants to the United States.<ref name=LCLD/>

==Legal career==

After graduating from law school in 1989, Racine joined Venable LLP but left in 1992 to become a staff attorney at the D.C. Public Defender Service.<ref name=LCLD/><ref name=WP.announcement/> He then he returned to private practice at Cacheris & Treanor, where he handled large white-collar and civil cases,<ref name=LCLD/> and later served as associate White House counsel in the [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton administration]].<ref name=LCLD/><ref name=bizjournal/> In addition, he served as a member of the D.C. Judicial Nomination Commission,<ref name=nominationcommission/> a selection panel for judges. Racine returned to Venable in 2000 and was elected managing partner in 2006, becoming the first [[Black people|black]] managing partner of a top-100 law firm.<ref name=LCLD/><ref name=WP.announcement/><ref name=bizjournal/>

He led the team representing [[food services]] corporation [[Sodexo]] in a [[class action]] [[Racism|racial]] [[Anti-discrimination law|discrimination]] suit brought by over 2,500 [[African American]] employees, one of the largest such suits brought after the [[Civil Rights Act of 1991|1991 amendments]] to [[Civil Rights Act of 1964#Title VII|Title VII]] of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]].<ref name=npr/><ref name=dcbio/>

From 2011 to 2012, Racine represented [[Council of the District of Columbia|D.C. Councilmember]] [[Harry Thomas Jr.]], who pled guilty after a protracted investigation to diverting $300,000 in grants earmarked for charity and youth baseball groups to pay for personal luxury items.<ref name=legaltimes/> During sentencing, Racine successfully argued that Thomas deserved a lighter sentence because his guilty plea was an example of his commitment to teaching the District's youth how <U+201C>take responsibility when you have done wrong.<U+201D><ref name=WCP.announcement/><ref name=WP.announcement/><ref name=WCP.htjsentencing/> Racine later said Thomas <U+201C>needed counsel to represent him zealously<U+201D> and told possible critics, <U+201C>I would represent them if, God forbid, they made significant mistakes, errors and violated the law.<U+201D><ref name=WP.announcement/>

In July 2014, Racine led an inquest into state-issued credit card spending by [[State school|public school]] [[teacher]]s in [[Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery County]], [[Maryland]], finding no evidence of intentional wrongdoing but recommending that access to the cards be revoked.<ref name="fox"/><ref name="gazette"/><ref name="bethesda"/>

==Campaign for Attorney General==

In July 2014, Racine announced his candidacy for D.C. Attorney General, prompting friend and fellow prominent white-collar attorney [[Mark Tuohey]] to drop out of the race and endorse him, saying he <U+201C>has all the qualifications<U+201D>.<ref name=WCP.announcement/><ref name=WP.announcement/><ref name=revolving/>

As of August 12, Racine's campaign had raised $256,955, more than any of the 4 other candidates for Attorney General.<ref name=WCP.dig/><ref name=WP.muriel/> Notably, the bulk of his funding came from loans and contributions made by Racine himself, totaling $225,000.<ref name=WCP.dig/><ref name=WP.muriel/>

On August 28, [[Washingtonian (magazine)|''Washingtonian'' magazine]] reported that three anonymous staff members at the Office of the Attorney General had filed complaints with the D.C. Board of Elections alleging two OAG employees, including Attorney General [[Irvin B. Nathan]], had violated the [[Hatch Act of 1939|Hatch Act]] by promoting Racine's campaign at work.<ref name=washingtonian2/> According to the complaints, Nathan <U+201C>praised and recommended Karl Racine, and he asked us to support him<U+201D> during two meetings on July 9, before Racine had declared he would run for office.<ref name=washingtonian2/> In an interview, Racine stated that <U+201C>Nathan did not recruit<U+201D> him <U+201C>to run for the attorney generalship<U+201D> and that he would have no reason to believe that Nathan would conduct himself in any other way than <U+201C>appropriately [and] ethically<U+201D>.<ref name=kojo/>

Media sources have characterized Racine as the candidate who reflects the legal establishment.<ref name=WP.announcement/><ref name=WCP.dcvote/><ref name=afro/> If elected, Racine said he would act with greater independence from the [[Mayor of the District of Columbia|Mayor]] and the D.C. Council.<ref name=kojo/><ref name=WCP.dcvote/> He supports Attorney General Irvin Nathan's argument that the D.C. budget autonomy act violates the [[District of Columbia Home Rule Act]].<ref name=WCP.dcvote/> Racine has released a 12-page policy platform called <U+201C>Keys to Justice<U+201D>.<ref>{{cite web|title=Keys to Justice: Unlocking Fairness for Everyone in Our City|url=http://votekarlracine.com/keystojustice.pdf|website=VoteKarlRacine.com|accessdate=7 October 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=DeBonis|first1=Mike|title=DCision <U+2019>14 potpourri: Catania wins Sierra Club nod; AG candidates hit the mail|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/mike-debonis/wp/2014/10/03/dcision-14-potpourri-catania-wins-sierra-club-nod-ag-candidates-hit-the-mail/|website=Washington Post|accessdate=7 October 2014}}</ref>

Racine initially expressed disapproval of the initiative to [[Legality of cannabis|legalize marijuana]] in August, saying that it <U+201C>is going to take a bit more time for the community to get its head around,<U+201D><ref name=kojo/> but had apparently reversed his position by late September, <U+201C>enthusiastically<U+201D> supporting legalization in a debate.<ref name=WAMU.debate/> The Washington City Paper suggested Racine [[Flip-flop (politics)|flip-flopped]] after a poll showed nearly two thirds of D.C. residents were supportive of marijuana legalization.<ref name=WCP.marijuana>{{cite news|title=Marijuana Wins Over Karl Racine |url=http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/blogs/looselips/2014/10/02/marijuana-wins-over-karl-racine/ |accessdate=5 October 2014 |agency=Washington City Paper |date=2 October 2014}}</ref><ref name=WaPo.marijuana>{{cite news|title=Poll: D.C. voters poised to legalize pot, elevating national debate over marijuana |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/poll-dc-voters-poised-to-legalize-pot-elevating-national-debate-over-marijuana/2014/09/18/08360f90-3dfe-11e4-b0ea-8141703bbf6f_story.html |accessdate=5 October 2014 |agency=The Washington Post |date=18 September 2014}}</ref>

Racine had raised an additional $407,736 by the October 10 reporting deadline, more than any other candidate, with $225,000 of that total from a second personal loan from Racine to his campaign.<ref name=WCP.deadline2>{{cite news|title=Racine Puts in Another $225K to Lead Attorney General<U+2019>s Race Fundraising |url=http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/blogs/looselips/2014/10/14/racine-puts-in-another-225k-to-lead-attorney-generals-race-fundraising/ |accessdate=17 October 2014 |agency=Washington City Paper |date=14 October 2014}}</ref> One week after the reporting deadline, on October 17, fellow candidate [[Edward "Smitty" Smith]] filed a request for investigation with the D.C. Office of Campaign Finance, alleging that Racine's failure to list occupation information for 266 individual contributors and employer information for all 390 individual contributors in the report constituted an <U+201C>intentional and illegal<U+201D> breach of the Campaign Finance Act of 2011.<ref name=WCP.investigation>{{cite news|title=Attorney General Candidate Wants Investigation of Rival<U+2019>s Fundraising |url=http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/blogs/looselips/2014/10/17/attorney-general-candidate-wants-investigation-of-rivals-fundraising/ |accessdate=17 October 2014 |agency=Washington City Paper |date=17 October 2014}}</ref> Racine's campaign attributed the missing information to <U+201C>a botched fundraising database transfer<U+201D> and promised to amend the report.<ref name=WCP.investigation/>

On October 22 and 23, the Washington City Paper and the Washington Post ran a series of articles on a slate of audits that found Venable had improperly documented expenses charged to the [[Troubled Asset Relief Program]] and overcharged the D.C. government, including the Office of the Attorney General, by hundreds of thousands of dollars while Racine was the managing partner of the firm.<ref name=WCP.karlsincharge /><ref name=WCP.slamrivals /><ref name=wapo.audits /> At a press conference the next day, opponent [[Lorie Masters]] criticized Racine for overbilling and his allegedly <U+201C>cozy<U+201D> relationship with embattled [[Mayor of the District of Columbia|D.C. Mayor]] [[Vincent C. Gray]].<ref name=WCP.slamrivals /><ref name=wapo.audits />
