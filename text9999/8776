==Music video==
An official music video for the song was released onto [[YouTube]] on 8 August 2013.<ref name="youtube">{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg2vpkGQadM |title=Editors - Formaldehyde (Directed By Ben Wheatley) |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=8 August 2013 |accessdate=3 September 2013}}</ref> It was directed by [[Ben Wheatley]], a critically acclaimed British feature film director, marking his debut in the music video genre. The video, which was shot in the style of old [[spaghetti western]]s, stars Simon Smith and Tilly Gaunt.<ref name="DIY">{{cite web|url=http://www.thisisfakediy.co.uk/articles/news/watch-editors-showcase-new-video-for-formaldehyde/ |title=Watch: Editors Showcase New Video For 'Formaldehyde' |work=[[This Is Fake DIY]] |first=Sarah |last=Jamieson |date=8 August 2013 |accessdate=3 September 2013}}</ref>

"We shot on the old sets for [[Sergio Leone]]'s ''[[Once Upon a Time in the West]]'' in [[Almer<U+00ED>a]] in [[Spain]]. It was quite an experience. The sun is so bright and strong (I've just shot four features in a row in the UK; that kind of thing impresses me!). The mountains look amazing and everywhere you look you feel the vibe of the spaghetti westerns," stated Wheatley. "We shot the promo in a day and it was pretty frantic but good fun. We worked with a great bunch of Spanish cowboy/stuntmen/extras who wore the incredibly heavy and awkward masks with good grace. Hopefully one day I will get to return to Almer<U+00ED>a and shoot a feature film."<ref name="journalist">{{cite web|url=http://thejournalist.ie/entertainment/music-news-editors-unviel-new-single-formaldehyde/ |title=Editors unveil new video <U+2018>Formaldehyde<U+2019> |first=Stephen |last=White |publisher=thejournalist.ie |date=8 August 2013 |accessdate=3 September 2013}}</ref>

Kevin Jagernauth of [[IndieWire]] wrote that "the results are appropriately freaky. The largely slow-mo video starts off with what appears to be a standard western setting, before some dudes in scary masks show up and the whole thing tips into the surreal by the finale. Yep, sounds like Wheatley."<ref name="indie wire">{{cite web|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/watch-ben-wheatley-directed-music-video-for-editors-formaldehyde-20130808| title=Watch: Ben Wheatley Directed Music Video For Editors' <U+201C>Formaldehyde<U+201D> |first=Kevin |last=Jagernauth |publisher=[[IndieWire]] |date=8 August 2013 |accessdate=3 September 2013}}</ref>
