'''Paul Winter''' (born August 31, 1939 in [[Altoona, Pennsylvania]]) is an [[United States|American]] [[Saxophone|saxophonist]] (alto and soprano saxophone), and is a six-time [[Grammy Award]] winner.

== Biography ==
Paul attended [[Altoona Area High School]] graduating in 1957. In 1961, while Winter was in college at [[Northwestern University]], the [[Paul Winter Sextet]] won the [[Intercollegiate Jazz Festival]] and was signed by [[Columbia Records]]. 

The next year, the band toured [[Latin America]] as cultural ambassadors for the [[United States State Department]], playing 160 concerts in 23 countries.  The Sextet was also the first jazz band to perform at the [[White House]].

Winter returned to Brazil in the mid-1960s and his interest in Brazilian music and the emerging [[bossa nova]] led to the 1965 release of the album ''Rio'', with liner notes by [[Vinicius de Moraes]].

After Winter's band changed its name to the [[Paul Winter Consort]] in the late 1960s, it contributed to the development of [[world music]] and [[space music]]. The Consort's 1972 release, ''Icarus'', was produced by [[Sir George Martin|George Martin]]. Most of the musicians who worked on this album went on to form the jazz group [[Oregon (band)|Oregon]]. The Consort has continued over the years with different musicians.

He was awarded the Courage of Conscience Award for creating music that celebrates the sacredness of life and for his support of the arts by the Peace Abbey in Sherborn, MA on October 26 1991. <ref>[http://www.peaceabbey.org/awards/cocrecipientlist.html The Peace Abbey Courage of Conscience Recipients List<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
