The '''Federal Highway''' (official designation: '''National Highway 23''') is a short [[highway]] in [[New South Wales]] and the [[Australian Capital Territory]] in [[Australia]]. It is a part of the Sydney-Canberra [[National Highway (Australia)|National Highway]] link.

The Federal Highway starts at its junction with the [[Hume Highway]] near the city of [[Goulburn, New South Wales|Goulburn]].  It runs about eighty kilometres south west to [[Canberra]], the national capital of Australia.  The Federal Highway runs past [[Lake George, New South Wales|Lake George]].

It was initially constructed from [[1932]] to [[1934]], replacing the previous access from Goulburn (via [[Tarago, New South Wales|Tarago]] and [[Queanbeyan, New South Wales|Queanbeyan]]). From [[1986]] onwards, the Federal Highway was reconstructed to a full four-lane divided highway standard, a project finally completed in [[2000]].
