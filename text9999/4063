The '''Toronto subway and RT''' is the main [[rapid transit]] [[railway]] system in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]] operated by the [[Toronto Transit Commission]] (TTC). Since the original line following [[Yonge Street]] opened in 1954, the network has expanded to become Canada's longest rapid transit rail network, encompassing four lines and [[List of Toronto TTC stations|69 stations]] on 61.9 kilometres (38.5 miles) of track; this includes the RT's 6 stations with 6.4 kilometres (4.0 miles) of track.  The subway system is a very popular mode of [[public transport]] in Toronto and the largest in Canada in terms of passenger usage, with an average of 1,186,050 passenger trips each weekday (as of 2005-2006).

The TTC sometimes uses the term "rapid transit" internally to describe all four lines, but in general public usage there is no collective term. They are called the three "subway" lines and "the [[Scarborough RT (TTC)|(Scarborough) RT]]".  

A current focus for the TTC's rapid-transit expansion is an extension bringing the western branch of the Yonge-University-Spadina Line north to [[York University]], [[Steeles Avenue]] and [[Vaughan Corporate Centre]] in [[Regional Municipality of York, Ontario|York Region]].

The Government of Ontario announced on March 23, 2006 that it will provide $670 million for this extension, about one-third of the expected cost. If built, the extension would be approximately 6.2 km long and would likely be built with six new stations: [[Sheppard West (TTC)|Sheppard West]], [[Finch West (TTC)|Finch West]], [[York University (TTC)|York University]], [[Steeles West (TTC)|Steeles West]], Highway 407 Transitway and Vaughan Corporate Centre. It is expected to cost approximately $2 billion. An environmental assessment has been completed to Steeles Avenue.

== History ==
[[Image:Front street excavation.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Subway excavations on Front Street in 1950]]
=== Yonge-University line (1954-1963) ===
The first segment of the subway, which replaced a heavily-used [[Toronto streetcar system|streetcar route]], ran under and next to [[Yonge Street]] from [[Eglinton Avenue]] to [[King Street (Toronto)|King Street]]. The route then turned west, to the southernmost station, at Front and Bay, underneath to the city's main railway terminus, [[Union Station (Toronto)|Union Station]]. This line was completed in 1954. It was 6.5 km long.

In 1963, an extension was added, north from Union Station, below [[University Avenue (Toronto)|University Avenue]], to just south of [[Bloor Street]], where it turned west to terminate at St George and Bloor.
{{Main|Yonge-University-Spadina (TTC)}}

=== Bloor-Danforth line (1966-1968) ===
The very existence of the Danforth line, opened in 1966, is thanks to a decision made more than forty years earlier. When the [[Prince Edward Viaduct]] was built in 1919, its designer insisted on building twin decks below the roadway to allow for future rail traffic. Thanks to that decision, the subway is able to cross the Don River ravine to Danforth Avenue on the east side.
{{Main|Bloor-Danforth (TTC)}}

=== Yonge line extension (1973-1974) ===
The Yonge-University line was extended north 8 km from Eglinton and Yonge to Finch Avenue and Yonge in 1973 and 1974.

=== Spadina extension (1978) ===
A further 12 km was added to the Yonge-University Line at St George and Bloor, running north-west to Eglinton and [[William R. Allen Road]], where it turned north to run down the centre of the Allen Road, to Wilson Avenue and the Allen Road.

=== Bloor-Danforth extension (1980) ===
Extensions were added at the west and east end of the Bloor-Danforth Line. These extensions each added a single station, and much needed bus bays to connect to surface routes, and, on the eastern end, room to connect to the Scarborough RT.

=== Scarborough RT (1985) ===
The Scarborough RT is an intermediate-capacity line built almost entirely above ground, which has no direct track connections to the other lines and uses a separate fleet of [[Bombardier Advanced Rapid Transit|ICTS]] trains based on dramatically different technology (similar to those of the [[Vancouver SkyTrain]]). Nevertheless, its operating practices are the same as those of the other three lines. The route is fully isolated from road traffic and pedestrians, the stations are fully covered, and the trains are boarded through many doors from high platforms within a fare-paid zone set off by a barrier. The TTC therefore includes it with the other rapid transit lines for mapping and administrative purposes.
{{Main|Scarborough RT (TTC)}}

=== Spadina extension (1996) ===
An additional kilometre was added to the north end of the Spadina arm of the Yonge-University-Spadina line, adding a station (Downsview Station) with bus-bays for connections to surface routes. At the time, a newly elected provincial [[Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario|Progressive Conservative]] government cancelled their share of funding that would have extended this route northward to [[York University]] and [[Steeles Avenue]]. This extension is again under serious consideration (''see [[Toronto subway and RT#Future expansion|Future expansion]]'').

=== Sheppard line (2002) ===
The Sheppard line, opened in 2002, runs 5.5 km east, from Sheppard Station on the Yonge line (now renamed Sheppard-Yonge), near the north end of the Yonge-University-Spadina Line.
{{Main|Sheppard (TTC)}}

===Renovations===
The Museum, Osgoode and St. Patrick subway stations will be renovated to provide transit riders with a visual experience linking them to the major cultural institutions in the area, such as the [[Royal Ontario Museum]], [http://www.gardinermuseum.on.ca Gardiner Museum], [[Textile Museum of Canada]], [[Art Gallery of Ontario]], [[Ontario College of Art and Design]] and the [[Four Seasons Centre for the Performing Arts]].
* Further info:  [http://www.tcf.ca/pdf/OntSubwayFundingRelease8June06.pdf Arts on Track]

===Future expansion===
The TTC has placed a lower priority on rapid-transit expansion, contingent upon additional funding: maintenance of the present system, increasing the present system's capacity, and fare initiatives are currently considered higher funding priorities. [[Image:TTCsubwayRTmap-2015-upd.png|thumb|right|500px|The TTC subway/RT network as it may appear in 2015; the two major proposed extensions, [[Yonge-University-Spadina (TTC)#Future expansion|Spadina North]] and [[Sheppard (TTC)#Future expansion|Sheppard East]], appear grey; the former extends northwestward to the planned [[Vaughan Corporate Centre]] in the neighbouring [[Vaughan, Ontario|city of Vaughan]] in [[Regional Municipality of York, Ontario|York Region]].]]

Through its Rapid Transit Expansion Strategy (RTES), the TTC has identified two major subway expansion projects until 2015. One is the eventual eastward extension of the [[Sheppard (TTC)|Sheppard line]] from [[Don Mills (TTC)|Don Mills station]] to [[Scarborough Centre (TTC)|Scarborough Centre station]] ''(see the [[Sheppard (TTC)|Sheppard line]] article for more details)''.

Another is the extension of the [[Yonge-University-Spadina (TTC)|Yonge-University-Spadina line]] from [[Downsview (TTC)|Downsview station]] through [[York University]] to [[Steeles Avenue]] and up to the proposed [[Vaughan Corporate Centre]] in the city's northern neighbour, the City of [[Vaughan, Ontario|Vaughan]], which is part of the [[Regional Municipality of York, Ontario|Regional Municipality of York]]. Receiving increased attention recently, this extension to Steeles Avenue has passed the third phase of Environmental Assessment and an alignment has been established.  The six proposed stations are provisionally named [[Sheppard West(TTC)|Sheppard West]], [[Finch West (TTC)|Finch West]], [[York University (TTC)|York University]], [[Steeles West (TTC)|Steeles West]], [[Highway 407 Transitway (TTC)|Highway 407 Transitway]], and Vaughan Corporate Centre.

The current provincial [[Liberal Party of Ontario|Liberal]] government will provide $670 million to a trust fund earmarked for the Spadina subway extension. With no obstacles and full funding commitments from senior government, the [[Canadian dollar|$]]2 billion expansion would be operational by 2013 at the earliest.

In addition, the TTC is currently considering options for revitalizing the [[Scarborough RT (TTC)|Scarborough RT]] line, since its fleet of trains are approaching the end of their lifespan and the line is already overcrowded. Replacing the trains is complicated by the fact that the original [[Bombardier Advanced Rapid Transit|ICTS]] vehicles used by the line are no longer produced, and their newer counterparts are longer and so would require expensive upgrades to the existing track. As a result, the TTC is also considering other options including an extension of the [[Bloor-Danforth (TTC)|Bloor-Danforth]] subway along a different alignment, converting the Scarborough RT to a dedicated right-of-way for [[Toronto streetcar system|streetcar]]s (as was originally planned), and replacing it with a [[bus rapid transit]] line. The Government of Ontario has provided $1 million for an environmental assessment relating to the future of "the Scarborough subway".

==Subway facts==
[[Image:Toronto ttc car subway.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Inside a subway car, at the east end of the tracks.]]
Like most subways, the Toronto subway/RT trains collect their [[electricity|electric]] power from a [[third rail]] mounted alongside the tracks. 'Shoes' mounted on the bogeys are located on both sides of each coach for the required contact. Power is supplied at 600 [[Volt|V]] [[Direct current|DC]].

Scarborough RT trains cannot switch directions except at the ends of the line as there are no turnback switches between the two termini.

In August 1995, the TTC suffered its worst subway accident in what it refers to as the [[Russell Hill Subway accident|Russell Hill accident]] on the Yonge-University-Spadina line. Three women died and 100 people were injured, a few seriously. This led to a major reorganization at the TTC, since contributing to maintaining a "state of good repair" (i.e., an increased emphasis on safety and maintenance of existing TTC capital/services) and less so on expansion.

[[GO Transit]] commuter trains stop at or near the [[Kipling (TTC)|Kipling]], [[Dundas West (TTC)|Dundas West]] (GO's Bloor station), [[Main Street (TTC)|Main Street]] (GO's Danforth station), [[Leslie (TTC)|Leslie]] (GO's Oriole station), and [[Kennedy (TTC)|Kennedy]] subway stations. The TTC's [[Union (TTC)|Union]] subway station connects with [[Union Station (Toronto)|Union Station]], Toronto's main railway station, which serves not only GO trains, but also [[VIA Rail|VIA]], [[Amtrak]], and [[Ontario Northland]]. GO buses connect with the TTC at a number of stations, and some other GO stations, while not connected to the subway, are served by buses or streetcars.

Suicides in the subway system have occurred in [[Toronto]], but it is not a common problem. Some have suggested the installation of barrier doors to prevent suicides and others from accidentally falling onto the tracks.

The only baby to be born on the subway is [[Mary Kim]] of [[Scarborough, Ontario]]. On [[February 6]], [[2006]], her mother, Sun Hee Paik, took the subway with her family to [[St. Michael's Hospital (Toronto)|St. Michael's Hospital]] from their Scarborough home. She did not make it to the downtown hospital and gave birth at [[Wellesley (TTC)|Wellesley subway station]]. Her husband delivered the baby and [[Toronto EMS]] arrived later to help finish the birth and send the mother and child to St. Michael's. TTC officials later promised to provide Mary with lifetime transit access.

Passengers are notified that the doors are closing and they are about to leave the station with a three note chime (G-E-C) [http://www.toronto.ca/ttc/ttchimes-nu3.wav].  This chime is instantly recognisable by most Torontonians and has become part of Toronto culture.

==Subway art==

Over time, Toronto's transit system has become a hidden art gallery, home to more than two dozen pieces scattered along the subway and streetcar routes.  

One of the most memorable distractions in the subway system is Charles Pachter<U+2019>s "Hockey Knights in Canada", added to College station in 1985. The two-part installation, just steps from [[Maple Leaf Gardens]], depicts the [[Montreal Canadiens]] and [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] squaring off from opposite sides of the subway tracks.

Dupont station features "A Spadina Summer Under All Seasons", an installation from the 1970s. Using thousands of pieces of glass, artist [[James Sutherland]] built colourful mosaics of flowers directly into the station<U+2019>s tiling. Two giant flowers face each other across the tracks, reaching upward into a mezzanine level lined with smaller flower mosaics.

The artwork at Dupont station was the most extensive in the Toronto transit system until the Sheppard line opened in 2002. The Sheppard-Yonge station features "Immersion Land", a mosaic composed of 1.5 million one-inch tiles, created by Toronto artist [[Stacey Spiegel]]. The installation was developed from a digitized and pixilated blend of 150 photographs depicting lush landscapes, country homes, and rural scenes from [[Yonge Street]] as it stretches towards [[North Bay, Ontario|North Bay]]. 

Each Sheppard line station has an artistic feature. The most notable of these is Leslie, a station that approaches the expanse of Dupont and Sheppard-Yonge<U+2019>s installations. Five years before the station opened, artist [[Micah Lexier]] began collecting writing samples from the public of the words <U+201C>Sheppard<U+201D> and <U+201C>Leslie<U+201D>. Over 3,000 of these samples were used in the installation, and the words were silk-screened onto tiles. In total, 17,000 of these tiles are on the walls of the station, each featuring the handwritten contribution of a community member. The installation was dubbed Ampersand in recognition of the <U+201C>&<U+201D> symbol <U+2013> the only consistent element of each tile.

USA Today said of Toronto's Sheppard Subway: Despite the remarkable engineering feats of this metro, known as Sheppard Subway, it's the art covering walls, ceilings and platforms of all five stations that stands out. Each station is 'a total art experience where artists have created imaginative environments, uniquely expressing themes of community, location and heritage' through panoramic landscapes and ceramic wall murals.
[http://www.usatoday.com/travel/destinations/10great/2004-09-02-subways_x.htm] 

[[Panya Clark Espinal]] is the artist who designed the art in the Bayview Station.

==Stations==
''For complete lists and details of stations, lines, and their locations in the Toronto subway/RT system, see [[Toronto subway and RT#Train network|"Train network" above]] and associated links.''

===Current stations===
Most stations are named for the nearest major road crossed by the line in question. A few are named for major landmarks, such as shopping centres or transportation hubs, served by the station. The University Avenue section of the Yonge-University-Spadina line, in particular, is named entirely for landmarks (public institutions and major churches).

All trains stop at every station along their route and run the entire length of their line from terminus to terminus, with the exception of every other train on the Yonge-University-Spadina line during rush hour<U+2014>these trains terminate at St. Clair West.

===Closed stations===
[[Image:TTCSubwayInterlined1966.svg|thumb|300px|TTC Interlining Trial|TTC Interlining Trial]]

The TTC has one closed subway station platform: the lower level of [[Bay (TTC)|Bay subway station]]. This subway station was briefly used for interlining between two of Toronto's lines in 1966, producing an effect similar to the "branching" lines of metro systems in some other cities. Interlining worked in that one would not have to switch trains to go from one line to another. The experiment, which lasted six months, proved to be impractical. A problem could hold up much of the system. It is said that chaos ensued as passengers at Bay did not know which platform their next train might end up on, causing people to wait on the stairs. Switching trains also did not significantly lengthen a commute, since at the point of departure one would have to wait anyhow for an interlined train heading to the desired destination. Today, Lower Bay is best known for its use in movie shoots and special events. The station has been modified several times to make it look like a "common" American subway station, and the TTC owns a pre-built set to disguise it as a [[New York City Subway]] station.

The tracks through Lower Bay still exist and are used from time to time to move equipment between lines. The junctions are just north of Museum station northbound and just west of Bloor-Yonge station. A second double-track connection links junctions just east of Spadina (Bloor-Danforth line) and just north (physically west) of St. George on the Yonge-University-Spadina Line.

A lesser known station is Lower Queen. In the plan that produced the original section of the Yonge subway, the TTC planned to build a second subway under Queen Street that would have been used not by dedicated rapid-transit trains but instead by regular streetcars in order to speed up their east-west passage through the downtown section. When the federal government refused to provide funding for the subway project, the TTC deferred the Queen subway, and by the time it came to revisit the east-west question, changing traffic patterns made the route under Bloor Street more sensible. The original Yonge subway's [[Queen (TTC)|Queen]] station, however, had been built with a roughed-in streetcar station on a lower level, ready for the second line if it should ever be built. Many people unknowingly pass through this second station every day, as the tunnel that goes under the station so that riders can move between northbound and southbound platforms is a portion of this underground station, with most of the excess infrastructure walled off.

The TTC also planned but did not construct a platform under [[Osgoode (TTC)|Osgoode]] station for the Queen line.

In the 1990s, the TTC began digging a platform under the existing [[Eglinton West (TTC)|Eglinton West]] for the [[Eglinton West subway|Eglinton subway]] project, but it was filled in again when the newly-elected conservative Government of Ontario cancelled the line in 1995.

That year provincial resources were immediately pulled out of the environment ministry, cutting its budget by nearly half and shifting focus away from urban planning. In addition to cancelling the planned subway line along Eglinton West, extension of the Spadina line to [[York University]] was also halted. (Moloney, 2002) By 1998, the province completely eliminated subsidies for the Toronto Transit Commission that had amounted to $104 million in 1995. (Theobald, 2003)

===Busiest stations===

The system's busiest subway stations are (in order):

# Bloor
# Yonge
# St George (Bloor-Danforth)
# St George (Yonge-University-Spadina)
# Finch
# Union
# Kennedy (Bloor-Danforth)							
# Eglinton										
# Sheppard-Yonge 							
# Queen							


==Track information==
For the most part, the subway system is composed of two parallel three-rail tracks. At most stations, particularly the older ones, the rails enter two separate bays in each station, one for Eastbound, one for Westbound (or North/Southbound). The newer stations, with some exceptions, use a single platform between the tracks. Older stations that were formerly termini also use a single platform between the tracks. Along the lines there are also storage tracks, a third set of rails longer than the length of a train, that can be used for resting or turning around. They are formally known in the TTC as centre tracks. 

These exist at the following locations:
* East of Islington Station
* East of Ossington Station
* West of Chester Station
* South of Lawrence West Station
* North of St. Clair West Station
* West of Union Station
* South of York Mills Station

Pocket tracks are also a variation of centre tracks, but can only be accessed from one end. The other end ends in a blocker. They can be found at:
*South of Osgoode Station (accessible from north end only)
*North of Eglinton Station (accessible from north end only)
*North of Finch Station (tail tracks)

Double crossovers, allowing for the switching of tracks exist at the following locations:

<table><tr><td valign=top>
* East of Kipling Station
* East of Islington Station
* East of Jane Station
* East of Keele Station
* East of St. George Station (both lines)
* West of Woodbine Station
* East of Victoria Park Station
* West of Warden Station (geographically south of the station)
* West of Kennedy Station (on the Bloor-Danforth line)
* South of Downsview Station
* South of Wilson Station
* North of Spadina Station (on the Yonge-University-Spadina line)
<td valign=top>
* North of Bloor Station
* South of Eglinton Station
* South of Lawrence Station
* South of Sheppard Station
* South of Finch Station
* West of Yonge Station (on the Sheppard line)
* East of Yonge Station (on the Sheppard line)
* West of Bayview Station
* West of Don Mills Station
* West of McCowan Station
* East of McCowan Station (in McCowan yard)
* North of Driver platform (in Wilson yard)
* South of Driver platform (in Greenwood yard)
</tr></td></table>

There is also a single crossover north of Union Station on the Yonge line that allows trains to come into Union from the north, enter what is now the platform designated "Northbound - University line", and turn around, heading back north towards Finch on the proper track. This would have been used when Union was the Yonge terminus until the University line was opened in the 1960s.

Other track "anomalies":
* The tracks used for interlining in the late 1960s:
** North of Museum Station the tracks split, one heading for Upper-St. George St, the other for the now abandoned Lower-Bay. 
*** The track headed to Lower-Bay joins up with the Bloor-Danforth line just before Yonge Station.
*** The track headed to Upper-St. George is what is now used for the University line.
** The tracks approaching St. George Station from Spadina split, one heading for Upper, the other for Lower-St. George.
* Single cross-overs, acting as entrances to the Vincent Yards, the Wilson Yards, the Davisville Yards, and the Downsview Yards.
* Between Donlands and Greenwood Stations the track splits in both directions, allowing trains to enter or exit the Greenwood Yards in either direction.
* A maintenance track, accessible from the eastbound Bloor-Danforth line, just west of Warden Station. Trains must back into this track and leave head-first.
* Short tail tracks at Don Mills Station. It is the only terminal station not to have train length tail tracks.
* The tracks used to transfer between the Sheppard and Yonge lines are as follows:
** From Northbound Yonge to Eastbound Sheppard: Simple track split on the Yonge line
*** This track meets the Sheppard Line East of Sheppard-Yonge Station, so trains must then back into the station.
** From the Westbound Sheppard track to Southbound Yonge: Trains go west, beyond the Sheppard-Yonge Station, the track then splits, one track onto the Eastbound Sheppard, the other to Southbound Yonge.
* There used to be more crossovers on the Yonge line, but three were removed when the University line was constructed
** The locations of the removed crossovers were: north of King Station, south of College Station (Gerrard Crossover), and south of St. Clair Station.
*** The cuts in the tunnels for the King and Gerrard Crossovers still exist to this day.

===Track gauge===
The tracks of Toronto's streetcars and subways (apart from the [[Scarborough RT]]) are built to the unique gauge of 1.495 m (4 feet 10 7/8 inches), 60 mm (2 3/8") wider than the usual standard of 1.435 m (4 feet 8 1/2 inches). One popular albeit false belief is that the City of Toronto feared that the [[Toronto Railway Company]], which held the franchise to run streetcars before the TTC was created, would allow [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] to operate steam locomotives through city streets. The more practical reason is that early tracks were used to pull wagons smoothly in the days before paved roads, and that they fit a different gauge. Due to the cost of converting all the tracks and vehicles (and the lack of any real benefit in doing so), the unique gauge has remained to this day.

Some proposals for the city's subway system involved using streetcars in the tunnels and possibly having some routes run partially in tunnels and partially on city streets, so the same gauge was used, though the idea was ultimately dropped in favour of dedicated rapid-transit trains. The use of standard-gauge tracks on the [[Scarborough RT]] makes it impossible for there to be any track connection between it and the other lines, and so when its ICTS vehicles need anything more than basic service (which can be carried out in the RT's own McCowan Yard), they are carried by truck to the Greenwood subway yards.

==Vehicles==
The Toronto Transit Commission has a fleet of:
* 684* subway cars for the Yonge-University-Spadina, Bloor-Danforth, and Sheppard lines
* 56 subway work cars
* 28 [[Intermediate Capacity Transit System]] cars for the Scarborough RT line
* 6 RT work cars
* 372 accessible subway cars (2005)

Here is a list of rapid transit vehicles used by the TTC since 1954:

====Future====
For their future fleet, the TTC are considering abandoning their strategy of building their trains from married pairs of identical cars, and purchasing permanent six-segment articulated units similar to the model of Bombardier's ''Movia'' metro train used by the [[Shenzhen Metro]]. These will have only two driver cabins per train, allow passengers to walk between cars  to provide increased capacity, reduce noise, and simplify operations. The original plan was to make all seats unpadded, plastic benches that would be parallel to the outside wall; due to the bad reaction from the public on this proposed change, this idea has since been scrapped, and the seats in the new trains will be almost identical to those of the T1 trains. Accessible seats will be doubled in the new cars, allowing for 12 locations per train for special needs commuters. Construction would be welded rather than riveted to reduce building costs and increase aerodynamics. The new design would be introduced around 2009 [http://www.globetechnology.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20060131.gtgridlock30/BNStory/Technology/]. Here is a walk through of the new designs released by Bombardier [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80AZEgw4vCo].

==== The T35A08 ====

"T35A08" is the public codename for the new rolling stock. The final name will be chosen by a contest.

Beginning [[June 6]], [[2006]], the TTC began displaying a mock-up of the new T35A08 train at various stations.  It ended on [[July 21]], [[2006]].
