The purpose of Weedle in the games, anime, and manga, as with all other Pok<U+00E9>mon, is to battle both wild Pok<U+00E9>mon&mdash;untamed creatures encountered while the player passes through various environments&mdash;and tamed Pok<U+00E9>mon owned by [[Pok<U+00E9>mon trainer]]s.<ref name=ign> [http://uk.gameboy.ign.com/articles/389/389660p1.html ''Pok<U+00E9>mon Ruby'' and ''Pok<U+00E9>mon Sapphire'' Review (page 1)] ''Ign.com''.

The name ''Weedle'' is probably a [[portmanteau]] of ''[[worm]]'' or ''[[weevil]]'', and ''needle''. The Japanese name ''Beedle'' is a portmanteau of the English words ''bee'' and ''needle''. The name ''Weedle'' refers to both the species as a whole, as well as individual specimens in the games, anime and manga. Weedle is a dual [[Pok<U+00E9>mon types#Bug-type|Bug]]/[[Pok<U+00E9>mon types#Poison-type|Poison]]-[[Pok<U+00E9>mon types|type]] Pok<U+00E9>mon resembling a golden-brown [[caterpillar]]. It evoles into a [[Kakuna]], then into a [[Beedrill]]. In all versions, Weedle has a large stinger on the top of its head, as well as a pinkish nose. The [[Pok<U+00E9>mon Ruby and Sapphire|Advanced Generation]] drawing and sprite design of Weedle was created by [[Ken Sugimori]]<U+2019>s team for ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon FireRed]]''<U+2019>s 2003 release on the ''[[Nintendo Game Boy Advance]]''.<ref> [http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00028S9OY/qid%3D1144936476/202-2618923-9566234 ''Pok<U+00E9>mon FireRed'' information] ''Amazon.com''.

==Biological characteristics==
Commonly spotted in the forests and grasslands, eating leaves, it is well-protected from predators by a sharp two-inch barb on its head which secretes a strong poison, and another stinger on its rear. Sniffing with its big red [[proboscis]], Weedle uses its extremely acute sense of smell to find the types of leaves it likes, avoiding those it dislikes. Shiny Weedle are a greenish-yellow. Weedle evolve into Kakuna, and then Beedrill.<ref>In-game [[Pok<U+00E9>dex]]es of the games ([http://www.pokemondungeon.com/pokedex/weedle.shtml A copy of them from ''Pok<U+00E9>mondungeon.com''.]) URL Accessed [[October 1]], [[2006]].</ref>

==In the ''Pok<U+00E9>mon'' video games==
Weedle can be caught in [[Kanto (Pok<U+00E9>mon)|Kanto]] and [[Johto]], and is often one of the first Pok<U+00E9>mon a trainer encounters in the wild in various games which take place there, such as the originals, [[Pok<U+00E9>mon Red and Blue|''Pok<U+00E9>mon Red'' and ''Blue'']], and their enhanced remakes, [[Pok<U+00E9>mon FireRed and LeafGreen|''FireRed'' and ''LeafGreen'']]; however, it cannot be caught in ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon Yellow]]''. Before the protagonist can enter [[List of Kanto locations#Viridian Forest|Viridian Forest]], an elderly man demonstrates Pok<U+00E9>mon catching technique (albeit without properly weakening the Pok<U+00E9>mon first) by capturing a Weedle.

Weedle are often caught by [[Pok<U+00E9>mon trainer|trainer]]s beginning their Pok<U+00E9>mon journey. Although Weedle are quite weak and only know Poison Sting and String Shot (making Weedle the only existing Pokemon that can't learn any Normal-type moves), they quickly [[Pok<U+00E9>mon evolution|evolve]] into [[Kakuna]] and then into [[Beedrill]], which are fast, powerful physical attackers.

Bug types like Caterpie were originally susceptible to Poison attacks. This gave Weedle the upper hand against Caterpie, and, combined with Beedrill's speed, gave Beedrill a slight advantage in confrontations with [[Butterfree]], until the Poison weakness of the Bug type was removed in the second [[Pok<U+00E9>mon#Generations|generation]] of games. However, since Butterfree can learn [[Pok<U+00E9>mon types#Psychic-type|Psychic]] and [[Pok<U+00E9>mon types#Flying-type|Flying]]-type attacks, it now has a distinct edge when facing combination Poison- and Bug-types such as Beedrill.

==In the ''Pok<U+00E9>mon'' anime==
The [[Pok<U+00E9>mon (anime)|''Pok<U+00E9>mon'' anime]] [[Television program|series]] and [[film]]s are a meta-series of adventures separate from the [[canon (fiction)|canon]] that most of the ''Pok<U+00E9>mon'' video games follow (with the exception of ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon Yellow]]'', a game based on the anime storyline).  The anime follows the quest of the main character, [[Ash Ketchum]]<ref name=ash> [http://www.psypokes.com/anime/index.php ''Pok<U+00E9>mon'' anime overview] ''Psypokes.com''. URL Accessed [[May 25]], [[2006]].</ref><U+2014>an in-training Pok<U+00E9>mon Master<U+2014>as he, (as well as several other companions<ref name=ash/>), travel around the fictitious world of Pok<U+00E9>mon along with their Pok<U+00E9>mon partners, Pikachu and Blaziken.<ref name=may> [http://serebii.net/anime/characters/may.shtml ''Pok<U+00E9>mon'' anime; May character bio] ''Serebii.net''. URL Accessed [[May 25]], [[2006]].</ref>

A Weedle first appeared in the Episode 04, "Challenge of the Samurai", in which Ash and [[Misty (Pok<U+00E9>mon)|Misty]] were travelling through the Viridian Forest. The pair came across a wild Weedle, and weakened it in attempting to capture. However, before he could throw the [[Pok<U+00E9> Ball]], Ash was distracted a young [[Pok<U+00E9>mon trainer|trainer]], called Samurai, which gave the wild Pok<U+00E9>mon time to flee, in turn, guiding its family of [[Beedrill]] to attack the group.<ref name="samurai" />

Another Weedle appeared in Episode 163, "The Bug Stops Here", during the [[Johto]] Bug-catching Contest, outside [[List of Johto locations#Goldenrod City|Goldenrod City]]. Ash and Pikachu spotted a wild Weedle, but Casey, a minor recurriting character who supports the fictitious [[baseball]] team, The ''Electabuzz'' team, used her [[Chikorita]] to capture it. Ash later won the contest, with a Beedrill, but gave her the Pok<U+00E9>mon because of her love for Yellow striped Pok<U+00E9>mon.<ref>[http://www.serebii.net/anime/epiguide/johto/163.shtml Synopsis of ''Pok<U+00E9>mon'' anime; Episode 163, "The Bug Stops Here"] ''Serebii.net''. URL accessed on [[April 13]],[[2006]].</ref>

In the very first episode of [[Pok<U+00E9>mon: Diamond and Pearl series|Pok<U+00E9>mon: Diamond and Pearl]], Weedle makes a short cameo being caught in the same web as [[Piplup]].

Dawn's Piplup disguises as a Weedle in "It's Love! Pokemon Transformation Convention!" It is a bad impression (Piplup wears a Weedle mask with the body trailing behind its head, giving away Piplup's entire lower body) and she doesn't make it to the finals.

==In other media==
A Weedle appeared in Chapter 39, "Just A Spearow Carrier", of ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon Adventures]]'', a manga series based on the Japanese versions of the video games, owned by the female [[List of Kanto locations#Pallet Town|Pallet Town]] [[Pok<U+00E9>mon Trainer|trainer]], [[Green (Pok<U+00E9>mon)|Green]]. While at the [[Pok<U+00E9>mon League]], [[Red]], the first main character based on the protagonist of the [[Pok<U+00E9>mon Red and Blue|original games]], saw Green attempting to trade her Weedle for a [[Butterfree]], belong to a minor recurring character Fisherman Wilton. However Red stopped the trade, informing Wilton that the trade was unfair, much to Green's annoyance.<ref> Kusaka, Hidenori, & Mato.

The ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon (card game)|Pok<U+00E9>mon Trading Card Game]]'' is a [[collectible card game]] similar in goal to a Pok<U+00E9>mon battle in the video game series; players must use cards (with individual strengths and weaknesses) in an attempt to defeat their opponent by "knocking out" all of his cards.<ref> [http://www.pokemon-tcg.com/p_strategy/rulebooks/book_68.jsp#433 ''Pok<U+00E9>mon Trading Card Game'' "How to play" guide] ''Pokemon-tcg.com''.
