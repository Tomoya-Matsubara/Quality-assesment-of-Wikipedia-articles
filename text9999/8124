'''Intelligent design''' is the proposition that "certain features of the [[universe]] and of [[life|living things]] are best explained by an [[intelligent]] [[causality|cause]], not an undirected process such as [[natural selection]]."<!--This quotation is from the principal advocates of intelligent design.

In ''[[Kitzmiller v.

[[United States district court|U.S. District Judge]] [[John E.

==History==
===Origin of the concept===
{{see|Argument from poor design|Teleological argument|Watchmaker analogy}}
[[File:Socrates Louvre.jpg|right|thumb|160px|A first-century bust of [[Socrates]]. The idea of intelligent design, or the argument from design, is an ancient one, held in some form by Socrates, [[Plato]], and [[Aristotle]].]]
Whether the complexity of nature indicates purposeful design has been the subject of debate since [[ancient Greek philosophy|the Greeks]]. In the 4th century BCE, [[Plato]] posited a good and wise "[[demiurge]]" as the creator and first cause of the cosmos in his ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]].''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/plato-timaeus/|title=Plato's Timaeus|accessdate=2007-07-22|date=October 25, 2005|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=The Metaphysics Research Lab, [[Stanford University]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/timaeus.html|title=Timaeus|accessdate=2007-07-22|last=Plato|authorlink=Plato|work=Internet Classics Archive|publisher=classics.mit.edu}}</ref> In his ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', [[Aristotle]] developed the idea of an "[[Unmoved Mover]]".<ref>Aristotle, ''Metaphysics'' Bk. 12</ref> In ''[[De Natura Deorum]]'' (''On the Nature of the Gods'', 45 BCE) [[Cicero]] wrote that "the divine power is to be found in a principle of reason which pervades the whole of nature."<ref>Linda Trinkaus Zagzebski (2006). ''The Philosophy of Religion: An Historical Introduction'', 31; Cicero, ''De Natura Deorum'', Book I, 36<U+2013>37, [http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/cicero/nd.shtml Latin Library].</ref> This line of reasoning has come to be known as the teleological argument for the existence of God. Some well-known forms of it were expressed in the 13th century by [[Thomas Aquinas]] and in the 19th century by [[William Paley]]. Aquinas, in his ''[[Summa Theologica|Summa Theologiae]]'', used the concept of design in his "fifth proof" for God's existence.<ref>Thomas Aquinas, ''[[Summa Theologica|Summa Theologiae]]'' "[http://web.archive.org/web/20070926220422/http://www.faithnet.org.uk/AS+Subjects/Philosophyofreligion/fiveways.htm Thomas Aquinas' 'Five Ways'] ([http://web.archive.org/web/20070808152431/http://www.faithnet.org.uk/AS+Subjects/Philosophyofreligion/fiveways.htm archive link])" in ''faithnet.org.uk''.</ref>

In the early 19th century, Paley's argument from design in ''[[Natural Theology (Paley)|Natural Theology]]'' (1802), used the [[watchmaker analogy]],<ref>[[William Paley]], ''[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=A142&viewtype=text&pageseq=1 Natural Theology: or, Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity]'', 1809, London, Twelfth Edition.</ref> and such arguments led to the development of what was called [[natural theology]], the study of nature as way of understanding "the mind of God". This movement fueled the passion for collecting fossils and other biological specimens, which ultimately led to [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' (1859). Similar reasoning postulating a divine designer is embraced today by many believers in [[theistic evolution]], who consider modern science and the theory of [[evolution]] to be compatible with the concept of a supernatural designer. In correspondence about the question with [[Asa Gray]], Darwin wrote that "I cannot honestly go as far as you do about Design. I am conscious that I am in an utterly hopeless muddle.

===Development of its modern form===
Intelligent design in the late 20th and early 21st century is a development of [[natural theology]] that seeks to change the basis of science and undermine evolutionary theory.<ref>See, e.g., the publisher's editorial description of the 2006 paperback printing of [[William Paley]] (1803) ''Natural Theology" : "William Paley's classic brings depth to the history of intelligent design arguments. The contrivance of the eye, the ear, and numerous other anatomical features throughout the natural world are presented as arguments for God's presence and concern. While there are distinctive differences between Paley's argument and those used today by intelligent design theorists and creationists, it remains a fascinating glimpse of the nineteenth-century's debate over the roles of religion and science".
*David C. Steinmetz (2005) "The Debate on Intelligent Design" in ''The Christian Century'', (December 27, 2005, pp. 27<U+2013>31.) 
*Leading intelligent design proponent [[William Dembski]] (2001) argues the opposing view in [http://www.designinference.com/documents/2001.03.ID_as_nat_theol.htm Is Intelligent Design a form of natural theology?]</ref> As evolutionary theory expanded to explain more phenomena, the examples held up as evidence of design changed, though the essential argument remains the same: complex systems imply a designer. Past examples have included the eye and the feathered wing; current examples are typically [[biochemical]]: protein functions, [[blood clotting]], and bacterial [[flagella]]; see [[irreducible complexity]].

Philosopher [[Barbara Forrest]] writes that the intelligent design movement began in 1984 with the publication by Jon A. Buell's the [[Foundation for Thought and Ethics]] of ''The Mystery of Life's Origin'' by [[Charles B. Thaxton]], a chemist and creationist. Thaxton held a conference in 1988, "Sources of Information Content in DNA," which attracted creationists such as [[Stephen C. Meyer]]. Forrest writes that, in December 1988, Thaxton decided to use the term "intelligent design," instead of creationism, for the movement.<ref>Forrest, Barbara. [http://www.dailykos.com/story/2006/3/11/8448/52824 Know Your Creationists: Know Your Allies]</ref> 

In March 1986  a review by Meyer used information theory to suggest that messages transmitted by DNA in the cell show "specified complexity" specified by intelligence, and must have originated with an intelligent agent.<ref name=meyermolo>{{cite web|url=http://www.arn.org/docs/meyer/sm_notalone.htm|title=We Are Not Alone|accessdate=2007-10-10|author=Stephen C.

==Integral concepts==
===Irreducible complexity===
{{see|Irreducible complexity}}
[[Image:MichaelBehe.jpg|thumbnail|right|The concept of irreducible complexity was popularised by [[Michael Behe]], in his 1996 book, ''[[Darwin's Black Box]]''.]]
The term "irreducible complexity" was introduced by biochemist [[Michael Behe]] in his 1996 book ''[[Darwin's Black Box]]'', though he had already described the concept in his contributions to the 1993 revised edition of ''Of Pandas and People''.<ref name=pandafounds/> Behe defines it as "a single system which is composed of several well-matched interacting parts that contribute to the basic function, wherein the removal of any one of the parts causes the system to effectively cease functioning".<ref>Behe, Michael (1997): ''Molecular Machines: Experimental Support for the Design Inference'' [http://www.apologetics.org/MolecularMachines/tabid/99/Default.aspx]</ref>

Behe uses the analogy of a mousetrap to illustrate this concept. A mousetrap consists of several interacting pieces<U+2014>the base, the catch, the spring and the hammer<U+2014>all of which must be in place for the mousetrap to work. Removal of any one piece destroys the function of the mousetrap. Intelligent design advocates assert that natural selection could not create irreducibly complex systems, because the selectable function is present only when all parts are assembled. Behe argued that irreducibly complex biological mechanisms include the bacterial flagellum of ''[[E. coli]]'', the blood clotting cascade, [[cilia]], and the adaptive [[immune system]].<ref>Irreducible complexity of these examples is disputed; see Kitzmiller, pp. 76<U+2013>78, and [http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2006/01/ken_miller_webc.html Ken Miller Webcast]</ref><ref>The Collapse of "Irreducible Complexity" Kenneth R. Miller Brown University [http://www.millerandlevine.com/km/evol/design2/article.html]</ref>

Critics point out that the irreducible complexity argument assumes that the necessary parts of a system have always been necessary and therefore could not have been added sequentially.<ref>John H. McDonald's "[http://udel.edu/~mcdonald/mousetrap.html reducibly complex mousetrap]"</ref><ref>David Ussery, "[http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/staff/dave/Behe.html A Biochemist's Response to 'The Biochemical Challenge to Evolution']"</ref> They argue that something which is at first merely advantageous can later become necessary as other components change. Furthermore, they argue, evolution often proceeds by altering preexisting parts or by removing them from a system, rather than by adding them. This is sometimes called the "scaffolding objection" by an analogy with scaffolding, which can support an "irreducibly complex" building until it is complete and able to stand on its own.<ref>For example, [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/312/5770/97 Bridgham ''et al.''] showed that gradual evolutionary mechanisms can produce complex protein-protein interaction systems from simpler precursors. {{cite journal|author=Bridgham ''et al.''|year=2006|title=Evolution of Hormone-Receptor Complexity by Molecular Exploitation|journal=Science|volume=312|issue=5770|pages=97<U+2013>101|doi=10.1126/science.1123348|pmid=16601189|last2=Carroll|first2=SM|last3=Thornton|first3=JW}}</ref>
Behe has acknowledged using "sloppy prose", and that his "argument against Darwinism does not add up to a logical proof".<ref>{{cite news|last=Orr|first=H. Allen|title=Devolution|publisher=[[The New Yorker]]|date=May 30, 2005|url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/05/30/050530fa_fact}} This article draws from the following exchange of letters in which Behe admits to sloppy prose and non-logical proof: {{cite web|last=Behe|first=M.|coauthors=Dembski, Wells, Nelson, Berlinski|title=Has Darwin met his match? Letters<U+2014>An exchange over ID|publisher=[[Discovery Institute]]|date=March 26, 2003|url=http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?program=CRSC%20Responses&command=view&amp;id=1406|accessdate=2006-11-30}}</ref> Irreducible complexity has remained a popular argument among advocates of intelligent design; in the [[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District|Dover trial]], the court held that "Professor Behe's claim for irreducible complexity has been refuted in peer-reviewed research papers and has been rejected by the scientific community at large".<ref>{{cite court|litigants=Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District|vol=04|reporter=cv|opinion=2688|date=December 20, 2005}}, [[s:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District/4:Whether ID Is Science#4. Whether ID is Science|p. 64]].</ref>

===Specified complexity===
{{see|Specified complexity}}
In 1986 the creationist chemist [[Charles Thaxton]] used the term "specified complexity" from [[information theory]] when claiming that messages transmitted by DNA in the cell were specified by intelligence, and must have originated with an intelligent agent.<ref name=meyermolo/>
The intelligent design concept of "specified complexity" was developed in the 1990s by mathematician, philosopher, and theologian [[William Dembski]]. Dembski states that when something exhibits specified complexity (i.e., is both complex and "specified", simultaneously), one can infer that it was produced by an intelligent cause (i.e., that it was designed) rather than being the result of natural processes. He provides the following examples: "A single letter of the alphabet is specified without being complex. A long sentence of random letters is complex without being specified. A [[Shakespearean]] [[sonnet]] is both complex and specified".<ref>Dembski. Intelligent Design, p. 47</ref> He states that details of living things can be similarly characterized, especially the "patterns" of molecular sequences in functional biological molecules such as [[DNA]].

[[Image:Dembski head shot.jpg|thumbnail|left|140px|[[William Dembski]] proposed the concept of [[specified complexity]].<ref>William Dembski, Photo by Wesley R. Elsberry, taken at lecture given at University of California at Berkeley, 2006/03/17.</ref>]]
Dembski defines [[complex specified information]] (CSI) as anything with a less than 1 in 10<sup>150</sup> chance of occurring by (natural) chance. Critics say that this renders the argument a [[Tautology (rhetoric)|tautology]]: complex specified information cannot occur naturally because Dembski has defined it thus, so the real question becomes whether or not CSI actually exists in nature.<ref>

===Fine-tuned Universe===
{{see|Fine-tuned Universe}}
Intelligent design proponents have also occasionally appealed to broader teleological arguments outside of biology, most notably an argument based on the [[Fine-tuned universe|fine-tuning of universal constants]] that make matter and life possible and which are argued not to be solely attributable to chance. These include the values of [[fundamental physical constants]], the relative strength of [[nuclear force]]s, [[electromagnetism]], and [[gravity]] between [[fundamental particles]], as well as the ratios of masses of such particles. Intelligent design proponent and [[Center for Science and Culture]] fellow [[Guillermo Gonzalez (astronomer)|Guillermo Gonzalez]] argues that if any of these values were even slightly different, the universe would be dramatically different, making it impossible for many [[chemical elements]] and features of the [[Universe]], such as [[galaxies]], to form.<ref>

Scientists have generally responded that this argument cannot be tested and is therefore not science but metaphysics. Some scientists argue that even when taken as mere speculation, these arguments are poorly supported by existing evidence.<ref>The Panda's Thumb.

===Intelligent designer===
{{see|Intelligent designer}}

Intelligent design arguments are formulated in secular terms and intentionally avoid identifying the intelligent agent (or agents) they posit. Although they do not state that God is the designer, the designer is often implicitly hypothesized to have intervened in a way that only a god could intervene. Dembski, in ''[[The Design Inference]]'', speculates that an alien culture could fulfill these requirements. The authoritative description of intelligent design,<ref>

|title=Questions About Intelligent Design

Beyond the debate over whether intelligent design is scientific, a number of critics argue that existing evidence makes the design hypothesis appear unlikely, irrespective of its status in the world of science. For example, [[Jerry Coyne]] asks why a designer would "give us a pathway for making [[vitamin C]], but then destroy it by disabling one of its enzymes" (see [[pseudogene]]) and why he or she would not "stock oceanic islands with reptiles, mammals, amphibians, and freshwater fish, despite the suitability of such islands for these species". Coyne also points to the fact that "the flora and fauna on those islands resemble that of the nearest mainland, even when the environments are very different" as evidence that species were not placed there by a designer.<ref name="CoyneTNR">

Odd designs could, for example, "have been placed there by the designer ... for artistic reasons, to show off, for some as-yet undetectable practical purpose, or for some unguessable reason". Coyne responds that in light of the evidence, "either life resulted not from intelligent design, but from evolution; or the intelligent designer is a cosmic prankster who designed everything to make it look as though it had evolved".<ref name="CoyneTNR"/>

As symptoms, those consequences are certainly worth treating. However, we are convinced that in order to defeat materialism, we must cut it off at its source. That source is scientific materialism. This is precisely our strategy. If we view the predominant materialistic science as a giant tree, our strategy is intended to function as a 'wedge' that, while relatively small, can split the trunk when applied at its weakest points. The very beginning of this strategy, the 'thin edge of the wedge,' was Phillip Johnson's critique of Darwinism begun in 1991 in Darwinism on Trial, and continued in Reason in the Balance and Defeating Darwinism by Opening Minds. Michael Behe's highly successful Darwin's Black Box followed Johnson's work. We are building on this momentum, broadening the wedge with a positive scientific alternative to materialistic scientific theories, which has come to be called the theory of intelligent design (ID). Design theory promises to reverse the stifling dominance of the materialist worldview, and to replace it with a science consonant with Christian and theistic convictions".''

Dover Area School District]]'' trial transcript, Day 6 (October 5) ''"What I am talking about is the essence of intelligent design, and the essence of it is theistic realism as defined by Professor Johnson. Now that stands on its own quite apart from what their motives are. I'm also talking about the definition of intelligent design by Dr. Dembski as the Logos theology of John's Gospel. That stands on its own. [...] Intelligent design, as it is understood by the proponents that we are discussing today, does involve a supernatural creator, and that is my objection. And I am objecting to it as they have defined it, as Professor Johnson has defined intelligent design, and as Dr. Dembski has defined intelligent design. And both of those are basically religious. They involve the supernatural".''</ref> She writes that the leading proponents of intelligent design are closely allied with the ultra-conservative [[Christian Reconstructionism]] movement. She lists connections of (current and former) Discovery Institute Fellows Phillip Johnson, Charles Thaxton, Michael Behe, [[Richard Weikart]], Jonathan Wells and [[Francis Beckwith]] to leading Christian Reconstructionist organizations, and the extent of the funding provided the Institute by [[Howard Ahmanson Jr.]], a leading figure in the Reconstructionist movement.<ref>

===Reaction from other creationist groups===
Not all creationist organizations have embraced the intelligent design movement. [[Hugh Ross (creationist)|Hugh Ross]] of Reasons to Believe, a proponent of [[Old Earth creationism]], believes that the efforts of intelligent design proponents to divorce the concept from Biblical Christianity make its hypothesis too vague. In 2002 he wrote: "Winning the argument for design without identifying the designer yields, at best, a sketchy origins model. Such a model makes little if any positive impact on the community of scientists and other scholars<U+2026> The time is right for a direct approach, a single leap into the origins fray. Introducing a biblically based, scientifically verifiable creation model represents such a leap."<ref>

Likewise, two of the most prominent [[Young Earth creationism]] organizations in the world have attempted to distinguish their views from intelligent design. Henry M. Morris of the [[Institute for Creation Research]] (ICR) wrote, in 1999, that ID, "even if well-meaning and effectively articulated, will not work! It has often been tried in the past and has failed, and it will fail today. The reason it won't work is because it is not the Biblical method.<U+201D> According to Morris: <U+201C>The evidence of intelligent design<U+2026> must be either followed by or accompanied by a sound presentation of true Biblical creationism if it is to be meaningful and lasting."<ref>

===Polls===
Several surveys were conducted prior to the December 2005 decision in ''Kitzmiller v. Dover'', which sought to determine the level of support for intelligent design among certain groups. According to a 2005 [[Harris Interactive|Harris poll]], 10% of adults in the United States viewed human beings as "so complex that they required a powerful force or intelligent being to help create them".<ref>

A May 2005 survey of nearly 1500 physicians in the United States conducted by the Louis Finkelstein Institute and HCD Research showed that 63% of the physicians agreed more with evolution than with intelligent design.<ref name=Findelsteinpollreport>According to the poll, 18% of the physicians believed that God created humans exactly as they appear today. Another 42% believed that God initiated and guided an evolutionary process that has led to current human beings. The poll also found that "an overwhelming majority of Jewish doctors (83%) and half of Catholic doctors (51%) believe that intelligent design is simply "a religiously inspired pseudo-science rather than a legitimate scientific speculation". The poll also found that "more than half of Protestant doctors (63%) believe that intelligent design is a "legitimate scientific speculation".<br/>

A series of Gallup polls in the United States from 1982 through 2008 on "Evolution, Creationism, Intelligent Design" found support for "human beings have developed over millions of years from less advanced formed of life, but God guided the process" of between 35% and 40%, support for "God created human beings in pretty much their present form at one time within the last 10,000 years or so"  varied from 43% to 47%, and support for "human beings have developed over millions of years from less advanced formed of life, but God had no part in the process" varied from 9% to 14%. The polls also noted answers to a series of more detailed questions.<ref>Gallup, [http://www.gallup.com/poll/21814/evolution-creationism-intelligent-design.aspx "Evolution, creationism, intelligent design,"].

===Film===
The film ''[[Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed]]'' sparked further controversy in 2008. This documentary, hosted by [[Ben Stein]], spends much time focusing on professors who have been asked to leave or have left numerous institutions because, the film insinuates, of their beliefs in Intelligent Design. One of the film's first screenings resulted in [[PZ Myers|Paul "PZ" Myers]], an interviewee in the film, being asked to leave the theater. There have also been allegations from some interviewees that interviews were recorded many times in order to get the exact phrasing required by the producer. The production company, Premise Media, also has helped finance some religious films such as ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]''.

Advocates of intelligent design seek to keep God and the Bible out of the discussion, and present intelligent design in the language of science as a scientific hypothesis.<ref name="IDstatementOnCreator"/><ref name="Johnson-Touchstone"/> However, among a very significant proportion of the general public in the United States the major concern is whether conventional evolutionary biology is compatible with belief in God and in the Bible, and how this issue is taught in schools.<ref name="Time-15-Aug-2005"/> The public controversy was given widespread media coverage in the United States, particularly during the ''Kitzmiller v. Dover'' trial in late 2005 and after President [[George W. Bush]] expressed support for the idea of teaching intelligent design alongside evolution in August 2005. In response to Bush<U+2019>s statement and the pending federal trial, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine ran an eight-page cover story on the Evolution Wars in which they examined the issue of teaching intelligent design in the classroom.<ref name=TIME>{{cite web

Intelligent design proponents cannot legitimately ''infer'' that an intelligent designer is behind the part of the process that is not understood scientifically, since they have not shown that anything supernatural has occurred. The inference that an intelligent designer created life on Earth, which advocate William Dembski has said could alternately be an "alien" life force,<ref name="Design Inference"/> has been compared to the ''[[A priori and a posteriori (philosophy)|a priori]]'' claim that aliens helped the ancient Egyptians build the pyramids.<ref>

Rabbi [[Natan Slifkin]] directly criticized the advocates of intelligent design as presenting a perspective of God that is dangerous to religion.<ref name=Slifkin>Natan Slifkin (2006). ''The Challenge of Creation'' (New York: Yashar Books) 288 ff.</ref> Those who promote it as parallel to religion, he asserts, do not truly understand it. Slifkin criticizes intelligent design's advocacy of teaching their perspective in biology classes, wondering why no one claims that God's hand should be taught in other secular classes, such as history, physics or geology. Slifkin also asserts that the intelligent design movement is inordinately concerned with portraying God as "in control" when it comes to things that cannot be easily explained by science, but not in control in respect to things which ''can'' be explained by scientific theory.<ref name=Slifkin/> Kenneth Miller expressed a view similar to Slifkin's: "[T]he struggles of the Intelligent Design movement are best understood as clamorous and disappointing double failures - rejected by science because they do not fit the facts, and having failed religion because they think too little of God.<ref>

===Defining science===
The [[scientific method]] is a body of techniques for investigating [[phenomenon|phenomena]] and acquiring new [[knowledge]] of the [[natural world]] without assuming the existence or nonexistence of the supernatural, an approach sometimes called [[naturalism (philosophy)|methodological naturalism]]. Intelligent design proponents believe that this can be equated to [[materialism|materialist]] [[metaphysical naturalism]], and have often said that not only is their own position scientific, but it is even more scientific than evolution, and that they want a redefinition of science as a revived [[natural theology]] or [[natural philosophy]] to allow "non-naturalistic theories such as intelligent design".<ref>

Critics also say that the intelligent design doctrine does not meet the [[Daubert Standard]],<ref>

}}</ref> the criteria for [[scientific evidence]] mandated by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|US Supreme Court]]. The Daubert Standard governs which evidence can be considered scientific in United States federal courts and most state courts. Its four criteria are:
*The theoretical underpinnings of the methods must yield testable predictions by means of which the theory could be falsified.
*The methods should preferably be published in a [[peer review|peer-reviewed]] journal.
*There should be a known rate of [[error]] that can be used in evaluating the results.
*The methods should be generally accepted within the relevant scientific community.
In ''[[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]]'', using these criteria and others mentioned above, Judge Jones [[s:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District/6:Curriculum, Conclusion|ruled that]] "... we have addressed the seminal question of whether ID is science. We have concluded that it is not, and moreover that ID cannot uncouple itself from its creationist, and thus religious, antecedents".

Against this, the philosopher [[Thomas Nagel]] argues that intelligent design is very different from [[creation science]], in that it does not depend on distortion of evidence, or on the assumption that it is immune to empirical evidence. It depends only on the idea that the hypothesis of a designer makes sense. Whatever the merits of the positions, he argues that it is a scientific disagreement, not a disagreement between science and something else.<ref name=Nagel192>Nagel, Thomas.

He noted that scientists such as [[Joan Roughgarden]] and [[Lynn Margulis]] have challenged certain Darwinist theories and offered explanations of their own and despite this they "have not been persecuted, shunned, fired or even expelled. Why? Because they are doing science, not religion."<ref>[http://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/08-04-17.html#part1 Skeptic: eSkeptic: Thursday, April 17th, 2008]</ref> The issue that supernatural explanations do not conform to the [[scientific method]] became a sticking point for intelligent design proponents in the 1990s, and is addressed in the [[wedge strategy]] as an aspect of science that must be challenged before intelligent design can be accepted by the broader scientific community.

The debate over whether intelligent design produces new research, as any scientific field must, and has legitimately attempted to publish this research, is extremely heated. Both critics and advocates point to numerous examples to make their case. For instance, the [[John Templeton Foundation|Templeton Foundation]], a former funder of the Discovery Institute and a major supporter of projects seeking to reconcile science and religion, says that it asked intelligent design proponents to submit proposals for actual research, but none were ever submitted. Charles L. Harper Jr., foundation vice-president, said: "From the point of view of rigor and intellectual seriousness, the intelligent design people don't come out very well in our world of scientific review".<ref>

===Intelligence as an observable quality===
The phrase ''intelligent'' design makes use of an assumption of the quality of an observable [[intelligence (trait)|intelligence]], a concept that has no [[scientific consensus]] definition. William Dembski, for example, has written that "Intelligence leaves behind a characteristic signature". The characteristics of intelligence are assumed by intelligent design proponents to be [[observation|observable]] without specifying what the criteria for the [[measurement]] of intelligence should be. Dembski, instead, asserts that "in special sciences ranging from [[forensics]] to [[archaeology]] to [[SETI]] (the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence), appeal to a designing intelligence is indispensable".<ref>

}}</ref> How this appeal is made and what this implies as to the definition of intelligence are topics left largely unaddressed. [[Seth Shostak]], a researcher with the [[SETI Institute]], disputed Dembski's comparison of SETI and intelligent design, saying that intelligent design advocates base their inference of design on complexity<U+2014>the argument being that some biological systems are too complex to have been made by natural processes<U+2014>while SETI researchers are looking primarily for [[Artificial creation|artificial]]ity.<ref>

Critics say that the design detection methods proposed by intelligent design proponents are radically different from conventional design detection, undermining the key elements that make it possible as legitimate science. Intelligent design proponents, they say, are proposing both searching for a designer without knowing anything about that designer's abilities, parameters, or intentions (which scientists do know when searching for the results of human intelligence), as well as denying the very distinction between natural/artificial design that allows scientists to compare complex designed artifacts against the background of the sorts of complexity found in nature.<ref>"For human artifacts, we know the designer's identity, human, and the mechanism of design, as we have experience based upon empirical evidence that humans can make such things, as well as many other attributes including the designer's abilities, needs, and desires. With ID, proponents assert that they refuse to propose hypotheses on the designer's identity, do not propose a mechanism, and the designer, he/she/it/they, has never been seen. In that vein, defense expert Professor Minnich agreed that in the case of human artifacts and objects, we know the identity and capacities of the human designer, but we do not know any of those attributes for the designer of biological life. In addition, Professor Behe agreed that for the design of human artifacts, we know the designer and its attributes and we have a baseline for human design that does not exist for design of biological systems. Professor Behe's only response to these seemingly insurmountable points of disanalogy was that the inference still works in science fiction movies".<U+2014>{{cite court

As a means of criticism, certain [[scientific skepticism|skeptics]] have pointed to a challenge of intelligent design derived from the study of [[artificial intelligence]]. The criticism is a counter to intelligent design claims about what makes a design intelligent, specifically that "no preprogrammed device can be truly intelligent, that intelligence is irreducible to natural processes".<ref>

}}http://web.archive.org/web/20011018142820/http://www.csicop.org/si/2001-03/intelligent-design.html</ref> This claim is similar in type to an assumption of [[Cartesian dualism]] that posits a strict separation between "mind" and the material [[Universe]]. However, in studies of artificial intelligence, while there is an implicit assumption that supposed "intelligence" or [[creativity]] of a [[computer program]] is determined by the capabilities given to it by the computer [[programmer]], artificial intelligence need not be bound to an inflexible system of rules. Rather, if a computer program can access [[randomness]] as a function, this effectively allows for a flexible, creative, and adaptive intelligence. [[Evolutionary algorithms]], a subfield of machine learning (itself a subfield of artificial intelligence), have been used to mathematically demonstrate that randomness and selection can be used to "evolve" complex, highly adapted structures that are not explicitly designed by a programmer. Evolutionary algorithms use the Darwinian metaphor of random mutation, selection and the survival of the fittest to solve diverse mathematical and scientific problems that are usually not solvable using conventional methods. Intelligence derived from randomness is essentially indistinguishable from the "innate" intelligence associated with biological organisms, and poses a challenge to the intelligent design conception that intelligence itself necessarily requires a designer. [[Cognitive science]] continues to investigate the nature of intelligence along these lines of inquiry. The intelligent design community, for the most part, relies on the assumption that intelligence is readily apparent as a fundamental and basic property of complex systems.<ref>

}}</ref> In the argument from ignorance, a lack of evidence for one view is erroneously argued to constitute proof of the correctness of another view. Scott and Branch say that intelligent design is an argument from ignorance because it relies on a lack of knowledge for its conclusion: lacking a natural explanation for certain specific aspects of evolution, we assume intelligent cause. They contend most scientists would reply that the unexplained is not unexplainable, and that "we don't know yet" is a more appropriate response than invoking a cause outside science.<ref name="2002-09-10"/> Particularly, [[Michael Behe]]'s demands for ever more detailed explanations of the historical evolution of molecular systems seem to assume a [[false dichotomy]], where either evolution or design is the proper explanation, and any perceived failure of evolution becomes a victory for design. Scott and Branch also contend that the supposedly novel contributions proposed by intelligent design proponents have not served as the basis for any productive scientific research.

Intelligent design has also been characterized as a "[[god of the gaps]]" argument, which has the following form:
:*There is a gap in scientific knowledge.
:*The gap is filled with acts of God (or [[intelligent designer]]) and therefore proves the existence of God (or intelligent designer).

A god-of-the-gaps argument is the [[theological]] version of an [[argument from ignorance]]. A key feature of this type of argument is that it merely answers outstanding questions with explanations (often [[supernatural]]) that are unverifiable and ultimately themselves subject to unanswerable questions.<ref>See, for instance: {{cite journal

==Kitzmiller trial==
{{main|Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District}}
''Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District'' was the first direct challenge brought in the [[United States federal courts]] against a public school district that required the presentation of intelligent design as an alternative to [[evolution]]. The plaintiffs successfully argued that intelligent design is a form of [[creationism]], and that the school board policy thus violated the [[Establishment Clause]] of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]].<ref>[http://ncse.com/creationism/legal/intelligent-design-trial-kitzmiller-v-dover Intelligent Design on Trial: Kitzmiller v. Dover]. National Center for Science Education. October 17th, 2008</ref>

Eleven parents of students in [[Dover, Pennsylvania|Dover]], [[Pennsylvania]], sued the [[Dover Area School District]] over a statement that the school board required be read aloud in ninth-grade science classes when evolution was taught. The plaintiffs were represented by the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU), [[Americans United for Separation of Church and State]] (AU) and [[Pepper Hamilton LLP]]. The [[National Center for Science Education]] (NCSE) acted as consultants for the plaintiffs. The defendants were represented by the [[Thomas More Law Center]].<ref>

[[Michael Behe]], [[Steve Fuller (social epistemologist)|Steve Fuller]] and [[Scott Minnich]] served as expert witnesses for the defense.

On December 20, 2005 Judge Jones issued his 139-page [[finding of fact|findings of fact]] and decision, [[s:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District et al.|ruling that]] the Dover mandate was unconstitutional, and barring intelligent design from being taught in Pennsylvania's Middle District public school science classrooms. The eight Dover school board members who voted for the intelligent design requirement were all defeated in a November 8, 2005 election by challengers who opposed the teaching of intelligent design in a science class, and the current school board president stated that the board does not intend to appeal the ruling.<ref>

In his finding of facts, Judge Jones made the following condemnation of the [[Teach the Controversy]] strategy:
{{quotation|Moreover, ID<U+2019>s backers have sought to avoid the scientific scrutiny which we have now determined that it cannot withstand by advocating that the controversy, but not ID itself, should be taught in science class. This tactic is at best disingenuous, and at worst a canard.}}

===Reaction===
Judge Jones himself anticipated that his ruling would be criticized, saying in his decision that:
{{quotation|Those who disagree with our holding will likely mark it as the product of an activist judge. If so, they will have erred as this is manifestly not an activist Court. Rather, this case came to us as the result of the activism of an ill-informed faction on a school board, aided by a national public interest law firm eager to find a constitutional test case on ID, who in combination drove the Board to adopt an imprudent and ultimately unconstitutional policy. The breathtaking inanity of the Board's decision is evident when considered against the factual backdrop which has now been fully revealed through this trial. The students, parents, and teachers of the Dover Area School District deserved better than to be dragged into this legal maelstrom, with its resulting utter waste of monetary and personal resources.}}

As Jones had predicted, [[John G. West]], Associate Director of the [[Center for Science and Culture]] at [[Discovery Institute]], said:
{{quotation|The Dover decision is an attempt by an activist federal judge to stop the spread of a scientific idea and even to prevent criticism of Darwinian evolution through government-imposed censorship rather than open debate, and it won't work. He has conflated Discovery Institute's position with that of the Dover school board, and he totally misrepresents intelligent design and the motivations of the scientists who research it.<ref>

In April 2010, the [[American Academy of Religion]] issued ''Guidelines for Teaching About Religion in K<U+2010>12 Public Schools in the United States'' which included guidance that [[creation science]] or intelligent design should not be taught in science classes, as "Creation science and intelligent design represent worldviews that fall outside of the realm of science that is defined as (and limited to) a method of inquiry based on gathering observable and measurable evidence subject to specific principles of reasoning." However, they, as well as other "worldviews that focus on speculation regarding the origins of life represent another important and relevant form of human inquiry that is appropriately studied in literature or social sciences courses. Such study, however, must include a diversity of worldviews representing a variety of religious and philosophical perspectives and must avoid privileging one view as more legitimate than others."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ncse.com/news/2010/07/american-academy-religion-teaching-creationism-005712 |title=American Academy of Religion on teaching creationism |date=July 23rd, 2010 |publisher=National Center for Science Education |quote= |accessdate=2010-08-09}}</ref>

In June 2007 the [[Council of Europe]]'s "Committee on Culture, Science and Education" issued a report, ''The dangers of creationism in education'', which states "Creationism in any of its forms, such as 'intelligent design', is not based on facts, does not use any scientific reasoning and its contents are pathetically inadequate for science classes."<ref name=coe_report>{{cite web|url=http://assembly.coe.int/Main.asp?link=/Documents/WorkingDocs/Doc07/EDOC11297.htm|title=The dangers of creationism in education|publisher=[[Council of Europe]]|accessdate=2007-08-03}}</ref> In describing the dangers posed to education by teaching creationism, it described intelligent design as "anti-science" and involving "blatant scientific fraud" and "intellectual deception" that "blurs the nature, objectives and limits of science" and links it and other forms of creationism to [[denialism]]. On October 4, 2007, the Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly approved a resolution stating that schools should "resist presentation of creationist ideas in any discipline other than religion", including "intelligent design" which it described as "the latest, more refined version of creationism", "presented in a more subtle way". The resolution emphasises that the aim of the report is not to question or to fight a belief, but to "warn against certain tendencies to pass off a belief as science".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ncse.com/news/2007/10/council-europe-approves-resolution-against-creationism-001200|title=NCSE Resource<U+2014>Council of Europe approves resolution against creationism|publisher=National Center for Science Education|date=October 4, 2007|accessdate=2009-11-18}}

}}</ref> As a reaction on this situation in the [[Netherlands]], in [[Belgium]] the President of the Flemish Catholic Educational Board (VSKO) Mieke Van Hecke declared that: "Catholic scientists already accepted the theory of evolution for a long time and that intelligent design and creationism doesn't belong in Flemish Catholic schools. It's not the tasks of the politics to introduce new ideas, that's task and goal of science."<ref>De Morgen, May 23, 2005</ref>

===Relation to Islam===
[[Creationism]] has strong political support in many [[Islam]]ic countries, and antievolutionary views are mainstream among academic theologians and scientists.<ref name=icash>

Similarly, some use was made of intelligent design antievolution resources. [[Muzaffar Iqbal]], a notable Muslim in Canada, signed the ''[[A Scientific Dissent From Darwinism|Scientific Dissent]]'' list of the [[Discovery Institute]].<ref>

In [[Istanbul]] in 2007, public meetings promoting intelligent design were sponsored by the local government,<ref name=icash/> and [[David Berlinski]] of the Discovery Institute was the keynote speaker at a meeting in May 2007.<ref name=SecurityWatch>

===Australia===
The status of intelligent design in Australia is somewhat similar to that in the UK (see: [[Education in Australia]]). When the former Australian Federal Education Minister, [[Brendan Nelson]], raised the notion of intelligent design being taught in science classes, the public outcry caused the minister to quickly concede that the correct forum for intelligent design, if it were to be taught, is in religious or philosophy classes.<ref>
