The '''Hebrew Bible''' ({{lang-he|<U+05EA><U+05E0>"<U+05DA>}} acronyms for {{lang|he|<U+05EA><U+05D5><U+05E8><U+05D4> <U+05E0><U+05D1><U+05D9><U+05D0><U+05D9><U+05DD> <U+05DB><U+05EA><U+05D5><U+05D1><U+05D9><U+05DD>}}) is a term referring to the books of the Jewish Bible (Tanakh) as originally written mostly in [[Biblical Hebrew]], with some [[Biblical Aramaic]]. The term closely corresponds to contents of the Jewish [[Tanakh]] and the Protestant [[Old Testament]] (see also [[Judeo-Christian]]) and does not include the [[deuterocanonical]] portions of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] or the ''{{lang|el-Latn|Anagignoskomena}}'' portions of the [[Eastern Orthodox]] Old Testaments. The term does not imply naming, numbering or ordering of books, which varies with [[Biblical canon]].

The term "Hebrew Bible" is an attempt to provide specificity with respect to contents, while avoiding allusion to any particular interpretative tradition or theological school of thought. It is widely used in academic writing and interfaith discussion in relatively neutral contexts meant to include dialogue amongst all religious traditions, but not widely in the inner discourse of the religions which use its text.

==Usage==
{{Books of the Hebrew Bible}}
''Hebrew Bible'' is a term that refers to the common/shared portions of the [[Tanakh]] (Jewish canon) and the [[Bible#Christian Bible|Christian canons]]. In its [[Latin]] form, ''[[Biblia Hebraica]]'', it traditionally serves as a title for printed editions of the [[Masoretic Text]].

Many [[scholar]]s advocate use of the term ''Hebrew Bible'' when discussing these books in academic writing, as a neutral substitute to terms with religious connotations (e.g.,  the non-neutral term "old testament").<ref>For a prominent discussion of the term's usage and the motivations for it, see [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9404E3D8153BF936A15756C0A961958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all "The New Old Testament"] by William Safire, ''New York Times'', 1997-25-5.

Hebrew Bible [and] Old Testament" without prescribing the use of either.<ref>{{cite book | title=The SBL Handbook of Style | publisher=Hendrickson Publishers | location=Peabody, Mass. | date=1999 | author=Patrick H.

Additional difficulties include:

*In terms of theology, Christianity has struggled with the [[Old Testament#Relationship between Old and New Testament|relationship between "old" and "new" testaments]] from its very beginnings.<ref name="marcion_britannica">'Marcion', in Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica, 1911.</ref><ref>For the modern debate, see [[Biblical law in Christianity]]</ref> Modern Christian formulations of this tension, sometimes building upon ancient and medieval ideas, include [[supersessionism]], [[covenant theology]], [[dispensationalism]], and [[dual covenant theology]]. However, all of these formulations, except some forms of dual-covenant theology, are objectionable to mainstream Judaism and to many Jewish scholars and writers, for whom there is only one everlasting covenant, and who therefore reject the very term "Old Testament".
*In terms of [[Development of the Christian Biblical canon|canon]], Christian usage of "Old Testament" does not refer to a universally agreed upon set of books, but rather varies depending on [[Christian denominations|denomination]].
*The term ''Old Testament'' is used exclusively to identify the Hebrew Bible as a portion of the Christian scriptures. Referring to it as the Old Testament suggests that it is a Christian work, when in fact its authorship is Jewish. Historically the Hebrew Bible was composed by the people of ancient Israel hundreds of years before Christianity existed. The Hebrew Bible's content, moreover, deals with the religion, politics, and culture of the ancient Hebrew people of Israel, and not with that of Christianity. 
*Though commonly used by Jews, the term ''[[Tanakh]]'' is derived from an [[acronym]] of the Hebrew names of the constituent parts of the Hebrew Bible, [[Torah]] ("Teaching"), [[Nevi'im]] ("Prophets"), and [[Ketuvim]] ("Writings"), and is unlikely to be appreciated by readers unfamiliar with that language and culture. It also refers to the particular arrangement of the biblical books as found in Judaism, and even to the exact features of the Masoretic Text. None of this is central to the Bible in the Christian textual tradition.

''Hebrew'' in the term ''Hebrew Bible'' refers to the original language of the books, but it may also be taken as referring to the Jews of the [[second temple]] era and the [[Diaspora]], and their descendants, who preserved the transmission of the Masoretic Text up to the present day. The Hebrew Bible includes some small portions in [[Biblical Aramaic|Aramaic]] (mostly in the books of [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]] and [[Book of Ezra|Ezra]]), which are nonetheless written and printed in the [[Hebrew alphabet]] and script, which is the same as ''Aramaic square-script''. Some [[Qumran]] Hebrew biblical manuscripts are written using the [[Paleo-Hebrew alphabet]] of the ''classical era'' of [[Solomon's Temple]]. <ref>[http://faculty.bbc.edu/ggromacki/deadseascrolls/bible.htm] DOCTRINE OF THE BIBLE</ref> The famous examples of the ''Paleo-Hebrew alphabet'' are the [[Siloam inscription]] (8th century BCE), the [[Lachish]] ostraca (6th century BCE), and the ''Bar Kokhba coin'' shown above (circa 132 CE).

According to traditional Jewish belief, the Hebrew Bible existed as an oral tradition for a long time before it was written, and it was forbidden to be documented in written form.<ref name=Himelstein>{{Cite book
