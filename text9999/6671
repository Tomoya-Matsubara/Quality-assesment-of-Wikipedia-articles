The '''Fifteenth Amendment''' ('''Amendment XV''') to the [[United States Constitution]] prohibits the federal and state governments from denying a citizen the [[suffrage|right to vote]] based on that citizen's "[[Race (classification of humans)|race]], [[Colored|color]], or previous condition of servitude". It was ratified on February 3, 1870, as the third and last of the [[Reconstruction Amendments]].

In the final years of the [[American Civil War]] and the [[Reconstruction Era]] that followed, Congress repeatedly debated the rights of the millions of black former slaves. By 1869, amendments had been passed to abolish slavery and provide citizenship and equal protection under the laws, but the narrow election of [[Ulysses S. Grant]] to the presidency in 1868 convinced a majority of Republicans that protecting the franchise of black voters was important for the party's future. After rejecting more sweeping versions of a suffrage amendment, Congress proposed a compromise amendment banning franchise restrictions on the basis of race, color, or previous servitude on February 26, 1869. The amendment survived a difficult ratification fight and was adopted on March 30, 1870.

[[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] decisions in the late nineteenth century interpreted the amendment narrowly, and by 1910, most black voters in the South faced obstacles such as [[poll tax]]es and [[literacy test]]s, from which white voters were exempted by [[grandfather clause]]s. A system of [[white primaries|whites-only primaries]] and violent reprisals by groups such as the [[Ku Klux Klan]] also [[Voter suppression|suppressed]] black participation.

In the twentieth century, the Court interpreted the amendment more broadly, striking down grandfather clauses in ''[[Guinn v. United States]]'' (1915) and dismantling the white primary system in the "Texas primary cases" (1927&ndash;1953). Along with later measures such as the [[Twenty-fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-fourth Amendment]], which forbade poll taxes in federal elections, and ''[[Harper v. Virginia State Board of Elections]]'' (1966), which forbade poll taxes in state elections, these decisions significantly increased black participation in the American political system.

=== Background ===
In the final years of the [[American Civil War]] and the [[Reconstruction Era]] that followed, Congress repeatedly debated the rights of black former slaves freed by the 1863 [[Emancipation Proclamation]] and the 1865 [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]], the latter of which had formally abolished slavery. Following the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment by Congress, however, [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]s grew concerned over the increase it would create in the congressional representation of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]-dominated Southern states. Because the full population of freed slaves would be now counted rather than the three-fifths mandated by the previous [[Three-Fifths Compromise]], the Southern states would dramatically increase their power in the population-based [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]].{{sfn|Goldstone|2011|p=22}}<ref name="Stromberg111">Stromberg, "A Plain Folk Perspective" (2002), p. 111.</ref> Republicans hoped to offset this advantage by attracting and protecting votes of the newly enfranchised black population.{{sfn|Goldstone|2011|p=22}}<ref>{{cite book |title=The Fourteenth Amendment: From Political Principle to Judicial Doctrine |last=Nelson |first=William E. |year=1988 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-04142-4 |page=47 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=VMCXjRyyKTQC&pg=PA46&dq=thirteenth+amendment+%22three+fifths%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=Bz-xUemzGMX8rAGamYDgDQ&ved=0CEQQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=thirteenth%20amendment%20%22three%20fifths%22&f=false |accessdate=June 6, 2013}}</ref><ref>Stromberg, "A Plain Folk Perspective" (2002), p. 112.</ref>

In 1865, Congress passed what would become the [[Civil Rights Act of 1866]], guaranteeing citizenship without regard to race, color, or previous condition of slavery or involuntary servitude. The bill also guaranteed equal benefits and access to the law, a direct assault on the [[Black Codes (United States)|Black Codes]] passed by many post-war Southern states. The Black Codes attempted to return ex-slaves to something like their former condition by, among other things, restricting their movement, forcing them to enter into year-long labor contracts, prohibiting them from owning firearms, and by preventing them from suing or testifying in court.{{sfn|Foner|1988|pp=199&ndash;200}} The Civil Rights Act was vetoed by President [[Andrew Johnson]], an uncompromising white supremacist.{{sfn|Goldstone|2011|pp=21&ndash;22}} Congress overrode his veto in April 1866, but the experience encouraged them to seek Constitutional guarantees of black rights, rather than relying on temporary political majorities.{{sfn|Goldstone|2011|pp=22&ndash;23}} In the same month, Congress proposed the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]], which guaranteed citizenship and equal protection under the laws regardless of race. After a bitter struggle that included attempted [[rescission]]s of ratification by two states, the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted on July 28, 1868.<ref name=Killian>{{cite book|title=The Constitution of the United States of America: Analysis and Interpretation: Analysis of Cases Decided by the Supreme Court of the United States to June 28, 2002|last=Killian|first=Johnny H. et al.|publisher=Government Printing Office|isbn=978-0-16-072379-7|page=31|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=bJjxj5gLRaEC&pg=PA31&lpg=PA31&dq=seward+July+28,+1868+promulgate&source=bl&ots=UIfbKPoYbM&sig=wrDGVZojLHm7WECJZD9ym3qXIEQ&hl=en&sa=X&ei=et3GUZ7WIITc8wTkkoDYDw&ved=0CDYQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=seward%20July%2028%2C%201868%20promulgate&f=false}}</ref>

The Fourteenth Amendment stopped short of guaranteeing the franchise to black citizens, and included language specifically acknowledging that the states could disenfranchise citizens on the basis of race.{{sfn|Foner|1988|p=255}} In the year of its ratification, only eight Northern states allowed blacks to vote.{{sfn|Foner|1988|p=448}} In the South, blacks were able to vote in many areas, but only through the intervention of the occupying [[Union Army]].{{sfn|Goldstone|2011|p=36}}

Though the [[Radical Republicans]] had advocated legal equality between whites and blacks since before the war's end,{{sfn|Foner|1988|p=178}} the party refused to include the issue in the platform at their [[1868 Republican National Convention|1868 National Convention]]. However, the party's narrow win in the [[United States presidential election, 1868|1868 presidential election]], in part due to the support of black voters, convinced many in the party that black suffrage was necessary for future electoral success.{{sfn|Foner|1988|p=448}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G2-3441200076.html |title=Fifteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution  |date=January 1, 2005 |work=Reconstruction Era Reference Library |publisher= {{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}|accessdate=June 23, 2013}}</ref>

=== Proposal ===
[[Image:The First Vote.jpg|thumb|right|190px|1867 drawing depicting African Americans casting ballots]]

Anticipating an increase in Democratic membership in the following Congress, Republicans used the [[lame duck session]] of the [[40th United States Congress]] to pass an amendment protecting black suffrage.<ref name=Framing>{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G2-3425000965.html|title=Fifteenth Amendment: Framing and ratification|author=Gillette, William|year=1986|work=Encyclopedia of the American Constitution|publisher={{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}|accessdate=June 23, 2013}}</ref> Representative [[John Bingham]], the primary author of the Fourteenth Amendment, pushed for a wide-ranging ban on suffrage limitations, but a broader proposal banning voter restriction on the basis of "race, color, nativity, property, education, or religious beliefs" was rejected.{{sfn|Foner|1988|pp=446&ndash;47}} A proposal to specifically ban [[literacy test]]s was also rejected.<ref name=Framing /> Some representatives from the North, where [[Nativism (politics)|nativism]] was a major force, wished to preserve restrictions denying the franchise to foreign-born citizens, as did representatives from the West, where [[Chinese American]]s were banned from voting.{{sfn|Foner|1988|pp=446&ndash;47}} Both Southern and Northern Republicans also wanted to continue to deny the vote to Southerners disenfranchised for support of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]], and were concerned that a sweeping endorsement of suffrage would re-enfranchise this group.{{sfn|Foner|1988|p=447}}

A House and Senate [[conference committee]] proposed the amendment's final text, which banned voter restriction only on the basis of "race, color, or previous condition of servitude".<ref name=Archives/> In order to attract the broadest possible base of support, the amendment made no mention of poll taxes or other measures to block voting, and did not guarantee the right of blacks to hold office.{{sfn|Goldstone|2011|p=37}} This compromise proposal was approved by the House on February 25, 1869 and the Senate the following day.{{sfn|Goldman|2001|p=3}}<ref name=Harp>{{cite web|url=http://15thamendment.harpweek.com/HubPages/CommentaryPage.asp?Commentary=01Timeline1869|title=Black Voting Rights: The History of the 15th Amendment|work=Harpers|accessdate=June 25, 2013|archivedate=June 25, 2013|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6HczWMLuJ|deadurl=no}}</ref>

The vote in the House was 144 to 44, with 35 not voting. The House vote was almost entirely along party lines, with no Democrats supporting the bill and only 3 Republicans voting against it.{{sfn|Gillette|1965|pp=73&ndash;74}} The final vote in the Senate was 39 to 13, with 14 not voting.{{sfn|Gillette|1965|p=75}} Some Radicals, such as Massachusetts Senator [[Charles Sumner]], abstained from voting because the amendment did not prohibit literacy tests and poll taxes.{{sfn|Gillette|1965|p=76}}

=== Ratification ===
Though many of the original proposals for the amendment had been moderated by negotiations in committee, the final draft nonetheless faced significant hurdles in being ratified by three-fourths of the states. Historian William Gillette wrote of the process, "it was hard going and the outcome was uncertain until the very end."<ref name=Framing/>

One source of opposition to the proposed amendment was the [[Women's suffrage in the United States|women's suffrage]] movement, which before and during the Civil War had made common cause with the [[abolitionist]] movement. However, with the passage of the Fourteenth Amendment, which had explicitly protected only male citizens in its second section, activists found the civil rights of women divorced from those of blacks.{{sfn|Foner|1988|p=255}} Matters came to a head with the proposal of the Fifteenth Amendment, which barred race discrimination but not gender discrimination in voter laws. After an acrimonious debate, the [[American Equal Rights Association]], the nation's leading suffragist group, split into two rival organizations: the [[National Woman Suffrage Association]] of [[Susan B. Anthony]] and [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]], who opposed the amendment, and the [[American Woman Suffrage Association]] of [[Lucy Stone]] and [[Henry Browne Blackwell]], who supported it. The two groups remained divided until the 1890s.{{sfn|Foner|1988|pp=447&ndash;48}}

Nevada was the first state to ratify the amendment, on March 1, 1869.<ref name=Harp/> The New England states and most Midwest states also ratified the amendment soon after its proposal.<ref name=Framing /> Southern states still controlled by Radical reconstruction governments, such as North Carolina, also swiftly ratified.{{sfn|Goldman|2001|p=3}} Newly elected President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] (a Republican) strongly endorsed the amendment and privately asked Nebraska's governor to call a special legislative session to speed the process, securing the state's ratification.<ref name=Framing/> In April and December 1869, Congress passed Reconstruction bills mandating that Virginia, Mississippi, Texas and Georgia ratify the amendment as a precondition to regaining congressional representation; all four states did so.<ref name=Harp/>

The struggle for ratification was particularly close in Indiana and Ohio, which voted to ratify in May 1869 and January 1870, respectively.<ref name=Framing /><ref name=Harp/> New York, which had ratified on April 14, 1869, attempted to revoke its ratification on January 5, 1870. However, in February 1870, Georgia, Iowa, Nebraska, and Texas ratified the amendment, bringing the total ratifying states to twenty-nine&mdash;one more than the required twenty-eight (three-fourths of the total states), and forestalling any court challenge as a result of New York's [[rescission]].<ref name=Harp/>{{efn|The initial twenty-nine states to ratify the amendment are as follows:

The amendment's adoption was met with widespread celebrations in black communities and abolitionist societies; many of the latter disbanded, feeling that black rights had been secured and their work was complete. President Grant said of the amendment that it "completes the greatest civil change and constitutes the most important event that has occurred since the nation came to life".<ref name=Framing/> Many Republicans felt that with the amendment's passage, black Americans no longer needed federal protection; congressman and future president [[James A. Garfield]] stated that the amendment's passage "confers upon the African race the care of its own destiny. It places their fortunes in their own hands."{{sfn|Goldstone|2011|p=37}}

== Application ==

=== Reconstruction ===
The first known black voter after the amendment's adoption was [[Thomas Mundy Peterson]], who cast his ballot on March 31, 1870 in the [[Perth Amboy, New Jersey]] mayoral election.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/15/nyregion/perth-amboy-church-is-302-and-counting.html|title=Perth Amboy church is 302 and counting|author=Ginzburg, Ralph|date=February 15, 1987|work=The New York Times|accessdate=June 25, 2013|archivedate=June 25, 2013|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6Hd3Rnt8j|deadurl=no}}</ref> 

In ''[[United States v. Reese]]'' (1876),<ref>{{ussc|92|214|1876}}</ref> the first [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] decision interpreting the Fifteenth Amendment, the Court interpreted the amendment narrowly, upholding ostensibly race-neutral limitations on suffrage including [[poll tax]]es, [[literacy test]]s, and a [[grandfather clause]] that exempted citizens from other voting requirements if their grandfathers had been registered voters, a condition only whites could generally meet.{{sfn|Johnson|2000|p=661}}{{sfn|Goldstone|2011|p=97}} The Court also stated that the amendment does not confer the right of suffrage, but it invests citizens of the United States with the right of exemption from discrimination in the exercise of the elective franchise on account of their race, color, or previous condition of servitude, and empowers Congress to enforce that right by "appropriate legislation."<ref>See ''{{ussc|92|214|1876}}''</ref> The Court wrote:

{{quote|The Fifteenth Amendment does not confer the right of suffrage upon any one. It prevents the States, or the United States, however, from giving preference, in this particular, to one citizen of the United States over another on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude. Before its adoption, this could be done. It was as much within the power of a State to exclude citizens of the United States from voting on account of race, &c., as it was on account of age, property,or education. Now it is not. If citizens of one race having certain qualifications are permitted by law to vote, those of another having the same qualifications must be. Previous to this amendment, there was no constitutional guaranty against this discrimination: now there is. It follows that the amendment has invested the citizens of the United States with a new constitutional right which is within the protecting power of Congress. That right is exemption from discrimination in the exercise of the elective franchise on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude. This, under the express provisions of the second section of the amendment, Congress may enforce by "appropriate legislation."<ref>See ''{{ussc|92|214|1876}}''</ref>}}

[[White supremacist]]s such as the [[Ku Klux Klan]] (KKK) used paramilitary violence to prevent black people from voting. A number of blacks were killed at the [[Colfax massacre]] of 1873 while attempting to defend their right to vote. The [[Enforcement Acts]] were passed by Congress in 1870<U+2013>1871 to authorize federal prosecution of the KKK and others who violated the amendment.{{sfn|Goldstone|2011|p=91}} However, as Reconstruction neared its end and federal troops withdrew, prosecutions under the Enforcement Acts dropped significantly. In ''[[United States v. Cruikshank]]'' (1876), the Supreme Court ruled that the federal government did not have the authority to prosecute the perpetrators of the Colfax massacre because they were not [[state actor]]s.<ref>{{ussc|92|542|1876}}</ref><ref name=Judicial>{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G2-3425000966.html |title=Fifteenth Amendment (Judicial Interpretation) |author=Elliott, Ward E.

=== Post-reconstruction ===
From 1890 to 1910, poll taxes and literacy tests were instituted across the South, effectively disenfranchising the great majority of blacks. [[White primaries|White-only primary elections]] also served to reduce the influence of blacks in the political system. Along with increasing legal obstacles, blacks were excluded from the political system by threats of violent reprisals by whites in the form of [[lynch mob]]s and terrorist attacks by the Ku Klux Klan.{{sfn|Johnson|2000|p=661}}

In the 20th century, the Court began to read the Fifteenth Amendment more broadly.<ref name=Judicial/> In ''[[Guinn v. United States]]'' (1915),<ref>{{ussc|238|347|1915}}</ref> a unanimous Court struck down an Oklahoma grandfather clause that effectively exempted white voters from a literacy test, finding it to be discriminatory.

Following ''Nixon'', the Democratic Party's state convention instituted a rule that only whites could vote in its primary elections; the Court unanimously upheld this rule as constitutional in ''[[Grovey v.

After judicial enforcement of the Fifteenth Amendment ended grandfather clauses, white primaries, and other discriminatory tactics, Southern black voter registration gradually increased, rising from five percent in 1940 to twenty-eight percent in 1960.<ref name=Judicial/> Although the Fifteenth Amendment was never interpreted to prohibit poll taxes, in 1962 the [[Twenty-fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-fourth Amendment]] was adopted banning poll taxes in federal elections, and in 1966 the Supreme Court ruled in ''[[Harper v. Virginia State Board of Elections]]'' (1966)<ref>{{ussc|383|663|1966}}</ref> that state poll taxes violate the Fourteenth Amendment's [[Equal Protection Clause]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G2-3425001182.html|title=Harper v.

Sections 4 and 5 of the Voting Rights Act required states and local governments with histories of racial discrimination in voting to submit all changes to their voting laws or practices to the federal government for approval before they could take affect, a process called "preclearance." The Supreme Court originally upheld these provisions as constitutional in ''[[South Carolina v. Katzenbach]]'' (1966). By 1976, sixty-three percent of Southern blacks were registered to vote, only five percent less than Southern whites.<ref name=Judicial/>

However, in ''[[Shelby County v. Holder]]'' (2013), the Supreme Court ruled that Section 4(b) of the Voting Rights Act, which established the coverage formula that determined which jurisdictions were subject to preclearance, was no longer constitutional and exceeded Congress's enforcement authority under Section 2 of the Fifteenth Amendment. The Court declared that the Fifteenth Amendment "commands that the right to vote shall not be denied or abridged on account of race or color, and it gives Congress the power to enforce that command. The Amendment is not designed to punish for the past; its purpose is to ensure a better future."<ref name="NYT20130625"/> According to the Court, "Regardless of how to look at the record no one can fairly say that it shows anything approaching the <U+2018>pervasive,<U+2019> <U+2018>flagrant, <U+2018>widespread,<U+2019> and <U+2018>rampant<U+2019> discrimination that faced Congress in 1965, and that clearly distinguished the covered jurisdictions from the rest of the nation." The preclearance provision itself was not struck down, but without a valid coverage formula, it no longer has any effect; it will continue to be inoperable unless Congress passes a new coverage formula.<ref name="NYT20130625">{{cite news|title=Between the Lines of the Voting Rights Act Opinion|author=Schwartz, John|url=http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/06/25/us/annotated-supreme-court-decision-on-voting-rights-act.html?ref=us&_r=0|newspaper=The New York Times|date=25 June 2013|accessdate=25 June 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scotusblog.com/2013/06/opinion-recap-voting-law-in-deep-peril/|title=Open recap: Voting law in deep peril|last=Lyle|first=Denniston|date=June 25, 2013|publisher=[[SCOTUSblog]]|accessdate=June 30, 2013}}</ref>
