'''Alison Krauss''' (born July 23, 1971) is an American [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]]-[[Country music|country]] singer and [[fiddle]]r. She entered the [[music of the United States|music industry]] at an early age, winning local contests by the age of ten and recording for the first time at fourteen. She signed with [[Rounder Records]] in 1985 and released her first solo album in 1987. She was invited to join the band with which she still performs, '''Alison Krauss and Union Station''' ('''AKUS'''), and later released her first album with them as a group in 1989.

She has released eleven albums, appeared on numerous [[soundtrack]]s, and helped renew interest in bluegrass music in the United States. Her soundtrack performances have led to further popularity, including the [[O Brother, Where Art Thou? (soundtrack)|''O Brother, Where Art Thou?'' soundtrack]], an album also credited with raising American interest in bluegrass, and the [[Cold Mountain (film)#Soundtrack|''Cold Mountain'' soundtrack]], which led to her performance at the [[76th Academy Awards|2004 Academy Awards]]. During her career she has won 26 [[Grammy Award]]s, making her the most awarded female artist (and the third most awarded artist overall) in Grammy history.<ref name="Grammys">{{cite news | title=Plant, Krauss rise with 'Raising Sand' at Grammys| url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/Music/02/08/grammy.night/index.html | work=CNN | first=Ted | last=Leopold | date=2009-02-09 |accessdate=2009-07-27 }}</ref>

==Biography==
Alison Krauss was born in [[Decatur, Illinois]] to parents who were originally from [[Columbus, Mississippi]]. Krauss was raised in [[Champaign, Illinois]]. She began studying [[European classical music|classical]] [[violin]] at five years of age but soon switched to bluegrass. Krauss said she first became involved with music because "[my] mother tried to find interesting things for me to do" and "wanted to get me involved in music, in addition to art and sports."<ref name="gac1">[http://www.gactv.com/gac/nw_music_beat/article/0,3034,GAC_26067_4785799_,00.html GAC interview and article] by Ronna Rubin for Great American Country June 19, 2006.

Krauss made her recording debut in 1985 on the independent album, ''Different Strokes'', featuring her brother Viktor, Swamp Weiss, and Jim Hoiles. From the age of 12 she performed with [[bass guitar|bassist]] and songwriter John Pennell in a band called "Silver Rail".{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Pennell later formed Union Station,<ref name="gacinterview">Interview with Alison Krauss and [[Dan Tyminski]] on ''GAC Nights'' for Great American Country originally broadcast on June 27, 2006.

===1989&ndash;1991: Early career===
Krauss' debut solo album was followed shortly by her first group album with Union Station in 1989  ''Two Highways''.<ref name="cmtbio">[http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/krauss_alison/bio.jhtml Alison Krauss CMT bio] for CMT.com.

Krauss' contract with Rounder required her to alternate between releasing a solo album and an album with Union Station, and she released the solo album ''I've Got That Old Feeling'' in 1990. It was her first album to rise onto the [[Billboard charts]], peaking in the top seventy-five on the [[Hot Country Songs|country chart]]. The album also was a notable point in her career as she earned her first [[Grammy Award]], the single "Steel Rails" was her first single tracked by Billboard, and the title single "I've Got That Old Feeling" was the first song for which she recorded a [[music video]]. Alison Krauss and Union Station performed at the 1989 [[Newport Folk Festival]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

''[[Now That I've Found You: A Collection]]'', a compilation of older releases and some covers of her favorite works by other artists, was released in 1995.

''New Favorite'' was followed up by the double platinum [[double album]] ''Live'' in 2002 and a release of a DVD of the same live performance in 2003. Both the album and the DVD were recorded during a performance at [[The Louisville Palace]].

''[[Lonely Runs Both Ways]]'' was released in 2004, and eventually became another Alison Krauss & Union Station gold certified album. Ron Block described ''Lonely Runs Both Ways'' as "pretty much... what we've always done" in terms of song selection and the style in which those songs were recorded.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Krauss believes the group "was probably the most unprepared we've ever been" for the album and that songs were chosen as needed rather than planned beforehand.<ref name="gac1"/> She also performed a duet with [[Brad Paisley]] on his album ''[[Mud on the Tires]]'' in the single "[[Whiskey Lullaby]]." The single was quite ranked in the top fifty of the [[Billboard Hot 100]] and the top five of the [[Hot Country Songs]], and won the [[Country Music Association Awards]] for "Best Musical Event" and "Best Music Video" of the year.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Krauss recorded a collaborative album, ''[[Raising Sand]]'' with [[Robert Plant]] in 2007 which would ultimately be RIAA certified platinum.

Krauss did not think she would make [[music video]]s at the beginning of her career, and after recording her first she was convinced it was so bad that she would never do another. Nonetheless, she has gone on to make further videos. Many of the first videos she saw were by bluegrass artists, although [[Dan Tyminski]] has noted that the [[Thriller (music video)|video for ''Thriller'']] was very popular at the time she was first exposed to music videos. She has made suggestions on the style or theme to some videos, though she tends to leave such decisions up to the [[music video director|director]] of the particular video. The group chooses directors by seeking out people who have previously directed videos bandmembers have enjoyed. The director for a video to "If I Didn't Know Any Better" from ''Lonely Runs Both Ways'', for example, was selected because Krauss enjoyed work he had done with [[Def Leppard]], and she wondered what he could do with their music. While style decisions are generally left to the various directors of the videos, many &mdash;including for "Restless", "Goodbye is All We Have", "New Favorite", and "If I Didn't Know Any Better"&mdash;follow a pattern. In all of these videos Krauss walks, sometimes interacting with other people, while the rest of the band follows her.<ref name="gacvideo"/><ref name="gacinterview"/>

===Performances===
Krauss has said she used to dislike working in the [[recording studio|studio]] where she had to play the same song repeatedly, but has come to like studio work roughly the same as [[concert|live stage performances]].

At the [[76th Academy Awards]] in February 2004, where she performed two nominated songs from the ''[[Cold Mountain (film)|Cold Mountain]]'' soundtrack, Alison Krauss was chosen by Hollywood shoe designer [[Stuart Weitzman]] to wear a pair of $2 million 'Cinderella' sandals with 4<U+00BD> inch clear glass stiletto heels and two straps adorned with 565 Kwiat diamonds set in platinum. Feeling like a rather unglamorous choice, Krauss said, "When I first heard, I was like, 'What were they thinking?' I have the worst feet of anybody who will be there that night!" In addition to the fairy-tale-inspired shoes, Weitzman outfitted Krauss with a [[Palm Tr<U+0113>o]] 600 smartphone, bejeweled with 3,000 clear-and-topaz-colored [[Swarovski]] crystals. The shoes were returned, but Krauss kept the crystal-covered phone. Weitzman chose Krauss to show off his fashions at the urging of his daughters, who are fans of Krauss' music.<ref>Lee, Lisa.
