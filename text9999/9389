'''Queenborough-in-Sheppey''' was a [[municipal borough]] in [[Kent]], [[England]] from [[1968]], to [[1974]]. [http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/unit_page.jsp?u_id=10492051]  It was created a merger of the municipal borough of [[Queenborough]], with the [[Sheerness]] urban district and [[Sheppey Rural District]], and occupied the entire [[Isle of Sheppey]].

In 1974 it was abolished under the [[Local Government Act 1972]], and the area now forms part of the [[Swale]] district.  Queenborough and various parishes in the island now have independent [[civil parish]] and town councils again.
