The '''University of Santo Tomas Faculty of Arts and Letters''', popularly known as '''UST Artlets''' or simply '''UST AB''', is the [[liberal arts college]] of the [[University of Santo Tomas]], the oldest and the largest university in the city of [[Manila]], [[Philippines]].<ref name=history>Ambeth Ocampo, Director, National Historical Institute, 2006.</ref> 

The college is one of the oldest liberal arts colleges in the country.

==History==
The [[University of Santo Tomas]] started offering courses in [[liberal arts]] and [[philosophy]] since its foundation in [[1611]]. These courses were later institutionalized with the establishment of a '''Faculty of Philosophy and Letters''' in [[1896]]. A '''College of Liberal Arts''' was also established in [[1926]]. The two colleges were merged and given the name '''Faculty of Arts and Letters''' in [[1964]].<ref name=prospectus>Official prospectus, UST Faculty of Arts and Letters, 2006.</ref>

At first, the college offered only three programs--[[Bachelor of Arts]] (A.B.), Bachelor of Literature (Litt.B.), and Bachelor of Philosophy (Ph.B.). New courses and majors gradually developed. In [[1971]], the college started offering Bachelor of Arts degree programs in Asian Studies, Behavioral Science (originally Liberal Arts-Commerce or LiA-Com), Communication Arts, Economics, Journalism, Literature, Philosophy, Political Science, Sociology, and Translation. The A.B. major in Translation was eventually phased out for lack of enrollment and funding.<ref name=prospectus>Official prospectus, UST Faculty of Arts and Letters, 2006.</ref>

In [[1994]], the college started offering the '''Bachelor of Arts major in Legal Management''', an interdisciplinary degree program in business management and law designed to suit the needs of students intending to go to law school after graduation but would like to have other career prospects as a fall-back option.<ref name=prospectus>Official prospectus, UST Faculty of Arts and Letters, 2006.</ref> 

In [[2005]], the college teamed up with the '''U.S.T. College of Education''' to offer a [[double degree]]--'''Bachelor of Arts-Bachelor of Secondary Education major in Social Sciences/Studies (AB-BSE)'''.<ref name=prospectus>Official prospectus, UST Faculty of Arts and Letters, 2006.</ref>

==Student population==
