Before being promoted to the main WWE roster, Hennigan entered ''[[WWE Tough Enough#Tough Enough III|Tough Enough III]]'', a televised competition that would award the winner a WWE contract. He was one of the winners in the competition and assigned to their developmental territory, [[Ohio Valley Wrestling]] (OVW), to continue his wrestling training. While situated at OVW, he was placed in a [[tag team]], alongside [[Adam Birch|Joey Mercury]], in which they won the [[OVW Southern Tag Team Championship]] on one occasion. It was also during this time that he and Mercury, alongside their [[Manager (professional wrestling)|manager]] [[Melina Perez|Melina]], were known as the stable [[MNM]].

After signing with WWE, the group were called up to the SmackDown! roster and on their debut in April 2005, Hennigan and Mercury went on to win the [[WWE Tag Team Championship |WWE Tag Team Championship]]. After their  third and final reign ended in May 2006, Hennigan and Melina [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Turn|turned]] on Mercury. Hennigan and Melina were let go from the SmackDown! roster and debuted on the [[WWE Raw|Raw]] brand. During his time with the brand, Hennigan competed in singles competition and won the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship]] twice. In June 2007, Hennigan was drafted from Raw to the [[ECW (WWE)|ECW]] brand. During that time, he won the vacant [[ECW World Heavyweight Championship|ECW World Championship]] once, which was his first [[World Heavyweight Championship (professional wrestling)|world championship]]. Hennigan formed a partnership with [[Mike Mizanin|The Miz]] in late 2007, with the two capturing the WWE Tag Team Championship and the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|World Tag Team Championship]] on separate occasions. They split in April 2009, and Morrison returned to SmackDown, where he won the Intercontinental Championship for the third time in September 2009.

====Bischoff's assistant and apprentice (2004)====
On March 1, 2004 Hennigan debuted on the [[WWE Raw|Raw]] [[WWE Brand Extension|brand]] under the [[ring name]] "Johnny Blaze". His [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Gimmick|gimmick]] was that he was the apprentice and assistant of the Raw [[Professional wrestling authority figures#General Managers|General Manager]], [[Eric Bischoff]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2004/03/02/367629.html|title=Raw: Rock and Sock return|date=2004-03-02|last=Tylwalk|first=Nick|accessdate=2009-02-23|work=Slam!

Sports|publisher=[[Canadian Online Explorer]]}}</ref> The Nitro name, which finally stuck, was a reference to ''[[WCW Monday Nitro]]'', the flagship show of [[World Championship Wrestling]] for which Bischoff had previously worked.

Upon his return to OVW, Hennigan was put into a [[Feud (professional wrestling)|feud]] with his former partner [[Matt Cappotelli]]. During the course of the feud [[Melina Perez|Melina]] was brought in to the company as Nitro's ex-girlfriend and an ally of Cappotelli, only to [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Turn|turn]] on him and side with Nitro.
