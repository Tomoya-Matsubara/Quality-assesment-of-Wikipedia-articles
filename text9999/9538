The '''Chola dynasty''' ({{lang-ta|<U+0B9A><U+0BCB><U+0BB4><U+0BB0><U+0BCD> <U+0B95><U+0BC1><U+0BB2><U+0BAE><U+0BCD>}}, {{IPA2|<U+02C8>t<U+0361><U+0283>o<U+02D0><U+027B><U+0259>}}) was a [[Tamil people|Tamil]] [[dynasty]] which was one of the longest-ruling in some parts of [[southern India]]. The earliest datable references to the dynasty are in inscriptions from the 3rd century BC left by [[Asoka]], a northern ruler; the dynasty continued to reign over varying territory until the 12th century AD. 

The heartland of the Cholas was the fertile valley of the [[Kaveri River]], but they ruled a significantly larger area at the height of their [[Great power|power]] from the later half of the 9th century till the beginning of the 13th century.<ref name=sastri>[[K.A.

The Cholas left a lasting legacy. Their patronage of [[Chola literature|Tamil literature]] and their zeal in building temples have resulted in some great works of Tamil literature and architecture.<ref name=keay215/> The Chola kings were avid builders and envisioned the temples in their kingdoms not only as places of worship but also as centres of economic activity.<ref name=geeta20>Vasudevan, pp 20&ndash;22</ref><ref>Keay, pp 217&ndash;218</ref> They pioneered a centralised form of [[Chola Government|government]] and established a disciplined bureaucracy.

== Origins ==
{{TNhistory}}

There is very little information available regarding the origin of the Chola Dynasty. The antiquity of this dynasty is evident from the mentions in [[Sangam literature|ancient Tamil literature]] and in inscriptions. Later [[medieval Cholas]] also claimed a long and ancient lineage to their dynasty.  Mentions in the early [[Sangam Literature|Sangam literature]] (c. 150 CE)<ref name="sangam">The age of Sangam is established through the correlation between the evidence on foreign trade found in the poems and the writings by ancient Greek and Romans such as ''Periplus''. [[K.A. Nilakanta Sastri]], ''A History of South India'', p 106</ref> indicate that the earliest kings of the dynasty antedated 100 CE. Parimelalagar, the annotator of the Tamil classic [[Tirukkural]], mentions that this could be the name of an ancient king.

The most commonly held view is that this is, like [[Chera Dynasty|Cheras]] and Pandyas, the name of the ruling family or clan of immemorial antiquity.<ref name="tirukkural">[[Tirukkural]] poem 955. The annotator Parimelazhagar writes "The charity of people with ancient lineage (such as the Cholas, the Pandyas and the Cheras) are forever generous in spite of their reduced means".</ref><ref>Other names in common use for the Cholas are ''Killi'' (<U+0B95><U+0BBF><U+0BB3><U+0BCD><U+0BB3><U+0BBF>), ''Valavan'' (<U+0BB5><U+0BB3><U+0BB5><U+0BA9><U+0BCD>) and ''Sembiyan'' (<U+0B9A><U+0BC7><U+0BAE><U+0BCD><U+0BAA><U+0BBF><U+0BAF><U+0BA9><U+0BCD>). ''Killi'' perhaps comes from the Tamil ''kil'' (<U+0B95><U+0BBF><U+0BB3><U+0BCD>) meaning dig or cleave and conveys the idea of a digger or a worker of the land. This word often forms an integral part of early Chola names like [[Nedunkilli]], [[Nalankilli]] and so on, but almost drops out of use in later times. ''Valavan'' is most probably connected with 'valam' (<U+0BB5><U+0BB3><U+0BAE><U+0BCD>) <U+2013> fertility and means owner or ruler of a fertile country. ''Sembiyan'' is generally taken to mean a descendant of [[Shibi]] <U+2013> a legendary hero whose self-sacrifice in saving a dove from the pursuit of a falcon figures among the early Chola legends and forms the subject matter of the [[Sibi Jataka]] among the [[Jataka]] stories of [[Buddhism]]. [[K.A. Nilakanta Sastri]], ''The C<U+014D><U+013B>as'', pp 19&ndash;20</ref> In Tamil lexicon ''Chola'' means ''Soazhi'' or ''Saei'' denoting a newly formed kingdom, in the lines of ''Pandya'' or the old country. ''<ref>Archaeological News 
A. L. Frothingham, Jr. The American Journal of Archaeology and of the History of the Fine Arts, Vol. 4, No. 1 (Mar., 1888), pp. 69&ndash;125</ref> ''Sora'' or ''Chozha'' in Tamil becomes ''Chola'' in [[Sanskrit]] and ''Chola'' or ''Choda'' in [[Telugu language|Telugu]].<ref>"The name Coromandel is used for the east coast of India from Cape Comorin to Nellore, or from point Calimere to the mouth of Krishna. The word is a corrupt form of ''Choramandala'' or the ''Realm of Chora'', which is the Tamil form of the title of the ''Chola'' dynasty". - Gupta AN, p 182</ref>

On the history of the early Cholas there is very little authentic written evidence available. Historians during the past 150 years have gleaned a lot of knowledge on the subject from a variety of sources such as ancient Tamil Sangam literature, oral traditions, religious texts, temple and [[Copper-plate grant|copperplate inscriptions]]. The main source for the available information of the early Cholas is the early Tamil literature of the Sangam Period.<ref name="sangam2">The period covered by the Sangam poetry is likely to extend not longer than five or six generations - [[K.A. Nilakanta Sastri]], ''The C<U+014D><U+013B>as'', p 3</ref> There are also brief notices on the Chola country and its towns, ports and commerce furnished by the ''[[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]]'' (''Periplus Maris Erythraei'').<ref name="periplus">The ''Periplus'' refers to the region of the eastern seaboard of South India as ''Damirica '' - [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/periplus.html ''The Periplus of the Erythraean Sea''] (Ancient History source book).</ref> ''Periplus'' is a work by an anonymous [[Alexandrian]] merchant, written in the time of [[Domitian]] (81&ndash;96) and contains very little information of the Chola country.<ref>[[K.A. Nilakanta Sastri]], ''A History of South India'', p 23</ref> Writing half a century later, the geographer [[Ptolemy]] gives more detail about the Chola country, its port and its inland cities.<ref name="ptolomy">Ptolemy mentions the town of [[Puhar|Kaveripattinam]] (under the form ''Khaberis'') - ''Proceedings, American Philosophical Society'' (1978), vol. 122, No. 6, p 414</ref> ''[[Mahavamsa]]'', a [[Buddhist]] text written down during the 5th century CE, recounts a number of conflicts between the inhabitants of [[Ceylon]] and Cholas in the 1st century BCE.<ref name="mahavamsa">Mahavamsa eText - http://lakdiva.org/mahavamsa/</ref> Cholas are mentioned in the [[Pillars of Ashoka]] (inscribed 273 BCE&ndash;232 BCE) inscriptions, where they are mentioned among the kingdoms which, though not subject to Ashoka, were on friendly terms with him.<ref name="asoka">The Asokan inscriptions speak of the Cholas in plural, implying that, in his time, there were more than one Chola - [[K.A. Nilakanta Sastri]], ''The C<U+014D><U+013B>as'', p 20. However, this analogy is doubtful because the same inscription, all the kings either friendly or subordinate to the Mauryan Empire have been referred to in plural for eg. subordinates like the Greeks, the Kambojas, the Nabhakas, the Nabhapamkits, the Bhojas, the Pitinikas, the Andhras and the Palidas or friendly empires have been called 'Cholas' and 'Pandyas' (and as far as Tamraparani or modern Sri Lanka - significantly the word 'Tamraparani' does not clearly mean territory ruled by one or more kings. It is indeed a known fact that for most of their history though, the Pandyas ruled their dominions with members of the same family dividing their empire into various parts and controlling various aspects of administration of their territories. The Cholas too followed the same practice with sons of the Chola emperors controlling various parts or aspects of their territories or administration along with their relatives or allies who bore the common title 'Chola'. This knowledge about the friendly empires of both 'Pandyas' and 'Cholas' must have prompted Ashoka to refer to them thus.

==History ==
{{Chola history}}
The history of the Cholas falls into four periods: the [[early Cholas]] of the Sangam literature, the interregnum between the fall of the Sangam Cholas and the rise of the medieval Cholas under [[Vijayalaya Chola|Vijayalaya]] (c. 848), the dynasty of Vijayalaya, and finally the [[Later Chola]] dynasty of Kulothunga Chola I from the third quarter of the eleventh century.<ref name="CC">The direct line of Cholas of the Vijayalaya dynasty came to an end with the death of [[Virarajendra Chola]] and the assassination of his son [[Athirajendra Chola]]. [[Kulothunga Chola I]], ascended the throne in 1070. [[K.A. Nilakanta Sastri]], ''A History of South India'', pp 170&ndash;172</ref>

===Early Cholas===
{{Main| Early Cholas}}

The earliest Chola kings for whom there is tangible evidence are mentioned in the Sangam literature. Scholars generally agree that this literature belongs to the first few centuries of the [[common era]].<ref name="sangam"/> The internal chronology of this literature is still far from settled, and at present a connected account of the history of the period cannot be derived. The Sangam literature records the names of the kings and the princes, and of the poets who extolled them. Despite a rich literature that depicts the life and work of these people, these cannot be worked into connected history.<ref>[[K.A. Nilakanta Sastri]], ''A History of South India'', pp 19&ndash;20, pp 104&ndash;106</ref>

The Sangam literature also records legends about mythical Chola kings.<ref>[[K.A. Nilakanta Sastri]], ''A History of South India'', pp 104&ndash;116</ref><ref name=asi3/><ref name=tri457/><ref name="sun">[[Manimekalai]] (poem 00-10)</ref> These myths speak of the Chola king Kantaman, a supposed contemporary of the sage [[Agastya]], whose devotion brought the river Kaveri into existence.<ref>[[K.A. Nilakanta Sastri]], ''A History of South India'', p 67</ref><ref name="kantan">Manimekalai (poem 22-030)</ref> 

Two names stand out prominently from among those Chola kings known to have existed, who feature in Sangam literature: [[Karikala Chola]]<ref>Majumdar, p 137</ref><ref name=kulke99>Kulke and Rothermund, p 104</ref><ref name=tri458>Tripathi, p 458</ref> and [[Kocengannan]].<ref name=sastri116>[[K.A.

Nilakanta Sastri]], ''A History of South India'', pp 105&ndash;106</ref><ref name="earlydate">The only evidence for the approximate period of these early kings is the Sangam Literature and the synchronization with the [[history of Sri Lanka]] as given in the Mahavamsa. [[Gajabahu I]] who is said to be the contemporary of the Chera [[Senguttuvan]] is determined to belong to the 2nd century. This leads us to date the poems mentioning Senguttuvan and his contemporaries to belong to this period.</ref> [[Urayur]] (now in/part-of [[Thiruchirapalli]]) was their oldest capital.<ref name=tri457/> [[Kaveripattinam]] also served as an early Chola capital.<ref>[[K.A. Nilakanta Sastri]], ''A History of South India'', p 113</ref> The ''[[Mahavamsa]]'' mentions that an ethnic Tamil adventurer, a Chola prince known as [[Elara (King)|Elara]], invaded the island around 235 BCE and that King Gajabahu visited Chera Cenguttuvan around 108 CE.<ref name=tri457/><ref>{{cite web|title=Beginnings of tamil rule in ceylon|author=Gnanaprakasar, Nallur Swami|url=http://www.lankalibrary.com/geo/ancient/tamil%20rule.htm|publisher=lankalibrary.com|accessdate=2006-12-05}}</ref>

===Interregnum ===
There is not much information about the transition period of around three centuries from the end of the Sangam age (c. 300) to that in which the Pandyas and [[Pallava]]s dominate the Tamil country.<ref>[[K.A. Nilakanta Sastri]], ''A History of South India'', p 130</ref> An obscure dynasty, the [[Kalabhras]], invaded the Tamil country, displaced the existing kingdoms and ruled for around three centuries.<ref>[[K.A.

Nilakanta Sastri]], ''A History of South India'', p 135</ref> Little is known of the fate of the Cholas during the succeeding three centuries until the accession of Vijayalaya in the second quarter of the ninth century.<ref name="choda">[[K.A. Nilakanta Sastri]], ''A History of South India'', pp 130, 133. Quote:"The Cholas disappeared from the Tamil land almost completely in this debacle, though a branch of them can be traced towards the close of the period in Rayalaseema - the Telugu-Chodas, whose kingdom is mentioned by Yuan Chwang in the seventh century A.D</ref>

[[Epigraphy]] and literature provide a few faint glimpses of the transformations that came over this ancient line of kings during this long interval. What is certain is that when the power of the Cholas fell to its lowest ebb and that of the Pandyas and Pallavas rose to the north and south of them,<ref name=tri458/><ref name="cholavassal">[[K.A. Nilakanta Sastri]], ''The C<U+014D><U+013B>as'', p 102</ref> this dynasty was compelled to seek refuge and patronage under their more successful rivals.<ref name=kulke115>Kulke and Rothermund, p 115</ref><ref name="pallavapandya">Pandya [[Kadungon]] and Pallava [[Simhavishnu]] overthrew the Kalabhras. Acchchutakalaba is likely the last Kalabhra king - Nilakanta Sastri, ''The C<U+014D><U+013B>as'', p 102</ref> The Cholas continued to rule over a diminished territory in the neighbourhood of Uraiyur, but only in a minor capacity. In spite of their reduced powers, the Pandayas and Pallavas accepted Chola princesses in marriage, possibly out of regard for their reputation.<ref name="Cholaland">''[[Periyapuranam]]'', a Saiva religious work of 12th century tells us of the Pandya king Nindrasirnedumaran, who had for his queen a Chola princess. Chopra ''et al.'', p 95</ref> Numerous inscriptions of Pallavas, Pandyas and [[Chalukya]] of this period mention conquering 'the Chola country'.<ref name="cholaref">Copperplate grants of the Pallava Buddhavarman(late 4th century) mention that the king as the 'underwater fire that destroyed the ocean of the Chola army'. - Nilakanta Sastri, ''The C<U+014D><U+013B>as'', pp 104&ndash;105</ref><ref>Simhavishnu (575&ndash;600) is also stated to have seized the Chola country. Mahendravarman I was called the 'crown of the Chola country' in his inscriptions. The Chalukya [[Pulakesin II]] in his inscriptions in [[Aihole]] states that he defeated the Pallavas and brought relief to the Cholas. - [[K.A. Nilakanta Sastri]], ''The C<U+014D><U+013B>as'', p 105</ref> Despite this loss in influence and power, it is unlikely that the Cholas lost total grip of the territory around Uraiyur, their old capital, as Vijayalaya, when he rose to prominence hailed from this geographical area.<ref name=chopra95>Chopra ''et al.'', p 95</ref><ref name=tri459>Tripathi, p459</ref>

Around the 7th century, a Chola kingdom flourished in present-day Andhra Pradesh.<ref name=chopra95/> These [[Telugu Cholas]] (or Chodas) traced their descent to the early Sangam Cholas. However, it is not known if they had any relation to the early Cholas.<ref>[[K.A. Nilakanta Sastri]], ''A History of South India'', p 4. Quote:"it is not known what relation, if any, the Telugu-Chodas of the Renadu country in the Ceded District, bore to their namesakes of the Tamil land, though they claimed descent from Karikala, the most celebrated of the early Chola monarchs of the Sangam age"</ref> It is possible that a branch of the Tamil Cholas migrated north during the time of the Pallavas to establish a kingdom of their own, away from the dominating influences of the Pandyas and Pallavas.<ref name="TC">[[K.A. Nilakanta Sastri]] postulates that there was a live connection between the early Cholas and the Renandu Cholas of the Andhra country. The northward migration probably took place during the Pallava domination of Simhavishnu. Sastri also categorically rejects the claims that these were the descendants of Karikala Chola - [[K.A. Nilakanta Sastri]], ''The C<U+014D><U+013B>as'', p 107</ref> The [[China|Chinese]] pilgrim [[Xuanzang]], who spent several months in [[Kanchipuram]] during 639&ndash;640 writes about the 'kingdom of Culi-ya', in an apparent reference to the Telugu Chodas.<ref name="choda" /><ref name="cholavassal"/><ref>Tripathi, pp 458&ndash;459</ref>

While there is little reliable information on the Cholas during the period between the early Cholas and Vijayalaya dynasties, there is an abundance of materials from diverse sources on the Vijayalaya and the Later Chola dynasties. A large number of stone inscriptions by the Cholas themselves and by their rival kings, Pandyas and [[Chalukyas]], and copper-plate grants, have been instrumental in constructing the history of Cholas of that period.<ref name="inscriptions">The Chola inscriptions followed the practice of prefacing the intended text with a historical recounting, in a poetic and ornate style of Tamil, of the main achievements of the reign and the descent of the king and of his ancestors - ''South Indian Inscriptions'', Vol 2</ref><ref>Chopra ''et al.'', p 102</ref> Around 850, Vijayalaya rose from obscurity to take an opportunity arising out of a conflict between Pandyas and Pallavas,<ref name="purambayam">The opportunity for Vijayalaya arose during the battle of Sripurambayam between the Pallava ally Ganga Pritvipati and the Pandya Varaguna.

The Chola dynasty was at the peak of its influence and power during the medieval period.<ref name="sastri5"/> Through their leadership and vision, kings such as the second Chola King [[Aditya I]] who caused the demise of the [[Pallavas]], defeated the [[Pandyas]] of [[Madurai]] and occupied very large parts of the Kannada country and had marital ties with the [[Gangas]], way back in 885 AD, his son [[Parantaka I]], who conquered [[Sri Lanka]] known as Ilangai way back in 925 AD, [[Sundara Chola]], also known as Parantaka Chola II who regained territories from the [[Rashtrakutas]] and expanded the Chola dominions up to [[Bhatkal]] in Kannada country, [[Rajaraja Chola I]] and [[Rajendra Chola I]] extended the Chola kingdom beyond the traditional limits of a Tamil kingdom.<ref name=kulke115/><ref name=keay215/> At its peak, the Chola Empire stretched from the island of Sri Lanka in the south to the [[Godavari River|Godavari]]-[[Krishna]] basin in the north, up to the Konkan coast in Bhatkal, the entire Malabar Coast in addition to [[Lakshadweep]], [[Maldives]] and vast areas of [[Chera]] country. The kingdoms of Deccan and the eastern coast were subordinates, feudatories of the Cholas or other kingdoms like the [[Chalukyas]] between 1000-1075 AD paid tribute to the Cholas.<ref>K.A.Nilakanta Sastri, ''Advanced History of India'' (1955), pp. 174</ref> Rajendra Chola I completed the conquest of the island of Sri Lanka and captured the Sinhala king Mahinda V prisoner, in addition to his conquests of Rattapadi (territories of the [[Rashtrakutas]], [[Chalukya]] country, [[Talakkad]], [[Kolar]] (where the Kolaramma temple still has his portrait statue) in Kannada country .<ref>K.A.Nilakanta Sastri, ''Advanced History of India'' (1955), pp. 191</ref>.

The [[Western Chalukyas]] under [[Satyasraya]] and [[Somesvara I]] tried to wriggle out of Chola domination from time to time, primarily  due to the Chola influence in the [[Vengi]] kingdom.<ref name=sastri158>[[K.A.

Cholas always successfully controlled the Chalukyas in the western [[Deccan]] by routing them in war constantly and levying tribute on them.<ref>Chopra ''et al.'', pp 107&ndash;109</ref> It is also pertinent to note that even under the not so strong emperors of the Cholas like Kulothunga I, Vikrama Chola etc. the wars against the Chalukyas were mainly fought in Chalukya territories in Karnataka or in the Telugu country like Vengi, Kakinada or Anantapur or Gutti.   In any case, in the internecine wars among the small Kannada kingdoms of the Kadambas, Hoysalas, Vaidumbas or Kalachuris, the Chalukya interference was to cause them dearly with these Kingdoms steadily increasing their stock and ultimately the Hoysalas, the Kakatiyas, the Kalachuris and the Seunas consuming the Chalukyas and sending them into oblivion.<ref name="sastri6">[[K.A. Nilakanta Sastri]], ''A History of South India'',</ref> With the [[Kalachuris]] occupying the Chalukyan capital for over 35 years around 1135 AD and with the occupation of Dharwar in North Central Karnataka by the [[Hoysalas]] under [[Vishnuvardhana]] where he based himself with his son [[Narasimha I]] in-charge at the [[Hoysala]] capital Dwarasamudra around AD 1149, the Chalukya kingdom was already starting to dissolve, mainly due to incompetency of its rulers after 1120 AD. 

The Cholas under [[Kulothunga Chola III]] even collaborated to the herald the dissolution of the [[Chalukyas]] by aiding [[Hoysalas]] under [[Veera Ballala II]], the son-in-law of the Chola monarch, and sounded the death-knell of the [[Western Chalukyas]] in a series of wars with [[Somesvara IV]] between 1185-1190 AD, the last Chalukya king whose territories did not even include the erstwhile Chalukyan capitals Badami, Manyakheta or Kalyani. That was the final dissolution of Chalukyan power<ref name=sastri180>[[K.A. Nilakanta Sastri]], ''A History of South India'', p. 180</ref> though the [[Chalukyas]] existed only in name since 1135-1140.  In contrast, the Cholas would be stable till 1215 AD, and finally getting consumed by the [[Pandiyan]] empire and ceasing to exist by 1280 AD.<ref name=sastri179>[[K.A. Nilakanta Sastri]], ''A History of South India'', p.179</ref> 

On the other hand, throughout the period from 1150-1280 AD,  the staunchest opponents of the Cholas were Pandya princes who tried to win independence for their traditional territories. This period saw constant warfare between the Cholas and these antagonists. The Cholas also fought regular wars with the Easter [[Gangas]] of Kalinga, protected Vengi though it remained largely independent under Chola control, and had domination of the entire eastern coast with their feudatories the Telugu Chodas, Velananti Cholas, Renandu Cholas etc. who also always aided the [[Cholas]] in their successful campaigns against the [[Chalukyas]] and levying tribute on the Kannada kingdoms and fought constantly with the [[Sinhalese people|Sinhala]]s, who attempted to overthrow the Chola occupation of [[Lanka]], but till the time of the [[Later Chola]] king Kulottunga I the Cholas had firm control over [[Lanka]]. In fact, a [[Later Chola]] king [[Rajadhiraja Chola II]] was strong enough to prevail over a confederation of five [[Pandya]] princes who were aided by their traditional friend, the king of [[Lanka]], this once again gave control of [[Lanka]] to the Cholas despite the fact that they were not strong under the resolute [[Rajadhiraja Chola II]]. However, [[Rajadhiraja Chola II]]'s successor, the last great Chola monarch [[Kulottunga Chola III]] reinforced the hold of the Cholas by quelling rebellion and disturbances in [[Lanka]] and Madurai, defeated Hoysala generals under Veera Ballala II in Karuvur, in addition to holding on to his traditional territories in Tamil country, Eastern Gangavadi, Draksharama, Vengi and [[Kalinga]]. After this, he entered into a marital alliance with Veera Ballala II (with Ballala's marriage to a Chola princess) and his relationship with Hoysalas seems to have become friendlier.<ref>"Kulottunga fought successful wars against the Cheras and Hoysala Ballala II and performed Vijayabhisheka at Karuvur in A.D.1193."

He re-established Chola suzerainty over the Adigaimans of Tagadur, defeated a Chera ruler in battle and performed a ''vijayabhisheka'' in Karuvur (1193). His relations with the Hoysala Ballala II seem to have become friendly afterwards, for Ballala married a Chola princess". K. A.

===Later Cholas===
{{Main| Later Cholas }}(1070-1279 AD)
[[File:kulothunga territories cl.png|thumb|right|Chola territories during Kulothunga Chola I c. 1120]] 
Marital and political alliances between the [[Eastern Chalukyas]] began during the reign of Rajaraja following his invasion of Vengi.<ref name="Keay">Keay, p 216</ref> Rajaraja Chola's daughter married Chalukya prince Vimaladitya.<ref>Majumdar, p 405</ref> Rajendra Chola's daughter was also married to an eastern Chalukya prince [[Rajaraja Narendra]].<ref name=chopra120>Chopra ''et al.'', p 120</ref>

Virarajendra Chola's son [[Athirajendra Chola]] was assassinated in a civil disturbance in 1070, and [[Kulothunga Chola I]], the son of Rajaraja Narendra, ascended the Chola throne starting the Later Chola dynasty.<ref name="sastri6"/><ref name=chopra120/><ref>Majumdar, p 372</ref>

The Later Chola dynasty saw capable rulers in [[Kulothunga Chola I]], his son [[Vikrama Chola]], other successors like [[Rajaraja Chola II]], [[Rajadhiraja Chola II]] and the great [[Kulothunga Chola III]], who conquered [[Kalinga]], [[Ilam]] and [[Kataha]]; however, the rule of the later Cholas was not as strong as those of the emperors up to [[Rajendra Chola II]]. While the rule of [[Kulothunga Chola III]] was stable and very prosperous up to 1215 AD, during his time itself, the decline of the Chola power started beginning with his defeat by Maravarman Sundara Pandiyan II in1215-16 AD.<ref name=tri471>Tripathi, p 471</ref> The Cholas lost control of the island of Lanka and were driven out by the revival of Sinhala power. Around 1118, they lost control of Vengi to the [[Western Chalukyas|Western Chalukya]]  and Gangavadi (southern [[Mysore]] districts) to the [[Hoysalas]]. However, these were only temporary setbacks, because under king [[Vikrama Chola]] successor of [[Kulothunga Chola I]], the Cholas lost no time shortly after his accession in recovering the province of Vengi by defeating Chalukya Somesvara III and also recovering Gangavadi from the Hoysalas. In the Pandya territories, the lack of a controlling central administration prompted a number of claimants to the Pandya throne to cause a civil war in which the Sinhalas and the Cholas were involved by proxy. The Later Chola king [[Kulothunga Chola III]] claimed control over Madurai, Karuvur (Karur), Ilam (Sri Lanka), Draksharama, Vengi. On account of his help to Hoysala Veera Ballala II against the [[Chalukyas]] first and then against the [[Kalachuris]], [[Kulothunga Chola III]] also used the title 'Hoysala Puravaradheeshwaran' in his inscriptions.<ref>Details of the Pandyan civil war and the role played by the Cholas and Sinhalas, are present in the ''[[Mahavamsa]]'' as well as the Pallavarayanpettai Inscriptions. ''South Indian Inscriptions'', Vol. 12</ref><ref name=chopra128>Chopra ''et al.'', pp 128&ndash;129</ref>

The Cholas, under [[Rajaraja Chola III]] and later, his successor [[Rajendra Chola III]], were quite weak and therefore, experienced continuous trouble. One feudatory, the [[Kadava]] chieftain [[Kopperunchinga I]], even held Rajaraja Chola III as hostage for sometime.<ref>[[K.A. Nilakanta Sastri]], ''A History of South India'', p 194</ref><ref name=tri472>Tripathi, p 472</ref> At the close of the 12th century, the growing influence of the Hoysalas replaced the declining Chalukyas as the main player in the Kannada country, but they too faced constant trouble from the Seunas and the Kalachuris who were occupying Chalukya capital for those empires were their new rivals. So naturally, the Hoysalas found it convenient to have friendly relations with the Cholas from the time of [[Kulothunga Chola III]], who had defeated Hoysala Veera Ballala II but who had subsequent marital relations with the Chola monarch. This continued during the time of [[Rajaraja Chola III]] the son and successor of [[Kulothunga Chola III]]<ref name=tri471/><ref name=majumdar410>Majumdar, p 410</ref>  

The Pandyas in the south had risen to the rank of a great power who ultimately banished the Hoysalas who were allies of the Cholas from Tamil country and subsequently causing the demise of the Cholas themselves in AD 1279. They first steadily gained control of the Tamil country as well as territories in [[Sri Lanka]], Chera country, Telugu country under Maravarman Sundara Pandiyan II and his able successor [[Jatavarman Sundara Pandyan]] before inflicting several defeats on the joint forces of the [[Cholas]] under Rajaraja Chola III, his successor Rajendra Chola III and the [[Hoysalas]] under Someshwara, his son Ramanatha<ref name=tri471/>  Rajendra III tried to survive by aligning with the Kadava Pallavas and the Hoysalas in turn in order to counter the constantly rising power of the Pandyans who were the major players in the Tamil country from AD 1215 and had intelligently consolidated their position in Madurai-Rameswaram-Ilam-Cheranadu and Kanniyakumari belt, and had been steadily increasing their territories in the Kaveri belt between Dindigul-Tiruchy-Karur-Satyamangalam as well as in the Kaveri Delta i.e. Thanjavur-Mayuram-Chidambaram-Vriddhachalam-Kanchi, finally marching all the way up to Arcot<U+2014>Tirumalai-Nellore-Visayawadai-Vengi-Kalingam belt by 1250 AD. 

The [[Pandyas]] steadily routed both the Hoysalas and the Cholas.<ref name="sastri195"/> They also dispossessed the Hoysalas, who had been overestimating their power by interfering in the politics of Tamil country by routing them under Jatavarman Sundara Pandiyan at Kannanur Kuppam and chased the Hoysalas back to the Mysore plateau and stopped the war only thereafter.<ref name="sastri196"/> At the close of Rajendra's reign, the Pandyan empire was at the height of prosperity and had taken the place of the Chola empire in the eyes of the foreign observers.<ref>Tripathi, p 485</ref> The last recorded date of Rajendra III is 1279. There is no evidence that Rajendra was followed immediately by another Chola prince.<ref>[[K.A. Nilakanta Sastri]], ''A History of South India'', p 197</ref><ref name=chopra130>Chopra ''et al.'', p 130</ref> The Hoysalas were routed from Kannanur Kuppam around 1279 by Kulasekhara Pandiyan and in the same war the last Chola emperor Rajendra III was routed and the Chola empire ceased to exist thereafter. Thus the Chola empire was completely overshadowed by the Pandyan empire and sank into obscurity and ceased to exist by the end of the 13th century.<ref name=tri472/><ref name=chopra130/>

== Government and society ==
{{Main|Chola Government}}

===Chola country===
According to Tamil tradition, the old Chola country comprised the region that includes the modern-day [[Tiruchirapalli District]] and the [[Thanjavur District]] in [[Tamil Nadu]]. The river [[Kaveri]] and its tributaries dominate this landscape of generally flat country that gradually slopes towards the sea, unbroken by major hills or valleys. The river Kaveri, also known as ''Ponni'' (golden) river, had a special place in the culture of Cholas. The annual floods in the Kaveri marked an occasion for celebration, ''[[Adiperukku]]'', in which the whole nation took part.

Kaveripoompattinam on the coast near the Kaveri delta was a major port town.<ref name=tri457>Tripathi, p 457</ref> Ptolemy knew of this and the other port town of [[Nagappattinam]] as the most important centres of Cholas.<ref name="ptolomy"/> These two towns became hubs of trade and commerce and attracted many religious faiths, including Buddhism.<ref name="milinda">The Buddhist work ''Milinda Panha'' dated to the early Christian era, mentions Kolapttna among the best-known sea ports on the Chola coast. Nilakanta Sastri, ''The C<U+014D><U+013B>as'', p 23</ref> Roman ships found their way into these ports. Roman coins dating from the early centuries of the common era have been found near the Kaveri delta.<ref name="Nagaswamy">Nagaswamy, [http://tamilartsacademy.com/books/coins/cover.html ''Tamil Coins - a study'']</ref><ref>[[K.A. Nilakanta Sastri]], ''A History of South India'', p 107</ref>

The other major towns were Thanjavur, Uraiyur and Kudanthai, now known as [[Kumbakonam]].<ref name=tri457/> After Rajendra Chola moved his capital to [[Gangaikonda Cholapuram]], Thanjavur lost its importance.<ref>Chopra ''et al.'', p 106</ref> The later Chola kings moved around their capitals frequently and made cities such as [[Chidambaram]], [[Madurai]] and Kanchipuram their regional capitals.

===Nature of government===
In the age of the Cholas, the whole of South India was, for the first time, brought under a single government,<ref name="unity">The only other time when peninsular India would be brought under one umbrella before the [[History of the Republic of India|Independence]] was during the [[Vijayanagara Empire]] (1336&ndash;1614)</ref> when a serious attempt was made to face and solve the problems of public administration. The Cholas' system of government was monarchical, as in the Sangam age.<ref name="kulke99"/> However, there was little in common between the local chiefdoms of the earlier time and the imperial-like states of Rajaraja Chola and his successors.<ref>Stein, p 26</ref>

Between 980, and c. 1150, the Chola Empire comprised the entire south Indian peninsula, extending east to west from coast to coast, and bounded to the north by an irregular line along the Tungabhadra river and the Vengi frontier.<ref name=kulke115/><ref name=majumdar407/> Although Vengi had a separate political existence, it was closely connected to the Chola Empire and, for all practical purposes, the Chola dominion extended up to the banks of the Godavari river.<ref name="godavari">[[K.A. Nilakanta Sastri]], ''The C<U+014D><U+013B>as'', p 448</ref>

Thanjavur, and later, Gangaikonda Cholapuram were the imperial capitals. However both Kanchipuram and Madurai were considered to be regional capitals, in which occasional courts were held. The king was the supreme commander and a benevolent dictator.<ref>There were no legislature or controls on the executive. The king ruled by edicts, which generally followed ''[[dharma]]'' a culturally mediated concept of 'fair and proper' practice. [[K.A. Nilakanta Sastri]], ''The C<U+014D><U+013B>as'', pp 451, 460&ndash;461</ref> His administrative role consisted of issuing oral commands to responsible officers when representations were made to him.<ref name="oralorder">For example, Rajaraja is mentioned in the Layden copperplate grant to have issued an oral order for a gift to a Buddhist vihara at Nagapattinam, and his orders were written out by a clerk - [[K.A. Nilakanta Sastri]], ''The C<U+014D><U+013B>as'', p 461</ref> A powerful bureaucracy assisted the king in the tasks of administration and in executing his orders. Due to the lack of a legislature or a legislative system in the modern sense, the fairness of king's orders dependent on the goodness of the man and in his belief in ''Dharma''<U+2014>a sense of fairness and justice. 

The Chola kings built temples and endowed them with great wealth.<ref name=geeta20/><ref>Keay, p 218</ref> The temples acted not only as places of worship but also as centres of economic activity, benefiting their entire community.<ref name=geeta20/><ref name="temple">Some of the output of villages throughout the kingdom was given to temples that reinvested some of the wealth accumulated as loans to the settlements. The temple served as a centre for redistribution of wealth and contributed towards the integrity of the kingdom. - Keay, pp 217&ndash;218</ref>

===Local government===
Every village was a self-governing unit.<ref name=tri474>Tripathi, pp 474&ndash;475</ref> A number of villages constituted a larger entity known as a ''Kurram'', ''Nadu'' or ''Kottram'', depending on the area.<ref name="tri474" /><ref name="Stein">Stein, p 20</ref><ref name="Stein"/><ref name=sastri185>[[K.A. Nilakanta Sastri]], ''A History of South India'', p 185</ref> A number of ''Kurrams'' constituted a ''valanadu''.<ref>[[K.A. Nilakanta Sastri]], ''A History of South India'', p 150</ref> These structures underwent constant change and refinement throughout the Chola period.<ref name="village">[[K.A. Nilakanta Sastri]], ''The C<U+014D><U+013B>as'', p 465</ref>

Justice was mostly a local matter in the Chola Empire; minor disputes were settled at the village level.<ref name=sastri185/> Punishment for minor crimes were in the form of fines or a direction for the offender to donate to some charitable endowment. Even crimes such as manslaughter or murder were punished with fines. Crimes of the state, such as treason, were heard and decided by the king himself; the typical punishment in these cases was either execution or the confiscation of property.<ref name="justice">[[K.A. Nilakanta Sastri]], ''The C<U+014D><U+013B>as'', p 477</ref>

===Foreign trade===

The Cholas excelled in foreign trade and maritime activity, extending their influence overseas to China and Southeast Asia.<ref>Kulke and Rothermund, pp 116&ndash;117</ref> Towards the end of the 9th century, southern India had developed extensive maritime and commercial activity.<ref>Kulke and Rothermund, p 12</ref><ref name=kulke118>Kulke and Rothermund, p 118</ref> The Cholas, being in possession of parts of both the west and the east coasts of peninsular India, were at the forefront of these ventures.<ref>Kulke and Rothermund, p 124</ref><ref>Tripathi, p 465</ref><ref>Tripathi, p 477</ref> The [[Tang dynasty]] of China, the [[Srivijaya]] empire in the Malayan archipelago under the Sailendras, and the [[Abbasid]] Kalifat at [[Baghdad]] were the main trading partners.<ref name="trade">[[K.A. Nilakanta Sastri]], ''The C<U+014D><U+013B>as'', p 604</ref>

Chinese [[Song Dynasty]] reports record that an embassy from ''Chulian'' (Chola) reached the Chinese court in the year 1077,<ref name=keay223>Keay, p 223</ref><ref name=kulke117>Kulke and Rothermund, p 117</ref><ref>See Thapar, p xv</ref> and that the king of the Chulien at the time was called ''Ti-hua-kia-lo''.<ref name="Chinese">[[K.A. Nilakanta Sastri]], ''The C<U+014D><U+013B>as'', p 316</ref> It is possible that these syllables denote "Deva Kulo[tunga]" (Kulothunga Chola I). This embassy was a trading venture and was highly profitable to the visitors, who returned with '81,800 strings of copper coins in exchange for articles of tributes, including glass articles, and spices'.<ref>The Tamil merchants took glassware, [[camphor]], [[sandalwood]], [[rhinoceros]] horns, [[ivory]], rose water,  [[asafoetida]], spices such as [[Black pepper|pepper]], [[cloves]], etc. [[K.A. Nilakanta Sastri]], ''A History of South India'', p 173</ref>

A fragmentary Tamil inscription found in [[Sumatra]] cites the name of a merchant guild ''Nanadesa Tisaiyayirattu Ainnutruvar'' (literally, "the five hundred from the four countries and the thousand directions"), a famous merchant guild in the Chola country.<ref name=kulke118/> The inscription is dated 1088, indicating that there was an active overseas trade during the Chola period.<ref name=kulke117/>

===Chola society===
There is little information on the size and the density of the population during the Chola reign.<ref>[[K.A. Nilakanta Sastri]], ''A History of South India'', p 284</ref> The stability in the core Chola region enabled the people to lead a productive and contented life. There is only one recorded instance of civil disturbance during the entire period of Chola reign.<ref name="disturbance"><U+2014>during the short reign of Virarajendra Chola, which possibly had some sectarian roots.</ref> However, there were reports of widespread famine caused by natural calamities.<ref>Chopra ''et al.'', p 125</ref><ref>Chopra ''et al.'', p 129</ref>

The quality of the inscriptions of the regime indicates a presence of high level of literacy and education in the society. The text in these inscriptions was written by court poets and engraved by talented artisans. Education in the contemporary sense was not considered important; there is circumstantial evidence to suggest that some village councils organised schools to teach the basics of reading and writing to children,<ref>Scharfe, p 180</ref> although there is no evidence of systematic educational system for the masses.<ref>17th century Italian traveler [[Pietro Della Valle]] (1623) has given a vivid account of the village schools in South India. These accounts reflect the system of primary education in existence until the morder times in Tamil Nadu</ref> Vocational education was through hereditary training in which the father passed on his skills to his sons. Tamil was the medium of education for the masses; Religious monasteries (''matha'' or ''gatika'') were centres of learning, which were supported by the government.<ref name="learning">Rajendra Chola I endowed a large college in which more than 280 students learnt from 14 teachers - [[K.A. Nilakanta Sastri]], ''A History of South India'', p 293</ref><ref name="subjects">The students studied a number of subjects in these colleges, including philosophy (''anvikshiki''), [[Vedas]] (''trayi'' <U+2013> the threefold Vedas of [[Rigveda]], [[Yajurveda]] and [[Samaveda]].

==Cultural contributions==
[[File:thanjavur temple.jpg|thumb|Detail of the main vimanam (tower) of the Thanjavur Temple]]
Under the Cholas, the Tamil country reached new heights of excellence in [[art]], [[religion]] and [[literature]].<ref>Mitter, p 2</ref> In all of these spheres, the Chola period marked the culmination of movements that had begun in an earlier age under the Pallavas.<ref name=sastri418>[[K.A. Nilakanta Sastri]], ''A History of South India'', p 418</ref><ref>Keay, p 174</ref> Monumental architecture in the form of majestic temples and [[sculpture]] in stone and [[bronze]] reached a finesse never before achieved in India.<ref name=Thapar403>It was, however, in bronze sculptures that the Chola craftsmen excelled, producing images rivalling the best anywhere. Thapar, p 403</ref>

The Chola conquest of Kadaram ([[Kedah]]) and Srivijaya, and their continued commercial contacts with the [[Mid-Imperial China|Chinese Empire]], enabled them to influence the local cultures.<ref name=kulke159>Kulke and Rothermund, p 159</ref> Many of the surviving examples of the [[Hinduism in Southeast Asia|Hindu cultural influence]] found today throughout the Southeast Asia owe much to the legacy of the Cholas.<ref name="prambanan">The great temple complex at [[Prambanan]] in [[Indonesia]] exhibit a number of similarities with the South Indian architecture.

=== Art ===
{{Main|Chola Art}}
The Cholas continued the temple-building traditions of the Pallava dynasty and contributed significantly to the Dravidian temple design.<ref name=tri479>Tripathi, p 479</ref> They built a number of [[Shiva|Siva]] temples along the banks of the river Kaveri. These temples were not on a large scale until the end of the 10th century.<ref name=sastri418/><ref>Harle, p 295</ref><ref>Mitter, p 57</ref>
[[File:Ornamented pillar Darasuram.jpg|thumb|left|With heavily ornamented pillars accurate in detail and richly sculpted walls, the Airavateswara temple at Darasuram is a classic example of Chola art and architecture]]

Temple building received great impetus from the conquests and the genius of Rajaraja Chola and his son Rajendra Chola I.<ref>Vasudevan, pp 21&ndash;24</ref> The maturity and grandeur to which the Chola architecture had evolved found expression in the two temples of Thanjavur and Gangaikondacholapuram. The magnificent [[Brihadisvara Temple|Siva temple of Thanjavur]], completed around 1009, is a fitting memorial to the material achievements of the time of Rajaraja. The largest and tallest of all Indian temples of its time, it is at the apex of South Indian architecture.<ref name="Keay"/><ref name="arch2">[[K.A. Nilakanta Sastri]], ''A History of South India'', p 421</ref>

The temple of Gangaikondacholisvaram at Gangaikondacholapuram, the creation of Rajendra Chola, was intended to excel its predecessor.<ref name=sastri423>[[K.A. Nilakanta Sastri]], ''A History of South India'', p423</ref><ref>Keay, p221</ref> Completed around 1030, only two decades after the temple at Thanjavur and in the same style, the greater elaboration in its appearance attests the more affluent state of the Chola Empire under Rajendra.<ref name=tri479/><ref name="GC">Nagasamy R, ''Gangaikondacholapuram''</ref>

The Brihadisvara Temple at Thanjavur, the temple of Gangaikondacholisvaram at Gangaikondacholapuram and the [[Airavatesvara Temple]] at [[Darasuram]] were declared as [[World Heritage Site]]s by the [[UNESCO]], and are referred to as the [[Great Living Chola Temples|Great living Chola temples]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/250 |title=Great Living Chola Temples |publisher=[[UNESCO]]| accessdate=2008-06-03}}</ref>

The Chola period is also remarkable for its sculptures and bronzes.<ref>Chopra ''et al.'', p 186</ref><ref>Mitter, p 163</ref><ref>Thapar, pp 309&ndash;310</ref> Among the existing specimens in museums around the world and in the temples of South India may be seen many fine figures of Siva in various forms, such as [[Vishnu]] and his consort [[Lakshmi]], and the Saivaite saints.<ref name=tri479/> Though conforming generally to the iconographic conventions established by long tradition, the sculptors worked with great freedom in the 11<sup>th</sup> and the 12<sup>th</sup> centuries to achieve a classic grace and grandeur. The best example of this can be seen in the form of [[Nataraja]] the Divine Dancer.<ref name="nataraja">Wolpert, p174</ref><ref>By common consent, the finest Cola masterpieces are the bronze images of Siva Nataraja.

=== Literature ===
{{Main| Chola literature}}

The age of the Imperial Cholas (850&ndash;1200) was the golden age of Tamil culture, marked by the importance of literature.<ref name=keay215/> Chola inscriptions cite many works, the majority of which have been lost.<ref name="lost">, including ''Rajarajesvara Natakam''- a work on drama, ''Viranukkaviyam'' by one Virasola Anukkar, and ''Kannivana Puranam'', a work of popular nature. [[K.A. Nilakanta Sastri]], ''The C<U+014D><U+013B>as'', pp 663&ndash;664</ref>

The revival of Hinduism from its nadir during the Kalabhras spurred the construction of numerous temples and these in turn generated Saiva and Vaishnava devotional literature.<ref>[[K.A. Nilakanta Sastri]], ''A History of South India'', p 333</ref> Jain and Buddhist authors flourished as well, although in fewer numbers than in previous centuries.<ref>[[K.A.

[[Kambar, Tamil|Kamban]] flourished during the reign of [[Kulothunga Chola III]].<ref name="kamban">[[K.A. Nilakanta Sastri]], ''The C<U+014D><U+013B>as'', p 672</ref> His ''[[Ramavataram|Ramavatharam]]'' (also referred to as ''Kambaramayanam'') is a great epic in Tamil literature, and although the author states that he followed [[Valmiki]]'s ''[[Ramayana]]'', it is generally accepted that his work is not a simple translation or adaptation of the Sanskrit epic: Kamban imports into his narration the colour and landscape of his own time; his description of [[Kosala]] is an idealised account of the features of the Chola country.<ref name=encyc1195/><ref>[[K.A.

Jayamkondar's masterpiece ''Kalingattuparani'' is an example of narrative poetry that draws a clear boundary between history and fictitious conventions. This describes the events during Kulothunga Chola I's war in Kalinga and depicts not only the pomp and circumstance of war, but the gruesome details of the field.<ref name=chopra116/><ref name=sastrip20>[[K.A.

The impulse to produce devotional religious literature continued into the Chola period and the arrangement of the [[Saiva]] canon into 11 books was the work of Nambi Andar Nambi, who lived close to the end of 10<sup>th</sup> century.<ref>[[K.A. Nilakanta Sastri]], ''A History of South India'', pp 342&ndash;343</ref><ref name=chopra115>Chopra ''et al.'', p 115</ref> However, relatively few [[Vaishnavite]] works were composed during the later Chola period, possibly because of the apparent animosity towards the Vaishnavites by the Later Chola monarchs.<ref name="vaishnava">[[K.A.

In general, Cholas were the adherents of [[Hinduism]]. Throughout their history, they were not swayed by the rise of Buddhism and [[Jainism]] as were the kings of the [[Pallava dynasty|Pallava]] and [[Pandya dynasty|Pandya]] dynasties. Even the early Cholas followed  a version of the classical Hindu faith. There is evidence in ''[[Purananuru]]'' for Karikala Chola's faith in the Vedic Hinduism in the Tamil country.<ref name="vedic">''Purananuru'' (poem 224) movingly expresses his faith and the grief caused by his passing away.</ref> Kocengannan, another early Chola, was celebrated in both Sangam literature and in the Saiva canon as a saint.<ref name=sastri116/>

While the Cholas did build their largest and most important temple dedicated to Lord Shiva, it can be by no means concluded that either they were staunch Saivites or followers of Saivism only or that they were not favourably disposed to other faiths. This is borne out by the fact that the second Chola king Aditya I himself built quite a few temples for Siva and for Lord Vishnu. In fact in AD 890, his inscriptions speak of his contributions to the construction of the Ranganatha Temple at Srirangapatnam (now in Mandya district of Karnataka) in the country of Western Gangas who were both his feudatories and also had marital relations with him. In fact during the time of Aditya I (871-903 AD) the Gangas of Kannada country had recognized his superiority which he acknowledged by marrying into that family and making grant contributions to the construction of the Sri Ranganatha temple at modern Srirangapatnam. Aditya I also regularly gave many endowments to the Sri Ranganatha Temple at Srirangam around AD 896 and also issued an inscriptional dictat pronouncing that both the great temples of Siva and the  Ranganatha  temple  at  Srirangam   to   be  the  'Kuladhanam'  of  the  Chola  emperors.<ref>http://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/darasuram/kulottunga.html</ref> In fact it was Aditya I's dictat which was faithfully carried out by his illustrious son Parantaka I and his successors wherein it was declared in edicts that the Siva Temple of Chidambaram (at that time the grand Siva temples of Tanjore and Gangaikonda Cholapuram were not in existence) and the Sri Ranganatha Swami temple of Srirangam were the 'Kuladhanams' i.e. tutelary (deities) treasures of the Chola emperors(***) In fact this dictat was repeated around 300 years back when the last great Chola King, Kulothunga III, the builder of the great Sarabeswarar Temple at Tribhuvanam on the outskirts of Kumbakonam, hails Lord Ranganatha at Srirangam in an inscription in the Srirangam Koil, as his 'tutelary deity' (***) As per findings of Dr. Hultzsch, the great epigraphist, in this very inscription acknowledgment is made to the earlier great Chola king Parantaka about declaring the Chidambaram (Siva) Koil and the Srirangam (Vishnu) Koil as 'Kuladhanams' of the Cholas, which is a pointer to the fact that the Cholas were secular and patronized equally all religions and sub-sects within the same religion(***) Another proof of this fact is the existence of as many as 40 Vaishnava Divyadesams out of 108 such temples in the Chola country, which are functioning and flourishing even today. In fact, Chola king Sundara (Parantaka-II) was a staunch devotee of the reclining Vishnu (Vadivu Azhagiya Nambi) at Anbil in the banks of Cauvery on the outskirts of Tiruchy, to whom he gave numerous gifts and embellishments, and prayed before him by keeping his sword before the deity, prior to his proceeding for war for regaining the territories in and around Kanchi and Arcot from the waning Rashtrakutas and while leading expeditions against both Madurai and Ilam (Sri Lanka)<ref name=tri480>Tripathi, p 480</ref>. [[Parantaka I]] and [[Parantaka Chola II|Sundara Chola]] endowed and built temples for both [[Siva]] and Vishnu.<ref>Vasudevan, p 102</ref> Rajaraja Chola I patronised Buddhists, and provided for the construction of the [[Chudamani Vihara]] (a Buddhist monastery) in [[Nagapattinam]] at the request of the Srivijaya Sailendra king.<ref name=asi3>''South Indian Inscriptions'', Vol 3</ref><ref name="sudamani">The name of the Sailendra king was Sri Chulamanivarman and the Vihara was named 'Chudamani vihara' in his honour. [[K.A. Nilakanta Sastri]], ''The C<U+014D><U+013B>as'', p 214</ref><ref>Keay, pp 222&ndash;223</ref><ref>Majumdar, p 406</ref> While it is true that the biggest and grandest temples of the Cholas were dedicated to Lord Siva, all Chola kings especially from Aditya to Rajendra IV not only built great temples for Lord Vishnu but also gave numerous grants and gifts to them (***) 

During the period of Later Cholas, there were assumed to be instances of intolerance towards [[Vaishnavites]],<ref>Stein, p 134</ref> especially towards [[Ramanuja]], the acharya of the Vaishnavites.<ref>Vasudevan, p 104</ref>  [[Kulothunga Chola II]], a staunch Saivite, is said to have removed a statue of Vishnu from the Siva temple at Chidambaram, though there are no epigraphical evidences to support this theory. There is an inscription from 1160 that the custodians of Siva temples who had social intercourses with Vaishnavites would forfeit their property. However, this is more of a direction to the Saivite community by its religious heads than any kind of dictat by a Chola emperor. While Chola kings indeed built their largest temples for Siva and even while emperors like Raja Raja Chola I held titles like 'Sivapadasekharan', in none of their inscriptions however, did the Chola emperors proclaim that their clan only and solely followed Saivism or that Saivism was the state religion during their rule.<ref>[[K.A. Nilakanta Sastri]], ''A History of South India'', p 176</ref><ref name="intolerance">[[K.A.Nilakanta Sastri]], ''The C<U+014D><U+013B>as'', p 645</ref><ref>Chopra ''et al.'', p 126</ref>

The history of the Chola dynasty has inspired many Tamil authors to produce literary and artistic creations during the last several decades.<ref>Das, p 108</ref> These works of popular literature have helped continue the memory of the great Cholas in the minds of the Tamil people. The most important work of this genre is the popular ''[[Ponniyin Selvan]]'' (The son of ''Ponni''), a historical novel in [[Tamil language|Tamil]] written by [[Kalki Krishnamurthy]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Versatile writer and patriot|author=|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/2001/03/20/stories/13200178.htm|publisher=The Hindu|accessdate=2008-05-29}}</ref> Written in five volumes, this narrates the story of Rajaraja Chola.<ref name=das109>Das, p 109</ref> ''Ponniyin Selvan'' deals with the events leading up to the ascension of [[Uttama Chola]] to the Chola throne. Kalki had utilised the confusion in the  succession to the Chola throne after the demise of Sundara Chola.<ref>Das, pp 108&ndash;109</ref> This book was serialised in the Tamil periodical ''[[Kalki (Tamil magazine)|Kalki]]'' during the mid 1950s.<ref>{{cite web|title=English translation of Ponniyin Selvan|author=|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/lr/2003/01/05/stories/2003010500100100.htm|publisher=The Hindu|accessdate=2008-05-29}}</ref> The serialisation lasted for nearly five years and every week its publication was awaited with great interest.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lines that Speak|author=|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/2001/07/23/stories/13230766.htm|publisher=The Hindu|accessdate=2008-05-29}}</ref> 

Kalki's earlier historical romance ''[[Parthiban Kanavu]]'' deals with the fortunes of an imaginary Chola prince Vikraman, who was supposed to have lived as a feudatory of the Pallava king [[Narasimhavarman I]] during the 7th century. The period of the story lies within the interregnum during which the Chola in eclipse before Vijayalaya Chola revived their fortunes.<ref name=das109/> ''Parthiban Kanavu'' was also serialised in the Kalki weekly during the early 1950s. 

[[Sandilyan]], another popular Tamil novelist, wrote ''Kadal Pura'' in the 1960s. It was serialised in the Tamil weekly [[Kumudam]]. ''Kadal Pura'' is set during the period when Kulothunga Chola I was in exile from the Vengi kingdom, after he was denied the throne. ''Kadal Pura'' speculates the whereabouts of Kulothunga during this period. Sandilyan's earlier work ''[[Yavana Rani]]'' written in the early 1960s is based on the life of Karikala Chola.<ref>''Encylopaedia of Indian literature, vol. 1'', pp 631&ndash;632</ref> More recently, [[Balakumaran]] wrote the novel ''[[Udaiyar]]'' based on the circumstances surrounding Rajaraja Chola's construction of the Brihadisvara Temple in Thanjavur.<ref>{{cite web|title=Book review of Udaiyar|author=|url=http://www.hindu.com/br/2005/02/22/stories/2005022200101501.htm|publisher=The Hindu|accessdate=2008-05-30}}</ref>

There were stage productions based on the life of Rajaraja Chola during the 1950s and in 1973, [[Shivaji Ganesan]] acted in a screen adaptation of this play titled ''[[Rajaraja Cholan]]''. The Cholas are featured in the [[History of the World (board game)|History of the World]] board game, produced by [[Avalon Hill]].
