St. Vrain started working for the [[United States government]] as an [[Bureau of Indian Affairs|Indian Agent]] in 1830.<ref name=mo/> He was assigned to the [[Sauk]] and [[Fox (tribe)|Fox]] nations around [[Rock Island, Illinois|Rock Island]] during [[William Clark (explorer)|William Clark]]'s tenure as superintendent of the St. Louis Indian Agency.<ref name=mo/>  St. Vrain was generally well received by the tribes in the area and was made an adopted brother by the Little Bear.<ref name=stevens/> When the [[Black Hawk War]] began, St. Vrain was stationed at [[Fort Armstrong]]. 

While on a mission to deliver dispatches from [[Dixon's Ferry]] (now [[Dixon, Illinois|Dixon]]) to [[Galena, Illinois|Galena]], under the command of General [[Henry Atkinson]], St. Vrain was brutally murdered along with three other members of his party on [[May 24]], 1832.
