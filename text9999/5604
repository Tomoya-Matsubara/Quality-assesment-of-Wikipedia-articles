'''Alexandra Caroline "Lexie" Grey''' is<!--Yes, "is", she is still a character from the show, even though she died--> a [[fictional character]] from the [[medical drama]] television series, ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'', which airs on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in the [[United States]]. The character was created by series' producer [[Shonda Rhimes]], and was portrayed by actress [[Chyler Leigh]] from the [[Grey's Anatomy (season 3)|third]] through [[Grey's Anatomy (season 8)|eighth]] seasons. She was introduced as a [[Surgery|surgical]] [[Internship (medicine)|intern]] in [[Grey's Anatomy (season 3)|season three]]. Serving as [[Meredith Grey]] ([[Ellen Pompeo]])'s half sister, she transferred to the fictional Seattle Grace Hospital, after her mother's sudden death. Eventually named a surgical [[Residency (medicine)|resident]], the character was originally contracted to appear for a multi-episode story arc, but received star billing in the [[Grey's Anatomy (season 4)|fourth season]].

The character's focal storyline involved a romantic relationship with plastic surgeon, [[Mark Sloan]] ([[Eric Dane]]). She sustained life-threatening injuries after an [[aviation accident]], which ultimately ended in her death. The character's death resulted in mixed critical feedback, and the reason given for the departure was Leigh's desire to spend more time with her family. Rhimes has characterized Lexie as being a dork, as well as having issues with saying how she feels. Leigh was among the cast to receive a [[Screen Actors Guild Award]] nomination for [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series|Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series]], in 2008. 

==Storylines==
Lexie Grey is the daughter of Thatcher Grey and his wife, Susan. She also has a younger sister, Molly Thompson, and her older half-sister is [[Meredith Grey]] ([[Ellen Pompeo]]), born to Thatcher and his first wife, Ellis. She graduated from [[Harvard Medical School]] before being accepted to Seattle Grace Hospital as an intern. The character's initial plans were to perform her internship at a different hospital, [[Mass General]], however, these changed when her mother died from sudden complications. She is introduced as [[Cristina Yang]] ([[Sandra Oh]])'s intern, who dubs her "three". When Meredith discovers that Lexie is her sister, she shows no desire to maintain a friendship, though the two eventually kindle a relationship. Lexie forms a friendship with fellow intern [[George O'Malley]] ([[T.R. Knight]]), and the two rent an apartment together. Furthermore, she later pursues a sexual relationship with resident [[Alex Karev]] ([[Justin Chambers]]). Lexie develops romantic feelings for O'Malley in the fifth season, however, he shows no interest in a romantic relationship, and their friendship dissolves. Lexie and fellow interns form a "medieval" medical teaching club, in the basement of the hospital, which leads to them all being placed on [[disciplinary probation]].

Lexie develops a romantic relationship with [[plastic surgery|plastic surgeon]] [[Mark Sloan (Grey's Anatomy)|Mark Sloan]] ([[Eric Dane]]), despite the efforts of Meredith and her husband, [[Derek Shepherd]] ([[Patrick Dempsey]]), as they feel he will hurt her. In the sixth season, O'Malley dies, after injuries sustained while being dragged by a bus, and Lexie receives comfort from Sloan, by moving in with him. Later in the season, Thatcher is admitted into the hospital, subsequently being diagnosed with [[Liver failure|liver failure]]<U+2014>a repercussion from his former [[Alcoholism|alcoholism]]. It is revealed that he needs an [[Organ transplant|organ transplant]], and Lexie offers to donate, but she is not a viable candidate. After constant pleads from Lexie, Meredith unwillingly agrees to donate her liver to Thatcher. In "Holidaze", Sloan's daughter shows up at their apartment, seeking kinship with him. His daughter soon announces her pregnancy, and Sloan offers shelter for her and the baby. However, when Lexie finds out, she is piqued that Sloan did not discuss this with her, and the two break up. On the spur of the moment, Lexie and Karev engage in sexual activity while his wife, [[Izzie Stevens]] ([[Katherine Heigl]]) is estranged, and the two form a relationship.

During the [[Sanctuary (Grey's Anatomy)|season six finale]], a grieving deceased patient's husband goes on a shooting rampage at the hospital, and shoots Karev. In the shooting's emotional reverberations, Lexie goes into a mental state, is admitted to the hospital's psychiatric facility, and gets sedated for fifty hours. Karev cannot deal with this, and ends his relationship with Lexie, leaving her enraged. Their breakup is followed by Lexie returning to Sloan, who condemned Karev for leaving her. However, Lexie later discovers that during their breakup, Sloan impregnated [[orthopedic surgery|orthopedic surgeon]] [[Callie Torres]] ([[Sara Ramirez]]), and she ends their relationship, again. In the aftermath of the breakup, Lexie agrees to a date with fellow resident, [[Jackson Avery]] ([[Jesse Williams]]), and the two entertain a brief relationship. In season eight, Lexie becomes jealous of Sloan's new girlfriend, Julia, which leads to Avery breaking up with her. Thereafter, Lexie confesses her undying love to Sloan, only to be ignored. In "[[Flight (Grey's Anatomy)|Flight]]", however, Lexie, Sloan, Meredith, Shepherd, Yang, and [[pediatric surgery|pediatric suregon]] [[Arizona Robbins]] ([[Jessica Capshaw]]), are involved in an [[aviation accident]], crushing Lexie under debris. It is revealed that Lexie is suffering from a [[hemothorax]], and that she will die. Sloan takes her by the hand, and tells her he will always love her, and that they were meant to be. Lexie subsequently succumbs to her injuries, and dies as Meredith is approaching.

Leigh first appeared on the show during the last two episodes of the third season as Meredith's half-sister, Lexie Grey. Following [[Isaiah Washington]]'s departure, who portrayed [[Preston Burke]], it was reported that show's executives were planning on adding new cast members, such as Lexie.<ref>{{cite web|title=Actors' exits leave 'Grey's' in recovery|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2007-06-10-greys-exits_N.htm|work=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=June 19, 2012|last1=Levin|first1=Gary|last2=Strauss|first2=Gary|date=June 11, 2012}}</ref> She was officially upgraded to a series' regular on July 11, 2007, for the fourth season.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ingrassia|first=Lisa|title=Grey's Anatomy Welcomes New Cast Member|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20045450,00.html|work=[[People (magazine){{!}}People]]|accessdate=June 19, 2012|date=July 11, 2007}}</ref> On casting Chyler Leigh as Lexie, ''Grey's Anatomy'' creator Shonda Rhimes said: "We met with a lot of young actresses, but Chyler stood out<U+2014>she had a quality that felt right and real to me.

In May 2012, Rhimes revealed why she decided to have Lexie die: "I love Chyler and I love the character of Lexie Grey. She was an important member of my Grey's family. This was not an easy decision. But it was a decision that Chyler and I came to together. We had a lot of thoughtful discussion about it and ultimately we both decided this was the right time for her character's journey to end.

Leigh's character has been called "reliable, trustworthy, timid, and apprehensive" by ''Grey's Anatomy'' executives.

Similarities have been established between Lexie and her half-sister, Meredith. Series writer, Stacy McKee, commented on this: {{quote|"Lexie<U+2019>s struggling to be hardcore herself.

Lexie entertained several relationships throughout her time on ''Grey's Anatomy''. In her early appearances, she maintained a friendship with George O'Malley, until developing romantic feelings towards him. Rhimes offered the insight: "I love them as friends. They make good friends. We all have that friend we met in school or the gym or somewhere <U+2013> we just hit it off right away. And right away there was no pretense or airs. Just pure honesty. That<U+2019>s Lexie and George. They<U+2019>re really good friends and I can see the friendship evolving into something even greater. At least, that<U+2019>s what Lexie is hoping.

Following her death, Rhimes said: {{cquote|Honestly, I always felt like Mark and Lexie were meant to be together. If things had not turned out the way they had this season, I had a completely different thing planned for them. I was one of the people who loved Mark and Lexie together.

I loved the idea of them together. They played really well together. They were very charming and funny and great. We did the scene where Lexie confesses to Mark that she's still in love with him.

==Reception==
The character's transition from season four to five has been positively reviewed, with Keen of ''The Trades'' writing: "Her presence and confidence have increased quite a bit since last season, and actress, Chyler Leigh, does a fantastic job of making this progression feel seamless. Since the series has defused the tension between Little Grey and Big Grey (aka Meredith), Lexie has clear sailing through the season and steals the show as one of the best current characters on the series."<ref name="DVD season 5"/>
