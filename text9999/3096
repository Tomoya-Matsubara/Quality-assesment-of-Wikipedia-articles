{{redirect|Doctor Who episodes|a list of the individual episode titles in the first three seasons|List of titled Doctor Who episodes}}
This is a '''list of ''[[Doctor Who]]'' television serials'''. Each [[Serial (radio and television)|serial]] up to 1989's ''[[Survival (Doctor Who)|Survival]]'', with the exception of [[Mission to the Unknown|one cutaway]] and [[The Five Doctors|one telemovie]], was a multi-episode story; the characters in the column after the serial titles indicate the code used by the production team to designate the serial (where applicable) and are followed by the number of episodes in the serial. Unless otherwise noted, episodes in this period are 25 minutes long. 
 
A number of serials from the 1960s are either [[Doctor Who missing episodes|missing]] or incomplete, while some of the episodes from the early 1970s are only held in black and white. See the [[list of incomplete Doctor Who serials]] for more details.
  
The three-digit story numbers are not official designations but are merely to serve as a guide to where the story stands in the overall context of the programme. There is some dispute about, for example, whether to count Season 23's ''[[The Trial of a Time Lord]]'' as one or four serials,<ref>{{cite web

|publisher = BBC ''Doctor Who'' website
}}</ref> The numbering scheme used here reflects that used in sources such as ''The Discontinuity Guide'', [[Outpost Gallifrey]] and DVD releases, which count ''Trial'' as four serials and include ''Shada''.
 
Starting with the 2005 revival, the production team abandoned the traditional serial format for a largely self-contained episodic format with occasional multi-part story and loose [[Story arcs in Doctor Who|story arcs]], similar to the style of American dramas such as ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' or ''[[The X-Files]]''. Unless otherwise noted, the new episodes are 45 minutes long. 
 
In the first two seasons and most of the third season, each episode of a serial has an [[List of titled Doctor Who episodes|individual title]]; no serial has an overall onscreen title until ''[[The Savages (Doctor Who)|The Savages]]''. However, the earlier stories are generally referred to by "umbrella" titles that are not used onscreen; much debate over these titles has ensued over the years, with different sources often using different titles for various reasons. The titles in this list are generally those used for commercial release.
 
During the early seasons of the programme most serials are linked together, one usually leading directly into the next <U+2014> although there are some breaks, such as between the second season finale, ''The Time Meddler'', and the third season premiere, ''Galaxy 4''.
{{TOClimit|limit=2}}

==First Doctor==
The [[First Doctor|first televised]] incarnation of [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|The Doctor]] was played by [[William Hartnell]]. During Hartnell's tenure, the Doctor visited a mixture of both stories set in the future and historical events that had no extraterrestrial influence, such as fifteenth century [[Mesoamerica]]. In his last story, ''[[The Tenth Planet]]'', the First Doctor gradually grew weaker until collapsing and regenerating at the end of episode four.

===Season 1 (1963-64)===
[[Verity Lambert]] was producer for the first season, and retained the position until "Mission to the Unknown". [[David Whitaker]] served as script editor until ''The Dalek Invasion of Earth''.

===Season 26 (1989)===
The final season continued to push the series towards a darker approach, focusing this time more on Ace's personal life as well as The Doctor's past and manipulations. This season sets the tone for the virgin [[New Adventures]] novels that follow, paving the way for future episodes based on the novels such as "[[Human Nature]]" and "[[The Family of Blood]]".

The [[Eighth Doctor]] was played by [[Paul McGann]]. The movie is the first and only television appearance of this Doctor. The only production title held by this story was ''Doctor Who''. However, producer [[Philip Segal]] later suggested ''Enemy Within'' as an alternative title. Lacking any other specific name, many fans have adopted this to refer to the movie. Fan groups have also used other informal titles. The DVD release is titled ''Doctor Who: The Movie''.

==Ninth Doctor==
In 2005, the BBC relaunched ''[[Doctor Who]]'' after a 16-year absence from episodic television, with  [[Russell T. Davies]], [[Julie Gardner]] and [[Mal Young]] as executive producers, [[Phil Collinson]] as producer, and [[Christopher Eccleston]] taking the lead role of the [[Ninth Doctor]]. Although the production team chose to restart the series numbering from scratch, some fans of the programme prefer to refer to the 2005 series as Season 27, the 2006 series as Season 28, and so on. Despite the new numbering, the revival adheres to the original continuity. The new series is formatted to a [[16:9]] [[widescreen]] display ratio, and a standard episode length of 45 minutes. For the first time since the 1965<U+2013>'66 season, each episode has an individual title even though some stories span several episodes.
 
===Series 1 (2005)=== <!-- Do not change this to 27 season. Thank you.--> 
The 2005 series constitutes a loose story arc, dealing with the consequences of the [[Time War (Doctor Who)|Time War]] and the mysterious [[Bad Wolf references in Doctor Who|Bad Wolf]].

=====Fire on the set=====
<!--Please don't add rumours from tabloid newspapers. They aren't reliable, and will probably be removed.-->

In August 2007, media reported that filming for a Roman-themed ''Doctor Who'' episode had been interrupted by a fire in Rome's [[Cinecitta|Cinecitt<U+00E0>]], on sets previously used for the filming of the [[HBO]]/[[BBC]] TV series ''[[Rome (TV series)|Rome]]''.<ref name="DigitalSpy">{{cite news

==Other stories==
 
===TV broadcasts===
There have also been several special ''Doctor Who'' episodes and serials that are produced by the BBC, but are not generally considered part of the series continuity. They usually consist of [[Parody|spoofs]] and [[Fictional crossover|crossovers]] with other TV shows, and stories produced for special occasions.
 
* "[[A Fix with Sontarans]]" (1985) - segment of ''[[Jim'll Fix It]]'' starring Colin Baker as the Sixth Doctor and [[Janet Fielding]] as [[Tegan Jovanka]].
* ''[[Dimensions in Time]]'' (1993) - [[Children in Need]] 30th anniversary program for Doctor Who and also crossover with ''[[EastEnders]]'', starring Jon Pertwee, Tom Baker, Peter Davison, Colin Baker and Sylvester McCoy, with many companions returning.  
* ''[[Doctor Who and the Curse of Fatal Death]]'' (1999) - [[Comic Relief (charity)|Comic Relief]] spoof, starring [[Rowan Atkinson]].
 
===Webcasts===
* ''[[Death Comes to Time]]'' (2001) - [[webcast]] for [[BBCi]] featuring the Seventh Doctor.
* ''[[Real Time (Doctor Who)|Real Time]]'' (2002) - webcast for BBCi featuring the Sixth Doctor.
* ''[[Shada]]'' (2003) - webcast for BBCi featuring the Eighth Doctor; remake of the unfinished Fourth Doctor serial.
* ''[[Scream of the Shalka]]'' (2003) - Animated webcast for BBCi featuring an alternative version of the Ninth Doctor known as the [[Shalka Doctor]], played by [[Richard E. Grant]].
 
Some of the webcast productions were produced by [[Big Finish Productions]] but first aired on the BBC's website before release in other media; none were live-action productions, but instead used limited animation and illustrations, with ''Scream of the Shalka'' being more fully animated than the others.
 
The BBC has also commissioned and broadcast several radio serials based upon the series (see [[Doctor Who audio productions]]), most recently a series of productions for [[BBC7]] starring Paul McGann.
 
==Notes==
{{refbegin}}
* {{endnote|giants|a}} Webber's script for the originally intended opening episode for the first story ''The Giants'' was a basis for the opening episode, but Webber didn't work with Coburn on the script.
* {{endnote|overall|b}} From this point on, the stories (not the episodes) all have on-screen serial titles. For the 2005 revival, episode titles are used, even for most multi-episode tales, although the majority of stories are told in a single episode.
* {{endnote|The Three Doctors|c}} ''The Three Doctors'' was a tenth anniversary serial. 
* {{endnote|invasion|d}} The first episode lists the serial's name as simply ''Invasion'', ostensibly to conceal the surprise ending to that episode.
* {{endnote|shada|e}} ''Shada'' was left unfinished due to a strike.  Its recorded footage was later released on [[home video]] using linking narration by Tom Baker to complete the story.
* {{endnote|5doctors|f}} ''The Five Doctors'' is considered part of the 20th season, although it was broadcast only a few weeks before the start of Season 21. ''The Five Doctors'' was re-edited into four 25-minute episodes for syndication, but the 90-minute special remained more frequently shown, until it was supplanted by 1995's [[The Five Doctors#Broadcast, VHS and DVD releases|"Special Edition"]] re-edit, c. 2000.
