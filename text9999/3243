Colonel '''Sir Charles Edward Howard Vincent''' [[Order of St Michael and St George|KCMG]] [[Order of the Bath|CB]] [[Deputy Lieutenant|DL]] (31 May 1849 &ndash; 7 April 1908), known as '''Howard Vincent''' or '''C. E. Howard Vincent''', was a [[United Kingdom|British]] soldier, [[barrister]], [[police]] official and [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] politician who sat in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] from 1885 to 1908.

==Early life and education==
Vincent was born in [[Slinfold]], near [[Horsham]] in [[Sussex]], the second son of [[Sir Frederick Vincent, 11th Baronet]], the village's [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]]. His brothers included [[Sir William Vincent, 12th Baronet]], [[Claude Vincent]], who became an administrator in [[India]], and the financier and diplomat [[Edgar Vincent, 1st Viscount D'Abernon]].

He was educated at [[Westminster School]] and in November 1866 entered the [[Royal Military College, Sandhurst]].<ref name=Debrett>[http://www.archive.org/stream/debrettshouseo1886londuoft Debretts Guide to the House of Commons 1886]</ref>  Passing out in 1868, he [[Sale of commissions|purchased a commission]] in the [[23rd Foot]] (later the [[Royal Welch Fusiliers]]).<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=23402|startpage=4063|date=21 July 1868|accessdate=2008-02-11}}</ref> He was promoted [[Lieutenant]] in 1871.<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=23812|startpage=5868|endpage=5870|date=29 December 1871|accessdate=2008-02-11}}</ref><ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=23876|startpage=3197|endpage=3199|date=16 July 1872|accessdate=2008-02-11}}</ref> In 1871, he served as a correspondent with the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' in [[Berlin]] and then went on to [[Russia]] to learn the language and study the country's military organisation. In 1872 he began to write articles and lecture at the [[Royal United Services Institution]]. After his regiment was posted to [[Ireland]] later that year, he began to address political meetings on the [[Irish question]], expressing generally [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] views. 

On 3 May 1873, Vincent enrolled as a pupil barrister at the [[Inner Temple]]. In that and the following year he travelled to [[Turkey]] and again to Russia, learning [[Turkish language|Turkish]] (to add to [[Russian language|Russian]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]] and [[Italian language|Italian]], which he already knew). He also became an expert on the politics of the [[Near East]]. In 1874, he was commissioned into the [[Royal Berkshire Militia]] as a [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|Captain]].<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=24033|startpage=4906|date=11 November 1873|accessdate=2008-02-11}}</ref> He resigned his commission in November 1875,<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=24264|startpage=5306|date=9 November 1875|accessdate=2008-02-11}}</ref> but a month later was appointed [[Lieutenant-Colonel (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant-Colonel]] commanding the 40th Middlesex Rifle Volunteer Corps (Central London Rangers),<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=24274|startpage=6355|date=10 December 1875|accessdate=2008-02-11}}</ref> again resigning his commission in 1878.<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=24581|startpage=3048|date=14 May 1878|accessdate=2008-02-11}}</ref> He continued to write on political and military matters.

==Lawyer, soldier and policeman==
[[File:Howard Vincent, Vanity Fair, 1883-12-22.jpg|thumb|Caricature by [[Leslie Ward|Spy]] published in [[Vanity Fair (British magazine 1868-1914)|Vanity Fair]] in 1883.]]
He was [[called to the bar]] on 20 January 1876<ref name=Debrett/>  and joined the South-Eastern [[Circuit court|Circuit]] in the [[Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Division]], although he never really devoted himself to the law. On the outbreak of the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877<U+2013>1878)|Russo-Turkish War]] in 1877, the ''Daily Telegraph'' sent him to report on the [[Imperial Russian Army|Russian Army]], but he was refused permission to accompany the army into the field, as the Russians were suspicious that he spoke Russian and suspected him of being a Turkish sympathiser.

In 1877 he enrolled as a student at the [[Facult<U+00E9> de Droit]] in [[Paris]] and investigated the [[Prefecture of Police|Parisian police]]. When, later that year, the Metropolitan Police Detective Branch was hit by a scandal in which several senior officers were dismissed, Vincent was asked to report on the Paris detective system. This so impressed [[R. A. Cross]], the [[Home Secretary]], that in 1878 he was appointed to the new post of Director of Criminal Investigation to head the new [[Criminal Investigation Department]].<ref name=Debrett/> Although without the official status of [[Assistant Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis|Assistant Commissioner]], this post was equivalent to the two Assistant Commissioners in almost every way. Vincent answered directly to the Home Secretary and not to the [[Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis|Commissioner]], which put him in a rather strange position, as his deputy, [[Adolphus Williamson]], and his men did answer to the Commissioner (luckily Vincent and Commissioner [[Edmund Henderson|Sir Edmund Henderson]] had a good relationship). Vincent completely reorganised the department. From 1883 he also edited the ''[[Police Gazette]]''.

In 1884, however, realising that his police post offered little chance of further advancement, he resigned to enter politics. That year he was also appointed [[Lieutenant-Colonel]] commanding the [[Queen's Westminsters|Queen's Westminster Volunteers]],<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=25322|startpage=970|date=26 February 1884|accessdate=2008-02-11}}</ref> holding the post for twenty years until 1904. He was rewarded for his police service by being appointed [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] (CB) in 1885.

==Politician==

Vincent went on a world tour, in which he was so impressed with the effects of [[British Empire|imperialism]] that he decided to stand for the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] (although he had previously tended towards Liberalism). At the [[United Kingdom general election, 1885|general election in November 1885]] he defeated [[Samuel Plimsoll]] to win the constituency of [[Sheffield Central (UK Parliament constituency)|Sheffield Central]].<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=25541|startpage=6137|date=18 December 1885|accessdate=2008-02-11}}</ref> He remained in Parliament until his death, being returned unopposed in 1895 and 1900, although he had to win the elections of 1886, 1892 and 1906.<ref name="craig1885-1918">{{cite book

Vincent was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] in 1896<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=26706|startpage=645|date=4 February 1896|accessdate=2008-02-11}}</ref> and appointed [[Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George]] (KCMG) in 1898 for his service as British delegate to a conference on [[anarchist]]s in [[Rome]].<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=27091|startpage=3865|date=20 June 1899|accessdate=2008-02-11}}</ref> He was selected to command the infantry of the [[City Imperial Volunteers]] in the [[Second Boer War]], but was eventually refused permission to go due to a heart problem.
