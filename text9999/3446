==Early life==
Lees was born in Hucknall, in Nottinghamshire.<ref name="BBCPrisonToRole"/> Lees was brought up as a boy, and self-identified as gay in early adulthood. At the age of 16 Lees committed a robbery, for which she served eight months in prison when she was 18. She later said "I had dropped out of college. Basically, I had gone off the rails because I was terrified of going to prison. I ended up taking lots of drugs."<ref name="BBCPrisonToRole"/> While in prison Lees decided to change: "I just thought, 'I'm this silly teenage boy in a prison cell who has made a huge mistake and I want to be this happy person'."<ref name="BBCPrisonToRole"/> Lees moved to Brighton to study English at university, where she started to identify as female: "In the space of six weeks I went from living in Nottingham as a boy with my grandma still alive, to living in Brighton as a girl".<ref name="BBCPrisonToRole"/> She was referred to Charing Cross Gender Identity Clinic where she received hormone treatment to begin gender transition.

== Journalism and presenting ==
Lees founded the first British magazine aimed at the [[transgender|trans]] community, ''META'',<ref name="BBCPrisonToRole"/><ref name="Diversity2012"/> and was the acting assistant editor of ''[[Gay Times]]''.<ref name="GuardianProfile"/> She also has columns in both ''Gay Times'' and ''[[Diva (magazine)|Diva]]'',<ref name="IndependentProfile"/> and was the first trans [[cover girl]] for ''Diva''.<ref name="BBCPrisonToRole"/><ref name="PinkList2013"/>

Lees has also written for mainstream newspapers and magazines, including ''[[The Independent]]'', ''[[The Guardian]]'', ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', ''The Sun'' and ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]'',<ref name="GuardianProfile"/><ref name="IndependentProfile"/><ref name="Vice"/><ref name="TelegraphNationalSport"/> as well as for [[Channel 4 News]].<ref name="C4Reed"/>

Lees has presented on both television and radio, being the first [[trans woman]] presenter on both [[BBC Radio 1]] and [[Channel 4]].<ref name="BBCPrisonToRole"/><ref name="PinkList2013"/> On Radio 1, she produced a documentary entitled "The Hate Debate" for ''BBC Radio 1's Stories'' which covered the attitudes people have to minority groups and covered issues related to [[racism]], [[homophobia]], [[transphobia]] and [[Islamophobia]].<ref name="TelegraphNationalSport"/> "The Hate Debate" received BBC Radio 4's Pick of the Week,<ref name="R4PotW"/> with critics praising her for doing "a fine job of provoking her listeners" and for seeming "genuinely interested in the opinions of the young people she interviewed."<ref name="GuardianR1Stories"/> The Hate Debate was followed up with a second documentary in the same slot, "My Transgender Punk Rock Story", interviewing transgender rock star [[Laura Jane Grace]] and introducing the teenage audience to trans concepts of identity both within and outside of the binary. She also presented the episode "Trans" of Channel 4's ''The Shooting Gallery''.<ref name="C4Shooting"/>

On 25 October 2013 Lees took part as a panellist in the BBC's [[100 Women (BBC)|100 Women]] event.<ref name="100women"/>

On 31 October 2013 Lees became the first openly transgender panellist to appear on the BBC's ''[[Question Time (TV series)|Question Time]]'' programme, drawing praise from commentators who included former Deputy Prime Minister [[John Prescott]] and the Labour Party deputy leader [[Harriet Harman]].<ref name="PNQTDebut"/>

Lees will be a judge at this year's [[Stonewall Awards]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/Paris.Lees.Activist.Journalist.Optimist/photos/a.164252423666232.38714.144296638995144/675770469181089/?type=1&source=46|website=Facebook|accessdate=15 August 2014}}</ref>

== Activism ==
Lees, working with [[Trans Media Watch]], challenged [[Channel 4]] to remove [[transphobia|transphobic]] material from its broadcasts,<ref name="NSRoleModels"/> and consulted with the channel for its documentary ''[[My Transsexual Summer]]''.<ref name="NSJacquesSummer"/><ref name="PNMeta"/> She has worked with a number of media outlets to provide guidance on covering transgender people; in its 2013 Pink List award coverage, ''[[The Independent on Sunday]]'' said "It was noted by our judges that the ''[[Daily Mail]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s coverage of trans issues has improved noticeably since she had lunch with its managing editor."<ref name="PinkList2013"/>

Lees currently works with [[All About Trans]], a project that tries to bring together journalists and other media professionals with transgender people.<ref name="BBCPrisonToRole"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.allabouttrans.org.uk/about/|title=About|work=All About Trans|accessdate=27 October 2013}}</ref>

In 2013, Lees topped ''[[The Independent on Sunday]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Pink List, naming her as the most influential lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender figure in the UK; she was a judge for that award in 2011 and 2012.<ref name="BBCPrisonToRole"/><ref name="PinkList2013"/>

Lees has said that [[social media]] is a key tool for transgender people to improve their societal recognition:

{{Quotation|People have been taking the piss out of trans people for 60 years. The narrative on trans issues has been controlled by people who have no understanding of them. Social media is about us grabbing the narrative back and telling our own stories <U+2013> this is our reality, this is what we go through and this is what matters to us. We're here, we're in your face, we definitely exist. That's the most important thing <U+2013> realising we exist.<ref name="GuardianVoices">{{Cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/jan/22/voices-from-trans-community-prejudice|title=Voices from the trans community: 'There will always be prejudice'|first=Patrick|last=Barkham|work=The Guardian|date=22 January 2013|accessdate=27 October 2013}}</ref>}}

Lees also expressed objections to "#fuckcispeople", a controversial trending [[hashtag]] on the social networking site [[Twitter]], which she thought was counterproductive: "It is much better to engage in a positive dialogue than through angry abuse."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2013/08/16/prominent-trans-campaigners-condemn-use-of-fckcispeople-in-twitter-argument/|title=Prominent trans campaigners condemn use of #fuckcispeople in Twitter argument|first=Joseph Patrick|last=McCormick|work=[[Pink News]]|date=16 August 2013|accessdate=27 October 2013}}</ref>

== Personal life and identity ==
Lees has publicly identified herself as a [[bisexual]] [[trans woman]] and as a [[feminism|feminist]].<ref name="TelegraphNationalSport"/><ref name="GuardianTransFeminist"/> Lees has written about how in the early days of her gender transition she received abuse for not [[Passing (gender)|passing]].<ref name="GuardianVoices" />

In response to the announced gender transition of [[Chelsea Manning]], Lees revealed that as a teenager and before her transition, she had gone to prison for [[robbery]]. Lees<U+2014>who then was living as an effeminate gay male<U+2014>said of the experience that "looking like a girly boy in an institute full of rough lads wasn't a barrel of laughs", but that prison was less violent than school was because other prisoners were more disposed to harming themselves than others.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/23/chelsea-manning-transgender-prison-paris-lees|title='I hope Chelsea Manning gets the help she needs': Paris Lees, transgender former prisoner, on life inside|first=Paris|last=Lees|work=The Guardian|date=23 August 2013|accessdate=27 October 2013}}</ref> After her release from prison and being turned down for a part-time job answering phones, Lees described having an epiphany: "When I realised I would like to change society, not myself, all these good things have come into my life."<ref name="BBCPrisonToRole"/> She subsequently received a referral to [[Charing Cross Hospital]]'s gender identity clinic, and met her boyfriend shortly after beginning [[hormone replacement therapy (male-to-female)|hormone replacement therapy]].<ref name="BBCPrisonToRole"/>
