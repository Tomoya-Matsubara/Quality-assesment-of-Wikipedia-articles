According to the [[IUPAC]] terminology, the '''lanthanoid''' (previously '''lanthanide''') series comprises the fifteen [[chemical element|element]]s with [[atomic number]]s 57 through 71, from [[lanthanum]] to [[lutetium]].<ref>[http://www.iupac.org/reports/periodic_table IUPAC Periodic Table]</ref><ref> [http://www.iupac.org/reports/periodic_table/IUPAC_Periodic_Table-22Jun07b.pdf IUPAC Periodic Table 2007 .pdf]</ref>  All lanthanoids are [[f-block]] elements, corresponding to the filling of the 4f electron shell, except for lutetium which is a [[d-block]] lanthanoid. The lanthanoid series ('''Ln''') is named after lanthanum.

==Terminology==
The [[trivial name]] "[[rare earths]]" is sometimes used to describe all the lanthanoids together with [[scandium]] and [[yttrium]]. The term "rare earths" arises from the minerals from which they were isolated, which were uncommon oxide-type minerals. The use of this name is deprecated by [[IUPAC]], as they are neither rare in abundance nor "earths" (an obsolete term for water-insoluble strongly basic [[oxide]]s of electropositive metals incapable of being smelted into metal using late 18th century technology) {{Fact|date=April 2008}}. These elements are in fact fairly abundant in nature, although rare as compared to the "common" earths such as lime or magnesia. [[Cerium]] is the 26th most abundant element in the Earth's crust, [[neodymium]] is more abundant than [[gold]] and even [[thulium]] (the least common naturally-occurring lanthanoid) is more abundant than [[iodine]].<ref name=aspinali/> Despite their abundance, even the technical term "lanthanoids" could be interpreted to reflect a sense of elusiveness on the part of these elements, as it comes from the Greek <U+03BB><U+03B1><U+03BD><U+03B8><U+03B1><U+03BD><U+03B5><U+03B9><U+03BD> (''lanthanein''), "to lie hidden". However, if not referring to their natural abundance, but rather to their property of "hiding" behind each other in minerals, this interpretation is in fact appropriate. The etymology of the term must be sought in the first discovery of [[lanthanum]], at that time a so-called new rare earth element "lying hidden" in a [[cerium]] mineral, but we might call it a fortunate twist of irony that exactly lanthanum was later identified as the first in an entire series of chemically similar elements and could give name to the whole series.

IUPAC currently recommends the name '''lanthanoid''' rather than lanthanide, as the suffix "-ide" generally indicates negative [[ion]]s whereas the suffix "-oid" indicates similarity to one of the members of the containing family of elements. In the older literature, the name "lanthanon" was often used.

There are alternative arrangements of the periodic table that exclude lanthanum or lutetium from appearing together with the other lanthanoids.

== Chemistry ==

Lanthanoids are chemically similar to each other. Useful comparison can also be made with the [[actinoids]], where the 5f shell is partially filled.  The lanthanoids are typically placed below the main body of the periodic table in the manner of a footnote. The [[Periodic table (wide)|full-width version of the periodic table]] shows the position of the lanthanoids more clearly.

The [[ionic radius|ionic radii]] of the lanthanoids decrease through the period &mdash; the so-called [[lanthanide contraction]].  Except for cerium (III and IV) and europium (III and II), the lanthanoids occur as [[Valence (chemistry)|trivalent]] [[Ion#Ions|cations]] in nature.  As a consequence, their geochemical behaviors are a regular function of ionic radius and, therefore, atomic number.  This property results in variations in the abundances of lanthanoids that trace natural materials through physical and chemical processes.  In addition, three of the lanthanoids have radioactive isotopes with long half-lives (<sup>138</sup>La, <sup>147</sup>Sm and <sup>176</sup>Lu)<ref>There exist other naturally occurred radioactive isotopes of lantanoids with long half-lives (<sup>144</sup>Nd, <sup>150</sup>Nd, <sup>148</sup>Sm, <sup>151</sup>Eu, <sup>152</sup>Gd) but they are not used as chronometers.</ref> that date minerals and rocks from Earth, the Moon and meteorites. The lanthanoid contraction is responsible for the great geochemical divide that splits the lanthanoids into light and heavy-lanthanoid enriched minerals, the latter being almost inevitably associated with and dominated by yttrium.  This divide is reflected in the first two "rare earths" that were discovered: [[Yttrium(III) oxide|yttria]] (1794) and [[Cerium(IV) oxide|ceria]] (1803). The divide is driven by the decrease in coordination number as the ionic radius shrinks, and is dramatically illustrated by the two [[anhydrous]] phosphate minerals, [[monazite]] (monoclinic) and [[xenotime]] (tetragonal).  The geochemical divide has put more of the light lanthanoids in the Earth's crust, but more of the heavies in the Earth's mantle.  The result is that although large rich orebodies are found that are enriched in the light lanthanoids, correspondingly large orebodies for the heavies are few. The lanthanoids obey the [[Oddo-Harkins rule]] - odd-numbered elements are less abundant than their even-numbered neighbors.

Due to their specific electronic configurations, lanthanoid atoms tend to lose three electrons, usually 5d<sup>1</sup> and 6s<sup>2</sup>, to attain their most stable oxidation state as trivalent ions.

The lanthanoid trivalent cations feature a [[Xenon]]-core electronic configuration with the addition of <em>n</em> 4f electrons, with <em>n</em> varying from 0 [for La(III)] to 14 [for Lu(III)]. This 4f<sup><em>n</em></sup> sub-shell lies inside the ion, shielded by the 5s<sup>2</sup> and 5p<sup>6</sup> closed sub-shells. Thus, lanthanoid trivalent cations are sometimes referred to as <U+201C>triple-positively charged noble gases<U+201D>.

The contracted nature of the 4f orbitals and their small overlap with the ligand atom orbitals attaches a predominantly ionic character to lanthanoid-ligand atom bonds in complexes. Thus, the mainly electrostatic interactions between the lanthanoid trivalent cation and the atoms of the ligands result in irregular geometric arrangements and a handful of high coordination numbers. Indeed, this triple-positively charged [[closed shell]] inert gas electron density characteristic is the foundation of the [http://www.sparkle.pro.br lanthanide Sparkle Model], used in the computational chemistry of lanthanoid complexes.

Several properties, such as ionization energies, optical properties, magnetic moments and geometries of complexes, etc., serve as proof that the 4f orbitals are indeed wholly shielded from ligand effects.

All lanthanoids closely resemble lanthanum.  They are [[electropositive]] trivalent metals.  They are shiny and silvery-white, and tarnish easily when exposed to air.  They react violently with most nonmetals. They are relatively soft but their hardness increases with their atomic number.  Lanthanoids [[Oxidation|burn]] in air.  They have high [[Melting point|melting]] and [[boiling point]]s.

==Biological effects==
Lanthanoids entering the human body due to exposure to various industrial processes can affect metabolic processes. Trivalent lanthanoid ions, especially La<sup>3+</sup> and Gd<sup>3+</sup>, can interfere with [[calcium channel]]s in human and animal cells. Lanthanoids can also alter or even inhibit the action of various [[enzyme]]s. Lanthanoid ions found in [[neuron]]s can regulate synaptic transmission, as well as block some receptors (for example, [[glutamate]] receptors).<ref name="Artur">Artur Palasz, Piotr Czekaj, ''Toxicological and Cytophysiological Aspects of Lanthanides'', Acta Biochima Polonica 47: No.4/2000</ref>

Most lanthanoids are widely used in [[laser]]s. These elements deflect [[ultraviolet]] and [[infrared]] radiation and are commonly used in the production of sunglass lenses. Other applications are summarized in the following table:

== Mnemonics ==
To remember the sequence of the lanthanoid elements, various [[mnemonic]] phrases have been used. One is:
