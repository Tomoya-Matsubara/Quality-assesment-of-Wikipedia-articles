'''Kosa Pan''' was a [[Siamese]] [[diplomat]] and [[minister]], who led an embassy to [[France]] sent by king [[Narai]] in 1686.

Kosa Pan left for France in 1686, accompanying the return of the 1685 French embassy to Siam of [[Chevalier de Chaumont]] and [[Fran<U+00E7>ois-Timol<U+00E9>on de Choisy]] on two French ships.<ref>Gunn, p.188</ref> The embassy was bringing a proposal for an eternal alliance between France and Siam and stayed in France from June 1686 to March 1687. Kosa Pan was accompanied by the Jesuit [[Guy Tachard]].

Kosa Pan's embassy was met with a rapturous reception and caused a sensation in the courts and society of Europe.  The mission landed at the French port of [[Brest, France|Brest]] before continuing its journey to [[Versailles]], constantly surrounded by crowds of curious onlookers.

The "exotic" clothes as well as manners of the envoys (including their [[kowtow|kowtowing]] to [[Louis XIV]] during their visit to him on September 1, 1686), together with a special "machine" that was used to carry King Narai's missive to the French monarch caused much comment in French high society. Kosa Pan's great interest in French maps and images was commented upon in a contemporary issue of the ''Mercure Galant''.<ref>Suarez, p.29 [http://books.google.com/books?id=ZG7ZMAbv_jAC&pg=PA29&dq=Kosa+Pan&sig=V7XfqARcvbbkzIzM3-Yt1UpuZxs#PPA29,M1]</ref>

A fragmentary Siamese account of the mission compiled by Kosa Pan was re-discovered in Paris in the 1980s.<ref>{{cite book | author=Smithies, M. | coauthors=Cruysse, Dirk van der  | title=The Diary of Kosa Pan: Thai Ambassador to France, June-July 1686 | publisher=University of Washington Press | location=Seattle | year=2002}}</ref> The embassy's encounter with [[Louis XIV]] is depicted in numerous paintings of the period.

The embassy of Kosa Pan was soon followed by another one, led by [[Ok-khun Chamnan]].

Upon his return to [[Siam]], Kosa Pan became Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade (''Phra klang'') under the new ruler [[Petracha]]. Kosa Pan is known to have been met in [[Thailand]] in 1690 by the Dutch diplomat [[Engelbert Kaempfer]], who described "pictures of the Royal familly of France and European maps" hanging "in the hall of his house".<ref>Suarez, p.30</ref>
