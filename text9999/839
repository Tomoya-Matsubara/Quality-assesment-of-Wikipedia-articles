'''Akhtar Hameed Khan''' ([[15 July]] [[1914]] &ndash; [[9 October]] [[1999]]) was a [[:Category:Development|development]] activist and [[social scientist]] credited for pioneering [[microcredit]] and [[microfinance]] initiatives, farmers' [[cooperatives]], and [[rural]] training programmes in the [[developing world]]. He promoted participatory [[rural development]] in [[Pakistan]], [[Bangladesh]] and other developing countries, and widely advocated community participation in development. His particular contribution was the establishment of a comprehensive project for rural development, the [[Comilla Model]] (1959). It earned him the [[Magsaysay Award]] from the [[Philippines]] and an honorary [[Doctorate of law|Doctorate of Law]] from [[Michigan State University]]. In the 1980s he started a [[Bottom Up|bottom up]] [[community development]] initiative of [[Orangi Pilot Project]], based in the outskirts of [[Karachi]], which became a model of participatory development initiatives. He also directed many programmes, from microcredit to self-finance and from housing provision to [[family planning]], for rural communities and urban slums. It earned him international recognition and [[Civil decorations of Pakistan|high honours]] in Pakistan. Khan was fluent in at least seven languages and dialects. Apart from many scholarly books and articles, he also published a collection of poems and [[Travel literature|travelogues]] in [[Urdu]].

== Early life ==
Khan was born on [[15 July]] [[1914]] in [[Agra]]. He was among the four sons and three daughters of Anis Ahmed Khan and Mehmoodah Begum.<ref>Yousaf (2003), p. 338.</ref>  His father, a [[police inspector]], was inspired by the reformist thinking of [[Syed Ahmed Khan]]. In his early age, Khan's mother introduced him to the poetry of [[Maulana Hali]] and [[Muhammad Iqbal]], the [[sermon]]s of [[Abul Kalam Azad]], and the [[Sufi]]st philosophy of [[Rumi]]. This upbringing influenced his interest in historical as well as contemporary social, economic, and political affairs.<ref>Hasan (1996), pp. xiii<U+2013>xiv.</ref>

Khan attended Government High School at Jalam ([[Uttar Pradesh]]), and completed his education in 1930 at Agra College where he studied English literature and history. He read English literature, history, and philosophy for a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree at Meerut College in 1932. At that point, his mother was diagnosed with [[tuberculosis]]. She died in the same year at the age of 36.<ref>Yousaf (2003), pp. 339<U+2013>340.</ref> Khan continued his studies and was awarded a [[Master of Arts]] in English Literature from [[Agra University]] in 1934. He worked as a lecturer at Meerut College before joining the [[Indian Civil Service]] (ICS) in 1936.<ref>Yousaf (2003), p. 345.</ref> As part of the ICS training, he was sent to read literature and history at [[Magdalene College, Cambridge]], England. During the stay, he developed close friendship with [[Choudhary Rahmat Ali]].<ref>Yousaf (2003), p. 346.</ref>

Khan married Hameedah Begum (the eldest daughter of [[Allama Mashriqi]]) in 1940. Together, they had three daughters (Mariam, Amina, and Rasheeda) and a son (Akbar). After Hameedah Begum's death in 1966, he married Shafiq Khan and had one daughter, Ayesha.<ref>Yousaf (2003), pp. 342<U+2013>43.</ref> During his ICS career, Khan worked as [[District collector|collector]] of [[revenue]], a position that brought him into regular contact with living conditions in rural areas of [[East Bengal]].<ref>Yousaf (2003), p. 347.</ref> The [[Bengal famine of 1943]] and subsequent inadequate handling of the situation by the colonial rulers led him to resign from the Indian Civil Service in 1945. He wrote, "I realised that if I did not escape while I was young and vigorous, I will forever remain in the trap, and terminate as a bureaucratic big wig."<ref>BARD (1983), p. xii.</ref> During this period, he was influenced by the philosophy of [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzche]] and [[Allama Mashriqi|Mashriqi]], and joined the [[Khaksars|Khaksar Movement]]. This attachment was brief. He quit the movement and turned to [[Sufism]].<ref>Hussain, I (2006). ''[http://www.dawn.com/weekly/dmag/archive/061224/dmag14.htm A cause worth serving]''. ''DAWN Magazine''. [[24 December]]. Retrieved on [[25 April]] [[2008]].</ref> According to Khan, "I had a profound personal concern; I wanted to live a life free from fear and anxiety, a calm and serene life, without turmoil and conflict.&nbsp;[...]&nbsp;when I followed the advice of old Sufis and sages, and tried to curb my greed, my pride and aggression, fears, anxieties and conflict diminished."<ref>Khan (1996), p. 23.</ref>

For the next two years, Khan worked in Mamoola village near [[Aligarh]] as a labourer and [[locksmith]], an experience that provided him with firsthand knowledge of the problems and issues of rural communities. In 1947, he took up a teaching position at the [[Jamia Millia Islamia|Jamia Millia, Delhi]], where he worked for three years. In 1950, Khan migrated from  [[Union of India|India]] to [[West Pakistan]] to teach at [[Islamia Science College (Karachi)|Islamia College, Karachi]]. In the same year, he was invited by the [[Government of Pakistan]] to take charge as [[Principal (university)|Principal]] of [[Comilla Victoria College]] in [[East Pakistan]], a position he held until 1958. During this time (1950<U+2013>58) he also served as President of the East Pakistan Non-Government Teachers' Association.<ref>Yousaf (2003), p. 348.</ref>

== Rural development initiatives ==
During his tenure as principal of Comilla Victoria College, Khan developed a special interest in [[grassroots]] actions. Between 1954 and 1955, he took a break to work as director of the Village Agricultural and Industrial (V-AID) Programme.<ref>V-AID was a government level attempt to promote citizens participation in the sphere of rural development in East and West Pakistan. It was launched in 1953 with technical assistance from the [[Federal government of the United States|US government]].</ref> However, he was not satisfied with the development approach adopted in the programme that was limited to the training of villagers.<ref>Chaudhuri (1969), p. 316.</ref> In 1958, he went to [[Michigan State University]] to acquire education and training in rural development.<ref>Yousaf (2003), p. 349.</ref> Returning in 1959, he established the Pakistan Academy for Rural Development (PARD) at Comilla on [[27 May]] [[1959]] and was appointed as its founding director. He also laid foundations for the Comilla Cooperative Pilot Project in 1959.<ref>Stavis, B. (1985). [http://www.jstor.org/view/0030851x/dm992027/99p0746p/0 Book Review of BARD (1983)]. ''Pacific Affairs'', Vol. 58, No. 4, pp. 727<U+2013>28. Retrieved on [[3 May]] [[2008]].</ref> In 1963, he received a [[Ramon Magsaysay Award]] from the Government of the Philippines for his services in rural development. Khan became Vice Chairman of the Board of Governors of PARD in 1964, and in the same year, was awarded an honorary [[Doctorate of law|Doctorate of Law]] by Michigan State University.<ref>Yousaf (2003), pp. 370<U+2013>74.</ref> In 1969, he delivered a series of lectures at [[Woodrow Wilson School]], [[Princeton University]], based on his experience with rural cooperatives. During the visit, he established collaborative links with [[Arthur Lewis (economist)|Arthur Lewis]].<ref>Yousaf (2003), pp. 350<U+2013>51.</ref>

On his return to East Pakistan, Khan remained attached to the Comilla Project until the [[Bangladesh War of Independence|Partition of Pakistan]], when East Pakistan became Bangladesh. Eventually, Khan moved to West Pakistan. PARD was renamed as [[Bangladesh Academy for Rural Development]] (BARD).<ref>Khan spent a significant part of his life in Comilla. His residence was located in the Ranir Dighir Par area of the town, adjacent to Victoria College where he taught for a long time. As a gesture of respect for his contributions to the community, the Comilla-Kotbari road in Bangladesh was named after him.</ref>

== Advisory roles ==
Following his move to Pakistan, Khan was asked to implement the Comilla Model in rural settlements of [[NWFP]], [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]], and [[Sindh]]. He declined the offer on the grounds that the proposals were predominantly motivated by political interests rather than the common well-being. However, he continued to advise the authorities on various aspects of rural development, such as participatory irrigation management.<ref name="nrsp">NRSP (2000), pp. 4<U+2013>6.</ref> He worked as a research fellow at the [[University of Agriculture, Faisalabad]] from 1971 to 1972, and as Director of Rural Economics Research Project at [[Karachi University]] from 1972 to 1973. Khan went to Michigan State University as a [[visiting professor]] in 1973 and remained there until 1979. During this time, he carried on advising the Rural Development Academy at [[Bogra]] in northern Bangladesh, and the Pakistan Academy for Rural Development, [[Peshawar]], on the Daudzai Integrated Rural Development Programme. He also travelled extensively during this period in the capacities of speaker, advisor, or consultant on rural development programmes across the world.<ref>Yousaf (2003), p. 352.</ref> In 1974, he was appointed as a [[World Bank]] consultant to survey rural development situations in [[Java]], [[Indonesia]]. He also briefly worked as a visiting professor at [[Lund University]], [[Harvard University]], and [[Oxford University]].<ref>Yousaf (2003), pp. 352<U+2013>53.</ref>

In 1980, Khan moved to Karachi and started working on the improvement of sanitary conditions in Karachi suburbs. He laid the foundations of the [[Orangi Pilot Project]] for the largest [[squatter]] community of [[Orangi]] in the city. He remained associated with this project until his death in 1999. Meanwhile, he maintained his support for rural communities around Karachi, and also helped to develop the [[Aga Khan Development Network|Aga Khan Rural Support programme]].<ref name="nrsp" /> OPP became a model for participatory bottom-up development initiatives.<ref>Uphoff, Norman (2001) ''Dr Akhtar Hameed Khan: An Appreciation''. Published in Yousaf (2003), pp. 409<U+2013>13.</ref>

== Major development projects ==
=== Comilla Cooperative Pilot Project ===
{{Main|Comilla Model}}
The [[Comilla Model]] (1959) was Khan's initiative in response to the failure of a Village Agricultural and Industrial Development (V-AID) programme that was launched in 1953 in East and West Pakistan with technical assistance from the US government. V-AID remained a government-level attempt to promote citizen participation in the sphere of [[rural development]].<ref>Bhuiyani, A.H.A. et al (2005). [http://journals.cambridge.org/production/action/cjoGetFulltext?fulltextid=293101 Developmentalism as a Disciplinary Strategy in Bangladesh]. ''Modern Asian Studies'' Vol. 39, No. 2. pp. 349<U+2013>368. Retrieved on [[3 may]] [[2008]].</ref> Khan launched the project in 1959 on his return from Michigan, and developed a methodology of implementation in the areas of agricultural and rural development on the principle of grassroots-level participation.<ref>Raper (1970), p. vi.</ref> Initially, the aim was to provide a development model of programmes and institutions that could be replicated across the country. Advisory support in this respect was provided by experts from Harvard and Michigan State Universities, the [[Ford Foundation]], and [[USAID]].<ref>Yousaf (2003), pp. 370<U+2013>71.</ref> Practical help was also sought from [[Japan]] to improve the local farming techniques.<ref>This helped to raise the annual yield of rice crops from 20 [[maunds]] (about 750 [[kilogram]]s) per acre to 60 maunds (2,240 kilos) per acre (Yousaf 2003, p. 371)</ref>

Comilla Model simultaneously addressed the problems that were caused by the inadequacy of both local infrastructure and institutions through a range of integrated programmes.

After Khan's departure from Comilla, the cooperative's model failed in independent Bangladesh<ref>Karim, M.B. (1985).

The model actually fell prey to the ineffective internal and external controls, stagnation, and diversion of funds.<ref>Chowdhury (1990), p. 54.</ref> This prompted the subsequent scholars and practitioners in microfinance, such as [[Muhammad Yunus]] of [[Grameen Bank]] and [[Fazle Hasan Abed]] of [[BRAC]], to abandon the cooperative approach in favour of more centralised control and service delivery structures. The new strategy targeted the poorest villagers, while excluding the 'less poor'. <ref>Dowla and Barua (2006), p. 18.</ref> However, Khan's leadership skills during the course of his association with the project remained a source of inspiration for these leaders.<ref>Valsan (2005), p. 49.</ref>

=== Orangi Pilot Project ===
{{Main|Orangi Pilot Project}}
The Orangi poverty alleviation project (known as the [[Orangi Pilot Project]], or OPP) was initiated by Khan as an [[NGO]] in 1980.<ref>NGO Profile (1995), [http://eau.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/7/2/227 Orangi Pilot Project], ''Environment and Urbanization'', Vol. 7, No. 2. pp. 227<U+2013>37. Retrieved on [[3 May]] [[2008]].</ref> [[Orangi]] is located on the northwest periphery of Karachi. At that time, it was the largest of the city's approximately 650&nbsp;low-income [[squatter]] settlements (known as ''katchi abadi''). The locality was first developed in [[1963]] as a government township of {{convert|500|ha|acre|0}}. The influx of migrants after the creation of Bangladesh, swelled the settlement to about one million people crowded over an area of more than {{convert|3200|ha|acre|0}}.<ref>WRI (1996).

Comparing the OPP with Comilla project, Akhtar Hameed Khan once commented:

<blockquote>The Orangi Pilot Project was very different from the Comilla Academy. OPP was a private body, dependent for its small fixed budget on another NGO. The vast resources and support of the government, Harvard advisors, MSU, and Ford Foundation was missing. OPP possessed no authority, no sanctions. It may observe and investigate but it could only advise, not enforce.<ref name="intro">''[http://www.pakistan.gov.pk/divisions/lgrd-division/media/ncrd/intro.html Introduction about Late Dr Akhtar Hameed Khan]'' at [[Government of Pakistan]] website. Retrieved on [[15 February]] [[2007]].</ref></blockquote>

The successful OPP model became an inspiration for other [[Municipality|municipalities]] around the country. In 1999, Khan helped to create [[Lodhran]] Pilot Project (LPP) to collaborate with Lodhran municipal committee. Learning from past experiences, the project extended its scope to the whole town instead of concentrating on low-income settlements only. The municipal partnership was itself a new initiative that ensured wider [[Civic engagement|civic]] cooperation.<ref>Hasan (2002), pp. 199<U+2013>216.</ref>

== Death and legacy ==
In 1999, Khan was visiting his family in the United States when he suffered from [[Renal failure|kidney failure]]. He died of [[Myocardial infarction]] on [[9 October]] in [[Indianapolis]] at the age of 85. His body was flown to Karachi on [[15 October]], where he was buried on the grounds of the OPP office compound.<ref>Yousaf (2003), p. 386.</ref>

Khan's ideology and leadership skills were a source of inspiration for his students and colleagues, and continue to serve as guiding principles even after his death.<ref>Sobhan, R. (2006). ''[http://www.irm.edu.pk/Document.pdf Democratizing Development in South Asia: Responding to the Challenge of Globalization]''. [[Dhaka]]: Centre for Policy Dialogue. p. 1.

(1974). ''Development Reconsidered: Bridging the Gap Between Government and People''. Lexington, Massachusetts: Lexington Books.

Soon after Khan's death, on [[10 April]] [[2000]], the Government of Pakistan renamed the National Centre for Rural Development the Akhtar Hameed Khan National Centre for Rural Development and Municipal Administration.<ref name="intro" /> In the same year, the Akhtar Hameed Khan Resource Centre was established in [[Islamabad]], under the auspices of the Institute of Rural Management, as a repository of published and digital resources on rural development.<ref>''[http://www.irm.edu.pk/ahkrc-new/default.asp AHK Resource Centre]''. [http://www.irm.edu.pk/ NRSP - Institute of Rural Management].

Retrieved on [[13 April]] [[2008]].</ref> The annual cash award is given on Khan's birthday to a [[Demography of Pakistan|Pakistani]] author for a book on issues related to rural and urban development, peace, [[poverty alleviation]], or [[gender discrimination]]. At the occasion of the award ceremony in 2006, a documentary film about the life and times of Akhtar Hameed Khan was premiered.<ref>''[http://www.serendip.tv/akhter.htm A Vision Unveiled]'', Premiere of a documentary film on Akhtar Hameed Khan by Serendip Production.
