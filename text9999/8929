'''L<U+00FC> Zuan''' (<U+5442><U+7E82>) (died 401), [[courtesy name]] '''Yongxu''' (<U+6C38><U+7DD2>), formally '''Emperor Ling of (Later) Liang''' ((<U+5F8C>)<U+6DBC><U+9748><U+5E1D>), was an [[emperor]] of the [[History of China|Chinese]]/[[Di (ethnic group)|Di]] state [[Later Liang]].  He was the oldest son of the founding emperor [[L<U+00FC> Guang]] (Emperor Yiwu), but was not L<U+00FC> Guang's rightful heir, as he was not born of L<U+00FC> Guang's wife [[Princess Shi]].  After L<U+00FC> Guang died around new year 400, however, he seized the throne from his younger brother [[L<U+00FC> Shao]] in a coup.

L<U+00FC> Zuan was considered a capable general tactically, but not skilled in general strategy, and during his reign Later Liang's strength continued to be sapped, as it was during the late reign of L<U+00FC> Guang, by attacks of rivals [[Northern Liang]] and [[Southern Liang]].  Despite this, L<U+00FC> Zuan continued to occupy himself with hunting and other unimportant matters.  In 401, he was assassinated by his cousin [[L<U+00FC> Chao]] (<U+5442><U+8D85>), who then supported his own older brother [[L<U+00FC> Long]] as emperor.

==During L<U+00FC> Guang's reign==
L<U+00FC> Zuan was described as favoring exercises in [[archery]], [[horsemanship]], and hunting when he was young, when he was a university student at the [[Former Qin]] capital [[Chang'an]] during the reign of [[Fu Ji<U+0101>n]], where he was not studious.  When Former Qin collapsed in the midst of multiple rebellions in 384 and 385, L<U+00FC> Zuan fled initially to Shanggui (<U+4E0A><U+90BD>, in modern [[Tianshui]], [[Gansu]]), and then to Guzang (<U+59D1><U+81E7>, in modern [[Wuwei]], [[Gansu]]), where his father had established Later Liang and placed his capital.

The first actual historical reference to L<U+00FC> Zuan was in 392, when he served as one of his father L<U+00FC> Guang's generals in his campaign against [[Qifu Gangui]], the prince of [[Western Qin]], and L<U+00FC> Zuan was unsuccessful in his attack on Qifu Gangui.  In 397, L<U+00FC> Guang, who had by then claimed imperial title, sent his son L<U+00FC> Zuan (then referred to as the Duke of Taiyuan) and his brother L<U+00FC> Yan (<U+5442><U+5EF6>) against Qifu Gangui, who had previously agreed to be a vassal and then changed his mind.  Initially, L<U+00FC> Zuan was successful, capturing the important city Jincheng (<U+91D1><U+57CE>, in modern [[Lanzhou]], [[Gansu]]), but after his uncle was defeated and killed in a trap laid by Qifu Gangui, L<U+00FC> Zuan was forced to withdraw.

Throughout the rest of L<U+00FC> Guang's reign, L<U+00FC> Zuan became the general that his father relied on the most.  In 397, when the [[Xiongnu]] general [[Juqu Mengxun]] rebelled, L<U+00FC> Guang sent L<U+00FC> Zuan against him, and L<U+00FC> Zuan was initially successful in defeating Juqu Mengxun and forcing him to flee.  However, after Juqu Mengxun's cousin Juqu Nancheng (<U+6CAE><U+6E20><U+7537><U+6210>) persuaded the official [[Duan Ye]] to join them and establish [[Northern Liang]], L<U+00FC> Guang was faced with a serious rebellion at Guzang itself<U+2014>a rebellion by the general Yang Gui (<U+694A><U+8ECC>) and the magician Guo Nen (<U+90ED><U+9EC1>), and L<U+00FC> Zuan, while he had Duan Ye's capital Jiankang (<U+5EFA><U+5EB7>, in modern [[Zhangye]], [[Gansu]]) under siege, was forced to withdraw to fight Yang and Guo, allowing Duan Ye's nascent state to survive.  In 398, L<U+00FC> Zuan and his brother L<U+00FC> Hong (<U+5442><U+5F18>) joined forces and defeated Yang and Guo, forcing them to surrender to [[Southern Liang]] and Western Qin, respectively.

In 399, L<U+00FC> Zuan and his brother [[L<U+00FC> Shao]], L<U+00FC> Guang's [[heir apparent]], attacked Northern Liang, and were initially successfully, but after Southern Liang's prince [[Tufa Wugu]] sent Yang Gui and his brother [[Tufa Lilugu]] to aid Northern Liang, L<U+00FC> Zuan and L<U+00FC> Shao were forced to withdraw.

==Coup against L<U+00FC> Shao==
Around the new year 400, L<U+00FC> Guang grew seriously ill.  He ordered L<U+00FC> Shao to take the throne as "Heavenly Prince" (''[[Tian Wang]]''), while he himself claimed the title of [[retired emperor]].  L<U+00FC> Zuan was put in charge of the military forces, and L<U+00FC> Hong the government.  L<U+00FC> Guang told the three to be united, and that L<U+00FC> Shao should trust his brothers.  He also told L<U+00FC> Zuan and L<U+00FC> Hong that L<U+00FC> Shao might not be talented, but was the rightful heir, and that they should assist him faithfully.  L<U+00FC> Guang died later that day.

Initially, L<U+00FC> Shao was not going to immediately announce L<U+00FC> Guang's death, in fear that it might draw enemy attacks, but L<U+00FC> Zuan broke down the door and forcibly entered the palace and mourned.  L<U+00FC> Shao became fearful and offered the throne to L<U+00FC> Zuan, but L<U+00FC> Zuan refused.  L<U+00FC> Shao's cousin [[L<U+00FC> Chao]] (<U+5442><U+8D85>) then secretly suggested to L<U+00FC> Shao that L<U+00FC> Zuan be arrested and executed, but L<U+00FC> Shao refused.

However, soon thereafter (either that day or at most several days after), L<U+00FC> Shao sent his assistant Jiang Ji (<U+59DC><U+7D00>) to encourage L<U+00FC> Zuan to seize the throne.  At night, then, L<U+00FC> Zuan led his personal guards to attack the palace.  L<U+00FC> Hong joined him.  L<U+00FC> Shao's guards initially resisted, and one of them, Qi Cong (<U+9F4A><U+5F9E>), hit L<U+00FC> Zuan in the head with a sword but could not kill him.  L<U+00FC> Chao also tried to assist L<U+00FC> Shao, but their forces were fearful of L<U+00FC> Zuan and collapsed.  L<U+00FC> Shao fled to a secondary palace and committed suicide.  L<U+00FC> Zuan took the throne.

==Reign==
L<U+00FC> Zuan initially entrusted L<U+00FC> Hong with all governmental matters, and also tried to show generosity by pardoning Qi Chong and L<U+00FC> Chao.  However, L<U+00FC> Zuan and L<U+00FC> Hong soon became suspicious of each other, and in spring 400, L<U+00FC> Hong rebelled with his troops.  L<U+00FC> Zuan defeated L<U+00FC> Hong's rebellion, and permitted his troops to pillage even the capital city Guzang itself, rewarding the women of the secondary district Dongwan (<U+6771><U+82D1>, eastern half of Guzang) to his soldiers<U+2014>including L<U+00FC> Hong's wife and daughters.  While he later relented and cancelled those orders under suggestion of Fang Gui (<U+623F><U+6677>), the damage had been done.  When L<U+00FC> Hong was subsequently captured during his flight to Southern Liang, L<U+00FC> Zuan had him executed cruelly<U+2014>by having his ribs repeatedly bounded.

Also in 400, L<U+00FC> Zuan created his wife [[Empress Yang (Ling)|Lady Yang]] empress.

L<U+00FC> Zuan soon started a campaign against Southern Liang, whose prince was by now Tufa Lilugu, but he was quickly defeated by Tufa Lilugu's brother [[Tufa Rutan]].  In summer, he started another campaign against Northern Liang, which was initially successful, as he put Northern Liang's new capital Zhangye (<U+5F35><U+6396>, in modern [[Zhangye]], [[Gansu]]) under siege, but as the official Jiang Ji (<U+59DC><U+7D00>), who tried to persuade him not to carry out the campaign, predicted, Tufa Rutan made a major attack and even entered the city of Guzang before retreating, forcing L<U+00FC> Zuan to end his campaign against Northern Liang.

Despite these military defeats, L<U+00FC> Zuan spent much of his time drinking and hunting.  When his official Yang Ying (<U+694A><U+7A4E>) tried to persuade him to change his ways, he thanked and apologized to Yang, but could not change his ways.

In 401, L<U+00FC> Chao, without prior approval from L<U+00FC> Zuan, attacked the [[Xianbei]] chief Sipan (<U+601D><U+76E4>).  Sipan sent his brother Qizhen (<U+4E5E><U+73CD>) to file a protest with L<U+00FC> Zuan, and L<U+00FC> Zuan summoned L<U+00FC> Chao and Sipan both to Guzang, which got L<U+00FC> Chao nervous.  Once L<U+00FC> Zuan met with both, he threatened L<U+00FC> Chao with death<U+2014>but had  no intent to carry the threat out; rather, he intended only to scare L<U+00FC> Chao.  He then held a feast for L<U+00FC> Chao and Sipan, intending to create peace between them.  During the feast, L<U+00FC> Chao's brother [[L<U+00FC> Long]] repeatedly offered L<U+00FC> Zuan wine, and L<U+00FC> Zuan was soon drunk.  He sat on a man-pulled cart and gave L<U+00FC> Chao and Sipan a tour of the palace.  When the cart came to a threshold between two palaces, the cart could not roll over the threshold, and L<U+00FC> Zuan's guards Dou Chuan (<U+7AC7><U+5DDD>) and Luo Teng (<U+99F1><U+9A30>) left their swords on the side in order to lift the cart across.  As they did, L<U+00FC> Chao took their swords and attacked L<U+00FC> Zuan.  L<U+00FC> Zuan tried to combat L<U+00FC> Chao, unarmed, but L<U+00FC> Chao quickly pierced him with a sword.  Both Dou and Luo tried to combat L<U+00FC> Chao but were also killed by him.  L<U+00FC> Zuan's wife Empress Yang tried to mobilize the guards to combat L<U+00FC> Chao, but the guards soon abandoned her, and L<U+00FC> Chao made his brother L<U+00FC> Long emperor to succeed L<U+00FC> Zuan.  L<U+00FC> Zuan's head was cut off and shown to the populace, but L<U+00FC> Zuan was still later given an imperial [[posthumous name]], albeit an unflattering one.
