'''Catherine de' Medici''' (13 April 1519 <U+2013> 5 January 1589) was born in [[Florence]], [[Italy]], as '''Caterina Maria Romula di Lorenzo de' Medici'''. 

Both her parents, [[Lorenzo II de' Medici, Duke of Urbino]], and [[Madeleine de La Tour d'Auvergne|Madeleine de La Tour d'Auvergne, Countess of Boulogne]], died within weeks of her birth. 

In 1533, at the age of fourteen, Caterina married Henry, second son of [[Francis I of France|King Francis I]] and [[Claude of France|Queen Claude of France]]. Under the [[Francization|gallicised]] version of her name, '''Catherine de M<U+00E9>dicis''',<ref>Pronounced "medi-cease".</ref> she was [[List of French consorts|Queen consort of France]] as the wife of King [[Henry II of France]] from 1547 to 1559. Throughout his reign, Henry excluded Catherine from participating in state affairs and instead showered favours on his chief mistress, [[Diane de Poitiers]], who wielded much influence over him. Henry's death thrust Catherine into the political arena as mother of the frail fifteen-year-old King [[Francis II of France|Francis II]]. When he died in 1560, she became [[regent]] on behalf of her ten-year-old son [[Charles IX of France|King Charles IX]] and was granted sweeping powers. After Charles died in 1574, Catherine played a key role in the reign of her third son, [[Henry III of France|Henry III]]. He dispensed with her advice only in the last months of her life.

Catherine's three sons reigned in an age of almost constant civil and religious war in France. The problems facing the monarchy were complex and daunting. At first, Catherine compromised and made concessions to the rebelling Protestants, or [[Huguenot]]s, as they became known. She failed, however, to grasp the theological issues that drove their movement. Later, she resorted in frustration and anger to hard-line policies against them.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 272.</ref> In return, she came to be blamed for the excessive persecutions carried out under her sons' rule, in particular for the [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre]] of 1572, in which thousands of Huguenots were killed in Paris and throughout France.

Some recent historians have excused Catherine from blame for the worst decisions of the crown, though evidence for her ruthlessness can be found in her letters.<ref>Knecht, 272. For a summary of the fluctuations in Catherine's historical reputation, see the preface to R. J. Knecht's ''Catherine de' Medici'', 1998: xi<U+2013>xiv.</ref> In practice, her authority was always limited by the effects of the civil wars. Her policies, therefore, may be seen as desperate measures to keep the [[House of Valois|Valois monarchy]] on the throne at all costs, and her spectacular patronage of the arts as an attempt to glorify a monarchy whose prestige was in steep decline.<ref>Sutherland, ''Ancien R<U+00E9>gime'', 20.; Frieda, 454<U+2013>55.</ref> Without Catherine, it is unlikely that her sons would have remained in power.<ref>Sutherland, ''Ancien R<U+00E9>gime'', 26.</ref> The years in which they reigned have been called "the age of Catherine de' Medici".<ref>Thomson, 97; Sutherland, ''Ancien R<U+00E9>gime'', 3; Neale, ''The Age of Catherine de Medici''.</ref>

==Birth and upbringing==
[[Image:Clement VII. Sebastiano del Piombo. c.1531..jpg|thumb|upright|left|Giulio di Giuliano de' Medici, [[Pope Clement VII]], by [[Sebastiano del Piombo]], c.1531. Clement called Catherine's betrothal to [[Henry II of France|Henry of Orl<U+00E9>ans]] "the greatest match in the world".<ref name = "Fxxxv">Frieda, 35.</ref>]]

The Medici were a nouveau riche family: originally bankers, they came to great wealth and power by bankrolling the monarchies of Europe. Catherine's father, Lorenzo II de' Medici, was made [[Duke of Urbino]] by her uncle [[Pope Leo X]], and the title reverted to [[Francesco Maria I della Rovere]] after Lorenzo's death. Thus, even though her father was a duke, Catherine was of relatively low birth. However her mother, [[Madeleine de la Tour d'Auvergne]], the Countess of Boulogne, was from one of the most [[House of La Tour d'Auvergne|prominent and ancient French noble family]] and this prestigious maternal heritage is no stranger to her being married to a [[Fils de France|Royal Prince of France]].

According to a contemporary chronicler, when Catherine de' Medici was born in Florence on Wednesday 13 April 1519, her parents, were "as pleased as if it had been a boy".<ref>Goro Gheri, 15 April 1519, quoted by Frieda, 14.</ref> Their pleasure, however, was short-lived. Madeleine died on 28 April and Lorenzo died on 4 May. The young couple were married the year before at [[Amboise]] as part of the alliance between King [[Francis I of France]] and Pope Leo against the [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I]]. King Francis wanted Catherine to be raised at the French court, but Pope Leo had other plans for her. He intended to marry her to his brother's illegitimate son, [[Ippolito de' Medici]], and set them up to rule Florence.

Catherine was first cared for by her paternal grandmother, Alfonsina Orsini (wife of [[Piero di Lorenzo de' Medici|Piero de' Medici]]). After Alfonsina's death in 1520, Catherine joined her cousins and was raised by her aunt, [[Clarice de' Medici|Clarice Strozzi]]. The death of Pope Leo in 1521 interrupted Medici power briefly, until Cardinal Giulio de' Medici was elected [[Pope Clement VII]] in 1523. Clement housed Catherine in the [[Palazzo Medici Riccardi|Palazzo Medici]] in Florence, where she lived in state. The Florentine people called her "''duchessina''", the little duchess, in deference to her unrecognised claim to the [[Duchy of Urbino]].<ref>Frieda, 23<U+2013>24.</ref><ref>Young, ''The Medici: Volume II'', 15.</ref>

In 1527, the Medici were overthrown in Florence by a faction opposed to the regime of Clement's representative, [[Silvio Passerini|Cardinal Passerini]], and Catherine was taken hostage and placed in a series of convents.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 11.</ref> Clement had no choice but to crown [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles]] Holy Roman Emperor in return for his help in retaking the city.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 10<U+2013>11.</ref> In October 1529, Charles's troops laid [[Siege of Florence (1529<U+2013>1530)|siege to Florence]]. As the siege dragged on, voices called for Catherine to be killed and exposed on the city walls. Soldiers made her ride through the streets on a donkey, jeered by an angry crowd.<ref>Frieda, 29<U+2013>30.</ref> The city finally surrendered on 12 August 1530. Clement called Catherine to Rome and greeted her with open arms and tears in his eyes. Then he set about the business of finding her a husband.<ref name= "kxii">Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 12.</ref>

==Marriage==
[[File:Henry II, king of France.. F Clouet.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Henry II of France|Henry, Duke of Orl<U+00E9>ans]], by [[Corneille de Lyon]]. During his childhood, Henry spent almost four and a half years as a hostage in Spain, an ordeal that marked him for life, leaving him introverted and gloomy.<ref>Frieda, 45.</ref>]]

On her visit to Rome, the Venetian envoy described her as "small of stature, and thin, and without delicate features, but having the protruding eyes peculiar to the Medici family".<ref>Frieda, 31; Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 14.</ref> Suitors, however, lined up for her hand; and when in early 1533 Francis I of France proposed his second son, [[Henry II of France|Henry, Duke of Orl<U+00E9>ans]], Clement jumped at the offer. Henry was a prize catch for Catherine, who despite her wealth was from commoner origins.<ref name = "Fxxxv">Frieda, 35.</ref>

The wedding, a grand affair marked by extravagant display and gift-giving,<ref name=friedaandknecht/> took place in [[Marseille]] on 28 October 1533.<ref>Frieda, 52.  The contract was signed on the 27th and the religious ceremony took place the next day.</ref> Prince Henry danced and [[jousting|jousted]] for Catherine. The fourteen-year-old couple left their wedding ball at midnight to perform their nuptial duties. Henry arrived in the bedroom with King Francis, who is said to have stayed until the marriage was consummated. He noted that "each had shown valour in the joust".<ref name=friedaandknecht>Frieda, 53; Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 16.</ref> Clement visited the newlyweds in bed the next morning and added his blessings to the night's proceedings.<ref>Frieda, 53.</ref>

Catherine saw little of her husband in their first year of marriage, but the ladies of the court treated her well, impressed with her intelligence and keenness to please.<ref>Frieda, 54.</ref> The death of Pope Clement VII on 25 September 1534, however, undermined Catherine's standing in the French court. The next pope, [[Pope Paul III|Paul III]], broke the alliance with France and refused to pay her huge dowry. King Francis lamented, "The girl has come to me stark naked."<ref>"''J'ai re<U+00E7>u la fille toute nue.''" Frieda, 54.</ref>

Prince Henry showed no interest in Catherine as a wife; instead, he openly took mistresses. For the first ten years of the marriage, Catherine failed to produce any children. In 1537, on the other hand, Philippa Duci, one of Henry's mistresses, gave birth to a daughter, whom he publicly acknowledged.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 29<U+2013>30. Henry legitimised the child under the name [[Diane de France]]; he also produced at least two sons by other women.</ref> This proved that Henry was fertile and added to the pressure on Catherine to produce a child.

===Dauphine===
In 1536, Henry's older brother, [[Francis, Dauphin of France (1518-1536)|Francis]], caught a chill after a game of tennis, contracted a fever, and died, leaving Henry the heir. As Dauphine, Catherine was now expected to provide a future heir to the throne.<ref name = "kxxiv">Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 29.</ref> According to the court chronicler [[Pierre de Bourdeille, seigneur de Brant<U+00F4>me|Brant<U+00F4>me]], "many people advised the king and the Dauphin to repudiate her, since it was necessary to continue the line of France".<ref>Knecht, 29.</ref> Divorce was discussed. In desperation, Catherine tried every known trick for getting pregnant, such as placing cow dung and ground stags' antlers on her "source of life", and drinking mule's urine.<ref>Frieda, 67.</ref> On 20 January 1544, she at last gave birth to a son, named after King Francis. The old king greeted the news with tears of joy.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

After becoming pregnant once, Catherine had no trouble doing so again. She may have owed her change of luck to the physician [[Jean Fernel]], who had noticed slight abnormalities in the couple's sexual organs and advised them how to solve the problem.<ref>Frieda, 68.</ref> Catherine went on to bear Henry a further nine children, seven of whom survived infancy, including the future [[Charles IX of France|Charles IX]] (born 27 June 1550); the future [[Henry III of France|Henry III]] (born 19 September 1551); and [[Francis, Duke of Anjou|Francis]] (born 18 March 1555). The long-term future of the [[House of Valois|Valois dynasty]], which had ruled France since the 14th century, seemed assured.

Catherine's new-found ability to bear children, however, failed to improve her marriage. In 1538, at the age of nineteen, Henry had taken as his mistress the thirty-eight year old [[Diane de Poitiers]], whom he adored for the rest of his life.<ref>Frieda, 60, 95; Heritier, 38<U+2013>42.</ref> Even so, he respected Catherine's status as his consort.<ref>Frieda, 114, 132.</ref> When King Francis I died in 1547 Catherine became queen consort of France. She was crowned in the [[Basilique Saint-Denis|basilica of Saint-Denis]] in June 1549.

===Queen of France===
[[Image:KatharinavonMedici.jpg|thumb|left|Catherine de' Medici, as Queen of France. "Her mouth is too large and her eyes too prominent and colourless for beauty", wrote a Venetian envoy as Catherine approached forty, "but a very distinguished-looking woman, with a shapely figure, a beautiful skin and exquisitely shaped hands".<ref>Giovanni Capello, quoted by Frieda, 132.</ref>]]
Henry allowed Catherine almost no political influence as queen.<ref>Morris, 247; Frieda, 80.</ref> Although she sometimes acted as regent during his absences from France, her powers were strictly nominal.<ref>Frieda, 118; Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 42<U+2013>43.</ref> Henry gave the [[Ch<U+00E2>teau de Chenonceau|Ch<U+00E2>teau of Chenonceau]], which Catherine had wanted for herself, to [[Diane de Poitiers]], who took her place at the centre of power, dispensing patronage and accepting favours.<ref>Frieda, 80<U+2013>86.</ref>

The imperial ambassador reported that in the presence of guests, Henry would sit on Diane's lap and play the guitar, chat about politics, or fondle her breasts.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 38; Frieda, 94<U+2013>95.</ref> Diane never regarded Catherine as a threat. She even encouraged the king to sleep with her and father more children. In 1556, Catherine nearly died giving birth to twin daughters. Surgeons saved her life by breaking the legs of one of the two babies, who died in her womb.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 34; Frieda, 123.</ref> The surviving daughter died seven weeks later. Catherine had no more children.

Henry's reign also saw the rise of the Guise brothers, [[Charles, Cardinal of Lorraine|Charles]], who became a [[cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]], and Henry's boyhood friend [[Francis, Duke of Guise|Francis]], who became [[Counts and Dukes of Guise|Duke of Guise]].<ref>Frieda, 84.</ref> Their sister [[Mary of Guise]] had married [[James V of Scotland]] in 1538 and was the mother of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]]. At the age of five and a half, Mary was brought to the French court, where she was promised to the Dauphin, Francis.<ref>Guy, 46.</ref> Catherine brought her up with her own children at the French court, while Mary of Guise governed Scotland as her daughter's [[regent]].<ref>Guy, 41.</ref>

[[File:Brazilian ball for Henry II in Rouen October 1 1550.jpg|thumb|"[[France Antarctique|Brazilian ball]]" for [[Henry II of France|Henry II]] and Catherine de' Medici in [[Rouen]], 1 October 1550, a precursor to the creation of [[France Antarctique]] in [[Brazil]].]]
On 3<U+2013>4 April 1559, Henry signed the [[Italian War of 1551<U+2013>1559|Peace of Cateau-Cambr<U+00E9>sis]] with the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and England, ending a long period of [[Italian Wars|Italian wars]]. The treaty was sealed by the betrothal of Catherine's thirteen-year-old daughter [[Elisabeth of Valois|Elisabeth]] to [[Philip II of Spain]].<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 55.</ref> Their [[proxy wedding]] in Paris on 22 June 1559 was celebrated with festivities, balls, [[masque]]s, and five days of [[jousting]].

King Henry took part in the jousting, sporting Diane's black-and-white colours. He defeated the dukes of Guise and Nemours, but the young [[Gabriel, comte de Montgomery]], knocked him half out of the saddle. Henry insisted on riding against Montgomery again, and this time, Montgomery's lance shattered into the king's face.<ref name="Pettegree, 154">Pettegree, 154.</ref> Henry reeled out of the clash, his face pouring blood, with splinters "of a good bigness" sticking out of his eye and head.<ref>Frieda, 5. As reported by eyewitness [[Nicholas Throckmorton]], the English ambassador.</ref> Catherine, Diane, and Prince Francis all fainted. Henry was carried to the Ch<U+00E2>teau de Tournelles, where five splinters of wood were extracted from his head, one of which had pierced his eye and brain. Catherine stayed by his bedside, but Diane kept away, "for fear", in the words of a chronicler, "of being expelled by the Queen".<ref>Frieda, 6.</ref> For the next ten days, Henry's state fluctuated. At times he even felt well enough to dictate letters and listen to music. Slowly, however, he lost his sight, speech, and reason, and on 10 July 1559 he died. From that day, Catherine took a broken lance as her emblem, inscribed with the words "''lacrymae hinc, hinc dolor''" ("from this come my tears and my pain"), and wore black [[mourning]] in memory of Henry.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 56<U+2013>58; Frieda, 146.</ref>

==Queen mother==
===Reign of Francis II===
[[Image:FrancoisII.jpg| thumb| upright| [[Francis II of France]], by [[Fran<U+00E7>ois Clouet]], 1560. Francis found the crown so heavy at his coronation that four nobles had to hold it in place as he walked up the steps to his throne.<ref>Guy, 102<U+2013>3.</ref>]]

[[Francis II of France|Francis II]] became king at the age of fifteen. In what has been called a ''[[coup d'<U+00E9>tat]]'', the Cardinal of Lorraine and the [[Francis, Duke of Guise|Duke of Guise]]<U+2014>whose niece, Mary, Queen of Scots, had married Francis the year before<U+2014>seized power the day after Henry II's death and quickly moved themselves into the [[Louvre]] with the young couple.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 59; Frieda, 140.</ref> The English ambassador reported a few days later that "the house of Guise ruleth and doth all about the French king".<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 60.</ref> For the moment, Catherine worked with the Guises out of necessity. She was not strictly entitled to a role in Francis's government, because he was deemed old enough to rule for himself.<ref>Morris, 248.</ref> Nevertheless, all his official acts began with the words: "This being the good pleasure of the Queen, my lady-mother, and I also approving of every opinion that she holdeth, am content and command that&nbsp;...."<ref>Frieda, 146.</ref> Catherine did not hesitate to exploit her new authority. One of her first acts was to force Diane de Poitiers to hand over the crown jewels and return the [[Ch<U+00E2>teau de Chenonceau]] to the crown.<ref name="Frieda, 144">Frieda, 144.</ref> She later did her best to efface or outdo Diane's building work there.<ref name="Frieda, 144"/>

The Guise brothers set about persecuting the Protestants with zeal. Catherine adopted a moderate stance and spoke up against the Guise persecutions, though she had no particular sympathy for the Huguenots, whose beliefs she never shared. The Protestants looked for leadership first to [[Antoine of Navarre|Antoine de Bourbon, King of Navarre]], the [[First Prince of the Blood]], and then, with more success, to his brother, [[Louis, Prince of Cond<U+00E9> (1530<U+2013>1569)|Louis de Bourbon, Prince of Cond<U+00E9>]], who backed a plot to overthrow the Guises by force.<ref>Frieda, 154; Holt, 38<U+2013>39.</ref> When the Guises heard of the plot,<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 64; Holt, 44. The incident was known later as the [[Amboise conspiracy|"tumult" or conspiracy of Amboise]].</ref> they moved the court to the fortified [[Ch<U+00E2>teau d'Amboise|Ch<U+00E2>teau of Amboise]]. The Duke of Guise launched an attack into the woods around the ch<U+00E2>teau. His troops surprised the rebels and killed many of them on the spot, including the commander, La Renaudie.<ref>Knecht, ''Renaissance France'', 282.</ref>  Others they drowned in the river or strung up around the battlements while Catherine and the court watched.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 65<U+2013>66.</ref>

In June 1560, [[Michel de l'H<U+00F4>pital]] was appointed [[List of Justice Ministers of France|Chancellor of France]]. He sought the support of France's constitutional bodies and worked closely with Catherine to defend the law in the face of the growing anarchy.<ref>Sutherland, ''Ancien R<U+00E9>gime'', 32.</ref> Neither saw the need to punish Protestants who worshipped in private and did not take up arms. On 20 August 1560, Catherine and the chancellor advocated this policy to an assembly of notables at [[Ch<U+00E2>teau de Fontainebleau|Fontainebleau]]. Historians regard the occasion as an early example of Catherine's statesmanship. Meanwhile, Cond<U+00E9> raised an army and in autumn 1560 began attacking towns in the south. Catherine ordered him to court and had him imprisoned as soon as he arrived. He was tried in November, found guilty of offences against the crown, and sentenced to execution. His life was saved by the illness and death of the king, as a result of an infection or an [[abscess]] in his ear.<ref>Frieda, 151; Knecht, 72; Guy, 119.</ref>

When Catherine had realized Francis was going to die, she made a pact with Antoine de Bourbon by which he would renounce his right to the regency of the future king, [[Charles IX of France|Charles IX]], in return for the release of his brother Cond<U+00E9>.<ref>Pettegree, 154; Hoogvliet, 105. The regency was traditionally the preserve of the princes of the blood.</ref> As a result, when Francis died on 5 December 1560, the Privy Council appointed Catherine as governor of France (''gouvernante de France''), with sweeping powers. She wrote to her daughter Elisabeth: "My principal aim is to have the honour of God before my eyes in all things and to preserve my authority, not for myself, but for the conservation of this kingdom and for the good of all your brothers".<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 73.</ref>

===Reign of Charles IX===
[[Image:Charles IX of France by F. Clouet.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Charles IX of France]], after [[Fran<U+00E7>ois Clouet]], c. 1565. The Venetian ambassador Giovanni Michiel described Charles as "an admirable child, with fine eyes, gracious movements, though he is not robust. He favours physical exercise that is too violent for his health, for he suffers from shortness of breath".<ref>Quoted by Frieda, 203.</ref>]]

At first Catherine kept the nine-year-old king, who cried at his coronation, close to her, and slept in his chamber {{citation needed|date=October 2010}}. She presided over his council, decided policy, and controlled state business and patronage. However, she was never in a position to control the country as a whole, which was on the brink of civil war. In many parts of France the rule of nobles held sway rather than that of the crown. The challenges Catherine faced were complex and in some ways difficult for her to comprehend as a foreigner.<ref>Sutherland, ''Ancien R<U+00E9>gime'', 28.</ref>

She summoned church leaders from both sides to attempt to solve their doctrinal differences. Despite her optimism, the resulting [[Colloquy of Poissy]] ended in failure on 13 October 1561, dissolving itself without her permission.<ref>Manetsch, 22.</ref> Catherine failed because she saw the religious divide only in political terms. In the words of historian R. J. Knecht, "she underestimated the strength of religious conviction, imagining that all would be well if only she could get the party leaders to agree".<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 80.</ref> In January 1562, Catherine issued the tolerant [[Edict of Saint-Germain]] in a further attempt to build bridges with the Protestants.<ref>Knecht, ''Renaissance France'', 311; Sutherland, ''Ancien R<U+00E9>gime'', 11<U+2013>12. The edict, also known as the Edict of Toleration and the Edict of January, was significant for effectively recognising the existence of Protestant churches and permitting their worship outside city walls.</ref> On 1 March 1562, however, in an incident known as the [[Massacre of Vassy]], the Duke of Guise and his men attacked worshipping Huguenots in a barn at [[Wassy|Vassy (Wassy)]], killing 74 and wounding 104.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 87; Frieda, 188.</ref> Guise, who called the massacre "a regrettable accident", was cheered as a hero in the streets of Paris while the Huguenots called for revenge.<ref>Frieda,  188<U+2013>89.</ref> The massacre lit the fuse that sparked the [[French Wars of Religion]]. For the next thirty years, France found itself in a state of either civil war or armed truce.<ref>Sutherland, ''Secretaries of State'', 140.</ref>

Within a month [[Louis, Prince of Cond<U+00E9> (1530<U+2013>1569)|Louis de Bourbon, Prince of Cond<U+00E9>]] and [[Gaspard de Coligny|Admiral Gaspard de Coligny]] had raised an army of 1,800. They formed an alliance with England and seized town after town in France.<ref>Frieda, 191. The rebels signed the [[Treaty of Hampton Court (1562)|Treaty of Hampton Court]] with [[Elizabeth I of England]], giving her [[Le Havre]] (to be exchanged later for [[Calais]]), in return for her support.</ref> Catherine met Coligny, but he refused to back down. She therefore told him: "Since you rely on your forces, we will show you ours".<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 89.</ref>  The royal army struck back quickly and laid siege to Huguenot-held [[Rouen]]. Catherine visited the deathbed of [[Antoine of Navarre|Antoine de Bourbon, King of Navarre]], after he was fatally wounded by an [[arquebus]] shot.<ref>Frieda, 192<U+2013>93. His wife, [[Jeanne d'Albret]], remained [[queen regnant]] of Navarre; and her eight-year-old son [[Henry IV of France|Henry]] became First Prince of the Blood.</ref> Catherine insisted on visiting the field herself and when warned of the dangers laughed, "My courage is as great as yours".<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 90.</ref> The Catholics took Rouen, but their triumph was short lived. On 18 February 1563, a spy called [[Jean de Poltrot|Poltrot de M<U+00E9>r<U+00E9>]] fired an arquebus into the back of the [[Claude, Duke of Guise|Duke of Guise]], at the siege of Orl<U+00E9>ans. The murder triggered an aristocratic [[feud|blood feud]] that complicated the French civil wars for years to come.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 91; Carroll, 126; Sutherland, ''Ancien R<U+00E9>gime'', 17.</ref> Catherine, however, was delighted with the death of her ally. "If Monsieur de Guise had perished sooner", she told the Venetian ambassador, "peace would have been achieved more quickly".<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 91<U+2013>92.</ref> On 19 March 1563, the [[Edict of Amboise]], also known as the Edict of Pacification, ended the war. Catherine now rallied both Huguenot and Catholic forces to retake [[Le Havre]] from the English.

====Huguenots====
On 17 August 1563, Charles IX was declared of age at the [[Parlement]] of Rouen, but he was never able to rule on his own and showed little interest in government.<ref>Frieda, 268; Sutherland, ''Ancien R<U+00E9>gime'', 20.</ref> Catherine decided to launch a drive to enforce the [[Edict of Amboise]] and revive loyalty to the crown. To this end, she set out with Charles and the court on a [[royal entry|progress]] around France that lasted from January 1564 until May 1565.<ref>Sutherland, ''Ancien R<U+00E9>gime'', 15.</ref> Catherine held talks with the Protestant Queen [[Jeanne III of Navarre]] at [[M<U+00E2>con]] and [[N<U+00E9>rac]]. She also met her daughter [[Elisabeth of Valois|Elisabeth]] at [[Bayonne]] near the Spanish border, amidst lavish [[Catherine de' Medici's court festivals|court festivities]]. [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] excused himself from the occasion. He sent the [[Fernando <U+00C1>lvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba|Duke of Alba]] to tell Catherine to scrap the Edict of Amboise and to find punitive solutions to the problem of heresy.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 104, 107<U+2013>8; Frieda, 224.</ref>

In 1566, through the ambassador to the [[Ottoman Empire]] [[Guillaume de Grandchamp de Grantrie]] and because of a long-standing [[Franco-Ottoman alliance]], [[Charles IX of France]] and Catherine de Medicis proposed to the Ottoman Court a plan to resettle French [[Huguenots]] and French and German [[Lutherans]] in Ottoman-controlled [[Moldavia]], in order to create a military colony and a buffer against the [[Hapsburg]]. This plan also had the added advantage of removing the Huguenots from [[France]], but it failed to interest the Ottomans.<ref name="Faroqhi">[http://books.google.com/books?id=-m8mind_TVIC&pg=PA37 ''The Ottoman Empire and the world around it'' by Suraiya Faroqhi p.37]</ref>

On 27 September 1567, in a swoop known as the [[Surprise of Meaux]], Huguenot forces attempted to ambush the king, triggering renewed civil war.<ref>Wood, 17.</ref> Taken unawares, the court fled to Paris in disarray.<ref>Frieda, 234; Sutherland, ''Secretaries of State'', 147.</ref> The war was ended by the [[Peace of Longjumeau]] of 22<U+2013>23 March 1568, but civil unrest and bloodshed continued.<ref>Frieda, 239; Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 118.</ref> The [[Surprise of Meaux]] marked a turning point in Catherine's policy towards the Huguenots. From that moment, she abandoned compromise for a policy of repression.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 120.</ref> She told the Venetian ambassador in June 1568 that all one could expect from Huguenots was deceit, and she praised the Duke of Alba's reign of terror in the Netherlands, where [[Calvinist]]s and rebels were put to death in the thousands.<ref>Frieda, 232.</ref>

[[Image:Jeanne-albret-navarre.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jeanne III of Navarre|Jeanne d'Albret, Queen of Navarre]], by [[Fran<U+00E7>ois Clouet]], 1570. She wrote to her son, Henry, in 1572: "All she [Catherine] does is mock me, and afterwards tells others exactly the opposite of what I have said&nbsp;... she denies everything, laughing in my face&nbsp;... she treats me so shamefully that the patience I manage to maintain surpasses that of [[Griselda (folklore)|Griselda]]".<ref>Quoted by Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 149.</ref>]]

The Huguenots retreated to the fortified stronghold of [[La Rochelle]] on the west coast, where Jeanne d'Albret and her fifteen-year-old son, [[Henry IV of France|Henry of Bourbon]], joined them.<ref>Bryson, 204.</ref> "We have come to the determination to die, all of us", Jeanne wrote to Catherine, "rather than abandon our God, and our religion".<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 132.</ref> Catherine called Jeanne, whose decision to rebel posed a dynastic threat to the Valois, "the most shameless woman in the world".<ref>Frieda, 241.</ref> Nevertheless, the [[Peace of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], signed on 8 August 1570 because the royal army ran out of cash, conceded wider toleration to the Huguenots than ever before.<ref>Wood, 28.</ref>

Catherine looked to further Valois interests by grand dynastic marriages. In 1570, Charles IX married [[Elisabeth of Austria (1554-1592)|Elisabeth of Austria]], daughter of [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor]]. Catherine was also eager for a match between one of her two youngest sons and [[Elizabeth I of England]].<ref>Holt, 77; Frieda, 397. In 1579, Fran<U+00E7>ois, Duke of Alen<U+00E7>on, visited Elizabeth, who affectionately dubbed him "her frog" but, as always, proved elusive.</ref> After Catherine's daughter Elisabeth died in childbirth in 1568, she had touted her youngest daughter [[Margaret of Valois|Margaret]] as a bride for [[Philip II of Spain]]. Now she sought a marriage between Margaret and [[Henry III of Navarre]], with the aim of uniting Valois and Bourbon interests. Margaret, however, was secretly involved with [[Henry I, Duke of Guise|Henry of Guise]], the son of the late Duke of Guise. When Catherine found this out, she had her daughter brought from her bed. Catherine and the king then beat her, ripping her nightclothes and pulling out handfuls of her hair.<ref>Frieda, 257; Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 135.</ref>

Catherine pressed Jeanne d'Albret to attend court. Writing that she wanted to see Jeanne's children, she promised not to harm them. Jeanne replied: "Pardon me if, reading that, I want to laugh, because you want to relieve me of a fear that I've never had. I've never thought that, as they say, you eat little children".<ref>Bryson, 282.</ref> When Jeanne did come to court, Catherine pressured her hard,<ref>Jeanne d'Albret wrote to her son, Henry: "I am not free to talk with either the King or Madame, only the Queen Mother, who goads me [''me traite <U+00E1> la fourche'']&nbsp;... You have doubtless realized that their main object, my son, is to separate you from God, and from me". Quoted by Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 148<U+2013>49.</ref> playing on Jeanne's hopes for her beloved son. Jeanne finally agreed to the marriage between her son and Margaret, so long as Henry could remain a Huguenot. When Jeanne arrived in Paris to buy clothes for the wedding, she was taken ill and died, aged forty-four. Huguenot writers later accused Catherine of murdering her with poisoned gloves.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 151. An autopsy revealed tuberculosis and an abscess.</ref> The wedding took place on 18 August 1572 at [[Notre-Dame de Paris|Notre-Dame]], Paris.

====St. Bartholomew's Day massacre====
Three days later, [[Gaspard de Coligny|Admiral Coligny]] was walking back to his rooms from the Louvre when a shot rang out from a house and wounded him in the hand and arm.<ref>Sutherland, ''Massacre of St Bartholomew'', 313.</ref> A smoking arquebus was discovered in a window, but the culprit had made his escape from the rear of the building on a waiting horse.<ref>Frieda, 254, 304<U+2013>5; Holt, 83. The investigators traced the house and horse to the Guises and claimed to have found evidence that the would-be killer was [[Charles de Louviers de Maurevert]].</ref> Coligny was carried to his lodgings at the H<U+00F4>tel de B<U+00E9>thisy, where the surgeon [[Ambroise Par<U+00E9>]] removed a bullet from his elbow and amputated a damaged finger with a pair of scissors. Catherine, who was said to have received the news without emotion, made a tearful visit to Coligny and promised to punish his attacker. Many historians have blamed Catherine for the attack on Coligny. Others point to the Guise family or a Spanish-papal plot to end Coligny's influence on the king.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 154<U+2013>57. Coligny was lobbying the king to intervene against the empire in the Netherlands.<br /><U+2022> Frieda, 292. The Duke of Anjou was later reported as saying that he and Catherine had planned the assassination with Anne d'Este, who longed to avenge her husband, [[Francis, Duke of Guise]].<br /><U+2022> For an overview of historians' various interpretations, see Holt, 83<U+2013>4.</ref> Whatever the truth, the bloodbath that followed was soon beyond the control of Catherine or any other leader.<ref>Pettegree, 159<U+2013>60.</ref>

The [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre]], which began two days later, has stained Catherine's reputation ever since.<ref name="Pettegree, 154"/> There is no reason to believe she was not party to the decision when on 23 August Charles IX ordered, "Then kill them all! Kill them all!".<ref>Holt, 84.<br /><U+2022> [[Gaspard de Saulx|Marshal Tavannes]] recalled that Catherine had summoned a war council in the [[Tuileries Palace|Tuileries Gardens]] (so as not to be overheard) to plan the next move: "Because the attempt on the Admiral would cause a war, she, and the rest of us, agreed that it would be advisable to bring battle in Paris".  It is almost certain, however, that when Charles gave the order "Kill them all!", he meant those drawn up on a list by Catherine, and not, as has often been claimed, all Huguenots. Frieda, 306<U+2013>8.</ref> The thinking was clear. Catherine and her advisers expected a Huguenot uprising to revenge the attack on Coligny. They chose therefore to strike first and wipe out the Huguenot leaders while they were still in Paris after the wedding.<ref>Holt, 84.</ref>

The slaughter in Paris lasted for almost a week. It spread to many parts of France, where it persisted into the autumn. In the words of historian [[Jules Michelet]], "St Bartholomew was not a day, but a season".<ref>Quoted by Morris, 252.</ref> On 29 September, when Navarre knelt before the altar as a Roman Catholic, having converted to avoid being killed, Catherine turned to the ambassadors and laughed.<ref>Frieda, 324.</ref> From this time dates the legend of the wicked Italian queen. Huguenot writers branded Catherine a scheming Italian, who had acted on [[Niccol<U+00F2> Machiavelli|Machiavelli]]'s principles to kill all enemies in one blow.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 163<U+2013>64; Heller, 117; Manetsch, 60<U+2013>61. The [[misogyny]] and anti-Italianism in Huguenot "histories" proved seductive not only to Protestants but to Catholics seeking a [[scapegoat]] for France's woes.</ref>

[[Image:Anjou 1570louvre.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Henry III of France|Henry, Duke of Anjou]], by [[Jean de Court]], c. 1573. As [[Henry III of France|Henry III]], he often showed more interest in pious devotions than in government.]]

===Reign of Henry III===
Two years later, Catherine faced a new crisis with the death of Charles IX at the age of twenty-three. His dying words were "oh, my mother ...".<ref>Frieda, 350.</ref> The day before he died, he named Catherine regent, since his brother and heir, Henry the Duke of Anjou, was in the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], where he had been elected [[List of Polish monarchs#Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|king]] the year before. However three months after his coronation at [[Wawel Cathedral]], Henry abandoned that throne and returned to France in order to become king of France.  Catherine wrote to Henry: "I am grief-stricken to have witnessed such a scene and the love which he showed me at the end&nbsp;... My only consolation is to see you here soon, as your kingdom requires, and in good health, for if I were to lose you, I would have myself buried alive with you".<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 172.</ref>

Henry was Catherine's favourite son. Unlike his brothers, he came to the throne as a grown man. He was also healthier, though he suffered from weak lungs and constant fatigue.<ref>Frieda, 375.</ref> His interest in the tasks of government, however, proved fitful. He depended on Catherine and her team of secretaries until the last few weeks of her life. He often hid from state affairs, immersing himself in acts of piety, such as [[pilgrimage]]s and [[flagellation]].<ref>Sutherland, ''Secretaries of State'', 232, 240, 247.</ref>

Henry married [[Louise de Lorraine-Vaud<U+00E9>mont]] in February 1575, two days after his coronation. His choice thwarted Catherine's plans for a political marriage to a foreign princess. Rumours of Henry's inability to produce children were by that time in wide circulation. The papal [[nuncio]] Salviati observed, "it is only with difficulty that we can imagine there will be offspring&nbsp;... physicians and those who know him well say that he has an extremely weak constitution and will not live long".<ref>Frieda, 369.</ref> As time passed and the likelihood of children from the marriage receded, Catherine's youngest son, [[Francis, Duke of Anjou|Francis, Duke of Alen<U+00E7>on]], known as "Monsieur", played upon his role as heir to the throne, repeatedly exploiting the anarchy of the civil wars, which were by now as much about noble power struggles as religion.<ref>Sutherland, ''Ancien R<U+00E9>gime'', 22.</ref> Catherine did all in her power to bring Francis back into the fold. On one occasion, in March 1578, she lectured him for six hours about his dangerously subversive behaviour.<ref>Sutherland, ''Secretaries of State'', 205.</ref>

In 1576, in a move that endangered Henry's throne, Francis allied with the Protestant princes against the crown.<ref>Holt, 104.</ref> On 6 May 1576, Catherine gave in to almost all Huguenot demands in the [[Edict of Beaulieu]]. The treaty became known as the ''Peace of Monsieur'' because it was thought that Francis had forced it on the crown.<ref>Holt, 105<U+2013>6; Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 186; Frieda, 384<U+2013>87.</ref> Francis died of [[tuberculosis|consumption]] in June 1584, after a disastrous intervention in the Low Countries during which his army had been massacred.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 212<U+2013>13; Frieda, 406<U+2013>7.</ref> Catherine wrote, the next day: "I am so wretched to live long enough to see so many people die before me, although I realize that God's will must be obeyed, that He owns everything, and that he lends us only for as long as He likes the children whom He gives us".<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 217.</ref> The death of her youngest son was a calamity for Catherine's dynastic dreams. Under [[Salic law]], by which only males could ascend the throne, the Huguenot Henry of Navarre now became heir presumptive to the French crown.<ref name="Pettegree, 154"/>

[[Image:Nicholas Hilliard 002.jpg|thumb|upright|Catherine's youngest son, [[Francis, Duke of Anjou|Francis, Duke of Alen<U+00E7>on]], by [[Nicholas Hilliard]], c. 1577. [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth of England]] called him "her frog" but found him "not so deformed" as she had been led to expect.<ref>Frieda, 397.</ref>]]

Catherine had at least taken the precaution of marrying Margaret, her youngest daughter, to Navarre. Margaret, however, became almost as much of a thorn in Catherine's side as Francis, and in 1582, she returned to the French court without her husband. Catherine was heard yelling at her for taking lovers.<ref>Frieda, 404.</ref> Catherine sent [[Pomponne de Belli<U+00E8>vre]] to Navarre to arrange Margaret's return. In 1585, Margaret fled Navarre again.<ref>Frieda, 414.</ref> She retreated to her property at [[Agen]] and begged her mother for money. Catherine sent her only enough "to put food on her table".<ref>Frieda, 415.</ref> Moving on to the fortress of Carlat, Margaret took a lover called d'Aubiac. Catherine asked Henry to act before Margaret brought shame on them again. In October 1586, therefore, he had Margaret locked up in the [[Ch<U+00E2>teau d'Usson]]. D'Aubiac was executed, though not, despite Catherine's wish, in front of Margaret.<ref>Frieda, 416; Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 254<U+2013>55.</ref> Catherine cut Margaret out of her will and never saw her again.

Catherine was unable to control Henry in the way she had Francis and Charles.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 189; Frieda, 389.</ref> Her role in his government became that of chief executive and roving diplomat. She travelled widely across the kingdom, enforcing his authority and trying to head off war. In 1578, she took on the task of pacifying the south. At the age of fifty-nine, she embarked on an eighteen-month journey around the south of France to meet Huguenot leaders face to face. Her efforts won Catherine new respect from the French people.<ref>Sutherland, ''Secretaries of State'', 209; Frieda, 392.</ref> On her return to Paris in 1579, she was greeted outside the city by the Parlement and crowds. The Venetian ambassador, Gerolamo Lipomanno, wrote: "She is an indefatigable princess, born to tame and govern a people as unruly as the French: they now recognize her merits, her concern for unity and are sorry not to have appreciated her sooner".<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 200.</ref> She was under no illusions, however. On 25 November 1579, she wrote to the king, "You are on the eve of a general revolt. Anyone who tells you differently is a liar".<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 201.</ref>

====Catholic League====
[[Image:Henry, third duke of Guise.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Henry I, Duke of Guise|Henry, Duke of Guise]], by Pierre Dumo<U+00FB>tier. Disarmed by Catherine's sweetness on meeting her for negotiations at [[<U+00C9>pernay]] in 1585, Guise tearfully insisted that his motives had been misunderstood. Catherine told him it would be better if he took off his boots and ate something, after which they could talk at length.<ref>Frieda, 412.</ref>]]

Many leading Roman Catholics were appalled by Catherine's attempts to appease the Huguenots. After the Edict of Beaulieu, they had started forming local leagues to protect their religion.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 185; Frieda, 386.</ref> The death of the heir to the throne in 1584 prompted the Duke of Guise to assume the leadership of the [[Catholic League (French)|Catholic League]]. He planned to block Henry of Navarre's succession and place Henry's Catholic uncle [[Charles, Cardinal de Bourbon|Cardinal Charles de Bourbon]] on the throne instead. In this cause, he recruited the great Catholic princes, nobles and prelates, signed the [[treaty of Joinville]] with Spain, and prepared to make war on the "heretics".<ref>Pettegree, 164.</ref> By 1585, Henry III had no choice but to go to war against the League.<ref>Sutherland, ''Secretaries of State'', 255.</ref> As Catherine put it, "peace is carried on a stick" (''b<U+00E2>ton porte paix'').<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 249; Frieda, 412.</ref> "Take care", she wrote to the king, "especially about your person. There is so much treachery about that I die of fear".<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 251.</ref>

Henry was unable to fight the Catholics and the Protestants at once, both of whom had stronger armies than his own. In the [[Treaty of Nemours]], signed on 7 July 1585, he was forced to give in to all the League's demands, even that he pay its troops.<ref>Knecht, ''Renaissance France'', 440.</ref> He went into hiding to fast and pray, surrounded by a bodyguard known as "[[The forty-five guards|the Forty-five]]", and left Catherine to sort out the mess.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 253.</ref> The monarchy had lost control of the country, and was in no position to assist England in the face of the coming Spanish attack. The Spanish ambassador told Philip II that the abscess was about to burst.<ref>Sutherland, ''Secretaries of State'', 287.</ref>

By 1587, the Catholic backlash against the Protestants had become  a campaign across Europe. [[Elizabeth I of England]]'s execution of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], on 18 February 1587 outraged the Catholic world.<ref>Frieda, 420; Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 257.</ref> [[Philip II of Spain]] prepared for an invasion of England. The League took control of much of northern France to secure French ports for his [[Spanish Armada|armada]].

====Last months and death====
[[Image:Catherine de Medicis.jpg|thumb|upright|Catherine de' Medici, by [[Fran<U+00E7>ois Clouet]]. As a widow, Catherine wore a widow's cap or a [[French hood]]. At the back of her ruff stood a high black collar; and she wore a wide black shirt, pointed bodice, and enormous winged sleeves. "Over all this flowed a long black mantle".<ref>Frieda, 362<U+2013>63.</ref>]]

Henry hired Swiss troops to help him defend himself in Paris. The Parisians, however, claimed the right to defend the city themselves. On 12 May 1588, they set up barricades in the streets and refused to take orders from anyone except the Duke of Guise.<ref>"[[Day of the Barricades|The Day of the Barricades]]", as the revolt became known, "reduced the authority and prestige of the monarchy  to its lowest ebb for a century and a half". Morris, 260.</ref> When Catherine tried to go to mass, she found her way barred, though she was allowed through the barricades. The chronicler L'Estoile reported that she cried all through her lunch that day. She wrote to Belli<U+00E8>vre, "Never have I seen myself in such trouble or with so little light by which to escape".<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 263.</ref>  As usual, Catherine advised the king, who had fled the city in the nick of time, to compromise and live to fight another day.<ref>Frieda, 432.</ref> On 15 June 1588, Henry duly signed the Act of Union, which gave in to all the League's latest demands.

On 8 September 1588 at Blois, where the court had assembled for a meeting of the Estates, Henry dismissed all his ministers without warning. Catherine, in bed with a lung infection, had been kept in the dark.<ref>Henry wrote a note to Villeroy, which began: "Villeroy, I remain very well contented with your service; do not fail however to go away to your house where you will stay until I send for you; do not seek the reason for this my letter, but obey me". Sutherland, ''Secretaries of State'', 300<U+2013>3.</ref> The king's actions effectively ended her days of power.

At the meeting of the Estates, Henry thanked Catherine for all she had done. He called her not only the mother of the king but the mother of the state.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 264<U+2013>65.</ref> Henry did not tell Catherine of his plan for a solution to his problems. On 23 December 1588, he asked the Duke of Guise to call on him at the [[Ch<U+00E2>teau de Blois|Ch<U+00E2>teau of Blois]]. As Guise entered the king's chamber, the Forty-five plunged their blades into his body, and he died at the foot of the king's bed. At the same moment, eight members of the Guise family were rounded up, including the Duke of Guise's brother, [[Louis II, Cardinal of Guise]], whom Henry's men hacked to death the next day in the palace dungeons.<ref>Pettegree, 165.</ref> Immediately after the murder of Guise, Henry entered Catherine's bedroom on the floor below and announced, "Please forgive me. Monsieur de Guise is dead. He will not be spoken of again. I have had him killed. I have done to him what he was going to do to me".<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 266. The words were reported to the government of Florence by Catherine's doctor, Filippo Cavriana, who acted as their informant.</ref> Catherine's immediate reaction is not known; but on Christmas Day, she told a friar, "Oh, wretched man! What has he done?...Pray for him...I see him rushing towards his ruin".<ref name = K267>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 267.</ref> She visited her old friend Cardinal de Bourbon on 1 January 1589 to tell him she was sure he would soon be freed. He shouted at her, "Your words, Madam, have led us all to this butchery".<ref name = K267/> She left in tears.

On 5 January 1589, Catherine died at the age of sixty-nine, probably from [[pleurisy]]. L'Estoile wrote: "those close to her believed that her life had been shortened by displeasure over her son's deed".<ref name = K269>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 268<U+2013>69.</ref> He added that she had no sooner died than she was treated with as much consideration as a dead goat. Because Paris was held by enemies of the crown, Catherine had to be buried at Blois. [[Diane de France|Diane]], daughter of Henry II and Philippa Duci, later had her body moved to [[Basilique Saint-Denis|Saint-Denis basilica]]. In 1793, a revolutionary mob tossed her bones into a mass grave with those of the other kings and queens.<ref name = K269>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 269.</ref> Eight months after Catherine's burial, a friar called [[Jacques Cl<U+00E9>ment]] stabbed Henry III to death. At the time, Henry was besieging Paris with the King of Navarre, who [[Henry IV of France's succession|succeeded him as Henry IV of France]], ending nearly three centuries of [[House of Valois|Valois]] rule and bringing in the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon dynasty]].

Henry IV was later reported to have said of Catherine:

<blockquote>I ask you, what could a woman do, left by the death of her husband with five little children on her arms, and two families of France who were thinking of grasping the crown<U+2014>our own [the Bourbons] and the Guises? Was she not compelled to play strange parts to deceive first one and then the other, in order to guard, as she did, her sons, who successively reigned through the wise conduct of that shrewd woman? I am surprised that she never did worse.<ref>Brant<U+00F4>me, 88.</ref></blockquote>

==Patron of the arts==
{{Main|Catherine de' Medici's patronage of the arts| Catherine de' Medici's building projects| Catherine de' Medici's court festivals}}
[[Image:Caron-Antoine-triumph-of-winter.jpg|thumb|350px|left|''Triumph of Winter'', by [[Antoine Caron]], c. 1568]]
Catherine believed in the [[Renaissance humanism|humanist]] ideal of the learned Renaissance prince whose authority depended on letters as well as arms.<ref>Hoogvliet, 109.</ref> She was inspired by the example of her father-in-law, [[Francis I of France|King Francis I of France]], who had hosted the leading artists of Europe at his court, and by her [[Medici]] ancestors. In an age of civil war and declining respect for the monarchy, she sought to bolster royal prestige through lavish cultural display. Once in control of the royal purse, she launched a programme of artistic patronage that lasted for three decades. During this time, she presided over a distinctive late [[French Renaissance]] culture in all branches of the arts.<ref>Knecht, 220.</ref>

An [[inventory]] drawn up at the [[H<U+00F4>tel de la Reine]] after Catherine's death shows her to have been a keen collector. Listed works of art included [[tapestry|tapestries]], hand-drawn maps, sculptures, rich fabrics, [[ebony]] furniture inlaid with [[ivory]], sets of china, and [[Limoges]] pottery.<ref>Knecht, 240<U+2013>41.</ref> There were also hundreds of portraits, for which a vogue had developed during Catherine's lifetime. Many portraits in her collection were by [[Jean Clouet]] (1480<U+2013>1541) and his son [[Fran<U+00E7>ois Clouet]] (c. 1510<U+2013>1572). Fran<U+00E7>ois Clouet drew and painted portraits of all Catherine's family and of many members of the court.<ref>Dimier, 205<U+2013>6.</ref> After Catherine's death, a decline in the quality of French portraiture set in. By 1610, the school patronised by the late Valois court and brought to its pinnacle by Fran<U+00E7>ois Clouet had all but died out.<ref>Dimier, 308<U+2013>19; Jollet, 17<U+2013>18.</ref>

Beyond portraiture, little is known about the painting at Catherine de' Medici's court.<ref name="biic"/> In the last two decades of her life, only two painters stand out as recognisable personalities: [[Jehan Cousin the younger|Jean Cousin the Younger]] (c. 1522<U+2013>c. 1594), few of whose works survive, and [[Antoine Caron]] (c. 1521<U+2013>1599), who became Catherine's official painter after working at [[Fontainebleau]] under [[Francesco Primaticcio|Primaticcio]]. Caron's vivid [[Mannerism]], with its love of ceremonial and its preoccupation with massacres, reflects the neurotic atmosphere of the French court during the [[French Wars of Religion|Wars of Religion]].<ref>Blunt calls Caron's style "perhaps the purest known type of Mannerism in its elegant form, appropriate to an exquisite but neurotic society". Blunt, 98, 100.</ref>

Many of Caron's paintings, such as those of the ''Triumphs of the Seasons'', are of [[allegory|allegorical]] subjects that echo the [[Catherine de' Medici's court festivals|festivities]] for which Catherine's court was famous. His designs for the [[Valois Tapestries]] celebrate the ''f<U+00EA>tes'', picnics, and mock battles of the "magnificent" entertainments hosted by Catherine. They depict events held at Fontainebleau in 1564; at [[Bayonne]] in 1565 for the summit meeting with the Spanish court; and at the [[Tuileries Palace|Tuileries]] in 1573 for the visit of the Polish ambassadors who presented the Polish crown to Catherine's son [[Henry III of France|Henry of Anjou]].<ref name = "biic">Blunt, 98.</ref> Biographer Leonie Frieda suggests that "Catherine, more than anyone, inaugurated the fantastic entertainments for which later French monarchs also became renowned".<ref name =FF>Frieda, 225.</ref>
[[Image:Ballet 1582.png|thumb|200px|upright|The ''[[Ballet Comique de la Reine]]'', from an engraving of 1582 by Jacques Patin]]
The musical shows in particular allowed Catherine to express her creative gifts. They were usually dedicated to the ideal of peace in the realm and based on [[Mythology|mythological]] themes. To create the necessary dramas, music, and scenic effects for these events, Catherine employed the leading artists and architects of the day. Historian Frances Yates has called her "a great creative artist in festivals".<ref>Yates, 68.</ref> Catherine gradually introduced changes to the traditional entertainments: for example, she increased the prominence of dance in the shows that climaxed each series of entertainments. A distinctive new art form, the ''[[ballets de cour|ballet de cour]]'', emerged from these creative advances.<ref>Yates, 51; Strong, 102, 121<U+2013>22.</ref> Owing to its synthesis of dance, music, verse, and setting, the production of the ''[[Ballet Comique de la Reine]]'' in 1581 is regarded by scholars as the first authentic ballet.<ref>Lee, 44.</ref>

Catherine de' Medici's great love among the arts was architecture.  "As the daughter of the Medici", suggests French art historian Jean-Pierre Babelon, "she was driven by a passion to build and a desire to leave great achievements behind her when she died."<ref>Babelon, 263.</ref> After Henry II's death, Catherine set out to immortalise her husband's memory and to  enhance the grandeur of the Valois monarchy through a series of costly building projects.<ref>Frieda, 79, 455; Sutherland, ''Ancien R<U+00E9>gime'', 6.</ref> These included work on ch<U+00E2>teaux at Montceaux-en-Brie, [[Saint-Maur-des-Foss<U+00E9>s]], and Chenonceau. Catherine built two new palaces in Paris: the Tuileries and the H<U+00F4>tel de la Reine. She was closely involved in the planning and supervising of all her architectural schemes.<ref>Knecht, 228.</ref>

Catherine had emblems of her love and grief carved into the stonework of her buildings.<ref>Knecht, 223.</ref> Poets lauded her as the new Artemisia, after [[Artemisia II of Caria]], who built the [[Mausoleum of Maussollos|Mausoleum]] at [[Halicarnassus]] as a tomb for her dead husband.<ref>Frieda, 266; Hoogvliet, 108.</ref> As the centrepiece of an ambitious new chapel, she commissioned a magnificent tomb for Henry at the basilica of Saint Denis. It was designed by [[Francesco Primaticcio]] (1504<U+2013>1570), with sculpture by Germain Pilon (1528<U+2013>1590). Art historian Henri Zerner has called this monument "the last and most brilliant of the royal tombs of the Renaissance".<ref name = "zccclxxvix">Zerner, 379.</ref> Catherine also commissioned [[Germain Pilon]] to carve the marble sculpture that contains Henry II's heart. A poem by Ronsard, engraved on its base, tells the reader not to wonder that so small a vase can hold so large a heart, since Henry's real heart resides in Catherine's breast.<ref>Hoogvliet, 111. Ronsard may be referring to Artemisia, who drank the ashes of her dead husband, which became part of her own body.</ref>

Although Catherine spent ruinous sums on the arts,<ref>Thomson, 168.</ref> most of her patronage left no permanent legacy.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 244.</ref> The end of the Valois dynasty so soon after her death brought a change in priorities.
