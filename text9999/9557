'''Fantasy tracks not available for [[Personal Computer|PC]].'''

==Modes==
===Career Mode===
*  Work your way through the ranks of NASCAR as you compete for 20 consecutive seasons. Vie for the best crew, try to sign the top sponsors, and incorporate the latest racing technology. If you want to be offered a good sponsor and money for your team, buy new engines, chassis, body and your R&D (reseach and development)... you need to race smarter and finish in a good position to do so. If your starting and finishing position meets your sponsor's expectation, your prestige will raise, and maybe you will be offered better money and sponsor.

===Season Mode===
*  You don't have to win every race to finish the season on top. Compete consistently in a series of races in quest of a NASCAR championship and you might end up with enough points to clutch the cup.

===Thunder License===
*  Get some experience behind the wheel as you learn every track in the country from "The King," Richard Petty, and other top NASCAR drivers. This is pretty much like the practice mode in "Race Now." Except that you don't have an option to mess with your setups.

===Lightning Challenge===
*  Lightning Challenge is your chance to prove you belong on the track. If You can complete the challenges, you'll earn Thunder Plates which unlock cars, tracks, and drivers. Michael Waltrip, driver of the #15 NAPA Chevrolet, will be your commentator for all of the challenges but one comentated by Steve Park. To find out what plates you can get from all of the challenges, look under "Thunder Plates".


== Grudges And Alliances ==
* There is a feature in the game called Grudges and Alliances. Where the player can share draft with the cars around him to gain an alliance with the driver. If the player wrecks a driver, they will pay them back with a bump. The downside to the feature is the drivers will intentionally wreck their cars to wreck the player and also the drivers will get angry over the least bit of rubbing and bumping, which can get frustrating for some gamers.
