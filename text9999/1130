'''USS ''Wisconsin'' (BB-64)''', "Wisky" or "WisKy", is an {{Sclass|Iowa|battleship}}, the second ship of the [[United States Navy]] to be named in honor of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Wisconsin]]. She was built at the [[Philadelphia Naval Shipyard]] in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]] and [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on 7 December 1943 (the second anniversary of the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor raid]]), sponsored by the wife of Governor of [[Wisconsin]], [[Walter Goodland]].

During her career, ''Wisconsin'' served in the [[Pacific War|Pacific Theater]] of [[World War II]], where she shelled [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] [[fortifications]] and screened United States [[aircraft carrier]]s as they conducted [[airstrike|air raids]] against enemy positions. During the [[Korean War]], ''Wisconsin'' shelled [[North Korean]] targets in support of [[United Nations]] and [[South Korea]]n ground operations, after which she was [[ship decommissioning|decommissioned]]. She was reactivated 1 August 1986, modernised and participated in [[Operation Desert Storm]] in January and February 1991.

''Wisconsin'' was last decommissioned in September 1991, having earned a total of six [[service star|battle stars]] for service in World War II and Korea, as well as a [[Navy Unit Commendation]] for service during the January/February 1991 [[Gulf War]]. She currently functions as a museum ship operated by [[Nauticus, The National Maritime Center]] in [[Norfolk, Virginia]]. ''Wisconsin'' was struck from the [[Naval Vessel Register]] (NVR) 17 March 2006, and, as of 14 December 2009, has been donated for permanent use as a [[museum ship]]. On 15 April 2010, the City of Norfolk officially took over ownership of the ship.<ref name="Ship">{{cite news

==Construction==
{{Main|Iowa class battleship|Armament of the Iowa class battleship}}

''Wisconsin'' was one of the "[[fast battleship]]" designs planned in 1938 by the Preliminary Design Branch at the [[Bureau of Construction and Repair]]. She was the third of four completed ships of the [[Iowa class battleship|''Iowa'' class]] of [[battleship]]s.<ref name="Order">{{cite web | title = Naval Vessel Register | url = http://www.nvr.navy.mil/nvrships/details/BB64.htm | work = |publisher= [[United States Navy]] | accessdate=17 December 2006}}</ref> Her [[keel]] was laid down on 25 January 1941, at the [[Philadelphia Navy Yard]]. She was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on 7 December 1943, sponsored by Mrs. Goodland, wife of [[Walter Samuel Goodland|Walter S. Goodland]], the [[List of Governors of Wisconsin|Governor of Wisconsin]], and [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 16 April 1944, with Captain [[Earl E. Stone]] in command.<ref name="DANFS">{{cite web | title = USS Wisconsin (BB 64) History | url = http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/w10/wisconsin-ii.htm | work = [[Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships]]|publisher= [[United States Navy]] | accessdate=26 November 2006}}</ref><ref name="USS Wisconsin">{{cite web | title = The USS Wisconsin (BB-64) Ship's History | url = http://www.usswisconsin.org/General/Ships%20History.htm |publisher= USS Wisconsin Association |accessdate=26 November 2006}}</ref>

''Wisconsin''{{'}}s main battery consisted of nine [[16"/50 caliber Mark 7 gun|{{convert|16|in|mm|abbr=on}}/50 cal Mark 7 gun]]s, which could hurl {{convert|2700|lb|abbr=on}} armor-piercing shells some {{convert|20|mi|km|abbr=on}}. Her secondary battery consisted of 20 [[5"/38 caliber gun|{{convert|5|in|mm|abbr=on}}/38 cal gun]]s in ten twin turrets, which could fire at targets up to {{convert|10|mi|km|abbr=on}} away. With the advent of air power and the need to gain and maintain [[air superiority]] came a need to protect the growing fleet of allied aircraft carriers; to this end, ''Wisconsin'' was fitted with an array of [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|Oerlikon 20 mm]] and [[Bofors 40 mm]] [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft guns]] to defend allied carriers from enemy airstrikes. When reactivated in 1986, ''Wisconsin'' had her 20&nbsp;mm and 40&nbsp;mm AA guns removed, and was outfitted with [[Phalanx CIWS]] mounts for protection against enemy missiles and aircraft, and [[Armored Box Launcher]]s and Quad Cell Launchers designed to fire [[Tomahawk missile]]s and [[Harpoon missile]]s, respectively.<ref name="The Battleships I">{{cite book | last =Johnston, Ian & McAuley, Rob | title =The Battleships | publisher =Channel 4 Books (an imprint of Pan Macmillian, LTD) | year =2002 | location =London | page =120 | url = http://www.panmacmillan.com/ | isbn =0-7522-6188-6}}</ref>

''Wisconsin'' is numerically the highest numbered US battleship built.  Although her keel was laid after the ''[[USS Missouri (BB-63)]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s, she was commissioned before the {{USS|Missouri|BB-63|2}}'s commissioning date.<ref name="Order"/><ref name="63 64 compare">''Wisconsin'' was commissioned on 16 April 1944 [http://www.nvr.navy.mil/nvrships/details/BB64.htm], while ''Missouri'' was commissioned on 11 June of the same year.[http://www.nvr.navy.mil/nvrships/details/BB63.htm]</ref> Thus, ''Wisconsin''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s construction began after ''Missouri''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s, and finished earlier.

==World War II (1944<U+2013>1945)==

===Shakedown and service with 3rd Fleet, Admiral Halsey===
After the ship's trials and initial training in the [[Chesapeake Bay]], ''Wisconsin'' departed [[Norfolk, Virginia]], on 7 July 1944, bound for the [[British West Indies]]. Following her [[shakedown cruise]] (conducted out of [[Trinidad]]) she returned to the builder's yard for alterations and repairs.<ref name="DANFS"/>

On 24 September 1944, ''Wisconsin'' sailed for the west coast, transiting the [[Panama Canal]], and reporting for duty with the [[United States Pacific Fleet|Pacific Fleet]] on 2 October. The battleship later moved to [[Hawaii]]an waters for training exercises and then headed for the Western [[Caroline Islands]]. Upon reaching the Caroline Island [[Ulithi]] she joined [[Admiral]] [[William F. Halsey]]'s [[United States Third Fleet|3rd Fleet]] on 9 December.<ref name="DANFS"/><ref>William F. Halsey held the rank of a four star Admiral throughout the Second World War. In December of 1945, four months after the official surrender of the Japanese, he was promoted to the rank of [[Fleet Admiral (United States)|Fleet Admiral]] and awarded his fifth star. [http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq36-5.htm Source]</ref>

Due to the length of time it took to build, ''Wisconsin'' missed much of the initial thrust into Japanese-held territory, having arrived at a time when the reconquest of the [[Philippines]] was well underway. As a part of that movement, the planners had envisioned landings on the southwest coast of [[Mindoro]], south of [[Luzon]]. From that point, American forces could threaten Japanese shipping lanes through the [[South China Sea]]. In preparation for the coming invasion of Mindoro, ''Wisconsin'' was assigned to protect the 3rd Fleet's [[Fast Carrier Task Force]] (TF 38), as they conducted air raids at [[Manila]] to soften up Japanese positions.<ref name="DANFS"/>

On 18 December, the ships of TF 38 unexpectedly found themselves in a fight for their lives when [[Typhoon Cobra (1944)|Typhoon Cobra]] overtook the force<U+2013>seven fleet and six light carriers, eight battleships, 15 cruisers, and about 50 [[destroyer]]s<U+2013>during their attempt to refuel at sea. At the time the ships were operating about {{convert|300|mi|km|abbr=on}} east of Luzon in the [[Philippine Sea]].<ref name="PT">{{cite web | title = Typhoons and Hurricanes: Pacific Typhoon, 18 December 1944 | url = http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq102-4.htm | work = |publisher= United States Navy | accessdate=8 January 2006}}</ref> The carriers had just completed three days of heavy raids against Japanese airfields, suppressing enemy aircraft during the American [[amphibious assault|amphibious operations]] against [[Mindoro]] in the Philippines. The task force rendezvoused with [[Captain (U.S. Navy)|Captain]] Jasper T. Acuff and his fueling group 17 December with the intention of refueling all ships in the task force and replacing lost aircraft.<ref name="Cobra">{{cite web | title = Third Fleet in Typhoon Cobra, December 1944 | url = http://www.compass.dircon.co.uk/cobra2.htm  | work = History of US Naval Operations in World War II |publisher= Samuel Eliot Morison | accessdate=8 January 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20051018002436/http://www.compass.dircon.co.uk/cobra2.htm |archivedate = 18 October 2005}}</ref> Although the sea had been growing rougher all day, the nearby cyclonic disturbance gave relatively little warning of its approach. On 18 December, the small but violent typhoon overtook the Task Force while many of the ships were attempting to refuel. Many of the ships were caught near the center of the storm and buffeted by extreme seas and hurricane force winds. Three destroyers, {{USS|Hull|DD-350|2}}, {{USS|Monaghan|DD-354|2}}, and {{USS|Spence|DD-512|2}}, capsized and sank with nearly all hands, while a cruiser, five aircraft carriers, and three destroyers suffered serious damage.<ref name="PT"/> Approximately 790 officers and men were lost or killed, with another 80 injured. Fires occurred in three carriers when planes broke loose in their hangars and some 146 planes on various ships were lost or damaged beyond economical repair by fires, impact damage, or by being swept overboard.<ref name="Cobra"/> ''Wisconsin'' reported two injured sailors as a result of the typhoon,<ref>{{cite web | title = Pacific Typhoon, 18 December: Personnel Casualties Suffered by Third Fleet, 17<U+2013>18 December 1944, Compiled from Official Sources | url = http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq102-4c.htm | work = |publisher= United States Navy | accessdate=8 January 2006}}</ref> but otherwise proved her seaworthiness as she escaped the storm unscathed.<ref name="DANFS"/><ref name="Cobra"/>

''Wisconsin''{{'}}s next operation was to assist with the occupation of Luzon. Bypassing the southern beaches, American amphibious forces went ashore at [[Lingayen Gulf]], the scene of initial Japanese assaults to take Luzon nearly three years before.<ref name="DANFS"/>

''Wisconsin'', armed with heavy anti-aircraft batteries, performed escort duty for TF 38's fast carriers during air strikes against [[Taiwan|Formosa]], Luzon, and the [[Nansei Shoto]] to neutralize Japanese forces there and to cover the unfolding Allied Lingayen Gulf operations. Those strikes, lasting from 3<U+2013>22 January 1945, included a thrust into the South China Sea, in the hope that major units of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] could be drawn into battle.<ref name="DANFS"/>

''Wisconsin''{{'}}s carrier group launched air strikes between [[Saigon]] and [[Camranh Bay]], [[French Indochina]], on 12 January, resulting in severe losses for the enemy. TF 38's warplanes sank 41 ships and heavily damaged docks, storage areas, and aircraft facilities. Formosa, already struck on 3<U+2013>4 January, was raided again on 9 January 15 January, and 21 January. Throughout January ''Wisconsin'' shielded the carriers as they conducted air raids at [[Hong Kong]], [[Guangzhou|Canton]], [[Hainan Island]], the Canton [[oil refinery|oil refineries]], the Hong Kong Naval Station, and [[Okinawa]].<ref name="DANFS"/>

===Service with 5th Fleet, Admiral Spruance===
''Wisconsin'' was assigned to the [[United States Fifth Fleet|5th Fleet]] when Admiral [[Raymond A. Spruance]] relieved Admiral Halsey as Commander of the Fleet. She moved northward with the redesignated TF 58 as the carriers headed for the Tokyo area. On 16 February, the task force approached the Japanese coast under cover of adverse weather conditions and achieved complete tactical surprise. As a result, ''Wisconsin'' and the other ships shot down 322 enemy planes and destroyed 177 more on the ground. Japanese shipping, both naval and merchant, also suffered drastically, as did hangars and aircraft installations.<ref name="DANFS"/>

''Wisconsin'' and the task force moved to [[Iwo Jima]] on 17 February to provide direct support for the landings slated to take place on 19 February. They revisited [[Tokyo]] on 25 February and hit the island of [[Hachinohe, Aomori|Hachino]] off the coast of [[Honsh<U+016B>]] the next day, resulting in heavy damage to ground facilities; additionally, American planes sank five small vessels and destroyed 158 planes.<ref name="DANFS"/>

''Wisconsin''{{'}}s task force stood out of [[Ulithi]] on 14 March bound for Japan. The mission of that group was to eliminate airborne resistance from the Japanese homeland to American forces off Okinawa. Enemy fleet units at [[Kure, Hiroshima|Kure]] and [[Kobe]], on southern Honsh<U+016B>, reeled under the impact of the explosive blows delivered by TF 58's airmen. On 18<U+2013>19 March, from a point {{convert|100|mi|km|abbr=on}} southwest of [[Ky<U+016B>sh<U+016B>]], TF 58 hit enemy airfields on that island; unfortunately, allied anti-aircraft fire on 19 March failed to stop an attack on the carrier {{USS|Franklin|CV-13|2}}. That afternoon, ''Wisconsin'' and the task force retired from Ky<U+016B>sh<U+016B>, screening the blazing and battered flattop, and shooting down 48 attackers.<ref name="DANFS"/>

On 24 March, ''Wisconsin'' trained her {{convert|16|in|mm|abbr=on}} guns on targets ashore on [[Okinawa]]. Together with the other battle-wagons of the task force, she pounded Japanese positions and installations in preparation for the landings. Japanese resistance, while fierce, was doomed to failure by dwindling numbers of aircraft and trained pilots.<ref name="DANFS"/>

[[Image:WWII Wisconsin.JPG|thumb|left|''Wisconsin'' escorting US ''Essex''-class aircraft carriers in the [[Pacific Ocean]] during [[World War II]]. The tail crane was used to recover reconnaissance planes launched by ''Wisconsin''.]]

While TF 58's planes were dealing with {{Ship|Japanese battleship|Yamato||2}} and her escorts, enemy aircraft attacked the American surface units. Combat air patrols (CAP) shot down 15 enemy planes, and ships' gunfire shot down another three, but not before one ''[[kamikaze]]'' attack penetrated the CAP and screen to crash on the flight deck of the fleet carrier {{USS|Hancock|CV-19|2}}. On 11 April, the Japanese renewed their ''kamikaze'' attacks; and only drastic maneuvers and heavy barrages of gunfire saved the task force. Combat air patrols shot down 17 planes, and ships' gunfire shot down 12. The next day, 151 enemy aircraft attacked TF 58, but ''Wisconsin'', together with other units of the screens for the vital carriers, kept the ''kamikaze'' pilots at bay and destroyed them before they could reach their targets. Over the days that ensued, Japanese ''kamikaze'' attacks managed to crash into three carriers<U+2014>{{USS|Intrepid|CV-11|2}}, {{USS|Bunker Hill|CV-17|2}} and {{USS|Enterprise|CV-6|2}}<U+2014>on successive days.<ref name="DANFS"/>

By 4 June, a typhoon was swirling through the Fleet. ''Wisconsin'' rode out the storm unscathed, but three cruisers, two carriers, and a destroyer suffered serious damage. Offensive operations were resumed on 8 June with a final aerial assault on Ky<U+016B>sh<U+016B>. Japanese aerial response was virtually nonexistent; 29 planes were located and destroyed. On that day, one of ''Wisconsin''{{'}}s [[floatplane]]s landed and rescued a downed pilot from the carrier {{USS|Shangri-La|CV-38|2}}.<ref name="DANFS"/>

===Bombardment of Japan===
{{see also|Allied naval bombardments of Japan during World War II}}

''Wisconsin'' ultimately put into [[Leyte Gulf]] and dropped anchor there on 13 June for repairs and replenishment. Three weeks later, on 1 July, the battleship and her escorts sailed once more for Japanese home waters for carrier air strikes on the enemy's heartland. Nine days later, carrier planes from TF 38 destroyed 72 enemy aircraft on the ground and smashed industrial sites in the Tokyo area. ''Wisconsin'' and the other ships made no attempt whatsoever to conceal the location of their armada, due in large part to a weak Japanese response to their presence.<ref name="DANFS"/>

On 16 July, ''Wisconsin'' fired her {{convert|16|in|mm|abbr=on}} guns at the [[steel mill]]s and [[oil refinery|oil refineries]] at [[Muroran]], Hokkaido. Two days later, she wrecked industrial facilities in the [[Hitachi Province|Hitachi Miro]] area, on the coast of Honsh<U+016B>-, northeast of Tokyo itself. During that bombardment, [[United Kingdom|British]] battleships of the [[British Pacific Fleet]] contributed their heavy shellfire. By that point in the war, Allied warships such as ''Wisconsin'' were able to shell the Japanese homeland almost at will.<ref name="DANFS"/>

TF 38's planes subsequently blasted the Japanese naval base at [[Yokosuka]], and put the former fleet flagship [[Japanese battleship Nagato|''Nagato'']] out of action, one of the two remaining Japanese battleships. Throughout July and into August, Admiral Halsey's airmen visited destruction upon the Japanese, the last instance being against Tokyo on 13 August. Two days later, the Japanese surrendered, ending World War II.<ref name="DANFS"/>

''Wisconsin'', as part of the occupying force, arrived at Tokyo Bay on 5 September, three days after the formal surrender occurred on board the battleship {{USS|Missouri|BB-63|2}}. During ''Wisconsin''{{'}}s brief career in World War II, she had steamed {{convert|105831|mi|km|abbr=on}} since commissioning; had shot down three enemy planes; had claimed assists on four occasions; and had fueled her screening destroyers on some 250 occasions.<ref name="DANFS"/>

===Post World War II (1945<U+2013>1950)===
Shifting subsequently to [[Okinawa]], the battleship embarked homeward-bound GIs on 22 September 1945, as part of [[Operation Magic Carpet]] staged to bring soldiers, sailors, and marines home from the far-flung battlefronts of the Pacific. Departing Okinawa on 23 September, ''Wisconsin'' reached [[Pearl Harbor]] on 4 October, remaining there for five days before she pushed on for the west coast on the last leg of her state-side bound voyage. She reached [[San Francisco, California]] on 15 October.<ref name="DANFS"/>

Heading for the east coast of the United States soon after the start of the new year, 1946, ''Wisconsin'' transited the [[Panama Canal]] from 11<U+2013>13 January and reached [[Hampton Roads]], [[Virginia]] on 18 January. Following a cruise south to [[Guant<U+00E1>namo Bay]], [[Cuba]], the battleship entered the [[Norfolk Naval Shipyard]] for overhaul. After repairs and alterations that consumed the summer months, ''Wisconsin'' sailed for [[South America]]n waters.<ref name="DANFS"/>

Over the weeks that ensued, the battleship visited [[Valpara<U+00ED>so]], [[Chile]], from 1<U+2013>6 November; [[Callao]], [[Peru]], from 9<U+2013>13 November; [[Balboa, Canal Zone]], from 16<U+2013>20 November; and [[La Guaira, Venezuela]], from 22<U+2013>26 November, before returning to Norfolk on 2 December 1946.<ref name="DANFS"/>

''Wisconsin'' spent nearly all of 1947 as a training ship, taking naval reservists on two-week cruises throughout the year. Those voyages commenced at [[Bayonne, New Jersey]], and saw visits conducted at Guant<U+00E1>namo Bay, Cuba, and the Panama Canal Zone. While underway at sea, the ship would perform various drills and exercises before the cruise would end where it had started, at Bayonne. During June and July 1947, ''Wisconsin'' took [[United States Naval Academy]] midshipmen on cruises to northern European waters.<ref name="DANFS"/>

In January 1948, ''Wisconsin'' reported to the Atlantic Reserve Fleet at Norfolk for inactivation. Placed out of commission, in reserve on 1 July, ''Wisconsin'' was assigned to the Norfolk group of the Atlantic Reserve Fleet.<ref name="DANFS"/>

==The Korean War (1950<U+2013>1952)==
[[Image:USS Wisconsin (BB-64) in formation 1952.jpg|thumb|{{USS|Buck|DD-761|2}}, ''Wisconsin'' and {{USS|Saint Paul|CA-73|2}} steam in close formation during operations off the Korean coast, 1952]]

Her sojourn in "mothballs", however, was comparatively brief, due to the [[North Korea]]n [[Korean War|invasion of]] [[South Korea]] in late June 1950. ''Wisconsin'' was recommissioned on 3 March 1951 with Captain Thomas Burrowes in command.<ref name="DANFS"/> After shakedown training, the revitalized battleship conducted two midshipmen training cruises, taking the officers-to-be to [[Edinburgh, Scotland]]; [[Lisbon, Portugal]]; [[City of Halifax|Halifax]], [[Nova Scotia]]; [[New York City]]; and [[Guant<U+00E1>namo Bay]], Cuba, before she returned to Norfolk. While leaving New York ''Wisconsin'' was accidentally grounded on mud flats in New York Harbor, but was freed on 23 August 1951 with no damage to the ship.<ref name="Accident">{{cite web | title = USS Wisconsin (BB 64) | url = http://www.navysite.de/bb/bb64.htm |publisher=Unofficial US Navy Site |accessdate=26 November 2006}}</ref>

''Wisconsin'' departed Norfolk on 25 October, bound for the Pacific. She transited the [[Panama Canal]] on 29 October and reached [[Yokosuka, Japan]], on 21 November. There, she relieved {{USS|New Jersey|BB-62|2}} as [[flagship]] for Vice Admiral H. M. Martin, Commander, [[United States Seventh Fleet|7th Fleet]].<ref name="DANFS"/>

On 26 November, with Vice Admiral Martin and Rear Admiral F.P. Denebrink, Commander, Service Force, Pacific, embarked, ''Wisconsin'' departed Yokosuka for Korean waters to support the fast carrier operations of TF 77. She left the company of the carrier force on 2 December and, screened by the destroyer {{USS|Wiltsie|DD-716|2}}, provided gunfire support for the [[Republic of Korea]] (ROK) Corps in the [[Kasong]]-[[Kosong]] area. After disembarking Admiral Denebrink on 3 December at [[Gangneung|Kangnung]], the battleship resumed station on the Korean "bombline", providing gunfire support for the American 1st Marine Division. ''Wisconsin''{{'}}s shelling accounted for a tank, two gun emplacements, and a building.<ref name="DANFS"/> She continued her gunfire support task for the 1st Marine Division and 1st ROK Corps through 6 December, accounting for enemy bunkers, artillery positions, and troop concentrations.<ref name="DANFS"/> On one occasion during that time, the battleship received a request for call-fire support and provided three star-shells for the 1st ROK Corps, illuminating an enemy attack that was consequently repulsed with considerable enemy casualties.<ref name="DANFS"/>

After being relieved on the gunline by the [[heavy cruiser]] {{USS|Saint Paul|CA-73|2}} on 6 December, ''Wisconsin'' briefly retired from gunfire support duties. She resumed them, however, in the Kasong-Kosong area on 11 December screened by the destroyer {{USS|Twining|DD-540|2}}. The following day, 12 December, saw the embarkation in ''Wisconsin'' of Rear Admiral H. R. Thurber, Commander, Battleship Division 2 (BatDiv 2). The admiral came on board via [[helicopter]], incident to his inspection trip in the Far East.<ref name="DANFS"/>

''Wisconsin'' continued her naval gunfire support duties on the "bombline," shelling enemy bunkers, command posts, artillery positions, and trench systems through 14 December. She departed the "bombline" on that day to render special gunfire support duties in the [[Kojo]]{{dn|date=August 2012}} area blasting coastal targets in support of [[United Nations]] (UN) troops ashore. That same day, ''Wisconsin'' returned to the Kasong-Kosong area. On 15 December, she disembarked Admiral Thurber by helicopter. The next day, ''Wisconsin'' departed Korean waters, heading for [[U.S. Fleet Activities Sasebo|Sasebo]] to rearm.<ref name="DANFS"/>

Returning to the combat zone on 17 December, ''Wisconsin'' embarked United States Senator [[Homer Ferguson]] of [[Michigan]] on 18 December. That day, the battleship supported the 11th ROK invasion with night illumination fire that enabled the ROK troops to repulse a North Korean assault with heavy enemy casualties.<ref name="DANFS"/><ref name="USS Wisconsin"/> Departing the "bombline" on 19 December, the battleship transferred her distinguished passenger, Senator Ferguson, by helicopter to the carrier {{USS|Valley Forge|CV-45|2}}.<ref name="DANFS"/>

On 20 December, ''Wisconsin'' participated in a coordinated air-surface bombardment of [[Wonsan]] to neutralize pre-selected targets in the Wonson area. The ship shifted its bombardment station to the western end of Wonsan harbor, hitting boats and small craft in the inner swept channel with her {{convert|5|in|mm|abbr=on}} guns during the afternoon. Such activities helped to forestall any attempts to assault the friendly-held islands in the Wonsan area. ''Wisconsin'' then made an anti-boat sweep to the north, firing her {{convert|5|in|mm|abbr=on}} batteries on suspected boat concentrations. She then provided gunfire support to UN troops operating at the "bombline" until 22 December, when she rejoined the carrier task force.<ref name="DANFS"/>

On 28 December, Cardinal [[Francis Spellman]], on a Korean tour over the Christmas holidays, visited the ship, coming on board by helicopter to celebrate Mass for the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] members of the crew. He left the ship by helicopter off [[Pohang]]. Three days later, on the last day of the year, ''Wisconsin'' put into Yokosuka.<ref name="DANFS"/>

''Wisconsin'' departed that Japanese port on 8 January 1952 and headed for Korean waters once more. She reached [[Pusan]] the following day and entertained the [[President of South Korea]], [[Syngman Rhee]], and his wife, on 10 January. President and Mrs. Rhee received full military honors as they came on board, and he reciprocated by awarding Vice Admiral Martin the ROK Order of the Military Merit.<ref name="DANFS"/><ref name="USS Wisconsin"/>

''Wisconsin'' returned to the "bombline" on 11 January, and over the ensuing days delivered heavy gunfire support for the 1st Marine Division and the 1st ROK Corps. As before, her primary targets were command posts, shelters, bunkers, troop concentrations and mortar positions. As before, she stood ready to deliver call-fire support as needed. One such occasion occurred; on 14 January when she shelled enemy troops in the open at the request of the ROK 1st Corps.<ref name="DANFS"/>

Rearming at Sasebo and once more joining TF 77 off the coast of Korea soon thereafter, ''Wisconsin'' resumed support at the "bombline" on 23 January. Three days later, she shifted once more to the Kojo region, to participate in a coordinated air and gun strike. That same day, the battleship returned to the "bombline" and shelled the command post and communications center for the 15th North Korean Division during call-fire missions for the 1st Marine Division.<ref name="DANFS"/><ref name="USS Wisconsin"/>

Returning to Wonsan at the end of January, ''Wisconsin'' bombarded enemy guns at [[Hodo Pando]] before she was rearmed at Sasebo. The battleship rejoined TF 77 on 2 February, and the next day blasted railway buildings and marshaling yards at Hodo Pando and Kojo before rejoining TF 77. After replenishment at Yokosuka a few days later, she returned to the Kosong area and resumed gunfire support. During that time, she destroyed railway bridges and a small shipyard while conducting call-fire missions on enemy command posts, bunkers, and personnel shelters, making numerous cuts on enemy trench lines in the process.<ref name="DANFS"/>

On 26 February, ''Wisconsin'' arrived at Pusan where Vice Admiral Shon, the ROK Chief of Naval Operations; United States Ambassador J.J. Muccio; and Rear Admiral Scott-Montcrief, [[Royal Navy]], Commander, Task Group 95.12 (TG 95.12), visited the battleship. Departing that South Korean port the following day, ''Wisconsin'' reached Yokosuka on 2 March, and a week later she shifted to Sasebo to prepare to return to Korean waters.<ref name="DANFS"/>

''Wisconsin'' arrived off [[Kimchaek|Songjin, Korea]] on 15 March and concentrated her gunfire on enemy railway transport. Early that morning, she destroyed a communist troop [[train]] trapped outside of a destroyed [[tunnel]]. That afternoon, she received the first direct hit in her history, when one of four shells from a communist {{convert|6|in|mm|abbr=on}} gun battery struck the shield of a starboard 40&nbsp;mm mount; Although little material damage resulted, three men were injured.<ref name="DANFS"/><ref name="USS Wisconsin"/> ''Wisconsin'' subsequently destroyed that battery with a {{convert|16|in|mm|abbr=on}} salvo before continuing her mission.<ref name="DANFS"/><ref name="USS Wisconsin"/> After lending a hand to support once more the 1st Marine Division with her heavy rifles, the battleship returned to Japan on 19 March.<ref name="DANFS"/>

Relieved as flagship of the 7th Fleet on 1 April by sister ship {{USS|Iowa|BB-61|2}}, ''Wisconsin'' departed Yokosuka, bound for the United States. ''En route'' home, she touched briefly at [[Guam]], where she took part in the successful test of the Navy's largest floating dry-dock on 4<U+2013>5 April, marking the first time that an [[Iowa class battleship|''Iowa''-class battleship]] had ever utilized that type of facility. She continued her homeward-bound voyage, via Pearl Harbor, and arrived at [[Long Beach, California]] on 19 April; she then sailed for Norfolk.<ref name="DANFS"/>

===Post Korean War (1952<U+2013>1981)===
[[Image:USS Wisconsin (BB-64) off Norfolk during 1950s.jpg|thumb|''Wisconsin'' off Norfolk during the 1950s.]]

On 9 June, ''Wisconsin'' resumed her role as a training ship, taking midshipmen to [[Greenock, Scotland]]; [[Brest, France]]; and [[Guant<U+00E1>namo Bay]], [[Cuba]], before returning to Norfolk. She departed Hampton Roads on 25 August and participated in the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization|NATO]] exercise [[Operation Mainbrace]], which was held out of Greenock, Scotland. After her return to Norfolk, ''Wisconsin'' underwent an overhaul in the naval shipyard there. ''Wisconsin'' remained in the Atlantic fleet throughout 1952 and into 1953, training midshipmen and conducting exercises. After a month of routine maintenance ''Wisconsin'' departed Norfolk on 9 September 1953, bound for the Far East.<ref name="DANFS"/>

Sailing via the [[Panama Canal]] to Japan, ''Wisconsin'' relieved {{USS|New Jersey|BB-62|2}} as 7th Fleet flagship on 12 October. During the months that followed, ''Wisconsin'' visited the Japanese ports of [[Kobe]], [[Sasebo, Nagasaki|Sasebo Navy Yard]], [[Yokosuka]], [[Otaru]], and [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]]. She spent [[Christmas]] at [[Hong Kong]] and was ultimately relieved of flagship duties on 1 April 1954 and returned to the United States soon thereafter, reaching Norfolk, via Long Beach and the Panama Canal, on 4 May.<ref name="DANFS"/>

Entering the Norfolk Naval Shipyard on 11 June, ''Wisconsin'' underwent a brief overhaul and commenced a midshipman training cruise on 12 July. After revisiting Greenock, Brest, and Guant<U+00E1>namo Bay, the ship returned to the Norfolk Naval Shipyard for repairs. Shortly thereafter, ''Wisconsin'' participated in Atlantic Fleet exercises as flagship for Commander, Second Fleet. Departing Norfolk in January 1955, ''Wisconsin'' took part in Operation Springboard, during which time she visited Port-au-Prince, Haiti. Then, upon returning to Norfolk, the battleship conducted another midshipman's cruise that summer, visiting Edinburgh; [[Copenhagen, Denmark]]; and Guant<U+00E1>namo Bay before returning to the United States.<ref name="DANFS"/>

Upon completion of a major overhaul at the [[New York Naval Shipyard]], ''Wisconsin'' headed south for refresher training in the [[Caribbean Sea]], later taking part in another Springboard exercise. During that cruise, she again visited Port-au-Prince and added [[Tampico, Mexico]], and [[Cartagena, Colombia]], to her list of ports of call. She returned to Norfolk on the last day of March 1955 for local operations.<ref name="DANFS"/> On 19 October, while operating in the [[East River]] in New York Harbor, ''Wisconsin'' was accidentally grounded. However, the ship was freed in about an hour without any serious damage.<ref name="Accident"/>

Throughout April and into May, ''Wisconsin'' operated locally off the Virginia capes. On 6 May, the battleship collided with the destroyer {{USS|Eaton|DDE-510|2}} in a heavy fog; ''Wisconsin'' put into Norfolk with extensive damage to her [[Bow (ship)|bow]], and one week later entered dry dock at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard.<ref name="Accident"/> A novel expedient sped her repairs and enabled the ship to carry out her scheduled midshipman training cruise that summer. A 120&nbsp;ton, 68&nbsp;foot (21&nbsp;m) section of the bow of the uncompleted ''Iowa''-class battleship {{USS|Kentucky|BB-66|2}} was transported by barge, in one section, from [[Northrop Grumman Newport News|Newport News Shipbuilding]] and Drydock Corporation of [[Newport News, Virginia]], across [[Hampton Roads]] to the [[Norfolk Naval Shipyard]].<ref name="DANFS"/> Working around the clock, ''Wisconsin''{{'}}s ship<U+2019>s force and shipyard personnel completed the operation which grafted the new bow on the old battleship in 16 days. On 28 June 1956, the ship was ready for sea.<ref name="USS Wisconsin"/><ref name="Accident"/>

[[Image:USSKentuckyBow.jpg|thumb|The bow of ''Kentucky'', transported in one section, by barge, to repair ''Wisconsin''.]]

''Wisconsin'' resumed her midshipman training on 9 July 1956. That autumn, ''Wisconsin'' participated in Atlantic Fleet exercises off the coast of the Carolinas, returning to port on 8 November 1956. Entering the Norfolk Naval Shipyard a week later, the battleship underwent major repairs that were not finished until 2 January 1957.<ref name="DANFS"/>

After local operations off the Virginia capes on 3<U+2013>4 January 1957 and from 9<U+2013>11 January, ''Wisconsin'' departed Norfolk on 16 January, reporting to Commander, Fleet Training Group, at Guant<U+00E1>namo Bay. ''Wisconsin'' served as Admiral [[Henry Crommelin]]'s flagship during the ensuing shore bombardment practices and other exercises held off the isle of [[Culebra, Puerto Rico]], from 2<U+2013>4 February. Sailing for Norfolk upon completion of the training period, the battleship arrived on 7 February and resumed local operations off Norfolk. On 27 March, ''Wisconsin'' sailed for the [[Mediterranean Sea]], reaching [[Gibraltar]] on 6 April, she pushed on that day to rendezvous with TF 60 in the [[Aegean Sea]] before reporting to [[Turkey]] for the NATO Exercise Red Pivot.<ref name="DANFS"/>

Departing Xeros Bay on 14 April, she arrived at [[Naples]] four days later, ''Wisconsin'' conducted exercises in the eastern Mediterranean. In the course of those operational training evolutions, she rescued a pilot and crewman who survived the crash of a plane from the carrier {{USS|Forrestal|CVA-59|2}}.<ref name="USS Wisconsin"/> ''Wisconsin'' reached [[Valencia, Spain]], on 10 May and, three days later, entertained prominent civilian and military officials of the city.<ref name="DANFS"/>

Departing Valencia on 17 April, ''Wisconsin'' reached Norfolk on 27 May. On that day, Rear Admiral L.S. Parks relieved Rear Admiral Crommelin as Commander, BatDiv 2. Departing Norfolk on 19 June, the battleship, over the ensuing weeks, conducted a midshipman training cruise through the Panama Canal to South American waters, and reached Valparaiso on 3 July. Eight days later, the battleship headed back to the Panama Canal and the Atlantic.<ref name="DANFS"/>

After exercises at Guant<U+00E1>namo Bay and off Culebra, ''Wisconsin'' reached Norfolk on 5 August and conducted local operations that lasted into September. She then participated in [[Operation Strikeback|NATO exercises]] which took her across the North Atlantic to the [[British Isles]].<ref name="DANFS"/>

''Wisconsin''{{'}}s days as an active fleet unit were numbered, and she prepared to make her last cruise. On 4 November, she departed Norfolk with a large group of prominent guests on board. Reaching New York City on 6 November, the battleship disembarked her guests and, on 8 November, headed for Bayonne, New Jersey, to commence a pre-inactivation overhaul. She was placed out of commission at Bayonne on 8 March 1958, and joined the [[United States Navy reserve fleets|United States Navy reserve fleet]] (better known as the "Mothball Fleet") there, leaving the [[United States Navy]] without an active battleship for the first time since 1895.<ref name="DANFS"/> Subsequently taken to the [[Philadelphia Naval Shipyard]], ''Wisconsin'' remained there with her sister ship ''Iowa'' into the 1980s.<ref name="DANFS"/> While berthed in the Philadelphia Naval Yard, ''Wisconsin'' fell victim to an electrical fire, which damaged the ship and left her as the ''Iowa''-class battleship in the worst material condition prior to her 1980s reactivation.<ref>{{Cite news | last = | first = | author-link = | publication-date = April 1987 | date = | year =1987 | title =Back on the battle line | periodical =All Hands | series = | publication-place =Arlington, VA | place = | publisher = | volume = | issue =841 | pages =28<U+2013>29 | url = | issn = | doi =  | postscript = <!--None-->}}</ref>

[[Image:USS Wisconsin (BB-64) preps.JPG|thumb|''Wisconsin'' prepares to fire her 16 inch (406 mm) guns sometime after her 1987-88 modernization.]]

As part of [[President of the United States|President]] [[Ronald Reagan]]'s [[Secretary of the Navy|Navy Secretary]] [[John F. Lehman]]'s effort to create a "[[600-ship Navy]]" ''Wisconsin'' was reactivated 1 August 1986 and moved under tow to the [[Avondale Shipyard]] in [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]], to commence pre-re-commissioning workups. The battleship was then towed from the Avondale Shipyard and arrived at [[Ingalls Shipbuilding]] in [[Pascagoula, Mississippi]] on 2 January 1987 to receive weapons system upgrades for her modernization.<ref name="DANFS"/><ref name="USS Wisconsin"/> During the modernization, ''Wisconsin'' had all of her remaining [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|20 mm]] and [[Bofors 40 mm|40 mm]] anti-aircraft guns removed, due to their ineffectiveness against modern day [[Fighter aircraft|jet fighters]] and enemy anti-ship missiles; additionally, the two {{convert|5|in|mm|abbr=on}} gun mounts located at mid-ship and in the [[aft]] on the [[Port (nautical)|port]] and [[starboard]] side of the battleship were removed.<ref name="FAS Iowa">{{cite web | title = BB-61 IOWA-class (Specifications)|url = http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ship/bb-61.htm |publisher=[[Federation of American Scientists]] |accessdate=26 November 2006}}</ref>

Over the next several months, the ship was upgraded with the most advanced weaponry available; among the new weapons systems installed were four MK 141 quad cell launchers for 16 [[Harpoon missile|AGM-84 Harpoon]] anti-ship missiles, eight [[Armored Box Launcher|Armored Box Launcher (ABL)]] mounts for 32 [[BGM-109 Tomahawk]] [[missile]]s, and a quartet of the United States Navy's [[Phalanx CIWS|Phalanx]] [[Close-in weapon system|Close In Weapon System (CIWS)]] [[gatling gun]]s for defense against enemy [[anti-ship missile]]s and enemy aircraft.<ref name="FAS Iowa"/><ref name="The Battleships II">{{cite book | last =Johnston, Ian & McAuley, Rob | title =The Battleships | publisher =Channel 4 Books (an imprint of Pan Macmillian, LTD) | year =2002 | location =London | page =183 | url = http://www.panmacmillan.com/ | isbn =0-7522-6188-6}}</ref><ref name="The Navy">{{cite book | last =Holland | first =W.

Blesch, USN. Assigned to the United States Atlantic fleet, she was subsequently homeported at Naval Station Norfolk, Virginia, where she became the centerpiece of her own surface action group (SAG), also referred to as a [[battleship battle group]] (BBBG).

''Wisconsin'' spent the first part of 1989 conducting training exercises in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and off the coast of [[Puerto Rico]] before returning to the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard for a post recommissioning shakedown that lasted the rest of the year. In mid-1990 the battleship participated in a fleet exercise.<ref name="USS Wisconsin"/>

==Gulf War (January/February 1991)==
[[Image:USS Wisconsin (BB-64) launching Tomahawk.jpg|thumb|left|''Wisconsin'' launches a BGM-109 Tomahawk missile against a military target in Iraq during Operation Desert Storm.]]

On 2 August 1990, [[Iraq]] invaded [[Kuwait]]. In the middle of the month, [[President of the United States|President]] [[George H. W. Bush]], in keeping with the [[Carter Doctrine]], sent the first of several hundred thousand troops, along with a strong force of naval support to [[Saudi Arabia]] and the Persian Gulf area to support a multi-national force in a standoff with Iraqi dictator [[Saddam Hussein]]. On 7 August, ''Wisconsin'' and her battle group were ordered to deploy in defense of Kuwait for [[Operation Desert Shield]], and they arrived in the Persian Gulf on 23 August.<ref name="USS Wisconsin"/> On 15 January 1991, [[Operation Desert Storm]] commenced operations, and ''Wisconsin'' found herself serving alongside her younger sister ''Missouri'', just as she had done in Korea forty years previously. Both ''Wisconsin'' and ''Missouri'' launched [[Tomahawk Missile]] attacks against Iraq; they were among the first ships to fire cruise missiles during the 1991 Gulf War. ''Wisconsin'' served as the Tomahawk Land Attack Missile (TLAM) strike commander for the Persian Gulf, directing the sequence of launches that marked the opening of Operation Desert Storm and firing a total of 24 of her own TLAMs during the first two days of the campaign.<ref name="Desert Storm">{{cite web|title = V: "Thunder And Lightning"- The War With Iraq (Subsection:The War At Sea) |work= The United States Navy in "Desert Shield" / "Desert Storm"| url = http://www.history.navy.mil/wars/dstorm/ds5.htm |publisher= [[United States Navy]] |accessdate=26 November 2006}}</ref> ''Wisconsin'' also assumed the responsibility of the local anti-surface warfare coordinator for the Northern Persian Gulf Surface Action Group.<ref name="USS Wisconsin"/>

''Wisconsin'', escorted by {{USS|Nicholas|FFG-47|2}}, relieved ''Missouri'' on 6 February, then answered her first combat call for gunfire support since March 1952. The most recently recommissioned battleship sent 11 shells across {{convert|19|mi|km|abbr=on}} of space to destroy an Iraqi [[artillery]] battery in southern Kuwait during a mission called in by [[USMC]] [[OV-10]] aircraft. Using an [[RQ-2 Pioneer|Unmanned Aerial Vehicle]] ([[Unmanned aerial vehicle|UAV]]) as a spotter in combat for the first time, ''Wisconsin'' pounded an Iraqi communications compound on 7 February. Her main guns lobbed 24 shells on Iraqi artillery sites, missile facilities, and electronic warfare sites along the coast. That evening she targeted naval sites with her {{convert|16|in|mm|abbr=on}} guns, firing 50 rounds which severely damaged or sunk 15 Iraqi boats, and destroyed several piers at the Khawr al-Mufattah [[marina]].<ref name="USS Wisconsin"/> In response to calls for fire support from US and coalition forces, ''Wisconsin''{{'}}s turrets boomed again on 9 February, blasting bunkers and artillery sites, and shelling Iraqi troop positions near [[Khafji]] after the Iraqis were ousted from the city by Saudi and [[Qatar]]i armor.<ref name="USS Wisconsin"/> On 21 February, one of ''Wisconsin''{{'}}s UAVs observed several trucks resupplying an Iraqi command post; in response, ''Wisconsin'' trained her {{convert|16|in|mm|abbr=on}} guns on the complex, leveling or heavily damaging 10 of the buildings.<ref name="USS Wisconsin"/> ''Wisconsin'' and ''Missouri'' alternated positions on the gun line, using their {{convert|16|in|mm|abbr=on}} guns to destroy enemy targets and soften defenses along the Kuwait coastline for a possible [[Amphibious warfare|amphibious assault]].<ref name="USS Wisconsin"/><ref name="Desert Storm"/>

[[Image:Pioneer RPV on USS Wisconsin (BB-64).jpg|thumb|left|A technician moves a [[RQ-2 Pioneer|Pioneer RPV]] across the fantail of ''Wisconsin''.]]

On the night of 23 February, ''Missouri'' and ''Wisconsin'' turned their big guns on Kuwait's [[Faylaka Island]] to support the US-led coalition ground offensive to free Kuwait from the Iraqi occupation forces. The two ships were to conduct a [[feint|diversionary assault]] aimed at convincing the Iraqi forces arrayed along the shores of Faylaka Island that Coalition forces were preparing to launch an amphibious invasion.<ref name="Desert Storm"/> As part of this attack, ''Missouri'' and ''Wisconsin'' were directed to shell known Iraqi defensive positions on the island. Shortly after ''Missouri'' completed her shelling of Faylaka Island, ''Wisconsin'', while still over the horizon (and thus out of visual range of the Iraqi forces) launched her RQ-2 Pioneer Unmanned Aerial Vehicle to spot for her {{convert|16|in|mm|abbr=on}} guns. As ''Wisconsin''{{'}}s drone approached Faylaka Island, the pilot of the drone was instructed to fly the vehicle low over Iraqi positions so that the soldiers would know that they were once again being targeted by a battleship.<ref name="Drone"/> Iraqi troops on the ground heard the Pioneer<U+2019>s distinctive buzzing sound, and having witnessed the effects of ''Missouri''{{'}}s artillery strike on their trenchline the Iraqi troops decided to signal their willingness to [[Surrender (military)|surrender]] by waving makeshift [[white flag]]s, an action dutifully noted aboard ''Wisconsin''. Amused at this sudden development, the men assigned to the drone<U+2019>s aircrew called ''Wisconsin''{{'}}s commanding officer, Captain [[David S. Bill III]], and asked, "Sir, they want to surrender, what should I do with them?"<ref name="Drone"/> This surrender to ''Wisconsin''<U+2019>s Pioneer has since become one of the most remembered moments of the Gulf War; the incident was also the first-ever surrender of enemy troops to an unmanned aircraft controlled by a ship.<ref>[[Federation of American Scientists]].

Both ''Wisconsin'' and ''Missouri'' passed the million-pound mark of ordnance delivered on Iraqi targets by the time President George H. W. Bush ended hostilities on 28 February. With one last salvo from her big guns, ''Wisconsin'' fired the last naval gunfire support mission of the war.<ref name="Desert Storm"/> ''Wisconsin'' remained in the Persian Gulf after the cease-fire took effect, and returned home on 28 March 1991.

With the [[History of the Soviet Union (1985-1991)|collapse of the Soviet Union]] in the early 1990s and the absence of a perceived threat to the United States came drastic cuts in the defense budget. The high cost of maintaining and operating battleships as part of the United States Navy's active fleet became uneconomical; as a result, ''Wisconsin'' was decommissioned on 30&nbsp;September 1991, and was stricken from the [[Naval Vessel Register]] (NVR) on 12&nbsp;January 1995. On 15&nbsp;October 1996, she was moved to the [[Norfolk Naval Shipyard]], and on 12&nbsp;February 1998, she was restored to the Naval Vessel Register. On 7&nbsp;December 2000, the battleship was towed from Portsmouth, Virginia and berthed adjacent to [[Nauticus, The National Maritime Center]] in Norfolk. On 16&nbsp;April 2001 the battleship's weather decks were opened to the public by the [[Hampton Roads Naval Museum]], a U.S. Navy museum charged with ''Wisconsin''<U+2019>s interpretation and public visitation.

On 14 December 2009 the US Navy officially transferred ''Wisconsin'' to the city of Norfolk, ending the requirement for the ship to be preserved for possible recall to active duty. The US Navy had paid the city of Norfolk $2.8&nbsp;million between 2000 and 2009 to maintain the ship.<ref>''[[Military Times]]'', "[http://www.navytimes.com/news/2009/12/navy_wisconsin_transfer_121409w/ Navy transfers battleship to Norfolk]", 14 December 2009.</ref> A formal ceremony transferring the ship to the city of Norfolk took place on 16&nbsp;April 2010.<ref>Wilson, Patrick, "Norfolk Takes Helm Of Battleship Wisconsin", ''[[Norfolk Virginian-Pilot]]'', 17&nbsp;April 2010.</ref> ''Wisconsin'' was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on 28&nbsp;March 2012.

On 11 August 2012, [[Republican Party (United States)|GOP]] presidential candidate [[Mitt Romney]] announced his running mate, [[Paul Ryan]], from the dock where the ''Wisconsin'' is moored.<ref>{{cite news  |first=Lynn |last=Sweet |date=10 August 2012  |title=Romney and Ryan in Manassas: "We are going to win" |url= http://www.suntimes.com/news/metro/14405812-418/romney-to-name-running-mate-saturday-nbc-news-its-paul-ryan.html |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]  |accessdate=12 August 2012 }}</ref>

==Awards==
''Wisconsin'' earned five [[battle stars]] for her [[World War II]] service, and one for the [[Korean War]]. The ship also received the [[Combat Action Ribbon]] and [[Navy Unit Commendation]] for actions in the Korean War and Operation Desert Storm in 1991. She also received over a dozen more awards for World War II, the Korean War and Operations [[Operation Desert Shield|Desert Shield]]/[[Desert Storm]].<ref name="USS Wisconsin Awards">USS Wisconsin Association.
