'''''Homework''''' is the debut album of French [[electronic music]] duo [[Daft Punk]], first released on January 20, 1997. The album is considered a blend of [[house music|house]], [[techno]], [[acid (electronic music)|acid]] and [[funk]].<ref name="RFI Musique" /><ref name="Interview at Mixmag 1997" /> It is noted for inciting interest in [[French house|French touch]] music with several artists following the style.<ref name="FrenchConn">James, Martin. ''French Connections: From Discotheque to Discovery''. London, United Kingdom: Sanctuary Publishing Ltd., 2003. pg 292. (ISBN 1-8607-4449-4)</ref> ''Homework'' features the hit singles "[[Around the World (Daft Punk song)|Around the World]]" and "[[Da Funk]]".

==Recording history==
In 1993 [[Thomas Bangalter]] and [[Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo]] presented a [[demo (music)|demo]] of [[electronic music]] to Stuart Macmillan of [[Slam (band)|Slam]] at a rave in [[Disneyland Resort Paris|EuroDisney]].<ref name="Interview at Mixmag 1997">Matthew Collin, [http://www.techno.de/mixmag/97.08/DaftPunk.a.html "Do You Think You Can Hide From Stardom?"] (August 1997) ''[[Mixmag]]''. Retrieved on March 6, 2007.</ref> The contents of the cassette eventually saw release on the single "[[The New Wave]]", which was released in April 11, 1994 on Slam's [[Soma Quality Recordings]] label.<ref name="NewWaveDiscogs">{{Discogs release|name=The New Wave|id=7982}}. Retrieved on April 7, 2007.</ref> The record also contained the final mix of the track "The New Wave" entitled "Alive".

"[[Da Funk]]" and "Rollin' & Scratchin'" were released as a single under the Soma label in 1995. The tracks were then utilized by [[The Chemical Brothers]] in [[DJ mix|DJ sets]] at The Heavenly Social in [[London]]. During the same year, Tom Rowlands and Ed Simons requested that the duo remix their single "[[Life Is Sweet (song)|Life Is Sweet]]" and open for The Chemical Brothers' tour in the United Kingdom.<ref name="DaftDJTimes">[http://www.djtimes.com/original/djmag/may01/daft.htm Daft Punk (2001)] djtimes.com. Retrieved on May 5, 2007.</ref> The ensuing popularity of Daft Punk's singles led to their signing with [[Virgin Records]] in September 1996.<ref name="MusiqueVol.1">[http://web.archive.org/web/20060525135526/http://www.daft-musique.com/ Musique Vol. 1 Site] [[Web archiving|archived]] from May 25, 2006.</ref> Their departure from Soma was noted by Richard Brown of the [[Glasgow]]-based label. "We were obviously sad to lose them to Virgin but they had the chance to go big, which they wanted, and it's not very often that a band has that chance after two singles. We're happy for them."<ref name="Interview at Mixmag 1997" />

Although Virgin held exclusive distribution rights over Daft Punk<U+2019>s material, the duo remain the owners of their [[master recording]]s through the Daft Trax label.<ref name="RFI Musique" /> Bangalter expressed that "To be free, we had to be in control. To be in control, we had to finance what we were doing ourselves. The main idea was to be free."<ref name="DaftPulse">Alan Di Perna, "We Are The Robots" ''Pulse!'', April 2001, pp. 65-69.</ref> Daft Punk discussed their method with [[Spike Jonze]], director of the "Da Funk" music video. He noted that "They were doing everything based on how they wanted to do it. As opposed to, 'oh we got signed to this record company, we gotta use their plan.' They wanted to make sure they never had to do anything that would make them feel bummed on making music."<ref name="Jonze Book 2003">''[[Director's Label#Volume 1: The Work Of Director Spike Jonze|The Work of Director Spike Jonze]]'' companion book (2003).</ref> In regards to the duo's creative control and freedom, Bangalter said:

{{cquote| We've got much more control than money. You can't get everything. We live in a society where money is what people want, so they can't get the control. We chose. Control is freedom. People say we're control freaks, but control is controlling your destiny without controlling other people. We're not trying to manipulate other people, just controlling what we do ourselves. Controlling what we do is being free. People should stop thinking that an artist that controls what he does is a bad thing. A lot of artists today are just victims, not having control, and they're not free. And that's pathetic. If you start being dependent on money, then money has to reach a point to fit your expenses.<ref>http://music.yahoo.com/read/interview/12053561</ref>}}

Daft Punk worked to record other tracks, including "[[Revolution 909]]" and "[[Around the World (Daft Punk song)|Around the World]]". The album was mixed and recorded in their own studio, Daft House in [[Paris]], France. It was [[audio mastering|mastered]] by Nilesh Patel at the London studio The Exchange.<ref name="LinerNotes"/>

Virgin re-released "Da Funk" with the B-side "[[Musique Vol. 1 1993-2005|Musique]]" in 1996, before the debut of ''Homework''. Bangalter later stated that the B-side "was never intended to be on the album, and in fact, 'Da Funk' as a single has sold more units than ''Homework'', so more people own it anyways than they would if it had been on the album. It is basically used to make the single a double-feature."<ref name="DaftDMA"/>

==Structure==
Daft Punk deliberately ordered the album's tracks with a two-disc [[Gramophone record|vinyl LP]] in mind. As stated by [[Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo]], "We had many tracks and we had to put them on four sides... there was no intended theme because all the tracks were recorded before we arranged the sequence of the album. The idea was to make the songs better [more listenable] by arranging them the way we did; to make it more even as an album."<ref name="DaftDMA">Jennifer Warner, [http://dancemusic.about.com/cs/interviews/a/IntDaftPunkDave_3.htm "Interview with Daft Punk"]. ''[[DMA (magazine)|DMA]]'', archived at [[About.com]]. Retrieved on March 30, 2007.</ref>

"Daftendirekt" is an excerpt of a live performance recorded at a Fuse Party in [[Ghent|Gent]].<ref name="LinerNotes">Daft Punk ''Homework'' liner notes (1997).</ref> It served as the introduction to Daft Punk's show and is likewise used to begin the album.<ref name="DaftDMA" /> The following track, "WDPK 83.7 FM" is considered a tribute to [[FM broadcasting|FM]] radio displayed in the United States.<ref name="DaftPulse" /> The broadcast compression is one of the major influences in Daft Punk's music. As stated by de Homem-Christo, "Some people like the really good sound of a guitar, and we really like the sound of compression in general."<ref name="mixonlineinterview">Bryan Reesman, [http://mixonline.com/mag/audio_daft_punk/ Daft Punk interview] mixonline.com. Retrieved on April 9, 2007.</ref> The repeated vocal phrase used in "[[Musique Vol. 1 1993-2005|Musique]]" also appears in "WDPK".

The opening skit in "[[Revolution 909]]" is said to be a reflection on the [[Government of France|French government]] and its stance on the rave scene. When asked on the motivations of the stance, [[Thomas Bangalter]] presumed, "They pretend it's drugs, but I don't think it's the only thing. There's drugs everywhere, but they probably wouldn't have a problem if the same thing was going on at a rock concert, because that's what they understand."<ref name="DaftDMA" /> "Revolution 909" is immediately followed by "[[Da Funk]]", which is considered to carry elements of [[funk]] and [[acid (electronic music)|acid]].<ref name="Interview at Mixmag 1997" /> In Daft Punk's audio commentary for ''[[Director's Label#Volume 1: The Work Of Director Spike Jonze|The Work of Director Spike Jonze]]'', the duo stated that the "Da Funk" theme involved the introduction of a simple, unusual element that becomes acceptable and moving over time.

Bangalter felt that "Ph<U+0153>nix" is "an important track, but not any more important than any of the other tracks."<ref name="DaftDMA" /> Daft Punk agreed that their concept for the piece was to create [[gospel music|gospel]]-like potency in a [[house music]] track.<ref name="DaftDMA" /> In contrast, "Fresh" is stated to be breezy and light. In the audio commentary provided in ''[[D.A.F.T. - A Story About Dogs, Androids, Firemen and Tomatoes|D.A.F.T.]]'', the duo consider its structure to be comical.

"[[Around the World (Daft Punk song)|Around the World]]" is believed to carry influences of [[Gershon Kingsley]]'s hit "[[Popcorn (instrumental)|Popcorn]]".<ref name="Interview at Mixmag 1997" /> [[Michel Gondry]] likewise compared the track's [[bassline]] to that of "Good Times" by [[Chic (band)|Chic]].<ref name="Michel Book 2003">''[[Director's Label#Volume 3: The Work Of Director Michel Gondry|The Work of Director Michel Gondry]]'' companion book (2003).</ref> The track "Teachers" is an homage to the pioneers in the [[Detroit techno]] and [[Chicago house]] scenes and acknowledges (among others) future collaborators [[Romanthony]], [[DJ Sneak]] and [[Todd Edwards]]. The song "Oh Yeah" features guests DJ Deelat and DJ Crabbe, otherwise known as David Girier-Dufourier and Pascal Esposito.<ref name="LinerNotes" /> As one half of Jess & Crabbe, the latter created a remix released on the album ''[[Daft Club]]'' of the song "[[Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger]]".

"Indo Silver Club" is based on a sample of "Hot Shot" by [[Karen Young (American singer)|Karen Young]].<ref name="LinerNotes" /> Prior to its inclusion on ''Homework'', "Indo Silver Club" was released as a single on [[Soma Quality Recordings|Soma Recordings]] as two parts.<ref name="DiscogsIndo">{{Discogs release|name=Indo Silver Club|id=7984}}. Retrieved on April 9, 2007.</ref> The single lacked an artist credit in the packaging<ref name="DiscogsIndo" /> and was initially thought to have been created by the nonexistent producers Indo Silver Club.<ref name="Punks">[http://www.montrealmirror.com/ARCHIVES/1997/040397/cover.html Personality punks] montrealmirror.com. Retrieved on August 3, 2007.</ref> The final mix of "[[The New Wave]]" ("Alive") was included on the album as the fifteenth track. Finally, "Funk Ad" is a reversed portion of "Da Funk".

==Reception==
Daft Punk felt that the majority of pressings should be in vinyl, so only 50,000 albums were initially printed on [[Compact Disc|CD]]. Upon its release in 1997, overwhelming sales of ''Homework'' caused distributors to accelerate production and satisfy demand. The album appeared in 35 countries throughout the world and sold over two million copies in a few months from release.<ref name="RFI Musique">[http://www.rfimusique.com/siteen/biographie/biographie_6151.asp RFI Musique - Biography - Daft Punk] rfimusique.com. Retrieved on March 3, 2007.</ref>

''Homework'' featured singles that had significant impact in the [[French house]]<ref name="FrenchConn" /> and global dance music scenes.<ref name="RFI Musique" /> This includes the acclaimed <U+201C>[[Da Funk]]<U+201D> and <U+201C>[[Around the World (Daft Punk song)|Around the World]]<U+201D>, which peaked at #1 on the [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] charts for [[Hot Dance Club Play|Hot Dance Music/Club Play]].<ref>[http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:wxfqxqthldae~T31 ''Homework'' Billboard information] [[Allmusic]]. Retrieved on March 30, 2007.</ref> The album itself peaked #150 on the [[Billboard 200]]. As a result of sales, ''Homework'' was [[RIAA certification|certified Gold]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] as of July 11, 2001.

The album is noted in the book ''[[1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die]]''. In it, critic Alex Rayner states that "''Homework'' served as a bridge between more established club styles and the burgeoning eclecticism of [[big beat]]. And it proved to many club-goers that there was more to dance music than pills and keyboard presets".<ref name="1001albums">''[[1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die]]''.
