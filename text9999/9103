'''Greta Lovisa Gustafsson''' (18 September 1905 <U+2013> 15 April 1990), better known as '''Greta Garbo''', was a noted [[Swedish people|Swedish]] actress and recluse. She was a major star in the United States during the [[silent film]] era and the [[Golden Age of Hollywood]]. In 1999, the [[American Film Institute]] ranked Garbo fifth on their list of [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Stars|greatest female stars of all time]], after [[Katharine Hepburn]], [[Bette Davis]], [[Audrey Hepburn]], and [[Ingrid Bergman]].

Garbo launched her career with a major role in the Swedish film ''[[The Saga of Gosta Berling]]''. Her performance caught the attention of [[Louis B. Mayer]], who brought her to [[Hollywood]] in 1925 to work at [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (MGM). She became a star of silent films.

Garbo was one of the few actresses to negotiate the transition to sound{{Whom?|date=March 2011}}. Her first talking film was ''[[Anna Christie (1930 film)|Anna Christie]]'' (1930), for which she was nominated for an [[Academy Award]]. MGM marketers enticed the public with the catchphrase "Garbo talks!" In 1932, her popularity allowed her to dictate the terms of her contract, and she became increasingly choosy about her roles.

She received the [[New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress]] for ''[[Anna Karenina (1935 film)|Anna Karenina]]'' (1935), but she considered her performance as the courtesan [[The Lady of the Camellias|Marguerite Gautier]] in ''[[Camille (1936 film)|Camille]]'' (1936) her best performance; the role gained her a second Academy Award nomination. After working exclusively in dramatic films, Garbo turned to comedy with ''[[Ninotchka]]'' (1939) and ''[[Two-Faced Woman]]'' (1941). For ''Ninotchka'', Garbo was again nominated for an Academy Award; ''Two-Faced Woman'' did well at the box office, but was a critical failure.

After 1941, she retired after appearing in 27 films, and became increasingly reclusive. She has been indelibly linked to one of her lines from the film ''[[Grand Hotel (film)|Grand Hotel]]'': "I want to be alone". She later remarked, "I never said, 'I want to be alone.' I only said, 'I want to be let alone.' There is all the difference."<ref name="NYT-Obit-let-alone" /><ref name="Shapiro2006"/> To the end of her life, Garbo-watching became a sport among the paparazzi and the media, but she remained elusive up until her death in 1990 at the age of 84.

==Biography==
===Childhood and youth (1905<U+2013>1920)===
Garbo was born in [[Stockholm]], Sweden. She was the third and youngest child of Anna Lovisa ([[n<U+00E9>e]] Karlsson) (1872<U+2013>1944) <U+2013> a homemaker and later employee at a jam factory <U+2013> and Karl Alfred Gustafsson (1871<U+2013>1920), an unskilled worker.<ref name="WareBraukman2004p227-228" /><ref name="Sjolander1971p12-13" /> Her siblings were Sven Alfred (1898<U+2013>1967)<ref name="Furhammar1991p129" /> and Alva Maria (1903<U+2013>1926).

Garbo's parents had met in Stockholm, where her father made occasional trips from his home in [[Frinnaryd]]. He moved to Stockholm to become independent. He eventually worked various odd jobs and married Garbo's mother, who had recently relocated from [[H<U+00F6>gsby]].<ref>[http://carina.stridlund.se/hellbomwebb/pcf361e2e.html "Karl Alfred Gustafsson"]. Retrieved December 7, 2010.</ref>{{sfn|Bainbridge|1955b|p=76}}

The family lived at Blekingegatan No. 32 in [[S<U+00F6>dermalm]],<ref name="DAmico1962p901" /> a working-class district regarded as the city's slum, in a small, cold-water tenement apartment.<ref name="PorterPrince2005p382" /> She would later recall:

{{quote|It was eternally gray&nbsp;<U+2014> those long winter's nights. My father would be sitting in a corner, scribbling figures on a newspaper. On the other side of the room my mother is repairing ragged old clothes, sighing. We children would be talking in very low voices, or just sitting silently. We are filled with anxiety, as if there is danger in the air. Such evenings are unforgettable for a sensitive girl. Where we lived, all the houses and apartments looked alike, their ugliness matched by everything surrounding us.<ref name="Lektyr1931" />}}

As a child, Garbo was a shy daydreamer.<ref name="Corporation1974">{{Cite book|author= Liberty Library Corporation |title= Liberty |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=vQYAAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA57 |accessdate= 4 August 2010 |year= 1974 |publisher= Liberty Library Corporation |pages= 27<U+2013>31 & 54<U+2013>57 }}</ref> She hated school<ref name="Biery1928a-hatesc"/><ref>{{Cite journal|journal= Life Magazine |date= 8 |year= 1937 |month= November|title= LIFE |volume= 3 |issue= 19 |pages= 81 |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=kD8EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA81 |accessdate= 4 August 2010 |publisher= Time Inc |issn= 0024-3019 }}</ref> and did not play much,<ref name="Biery1928a-noplay"/> but became interested in theater from an early age<ref name="Biery1928a-sixorseven"/> and dreamed about becoming an actress.<ref name="Biery1928a-sixorseven"/><ref name="Biery1928a-dreaming"/> At the age of 13, Garbo graduated from school,<ref>{{Cite book

===Early career (1920<U+2013>1924)===
Her first job was as a soap-lather girl in a barbershop. One day a young man by the name of Kristian Bergstr<U+00F6>m, son of the founder of the [[PUB (Stockholm)|PUB]] department store, came in for a shave. He eventually offered her a job as a clerk at PUB. She accepted the offer and started working at PUB in July 1920, where she also [[model (person)|modeled]] for newspaper advertisements. She appeared in two short film advertisements,<ref name="Svtplay.se" /><ref name="coop" /> the first for PUB. They were eventually seen by comedy director [[Erik Arthur Petschler]]. He gave her a part in his upcoming film ''Peter the Tramp'' (1922).

From 1922 to 1924, Greta Gustafsson studied at [[Dramatens elevskola|The Royal Dramatic Theatre's Acting School]] in Stockholm. There, director [[Mauritz Stiller]], who also worked as a teacher, trained her in cinematic acting, gave her the [[stage name]] Greta Garbo, and cast her in a major role in the silent film ''[[The Saga of Gosta Berling]]'' in 1924, a dramatization of the famous novel by [[Nobel Prize for Literature|Nobel Prize]] winner [[Selma Lagerl<U+00F6>f]]. She played opposite Swedish film actor [[Lars Hanson]]. She followed this with a part in the 1925 German film ''[[Die freudlose Gasse]]'' (''The Joyless Street'' or ''The Street of Sorrow''), directed by [[G. W. Pabst]] and co-starring [[Asta Nielsen]].

[[Louis B. Mayer]] viewed ''The Saga of Gosta Berling'' during a visit to [[Berlin]]. He was impressed with Stiller's direction, but was more taken with Garbo's acting and screen presence.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} According to Mayer's daughter, [[Irene Mayer Selznick]], with whom he screened the film, he was impressed by the gentleness and expression that emanated from her eyes.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} Mayer brought Garbo and Stiller to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.

===Silent films (1925<U+2013>1929)===
[[Image:Garbo-Torrent-26.jpg|thumb|Garbo with [[Ricardo Cortez]] in ''Torrent'' (1926)]]
Stiller and Garbo arrived in Hollywood in September 1925.<ref name="Pensel1969" /><ref name="Wakeman1987" /> Although she expected to work with Stiller on her first film,<ref name="Wollstein1994" /> within a month, Garbo was cast for ''[[Torrent (1926 film)|The Torrent]]'', displacing her senior by 10 years, [[Aileen Pringle]], in the role of Leonora opposite [[Ricardo Cortez]]<ref name="Katchmer1991" /> under the direction of [[Monta Bell]].<ref name="WalkerMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer1980" /> ''The Torrent'' did well at the box office despite the fact that it was rather coolly received by the trade press,<ref name="Jacobs2008" /> and Garbo received good reviews.<ref name="Variety-Torrent" /><ref name="HallHadaunt1926" />

The success led [[Irving Thalberg]], who at first had pronounced Garbo as "absolutely unusable"<ref name="Billquist1960" /> to cast her in a similar vamp role in another [[Vicente Blasco Ib<U+00E1><U+00F1>ez|Ib<U+00E1><U+00F1>ez]] adaptation, ''[[The Temptress]]'', this time giving her top billing opposite [[Antonio Moreno]].<ref name="Resto2008" /> Her mentor Stiller, who persuaded her to take the part, directed.<ref name="Thomsen1997p129" /> For both Garbo, who did not like the script any more than she had the first one,<ref name="Flamini1994" /> and Stiller, ''The Temptress'' was a harrowing experience; Garbo remembered it as a picture associated with doom: on the fourth day of production, she received a telegram from Stockholm informing her of the death of her sister Alva at the age of 23.{{sfn|Bainbridge|1955|p=92}} MGM did not permit Garbo to return to Sweden for the funeral. Shortly thereafter, Stiller, who spoke little English, had difficulty adapting to the studio system,<ref name="Biery1928c-Stiller-artist" /> and did not get on with Moreno,<ref name="Golden2001" /> was replaced by [[Fred Niblo]]. Reshooting ''The Temptress'' was expensive; even though it became one of the top-grossing films of the 1926<U+2013>27 season, with nearly {{US$|1 million}} in receipts,<ref name="Vieira2009p67" /> it became the only Garbo film of the period to lose money.<ref name="Koszarski1994" /> Garbo herself got very good reviews,<ref name="Brown1965" /><ref name="ConwayMcGregorRicci1968p51" /><ref name="Zierold1969p164" /><ref name="HallMorduant1926" /> and it gave MGM another star.<ref name="Vieira2009p67" />{{sfn|Paris|1995|p=108}}
[[File:Greta Garbo02 crop.jpg|left|thumb|During filming of ''[[Die freudlose Gasse]]'' (1925)]]
The best-received{{Whom?|date=March 2011}} of Garbo's silent movies were ''[[Flesh and the Devil]]'' (1926), ''[[Love (1927 film)|Love]]'' (1927) and ''[[The Mysterious Lady]]'' (1928). She starred in the first two with popular leading man [[John Gilbert (actor)|John Gilbert]].{{sfn|Paris|1995|pp=124<U+2013>125}} <!--- Garbo played the role of Iris Storm in ''The Green Hat'', a role made famous by stage actress [[Katharine Cornell]].<ref>Tad Mosel, "Leading Lady: The World and Theatre of Katharine Cornell," Little, Brown & Co, Boston (1978)</ref>{{Off-topic?|date=July 2010}} What is this?

Despite her enormous success as a silent [[movie star]],<ref name="Crafton1999pg495" /> Garbo feared that her Swedish accent might impair her work in sound, and delayed the shift for as long as possible.<ref name="Crafton1999pg295" /><ref name="Limbacher1968p219" /> MGM, for its part, made a slow changeover to sound.<ref name="Crafton1999pg206" /> Her last silent movie, ''[[The Kiss (1929 film)|The Kiss]]'' (1929), was the last film MGM made without dialogue, although it used a soundtrack with music and sound effects only.

===Queen of MGM (1930<U+2013>1939)===
Garbo is among the actors and actresses who successfully made the transition to [[Sound film|talkies]]; publicized with the slogan "Garbo talks!", her voice was first heard on screen in ''[[Anna Christie (1930 film)|Anna Christie]]'' (1930), a film adaptation of the 1922 play by [[Eugene O'Neill]]. The movie was a huge success{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}. In 1931, she made a German version of the movie. Garbo next appeared as the [[World War I]] spy ''[[Mata Hari (1931 film)|Mata Hari]]'' (1931) opposite screen lover [[Ramon Novarro]]. She was subsequently part of an all-star cast in ''[[Grand Hotel (film)|Grand Hotel]]'' (1932) in which she played a [[Russian people|Russian]] ballerina.
[[Image:Douglas-Ninotchka.jpg|thumb|right|Garbo and [[Melvyn Douglas]] in ''Ninotchka'' (1939)]]

After a [[contract]] dispute with MGM, she eventually signed a new contract with the studio in July 1932, which gave her more control over her parts and her private life. Garbo demonstrated great loyalty to John Gilbert, whose career was fading, and insisted that he appear with her in 1933's ''[[Queen Christina (film)|Queen Christina]]'' (1933), despite the objection of MGM studio head Louis B. Mayer; [[Laurence Olivier]] had originally been chosen for the role. In 1935, [[David O. Selznick]] wanted to cast her as the dying heiress in ''[[Dark Victory]]'', but she insisted on doing [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy's]] ''[[Anna Karenina (1935 film)|Anna Karenina]]'' instead. Although Anna Karenina was arguably one of her most famous roles, Garbo regarded her role as the doomed courtesan in [[George Cukor]]'s ''[[Camille (1936 film)|Camille]]'' (1936), opposite [[Robert Taylor (actor)|Robert Taylor]], as her finest performance.

She then starred opposite [[Melvyn Douglas]] in ''[[Ninotchka]]'' (1939), directed by [[Ernst Lubitsch]]. ''Ninotchka'' attempted to lighten Garbo's somber and melancholy image. The comedy, Garbo's first, was marketed with the tagline "Garbo laughs!", playing off the tagline for ''Anna Christie''.

===Last films (1940<U+2013>1948)===
The follow-up film, [[George Cukor]]'s ''[[Two-Faced Woman]]'' (1941), attempted to capitalize on Garbo's restyled war-time image by casting her in a romantic comedy, in which she played a double role that featured her dancing and tried to portray her as an ordinary girl. The film, Garbo's last, was a critical, although not a commercial, failure, and Garbo referred to the film as "my grave".{{sfn|Bainbridge|1955c|p=129}} She was offered many roles over the years after that, and showed serious interest in about half a dozen<U+2014>but in each case either she eventually turned the role down, or the projects failed.{{sfn|Bainbridge|1955c|p=130}}

In 1948, Garbo signed a contract for $200,000 with producer [[Walter Wanger]], who had produced ''[[Queen Christina (film)|Queen Christina]]'' in 1933, to shoot a picture based on [[Honor<U+00E9> de Balzac|Balzac]]'s ''La Duchesse de Langeais'' which [[Max Oph<U+00FC>ls]] was slated to adapt and direct.<ref name="Reid2006p44" /><ref name="Kellow2004p338" /><ref name="ForrestKoos2002p151-152" /> Garbo made several [[screen test]]s, learned the script and in the summer of 1949 arrived in Rome, where the picture was to be filmed, but financing failed to materialize, and in the end, the project was abandoned.{{sfn|Bainbridge|1955c|p=130}} These screen tests<U+2014>the last time Garbo stepped in front of a movie camera<U+2014>were thought to have been lost for 40 years, before resurfacing in someone's garage.<ref name="Alberge2005" /> Parts of the screen tests were included in the 2005 [[Turner Classic Movies|TCM]] documentary ''Garbo'', and show her still radiant at age 43.<ref name="TCM-GarboDoc" /><ref name="TCM-GarboProfile" />

Italian motion picture director [[Luchino Visconti]] had actively been working on a film adaptation of [[Marcel Proust|Proust]]'s colossal work ''[[In Search of Lost Time|Remembrance of Things Past]]'' since 1969 with a breathtaking prospective cast including [[Silvana Mangano]], [[Alain Delon]], [[Helmut Berger]], [[Charlotte Rampling]], [[Laurence Olivier]] and Garbo in the small part of [[Maria Sophie of Bavaria|Maria Sophia, Queen of Naples]]. Reportedly, Garbo went to Rome and did a color screen test for the role in 1971,{{sfn|Paris|1995|p=460}} and Visconti exclaimed:

<blockquote>
I am very pleased at the idea that this woman, with her severe and authoritarian presence, should figure in the decadent and rarefied climate of the world described by Proust.<ref name="Time1971-03-01" /><ref name="ParishBowers1974p241" />
</blockquote>

Visconti's dream of making his Proust film came closest to realization in 1971, but with its length of almost four hours, the budget turned out to be astronomical, and the project never came to fruition.<ref name="BeugnetSchmid2004p50ff" /><ref name="Bacon1998p208ff" />

==Personal life==
Except for the very early days of her career, Garbo was reclusive; she seldom signed autographs,<ref name="NYT-GarboBack-refused" />{{sfn|Bainbridge|1955a|p=12}} rarely attended social functions,{{sfn|Bainbridge|1955a|p=12}} answered no fan mail,{{sfn|Bainbridge|1955a|p=12}}<ref name="NYT-GarboBack-letters" /><ref name="NYT-Obit-privacy" /> and gave few interviews.{{sfn|Bainbridge|1955a|p=12}}<ref name="NYT-GarboBack-smokinglounge" /><ref name="NYT-Obit-avoid-press" /> Her refusal to give interviews gave rise to the press reporter expression "pulling a Garbo" or "going Garbo", referring to any such actions.<ref name="Gever2003p144" /> In her 1928 ''[[Photoplay]]'' interview she said:

<blockquote>
I have always been moody. When I was just a little child, as early as I can remember, I have wanted to be alone. I detest crowds, don<U+2019>t like many people. I used to crawl into a corner and sit and think, think things over.<ref name="Biery1928a-moody" />
</blockquote>

Her last interview was with the entertainment writer [[Paul Callan]] of the British newspaper ''[[Daily Mail]]'' during the [[Cannes Film Festival]].{{When|date=July 2010}} Meeting at the [[Hotel du Cap|Hotel du Cap Eden Roc]], Callan began his line of questioning with, "I wonder..."

In 1931, Garbo befriended the writer and socialite [[Mercedes de Acosta]], introduced to her by the author [[Salka Viertel]]. According to de Acosta, the pair ultimately began a sporadic and volatile romance, punctuated by long periods during which Garbo ignored her and disregarded her many love letters. After about a year, the relationship ended, but they maintained contact. Due to de Acosta's claims in her controversial 1960 autobiography ''Here Lies the Heart'' about her many trysts with Garbo, the pair became permanently estranged.<ref>

During the 1940s, Garbo maintained a discreet liaison with Swedish industrialist John Hjelme-Lundberg, who traveled on at least three occasions to New York to be with her. Hjelme-Lundberg kept an autographed photo of the actress with an inscription in their native Swedish: "''Hjelme, med all min k<U+00E4>rlek, G.''" ("Hjelme, with all my love, G.").

In his 1995 book ''Garbo: a biography'', [[Barry Paris]] discusses Garbo's relationships<U+2014>which were often just close friendships<U+2014>with actor [[George Brent]], conductor Leopold Stokowski, nutritionist [[Gayelord Hauser]], photographer [[Cecil Beaton]], and her manager [[George Schlee]], husband of designer [[Valentina (fashion designer)|Valentina]].{{sfn|Paris|1995}}

I used to go there at seven o<U+2019>clock in the evening, when they would be coming in, and wait until eight-thirty. Watch them come in; listen to them getting ready. The big back door was always open even in the coldest weather. Listen to their voices doing their parts in the productions. Smell the grase paint! There is no smell in the world like the smell of the backyard of a theater. No smell that will mean as much to me <U+2013> ever. Night after night, I sat there dreaming.

</ref>
<ref name="NYT-Obit-avoid-press">

{{Harvnb|NYTimes|1990|p=}}. A declaration often attributed to her was, "I want to be alone." Actually she said, "I want to be let alone."
</ref>
<ref name="NYT-Obit-aloofness">

<ref name="Bainbridge1955-married">
{{Harvnb|Bainbridge|1955c|p=118}}. After she had parried questions about Stokowski she was asked if she ever planned to marry. "If I could find the right person to share my life with<U+2014>perhaps I would," Garbo answered. (Bainbridge quotes from Garbo's surprise interview granted to the press onboard the liner Kungsholm on 7 October 1938 in New York after Garbo had returned from her summer vacation with conductor [[Leopold Stokowski]] in Europe).

<ref name="Bainbridge1955-children">
{{Harvnb|Bainbridge|1955c|p=118}}. About her visits to an infant that had been born on the voyage, she said, "I am always very interested in babies. The birth of a baby is always a miracle." Would she like to have children of her own? Garbo shrugged. "No. The world now seems much too difficult. ... I would not want to raise a son or any children to go to war. ..."

| quote = I want to go on record as saying that Greta Garbo in The Temptress knocked me for a loop. I had seen Miss Garbo once before, in The Torrent. I had been mildly impressed by her visualeffectiveness. In The Temptress, however, this effectiveness proves positively devastating. She may not be the best actress on the screen. I am powerless to formulate an opinion on her dramatic technique. But there is no room for argument as to the efficacy of her allure... [She] qualifies herewith as the official Dream Princess of the Silent Drama Department of Life.

We may also add that she is a magnetic woman and a finished actress. In fact, she leaves nothing to be desired. Such a profile, such grace, such poise, and most of all, such eyelashes. They swish the air at least a half-inch beyond her languid orbs. Miss Garbo is not a conventional beauty, yet she makes all other beauties seem a little obvious.

| quote = Hardly since General Douglas MacArthur's "I shall return" has so momentous a comeback loomed. According to Italian Cinema Director Luchino Visconti, fabled Film Star Greta Garbo, 65, who has been dodging cameras for 30 years, has actually asked to play in his forthcoming movie version of Marcel Proust's seven-volume Remembrance of Things Past. The role that caught her fancy: Maria Sophia, the sixtyish Queen of Naples, who will have only one scene. Nothing has been signed as yet, but Visconti sounded as if Garbo's reappearance was already a fait accompli. Said he: "I am very pleased at the idea that this woman, with her severe and authoritarian presence, should figure in the decadent and rarefied climate of the world described by Proust."
