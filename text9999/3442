'''Simon of Southwell''' (sometimes '''Simon of Sywell''',<ref name=Revolution87>Brundage "Managerial Revolution" ''Magna Carta and the England'' p. 87</ref> or '''Simon of Siwell''')<ref name=Judiciary231>Turner ''English Judiciary'' p. 231</ref> was a medieval English [[canon lawyer]] and [[canon (priest)|canon]] who became treasurer of the [[cathedral chapter]] of [[Lichfield Cathedral]]. He served in the household of [[Hubert Walter]], who was Archbishop of Canterbury from 1193 to 1205. Pope [[Celestine III]] appointed Simon as a [[papal judge-delegate]], and Simon also served Walter in Rome on two legal cases. A number of the [[gloss (annotation)|glosses]] on a late-twelfth-century copy of [[Gratian]]'s ''[[Decretum Gratiani|Decretum]]'' are ascribed to Simon.

==Early career==

Simon was treasurer of the cathedral chapter in 1203.<ref name=RomanLaw53/> He also held a [[prebend]] at Lichfield until 1209.<ref name=Young56/> Previously he had been a lecturer in [[canon law]] at [[University of Bologna|Bologna]], [[University of Paris|Paris]] and at [[Oxford University|Oxford]].<ref name=VCH>Greenslade "House of Secular Canons" ''A History of the County of Stafford: Volume 3''</ref> In Paris, Simon argued a case before [[Peter the Chanter]] that dealt with papal mandates, and his arguments won over Peter to his side of the discussion.<ref name=Lewis59>Lewis "Canonists and Law Clerks" ''Seven Studies'' p. 59</ref>

While at Oxford, Simon, along with [[John of Tynemouth (canon lawyer)|John of Tynemouth]], [[Honorius of Kent]], and possibly [[Nicholas de Aquila]] are the first securely attested lecturers on law known for Oxford.<ref name=Boyle110>Boyle "Beginnings of Legal Studies" ''Viator'' pp. 110<U+2013>112</ref> Simon may also have studied canon law at Bologna.<ref name=RomanLaw53>Turner "Roman Law" ''Judges, Administrators, and the Common Law'' p. 53</ref> 

==Service to Hubert Walter==
Simon served in the household of [[Hubert Walter]], who was [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] from 1193 to 1205. Simon served along with other canon lawyers including John of Tynemouth and Honorius of Kent.<ref name=RomanLaw68>Turner "Roman Law" ''Judges, Administrators, and the Common Law'' p. 68 footnote 150</ref> He had previously been with the household of [[Hugh of Lincoln|Hugh]], [[Bishop of Lincoln]], transferring to Walter's household about 1195.<ref name=Young56/> 

[[Pope Celestine III]] appointed Simon as a [[papal judge-delegate]], and Simon also served Walter in Rome on two legal cases. In 1202, while Walter was on the continent, Simon was named as administrator of the [[diocese of Canterbury]] during the archbishop's absence.<ref name=Young56/>

In 1203, [[Thomas of Marlborough]], who was a monk of [[Evesham Abbey]], pled a case for Evesham before Archbishop Walter, and later, in his chronicle, he noted that Simon, John of Tynemouth, and Honorius, all canon lawyers from the archbishop's household, sided with the abbey. He also described the three men as ''magistri mei in scholis''. Surviving evidence shows that Simon and John frequently found themselves on opposing sides of cases, which suggests a rivalry between the two over their expositions of canon law. Thomas appears to have studied under Simon, John and Honorius at Oxford.<ref name=Young56>Young ''Hubert Walter'' pp. 56<U+2013>57</ref> 

One of the cases that Simon pled for the archbishop was Walter's case against [[Gerald of Wales]], who had been elected to the [[Bishop of St David's|Bishopric of St David's]] in Wales. Walter opposed Gerald's appointment, and Simon, along with John of Tynemouth and another canon lawyer, were sent to Rome to argue Walter's case against Gerald.<ref name=Young96>Young ''Hubert Walter'' p. 96</ref>

==Teachings==

Like John of Tynemouth, a number of the [[gloss (annotation)|gloss]]es on a late-twelfth-century copy of [[Gratian]]'s ''[[Decretum Gratiani|Decretum]]'' are ascribed to Simon.<ref name=Young56/> These take the form of notes from his lectures that were later added to the margins of copies of the ''Decretum''. This combined work is now at [[Gonville and Caius College]] at [[Cambridge University]], catalogued as manuscript (MS) 283/676. Another set of student notes from his lectures, this time entitled ''Quaestiones'', survives as part of [[British Library]] MS Royal E.VII. This work includes lecture notes not only from Simon's classes, but from John and Nicholas' as well.<ref name=Boyle110/>
