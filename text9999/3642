[[Philip K.

The brick is visible under the ivy at the stadium in locations where the signs designate the distance from the wall to [[Baseball field#Home plate|home plate]] measured in feet. The cover art image replaces the distance with the words "All the Way". Through {{by|2006}}, the only signs on the outfield walls had been these signs designating the distance to homeplate. Then, on February 14, 2007, the Cubs announced that they would place advertisements for [[Under Armour]] on the outfield doors in [[Left fielder|left]] and [[Right fielder|right field]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=2766025|title=Cubs sell ad space on doors in Wrigley's outfield fence|accessdate=2008-09-22|date=2007-02-14|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures|work=[[ESPN.com]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/17158075/|title=Not even Wrigley's ivy outfield safe from ads: Cubs sell space to Under Armour; ads on outfield walls for first time ever|accessdate=2008-09-22|date=2007-02-14|publisher=[[NBC Universal]]|work=[[MSNBC]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070214&content_id=1802103&vkey=news_chc&fext=.jsp&c_id=chc|title=Wrigley to feature Under Armour ads: Signs will be first allowed on stadium's outfield doors|accessdate=2008-09-22|date=2007-02-14|publisher=MLB Advanced Media, L.P.|work=Official Site of the Chicago Cubs|author=Muskat, Carrie}}</ref>
