[[Image:Patriarch Moran Mor Ignatius Zakka I.jpg|thumb|120px|right|Patriarch Ignatius Zakka I]]
Following the death of Patriarch [[Ignatius Ya`qub III|Ya`qub III]] on 25 June 1980, Iwas was elected by the [[synod]] of the church to be the 122nd Syriac Patriarch of Antioch. He was enthroned as patriarch on 14 September, the [[feast of the Cross]], by [[Baselios Paulose II]], [[Catholicos of the East]], in St. George's Patriarchal [[Cathedral]] in [[Damascus]].<ref name="light" />  As is traditional for the head of the church, he adopted the name Ignatius at this time. Being the first patriarch to be named Zakka, his name is often written as Ignatius Zakka I Iwas. His full titulary is:

As Patriarch Ignatius Zakka I, he has been involved in [[ecumenism|ecumenical dialogue]] and is a president of the [[World Council of Churches]]. The [[Council of Chalcedon|Chalcedonian schism]] is not seen to have great relevance any more and, from dialogue with the [[Pope|Roman pope]], a reconciling declaration emerged that stated, in part:  

{{cquote|The confusions and schisms that occurred between their Churches in the later centuries, they realize today, in no way affect or touch the substance of their faith, since these arose only because of differences in terminology and culture and in the various formulae adopted by different theological schools to express the same matter. Accordingly, we find today no real basis for the sad divisions and schisms that subsequently arose between us concerning the doctrine of Incarnation. In words and life we confess the true doctrine concerning Christ our Lord, notwithstanding the differences in interpretation of such a doctrine which arose at the time of the Council of Chalcedon.<ref>From the common declaration of Pope John Paul II and HH Mar Ignatius Zakka I Iwas, June 23, 1984</ref>}}

Iwas is a member in different Eastern and Western Academies and has authored a number of books on Christian education, theology, history, and culture in Syriac and the Arabic and English languages.<ref name="light" /> He established a monastic seminary, the Monastery of St. Ephrem The Syrian, at Marret [[Saidnaya]]. Inaugurated on 14 September 1996, this Monastery forms part of a larger project which will include different centers and facilities.<ref name="light" /> During the visit of [[Pope John Paul II]] to Syria in 2001, the Pope paid an historic visit to Iwas in Damascus. The meeting took place on 6 May in Saint George's Patriarchal Cathedral at Bab Touma. The following year, Iwas installed Dionysius Thomas, the president of the Episcopal Synod of Indian Church, as the [[Catholicos of India]] with the title [[Baselios Thomas I]]. Celebrations were held for Iwas's [[Silver Jubilee]] on 14 September 2005.
