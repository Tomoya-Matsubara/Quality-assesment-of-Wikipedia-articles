'''''Our Gang''''', also known as  '''''The Little Rascals''''' or '''''Hal Roach's Rascals,''''' was a long-lived series of [[United States|American]] [[comedy]] [[short film]]s about a troupe of poor neighborhood [[child|children]] and the adventures they had together.  Created by comedy [[film producer|producer]] [[Hal Roach]], ''Our Gang'' was produced at the Roach studio starting in 1922 as a silent short subject series. Roach changed distributors from [[Path<U+00E9>]] to [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (MGM) in 1927, went to sound in 1929, and continued production until 1938, when he sold the series to MGM. MGM continued producing the comedies until 1944. A total of 220 shorts and one feature film, ''[[General Spanky]]'', were eventually produced, featuring over forty-one [[child actor]]s. In the mid-1950s, the 80 Roach-produced shorts with sound were syndicated for [[television]] under the title ''The Little Rascals'', as MGM retained the rights to the ''Our Gang'' trademark.

The series, one of the best-known and most successful in [[film|cinema]] history, is noted for showing children behaving in a relatively natural way. While child actors are often groomed to imitate adult acting styles, steal scenes, or deliver "cute" performances, Hal Roach and original [[film director|director]] [[Robert F. McGowan]] worked to film the unaffected, raw nuances apparent in regular kids. ''Our Gang'' also notably put [[boy]]s, [[girl]]s, [[whites]], and [[Black (people)|black]]s together in a group as equals, something that "broke new ground," according to film historian [[Leonard Maltin]]. Such a thing had never been done before in cinema, but was commonplace after the success of ''Our Gang''.

==About the series==
[[Image:Hearts-are-thumps-ourgang.jpg|left|thumb|Some of the most popular ''Our Gang'' members, in a scene from 1937's ''Hearts are Thumps'': (from left to right) [[George "Spanky" McFarland]], [[Carl "Alfalfa" Switzer]], [[Billie "Buckwheat" Thomas]], and [[Darla Hood]].]]
Unlike many other motion pictures featuring children that are based in [[Fantasy (psychology)|fantasy]], producer/creator Hal Roach rooted ''Our Gang'' in real life: the majority of the kids were poor, and the gang was often put at odds with snobbish rich kids, officious adults and parents, and other such adversaries. The series was notable in that the gang included both [[African-Americans]] and females in leading parts at a time when [[discrimination]] against both groups was commonplace. 

===Directorial approach===
Senior [[film director|director]] [[Robert F. McGowan]] helmed most of the ''Our Gang'' shorts until 1933, assisted by his nephew [[Robert A. McGowan|Anthony Mack]]. He worked hard to develop a style that allowed the kids to be as natural as possible, downplaying the importance of the filmmaking equipment. [[screenplay|Scripts]] were written for the shorts by the Hal Roach comedy writing staff, which included at various times [[Leo McCarey]], [[Frank Capra]], [[Walter Lantz]], and [[Frank Tashlin]], among others. The kids, some of them too young to read, very rarely saw the scripts; instead McGowan would explain the scene to be filmed to each kid right before it was shot, directing the children using a [[megaphone]] and encouraging [[improvisation]]. Of course, when sound came in at the end of the decade, McGowan was forced to modify his approach slightly, but scripts were not adhered to until McGowan left the series. Later ''Our Gang'' directors such as [[Gus Meins]] and [[Gordon Douglas (director)|Gordon Douglas]] used a more streamlined approach to McGowan's methods, in order to meet the demands of the increasingly sophisticated movie industry of the mid to late 1930s. Douglas in particular was forced to streamline his films, as he directed ''Our Gang'' after Roach was forced to halve the running times of the shorts from two reels (20 minutes) to one reel (10 minutes).

===Finding kid talent===
As the children grew too old to be in the series, they were replaced by new kids, usually from the [[Los Angeles]] area. Eventually, ''Our Gang'' talent scouting was done using large-scale national contests, where thousands of kids (often at the behest of their parents) tried out for one open role. [[Norman "Chubby" Chaney]] (who replaced [[Joe Cobb]]), [[Matthew "Stymie" Beard]] (who replaced [[Allen "Farina" Hoskins]]), and [[Billie "Buckwheat" Thomas]] (who replaced Stymie) all won major contests to become members of the gang. Even when there was not a massive talent search going on, the Roach studio was bombarded by requests from parents who were certain their children were perfect for the series. Two of these children included future child stars [[Mickey Rooney]] and [[Shirley Temple]], neither of whom made it into the gang.

===African Americans in ''Our Gang''===
The ''Our Gang'' series is notable for being one of the first times in movie history that African-Americans and [[whites|Caucasians]] were portrayed as equals, though a number of people, including members of the African-American community, do not look favorably upon the characters of the black children today {{ref|DanRatherAllegedRacism}}. The four black child actors who held main-character roles in the series were [[Ernie "Sunshine Sammy" Morrison]], [[Allen "Farina" Hoskins]], [[Matthew "Stymie" Beard]] (whose trademark oversized derby hat was a gift from fellow [[comedian]] [[Stan Laurel]]), and [[Billie "Buckwheat" Thomas]]. Ernie Morrison was, in fact, the first black actor signed to a long-term contract in [[Hollywood]] history {{ref|Sammycontract}}, and was the first major black star in Hollywood history as well {{ref|BogleOnErnieMorrison}}.

The Black children in ''Our Gang'' often epitomized the early [[Hollywood]] black [[ethnic stereotypes in popular culture|stereotype]] of a "[[Negro]]", as well as that of the [[pickaninny]] {{ref|Picaninny}}. These characters provided [[comic relief]] by speaking a mangled form of [[African American Vernacular English|English]], and by frequently being so frightened that either their hair stood on end, or they turned white with fear (a [[special effect]] created with negative film exposure techniques). The Black children's fathers were perpetually mentioned as being in and out of jail, and the children themselves habitually ate [[watermelon]] and [[fried chicken]] in the shorts. [[Comedian]] [[Eddie Murphy]] controversially parodied Buckwheat and the stereotypical aspects of his character in a series of skits for ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.

In their adult years, Ernie Morrison, Matthew Beard, and Billie Thomas became some of ''Our Gang's'' staunchest defenders, maintaining that its integrated cast and innocent story lines were far from [[racist]]. They explained that the white children's characters in the series were similarly [[stereotyped]]: the "freckled kid," the "fat kid," the "pretty blond girl," and the "mischievous toddler." "We were just a group of kids who were having ''fun''," Stymie Beard recalled {{ref|Stymiefun}}. Ernie Morrison stated that "when it came to race, [Hal Roach] was [[color-blind]]" {{ref|Sammycolorblind}}. Other minorities, including [[Asian Americans]] (Sing Joy, Allen Tong, and Edward Zoo Hoo) and [[Italian Americans]] ([[Robert Blake (actor)|Mickey Gubitosi]]), were also depicted in the series, with varying levels of stereotyping.

==History==
[[Image:Julydays.jpeg|left|thumb|(from left to right) [[Jackie Condon]], [[Allen "Farina" Hoskins]], [[Jack Davis (actor)|Jack Davis]], [[Ernie "Sunshine Sammy" Morrison]], and [[Joe Cobb]] in the 1923 short ''July Days''.]]
===Early years===
According to Roach, the idea for ''Our Gang'' came to him in 1921, when he was auditioning a child actress to appear in one of his films. The girl was, in his opinion, overly made up and overly rehearsed, and Roach patiently waited for the audition to be over. After the girl and her mother left the office, Roach looked out of his window to a lumberyard across the street, where he saw a group of children having an argument. The children had all taken sticks from the lumberyard to play with, but the smallest kid had taken the biggest stick, and the others were trying to force him to give it to the biggest kid. After realizing that he had been watching the kids bicker for 15 minutes, Roach thought a short film series about kids just being themselves might be a success {{ref|Roachkids}}.

Under the supervision of [[Charley Chase]], work began on the first two-reel shorts in the new "kids-and-pets" series, which was to be called ''Hal Roach's Rascals'', later that year. Director [[Fred Newmeyer]] helmed the first version of the pilot film, entitled ''Our Gang,'' but Roach scrapped Newmeyer's work and had former [[fireman]] Robert F. McGowan re-shoot the short. Roach tested it at various theaters around Hollywood. The attendees were very receptive, and the press clamored for "lots more of those 'Our Gang' comedies." The colloquial usage of the term ''Our Gang'' led to its becoming the series' second (yet more popular) official title, with the title cards reading "''Our Gang'' Comedies: Hal Roach presents ''His Rascals'' in..." The series was officially called both ''Our Gang'' and ''Hal Roach's Rascals'' until 1932, when ''Our Gang'' became the sole title of the series.

The first cast of ''Our Gang'' kids was recruited primarily from children recommended to Roach by studio employees, including  photographer Gene Kornman's daughter [[Mary Kornman]], their friends' son [[Mickey Daniels]], Roach child actor [[Ernie "Sunshine Sammy" Morrison]], and family friends [[Allen "Farina" Hoskins]], [[Jack Davis (actor)|Jack Davis]], [[Jackie Condon]], and [[Joe Cobb]]. Most of the early shorts were shot outdoors and on location, and also featured a menagerie of comic animal characters, such as Dinah the Mule.

Roach's distributor [[Path<U+00E9>]] released ''One Terrible Day'', the fourth short to be produced for the series, as the first ''Our Gang'' short on [[September 10]], [[1922]]; the pilot ''Our Gang'' was not released until [[November 5]]. The ''Our Gang'' series was a success from the start, with the kids' naturalism, the funny animal actors, and McGowan's direction making a successful combination. The shorts did well at the box office, and by the end of the decade the ''Our Gang'' kids were pictured on numerous product endorsements.

The biggest ''Our Gang'' stars in this period were Sunshine Sammy, around whom the series was structured; Mickey Daniels; Mary Kornman; and little Farina, who eventually became both the most popular member of the 1920s gang{{ref|FarinaMP}} and the most popular African-American child star of the 1920s{{ref|FarinaMP2}}. Mickey and Mary were also very popular, and were often paired together in both ''Our Gang'' and a later teenaged version of the series called ''The Boy Friends'', which Roach produced from 1930 to 1932. Other early ''Our Gang'' kids were [[Eugene "Pineapple" Jackson]], Scooter Lowry, and [[Andy Samuel]].

[[Image:Oldgreyhoss.jpeg|right|thumb|Farina, [[Mary Ann Jackson]], and [[Joe Cobb]] in the 1928 short ''Old Gray Hoss''.]]

===Changing distributors===
After Sammy, Mickey, and Mary left the series in the mid-1920s, the ''Our Gang'' series entered a transitional period. McGowan was often sick and unable to work on the series, leaving nephew [[Robert A. McGowan]] (credited as Anthony Mack) to direct many of the shorts from this period. The Mack-directed shorts are considered to be among the lesser entries in the series.{{ref|AnthonyMacklesser}} New faces included [[Bobby "Wheezer" Hutchins]], [[Harry Spear]], [[Jean Darling]], and [[Mary Ann Jackson]], while stalwart Farina served as the series' anchor.

Also at this time, the ''Our Gang'' kids acquired an [[American Pit Bull Terrier]] with a ring around his eye; originally named "Pansy", the dog soon became known as [[Pete the Pup]], the most famous ''Our Gang'' pet. During this period, Hal Roach ended his distribution arrangement with the Path<U+00E9> company, instead releasing future products through newly formed [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. MGM released its first ''Our Gang'' comedy in September 1927. The move to MGM offered Roach larger budgets, and the chance to have his films packaged with MGM features to the giant [[Loews Theatres]] chain. 

Some of the shorts around this time, particularly ''Spook Spoofing'' (1928, one of only two three-reelers in the ''Our Gang'' canon) contained extended scenes of the gang tormenting and teasing Farina, scenes which helped spur the claims of racism which many other shorts did not warrant. These shorts marked the departure of [[Jackie Condon]], who had been with the group from the beginning of the series.

[[Image:When-the-wind-blows-our-gang.jpg|left|thumb|[[Jackie Cooper]] in the 1930 short ''When the Wind Blows''.]]

===The sound era===
Starting in 1928, ''Our Gang'' comedies were distributed with [[phonograph|phonographic discs]] that contained synchronized music-and-sound-effect tracks for the shorts. In spring 1929, the Roach sound stages were converted for sound recording, and ''Our Gang'' made its "[[Sound film|all-talking]]" debut in April 1929 with the three-reel ''Small Talk.'' It took a year for McGowan and the gang to fully adjust to talking pictures, during which time they lost Joe, Jean, and Harry, and added [[Norman "Chubby" Chaney]], [[Dorothy DeBorba]], [[Matthew "Stymie" Beard]], [[Donald Haines]], and [[Jackie Cooper]]. Jackie proved to be the personality the series had been missing since Mickey left, and his talent was seen to good effect in three 1930/1931 ''Our Gang'' shorts, ''[[Teacher's Pet (1930 short)|Teacher's Pet]]'', ''School's Out'', and ''Love Business'', which explored his crush on the new schoolteacher Miss Crabtree, played by [[June Marlowe]]. Jackie soon won the lead role in [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]]'s feature film ''[[Skippy (1931 movie)|Skippy]]'', and Roach sold his contract to MGM in 1931.

Beginning with 1930's ''When the Wind Blows'', background music scores were added to the soundtracks of most of the ''Our Gang'' films. The music, largely composed by studio musical director [[Marvin Hatley]] and part-time Roach staffer [[Leroy Shield]], became a recognizable trademark of ''Our Gang'', ''[[Laurel and Hardy]]'', and the other Roach series and films. Shield's [[jazz]]-influenced scores, which made their debut with 1930's ''[[Pups is Pups]]'', are particularly associated with ''Our Gang''. ''Teacher's Pet'' marked the first appearance of the now-popular ''Our Gang'' [[theme song]], "Good Old Days", composed by Leroy Shield and featuring a notable [[saxophone]] solo. Shield and Hatley's scores would support ''Our Gang's'' on-screen action regularly through 1934, after which series entries with background scores became less frequent.

===Transition===
Jackie Cooper left ''Our Gang'' in early 1931 at the cusp of another major shift in the lineup, as Farina, Chubby, and Mary Ann all departed a few months afterward. ''Our Gang'' entered another transitional period, similar to that of the mid-1920s. Stymie, Wheezer, and Dorothy carried the series during this period, aided by veteran child actors [[Dickie Moore (actor)|Dickie Moore]] and [[Kendall "Breezy Brisbane" McComas]]. Unlike the mid-20s period, McGowan was able to sustain the quality of the series, with the help of the kids and the Roach writing staff.

New Roach discovery [[George "Spanky" McFarland]] joined the gang in 1931 at the age of three and, excepting a brief hiatus during the summer of 1938, remained an ''Our Gang'' kid for the next eleven years. At first appearing as the tag-along toddler of the group, and later finding an accomplice in [[Scott Beckett]] in 1934, Spanky quickly became ''Our Gang'''s biggest child star; he won parts in a number of outside features, appeared in many of the now-numerous ''Our Gang'' product endorsements and spin-off merchandise items, and popularized the expressions "Okey-dokey!" and "Okey-doke!" {{ref|SpankyOkeyDoke}}

In late 1933, Robert McGowan, worn out from the stress of working on the kids' comedies, left the series and the Roach studio, going over to direct features at Paramount. German-born [[Gus Meins]] assumed McGowan's role starting with ''Hi'-Neighbor!'' in 1934, working with assistant director [[Gordon Douglas (director)|Gordon Douglas]] and alternating directorial duties with Fred Newmeyer.

Wally Albright and Jackie Lynn Taylor joined the gang at this time; as did [[Billie Thomas]], who within a few months of joining would begin playing the character of Stymie's sister "Buckwheat" (even though Thomas was a male). The Buckwheat character became a male in 1935 after Stymie left the series. The same year, [[Carl Switzer]] and his brother Harold joined the gang after impressing Roach with an impromptu performance at the studio commissary, the ''Our Gang'' Cafe, which was open to the public. While Harold would eventually be relegated to the role of a background player, Carl, nicknamed "Alfalfa", became Scotty Beckett's replacement as Spanky's sidekick. [[Darla Hood]] and [[Eugene "Porky" Lee]] also joined the gang in 1935.

===The final Roach years===
''Our Gang'' was hugely successful during the 1920s and the early 1930s. However, by 1934, movie theater owners were increasingly dropping two-reel (twenty minute) comedies like ''Our Gang'' and the ''Laurel and Hardy'' series from their bills, and running [[double feature]] programs instead.  Although the ''Laurel and Hardy'' series was discontinued in mid-1935 (and Laurel and Hardy moved into feature films full-time), Roach's distributor MGM urged him to continue making the ''Our Gang'' shorts as one-reelers (ten-minutes in length instead of twenty). The first one-reel ''Our Gang'' short, ''[[Bored of Education]],'' won the [[Academy Award]] for Best Live-Action Short Film in 1936. ''Bored of Education'' also marked the directorial debut of former assistant director Gordon Douglas.

[[Image:Ogfolliesof38.jpg|left|thumb|Spanky, Darla, and Alfalfa in the "Club Spanky" dream sequence from the 1937 short ''Our Gang Follies of 1938'']]
Also in 1936, the first (and only) full-length feature film starring the ''Our Gang'' kids was released, entitled ''[[General Spanky]].'' Directed by Douglas and Fred Newmeyer, it starred Spanky, Buckwheat, and Alfalfa in a sentimental, Shirley Temple-esque story set during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. The film focused more on its adult leads (Phillip Holmes and [[Rosina Lawrence]]) than the kids, and was a box office disappointment.

[[Tommy Bond]], an off-and-on member of the gang since 1932, returned to the series as the neighborhood bully Butch, beginning with the 1937 short ''Glove Taps''. ''Glove Taps'' also featured the first appearance of [[Darwood "Waldo" Kaye|Darwood Kaye]] as the bookish Waldo. In later shorts, both Butch and Waldo would become Alfalfa's main rivals in his pursuit of Darla's affections.

Roach produced one last two-reel ''Our Gang'' short, the lavish ''Our Gang Follies of 1938'', in 1937 as a [[parody]] of  MGM's ''[[Broadway Melody of 1938]]''.  In ''Follies of 1938'', Alfalfa, who aspires to be an [[opera]] singer, falls asleep and dreams that his old pal Spanky has become the rich owner of a swanky [[Broadway (New York City)|Broadway]] nightclub, where Darla and Buckwheat perform and make "hundreds and thousands of dollars."

Most casual fans of ''Our Gang'' remember the 1936&ndash;1938 shorts the best, especially the "He-Man Woman Haters Club" from ''Hearts are Thumps (1937)'' and ''Mail and Female (1937)'', the Laurel and Hardy-ish interaction between Alfalfa and Spanky, Alfalfa and Darla's on-again-off-again romance, and the comic team of Porky and Buckwheat.

As the profit margins continued to decline due to double features {{ref|Doublefeature}}, Roach could no longer afford to produce the series, and sold the entire ''Our Gang'' unit (including the rights to the name, the ''Our Gang'' film backlog from 1927 to 1938, and the contracts for the actors, writers, and director Douglas) to MGM in May 1938.

[[Image:ogcomics.jpg|right|thumb|The cover to ''Our Gang Comics'' #1. Cartoon versions of (l to r) [[Robert Blake (actor)|Robert Blake]] (aka Mickey Gubitosi), [[Janet Burston]], Spanky, [[Billy "Froggy" Laughlin]], and Buckwheat appeared in the comic series, which also featured animated MGM stars [[Tom and Jerry (MGM)|Tom and Jerry]] and [[Barney Bear]].]]

===The MGM era===
The MGM-produced ''Our Gang'' shorts were not as well-received as the Roach-produced shorts had been, due to both MGM's inexperience with the brand of [[slapstick comedy]] ''Our Gang'' was famous for and MGM's insistence on keeping Alfalfa, Spanky, and Buckwheat in the series until they were in their early teens. After a frustrated Gordon Douglas left MGM to return to Roach after completing only two films, MGM began using ''Our Gang'' as a training ground for future feature directors; [[George Sidney]], [[Edward Cahn]], Herbert Glazer, and [[Cy Endfield]] all worked on ''Our Gang'' before moving on to features. Nearly all of the 52 MGM-produced ''Our Gangs'' were written by Hal Law and former junior director Robert A. McGowan (Anthony Mack). McGowan was credited for these shorts as "Robert McGowan"; as a result, moviegoers have been confused for decades about whether this Robert McGowan and the senior director of the same name back at Roach were two separate people or not.

The ''Our Gang'' films produced by MGM are considered by many ''Our Gang'' historians, and even the ''Our Gang'' kids themselves, to be lesser films than the Roach entries. {{ref|MGMfilms}} The kids' performances are considered to exhibit a "cutesy" style of child acting that was the antithesis of the original gang. {{ref|MGMfilms2}}. Porky was replaced in 1939 by Mickey Gubitosi, later better known by the stage name of [[Robert Blake (actor)|Robert Blake]]. Butch, Waldo, and Alfalfa all left the series in 1940,  and [[Billy "Froggy" Laughlin]] (with his [[Popeye]]-esque trick voice) and [[Janet Burston]] were added to the cast. By the end of 1941, Darla had also departed from the series, and Spanky followed her within a year. Buckwheat remained in the cast until the end of the series as the only holdover from the Roach era.

The series dropped in financial success after 1939 {{ref|MGMfilms3}}, and when six of the thirteen shorts released between 1942 and 1943 sustained losses rather than turning profits {{ref|MGMfilms4}}, MGM discontinued ''Our Gang'', releasing the final short, ''[[Dancing Romeo]]'' on [[April 29]], [[1944]].

Since 1937, ''Our Gang'' had been featured as a licensed [[comic strip]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] [[comic book|comic]] ''[[The Dandy]]'', drawn by [[Dudley D. Watkins]]. Starting in 1942, MGM licensed ''Our Gang'' to [[Dell Comics]] for the publication of ''Our Gang Comics'', featuring the gang, [[Barney Bear]], and [[Tom and Jerry (MGM)|Tom and Jerry]]. The strips in ''The Dandy'' ended three years after the demise of the ''Our Gang'' shorts, in 1947. ''Our Gang Comics'' outlasted the series by five years, finally changing its name to ''Tom and Jerry Comics'' in 1949. In 2006, [[Fantagraphics Books]] 2006 began issuing a series of volumes reprinting the ''Our Gang'' stories, several of which were drawn by ''[[Pogo]]'' creator [[Walt Kelly]].

==Post-history (''The Little Rascals'') ==
===''The Little Rascals'' television package===
When Hal Roach sold ''Our Gang'' to MGM, he had retained the option to buy back the rights to the ''Our Gang'' trademark, provided he did not produce any more kids' comedies in the ''Our Gang'' vein.  In the mid-1940s, he decided that he wanted to create a new film property in the ''Our Gang'' mold, and forfeited his right to buy back the ''Our Gang'' name in order to produce two [[Cinecolor]] featurettes, ''[[Curley (1947 film)|Curley]]'' and ''[[Who Killed Doc Robbin]]''. Neither film was critically or financially successful, and Roach instead turned his plans toward re-releasing the original ''Our Gang'' comedies.

[[Image:Little-rascals-1994-dvd.jpg|left|thumb|The [[DVD]] cover for the 1994 [[The Little Rascals (1994 movie)|feature film version of ''The Little Rascals''.]]]]
In 1949, MGM allowed Roach to buy back the rights to the 1927&ndash;1938 ''Our Gang'' shorts, while retaining the rights to both the ''Our Gang'' films it produced and ''General Spanky''. As per the terms agreed during the sale, Roach was required to remove the [[MGM Lion]] studio logo and all instances of the names or logos "Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer," "Loews Incorporated," and ''Our Gang'' from the reissued film prints. Using a modified version of the series' original name, Roach packaged the 80 sound ''Our Gang'' shorts as ''The Little Rascals'', and had [[Monogram Pictures]] distribute the shorts, first to theaters starting in 1951, and then to [[television]] in 1955.

Under its new name, ''The Little Rascals'' enjoyed renewed popularity on television, and new ''Little Rascals'' comic books, toys, and other licensed merchandise was made available for purchase. Seeing the potential of the property, MGM began distributing their ''Our Gang'' shorts to television in 1956, and as a result, the two separate packages of ''Our Gang'' films competed with each other in [[television syndication|syndication]] for three decades.

The television rights for the original silent [[Path<U+00E9>]] ''Our Gang'' comedies were sold to National Telepix and other distributors, who distributed the films under titles such as ''The Mischief Makers'' and ''Those Loveable Scallawags with Their Gangs''.

===King World's acquisition and edits===
The television rights to ''The Little Rascals'' were sold to  Interstate TV in the late 1950s. In 1964, they were sold again to a then-new distributor named [[King World Entertainment]], and the success of ''The Little Rascals'' paved the way for King World to become one of the biggest television syndicators in the world; distributing, along with the ''Rascals,'' ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'', ''[[Jeopardy]]'', and ''[[Wheel of Fortune]]''. In 1971, because of controversy over their presumably racist content, as well as other content deemed to be in bad taste, King World made significant edits to its ''Little Rascals'' TV prints. Many of the series entries were trimmed by two to four minutes, while several others (among them ''Spanky'', ''Bargain Day'', ''The Pinch Singer'', ''Mush & Milk'', and ''Three Smart Guys'') were cut down to nearly half of their original length.

At the same time, eight ''Little Rascals'' shorts were removed from the King World television package altogether. ''Lazy Days'' (1929), ''Moan & Groan, Inc.'' (1929), the [[Stepin Fetchit]]-guest-starred ''A Tough Winter'' (1930), ''Little Daddy'' (1931),  ''A Lad An' A Lamp'' (1933), ''The Kid From Borneo'' (1933), and ''Little Sinner'' (1935) were all deleted from the syndication package because of perceived racism, while ''Big Ears'' (1931) was deleted for dealing with the subject of [[divorce]]. The early talkie ''Railroadin'' (1929) was never part of the television package, not because of potentially offensive content, but because its sound tracks (recorded on phonographic records) could not be found and were considered lost.

When King World repackaged ''The Little Rascals'' in the early 2000s, the seventy-one films in the King World package were re-edited, restoring many of the edits made in 1971 and the original ''Our Gang'' title cards. These new television prints made their debut on the [[American Movie Classics]] cable network in 2001.

===New ''Little Rascals'' productions===
1979 brought ''The Little Rascals Christmas Special'', an animated [[Christmas|holiday]] special based on the gang and featuring voice work from Matthew "Stymie" Beard and Darla Hood. [[Hanna-Barbera]] brought the animated gang back from 1982 to 1984 in a series of ''[[The Little Rascals (Hanna-Barbera)|Little Rascals]]'' television cartoons for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] Saturday Mornings. Many producers, including ''Our Gang'' alumnus [[Jackie Cooper]], made pilots for new ''Our Gang'' TV shows, but none of them ever went into production.

In 1994, [[Amblin Entertainment]] and [[Universal Pictures]] released ''[[The Little Rascals (1994 movie)|The Little Rascals]]'', a feature film based upon the series and featuring interpretations of classic ''Our Gang'' shorts, including ''Hearts are Thumps'', ''Rushin' Ballet'', and ''Hi'-Neighbor!'' The film, directed by [[Penelope Spheeris]], starred [[Travis Tedford]] as Spanky, [[Bug Hall]] as Alfalfa, and [[Ross Bagley]] as Buckwheat; and featured cameos by [[the Olsen twins]], [[Whoopi Goldberg]], [[Mel Brooks]], [[Reba McEntire]], [[Donald Trump]], and [[Raven-Symon<U+00E9>]]. ''The Little Rascals'' was a moderate success for Universal, bringing in $51,764,950 at the [[box office]] {{ref|IMDBBoxOfficeTakings}}

==Legacy and influence==
The characters in this series became well-known cultural icons, and could often be identified solely by their first names. The characters of Alfalfa, Spanky, Buckwheat, Darla, and Froggy were especially well-known; though like many child actors they were subsequently [[typecasting (acting)|typecast]] and had trouble outgrowing their ''Our Gang'' images.

The kids' work in the series went largely unrewarded in later years, although Spanky received a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] posthumously in 1994. Neither he nor any of the other ''Our Gang'' kids ever got any [[residual (entertainment industry)|residuals]] or [[royalties]] from [[rerun]]s of the shorts or licensed products with their likenesses. The only remittances they received were their weekly salaries during their time in the gang, which ranged from $40 a week for newcomers to $300 or more a week for stars like Farina, Spanky, and Alfalfa {{ref|Kidssalary}}.

One notable exception is [[Jackie Cooper]], who was later nominated for an [[Academy Award|Oscar]] and had a full career as an adult actor; among other roles his best known character is probably [[Perry White]] in the ''[[Superman]]'' movies starring [[Christopher Reeve]]. [[Robert Blake]] also went on to success as an adult in cinema (''[[In Cold Blood (film)|In Cold Blood]]'') and more notably in television (''[[Baretta]]''). In 2002, Blake was arrested on suspicion of murdering his wife, Bonnie Lee Bakely. He was acquitted of his charges on [[March 16]], [[2005]].

The 1930 ''Our Gang'' short ''[[Pups is Pups]]'' was deemed "culturally significant" by the United States [[Library of Congress]], and selected for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]] in 2004.

===Imitators and frauds===
Due to the popularity of ''Our Gang'', a number of imitation kid [[comedy]] [[short film]] series were created by competing studios. Among the most notable of these are ''The Kiddie Troupers'', featuring future comedian [[Eddie Bracken]], ''Baby Burlesks'', featuring [[Shirley Temple]], the ''[[Buster Brown]]'' comedies (from which ''Our Gang'' received [[Pete the Pup]] and [[Gus Meins]]), and ''Our Gang's'' most successful competitor, the ''[[Toonerville Trolley]]''-based ''Mickey McGuire'' series starring [[Mickey Rooney]].

In later years, a large number of adults falsely claimed to have been members of the popular group. A long list of people, including persons famous in other capacities such as [[Nanette Fabray]] and Eddie Bracken, have all claimed to be or have been publicly called former Our Gang kids {{ref|OGimposters}}. Bracken's official biography was once altered to state that he appeared in ''Our Gang'' instead of ''The Kiddie Troupers'', although he himself had no knowledge of the change. There are many other persons who have falsely claimed to have been ''Our Gang'' kids such as Spanky, Alfalfa, Froggy, and often other characters that never existed.

Among the most notable ''Our Gang'' impostors is Jack Bothwell, who claimed to have portrayed a nonexistent character named "Freckles", and went so far as to appear on the game show ''[[To Tell The Truth]]'' in 1957 perpetuating this [[fraud]]. Another is Bill English, a [[grocery store]] employee who appeared on the [[October 5]] [[1990]], episode of the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] investigative [[television]] [[newsmagazine]] ''[[20/20]]'' claiming to have been Buckwheat. Following the broadcast, Spanky McFarland informed the media of the truth, and in December, William Thomas, Jr., the son of the actual actor who played Buckwheat, filed a [[lawsuit]] against ABC for negligence.

===Persons and entities named after ''Our Gang''===
A number of other groups, companies, and entities have been inspired by or named after ''Our Gang''. For example, the [[folk-rock]] group [[Spanky and Our Gang]] was named in honor of the troupe, but had no other connection with it. In addition, there are a number of (unauthorized) ''Little Rascals'' and ''Our Gang'' [[restaurant]]s and [[day care|day care center]]s in various locations throughout the [[United States]].

==Home video releases and rights to the films==
===16 mm, VHS, and DVD releases===
{{details|Our Gang filmography}}
From the 1960s to the 1980s, copies of all eighty Hal Roach ''Little Rascals'' talkies, and a handful of the silents, were available on [[16 mm film]] through [[Blackhawk Films]]. The only edits made to the films were the replacements of the original ''Our Gang'' title cards with ''Little Rascals'' titles. Like the other ''Little Rascals'' distributors, Blackhawk was required to use custom title cards in place of the originals, and the conversion of ''Railroadin''', whose soundtrack could not be found, into a silent. In the early 1980s, Blackhawk made two-thirds of the ''Little Rascals'' shorts available by catalog on [[VHS]] [[home video]]. Blackhawk Films was acquired in 1983 by [[Republic Pictures]], who repackaged about thirty ''Little Rascals'' shorts in various VHS compilations for sale in retail stores in 1984. 

Cabin Fever Entertainment acquired the ''Little Rascals'' home video rights from Republic in 1993, and between 1994 and 1995 issued all eighty Roach talkies in a twenty-two volume ''Little Rascals'' VHS tape set. Each volume, hosted by film historian [[Leonard Maltin]], featured four digitally restored and uncut shorts, complete with their original ''Our Gang'' title cards. In 1998, Cabin Fever shut down and sold the ''Little Rascals'' home video rights to [[Hallmark Entertainment]], who reisssued the first ten volumes of the Cabin Fever VHS set, and released two ''Little Rascals'' DVD compilations. A third DVD, entitled ''Little Rascals Collectors' Series Volume III'', was issued on [[November 15]], [[2005]], and includes ten sound shorts.

Meanwhile, MGM had released several non-comprehensive VHS tapes of its shorts, as well as the feature ''General Spanky''.  There are many other unofficial ''Our Gang'' and ''Little Rascals'' home video collections available from several other distributors, comprised of shorts (both silent and sound) which have fallen into the [[public domain]].

===Status of ownership===
Currently, the rights to the ''Our Gang''/''Little Rascals'' shorts are scattered.  [[Hallmark Entertainment]] holds the theatrical and home video rights to the Roach-produced ''Our Gang'' shorts, which it acquired after absorbing [[Hal Roach Studios]], Roach's estate, and Cabin Fever Entertainment in the late 1990s. King World continues to hold the rights to the ''Little Rascals'' trademark and the ''Little Rascals'' television package; it offers both original black-and-white and [[film colorization|colorized]] prints for syndication. King World's ''Little Rascals'' package was recently featured as exclusive programming (in the [[United States]]) for the [[American Movie Classics]] network from August 2001 to December 2003, with [[Frankie Muniz]] as the host.

The MGM-produced ''Our Gang'' shorts, ''[[General Spanky]]'', and the rights to the ''Our Gang'' name have been owned by [[Turner Entertainment]] (today a subsidiary of [[Time Warner]]) since 1986. Turner made a deal with King World in the early 1990s to jointly market the ''Little Rascals'' and ''Our Gang'' films and properties, instead of competing with one another. The MGM ''Our Gangs'' now appear regularly on the [[AmericanLife TV Network]], and periodically on the [[Turner Classic Movies]] cable network.

The widely-circulated rumor that entertainer [[Bill Cosby]] bought up the rights to ''Our Gang'' to keep the racial stereotypes off of television is false.  Cosby has never owned any rights to the series at any time {{ref|Snopes}}.

His name was Ernest Morrison. He was known as Sunshine Sammy and he worked with Harold Lloyd. He worked in the early "Our Gang" series. He was very well-known within the black community in Los Angeles. People knew him and admired him. But they were the early ones. The other thing that was also interesting was that, in the very early days, there were a number who ended up working as servants for major white stars."
