'''Royce Middlebrook "Ross" Youngs''' (April 10, 1897&nbsp;<U+2013> October 22, 1927) was a [[professional baseball]] player. Nicknamed "Pep", he played ten seasons in [[Major League Baseball]] for the [[San Francisco Giants|New York Giants]] from 1917 through 1926, playing [[right fielder|right field]] almost exclusively. Youngs was a part of the Giants teams that won four consecutive [[List of National League pennant winners|National League pennants]] and the [[1921 World Series|1921]] and [[1922 World Series]].

From [[Shiner, Texas]], Youngs excelled at baseball and [[American football]] at the [[West Texas Military Institute]]. After beginning his professional career in [[minor league baseball]], the Giants signed him in 1916. Youngs had a lifetime .322 [[batting average]] with the Giants and batted over .300 nine times in his career, including eight consecutive seasons. His career was cut short by illness, however, as he died at the age of 30 of [[Bright's Disease]].

Known for his defense and hitting, he was elected to the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Baseball Hall of Fame]] in 1972 by the [[Veterans Committee]]. His election was not without controversy, however, as the Veterans Committee consisted of his former teammates, and charges of cronyism were levied against the Veterans Committee.

==Early life and minor leagues==
Youngs was born in [[Shiner, Texas]], the second of three children, all sons.<ref name=seattle/> His father was a railroad worker,<ref name=shiner/> but suffered disability and moved his family to [[San Antonio]] where he worked as a rancher. Youngs' mother ran a small hotel in San Antonio and Youngs had a paper route.<ref name=seattle/>

Youngs was educated at [[West Texas Military Institute]].<ref name=seattle/> He received offers for scholarships to play [[college football]] but passed on these, as he preferred baseball.<ref name=seattle/> He made his professional baseball debut for the [[Austin Senators]] of the [[Texas League]] in 1914. Appearing in 17 games, he hit just .145 for the class-B Senators and, in 1915, found himself down in the Class-D leagues, playing for Brenham of the [[Middle Texas League]] and the [[Waxahachie Athletics]] of the [[Central Texas League]]; both leagues disbanded during the season.<ref name=seattle/> In 1916, playing in the [[infield]] for the [[Sherman Lions]] of the Class-D [[Western Association]], he hit .362 as a [[switch-hitter]], drawing the attention of the [[San Francisco Giants|New York Giants]], who purchased his contract in August for $2,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|2000|1916}}}} in current dollar terms).<ref name=seattle/>

==New York Giants==
Youngs reported to [[spring training]] in [[Marlin, Texas]] with the Giants in 1917. They initially assigned him to the [[Rochester Hustlers]], a team in the [[International League]] with which the Giants had a working relationship. Giants manager [[John McGraw]] told [[Mickey Doolan]], the manager of the Hustlers, "I'm giving you one of the greatest players I've ever seen. Play him in the outfield. If anything happens to him, I'm holding you responsible."<ref name=seattle/> In 140 games with Rochester, Youngs hit .356, earning himself a late-season promotion to the big league club.<ref name=seattle/> McGraw gave Youngs the nickname "Pep" due to his hustle<ref name=pep>{{cite news|url=http://haysfreepress.com/2011/08/03/before-lou-gehrig-there-was-a-texan-called-%E2%80%98pep%E2%80%99/|title=Before Lou Gehrig, there was a Texan called <U+2018>Pep<U+2019>|date=August 3, 2011|first=Bartee|last=Haile|newspaper=Hays Free Press|accessdate=July 3, 2012}}<</ref> and soon began to groom Youngs to become his successor as Giants' manager.<ref name=seattle/> 

Youngs made his major league debut on September 25 and played in seven of the last nine games of the season for the eventual [[National League]] (NL) [[pennant (sports)|pennant]]-winners: six in [[center fielder|center field]] and one in right. In those seven games he went 9-for-26 (.346) with two doubles and three triples.<ref name=seattle/> In 1918 regular Giants right fielder [[Dave Robertson]] left the team to manage a local military ballclub,<ref>{{cite book|last=Stewart|first=Peter C.|title=Early Professional Baseball in Hampton Roads: A History, 1884-1928|year=2010|publisher=McFarland|page=185}}</ref> and Youngs was given the full-time job out of spring training.

==Illness and death==
Youngs's career was abruptly cut short in 1926 when he was diagnosed with the [[kidney]] disorder that, at the time, was called [[Bright's disease]].

==Legacy==
Over his abbreviated ten-year career, Youngs posted 812 runs, 42 home runs, 592 [[runs batted in]] (RBI), 153 [[stolen base]]s, a .322 career batting average, and .399 career [[on base percentage]].

Youngs scored 100 or more [[run (baseball statistics)|runs]] three times and posted a career high 102 RBI in 1921 and 10 [[home run]]s in 1924. During his tenure with the team, the Giants went to the [[World Series]] four consecutive years (1921<U+2013>1924) and won twice (1921, 1922).
