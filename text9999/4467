 }}</ref> Ostrum was 12 years old when selected by talent agents for ''Willy Wonka''.  Though he enjoyed the experience of shooting the film, he opted not to sign a three-film contract when it was over.  After eschewing a career in film and theater, Ostrum became reluctant to speak about his one starring role.  In 1990, he began an annual tradition of speaking to schoolchildren about the film, and he became a subject of interest again when 2005's ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'' was released in theaters.

Ostrum became interested in horses when he returned from shooting ''Willy Wonka'', and was particularly influenced by the veterinarian that tended to them.  Receiving his [[veterinary physician|Doctorate of Veterinary Medicine]] from [[Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine]] in 1984, Ostrum now practices and lives in [[Lowville (village), New York|Lowville, New York]],<ref name="20050718msnbc" /> with his wife Loretta (n<U+00E9>e Lepkowski), and two children: his son Leif and daughter Helenka.<ref name="20050717npr" />

==Acting career==
Ostrum was in the sixth grade and performing at the [[Cleveland Play House]] [[children's theatre]], when he was noticed by [[talent agent]]s who were searching nationwide for the actor to portray [[Charlie Bucket]] in ''[[Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory]]''. The agents took [[instant camera|Polaroid photo]]s of Ostrum and recorded him reading from [[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory|the original novel]] then returned to [[New York]]. Two months later Ostrum was called to New York for a [[screen test]] where he sang "[[My Country, 'Tis of Thee]]",<ref name="IWIN52" /> and a month after that he was contacted and given ten days to prepare to leave for filming.<ref name="avma20001101">{{cite journal

In 2000, Ostrum recalled that shooting ''Willy Wonka'' in [[Munich]] was "sort of like being an exchange student for five months".  Fond memories of his five months in West Germany included watching the construction of [[Olympiapark, Munich]], for the [[1972 Summer Olympics]], and working with [[Gene Wilder]] and [[Jack Albertson]].<ref name="20050717npr" /><ref name="avma20001101" />  Though in his audition he had been assured that his singing would probably be cut and [[dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]], it was Ostrum's own singing voice that made it to the screen&mdash;albeit significantly cut.<ref name="20050717npr">{{cite news

===Lasting effect===
In his [[senior (education)|senior year]], Ostrum was involved in film class and, at the interest of one of his instructors, looked back into theatre and acting.

In 1990, he was invited to speak to students at [[Lowville Academy]] by teacher Carol Reed, and has since spoken to students there once a year&mdash;on the last day of school, as a special treat&mdash;about his experience with ''Willy Wonka'' as well as his work in veterinary medicine.<ref name="20050718msnbc" />  About the film, the students chiefly ask about the special effects, and Ostrum describes to them "what happened to Veruca, how did Violet blow up like a blueberry, how did Charlie fly with Grandpa Joe, all those types of questions."<ref name="20050717npr" />  Ostrum has been called "the most famous man in Lowville", where the local [[video rental shop]] has twice worn out its [[VHS]] copy of ''Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory''.<ref name="20050718msnbc" />  

In October 2000, Ostrum and some of his co-stars from the film were scheduled to record an audio commentary for a special edition [[DVD]].<ref name="avma20001101" />  

In the run-up to the release of [[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)|''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'']] in 2005, Ostrum garnered a spate of attention that included seeing the film in New York City with [[NPR]] as well as being included in [[VH1]]'s list of "100 Greatest Kid Stars" (placing 78th).<ref name="20050718msnbc" />  On the new film, Ostrum quoted fellow ''Wonka'' actor [[Julie Dawn Cole]], saying that "It's sort of like going back to a house that you once lived in and it's been redecorated."  Ultimately, the media attention was so pervasive that Ostrum stopped answering his phone, and requested "please, no more interviews."<ref name="20050717npr" />

In January 2009, Ostrum teamed up with [[Dunkin' Donuts]] to hand out free rides on the [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority]] (MBTA) at [[South Station]] in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]]; Ostrum's participation connected the MBTA's [[CharlieCard]]s he was handing out with his portrayal of Charlie Bucket in ''Willy Wonka''.  The promotion also gave out one "golden ticket", worth unlimited rides on MBTA and unlimited Dunkin' Donuts coffee for 2009.<ref name="DDyoutube">{{cite video

My father was a lawyer, and I really didn't have a clue what he did all day.  But I knew exactly what the veterinarian did.

Soon after Ostrum returned home from filming ''Willy Wonka'', his family acquired a horse; while the teenaged Ostrum was interested in the horse, it was the animal's veterinarian that left a lasting impression on him.  Taking a hiatus from school between [[high school]] and [[college]], Ostrum [[groom (profession)|groomed]] horses and worked at the [[Delaware Equine Center]] in [[Pennsylvania]].  Ostrum contemplated a return to [[Hollywood]], and even visited [[California]] for a week to "test the waters" there.  He ultimately decided to pursue a degree in [[veterinary medicine]] instead, feeling that he would forever berate himself if he didn't.  In 1984, Peter Ostrum received his [[veterinary physician|Doctorate of Veterinary Medicine]] from [[Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine]].<ref name="avma20001101" />
