The '''Sydney Roosters''' are a team in the [[National Rugby League]] (NRL), the premier [[rugby league]] football competition in [[Australia]]. From 1908 to 1994, they were known as Easts (or more formally, Eastern Suburbs) and from 1995 - 1999, the Sydney City Roosters.

Based in [[Bondi Junction]] in the eastern suburbs of Sydney, the Roosters rugby league club has existed since 1908, one of the foundation members in the then [[New South Wales Rugby League]] (NSWRL) competition, predecessor of the [[Australian Rugby League]] (ARL) and the current NRL competition. The Roosters merged their junior competition with that of Souths Juniors, but despite this, over recent years have developed championship junior teams.  The Roosters are the only founding member of the New South Wales Rugby League to have an uninterrupted representation from 1908 through to the current competition, with 2006 being the clubs 99th consecutive season.

== Club history == 
{{details|Sydney Roosters history}}
The Eastern Suburbs Rugby League Football Club was formed on [[24 January]] [[1908]] after it was decided that they would enter to play in the newly-formed [[New South Wales Rugby League]]. Eastern Suburbs, as they were more commonly known as, were also donned the unofficial nickname the "Tricolours" due to the use of the club's red, white and blue playing strip. The club kicked off their existence with a win in their opening match played at [[Wentworth Oval]] on [[20 April]] [[1908]], downing [[Newtown Jets|Newtown]] 32-16.

[[Image:Dally Messenger in action.jpg|40px|frame|left|Dally Messenger in action.]]
Eastern Suburbs remained competitive throughout it's early years, winning a treble of [[New South Wales Rugby League premiership|premierships]] between 1911 and 1913, much thanks to the talented line up consisting of league greats such as [[Dally Messenger]], [[Jersey Flegg|Harry "Jersey" Flegg]] and [[Sandy Pearce]].

The years spanning from 1926 to 1942 were arguably the most successful period for the club in its history, missing the finals just three times whilst being able to win the premiership four times and the minor premiership seven times.<ref>[http://www.stats.rleague.com/rl/teams/easts/easts_ss.html Rugby League Tables / Season Summary / Easts] ''The World of Rugby Leauge'' Retrieved on [[13 August]] [[2006]]</ref> It was also during this period that [[Dave Brown (rugby league footballer Easts)|Dave Brown]] would set a number of point scoring records that, to this day, remain unbroken.

Despite claiming the premiership in 1945, Eastern Suburbs failed to qualify for the playoffs for the next seven seasons. It proved to be even longer before the club even looked a genuine chance to claim a premiership, with the side managing to finish runners-up in the 1960 [[Grand Final]]. In 1966, the club failed to win one game from their eighteen starts, and to this day remains the only occasion in 99 years in which this occurred, but it is also the last instance in which the Roosters won the [[wooden spoon]]. This season prompted the introduction of a club logo to appear on all jerseys the following year, with the motto "Easts to Win" printed underneath an emblem of a [[rooster]].

The seasons from 1972 to 1982 brought much success to the Roosters, who were able were able to make the finals eight times out of eleven, including four [[minor premiership]]s and four Grand Final appearances. Quite arguably the most influential reason for this success was the arrival of "Super Coach" [[Jack Gibson (rugby league)|Jack Gibson]], who took charge in 1974 with instant success. The Roosters teams of 1974 and 1975 are considered by many critics to be one of the greatest club sides ever to be assembled, with players including [[Mark Harris]], [[John Brass]], [[Bill Mullins]], [[Russell Fairfax]], [[Johnny Mayes]], [[John Peard]], [[Ron Coote]], [[Ian Schubert]] and captain [[Arthur Beetson]] making up the side.<ref>[http://www.rl1908.com/Clubs/Sydney-Roosters.htm Sydney Roosters (Eastern Suburbs)] ''RL1908.com.'' Retrieved on [[15 August]] [[2006]]</ref> During this two-year period, the side won both minor premierships, Grand Finals as well as winning 39 out of 44 matches, including a record 19-game winning streak in the latter year. The 1975 winning Grand Final scoreline of 38-0 against the [[St George Dragons]] remains the largest defeat in a First Grade Grand Final.

During the 1980s to early 1990s, the Roosters were only able to reach the semi-finals once after finishing second from the thirteen sides in 1987. This period of time became known to supporters as the "Transit Lounge" era and was brought upon by several ill-fated management decisions which would divulge the club into one of its worst eras for years. Despite the poor form of the club in these years, home crowd attendances multiplied in just over a decade. From being as low as 3,389 in 1984, just two years after taking away the minor premiership, numbers soared to 17,060 in 1996; the year in which the side first made the finals in over a decade. This included a club record attendance of 37,981 on [[22 July]], [[1996]].<ref>[http://www.stats.rleague.com/rl/crowds/easts.html Rugby League Tables / Attendances / Easts]</ref>

With a bitter [[Super League (Australia)|Super League]] war turning friends into enemies in the mid 1990s, the Roosters were able recruit star five-eighth [[Brad Fittler]] from the [[Penrith Panthers]] to once again return the Roosters to the top end of the ladder. Fittler's presence would prove to be invaluable, and during his reign the Roosters would compete in 4 Grand Finals in a period of 5 years. Although the Roosters would walk away with disappointment on 3 occasions, premiership number 12 was welcomed into the trophy cabinet in 2002 when the Roosters defeated the [[New Zealand Warriors]] 30-8. Their latest grand final appearance was in 2004, when they were defeated by the [[Canterbury Bulldogs|Bulldogs]] 16-13.

The Sydney Roosters will celebrate their centenary in 2007 having competed in all 100 seasons of first grade rugby league since 1908.

==Crest==
Like other clubs, Eastern Suburbs did not traditionally sport a crest on their jerseys in the early half of the 20th century. From time to time, other clubs would sport simple designs on their strip but it was not common to see this on all jerseys until the 1950s and 1960s. In 1967, the club introduced the first logo, displaying the motto "Easts to Win", following a winless season beforehand. The crest also incorporated a [[rooster]] in the design, with some sources suggesting that this choice of mascot followed after the Roosters changed their jersey design to suit the [[France national rugby league team|French team's]] jersey.<ref>[http://www.sydneyroosters.com.au/100years/news.php?article_id=41 Origin of the Rooster and club colours] ''Sydney Roosters minisite.'' Retrieved on [[10 August]] [[2006]]</ref> Given that the French team's mascot was affectionately known to supporters as "le coq", the rooster, connections have been made as to the choosing of a rooster for Eastern Suburbs' mascot.

The crest's design was later changed in 1978, with the motto being replaced with the words of the team's name, "Eastern Suburbs". This design was kept until 1994 when the club changed its playing name to the '''Sydney City Roosters''' for the start of the 1995 season. This also promted a change in logo design, with the image of a rooster against the backdrop of the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]] being shown. In 2000, the club changed its name once again, this time, simply, to the '''Sydney Roosters''', with the introduction of a different logo which has been used ever since.

==Colours==
Throughout the club's history, red, white and blue have been the colours that have made up the design of the jersey. Although, the style of jersey has changed since the club's inception in 1908, the club has predominantly stuck with these traditional colours. The jersey worn in the first premiership season consisted of a series of horizontal stripes, with alternating red stripes dominating over consecutive white and blue stripes. Although the width and the order of these stripes changed over the years, the basic design was maintained.

During [[World War II]], the design of the jersey had to be modified due to the clothing dye beeing needed to help with the war effort.<ref>[http://www.sydneyroosters.com.au/jersey_comp.php 100 Year Celebration - Jersey Competition] ''Sydney Roosters Rugby League 2006.'' Retrieved on [[10 August]] [[2006]]</ref> This saw Eastern Suburbs playing in different colours, as well as a different design. Instead of the alternating horizontal stripes as had been used in previous years, a sky blue base was used to back a red and white V-strip around the collar. This is the only noted time in the club's history where the traditional deep blue, red and white combination was absent from the jersey.

The V-strip design was maintained after the war, but with some modifications. The sky blue backing was reverted back to the original deeper blue present in the original jerseys. The single red and white stripes around the shirt's chest were changed slightly to a single white stripe surrounded by a red stripe on either side. This jersey appeared as early as the 1950s, and continues to be the main design to the present.

With the introduction of an alternate jersey to the premiership in the late 1990s due to design clashes with other teams, the club adopted a jersey with a similar design to what was now known as the "home jersey", simply replacing the blue backing with white, and the outer red stripe with blue. As the club entered the new century, the team began to wear a "foundation jersey". Although the design differes slightly from the jersey worn in the inaugural 1908 season, it did feature the traditional horizontal striped-design. This jersey is normally worn when the Sydney Roosters face traditional rivals, such as the [[South Sydney Rabbitohs]], or on special occasions like [[Anzac Day]] when the team faces the [[St. George-Illawarra Dragons]], the product of a team partly formed by the [[St. George Dragons]].

==Name changes==
Originally known as Eastern Suburbs District Rugby League Football Club, the Eastern Suburbs marketing name has been changed several times throughout the club's 99-year existence. In the 1960s the club brought the introduction of the Roosters emblem. In 1994 the Eastern Suburbs District Rugby League Football Club changed its marketing name to the Sydney City Roosters which also seen a new logo introduced. However in a bid to market the team to the majority of its fans who do not reside in the [[Eastern Suburbs (Sydney)|Eastern Suburbs]], the Eastern Suburbs District Rugby League Football Club changed its marketing name to the Sydney Roosters to appeal to its widening fan base.

It must be remembered that although marketing names have changed, the Roosters are still registered within the [[National Rugby League]] competiton as the Eastern Suburbs District Rugby League Football Club.<ref>[http://www.rleague.com/db/club/sydney_roosters/history.php Sydney Roosters History] ''The World of Rugby League'' Retrieved on [[10 July]] [[2006]]</ref>

==Supporters==
The Sydney Roosters boast a large supporter base throughout the entire of Australia, with the club enjoying healthy membership numbers in the [[South East Queensland]] and [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] regions as well as its traditional strongholds in Sydney.<ref>[http://www.sydneyroosters.com.au/fans/roostersaustraliawide.php Roosters Australia Wide] ''Sydney Roosters Rugby League 2006.'' Retrieved on [[9 August]] [[2006]]</ref>

At the Sydney Roosters home ground [[Aussie Stadium]], the official supporter base is divided into three prominent sections. The "Chook Pen", a designated area in Bay 36 is for the most "diehard" and "hardcore" fans. Located in the membership stands are members more willing to watch the game in a more laid back environment and enjoy the best view of the field from Bays 12, 13, & 14. The Kevin Hastings Stand is a designated area for families to watch the football in a safe alcohol-free zone.

The Sydney Roosters have two well known internet forums to keep supporters from across the country and the world in touch. The first forum is known as "The Wall", being the official supporters' internet forum of the Sydney Roosters. The other internet forum known as "The People's Wall", which remains popular despite not being affiliated with the Sydney Roosters (therefore making it an unofficial forum).

==Team song==
The current song is labelled "Rooster Man", a revamp of the original tune [[Macho Man]] performed by the [[Village People]].<ref>[http://www.sydneyroosters.com.au/100years/playvideo.php?filename=RoosterMan.mp3 Rooster Man] ''Sydney Roosters minisite.'' Retrieved on [[10 July]] [[2006]]</ref> However the traditional club song, "Here come the Roosters",<ref>[http://www.sydneyroosters.com.au/100years/playvideo.php?filename=OldEastsSong.mp3 Here come the Roosters] ''Sydney Roosters minisite.'' Retrieved on [[10 July]] [[2006]]</ref> favoured by many of the traditional fans, goes as follows:

:Easts know how to play the game, they play it hard and fair,
:Easts know how to win the game, they win more than their share.
:They're great to see in action, these boys who show the way,
:Put the Roosters on the field, they'll show you how to play.
:Here come the Roosters, the best we've ever seen,
:The red, white and bluesters, the Eastern Suburbs team.

:"Easts to win" shout the cry that everybody knows,
:If you play this football game beware the Roosters crow.
:They're great to see in action, these boys who show the way,
:Put the roosters on the field, they'll show you how to play.
:Here come the Roosters, the best we've ever seen,
:The red, white and bluesters, the Eastern Suburbs team.

==Rivalries==
'''[[South Sydney Rabbitohs]]:''' The only fellow foundation club to still be in existence, the Roosters and the [[South Sydney Rabbitohs|Rabbitohs]] share inner-[[Sydney]] territory which has produced a strong rivalry between the two since 1908. Heating up in the latter part of the century due to conflict between junior territories; the tension between fans of both camps have escalated with the increased financial success of the Roosters club oppossed to the fading finances associated with the Rabbitohs since the early 90's. In 2005 the Rabbitohs broke an 11 year losing streak to the Roosters by downing them 17-16 in an event filled match.<ref>[http://www.smh.com.au/news/league/shove-thy-neighbour-souths-rule-the-roost/2005/08/20/1124435184478.html Shove thy neighbour: Souths rule the roost] ''The Sydney Morning Herald.'' Retrieved on [[13 August]] [[2006]]</ref>

While in earlier years the Rabbitohs were able to draw key Roosters players to the Redfern based club, the Roosters extracted revenge in late 2005 with the signing of Rabbitohs captain [[Ashley Harrison]] along with South Sydney junior [[Braith Anasta]] from the [[Canterbury Bulldogs|Bulldogs]]; whom the Rabbitohs also heavily pursued.<ref>[http://www.smh.com.au/news/league/anastas-off-to-the-roosters/2005/07/11/1120934188750.html Anasta's off to the Roosters] ''The Sydney Morning Herald.'' Retrieved on [[13 August]] [[2006]]</ref>

'''[[Canterbury Bulldogs|The Bulldogs]]:''' In recent years the Bulldogs rivalry has escalated to be one of the Roosters most passionate in history. While both teams have crossed premiership paths in Grand Finals three previous times before, the most significant chapter came when the Sydney Roosters won the 2002 NRL Premiership on the back of a 10 game winning streak. Unfortunately, this was the same year the Bulldogs who were premiership favourites were stripped of 37 points due to cheating in the [[National Rugby League season 2001|2001 season]] and the [[National Rugby League season 2002|2002 season]].<ref>[http://www.smh.com.au/specials/nrlcrisis/ Secret Bulldog Business] ''The Sydney Morning Herald.'' Retrieved on [[13 August]] [[2006]]</ref> Many Bulldogs fans believe their team was the rightful premiers of that year, however, with the Roosters walking into the Grand Final on a 9-game winning streak such an outcome will never be known.

The following year both teams met up twice in emotionally charged matchups with the Bulldogs prevailing in both. However the Sydney Roosters bounced back in the game that mattered defeating the Bulldogs 28-18 in the Grand Final Qualifier. Bragging rights were short lived when in 2004 both teams met up in Grand Final with the Bulldogs prevailing as premiers 16-13. Although since the 2004 Grand Final the Sydney Roosters have enjoyed success over the Bulldogs twice, the 2004 Grand Final left a dirty taste of Roosters supporters who still hope to extract revenge upon the Canterbury-based club in the near future.
