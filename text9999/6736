'''Precipitation types''' can include the character or phase of the [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] which is falling to ground level. There are three distinct ways that [[rain]] can occur.  These methods include convective, stratiform, and orographic rainfall.  Convective precipitation is more intense, and of shorter duration, than stratiform precipitation.  Precipitation can also fall in two phases, whether liquid or solid.  Liquid forms of precipitation include rain and drizzle.  Rain or drizzle which freezes on contact within a subfreezing air mass gains the preceding word of freezing, becoming known as freezing rain or freezing drizzle.  Frozen forms of precipitation include [[snow]], [[diamond dust|ice needles]], [[sleet]], [[hail]], and [[graupel]].
__NOTOC__

==Phases==
Precipitation falls in various forms, or phases.  They can be subdivided into:

* Liquid precipitation:
** [[Drizzle]] (DZ)
** [[Rain]] (RA)

* Freezing precipitation:
** [[Freezing drizzle]] (FZDZ)
** [[Freezing rain]] (FZRA)

* Frozen precipitation:
** [[Snow]] (SN)
** [[Snow grains]] (SG)
** [[Ice pellets]] (PL)
** [[Hail]] (GR)
** [[Graupel|Snow pellets/Graupel]] (GS)
** [[Diamond dust|Ice crystals]] (IC).

== Convection ==

[[Image:Cumulonimbus-tav.jpg|thumb|250px|A large [[cumulonimbus cloud]], with rain falling out on the right.]]

Convection occurs when the Earth's surface within a conditionally unstable, or moist [[atmosphere]], becomes heated more than its surroundings, leading to significant upward motion.  [[Convection rain|Convective rain]], or showery precipitation, occurs from convective clouds, e.g., [[cumulonimbus]] or [[cumulus congestus]]. It falls as showers with rapidly changing intensity. Convective precipitation falls over a certain area for a relatively short time, as convective clouds have limited horizontal extent. Most precipitation in the [[tropics]] appears to be convective; however, it has been suggested that stratiform precipitation also occurs in mature thunderstorms.<ref name="Geerts">B. Geerts.

== Stratiform ==
{{See also|Weather fronts}}
[[Image:Warmfront.jpg|thumb|Illustration clouds overriding a [[warm front]]]]

Stratiform rainfall is caused by frontal systems surrounding [[extratropical cyclone]]s or lows, which form when warm and often tropical air meets cooler air.  When masses of air with different density (moisture and temperature characteristics) meet, warmer air overrides colder air, causing precipitation.  In turn, precipitation can enhance the temperature and moisture contrast along a frontal boundary. Fronts cause sudden, enigmatic changes in general temperature, and in the [[humidity]] and [[pressure]] in the air.  [[Warm front]]s occur where the warm air scours out a previously lodged cold air mass.  The warm air 'overrides' the cooler air and moves upward.  Warm fronts are followed by extended periods of light rain and drizzle, because, after the warm air rises above the cooler air (which sinks to the ground), it gradually cools due to the air's expansion while being lifted, which forms clouds and leads to precipitation.  Cold fronts occur when a mass of cooler air dislodges a mass of warm air.  This type of transition is sharper, since cold air is more dense than warm air.  The rain duration is less, and generally more intense, than that which occurs ahead of warm fronts.  A wide variety of weather can be found along an occluded front, with thunderstorms possible, but usually their passage is associated with a drying of the air mass.

== Orographic ==
[[Image:Steigungsregen.jpg|thumb|right|Orographic precipitation]]
[[Orography|Orographic]] or relief rainfall is caused when masses of air pushed by [[wind]] are forced up the side of elevated land formations, such as large [[mountain]]s.  The lift of the air up the side of the mountain results in [[Adiabatic lapse rate|adiabatic]] cooling, and ultimately condensation and precipitation.  In mountainous parts of the world subjected to relatively consistent winds (for example, the [[trade wind]]s), a more moist [[climate]] usually prevails on the windward side of a mountain than on the [[leeward]] (downwind) side.  Moisture is removed by orographic lift, leaving drier air (see [[katabatic wind]]) on the descending (generally warming), leeward side where a [[rain shadow]] is observed.<ref name="MT">Physical Geography.

In [[Hawaii]], [[Mount Wai<U+02BB>ale<U+02BB>ale]] (''Wai{{okina}}ale{{okina}}ale''), on the island of Kauai, is notable for its extreme rainfall, as it has the second highest average annual rainfall on Earth, with {{convert|460|in|mm}}.<ref>Diana Leone. [http://starbulletin.com/2002/05/27/news/story3.html Rain supreme.] Retrieved on [[2008-03-19]].</ref>  Storm systems affect the state with heavy rains between October and March.  Local climates vary considerably on each island due to their topography, divisible into windward (''Ko{{okina}}olau'') and leeward (''Kona'') regions based upon location relative to the higher mountains.  Windward sides face the east to northeast [[trade winds]] and receive much more rainfall; leeward sides are drier and sunnier, with less rain and less cloud cover.<ref>Western Regional Climate Center.

== Effective rainfall ==

Effective rainfall is defined as that part of the precipitation that reaches stream and river channels as direct runoff (as opposed to that which is intercepted by vegetation or lost as evaporation).<ref>Glossary of Meteorology.
