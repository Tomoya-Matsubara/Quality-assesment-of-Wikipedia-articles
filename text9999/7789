'''John Coolidge Adams''' (born [[February 15]] [[1947]]) is an [[United States|American]] [[composer]], with strong roots in [[minimalist music|minimalism]].

==Life and career==
John Adams was born in Worcester, Massachusetts in 1947. His father taught him how to play the clarinet and he played in several community ensembles while he was growing up. He began composing at the age of ten and heard his first orchestral piece performed when he was thirteen. Adams studied music at [[Harvard University|Harvard]] and graduated in 1971. He moved to California in 1971 to teach at the [[San Francisco Conservatory of Music]], a position he held for ten years. His notable students there include [[Jin Hi Kim]].

John Adams' first recorded work was included on [[Brian Eno]]'s [[Obscure Records]] LP "Ensemble Pieces", 1975.
He won a [[Grammy Award]] in 1989 in the [[Grammy Award for Best Classical Contemporary Composition|Best Contemporary Composition]] category for ''[[Nixon in China (opera)|Nixon in China]]'' and in 1998 in the same category for ''[[El Dorado (John Adams)|El Dorado]]''.

Adams' work ''[[On the Transmigration of Souls]]'', a choral work commemorating the victims of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], won the 2003 [[Pulitzer Prize for Music]].  However, after winning the award Adams expressed "ambivalence bordering on contempt" since he felt that the prize had "lost much of the prestige it still carries in other fields" because "most of the country's greatest musical minds" have been ignored in favor of academy composers and musicians.

The [[Los Angeles Philharmonic]] conducted by [[Esa-Pekka Salonen]] gave the world premier of "Naive and Sentimental Music" in 1998, with Adams dedicating the piece to Salonen.  Salonen and the Los Angeles Philharmonic subsequently gave the world premiere of "The Dharma at Big Sur" (with Tracy Silverman as electric violin soloist) in 2003 as part of the opening gala concerts of [[Walt Disney Concert Hall]].

Adams's newest opera, ''[[Doctor Atomic]]'', which premiered October 1, 2005, is also a collaboration with [[Peter Sellars]].  The action of the opera is centered on the very first test of the atomic bomb, and is mainly about [[J. Robert Oppenheimer|Robert Oppenheimer]]. Adams later adapted some of the music from the opera to form a standalone symphony. The symphony premiered under the BBC Philharmonic in August of 2007, but was later heavily revised and received its American premiere under the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra on February 8, 2008. The first performance totaled at about 45 minutes, while the performance under the SLSO was only about 25 minutes.

John Adams became the [[BBC Symphony Orchestra]]'s Artist in Association in June 2003. In the words of Adams himself, "the position is sufficiently unstructured and flexible to allow any number of wild things to happen."  On [[23 November]] [[2004]], the British Academy presented a Fellowship of the Academy to John Adams at the [[Barbican]], [[London]], following a concert with the BBC Symphony Orchestra and [[BBC Symphony Chorus|Chorus]] conducted by the composer and including his work ''[[Harmonium (John Adams)|Harmonium]]''.

In [[Grammy Awards of 2005|2005]], the premiere recording of ''[[On the Transmigration of Souls]]'' (with [[Lorin Maazel]] conducting the [[New York Philharmonic]])  won three [[Grammy awards]]:  [[Grammy Award for Best Classical Album|Best Classical Album]], [[Best Orchestral Performance]], and [[Best Classical Contemporary Composition]].   Other recent prizes include the [http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=518675 Harvard Arts medal] for 2007.
