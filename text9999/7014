==Recording and release==
{{refimprove|date=January 2011}}
Throughout the recording of ''Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends'', Coldplay communicated to fans through their website, some of the songs names were revealed during the recording. The name "Poppyfields" was first revealed in September 2007, in late October 2007, a message said that "Famous Old Painters" and "Glass of Water", had been written and were being considered for the album, "Prospekt's March" appeared for the first time in December of the same year, all the notes were signed by the pseudonym Prospekt, strengthening rumours that this would be the album's title. But those songs never made to the album's final tracklisting, so were featured on the Prospekt's March EP, except for Famous Old Painters that was never released.

In an interview for Coldplay's official website Chris Martin said that all the songs on the EP came very close to be on ''Viva la Vida'', and that they were "all part of the same family". On the same interview the frontman stated that the idea was always to put these songs out by the end of 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coldplay.com/newsdetail.php?id=204&page=0|title=Chis Martin's Interview for Coldplay.com}}</ref>

==Track listing==
Coldplay confirmed five songs for ''Prospekt's March'' on 3 October 2008, all of which had not been completed in time for ''Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends''.<ref name="Chris Martin's Diary Entry - Coldplay.com" /> The playlist was changed to eight songs on 5 October.<ref name=cp_081005>{{cite web|title=Prospekt's March Tracklisting|author=Martin, Chris|date=2008-10-05|url=http://www.coldplay.com/newsdetail.php?id=153|publisher=Coldplay.com|accessdate=2008-10-06}}</ref> Six of the eight tracks are new recordings of the band.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1043868/coldplay-preps-ep-with-jay-z-guest-spot|title=Coldplay Preps EP With Jay-Z Guest Spot|last=Cohen|first=Jonathan|date=2008-10-06|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc|accessdate=2008-10-07}}</ref>
