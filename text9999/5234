}}'''Martin Nathaniel Dahlin''' (born April 16, 1968 in [[Uddevalla]]) is a former [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[football (soccer)|football]] player.

==Early life==

He is the son of an Afro-Venezuelan father, who was a musician, and a white Swedish mother who both named him after [[Martin Luther King]].<ref name="Dahlin Is Swedish Player First">{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/10/sports/world-cup-94-dahlin-is-swedish-player-first-pioneer-a-distant-second.html?pagewanted=all |title= Dahlin Is Swedish Player First, Pioneer a Distant Second |publisher=NY Times|author=Christopher Clarey|date=1994-07-10|accessdate=2009-07-08}}</ref> He was born in [[Uddevalla]], but lived as a child in [[Lund]].<ref name="Dahlin Is Swedish Player First"/>

==Career==

In 1988, he became the first black player to represent [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]].<ref name="Skill, not race">{{cite news |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=888&dat=19940708&id=1tANAAAAIBAJ&sjid=nHYDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6437,2596102|title= Skill, not race, separates Dahlin |publisher=st. Petersburg Times|author=Dwight Chapin|date=1994-07-08|accessdate=2009-07-08}}</ref> He was part of the Swedish national team which finished 3rd in the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]], scoring four goals in the tournament. He also participated in the team which reached the semifinals of [[Euro 92]]. 

In 1993 he was selected as best Swedish player of the year, winning [[Guldbollen]].<ref name="Skill, not race"/>

He has played for [[Malm<U+00F6> FF]], [[Borussia M<U+00F6>nchengladbach]], [[AS Roma]], [[Hamburger SV]] and [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]]. The most time of his career he spent with Borussia M<U+00F6>nchengladbach with whom he won the [[German Cup]] in 1995 along with [[Stefan Effenberg]].

Dahlin transferred from AS Roma to Blackburn Rovers in mid-1997 and made 21 appearances in the 1997-1998 season, scoring 4 goals.

In the 1998-1999 season, he only played 5 games when an injury in a training game ruled him out for the rest of the season and contributed to his retirement from the game after a short spell at Hamburger SV in 1999.

Blackburn Rovers later sued their insurance company who had refused to pay out over the injury claiming that normal wear and tear could have been a contributing factor. Although the initial verdict was given in favour of the club, in 2005 the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] overturned the verdict and sent it back to the lower court. On April 12, 2006 the High Court ruled in favour of the insurance company, decreeing that the player probably had a pre-existing condition.[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/b/blackburn_rovers/4904286.stm] This decision leaves Blackburn about <U+00A3>4 million [[Out-of-pocket expenses|out-of-pocket]].  

Dahlin now lives in Sweden. He is a sports agent, and lends his name to a clothing line.[http://www.dahlin.nu] He speaks three languages - [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[English language|English]] and [[German language|German]].<ref name="Skill, not race"/>
