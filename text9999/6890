The '''Medal of Honor''' is the [[United States|United States of America's]] highest [[Awards and decorations of the United States military|military honor]], awarded for personal acts of [[Courage|valor]] above and beyond the call of duty.  The medal is awarded by the [[President of the United States]] in the name of [[United States Congress|Congress]]. There are three versions of the medal, one for the [[United States Army|Army]], one for the [[United States Navy|Navy]], and one for the [[United States Air Force|Air Force]].  Members of the [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] and [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] receive the Navy Medal of Honor.

The Medal of Honor is usually presented by the President at the [[White House]] in a formal ceremony intended to represent the gratitude of the American people, with posthumous presentations made to the primary next of kin.<ref name="posthumousQuantification">{{Cite book|last=Pullen|first=John J.|title=A Shower of Stars: The Medal of Honor and the 27th Maine|publisher=Stackpole Books|location=Mechanicsburg, PA|year=1997|pages=preface p2|url=http://books.google.com/?id=xGtImta-9QEC&dq=Pullen+A+Shower+of+stars&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=&f=falseMany|accessdate=April 15, 2010 |isbn=978-0-8117-0075-7}}</ref><ref>SECNAVINST 1650.1H, P. 2-20, 224. 2., Aug 22, 2006</ref>  In 1990, Congress designated March 25 annually as "National Medal of Honor Day".<ref>Public Law 101-564, Nov. 15, 1990</ref>  Due to its prestige and status, the Medal of Honor is afforded special protection under U.S. law against any unauthorized adornment, sale or manufacture, which includes any associated ribbon or badge.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://us-code.vlex.com/vid/sec-military-medals-decorations-19190976 |title=18 USC 704 - Sec. 704.

==History==
[[File:Ortega meda of Honor.jpg|upright|thumb|Medal of Honor (without the suspension ribbon) awarded to [[Seaman]] [[John Ortega]] in 1864 (back view of medal).]]
* 1780:  The [[Fidelity Medallion]] was a small medal worn on a chain around the neck, similar to a [[religious]] medal, that was awarded only to three [[militiamen]] from [[New York state]], for the capture of [[John Andr<U+00E9>]], a [[United Kingdom|British]] officer and spy connected directly to General [[Benedict Arnold]] (American and British general-1780) during the [[American Revolutionary War]] (1775<U+2013>1783). The capture saved [[West Point]] (fort) from the British Army.

* 1782: [[Badge of Military Merit]]: The first formal system for rewarding acts of individual gallantry by American soldiers was established by [[George Washington]] when he issued a field order on August 7, 1782, for a Badge of Military Merit to recognize those members of the [[Continental Army]] who performed "any singular meritorious action". This decoration is America's first combat decoration and was preceded only by the Fidelity Medallion, the Congressional medal for Henry Lee awarded in September 1779 in recognition of his attack on the British at Paulus Hook, the Congressional medal for General Horatio Gates awarded in November 1777 in recognition of his victory over the British at Saratoga, and the Congressional medal for George Washington awarded in March 1776.<ref name="regulations"/><ref name="merit">{{cite web|author=[[United States Army Center of Military History]]|url=http://www.history.army.mil/faq/purhrt.htm|title=The Badge Of Military Merit/The Purple Heart|accessdate= July 23, 2006|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060718225026/http://www.army.mil/cmh-pg/reference/PurHrt.htm|archivedate=July 18, 2006}}</ref><ref>Dept. of the Army Public Information Division, ''The Medal of Honor of the United States Army '' (Washington, DC: US Government Printing Office, 1948), 10-11.</ref> Although the Badge of Military Merit fell into disuse after the American Revolutionary War, the concept of a [[military award]] for individual gallantry by members of the [[U.S. Armed Forces]] had been established.

* 1847:  [[Certificate of Merit]]: After the outbreak of the [[Mexican-American War]] (1846<U+2013>1848) a [[Certificate of Merit Medal|Certificate of Merit]] was established in 1847 for soldiers who distinguished themselves in action. The certificate was discontinued and reintroduced in 1876. In 1918, the certificate was granted medal status as the [[Certificate of Merit Medal]].<ref name="Zabecki2008">{{cite book|last=Zabecki|first=David T. |title=American Artillery and the Medal of Honor|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=gAttr-hmghUC&pg=PA11|accessdate=March 14, 2012|year=2008|publisher=[[Lulu (company)|Lulu.com]]|isbn=978-1-4357-5541-3|page=11}}</ref>

* 1861:  There were no military awards or medals at the beginning of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] (1861<U+2013>1865) except for the Certificate of Merit which was awarded for the Mexican-American War.  In the fall of 1861, a proposal for a battlefield decoration for [[Courage|valor]] was memorandumed to [[Winfield Scott]], the general-in-chief of the army, by Lt. Colonel [[Edward D. Townsend]], an assistant adjutant at the [[United States Department of War|War Department]] and Scott's chief of staff. Scott however, was strictly against medals being awarded which was the European tradition. After Scott retired in October 1861, the [[Secretary of the Navy]], [[Gideon Welles]], adopted the idea of a decoration to recognize and honor distinguished naval service. On October 9, [[U.S. Senator]] ([[Iowa]]) [[James W. Grimes]], Chairman on the Committee on Naval Affairs, proposed Public Resolution Number 82,<ref>"Above and Beyond", P. 5, 1985, Boston Publishing Company</ref> "to promote the efficiency of the Navy" which included a provision for a Navy Medal of Valor<ref>"Stealing the General", P. 308, by Russell S.

The resolution was approved by Congress and signed into law on July 12, 1862. This measure provided for awarding a medal of honor "to such non-commissioned officers and privates as shall most distinguish themselves by their gallantry in action and other soldier-like qualities during the present insurrection". During the war, Townsend would have some medals delivered to some recipients with a letter requesting acknowledgement of the "Medal of Honor". The letter written and signed by Townsend on behalf of the Secretary of War, stated that the resolution was "to provide for the presentation of medals of honor to the enlisted men of the army and volunteer forces who have distinguished or may distinguish themselves in battle during the present rebellion".<ref>"Above and Beyond", by Boston Publishing Company, 2006</ref><ref>Quote is from what is written on War Dept. return receipt letter dated March 1865 signed by asst. adjutant Edward Townsend that accompanied the Medal of Honor delivered to Private Franklin Johndro for his act on Sept. 30, 1864, capturing 49 armed Confederate soldiers.</ref> By mid-November the War Department contracted with Philadelphia [[silversmith]] William Wilson and Son, who had been responsible for the Navy design, to prepare 2,000 Army medals to be cast at the mint.<ref>"Above and Beyond", by Boston Publishing Company, P. 5, 2nd paragraph, 1985</ref> The Army version had "The Congress to" written on the back of the medal.

There are three versions of the Medal of Honor, one for each of the [[Organizational structure of the United States Department of Defense|military departments]] of the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]]: Army, Navy, and Air Force.  Members of the Marine Corps and Coast Guard are eligible to receive the Navy version.  Each is constructed differently and the components are made from gilding metals and red [[brass]] alloys with some gold plating, enamel, and bronze pieces.  The United States Congress considered a bill in 2004 which would require the Medal of Honor to be made with 90% gold, the same composition as the lesser-known [[Congressional Gold Medal]], but the measure was dropped.<ref name=ABC-GoldorBrass>{{cite news|last=Martin|first=John|title=Medal of Honor: Gold or Brass?|url=http://abcnews.go.com/WNT/story?id=130511&page=1#.UFu-W41mTYg|accessdate=21 September 2012|newspaper=ABC News|date=5 February 2004}}</ref>

===Historical versions===
The Medal of Honor has evolved in appearance over time.  The upside-down star design of the Navy version's pendant adopted in early 1862 has not changed since its inception.  The Army 1862 version followed and was identical to the Navy version except an eagle perched atop cannons was used instead of an anchor to connect the pendant to the suspension ribbon.  In 1896, the Army version changed the ribbon's design and colors due to misuse and imitation by nonmilitary organizations.<ref name=TIOH-MOH />  In 1904, the Army "[[George Lewis Gillespie, Jr.|Gillespie]]" version introduced a smaller redesigned star and the ribbon was changed to the light blue pattern with white stars seen today.<ref name=TIOH-MOH /> In 1913, the Navy version adopted the same ribbon pattern.

{{main|Tiffany Cross Medal of Honor}}
After World War I, the Navy decided to separate the Medal of Honor into two versions, one for combat and one for non-combat.  The original upside-down star was designated as the non-combat version and a new pattern of the medal pendant, in cross form, was designed by the [[Tiffany & Co.|Tiffany Company]] in 1919.  It was to be presented to a sailor or Marine who "in action involving actual conflict with the enemy, distinguish[es] himself conspicuously by gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty"<ref>{{cite web|last=US Naval History & Heritage Command|title=The Medal of Honor -- Navy Medals of Honor, 1861-1941 -- The "Tiffany Cross" pattern|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/photos/awd/us-indiv/moh-3t.htm|publisher=Department of the Navy|accessdate=30 November 2012|date=23 January 2008|author=Naval History & Heritage Command}}</ref>  Despite the "actual conflict" guidelines, the ''Tiffany Cross'' was awarded to [[Floyd Bennett]] and [[Richard E. Byrd]] for arctic exploration. The ''Tiffany Cross'' was not popular.  In 1942, the Navy returned to using only the original 1862 inverted 5-point star design, and ceased issuing the award for non-combat action.<ref>{{cite web|last=Birnie|first=Michael|title="Tiffany" Medal of Honor Comes to Navy Museum|url=http://www.navy.mil/submit/display.asp?story_id=7048|publisher=The Navy Museum Public Affairs|accessdate=30 November 2012|date=27 April 2003}}</ref>

In 1944, the suspension ribbons for both the Army and Navy version were replaced with the now familiar neck ribbon.<ref name=TIOH-MOH />  When the Air Force version was designed in 1956, it incorporated similar elements and design from the Army version. It used a larger star with the Statue of Liberty image in place of Minerva on the medal and changed the connecting device from an eagle to a pair of wings with thunderbolts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iowahistory.org/museum/exhibits/medal-of-honor/medal-of-honor-history/war.htm |title=Medal of Honor History |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |work=Exhibits |publisher=State Historical Society of Iowa |accessdate=28 January 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=History in Blue |author=Robert F.

[[File:Medal of Honor Flag with Gold Fringe.svg|thumb|Medal of Honor Flag]]
On October 23, 2002, {{USPL|107|248}} was enacted, modifying {{UnitedStatesCode|36|903}}, authorizing a Medal of Honor flag to be presented to recipients of the decoration.<ref name="flaglaw">{{cite web|date = 23 October 2002 |url = http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/36C9.txt |title = Designation of the Medal of Honor Flag |publisher = US Code.gov |accessdate = July 23, 2006}}</ref>

The flag was based on a concept by retired [[U.S. Army Special Forces|Army Special Forces]] First Sergeant Bill Kendall of [[Jefferson, Iowa]],<ref name="Kendall">{{cite web|url = http://www4.army.mil/news/article.php?story=7244|title = Special Forces veteran's idea leads to new Medal of Honor flag |publisher = Army News Service|accessdate = July 24, 2006|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060111151709/http://www4.army.mil/news/article.php?story=7244 |archivedate = January 11, 2006|deadurl=yes}}</ref> who designed a flag to honor Medal of Honor recipient Captain [[Darrell Lindsey]], a [[B-26 Marauder|B-26]] pilot from Jefferson who was killed in World War II. Kendall's design of a light blue field emblazoned with 13 white five-pointed stars was nearly identical to that of Sarah LeClerc's of the [[U.S. Army Institute of Heraldry|Institute of Heraldry]]. LeClerc's design, ultimately accepted as the official flag, does not include the words "Medal of Honor" and is fringed in gold. The color of the field and the 13 white stars, arranged in the form of a three bar [[Chevron (insignia)|chevron]], consisting of two chevrons of five stars and one chevron of three stars,<ref name="regulations"/> replicate the suspension ribbon of the Medal of Honor. The flag has no set proportions.<ref name="flag">{{cite web|url = http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/Flags_Guidons/MedalOfHonorFlag.htm |title = Medal of Honor Flag |work = The Institute of Heraldry |publisher = US Army |accessdate = July 21, 2006| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060911012812/http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/Flags_Guidons/MedalOfHonorFlag.htm| archivedate = September 11, 2006}}</ref>

There are two distinct protocols for awarding the Medal of Honor. The first and most common is nomination and approval through the [[chain of command]] of the service member. The second method is nomination by a member of the U.S. Congress, generally at the request of a constituent, and the subsequent approval via a special [[Act of Congress]]. In both cases, the Medal of Honor is presented by the President on behalf of, and in the name of, the Congress.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.army.mil/moh.html |title=Medal of Honor Citations |publisher=History.army.mil |date=June 4, 2008 |accessdate=January 3, 2012}}</ref> Since 1941, more than half of the Medals of Honor have been awarded posthumously.<ref>{{cite news |title=Marine posthumously awarded Medal of Honor |author=Jeff Schogol |author2=Leoo Shane III |url=http://www.stripes.com/news/marine-posthumously-awarded-medal-of-honor-1.59068 |newspaper=Stars and Stripes |date=12 January 2007 |accessdate=28 January 2013 |quote=At the ceremony, Bush noted that more than half of the Medal of Honor recipients since World War II have died earning it. }}</ref> Medal of Honor recipients are usually personally decorated by the President.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.c-span.org/Events/Medal-of-Honor-Recipients-Tell-Their-Stories/10737435807/ |title=Medal of Honor Recipients Tell Their Stories |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=21 November 2012 |work=C-SPAN |publisher=National Cable Satellite Corporation |accessdate=28 January 2013 |quote=The Medal of Honor is the highest U.S. military honor and is usually presented by the President of the United States. }}</ref> If the Medal of Honor is awarded posthumously it is presented to the recipient's family.<ref>{{usc|10|3752}}</ref>

===Evolution of criteria===
* 1800s: Several months after President Abraham Lincoln signed Public Resolution 82 into law on December 21, 1861 for a Navy medal of honor, a similar resolution was passed in July 1862 for an Army version of the medal. Six [[Union Army]] soldiers who [[Great Locomotive Chase|hijacked]] a [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] [[locomotive]] named the ''[[General]]'' in 1862, were the first [[Medal of Honor recipients]];<ref name="MWxvii">{{harvnb|Mikaelian|Wallace|2003|p=xvii}}</ref> [[James J. Andrews]], a civilian, led the raid. He was caught and hanged as a Union spy, but was not awarded the medal. Many Medals of Honor awarded in the 19th century were associated with, "saving the flag" (and country), not just for patriotic reasons, but because the [[U.S. flag]] was a primary means of battlefield communication at the time. Because no other military decoration was authorized during the Civil War, some seemingly less exceptional and notable actions were recognized by a Medal of Honor during that conflict.

* 1900s: Early in the 20th century, the Navy awarded many Medals of Honor for peacetime bravery. For instance, in 1901, [[John Henry Helms]] aboard the {{USS|Chicago|CA-14}} was awarded the medal for saving the ship's cook from drowning. Seven sailors aboard the {{USS|Iowa|BB-4}} were awarded the medal after the ship's boiler exploded on January 25, 1904. [[Richard Evelyn Byrd|Richard Byrd]] and [[Floyd Bennett]] were awarded the medal after [[World War I]] for the exploration of the [[North Pole]].<ref name="HargisSinton2003">{{cite book|last1=argis|first1=Robert H|last2=Sinton|first2=Starr |title=World War II Medal of Honor recipients (1): Navy & USMC|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=JdGr1QFy9HwC&pg=PA6|accessdate=March 14, 2012|year=2003|publisher=Osprey Publishing|isbn=978-1-84176-613-3|page=6}}</ref> And, [[Thomas J. Ryan (admiral)|Admiral Thomas J. Ryan]] was awarded the medal for saving a woman from the burning Grand Hotel in [[Yokohama]], Japan, following the 1923 [[Great Kant<U+014D> earthquake]].<ref name="ryan">{{cite web|url = http://www.history.army.mil/html/moh/interim1920-40.html |title = Medal of Honor Recipients, Interim Awards 1920<U+2013>1940 |publisher = [[United States Army Center of Military History]] |accessdate = July 23, 2006}}</ref> Between 1919 and 1942, the Navy issued two separate versions of the Medal of Honor, one for acts related to combat and one for non-combat bravery. The criteria for the award tightened during World War I for the Army version of the Medal of Honor, while the Navy version retained a non-combat provision until 1963.  In an Act of Congress of July 9, 1918, the War Department version of the medal required that the recipient "distinguish himself conspicuously by gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty," and also required that the act of valor be performed "in action involving actual conflict with an enemy."<ref name="Act of July 9, 1918, 40 Stat. 870">Act of July 9, 1918, 40 Stat. 870.</ref>  This was in reaction to the results of the Army Medal of Honor Review Board, which struck 911 names from the Medal of Honor Roll in February 1917 for lack of basic prerequisites.  These included the members of the 27th Maine erroneously awarded the medal for reenlisting to guard the capital during the Civil War, 29 members of Abraham Lincoln's funeral detail, and six civilians including Buffalo Bill Cody and Mary Walker.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmohs.org/medal-history.php |title=History of the Medal of Honor |publisher=CMOHS.org |date= |accessdate=2012-11-15}}</ref>

* World War II: Starting in 1942, the Medal would only be awarded for action in combat, although the Navy version of the Medal of Honor technically allowed non-combat awards until 1963.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq38-1.htm|title=The Navy's Medal of Honor|accessdate=January 26, 2012|publisher=US Navy}}</ref> Official accounts vary, but generally, the Medal of Honor for combat was known as the "Tiffany Cross", after [[Tiffany & Co.|the company that designed the medal]]. The Tiffany Cross was first awarded in 1919, but was unpopular partly because of its design.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news.navy.mil/search/display.asp?story_id=7048|title="Tiffany" Medal of Honor Comes to Navy Museum|date=2003-04-27|last=Birnie|first=Michael|publisher=United States Navy|work=[[U.S. Navy Museum]]|accessdate=February 15, 2010}}</ref> The Tiffany Cross Medal of Honor was awarded twice for non-combat. By a special authorized [[Act of Congress]], the medal was presented to Commander (later Rear Admiral) Richard Byrd and Floyd Bennett for their flight over the North Pole in 1926.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Above and Beyond: The Aviation Medals of Honor |first=Barrett |last=Tillman |publisher=Smithsonian Institution Press |location=Washington, D.C. |year=2003 |page=3}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://encyclopediavirginia.org/media_player?mets_filename=evm00000779mets.xml |title=Encyclopedia Virginia |publisher=Encyclopedia Virginia |date=February 19, 1927 |accessdate=May 26, 2012}}</ref> In 1942, the United States Navy reverted back to a single Medal of Honor, although the statute still contained a loophole allowing the award for both "action involving actual conflict with the enemy" or "in the line of his profession."<ref>"An Act to Amend the Act Approved February 4, 1919 (40 Stat. 1056)," August 7, 1942, Public Law 702, 56 Stat. 743-45."</ref> Arising from these criteria, approximately 60 percent of the medals earned during and after World War II have been awarded posthumously.<ref name="mohstats">{{cite web|month = May | year = 2003 |url = http://www.history.army.mil/html/moh/mohstats.html |title = Medal of Honor Statistics |publisher = [[United States Army Center of Military History]] |accessdate = July 23, 2006}}</ref>

* Public Law 88-77, July 25, 1963: The requirements for the Medal of Honor were standardized among all the services, requiring that a recipient had "distinguished himself conspicuously by gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty."<ref>"An Act to Amend Titles 10, 14, and 38, United States Code, with Respect to the Award of Certain Medals and the Medal of Honor Roll," July 25, 1956, HR 2998, Public Law 88-77, 77 Stat. 93.</ref>  Thus, the act removed the loophole allowing non-combat awards to Navy personnel. The act also clarified that the act of valor must occur during one of three circumstances:<ref>DoD Awards Manual 1348.33, V1, Oct. 12, 2011 (Nov. 23, 2010). p. 31--32, 8. Medal of Honor (1) (a) 1., 2., 3. (k),  ''p. 10, Title 10 US Code'' sections 3741, 6241, and 8741 (''Titles 14 & 38 not referenced by DoD'')</ref>
# While engaged in action against an enemy of the United States
# While engaged in military operations involving conflict with an opposing foreign force.
# While serving with friendly foreign forces engaged in an armed conflict against an opposing armed force in which the United States is not a belligerent party.<ref name="United States Code 1963">"An Act to Amend Titles 10, 14, and 38, United States Code, with Respect to the Award of Certain Medals and the Medal of Honor Roll," July 25, 1963, HR 2998, Public Law 88-77, 77 Stat. 93.</ref><ref>DoD Manual 1348.33, V1, Oct. 12. 2011 (Nov. 23, 2010), p. 31 & 32, 8.

Congress drew the three permutations of combat from President Kennedy's executive order of April 25, 1962, which previously added the same criteria to the Purple Heart. On August 24, Kennedy added similar criteria for the Bronze Star Medal.<ref name="HR2998 1963">"Subcommittee No.2 Consideration of HR2998, A Bill to Amend Titles 10, 14, and 38, United States Code, with Respect to the Award of Certain Medals and the Medal of Honor Roll," House of Representatives, Committee of Armed Services, June 6, 1963.</ref><ref>Executive order 11046 - DoD Awards Manual 1348.33, V3, Oct. 12, 2011 (Nov. 23, 2010), p. 19--21, 4. Bronze Star Medal (Title 10 & 37 is referenced by DoD, Titles 14 & 38 is not referenced by DoD)</ref>  The amendment was necessary because Cold War armed conflicts did not qualify for consideration under previous statutes such as the 1918 Army Medal of Honor Statute that required valor "in action involving actual conflict with an enemy," since the United States has not formally declared war since World War II as a result of the provisions of the United Nations Charter.<ref>"An Act Making Appropriations for the Support of the Army for the Fiscal Year Ending June Thirtieth, Nineteen Hundred and Nineteen," July 9, 1918, HR12281, Public Law 193, 40 Stat. 870.</ref>  According to congressional testimony by the Army's Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel, the services were seeking authority to award the Medal of Honor and other valor awards retroactive to July 1, 1958, in areas such as Berlin, Lebanon, Quemoy and Matsu Islands, Taiwan Straits, Congo, Laos, Vietnam, and Cuba.<ref name="HR2998 1963"/>  

Note: In 1968, Navy Captain [[William McGonagle]] (1925<U+2013>1999) was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions during the [[USS Liberty incident|USS ''Liberty'' incident]] on June 8--9, 1967.

Some congressmen objected to Lindbergh's award because it contradicted the 1918 statute, but Representative Snell reportedly quelled this dissent by explaining that "it was and it wasn't the Congressional Medal of Honor which Lindbergh would receive under his bill; that the Lindbergh medal would be entirely distinct from the valor award for war service."<ref>C.B. Allen, "Bravey vs. Ballyhoo: How America Honors Her Heroes of the Air," ''Outlook and Independent'', January 7, 1931, 13.</ref> 
* Major General (Retired) [[Adolphus Greely]], 1935, was awarded the medal "for his life of splendid public service" on his 91st birthday.  The result of a special act of Congress similar to Lindbergh's, Greely's medal citation did not reference any acts of valor.<ref>William Putnam, ''Arctic Superstars: The Scientific Exploration and Study of High Mountain Elevations and of the Regions Lying Within or about the Arctic and Antarctic Circles '' (Boulder, CO: American Alpine Club, 2001), 171.</ref>

Michael J. Blassie through the use of DNA identification.  Blassie's family asked for his Medal of Honor, but the request was denied by the Department of Defense in 1998.  According to Undersecretary of Defense Rudy de Leon, the medal was awarded symbolically to all Vietnam unknowns, not to Blassie specifically.<ref>"Medal Of Honor Won't Join Once-unknown Pilot," ''Chicago Tribune'', August 23, 1998.</ref>

==27th Maine and other revoked awardings==
[[File:Medal of Honor monument, Austin, TX IMG 2206.JPG|right|thumb|A Medal of Honor monument at the [[Texas State Cemetery]] in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], [[Texas]]]]

During the Civil War, [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Edwin M. Stanton]] promised a Medal of Honor to every man in the [[27th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment]] who extended his enlistment beyond the agreed-upon date. The Battle of Gettysburg was imminent, and 311 men of the regiment volunteered to serve until the battle was resolved. The remaining men returned to Maine, but with the Union victory at Gettysburg the 311 volunteers soon followed. The volunteers arrived back in Maine in time to be discharged with the men who had earlier returned. Since there seemed to be no official list of the 311 volunteers, the [[United States Department of War|War Department]] exacerbated the situation by forwarding 864 medals to the commanding officer of the regiment. The commanding officer only issued the medals to the volunteers who stayed behind and retained the others on the grounds that, if he returned the remainder to the War Department, the War Department would try to reissue the medals.<ref name="MWxix">{{harvnb|Mikaelian|Wallace|2003|p=xix}}</ref>

In 1916, a board of five Army generals on the retired list convened under act of law to review every Army Medal of Honor awarded. The board was to report on any Medals of Honor awarded or issued for any cause other than distinguished service. The commission, led by [[Nelson A. Miles]], identified 911 awards for causes other than distinguished service. This included the 864 medals awarded to members of the 27th Maine regiment, 29 who served as Abraham Lincoln's funeral guard, six civilians, including Dr. Mary Edwards Walker and [[Buffalo Bill|Buffalo Bill Cody]], and 12 others.<ref name="MWxxv">{{harvnb|Mikaelian|Wallace|2003|p=xxv}}</ref><ref name=CD15>{{harvnb|Collier|Del Calzo|2006|p=15}}</ref> Dr. Walker's medal was restored by President [[Jimmy Carter]] in 1977.<ref name="walker"/> Cody and four other civilian scouts who rendered distinguished service in action, and who were therefore considered by the board to have fully earned their medals, had theirs restored in 1989.<ref name=CD16>{{harvnb|Collier|Del Calzo|2006|p=16}}</ref> The report was endorsed by the [[Judge Advocate General's Corps|Judge Advocate General]], who also advised that the War Department should not seek the return of the revoked medals from the recipients identified by the board. In the case of recipients who continued to wear the medal, the War Department was advised to take no action to enforce the statute.<ref>66th Congress 1st Session, Document 58, General Staff and Medals of Honor, ordered to be printed 23 July 1919.</ref>

==Past racial discrimination==
* A 1993 study commissioned by the U.S. Army investigated racial discrimination in the awarding of medals.<ref name="African">{{cite web|url = http://www.history.army.mil/html/moh/mohb.html |title = WWII African American MOH recipients |publisher= [[United States Army Center of Military History]] |accessdate = July 20, 2006}}</ref> At the time, no Medals of Honor had been awarded to American soldiers of [[African descent]] who served in World War II. After an exhaustive review of files, the study recommended that ten of their [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Cross]] recipients be awarded the Medal of Honor. On January 13, 1997, President [[Bill Clinton]] presented the Medal of Honor to seven of these World War II veterans, six of them posthumously.  With the passing of [[Vernon Baker]], a former [[U.S. Infantry]] [[Officer (armed forces)|Officer]] on July 13, 2010, all of these recipients are deceased.<ref name=CD25/>

* In 1998, a similar study of [[Asian American]]s resulted in President [[Bill Clinton]] presenting 21 Medals of Honor in 2000. Twenty of these medals went to American soldiers of [[Japanese people|Japanese]] descent of the [[442nd Regimental Combat Team]] that served in the [[European Theater of Operations]] during World War II. One of these Medal of Honor recipients was Senator from Hawaii, [[Daniel Inouye]], a former U.S. Infantry officer.<ref name=CD25>{{harvnb|Collier|Del Calzo|2006|p=25}}</ref>

* In 2005, President [[George W. Bush]] presented the Medal of Honor to [[Tibor Rubin]], a [[Jewish American]] who was a [[Holocaust survivor]] of World War II and U.S. Infantry [[POW]] of the [[Korean War]] whom many believed to have been overlooked because of his [[religion]].<ref name="Asian">{{cite web|last =Williams |first = Rdui |date = May 19, 2000 |url = http://www.defenselink.mil/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=45192 |title = 21 Asian American World War II Vets to Get Medal of Honor |work = American Forces Press Service News Articles |publisher = Department of Defense |accessdate = July 21, 2008}}</ref><ref name="JewishLib">{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/tibor_rubin.html|title=Tibor Rubin|publisher=Jewish Virtual Library|accessdate=July 21, 2008}}</ref>

==Similar decorations within the United States==
The following United States decorations, in one degree or another, bear similar names to the Medal of Honor, but are entirely separate awards with different criteria for issuance:

* [[Cardenas Medal of Honor]]: decoration of the [[Revenue Cutter Service]], merged into the [[United States Coast Guard]]

* [[Chaplain's Medal for Heroism]]: awarded posthumously for a single action to [[Four Chaplains|four recipients]]

* [[Congressional Gold Medal]]: the highest civilian honor bestowed by the United States (along with the Presidential Medal of Freedom)

* [[Congressional Space Medal of Honor]]: intended for issuance to astronauts, but despite its name, it is not equal to the Medal of Honor

* [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]]: the highest civilian honor bestowed by the United States (along with the Congressional Gold Medal)

* The [[Southern Cross of Honor]]: a military decoration meant to honor the officers, noncommissioned officers, and privates of the [[Confederate States of America]] for their valor in the armed forces during the [[American Civil War]]. It was formally approved by the [[Congress of the Confederate States]] on October 13, 1862,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.jmu.edu/special/manuscripts/2060_UDC_CrossofHonor.aspx |title=A Guide to the United Daughters of the Confederacy Southern Cross of Honor Documents |publisher=James Madison University Libraries |accessdate=January 26, 2012}}</ref> and was originally intended to be on par with the Union Army's Medal of Honor.

Several [[United States law enforcement decorations]] bear the name "Medal of Honor". The [[Public Safety Officer Medal of Valor]], established by Congress in 2001, stated to be "the highest National award for valor by a public safety officer", is also awarded by the President of the US.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.medalofvalor.gov/ |title=Public Safety Officer Medal of Valor
