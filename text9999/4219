He is particularly known for his leading role in the establishment of a comprehensive project for [[rural development]], [[Comilla Model]] ([[1959]])<ref name="arthur">1973, Arthur F Raper, ''Rural Development in Action: The Comprehensive Experiment at Comilla, East Pakistan'', Cornell University Press: Ithaca</ref> that earned him [[Magsaysay Award]] from [[Philippines]] and honorary [[Doctorate of law|Doctorate of Law]] by [[Michigan State University]]. In [[1980]]s he founded a [[Bottom Up|bottom up]] [[community development]] initiative of [[Orangi Pilot Project]] in [[Karachi]] slums.<ref>2003, Nasim Yousuf, Allama Mashriqi and Dr. Akhtar Hameed Khan: Two Legends of Pakistan, ISBN 1-4010-9097-4</ref> He received wide international recognition and highest honours in Pakistan for these projects and a number of programs that were part of these projects, from microcredit to self-financed and from [[housing]] provision to [[family planning]].

== Personal life ==
Akhtar Hameed Khan was born on [[15 July]] [[1914]] in [[Agra]] and died on [[9 October]] [[1999]]. He graduated from from Agra University in 1934 to joine the [[Indian Civil Service]] (ICS). On his ICS probation, he studied [[literature]] and [[history]] at [[Magdalene College, Cambridge]], [[England]]. A larger part of his ICS career was served in [[East Bengal]]. The [[Bengal famine of 1943]] and subsequent inadequate handling of the situation by the colonial rulers led him to resign from the Indian Civil Service. For two years he worked in a [[village]] near [[Aligarh]] as a [[labourer]] and [[locksmith]]. In 1947, he took up a teaching position at the [[Jamia Millia Islamia|Jamia Millia, Delhi]], and worked for three years.

He spent a significat part of his life in [[Comilla]]. His residence was located in the Ranir Dighir Par area of the town, adjacent to Victoria College where he taught for a long time. As a gesture of respect for his contributions to the community, the Comilla-Kotbari road in [[Bangladesh]] has been named after him.

== Career ==
After [[Partition of Bengal (1947)|Partition of Bengal]] ([[Partition of British India]]) in [[1947]], Akhtar Hameed Khan migrated to [[Karachi]] and from there he went to [[East Pakistan]] to become the Principal of the Comilla Victoria College till [[1958]]. During this time, he developed special interest in the initiatives and participation of grassroots level people. In 1958, he went to the Michigan State University for a special orientation in rural development. Returning in [[1959]], he established Pakistan Academy for Rural Development at [[Comilla]], later renamed as [[Bangladesh Academy for Rural Development]] (BARD). He worked there until [[1971]] as the Director. His ''[[Comilla Model|Comilla project]]'' for rural development and cooperatives became famous as a successful model of local innovative action. In 1963, he received [[Magsaysay Award]] by the Governemnt of the [[Philippines]] for his services in rural development. In 1964, he was awarded an honorary [[Doctorate of law|Doctorate of Law]] by Michigan State University. 

After [[Partition of Pakistan]], when East Pakistan became Bangladesh, Khan moved to Pakistan and served as a Research Fellow, first at the [[University of Agriculture, Faisalabad]], and then in 1972-1973 at [[Karachi University]]. In [[1973]], he went back to the Michigan State University as a visiting professor to remain there until 1979. In 1979 he also began serving as an adviser at the Rural Development Academy at [[Bogra]] in northern Bangladesh. 

Dr Khan also worked as a visiting professor at the [[Lund University]], [[Sweden]], at the [[Woodrow Wilson School]], [[Princeton University]], at [[Harvard University]], and [[Oxford University]].

Retrieved on [[15 February]], [[2007]]</ref> He wrote a number of articles, reports and monographs, mostly relating to rural development in general and his various successful and model initiatives in particular.

== Pioneer of Microcredit and Microfinance ==
Dr. Akhtar Hameed Khan is among the pioneers to have introduced the revolutionary idea of ''microcredit'' and ''microfinance'', for the destitute and the deprived communities. Two of his most successful projects are still privileged as models across the [[developing world]]:

=== Comilla Cooperative Pilot Project ===
{{Main|Comilla Model}}
The [[Comilla Model]] (1959) was Dr Khan's initiative in response to the failure of ''Village Agricultural and Industrial Development'' (V-AID) programme that was launched in [[1953]] in East and West Pakistan with technical assistance from the US government. The V-AID was a governmental level attempt to promote citizens participation in the sphere of [[rural development]].<ref>1983, The Works of Akhtar Hameed Khan. Volume I-III. ''Compiled by the Bandladesh Academy for Rural Development: Kothbari, Comilla''</ref>

Comilla Model provided a methodology of implementation in the areas of agricultural and [[rural]] development on the principle of grassroots level cooperative participation by the people. <ref name="arthur" /> The initial concept was to provide a development model of programmes and institutions that could be replicated across the country. The leadership skills of Khan proved a source of inspiration for [[Grameen Bank]] by one of the Comilla Academy students [[Muhammad Younus]].<ref>2005, E. H. Valsan, [http://adb.org/Documents/Books/Role-of-Public-Administration/session1.pdf Leadership in Public Administration for Alleviating Poverty and Development: A Conceptual Approach], p.49, in Jak Jabes (ed.) The Role of Public Administration in Alleviating Poverty and Improving Governance, NAPSIPAG, Asian Development Bank. ISBN 971-561-593-3</ref>


=== Orangi Pilot Project ===
{{Main|Orangi Pilot Project}}
Orangi poverty alleviation project ([[Orangi Pilot Project]], OPP) was initiated by Dr Khan in 1980. [[Orangi]] at that time was the largest [[squatter]] community (''katchi abadi'') in [[Karachi]].<ref>1999, Arif Hasan, Akhtar Hameed Khan and the Orangi Pilot Project. City Press: Karachi</ref> The project was aimed at socio-economic development of the population of the vast Orangi area of Karachi<ref>1997, George H. Axinn, Agriculture and Human Values, Vol. 14, No. 2, (June). ISSN 0889-048X</ref>. As the project director Dr Khan and proved to be its dynamic and innovative leader.<ref>1998, Ashok Nigam and Sadig Rasheed, [http://www.unicef.org/evaldatabase/Global_1999_Financing_of_Fresh_Water.pdf Financing of Fresh Water for All: A Rights Based Approach], UNICEF Staff Working Papers. Evaluation, Policy and Planning Series, No. EPP-EVL-98-003</ref> The project comprised a number of programs, including a people's financed and managed Low-Cost [[Sanitation]] Program;<ref>1997, Akhter Hameed Khan, The sanitation gap: Development's deadly menace. The Progress of Nations. UNICEF</ref> a [[Housing]] Program; a [[List of basic health topics|Basic Health]] and [[Family Planning]] Program; a Program of [[Microcredit|Supervised Credit]] for Small Family Enterprise Units; an [[education]] Program; and a [[Rural development]] Program in the nearby villages.<ref>1996, Orangi Pilot Project: Reflection and Reminiscences. The Oxford University Press: Karachi</ref>

Comparing the [[Orangi Pilot Project|OPP]] with Comilla project, Akhtar Hameed Khan once commented: 
:''"The Orangi Pilot Project was very different from the Comilla Academy. OPP was a private body, dependent for its small fixed budget on another NGO. The vast resources and support of the government, Harvard advisors, MSU, and Ford Foundation was missing. OPP possessed no authority, no sanctions. It may observe and investigate but it could only advise, not enforce."'' <ref>[http://www.pakistan.gov.pk/divisions/lgrd-division/media/ncrd/intro.html Introduction about Late Dr Akhtar Hameed Khan] at [[Government of Pakistan]] website. Retrieved on [[15 February]], [[2007]]</ref> 

However, both the projects followed the same research and extension methods.
