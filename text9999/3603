==Etymology and pronunciation==
The Neanderthal is named after the [[Neandertal]] valley, originally spelled ''Neanderthal'', which is located about {{convert|12|km|mi|abbr=on}} east of [[D<U+00FC>sseldorf]]. The spelling of the [[German language|German]] word ''Thal'' ("valley"), was changed to ''Tal'' in 1901, and the spelling of the valley was also changed accordingly to ''Neandertal''. The former spelling is however often retained in [[English language|English]] for the hominid. The spelling with ''th'' is in addition always used in [[scientific name]]s throughout the world. In German, the modern spelling with ''t'' is however otherwise used in referring both to the hominid and the valley.

The valley was named after the theologian [[Joachim Neander]], who lived nearby in [[D<U+00FC>sseldorf]] in the late 17th century. "Neander" is a classicized form of the common German surname Neumann. In turn, the hominid was named after the valley, where the first Neanderthal remains were found. The term ''Neanderthal Man'' was coined in 1863 by the [[Anglo-Irish]] [[geologist]] [[William King (geologist)|William King]].

The [[German phonology|German pronunciation]] (regardless of spelling) is with the sound /t/. American English speakers commonly pronounce it as /<U+03B8>/ (''th'' as in ''thin''), but American scientists usually use /t/. British English speakers usually pronounce it as /t/ followed by a long ''a'' as in ''tar''.<ref name=UKandUSpron/><ref>{{cite book |title=The Oxford Illustrated Dictionary |page=564 |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1976 |origyear=1975 |location=Great Britain |quote=(tahl)}}</ref>

==Classification==
[[File:Neanderthaler Fund.png|thumb|right|First reconstruction of Neanderthal man]]
For some time, scientists have debated whether Neanderthals should be classified as ''Homo neanderthalensis'' or as ''Homo sapiens neanderthalensis'', the latter placing Neanderthals as a [[subspecies]] of ''[[Homo sapiens]]''. Some morphological studies support that ''Homo neanderthalensis'' is a separate species and not a subspecies.<ref name=Harvati>{{cite journal |author=Harvati K, Frost SR, McNulty KP |title=Neanderthal taxonomy reconsidered: implications of 3D primate models of intra- and interspecific differences |journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]] |volume=101 |issue=5 |pages=1147<U+2013>52 |year=2004 |month=February |pmid=14745010 |pmc=337021 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0308085100 |url= |accessdate={{Date|2009-05-16|mdy}}}}</ref> Others, for example [[University of Cambridge]] Professor [[Paul Mellars]], say "no evidence has been found of cultural interaction"<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200509/s1450949.htm |title=Modern humans, Neanderthals shared earth for 1,000 years |date={{Date|2005-09-01|mdy}} |accessdate={{Date|2006-09-19|mdy}} |publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)]]}}</ref> and evidence from [[mitochondrial DNA]] studies have been interpreted as evidence [[Evolution of Homo sapiens#H. neanderthalensis|Neanderthal]]s were not a subspecies of ''H. sapiens''.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hedges SB |title=Human evolution.

Neanderthals evolved from African apes along a path similar to humans. Sometime between 5 and 10 million years ago a common ancestral species between chimps and humans lived in Africa. The ancestor evolved along a path that might include [[Ardipithecus#Ardipithecus_kadabba|''Ardipithecus kadabba'']], [[Ardipithecus#Ardipithecus_ramidus|''Ardipithicus ramidus'']], ''[[Australopithecus anamensis]]'', ''[[Australopithecus afarensis]]'', ''[[Homo habilis]]'', ''[[Homo ergaster]]'' (or ''[[Homo erectus]]''). The last common ancestor between anatomically modern ''Homo sapiens'' and Neanderthals appears to be an African variant of ''Homo heidelbergensis'' known as ''[[Homo rhodesiensis]]'', named after a Archaic ''Homo sapiens'', Broken hill 1 ([[Kabwe cranium|Kabwe 1]]) discovered in the territory of [[Northern Rhodesia|Rhodesia]] in 1921. ''Homo rhodesiensis'' arose in Africa an estimated 0.7 to 1 million years ago. The earliest estimates for ''Homo rhodesiensis'' reaching Europe are approximately 800 thousand years ago when a type of human referred to as ''[[Homo antecessor]]'' or ''[[Homo cepranensis]]''. These two human types maybe  forerunners to European ''Homo heidelbergensis'', however stone tools dating from 1.2 to 1.56 million years ago of an unknown creator have been discovered in Southwestern Europe. The evidence at the [[Sima de los Huesos]] (in the Atapuerca cave system on the Iberia peninsula) suggest that ''Homo heidelbergensis'' was already in Europe by 600,000 years ago. The molecular phylogenetics suggest that ''Homo rhodesiensis'' and ''Homo heidelbergensis'' continued to intermix until 350,000 years ago, after which they were separate species and sometime within the last 200,000 years ''Homo heidelbergensis'' evolved into ''Homo neanderthalensis'', the classic Neanderthal man.

==Discovery==
[[File:Neanderthal excavation site.JPG|thumb|left|The site of [[Kleine Feldhofer Grotte]] where the first Neanderthal was unearthed by miners in the nineteenth century]]
[[File:Neanderthal position.png|thumb|upright|right|Location of [[Neander Valley]], Germany. (The highlighted area is the modern federal state of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]].)]]
[[Craniometry|Neanderthal skulls]] were first discovered in [[Engis]], [[Belgium]] (1829) by [[Philippe-Charles Schmerling]] and in [[Forbes' Quarry]], [[Gibraltar]] (1848), both prior to the "original" discovery in a [[limestone]] quarry of the [[Neanderthal, Germany|Neander Valley]] in [[Erkrath]] near [[D<U+00FC>sseldorf]] in August, 1856, three years before [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' was published.<ref>{{cite web |title=Homo neanderthalensis |url=http://anthropology.si.edu/humanorigins/ha/neand.htm |publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]] |accessdate={{Date|2009-05-18|mdy}}}}</ref>

The [[type specimen]], dubbed [[Neanderthal 1]], consisted of a skull cap, two [[femur|femora]], three bones from the right arm, two from the left arm, part of the left [[pelvis|ilium]], fragments of a [[scapula]], and ribs. The workers who recovered this material originally thought it to be the remains of a [[bear]]. They gave the material to amateur naturalist [[Johann Carl Fuhlrott]], who turned the fossils over to anatomist [[Hermann Schaaffhausen]]. The discovery was jointly announced in 1857.

The original Neanderthal discovery is now considered the beginning of [[paleoanthropology]]. These and other discoveries led to the idea that these remains were from ancient [[Europe]]ans who had played an important role in modern [[human evolution|human origins]]. The bones of over 400 Neanderthals have been found since.

==Specimens==
{{Main|List of human evolution fossils}}
[[File:Ferrassie skull.jpg|thumb|The Ferrassie skull]]
* [[La Ferrassie 1]]: A fossilized skull discovered in La Ferrassie, France by R. Capitan in 1909. It is estimated to be 70,000 years old. Its characteristics include a large occipital bun, low-vaulted cranium and heavily worn teeth.
* [[Shanidar 1]]: Found in the Zagros Mountains in northern Iraq; a total of nine skeletons found believed to have lived in the [[Middle Paleolithic]]. One of the nine remains was missing part of its right arm; theorized to have been broken off or [[amputation|amputated]]. The find is also significant because it shows that stone tools were present among this tribe's culture. One was buried with flowers, showing that some type of burial ceremony may have occurred.
* [[La Chapelle-aux-Saints 1]]: Called the Old Man, a fossilized skull discovered in [[La Chapelle-aux-Saints]], France by A. and J. Bouyssonie, and L. Bardon in 1908. Characteristics include a low vaulted cranium and large browridge typical of Neanderthals. Estimated to be about 60,000 years old, the specimen was severely arthritic and had lost all his teeth, with evidence of healing. For him to have lived on would have required that someone process his food for him, one of the earliest examples of Neanderthal altruism (similar to Shanidar I.)
* [[Le Moustier]]: A fossilized skull, discovered in 1909, at the archaeological site in Peyzac-le-Moustier, Dordogne, France. The Mousterian tool culture is named after Le Moustier. The skull, estimated to be less than 45,000 years old, includes a large nasal cavity and a somewhat less developed brow ridge and occipital bun as might be expected in a juvenile.
[[File:Neandertal 1856.jpg|thumb|right|Type Specimen, Neanderthal 1.]]
* [[Neanderthal 1]]: Initial Neanderthal specimen found during an archaeological dig in August 1856. Discovered in a limestone quarry at the Feldhofer grotto in Neanderthal, Germany. The find consisted of a skull cap, two femora, the three right arm bones, two of the left arm bones, ilium, and fragments of a scapula and ribs.

==Habitat and range==
[[File:Carte Neandertaliens.jpg|thumb|left|Sites where typical Neanderthal fossils have been found.]]
Early Neanderthals lived in the Last Glacial age for a span of about 100,000 years. Because of the damaging effects which the glacial period had on the Neanderthal sites, not much is known about the early species. Countries where their remains are known include [[Portugal]], [[Ukraine]], [[Gibraltar]], [[France]],<ref>{{cite news |first=Norman |last=Hammond |date={{Date|2005-09-01|mdy}} |title=Neanderthals and modern man shared a cave |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/court_and_social/article561030.ece |work=[[The Times]] |accessdate={{Date|2009-05-18|mdy}}}}</ref> [[Spain]], [[Great Britain|Britain]],<ref name=dargie2007p9/> [[Germany]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Slovakia]], [[Croatia]], [[Greece]],<ref>{{cite press release |title=Ancient tooth provides evidence of Neanderthal movement |publisher=[[Durham University]] |date={{Date|2008-02-11|mdy}} |url=http://www.dur.ac.uk/news/newsitem/?itemno=6163 |accessdate={{Date|2009-05-18|mdy}}}}</ref> [[Iraq]], [[Israel]], [[Iran]], [[Romania]] and [[Russia]].

Classic Neanderthal fossils have been found over a large area, from northern Germany to Israel and Mediterranean countries like Spain and Italy in the south and from England and Portugal in the west to [[Uzbekistan]] in the east. This area probably was not occupied all at the same time; the northern border of their range in particular would have contracted frequently with the onset of cold periods. On the other hand, the northern border of their range as represented by fossils may not be the real northern border of the area they occupied, since Middle-Palaeolithic looking artifacts have been found even further north, up to 60<U+00B0> on the Russian plain.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Pavlov P, Roebroeks W, Svendsen JI |title=The Pleistocene colonization of northeastern Europe: a report on recent research |journal=Journal of Human Evolution |volume=47 |issue=1-2 |pages=3<U+2013>17 |year=2004 |pmid=15288521 |doi=10.1016/j.jhevol.2004.05.002 |url= |accessdate={{Date|2009-05-18|mdy}}}}</ref> Recent evidence has extended the Neanderthal range by about {{convert|1250|mi|km}} east into southern [[Siberia]]'s [[Altay Mountains]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Nicholas |last=Wade |authorlink=Nicholas Wade |date={{Date|2007-10-02|mdy}} |title=Fossil DNA Expands Neanderthal Range |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/02/science/02nean.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate={{Date|2009-05-18|mdy}}}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Kate |last=Ravilious |date={{Date|2007-10-01|mdy}} |title=Neandertals Ranged Much Farther East Than Thought |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/10/070930-neanderthals.html |publisher=[[National Geographic Society]] |accessdate={{Date|2009-05-18|mdy}}}}</ref>

==Anatomy==

[[File:Neanderthal cranial anatomy.jpg|thumb|right|Neanderthal cranial anatomy.]]
Neanderthals were generally only {{Convert|12|<U+2013>|14|cm|0|abbr=on}} shorter than modern humans, contrary to a common view of them as "very short" or "just over 5 feet". Based on 45 long bones from (at most) 14 males and 7 females, Neanderthal males averaged {{Convert|164|<U+2013>|168|cm|0|abbr=on}} and females {{Convert|152|<U+2013>|156|cm|0|abbr=on}} tall. Compared to Europeans some 20,000 years ago, it is nearly identical, perhaps slightly taller. Considering the body build of Neanderthals, new body weight estimates show they are only slightly above the cm/weight or the [[body mass index]] of modern Americans or Canadians.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Helmuth H |title=Body height, body mass and surface area of the Neanderthals |journal=Zeitschrift F<U+00FC>r Morphologie Und Anthropologie |volume=82 |issue=1 |pages=1<U+2013>12 |year=1998 |pmid=9850627 |doi= |url= |accessdate={{Date|2009-05-16|mdy}}}}</ref>

Neanderthals had more [[robust]] build and distinctive [[Comparative anatomy|morphological]] features, especially of the [[skull|cranium]], which gradually accumulated more derived aspects, particularly in certain relatively isolated geographic regions. Evidence suggests they were much stronger than modern humans;<ref>{{cite web |title=Neanderthal |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/wildfacts/factfiles/459.shtml |publisher=BBC |accessdate={{Date|2009-05-18|mdy}}}}</ref> their relatively robust stature is thought to be an adaptation to the cold climate of Europe during the [[Pleistocene]] epoch.

The magnitude of [[autapomorphy|autapomorphic]] traits in specimens differ in time. In the latest specimens, autapomorphy is fuzzy. The following is a list of physical traits which distinguish Neanderthals from modern humans; however, not all of them can be used to distinguish specific Neanderthal populations, from various geographic areas or periods of evolution, from other extinct humans. Also, many of these traits occasionally manifest in modern humans, particularly among certain ethnic groups traced to Neanderthal habitat ranges. Nothing is certain (from unearthed bones) about the shape of soft parts such as eyes, ears, and lips of Neanderthals.<ref>{{cite news |first=Bjorn |last=Carey |date={{Date|2005-03-10|mdy}} |url=http://www.livescience.com/history/050310_neanderthal_reconstruction.html |title=Scientists Build 'Frankenstein' Neanderthal Skeleton |publisher=[[LiveScience]] |accessdate={{Date|2009-05-18|mdy}}}}</ref>

When comparing traits to worldwide average present day human traits in Neanderthal specimens, the following traits are distinguished. The magnitude on particular trait changes with 300,000 years timeline. The large number of classic Neanderthal traits is significant because 
extreme examples of ''Homo sapiens'' may sometimes show one or more of these traits, but not most or all of them.

===Pathology===
Within the west Asian and European record there are five broad groups of pathology or injury noted in Neanderthal skeletons.

====Fractures====
Neanderthals seemed to suffer a high frequency of fractures, especially common on the ribs ([[Shanidar]] IV, [[La Chapelle-aux-Saints 1]] <U+2018>Old Man<U+2019>), the femur ([[La Ferrassie]] 1), fibulae (La Ferrassie 2 and [[Tabun, Israel|Tabun]] 1), spine ([[Kebara Cave|Kebara]] 2) and skull (Shanidar I, [[Krapina]], [[Sala]] 1). These fractures are often healed and show little or no sign of infection, suggesting that injured individuals were cared for during times of incapacitation. The pattern of fractures, along with the absence of throwing weapons, suggests that they may have hunted by leaping onto their prey and stabbing or even wrestling it to the ground.<ref>{{cite journal|author = T.D. Berger and E. Trinkaus|title = Patterns of trauma among Neadertals|journal = Journal of Archaeological Science|volume = 22|year=  1995|pages = 841<U+2013>852|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6WH8-4FRCV9P-F&_user=994540&_coverDate=11%2F30%2F1995&_fmt=full&_orig=search&_cdi=6844&view=c&_acct=C000050024&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=994540&md5=a958d2c59d5c6d934e9844f46f275e0e&ref=full|accessdate = 2007-06-28 | doi = 10.1016/0305-4403(95)90013-6}}</ref>

====Trauma====
Particularly related to fractures are cases of trauma seen on many skeletons of Neanderthals. These usually take the form of stab wounds, as seen on [[Shanidar|Shanidar III]], whose lung was probably punctured by a stab wound to the chest between the 8th and 9th ribs. This may have been an intentional attack or merely a hunting accident; either way the man survived for some weeks after his injury before being killed by a rock fall in the [[Shanidar|Shanidar cave]]. Other signs of trauma include blows to the head (Shanidar I and IV, Krapina), all of which seemed to have healed, although traces of the scalp wounds are visible on the surface of the skulls.

====Degenerative disease====
Arthritis is particularly common in the older Neanderthal population, specifically targeting areas of articulation such as the ankle (Shanidar III), spine and hips (La Chapelle-aux-Saints <U+2018>Old Man<U+2019>), arms ([[La Quina]] 5, Krapina, [[Feldhofer]]) knees, fingers and toes. This is closely related to [[degenerative joint disease]], which can range from normal, use-related degeneration to painful, debilitating restriction of movement and deformity and is seen in varying degree in the Shanidar skeletons (I<U+2013>IV).

====Hypoplastic disease====
Dental enamel [[hypoplasia]] is an indicator of stress during the development of teeth and records in the striations and grooves in the enamel periods of food scarcity, trauma or disease. A study of 669 Neanderthal dental crowns showed that 75% of individuals suffered some degree of hypoplasia and that nutritional deficiencies were the main cause of hypoplasia and eventual tooth loss. All particularly aged skeletons show evidence of hypoplasia and it is especially evident in the Old Man of La Chapelle-aux-Saints and La Ferrassie 1 teeth.

====Infection====
Evidence of infections on Neanderthal skeletons is usually visible in the form of lesions on the bone, which are created by systematic infection on areas closest to the bone. Shanidar I has evidence of the degenerative lesions as does La Ferrassie 1, whose lesions on both femora, tibiae and fibulae are indicative of a systemic infection or carcinoma (malignant tumour/cancer).

===Childhood===

Neanderthal children might have grown faster than modern human children.

The hyoid is a small bone which connects the musculature of the [[tongue]] and the [[larynx]], and by bracing these structures against each other, allows a wider range of tongue and laryngeal movements than would otherwise be possible. The presence of this bone implies that speech was anatomically possible. The bone which was found is virtually identical to that of modern humans.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Arensburg B, Tillier AM, Vandermeersch B, Duday H, Schepartz LA, Rak Y |title=A Middle Palaeolithic human hyoid bone |journal=Nature |volume=338 |issue=6218 |pages=758<U+2013>60 |year=1989 |month=April |pmid=2716823 |doi=10.1038/338758a0 |url= |accessdate={{Date|2009-05-18|mdy}}}}</ref>

The morphology of the outer and middle ear of Neanderthal ancestors, ''[[Homo heidelbergensis]]'', found in Spain, suggests they had an auditory sensitivity similar to modern humans and very different from chimpanzees. They were probably able to differentiate between many different sounds.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Mart<U+00ED>nez I, Rosa M, Arsuaga JL, Jarabo P, Quam R, Lorenzo C, Gracia A, Carretero JM, Berm<U+00FA>dez de Castro JM, Carbonell E |title=Auditory capacities in Middle Pleistocene humans from the Sierra de Atapuerca in Spain |journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]] |volume=101 |issue=27 |pages=9976<U+2013>81 |year=2004 |month=July |pmid=15213327 |pmc=454200 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0403595101 |url= |accessdate={{Date|2009-05-17|mdy}}}}</ref>

Neurological evidence for potential speech in ''neanderthalensis'' exists in the form of the [[hypoglossal canal]]. The canal of ''neanderthalensis'' is the same size or larger than in modern humans, which are significantly larger than the canal of [[australopithecine]]s and modern [[chimpanzees]]. The canal carries the hypoglossal nerve, which controls the muscles of the tongue. This indicates that ''neanderthalensis'' had vocal capabilities similar to modern humans.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kay RF, Cartmill M, Balow M |title=The hypoglossal canal and the origin of human vocal behavior |journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]] |volume=95 |issue=9 |pages=5417<U+2013>9 |year=1998 |month=April |pmid=9560291 |pmc=20276 |doi=10.1073/pnas.95.9.5417 |url= |accessdate={{Date|2009-05-17|mdy}}}}</ref> A research team from the [[University of California, Berkeley]], led by David DeGusta, suggests that the size of the hypoglossal canal is not an indicator of speech.

Another anatomical difference between Neanderthals and modern humans is their lack of a [[mental protuberance]] (the point at the tip of the chin). This may be relevant to speech as the [[mentalis]] muscle contributes to moving the lower lip and is used to voice a [[bilabial click]]. While some Neanderthal individuals do possess a mental protuberance, their chins never show the inverted T-shape of modern humans.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Jeffrey Schwartz, Ian Tattersall |year=2000  |month=May |title=The human chin revisited: What is it, and who has it? |journal=[[Journal of Human Evolution]] |volume=38 |pages=367<U+2013>409 |doi=10.1006/jhev.1999.0339}}</ref> In contrast, some Neanderthal individuals show inferior lateral mental tubercles (little bumps at the side of the chin).

A recent extraction of DNA from Neanderthal bones indicates that Neanderthals had the same version of the [[FOXP2]] gene as modern humans. This gene is known to play a role in human language.<ref>{{cite news |first=Nicholas |last=Wade |authorlink=Nicholas Wade |date={{Date|2007-10-19|mdy}} |title=Neanderthals Had Important Speech Gene, DNA Evidence Shows |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/19/science/19speech-web.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate={{Date|2009-05-18|mdy}}}}</ref>

[[Steven Mithen]] (2006) proposes that the Neanderthals had an elaborate [[proto-linguistics|proto-linguistic]] system of communication which was more [[origin of music|musical]] than modern human language, and which predated the separation of [[language]] and [[music]] into two separate modes of cognition.<ref>{{cite book |first=Steven J. |last=Mithen |title=The singing neanderthals: the origins of music, language, mind, and body |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] |location=[[Cambridge]] |year=2006 |pages= |isbn=0-674-02192-4 |oclc=62090869}}{{pn}}</ref>

==Tools==
Neanderthal and [[Middle Paleolithic]] archaeological sites show a smaller and different toolkit than those which have been found in [[Upper Paleolithic]] sites, which were perhaps occupied by modern humans which superseded them. Fossil evidence indicating who may have made the tools found in Early Upper Paleolithic sites is still missing.

Neanderthals are thought to have used tools of the Mousterian class, which were often produced using soft hammer percussion, with hammers made of materials like bones, antlers, and wood, rather than hard hammer percussion, using stone hammers. A result of this is that their bone industry was relatively simple. However, there is good evidence that they routinely constructed a variety of stone implements. Neanderthal ([[Mousterian]]) tools most often consisted of sophisticated [[lithic flake|stone-flakes]], task-specific [[hand axe]]s, and [[spear]]s. Many of these tools were very sharp. There is also good evidence that they used a lot of wood, objects which are unlikely to have been preserved until today.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Paul |last=Pettitt |month=February |year=2000 |title=Odd man out: Neanderthals and modern humans |url=http://www.britarch.ac.uk/ba/ba51/ba51feat.html |journal=British Archeology |volume=51 |issn=1357-4442 |accessdate={{Date|2009-05-18|mdy}}}}</ref>

Also, while they had [[weapon]]s, whether they had implements which were used as [[projectile]] weapons is controversial. They had [[spear]]s, made of long wooden shafts with spearheads firmly attached, but they are thought by some to have been thrusting spears.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Steven E. |last=Churchill |year=2002 |title=Of assegais and bayonets: Reconstructing prehistoric spear use |journal=Evolutionary Anthropology |volume=11 |issue=5 |pages=185<U+2013>186 |doi=10.1002/evan.10027}}</ref> Still, a [[Levallois technique|Levallois]] point embedded in a vertebra shows an angle of impact suggesting that it entered by a "parabolic trajectory" suggesting that it was the tip of a projectile.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Eric |last=Bo<U+00EB>da |coauthors=J.

These are thought to have been made by the Neanderthal's ancestors, ''[[Homo erectus]]'' or ''[[Homo heidelbergensis]]''. Generally, projectile weapons are more commonly associated with ''H. sapiens''. The lack of projectile weaponry is an indication of different sustenance methods, rather than inferior technology or abilities. The situation is identical to that of native New Zealand [[M<U+0101>ori]]&nbsp;<U+2014> modern ''Homo sapiens'', who also rarely threw objects, but used spears and clubs instead.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Schwimmer |first=E.

Although much has been made of the Neanderthals' [[burial]] of their dead, their burials were less elaborate than those of anatomically modern humans. The interpretation of the [[Shanidar]] IV burials as including flowers, and therefore being a form of [[ritual]] burial,<ref>{{cite journal |first=Ralph S. |last=Solecki |month=November |year=1975 |title=Shanidar IV, a Neanderthal Flower Burial in Northern Iraq |journal =[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=190 |issue=4217 |pages=880<U+2013>881 |id={{Bibcode|1975Sci...190..880S}}}}</ref> has been questioned.<ref>{{cite journal |first=J. D. |last=Sommer |year=1999 |title=The Shanidar IV 'Flower Burial': a Re-evaluation of Neanderthal Burial Ritual |journal=Cambridge Archaeological Journal |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=127<U+2013>129 |issn=0959-7743}}</ref> On the other hand, five of the six flower pollens found with Shanidar IV are known to have had 'traditional' medical uses, even among relatively recent 'modern' populations. In some cases Neanderthal burials include [[grave goods]], such as [[wisent|bison]] and [[aurochs]] bones, tools, and the [[pigment]] [[ochre]].

Neanderthals also performed many sophisticated tasks which are normally associated only with humans. For example, it is known that they controlled fire, constructed complex shelters, and skinned animals. A trap excavated at [[La Cotte de St Brelade]] in [[Jersey]] gives testament to their intelligence and success as hunters.<ref name=dargie2007p9>{{cite book |title=A History of Britain |first=Richard |last=Dargie |year=2007 |page=9 |oclc=124962416 |isbn=9780572033422 |publisher=Arcturus |location=London}}</ref>

Particularly intriguing is a hollowed-out bear [[femur]] with holes which may have been deliberately bored into it, known as the [[Divje Babe flute]]. This bone was found in western [[Slovenia]] in 1995, near a Mousterian fireplace, but its significance is still a matter of dispute. Some paleoanthropologists have hypothesized that it was a musical instrument, while others believe it was created by accident through the chomping action of another bear.

Pendants and other jewelry showing traces of ochre dye and of deliberate grooving have also been found<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kuhn SL, Stiner MC, Reese DS, G<U+00FC>le<U+00E7> E |title=Ornaments of the earliest Upper Paleolithic: new insights from the Levant |journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]] |volume=98 |issue=13 |pages=7641<U+2013>6 |year=2001 |month=June |pmid=11390976 |pmc=34721 |doi=10.1073/pnas.121590798 |url= |accessdate={{Date|2009-05-18|mdy}}}}</ref> with later finds, particularly in France but whether or not they were created by Neanderthals or traded to them by Cro-Magnons is a matter of controversy.

===Cannibalism or ritual defleshing?===
[[File:Neanderthal-burial.gif|thumb|Neanderthal Burial of Kebara Cave (Carmel Range, Israel). Thermoluminescence dates place Neanderthal levels at Kebara at ca. 60,000 BP. Skeleton of an adult man nicknamed Moshe (25<U+2013>35 years old, height 1,70 m) found in 1983]]
Neanderthals hunted large animals, such as the mammoth. Stone-tipped wooden spears were used for hunting and stone knives and poleaxes were used for butchering the animals or as [[weapon]]s. However, they are believed to have practiced cannibalism, or ritual defleshing. This hypothesis has been represented after researchers found marks on Neanderthal bones similar to the bones of a dead deer butchered by Neanderthals.

Intentional burial and the inclusion of grave goods are the most typical representations of ritual behavior in the Neanderthals and denote a developing ideology. However, another much debated and controversial manifestation of this ritual treatment of the dead comes from the evidence of cut-marks on the bone which has 'historically been viewed' as evidence of ritual defleshing.

Neanderthal bones from various sites ([[Combe-Grenal]] and [[Abri Moula]] in [[France]], [[Krapina]] in [[Croatia]] and [[Grotta Guattari]] in [[Italy]]) have all been cited as bearing cut marks made by stone tools.<ref name="livescience">{{cite web |title=Neanderthals Were Cannibals, Study Confirms |url=http://www.livescience.com/humanbiology/061204_neanderthal_lifestyle.html |author=Andrea Thompson |date=2006-12-04 |work=Health SciTech |publisher=LiveScience}}</ref> However, results of technological tests reveal varied causes.

Re-evaluation of these marks using high-powered microscopes, comparisons to contemporary butchered animal remains, and recent ethnographic cases of [[excarnation]] mortuary practises have shown that perhaps this was a case of ritual defleshing.
* At Grotta Guattari, the apparently purposefully widened base of the skull (for access to the brains) has been shown to be caused by carnivore action, with [[hyena]] tooth marks found on the skull and mandible.
* According to some studies, fragments of bones from Krapina show marks which are similar to those seen on bones from secondary burials at a Michigan ossuary (14th century AD) and are indicative of removing the flesh of a partially decomposed body.
* According to others, the marks on the bones found at Krapina are indicative of defleshing, although whether this was for nutritional or ritual purposes cannot be determined with certainty.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Pathou-Mathis M | year = 2000 | title = Neanderthal subsistence behaviours in Europe | journal = International Journal of Osteoarchaeology | volume = 10 | pages = 379<U+2013>395 | doi = 10.1002/1099-1212(200009/10)10:5<379::AID-OA558>3.0.CO;2-4}}</ref>
* Analysis of bones from [[Abri Moula]] in France does seem to suggest cannibalism was practiced here. Cut-marks are concentrated in places expected in the case of butchery, instead of defleshing. Additionally the treatment of the bones was similar to that of roe deer bones, assumed to be food remains, found in the same shelter.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Defleur A, White T, Valensi P, Slimak L, Cregut-Bonnoure E | year = 1999 | title = Neanderthal cannibalism at Moula-Guercy, Ard<U+00E8>che, France | journal = Science | volume = 286 | pages = 128<U+2013>131 | doi = 10.1126/science.286.5437.128 | pmid = 10506562}}</ref>

The evidence indicating cannibalism would not distinguish Neanderthals from modern ''Homo sapiens''. Ancient and existing ''Homo sapiens'' are known to have practiced cannibalism (e.g. the [[Korowai]]) and/or mortuary defleshing (e.g.  the [[sky burial]] of [[Tibet]]).

Grooves in bones are hypothesized to be cuts by Neanderthal tools, not animal teeth. The chances of them being random, as some writers attributing them to animals have proposed, is [[Divje Babe#.22Neanderthal flute.22|debated]].

==Genome==
{{See|Neanderthal Genome Project}}
Previous investigations concentrated on mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which, owing to strictly matrilineal inheritance and subsequent vulnerability to [[genetic drift]], is of limited value to disprove interbreeding of Neanderthals with Cro-Magnon people.

In July 2006, the [[Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology]] and [[454 Life Sciences]] announced that they would be [[sequencing]] the [[Neanderthal genome]] over the next two years. This [[genome]] is very likely to be roughly the size of the [[human genome]], three-billion base pairs, and probably shares most of its [[genes]]. It is thought a comparison will expand understanding of Neanderthals as well as the evolution of humans and human brains.<ref>{{cite news |title=Neanderthal genome project launches |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/13955661/ |date={{Date|2006-07-20|mdy}} |accessdate={{Date|2006-08-22|mdy}} |last=Moulson |first=Geir |coauthors=[[Associated Press]] |publisher=[[MSNBC]]}}</ref>

[[Svante P<U+00E4><U+00E4>bo]] has tested more than 70 Neanderthal specimens and found only one which had enough DNA to sample. Preliminary DNA sequencing from a 38,000-year-old bone fragment of a femur found at Vindija cave, [[Croatia]], in 1980 shows that ''Homo neanderthalensis'' and ''Homo sapiens'' share about 99.5% of their DNA.

With 3 billion nucleotides sequenced, analysis of about 1/3rd shows that there is no sign of admixture between modern humans and Neanderthals, according to P<U+00E4><U+00E4>bo. This concurs with the work of Noonan from two years earlier. The variant of [[Microcephalin]] common outside Africa, which was attributed to rapid brain growth in humans and suggested to be of Neanderthal origin, was not found in Neanderthals. Nor was the [[MAPT]] variant, a very old variant found primarily in Europeans.<ref name="Human genome tales"/>

{{Main|Neanderthal extinction hypotheses}}

===Extinction===
{{See also|Recent African origin of modern humans}}
According to the [[Out of Africa]] theory, modern humans (''[[Homo sapiens]]'') began replacing Neanderthals around 45,000 years ago, as the [[Cro-Magnon]] people appeared in [[Europe]], pushing populations of Neanderthals into regional pockets, such as modern-day [[Croatia]], [[Iberian peninsula|Iberia]], and the [[Crimean peninsula]],{{Clarify|date=January 2008}} where they held on for thousands of years. The last traces of [[Mousterian culture]] (without human specimens) have been found in [[Gorham's Cave]] on the remote south-facing coast of [[Gibraltar]], dated 30,000 to 24,500 years ago.
Proponents of this model believe that modern humans and Neanderthals were separate species that were not interfertile. They cite the following evidence:
*The Neanderthals and modern humans were contemporaneous species. The two species maintained distinct morphologies over hundreds of thousands of years. On a number of occasions the habitats of modern humans and the Neanderthals overlapped. However, despite this overlap, the respective morphologies remained distinct based on the available fossil record.<ref name="tattersall"/>
*For example, remains associated with modern human anatomy have been found at [[Qafzeh]] in Israel dating to 90,000 years ago. These remains predate Neanderthal remains such as those at [[Kebara Cave]], also in Israel, by about 30,000 years. Since Neanderthals appear after modern humans, it is unlikely that these modern humans evolved from the Neanderthals.<ref name="lahr">{{cite book |first=Marta Miraz<U+00F3>n |last=Lahr |chapter=Discussions of Continuity versus Discontinuity |chapterurl=http://books.google.com/books?id=EWc7d22_UMYC&pg=PA38 |title=The evolution of modern human diversity: a study of cranial variation |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |location=[[Cambridge]] |year=1996 |pages=38<U+2013>39 |isbn=0-521-47393-4 |oclc=33131545 |accessdate={{Date|2009-05-18|mdy}}}}</ref>

*The most recent patrilineal ancestor of all living humans (traced ''via'' Y-chromosome inheritance), [[Y-chromosomal Adam]], is estimated to have lived in Africa 60,000 years ago.

Neanderthals, according to Jordan (2001), appear to have had psychological traits that worked well in their early history but placed them at a long term disadvantage with regards to "modern" humans.  They mastered complex tasks such as the making of fire, shelters with post holes, and stone tools.  Yet there were many [[Cro-Magnon]] tools and behaviors the Neanderthals never developed: fish hooks, fish nets, headgear or hats, shoes, sewn clothing, needle-and-thread, and long-distance trade.  It is still debated whether Neanderthals had significant art or music.<ref name = Jordan01>Jordan, P. (2001) ''Neanderthal: Neanderthal Man and the Story of Human Origins.'' The History Press ISBN 978-0750926768.</ref>

Other researchers think that the Neanderthals had little sexual division of labor, with Neanderthal women alongside the men hunting [[big game]].  Such a lifestyle was not as energy efficient as that of "modern" humans, whose hunter-gatherer lifestyle secured supplemental food of a much greater variety, including plant materials, fish, edible fungi, and small edible animals secured by women, young boys and elderly men, while males in the prime of life could hunt big mammals.  Since the Neanderthals were mostly [[carnivorous]] and targeting big mammals, a shortage of large mammals meant possible bouts of starvation or malnutrition, which affected [[Cro-Magnon]] people less. The Neanderthals appear to have never stored food against lean times, and secured it in a haphazard, catch-as-catch-can manner.  

Neanderthals appear to have never used boats or rafts, as evidenced by the lack of Neanderthal fossils from North Africa, yet Homo Erectus, their more primitive ancestor, appears to have used rafts or some other sort of boat on occasion.  Homo Erectus, or some other hominid, used such craft to reach the island of [[Flores]] as evidenced by the discovery of [[Homo floresiensis]].  Flores and some other places Homo Erectus reached have always been surrounded by very deep water, proving the use of watercraft of some sort.<ref name = Jordan01/>

Additionally, Neanderthals evidently had little long term planning when securing food: French caves show almost no salmon bones during Neanderthal occupancy but large numbers during [[Cro-Magnon]] occupancy, showing that the Cro Magnons planned for future salmon runs.  Neanderthals appear to have had little to no social organization beyond the immediate family unit. Why Neanderthal psychology was different from the "modern" people that they coexisted with for millenia is not known.<ref name = Jordan01/> 

Due to the paucity of symbolism that Neanderthal artifacts show, arguably Neanderthal language probably did not deal much with a verbal future tense, again restricting Neanderthal exploitation of resources.  Cro-Magnon people appear to have had a much better standard of living than the hardscrabble existence available to Neanderthals.  All in all, with better language skills and bigger social groups, and with a better psychological repertoire, Cro-Magnon people, living alongside the Neanderthals on the same land, in general outclassed them in terms of life span, available spare time, physical health, comfort, fewer injuries, quality of life, and food procurement.  This set the stage for eventual replacement of the Neanderthal.<ref name = Jordan01/>  

Jordan states that a tool tradition called the Chatelperronian argues that Neanderthals were making some attempts at advancement, as the Chatelperronian tools are only associated with Neanderthal remains. It appears that this tradition was connected to social contact with Cro-Magnons of some sort. There were some items of personal decoration found at these sites, but these are inferior to contemporary Cro-Magnon items of personal decoration and arguably were made more by imitation than by a spirit of original creativity. Yet at the same time, Neanderthal stone tools were sometimes finished well enough to show some esthetic sense. <ref name = Jordan01/>

As Jordan notes:  "A natural sympathy for the underdog and the disadvantaged lends a sad poignancy to the fate of the Neanderthal folk, however it came about."<ref name = Jordan01/>

===Interbreeding hypotheses===
{{See also|Multiregional hypothesis}}
It is possible that Neanderthals and "moderns" could in theory have interbred and produced fertile offspring, but that psychological/behavioural differences prevented sexual attraction between these two human types.{{Or|date=October 2009}}

It is open to debate if successful interbreeding took place.  There is the chance that Neanderthals were different enough from ''Homo sapiens'' that there was little to no sexual contact at all, or if so, that there were no fertile offspring with live offspring being sterile, like [[mules]].  If there was successful breeding with fertile offspring, it is possible that the greater numbers of ''Homo sapiens'' simply drowned out the Neanderthal input or that Neanderthal traits were later "weeded out" of the hybrid population by natural or sexual selection.{{Or|date=October 2009}}

The validity of such an extensive period of cornered Neanderthal groups is recently questioned.{{Clarify|date=October 2009}} There is no longer certainty regarding the identity of the humans who produced the [[Aurignacian]] culture, even though the presumed westward spread of anatomically modern humans (AMHs) across Europe is still based on the controversial first dates of the Aurignacian. Currently, the oldest European anatomically modern ''Homo sapiens'' is represented by a robust modern human mandible discovered at Pestera cu Oase (south-west Romania), dated to 34<U+2013>36 thousand years ago. Human skeletal remains from the German site of Vogelherd, so far regarded the best association between anatomically modern ''Homo sapiens'' and Aurignacian culture, were revealed to represent intrusive [[Neolithic]] burials into the Aurignacian levels and subsequently all the key Vogelherd fossils are now dated to 3.9<U+2013>5.0 thousand years ago instead.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nature02690 |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v430/n6996/full/nature02690.html |year=2004 |month=Jul |author=Conard, Nj; Grootes, Pm; Smith, Fh |title=Unexpectedly recent dates for human remains from Vogelherd. |volume=430 |issue=6996 |pages=198<U+2013>201 |issn=0028-0836 |pmid=15241412 |journal=Nature}}</ref> As for now, the expansion of the first anatomically modern humans into Europe cannot be located by diagnostic and well-dated anatomically modern human fossils "west of the Iron Gates of the Danube" before 32 thousand years ago.<ref name="proceedings17196">{{cite journal |author=Soficaru A, Dobos A, Trinkaus E |title=Early modern humans from the Pestera Muierii, Baia de Fier, Romania |journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]] |volume=103 |issue=46 |pages=17196<U+2013>201 |year=2006 |month=November |pmid=17085588 |pmc=1859909 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0608443103 |url= |accessdate={{Date|2009-05-17|mdy}}}}</ref>

In another study, researchers have recently found in Pestera Muierii, Romania, remains of European humans from 30 thousand years ago who possessed mostly diagnostic "modern" anatomical features, but ''also'' had distinct Neanderthal features not present in ancestral modern humans in Africa, including a large bulge at the back of the skull, a more prominent projection around the elbow joint, and a narrow socket at the shoulder joint. Analysis of one skeleton's shoulder showed that these humans, like Neanderthal, did not have the full capability for throwing spears.<ref name=hayes20061102/>

The paleontological analysis of modern human emergence in Europe has been shifting from considerations of the Neanderthals to assessments of the biology and chronology of the earliest modern humans in western Eurasia. This focus, involving morphologically modern humans before 28,000 years ago, shows accumulating evidence that they present a variable mosaic of derived modern human, archaic human, and Neanderthal features.<ref name="proceedings17196"/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Trinkaus E, Moldovan O, Milota S, B<U+00EE>lg<U+0103>r A, Sarcina L, Athreya S, Bailey SE, Rodrigo R, Mircea G, Higham T, Ramsey CB, van der Plicht J |title=An early modern human from the Pe<U+015F>tera cu Oase, Romania |journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]] |volume=100 |issue=20 |pages=11231<U+2013>6 |year=2003 |month=September |pmid=14504393 |pmc=208740 |doi=10.1073/pnas.2035108100 |url= |accessdate={{Date|2009-05-17|mdy}}}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Trinkaus E |title=European early modern humans and the fate of the Neandertals |journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]] |volume=104 |issue=18 |pages=7367<U+2013>72 |year=2007 |month=May |pmid=17452632 |pmc=1863481 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0702214104 |url= |accessdate={{Date|2009-05-16|mdy}}}}</ref> Studies of fossils from the upper levels of the Sima de las Palomas, [[Murcia]], Spain, dated to 40,000 years ago, establish the late persistence of Neanderthals in Iberia.

{{Main|Neanderthals in popular culture}}

In popular idiom the word neanderthal is sometimes used as an insult, to suggest that a person combines a deficiency of intelligence and an attachment to brute force, as well as perhaps implying the person is old fashioned or attached to outdated ideas, much in the same way as "dinosaur" is also used. Although they are frequently characterized in this manner, research showing Neanderthals were as intelligent as contemporaneous ''Homo sapiens'', with early stone tool technologies of comparable efficiency, is debunking long-held beliefs.<ref>''Science Daily'', [http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/08/080825203924.htm "New Evidence Debunks 'Stupid' Neanderthal Myth"]</ref>

Counterbalancing this are sympathetic literary portrayals of Neanderthals, as in the novel ''[[The Inheritors (William Golding)|The Inheritors]]'' by [[William Golding]], [[Isaac Asimov]]'s ''[[The Ugly Little Boy]]'', and [[Jean M. Auel]]'s ''[[Earth's Children]]'' series, though Auel repeatedly compares Neanderthals to modern humans unfavorably within the series, showing them to be less advanced in nearly every facet of their lives. Instead she gives them access to a 'race memory' and uses it to explain both their cultural richness and eventual stagnation. A more serious treatment is offered by Finnish palaeontologist [[Bj<U+00F6>rn Kurt<U+00E9>n]], in several works including ''[[Dance of the Tiger]]'', and British psychologist [[Stan Gooch]] in his hybrid-origin theory of humans. ''[[The Neanderthal Parallax]]'', a trilogy of science fiction novels dealing with Neanderthals, written by [[Robert J. Sawyer]], explores a scenario where neanderthals are seen as a distinct species from humans and survive in a parallel universe version of earth.  The novels explore what happens when they, having developed a sophisticated technological culture of their own, open a portal to this version of the earth. The three novels are titled ''Hominids'', ''Humans'', and ''Hybrids'', respectively, and together form essentially one story.

In the [[Thursday Next]] series of novels by [[Jasper Fforde]], a small population of Neanderthals were re-created in modern Britain by advanced cloning techniques in the later years of the twentieth century. These fictional Neanderthals have equivalent intelligence to normal humans, but have a radically different culture in which aggression and competition are virtually unthinkable.
