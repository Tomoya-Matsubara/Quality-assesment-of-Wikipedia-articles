'''Women in the Americas''' are women who were born in, who live in, and are from the [[Americas]]. By regional division, these women are the women from [[Women in North America|North America]] and those that are from [[Women in South America|South America]]. Some of these women can also be designated as women in [[Central America]] or women in [[Middle America (region)|Middle America]]. Some women of the Americas come from the [[Carribean]] region. Their evolution, culture and history coincide with the [[History of the Americas|history]] of the [[American continent]] itself.

Some North American women come from [[dependencies and other territories]] such as those women from [[Women in Anguilla|Anguilla]] (United Kingdom), [[Women in Aruba|Aruba]] (Kingdom of the Netherlands), [[Women in Bermuda|Bermuda]] (United Kingdom), [[Women in Bonaire|Bonaire]] (Kingdom of the Netherlands), the [[Women in the British Virgin Islands|British Virgin Islands]] (United Kingdom), [[Women in the Cayman Islands|Cayman Islands]] (United Kingdom), [[Women in Cura<U+00E7>ao|Cura<U+00E7>ao]] (Kingdom of the Netherlands), [[Women in Greenland|Greenland]] ([[Kingdom of Denmark]]), [[Women in Guadeloupe|Guadeloupe]] ([[France]]), [[Women in Martinique|Martinique]] (France), [[Women in Montserrat|Montserrat]] (United Kingdom), [[Women in Puerto Rico|Puerto Rico]] (United States), [[Women in Saint Barth<U+00E9>lemy|Saint Barth<U+00E9>lemy]] (France), [[Women in Saint Martin|Saint Martin]] (France), [[Women in Saint Pierre and Miquelon|Saint Pierre and Miquelon]] (France), [[Women in Saba|Saba]] (Kingdom of the Netherlands), [[Women in Sint Eustatius|Sint Eustatius]] (Kingdom of the Netherlands), [[Women in Sint Maarten|Sint Maarten]] (Kingdom of the Netherlands), [[Women in Turks and Caicos Islands|Turks and Caicos Islands]] (United Kingdom), and the [[Women in the United States Virgin Islands|United States Virgin Islands]] ([[United States]]).

Some South American women come from dependencies and other territories like those that are from [[Women in Aruba|Aruba]] ([[Kingdom of the Netherlands]]), [[Women in Bonaire|Bonaire]] (Kingdom of the Netherlands), [[Women in Cura<U+00E7>ao|Cura<U+00E7>ao]] (Kingdom of the Netherlands), the [[Women in the Falkland Islands|Falkland Islands]] ([[United Kingdom]]), [[Women in French Guiana|French Guiana]] ([[France]]), [[Women in South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands|South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands]] (United Kingdom).

The history of '''Canadian women''' covers half the population, but until recent years only comprised a tiny fraction of the historiography.<ref>See Mona Gleason and Adele Perry, eds. '' Rethinking Canada: The Promise of Women's History.'' (5th ed. 2006)</ref>

In the 1660s the French government sent about 850 young women (single or widowed) called [[King's Daughters]] ("filles du roi"). They quickly found husbands among the predominantly male settlers, as well as a new life for themselves. They came mostly from poor families in the Paris area, Normandy and the central-western regions of France. A handful were ex-prostitutes, but only one is known to have practiced that trade in Canada.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jan Gregoire Coombs|title=Our Tangled French Canadian Roots|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=S-s2maBGnh0C&pg=PA48|accessdate=31 December |page=48}}</ref> As farm wives with very good nutrition and high birth rates they played a major role in establishing family life and enabling rapid demographic growth. They had about 30% more children than comparable women who remained in France.  Landry says, "Canadians had an exceptional diet for their time. This was due to the natural abundance of meat, fish, and pure water; the good food conservation conditions during the winter; and an adequate wheat supply in most years."<ref>Landry, 1993, p. 586 </ref><ref>Yves Landry, "Fertility in France and New France: The Distinguishing Characteristics of Canadian Behavior in the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries," ''Social Science History'' (1993) 17#4  pp. 577-592, quote p 586; [http://www.jstor.org/stable/1171305 in JSTOR]</ref>  The [[History of women in the United States|American]] politician [[Hillary Clinton]] is a descendant of one of them.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

Besides household duties, some women participated in the fur trade, the major source of cash in New France. They worked at home alongside their husbands or fathers as merchants, clerks and provisioners. Some were widowed, and took over their husbands' roles. A handful were active entrepreneurs in their own right.<ref>Jan Noel, "N'<U+00EA>tre plus la d<U+00E9>l<U+00E9>gu<U+00E9>e de personne: une r<U+00E9><U+00E9>valuation du r<U+00F4>le des femmes dans le commerce en Nouvelle-France," ''Revue d'histoire de L'Amerique francaise,'' (2009) 63#2 pp 209-241. </ref>

In the early 19th century down to the 1950s upper-class [[English language|Anglos]] dominated high society in Montreal, and their women constructed and managed their identity and social position through central events in the social life, such as the coming out of debutantes. The elite young women were trained in intelligent philanthropy and civic responsibility, especially through the Junior Leagues. They seldom connected with the reform impulses of the middle class women, and for and were paternalistic in their views of the needs of working-class women.<ref>Elise Chenier, "Class, Gender, and the Social Standard: The Montreal Junior League, 1912<U+2013>1939," ''Canadian Historical Review'' (2009) 90#4 pp 671-710.</ref>

However, the reality in Haiti is quite far from the law: "political, economic and social features of Haiti negatively affect most Haitians, but Haitian women experience additional barriers to the full enjoyment of their basic rights due to predominant social beliefs that they are inferior to men and a historical pattern of discrimination and violence against them based on their sex. Discrimination against women is a structural feature in Haitian society and culture that has subsisted throughout its history, both in times of peace and unrest."<ref>Report of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR)on <U+201C>The Right of Women in Haiti to be Free from Violence and Discrimination.<U+201D> OEA/Ser.L/V/II, Doc. 64, 10 March 2009.</ref>

===Paraguay===
{{Main|Women in Paraguay}}
'''Women in Paraguay''' live in a culture that has been undergoing rapid change in recent decades. Women's rights were expanded through constitutional and legal changes during the 1990s. Cultural attitudes towards many areas of women's lives are also changing. Yet [[Paraguay]]an women still face many challenges in trying to attain social equality.

The legal and government institutions that currently exist in Paraguay were developed in part through the efforts of feminist organizations in the country that held significant awareness-raising campaigns during the 1990s to formalize the guarantees of women's rights.<ref>{{cite web|title=Social Institutions and Gender Index|url=http://genderindex.org/country/paraguay|publisher=http://genderindex.org|accessdate=September 4, 2011}}</ref>

The 1992 Constitution of Paraguay upholds the principle of equality for all individuals and prohibits discrimination.  However, socio-cultural practises still support discrimination against women in some areas.

The [[Government of Peru|Peruvian Government]] has begun efforts to combat the high maternal mortality rate and lack of female political representation, as well as [[violence against women]]. However, the efforts have not yet borne fruit.
