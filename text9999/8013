The '''Syrian Liberation Front''' ({{lang-ar|<U+062C><U+0628><U+0647><U+0629> <U+062A><U+062D><U+0631><U+064A><U+0631> <U+0633><U+0648><U+0631><U+064A><U+0627>}}, Jabha Tahrir Suriya, SLF) or '''Front to Liberate Syria''' is a coalition of [[Islamist]] rebel brigades who are actively fighting against the [[Bashar al-Assad]] government in the [[Syrian civil war]]. As of late 2012, it is one of the most powerful powerful armed groupings in Syria,<ref name=Time>{{cite web|url=http://world.time.com/2012/09/18/syrias-secular-and-islamist-rebels-who-are-the-saudis-and-the-qataris-arming/ |title=Syria<U+2019>s Secular and Islamist Rebels: Who Are the Saudis and the Qataris Arming? |publisher=Time Magazine}}</ref> representing up to half of [[Bashar Assad|Bashar Assad's]] armed opponents.<ref name="reuters111012" />

==Background==
Founded in September 2012 after secret negotiations between the group's leaders, the Front is headed by Ahmed Abu Issa, the leader of the [[Suqour al-Sham Brigade]]. The Front includes around 20 [[Islamist]] groups and has tens of thousands of fighters active through much of Syria, overshadowing the [[Free Syrian Army]] in some regions. While some member groups appear to consider themselves members of both the Front and the FSA,<ref name="fp151012" /> Abu Issa says the Front aims to maintain brotherly relations with the FSA while declining to offer full support and criticising those leaders of the FSA that remain in Turkey. <ref name="reuters111012" />

The Front includes some of the most important rebel units active in the civil war, including [[Suqour al-Sham]] ([[Idlib Governorate|Idlib]] and the [[Farouq Brigades]] ([[Homs Governorate|Homs]]). Other prominent groups in the Front include the Deir Ezzor Revolutionary Council ([[Deir ez-Zor Governorate|Deir ez-Zor]]), Tajamo Ansar al-Islam ([[Damascus Governorate|Damascus]]), Amr Ibn al-Aas Brigade ([[Aleppo Governorate|Aleppo]]), and al-Naser Salaheddin Brigade ([[Latakia Governorate|Latakia]]).<ref name="fp151012" /> These groups are geographically scattered, vary in size and influence, and are dependent on different sources of funding. It is unclear how effectively the Front coordinates between the varying groups or how durable the alliance will be. <ref name="fp151012" />

==Weapons==
Abu Issa says that the Front obtains their weapons from attacks on the [[Syrian Armed Forces]] and from arms dealers inside and outside Syria, however it reportedly receives support from [[Turkey]] and [[Qatar]]<ref name=fp011212>{{cite web|url=http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/10/01/rebels_with_a_cause_but_not_much_consensus?page=full |title=Rebels With a Cause, But Not Much Consensus|publisher=Foreign Policy}}</ref>. It has been accused by members of the [[Free Syrian Army|FSA]] of monopolizing the supply of weapons through Turkey in order to marginalize unaffiliated rebel groups<ref name="fp011212" /><ref name="reuters111012" />.

==Ideology==
The Group was originally called the Islamic Front to Liberate Syria, Brigade leaders voted to drop the word Islamic but the Front has an [[Islamist]] ideology<ref name="reuters111012" />. It includes both [[Muslim Brotherhood]] and [[Salafist]] inspired groups, however many of the more hardline [[Islamist]] groups active in the [[Syrian Civil War]] are members of the [[Syrian Islamic Front]]. The Front excludes the [[Jihadist]] [[Al-Nusra Front]], and [[Ahrar al-Sham]] withdrew from the Front in protest at the killing of a Jihadist leader by one of the member groups<ref name="reuters111012" />. Some in the [[Free Syrian Army]] criticise the Front for it's emphasis on an Islamic identity in a religiously mixed country.<ref name="reuters111012" />

The Front has a minimalist [[political platform]], promising to protect minorities and stating that [[Sharia law]] is the point of reference for the Front.<ref name="fp151012" />
