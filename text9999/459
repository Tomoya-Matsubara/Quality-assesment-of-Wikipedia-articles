The '''Smith Act trials of Communist Party leaders''' were a series of trials held from 1949 to 1958 in which leaders of the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party of the United States]] (CPUSA) were accused of violating the [[Smith Act]], a 1940 statute that set penalties for advocating the violent overthrow of the government. The prosecution argued that the CPUSA's policies promoted violent revolution; the defendants countered that they advocated a peaceful transition to socialism, and that the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]'s guarantee of [[free speech]] and [[Freedom of association|association]] protected their membership in a political party. The trials led to the [[US Supreme Court]] decisions ''[[Dennis v. United States]]'' (1951) and ''[[Yates v. United States]]'' (1957).

The first trial, in 1949, was one of the lengthiest and most contentious trials in American history. The hearing was featured on the cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine twice, and large numbers of supporters of the communist defendants protested outside the courthouse daily. During the trial, the defense frequently antagonized the judge and prosecution, and five of the defendants were sent to jail for [[contempt of court]] because they disrupted the proceedings. The prosecution's case relied on undercover informants who described the goals of the CPUSA, interpreted communist texts, and testified that they believed the CPUSA advocated the violent overthrow of the US&nbsp;government.  

While the first trial was under way, events outside the courtroom influenced public perception of communism: The [[Soviet Union]] tested its first [[nuclear weapon]], and communists prevailed in the [[Chinese Civil War]]. Public opinion was overwhelmingly against the defendants. After a ten-month trial the jury found all eleven defendants guilty and the judge sentenced them to terms of up to five years in federal prison. When the trial concluded, the judge sent all five defense attorneys to jail for contempt of court. Two of the attorneys were subsequently [[Disbarment|disbarred]].

After the first trial, the prosecutors{{spaced ndash}}encouraged by their success{{spaced ndash}}tried over 100 additional CPUSA officers for violating the Smith Act.  Some were tried solely because they were members of the Party. Many of these defendants had difficulty finding attorneys to represent them. The trials decimated the leadership of the CPUSA. In 1957, eight years after the first trial, the US Supreme Court's ''Yates'' decision signaled an end to similar prosecutions, by holding that  defendants could be prosecuted only for their actions, not for their beliefs.

==Background==
[[File:Step by step greene.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A political cartoon showing a person walking down steps from "strikes" to "chaos"|Early fears of [[Bolshevism]] and [[anarchism]] were manifested in the [[First Red Scare]], illustrated by this 1919 political cartoon.]]
{{main|History of the Communist Party USA}}
After the [[Russian revolution|revolution]] in Russia in 1917, communism gradually gained footholds in many countries around the world. In Europe and the US, communist parties were formed, generally allied with trade union and labor causes. During the [[First Red Scare]] of 1919<U+2013>1920, many Americans were fearful that [[Bolshevism]] and [[anarchism]] would lead to disruption within the US.<ref>Murray, Robert K. (1955), ''Red Scare: A Study in National Hysteria, 1919<U+2013>1920'', University of Minnesota Press, ISBN 0313226733.</ref> In the late 1930s, state and federal legislatures passed laws designed to expose communists, including laws requiring loyalty oaths, and laws requiring communists to register with the government.  Even the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU), a free-speech advocacy organization, passed a resolution in 1939 expelling communists from its leadership ranks.<ref>Walker, pp 128<U+2013>133.</ref>

Following Congressional investigation of  left-wing and right-wing extremist political groups in the mid 1930s, support grew for a statutory prohibition of their activities. The alliance of [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union]] in the August 1939 [[Molotov<U+2013>Ribbentrop Pact]] and their invasion of Poland in September gave the movement added impetus. In 1940 the [[United States Congress|Congress]] passed the [[Smith Act]], which required all non-citizen adult residents to register with the government, and made it a crime "to knowingly or willfully advocate ... the duty, necessity, desirability, ...  of overthrowing or destroying any government in the United States by force or violence ... with the intent to cause the overthrow or destruction of any government in the United States...."<ref name=Levin>Levin, p 1488, [http://books.google.com/books?id=YoI14vYA8r0C&pg=PA1488& available online], accessed June 13, 2012</ref><ref name=SmithActText>The Smith Act was officially called the Alien Registration Act of 1940.

The portion of the 1940 Act that was relevant to the CPUSA trials was: <small>"Sec. 2. (a) It shall be unlawful for any person<U+2014> 
(1) to knowingly or willfully advocate, abet, advise, or teach the duty, necessity, desirability, or propriety of overthrowing or destroying any government in the United States by force or violence, or by the assassination of any officer of any such government; 
(2) with the intent to cause the overthrow or destruction of any government in the United States, to print, publish, edit, issue, circulate, sell, distribute, or publicly display any written or printed matter advocating, advising, or teaching the duty, necessity, desirability, or propriety of overthrowing or destroying any government in the United States by force or violence. 
(3) to organize or help to organize any society, group, or assembly of persons who teach, advocate, or encourage the overthrow or destruction of any government in the United States by force or violence; or to be or become a member of, or affiliate with, any such society, group, or assembly of persons, knowing the purposes thereof...."</small></ref> Five million non-citizens were fingerprinted and registered following passage of the Act.<ref>Kennedy, David M., ''The Library of Congress World War II Companion'', Simon and Schuster, 2007, p 86, ISBN 9780743252195.</ref> The [[Smith Act#Minneapolis 1941|first persons convicted]] under the Smith Act were members of the [[Socialist Workers Party (United States)|Socialist Workers Party]] (SWP) in [[Minneapolis]] in 1941.<ref>Belknap (1994), p 179.

The CPUSA's membership peaked at around 80,000 members during World War&nbsp;II under the leadership of [[Earl Browder]], who was not a strict [[Stalinist]] and cooperated with the US government during the war.<ref name="Belknap_a" /><ref>Hoover, J. Edgar, ''Masters of Deceit: the Story of Communism in America and How to Fight It'', Pocket Books, 1958, p 5 (80,000 peak in 1944).</ref>  In late 1945, [[hardliner]] [[William Z. Foster]] took over leadership of the CPUSA, and steered it on a course adhering to Stalin's policies.<ref name="Belknap_a" />   The CPUSA was not very influential in American politics, and by 1948 its membership had declined to 60,000 members.<ref name="Belknap_b"/> Truman did not feel that the CPUSA was a threat (he dismissed it as a "non problem") yet he made the specter of communism a campaign issue during the 1948 election.<ref>Belknap (1994), p 210. Truman quoted by Belknap. Belknap writes that Truman considered the CPUSA to be "a contemptible minority in a land of freedom".</ref>

The perception of communism in the US was shaped by the [[Cold War]], which began after World War&nbsp;II when the Soviet Union failed to uphold the commitments it made at the [[Yalta Conference]]. Instead of holding elections for new governments, as agreed at Yalta, the Soviet Union occupied several [[Eastern Bloc|Eastern European countries]], leading to a strained relationship with the US. Subsequent international events served to increase the apparent danger that communism posed to Americans: the Stalinist threats in the [[Greek Civil War]] (1946<U+2013>1949); the [[Czechoslovak coup d'<U+00E9>tat of 1948]]; and the 1948 [[Berlin Blockade|blockade of Berlin]].<ref name="Belknap_b">Belknap (1994), p 210.</ref>

The view of communism was also affected by evidence of espionage in the US conducted by agents of the USSR. In 1945, a Soviet spy, [[Elizabeth Bentley]], repudiated the USSR and provided a list of Soviet spies in the US to the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI).<ref> Theoharis, Atahn, ''The FBI: A Comprehensive Reference Guide'', Greenwood Publishing Group, 1999, p 27, ISBN 9780897749916.</ref> The FBI also had access to secret Soviet communications, available from the [[Venona]] decryption effort, which revealed significant efforts by Soviet agents to conduct espionage within the US.<ref name="Belknap_b"/><ref>Haynes, pp 8<U+2013>22.</ref>  The growing influence of communism  around the world and the evidence of Soviet spies within the US motivated the Department of Justice{{spaced ndash}}spearheaded by the FBI{{spaced ndash}}to initiate an investigation of communists within the US.<ref name="Belknap_a">Belknap (1994), p 209.</ref>

==1949 trial==
[[File:Hoover-JEdgar-LOC.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=A portrait of a man, standing, holding papers|[[J. Edgar Hoover]] initiated the case.]]
In July 1945, FBI director [[J. Edgar Hoover]] instructed his agents to begin gathering information on CPUSA members to support an analysis of the Party's subversive goals, leading to a 1,850-page report published in 1946 which outlined a case for prosecution.<ref>Redish, pp 81<U+2013>82, 248.

Hoover quoted by Morgan.<br/>Powers, p 215.</ref>

===Start of the trial===
[[File:WTM sheila 0036.jpg|thumb|alt=A large, stately building|The 1949 trial was held in the [[Foley Square U.S. Courthouse|Foley Square federal courthouse]] in Manhattan.]]
The 1949 trial was held in New York City at the [[Thurgood Marshall United States Courthouse|Foley Square federal courthouse]] of the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York]]. Judge [[Harold Medina]], a former [[Columbia University]] professor who had been on the bench for 18 months when the hearing began, presided.<ref name="Morgan">Morgan, p 314.<br/>Sabin, p 41.</ref> Before becoming a judge, Medina successfully argued the case of ''[[Cramer v. United States]]'' before the Supreme Court, defending a German-American charged with treason.<ref>''Cramer v. United States'', 325 U.S. 1, 1945.</ref><ref name=Oakes/>

The trial opened on November&nbsp;1, 1948, and preliminary proceedings and jury selection lasted until January&nbsp;17, 1949; the defendants first appeared in court on March 7, and the case concluded on October 14, 1949.<ref name=11Guilty/><ref name="Morgan_a">Morgan, p 315.</ref> Although later trials surpassed it, in 1949 it was the longest federal trial in US history.<ref name=11Guilty/><ref>Longer trials have been held since then, for example a 20-month trial in 1988 ([http://articles.latimes.com/1988-08-27/news/mn-888_1_mob-trial Longest Mob Trial Ends], ''Los Angeles Times'', August 27, 1988.  Retrieved June 10, 2012).</ref> The trial was one of the country's most contentious legal proceedings and sometimes had a "circus-like atmosphere".<ref>Walker, p 185.<br/>Morgan, p 315.<br/>Sabin, pp 44<U+2013>45. "Circus-like" are Sabin's words.</ref> Four hundred police officers were assigned to the site on the opening day of the trial.<ref name=11Guilty/> Magazines, newspapers, and radio reported on the case heavily; [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] magazine featured the trial on its cover twice with stories titled "Communists: The Presence of Evil" and "Communists: The Little Commissar" (referring to Eugene Dennis).<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19490425,00.html "Communists: The Little Commissar"], ''Time'', April 25, 1949 (Cover photo: Eugene Dennis).<br/>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,805104,00.html "Communists:  The Presence of Evil"], ''Time'': October 24, 1949.

Before the trial began, supporters of the defendants decided on a campaign of letter-writing and demonstrations: the CPUSA urged its members to bombard Truman with letters requesting that the charges be dropped.<ref>Belknap (1994), p 212.</ref> Later, supporters similarly flooded Judge Medina with telegrams and letters urging him to dismiss the charges.<ref name="Redish">Redish, p 82.</ref> During the proceedings, there were days when several thousand picketers protested in [[Foley Square]] outside the courthouse, chanting slogans like "Adolf Hitler never died&nbsp;/ He's sitting at Medina's side".<ref name="Morgan_a" /> In response, the [[US House of Representatives]] passed a bill in August to outlaw picketing near federal courthouses, but the [[US senate|Senate]] did not vote on it before the end of the trial.<ref name=11Guilty/><ref>Walker, p 186.</ref>

The defense made pre-trial [[Motion (legal)|motions]] arguing that the defendants' right to trial by a jury of their peers had been denied because, at that time, a potential [[grand jury|grand juror]] had to meet a minimum property requirement, effectively eliminating the less affluent from service.<ref>Belknap (1994), p 213.<br/>Walker, p 185.<br/>Starobin, p 206.<br/>Medina's ruling on the jury selection issue is [http://www.leagle.com/xmlResult.aspx?xmldoc=194928083FSupp197_1238.xml&docbase=CSLWAR1-1950-1985  83 F.Supp. 197 (1949)]. The issue was addressed by the appeals court in [http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/183/201/266559/ 183 F.2d 201 (2d Cir. 1950)].</ref> The defense also argued that the jury selection process for the trial was similarly flawed.<ref>Belknap (1994), p 213.</ref> Their objections to the jury selection process were not successful and jurors included four African Americans and consisted primarily of working-class citizens.<ref name="Belknap_d">Belknap (1994), p 214.</ref>

===Public opinion===
The opinion of the American public and the news media was overwhelming in favor of conviction.<ref>Belknap (1994), p 217. Belknap quotes an editorial from the left-leaning ''[[The New Republic]]'', written after the prosecution rested on May&nbsp;19, 1949:  "[the prosecution] failed to make out the overwhelming case that many people anticipated before the trial began".</ref> Most American newspapers supported the prosecution, such as the ''[[New York World Telegram]]'' which reported that the Communist Party would soon be punished.<ref name=M76>Martelle, p 76.  Martelle states that Shirer's statement was published in the ''New York Star''.</ref> The ''[[New York Times]]'', in an editorial, felt that the trial was warranted and refuted assertions of the Party that the trial was a provocation comparable to the [[Reichstag fire]].<ref>{{cite news |work=New York Times |url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F30913F73F59157A93C0AB178CD85F4C8485F9 |author= |title=The Communist Indictments |date=July 22, 1948 |accessdate=June 13, 2012 }}</ref> The ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'' took a more detached view in an editorial: "The outcome of the case will be watched by government and political parties around the world as to how the United States, as an outstanding exponent of democratic government, intends to share the benefits of its civil liberties and yet protect them if and when they appear to be abused by enemies from within".<ref name=M76/>

Not all media wholeheartedly supported the trial: Journalist [[William L. Shirer]] was skeptical of the trial, writing "no overt act of trying to forcibly overthrow our government is charged&nbsp;... The government's case is simply that by being members and leaders of the Communist Party, its doctrines and tactics being what they are, the accused are guilty of conspiracy".<ref name=M76/> ''[[The Washington Post]]'' wrote that the purpose of the government's legal attack on the CPUSA was "not so much the protection and security of the state as the exploitation of justice for the purpose of propaganda."<ref>Belknap (1994), p 214.   ''Washington Post'' quoted by Belknap.</ref>

[[Third party (United States)|Third-party]] presidential candidate [[Henry A. Wallace]] claimed that the trial was an effort by the Truman administration to create an atmosphere of fear, writing "we Americans have far more to fear from those actions which are intended to suppress political freedom than from the teaching of ideas with which we are in disagreement."<ref>{{cite news |work=New York Times |url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F20615F73F59157A93C0AB178CD85F4C8485F9 |author= |title=Indicted Reds Get Wallace Support |date=July 22, 1948 |accessdate=June 13, 2012 }}</ref> [[Farrell Dobbs]] of the SWP wrote{{spaced ndash}}despite the fact that the CPUSA had supported Dobbs' prosecution under the Smith Act in 1941{{spaced ndash}}"I want to state in no uncertain terms that I as well as the Socialist Workers Party support their struggle against the obnoxious Smith Act, as well as against the indictments under that act".<ref>{{cite news |work=New York Times |url= |author=Farrell Dobbs |title=Letters to the Times: Indictment of Communists |date=July 24, 1948 |accessdate=June 13, 2012 }}; letter dated July 22, 1948</ref>

The defense was not optimistic about the probability of success. After the trial was over, defendant Gates wrote: "The anti-communist hysteria was so intense, and most Americans were so frightened by the Communist issue, that we were convicted before our trial even started".<ref name="Belknap_k">Belknap (1994), p 208.</ref>

===Prosecution===
Prosecutor John McGohey did not assert that the defendants had a specific plan to violently overthrow the US government, but rather alleged that the CPUSA's philosophy generally advocated the violent overthrow of governments.<ref name="Belknap_d" /> The prosecution called witnesses who were either undercover informants, such as [[Angela Calomiris]] and [[Herbert Philbrick]], or former communists who had become disenchanted with the CPUSA, such as [[Louis Budenz]].<ref>Belknap (1994), pp 216<U+2013>217.</ref> The prosecution witnesses testified about the goals and policies of the CPUSA, and they interpreted the statements of pamphlets and books (including ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'') and works by such authors as [[Karl Marx]] and Joseph Stalin.<ref>Belknap (1994), p 214.<br/>Belknap (1994), p 209.</ref> The prosecution argued that the texts advocated violent revolution, and that by adopting the texts as their political foundation, the defendants were guilty of advocating violent overthrow of the government.<ref name="Belknap_a" />

Calomiris was recruited by the FBI in 1942 and infiltrated the CPUSA, gaining access to a membership roster.<ref name=Mah>Mahoney, M.H., ''Women in Espionage: A Biographical Dictionary'', Santa Barbara, California: ABC-CLIO, 1993, pp 37<U+2013>39.</ref> She received a salary from the FBI during her seven years as an informant.<ref name=Mah/> Calomiris identified four of the defendants as members of the CPUSA and provided information about its organization.<ref>"Girl Official of Party Stuns Reds at Trial", ''Chicago Daily Tribune'', April 27, 1949, p 21.</ref> She testified that the CPUSA espoused violent revolution against the government, and that the CPUSA{{spaced ndash}}acting on instructions from Moscow{{spaced ndash}}had attempted to recruit members working in key war industries.<ref>Martelle, pp.148&ndash;149.</ref>

Budenz, a former communist, was another important witness for the prosecution who testified that the CPUSA subscribed to a philosophy of violent overthrow of the government.<ref name="Belknap_d" /> He also testified that the clauses of the constitution of the CPUSA that disavowed violence were decoys written in "Aesopean language" which were put in place specifically to protect the CPUSA from prosecution.<ref name="Belknap_d" />

===Defense===

Many local affiliates of the ACLU supported second-tier communist defendants in the 1950s.</ref>

The defense employed a three-pronged strategy: First, they sought to portray the CPUSA as a conventional political party, which promoted socialism by peaceful means; second, they attacked the trial as a capitalist venture which could never provide a fair outcome for proletarian defendants; and third, they used the trial as an opportunity to publicize CPUSA policies.<ref>Walker, p 185.<br/>Belknap (1994), p 217.<br/>Sabin, pp 44<U+2013>46.</ref>

A primary theme of the defense was that the CPUSA sought to convert the US to socialism by education, not by force.<ref name="Belknap_e">Belknap (1994), p 219.</ref>  The defense claimed that most of the prosecution's documentary evidence came from older texts that pre-dated the 1935 Seventh World Congress of the [[Comintern]], after which the CPUSA rejected violence as a means of change.<ref>Belknap (1994), pp 219<U+2013>220.<br/>Starobin, p 207.</ref> The defense attempted to introduce documents into evidence which represented the CPUSA's advocacy of peace, claiming that these policies superseded the older texts that the prosecution had introduced which emphasized violence.<ref name="Belknap_e" /> Medina excluded most of the material proposed by the defense because it did not directly pertain to the specific documents the prosecution had produced. As a result, the defense complained that they were unable to portray the totality of their belief system to the jury.<ref name="Belknap_g">Belknap (1994), p 220.</ref>

The defense attorneys developed a "labor defense" strategy, by which they attacked the entire trial process, including the prosecutor, the judge, and the jury selection process.<ref name="Redishpp">Redish, pp 81<U+2013>82.</ref> The strategy involved verbally disparaging the judge and the prosecutors, and may have been an attempt to provoke a mistrial.<ref name="Sabin">Sabin, p 46.  "Mutual hostility" is Sabin's characterization.</ref> Another aspect of the labor defense was an effort to rally popular support to free the defendants, in the hope that public pressure would help achieve acquittals.<ref name="Redish"/>  Throughout the course of the trial, thousands of supporters of the defendants flooded the judge with protests, and marched outside the courthouse in Foley Square. The defense used the trial as an opportunity to educate the public about their beliefs, so they focused their defense around the political aspects of communism, rather than rebutting the legal aspects of the prosecution's evidence.<ref name="Belknap_f">Belknap (1994), p 218.</ref> Defendant Dennis chose to represent himself so he could, in his role as attorney, directly address the jury and explain communist principles.<ref name="Belknap_f" />

===Courtroom atmosphere===
The defense deliberately antagonized the judge by making a large number of objections and motions,<ref name="Morgan" /> which led to numerous bitter engagements between the attorneys and Judge Medina.<ref>Redish, p 82.<br/>Sabin, p 46.</ref> Despite the aggressive defense tactics and a voluminous letter-writing campaign directed at Medina, he stated "I will not be intimidated".<ref>Belknap (1994), p 218. Medina quoted by Belknap.</ref> Out of the chaos, an atmosphere of "mutual hostility" arose between the judge and attorneys.<ref name="Sabin" /> <!--Medina came to believe that the defense attorneys were using the trial as an opportunity to publicize communist propaganda, and that they deliberately were attempting to disrupt the trial using any means they could.<ref name="Redish" /> --> Judge Medina attempted to maintain order by removing disorderly defendants.  In the course of the trial, Medina sent five of the defendants to jail for outbursts, including Hall because he shouted "I've heard more law in a [[kangaroo court]]", and Winston{{spaced ndash}}an African American{{spaced ndash}}for shouting "more than five thousand Negroes have been lynched in this country".<ref>Sabin, pp 46<U+2013>47. Sabin writes that only four defendants were cited.<br/>Morgan, p 315 (Morgan erroneously quotes Winston as saying 500{{spaced ndash}}the correct quote is 5,000).<br/>Martelle, p 175.</ref>  Several times in July and August, the judge held defense attorneys in contempt of court, and told them their punishment would be meted out upon conclusion of the trial.<ref>Martelle, p 190.</ref>

Fellow judge [[James L. Oakes]] described Medina as a fair and reasonable judge, and wrote that "after the judge saw what the lawyers were doing, he gave them a little bit of their own medicine, too."<ref name=Oakes>Oakes, p 1460.</ref> Legal scholar and historian Michal Belknap writes that Medina was "unfriendly" to the defense, and that "there is reason to believe that Medina was biased against the defendants", citing a statement Medina made before the trial: "If we let them do that sort of thing [postpone the trial start], they'll destroy the government".<ref>Belknap (1994), pp 212, 220.</ref> According to Belknap, Medina's behavior towards the defense may have been exacerbated by the fact that another federal judge had died of a heart attack during [[Great Sedition Trial|the 1943 trial]] involving the Smith Act.<ref name="Redish" /><ref name="Belknap">Belknap (2001), p 860.</ref>  Some historians speculate that Medina came to believe that the defense was deliberately trying to provoke him into committing a legal error with the goal of achieving a mistrial.<ref name=Oakes/><ref name="Belknap_g" />
<!--Belknap asserts that the defendants could "insist with complete justification that they were the targets of a political prosecution",  and that "rather than attempting to prove eleven individuals guilty of criminal conduct, the prosecution mounted an attack on the CPUSA."<ref name="Belknap_d" />  Legal scholar Arthur Sabin writes that one of the jurors stated that "we must fight communism to the death" and spoke of his desire to "hang those Commies".<ref>Walker, p 185.<br/>Sabin, pp 44<U+2013>45.   Juror quoted by Sabin is novelist  Russell Janney.  See also Martelle, pp 189<U+2013>193.</ref>-->

===Events outside the courtroom===
During the ten-month trial, several events occurred in America that intensified the nation's  [[anti-communism|anti-communist]] sentiment:  The [[Judith Coplon]] Soviet espionage case was in progress; <!-- the [[University of California]] required all faculty members to take an oath asserting that they were not communists; --> former government employee [[Alger Hiss]] was tried for [[perjury]] stemming from accusations that he was a communist (a trial also held at the Foley Square courthouse); labor leader [[Harry Bridges]] was accused of perjury when he denied being a communist; and the ACLU passed an anti-communist resolution.<ref name="Sabin_a">Sabin, p 45.</ref><ref>Johnson, John W., "Icons of the Cold War: The Hiss<U+2013>Chambers Case", in ''Historic U.S. Court Cases: An Encyclopedia (Vol 1)'',  (John W.

===Convictions and sentencing===

On October&nbsp;14, 1949, after the defense rested their case, the judge gave the jury [[Jury instructions|instructions to guide them]] in reaching a verdict. He instructed the jury that the prosecution was not required to prove that the danger of violence was "clear and present"; instead, the jury should consider if the defendants had advocated communist policy as a "rule or principle of action" with the intention of inciting overthrow by violence "as speedily as circumstances would permit".<ref name=JuryInstr/> This instruction was in response to the defendants, who endorsed the "[[clear and present danger]]" test, yet that test was not adopted as law by the Supreme Court.<ref name=Dunlap/> The judge's instructions included the phrase "I find as a matter of law that there is sufficient danger of a substantive evil&nbsp;..." which would later be challenged by the defense during their appeals.<ref name=JuryInstr>Sabin, p 45.<br/>Belknap (1994), p 221.<br/>Redish, p 87.<br/> One instruction from Medina to the jury was "I find as a matter of law that there is sufficient danger of a substantive evil that the Congress had a right to prevent, to justify the application of the statute under the First Amendment of the Constitution."</ref> After deliberating for seven and one-half hours, the jury returned guilty verdicts against all eleven defendants.<ref name="Belknap_h">Belknap (1994), p 221.</ref> The judge sentenced ten defendants to five years and a $10,000 fine each (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|10000|1949}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}). The eleventh defendant, [[Robert G. Thompson]]{{spaced ndash}}a veteran of World War&nbsp;II{{spaced ndash}}was sentenced to three years in consideration of his wartime service.<ref>Morgan, p 317.</ref> Thompson said that he took "no pleasure that this Wall Street judicial flunky has seen fit to equate my possession of the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Cross]] to two years in prison."<ref>Belknap (1994), p 221.<br/>Morgan, p 317. Thompson quoted by Morgan.</ref>

Immediately after the jury rendered a verdict, Medina turned to the defense attorneys saying he had some "unfinished business" and he held them in contempt of court, and sentenced all of them to jail terms ranging from 30 days to six months; Dennis, acting as his own attorney, was also cited.<ref name=11Guilty/><ref>Attorney [[Maurice Sugar]], who participated in an advisory role, was not cited for contempt.</ref> Since the contempt sentences were based on behavior witnessed by the judge, no hearings were required for the contempt charges, and the attorneys were immediately handcuffed and led to jail.<ref name="Sabin_b">Sabin, p 47.</ref><ref>The regulation governing the contempt sentences was Rule 42(a) of the [[Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure]].<br/>Some of the contempt sentences were postponed pending appeal; for instance, Crockett served four months in an Ashland, Kentucky, Federal prison in 1952.

===Public reaction===
The vast majority of the public, and most news media, endorsed the verdict.<ref name="Belknap_h" /> Typical was a letter to the ''New York Times'': "The Communist Party may prove to be a hydra-headed monster unless we can discover how to kill the body as well as how to cut off its heads."<ref>{{cite news |work=New York Times |url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=FB0815F83F5F177B93CBA8178BD95F4D8485F9 |author=George D.

<!--
An editorial from the ''New York Times'' looked forward to a Supreme Court decision to resolve the legal issues:  "A good many thoughtful people who have no interest whatever in saving the individual necks of the eleven Communists defendants are concerned nevertheless that what we have forged is a two-edged sword; that if it can be used to cut down subversive enemies, it can also be used against persistent but non-violent dissidents.... On the other hand, it is pointed out, without some such tough statues as this the country remains helpless against what has proved to be its deadliest peacetime enemy."<ref>{{cite news |work=New York Times |url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F60B14FE3E5E107A93C4A8178BD95F4D8485F9 |author=Cabell Phillips |title=Communist Case to Provide Test of Smith Act |date=October 16, 1949 |accessdate=June 13, 2012 }}</ref>

Some vocal supporters of the defendants spoke out in their defense. A New York resident wrote: "I am not afraid of communism&nbsp;... I am only afraid of the trend in our country today away from the principles of democracy."<ref>{{cite news |work=New York Times |url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=FA0717F83F5F177B93CBA8178BD95F4D8485F9 |author=Mrs. D.

Abroad, the trial received little mention in mainstream press, but Communist newspapers were unanimous in their condemnation.<ref name=VAA>{{cite news |work=New York Times |url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F3091FFA3A59157A93C7A8178BD95F4D8485F9 |author= |title=Verdict Assailed Abroad |date=October 16, 1949 |accessdate=June 13, 2012 }}</ref> The Moscow press wrote that Medina showed "extraordinary prejudice"; the London communist newspaper wrote that the defendants had been convicted only of "being communists"; and in France, a paper decried the convictions as "a step on the road that leads to war."<ref name=VAA/>

On October 21, President Truman appointed prosecutor John McGohey to serve as a U.S. District Court judge.<ref>"[http://www.fjc.gov/servlet/nGetInfo?jid=1553 McGohey, John F.

===Bail and prison===
After sentencing, the defendants posted [[bail]], enabling them to remain free during the appeal process. The $260,000 bail (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|260000|1949}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) was  provided by [[Civil Rights Congress]], a non-profit trust fund which was created to assist CPUSA members with legal expenses.<ref>Belknap (1977), p 123.</ref> While out on bail, Hall was appointed to a position in the secretariat within the CPUSA. Eugene Dennis was{{spaced ndash}}in addition to his Smith Act charges{{spaced ndash}}fighting [[contempt of Congress]] charges stemming from an incident in 1947 when he refused to appear before the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]]. He appealed the contempt charge, but the Supreme Court upheld his conviction for contempt in March&nbsp;1950, and he began to serve a one-year term at that time.<ref>Associated Press, "Justices Uphold Red Conviction", ''Spokesman-Review'', March&nbsp;28, 1950.<br/>The conviction was upheld in [http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/339/162/ ''Dennis v. United States'', 339 U.S. 162 (1950)].</ref>

While waiting for their legal appeals to be heard, the CPUSA leaders became convinced that the government would undertake the prosecution of many additional Party officers. To ensure continuity of their leadership, they decided that four of the defendants should go into hiding and lead the CPUSA from outside prison.<ref name="Belknap_j">Belknap (1994), pp 224<U+2013>225.</ref> The defendants were ordered to report to prison on July&nbsp;2, 1951, after the Supreme Court upheld their convictions and their legal appeals were exhausted.<ref name="Belknap_j" />   When July arrived, only seven defendants reported to prison, and four (Winston, Green, Thompson, and Hall) went into hiding, forfeiting $80,000 bail (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|80000|1949}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}).<ref name="Belknap_j" /> Hall was captured in Mexico in 1951, trying to flee to the Soviet Union.

==Perception of communism in the United States==
[[File:Joseph McCarthy.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Portrait of a man in a suit.|Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]] was a prominent anti-communist.]]
The defendants of the 1949 trial appealed to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|federal Court of Appeals]], and then to the Supreme Court.<ref name="Sabin"/>  During the course of the legal appeals, the Cold War continued in the international arena.   In December 1950, Truman declared a [[national emergency]] in response to the Korean War.<ref name=ColdWar/> The [[First Indochina War]] continued in [[Vietnam]], in which communist forces in the north fought against [[French Union]] forces in the south.<ref name=ColdWar/> The US expanded the [[Radio Free Europe]] broadcasting system in an effort to promote Western political ideals in Eastern Europe.<ref name=ColdWar/> In March&nbsp;1951,  American communists [[Julius and Ethel Rosenberg]] were convicted of spying for the Soviet Union.<ref name=ColdWar/> In 1952, the US exploded its first [[hydrogen bomb]], and the Soviet Union followed suit in 1953.<ref name=ColdWar>Gregory, Ross, ''Cold War America, 1946 to 1990'', Infobase Publishing, 2003, pp 48<U+2013>53, ISBN	   9781438107981.<br/>Kort, Michael, ''The Columbia Guide to the Cold War'', Columbia University Press, 2001,

Domestically, the Cold War was in the forefront of national consciousness. In February 1950, Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]] rose suddenly to national fame when he claimed "I have here in my hand a list" of over 200 communists who were employed in the [[United States Department of State|State Department]].<ref>{{cite web|title = Communists in Government Service, McCarthy Says  |publisher = United States Senate History Website|url = http://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/minute/Communists_In_Government_Service.htm|accessdate =March 9, 2007}}<br/>McCarthy made the claim in [[The Wheeling speech]].</ref> In September 1950, the US&nbsp;Congress passed the [[McCarran Internal Security Act]], which required communist organizations to register with the government, and formed the [[Subversive Activities Control Board]] to investigate persons suspected of engaging in subversive activities. High-profile hearings involving alleged communists included the 1950 conviction of Alger Hiss, the 1951 trial of the Rosenbergs, and the 1954 investigation of [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]].<ref name="Belknap_k" />

The convictions in the 1949 trial encouraged the Department of Justice to prepare for additional prosecutions of CPUSA leaders. Three months after the trial, in January&nbsp;1950, a representative of the Justice Department testified before Congress during appropriation hearings to justify an increase in funding to support Smith Act prosecutions.<ref name=FBItestify>Sabin, p 56.<br>See also Fast, Howard, "The Big Finger", ''Masses & Mainstream'', March, 1950, pp 62<U+2013>68.</ref> He testified that there were 21,105 potential persons that could be indicted under the Smith Act, and that 12,000 of those would be indicted if the Smith Act was upheld as constitutional.<ref name=FBItestify/> The FBI had compiled a list of 200,000 persons in its [[FBI Index|Communist Index]]; since the CPUSA had only around 32,000 members in 1950, the FBI explained the disparity by asserting that for every official Party member, there were ten persons who were loyal to the CPUSA and ready to carry out its orders.<ref>Sabin, p 56 (200,000 figure).<br/>Navasky, p 26 (32,000 figure).</ref> Seven months after the convictions, in May&nbsp;1950, Hoover gave a radio address in which he declared "communists have been and are today at work within the very gates of America.... Wherever they may be, they have in common one diabolic ambition: to weaken and to eventually destroy American democracy by stealth and cunning."<ref>
Heale, M. J., ''American Anticommunism: Combating the Enemy Within, 1830<U+2013>1970'', JHU Press, 1990, p 162,  ISBN 9780801840517.  Hoover quoted by Heale.<br/>Sabin, p 56.</ref>

Other federal government agencies also worked to undermine organizations, such as the CPUSA, they considered subversive: The [[Internal Revenue Service]] investigated 81&nbsp;organizations that were deemed to be subversive, threatening to revoke their tax exempt status; Congress passed a law prohibiting members of subversive organizations from obtaining [[National Housing Act of 1934|federal housing benefits]]; and attempts were made to deny Social Security benefits, veterans benefits, and unemployment benefits to communist sympathizers.<ref>Sabin, p 60.</ref>

==Legal appeals of 1949 trial==
The 1949 trial defendants appealed to the [[Second Circuit Court of Appeals]] in 1950.<ref name="Belknap 2005, pp 258<U+2013>259"/>  In the appeal they raised issues about the use of informant witnesses, the impartiality of the jury and judge, the judge's conduct, and [[Freedom of speech in the United States|free speech]].<ref name="Belknap 2005, pp 258<U+2013>259">Belknap (2005), pp 258<U+2013>259.</ref>   Their free speech arguments raised important constitutional issues:  they asserted that their political advocacy was protected by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]], because the CPUSA did not advocate imminent violence, but instead merely promoted revolution as an abstract concept.

===Free speech law===
::''See also: [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution#Speech critical of the government|First Amendment issues related to speech critical of government]]''
Before the twentieth century, most free speech issues involved [[prior restraint]].  Starting in the early 1900s, the Supreme Court began to consider cases in which persons were punished <em>after</em>  speaking or publishing.  The primary legal test used in the United States to determine if speech could be criminalized was the  [[bad tendency]] test.<ref name=RCL>Rabban, pp 132&ndash;134, 190&ndash;199.</ref> Rooted in English [[common law]], the test permitted speech to be outlawed if it had a tendency to harm public welfare.<ref name=RCL/>  One of the earliest cases in which the Supreme Court  addressed punishment after material was published was   1907's ''[[Patterson v. Colorado]]'' in which the Court used the bad tendency test to uphold contempt charges against a newspaper publisher who accused Colorado judges of acting on behalf of local utility companies.<ref name=RCL/><ref>''Patterson v. Colorado'', 205 U.S. 454 (1907).<br/>Before 1907, most free speech issues addressed [[prior restraint]] rather than punishment after speaking.</ref>

Anti-war protests during World War I gave rise to several important free speech cases related to sedition and inciting violence.  In the 1919 case ''[[Schenck v. United States]]''  the Supreme Court held that an anti-war activist did not have a First Amendment right to speak out against the draft.<ref>Killian, p 1093.</ref><ref>''Schenck v. United States'', 249 U.S. 47 (1919).</ref>   In his majority opinion,  [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.|Justice Holmes]] introduced the [[clear and present danger]] test, which would become an important concept in First Amendment law; but the ''Schenck'' decision did not formally adopt the test.<ref>Killian, p 1093.</ref>  Holmes later wrote that he intended the clear and present danger test to refine, not replace,  the bad tendency test.<ref name=Dunlap/><ref>Rabban, pp 285&ndash;286.</ref>   Although sometimes mentioned in subsequent rulings, the clear and present danger test was never endorsed by the Supreme Court as a test to be used by lower courts when evaluating the constitutionality of legislation that regulated speech.<ref name=K60>Killian, pp 1096, 1100.</br>Currie, David P., ''The Constitution in the Supreme Court: The Second Century, 1888-1986, Volume 2'',  University of Chicago Press, 1994, p 269, ISBN  9780226131122.</br>Konvitz, Milton Ridvad, ''Fundamental Liberties of a Free People: Religion, Speech, Press, Assembly'', 	Transaction Publishers, 2003, p 304,  ISBN 9780765809544.<br/>Eastland,  p 47.</ref><ref>The Court would adopt the [[imminent lawless action]] test in 1969's [[Brandenburg v. Ohio]], 395 U.S. 444 (1969), which some commentators view as a modified version of the clear and present danger test.</ref>

The Court continued to use the bad tendency test during the early twentieth century in cases such as 1919's ''[[Abrams v. United States]]'' which upheld the conviction of anti-war activists who passed out leaflets encouraging workers to impede the war effort.<ref>''Abrams v. United States'', 250 U.S. 616 (1919).<br/>The bad tendency test was also used in ''Frohwerk v. United States'', 249 U.S. 204 (1919); ''Debs v. United States'', 249 U.S. 211 (1919); and  ''Schaefer v. United States'', 251 U.S. 466 (1920).<br/>See Rabban, David, "Clear and Present Danger Test", in ''The Oxford Companion to the Supreme Court of the United States'', p 183, 2005, ISBN 9780195176612 .</ref>  In ''Abrams'', Holmes and [[Louis Brandeis|Justice Brandeis]] dissented and encouraged the use of the clear and present test, which provided more protection for speech.<ref>Killian, p. 1094.<br/>Rabban, p 346.</br>Redish, p 102.</ref>   In 1925's ''[[Gitlow v. New York]]'',  the Court extended the First Amendment  to the states, and upheld the conviction of Gitlow for publishing the "[[Left_Wing_Manifesto#.22Left_Wing_Manifesto.22_issued_by_the_Left_Wing_National_Council|Left Wing Manifesto]]".<ref>''Gitlow v.

The defendants appealed the Second Circuit's decision to the Supreme Court in ''[[Dennis v. United States]]''. During the Supreme Court appeal, the defendants were assisted by the [[National Lawyers Guild]] and the ACLU.<ref name="Belknap_i"/> The Supreme Court limited its consideration to the questions of the constitutionality of the Smith Act and the jury instructions, and did not rule on the issues of impartiality, jury composition, or informant witnesses.<ref name="Belknap 2005, pp 258<U+2013>259"/> The 6<U+2013>2 decision was issued on June 4, 1951, and upheld Hand's decision.  Chief Justice [[Fred M.

Vinson's opinion also addressed the contention that Medina's jury instructions were faulty. The defendants claimed that Medina's statement that "as matter of law that there is sufficient danger of a substantive evil that the Congress has a right to prevent to justify the application of the statute under the First Amendment of the Constitution" was erroneous, but Vinson concluded that the instructions were an appropriate interpretation of the Smith Act.<ref name=Dennis/>

==Trials of "second-tier" officials==
[[File:Elizabeth G. Flynn.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Image of a formally dressed woman, seated, around 1930.|[[Elizabeth Gurley Flynn]] was one of the second-tier defendants.]]
After the 1949 convictions, prosecutors waited until the constitutional issues were settled by the Supreme Court before they tried additional leaders of the CPUSA.<ref name=Levin/> When the 1951 ''Dennis'' decision upholding the convictions was announced, prosecutors initiated indictments of 132 additional CPUSA leaders, called "second string" or "second-tier" defendants.<ref>Sabin p 59 (the 132 were in addition to the twelve from 1949).

The second-tier defendants had a difficult time finding lawyers to represent them.

To supply witnesses for the second-tier trials, the Justice Department relied on a dozen informants, who traveled full-time from trial to trial, testifying about communism and the CPUSA. The informants were paid for their time; for example, Budenz earned $70,000  (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|70000|1952}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) from his activities as a witness.<ref>Oshinsky, David M., ''A Conspiracy So Immense: the World of Joe McCarthy'', Oxford University Press, 2005, p 149, ISBN 9780029234907 (discusses Budenz's income, which includes revenue from lectures and books, as well as compensation from the government for testifying).<br/>Navasky, pp 33, 38.<br/>Sabin, pp 62<U+2013>63.</ref>

==Aftermath==
The ''Yates'' and ''Noto'' decisions undermined the Smith Act and marked the beginning of the end of CPUSA membership inquiries.<ref>Walker, pp 240&ndash;242.</ref> When the trials came to an end in 1958, 144 persons had been indicted, resulting in 105 convictions, with cumulative sentences totaling 418 years and $435,500 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|435500|1952}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) in fines.<ref>Belknap (1994), pp 225&ndash;226.<br/>Sabin, p 60.<br/>Not all indictments led to convictions: ten were acquitted, one died, three did not go to trial due to ill health, and one had a hung jury (Belknap (1994) p 225).</ref> Fewer than half the convicted communists served jail time.<ref name=Levin/>  The Smith Act, {{usc|18|2385}}, though amended several times, has not been repealed.<ref>Wolf, Adam B., "Anti-Anarchy and Anti-Syndicalism Statutes", in Finkelman (vol 1), p 68.<br/>The provision requiring registration was revoked in 1982.

For two decades after the ''Dennis'' decision, free speech issues related to advocacy of violence were decided using balancing tests such as the one initially articulated in ''Dennis''.<ref>Including cases such as  ''Konigsberg v. State Bar of California'', 366 U.S. 36 (1961).<br/>Killian, pp 1101&ndash;1103.</ref>  In 1969, the court established stronger protections for speech in the landmark case ''[[Brandenburg v. Ohio]]''  which held that  "the constitutional guarantees of free speech and free press do not permit a State to forbid or proscribe advocacy of the use of force or of law violation except where such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action".<ref>''Brandenburg v. Ohio'', 395 U.S. 444 (1969).</ref><ref>Redish pp 104&ndash;106.<br/>Killian, pp 1109&ndash;1110.</ref>  ''Brandenburg'' is now the standard applied by the Court to  free speech issues related to advocacy of violence.<ref>E.g. in cases such as ''Hess v. Indiana'', 414 U.S. 105 (1973).<br/>Redish, p 105.<br/>Kemper, p 653.</ref>
