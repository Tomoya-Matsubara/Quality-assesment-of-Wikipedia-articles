'''Jack Sarfatti''' (born September 14, 1939) is an American [[Theoretical physics|theoretical physicist]] specializing in the relationship between [[quantum physics]] and [[consciousness]]. Working largely outside academia, he argues that [[mind]] may be crucial to the structure of matter, that [[retrocausality]] may be possible, and that physics<U+2014>which he calls the "Conceptual Art of the late 20th Century"<U+2014>has replaced philosophy as the unifying force between science and art.<ref>For his work on consciousness, see [[Robert Kane (philosopher)|Kane, Robert]].

Sarfatti was part of an informal group of physicists in California known as the [[Fundamental Fysiks Group]], who in the 1970s, according to [[David Kaiser]], a physicist and historian of science at MIT, helped to nurture some of the alternative ideas in quantum physics that today form the basis of [[quantum information science]].<ref>Kaiser, David.

==Research, ideas, and reception==
===Fundamental Fysiks Group===
{{see|Fundamental Fysiks Group}}
[[File:Sarfatti-Wolf.jpg|thumb|200px|alt=photograph|Sarfatti (left) with physicist [[Fred Alan Wolf]] in Paris, 1973]]
Sarfatti was one of a group of around 10 physicists in the San Francisco area in the 1970s who became part of the Fundamental Fysiks Group at the [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]].<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20110716205057/http://forum-network.org/lecture/how-hippies-saved-physics Kaiser 2010], from 24:00 mins.
*For a group reunion, see [http://quantumtantra.com/reunion.html "25th reunion of the Fundamental Physics Group"], quantumtantra.com, accessed April 25, 2011.</ref> Apart from Sarfatti, the group included its founder [[Elizabeth Rauscher]], as well as [[Henry Stapp]], [[Fred Alan Wolf]], [[Nick Herbert (physicist)|Nick Herbert]], [[Fritjof Capra]], [[John Clauser]], Philippe Eberhard, Saul-Paul Sirag, and George Weissman<U+2014>a "very smart and very playful" group, according to Kaiser, with Sarfatti as the star. Some of them held jobs within academia, but others had been left under-employed when the post-war boom in physics ended. Kaiser writes that, holding PhDs in theoretical physics from elite universities, they tried to carve out new roles for themselves, writing about [[quantum mysticism]] and becoming part of the Bay Area's counterculture and [[New Age]] movement.<ref name=KaiserHippies/> Sarfatti's involvement with these issues did not advance his academic career, though he regarded his exile from academia as self-imposed.<ref name=Burns/>

According to Kaiser, quantum theory<U+2014>particularly [[Bell's theorem]] and the concept of [[quantum entanglement]]<U+2014>had raised questions about [[parapsychology]] and issues such as [[telepathy]]. In ''How the Hippies Saved Physics'' (2011), he explains how the Fundamental Fysiks Group cultivated patrons outside academia, including the human potential movement (see [[#Physics-Consciousness Research Group|below]]), who they hoped might be interested in the broader application of these ideas.<ref name=KaiserHippies>For a synopsis of the book, see Kaiser, David.

HarperOne, 2001 (first published 1979), p. x.</ref> There was also significant government interest. The [[Central Intelligence Agency]] and [[Defense Intelligence Agency]] set up a program called ESPionage, financing experiments into telepathy and [[remote viewing]] to the tune of tens of millions each year. The research was conducted by the [[Stanford Research Institute]] (SRI), where Sarfatti and the Fundamental Fysiks Group became what Kaiser calls its "house theorists."<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20110716205057/http://forum-network.org/lecture/how-hippies-saved-physics Kaiser 2010], around 28 mins.</ref>

The group became local celebrities in San Francisco.

===Research into Uri Geller===
[[File:Uri Geller and Jack Sarfatti by Mark Pilkington.jpg|thumb|220px|alt=photograph|[[Uri Geller]] with Sarfatti (right), photographed by Mark Pilkington in October 2006]]
In 1974 Sarfatti and the group helped the Stanford Research Institute suggest a theoretical background to research involving [[Uri Geller]], an Israeli who had become known for his assertion that he could [[Spoon bending|bend spoons]] and make watches start or stop by using only what he said were his thoughts. The SRI had begun to study Geller in its parapsychology lab in 1972 to determine whether he was using [[psychokinesis]]; the studies were led by laser physicists [[Russell Targ]] and [[Harold Puthoff]], and resulted in a paper in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in October 1974.<ref>Targ, Russell and Puthoff, Harold.

Sarfatti organized follow-up tests at [[Birkbeck College]], London. The study was led by [[John Hasted]], and on June 21 and 22, 1974, Hasted and Sarfatti joined [[David Bohm]], [[Arthur Koestler]], [[Arthur C. Clarke]], and two of Geller's associates, [[Ted Bastin]] and Brendan O'Regan, to watch Geller display what he said were his psychokinetic powers. Geller bent four brass [[Yale key]]s and a 1&nbsp;cm disk, affected a [[Geiger counter]] and deflected a [[compass needle]]. ''[[New Scientist]]'' wrote at the time that any good magician could have bent the keys, no matter how closely the observers believed they were watching. Sarfatti issued two press releases saying he believed Geller had demonstrated genuine psycho-energetic ability, statements that were picked up by ''[[Science News]]'' and the international media, though he later retracted his view.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=W4_tDVYfHcEC&pg=PA184 "Geller performs at Birkbeck"], ''New Scientist'', October 17, 1974.

===Physics-Consciousness Research Group===
Outside government, groups within the [[human potential movement]] were also interested in applying ideas from quantum theory. [[Werner Erhard]], the founder of Erhard Seminars Training, or EST, believed there had to be a way to use quantum theory to expand human consciousness. He moved to the Bay Area and came into contact with Sarfatti and Fred Alan Wolf. According to Kaiser, they hit it off, and had their lawyers formally create a non-profit think tank called the Physics-Consciousness Research Group<U+2014>with Sarfatti as president, and Saul-Paul Sirag vice-president<U+2014>into which Erhard and others funneled significant amounts of money. The group gave local lectures, published pamphlets, and wrote an opera about quantum physics and the brain, which they staged in a Bay Area park.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20110716205057/http://forum-network.org/lecture/how-hippies-saved-physics Kaiser 2010], from 28:00 mins.</ref>

Erhard introduced Sarfatti to [[Michael Murphy (author)|Michael Murphy]], co-director of the [[Esalen Institute]] in [[Big Sur]], California, which had become what Kaiser calls an incubator for New-Age ideas and their potential application. In January 1976, Sarfatti and the physics group gathered there for a month-long conference on physics and consciousness. Murphy's announcement of the conference said, "Perhaps a new kind of inspired physicist, experienced in the yogic modes of perception, must emerge to comprehend the further reaches of matter, space, and time." Sarfatti was the conference's intellectual director, and wrote to major figures asking them to address it. Gary Zukav's best-selling ''[[The Dancing Wu Li Masters]]'' (1979)<U+2014>a book about these new ideas<U+2014>was organized around his attendance at this conference; he and Sarfatti were roommates in North Beach at the time. The conference apart, the Esalen group held regular workshops on quantum theory, with physicists from around the world attending, mixing lectures with yoga and sessions in the hot tubs.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20110716205057/http://forum-network.org/lecture/how-hippies-saved-physics Kaiser 2010], from 33:00 mins.</ref>

===Publication and research outside academia===
====''Epistemological Letters'' and Unicorn Preprint Service====
The new ideas were not invariably welcome within mainstream academic physics. According to Kaiser, [[Samuel Abraham Goudsmit|Samuel Goudsmit]], editor of the prestigious ''[[Physical Review]]'', formally banned discussion of the interpretation of quantum mechanics, drawing up special instructions to referees to reject material that even hinted at the philosophical debate. The new material therefore ended up being distributed in alternative media. One such publication was a hand-typed newsletter called ''Epistemological Letters'', published by a Swiss Foundation. Several eminent physicists and philosophers had to publish their material there<U+2014>including the Irish physicist [[John Stewart Bell|John Bell]], the originator of [[Bell's theorem]]<U+2014>as well as Sarfatti and other members of the Physics-Consciousness Research Group.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20110716205057/http://forum-network.org/lecture/how-hippies-saved-physics Kaiser 2010], from 38:00 mins.</ref>

The group were also involved in a mailing list, the core members of which were Sarfatti and Fred Alan Wolf, called the Unicorn Preprint Service, which was financed by [[Ira Einhorn]], an American anti-war and environmental activist with good New York publishing contacts. It was Einhorn who arranged for the publication of Bob Toben's ''Space-Time and Beyond'' (1975), co-written by Sarfatti and Wolf. The list distributed articles not published elsewhere, and included some eminent thinkers, people such as [[Thomas Kuhn]] and [[Gerald Feinberg]], though recipients often had their names added without being asked. It was intended, as Kaiser puts it, as an end-run around mainstream, peer-reviewed publication. Kaiser calls it a "parallel universe," though he says it was a fragile one, which ended in the late 1970s when Einhorn was charged with the murder of his girlfriend.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20110716205057/http://forum-network.org/lecture/how-hippies-saved-physics Kaiser 2010], from 40:00 mins.</ref>

Sarfatti's local fame in North Beach, San Francisco, continued throughout the 1980s with regular seminars he gave on physics and consciousness in the Caffe Trieste on Vallejo Street. The novelist [[Herbert Gold]] in ''Bohemia'' (1994) called it "Sarfatti's Cave," after [[Allegory of the Cave|Plato's cave]]:

{{quote|Sarfatti's Cave is the name I'll give to the Caffe Trieste in San Francisco, where Jack Sarfatti, Ph.D. in physics, writes his poetry, evokes his mystical, miracle-working ancestors, and has conducted a several-decade-long seminar on the nature of reality and his own love life to a rapt succession of espresso scholars. He sings Gilbert and Sullivan songs. He suffers tragic reverses among women. He issues ultimatums to the CIA, the FBI, Werner Erhard, the navy, the KGB, and the Esalen Institute. With ample charm and boyish smiles he issues nonnegotiable demands. He has access to a photocopying machine. It's Jack Sarfatti against the world, and he is indomitable.<p>

One of his soaring theories is that things which have not happened yet can cause events in the present. ... With just a little more, one more grant, one venturesome patron, one young woman with a trust fund, he can build the machine to prove his theories. Already in his possession are the theorems, formula, algebra, and the poetry for it. He covers sheets of paper. He can prove everything<U+2014>here's a sheet of paper with guaranteed algebra, physics, and citations from ''Faust''.<ref>Herbert, Gold. ''Bohemia: Where Art, Angst, Love, and Strong Coffee Meet''. Simon & Schuster, 1993, p. 15.</ref>}}

====Conferences and ''Stardrive''====
Sarfatti continued to attend academic conferences and in February 1986 argued during a meeting at the New York Academy of Sciences that [[faster-than-light]] communication was possible using [[time loop]]s, and said he had tried to attract the support of the Defense Department to develop the research.<ref>Browne, Malcolm W.

November 20, 1995.</ref> 

His work outside academia continued into the 2000s. He was appointed senior scientist in 1999<U+2013>2000 by the International Space Sciences Organization, a group set up by [[Joe Firmage]], the Internet entrepreneur, to explore [[Quantum mind<U+2013>body problem|mind-matter]] issues.<ref name=Enge>Enge, Marliee.

He was one of three physicists whose invitations to an August 2010 conference on [[De Broglie<U+2013>Bohm theory|de Broglie-Bohm theory]]<U+2014>organized by [[Mike Towler]] of the University of Cambridge's Cavendish Laboratory<U+2014>were withdrawn.

David Peat]], David Bohm's biographer; and [[Brian Josephson]], who shared the 1973 Nobel Prize for Physics and led the [[Brian_Josephson#Mind.E2.80.93Matter_Unification_Project|Mind-Matter Unification Project]] at Cambridge. According to ''Times Higher Education'' (THE), Peat's invitation was withdrawn because he had written about [[Carl Jung|Jungian]] [[synchronicity]], and Josephson's because of his interest in parapsychology. Peat's and Josephson's invitations were later restored; THE did not explain why Sarfatti was uninvited.<ref>Reisz, Matthew.
