==Career==

===2008<U+2013>2011: ''StyleRookie''===
Gevinson started a fashion blog, ''Style Rookie'', in 2008.<ref name=dailymail>{{cite news | url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1215048/Meet-Tavi-Gevinson-13-tiny-blogger-fashion-industry-feet.html | title=Meet Tavi | work=The Daily Mail | date=23 September 2009 | accessdate=23 January 2010 | last=Rawi | first=Maysa | location=London}}</ref> The blog, featuring photos of the eleven-year-old in distinctive outfits and her commentary on the latest fashion trends, began drawing nearly 30,000 readers each day.<ref>{{cite web|last=Twohey |first=Megan |url=http://seattletimes.com/html/living/2010767377_fashionplate12.html |title=Petite teen becomes big voice in fashion world |publisher=Seattletimes.com |date=2010-01-12 |accessdate=2013-05-13}}</ref> Her father "wasn't terribly interested" in her new hobby until she asked for his permission to be interviewed by ''[[The New York Times]]'' for an article about young bloggers.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.usatoday.com/tech/webguide/internetlife/2008-08-12-girl-fashion-blogs_N.htm | title=Young fashion bloggers are worrisome trend to parents | work=USA Today | agency=Associated Press | last=Kwan | first=Amanda | accessdate=23 January 2010 | date=13 August 2008}}</ref> Because of the blog's success, Gevinson was invited to attend [[New York Fashion Week]] and [[Paris Fashion Week]]. She made overseas fashion-related trips to Tokyo and Antwerp, funded by ''[[Pop (fashion magazine)|Pop]]'' magazine,<ref name="newyorker.com"/> and was commissioned to write articles for ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'' and [[Barneys New York|Barneys.com]]. She styled a shoot for ''[[BlackBook]]'' magazine,<ref name="newyorker.com"/> acted as a muse and model for [[Rodarte]]'s clothing line at [[Target (store)|Target]] stores,<ref name="newyorker.com"/><ref>{{cite journal| url=http://www.teenvogue.com/style/blogs/fashion/2009/11/tavi-gevinson-in-rodarte-for-target.html |title=Tavi Gevinson defines Rodarte for Target | work=Teen Vogue |date=November 16, 2009 |accessdate=2010-01-22}}</ref> and partnered with Borders&Frontiers to design and sell her own t-shirt.<ref>[http://www.catwalkqueen.tv/2009/06/bloggers_turn_designer.html Bloggers turn designers... who's next?] Catwalk Queen</ref> In 2010, she spoke at a marketing conference in New York and at Idea City, a Canadian version of the [[TED (conference)|TED conference]].<ref name="newyorker.com"/>

There was a backlash to Gevinson's early success in the fashion industry. ''[[New York (magazine)|New York Magazine]]'' questioned whether it was possible for Gevinson to write her blog without "some help from a mom or older sister".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/thecut/2008/07/meet_tavi_the_12yearold_fashio.html |title=Meet Tavi, the 12-Year-Old Fashion Blogger - The Cut |publisher=Nymag.com |date=2008-07-22 |accessdate=2013-05-13}}</ref> Sarah Mower of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', while conceding that Gevinson had a "truly independent, original voice", criticized her father for taking her out of school "to go to haute couture shows ...

I felt like, there were people who were [at fashion week] because of their name, their money or their family, and I didn<U+2019>t have any of those things.<U+201D><ref>{{cite web|author=Laura Kane |url=http://www.thestar.com/living/article/1276235--tavi-gevinson-teenage-rookie-still-figuring-it-out |title=Tavi Gevinson: Teenage "Rookie" still figuring it out |work=Toronto Star |publisher=Thestar.com |date=2012-10-24 |accessdate=2013-05-13}}</ref>

===2011<U+2013>present: ''Rookie'' and acting roles===
In early 2011, Gevinson decided to stop writing primarily about fashion: "Lately I've been looking to other places for a creative outlet and for inspiration ...
