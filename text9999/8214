'''The Airborne Toxic Event''' is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band from [[Los Feliz, Los Angeles, California]] comprising Mikel Jollett (vocals, guitar, keyboards), Steven Chen (guitar, keyboards), Noah Harmon (bass), Daren Taylor (drums) and Anna Bulbrook (viola, keyboards, tambourine, backing vocals). Named after a section of the book ''[[White Noise (novel)|White Noise]]'', by [[Don DeLillo]], the group incorporates string instruments and [[Keyboard instrument|keyboards]], along with a standard rock lineup of [[guitar]], [[Drum kit|drums]], and [[bass guitar]]. 

Initially releasing their debut via Majordomo (an imprint of [[Shout! Factory]]) in 2008, the band switched to a major in 2009, [[Island Records]].

==History==
===Formation and early history===
The band was formed in 2006 by Mikel Jollett. During a one-week period in March 2006 while working on a novel, Jollett learned that his mother was diagnosed with [[cancer]], he also experienced a break-up and was diagnosed with a genetic [[autoimmune disease]] which led Jollett to develop two cosmetic conditions: [[Alopecia areata]] and [[Vitiligo]].  Spurred by these events in his personal life, Jollett turned from writing prose to writing songs as he realized he was composing an album instead of a novel.<ref>{{cite web | title=Taking the L.A. indie rock scene personally | url=http://theguide.latimes.com/general/latcl-taking-the-l-a-indie-rock-scene-article | last=Bronson | first=Kevin | work=The Guide | work=[[The Los Angeles Times]] | date=2007-08-25 | accessdate=2009-05-29}}</ref>

Jollett met drummer Taylor in the summer of 2006 and the two established an immediate rapport. After working on original material together for four months as a two-piece, Jollett asked classically-trained [[violin]]ist Bulbrook and [[bassist]] Harmon to join the band. A situation that Jollett enjoys re-telling with relish, Harmon initially refused. With a background in [[orchestral]] and [[chamber music]], Bulbrook since taught herself to play [[viola]] and keyboard, while Harmon holds a [[jazz]] degree in [[upright bass]] performance from the [[California Institute of the Arts]] and taught in [[East Los Angeles, California|East Los Angeles]] as part of the school<U+2019>s Community Arts Partnership. Jollett had met Chen several years earlier, when both lived in [[San Francisco]]. Chen was at first asked to join as a keyboardist, but revealed to Jollett that he in fact, played guitar and filled the role as lead guitarist.

To supplement his [[fiction]] writing, Jollett had earned income as a freelance writer, contributing to organizations such as [[NPR]], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', ''[[Filter (magazine)|Filter]]'' magazine and ''[[Men's Health]]''. Since the creation of the band, he has continued to write only fiction.  Jollett's short story "The Crack" was published in the Summer 2008 [[McSweeney's]] issue 27 sandwiched between short stories by Liz Mandrell and [[Stephen King]].<ref>[http://store.mcsweeneys.net/index.cfm/fuseaction/catalog.detail/object_id/aa5ec80d-0bc9-45ea-9bce-275ed0c28bb9/McSweeneysIssue27.cfm The McSweeney's Store: Issue 27]</ref>

The band takes its name from the postmodern novel ''[[White Noise (novel)|White Noise]]'', by [[Don DeLillo]],<ref>[http://musicvice.com/interviews/theairbornetoxicevent_september2008.html  Music Vice - interview with the band discussing the origins of their name, among other things]</ref> which won the [[National Book Award]] in 1985. In the book, a chemical spill from a railcar releases a poisonous cloud, dubbed by the military as an "airborne toxic event". This serves as a metaphorical device for the novel's themes of mortality and media consumption, as the protagonist Jack Gladney is forced to confront the prospect of his own death.

The Airborne Toxic Event played its first show in [[Echo Park, Los Angeles, California|Echo Park]] in the fall of 2006, less than a month after it was fully formed. Since then, the band has performed extensively in L.A.  and become well known throughout the greater Los Angeles area. In December 2006, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' named them one of the <U+201C>Top 25 Bands on MySpace.<U+201D><ref>[http://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2006/12/22/rolling-stone-declares-the-25-best-bands-on-myspace/ Rolling Stone Declares the 25 Best Bands on MySpace : Rolling Stone : Rock and Roll Daily<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> They went on to receive positive responses from music blogs and press, notably ''[[L.A. Weekly]]''<ref>[http://www.laweekly.com/music/diggin-your-scene/the-airborne-toxic-event/15856/ ''LA Weekly'' - Music - The Airborne Toxic Event - Alie Ward - The Essential Online Resource for Los Angeles<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'',<ref>[http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/buzzbands/2007/02/that_sound_you_.html Buzz Bands: ''Los Angeles Times''<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> which named the group one of the top three L.A. bands to watch in 2008. Previous bands to receive this distinction include [[Cold War Kids]] and [[Silversun Pickups]].

In a rare move, during the band's January 2008 residency at the popular [[Silver Lake, Los Angeles, California|Silver Lake]] venue [[Spaceland]], Los Angeles Commercial Radio stations [[KROQ]], [[Indie 103]] and [[KYSR]] all officially added the as-yet-unsigned band's song "Sometime Around Midnight" to regular rotation. [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]]'s [[WBRU]], [[Seattle]]'s [[KEXP]], [[San Francisco|San Francisco<U+2019>s]] [[Live 105]], [[San Diego|San Diego<U+2019>s]] [[91X]], [[Boston]]'s [[WFNX]], and Sacramento's KWOD 106.5 also showed significant support for the group. 

On April 24, 2008  the band made its national television debut as the musical guest on the late-night [[NBC]] talk show ''[[Last Call with Carson Daly]]''.<ref>{{youtube|K1x07X-x54E|The Airborne Toxic Event - "Sometime Around Midnight"}}</ref> After an extensive courtship from major labels, the Airborne Toxic Event signed with the indie imprint Majordomo Records in April 2008. Their first full-length record was released in the U.S. on August 5, 2008.

In August 2008, the band performed a three-song live video set for LiveDaily Sessions, including the songs "This Losing", "Sometime Around Midnight" and "Gasoline",<ref name=LiveDailySessions>[http://www.livedaily.com/sessions/31.html Video performance of "This Losing", "Sometime Around Midnight" and "Gasoline" by The Airborne Toxic Event at LiveDaily Sessions]</ref> which premiered on August 18, 2008.

On March 10, 2009 [[U2]] played some of their favorite songs on a radio program hosted by [[Shirley Manson]] of [[Garbage (band)|Garbage]]. Bass player [[Adam Clayton]] chose "Sometime Around Midnight" as his choice, commenting that he felt he would be listening to their album the rest of the year.

The video to 'Happiness Is Overrated' was posted on ClashMusic.com on June 12, 2009. <ref>http://www.clashmusic.com/feature/watch-new-airborne-toxic-event-video</ref>

"Sometime Around Midnight" is played and credited during the [[Eagle Eye]] film, and "Gasoline" is part of the [[Band Hero]] video game soundtrack.

==Pitchfork Media controversy==

Upon release of The Airborne Toxic Event's self-titled 2008 album, Ian Cohen of [[Pitchfork Media]] gave the album 1.6 out of 10.0,<ref>[http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/145326-the-airborne-toxic-event-the-airborne-toxic-event Pitchfork: The Airborne Toxic Event]</ref> saying that the band succeeds in synthesizing only the worst aspects of such influences as [[Arcade Fire]], [[Interpol (band)|Interpol]], [[Bright Eyes (band)|Bright Eyes]], and [[The Strokes]]. The band released a statement saying they do not take reviews too seriously and criticized Pitchfork for basing their critiques on "a band's ability to match a certain indie rock aesthetic" rather than a band's other merits, and claiming that much of the review "reads less like a record review and more like a diatribe against a set of ill-considered and borderline offensive preconceptions about Los Angeles".<ref>[http://www.theairbornetoxicevent.com/news/open-letter-to-pitchfork-media-from-the-airborne-toxic-event.html TheAirborneToxicEvent.com - An Open Letter to Pitchfork Media from the Airborne Toxic Event, 2008]</ref>
