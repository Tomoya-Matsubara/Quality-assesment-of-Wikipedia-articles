The Earl's mother was [[Eleanor Paston]].  On 3 July 1536, he married [[Margaret Neville]], daughter of [[Ralph Neville, 4th Earl of Westmorland]], and they had three children: 
*[[Edward Manners, 3rd Earl of Rutland]]
*[[John Manners, 4th Earl of Rutland]]
*Elizabeth Manners (c. 1553 &ndash; c. 1590) she married Sir William Courtenay of Powderham Castle.

After Margaret's death, he married Bridget, the widow of [[Richard Morrison (ambassador)|Richard Morrison]]. Her third husband was [[Francis Russell, 2nd Earl of Bedford]].

Like his father, Earl Henry held many offices. As Warden of the [[Scottish Marches]] he reprieved the town of [[Haddington, East Lothian|Haddington]] in June 1549, and recaptured [[Ferniehirst Castle]].<ref>Merriman, Marcus, The ''Rough Wooings'', Tuckwell (2000), 340.</ref> Whilst anxious to return home on account of his mother's ill-health in November 1549, he was required to investigate the activities of [[Thomas Wyndham (navigator)|Thomas Wyndham]] a sailor who had captured merchant vessels in the [[Firth of Forth|Forth]]. In December 1549, his mother-in-law, the Dowager of Westmorland, complained to him that he had established a garrison of Italian soldiers at [[Bywell Castle|Bywell]], one her villages.<ref>HMC (1888), 50, 52, 53.</ref> As Captain-general of the cavalry at the [[Battle of St. Quentin (1557)|siege of St Quentin]] under [[Mary I of England]]. Under [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] he served successfully and she made him Lord Lieutenant of Nottinghamshire and [[Rutland]], Knight of the Garter and [[President of the North]]. Not long before his premature death he completed the building of [[Belvoir Castle]].

He is buried at [[Bottesford, Leicestershire|Bottesford]] Church in [[Leicestershire]]. His tomb, in the centre of the chancel next to that of his father, is of [[alabaster]] and considered unique. The effigies lie beneath a decorated example of an Elizabethan dining table on heavy carved legs, suggesting an attempt to represent a [[Eucharist|communion]] table.  Earl Henry is depicted in armour of conventional pattern except that the breast plate is made up of laminated plates. He wears a coronet and his head is supported on a tilt-heaume. He is wearing a chain nearly reaching his thighs, and the [[Order of the Garter]] is on the left leg. He holds a closed book in his right hand and a sword in his left. At his feet is a hornless [[unicorn]].  His wife, Margaret, also wears a coronet and is dressed in the style of the time, with an [[ermine]]-trimmed mantle.  Her head rests on a scroll and her feet on a lion.
