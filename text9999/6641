'''Pontiff''' or '''Pontificate''' was a title of certain religious leaders, now used principally to refer to the [[Pope]]. 

==Etymology==
The term derives from the [[French language|French]] word ''pontife'', from the [[Latin]] ''pontifex'', a title used for high priests of the [[Roman Empire]]. The word ''pontifex'' is commonly held to derive from the Latin root words ''pons'', "bridge" + ''facere'', "to do" or "to make", with a literal meaning of "bridge-builder". This, however, is disputed - it may be only a folk etymology.<ref name="oed">"Pontifex". "Oxford English Dictionary", March 2007</ref> See [[Pontifex Maximus]] for more details on the original Roman term.

==Usage in the Catholic Church==
Pontiffs were originally simply chiefs or high priests of any religion; thus writers from the 16th through to the 18th centuries referred equally to Christian pontiffs ([[bishop]]s) and "Mahometan <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Muslim]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> Pontiffs" ([[caliph]]s) or [[Swami]] ( Hindu ). Over time, however, the term became associated with the highest religious authority in the [[Catholic Church]] <U+2014> the Pope. It is often modified by an adjective - for instance, "[[Supreme Pontiff]]", "Sovereign Pontiff", "Roman Pontiff" - to distinguish the Pope from "ordinary" pontiffs.<ref name="oed" />

In the modern era, the modifying adjective is usually dropped, with the term being used exclusively to refer to the Pope, as in "The Pope visited Cuba in 1998, the first visit by a reigning pontiff to the island."
