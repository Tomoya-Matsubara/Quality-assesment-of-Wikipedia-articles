He was also a 2011 All-Big Ten honorable mention.

==Background==
Kovacs attended [[Clay High School (Oregon, Ohio)|Clay High School]], which was the rival high school of current Wolverine teammate [[Kevin Koger]].<ref name=JKTHS />  In high school, he earned [[varsity letter]]s in [[basketball]] as a sophomore and junior.  He also earned All-City recognition in [[track and field]] three times (first team as a senior, second team as a junior and honorable mention as a sophomore) and was a four-year letterman.  He qualified for the Ohio State championships in the [[4x400 meter relay]].  He was a three-year letterman in football, where he earned All-Ohio academic honors and All-district honors as both a [[wide receiver]] and [[defensive back]].<ref name=32JK/> 

He was not recruited by any [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] schools as a [[high school football]] player, but he was recruited by some [[Division II (NCAA)|Division II]] schools.<ref name=JKTHS>{{cite web|url=http://michigan.scout.com/2/912120.html|title=Jordan Kovacs Tells His Story|accessdate=2010-11-05|2009-10-22|work=GoBlueWolverine}}</ref> Kovacs only had two campus visits: [[Division II (NCAA)|Division II]] Hillsdale and [[Toledo Rockets football|Toledo]] (a school 13 miles from his high school).<ref name=FwwtfU/> By the time he completed his college applications, even Hillsdale had lost interest in him.<ref name=FwwtfU/> His father placed a call to Michigan Director of Football Operations Brad Labadie after Jordan was wait listed and got him to agree to review a homemade highlight reel.<ref name=FwwtfU/> As his graduation neared, Kovacs shook hands with Andy Boyd, a Toledo coach, on a preferred walk-on spot.<ref name=FwwtfU/>  That same afternoon in June 2008, Labadie called to confirm that Kovacs had been admitted from the wait list.<ref name=FwwtfU/>  The admission came without an athletic scholarship.<ref name=WOWJKRHRtRT/> Labadie encouraged Jordan to attend walk-on tryouts.<ref name=FwwtfU/>
