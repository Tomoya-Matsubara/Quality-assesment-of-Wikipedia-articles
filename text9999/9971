The '''Suffolk County Sheriff's Office''' is the oldest [[law enforcement agency]] in  [[Suffolk County, New York]]. The [[Sheriffs in the United States|sheriff's]] office currently employs approximately 1200 people, including 841 [[corrections officer|correction officers]], 247 deputy sheriffs, and 130 civilian personnel.<ref>[http://www.co.suffolk.ny.us/departments/sheriff.aspx Suffolk County Sheriff's Office page]</ref> Its Office and Business Operations are located at the Riverhead Correctional Facility, 100 Center Drive South in [[Riverhead, New York|Riverhead]] (although it bears the Riverhead name, it is actually south of the [[Peconic River]] in [[Riverside, Suffolk County, New York|Riverside]] in the [[Southampton (town), New York|Town of Southampton]]).

The sheriff of Suffolk County is elected to the term of four years.<ref>[http://www.co.suffolk.ny.us/Home/departments/sheriff/SOHistory.aspx Suffolk County Sheriff's Office History page]</ref>

==History==
On [[Long Island]], from 1664 to 1683 [[riding]]s were used to establish boundaries within the [[shire]]. The East riding comprised the territory now occupied by Suffolk County. The West riding consisted of [[Kings County, New York|Kings County]] and Newtown ([[Queens County, New York|Queens County]]). The remainder of Long Island belonged to the North riding. Collectively, the three ridings were called Yorkshire.

The [[List of colonial governors of New York|colonial governor of New York]] appointed a "[[High Sheriff]]" for Yorkshire with a Deputy from each riding. In 1683, the ridings were abolished and the East riding became Suffolk County. The High Sheriff was no longer necessary being that each County would now have its own Sheriff. Suffolk County<U+2019>s first Sheriff was Josiah Hobart in 1683.

After the [[American Revolution]], the practice of the Governor appointing a sheriff continued and was incorporated into the first [[New York Constitution]], adopted in 1777. At the 1821 [[Constitutional convention (political meeting)|constitutional convention]], the office of sheriff became an elective office. That year, Abraham Gardiner became Suffolk County's first elected sheriff.

==Duties==
The Sheriff's Office:
*Operates the two Suffolk County correctional facilities (in [[Yaphank, New York|Yaphank]] and Riverhead), provides county [[courthouse]] security and detention.
*Provides [[Service of process|service]] and enforcement of civil papers, [[eviction]]s and [[Warrant (law)|warrants]].
*Are responsible for patrolling and investigating all crimes committed on county-owned property such as county government office buildings and the campuses of the [[Suffolk County Community College]], as well as providing assistance to the [[Suffolk County Park Police (New York)|Suffolk County Park Police]].
*Has several specialized units, including [[Police dog|K-9]] Units, Marine Units, a [[Police diving|Dive Team]], a [[Mountain bike|Mountain Bike]] Unit, an [[All-terrain vehicle|ATV]] Unit, the Sheriff's Emergency Response Team (SERT), a tactical weapons team and a [[sniper]] section, and a Highway Patrol Division (including a [[Motorcycle]] Section), which covers all roadways in Suffolk County, answering all 911 calls for service on State Route 27 (Sunrise Hwy) from exit 37 to the Southampton Town line and Interstate Route 495 (The Long Island Expressway) from the Nassau County border to the Riverhead Town line.
Celebrating its 327th year of service to Suffolk County.

The Sheriff's Office participates in various task forces, such as the East End Drug Task Force, and the specially created [[joint task force]] with the [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] to investigate and arrest illegal immigrant gang members, the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]], [[High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area]], and the [[United States Marshals Service]], undercover assignments, and also conduct criminal investigations.


==Rank structure==
The SCSO formerly had an Undersheriff for Corrections and an Undersheriff for Law Enforcement.  Sheriff DeMarco changed that practice by appointing an undersheriff as his number two man in the department and a second undersheriff subordinate to the first.  There are also two wardens; a one star Warden and two star Warden. The one star Warden subordinate to the other.
