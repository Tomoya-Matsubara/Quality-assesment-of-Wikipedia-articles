==Early life==
Gourcuff was born on 11 July 1986 in [[Ploemeur]], [[Morbihan]], [[Brittany (administrative region)|Britanny]] to parents Marine Thalouarn and [[Christian Gourcuff]], both being [[Breton people|Breton]].<ref name="gourcuff">{{cite news |title=Yoann Gourcuff voit la vie en bleu  |url=http://www.ouest-france.fr/actu/actuDet_-Yoann-Gourcuff-voit-la-vie-en-bleu-_3639-720386_actu.Htm |work=Ouest-France |date=11 October 2008 |accessdate=12 August 2009}}</ref> Gourcuff comes from a very athletic family. His mother was a [[basketball]] player, his older brother, Erwan, is a competitive [[Swimming (sport)|swimmer]] and [[Cycling|cyclist]], while his father was a former footballer who played for several clubs in such countries as [[France]], [[Switzerland]] and [[Canada]], however, he is more known for his time at [[Stade Rennais F.C.|Rennes]], [[FC Lorient|Lorient]], and [[Le Mans Union Club 72|Le Mans]]. Gourcuff's father later moved into the [[Coach (sport)|managerial role]] having stints at Rennes, Le Mans, Lorient (twice), and [[Qatar|Qatari]] club [[Al-Gharafa Sports Club|Al-Gharafa]]. He currently serves as manager of Lorient, his third stint at the club, whom he has managed since 2003.<ref>{{cite news |title=Gourcuff, Christian|url=http://www.fclweb.fr/equipe/staff/index.php?id=5|work=FC Lorient |date=12 August 2009 |accessdate=12 August 2009}}</ref> 

As a youth, Yoann excelled at both football and [[tennis]], becoming the top player of his age group (12),<ref name="gourcuff"/> but eventually opted to focus on football.<ref name="maxifoot">{{cite news |title=Gourcuff, pr<U+00E9>nom Yohan|url=http://www.maxifoot.fr/articles/2504/index.htm|work=MaxiFoot |date=1 December 2005 |accessdate=12 August 2009}}</ref>

==Career==
===Early career===
Gourcuff began his career with [[FC Lorient]], who were, at the time, managed by his father. During his time at Lorient, he also trained at [[Ploufragan|INF Ploufragan]],<ref name="maxifoot"/> a training center comparable to that of [[Clairefontaine]]. Following his father's departure to [[Stade Rennais F.C.|Stade Rennais]], Gourcuff, who initially considered [[FC Nantes|Nantes]],<ref name="maxifoot"/> followed suit and signed an ''<U+00E9>lite'' (youth) contract with the club in 2001. While in the youth system at Rennes, he participated in the [[Coupe Gambardella]] and scored a goal in their 4<U+2013>1 demolition of [[RC Strasbourg|Strasbourg]] in the final match helping the club win the 2003 edition of the youth cup. 

As expected, Gourcuff signed his first professional contract in November 2003<ref name="maxifoot"/> and was promoted to the first team for the latter part of the [[Ligue 1 season 2003/2004|2003<U+2013>04 season]]. He made his league debut on 7 February 2004 in a 0<U+2013>2 defeat against [[AJ Auxerre|Auxerre]], coming on as a substitute in the 76<sup>th</sup> minute.<ref>{{cite news |title=Rennes v.

Wearing the number 10 shirt, he appeared in 36 matches, scoring six goals, which included his first ever league goal against [[AS Monaco FC|Monaco]] in a 2<U+2013>0 win<ref>{{cite news |title=Monaco v. Rennes Match Report |url=http://www.lfp.fr/ligue1/feuilleMatch.asp?saison=2005/2006&code_evt=D1&code_jr_tr=J07&num_ordre=6|work=Ligue Football de Professionnel |date=18 September 2005 |accessdate=12 August 2009}}</ref> He formed partnerships with fellow Frenchman [[Olivier Monterrubio]] and the [[Sweden|Swede]] [[Kim K<U+00E4>llstr<U+00F6>m]], helping Rennes to finish 7<sup>th</sup> in [[Ligue 1]] and winning them a place in the [[UEFA Intertoto Cup 2006|2006 UEFA Intertoto Cup]].

===Milan===
Having been linked with a host of big name European clubs such as [[Netherlands|Dutch]] club [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]], [[Spain|Spanish]] side [[Valencia CF|Valencia]], and [[England|English]] club [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] of the [[Premier League]]<ref>{{cite news |title=Gourcuff, pr<U+00E9>nom Yohan|url=http://www.maxifoot.fr/articles/2504/index.htm|work=MaxiFoot |date=1 December 2005 |accessdate=12 August 2009}}</ref>, at the end of the 2006 season, Gourcuff moved to [[A.C. Milan|AC Milan]] in [[Italy]]. He signed a five year contract with the transfer fee being approximately [[Euro|<U+20AC>]]3.5 million.<ref>{{cite news |title=AC Milan sign French talent Gourcuff |url=http://www.monstersandcritics.com/sport/soccer/article_1174813.php/Report_AC_Milan_sign_French_talent_Gourcuff |work=Monsters and Critics |date=22 June 2006 |accessdate=12 August 2009}}</ref> He made his competitive debut for the ''Rossoneri'' on 9 August in the club's [[2006<U+2013>07 UEFA Champions League#Third qualifying round|Champions League third qualifying round]] tie against [[Red Star Belgrade]], appearing in the 81<sup>st</sup> minute as a substitute for [[Andrea Pirlo]].<ref>{{cite news |title=AC Milan 1 - 0 Crvena Zvezda |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/match?id=204813&cc=5901 |work=ESPN |date=9 August 2006 |accessdate=12 August 2009}}</ref> He scored his first career goal for Milan in the club's opening Champions League group stage match against [[AEK Athens F.C.|AEK Athens]].<ref>{{cite news |title=AC Milan 3 - 0 AEK Athens |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/match?id=205449&cc=5901 |work=ESPN |date=23 September 2006 |accessdate=12 August 2009}}</ref>

Over the course of two years with the club, Gourcuff's playing time was effectively insufficient appearing in only 36 league matches, 23 of them as a substitute. His meager playing time and slow development at the club was primarily due to injuries<ref>{{cite news |title=Gourcuff injury blow |url=http://www.acmilan-online.com/archive/arc8-2006.php |work=AC Milan Online |date=28 August 2006 |accessdate=12 August 2009}}</ref> and manager [[Carlo Ancelotti]] overlooking and being critical of him<ref>{{cite news |title=Yoann Gourcuff Earning Zidane Comparisons |url=http://www.insidefutbol.com/2009/01/18/yoann-gourcuff-earning-zidane-comparisons/ |work=Inside Futebol |date=18 January 2009 |accessdate=12 August 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Ancelotti unsure of Gourcuff return |url=http://www.footballnewsblog.co.uk/italian-serie-a/ancelotti-unsure-of-gourcuff-return/ |work=Football News Blog |date=3 March 2009 |accessdate=12 August 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Domenech slams AC Milan boss Ancelotti over Gourcuff criticism |url=http://www.tribalfootball.com/domenech-slams-ac-milan-boss-ancelotti-over-gourcuff-criticism-242065 |work=Tribal Football |date=3 May 2009 |accessdate=12 August 2009}}</ref>, stating that the player had psychological issues.<ref>{{cite news |title=Milan chief: Kaka not for sale in the summer |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=624216&cc=5901 |work=ESPN |date=3 March 2009 |accessdate=12 August 2009}}</ref> Gourcuff was also in direct competition with the [[Brazil national football team|Brazilian international]] and [[2007 FIFA World Player of the Year]] winner [[Kak<U+00E1>]], which caused further limits in playing time. Gourcuff did, however, earn a winner's medal with the club after they won the [[2007 UEFA Champions League Final|2006<U+2013>07 edition of the Champions League]]. Though, he did not crack the starting 11 or the bench for the match, his three appearances for the club in the competition made him eligible to receive a medal. He was also a part of the squads that won the [[2007 UEFA Super Cup]] and the [[2007 FIFA Club World Cup]].<ref>{{cite news |title=AC Milan FIFA World Club Cup Squad |url=http://www.fifa.com/tournaments/archive/clubworldcup/japan2007/teams/team=1907169/index.html |work=FIFA |accessdate=12 August 2009}}</ref>

Following the season, on 31 May 2008, [[Adriano Galliani]] revealed Milan would loan Gourcuff to [[France|French]] [[Ligue 1|first division]] club [[FC Girondins de Bordeaux|Bordeaux]] for the entire [[Ligue 1 2008<U+2013>09|2008<U+2013>09 season]], to allow him more playing time.<ref>{{cite news |title=Gourcuff joins Bordeaux on loan from Milan |url=http://m.espn.go.com/soccer/story?storyId=542217&teamId=159&lang= |work=ESPN |date=3 June 2008 |accessdate=12 August 2009}}</ref>

He also provided the assist on the third goal. He scored two goals in Bordeaux's [[UEFA Champions League 2008<U+2013>09|Champions League campaign]] against [[A.S. Roma|Roma]] and [[CFR Cluj]].

==International career==
Gourcuff has been [[cap (sports)|capped]] for France at [[France national youth football team|schoolboy level]] earning his first cap at the age of 14 with the [[France national youth football team|under-15 team]]. He made 14 appearances with the [[France_national_youth_football_team#France_national_under-16_squad|under-16 squad]] scoring two goals. Due to his increased playing time with Rennes, he only made six appearances with the [[France_national_youth_football_team#France_national_under-17_squad|under-17 squad]] and, as a result, the squad failed to qualify for the [[2003 UEFA European Under-17 Football Championship]]. He returned to international level with [[France_national_youth_football_team#France_national_under-19_squad|the under-19s]] and was part of the winning team at the [[2005 European Under-19 Football Championship]]. Leading up to the tournament, Gourcuff scored goals against [[Armenia national football team|Armenia]] in the first qualifying round<ref>{{cite news |title=France 2 - 1 Armenia|url=http://www.uefa.com/competitions/under19/history/season=2005/round=1924/match=74129/index.html |work=Union of European Football Associations |date=28 September 2004 |accessdate=12 August 2009}}</ref> and [[Spain national under-19 football team|Spain]] in the Elite round.<ref>{{cite news |title=Gourcuff strike sends France through|url=http://www.uefa.com/competitions/under19/history/season=2005/round=1925/match=79821/index.html |work=Union of European Football Associations |date=16 April 2005 |accessdate=12 August 2009}}</ref> The 1<U+2013>0 victory over Spain assured France's qualification for the tournament. In the tournament, Gourcuff scored an impressive [[hat-trick]] in a 3<U+2013>1 victory over [[Norway national football team|Norway]] converting two [[Penalty shot|penalty kicks]] and scoring in the run of play.<ref>{{cite news |title=Gourcuff spot on for France|url=http://www.uefa.com/competitions/under19/history/season=2005/round=1926/match=81129/index.html|work=Union of European Football Associations |date=20 July 2005 |accessdate=12 August 2009}}</ref> He assisted on two goals in their 3<U+2013>2 semi-final win over [[Germany_national_under-19_football_team#Germany_National_Under-19_Squad|Germany]] and played the full 90 minutes in championship match against [[England national under-19 football team|England]].

Gourcuff was a regular in the [[France national under-21 football team|under-21 team]] making 18 appearances and scoring four goals, but never got the chance to participate in a [[UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship]] as France missed out on both times he was eligible losing in the playoffs.
