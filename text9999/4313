==History==
{{main|Construction of Mount Rushmore}}
[[Image:MtRushmore sculpting.jpg|250px|thumb|left|The carving of Mount Rushmore involved the use of [[dynamite]], followed by the process of "honeycombing".<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/archive/moru/park_history/carving_hist/workers.htm Honeycombing process explained from nps.gov]</ref> About two million tons of rock were blasted off the mountainside. ]]
Originally known to the [[Lakota people|Lakota]] [[Sioux]] as ''Six Grandfathers'', the mountain was renamed after [[Charles E. Rushmore]], a prominent [[New York]] lawyer, during an expedition in 1885.<ref>Belanger, Ian A. ''et al.'' [http://t3.preservice.org/T0211461/history/ Mt. Rushmore- presidents on the rocks].{{dead link|date=October 2008}} URL accessed on March 13, 2006.</ref> At first, the project of carving Rushmore was undertaken to increase tourism in the [[Black Hills]] region of South Dakota. After long negotiations involving a [[United States Congress|Congressional]] delegation and President [[Calvin Coolidge]], the project received Congressional approval. The carving started in 1927, and ended in 1941 with some injuries and no fatalities.<ref name=NPSfacts/>

As ''Six Grandfathers'', the mountain was part of the route that Lakota leader [[Black Elk]] took in a spiritual journey that culminated at [[Harney Peak]]. Following a series of [[Indian Wars#Plains|military campaigns]] from 1876 to 1877, the United States asserted control over the area, a claim that is still disputed based on the 1868 [[Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868)|Treaty of Fort Laramie]] (see ''Controversy'' below). Among white American settlers, the peak was known variously as Cougar Mountain, Sugarloaf Mountain, Slaughterhouse Mountain, and Keystone Cliffs. It was named Mount Rushmore during a prospecting expedition by Rushmore, David Swanzey (whose wife [[Carrie Ingalls|Carrie]] was the sister of author [[Laura Ingalls Wilder]]), and Bill Challis.<ref name=KAHS>Keystone Area Historical Society [http://www.keystonechamber.com/kahs/characters.html Keystone Characters] (accessed October 3, 2006).</ref>

Historian [[Doane Robinson]] conceived the idea for Mount Rushmore in 1923 to promote [[Tourism in the United States|tourism]] in South Dakota. In 1924, Robinson persuaded sculptor [[Gutzon Borglum]] to travel to the Black Hills region to ensure that the carving could be accomplished. Borglum had been involved in sculpting the [[Stone Mountain#carving|Confederate Memorial Carving]], a massive [[bas-relief]] memorial to [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] leaders on [[Stone Mountain]] in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], but was in disagreement with the officials there.<ref name=Carving>[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/rushmore/peopleevents/e_stonemtn.html People and Events : The Carving of Stone Mountain], PBS (accessed August 8, 2008).</ref> The original plan was to perform the carvings in [[granite]] pillars known as the [[Needles (Black Hills)|Needles]]. However, Borglum realized that the eroded Needles were too thin to support sculpting. He chose Mount Rushmore, a grander location, partly because it faced southeast and enjoyed maximum exposure to the sun. Borglum said upon seeing Mount Rushmore, "America will march along that skyline."<ref name="autogenerated1">[http://www.nps.gov/archive/moru/park_history/carving_hist/carving_history.htm Carving History] (October 2, 2004).

''Mount Rushmore'' (May 2003). ISBN 0-9646798-5-X, the standard scholarly study.</ref>

Between October 4, 1927, and October 31, 1941, Gutzon Borglum and 400 workers sculpted the colossal 60-foot (18 m) carvings of [[President of the United States|U.S. presidents]] [[George Washington]], [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[Theodore Roosevelt]], and [[Abraham Lincoln]] to represent the first 150 years of American history. These presidents were selected by Borglum because of their role in preserving the Republic and expanding its territory.<ref name="autogenerated1" /><ref name="autogenerated2">[[Albert Boime]], "Patriarchy Fixed in Stone: Gutzon Borglum's 'Mount Rushmore'," ''American Art'', Vol. 5, No. 1/2. (Winter - Spring, 1991), pp. 142<U+2013>67.</ref> The image of Thomas Jefferson was originally intended to appear in the area at Washington's right, but after the work there was begun, the rock was found to be unsuitable, so the work on the Jefferson figure was dynamited, and a new figure was sculpted to Washington's left.<ref name="autogenerated1" />

In 1933, the National Park Service took Mount Rushmore under its jurisdiction. Engineer [[Julian Spotts]] helped with the project by improving its infrastructure. For example, he had the tram upgraded so that it could reach the top of Mount Rushmore for the ease of workers. By July 4, 1934, Washington's face had been completed and was dedicated.  The face of Thomas Jefferson was dedicated in 1936, and the face of Abraham Lincoln was dedicated on September 17, 1937. In 1937, a bill was introduced in Congress to add the head of civil-rights leader [[Susan B. Anthony]], but a [[rider (legislation)|rider]] was passed on an appropriations bill requiring that federal funds be used to finish only those heads that had already been started at that time.<ref name=timeline>[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/rushmore/timeline/timeline2.html American Experience] "Timeline: Mount Rushmore" (2002). URL accessed on March 20, 2006.</ref> In 1939, the face of Theodore Roosevelt was dedicated.

[[Image:Gutzon Borglum's model of Mt. Rushmore memorial.jpg|280px|thumb|left|A model at the site depicting Mount Rushmore's intended final design. Insufficient funding forced the carving to end in October 1941.]]
The Sculptor's Studio<U+2014>a display of unique plaster models and tools related to the sculpting<U+2014>was built in 1939 under the direction of Borglum. Borglum died from an [[embolism]] in March 1941. His son, [[Lincoln Borglum]], continued the project. Originally, it was planned that the figures would be carved from head to waist,<ref>[http://www.engineeringsights.org/SightDetail.asp?Sightid=526&id=SD&view=s&name=South+Dakota&page=1&image=0 Mount Rushmore National Memorial]. </ref> but insufficient funding forced the carving to end.<ref name="autogenerated1" />  Borglum had also planned a massive panel in the shape of the [[Louisiana Purchase]] commemorating in eight-foot-tall gilded letters the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]], Louisiana Purchase, and seven other territorial acquisitions from [[Alaska purchase|Alaska]] to [[Texas Annexation|Texas]] to the [[Panama Canal Zone]].<ref name="autogenerated2" />

The entire project cost US$989,992.32.<ref name=SDTourism>[http://iml.jou.ufl.edu/projects/students/Ahmann/rushmore.html Mount Rushmore National Memorial]. Tourism in South Dakota. Laura R. Ahmann.

On October 15, 1966, Mount Rushmore was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. An essay from [[Nebraska]] student William Andrew Burkett, selected as the winner for the college-age group in 1934, was placed on the Entablature on a bronze plate in 1973.<ref name=timeline>See above</ref> In 1991, President [[George H. W. Bush]] officially dedicated Mount Rushmore.

In a canyon behind the carved faces is a chamber, cut only {{convert|70|ft|m|0}} into the rock, containing a vault with sixteen porcelain enamel panels.  The panels include the text of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, biographies of the four presidents and Borglum, and the history of the U.S.  The chamber was created as the entranceway to a planned "Hall of Records"; the vault was installed in 1998.<ref>{{cite web

Ten years of redevelopment work culminated with the completion of extensive visitor facilities and sidewalks in 1998, such as a Visitor Center, Museum, and the Presidential Trail. Maintenance of the memorial annually requires mountain climbers to monitor and seal cracks.  The memorial is not cleaned to remove [[lichens]].  It has been cleaned only once.

==Controversy==
[[Image:Air Force One over Mt. Rushmore.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Air Force One]] flying over Mt. Rushmore]]
Mount Rushmore is controversial among [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]]s because the United States seized the area from the [[Lakota people|Lakota]] tribe after the [[Great Sioux War of 1876-77]]. The [[Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868)|Treaty of Fort Laramie]] from 1868 had previously granted the Black Hills to the Lakota in perpetuity. The Lakota consider the hills sacred, although historians believe the Lakota also gained control of the hills by force, displacing the [[Cheyenne]] in 1776.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/08/13/earlyshow/series/americanvacation/main3161494.shtml |title=Jack's Journal: Mount Rushmore, The Rich History Of The Black Hills: On The Road With "The Great American Vacation" |accessdate=2008-08-08 |work=cbsnews.com |publisher=CBS Interactive }}</ref> Members of the [[American Indian Movement]] led an [[occupation (protest)|occupation]] of the monument in 1971, naming it "Mount Crazy Horse". Among the participants were young activists, grandparents, children and Lakota holy man John Fire [[Lame Deer]], who planted a prayer staff atop the mountain. Lame Deer said the staff formed a symbolic shroud over the presidents' faces "which shall remain dirty until the treaties concerning the Black Hills are fulfilled."<ref name=Glass>Matthew Glass, "Producing Patriotic Inspiration at Mount Rushmore," ''Journal of the American Academy of Religion'', Vol. 62, No. 2. (Summer, 1994), pp. 265<U+2013>283.</ref>

In 2004, the first Native American superintendent of the park was appointed. Gerard Baker has stated that he will open up more "avenues of interpretation", and that the four presidents are "only one avenue and only one focus."<ref name=Native>[http://www.indiancountry.com/content.cfm?id=1096409995 First American Indian heads shrine to democracy],{{dead link|date=October 2008}} Indian Country Today. Accessed on April 3, 2006</ref>

The [[Crazy Horse Memorial]] is being constructed elsewhere in the Black Hills to commemorate a famous Native American leader and as a response to Mount Rushmore. It is intended to be larger than Mount Rushmore and has the support of Lakota chiefs; the Crazy Horse Memorial Foundation has rejected offers of [[U.S. Government|federal]] funds. However, this memorial is likewise the subject of controversy, even within the Native American community.<ref>Lame Deer, John (Fire) and Richard Erdoes.  ''Lame Deer Seeker of Visions''.

In 2009, author Ivan Eland released ''Recarving Rushmore: Ranking the Presidents on Peace, Prosperity, and Liberty'', a book that advocates a reappraisal of the greatness of three of the four presidents on the monument.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFFmEBmRSb8|title=Part 1: 04/04/2009 Ron Paul interviews Ivan Eland on Recarving Rushmore CSPAN|work=CSPAN|author=Paul, Rob|date=April 4, 2009}}</ref>

==Ecology==
[[Image:Black Hills, Mount Rushmore National Park.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Black Hills]] opposite Mount Rushmore]]
The flora and fauna of Mount Rushmore are similar to those of the rest of the Black Hills region of South Dakota. Birds including the [[Turkey Vulture|turkey vulture]], [[Bald Eagle|bald eagle]], [[hawk]], and [[meadowlark]] fly around Mount Rushmore, occasionally making [[Bird nest|nesting spots]] in the ledges of the mountain. Smaller birds, including songbirds, [[nuthatch]]es, and [[woodpecker]]s, inhabit the surrounding pine forests. Terrestrial mammals include the [[mouse]], [[chipmunk]], [[squirrel]], [[skunk]], [[porcupine]], [[raccoon]], [[beaver]], [[badger]], [[coyote]], [[Bighorn Sheep|bighorn sheep]], and [[bobcat]]. In addition, several species of [[frog]]s and [[snake]]s inhabit the region. The two brooks in the memorial, the Grizzly Bear and Starling Basin brooks, support fish such as the [[Dace|longnose dace]] and the [[brook trout]].<ref name=animal>[http://www.nps.gov/archive/moru/pphtml/animals.html Nature & Science- Animals] National Park Service. URL accessed on April 1, 2006.</ref> Some endemic animals are not indigenous to the area; the [[mountain goat]]s are descended from goats which were a gift from Canada to [[Custer State Park]] in 1924 but later escaped.<ref name=FloraFauna>[http://www.americanparknetwork.com/parkinfo/ru/flora/index.html Mount Rushmore- Flora and Fauna]. American Park Network. URL accessed on March 16, 2006.</ref>

At lower elevations, [[pinophyta|coniferous]] trees, mainly the [[Ponderosa Pine|Ponderosa pine]], surround most of the monument, providing shade from the sun. Other trees include the [[bur oak]], the [[Spruce|Black Hills spruce]], and the [[cottonwood]]. Nine species of shrubs live near Mount Rushmore. There is also a wide variety of wildflowers, including especially the [[Antirrhinum|snapdragon]], [[sunflower]], and [[Violet (plant)|violet]]. Towards higher elevations, plant life becomes sparser.<ref name=FloraFauna /> However, only approximately five percent of the plant species found in the Black Hills are indigenous to the region.<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/archive/moru/pphtml/plants.html Nature & Science- Mount Rushmore]. National Park Service. URL accessed on March 13, 2006.</ref>

Though the area receives about {{convert|18|in|mm}} of precipitation on average per year, alone it is not enough to support the abundant animal and plant life. Trees and other plants help to control [[surface runoff]]. Dikes, seeps, and springs help to dam up water that is flowing downhill, providing watering spots for animals. In addition, stones like [[sandstone]] and [[limestone]] help to hold [[groundwater]], creating [[aquifer]]s.<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/archive/moru/pphtml/subnaturalfeatures25.html Nature & Science- Groundwater]. National Park Service. URL accessed on April 1, 2006.</ref>

[[Forest fire]]s occur in the Ponderosa forests surrounding Mount Rushmore around every 27 years. This was determined from fire scars in tree core samples. These help to clean forest debris located on the ground. Large conflagrations are rare, but have occurred in the past.<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/archive/moru/pphtml/subnaturalfeatures32.html Nature & Science- Forests]. National Park Service. URL accessed on April 1, 2006.</ref>

==Geology==
[[Image:Mt rushmore 07 27 2005.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Mt. Rushmore, showing the full size of the mountain and the [[scree]] of debris from construction.]]
Mount Rushmore is largely composed of [[granite]]. The memorial is carved on the northwest margin of the [[Harney Peak]] granite [[batholith]] in the Black Hills of South Dakota, so the geologic formations of the heart of the Black Hills region are also evident at Mount Rushmore. The batholith [[magma]] intruded into the pre-existing [[mica]] [[schist]] rocks during the [[Precambrian]] period about 1.6 billion years ago.<ref name="autogenerated3">[http://www.nps.gov/archive/moru/pphtml/subenvironmentalfactors13.html Geologic Activity]. National Park Service.</ref> However, the uneven cooling of the molten rock caused the formation of both fine and coarse-grained minerals, including [[quartz]], [[feldspar]], [[muscovite]], and [[biotite]]. Fractures in the granite were sealed by [[pegmatite]] [[dike (geology)|dikes]]. The light-colored streaks in the presidents' foreheads are due to these dikes. 

The Black Hills granites were exposed to [[erosion]] during the late Precambrian, but were buried by [[sandstone]]s and other sediments during the [[Cambrian]] Period. The area remained buried throughout the [[Paleozoic]] Era, but was exposed again to erosion during the [[Plate tectonics|tectonic]] uplift about 70 million years ago.<ref name="autogenerated3" /> The Black Hills area was uplifted as an elongated geologic dome which towered some {{convert|20000|ft|m}} above sea level, but erosion wore the area down to only {{convert|4000|ft|m}}.<ref>Irvin, James R. [http://www.holoscenes.com/gallery5.html Great Plains Gallery] (2001). URL accessed on March 16, 2006.</ref> The subsequent natural erosion of this mountain range allowed the carvings by stripping the granite of the overlying sediments and the softer adjacent schists. The contact between the granite and darker schist is viewable just below the sculpture of Washington.

Borglum selected Mount Rushmore as the site for several reasons. The rock of the mountain is composed of smooth, fine-grained granite. The durable granite erodes only {{convert|1|in|mm}} every 10,000 years, indicating that it was sturdy enough to support sculpting.<ref name="autogenerated1" /> In addition, it was the tallest mountain in the region, looming to a height of {{convert|5725|ft|m}} above sea level.<ref name=peakbagger /> Because the mountain faces the southeast, the workers also had the advantage of sunlight for most of the day.

==Tourism==
[[Image:Rushmoreentrance.jpg|right|200px|thumb|The entrance to the site]]
Tourism is South Dakota's second-largest industry, and Mount Rushmore is its top tourist attraction. In 2004, over two million visitors traveled to the memorial.<ref name=NPSfacts /> The site is also home to the final concerts of Rushmore Music Camp and attracts many visitors over the week of the [[Sturgis Motorcycle Rally]]. 

The '''Lincoln Borglum Museum''' is located in the memorial. It features two 125-seat theaters that show a 13-minute movie about Mount Rushmore. One of the best viewpoints is located at Grandview Terrace, above the Museum. The Presidential Trail, a walking trail and boardwalk, starts at Grandview Terrace and winds through the [[Ponderosa Pine|Ponderosa pine]] forests to the Sculptor's Studio, providing close-up views of the memorial. The Sculptor's studio was built by [[Gutzon Borglum]], and features discussion about the construction of the monument as well as the tools used. The amphitheater also has a 30-minute program at dusk that describes the construction of the memorial. Following that, the mountain is illuminated for two hours.<ref>[http://www.ohranger.com/mount-rushmore Park Overview] American Park Network. URL accessed on April 1, 2006.</ref>
