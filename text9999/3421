'''Trondhjemite''' is a leucocratic (light-colored) [[intrusive]] [[igneous rock]]. It is a variety of [[tonalite]] in which the [[plagioclase]] is mostly in the form of [[oligoclase]]. Trondhjemites are sometimes known as plagiogranites.

Trondhjemite is common in [[Archean]]  [[terrane]]s occurring in conjunction with tonalite and [[granodiorite]] as the ''TTG'' (tonalite-trondhjemite-granodiorite) ortho[[gneiss]] suite. Trondhjemite [[Dike (geology)|dikes]] also commonly form part of the [[sheeted dyke complex|sheeted dike complex]] of an [[ophiolite]].
