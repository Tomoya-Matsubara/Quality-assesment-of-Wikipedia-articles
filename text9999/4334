"'''Song Beneath the Song'''" (also known as '''''Grey's Anatomy'': The Music Event''') is the eighteenth episode of the [[Grey's Anatomy (season 7)|seventh season]] of the American medical drama ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'', and the one-hundred and fourty-fourth episode overall. It was named after a song by American singer [[Maria Taylor]]. Written by series creator [[Shonda Rhimes]] and directed by [[Tony Phelan]], it premiered on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in the United States on March 31, 2011. It is the series' first musical episode, and features the cast performing songs previously featured within the program. It is accompanied by a [[soundtrack album]], ''Grey's Anatomy: The Music Event'', also released on March 31, 2011.

The episode revolves around [[Callie Torres]] and [[Arizona Robbins]], just after they engage in a vehicular collision. Various songs are performed by the cast members, as they attempt to save the life of Torres. Rhimes originally idealized the episode at the conception of the drama, while the show remained untitled. The episode opened to mix reviews from television critics, and it was the second most watched program of the night. "Song Beneath the Song" was ranked in several "best and worst" lists, and the soundtrack was included on the [[Billboard 200]].

==Plot==
En-route to a weekend breakaway, surgeons [[Arizona Robbins]] ([[Jessica Capshaw]]) and [[Callie Torres]] ([[Sara Ram<U+00ED>rez]]) are involved in a vehicular collision, moments after Robbins proposes marriage. Torres suffers severe injuries, which endanger her life and her unborn child. She and Robbins are taken to Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital, the institute at which they both work. Their colleagues attempt to save Torres, while Robbins and [[Mark Sloan (Grey's Anatomy)|Mark Sloan]] ([[Eric Dane]]), the father of Torres' baby, stand by. Torres' many injuries include neurological trauma. While barely conscious, she hallucinates an uninjured version of herself standing beside her. The hallucinatory Torres begins to sing, and is gradually joined by the doctors treating her. This singing continues throughout the episode, as Torres' projection of herself attempts to reach out to Robbins.

Torres goes into [[cardiac arrest]] and is taken into theatre, where she is temporarily stabilized, pending further surgery. She is moved into [[intensive care]], while neonatal surgeon [[Addison Montgomery]] ([[Kate Walsh (actress)|Kate Walsh]]) is flown in by helicopter in case the baby has to be delivered prematurely. Robbins and Sloan argue over Torres treatment; Robbins believes that Torres would not risk endangering the baby, but Sloan argues for saving Torres at all costs. The [[Attending physician|attending]] surgeons devise a treatment plan, led by trauma surgeon [[Owen Hunt]] ([[Kevin McKidd]]). As they do so, Torres dreams about the moments preceding the accident. Her dream self sings to Robbins, interspersed with shots of the hospital staff singing and dancing with their own partners. Hunt's wife [[Cristina Yang]] ([[Sandra Oh]]) suggests treating Torres with a high-risk but potentially effective [[Cardiothoracic surgery|cardiothoracic procedure]] she learned from her old mentor, [[Preston Burke]] ([[Isaiah Washington]]). Her current mentor, [[Teddy Altman]] ([[Kim Raver]]), refuses to perform it, but when Torres' condition deteriorates and she is rushed back into theatre, Hunt agrees that Yang should attempt the procedure.

When Torres again goes into cardiac arrest, Montgomery delivers her daughter at twenty-three weeks gestation. The baby is not initially able to breathe, so with Sloan's support, Robbins steps in and is able to revive her. Across the operating room, Torres' condition begins to improve. Once the surgery is complete, the doctors deal with their own affairs; Sloan's former partner [[Lexie Grey]] ([[Chyler Leigh]]) commits to her new relationship with resident [[Jackson Avery]] ([[Jesse Williams (actor)|Jesse Williams]]); Lexie's sister [[Meredith Grey]] ([[Ellen Pompeo]]) confesses that she was jealous of Torres' pregnancy, which prompts her husband [[Derek Shepherd]] ([[Patrick Dempsey]]) to promise that they will have a child together; Altman tells Yang that she can no longer teach her; Sloan and Robbins bond over their shared parenthood. Later, as Robbins keeps a vigil by Torres' bedside, the hallucinatory Torres is able to rouse her recovering self. As she regains consciousness, Torres accepts Robbins' proposal.

==Production==
===Conception===
Since ''Grey's Anatomy'' began, series creator [[Shonda Rhimes]] had planned to produce a musical episode. She first vocalized the idea during filming of the pilot episode, when the program was as yet untitled.<ref name="GM">{{cite web|url=http://www.greyswriters.com/2011/03/shonda-rhimes-on-song-beneath-the-song.html|title=Shonda Rhimes on "Song Beneath The Song"...|last=Rhimes|first=Shonda|authorlink=Shonda Rhimes|date=March 31, 2011|work=Grey Matter|publisher=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]|accessdate=April 12, 2011}}</ref> Rhimes felt that seasons [[Grey's Anatomy (season 6)|six]] and [[Grey's Anatomy (season 7)|seven]] were the right time for the crew to "try anything and everything [they had] always wanted to do," and explained that she "finally [had] the right idea and the right talent to make [a musical episode] happen."<ref name="TVG">{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Greys-Shonda-Rhimes-1025983.aspx|title=Exclusive: Shonda Rhimes Reveals Grey's Anatomy Musical Details|last=Abrams|first=Natalie|date=November 22, 2010|work=[[TV Guide]]|accessdate=March 25, 2011}}</ref> Filming began seven and a half years after Rhimes initially raised the idea.<ref name="GM"/> Though cast member Dempsey jokingly referred to the episode as ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]] M.D.'',<ref name="WK">{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Kecks-Exclusives-Greys-1030106.aspx|title=Keck's Exclusives: Grey's Musical Goes Back to Its Roots|last=Keck|first=William|date=February 28, 2011|work=[[TV Guide]]|accessdate=March 26, 2011}}</ref> Rhimes intended for it to differ from other [[:Category:Musical television episodes|musical television episodes]].<ref name="TVG"/> She called it the opposite of "[[Once More, with Feeling (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Once More, with Feeling]]", the "all-out, show-stopping," musical episode of ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', as she aimed to "do something that was musical without being a musical." <ref name="TVG"/>

Rhimes said she has difficulty getting the network's permission. She added: "I begged the studio people. I begged the network people. I took these people to dinner and begged. I jumped out at these people in bathrooms and begged. And they all smiled politely but what they were clearly really thinking was, 'This woman is an idiot.'"<ref name=GM/> Rhimes also explains why it took so long to produce this episode: {{cquote|Explaining what the heck took us so long is too complicated to go into here.
