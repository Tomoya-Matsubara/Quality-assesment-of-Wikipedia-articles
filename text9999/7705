The triangle contains three red maple leaves on one stem over a white background. A gold helmet with a veil of red and white maple leaves sits on top of the shield, upon which stands a crowned lion holding a red maple leaf, with a larger crown over its head. On the right is a lion rampant flying the Union Flag. On the left is a unicorn wearing a gold chain from a crown collar, flying a blue flag with three fleurs-de-lis. Both animals hold a red ribbon that goes around the shield, which says "desiderantes meliorem patriam". Below the animals and shield is a blue scroll inscribed with the motto "A mari usque ad mare", which sits on a wreath of flowers.

'''Canada''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|<U+02C8>|k|<U+00E6>|n|<U+0259>|d|<U+0259>}}) is a country in northern [[North America]], extending from the [[Atlantic Ocean]] in the east to the [[Pacific Ocean]] in the west and northward into the [[Arctic Ocean]]. It is the world's second largest [[List of countries and outlying territories by total area|country by total area]]. Canada's [[Canada<U+2013>United States border|common border]] with the [[United States]] to the south and northwest is the longest in the world.

The land that is now Canada was inhabited for millennia by various groups of [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Aboriginal peoples]]. Beginning in the late 15th century, [[British colonization of the Americas|British]] and [[French colonization of the Americas|French]] expeditions explored, and later settled, along the Atlantic coast. France ceded nearly all of [[New France|its colonies in North America]] in 1763 after the [[Seven Years' War]]. In 1867, with the union of three [[British North America]]n colonies through [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]], Canada was formed as a [[federalism|federal]] [[British Dominions|dominion]] of four provinces.<ref name=AoC-dominion>{{cite web| title = Territorial evolution| work = Atlas of Canada | publisher = Natural Resources Canada | url =http://atlas.nrcan.gc.ca/site/english/maps/reference/anniversary_maps/terr_evol | format = html/PDF | accessdate = 2007-10-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| title = Canada: History| work = Country Profiles | publisher = Commonwealth Secretariat | url =http://www.thecommonwealth.org/YearbookInternal/145152/history/ | format = html/PDF| accessdate = 2007-10-09}}</ref> This began an [[Territorial evolution of Canada|accretion of provinces and territories]] and a process of increasing autonomy from the [[United Kingdom]]. This widening autonomy was highlighted by the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]] of 1931 and culminated in the [[Canada Act 1982|Canada Act]] of 1982, which severed the vestiges of legal dependence on the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British parliament]].

A [[federation]] consisting of [[Provinces and territories of Canada|ten provinces and three territories]], Canada is governed as a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary democracy]] and a [[constitutional monarchy]] with [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] as its [[head of state]]. It is a [[Official bilingualism in Canada|bilingual]] nation with both [[Canadian English|English]] and [[Canadian French|French]] as official languages at the federal level. One of the world's [[developed country|highly developed countries]], Canada has a diversified economy that is reliant upon its abundant natural resources and upon trade<U+2014>particularly with the United States, with which Canada has had a [[Canada<U+2013>United States relations|long and complex relationship]]. It is a member of the [[G8]], [[G-20 major economies|G-20]], [[NATO]], [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]], [[World Trade Organisation|WTO]], [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie|Francophonie]], [[Organisation of American States|OAS]], [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation|APEC]], and [[United Nations|UN]].

== Etymology ==
{{Main|Name of Canada}}<!--Please see the talk page before editing or reverting this to specify which (of several) languages produced the word Canada. There are differences of opinion, which may be best discussed at the main article Name of Canada-->

The name ''Canada'' comes from a [[St. Lawrence Iroquoians|St. Lawrence Iroquoian]] word, ''kanata'', meaning "village" or "settlement".<ref name=origin>{{cite web|title=Origin of the Name, Canada|url=http://www.pch.gc.ca/pgm/ceem-cced/symbl/o5-eng.cfm|publisher=Canadian Heritage (Government of Canada)|year=2008|accessdate=2010-06-27}}</ref> In 1535, indigenous inhabitants of the present-day [[Quebec City]] region used the word to direct French explorer [[Jacques Cartier]] towards the village of [[Stadacona]].<ref name="maura"/> Cartier later used the word ''Canada'' to refer not only to that particular village, but also the entire area subject to [[Donnacona]] (the chief at Stadacona); by 1545, European books and maps had begun referring to this region as ''Canada''.<ref name="maura">{{cite journal|last=Maura|first=Juan Francisco|year=2009|title=Nuevas aportaciones al estudio de la toponimia ib<U+00E9>rica en la Am<U+00E9>rica Septentrional en el siglo XVI|journal=Bulletin of Spanish Studies|publisher=Routledge|volume=86|issue=5|pages=577<U+2013>603|doi=10.1080/14753820902969345|ref=harv}}</ref>

From the early 17th century onwards, that part of [[New France]] that lay along the [[Saint Lawrence River]] and the northern shores of the [[Great Lakes]] was known as ''Canada''.  The area was later split into two British colonies, [[Upper Canada]] and [[Lower Canada]].  They were re-unified as the [[Province of Canada]] in 1841.<ref>{{cite book

Combined, the term ''Dominion of Canada'' was in common usage until the 1950s.<ref name="buckner"/> As Canada asserted its political autonomy from the [[United Kingdom]], the federal government increasingly used simply ''Canada'' on state documents and treaties, a change that was reflected in the renaming of the national holiday from [[Dominion Day]] to [[Canada Day]] in 1982.<ref name="buckner">{{cite book|title=Canada and the British Empire|editor=Phillip Buckner|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2008|pages=37<U+2013>40, 56<U+2013>59, 114, 124<U+2013>125|isbn=019927164X}}</ref>

Canada is a federation composed of ten [[province]]s and three [[territory (administrative division)|territories]]. In turn, these may be [[List of regions of Canada|grouped into regions]]: [[Western Canada]], [[Central Canada]], [[Atlantic Canada]], and [[Northern Canada]] (the latter made up of the three territories: Yukon, Northwest Territories, and Nunavut). [[Eastern Canada]] refers to Central Canada and Atlantic Canada together. Provinces have [[Canadian federalism|more autonomy]] than territories. The provinces are responsible for most of Canada's social programs (such as [[Health care in Canada|health care]], [[Education in Canada|education]], and [[welfare (financial aid)|welfare]]) and together collect more revenue than the federal government, an almost unique structure among federations in the world. Using its spending powers, the federal government can initiate national policies in provincial areas, such as the [[Canada Health Act]]; the provinces can opt out of these, but rarely do so in practice. [[Equalization payments]] are made by the federal government to ensure that reasonably uniform standards of services and taxation are kept between the richer and poorer provinces.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/11-516-x/sectionh/4057752-eng.htm|title=Government Finance|last=Bird|first=Richard M|date=2008-10-22|work=Historical Statistics of Canada|publisher=Statistics Canada|accessdate=2010-03-17}}</ref>
