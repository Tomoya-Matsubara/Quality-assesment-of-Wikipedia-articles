'''Peter Charles Archibald Ewart Jennings''', [[Order of Canada|CM]] (July 29, 1938 &ndash; August 7, 2005) was a [[Canadian-American]] [[journalist]] and [[news anchor]]. He was the sole anchor of [[ABC World News Tonight|ABC's ''World News Tonight'']] from 1983 until his death in 2005 of complications from [[lung cancer]]. A high-school dropout, he transformed himself into one of American television's most prominent journalists.

Jennings started his career early, hosting a Canadian radio show at the age of nine. In 1965, [[ABC News]] tapped him to anchor its flagship evening news program. His inexperience marred his first short stint in the anchor chair, and Jennings became a foreign correspondent in 1968, honing his reporting skills in the [[Middle East]]. 

He returned as one of ''World News Tonight'''s three anchors in 1978, and was promoted to the role of sole anchor in 1983. Jennings formed part of the "Big Three" news anchors who dominated American evening news in the 1980s and 1990s. In addition to anchoring, Jennings hosted several news specials and moderated presidential debates. Having always been fascinated with the United States, Jennings became a naturalized United States citizen in 2003. His death, which closely followed the retirements of [[Tom Brokaw]] and [[Dan Rather]], marked the end of the "Big Three" era.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Jennings was born in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]]; he and his younger sister Sarah were children of Elizabeth Osborne and [[Charles Jennings (journalist)|Charles Jennings]], a prominent radio broadcaster for the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] (CBC). Peter Jennings started his broadcasting career at the age of nine, hosting ''Peter's People'', a half-hour, Saturday morning, CBC Radio show for kids. His father was on a business trip to the Middle East when the show debuted; upon returning, Charles Jennings, who harbored a deep dislike of [[nepotism]], was outraged to learn that the network had put his son on the air.<ref name=GlobeAndMailObit>Martin, Sandra (August 9, 2005).

When he was 11, Jennings started attending [[Trinity College School]] in [[Port Hope]], Ontario, where he excelled in sports. After the CBC moved his father to its [[Ottawa]] headquarters in the early 1950s, Jennings transferred to [[Lisgar Collegiate Institute]].<ref name=GlobeAndMailObit /> He struggled academically, and Jennings later surmised that it was out of "pure boredom" that he failed 10th grade and dropped out.

Although Jennings dreamed of following in his father's footsteps in broadcasting, his first job was as a bank teller for the [[Royal Bank of Canada]]. He had hoped that the company would assign him to its [[Havana]] branch; instead, it located him in the small town of [[Prescott, Ontario|Prescott]], Ontario, before transferring him to its nearby [[Brockville, Ontario|Brockville]] branch.<ref name=GlobeAndMailObit /> During this time, he explored acting by appearing in several amateur musical productions with the [[Orpheus Musical Theatre Society]], including ''[[Damn Yankees]]'' and ''[[South Pacific (musical)|South Pacific]]''.<ref name=OrpheusAlumni>"[http://www.orpheus-theatre.on.ca/members-only/alumni.html Where are they now?]".

It was in Brockville that the 21-year-old Jennings started his rise in broadcasting. In 1959, [[CFJR-FM|CFJR]], a local radio station, hired him as a member of its news department; many of his stories, including his coverage of a local train wreck, were picked up by the CBC.<ref name=CBCInDepth>[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] News Online.

When the station launched in March 1961, Jennings was initially an interviewer and co-producer for ''Vue'', a late-night news program. His producers saw a youthful attractiveness in him that resembled that of [[Dick Clark]], and Jennings soon found himself hosting ''Club Thirteen'', a dance show similar to ''[[American Bandstand]]''.<ref name=OttawaCitizenObit>Ward, Bruce (August 9, 2005).

Jennings started reporting for ABC at its New York [[news bureau]].<ref name=WashPost /> At the time, ABC lagged behind the more established news divisions of [[NBC]] and [[CBS]], and the network was trying to attract younger viewers. On February 1, 1965, ABC plucked the fresh-faced Canadian from the field and placed him at the anchor desk of ''Peter Jennings With the News'', then a 15-minute nightly newscast. He replaced [[Ron Cochran]], a fellow Canadian.<ref name=GlobeAndMailObit /> At 26, Jennings was, and remains, the youngest-ever U.S. network news anchor.<ref name=IndependentObit>Glass, Charles (August 9, 2005).

An inexperienced Jennings had a hard time keeping up with his rivals at the other networks, and he could not compete with the venerable newscasts of [[Walter Cronkite]] at CBS and [[Chet Huntley]] and [[David Brinkley]] at NBC. American audiences disliked Jennings' [[Canadian English|Canadian]] accent. He pronounced lieutenant as "leftenant", mangled the pronunciation of "[[Appomattox Campaign|Appomattox]]," and misidentified the [[Marines' Hymn]] as [[Anchors Aweigh]] at [[Lyndon Johnson]]'s presidential inauguration; his general ignorance of American affairs and culture led critics to deride Jennings as a "glamorcaster".<ref name=GlobeAndMailObit /> "It was a little ridiculous when you think about it," he later reflected.

Jennings was determined to build his journalism credentials abroad. In 1968, he established ABC's Middle East bureau in [[Beirut]], [[Lebanon]], the first American television news bureau in the Arab world.<ref name=ABCBio>"[http://abcnews.go.com/WNT/story?id=126542 Peter Jennings]".

He conducted the first American television interview with [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] chairman [[Yasser Arafat]].<ref name=WashPost /> While stationed in the Lebanese capital, Jennings dated Palestinian activist [[Hanan Ashrawi]], who was then a graduate student in literature at the [[American University in Beirut]].<ref name=USNewsAshrawi>Fenyvesi, Charles (December 30, 1991 / January 6, 1992).

In 1972, Jennings covered his first major breaking news story, the [[Munich Massacre|Munich Olympics massacre]] of Israeli athletes by Black September. His live reporting, which drew on the expertise he had acquired in the Middle East, provided context for Americans who were unfamiliar with the Palestinian group. By hiding with his camera crew close to the athletic compound where the Israeli athletes were being held hostage, Jennings was able to provide ABC with clear video of the masked hostage-takers.<ref name=GlobeAndMailObit /> He would later be criticized for insisting on using the terms "guerillas" and "commandos" instead of "terrorists" to describe the members of Black September.<ref name=NatRevMunich>Friedman, Rachel Zabarkes (July 26, 2004).

After the events of Munich, Jennings continued to report on Middle East issues. In 1973, he covered the [[Yom Kippur War]], and the following year, he served as chief correspondent and co-producer of ''Sadat: Action Biography'', a profile of Egyptian president [[Anwar Sadat]] that would win him his first of two [[George Foster Peabody Award]]s.<ref name=GlobeAndMailObit /> The documentary established Jennings as Sadat's favorite correspondent.<ref name=MuseumTV>Waite, Clayland.

''AM America'' debuted on January 6, 1975, with Jennings delivering regular five-minute newscasts from Washington.

Meanwhile, ABC News and its newly installed president, [[Roone Arledge]], were preparing an overhaul of its nightly news program, whose [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] had languished in third place behind CBS and NBC since its inception. In the late 1970s, a disastrous pairing of [[Harry Reasoner]] and [[Barbara Walters]] at the anchor desk left the network searching for new ideas. Arledge decided to implement a three-anchor format for the program. On July 10, 1978, ''[[World News with Charles Gibson|World News Tonight]]'' debuted with [[Frank Reynolds]] in Washington, [[Max Robinson]] in Chicago, and Jennings in [[London]].<ref name=NewsweekWNT>Waters, Harry F. with Betsy Carter (August 20, 1979).

Jennings also found renewed success in his personal life. In 1979, he married for the third time to fellow ABC correspondent [[Kati Marton]]. That same year, he became a father when Marton gave birth to their daughter, Elizabeth. In 1982, Jennings' and Marton's second child, Christopher, was born.<ref name=USATodayTimeline />

As part of ABC's triumvirate, Jennings continued to cover major international news, especially Middle East issues.

His insistence on covering the major international stories himself irked some of his fellow ABC foreign correspondents, who came to resent being scooped by what they deemed as "Jennings' Flying Circus."<ref name=GlobeAndMailObit /> Jennings, too, was not completely satisfied with his job in London. When his contract expired with ABC in the early 1980s, Jennings flirted with the possibility of moving back to Canada and working with the CBC on its new nightly newscast, ''[[The Journal (Canadian TV show)|The Journal]]''.

===Sole anchor===
In 1983, Reynolds fell ill with [[multiple myeloma]], a type of leukemia/lymphoma that often attacks the bones, and was forced to stop anchoring in April. His absence caused a dip in the ratings for ABC's nightly newscast. ABC originally expected a full recovery, and relocated Jennings to its Washington bureau to fill in for Reynolds while he was sick; the move helped buoy the newscast's ratings, although it remained in third place.

Jennings would anchor the program from [[New York City]], the program's new base of operations.<ref name=WashPost1983 /> The announcement signaled a generational shift in the evening news broadcasts, and the beginning of what the media would deem the "Big Three" era of Jennings, [[Dan Rather]] of CBS, and [[Tom Brokaw]] of NBC.<ref name=NYTimesObit /> Rather had already been elevated to anchor in 1981 after the retirement of Walter Cronkite, and Brokaw of ''[[NBC Nightly News]]'' was set to become sole anchor the same day as Jennings. At the time, Jennings expressed apprehension that the impending competition among the three newsmen was at risk of becoming superficial. "With me, Brokaw and Rather, I recognize that there will be the factor of three pretty faces," he said. "That's an inevitable byproduct of television.

He was noted for questioning General [[Wesley Clark]] over Clark's silence over controversial comments made by liberal filmmaker [[Michael Moore]], a supporter of Clark. Moore called then-President [[George W. Bush]] a "[[deserter]]".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950CE0DF1E39F930A15752C0A9629C8B63&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all|title=At the Debate, Speculations and Calculations Focus on Dean |last=Tierney|first=John|date=2004-01-23|work=The New York Times|accessdate=2009-02-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cjr.org/politics/peter_jennings_vs_wesley_clark.php|title=Peter Jennings vs. Wesley Clark vs. Michael Moore vs. George W.

By late 2004, Brokaw had retired from his anchoring duties at NBC, ceding the reins to [[Brian Williams]]; Rather planned to step down in March 2005. Jennings and ABC saw an opportunity to gain viewers, and initiated a publicity blitz touting the anchor's foreign reporting experience. However, despite having almost always reported from the scene of any major news story, Jennings was sidelined by an [[Upper respiratory tract infection|upper respiratory infection]] in late December 2004; he was forced to anchor from New York during the aftermath of the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake|Asian tsunami]], while his competitors traveled to the region. For Jennings, the situation was agonizing.<ref name=NYTimesTsunami>Steinberg, Jacques (January 10, 2005).

In late March, viewers started noticing that Jennings' voice sounded uncharacteristically gravelly and unhealthy during evening newscasts. On April 1, 2005, he anchored ''World News Tonight'' for the last time; his poor health also prevented him from covering the [[Funeral of Pope John Paul II|death and funeral of Pope John Paul II]]. On April 5, 2005, Jennings informed viewers through a taped message on ''World News Tonight'' that he had been diagnosed with [[lung cancer]], and was starting [[chemotherapy]] treatment the following week.
