'''Sucralose''' is a zero-calorie [[sugar substitute]] artificial sweetener.  In the European Union, it is also known under the [[E number]] (additive code) '''E955'''. Sucralose  is approximately 600 times as [[Sweetness|sweet]] as [[sucrose]] (table sugar),<ref name=Friedman>Michael A. Friedman, Lead Deputy Commissioner for the FDA, [http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~lrd/fr980403.html Food Additives Permitted for Direct Addition to Food for Human Consumption; Sucralose] Federal Register: 21 CFR Part 172, Docket No. 87F-0086, April 3, 1998</ref> twice as sweet as [[saccharin]], and 3.3 times as sweet as [[aspartame]].  Unlike aspartame, it is stable under heat and over a broad range of [[pH]] conditions and can be used in baking or in products that require a longer shelf life.   The commercial success of sucralose-based products stems from its favorable comparison to other low calorie sweeteners in terms of taste, stability, and safety.<ref>[http://www.ffcr.or.jp/zaidan/FFCRHOME.nsf/pages/e-kousei-sucra A Report on Sucralose from the Food Sanitation Council], The Japan Food Chemical Research Foundation</ref>

Sucralose is normally added to foods in very small quantities.  Bulked-up products designed for domestic use with a similar appearance to granular sugar are sold under the names [[Splenda]] and SucraPlus.

==History==
Sucralose was discovered in 1976 by scientists from [[Tate & Lyle]], working with researchers Leslie Hough and Shashikant Phadnis at [[Queen Elizabeth College]] (now part of [[King's College London]]).<ref name="kon">[http://www.kon.org/urc/frank.html Sucralose: An Overview], by Genevieve Frank, Penn State University</ref> On a late-summer day, Phadnis was told to test the powder. Phadnis thought that Hough asked him to ''taste'' it, so he did.<ref name="kon"/>  He found the compound to be exceptionally sweet (the final formula was 600 times as sweet as sugar). They worked with Tate & Lyle for a year before settling down on the final formula.

Sucralose was first approved for use in [[Canada]] in 1991.  Subsequent approvals came in [[Australia]] in 1993, in [[New Zealand]] in 1996, in the [[United States]] in 1998, and in the [[European Union]] in 2004.  As of 2008, it had been approved in over 80 countries, including [[Mexico]], [[Brazil]], [[China]], [[India]] and [[Japan]].<ref>[http://www.splenda.com/page.jhtml?id=splenda/newspromotions/press/safety.inc Splenda No Calorie Sweetener Fact Sheet], splenda.com</ref>

==Production==
Tate & Lyle manufactures sucralose at a plant in [[McIntosh, Alabama]], with additional capacity under construction in [[Jurong|Jurong, Singapore]].  It is manufactured by the selective chlorination of sucrose (table sugar), in which three of the [[hydroxyl group]]s are replaced with [[chlorine]] atoms to produce sucralose.  In May 2008, [[Fusion Nutraceuticals]] launched a brand called SucraPlus to compete against Tate & Lyle's Splenda. Sucralose is now also manufactured in India using the same technology as described in Tate & Lyle's now-expired patents.

==Product uses==
Sucralose can be found in more than 4,500 food and beverage products.  It is used because it is a no-calorie sweetener, does not promote dental caries,<ref>{{cite journal | title = Food labeling: health claims; dietary noncariogenic carbohydrate sweeteners and dental caries. | author = Food and Drug Administration | journal = Federal Register | year = 2006 | volume = 71 | issue = 60 | pages = 15559<U+2013>15564}}</ref> and is safe for consumption by diabetics.<ref>Facts About Sucralose, American Dietetic Association, 2006.</ref> Sucralose is used as a replacement for, or in combination with, other artificial or natural sweeteners such as [[aspartame]], [[acesulfame potassium]] or [[high-fructose corn syrup]]. Sucralose is used in products such as [[candy]], [[breakfast]] bars and [[soft drink]]s.  It is also used in canned fruits wherein water and sucralose take the place of much higher calorie corn syrup based additives. Sucralose mixed with [[maltodextrin]] or [[dextrose]] (both made from corn) as bulking agents is sold internationally by [[McNeil Nutritionals]] under the Splenda brand name. In the United States and Canada, this blend is increasingly found in restaurants, including [[McDonald's]], [[Tim Hortons]] and [[Starbucks]], in yellow packets, in contrast to the blue packets commonly used by aspartame and the pink packets used by those containing [[saccharin]] sweeteners; though in Canada yellow packets are also associated with the SugarTwin brand of [[cyclamate]] sweetener.

===Cooking===
Sucralose is a highly heat-stable artificial sweetener, allowing it to be used in many recipes with little or no sugar. Sucralose is available in a granulated form that allows for same-volume substitution with sugar. This mix of granulated sucralose includes fillers, all of which rapidly dissolve in liquids.{{Fact|date=January 2009}} Unlike sucrose which dissolves to a clear state, sucralose suspension in clear liquids such as water results in a cloudy state. For example, [[gelatin]] and [[fruit preserves]] made with sucrose have a satiny, near jewel-like appearance, whereas the same products made with sucralose (whether cooked or not) appear translucent and marginally glistening.{{Fact|date=January 2009}} While the granulated sucralose provides apparent volume-for-volume sweetness, the texture in baked products may be noticeably different. Sucralose is non-[[hygroscopic]], meaning it does not attract moisture, which can lead to baked goods that are noticeably  drier and manifesting a less dense texture than baked products made with sucrose. Unlike sucrose which melts when baked at high temperatures, sucralose maintains its granular structure when subjected to dry, high heat (e.g., in a {{convert|350|<U+00B0>F|<U+00B0>C}} oven). Thus, in some baking recipes, such as [[cr<U+00E8>me br<U+00FB>l<U+00E9>e]], which require sugar sprinkled on top to partially or fully melt and crystallize, substituting sucralose will not result in the same surface texture, crispness, or crystalline structure.

==Packaging and storage==
Pure sucralose is sold in bulk, but not in quantities suitable for individual use, although some highly concentrated sucralose-water blends are available online, using 1/4 tsp per 1 cup of sweetness or roughly 1 part sucralose to 2 parts water.<ref>Sweetzfree  is a clear liquid syrup base, highly concentrated, and made from 100% pure Sucralose in a purified water concentrate.</ref> Pure dry sucralose undergoes some decomposition at elevated temperatures. When it is in solution or blended with maltodextrin, it is slightly more stable.

Most products that contain sucralose add fillers and additional sweetener to bring the product to the approximate volume and texture of an equivalent amount of sugar. This is because sucralose is nearly 600 times as sweet as sucrose (table sugar).

==Health and safety regulation==
{{Double image stack|right|sucrose2.png|sucralose2.png|150|Comparison of the chemical structures of sucrose (top) and sucralose (bottom).}}
Sucralose has been accepted by several national and international food safety regulatory bodies, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Joint Food and Agriculture Organization/World Health Organization Expert Committee on Food Additives, The European Union's Scientific Committee on Food, Health Protection Branch of Health and Welfare Canada and Food Standards Australia-New Zealand (FSANZ).  Sucralose is the only artificial sweetener ranked as "safe" by the consumer advocacy group [[Center for Science in the Public Interest]].<ref>''[http://www.cspinet.org/new/pdf/additives.pdf Nutrition Action Health Letter]'', Center for Science in the Public Interest, May 2008</ref><ref>[http://www.cspinet.org/new/200804291.html Which additives are safe? Which aren't?], Center for Science in the Public Interest</ref> According to the Canadian Diabetes Association, the amount of sucralose that can be consumed on a daily basis over a person<U+2019>s lifetime without any adverse effects is 15&nbsp;mg/kg/day.<ref>[http://www.diabetes.ca/cpg2003/chapters.aspx?table1acceptabledailyintakeofsweeteners.htm Diabetes.ca Acceptable daily intake of sweeteners]</ref>  No safety data was provided for amounts over this limit.

<U+201C>In determining the safety of sucralose, the FDA reviewed data from more than 110 studies in humans and animals. Many of the studies were designed to identify possible toxic effects including carcinogenic, reproductive and neurological effects. No such effects were found, and FDA's approval is based on the finding that sucralose is safe for human consumption.<U+201D><ref>[http://vm.cfsan.fda.gov/~lrd/tpsucral.html FDA Talk Paper T98-16]</ref>  For example, McNeil Nutritional LLC studies submitted as part of its U.S. FDA Food Additive Petition 7A3987, indicated that "in the 2-year rodent [[bioassays]]...there was no evidence of [[carcinogenic]] activity for either sucralose or its hydrolysis products...."<ref>[http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~lrd/fr980403.html FDA Final Rule, Food Additives Permitted for Direct Addition to Food for Human Consumption; Sucralose]</ref>

==Public health and safety concerns==

Results from over 100 animal and clinical studies in the FDA approval process unanimously indicated a lack of risk associated with sucralose intake.<ref name="kon"/>  However, some adverse effects were seen at doses that significantly exceeded the estimated daily intake (EDI), which is 1.1 mg/kg/day.<ref name="Baird">{{cite journal | author = Baird, I. M., Shephard, N. W., Merritt, R. J., & Hildick-Smith, G. | year = 2000 | title = Repeated dose study of sucralose tolerance in human subjects | journal = Food Chemical Toxicology | volume = 38 (Supplement 2)| pages = S123<U+2013>S129. | doi = 10.1016/S0278-6915(00)00035-1}}</ref>  When the EDI is compared to the intake at which adverse effects are seen, known as the highest no adverse effects limit (HNEL), at 1500&nbsp;mg/kg/day,<ref name="Baird"/> there is a large margin of safety.  The bulk of sucralose ingested is not absorbed by the [[gastrointestinal]] tract and is directly excreted in the feces, while 11-27% of it is absorbed.<ref name=Friedman/> The amount that is absorbed from the GI tract is largely removed from the blood stream by the kidneys and eliminated in the urine with 20-30% of the absorbed sucralose being metabolized.<ref Name=Friedman/> 

=== Thymus ===
Some concern has been raised about the effect of sucralose on the [[thymus]].  A report from the Australian National Industrial Chemicals Notification and Assessment Scheme (NICNAS) cites two studies on rats, both of which found "a significant decrease in mean thymus weight" at high doses.<ref name="NICNAS">[http://www.nicnas.gov.au/publications/car/new/NA/NAFULLR/NA0900FR/NA944FR.pdf Report from NICNAS, The Australian Government regulator of industrial chemicals (PDF document)]</ref>  The sucralose dose which caused the effects was 3000&nbsp;mg/kg/day for 28 days.  For a 150 lb (68.2&nbsp;kg) human, this would mean an intake of nearly 205 grams of sucralose a day, which is equivalent to more than 17,200 individual Splenda packets/day for approximately one month.  The dose required to provoke ''any'' immunological response was 750&nbsp;mg/kg/day,<ref>USFDA Department of Health and Human Services, 1998</ref> or 51 grams of sucralose per day, which is nearly 4,300 Splenda packets/day.  After evaluation of this data and other toxicological fidings, the NICNAS report concludes that sucralose does not pose a hazard to public health.<ref name="NICNAS"/>

=== Environmental effects ===
According to one study, sucralose is digestible by a number of microorganisms and is broken down once released into the environment.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Biodegradation of sucralose in samples of natural environments | author = Labare, Michael P.; Alexander, Martin | journal = Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry | year = 1993 | volume = 12 | issue = 5 | pages = 797<U+2013>804 | doi = 10.1897/1552-8618(1993)12[797:BOSACC]2.0.CO;2}}</ref> However, measurements by the Swedish Environmental Research Institute have shown that [[wastewater treatment]] has little effect on sucralose, which is present in wastewater effluents at levels of several <U+03BC>g/L.<ref>[http://www.naturvardsverket.se/upload/02_tillstandet_i_miljon/Milj%C3%B6gifter/sukralos_ivl_08.pdf Measurements of Sucralose in the Swedish Screening Program 2007, Part I; Sucralose in surface waters and STP samples<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> There are no known eco-toxicological effects at such levels, but the [[Swedish Environmental Protection Agency]] warns that there may be a continuous increase in levels if the compound is only slowly degraded in nature.<ref>[http://www.naturvardsverket.se/sv/Tillstandet-i-miljon/Miljogifter/Organiska-miljogifter/Sa-sprids-miljogifter-i-miljon/Sotningsmedel-sprids-till-miljon/ S<U+00F6>tningsmedel sprids till milj<U+00F6>n - Naturv<U+00E5>rdsverket<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

=== Organochlorides ===
Sucralose belongs to a class of compounds known as [[organochloride]]s (or chlorocarbons).  Some organochlorides, particularly those that accumulate in fatty tissues, are toxic to plants or animals, including humans.<ref>[http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/safety/healthcare/handbook/Chap06.pdf Solid Organochlorine Insecticides]</ref>  Sucralose, however, is not known to be toxic in small quantities and is extremely insoluble in fat; it cannot accumulate in fat like chlorinated [[hydrocarbon]]s. In addition, sucralose does not break down or dechlorinate.<ref>Daniel JW, Renwick AG, Roberts A, Sims J. The metabolic fate of sucralose in rats. ''Food Chem Tox.'' 2000;38(S2): S115-S121.</ref>  Also, a variety of a simple chlorinated hydrocarbons including dichloromethane, chloroform, and carbon tetrachloride have been isolated from marine algae. <ref>[http://www.eurochlor.org/index.asp?page=97 Natural organochlorines in living organisms: chlorinated compounds, biosynthesized<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name="Gribble">{{cite journal | title = Naturally Occurring Organohalogen Compounds | author = Gordon W.

=== Other potential effects ===
A Duke university study found evidence that high doses of Splenda (up to 1000&nbsp;mg/kg) reduced the amount of good bacteria in the intestines of rats by up to 50%, increases the pH level in the intestines, contributes to increases in body weight and affects the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in the body in such a way that crucial health-related drugs could be rejected.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Abou-Donia MB, El-Masry EM, Abdel-Rahman AA, McLendon RE, Schiffman SS |title=Splenda alters gut microflora and increases intestinal p-glycoprotein and cytochrome p-450 in male rats |journal=J.

One report suggests sucralose is a possible trigger for some migraine patients.<ref>{{cite journal | url = http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1526-4610.2006.00543_1.x | journal = Journal of Head and Face Pain | month = September | year = 2006 | doi = 10.1111/j.1526-4610.2006.00543_1.x | title = Popular Sweetner Sucralose as a Migraine Trigger | author = Patel, Rajendrakumar M. | volume = 46 | pages = 1303}}</ref> Another study published in the ''Journal of Mutation Research'' linked doses of sucralose equivalent to 11,450 packets per day in a person to DNA damage in mice.<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=12160896&dopt=Abstract Journal of Mutation Research - August 2002]</ref>

Allergic reactions to sucralose have not been documented, but individuals sensitive to either [[maltodextrin]] or [[dextrose]] should consult a physician about using any sweeteners containing these fillers.

==Natural alternatives==
Critics of sucralose often favor natural alternatives, including [[xylitol]], [[maltitol]], [[thaumatin]], [[isomalt]], [[stevia]] and [[siraitia]].  However, some natural substances{{Vague|which natural substances?|date=April 2009}} are alleged to cause other potential problems,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lynch BS, Tischler AS, Capen C, Munro IC, McGirr LM, McClain RM |title=Low digestible carbohydrates (polyols and lactose): significance of adrenal medullary proliferative lesions in the rat |journal=Regul.
