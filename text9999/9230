[[Image:Massacre of the Chinese at Rock Springs b.jpg|thumb|300px|right|An illustration of the massacre from an 1885 issue of ''[[Harper's Weekly]]''.]]
The '''Rock Springs Massacre''' (also known as the '''Rock Springs Riot''') occurred on [[September 2]], [[1885]] in the present-day U.S. city of [[Rock Springs, Wyoming]], in [[Sweetwater County]]. The riot, between Chinese immigrant miners and white, mostly immigrant, miners, was the result of racial tensions and an ongoing labor dispute over the [[Union Pacific Coal Department]]'s policy of paying Chinese miners lower wages than white miners. When the rioting ended, 28 Chinese miners were dead and 15 were wounded. Rioters burned 75 Chinese homes resulting in about $150,000 property damage. 

Tension between [[Caucasian race|whites]] and [[Chinese immigration to the United States|Chinese immigrants]] in the late 19th century [[American West]] was particularly high, especially in the decade preceding the violence. The massacre in Rock Springs was the violent outburst of years of anti-"[[coolie]]" sentiment in the [[United States]]. The 1882 [[Chinese Exclusion Act]] suspended Chinese immigration for ten years, but not before thousands of immigrants came to the American West. Most Chinese immigrants to [[Wyoming Territory]] took jobs with the railroad at first, but many ended up employed in coal mines owned by the [[Union Pacific Railroad]]. As Chinese immigration increased, so did anti-Chinese sentiment from whites. The [[Knights of Labor]], one of the foremost voices against Chinese immigrant labor, formed a chapter in Rock Springs in 1883, and most rioters were members of that organization. No connection was ever established between the riot and the national Knights of Labor organization.<ref name=nrhp/>

In the immediate aftermath of the riot, [[United States Army|federal troops]] were deployed in Rock Springs. The troops escorted the surviving Chinese miners, most of whom had fled to [[Evanston, Wyoming]], back to Rock Springs a week after the riot. Reaction came swiftly from the era's publications. In Rock Springs, the local newspaper endorsed the outcome of the riot, while in other Wyoming newspapers, support for the riot was limited to sympathy for the causes of the white miners. The massacre in Rock Springs touched off a wave of anti-Chinese violence, especially in the [[Puget Sound]] area of [[Washington Territory]]. Rioting and mob actions broke out in [[Seattle]], [[Tacoma]], and [[Issaquah, Washington]], in the months following the Rock Springs Massacre.

==Background==
[[Image:Chinese-child.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Chinese immigration to the United States|Chinese immigrant]] child, c. 1900. Chinese children were rare, and not typical of late 19th and early 20th century Chinese immigrants, who were overwhelmingly male.]]
[[Chinese immigration to the United States|Chinese immigration]] to the [[USA]] was not uniform or widespread. J.R. Tucker, writing for ''[[The North American Review]]'' in 1884, stated that the vast majority of the nearly 100,000 Chinese immigrants resided within the [[American West]]: [[California]], [[Nevada]], [[Oregon]], and [[Washington Territory]].<ref name=tucker>Tucker, "Race Progress in the United States", p. 163.</ref> The U.S. Minister to [[China]], [[George Seward]], had asserted similar numbers in ''[[Scribner's Magazine]]'' five years earlier.<ref name=seward>"Seward's 'Chinese Immigration'", pg 957.</ref> 

The first jobs Chinese laborers took in Wyoming were on the railroad, working for the [[Union Pacific Railroad|Union Pacific company]] (UP) as [[right-of-way (railroad)|maintenance&ndash;of&ndash;the&ndash;way]] workers.<ref name=uw/> Chinese workers soon became an asset to Union Pacific and were found along UP lines and in UP coal mines from [[Laramie, Wyoming|Laramie]] to Evanston. Most Chinese workers in Wyoming ended up working in [[Sweetwater County]], but a large number settled in [[Carbon County, Wyoming|Carbon County]] and [[Uinta County]]. Most or all Chinese people in the area were men working in the mine.<ref>The 1870 census showed that in Uinta and Sweetwater Counties, which at the time ran from the Utah&ndash;Colorado border to the [[Montana Territory]] border, the 96 Chinese "laborers" living there were miners; there were no other occupations listed for the Chinese nor were there any Chinese females.</ref><ref name=uw/> [[Racism]] against Chinese immigrants was widespread and largely uncontroversial at the time. J.R. Tucker, in the aforementioned 1884 article, referred to Asian immigrants as "...the Asiatic race, alien in blood, habits, and civilization." He also noted, "Chinese are the chief element in this Asiatic population."

In 1874&ndash;1875, after labor unrest disrupted coal production, the Union Pacific Coal Department hired Chinese laborers to work in their coal mines throughout southern Wyoming. Even so, Chinese population rose slowly at first; however, where there were Chinese immigrants, they were generally concentrated in one area.<ref name=larson/><ref name=gardner/> At Red Desert, a remote section camp in Sweetwater county, there were 20 inhabitants, of whom 12 were Chinese. All 12 were laborers who worked under an American foreman. To the east of Red Desert was another remote section camp, Washakie. An American section foreman lived there amongst 23 others, including 13 Chinese laborers and an Irish crew foreman.<ref name=gardner/> In the various section camps along the main line of the Union Pacific Railroad, Chinese workers far outnumbered any other nationality.<ref name=gardner/> Though the 79 Chinese in Sweetwater county in 1870 represented only 4% of the total population, they were, again, concentrated. In Rock Springs and Green River, the largest towns along the UP line, there were no Chinese residents reported in 1870.<ref name=gardner/>

Throughout the 1870s, the Chinese population in Sweetwater County and all of Wyoming steadily increased. During the decade, Wyoming's total population rose from 9,118 to 20,789.<ref name=WYcensus/> In the 1870 [[U.S. Census]], what the government today calls "Asian and Pacific Islander" represented only 143 members of the population of Wyoming. The increase during the decade 1870&ndash;1880 was the largest percentage increase in the Asian population of Wyoming of any decade since; the increase represented a 539% jump in the Asian population.<ref name=WYcensus/> By 1880, most Chinese residents in Sweetwater County lived in Rock Springs. At that time, Wyoming was home to 914 "Asians;" that number fell significantly in the years 1880&ndash;1890, to 465.<ref name=WYcensus>Historic Wyoming Census (1870&ndash;1990)</ref>

[[Image:Chinese camp rock springs.JPG|thumb|right|A typical 19th century [[Chinese-American|Chinese&ndash;American]] mining camp.]]
Although most Chinese workers in 1880 were employed in the [[coal mine]]s around Wyoming and Sweetwater County, the Chinese in Rock Springs worked mostly in occupations outside of mining. In addition to Chinese laborers and miners, a professional gambler, a priest, a cook, and a barber resided in the city.<ref name=gardner/> In [[Green River, Wyoming]], there was a Chinese doctor. Chinese servants and waiters found work in Green River and in [[Fort Washakie]]. In [[Atlantic City, Wyoming]], [[Miner's Delight, Wyoming]], and Red Canyon, Wyoming, Chinese gold miners were employed. However, the majority of the 193 Chinese residing in Sweetwater County by 1880 worked in the coal mines or on the railroad.<ref name=gardner>Gardner, ''Wyoming and the Chinese''</ref>

==Causation==
The riot was the result of a combination of race prejudice and general resentment against Union Pacific.<ref name=larson/> In 1882, the [[Chinese Exclusion Act]] required that "&hellip;from and after the expiration of ninety days next after the passage of this act, and until the expiration of ten years next after the passage of this act, the coming of Chinese laborers to the United States be, and the same is hereby, suspended; and during such suspension it shall not be lawful for any Chinese laborer to come."<ref name=exclusion>Chinese Exclusion Act, 1882.</ref> In the years preceding the Rock Springs Massacre, the importation of Chinese labor was seen as a "system worse than slavery."<ref name=nyt5>''The New York Times,'' "Labor Meeting at Buffalo".</ref> The white miners at Rock Springs felt that Chinese laborers, in accepting lower wages, drove wages down for the white miners, comprised of mostly [[Sweden|Swedish]], [[Wales|Welsh]], [[Ireland|Irish]] and [[Cornwall|Cornish]].<ref name=saxton2>Saxton, ''The Rise and Fall of the White Republic'', p. 310.</ref><ref name=stone1/><ref name=nyt12>''The New York Times,'' "The Rock Springs Massacre", pg 1.</ref><ref name=nyt13>''The New York Times,'' "The Chinese Must Leave".</ref><ref name=max>Max, "Not the Chinese, but the Land&ndash;Thieves", pg 4.</ref><ref name=sherwin>Shewin, "Observations on the Chinese Laborer", pg 91.</ref>

According to a deposition taken by the [[Qing Dynasty|Chinese government]] and signed by 559 Chinese from Rock Springs, the Chinese there knew of ill&ndash;will from the white miners. They had never taken any precautions, as no prior events led them to believe a race riot would be the end result.<ref name=daniels/> Underlying the outbreak of violence were racism and resentment of the policies of the Union Pacific Coal Department. Until 1875, the mines in Rock Springs were worked by whites; in that year, a strike occurred, and the strikers were replaced with Chinese [[strikebreaker]]s less than two weeks after the strike began.<ref name=larson/> The company resumed [[mining]] with 50 white miners and 150 Chinese miners in its employ. As more Chinese arrived in Rock Springs, bitterness from the white miners increased.<ref name=larson/> At the time of the massacre, there were about 150 white miners and 331 Chinese miners in Rock Springs.<ref name=larson/>

In the two years before the massacre, a "Whitemen's Town" was established in Rock Springs.<ref name=tothis/> By 1883, the Knights of Labor organized a chapter in Rock Springs. The Knights were one group that spearheaded opposition to Chinese labor during the 1880s;<ref name=nrhp/><ref name=stone1/> in 1882, the Knights had worked for the passage of the Chinese Exclusion Act.<ref name=nrhp/> Even so, the Rock Springs Massacre and the exclusion of Chinese workers were not the most significant events in the history of the Knights of Labor.<ref name=armentrout/> There is no proof that the national Knights of Labor organization was behind the massacre at Rock Springs, but the group's strong anti&ndash;Chinese position was weakened as a result of the riot.<ref name=nrhp/> In August 1885, notices were posted from Evanston to Rock Springs, Wyoming, demanding the expulsion of Chinese immigrants, and on the evening of [[September 1]], [[1885]], one day before the violence, white miners in Rock Springs held a meeting regarding the Chinese immigrants. It was rumored that threats were made that night against the Chinese, according to the immigrants who were living there.<ref name=tothis>"History Matters", ''To This We Dissented''.</ref>

==Massacre==
[[Image:Editorial, harpers weekly 1885.jpg|thumb|right|This 1885 editorial cartoon by [[Thomas Nast]] depicts the Rock Springs Riot.]]
At 7:00 a.m. on [[September 2]], [[1885]], ten white men, in ordinary garb and miner's uniforms, arrived at coal pit number six at the Rock Springs mine. They declared that the Chinese laborers had no right to work in a particularly desirable "room" in the mine; miners were paid by the ton, so it was important where in the mine one worked.<ref name=daniels>Daniels, ''Asian America'', pp. 61&ndash;63.</ref> A fight broke out, and two Chinese workers at pit number six were badly beaten. The white miners, most of whom were members of the [[Knights of Labor]], then walked out of the mine.<ref name=nrhp/> 

After the work stoppage at pit number six, more white miners assembled near the town. They marched to Rock Springs by way of the railroad, carrying firearms.<ref name=tothis/> At about 10:00 a.m., the bell in the Knights of Labor meeting hall tolled, and the miners inside the building joined the group, which by this time had grown quite large.<ref name=saxton/> There were white miners who opted to go to saloons instead of joining the gathering mob, but by 2:00 p.m., the saloons and grocers were persuaded by a Union Pacific official to close.<ref name=daniels/>

With the saloons and grocers closed, the mob of 150 men, armed with [[Winchester rifle]]s, moved toward [[Chinatown]] in Rock Springs.<ref name=nrhp/><ref name=daniels/> The mob moved in two groups and entered Chinatown by crossing separate bridges. The larger group entered by way of the railroad bridge and was divided into squads, a few of which remained standing on the opposite side of the bridge outside Chinatown. The smaller group entered by way of the town's plank bridge.<ref name=tothis/>

Squads from the larger group broke off and moved up the hill toward coal pit number three. One squad took up a position at the pit number three coal shed; another, at the [[pump house]]. The first gunshots were fired by the squad at the pump house, according to Chinese miners' claims, followed by a volley from those at the coal shed. Lor Sun Kit, a Chinese laborer, was shot and fell to the ground, but the Chinese did not flee the scene.<ref name=tothis/>

As the group at coal pit number three rejoined the mob, the crowd pressed on toward Chinatown, some men firing their weapons as they went.<ref name=tothis/> The smaller group of white miners at the plank bridge divided itself into squads and surrounded Chinatown. One squad stayed at the plank bridge to cut off any Chinese escape.<ref name=tothis/> As the white miners moved into Chinatown, the Chinese became aware of the riot and that two Chinese, Leo Dye Bah and Yip Ah Marn, residents from the west and east sides of Chinatown, had already been killed. As the news of the murders spread, the Chinese fled in fear and confusion. They ran in every direction: up the hill behind coal pit number three; others, along the base of the hill at coal pit number four; others still, from the eastern end of town, fled across [[Bitter Creek (Wyoming)|Bitter Creek]] to the opposite hill; and more fled the western end of Chinatown across the base of the hill to the right of coal pit number five. The mob came from three directions by this time, from the east and west ends of town and from the wagon road.<ref name=tothis/> The Chinese immigrants present at the Rock Springs Massacre presented their own grisly account of the [[m<U+00EA>l<U+00E9>e]] to the Chinese [[consul]] in [[New York City|New York]]: 

<blockquote>"Whenever the mob met a Chinese they stopped him and, pointing a weapon at him, asked him if he had any revolver, and then approaching him they searched his person, robbing him of his watch or any gold or silver that he might have about him, before letting him go. Some of the rioters would let a Chinese go after depriving him of all his gold and silver, while another Chinese would be beaten with the butt ends of the weapons before being let go. Some of the rioters, when they could not stop a Chinese, would shoot him dead on the spot, and then search and rob him. Some would overtake a Chinese, throw him down and search and rob him before they would let him go. Some of the rioters would not fire their weapons, but would only use the butt ends to beat the Chinese with. Some would not beat a Chinese, but rob him of whatever he had and let him go, yelling to him to go quickly. Some, who took no part either in beating or robbing the Chinese, stood by, shouting loudly and laughing and clapping their hands."<ref name=tothis/></blockquote>

The massacre was in full swing by a little past 3:30 p.m.<ref name=tothis/> The women in Rock Springs had gathered in a group at the plank bridge, where they stood and cheered the rampage on. Two women present even fired shots at the Chinese.<ref name=tothis/> As the riot wore on into the night, the Chinese miners scattered into the hills, lying in the grass to hide. Between four and nine p.m., rioters set fire to the camp houses belonging to the coal company. By nine p.m., all but one Chinese camp house was burned completely. In all, 79 Chinese homes were destroyed by fire.<ref name=tothis/> Damage to Chinese&ndash;owned property was estimated at around $147,000.<ref name=nrhp/><ref name=larson>Larson, ''History of Wyoming'', Pg. 141&ndash;144.</ref><ref name=daniels/>

Of the Chinese killed, some died on the banks of Bitter Creek as they fled, and others were murdered near the railroad bridge as they attempted to escape Chinatown.<ref name=tothis/> The rioters threw Chinese bodies into the flames of burning buildings.<ref name=tothis/> Other Chinese immigrants, who had hid in their houses instead of fleeing, were murdered, and then their bodies were burned with their houses.<ref name=saxton/> Even sick Chinese were not spared, as those who could not run were burned alive in their camp houses.<ref name=tothis/><ref name=daniels/> One remaining Chinese immigrant was found dead in a laundry house in Whitemen's Town, his home demolished by rioters.<ref name=larson/><ref name=tothis/> In total, 28 Chinese miners were confirmed dead, and at least 15 were wounded.<ref name=uw/><ref name=daniels/> There is speculation about the exact number of Chinese killed in Rock Springs. Various sources assert that 40&ndash;50 might be a more accurate number, as some of those who fled were never accounted for.<ref name=chollak>Chollak, Mark "[http://uwacadweb.uwyo.edu/RobertsHistory/rock_springs_massacre_chollak.htm The Rock Springs Massacre <U+2013> Sept. 2 1885]," (Lecture outline), History 1251: History of Wyoming, ''University of Wyoming'', spring 2006, Retrieved [[6 May]] [[2007]].</ref><ref name=lyman>Lyman, Stanford Morris.

==Outcome==
===Immediate aftermath===
[[Image:Troops on S Front St Rock Springs WY 1885.jpg|thumb|right|[[United States Army|Federal soldiers]] on South Front Street in [[Rock Springs, Wyoming|Rock Springs]], 1885.]]
In the days following the riot, the Chinese immigrants in Rock Springs fled 100&nbsp;miles west to [[Evanston, Wyoming]].<ref name=saxton/> The surviving Chinese were picked up by Union Pacific trains, and by [[September 5]], almost all of them were in Evanston.<ref name=saxton/> Once there, they were subjected to threats of murder and other crimes; Evanston was another area in Wyoming where anti&ndash;Chinese sentiment was high.<ref name=tothis/><ref name=saxton>Saxton, ''The Indispensable Enemy.''</ref> Rumors of the return of the Chinese to Rock Springs circulated since immediately after the riots. On [[September 3]], The ''Rock Springs Independent'' published an editorial which confirmed the rumors of "the return", as a few Chinese began to trickle back into town to search for valuables.<ref name=return/> ''The Independent'' said of the return of Chinese laborers to Rock Springs, "It means that Rock Springs is killed, as far as white men are concerned, if such program is carried out."<ref name=return>''Rock Springs Independent'', "The return!"</ref> The massacre was defended in the local newspaper, and, to an extent, in other western newspapers.<ref name=saxton/> In general, however, Wyoming newspapers disapproved of the acts of the massacre while supporting the cause of white miners.<ref name=larson/>
[[Image:FEWarren.jpg|thumb|left|Wyoming territorial Governor [[Francis E. Warren]] appealed to U.S. president Grover Cleveland for federal troops in Rock Springs.]]
Wyoming territorial Governor [[Francis E. Warren]] visited Rock Springs on [[September 3]], [[1885]], the day after the riot, to make a personal assessment. After his trip to Rock Springs, Warren traveled to Evanston, where he sent telegrams to U.S. President [[Grover Cleveland]] appealing for federal troops.<ref name=larson/> Back in Rock Springs, the riot had calmed, but the situation was still unstable.<ref name=nrhp/> Two companies of the [[United States Army]]'s 7th Infantry arrived on [[September 5]], [[1885]]. One company, under the command of a Lieutenant Colonel Anderson, was stationed in Evanston, Wyoming; the other, under a Colonel Chipman, was stationed in Rock Springs. At Camp Murray, [[Utah Territory]], a Colonel McCook was ordered to augment the garrison sent to Wyoming with six more companies.<ref name=nrhp/> On [[September 9]], [[1885]], one week after the massacre, six companies of soldiers arrived in [[Wyoming Territory|Wyoming]]. Four of the six companies then escorted the Chinese back to Rock Springs.<ref name=nrhp>Camp Pilot Butte, National Register of Historic Places.</ref> Once back in Rock Springs, the Chinese laborers found scorched tracts of land standing where their homes once had. The mining company had buried only a few dead; others remained lying in the open, mangled, decomposing, and partially eaten by dogs, hogs, or other animals.<ref name=return/>

The situation in Rock Springs was stabilized as early as [[September 15]], when Warren first requested the removal of federal troops, but the mines at Rock Springs remained closed for a time.<ref name=nrhp/> When the [[Union Pacific Coal Department]] reopened the mines, they fired 45 white miners. On [[September 30]], 500 white miners went on [[labor strike|strike]]. The strike was largely unsuccessful, and after two months, the strikers went back to work. Rock Springs steadily became quieter, and on [[October 5]], [[1885]] emergency troops, except for two companies, were removed. However, the temporary posts of Camp Medicine Butte, established in Evanston, and of Camp Pilot Butte, in Rock Springs, remained long after the riot. Camp Pilot Butte closed in 1899 after the onset of the [[Spanish&ndash;American War]].<ref name=nrhp/>

On [[September 30]], [[1885]] white miners, mostly [[Finnish people|Finnish]] immigrants who were members of the Knights of Labor, walked out of mines in [[Carbon County, Wyoming]], in protest of the company's continued use of Chinese miners. In Rock Springs, the white miners were still not back at work in late September, because the company still used Chinese labor.<ref name=nytstrike/> The strike was unsuccessful, and the miners went back to work within a couple of months.<ref name=larson/> The national Knights of Labor organization refused to support the Carbon strike and the hold out by white miners in Rock Springs following the Rock Springs Riot. The organization avoided supporting the miners along the [[Union Pacific Railroad]], because it did not want to be seen as condoning the violence at Rock Springs.<ref name=nytstrike>''The New York Times,'' "The Rock Springs Massacre", pg 3.</ref>

===Arrests===
After the riot in Rock Springs, sixteen men were arrested, including Isaiah Washington, a member&ndash;elect to the territorial legislature.<ref name=larson/> The men were taken to jail in Green River, where they were held until after a Sweetwater County [[grand jury]] refused to bring [[indictment]]s.<ref name=larson/> In explaining its decision, the grand jury declared that there was no cause for legal action, stating, in part, that, "We have diligently inquired into the occurrence at Rock Springs&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Though we have examined a large number of witnesses, no one has been able to testify to a single criminal act committed by any known white person that day."<ref name=daniels/>

No person or persons were ever convicted in the violence at Rock Springs. Those arrested as suspects in the riots were released a little more than a month later, on [[October 7]], [[1885]]. On their release, they were "&hellip;met&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. by several hundred men, women and children, and treated to a regular ovation," according to the reporting of ''[[The New York Times]]''.<ref name=nyt9>''The New York Times, '' "Anti Chinese Sentiment".</ref> The defendants in the Rock Springs case enjoyed the same broad community consent that [[lynch mob]]s often receive.<ref name=daniels/> For its own part, the coal mining company discharged 45 white miners for their participation in the riot.<ref name=daniels/>

===Diplomatic and political issues===
[[Image:Thomas F. Bayard, Brady-Handy photo portrait, circa 1870-1880.jpg|thumb|left|U.S. Secretary of State [[Thomas F. Bayard]] urged the U.S. Congress to indemnify the Chinese victims.]]
The riot in Rock Springs had consequences beyond the confines of the mining industry, Wyoming, or even the broader American West. After the riot, the [[U.S. government]] hesitated to make amends to the Chinese for the massacre.<ref name=whaley>Waley&ndash;Cohen, ''The Sextants of Beijing'', pp. 176&ndash;177.</ref> In [[China]], the [[governor-general|governor&ndash;general]] of the [[Guangdong]] region suggested that Americans in China might be the target of revenge for the action in Rock Springs.<ref name=whaley/> Indeed, the American envoy to China, [[Charles Harvey Denby]], and others in the diplomatic corps reported rising anti&ndash;American sentiment in [[Hong Kong]] and in [[Canton (city)|Canton]], [[Guangdong]], following the riot.<ref name=pletcher/> The American diplomats warned their government that the backlash from the massacre could ruin U.S. trade with China; they also reported that [[British Empire|British]] merchants and newspapers in China were encouraging the Chinese to "stand up for their oppressed countrymen in America."<ref name=pletcher/> Denby advised that [[U.S. Secretary of State]] [[Thomas F. Bayard|Thomas Bayard]] obtain compensation for the victims of the massacre.<ref name=pletcher>Pletcher, ''The Diplomacy of Involvement'', pp. 148&ndash;149.</ref>

The [[United States government]] agreed to pay compensation for the damaged property but not for the actual victims of the massacre,<ref name=whaley/> although Bayard was inclined to resist the requests for payments. In a letter to the minister of China's Washington legation dated [[February 18]], [[1886]], he expressed a personal view that the violence against Chinese immigrants was precipitated by their resistance to [[cultural assimilation]], and that racism against Chinese was typically found among other minorities rather than the majority of the populace:
<blockquote>Chinese immigrants... segregate themselves from the rest of the residents and citizens of the United States and... refuse to mingle with the mass of population... As a consequence, race prejudice has been more excited against them, notably among aliens of other nationalities...<ref name=letter>Bayard, Letter from Bayard to Cheng Tsao Ju</ref></blockquote>However, Denby's predictions caused him to seek a Congressional appropriation. At Bayard's urging, the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] provided $147,748.74 for indemnities.<ref name=pletcher/> The compensation was made as a monetary gift and not as a legal decree of responsibility for the massacre.<ref name=nrhp/><ref name=stgeorge>Tucker, "Limitations on the treaty&ndash;making power under the Constitution of the United States," pp. 271&ndash;273.</ref> The outcome amounted to a minor diplomatic victory for China.<ref name=whaley/> Governor Warren's reaction to the massacre was probably, in part, due to personal business holdings, as well as a desire to protect Chinese miners and helped make his career as a politician.<ref name=chollak/> Letters prove that Warren was close to Union Pacific officials during his term in office and that he petitioned the company for years to clear the titles on land he owned.<ref name=chollak/> Warren condemned the riot as "the most brutal and damnable outrage that ever occurred in any country."<ref name=fontes>Fontes and Fontes, ''Wyoming'', p. 14.</ref><ref name=footnote1>The U.S. [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]] holds dozens of letters to the [[United States Department of the Interior|Department of the Interior]] concerning Warren as governor of Wyoming that were written following the massacre. Many letters supported him, including one from UP President [[Charles Francis Adams, Jr.]], but there were many letters from political enemies which depicted him as "so deeply involved in business that he could not properly attend to the duties of his position." In the end, letters from two Wyoming lawyers charged that Warren illegally used federal funds when he appointed business associates to political positions. They also charged that he used his position to further his business interests in Wyoming. Warren nearly resigned his office as early as March 1886 but rescinded his resignation before it reached Cleveland; regardless Cleveland suspended him as governor on [[November 5]], [[1886]] and appointed George W. Baxter to the position. See Jackson, "The Governorship of Wyoming, 1885-1889".</ref>

===Reaction===
[[Image:President Grover Cleveland.jpg|thumb|left|U.S. President [[Grover Cleveland]] wrote about the riot in his 1885 [[State of the Union Address]].]]
After the riot, rhetoric and reaction came from publications and key political figures concerning the events. ''The New York Times'' blasted the city of Rock Springs in the first of at least two editorials on the topic, stating, "the appropriate fate for a community of this kind would be that of [[Sodom and Gomorrah]]."<ref name=sodom>''The New York Times,'' "Mob law in Wyoming".</ref> In another ''Times'' [[editorial]] on [[November 10]], [[1885]], the paper continued to assail not only the residents of Rock Springs who were involved in the violence, but those who stood by and let the mob continue its behavior.<ref name=nyt10>''The New York Times, '' "Protection of the Chinese".</ref> Newspapers in Wyoming, such as the ''Cheyenne Tribune'' and the Laramie ''Boomerang'', reacted with sympathy toward the white miners. The ''Boomerang'' stated it "regretted" the riot but found extenuating circumstances surrounding the violence.<ref name=daniels/>

In addition to newspapers, anti&ndash;Chinese sentiment and stereotypes came from other publications.<ref name=chaut/> Religious publications, such as ''Baptist Missionary Magazine'', depicted the Chinese as "heathens."<ref name=baptist>"Missionary News," ''Baptist Missionary Magazine'', May 1887, no. 67, pg 144.</ref> ''The Chautauquan: A Weekly Newsmagazine'' characterized the Chinese as weak and defenseless, stating in its coverage of the Massacre: "To murder an industrious [[Chinaman]] is the same kind of fiendish work as the murder of women and children &ndash; it is equally a violation of the rights of the defenceless (sic)."<ref name=chaut>"The Massacre in Wyoming." ''The Chautauquan: A Weekly Newsmagazine''. November 1885, pg 113.</ref>
[[Image:Powderly t kol.jpg|thumb|right|[[Terence Powderly]] reacted to the massacre in a letter to a magazine writer.]]
Powerful [[Knights of Labor]] leader [[Terence Powderly]] wrote in a letter to W.W. Stone (excerpts of which he included in a report to the U.S. Congress) that, "It is not necessary for me to speak of the numerous reasons given for the opposition to this particular race &ndash; their habits, religion, customs and practices . . ." Powderly blamed the "problem" of Chinese immigration on the failings of the 1882 Exclusion Act. He blamed lax law enforcement, not those involved in the riots, for the attacks at Rock Springs. Powderly wrote that the U.S. Congress should stop "winking at violations of this statute" and reform the laws which barred Chinese immigration, which he believed could have prevented incidents such as "the recent assault upon the Chinese at Rock Springs".<ref name=stone1>Stone, "The Knights of Labor on the Chinese Labor Situation", pg 1.</ref>

In December 1885, U.S. President [[Grover Cleveland]] presented his [[State of the Union]] report to Congress, and in it, his reaction to the Rock Springs Massacre. (Before 1934, the State of the Union was usually given before the New Year, and between 1801 and 1912 the message was presented as a lengthy, written report to the U.S. Congress).<ref name=pres>Peters, "State of the Union Messages"</ref> Cleveland's report pointed out that America was interested in good relations with [[China]]. He stated, "All of the power of this government should be exhorted to maintain the amplest good faith towards China in the treatment of these men, and the inflexible sternness of the law&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. must be insisted upon." Cleveland noted that "race prejudice is the chief factor to originating these disturbances."<ref name=nyt8>''The New York Times,'' "The Message to Congress".</ref>

==Post-massacre violence==

The massacre at Rock Springs led to other incidents of anti&ndash;Chinese aggression, primarily in Washington Territory, though there were incidents in Oregon and other states as well. Near [[Newcastle, Washington]] a mob of whites burned down the barracks of 36 Chinese coal miners.<ref name=uw/> Throughout the [[Puget Sound]] area, Chinese workers were driven out of communities and subject to violence in cities and towns such as [[Tacoma]], [[Seattle]], [[Newcastle, Washington|Newcastle]], and [[Issaquah, Washington|Issaquah]] (Squak). Chinese workers were driven out of other Washington towns, but sources indicated, as early as 1891, that the above were specifically connected to the wave of violence touched off at Rock Springs.<ref name=uw/><ref name=tacoma>Long, "Tacoma expels the entire Chinese community on November 3, 1885"</ref><ref name=tibbets>Long, "White and Indian hop pickers attack Chinese".</ref><ref name=grant>Grant, ''History of Seattle, Washington''</ref> 

The wave of anti&ndash;Chinese violence in the western United States following the Rock Springs Riot spread further, to the state of Oregon.<ref name=uw/> Mobs drove Chinese workers out of small towns throughout the state in late 1885 and mid&ndash;1886.<ref name=uw>History of Washington State & the Pacific Northwest, "Lesson Fifteen".</ref> Other states reported incidents as well: As far away as [[Augusta, Georgia]], anger was expressed against the Chinese in response to the massacre at Rock Springs. According to the reporting of ''The New York Times'', the rioting in Rock Springs fueled the desire of anti&ndash;Chinese Georgians in Augusta to air their grievances.<ref name=nyt6>''The New York Times,'' "The Chinese In Augusta".</ref>

==Significance and context==
The Rock Springs Massacre was seen by observers at the time, and by historians today, as the worst and most significant of the instances of anti&ndash;Chinese violence in the 19th century [[United States]].<ref name=whaley/><ref name=grant/> The riot received widespread media coverage from publications such as the ''[[Police Gazette|The National Police Gazette]]'' and ''[[The New York Times]]''.<ref name=gazette>"The Chinese Massacre," ''The National Police Gazette'', [[19 September]] [[1885]], No. 418, pg 2.</ref> Among the events of anti-Chinese violence in the American west, the Rock Springs Massacre is considered the most widely publicized.<ref name=saxton2/> The attacks at Rock Springs were extraordinarily violent, revealing a long-held, almost "[[feral]]," hatred of the victims.<ref name=courtwright/> The sheer brutality of the violence "startled" the entire country.<ref name=grant/> Besides those who were burned alive, Chinese miners were [[scalping|scalped]], [[mutilation|mutilated]], [[Human branding|branded]], [[decapitation|decapitated]], [[dismemberment|dismembered]], and [[hanging|hanged]] from gutter spouts.<ref name=courtwright/> One of the Chinese miners had his penis and testicles cut off and [[toast (honor)|toasted]] in a nearby saloon as a "trophy of the hunt."<ref name=courtwright/><ref>See also [[hunting trophy]].</ref> The events amounted to racial terrorism.<ref name=courtwright>Courtwright, ''Violent Land'', pp. 157&ndash;158.</ref>

Today, nearly all [[historian]]s hold the view that the prime factor which contributed to the riot was [[racism|race prejudice]].<ref name=chan/><ref name=daniels2>Daniels, ''Incident at Bitter Creek'', pp. 144&ndash;145.</ref> However, a 1990 work on the Rock Springs Massacre, written by journalist Craig Storti, marginalized the racial factor and put a stronger emphasis on the economic factors which contributed to violence.<ref name=armentrout/><ref name=daniels2/> His book, ''Incident at Bitter Creek: The Rock Springs Massacre'', was roundly panned by historical critics<ref name=armentrout>Armentrout Ma, ''Incident at Bitter Creek''.</ref><ref name=chan>Chan, ''Incident at Bitter Creek''.</ref><ref name=daniels2/><ref name=hardaway>Hardaway, ''Incident at Bitter Creek''.</ref>, though Storti stated he represented the historical record as it stood.<ref>Roger Daniels, a scholar of Chinese immigration in his own right, criticized Storti's work; Daniels asserted that Storti believed the cause of the massacre was the "failure of the Chinese to become integrated into [[American culture]]." (See Hane, ''Asian America''.) Storti responded to the review in a letter, stating, in part, "Mr. Daniels' numerous inaccurate statements rival those he claims to have found in my text." (See Storti and Daniels, Communication &ndash; Letter from Storti.)</ref> There were labor considerations that contributed to the violence in Rock Springs, though they are generally seen as less significant.<ref name=armentrout/><ref name=chan/><ref name=daniels2/> The use of Chinese workers by the railroad during an 1875 strike created widespread resentment among the white miners, which continued to build until the Rock Springs Massacre. Storti's book described anti&ndash;Chinese racism as "pervasive" even while downplaying its significance to the riot.<ref name=chan/> The failure of the Chinese to assimilate into American culture is largely a myth and long-perpetuated [[stereotype]].<ref name=chan/> Regardless, the view was held historically and still carries weight within the modern-day interpretation of the historical record.<ref name=grant/><ref name=chan/>

Modern-day Rock Springs is no longer the mining town it was in 1885. With a population pushing 20,000, the former settlement is today a full-fledged city. The area that once encompassed Camp Pilot Butte is located on the north bank of Bitter Creek, in the northwest part of the city. The camp covered 5<U+00BD> [[acre]]s of Union Pacific property; the parade ground was in the center of a present-day city block bounded by Soulsby Street on the west, Pilot Butte Avenue on the east, Bridger Avenue on the north and Elias Avenue on its south.<ref name=nrhp/> In 1973, the area where the army post once existed was listed on the U.S. [[National Register of Historic Places]] as an [[historic district]]. At that time, there were only two remaining original structures.<ref name=nrhp/> The two buildings were owned by the Saints Cyril and Methodius Catholic Church in Rock Springs.<ref>This church was named after the [[Saints Cyril and Methodius]] and is part of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Cheyenne]].</ref> The buildings are no longer extant, and the property is no longer listed on the National Register.<ref name=nris>[http://www.nr.nps.gov/ National Register Information System], National Register of Historic Places, ''National Park Service''. Retrieved [[7 May]] [[2007]].</ref> The area that was once [[Chinatown]], just to the north of where Camp Pilot Butte once stood, had a public elementary school built over part of it. In general, the locations in Rock Springs associated with the massacre have been surrounded and absorbed by the city's growth.<ref name=nrhp/>
