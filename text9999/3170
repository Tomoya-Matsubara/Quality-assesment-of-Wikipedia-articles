The [[chemical compound|chemical substance]] '''hydrochloric acid''' is the [[aqueous]] ([[Water (molecule)|water]]-based) [[solution]] of [[hydrogen chloride]] ([[Hydrogen|H]][[Chlorine|Cl]]) gas. It is a [[strong acid]], the major component of [[gastric acid]] and of wide industrial use. As a highly [[corrosive]] [[liquid]], hydrochloric acid should be handled only with appropriate [[safety]] precautions. 

Hydrochloric acid, or '''muriatic acid''' by its historical but still occasionally used name, has been an important and frequently-used chemical from early history, and was discovered by the [[alchemy|alchemist]] [[Geber|Jabir ibn Hayyan]] around the year 800. It was used throughout the [[Middle Ages]] by alchemists in the quest for the [[philosopher's stone]], and later by several European [[scientist]]s including [[Johann Rudolf Glauber|Glauber]], [[Joseph Priestley|Priestley]], and [[Humphry Davy|Davy]], to help establish modern chemical knowledge.

During the [[Industrial Revolution]], it became an important industrial chemical for many applications, including the large-scale production of [[organic chemistry|organic]] compounds, such as [[vinyl chloride]] for [[polyvinyl chloride|PVC]] [[plastic]] and [[Methylene diphenyl diisocyanate|MDI]]/[[Toluene diisocyanate|TDI]] for [[polyurethane]], and smaller-scale applications, such as production of [[gelatin]] and other [[cooking|ingredients in food]], and [[leather]] processing.  At present, production is approximately 20 million metric [[tonnes]] annually (20 Mt/a) of HCl gas.

==History==
Hydrochloric acid was first discovered around the year 800 by the [[Alchemy|alchemist]] [[Geber|Jabir ibn Hayyan (Geber)]], by mixing [[Sodium chloride|common salt]] with [[vitriol]] ([[sulfuric acid]]). Jabir discovered or invented many important chemicals, and wrote his findings in over twenty books, which carried his chemical knowledge of hydrochloric acid and other basic chemicals for hundreds of years. Jabir's invention of the gold-dissolving [[aqua regia]], consisting of hydrochloric acid and [[nitric acid]], contributed to the effort of alchemists trying to find the [[philosopher's stone]].

[[Image:Jabir ibn Hayyan.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Jabir ibn Hayyan, medieval manuscript drawing]]
In&nbsp;the [[Middle Ages]], hydrochloric acid was known to European alchemists as ''spirit of salt'' or ''acidum salis''. Gaseous HCl was called ''marine acid air''. The old (pre-[[systematic name|systematic]]) name ''muriatic acid'' has the same origin (''muriatic'' means "pertaining to brine or salt"), and this name is still sometimes used. Notable production was recorded by [[Basilius Valentinus]], the alchemist-[[Canon (priest)|canon]] of the [[Benedictine]] [[priory]] Sankt Peter in [[Erfurt|Erfurt, Germany]] in the fifteenth century. 

In the seventeenth century, [[Johann Rudolf Glauber]] from [[Karlstadt am Main|Karlstadt am Main, Germany]] used salt ([[sodium chloride]]) and [[sulfuric acid]] for the preparation of [[sodium sulfate]], releasing [[hydrogen chloride]] gas. [[Joseph Priestley]] from [[Leeds, England]] prepared pure [[hydrogen chloride]] in [[1772]], and in [[1818]] [[Humphry Davy]] from [[Penzance, England]] proved that the chemical composition included [[hydrogen]] and [[chlorine]]. 

During the [[Industrial Revolution]] in Europe, demand for [[alkaline]] substances, such as [[soda ash]] increased, and the new industrial soda-process by [[Nicolas Leblanc]] ([[Issoudun|Issoundun, France]]) enabled cheap large-scale production. In the [[Leblanc process]], salt is converted to soda ash, using sulfuric acid, limestone, and coal, releasing hydrogen chloride as a by-product. Until the [[Alkali Act]] of 1863, excess HCl was vented to the air. After the passage of the act, soda ash producers were obliged to absorb the waste gas in water, producing hydrochloric acid on an industrial scale.

When early in the twentieth century the Leblanc process was effectively replaced by the [[Solvay process]] without hydrochloric acid by-product, hydrochloric acid was already fully settled as an important chemical in numerous applications. The commercial interest initiated other production methods which are still used today, as described below. Today, most hydrochloric acid is made by absorbing hydrogen chloride from [[Hydrochloric acid#Production|industrial organic compounds production]].

Hydrochloric acid is listed as a Table II precursor under the 1988 [[Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances]] because of its use in the production of [[heroin]] and [[cocaine]] [http://www.incb.org/pdf/e/list/red.pdf].

==Chemistry==
[[Image:Titration.gif|frame|left|70px|Acid titration]]
Hydrogen chloride (HCl) is a [[monoprotic acid]], which can [[Dissociation_(chemistry)|dissociate]] (''i.e.,'' ionize) only once to give up one H<sup>+</sup> ion (a single [[proton]]). In aqueous hydrochloric acid, the H<sup>+</sup> joins a water molecule to form a [[hydronium]] ion, H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>:

:: HCl + H<sub>2</sub>O &rarr; H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> + Cl<sup><U+2212></sup>

The other ion formed is Cl<sup><U+2212></sup> or [[Chloride|chloride ion]]. Hydrochloric acid can therefore be used to prepare salts called ''chlorides'', such as [[sodium chloride]].  Hydrochloric acid is considered a strong acid, since it is practically fully dissociated in water.

[[Image:HCl molecule model-VdW surface.png|115px|thumb|Molecular model of hydrogen chloride.]]
Monoprotic acids have one [[acid dissociation constant]], K<sub>a</sub>, which indicates the level of dissociation in water.  For a strong acid like HCl, K<sub>a</sub> is large. Theoretical attempts to assign a K<sub>a</sub> to HCl have been made; see [http://www.chembuddy.com/?left=BATE&right=dissociation_constants]. When chloride salts such as NaCl are added to aqueous HCl they have practically no effect on pH, indicating that Cl<sup><U+2212></sup> is an exceedingly weak [[conjugate base]] and that HCl is fully dissociated in aqueous solution. For intermediate to strong solutions of hydrochloric acid, the assumption that H<sup>+</sup> [[molarity]] (a unit of [[concentration]]) equals HCl molarity is excellent, agreeing to four significant digits. 
			
Of the seven common [[strong acid]]s in chemistry, all of them [[inorganic]], hydrochloric acid is the monoprotic acid least likely to undergo an interfering [[redox|oxidation-reduction]] reaction. It is one of the least-hazardous strong acids to handle; despite its acidity, it produces the less-reactive and non-toxic chloride ion. Intermediate-strength hydrochloric acid solutions are quite stable, maintaining their concentrations over time. These attributes, plus the fact that it is available as a pure [[reagent]], means that hydrochloric acid makes an excellent acidifying reagent and acid titrant (for determining the amount of an unknown quantity of [[base (chemistry)|base]] in [[titration]]). Strong acid titrants are useful because they give more distinct endpoints in a [[titration]], making the titration more precise. Hydrochloric acid is frequently used in [[chemical analysis]] and to digest samples for analysis. Concentrated hydrochloric acid will dissolve some [[metal]]s to form oxidized metal chlorides and [[hydrogen]] gas. It will produce metal chlorides from [[base_(chemistry)|basic]] compounds such as [[calcium carbonate]] or [[copper(II) oxide]]. It is also used as a simple acid [[catalyst]] for some [[chemical reaction]]s.

;Physical properties
The [[physical property|physical properties]] of hydrochloric acid, such as [[boiling point|boiling]] and [[melting points]], [[density]], and [[pH]] depend on the [[concentration]] or [[molarity]] of HCl in the acid solution. They can range from those of water at 0% HCl to values for fuming hydrochloric acid at over 40% HCl.

Hydrochloric acid as the binary (two-component) mixture of HCl and H<sub>2</sub>O has a constant-[[boiling point|boiling]] [[azeotrope]] at 20.2% HCl and 108.6 <U+00B0>C (227 <U+00B0>F). There are four constant-[[crystallization]] [[eutectic|eutectic points]] for hydrochloric acid, between the [[crystal]] form of HCl&middot;H<sub>2</sub>O (68% HCl), HCl&middot;2H<sub>2</sub>O (51% HCl), HCl&middot;3H<sub>2</sub>O (41% HCl), HCl&middot;6H<sub>2</sub>O (25% HCl), and of course [[ice]] (0% HCl). There is also a metastable [[eutectic]] at 24.8% between ice and the HCl&middot;3H<sub>2</sub>O crystallization.

== Production ==
[[image:hclplant-udl.jpg|frame|Hydrochloric acid oven]]
=== Direct synthesis ===
The large scale [[production]] of hydrochloric acid is almost always integrated with other industrial scale chemical production. In the [[chloralkali process|chlor-alkali]] industry, [[sodium chloride|salt]] solution is [[electrolysis|electrolyzed]] producing [[chlorine]], [[sodium hydroxide]], and [[hydrogen]]. The pure [[chlorine]] gas can be re-combined with the [[hydrogen]] gas, forming chemically pure HCl gas. As the reaction is [[exothermic reaction|exothermic]], the installation is called an HCl [[oven]]. 

:: Cl<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub> &rarr; 2HCl

The resulting pure [[hydrogen chloride]] gas is [[absorption|absorbed]] in [[ion exchange resin#Water softening|demineralized]] water, resulting in chemically pure hydrochloric acid.

===Organic synthesis===
The largest [[production]] of hydrochloric acid is integrated with the formation of [[chlorination|chlorinated]] and [[fluorine|fluorinated]] [[organic chemistry|organic]] compounds, e.g., [[Teflon]], [[Freon]] and other [[CFC]]s, chloro-acetic acid, and [[polyvinyl chloride|PVC]]. Often this production of hydrochloric acid is integrated with captive use of it on-site. In the [[chemical reaction]]s, hydrogen [[atom]]s are replaced by chlorine atoms, whereupon the released hydrogen atom re-combines with the spare atom from the chlorine molecule, forming hydrogen chloride. Fluorination is a subsequent chlorine-replacement reaction, producing again hydrogen chloride.

:: R-H + Cl<sub>2</sub> &rarr; R-Cl + HCl
:: R-Cl + HF &rarr; R-F + HCl

The resulting hydrogen chloride gas is either re-used directly, or absorbed in water, resulting in hydrochloric acid of technical or industrial grade.

===Industrial market===
Hydrochloric acid is produced in solutions up to 38% HCl (concentrated grade). Higher [[concentration]]s up to just over 40% are chemically possible, but the [[evaporation]] rate is then so high that [[storage]] and handling need extra precautions, such as [[pressure]] and low [[temperature]]. Bulk industrial-grade is therefore 30% to 34%, optimized for effective [[transport]] and limited product loss by HCl [[vapour]]s. Solutions for household purposes, mostly cleaning, are typically 10% to 12%, with strong recommendations to dilute before use.

Major producers worldwide include [[Dow Chemical Company|Dow Chemical]] at 2 million metric tonnes annually (2&nbsp;Mt/year), calculated as HCl gas, and [[Formosa Plastics|FMC]], [[Georgia Gulf|Georgia Gulf Corporation]], [[Tosoh|Tosoh Corporation]], [[Akzo Nobel]], and [[Tessenderlo]] at 0.5 to 1.5 Mt/year each. Total world production, for comparison purposes expressed as HCl, is estimated at 20 Mt/year, with 3 Mt/year from direct synthesis, and the rest as secondary product from organic and similar syntheses. By far, most of all hydrochloric acid is consumed captively by the producer. The open world market size is estimated at 5 Mt/year.

==Applications==
Hydrochloric acid is a strong inorganic acid that is used in many industrial processes. The application often determines the required product quality.

===Regeneration of ion exchangers===
An important application of high-quality hydrochloric acid is the regeneration of [[ion exchange resin]]s. [[Ion exchange|Cation exchange]] is widely used to remove [[ion]]s such as Na<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> from [[aqueous]] solutions, producing [[ion exchange resin#Water softening|demineralized]] water.

:: Na<sup>+</sup> is replaced by H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>
:: Ca<sup>2+</sup> is replaced by 2H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>

Ion exchangers and demineralized water are used in all chemical industries, [[drinking water]] production, and many [[food]] industries.

===pH Control and neutralization===
A very common application of hydrochloric acid is to regulate the [[basicity]] ([[pH]]) of solutions. 

:: OH<sup><U+2212></sup> + HCl <U+2192> H<sub>2</sub>O + Cl<sup><U+2212></sup>

In industry demanding purity (food, pharmaceutical, drinking water), high-quality hydrochloric acid is used to control the pH of process water streams. In less-demanding industry, technical-quality hydrochloric acid suffices for [[acid-base reaction theories|neutralizing]] waste streams and [[swimming pool]] treatment.

===Pickling of steel===
[[Pickling (metal)|Pickling]] is an essential step in [[metal]] surface treatment, to remove [[rust]] or [[iron oxide]] scale from [[iron]] or [[steel]] before subsequent processing, such as [[extrusion]], [[rolling]], [[galvanization|galvanizing]], and other techniques. Technical-quality HCl at typically 18% concentration is the most commonly-used pickling agent for the pickling of carbon steel grades.

:: Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> + Fe + 6HCl &rarr; 3FeCl<sub>2</sub> + 3H<sub>2</sub>O

The [[spent acid]] has long been re-used as [[ferrous chloride]] solutions, but high [[heavy metals|heavy-metal]] levels in the pickling liquor has decreased this practice.

In recent years, the steel pickling industry has however developed hydrochloric acid regeneration processes, such as the spray roaster or the fluidised bed HCl regeneration process, which allow the recovery of HCl from spent pickling liquor. These are two Pyrohydrolysis [http://www.acreg.com ACREG] Processes. The most common regeneration process is the [http://www.acreg.com ACREG] [http://www.dependeq.com Dependeq] [http://www.astec-engineering.com ASTEC] - Process, applying the following formula:

:: 4FeCl<sub>2</sub> + 4H<sub>2</sub>O + O<sub>2</sub> &rarr; 8HCl+ 2Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>

By this means, a closed acid loop is established. The ferric oxide by product of the regeneration process is a valuable by-product, used in a variety of secondary industries.

HCl is not a common pickling agent for stainless steel grades.

===Production of inorganic compounds===
Numerous products can be produced with hydrochloric acid in normal [[Acid-base reaction theories|acid-base reactions]], resulting in [[inorganic]] compounds. These include water treatment chemicals such as [[iron(III) chloride]] and [[Aluminium chlorohydrate|polyaluminium chloride (PAC)]].

:: Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> + 6 HCl &rarr; 2 FeCl<sub>3</sub> + 3 H<sub>2</sub>O

Both [[iron(III) chloride]] and PAC are used as [[flocculation]] and coagulation agents in [[wastewater#treatment|wastewater treatment]], [[drinking water]] production, and [[paper]] production.

Other inorganic compounds produced with hydrochloric acid include road application salt [[calcium chloride]], [[nickel(II) chloride]] for [[electroplating]], and [[zinc chloride]] for the [[galvanizing]] industry and [[battery (electricity)|battery]] production.

===Production of organic compounds===
The largest hydrochloric acid consumption is in the production of [[organic compounds]] such as [[vinyl chloride]] for [[polyvinyl chloride|PVC]], and [[Methylene diphenyl diisocyanate|MDI]] and [[Toluene diisocyanate|TDI]] for [[polyurethane]]. This is often captive use, consuming locally-produced hydrochloric acid that never actually reaches the open market. Other [[organic chemistry|organic]] compounds produced with hydrochloric acid include [[bisphenol A]] for [[polycarbonate]], [[activated carbon]], and [[ascorbic acid]], as well as numerous [[pharmaceutical]] products.

===Other applications===
Hydrochloric acid is a fundamental chemical, and as such it is used for a large number of small-scale applications, such as [[leather]] processing, household [[cleaning]], and [[building]] [[construction]]. In addition, a way of stimulating [[petroleum#Extraction|oil production]] is by injecting hydrochloric acid into the rock formation of an [[oil well]], dissolving a portion of the rock, and creating a large-pore structure. Oil-well acidizing is a common process in the [[North Sea oil]] production industry.

Many chemical reactions involving hydrochloric acid are applied in the production of [[food]], food [[ingredients]], and [[food additive]]s. Typical products include [[aspartame]], [[fructose]], [[citric acid]], [[lysine]], hydrolyzed  (vegetable) [[protein]] as food enhancer, and in [[gelatin]] production. Food-grade (extra-pure) hydrochloric acid can be applied when needed for the final product.

==Hydrochloric acid and living organisms==
===Physiology and pathology===
Hydrochloric acid constitutes the majority of [[gastric acid]], the human [[digestive fluid]]. In a complex process and at a large energetic burden, it is secreted by [[parietal cell]]s (also known as oxyntic cells). These cells contain an extensive secretory network (called canaliculi) from which the HCl is secreted into the [[lumen]] of the stomach. They are part of the [[epithelium|epithelial]] [[fundic gland]]s (also known as oxyntic glands) in the [[stomach]].

Safety mechanisms that prevent the damage of the [[epithelium]] of digestive tract by hydrochloric acid are the following:

* Negative regulators of its release
* A thick [[mucus]] layer covering the epithelium
* [[Sodium bicarbonate]] secreted by gastric epithelial cells and pancreas
* The structure of epithelium ([[tight junction]]s)
* Adequate blood supply
* [[Prostaglandin]]s (many different effects: they stimulate mucus and bicarbonate secretion, maintain epithelial barrier integrity, enable adequate blood supply, stimulate the healing of the damaged mucous membrane)

When, due to different reasons, these mechanisms fail, [[heartburn]] or [[peptic ulcer]]s can develop. Drugs called [[proton pump inhibitor]]s prevent the body from making excess acid in the stomach, while [[antacid]]s neutralize existing acid. 

In some instances, not enough of hydrochloric acid gets produced in the stomach. These pathologic states are denoted by the terms [[hypochlorhydria]] and [[achlorhydria]]. Potentially they can lead to [[gastroenteritis]].

===Chemical weapons===
[[Phosgene]] (COCl<sub>2</sub>) was a common [[chemical warfare]] agent used in [[World War I]]. The main effect of [[phosgene]] results from the dissolution of the gas in the mucous membranes deep in the [[lung]], where it is converted by [[hydrolysis]] into [[carbonic acid]] and the corrosive hydrochloric acid. The latter disrupts the [[pulmonary alveolus|alveolar]]-[[capillary]] [[biological membrane|membrane]]s so that the lung becomes filled with fluid ([[pulmonary edema]]). 

Hydrochloric acid is also partly responsible for the harmful or blistering effects of [[mustard gas]].  In the presence of [[water]], such as on the moist surface of the eyes or lungs, mustard gas breaks down forming hydrochloric acid.

|}

Hydrochloric acid in high concentrations forms acidic mists. Both the mist and the solution have a corrosive effect on human tissue, potentially damaging respiratory organs, eyes, skin and intestines. Upon mixing hydrochloric acid with common oxidizing chemicals, such as [[sodium hypochlorite|bleach (NaClO)]] or [[potassium permanganate|permanganate (KMnO<sub>4</sub>)]], the toxic gas [[chlorine]] is produced. To minimize the risks while working with hydrochloric acid, appropriate precautions should be taken. For example, water should never be added to the concentrated acid, as the water could boil; rather, acid should be added to water. See references for details.

The hazards of solutions of hydrochloric acid depend on the concentration. The following table lists the [[Directive 67/548/EEC|EU classification]] of hydrochloric acid solutions:
