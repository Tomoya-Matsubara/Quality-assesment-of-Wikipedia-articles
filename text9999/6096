The '''Barr Hotel''' is a historic [[hotel]] on the eastern side of downtown [[Lima, Ohio|Lima]], [[Ohio]], [[United States]].  Built in 1914, the [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] hotel occupies the northeastern corner of the intersection of High and Union Streets.<ref name=nris />

==Architecture==
The primary portion of the hotel is a brick building, seven [[storey|stories]] tall;<ref name=dohp>Owen, Lorrie K., ed.  ''Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places''.  Vol. 1.  [[St. Clair Shores, Michigan|St. Clair Shores]]: Somerset, 1999, 9.</ref> it rests on a concrete [[foundation (engineering)|foundation]]<ref name=ohs>[http://ohsweb.ohiohistory.org/ohpo/nr/details.aspx?refnum=86001053 Barr Hotel], [[Ohio Historical Society]], 2007.  Accessed 2010-05-13.</ref> and is covered by a flat roof.<ref name=dohp /> Next to this portion is a connected building, four stories high and also built of brick.<ref name=ohs /> Large [[sash window]]s and [[Ionic order|Ionic]]-capped [[pilaster]]s are among the most distinctive elements of the primary portion of the hotel.<ref name=dohp />

==Historical context==
During the early twentieth century, Lima experienced rapid growth as a result of its place as a hub for [[Standard Oil]] and as the home of the [[Lima Locomotive Works]].  Many large buildings were erected in the city's downtown, including the still-standing [[Hotel Argonne]] and the [[Ohio Theatre (Lima, Ohio)|Ohio Theatre]].<ref name=mps>Hopkins, Phyllis G.

Accessed 2010-04-24.</ref>{{rp|5}}  The Barr Hotel is a typical building of this period.<ref name=dohp />

==Recognition==
In 1986, the Barr Hotel was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] because of its significance in overall American history.  As a little-altered example of Lima's golden years,<ref name=dohp /> the hotel was significant partially because of the unusually frequent destruction of historic buildings in Lima since the early twentieth century.<ref name=mps />{{rp|3}}
