'''Belfast Botanic Gardens''' is a public park in [[Belfast]], [[Northern Ireland]]. 

Occupying 28 acres of south Belfast, the gardens are popular with office workers, students and tourists. They are located on Stranmillis Road in Belfast's university area, with [[Queen's University of Belfast|Queen's University]] nearby. The [[Ulster Museum]] is located at the main entrance. 

==History==
The gardens opened in 1828 as the private Royal Belfast Botanical Gardens. It continued as a private park for many years, only opening to members of the public on Sundays prior to 1895. Then it became a public park in 1895 when the Belfast Corporation bought the gardens from the Belfast Botanical and Horticultural Society. The Belfast Corporation was the predecessor of [[Belfast City Council]], the present owner.

==The Palm House==
The gardens' most notable feature is the Palm House. The foundation stone was laid by the [[George Chichester, 3rd Marquess of Donegall|Marquess of Donegall]] in 1839 and work was completed in 1840. It is one of the earliest examples of a curvilinear [[cast iron]] [[glasshouse]] in the world. Designed by [[Charles Lanyon]] and built by [[Richard Turner (iron-founder)|Richard Turner]], Belfast's Palm House predates the glasshouses at [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew|Kew]] and the [[Irish National Botanic Gardens]] at [[Glasnevin]]. Turner went on to build both of these glasshouses. The Palm House consists of two wings, the cool wing and the tropical wing which contains the dome. Lanyon altered his original plans to increase the height of the dome, allowing for much taller plants. In the past these have included an 11 metre tall ''Globe Spear Lily''. The [[Lilium|lily]], which is native to [[Australia]], finally bloomed in March 2005 after a 23 year wait. The Palm House also features a 400 year old ''[[Xanthorrhoea]]''.

==Other features==
The gardens also contain another glasshouse, the Tropical Ravine House. Built by head gardener Charles McKimm in 1889, it features a unique design. A sunken ravine runs the length of the building, with a balcony at each side for viewing. The most popular attraction is the ''[[Sterculiaceae|Dombeya]]'', which flowers every February.

The Palm House and the Tropical Ravine House were symbols of Belfast's growing industrial might and prosperity in the [[Victorian era]] and attracted over 10,000 visitors a day.
The gardens also feature one of the longest [[herb]]aceous borders in [[British Isles|Britain or Ireland]]. The is also a rose garden built in 1932 and various species of tree, including the hornbeam-[[oak]]. A statue of [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Lord Kelvin]] stands at the Stranmillis Road entrance. 

==Concerts==
Concerts and [[music festival]]s are held at the Stranmillis Embankment end of the gardens. From 2002 to 2006 the [[Tennents ViTal]] festival was held in the gardens. Performers included [[Kings of Leon]], [[Franz Ferdinand (band)|Franz Ferdinand]], [[The Coral]], [[The Streets]] and [[The White Stripes]]. In 2006 [[Snow Patrol]], [[The Raconteurs]], [[Editors]] and [[Kaiser Chiefs]] played at the festival.

On [[August 26]], [[1997]] [[U2]] played their first Belfast concert in over a decade as part of the [[PopMart Tour]]. 40,000 fans attended, with thousands more lining the perimeter fence and watching from rooftops on Ridgeway Street. Local band [[Ash (band)|Ash]] and [[Howard Bernstein|Howard B]] were the support acts.

==Popular culture==
While the consumption of alcohol is banned within the park, groups of young people drinking are common during the summer months. The opening scene of [[Colin Bateman|Colin Bateman's]] novel ''[[Divorcing Jack (novel)|Divorcing Jack]]'' finds the protagonist Dan Starkey with a crate of [[Harp Lager|Harp]] in the gardens.
