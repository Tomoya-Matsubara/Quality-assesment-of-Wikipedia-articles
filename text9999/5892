'''Waterford city''' is situated in south eastern [[Ireland]], on the [[river Suir]] [pronounced Shure] about seventeen miles from where the river enters the sea. Practically the entire city is built on the south bank of the river. The "Old town", now the business centre, clusters behind the broad quay-front on a low-lying strip of land left behind by a gentle loop of the river at this point. From this, the land rises sharply to the east and opposite to the west while remaining level in between. The eastern slopes are almost entirely occupied by private residential estates, while the western and southwestern prominences are largely given over to local authority housing development. There are corresponding elevations on the north bank eastwards towards Christendom and westwards towards Mount Misery. 

Structure:  Latitude:  52<U+00BA>  16' North, Longitude  7<U+00BA>   7' West
The rocks which form the base of the City all belong to the Palaeozoic Group: principally Ordovician Shales, underlying some Sandstone on the North West, and crossed - East of the centre of the City - by an Alluvial bank running N.E./S.W. At the cliffs on the North and South banks of the River Suir, above Rice Bridge, inter-stratification of sharply-folded Ordovician Slates and Sandstone conglomerates may be clearly observed.

Waterford is Ireland's oldest city and was founded by the [[Vikings]] in the [[9th century]]. It was taken over by the Anglo-Norman invaders of the 12th century and was one of the most important [[Old English (Ireland)|Old English]] entres in medieval Ireland. Since then it has seen sieges, invasions, famine and economic highs and lows. It remains the foremost city in Ireland's south-east. 

See [[Rulers of Waterford]] for a list of the city's rulers from 914 to the present day.

==Foundation== 
The foundation of [[Waterford]] is claimed in some quarters to have taken place late in prehistoric times. Other writers place the event about the middle of the second century. However, it is difficult to go along any distance with either theory on the strength of the supporting evidence quoted. At any rate the antiquity of the place where Waterford now stands cannot be traced with any satisfactory degree of certainty beyond about [[850]] A.D. when the site was occupied and fortified by [[Sigtrygg (disambiguation)|Sigtrygg]] [[Sitric (disambiguation)|(Sitric)]] the Dane. The inhabitants of this part of Ireland in pre-Danish times were a pastoral people moving from place to place with their flocks or else given to hunting. They did not build towns, unless we admit as towns the settlements that sometimes sprang up in the neighbourhood of Monasteries. They certainly did not build sea-ports, and it was as a sea-port that Waterford had its beginning.   

The [[Vikings|Ostmen]] or Danes as they are more commonly called, persuaded by the rigours of their own inhospitable clime, had taken to the high seas in search of plunder. During the first half of the ninth century the shores of south-east Ireland were ravaged time after time by Danish expeditions, [[Ardmore, County Waterford|Ardmore]] and [[Lismore, County Waterford|Lismore]] being the subjects of a number of raids. At the outset, these bellicose incursions took place only during the summer months, the raiders returning home with their spoils at the onset of winter. About [[853]] A.D., however, [[Sigtrygg (disambiguation)|Sigtrygg]], the Danish chieftain, settled at Waterford and set up a fortified encampment. A number of factors influenced the choice of the site. The place provided a splendid anchorage. It was the lowest point at which the river could at that time be forded. Above all, the site could easily be defended. It was protected on three sides by water; in front by the Suir; on the east and at rear by [[John's River|St. John's River]] and the marshes flanking it. St. John's River did not then, as now, flow neatly between regular banks. Rather, its tortuous and uncontained stream meandered over much of the ground now occupied by Lombard Street, William Street, the [[People's Park (Waterford)|People's Park]], Catherine Street, and Parnell Street, turning this entire area into viscous marshland. These marshes also extended westwards round the back of the site of the old town. Only on the west itself were substantial fortifications necessary. This was Waterford in its infancy, a Danish stronghold, subject to constant harassment by the Irish outside the walls, who broke in on more than one occasion to lay waste the foreign colony.

During the late tenth and early eleventh centuries, the rise of the [[Brian Boru]] saw Waterford and a number of other Viking ports, being firmly brought under the control of the Ua Briain dynasty. This was important as it became increasingly obvious that the control of the Viking ports, gave potential Irish High Kings, greater access to international trade, and man power.

==Anglo Norman invasion and medieval Waterford==
The next phase in the life of Waterford began on August 25th, [[1170]] when the city was taken by the [[Normans]] under [[Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke|Strongbow]]. The Normans had been casting eyes in this direction for some time prior, until MacMurrough<U+2019>s invitation gave them cause for coming. In 1137, [[Diarmuid MacMorrough]], king of Leinster, failed in an attempt to take Waterford. He was trying to secure the large centres in order to advance his claim for high king of Ireland. In 1170 MacMorrough allied himself with [[Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke]] (Strongbow); together they besieged and took Waterford after a desperate defence. This was the introduction of the [[Anglo-Norman]]s into Ireland. In 1171, [[Henry II of England]] became the first English king to set foot in an Irish city, by landing with a large fleet at Waterford; he did so to ensure that Ireland became an English colony and not a rival Norman country. Waterford and Dublin were declared royal cities, and belonged to the king, not Strongbow; [[Dublin]] was declared capital of Ireland. The next royal visitor, in [[1185]], was prince John, who granted the city's first [[Charter]] in [[1205]] thus starting City Government in Waterford.  He revisited the city as king in [[1211]].  [[Richard II of England|Richard II]], too, visited Waterford twice, first in [[1394]] and again in [[1399]].

Throughout the medieval period, Waterford was Ireland's second city after Dublin. Waterford's great parchment book (1361-1649) represents the earliest use of the [[English language]] in Ireland for official purposes. 

In [[1487]] the city refused to obey the direction of the [[Earl of Kildare]] to recognise [[Lambert Simnel]] as king and ten years later repulsed a second pretender, [[Perkin Warbeck]]. As a result, King [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] gave the city its motto: ''Urbs Intacta Manet Waterfordia (Waterford remains the untaken city)''. [[Printing]] was introduced into Waterford in [[1550]], the first book being printed in the city five years later. It was in [[1588]] that [[Duncannon]] was fortified as a precaution against Spanish attacks along the coast, which were being experienced at the time.

===Area and extent - the city walls===
Until recently there was no record of the extent of any settlement that may have existed at Waterford prior to the middle of the 9th century. The Danish colony founded about that time ([[853]] A.D.) was triangular in shape and contained 15 acres approximately. This area was enclosed by stout ramparts linking Reginald's Tower with St. Martin's Castle (site in Spring Garden Alley); from thence running to Turgesius' Tower, which stood in the immediate vicinity of the Allied Irish Bank (corner of Barronstrand St.) and returning along the river-front to Reginald's Tower. 

Substantial remains of the wall in the 500 metre stretch between Reginald's Tower and St. Martin's Castle still exist, except where broken by the erection of the City Hall and the opening of Colbeck Street (former (Colbeck Gate). These traces may be observed between the houses of the Mall and Bailey's New Street and, further up, between Spring Garden Alley and Lady Lane, about 12 metres back from the northern frontage of the former. In the old handball alley, some four metres of the Wall<U+2014>in places six metres high<U+2014>stand exposed. Also, parts of the breastwork of St. Martin's Castle have been incorporated in the foundations and lower courses of the buildings that now stand on its former site.

There are a few traces at the wall linking St. Martin's Castle with Turgesius' Tower, and which followed the line of Michael Street and Broad Street, about sixteen to twenty metres back from the present eastern frontage of these streets. 

The wall fronting the Quay has completely disappeared. It was demolished and the material thrown down to form the foundation of the present Quays, partly under the [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland|Cromwellian]] Commissioners in [[1650]] and totally by the Corporation of [[1705]], which improved and enlarged the Quays.

==Religious war and upheavals==
Waterford was occupied by [[Charles Blount, 1st Earl of Devon|Mountjoy]] in [[1603]] during the [[Nine Years War (Ireland)]] a rebellion led by [[Hugh O'Neill]], ostensibly in the cause of Irish freedom and the Catholic religion. Despite their own adherence to Catholicism, the townspeople largely sided with the English government forces.  However, upon the coronation of [[James VI]] of Scotland as king of England in 1603, the citizens participated in an uprising that was common to the coastal cities of Munster and refused entry to Mountjoy, the king's [[Lord Deputy of Ireland]], who had just secured the surrender of [[Hugh O'Neill]]. The motivation for Waterford's defiance lay in the people's demand for freedom of religion - they were led by Catholic priests and re-consecrated several churches in the city - although there were also mutterings about the nationality of the new king. After negotiations, [[Lord Mountjoy]] was granted entry to the city and the citizens pledged their loyalty anew.

However, Waterford's [[Roman Catholic]] population became deeply alienated from the English Protestant state in Ireland in the following 40 years. After the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641]], Waterford was a centre of support for the [[Confederate Ireland|Confederate Catholics of Ireland]] - a de facto independent Irish state formed to fight for Irish Catholic interests in the [[Irish Confederate Wars]]. Within the Confederation, Waterford was known for its militant Catholic politics - rejecting an alliance signed between the Confederates and [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] that would have sent Irish troops to fight for the King in the [[English Civil War]]. Waterford was visited by the [[Papal Nuncio]] to Ireland, [[Giovanni Battista Rinuccini]] in [[1648]]. The latter, in his "Report on the Affairs of Ireland" sent to [[Pope Innocent X]], described Waterford as being "one of the only two Irish cities he would place in the front rank for reverence to the [[Holy See]]." In [[1649]] during the [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland]], the city was unsuccessfully besieged by [[Oliver Cromwell]], but was forced to surrender to his Deputy, [[Henry Ireton]], after a prolonged [[Siege of Waterford|siege]] in the summer of the following year. 

After the [[Battle of the Boyne]] in 1690, both [[James II of England|James II]] and [[William III of England|William of Orange]] came by Waterford, James on his way to France and William returning to England. It was soon after this, about [[1700]], that the [[Huguenots]] came to Waterford, sponsored by the English Protestant regime.

==18th century Waterford==
The 18th century was a period of huge prosperity for Waterford. Most of the city's best architecture appeared during this time. Trading with [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] brought much wealth into what was then the third largest port. 

One of the most important dates in Waterford's history is 1783. In that year George and William Penrose founded a glass factory. So began [[Waterford Crystal]] for which the city is so famous.

There was no armed uprising in the neighbourhood as part of the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|1798 Rebellion]], the probability of such being set aside by the rebel defeat at [[Wexford]]. There was, however, considerable [[United Irishmen]] activity in the city and district, where secret recruitment had been going on apace. Among those arraigned for seditious activity at the time was the toll collector of the then five-year-old wooden bridge over the [[Suir]].

==Catholic Emancipation and Famine==
In [[1826]], Waterford returned Villiers Stuart to [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] against the opposition of Lord George Beresford, the outgoing candidate and powerful landowner in the district. Stuart was put forward by [[Daniel O'Connell]]'s Catholic Association and O'Connell personally led his campaign here. Though not a [[Roman Catholic]] himself, Stuart was a man of [[liberal]] views and his election was an important step in the way to [[Catholic Emancipation]] which came three years later. 

The [[Irish Potato Famine (1845-1849)|Great Famine]] of [[1846]]-[[1848]] made itself felt in the city and the Corporation records of the period refer to several money grants to relieve the distress of the people.  The fact that there were large quantities of rice in Waterford saved the city from the worst effects of disastrous shortage in the normal food supply.

==Waterford 1850-1923==
In the 19th century, great industries such as glass making and ship building thrived in the city. [[Thomas Francis Meagher]] (Meagher of the sword), an [[Irish nationalist]], made the first [[Flag of Ireland|Irish tricolour]]. He brought it back from France and it was first flown from a building on the Mall in Waterford. 

In the early 20th century [[John Redmond]] was MP for Waterford and leader of the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]], which almost achieved home rule and a new parliament for Ireland.

===The Irish Civil War===
After the evacuation of British troops  (Devon Regiment) from Waterford  city at the end of the [[Irish War of Independence]],the military barracks was occupied by the  Waterford Flying Column, under the leadership of George Lennon of Dungarvan, which was part of the combined (1921)Waterford Brigade, Pax Whelan, Dungarvan, Officer Commanding.Like most active members of Oglaigh na hEireann (IRA) these men opposed   the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] of 1922 and, therefore, took the Republican side  when the [[Irish Civil War]] broke out at the Four Courts in late  June 1922. 

Republicans considered Waterford to be the eastern stronghold of the "[[Munster Republic]]", and linchpin of the 'Limerick-Waterford line'. In late July 1922, therefore, [[Irish Army|National Army]] troops under Major General [[John T. Prout]], composed of 700 men, one 18 pounder artillery piece and 4 [[armoured cars]] arrived from [[Kilkenny]] to re-take the city as part of a [[Irish Free State offensive 1922 -Irish Civil War|national offensive]]. Prout's second in command was Patrick Paul, who had been deposed by Liam Lynch  in 1921 as  commander of the IRA in  East Waterford. Arrested by his former comrades for supporting the Free State, he escaped,disguised as a nun, to join the  government  forces in Kilkenny.

The Republicans had chosen to defend the city along the southern bank of the river Suir, occupying the military barracks, the prison and the Post Office. Prout placed his artillery on Mount Misery overlooking their positions and bombarded the Republicans until they were forced to evacuate the barracks and prison. However the gun had to be brought down to Ferrybank to fire over open sights before the Republicans adandoned the Post Office. Some street fighting followed before the Irregulars abandoned the city and retreated westward  to Mount Congreve in [[Kilmeadan]].

==Modern Waterford, 1923-2005==
Waterford's importance in indepenent Ireland was as a port and a local centre of industry. Notable industries included the famous [[Waterford Crystal]] factory, employing 3,300 skilled employees at one time. The city was also a major [[railway]] terminus.
