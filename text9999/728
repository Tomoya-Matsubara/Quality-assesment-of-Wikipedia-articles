'''SMS ''Emden''''' ("His Majesty's Ship ''Emden''"){{efn|name=SMS|}} was the second and final member of the {{sclass|Dresden|cruiser|4}} of [[light cruiser]]s built for the [[Imperial German Navy]] (''Kaiserliche Marine''). Named for the town of [[Emden]], she was laid down at the [[Kaiserliche Werft Danzig|Kaiserliche Werft]] (Imperial Dockyard) in [[Danzig]] in 1906. Her hull was launched in May 1908, and completed in July 1909. She had one sister ship, {{SMS|Dresden|1907|2}}. Like the preceding [[K<U+00F6>nigsberg-class cruiser (1905)|''K<U+00F6>nigsberg''-class cruisers]], ''Emden'' was armed with ten {{convert|10.5|cm|abbr=on}} guns and two [[torpedo tube]]s.

''Emden'' spent the majority of her career overseas in the [[German East Asia Squadron]], based in [[Tsingtao]], in the [[Kiautschou Bay concession]] in China. In 1913, she came under the command of [[Karl von M<U+00FC>ller]], who would captain the ship during [[World War I]]. At the outbreak of hostilities, ''Emden'' captured a Russian steamer and converted her into the [[commerce raider]] {{SMS|Cormoran|1909|2}}. ''Emden'' rejoined the East Asia Squadron, after which she was detached for independent raiding in the [[Indian Ocean]]. The cruiser spent nearly two months operating in the region, and captured nearly two dozen ships. In late October 1914, ''Emden'' launched a surprise attack on [[Penang]]; in the resulting [[Battle of Penang]], she sank the Russian cruiser [[Russian cruiser Zhemchug|''Zhemchug'']] and the French [[destroyer]] [[French destroyer Mousquet|''Mousquet'']].

M<U+00FC>ller then took ''Emden'' to raid the [[Cocos Islands]], where he landed a contingent of sailors to destroy British facilities. There, ''Emden'' was attacked by the Australian cruiser {{HMAS|Sydney|1912|6}}. The more powerful Australian ship quickly inflicted serious damage and forced M<U+00FC>ller to [[Ship grounding|run his ship aground]] to prevent her from sinking. Out of a crew of 376, 133 were killed in the battle. Most of the survivors were taken prisoner, though the landing party, led by [[Hellmuth von M<U+00FC>cke]] commandeered an old [[schooner]] and eventually returned to Germany. ''Emden''{{'}}s wreck was quickly destroyed by wave action, but was not broken up for scrap until the 1950s.

{{main|Dresden class cruiser}}
''Emden'' was {{convert|118.3|m|sp=us}} [[length overall|long overall]] and had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|13.5|m|abbr=on}} and a [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|5.53|m|abbr=on}} forward. She displaced {{convert|4268|t|LT|abbr=on}} at full combat load. Her propulsion system consisted of two [[Marine steam engine#Triple or multiple expansion|triple-expansion steam engines]], designed to give {{convert|13500|ihp|lk=in}} for a top speed of {{convert|23.5|kn|lk=in}}. The engines were powered by twelve coal-fired Marine-type [[water-tube boiler]]s and drove a pair of [[screw propeller]]s. ''Emden'' carried up to {{convert|860|t|LT}} of coal, which gave her a range of {{convert|3760|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|12|kn}}. She had a crew of 18 officers and 343 enlisted men.<ref name=G105>Gr<U+00F6>ner, p. 105</ref><ref name=F2>Forstmeier, p. 2</ref> ''Emden'' was the last German cruiser to be equipped with triple-expansion engines; all subsequent cruisers used the more powerful [[steam turbine]]s.<ref>Gardiner & Gray, pp. 159&ndash;163</ref>

The ship was armed with ten [[10.5 cm SK L/40 naval gun|10.5&nbsp;cm SK L/40 guns]] in single mounts. Two were placed side by side forward on the [[forecastle]], six were located amidships, three on either side, and two were placed side by side aft. The guns could engage targets out to {{convert|12200|m|abbr=on}}. They were supplied with 1,500 rounds of ammunition, for 150 shells per gun. She was also equipped with two {{convert|50|cm|abbr=on|1}} [[torpedo tube]]s with four [[torpedo]]es, mounted on the deck. She was also fitted to carry fifty [[naval mine]]s. The ship was protected by an armored deck that was up to {{convert|80|mm|abbr=on}} thick. The [[conning tower]] had {{convert|100|mm|abbr=on}} thick sides, and the guns were protected by {{convert|50|mm|abbr=on}} thick shields.<ref name=G105/>

==Service history==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 137-001329, Tsingtau, SMS "Emden" I im Hafen.jpg|thumb|''Emden'' in [[Tsingtao]] in early 1914]]
The contract for ''Emden'', ordered as ''[[Ersatz]]'' (replacement) {{SMS|Pfeil}},{{efn|name=provisional names}} was placed on 6 April 1906 at the [[Kaiserliche Werft Danzig|Kaiserliche Werft]] (Imperial Dockyard) in [[Danzig]].<ref>Van der Vat, p. 17</ref> Her keel was laid down on 1 November 1906. She was launched on 26 May 1908 and christened by the ''[[Lord Mayor|Oberb<U+00FC>rgermeister]]'' (Lord Mayor) of her namesake city, Dr. [[Leo F<U+00FC>rbringer]].<ref name=HRS39>Hildebrand, R<U+00F6>hr, & Steinmetz, p. 39</ref> After [[fitting-out]] work was completed by 10 July 1909, she was commissioned into the fleet.<ref name=GG157>Gardiner & Gray, p. 157</ref> The new cruiser began her [[sea trial]]s that day, though they were interrupted from 11 August to 5 September when she participated in the annual autumn maneuvers of the main fleet. During this period, she also served as the escort for [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]] aboard his yacht [[SMY Hohenzollern|''Hohenzollern'']]. ''Emden'' was decommissioned in September after she completed her trials.<ref name=HRS39/>

On 1 April 1910 ''Emden'' was reactivated and assigned to the [[German East Asia Squadron|''Ostasiengeschwader'']] (East Asia Squadron), based at [[Qingdao|Tsingtao]] in Germany's [[Jiaozhou Bay concession|Kiautschou concession]] in China.<ref name=HRS39/> The concession had been seized in 1897 in retaliation for the murder of German nationals in the area.<ref>Gottschall, pp. 156&ndash;157</ref> ''Emden'' left [[Kiel]] on 12 April 1910, bound for Asia by way of a goodwill tour of South America.<ref name=HRS39/><ref>Van der Vat, p. 18</ref> A month later, on 12 May, she stopped in [[Montevideo]] and met with the cruiser {{SMS|Bremen||2}}, which was assigned to the ''Ostamerikanischen'' (East American) Station. ''Emden'' and ''Bremen'' stayed in [[Buenos Aires]] from 17 to 30 May to represent Germany at the celebrations of the hundredth anniversary of Argentinian independence. The two ships then rounded [[Cape Horn]]; ''Emden'' stopped in [[Valpara<U+00ED>so]], Chile, while ''Bremen'' continued on to Peru.<ref name=HRS39/>

The cruise across the Pacific was delayed because of a lack of good quality coal. ''Emden'' eventually took on around {{convert|1400|MT|sp=us|abbr=on}} of coal at the Chilean naval base at [[Talcahuano]] and departed on 24 June. The cruise was used to evaluate the ship on long-distance voyages for use in future light cruiser designs. ''Emden'' encountered unusually severe weather on the trip, which included a stop at [[Easter Island]]. She anchored at [[Papeete]], [[Tahiti]] to coal on 12 July, her bunkers nearly empty after crossing {{convert|4200|nmi}}. The ship then proceeded to [[Apia]] in [[German Samoa]], arriving on 22 July. There, she met the rest of the East Asia Squadron, commanded by ''[[Konteradmiral]]'' (Rear Admiral) [[Erich G<U+00FC>hler]]. The squadron remained in Samoa until October, when the ships returned to their base at Tsingtao. ''Emden'' was thereafter sent to the [[Yangtze River]] from 27 October to 19 November, which included a visit to [[Hankou]]. The ship visited [[Nagasaki]], Japan, before returning to Tsingtao on 22 December for her annual refit.<ref name=HRS39/> The repair work was not carried out, however, since the [[Sokehs Rebellion]] erupted on [[Pohnpei|Ponape]] in the [[Caroline Islands|Carolines]], which required ''Emden''{{'}}s presence; she departed Tsingtao on 28 December, and {{SMS|N<U+00FC>rnberg||2}} left [[Hong Kong]] to join her.<ref>Hildebrand, R<U+00F6>hr, & Steinmetz, pp. 39&ndash;40</ref><ref>Van der Vat, p. 19</ref>

[[File:Karl von M<U+00FC>ller.jpg|thumb|upright|Karl von M<U+00FC>ller, who served as the ship's commanding officer from 1913]]
The two cruisers reinforced German forces at Ponape, which included the old [[unprotected cruiser]] {{SMS|Cormoran|1892|2}}. The ships bombarded rebel positions and sent a landing force, which included men from the ships along with colonial police troops, ashore in mid-January 1911. By the end of February the revolt had been suppressed, and on 26 February the unprotected cruiser {{SMS|Condor||2}} arrived to take over the German presence in the Carolines. ''Emden'' and the other ships held a funeral the following day for those killed in the operation, before departing on 1 March for Tsingtao via Guam. After arriving on 19 March, she finally began her yearly overhaul. In mid-1911, the ship went on a cruise to Japan, but while there she accidentally rammed a Japanese steamer during a [[typhoon]]. The collision caused significant damage and necessitated another trip to the drydock in Tsingtao. She thereafter returned to the Yangtze to protect Europeans during the [[Xinhai Revolution|Chinese Revolution]] that broke out on 10 October.<ref name=HRS40>Hildebrand, R<U+00F6>hr, & Steinmetz, p. 40</ref> In November, ''[[Vizeadmiral]]'' (Vice Admiral) [[Maximilian von Spee]] replaced G<U+00FC>hler as the commander of the East Asia Squadron.<ref>Hough, p. 8</ref>

At the end of the year, ''Emden'' won the Kaiser's ''Schie<U+00DF>preis'' (Shooting Prize) for excellent gunnery in the East Asia Squadron. In early December, ''Emden'' steamed to [[Incheon]] to assist the grounded German steamer ''Deike Rickmers''.<ref name=HRS40/> In May 1913, ''[[Korvettenkapit<U+00E4>n]]'' (Corvette Captain) [[Karl von M<U+00FC>ller]] became the ship's commanding officer; he was shortly thereafter promoted to ''[[Fregattenkapit<U+00E4>n]]'' (Frigate Captain).<ref name=F2/><ref name=HRS41>Hildebrand, R<U+00F6>hr, & Steinmetz, p. 41</ref> In mid-June, ''Emden'' went on a cruise to the German colonies in the Central Pacific, after which she was stationed off [[Nanjing]], as fighting between Qing and revolutionary forces raged there. During this period, on 26 August, rebels attacked the ship, but ''Emden''{{'}}s gunners immediately returned fire and silenced her attackers. ''Emden'' moved to [[Shanghai]] on 14 August.<ref>Hildebrand, R<U+00F6>hr, & Steinmetz, pp. 40&ndash;41</ref>

===World War I===
''Emden'' spent the first half of 1914 on the normal routine of cruises in Chinese and Japanese waters without incident.<ref name=HRS41/> During the [[July Crisis]] that followed the [[assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria]], ''Emden'' was the only German cruiser in Tsingtao; Spee's two [[armored cruiser]]s, {{SMS|Scharnhorst||2}} and {{SMS|Gneisenau||2}}, were cruising in the South Pacific and {{SMS|Leipzig||2}} was en route to replace ''N<U+00FC>rnberg'' off the coast of Mexico. On 31 July, with war days away, M<U+00FC>ller decided to put to sea to begin commerce raiding once war had been formally declared. Two days later, on 2 August, Germany declared war on Russia, and the following day, ''Emden'' captured the Russian steamer ''Ryazan''. The Russian vessel was sent back to Tsingtao, where she was converted into the [[auxiliary cruiser]] {{SMS|Cormoran|1909|2}}.<ref>Forstmeier, pp. 3&ndash;4</ref><ref>Staff ''Battle on the Seven Seas'', p. 29</ref>

On 5 August, Spee ordered M<U+00FC>ller to join him at [[Pagan (island)|Pagan Island]] in the [[Mariana Islands]]; ''Emden'' left Tsingtao the following day along with the auxiliary cruiser [[SS Prinz Eitel Friedrich (1904)|''Prinz Eitel Friedrich'']] and the [[collier (ship)|collier]] {{SS|Markomannia|1911|2}}. The ships arrived in Pagan on 12 August.<ref>Forstmeier, p. 4</ref> The next day, Spee learned that Japan would enter the war on the side of the [[Triple Entente]] and had dispatched a fleet to track his squadron down. Spee therefore decided to take the East Asia Squadron to South America, where it could attempt to break through to Germany, harassing British merchant traffic along the way.<ref>Forstmeier, p. 5</ref> M<U+00FC>ller suggested that one cruiser be detached for independent operations in the [[Indian Ocean]], since the squadron would be unable to attack British shipping while it was crossing the Pacific. Spee agreed, and allowed M<U+00FC>ller to operate independently, since ''Emden'' was the fastest cruiser in the squadron.<ref>Forstmeier, pp. 5&ndash;6</ref>

====Independent raider====
[[File:Cruise of the Emden 1914 Map.png|thumb|400px|Route taken by ''Emden'' during her commerce raiding operations]]
On 14 August, ''Emden'' and ''Markomannia'' left the company of the East Asia Squadron, bound for the Indian Ocean. Since the cruiser {{SMS|K<U+00F6>nigsberg|1905|2}} was already operating in the western Indian Ocean around the [[Gulf of Aden]], M<U+00FC>ller decided he should cruise in the shipping lanes between [[Singapore]], [[Colombo]], and [[Aden]]. ''Emden'' steamed toward the Indian Ocean by way of the [[Molucca Sea|Molucca]] and [[Banda Sea]]s. While seeking to coal off [[Jampea Island]], the Dutch [[coastal defense ship]] [[HNLMS Maarten Harpertszoon Tromp|''Tromp'']] stopped ''Emden'' and made clear that she would enforce Dutch neutrality. M<U+00FC>ller therefore decided to steam into the [[Lombok Strait]]. There, ''Emden''{{'}}s radio-intercept officers picked up messages from the British armored cruiser {{HMS|Hampshire|1903|6}}. To maintain secrecy, ''Emden''{{'}}s crew rigged up a dummy funnel to give her the appearance of a British light cruiser. She then steamed up the coast of [[Sumatra]] toward the Indian Ocean.<ref>Forstmeier, pp. 6&ndash;8</ref>

On 5 September, ''Emden'' entered the [[Bay of Bengal]],<ref>Forstmeier, p. 8</ref> achieving complete surprise, since the British assumed she was still with Spee's squadron.<ref name=H75>Halpern, p. 75</ref> She operated on shipping routes there without success, until 10 September, when she moved to the Colombo&ndash;[[Calcutta]] route. There, she captured the Greek collier ''Pontoporros'', which was carrying equipment for the British. M<U+00FC>ller took the ship into his service and agreed to pay the crew. ''Emden'' captured five more ships; four were sunk, and the fifth, a steamer named ''Kabinga'', was used to carry the crews from the other vessels. On 13 September, M<U+00FC>ller released ''Kabinga'' and sank two more British [[Prize (law)|prizes]]. Off the [[Ganges]] estuary, ''Emden'' caught a Norwegian merchantman; upon searching her, the Germans determined she was not carrying [[contraband]] and therefore released her. The Norwegians informed M<U+00FC>ller that Entente warships were operating in the area, and so he decided to return to the eastern coast of India.<ref name=F10>Forstmeier, p. 10</ref>

''Emden'' thereafter stopped and released an Italian freighter, whose crew relayed news of the incident to a British vessel, which in turn informed British naval authorities in the region. The result was an immediate cessation of shipping and the institution of a [[Blackout (wartime)|blackout]]. [[Vice Admiral]] [[Martyn Jerram]] ordered ''Hampshire'', {{HMS|Yarmouth|1911|2}}, and the Japanese [[protected cruiser]] [[Japanese cruiser Chikuma (1911)|''Chikuma'']] to search for ''Emden''. The British armored cruiser {{HMS|Minotaur|1906|2}} and the Japanese armored cruiser [[Japanese battlecruiser Ibuki|''Ibuki'']] were sent to patrol likely coaling stations.<ref name=F10/>

[[File:Bombardment of Madras by S.S. Emden 1914.jpg|thumb|left|Oil tanks burning at [[Madras]]]]
In late September, M<U+00FC>ller decided to [[bombardment of Madras|bombard Madras]]. M<U+00FC>ller believed the attack would demonstrate his freedom of maneuver and decrease British prestige with the local population. At around 20:00 on 22 September, ''Emden'' entered the port, which was completely illuminated, despite the blackout order. ''Emden'' closed to within {{convert|3000|yd}} from the piers before she opened fire. She set fire to two oil tanks and damaged three others, and damaged a merchant ship in the harbor. In the course of the bombardment, ''Emden'' had fired 130&nbsp;rounds. The following day, the British again mandated that shipping stop in the Bay of Bengal; during the first month of ''Emden''{{'}}s raiding career in the Indian Ocean, the value of exports there had fallen by 61.2&nbsp;percent.<ref name=F10/>

From Madras, M<U+00FC>ller had originally intended to rendezvous with his colliers off [[Simalur Island]] in Indonesia, but he instead decided to make a foray to the western side of Ceylon. On 25 September, ''Emden'' sank a pair of British merchantmen and two days later, captured the collier ''Buresk'', which was carrying a cargo of high-grade coal. A German [[prize crew]] went aboard ''Buresk'' and she was thereafter used to support ''Emden''{{'}}s operations. Later that day, the German raider sank two more British vessels. Low on fuel, ''Emden'' proceeded to the [[Maldives]] to coal. She arrived there on 29 September and remained for a day while her crew replenished her coal stocks. The raider then cruised the routes between Aden and Australia and between Calcutta and [[Mauritius]] for two days without success. ''Emden'' thereafter steamed to [[Diego Garcia]] for engine maintenance and to rest her crew.<ref name=F10/>

Curiously, the British garrison at Diego Garcia had not yet learned of the state of war between Britain and Germany, and so treated ''Emden'' to a warm reception. She remained there until 10 October, during which time her bottom was cleaned of [[fouling]]. She then resumed searching for merchant ships in the area west of Colombo. While operating there, ''Emden'' picked up ''Hampshire''{{'}}s wireless signals again, and so departed for the [[Chagos Archipelago]] on 13 October.<ref name=F11/> Meanwhile, the British had captured ''Markomannia'' on 12 October, depriving ''Emden'' of one of her colliers.<ref name=H75/> On 15 October, ''Emden'' captured a British steamer off [[Minikoi]] and sank her the next day. Over the next five days, she captured five more vessels; one was used as a collier, three were sunk, and the fifth was sent to port with the crews of the other vessels. On 20 October, M<U+00FC>ller decided it was time to move to a new area of operations.<ref name=F11>Forstmeier, p. 11</ref>

====Attack on Penang====
[[File:When the Emden Raided Penang, Map, fromThe New York Times, Dec.jpg|thumb|Map showing ''Emden''{{'}}s movements during the battle]]
{{main|Battle of Penang}}
M<U+00FC>ller decided his next course of action would be a surprise attack on [[Penang]] in [[British Malaya]]. ''Emden'' coaled in the [[Nicobar Islands]] and departed for Penang on the night of 27 October, with the departure timed to allow her to arrive off the harbor at dawn. She approached the harbor entrance at 03:00 on 28 October, steaming at a speed of {{convert|18|kn|abbr=on}}, with her fourth dummy funnel erected to disguise her identity. ''Emden''{{'}}s lookouts quickly spotted a warship in the port with her lights illuminated; it turned out to be the Russian protected cruiser [[Russian cruiser Zhemchug|''Zhemchug'']],<ref name=F11/> a veteran of the [[Battle of Tsushima]].<ref>Willmott, p. 118</ref> ''Zhemchug'' had put into Penang for repairs to her boilers; only one was in service, which meant that she could not get underway, nor were her ammunition hoists powered. Only five rounds of ready ammunition were permitted for each gun, with a sixth chambered.<ref>Staff ''Battle on the Seven Seas'', p. 128</ref> ''Emden'' pulled alongside ''Zhemchug'' at a distance of {{convert|300|yd}}; M<U+00FC>ller ordered a torpedo to be fired at the Russian cruiser. Immediately thereafter, he gave the order for the 10.5&nbsp;cm guns to open fire.<ref name=F11/>

''Emden'' quickly inflicted grievous damage on her adversary; she turned around to make another pass at ''Zhemchug''. One of the Russian gun crews managed to get their weapon into action, but scored no hits. M<U+00FC>ller ordered a second torpedo to be fired into the burning ''Zhemchug'' while his guns continued to batter her.<ref name=F11/> The second torpedo caused a tremendous explosion that tore the ship apart. By the time the smoke cleared, ''Zhemchug'' had already slipped beneath the waves, her masts the only parts of the ship still above water.<ref name=F14/> The destruction of ''Zhemchug'' killed 81 Russian sailors and wounded 129, of whom seven later died of their injuries. The elderly French cruiser [[French cruiser D'Iberville|''D'Iberville'']] and the [[destroyer]] [[French destroyer Fronde|''Fronde'']] opened fire on ''Emden'', but their shots were wildly inaccurate.<ref name=S131>Staff ''Battle on the Seven Seas'', p. 131</ref>

M<U+00FC>ller then decided to depart, owing to the risk of encountering superior warships. Upon leaving the harbor, he encountered a British freighter, {{SS|Glen Turret}}, loaded with ammunition, that had already stopped to pick up a [[maritime pilot|harbor pilot]]. While preparing to take possession of the ship, ''Emden'' had to recall her boats when she spotted an approaching ship. This proved to be the French destroyer [[French destroyer Mousquet|''Mousquet'']], but the unprepared ship was quickly destroyed. ''Emden'' stopped to pick up survivors from ''Mousquet'' and departed at around 08:00 as the other French ships were raising steam in preparation to get underway.<ref>Corbett, pp. 337<U+2013>338</ref> One officer and thirty-five sailors were plucked from the water. Another French destroyer tried to follow, but lost sight of the German raider in a rainstorm. On 30 October, ''Emden'' stopped the British steamer ''Newburn'' and put the French sailors aboard her after they signed statements promising not to return to the war.<ref name=F14>Forstmeier, p. 14</ref><ref>Staff ''Battle on the Seven Seas'', p. 132</ref> The attack on Penang was a significant shock to the Entente powers, and caused them to delay the large convoys from Australia, since they would need more powerful escorts.<ref>Halpern, pp. 75&ndash;76</ref>

====Battle of Cocos====
[[File:Wn21-13.jpg|thumb|''Emden''{{'}}s landing party going ashore on [[Direction Island (Cocos (Keeling) Islands)|Direction Island]]; the three-masted ''Ayesha'' is visible in the background]]
{{main|Battle of Cocos}}
After releasing the British steamer, ''Emden'' turned south to Simalur, where she met the captured collier ''Buresk''.<ref name=F14/> M<U+00FC>ller then decided to attack the British coaling station in the [[Cocos Islands]]; he intended to destroy the wireless station there and draw away British forces searching for him in the Indian Ocean. While en route to the Cocos, ''Emden'' spent two days combing the [[Sunda Strait]] for merchant shipping, though without success. She thereafter proceeded to the Cocos, arriving off [[Direction Island (Cocos (Keeling) Islands)|Direction Island]] at 06:00 on the morning of 9 November. Since there were no British vessels in the area, M<U+00FC>ller sent ashore a landing party led by ''[[Kapit<U+00E4>nleutnant]]'' (First Lieutenant) [[Hellmuth von M<U+00FC>cke]], ''Emden''{{'}}s [[executive officer]]. The party consisted of another two officers, six non-commissioned officers, and thirty-eight sailors.<ref name=F16>Forstmeier, p. 16</ref>

Though ''Emden'' was using [[Radio jamming|jamming]], the British wireless station was able to transmit the message "Unidentified ship off entrance." The message was received by the Australian light cruiser {{HMAS|Sydney|1912|6}}, which was {{convert|52|nmi}} away, escorting a convoy. ''Sydney'' immediately headed for the Cocos Islands at top speed. ''Emden'' picked up wireless messages from the then unidentified vessel approaching, but believed her to be {{convert|250|nmi}} away, giving them much more time than they actually had. At 09:00, lookouts aboard ''Emden'' spotted a smoke cloud on the horizon, and thirty minutes later identified it as a warship approaching at high speed. M<U+00FC>cke's landing party was still ashore, and there was no time left to recover them.<ref name=F16/>

''Sydney'' closed to a distance of {{convert|9500|yd}} before turning to a parallel course with ''Emden''. The German cruiser opened fire first, and [[:wikt:straddle|straddled]] the Australian vessel with her third salvo.<ref name=F16/> ''Emden''{{'}}s gunners were firing rapidly, with a salvo every ten seconds; M<U+00FC>ller hoped to overwhelm ''Sydney'' with a barrage of shells before her heavier armament could take effect.<ref>Staff ''Battle on the Seven Seas'', p. 134</ref> Two shells hit ''Sydney'', one of which disabled the aft fire control station; the other failed to explode. It took slightly longer for ''Sydney'' to find the range, and in the meantime, ''Emden'' turned toward her opponent in an attempt to close to torpedo range. ''Sydney''{{'}}s more powerful {{convert|6|in|abbr=on|0}} guns soon found the range and inflicted serious damage.<ref name=F16/> The wireless compartment was destroyed and the crew for one of the forward guns was killed early in the engagement. At 09:45, M<U+00FC>ller turned his ship toward ''Sydney'' in another attempt to reach a torpedo firing position. Five minutes later, a shell hit disabled the steering gear, and other fragments jammed the hand steering equipment. ''Emden'' could only be steered with her propellers.

M<U+00FC>ller made a third attempt to close to torpedo range, but ''Sydney'' quickly turned away.<ref name=F19/> Shortly after 10:00, a shell from ''Sydney'' detonated ready ammunition near the starboard No. 4 gun and started a serious fire.<ref>Staff ''Battle on the Seven Seas'', p. 136</ref> A fourth and final attempt to launch a torpedo attack was made shortly thereafter, but ''Sydney'' was able to keep the range open.<ref name=S137>Staff ''Battle on the Seven Seas'', p. 137</ref> By 10:45, ''Emden''{{'}}s guns had largely gone silent; her [[superstructure]] had been shredded and the two rear-most funnels had been shot away, along with the foremast. M<U+00FC>ller realized that his ship was no longer able to fight, and so he decided to beach ''Emden'' on [[North Keeling Island]] to save the lives of his crew.<ref name=F19/> At 11:15, ''Emden'' was run onto the reef, and her engines and boilers were flooded. Her [[breech block]]s and torpedo aiming gear were thrown overboard to render the weapons unusable, and all signal books and secret papers were burned.<ref name=S137/> ''Sydney'' turned to capture the collier ''Buresk'', whose crew scuttled her when the Australian cruiser approached. ''Sydney'' then returned to the wrecked ''Emden'' and inquired if she surrendered. The signal books had been destroyed by fire and so the Germans could not reply, and since her flag was still flying, ''Sydney'' resumed fire. The Germans quickly raised [[white flag]]s and the Australians ceased fire.<ref name=F19/>

In the course of the action, ''Emden'' had scored sixteen hits on ''Sydney'', killing three of her crew and wounding another thirteen.<ref name=F20>Forstmeier, p. 20</ref> ''Sydney'' had meanwhile fired some 670&nbsp;rounds of ammunition, with around 100&nbsp;hits claimed.<ref>"Narrative of the Proceedings of H.M.A.S. Sydney", p. 459</ref> ''Emden'' had suffered much higher casualties: 133&nbsp;officers and enlisted men were killed,<ref name=G106>Gr<U+00F6>ner, p. 106</ref> out of a crew of 376. Most of her surviving crew, including M<U+00FC>ller, were taken into captivity the following day. The wounded men were sent to Australia, while the uninjured were interned at a camp in [[Malta]]; the men were returned to Germany in 1920.<ref>Staff ''Battle on the Seven Seas'', p. 138</ref><ref>Forstmeier, pp. 16&ndash;19</ref> M<U+00FC>cke's landing party, however, evaded capture. They had observed the battle, and realized that ''Emden'' would be destroyed. M<U+00FC>cke therefore ordered the old {{convert|97|MT|LT|sp=us|adj=on}} [[schooner]] ''Ayesha'' to be prepared for sailing. The Germans departed before ''Sydney'' reached Direction Island, and sailed to [[Padang]] in the Dutch East Indies. From there, they traveled to [[Yemen]], which was then part of the [[Ottoman Empire]], an ally of Germany. They then traveled overland to [[Constantinople]], arriving in June 1915. There, they reported to ''Vizeadmiral'' [[Wilhelm Souchon]], the commander of the ex-German [[battlecruiser]] {{SMS|Goeben||2}}.<ref name=F20/> In the meantime, the British [[sloop]] {{HMS|Cadmus|1903|2}} arrived at the Cocos Islands about a week after the battle to bury the sailors killed in the battle.<ref>Lochner, pp. 201&ndash;202</ref>

Over a raiding career spanning three months and {{convert|30000|nmi}},<ref name=F21>Forstmeier, p. 21</ref> ''Emden'' had destroyed two Entente warships and sank or captured sixteen British steamers and one Russian merchant ship, totaling {{GRT|70825|disp=long}}.<ref>Halpern, p. 76</ref> Another four British ships were captured and released, and one British and one Greek ship were used as colliers.<ref name=F21/> In 1915, a Japanese company proposed that ''Emden'' be repaired and refloated, but an inspection by the elderly [[flat-iron gunboat]] {{HMAS|Protector|1884|6}} concluded that wave damage to ''Emden'' made such an operation unfeasible. By 1919, there were reports that the wreck had almost completely broken up and disappeared beneath the waves.<ref>Jose, p. 207</ref> The wreck was eventually broken up ''[[in situ]]'' in the early 1950s by a Japanese salvage company, though parts of the ship remain scattered around the area.<ref name=G106/><ref>von M<U+00FC>cke, p. 96</ref>

Following the destruction of ''Emden'', Kaiser Wilhelm II awarded the [[Iron Cross]] to the ship and announced that a new {{SMS|Emden|1916|2}} would be built to honor the original cruiser. Wilhelm II ordered that the new cruiser wear a large Iron Cross on her bow to commemorate her namesake ship.<ref>Hoyt, p. 212</ref> The third cruiser to bear the name {{ship|German cruiser|Emden||2}}, built in the 1920s for the ''[[Reichsmarine]]'', also carried the Iron Cross, along with [[battle honor]]s for the Indian Ocean, Penang, Cocos Islands, and [[Saaremaa|<U+00D6>sel]],<ref>Koop & Schmolke, p. 69</ref> where the second ''Emden'' had engaged several Russian destroyers and torpedo boats.<ref>Staff ''Battle for the Baltic Islands'', pp. 22&ndash;28</ref> Two further vessels have been named for the cruiser in the West German ''[[Bundesmarine]]'': the {{sclass-|K<U+00F6>ln|frigate}} {{ship|German frigate|Emden|F221|2}} laid down in 1959,<ref>Hildebrand, R<U+00F6>hr, & Steinmetz, p. 60</ref> and the {{sclass-|Bremen|frigate|1}} {{ship|German frigate|Emden|F210|2}} laid down in 1979.<ref>Yates, p. 310</ref>

Three of the ship's 10.5&nbsp;cm guns were removed from the wreck three years after the battle. One is preserved in [[Hyde Park, Sydney|Hyde Park]] in Sydney, a second is located at [[HMAS Kuttabul (naval base)|HMAS Kuttabul]], the main naval base in Sydney, and the third is on display at the [[Australian War Memorial]] in [[Canberra]].<ref>Mehl, p. 82</ref> In addition, ''Emden''{{'}}s [[Ship's bell|bell]] and stern ornament were recovered from the wreck and both are currently in the collection of the Australian War Museum.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ship's bell from SMS Emden : HMAS Sydney (I)|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/collection/RELAWM12275/|accessdate=9 April 2014|publisher=Australian War Memorial}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Stern ornament : SMS Emden|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/collection/RELAWM11356/|accessdate=9 April 2014|publisher=Australian War Memorial}}</ref> A number of other artifacts, including a damaged 10.5&nbsp;cm shell case,<ref>{{cite web|title=Damaged 105mm cartridge case : SMS Emden|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/collection/REL/00378/|accessdate=9 April 2014|publisher=Australian War Memorial}}</ref> an iron [[rivet]] from the hull,<ref>{{cite web|title=Iron rivet from SMS Emden : Surgeon-Lieutenant A C R Todd, HMAS Sydney|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/collection/REL31590/|accessdate=9 April 2014|publisher=Australian War Memorial}}</ref> and uniforms were also recovered and are held in the Australian War Memorial.<ref>{{cite web|title=Junior NCOs and seamans blue and white cotton collar : SMS Emden, Kaiserliche Marine|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/collection/REL%2F10302.002/|accessdate=9 April 2014|publisher=Australian War Memorial}}</ref>

A number of films have been made about ''Emden''{{'}}s wartime exploits, including the 1915 movies ''[[How We Beat the Emden]]'' and ''[[How We Fought the Emden]]'' and the 1928 ''[[The Exploits of the Emden]]'', all produced in Australia.<ref>Pike & Cooper, p. 56</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article73720994 |title="THE EXPLOITS OF THE EMDEN.". |newspaper=[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser (Adelaide, SA : 1889 - 1931)]] |location=Adelaide, SA |date=10 November 1928 |accessdate=7 August 2012 |page=11 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> German films include the 1926 [[silent film]] [[Our Emden|''Unser Emden'']], footage from which was incorporated in [[Cruiser Emden|''Kreuzer Emden'']] of 1932,<ref>Kester, p. 32</ref> and ''[[Heldentum und Todeskampf unserer Emden]]'', produced in 1934.
