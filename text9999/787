'''''Zooropa''''' is the eighth studio album by the [[Republic of Ireland|Irish]] [[rock music|rock]] band [[U2]]. Originally intended as an [[Extended play|EP]],<ref>[http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/119445/review/5942533/zooropa U2 "Zooropa" - Rolling Stones]</ref> it was recorded between legs of the [[Zoo TV Tour]] and released on [[6 July]] [[1993]] by [[Island Records]] as a full-length album.  The album continues the band's experimentation with [[alternative rock]] and [[electronic music]] from their previous album ''[[Achtung Baby]]''. Much like that album, ''Zooropa'' was critically and commercially successful. The album's title is a [[portmanteau|combination]] of "Zoo TV" and "[[Europe|Europa]]."

==History==
''Zooropa'' was very much an "[[alternative rock]]" album in the climate of 1993. In [[North America]], [[grunge music|grunge]] was at its peak - meanwhile, U2 released an album without angst or even a single guitar solo. In [[Europe]], [[Britpop]] was beginning to conquer the charts, yet ''Zooropa'' owed more to the experimentation of [[David Bowie]] and [[Brian Eno]] than to the melodic pop of [[The Beatles]] and [[The Kinks]]. Brian Eno's primary credit is as a producer on this album, although he also appears as a performer/contributor on several of the songs, including "Babyface" and "Lemon".

''Zooropa'' was a successful release, riding the wave of popularity started by ''[[Achtung Baby]]'' and the Zoo TV Tour. It won a [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album|Best Alternative Music Album]] in the year of its release and spent two weeks at #1 on the [[Billboard 200]], despite lacking a strong single. It has subsequently sold 8 million copies worldwide.{{Fact|date=February 2008}}

As the title suggests, the album has a distinctly [[Culture of Europe|European]] texture (in contrast to the distinctly American roots of their late eighties work), continuing the band's experimentation with [[electronica]], [[techno]], and other predominantly European forms of music. Heavy on samples and irony, it also ties the "media overload" themes of the Zoo TV Tour into the context of a post-[[Berlin Wall]] Europe. The lyrics touch on how [[technology]] unites as well as separates us.{{Fact|date=February 2008}} The title track, for instance, contains ad slogans such as "Better by design", "Be All That You Can Be" and "[[Vorsprung durch Technik]]."

On the techno-rap "Numb", guitarist [[The Edge]]'s drones a list of "don'ts," overwhelmed by a noisy backdrop of "arcade sounds"<ref>"Zooropa" Linear Notes</ref> and "fat lady vocals."<ref>"Zooropa" Linear Notes</ref> The Edge notes that the inspiration for this song came from "that sense that you were getting bombarded with so much that you actually were finding yourself shutting down and unable to respond because there was so much imagery and information being thrown at you."<ref>[http://www.geocities.com/cirrusminor9/html/zooinfo.htm The Three Sunrises has moved!<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

"Lemon", sung by [[Bono]] in a longing falsetto and played by The Edge amidst waves of almost unrecognisably distorted guitar, documents man's futile attempts to preserve time through technology, as well as the importance of private voyeurism to a band living in a constant spotlight (the song was actually about a film-to-video transfer received by Bono from some family friends; in the video, his mother was seen wearing a lemon-yellow dress, hence the title and subject matter).<ref>{{cite web|title = U2 MoL - Zooropa - Lemon|url = http://hem.bredband.net/steverud/U2MoL/Zooropa/lemon.html| accessdate = 2006-12-20 }}</ref>

The closing track, "The Wanderer", features [[country music]] legend [[Johnny Cash]] on lead vocals. His haggard voice sings over a wobbly synthesiser  line, a bizarre juxtaposition in line with the album's central irony: that the band's most synthesized and [[postmodernity|postmodern]] album would be a condemnation of technology.<ref>[http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/119445/review/5942533/zooropa U2 "Zooropa" - Rolling Stones]</ref> The song's narrator wanders through a soulless world "in search of experience", ultimately finding meaning in the spiritual rather than the superficial.

A "hidden track" after "The Wanderer" features a ringing alarm similar to that which [[disc jockey]]s hear when there is 10 seconds of dead air.

"Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me" was used in the 1995 film [[Batman Forever]] and included on the [[Batman Forever (soundtrack)|''Batman Forever'' soundtrack]]. "Wake Up Dead Man", and "If You Wear That Velvet Dress" were included on the 1997 ''[[Pop (album)|Pop]]'' album.

==Singles==
The first single "Numb" was an unconventional choice for a first single, and was released exclusively on [[VHS]] as a "[[video single]]". The single very much reflects the avant-gardism and obsession with multimedia that marked both the album and the accompanying [[Zoo TV Tour|Zoo TV]] world tour. It was Directed by Kevin Godley. Three more conventional singles were released from the album; "Lemon" received a limited release in North America, Australia, and Japan; "Stay (Faraway, So Close)" was released worldwide, and "[[Zooropa (song)|Zooropa]]" was released as a promotional single in Mexico and the United States.

==Live==
Much of the album was performed on the [[Zoo TV Tour]], with the exceptions of "[[Some Days Are Better Than Others]]" and "[[The Wanderer (U2 song)|The Wanderer]]."

"[[Lemon (song)|Lemon]]" and "[[Daddy's Gonna Pay For Your Crashed Car]]" were performed with Bono in his MacPhisto persona, during encores of the Zoomerang Leg of the tour. "[[Dirty Day]]" was also played on this leg after the acoustic set. "[[Numb (U2 song)|Numb]]" was performed with The Edge playing guitar and on lead vocals, with Larry Mullen Jr. performing backing vocals while drumming. "[[Zooropa (song)|Zooropa]]" and "[[Babyface]]" were performed three times each, at the same shows on the ''Zooropa'' leg, but were cut out of the setlist after the band didn't feel they sounded right live.  "[[Stay (Faraway, So Close!)]]" was performed acoustically for the ''Zooropa'' and ''Zoomerang'' legs.

"The First Time" has been played multiple times on the [[Vertigo Tour]], and "The Wanderer" was performed by the band in a tribute to Johnny Cash, with Bono taking the vocals Cash once held. "Some Days Are Better Than Others" is the only ''Zooropa'' track not performed live.
