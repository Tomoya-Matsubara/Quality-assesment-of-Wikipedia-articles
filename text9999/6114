'''Beetham Tower Manchester''', also known as '''Hilton Manchester''' and '''Hilton Tower''', is a mixed-use [[skyscraper]] in [[Manchester]], [[England]]. Built in 2006, it is named after the developers, [[Beetham Organization]], was designed by [[Ian Simpson]] and was built by [[Carillion]].<ref name="skyscrapernews" /> It is the [[List of tallest buildings and structures in Manchester|tallest building in Manchester]] by a significant margin. It consists of a [[Hilton Hotel]] up to level 23 and apartments from level 25 upwards.<ref name="bbc_height" /> There are also 2 basement levels which contain car parking for the residents of the apartments.

The tower lies on [[Deansgate]] and has two postal addresses, with the apartments falling under ''301 Deansgate'' and the hotel under ''303 Deansgate''. Widely referred to as ''Beetham Tower'', it is also known colloquially as the ''Hilton Tower'' thanks to the corporate logos placed on the 24th storey plant floor on each side of the building.{{Fact|date=February 2008}}

== Description ==
Located along [[Deansgate]] at the junction with [[Great Bridgewater Street]] and [[Liverpool Road (Manchester)|Liverpool Road]], it has 47 floors and is <span style="white-space:nowrap">168.87&nbsp;metres&nbsp;(554&nbsp;ft)</span> in height, making it the tallest building in the UK outside of London and the UK's 7th tallest building. It is the tallest building in Manchester, having overtaken the [[CIS Tower]]. In comparison, the UK's tallest building, [[One Canada Square]], is <span style="white-space:nowrap">235&nbsp;metres&nbsp;(771&nbsp;ft)</span> tall.<ref name="bbc_height" />

The tower contains a five-star 285 bedroom [[Hilton Hotel]]<ref name="skyscrapernews" /> for the first 22 floors. The 23rd floor is deeper than those below by 4m, and has two glass windows in the floor, offering views down to the ground from the skybar Cloud 23,<ref name="skyscrapernews_april06">{{cite news | url=http://www.skyscrapernews.com/news.php?ref=590 | title=Beetham Tower Manchester Celebrates Top Out | publisher=SkyScraperNews | date=[[27 April]] [[2006]] | accessdate=2008-02-23}}</ref> which is the only skybar in Manchester. The floor also has a bar and lounge, both operated by Hilton.{{Fact|date=February 2008}} From the 25th to 47th floors, the tower is occupied by residential apartments.{{Fact|date=February 2008}}

As part of the project, a 12-storey office block is due to be constructed adjacent to the tower,<ref name="skyscrapernews" /> with 6,506 square metres of floor space.<ref name="skyscrapernews_aug05">{{cite news | url=http://www.skyscrapernews.com/news.php?ref=380 | title=Beetham Reaches New Heights In Manchester | publisher=SkyScraperNews | date=[[1 August]] [[2005]] | accessdate=2008-02-23}}</ref> The hotel also has a 4-storey annex, containing a swimming pool, ballroom, conference rooms and coffee shop.<ref name="skyscrapernews_april06" />

The architect, [[Ian Simpson]], bought and resides in the top floor penthouse, which is the highest living space in [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. It cost him <U+00A3>3 million.<ref name="skyscrapernews_april06" /> It features a semi internal garden containing 21 four-metre high olive, lemon and oak trees shipped from Italy and craned into the building before the roof was built.  The penthouse covers the top two stories of the building.{{Fact|date=February 2008}}

The tower offers views of the set of ''[[Coronation Street]]'' and on a clear day, it is also possible to see [[Liverpool]], the mountains of [[Snowdonia]], [[Blackpool Tower]],<ref name="bbc_height" /> much of the Cheshire Plain and the [[Lovell Telescope]] at [[Jodrell Bank Observatory]].{{Fact|date=February 2008}}

The tower can be seen from many towns around the area including: [[Hyde, Greater Manchester|Hyde]], [[Bredbury]], [[Oldham]], [[Ashton-under-Lyne]], and many more.

== Construction ==
The site was originally occupied by an obsolete section of railway viaduct.<ref name="skyscrapernews_aug05" /> Planning permission for the development was given in October 2003, at which point 206 of the 219 apartments had already been sold, as well as 4 of the 16 penthouses.<ref name="bbc_planningpermission">{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/3218247.stm | title = Green light for high living | publisher = [[BBC News]] | date = [[27 October]] [[2003]] | accessdate = 2008-02-23}}</ref> The viaduct was demolished in March 2004, and the twin cores of the building were above ground level at the end of August 2004. One of the two cores reached a height of 125&nbsp;m at the end of July 2005, at which point the building became the tallest UK skyscraper outside of London.<ref name="skyscrapernews_aug05" />

The Beetham Hilton Tower was built entirely using post-tensioned flat slab concrete construction<ref name="mace">{{cite web | url=http://www.mace.manchester.ac.uk/undergraduate/whymace/civil/trail/xml/Features/beetham.html | title=A Guide to Civil Engineering in Manchester | accessdate=2008-03-25}}</ref> and was the first building in the UK to use the Doka SKE 100 automatic climbing system and trapezoidal windshield.<ref name="concrete">{{cite journal | url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa5379/is_200510/ai_n21381488 | journal=Concrete | month=October | year=2005 | title=Keeping Beetham Tower on target | last=Seers | first=Richard | accessdate=2008-03-26}}</ref>

The tower had its official "topping-out" ceremony on [[26 April]] [[2006]]. Due to local wind conditions, the building's height had to be reduced by just over 2 metres from its originally planned height of 171&nbsp;m (561&nbsp;ft).<ref name="bbc_height" /> The hotel opened and received its first guests on [[9 October]] [[2006]] with the first apartment residents moving in during 2007.{{Fact|date=February 2008}}

In total, the building cost <U+00A3>150 million to construct.<ref name="skyscrapernews" />

== Issues ==
During the installation of the glass and steel 'blade' architectural feature on the roof, a strange noise problem emerged. People reported that the building "whistles" (more like an intermittent hum) in windy weather. The sound is close to standard musical C (approximately 262 Hertz); some say it is like a "[[UFO]] landing" in sci-fi films. <ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.newscientisttech.com/channel/tech/mg19125631.300.html | title=Buildings that whistle in the wind | publisher=[[New Scientist]] Tech | date= [[4 August]] [[2006]]}}</ref> The noise also affected the production of local soap opera, [[Coronation Street]] with producers having to create extra background noise as the tower is close to the show's set. Despite apparently rectifying the problem, the humming sound can still be heard on occasion in the area, depending on wind direction.{{Fact|date=February 2008}}

Additionally, many residents of districts close to the city centre, including the [[Hulme]] area of Manchester, report a significant loss of television reception following construction of the tower.<ref> [http://gavinwhite.blogspot.com/2006/10/can-big-be-beautiful.html Can big be beautiful?]</ref> Effects have been reported as far away as [[Whalley Range]].{{Fact|date=February 2008}}
