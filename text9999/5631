'''Grigore Alexandru Ghica''' or '''Ghika''' (1803 or 1807 <U+2013> August 24, 1857) was a [[List of rulers of Moldavia|Prince]] of [[Moldavia]] between October 14, 1849 and June 1853, and again between October 30, 1854 and June 3, 1856. His wife was Helena, a member of the [[Sturdza family]] and daughter of [[Ioan Sturdza]], who had been Prince of Moldavia from 1822 to 1828.

==Biography==
===Early life and first rule===
Born sometime between 1800 and 1810, Grigore Alexandru was a member of the [[Ghica family]] of [[boyars]], and a descendant of [[Phanariotes]]. After being educated in [[France]] and the [[German Confederation]], he returned to his native country and rallied with the [[Romantic nationalism|nationalist]] and [[Liberalism and radicalism in Romania|liberal]] opposition to Prince [[Mihail Sturdza]] under the ''[[Regulamentul Organic]]'' regime.<ref name="biographigenghika">"Ghika, Gr<U+00E9>goire", in ''Nouvelle biographie g<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>rale depuis les temps les plus recul<U+00E9>s jusqu'<U+00E0> nos jours'', Tome 20, Firmin Didot, Paris, 1857, p.394</ref> Following the [[Moldavian revolution of 1848|1848 Revolution]] and Sturdza's deposition, despite his political choices, with [[Russian Empire|Russia]]'s approval, the [[Sfatul boieresc|Moldavian Divan]] appointed Ghica as ruler for a seven-year term<ref name="biographigenghika"/> (recognition from the [[Ottoman Empire]], the country's other overseer, was obtained through the [[Treaty of Balta Liman]]).   

Soon after receiving the throne in [[Ia<U+015F>i]], Ghica carried out a series of moderate reforms, and prepared to implement more radical ones.<ref name="biographigenghika"/> He was responsible for creating a corps of [[Gendarmerie|Gendarmes]] (April 3, 1850), which was to serve as an embryo for the present-day [[Jandarmeria Rom<U+00E2>n<U+0103>|Romanian Gendarmerie]].<ref>{{ro icon}} [http://www.jandarmeriaromana.ro/pagini/istoric.html "Repere istorice"], at the Romanian Gendarmerie site</ref> In 1851, he nominated the [[Transylvania]]n-born intellectual [[August Treboniu Laurian]], himself a noted supporter of [[Romanians|ethnic Romanian]] nationalism, as Inspector of the Schools in Moldavia.<ref>"Lauriano, Augustin-Tribonius", in ''Nouvelle biographie g<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>rale depuis les temps les plus recul<U+00E9>s jusqu'<U+00E0> nos jours'', Tome 29, Firmin Didot, Paris, 1859, p.939</ref> Additionally, his rule relaxed [[censorship]], and became noted for an increase in literary activities.<ref name="drace">Alex Drace-Francis, ''The Making of Modern Romanian Culture: Literacy and the Development of National Identity'', I. B. Tauris, London, 2006, p.160</ref>

Grigore Alexandru Ghica's program was ended by the [[Crimean War]], when Russian troops occupied the [[Danubian Principalities]] as a means to attack the Ottoman Empire.<ref name="biographigenghika"/> Deposed in June 1853, he went into exile in October, crossing into the [[Austrian Empire]] and settling in [[Vienna]].<ref name="biographigenghika"/> When occupying troops were forced to retreat the following year, and Russian influence remained marginal,<ref name="drace"/> he was allowed to regain his position, and attempted to fulfill his platform.<ref name="biographigenghika"/>

===Second rule and reforms===
{{main|Slavery in Romania}}
As such, Ghica ordered the [[Abolitionism|abolition]] of [[Roma minority in Romania|Roma]] [[Slavery in Romania|slavery]]. This came at the end of a gradual process: since slaves owned by the state and the [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Orthodox Church]] had been set free by Mihail Sturdza in 1844, the order applied to the sizable category of privately-owned Roma.<ref name="achim">Viorel Achim, ''The Roma in Romanian History'', [[Central European University Press]], Budapest, 2004, p.111-112</ref> The legislative project was drafted by [[Mihail Kog<U+0103>lniceanu]] and [[Petre Mavrogheni]], and passed with the Divan's unanimous vote on December 22, 1855,<ref name="djuvara">[[Neagu Djuvara]], ''<U+00CE>ntre Orient <U+015F>i Occident. <U+0162><U+0103>rile rom<U+00E2>ne la <U+00EE>nceputul epocii moderne'', [[Humanitas publishing house|Humanitas]], Bucharest, 1995, p.275-278, 355-356</ref> providing compensation for all adult and able Roma, part of which was to be collected from former state-owned slaves.<ref name="achim"/> In the end, as the sums owed were threatening to drain state resources, payment was settled with [[Government bond|state bonds]] (while 264 boyars agreed to free their slaves at no expense to the state).<ref name="achim"/> As many as 30,000 Roma<ref name="achim"/> or as few as 5,000<ref name="djuvara"/> gained their freedom as a direct result of the move.

The order was the direct consequence of a public scandal involving the family of [[Dimitrie Cantacuzino-Pa<U+015F>canu]], who had been Moldavia's ''[[logof<U+0103>t]]'' during the 1830s. Dimitrie's widow Profira had adopted and educated Dinc<U+0103>, a son of her husband's from an adulterous relationship with a Roma slave, who served the estate as a cook.<ref name="djuvara"/> As a result of his upbringing, Dinc<U+0103> had emancipated himself and was even allowed access to French high-society, when he accompanied Profira Cantacuzino to [[Paris]].<ref name="djuvara"/> While there, he made the acquaintance of a chambermaid, Cl<U+00E9>mentine, who became his fianc<U+00E9>e and agreed to accompany him back to Moldavia.<ref name="djuvara"/> Upon his return, Dinc<U+0103>'s status as a slave was exposed &mdash; impressed by the situation, Ghica agreed to advocate his release, but met opposition from Profira Cantacuzino, who argued that Dinc<U+0103> reminded her of her deceased husband, and stressed that she could not allow him to grow estranged.<ref name="djuvara"/> Confronted with the news and aware that he would not be allowed to marry a free woman, Dinc<U+0103> shot his wife and then himself, an event which served to draw additional support for the abolitionist cause.<ref name="djuvara"/>    

Ghica's overt approval of the nationalist program, which called for uniting Moldavia and Wallachia<ref name="biographigenghika"/> and implied measures to support ''[[Partida Na<U+0163>ional<U+0103>]]'''s activities, provoked the opposition of Austria and the Ottoman Empire.<ref name="biographigenghika"/><ref name="wmiller">William Miller, ''The Ottoman Empire and Its Successors, 1801-1927'', [[Routledge]], London, 1966, p.244</ref> During the late years of his rule, he appointed several ''Partida Na<U+0163>ional<U+0103>'' representatives to government positions.<ref name="wmiller"/> 

In 1856, Prince Grigore legislated an end to censorship and instituted [[freedom of the press]].<ref name="drace"/> A notable cultural event during the later years of his rule was a debate over the authenticity of the ''[[Chronicle of Huru]]'', a document which claimed to shed light on obscure events in Moldavian history, and which received ideological support from the anti-unionist [[Gheorghe Asachi]].<ref name="boia">[[Lucian Boia]], ''History and Myth in Romanian Consciousness'', Central European University Press, Budapest, 2001, p.47-49</ref> Ghica appointed a Commission of experts, comprising Laurian, Kog<U+0103>lniceanu, and [[Costache Negruzzi]], which reported that the document was a forgery.<ref>{{ro icon}} [[Gheorghe Adamescu]], [http://biblioteca.euroweb.ro/adamescu.htm ''Istoria literaturii rom<U+00E2>ne. Literatura istoric<U+0103>'']</ref><ref name="boia"/>

===Later years and suicide===
After his term expired, Ghica left the country and moved to Paris.<ref name="biographigenghika"/><ref name="djuvara"/> In his place, after a short hiatus, the [[Ottoman Porte|Porte]] appointed a [[Teodor Bal<U+015F>]], with the title of ''[[Caimacam]]''.<ref name="wmiller"/> A noted adversary of the unionist cause, Bal<U+015F> focused his attention on becoming titular Prince.<ref name="wmiller"/> Having retreated to his property in [[Le M<U+00E9>e-sur-Seine]], the former ruler continued to advocate the union, which had by then been made more probable by the [[Treaty of Paris (1856)|1856 Treaty of Paris]], and, to this end, attempted to determine the [[Second French Empire]] to issue formal approval for free and transparent elections to be carried out in Moldavia &mdash; annulling the electoral fraud carried out by [[Nicolae Vogoride]] (who had since replaced Bal<U+015F>).<ref name="djuvara"/> This brought him to the attention of anti-unionists, who began publicizing various inflammatory allegations in reference to Ghica.<ref name="djuvara"/> Feeling insulted by the arguments, Ghica also grew disenchanted by [[List of French monarchs|Emperor]] [[Napoleon III of France|Napoleon III]]'s refusal to grant him an audience (despite the fact that, by then, the French monarch had chosen to endorse new Moldavian elections).<ref name="djuvara"/>

He committed suicide in his home.<ref name="djuvara"/> Shortly before this, he drafted his last will, which was introduced by the statement:
<blockquote>"I am the victim of a foul deed and cannot live any longer, although I know myself to be completely innocent. The day shall come when truth will be exposed. I await my enemies in front of [[Last Judgment|God's court]]."<ref name="djuvara"/></blockquote>

==Legacy==
Just two days after his death, Ottoman authorities agreed to overturn the elections sanctioned by Vogoride.<ref name="djuvara"/> When the Moldo-Wallachian union was effected by the 1859 double election of [[Alexandru Ioan Cuza]], who reigned as ''[[Domnitor]]'', Ghica's law on censorship served as a model for new legislation, and was generalized throughout [[Romania]].<ref name="drace"/> In recognition of his role in creating the [[Jandarmeria Rom<U+00E2>n<U+0103>|Gendarmerie]], the School for Subordinate Officers in [[Dr<U+0103>g<U+0103><U+015F>ani]] (originally located in [[Bumbe<U+015F>ti-Jiu]]) was named after him.<ref>{{ro icon}} [http://www.scoaladragasani.ro/index.php ''<U+015E>coala Militar<U+0103> de Subofi<U+0163>eri Jandarmi Dr<U+0103>g<U+0103><U+015F>ani'' (official site)]</ref>

A section [[Ion Creang<U+0103>]]'s book ''Amintiri din copil<U+0103>rie'', which details the Prince's visit to the school in [[T<U+00E2>rgu Neam<U+0163>]] at a time when Creang<U+0103> was a student there, contains an admiring portrait of Ghica ("handsome in features and gentle"), as well as a section of his speech on the occasion.<ref>{{ro icon}} [[Ion Creang<U+0103>]], [http://ro.wikisource.org/wiki/Amintiri_din_copil%C4%83rie ''Amintiri din copil<U+0103>rie''] (wikisource)</ref>

Grigore Alexandru Ghica was the grandfather of [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] Archbishop [[Vladimir Ghika]], who was a victim of the [[Communist Romania|Romanian Communist regime]].<ref name="djuvara"/>
