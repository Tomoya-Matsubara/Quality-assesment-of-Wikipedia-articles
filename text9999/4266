'''Jean-Baptiste Rich<U+00E9>''' (1780 &ndash; February 27, 1847) was a career officer and general in the Ha<U+00EF>tian Army. He was made President of [[Ha<U+00EF>ti]] on March 1, 1846.

Rich<U+00E9> was born free, the son of a prominent free black man of the same name in the North Province of [[Saint-Domingue]] (the French colony that later became Ha<U+00EF>ti).  His father was a sergeant in the colonial militia and probably served in the rebel forces.  Rich<U+00E9> himself joined the [[Ha<U+00EF>tian Revolution]]aries probably some time in 1801. After Ha<U+00EF>ti gained independence at the end of the revolution in 1803, Rich<U+00E9> joined the forces of [[Henri Christophe]], who in 1807 promoted him to the rank of general and deputy commander of his army. During the civil war that followed between [[Alexandre P<U+00E9>tion]] and Christophe, Rich<U+00E9> was instrumental in Christophe's victory at the [[Battle of Siebert]] on January 1, 1807. During the siege of [[Port-au-Prince]] in 1811, Rich<U+00E9> commanded the left wing of Christophe's army. A loyal officer, Rich<U+00E9> quickly became one of Christophe's most trusted commanders, and as a consequence he was placed in command of Ha<U+00EF>ti's Northern Province, where he was effective in subduing the [[mulatto]] population.

After Christophe's downfall in 1820, Rich<U+00E9> supported the new government and was therefore able to retain his post during the subsequent administration of [[Jean Pierre Boyer]], and those that followed. This continued until [[Jean-Louis Pierrot]] became [[President of Ha<U+00EF>ti]] in 1845. Pierrot attempted to reform the Ha<U+00EF>tian government, causing the Boyerist hierarchy of Ha<U+00EF>ti to sponsor a rebellion in the provinces of Port-au-Prince and [[Artibonite Department|Artibonite]] in 1846. The rebel army under mulatto control proclaimed Rich<U+00E9> president of Ha<U+00EF>ti on March 1, 1846. After much of the Ha<U+00EF>tian army sided with the rebels, President Pierrot relinquished his office on March 24, 1846. After gaining the presidency of Ha<U+00EF>ti, one of Rich<U+00E9>'s first acts was to restore the [[Constitution]] of 1816.

As president, Rich<U+00E9> was considered a failure by his Boyerist backers. Originally intended to be a figurehead, Rich<U+00E9> quickly began to take an active role. He soon proposed reforms similar to those espoused by former President Pierrot. Probably as a result of these proposals he died on February 27, 1847, possibly from being poisoned, although this has never been established. Rich<U+00E9>'s presidency, considered ineffective by historians, opened the way for considerable changes in the political landscape of Ha<U+00EF>ti during the succeeding administrations. As a result, his presidency can be considered a turning point in the history of Ha<U+00EF>tian politics.

After Rich<U+00E9>'s death in 1847, he was replaced by Faustin-<U+00C9>lie Soulouque, who was anticipated to be similar to Rich<U+00E9>. Soulouque later appointed himself Emperor [[Faustin I]].
