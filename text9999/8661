'''Texas Tech University''' is a [[public university|public]], coeducational, research university in [[Lubbock, Texas]]. Established on February 10, 1923, and originally known as Texas Technological College, it is the leading institution of the [[Texas Tech University System]] and has the [[List of largest Texas universities by enrollment|sixth largest]] student body in the state of Texas. With {{convert|1839|acre|km2}}, it has the second largest contiguous campus in the United States and is the only school in Texas to house an undergraduate institution, [[law school]], and [[medical school]] at the same location. 

The university offers degrees in more than 150 courses of study through 12 colleges and hosts 60 research centers and institutes. Texas Tech University has awarded over 200,000 degrees since 1927, including over 40,000 graduate and professional degrees. The [[The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching|Carnegie Foundation]] classifies Texas Tech as having "high research activity." Research projects in the areas of [[epidemiology]], [[pulsed power]], [[grid computing]], [[nanophotonics]], and [[wind energy]] are among the most prominent at the university.

The [[Architecture of the Spanish Renaissance|Spanish Renaissance]] themed campus, described by author [[James Michener]] as "the most beautiful west of the Mississippi until you get to [[Stanford University|Stanford]]", has been awarded the Green Star Award for excellence in grounds-keeping, and has been noted for possessing a public art collection among the ten best in the United States.  

The [[Texas Tech Red Raiders]] are members of the [[Big 12 Conference]] (South Division) and compete in [[Division I]] for all varsity sports. The [[Texas Tech Red Raiders football|Red Raiders football team]] has made 31 bowl appearances, which is [[List of schools by Bowl appearances|19th most]] of any university. The men's basketball team has made 14 appearances in the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Division I Tournament]]. [[Bob Knight]], the winningest coach in men's [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] D-1 basketball history, served as the team's head coach from 2001 to 2008. The Lady Raiders women's basketball team won the [[1993 NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Tournament|1993]] [[NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Championship|women's national championship]]. In 1999, Texas Tech's [[Goin' Band from Raiderland]] received the [[Sudler Trophy]], which is awarded to "recognize collegiate marching bands of particular excellence."

Though the majority of the university's students originate in the southwestern United States, the school has served students from all 50 states and more than 100 foreign countries.  Texas Tech University alumni and former students have gone on to prominent careers in government, business, science, medicine, education, sports, and entertainment.

[[Image:Texas Tech Adminstration Building 1923.jpg|left|thumb|Administration Building (c. 1925)]]
The call to open a college in [[West Texas]] began shortly after the arrival of settlers in the area in the 1880s.<ref>{{cite news|last=Hensley|first=Doug|title=Landing Tech may have been biggest step in Lubbock's first 100 years|work=[[Lubbock Avalanche-Journal]]|date=[[2008-08-03]]|url=http://lubbockonline.com/stories/080308/loc_312967413.shtml|accessdate=2008-08-04}}</ref><ref name=Hub>{{cite web|title=A History of Legendary Lubbock: The Hub City of West Texas|publisher=Lubbock Chamber of Commerce|pages=9|url=http://www.lubbockchamber.com/documents/AHistoryofLegendaryLubbock.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2008-08-08}}</ref> In 1917, the Texas legislature passed a bill creating a branch of [[Texas A&M University|Texas A&M]] to be located in [[Abilene, Texas|Abilene]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Mares|first=Lluvia|title=Abilene home to three distinguished colleges|work=[[Abilene Reporter-News]]|date=[[2006-01-27]]|url=http://www.reporternews.com/news/2006/Jan/27/abilene-home-to-three-distinguished-colleges/|accessdate=2008-08-06}}</ref> However, the bill was repealed two years later during the next session after it was discovered that [[James E. Ferguson|Governor James E. Ferguson]] had falsely reported the site committee's choice of location. After new legislation passed votes in the state house and senate in 1921, [[Pat Morris Neff|Governor Pat Neff]] vetoed it, citing hard financial times in West Texas.  Furious about Neff's veto, some in West Texas went so far as to recommend that West Texas secede from the state.<ref name=Grad>{{cite web|title=Tech History|publisher=Texas Tech University|url=http://grad.ba.ttu.edu/GSC_Tech_Lubbock/GSC_Tech_and_Lubbock_History.asp|accessdate=2008-08-06}}</ref>

In 1923, the legislature decided that, rather than a branch campus, an entirely new university system would better serve the needs of the region.<ref name=Handbook>{{cite web|title=Handbook of Texas Online: Texas Tech University|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/TT/kct32.html|accessdate=2008-03-28}}</ref>  On February 10, 1923, Neff signed the legislation creating Texas Technological College, and in July of that year a committee began searching for a site.<ref name=Grad /> When the members of the committee visited Lubbock, they were overwhelmed to find residents lining the streets to show support for the idea of hosting the institution.<ref name=KCBD>{{cite news|title=Texas Tech a Major Part of Hub City History|publisher=[[KCBD]]|date=[[2008-07-02]]|url=http://www.kcbd.com/Global/story.asp?S=8613752|accessdate=2008-07-31}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Reynolds|first=John|title=Three universities power higher education in Lubbock|work=[[Lubbock Avalanche-Journal]]|url=http://www.lubbockonline.com/stories/060505/lif_850412.shtml|accessdate=2008-08-06}}</ref> That August, Lubbock was chosen on the first ballot over other area towns, including [[Floydada, Texas|Floydada]], [[Plainview, Texas|Plainview]], and [[Sweetwater, Texas|Sweetwater]].<ref name=KCBD />

Texas Tech grew slowly in the early years.  Military training was conducted at the college as early as 1925, but formal [[ROTC]] training did not commence until 1936.

Though enrollment declined during [[World War II]], Texas Tech trained 4,747 men in its [[armed forces]] training detachments.<ref name=Handbook /> Following the war, in 1946, the college saw its enrollment leap to 5,366 from a low of 1,696 in 1943.<ref>{{cite web|title=Raw Enrollment Data|publisher=Texas Tech University|url=http://www.irs.ttu.edu/ARCHIVE/ENR/FALLENRL.HTM|accessdate=2008-08-22}}</ref>

The university was [[Racial integration|integrated]] for in 1961 when three [[African American|African-American]] students were admitted. After its initial rejection of the students' enrollment and the threat of a subsequent lawsuit, the university enacted a policy to admit "all qualified applicants regardless of color".<ref>{{cite book|last=Shabazz|first=Amilcar|title=Advancing Democracy: African Americans and the Struggle for Access and Equity in Higher Education in Texas|publisher=[[University of North Carolina Press]]|year=2004|location=[[Greensboro, NC]]|pages=205|isbn=9780807855058}}</ref> In 1967, the face of the Red Raiders football team was forever changed when the university offered its first athletic scholarship to a black student, Danny Hardaway.<ref>{{cite web|last=Scott|first=Sam|title=Hardaway relates Tech experience|work=[[Lubbock Avalanche-Journal]]|date=[[1999-02-07]]|url=http://www.lubbockonline.com/stories/020799/0207990053.shtml|accessdate=2008-08-27}}</ref> Texas Tech reached another milestone in 1970 when Hortense W.

During the same time period<U+2014>the 1960s and 1970s<U+2014>the university invested [[United States dollar|US$]]150 million in the campus to construct buildings for the library, foreign languages, social sciences, communications, philosophy, electrical and petroleum engineering, art, and architecture.

Even though growth continued at Texas Tech, the university was not immune to controversy.

=== Mascots ===
[[Image:Raiderred.png|thumb|Raider Red cartoon by Dirk West]]
[[The Masked Rider]] is Texas Tech University's oldest mascot.  The tradition began in 1936, when "ghost riders" were dared to circle the field Starting at the beginning of home football games. The Masked Rider became an official mascot in 1954, when Joe Kirk Fulton led the team onto the field at the [[Gator Bowl]]. According to reports from those present at the game, the crowd sat in stunned silence as they watched Fulton and his horse Blackie rush onto the football field, followed by the team. After a few moments, the silent crowd burst into cheers. Ed Danforth, a writer for the ''[[Atlanta Journal]]'' who witnessed the event, later wrote, "No team in any bowl game ever made a more sensational entrance."<ref>{{cite news|last=Smits|first=Garry|title=Mascots unmasked: A lasting tradition for Texas Tech began at 1954 Gator Bowl|work=[[The Florida Times-Union]]|date=[[2007-12-26]]|url=http://www.jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/122507/col_228878061.shtml|accessdate=2006-04-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Ritz|first=Jennifer|title=History of Masked Rider: A history of one of Texas Tech's Oldest and Best-Loved Traditions|work=Texas Techsan Magazine|url=http://www.depts.ttu.edu/spiritsquads/MR_History.htm|accessdate=2008-08-12}}</ref>

Today the Masked Rider, with [[guns up]], leads the team onto the field for all home games. This mascot, adorned in a distinctive [[gaucho]] hat like the ones worn by members of the marching band, is one of the most visible figures at Texas Tech. Ashley Hartzog, a senior animal science and Spanish major from [[Farwell, Texas]], will represent the university as the Masked Rider during 2008/09.<ref>{{cite news|last=Griffin|first=Tim|title=After passing series of tests, Hartzog to serve as Tech's Masked Rider|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=[[2008-06-26]]|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=3460419|accessdate=2008-08-12}}</ref>

[[Image:MRlogo.png|left|thumb|The Masked Rider logo]]
Texas Tech's other mascot, [[Raider Red]], is a more recent creation. Beginning with the 1971 football season, the Southwest Conference forbade the inclusion of live animal mascots to away games unless the host school consented. For situations where the host school did not want to allow the Masked Rider's horse, an alternate mascot was needed. Jim Gaspard, a member of the [[Saddle Tramps]] student spirit organization, created the original design for the Raider Red costume, basing it on a character created by cartoonist [[Dirk West]], a Texas Tech alumnus and former Lubbock mayor.<ref>{{cite news|last=Gulick|first=Joe|title=Dirk West: Before the mustache, guns|work=[[Lubbock Avalanche-Journal]]|date=[[2008-05-04]]|url=http://www.lubbockonline.com/stories/050408/loc_275256359.shtml|accessdate=2008-08-14}}</ref> Though the Masked Rider's identity is public knowledge, it has always been tradition that Raider Red's student alter ego is kept secret until the end of his or her tenure.<ref>{{cite web|title=Raider Red|publisher=Texas Tech University|url=http://www.ttu.edu/traditions/raiderred.php|accessdate=2008-08-30}}</ref> The student serving as Raider Red is a member of the Saddle Tramps or [[High Riders]].

== Traditions ==
=== Double T spirit logo ===
[[Image:Texas-Tech-University-logo.png|thumb|Double T spirit logo]]
The most readily identified symbol of Texas Tech is the Double T logo. The logo, generally attributed to Texas Tech's first football coach, [[E. Y. Freeland]], was first used as decoration on the sweaters for the football players.<ref>{{cite web|title=Double T Symbol|publisher=Texas Tech University|url=http://www.ttu.edu/traditions/doublet.php|accessdate=2008-08-19}}</ref> The Double T existed in its original form as an official logo from 1963 to 1999 and was updated in 2000. The new logo maintains the original premise but incorporates three-dimensional bevelling effects coupled with white trim. 

To recognize the importance of the Double T to Texas Tech, the class of 1931 donated the Double T bench.  Per tradition, freshmen are not allowed to sit on the bench, which is currently located in the courtyard of the Administration Building. The logo is further embodied in the Double T [[neon sign]], donated by the class of 1938 and affixed to the east side of Jones AT&T Stadium. At the time of its purchase, this was reputedly the largest neon sign in existence.<ref name=Parent>{{cite web|title=A Review of Tech Traditions|publisher=Texas Tech University|url=http://www.depts.ttu.edu/studentaffairs/parent2002/information/traditions.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2008-08-13}}</ref>

=== Texas Tech ring ===
[[Image:Techring.png|thumb|right|Texas Tech alumni ring]]
While the [[class ring]] had occasionally used a universal design, by the late 20th century various styles were available.  In 1999, the university reverted to a single ring design for the university's graduates.  The new Official Texas Tech Alumni Association Class Ring symbolically captures the essence of Texas Tech with the prominent Double T logo surrounded by the school<U+2019>s full name and date of foundation.  By tradition, undergraduates wear the ring with the Double T logo facing themselves.   Upon graduation, the ring is turned so the logo faces outward.

One shoulder of the ring displays an image of the Administration Building, with the bells which represent victory. The other shoulder contains the university seal: an American eagle perched above a book, representing the church; a star, representing the State of Texas; a key, representing home; and, a lamp, representing knowledge. These elements are separated by a cross featuring ten cotton bolls, one each for Lubbock and its nine surrounding cotton-producing counties.<ref>{{cite web|title=TTAA Class Ring & Ceremony|publisher=Texas Tech University|url=http://www.ttu.edu/traditions/ring.php|accessdate=2008-08-14}}</ref>

=== Will Rogers and Soapsuds ===
One of the most well-known landmarks on campus is the statue of [[Will Rogers]] on his horse Soapsuds. The statue has resided at the center of the campus since it was dedicated on February 16, 1950 by Rogers' longtime friend [[Amon G. Carter]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Hooks|first=Michael Q.|title=Will and Soapsuds|publisher=Southwest Collection|url=http://swco.ttu.edu/University_Archive/pdf/1982.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2008-08-18}}</ref> Carter claimed that Texas Tech was the ideal setting for the statue and that it would be an appropriate addition to the traditions and scenery of [[West Texas]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Will Rogers statue dedicated|publisher=Lubbock Centennial|url=http://lubbockcentennial.com/Section/1934_1958/WillRogers.shtml|accessdate=2008-08-14}}</ref>  The statue, estimated to cost (in 1950) $25,000, stands 9&nbsp;feet 11&nbsp;inches (3&nbsp;m) and weighs 3,200&nbsp;[[pound (mass)|pounds]] (1,450&nbsp;kg).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://media.www.dailytoreador.com/media/storage/paper870/news/2006/08/25/LaVida/How-To.Live.As.A.Raider.In.12.Big.Ways-2250711.shtml|title=How to Live as a Raider in 12 Big Ways|accessdate=2008-08-18|work=[[The Daily Toreador]]|last=Monahan|first=Stephen}}</ref> The inscription on the plaque at the base of the statue reads: "Lovable Old Will Rogers on his favorite horse, 'Soapsuds', riding into the Western sunset."<ref name=Rogers>{{cite web|title=Will Rogers & Soapsuds|publisher=Texas Tech University|url=http://www.ttu.edu/traditions/rogers.php|accessdate=2008-08-14}}</ref>  

[[Image:Wrstatue.jpg|thumb|left|Will Rogers and Soapsuds]]
According to one legend, the statue was originally to be positioned with Will Rogers facing due west, so that it would appear he was riding into the sunset.  However, that position would cause Soapsuds' posterior to face due east, towards the main entrance of the school.  The horse's rear would also be facing downtown Lubbock, potentially insulting the Lubbock business community. To solve this problem, the statue was turned 23&nbsp;[[degree (angle)|degrees]] to the northwest so Soapsuds' rear would face southeast in the general direction of [[College Station, Texas]], home of rival Texas A&M University. Before every home football game, the Saddle Tramps wrap the statue with red crepe paper. In times of national tragedies, the statue has also been wrapped in black crepe paper.<ref name=Rogers/>
