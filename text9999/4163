==Biography==
===Early life===
Anthony Erwin Randolph, Jr. was born to Anthony and Crystal Randolph in [[Wurzbach]], [[Germany]], where both of his parents served in the [[military]].<ref name="ARNBABio"></ref> Randolph spent the first year of his life in Germany before his family moved to [[Pasadena, California]], where he spent the majority of his childhood.<ref name="ARNBABio"></ref> Randolph attended schools in Pasadena as well as [[Little Rock, Arkansas]] before heading to [[Woodrow Wilson High School (Dallas, Texas)|Woodrow Wilson High School]] in [[Dallas]], [[Texas]] for his junior year.<ref name="ARNewsFellow">{{cite web|last=|first=|url=http://www.newsfollow.com/the-raw-feed/anthony-randolph|title=Anthony Randolph Pictures, News and Video&nbsp;<U+2014> NewsFollow|format=|work=|publisher=''NewsFollow.com''|accessdate=2009-07-13}}</ref> Randolph's mother decided the school he was attending in [[Arkansas]] was not right for him because of the differences he had with the coach and in school.<ref name="WWPatWashingtonIntrvw">{{cite news|title=Warriorsworld&nbsp;<U+2014> Interview with Pat Washington&nbsp;<U+2014> Anthony Randolph's High School Coach|last=|first=Rasheed|publisher=''WarriorsWorld.net''|date=2009-06-29|url=http://www.warriorsworld.net/news/latest/interview-with-pat-washington---anthony-randolphs-high-school-coach.html|accessdate=2009-07-13}}</ref> At the time he was a virtually unknown player.<ref name="WWPatWashingtonIntrvw"></ref> Pat Washington, Randolph's high school coach, stated that while Randolph was athletically gifted he needed a lot of work on skills such as ball handling, shooting, etc.<ref name="WWPatWashingtonIntrvw"></ref> Washington also spoke of a technique the team had in workouts called the "LAB," where the basic rules were that all players in play were required to never stop running under any circumstances, and if the ball was turned over at any point the player was to run back on defense immediately.<ref name="WWPatWashingtonIntrvw"></ref> The technique might have contributed to Randolph's later defensive prowess, as he has been known to hustle back after [[Turnover (basketball)|turnovers]] for defensive stops in his professional career. In high school, Randolph played all five positions on the floor.<ref name="WWPatWashingtonIntrvw"></ref> During his senior season, Randolph's team did not qualify for a playoff position, which coach Washington attributed to bad chemistry.<ref name="WWPatWashingtonIntrvw"></ref> Washington called the team very talented and referred to Randolph as the best player on the roster but stated that "as time went by jealousy and agendas set in and took over."<ref name="WWPatWashingtonIntrvw"></ref> Playing under coach Pat Washington, Randolph averaged 25.8 points and 12.6 rebounds as a senior.<ref name="ARNewsFellow"></ref> Although Randolph was named to the first team All-Area Dallas Morning News boys basketball team, played in the [[Reebok]] Round Ball Classic in [[Chicago]] and the [[Adidas]] Derby Festival Classic in [[Kentucky]] (leading all scorers in both games), he was not chosen to play in the [[McDonald's All-American Game]] his senior year.<ref name="ARNewsFellow"></ref><ref name="WWPatWashingtonIntrvw"></ref>

===College===
[[Glen Davis (basketball)|Glen "Big Baby" Davis]] had just left [[Louisiana State University|Lousiana State University's]] (LSU) [[LSU Tigers basketball|basketball team]] as well as seven-foot center Magnum Rolle, who mysteriously transferred to [[Louisiana Tech University|Louisiana Tech]], leaving the team with only two bigs, one being a [[junior college]] transfer.<ref name="WWPatWashingtonIntrvw"></ref> Due to this fact, LSU told Randolph that if he joined their team, he could possibly play right away as a freshman.<ref name="WWPatWashingtonIntrvw"></ref> Washington said that [[Baylor Bears men's basketball|Baylor]], [[Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball|Georgetown]], [[Kansas State Wildcats men's basketball|Kansas]], [[Memphis Tigers basketball|Memphis]], and [[Texas Longhorns men's basketball|Texas]] were also interested in recruiting Randolph.<ref name="WWPatWashingtonIntrvw"></ref> Though Memphis was Randolph's early choice in the recruitment process, he wanted to attend a school where he could play big minutes, which he figured he probably would not get to do at Memphis since the team's roster was so deep at the time.<ref name="WWPatWashingtonIntrvw"></ref> Randolph made an impact in college right away, as he had six blocks in just his third game during his freshman season.<ref name="ARNewsFellow"></ref> During his lone season at LSU, Randolph earned Honorable Mention All-SEC and First Team All-Freshman Team honors.<ref name="Warriors2008NBADraft">{{cite web|last=|first=|url=http://www.nba.com/warriors/news/Warriors_2008_Draft_Release.html|title=WARRIORS: Warriors Add Anthony Randolph And Richard Hendrix In 2008 NBA Draft|format=|work=|publisher=''NBA.com''|accessdate=2009-07-13}}</ref> Randolph was the only LSU Tiger to start all thirty-one games in his freshman season, and averaged 15.6 [[Point (basketball)|points]], 8.5 [[Rebound (basketball)|rebounds]], 1.2 assists, 1.13 steals, and 2.26 [[Block (basketball)|blocks]] per contest.<ref name="ARNewsFellow"></ref><ref name="Warriors2008NBADraft"></ref> Although the team only ended the season with a 13-18 record, Randolph finished strong by averaging 20.1 points during the last nine games of the year.<ref name="ARNewsFellow"></ref> Randolph also ranked third in the [[Southeastern Conference]] in rebounding and blocked shots, twelfth in scoring, and posted nine [[Double (basketball)#Double-double|double-doubles]] his freshman season.<ref name="Warriors2008NBADraft"></ref>

===Pro career===
Knowing there was a good chance he would be chosen in the first round, Randolph declared himself eligible for the [[2008 NBA Draft]] at the end of his freshman year at LSU.<ref>{{cite web|last=|first=|url=http://www.cbssports.com/collegebasketball/story/10767874|title=LSU's Randolph declares himself eligible for NBA Draft&nbsp;<U+2014> NCAA Division I Mens Basketball&nbsp;<U+2014> CBSS|format=|work=|publisher=''[[CBSSports.com]]''|accessdate=2009-07-15}}</ref> Some projected Randolph to go high in the year's draft because of his versatility and potential, while his detractors thought he might drop because of his thin frame and believed his overall game to still be somewhat raw.<ref name="NBADraftnet">{{cite web|last=|first=|url=http://www.nbadraft.net/players/anthony-randolph|title=Anthony Randolph&nbsp;<U+2014> NBADraft.net|format=|work=|publisher=''NBADraft.net''|accessdate=2009-07-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Chad Ford's Mock Draft, Version 6.0: Picks 1-30 - NBA&nbsp;<U+2014> ESPN|last=Ford|first=Chad|publisher=''ESPN.com''|date=2008-06-23|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/draft2008/columns/story?columnist=ford_chad&page=MockDraft-080623|accessdate=2009-07-15}}</ref> In either case, many believed Randolph could be the steal of the draft with his talent and tremendous potential.<ref>{{cite web|last=|first=|url=http://www.hoopsaddict.com/2008/06/10/an-inside-look-at-anthony-randolph|title=Hoops Addict >> An Inside Look At Anthony Randolph|format=|work=|publisher=''HoopsAddict.com''|accessdate=2009-07-15}}</ref> In the draft, the [[Golden State Warriors]] selected Randolph with the fourteenth overall pick.<ref name="Warriors2008NBADraft"></ref> The Warriors were coming off a disappointing [[2007-08 NBA season|2007-08 season]] where the team was unable to qualify for the [[NBA Playoffs|playoffs]] despite finishing the year with a 48-34 win-loss record.<ref>{{cite web|last=|first=|url=http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/GSW/2008.html|title=2007-08 Golden State Warriors Roster and Statistics&nbsp;<U+2014> Basketball-Reference.com|format=|work=|publisher=''Basketball-Reference.com''|accessdate=2009-07-13}}</ref> Early in his rookie season, Randolph received a minimal amount of playing time, causing some to question his attitude and work ethic, or if a possible rift might be developing between head coach [[Don Nelson]] and he.<ref>{{cite news|title=SFGate : Randolph hopes to work his way out of doghouse|last=Hu|first=Janny|publisher=''[[San Francisco Chronicle|SFGate.com]]''|date=2009-01-04|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/01/03/SPKT15384J.DTL|accessdate=2009-07-15}}</ref> Many of the Warriors' main rotation players suffered injuries throughout Randolph's rookie campaign, and the team ended the season with only a 29-53 record.<ref name="GSW0809SsnRvw">{{cite web|last=|first=|url=http://www.nba.com/warriors/news/200809_season_in_review.html|title=WARRIORS: 2008-09 Season In Review|format=|work=|publisher=''NBA.com''|accessdate=2009-07-18}}</ref> Nonetheless, the Warriors did play a fairly strong second half of the season, including Randolph, who averaged 13.5 points, 10.5 rebounds, 1.6 blocks, and 1.4 steals over the last twelve games of the year.<ref name="GSW0809SsnRvw"></ref>

After attending a [[Dallas Mavericks]]-[[San Antonio Spurs]] playoff game during the Warriors' offseason, Randolph became motivated to improve his play, hitting the gym hard to prepare for the following season.<ref>{{cite news|title=Randolph bigger, vows to be better&nbsp;<U+2014> ContraCostaTimes.com|last=Thompson II|first=Marcus|publisher=''[[Contra Costa Times|ContraCostaTimes.com]]''|date=2009-06-15|url=http://www.contracostatimes.com/ci_12596651?source=rss&nclick_check=1|accessdate=2009-07-15}}</ref> Randolph's efforts first began to reward him in that year's [[NBA Summer League|Summer League]] being held in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]] where he not only began to dominate consistently but was also referred to by various sportswriters as being the best talent in the entire Summer League.<ref>{{cite news|title=Saturday Summer League Roundup&nbsp;<U+2014> TrueHoop By Henry Abbott&nbsp;<U+2014> ESPN|last=Arnovitz|first=Kevin|publisher=''[[ESPN.com]]''|date=2009-07-12|url=http://myespn.go.com/blogs/truehoop/0-42-60/Saturday-Summer-League-Roundup.html|accessdate=2009-07-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Kawakami|first=Tim|url=http://blogs.mercurynews.com/kawakami/2009/07/15/randolphs-42-its-just-summer-league-but-yes-hes-a-major-warriors-centerpiece|title=Randolph's 42: It's just Summer League, but yes, he's a major Warriors centerpiece : Talking Points|format=|work=|publisher=''[[San Jose Mercury News]]''|accessdate=2009-07-18}}</ref>
