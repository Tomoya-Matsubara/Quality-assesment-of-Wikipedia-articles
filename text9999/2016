'''Zach Gowen''' (born March 30, 1983) is an American [[Professional wrestling|professional wrestler]]. Gowen has competed for [[World Wrestling Entertainment]] (WWE) on their [[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown!]] [[WWE Brand Extension|brand]], as well as [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] (TNA).

Gowen was diagnosed with [[cancer]] in 1991, and as a result, lost his left leg due to [[amputation]] at the age of 8. Gowen walks with a prosthesis and claims he can wrestle with or without it. However, he wrestles most of his matches without it due to the inherent marketability of seeing a one-legged wrestler compete. He is known for his high-flying ability as well as his "one-legged" [[moonsault]] and is known for his one legged leg drop.

==Professional wrestling career==
===Training===
In 2002, Zach Gowen was trained by Truth Martini and Brian "''The Playboy''" Shotwell in Livonia, Michigan. The training school was named House of Truth by Student Tom Balish. Popular workers that trained and worked out there include [[Chris Sabin]], [[Alex Shelley]], [[Jimmy Jacobs]] and many other popular Midwest indy wrestlers.

===Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2003, 2005, 2006)===
Gowen first gained national exposure wrestling for [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] during early 2003 under the name Tenacious Z, but soon left TNA, after signing a developmental contract for World Wrestling Entertainment.

Gowen later returned to TNA on May 15, 2005 at their [[TNA Hard Justice#2005|Hard Justice]] pay-per-view event, as the second entrant in the 20-Man [[Professional wrestling match types#Gauntlet for the Gold|Gauntlet for the Gold]] match. He lasted just under five minutes in the ring before being eliminated by [[Shark Boy]]. The next month, Gowen wrestled at the [[Slammiversary (2005)|Slammiversary]] pay-per-view, losing in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic non-elimination matches|six way match]]. He also appeared on ''[[TNA Impact!]]'', wrestling [[Michael Altieri|Mikey Batts]] to a no contest before leaving the promotion once again later that year. In October 2006, at [[Bound for Glory (2006)|Bound For Glory]], Gowen returned to TNA during the [[Kevin Nash]] [[X-Division]] Open Battle Royal Gauntlet match as the sixth entrant, but was eliminated by [[Johnny Devine]].

===World Wrestling Entertainment (2003-2004)===
He made his [[World Wrestling Entertainment]] debut on the May 15, 2003 edition of ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown!]]'' as a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Plant|planted]] fan in the audience. As [[Hulk Hogan#Mr. America (2003)|Mr. America]] (a masked Hulk Hogan) was making his way to the ring, he acknowledged Gowen personally as a loyal fan near the walkway, giving him the American flag he was carrying. Later, when Mr. America was being unfairly beaten by [[Roddy Piper]] and [[Sean O'Haire]], Gowen jumped the wall dividing the fans from the wrestler's walkway and entered the ring to aid him. Gowen shielded Mr. America's body with his own. His legless condition was then revealed when Roddy Piper grabbed Gowen and in an attempt to drag him away from Mr. America, pulled Gowen's prosthetic leg completely off and into his own hands. Fans thought the stunt was legitimate until an additional segment saw Piper be "punished" by being added to the forth-coming pay-per-view. This began a short collaboration of Gowen and Mr. America, and a [[Feud (professional wrestling)|feud]] pitting the two against Roddy Piper and Sean O'Haire. This storyline culminated at [[Judgment Day (2003)|WWE Judgement Day (2003)]] where Mr. America with Zach Gowen in his corner defeated Roddy Piper with Sean O'Haire in his corner. Gowen's partnership with Mr. America put him on bad terms with [[Vince McMahon#Mr. McMahon|Mr. McMahon]], as McMahon was convinced Mr. America was Hulk Hogan in disguise.

On the June 26 edition of ''SmackDown!'', McMahon told Gowen that if he would join his "[[Vince McMahon#Kiss My Ass Club|Kiss My Ass Club]]", he would be awarded a WWE contract. Instead Gowen hit McMahon with a low-blow.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/smackdown/030626.html|title=SmackDown! results - June 26, 2003|accessdate=2008-01-16|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref> As a result on July 3, 2003 to win his WWE contract, Gowen, along with supporter [[Stephanie McMahon]], faced off against the [[Paul Wight|Big Show]] in what Mr. McMahon billed as the first "''real''" [[Professional wrestling match types#Handicap match|handicap match]] (referring to Gowen and his [[amputee]] status in addition to the two vs. one parameters of the match).  With [[List of professional wrestling terms#R|run-in]] help from [[Kurt Angle]] and then [[Brock Lesnar]], the team of Gowen and McMahon were able to defeat the Big Show and thus won Gowen a WWE contract as per the stipulations of the match.

Gowen's win further fueled the ill-feelings toward him from Mr. McMahon. This [[Feud (professional wrestling)|feud]] culminated in a one-on-one match between the two at [[Vengeance (2003)]] in which McMahon defeated Gowen.

As a result of his feud with McMahon, Gowen was then forced into a match with former [[WWE Championship|WWE Champion]] [[Brock Lesnar]], who was in the process of being [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Put over|put over]] with a recent [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Turn|turn]]. In his hometown of [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]], Gowen won his match via disqualification when Lesnar attacked him with a steel chair. After the match, the assault continued. With his family watching at ringside, Gowen's only leg was [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Work (verb)|worked]] over by Lesnar using his signature F5 maneuver and the steel ring post. Gowen's mother intervened to end the attack. Weeks later, Lesnar kidnapped Gowen, who now used a wheelchair, and threw him down a flight of stairs. As a result, on July 31, 2003, Gowen was the object of a feature report on ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown!]]'' and was not seen on-screen for over a month.

When he returned, Gowen continued a previous short-lived feud with [[Matt Hardy]] (which had been originally [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Abort|abort]]ed to institute the Lesnar heel [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Angle|angle]]). Hardy was reportedly jealous that Gowen had been given a WWE contract after it took Hardy four years in development to finally make it onto the main roster. The Gowen/Hardy feud culminated at [[No Mercy (2003)|No Mercy]] where Gowen defeated Hardy (who had Shannon Moore in his corner) in a one on one match, marking his first [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Clean finish|clean victory]] in the WWE. He then lost a match with Shannon Moore thanks to Hardys' interference.

On the following episode of ''SmackDown!'' Gowen lost a clean match against [[Yoshihiro Tajiri|Tajiri]] and was not seen on-screen thereafter. Immediately after this match, Gowen was given a modified STO by two Japanese men who had aligned themselves with Tajiri. Gowen was legitimately knocked out as a result. Months later in February 2004 it was announced Gowen was released from his WWE contract.

===Independent circuit (2004-present)===
Although Gowen has taken a hiatus from the world of televised professional wrestling to pursue his college degree at [[Eastern Michigan University]], he continues to appear in his hometown of Detroit for Xtreme Intense Championship Wrestling and Independent Wrestling Revolution. He also travels and appears for independent promotions such as [[Border City Wrestling]], All American Wrestling, [[NWA Wisconsin]], Cleveland All Pro Wrestling, [[Juggalo Championship Wrestling]], [[IWA East Coast]], and more.

In All American Wrestling, he is also a part of the "''Michigan Invasion''" heel stable (along with fellow Michigan wrestlers Truth Martini, [[Nate Mattson|"Amazing" N8 Mattson]], Eddie Venom and Brian Gorie).

On April 14, 2007, Zach Gowen and his mystery partner Krotch defeated "''Michigan Invasion''" members Truth Martini and "Amazing" N8 Mattson to become new AAW Tag Team Champions.<ref name="AAW">{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/other/2007-04.html|title=Independent Wrestling Results - April 2007|accessdate=2008-07-04|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref> They would then go on to lose the titles to Trik Davis and Conrad Kennedy III in a 4-way elimination match on June 16, 2007.

Gowen continues to compete on the American indy scene most recently, July 18, 2010 where he became (MCWA) Michigan Championship Wrestling Association Heavyweight Champion by defeating "The Man With Class" Jason Harris ending Harris' 15 month reign as Champion.

===Ring of Honor (2006, 2008, 2010)===
Gowen made his [[Ring of Honor]] (ROH) debut on October 7, 2006, losing to [[Delirious (wrestler)|Delirious]] in a singles match. Gowen would later return to ROH on February 22, 2008 in [[Deer Park, New York]], immediately aligning himself with [[The Age of the Fall]]. On November 12, 2010, he appeared at an ROH show in [[Detroit]], where he was announced as the newest member of [[Truth Martini]]'s House of Truth faction. He teamed with [[ROH World Championship|ROH World Champion]] [[Roderick Strong]] and [[Michael Elgin]] in a loss to the [[Briscoe Brothers]] and [[Christopher Daniels]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2010/11/13/16121711.html|title=Edwards wins 2010 'Survival of the Fittest' as ROH returns to Detroit area|date=2010-11-13|last=Bishop|first=Matt|accessdate=2010-11-13|work=Slam!

===Juggalo Championship Wrestling (2007-2008; 2011-present)===
