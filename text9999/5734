"'''Whole Again'''" is the fifth single released from British pop [[girl group]] [[Atomic Kitten]]'s debut album, ''[[Right Now (Atomic Kitten album)|Right Now]]''. It is the group's biggest selling single to date and was the final single to feature founding member [[Kerry Katona]], who left the group mid-way through promoting the single. "Whole Again" was the first single released from the album in Europe, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. It was a massive success, reaching number one in several countries, and sold 1 million copies in the UK alone. Following the departure of Katona she was replaced a few days later by [[Jenny Frost]] just after the single reached number one in the UK, the official video was reshot and Frost vocals appeared on the reissue of the group's debut album.

==Background==
Following the failures of previous single "[[Follow Me (Atomic Kitten song)|Follow Me]]" and the initial release of their debut album, ''[[Right Now (Atomic Kitten)|Right Now]]'',<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/2538381.stm|title=Atomic Kitten's perfect year|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=BBC|date=30 December 2002|accessdate=8 July 2012}}</ref> Atomic Kitten persuaded Virgin Records to release the single as a last-ditch attempt to keep their record deal.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} They were given a shoe-string budget for the single's release with a basic video and previous photo shoots used for cover artwork.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} During promotion for the single, band member [[Kerry Katona]] announced her pregnancy and subsequent decision to leave the group.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} With the single's release imminent, the group opted to recruit [[Jenny Frost]] as a replacement and continued their promotional campaign.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} Surprisingly the single was a massive success, beating [[U2]] to the number one spot on the [[UK Singles Chart]] and remaining there for four consecutive weeks.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

The version of "Whole Again" on the Japanese version of ''[[Right Now (Atomic Kitten album)|Right Now]]'' only features Katona's vocals in all the verses and all the Atomic Kitten's vocals in the chorus.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} In a rare Asian pressing of their ''Right Now'' album, the song "Whole Again" features all lines spoken by Katona with only the chorus sung by the girls which was taken from the Japanese version of ''[[Right Now (Atomic Kitten album)|Right Now]]''.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} The original version of ''[[Right Now (Atomic Kitten album)|Right Now]]'' features Katona's vocals;{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} however, the reissue of the album features new vocals by [[Jenny Frost]].{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} This version has since replaced Katona's version for radio airplay, and it was subsequently issued as a bonus track on international versions of the group's second album, ''[[Feels So Good (Atomic Kitten album)|Feels So Good]]''.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

==Music video==
The music video for "Whole Again" was filmed on a very small budget due to the commercial failure of previous single "[[Follow Me (Atomic Kitten song)|Follow Me]]". It features the girls singing in front of a plain white background <U+2013> similar to the video for the [[Sugababes]]' debut single "[[Overload (Sugababes song)|Overload]]". The original version of the video includes Kerry Katona, who had left the group just before the song's release. Much of the video was subsequently reshot to feature new member Jenny Frost.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1742999.stm |title=SHOWBIZ &#124; McFadden and Katona tie knot |publisher=BBC News |date=2002-01-05 |accessdate=2014-04-01}}</ref>

As a result of the single's huge success in many international markets, a second music video was filmed for the U.S. release with a much larger budget. This version features the three girls walking through the streets in [[Downtown Los Angeles]] and walking out into the countryside, gradually picking up more people along the way. The video ends with the camera zooming out on the field for Atomic Kitten's old logo is invisible in a shape of a kitten. The U.S. single release never materialised in the wake of the [[September 11 attacks]], but the video can often be seen on British music television channels.

No Secrets was an American girl group with five members: Angel Faith, Carly Lewis, Erin Tanner, Jessica Fried and Jade Ryusaki.

No Secrets recorded a remake of Atomic Kitten's hit "Whole Again,"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtqOi2CmP3c |title=No Secrets - Whole Again |publisher=YouTube |date=2008-06-15 |accessdate=2014-04-01}}</ref> excluding (and unbeknownst to) Angel. Soon after singing the majority of leads in the band, Angel left the group to pursue a solo career, releasing the album ''Believe in Angels... Believe in Me'' in 2004, just as the finishing touches were being put on the second album ''Friends Forever''. No Secrets went ahead of releasing the single "Whole Again" but it did not chart. Due to the contents of Angel Faith's contract, ''Friends Forever'', was no longer able to be sold in stores.
