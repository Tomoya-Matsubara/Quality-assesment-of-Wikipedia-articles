The '''Fincups''' were a junior [[ice hockey]] team in the [[Ontario Hockey League|Ontario Major Junior Hockey League]] for 4 years, from 1974 to 1978. The team played in [[Hamilton, Ontario]] for three years, and in [[St. Catharines, Ontario]] for one. 

==History==
The '''Fincups''' were a short-lived team in the Ontario Hockey Association that was very successful on the ice, but did poorly generating revenue. The club bounced around in three outdated arenas in four years. Unable to turn much of a profit, the Fincups moved out of town, becoming the Brantford Alexanders. 

The name ''"Fincup"'' is a combination of the team's owners, Joe Finochio and the Cupido brothers, Ron and Mario. They renamed the old [[Hamilton Red Wings]] after the 1974 season; the franchise had history in Steeltown dating back to the early 1950's. The new owners hired [[Bert Templeton]] as the team's new coach. Templeton was voted winner of the [[Matt Leyden Trophy]] as Coach of the Year in his first season. Templeton was let go partway through the Fincups' fourth season and replaced by Dave Draper.

In the four short seasons that the Fincups played, the team won the [[Memorial Cup]] once, and the [[J. Ross Robertson Cup]] once. The Fincups also represented Canada at the World Junior Tournament and came away with a silver medal. 

The Fincups won the Emms Division regular season title for two consecutive years in 1975-76 & 1976-77, and the [[Hamilton Spectator Trophy]] in 1976-77 as the first overall team in the OHA regular season.

The Fincups made the OHA finals all 3 years they played out of Hamilton, and came within one win of making it four consecutive appearances in the championship series in their only year in St. Catharines.

===Memorial Cup 1976===
The Hamilton Fincups of 1976 were a small, hard-working and determined team which practiced meticulously and strived to be top condition. Their hard work won the Emms division regular season in 1976 and eliminated the [[Kitchener Rangers]], [[Toronto Marlboros]] and the [[Sudbury Wolves]] to make to the Memorial Cup hosted at the [[Montreal Forum]]. Their opponents for the 1976 national title would be the WHL's [[New Westminster Bruins]] and the QMJHL's [[Quebec Remparts]].

Hamilton lost the first game of the round-robin to Quebec 4-3, due to the 45 save performance of the Remparts goalie Barrette. The Bruins would defeat the Remparts the next day 4-2. The third game saw the Fincups score seven power play goals to beat the Bruins 8-4 in a game with many penalties, which concluded the round-robin. 

The win and the large goal differential put Hamilton directly into the final game. New Westminster would solidly beat Quebec 10-3 in the semi-final game. The next day in front of 4,350 fans at the Montreal Forum, the Fincups played a tenacious forechecking game and defeated the New Westminster Bruins 5-2 in Memorial Cup Final game. The win brought the Memorial Cup back to the "Steel City" for the first time in 14 years.

The team's move to [[St. Catharines, Ontario]] in 1977 was necessitated by the closure of the old [[Barton Street Arena]] in Hamilton. During the 1976 Memorial Cup run, the [[Hamilton Spectator]] was filled with speculation about a possible move to [[Brantford, Ontario]], as the old arena in Hamilton was obviously on its last legs. However, the city of Hamilton refused to make a decision about a new arena, and debated whether to build a 5,000-seat building for the Fincups or a 16,000 seat arena in hopes of pursuing a [[World Hockey Association]] team. In August 1976, the ice-making machinery in the dilapidated, 67-year-old barn broke down and Fincup ownership, who also owned the building, chose to demolish the battered, ancient arena rather than repair it. The team was unable to negotiate a short-term lease to use the only other semi-suitable arena in Hamilton, the [[Mountain Arena]], due to opposition from local residents, and so the homeless team was forced to move to [[St. Catharines, Ontario]], about an hour down the [[QEW]], who had recently witnessed the departure of their own OMJHL team, the [[St. Catharines Black Hawks|Black Hawks]].

Team ownership was able to negotiate a lease for Mountain Arena for the [[1977-78 OHL season]], but at the end of the year the city of Hamilton was still no closer to building a new arena than they had been two years earlier. Moreover, the team was losing money at the tiny, out of the way Mountain Arena. Out of long-term options in Hamilton, the team was moved at the end of that season to Brantford, where they were renamed the [[Brantford Alexanders]].

The heart and soul of the Fincups was their captain '''[[Dale McCourt]]'''. He led the team to the Memorial Cup title in 1976, and the Hamilton Spectator Trophy in 1977. He was voted CHL Player of the year for his efforts. There are 21 Fincups alumni who made the NHL.
