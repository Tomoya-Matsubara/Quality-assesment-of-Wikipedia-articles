'''Ion Heliade R<U+0103>dulescu''' or '''Ion Heliade''' (also known as ''Eliad'' or ''Eliade R<U+0103>dulescu''; {{IPA2|jon he.li.'a.de r<U+0259>.du.'les.ku}}; [[January 6]], [[1802]]&ndash;[[April 27]], [[1872]]) was a [[Wallachia]]n-born [[Romania]]n academic, [[Romanticism|Romantic]] and [[Classicism|Classicist]] poet, essayist, memoirist, short story writer, newspaper editor and politician. A prolific translator of foreign literature into [[Romanian language|Romanian]], he was also the author of books on [[linguistics]] and history. For much of his life, Heliade R<U+0103>dulescu was a teacher at [[Saint Sava College]] in [[Bucharest]], which he helped reopen. He was a founding member and first president of the [[Romanian Academy]]. 

Heliade R<U+0103>dulescu is considered one of the foremost champions of [[Romanian culture]] from the first half of the 19th century, having first risen to prominence through his association with [[Gheorghe Laz<U+0103>r]] and his support of Laz<U+0103>r's drive for discontinuing education in [[Greek language|Greek]]. Over the following decades, he had a major role in shaping the modern Romanian language, but caused controversy when he advocated the massive introduction of [[Italian language|Italian]] [[neologism]]s into the [[Romanian lexis]]. A [[Romantic nationalism|Romantic nationalist]] landowner siding with moderate [[Liberalism and radicalism in Romania|liberals]], Heliade was among the leaders of the [[1848 Wallachian revolution]], after which he was forced to spend several years in exile. Adopting an original form of [[conservatism]], which emphasized the role of the aristocratic [[boyar]]s in [[History of Romania|Romanian history]], he was rewarded for supporting the [[Ottoman Empire]] and clashed with the [[Radicalism (historical)|radical]] wing of the 1848 revolutionaries.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Heliade R<U+0103>dulescu was born in [[T<U+00E2>rgovi<U+015F>te]], the son of Ilie R<U+0103>dulescu, a wealthy proprietor who served as the leader of a patrol unit during the 1810s, and Eufrosina Danielopol, who had been educated in [[Greek language|Greek]].<ref name="sixtyseven">St<U+0103>nescu-Stanciu, p.67</ref> Three of his siblings died of [[bubonic plague]] before 1829.<ref name="sixtyseven"/> Throughout his early youth, Ion was the focus of his parents' affectionate supervision: early on, Ilie R<U+0103>dulescu purchased a house once owned by the scholar [[Gheorghe Laz<U+0103>r]] on the outskirts of [[Bucharest]] (near [[Obor]]), as a gift for his son.<ref name="sixtyseven"/> At the time, the R<U+0103>dulescus were owners of a large garden in the Bucharest area, nearby [[Her<U+0103>str<U+0103>u Park|Her<U+0103>str<U+0103>u]], as well as of estates in the vicinity of [[F<U+0103>g<U+0103>ra<U+015F>]] and [[G<U+00E2>rbovi]].<ref name="sixtyeight"/><ref name="sixtyseven"/>

After basic education in Greek with a [[tutor]] known as Alexe, Ion Heliade R<U+0103>dulescu taught himself reading in [[Romanian Cyrillic alphabet|Romanian Cyrillic]] (reportedly by studying the ''[[Alexander Romance]]'' with the help of his father's [[Oltenia]]n servants).<ref>M<U+0103>ciuc<U+0103>, p.VI, XXXVII; St<U+0103>nescu-Stanciu, p.67<U+2013>68</ref> He subsequently became an avid reader of popular novels, especially during his 1813 sojourn in G<U+00E2>rbovi (where he had been sent after other areas of the country came to be ravaged by ''[[Caragea's plague]]'').<ref name="sixtyeight">St<U+0103>nescu-Stanciu, p.68</ref> After 1813, the teenaged R<U+0103>dulescu was a pupil of the [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] monk [[Naum R<U+00E2>mniceanu]]; in 1815, he moved on to the Greek school at [[Schitu M<U+0103>gureanu]], in Bucharest, and, in 1818, to the [[Saint Sava College|Saint Sava School]], where he studied under Gheorghe Laz<U+0103>r's supervision.<ref>''Encyclopedia of Revolutions of 1848''; M<U+0103>ciuc<U+0103>, p.VI, XXXVII</ref> Between his 1820 graduation and 1821, when effects of the [[Wallachian uprising of 1821|Wallachian uprising]] led to School to cease its activities, he was kept as Laz<U+0103>r's assistant teacher, tutoring in [[arithmetics]] and [[geometry]].<ref>M<U+0103>ciuc<U+0103>, p.VI<U+2013>VII; XXXVII</ref><ref name="sixtyeight"/> It was during those years that he adopted the surname ''Heliade'' (also rendered ''Heliad'', ''Eliad'' or ''Eliade''), which, he later explained, was a Greek version of his [[patronymic]], in turn stemming from the Romanian version of ''[[Elijah]]''.<ref>Djuvara, p.183</ref><ref name="sixtyeight"/>

===Under Grigore Ghica===
In 1822, after Gheorghe Laz<U+0103>r had fallen ill, Heliade reopened Saint Sava and served as its main teacher (initially, without any form of remuneration).<ref name="giuonetwenty">Giurescu, p.120</ref><ref>M<U+0103>ciuc<U+0103>, p.VIII, IX<U+2013>X, XXXVII</ref><ref name="sixtyeight"/> He was later joined in this effort by other [[intellectual]]s of the day, such as [[Eufrosin Poteca]],<ref name="giuonetwenty"/><ref name="sixtyeight"/> and, eventually, also opened an art class overseen by the [[Croats|Croat]] [[Carol Val<U+015F>tain]].<ref name="oprescu31">George Oprescu (ed.), ''Scurt<U+0103> istorie a artelor plastice <U+00EE>n R.P.R.'', [[Editura Academiei|Editura Academiei RPR]], Bucharest, 1958, p.31. {{OCLC|7162839}}</ref> This re-establishment came as a result of ordinances issued by [[List of rulers of Wallachia|Prince]] [[Grigore IV Ghica]], who had just been assigned by the Ottoman Empire to the throne of Wallachia upon the disestablishment of [[Phanariotes|Phanariote]] rule, encouraging the marginalization of [[Greeks in Romania|ethnic Greeks]] who had assumed public office in previous decades.<ref name="giuonetwenty"/> Thus, Prince Ghica had endorsed education in Romanian and, in one of his official ''[[firman]]s'', defined teaching in Greek as "the foundation of evils" (''temelia r<U+0103>ut<U+0103><U+0163>ilor'').<ref name="giuonetwenty"/>

During the late 1820s, Heliade became involved in cultural policies.  In 1827, he and [[Dinicu Golescu]] founded ''So<U+0163>ietatea literar<U+0103> rom<U+00E2>neasc<U+0103>'' (the Romanian Literary Society), which, through its program (mapped out by Heliade himself), proposed Saint Sava's transformation into a [[college]], the opening of another such institution in [[Craiova]], and the creation of schools in virtually all Wallachian localities.<ref name="giuonetwenty"/><ref>M<U+0103>ciuc<U+0103>, p.VII, X, XXXVII</ref> In addition, ''So<U+0163>ietatea'' attempted to encourage the establishment of Romanian-language newspapers, calling for an end to the state monopoly on [[printing press]]es.<ref name="giuonetwenty"/><ref name="macp"/> The grouping, headquartered on central Bucharest's [[Calea Victoriei|Podul Mogo<U+015F>oaiei]], benefited from Golescu's experience abroad, and was soon joined by two future Princes, [[Gheorghe Bibescu]] and [[Barbu Dimitrie <U+015E>tirbei]].<ref name="giuonetwenty"/> Its character was based on [[Freemasonry]];<ref>''Encyclopedia of Revolutions of 1848''; Djuvara, p.317</ref> around that time, Heliade is known to have become a Freemason, as did a large section of his generation.<ref>Djuvara, p.317; {{ro icon}} [[Dan Amedeo L<U+0103>z<U+0103>rescu]], [http://www.itcnet.ro/history/archive/mi1998/current6/mi10.htm "1848: Revolu<U+0163>ia intelectualilor"], in ''Magazin Istoric'', June 1998</ref>

In 1828, Heliade published his first work, an essay on [[Romanian grammar]], in the [[Transylvania]]n city of [[Sibiu|Hermannstadt]] (which was part of the [[Austrian Empire]] at the time), and, on [[April 20]], [[1829]], began printing the Bucharest-based paper ''[[Curierul Rom<U+00E2>nesc]]''.<ref name="giurtwenfiv">Giurescu, p.125</ref><ref>M<U+0103>ciuc<U+0103>, p.X<U+2013>XI, XXXVIII</ref> This was the most successful of several attempts to create a local newspaper, something Golescu first attempted in 1828.<ref name="giurtwenfiv"/> Publishing articles in both Romanian and [[French language|French]], ''Curierul Rom<U+00E2>nesc'' had, starting in 1836, its own literary supplement, under the title of ''[[Curier de Ambe Sexe]]''; in print until 1847, it notably published one of Heliade's most famous poems, ''[[Zbur<U+0103>torul]]''.<ref>Giurescu, p.125, 126; M<U+0103>ciuc<U+0103>, p.XI<U+2013>XII</ref> ''Curierul Rom<U+00E2>nesc'' was edited as a weekly, and later as a bimonthly, until 1839, when it began to be issued three or four times a week. Its best-known contributors were Heliade himself, [[Grigore Alexandrescu]], [[Costache Negruzzi]], [[Dimitrie Bolintineanu]], [[Ioan Catina]], [[Vasile C<U+00E2>rlova]], and [[Iancu V<U+0103>c<U+0103>rescu]].<ref>M<U+0103>ciuc<U+0103>, p.XI</ref>

In 1823, Heliade met Maria Alexandrescu, with whom he fell passionately in love, and whom he later married.<ref name="sixtyeight"/> By 1830, the Heliades' two children, a son named Virgiliu and a daughter named Virgilia, died in infancy; subsequently, their marriage entered a long period of crisis, marked by Maria's frequent outbursts of jealousy.<ref name="sixtyeight"/> Ion Heliade probably had a number of extra-marital affairs: a [[Wallachian military forces|Wallachian Militia]] officer named Zalic, who became known during the 1840s, is thought by some, including the literary critic [[George C<U+0103>linescu]], to have been the writer's illegitimate son.<ref name="sixtyeight"/> Before the death of her first child, Maria Heliade welcomed into her house Grigore Alexandrescu, himself a celebrated writer, whom Ion suspected had become her lover.<ref name="sixtyeight"/> Consequently, the two authors became bitter rivals: Ion Heliade referred to Alexandrescu as "that ingrate", and, in an 1838 letter to [[George Bari<U+0163>]], downplayed his poetry and character (believing that, in one of his [[fable]]s, Alexandrescu had depicted himself as a [[nightingale]], he commented that, in reality, he was "a piteous [[Rook (bird)|rook]] dressed in foreign feathers").<ref name="sixtyeight"/> Despite these household conflicts, Maria Heliade gave birth to five other children, four daughters and one son (Ion, born 1846).<ref name="stansixtynine">St<U+0103>nescu-Stanciu, p.69</ref>

===Printer and court poet===

In October of 1830, together with his uncle Nicolae R<U+0103>dulescu, he opened the first privately-owned printing press in his country, operating on his property at ''Ci<U+015F>meaua Mavrogheni'', in [[Obor]] (the land went by the name of ''C<U+00E2>mpul lui Eliad''&mdash;"Eliad's Field", and housed several other large buildings).<ref name="macp"/><ref name="stansixtynine"/> Among the first works he published was a collection of poems by [[Alphonse de Lamartine]], translated by Heliade from [[French language|French]], and grouped together with some of his own poems.<ref name="macp">M<U+0103>ciuc<U+0103>, p.XXXVIII</ref> Later, he translated a textbook on [[Meter (poetry)|meter]] and [[Louis-Benjamin Francoeur]]'s standard manual of ''Arithmetics'', as well as works by [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] authors &mdash; [[Voltaire]]'s ''[[Mahomet (play)|Mahomet, ou le fanatisme]]'', and stories by [[Jean-Fran<U+00E7>ois Marmontel]].<ref name="macp"/> They were followed, in 1839, by a version of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]'s ''[[Julie, or the New Heloise]]''.<ref name="macp"/>

Heliade began a career as a [[Civil service|civil servant]] after the ''[[Postelnic]]ie'' commissioned him to print the ''[[Monitorul Oficial|Official Bulletin]]'', and later climbed through the [[Historical Romanian ranks and titles|official hierarchy]], eventually serving as ''[[Clucer]]''.<ref name="stansixtynine"/> This rise coincided with the establishment of the ''[[Regulamentul Organic]]'' regime, inaugurated, upon the end of the [[Russo-Turkish War (1828-1829)|Russo-Turkish War of 1828<U+2013>1829]], by a [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russian]] administration under [[Pavel Kiselyov]].<ref name="stansixtynine"/> When Kiselyov placed an order with Heliade for the printing of official documents, including the ''Regulament'', the writer and his family were made prosperous by the sales. Nevertheless, Heliade maintained contacts with the faction of reformist [[boyar]]s: in 1833, together with [[Ion C<U+00E2>mpineanu]], [[Iancu V<U+0103>c<U+0103>rescu]], [[Ioan Voinescu II]], [[Constantin Aristia]], [[<U+015E>tefan Golescu|<U+015E>tefan]] and [[Nicolae Golescu]], as well as others, he founded the short-lived ''So<U+0163>ietatea Filarmonic<U+0103>'' (the Philharmonic Society), which advanced a cultural agenda (and was especially active in raising funds for the [[National Theatre Bucharest|National Theater of Wallachia]]).<ref>''Encyclopedia of Revolutions of 1848''; M<U+0103>ciuc<U+0103>, p.VII, XII<U+2013>XIII, XXXVIII</ref> Aside from its stated cultural goals, ''So<U+0163>ietatea Filarmonic<U+0103>'' continued a covert political activity.<ref>''Encyclopedia of Revolutions of 1848''; Giurescu, p.131; M<U+0103>ciuc<U+0103>, p.XII</ref>

In 1834, when [[List of rulers of Wallachia|Prince]] [[Alexandru II Ghica]] came to the throne, Heliade became one of his close collaborators, styling himself "court poet".<ref name="stansixtynine"/> Several of the poems and discourses he authored during the period are written as [[panegyric]]s, and dedicated to Ghica, whom Heliade depicted as an ideal prototype of a monarch.<ref name="stansixtynine"/> As young reformists came into conflict with the prince, he kept his neutrality, arguing that all sides involved represented a privileged minority, and that the disturbances were equivalent to "the quarrel of wolves and the noise made by those in higher positions over the torn-apart animal that is the peasant".<ref name="stansixtynine"/> He was notably critical of the [[Radicalism (historical)|radical]] [[Mitic<U+0103> Filipescu]], whom he satirized in the poem ''C<U+0103>derea dracilor'' ("The Demons' Fall"), and later defined his own position with the words "I hate [[tyrant]]s. I fear [[Anomie|anarchy]]".<ref>M<U+0103>ciuc<U+0103>, p.VII</ref>

It was also in 1834 that Heliade began teaching at the ''So<U+0163>ietatea Filarmonic<U+0103>'''s school (alongside Aristia and the musician [[Ioan Andrei Wachmann]]), and published his first translations from [[George Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Lord Byron]] (in 1847, he completed the translation of Byron's ''[[Don Juan (Byron)|Don Juan]]'').<ref>M<U+0103>ciuc<U+0103>, p.X</ref><ref name="macp"/><ref name="macixxx"/> The next year, he began printing ''Gazeta Teatrului Na<U+0163>ional'' (official voice of the National Theater, published until 1836), and translated [[Moli<U+00E8>re]]'s ''[[Amphitryon]]'' into Romanian.<ref>M<U+0103>ciuc<U+0103>, p.XII, XXXVIII</ref> In 1839, Heliade also translated [[Miguel de Cervantes]]' ''[[Don Quixote]]'' from a French source.<ref name="macp"/> The first collection of his own prose and poetry works saw print in 1836.<ref name="macp"/> Interested in the development of [[Art of Romania|local art]], he contributed a [[brochure]] on drawing and architecture in 1837, and, during the same year, opened the first permanent exhibit in Wallachia (featuring copies of Western paintings, portraits, and [[gypsum]] [[Casting|casts]] of various known sculptures).<ref name="oprescu31"/>

By the early 1840s, Heliade began expanding on his notion that modern Romanian needed to emphasize its connections with other [[Romance languages]] through [[neologism]]s from [[Italian language|Italian]], and, to this goal, he published ''Paralelism <U+00EE>ntre limba rom<U+00E2>n<U+0103> <U+015F>i italian<U+0103>'' ("Parallelism between the Romanian language and Italian", 1840) and ''Paralelism <U+00EE>ntre dialectele rom<U+00E2>n <U+015F>i italian sau forma ori gramatica acestor dou<U+0103> dialecte'' ("Parallelism between the Romanian and Italian Dialects or the Form or Grammar of These Two Dialects", 1841).<ref name="macixxx">M<U+0103>ciuc<U+0103>, p.XXXIX</ref> The two books were followed by a [[compendium]], ''Prescurtare de gramatica limbei rom<U+00E2>no-italiene'' ("Summary of the Grammar of the Romanian-Italian Language"), and, in 1847, by a comprehensive list of Romanian words that had originated in [[Slavic languages|Slavic]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], and [[German language|German]] (''see [[Romanian lexis]]'').<ref name="macixxx"/> By 1846, he was planning to begin work on a "universal library", which was to include, among other books, the major the philosophical writings of, among others, [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[Roger Bacon]], [[Ren<U+00E9> Descartes]], [[Baruch Spinoza]], [[John Locke]], [[Gottfried Leibniz]], [[David Hume]], [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]] and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]].<ref>C<U+0103>linescu, p.64</ref>

===1848 Revolution===
{{main|Wallachian Revolution of 1848}}
[[Image:Radulescu1848.jpg|thumb|200px|Heliade in 1848, detail of a group portrait of Provisional Government members]]
Before Alexandru Ghica was replaced with [[Gheorghe Bibescu]], his relations with Heliade had soured.<ref name="stansixtynine"/> In contrast with his earlier call for moderation, the writer decided to side with the [[Liberalism and radicalism in Romania|liberal current]] in its [[Conspiracy (political)|conspiratorial]] opposition to Bibescu.<ref name="giuthirt">Giurescu, p.132</ref><ref name="macixxx"/><ref name="stansixtynine"/> The so-called "Trandafiloff affair" of early 1844 was essential in this process &mdash; it was provoked by Bibescu's decision to lease all Wallachian mines to a Russian engineer named [[Alexander Trandafiloff]], a measure considered illegal by the [[Sfatul boieresc|Assembly]] and ultimately ending in Bibescu's decision to dissolve his legislative.<ref name="isar">Isar</ref> These events made Heliade publish a [[pamphlet]] titled ''M<U+0103>ce<U+015F>ul'' ("The [[Rosa rubiginosa|Eglantine]]"), which was heavily critical of Russian influence and reportedly sold over 30,000 copies.<ref name="isar"/> It was centered on the pun alluding to Trandafiloff's name &mdash; ''trandafir cu of <U+00EE>n coad<U+0103>'' (lit. "a rose ending in -of", but also "a rose with grief for a stem").<ref name="isar"/> Making additional covert reference to Trandafiloff as "the eglantine", it featured the lyrics:

In spring 1848, when the first [[Revolutions of 1848|European revolutions]] had erupted, Heliade was attracted into cooperation with ''Fr<U+0103><U+0163>ia'', a [[secret society]] founded by [[Nicolae B<U+0103>lcescu]], [[Ion Ghica]], [[Christian Tell]], and [[Alexandru G. Golescu]], and sat on its leadership committee.<ref name="giuthirt"/> He also collaborated with the reform-minded [[France|French]] teacher [[Jean Alexandre Vaillant]], who was ultimately expelled after his activities were brought to the attention of authorities.<ref>Iorga, ''La Monarchie de juillet et les Roumains''</ref> On [[April 19]], [[1848]], following financial setbacks, ''[[Curierul Rom<U+00E2>nesc]]'' ceased printing (this prompted Heliade to write ''C<U+00E2>ntecul ursului'', "The Bear's Song", a piece ridiculing his political enemies).<ref>M<U+0103>ciuc<U+0103>, p.XI, XXIX</ref>

Heliade progressively distanced himself from the more radical groups, especially after discussions began on the issue of [[land reform]] and the disestablishment of the [[boyar]] class. Initially, he accepted the reforms, and, after the matter was debated within ''Fr<U+0103><U+0163>ia'' just before rebellion broke out, he issued a resolution acknowledging this (the document was probably inspired by [[Nicolae B<U+0103>lcescu]]).<ref name="giuthirtthree">Giurescu, p.133</ref> The compromise also set other goals, including national independence, [[responsible government]], [[civil rights]] and equality, universal taxation, a larger Assembly, five-year terms of office for Princes (and their election by the [[Sfatul boieresc|National Assembly]]), [[freedom of the press]], and [[decentralization]].<ref name="giuthirtthree"/> On [[June 21]], [[1848]], present in [[Turnu M<U+0103>gurele|Islaz]] alongside Tell and the [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] priest known as [[Popa <U+015E>apc<U+0103>]], he read out these goals to a cheering crowd, in what was to be the effective start of the uprising (''see [[Proclamation of Islaz]]'').<ref>''Encyclopedia of Revolutions of 1848''; Djuvara, p.331</ref><ref name="giuthirtthree"/> Four days after the Islaz events, the revolution succeeded in toppling Bibescu, whom it replaced with a Provisional Government which immediately attracted Russian hostility. Presided over by [[Metropolitan of Hungro-Wallachia|Metropolitan]] [[Neofit]], it included Heliade, who was also Minister of Education, as well as Tell, [[<U+015E>tefan Golescu]], [[Gheorghe Magheru]], and, for a short while, the Bucharest merchant [[Gheorghe Scurti]].<ref>Giurescu, p.134</ref>

Disputes regarding the shape of land reform continued, and in late July, the Government created  ''Comisia propriet<U+0103><U+0163>ii'' (the Commission on Property), representing both peasants and landlords and overseen by [[Alexandru Racovi<U+0163><U+0103>]] and [[Ion Ionescu de la Brad]].<ref name="githirfive">Giurescu, p.135</ref> It too failed to reach a compromise over the amount of land to be allocated to peasants, and it was ultimately recalled by Heliade, who indicated that the matter was to be deliberated once a new Assembly had been voted into office.<ref name="githirfive"/> In time, the writer adopted a [[Conservatism|conservative]] outlook in respect to boyar tradition, developing a singular view of [[History of Romania|Romanian history]] around the issues of property and rank in Wallachia.<ref>Boia, p.43, 48<U+2013>49</ref> In the words of historian [[Nicolae Iorga]]: "Eliad had wanted to lead, as [[dictator]], this movement that added liberal institutions to the old society that had been almost completely maintained in place".<ref>Iorga, ''La R<U+00E9>volution de 1848<U+2026>''</ref>

Like most other revolutionaries, Heliade favored maintaining good relations with the Ottoman Empire, Wallachia's [[Suzerainty|suzerain]] power, hoping that this policy could help counter Russian pressures.<ref name="githirfive"/><ref name="macixxx"/> As [[Ottoman Dynasty|Sultan]] [[Abd<U+00FC>lmecid]] was assessing the situation, [[S<U+00FC>leyman Pa<U+015F>a]] was dispatched to Bucharest, where he advised the revolutionaries to carry on with their diplomatic efforts, and ordered the Provisional Government to be replaced by ''Locotenen<U+0163>a domneasc<U+0103>'', a [[triumvirate]] of [[Regency|regents]] comprising Heliade, Tell, and [[Nicolae Golescu]].<ref name="githirfive"/> Nonetheless, the Ottomans were pressured by Russia into joining a clampdown on revolutionary forces, which resulted, during September, in the reestablishment of ''[[Regulamentul Organic]]'' and its system of government.<ref>Djuvara, p.331; Giurescu, p.135<U+2013>137</ref> Together with Tell, Heliade sought refuge at the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] consulate in Bucharest, where they were hosted by [[Robert Gilmour Colquhoun]] in exchange for a deposit of [[Austro-Hungarian gulden|Austrian florins]].<ref>Giurescu, p.137</ref>

Leaving his family behind, he was allowed to pass into the [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]]-ruled [[Banat]], before moving into self-exile in [[France]] while his wife and children were sent to Ottoman lands.<ref name="macixxx"/><ref name="stanseven"/><ref name="stansixtynine"/> In 1850<U+2013>1851, several of his memoirs of the revolution, written in both Romanian and French, were published in [[Paris]], the city were he had taken residence.<ref>Iorga, ''La R<U+00E9>volution de 1848<U+2026>''; M<U+0103>ciuc<U+0103>, p.XXXIX</ref> He shared his exile with Tell and Magheru, as well as with [[Nicolae Rusu Locusteanu]].<ref>Iorga, ''La R<U+00E9>volution de 1848<U+2026>''</ref>

It was during his time in Paris that he met with [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], the [[Anarchism|anarchist]] philosopher who had come to advance a moderate project around small-scale property (to counter both [[economic liberalism]] and [[socialism]]).<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.268<U+2013>269</ref> Heliade used this opportunity to make the Romanian cause known to the staff of Proudhon's ''La Voix de Peuple''.<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.268</ref> Major French publications to which he contributed included ''[[La Presse (France)|La Presse]]'', ''[[La Semaine]]'', and ''[[Le Si<U+00E8>cle]]'', where he also helped publicize political issues pertaining to his native land.<ref>''Encyclopedia of Revolutions of 1848''</ref> Heliade was credited with having exercised influence over historian [[<U+00C9>lias Regnault]]; [[Nicolae Iorga]] argued that Regnault's discarded his own arguments in favor of a unified Romanian state to include [[Transylvania]] (a concept which Heliade had come to resent), as well amending his earlier account of the 1848 events, after being exposed to "Eliad's [[propaganda]]".<ref>Iorga, ''La R<U+00E9>volution de 1848<U+2026>''</ref>

While claiming to represent the entire body of Wallachian ''[[<U+00E9>migr<U+00E9>]]s'',<ref>M<U+0103>ciuc<U+0103>, p.VII</ref> Heliade had by then grown disappointed with the political developments, and, in his private correspondence, commented that [[Romanians]] in general were "idle", "womanizing", as well as having "the petty and base envies of women", and argued that they required "supervision [and] leadership".<ref name="stanseven">St<U+0103>nescu-Stanciu, p.70</ref> His fortune was declining, especially after pressures began for him to pay his many debts, and he often lacked the funds for basic necessities.<ref name="stanseven"/> At the time, he continuously clashed with other former revolutionaries, including B<U+0103>lcescu, [[C. A. Rosetti]], and the Golescus, who resented his ambiguous stance in respect to reforms, and especially his willingness to accept ''Regulamentul Organic'' as an instrument of power; Heliade issued the first in a series of [[pamphlet]]s condemning young radicals, contributing to factionalism inside the ''<U+00E9>migr<U+00E9>'' camp.<ref>''Encyclopedia of Revolutions of 1848''</ref> His friendship with Tell also soured, after Heliade began speculating that the revolutionary general was committing [[adultery]] with Maria.<ref name="stanseven"/>

In 1851, Heliade reunited with his family on the island of [[Chios]], where they stayed until 1854.<ref name="macixxx"/><ref name="stanseven"/> Following the evacuation of Russian troops from the [[Danubian Principalities]] during the [[Crimean War]], Heliade was appointed by the [[Porte]] to represent the Romanian nation in [[Shumen]], as part of [[Omar Pasha]]'s staff.<ref name="macixxx"/> Again expressing sympathy for the Ottoman cause, he was rewarded with the title of ''[[Bey]]''.<ref name="macixxx"/> According to Iorga, Heliade's attitudes reflected his hope of "recovering the power lost" in 1848;<ref>Iorga, ''La R<U+00E9>volution de 1848<U+2026>''</ref> the historian also stressed that Omar never actually made use of Heliade's services.<ref>Iorga, ''La guerre de Crim<U+00E9>e<U+2026>''</ref>

Later in the same year, he decided to return to Bucharest, but his stay was cut short when the Austrian authorities, who, under the leadership of [[Johann Coronini-Cronberg]], had taken over administration of the country as a neutral force, asked for him to be expelled.<ref name="macixxx"/> Returning to Paris, Heliade continued to publish works on political and cultural issues, including an analysis of the [[Europe]]an situation after the [[Treaty of Paris (1856)|Peace Treaty of 1856]] and an 1858 essay on the [[Bible]].<ref name="macixxx"/> In 1859, he published his own translation of the [[Septuagint]], under the name ''Biblia sacr<U+0103> ce cuprinde Noul <U+015F>i Vechiul Testament'' ("The Holy Bible, Comprising the [[New Testament|New]] and [[Old Testament]]").<ref name="macxl">M<U+0103>ciuc<U+0103> p. XL</ref>

As former revolutionaries, grouped in the ''[[Partida Na<U+0163>ional<U+0103>]]'' faction, advanced the idea of union between Wallachia and [[Moldavia]] in election for the [[ad-hoc Divan]], Heliade opted not to endorse any particular candidate, while rejecting outright the candidature of former prince [[Alexandru II Ghica]] (in a private letter, he stated: "let them elect whomever [of the candidates for the throne], for he would still have the heart of a man and some principles of a Romanian; only don't let that creature [Ghica] be elected, for he is capable of going to the dogs with this country").<ref name="stanseven"/>

===Final years===
[[Image:Heliade 1850s.jpg|thumb|200px|Photograph of an aging Heliade R<U+0103>dulescu]]
Later in 1859, Heliade returned to Bucharest, which had become the capital of the United Principalities after the common election of [[Alexander John Cuza]] and later that of an internationally-recognized [[Kingdom of Romania|Principality of Romania]]. It was during that period that he again added ''R<U+0103>dulescu'' to his surname.<ref>Giurescu, p.132</ref> Until his death, he published influential volumes on a variety of issues, while concentrating on contributions to history and literary criticism, and editing a new collection of his own poems. In 1863, ''[[Domnitor]]'' Cuza awarded him an annual [[pension]] of 2,000 [[Romanian leu|lei]].<ref name="macxl"/>

One year after the creation of the [[Romanian Academy]] (under the name of "Academic Society"), he was elected its first President (1867), serving until his death.<ref name="macxl"/> In 1869, Heliade and [[Alexandru Papiu-Ilarian]] successfully proposed the [[Italy|Italian]] diplomat and [[Philology|philologist]] [[Giovenale Vegezzi-Ruscalla]] as honorary member of the Academy.<ref>Gabriel <U+015E>trempel, "Pagini de istorie academic<U+0103>. Alexandru Papiu-Ilarian", in ''Magazin Istoric'', June 1995, p.46</ref> By then, like most other 1848 Romantics, he had become the target of criticism from the younger generation of intellectuals, represented by the [[Ia<U+015F>i]]-based literary society ''[[Junimea]]''; in 1865, during one of its early public sessions, ''Junimea'' explictly rejected works by Heliade and [[Iancu V<U+0103>c<U+0103>rescu]].<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.44</ref> 

During the [[Romanian general election, 1866|elections of 1866]], Heliade R<U+0103>dulescu won a seat in the [[Chamber of Deputies of Romania|Chamber]] as a deputy for the city of [[T<U+00E2>rgovi<U+015F>te]].<ref name="stanseven"/> As Cuza had been ousted from power by a coalition of political groupings, he was the only Wallachian deputy to join [[Nicolae Ionescu]] and other disciples of [[Simion B<U+0103>rnu<U+0163>iu]] in opposing the appointment of [[Carol I of Romania|Carol of Hohenzollern]] as ''Domnitor'' and a proclamation stressing the perpetuity of the Moldo-Wallachian union.<ref>Kellogg, p.22<U+2013>23</ref> Speaking in [[Parliament of Romania|Parliament]], he likened the adoption of foreign rule to the [[Phanariotes|Phanariote]] period.<ref name="kell">Kellogg, p.23</ref> The opposition was nevertheless weak, and the resolution was passed with a large majority.<ref name="kell"/>

Among Ion Heliade R<U+0103>dulescu's last printed works were a textbook on [[poetics]] (1868) and a volume on Romanian [[orthography]].<ref name="macxl"/> By that time, he had come to consider himself a [[prophet]]-like figure, and the redeemer of his motherland,<ref>''Encyclopedia of Revolutions of 1848''; C<U+0103>linescu, p.66<U+2013>67</ref> notably blessing his friends with the words "[[Christ]] and [[Mary Magdalene|Magdalene]] be with you!"<ref>C<U+0103>linescu, p.67</ref> His mental health declining, he died at his Bucharest residence on Polon<U+0103> Street, nr. 20.<ref name="stanseven"/> Heliade R<U+0103>dulescu's grandiose [[funeral]] ceremony attracted a large number of his admirers;<ref name="stanseven"/> the coffin was buried in the courtyard of the Mavrogheni Church.<ref name="macxl"/>

==Heliade and the Romanian language==
[[Image:Open air school, 1842.jpg|thumb|320px|A typical open-air religious school in [[Bucharest]] during the 1840s]]
===Early proposals===
Heliade's most influential contributions are related to his interest in developing the modern [[Romanian language]], in which he synthesized [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] tenets and [[Romantic nationalism|Romantic nationalist]] ideals of the 1848 generation.<ref name="macxv">M<U+0103>ciuc<U+0103>, p.XV</ref> At a time when Romanian was being discarded by the educated in favor of [[French language|French]] or [[Greek language|Greek]], he and his supporters argued in favor of adapting Romanian to the requirements of [[modernization]]; he wrote: "Young people, preoccupy yourselves with the national language, speak and write in it; prepare yourselves for its study, for its cultivation, &mdash; and cultivating a language means to write in it about all sciences and arts, about all eras and peoples. The language alone unites, strengthens and defines a nation; preoccupy yourselves with it first and foremost, as, through this, you shall be carrying out the most fundamental of policies, you shall be laying the foundation of nationality".<ref name="macxv"/>

Heliade inaugurated his series of proposals for reforming the language in 1828, when his work on [[Romanian grammar]] called for the [[Romanian Cyrillic alphabet|Cyrillic script]] to be reduced to 27 letters, reflecting [[phonetic spelling]] (for this rule, Heliade cited the example of the [[Latin alphabet]] as used in [[Ancient Rome]]).<ref>M<U+0103>ciuc<U+0103>, p.XVI</ref> Soon after, he began a campaign in favor of introducing [[Romance languages|Romance]] [[neologism]]s, which he wanted to adapt to Romanian spelling.<ref>M<U+0103>ciuc<U+0103>, p.XVI<U+2013>XVII</ref> By that time, Romanians in various regions had grown aware of the need to unify the [[Romanian dialects|varieties of Romanian]] and create a standard [[Romanian lexis]]: this notion was first supported by the [[Transylvania]]ns [[Gheorghe <U+015E>incai]] and [[Petru Maior]], whose proposal was to unite Romanian around the language used in church services, both [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] and [[Romanian Church United with Rome, Greek-Catholic|Greek-Catholic]] (''see [[Transylvanian School]]'').<ref>M<U+0103>ciuc<U+0103>, p.XVII</ref> Heliade, who first proposed a [[Standard language|language regulator]] (an idea which was to be employed in creating the [[Romanian Academy]]), expanded on this legacy, while stressing that the dialect spoken in [[Muntenia]], which had formed the basis of religious texts published by the 16th century printer [[Coresi]], serve as the standard language.<ref>M<U+0103>ciuc<U+0103>, p.XVII<U+2013>XVIII</ref> 

In addition, he advocated [[Aesthetics|aesthetical]] guidelines in respect to the standard shape of Romanian, stressing three basic principles in selecting words: "proper wording", which called for [[vernacular]] words of [[Latin]] origin to be prioritized; "harmony", which meant that words of Latin origin were to be used in their most popular form, even in cases where [[Phonaesthetics|euphony]] had been altered by prolonged usage; and "energy", through which Heliade favored the primacy of the shortest and most expressive of [[synonym]]s used throughout Romanian-speaking areas.<ref>M<U+0103>ciuc<U+0103>, p.XVIII</ref> In parallel, Heliade frowned upon [[Linguistic purism|purist]] policies of removing widely-used neologisms of foreign origin &mdash; arguing that these were "a fatality", he indicated that the gains of such a process would have been shadowed by the losses.<ref name="macxix">M<U+0103>ciuc<U+0103>, p.XIX</ref>

These early theories exercised a lasting influence, and, when the work of unifying Romanian was accomplished in the late 19th century, they were used as a source of inspiration: Romania's major poet of the period, [[Mihai Eminescu]], himself celebrated for having created the modern [[literary language]], gave praise to Heliade for "writing just as [the language] is spoken".<ref name="macxix"/> This assessment was shared by [[Ovid Densusianu]], who wrote: "Thinking of how people wrote back then, in thick, drawly, sleepy phrases, Heliade thus shows himself superior to all his contemporaries, and <U+2026> we can consider him the first prose writer who brings in the note of [[Modern literature|modernity]]".<ref>M<U+0103>ciuc<U+0103>, p.XXXI<U+2013>XXXII</ref>

===Italian influence===
A second period in Heliade's linguistic researches, inaugurated when he adopted [[<U+00C9>tienne Bonnot de Condillac|<U+00C9>tienne Condillac]]'s theory that a language could be developed from conventions, eventually brought about the rejection of his own earlier views.<ref name="macxix"/> By the early 1840s, he postulated that Romanian and [[Italian language|Italian]] were not distinct languages, but rather dialects of Latin, which prompted him to declare the necessity of replacing Romanian words with "superior" Italian ones.<ref name="curente">Ibr<U+0103>ileanu, ''Amestec de curente<U+2026>''</ref><ref>M<U+0103>ciuc<U+0103>, p.XIX<U+2013>XX</ref> One of his [[stanza]]s, using his version of the [[Romanian alphabet|Romanian Latin alphabet]], read:
<blockquote>Primi au{{unicode|<U+1E11>}}i-vor quel sutteranu resunetu<br><U+015E>i primi salta-vor afara din gr<U+00F4>pa<br>Sacri Poe<U+0163>i que prea u<U+015F>or<U+00E2> <U+0163><U+00EA>rin<U+00E2>i<br>Copere, <U+015F>i qu<U+00E2>ror pu<U+0163>in d'uman picioarele <U+00EE>mplumb<U+0103>.<ref>C<U+0103>linescu, p.65</ref></blockquote>

Approximated into modern Romanian and English, this is:
{| width="100%"
|- valign="top"

Primii auzi-vor acel subteran r<U+0103>sunet<br>

The target of criticism and ridicule, these principles were dismissed by Eminescu as "errors" and "[[A priori (languages)|a priori systems]] of [[orthography]]".<ref name="emin">Eminescu, in "Aprecieri critice", p.207; M<U+0103>ciuc<U+0103>, p.XX</ref> During their existence, they competed with both [[August Treboniu Laurian]]'s adoption of strong Latin mannerisms and the inconsistent [[Francization|Francized]] system developed in Moldavia by [[Gheorghe Asachi]], which, according to the 20th century literary critic [[Garabet Ibr<U+0103>ileanu]], constituted "the [[boyar]] language of his time".<ref name="curente"/> Ibr<U+0103>ileanu also noted that Asachi had come to admire Heliade's attempts, and had praised them as an attempt to revive the language "spoken by [[Trajan]]'s men" &mdash; in reference to [[Roman Dacia]].<ref name="curente"/>

While defending the role Moldavian politicians in the 1840s had in shaping modern Romanian culture, Ibr<U+0103>ileanu argued that practices such as those of Heliade and Laurian carried the risk of "suppressing the Romanian language", and credited [[Alecu Russo]], more than his successors at ''[[Junimea]]'', with providing a passionate defense of spoken Romanian.<ref name="ibrail">Ibr<U+0103>ileanu, ''Evolu<U+0163>ia spiritului critic<U+2026>''</ref> He notably cited Russo's verdict: "The modern political hatred aimed at [Russia] has thrown us into Italianism, into Frenchism, and into other -isms, that were not and are not Romanianism, but the political perils, in respect to the enslavement of the Romanian soul, have since passed; true Romanianism ought to hold its head up high".<ref name="ibrail"/> The literary critic [[George C<U+0103>linescu]] also connected Heliade's experimentation to his [[Anti-Russian sentiment|Russophobia]], in turn reflecting his experiences as a revolutionary: "Hating [[Slavic languages|Slavism]] and the Russians, who had striven to underline [Slavic influences in Romanian], he said to himself that he was to serve his motherland by discarding all Slavic vestiges".<ref name="calsixfive">C<U+0103>linescu, p.65</ref> C<U+0103>linescu notably attributed Heliade's inconsistency to his "[[autodidacticism]]", which, he contended, was responsible for "[his] casual implication in all issues, the unexpected move from common sense ideas to the most insane theories".<ref>C<U+0103>linescu, p.64-65</ref> 

Overall, Heliade's experiments had marginal appeal, and their critics (Eminescu included) contrasted them with Heliade's own tenets.<ref name="calsixfive"/><ref name="emin"/> Late in his life, Heliade seems to have acknowledged this, notably writing; "This language, as it is written today by people who can speak Romanian, is my work".<ref>M<U+0103>ciuc<U+0103>, p.XXIV</ref> One of the few authors to be influenced by the theory was the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] poet [[Alexandru Macedonski]], who, during his youth, wrote several pieces in Heliade's Italian-sounding Romanian.<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.346, 365<U+2013>366</ref> Despite Heliade's thesis being largely rejected, some of its practical effects on everyday language were very enduring, especially in cases where Italian words were borrowed as a means to illustrate nuances and concepts for which Romanian had no equivalent.<ref name="calsixsix">C<U+0103>linescu, p.66</ref> These include ''afabil'' ("affable"), ''adorabil'' ("adorable"), ''colosal'' ("colossal"), ''implacabil'' ("implacable"), ''inefabil'' ("ineffable"), ''inert'' ("inert"), ''mistic'' ("mystical"), ''pervers'' ("perverse" or "pervert"), ''suav'' ("suave"), and ''venerabil'' ("venerable").<ref name="calsixsix"/>

==Literature==
===Tenets===
Celebrated as the founder of Wallachian [[Romanticism]], Heliade was equally influenced by [[Classicism]] and the [[Age of Enlightenment]].<ref>Djuvara, p.315; M<U+0103>ciuc<U+0103>, p.XX<U+2013>XXI; [[Alexandru Rosetti]] and Ion Ghe<U+0163>a, in "Aprecieri critice", p.212<U+2013>213</ref> His work, written in a special cultural context (where Classiciasm and Romanticism coexisted), took the middle path between two opposing camps: the Romantics ([[Alecu Russo]], [[Mihail Kog<U+0103>lniceanu]] and others) and the Classicists ([[Gheorghe Asachi]], [[Grigore Alexandrescu]], [[George Baronzi]] etc.).<ref>M<U+0103>ciuc<U+0103>, p.XXI</ref> [[George C<U+0103>linescu]] defined Heliade as "a devourer of books", noting that his favorites, who all played a part in shaping his style and were many times the subject of his translations, included: [[Alphonse de Lamartine]], [[Dante Aligheri]], [[Ludovico Ariosto]], [[Torquato Tasso]], [[Voltaire]], [[Jean-Fran<U+00E7>ois Marmontel]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], and [[Fran<U+00E7>ois-Ren<U+00E9> de Chateaubriand]].<ref>C<U+0103>linescu, p.64</ref> 

His poetic style, influenced from early on by Lamartine, was infused with Classicism during his middle age, before he again adopted Romantic tenets.<ref>M<U+0103>ciuc<U+0103>, p.XXV; [[Alexandru Rosetti]] and Ion Ghe<U+0163>a, in "Aprecieri critice", p.212</ref> Initially making use of guidelines set by [[Nicolas Boileau-Despr<U+00E9>aux]] in respect to poetry, he came to oppose them after reading [[Victor Hugo]]'s Romantic preface to ''[[Cromwell (play)|Cromwell]]'' (without ever discarding them altogether).<ref>[[Alexandru Rosetti]] and Ion Ghe<U+0163>a, in "Aprecieri critice", p.212<U+2013>213</ref> 

Like the Classicists, Heliade favored a literature highlighting "types" of characters, as the union of universal traits and particular characteristics, but, like the Romantics, he encouraged writers to write from a [[Subjectivism|subjective]] viewpoint, which he believed to be indicative of their mission as "prophets, <U+2026> men who criticize, who point out their society's plagues and who look on to a happier future, waiting for a savior".<ref>M<U+0103>ciuc<U+0103>, p.XXI<U+2013>XXII</ref> Through the latter ideal of moral regeneration, Heliade also complimented the Romantic stress on "national specificity", which he adopted in his later years.<ref>M<U+0103>ciuc<U+0103>, p.XXII<U+2013>XXIII</ref> At the same time, he centered much of his own literary work on non-original material, either by compiling it from various translations or by translating from a single source &mdash; having his focus on creating the basis for further development by introducing samples of untapped [[literary genre]]s and styles to [[Literature of Romania|Romanian literature]].<ref name="macxxiv">M<U+0103>ciuc<U+0103>, p.XXIV</ref>

While several of Heliade's contributions to literature have been considered to be of low importance,<ref>C<U+0103>linescu, p.65; M<U+0103>ciuc<U+0103>, p.XIV<U+2013>XXV; Zarifopol</ref> many others, above all his Romantic poem ''[[Zbur<U+0103>torul]]'', are hailed as major accomplishments.<ref>C<U+0103>linescu, p.67<U+2013>69; M<U+0103>ciuc<U+0103>, p.XV, XXX<U+2013>XXI</ref> ''Zbur<U+0103>torul'', borrowing from [[Romanian mythology]] its main character (the eponymous ''[[Incubus (demon)|incubus]]''-like being who visits nubile girls at night) also serves to depict the atmosphere of a Wallachian village from that period.<ref>C<U+0103>linescu, p.68<U+2013>69; M<U+0103>ciuc<U+0103>, p.XXX<U+2013>XXI; Zarifopol</ref> According to [[George C<U+0103>linescu]], the poem's value partly relies on its depiction of lust through the girls' eyes: "lacking the rages of [[Sappho]] and [[Phaedra (mythology)|Phaedra]]. The [[puberty]] crisis is explained through mythology and cured through [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]]".<ref>C<U+0103>linescu, p.68</ref>

An 1837 essay of his, centered on a debate regarding the translation of [[Homer]]'s works into Romanian, featured a series of counsels to younger writers: "This is not the time for criticism, children, it is the time for writing, so write as much and as good as you can, but without meanness; create, do not ruin; for the nation receives and blesses the maker and curses the destroyer. Write with a clear conscience".<ref>M<U+0103>ciuc<U+0103>, p.XXIII</ref> Paraphrased as "Write anything, boys, as long as you go on writing!" (''Scrie<U+0163>i, b<U+0103>ie<U+0163>i, orice, numai scrie<U+0163>i!''), this quote became the topic of derision in later decades, and was hailed as an example of Heliade's failure to distinguish between quality and quantity.<ref>Ibr<U+0103>ileanu, ''Amestec de curente<U+2026>''; M<U+0103>ciuc<U+0103>, p.XXIII</ref> The latter verdict was considered unfair by the literary historian [[<U+015E>erban Cioculescu]] and others, who argued that Ion Heliade R<U+0103>dulescu's main goal was to encourage the rapid development of local literature to a European level.<ref name="macxxiv"/> Although he recognized, among other things, Heliade's merits of having removed pretentious boyar discourse from poetry and having favored regular [[rhyme]], [[Paul Zarifopol]] accused him and [[Gheorghe Asachi]] of "tastelessness" and "literary insecurity".<ref name="zar"/> He elaborated: "R<U+0103>dulescu was arguably afflicted with this sin more than Asachi, given his unfortunate ambitions of fabricating a literary language".<ref name="zar">Zarifopol</ref>  

Heliade's name is closely connected with the establishment of [[Theatre of Romania|Romanian-language theater]], mirroring the activities of Asachi in [[Moldavia]].<ref name="curente"/><ref>M<U+0103>ciuc<U+0103>, p.XII</ref> Ever since he partook in creating ''So<U+0163>ietatea Filarmonic<U+0103>'' and the [[National Theatre Bucharest|Bucharest Theater]], to the moment of his death, he was involved in virtually all major developments in local dramatic and operatic art.<ref>M<U+0103>ciuc<U+0103>, p.XII<U+2013>XV</ref> In August 1834, he was one of the intellectuals who organized the first show hosted by ''So<U+0163>ietatea Filarmonic<U+0103>'', which featured, alongside a [[cavatina]] from [[Vincenzo Bellini]]'s ''[[Il pirata]]'', Heliade's translation of [[Voltaire]]'s ''[[Mahomet (play)|Mahomet]]''.<ref>M<U+0103>ciuc<U+0103>, p.XIII</ref> In subsequent years, members of the association carried out the translation of [[Theatre of France|French theater]] and other foreign pieces, while encouraging Romanian-language dramatists, an effort which was to become successful during and after the 1840s (when [[Constantin Aristia]] and [[Costache Caragiale]] entered their most creative periods).<ref>M<U+0103>ciuc<U+0103>, p.XIII<U+2013>XIV</ref> Heliade himself advocated [[didacticism]] in drama (defining it as "the preservation of social health"), and supported professionalism in [[acting]].<ref>Ion Massoff, in "Aprecieri critice", p.209<U+2013>210; M<U+0103>ciuc<U+0103>, p.XIV</ref>

Ion Heliade R<U+0103>dulescu made extensive use of the [[Romantic nationalism|Romantic nationalist]] focus on history, which he initially applied to his poetry.<ref>M<U+0103>ciuc<U+0103>, p.XXVI<U+2013>XXVIII</ref> In this instance as well, the goal was to educate his public; he wrote: "Nothing is worthy of derision as much as someone taking pride in his parents and ancestors and nothing more worthy of praise than when the ancestors' great deeds serve as a model and an impulse for competition among descendants".<ref>M<U+0103>ciuc<U+0103>, p.XXVII</ref> The main historical figure in his poetry is the late 16th century [[List of rulers of Wallachia|Wallachian Prince]] [[Michael the Brave]], the first one to rally Wallachia, Moldavia and [[Transylvania]] under a single rule: celebrated in Heliade's poem ''O noapte pe ruinele T<U+00E2>rgovi<U+015F>tii'' ("A Night on the Ruins of [[T<U+00E2>rgovi<U+015F>te]]"), he was to be the main character of a lengthy [[epic poem]], ''Mihaiada'', of which only two sections, written in very different styles, were ever completed (in 1845 and 1859 respectively).<ref>M<U+0103>ciuc<U+0103>, p.XXVIII</ref> Other historical poems also expanded on the ideal of a single Romanian state, while presenting the 1848 generation as a model for future Romanian politicians.<ref>M<U+0103>ciuc<U+0103>, p.XXIX</ref>

Throughout the 1860s, one of Heliade's main interests was an investigation into the issues involving Romanian history during the [[origin of the Romanians]] and the [[Romania in the Early Middle Ages|early medieval history]] of the [[Danubian Principalities]]. At a time when, in Moldavia, the newly-surfaced ''[[Chronicle of Huru]]'' traced a political lineage of the country to the [[Roman Empire]] through the means of a narrative which was later proven to be entirely fictional, Heliade made use of its theses to draw similar conclusions regarding Wallachia.<ref>Boia, p.48<U+2013>49</ref> His [[Conservatism|conservative]] views were thus expanded to the level of [[Historiography|historiographic]] thesis:<ref name="boia">Boia, p.43, 49</ref><ref>M<U+0103>ciuc<U+0103>, p.VIII</ref> according to Heliade, [[boyars]] had been an [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] and permeable class, which, from as early as the times of [[Radu Negru]], had adopted humane laws that announced and welcomed those of the [[French Revolution]] (he notably claimed that the [[Counties of Romania|county]]-based administration was a [[Democracy|democratic]] one, and that it had been copied from the [[Israelite]] model as depicted in the [[Bible]]).<ref name="boia"/>

The ideal he expressed in a work of the period, ''Equilibru <U+00EE>ntre antithesi'' ("A Balance between [[Antithesis|Antitheses]]") was moderate [[progressivism]], with the preservation of social peace.<ref>C<U+0103>linescu, p.67; M<U+0103>ciuc<U+0103>, p.VIII; Vianu, Vol.II, p.261<U+2013>272</ref> In [[Tudor Vianu]]'s view, partly based on earlier assessments by other critics, ''Equilibru'', with its stress on making political needs coincide with social ones through the means of counterweights, evidenced strong influences from [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]]'s thought, as well as vaguer ones from that of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]].<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.264<U+2013>272, 311</ref> Nonetheless, his system parted with [[Hegelianism]] in that, instead of seeking a balance between the ''[[Geist]]'' and existence, it considered the three states of human progress (''[[Thesis, antithesis, synthesis]]'') the reflection of a [[Numerology|mystical number]] favored throughout history.<ref name="calsixsix"/>  

In parallel, Heliade worked on a vast synthesis of his own [[philosophy of history]], based on his interpretation of [[Biblical theology]].<ref name="macxxiv">M<U+0103>ciuc<U+0103>, p.XXIV</ref> His 1858 work, ''Biblice'' ("Biblical Writings"), was supposed to form the first of four sections in a [[Christianity|Christian]] history of the world.<ref name="macxxiv"/> Referring to this project, C<U+0103>linescu defined Heliade's ideas as "interesting, no matter how na<U+00EF>ve at times, in general [[Voltaire|Voltairian]] and [[Freemasonry|Freemason]] [in shape]".<ref name="calsixsix"/> ''Biblicele'' partly evidenced Heliade's interests in the [[Talmud]] and ''[[Zohar]]''-like [[gematria]] &mdash; with emphasis placed on the numbers 3, 7, and 10 &mdash;, as well as ample reference to the ''[[Sephirot]]''.<ref name="calsixsix"/> One of his original thoughts on the matter was a reference to "[[Delta (letter)|deltas]]" (triangles) of [[Deity|deities]] &mdash; [[Elohim]]-[[Spirit]]-[[Matter]] and Spirit-Matter-the Universe.<ref name="calsixsix"/> A portion of Heliade R<U+0103>dulescu's poems also draw on religious themes and discourse. According to [[George C<U+0103>linescu]], the poet had attempted to create a parallel to both ''[[The Divine Comedy]]'' and the Bible, from [[Genesis]] to [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]], with a style influenced by Lamartine and [[Victor Hugo]].<ref>C<U+0103>linescu, p.67<U+2013>68</ref>

===Satire and polemics===
Heliade was aware of the often negative response to his work: in a poem dedicated to the memory of [[Friedrich Schiller]], he expanded on the contrast between creation and social setting (in reference to mankind, it stressed ''Te iart<U+0103> s<U+0103> faci r<U+0103>ul, iar binele nici mort'' <U+2014> "They forgive the evil committed against them, but never the good").<ref>M<U+0103>ciuc<U+0103>, p.XVI</ref> A noted author of [[satire]], he used it as a vehicle to criticize social customs of his day, as well as to publicize personal conflicts and resentments.<ref>M<U+0103>ciuc<U+0103>, p.XXIX<U+2013>XXXI</ref> As a maverick, he attacked political figures on both sides: conservatives who mimicked liberalism were the subject of his ''Areopagiul bestielor'' ("The [[Areopagus]] of the Beasts"), while many other of his post-1848 prose and poetry pieces mocked people on the [[Left-wing politics|left wing]] of liberalism, most notably [[C. A. Rosetti]] and his supporters.<ref>M<U+0103>ciuc<U+0103>, p.XXIX<U+2013>XXX, XXXIV</ref> During and after his exile, his conflicts with [[Cezar Bolliac]] and [[Ion Ghica]] also made the latter two the target of irony, most likely based on Heliade's belief that they intended to downplay his contributions to the [[Wallachian Revolution of 1848]].<ref>M<U+0103>ciuc<U+0103>, p.XXXIV</ref>

His autobiographical pieces, marked by acid comments on [[Greek language|Greek-language]] education, and, in this respect, similar to the writings of his friend [[Costache Negruzzi]], also display a dose of self-irony.<ref>M<U+0103>ciuc<U+0103>, p.XXXIV</ref> The enduring polemic with [[Grigore Alexandrescu]], as well as his quarrel with Bolliac, formed the basis of his [[pamphlet]] ''Domnul Sarsail<U+0103> autorul'' ("Mr. [[Devil in Christianity|Old Nick]], the Author"), an attack on what Heliade viewed as writers whose pretentions contrasted with their actual mediocrity.<ref>M<U+0103>ciuc<U+0103>, p.XXXII<U+2013>XXXIII</ref> In other short prose works, Ion Heliade R<U+0103>dulescu commented on the caricature-like nature of ''[[parvenu]]'' [[Bucharest]]ers (the male prototype, ''Coconul Dr<U+0103>gan'', was "an ennobled hoodlum", while the female one, ''Coconi<U+0163>a Dr<U+0103>gana'', always wished to be the first in line for the [[Anointing of the Sick|unction]]).<ref>M<U+0103>ciuc<U+0103>, p.XXXIII</ref> 

In various of his articles, he showed himself a critic of social trends. During the 1830s, he reacted against [[misogyny]], arguing in favor of [[women's rights]]: "Who has made man create himself unfair laws and customs, in order for him to cultivate his spirit and forsake [women] into ignorance<U+2026>?".<ref>{{ro icon}} Liliana Popescu, [http://www.unibuc.ro/eBooks/istorie/ciupala/conditiafemeii.htm "Condi<U+0163>ia femeii <U+00EE>n secolul XIX<U+2014><U+00EE>nceputul secolului XX"], in Alin Ciupal<U+0103>, [http://www.unibuc.ro/eBooks/istorie/ciupala/cuprins.htm ''Despre femei <U+015F>i istoria lor <U+00EE>n Rom<U+00E2>nia''], at the [[University of Bucharest]] site (retrieved [[June 9]], [[2007]])</ref> In 1859, after the [[History of the Jews in Romania|Jewish community]] in [[Gala<U+0163>i]] fell victim to a [[pogrom]], he spoke out against [[Antisemitism|Antisemitic]] [[Blood libel against Jews|blood libel]] accusations: "[[Jew]]s do not eat children in [[England]], nor do they in [[France]], nor do they in [[German Confederation|Germany]], nor do they do so wherever humans have become humans. Where else are they accused of such an inhumane deed? Wherever peoples are still [[Barbarian|Barbaric]] or semi-Barbaric".<ref>{{ro icon}} [[Andrei Oi<U+015F>teanu]], [http://www.contrafort.md/2003/100/501_2.html "Acuza<U+0163>ia de omor ritual (O sut<U+0103> de ani de la pogromul de la Chi<U+015F>in<U+0103>u)"], in ''Contrafort'', 2 (100), February 2003 (retrieved [[June 9]], [[2007]])</ref>

A large portion of Heliade's satirical works rely on mockery of speech patterns and physical traits: notable portraits resulting from this style include mimicking the manner of Transylvanian educators (with their strict adherence to [[Latin]] [[Etymology|etymologies]]), and his critique of the [[exophthalmos]] Rosetti (with eyes "more bulged than those of a giant frog").<ref name="cazimir">[[<U+015E>tefan Cazimir]], ''Caragiale: universul comic'', [[Editura pentru Literatur<U+0103>]], Bucharest, 1967, p.84-86. {{OCLC|7287882}}</ref><ref>C<U+0103>linescu, p.69; in "Aprecieri critice", p.211<U+2013>212</ref> Without sharing Heliade's views on literature, the younger [[Titu Maiorescu]] drew comparisons with his predecessor for launching into similar attacks, and usually in respect to the same rivals.<ref>Vianu, Vol.I, p.333, 399</ref>

==In cultural reference==
[[Image:The University.JPG|thumb|280px|Monument to Heliade R<U+0103>dulescu, opposite the [[University of Bucharest]] building]] 
A monument to Ion Heliade R<U+0103>dulescu, sculpted by the [[Italy|Italian]] artist [[Ettore Ferrari]], stands in front of the [[University of Bucharest|University]] building in central Bucharest. In addition to naming a lecture room after him, the [[Romanian Academy]] has instituted the ''Ion Heliade R<U+0103>dulescu Award'' &mdash; in 1880, it was awarded to [[Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu]], for his ''Cuvinte den b<U+0103>tr<U+00E2>ni'', and worth 5,000 gold [[Romanian leu|lei]].<ref>Paul Cornea, ''Studiu introductiv'', in [[Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu|B. P. Hasdeu]], ''Etymologicum magnum Romaniae'', Vol.I, [[Editura Minerva]], Bucharest, 1970, p.VII</ref> Ten years after, the prize was the center of a scandal, involving on one side the dramatist [[Ion Luca Caragiale]] and, on the other, the cultural establishment formed around members of the [[National Liberal Party (Romania)|National Liberal Party]], including Hasdeu and [[Dimitrie Sturdza]]. The latter disapproved of Caragiale's anti-Liberal stance and his association with ''[[Junimea]]'', as well as to his anti-[[nationalism]], dislike of [[didacticism]], and alleged [[cosmopolitanism]].<ref name="cioculescu">[[<U+015E>erban Cioculescu]], ''Caragialiana'', [[Editura Eminescu]], Bucharest, 1974, p.124<U+2013>125, 128<U+2013>132. {{OCLC|6890267}}</ref><ref name="vianuII182">Vianu, Vol. II, p.182</ref> They thus refused to grant him the prize.<ref name="cioculescu"/><ref name="vianuII182"/> 

A high school in his native [[T<U+00E2>rgovi<U+015F>te]] bears the name ''Ion Heliade R<U+0103>dulescu'', as does a village in the [[Commune in Romania|commune]] of [[Ziduri]], [[Buz<U+0103>u County]]. The grave of [[Take Ionescu]], an influential political figure and one-time [[Prime Minister of Romania]] who was Heliade's descendant, is situated in [[Sinaia Monastery]], in the immediate vicinity of a fir tree planted by Heliade and his fellow 1848 revolutionaries.<ref>{{ro icon}} Marius Dobrin, [http://www.respiro.org/Issue6/eseu_dobrin.htm "Take Ionescu<U+2014>un mare democrat, un mare european"], in ''Respiro'' (retrieved [[June 5]], [[2007]])</ref>

In his 1870 poem ''Epigonii'' ("The [[wiktionary:epigone|Epigone]]s"), [[Mihai Eminescu]] payed tribute to early Romanian-language writers and their contributions to literature. An entire [[stanza]] is dedicated to Heliade:

During the early 1880s, [[Alexandru Macedonski]] and his ''[[Literatorul]]'' attempted to preserve Heliade's status and his theories when these were faced with criticism from ''Junimea''; by 1885, this rivalry ended in defeat for Macedonski, and contributed to the disestablishment of ''Literatorul''.<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.362, 376</ref> 

Although a ''Junimist'' for a large part of his life, Ion Luca Caragiale himself saw a precursor in Heliade, and even expressed some sympathy for his political ideals. During the 1890s, he republished a piece by Heliade in the [[Conservative Party (Romania, 1880<U+2013>1918)|Conservative Party]]'s main journal, ''[[Epoca (Romania)|Epoca]]''.<ref name="cazimir"/> One of Caragiale's most significant characters, the Transylvanian schoolteacher [[Marius Chico<U+015F> Rostogan]], shares many traits with his counterparts in Heliade's stories.<ref name="cazimir"/> Developing his own theory, he claimed that there was a clear difference between, on one hand, the generation of Heliade R<U+0103>dulescu, [[Ion C<U+00E2>mpineanu]], and [[Nicolae B<U+0103>lcescu]], and, on the other, the National Liberal establishment formed around [[Pantazi Ghica]], [[Nicolae Misail]] and [[Mihail P<U+0103>t<U+00E2>rl<U+0103>geanu]] &mdash; he identified the latter grouping with [[hypocrisy]], [[demagogy]], and [[political corruption]], while arguing that the former could have found itself best represented by the Conservatives.<ref>[[Z. Ornea]], ''Junimea <U+015F>i junimismul'', Vol. II, Editura Minerva, Bucharest, 1998, p.202-204, 228. ISBN 973-21-0562-3</ref>

Comments about Heliade and his Bucharest statue feature prominently in Macedonski's short story ''Nicu Dereanu'', whose main character, a daydreaming [[Bohemianism|Bohemian]], idolizes the Wallachian writer.<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.429<U+2013>430</ref> ''[[Sbur<U+0103>torul]]'', a [[Modernism|modernist]] literary magazine of the [[interwar period]], edited by [[Eugen Lovinescu]], owed its name to ''[[Zbur<U+0103>torul]]'', making use of an antiquated variant of the name (a form favored by Heliade). During the same years, [[Camil Petrescu]] made reference to Heliade in his novel ''[[Un om <U+00EE>ntre oameni]]'', which depicts events from [[Nicolae B<U+0103>lcescu]]'s lifetime.<ref>Vianu, Vol.III, p.317</ref>

In his ''Autobiography'', the Romanian philosopher [[Mircea Eliade]] indicated that it was likely that his ancestors, whose original surname was ''Ieremia'', had adopted the new name as a tribute to Heliade R<U+0103>dulescu, whom they probably admired.<ref>[[Mircea Eliade]], ''Autobiography'', [[University of Chicago Press]], Chicago, 1990, p.4. ISBN 0226204073</ref>
