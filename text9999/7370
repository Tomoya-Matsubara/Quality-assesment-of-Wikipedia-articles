"'''The Climb'''" is a song performed by American recording artist and actress [[Miley Cyrus]], for the 2009 film ''[[Hannah Montana: The Movie]]''. The song was written by [[Jessi Alexander]] and Jon Mabe, and produced by [[John Shanks]]. It was released on March 12, 2009, as the [[lead single]] of the film's [[Hannah Montana: The Movie (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] by [[Walt Disney Records]]. The song is a [[power ballad]] with lyrics that describe life as a difficult but rewarding journey. It is styled as a [[country pop]] ballad, and was Cyrus' first solo song to be released to country radio. The [[Instrumentation (music)|instrumentation]] includes [[piano]], [[guitar]] and [[violin]]s.

"The Climb" was generally well received by critics and was nominated for the [[Grammy Award for Best Song Written for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media|Best Song Written for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media]] at the [[52nd Grammy Awards]]. However, the song was withdrawn from consideration by Walt Disney Records because it had not been written specifically for a movie as the category's eligibility rules required. The song achieved worldwide success and became a top ten hit on charts in Australia, Canada, Norway and the United States. In the United States, the song peaked at number four on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and became the eighth best selling digital single of 2009. Five months after its release, the single was certified [[music recording sales certifications|triple platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). Since, it has been recognized as one of the [[List of best-selling singles in the United States|best-selling singles in the United States]].

The song's accompanying [[music video]] was directed by [[Matthew Rolston]], and depicts scenes of Cyrus climbing a mountain or singing, intercut with clips of ''Hannah Montana: The Movie''. Cyrus promoted the song with several live performances. The first, at the [[First inauguration of Barack Obama#Kids' Inaugural: "We Are the Future"|Kids Inaugural: "We Are the Future"]] event on January 19, 2009, was the first time the song had ever been publicly heard. Cyrus also performed the song as the closing number of her [[Wonder World Tour (Miley Cyrus)|Wonder World Tour]]. The song was also performed during the [[Gypsy Heart Tour]]. "The Climb" has been [[Cover version|covered]] by several artists and was the most popular choice of song among auditioners for the [[American Idol (season 9)|ninth season]] of the American singing contest, ''[[American Idol]]'', with [[Hollie Cavanagh]] performing it in the top 6 of the [[American Idol (season 11)|eleventh season]]. [[Simon Cowell]], creator of the British television talent show ''[[The X Factor (UK)|The X Factor]]'', chose "The Climb" to be the debut single of the winner of the competition's [[The X Factor (UK Series 6)|sixth series]]. Winner [[Joe McElderry]]'s cover, released on December 14, 2009 by [[Syco Music]], was produced by [[Quiz & Larossi]] and topped the [[Irish Singles Chart]] and the [[UK Singles Chart]].

== Background ==
"The Climb" was not intentionally written for the 2009 [[musical film]] ''Hannah Montana: The Movie''. Co-writer Jessi Alexander conceived the song's melody while driving to the home of songwriting partner Jon Mabe. Once she arrived, she and Mabe developed a song about overcoming life's obstacles inspired by their personal struggles in the music industry.<ref name="MSNBC">{{cite web|url=http://www.thenewsroom.com/details/3767761|title=Songwriter Talks About Miley Cyrus Hit 'The Climb' |date=August 15, 2009|work=[[WSMV-TV]]|publisher=[[Voxant]]|accessdate=November 27, 2009}}</ref> Alexander referred to the process as a form of "therapy"<ref name="weekly" /> and recalled, {{quote|"I was just driving to work one day. It's just a typical day, nothing really special about that day. And I just had this melody in my head. And I couldn't get to my co-writer Jon Mabe or my guitar fast enough because I just wanted to play what I was hearing. And, you know, we just kinda put it down pretty fast and didn't really think anything about it. The lyrics kinda started to come, I think for both of us, being kinda underdogs in the business. My co-writer was a songplugger, just turned songwriter, and I'd had record deals and ups and downs in the music business. I think for both of us, we just came from a place of, you know, 'it's not a race'."<ref name="MSNBC" />}}
The song they created was titled "It's the Climb" and was written in [[Third-person narrative#Third-person view|third person]].<ref name="ewwriting">{{cite interview|url=http://music-mix.ew.com/2009/12/11/the-climb-writer-jessi-alexander-miley-cyrus-grammys/|title=Q&A with Miley Cyrus songwriter Jessi Alexander: 'The Climb' being pulled from Grammy noms is 'devastating'|date=December 11, 2009|first=Jessi|last=Alexander|subjectlink=Jessi Alexander|interviewer=Whitney Pastorek of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''|accessdate=December 18, 2009}}</ref> Alexander described the original song as "more [[Spiritual (music)|spiritual]]" than the version that was released, and said it contained lines about [[prayer]]. However, she claimed she knew it was pop and suitable for [[The Walt Disney Company]].<ref name="ewwriting" />

Before reaching Cyrus, the song had been rejected by several country artists. It was eventually picked up by [[Peter Chelsom]], director of ''Hannah Montana: The Movie'', who gave it to Cyrus to record for the film.<ref name="weekly">{{cite journal|last=Paxman|first=Bob|date=September 14, 2009|title=Climb Every Mountain|journal=[[Country Weekly]]|volume=16|issue=31|issn=1074-3235}}</ref> Chelsom found what would become "The Climb" while visiting [[Nashville, Tennessee]], during a quest to find eleven new songs for ''Hannah Montana: The Movie''.<ref name="ewwriting" /> After hearing Alexander's music, Chelsom asked her to submit songs for consideration. Alexander recorded "It's the Climb" on a CD and gave it to him. Several weeks later, Chelsom called to say that "the song was gonna be an integral part of the movie".<ref name="ewwriting" /> However, he wanted Mabe and Alexander to rework some of the song's content and to change the song from third person to [[First-person narrative|first person]].<ref name="ewwriting" /> Alexander felt the changes amounted to a "substantial amount of the song" and commented, "For me, when you change something from third person to first person, it can change the whole meaning of a line."<ref name="ewwriting" /> She and Mabe "wrestl[ed] over taking words out" and how much they could change while maintaining the song's integrity.<ref name="ewwriting" /> After a number of drafts, Mabe and Alexander finally created a version they felt was "perfect for the movie".<ref name="ewwriting" />

Upon receiving the final draft, filmmakers told the songwriters, "This is perfect for Miley, it<U+2019>s gonna change her life, gonna change your life."<ref name="ewwriting" /> Chelsom commented that the song "turned up" the film's music level by tapping into Cyrus's newfound vocal range.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=276454020&uo=4|title=UK Premiere <U+2013> Hannah Montana The Movie |work=[[iTunes Store]]|publisher=[[Apple, Inc]]|accessdate=November 11, 2009|time=1:14<U+2013>1:30}}</ref> As with the other songs featured in ''Hannah Montana: The Movie'', the song is "tightly woven into the fabric of the story and the characters".<ref name="prod">{{cite web|url=http://www.visualhollywood.com/movies_2009/hanna_montana/notes.pdf|title=Hannah Montana The Movie Production Notes|work=[[Walt Disney Pictures]]|publisher=VisualHollywood.com|accessdate=November 11, 2009}}</ref> In the film, Cyrus plays [[Miley Stewart]], a character with a secret double life as superstar [[Hannah Montana (character)|Hannah Montana]].

It's an epic [...] [[power ballad]] that encapsulates Miley's journey and the message of the film."<ref name="prod" />

"The Climb" was chosen as the lead single from the soundtrack due to its country elements, which introduced Cyrus to listeners beyond her usual pop audience.<ref name="ew" /> The song is Cyrus's first solo effort marketed directly to country radio, though she had previously recorded and released a country duet with her father, [[Billy Ray Cyrus]], which was titled "[[Ready, Set, Don't Go]]", in 2007.

Critical reception for the song was generally positive. Fraser McAlpine of the [[BBC]] felt the song's lyrics were generic, but complimented Cyrus vocals: "Miley acquits herself well vocally <U+2014> there are moments where her voice sounds a tad strained, but it's good to hear her on a track that's a little more subdued and with less frantic production than the uptempo, sassy pop songs we're used to."<ref name="bbclyr" /> Michael Menachem of ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine called the song "one of the year's strongest ballads".<ref name="billreview">{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/review/1070956/miley-cyrus-party-in-the-usa|title=Miley Cyrus, "Party in the U.S.A."|date=August 24, 2009|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=[[Nielsen Business Media, Inc]]|accessdate=November 16, 2009|last=Menachem|first=Michael}}</ref> Wesley Morris of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' praised "The Climb" for being a "pretty liberation anthem".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/movies/articles/2009/04/10/hannah_is_still_keeping_a_secret/|title=The screen is bigger, but 'Hannah' is still keeping a secret|work=[[The Boston Globe]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|accessdate=October 21, 2009|date=April 10, 2009|first=Wesley|last= Morris}}</ref> Leah Greenblatt of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' said, "On tunes like [...] 'The Climb', the 16-year-old [[Tennessee]] native turns up her homegrown inflections, but a few elongated r's won't exactly shut out her huge pop audience."<ref name="ew">{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20266411,00.html|title=Hannah Montana: The Movie (2009)|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Time Warner|Time Warner, Inc]]|first=Leah|last=Greenblatt|accessdate=October 9, 2009|date=March 18, 2009}}</ref> Todd Martens of ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'' believed that "The Climb" was "buried in cheese" and described it as "pre-[[Valentine's Day]] gooeyness".<ref name="LAtimes" /> However, Martens said, "'The Climb' is the rare Miley ballad that's on par with some of her more spunky teen pop."<ref name="LAtimes" />

He later expanded his review, calling it "a soulless rephrasing of an extremely famous philosophical message (so famous it borders on cliche) that doesn<U+2019>t provide an emotionally coherent context or justification". Milliken gave the song a higher grade because "she<U+2019>s a pretty good singer for someone her age".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.countryuniverse.net/2009/03/12/miley-cyrus-the-climb/|title=Miley Cyrus <U+2014> "The Climb"|last=Milliken|first=Dan|date=2009-03-12|work=Country Universe|accessdate=2009-03-26}}</ref>

== Music video ==
[[File:The Climb Miley Cyrus music video.jpg|right|thumb|230px|Alt=A brunette teen tilts her head upward and looks to the sky while clasping her hands at her chest and singing. She sits at the top of a red mountain cliff during sunset.|Cyrus portrayed singing at the top of the mountain in the music video to "The Climb". This setting is similar to that of the music video for "[[I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman]]" by [[Britney Spears]].]]
[[Matthew Rolston]] directed the music video for "The Climb",{{cn|date=February 2014}} which premiered on Cyrus's [[MySpace]] page on February 11, 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vids.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=vids.individual&VideoID=52165367|title=Miley Cyrus <U+2013> The Climb <U+2013> Official Music Video|work=[[Myspace]]|publisher=[[Fox Interactive Media]]}}</ref> The video commences with a shot of Cyrus holding a guitar and a suitcase as she begins to walk down a long path extending through a valley. At the end of the valley, the sun breaks out over a distant mountain. The entire scene is enhanced with [[computer-generated imagery]].<ref name="britney" /> Cyrus has her hair tied in a bun and wears a traveling jacket, a gray tank top and cowboy boots. In a separate setting, Cyrus, wearing a gray short sleeve shirt and her hair loose, begins to sing "The Climb" beneath a blue spotlight in a purple room. The two settings alternate throughout the video. A [[Vignetting|vignetted]] scene from ''Hannah Montana: The Movie'' appears in front of Cyrus as she walks on the path. The video zooms into the scene and a montage of film clips plays, featuring Cyrus's character and her love interest, Travis Brody (played by [[Lucas Till]]) horseback riding. The video returns to Cyrus walking; she picks up a rose fallen on the path, then throws it behind her. As the video progresses, she also sees things such as a herd of horses and a [[Meteoroid|shooting star]] cross her path.<ref name="LAtimes" /> A new setting enters the video in which Cyrus dances in a purple room with a [[countdown#Film|countdown]] or, occasionally, film clips projected on the wall behind her. Rain begins to pour in the path setting. Cyrus puts down her jacket, guitar case, suitcase and boots, and continues onwards with only her guitar strapped to her shoulder. More film clip montages play in the same manner as the first. As the last montage ends, Cyrus finally reaches the summit of a reddish, CGI mountain and triumphantly looks over the cliff's edge to watch the sun shining over a shimmering lake.<ref name="britney" /> An alternate version of the music video excluding the ''Hannah Montana: The Movie'' clips exists and was sent to several channels, including [[VH1]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/video/play.jhtml?artist=2408193&vid=348983|title=Miley Cyrus l The Climb|work=[[VH!]]|publisher=Vicaom|accessdate=November 17, 2009}}</ref>

Todd Martens of ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote that while he enjoyed the song, he was unsure about the video. He commented that while the video was an improvement since Cyrus's video for "[[7 Things]]" (2008), the settings in "The Climb" music video looked as though they had been painted by [[Thomas Kinkade]] and Cyrus's dancing appeared off-beat.<ref name="LAtimes" /> Travis of [[MTV]] described the video as "beautifully shot (although heavily digitized)".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://buzzworthy.mtv.com/2009/04/10/buzz-bites-%E2%80%94-41009-manic-miley-cyrus-movie-friday/|title=Manic Miley Cyrus Movie Friday!!!!!!|date=March 24, 2009|first=Travis|work=[[MTV]]|publisher=[[Viacom]]|accessdate=November 17, 2009}}</ref> Lyndsey Parker of [[Yahoo!

=== Background and composition ===
In the same year of "The Climb"'s original release, British executive [[Simon Cowell]] chose for [[Joe McElderry]], [[Olly Murs]], and [[Stacey Solomon]], the three finalists of the [[The X Factor (UK Series 6)|sixth series]] of the British television talent contest ''[[The X Factor (UK)|The X Factor]]'', to record the song in preparation for a single release as soon as the winner was announced.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mileycyrus.com/2009/12/03/simon-cowell-choses-the-climb-for-x-factor/|title=Simon Cowell choses 'The Climb' for X Factor|date=December 3, 2009|accessdate=December 3, 2009|work=MileyCyrus.com|publisher=[[Hollywood Records]]|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5lkyFayAs|archivedate=December 3, 2009}}</ref> After Solomon's elimination, Murs and McElderry sang the song on December 13, 2009, as their final performance in the competition. Upon winning the competition, McElderry's version of "The Climb", produced by [[Quiz & Larossi]], was released on December 14, 2009 by [[Syco Music]] as the first single from his album ''Wide Awake'' (2010).<ref name="dailymail">{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1235523/X-Factor-Favourite-Joe-McElderry-clinches-title.html|title=Joe McElderry wins The X Factor with 61% of the vote|first=Charlotte|last=Spratt|coauthors=Richard Simpson|work=[[The Daily Mail]]|publisher=[[Daily Mail and General Trust]]|date=December 14, 2009|accessdate=December 14, 2009|location=London}}</ref> McElderry said that the lyrics to "The Climb" meant a lot to him: "It's an emotional song because it's what's been happening in the last few months. It all feels very, very surreal."<ref name="dailymail" /> According to Peter Robinson of ''[[The Guardian]]'', the cover has a "plinky" [[piano]] in its [[introduction (music)|introduction]]. In regards to lyrics, Robinson interpreted, "lines about 'uphill battles' and 'having to lose' do seem to talk of Joe's probable future."<ref name="guardianreview">{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/musicblog/2009/dec/14/joe-mcelderry-the-climb-x-factor|work=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian Media Group|accessdate=March 30, 2010|title=Does The Climb lack the X Factor?|date=December 14, 2009|first=Peter|last=Robinson|location=London}}</ref>

=== Reception ===
Peter Robinson of ''[[The Guardian]]'' described "The Climb" as a "controversially uncontroversial choice" for a cover and continued, "While 'The Climb' might be a suitable choice for a winner's single, the fact that it's a cover of such a recent song means that it's still slightly odd."<ref name="guardianreview" />

On the week ending 26 December 2009, "The Climb" debuted at number two on the [[UK Singles Chart]]; its debut position was influenced by a [[Killing in the Name#2009 Christmas Number One campaign|campaign]] composed of [[Facebook]] group members, aimed at getting [[Rage Against the Machine]]'s "[[Killing in the Name]]" (1992) to the top position during Christmas week.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/266349/rage-against-the-machine-beats-x-factor-to-uk-xmas-no-1|title=Rage Against The Machine Beats 'X Factor' To U.K. Xmas No. 1|first=Paul|last=Sexton|date=December 21, 2009|work=Billboard|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc|accessdate=March 30, 2010}}</ref> In the following week, the song reached number one, becoming the final number one of the 2000s decade, where it maintained for a week.<ref name="ukelderry">{{cite web|url=http://www.chartstats.com/songinfo.php?id=34691|title=Chart Stats <U+2013> Joe McElderry <U+2013> The Climb|work=ChartStats.com|publisher=The Official Charts Company|accessdate=March 30, 2010}}</ref> The single was [[List of music recording sales certifications|certified platinum]] by the [[British Phonographic Industry]] (BPI) for shipments exceeding 600,000 copies.<ref name="bpi">{{cite web|url=http://www.bpi.co.uk/certifiedawards/search.aspx|title=BPI <U+2013> Certified Awards Search|work=BPI.co.uk|publisher=[[British Phonographic Industry]]|accessdate=January 2, 2010}}</ref>  The song has sold 807,000 copies in the UK as of December 2012.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/the-top-10-biggest-selling-x-factor-debut-singles-and-albums-revealed-1746/ |title=The Top 10 biggest selling X Factor debut singles and albums revealed! |last=Lane|first=Dan|date=20 December 2012|publisher=[[The Official Charts Company]]|accessdate=27 December 2012}}</ref>
