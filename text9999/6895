==Godiji Parshwanth Temple in Mumbai==

Among the images that bear the name Godiji Parshwanth, the best known is Godiji Parshvanath in the Pydhuni locality of Bombay.<ref>On seventh heaven in Pydhonie, Times Of India, Jun 21, 2003, http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/On-seventh-heaven-in-Pydhonie/articleshow/34209.cms</ref> It was established in beginning of the eighteenth century in the Fort area. The image is said to have been brought from Mirpur in [[Sirohi]] district in Rajasthan. The temple was moved in [[samvat]] 1859 (1803 CE) to Pydhuni locality because of a fire. The brick and wood structure was complete replaced by a three story marble structure in 1989.

For  several centuries, the temple at Goripur was a celebrated Jain [[tirtha]]. A account of its building is contained in "Gaudi Parshvanath Stavan" by Pritivimala, composed in Samvat 1650 and "Shri Gaudi Parshvanath Stavan" written by Nemavijaya in Samvat 1807.<ref>Bhanvarlal Nahta, Shri Gaudi Parchvanath Tirth, Muni Jinavijaya Abhinandan Granth, Ed. Dalsukh Malvania, Jinavijayaji Samman Samiti, Jaipur, 1971, p. 263-275</ref>

According to Muni Darshanvijaya,<ref>Jain Paramparano Itihas, Munishi Darshanvijaya, Jnanavijaya, Nyayavijaya, Charitra Smarak Granthamala, Ahmedabad, 1960, p. 739-743</ref> it was installed by Seth Godidas of Jhinjhuvad and was consecreted by Acharya [[Hemachandra]] at [[Patan, Gujarat|Patan]] in Samvat 1228. It was brought to Patan and was buried underground for safekeeping during a period of disturbance. It was rediscovered in Samvat 1432 (1375-6 AD)and was stored in the stable of the local ruler.

According to the old texts, a merchant Megha Sa from [[Nagarparkar]] acquired the image by paying 125 dramma or 500 pieces (taka) and brought to Nagarparkar, where it was formally reconsecreted by Acharya Merutunga Suri of [[Anchala]] [[Gachchha]]. Later, according to instructions he received in a dream, he settled a new town at Godipur and constructed a temple in samvat 1444, thus establishing the Godi Parshvanth Tirth. The construction was supervised by an architect from [[Sirohi]]. The shikhar of the temple was completed by his son Mahio.

The tirth became famous and was visited by the Jains from afar. 

It was visited by Stanley Napier Raikes in 1854.<ref>Stanley Napier Raikes, Memoir on the Thurr and Parkur districts of Sind, Education Society's Press, Byculla, 1859. p. 83, Appendix B,</ref> Raikes met local Jains to compile recent history and consulted a Jain Yati Goorjee Kuntvujajee at Bodhesar, who had manuscripts describing the history of the temple.

In AD 1716, the local chief Soda Sutojee moved the image from the temple to a fort. The image used to buried underground at a secret location for safekeeping, and used to be taken out time to time with great elebration.  Raikes write that thousands of monks and hundreds of thousands of ordinary people assembled for the fairs held in 1764, 1788, 1796, 1810, 1822 and 1824 for the idol<U+2019>s exhibition.<ref>Footloose: The lost idol of Gorecha <U+2014>Salman Rashid, Daily Times, Pakistan, June 27, 2008, http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2008%5C06%5C27%5Cstory_27-6-2008_pg3_5</ref> In AD 1832, the chief  Soda Poonjajee, who was the only person who knew the location of the image,  was captured by the ex-Ameers and died in captivity. The image was never seen again.

The temple was later damaged in the battle between Colonel Tyrwhitt and a local Sodha chief, who had taken shelter at the temple.

The temple was inspected the Archaeological Survey of India in 1879.<ref>Reports regarding the archaeological remains in Kurrachee, Hyderabad, and Shik<U+00E1>rpur collectorates, in Sindh, with plans of tombs, Volume 8 of Arch<U+00E6>ological Survey of Western India, Archaeological Survey of India, Govt. Central Press, 1879,  p. 29</ref> The report refers to it having been built in Samvat 1432.<ref>Essai de bibliographie Jaina: r<U+00E9>pertoire analytique et m<U+00E9>thodique des  relatifs au Jainisme, By Armand Albert Gu<U+00E9>rinot, E. Leroux, 1906</ref> An inscription of 1715 was noted mentioning repairs made.<ref>Revised lists of antiquarian remains in the Bombay Presidency: Government central press, 1897, James Burgess, Henry Cousens, p. 222</ref>

Jain Muni Vidyavijayaji visited Sindh in 1937.<ref>Mari Sindhyatra, Muni Vidyavijayaji, Shri Vijayavardhamanasuri Jain Granthmala, v. 53, 1943 AD, p. 13-15</ref> He notes that the temple was empty, and had decayed. A local Bhil served as a guard. At that time there were still many Jain families in towns near Nagarparkar. During india's partition in 1947, the Jains left and the temple became inaccesable to the Jain community.

'''Gori Temple Architecture''': The Gori temple was constructed in the classical medieval style. The main structure (mula prasad) with a shikhara is surrounded by 52 subsidiary shrines (devakulikas), just like the [[Dilwara_Temples#Vimal_Vasahi_Temple|Vimala Vasahi]] at [[Mt. Abu]]. It is termed Dvi-Saptati or Bavan Jinalaya by Nandalal Chunilal [[Somapura]] in the Sanskrit text JinaPrasad-Martanda.<ref>Shilpacharya Nandalal Chunilal Somapura, JinaPrasad-Martanda, Dakshkumar Nandalal  Somapura, Palitana, 1993, p. 343-345</ref> Like Vimala Vasahi,  each of the 52 shrines are topped with a low dome. There is a [[bhonyra]]  (underground chamber) like some of the old temples in North India.

The shrines are now empty. However the paintings in the 12-column ranga-[[mandap]] at the front gate are well preserved. An upper band shows people worshiping the Tirthankaras. Two of the bands below show processions with horses, elephants, planquins, chariots, indoor and outdoor scenes etc. and one of the bands has paintings of the Tirthankaras. Such paintings are now quite rare, since paintings of this period in India have generarally been painted over.

==Descendants of the builders==

According to traditional accounts, compiled in early 20th century by Yati Ramlal Gani,<ref>Mahajan-Vamsh-Muktavali, Upadhayay Shri Ramalaji Gani, Pub. Shisyakshem Amar Balchandra, Bikaner, 1921, p. 21-24</ref> the members of the Gothi clan of [[Oswal]]s are the descendants of Megha Sa. They now live in various part of India.<ref>Mangilal Bhutoria, Itihas Ki Amarbel Oswal, Priyadarshi Prakashn 1992, p. 226</ref>

There are many remains of Jain temples in [[Nagarparkar]] region. Several Oswal clans trace their descent from this region.
