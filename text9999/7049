'''7&nbsp;World Trade Center''' is a building in [[New York City]] located across from the [[World Trade Center site]] in [[Lower Manhattan]]. It is the second building to bear that name and address in that location. The original structure was completed in 1987 and fell after the Twin Towers collapsed in the [[September 11 attacks]]. The current 7&nbsp;World Trade Center opened in 2006 on part of the site of the old 7&nbsp;World Trade Center. Both buildings were developed by [[Larry Silverstein]], who holds a [[ground rent|ground lease]] for the site from the [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey]].

The original 7&nbsp;World Trade Center was 47&nbsp;stories tall, clad in red exterior masonry, and occupied a [[trapezoid]]al footprint. An elevated walkway connected the building to the [[World Trade Center]] plaza. The building was situated above a [[Consolidated Edison]] (Con Ed) power substation, which imposed unique structural design constraints. When the building opened in 1987, Silverstein had difficulties attracting tenants. In 1988, [[Salomon Brothers]] signed a long-term lease, and became the main tenants of the building. On September 11, 2001, 7&nbsp;WTC was damaged by debris when the nearby North Tower of the [[collapse of the World Trade Center|World Trade Center collapsed]]. The debris also ignited fires, which continued to burn throughout the afternoon on lower floors of the building. The building's internal fire suppression system lacked water pressure to fight the fires, and the building collapsed completely at 5:21:10&nbsp;pm.<ref name="fema-ch5"/> The collapse began when a critical internal column buckled and triggered structural failure throughout, which was first visible from the exterior with the crumbling of a rooftop penthouse structure at 5:20:33&nbsp;pm.

Construction of the new 7&nbsp;World Trade Center began in 2002 and was completed in 2006. The building is 49&nbsp;stories tall (plus one underground floor), making it the 28th-tallest in New York.<ref name=skyscraperCenter/> It is built on a smaller footprint than the original, allowing [[Greenwich Street, Manhattan|Greenwich Street]] to be restored from [[TriBeCa]] through the World Trade Center site and south to [[Battery Park]]. The new building is bounded by [[Greenwich Street (Manhattan)|Greenwich]], [[Vesey Street (Manhattan)|Vesey]], [[Washington Street (Manhattan)|Washington]], and Barclay streets. A small park across Greenwich Street occupies space that was part of the original building's footprint. The current 7&nbsp;World Trade Center's design emphasizes safety, with a [[reinforced concrete]] core, wider stairways, and thicker fireproofing of steel columns. It also incorporates numerous [[green design]] features. The building was the first commercial office building in New York City to receive the U.S. Green Building Council's [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] (LEED) certification, where it won a gold rating. It was also one of the first projects accepted to be part of the Council's Pilot Program for Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design <U+2013> Core and Shell Development (LEED-CS).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wtc.com/about/office-tower-7/office-tower-7-green|title=About the WTC|publisher=Wtc.com|accessdate=May 14, 2011|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110528045715/http://www.wtc.com/about/office-tower-7/office-tower-7-green|archivedate=28 May 2011 <!--DASHBot-->|deadurl=no}}</ref>

In June 1986, before construction was completed, Silverstein signed [[Drexel Burnham Lambert]] as a tenant to lease the entire 7&nbsp;World Trade Center building for $3&nbsp;billion over a term of 30&nbsp;years.<ref>
{{cite news|author=Scardino, Albert|title=A Realty Gambler's Big Coup|work=The New York Times|date=July 11, 1986}}</ref>
In December 1986, after the [[Ivan Boesky|Boesky]] [[insider trading|insider-trading]] scandal, Drexel Burnham Lambert canceled the lease, leaving Silverstein to find other tenants.<ref>

Spicer & Oppenheim agreed to lease 14&nbsp;percent of the space, but for more than a year, as [[Black Monday (1987)|Black Monday]] and other factors adversely affected the [[Lower Manhattan]] real estate market, Silverstein was unable to find tenants for the remaining space. By April 1988, Silverstein had lowered the rent and made other concessions.<ref>

In November 1988, [[Salomon Brothers]] withdrew from plans to build a large new complex at [[Columbus Circle]] in [[Midtown Manhattan|Midtown]] and agreed to a 20-year lease for the top 19 floors of 7&nbsp;World Trade Center.<ref>

Most of three existing floors were removed as tenants continued to occupy other floors, and more than 350&nbsp;tons (U.S.) of steel were added to construct three double-height trading floors. Nine diesel generators were installed on the 5th floor as part of a backup power station. "Essentially, Salomon is constructing a building within a building <U+2013> and it's an occupied building, which complicates the situation," said a district manager of [[Silverstein Properties]]. The unusual task was possible, said [[Larry Silverstein]], because it was designed to allow for "entire portions of floors to be removed without affecting the building's structural integrity, on the assumption that someone might need double-height floors."<ref name="Salomonsolution"/>

FEMA made preliminary findings that the collapse was not primarily caused by actual impact damage from the collapse of 1&nbsp;WTC and 2&nbsp;WTC but by fires on multiple stories ignited by debris from the other two towers that continued unabated due to lack of water for sprinklers or manual firefighting. The report did not reach conclusions about the cause of the collapse and called for further investigation.<ref name="NIST Advisory Committee Dec 2007"/>

But the lack of water to fight the fire was an important factor. The fires burned out of control during the afternoon, causing floor beams near column 79 to expand and push a key girder off its seat, triggering the floors to fail around column 79 on Floors 8 to 14. With a loss of lateral support across nine floors, column 79 buckled <U+2013> pulling the east penthouse and nearby columns down with it. With the buckling of these critical columns, the collapse then progressed east-to-west across the core, ultimately overloading the perimeter support, which buckled between Floors 7 and 17, causing the remaining portion of the building above to fall downward as a single unit. The fires, fueled by office contents, along with the lack of water, were the key reasons for the collapse.<ref name="ncstar1-a"/>

The NIST report found no evidence supporting [[World Trade Center controlled demolition conspiracy theories#7 World Trade Center|conspiracy theories]] that 7 World Trade Center was brought down by controlled demolition. Specifically, the window breakage pattern and blast sounds that would have resulted from the use of explosives were not observed.<ref name="ncstar1-a"/> The suggestion that an incendiary material such as [[thermite]] was used instead of explosives was considered unlikely by NIST because of observations of the fire and the building's structural response to the fire, and because it is unlikely the necessary quantity of material could have been planted without discovery.<ref name="nist-questions" />

The old 7 World Trade Center was the first tall building known to have collapsed primarily due to uncontrolled fires.<ref name="nist-questions" /> Based on its investigation, NIST reiterated several recommendations it had made in its earlier report on the collapse of the Twin Towers, and urged immediate action on a further recommendation: that fire resistance should be evaluated under the assumption that sprinklers are unavailable; and that the effects of thermal expansion on floor support systems be considered. Recognizing that current building codes are drawn to prevent loss of life rather than building collapse, the main point of NIST's recommendations was that buildings should not collapse from fire even if sprinklers are unavailable.<ref name="ncstar1-a"/>

Once construction of the power substation was complete in October 2003, work proceeded on building the office tower.
