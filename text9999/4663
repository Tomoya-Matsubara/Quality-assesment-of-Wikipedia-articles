The '''Invasion of Poland''', also known as the '''September Campaign''' or '''1939 Defensive War''' ([[Polish language|Polish]]: ''Kampania wrze<U+015B>niowa'' or ''Wojna obronna 1939 roku'') in [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] and the  '''Poland Campaign''' ([[German language|German]]: ''Polenfeldzug'') in Germany, was an invasion of Poland by [[Nazi Germany]], the [[Soviet Union]], and a small [[Slovak invasion of Poland|Slovak]] contingent that marked the start of [[World War II]]. The invasion began on 1 September 1939, one week after the signing of the [[Molotov<U+2013>Ribbentrop Pact]], and ended 6 October 1939 with Germany and the Soviet Union dividing and annexing the whole of Poland. 

The day after the [[Gleiwitz incident]], German forces invaded Poland from the north, south, and west. As the Germans advanced, Polish forces withdrew from their forward bases of operation close to the Polish-German border to more established lines of defence to the east. After the mid-September Polish defeat in the [[Battle of the Bzura]], the Germans gained an undisputed advantage. Polish forces then [[Plan West|withdrew to the southeast]] where they prepared for a long defence of the [[Romanian Bridgehead]] and awaited expected [[France|French]] and [[United Kingdom|British]] support and relief.<ref name="Baliszewski-MH">Baliszewski, ''Most honoru''</ref> 

The Soviet [[Red Army]]'s [[Soviet invasion of Poland (1939)|invasion]] of the [[Kresy]] on 17 September, in accordance with a secret protocol of the Molotov<U+2013>Ribbentrop Pact, rendered the Polish plan of defence obsolete.<ref name="WIF">{{cite book |title=A World in Flames: A Short History of the Second World War |last=Kitchen |first=Martin |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1990 |publisher=Longman |location= |isbn=0582034086 |page=74|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=0t-fAAAAMAAJ&q=%22The+joint+invasion+of+Poland+was+celebrated+with+a+parade+by+the+Wehrmacht+and+the+Red+Army+in+Brest+Litovsk%22&dq=%22The+joint+invasion+of+Poland+was+celebrated+with+a+parade+by+the+Wehrmacht+and+the+Red+Army+in+Brest+Litovsk%22&lr=&ei=N0_USde1H5SwMpL1zeQC&pgis=1 }}</ref> Facing a second front, the Polish government concluded the defence of the Romanian Bridgehead was no longer feasible and ordered an emergency evacuation of all troops to neutral [[Romania]]. <ref name="Sanford">{{Harv|Sanford|2005|pp=20<U+2013>24}}</ref> On October 6, following the Polish defeat at the [[Battle of Kock (1939)|Battle of Kock]], German and Soviet Union forces gained full control over Poland. The success of the invasion marked the end of the [[Second Polish Republic]], though Poland never formally surrendered.

On 8 October, Germany [[Polish areas annexed by Nazi Germany|directly annexed]] western Poland and the former [[Free City of Danzig]] and placed the remaining block of territory under administration of the newly established [[General Government]]. The Soviet Union immediately started a campaign of [[sovietization]] of the newly acquired areas. This included staged elections, the results of which were used to legitimize the Soviet Union's annexation of eastern Poland. In the aftermath of the invasion, a collective of underground [[Polish resistance movement in World War II|resistance organizations]] formed the [[Polish Underground State]] within the territory of the former Polish state. Many of the military exiles that managed to escape Poland subsequently joined the [[Polish Armed Forces in the West]], an armed force loyal to the [[Polish government in exile]].

==Prelude to the campaign==
{{Main|Causes of World War II}}
In [[1933]], the [[Nazi Party|National-Socialist German Workers' Party]], under their leader [[Adolf Hitler]], came to power in [[Germany]]. Germany sought to gain [[hegemony]] in Europe, and to take over Soviet Union territory, acquiring "Living Space" (''[[Lebensraum]]'') and expanding "Greater Germany" (''[[Gro<U+00DF>deutschland]]''), to be eventually surrounded by a ring of allied states, [[satellite state|satellite]] or [[puppet state]]s.<ref>Diemut Majer,, ''"Non-Germans" under the Third Reich: the Nazi judicial and administrative system in Germany and occupied Eastern Europe with special regard to occupied Poland, 1939-1945''JHU Press, 2003, ISBN 0801864933, [http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0801864933&id=w-IQu7nWQwQC&pg=PA188&lpg=PA187&dq=poland+mitteleuropa&sig=deyy3OAO9MCOhW58ErgMFcmVYCM Google Print, p. 188-189]</ref> As part of this long term policy, at first, Hitler pursued a [[policy]] of [[rapprochement]] with Poland, trying to improve [[German<U+2013>Polish relations]], culminating in the [[German<U+2013>Polish Non-Aggression Pact]] of 1934.<ref name=rothwell>Victor Rothwell, ''Origins of the Second World War'', Manchester University Press, 2001, ISBN 0719059585, [http://books.google.ca/books?ie=UTF-8&hl=en&vid=ISBN0719059585&id=JLlaN3e4IcsC&pg=PA92&lpg=PA92&dq=pilsudski+germany+war&prev=http://books.google.ca/books%3Fq%3Dpilsudski%2Bgermany%2Bwar&sig=7uR4Bt61X9-ru0vXdgwDGeBJMrM Google Print, p.92]</ref> Earlier, Hitler's foreign policy worked to weaken the [[France<U+2013>Poland relations|ties between Poland and France]], and to manoeuvre Poland into the [[Anti-Comintern Pact]], forming a cooperative front against the Soviet Union.<ref name=rothwell/><ref name=czoczer150>Andrew J.

In addition to Soviet territory, the National-Socialists were also interested in establishing a new border with Poland because the German [[exclave]] of [[East Prussia]] was separated from the rest of the Reich by the "[[Polish Corridor]]". The Corridor constituted land long disputed by Poland and Germany, and inhabited by both groups. [[Prussian partition|Taken by Prussia]] in the [[Partitions of Poland]] in 1772, the corridor was later acquired by Poland after the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. Many Germans also wanted to incorporate into Germany the [[Free City of Danzig]] (Gda<U+0144>sk), an important port city with a predominantly German population, also gained by Germany in the 18th century, and that was split off Germany after Versailles into a nominally independent entity. Hitler sought to reverse those territorial losses, and on many occasions made an appeal to German [[nationalism]], promising to "liberate" the [[German minority in Poland|German minority]] still in the Corridor, as well as Danzig.<ref name=llsjdm88>Louis Leo Snyder, John D Montgomery, ''The new nationalism'', Transaction Publishers, 2003, ISBN 0765805502, [http://books.google.ca/books?id=F9PLkQTwOJIC&pg=PA88&dq=%22Polish+Corridor%22+nationalism&lr=&as_brr=3 Google Print, p.88]</ref>

Poland participated in the [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|partition of Czechoslovakia]] that followed the [[Munich Agreement]], although they were not part of the agreement. It coerced Czechoslovakia to surrender the city of [[<U+010C>esk<U+00FD> T<U+011B><U+0161><U+00ED>n]] by issuing an ultimatum to that effect on 30 September 1938, which was accepted by Czechoslovakia on 1 October.<ref>Nowa Encyklopedia Powszechna PWN 1997, vol. VI, 981.</ref>

In 1938, Germany began to increase its demands for Danzig, while proposing that a roadway be built in order to connect East Prussia with Germany proper, running through the Polish Corridor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.euronet.nl/~jlemmens/autobahn.html |title=Elbing-K<U+00F6>nigsberg Autobahn |publisher=Euronet.nl |date= |accessdate=2009-01-11}}</ref> Poland rejected this proposal, fearing that after accepting these demands, it would become increasingly subject to the will of Germany and eventually lose its independence as the Czechs had.<ref name="lawweb1">{{cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/subject_menus/ylbkmenu.asp |title=The Avalon Project : Documents in Law, History and Diplomacy |publisher=Yale.edu |date= |accessdate=2009-01-11}}</ref> The Poles also distrusted Hitler and his intentions.<ref name="lawweb1"/> At the same time, Germany's collaboration with anti-Polish Ukrainian nationalists from the [[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists]], which was seen as an effort to isolate and weaken Poland, further weakened German credibility in Polish eyes. The British were also aware of this. On 31 March, Poland was backed by a guarantee from [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[France]], though neither country was willing to pledge military support in Poland's defence. British [[Prime Minister]] [[Neville Chamberlain]] and his [[Foreign Secretary]], [[Edward Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]], still hoped to strike a deal with Hitler regarding Danzig (and possibly the Polish Corridor), and Hitler hoped for the same. Chamberlain and his supporters believed war could be avoided and hoped Germany would agree to leave the rest of Poland alone. German hegemony over Central Europe was also at stake.

Behind him stand German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop and Soviet Premier Joseph Stalin.]]
With tensions mounting, Germany turned to aggressive diplomacy. On 28 April 1939, it unilaterally withdrew from both the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact of 1934 and the [[London Naval Agreement]] of 1935. In early 1939, Hitler had already issued orders to prepare for a possible "solution of the Polish problem by military means." Another crucial step towards war was the surprise signing of the [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]] on 23 August, the denouement of secret Nazi-Soviet talks held in [[Moscow]], which capitalized on France and Britain's own failure to secure an alliance with the Soviet Union. As a result, Germany neutralized the possibility of Soviet opposition to a campaign against Poland. In a secret protocol of this pact, the Germans and the Soviets agreed to divide Eastern Europe, including Poland, into two spheres of influence; the western third of the country was to go to Germany and the eastern two-thirds to the Soviet Union.

The German assault was originally scheduled to begin at 04:00 on 26 August. However, on 25 August the [[Polish-British Common Defence Pact]] was signed as an annex to the [[Franco-Polish Military Alliance]]. In this accord, Britain committed itself to the defence of Poland, guaranteeing to preserve Polish independence. At the same time, the British and the Poles were hinting to Berlin that they were willing to resume discussions <U+2013> not at all how Hitler hoped to frame the conflict. Thus, he wavered and postponed his attack until 1 September managing to halt the entire invasion "in mid-leap", with the exception of a few units that were out of communication, towards the south (the Nazi press announced that fanatical Slovakians were behind a cross border raid).

[[Image:Ribbentrop-Molotov.svg|thumb|left|Planned and actual divisions of Poland, according to the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, with later adjustments|alt=Map showing the planned and actual divisions of Poland according to the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact.]]
On 26 August Hitler tried to dissuade the British and the French from interfering in the upcoming conflict, even pledging that the [[Wehrmacht]] forces would be made available to Britain's empire in the future.<ref>[http://www.fdrlibrary.marist.edu/psf/box31/t295s04.html Text version] see also the [http://www.fdrlibrary.marist.edu/psf/box31/a295s04.html original document] </ref> In any case, the negotiations convinced Hitler that there was little chance the Western Allies would declare war on Germany, and even if they did, because of the lack of ''territorial guarantees'' to Poland, they would be willing to negotiate a compromise favourable to Germany after its conquest of Poland. Meanwhile, the number of increased overflights by high-altitude [[reconnaissance aircraft]] and cross border troop movements signalled that war was imminent.

On 29 August prompted by the British, Germany issued one last diplomatic offer, with [[Fall Weiss (1939)|''Case White'']] yet to be rescheduled. At midnight on 29 August German Foreign Minister [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]] handed British Ambassador Sir Neville Henderson the list of terms which would allegedly ensure peace in regards to Poland. Danzig was to be returned to Germany ([[Gdynia]] would remain with Poland), and there was to be a plebiscite in the Polish Corridor, based on residency in 1919, within the year.<ref>''Documents Concerning the Last Phase of the German-Polish Crisis'', Proposal for a settlement of the Danzig and the Polish Corridor Problem as well as of the question concerning the German and Polish Minorities (New York: German Library of Information), p 33<U+2013>35.

On 30 August the [[Polish Navy]] sent its destroyer [[flotilla]] to Britain, executing [[Operation Peking]]. On the same day, [[Marshal of Poland]] [[Edward Rydz-<U+015A>mig<U+0142>y]] announced the [[mobilization]] of Polish troops. However, he was pressured into revoking the order by the French, who apparently still hoped for a diplomatic settlement, failing to realize that the Germans were fully mobilized and concentrated at the Polish border.<ref>Seidner, Stanley S.

Because of the prior stoppage, Poland managed to mobilize only 70% of its planned forces, and many units were still forming or moving to their designated frontline positions.

==Opposing forces==

Poland was attacked by German, Slovak and Russian forces.

===Germany===
Germany had a substantial numerical advantage over Poland and had developed a significant military prior to the conflict. The ''[[German Army|Heer]]'' (army) had some 2,400 [[tank]]s organized into six [[panzer]] divisions, utilizing a new [[operational doctrine]]. It held that these divisions should act in coordination with other elements of the military, punching holes in the enemy line and isolating selected units, which would be [[Encirclement|encircled]] and destroyed. This would be followed up by less-mobile mechanized infantry and foot soldiers. The ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' (air force) provided both tactical and strategic [[air power]], particularly [[dive bomber]]s that disrupted lines of supply and communications. Together, the so-called "new" methods, were nicknamed "''[[Blitzkrieg]]''" (lightning war). Historians [[Basil Liddell Hart]] claimed "Poland was a full demonstration of the Blitzkrieg theory."<ref>B.H.Hart & A.J.P Taylor, p41</ref> [[#Myths|Other historians, however, disagree]].<ref name=Cooper/>

[[Aircraft]] played a major role in the campaign. [[Bomber aircraft|Bombers]] also attacked cities, causing huge losses amongst the civilian population through [[terror bombing]]. The ''Luftwaffe'' forces consisted of 1,180 fighter aircraft: 290 [[Junkers Ju 87|Ju 87 Stuka]] dive bombers, 1,100 conventional bombers (mainly [[He 111]]s and [[Dornier Do 17]]s), and an assortment of 550 transport and 350 reconnaissance aircraft.<ref>Bombers of the Luftwaffe, Joachim Dressel and Manfred Griehl, Arms and Armour, 1994</ref><ref>The Flying pencil, Heinz J. Nowarra, Schiffer Publishing,1990,p25</ref> In total, Germany had close to 4,000 aircraft, all up to modern standards. A force of 2,315 aircraft were assigned to ''Weiss''.<ref>A History of World War Two, A.J.P Taylor, OCTOPUS, 1974, p35</ref> Due to its prior participation in the [[Spanish Civil War]], the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' was probably the most experienced, best trained and best equipped air force in the world in 1939.<ref>Seidner,''Marshal Edward <U+015A>mig<U+0142>y-Rydz Rydz and the Defense of Poland'',162</ref>

=== Poland ===
[[Image:Polish infantry marching -2 1939.jpg|thumb|upright|Polish Infantry|alt=Photo of a column of troops marching]]
Between 1936 and 1939, Poland invested heavily in the [[Centralny Okr<U+0119>g Przemys<U+0142>owy|Central Industrial Region]]. Preparations for a defensive war with Germany were ongoing for many years, but most plans assumed fighting would not begin before 1942. To raise funds for industrial development, Poland sold much of the modern equipment it produced.<ref> Seidner, ''Marshal Edward <U+015A>mig<U+0142>y-Rydz Rydz and the Defense of Poland'', 177</ref> In 1936, a [[Fundusz Obrony Narodowej|National Defence Fund]] was set up to collect funds necessary for strengthening the Polish Armed forces. The [[Polish Army]] had approximately a million soldiers, but less than half of them were mobilized by 1 September. Latecomers sustained significant casualties when public transport became targets of the ''Luftwaffe''. The Polish military had fewer armoured forces than the Germans, and these units, dispersed within the infantry, were unable to effectively engage the enemy.<ref>Seidner,''Marshal Edward <U+015A>mig<U+0142>y-Rydz Rydz and the Defense of Poland'', pages 270<U+2013>94</ref>
 
Experiences in the [[Polish-Soviet War]] shaped Polish Army organizational and operational doctrine. Unlike the [[trench warfare]] of the [[First World War]], the Polish-Soviet War was a conflict in which the [[cavalry]]'s mobility played a decisive role. .<ref>Seidner,''Marshal Edward <U+015A>mig<U+0142>y-Rydz Rydz and the Defense of Poland'', pages 135<U+2013>138</ref> Poland acknowledged the benefits of mobility but was unable to invest heavily in many of the expensive, unproven inventions since then. In spite of this, [[Polish cavalry]] [[brigade]]s were used as a mobile [[mounted infantry]] and had some successes against both German infantry and cavalry.<ref>Seidner,''Marshal Edward <U+015A>mig<U+0142>y-Rydz Rydz and the Defense of Poland'',158</ref>

The [[Polish Air Force]] (''Lotnictwo Wojskowe'') was at a severe disadvantage against the German ''Luftwaffe'', although it was ''not'' destroyed on the ground early on, as is commonly believed. The Polish Air Force lacked modern [[fighter aircraft]], but its pilots were among the world's best trained, as proven a year later in the [[Battle of Britain]], in which the Poles played a major part.<ref name="Peszke">[[Michael Alfred Peszke]], ''Polish Underground Army, the Western Allies, and the Failure of Strategic Unity in World War II'', McFarland & Company, 2004, ISBN 0-7864-2009-X, [http://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&vid=ISBN078642009X&id=zhb2doihL1wC&pg=PA2&lpg=PA2&dq=Polish+pilots+highly+trained&sig=yWoszV8u_z1PsQrdQLkkL5TknZo Google Print, p.2]</ref>

Overall, the Germans enjoyed numerical and qualitative aircraft superiority. Poland had only about 600 modern aircraft. The Polish Air Force had roughly 185 [[PZL P.11]] and some 95 [[PZL P.7]] [[fighter aircraft|fighters]], 175 [[PZL.23 Kara<U+015B>]] B, 35 Kara<U+015B> A, and by September, over 100 [[PZL.37 <U+0141>o<U+015B>]] were produced.{{#tag:ref|P-11c (+43 reserve), 30 P-7 (+85 reserve), 118 P-23 Kara<U+015B> light bombers, 36 P-37 <U+0141>o<U+015B> bombers (armed in line, additionally a few of the total number produced were used in combat), 84 reconnaissance RXIII Lublin, RWD14 Czapla (+115 reserve)<ref>Adam Kurowski 'Lotnictwo Polskie 1939' 129</ref>|group="Note"}} There were also over a thousand obsolete transport, [[reconnaissance]] and training aircraft. However, for the September Campaign, only some 70% of those aircraft were mobilized. Only 36 [[PZL.37 <U+0141>o<U+015B>]] [[bomber]]s were deployed. All those aircraft were of indigenous Polish design, with the bombers being more modern than fighters, according to the [[Ludomi<U+0142> Rayski]] air force expansion plan, which relied on a strong bomber force. The Polish fighters were a generation older than their German counterparts. The Polish PZL P.11 fighter, produced in the early 1930s, was capable of only 365&nbsp;km/h (approximately 220&nbsp;mi/h), far less than German bombers; to compensate, the pilots relied on its manoeuvrability and high diving speed.<ref>Seidner,''Marshal Edward <U+015A>mig<U+0142>y-Rydz Rydz and the Defense of Poland'',162<U+2013>63</ref> 

[[Image:7TP.jpg|thumb|right|thumb|Polish [[7TP]] light tank|alt=A Polish 7TP light tank]]
The tank force consisted of two armoured brigades, four independent tank battalions and some 30 companies of [[TKS]] tankettes attached to infantry divisions and cavalry brigades.
<ref>Seidner,''Marshal Edward <U+015A>mig<U+0142>y-Rydz Rydz and the Defense of Poland'', pages 122<U+2013>123</ref> A standard tank of the Polish Army during the Polish Defensive War of 1939 was [[7TP|7TP light tank]]. It was the first tank in the world with diesel engine and [[Vickers Tank Periscope MK.IV|360-degree Gundlach periscope]].<ref>7TP vol.II,Janusz Magnuski, Militaria 317,Warszawa 2009.</ref>. 7TP was significantly better armed than its most common opponents, the German [[Panzer I]] and [[Panzer II]] but only 140 tanks were produced between 1935 and the outbreak of the war. Poland had also a few relatively modern imported designs, such as 50 [[Renault R35]] tanks and 38 [[Vickers E]] tanks.

The [[Polish Navy]] was a small fleet of [[destroyer]]s, [[submarine]]s and smaller support vessels. Most Polish surface units followed [[Peking Plan|Operation Peking]], leaving Polish ports on 20 August and escaping by way of the [[North Sea]] to join with the British [[Royal Navy]]. Submarine forces participated in [[Operation Worek]], with the goal of engaging and damaging German shipping in the [[Baltic Sea]], but they had much less success. In addition, many [[Ship transport|merchant marine]] ships joined the British merchant fleet and took part in wartime [[convoy]]s.

===German plan===
[[Image:Poland1939 GermanPlanMap.jpg|thumb|250px|Dispositions of the opposing forces on 31 August 1939 with the German plan of attack overlayed.|alt=A Map showing the dispositions of the opposing forces on 31 August 1939 with the German plan of attack overlayed.]]
The [[Fall Weiss (1939)|German plan]] for what became known as the September Campaign was devised by General [[Franz Halder]], [[Chief of the General Staff (Germany)|chief of the general staff]], and directed by General [[Walther von Brauchitsch]], the [[commander in chief]] of the upcoming campaign. It called for the start of hostilities before a [[declaration of war]], and pursued a doctrine of mass encirclement and destruction of enemy forces. The infantry <U+2013> far from completely mechanized but fitted with fast moving artillery and logistic support <U+2013> was to be supported by [[Panzer|German tanks]] and small numbers of truck-mounted infantry (the Sch<U+00FC>tzen regiments, forerunners of the [[panzergrenadier]]s) to assist the rapid movement of troops and concentrate on [[Schwerpunkt|localized parts]] of the enemy [[Military front|front]], eventually isolating segments of the enemy, surrounding, and destroying them. The pre-war ''armored idea'' (which an American journalist in 1939 dubbed [[Blitzkrieg]]), which was advocated by some generals, including [[Heinz Guderian]], would have had the armor punching holes in the enemy's front and ranging deep into rear areas, but in actuality, the campaign in Poland would be fought along more traditional lines. This stemmed from conservatism on the part of the German high command, who mainly restricted the role of armor and mechanized forces to supporting the conventional infantry divisions.

Poland's terrain was well suited for mobile operations when the weather cooperated <U+2013> the country had flat [[plain]]s with long frontiers totalling almost 5,600 kilometres (3,500&nbsp;mi), Poland's long border with Germany on the west and north (facing [[East Prussia]]) extended 2,000 kilometres (1,250&nbsp;mi). Those had been lengthened by another 300 kilometres (180&nbsp;mi) on the southern side in the aftermath of the Munich Agreement of 1938; the German incorporation of [[Bohemia and Moravia]] and creation of the German [[puppet state]] of [[History of Slovakia#World War II|Slovakia]] meant that Poland's southern flank was exposed.

German planners intended to fully exploit their long border with the great enveloping manoeuvre of Fall Weiss. German units were to invade Poland from three directions:
* A main attack over the western Polish border. This was to be carried out by Army Group South commanded by General [[Gerd von Rundstedt]], attacking from German [[Silesia]] and from the [[Moravia]]n and Slovak border: General [[Johannes Blaskowitz]]'s 8th Army was to drive eastward against [[<U+0141><U+00F3>d<U+017A>]]; General [[Wilhelm List]]'s 14th Army was to push on toward [[Krak<U+00F3>w]] and to turn the Poles' [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathian]] flank; and General [[Walter von Reichenau]]'s 10th Army, in the centre with Army Group South's armour, was to deliver the decisive blow with a northeastward thrust into the heart of Poland.
* A second route of attack from northern [[Prussia]]. General [[Fedor von Bock]] commanded Army Group North, comprising General [[Georg von K<U+00FC>chler]]'s 3rd Army, which was to strike southward from East Prussia, and General [[G<U+00FC>nther von Kluge]]'s 4th Army, which was to attack eastward across the base of the [[Polish Corridor]].
* A tertiary attack by part of Army Group South's allied [[Slovak Republic (WWII)|Slovak]] units from Slovakia.
* From within Poland, the German minority would assist by engaging in diversion and sabotage operations through ''[[Selbstschutz]]'' units prepared before the war.

All three assaults were to converge on [[Warsaw]], while the main Polish army was to be [[Encirclement|encircled]] and destroyed west of the [[Vistula]]. Fall Weiss was initiated on 1 September 1939, and was the first operation of the Second World War in Europe.

=== Polish defence plan===
[[Image:Dywizje wrzesien 1.png|thumb|right|Deployment of German and Polish divisions immediately before the German invasion.|alt=Map showing deployment of German and Polish divisions on 1 September 1939, immediately before the German invasion.]]
The Polish political determination to deploy forces directly at the German-Polish border, based on the British Government's promise to come to Poland's aid in the event of invasion, shaped the country's defence plan, ''[[Plan West]]''. Poland's most valuable natural resources, industry and population were located along the western border in [[Autonomous Silesian Voivodship|Eastern Upper Silesia]]. Polish policy centred on their protection especially since many politicians feared that if Poland were to retreat from the regions disputed by Germany, Britain and France would sign a separate peace treaty with Germany similar to the [[Munich Agreement]] of 1938.<ref>Seidner,''Marshal Edward <U+015A>mig<U+0142>y-Rydz Rydz and the Defense of Poland'',68<U+2013>72</ref> The fact that none of Poland's allies had specifically guaranteed Polish borders or [[territorial integrity]] certainly did not help in easing Polish concerns. For these reasons, Poland disregarded French advice to deploy the bulk of their forces behind the natural barriers such as the [[Vistula]] and [[San (river)|San]] rivers, even though some Polish generals supported it as a better strategy. The West Plan did permit the Polish armies to retreat inside the country, but it was supposed to be a slow retreat behind prepared positions and was intended to give the armed forces time to complete its mobilization and execute a a general [[counteroffensive]] with the support of the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]].<ref>Seidner,''Marshal Edward <U+015A>mig<U+0142>y-Rydz Rydz and the Defense of Poland'',122<U+2013>25</ref>

The British and French estimated that Poland should be able to defend itself for two to three months, while Poland estimated it could do so for at least six months. Poland drafted its estimates based upon the expectation that the Western Allies honor their treaty obligations and quickly start an offensive of their own. In addition, the French and British expected the war to develop into [[trench warfare]] much like World War I. The Polish government was not notified of this strategy and based all of its defence plans on promises of quick relief by their Western allies.<ref name="Pi<U+0105>tkowski">{{pl icon}} {{cite book | author =Henryk Pi<U+0105>tkowski | title =Kampania wrze<U+015B>niowa 1939 roku w Polsce | year =1943 |  page =39 | publisher =Sekcja Wydawnicza APW | location =Jerusalem | url =http://homepages.ihug.co.nz/~antora/WYDAW/KAMPANIA/tekst/KAMPANIA1.HTM }}</ref><ref name="Raczy<U+0144>ski">{{cite book | author =Count [[Edward Raczy<U+0144>ski (1891-1993)|Edward Raczy<U+0144>ski]] | title =The British-Polish Alliance; Its Origin and Meaning | year =1948 | publisher =Mellville Press | location = London }}</ref>  

Polish forces were stretched thinly along the Polish-German border and lacked compact defence lines and good defence positions along disadvantageous terrain.  This strategy also left [[supply line]]s poorly protected. Approximately one-third of Poland's forces were concentrated in or near the [[Polish Corridor]], leaving them perilously exposed to a [[Pincer movement|double envelopment]] from East Prussia and the west. Another third were massed in the north-central part of the country, between the major cities of [[<U+0141><U+00F3>d<U+017A>]] and Warsaw.<ref>Seidner,''Marshal Edward <U+015A>mig<U+0142>y-Rydz Rydz and the Defense of Poland'',304<U+2013>310</ref> The Poles' forward concentration largely forfeited their chance of fighting a series of delaying actions since their army, unlike some of Germany's, traveled largely on foot and lacked the ability to retreat to their defensive positions before being overrun by German mechanized formations.<ref name="ReferenceA">Seidner,''Marshal Edward <U+015A>mig<U+0142>y-Rydz Rydz and the Defense of Poland'',312</ref>

[[Image:Peking.jpg|thumb|[[Peking Plan]]: Polish destroyers evacuate the Baltic Sea on route to the United Kingdom.|alt=Photo of three Polish destroyers executing the Peking Plan and evacuating to British before the start of the invasion.]] 
As the prospect of conflict increased, the British government pressed Marshal Edward Rydz-<U+015A>mig<U+0142>y, to evacuate the most modern elements of the [[Polish Navy]] from the Baltic Sea.<ref name="PN">{{cite book | last = Peszke | first = Michael Alfred | authorlink = Michael Alfred Peszke  | title = Poland's Navy, 1918-1945 | publisher = [[Hippocrene Books]] | date = February 1999  | isbn = 0781806720| page = 37}}</ref> In the event of war the Polish military leaders realized that the ships which remained in the Baltic were likely to be quickly sunk by the Germans. Furthermore, the [[Danish straits]] were well within operating range of the German [[Kriegsmarine]] and [[Luftwaffe]], so there was little chance of an evacuation plan succeeding if implemented after hostilities began. Four days after the signing of the [[Polish-British Common Defence Pact]], three destroyers of the Polish Navy executed the [[Peking Plan]] and consequently evacuate to Great Britain.<ref name="PN"/>

Although the Polish military had prepared for conflict, the civilian population remained largely unprepared. Polish pre-war [[propaganda]] emphasized that that any German invasion would be easily repelled. Consequently, Polish defeats during the German invasion came as a shock to the civilian population, who were largely unprepared.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Lacking training for such a disaster the civilian population panicked and retreated east, spreading chaos, lowering troop morale and making road transportation for Polish troops very difficult.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

===Phase 1: German invasion===
[[Image:Poland2.jpg|thumb|250px|Map showing the advance made by the Germans, and the disposition of all troops on 14 September|alt=Map showing the advance made by the Germans, and the disposition of German and Polish troops on 14 September 1939.]]
Following several German-staged incidents ([[Gleiwitz incident|Operation Himmler]]), which German propaganda used as an excuse to claim that German forces were acting in [[self-defense|self-defence]], the first regular act of war took place on 1 September 1939, at 04:40, when the German Air Force (''Luftwaffe'') [[Bombing of Wielu<U+0144>|attacked the Polish town of Wielu<U+0144>]], destroying 75% of the city and killing close to 1,200 people, most of them civilians. This invasion subsequently began the [[Second World War]]. Five minutes later, the old German [[battleship]] [[German battleship Schleswig-Holstein|''Schleswig-Holstein'']] opened fire on the Polish military transit depot at [[Battle of Westerplatte|Westerplatte]] in the [[Free City of Danzig]] on the [[Baltic Sea]]. At 08:00, German troops, still without a formal declaration of war issued, [[Battle of Mokra|attacked near the Polish town of Mokra]]. The [[Battle of the Border]] had begun. Later that day, the Germans attacked on Poland's western, southern and northern borders, while German aircraft began raids on Polish cities. The main axes of attack led eastwards from Germany proper through the western Polish border. Supporting attacks came from [[East Prussia]] in the north, and a co-operative German-[[Slovak Republic (WWII)|Slovak]] tertiary attack by units (Army "Bernolak") from German-allied [[Slovak Republic (WWII)|Slovakia]] in the south. All three assaults converged on the Polish capital of Warsaw.

The Allied governments declared war on Germany on 3 September; however, they [[Western betrayal#The Phony War|failed to provide any meaningful support]]. The German-French border saw only [[Saar Offensive|a few minor skirmishes]], although the majority of German forces, including eighty-five percent of their armoured forces, were engaged in Poland. Despite some Polish successes in minor border battles, German technical, operational and numerical superiority forced the Polish armies to retreat from the borders towards Warsaw and [[Lw<U+00F3>w]]. The ''Luftwaffe'' gained [[air superiority]] early in the campaign. By destroying communications, the Luftwaffe increased the pace of the advance which overran Polish airstrips and early warning sites and causing logistical problems for the Poles. Many [[Polish Air Force]] units ran low on supplies, 98 of their number withdrew into then-neutral [[Romania]].<ref name="E.R Hooton, p87">E.R Hooton, p87</ref> The Polish initial strength of 400 was reduced to just 54 by September 14 and air opposition virtually ceased.<ref name="E.R Hooton, p87"/>

By 3 September when [[G<U+00FC>nther von Kluge]] in the north had reached the Vistula (some 10 kilometres from the German border at that time) river and [[Georg von K<U+00FC>chler]] was approaching the [[Narew]] River, [[Walther von Reichenau]]'s armour was already beyond the [[Warta]] river; two days later, his left wing was well to the rear of [[<U+0141><U+00F3>d<U+017A>]] and his right wing at the town of [[Kielce]]; and by 8 September one of his armoured corps was on the outskirts of Warsaw, having advanced 225 kilometres (140&nbsp;miles) in the first week of war. Light divisions on Reichenau's right were on the [[Vistula]] between Warsaw and the town of [[Sandomierz]] by 9 September while List, in the south, was on the river [[San River|San]] above and below the town of [[Przemy<U+015B>l]]. At the same time, Guderian led his 3rd Army tanks across the Narew, attacking the line of the [[Western Bug|Bug]] River, already encircling Warsaw. All the German armies made progress in fulfilling their parts of the Fall Weiss plan. The Polish armies were splitting up into uncoordinated fragments, some of which were retreating while others were launching disjointed attacks on the nearest German columns.

Polish forces abandoned the regions of [[Pomerelia]] (the [[Polish Corridor]]), [[Greater Poland]] and [[Autonomous Silesian Voivodship|Polish Upper Silesia]] in the first week. The Polish plan for border defence was proven a dismal failure. The German advance as a whole was not slowed. On 10 September the Polish commander-in-chief, Marshal [[Edward Rydz-<U+015A>mig<U+0142>y]], ordered a [[Withdrawal (military)|general retreat]] to the southeast, towards the so-called [[Romanian bridgehead]].<ref name="Stanley S 1977, pp. 29">Stanley S.Seidner, "Reflections from Rumania and Beyond: Marshal <U+015A>mig<U+0142>y-Rydz Rydz in Exile," The Polish Review vol. xxii, no. 2, 1977, pp. 29<U+2013>51.</ref> Meanwhile, the Germans were tightening their encirclement of the Polish forces west of the Vistula (in the <U+0141><U+00F3>d<U+017A> area and, still farther west, around [[Pozna<U+0144>]]) and also penetrating deeply into eastern Poland. Warsaw, under heavy aerial bombardment since the first hours of the war, was attacked on 9 September and was [[Siege of Warsaw (1939)|put under siege]] on September 13. Around that time, advanced German forces also reached the city of Lw<U+00F3>w, a major [[metropolis]] in eastern Poland. 1,150 German aircraft bombed Warsaw on 24 September.

[[Image:Polish artillery Battle of Bzura 1939.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A bombed Polish Army column during the [[Battle of the Bzura]]|alt=A bombed Polish Army column during the Battle of the Bzura.]]
The largest battle during this campaign, the [[Battle of Bzura]], took place near the [[Bzura]] river west of Warsaw and lasted from 9 September to 19 September.
Polish armies ''Pozna<U+0144>'' and ''Pomorze'', retreating from the border area of the Polish Corridor, attacked the flank of the advancing German 8th Army, but the counterattack failed after initial success. After the defeat, Poland lost its ability to take the initiative and counterattack on a large scale. German air power was instrumental during the battle. The ''Luftwaffe'''s offensive broke what remained of Polish resistance in an "awesome demonstration of air power".<ref name="E.R Hooton, p91">E.R Hooton, p91</ref> The Luftwaffe quickly destroyed the bridges across the Bzura River. Afterward, the Polish forces were trapped out in the open, and were attacked by wave after wave of Stukas, dropping 50&nbsp;kg 'light bombs' which caused huge numbers of casualties. The Polish flak positions ran out of ammunition and retreated to the forests, but were then 'smoked out' by the [[Heinkel He 111]] and [[Dornier Do 17]]s dropping 100&nbsp;kg incendiaries. The Luftwaffe left the army with the easy task of mopping up survivors. The ''Stukageschwaders'' alone dropped 388 [[tonnes]] of bombs during this battle.<ref name="E.R Hooton, p91"/>

The Polish government (of President [[Ignacy Mo<U+015B>cicki]]) and the high command (of [[Marshal of Poland|Marshal]] Edward Rydz-<U+015A>mig<U+0142>y) left Warsaw in the first days of the campaign and headed southeast, reaching [[Brest, Belarus|Brze<U+015B><U+0107>]] on 6 September. Rydz-<U+015A>mig<U+0142>y ordered the Polish forces to retreat in the same direction, behind the Vistula and San rivers, beginning the preparations for the long defence of the Romanian bridgehead area.<ref name="Stanley S 1977, pp. 29"/>

Retrieved 14 November 2006</ref> Worried by an unexpectedly rapid German advance and eager to grab their allotted share of the country, Soviet forces attacked Poland on 17 September. It was agreed that the USSR would relinquish its interest in the territories between the new border and Warsaw in exchange for inclusion of [[Lithuania]] in the Soviet "zone of interest". The USSR had openly supported German aggression, as Molotov stated after the Polish defeat:

By 17 September 1939, the Polish defence was already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead. However, these plans were rendered obsolete nearly overnight, when the over 800,000 strong Soviet Union [[Red Army]] entered and created the Belarussian and [[Ukrainian Front (1939)|Ukrainian]] [[Front (Soviet Army)|fronts]] after invading the [[Kresy|eastern regions of Poland]] in violation of the [[Riga Peace Treaty]], the [[Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact]], and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.{{#tag:ref|Other treaties violated by the Soviet Union were: the 1919 [[Covenant of the League of Nations]] (to which the USSR adhered in 1934), the [[Briand-Kellogg Pact]] of 1928 and the 1933 London Convention on the Definition of Aggression.<ref>{{cite book | author =[[Tadeusz Piotrowski (sociologist)|Tadeusz Piotrowski]] | coauthors = | title =Poland's Holocaust: Ethnic Strife, Collaboration with Occupying Forces and Genocide... | year =1997 | editor = | pages = | chapter = | chapterurl = | publisher =McFarland & Company | location = | isbn =0-7864-0371-3| url =http://books.google.com/books?visbn=0786403713&id=A4FlatJCro4C&pg=PA295&lpg=PA295&dq=1939+Soviet+citizenship+Poland&sig=qETeuFX3hbmM0VPSO13o0LmjgEc | accessdate = }}</ref>|group="Note"}} Soviet diplomacy claimed that they were "protecting the [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] and [[Belarusians|Belarusian]] minorities of eastern Poland in view of Polish imminent collapse".

===Civilian losses===
[[Image:Polish victim of German Luftwaffe action 1939.jpg|thumb|right|Ten year old Polish girl mourns the death of her older sister, who was killed during a German air raid by Luftwaffe]]
The Polish September Campaign was an instance of [[total war]]. Consequently, civilian casualties were high during and after combat. From the start, the ''Luftwaffe'' attacked civilian targets and columns of refugees along the roads to wreak havoc, disrupt communications and target Polish morale. Apart from the victims of the battles, the German forces (both [[SS]] and the regular ''Wehrmacht'') are credited with the [[mass murder]] of several thousands of Polish POWs and civilians. Also, during [[Operation Tannenberg]], nearly 20,000 Poles were shot at 760 mass execution sites by special units, the ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]'', in addition to regular ''Wehrmacht'', SS and ''[[Selbstschutz]]''.

Altogether, the civilian losses of Polish population amounted to about 150,000<U+2013>200,000<ref>''Poland's Holocaust: Ethnic Strife, Collaboration with Occupying Forces and Genocide in the Second Republic, 1918-1947'' Tadeusz Piotrowski page 301 McFarland, 1998</ref> while German civilian losses amounted to roughly 3,250 (including 2,000 who died fighting Polish troops as members of a [[fifth column]]).<ref>{{pl icon}} Tomasz Chinci<U+0144>ski, ''[http://www.ipn.gov.pl/portal/pl/236/3740/nr_2_82005_8211_cena_3600_zl.html Niemiecka dywersja w Polsce w 1939 r. w <U+015B>wietle dokument<U+00F3>w policyjnych i wojskowych II Rzeczypospolitej oraz s<U+0142>u<U+017C>b specjalnych III Rzeszy.

Poland was divided among Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union, Lithuania and [[Slovak Republic (WWII)|Slovakia]]. On 8 and 13 September 1939, the German military districts of "Posen" (Poznan), commanded by general [[Alfred von Vollard-Bockelberg]], and "Westpreu<U+00DF>en" (West Prussia), commanded by general [[Walter Heitz]], were established in conquered [[Greater Poland]] and [[Pomerelia]], respectively.<ref name=Toppe398>Andreas Toppe, Milit<U+00E4>r und Kriegsv<U+00F6>lkerrecht: Rechtsnorm, Fachdiskurs und Kriegspraxis in Deutschland 1899-1940, Oldenbourg Wissenschaftsverlag, 2008, p.398, ISBN 3486582062</ref> Based on laws of 21 May 1935 and 1 June 1938, the German military, [[Wehrmacht]], shared its administrative powers with civilian "chief civil administrators" (''Chefs der Zivilverwaltung, CdZ'').<ref name=Toppe397>Andreas Toppe, Milit<U+00E4>r und Kriegsv<U+00F6>lkerrecht: Rechtsnorm, Fachdiskurs und Kriegspraxis in Deutschland 1899-1940, Oldenbourg Wissenschaftsverlag, 2008, p.397, ISBN 3486582062</ref> German dictator [[Adolf Hitler]] appointed [[Arthur Greiser]] to become the CdZ of the Posen military district, and [[Free City of Danzig|Danzig]]'s [[Gauleiter]] [[Albert Forster]] to become the CdZ of the West Prussian military district.<ref name=Toppe398/> On 3 October 1939, the military districts "Lodz" and "Krakau" (Cracow) were set up under command of colonel-generals (generalobersten) [[Gerd von Rundstedt]] and [[Wilhelm List]], and Hitler appointed [[Hans Frank]] and [[Arthur Sey<U+00DF>-Inquart]] as civil heads, respectively.<ref name=Toppe398/> Frank was at the same time appointed "supreme chief administrator" for all occupied territories.<ref name=Toppe398/> On 28 September another secret German-Soviet [[Protocol (treaty)|protocol]] modified the arrangements of August: all Lithuania was to be a Soviet sphere of influence, not a German one; but the dividing line in Poland was moved in Germany's favour, to the Bug River. On 8 October Nazi Germany formally [[Polish areas annexed by Nazi Germany|annexed the western parts of Poland]] with Greiser and Forster as [[Reichsstatthalter]], while the south-central parts were administered as the so-called [[General Government]] led by Frank.

Even though water barriers separated most of the spheres of interest, the Soviet and German troops met on numerous occasions. The most remarkable event of this kind occurred at [[Brest-Litovsk]] on 22 September. The German 19th Panzer Corps under the command of [[Heinz Guderian]] had occupied the city, which lay within the Soviet sphere of interest. When the Soviet 29th Tank Brigade under the command of S.

Krivoshein approached, the commanders negotiated that the German troops would withdraw and the Soviet troops would enter the city saluting each other.<ref> <U+041A><U+0440><U+0438><U+0432><U+043E><U+0448><U+0435><U+0438><U+043D> <U+0421>.<U+041C>.

The German troops left the area, and the Red Army troops entered Lviv on 22 September.
About 65,000 Polish troops were killed in the fighting, with 420,000 others being captured by the Germans and 240,000 more by the Soviets (for a total of 660,000 prisoners). Up to 120,000 Polish troops escaped to [[Neutral country|neutral]] [[Romania]] (through the Romanian Bridgehead) and [[Hungary]], and another 20,000 to [[Latvia]] and Lithuania, with the majority eventually making their way to France or Britain. Most of the Polish Navy succeeded in evacuating to Britain as well. German personnel losses were less than their enemies (~16,000 [[Killed in Action|KIA]]).

Neither side<U+2014>Germany, the Western Allies or the Soviet Union<U+2014>expected that the German invasion of Poland would lead to a war that would surpass World War I in its scale and cost. It would be months before Hitler would see the futility of his peace negotiation attempts with Great Britain and France, but the culmination of combined European and Pacific conflicts would result in what was truly a "world war". Thus, what was not seen by most politicians and generals in 1939 is clear from the historical perspective: The Polish September Campaign marked the beginning of the [[European Theatre of World War II|Second World War in Europe]], which combined with the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Japanese invasion of China]] in 1937 and the [[Pacific War]] in 1941, formed the cataclysm known as World War II.

The invasion of Poland led to Britain and France to declare war on Germany on 3 September. However, they did little to affect the outcome of the September Campaign. This lack of direct help led many Poles to believe that they had been [[Western betrayal#Up to 1939|betrayed by their Western allies]].

On 23 May 1939, Adolf Hitler explained to his officers that the object of the aggression was not Danzig, but the need to obtain German [[Lebensraum]] and details of this concept would be later formulated in the infamous [[Generalplan Ost]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0521618266&id=a-Wb45gW3P4C&pg=PA44&lpg=PA44&q=Lebensraum+1939&vq=Lebensraum+1939&dq=poland+german+puppet+state+anti-comintern&sig=8zHEvm8I2ysilvrYIah0mOtoOiQ|title=A World at Arms}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0521558689&id=i2Z5blE1KGoC&pg=PA148&lpg=PA148&dq=May+23+Hitler+lebensraum&sig=ljEb7tTkSLQ7eUPjObWawjp4jps|title=Justice and the Genesis of War}}</ref> The invasion decimated [[Urban area|urban]] residential areas, civilians soon became indistinguishable from combatants, and the forthcoming German occupation (both on the [[Polish areas annexed by Nazi Germany|annexed territories]] and in the [[General Government]]) was one of the most brutal episodes of World War II, resulting in more than 6 million Polish deaths (about 20 % of the country's ''total'' population, and over 90 % of its Jewish minority) <U+2013> including the mass murder of 3 million Poles in [[extermination camp]]s like [[Auschwitz]], in concentration camps, and in numerous ad hoc massacres, where civilians were rounded up, taken to a nearby forest, machine-gunned, and then buried, whether they were dead or not.

[[Polish areas annexed by the Soviet Union|Soviet occupation]] between 1939 and 1941 resulted in the death or [[deportation]] of over a million or former Polish citizens, when all who were deemed dangerous to the Soviet regime were subject to [[sovietization]], forced resettlement, imprisonment in [[labour camp]]s (the [[Gulag]]s) or murdered, like the Polish officers in the [[Katyn massacre]].{{Ref_label|a|a|1}}

=== Nazi propaganda ===
{{Cleanup-section|date=September 2009}}

There are several common misconceptions regarding the Polish September Campaign, often resulting from myths perpetrated by Nazi propaganda.
*'''Myth''': ''The Polish Army fought German tanks with horse-mounted cavalry wielding lances and swords''.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Poland had 11 [[cavalry]] [[brigade]]s and its [[Military doctrine|doctrine]] emphasized cavalry units as elite units, other armies of that time (including German and Soviet) also fielded and extensively used horse cavalry units. [[Polish cavalry]] (equipped with [[Anti-tank rifle, model 35|anti tank rifles "UR"]] and light artillery like the highly effective [[Bofors 37 mm]] [[antitank gun]]) never charged German tanks or entrenched infantry or artillery directly, but usually acted as [[mobile infantry]] (like [[dragoon]]s) and [[reconnaissance]] units and executed cavalry charges only in rare situations against enemy infantry. The myth most likely originated from the [[German propaganda]] portrayal of the [[battle of Krojanty]], when Polish cavalry was fired upon by hidden armored vehicles after having mounted a sabre-charge against German infantry. <ref group="Note">Snidner takes issue here with this contention on at least one occasion. Seidner,''Marshal Edward <U+015A>mig<U+0142>y-Rydz Rydz and the Defense of Poland''</ref> <ref>http://www.polamjournal.com/Library/APHistory/Cavalry_Myth/cavalry_myth.html "The Mythical Polish Cavalry Charge", Polish American Journal, July 2008 by Gilbert J. Mros</ref>
*'''Myth''': ''The Polish air force was destroyed on the ground in the first days of the war''.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The [[Polish Air Force order of battle in 1939|Polish Air Force]], though numerically inferior, had been moved from air bases to small camouflaged airfields shortly before the war. Only some [[trainer aircraft|trainers]] and auxiliary aircraft were destroyed on the ground. The Polish Air Force, significantly outnumbered and with its fighters outmatched by more advanced German fighters, remained active up to the second week of the campaign, inflicting significant damage on the ''Luftwaffe''.<ref>Steven J. Zaloga, Ramiro Bujeiro, Howard Gerrard, ''Poland 1939: the birth of blitzkrieg'', Osprey Publishing, 2002, ISBN 1841764086, [http://books.google.com/books?id=oQeAKAjlEwMC&pg=PA50&dq=Polish+airforce+1939+ground Google Print, p.50]</ref> The ''Luftwaffe'' lost, to all operational causes, 285 aircraft, with 279 more damaged, while the Poles lost 333 aircraft.<ref>Overy, Richard J., [http://books.google.com/books?id=Uocntt1lGDUC&pg=PA28&lpg=PA28 ''The Air War: 1939-1945''], London, Europa Publications, 1980. p. 28</ref>
*'''Myth''': ''Poland offered little resistance and surrendered quickly''.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Germany sustained relatively heavy losses, especially in vehicles and planes: Poland cost the Germans approximately the equipment of an entire armored division and 25% of its air strength.<ref>Bekker, Cajus (1964): Angriffshohe <U+2013> 285 aircraft destroyed, 279 damaged of initial force</ref> As for duration, the September Campaign lasted only about one week less than the [[Battle of France]] in 1940, even though the Anglo-French forces were much closer to parity with the Germans in numerical strength and equipment.<ref group="Note" name="FrenchForces">Polish to Germany forces in the September Campaign: 1,000,000 soldiers 4,300 guns, 880 tanks, 435 aircraft (Poland) to 1,800,000 soldiers, 10,000 guns, 2,800 tanks, 3,000 aircraft (Germany). French and participating Allies to German forces in the Battle of France: 2,862,000 soldiers, 13,974 guns, 3,384 tanks, 3,099 aircraft 2 (Allies) to 3,350,000 soldiers, 7,378 guns, 2,445 tanks, 5,446 aircraft (Germany).</ref> Furthermore, the Polish Army was preparing the [[Romanian Bridgehead]], which would have prolonged Polish defence, but this plan was cancelled due to the Soviet invasion of Poland on September 17, 1939.<ref>Seidner,''Marshal Edward <U+015A>mig<U+0142>y-Rydz Rydz and the Defense of Poland'', ch. 3</ref> Poland also never officially surrendered to the Germans. Under German occupation, the Polish army continued to fight underground, as [[Armia Krajowa]] and forest partisans <U+2013> [[Le<U+015B>ni]]. The [[Polish resistance movement in World War II]] in German-[[occupied Poland]] was the largest resistance movement in all of occupied Europe.<ref>Zamoyski, Adam. [[The Polish Way]]. New York: Hippocrene Books, 1987</ref>
*'''Myth''': ''[[Blitzkrieg]] was first used in Poland''.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is often assumed that blitzkrieg is the strategy that Germany first used in Poland. Many early postwar histories, such as Barrie Pitt's in ''The Second World War'' (BPC Publishing 1966), attribute German victory to "enormous development in military technique which occurred between 1918 and 1940", citing that "Germany, who translated (British inter-war) theories into action<U+2026> called the result ''Blitzkrieg''." This idea has been repudiated by some authors. Matthew Cooper writes: "Throughout the Polish Campaign, the employment of the mechanized units revealed the idea that they were intended solely to ease the advance and to support the activities of the infantry<U+2026>. Thus, any strategic exploitation of the armoured idea was still-born. The paralysis of command and the breakdown of morale were not made the ultimate aim of the&nbsp;<U+2026> German ground and air forces, and were only incidental by-products of the traditional manoeuvers of rapid encirclement and of the supporting activities of the flying artillery of the [[Luftwaffe]], both of which had as their purpose the physical destruction of the enemy troops. Such was the ''[[Vernichtungsgedanke]]'' of the Polish campaign."<ref name=Cooper>Matthew Cooper, ''The German Army 1939<U+2013>1945: Its Political and Military Failure'', p. 176</ref> ''Vernichtungsgedanke'' was a strategy dating back to [[Frederick the Great]], and was applied in the Polish Campaign little changed from the [[Franco-Prussian War|French campaigns in 1870]] or 1914. The use of [[tank]]s "left much to be desired...Fear of enemy action against the flanks of the advance, fear which was to prove so disastrous to German prospects in the west in 1940 and in the Soviet Union in 1941, was present from the beginning of the war.""<ref name=Cooper/> John Ellis, writing in ''[[Brute Force (book)|Brute Force]]'' asserted that "<U+2026>there is considerable justice in Matthew Cooper's assertion that the panzer divisions were not given the kind of ''strategic'' (emphasis in original) mission that was to characterize authentic armoured ''blitzkrieg'', and were almost always closely subordinated to the various mass infantry armies."<ref>Ellis, John (1999). ''Brute Force: Allied Strategy and Tactics in the Second World War'', p.3<U+2013>4</ref> Zaloga and Madej, in ''The Polish Campaign 1939'', also address the subject of mythical interpretations of Blitzkrieg and the importance of other arms in the campaign. "Whilst Western accounts of the September campaign have stressed the shock value of the panzers and Stuka attacks, they have ''tended to underestimate the punishing effect of German artillery'' (emphasis added) on Polish units. Mobile and available in significant quantity, artillery shattered as many units as any other branch of the Wehrmacht."<ref name=Cooper>Matthew Cooper, ''The German Army 1939<U+2013>1945: Its Political and Military Failure'', p. 4</ref>
