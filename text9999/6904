The '''Situationist International''' ('''SI''') was an [[Proletarian internationalism|international]] [[Social revolution|revolutionary]] organization with an exclusive membership of [[avant-garde]] artists, intellectuals, and political theorists, active from its formation in 1957 to its dissolution in 1972.<ref name="Plant1992TheMost">{{cite book | last=Plant | first=Sadie | title=The Most Radical Gesture | publisher=Routledge | location=New York | year=1992 | isbn=978-0-415-06222-0}}</ref>

The intellectual foundation of the Situationist International derived from [[Libertarian Marxism|anti-authoritarian Marxism]] and the avant-garde [[Art movement|art movements]] of the early 20th century, namely [[Dada]] and [[Surrealism]]; situationist theory represented an attempt to synthesize these theoretical disciplines, as well as other influences, into a comprehensive and modern critique of mid-20th century [[advanced capitalism]].<ref name="Plant1992TheMost"/>

Although the situationists recognized [[capitalism]] had changed since Marx's formative writings, they argued that Marx's analysis of the structure and [[Social class|class system]] of capitalism remained fundamentally correct, and they resolutely rejected the idea that advanced capitalism's apparent successes<U+2014>such as technological advancement, increased income, and increased leisure<U+2014>could ever outweigh the misery of [[social alienation]] and [[commodity fetishism]] it simultaneously inflicted.<ref name="Plant1992TheMost"/> This understanding of modern society was significantly influenced by [[Marx's theory of alienation]], which the situationists extensively expanded upon and adapted; they asserted that the extension of social alienation and commodity relations was no longer limited to the fundamental components of capitalist society, such as [[Capitalist mode of production|production]] or the class system, but now reached across every aspect of life and culture.<ref name="Plant1992TheMost"/>

Essential to situationist theory was the concept of [[Spectacle (critical theory)|the spectacle]], a unified critique of [[advanced capitalism]] of which a primary concern was the progressively increasing tendency towards the expression and mediation of [[social relation|social relations]] through [[Commodity (Marxism)|objects]].<ref name="Plant1992TheMost"/> The situationists believed that the shift from individual expression through directly lived experiences, or the first-hand fulfillment of authentic desires, to individual expression by proxy through the exchange or [[Consumption (sociology)|consumption]] of [[Commodity (Marxism)|commodities]], or passive second-hand alienation, inflicted significant and far-reaching damage to the quality of human life for both individuals and society.<ref name="Plant1992TheMost"/> Another important concept of situationist theory was the primary means of counteracting the spectacle; the construction of situations, moments of life deliberately constructed for the purpose of reawakening and pursuing authentic desires, experiencing the feeling of life and adventure, and the liberation of everyday life.<ref name="Plant1992TheMost"/><ref name="Debord1958Definitions">Guy Debord (1958) ''[http://www.cddc.vt.edu/sionline/si/definitions.html Definitions]''.

When the Situationist International was first formed, it had a predominantly artistic focus; emphasis was placed on concepts like [[unitary urbanism]] and [[psychogeography]].<ref name="Plant1992TheMost"/> Gradually, however, that focus shifted more towards revolutionary and political theory.<ref name="Plant1992TheMost"/> The Situationist International reached the apex of its influence and creative output in 1967 and 1968, with the former marking the publication of the two most significant texts of the situationist movement, ''[[The Society of the Spectacle]]'' by [[Guy Debord]] and ''[[The Revolution of Everyday Life]]'' by [[Raoul Vaneigem]]. The expressed writing and political theory of the two aforementioned texts, along with other situationist publications, proved greatly influential in shaping the ideas behind the [[May 1968 events in France|May 1968 insurrections in France]]; quotes, phrases, and slogans from situationist texts and publications were ubiquitous on posters and graffiti throughout France during the uprisings.<ref name="Plant1992TheMost"/>

==Etymology==
The appellation "situationist" refers to one who engages in the construction of "situations" or specifically a member of the Situationist International.<ref name="Debord1958Definitions"/> In adjectival form, the term means relating to the theory or practical activity of constructing "situations."<ref name="Debord1958Definitions"/> Situationist theorist [[Guy Debord]] defines the term "situation" as "a moment of [[life]] concretely and deliberately constructed by the collective organization of a unitary ambiance and a game of events."<ref name="Debord1958Definitions"/> According to Debord, the Situationist International is so named because the construction of situations is the central idea of their theory, a process he describes as "the concrete construction of momentary ambiances of life and their [[transformation]] into a superior passional quality."<ref name="Debord1957Report"/> In other words, any method of making one or more individuals critically analyze their [[everyday life]], and to recognize and pursue their true [[Desire (emotion)|desires]] in their lives. The experimental direction of situationist activity consists of setting up temporary environments that are favorable to the fulfillment of such desires.<ref name="PreliminarySituations">Guy Debord (1958) ''[http://www.cddc.vt.edu/sionline/si/problems.html Preliminary Problems in Constructing a Situation]''.

The Situationist International strongly resisted use of the term "situationism," which Debord called a "meaningless term . . .

==History==
===Origins (1945-1955)===
[[File:Debord.gif|thumb|right|[[French people|French]] writer, [[Libertarian Marxism|Marxist theorist]], and filmmaker [[Guy Debord]], founding member of the Situationist International.]]

The situationist movement had its origins as a left wing tendency within [[Lettrism]],<ref name="ReportManifesto57">''[[Report on the Construction of Situations]]'' (1957)</ref><ref name="SI58">[http://www.cddc.vt.edu/sionline///si/is1.html Internationale Situationniste #1 (June 1958)]</ref> an artistic and literary movement led by the Romanian-born French poet and visual artist [[Isidore Isou]], originating in 1940s Paris. The group was heavily influenced by the preceding avante-garde movements of [[Dadaism]] and [[Surrealism]], seeking to apply critical theories based on these concepts to all areas of art and culture, most notably in [[poetry]], [[film]], [[painting]] and [[political theory]].<ref name="Debord1957Report"/> Among some of the concepts and artistic innovations developed by the Lettrists were the ''lettrie'', a [[poetry|poem]] reflecting pure form yet devoid of all semantic content, new syntheses of writing and visual art identified as [[metagraphics]] and [[hypergraphics]], as well as new creative techniques in [[filmmaking]]. Future situationist [[Guy Debord]], who was at that time a significant figure in the Lettrist movement, helped develop these new film techniques, using them in his Lettrist film ''[[Howls for Sade]]'' (1952) as well as later in his situationist film ''[[The Society of the Spectacle (film)|Society of the Spectacle]]'' (1972).

By 1950, a much younger and more [[left-wing]] part of the Lettrist movement began to emerge. This group kept very active in perpetrating public outrages such as the [[Notre-Dame Affair]], wherein at the [[Easter]] High Mass at [[Notre Dame de Paris]], in front of ten thousand people and broadcast on national TV, their member and former Dominican Michel Mourre posed as a [[monk]], "stood in front of the altar and read a pamphlet proclaiming that God was dead".<ref name="Horn07p8">Horn (2007), p.8</ref><ref name="Marcus89p279-86">[[Greil Marcus]] (1989) ''[[Lipstick Traces: A Secret History of the 20th Century]]'', [http://books.google.com/books?id=TVAoeipLL38C preview] at Google books, pp.279-86</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=To have done with the judgment of God | author=| url=http://www.snarkout.org/archives/2002/11/24/ | publisher=Snarkout | date=2002-11-24 | accessdate=2008-06-23}}{{Dead link|date=March 2011}}{{Request quotation|date=March 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=COSTRUIRE L'UNITA' D'AREA/2 | author=Adriano Scianca | url=http://www.mirorenzaglia.com/index.php?itemid=8 | publisher=miro renzaglia | date=2006-05-09 | accessdate=2008-06-23}}{{Dead link|date=March 2011}}{{Request quotation|date=March 2011}}</ref> [[Andr<U+00E9> Breton]] prominently came in solidarity of the action in a letter that spawned a large debate in newspaper ''[[Combat (newspaper)|Combat]]''.<ref name="Boucharenc05">Boucharenc, Myriam (2005) [http://books.google.com/books?id=uYKf2PLK1BgC ''L'universel reportage''], pp.94-6</ref><ref name="Breton50NotreDame">[[Andr<U+00E9> Breton|Breton, Andr<U+00E9>]] (1950) [http://juralibertaire.over-blog.com/article-le-scandale-de-notre-dame-41681161.html ''Lettre a Louis Pauwels" sur le <U+00AB>"scandale" de Notre Dame<U+00BB>''], in ''[[Combat (newspaper)|Combat]]'', April 12, 1950, ''OC III'', pp.1024-5</ref>

In 1952, this left wing of the [[Lettrism|Lettrist]] movement, which included Debord, broke off from Isou's group and formed the [[Letterist International]], a new Paris-based collective of [[avante-garde]] artists and political theorists. The schism finally erupted when the future members of the radical{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Lettrists disrupted a [[Charlie Chaplin]] press conference for ''[[Limelight (1952 film)|Limelight]]'' at the [[H<U+00F4>tel Ritz Paris]]. They distributed a [[polemic]] entitled "No More Flat Feet!", which concluded: "The footlights have melted the make-up of the supposedly brilliant mime. All we can see now is a lugubrious and mercenary old man. Go home Mister Chaplin."<ref name="Berna1952No">Serge Berna, Jean-Louis Brau, Guy Debord & Gil J.

Emphasis in original.</ref> Isou was upset with this, his own attitude being that Chaplin deserved respect as one of the great creators of the cinematic art. The breakaway group felt that his work was no longer relevant, while having appreciated it "in its own time," and asserted their belief "that the most urgent expression of freedom is the destruction of idols, especially when they claim to represent freedom," in this case, filmmaker Charlie Chaplin.<ref name="1952Position">(1952) ''[http://www.cddc.vt.edu/sionline/presitu/position.html Position of the Lettrist International]''. Internationale Lettriste #1 (Paris, November 1952). Translated by Ken Knabb.</ref>

During this period of the [[Letterist International]], many of the important concepts and ideas that would later be integral in situationist theory were developed. Individuals in the group collaboratively constructed the new field of [[psychogeography]], which they defined as "the study of the specific effects of the [[geography|geographical environment]] (whether consciously organized or not) on the emotions and behavior of individuals."<ref name="Debord1958Definitions"/><ref name="Debord1955Introduction">Guy Debord (1955) ''[http://www.cddc.vt.edu/sionline/presitu/geography.html Introduction to a Critique of Urban Geography]''. Les L<U+00E8>vres Nues #6 (Paris, September 1955). Translated by Ken Knabb.</ref> Debord further expanded this concept of psychogeography with his theory of the [[d<U+00E9>rive]], an unplanned tour through an [[city|urban]] landscape directed entirely by the feelings evoked in the individual by their surroundings, serving as the primary means for mapping and investigating the psychogeography of these different areas.<ref name="Debord1956Theory">Guy Debord (1956) ''[http://www.cddc.vt.edu/sionline/presitu/geography.html Theory of the D<U+00E9>rive]''. Les L<U+00E8>vres Nues #9 (Paris, November 1956). Reprinted in Internationale Situationniste #2 (Paris, December 1958). Translated by Ken Knabb.</ref> During this period the Letterist International also developed the situationist tactic of [[d<U+00E9>tournement]], which by reworking or re-contextualizing an existing work of art or literature sought to radically shift its meaning to one with revolutionary significance.

===Formation (1956-1957)===

In 1956, members of the Letterist International made contact with several different artistic collectives at the ''First World Congress of Free Artists'' in [[Alba, Piedmont|Alba]], [[Italy]],<ref name="Horn07p5-7">Horn (2007), pp.5-7, 42</ref> finding significant common ground politically and philosophically.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} In July 1957, the Situationist International was established with the fusion of several of these extremely small [[avant-garde]] artistic tendencies: the [[Lettrist International]], the [[International Movement for an Imaginist Bauhaus]] (an off-shoot of [[COBRA (avant-garde movement)|COBRA]]), and the [[London Psychogeographical Association]]. Later, the Situationist International drew ideas from other groups such as ''[[Socialisme ou Barbarie]]''.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

The most prominent member of the group, [[Guy Debord]], generally became considered the organization's [[de facto]] leader and most distinguished theorist. Other members included theorist [[Raoul Vaneigem]], the Dutch painter [[Constant Nieuwenhuys]], the Italo-Scottish writer [[Alexander Trocchi]], the English artist [[Ralph Rumney]] (sole member of the London Psychogeographical Association, Rumney suffered expulsion relatively soon after the formation), the Danish artist [[Asger Jorn]] (who after parting with the SI also founded the [[Scandinavian Institute of Comparative Vandalism]]), the architect and veteran of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian Uprising]] [[Attila Kotanyi]], and the French writer [[Michele Bernstein]]. Debord and Bernstein later married.

During the first four years from its formation, the pivot of the Situationist International was the collaboration between [[Guy Debord]] and [[Asger Jorn]].<ref name="Jappe99DebordJorn">[[Anselm Jappe]], 1999, p.65 quotation: <blockquote>For the first four years of the SI's existence, the pivot of the group was the collaboration between Debord and Asger Jorn, who complemented each other well precisely because they were so different.</blockquote></ref>

In June 1957, Debord wrote the [[manifesto]] of the Situationist International, titled ''[[Report on the Construction of Situations]]''. This manifesto plans a systematic{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} rereading of [[Karl Marx]]'s ''[[Das Kapital]]'' and advocates a cultural revolution in [[western countries]].<ref name="Debord1957Report">Guy Debord (1957) ''[http://www.cddc.vt.edu/sionline/si/report.html Report on the Construction of Situations and on the International Situationist Tendency's Conditions of Organization and Action]''. (Paris, June 1957). Translated by Ken Knabb.</ref>

===Artistic Period (1958-1962)===
[[File:Asger Jorn (1963) by Erling Mandelmann.jpg|thumb|right|[[Danes|Danish]] painter, sculptor, [[Ceramic art|ceramic artist]], and author [[Asger Jorn]], founding member of the Situationist International.]]

During the first few years of the SI's founding, [[avant-garde]] artistic groups began collaborating with the SI and joining the organization. [[Gruppe SPUR]], a [[Germans|German]] artistic collective, collaborated with the Situationist International on projects beginning in 1959, continuing until the group officially joined the SI in 1961. The role of the artists in the SI was of great significance, particularly [[Asger Jorn]], [[Constant Nieuwenhuys]] and [[Pinot Gallizio]].<ref name="PoliOntheReport"/>

Asger Jorn, who invented [[Situgraphy]] and [[Situlogy]], had the social role of catalyst and team leader among the members of the SI between 1957 and 1961. Jorn<U+2019>s role in the situationist movement (as in [[COBRA (avant-garde movement)|COBRA]]) was that of a catalyst and team leader. [[Guy Debord]] on his own lacked the personal warmth and persuasiveness to draw people of different nationalities and talents into an active working partnership. As a prototype [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[intellectual]] Debord needed an ally who could patch up the petty egoisms and squabbles of the members. When Jorn's leadership was withdrawn in 1961, many simmering quarrels among different sections of the SI flared up, leading to multiple exclusions.

The first major split was the exclusion of Gruppe SPUR, the German section, from the SI on February 10, 1962.<ref name="1963TheExclusion">(1963) ''[http://www.notbored.org/spur-exclusion.html The Exclusion of the Spurists]''. Internationale Situationniste #8 (Paris, January 1963). Translated by Ken Knabb.</ref> Many different disagreements led to the fracture, for example; while at the Fourth SI Conference in London in December, 1960, in a discussion about the political nature of the SI, the Gruppe SPUR members disagreed with the core situationist stance of counting on a [[revolutionary proletariat]];<ref name="SI5Conf4">''[http://www.cddc.vt.edu/SIOnline/si/london.html The Fourth SI Conference in London]'',[http://www.bopsecrets.org/SI/5.conf4.htm] Internationale Situationniste #5 (December 1960)</ref> the accusation that their activities were based on a "systematic misunderstanding of situationist theses";<ref name="1963TheExclusion"/> the understanding that at least one Gruppe SPUR member, [[sculptor]] [[Lothar Fischer]], and possibly the rest of the group, were not actually understanding and/or agreeing with the situationist ideas, but were just using the SI to achieve success in the [[Economics of the arts and literature|art market]].<ref name="1963TheExclusion"/><ref name="Kunzelmann">''[http://www.kurr.org/t_nothing.php Nothing to talk about]'', (essay/interview on [[Dieter Kunzelmann]]) Art-Ist 08, Istanbul, Turkey, Halil Altindere and Sezgin Boynik (editors)</ref> the betrayal, in the ''Spur #7'' issue, of a common agreement on the Gruppe SPUR and SI publications.<ref name="SI7Conf5">''[http://www.cddc.vt.edu/SIOnline/si/goteborg.html The Fifth SI Conference in G<U+00F6>teborg]'',[http://www.bopsecrets.org/SI/7.conf5.htm] Internationale Situationniste #7 (April 1962)</ref><ref name="DebordVernissage150362">[http://www.notbored.org/debord-15March1962.html Letter] from Guy Debord and [[Uwe Lausen]] to the journal ''Vernissage'', 15 March 1962</ref>

The exclusion was a recognition that [[Gruppe SPUR]]'s "principles, methods and goals" were significantly in contrast with those of the SI.<ref name="1963TheCounter"/><ref name="Debord180662">[http://www.notbored.org/debord-18June1962.html Letter] from [[Guy Debord]] to [[Rodolphe Gasche]] (member of the Gruppe SPUR), 18 June 1962</ref> This split however was not a declaration of hostilities, as in other cases of SI exclusions. A few months after the exclusion, in the context of judicial prosecution against the group by the German state, Debord expressed his esteem to Gruppe SPUR, calling it the only significant artist group in [[Germany]] since [[World War II]], and regarding it at the level of the [[avant-garde]]s in other countries.<ref name="DebordSpur280462">[http://www.notbored.org/debord-28April1962.html Letter] from Guy Debord To the Spur group, 28 April 1962</ref>

The next significant split was in 1962, wherein the "Nashists," the [[Scandinavia]]n section of the SI lead by [[J<U+00F8>rgen Nash]], were excluded from the organization for lacking the theoretical rigor demanded by the [[France|Franco]]-[[Belgium|Belgian]] section of SI led by Guy Debord. This excluded group would later declare themselves the [[2nd Situationist International]], basing their organization out of [[Sweden]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} Journalist [[Stewart Home]], who favored the "Nashists" and considered Debord a "mystic, an idealist, a dogmatist and a liar"<ref name="Jappe1999">[[Anselm Jappe]] (1999) ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=rfguCi3qQasC Guy Debord]'', p.177</ref> wrote that while the 2nd Situationist International sought to challenge the separation of art and politics from everyday life, Debord and the so-called 'specto-situationists'<ref name="AssaultOnCultureCh8">Stewart Home (1987) ''[http://www.stewarthomesociety.org/ass/sithree.htm The Assault on Culture Chapter 8 - The Decline and Fall of the Specto-Situationist Critique]''.</ref> sought to concentrate solely on theoretical political aims.<ref name="Kurczynski2005Beyond">[[Karen Kurczynski]] (2005) ''[http://members.chello.nl/j.seegers1/situationist/bib_jorn.html#criticism Beyond Expressionism: Asger Jorn and the European Avant-Garde, 1941-1961]'' (New York University: New York 2005)</ref>

===Political Period (1963-1968)===

By this point the Situationist International consisted almost exclusively of the Franco-Belgian section, led by [[Guy Debord]] and [[Raoul Vaneigem]], with some exceptions, such as Danish artist and author [[Asger Jorn]]. These members possessed much more of a tendency towards political theory over the more artistic aspects of the SI. The shift in the intellectual priorities within the SI resulted in more focus on the theoretical, such as the [[Spectacle (Situationism)|theory of the spectacle]] and [[Marxism|Marxist]] critical analysis, spending much less time on the more artistic and tangible concepts like [[unitary urbanism]], [[d<U+00E9>tournement]], and [[situgraphy]].<ref name="Blissett2002Guy">Luther Blissett (2002) ''[http://library.nothingness.org/articles/SI/en/pub_contents/9 Guy Debord Is Really Dead]''</ref>

During this period the SI began having more and more influence on local university students in [[France]]. Taking advantage of the apathy of their colleagues, five "Pro-situs", situationist-influenced students, infiltrated the [[University of Strasbourg]]'s [[Student activity center|student union]] in November 1966 and began scandalising the authorities.<ref name="Plant1992TheMost">{{cite book | last=Plant | first=Sadie | title=The Most Radical Gesture | publisher=Routledge | location=New York | year=1992 | isbn=978-0-415-06222-0 |page=94}}</ref><ref name="Vague1997Anarchy">{{cite book | last=Vague | first=Tom | title=Anarchy in the Uk: the Angry Brigade | publisher=AK Press | location=Stirling | year=1997 | isbn=978-1-873176-98-6 |pages=13<U+2013>14}}</ref> Their first action was to form an "[[social anarchism|anarchist]] appreciation society" called The Society for the Rehabilitation for [[Karl Marx]] and [[Ravachol]]; next they appropriated union funds to [[Flyposting|flypost]] "Return of [[the Durruti Column]]", [[Andre Bertrand]]'s ''[[d<U+00E9>tournement|d<U+00E9>tourned]]'' comic strip.<ref name="Vague1997Anarchy"/> They then invited the situationists to contribute a critique of the University of Strasbourg, and ''[[On the Poverty of Student Life]]'', written by [[Tunisia]]n situationist [[Mustapha/Omar Khayati]] was the result.<ref name="Vague1997Anarchy"/> The students promptly proceeded to print 10,000 copies of the pamphlet using university funds and distributed them during a ceremony marking the beginning of the [[academic year]]. This provoked an immediate outcry in the local, national and international media.<ref name="Vague1997Anarchy"/>

Quotations from two key situationist books, Debord's ''[[The Society of the Spectacle]]'' (1967) and Khayati's ''On the Poverty of Student Life'' (1966), were written on the walls of Paris and several provincial cities.<ref name="Vi<U+00E9>net68sec1" /> This was documented in the collection of photographs published in 1968 by [[Walter Lewino]], ''L'immagination au pouvoir''.<ref name="SI12BeginningOfAnEra">''The Beginning of an Era'' ([http://www.bopsecrets.org/SI/12.era1.htm part1], [http://www.bopsecrets.org/SI/12.era2.htm part 2]) Situationist International #12, 1969</ref>

Those who followed the "artistic" view of the SI might view the evolution of the SI as producing a more boring or dogmatic organization.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} Those following the political view would see the May 1968 uprisings as a logical outcome of the SI's [[dialectic]]al approach: while savaging present day society, they sought a revolutionary society which would embody the positive tendencies of capitalist development. The "realization and suppression of art" is simply the most developed of the many dialectical supersessions which the SI sought over the years. For the Situationist International of 1968, the world triumph of [[workers councils]] would bring about all these supersessions.

Though the SI were a very small group, they were expert self-propagandists, and their slogans appeared daubed on walls throughout Paris at the time of the revolt. SI member [[Ren<U+00E9> Vi<U+00E9>net]]'s 1968 book ''Enrag<U+00E9>s and Situationists in the Occupations Movement, France, May '68'' gives an account of the involvement of the SI with the student group of [[Enrag<U+00E9>s]] and the occupation of the [[Sorbonne]].

The occupations of 1968 started at the [[University of Nanterre]] and spread to the Sorbonne. The police tried to take back the Sorbonne and a riot ensued. Following this a general strike was declared with up to 10 million workers participating. The SI originally participated in the Sorbonne occupations and defended barricades in the riots. The SI distributed calls for the [[occupation of factories]] and the formation of [[workers<U+2019> councils]],<ref name="SI12BeginningOfAnEra"/> but, disillusioned with the students, left the university to set up [[The Council For The Maintenance Of The Occupations]] (CMDO) which distributed the SI<U+2019>s demands on a much wider scale. After the end of the movement, the CMDO disbanded.

===Aftermath (1968-1972)===
By 1972, [[Gianfranco Sanguinetti]] and [[Guy Debord]] were the only two remaining members of the SI. Working with Debord, in August 1975, Sanguinetti wrote a pamphlet titled ''Rapporto veridico sulle ultime opportunit<U+00E0> di salvare il capitalismo in Italia'' ({{lang-en|The Real Report on the Last Chance to Save Capitalism in Italy}}),<ref>[http://tangibleinfo.blogspot.com/2010/08/gianfranco-sanguinetti-full-text-of.html complete (translated) texts]</ref> which (inspired by [[Bruno Bauer]]) purported to be the cynical writing of "Censor", a powerful [[industrialist]]. The pamphlet argued that the ruling class of Italy supported the [[Piazza Fontana bombing]] and other covert, [[false flag]] mass slaughter for the higher goal of defending the capitalist status quo from communist influence. The pamphlet was mailed to 520 of Italy's most powerful individuals. It was received as genuine and powerful politicians, industrialists and journalists praised its content. After reprinting the tract as a small book, Sanguinetti revealed himself to be the true author. In the outcry that ensued <ref>[http://www.notbored.org/report.html Gianfranco Sanguinetti]</ref> and under pressure from Italian authorities Sanguinetti left Italy in February 1976, and was denied entry to France.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

==Main Concepts==
===The Spectacle and its society===
{{main|Spectacle (critical theory)}}
[[File:Debord SocietyofSpectacle.jpg|right|thumb|180px|Cover of film ''[[The Society of the Spectacle (film)|The Society of the Spectacle]]'', by Guy Debord, 1973]]

The ''Spectacle'' is a central notion in the situationist theory, developed by [[Guy Debord]] in his 1967 book, ''[[The Society of the Spectacle]]''. In its limited sense, ''spectacle'' means the [[mass media]], which are "its most glaring superficial manifestation."<ref name="Debord1977t24">Debord (1977) thesis 24</ref> Debord said that the society of the spectacle came to existence in the late 1920s.<ref name="Brush2005p377">Brush (2005) pp.377-8</ref><ref name="Debord1988cII">Debord (1988) ''Comments on the Society of the Spectacle'', II</ref>

The critique of the ''spectacle'' is a development and application of Karl Marx's concept of [[fetishism of commodities]], [[Reification (Marxism)|reification]] and [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]].,<ref name="Debord1967SocietyI">Guy Debord (1967) ''[http://www.cddc.vt.edu/sionline/si/tsots01.html Society of the Spectacle''. (Paris, June 1967). Chapter I: Separation Perfected.]</ref> and the way it was reprised by [[Gy<U+00F6>rgy Luk<U+00E1>cs]] in 1923. In the society of the spectacle, the commodities rule the workers and the [[Consumerism|consumers]] instead of being ruled by them. The consumers are passive subjects that contemplate the reified spectacle.

As early as 1958, in the [[Report on the Construction of Situations|situationist manifesto]], Debord described [[official culture]] as a "rigged game", where conservative powers forbid subversive ideas to have direct access to the [[public discourse]]. Such ideas get first trivialized and sterilized, and then they are safely [[Social integration|incorporated]] back within mainstream society, where they can be exploited to add new flavors to old dominant ideas.<ref>Debord (1957) pp.2, 10</ref> This technique of the spectacle is sometimes called ''recuperation'', and its counter-technique is the ''[[d<U+00E9>tournement]]''<ref name="Chasse1969Faces">Robert Chasse, Bruce Elwell, Jonathon Horelick, Tony Verlaan. (1969) ''[http://www.cddc.vt.edu/sionline/si/faces.html Faces of Recuperation]''. In the American section of the Situationist International, issue #1 (New York, June 1969).</ref>

===D<U+00E9>tournement===
{{main|d<U+00E9>tournement}}
A ''d<U+00E9>tournement'' is a technique developed in the 1950s by the [[Letterist International]],<ref name="ReportManifesto57">''[[Report on the Construction of Situations]]'' (1957)</ref><ref name="SI58">[http://www.cddc.vt.edu/sionline///si/is1.html Internationale Situationniste #1 (June 1958)]</ref> and consist in "turning expressions of the capitalist system against itself," <ref name="Holt2010p252">Holt (2010) p.252</ref> like turning slogans and logos against the advertisers or the political status quo.<ref>Martin Kaste [http://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=141526467 ''Exploring Occupy Wall Street's 'Adbuster' Origins''], ''NPR'', October 20, 2011</ref> ''D<U+00E9>tournement'' was prominently used to set up subversive political pranks, an influential tactic called [[situationist prank]] that was reprised by the [[punk movement]] in the late 1970s<ref name="Marrone05">Marrone, Gianfranco (2005) [http://books.google.com/books?id=0jluoyGktKsC ''Sensi alterati: droghe, musica, immagini''], p.45, quote:

===Anti-Capitalism===
The Situationist International, in the 15 years from its formation in 1957 and its dissolution in 1972, is characterized by a [[Marxist]] and [[surrealist]] perspective on [[aesthetics]] and politics,<ref name="PoliOnArtAndPolitics">[[Francesco Poli]] (1991) p.63. Quotation: <blockquote> Nel 1972, quindici anni dopo la sua fondazione [[...]] l'Internazionale Situazionista si scioglie in quanto organizzazione. Durante questi anni, il movimento, caratterizzato da un'ideologia dell'estetico e del politico di matrice marxista e surrealista, produce una quantita' consistente di scritti teorici, opuscoli, libri, film e lavori artistici nel campo della pittura e della progettazione di interventi nella dimensione urbana.

<br />Nel Rapporto di Debord si legge inoltre una durissima critica allo sfruttamento capitalistico delle masse anche nel tempo libero attraverso l'industria del divertimento che abbrutisce la gente con sottoprodotti dell'ideologia mistificata della borghesia.</blockquote></ref>

A major stance of the SI was to count on the force of a [[revolutionary proletariat]]. This stance was reaffirmed very clearly in a discussion on <U+201C>To what extent is the SI a political movement?<U+201D>, during the Fourth SI Conference in London.<ref name="SI5Conf4"/> The SI remarked that this is a core Situationist principle, and that those that don't understand it and agree with it, are not Situationist. Reactionary forces always try to hinder the still topical power of the working class. It was not by chance that [[May '68]], whose main feature was the largest [[general strike]] that ever stopped the economy of an [[Developed country|advanced industrial country]]<ref name="SitInt12">''[http://www.cddc.vt.edu/sionline/si/beginning.html The Beginning of an Era]'', from ''Situationist International'' No 12 (September 1969). Translated by [[Ken Knabb]].</ref> and the first [[Wildcat strike action|wildcat general strike]] in history,<ref name="SitInt12"/> was instead depicted by most media outlets as "student protests". That was precisely to mystify the still very topical role of a [[revolutionary proletariat]].
[[File:SI9Img15AnneMarie.jpg|left|thumb|Situationist leaflet in Denmark.<ref>Caption reads: "As en echo to the Spanish cartoons, which challenge together the strictly political censorship and the moral censorship of the clergymen, the Situationist International distributed this photo in Denmark, where the engagement of the [[Queen Anne-Marie of Greece|daughter of the socialdemocratic king]] with the [[Constantine II of Greece|Greek sovereign]] raised the polite protests of the Left. [[Christine Keeler]], on the famous photo attributed to Tony Armstrong-Jones, declares: 'As the Situationist International says, it is far more honorable to be a whore like me than to marry a fascist like Constantin.'"</ref>]]

===Art and Politics===

The SI rejected all art that separated itself from politics, the concept of [[20th century art]] that is separated from topical political events.<ref name="Debord1957Report"/><ref name="1963TheCounter">(1963) ''[http://www.cddc.vt.edu/SIOnline/si/counter.html The Counter-Situationist Campaign in Various Countries]''. Internationale Situationniste #8 (Paris, January 1963). Translated by Ken Knabb.</ref> The SI believed that the notion of artistic expression being separated from politics and current events is one proliferated by reactionary considerations to render artwork that expresses comprehensive critiques of society impotent.<ref name="Debord1957Report"/> They recognized there was a precise mechanism followed by reactionaries to defuse the role of subversive artists and intellectuals, that is, to [[reframing|reframe]] them as separated from the most topical events, and divert from them the taste for the new that may dangerously appeal the masses; after such separation, such artworks are sterilized, banalized, degraded, and can be safely integrated into the [[official culture]] and the public discourse, where they can add new flavors to old dominant ideas and play the role of a gear wheel in the mechanism of the society of the spectacle.<ref name="Debord1957Report"/>

According to this theory, artists and intellectuals that accept such compromises are rewarded by the [[art dealer]]s and praised by the dominant culture.<ref name="1963TheCounter"/> The SI received many offers to sponsor <U+201C>creations<U+201D> that would just have a "situationist" label but a diluted political content, that would have brought things back to order and the SI back into the old fold of artistic praxis. The majority of SI continued to refuse such offers and any involvement on the conventional avant-garde artistic plane.<ref name="1963TheCounter"/> This principle was affirmed since the founding of the SI in 1957, but the qualitative step of resolving all the contradictions of having situationists that make concessions to the cultural market, was made with the exclusion of [[Gruppe SPUR]] in 1962.<ref name="1963TheCounter"/>

The SI noted how reactionary forces forbid subversive ideas from artists and intellectuals to reach the [[public discourse]], and how they attack the artworks that express comprehensive critique of society, by saying that art should not involve itself into politics.<ref name="Debord1957Report"/>

===The Construction of Situations===
{{Expand section|date=February 2011}}

The first edition of ''Internationale Situationniste'' defines the constructed situation as "a moment of life concretely and deliberately constructed by the collective organization of a unitary ambiance and a game of events."

As the SI embraced dialectical Marxism, the situation came to refer less to a specific avant-garde practice than to the dialectical unification of art and life more generally. Beyond this theoretical definition, the situation as a practical manifestation thus slipped between a series of proposals. The SI thus were first led to distinguish the situation from the mere artistic practice of the [[happening]], and later identified it in historical events such as the [[Paris Commune]] in which it exhibited itself as the revolutionary moment.

===Psychogeography===
{{Main|Psychogeography}}
The first edition of ''Internationale Situationniste'' defined [[psychogeography]] as "the study of the specific effects of the geographical environment (whether consciously organized or not) on the emotions and behavior of individuals."<ref name="Debord1958Definitions"/> The term was first recognized in 1955 by Guy Debord while still with the Letterist International:

<blockquote>"The word psychogeography, suggested by an illiterate Kabyle as a general term for the phenomena a few of us were investigating around the summer of 1953, is not too inappropriate. It does not contradict the materialist perspective of the conditioning of life and thought by objective nature. Geography, for example, deals with the determinant action of general natural forces, such as soil composition or climatic conditions, on the economic structures of a society, and thus on the corresponding conception that such a society can have of the world. Psychogeography could set for itself the study of the precise laws and specific effects of the geographical environment, whether consciously organized or not, on the emotions and behavior of individuals. The charmingly vague adjective psychogeographical can be applied to the findings arrived at by this type of investigation, to their influence on human feelings, and more generally to any situation or conduct that seems to reflect the same spirit of discovery."<br>
- Guy Debord, ''Introduction to a Critique of Urban Geography''<ref name="Debord1955Introduction"/>
</blockquote>

====D<U+00E9>rive====
{{Main|D<U+00E9>rive}}
By definition, psychogeography combines subjective and objective knowledge and studies. Debord struggled to stipulate the finer points of this theoretical paradox, ultimately producing "Theory of the D<U+00E9>rive" in 1958, a document which essentially serves as an instruction manual for the psychogeographic procedure, executed through the act of [[d<U+00E9>rive]] ("drift").

{{quote|In a [[d<U+00E9>rive]] one or more persons during a certain period drop their usual motives for movement and action, their relations, their work and leisure activities, and let themselves be drawn by the attractions of the terrain and the encounters they find there<U+2026> But the d<U+00E9>rive includes both this letting go and its necessary contradiction: the domination of psychogeographical variations by the knowledge and calculation of their possibilities.|<ref name="Knabb, Ken 1995. pg 50">Knabb, Ken, ed. ''Situationist International Anthology'', Berkley: Bureau of Public Secrets, 1995. pg 50.</ref>}}

In the SI's 6th issue, [[Raoul Vaneigem]] writes in a manifesto of unitary urbanism, "All space is occupied by the enemy.  We are living under a permanent curfew.  Not just the cops <U+2013> the geometry".<ref>Gray, Christopher, editor, ''Leaving the 20th Century: the Incomplete Work of the Situationist International'', London: Rebel P, 1998. p26.</ref> D<U+00E9>rive, as a previously conceptualized tactic in the French military, was "a calculated action determined by the absence of a greater locus", and "a maneuver within the enemy's field of vision".<ref>McDonough, Tom, ed. ''Guy Debord and the Situationist International: Texts and Documents'', Boston: October Press, 2004. pg 259.</ref> To the SI, whose interest was inhabiting space, the d<U+00E9>rive brought appeal in this sense of taking the "fight" to the streets and truly indulging in a determined operation. The d<U+00E9>rive was a course of preparation, reconnaissance, a means of shaping situationist psychology among urban explorers for the eventuality of the situationist city.

===Work, Leisure, and Play===
{{Expand section|date=February 2011}}

The situationists observed that the worker of advanced capitalism still only functions with the goal of survival. In a world where technological efficiency has increased production exponentially, by tenfold, the workers of society still dedicate the whole of their lives to survival, by way of production. The purpose for which advanced capitalism is organized isn't luxury, happiness, or freedom, but production. The production of commodities is an end to itself; and production by way of survival.

The theorists of the Situationist International regarded the current paradigm of work in advanced capitalist society as increasingly absurd. As technology progresses, and work becomes exponentially efficient, the work itself becomes exponentially more trivial. The spectacle<U+2019>s social function is the concrete manufacture of alienation. Economic expansion consists primarily of the expansion of this particular sector of industrial production. The <U+201C>growth<U+201D> generated by an economy developing for its own sake can be nothing other than a growth of the very alienation that was at its origin.

===Relationship with Marxism===
{{Cleanup|section|date=February 2011}}

Rooted firmly in the [[Marxist]] tradition, the Situationist International criticized [[Trotskyist]]s, [[Marxism-Leninism]], [[Stalinism]] and [[Maoism]] from a position they believed to be further left and more properly Marxist. The situationists possessed a strong anti-authoritarian current, commonly deriding the centralized bureaucracies of [[People's Republic of China|China]] and the [[Soviet Union]] in the same breath as capitalism.

Debord's work ''[[The Society of the Spectacle]]'' (1967) established situationist analysis as [[Marxist analysis|Marxist]] critical theory.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} ''The Society of the Spectacle'' is widely recognized as the main and most influential Situationist essay.<ref name="Agamben1990">[[Giorgio Agamben]] (1990), "''Glosse in margine ai Commentari sulla societa dello spettacolo''" in {{Harvnb|Debord|1990|pp=233<U+2013>250}}:

Debord starts his 1967 work with a revisited version of the first sentence with which Marx began his critique of classical political economy, ''[[Das Kapital]]''.<ref name="DasKapitalEntrySentence">''[[Das Kapital]]'', entry sentence, p.125: "The wealth of societies in which the capitalist mode of production prevails appears as an 'immense collection of commodities'"</ref><ref name="DebordThesis1st">''"The whole life of those societies in which modern conditions of production prevail presents itself as an immense accumulation of spectacles."'' Debord G.E. (1967), thesis 1st.</ref> In a later essay, Debord will argue that his work was the most important social critique since Marx's work. Drawing from Marx, which argued that under a capitalist society the ''[[wealth]]'' is degraded to an immense accumulation of [[commodities]], Debord argues that in [[advanced capitalism]], life is reduced to an immense accumulation of spectacles, a triumph of mere appearance where "all that once was directly lived has become mere representation".<ref>Debord G.E. (1967) : thesis 17, 42</ref><ref>Giorgio Agamben, 1989</ref> The spectacle, which according to Debord is the core feature of the advanced capitalist societies,<ref>Debord G.E. (1967) : thesis 6, 34</ref> has its "most glaring superficial manifestation" in the [[advertising]]-[[mass media]]-[[marketing]] complex.<ref>Debord G.E. (1967) : thesis 24</ref>

Elaborating on Marx's argument that under capitalism our lives and our environment are continually depleted, Debord adds that the Spectacle is the system by which capitalism tries to hide such depletion. Debord added that, further than the impoverishment in the [[quality of life]],<ref name="PoliOntheReport"/><ref name="Debord1967QualityOfLife">Debord G.E. (1967) : thesis 6, 8, 10, 17, 19, 30, 37, 60, 68, 114, 134</ref> our psychic functions are altered, we get a degradation of mind and also a degradation of [[knowledge]].<ref>Debord G.E. (1967) : thesis 25, 192</ref> In the spectacular society, knowledge is not used anymore to question, analyze, or resolve [[contradiction]]s, but to assuage reality. Such argument on the Spectacle as a mask<ref name="DebordOnSpectacleRealUnity">''"The real unity the spectacle proclaims masks the class division on which the real unity of the capitalist mode of production is based."'' Debord G.E. (1967) : thesis 72.</ref> of a degrading reality has been elaborated by many Situationist artists, producing [[d<U+00E9>tournement]]s of advertising where instead of a shiny life the crude reality was represented. {{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

Situationist theorists advocated methods of operation that included [[worker's council|democratic workers' councils]] and [[Worker self-management|workers' self-management]],<ref>[http://www.notbored.org/debord-12March1969.html Guy Debord letter] to Italian section of the SI in Milan and to Mario Perniola in Rome,
12 March 1969</ref><ref>[http://www.notbored.org/debord-9December1969.html Guy Debord letter] to Paolo Salvadori 9 December [19]69</ref><ref>[http://www.notbored.org/debord-17March1970.html Guy Debord letter] To all the sections of the SI, [17 March 1970]</ref><ref>[http://www.notbored.org/debord-30July1969.html#_edn4 Guy Debord letter] To Rene Vienet, Wednesday 30 July [19]69</ref> interested in empowering the individual, in contrast to the perceived corrupt bureaucratic states of the [[Eastern bloc]]. Their anti-authoritarian interpretation of Marxist theory can be identified with the broader [[council communism|council communist]] and [[libertarian Marxism|libertarian Marxist]] movements, themselves more broadly termed as [[left communism]].

The last issue (1972) of the ''Situationist International'' journal, featured an editorial analyzing the events of [[May 1968 in France|May 1968]]. The editorial, written by [[Guy Debord]], was titled ''The Beginning of an Era'',<ref>[http://www.bopsecrets.org/SI/12.era1.htm ''The Beginning of an Era'']</ref> probably as a [[detournement]] reference of ''[[Nachalo]]'' (''The Beginning''), a Russian Marxist monthly magazine.

According to [[Greil Marcus]], some found similarities between the Situationists and the [[Yippies]].<ref>[[Greil Marcus]] ''The long walk of the Situationist International'' in McDonough (2004), ''Guy Debord and the Situationist International''</ref>

Former situationists Clark and Nicholson-Smith (British section), argued that the portion of the moderate Left that is the "established Left", and its "Left opinion-makers", usually addressed contemptuously the SI as 'hopelessly [[young-Hegelian]]'.<ref name="ClarkAndNSWinter97"/>

===Relationship with Anarchism===
The Situationist International was differentiated from both [[anarchist]]s and [[Marxist]]s. In spite of this, they have frequently been associated with anarchism.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Debord did a critical assessment of the anarchists in his 1967 ''[[The Society of the Spectacle]]''.<ref>Debord (1967) ''The Society of the Spectacle'', chap. 4 ''The Proletariat as Subject and as Representation'', theses 92-4</ref> In the final, 12th issue of the journal, Debord & co. rejected [[spontaneism]] and the "mystics of nonorganization," labeling them as a form of "sub-anarchism":<ref name="Riesel969">Riesel, Ren<U+00E9> [http://www.cddc.vt.edu/sionline/si/councils.html ''Preliminaries on Councils and Councilist Organization''], International Situationniste #12 (September 1969)</ref>

{{quotation|The only people who will be excluded from this debate are... those who in the name of some sub-anarchist spontaneism proclaim their opposition to any form of organization, and who only reproduce the defects and confusion of the old movement <U+2014> mystics of nonorganization, workers discouraged by having been mixed up with Trotskyist sects too long, students imprisoned in their impoverishment who are incapable of escaping from bolshevik organizational schemas. The situationists are obviously partisans of organization <U+2014> the existence of the situationist organization testifies to that. Those who announce their agreement with our theses while crediting the SI with a vague spontaneism simply don<U+2019>t know how to read.}}

According to situationist [[Ken Knabb]], Debord pointed out the flaws and merits of both Marxism and anarchism.<ref>http://www.bopsecrets.org/PS/joyrev2.htm#N_3_</ref> He argued that "the split between Marxism and anarchism crippled both sides. The anarchists rightly criticized the authoritarian and narrowly economistic tendencies in Marxism, but they generally did so in an undialectical, moralistic, ahistorical manner... and leaving Marx and a few of the more radical Marxists with a virtual monopoly on coherent dialectical analysis <U+2014> until the situationists finally brought the libertarian and dialectical aspects back together again."

===Relationship with the Established Left===
{{Cleanup|section|date=February 2011}}
{{Libertarian socialism |Philosophies}}
The S.I. poses a challenge to the model of political action of a portion of the Left,<ref name="ClarkEtAlSpring97">Clark and Nicholson-Smith (Spring 1997), response to [[Peter Wollen]]. Quotation: <blockquote>So far as Wollen is concerned, the anger was provoked by his essay on the history of the SI, and specifically his three-sentence treatment of the organization in its last decade. We think he should look again at these sentences (which conclude some thirty pages of discussion of the SI's place in modern art), and ask himself whether they are not lofty, contemptuous, and dismissive. That's how they read to us. They seem to epitomize<U+2014>and, in view of their publication history, to enshrine<U+2014>a certain effort to turn the SI safely into an [[art movement]], and thereby to minimize its role in the political and social movements of the sixties. Like Wollen, presumably, we think that those up-heavals are of much more than historical interest, and every day they are traduced and trivialized by the [[culture industry]]. Much is at stake, therefore. We wanted to denounce a loose conspirancy of silence and misrepresentation which has been the response of a portion of the Left to the challenge that the SI poses to their model of political action.</blockquote></ref> the "established Left" and "Left opinion-makers".<ref name="ClarkAndNSWinter97"/> The first challenging aspect is the fueling role that the S.I. had in the up-heavals of the political and social movements of the sixties,<ref name="BandiniImpactAndBoycott"/><ref name="Jappe99May68"/> up-heavals for which much is still at stake and which many foresee as recurring in the 21st century. The second challenging aspect,<ref name="BandiniImpactAndBoycott"/> is the comparison between the Situationists marxist theory of the [[Society of the Spectacle]], which is still very topical thirty years later,<ref name="Jappe99May68"/><ref name="Luttazzi2008"/> and the current status of the theories supported by the 'established Left' in the same period, like [[Althusserianism]], [[Maoism]], [[workerism]], [[Freudo-Marxism]] and others.<ref name="Jappe99May68"/>

The response of a portion of the Left to such challenge, has been an attempt to silence and misinterpret, to "turn the SI safely into an [[art movement]], and thereby to minimize its role in the political and social movements of the sixties."<ref name="BandiniImpactAndBoycott"/><ref name="ClarkEtAlSpring97"/>

The core aspect of the revolutionary perspectives, and the political theory, of the Situationist International, has been neglected by some commentators,<ref name="KnabbOnArtAndPolitics">Ken Knabb (2006) ''SI Anthology'', Bibliography - Books about the SI - In English, p.498</ref> which either limited themselves to an apolitical reading of the situationist [[avant-garde]] art works, or dismissed the Situationist political theory. Examples of this are [[Simon Sadler]]'s ''The Situationist City'',<ref name="KnabbOnArtAndPolitics"/> and the accounts on the S.I. published by the ''[[New Left Review]]''.<ref name="ClarkAndNSWinter97"/>

The concept of revolution created by the Situationist International was [[anti-capitalist]],<ref name="Gombin71SIAntiCapitalism"/><ref name="SI6DebordTapeRecord1961"/><ref name="SI8EditorialNotes"/> [[Marxist]], [[Young Hegelian]],<ref name="ClarkAndNSWinter97"/> and from the very beginning in the 50s, remarkably differently from the established Left, [[Anti-Stalinist left|anti-Stalinist]] and against all repressive regimes.<ref name="BandiniAntiStalisnism"/> The S.I. called in [[May 1968 in France|May 1968]] for the formation of [[Workers councils]],<ref name="SI12BeginningOfAnEra"/> and someone has argued that they were aligned with [[council communism]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

There was no separation between the artistic and the political perspectives.<ref name="BandiniArtAndPolitics"/> For instance, [[Asger Jorn]] never believed in a conception of the Situationist ideas as exclusively artistic and separated from political involvement. He was at the root and at the core of the Situationist International project, fully sharing the revolutionary intentions with Debord.<ref>[[Mario Lippolis]] (2000) ''Notizie su Asger Jorn, situazionista iperpolitico'' in {{Harvnb|Jorn|2000}}</ref><ref>Mario Lippolis (2000) ''Un dialogo tra vandali civilizzatori nello sfacelo dell<U+2019>impero della merce'' in {{Harvnb|Jorn|2000}}</ref>

Critics of the Situationists frequently assert that their ideas are not in fact complex and difficult to understand, but are at best simple ideas expressed in deliberately difficult language, and at worst actually nonsensical. For example, anarchist [[Chaz Bufe]] asserts in [[Listen Anarchist!]] that "obscure situationist jargon" is a major problem in the anarchist movement.<ref>{{cite web | title=[[Listen Anarchist!]] | author=Chaz Bufe | url=http://www.seesharppress.com/listen.html | publisher=See Sharp Press | date=| accessdate=2008-06-23}}</ref>

===Influence===
{{Refimprove section|date=March 2009}}
Situationist ideas have continued to echo through many aspects of culture and politics in Europe and the USA. Even in their own time, with limited translations of their dense theoretical texts,{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} combined with their very successful self-mythologisation, the term "situationist" was often used to refer to any rebel or outsider, rather than to a body of surrealist-inspired Marxist critical theory.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} As such, the terms "Situationist," "spectacle," and "detournement" have often been decontextualised and recuperated.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Debord's analysis of the spectacle has been influential among people working on television, particularly in France and Italy;<ref name="BlissettNuncEstBibendum95"/><ref name="Derrida02Q&A">Derrida (2002) Q&A session at Film Forum pp.116-7 quote: {{quotation|I think you probably know that his work [Debord's] is read now more than when he was alive. At least that's the case in France. I don't know if he's read in the States, but in France he's read as presenting a precise critique and political analysis of the media, of the becoming-spectacle, the exploitation of the 'show' in politics and in the media, and television.

What's interesting is that in France people, especially the writers or the intellectuals who are often asked to appear on TV - sometimes almost every day -- they [reflexively] mention Guy Debord as their master, and I hate this! So I never quote Debord when I'm on TV, and I'm almost never on TV - so I guess that's how, in my way, I'm true to Debord.}}</ref> in Italy, TV programs produced by situationist intellectuals, like [[Antonio Ricci]]'s ''[[Striscia la notizia]]'', or Carlo Freccero's programming schedule for ''[[Italia 1]]'' in the early 1990s.<ref name="BlissettNuncEstBibendum95">[[Luther Blissett (nom de plume)|Luther Blissett]] (2002) [1995] ''Guy Debord Is Really Dead'', Sabotage Editions, ISBN 978-0-9514417-3-2 English edition of ''[http://www.scienzepostmoderne.org/DiversiAutori/Debord/DebordMortoDavvero.html Guy Debord <U+00E8> morto davvero]''</ref>

In the 1960s and 1970s, anarchists, communists, and other leftists offered various interpretations of Situationist concepts in combination with a variety of other perspectives. Examples of these groups include: in Amsterdam, the [[Provo (movement)|Provos]]; in the UK, [[King Mob]], the producers of ''Heatwave'' magazine (who later briefly joined the SI), and the [[Angry Brigade]]. In the US, groups like [[Black Mask (anarchists)|Black Mask]] (later [[Up Against the Wall Motherfuckers]]), [[Weatherman (organization)|The Weathermen]], and the [[Chicago Surrealist Group|Rebel Worker]] group also explicitly employed their ideas.<ref name="Lang 2007">{{cite journal | last=Lang | first=Daniel | title="Give Us the Dumpsters -Or- Give Us Life": Res Derilictae and the Trash of Free Trade | journal=Cultural Recycling | volume=3 | issue=1 | month=May | year=2007 | publisher=[[Other Voices (open-access journal of cultural criticism)|Other Voices]] | url=http://www.othervoices.org/3.1/dlang/index.php}}</ref>

Anarchist theorists such as [[Fredy Perlman]], [[Bob Black]], [[Hakim Bey]], and [[John Zerzan]], have developed the SI's ideas in various directions away from Marxism. These theorists were predominantly associated with the magazines ''[[Fifth Estate]]'', ''[[Anarchy: A Journal of Desire Armed]]'', and ''[[Green Anarchy]]''. During the early 1980s, English anarchist Larry Law produced the ''Spectacular Times'' pocket-books series, which aimed to make Situationist ideas more easily assimilated into the anarchist movement. Later anarchist theorists such as the [[CrimethInc.]] collective also claim Situationist influence.<ref name="Lang 2007"/>

Situationist urban theory, defined initially by the members of the [[Lettrist International]] as "Unitary Urbanism," was extensively developed through the behavioural and performance structures of [[The Workshop for Non-Linear Architecture]] during the 1990s. The re-emergence of the [[London Psychogeographical Association]] also inspired many new psychogeographical groups including Manchester Area Psychogeographic. The LPA and the [[Neoist Alliance]] along with the [[Luther Blissett (nom de plume)|Luther Blissett]] Project came together to form a New [[Lettrist International]] with a specifically [[Communist]] perspective. Around this time, [[Unpopular Books]] and the LPA released some key texts including new translations of [[Asger Jorn]]'s work.

Around this time also, groups such as [[Reclaim the Streets]] and [[Adbusters]] have, respectively, seen themselves as "creating situations" or practicing detournement on advertisements.

In cultural terms, the SI's influence has arguably been greater, if more diffuse. The list of cultural practices which claim a debt to the SI is extensive, but there are some prominent examples:
* Situationist ideas exerted a strong influence on the design language of the [[punk rock]] phenomenon of the 1970s. To a significant extent this came about due to the adoption of the style and aesthetics and sometimes slogans employed by the SI. These were often second hand, via English pro-Situ groups such as [[King Mob]] whose associates included [[Malcolm McClaren]] and [[Jamie Reid]]. [[Factory Records]] owner [[Tony Wilson]] was influenced by Situationist [[The Ha<U+00E7>ienda|urbanism]] and Factory Records band [[The Durutti Column]] took its name from Andre Bertrand's collage ''Le Retour de la Colonne Durutti''.<ref>{{cite web | title=Le Retour de la Colonne Durutti | author=| url=http://www.cerysmaticfactory.info/durutti_le_retour_66.html | publisher=Cerysmatic Factory | accessdate=2007-10-23}}</ref> (Bertrand, in turn, took his title from the eponymous [[Durruti Column|anarchist army]] during the [[Spanish Civil War]]). U.S. punk group The [[Feederz]] have been acclaimed as exhibiting a more direct and conscious influence. Formed in the late 1970s, they became known for extensive use of detournement and their intention to provoke their audience through the exposition of Situationist themes.<ref>{{cite web | title=The Situationist International in American Hardcore Punk, 1982-2002 | author=Neil Nehring | url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/911505403-40919005/content~content=a758328513~tab=send | publisher=Popular Music & Society | date=December 2006 | accessdate=2008-06-23}}</ref> Other musical artists whose lyrics and artwork have referenced Situationist concepts include: [[The Love Kills Theory]], [[Chumbawamba]], [[Manic Street Preachers]], [[Nation of Ulysses]], [[Huggy Bear (band)|Huggy Bear]], [[Joan of Arc (band)|Joan of Arc]], [[The Spectacle]], [[International Noise Conspiracy]] and [[Refused]]. Situationist theory experienced a vogue in the late '90s [[hardcore punk]] scene, being referenced by [[Orchid (band)|Orchid]], [[His Hero Is Gone]], and [[CrimethInc.]].
* One can also trace situationist ideas within the development of other avant-garde threads such as [[Neoism]], as well as artists such as [[Mark Divo]].
* Some hacker related e-zines, which, like [[samizdat]], were distributed via email and [[FTP]] over early [[Internet]] links and [[Bulletin board system|BBS]] quoted and developed ideas coming from SI. A few of them were N0 Way, N0 Route, UHF, in France; and early [[Phrack]], [[Cult of the Dead Cow|cDc]] in the US. More recently, writers such as [[Thomas de Zengotita]] have echoed Situationist theories regarding the [[Mediated: How the Media Shapes your World and the Way you Live in it|spectacle]] of contemporary society.
