{{Indo-European topics}}
The '''Proto-Indo-European language''' ('''PIE''') is the [[linguistic reconstruction|reconstructed]] common ancestor of the [[Indo-European languages]], spoken by the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans]]. PIE was the first proposed proto-language to be widely accepted by linguists. Far more work has gone into reconstructing it than any other proto-language, and it is by far the most well-understood of all proto-languages at its time depth. During the 19th century, the vast majority of linguistic work was devoted to reconstruction of Proto-Indo-European or of daughter proto-languages such as [[Proto-Germanic]], and most of the current techniques of [[historical linguistics]] (e.g. the [[comparative method]] and the method of [[internal reconstruction]]) were developed as a specific result.

Scholars estimate that PIE may have been spoken as a single language (before divergence began) around 3700 BC, though estimates by different authorities can vary by more than a millennium. The most popular hypothesis for the origin and spread of the language is the [[Kurgan hypothesis]], which postulates an origin in the [[Pontic-Caspian steppe]] of Eastern Europe.

The existence of PIE was first postulated in the 18th century by Sir [[William Jones (philologist)|William Jones]], who observed the similarities between [[Sanskrit]], [[Ancient Greek]], and [[Latin language|Latin]]. By the early 20th century, well-defined descriptions of PIE had been developed that are still accepted today (with some refinements).  The largest developments of the 20th century have been the discovery of [[Anatolian languages|Anatolian]] and [[Tocharian languages]] and the acceptance of the [[laryngeal theory]].  The Anatolian languages have also spurred a major re-evaluation of theories concerning the development of various shared Indo-European language features and the extent to which these features were present in PIE itself.

PIE is thought to have had a complex system of [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] that included [[Fusional language|inflections]] (suffixing of roots, as in ''who, whom, whose''), and [[Indo-European ablaut|ablaut]] (vowel alterations, as in ''sing, sang, sung''). Nouns used a sophisticated system of [[declension]] and verbs used a similarly sophisticated system of [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugation]].

Relationships to other language families, including the [[Uralic languages]], have been proposed but remain controversial.

There is no written evidence of Proto-Indo-European, so all knowledge of the language is derived by reconstruction from later languages using linguistic techniques such as the [[comparative method]] and the method of [[internal reconstruction]].

===Historical and geographical setting===
{{Main|Proto-Indo-European Urheimat hypotheses}}
There are several competing hypotheses about when and where PIE was spoken. The [[Kurgan hypothesis]] is "the single most popular" model,{{Sfn |Mallory|1989|p=185 | ps =: <U+2018>The Kurgan solution is attractive and has been accepted by many [[archaeologists]]  and linguists, in part or total.

The [[satemization]] process that resulted in the [[Centum-Satem isogloss]] probably started as early as the [[4th millennium BC]]<ref name =Kortlandt>{{Citation | quote = ...the satemization process can be dated to the last centuries of the fourth millennium | format = PDF | url = http://www.kortlandt.nl/publications/art111e.pdf | place = [[Netherlands|NL]] | title = The spread of the Indo-Europeans | first = Frederik | last = Kortlandt}}</ref> and the only thing known for certain is that the proto language must have been differentiated into unconnected daughter dialects by the late [[3rd millennium BC]]. 

Mainstream linguistic estimates of the time between PIE and the earliest attested texts (ca. [[19th century BC|nineteenth century BC]]; see [[K<U+00FC>ltepe|K<U+00FC>ltepe texts]]) range around 1,500 to 2,500 years, with extreme proposals diverging up to another 100% on either side.  Proposed models include:

* the [[5th millennium BC]] ([[4th millennium BC|4th]] excluding the Anatolian branch) in the [[Pontic-Caspian steppe]], according to [[Marija Gimbutas]]'s [[Kurgan hypothesis]];

===History===
{{Main|Indo-European studies}}
Indo-European studies began with Sir [[William Jones (philologist)|William Jones]] making and propagating the observation that [[Sanskrit]] bore a certain resemblance to classical [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]]. In ''The Sanscrit Language'' (1786) he suggested that all three languages had a common root, and that indeed they might further all be related, in turn, to [[Gothic language|Gothic]] and the [[Celtic languages]], as well as to [[Persian language|Persian]]. 

His third annual discourse before the Asiatic Society on the history and culture of the Hindus (delivered on 2 February 1786 and published in 1788) with the famed "philologer" passage is often cited as the beginning of [[historical linguistics|comparative linguistics]] and [[Indo-European studies]]. This is Jones' most quoted passage, establishing his tremendous find in the history of linguistics: 

{{quote|The ''Sanscrit'' language, whatever be its antiquity, is of a wonderful structure; more perfect than the ''Greek'', more copious than the ''Latin'', and more exquisitely refined than either, yet bearing to both of them a stronger affinity, both in the roots of verbs and the forms of grammar, than could possibly have been produced by accident; so strong indeed, that no philologer could examine them all three, without believing them to have sprung from some common source, which, perhaps, no longer exists; there is a similar reason, though not quite so forcible, for supposing that both the ''Gothic'' and the ''Celtic'', though blended with a very different idiom, had the same origin with the ''Sanscrit''; and the old ''Persian'' might be added to the same family.}}

This common source came to be known as Proto-Indo-European.

The classical phase of Indo-European [[comparative linguistics]] leads from [[Franz Bopp]]'s ''Comparative Grammar'' (1833) to [[August Schleicher]]'s 1861 ''Compendium'' and up to [[Karl Brugmann]]'s ''[[Grundriss der vergleichenden Grammatik der indogermanischen Sprachen|Grundriss]]'' published from the 1880s. Brugmann's ''[[Junggrammatiker|junggrammatic]]'' re-evaluation of the field and [[Ferdinand de Saussure]]'s development of the [[laryngeal theory]] may be considered the beginning of "contemporary" Indo-European studies. 

PIE as described in the early 20th century is still generally accepted today; subsequent work is largely refinement and systematization, as well as the incorporation of new information, such as the [[Anatolian languages|Anatolian]] and [[Tocharian languages|Tocharian]] branches unknown in the 19th century.

The [[laryngeal theory]], in its early forms discussed since the 1880s, became mainstream after [[Jerzy Kury<U+0142>owicz]]'s 1927 discovery of the survival of at least some of these hypothetical phonemes in Anatolian.

[[Julius Pokorny]]'s landmark ''[[Indogermanisches etymologisches W<U+00F6>rterbuch]]'' ("Indo-European Etymological Dictionary", 1959) gave a detailed overview of the lexical knowledge accumulated up until that time, but neglected contemporary trends of morphology and phonology (including the laryngeal theory), and largely ignored Anatolian. 

The generation of Indo-Europeanists active in the last third of the 20th century (such as [[Calvert Watkins]], [[Jochem Schindler]] and [[Helmut Rix]]) developed a better understanding of morphology and, in the wake of Kury<U+0142>owicz's 1956 ''Apophonie'', understanding of the [[Indo-European ablaut|ablaut]]. From the 1960s, knowledge of Anatolian became certain enough to establish its relationship to PIE; see also [[Indo-Hittite]].

===Method===
{{Main|Historical linguistics|Indo-European sound laws}}
There is no direct evidence of PIE, because it was never [[written language|written]]. All PIE sounds and words are reconstructed from later Indo-European languages using the [[comparative method]] and the method of [[internal reconstruction]]. An [[asterisk]] is used to mark reconstructed PIE words, such as *''{{unicode|w<U+00F3>dr<U+0325>}}'' '[[water]]', *''{{unicode|<U+1E31>w<U+1E53>n}}'' '[[dog]]' (English ''hound''), or *''{{unicode|tr<U+00E9>yes}}'' 'three (masculine)'. Many of the words in the modern Indo-European languages seem to have derived from such "protowords" via regular [[sound change]]s (e.g., [[Grimm's law]]).

As the Proto-Indo-European language broke up, its sound system diverged as well, according to various [[sound law]]s in the daughter languages. Notable among these are [[Grimm's law]] and [[Verner's law]] in [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]], loss of prevocalic ''*p-'' in [[Proto-Celtic language|Proto-Celtic]], reduction to ''h'' of prevocalic ''*s-'' in [[Proto-Greek language|Proto-Greek]], [[Brugmann's law]] and [[Bartholomae's law]] in [[Proto-Indo-Iranian]], [[Grassmann's law]] independently in both Proto-Greek and Proto-Indo-Iranian, and [[Winter's law]] and [[Hirt's law]] in [[Balto-Slavic languages|Balto-Slavic]].

===Relationships to other language families===

====Proposed genetic connections====

Many higher-level relationships between Proto-Indo-European and other language families have been proposed, but these hypothesized connections are highly controversial. A proposal often considered to be the most plausible of these is that of an [[Indo-Uralic languages|Indo-Uralic]] family, encompassing PIE and [[Uralic languages|Uralic]]. The evidence usually cited in favor of this consists in a number of striking morphological and lexical resemblances. Opponents attribute the lexical resemblances to borrowing from Indo-European into Uralic. [[Frederik Kortlandt]], while advocating a connection, concedes that "the gap between Uralic and Indo-European is huge", while [[Lyle Campbell]], an authority on [[Uralic]], denies any relationship exists. 

Other proposals, further back in time (and proportionately less accepted), link Indo-European and Uralic with [[Altaic languages|Altaic]] and the other language families of northern Eurasia, namely [[Yukaghir languages|Yukaghir]], [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Chukotko-Kamchatkan languages|Chukotko-Kamchatkan]], [[Nivkh language|Nivkh]], [[Ainu language|Ainu]], and [[Eskimo<U+2013>Aleut languages|Eskimo<U+2013>Aleut]], but excluding [[Yeniseian languages|Yeniseian]] (the most comprehensive such proposal is [[Joseph Greenberg]]'s [[Eurasiatic languages|Eurasiatic]]), or link Indo-European, Uralic, and Altaic to [[Afro-Asiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]] and [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]] (the traditional form of the [[Nostratic languages|Nostratic]] hypothesis), and ultimately to a single [[Proto-Human language|Proto-Human]] family. 

A more rarely mentioned proposal associates Indo-European with the [[Northwest Caucasian languages]] in a family called [[Proto-Pontic language|Proto-Pontic]]. 

[[Etruscan language|Etruscan]] shows some similarities to Indo-European, such as a genitive in ''-s''. There is no consensus on whether these are due to a genetic relationship, borrowing, chance and [[sound symbolism]], or some combination of these.

====Proposed areal connections====

'''Alternative notations:''' The aspirated stops are sometimes written as {{PIE|*bh, *dh, *<U+01F5>h, *gh, *g<U+02B7>h}}; for the palatals, {{PIE|*k<U+0311>, *g<U+0311>}} are often used; and {{PIE|*i<U+032F>, *u<U+032F>}} can replace {{PIE|*j, *w}}.

'''IPA note:''' The notation used above is traditional in Indo-European studies, but should not necessarily be interpreted as the corresponding IPA values. Most saliently, ''{{PIE|*y}}'' is traditionally used to represent IPA /j/, not any sort of front-rounded vowel. In addition, the traditional names and symbols for the dorsals and laryngeals should not be taken as more than a vague suggestion of their actual values.

The following are the main characteristics of PIE consonants:
*PIE had a large number of [[stop consonant|stop]]s, but few [[fricative]]s.  The traditional (pre-laryngeal) reconstruction included only one fricative, /s/; however, the modern theory includes three additional fricatives, commonly known as [[laryngeal theory|laryngeals]] and assumed to have been pronounced far back in the mouth (i.e. [[Fricative consonant#Central non-sibilant fricatives|velar]], [[uvular fricative|uvular]], [[pharyngeal consonant|pharyngeal]] and/or [[glottal fricative|glottal]]).  Laryngeals disappeared from all PIE languages except (to some extent) the [[Anatolian language]]s, but reveal themselves in their effects on nearby sounds.  For example, short ''*e'' adjacent to ''*h<U+2082>'' and ''*h<U+2083>'' is colored to ''*a'' and ''*o'', respectively, and short vowels preceding a laryngeal are usually lengthened. The exact [[Laryngeal theory#Pronunciation|pronunciation of the laryngeals]] is disputed; some linguists have even asserted that /*h<U+2081>/ might not have been a fricative at all, but a [[glottal stop]].
*Both the number of [[dorsal consonant]]s (''k''-type sounds, i.e. stops pronounced in the back of the mouth) and their actual pronunciation are sources of controversy.  In particular, the existence of the "plain velar" series as phonemically distinct consonants has long been a source of contention.  The traditional theory, which most linguists still adhere to, calls for three series of dorsals, traditionally termed "[[palatovelar]]", "[[velar|plain velar]]" and "[[Labialized velar consonant|labiovelar]]". These terms should be viewed as notional rather than expressing any particular commitment to the actual pronunciation of the sounds: in particular, a number of linguists<ref name = "huld">{{Citation | contribution = Sat<U+0259>m, Centum, and Hokum | first = Martin E | last = Huld | year = 1997 | title = Festschrift for Eric P. Hamp | editor-first = Douglas Q | editor-last = Adams | pages = 115<U+2013>38}}</ref>{{Sfn | Clackson | 2007 | p = 52}}{{Sfn | Ringe | 2006}}{{Rp | needed = yes |date= November 2012}} have argued that the pronunciations implied by the traditional terms are unlikely given later developments, and that a more likely pronunciation was as plain velar, [[uvular consonant|uvular]], and [[labialization|labialized]] velar, respectively.  The dispute over the status of the traditional plain velar series concerns the fact that this is the least-common series; is mostly confined to specific environments (e.g. before /a/ or /r/), and the palatovelar series is not often found in these same environments; and is reflected identically to one of the other two series in all, or nearly all, of the daughters.  This has led some linguists to reconstruct only two series, with the distinction between "palatovelar" and "plain velar" a secondary distinction that arose as an [[areal feature]] in some of the daughters (especially the "[[satem]]" languages).
*PIE is traditionally reconstructed with three types of [[voice (phonetics)|voicing]]s for its stops: [[voiceless consonant|voiceless]], [[voiced consonant|voiced]], and [[breathy voice|breathy-voiced]] (traditionally termed "voiced aspirated"). This is typologically uncommon, and in fact the reconstructed breathy-voiced series appears as such only in [[Indo-Aryan languages]].  Thus, some linguists have proposed the [[glottalic theory]], which proposes a very different reconstruction of these three series. However, this theory is not widely accepted today.
*A notable characteristic is that the [[sonorant|resonant]]s /r/, /l/, /m/, /n/, /y/ and /w/ could appear as vowels as well as consonants, specifically when not adjacent to another vowel.  The same is usually held to be true of the laryngeals, as well.  This has led to some dispute as to whether PIE should be reconstructed with phonemes /i/ and /u/, or whether these should be considered [[allophone]]s of /y/ and /w/; however, there is some evidence that /i/, at least, could occur in the same environments as /y/.

===Vowels===
Generally accepted:
* '''Short vowel phonemes''': {{PIE|*e}}, {{PIE|*o}}.
* '''Long vowel phonemes''': {{PIE |*<U+0113>}}, {{PIE |*<U+014D>}}. Sometimes a colon (:) is employed instead of the macron sign to indicate [[vowel length]] (*e:, *o:).
* '''[[Diphthong]]s''': {{PIE|*ei, *eu, *<U+0113>i, *<U+0113>u, *oi, *ou, *<U+014D>i, *<U+014D>u}}. Diphthongs are sometimes understood as combinations of a vowel plus a semivowel, e. g. *ey or {{PIE|*ei<U+032F>}} instead of *ei.{{Sfn | Rix | 2001}}{{Rp | needed = yes|date=November 2012}}
* '''Vocalic allophones''': {{PIE|*a}} (underlying {{PIE|*e}} adjacent to {{PIE|*h<U+2082>}}); {{PIE|*i, *u, *m<U+0325>, *n<U+0325>, *l<U+0325>, *r<U+0325>}} (underlying resonant consonants when not adjacent to a vowel); {{PIE|*h<U+0325><U+2081>, *h<U+0325><U+2082>, *h<U+0325><U+2083>}} (underlying laryngeal consonants when not adjacent to a vowel).

Sometimes suggested:
* independent {{PIE|*a}} and possibly {{PIE|*<U+0101>}}
* independent {{PIE|*i}} and possibly {{PIE|*u}}
* phonemes or allophones due to [[compensatory lengthening]] triggered by laryngeal loss already in the proto-language (e.g. due to [[Stang's law]]), potentially including: {{PIE|*a}}, {{PIE|*<U+0101>}} (separate from possible independent occurrences); long variants of vocalic allophones ({{PIE|*m<U+0325><U+0304>, *n<U+0325><U+0304>, *l<U+0325><U+0304>, *r<U+0325><U+0304>, *<U+012B>, *<U+016B>}}); ''a''-quality diphthongs (*ai, *au, *<U+0101>i, *<U+0101>u, separate from possible independent occurrences)
* possibly, rare phonemes {{PIE|*<U+012B>}}, {{PIE|*<U+016B>}}.

The potential existence of independent {{PIE|*a}} (and possibly {{PIE|*<U+0101>}}) is a particular source or dispute  It is often suggested that all {{PIE|*a}} were earlier derived from an {{PIE|*e}} preceded or followed by {{PIE|*h<U+2082>}}, but [[Manfred Mayrhofer|Mayrhofer]],{{Sfn | Mayrhofer | 1986 | pp = 170<U+202F>ff}}  [[Donald Ringe|Ringe]]{{Sfn | Ringe | 2006}}{{Rp | needed = yes|date= November 2012}} and a number of others have argued that PIE did in fact have the phoneme {{PIE |*a}} (and possibly also {{PIE|*<U+0101>}}) independent of {{PIE |h<U+2082>}}.

===Accent===
{{Main|Proto-Indo-European accent}}
PIE had a free [[pitch accent]], which could appear on any syllable and whose position often varied among different members of a paradigm (e.g. between singular and plural of a verbal paradigm, or between nominative/accusative and oblique cases of a nominal paradigm).  The location of the pitch accent is closely associated with [[Indo-European ablaut|ablaut]] variations, especially between normal-grade vowels (/e/ and /o/) and zero-grade vowels (i.e. lack of a vowel).  The accent is best preserved in [[Vedic Sanskrit]] and (in the case of nouns) [[Ancient Greek]], and indirectly attested in a number of phenomena in other PIE languages.

==Morphology==

===Root===
{{Main|Proto-Indo-European root}}

PIE was an [[inflected language]], in which the grammatical relationships between words were signaled through inflectional morphemes (usually endings). The [[root (linguistics)|roots]] of PIE are basic [[morpheme]]s carrying a [[lexical]] meaning. By addition of [[suffix]]es, they form [[stem (linguistics)|stems]], and by addition of [[desinence]]s (usually endings), these form grammatically inflected [[word]]s ([[noun]]s or [[verb]]s). PIE roots are understood to be predominantly monosyllabic with a basic shape CvC(C). This basic root shape is often altered by [[Indo-European ablaut|ablaut]]. Roots which appear to be vowel initial are believed by many scholars to have originally begun with a set of consonants, later lost in all but the [[Anatolian languages|Anatolian]] branch, called [[laryngeals]] (usually indicated {{PIE|''*H''}}, and often specified with a subscript number {{PIE|''*h<U+2081>, *h<U+2082>, *h<U+2083>''}}). Thus a verb form such as the one reflected in Latin {{lang|la|''agunt''}}, Greek {{lang|grc|<U+1F04><U+03B3><U+03BF><U+03C5><U+03C3><U+03B9>}} (''<U+00E1>gousi''), Sanskrit {{IAST|''ajanti''}} would be reconstructed as {{PIE|''*h<U+2082>e<U+01F5>-onti''}}, with the element {{PIE|*''h<U+2082>e<U+01F5>-''}} constituting the root ''per se''.

===Ablaut===
{{Main|Indo-European ablaut}}
An important component of PIE [[morphophonology]] is the variation in vowels commonly termed ''ablaut'', which occurred both within [[inflectional morphology]] (among different members of a nominal or verbal paradigm) and [[derivational morphology]] (between, for example, a verb and an associated [[verbal noun]]).  Ablaut in PIE was closely associated with the position of the accent; for example, the alternation found in Latin ''est, sunt'' reflects PIE {{PIE|*''h<U+2081><U+00E9>s-ti, *h<U+2081>s-<U+00F3>nti''}}. However, it is not possible to derive either one directly from the other.  The primary ablaut variation was between ''normal grade'' or ''full grade'' ({{PIE|*/e/}} and {{PIE|*/o/}}), ''lengthened grade'' ({{PIE|*/<U+0113>/}} and {{PIE|*/<U+014D>/}}), and ''zero grade'' (lack of a vowel, which triggered the vocalic allophones of nearby resonants).  The normal grade is often characterized as ''e-grade'' or ''o-grade'' depending on the particular vowel involved.  Ablaut occurred both in the root and the ending.  Originally, morphological categories were distinguished both by  ablaut variations and different endings, but the decay of endings has led some languages to use ablaut alone to distinguish grammatical categories, as in the Modern English words ''sing, sang, sung'', originally reflecting a pre-Proto-Germanic sequence ''*sengw-, *songw-, *sngw-''. Some scholars{{who|date=December 2010}} believe that the inflectional affixes of Indo European reflect ablaut variants, usually [[Indo-European ablaut#Zero grade|zero-grade]], of older PIE roots. Often the zero-grade appears where the word's accent has shifted from the root to one of the affixes.

===Noun===
{{Main|Proto-Indo-European nominals}}
Proto-Indo-European nouns were declined for eight or nine cases ([[nominative]], [[Accusative case|accusative]], [[genitive]], [[Dative case|dative]], [[Instrumental case|instrumental]], [[ablative]], [[locative]], [[vocative]], and possibly a directive or [[allative]]).{{Sfn | Fortson | 2004 | p = 102}}  There were three genders: masculine, feminine, and neuter.

There are two major types of declension, [[thematic and athematic]]. Thematic nominal stems are formed with a suffix {{PIE|''*-o-''}} (in vocative {{PIE|''*-e''}}) and the stem does not undergo [[Indo-European ablaut|ablaut]]. The athematic stems are more archaic, and they are classified further by their ablaut behaviour (''acrostatic'', ''proterokinetic'', ''hysterokinetic'' and ''amphikinetic'', after the positioning of the early PIE accent in the paradigm).

===Pronoun===
{{Main|Proto-Indo-European pronouns}}
PIE pronouns are difficult to reconstruct owing to their variety in later languages.  This is especially the case for [[demonstrative pronoun]]s. PIE had personal [[pronoun]]s in the [[grammatical person|first and second person]], but not the third person, where demonstratives were used instead. The personal pronouns had their own unique forms and endings, and some had [[Suppletion|two distinct stems]]; this is most obvious in the first person singular, where the two stems are still preserved in English ''I'' and ''me''.  According to Beekes,{{Sfn | Beekes | 1995}}{{Rp | needed = yes|date=November 2012}} there were also two varieties for the accusative, genitive and dative cases, a stressed and an [[enclitic]] form.

As for demonstratives, Beekes tentatively reconstructs a system with only two pronouns: {{PIE|''*so'' / ''*seh<U+2082>'' / ''*tod''}} "this, that" and {{PIE |''*h<U+2081>e'' / ''*(h<U+2081>)ih<U+2082>'' / ''*(h<U+2081>)id''}} "the (just named)" ([[Anaphora (linguistics)|anaphoric]]). He also postulates three adverbial particles {{PIE |''*<U+1E31>i''}} "here", {{PIE|''*h<U+2082>en''}} "there" and {{PIE|''*h<U+2082>eu''}} "away, again", from which demonstratives were constructed in various later languages.

===Verb===<!-- This section is linked from [[Vedic Sanskrit grammar]] -->
{{Main|Proto-Indo-European verbs}}
The Indo-European [[verb]] system is complex and, like the noun, exhibits a system of [[Indo-European ablaut|ablaut]]. The most basic categorization for the Indo-European verb was [[grammatical aspect]]. Verbs were classed as ''[[stative verb|stative]]'' (verbs that depict a state of being), ''[[imperfective aspect|imperfective]]'' (verbs depicting ongoing, habitual or repeated action) or ''[[perfective aspect|perfective]]'' (verbs depicting a completed action or actions viewed as an entire process). Verbs have at least four [[Grammatical mood|moods]] ([[indicative mood|indicative]], [[imperative mood|imperative]], [[subjunctive mood|subjunctive]] and [[optative mood|optative]], as well as possibly the [[injunctive mood|injunctive]], reconstructible from Vedic Sanskrit), two [[Grammatical voice|voices]] ([[active voice|active]] and [[mediopassive voice|mediopassive]]), as well as three [[Grammatical person|persons]] (first, second and third) and three [[Grammatical number|numbers]] ([[Grammatical number|singular]], [[dual grammatical number|dual]] and [[plural]]). Verbs were also marked by a highly developed system of [[participle]]s, one for each combination of tense and mood, and an assorted array of [[verbal noun]]s and adjectival formations.

The following table shows two possible reconstructions of the PIE verb endings.  Sihler's reconstruction largely represents the current consensus among Indo-Europeanists, while Beekes' is a radical rethinking of thematic verbs; although not widely accepted, it is included to show an example of more far-reaching recent research.

===Particle===
{{Main|Proto-Indo-European particles}}

Many particles could be used both as [[adverbs]] and [[postpositions]], like {{PIE|''*upo''}} "under, below". The postpositions became prepositions in most daughter languages. Other reconstructible particles include [[Negation (linguistics)|negators]] ({{PIE|''*ne, *m<U+0113>''}}), [[Grammatical conjunction|conjunctions]] ({{PIE|''*k<U+02B7>e''}} "and", {{PIE|''*w<U+0113>''}} "or" and others) and an [[interjection]] ({{PIE|''*wai!''}}, an expression of woe or agony).

==Sample texts==

As PIE was spoken by a prehistoric society, no genuine sample texts are available, but since the 19th century modern scholars have made various attempts to compose example texts for purposes of illustration. These texts are educated guesses at best; [[Calvert Watkins]] in 1969 observes that in spite of its 150 years' history, comparative linguistics is not in the position to reconstruct a single well-formed sentence in PIE. Nevertheless, such texts do have the merit of giving an impression of what a coherent utterance in PIE might have sounded like.

Published PIE sample texts:
* [[Schleicher's fable]] (''{{unicode|Avis akvasas ka}}'') by [[August Schleicher]] (1868), modernized by [[Hermann Hirt]] (1939) and [[Winfred Lehmann]] and [[Ladislav Zgusta]] (1979)
* [[The king and the god]] (''{{unicode|r<U+0113><U+1E31>s deiwos-k<U+02B7>e}}'') by S. K. Sen, E. P. Hamp et al. (1994)

== In popular culture ==
PIE in used in dialogue between humans and aliens in [[Ridley Scott]]'s movie ''[[Prometheus (film)|''Prometheus'' (film)]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=4008 |title=Language Log <U+00BB> Proto-Indo-European in Prometheus? |publisher=Languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu |date=2012-06-08 |accessdate=2013-03-12}}</ref>  In one scene, an android studies [[Schleicher's fable]].

==Daughter language groupings==

===Generally accepted subfamilies (clades)===
* [[Proto-Albanian language]]
* [[Proto-Anatolian language]]
* [[Proto-Armenian language]]
* [[Proto-Balto-Slavic language]]
* [[Proto-Celtic language]]
* [[Proto-Germanic language]]
* [[Proto-Greek language]]
* [[Proto-Indo-Iranian language]]
* [[Proto-Italic language]]
* [[Proto-Tocharian language]]

===Marginally attested languages===
These include languages that do not appear to be members of any of the above families, but which are so poorly attested that proper classification of them is not possible.  Of these languages, [[Phrygian language|Phrygian]] is easily the best-attested.

* [[Phrygian language]]
* [[Dacian language]]
* [[Thracian language]]
* [[Illyrian language]]
* [[Venetic language]]
* [[Messapic language]]
* [[Ancient Macedonian language]]
* [[Lusitanian language]]

All of the above languages except for Lusitanian (which occurs in the area of modern [[Portugal]]) occur in or near the [[Balkan peninsula]], and have been collectively termed the "[[Paleo-Balkan languages]]".  This is a purely geographic grouping and makes no claims about the relatedness of the languages to each other as compared with other Indo-European languages.

===Hypothetical clades===
* [[Italo-Celtic]]
* [[Graeco-Aryan]]
* [[Graeco-Armenian]]
* [[Daco-Thracian]]
* [[Thraco-Illyrian]]
