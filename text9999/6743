Bernegger's [[Protestant]] family was, like other so called ''exulanten'', expelled from [[Habsburg Austria]] during the [[counter reformation]]. They settled in [[Regensburg]], where Bernegger visited the Gymnasium. In 1599, the 17-year-old began studies in [[University of Strassburg|Strassburg]], mainly in the fields of [[philology]] and [[natural sciences]]. He was fascinated by [[astronomy]] and was in contact with [[Johannes Kepler]] and [[Wilhelm Schickard]].

Already in 1612,<ref name="Woll" /> Bernegger had translated a 1606 Italian language work of [[Galileo Galilei]]'s into Latin, as ''Tractatus de proportionum instrumento''.<ref>Tractatus de proportionum instrumento: quod merito compendium vniuers<U+00E6> geometri<U+00E6> dixeris [http://books.google.com/books?id=L2AaNAAACAAJ&dq=%22tractatus+de+proportionum%22]</ref>

In 1632, via their mutual friend [[Elia Diodati]], Galilei asked Bernegger to translate his Italian language ''Dialogo'' ([[Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems]]) into Latin. In order to protect Galilei's involvement, it was stated<ref name="Woll">Siegfried Wollgast: ''Philosophie in Deutschland zwischen Reformation und Aufkl<U+00E4>rung, 1550-1650'', [http://books.google.com/books?id=w6txqpqO6xMC&pg=PA270&dq=Benjamin+Engelcke,]</ref> in the preface that one of [[Peter Cr<U+00FC>ger]]'s pupils, [[Benjamin Engelcke]], had traveled in 1632 to Italy, had met Galilei, and had brought Galilei's book to Bernegger to persuade<ref name="Dob" /> him to translate, without Galilei's permission.

Bernegger was known for his editions of classic writers like [[Tacitus]] and for his correspondence with scholars. Among his students were the [[Silesians|Silesian]] [[Daniel Czepko von Reigersfeld]] (1605<U+2013>1660), [[Johannes Freinsheim]], [[Johann Michael Moscherosch]], [[Martin Opitz]] and the [[Prussian]] [[Robert Roberthin]] (1600<U+2013>1648).

Since 1607, Bernegger taught, like his colleague [[Caspar Br<U+00FC>low]] (1585<U+2013>1627), at the Protestant Gymnasium, before he was called in 1616 to the Stra<U+00DF>burg Academy which was raised in 1621 to a University.

Bernegger was also interested in politics, and during the [[Thirty Years' War]] tried to negotiate with the French. As [[pacifist]], he opposed [[Caspar Schoppe]] who called for a holy war against Protestants.
