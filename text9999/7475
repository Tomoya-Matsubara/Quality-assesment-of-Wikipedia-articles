}}

The 2002<U+2013>03 season was [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]'s eleventh season in the [[Premier League]] and 83th consecutive season in the top division of [[Football in England|English football]]. The club retained the [[FA Cup]] <U+2013> the first team to do so since [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] in 1982, but lost out in the Premier League to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], having started March with an eight-point lead. In the [[UEFA Champions League]], defeat to [[Valencia CF|Valencia]] in the second group stage meant Arsenal exited the competition at the same round for the second successive year.

Arsenal began the new campaign as league and cup [[Double (association football)|double winners]], and manager [[Ars<U+00E8>ne Wenger]] sought improvement in the Champions League, a competition the club failed in. The retirement of defender [[Tony Adams (footballer)|Tony Adams]] meant French midfielder [[Patrick Vieira]] was appointed as captain; [[Pascal Cygan]] was signed as a replacement in defence. Other recruitments included defensive midfielders [[Gilberto Silva]] and [[Kolo Tour<U+00E9>]], with goalkeepers [[Alex Manninger]] and [[Richard Wright (footballer)|Richard Wright]] departing to join [[RCD Espanyol|Espanyol]] and [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] respectively. 

In the league, a 4<U+2013>1 win against [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]] in September meant the club broke the record for scoring in consecutive games (47), and away league games without defeat (22). The club began 2003 in first position, but a draw to [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] in April allowed Manchester United to move joint top. A further draw at [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] meant the league championship was, mathematically, out of Arsenal's hands and defeat to Leeds a week after meant the team finished in second position. Consolation came in retaining the FA Cup; a solitary goal scored by midfielder [[Robert Pir<U+00E8>s]] was enough to beat [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] in the [[2003 FA Cup Final]].
