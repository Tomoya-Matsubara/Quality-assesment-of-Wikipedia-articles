'''Willie Hugh Nelson''' (born April&nbsp;30,&nbsp;1933)<ref name="birth">Since he was born around midnight some sources use April 29, 1933</ref> is an American [[country music]] singer-songwriter, as well as an author, poet, actor, and activist. The critical success of the album ''[[Shotgun Willie]]'' (1973), combined with the critical and commercial success of ''[[Red Headed Stranger]]'' (1975) and ''[[Stardust (Willie Nelson album)|Stardust]]'' (1978),  made Nelson one of the most recognized artists in country music. He was one of the main figures of [[outlaw country]], a subgenre of country music that developed at the end of the 1960s as a reaction to the conservative restrictions of the [[Nashville sound]]. Nelson has acted in over 30 films, co-authored several books, and has been involved in activism for the use of [[biofuels]] and the [[Legality of cannabis|legalization of marijuana]].

Born during the [[Great Depression]], and raised by his grandparents, Nelson wrote his first song at age seven and joined his first band at ten. During high school, he toured locally with the ''Bohemian Polka'' as their lead singer and guitar player. After graduating from high school in 1950, he joined the Air Force but was later discharged due to back problems. After his return, Nelson attended [[Baylor University]] for two years but dropped out because he was succeeding in music. During this time, he worked as a disc jockey in Texas radio stations and a singer in [[honky tonk]]s. Nelson moved to [[Vancouver, Washington]], where he wrote "[[Family Bible (Willie Nelson album)|Family Bible]]" and recorded the song "Lumberjack" in 1956. In 1960, he signed a publishing contract with Pamper Music which allowed him to join [[Ray Price (musician)|Ray Price's]] band as a bassist. During that time, he wrote songs that would become country standards, including "[[Funny How Time Slips Away]]", "[[Hello Walls]]", "[[Pretty Paper]]", and  "[[Crazy (Willie Nelson song)|Crazy]]". In 1962, he recorded his first album, ''[[And Then I Wrote]]''. Due to this success, Nelson signed in 1964 with [[RCA Victor]] and joined the [[Grand Ole Opry]] the following year. After mid-chart hits during the end of 1960s and the beginning of the 1970s, and the failure to succeed in music, Nelson retired in 1972 and moved to [[Austin, Texas]]. The rise of the popularity of Hippie music in Austin motivated Nelson to return from retirement, performing frequently at the [[Armadillo World Headquarters]].

In 1973, after signing with [[Atlantic Records]], Nelson turned to outlaw country, including albums such as ''Shotgun Willie'' and ''Phases and Stages''. In 1975, he switched to Columbia Records, where he recorded the critically acclaimed album, ''Red Headed Stranger''. The same year, he recorded another outlaw country album, ''[[Wanted! The Outlaws]]'', which he recorded with [[Waylon Jennings]], [[Jessi Colter]], and [[Tompall Glaser]]. During the mid 1980s, while creating hit albums like ''[[Honeysuckle Rose (album)|Honeysuckle Rose]]'' and recording hit songs like "[[On the Road Again (Willie Nelson song)|On the Road Again]]", "[[To All the Girls I've Loved Before]]", and "[[Pancho & Lefty]]", he joined the country [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] [[The Highwaymen (country supergroup)|The Highwaymen]], along with fellow singers, [[Johnny Cash]], Waylon Jennings, and [[Kris Kristofferson]]. During 1990 Nelson's assets were seized by the Internal Revenue Service, that claimed that he owed US $32,000,000. It was later discovered that his accountants, [[Price Waterhouse]] did not pay Nelson's taxes for years. The impossibility of Nelson to pay his outstanding debt was aggravated by weak investments made by him during the 1980s. Nelson released in 1991 ''[[The IRS Tapes: Who'll Buy My Memories?]]'', the profits of the double album, destined to the IRS and the auction of Nelson's assets cleared his debt by 1993.
During the 1990s and 2000s, Nelson continued touring extensively, and released albums every year. Reviews ranged from positive to mixed. Nelson explored genres such as reggae, blues, jazz, and folk. Nelson made his first movie appearance in the 1979 film, ''[[The Electric Horseman]]'', followed by other appearances in movies and on television.

Nelson is a major liberal activist and the co-chair of the advisory board of the [[National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws]], which is in favor of marijuana legalization. On the environmental front, Nelson owns the bio-diesel brand [[Willie Nelson Biodiesel]], which is made from vegetable oil. Nelson is also the honorary chairman of the Advisory Board of the Texas Music Project, the official music charity of the state of Texas.

==Music career==
===Beginnings (1956<U+2013>1972)===
In 1956, Nelson moved to [[Vancouver, Washington]] to begin his formal musical career. His first record, "No Place For Me" included [[Leon Payne]]'s "Lumberjack" on the b-side,<ref>{{cite book |url= http://books.google.com/?id=4JH4e8BNIY4C&pg=PA70&dq=willie+nelson+%22Lumberjack%22#v=onepage&q=willie%20nelson%20%22Lumberjack%22&f=false |title=Country Music Facts, Figures & Fun |page=70|author=Mike Evans|publisher=AAPPL |year=2006 |accessdate=21 June 2011 |isbn= 9781904332534}}</ref> but was not successful.{{sfn|Dicair, David|2007|p=[http://books.google.com/books?id=MYMQl9dsKJEC&pg=PA246&dq=willie+nelson+%22Lumberjack%22&hl=en&ei=9tcATq3NEIep8QPmp_SxDQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CEIQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=willie%20nelson%20%22Lumberjack%22&f=false 246]}} Nelson continued working as a radio announcer and singing in Vancouver clubs.{{sfn|Erlewine, Michael|1997|p=324}} He sold the song "Family Bible" for US$50 to a guitar instructor, and the song turned into a hit for [[Claude Gray]] in 1960.{{sfn|Patoski, Joe Nick|p=Nashville, 1960}} Nelson moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] in 1960, but no label signed him. Although most of his demos were rejected, thanks to his songwriting and [[Hank Cochran]]'s help, he signed a publishing contract with Pamper Music. After Ray Price recorded Nelson's "Night Life", Nelson joined Price's touring band as a bass player. While playing with Price and the ''[[Cherokee Cowboys]]'', Nelson's songs became hits for other artists, including "[[Funny How Time Slips Away]]" ([[Billy Walker (singer)|Billy Walker]]), "[[Hello Walls]]" ([[Faron Young]]), "Pretty Paper" ([[Roy Orbison]]), and, most famously, "[[Crazy (Willie Nelson song)|Crazy]]" ([[Patsy Cline]]),{{sfn|Erlewine, Michael|1997|p=324}} which became the biggest [[jukebox]] hit of all time.<ref name=fresh/> {{Listen |filename=Hello Walls.ogg|title="Hello Walls" |description=Written by Willie Nelson, Hello Walls, was a hit for Faron Young in 1961, and the song that gave Nelson national recognition as a songwriter. He recorded the song for his debut album ''And Then I Wrote''.}}

Nelson signed with [[Liberty Records]] and was recording by August 1961 at [[Quonset Hut Studio]]. His first two successful singles as an artist were released by the next year, including "Willingly" (which became his first charting single and first Top Ten at #10) and "Touch Me" (his second Top Ten, stalling at #7), a duet with his soon-to-be second wife, [[Shirley Collie Nelson|Shirley Collie]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bsnpubs.com/liberty/liberty.html| title=The Liberty Records Story|first=David|first2=Mike|last=Edwards|last2=Callahan|work=Both Sides Now|publisher=Both Sides Now Publications|accessdate =February 7, 2011}}</ref> Unfortunately, further hit singles eluded him.

By the fall of 1964, Nelson had moved to RCA Victor Records at the behest of [[Chet Atkins]], signing a contract for US $10,000 per year.{{sfn|Reid, Jan|2004|p=[http://books.google.com/books?id=qCDF5fFuBT8C&pg=PA224&dq=Willie%27s+RCA+contract+guaranteed&hl=en&ei=vKnrTeDlK826-Aa0i43JDw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Willie%27s%20RCA%20contract%20guaranteed&f=false 224]}} ''[[Country Willie <U+2013> His Own Songs]]'' became Nelson's first RCA album, recorded in April 1965. That same year he joined the [[Grand Ole Opry]]{{sfn|Patoski, Joe Nick|p=Nashville, 1960|2008|}}. During his first few years on RCA, Nelson had no significant hits, but from November 1966 through March 1969, his singles reached the Top 25 in a consistent manner. "One In a Row" (#19, 1966), "The Party's Over" (#24 during a 16-week chart run in 1967), and his cover of [[Morecambe & Wise]]'s "Bring Me Sunshine" (#13, March 1969) were Nelson's best-selling records during his time with RCA.{{sfn|Dicair, David|2007|p=[http://books.google.com/books?id=MYMQl9dsKJEC&pg=PA246&dq=willie+nelson+%22Lumberjack%22&hl=en&ei=9tcATq3NEIep8QPmp_SxDQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CEIQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=willie%20nelson%20%22Lumberjack%22&f=false 246]}} After recording his final RCA single <U+2013> "Mountain Dew" (backed with "Phases, Stages, Circles, Cycles and Scenes") in late April 1972,  RCA requested that Nelson renew his contract ahead of schedule, with the implication that RCA would not release his latest recordings if he did not.{{sfn|Reid, Jan|2004|p=[http://books.google.com/?id=qCDF5fFuBT8C&pg=PA223&dq=Willie+Nelson+Neil+Rashen#v=onepage&q=Willie%20Nelson%20Neil%20Rashen&f=false 223]}} He signed Neil Rashen as his manager to negotiate with the label, who got RCA to agree to end Nelson's contract upon repayment of US$14,000.{{sfn|Reid, Jan|2004|p=[http://books.google.com/?id=qCDF5fFuBT8C&pg=PA223&dq=Willie+Nelson+Neil+Rashen#v=onepage&q=Willie%20Nelson%20Neil%20Rashen&f=false 223]}} During those proceedings, Nelson decided to move to [[Austin, Texas]] and take a short break. Austin's burgeoning hippie music scene (see [[Armadillo World Headquarters]]) rejuvenated the singer. His popularity in Austin soared as he played his own brand of country music marked by country, folk and jazz influences.{{sfn|Reid, Jan; Sahm Shawn|2010|p=[http://books.google.com/books?id=1gry61absiEC&pg=PA79&dq=armadillo+world+headquarters+willie+nelson&hl=en&ei=E4ITTrL0E8mBtgfQs9TFDQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CD0Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=armadillo%20world%20headquarters%20willie%20nelson&f=false 79]}} Rashen eventually signed Nelson to [[Atlantic Records]] for US$25,000 per year, becoming the label's first country artist.{{sfn|Reid, Jan|2004|p=[http://books.google.com/books?id=qCDF5fFuBT8C&pg=PA224&dq=Willie%27s+RCA+contract+guaranteed&hl=en&ei=vKnrTeDlK826-Aa0i43JDw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Willie%27s%20RCA%20contract%20guaranteed&f=false 224]}} By February 1973, Nelson was recording his acclaimed ''[[Shotgun Willie]]'' at Atlantic Studios in New York City.{{sfn|Harden, Lydia Dixon; Hoekstra, Dave; McCall, Michael; Morris, Edward; Williams, Janet|1996|p=169}}

{{Listen |filename=Shotgun Willie.ogg|title="Shotgun Willie introduction" |description=Introduction of the song "Shotgun Willie", opening track of the album of the [[Shotgun Willie|same name]] that marked a change of style from Nelson's earlier recordings.}}
''[[Shotgun Willie]]'', released in May 1973, earned excellent reviews but did not sell well. The album led Nelson to a new style, later stating that ''[[Shotgun Willie]]'' had "cleared his throat".<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=p_gYzRsNNbEC&dq=Tichi+1998&q=cleared+his+throat#v=onepage&q=cleared%20his%20throat&f=false|last=Tichi|first=Cecelia|title=Reading country music: steel guitars, opry stars, and honky-tonk bars|year=1998|page=341|publisher=Duke University Press|accessdate=July 5, 2011|isbn=9780822321682}}</ref> His next album, ''Phases and Stages'', released in 1974, was a concept album about a couple's divorce, inspired by his own experience.

Although Columbia was reluctant to release an album with primarily a guitar and piano for accompaniment, Nelson and Waylon Jennings insisted. The album included a cover of [[Fred Rose (musician)|Fred Rose]]'s 1945 song "[[Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain]]", that had been released as a single previous to the album, and became Nelson's first number one hit as a singer.{{sfn|Wolff, Kurt; Duane, Orla|p=[http://books.google.com/books?id=3Jorozp1yp4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Duane+%26+Wolff+2000,&hl=en&ei=JIYTTozJNpGltwfN7uztDQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=snippet&q=%22blue%20eyes%20crying%20in%20the%20rain%22%20hit&f=false 367]|2000}}

===IRS and later career (1990<U+2013>present)===
In 1990, the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) seized most of Nelson's assets, claiming that he owed US$32,000,000. It was later discovered that his accountants, [[Price Waterhouse]], had not been paying Nelson's taxes for years. In addition to the unpaid taxes, Nelson's situation was worsened by the weak investments he had made during the early 1980s.<ref name="history"/> His lawyer, [[Jay Goldberg]] negotiated the sum to be lowered to US$16,000,000. Later, Nelson's attorney renegotiated a settlement with the IRS in which he paid US$6,000,000, although Nelson did not comply with the agreement.{{sfn|Draper|1991|p=177}} Nelson released ''[[The IRS Tapes: Who'll Buy My Memories?]]'' as a double album, with all profits destined for the IRS. Many of his assets were auctioned and purchased by friends, who donated or rented his possessions to him for a nominal fee. He sued Price Waterhouse, contending that they put him in illegal tax shelters.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CEFD7113FF931A3575AC0A967958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all |quote=$32&nbsp;million bill for delinquent taxes ... pay for the $45&nbsp;million lawsuit Mr. Nelson filed last year against his former accountants at Price Waterhouse, who he contends put him into ill-advised tax shelters.

For many years, Nelson's image was marked by his red hair, often divided into two long braids partially concealed under a bandanna. In the April&nbsp;2007 issue of [[Stuff Magazine]] Nelson was interviewed about his long locks.<ref>{{cite web | title =Willie Nelson haircut: Country singer chops off trademark long tresses and debuts shorter new look|accessdate=February 15, 2011 |date= May 27, 2010 |url =http://www.nydailynews.com/gossip/2010/05/27/2010-05-27_willie_nelsons_new_haircut_country_singer_chops_off_trademark_long_tresses_and_d.html|work=New York Daily News|publisher=Mortimer Zuckerman}}</ref> "I started braiding my hair when it started getting too long, and that was, I don't know, probably in the 70's." On May&nbsp;26,&nbsp;2010, the Associated Press reported that Nelson had cut his hair,<ref>{{Cite document | title =The pigtails are gone: Willie Nelson cuts his hair | date =May 26, 2010 | url =http://www.lcsun-news.com/las_cruces-news/ci_15166128 |publisher=MediaNews Group|work=Las Cruces Sun-News|accessdate=February 15, 2011}}</ref> and Nashville music journalist Jimmy Carter published a photograph of the pigtail-free Nelson on his website.<ref>{{cite web | title =Willie cuts his hair | date =May 26, 2010 | url =http://askjimmycarter.blogspot.com/2010/05/willie-cuts-his-hair.html | postscript =<!--None-->}}</ref> Reportedly, he wanted a more maintainable hairstyle, as well helping him stay cool more easily at his [[Maui]] home.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://new.music.yahoo.com/blogs/ourcountry/32905/willie-nelson-cuts-off-his-braids/|title=Willie Nelson Cuts Off His Braids!|publisher=Yahoo!
