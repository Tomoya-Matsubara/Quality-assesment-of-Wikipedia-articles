'''Rowland Charles Wentworth Greenberg''' (born 28 August 1920 in [[Oslo]], died 2 April 1994) was a Norwegian jazz musician (trumpet), seen by many as one of the foremost names in Norwegian [[jazz]]<ref>{{store norske leksikon|Rowland_Greenberg}}</ref> in the 1940s and 50s.<ref>[http://www.jazzprofessional.com/interviews/RowlandGreenberg.htm jazzprofessional.com] interview and [http://www.mic.no/symfoni/kontakt.nsf/pub/per2006052413222942279697 biography] from [[Norsk Musikkinformasjon]]</ref>

With a style inspired by the Englishman Nat Gonella, he guested in 1938   
in leading orchestras such as [[Hot Dogs]] and [[Funny Boys]].<ref>{{cite news|author=[[Stein Kagge]]|title=Rowland Greenberg|date=1994-04-18|publisher=[[Aftenposten]]}}</ref>
Before his music career, he was also one of the country's leading cyclists. As a member of [[SK Rye]], he was Oslo champion in 1937 in the 1000 metres track cycling and 20&nbsp;km road cycling. The following year, he won the team championships at the junior National Championships in 20&nbsp;km road cycling.<ref>{{cycling archives|42336}}</ref>

After trips to [[England]] (1938<U+2013>39) with Vic Lewis and [[George Shearing]],
he was a central part of [[Oslo]]'s swing-jazz milieu, where he led his own '''Rowland Greenberg Swing Band''' (1939<U+2013>41) with [[Arvid Gram Paulsen]] on sax, [[Lulle Kristoffersen]] on piano and  [[Pete Brown]] on drums.  He also led his '''Rowland Greenberg Rytmeorkester''' (1940<U+2013>44), with [[Gordon Franklin]] on tenor sax, [[Arvid Gram Paulsen]] on alto sax, [[Robert Normann]] on guitar, [[Kjell Bj<U+00F8>rnstad]], Frank Hansen, [[Lyder Vengbo]] on trombone, [[Fred Lange-Nielsen]] on bass.  A record release (1942) was banned by the German regime, and he was jailed for breaching the [[Rytmeklubbforbundet]] by viewing jazz films (1943).

After his release from [[Grini concentration camp|Grini]], he was also active in [[Sweden]] (with [[Cecil Aagaard]], [[Thore Erling]] and [[Malte Johnson]]) and [[England]] (with [[Jimmie Woode]] and [[Sam Samson]]). He also toured Norway with his own band (1948<U+2013>50), including presenting [[bebop]] to the country.  
Greenberg took part in the <U+00AB>All-Star Trumpets session<U+00BB> (Paris Jazz Festival, 1949) with [[Miles Davis]], [[Bill Coleman]], [[Jimmy McPartland]] and [[Aime Barelli]].  Greenberg also played with [[Charlie Parker]] who joined Greenberg in his [[Sweden]] tour band (1950), along with [[Louis Armstrong]] (1952), and [[Down Beat]], who gave Greenberg the first chart placing of his career. 
During the 50s, he played extensively in the orchestras led by [[Egil Monn-Iversen]], [[Leiv Flisnes]] and [[Terje Kj<U+00E6>r]]. He led his own orchestras including [[Mikkel Flagstad]] on piano,
[[Totti Bergh]] on saxsophone, [[Knut Young]] on bass, [[Ivar Wefring]] on piano, [[Bj<U+00F8>rn Krokfoss]] on drums (until 1981), and played with [[Ben Webster]] ([[Moldejazz]], 1969) and [[Teddy Wilson]].
