Morton]] on October 16, 1846 in the [[Ether Dome]] at [[Massachusetts General Hospital]], [[Boston]].

Attempts at producing a state of '''[[general anesthesia]]''' can be traced throughout [[recorded history]] in the writings of the ancient [[Sumer]]ians, [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]], [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]], [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Indus Valley Civilization|Indians]], and [[History of China#Ancient era|Chinese]]. During the [[Middle Ages]], the scientific culture withered in Europe, but fortunately this period coincided with the [[Islamic Golden Age]], a time when [[science in medieval Islam|medieval Islamic science]] flourished. Islamic physicians and other Eastern scholars maintained and advanced the practice of [[Medicine in medieval Islam|medicine]] in the [[Arab World]] during that period.

The European [[Renaissance]] saw significant advances in [[anatomy]] and [[surgery|surgical technique]]. However, despite all this progress, surgery remained a treatment of last resort. Largely because of the associated [[pain]], many patients with surgical disorders chose certain death rather than undergo surgery. Although there has been a great deal of debate as to who deserves the most credit for the discovery of general anesthesia, it is generally agreed that certain scientific discoveries in the late 18th and early 19th centuries were critical to the eventual introduction and development of modern anesthetic techniques.

Two "quantum leaps" occurred in the late 19th century, which together allowed the transition to [[Modernity|modern]] surgery. An appreciation of the [[germ theory of disease]] led rapidly to the development and application of [[antiseptic]] techniques in surgery. Antisepsis, which soon gave way to [[asepsis]], reduced the overall [[morbidity]] and [[Mortality rate|mortality]] of surgery to a far more acceptable rate than in previous eras. Concurrent with these developments were the significant advances in [[pharmacology]] and [[physiology]] which led to the development of general anesthesia and the control of pain.

In the 20th century, the safety and efficacy of general anesthesia was improved by the routine use of [[tracheal intubation]] and other advanced [[airway management]] techniques. Significant advances in [[Medical monitor|monitoring]] and new [[anesthetic|anesthetic agents]] with improved [[Pharmacokinetics|pharmacokinetic]] and [[Pharmacodynamics|pharmacodynamic]] characteristics also contributed to this trend. Finally, standardized training programs for [[anesthesiologist]]s and [[nurse anesthetist]]s emerged during this period.

==Etymology of "anesthesia"==
The word "anesthesia", [[Neologism|coined]] by [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.]] (1809<U+2013>1894) in 1846 from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|<U+03B1><U+03BD>-}}, ''an-'', "without"; and {{lang|grc|<U+03B1><U+1F34><U+03C3><U+03B8><U+03B7><U+03C3><U+03B9><U+03C2>}}, ''aisth<U+0113>sis'', "sensation"),<ref name=Small1962/> refers to the inhibition of [[Wikt:sensation|sensation]].

The first attempts at general anesthesia were probably [[herbalism|herbal remedies]] administered in [[prehistory]]. [[Opium poppy|Opium poppies]] were cultivated and harvested in ancient [[Mesopotamia]] as early as 4200 BC in Sumeria and succeeding empires. The use of [[opium]]-like preparations in anesthesia is recorded in the [[Ebers Papyrus]] of 1500 BC. By 1100 BC poppies were scored for opium collection in [[Cyprus]] by methods similar to those used today. Simple apparatus for smoking of opium have been discovered in a [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] temple.

Prior to the introduction of opium to [[Indus Valley Civilization|ancient India]] (ca. 330 BC) and [[History of China#Ancient era|China]] (ca. AD 600<U+2013>1200), these civilizations pioneered the use of [[cannabis]] [[incense]] and [[aconitum]]. Circa 400 BC, the [[Sushruta Samhita]] (a text from the [[Indian subcontinent]] on [[Ayurveda|ayurvedic medicine]] and surgery) advocates the use of [[wine]] with incense of cannabis for anesthesia.<ref name=Sushruta/>

[[Hua Tuo]] (<U+83EF>, circa AD 145-208) was a Chinese [[surgeon]] of the second century AD. According to the ''[[Records of Three Kingdoms]]'' (ca. AD 270) and the ''[[Book of the Later Han]]'' (ca. AD 430), Hua Tuo performed surgery under general anesthesia using a formula he had developed by mixing wine with a mixture of [[herbal extract]]s he called ''[[Hua Tuo#Mafeisan|mafeisan]]'' (<U+9EBB><U+6CB8><U+6563>).<ref name=Chu2004/> Hua Tuo reportedly used mafeisan to perform even major operations such as [[resection]] of [[Gangrene|gangrenous]] [[intestines]].<ref name=Chu2004/> Before the surgery, he administered an oral anesthetic [[potion]], probably dissolved in wine, in order to induce a state of [[unconsciousness]] and partial [[Neuromuscular-blocking drug|neuromuscular blockade]].<ref name=Chu2004/>

The exact composition of mafeisan, similar to all of Hua Tuo's clinical knowledge, was lost when he burned his manuscripts, just before his death.<ref name=Chen2008/> The composition of the anesthetic powder was not mentioned in either the ''Records of Three Kingdoms'' or the ''Book of the Later Han''. Because [[Confucianism|Confucian]] teachings regarded the body as [[sacred]] and surgery was considered a form of body mutilation, surgery was strongly discouraged in [[History of China#Ancient era|ancient China]]. Because of this, despite Hua Tuo's reported success with general anesthesia, the practice of surgery in ancient China ended with his death.<ref name=Chu2004/>

The name ''mafeisan'' combines ''ma'' ([[Wikt:<U+9EBB>|<U+9EBB>]], meaning "cannabis, [[hemp]], [[Anesthesia|numbed]] or [[Paresthesia|tingling]]"), ''fei'' ([[Wikt:<U+6CB8>|<U+6CB8>]], meaning "[[boiling]] or bubbling"), and ''san'' ([[Wikt:<U+6563>|<U+6563>]], meaning "to break up or scatter", or "medicine in powder form"). Therefore, the word ''mafeisan'' probably means something like "cannabis boil powder". Many [[Sinology|sinologist]]s and scholars of [[traditional Chinese medicine]] have guessed at the composition of Hua Tuo's mafeisan powder, but the exact components still remain unclear. His formula is believed to have contained some combination of:<ref name=Chu2004/><ref name=Chen2008/><ref name=Wang1999/><ref name=Fu2002/>
*''bai zhi'' (''[[Angelica dahurica]]''),
*''cao wu'' (<U+8349><U+70CF>, ''[[Wikispecies:Aconitum kusnezoffii|Aconitum kusnezoffii]]'', ''[[Aconitum|Aconitum kusnezoffii]]'', ''Kusnezoff's monkshood'', or ''wolfsbane'' root),
*''chu<U+0101>n xi<U+014D>ng'' (''[[Ligusticum wallichii]]''),
*''dong quai'' (''[[Angelica sinensis]]''),
*''wu tou'' (<U+70CF><U+982D> "rhizome of ''Aconitum'', Chinese monkshood"),
*''yang jin hua'' (<U+6D0B><U+91D1><U+82B1>, ''[[Wikispecies:Datura metel|Flos Daturae metelis]]'', or ''[[Datura stramonium]]''),
*[[rhododendron]] flower, and
*[[jasmine]] root.
Others have suggested the potion may have also contained ''[[Mandragora officinarum]]'', [[hashish]] or [[bhang]],<ref name=Giles1897/><ref name=Giles1948/> or <ref name=Smith1871/> opium.<ref name=Veith1972/> [[Victor H. Mair]] wrote that ''mafei'' "appears to be a transcription of some [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] word related to "morphine"."<ref name=Mair2000/> Some authors believe that Hua Tuo may have discovered surgical analgesia by [[acupuncture]], and that mafeisan either had nothing to do with or was simply an adjunct to his strategy for anesthesia.<ref name=Lu2002/> Many physicians have attempted to re-create the same formulation based on historical records but none have achieved the same clinical efficacy as Hua Tuo's. In any event, Hua Tuo's formula did not appear to be effective for major operations.<ref name=Mair2000/><ref name=Wai2004/>

Arabic and Persian physicians were among the first to utilize oral as well as [[Inhalational anaesthetic|inhaled anesthetics]]. [[Ferdowsi]] (940<U+2013>1020) was a [[Persian people|Persian]] [[poet]] who lived in the [[Abbasid Caliphate]]. In ''[[Shahnameh]]'', his [[national epic]] poem, Ferdowsi described a [[caesarean section]] performed on [[Rudaba]]. A special wine prepared by a [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] priest was used as an anesthetic for this operation.<ref name=Gordon1949/> Although ''Shahnameh'' is mythical in content, the passage nevertheless supports the idea that general anesthesia had at least been attempted in [[Iran#Middle Ages .28652.E2.80.931501.29|ancient Persia]], even if not successfully.

In 1000, [[Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi]] (936-1013), an Arab physician who lived in [[Al-Andalus]], published the 30-volume [[Al-Tasrif|''Kitab al-Tasrif'']], the first illustrated work on surgery. In this book, he wrote about the use of general anesthesia for surgery. Circa 1020, [[Avicenna|Ibn S<U+012B>n<U+0101>]] (980<U+2013>1037) described the use of inhaled anesthesia in ''[[The Canon of Medicine]]''. The ''Canon'' described the "soporific sponge", a [[Sponge (material)|sponge]] imbued with [[Aromaticity|aromatics]] and [[narcotic]]s, which was to be placed under a patient's nose during surgical operations.<ref name=Skinner2008/> [[Ibn Zuhr]] (1091<U+2013>1161) was another Arab physician from Al-Andalus. In his 12th century medical textbook ''Al-Taisir'', Ibn Zuhr describes the use of general anesthesia. These three physicians were among many who performed operations under inhaled anesthesia with the use of narcotic-soaked sponges.<ref name=Ajram1992/><ref name=Hunke1969/>

[[Joseph Priestley]] (1733<U+2013>1804) was an English [[polymath]] who discovered [[nitrous oxide]], [[nitric oxide]], [[ammonia]], [[hydrogen chloride]] and (along with [[Carl Wilhelm Scheele]] and [[Antoine Lavoisier]]) [[oxygen]]. Beginning in 1775, Priestley published his research in ''[[Experiments and Observations on Different Kinds of Air]]'', a six-volume work.<ref name=Priestley1775/> The recent discoveries about these and other [[gas]]es stimulated a great deal of interest in the European scientific community. [[Thomas Beddoes]] (1760<U+2013>1808) was an English [[philosophy|philosopher]], physician and teacher of medicine, and like his colleague Priestley, was also a member of the [[Lunar Society of Birmingham]]. With an eye toward making further advances in this new science as well as offering treatment for diseases previously thought to be untreatable (such as [[asthma]] and [[tuberculosis]]), Beddoes founded the ''Pneumatic Institution'' for inhalation gas therapy in 1798 at [[Dowry Square]] in [[Clifton, Bristol]].<ref name=Levere1977/> Beddoes employed [[chemist]] and physicist [[Humphry Davy]] (1778<U+2013>1829) as superintendent of the institute, and [[engineer]] [[James Watt]] (1736<U+2013>1819) to help manufacture the gases. Other members of the Lunar Society such as [[Erasmus Darwin]] and [[Josiah Wedgwood]] were also actively involved with the institute.

During the course of his research at the Pneumatic Institution, Davy discovered the anesthetic properties of nitrous oxide.<ref name=Sneader2005/> Davy, who coined the term "laughing gas" for nitrous oxide, published his findings the following year in the now-classic [[treatise]], ''Researches, chemical and philosophical<U+2013>chiefly concerning nitrous oxide or dephlogisticated nitrous air, and its respiration''. Davy was not a physician, and he never administered nitrous oxide during a surgical procedure. He was however the first to document the [[analgesic]] effects of nitrous oxide, as well as its potential benefits in relieving pain during surgery:<ref name=Davy1800/>{{quote|"As ni<U+00AD>trous oxide in its extensive operation appears capable of destroying physical pain, it may probably be used with advantage during surgical operations in which no great effusion of blood takes place."}}

[[Image:HanaokaSeishu.gif|thumb|[[Hanaoka Seish<U+016B>]], Japanese surgeon of the 18th and 19th centuries]]
[[Hanaoka Seish<U+016B>]] (<U+83EF><U+5CA1> <U+9752><U+6D32>, 1760<U+2013>1835) of [[Osaka]] was a Japanese surgeon of the [[Edo period]] with a knowledge of [[Chinese herbology|Chinese herbal medicine]], as well as Western surgical techniques techniques he had learned through ''[[Rangaku]]'' (literally "Dutch learning", and by extension "Western learning"). Beginning in about 1785, Hanaoka embarked on a quest to re-create a compound that would have pharmacologic properties similar to Hua Tuo's mafeisan.<ref name=Izuo2004/> After years of research and experimentation, he finally developed a formula which he named ''ts<U+016B>sensan'' (also known as ''mafutsu-san''). Like that of Hua Tuo, this compound was composed of extracts of several different plants, including:<ref name=Ogata1973/><ref name=Hyodo1992/><ref name=BLTC/>
*2 parts ''bai zhi'' (''Angelica dahurica'');
*2 parts ''cao wu'' (''Aconitum sp.'', ''monkshood'' or ''wolfsbane'');
*2 parts ''chu<U+0101>n ban xia'' (''[[Pinellia ternata]]'');
*2 parts ''chu<U+0101>n xi<U+014D>ng'' (''Ligusticum wallichii'', ''Cnidium rhizome'', ''Cnidium officinale'' or ''Szechuan lovage'');
*2 parts ''dong quai'' (''Angelica sinensis'' or ''female [[ginseng]]'');
*1 part ''tian nan xing'' (''[[Arisaema|Arisaema rhizomatum]]'' or ''cobra lily'')
*8 parts ''yang jin hua'' (''Datura stramonium'', ''Korean morning glory'', ''thorn apple'', ''jimson weed'', ''devil's trumpet'', ''stinkweed'', or ''locoweed'').
The reader will note that five of these seven ingredients were thought to be elements of Hua Tuo's anesthetic potion, 1600 years earlier. Some sources claim that ''[[Garden Angelica|Angelica archangelica]]'' (often referred to as ''garden angelica'', ''holy ghost'', or ''wild celery'') was also an ingredient.

The active ingredients in ts<U+016B>sensan are [[scopolamine]], [[hyoscyamine]], [[atropine]], [[aconitine]] and [[angelicotoxin]]. When consumed in sufficient quantity, ts<U+016B>sensan produces a state of general anesthesia and [[skeletal muscle]] [[paralysis]].<ref name=BLTC/> [[Shutei Nakagawa]] (1773<U+2013>1850), a close friend of Hanaoka, wrote a small pamphlet entitled "Mayaku-ko" ("narcotic powder") in 1796. Although the original manuscript was lost in a fire in 1867, this brochure described the current state of Hanaoka's research on general anesthesia.<ref name=Matsuki1999/>

On 13 October 1804, Hanaoka performed a partial [[mastectomy]] for [[breast cancer]] on a 60 year old woman named Kan Aiya, using ts<U+016B>sensan as a [[general anesthetic]]. This is generally regarded today as the first reliable documentation of an operation to be performed under general anesthesia.<ref name=Izuo2004/><ref name=Hyodo1992/><ref name=Perrin1979/><ref name=Matsuki2000/> Hanaoka went on to perform many operations using ts<U+016B>sensan, including resection of [[malignancy|malignant]] [[tumor]]s, extraction of [[Urolithiasis|bladder stones]], and extremity [[amputation]]s. Before his death in 1835, Hanaoka performed more than 150 operations for breast cancer.<ref name=Izuo2004/><ref name=Matsuki2000/><ref name=Tominaga1994/><ref name=Matsuki2002/>

Although [[Friedrich Sert<U+00FC>rner]] (1783<U+2013>1841) first isolated [[morphine]] from [[opium]] in 1804, Victor Mair suggests that "It is conceivable that some such name as morphine was already in use before as a designation for the anesthetic properties of this opium derivative or some other naturally occurring substance."

[[Henry Hill Hickman]] (1800<U+2013>1830) experimented with the use of [[carbon dioxide]] as an anesthetic in the 1820s. He would make the animal insensible, effectively via almost suffocating it with carbon dioxide, then determine the effects of the gas by amputating one of its limbs. In 1824, Hickman submitted his the results of his research to the [[Royal Society]]. The response was an 1826 article in [[The Lancet|The Lancet]] titled 'Surgical Humbug' that ruthlessly criticised his work. Hickman died four years later at age 30. Though he was unappreciated at the time of his death, his work has since been positively reappraised and he is now recognised as one of the fathers of anesthesia.

By the late 1830s, Humphry Davy's experiments had become widely publicized within academic circles in the northeastern United States. Wandering lecturers would hold public gatherings, referred to as "ether frolics", where members of the audience were encouraged to inhale [[diethyl ether|ether]] or nitrous oxide to demonstrate the mind-altering properties of these agents while providing much entertainment to on<U+00AD>lookers.<ref name=Desai2007/> Four notable men participated in these events and witnessed the use of ether in this manner. They were [[William Edward Clarke]] (1819<U+2013>1898), [[Crawford Long]] (1815<U+2013>1878), [[Horace Wells]] (1815<U+2013>1848), and [[William T. G. Morton]] (1819<U+2013>1868).

While attending undergraduate school in Rochester, New York in 1839, classmates Clarke and Morton apparently participated in ether frolics with some regularity.<ref name=Sims1877/><ref name=Lyman1881/><ref name=Lyman1886/><ref name=Richmond1950/> In January 1842, by now a medical student at [[University of Vermont College of Medicine|Berkshire Medical College]], Clarke administered ether to a Miss Hobbie, while Elijah Pope performed a [[dental extraction]].<ref name=Lyman1881/> In doing so, he became the first to administer to administer an inhaled anesthetic to facilitate the performance of a surgical procedure. Clarke apparently thought little of his accomplishment, and chose not to pursue this technique any further. Indeed, this event is not even mentioned in Clarke's biography.<ref name=Stone1898/>

Crawford Long was a physician and pharmacist practicing in [[Jefferson, Georgia]] in the mid-19th century. During his time as a student at the [[University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine]] in the late 1830s, he had observed and probably participated in the ether frolics that had become popular at that time. At these gatherings, Long observed that some participants experienced bumps and bruises, but afterward had no recall of what had happened. He postulated that that diethyl ether produced pharmacologic effects similar to those of nitrous oxide. On 30 March 1842, he administered diethyl ether by inhalation to a man named James Venable, in order to remove a tumor from the man's neck.<ref name=Long1849/> Long later removed a second tumor from Venable, under ether anesthesia. He went on to employ ether as a general anesthetic for limb amputations and [[childbirth|parturition]]. Long however did not publish his experience until 1849, thereby denying himself much of the credit he deserved.<ref name=Long1849/>

Horace Wells, a Connecticut dentist, had successfully used nitrous oxide for several dental extractions, but his attempt to demonstrate the use of nitrous oxide on 20 January 1845 at [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] with surgeon [[John Collins Warren]] was a failure.<ref name=Wells1847/>

William T. G. Morton was another [[New England]] dentist, a former classmate of William Edward Clarke, and a business partner of Horace Wells. On 30 September 1846, Morton administered diethyl ether to Eben Frost, a music teacher from [[Boston]], for a dental extraction. Two weeks later, Morton became the first to publicly demonstrate the use of diethyl ether as a general anesthetic at Massachusetts General Hospital, in what is known today as the [[Ether Dome]].<ref name=Morton1847/> On 16 October 1846, John Collins Warren removed a tumor from the neck of a local printer, [[Edward Gilbert Abbott]]. Upon completion of the procedure, Warren reportedly quipped, "Gentlemen, this is no humbug." News of this event rapidly traveled around the world.<ref name=Fenster2001/> Morton published his experience that year. {{cn}} [[Harvard University]] professor [[Charles Thomas Jackson]] (1805<U+2013>1880) later claimed that Morton stole his idea;<ref name=Jackson1861/> Morton disagreed and a lifelong dispute began.<ref name=Fenster2001/> For many years, Morton was credited as being the pioneer of general anesthesia in the Western hemisphere, despite the fact that his demonstration occurred four years after Long's initial experience. Long later petitioned [[William Crosby Dawson]] (1798<U+2013>1856), a United States Senator from Georgia at that time, to support his claim on the floor of the [[United States Senate]] as the first to use ether anesthesia.<ref name=Northen1910/>

In 1847, Scottish [[obstetrics|obstetrician]] [[James Young Simpson]] (1811<U+2013>1870) of [[Edinburgh]] was the first to use [[chloroform]] as a general anesthetic. The use of chloroform anesthesia expanded rapidly thereafter in Europe. Chloroform began to replace ether as an anesthetic in the United States at the beginning of the 20th century. It was soon abandoned in favor of ether when its [[liver|hepatic]] and [[heart|cardiac]] [[toxicity]], especially its tendency to cause potentially fatal [[cardiac dysrhythmia]]s, became apparent.

In 1871, the German surgeon [[Friedrich Trendelenburg]] (1844<U+2013>1924) published a paper describing the first successful [[Choice|elective]] human [[tracheotomy]] to be performed for the purpose of administration of general anesthesia.<ref name=Trendelenburg1871/><ref name=Hargrave1934/><ref name=Wawersik1991/><ref name=Bain1964/>

In 1880, the Scottish surgeon [[William Macewen]] (1848<U+2013>1924) reported on his use of orotracheal intubation as an alternative to tracheotomy to allow a patient with glottic edema to breathe, as well as in the setting of general anesthesia with [[chloroform]].<ref name=Macewen18800724/><ref name=Macewen18800731/><ref name=Macmillan2010/> All previous observations of the glottis and larynx (including those of [[Manuel Patricio Rodr<U+00ED>guez Garc<U+00ED>a|Manuel Garc<U+00ED>a]],<ref name=Garcia1855/> [[Wilhelm Hack]]<ref name="Hack1878-sammlung"/><ref name="Hack1878-uber"/> and Macewen) had been performed under indirect vision (using mirrors) until 23 April 1895, when [[Alfred Kirstein]] (1863<U+2013>1922) of Germany first described direct visualization of the vocal cords. Kirstein performed the first direct laryngoscopy in Berlin, using an esophagoscope he had modified for this purpose; he called this device an ''autoscope''.<ref name=Hirsch1986/> The death of [[Frederick III, German Emperor|Emperor Frederick III]] (1831<U+2013>1888)<ref name=Mackenzie1888/> may have motivated Kirstein to develop the autoscope.<ref name=Burkle2004/>

==20th century==
[[File:Hermann Emil Fischer.jpg|thumb|[[Hermann Emil Fischer]], German [[chemist]]]]
In 1902, [[Hermann Emil Fischer]] (1852<U+2013>1919) and [[Joseph von Mering]] (1849<U+2013>1908) discovered that [[barbital|diethylbarbituric acid]] was an effective [[hypnotic]] agent.<ref name=Fischer1903/> Also called barbital or ''Veronal'' (the [[trade name]] assigned to it by [[Bayer|Bayer Pharmaceuticals]]), this new drug became the first commercially marketed [[barbiturate]]; it was used as a treatment for [[insomnia]] from 1903 until the mid-1950s.

Until 1913, [[oral and maxillofacial surgery]] was performed by mask [[Inhalational anaesthetic|inhalation anesthesia]], topical application of [[local anesthetic]]s to the [[Mucous membrane|mucosa]], rectal anesthesia, or [[Intravenous therapy|intravenous]] anesthesia. While otherwise effective, these techniques did not protect the airway from obstruction and also exposed patients to the risk of pulmonary aspiration of blood and [[mucus]] into the tracheobronchial tree. In 1913, [[Chevalier Jackson]] (1865<U+2013>1958) was the first to report a high rate of success for the use of direct laryngoscopy as a means to intubate the trachea.<ref name=Jackson1913/> Jackson introduced a new laryngoscope blade that had a light source at the distal tip, rather than the proximal light source used by Kirstein.<ref name=Zeitels1998/> This new blade incorporated a component that the operator could slide out to allow room for passage of an endotracheal tube or bronchoscope.<ref name=Jackson1922/>

Also in 1913, [[Henry H. Janeway]] (1873<U+2013>1921) published results he had achieved using a laryngoscope he had recently developed.<ref name=Janeway1913/> An American anesthesiologist practicing at [[Bellevue Hospital Center|Bellevue Hospital]] in [[New York City]], Janeway was of the opinion that direct intratracheal [[Insufflation (medicine)|insufflation]] of [[Volatile anaesthetic|volatile anesthetics]] would provide improved conditions for [[Otolaryngology|otolaryngologic]] surgery. With this in mind, he developed a laryngoscope designed for the sole purpose of tracheal intubation. Similar to Jackson's device, Janeway's instrument incorporated a distal light source. Unique however was the inclusion of [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]] within the handle, a central notch in the blade for maintaining the tracheal tube in the midline of the oropharynx during intubation and a slight curve to the distal tip of the blade to help guide the tube through the glottis. The success of this design led to its subsequent use in other types of surgery. Janeway was thus instrumental in popularizing the widespread use of direct laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation in the practice of anesthesiology.<ref name=Burkle2004/>

[[Sodium thiopental]], the first [[intravenous anesthetic]], was synthesized in 1934 by [[Ernest H. Volwiler]] (1893<U+2013>1992) and [[Donalee L. Tabern]] (1900<U+2013>1974), working for [[Abbott Laboratories]].<ref name=Tabern1935/> It was first used in humans on 8 March 1934 by [[Ralph M. Waters]] in an investigation of its properties, which were short-term anesthesia and surprisingly little analgesia. Three months later, [[John Silas Lundy]] started a clinical trial of thiopental at the [[Mayo Clinic]] at the request of Abbott Laboratories. Volwiler and Tabern were awarded U.S. Patent No. 2,153,729 in 1939 for the discovery of thiopental, and they were inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 1986.

After [[World War I]], further advances were made in the field of intratracheal anesthesia. Among these were those made by Sir [[Ivan Magill|Ivan Whiteside Magill]] (1888<U+2013>1986). Working at the [[Frognal House|Queen's Hospital for Facial and Jaw Injuries]] in [[Sidcup]] with plastic surgeon Sir [[Harold Gillies]] (1882<U+2013>1960) and anesthetist [[E. Stanley Rowbotham]] (1890<U+2013>1979), Magill developed the technique of awake blind nasotracheal intubation.<ref name=Rowbotham1921/><ref name="Magill1923-provision"/><ref name=Magill1928/><ref name=Magill1930/><ref name=Thomas1978/><ref name=Mclachlan2008/> Magill devised a new type of angulated forceps (the Magill forceps) that are still used today to facilitate nasotracheal intubation in a manner that is little changed from Magill's original technique.<ref name=Magill1920/> Other devices invented by Magill include the Magill laryngoscope blade,<ref name=Magill1926/> as well as several apparati for the administration of volatile anesthetic agents.<ref name="Magill1921-portable"/><ref name="Magill1921-warming"/><ref name="Magill1923-apparatus"/> The Magill curve of an endotracheal tube is also named for Magill.

An anesthesia department was established at the Massachusetts General Hospital in 1936 under the leadership of [[Henry Knowles Beecher]].{{cn}}

Sir [[Robert Reynolds Macintosh]] (1897<U+2013>1989) also achieved significant advances in techniques for tracheal intubation when he introduced his new curved laryngoscope blade in 1943.<ref name=Macintosh1943/> The Macintosh blade remains to this day the most widely used laryngoscope blade for orotracheal intubation.<ref name=Scott2009/> In 1949, Macintosh published a case report describing the novel use of a [[Natural rubber|gum elastic]] [[Urinary catheterization#Catheter types|urinary catheter]] as an endotracheal tube introducer to facilitate difficult tracheal intubation.<ref name=Macintosh1949/> Inspired by Macintosh's report, P. Hex Venn (who was at that time the anesthetic advisor to the British firm Eschmann Bros. & Walsh, Ltd.) set about developing an endotracheal tube introducer based on this concept. Venn's design was accepted in March 1973, and what became known as the Eschmann endotracheal tube introducer went into production later that year.<ref name=Venn1993/> The material of Venn's design was different from that of a gum elastic bougie in that it had two layers: a core of tube woven from [[polyester]] threads and an outer [[resin]] layer. This provided more stiffness but maintained the flexibility and the slippery surface. Other differences were the length (the new introducer was {{convert|60|cm|0|1|abbr=on|sp=us}}, which is much longer than the gum elastic bougie) and the presence of a 35<U+00B0> curved tip, permitting it to be steered around obstacles.<ref name=Viswanathan1992/><ref name=Henderson2003/>

The concept of using a fiberoptic endoscope for tracheal intubation was introduced by [[Peter Murphy (anaesthetist)|Peter Murphy]], an English anesthetist, in 1967.<ref name=Murphy1967>{{cite journal|last=Murphy|first=P|title=A fibre-optic endoscope used for nasal intubation|journal=[[Anaesthesia (journal)|Anaesthesia]]|volume=22|issue=3|pages=489<U+2013>91|year=1967|pmid=4951601|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2044.1967.tb02771.x|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4951601|accessdate=09-13-2010}}</ref> By the mid-1980s, the flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope had become an indispensable instrument within the [[pulmonology]] and anesthesia communities.<ref name=Wheeler2007/>

==21st century==
The 20th century saw the transformation of the practices of tracheotomy, endoscopy and non-surgical tracheal intubation from rarely employed procedures to essential components of the practices of anesthesia, [[Intensive-care medicine|critical care medicine]], [[emergency medicine]], [[gastroenterology]], pulmonology and surgery. The [[Information Age|"digital revolution"]] of the 21st century has brought newer technology to the art and science of tracheal intubation. Several manufacturers have developed [[Video_laryngoscope#Video_laryngoscope|video laryngoscopes]] which employ [[Digital electronics|digital technology]] such as the [[CMOS]] [[active pixel sensor]] (CMOS APS) to generate a view of the glottis so that the trachea may be intubated. The Glidescope video laryngoscope is one example of such a device.<ref name=Agro2003/><ref name=Cooper2005/>

[[Xenon]] has been used as a general anesthetic. Although it is expensive, anesthesia machines that can deliver xenon are about to appear on the European market, because advances in recovery and recycling of xenon have made it economically viable.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Tonner|first=P. H.|title=Xenon: one small step for anaesthesia<U+2026>?

The first one involves the inhibition of the [[Plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPase|calcium ATPase pump]]<U+2014>the mechanism cells use to remove calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>)<U+2014>in the [[cell membrane]] of [[Chemical synapse|synapses]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Franks|first=John J.|coauthors=Horn, Jean-Louis; Janicki, Piotr K.; Singh, Gurkeerat|title=Halothane, Isoflurane, Xenon, and Nitrous Oxide Inhibit Calcium ATPase Pump Activity in Rat Brain Synaptic Plasma Membranes.|journal=Anesthesiology|year=1995|volume=82|issue=1|pages=108<U+2013>117|doi = 10.1097/00000542-199501000-00015|pmid=7832292}}</ref> This results from a [[conformational isomerism|conformational change]] when xenon binds to nonpolar sites inside the protein.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lopez|first=Maria M.|coauthors=Kosk-Kosicka, Danuta|title=How do volatile anesthetics inhibit Ca<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup>-ATPases? |journal=Journal of Biological Chemistry |year=1995|volume=270|issue=47|pages=28239<U+2013>28245|doi=10.1074/jbc.270.47.28239|pmid=7499320}}</ref> The second mechanism focuses on the non-specific interactions between the anesthetic and the [[Lipid bilayer|lipid membrane]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Heimburg|first=T.|coauthors=Jackson A.

Xenon has a [[minimum alveolar concentration]] (MAC) of 71%, making it 50% more potent than N<sub>2</sub>O as an anesthetic. Thus it can be used in concentrations with oxygen that have a lower risk of [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]]. Unlike [[nitrous oxide]] (N<sub>2</sub>O), xenon is not a [[greenhouse gas]] and so it is also viewed as [[environmentally friendly]].<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://journals.lww.com/anesthesiology/Fulltext/2003/01000/Will_Xenon_Be_a_Stranger_or_a_Friend___The_Cost,.2.aspx|journal=Anesthesiology|year=2003|volume=98|issue=1|page=1|title=Future of Xenon Anesthesia|author=Goto, Takahisa; Nakata, Yoshinori; Morita, Shigeho}}</ref> Xenon vented into the atmosphere is being returned to its original source, so no environmental impact is likely.
