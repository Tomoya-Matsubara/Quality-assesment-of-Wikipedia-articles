The '''Shanghai Cooperation Organisation''' ('''SCO''') is an [[intergovernmental]] mutual-security organisation which was founded in 2001 by the leaders of [[People's Republic of China|China]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Russia]], [[Tajikistan]], and [[Uzbekistan]]. Except for Uzbekistan, the other countries had been members of the '''Shanghai Five''', founded in 1996; after the inclusion of Uzbekistan in 2001, the members renamed the organisation.

==Official names==
The official [[working language]]s of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation are [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and [[Russian language|Russian]]. The official names of the organisation in the two languages, abbreviations in parentheses, are:

==Origins==
[[Image:Shanghai Five Leaders.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Former Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]], Kazakh President [[Nursultan Nazarbayev]], Former Chinese President [[Jiang Zemin]], Former Kyrgyz President [[Askar Akayev]], and Tajik President [[Emomali Rakhmonov]], the original leaders of the Shanghai Five.]]
The Shanghai Five grouping was originally created 26 April, 1996 with the signing of the ''Treaty on Deepening Military Trust in Border Regions'' in [[Shanghai]] by the heads of states of Kazakhstan, the People's Republic of China, Kyrgyzstan, Russia and Tajikistan. 24 April, 1997 the same countries signed the ''Treaty on Reduction of Military Forces in Border Regions'' in a meeting in [[Moscow]].

Subsequent annual summits of the Shanghai Five group occurred in [[Almaty]] (Kazakhstan) in 1998, in [[Bishkek]] (Kyrgyzstan) in 1999, and in [[Dushanbe]] (Tajikistan) in 2000.

In 2001, the annual summit returned to [[Shanghai]], [[China]]. There the five member nations first admitted [[Uzbekistan]] in the Shanghai Five mechanism (thus transforming it into the Shanghai Six). Then all six heads of state signed on June 15, 2001, the ''Declaration of Shanghai Cooperation Organisation'', praising the role played thus far by the Shanghai Five mechanism and aiming to transform it to a higher level of cooperation. In July 2001, Russia and the PRC, the organisation's two leading nations, signed the [[Treaty of Good-Neighbourliness and Friendly Cooperation Between the People's Republic of China and the Russian Federation|Treaty of Good-Neighbourliness and Friendly Cooperation]]. 

In June 2002, the heads of the SCO member states met in [[Saint Petersburg]], Russia. There they signed the SCO Charter which expounded on the organisation's purposes, principles, structures and form of operation, and established it officially from the point of view of international law.

==Structure==
The Council of Heads of State is the top decision-making body in the SCO. This council meets at the SCO summits, which are held each year in one of the member states' capital cities. The current Council of Heads of State consists of: 

* [[Kurmanbek Bakiyev]] (Kyrgyzstan)
* [[Hu Jintao]] (People's Republic of China)
* [[Islom Karimov]] (Uzbekistan) 
* [[Nursultan Nazarbayev]] (Kazakhstan)
* [[Dmitry Medvedev]] (Russia)
* [[Emomalii Rahmon]] (Tajikistan)  
[[Image:Structure of the SCO.png|right|550px]]
The Council of Heads of Government is the second-highest council in the organisation. This council also holds annual summits, at which time members discuss issues of multilateral cooperation. The council also approves the organisation's budget. 

The council of Foreign Ministers also hold regular meetings, where they discuss the current international situation and the SCO's interaction with other international organisations.<ref>[http://www.malaysia.mid.ru/press2007/e_22.html Session of the Council of Foreign Ministers from Member States of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation] Embassy of the Russian Federation in Malaysia</ref> 

As the name suggests, the Council of National Coordinators coordinates the multilateral cooperation of member states within the framework of the SCO's charter.

The Secretariat of the SCO is the primary executive body of the organisation. It serves to implement organisational decisions and decrees, drafts proposed documents (such as declarations and agendas), function as a document depository for the organisation, arranges specific activities within the SCO framework, and promotes and disseminates information about the SCO. It is located in Beijing. The current SCO Secretary-General is [[Bolat Nurgaliyev]] of Kazakhstan.<ref>[http://www.sectsco.org/html/00037.html SCO Secretariat in Brief] SCO Website</ref>

The Regional Anti-Terrorist Structure (RATS), headquartered in [[Tashkent]], Uzbekistan, is a permanent organ of the SCO which serves to promote cooperation of member states against the [[three evils]] of [[terrorism]], [[separatism]] and [[extremism]]. The Head of RATS is elected to a three-year term. Each member state also sends a permanent representative to RATS.<ref>[http://www.sectsco.org/fk-03.html Information on Regional Anti-Terrorist Structure of Shanghai Cooperation Organisation] SCO Website</ref>

==Activities==
[[Image:Putin and Hu JintaoPeace Mission 2007.jpg|thumb|left|250px|SCO leaders at Peace Mission 2007. [[Hu Jintao]], [[Vladimir Putin]], [[Nursultan Nazarbayev]] and [[Islom Karimov]]]]
===Cooperation on security===
The SCO is primarily centred on its member nations' [[Central Asia]]n security-related concerns, often describing the main threats it confronts as being [[terrorism]], [[separatism]] and [[extremism]]. However evidence is growing that its activities in the area of social development of its member states is increasing fast.{{Fact|date=September 2008}}

At the June 16-17 2004 SCO summit, held in [[Tashkent]], [[Uzbekistan]], the Regional Antiterrorism Structure (RATS) was established. On 21 April 2006, the SCO announced plans to fight cross-border drug crimes under the counter-terrorism rubric.<ref>[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2006-04/22/content_4459199.htm SCO to intensify fight against cross-border drug crimes] Xinhua.net</ref>

Grigory Logninov claimed in April 2006 that the SCO has no plans to become a military bloc; nonetheless he argued that the increased threats of "terrorism, extremism and separatism" make necessary a full-scale involvement of armed forces.<ref>[http://www.studentpa.info/spip.php?article248 SCO gets ready for joint military exercise] World Student Press Agency</ref>

There have been a number of SCO joint military exercises. The first of these was held in 2003, with the first phase taking place in Kazakhstan and the second in China.<ref name="exercise">[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2006-04/26/content_4476403.htm SCO to stage joint anti-terror military exercise in 2007] Xinhua.net</ref>

On a larger scale, but outside the SCO framework, the first ever joint military exercise between the [[People's Republic of China|PRC]] and [[Russia]], called [[Peace Mission 2005]] started on August 19, 2005. Following their successful completion, Russian officials have begun speaking of India joining such exercises in the future and the SCO taking on a military role.

The joint military exercises in 2007 (known as "Peace Mission 2007") took place in [[Chelyabinsk]] Russia, near the [[Ural Mountains]] and close to Central Asia, as was agreed upon on April 2006 at a meeting of SCO Defence Ministers. More than 4,000 soldiers participated from China. Air forces and precision-guided weapons were have likely to be used. Russian Defence Minister [[Sergei Ivanov]] said that the exercises will be transparent and open to media and the public.<ref name="exercise"/><ref>[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2006-04/27/content_4479247.htm SCO's anti-terrorism military drill to be transparent] Xinhua.net</ref>

In October 2007, the SCO signed an agreement with the [[Collective Security Treaty Organisation]] (CSTO), in the Tajik capital Dushanbe, to broaden cooperation on issues such as security, crime, and drug trafficking.<ref>[http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2007%5C10%5C06%5Cstory_6-10-2007_pg4_3 Security alliances led by Russia, China link up] Daily Times</ref> Joint action plans between the two organisations are planned to be signed by early 2008 in Beijing.<ref>[http://jamestown.org/edm/article.php?article_id=2372661 Kazakhstan Notes Afghanistan's Emerging Security Agenda] Eurasia Daily Monitor</ref>

===Economic cooperation===
All SCO members but China are also members of the [[Eurasian Economic Community]]. A Framework Agreement to enhance economic cooperation was signed by the SCO member states on 23 September 2003. At the same meeting the [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|PRC's Premier]], [[Wen Jiabao]], proposed a long-term objective to establish a [[free trade area]] in the SCO, while other more immediate measures would be taken to improve the flow of goods in the region.<ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0WDP/is_2003_Sept_29/ai_108316611 Central Asian powers agree to pursue free-trade zone]</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ictsd.org/weekly/03-10-01/story3.htm |title= China Intensifies Regional Trade Talks |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071024121832/http://www.ictsd.org/weekly/03-10-01/story3.htm |archivedate=2007-10-24}}  International Centre for Trade and Sustainable Development (ICTSD)</ref> A follow up plan with 100 specific actions was signed one year later, on September 23, 2004.<ref>[http://www.shaps.hawaii.edu/fp/russia/2004/20040923_sco_jc.html Joint Communique of the Council of the Governmental Heads (Prime Ministers) of Shanghai Cooperation Organisation Member States] University of Hawaii</ref>

On 26 October 2005, the [[Moscow]] Summit of the SCO, the Secretary General of the Organisation said that the SCO will prioritise joint energy projects; such will include the oil and gas sector, the exploration of new hydrocarbon reserves, and joint use of water resources. The creation of an Inter-bank SCO Council was also agreed upon at that summit in order to fund future joint projects. The first meeting of the SCO Interbank Association was held in Beijing on 21-22 February 2006.<ref>[http://www.jamestown.org/edm/article.php?article_id=2370411 Shanghai Cooperation Organisation Eyes Economic, Security Cooperation] The Jamestown Foundation</ref><ref>[http://eng.nbu.com/news/read.php?id=421 SCO Ministers of Foreign Economic Activity and Trade to meet in Tashkent] National Bank of Uzbekistan</ref> On 30 November 2006, at ''The SCO: Results and Perspectives'', an international conference held in [[Almaty]], the representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry announced that Russia is developing plans for an SCO "Energy Club".<ref>[http://eng.gazeta.kz/art.asp?aid=84086 Russia's Foreign Ministry develops concept of SCO energy club] Gazeta.kz</ref>.

On 16 June, 2009, at the Yekaterinburg Summit, China announced plans to provide a US$10 billion loan to SCO member states to shore up the struggling economies of its members amid the global financial crisis. <ref>[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-06/16/content_11552439.htm (Xinhua)]</ref><ref>http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5ghofWsw6596hiWFv-WS4u6L84TGAD98RLUG80</ref> The summit was held together with the first [[BRIC]] summit, and the China-Russia joint statement said that they want a bigger quota in the [[IMF]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Yan |title=China, Russia sign five-point joint statement |date=June 18, 2009 |accessdate=June 23, 2009 |quote=They also said that a new round of the IMF quota formula review and the reform schemes of the World Bank should be completed on time and that the emerging markets and developing countries should have a bigger say and broader representation in the international financial institutions.  |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-06/18/content_11558133.htm}}</ref>

===Cultural cooperation===
Cultural cooperation also occurs in the SCO framework. Culture ministers of the SCO met for the first time in [[Beijing]] on 12 April 2002, signing a joint statement for continued cooperation. The third meeting of the Culture Ministers took place in [[Tashkent]], Uzbekistan, on 27-28 April 2006.<ref>[http://english.people.com.cn/200204/13/eng20020413_93954.shtml Culture Ministers of SCO Member States Meet in Beijing] People's Daily</ref><ref>[http://eng.gazeta.kz/art.asp?aid=74059 SCO Culture Ministers to Meet in Tashkent] Gazeta.kz</ref>

Kazakhstan has also suggested an SCO [[folk dance]] festival to take place in 2008, in [[Astana]].<ref>[http://www.kazind.com/newsarchives/newsvol66.html Kazakhstan Backs Promotion of SCO Cultural Ties] Embassy of Kazakhstan in India</ref>

==Summits==
According to the Charter of the SCO, summits of the Council of Heads of State shall be held annually at alternating venues. The locations of these summits follow the alphabetical order of the member state's name in Russian.<ref name=charter>[http://www.sectsco.org/html/00096.html Charter of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation] SCO Website</ref> The charter also dictates that the Council of Heads of Government (that is, the Prime Ministers) shall meet annually in a place previously decided upon by the council members.

==Future membership possibilities==
Currently, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation does not have an official mechanism for admitting new members.<ref>[http://www.interfax.kz/?lang=eng&int_id=10&function=view&news_id=1982 Moratorium on SCO expansion unlikely to be lifted in near future - source] Interfax Kazakhstan</ref> Several states, however, participate as observers, some of whom have expressed interest in becoming full members in the future.

*{{MNG}} became the first country to receive observer status at the 2004 Tashkent Summit. [[Pakistan]], [[India]] and [[Iran]] received observer status at the 2005 SCO summit in [[Astana]], Kazakhstan on 5 July, 2005.

*{{PAK}} currently has observer status in the SCO. In recent times, Pakistan has tried to improve its relations with [[Russia]]. Pakistan also quietly backed Russia in its war against Georgia during the [[2008 South Ossetia war]]. Former Pakistani President [[Pervez Musharraf]] argued in favour of Pakistan's qualification to join the organisation as a full member during a joint summit with China in 2006. China said that it would convey Pakistan<U+2019>s desire to all SCO member states. In turn, Musharraf was formally invited to the sixth summit of the SCO to take place in [[Shanghai]] in June. The [[Prime Minister of Pakistan]] [[Yousaf Raza Gillani]] once again argued in favour of Pakistan qualification to join the organization as a full member<ref>http://geo.tv/10-14-2009/50915.htm</ref>.  

Pakistan and Iran have been lobbying for full membership, while India and Mongolia have not shown strong interest in becoming official members.<ref name=expand>[http://www.cacianalyst.org/?q=node/4697 SCO Fails to Solve Its Expansion Dilemma] Central Asia-Caucasus Institute</ref> Russia's permanent representative in the SCO Secretariat Grigory Longinov has claimed that the enlargement of the SCO is impeded by "an immature mechanism of admission of new members", while Secretary General [[Zhang Deguang]] argued that an over-expansion might hinder the intensification of the cooperation.<ref>[http://news.uzreport.com/mir.cgi?lan=e&id=9086 SCO has immature mechanism of new members admission - official] UzReport</ref>

===Dialogue Partner===
The position of Dialogue Partner was created in 2008 in accordance with Article 14 of the SCO Charter of 7 June 2002. This article regards Dialogue Partner as a state or an organisation who shares the goals and principles of the SCO and wishes to establish relations of equal mutually beneficial partnership with the Organisation.<ref>[http://www.sectsco.org/EN/show.asp?id=64 Regulations on the Status of Dialogue Partner of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation]</ref>

Sri Lanka is located in an extremely strategically valued location in the world.  China is currently building a harbor in the Sri Lankan town of Hambantota, widely seen as a naval base Chinese ships re-fueling and protecting its naval interests.  Sri Lanka recently defeated the separatist LTTE with the cooperation of Shanghai Cooperation Members China and Russia.{{Fact|date=October 2009}}

===Other countries===
*{{AFG}}, while not an observer, is currently part of the SCO-Afghanistan Contact Group. The contact group was established in November 2005, and serves as a mechanism for SCO member states to jointly contribute to reconstruction and stability in Afghanistan.<ref>[http://english.people.com.cn/90001/90777/6245785.html SCO, Afghanistan need to deepen cooperation, secretary general] People's Daily</ref>

*{{BLR}} applied for observer status in the organisation and was promised Kazakhstan's support towards that goal.{{Fact|date=April 2008}} However, Russian Defence Minister [[Sergei Ivanov]] voiced doubt on the probability of Belarus' membership, saying that Belarus was a purely European country.<ref name=bel>[http://www.kommersant.com/page.asp?idr=527&id=670100 The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation acquires military character] Kommersant</ref> Despite this, Belarus was accepted as a Dialogue Partner at the 2009 SCO Summit.

==Relations with the West==
[[Image:Current Major Military Alliances.png|left|350px]]
Although the declaration on the establishment of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation contained a statement that it "is not an alliance directed against other states and regions and it adheres to the principle of openness", many observers believe that one of the original purposes of the SCO was to serve as a counterbalance to [[NATO]] and the [[United States]] and in particular to avoid conflicts that would allow the United States to intervene in areas bordering both [[Russia]] and [[China]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Tannock|first=Charles|title=Backing Kazakhstan's 'great game'|publisher=Guardian Weekly|date=February 18, 2008|url=http://commentisfree.guardian.co.uk/charles_tannock/2008/02/backing_kazakhstans_great_game_.html}}</ref><ref>Fels, Enrico (2009), ''Assessing Eurasia's Powerhouse.

At the Astana summit in July 2005, with the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq foreshadowing an indefinite presence of U.S. forces in Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan, the SCO urged the U.S. to set a timetable for withdrawing its troops from SCO member states. Shortly afterwards, Uzbekistan asked the U.S. to leave the [[Karshi-Khanabad|K-2 air base]],<ref>[http://www.hindu.com/2005/07/08/stories/2005070800711400.htm Central Asia: China and Russia up the ante] The Hindu</ref>.

Recently the SCO has made no direct comments against the U.S. or its military presence in the region. However, several indirect statements at the past summits, including the 2007 summit in [[Bishkek]], have been viewed as "thinly veiled swipes at Washington".<ref>[http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/insight/articles/eav082007a.shtml Shanghai Cooperation Organisation Summiteers Take Shots at US Presence in Central Asia] Eurasianet</ref>
