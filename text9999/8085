'''Villa Park''' is an [[association football]] [[stadium]] in the district of [[Witton, West Midlands|Witton]], [[Birmingham]], England with a [[seating capacity]] of 42,786. It has been the home of [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa Football Club]] since 1897. The team previously played at Aston Park from 1874 to 1876 and [[Perry Barr]] from 1876 to 1897. The ground is less than a mile from both [[Witton railway station|Witton]] and [[Aston railway station]]s and has hosted sixteen [[England national football team|England internationals]] at senior level, the first in 1899 and the most recent in 2005. It was the first English ground to stage international football in three different centuries. Villa Park has hosted more [[Football Association Challenge Cup]] (FA Cup) semi-finals than any other stadium, having hosted 55 matches in total.

In 1897 Aston Villa moved into the Aston Lower Grounds, a sports ground in a [[Victorian era|Victorian]] [[amusement park]] situated in the former grounds of [[Aston Hall]], a [[Jacobean architecture|Jacobean]] stately home. Prior to the purchase of the freehold in 1911, the ground was rented for <U+00A3>300 per annum. Over the course of its history the stadium has gone through various stages of renovation and development, resulting in the current stand configuration of the Holte End, Trinity Road Stand, North Stand and the Doug Ellis Stand. The club has initial [[planning permission]] to redevelop the North Stand, which will increase the capacity of Villa Park from 42,786 to approximately 50,000.

Before 1914 a cycling track ran around the perimeter of the pitch where regular cycling meetings were hosted as well as athletic events. Aside from football-related uses, the stadium has seen various concerts staged along with other sporting events including boxing matches and international [[rugby league]] and [[rugby union]] matches. The last ever final of the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|European Cup Winners' Cup]], the [[1999 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup Final]], took place at Villa Park.

==History==
The Aston Lower Grounds, later renamed Villa Park, was not the first home of Aston Villa F.C. Their previous venue, the Perry Barr ground faced increasing problems including a lack of access and exorbitant rents.<ref name=Inglis26>Inglis, Simon (1997), p.26</ref><ref name=holt124>Holt, Frank; Bishop, Rob, p.124</ref> As a result, in 1894, Villa's committee began negotiations with the owners of the Aston Lower Grounds, "the finest sports ground in the district."<ref name=Inglis26/> Situated in the former grounds of Aston Hall, a Jacobean stately home,<ref name="Inglis">Inglis, Simon (1984), pp.176<U+2013>179</ref> the Lower Grounds had seen varied uses over the years. Originally the [[kitchen garden]] of Aston Hall's owner [[Thomas Holte|Sir Thomas Holte]], the man who gave his name to the Holte End stand, it later became a Victorian amusement park complete with aquarium and great hall. The current pitch stands on the site of the Dovehouse Pool, an ornamental pond drained in 1889. In place of the pool the owners of the Lower Grounds built a cycle track and sports ground that opened on 10 June 1889 for a combined cycling and athletics event that drew an estimated crowd of 15,000.<ref>Inglis, Simon (1997), p.58</ref> Negotiations continued for two years before the Villa committee reached agreement with the site's owner, Edgar Flower, to rent the Lower Grounds for <U+00A3>300 per annum on a 21-year lease with an option to buy the site at any point during the term.<ref>Inglis, Simon (1997), p.70</ref> The committee immediately engaged an architect who began preparing plans for the site, which included construction of a new {{convert|440|yd|m|abbr=off}} cement cycle track to replace the existing cinder one. The main stand was to be built to the east on the Witton Lane side, with the track and pitch fully enclosed by banking. Construction of the final phase of the stadium began in the winter of 1896 following negotiations with contractors over the price.<ref>Inglis, Simon (1997), p.72</ref> Several months behind schedule, the almost-complete stadium finally opened on 17 April 1897. The process of fixing issues with the building work would continue for a number of months thereafter.<ref>Inglis, Simon (1997), pp.79<U+2013>80</ref> As built, the stadium could house 40,000 spectators, most of whom would stand in the open on the banking.<ref name="Inglis"/> The first match at the ground, a friendly against [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]], took place on 17 April 1897, one week after Aston Villa had completed the [[Football League First Division|League]] and [[FA Cup]] '[[Double (association football)|Double]]'.<ref name="Inglis"/>
[[File:Holte Hotel.JPG|thumb|upright|left|The Holte Hotel behind the Holte End, part of the original Aston Lower Grounds, refurbished in 2006]]
After winning the league championship in 1899, Villa's record-breaking average crowd of 21,000<ref>Inglis, Simon (1997) p.85</ref> allowed the club to invest in a two-stage ground improvement programme. The first stage extended the terrace covering on the Trinity Road side at a cost of <U+00A3>887 while the second cost <U+00A3>1,300 and involved re-laying all terracing around the track to remedy a design flaw that caused poor sightlines for the majority of the crowd. In 1911, Villa bought the freehold of the ground for <U+00A3>8,250, the office buildings in the old aquarium and car park area for <U+00A3>1,500 and the carriage drive and [[bowling green]] for <U+00A3>2,000.<ref name="Inglis"/> This was the first stage in plans drawn up by ambitious Villa director [[Frederick Rinder]], that would see the capacity of Villa Park increased to 104,000.<ref>Inglis, Simon (1997) p.102</ref> In June 1914, another phase of enhancements began at Villa Park to compete with improvements at other grounds around the country, including [[Everton F.C.|Everton]]'s [[Goodison Park]], where a new two-tiered stand had just been completed. The first stage of improvements saw the cycling track removed, new banking at the Holte Hotel End (Holte End) and a re-profiling of all the terracing to bring it closer to the newly squared-off pitch. Rinder turned to the renowned architect [[Archibald Leitch]] to design a new Villa Park. Their joint plans included large banked end stands at the Holte and Witton ends and the incorporation of the original Victorian Lower Grounds buildings, including the aquarium and the newly acquired bowling greens. The outbreak of the [[First World War]] severely hampered design and construction efforts.<ref>Inglis, Simon (1997) p.110</ref>  

As a result of the worsening economic situation, 1919 quotes for the implementation of the pre-war construction plans came to <U+00A3>66,000, compared to the 1914 quote of <U+00A3>27,000. By March 1922 this price had reduced to <U+00A3>41,775 and the directors pushed ahead with the plans for the new Trinity Road Stand.<ref>Inglis, Simon (1997) pp.112<U+2013>113</ref> Construction began in April 1922 with the stand partially opened in August that year. Construction continued throughout the 1922<U+2013>23 season with the stand officially opened on 26 January 1924 by the then [[Duke of York]], later King [[George VI of the United Kingdom|George VI]]. He commented to Rinder that he had "no idea that a ground so finely equipped in every way<U+2014>and devoted to football<U+2014>existed."<ref>Inglis, Simon (1997), p.118</ref> On completion the Trinity Road Stand was considered one of the grandest in Britain, complete with stained glass windows, Italian mosaics, [[Dutch gable]]s in the style of Aston Hall and a sweeping staircase. Several commentators including [[Simon Inglis]] consider it to be Leitch's masterpiece, described in 1960 by a ''[[Sunday Times]]'' reporter as the "[[St Pancras railway station|St Pancras]] of football."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/article382300.ece |title=Man who built his place in history |last=Whitehead |first=Richard |newspaper=The Times |date=18 April 2005 |accessdate=28 October 2007}}</ref> The final cost of the stand and associated 1922<U+2013>24 ground developments was calculated at <U+00A3>89,000, a sum that enraged the club's directors who ordered an investigation into cost and in 1925 forced the resignation of Rinder.<ref>Inglis, Simon (1997), pp.119<U+2013>122</ref>
[[File:Villa Park 1907.jpg|thumb|right|Villa Park during a match against Liverpool in 1907; the ground is yet to be squared off and the cycle track can still be seen.]] 
Villa Park was to remain in much the same state for another 30 years with no major developments until the late 1950s. During the 1930s the earth and timber terraces with wooden crash barriers were completely replaced by concrete terracing and metal barriers, a process first begun by Rinder. In 1936 he was voted back onto the board at the age of 78 after the club were relegated to the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]]. Nearly 25 years after he had created his 1914 masterplan, Rinder resurrected it and looked to carry out the third phase of his developments. He died in December 1938 after Leitch who had died in April 1938, leaving his construction business to his son, Archibald Junior. The complete redevelopment and extension of the Holte End began in early 1939 supervised by Archibald Junior. When the [[Second World War]] broke out in September 1939, all construction across the country stopped. Unusually, given the austerity measures in place at the time, Villa acquired a special permit to continue construction of the Holte End; Simon Inglis notes "How they achieved this is not recorded."<ref name=Inglis138>Inglis, Simon (1997), pp.138<U+2013>139</ref> Work on the ground was completed by April 1940 and the stand was immediately mothballed as Villa Park switched to its war time role. The Trinity Road Stand became an [[air-raid shelter]] and ammunition store while the home dressing room became the temporary home of a rifle company from the 9th Battalion, [[Royal Warwickshire Regiment]].<ref name=holt128/> German bombs caused <U+00A3>20,000 worth of damage to the Witton Lane Stand, which was not remedied until 1954.<ref>Inglis, Simon (1997), p.144</ref>

Apart from running repairs and fixing bomb damage, no major projects were undertaken until 1958<U+2013>59 when four projects were announced. As a result, the old Bowling Green pavilion on the Trinity Road became a medical centre, the basement of the aquarium building was converted into a gym, four large floodlight pylons were installed and a training ground was purchased {{convert|500|yd|m|abbr=off}} from Villa Park.<ref>Inglis, Simon (1997), p.148</ref> The floodlights were first used in November 1958 for a friendly match against the Scottish side [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.|Heart of Midlothian]].<ref name="Inglis"/><ref name=Hayes172>Hayes, Dean, p.172</ref> In the summer of 1962, <U+00A3>40,000 was spent on a roof for the Holte End, the first to provide cover for the ordinary terrace fans at Villa Park since 1922. The old barrel-shaped roof on the Witton Lane Stand, the only remaining feature of the 1897 Villa Park, was removed in the summer of 1963 and replaced with a plain sloping roof in the same style as the Holte End.<ref name="Inglis"/> Villa Park was chosen by [[FIFA]] to host three matches for the [[1966 World Cup]] on the condition that the Witton Lane Stand became all-seater. The players' tunnel also required covering with a cage while the pitch was to be widened by {{convert|3|yd|m|abbr=off}}.<ref>Inglis, Simon (1997), pp.153<U+2013>155</ref> Regular ground developments and innovations began in the summer of 1969 under the direction of the new chairman, [[Doug Ellis]], who set about redeveloping Villa Park for the modern era. Much of the stadium had fallen into various states of disrepair and was in need of modernisation.<ref name="Inglis 162">Inglis, Simon (1997), p.162</ref> Ellis updated the infrastructure, installed a new public address system, carried out plumbing work, which included installing new toilets, resurfaced the terraces and built a new ticket office. His tenure also saw executive lounges replace the old offices in the Trinity Road Stand.<ref name="Inglis 162"/>

Redevelopment of the Witton End stand began in the summer of 1976. The stand had not seen any major work since 1924 and its rear remained a mound of earth. Initial renovations saw the levelling of the earthen mound and new concrete terraces constructed on the lower tier in preparation for the construction of an upper tier. Stage two began in February 1977 and was officially opened in late October that year. The stand's design and fittings were impressive for the time, including novelties such as an 'AV' logo spelled out in coloured seats and a double row of [[Luxury box|executive boxes]].<ref name=Hayes172/> As well as the new Witton End stand, renamed the North Stand, Villa Park went through further renovations throughout the ground. The cost of the work was <U+00A3>1.3 million. As a result and as with the construction of the Trinity Road Stand fifty years earlier, Villa were again burdened with debt. An internal investigation found that <U+00A3>700,000 of the <U+00A3>1.3 million worth of bills were unaccounted for.<ref name=Hayes172/> A later report by accountants [[Deloitte Haskins & Sells]] found that the bills were inflated by only 10% but that there were "serious breaches of recommended codes of practice and poor site supervision."<ref>Inglis, Simon (1997), p.188</ref> 

[[File:Facade of the Holte End stand, Villa Park.jpg|thumb|left|The brick facade of the Holte End, constructed in 1994]]
In response to the [[Hillsborough disaster]], the [[Taylor Report]] of August 1989 mandated that all major stadia be converted to become [[All-seater stadium|all-seater]] as a safety measure. During the summer of 1990, the first changes were made to comply with the report's requirements. The North Stand saw the addition of 2,900 seats to the lower tier of the stand in place of terracing, the Holte End's roof was extended in preparation for more seats, the Trinity Road Stand had its roof replaced and the Witton Lane Stand had more [[Luxury box|corporate boxes]] added. By that time, all four floodlight pylons had been removed to make way for boxes or in preparation for seating and new floodlights were installed on new gantries on the Trinity and Witton stands.<ref name="Inglis 194-197">Inglis, Simon (1997), pp.194<U+2013>197</ref> In February 1992, the club's application to the Council for permission to demolish the Holte Hotel was rejected. After several months of negotiations, Villa gained permission for a new stand to replace the Witton Lane Stand. The new design meant that the club had to realign Witton Lane and, as a condition of the planning permission, pay <U+00A3>600,000 to [[compulsory purchase]] the houses along Witton Lane and upgrade the road from a [[B roads in Great Britain|B]] to an [[A roads in Great Britain|A road]], as well as moving its utilities.<ref name="Inglis 194-197"/> The stand was fully operational by January 1994 at a cost of <U+00A3>5 million with 4,686 seats, which brought Villa Park up to a capacity of 46,005.<ref name=Inglis203>Inglis, Simon (1997) p.203</ref> It was announced at the 70th birthday gala of chairman Doug Ellis that the stand was to be renamed the "Doug Ellis Stand", a move that caused some controversy among Villa fans with some still referring to it as the Witton Lane Stand. Nevertheless, during the 1993<U+2013>94 season, the newly rebuilt Witton Lane Stand became the Doug Ellis Stand.<ref name=Hayes172/> The Holte End was the only remaining stand that did not meet the Taylor Report requirements and a structural survey revealed that putting seats onto the existing terracing would be uneconomical. Instead the decision was taken to build a new stand consisting of two tiers, just four years after construction of the new roof.<ref name=Inglis203/> The demolition of the stand began on the last day of the 1994 season. Its replacement began to open in August 1994 with 3,000 seats in the lower tier occupied for the first seating-only game at Villa Park. By December the same year it was fully operational and had a capacity of 13,501 seats, bringing the Villa Park capacity to 40,310. Upon completion, the Holte was the largest single end stand in Britain.<ref name=Inglis205>Inglis, Simon (1997), p.205</ref>

The next development at Villa Park was the Trinity Road Stand in 2000. It had stood since 1922 though it had seen a number of renovations and additions since. The demolition of the old stand began after the last game of the [[1999-2000 in English football|1999<U+2013>2000 season]], an event met with an element of sadness from observers such as Simon Inglis who stated that "the landscape of English football will never be the same."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2000/may/14/newsstory.sport8 |title=Last rites for the holy Trinity |last=Inglis |first=Simon |newspaper=The Observer |date=14 May 2000 |accessdate=8 November 2010}}</ref> The new stand was much larger and more spacious than the old one, taking Villa's capacity from 39,399 to its present 42,786. It was officially opened in November 2001 by [[HRH The Prince of Wales]], just as the old stand had been opened by his grandfather George VI, 77 years earlier, when he was still the [[Duke of York]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/1651763.stm |title=Royal football visit replayed |date=11 November 2001 |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |accessdate=23 September 2007}}</ref>

==Structure and facilities==
[[File:Villa Park stands.jpg|thumb|right|A diagram showing the alignment of stands at Villa Park]]
Villa Park comprises 42,789 seats split between four stands.<ref name="fact"/> These four stands are the Holte End to the South, the Trinity Road Stand to the West, the Doug Ellis Stand opposite the Trinity Road Stand, and the North Stand behind the northern goal.<ref name="fact"/> All of the stands are composed of two tiers except the Trinity Road Stand, which has three.

The Holte End is a large two-tiered stand at the south end of the stadium. Originally a large terraced banking providing accommodation for more than 20,000 spectators, the current incarnation was constructed in 1994<U+2013>95 and consists of two tiers with no executive boxes. The two tiers are slightly curved in a parabola to provide good sightlines from all seats while inside there are three levels of spacious concourse area as well as the Holte Suite, a large hospitality room for supporters.<ref name="Inglis new Holte"/> The roof is a variant of the "King Truss" system and the front third slopes slightly forward.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.grandstands.net/canopy_roof.htm |title=Canopy and roof variations |publisher=ReidSteel |accessdate=28 October 2007}}</ref> Two large staircases, pediments, Dutch gables and a mosaic introduced in the 2007 season in the style of the old Trinity Road Stand make up the facade, itself inspired by Aston Hall.<ref name="Inglis new Holte">Inglis, Simon (1997), p.207</ref> The Holte End is the most renowned stand at Villa Park amongst home and away team supporters.<ref name="fact"/> Traditionally Villa's most vocal and passionate supporters gather here, including some Aston Villa [[Football hooliganism|hooligan firms]].<ref>Brown, Brittle (2006), p.1</ref> 
[[File:The Holte End.jpg|thumb|left|The two-tiered stand, the Holte End]]

Built in 2000, the main Trinity Road Stand is the most recently completed at Villa Park and houses the dressing rooms, club offices and director's boxes. The stand is composed of three tiers with a row of executive boxes between the second and third tiers. Although much larger than the other stands, the stand has roughly the same roof level as the other three sides. The players' tunnel and the technical area where the managers and substitutes sit during the match are in the middle of the stand at pitch level. The press and the directors' VIP area are situated in the centre of the middle tier. The upper tiers of the stand extend over Trinity Road, the street that cuts behind the ground. Cars travelling along Trinity Road have to pass through what is effectively a tunnel formed by the Trinity Road Stand.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/cs/Satellite?c=Page&childpagename=Development-Planning%2FPageLayout&cid=1223092558695&pagename=BCC%2FCommon%2FWrapper%2FWrapper |title=Aston Local Plan |publisher=Birmingham City Council |accessdate=3 April 2011}}</ref>

[[File:Facade of Trinity Road Stand, Villa Park.jpg|thumb|right|The facade of the new Trinity Road Stand, built over the Trinity Road]]
The oldest stand at Villa Park is the North Stand, formerly known as the Witton End, completed in 1977. It is a two-tiered stand, with a double row of 39 executive boxes running between the two tiers. Upper tier seats are claret with "AV" written in blue while the lower tier consists of sky blue seats. The North Stand was "the first major stand in Britain to use what is now broadly termed the 'goalpost' structure."<ref name=Inglis184>Inglis, Simon (1997), p.184<U+2013>185</ref> The facade of the stand is a "textured concrete render" typical of the time.<ref name=Inglis184/> Since the segregation of supporters in the 1970s, away fans had been situated in the lower tier of the North Stand. Former manager [[Martin O'Neill]] expressed his desire to have Villa fans seated in the North Stand to improve the atmosphere at Villa Park. For the start of the [[2007-08 in English football|2007<U+2013>08 season]] the club released cut-price season tickets for the lower tier of the stand. This meant moving the away fans to the northern end of the Doug Ellis Stand across both tiers.<ref name="cheap seats">{{cite news |url=http://www.birminghampost.net/midlands-birmingham-sport/west-midlands-sports/tm_headline=villa-ready-to-open-the-cheap-seats&method=full&objectid=19290019&siteid=50002-name_page.html |title=Villa ready to open the cheap seats |date=13 June 2007 |last=Smith |first=Lisa |newspaper=Birmingham Post |accessdate=9 November 2010}}</ref> The Doug Ellis Stand, formerly known as the Witton Lane Stand, is a two-tiered stand with a row of executive boxes dividing the tiers. The roof was originally planned to be a goalpost structure, the same as the Holte End and North Stand, but the plans were changed to a simpler cantilever design. It saw slight refurbishment prior to the 1996 European Championships to join the corners with the lower tier of the North Stand, improve leg-room and increase the curve of the terracing to improve sightlines.<ref name=Inglis184/> The main television camera viewpoint is situated here, so televised matches at Villa Park take the point of view of a fan who is sitting on the half-way line in the Doug Ellis Stand. 

In the south-west corner, between the Holte End and the Trinity Road Stand, there is a three-storey pavilion-like structure, which is used for corporate hospitality. There is also a large television screen in the same location. On 28 November 2009, a bronze statue of former Villa chairman and founder of the [[Football League]], [[William McGregor (football)|William McGregor]] was unveiled outside the stadium.<ref name="stat">{{cite news |url=http://www.birminghammail.net/birmingham-sport/aston-villa-fc/aston-villa-news/2008/04/03/william-mcgregor-statue-a-step-closer-thanks-to-aston-villa-supporters-97319-20714293/ |title=William McGregor statue a step closer thanks to Aston Villa supporters |newspaper=Birmingham Mail |date=3 April 2008 |accessdate=16 July 2008}}</ref><ref name="BP">{{cite news |url=http://www.birminghampost.net/midlands-birmingham-sport/west-midlands-sports/aston-villa-fc/2008/04/02/aston-villa-fans-approve-statue-of-first-chairman-65233-20711503/ |title=Aston Villa fans approve statue of first chairman |newspaper=Birmingham Post |date=2 April 2008 |last=Smith |first=Lisa |accessdate=16 July 2008}}</ref> Behind the North Stand is the "Villa Village" made up of club  and ticket offices as well as a club shop.

==Future==
[[File:Facade of North Stand, Villa Park.jpg|thumb|right|The concrete facade of the North Stand, the oldest stand at Villa Park]]
