The '''2010 G-20 Toronto summit''' was the [[List of G-20 summits|fourth meeting]] of the [[G-20 major economies|G-20]] [[Head of government|heads of government]], in discussion of the [[global financial system]] and the [[world economy]], which took place at the [[Metro Toronto Convention Centre]] in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada, during June 26<U+2013>27, 2010. The summit's priorities included evaluating the progress of financial reform, developing sustainable stimulus measures,<ref>http://www.economicsummits.info/2010/03/harpers-comments-to-the-sherpas-document/</ref> debating [[bank tax|global bank tax]],<ref>{{cite news|author=Canada |url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/g8-g20/background-summit-issues/article1547024/ |title=Background: Summit Issues |publisher=Globe and Mail |date=April 28, 2010 |accessdate=2010-06-20}}</ref> and promoting [[open market]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pm.gc.ca/eng/media.asp?id=3209 |title=Prime Minister of Canada: Statement by the Prime Minister of Canada |publisher=Pm.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=2010-05-20}}</ref> Alongside the twenty-one representatives of the G-20 major economies, leaders of six invited nations, and eight additional [[intergovernmental organization]]s also took part in the summit.

Prior to the summit, [[Prime Minister of Canada|Canadian prime minister]] [[Stephen Harper]] announced that the theme of the Toronto summit would be "recovery and new beginnings," referring to an anticipated [[economic stimulus]] from the impact of the [[Late-2000s recession|ongoing world recession]].<ref>http://www.economicsummits.info/2010/03/harpers-comments-to-the-sherpas-document/</ref> The summit was initially proposed to be held in the town of [[Huntsville, Ontario]], where the immediately preceding [[36th G8 summit]] was set to be held. The town was later deemed insufficient to provide hospitality for the large number of G-20 delegates and journalists, thus the summit was later finalized to take place in Toronto.<ref name=washingtonexaminer1>{{cite web|author=6:26 EDT |url=http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/world/canada-says-spending-nearly-1-billion-on-security-for-g-8-and-g-20-summits-is-worth-it-95107194.html |title=Canada says spending nearly {{Nowrap|$1 billion}} on security for G8 and G-20 summits is worth it |publisher=Washington Examiner |date=2010-05-28 |accessdate=2010-06-04}}</ref>

==Agenda==
Many leaders of the [[G-20 major economies|G-20]] were divided among different issues that they wanted to discuss at the summit.<ref>Wolverson, Roya. [http://www.cfr.org/publication/22542/g20s_twenty_agendas.html?breadcrumb=%2Fpublication%2Fby_type%2Fbackgrounder "The G20's Twenty Agendas,"] ''Council on Foreign Relations'' (US). June 24, 2010, retrieved 2011-04-06</ref> The prime focus of the summit discussions was the recovery from the ongoing [[Late-2000s recession|global recession]] and the [[2010 European sovereign debt crisis|European debt crisis]]. Summit leaders were divided over which strategies would be best for tackling these problems. The [[European Union]] emphasized the need to cut their deficits by focusing on [[austerity]] measures.  In contrast, the [[United States]] emphasized the importance of maintaining [[economic stimulus]] spending in order to encourage growth.<ref>[http://english.aljazeera.net/news/2010/06/2010627114252622620.html "Recession recovery tops G20 agenda,"] ''Al Jazeera'' (Qatar). June 28, 2010, retrieved 2011-04-06</ref> In summit discussions, the countries of the European Union explained projected reductions in spending and balanced budgets.  A different approach was projected by the [[People's Republic of China|China]], India, and the United States, arguing in favor of increased stimulus funding to mitigate the effects of recession. Among the specifics proposed by the European Union were a global [[bank tax]] and a [[Robin Hood tax]], but these plans were opposed by the United States and [[Canada]].<ref>Davies, Rhodri.

[[File:G-20 Toronto June 2010 (20).jpg|thumb|right|Demonstrators holding signs with slogans against the G-20]]
The Toronto summit was the target of widespread protesting which occurred in [[Downtown Toronto]] during the week of the summit. Early opposition to the G-20 included an incident in [[Ottawa]] where a bank was firebombed by [[anarchism|anarchists]], who claimed they would be present during the G-20 summit in Toronto.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/ottawa/story/2010/05/18/ott-glebe-bank-fire.html |title=RBC firebombed as protest, group claims |publisher=CBC (Canada) |date= May 8, 20108|accessdate=2010-09-28 }}</ref> The perceived security threat caused the [[Integrated Security Unit]] to increase security measures.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/article/812976--ottawa-firebombing-proves-security-need-clement-says |title=Ottawa firebombing proves security need, Clement says |publisher=''Toronto Star'' (Canada) |date= May 21, 2010  |accessdate=2010-09-28 | first=Gail | last=Swainson}}</ref>

== Outcome ==
[[File:Leaders at the 2010 G-20 Toronto summit.jpg|thumb|right|Leaders confer at the [[Metro Toronto Convention Centre]] on June 27]]
Prior to the Toronto summit, it was speculated that it would not see the same outcome as previous summits. This was partially due to most countries' entering recovery mode from the [[Late-2000s recession|global economic recession]] after the past [[List of G-20 summits|G-20 summits]]; thus, the likelihood of new issues being raised was minimal.<ref>[http://opinion.globaltimes.cn/commentary/2010-06/544784_2.html "No high hopes for G20 summit outcome."] ''Global Times'' (PRC).

During the working dinner for G-20 leaders on the evening of June 26, South African president [[Jacob Zuma]] promoted more partnership between the international community and Africa for the development in the continent. "As Africa we bring to the G20 Summit the key message that we must, together as the developing and developed worlds, promote stronger and more effective and equal international partnerships for growth and development," he remarked.<ref>[http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&click_id=6&art_id=nw20100627065853768C239086 "Zuma urges more partnerships at G20 dinner,"] ''Independent'' (South Africa).

''The G-20 Toronto Summit Declaration'', which was released shortly after the summit concluded, stated that "serious challenges remain."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globaltvbc.com/Full+text+Toronto+summit+declaration/3208712/story.html |title=Full text: The G20 Toronto summit declaration |publisher=Globaltvbc.com |date=2010-06-27 |accessdate=2010-09-02}}</ref> According to the document, the challenges include high unemployment rates in various economies and the concurrent existence of the impact of the [[Late-2000s financial crisis|financial crisis]]. The [[International Monetary Fund]], in its post-summit document, indicated that a speedy cut in deficits may substantially slow growth. In a publication titled ''Top Ten Commandments for Fiscal Adjustment in Advanced Economies'', the organization insisted that balanced public spending could stabilize [[bond market]]s, reduce interest rates from less government spending, and encourage private investment. It also recommended that emerging economies such as [[China]], which has largely benefited from trade surpluses, rely less on developed nations and increase their own spending in order to promote domestic demand.<ref>{{cite news|author=Post Store |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/06/27/AR2010062702887.html |title=G-20 Toronto Summit Declaration |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date=2010-06-27 |accessdate=2010-09-02}}</ref>

==Criticism==
===Financial costs===
The financial costs of hosting the [[36th G8 summit|G8]] and G-20 summits was the topic of several political debates and the target of criticism by local groups.<ref>Rider, David.

February 22, 2010, retrieved 2011-04-10</ref> The reasons for the large price for both summits were questioned by a few politicians and local groups. Members of Parliament [[Olivia Chow]] and [[Mark Holland]] labelled the initially claimed budget of $1.1-billion for hosting the summits as "obscene" and "insane" while others argued that the money could have been used for long-pending municipal projects in Canada,<ref name="security">[http://www.ctv.ca/CTVNews/Canada/20100528/g8-g20-costs-page-100528/?s_name=&no_ads= "Security chief defends high cost of G8-G20 summits,"] CTV (Canada).

May 26, 2010, retrieved 2011-00004-10</ref> However, according to final calculations from the [[House of Commons of Canada]] as of October 2010, the exact cost for holding both summits was $857,901,850.31,<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/canada/toronto/story/2010/11/05/g20-costs-tabled.html "G8/G20 costs top $857M,"] CBC/Radio-Canada (Canada).

It was initially claimed that the summits stand as the most expensive ever held, with security costs for the [[2009 G-20 London Summit|London]] and [[2009 G-20 Pittsburgh summit|Pittsburgh]] G-20 summits in 2009 reported as having been only {{Nowrap|$30 million}} and {{Nowrap|$18 million}}, respectively.<ref name="security"/>  However, the Canadian [[Parliamentary Budget Officer]], [[Kevin Page]], stated in his official report on the costs of the Huntsville and Toronto gatherings that other countries had not been as open about the full price for the similar meetings held there and that the {{Nowrap|$18 million}} figure for the Pittsburgh summit was merely for overtime pay for local police and the cost of law enforcement brought in from other regions.<ref>Tibbetts, Jane.

June 24, 2010.</ref>  [[Ward Elcock]], former [[Canadian Security Intelligence Service]] director and the chief of the [[Integrated Security Unit]]s for the Winter Olympics and the G8/G-20 summits, claimed that the security costs were in fact "comparable" with those of previous summits.<ref name="security"/> Finance minister [[Jim Flaherty]] defended the security cost, claiming "it's necessary to spend substantially to have security.

===Economic impact===
The summit's economic impact was a major concern of a few local politicians and citizens. The [[municipal government of Toronto]], as well as some public representatives, previously argued that the G-20 summit should be held at an isolated venue, such as the [[Exhibition Place]], rather than the [[Metro Toronto Convention Centre]], which is located in the city's [[central business district]].<ref>"G8, G20 security costs will surpass Olympics, officials say," ''Ottawa Citizen'' (Canada). February 23, 2010.</ref> As a result, during the aftermath of [[#Protests|the protests during the summit]], when several business and properties in [[Downtown Toronto]] were damaged, mayor [[David Miller (Canadian politician)|David Miller]] urged the federal government to compensate for all the damages. It was initially outlined by the government that only damages to businesses within the security zone would be compensated. However, all damages occurred outside of the security zone. Some businesses in the downtown core suffered financially as a result.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://toronto.ctv.ca/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20100629/toronto-riot-compensation-businesses-100629/20100629/?hub=TorontoNewHome |title=Advocates want compensation for T.O. businesses |publisher=CTV (Toronto) |date= June 26, 2010|accessdate=2010-09-28}}</ref> According to Member of Parliament [[John McCallum]], "Stephen Harper made a huge mistake in holding this summit in downtown Toronto." According to the ''[[Toronto Star]]'', at least 40 stores in the [[Downtown Yonge|Downtown Yonge Business Improvement Area]] suffered damages and one repair firm performed up to {{nowrap|$750,000}} in repairs.<ref>Ridder, David and Susan Delacourt. {{cite news|url=http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/article/829912--pressure-builds-on-ottawa-for-compensation?bn=1 |title=Pressure builds on Ottawa for compensation |publisher=''Toronto Star'' (Canada) |date= June 29, 2010 |accessdate=2010-09-28 | first1=David | last1=Rider | first2=Susan | last2=Delacourt}}</ref>

===International response===
On June 17, the [[United States Department of State]] issued a travel alert for Toronto, warning tourists of the expected traffic disruptions and potentially violent protests during the G-20 summit. The alert, which was expected to expire on the last day of the summit, stated that "Even demonstrations that are meant to be peaceful can become violent and unpredictable."<ref>McLean, Jesse. [http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/torontog20summit/article/824844--u-s-issues-g20-travel-alert-for-toronto?bn=1 "U.S. issues G20 travel alert for Toronto,"] ''Toronto Star'' (Canada).

During the midst of Toronto summit, a few overseas reporters commented on Canada and the summits. A reporter of the [[BBC|British Broadcasting Corporation]] (BBC) made positive remarks about Canada's economy, saying "The Canadians, it seems, have answers for even the toughest puzzles and they are keen to share their strategies with the rest of the world. Why in this economy, we all want to be Canadian." A writer in ''[[The New York Times]]'' made positive comments about the summits' preparations and natural beauty of the [[District Municipality of Muskoka|Muskoka]] region. ''[[The Times of India]]'' and ''[[The Hindu]]'' commented on impacts on city life in Toronto due to the G-20 summit and the "unprecedented" security measures taken in Canada. A [[Reuters]] reporter, on the other hand, condemned the international media centre's artificial lake.<ref>[http://www.cp24.com/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20100626/100626_cost_g20/20100626/?hub=CP24Home  "World media buzzing about cost of G20 security and fake lake,"] Canadian Press (Canada).
