'''Route 54''' is a [[state highway]] located in [[Atlantic County, New Jersey|Atlantic County]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[New Jersey]]. It is a southern extension of [[U.S. Route 206]] (US 206), running {{convert|11.86|mi|km|2|abbr=on}} from an intersection with US 206 and [[U.S. Route 30 in New Jersey|US 30]] in [[Hammonton, New Jersey|Hammonton]] to an intersection with [[U.S. Route 40 in New Jersey|US 40]] in [[Buena Vista Township, New Jersey|Buena Vista Township]]. The road passes through the center of Hammonton before running into rural areas. It intersects [[U.S. Route 322 in New Jersey|US 322]] and [[New Jersey Route 73|Route 73]] in [[Folsom, New Jersey|Folsom]] and the [[Atlantic City Expressway]] in Hammonton. What is now Route 54 was originally legislated in 1938 to run from US 30/US 206 in Hammonton south to Main Road in [[Landis Township, New Jersey|Landis Township]] (part of present-day [[Vineland, New Jersey|Vineland]]). The only part taken over as a state highway and designated Route 54 was north of US 40 in Buena, the proposed route south of this point remained as county-maintained Lincoln Avenue. In 1953, Route 54 was defined onto its current alignment. A [[freeway]] was proposed along the Route 54 corridor in the late 1960s to connect the southern terminus of US 206 in Hammonton to [[New Jersey Route 55|Route 55]] in the Vineland/[[Millville, New Jersey|Millville]] area; it was eventually cancelled.

==Route description==
Route 54 begins at an intersection with [[U.S. Route 40 in New Jersey|US 40]]/[[County Route 557 (New Jersey)|CR 557]] and  CR 619 on the border of [[Buena, New Jersey|Buena]] and [[Buena Vista Township, New Jersey|Buena Vista Twp]].<ref name=SLD/> Known as Buena Hammonton Road, it proceeds north-northeast as a two-lane undivided road through agricultural areas with some woods and development, forming the border between Buena to the west and Buena Vista Township to the east.<ref name=SLD/><ref name=gm>{{google maps |url=http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&q=from:+Blue%20Anchor%20Rd/RT-54%20@39.514240,%20-74.924680+to:+Bellevue%20Ave/RT-54%20@39.647626,%20-74.789552 |title=overview of New Jersey Route 54 |accessdate=2008-02-17}}</ref> After fully entering Buena Vista Township and becoming 12th Street, the road reaches an intersection with CR 690 and makes a turn more to the northeast.<ref name=SLD/> At this point, Route 54 enters forested areas, with a few breaks for residences.<ref name=gm/> Upon entering [[Folsom, New Jersey|Folsom]], the route passes over a [[Conrail Shared Assets Operations]] railroad line before coming to a [[cloverleaf interchange]] with [[U.S. Route 322 in New Jersey|US 322]].<ref name=SLD/> After this interchange, the road passes through more residential woodland as it comes to a crossroads with [[New Jersey Route 73|Route 73]], which is signed as County Route 561 Spur. Following this intersection, Route 54 heads through a mix of woods and farm fields as it enters [[Hammonton, New Jersey|Hammonton]] and reaches an interchange with the [[Atlantic City Expressway]].<ref name=SLD/><ref name=gm/> In the area of this interchange, the route is a four-lane [[divided highway]].<ref name=SLD/>

Past the Atlantic City Expressway, the two-lane undivided road continues past homes and farmland as it comes to an intersection with [[County Route 559 (New Jersey)|CR 559]].<ref name=SLD/><ref name=gm/> From this point, Route 54 is lined with residences and businesses as it comes into downtown Hammonton.<ref name=gm/> The road crosses [[New Jersey Transit]]<U+2019>s [[Atlantic City Line]] immediately before a junction with [[County Route 561 (New Jersey)|CR 561]].  After CR 561, the route becomes Bellevue Avenue and encounters the western terminus of [[County Route 542 (New Jersey)|CR 542]].<ref name=SLD/> As the road leaves the downtown area, the surroundings become more residential.<ref name=gm/> Route 54 ends at an intersection with [[U.S. Route 30 in New Jersey|U.S. Route 30]] and ends at [[U.S. Route 30 in New Jersey|US 30]] and [[U.S. Route 206|US 206]], where the road continues north as US 206.<ref name=SLD/>
