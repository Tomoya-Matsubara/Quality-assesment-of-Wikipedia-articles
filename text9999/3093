{{Audio|Amon Leopold Goeth.ogg|'''Amon Leopold Goeth'''}} (represented in German as G<U+00F6>th {{IPA-de|<U+02C8><U+0261><U+00F8><U+02D0>t|pron}}) (11 December 1908&nbsp;<U+2013> 13 September 1946) was an  [[Schutzstaffel|SS]]-''[[Hauptsturmf<U+00FC>hrer]]'' (captain) and the commandant of the [[Krak<U+00F3>w-P<U+0142>asz<U+00F3>w concentration camp]] in [[P<U+0142>asz<U+00F3>w]] in [[General Government|German-occupied Poland]] during World War II. He was tried as a [[war criminal]] after the war by the [[Supreme National Tribunal of Poland]] at Krak<U+00F3>w and was found guilty of personally ordering the imprisonment, torture, and extermination of individuals and groups of people. He was also convicted of homicide, the first such conviction at a war crimes trial, for "personally killing, maiming and torturing a substantial, albeit unidentified number of people".{{sfn|Rzepli<U+00F1>ski|2004|p=2}} He was executed by hanging not far from the former site of the P<U+0142>asz<U+00F3>w camp. The film ''[[Schindler's List]]'' depicts his practice of shooting camp internees.

==Early life and career==
Goeth was born on 11 December 1908 in [[Vienna]], then the capital of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], to a family in the book publishing industry.{{sfn|Crowe|2004|p=217}} Goeth joined a Nazi youth group at age 17 and was a member of the [[antisemitic]] nationalist paramilitary group ''[[Heimwehr]]'' (Home Guard) from 1927 to 1930. He dropped his membership to join the Austrian branch of the [[Nazi Party]], being assigned the party membership number 510,764 in September 1930. Goeth joined the [[Austrian SS]] in 1930 and was appointed an [[Mann (military rank)|SS-''Mann'']] with the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] number 43,673.{{sfn|Crowe|2004|p=218<U+2013>220}}

Goeth served with the SS ''Truppe'' Deimel and ''Sturm'' Libardi in Vienna until January 1933, when he was promoted to serve as adjutant and platoon leader of the 52nd SS ''Standarte'', a regimental-sized unit. He was soon promoted to SS-''[[Scharf<U+00FC>hrer]]'' (squad leader).{{sfn|Crowe|2004|p=220}} He fled to Germany when his illegal activities, including obtaining explosives for the Nazi Party, made him a wanted man. The Austrian Nazi Party was declared illegal in Austria on 19 June 1933, so they set up operations in exile in Munich. From this base, Goeth smuggled radios and weapons into Austria and acted as a courier for the SS. {{sfn|Crowe|2004|pp=220<U+2013>221}} He was arrested in October 1933 by the Austrian authorities and was released for lack of evidence in December 1933. He was again detained after the assassination of Austrian Chancellor [[Engelbert Dollfuss]] in a failed Nazi coup attempt in July 1934. He escaped custody and fled to the SS training facility at [[Dachau]], next to the infamous [[Dachau Concentration Camp]].{{sfn|Crowe|2004|pp=220<U+2013>221}} He temporarily quit the Nazi Party until 1937 and returned home to help his parents with their publishing house. He married on the recommendation of his parents, but was divorced after only a few months.{{sfn|Crowe|2004|pp=221<U+2013>223}}

Goeth returned to Vienna shortly after the [[Anschluss]] in 1938 and resumed his party activities. He married Anny Geiger in a civil SS ceremony on October 1938. The couple had two boys (Werner and Inge) who were born in 1939 and 1940, and a daughter who did not survive childhood. The couple maintained a permanent home in Vienna throughout World War II.{{sfn|Crowe|2004|p=210, 223}} Initially assigned to SS-''Standarte'' 89, Goeth was transferred to SS-''Sturmbann'' 1/11 at the start of the war and was promoted to SS-''[[Oberscharf<U+00FC>hrer]]'' (staff sergeant) in early 1941. He soon gained a reputation as a seasoned administrator in the Nazi efforts to isolate and relocate the Jewish population of Europe as an ''Einsatzf<U+00FC>hrer'' (action leader) and financial officer for the ''Reichskommissariat f<U+00FC>r die Festigung deutschen Volkstums'' (''[[Reichskommissariat]]'' for the Strengthening of German Nationhood; [[Hauptamt Volksdeutsche Mittelstelle#RKFDV|RKFDV]]). He was commissioned to the rank of SS-''[[Untersturmf<U+00FC>hrer]]'' (second lieutenant) on 14 July 1941.{{sfn|Crowe|2004|pp=224<U+2013>226}}

He was transferred to [[Lublin]] in the summer of 1942, where he joined the staff of SS-''[[Brigadef<U+00FC>hrer]]'' [[Odilo Globo<U+010D>nik]], the [[SS and Police Leader]] of the [[Krak<U+00F3>w]] area, as part of [[Operation Reinhard]], the code name given to the establishment of the three [[extermination camp]]s at [[Be<U+0142><U+017C>ec extermination camp|Be<U+0142><U+017C>ec]], [[Sobibor extermination camp|Sobib<U+00F3>r]], and [[Treblinka extermination camp|Treblinka]]. Nothing is known of his activities in the six months he served with Operation Reinhard; participants were sworn to secrecy. But according to the transcripts of his later trial, Goeth was responsible for rounding up and transporting victims to these camps to be killed. He served in this capacity for six months.{{sfn|Crowe|2004|pp=226<U+2013>227}}

==P<U+0142>asz<U+00F3>w==
Goeth was appointed an SS officer of the ''[[SS-Totenkopfverb<U+00E4>nde]]'' ("[[Totenkopf|Deaths-head]]" unit; concentration camp service), and on 11 February 1943 was assigned to construct and command the [[Krak<U+00F3>w-P<U+0142>asz<U+00F3>w concentration camp]].{{sfn|Crowe|2004|p=227}} The camp took one month to construct using forced labour. On 13 March 1943, the Jewish [[Krak<U+00F3>w Ghetto|ghetto of Krak<U+00F3>w]] was liquidated and those still fit for work were sent to the new camp at P<U+0142>asz<U+00F3>w.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=376}} Several thousand not deemed fit for work were sent to extermination camps and killed. Hundreds more were killed on the streets by the Nazis as they cleared out the ghetto.{{sfn|Roberts|1996|pp=60<U+2013>61}}

On 3 September 1943, in addition to his duties at P<U+0142>asz<U+00F3>w, Goeth was assigned to shut down the ghetto at [[Tarn<U+00F3>w]], home to 25,000 Jews (about 45 per cent of the city's population) at the start of World War II. By the time the ghetto was liquidated, 8,000 Jews remained. They were loaded on a train to [[Auschwitz concentration camp]], but less than half survived the journey. Most of the survivors were deemed unsuitable for forced labour and were killed immediately on their arrival at Auschwitz. According to testimony of several witnesses as recorded in his 1946 indictment for war crimes, Goeth personally shot between 30 and 90 women and children during the liquidation of the ghetto.{{sfn|Crowe|2004|p=232}}

Goeth was next ordered to close down the [[Szebnie concentration camp]], which housed 4,000 Jewish and 1,500 Polish slave labourers. Evidence presented at Goeth's trial indicates he delegated the liquidation of the Szebnie ghetto to a subordinate, SS-''[[Hauptscharf<U+00FC>hrer]]'' Josef Grzimek. Between 21 September 1943 and 3 February 1944 the camp was gradually liquidated. Around a thousand of the victims were taken to the nearby forest and shot, and the remainder were sent to Auschwitz, where most were gassed immediately on arrival.{{sfn|Crowe|2004|pp=234<U+2013>236}}

By April 1944, Goeth had been promoted to the rank of SS-''[[Hauptsturmf<U+00FC>hrer]]'' (captain), having received a double promotion, skipping the rank of SS-''[[Obersturmf<U+00FC>hrer]]'' (first lieutenant).{{sfn|Crowe|2004|p=233}} He was also appointed a reserve officer of the [[Waffen-SS]], a branch of the SS.{{sfn|SS service record}} In early 1944 the status of the Krak<U+00F3>w-P<U+0142>asz<U+00F3>w Labour Camp changed to a permanent concentration camp under the direct authority of the ''[[SS-Wirtschafts-Verwaltungshauptamt]]'' (WVHA; SS Economics and Administration Office).{{sfn|Crowe|2004|p=256}} [[Mietek Pemper]]{{efn|[[Mietek Pemper|Mieczys<U+0142>aw "Mietek" Pemper]], who was Jewish, was forced to work as Goeth's personal secretary and stenographer in P<U+0142>asz<U+00F3>w. Using names provided by [[Jewish Ghetto Police]] officer Marcel Goldberg, Pemper compiled and typed [[List of Schindlerjuden|the list of 1,200 Jews]] whose lives were saved when they were sent to Schindler's factory in [[Br<U+00FC>nnlitz]] in October 1944.{{sfn|Mietek Pemper obituary}} }} testified at the trial that it was during the earlier period that Goeth committed most of the random and brutal killings for which he became notorious.{{sfn|Crowe|2004|p=242}}  Concentration camps were more closely monitored by the SS than labour camps, so conditions improved slightly when the designation was changed.{{sfn|Crowe|2004|p=317}}

The camp housed about 2,000 inmates when it opened. At its peak of operations in 1944, a staff of 636 guards oversaw 25,000 permanent inmates, and an additional 150,000 people passed through the camp in its role as a transit camp.{{sfn|Crowe|2004|p=237, 242}} Goeth personally murdered prisoners on a daily basis. His two dogs, Rolf and Ralf, were trained to tear inmates to death.{{sfn|Crowe|2004|p=256}} He shot people from his window if they appeared to be moving too slowly or resting in the yard.{{sfn|Crowe|2004|p=256}} He shot to death a Jewish cook because the soup was too hot.{{sfn|Crowe|2004|p=257}} He brutally mistreated his two maids, [[Helen Jonas-Rosenzweig]] and Helen Hirsch, who were in constant daily fear for their lives, as were all the inmates.{{sfn|Crowe|2004|pp=259<U+2013>264}}

{{quote|As a survivor I can tell you that we are all traumatized people. Never would I, never, believe that any human being would be capable of such horror, of such atrocities. When we saw him from a distance, everybody was hiding, in latrines, wherever they could hide. I can't tell you how people feared him.|Helen Jonas-Rosenzweig{{sfn|Fishman|2009}} }}

[[Poldek Pfefferberg]], another ''[[Schindlerjuden|Schindlerjude]]'' (Schindler Jew), said: "When you saw Goeth, you saw death."{{sfn|Keneally|1993|p=360}} Yet Goeth spared the life of Jewish prisoner Natalia Hubler (later known as [[Natalia Karp]]) and that of her sister, after hearing her play a [[Nocturne in C-sharp minor, Op. posth. (Chopin)|nocturne]] by [[Chopin]] on the piano the day after she arrived at the P<U+0142>asz<U+00F3>w camp.{{sfn|Natalia Karp obituary}}

Goeth believed if one member of a work team escaped or committed some infraction, the entire team must be punished. On one occasion he ordered every second member of a work detail should be shot because one of the party had escaped.{{sfn|Crowe|2004|p=258}} On another occasion he personally shot every fifth member of a crew because one had not returned to the camp.{{sfn|Crowe|2004|p=259}} The main execution site at P<U+0142>asz<U+00F3>w was [[Hujowa G<U+00F3>rka]] ("Prick Hill"), a large hill that was used for mass killings and executions.{{sfn|Crowe|2004|p=265}}  Pemper testified that 8,000 to 12,000 people were murdered at P<U+0142>asz<U+00F3>w.{{sfn|Crowe|2004|p=237}}

==Dismissal and capture==
On 13 September 1944 Goeth was relieved of his position and charged by the SS with charged with theft of Jewish property (which belonged to the state, according to Nazi legislation), failure to provide adequate food to the prisoners under his charge, violation of concentration camp regulations regarding the treatment and punishment of prisoners, and allowing unauthorised access to camp personnel records by prisoners and non-commissioned officers.{{sfn|Crowe|2004|pp=354<U+2013>355}} Administration of the camp at P<U+0142>asz<U+00F3>w was turned over to SS-''[[Obersturmf<U+00FC>hrer]]'' Arnold B<U+00FC>scher. Goeth was scheduled for an appearance before [[SS and Police Court|SS judge]] [[Georg Konrad Morgen]], but due to the progress of World War II and Germany's looming defeat, the charges against him were dropped in early 1945.{{sfn|Crowe|2004|p=359}} SS doctors diagnosed Goeth as suffering from mental illness and he was committed to a mental institution, where he was arrested by the [[United States military]] in May 1945.{{sfn|McKale|2012|p=201}}

==Execution==
[[File:Amon goeth 1946.jpg|thumb|upright|Amon Goeth in 1946, shortly before his execution]]
After the war, the [[Supreme National Tribunal of Poland]] in [[Krak<U+00F3>w]] held his trial between 27 August and 5 September 1946.{{sfn|Rzepli<U+00F1>ski|2004|p=2}} Goeth was found guilty of membership in the Nazi Party (which had been declared a criminal organisation) and personally ordering the imprisonment, torture, and extermination of individuals and groups of people.{{sfn|Rzepli<U+00F1>ski|2004|p=2}} He was also convicted of homicide, the first such conviction at a war crimes trial, for "personally killing, maiming and torturing a substantial, albeit unidentified number of people".{{sfn|Rzepli<U+00F1>ski|2004|p=2}} He was sentenced to death  and was hanged on 13 September 1946 at the [[Montelupich Prison]] in Krak<U+00F3>w, not far from the site of the P<U+0142>asz<U+00F3>w camp.{{sfn|Museum of the Polish Army}} The body was cremated and the ashes thrown in the [[Weichsel River]].{{sfn|Crowe|2004|p=211}}

==Family==
In addition to his two marriages, Goeth had a long-term relationship with Ruth Irene Kalder, an actress originally from [[Breslau]]. She first met Goeth in 1942 when she took a job as a secretary at [[Oskar Schindler]]'s enamelware factory. She soon moved in with Goeth, and the two became engaged late in the war. She took Goeth's name shortly after his death.{{sfn|Crowe|2004|p=210}} Goeth's last child was a daughter, Monika Hertwig, whom he had by Kalder. Monika was born on 23 October 1945, ten months before his execution.{{sfn|Jackson|2009}}{{sfn|Tanabe|2008}}

==In popular culture==
Goeth's actions at P<U+0142>asz<U+00F3>w Labor Camp became internationally known through his depiction by British actor [[Ralph Fiennes]] in the 1993 film ''[[Schindler's List]]''. In a subsequent interview, Fiennes recalled: {{quote | People believe that they<U+2019>ve got to do a job, they<U+2019>ve got to take on an ideology, that they<U+2019>ve got a life to lead; they<U+2019>ve got to survive, a job to do, it<U+2019>s every day inch by inch, little compromises, little ways of telling yourself this is how you should lead your life and suddenly then these things can happen. I mean, I could make a judgement myself privately, this is a terrible, evil, horrific man. But the job was to portray the man, the human being. There<U+2019>s a sort of banality, that everydayness, that I think was important. And it was in the screenplay. In fact, one of the first scenes with Oskar Schindler, with Liam Neeson, was a scene where I<U+2019>m saying, 'You don<U+2019>t understand how hard it is, I have to order so many<U+2014>so many meters of barbed wire and so many fencing posts and I have to get so many people from A to B.' And, you know, he<U+2019>s sort of letting off steam about the difficulties of the job.{{sfn|Fiennes|2010}} }}

Fiennes won a [[BAFTA Award for Best Supporting Actor]] for his role and was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]].{{sfn|Freud|2012}} His portrayal ranked 15th on [[American Film Institute]]'s [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Heroes & Villains|list of the top 50 film villains of all time]]. He ranks as the highest non-fiction villain.{{sfn|American Film Institute|2003}} When P<U+0142>asz<U+00F3>w survivor Mila Pfefferberg was introduced to Fiennes on the set of the film, she began to shake uncontrollably, as Fiennes, attired in full SS dress uniform, reminded her of the real Amon Goeth.{{sfn|Corliss|1994}}

In 2002, Goeth's daughter Monika Hertwig published her memoirs under the title ''Ich mu<U+00DF> doch meinen Vater lieben, oder?'' ("But I have to love my father, don't I?"). Hertwig described the subsequent life of her mother, Ruth Kalder Goeth, who unconditionally glorified her fianc<U+00E9> until confronted with his role in [[the Holocaust]]. Ruth committed suicide in 1983, shortly after giving an interview in [[Jon Blair]]'s documentary ''Schindler''.{{sfn|Jackson|2009}} Hertwig's experiences in dealing with her father's crimes are detailed in ''[[Inheritance (2006)|Inheritance]]'', a 2006 documentary directed by [[James Moll]]. Appearing in the documentary is Helen Jonas-Rosenzweig, one of Goeth's former housemaids. The documentary details the meeting of the two women at the P<U+0142>asz<U+00F3>w memorial site in Poland.{{sfn|PBS, ''Inheritance''}} Hertwig had requested the meeting, but Jonas-Rosenzweig was hesitant because her memories of Goeth and the concentration camp were so traumatic. She eventually agreed after Hertwig wrote to her, "We have to do it for the murdered people."{{sfn|Fishman|2009}} Jonas felt touched by this sentiment and agreed to meet her.{{sfn|Fishman|2009}}

In a subsequent interview, Jonas-Rosenzweig recalled:
{{quote | It's hard for me to be with her because she reminds me a lot of, you know&nbsp;... she's tall, she has certain features. And I hated him so. But she is a victim. And I think it's important because she is willing to tell the story in Germany. She told me people don't want to know, they want to go on with their lives. And I think it's very important because there's a lot of children of perpetrators, and I think she's a brave person to go on talking about it, because it's difficult. And I feel for Monika. I am a mother, I have children. And she is affected by the fact that her father was a perpetrator. But my children are also affected by it. And that's why we both came here. The world has to know, to prevent something like this from happening again."{{sfn|Fishman|2009}} }}

Hertwig also appeared in a documentary called ''[[Hitler's Children (2011 film)|Hitler's Children]]'' (2011), directed and produced by [[Chanoch Zeevi]], an Israeli documentary film maker. In the documentary, Hertwig and other close relatives of infamous Nazi leaders describe their feelings, relationships, and memories of their relatives.{{sfn|IDFA|2011}}
