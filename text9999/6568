The '''89th Boat Race''' took place on 24 March 1937.  Held annually, the Boat Race is a [[Rowing (sport)#Side by side|side-by-side rowing]] race between crews from the Universities of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] along the [[River Thames]].  In a race umpired by former Cambridge rower and coach [[Harold Rickett]], Oxford won by three lengths in a time of 22 minutes 39 seconds.  It was their first success since the [[The Boat Race 1923|1923 race]] and ended Cambridge's record streak of 13 wins.  The victory took the overall record in the event to 47<U+2013>41 in Cambridge's favour.

==Background==
[[The Boat Race]] is a [[Rowing (sport)#Side by side|side-by-side rowing]] competition between the [[University of Oxford]] (sometimes referred to as the "Dark Blues")<ref name=blues>{{Cite web | url = http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2003/apr/06/theobserver | work = [[The Observer]] | title = Dark Blues aim to punch above their weight | date = 6 April 2003 | accessdate = 20 August 2014 }}</ref> and the [[University of Cambridge]] (sometimes referred to as the "Light Blues").<ref name=blues/>  The race was first held in 1829, and since 1845 has taken place on the {{convert|4.2|mi|km|adj=on}} [[The Championship Course|Championship Course]] on the [[River Thames]] in southwest London.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/uk/london/10719622/University-Boat-Race-2014-spectators-guide.html | work = [[The Daily Telegraph]] | accessdate = 20 June 2014 | date = 25 March 2014 |title = University Boat Race 2014: spectators' guide | first = Oliver |last =Smith}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url = http://theboatraces.org/the-course | title = The Course| accessdate = 24 July 2014 | publisher = The Boat Race Company Limited}}</ref>  The rivalry is a major point of honour between the two universities; it is followed throughout the United Kingdom and, as of 2014, broadcast worldwide.<ref name=CBC>{{cite news|title=Former Winnipegger in winning Oxford&ndash;Cambridge Boat Race crew|date=6 April 2014|publisher=[[CBC News]] |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/former-winnipegger-in-winning-oxford-cambridge-boat-race-crew-1.2600176|accessdate=20 August 2014}}</ref>  Cambridge went into the race as reigning champions, having won the [[The Boat Race 1936|1936 race]] by five lengths, and led overall with 47 victories to Oxford's 40 (excluding the [[The Boat Race 1877|"dead heat" of 1877]]).  The Light Blues had thirteen consecutive races coming into this year's event.<ref name=results>{{Cite web | url = http://theboatraces.org/results| publisher = The Boat Race Company Limited | title = Boat Race <U+2013> Results| accessdate = 25 August 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url= http://theboatraces.org/classic-moments-the-1877-dead-heat | publisher = The Boat Race Company Limited | title = Classic moments <U+2013> the 1877 dead heat | accessdate =20 August 2014}}</ref>

Cambridge were coached by J. Beresford Jr, J. R. F. Best, F. E. Hellyer (who had rowed for the Light Blues in the [[The Boat Race 1910|1910]] and [[The Boat Race 1911|1911 races]]) and [[Kenneth Payne]] (who rowed for Cambridge in the [[The Boat Race 1932|1932]] and [[The Boat Race 1934|1934 races]], and had coached Oxford in the [[The Boat Race 1935|1935]] and [[The Boat Race 1936|1936 races]]).  Oxford's coaches were P. C. Mallam (a four-time Dark Blue who had rowed in the [[The Boat Race 1921|1921]], [[The Boat Race 1922|1922]], [[The Boat Race 1923|1923]] and [[The Boat Race 1924|1924 races]]), [[Guy Oliver Nickalls]] (who had rowed three times between 1921 and 1923) and William Rathbone (who rowed for Oxford in the [[The Boat Race 1926|1926]] and [[The Boat Race 1927|1927 races]]).<ref>Burnell, pp. 110&ndash;111</ref>  The umpire for the race was former Cambridge rower [[Harold Rickett]] who had rowed for the Light Blues three times, in the [[The Boat Race 1930|1930]], [[The Boat Race 1931|1931]] and [[The Boat Race 1932|1932 races]].<ref>Burnell, pp. 49, 108</ref>  He had also coached them for the [[The Boat Race 1933|1933 race]].<ref>Burnell, p. 111</ref>

The special correspondent for ''[[The Observer]]'' suggested that the race would be the finest for some years, concluding that "a win for Oxford would do much good to English rowing".<ref>{{Cite news | title = Final analysis of the crews | work = [[The Observer]] | date = 21 March 1937 | page = 24}}</ref>

==Crews==
The Oxford crew weighed an average of 12&nbsp;[[Stone (unit)|st]] 13.5&nbsp;[[Pound (mass)|lb]] (82.1&nbsp;kg), {{convert|7.75|lb|kg|1}} per rower more than their opponents.  Cambridge saw three rowers return to the crew with Boat Race experience, including [[McAllister Lonnon]] who was taking part in his third consecutive event.  Oxford's boat contained four former Blues, including David Michael De Rueda Winser who was also making his third appearance in the Boat Race.<ref name=burn75/>  Oxford's number six [[John Sturrock|Jan Sturrock]] won a silver medal at the [[1936 Summer Olympics]] in the Men's coxless fours.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/st/jan-sturrock-1.html | title = Jan Sturrock Bio, Stats, Results| accessdate = 27 March 2015 | publisher = [[Sports Reference]]}}</ref>  His crew-mate [[John Cherry (rower)|John Cherry]], and Cambridge's [[Thomas Cree]], [[Hugh Mason (rower)|Hugh Mason]] and Lonnon all rowed in the Men's eight for Great Britain in the 1936 Games, finishing fourth.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/GBR/summer/1936/ROW/ | title = Great Britain Rowing at the 1936 Berlin Summer Games | publisher = [[Sports Reference]] | accessdate = 27 March 2015}}</ref>  Cambridge's Cree and [[Coxswain (rowing)|cox]] T.

==Race==
[[File:University Boat Race Thames map.svg|right|thumb|[[The Championship Course]] along which the Boat Race is contested]]
Cambridge won the [[coin flipping|toss]] and elected to start from the [[Surrey]] station, handing the [[Middlesex]] side of the river to Oxford.<ref name=burn75/>  In calm weather, umpire Rickett started the race at 11:35&nbsp;a.m.  A false start ensued, with umpire Rickett failing to hear Oxford state that they were not ready to start.<ref name=oxtimes/>  Rickett restarted the race and, [[stroke rate|out-rating]] their opponents, Cambridge were half a length ahead after the first minute.  They held the same advantage by Craven Steps, but a spurt from Oxford's [[stroke (rowing)|stroke]] A. B. Hodgson saw the Dark Blues draw level.  Following some errant steering from Cambridge's cox Hunter, Oxford pulled away to lead by a canvas-length by the time the crews passed the Mile Post.<ref name=wellbeat/>

As they passed the Crab Tree pub, the Cambridge stroke R. J. L. Perfitt put in a spurt which made little difference as Oxford continued to lead by [[Harrods Furniture Depository]].  Steering away from the Light Blues to avoid a collision, Oxford lost their lead as the crews passed under [[Hammersmith Bridge]] level.  Another spurt from Perfitt saw the Light Blues a third of a length up by the Doves pub as the crews headed into Chiswick Reach.  This time it was Oxford's turn to steer clear of a collision, losing most of their lead by Chiswick Steps, but heading over towards the Middlesex shore, they caught the best of the tide.  The Dark Blues passed below [[Barnes Railway Bridge|Barnes Bridge]] three-quarters of a length ahead, and although Cambridge burst to out-rate Oxford by three strokes per minute, they failed to make any impression and Oxford pulled further ahead.<ref name=wellbeat/> 

Oxford won by three lengths in a time of 22 minutes 39 seconds, securing their first victory since the [[The Boat Race 1923|1923 race]].  It was both the slowest winning time and the narrowest margin of victory since 1877.<ref name=results/>  It was declared by former Oxford rower E. P. Evans as being "one of the most exciting races ever seen on the tideway" and "a truly magnificent victory for the Oxford crew".<ref name=wellbeat>{{Cite news | title = Oxford win at last | first = E. P. | last = Evans | work = [[The Manchester Guardian]] | date = 25 March 1937 | page = 4 }}</ref>  The rowing correspondent in ''The Times'' stated that "not since 1921 has there been such a great race".<ref name=oxtimes>{{Cite news | title =  Oxford's victory | work = [[The Times]] | date = 25 March 1937 | page = 5}}</ref>  He went on to suggest "it was one of the greatest races".<ref name=oxtimes/>
