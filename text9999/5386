The '''1920&ndash;21 season''' was the first season in which [[association football|football]] club '''Gillingham F.C.''' competed in [[the Football League]].  [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]] had previously played in Division One of the [[Southern Football League]], but in 1920 the Football League decided to add a third division to its existing set-up and did so by absorbing the entire Southern League Division One to form the new [[Football League Third Division]].

Gillingham had finished bottom of the Southern League Division One the previous season and fared no better in the Football League, finishing bottom of the table after registering only eight wins in 42 matches.

Gillingham had played in the [[Southern Football League]] since its formation in 1894, apart from when the league was suspended due to the [[First World War]], but had achieved minimal success and had finished bottom of Division One in the [[1919-20 in English football|1919&ndash;20]] season.  The club escaped relegation, however, as the clubs in the Southern League's top division were admitted en masse to [[the Football League]] to form the new [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]].  In preparation for the new season the club signed a number of new players, including [[Wally Battiste]] from [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]], [[Tommy Hall (footballer)|Tommy Hall]] from [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], [[Tom Thompson (footballer born 1894)|Tom Thompson]] from [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] and [[Tom Gilbey]] from [[Darlington F.C.|Darlington]].  Only five players who had represented the club in [[non-league football]] went on to make appearances in the Football League: [[Jock Robertson]], [[Jack Branfield]], [[Joseph Griffiths]], [[Donald McCormick (footballer)|Donald McCormick]] and [[Arthur Wood (footballer)|Arthur Wood]]

The club's first ever Football League match was against [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] at [[Priestfield Stadium]] in front of a new club record crowd of approximately 12,000 fans, and ended in a 1&ndash;1 draw, with Tom Gilbey scoring the Gillingham goal.  Four days later the team defeated [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] 2&ndash;1 away from home to register their first victory, and a week later repeated the feat at home, beating the [[Berkshire]] club 1&ndash;0 to give the club a record of two wins, one draw and one defeat from its first four matches.  This was followed, however, by a run of six matches without a win, including a heavy 6&ndash;1 defeat against [[Merthyr Town F.C.|Merthyr Town]].

After beating [[Exeter City F.C.|Exeter City]] in mid-October, Gillingham then played 12 consecutive matches without a win, including an emphatic 5&ndash;2 defeat at home to [[Northampton Town F.C.|Northampton Town]] on Christmas Day.  The winless streak came to an end when a [[George Needham]] goal gave the team a 1&ndash;0 win over [[Bristol Rovers F.C.|Bristol Rovers]] on [[29 January]], but there then followed a sequence of five games in which the team could only manage a goalless draw and four defeats.  The team staged a late rally in April, winning three of their last six matches, but it was not enough to avoid finishing the season bottom of the table.
