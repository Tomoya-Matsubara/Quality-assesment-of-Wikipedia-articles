'''''Do It Again''''' is an [[extended play]] (EP) by Norwegian [[electronic music]] duo [[R<U+00F6>yksopp]] and Swedish recording artist [[Robyn]], released on 23 May 2014 by Dog Triumph. The extended play coincides with R<U+00F6>yksopp and Robyn's joint tour, the R<U+00F6>yksopp & Robyn Do It Again Tour 2014, featuring shows in Europe and North America. Following her [[Body Talk Tour]], Robyn travelled to [[Bergen]], Norway, where she began working on new music with R<U+00F6>yksopp in early 2013, having previously collaborated with the duo on the songs "[[The Girl and the Robot]]" (2009) and "None of Dem" (2010).

The extended play was met with generally positive reviews from music critics, who praised its music as "flawlessly-produced" and "adventurous", while less favourable reviews criticised the production as "dated" and "too clinical". ''Do It Again'' reached number three in Norway and number twenty in the United Kingdom, while becoming the first number-one album on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'}}s [[Dance/Electronic Albums]] chart for both artists. It was preceded by the singles "[[Do It Again (R<U+00F6>yksopp and Robyn song)|Do It Again]]" and "Sayit", the former of which attained moderate success on the charts. The album is nominated for the 2015 [[Grammy Awards]] in the category : [[Best Electronic/Dance Album]] .

| quote = "We didn't have any master plan for what we were doing. Sounding a bit pretentious, this was a free space without any master plan or blueprint for all three of us. We didn't have any plan other than to hang out, be together and make some music. And we kept it very much between the three of us, without including too many people in terms of labels and management and so on. Which gives you a certain freedom and flexibility. So that was the only sort of thing that we had; have fun, let's have no inhibitions, no limitations and do whatever we want to do, and that's why we made a ten-minute track with saxophone."<ref>{{cite web |last=Hasson |first=Thomas |url=http://thequietus.com/articles/15345-robyn-royksopp-do-it-again-interview |title=INTERVIEW: Robyn & R<U+00F6>yksopp |publisher=[[The Quietus]] |date=23 May 2014 |accessdate=15 June 2014}}</ref>|source=<U+2014>Berge on ''Do It Again''}}

Robyn also stated that she wanted to work with the duo "from scratch". "I thought it would be interesting. In the beginning we just decided to make music. No one said, 'We should make music for this album' or 'We should make music for that album.' Then I had this idea where, you know, maybe we can create something ''together''. I had no real wish to start recording an album right away. I'd just gotten off tour. I wanted to just play around and do stuff and collaborate. Secretly in my mind I wanted us to be a band, but I didn't think it seriously. Then we turned into a band.

According to Berge, the three of them were "in a particular place and space in our lives, where things were perhaps a bit bleak.

And value every opinion, and I think that that translated well into the music."<ref name="rs-interview"/> The duo commented that ''Do It Again'' "doesn't sound like R<U+00F6>yksopp featuring Robyn or Robyn produced by R<U+00F6>yksopp, it's just something else entirely.
