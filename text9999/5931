The '''Thoroughbred''' is a [[list of horse breeds|horse breed]] best known for its use in  [[Thoroughbred horse race|horse racing]].  Although the word "thoroughbred" is sometimes used to refer to any breed of [[purebred]] horse, it technically refers only to the Thoroughbred breed.  Thoroughbreds are considered a "[[Horse#.22Hot.22_bloods|hot-blooded]]" horse, known for their agility, speed and spirit. 

The Thoroughbred as it is known today was first developed in 17th  and 18th century [[England]], when native [[Mare (horse)|mare]]s were [[crossbred]] with imported [[Arabian horse|Arabian]] [[stallion (horse)|stallions]]. All modern Thoroughbreds can trace their pedigrees to three stallions originally imported into England in the 1600s and 1700s, and to 74 [[foundation bloodstock|foundation]] mares of English and Oriental (Arabian or [[Barb (horse)|Barb]]) blood.  During the 1700s and 1800s, the Thoroughbred breed spread throughout the world; they were imported into [[North America]] starting in 1730 and into [[Australia]], [[Europe]], [[Japan]] and [[South America]] during the 1800s. Millions of Thoroughbreds exist worldwide today, with over 118,000&nbsp;[[foal]]s registered each year worldwide.

Thoroughbreds are used mainly for racing, but are also bred for other riding disciplines, such as [[show jumping]], [[combined training]], [[dressage]], [[polo]], and [[fox hunting]]. They are also commonly [[Cross-breeding|cross-bred]] with other breeds to create new breeds or to improve existing ones, and have been influential in the creation of many important breeds, such as the [[Quarter Horse]], the [[Standardbred]], the [[Anglo-Arabian]], and various [[Warmblood]] breeds. 

Thoroughbred racehorses perform with maximum exertion, which has resulted in high rates of accidents and other health problems.  Racing has been proven to have a higher fatality rate than all other legal human and animal [[sport]]s. Also, Thoroughbreds are prone to other health complications, including bleeding from the lungs, low [[fertility]], abnormally small hearts and a small hoof to body mass ratio.  There are several theories for the reasons behind the prevalence of accidents and health problems in the Thoroughbred breed, and research continues into how to reduce the accident rate and treat those animals that are injured.

==Terminology==
The Thoroughbred is a distinct breed of horse, though people sometimes refer to a [[purebred]] horse of any breed as a "thoroughbred". The term for any horse or other animal that is derived from a single [[breed]] line is "[[purebred]]".<ref name="Merriam-Webster">{{cite web |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=2yJusP0vrdgC&pg=RA3-PA905&lpg=RA3-PA905&dq=purebred+of+thoroughbred&source=web&ots=nXyQjlv408&sig=ReocOrbnIwJ8ZyJV-z9rivrLD5U |title=Thoroughbred entry |accessdate=2008-02-17 |author=Merriam-Webster |date=1994 |work= Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of English Usage |publisher=Merriam Webster |pages=p. 195}}</ref><ref name=MW905>Merriam-Webster ''The Merriam-Webster Dictionary of English Usage'' p. 905</ref>  While the term probably came into general use because the English Thoroughbred's [[General Stud Book]] was one of the first [[breed registry|breed registries]] created, in modern usage, horse breeders consider it incorrect to refer to any horse or other animal as a "thoroughbred" except for horses belonging to the Thoroughbred breed.<ref name="Merriam-Webster"/>  Nonetheless, breeders of other species of purebred animals may use the two terms interchangeably,<ref name=MW905/> though the term "thoroughbred" is not used as often for describing purebred animals of other species.<ref name="Merriam-Webster"/><ref name=MW905/>  The term is a [[proper noun]] referring to this specific breed,<ref name="IMH"/> although it is often not capitalized, especially in non-specialist publications, and outside the US; for example, the Australian Stud Book,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.studbook.org.au/AboutTheASB.aspx |title=About the Australian Stud Book |accessdate=2008-06-07 |author=Australian Jockey Club |work=Australian Stub Book Website |publisher= Australian Jockey Club}}</ref> the [[New York Times]],<ref>{{cite web |url= http://query.nytimes.com/search/query?query=thoroughbred&srchst=nyt |title=Search of the New York Times Website for Thoroughbred |accessdate=2008-06-07 |author=New York Times |work=New York Times Website |publisher=New York Times}}</ref> and the [[BBC]] do not capitalize the word.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://search.bbc.co.uk/cgi-bin/search/results.pl?go=homepage&scope=all&tab=all&q=thoroughbred&Search=Search |title= Search of the BBC Website for Thoroughbred |accessdate=2008-06-07 |author=BBC |work=BBC Website |publisher=BBC}}</ref>

==Breed characteristics==
[[Image:ABU-TheRock-2.jpg|thumb|left|Thoroughbreds have a well-chiseled head.]]

==History==
[[Image:Darley Arabian.jpg|thumb|The Darley Arabian, one of the three traditional [[foundation bloodstock|foundation sires]] of the Thoroughbred]]

===Beginnings in England===
====Early racing====
[[Flat racing]] existed in England by at least 1174, when four mile races took place at [[Smithfield]], near [[London]]. Racing continued at fairs and markets throughout the [[Middle Ages]] and into the reign of King [[James I of England]]. It was then that [[handicapping]], a system of adding weight to attempt to equalize a horse's chances of winning as well as improved training procedures, began to be used.  During the reigns of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], Queen [[Anne of England]], King [[William III of England|William III]], and King [[George I of England|George I]]  the foundation of the Thoroughbred was laid.  Under James' grandson, Charles II, a keen racegoer and owner, and James' great-granddaughter Queen Anne, royal support was given to racing and the breeding of race horses.  With royal support, horse racing became popular with the public, and by 1727, a newspaper devoted to racing, the ''Racing Calendar'', was founded.  Devoted exclusively to the sport, it recorded race results and advertised upcoming meets.<ref name=Wall7>Wall ''Famous Running Horses'' pp. 7&ndash;8</ref>

====Foundation stallions====
All modern Thoroughbreds trace back to three stallions imported into [[England]] from the [[Middle East]] in the late 17th and early 18th centuries: the [[Byerly Turk]] (1680s), the [[Darley Arabian]] (1704), and  the [[Godolphin Arabian]] (1729).<ref>Milner ''The Godolphin Arabian'' pp. 3&ndash;6</ref><ref>Wall ''Famous Running Horses'' p. 8</ref>  Other stallions of oriental breeding were less influential, but still made noteworthy contributions to the breed. These included the Alcock Arabian,<ref name=Willet25>Willett ''The Thoroughbred'' p. 25</ref>  D'Arcy's White Turk, Leedes Arabian, and Curwen's Bay Barb.<ref name=TrackTalk45>Phifer ''Track Talk'' p. 45</ref><ref name=Morris>Morris ''Thoroughbred Stallions'' pp. 1&ndash;2</ref><ref>Articles on the mentioned horses are located at {{cite web |url=http://www.tbheritage.com/HistoricSires/FoundationSires/FSDarcyWhite.html |title= Foundation Sires of the Thoroughbred: D'Arcy's White Turk |accessdate=2008-02-17 |author=Peters, Anne  |work= Foundation Sires of the Thoroughbred |publisher=Thoroughbred Heritage}}, {{cite web |url=http://www.tbheritage.com/HistoricSires/FoundationSires/FoundSiresL.html |title= Foundation Sires of the Thoroughbred: L |accessdate=2008-02-17   |work= Foundation Sires of the Thoroughbred |publisher=Thoroughbred Heritage}}, {{cite web |url=http://www.tbheritage.com/HistoricSires/FoundationSires/FSCurwensBayBarb.html |title= Foundation Sires of the Thoroughbred: Curwen's Bay Barb |author=Peters, Anne |accessdate=2008-02-17   |work= Foundation Sires of the Thoroughbred |publisher=Thoroughbred Heritage}}</ref> Another was the Brownlow Turk, who, among other attributes, is thought to be largely responsible for the [[gray (horse)|gray]] coat color in Thoroughbreds.<ref name=Willet25/>  The addition of Arabian bloodlines to the native English mares ultimately led to the creation of the [[General Stud Book]] (GSB) in 1791 and the practice of official [[breed registry|registration]] of horses.<ref name="IMH">{{cite web |url= http://www.imh.org/museum/breeds.php?pageid=8&breed=94&alpha=Five |title=Thoroughbred |accessdate=2008-02-17  |work= Horse Breeds of the World |publisher=International Museum of the Horse }}</ref>

Each of the three major [[foundation bloodstock|foundation sires]] was, coincidentally, the ancestor of a grandson or great-great-grandson who was the only male descendant to perpetuate each respective horse's male line: [[Matchem]] was the only descendant of his grandsire, the Godolphin Arabian, to maintain a male line to the present;<ref name=Milner140>Milner ''The Godolphin Arabian'' p. 140</ref> the Byerly Turk's male line was preserved by [[Herod (horse)|Herod]] (or King Herod), a great-great-grandson;<ref name=Willett38>Willett ''The Thoroughbred'' pp. 38<U+2013>39</ref> and the male line of the Darley Arabian owes its existence to great-great-grandson [[Eclipse (horse)|Eclipse]], who was the dominant racehorse of his day and never defeated.<ref name=TrackTalk45/><ref name=Willett37>Willett ''The Thoroughbred'' p. 37</ref>  [[Image:Matchem.jpg|thumb|Matchem, a grandson of the Godolphin Arabian, from a painting by [[George Stubbs]]]]  One genetic study indicates that 95% of all male Thoroughbreds trace their direct male line (via the [[Y-chromosome]]) to the Darley Arabian.<ref name="Pickrell">Pickrell [http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn7941 "95% of thoroughbreds linked to one superstud"] ''New Scientist''</ref> However, in modern Thoroughbred pedigrees, most horses have more crosses to the Godolphin Arabian (13.8%) than to the Darley Arabian (6.5%) when all lines of descent (maternal and paternal) are considered.  Further, as a percentage of contributions to current Thoroughbred bloodlines, Curwen's Bay Barb (4.2%) appears more often than the Byerly Turk (3.3%).  The majority of modern Thoroughbreds alive today trace to a total of only 27 or 28 stallions from the 18th and 19th&nbsp;centuries.<ref name="Pickrell"/><ref name="Cunningham">Cunningham [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11736806?dopt=Abstract "Microsatellite diversity"] ''Animal Genetics''</ref><ref name=FullCunningham>Cunningham [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11736806?dopt=Abstract "Microsatellite diversity"] ''Animal Genetics''</ref>

====Foundation mares====
The [[mare (horse)|mares]] used as foundation breeding stock came from a variety of breeds, some of which, such as the [[Irish Hobby]], had developed in northern Europe prior to the 13th&nbsp;century.<ref name="mtDNA3">Erigero [http://www.tbheritage.com/GeneticMarkers/mtdnaintbdamlines3.html "Who's Your Momma III"] ''Animal Genetics''</ref> Other mares were of oriental breeding, including Barb, [[Turkoman horse|Turk]] and other bloodlines.<ref name="mtDNA2">Erigero [http://www.tbheritage.com/GeneticMarkers/mtdnaintbdamlines3.html "Who's Your Momma II"] ''Animal Genetics''</ref>  The 19th&nbsp;century researcher Bruce Lowe identified 50&nbsp;mare "families" in the Thoroughbred breed, later augmented by other researchers to 74.<ref name="mtDNA1">Erigero [http://www.tbheritage.com/GeneticMarkers/mtdnaintbdamlines.html "New Research Sheds Light on Old Pedigrees"] ''Animal Genetics''</ref> However, it is probable that fewer genetically unique mare lines existed than Lowe identified.<ref name="mtDNA1"/> Recent studies of the [[Mitochondrial DNA|mtDNA]] of Thoroughbred mares indicate that some of the mare lines thought to be genetically distinct may actually have had a common ancestor; in 19&nbsp;mare lines studied, the [[haplotype]]s revealed that they traced to only 15&nbsp;unique foundation mares, suggesting either a common ancestor for foundation mares thought to be unrelated or recording errors in the GSB.<ref name="mtDNA1"/>

===Later development in Britain===
By the end of the 18th century, the English [[British Classic Races|Classic races]] had been established. These are the [[St. Leger Stakes]], founded in 1776, the [[Epsom Oaks]], founded in 1779, and the [[Epsom Derby]] in 1780. Later, the [[2,000 Guineas Stakes|2,000&nbsp;Guineas Stakes]] and the [[1,000 Guineas Stakes|1,000&nbsp;Guineas Stakes]] were founded in 1809 and 1814. The 1,000&nbsp;Guineas and the Oaks are restricted to [[filly|fillies]], but the others are open to racehorses of either sex aged three years. The distances of these races, ranging from {{convert|1|mi|km|abbr=on}} to {{convert|1.75|mi|km|abbr=on}}, led to a change in breeding practices, as breeders concentrated on producing horses that could race at a younger age than in the past and that had more speed. In the early 18th&nbsp;century, the emphasis had been on longer races, up to {{convert|4|mi|km|abbr=on}}, that were run in multiple heats. The older style of race favored older horses, but with the change in distances, younger horses became preferred.<ref name=Classic34>Willett ''The Classic Racehorse'' pp. 34<U+2013>36</ref> 

Selective breeding for speed and racing ability led to improvements in the size of horses and winning times by the middle of the 19th&nbsp;century. [[Bay Middleton (horse)|Bay Middleton]], a winner of the Epsom Derby, stood over 16&nbsp;hands high, a full hand higher than the Darley Arabian. Winning times had increased to such a degree that many felt further improvement by adding additional Arabian bloodlines was impossible. This was borne out in 1885, when a race was held between a Thoroughbred, Iambic, considered a mid-grade runner, and the best Arabian of the time, Asil. The race was over {{convert|3|mi|m|abbr=on}}, and although Iambic was [[Handicap race|handicapped]] by carrying  {{convert|4.5|st|kg}} (63&nbsp;lbs) more than Asil, he still managed to beat Asil by 20&nbsp;lengths.<ref name=Classic39>Willett ''The Classic Racehorse'' pp. 39<U+2013>41</ref>  An aspect of the modern British breeding establishment is that they breed not only for flat racing, but also for [[steeplechase|steeplechasing]].<ref name=Classic57>Willett ''The Classic Racehorse'' p. 57</ref>  Up until the end of the 19th century, Thoroughbreds were bred not only for racing but also as saddle horses.<ref name=Derry31>Derry ''Horses in Society'' p. 41</ref>

Soon after the start of the 20th&nbsp;century, fears that the English races would be overrun with American-bred Thoroughbreds because of the closing of US racetracks in the early 1910s, led to the Jersey Act of 1913.<ref name=Classic111>Willett ''The Classic Racehorse'' pp. 111<U+2013>113</ref> It  prohibited the registration of any horse in the General Stud Book (GSB)  if they could not show that every ancestor traced to the GSB. This excluded most American-bred horses, because the 100-year gap between the founding of the GSB and the American Stud Book meant that most American-bred horses possessed at least one or two crosses to horses not registered in the GSB. The act was not repealed until 1949, after which a horse was only required to show that all his ancestors to the ninth generation were registered in a recognized Stud Book.<ref name=Classic71>Willett ''The Classic Racehorse'' pp. 71<U+2013>74</ref> Many felt that the Jersey Act hampered the development of the British Thoroughbred by preventing breeders in the United Kingdom from using new bloodlines developed outside of the British Isles.<ref name=Classic56>Willett ''The Classic Racehorse'' p. 56</ref>

===In America===
The first Thoroughbred horse in the [[American Colonies]] was Bulle Rock, imported in 1730 by Samuel Gist of [[Hanover County, Virginia]].<ref name="Robertson16">Robertson ''History of Thoroughbred Racing in America'' p. 16</ref><ref name="ASB10">Bruce ''The American Stud Book'' Volume 1 p. 10</ref> [[Maryland]] and [[Virginia]] were the centers of Colonial Thoroughbred breeding, along with [[South Carolina]] and [[New York]]. During the [[American Revolution]] importations of horses from England practically stopped but were restarted after the signing of a peace treaty. Two important stallions were imported around the time of the Revolution; [[Messenger (horse)|Messenger]] in 1788 and [[Diomed]] before that. Messenger left little impact on the American Thoroughbred, but is considered a foundation sire of the [[Standardbred]] breed. Diomed, who won the Derby Stakes in 1780, had a significant impact on American Thoroughbred breeding, mainly through his son [[Sir Archy]].<ref name="Montgomery">Montgomery ''The Thoroughbred'' pp. 131<U+2013>136</ref><ref name=DerbyWins>{{cite web |url=http://www.tbheritage.com/TurfHallmarks/racecharts/epderby.html |title= Turf Hallmarks: Epsom Derby Stakes |accessdate=2008-02-17  |work=Turf Hallmarks |publisher=Thoroughbred Heritage}}</ref> John F. Wall, a racing historian, said that Sir Archy was the "first outstanding stallion we can claim as native American."<ref name=Wall114>Wall ''Famous Running Horses'' pp. 114&ndash;115</ref> He retired from the racetrack because of lack of opponents.<ref name=Wall114/>

After the American Revolution, the center of Thoroughbred breeding and racing in the United States moved west.  [[Kentucky]] and [[Tennessee]] became notable centers. [[Andrew Jackson]], later President of the United States, was a breeder and racer of Thoroughbreds in Tennessee.<ref name=Montgomery142>Montgomery ''The Thoroughbred'' pp. 142<U+2013>143</ref> Famous match races held in the early 19th&nbsp;century helped popularize horse racing in the United States. One took place in 1823, in [[Long Island, New York]], between Sir Henry and [[American Eclipse]]. Another was a match race between [[Boston (horse)|Boston]] and [[Fashion (horse)|Fashion]] in 1838 that featured bets of $20,000 from each side.<ref name=Montgomery143>Montgomery ''The Thoroughbred'' pp. 143<U+2013>147</ref> The last major match races before the [[American Civil War]] were both between [[Lexington (horse)|Lexington]] and Lecompte. The first was held in 1854 in [[New Orleans]] and was won by Lecompte. Lexington's owner then challenged Lecompte's owner to a rematch, held in 1855 in New Orleans and won by  Lexington. Both of these horses were sons of Boston, a descendant of Sir Archy.<ref name=Montgomery152>Montgomery ''The Thoroughbred'' pp. 152<U+2013>154</ref> Lexington went on to a career as a breeding stallion, and led the sires list of number of winners for sixteen years, fourteen of them in a row.<ref name=Wall119>Wall ''Famous Running Horses'' p. 119</ref>

After the [[American Civil War]], the emphasis in American racing changed from the older style of four-mile (6&nbsp;km) races in which the horses ran in at least two heats. The new style of racing involved shorter races not run in heats, over distances from five [[furlong]]s up to {{convert|1.5|mi|km}}. This development meant a change in breeding practices, as well as the age that horses were raced, with younger horses and sprinters coming to the fore.  It was also after the Civil War that the American Thoroughbred returned to England to race. [[Iroquois (horse)|Iroquois]] became the first American-bred winner of the Epsom Derby in 1881. The success of American-bred Thoroughbreds in England led to the Jersey Act in 1913, which limited the importation of American Thoroughbreds into England.<ref name=Willett159>Willett ''The Thoroughbred'' pp. 159<U+2013>163</ref> After [[World War I]], the breeders in America continued to emphasize speed and early racing age but also imported horses from England, and this trend continued past World War II.<ref name=Willett165>Willett ''The Thoroughbred'' pp. 165<U+2013>171</ref> After [[World War II]], Thoroughbred breeding remained centered in Kentucky, but [[California]], New York, and [[Florida]] also emerged as important racing and breeding centers.<ref name=Willett175>Willett ''The Thoroughbred'' pp. 175<U+2013>176</ref> 

Thoroughbreds in the United States have historically been used not only for racing but also to improve other breeds. The early import, Messenger, was the foundation of the Standardbred,<ref name=Evans28>Evans ''The Horse'' pp. 28<U+2013>29</ref> and Thoroughbred blood was also instrumental in the development of the [[American Quarter Horse]].<ref name=Evans23>Evans ''The Horse'' pp. 23<U+2013>27</ref> The foundation stallion of the [[Morgan horse|Morgan]] breed is held by some to have been sired by a Thoroughbred.<ref name=Evans36>Evans ''The Horse'' p. 36</ref> Between World War I and World War II, the U.S. Army used Thoroughbred stallions as part of their Remount Service, which was designed to improve the stock of [[cavalry]] mounts.<ref name=Derry137>Derry ''Horses in Society'' pp. 136<U+2013>137</ref><ref name=Fort27>Buecker ''Fort Robinson'' pp. 27<U+2013>29</ref>

===In Europe===
Thoroughbreds began to be imported to [[France]] in 1817 and 1818 with the importation of a number of stallions from England, but initially the sport of horse racing did not prosper in France. The first Jockey Club in France was not formed until 1833, and in 1834 the racing and regulation functions were split off to a new society, the ''Societe d'Encouragement pour l'Amelioration des Races de Chevaux en France'', better known as the [[Jockey-Club de Paris]].<ref name=Willett119>Willett ''The Thoroughbred'' pp. 119<U+2013>122</ref> The ''French Stud Book'' was founded at the same time by the government.<ref name=Classic130>Willett ''The Classic Racehorse'' p. 30</ref>  By 1876, French-bred Thoroughbreds were regularly winning races in England, and in that year a French breeder-owner earned the most money in England on the track.<ref name=Willett127>Willett ''The Thoroughbred'' pp. 125<U+2013>128</ref> World War I almost destroyed French breeding because of war damage and lack of races.<ref name=Willett134>Willett ''The Thoroughbred'' p.134</ref> After the war, the premier French race, the Grand Prix, resumed and continues to this day. During World War II, French Thoroughbred breeding did not suffer as it had during the first World War, and thus was able to compete on an equal footing with other countries after the war.<ref name=Willett139>Willett ''The Thoroughbred'' pp. 139<U+2013>143</ref>

Organized racing in [[Italy]] started in 1837, when race meets were established in Florence and Naples and a meet in Milan was founded in 1842. Modern flat racing came to Rome in 1868. Later importations, including the Derby Stakes winners Ellington (1856) and Melton (1885), came to Italy before the end of the 19th&nbsp;century.<ref name=Willett180>Willett ''The Thoroughbred'' pp. 180&ndash;82</ref><ref name=DerbyWins/> Modern Thoroughbred breeding in Italy is mostly associated with the breeding program of [[Federico Tesio]], who started his breeding program in 1898. Tesio was the breeder of [[Nearco]], one of the dominant sires of Thoroughbreds in the later part of the 20th&nbsp;century.<ref name=Willett182>Willett ''The Thoroughbred'' pp. 182<U+2013>187</ref>

Other countries in Europe have Thoroughbred breeding programs, including [[Germany]],<ref name=Classic162>Willett ''The Classic Racehorse'' pp. 162<U+2013>169</ref> [[Russia]], [[Poland]], and [[Hungary]].<ref name=Classic202>Willett ''The Classic Racehorse'' pp. 202<U+2013>211</ref> However, none of these countries have made a large mark on the breeding of Thoroughbreds.<ref name=Classic162/><ref name=Classic202/>

===In Australia and New Zealand===

===In other areas===
Thoroughbreds have been exported to many other areas of the world since the breed was created.  Oriental horses were imported into [[South Africa]] from the late 1600s in order to improve the local stock through crossbreeding.  Horse racing was established there in the late 1700s and early 1800s, and Thoroughbreds were imported in increasing numbers.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.tbheritage.com/Breeders/SABreeding/SABreeders.html|title= Thoroughbred Horse Racing and Breeding in South Africa|accessdate=2008-02-27 |author=Herringer, Philip |date= 2004|work= Breeders and Breeding|publisher= Thoroughbred Heritage}}</ref>  The first Thoroughbred stallions arrived in [[Argentina]] in 1853, but the first mares did not arrive until 1865.

Unlike a significant number of registered breeds today, a horse cannot be registered as a Thoroughbred (with [[The Jockey Club]] registry) unless conceived by "live cover"; that is, by the witnessed natural mating of a mare and a stallion. [[Artificial insemination]] (AI) and [[embryo transfer]] (ET), though commonly used and allowable in many other horse breed registries, cannot be used with Thoroughbreds.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.jockeyclub.com/registry.asp?section=3#one|title= Rules and Regulations of Thoroughbreds |accessdate=2007-07-04 |publisher= The Jockey Club|work=The Jockey Club Website}}</ref> One reason is that a greater possibility of error exists in assigning parentage with AI, and although DNA and blood testing eliminate many of those concerns, AI still requires more detailed record keeping.<ref name=BreedMan349>Equine Research ''Breeding Management and Foal Development'' p. 349</ref> The main reason, however, may be economic: a stallion has a limited number of mares who can be serviced by live cover. Thus, the practice prevents an oversupply of Thoroughbreds, though modern management still allows a stallion to live cover more mares in a season than once was thought possible. By allowing a stallion to cover only a couple hundred mares a year rather than the couple thousand possible with AI, it also preserves the high prices paid for horses of the finest or most popular lineages.<ref name=HorseInfoFAQ>{{cite web |url= http://www.horseinfo.com/info/faqs/faqbreedingQ2.html |title= Frequently Asked Questions: Breeding |accessdate=2008-02-17 |author= Russell Meerdink Co |work=HorseInfo.com Web Site |publisher= Russell Meerdink Co}} </ref>

Concern exists that the [[closed stud book]] and tightly regulated population of the Thoroughbred is at risk of loss of [[genetic diversity]] because of the level of inadvertent [[inbreeding]] inevitable in such a small population. According to one study, 78% of [[allele]]s in the current population can be traced to 30&nbsp;foundation animals, 27 of which are male. Ten foundation mares account for 72% of maternal (tail-female) lineages, and, as noted above, one stallion appears in 95% of tail male lineages.<ref name="Cunningham"/>  Thoroughbred pedigrees are generally traced through the [[maternal]] line, called the "distaff" line.  The line that a horse comes from will often determine the price paid regardless of the actual talent or potential of the horse.<ref name="Napier">Napier  ''Blood will tell'' pp. 17&ndash;18</ref>

==Value==
Prices on Thoroughbreds vary greatly, depending on age, [[pedigree]], [[equine conformation|conformation]], and other market factors.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://extension.umd.edu/publications/PDFs/FS665.pdf|title= Price Factors and Sales Trends |accessdate=2008-06-05 |work=Maryland Cooperative Extension |format=pdf |author=Commer, Malcom |publisher=University of Maryland }}</ref>  In 2007, [[Keeneland#Keeneland_Sales|Keeneland Sales]], a United States based sales company, sold 9,124 horses at auction, with a total value of $814,401,000, which gives an average price of $89,259.<ref name=Keeneland2007>{{cite web |url=http://ww2.keeneland.com/sales/lists/copy/recap.aspx| title=Yearly Sales Recap |accessdate=2008-06-05 |author= Keeneland Sales  |work=Keeneland Sales Website |publisher=Keeneland Sales}}</ref> As a whole for the United States in 2007, The Jockey Club auction statistics indicate that the average [[weanling]] sold for $44,407, the average yearling sold for $55,300, average sale price for two-year-olds was $61,843, broodmares averaged $70,150, and horses over two and broodmare prospects sold for an average of $53,243.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jockeyclub.com/factbook.asp?section=13 |title=2007 Auction Statistics |accessdate=2008-06-05 |author=The Jockey Club |work=The Jockey Club Factbook |publisher=The Jockey Club}}</ref> For Europe, the July 2007 Tattersall's Sale sold 593 horses at auction, with a total for the sale of 10,951,300 [[Guinea (British coin)|guineas]],<ref>Traditionally, the obselete guinea, <U+00A3>1.05, formerly 21 [[Shilling (United Kingdom)|shillings]], is retained as the unit of account for these sales.</ref> for an average of 18,468 guineas.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tattersalls.com/ |title=Tattersall's (Select Sales & Results, then July) |accessdate=2008-06-05 |author=Tattersalls |work= Tattersall's Website |publisher=Tattersall's }}</ref> Doncaster Bloodstock Sales, another British sales firm, in 2007 sold 2,248 horses for a total value of 43,033,881 guineas, making an average of 15,110 guineas per horse.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dbsauctions.com/news/SalesStatistics.htm |title=Sales Statistics |accessdate=2008-06-05 |author=Doncaster Bloodstock Sales |work= Doncaster Bloodstock Sales Website |publisher= Doncaster Bloodstock Sales}}</ref>

Averages, however, can be deceiving.  For example, at the 2007 Fall Yearling sale at Keeneland, 3,799 young horses sold for a total of $385,018,600, for an average of $101,347 per horse.<ref name=Keeneland2007/> However, that average sales price reflected a variation that included at least 19 horses that sold for only $1,000 each and 34 that sold for over $1,000,000 apiece.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ww2.keeneland.com/sales/lists/sale/results.aspx?SaleId=200802|title=Keeneland September 2007 Yearling Sale Results |accessdate=2008-06-05 |author= Keeneland Sales  |work=Keeneland Sales Website |publisher=Keeneland Sales}}</ref>

The value of a Thoroughbred may be influenced by the purse money it wins.

==Uses==
Although the Thoroughbred is primarily bred for [[Thoroughbred horse racing|racing]], the breed is also used for [[show jumping]] and [[eventing|combined training]] because of its athleticism, and many retired and retrained race horses become fine family riding horses, [[dressage]] horses, and youth show horses.  The larger horses are sought after for hunter/jumper and dressage competitions, whereas the smaller horses are in demand as [[polo]] ponies.

===Horse racing===
[[Image:Horse-racing-4.jpg|right|thumb|Race horses competing on turf (grass racetrack) in Germany.  Most races in Europe are run on turf, while most races in the United States are run on dirt.]]
{{main|Thoroughbred horse race}}

Thoroughbred horses are primarily bred for racing under [[saddle]] at the [[horse gait|gallop]]. Thoroughbreds are often known for being either distance runners or sprinters, and their [[Equine conformation|conformation]] usually reflects what they have been bred to do. Sprinters are usually well muscled, while ''stayers'', or distance runners, tend to be smaller and slimmer.<ref name=TrackTalk26>Phifer ''Track Talk'' p. 26</ref> The size of the horse is one consideration for buyers and trainers when choosing a potential racehorse.  Although there have been famous racehorses of every height, from [[Man o' War (horse)|Man o' War]] and [[Secretariat (horse)|Secretariat]] who both stood at 16.2 hands<ref name=Montgomery183>Montgomery ''The Thoroughbred'' pp. 183<U+2013>186</ref><ref name=Bong112>Bongianni ''Champion Horses'' pp. 112<U+2013>113</ref> to [[Hyperion (horse)|Hyperion]] (15.1),<ref name=Bong56>Bongianni ''Champion Horses'' p. 56</ref> the best racehorses are generally of average size.<ref name="Wagoner">Hedge ''Horse Conformation'' p. 35</ref>  Larger horses mature more slowly and have more stress on their legs and feet, making them more predisposed to lameness.<ref name="Equus">Barakat "Why Size Matters" ''Equus''</ref>  Smaller horses are considered by some to be at a disadvantage due to their shorter stride and a tendency of other horses to bump them, especially in the starting gate.<ref name="Wagoner"/> Historically, Thoroughbreds have steadily increased in size:  the average height of a Thoroughbred in 1700 was about 13.3&nbsp;hands high. By 1876 this had increased to 15.3. The United States champion racer [[Forego]] stood 17&nbsp;hands.<ref name=TrackTalk24>Phifer ''Track Talk'' p. 24</ref>  Statistically, fewer than 50% of all race horses ever win a race, and less than 1% ever win a [[stakes race]] such as the [[Kentucky Derby]] or the [[Epsom Derby]].<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/03_24/b3837115_mz025.htm?chan=search |title=So You Want to Race a Horse |accessdate=2008-06-05 |author=Gutner, Toddi |date=2003-06-16 |work= [[Business Week]]| publisher= Business Week |pages= p. 92}}</ref>

In 2007, there were 71,959 horses who started races in the United States, and the average Thoroughbred racehorse in the United States and Canada ran 6.33 times in that year.<ref name=RacingStats/> In Britain, the British Racing Authority states there were 8,556 horses in training for flat racing for 2007, and those horses started 60,081 times in 5,659 races.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.britishhorseracing.com/images/inside_horseracing/media/BHA_Annual_Review_06-07.pdf |title=British Horseracing Review 2006-2007 |accessdate=2008-06-05 |author=British Horseracing Authority |work=British Horseracing Authority Website |publisher= British Horseracing Authority}}</ref> 

Horses finished with a racing career that are not suitable for breeding purposes often become riding horses or other equine companions. A number of agencies exist to help make the transition from the racetrack to another career, or to help find retirement homes for ex-racehorses.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.bloodhorse.com/TradeZone/pdf/tz_05-10-08.pdf |title= Options for Ex-racehorses |accessdate=2008-06-05 |last= Thomas |first=Heather Smith |date=2008-05-10 |format=pdf |publisher=[[The Blood-Horse magazine|Blood-horse Magazine]]}}</ref>

===Other disciplines===
[[Image:R3DE XCountry.JPG|right|thumb|250px|A Thoroughbred competing in [[eventing]]]]
In addition to racing, Thoroughbreds compete in [[eventing]], [[show jumping]] and [[dressage]] at the highest levels of international competition, including the [[Equestrian at the Summer Olympics|Olympics]].  They are also used as [[show hunter]]s, [[steeplechasing|steeplechasers]], and in [[western riding]] speed events such as [[barrel racing]].  [[Mounted police]] divisions employ them in non-competitive work, and recreational riders also use them.<ref name=JCTBinfo>{{cite web |url= http://www.jockeyclub.com/thoroughbredHistory.asp |title= The Thoroughbred |accessdate=2008-02-17 |author=The Jockey Club  |work= The Jockey Club Web Site |publisher=The Jockey Club}}</ref>  Thoroughbreds are one of the most common breeds for use in [[polo]] in the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.americanpolohorse.com/polohorse.html |title=What is a Polo Pony or Polo Horse? |accessdate= 2008-02-17 |author=American Polo Horse Association staff |work=American Polo Horse Association Web Site |publisher= American Polo Horse Association}}</ref> They are often seen in the [[fox hunting]] field as well.<ref>Jones [http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/1973/6/1973_6_62.shtml "Fox Hunting in America"] ''American Heritage Magazine''</ref>

===Crossbreeding===
Thoroughbreds are often crossed with horses of other breeds to create new breeds or improve existing ones. They have been influential on many modern breeds, including the [[American Quarter Horse]],<ref name=OKStateQH>{{cite web |url= http://www.ansi.okstate.edu/breeds/horses/quarter |title= Quarter Horse |accessdate=2008-02-17 |author=Oklahoma State University Department of Animal Science  |work=Breeds of Livestock |publisher= Oklahoma State University}} </ref> the [[Standardbred]],<ref name=OKStateStandardbred>{{cite web |url= http://www.ansi.okstate.edu/breeds/horses/standardbred/index.htm |title= Standardbred |accessdate=2008-02-17 |author=Oklahoma State University Department of Animal Science  |work=Breeds of Livestock |publisher= Oklahoma State University}}</ref> and possibly the [[Morgan horse|Morgan]], a breed that went on to influence many of the [[ambling|gaited]] breeds in North America.<ref name=MorganMus>{{cite web |url= http://www.morganmuseum.org/html/amhistory.html |title= Morgan Horses in American History |accessdate=2008-02-17 |author= Curler, Elizabeth |work= The National Museum of the Morgan Horse Web Site |publisher= The National Museum of the Morgan Horse}}</ref>  Other common crosses with the Thoroughbred include crossbreeding with Arabian bloodlines to produce the  [[Anglo-Arabian]]<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.arabianhorses.org/registration/hareg/reg_haquick_facts.asp|title= Quick Facts|accessdate=2008-02-27 |work= Half-Arabian and Anglo-Arabian Registration|publisher= Arabian Horse Association}}</ref> as well as with the [[Irish Draught]] to produce the [[Irish Sport Horse]].<ref name=ISH>{{cite web |url= http://www.irishdraught.com/aboutsh |title= The Irish Draught Sport Horse |accessdate=2008-02-17 |author= Irish Draught Horse Society  |work= Irish Draught Horse Society Web Site |publisher= Irish Draught Horse Society}}</ref>  Thoroughbreds are often crossed with various [[Warmblood]] breeds due to their refinement and performance capabilities.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.americantrakehner.com/The%20Breed/TBInfluence.htm|title= The Trakehner Breed and the Thoroughbred|accessdate=2008-02-27 |author= Von Velsen, Dr. Eberhard|date= September/October 1981|work= Trakehner Hefte|publisher= American Trakehner Association}}</ref>

==Health issues==
Although Thoroughbreds are seen in the hunter-jumper world and in other disciplines, modern Thoroughbreds are primarily bred for speed, and racehorses have a very high rate of accidents as well as other health problems. 

One tenth of all Thoroughbreds suffer orthopedic problems, including fractures.<ref name="Pickrell"/> Current estimates indicate that there are 1.5 career-ending breakdowns for every 1,000 horses starting a race in the United States, an average of two horses per day.  The State of California reported a particularly high rate of injury, 3.5 per 1000 starts.<ref name="WP">Rosenblatt [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/23/AR2007042301231.html "Barbaro's Legacy"] ''Washington Post''</ref> Thoroughbreds also have other health concerns, including a majority of animals who are prone to bleeding from the lungs ([[EIPH]]), 10% with low fertility, and 5% with abnormally small hearts.<ref name="Pickrell"/>  Thoroughbreds also tend to have smaller hooves relative to their body mass than other breeds, with thin soles and walls and a lack of cartilage mass,<ref name="ppt">{{cite web |url= http://www.grayson-jockeyclub.org/newsimages/toe_grabs.ppt |title= The Detrimental Effects of Toe Grabs |format=ppt |accessdate=2008-02-17 |author= Casner, Bill |date=2007-04 |accessdate=2008-02-17}}</ref> which contributes to foot soreness, the most common source of lameness in racehorses.<ref>Arthur ''Diagnosis and Management of Lameness in the Horse'' p. 872</ref>

===Selective breeding===
One argument for the health issues involving Thoroughbreds suggests that [[inbreeding]] is the culprit.<ref name="Pickrell"/> It has also been suggested that capability for speed is enhanced in an already swift animal by raising [[muscle]] mass, a form of [[selective breeding]] that has created animals designed to win [[horse racing|horse races]].<ref name=Kluger>Kluger "Bred for Speed...Built for Trouble" ''Time Magazine''</ref> Thus, according to one theory, the modern Thoroughbred travels faster than its skeletal structure can support.<ref name=Finley>Finley "Sadly, No Way to Stop Deaths" ''New York Daily News''</ref>  Veterinarian Robert Miller states that "We have selectively bred for speeds that the anatomy of the horse cannot always cope with."<ref name="Miller">Miller [http://www.equine-reproduction.com/articles/Horse-Lovers.shtml "And They Call Us Horse Lovers"] ''Cowboy Magazine''</ref>

===Excess stress===
A high accident rate may also occur because Thoroughbreds, particularly in the [[United States]], are first raced as 2-year-olds, well before they are completely mature. Though they may appear full-grown and are in superb muscular condition, their bones are not fully formed.<ref name="Miller"/> However, catastrophic injury rates are higher in 4- and 5-year-olds than in 2- and 3-year-olds.<ref>Bourke "Fatalities on racecourses in Victoria" ''Proceedings of the 10th International Conference of Racing Analysts and Veterinarians</ref>  Studies have shown that track surfaces,<ref>Oikawa "Effect of restructuring of a racetrack on the occurrence of racing injuries in thoroughbred horses" ''Journal of Equine Veterinary Science</ref> [[horseshoe]]s with toe grabs,<ref name="ppt"/> use of certain legal medications,<ref name=PETA>{{cite web |url= http://www.peta.org/mc/factsheet_display.asp?ID=65 |title= The Horseracing Industry: Drugs, Deception and Death |accessdate=2008-02-17 |author=PETA  |work=PETA Media Center |publisher=People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals}}</ref> and high-intensity racing schedules may also contribute to a high injury rate.<ref name=USAToday>Pedulla [http://www.usatoday.com/sports/horses/triple/2006-06-04-triple-crown-scrutiny_x.htm "Injury steps up scrutiny on Triple Crown Schedule"] ''USA Today''</ref> One promising trend is the development of synthetic surfaces for racetracks, and one of the first tracks to install such a surface, Turfway Park in Florence, Kentucky, saw its rate of fatal breakdowns drop from 24 in 2004&ndash;05 to three in the year following Polytrack installation. The material is not perfected, and some areas report problems related to winter weather, but studies are continuing.<ref name="WP"/>

===Medical challenges===
The level of treatment given to injured Thoroughbreds is often more intensive than for horses of lesser financial value<ref name=BaltSun>Walker [http://www.baltimoresun.com/sports/bal-te.sp.racing30jan30,0,3354975.story "Barbaro's injury highlighted problems, medical advances"] ''Baltimore Sun''</ref>  but also controversial, due in part to the significant challenges in treating broken bones and other major leg injuries.<ref name="NYT">Grady [http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/23/sports/othersports/23leg.html?pagewanted=1&_r=2 "State of the Art to Save Barbaro"] ''The New York Times''</ref> Leg injuries that are not immediately fatal still may be life-threatening because a horse's weight must be distributed evenly on all four legs to prevent [[circulatory system of the horse|circulatory]] problems, [[laminitis]] and other infections. If a horse loses the use of one leg temporarily, there is the risk that other legs will break down during the recovery period because they are carrying an abnormal weight load. While horses periodically lie down for brief periods of time, a horse cannot remain lying in the equivalent of a human's "[[bed rest]]" because of the risk of developing sores and internal damage and congestion.<ref name="NYT"/>

Whenever a racing accident severely injures a well-known horse, such as the major leg fractures that led to the [[animal euthanasia|euthanization]] of 2006 [[Kentucky Derby]] winner [[Barbaro]], or 2008 Kentucky Derby runner-up [[Eight Belles]], [[animal rights]] groups have denounced the Thoroughbred racing industry.<ref name=PETABarbaro>{{cite web |url=http://www.peta.org/campaigns/barbaro.asp |title= Barbaro's Tragic Injury: A Symptom of a Cruel Industry |accessdate=2008-02-17 |author=PETA |work= PETA.org Campaigns |publisher= People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals}}</ref> On the other hand, advocates of racing argue that without horse racing, far less funding and incentives would be available for medical and biomechanical research on horses.<ref name=HBLB>{{cite web |url= http://www.hblb.org.uk/document.php?id=14 |title= Advancing Veterinary Science and Education |accessdate=2008-02-17 |author=Horserace Levy Betting Board staff  |work= Horserace Levy Betting Board Web Site  |publisher= Horserace Levy Betting Board}} </ref>  Although horse racing is hazardous, veterinary science has advanced. Previously hopeless cases can now be treated,<ref name="NYT"/> and earlier detection through advanced imaging techniques like [[scintigraphy]] can keep at-risk horses off the track.<ref>Mackey "Stress fractures of the humerus, radius and tibia in horses" ''Veterinary Radiology''</ref>
