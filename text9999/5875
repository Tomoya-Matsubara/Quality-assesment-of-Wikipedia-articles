The '''Los Angeles Dodgers''' are a [[Major League Baseball]] team based in [[Los Angeles, California]], USA. The team is in the Western Division of the [[National League]]. Established in [[1883]], the team originated in [[Brooklyn, New York]], where it was known as the '''Brooklyn Dodgers''', before moving to Los Angeles before the [[1958]] season.

==Team History==
===Early Brooklyn baseball===
[[Brooklyn]] was home to outstanding [[baseball]] clubs in the mid-[[1850s]]. Eight of 16 participants in the [[National Association of Base Ball Players|first convention]] were from Brooklyn, including the [[Brooklyn Atlantics|Atlantic]], [[Brooklyn Eckfords|Eckford]] and [[Brooklyn Excelsiors|Excelsior]] clubs that combined to dominate play for most of the [[1860s]]. Brooklyn helped make baseball commercial, as the locale of the first paid admission games, a series of three all star contests matching New York and Brooklyn in [[1858 in sports|1858]]. Brooklyn also featured the first two enclosed baseball grounds, the [[Union Grounds]] and the [[Capitoline Grounds]]; enclosed, dedicated ballparks accelerated the evolution from [[amateur]]ism to [[professional]]ism. 

Despite the success of Brooklyn clubs in the first Association, officially amateur until 1869, they fielded weak teams in the succeeding [[National Association of Professional Base Ball Players]], the first professional league formed in [[1871]]. The Excelsiors no longer challenged for the amateur championship after the war and never entered the professional NA. The Eckfords and Atlantics declined to join until [[1872]] and thereby lost their best players; Eckford survived only one season and Atlantic four, with losing teams.

The [[National League]] replaced the NA in 1876 and granted exclusive territories to its eight members, excluding the Atlantics in favor of the [[New York Mutuals]] who had shared the same home grounds. When the Mutuals were expelled by the League, the [[Hartford Dark Blues]] club moved in, changed its name to '''The Brooklyn Hartfords''' and played its home games at Union Grounds in 1877 before disbanding. They were also the Brooklyn Superbas for a little while.

===Brooklyn Dodgers===

The Brooklyn baseball club that eventually became the NL Dodgers was established in 1883, and the team joined the upstart [[American Association (19th century)|American Association]] the following year. Originally the Brooklyn team was known as the "Atlantics" (a reference to the earlier National Association team), and later as the "Grays." After several of the team's players were married in succession in 1888, the press began referring to the team as the "Brooklyn Bridegrooms." The Bridegrooms won the AA pennant in [[1889]]. Upon switching to the [[National League]] in [[1890]], the franchise became the first of only three major league sports teams, and the only major league baseball team, to win championships in different leagues in consecutive years. (The other two sports teams to win consecutive championships in different leagues were the 1948-1949 [[Los Angeles Lakers|Minneapolis Lakers]] and the 1949-1950 [[Cleveland Browns]].) Eight years passed before any more success followed. Because of joint ownership between the two clubs, several [[Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] players were sold to Brooklyn by the soon-to-be-defunct [[Baltimore Orioles (NL)|Baltimore Orioles]], along with their manager, [[Ned Hanlon (baseball)|Ned Hanlon]]. This catapulted Brooklyn to instant contention, and "Brooklyn Superbas" (as the team was known in the late 1890s because the manager shared a surname with "Hanlon's Superbas," a popular acrobatic troupe at the time) lived up to their name, winning pennants in [[1899]] and [[1900]]. 

Teams of this era played in two principal ballparks, [[Washington Park]] and [[Eastern Park]]. They first earned the nickname "[[Trolley Dodger]]s," later shortened to Dodgers, while at [[Eastern Park]] during the [[1890s]] because of the difficulty fans (and players) had in reaching the ballpark due to the number of trolley lines in the area. The name "Trolley Dodgers" is recorded separately in two newspapers on [[September 3]], [[1895]]. <ref>[http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/trolley_dodgers_national_league_baseball_team_now_in_los_angeles/ Barry Popik blog, "Trolley Dodgers National League Baseball Team Now in Los Angeles]</ref> The club also engaged in a series of mergers during this period, acquiring the [[New York Metropolitans]] in [[1888]] for territorial protection and star contracts, merging with the [[Brooklyn Wonders]] in [[1891]] as part of the [[Players League]] settlement, and merging with the [[Baltimore Orioles (NL)]] in [[1900]] as part of the [[National League]]'s consolidation of clubs.

In 1902, Hanlon expressed his desire to buy a controlling interest in the team and move it (back, effectively) to [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]]. His plan was blocked by a lifelong club employee, [[Charles Ebbets]], who put himself heavily in debt to buy the team and keep it in the borough. Ebbets' ambition did not stop at owning the team. He desired to replace the dilapidated [[Washington Park]] with a new ballpark, and again invested heavily to finance the construction of [[Ebbets Field]], which would become the Dodgers' home for 45 seasons starting in [[1913 in sports|1913]] and ending after the 1957 season.

===Rivalry with the Giants===
{{main|Dodgers-Giants rivalry}}

The historic and heated rivalry between the Dodgers and the [[San Francisco Giants|Giants]] is more than a century old, and is the longest rivalry in baseball history, having begun when both clubs played in New York City (the Dodgers in [[Brooklyn]] and the Giants in [[Manhattan]]). When both franchises moved to [[California]] in [[1958]], the rivalry was easily transplanted with them, as the cities of [[Los Angeles]] and [[San Francisco]] have long been rivals in economic, cultural, and political arenas throughout the history of the State of California.

===<U+201C>Uncle Robbie<U+201D> and the <U+201C>Daffiness Boys<U+201D>===
Manager Wilbert Robinson, another former [[Baltimore Orioles (NL)|Oriole]], popularly known as <U+201C>Uncle Robbie,<U+201D> restored the Brooklyn team to respectability, with his <U+201C>Brooklyn Robins<U+201D> winning pennants to reach the [[1916 World Series|1916]] and [[1920 World Series]], losing both, but contending perennially for several seasons. Charles Ebbetts and Ed McKeever died within a week in 1925, and Robbie was named president while still field manager. Upon assuming the title of president, however, Robinson<U+2019>s ability to focus on the field declined, and the teams of the late [[1920s]] were often fondly referred to as the <U+201C>Daffiness Boys<U+201D> for their distracted, error-ridden style of play.  Outfielder [[Babe Herman]] was the leader both in hitting and in zaniness. After his removal as club president, Robinson returned to managing, and the club<U+2019>s performance rebounded somewhat. 

At this time, the only other person with Dodger stock was Steve McKeever, who held onto his stock until his death in 1938.
His daughter Helen McKeever Darvey held onto her inherited 25% interest until 1975, when she finally sold out to O'Malley.

When Robinson retired in 1931, he was replaced as manager by [[Max Carey]].  Although some suggested renaming the "Robins" the "Brooklyn Canaries," after Carey (whose last name was originally "Carnarius"), the name "Brooklyn Dodgers" returned to stay following Robinson's retirement.  It was during this era that [[Willard Mullin]], a noted sports [[cartoonist]], fixed the Brooklyn team with the lovable nickname of '''<U+201C>Dem Bums.<U+201D>'''  After hearing his cab driver ask "So how did those bums do today?" Mullin decided to sketch an exaggerated version of famed circus clown [[Emmett Kelly]] to represent the Dodgers in his much-praised cartoons in the ''[[New York World-Telegram]].'' Both the image and the nickname caught on, so much so that many a Dodger yearbook cover, from 1951 through 1957, featured a Willard Mullin illustration with the Brooklyn Bum.

Perhaps the highlight of the Daffiness Boys era came after Wilbert Robinson had left the dugout. In [[1934 in baseball|1934]], Giants player/manager [[Bill Terry]] was asked about the Dodgers<U+2019> chances in the coming pennant race and cracked infamously, <U+201C>Is Brooklyn still in the league?<U+201D>  Managed now by [[Casey Stengel]] (who played for the Dodgers in the [[1910s]] and would go on to greatness managing [[New York Yankees|another team]]), the 1934 Dodgers were determined to make their presence felt.  As it happened, the season ended with the Giants tied with the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] for the pennant, with the Giants<U+2019> remaining games against the Dodgers.  Stengel led his Bums to the [[Polo Grounds]] for the showdown and they beat the Giants twice to knock them out of the pennant race. The <U+201C>[[Gashouse Gang]]<U+201D> Cardinals nailed the pennant by beating the [[Cincinnati Reds]] those same two days.

One key development during this era was the 1938 appointment of Leland Stanford MacPhail &mdash; better known as [[Larry MacPhail]] &mdash; as the Dodgers' general manager. MacPhail, who brought night baseball to MLB as general manager of the Reds, also introduced Brooklyn to night baseball and ordered the successful refurbishing of Ebbets Field. He also brought Reds voice [[Red Barber]] to Brooklyn as the Dodgers' lead announcer in 1939, just after MacPhail broke the New York baseball executives' agreement to ban live baseball broadcasts, enacted because of the fear of what the radio calls would have on the home teams' attendance.

MacPhail remained with the Dodgers until 1942, when he returned to the Armed Forces for [[World War II]]. (He later became one of the [[New York Yankees]]' co-owners, bidding unsuccessfully for Barber to join him in the Bronx as announcer.) MacPhail's surviving son Leland Jr. ([[Lee MacPhail]]) and surviving grandson [[Andy MacPhail]] also became MLB execs.

The first major-league baseball game to be [[televised]] was Brooklyn<U+2019>s 6-1 victory over [[Cincinnati Reds|Cincinnati]] at Ebbets Field on [[August 26]], [[1939]]. [[Batting helmet]]s were introduced to Major League Baseball by the Dodgers in [[1941]].

===Breaking the color barrier===
For most of the first half of the [[20th century]], no Major League Baseball team employed an [[African-American]] player. A parallel system of [[Negro league baseball|Negro Leagues]] developed, but most of the Negro League players were denied a chance to prove their skill before a national audience.  [[Jackie Robinson]] became the first African-American to play for a Major League Baseball team when he played his first major-league game on [[April 15]], [[1947]], as a member of the Brooklyn Dodgers. It happened mainly due to General Manager [[Branch Rickey]]'s efforts. The deeply religious Rickey's motivation appears to have been primarily moral although business considerations were also present.  Rickey was a member of [[The Methodist Church (USA)| The Methodist Church]], the antecedent denomination to [[The United Methodist Church]] of today, which was a strong advocate for [[social justice]] and active later in the [[Civil Rights movement]].  (''[[The New York Times]]'': {{cite news | title=Branch Rickey, 83, Dies in Missouri | url=http://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/1220.html}}) 

This event was the harbinger of the integration of sports in the United States, the concomitant demise of the [[Negro Leagues]], and is regarded as a key moment in the history of the American [[American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968)|Civil Rights movement]]. Robinson was an exceptional player, a speedy [[stolen base|runner]] who sparked the whole team with his intensity, and was given the inaugural [[MLB Rookie of the Year Award|Rookie of the Year]] award, which is now named the Jackie Robinson award in his honor. Robinson would eventually go on to become the first African-American elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1962.

===<U+201C>Wait <U+2019>til next year!<U+201D>===
[[Image:1955 next year.jpg|thumb|right|Brooklyn Dodgers win the 1955 World Series. ]]
After the wilderness years of the 1920s and 1930s, the Dodgers were rebuilt into a contending club first by general manager [[Larry MacPhail]] and then the legendary [[Branch Rickey]].  Led by [[Pee Wee Reese]], [[Jackie Robinson]] and [[Gil Hodges]] in the infield, [[Duke Snider]] in center field, [[Roy Campanella]] behind the plate, and [[Don Newcombe]] on the pitcher's mound, the Dodgers won pennants in [[1941 World Series|1941]], [[1947 World Series|1947]], [[1949 World Series|1949]], [[1952 World Series|1952]], and [[1953 World Series|1953]], only to fall to the [[New York Yankees]] in all five of the subsequent World Series.
The annual ritual of building excitement, followed in the end by disappointment, became old hat to the long suffering fans, and '''<U+201C>Wait <U+2019>til next year!<U+201D>''' became an unofficial Dodger slogan.

While the Dodgers generally enjoyed resounding success during this period, in [[1951 in baseball|1951]] they fell victim to one of the largest collapses in the history of baseball. On [[August 11]], Brooklyn led the National League by an enormous 13<U+00BD> games over their archrivals, the Giants. However, while the Dodgers went 26-22 from that time until the end of the season, the Giants went on an absolute tear, winning an amazing 37 of their last 44 games, including their last seven in a row. At the conclusion of the season, the Dodgers and the Giants were tied for first place, forcing a three-game playoff for the pennant. The Giants took Game 1 by a score of 3-1 before being shut out by the Dodgers' [[Clem Labine]] in Game 2, 10-0. It all came down to the final game, and Brooklyn seemed to have the pennant locked up, holding a 4-2 lead in the bottom of the ninth inning. However, Giants third baseman [[Bobby Thomson]] hit a stunning three-run [[walk-off home run]] off the Dodgers' [[Ralph Branca]] to secure the NL Championship in dramatic fashion for New York. Today, this home run is known as the [[Shot Heard 'Round the World (baseball)|Shot Heard 'Round The World]] and, despite the crushing blow it represented for the Dodgers, is widely regarded as the greatest moment in baseball history.

In [[1955 World Series|1955]], by which time the core of the Dodger team was beginning to age, <U+201C>next year<U+201D> finally came. The fabled <U+201C>Boys of Summer<U+201D> shot down the "Bronx Bombers" in seven games, led by the first-class pitching of young left-hander [[Johnny Podres]], whose key pitch was a [[changeup]] known as <U+201C>pulling down the lampshade<U+201D> because of the arm motion used right when the ball was released. Podres won two Series games, including the deciding seventh. The turning point of Game 7 was a spectacular double play that began with left fielder [[Sandy Amoros]] running down [[Yogi Berra]]<U+2019>s long fly, then throwing perfectly to [[shortstop]] [[Pee Wee Reese]], who doubled up a surprised [[Gil McDougald]] at first base to preserve the Dodger lead.

Although the Dodgers lost the World Series to the Yankees in [[1956 World Series|1956]] (during which the Yankees pitcher [[Don Larsen]] pitched the  only postseason [[perfect game]] in baseball history), it hardly seemed to matter. Brooklyn fans had their memory of triumph, and soon that would be all they were left with &ndash; a victory that decades later would later be remembered in the [[Billy Joel]] single "[[We Didn't Start the Fire]]," which included the line, "Brooklyn's got a winning team."

===Move to California===
[[Image:5262 1062164538.jpg|thumb|left|Walter O'Malley]]
Real estate businessman [[Walter O'Malley]] had acquired majority ownership of the Dodgers in [[1950]], when he bought the shares of his co-owners, the estate of the late John L. Smith and [[Branch Rickey]]. Before long he was working to buy new land in Brooklyn to build a more accessible and better arrayed ballpark than Ebbets Field. Beloved as it was, Ebbets Field had grown old and was not well served by infrastructure, to the point where the Dodgers could not sell the park out even in the heat of a pennant race (despite largely dominating the league from [[1946 in baseball|1946]] to [[1957 in baseball|1957]]).

New York City Construction Coordinator [[Robert Moses]], however, sought to force O'Malley into using a site in [[Flushing Meadows Park|Flushing Meadows]], [[Queens, New York|Queens]] &ndash; the site for what eventually became [[Shea Stadium]]. Moses' vision involved a city-built, city-owned park, which was greatly at odds with O'Malley's real-estate savvy. When it became clear to O'Malley that he was not going to be allowed to buy any suitable land in Brooklyn, he began thinking elsewhere.

Meanwhile, non-stop transcontinental air travel had become routine during the years since the [[Second World War]], and teams were no longer bound by much slower railroad timetables. Because of these transportation advances, it became possible to locate teams further apart &ndash; as far west as California &ndash; while maintaining the same game schedules. 

When Los Angeles officials attended the [[1955 World Series]] looking to entice a team to move to the City of Angels, they were not even thinking of the Dodgers.  Their original target had been the lowly Washington Senators (who would in fact move to [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis]] and become the [[Minnesota Twins]] in [[1961 in baseball|1961]]).  At the same time, O'Malley was looking for a contingency in case Moses and other New York politicians refused to let him build the Brooklyn stadium he wanted, and sent word to the Los Angeles officials that he was interested in talking. Los Angeles offered him what New York would not: a chance to buy land suitable for building a ballpark. 

Meanwhile, Giants owner [[Horace Stoneham]] was having similar difficulty finding a replacement for his team's antiquated home stadium, the Polo Grounds. Stoneham was considering moving the Giants to Minneapolis, but was persuaded instead to move them to San Francisco, ensuring that the Dodgers would have a National League rival closer than St. Louis. So the two arch-rival teams, the Dodgers and Giants, moved out to the West Coast together after the 1957 season. 

The Brooklyn Dodgers played their final game at [[Ebbets Field]] on [[September 24]], [[1957 in baseball|1957]], which the Dodgers won 2-0 over the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]]. On [[June 24]], [[2007 in baseball|2007]]  spectators at [[KeySpan Park]] in Brooklyn, home of the [[New York Mets]] [[Single-A]] team, the [[Brooklyn Cyclones]],  watched [[Danny McDevitt]], who threw the last pitch for the Brooklyn Dodgers re-enact that moment with his catcher [[Joe Pignatano]], who caught McDevitt's ball in 1957. [http://wcbstv.com/topstories/local_story_176064150.html 'Brooklyn' Dodgers Celebrate 50th Anniversary]

On [[April 18]], [[1958 in baseball|1958]], the Los Angeles Dodgers played their first game in LA, defeating the former New York and now new San Francisco Giants, 6-5, before 78,672 fans at the [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]].

A 2007 [[HBO]] film, ''[[Brooklyn Dodgers: The Ghosts of Flatbush]]'', is a documentary covering the Dodgers history from early days to the beginning of the Los Angeles era.

====Who is to Blame?====
There has been much controversy over the move of the Dodgers to California, perhaps more than over any other franchise move of that era.  Walter O'Malley, in particular, is described as villainous by old Brooklyn Dodger fans and is considered a hero by Angelenos for bringing a big-league team to their city. (An old Brooklyn barb is that the three greatest villains of the Twentieth Century were [[Hitler]], [[Stalin]], and O'Malley.) The joke is if a fan was locked in a room with the three and had only two bullets who would he shoot?  The Answer? O'Malley. Twice.<ref>In the [[HBO]] documentary ''Brooklyn Dodgers: The Ghosts of Flatbush'', a fan is quoted as saying, "You're in a room with Hitler, Stalin and Walter O'Malley and you have a gun with two bullets: Who do you shoot? And of course the Dodger fans would say, 'You shoot O'Malley twice.'" Another says, "Walter O'Malley is down there in the seventh ring of [[Dante]]'s Hell on the list of the most vile people of the [[20th century]]." Others defend O'Malley's move, blaming [[Robert Moses]] and other [[New York City]] officials.</ref> The old Brooklyn Dodgers fans further believe he demonstrated some measure of selfishness and greed, but the same might also be said of the New York City politicians who opposed him. Both sides were quite stubborn and fatally misjudged each other. It also should be noted that Brooklyn had declined in many ways, under various social pressures, and was a much less desirable location for a baseball team than it had been. In fact, both sides in the stadium dispute proposed to remove the Dodgers from Brooklyn (Moses' plan for a team in Flushing Meadows was realized several years later, with little alteration, when the [[New York Mets]] began playing in Shea Stadium). O'Malley also deserves credit as a visionary. Until 1958, cities in [[Missouri]] had generally been the westernmost outpost of Major League Baseball, whereas 12 of baseball's 30 teams now have their homes farther west.

On the opposite side, the Dodgers were the second-most profitable team in the National League in the 1950s, even with the deficiencies of Ebbets Field.  Other teams (like the [[Boston Red Sox]]) proved successful in facilities that were as old as Ebbets Field, and the [[New York Yankees]] still drew large crowds to [[the Bronx]], in a neighborhood facing many of the changes and problems as Brooklyn. Moses' motives for opposing O'Malley's stadium may not have been without foundation: the Dodgers' owner wanted to drop a cookie-cutter [[Brooklyn Dodgers proposed domed stadium|domed stadium]] at the busy intersection of Atlantic and Flatbush Avenues in [[Prospect Heights, Brooklyn|Prospect Heights]], which would have required a massive [[urban renewal]] project that would have been politically and financially problematic.<ref>[http://www.covehurst.net/ddyte/brooklyn/never_were.html Ballparks That Never Were]</ref> Moses also felt the development there would create a "China Wall" of traffic.  The site remains problematic: The proposed [[Atlantic Yards]] development in Prospect Heights, including an arena across the street from the proposed Dodger Stadium site that would house the [[NBA]]'s [[New Jersey Nets]] team, has run into opposition from Brooklyn politicians and community activists, who say its scale could ruin the neighborhood's character.

Many writers have suspected O'Malley of deliberately making his stadium proposal impractical, in order to bolster his claim that New York politicians drove him out of Brooklyn.  It has been noted that O'Malley kept a model of the Dodgers' new stadium on his desk and publicly touted its merits while privately negotiating with Los Angeles politicians.  Many Moses scholars would, however, point to Moses' almost pathologically uncompromising nature; Moses was openly dismissive of public and press criticism of his projects, and the political structure of New York City in the 1950s was such that he nearly always got his way.  Still, prominent New York leaders learned how to deal with Moses for mutually beneficial projects: [[Francis Cardinal Spellman]] was even able to pressure Moses to build a Manhattan expansion for [[Fordham University]].  By the 1950s, only Queens had large undeveloped areas of land in New York City (not counting [[Staten Island]], as the [[Verrazano Bridge]] would not be completed until 1964), a fact of which O'Malley was keenly aware.

Moreover, O'Malley was hardly the first team owner to see the possibilities of Los Angeles.  The [[St. Louis Browns]] were attempting to move to LA after the 1941 season. A vote on the proposed relocation was to take place at an owners' meeting scheduled for [[December 8]], [[1941]]. This was canceled due to the Japanese attacks on [[Pearl Harbor]] the previous day.  [[Kansas City Athletics]] owner Arnold Johnson was rumored to have parked the A's in Kansas City while waiting to move the team out to California, and the American League would expand to Los Angeles in [[1961 in baseball|1961]].  

During the [[2000 World Series]], [[Roger Kahn]] wrote an Op-Ed for the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' in which he recalled sitting on a panel of New York State and City officials to explore the purchase of the Dodgers.  The O'Malley family put the team up for sale in [[1998 in baseball|1998]], and the panel was charged with exploring the possibility of moving the Dodgers back to Brooklyn.  Kahn said the officials came up with a preliminary offer that was rejected by the O'Malleys; the figure, he said, was larger than the price [[Rupert Murdoch]] eventually paid for the team.  Kahn argued that the O'Malleys rejected the offer because the story of the Dodgers being thrown out of New York was an essential part of the team's mythology.  Kahn said the O'Malleys needed the myth more than the money. Peter O'Malley has stated he would only sell the team to someone who kept a commitment to Los Angeles and Southern California[http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,137160,00.html][[Time]].

===New start===
The process of building Walter O'Malley's dream stadium soon began in semi-rural [[Chavez Ravine]], in the hills just north of downtown L.A.  There was some political controversy, as the residents of the ravine, mostly [[Hispanic]] and mostly poor, resisted the [[eminent domain]] removal of their homes (land which had been previously condemned for a public housing project, [[Elysian Park]] Heights) and gained some public sympathy. Still, O'Malley and the city government were determined, and construction proceeded. The resistance of the residents against their removal was known as the ''[[Battle of Chavez Ravine]]''. 
[[Image:DodgerStadium 2006-06-01.jpg|300px|right|thumb|Dodger Stadium at dusk]] 
In the meantime, the Dodgers played their home games from [[1958 in baseball|1958]] to [[1961 in baseball|1961]] at the [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]], a gargantuan football and track-and-field stadium that had been built to host the [[1932 Summer Olympics]]. The Coliseum's dimensions were not optimal for baseball, and the only way to fit a diamond into the oval-shaped stadium was to lay the third-base line along the short axis of the oval, and the first-base line along the long axis.  [http://www.ballparkwatch.com/stadiums/past/la_coliseum.htm See picture.]  This resulted in a left-field fence that was only some 250 feet from home plate, and a 40-foot screen was erected to prevent home runs from becoming too easy to hit. Still, the [[1958 in baseball|1958 season]] saw 182 home runs hit to left field in the Coliseum, while only 3 were hit to center field and 8 to right field. Dodgers outfielder [[Wally Moon]], newly acquired for the [[1959 in baseball|1959 season]], became adept at launching lazy fly balls over the screen, which became known as "Moon shots."  

In 1959, the season ended in a tie between the Dodgers and the [[Milwaukee Braves]], and the Dodgers won the tie-breaking playoff. 1959 also saw a team other than the [[New York Yankees|Yankees]] win the A.L. pennant, one of only two such years in the 16-year stretch from [[1949 in baseball|1949]] through [[1964 in baseball|1964]].  In a lively [[1959 World Series|World Series]], the Dodgers defeated the "Go-Go" [[Chicago White Sox|White Sox]] in six games, thoroughly cementing the bond between the team and its new California fans.

===The 1960s: Pitching, defense, and speed===
<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:DonDrysdale2.jpg|thumb|Hall of Famer Don Drysdale]] -->
Construction on [[Dodger Stadium]] was completed in time for Opening Day [[1962]].  With its clean, simple lines and its picturesque setting amid hills and palm trees, the ballpark quickly became an icon of the Dodgers and their new California lifestyle, and it remains one of the most highly-regarded stadiums in baseball even today. Despite the fact that the Dodgers have played in Dodger Stadium longer than they had played in Ebbett's Field, the stadium remains surprisingly fresh. O'Malley was determined that there would not be a bad seat in the house, achieving this by [[cantilever]]ed grandstands that have since been widely imitated.  More importantly for the team, the stadium's spacious dimensions, along with other factors, gave defense an advantage over offense, and the Dodgers moved to take advantage of this by assembling a team that would excel with its [[pitching]].  

The core of the team's success in the 1960s was the dominant pitching tandem of [[Sandy Koufax]] and [[Don Drysdale]], who combined to win 4 of the 5 [[Cy Young Award]]s from 1962 to 1966, during a time in which only one award was given to the top pitcher from either of the two major leagues.  Top pitching also came from [[Claude Osteen]], an aging [[Johnny Podres]], and reliever [[Ron Perranoski]].  The hitting attack, on the other hand, was not impressive, and much of the offensive spark came from the exploits of speedy shortstop [[Maury Wills]], who led the league in [[stolen bases]] every year from 1960 to 1965, and set a modern record with 104 thefts in [[1962]].  The Dodgers' strategy was once described as follows:  ''"Wills hits a single, steals second, and takes third on a grounder.  A sacrifice fly brings him home.  Koufax or Drysdale pitches a shutout, and the Dodgers win 1-0."''  Although few games followed this model exactly, the Dodgers indeed won a great many low-scoring games.  

<!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:Koufax2.jpg|left|thumb|Hall of Famer Sandy Koufax]] -->
The [[1962 in baseball|1962]] pennant race ended in a tie, and the Dodgers were defeated by the archrival [[San Francisco Giants|Giants]] in the tie-breaking playoff, but the Dodgers proceeded to win the pennant in three of the next four years.  The [[1963 World Series]] was a 4-game sweep of the [[New York Yankees|Yankees]], in which the Dodgers were so dominant that the vaunted Bronx Bombers never even took a lead against Koufax, Podres, and Drysdale.  After an injury-plagued [[1964 in baseball|1964]], the Dodgers bounced back to win the [[1965 World Series]] in a thrilling 7 games against the [[Minnesota Twins]]. Game 1 happened to fall on [[Yom Kippur]], and Koufax (who is [[Jewish]]) refused to pitch on the holy day, a decision for which he was widely praised.  The Dodgers rebounded from losing the first two games, as Koufax pitched [[shutout]]s in Games 5 and 7 (with only two days rest in between) to win the crown and the [[World Series MVP Award]].

The Dodgers again won the pennant in [[1966 in baseball|1966]], but the team was running out of gas and was swept in the [[1966 World Series|World Series]] by the upstart [[Baltimore Orioles]] (who went on to a successful run through the late '60s and early '70s).  Koufax retired that winter, his career cut short by arthritis in the elbow of his pitching arm, and Wills was traded away after offending Walter O'Malley.  Drysdale continued to be effective, setting a record for consecutive scoreless innings in [[1968 in baseball|1968]], but he too retired early due to injuries.  While the Dodgers were subpar for several seasons thereafter, a new core of young talent was developing in their [[Minor league baseball|farm system]].  They won another pennant in [[1974 in baseball|1974]], and although they were quickly dismissed by the dynastic [[Oakland Athletics]] in the [[1974 World Series|World Series]], it was a sign of good things to come.

===The late 1970s: The early Lasorda years===
<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:TommyOlympics5.jpg|thumb|Hall of Fame manager and beloved Dodger figure Tommy Lasorda]] -->
For 23 years, beginning in [[1954 in baseball|1954]], the Dodgers had been managed by [[Walter Alston]], a quiet and unflappable man who commanded great respect from his players. Alston's tenure is the third-longest in baseball history for a manager with a single team, after [[Connie Mack (baseball)|Connie Mack]] and [[John McGraw (baseball)|John McGraw]]. His retirement near the end of the [[1976 in baseball|1976]] season, after winning 7 pennants and 4 World Series titles over his career, cleared the way for an entirely different personality to take the helm of the Dodgers.  

[[Tommy Lasorda]] was a 49-year-old former minor-league pitcher who had been the team's top coach under Alston, and before that had been manager of the Dodgers' top minor league team. He was colorful and gregarious, an enthusiastic cheerleader in contrast to Alston's taciturn demeanor. He quickly became a larger-than-life personality, associating with [[Frank Sinatra]] and other celebrities, with a penchant for eating Italian food in large volumes. He became well-known for sayings such as, "If you cut me, I bleed [[Dodger blue]]," and for referring to [[God]] as "the Great Dodger in the sky."  Although some considered his persona to be a [[schtick]] and found it wearing, his enthusiasm won him a reputation as an "ambassador for baseball," and it is impossible to think of the Dodgers from the late '70s to the early '90s without thinking of Lasorda.  

Another transition had recently occurred, higher up in the Dodgers management.  Walter O'Malley passed control of the team to his son [[Peter O'Malley|Peter]], who would continue to oversee the Dodgers on his family's behalf through [[1998]]. 

New blood had also been injected into the team on the field.  The core of the team was now the infield, composed of [[Steve Garvey]] (1B), [[Davey Lopes]] (2B), [[Bill Russell (baseball)|Bill Russell]] (SS), and [[Ron Cey]] (3B). These four remained in the starting lineup together from 1973 to 1981, longer than any other infield foursome in baseball history.  The pitching staff remained strong, anchored by [[Don Sutton]] and [[Tommy John]]. The Dodgers won [[NL West]] titles in both [[1977 in baseball|1977]] and [[1978 in baseball|1978]], and defeated the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] both years in the [[National League Championship Series]], only to be defeated in the World Series both years by the [[New York Yankees|Yankees]]. In [[1980 in baseball|1980]], they swept a three game series from the [[Houston Astros]] in the final weekend of the regular season (including Don Sutton's brilliant save) and were in a first place tie in the National League West, but lost to the Astros 7-1 in the one-game playoff.

===The 1980s: Fernandomania and the Bulldog===
<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:GIBSPHU016001.jpg|thumb|Kirk Gibson after hitting his 1988 World Series Game 1 home run]] -->

The Opening Day starting pitcher for [[1981]] was a 20-year-old rookie from Mexico: [[Fernando Valenzuela]]. 
Pressed into service due to an injury to [[Jerry Reuss]], Valenzuela pitched a [[shutout]] that day, and proceeded to win his first 8 decisions through mid-May. The youthful left-hander, speaking only Spanish but sporting a devastating [[screwball]], became a sensation. <U+201C>Fernandomania<U+201D> gripped both Southern California, where huge crowds turned out to see him pitch, as well as in his home country of Mexico, where the number of radio stations that carried Dodger games increased that year from 3 stations to 17. <ref>[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2006/writers/alex_belth/08/04/five.phenoms/index.html The true phenoms: Five pitchers who became national sensations] [[4 August]] [[2006]]</ref> Valenzuela became the only pitcher ever to be named [[MLB Rookie of the Year Award|Rookie of the Year]] and win the [[Cy Young Award]] in the same season. The Dodgers' torrid start assured them of a playoff berth in the [[1981 Major League Baseball strike|strike-shortened]] split season. After defeating the [[Montreal Expos]] with the help of a ninth-inning two-out home run by [[Rick Monday]] in the 5th and deciding game of the National League Championship Series they proceeded to defeat the [[New York Yankees|Yankees]] in the [[1981 World Series|World Series]] in six games, with the World Series MVP award split three ways among [[Ron Cey]], [[Pedro Guerrero]] and [[Steve Yeager]].  

The Dodgers won [[NL West]] titles in [[1983 in baseball|1983]] and [[1985 in baseball|1985]], but lost in the NLCS both those years (to the [[Philadelphia Phillies|Phillies]] and [[St. Louis Cardinals|Cardinals]], respectively).  The 1985 NLCS was particularly memorable for Game 6, in which the Dodgers were protecting a 5-4 lead in the ninth inning, hoping to force a deciding seventh game.  With two runners on and first base open, Lasorda elected not to [[base on balls|walk]] Cards slugger [[Jack Clark (baseball)|Jack Clark]], who proceeded to hit a home run off [[Tom Niedenfuer]] and send St. Louis to the World Series.  

After seven years of high [[strikeout]] totals, and a 21-win season in [[1986]], Valenzuela sat out for most of the [[1988 in baseball|1988]] season. Plagued by arm troubles that were widely blamed on his being overused by Lasorda, his effectiveness faded before he turned 30. The new anchor of the pitching staff was a bespectacled string-bean of a right-hander named [[Orel Hershiser]]. He had been given the nickname "Bulldog" by Lasorda, more as a hopeful motivational tool than an objective description of his personality, but by 1988 he had matured into one of baseball's most effective pitchers. That year he won 23 games and the [[Cy Young Award]], and broke [[Don Drysdale]]'s major league record by tossing 59 consecutive scoreless innings, ending with a 10-inning [[shutout]] on his final start of the season.

====1988 World Series Championship Team====
The [[1988 World Series|1988 Championship]] is all the more magical for the fact that the Dodgers were hardly baseball's best team on paper. They enjoyed career years from several players, and were inspired by the fiery intensity of newcomer [[Kirk Gibson]] (the league's [[MLB Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player]] that year), as well as the quiet but steady Hershiser and the always ebullient Lasorda. Although they entered the [[National League Championship Series|NLCS]] as decided underdogs to the powerful [[New York Mets]], who they were 1-10 against during the regular season, the Dodgers prevailed in a thrilling back-and-forth series that went the entire 7 games. The [[1988 World Series|World Series]] matched them with an even more powerful opponent, the [[Oakland Athletics]], who owned baseball's best regular-season record with 104 wins against only 58 defeats. Featuring the "Bash Brothers" duo of [[Mark McGwire]] and [[Jos<U+00E9> Canseco]], the A's took an early lead in Game 1 on a [[grand slam (baseball)|grand slam]] by Canseco, and led 4-3 going into the bottom of the ninth inning. With two outs, pinch-hitter [[Mike Davis (baseball player)|Mike Davis]] drew a base on balls from formidable closer and future [[Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall of Famer]] [[Dennis Eckersley]]. During Davis' at-bat, Lasorda had the light-hitting infielder [[Dave Anderson]] on deck so the Athletics would pitch to Davis more carefully. Then, Gibson, hobbled by injuries to both his legs that included a broken ankle, came in to [[pinch hitter|pinch hit]]. After fighting off several pitches and working the count full, Gibson got the backdoor slider he was looking for and pulled it into the right field [[pavilion]] for a two-run, [[walk-off home run]], winning the game for the Dodgers, 5-4. Easily one of the most memorable and improbable home runs in baseball history, Gibson's dramatic home run was his only appearance of the entire series, and it set the tone for the following four games. Hershiser dominated the Athletics in Games 2 and 5, and was on the mound when the Dodgers completed their stunning 4 games to 1 upset of the A's, capping off an incredible personal season by being named the Series MVP. Few remember that the Dodgers were so injury riddled during their World Series appearance. They won the Series in Game 5 with lifetime reserves Danny Heep and Mickey Hatcher in the starting lineup.

===The 1990s: Rookies and the Fox Era===
<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:DS19 gagne3.jpg|thumb|Cy Young Award winner <U+00C9>ric Gagn<U+00E9>]] -->
After 1988, the Dodgers did not win another postseason game until 2004, though they did reach the playoffs in [[1995]] and [[1996]], narrowly missed in [[1991]] and [[1997]], and led the NL West when the end of the 1994 season was cancelled by a [[1994 Major League Baseball strike|strike]].  Hershiser, like Valenzuela before him, suffered an arm injury in 1990 due to overwork, which took the edge off his effectiveness for the remainder of his career.  From 1992 to 1996, five consecutive Dodgers were named [[MLB Rookie of the Year Award|Rookie of the Year]]:  [[Eric Karros]], [[Mike Piazza]], [[Ra<U+00FA>l Mondes<U+00ED>]], [[Hideo Nomo]], and [[Todd Hollandsworth]], which is a record. After nearly 20 years at the helm, Lasorda retired in 1996, though he still remains with the Dodgers as an executive vice-president. He was replaced as manager by longtime Dodgers shortstop [[Bill Russell (baseball)|Bill Russell]].  

Nearly a half-century of unusual stability (only two managers 1954-1996, owned by a single family 1950-1998) finally came to an end.  In 1998, the O'Malley family sold the Dodgers to [[Rupert Murdoch]]'s [[News Corporation]], owner of the [[Fox network]] and [[20th Century Fox]].  Among the new ownership's early moves were trading away popular catcher Piazza, and replacing Russell with celebrity manager [[Davey Johnson]].  Johnson's volatile tenure ended two years later, and he was followed as manager by [[Jim Tracy]].  To fans accustomed to the personal touch of the O'Malleys, the Fox corporate ownership often seemed clumsy and distracted.  Huge contracts were awarded to injury-prone pitchers [[Kevin Brown]] and [[Darren Dreifort]], unprofitably tying up money that could have improved the team in many other areas.  Fox made the first changes to the home uniform since the club moved from Brooklyn and introduced the team's first alternate jersey and cap, adding silver to the team's official colors (although they have rarely been used since).  The team became more steady on the field in the early 2000s, with four consecutive winning seasons under the leadership of manager Tracy, starting pitcher [[Chan Ho Park]], slugger [[Shawn Green]], third baseman [[Adri<U+00E1>n Beltr<U+00E9>]], and catcher [[Paul Lo Duca]].  The 2002 season was marked by the emergence of [[<U+00C9>ric Gagn<U+00E9>]] as one of baseball's top [[relief pitcher]]s.  Gagn<U+00E9> later won the [[Cy Young Award]] in 2003, converting all 55 of his save opportunities that year, and holding the league to a 1.20 [[Earned run average|ERA]] and striking out 137 batters in 82 1/3 innings.  Gagn<U+00E9> would later establish a new major league record for consecutive saves, with 84 saves spanning parts of the 2002, 2003 and 2004 seasons.

=== The Sabermetric Experiment ===
In [[2004]], the Dodgers were returned to family ownership, as News Corp sold the team to [[Boston]] real estate developer [[Frank McCourt (executive)|Frank McCourt]].  McCourt immediately hired [[Paul DePodesta]] as his new general manager, replacing [[Dan Evans]].  As an assistant general manager in Oakland under [[Billy Beane]], DePodesta favored a highly [[statistical]] approach to evaluating prospects and potential free-agents.  This [[sabermetric]] approach, widely publicized in the book ''[[Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game]]'' by [[Michael Lewis (author)|Michael Lewis]], led many to believe that new owner McCourt was unwilling to pay for high priced talent, and would thus reduce the Dodgers to a status similar to small-market teams such as Oakland.  With a team largely assembled by DePodesta's predecessors, and augmented by some acquisitions of his own, DePodesta saw the Dodgers near the top of the standings through much of [[2004]].  In an effort to put the team over the top that year, DePodesta pulled off a number mid-season trades, including sending away three key players (including popular team leader LoDuca), while obtaining several new players.  The Dodgers did manage to win the [[NL West]] in 2004, but bowed out quickly in four games in the Division Series to the eventual National League champion [[St. Louis Cardinals]].  

During the winter of 2004-05, the team parted ways with several more longtime players, including  Beltr<U+00E9> and Green.  Their replacements included starting pitcher [[Derek Lowe]], outfielder [[J. D. Drew]], and the run-producing second baseman [[Jeff Kent]].  DePodesta's radical overhaul did not bear fruit in [[2005]], as the Dodgers suffered from clubhouse strife and stifling injuries, finishing with their second-worst record in Los Angeles history.  Supporters of DePodesta note that many of the players he let go also had sub-par seasons elsewhere, but he was widely blamed for ignoring team "chemistry" and other intangible factors when evaluating talent.  The club also faced an overwhelming number of injuries that quickly scuttled the team's hopes of repeating as division champions.  Among them were Drew's broken wrist, All-Star shortstop [[Cesar Izturis]]'s injury that required [[Tommy John Surgery]], and closer Gagn<U+00E9>'s deteriorating elbow condition that would also require surgery and force him to miss much of the 2005 season.  Manager Jim Tracy also parted ways with the team at the end of the 2005 season, citing irreconcilable differences with DePodesta.  However, DePodesta himself was fired by McCourt less than a month later, with McCourt later citing DePodesta's lack of leadership and personal skills.  [[Ned Colletti]] was hired as the new Dodger GM on [[16 November]] [[2005]].

===Resurgence under Colletti and Little===
Newly hired [[Ned Colletti]] was responsible for a tangible change in attitude and guided the Dodgers' resurgence in the 2006 season. He hired former Red Sox manager [[Grady Little]] to lead the team and also traded oft-troubled [[Milton Bradley (baseball)|Milton Bradley]] for rookie phenom [[Andre Ethier]]. His off season acquisitions also included former Atlanta Brave shortstop [[Rafael Furcal]] and former Red Sox third baseman [[Bill Mueller]]. Coletti also signed former All-Star shortstop [[Nomar Garciaparra]], even though the team already had two other former All-Star shortstops (Furcal and the then-injured [[Cesar Izturis]]).  Garciaparra agreed to play first base and adjusted quite well in the field and remained productive at the plate, producing several key hits in Dodger victories.  

Due to the crowded infield, untimely injuries and several players' lack of production, the team was rebuilt during the season.  The flurry of trading saw Cesar Izturis go to the Chicago Cubs for [[Greg Maddux]] while Willy Aybar and Danys Baez went to Atlanta for [[Wilson Betemit]].  A series of rookies were called up and provided substantial everyday contributions.  Among them were catcher [[Russell Martin]], who won the starting catching job after being called up in May and starting pitcher [[Chad Billingsley]], who had several quality starts in August and September.  Ethier led the team in batting with a .308 batting average as the team's everyday left fielder through much of the season.  Rookie first baseman [[James Loney (baseball player)|James Loney]] hit very well in his short time with the team, tying Gil Hodges<U+2019> 56-year-old Dodgers record  with 9 RBIs in one game on 28 September.  Another key move was handing the closer's role to rookie (but Japanese League veteran) [[Takashi Saito]], where he flourished, notching 24 saves in 26 opportunities while posting a 2.07 ERA.

After a heated pennant race, in which the most memorable moment occurred when the Dodgers hit four consecutive home runs on 18 September to tie the score in the ninth inning and then won the game on a tenth-inning walk-off homer by Garciaparra, the Dodgers entered the 2006 playoffs in the National League's Wild Card spot, having tied the San Diego Padres for the division lead but having lost 13 of 18 head-to-head meetings with the Padres.  They were eventually swept, 3-0, by the [[New York Mets]] in the [[2006 National League Division Series]].

===2007 Season===

In 2007, the Los Angeles Dodgers sent three players ([[Brad Penny]], [[Takashi Saito]], and [[Russell Martin]]) to the all-star game, and at one point, the Dodgers had a record of 54-41, which was then the best record in the [[National League]].  After a hitting slump, the Dodgers fell to 60-59, and seven games out of first place in the [[National League West|N.L. West]].  The Dodgers were able to rebound however, and had a 79-69 record with three weeks left in the season.  At this point, the Dodgers trailed the [[San Diego Padres]] by 1 1/2 games in the wild card slot, and the [[Arizona Diamondbacks]] by 3 1/2 games.  However, the Dodgers lost 10 of their next 11 games, which eliminated the Dodgers from postseason play, and would finish the season with a disappointing 82-80 record. After the season, Little resigned as manager, citing personal reasons [http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=3087421].

===Team nickname===
Prior to the declaration of an official team nickname in 1933, sportswriters and fans applied a number of nicknames to the club.  Early names included the ''Brooks'' and the ''Bridegrooms'' (after several players married prior to the 1888 season).  When the [[streetcar]] lines were set up in Brooklyn, writers began calling the city and the team by the somewhat pejorative term ''Trolley Dodgers,'' which became shortened to ''Dodgers.''  Under manager [[Ned Hanlon (baseball)|Ned Hanlon]] (1899-1905), the team became known as the ''Superbas'', after a popular (though unrelated) acrobatic troupe at that time called "Hanlon's Superbas."  Under manager [[Wilbert Robinson]] (1914-1931), the team was known as the ''Robins,'' though newspapers used ''Robins'' and ''Dodgers'' interchangeably, often in the same game summary.  No nickname was acknowledged on team uniforms until 1933, when the word ''Dodgers'' finally appeared.  Prior to that, they had sported either the word "Brooklyn" or a stylized letter "B." 

===Vin Scully===
{{main|Vin Scully}}

[[Vin Scully]] began broadcasting for the then Brooklyn ball club during the 1950 season and is a beloved figure among the fans to this very day.  In 1976, he was selected by Dodgers fans as the Most Memorable Personality (on the field or off) of the team's history in L.A.  He is also a recipient of the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Baseball Hall of Fame]]'s [[Ford C. Frick Award]] for broadcasters (inducted in 1982).  In 2008, he will begin his 59th year with the team.

As noted above, [[Vin Scully]] has called Dodgers games since 1950.  His longtime partners were [[Jerry Doggett]] (1956-1987) and [[Ross Porter (American broadcaster)|Ross Porter]] (1977-2003).  Unlike the modern style in which multiple sportscasters have an on-air conversation (usually with one functioning as [[play-by-play|play-by-play announcer]] and the other(s) as [[color commentator]]), Scully and Doggett and Porter generally called games solo, trading with each other inning-by-inning.  Scully continues to call Dodgers games without a color commentator.  

When Doggett retired after the 1987 season, he was replaced by Hall-of-Fame Dodgers pitcher [[Don Drysdale]].  Drysdale died in his hotel room before a game in 1993, resulting in a very difficult broadcast for Scully and Porter, and was replaced by former Dodgers outfielder [[Rick Monday]]. Porter's tenure was terminated somewhat controversially after the 2003 season, after which the current format of play-by-play announcers and color commentators was installed, led by newcomer [[Charley Steiner]] as well as Scully and Monday.  

Today, Scully calls a limited schedule of games (all home games and road games in [[National League West|NL West]] ballparks) for both [[flagship]] [[radio station]] [[KABC (AM)|KABC]] and television outlets [[KCAL-TV|KCAL]] and [[FSN West/Prime Ticket|FSN Prime Ticket]].  Scully is [[simulcast]] for the first three innings of each of his appearances, then announces only for the TV audience.

If Scully is calling the game, [[Charley Steiner]] takes over play-by-play on radio beginning with the fourth inning, with [[Rick Monday]] as [[color commentator]].  If Scully is not calling the game, Steiner and [[Steve Lyons]] call the entire game on television while Monday (now as play-by-play) and [[Jerry Reuss]] do the same on radio.

The Dodgers also broadcast on radio in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and the play-by-play is handled by another [[Ford C. Frick Award]] winner, [[Jaime Jarrin]].  Jarrin has been with the Dodgers since [[1959 in baseball|1959]].  The color analyst for some games is [[Fernando Valenzuela]], for whom Jarrin once translated postgame interviews.  The Spanish-language flagship is [[KHJ (AM)|KHJ]].

In 2006 the Dodgers introduced an on demand channel on Time Warner Cable called "[[Dodgers on Demand]]", it is hosted by Tony Kinkela.

Since 1997, Robinson's #42 has been retired throughout Major League Baseball in honor of his breaking the color barrier in 1947. Robinson is the only major league baseball player to have this honor bestowed upon him. He spent his entire career with the Dodgers, who retired his number in 1972.

[[New York Yankees]] closer [[Mariano Rivera]] still wears number 42, however, as he is the only active player who wore the number before it was retired across all of Major League Baseball.

Koufax, Campanella, and Robinson were the first Dodgers to have their numbers retired. They were all retired in a ceremony at Dodger Stadium on June 4, 1972.

Gilliam died suddenly in 1978 at the age of 49. The Dodgers retired his number promptly after his death, making him the only non-Hall-of-Famer to have his number retired with the Dodgers.
