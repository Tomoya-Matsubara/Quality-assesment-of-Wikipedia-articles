==Business history==
{{main|Westinghouse Air Brake Company}}
This building contained the offices of the [[Westinghouse Air Brake Company]] for well over a century.<ref name="Vondas 2006" /> The company was originally established by [[George Westinghouse]] in 1869.<ref name=Bellis>{{Citation|title=Inventors: George Westinghouse|url=http://inventors.about.com/library/inventors/blwestinghouse.htm|author=Bellis, Mary|journal=About.com|accessdate=2011-03-09}}</ref> Westinghouse had developed many companies during this time of industrial growth at the beginning of the twentieth century. The Air Brake plant, that made for improved performance and increased speed on the nations railways, was moved to its new location in [[Wilmerding, Pennsylvania]] in 1889.<ref name="Wilmerding News">Life in Wilmerding, <U+201C>The Air Brake City<U+201D> the Ideal Hometown. ''Wilmerding News'', 2 September.4.</ref> Wilmerding is a small town about {{convert|14|mi}} outside of Pittsburgh which, at the time, was only inhabited by about 5,000 people. Socialism was strong in Wilmerding and it was a peaceful non-violent farming borough. It was thought to be <U+201C>The Ideal Town<U+201D> for the company because of its location right along the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] and its mainly blue collar inhabitants. The Air Brake Company employed 3,000 citizens from the surrounding Pittsburgh area, but its work force was composed almost entirely of individuals from Wilmerding. <ref name="Wilmerding News" /> 

The office buildings were used until the building was vacated in 1985.<ref name="nom" /> It was then donated to the [[American Production and Inventory Control Society]].<ref name="nom" /> The Westinghouse Air Brake Company merged with [[MotivePower Industries|MotivePower Industries Corporation]] in 1999 to form the [[Wabtec|Wabtec Corporation]] ({{NYSE|WAB}}). Wabtec still provides employment for more than 1,000 residents of the borough.<ref name="Vondas 2006" />
