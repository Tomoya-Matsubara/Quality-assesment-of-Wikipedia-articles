==Production==
===Conception===
The idea for the series first came from executive producer [[Joel Surnow]], who initially had the idea of a TV show with 24 episodes in a season.  Each episode would be an hour long, taking place over the course of a single day.<ref name="kieferdangerous14">{{cite book|last=Heard|first=Christopher |title=Kiefer Sutherland - Living Dangerously|editor=Timothy Niedermann|publisher=Transit Publishing Inc.|date=2009|edition=1|page=14|isbn=78-1-926745-55-8}}</ref> He discussed the idea over the phone with producer [[Robert Cochran (TV producer)|Robert Cochran]], whose initial response was "Forget it, that's the worst idea I've ever heard, it will never work and it's too hard".<ref name="genesis">{{cite video|people=[[Joel Surnow]] and [[Robert Cochran (TV producer)|Robert Cochran]] (co-creators)|title=24: The Complete First Season (Special Edition) <U+2013> "The Genesis of 24"|medium=DVD|date=May 20, 2008|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> They met the next day at the [[International House of Pancakes]] in [[Woodland Hills, Los Angeles]], to discuss the idea of this  action-espionage series that used the format of real time to create dramatic tension with a race against the clock.<ref name=kieferdangerous14/>

===Design===
====Split screens====
[[File:24 Split Screen.jpg|thumb|right|250px|An example of a ''24'' split screen with the running clock, from the season 7 finale|alt=A split screen image from the TV series 24. In the image, it shows several different people, in different locations, depicted at the same time. This is used to show the viewer what different characters are doing at the same time]]
The idea of split screens was born out of the the amount of phone calls there were, and because of the element of real time, was used to trace parallel adventures of different characters, and aid in connecting them. the connecting of characters. It was used by producers to point the audience to where to pay attention, as secondary stories often take place outside of the main plot. The idea of using boxes came later which made shooting more flexible, as the shot could be cropped and reshaped inside the box. It was from here that the idea of using split screens as an artistic element in the series.<ref name="genesis"/>

====Running clock====
The idea of the running clock initially came from Joel Surnow, who wanted the audience to always know what time it was in the shows fictional timeline. This was done by an on-screen digital clock which appears before and after commercial breaks, and a smaller, silent clock also appears at other points in the narrative. The time shown is the [[in-universe]] time of the story.<ref name="genesis"/> When the running clock is shown, an alternating beeping noise for each second can usually be heard. This ticking is absent on rare occasions in the series, such as following the death of a major character or after a disastrous event.<ref name="ontheset">{{Cite episode |title=On the Record, On the Set of 24|network=Fox News|airdate=November 1, 2006}}</ref>

====Real time====
The concept of real time started when producer Joel Surnow thought of the idea of doing 24 episodes in a season, which each episode lasting an hour. They decided that the idea of real time had to make the show a "race against the clock".<ref name="genesis"/> Each episode takes place over the course of one hour, with time continuing to elapse during the commercial breaks. The exact amount of time is denoted by the digital clock display at the beginning and end of each segment. Mundane events, such as travel, sometimes occur during commercial breaks and thus these events are largely unseen.<ref name="Hanks&nbsp;<U+2014> Jack Back">{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/features/jacks-back-the-clock-ticks-for-24s-antihero-1027348.html|title=Jack's back: The clock ticks for 24's antihero|last=Hanks|first=Robert|publisher=Independent News & Media Limited|date=November 21, 2008|accessdate=July 31, 2009}}</ref> The story time correlates with elapsed viewing time if episodes are broadcast with commercial breaks of set duration inserted at the points prescribed by the episode.<ref name="genesis"/>

In line with the depiction of events in real time, ''24'' does not use [[slow motion]] techniques. The series also does not use flashbacks, except once during the first season finale. Watched continuously without advertisements, each season would run approximately 17 hours.<ref name="Hanks&nbsp;<U+2014> Jack Back" />

===Setting===
The first six seasons of the show were mostly based in Los Angeles and nearby California locations<U+2014>both real and fictional.<ref name="Ticonderoga"/> Other locations have also been featured, such as Washington, D.C., for parts of the fourth, sixth, and seventh seasons. The eighth season took place in New York City,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://tv.nytimes.com/2010/01/15/arts/television/15twentyfour.html|title=Another Terrorist Plot, Another Very Long Day|first=Alessandra|last=Stanley|work=The New York Times|date=January 15, 2010|accessdate=March 27, 2010}}</ref> and the TV movie ''Redemption'', filmed in [[South Africa]], was set mainly in the fictional African nation of Sangala.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/821/821061p1.html|title=IGN: 24: The Dead Rise|publisher=IGN|first=Eric|last=Goldman|date=September 19, 2007|accessdate=April 23, 2008}}</ref>

The main setting of the show is the fictional Counter Terrorist Unit. Its office consists of two main departments: Field Operations, which involves confronting and apprehending suspects, and Communications, which gathers intelligence and assists those that work in Field Operations. CTU offices are established in various cities with these units reporting to "Divisions", and Divisions reporting to the "District". While CTU itself is a fictional agency, several entities with similar names or duties, like the [[National Counterterrorism Center]], have emerged since the show's debut on television.<ref name="ante">{{cite web|url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/28525607|title=24 ups the ante in Washington, D.C. |date=June 1, 2009|publisher=MSNBC.com|accessdate=July 3, 2011}}</ref>

The set of CTU was initially filmed in a Fox Sports office, with the set recreated in old pencil factory in [[Chatsworth, Los Angeles|Chatsworth]]. The same set was used for the first three seasons, but was redesigned before the start of the fourth season, and again before the start of the eight season. Other sets were also constructed here, such as [[Charles Logan (24 character)|Charles Logan's]] presidential retreat shown in seasons five and six, and the [[White House]] bunker shown in season six.<ref name="Ticonderoga"/>

===Series conclusion===
On March 26, 2010, a statement was issued from [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] which explained that season eight would conclude ''24''s run on television. [[Kiefer Sutherland]] gave a statement:

{{cquote|This has been the role of a lifetime, and I will never be able to fully express my appreciation to everyone who made it possible. While the end of the series is bittersweet, we always wanted ''24'' to finish on a high note, so the decision to make the eighth season our last was one we all agreed upon. This feels like the culmination of all our efforts from the writers to the actors to our fantastic crew and everyone at Fox. Looking ahead to the future, Howard Gordon and I are excited about the opportunity to create the feature film version of ''24''. But when all is said and done, it is the loyal worldwide fan base that made it possible for me to have the experience of playing the role of Jack Bauer, and for that I am eternally grateful.<ref name="press release"/>}}

Executive producer and showrunner [[Howard Gordon]] was also a part of the decision. He was quoted saying:

{{cquote|Kiefer and I have loved every minute of making ''24'', but we all believe that now is the right time to call it a day. I echo his sentiments of gratitude toward the show<U+2019>s amazing creative team, as well as the studio and network who have always believed in us and shown us unbelievable support.}}

Peter Rice, Chairman of Entertainment at Fox Networks Group said, "''24'' is so much more than just a TV show&nbsp;<U+2013> it has redefined the drama genre and created one of the most admired action icons in television history." Kevin Reilly, President of Entertainment at Fox Broadcasting Company added, "We are extremely proud of this groundbreaking series and will be forever thankful to Kiefer, the producers, the cast and crew for everything they<U+2019>ve put into ''24'' over the years. It<U+2019>s truly been an amazing and unforgettable eight days.<ref name="press release">{{cite press release|publisher=Fox Broadcasting Company|title="24: Day Eight" Will Be the Award-Winning Series' Final Season|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news.aspx?id=20100326fox02|date=March 26, 2010|accessdate=March 27, 2010}}</ref>

===Relation to other productions===
Immediately prior to ''24'', series co-creators [[Joel Surnow]] and [[Robert Cochran (TV producer)|Robert Cochran]] executive-produced ''[[La Femme Nikita (TV series)|La Femme Nikita]]'' for its entire five-year run on [[USA Network]]. Both series deal with anti-terrorist operations, and the lead characters of both series are placed in situations where they must make a tragic choice in order to serve the greater good. There are numerous on- and off-screen creative connections between ''24'' and ''La Femme Nikita''. Several actors from ''La Femme Nikita'' have portrayed similar roles on ''24'', a number of story concepts from ''La Femme Nikita'' have been revisited on ''24'', and many of the creative personnel from ''La Femme Nikita'' worked on ''24'' in their same role.<ref name="byebauer">{{cite web|url=http://www.thestar.com/entertainment/television/article/813094--goodbye-mr-bauer|title=Goodbye, Mr. Bauer|last=Brioux|first=Bill|date=May 22, 2010|work=The Star|accessdate=June 3, 2011}}</ref><ref name="timeoflives">{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1001184,00.html|title=Television: The Time Of Their Lives|last=McDowell|first=Jeane|date=November 12, 2001|work=Time|accessdate=June 3, 2011}}</ref><ref name="onmind">{{cite web|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/television/2003598190_loceff05.html|title="24"/ 7  Seattle-area TV writer always has Jack Bauer on his mind|last=Krug|first=Kurt Anthony|date=March 5, 2007|work=The Seattle Times|accessdate=June 3, 2011}}</ref>

Similar to the 1997 film, ''[[Air Force One (film)|Air Force One]]'', ''24'' featured the president's personal jumbo-jet ([[Air Force One]]).  Air Force One was featured in ''24'' seasons 2 and 4. [[Air Force Two]] (carrying the Vice President but not the President) was featured in season 6. Several actors featured in ''24'', such as [[Xander Berkeley]], [[Glenn Morshower]], [[Wendy Crewson]], [[Timothy Carhart]], [[J<U+00FC>rgen Prochnow]], [[Tom Everett]] and [[Spencer Garrett]] also appeared in the film ''Air Force One''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/search/name?roles=tt0285331,tt0118571|title=Most Popular People Credited in "24 (2001 TV Series)" And Credited in "Air Force One (1997)"|publisher=IMDb|accessdate=May 30, 2011}}</ref> The [[Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|25th amendment]], which deals with succession to the Presidency and establishes procedures for filling a vacancy in the office of the Vice President and responding to Presidential disabilities, was also a shared theme between the film and the television series.

===Ratings===
Seasonal rankings were based on average total viewers per episode of ''24'' on Fox. Most U.S. network television seasons start in mid-September and end in late May, which coincides with the completion of May [[sweeps]]. ''24'' aired during both February and May sweeps.  After season 3, however, '' 24 ''began its season in January and ran new episodes non-stop until May. Two new episodes were often shown on the same night, and the entire season took considerably less than 24 weeks to air.

Viewership increased midway through the show's second season when the mega-hit ''[[American Idol]]'' became the lead-in to ''24'' beginning in February 2003. For its fourth season, Fox gave the show a vote of confidence by moving ''24'' out of the post-''American Idol'' time slot (to make room for the eventual hit drama, ''[[House (TV series)|House]]'') and placed it on Monday nights at 9:00 pm Eastern while it aired the show on consecutive weeks, [[Midseason replacement|beginning in mid-January]] of 2005. The consecutive-week schedule was also implemented for 2006, beginning in mid-January 2006.

Powerful and involving, with characters who are more fully realized with each season, the show still has viewers on the edge of their seats, both riveted to the action and begging, pleading for a modicum of relief. |Judges of the [[American Film Institute]] on the show's inclusion in the [[American Film Institute Awards 2005|2005 list.]]<ref name="topten"/>}}

===Home media===
The release of ''24'' on DVD had a significant impact on the success of the television series. In an interview with [[IGN]] in 2002, Sutherland revealed, "[''24'''s] success in [the UK] was phenomenal. It was the biggest show the BBC has ever had. It was the number one DVD there, knocking off ''[[The Lord of the Rings film trilogy|Lord of the Rings]]'', which is unheard of for a television show DVD to actually knock-out every feature DVD available. And that's because they showed it without commercials."<ref>{{cite web|first=Steve|last=Head|title=A Conversation with Kiefer Sutherland|publisher=IGN|date=October 28, 2002|url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/375/375598p1.html|accessdate=June 3, 2011}}</ref> The U.S. sales of the season one DVDs increased the audience size of season two by 25%.<ref>{{cite web|first=David|last=Lambert|title=24's TV-on-DVD success leads to new DVD concepts|publisher=TVShowsOnDVD|date=October 22, 2003|url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/24/764|accessdate=June 3, 2011}}</ref>
