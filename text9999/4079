The ''[[Tokyo Mew Mew]]'' [[manga]] and [[anime]] series features a cast of characters designed by [[Mia Ikumi]]. The series takes place in a fictional version of Tokyo, Japan, where five adolescent girls, called Mew Mews, are infused with the DNA of endangered species to combat aliens attempting to take over the Earth. The manga series is followed by a short sequel series, ''Tokyo Mew Mew a la Mode'', which introduces a new Mew Mew and a new threat.

The Mew Mews are led by the main character, [[#Ichigo Momomiya|Ichigo Momomiya]], whose first task is to gather the other four Mew Mews: [[#Mint Aizawa|Mint Aizawa]], [[#Lettuce Midorikawa|Lettuce Midorikawa]], [[#Pudding Fong|Pudding Fong]], and [[#Zakuro Fujiwara|Zakuro Fujiwara]]. As the series progresses, Ichigo goes from having a crush on [[#Masaya Aoyama|Masaya Aoyama]] to becoming his girlfriend while trying to hide her secret double life from him. The series antagonists include three aliens, [[#Kish|Kish]], [[#Pie|Pie]], and [[#Tart|Tart]], and their leader, [[#Deep Blue|Deep Blue]]. Originally from Earth, the aliens were forced to leave long ago due to deadly environmental changes. They have returned to kill the humans, who they feel are destroying their planet, and reclaim the planet. In ''a la Mode'', [[middle school]] student [[#Berry Shirayuki|Berry Shirayuki]] is introduced as the sixth Mew Mew and, in the absence of Ichigo, the temporary leader of the Mew Mews. ''A la Mode'' also introduces new set of antagonists, the [[#Saint Rose Crusaders|Saint Rose Crusaders]], a group of human teenagers with various [[psychic]] abilities with a desire to create their own utopia. Led by [[#Duke|Duke]], they make several attempts to kill Berry, eventually turning the local populace against the Mew Mews.

Ikumi's initial vision for ''Tokyo Mew Mew'' was a story called ''Tokyo Black Cat Girl'' that featured a cat-girl battling alien invaders. After the story was transitioned to a more upbeat story of five female superheroes, the character designs were redone to have a lighter, more colorful feel. The main series characters were praised for being a perfect fit for the overall story, as well as for their cute appearances. The characters introduced in ''a la Mode'' were also praised for their visual appearances, but criticized as being repeats of the original series. The character Duke was also criticized for having a design reminiscent of the [[white supremacy]] group, the [[Ku Klux Klan]].

==Creation and conception==
[[Mia Ikumi]] spent a year designing the ''Tokyo Mew Mew'' [[manga]] before the release of the first volume in February 2001.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ikumi |first=Mia  |authorlink=Mia Ikumi |coauthors=[[Reiko Yoshida|Yoshida, Reiko]] |title=Tokyo Mew Mew, Volume 1 |date=April 8, 2003 |publisher=[[Tokyopop]] |isbn=978-1-59182-236-3 |page=125}}</ref> The story she originally presented to her editors, ''Tokyo Black Cat Girl'', featured a heroine named Princess Azumi who is given the ability to transform into a cat-girl by an intergalactic police officer named Masha. He then asks her to aid him in defeating alien invaders called the Baku using her new powers. Azumi agrees, while trying to keep her new double life secret from her crush.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ikumi |first=Mia  |authorlink=Mia Ikumi |title=Tokyo Mew Mew, Volume 4 |date=October 14, 2003 |publisher=[[Tokyopop]] |isbn=978-1-59182-239-4 |chapter=Tokyo Black Cat Girl |pages=136<U+2013>186}}</ref> After the production team decided to focus on five female superheroes, Ikumi was asked to reconstruct the lead character and the darker Princess Azumi was changed into the brighter and more colorful Ichigo. She had reservations about the changes, as the character was originally designed for a more dramatic series.<ref name="Vol 1 p172<U+2013>173">{{cite book |last=Ikumi |first=Mia  |authorlink=Mia Ikumi |coauthors=[[Reiko Yoshida|Yoshida, Reiko]] |title=Tokyo Mew Mew, Volume 1 |date=April 8, 2003 |publisher=[[Tokyopop]] |isbn=978-1-59182-236-3 |pages=172<U+2013>173}}</ref>

Ikumi created other girl<U+2013>animal combinations while designing the four other Mew Mews, including a mouse girl with the same green coloring as Lettuce. However, the mouse design was one of several designs rejected for use in the series as the choices were narrowed down.<ref name="Vol 1 p172<U+2013>173" /> Once the main Mew Mew designs were finalized, Ikumi named them after various foods: Ichigo (Strawberry), Mint, Lettuce, Pudding, and Zakuro (Pomegranate). During one of the project meetings, an unnamed editor remarked that the names might be hard to remember and suggested naming the characters after various colors instead, but the food names were kept.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ikumi |first=Mia  |authorlink=Mia Ikumi |coauthors=[[Reiko Yoshida|Yoshida, Reiko]] |title=Tokyo Mew Mew, Volume 1 |date=April 8, 2003 |publisher=[[Tokyopop]] |isbn=978-1-59182-236-3 |pages=73}}</ref> Although Ikumi initially suggested calling Ichigo's main attack "Strawberry Bell Bell" as a joke, the editorial team thought it was funny and kept the name. Ikumi noted that future attack names were decided by which sounded funniest.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ikumi |first=Mia |authorlink=Mia Ikumi |coauthors=[[Reiko Yoshida|Yoshida, Reiko]] |title=Tokyo Mew Mew, Volume 2 |date=June 17, 2003 |publisher=[[Tokyopop]] |isbn=978-1-59182-237-0 |page=116 }}</ref> The only character from Ikumi's ''Tokyo Black Cat Girl'' to retain his original name and general appearance was Masha, but his gender was changed to female in ''Tokyo Mew Mew''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ikumi |first=Mia |authorlink=Mia Ikumi |title=Tokyo Mew Mew, Volume 4 |date=October 14, 2003 |publisher=[[Tokyopop]] |isbn=978-1-59182-239-4 |chapter=Tokyo Black Cat Girl |pages=136<U+2013>186}}</ref>

Mari Kitayama adapted the character designs from Ikumi's original artwork for the anime adaptation. Ikumi stated that she approved of the character designs, and agreed with the voice actor selections.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ikumi |first=Mia |authorlink=Mia Ikumi |coauthors=[[Reiko Yoshida|Yoshida, Reiko]] |title=Tokyo Mew Mew, Volume 4 |date=October 14, 2003 |publisher=[[Tokyopop]] |isbn=978-1-59182-239-4 |page=44}}</ref><!-- a passing note in the manga while discussion; from industry standards, Ikumi likely had little say in them -->

==Mew Mews==
The Mew Mews are young girls who have been injected with the genes of [[endangered species]], giving them the ability to transform into Mew Mews. The project chose endangered species because they felt that these species would have the strongest desire to preserve their kind. The superheroes are biological weapons tasked with fighting the [[#Chimera anima|chimera anima]], the monsters created when alien [[parasite]]s infect a living host. They are later called on to fight the aliens that were the source of the chimera anima invasion. The creation of the first five Mew Mews occurred accidentally; the head of the project, [[#Ryou Shirogane|Ryou Shirogane]], originally intended to inject a chimera anima with the endangered animal genes directly, to see if that would reverse the affects of the infection.{{#tag:ref|{{cite book |last=Ikumi |first=Mia  |authorlink=Mia Ikumi |coauthors=[[Reiko Yoshida|Yoshida, Reiko]] |title=Tokyo Mew Mew, Volume 1 |date=April 8, 2003 |publisher=[[Tokyopop]] |isbn=978-1-59182-236-3 |chapter=Chapters 1<U+2013>4: In the Beginning |pages=6<U+2013>169}}<ref name="ChapterNote" group="n">In the English language release of the first volume of the ''Tokyo Mew Mew'' manga series, Tokyopop combined chapters 1<U+2013>4, unnamed in the original Japanese release, into a single chapter, named "In the Beginning".</ref>|name=In the Beginning}}<!-- ref within a ref -->

The Mew Project was started by Ryou's father, Dr. Shirogane, five years before ''Tokyo Mew Mew'' is set. The manga never explains why the project was started or how they knew about chimera animas and the aliens, but Dr. Shirogane does mention that they must learn how to inject animal genes into human DNA in order to fight the aliens.<ref name="Chapter 21" /> In the anime adaptation, Dr. Shirogane discovered the fossilized remains of an ancient [[civilization]], called the Chimera, during an archaeological dig and began researching the race of people who lived there, with his assistant [[#Keiichiro Akasaka|Keiichiro Akasaka]]. This would eventually become the Mew Project.<ref name="Ep36">{{cite episode |title=Shirogane's Past: the Secret of the Mew Mews' Birth! |episodelink=List of Tokyo Mew Mew episodes |series=Tokyo Mew Mew |serieslink=Tokyo Mew Mew |number=36 |airdate=December 7, 2002 }}</ref> A laboratory explosion kills Dr. Shirogane and his wife, leaving then 10-year-old Ryou orphaned.

The group comprises four teenagers and their leader Duke. In a flashback to the group's founding, Royal Highness, Happy Child, Blue Bayou and Sweet Juliet are said to have been born with varying special powers which resulted in their being shunned by other people and their families abandoning them by sending them away to a [[boarding school]] where they met. Discovering their commonality, they devise a plot to blow up the school, but a mysterious person, known only as "Duke", convinces them not to waste their lives because they were necessary to the world.<ref name="TMM Chapter 6" />

The Saint Rose Crusaders seeks to reshape the "boring grownup world" into their own [[utopia]] by using their "intelligence, philanthropy, and elegance".<ref name="TMM Chapter 1" /> To do this they use the chimera anima left behind by the aliens after the events in ''Tokyo Mew Mew'', but when the Mew Mews continue to defeat the remaining alien parasites, the Saint Rose Crusaders attention shifts to the Mew Mews' new leader, Berry Shirayuki.<ref name="TMM Chapter 2" /><ref name="TMM Chapter 3">{{cite book |last=Ikumi |first=Mia |authorlink=Mia Ikumi |title=Tokyo Mew Mew a la Mode, Volume 1 |date=June 7, 2005 |publisher=[[Tokyopop]] |isbn=978-1-59532-789-5 |chapter=Chapter 3 |pages=68<U+2013>100}}</ref> When their plans to capture and kill Berry Shirayuki is foiled by the other Mews, including the returned Mew Ichigo, the Saint Rose Crusaders use subliminal messages and hypnotism to turn the citizens of Tokyo including Berry's best friend, and growing crush, Tasuku Meguro, against the Mew Mews.<ref name="TMM Chapter 10">{{cite book |last=Ikumi |first=Mia |authorlink=Mia Ikumi |title=Tokyo Mew Mew a la Mode, Volume 2 |date=December 8, 2006 |publisher=[[Tokyopop]] |isbn=978-1-59532-790-1 |chapter=Chapter 10 |pages=103<U+2013>133}}</ref><ref name="TMM Chapter 8">{{cite book |last=Ikumi |first=Mia |authorlink=Mia Ikumi |title=Tokyo Mew Mew a la Mode, Volume 2 |date=December 8, 2006 |publisher=[[Tokyopop]] |isbn=978-1-59532-790-1 |chapter=Chapter 8 |pages=39<U+2013>69}}</ref><ref name="TMM Chapter 9">{{cite book |last=Ikumi |first=Mia |authorlink=Mia Ikumi |title=Tokyo Mew Mew a la Mode, Volume 2 |date=December 8, 2006 |publisher=[[Tokyopop]] |isbn=978-1-59532-790-1 |chapter=Chapter 9 |pages=70<U+2013>101}}</ref>

Each of the Crusaders features in a single major attack against Mew Berry or the other Mew Mews, before fading into the background. Towards the end of the series, Mew Berry breaks the brainwashing spell on the public and Tasuku, and Duke admits that the methods the Crusaders used were wrong. They are last seen in the series standing together on the roof of a building, enjoying the warm feelings being spread by Mew Berry.<ref name="TMM Chapter 10" />

====Duke====
The leader of the Saint Rose Crusaders, {{nihongo|Duke|<U+516C><U+7235>|Dy<U+016B>ku}} is never clearly identified within the series as being male or female but it is left to the readers to decide due to the ambiguous character designed used.

He is presented as being somewhat vain about his appearance, referring to his own face as beautiful when it is scratched, and another character, Happy Child, says that Royal Highness angers very easily.<ref name="TMM Chapter 4" /> Royal Highness is seen displaying powers of [[telekinesis]] in flashback sequences, though he does not use them within the main story.<ref name="TMM Chapter 6" /> During the series, he is shown to be capable of mass [[hypnosis]] and as having a thirst for blood.<ref name="TMM Chapter 4" /> His primarily appearance in ''a La Mode'' is to commence the first attack on Mew Berry by posing as a special lecturer, {{nihongo|Yuzen Akizuki|<U+79CB><U+6708> <U+53CB><U+7985>|Akizuki Yuuzen}}.<ref name="TMM Chapter 4" /><ref name="TMM Chapter 3" />

====Happy Child====
Happy Child first shows himself to the Mew Mews when he retrieves Royal Highness. He makes his main appearance during the second attack on Mew Berry. Happy Child is able to teleport himself, float in mid-air, speak directly into other people's minds, and attack with ultra-sonic waves.<ref name="TMM Chapter 4" /> In the flashback where the Crusaders first met Duke, Happy Child attempts to commit [[suicide]] by jumping off the roof.

==Reception==
The characters of ''Tokyo Mew Mew'' have received praise from several publications for anime, manga, and other media. ''Anime Fringe''{{'s}} Patrick King praised Ikumi's character designs for being a perfect first for the feel of the series, noting that "one of the most attractive aspects of Tokyo Mew Mew is easily Mia Ikumi's ultra-cute artwork. Big eyes, cat ears, fuzzy tails, and short skirts all come together in a cuteness combo that's hard to resist."<ref name="KingReview">{{cite web |url=http://www.animefringe.com/magazine/2003/06/reviews/11/ |title=Tokyo Mew Mew Vol.2 |first=Patrick |last=King |publisher=Animefringe |year=2003 |month=June |accessdate=April 18, 2008 }}</ref> In ''[[Manga: The Complete Guide]]'', [[Shaenon Garrity]] referred to the Mew Mews as "cute girls in animal-themed lingerie".<ref name="MangaGuide">{{cite book |last=Thompson |first=Jason |title=[[Manga: The Complete Guide]] |date=October 9, 2007 |publisher=[[Del Rey Books]] |location=New York, New York |isbn=978-0-345-48590-8 |oclc=85833345 |page=369 }}</ref>

The new characters introduced in ''Tokyo Mew Mew a La Mode'' received more mixed reviews. Mania Entertainment's Mike Dungan found new Mew Mew Berry Shirayuki to be a "fun character" due to her energy and cheerfulness. He also found Tasuku to be a well-crafted complement, considering him "an excellent complement to <nowiki>[Berry]</nowiki>" and noting that his "outgoing charm and clinginess&nbsp;... is surprisingly never annoying."<ref name="Aod La Mode 1">{{cite web | url=http://www.mania.com/tokyo-mew-mew-la-mode-vol01_article_82011.html | title=Tokyo Mew Mew a la Mode Vol. #01 |first=Mike |last=Dungan |publisher=Mania Entertainment |date=November 7, 2005 | accessdate=April 5, 2008 }}</ref> However, Janet Crocker of ''Anime Fringe'' felt Berry was an overly shallow heroine that just mirrored the life Mew Ichigo (from the original ''Tokyo Mew Mew'') in a shorter form and she dismissed the Saint Rose Crusaders' costumes and plans as being nothing more than concepts borrowed from ''Sailor Moon''. She also criticized the specific design used for the character Duke, whose white robe she felt was too similar to those used by the [[white supremacy]] group, the [[Ku Klux Klan]].<ref name="CrockerReview"/> [[Anime News Network]]'s Carlo Santos notes that "Berry has the potential to become insufferable", but felt she acted more like a "typical preteen girl" who was "sweet" and "silly" but "stop[s] right before it gets annoying", thus avoiding being a standard "marketable character trying to rack up charm points."<ref name="SantosReview">{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/tokyo-mew-mew-a-la-mode-gn-1 |title=Tokyo Mew Mew a la Mode GN 1 |first=Carlo |last=Santos |publisher=[[Anime News Network]] |date=July 18, 2005 |accessdate=April 18, 2008 }}</ref>
