==History==
The [[San Diego Brewing Company]] opened in 1896 as the first commercial brewery in San Diego County. At the time it was the largest manufacturing enterprise in the county. It was located on 32nd street in San Diego. It closed in 1920 because of [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]]. It reopened in 1935 and continued in operation until 1942, when it was displaced by the [[U.S. Navy]]'s [[Naval Base San Diego|32nd Street Naval Station]]. A brewpub by the same name now operates in [[Mission Valley, San Diego|Mission Valley]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sandiegobrewing.com/about-us/who-we-are|title=Who we are|work=San Diego Brewing Company|accessdate=17 June 2013}}</ref> 

[[File:Mission Brewery Southeast Northeast Facades.jpg|thumb|left|The old [[Mission Brewery]] building in San Diego, California]]
[[Mission Brewery]], located in the [[Midway, San Diego|Middletown]] neighborhood of San Diego, opened in 1913 and closed due to Prohibition. It was never reopened as a brewery, but the landmark five-story brick building was repurposed several times, for kelp extraction until the 1980s and ultimately as an office building, still in operation. The building was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places listings in San Diego County, California|National Register of Historic Places]] in 1989.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WMAJAT_Mission_Brewery_San_Diego_California|title=Mission Brewery - San Diego, California|work=waymarking.com|accessdate=17 June 2013}}</ref> The name Mission Brewery was revived in 2007 by a brewery at 14th and L Streets in [[Downtown San Diego]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://missionbrewery.com/?age=passed|title=Welcome to Mission Brewery!|work=Mission Brewery|accessdate=17 June 2013}}</ref>

The [[Aztec Brewing Company]], founded in [[Mexicali]] in 1921, moved to San Diego in 1933 following the repeal of Prohibition. It closed in 1953 after being purchased by [[National Brewing Company]]. For the next 36 years there was no local commercially brewed beer in San Diego County. The name Aztec Brewing Company has been revived in a [[Vista, California|Vista]] brewery which opened in 2011.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://threebzine.com/?p=709|title=Breathing New Life <U+2013> Aztec Brewing Company Rises Again In San Diego|date=April 24, 2012|work=ThreeBZine|accessdate=17 June 2013}}</ref>

During Prohibition (1920&ndash;1933), San Diegans could still drink beer by crossing the border into [[Mexico]]. In the formerly small town of [[Tijuana]] more than 180 cantinas were built to serve American visitors, and the city's population grew tenfold between 1920 and 1930. Several modern breweries were built in Mexicali to supply the demand.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sandiegohistory.org/sdbeerhistory|title=San Diego Brews|work=San Diego History Center|accessdate=17 June 2014}}</ref> 

Before Prohibition there had been seven breweries in San Diego. After repeal there were three: Aztec Brewing Company, San Diego Brewing Company, and Balboa Brewing Company. These were soon either purchased by the Big Three national brewing companies (Anheuser-Busch, Coors, and Miller) or driven out of business by the aggressive marketing practices of the Big Three.<ref name = "Liwag" /> From 1953 until the 1980s the local beer market was dominated by the large national brewers, with the alternative being imported beer from Mexico. But changes in national and state law in the late 1970s made home brewing legal, and in 1982 California allowed breweries to operate restaurants on their premises, which made [[brewpub]]s possible.<ref name = "Liwag">{{cite journal|last=Liwag|first=Ernie|title=Craft Beer in San Diego Society|journal=Journal of San Diego History|pages=24<U+2013>36|url=https://www.sandiegohistory.org/journal/v53-1/pdf/2007-1_beer.pdf}}</ref> 

[[File:Karl Strauss Carlsbad.jpg|The Karl Strauss brewpub in Carlsbad|thumb|right]]
In 1989 the [[Karl Strauss Brewing Company]] opened a brewery and brewpub on Columbia Street in [[Downtown San Diego]] and expanded into distribution brewing in 1991. This was the first commercial brewery in San Diego since 1953, and for many San Diego consumers it was their first exposure to freshly brewed beer and to styles such as [[amber lager]] and [[pale ale]].<ref name = "rising" /> In the mid-1990s a second, more adventurous wave of craft breweries appeared, led by [[Pizza Port]], Stone and Alesmith.<ref name = "SDMag" /> The local craft beer movement was inspired in part by [[homebrewing]] hobbyists, supported by the storefront Home Brew Mart, which opened in 1992 and later spun off the [[Ballast Point Brewing Company]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Beer lovers learn to brew-it-yourself|date=September 12, 1999|work=San Diego Union Tribune}}</ref> 

Beer festivals like the Real Ale Festival, launched in 1997 by Tomme Arthur and Tom Nickel, promoted the new styles and educated a new generation of beer drinkers.<ref name = "rocked" /> By 2004 San Diego was so well established in the brewing world that the biennial [[World Beer Cup]] competition was held there; 11 medals went to locals.<ref name = "rocked" /> San Diego hosted the event again in 2008, taking 14 medals, and in 2012, taking 16 medals.<ref name="Beer Cup 2012">{{cite news|url=http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2012/may/06/world-beer-cup-stresses-its-international-scope-wh/|title=Local brewers take 16 medals in World Beer Cup|last=Rowe|first=Peter|date=May 6, 2012|work=San Diego Union Tribune|accessdate=18 June 2013}}</ref> The "Best Small Brewer" Award has gone to San Diego County brewers three times: 2004 (Nickel for Oggi's Pizza), 2008 (Arthur for [[Lost Abbey]]/[[Port Brewing Company]]), and 2010 (Ballast Point brewers).

==Economic impact==
Brewing has been one of the fastest-growing business sectors in San Diego, with seven new licenses issued in 2010, fifteen in 2011 and eighteen in 2012.<ref name = "nu" /> In 2011 the county's brewers and brew pubs generated $300 million in direct economic impact to the county, making $600 million in sales and generating or sustaining 2,800 jobs.<ref name="nu">{{cite web|url=http://www.nusinstitute.org/assets/resources/pageResources/NUSIPR_SD_Craft_Breweries_Econ_Impact_Brief.pdf|title=The Economic Impact of Craft Breweries in San Diego|work=National University System Institute for Policy Researech|accessdate=18 June 2013}}</ref> In addition, beer-related tourism is an important part of San Diego County's visitor industry throughout the year;<ref name = "nu" /> the county is described as a "beer city destination".<ref name = "rising" /> Many breweries offer tours of their facilities and tasting rooms, and dozens of commercial tour operators market "beer tours" in San Diego County.

San Diego Beer Week, launched in 2009, is now a ten-day county-wide festival, held in early November and aimed at both local residents and tourists.
