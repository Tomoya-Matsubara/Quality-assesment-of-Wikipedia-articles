The '''MV ''Horizon-1''''' is a [[bulk cargo|dry bulk cargo]] [[cargo ship|ship]] owned and operated by the [[Istanbul]] based [[Turkey|Turkish]] company Horizon Denizcilik <U+0130><U+00E7> ve D<U+0131><U+015F> Ticaret A.<U+015E>. (Horizon Maritime Trading Co.).

On July 8, 2009, the ship was captured by [[Piracy in Somalia|Somali pirates]] in the [[Gulf of Aden]]. At the time of the seizure, the ''Horizon-1''{{'}}s crew  consisted of 23 Turks including a female [[third mate|third officer]].<ref name="h<U+00FC>r0710">{{cite news |url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/gundem/12041882.asp |publisher=H<U+00FC>rriyet |title=Ka<U+00E7><U+0131>r<U+0131>lan gemi limana demirledi |author=Ek<U+015F>i, <U+00D6>zg<U+00FC>r |date=2009-07-10 |accessdate=2009-07-19 |language=Turkish }}</ref> The vessel had experienced a hijacking attempt on March 19 the same year in that area.

== Hijacking ==
On March 19, 2009, the ''Horizon-1'' was harassed on its way from [[Ukraine]] to [[China]] in the Gulf of Aden by Somali pirates as she witnessed the hijacking of the Greek-owned vessel MV ''Titan''. The captain alarmed the naval forces, which were patrolling in the area. The attack on ''Horizon-1'' was prevented by the appearence of the naval forces.

In the morning of July 9, 2009 at 08:29 [[EEST]] (05:29 [[UTC]]), the ''Horizon-1'' was attacked again in the Gulf of Aden and hijacked by five armed pirates. She was carrying 33,000 tons of dry [[sulfur]] from [[Saudi Arabia]] to [[Jordan]].<ref name="h<U+00FC>r0710"/> As reported by the [[Turkish Navy]], the vessel was brought first to the [[Somalia|Somali]] port of Hordio, where she moored on July 9 at around 09:00 EEST (6:00 UTC). Turkish frigates [[TCG Gaziantep (F 490)|TCG ''Gaziantep'']] and [[TCG Gediz (F 495)|TCG ''Gediz'']] stood by in the vicinity.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.denizcilik.gov.tr/denizkaza/list.asp?SIRANO=1159 |publisher=Undersecretary of Maritime, Search and Rescue Coordination Center |title=Horizon-1 |accessdate=2009-07-19 }}</ref> On July 10, the ''Horizon-1'' left Hordio and sailed to the so-called [[pirate haven]] of [[Eyl]] in {{convert|60|nmi|km mi|abbr=on}} distance southwards, cruising at low speed for unknown reason.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cumhuriyet.com.tr/?im=yhs&hn=68020 |publisher=Cumhuriyet |title="Horizon-1" ba<U+015F>ka bir limana g<U+00F6>t<U+00FC>r<U+00FC>l<U+00FC>yor |date=2009-07-10 |accessdate=2009-07-19 |language=Turkish }}</ref>

At the time of the incident, the vessel's crew consisted of 23 Turks including the 24-year old, female [[third mate|third officer]] Aysun Akbay, a graduate of [[Black Sea Technical University]]'s Department of Deck at [[S<U+00FC>rmene]] Faculty of Marine Sciences. Contacted by phone, she reported that "all the crew members are alive and unharmed, resting in their [[cabin (ship)|cabin]]s and, their viands are not confiscated".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cnnturk.com/2009/turkiye/07/13/horizon.1in.aysun.kaptanindan.haber.var/534823.0/index.html |publisher=CNN News |title=Horizon-1'in Aysun kaptan<U+0131>ndan haber var |date=2009-07-13 |accessdate=2009-0719 |language=Turkish }}</ref>

While the ship's owner gave permission to the Turkish Navy for freeing the vessel and her crew by forced intervention, the Turkish government rejected this option due to lack of procedures in case of getting hold of the pirates. The Turkish officials rather preferred to contact [[Kenya]]n authorities for legal assistance, who have more experience in handling pirates from Somalia.<ref name="h<U+00FC>r0710"/>
