'''''The Disasters of War''''' (Spanish: '''''Los Desastres de la Guerra''''') is a series of 82<ref group=a>80 prints in the first published edition (1863), for which the last two plates were not available. See "[[#Execution|Execution]]".</ref> [[old master print|prints]] created between 1810 and 1820 by Spanish master painter and [[Printmaking|printmaker]] [[Francisco Goya]] (1746<U+2013>1828). Although Goya did not make known his intention in creating the plates, art historians view them as a visual protest against the violence of the 1808 [[Dos de Mayo Uprising]], the subsequent [[Peninsular War]] of 1808<U+2013>14 and the setbacks to the liberal cause following the [[Bourbon Restoration|restoration of the Bourbon monarchy]] in 1814. 

During the conflicts between [[Napoleon]]'s [[First French Empire|French Empire]] and Spain, Goya retained his position as first [[court painter]] to the Spanish crown and continued to produce portraits of the Spanish, French and English rulers.<ref name="Bareau, 45">Wilson-Bareau, 45</ref> Although deeply affected by the war, he kept private his thoughts on the art he produced in response to the conflict and its aftermath.<ref name="S129">Sayre, 129</ref> He was in poor health and almost deaf when, at 62, he began work on the prints. They were not published until 1863, 35 years after the artist's death. It is likely that only then was it considered politically safe to distribute a sequence of artworks criticising both the French and restored Bourbons.<ref name = "Jones 2003">Jones, Jonathan.

The name by which the series is known today is not Goya's own. His handwritten title on an album of [[Artist's proof|proofs]] given to a friend reads: '''''Fatal consequences of Spain's bloody war with Bonaparte, and other emphatic caprices''''' ('''''Fatales consequencias de la sangrienta guerra en Espa<U+00F1>a con Buonaparte, Y otros caprichos enf<U+00E1>ticos''''').<ref>Wilson-Bareau, 48<U+2013>9. This is the title of the album given to [[Juan Agust<U+00ED>n Ce<U+00E1>n Berm<U+00FA>dez]], written by Goya himself (illustrated Wilson-Bareau, 44), although the series is always referred to by the title given to the published set.</ref> Aside from the titles or captions given to each print, these are Goya's only known words on the series. With these works, Goya breaks from a number of painterly traditions. He rejects the bombastic heroics of most previous Spanish war art to show the effect of conflict on individuals. In addition he abandons colour in favour of a more direct truth he found in shadow and shade. 

The series was produced using a variety of [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio printmaking]] techniques, mainly [[etching]] for the line work and [[aquatint]] for the tonal areas, but also [[engraving]] and [[drypoint]].  As with many other Goya prints, they are sometimes referred to as aquatints, but more often as etchings.  They are usually considered in three groups which broadly mirror the order of their creation. The first 47 focus on incidents from the war and show the consequences of the conflict on individual soldiers and civilians. The middle series (plates 48 to 64) record the effects of the famine that hit Madrid in 1811<U+2013>12, before the city was liberated from the French. The final 17 reflect the bitter disappointment of liberals when the restored Bourbon monarchy, encouraged by the Catholic hierarchy, rejected the [[Spanish Constitution of 1812]] and opposed both state and religious reform.  Since their first publication, Goya's scenes of atrocities, starvation, degradation and humiliation have been described as the "prodigious flowering of rage"<ref name="C175">Connell, 175</ref> as well as the "work of a memory that knew no forgiveness."<ref>Vallentin</ref> The serial nature in which the plates unfold has led some to see the images as similar in nature to photography.<ref>Bryant, Clifton.

==Historical background==
[[Napoleon I of France]] declared himself [[First Consul]] of the [[French Republic]] on 18 February 1799, and was crowned Emperor in 1804. Because Spain controlled access to the Mediterranean, it was politically and strategically important to the French. The reigning Spanish sovereign, [[Charles IV of Spain|Charles&nbsp;IV]], was internationally regarded as ineffectual,<ref name="C1456">Connell, 145<U+2013>146</ref> and his position at the time was threatened by his pro-British heir, [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Crown Prince Ferdinand]]. Napoleon took advantage of Charles's weak standing by suggesting the two nations conquer Portugal<U+2014>the spoils to be divided equally between France, Spain and the Spanish Prime Minister, [[Manuel de Godoy]], who would take the title "Prince of the [[Algarve]]". Seduced by the French offer, Godoy accepted, failing to detect the true motivations of either Napoleon or Ferdinand, who both intended to use the invasion as a ploy to seize power in Spain.<ref name="C1456" />

[[Image:Francisco de Goya y Lucientes 023.jpg|left|thumb|In ''[[The Third of May 1808]]'', along with its companion work ''[[The Second of May 1808]]'', Goya sought to commemorate Spanish resistance to Napoleon's armies during the occupation of 1808.<ref>Hagen, Rose-Marie and Hagen, Rainer.

Under the guise of reinforcing the Spanish armies, 23,000 French troops entered Spain unopposed in November 1807.<ref>Baines, Edward. ''History of the Wars of the French Revolution''. Philadelphia: McCarty and Davis, 1835. 65</ref> Even when their intentions became clear the following February, the occupying forces faced little resistance besides isolated actions in disconnected areas.<ref name="C1456" /> In 1808, [[Mutiny of Aranjuez|a popular uprising]]<U+2014>incited by Ferdinand's supporters<U+2014>saw Godoy captured and left Charles with no choice but to [[abdication|abdicate]]; he did so on 19 March 1808, allowing his son to ascend the throne as Ferdinand&nbsp;VII. Ferdinand had been seeking French patronage,<ref>Crawley, Charles William. "War and peace in an age of upheaval: 1793<U+2013>1830". Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1965. 443<U+2013>444</ref> but Napoleon and his principal commander, Marshal [[Joachim Murat]], believed that Spain would benefit from rulers who were more progressive and competent than the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbons]]. They decided that Napoleon's brother, [[Joseph Bonaparte]], should be king.<ref name="l109">Licht, 109</ref> Under a pretext of mediation, Napoleon summoned Charles and Ferdinand to [[Bayonne]], France, where they were coerced into relinquishing their rights to the throne in favour of Joseph.

Like other Spanish liberals, Goya was left in a difficult position after the French invasion. He had supported the initial aims of the [[French Revolution]], and hoped its ideals would help liberate Spain from [[feudalism]] to become a secular, democratic political system. There were two conflicts being fought in Spain: the resistance against the French threat, and a domestic struggle between the ideals of liberal modernisation and the pre-political incumbent ruling class. The latter divide became more pronounced<U+2014>and the differences far more entrenched<U+2014>following the eventual withdrawal of the French.<ref name="Shaw482">Shaw, 482</ref> 

Several of Goya's friends, including the poets [[Juan Mel<U+00E9>ndez Vald<U+00E9>s]] and [[Leandro Fern<U+00E1>ndez de Morat<U+00ED>n]], were overt {{lang|es|''[[afrancesado]]s''}}: the supporters (or collaborators, in the view of many) of Joseph Bonaparte.<ref name="Bareau, 45"/> He maintained his position as court painter, for which an oath of loyalty to Joseph was necessary. However, Goya had an instinctive dislike of authority,<ref>Clark, 129</ref> and witnessed first-hand the subjugation of his countrymen by French troops.<ref group=a>That Goya had first-hand knowledge of events depicted in ''The Disasters of War'' is implied by the title of the print ''I saw it''.</ref> During these years he painted little aside from portraits of figures from all parties, including an allegorical painting of Joseph Bonaparte in 1810, [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wellington]] from 1812 to 1814, and French and Spanish generals.<ref group=a>Both the Bonaparte allegory and Wellington's medals and orders required updating soon after to reflect the changing situation <U+2013> Wilson-Bareau, 45, and, for Wellington, Neil MacLaren, revised Allan Braham, ''The Spanish School, National Gallery Catalogues''.

He visited many battle sites around Madrid to witness the Spanish resistance. The final plates are testament to what he described as "{{lang|es|''el desmembramiento d'Espa<U+00F1>a''}}"<U+2014>the dismemberment of Spain.<ref>Waring, Belle; Fee, Elizabeth.

==Plates==
Art historians broadly agree that ''The Disasters of War'' is divided into three thematic groupings<U+2014>war, famine, and political and cultural allegories.  This sequence broadly reflects the order in which the plates were created. Few of the plates or drawings are dated; instead, their chronology has been established by identifying specific incidents to which the plates refer,<ref name="H273">Hughes (2003), 273</ref> and the different batches of plates used, which allow sequential groups to be divined. For the most part, Goya's numbering agrees with these other methods.<ref>Wilson-Bareau, 49<U+2013>51, 57<U+2013>99</ref> However, there are several exceptions. For example, [[commons:File:Goya-Guerra (01).jpg|plate 1]] was among the last to be completed, after the end of the war.<ref>Wilson-Bareau, 49<U+2013>59, discusses the sequences of subjects and dates of creation in detail. For plate 1, see 51<U+2013>52.</ref>

In the early plates of the war grouping, Goya's sympathies appear to lie with the Spanish defenders. These images typically show patriots facing hulking, anonymous invaders who treat them with fierce cruelty. As the series progresses, the distinction between the Spanish and the imperialists becomes ambiguous. In other plates, it is difficult to tell from which camp the distorted and disfigured corpses belong. Some of the titles deliberately question the intentions of both sides; for example, ''Con razon <U+00F3> sin ella'' can mean ''with or without reason'', ''rightly or wrongly'', or ''for something or for nothing''. Critic Philip Shaw notes that the ambiguity is still present in the final group of plates, saying there is no distinction between the "heroic defenders of the Fatherland and the barbaric supporters of the old regime".<ref name="Shaw482" /> There have been a variety of English translations offered for the plate titles. In many instances, the satirical and often sardonic ambiguity and play on Spanish proverbs found in Goya's carefully worded original titles is lost.

Plates 1 to 47 consist mainly of realistic depictions of the horrors of the war fought against the French. Most portray the aftermath of battle; they include mutilated torsos and limbs mounted on trees, like "fragments of marble sculpture".<ref name="C175" /> Both French and Spanish troops tortured and mutilated captives; evidence of such acts is minutely detailed across a number of Goya's plates.<ref name="Robinson">Robinson, Maisah. "Review of Francisco Goya's Disasters of War". [[Associated Press]], 2006. Retrieved 28 August, 2009.</ref> Civilian death is also captured in detail. Spanish women were commonly victims of assault and rape. Civilians often followed armies to battle scenes.

Unlike most earlier Spanish art, Goya's rejects the ideals of heroic dignity. He refuses to focus on individual participants; though he drew from many classic art sources, his works pointedly portray the protagonists as anonymous casualties, rather than known patriots.<ref>Stochita & Coderch, 95</ref> The exception is [[commons:File:Goya-Guerra (07).jpg|plate 7]], ''Que valor!'' (''What courage!''), which depicts [[Agustina de Arag<U+00F3>n]] (1786<U+2013>1857), the heroine of [[Zaragoza]], who brought food to the [[cannon]]eers at the city defensive walls during the siege in which 54,000<ref>Wilson, Charles M.

The second group, plates 48 to 64, detail the effects of the famine which ravaged Madrid from August 1811 until after [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wellington]]'s armies liberated the city in August 1812. Starvation killed 20,000 people in the city that year.<ref>Hughes (2004), 297<U+2013>299; Wilson-Bareau, 50<U+2013>51</ref> In these plates, Goya's focus is directed away from the generalised scenes of slaughter of anonymous, unaligned people in unnamed regions of Spain; he turns towards a specific horror unfolding in Madrid. The famine was a result of many factors. For example, French invaders and Spanish guerrillas and bandits blocked paths and roads into the city, hampering the provision of food.

Goya does not focus on the reasons for the shortage, nor does he apportion blame to any one party. Instead, he is concerned only with its effect on the population.<ref name="H297">Hughes (2003), 297</ref> Although the images in the group were based on the experience of Madrid, none of the scenes depict specific events, and there are no identifiable buildings to place the scenes. Goya's focus is on the darkened masses of dead and barely alive bodies, men carrying corpses of women, and bereaved children mourning for lost parents.<ref>Hughes (2004), 297<U+2013>298</ref> Hughes believes [[commons:File:Goya-Guerra (50).jpg|plate 50]], ''Madre infeliz!'' (''Unhappy mother!''), to be the most powerful and poignant of the group.

Plates 65 to 82 were named "caprichos enf<U+00E1>ticos" ("emphatic [[Capriccio (painting)|caprices]]") in Goya's original series title.<ref group=a>"Caprichos enf<U+00E1>ticos" is difficult to translate; in the 18th century language of [[rhetoric]], "emphatic" suggests that these prints "make a point or give a warning by insinuation rather than by direct statement"<U+2014>Wilson-Bareau, 59, quoting from an undisclosed source.  Wilson-Bareau adds that "enf<U+00E1>ticos" is also often translated as "striking". In talking about art, "Caprice", usually found today as the original Italian [[Capriccio (painting)|capriccio]], normally suggests light-hearted fantasy, which does not characterise these prints or ''[[Los Caprichos]]''</ref> Completed between 1813 and 1820 and spanning Ferdinand VII's fall and return to power, they consist of allegorical scenes that critique post-war Spanish politics, including the [[Spanish Inquisition|Inquisition]] and the then-common judicial practice of torture. Although peace was welcomed, it produced a political environment that was in ways more repressive than before. The new regime stifled the hopes of liberals such as Goya, who used the term "fatal consequences" to describe the situation in his title for the series.<ref>Wilson-Bareau, 57<U+2013>60</ref><ref name="Berkeley">Cannizzo, Stephanie.

After the six years of [[absolute monarchy|absolutism]] that followed Ferdinand's return to the throne, on 1 January 1820, [[Rafael del Riego]] initiated an army revolt with the intent of restoring the [[Spanish Constitution of 1812|1812 Constitution]]. By March, the king was forced to agree, but by September 1823, after [[Spanish Civil War, 1820<U+2013>1823|an unstable period]], a French invasion supported by [[Quintuple Alliance|an alliance of the major powers]] had removed the constitutional government. The last prints were probably not completed until after the Constitution was restored, though certainly before Goya left Spain in May 1824. Their balance of optimism and cynicism makes it difficult to relate them directly to particular moments in these rapidly moving events.<ref>Wilson-Bareau, 57<U+2013>8</ref>

Many of these images return to the savage burlesque style seen in Goya's earlier ''[[Caprichos]]''. [[commons:File:Goya-Guerra (75).jpg|Plate 75]] ''Far<U+00E1>ndula de charlatanes'' (''Troupe of charlatans'') shows a priest with a parrot's head performing before an audience of donkeys and monkeys.<ref name="NYT" /> In [[commons:File:Goya-Guerra (77).jpg|plate 77]], a pope walking a tightrope was "prudently reduced" to a cardinal or bishop in the print published in 1863.<ref name=b59>Wilson-Bareau, 59</ref>  

Some prints showing animal scenes seem to draw from a satirical verse fable by [[Giovanni Battista Casti]], published in Italian in 1802; the ''[[Animal Farm]]'' of its day. In plate 74, the wolf, representing a minister, quotes from the fable<U+2014>"Miserable humanity, the fault is thine"<U+2014>and signs with Casti's name. The print "lays the blame for their rulers' barbarity on the victims' own acceptance of it".<ref>Wilson-Bareau, 59. See also plate 77 in the gallery at bottom.</ref>

A number of plates in this group reveal a scepticism towards [[idolatry]] of religious images. There are instances in the group where early Christian iconography, in particular statues and [[procession]]al images, are mocked and denigrated. [[commons:File:Goya-Guerra (67).jpg|Plate 67]], ''Esta no lo es menos'' (''This is no less curious''<!--"curious" only makes sense if viewed with plate 66-->), shows two statues carried by two stooped members of clergy. One statue is recognisable as the "Virgin of Solitude". In Goya's image, the statue is not carried vertically in processional triumph, rather it lies flat and undignified on the backs of the two almost crouched men. Shown horizontal, the object loses its aura, and becomes a mere everyday object. Art critics Victor Stochita and Anna Maria Coderch wrote, "It is in effect a deposed, toppled image, stripped of its powers and its connotations." Goya is making a general statement: that the Church's attempts to support and restore the Bourbons were "illusory, since what they proposed was nothing more than the adoration of an empty form".<ref name="S&C9092">Stochita & Coderch, 90<U+2013>92</ref>

The published edition of ''The Disasters of War'' ends as it begins; with the portrayal of a single, agonized figure.

==Execution==
Many of Goya's preparatory drawings, mostly in [[red chalk]], have survived and are numbered differently from the published prints.<ref>Wilson-Bareau, 49<U+2013>50</ref> He produced two albums of proofs<U+2014>among many individual proof impressions<U+2014>of which only one is complete.<ref group=a>The most important collection of individual proofs was acquired in Spain by [[Sir William Stirling-Maxwell, 9th Baronet]] from Valent<U+00ED>n Carderera, who probably got them from Goya's grandson. In 1951, they were sold to the [[Boston Museum of Fine Arts]]. Wilson-Bareau, 99. This collection includes a unique unfinished and unpublished print from the first group: ''Infame provecho (Vile Advantage)'', Boston MFA Accession number: 51.1697</ref> The full album consists of 85 works, including three small ''Prisioneros'' ("Prisoners") made in 1811 which are not part of the series. Goya gave the copy of the full album, now in the [[British Museum]], to his friend [[Juan Agust<U+00ED>n Ce<U+00E1>n Berm<U+00FA>dez]]. It contains a title-page inscription in Goya's hand, is signed at the page edges, and has numbers and titles to the prints written by Goya.  These were copied on the plates when the published edition was prepared in 1863. By then, 80 had passed from Goya's son, Javier<U+2014>who had stored them in Madrid after his father left Spain<U+2014>to the [[Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando]] (Royal Academy of Fine Arts of San Fernando), of which Goya had been director.  Numbers 81 and 82 rejoined the others in the Academy in 1870, and were not published until 1957.<ref>Spanish National Library [http://servicios.bne.es/productos/Goya/es_home_desastres.html web page on the series] (in Spanish). Retrieved 14 October, 2009</ref> As the series progressed, Goya evidently began to experience shortages of good quality paper and copper plates, and was forced to take what art historian Juliet Wilson-Bareau calls the "drastic step" of destroying two depicting landscapes, from which very few impressions had been printed. These were cut in half to produce four of ''The Disasters of War''{{'}}s prints.<ref name="B50">Wilson-Bareau, 50</ref> Partly because of the material shortages, the sizes and shapes of the plates vary somewhat, ranging from as small as 142 <U+00D7> 168&nbsp;mm (5.6 <U+00D7> 6.6&nbsp;in) to as large as 163 <U+00D7> 260&nbsp;mm (6.4 <U+00D7> 10.2&nbsp;in).<ref group=a>Plates [[commons:File:Goya-Guerra (14).jpg|14]] and [[commons:File:Goya-Guerra (24).jpg|24]], respectively.

Goya completed 56 plates during the [[Peninsular War|war against France]], and these are often viewed as eye-witness accounts. A final batch<U+2014>including plate 1, several in the middle of the series, and the last 17 plates<U+2014>are likely to have been produced after the end of the war, when materials were more abundant. The titles of some plates, written beneath each, indicate his presence: ''I saw this'' ([[commons:File:Goya-Guerra (44).jpg|plate 44]]) and ''One can not look'' ([[commons:File:Goya-Guerra (26).jpg|plate 26]]).<ref>[[Albert Boime|Boime, Albert]].

ISBN 0-226-06335-6</ref> While it is unclear how much of the conflict Goya witnessed, it is generally accepted that he observed first-hand many of the events recorded in the first two groups. A number of other scenes are known to have been related to him second hand.<ref name="C175" /> It is known that he used a sketchbook when visiting battle sites; at his studio, he set to work on [[Copper engraving|copper plate]] once he had absorbed and assimilated meaning from his sketches.<ref name="C175" /> All drawings are from the same paper, and all the copper plates are uniform.<ref name="Bareau, 57">Wilson-Bareau, 57</ref>

The titles of a number of scenes link pairs or larger groups, even if the scenes themselves are not related.  Examples include plates [[commons:File:Goya-Guerra (02).jpg|2]] and [[commons:File:Goya-Guerra (03).jpg|3]] (''With or without reason'' and ''The same''), [[commons:File:Goya-Guerra (04).jpg|4]] and [[commons:File:Goya-Guerra (05).jpg|5]] (''The woman are courageous'' and ''And they are fierce''), and [[commons:File:Goya-Guerra (09).jpg|9]], [[commons:File:Goya-Guerra (10).jpg|10]] and [[commons:File:Goya-Guerra (11).jpg|11]] (''They do not want to'', ''Nor these'' and ''Or these'').  Other plates show scenes from the same story or incident, as in plates [[commons:File:Goya-Guerra (46).jpg|46]] and [[commons:File:Goya-Guerra (47).jpg|47]] (''This is bad'' and ''This is how it happened''), in which a monk is murdered by French soldiers looting church treasures; a rare sympathetic image of the clergy, who are generally shown to be on the side of oppression and injustice.<ref name="Barnes">Fremont-Barnes, Gregory.

The Berm<U+00FA>dez album was borrowed by the Academy for the 1863 edition. The original titles or captions were etched onto the plates, even with Goya's spelling mistakes. One title was changed,<ref group=a>The title of [[commons:File:Goya-Guerra (69).jpg|plate 69]] was altered as "apparently&nbsp;... too nihilistic" from Goya's ''Nada. Ello lo dice'' to ''Nada. Ello dir<U+00E1>'' (Wilson-Bareau, 57).</ref> one plate had work added, and the printing was carried out with much more ink on the plates (producing "surface tone") than in the proofs, in accordance with mid-century taste.<ref>Wilson-Bareau, 46<U+2013>49</ref>  The Berm<U+00FA>dez set is considered "uniquely important&nbsp;... because it shows the series as Goya must have intended to publish it, and the way he intended the plates to be printed".<ref name="B50" />  There is therefore a distinction between the published edition of 1863, with 80 plates, and the full series in the album, which contains 82 (ignoring the three small ''Prisioneros'').  

''The Disasters of War'' was not published during Goya's lifetime, possibly because he feared political repercussions from Fernando VII's repressive regime.<ref>Hughes (2004), 303</ref><ref group=a>It has been suggested that Goya numbered the initial set of 56 plates in 1814, during a few months of national optimism following the end of the war, with the intent of publishing them then. However, on 11 May 1814, Fernando VII declared that the war would be forgotten and nullified the constitution, making publication impossible (Sayre, 128<U+2013>129).</ref> Some art historians suggest that he did not publish because he was sceptical about the use of images for political motives, and instead saw them as a personal meditation and release. Most, however, believe the artist preferred to wait until they could be made public without censorship.<ref>Stochita & Coderch, 91</ref><ref group=a>Licht speculates, "These plates obviously had to be created by the artist without any further thought about their ultimate purpose. Goya never intended them for publication during his lifetime." (Licht, 128).  Wilson-Bareau and Hughes disagree, see Wilson-Bareau p.59 and ''passim'' in chapter 4.</ref>  A further 80 editions were published, the last in 1937. As with his other series, later impressions show wear to the aquatint.<ref group=a>The 1863 edition had 500 impressions, and editions followed in 1892 (100) before which the plates were probably steel-faced to prevent further wear, 1903 (100), 1906 (275), and 1937.[http://www.spaightwoodgalleries.com/Pages/Goya_Desastres.html Spaightwood Galleries] accessed October 18, 2009</ref>

In 1873, Spanish novelist [[Antonio de Trueba]] published the purported reminiscences of Goya's gardener, Isidro, on the genesis of the series. de Trueba claims to have spoken to Isidro in 1836, when the gardener recalled accompanying Goya to the hill of [[Principe Pio]] to sketch the victims of the [[The Third of May 1808|executions of 3 May 1808]].<ref group=a>"As midnight approached, my master said, 'Isidro, take your gun and come with me.' I obeyed him and where do you think we went?<U+2014>To that hill where the bodies of those poor people still lay&nbsp;.... My master opened his portfolio, put it on his lap and waited for the moon to come out from behind the large cloud that was hiding it&nbsp;.... At last the moon shone so brightly that it seemed like daylight. Amidst the pools of blood, we could make out some of the corpses<U+2014>some lying on their backs, others on their bellies; this one in a kneeling position, that one with his arms raised toward heaven, begging for vengeance or mercy&nbsp;.... While I stared at the terrible scene, filled with dread, my master drew it. We returned home and the next morning my master showed me his first print of ''La Guerra'', which I looked at in horror. 'Sir,' I asked him, 'Why do you draw these barbarities which men commit?' He replied, 'To warn men not to be barbarians ever again.' "Ferrari, Enrique Lafuente; Licht et al, 82<U+2013>83</ref> Goya scholars are sceptical of the account; Nigel Glendinning described it as a "romantic fantasy", and detailed its many inaccuracies.<ref group=a>In a BBC television documentary, Glendinning said: "Trueba is clearly romanticising the artist, making the artist fearless and heroic, I mean not to just observe through the spy glass these terrible things that are happening, but actually going to see them&nbsp;.... None of this corresponds at all to the reality of the shootings.  Because we know the shootings took place at four or five o'clock in the morning. Some modern experts point out it was also raining, and so the idea that Goya is going out at midnight, he's not going to see anything. None of this fits with historical information we have." Glendinning also pointed out that Trueba places Goya in his house known as ''Quinta del Sordo''. Goya moved into this house in 1819, after the war, casting further doubt on Trueba's version.

==Technique and style==

Detailing and protesting the ugliness of life is a common theme throughout the history of Spanish art, from the dwarves of [[Diego Vel<U+00E1>zquez]] to  [[Pablo Picasso]]'s ''[[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]]'' (1937). Reflecting on ''The Disasters of War'', biographer Margherita Abbruzzese notes that Goya asks that the truth "be seen and&nbsp;... shown to others; including those who have no wish to see it&nbsp;.... And the blind in spirit stay their eyes on the outward aspect of things, then these outward aspects must be twisted and deformed until they cry out what they are trying to say."<ref name="C175" /> The series follows a wider European tradition of war art and the examination of the effect of military conflict on civilian life<U+2014>probably mostly known to Goya via prints. This tradition is reflected especially in Dutch depictions of the [[Eighty Years' War]] with Spain, and in the work of 16th-century German artists like [[Hans Baldung]]. It is believed Goya owned a copy of a famous set of 18 etchings by [[Jacques Callot]] known as ''[[Les Grandes Mis<U+00E8>res de la guerre]]'' (1633), which record the devastating impact on [[Lorraine (region)|Lorraine]] of [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]]'s troops during the [[Thirty Years' War]].<ref>Becker DP; in Spangeberg, Kristin (ed).

[[File:Belvedere Torso, Vatican.jpg|thumb|120px|left|The ''[[Belvedere Torso]]'' influenced Goya's depiction of mutilated corpses.

The figuration of the dead man in plate 47, ''[[This is worse|Esto es peor]]'' (''This is worse''), which depicts the mutilated body of a Spanish fighter on a tree, surrounded by the corpses of French soldiers, is based in part on the [[Hellenistic]] fragment of a male nude, the ''[[Belvedere Torso]]'' by the Athenian "Apollonios son of Nestor". Goya had earlier made a black wash drawing study of the statue during a visit to Rome. In ''Esto es peor'', however, he subverts the classical motifs used in war art by adding a degree of theatre <U+2013> the branch piercing the body through the anus, twisted neck and close framing..<ref name="S&C95">Stoichita & Coderch, 95<U+2013>96</ref> The man is naked; a daring factor for Spanish art in the 19th century, during the time of the [[Spanish Inquisition]].<ref>Cottom, 58</ref> Art critic [[Robert Hughes (critic)|Robert Hughes]] remarked that the figures in this image "remind us that, if only they had been marble and the work of their destruction had been done by time rather than sabres, neo-classicists like [[Anton Raphael Mengs|Menges]] would have been in aesthetic raptures over them."<ref>Hughes (2004), 295</ref>

[[Image:Goya-Guerra (37).jpg|thumb|alt=A dismembered and mutilated corpse is impaled on the branches of a tree|Plate 37: ''Esto es peor'' (''[[This is worse]]''). In the aftermath of battle, the mutilated torsos and limbs of civilian victims were mounted on trees, like "fragments of marble sculpture".<ref name="C175" />]] 

Goya abandons colour in the series, believing that light, shade and shadow provide for a more direct expression of the truth. He wrote, "In art there is no need for colour. Give me a crayon and I will 'paint' your portrait."<ref name ="Holland253" /> He uses line not so much to delineate shape but, according to art historian Anne Hollander, "to scratch forms into existence and then splinter them, as a squinting, half blind eye might apprehend them, to create the distorting visual detritus that shudders around the edge of things seen in agonized haste&nbsp;.... This 'graphic' kind of clarity can be most sharp when it is most jagged."<ref>Hollander, 254</ref> The immediacy of the approach suited his desire to convey the primitive side of man's nature. He was not the first to work in this manner; [[Rembrandt]] had sought a similar directness, but did not have access to aquatint. [[William Blake]] and [[Henry Fuseli]], contemporaries of Goya's, produced works with similarly fantastical content, but, as Hollander describes, they muted its disturbing impact with "exquisitely applied linearity ... lodging it firmly in the safe citadels of beauty and rhythm."<ref>Hollander, 254<U+2013>55</ref>

In his 1947 book on Goya's etchings, English author [[Aldous Huxley]] observed that the images depict a recurrent series of pictorial themes: darkened archways "more sinister than those even of [[Giovanni Battista Piranesi|Piranesi]]'s ''Prisons''"; street corners as settings for the cruelty of the disparities of class; and silhouetted hilltops carrying the dead, sometimes featuring a single tree serving as gallows or repository for dismembered corpses. "And so the record proceeds, horror after horror, unalleviated by any of the splendors which other painters have been able to discover in war; for, significantly, Goya never illustrates an engagement, never shows us impressive masses of troops marching in column or deployed in the order of battle&nbsp;.... All he shows us is war's disasters and squalors, without any of the glory or even picturesqueness."<ref name="h12-13">Huxley, 12<U+2013>13</ref>

''The Disasters of War'' is the second of Goya's four major print series, which constitute almost all of his most important work in the medium. He also created 35 prints early in his career<U+2014>many of which are reproductions of his portraits and other works<U+2014>and about 16 [[lithograph]]s while living in France.<ref>Wilson-Bareau, Chapter 2. See also the listings of Harris catalogue numbers for all the prints on 100<U+2013>106</ref> Goya created his first series, the 80-plate ''[[Caprichos]]'', between 1797 and 1799 to document "the innumerable foibles and follies to be found in any civilized society, and&nbsp;... the common prejudices and deceitful practices which custom, ignorance, or self-interest have made usual."<ref>Hughes (2004), 181.  Wilson-Bareau, 23<U+2013>26 for dates.</ref> ''Caprichos'' was put on sale in 1799, but was almost immediately withdrawn after threats from the [[Spanish Inquisition|Inquisition]].<ref>Wilson-Bareau, 23</ref> In ''The Disasters of War''{{'}}s first two groups of prints, Goya largely departs from the imaginative, synthetic approach of ''Caprichos'' to [[Realism (arts)|realistically]] depict life-and-death scenes of war. In the last group, the ''Caprichos''{{'}} sense of the fantastic returns. 

[[Image:Disparates_13.jpg|thumb|Plate 13 from the "Disparate" series; ''Modo de volar'' (''Way to fly''), 1816<U+2013>1823. In the third grouping of plates in the ''The Disasters of War'' Goya returned in part to the fantastical imagery he had explored in the ''Caprichos''|alt=4 or 5 men fly with contraptions resembling bat's wings attached to their arms.]]
Between 1815 and 1816, Goya produced the ''[[commons:Category:Tauromachia|Tauromachia]]'', a series of 33 [[bullfighting]] scenes, during a break from ''The Disasters of War''. ''Tauromachia'' was not politically sensitive, and was published at the end of 1816 in an edition of 320<U+2014>for sale individually or in sets<U+2014>without incident. It did not meet with critical or commercial success.<ref>Wilson-Bareau, 61, 64, & 67</ref> In France, Goya completed a set of four larger lithographs, ''[[commons:Category:Los_toros_de_Burdeos|Los toros de Burdeos]]'' (''The Bulls of Bordeaux'').<ref>Wilson-Bareau, 91<U+2013>95</ref>  His final series, known as ''[[commons:Category:Los_disparates|Los Disparates]]'' (''The Follies''),  ''Proverbios'' (''Proverbs''), or ''Sue<U+00F1>os'' (''Dreams''), contains 22 large plates and at least five drawings that are seemingly part of the series but which were never etched.  All these were left in Madrid<U+2014>apparently incomplete and with only a handful of proofs printed<U+2014>when Goya went to France in 1823.  One plate is known to have been etched in 1816, but little else is established about the chronology of the works, or Goya's plans for the set.<ref>Wilson-Bareau, 77<U+2013>78</ref>

Goya worked on ''The Disasters of War'' during a period when he was producing images more for his own satisfaction than for any contemporary audience.<ref group=a>Goya's introspection late in this period can be witnessed in the enigmatic ''[[Black Paintings]]'' which he painted directly onto the walls of his house between 1819 and 1823.</ref> His work came to rely less on historical incidents than his own imagination. Many of the later plates contain fantastical motifs which can be seen as a return to the imagery of the ''Caprichos''. In this, he is relying on visual clues derived from his inner life, rather than anything that could be recognised from real events or settings.<ref name ="Holland253">Hollander, 253</ref>

==Interpretation==

In ''The Disasters of War'' there is no purpose to the random slaughter<U+2014>the plates are devoid of the consolation of either divine order or the dispensation of human justice.<ref name="l130-152">Licht, 130<U+2013>152</ref> This is due in part to the lack of melodrama or consciously artful presentation that would distance the viewer from the brutality of the subjects, as in works of [[Baroque]] martyrdom. In addition, Goya refuses to offer the stability of traditional narrative. Instead, his composition tends to highlight the most disturbing aspects of each work.<ref name="l132-142">Licht, 132<U+2013>142</ref> 
[[File:Goya-Guerra Cropped.jpg|thumb|200px|Title page of the first edition (1863)|alt=Title page reading "Los Desastres de la Guerra ... DON FRANCISCO GOYA." At bottom is a publisher's colophon and "MADRID. 1863."]]

The events occur in spaces without fixed boundaries; the mayhem extends outside the frames of the picture plane in all directions.<ref name="l132-142"/> In this way, the works underscore the randomness of violence; in their immediacy and brutality they have been described as analogous to 19th- and 20th-century [[photojournalism]].<ref name="l130-133, 143-144">Licht, 130<U+2013>133, 143<U+2013>144</ref> According to Robert Hughes, as with Goya's earlier ''Caprichos'', ''The Disasters of War'' is likely to have been intended as a "social speech"; satires on the then prevailing "hysteria, evil, cruelty and irrationality [and] the absence of wisdom" of Spain under Napoleon, and later the Inquisition.<ref name="H263">Hughes (1990), 63</ref> It is evident Goya viewed the Spanish war with disillusionment, and despaired both for the violence around him and for the loss of a liberal ideal he believed was being replaced by a new militant unreason. Hughes believes Goya's decision to render the images through etchings, which by definition are absent of colour, indicates feelings of utter hopelessness.<ref name="H263" /> 

[[File:Callothanging.jpg|240px|left|thumb|''La Pendaison'' (''The Hanging''), a plate from French artist [[Jacques Callot]]'s 1623 series ''[[Les Grandes Mis<U+00E8>res de la guerre]]''. It is likely that Callot's etchings of a disorderly army were an influence on Goya|alt=The bodies of captive men hang from trees while soldiers and civilians look on. A man to the right comforts a woman]]

His message late in life is contrary to the humanistic view of man as essentially good but easily corrupted. He seems to be saying that violence is innate in man, "forged in the substance of what, since [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]], we have called the [[id, ego, and super-ego|id]]." Hughes believes that in the end there is only the violated emptiness of acceptance of our fallen nature: like the painting of [[The Dog (Goya)|Goya's dog]], "whose master is as absent from him as God is from Goya."<ref>Hughes (1990), 64</ref>

''The Disasters of War'' is preoccupied with wasted bodies, undifferentiated body parts, castration and female abjection. There are dark erotic undertones to a number of the works. Connell notes the innate sexuality of the image in plate 7<U+2014>[[Agustina de Arag<U+00F3>n]]'s igniting a long cannon.<ref name="C162" /> The art historian Lennard Davis suggests that Goya was fascinated with the "erotics of dismemberment",<ref>Shaw, 485</ref> while Hughes mentions [[commons:File:Disparates 10.jpg|plate 10]] in ''Los disparates'', which shows a woman carried in the grip of a horse's mouth. To Hughes, the woman's euphoria suggests, among other possible meanings, orgasm.<ref name="H263" />

==Legacy==

Despite being one of the most significant anti-war works of art, ''The Disasters of War'' had no impact on the European consciousness for two generations, as it was not seen outside a small circle in Spain until it was published by Madrid's [[Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando|Royal Academy of San Fernando]] in 1863.<ref>Hughes (2004), 304</ref> Since then, interpretations in successive eras have reflected the sensibilities of the time. Goya was seen as a proto-[[Romanticism|Romantic]] in the early 19th century, and the series' graphically rendered dismembered carcasses were a direct influence on [[Th<U+00E9>odore G<U+00E9>ricault]],<ref name="H51">Hughes (1990), 51</ref> best known for the politically charged ''[[The Raft of the Medusa|Raft of the Medusa]]'' (1818<U+2013>19). [[Luis Bu<U+00F1>uel]] identified with Goya's sense of the absurd, and referenced his works in such films as ''[[L'<U+00C2>ge d'or]]'' (1930), on which he collaborated with Salvador Dal<U+00ED>, and ''[[The Exterminating Angel (film)|The Exterminating Angel]]'' (1962).<ref name="H51" />

The series' impact on Dal<U+00ED> is evident in ''[[Soft Construction with Boiled Beans (Premonition of Civil War)]]'', painted in 1936 in response to events leading to the [[Spanish Civil War]]. Here, the distorted limbs, brutal suppression, agonised expressions and ominous clouds are reminiscent  of [[commons:File:Goya-Guerra (39).jpg|plate 39]], ''Grande haza<U+00F1>a! Con muertos!''

In 1993, [[Jake and Dinos Chapman]] of the [[Young British Artists]] movement created 82 miniature, toy-like sculptures modelled on ''The Disasters of War''. The works were widely acclaimed and were purchased that year by the [[Tate]] gallery.<ref>[http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?cgroupid=999999961&workid=26398&searchid=12001 Disasters of War  1993].

|Goya-Guerra (04).jpg|A terrific hand-to-hand combat between two women and two armed soldiers. They fight with their fists and with swords.|Plate 4: ''Las mujeres dan valor'' (''The women are courageous''). This plate depicts a struggle between a group of civilians fighting soldiers|Goya-Guerra (05).jpg|A struggle between nine or more civilians including both men and women against the soldiers. Several civilians have fallen dead, a woman prepares to throw a stone at a soldier's head, while another woman rams a soldier with a long pole, he falls sword in hand, others fight at close quarters with swords and knives. A uniformed soldier to the far right fires his rifle at the civilians shooting them down.
|Plate 5: ''Y son fieras'' (''And they are fierce'' or ''And they fight like wild beasts''). 
Soldiers murder priests with bladed swords|Goya-Guerra (46).jpg|Soldiers in large fur hats, long coats and winter uniforms murder priests by running them through with their long bladed swords. 
|Plate 46: ''Esto es malo'' (''This is bad''). A monk is killed by French soldiers looting church treasures. A rare sympathetic image of a clergy generally shown on the side of oppression and injustice<ref name="Barnes" />
|Goya-Guerra (47).jpg|As the priests lay dead, soldiers make off with a large load of stolen church plate|Plate 47: ''As<U+00ED> sucedi<U+00F3>'' (''This is how it happened''). The last print in the first group. Murdered monks lay by French soldiers loot church treasures<ref name="Barnes"/> 
|Goya-Guerra (64).jpg|A cart is being loaded with the dead. A man hoists the body of a woman into the arms of a third man standing in the cart, while two other men carry more bodies to the cart to be loaded.|Plate 64: ''Carretadas al cementerio'' (''Cartloads for the cemetery''). The last print in the famine group
|Goya-Guerra (65).jpg|An official writes a report into a notebook as a woman in a white nightgown nearly swoons with her head in her hands, a man next to her holds his head in his hands expressing both fear and grief and a dog at his feet growls and threatens|Plate 65: ''Qu<U+00E9> alboroto es este?'' (''What is this hubbub?''). The first print in the final group. The woman likely represents the rejected Constitution of 1814<ref name="b59"/>
|Goya-Guerra (77).jpg|A cleric walks a tightrope (that is on the verge of breaking.) across the town plaza and over the heads of the people down below.|Plate 77: ''Que se rompe la cuerda!'' (''May the rope break!''). In the preparatory drawing the cleric was a Pope
|Goya-Guerra (78).jpg|Surrounded by wild wolves, a horse kicks and bucks defending its freedom and its life. A group of wolf hounds look on passively|Plate 78: ''Se defiende bien'' (''He defends himself well''). The horse appears to be a metaphor for the constitutional monarchy, fighting without help from the wolf-hounds, who perhaps represent anti-monarchical revolution<ref>Wilson-Bareau, 59. This is one of the prints apparently drawing from Giovanni Battista Casti</ref>
