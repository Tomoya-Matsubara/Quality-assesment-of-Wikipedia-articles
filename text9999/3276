The '''Carm<U+00E9>n<U+00E8>re''' grape is a [[wine]] [[grape]] variety originally planted in the [[M<U+00E9>doc]] region of [[Bordeaux]], [[France]] where it was used to produce deep [[red wine]]s and occasionally used for blending purposes in the same manner as [[Petit Verdot]]. A member of the Cabernet family of grapes, the name "Carm<U+00E9>n<U+00E8>re" originates from the French word for crimson (''carmin'') after the hue of the grape in fall. <ref name="Berberoglu"> Hrayr Berberoglu [http://www.foodreference.com/html/artcarmenere.html CARMENERE] Foodreference.com</ref> The grape is also known as ''[[Grand Vidure]]'', a historic Bordeaux synonym, although current [[European Union]] regulations prohibit Chilean imports under this name into the EU. <ref name="Clarke pg 61"> O. Clarke ''Encyclopedia of Grapes'' pg 61 Harcourt Books 2001 ISBN 0151007144 </ref>

Rarely found in France today, the world's largest area planted with this variety is in [[Wines of Chile|Chile]] in [[South America]], with more than 4,000 [[Hectare]]s (2006) cultivated in the [[Chile Central Valley|Central Valley]]. It is also found in Italy's Eastern [[Veneto]] and [[Friuli-Venezia Giulia]] regions. <ref>

==Origin==
The Carmen<U+00E8>re grape originated in the [[M<U+00E9>doc]] region of Bordeaux, [[France]] and was also widely planted in the [[Graves]] until the vines were struck with [[oidium]].  <ref name="Robinson pg 198"> J. Robinson ''Vines, Grapes & Wines'' pg 198 Mitchell Beazley Publishing 1986 ISBN 1857329996 </ref> It is almost impossible to find Carm<U+00E9>n<U+00E8>re wines in France today, as a [[Phylloxera]] plague in 1867 nearly destroyed all the vineyards of Europe, afflicting the Carm<U+00E9>n<U+00E8>re grapevines in particular such that for many years the grape was presumed [[extinct]]. When the vineyards were replanted, growers could not replant Carm<U+00E9>n<U+00E8>re as it was extremely hard to find and more difficult to grow than other grape varieties common to Bordeaux. The region's damp, chilly spring weather gave rise to [[coulure]], "a condition endemic to certain vines in climates which have marginal, sometimes cool, wet springs",<ref name="Block">S. Block [http://www.beveragebusiness.com/bbcontent/art-arch/block1002.html When I first heard about Carmenere-I was certain it was a hoax] Massachusetts Beverage Business </ref> which prevented the vine's buds from flowering. Yields were lower than other varieties and the crops were rarely healthy; consequently wine growers chose more versatile and less coulure-susceptible grapes when re-planting the vines.

==Growth in Chile==
Fortunately, this [[grape|grapevine]] variety had been exported to [[Chile]] in 1850, where wine growers modeled the wineries after those in France. Thus in the 1850s cuttings from Bordeaux, which included Carm<U+00E9>n<U+00E8>re grape, were planted in the valleys around [[Santiago]], Chile. <ref name="Block"> </ref> During most of the 20th century, Chilean growers beleived the Carmen<U+00E8>re to be [[Merlot]] and it was inadvertently collected and processed together with Merlot grapes (probably reaching up to 50% of the total volume) giving Chilean Merlots an inexplicably rich and superior quality. In 1994, Professor '''[[Jean-Michel Bousiquot]]''' from the [[Montpellier]]'s school of [[Oenology]] confirmed that it was ''Bordeaux Carm<U+00E9>n<U+00E8>re'', not Merlot. <ref name="Block"> </ref>Today Carmen<U+00E8>re grows chiefly in the [[Rapel Valley]] and [[Maipo Province]].<ref> H. Johnson & J. Robinson ''The World Atlas of Wine'' pg 298 Mitchell Beazley Publishing 2005 ISBN 1840003324 </ref> 

Further genetic research has shown that the variety may be distantly related to [[Merlot]]. It is claimed by some that the variety name is an alias for what is actually the [[Vidure]], a local Bordeaux name for a [[Cabernet Sauvignon]] clone once thought to be the grape from which all red Bordeaux varieties originated. Another theory holds that the true name should be [[Biturica]], thought to be an ancient variety that originated from [[Iberia]] (modern-day [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]]) as claimed by [[Pliny the Elder]]; indeed, it is currently a popular blending variety with [[Sangiovese]] in [[Tuscany]] called "Predicato di Biturica". As the Chilean wine industry grows, more experimentation is being carried out on Carmen<U+00E8>re's potential as a blending grape, especially with Cabernet Sauvignon. <ref> C. Fallis ''The Encyclopedic Atlas of Wine'' pg 144 Global Book Publishing 2004 ISBN 1740480503 </ref>

Chile's minimal rainfall during the growing season allows for healthier crops of Carmen<U+00E8>re and there has been no spread of [[phylloxera]] thanks to the protection of the country's natural boundaries. 
Although wines are produced closely following the French model, attempts by French growers to bring back and re-adapt Carm<U+00E9>n<U+00E8>re vines from Chile after 1994 have not yielded good enough results and to date have been abandoned.

== Carmen<U+00E8>re & Merlot ==
[[Image:Carmenere Merlot.jpg|right|thumb|Differences between Carmen<U+00E8>re and Merlot grapes]]
The similarities in appearance have linked the two vines for centuries and their cuttings were imported together from 19th century Bordeaux. Despite the similarities, there are some noticeable differences that aid the [[ampelographer]] in identifying the two vines. When young, Carmen<U+00E8>re [[leaves]] have a reddish hue underneath, while the leaves of Merlot are white. There are also slight differences in [[leaf shape]] with the central lobe of Merlot leaves being longer. <ref name="Clarke pg 60"> O. Clarke ''Encyclopedia of Grapes'' pg 60 Harcourt Books 2001 ISBN 0151007144 </ref>

Merlot ripens three weeks earlier then Carmen<U+00E8>re. In cases were the vineyards are inter-dispersed with both varieties, the time of [[harvest]] is paramount in determining the character of the resulting blends. If Merlot grapes are picked when Carmen<U+00E8>re is fully ripe, they will be overripe and impart a "jammy" character. If the grapes are picked earlier when only the Merlot grapes have reached ripeness, the Carmen<U+00E8>re will have an aggressive [[green pepper]] flavor. <ref name="Clarke pg 60"> </ref>

[[Concha y Toro Winery|Concha y Toro]], a Chilean winery, has 100 hectares planted from a Carmen<U+00E8>re [[clone]] and produces a varietal that is aged in both French and American white oak barrels for at least 3 <U+2013> 4 years before release.<ref name="Berberoglu"> </ref>


== Viticulture ==
Carmen<U+00E8>re favors a long growing season in moderate to warm climates. During harvest time and the winter period the vine fares poorly if it is introduced to high levels of rain or [[irrigation]] water. This is particularly true in poor soil plantings where the vine would need more water. The influence of water during this period accentuates the herbaceous and green pepper characteristics of the grape. The grape naturally develops high levels of sugar before the [[tannins]] achieve ripeness. If grown in too hot a climate the resulting wine will have a high alcohol level and low balance. <ref name="Clarke pg 60"> </ref>
