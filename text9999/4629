The '''[[1997 NFL season|1997]] [[New England Patriots]] season''' was the 28th season for the team in the [[National Football League]] and 38th season overall. In January, when the Patriots were preparing to face the [[Green Bay Packers]] in [[Super Bowl XXXI]], it was suspected head coach [[Bill Parcells]] was looking to move to another team after the game where he would have more say over personnel matters. In the [[1996 NFL Draft]], Parcells' relationship with owner [[Robert Kraft]] soured when Kraft selected wide receiver [[Terry Glenn]] against Parcells' wishes.<ref name="FD">{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FCL/is_4_30/ai_66760539/|title=Take That!|work=[[Football Digest]]|date=December 2000|accessdate=2007-12-16}}</ref> After the Patriots' loss in Super Bowl XXXI, Parcells resigned from the Patriots, using the phrase "If they want you to cook the dinner, at least they ought to let you shop for some of the groceries."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1997/02/01/sports/parcells-seeking-new-kitchen.html|title=Parcells Seeking New Kitchen|work=[[The New York Times]]|first=George|last=Vecsey|date=1997-02-01|accessdate=2009-06-17}}</ref> Due to an earlier renegotiation that had elminated the [[1997 New England Patriots season|1997]] season from Parcells' contract, NFL Commissioner [[Paul Tagliabue]] ruled Parcells could not be a head coach for another team in 1997.<ref name="FD" /> Parcells instead moved to the [[New York Jets]] as a "consultant," taking assistant head coach [[Bill Belichick]] with him to be the Jets' head coach; Kraft called this a "transparent farce" and accused the Jets of tampering with Parcells.<ref name="FD" /> The NFL ruled in the Patriots' favor and the Patriots received third and fourth-round picks in the [[1997 NFL Draft]], a second-round pick in the [[1998 NFL Draft]], and a first-round pick in the [[1999 NFL Draft]] in compensation for allowing Parcells to become the Jets' head coach.<ref name="FD" />

Taking Parcells' place with the Patriots was [[Pete Carroll]], who had coincidentally been the Jets' head coach in [[1994 New York Jets season|1994]]. The Patriots began the season 5<U+2013>1 but featured a 6<U+2013>5 record later in the season. The Patriots managed to finish 10<U+2013>6 and first in the [[AFC East]] for the second straight season. With the third seed in the [[American Football Conference|AFC]] [[NFL playoffs, 1997<U+2013>98|playoffs]], the Patriots defeated the [[Miami Dolphins]] in the Wild Card Playoffs but were defeated by the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], 7<U+2013>6, on the road the next week.

==Notable games==
* September 14 vs. [[New York Jets]]:

The first game against former Patriots coach [[Bill Parcells]] came on [[Sunday Night Football]] with the Patriots 2-0 and the Jets 1-1.  The game became a grinder in which the lead tied or changed seven times.  [[Drew Bledsoe]] threw touchdows to [[Ben Coates]] and [[Lovett Purnell]] but threw two picks (one returned by [[Mo Lewis]] for a touchdown) and was limited to just 162 passing yards.  His Jets counterpart [[Neil O'Donnell]] ran in one touchdown and threw another to [[Keyshawn Johnson]] that tied the game in the fourth, but was sacked seven times; the Jets also coughed up three fumbles.  [[Curtis Martin]]'s running game erupted to 199 yards and a touchdown, but the Patriots faced Jets kicker [[John Hall (American football)|John Hall]] in the final sixteen seconds with the game tied at 24.  Hall's field goal try was blocked and in overtime the Patriots drove down field and [[Adam Vinatieri]] nailed a 34-yard field goal for the 27-24 Patriots win.
