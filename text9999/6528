[[File:Leaf Hills.jpg|thumb|275px|right|Photograph c. 1895 of Leaf Hills in west-central [[Minnesota]]]]The '''Leaf Hills Moraines''', sometimes called the '''Leaf Mountains''', are a range of hills in west-central [[Minnesota]].  The land, while not exhibiting many characteristics of mountains, nevertheless rises typically to a height of {{convert|100|ft|m|0}} to {{convert|300|ft|m|0}} above the surrounding farmland through the duration of its range, occasionally reaching higher than {{convert|350|ft|m|0}}.  The name of this range of hills is translated from the [[Anishinaabe language|Ojibwe]] ''Gaaskibag-wajiwan'', which was interpreted by [[Joseph Gilfillan|Gilfillan]] as <U+201C>Rustling Leaf Mountains.<U+201D>  The name is also shared by [[Leaf Mountain Township, Minnesota|Leaf Mountain Township]], the two Leaf Lakes ("''Gaaskibag-wajiwi-zaaga'iganan''"), and the [[Leaf River (Minnesota)|Leaf River]] ("''Gaaskibag-wajiwi-ziibi''"), all named for the hills.<ref name = Upham>{{cite book| last =Upham| first =Warren| authorlink =Warren Upham| title =Minnesota Place Names, A Geographical Encyclopedia, 3rd Edition| publisher =Minnesota Historical Society| date =2001| location =Saint Paul, Minnesota| pages =pp. 425, 433| isbn =0-87351-396-7}}</ref>  In turn, the hills in Ojibwe are named after [[Inspiration Peak]] ("''Gaaskibag-wajiw''"), the highest hill of this hill range.

==Description==
The hills are described by [[Warren Upham|Upham]] as "running southeast from Fergus Falls to the south line of the county and thence east and northeast to East Leaf Lake, a distance of 50 miles."<ref name = Upham/>  Through their full extent in [[Otter Tail County]], the hills have steeply sloped sides covered by [[prairie|prairies]] and [[deciduous]] forests, primarily [[Maple]] and [[Oak]].  In most regions these hills would not be considered mountains, but in generally flat Minnesota they are significant and unique features of the landscape, much more notable than in a really mountainous area.

==Geology==
The hills are formed by the convergence of the eighth and ninth [[moraines|marginal moraines]] formed by the [[Wadena lobe|Wadena]] and [[Des Moines lobe]]s of the [[Wisconsonian glaciation]].  This moraine forms an arc about ten to twenty miles (16&nbsp;-32&nbsp;km) wide and 200 miles (320&nbsp;km) long.  It is composed of a huge volume of morainic drift up to {{convert|350|ft|m|0}} thick, overlain with thin sandy soil as well as rocks and boulders.<ref name = Sansome>{{cite book  | last = Sansome  | first = Constance Jefferson | title = Minnesota Underfoot:   A Field Guide to the State's Outstanding Geologic Features | publisher = Voyageur Press | date = 1983 | location = Stillwater, MN | pages = 142<U+2013>43 | isbn = 0-89658-036-9}}</ref>

==Landforms==

The hills' outline is not regular, but erratic, and in many places the range is broken by rivers, streams, and Minnesota<U+2019>s famous lakes.  Only a few of the many high points of the range have received names.  Prominent among them are [[Indian Hill (Minnesota)|Indian Hill]] and [[Inspiration Peak]].

==History==
[[Paleoindians]] lived in the area at least 6,000 years ago,<ref name = Parkinfo/> and perhaps longer, as earlier remains have been found in the general vicinity.<ref name = MnGeol>{{cite book | last = Ojakangas  | first = Richard W. | authorlink = | coauthors = Charles L.

Also in the Eighteenth Century, the area became a source of pelts for the [[fur trade]].  In the 1840s, the mountains were pierced by the [[Red_River_Trails#Woods_Trail|Woods Trail]] and skirted by the [[Red_River_Trails#East_Plains_Trail|East Plains Trail]], two of the [[Red River Trails]] between [[Fort Garry]] (modern [[Winnipeg]]) and [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]].<ref name = Gilman>{{cite book  | last = Gilman  | first = Rhoda R.  | coauthors = Carolyn Gilman & Deborah M.

Due to their steepness and the abundance of [[fieldstone]] and boulders, the hills were found by pioneers to be generally unsuitable for plowing but well suited for raising and grazing [[livestock]]. Part of the region has been preserved in [[Maplewood State Park]].
