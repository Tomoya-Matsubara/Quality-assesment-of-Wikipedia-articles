'''HMS ''Pomone''''' was a {{sclass|Pelorus|cruiser|0}} [[protected cruiser]] built for the [[Royal Navy]] in the late 1890s. The ship's boilers were so troublesome that she was [[Ship decommissioning|decommissioned]] in 1904 after only a single foreign deployment. She was [[hulk (ship)|hulk]]ed in 1910 and served as a stationary training ship until 1922 when she was sold for [[ship breaking|scrap]].

==Design and description==
These "Third class" cruisers were designed by [[William Henry White|Sir William White]]. While well armed for their size, they were  primarily workhorses for the overseas fleet on "police" duties and were not intended to serve with the main battlefleet. This class served as testbeds for a variety of [[water-tube boiler]] designs and those used by ''Pomone'' were so unsatisfactory that the ship was decommissioned after only five years of service.<ref name=bc/>

HMS ''Pomone'' displaced {{convert|2135|LT|MT|lk=on}}, with an overall length of {{convert|313|ft|6|in|m|1}}, a beam of {{convert|36|ft|6|in|m|1}} and a draft of {{convert|16|ft|m|1}}. She was powered by two inverted 3-cylinder [[Marine steam engine#Triple or multiple expansion|vertical triple-expansion steam engines]], each driving one propeller shaft. Steam was supplied by 16 coal-fired Blechynden water-tube boilers. The engines were intended to develop a maximum of {{convert|7000|ihp|lk=on}} under forced draft, but developed a total of {{convert|7340|ihp|lk=on}} during her [[sea trial]]s and gave a maximum speed of {{convert|20.8|kn|lk=on}}. The ship had a crew complement of 224 men.<ref name=bc>British Cruiser Pomone and Sisterships, pp. 321<U+2013>22</ref>

''Pomone'' was armed with eight single [[QF 4 inch naval gun Mk I - III|QF 4&nbsp;inch (102&nbsp;mm) guns]], eight [[QF 3 pounder Hotchkiss|QF 3-pounder gun]]s, three machine guns, and two 18&nbsp;inch (457&nbsp;mm) torpedo tubes. Her protective [[deck (ship)|deck]] ranged from {{convert|1.5|to|2|in}} in thickness and the ship had a [[conning tower]] with walls {{convert|3|in|0}} thick. The four-inch guns were protected by [[gun shield]]s {{convert|.25|in|1}} thick.<ref>Gardiner, p. 83</ref>

==Service==
HMS ''Pomone'' was laid down at [[Sheerness Dockyard]] on 21 December 1896, launched on 25 November 1897, and completed in May 1899. The ship only served a single commission, with the [[East Indies Station|East Indies Squadron]] and suffered from continuous boiler problems.<ref name=BCP&S321/> In November and December 1903, ''Pomone'' and three other cruisers escorted [[Lord Curzon]]'s tour of the Middle East.<ref>Fraser, p. 110</ref> Her Blechynden boilers were so unreliable that she was removed from the effective list in October 1904 when [[John Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher|Admiral Lord Fisher]] started disposing of ineffective ships upon becoming [[First Sea Lord]]. She was [[Wikt:mothball|laid-up]] pending a decision on her final disposal. ''Pomone'' was disarmed and [[hulk (ship)|hulk]]ed on 5 January 1910 as a stationary training ship for engineers at the [[Royal Naval College, Dartmouth]]. She was sold for scrap on 25 October 1922 to J. H. Lee of [[Dover]].<ref name=BCP&S321>British Cruiser Pomone and Sisterships, p. 321</ref>
