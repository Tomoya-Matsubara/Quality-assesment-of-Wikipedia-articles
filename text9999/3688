'''Ryan Martinez''' (born August 27, 1987) is an [[United States|American]] [[Mixed martial arts|mixed martial artist]] who competes in [[Bellator Fighting Championships|Bellator]]'s [[Heavyweight (MMA)|heavyweight]] division.

==Background==
Martinez was born in [[Greeley, Colorado]]. He grew up [[wrestling]] and had a very promising future, being a top ranked wrestler in the state of Colorado (third in the country as a senior) while at [[Greeley West High School]], and a two-time [[All-American]]. The young Martinez was offered full-scholarships from many different colleges, but began getting involved with drugs and alcohol, and eventually dropped out of high school as he began dealing drugs.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

Martinez was addicted to [[methamphetamines]] and was arrested once for [[drug trafficking]]. He spent three and a half years in [[prison]] and two years on [[parole]]. The time in prison was especially hard on Martinez because he missed the first two years of his daughter Taylor's life.

After his time in prison, he got a job as an [[ironworker]] and started to train [[Mixed martial arts|MMA]], which helped him to overcome his past.<ref>[http://www.mmajunkie.com/news/2013/03/bellator-93s-ryan-martinez-on-new-path-after-years-spend-behind-bars Bellator 93's Ryan Martinez on new path after years spent behind bars] by Matt Erickson (MMAjunkie.com) on March 21, 2013</ref>
