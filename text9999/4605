A '''hyrax''' (from Greek {{polytonic|<U+1F51><U+03C1><U+03B1><U+03BE>}} 'shrewmouse'; [[Afrikaans]]: '''klipdassie''', from [[Dutch language|Dutch]]: '''klipdas''' 'rockbadger') is any of four [[species]] of fairly small, thickset, herbivorous [[mammal]]s in the [[order (biology)|order]] '''Hyracoidea'''. They live in [[Africa]] and the [[Middle East]]. 

Hyraxes are well-furred rotund creatures with a mere stump for a tail. They are about the size of a [[Welsh Corgi|Corgi]]; most measure between about 30 and 70 cm long and weigh between 2 and 5 kg. From a distance, a hyrax could be mistaken for a very well-fed [[rabbit]] or [[guinea pig]]. 

==Characteristics==
[[Image:Tree-hyrax.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Tree Hyrax in the [[Serengeti]], [[Tanzania]]]]
Hyraxes retain a number of early mammal characteristics; in particular they have poorly developed internal temperature regulation (which they deal with by huddling together for warmth, and by basking in the sun like reptiles). Unlike other browsing and grazing animals, they do not use the  [[incisor]]s at the front of the jaw for slicing off leaves and grass, and use the [[molar (tooth)|molar]] teeth at the side of the jaw instead.  The incisors are none the less large, and grow continuously through life, in a similar manner to those of [[rodent]]s. There is a short [[diastema (dentistry)|diastema]] between the incisors and the cheek teeth. The [[dentition|dental formula]] for hyraxes is:{{dentition2|1.0.4.3|2.0.4.3}}

Unlike the [[even-toed ungulate]]s and some of the [[macropod]]s, hyraxes do not chew cud to help extract nutrients from coarse, low-grade leaves and grasses. They do, however, have complex, multi-chambered stomachs which allow symbiotic bacteria to break down tough plant materials, and their overall ability to digest fibre is similar to that of the ungulates.

Hyraxes inhabit rocky terrain across sub-Saharan [[Africa]]. Their feet have rubbery pads with numerous sweat glands, which help the animal maintain its grip when moving fast up steep rocky surfaces. They also have efficient [[kidney]]s, retaining water so that they can survive in arid environments.

Female hyraxes give birth to up to four young after a [[gestation]] period of between seven and eight months, depending on the species. The young are [[weaning|weaned]] at one to five months of age, and reach sexual maturity at sixteen to seventeen months.

Hyraxes live in small family groups, dominated by a single male who aggressively defends the territory from rivals. Where there is abundant living space, the male may dominate multiple groups of females, each with their own range. The remaining males live solitary lives, often on the periphery of areas controlled by larger males, and mate only with younger females<ref name=EoM>{{cite book |editor=Macdonald, D.|author= Hoeck, Hendrik|year=1984 |title= The Encyclopedia of Mammals|publisher= Facts on File|location=New York|pages= 462-465|isbn= 0-87196-871-1}}</ref>

==Historical accounts==
[[Image:Klipdas.jpg|thumb|right|250px]]
Early [[Phoenicia]]n navigators mistook the rabbits of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] for hyraxes ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] ''Shaphan''); hence they named it ''I-Shapan-im'', meaning "land of the hyraxes", which ''possibly'' became the Latin word "[[Hispania]]", the root of [[Spain]]'s modern Spanish name ''Espa<U+00F1>a'' and the English name ''Spain''.

The word "rabbit, or "hare" was used instead of "hyrax" many times in some earlier English Bible translations. European translators of those times had no knowledge of the hyrax ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] {{IPA|<U+05E9><U+05B8><U+05BC><U+05C1><U+05E4><U+05B8><U+05DF>}} ''Shaphan''<ref>[http://www.htmlbible.com/sacrednamebiblecom/kjvstrongs/FRMSTRHEB82.htm#S8227 "Shaphan" in ''Strong's Concordance'']</ref>), and therefore no name for them. There are references to hyraxes in the [[Old Testament]]<ref>[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lev+11:4-8;Dt+14:7;Ps+104:18;Pr+30:26 Lev 11:4-8; Deut 14:7; Ps 104:18; Prov 30:26]</ref> which describe hyraxes and rabbits as [[cud|cud-chewing]] animals. They are not [[ruminant|true cud chewers]], but rather [[coprophagy|coprophages]]. After eating, they [[ferment]] and partially [[digest]] their food; their [[cecum]] plays a similar role in this process to a cow's [[rumen]]. After passing this partially-digested food, they re-ingest it and complete the digestive process. Once digestion is complete, they pass feces of a different texture which they do not re-ingest.

==Evolution==
Hyraxes are sometimes described as the closest living relative of the elephant. This is because they may share an ancestor in the distant past when hyraxes were larger and more diverse. However, the details of their relationship remain open to debate.

All modern hyraxes are members of the family '''Procaviidae''' (the only living family within the Hyracoidea) and are found only in [[Africa]] and the [[Middle East]]. In the past, however, hyraxes were more diverse and widespread. The order first appears in the [[fossil]] record over 40 million years ago, and for many millions of years hyraxes were the primary terrestrial herbivore in Africa, just as [[odd-toed ungulate]]s were in the [[Americas]]. There were many different species, the largest of them about the weight of a small horse, the smallest the size of a mouse. During the [[Miocene]], however, competition from the newly-developed [[bovid]]s<U+2014>very efficient grazers and browsers<U+2014>pushed the hyraxes out of the prime territory and into marginal niches. Nevertheless, the order remained widespread, diverse and successful as late as the end of the [[Pliocene]] (about two million years ago) with representatives throughout most of Africa, [[Europe]] and [[Asia]].

The descendants of the giant hyracoids evolved in different ways. Some became smaller, and gave rise to the modern hyrax family. Others appear to have taken to the water (perhaps like the modern [[capybara]]), and ultimately gave rise to the elephant family, and perhaps also the [[Sirenian]]s (dugongs and manatees). DNA evidence supports this theory, and the small modern hyraxes share numerous features with elephants, such as [[toenail]]s, excellent hearing, sensitive pads on their feet, small [[tusk]]s, good memory, high brain functions compared to other similar mammals, and the shape of some of their [[bone]]s.<ref>"Hyrax: The Little Brother of the Elephant", ''Wildlife on One'', BBC TV.</ref>

Not all scientists support the contention that hyraxes are the closest living relative of the elephant. Recent morphological and molecular based classifications reveal the [[Sirenian]]s to be the closest living relatives of elephants, while hyraxes are closely related but form an [[outgroup]] to the assemblage of elephants, sirenians, and extinct orders like [[Embrithopoda]] and [[Desmostylia]].<ref name=Asher>{{cite journal | author = Asher, R.J., Novacek, M.J., Geisher, J.H.| year = 2003 | title = Relationships of endemic African mammals and their fossil relatives based on morphological and molecular evidence | journal = J. Mamm. Evol. | volume = 10 | pages = 131-194}}</ref>.

==Living species==
Scientists have recently [[lumpers and splitters|reduced]] the number of distinct species of hyrax recognized. While as recently as 1995 there were eleven or more recognized species, there are only four recognized today. The remaining species are regarded as subspecies of the remaining four. In fact, there are over 50 recognized species and subspecies, though many are considered highly endangered.<ref name=MSW3>{{MSW3 Shoshani|pages=87-89}}</ref>
