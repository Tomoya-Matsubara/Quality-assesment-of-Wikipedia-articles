'''Walpole Old Chapel''' is a redundant chapel in Halesworth Road, [[Walpole, Suffolk|Walpole]], [[Suffolk]], England.  Originally a farmhouse, it was converted into a chapel in the 17th&nbsp;century.  It continued in use into the 20th&nbsp;century but closed in 1970.  It is now administered by the [[List of chapels preserved by the Historic Chapels Trust|Historic Chapels Trust]].

==History==

The building originated as a farmhouse in the late 16th century.  In the middle of the 17th century a group of [[Independent (religion)|Independent]] Christians was meeting in the nearby village of Cookley.  Following the passing of the [[Act of Toleration 1689|Act of Toleration]] in 1689, which gave the right of freedom of worship to [[Nonconformism|Nonconformists]], six trustees from the group took out a lease on the building and the surrounding {{convert|1|acre}} of land, and converted the farmhouse into a chapel.<ref name=hist>{{Citation | url = http://www.walpoleoldchapel.co.uk/History.htm | title = How a Suffolk Farmhouse became a Chapel | accessdate = 29&nbsp;June 2010 | publisher = Walpole Old Chapel}}</ref>  In about 1700 an extension was added to the back of the building.<ref name=images>{{Citation |url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=286148 |title=Images of England: Congregational Chapel, Walpole |publisher=[[English Heritage]] | accessdate= 29&nbsp;June 2010}}</ref>  Over the years attendance at the chapel declined, this not being helped by the establishment of an Independent chapel in the nearby town of [[Halesworth]].  In the 1860s the building, by then a [[Congregational church|Congregational]] chapel, was taken over by [[Primitive Methodism|Primitive Methodists]].  Numbers continued to decline during the 20th&nbsp;century, and in 1958 the trusteeship was passed to the Suffolk Congregational Union, the chapel finally closing in 1970.  The building remained unused, and in 1995 it came into the care of the Historic Chapels Trust.<ref name=hist/>

==Architecture and furnishings==

The chapel has been designated by [[English Heritage]] as a Grade II* [[listed building]].  It is [[timber framing|timber framed]] with some brick casing in the left-hand [[gable]].  The exterior is [[Stucco|plastered]] and the roof is tiled.  The entrance face contains two doors.<ref name=images/>  The interior is dominated by the [[pulpit]] opposite the doors, and the main light for the chapel comes from round-arched windows, one on each sire of the pulpit.<ref name=hct>{{Citation | url = http://www.hct.org.uk/chapels/east-england/walpole-old-chapel/23#field-chapel-history-arch | title = Walpole Old Chapel | accessdate = 29&nbsp;June 2010 | publisher = [[Historic Chapels Trust]]}}</ref>  The pulpit is hexagonal and is raised, with a reading desk at a lower level in front of it.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.walpoleoldchapel.co.uk/Inside.htm | title = Inside the chapel| 29&nbsp;June 2010 | publisher = Walpole Old Chapel}}</ref>  Over the pulpit is a hexagonal [[Canopy (building)|canopy]] with an [[ogee]] roof and a ball [[finial]].<ref name=hct/>  The roof is supported by three circular timber columns.  On three sides, opposite the pulpit and on the side walls, is a tiered gallery.  The floor is brick.  On the ground floor are eleven [[box pew]]s; elsewhere on the ground floor and in the gallery seating is provided on benches.
