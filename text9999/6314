'''George Elyott Dement, Jr.''' (January 23, 1922 <U+2013> January 12, 2014),<ref name=dementdeath/> was an American [[innkeeper]] and restauranteur who served from 1989 to 2005 as the twelfth [[mayor]] of [[Bossier City, Louisiana|Bossier City]], [[Louisiana]].<ref name=bpress>{{cite web|url=http://www.bossierpress.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=9403:mr-bossier-turns-91&catid=1:local-news&Itemid=134|title=Amanda Crane, "'Mr. Bossier' turns 91"|publisher=''[[Bossier Press-Tribune]]''|accessdate=February 3, 2013}}</ref>

==Background==

Dement's parents were George Dement, Sr., and the former Clara Catherine Depew. Employed by [[Gulf Oil]], the senior Dement relocated in 1919 from [[Missouri]] to [[Bossier Parish, Louisiana|Bossier Parish]] in northwestern Louisiana. When Clara was giving birth to George, Jr., with the assistance of a [[midwife]], a mule crawled under their old farmhouse in the [[Princeton, Louisiana|Princeton]] community in search of corn. The creature tried to stand and shook the floor while the baby was being brought forward.<ref name=byrd>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=YUoQfZ2nJKUC&pg=PA211&lpg=PA211&dq=George+Dement's+parents+in+Bossier+Parish&source=bl&ots=hWEdOH9bCM&sig=al55AfVlY4nbL6MNZYV7EbsOykg&hl=en&sa=X&ei=DOoNUd6SCKHg2gWM1IDwBg&ved=0CE8Q6AEwBjgU#v=onepage&q=George%20Dement's%20parents%20in%20Bossier%20Parish&f=false|title=Jerry Byrd, The Boy Who Broke Lou Gehrig's Record, pp. 210-213|publisher=[[Bloomington, Indiana]]: AuthorHouse, 2008, ISBN 978-1-4343-8700-4|accessdate=February 3, 2013}}</ref>

Dement went to [[Arizona]] a year before he graduated from Elm Grove High School (pronounced ELEM Grove) in Bossier Parish. He then earned a dollar a day as a delivery boy for a Bossier City drugstore. Soon he was nearing completion of officer candidacy school in [[Corpus Christi, Texas|Corpus Christi]], [[Texas]], when he had a dispute with a lieutenant. Outraged, he joined the [[submarine]] section of the [[United States Navy]] during [[World War II]]. Though his submarine, the ''[[USS Razorback (SS-394)]]'', did not enter service until 1944, it participated in five combat patrols in the [[Pacific Theater of Operations]]. Dement was a member of the first crew of the ''Razorback'', on which he worked as a cook. During a surface attack, he once mistakenly left oil in a fryer that began to smoke. This forced the boat to rise to the surface in enemy waters in daylight.<ref name=dementdeath/> The ''Razorback'' was nearly the last casualty of the Pacific war.<ref name=byrd/> Dement was present for the ceremony on [[Victory over Japan Day]], September 2, 1945, when the [[Empire of Japan]], under [[Hirohito|Emperor Hirohito]] surrendered to [[General]] [[Douglas MacArthur]] at [[Tokyo Bay]]. In 2004, the ''Razorback'' was moved to [[North Little Rock, Arkansas|North Little Rock]], [[Arkansas]], as a display vessel, and Dement was there for the ceremony.<ref name=dementdeath/>
 
After five years in the military, Dement attended [[Methodist]]-affiliated [[Centenary College of Louisiana|Centenary College]] in [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]]. At one time or another, Dement owned and operated fourteen restaurants in the Bossier City area, including "The Doghouse," where [[Elvis Presley]] ate in 1954, when he came to the [[Shreveport Municipal Auditorium]] for the ''[[Louisiana Hayride]]''.<ref name=byrd/> His restaurant business actually originated while he was in the Navy. He sent his bride-to-be $70 per month, enough to allow her to open their first restaurant, "George's Big Boy", across from the [[Strand Theatre (Shreveport, Louisiana)|Strand Theatre]] in Shreveport. The outlet served foot-long hot dogs, [[Po' boy]] sandwiches, homemade chili, and apple pies.<ref name=gdementobit>{{cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/shreveporttimes/obituary.aspx?n=george-dement&pid=169083471&fhid=10232#sthash.INnZC6R3.dpuf|title=George Dement obituary|publisher=''The Shreveport Times''|accessdate=January 14, 2014}}</ref> By the late 1960s, faced with fast-food chain establishments in competition with his home-owned restaurants, Dement switched to hotels. He took over the management of a new [[Holiday Inn]] in Bossier City. Twice he was designated "Innkeeper of the World" for his work.<ref name=gdementobit/><ref name=vitter/>

==Political career==

In 1989, Dement was elected mayor as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], when the incumbent [[Don Jones (Louisiana politician)|Donald Edward Jones]], a former national president of the [[Junior Chamber International]] and a Bossier City businessman, did not seek reelection. Dement won second, third, and fourth terms in 1993, 1997, and in 2001. He retired on June 30, 2005, exactly sixteen years from his original inauguration into office. He was known for his leadership and accessibility to the public. He pushed for the Louisiana Boardwalk in downtown Bossier City and worked to revitalize key areas of the city. Dement worked to increase the size of both the police and fire departments, to place computers and cameras in police vehicles, and to establish four new fire stations.<ref name=gdementobit/> He established an improved relationship between the city and [[Barksdale Air Force Base]]. Retired Brig. Gen. Peyton Cole said that when he arrived at Barksdale in 1992, there was "some space" between the citizens of Bossier City and the resident airmen. Dement, however, worked to strengthen municipal ties to the air base.

According to the ''Bossier Press-Tribune'', Dement "embraced riverboat gaming" which brought to Bossier City three casinos with the revenue to build the [[CenturyLink Center]], Arthur Ray Teague Parkway,<ref name=vitter/> and the Benton Road Overpass. The leg work for some of the projects had begun in the Jones administration.

In 2005, [[U.S. Senator]] [[David Vitter]], a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], paid tribute to Dement as "the people's mayor" on the occasion of Dement's retirement from office. Dement was succeeded by a former opponent, the Democrat-turned-Republican [[Lo Walker]], who still holds the position, the first Republican in the seat.<ref name=vitter>{{cite web|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2005-06-07/html/CREC-2005-06-07-pt1-PgS6152-2.htm|title=Tribute to George Dement, Mayor of Bossier City, Louisiana|publisher=''Congressional Record''|accessdate=February 2, 2013}}</ref> Prior to his own election to the office, Walker was the city's chief administrative officer and executive assistant to Mayor Dement.<ref name=zoominfo/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ktbs.com/news/Lo-Walker-to-seek-third-term-as-Bossier-City-mayor/-/144844/10277104/-/q0klll/-/index.html|title=Lo Walker to seek third term as Bossier City mayor, April 12, 2012|publisher=[[KTBS-TV]]|accessdate=February 3, 2013}}</ref>

In the [[nonpartisan blanket primary]] held on April 1, 1989, Dement led his three opponents with 4,845 votes (39.4 percent). The second-place candidate, fellow Democrat Wands S. Bennett, trailed with 3,405 votes (27.7 percent). Two other contenders, Democrat Lo Walker and Republican David H. Broussard followed with 2,072 votes (16.9 percent) and 1,978 votes (16.1 percent), respectively.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://staticresults.sos.la.gov/04011989/04011989_08.html|title=Primary election returns, April 1, 1989|publisher=staticresults.sos.la.gov|accessdate=February 2, 2013}}</ref> In the second round of balloting four weeks later, Dement narrowly prevailed, 7,091 (51.8 percent) to Bennett's 6,596 (48.2 percent).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://staticresults.sos.la.gov/04291989/04291989_08.html|title=General election returns, April 29, 1989|publisher=staticresults.sos.la.gov|accessdate=February 2, 2013}}</ref>

When Dement left office, the Mayor George Dement Endowed Fund for Bossier was established in his honor.<ref name=zoominfo>{{cite web|url=http://www.zoominfo.com/#!search/profile/person?personId=37183646&targetid=profile|title=George Dement|publisher=zoominfo.com|accessdate=February 3, 2013}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Dement was married to the former Sunshine Norris (1924-2011), a Shreveport native and one of two daughters of Steve Norris, a [[Bossier Parish]] sheriff's deputy, and the former Avis Wasson. Sunshine was homecoming queen at Bossier High School in 1942, when the players won the state football championship. She graduated in 1945 and like her husband attended [[Centenary College of Louisiana|Centenary College]], where she obtained a bachelor's degree in education. She taught for twenty years for the [[Bossier Parish School Board]] at Bossier Elementary School and then became the first physical education teacher at Greenacres Junior High School in Bossier City.<ref name=sunshine>{{cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/shreveporttimes/obituary.aspx?n=sunshine-norris-dement&pid=148435633#fbLoggedOut|title=Sunshine Norris Dement|publisher=''The Shreveport Times'', February 7, 2011|accessdate=February 2, 2013}}</ref>

George Dement met Sunshine when he was working as a [[soda jerk]] for $19 a week in a drug store. After the war, he was a higher-paid bartender, but Sunshine insisted that he leave that job, join the First [[Baptist]] Church of Bossier City, and enroll at Centenary College.<ref name=byrd/> The two somehow concealed their marriage for a year out of fear that Steve Norris would question George's ability to support a wife. Throughout his career in business and politics, Sunshine, was always by his side and was an active "First Lady" of Bossier City for the sixteen years that he was mayor.<ref name=sunshine/>

Dement resides at his family farm, original Norris property, near [[Frierson, Louisiana|Frierson]] in [[DeSoto Parish, Louisiana|DeSoto Parish]], within the [[Shreveport-Bossier City metropolitan area]].<ref name=sunshine/> Dement has three sons, Steve G. Dement (born 1950), Walter Edward Dement (born 1952), and Timothy Lee "Tim" Dement, all of Frierson, a daughter,  Ann Dement Montes, a minister from [[Bossier City]], six grandchildren, and ten great-grandchildren.<ref name=sunshine/>

Dement had a brief [[boxing]] career in the Navy, and three of his sons won boxing titles. [[Tim Dement]], at the age of seventeen, was a contestant at the [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972 Olympic Games]] in [[Munich]], [[Germany]].<ref name=byrd/> He upset Bobby Hunter in the flyweight competition (105 <U+2013> 112 pounds). ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' described Tim as "a pale, dreamy looking boy of 17 with no indication of any strength." Over the years Tim Dement has trained amateur boxers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://965kvki.com/tim-dement-bossier-city-munich-games-72/|title=Tim Dement, Bossier City: Munich Games '72|publisher=965kvki.com|accessdate=February 2, 2013}}</ref> Tim Dement is a former Bossier City police detective who investigated cases of sexual predators involved in youth sports.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shreveporttimes.com/assets/pdf/D95065625.PDF|title=Brian Vernellis, "Keeping sexual predators out of youth sports|publisher=''Shreveport Times'', June 26, 2005|accessdate=February 2, 2013}}</ref>

Another son, David Glenn Dement, died in 2006 at the age of fifty-two; he was a co-founder of [[GLAAD]], an [[AIDS]] education and prevention group formed in 1980.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boonefh.com/sitemaker/sites/BooneF1/obit.cgi?user=491_DDement65|title=David Glenn Dement|publisher=boonefh.com|accessdate=February 2, 2013}}</ref>

==Dement's legacy==
In 2003, Dement was awarded an honorary doctorate for outstanding service by his [[Alma mater]], Centenary College.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.centenary.edu/news/2003/April/03hondocs.html|title=Centenary College of Louisiana to Award Honorary Doctorates to Mayor George Dement, Bishop William Hutchinson, and Musician/Commentator Miles Hoffman|publisher=centenary.edu|accessdate=February 3, 2013}}</ref>

In 2012, he completed his [[autobiography]] entitled ''George Dement: I will, If you will, Saith the Lord,'' available through [[Sarah Hudson-Pierce]]'s Ritz Publications, with an introduction by former [[governor of Louisiana|Governor]] [[Edwin Edwards]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ktbs.com/news/Former-Bossier-City-Mayor-holds-book-signing/-/144844/15439588/-/gu8y2x/-/index.html|title=Former Bossier City Mayor holds book signing, July 7, 2011|publisher=[[KTBS-TV]]|accessdate=February 3, 2013}}</ref>

On February 2, 2013, Dement, along with [[Leonard R. "Pop" Hataway]], the former [[sheriff]] of [[Grant Parish, Louisiana|Grant Parish]], [[Political consulting|political consultant]] [[Angelo Roppolo]] of Shreveport, and the late [[Louisiana State Senate|State Senator]] [[Charles C. Barham]] of [[Ruston, Louisiana|Ruston]] and later Shreveport, was among those inducted into the [[Louisiana Political Museum and Hall of Fame]] in [[Winnfield, Louisiana|Winnfield]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://avoyellestoday.com/view/full_story/21081658/article-LOUISIANA-POLITICAL-MUSEUM-HALL-OF-FAME-TO-INDUCT-6-in-2013|title=Louisiana Political Museum Hall of Fame to Induct six in 2013|publisher=''Avoyelles Today''|accessdate=February 2, 2013}}</ref>

Mayor Lo Walker summed up the contributions of his predecessor:

<blockquote>
It's fair to say that, during his administration, there was tremendous progress made, and positive things started ... George Dement was extremely well known <U+2014> recognition is very important in politics. And not only was he well known, he was well liked. He recognized talent and he was able to put together a field of good people to be in charge of the key areas. I might add, he hired me at that time. But he also selected the most well-qualified people and, basically, stepped aside and let them do their jobs, and they did it well.<ref name=dementlegacy>{{cite web|url=http://www.shreveporttimes.com/article/20140114/NEWS01/301150024/George-Dement-set-pace-Bossier-City-s-future|title=George Dement set pace for Bossier City's future, January 14, 2014|publisher=''The Shreveport Times''|accessdate=January 15, 2014}}</ref></blockquote>
