"'''Born This Way'''" is a song by American recording artist [[Lady Gaga]], from her second studio album, ''[[Born This Way]]''. Written and produced by Gaga, [[Fernando Garibay]], [[Jeppe Laursen]] and DJ White Shadow, "Born This Way" was developed while Gaga was on the road with [[The Monster Ball Tour]]. Inspired by the 1990s empowering music for women and the [[gay community]], Gaga explained that "Born This Way" was her freedom song. Previously, she had sung part of the [[refrain|chorus]] at the [[2010 MTV Video Music Awards]] in 2010. The song was announced as the [[single (music)|lead single]] from the album, and was released on February 11, 2011<U+2014>two days prior to its scheduled date<U+2014>along side the release of the full set of lyrics and the single artwork.

Musically "Born This Way" is an [[electropop]] song, backed by rumbling synth sounds and a humming bass, with a [[percussion]] added in the chorus. It also includes Gaga singing [[a capella]] near the end with an [[organ (music)|organ]] added. The lyrics of the song talk about self-empowerment and feature the names of LGBT communities like gay, lesbian and transgender, amongst others. The usage of the terms "[[cholo|chola]]" and "[[orient]]" in the song drew criticism from some Asian and Hispanic communities, who claimed that the terms had been used in an offensive and derogatory manner. The song was treated with different remixes, including a Country Road version recorded by Gaga herself, and another by Indian music producer duo [[Salim-Sulaiman|Salim and Sulaiman Merchant]].

"Born This Way" received mixed reception from critics; it was complimented for being a "club-ready anthem", while faced criticism for having similarities with [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s 1989 single "[[Express Yourself (Madonna song)|Express Yourself]]". Some reviewers surmised that the similarities would damage the song's appeal, others felt that "Born This Way" was nonetheless a completely separate piece of work. The song reached number one in 19&nbsp;countries, including Australia, Austria, Canada, Germany, Ireland, Japan, New Zealand, Switzerland and Sweden. In the United States, it became her third single to top the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart. Additionally, "Born This Way" became the 1000th number-one song on the Hot 100, spending a total of six weeks atop the chart. It became the fastest-selling song in [[iTunes]] history, selling one million copies in five days.

The accompanying [[music video]] for the song was directed by [[Nick Knight (photographer)|Nick Knight]] and Gaga herself. It was inspired by painters like [[Salvador Dal<U+00ED>]] and [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]], and their [[surrealism|surrealistic]] images. The main idea behind the video is Gaga giving birth to a new race, which is shown with the help of a prologue. After the song starts and a series of dance sequences later, the video concludes with the view of a city populated by this race. Critics noted the video for its cultural references and artistic similarities to the work of [[Michael Jackson]], Madonna and late fashion designer [[Alexander McQueen]], as well as to [[Greek mythology]] and surrealism. "Born This Way" was first performed at the [[53rd Grammy Awards]], where Gaga sang it after coming out of an incubating vessel. The song was also performed during the last leg of The Monster Ball Tour and in television shows like ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' and ''[[Good Morning America]]''. Singers [[Katy Perry]] and [[Maria Aragon]] have covered the song.

==Background==
{{Quote box|width=30%|align=right|quote="The nexus of 'Born This Way' and the soul of the record reside in this idea that you were not necessarily born in one moment. You have your entire life to birth yourself into becoming the ultimate potential vision that you see for you. Who you are when you come out of your mother's womb is not necessarily who you will become. 'Born This Way' says your birth is not finite, your birth is infinite."|source=<U+2014>Gaga talking about the meaning of "Born This Way".<ref name="bbcover"/>

In 2010, [[Lady Gaga]] was touring for her second world tour, [[The Monster Ball Tour|The Monster Ball]]. At that time she started developing ideas for her second studio album, ''[[Born This Way]]''.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sheffield|first=Don|title=Lady Gaga: An Intimate Story|date=2010-08-09|work=Rolling Stone|publisher=Jann Wenner|volume=1190|issue=39|page=70|issn=0032-791X}}</ref> The first song written and recorded for the album was the title track itself, described by Gaga as a "magical message" song.

"We recorded it around the world, on the road, in whatever was available. It sounds like it reads, but not like you think until you hear it," he added.<ref name="white">{{cite news|url=http://ca.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idCATRE71408Y20110205?sp=true|title=Lady Gaga Collaborator Talks 'Born This Way' Album|last=Lipschultz|first=Jason|date=2011-02-04|accessdate=2011-02-12|work=Billboard|publisher=Prometheus Global Media}}</ref> Gaga wanted to record her own freedom song, and explained with ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' her inspiration behind the song:
<blockquote>
"<!-- I want to write my this-is-who-the-fuck-I-am anthem, but I don't want it to be hidden in poetic wizardry and metaphors. I want it to be an attack, an assault on the issue because I think, especially in today's music, everything gets kind of washy sometimes and the message gets hidden in the lyrical play. -->Harkening back to the early '90s, when [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[En Vogue]], [[Whitney Houston]] and [[TLC (band)|TLC]] were making very empowering music for women and the gay community and all kind of disenfranchised communities, the lyrics and the melodies were very poignant and very gospel and very spiritual and I said, 'That's the kind of record I need to make. That's the record that's going to shake up the industry.' It's not about the track. It's not about the production. It's about the song. Anyone could sing 'Born This Way'. It could've been anyone."<ref name="bbcover">{{cite news|title=Lady Gaga 'Born This Way' Cover Story|url=http://www.billboard.com/news/lady-gaga-born-this-way-cover-story-1005041172.story|last=Werde|first=Bill|date=2011-04-18|accessdate=2011-04-20|work=Billboard|publisher=Prometheus Global Media|page=4}}</ref>
</blockquote>
On the  43rd episode of her web video series, ''Transmission Gagavision'', Gaga told the interviewer that the greatest challenge she faced while writing "Born This Way" was how she could leave her insecurities behind her, and become confident. "'Born This Way' is who I am. An artist in a constant state of half-fantasy/half-reality at all times," she added.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1379062/Looks-like-horns-spreading--Now-Lady-Gaga-horned-shoulders.html|title=Looks like those horns are spreading...

"It's been such a big track, it's been very popular, and when you consider the style, it's very aggressive. It's got all the stuff that's required to make it a nice clubby track, so for us, the most important thing was: How do you get it into a zone where it's palpable to the Indian flavor?

Salim said that he sang a little bit of [[Indian classical music|alaap]] to give the remix a [[Sufi music|Sufi]] touch, "as that's the kind of music we do and it was also about adding our signature."

Hopefully makes people aware that it's OK to be yourself."<ref name="laurie1"/> According to Gaga, she was inspired by the paintings of [[Salvador Dal<U+00ED>]] and [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]], and their [[surrealism|surrealistic]] images.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lady Gaga Says 'Born This Way' Video Shows 'The Birth Of A New Race'|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1658874/lady-gaga-born-this-way-video.jhtml|publisher=MTV (MTV Networks)|first=Jocelyn|last=Vena|date=2011-02-08|accessdate=2011-03-25}}</ref> Gibson explained the inspiration behind the video to MTV News:
<blockquote>
"When she played it for me, it took me a while to find out the visual interpretation that I could give back to her. And so I woke up one night and I got it, and I said, 'I got it: We have to birth a new race.' From the gate, Gaga was like, 'I want Nick Knight for this video. I want a visual.' She was always birthing something visual in her head, and Nick Knight is just, well, he's prolific but he's so genius. It was about pushing the bar of what a music video should be and can be. [...] It's a different time; it's a different era; there are no limits. It is a viral message. I think that there's something in there for everyone, and that's what's so amazing about the video and so specific about the message."<ref name="laurie1"/>

Gibson recalled having to work with Gaga on her dancing in the video, and to make her a better dancer she wanted Gaga to be confident.<ref name="laurie1">{{cite web|title=Lady Gaga's 'Born This Way' Video, Frame By Frame|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1659008/lady-gaga-born-this-way-video.jhtml|publisher=MTV (MTV Networks)|first=Jocelyn|last=Vena|date=2011-03-01|accessdate=2011-03-25}}</ref> Gaga chose New York to shoot the video because the city is her birth place. Before shooting started, Gibson and Gaga decided there was only one place to work on the avant-garde, modern dance routine for the video, [[Alvin Alley]], where Gibson had studied dance.<ref name="laurie2"/> "We rehearsed there because the choreography is really modern-based. It's, like, more technical than anything she's ever done," she recalled. Shooting also took place in Brooklyn for two days.

===Synopsis===
<!-- PLOT SYNOPSIS DOESNOT NEED REFERENCES PER [[WP:FILMPLOT]] -->
[[File:Bornthiswaymusicvideo.jpg|thumb|221px|left|Gaga (''center'') giving birth to the new race in the music video of "Born This Way".|alt=A blond woman sits with her legs outstretched and her head tilted back. She is dressed in white billowing cloth and many jewelry. The woman is flanked by two brunette girls, who face each other and seem to be pulling out a white circular orb from between the woman's legs. The girls are dressed in identical transparent garments, while a chain connects their bosom. A bluish halo is visible behind the woman and crystalline spiked structure radiate from her back.]]
The music video was released on Monday, February 28, 2011,<ref name="jmont"/> and begins with a brief shot of an [[Unicorn]]'s silhouette in a steam-filled alley, inside a [[pink triangle]] frame. The triangle transitions to a shot of Gaga, with two opposite facing heads, sitting in an ornate glass throne amidst a star-filled space. [[Bernard Herrmann]]<U+2019>s prelude to the movie ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'' plays<ref>{{cite news|url=http://music-mix.ew.com/2011/02/28/lady-gaga-born-this-way-video/|title=Lady Gaga Debuts first 'Born This Way' video|last=Blauvelt|first=Christian|date=2011-02-28|accessdate=2011-06-23|work=Entertainment Weekly|publisher=Time Inc}}</ref> while Gaga declares, "This is the manifesto of Mother Monster," and begins telling the prologue of the video<U+2014>a story of the creation of an extraterrestrial race which "bears no prejudice, no judgment, but boundless freedom." Gaga is shown sitting in the throne above a planet, with her [[Lithotomy position|legs spread apart]], giving birth to a "new race within the race of humanity." As she continues, Gaga explains that the birth of the new race was followed by the birth of evil, due to which Gaga is split in half while being pulled between the two opposing forces of good and evil. Her new half gives birth to an assault rifle and begins to fire it. The prologue concludes with Gaga questioning, "How can I protect something so perfect, without evil?"

As the song begins, numerous people are shown on their hands and knees in a motionless, organized pattern, in a seemingly endless black space. Gaga appears in a black bra and underwear, with shoulder and facial protrusions. She begins walking in an eccentric manner among them with raised hand, before contently nodding her head and crouching on her hands and knees to join them. When the first verse begins, everyone raises their head and begins dancing to elaborate choreography. The scenes alternate between the dance, and Gaga singing on her throne in space. As the second verse begins, Gaga and Rico are both shown wearing tuxedos, with her face painted to mirror his full-body zombie tattoos. Alternating clips show Gaga caressing and attempting to dance with him while he stays expressionless and motionless for the most part. When the chorus plays for the second time, Gaga sings in a room of mirrors, with her head displayed in a glass box among several oddly distorted mannequin heads. In the succeeding shots, she is once again shown on her throne giving birth to more members of the new race. Several more choreographed routines are performed by Gaga and her dancers, and when the song ends, they all gather in a circle and embrace in a hug.

In the video's conclusion, a person's silhouette dances and struts in an alley, a tribute to [[Michael Jackson]]'s "[[The Way You Make Me Feel]]" video.<ref name="slantmusic"/> The silhouette is revealed to be Gaga; her face drastically misconstrued, with sharp horns protruding from her face, glowing eyes, uneven hair, and a distinct Madonna-esque gap between her front teeth.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1361570/Lady-Gaga-Born-This-Way-video-Singer-gives-birth-provocative-new-clip.html |title=Lady Gaga gives birth in her provocative new music video for Born This Way|last=Bambigboye|first=Baz|date=2011-02-28|accessdate=2011-04-22|work=[[Daily Mail]]|publisher=[[Associated Newspapers]]}}</ref> She sheds a single tear as the pink triangle frame appears again, and inside it, a silhouette of Gaga sitting atop the unicorn. A city is seen in the background and a rainbow appears above her, and the final shot is a closeup of Gaga in her zombie makeup, chewing bubble gum and blowing it, as the pink triangle zooms away.

===Reception===

The music video for "Born This Way" was met with mostly positive reception among music critics. James Montgomery of [[MTV]] praised the overall [[creationism]] concept of the music video, adding that it "sort of makes sense, it sort of doesn't, but that 100 percent doesn't really matter much.

Oscar Moralde from [[Slant Magazine]] noted that in the video, "Gaga fully embraces the monstrous as a part of her." Moralde further explained that previously the singer had acknowledged her role as "Mother Monster", but never to the visceral, fully embodied extent that she does in the video. "The things that are monstrous, the things that are different<U+2014>for Gaga, those are the things that are beautiful," he concluded.<ref name="slantmusic">{{cite web|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/house/2011/03/video-review-lady-gagas-born-this-way/|title=Video Review: Lady Gaga's "Born This Way|last=Moralde|first=Oscar|date=2011-03-04|accessdate=2011-04-22|publisher=[[Slant Magazine]]}}</ref> Gina Serpe from [[E!

American singer-songwriter and parodist [["Weird Al" Yankovic]] had sought permission from Gaga to parody "Born This Way", providing a brief description of the concept for his song.
