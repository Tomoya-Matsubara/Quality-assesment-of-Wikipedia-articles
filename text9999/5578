Dr. '''Ismet Popovac''' was a [[Bosnian Muslim]]{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=288}} military commander, politician, physician, and lawyer who led a Muslim Chetnik militia known as the Muslim People's Military Organization ({{lang-sh|''Muslimanska nacionalna vojna organizacija''}}, MNVO) in [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]] and [[Herzegovina]] during [[World War II]]. A former mayor of the Bosnian town of [[Konjic]], he joined the Chetnik movement of [[Dra<U+017E>a Mihailovi<U+0107>]] after the [[Axis invasion of Yugoslavia]] in 1941. As a proponent of Bosnian Muslim collaboration with the Chetniks, Popovac suggested that the Chetniks recruit Muslims into their ranks. In October 1942, he enlisted [[Kingdom of Italy|Italian]] aid in fighting the [[Yugoslav Partisans]], and later visited [[Prozor-Rama|Prozor]] to discourage further bloodshed after a Chetnik massacre took the lives of 543<U+2013>2,500 Muslim and Croat civilians. In early 1943 he led an attack against a Muslim village, before being killed by either the Partisans, Chetniks, or an assassin in the vicinity of the town of [[Trebinje]] later that year.

==Biography==

===Early life===
From the Herzegovinian town of [[Nevesinje]], Ismet Popovac was a physician{{sfn|Red<U+017E>i<U+0107>|2005|p=143}} and lawyer{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=240}} by profession. He finished medical school in [[Belgrade]] and was a vocal supporter of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] during this time.{{sfn|Ko<U+0161>ari<U+0107>|18 August 2013}} Prior to the outbreak of [[World War II]], he was the mayor of the Bosnian town of [[Konjic]]{{sfn|Malcolm|1994|p=188}}{{sfn|Hoare|2007|p=270}} and was allegedly a candidate for [[Vladko Ma<U+010D>ek]]'s electoral list, but was left without a job in the state government after the creation of the [[Banovina of Croatia]].{{sfn|Hoare|2007|p=270}}

===Joining the Chetniks===
On 6 April 1941, [[Axis powers|Axis]] forces [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invaded]] Yugoslavia. Poorly equipped and poorly trained, the [[Royal Yugoslav Army]] was quickly defeated.{{sfn|Cohen|1996|p=28}} The country was then dismembered, and [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]] and [[Herzegovina]] became part of the newly formed [[Independent State of Croatia]] ({{lang-sh|''Nezavisna Dr<U+017E>ava Hrvatska''}}, NDH).{{sfn|Hart|17 February 2011}} That year, Popovac and fellow Muslim leader [[Mustafa Pa<U+0161>i<U+0107>]] joined the [[Chetnik]] movement of [[Dra<U+017E>a Mihailovi<U+0107>]].{{sfn|Hoare|2007|p=270}} Popovac hoped to achieve independence for Bosnia and Herzegovina through his cooperation{{sfn|Burgwyn|2005|p=180}} and, according to one Serb Chetnik, his "main goal was to protect the Muslims, rather than to struggle for the Serb nation and Serb affairs."{{sfn|Hoare|2007|p=270}} He later wrote to Mihailovi<U+0107>, suggesting that [[Bosnian Muslims]] be recruited into the Chetnik ranks.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=137}} This proposal was met with support from pro-Serb, anti-Communist Muslim leaders in several Bosnian towns.{{sfn|Malcolm|1994|p=188}} However, due to [[Chetniks#Terror tactics and cleansing actions|mass atrocities]] carried out by the Chetniks against non-[[Serbs]] in the late spring of 1941, and due to Muslims, especially those in eastern Bosnia, being branded by the Chetniks as "Turks" and "[[Usta<U+0161>e]] cronies," few Muslim recruits were found.{{sfn|Velkonija|2003|p=167}}

===Muslim People's Military Organization===
[[File:Panorama Prozora.JPG|thumb|right|220px|In 1942, Popovac visited the Bosnian town of Prozor to discourage further bloodshed following a Chetnik massacre of Muslim and Croat civilians.]]
In late 1942, a Muslim Chetnik militia known as the Muslim People's Military Organization ({{lang-sh|''Muslimanska nacionalna vojna organizacija''}}, MNVO){{sfn|Christia|2012|p=200}} was formed in Herzegovina.{{sfn|Hoare|2007|p=270}} It was placed under the control of Popovac, [[Fekim Musakadi<U+0107>]] and Mustafa Pa<U+0161>i<U+0107>.{{sfn|Durmanovi<U+0107>|15 November 2006}} Popovac's MNVO were part of a greater Muslim autonomist circle and in September 1942 an assembly of Herzegovinian Muslim notables in Mostar declared: "We Herzegovinians and Bosnians are nobody's property and we recognize the right of nobody to persecute us; so, insofar as our brothers in [[Zagreb]] do not wish to accede to our demands, we shall seek protection of our interests from other big powers from the ranks of our allies."{{sfn|Hoare|2007|p=271}} In October of that year, Popovac enlisted [[Kingdom of Italy|Italian]] aid in fighting the [[Yugoslav Partisans]].{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=494}} This resulted in the establishment of a Bosnian Muslim [[quisling]] force that operated as part of the [[Anti-Communist Volunteer Militia]].{{sfn|Hoare|2007|p=270}} It was reported that he had "won the majority of the Muslims to his purpose" in the [[Mostar]], Konjic, Nevesinje and [[Gacko]] districts.{{sfn|Red<U+017E>i<U+0107>|2005|p=104}} Eventually, he came to be seen as one of "the principal representatives of the pro-Chetnik Muslim current" in Bosnia.{{sfn|Hoare|2007|p=270}}

That October, during [[Operation Alfa]], a joint Chetnik<U+2013>Italian attack against the Partisans, the Chetniks massacred 543<U+2013>2,500 Muslim and Croat civilians in [[Prozor-Rama|Prozor]]. Several days later, Popovac arrived in the town to console the Bosnian Muslim population and to advise the Chetniks there against committing further atrocities.{{sfn|Goldstein|7 November 2012}} While there, he also attempted to convince local Muslims to join the Chetnik ranks, but was unsuccessful due to the extent of Chetnik atrocities against the Muslim population.{{sfn|Dizdar|Sobolevski|1999|p=365}} On 31 December, in face of widespread Muslim opposition to the Chetniks' genocidal nature, Popovac and his MNVO declared a resolution in [[Kalinovik]], vowing allegiance to [[Peter II of Yugoslavia|King Petar II]] and Mihailovi<U+0107>, and claiming Muslims as "an integral part of [[Serbdom]]" and the MNVO as "part of the Chetnik movement led by Dra<U+017E>a Mihailovi<U+0107>, Minister of the Army, Navy and Air Forces."{{sfn|Red<U+017E>i<U+0107>|2005|p=153}}

In January 1943, Popovac led an attack which resulted in the capture of a Muslim village that was guarded by a large force of Muslim volunteers.{{sfn|Malcolm|1994|pp=188 & 309}} That same month more Chetnik massacres against Muslims were carried out, especially in east Bosnia in the areas of [[Koraj]], [[Bijeljina]], [[Srebrenica]], [[Vi<U+0161>egrad]], [[Fo<U+010D>a]], [[Gora<U+017E>de]], [[Vlasenica]], and around the [[Drina]] river.{{sfn|Red<U+017E>i<U+0107>|2005|p=154}} His militia cooperated with Chetnik units in fighting the Partisans during the Axis-led [[Case White]] operation in January to March 1943, but did not distinguish itself.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=494}} During the operation itself Chetniks continued their efforts to exterminate the Muslims. Nonetheless, Popovac and Pa<U+0161>i<U+0107> continued seeking Muslim recruits. They declared in their "Address to the Brethren Muslims of <U+010C>ajni<U+010D>e and Other Nearby Districts" that the main goal of the Chetniks was "the intelligent and honest protection of Muslim interests" and "securing a safe future for our people with the highest principles of [[Islam]]: freedom of religion, holiness of the family, respect for private property, social justice, and democratic political freedom." Furthermore, they dismissed the claim that Muslims were collectively responsible for Usta<U+0161>e crimes and said "Muslims are bound to the brethren of the [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox]] religion by blood and land."{{sfn|Red<U+017E>i<U+0107>|2005|p=154}}

===Death===
Popovac was killed on 21 August 1943.{{sfn|Gobetti|2007|p=165}} Sources vary on the circumstances of his death, with Dr. [[Noel Malcolm]] stating that he was captured by the Partisans and shot,{{sfn|Malcolm|1994|p=188}} Professor [[Jozo Tomasevich]] writing that he was "killed by an assassin,"{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=240}}{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=494}} and Zdravko Dizdar and Mihael Sobolevski claiming that he was killed by the Chetniks in the vicinity of [[Trebinje]] after objecting to the killing of Muslims.{{sfn|Dizdar|Sobolevski|1999|p=365}}

==Legacy==
By December 1943, it was estimated that 4,000 of Mihailovi<U+0107>'s Chetniks were Bosnian Muslims. This number accounted for eight percent of all of Mihailovi<U+0107>'s soldiers.{{sfn|Malcolm|1994|p=188}} In 1944, Mihailovi<U+0107> appealed to the Muslims to fight against the Communists, citing the example of Popovac and other Muslim Chetniks.{{sfn|Radan|Pavkovi<U+0107>|1997|p=221}}
