The '''Ellwood House''' was built as a private home by [[barbed wire]] entrepreneur [[Isaac Ellwood]] in 1879. It is located on First Street in [[DeKalb, Illinois]] in [[DeKalb County, Illinois|DeKalb County]]. The [[Victorian style]] home underwent remodeling in 1898 and 1911 and was originally located on 1,000 [[acres]]. The home contained 36 rooms, including six baths and two wine cellars. Isaac Ellwood lived here until 1910 when he passed the estate to his son, Perry Ellwood. In 1964 the home was donated to the city of DeKalb and converted into a museum.

The house has undergone major renovations throughout its history. After Perry Ellwood inherited the home he [[remodel]]ed the interior and exterior, drastically altering the home's appearance. Thus, the Ellwood House incorporates elements from several architectural styles. The site contains four buildings in addition to the main house. A 50 [[Foot (unit)|foot]] (15.2 [[meter|m]]) tall [[water tower]] dominates the west side of the property while a 14 foot (4.3 m) tall miniature [[Stick style]] house is located nearer the main house. There is also a carriage house, which houses a visitor's center and a museum house that was once used to hold Harriet Ellwood's (Isaac's wife) collection of "curiosities." The house was listed on the U.S. [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1975.

==History==
Construction on the original mansion began in April 1879. George O. Garnsey, a [[Chicago]] architect, designed the Ellwood Mansion for barbed wire [[entrepreneur]] Isaac Ellwood. Garnsey had designed other structures in DeKalb and [[Sycamore, Illinois|Sycamore]]. By November 1879 the Ellwood family occupied the home. Newspaper accounts of the day put the cost somewhere between [[United States dollar|US$]]40,000 and $50,000.<ref name=about/> The home had a number of elements common to [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] designed homes and it combined several styles. Its [[mansard]] roof remains one of the home's most striking features. In addition, the home incorporates [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic]] [[columns]], pitched [[gables]] and a [[cast iron]] roof cresting with a [[trefoil]] design.<ref name=about/>

The first remodeling of the Ellwood Mansion took place as the 19th century drew to a close. The changes, commissioned by [[Isaac Ellwood]], were meant to reflect more popular architectural styles including the [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] and [[Colonial Revival]]. Many of the building's original Gothic features were replaced with more classical elements. On the home's exterior, some of these changes can be found in the addition of the [[portico]] and [[porte-cochere]].<ref name=about/> Inside the home the dining room was enlarged with the addition of the semicircular bay on the homes north facade.

Perry Ellwood inherited the home and together with his wife, May Gurler (associated with [[Gurler House]]), began to alter the mansion once again. The largest changes were the addition of the [[terrace]] on the home's south face, a [[sunroom]] wing and the relocation of the [[porte-cochere]] to the north side of the portico.<ref name=about/> This is the mansion that is visible today. In 1964 the home was donated to the city of DeKalb and converted into a museum.<ref>[http://dig.lib.niu.edu/dekalb/hist-ellwood.html Ellwood House], Wild Prairie Digitization Project Northern Illinois University Library.</ref>

==Architecture==
[[Image:EllwoodHouse5.jpg|thumb|right|The [[dentil]]s are visible in this image of the [[cornice]] that Isaac Ellwood added in 1899.]]
The three-story brick house includes a full elevated basement and a [[mansard roof]] with steeply pitched [[gable]]d [[dormer]]s. Projecting from the roofline are plain corbeled [[chimney]]s and iron gillwork. The original roofing material was [[slate]]. The 1879 version of the Ellwood House featured dormer ornamentation with [[finial]] work. The original windows were all double-hung and of modest size, occurring both singly and in pairs while showing a variety of [[lintel]] designs. The original front (east) facade appeared much different than it does at present. The front entryway has been completely altered, due to Perry Ellwood's 1911 [[remodeling]]. The original entryway featured a one-story stone [[porch]] supported with two [[pilasters]] and two granite [[column]]s. The square projecting porch bay was connected to the ground via 12 stone stairs. In the southeast corner of the house was a full three-story projecting tower set at a 45<U+00B0> angle to the rest of the front facade.<ref name=hild/>
[[Image:EllwoodHouse ten.jpg|thumb|right|The veranda on the south side of the house was one of the 20th century additions by Perry Ellwood.]]
Isaac Ellwood's 1899 renovations were superficial, especially when compared to the alterations his son made to the original design a decade later. He had the [[bracket (architecture)|bracket]]ed [[cornice]] replaced with a Classical cornice with [[dentil]]s and a projecting molding. The window lintels were altered in a similar style to the new cornice. On the tower, the two windows on the first floor were replaced with one larger window while the projecting bay over the east [[portico]] was removed and made flush with the rest of the house. The windows over that portico were replaced with a heavy double door that opened onto the roof over the [[veranda]] which had been built over the entire front of the house. It was during this time that the first [[porte-cochere]] was built on the south side of the home.<ref name=hild/>

Perry Ellwood undertook major renovations which added and changed rooms in 1910. On the home's exterior the porte cochere was moved from the south facade to its present position on the north facade. On the south side of the home a large brick veranda was added and the [[conservatory]] moved from the southwest side of the house to the rear (west). The full-length tower on the home's southwest corner was entirely removed during this renovation.<ref name=hild/>

The general layout of the home's interior has remained basically the same throughout all of the remodelings; the rooms on each floor are accessed via a large central [[hallway]] which ends in an elegant [[rotunda]]. However, some of the changes made in 1910 and 1911 did alter the interior appearance. In the [[living room]], a wall between the sitting room was removed which created a large, open space to which a [[vaulted ceiling]] was added. The [[parlor]] was converted into the [[library]] and the library was converted into the [[dining room]] after an extension was added on. In the home's northwest corner a large [[kitchen]] was added, on the second-floor, the room above the kitchen became servant's quarters.<ref name=hild/>

==Museum==
[[Image:Glidden and Ellwood + Ellwood's wire.jpg|thumb|right|The museum includes a [[barbed wire]] history gallery. The gallery contains authentic examples of early barbed wire.]]
The Ellwood House stands on about 8.5 acres which includes a wooded area to the north of the house. This is all that remains of the original 1,000 acres which the home stood on.<ref name=about>[http://www.northernstar.info/features/ellwood_house/about_the_house.html About the House], ''Ellwood House Association'', 2002. Retrieved [[8 July]] [[2007]].</ref> The house is a museum, operated jointly by the Ellwood House Association and the DeKalb Park District and they offer guided tours for a fee. The museum includes a visitor's center, which includes a [[barbed wire]] gallery, carriage gallery, special exhibits gallery, and a gift shop. The museum offers tourists a chance to glimpse what life was like for the Ellwood's. The home sports crystal [[chandeliers]], gilt mirrors and antique woodwork. The great English living room features a stone fireplace and the dining room features [[mahogany]] paneling. A magnificent [[rotunda]] features a three story [[spiral staircase]] and many bedrooms, servant's rooms and service areas have been restored.<ref name=visitor>[http://www.ellwoodhouse.org/visitor_info/index.html Visitor Information], ''Ellwood House Association'', official site.

==Outbuildings==
[[Image:Ellwood house visitors center.JPG|thumb|right|The [[stucco]] covered carriage house.]]
The Ellwood House grounds hold several extant outbuildings as well: the museum house, the carriage house, the water tower, and the Little House.<ref name=hild>Hild, p. 5.</ref>
On the west (rear) of the Ellwood House, the circular [[limestone]] water tower is about 50 [[Foot (unit)|feet]] (15.2 [[meter|m]]) tall and has a diameter of 18 feet (5.5 m). The tower has windows occurring at different levels, which are [[arch]]ed and include [[keystone]]s in their design. The water tower was built in 1879, the same year as Ellwood House, and at that time the structure was topped with a wooden water tank with a conical roof. Between 1897 and 1910 the wooden tank was removed and replaced with an additional 30 courses of stone which matched the original structure. The arched door at the base of the water tower was replaced with a larger square-shaped double door. The roof remained conical and of wood construction until about 1950 when it was replaced with [[sheet metal]].<ref name=hild2>Hild, p. 6.</ref>

Another of the property's buildings, commonly called the carriage house, never lived up to its popular name. The building never housed any [[carriage]]s; it was, in fact, built to house [[automobile]]s.<ref name=hild2/> The carriage house was constructed sometime between 1908 and 1910 and features a mansard roof. The building is sheathed in [[stucco]] and presently houses a collection of antique carriages and [[sleigh]]s as well as a [[barbed wire]] history museum.<ref name=hild2/><ref name=visitor/>
[[Image:Ellwood House7.jpg|thumb|right|The Little House is dwarfed by the carriage house to its southwest.]]
The one-story red [[brick]] museum house, another of the site's outbuildings, stands to the south of the main house and was built in 1905 for Isaac Ellwood's wife Harriett. She used the building to store the many curiosities and items she collected while traveling throughout the world.<ref name=hild2/> Some of these items included Native American artifacts, minerals, seashells, and other specimens. The Ellwood's grandchildren referred to the museum house as the "Curiosity Shop."<ref name=brauer>Brauer, pp.19-20.</ref> The museum house measures almost exactly 25 feet (7.6 m) on all four sides and has two doorways, one on the east and one on the north side. On its interior some of the museum house's original [[oak]] display cases are still intact.<ref name=hild2/>

On the west (rear) side of the home, near the carriage house, is a miniature [[Stick style]] house known as Little House. Little House is 13 feet (4 m) by 15 feet (4.6 m) and stands 14 feet (4.3 m) above its [[concrete]] foundation. The Little House's roof is an exact [[replica]] of its original roof. Little House was built in 1892 with assistance from every carpenter in DeKalb; the house was to be used as a [[float (parade)|float]] in a local parade. After the parade Isaac Ellwood's son, Will, bought the house and had it placed on the Ellwood House property in the same location it stands today. Between that time and 1973 the house had four or five other owners and it was moved several times. In 1973 the last owner donated Little House to Ellwood House Association and it was returned to its place on the Ellwood property.<ref name=hild3>Hild, pp. 6-7.</ref>

==Significance==
The house is most significant for its connection to Isaac Ellwood, who has been given credit, in part, for [[Joseph Glidden]]'s invention of barbed wire. Glidden's patent was earlier, thus Ellwood's connection with the actual invention is vague.<ref name=hild4>Hild, p. 8.</ref> He did, however, play a chief role in organizing the [[barbed wire]] industry into a viable and profitable business.<ref name=hild4/> The Ellwood House, including the four [[contributing properties]] on its 8.2 acre site, were added to the U.S. [[National Register of Historic Places]] on [[June 13]], [[1975]].<ref name=nris>[http://www.nr.nps.gov/ National Register Information System], National Register of Historic Places, ''National Park Service''.</ref><ref name=prop>"[http://gis.hpa.state.il.us/hargis Ellwood House]," Property Information Report, HAARGIS Database, ''Illinois Historic Preservation Agency''.
