'''Anna Chlumsky''' (born December 3, 1980; [[Chicago, Illinois]]) is an American [[Actor|actress]]. She is best-known for playing Vada Sultenfuss in the 1991 movie ''[[My Girl (film)|My Girl]]'' and the 1994 sequel ''[[My Girl 2]]''. Her cousin, [[Vik Foxx]], is the drummer for [[The Veronicas]]. Her father Frank Chlumsky is a culinary instructor for the culinary program at [[Kendall College]] in [[Chicago]]. Her surname is [[Czechs|Czech]] origin and meaning ''hill''. Pronounced ''kh-LOOM-skee''.

==Child acting career==
She entered show business at an early age, modeling with her mother in an advertising campaign. She is best known for playing Vada Sultenfuss in the 1991 movie ''[[My Girl (film)|My Girl]]'' and the 1994 sequel ''[[My Girl 2]]''.

She was in ''[[Gold Diggers: The Secret of Bear Mountain]]'' with [[Christina Ricci]], and screen tested for the part of 'Lex' in ''[[Jurassic Park]]'' which eventually went to [[Ariana Richards]].

[[Columbia Pictures]] expressed serious interest in ''My Girl 3'' (also known as ''[[Still My Girl]]'') and a script has been in development since 2003, according to series co-star [[Dan Aykroyd]]. Aykroyd revealed in media outlets that Columbia was attempting to sign Chlumsky for the role.<ref> [http://www.darkhorizons.com/news03/030306.php Dark Horizons; "Still My Girl"]</ref> The project is [[Development hell|still in development stages]], with no current updates in seven years.

==Hiatus from acting and return==
Chlumsky never intended for acting to be her life-long career. As a child she considered working with horses or in paleontology. Once she reached adulthood, roles became scarce and she began to move away from acting. She attended the [[University of Chicago]], majoring in International Studies, and graduated with a BA&nbsp;degree in 2002. During this time she ceased paying dues to the [[Screen Actors Guild]]. After graduation she worked as a fact-checker for the [[Zagat Survey]] and served as an editorial assistant for a [[HarperCollins]] science fiction-fantasy imprint. She came to find this work unsatisfying and decided she wanted to return to acting. She went to the Atlantic Acting School in [[Manhattan]] to receive more formal training (in her youth she deemed herself "a natural," so had not had as much formal training) and currently indicates that acting is the career she wants for life.<ref> {{cite news | url= http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/ct-live-0519-anna-chlumsky-20100519,0,6753664.story
