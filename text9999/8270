'''Gareth John Evans''', [[Officer of the Order of Australia|AO]], [[Queen's Counsel|QC]] (born 5 September 1944), is a former [[Australia]]n politician from 1978 to 1999 representing the [[Australian Labor Party]], serving in a number of ministries including [[Attorney-General of Australia|Attorney-General]] and [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Australia)|Foreign Minister]] from 1983 to 1996 in the [[Bob Hawke|Hawke]] and [[Paul Keating|Keating]] governments. He was president and chief executive officer of the [[International Crisis Group]] from 2000 to 2009. Soon after, he was appointed an honorary professorial fellow at the [[University of Melbourne]]. In 2010, Evans was appointed Chancellor of the [[Australian National University]].<ref name="chancellorbio">{{cite web|url=http://www.anu.edu.au/cabs/chancellor/index.html |title=Council and Governance - Chancellor |publisher=ANU |date= |accessdate=2010-05-30}}</ref>

==Early life==
Evans was born in [[Melbourne]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], the son of a tram driver. He was educated at [[Melbourne High School (Victoria)|Melbourne High School]]; the [[University of Melbourne]], where he graduated in arts and law; and [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]], where he took a Masters degree in [[Philosophy, Politics and Economics]].<ref name="crisis">[http://www.crisisgroup.org/home/index.cfm?id=2948&l=1 ]{{Dead link|date=May 2010}}</ref>  In 2004, he became an Honorary Fellow of [[Magdalen College, Oxford|Magdalen College]], his alma mater at Oxford. 

He practised as a [[barrister]] in Melbourne, specialising in representing [[trade union]]s.  From 1971 he was a lecturer and then a senior lecturer in constitutional law at Melbourne University, and was considered one of Australia's leading constitutional [[lawyer]]s.  In 1977 he edited ''Labor and the Constitution 1972-75'', a collection of essays on constitutional issues during the [[Gough Whitlam|Whitlam]] government.<ref>G. Evans (ed)''Labor and the Constitution 1972-75'' Heinemann, Melbourne (1977).</ref> He became a [[Queen's Counsel]] in 1983.<ref name="crisis"/>

Evans was active in the [[Australian Labor Party]] from his student days, and was an unsuccessful Labor candidate for the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] in 1975. A member of the right-wing [[Labor Unity]] faction, he was a supporter of [[Bob Hawke]]'s ambitions to lead the party after the fall of the Whitlam government. He was also a strong [[civil liberties|civil libertarian]], and was vice-president of the Victorian Council for Civil Liberties (now Liberty Victoria).<ref>{{cite web
|title=Home|publisher=Liberty Victoria|url=http://www.libertyvictoria.org.au/|accessdate=2007-01-25}}</ref>

==Parliamentary career==
====1977 - 1983====
In 1977 Evans was elected to the Senate and appointed to the Opposition front bench in 1980, becoming Shadow Attorney-General. He took an active part in the campaign to have [[Bill Hayden]] replaced as Labor leader.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} This happened shortly before the [[Australian federal election, 1983|1983 federal election]], which Hawke won. Evans then became [[Attorney-General of Australia|Attorney-General]].

====1983 - 1989====
As Attorney-General, Evans undertook a large agenda for law reform on a range of issues. He immediately ran into controversy, however, by arranging for the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] to take surveillance photos of the [[Franklin Dam]] project in [[Tasmania]], which the Hawke government was pledged to stop, over the objections of the Tasmanian [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]] government. The Hawke government was accused of misusing the RAAF for domestic political purposes. Evans's use of RAAF planes led to his earning the nickname "[[Biggles]]", after Captain [[W. E. Johns]]'s fictional aviation hero.<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/stateline/tas/content/2003/s890008.htm Stateline Tasmania, ABC] 27 June 2003</ref><ref>[http://www.aph.gov.au/SENATE/pubs/pops/pop04/pop4.pdf Papers on Parliament 1989] ''"In preparing the Commonwealth's case for the inevitable High Court challenge by Tasmania, Evans earned the popular title of 'Biggles' for arranging to have Royal Australian Air Force planes fly 'spy flights' over the dam site to collect court evidence."'' (p. 27)</ref>

In December 1984, Hawke moved Evans to the less-sensitive portfolio of [[Minister for Resources and Energy (Australia)|Resources and Energy]]. In 1987, he moved to [[Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government (Australia)|Transport and Communications]]. He was appointed [[Foreign Minister of Australia|Foreign Minister]] in September 1988. He held the position for seven years and six months, implementing significant changes to Australia's foreign policy. The Hawke and Keating governments were committed to shifting emphasis from Australia's traditional relationships with the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]] to increased involvement with Asian neighbours, particularly [[Indonesia]] and [[China]]. To this end, Evans travelled extensively within the region, developing relations with counterparts in most Asian countries.

Evans also helped with development of the [[United Nations]] plan for the rebuilding of [[Cambodia]] after the Vietnamese occupation; with negotiation of the [[International Chemical Weapons Convention]]; and with establishment of the [[Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation]] (APEC) forum and the [[ASEAN]] Regional Forum (ARF).{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} He also initiated the [[Canberra Commission on the Elimination of Nuclear Weapons]], although little ultimately came of this project.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} In 1995 he received the [[Grawemeyer Award]] for Ideas Improving World Order for his ''[[Foreign Policy]]'' article "Cooperative Security and Intrastate Conflict".{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

====1990 - 1998====
On 6 December 1990, Evans famously became the first Australian senator to say "fuck" in the Senate, when he interjected "for fuck's sake" during a speech by Senator [[Robert Hill]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id%3A%22chamber%2Fhansards%2F1990-12-06%2F0111%22 |title=ParlInfo - Title Details |publisher=Parlinfo.aph.gov.au |date=1990-12-06 |accessdate=2010-05-30}}</ref>

In 1991, during a political storm over [[Indonesian invasion of East Timor|Indonesian military violence in East Timor]], in his capacity as Australia's foreign minister, Evans defended the Indonesian military junta's actions by describing the [[Santa Cruz massacre|Dili massacre]] as 'an aberration, not an act of state policy'.<ref>[http://www.easttimorgovernment.com/history.htm/Towards independence]{{Dead link|date=May 2010}}</ref><ref>http://www.krysstal.com/display_acts.php?topic=Massacre</ref> This was despite growing evidence (both within Australian intelligence and the international media) of increasingly violent Indonesian military efforts to protect and extend their business interests in East Timor&mdash;interests that included coffee plantations, marble mines and large oil contracts&mdash;by utilizing starvation, napalm, torture and death camps.<ref>Matthew Jardine, East Timor's Unfinished Struggle: Inside the Timorese Resistance (1996), p.&nbsp;49<U+2013>50</ref><ref>George Aditjondro (1995), pp.&nbsp;59<U+2013>60. Quoted in Taylor (1991)</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/peace/etimor99/a3730.pdf |title=p.&nbsp;97. |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-05-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/business/longterm/asiaecon/stories/sons012598.htm |title=Asian Economies Report |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date=1998-01-25 |accessdate=2010-05-30}}</ref><ref>http://www.johnpilger.com/page.asp?partid=168 "[Aditjondro's research] ...gives credence to the reports of foreign observers that describe the use of napalm and Agent Orange, a carcinogen. In describing the bombardment (by mainly American-supplied planes), he chronicles the decimation of the gentios, or animist people of East Timor, who, before the invasion in 1975, lived in the valleys of the Ramelau mountain range in the western interior of the country. He puts their population in 1974 at 460,112. After four years of bombing, this had been reduced to 68,839....or by overcrowding prisoners in barracks on Atauro island with 40 to 80 inmates covered with black canvas." He describes how thousands of others were forced down to the lowlands of Baucau, into resettlement camps where many died. Dr. George Aditjondro cited by John Pilger 23 July 2000 UNSW</ref> Oil contracts that Evans himself had co-signed with the Indonesian military junta that enabled Australian companies to share with the Suharto family in what would later be established as clearly East Timor's oil. {{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} 

This connection was highlighted during an extensively publicised video recorded in a private jet over the Timor Sea. Senator Evans, replete with champagne<ref>Described as looking both exhilarated and inebriated in Soares pg.4-5</ref> offered an astonishingly naive toast, characterising the Timor Sea oil contract as "...uniquely unique".<ref>(See John Pilger's "Death of a Nation: The Timor Conspiracy 1994")</ref> Later, in a coincidental occurrence, when carriers of a secretly-filmed video exposing the Dili massacre arrived in Australia, they were inexplicably strip-searched by customs officials.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} Fortunately, they had passed the massacre footage on to another carrier on the same flight, who brought it through customs unhindered.<ref>Goodman, Amy and Allan Nairn. "Massacre: The Story of East Timor". 1992. Excerpted at Democracy Now, 28 January 2008</ref> Evans' diplomatic failures regarding East Timor were directly linked to his failures to procure senior positions in the United Nations including his ill-fated attempt to become the Secretary - General.<ref>John Pilger, '...so-called experts who wrote in empty, dehumanised jargon about the need for "regional stability" and supported what their friends in Jakarta called "Asian values", the code for tyranny. They supplied the verbiage for books that former ALP foreign affairs minister Gareth Evans thought would help him become the next secretary-general of the United Nations. [http://www.sangam.org/ANALYSIS_ARCHIVES/AutraliasRole.htm Under the heading Jakarta lobby] speech by John Pilger at the University of NSW, Sydney, Australia (July 17, 1999)</ref>

In 1993, as a member of the Keating government, Evans became Leader of the Government in the Senate. In this position, despite his heavy workload as Foreign Minister, he led the government's domestic legislative agenda in the upper house, where the government did not have a majority, and every bill had to be negotiated with the minor parties. He played a leading role in getting the government's [[native title]] bills through the Senate following the [[High Court of Australia]]'s decision in ''[[Mabo v Queensland]]''. 

Evans was the 1995 recipient of the [[Grawemeyer Award]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://grawemeyer.org/worldorder/previous-winners/1995-gareth-evans.html |title=1995 - Gareth Evans <U+2014> University of Louisville |publisher=Grawemeyer.org |date=1995-04-26 |accessdate=2010-05-30}}</ref> worth US$200,000 for improving world order, awarded by the University of Louisville in Louisville, Kentucky.

Evans had long desired to move from the Senate to the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], where he hoped to pursue his leadership ambitions. His first attempt to do so, in 1984, had been thwarted by the [[Socialist Left (Australia)|Socialist Left]] faction, but in 1996 he gained endorsement for the seat of [[Division of Holt|Holt]], in Melbourne's eastern suburbs, and was easily elected at the [[Australian federal election, 1996|1996 election]].

During the [[Paul Keating|Keating]] government, Gareth Evans was widely considered as a possible candidate for the [[High Court of Australia]]. Had he been appointed, he would have been the first politician appointed to the High Court since [[Lionel Murphy]]'s appointment in 1975.<ref>Adam Harvey, 'Evans not for High Court', ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'', 18 April 1994, p.5; Mike Seccombe, 'Bombed Out', ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'', 24 June 2005, p.9</ref> Although Evans sought appointment, his elevation to the Court was ultimately stymied.

====1996 - 1999====
The Keating government was defeated at the election, and Evans thus entered the House as an Opposition member. He was elected Deputy Leader of the Labor Party, defeating [[Simon Crean]], and he was appointed Shadow Treasurer by Leader [[Kim Beazley]]. 

During 1997 Evans orchestrated in secret the defection to the Labor Party of the leader of the [[Australian Democrats]], Senator [[Cheryl Kernot]], who resigned from the Senate in October and became a Labor House of Representatives candidate at the [[Australian federal election, 1998|1998 election]]. It later emerged that Evans had been having an affair with Kernot during the negotiations for her defection. (See details under Personal life, below.)

Labor's defeat at the [[Australian federal election, 1998|1998 election]] led to Evans's resignation from the opposition front bench, and in September 1999 he resigned from Parliament.

==Life after politics==
From January 2000 he was president and chief executive of the [[Brussels]]-based [[International Crisis Group]],.<ref>[http://www.crisisgroup.org/home/index.cfm?id=6221&l=1 International Crisis Group]{{Dead link|date=May 2010}}</ref> In 2000 and 2001, he co-chaired the [[International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty]] (ICISS), appointed by the government of [[Canada]]. Citing high workload and [[Burnout (psychology)|burnout]], he resigned in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,,25009932-601,00.html?from=public_rss |title=The Australian &#124; The Australian Homepage &#124; TheAustralian |publisher=Theaustralian.news.com.au |date= |accessdate=2010-05-30}}</ref>

In 2001, Evans was made an Officer of the [[Order of Australia]] (AO).<ref name="crisis"/> He was also a member of the UN Secretary-General's Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change, whose report ''A More Secure World: Our Shared Responsibility'', was published in December 2004.<ref name="crisis"/> He is a member of the Commission on Weapons of Mass Destruction sponsored by [[Sweden]] and chaired by [[Hans Blix]], and of the International Task Force on Global Public Goods, chaired by [[Ernesto Zedillo]].<ref name="crisis"/> He is an endorser of the [[Genocide Intervention Network]] and serves on the International Editorial Board of the [[Cambridge Review of International Affairs]].<ref name="crisis"/>
 
Evans is a member of the Board of Advisors of the [[Global Panel Foundation]].<ref>{{cite web|author=zevWorks |url=http://www.globalpanel.org/english/profile/Board%20Members/ |title=Global Panel Foundation |publisher=Globalpanel.org |date= |accessdate=2010-05-30}}</ref> In June 2008, the then [[Prime Minister of Australia|Australian Prime Minister]], [[Kevin Rudd]], appointed him co-chair of the [[International Commission on Nuclear Non-proliferation and Disarmament]].  In July 2008, he was selected as an inaugural fellow of the [[Australian Institute of International Affairs]]. In October 2008, he was awarded an honorary doctorate of law by the [[University of Sydney]].

Evans is also a member of [[Collegium International]], an organisation of leaders with political, scientific, and ethical expertise whose goal is to provide new approaches in overcoming the obstacles in the way of a peaceful, socially just and an economically sustainable world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collegium-international.org/en/founding_texts/appeal.html |title=founding texts |publisher=Collegium International |date= |accessdate=2010-05-30}}</ref>

In July 2009, Evans participated at the United Nations General Assembly in an interactive dialogue on Responsibility To Protect (R2P).<ref>[http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs//2009/ga10847.doc.htm General Assembly media release #10847] 23 July 2009</ref> On 11 August, he joined the University of Melbourne as an honorary professorial fellow in the School of Social and Political Sciences.

Evans was appointed the Chancellor of the [[Australian National University]] effective 1 January 2010,<ref name="chancellorbio"/> and was installed as Chancellor by [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]] [[Quentin Bryce]] at a ceremony on 18 February 2010,<ref>{{cite web|author=Professor Gareth Evans&nbsp; |url=http://news.anu.edu.au/?p=1961 |title=ANU News <U+00BB> ANU welcomes Chancellor Gareth Evans |publisher=News.anu.edu.au |date=2010-02-18 |accessdate=2010-05-30}}</ref> replacing [[Kim Beazley]] following his appointment as Ambassador to the United States.

Evans is a Member of the GLF Global Leadership Foundation.

==Personal life==
Evans is married to Professor Merran Evans, of [[Monash University]], with whom he has two adult children.<ref name="crisis"/>

Evans conducted a protracted extramarital affair with fellow senator [[Cheryl Kernot]] in the 1990s. Kernot was the leader of the [[Australian Democrats|Democrats]] when she spectacularly defected to join [[Australian Labor Party]] in 1997. While their affair was reportedly well-known within [[Canberra]] political circles, it was first made public in 2002 by [[Laurie Oakes]] in his ''[[The Bulletin]]'' column.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.australianpolitics.com/news/2002/07/02-07-03.shtml|last=Laurie|first=Oakes|title=Cheryl Kernot And The Unreported Story|publisher=[[The Bulletin]]|date= 3 July 2002|accessdate= 2007-04-01}}</ref>
