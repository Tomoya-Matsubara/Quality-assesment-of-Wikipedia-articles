'''Prohibition in the United States''' was a nationwide constitutional ban on the sale, production, importation, and transportation of [[alcoholic beverage]]s that remained in place from 1920 to 1933. It was promoted by the "dry" crusaders, a movement led by rural Protestants and social [[Progressives]] in the Democratic and Republican parties, and was coordinated by the [[Anti-Saloon League]], and the [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union]]. [[Prohibition]] was mandated under the [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution]]. Enabling legislation, known as the [[Volstead Act]], set down the rules for enforcing the ban and defined the types of alcoholic beverages that were prohibited. For example, religious uses of wine were allowed. Private ownership and consumption of alcohol was not made illegal under federal law; however, in many areas local laws were more strict, with some states banning possession outright. Nationwide Prohibition ended with the ratification of the [[Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-first Amendment]], which repealed the Eighteenth Amendment, on December 5, 1933.

Prohibition marked one of the last stages of the [[Progressive Era]]. During the 19th century, [[alcoholism]], drug abuse, [[gambling addiction]], and a variety of other social ills and abuses led to the activism to try to cure the perceived problems in society. Among other things this led many communities in the late 19th and early 20th century to introduce alcohol prohibition, with the subsequent enforcement in law becoming a hotly debated issue. Prohibition supporters, called drys, presented it as a victory for [[Public morality|public morals]] and health. Anti-prohibitionists, known as wets, criticized the alcohol ban as an intrusion of mainly rural Protestant ideals on a central aspect of urban, immigrant, and Catholic life. Though popular opinion believes that Prohibition failed, it succeeded in cutting overall alcohol consumption in half during the 1920s, and consumption remained below pre-Prohibition levels until the 1940s, suggesting that Prohibition did socialize a significant proportion of the population in temperate habits, at least temporarily.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jack S.

==History==
The [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] proposed the Eighteenth Amendment on December 18, 1917. Upon being approved by a 36th state on January 16, 1919, the amendment was ratified as a part of the Constitution. By the terms of the amendment, the country went dry one year later, on January 17, 1920.<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | coauthors = | title =History of Alcohol Prohibition | work = | publisher = National Commission on Marijuana and Drug Abuse | date = | url = http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/LIBRARY/studies/nc/nc2a.htm | accessdate =2013-11-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Dwight Vick|title=Drugs and Alcohol in the 21st Century: Theory, Behavior, and Policy |url=http://books.google.com/?id=fwRF5tFand8C&pg=PA128&dq=%22alcohol+prohibition+became+law+on+january+17%22#v=onepage&q=%22alcohol%20prohibition%20became%20law%20on%20january%2017%22&f=false|accessdate=2011-01-18|year=2010|publisher=Jones & Bartlett Learning|isbn=978-0-7637-7488-2|page=128}}</ref>

On November 18, 1918, prior to ratification of the Eighteenth Amendment, the U.S. Congress passed the temporary Wartime Prohibition Act, which banned the sale of alcoholic beverages having an alcohol content of greater than 2.75%.<ref>{{cite book | author =William D.

On October 28, 1919, [[United States Congress|Congress]] passed the [[Volstead Act]], the popular name for the National Prohibition Act, over President [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s [[veto]].

On March 22, 1933, President [[Franklin Roosevelt]] signed into law the [[Cullen<U+2013>Harrison Act]], legalizing beer with an alcohol content of 3.2% (by weight) and wine of a similarly low alcohol content. On December 5, 1933, ratification of the [[Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-first Amendment]] repealed the Eighteenth Amendment. However, United States federal law still prohibits the manufacture of [[Distilled beverage|distilled spirits]] without meeting numerous licensing requirements that make it impractical to produce spirits for personal beverage use.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ttb.gov/faqs/genalcohol.shtml#g1 |title=TTBGov General Alcohol FAQs |publisher=United States Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau |date=April 2006 |accessdate=2010-11-07}}</ref>

===Origins===
[[File:The Drunkard's Progress - Color.jpg|thumb|The Drunkard's Progress: A lithograph by [[Nathaniel Currier]] supporting the temperance movement, January 1846]]

Consumption of alcoholic beverages has been a contentious topic in America since the [[Colonial history of the United States|colonial period.]] In May 1657, the [[General Court of Massachusetts]] made the sale of strong liquor "whether known by the name of [[rum]]me, [[whisky|strong water]], [[wine]], [[brandy]], etc." illegal.<ref>{{cite book | author=Anthony Dias Blue | title=The Complete Book of Spirits: A Guide to Their History, Production, and Enjoyment | publisher=HarperCollins | year=2004 | isbn=0-06-054218-7 | page= 73}}</ref>

In general, informal social controls in the home and community helped maintain the expectation that the abuse of alcohol was unacceptable. "Drunkenness was condemned and punished, but only as an abuse of a God-given gift. Drink itself was not looked upon as culpable, any more than food deserved blame for the sin of [[gluttony]]. Excess was a personal indiscretion."<ref name="AaronMusto1981">{{cite book |author=Paul Aaron and David Musto |chapter=Temperance and Prohibition in America: An Historical Overview |editor1-last=Moore |editor1-first=Mark H. |editor2-last=Gerstein |editor2-first=Dean R. |title=Alcohol and Public Policy: Beyond the Shadow of Prohibition |location=Washington, DC |publisher=National Academy Press |year=1981 |pages=127<U+2013>181 |isbn=0-309-03149-4 }}</ref> When informal controls failed, there were legal options.

Shortly after the United States obtained independence, the [[Whiskey Rebellion]] took place in [[western Pennsylvania]] in protest of government-imposed taxes on [[whiskey]]. Although the taxes were primarily levied to help pay down the newly formed [[National debt of the United States|national debt]], it also received support from some social reformers, who hoped a "[[sin tax]]" would raise public awareness about the harmful effects of alcohol.<ref>Slaughter, 100.</ref> The whiskey tax was repealed after [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s [[Democratic-Republican Party]], which opposed the [[Federalist Party]] of [[Alexander Hamilton]] and [[George Washington]], came to power in 1800.<ref>Hogeland, 242.</ref>

[[Benjamin Rush]], one of the foremost physicians of the late eighteenth century, believed in moderation rather than prohibition. In his treatise, "The Inquiry into the Effects of Ardent Spirits upon the Human Body and Mind" (1784), Rush argued that the excessive use of alcohol was injurious to physical and psychological health, labeling drunkenness as a disease.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jack S. Blocker |title=American Temperance Movements: Cycles of Reform|year=1989|publisher=Twayne Publishers|location=Boston|page=10}}</ref> Apparently influenced by Rush's widely discussed belief, about 200 farmers in a [[Connecticut]] community formed a [[Temperance movement|temperance]] association in 1789. Similar associations were formed in [[Virginia]] in 1800 and [[New York]] in 1808.<ref name="Blocker 1989 16">Blocker, ''American Temperance Movements: Cycles of Reform'', p. 16.</ref> Within a decade, other [[Temperance movement|temperance]] groups had formed in eight states, some of them being statewide organizations. The words of Rush and other early temperance reformers served to dichotomize the use of alcohol for men and women. While men enjoyed drinking and often considered it vital to their health, women who began to embrace the ideology of "true motherhood" refrained from consumption of alcohol. Middle-class women, who were considered the moral authorities of their households, consequently rejected the drinking of alcohol, which they believed to be a threat to the home.<ref name="Blocker 1989 16"/> In 1830, on average, Americans consumed 1.7 bottles of [[hard liquor]] per week, three times the amount consumed in 2010.<ref name="t100524"/>

The 1898 Congressional Record, when reporting on a proposed tax on distilled spirits (H.R. 10253), noted that the relationship between populations, tax on distilled spirits (made from things other than fruit), and consumption was thus:  (The Aggregates are grouped by tax rate)

The [[American Temperance Society]] (ATS), formed in 1826, helped initiate the first temperance movement and served as a foundation for many later groups. By 1835 the ATS had reached 1.5 million members, with women constituting 35% to 60% of its chapters.<ref>Blocker, ''American Temperance Movements: Cycles of Reform'', p. 14.</ref>

The prohibition movement, also known as the dry crusade, continued in the 1840s, spearheaded by [[Pietism|pietistic]] religious denominations, especially the [[Methodist]]s. The late nineteenth century saw the [[temperance movement]] broaden its focus from abstinence to include all behavior and institutions related to alcohol consumption. Preachers such as [[Mark A. Matthews|Reverend Mark A. Matthews]] linked liquor-dispensing saloons with [[prostitution]].{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

Some successes were achieved in the 1850s, including the [[Maine law]], adopted in 1851, which banned the manufacture and sale of liquor. However, it was repealed in 1856. The temperance movement lost strength and was marginalized during the [[American Civil War]] (1861<U+2013>1865).

Following the war, the dry crusade was revived by the national [[Prohibition Party]], founded in 1869, and the [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union]] (WCTU), founded in 1873. The WCTU advocated the prohibition of alcohol as a method for preventing abuse from alcoholic husbands via education.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ruth Bordin| title=Women and Temperance: The Quest for Power and Liberty, 1873-1900|year=1981|publisher=Temple University Press|location=Philadelphia|page=8}}</ref> WCTU members believed that if their organization could reach children with its message, it could create a dry sentiment leading to prohibition. [[Frances Willard (suffragist)|Frances Willard]], the second president of the WCTU, held the aims of the organization were to create a "union of women from all denominations, for the purpose of educating the young, forming a better public sentiment, reforming the drinking classes, transforming by the power of Divine grace those who are enslaved by alcohol, and removing the [[Dram shop|dram-shop]] from our streets by law".<ref>{{cite book|author=Frances E.

In 1881 [[Kansas]] became the first state to outlaw alcoholic beverages in its [[Kansas Constitution|Constitution]]. [[Carrie Nation]] gained notoriety for enforcing the state's ban on alcohol consumption by walking into saloons, scolding customers, and using her hatchet to destroy bottles of liquor. Nation recruited ladies into the Carrie Nation Prohibition Group, which she also led. While Nation's vigilante techniques were rare, other activists enforced the dry cause by entering saloons, singing, praying, and urging saloonkeepers to stop selling alcohol.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kshs.org/exhibits/carry/carry1.htm |title=Carry A.

Court cases also debated the subject of prohibition. Although there was a tendency to support prohibition, some cases ruled in opposition. In ''[[Mugler v. Kansas]]'' (1887), Justice Harlan commented: "We cannot shut out of view the fact, within the knowledge of all, that the public health, the public morals, and the public safety, may be endangered by the general use of intoxicating drinks; nor the fact established by statistics accessible to every one, that the idleness, disorder, pauperism and crime existing in the country, are, in some degree...traceable to this evil."<ref name="Hopkins, Richard J 1925">{{cite journal | author=Richard J.

Proliferation of neighborhood saloons in the post-Civil War era became a phenomenon of an increasingly industrialized, urban workforce. Workingmen's bars were popular social gathering places from the workplace and home life. The brewing industry was actively involved in establishing saloons as a lucrative consumer base in their business chain. Saloons were more often than not linked to a specific brewery, where the saloonkeeper's operation was financed by a brewer and contractually obligated to sell the brewer's product to the exclusion of competing brands. A saloon's business model often included the concept of the [[free lunch]], where the bill of fare commonly consisting of heavily salted food meant to induce thirst and the purchase of drink.<ref>{{cite book | author =Marni Davis | title =Jews And Booze: Becoming American In The Age Of Prohibition | publisher =New York University Press | series = | volume = | edition = | year =2012 | location = | page =86&ndash;87 | url =  | isbn =978-0-8147-2028-8}}</ref> During the [[Progressive Era]] (1890<U+2013>1920), hostility toward saloons and their political influence became widespread, with the [[Anti-Saloon League]] superseding the Prohibition Party and the Woman's Christian Temperance Union as the most influential advocate of prohibition, after these latter two groups expanded their efforts to support other social reform issues, such as [[women's suffrage]], onto their prohibition platform.

Prohibition was an important force in state and local politics from the 1840s through the 1930s. Numerous historical studies demonstrated that the political forces involved were ethnoreligious.<ref>Paul Kleppner, ''The Third Electoral System 1853-1892: Parties, Voters, and Political Cultures.''

These religious groups identified saloons as politically corrupt and drinking as a personal sin. Other active organizations included the Women's Church Federation, the Women's Temperance Crusade, and the Department of Scientific Temperance Instruction. They were opposed by the wets, primarily liturgical [[Protestantism|Protestants]] ([[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalians]] and German Lutherans) and [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholics]], who denounced the idea that the government should define morality.<ref>Jensen (1971) ch 5.{{Full|date=November 2012}}</ref> Even in the wet stronghold of New York City there was an active prohibition movement, led by Norwegian church groups and [[African-American]] labor activists who believed that prohibition would benefit workers, especially African Americans.

Prohibition represented a conflict between urban and rural values emerging in the United States. Given the mass influx of migrants to the urban centers of the United States, many individuals within the prohibition movement associated the crime and morally corrupt behavior of American cities with their large, immigrant populations. Saloons frequented by immigrants in these cities were often frequented by politicians who wanted to "buy" the immigrants' votes in exchange for favors such as job offers, legal assistance, financial help, and trade union memberships. Thus, saloons were seen as a breeding ground for [[Corruption in the United States|political corruption]].<ref>http://www.degruyter.com/dg/viewarticle.fullcontentlink:pdfeventlink/$002fj$002fbehemoth.2013.6.issue-1$002fbehemoth-2013-0004$002fbehemoth-2013-0004.xml?format=INT&t:ac=j$002fbehemoth.2013.6.issue-1$002fbehemoth-2013-0004$002fbehemoth-2013-0004.xml</ref> In a backlash to the emerging reality of a changing American demographic, many prohibitionists subscribed to the doctrine of [[Nativism (politics)|nativism]], in which they endorsed the notion that America was made great as a result of its white Anglo-Saxon ancestry. This belief fostered resentments towards urban immigrant communities, who typically argued in favor of abolishing prohibition.<ref>Michael A. Lerner, ''Dry Manhattan: Prohibition in New York City'', p. 96&ndash;97.</ref> Additionally, nativist sentiments were part of a larger process of Americanization taking place during the same time period.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://science.jrank.org/pages/8266/Americanization-U-S-American-National-Identity-Ideologies-Americanization.html | title=US Americanization<U+2013>American National Identify and Ideologies of Americanization |publisher=Science.jrank.org |date= |accessdate=2013-05-26}}</ref>

Two other amendments to the Constitution were championed by dry crusaders to help their cause. One was granted in the [[Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixteenth Amendment]] (1913), which replaced alcohol taxes that funded the federal government with a federal income tax.<ref name="Last Call">{{cite book | author =Daniel Okrent | title =Last Call: The Rise and Fall of Prohibition | publisher =Scribner | series = | volume = | edition = | year =2010 | location =New York | page =57 | url =  | isbn =0-7432-7702-3}}{{oclc|419812305}}</ref> The other was women's suffrage, which was granted after the passage of the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Nineteenth Amendment]] in 1920; since women tended to support prohibition, temperance organizations tended to support women's suffrage.<ref name="Last Call"/>

In the [[United States presidential election, 1916|presidential election of 1916]], the Democratic incumbent, [[Woodrow Wilson]], and the Republican candidate, [[Charles Evans Hughes]], ignored the prohibition issue, as did both parties' political platforms. Democrats and Republicans had strong wet and dry factions, and the election was expected to be close, with neither candidate wanting to alienate any part of his political base.

In January 1917, the 65th Congress convened, in which the dries outnumbered the wets by 140 to 64 in the Democratic Party and 138 to 62 among Republicans. With America's declaration of war against Germany in April, [[German American]]s, a major force against prohibition, were sidelined and their protests subsequently ignored. In addition, a new justification for prohibition arose: prohibiting the production of alcoholic beverages would allow more resources<U+2014>especially grain that would otherwise be used to make alcohol<U+2014>to be devoted to the war effort. While wartime prohibition was a spark for the movement,<ref>''E.g.'', "The Economics of War Prohibition", pp. 143-144 in: Survey Associates, Inc., ''The Survey'', Volume 38, April<U+2013>September, 1917.</ref> World War I ended before nationwide Prohibition was enacted.

A resolution calling for a [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Constitutional amendment]] to accomplish nationwide Prohibition was introduced in Congress and passed by both houses in December 1917. By January 16, 1919, the Amendment had been ratified by 36 of the 48 states needed to assure it passage into law. Eventually, only two of those states<U+2014>[[Connecticut]] and [[Rhode Island]]<U+2014>opted out of ratifying it.<ref>{{cite journal | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =Connecticut Balks at Prohibition | journal =New York Times | volume = | issue = | pages = | publisher = | location = | date =February 5, 1919 | url =http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60917F73B5D147A93C7A91789D85F4D8185F9&| accessdate =March 31, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =Rhode Island Defeats Prohibition | journal =New York Times | volume = | issue = | pages = | publisher = | location = | date =March 13, 1918 | url =http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60915FC345C10738DDDAA0994DB405B888DF1D3& | accessdate =March 31, 2013 }}</ref> On October 28, 1919, Congress passed enabling legislation, known as the Volstead Act, to enforce the Eighteenth Amendment when it went into effect in 1920.

====Start of national prohibition (January 1920)====
[[File:1919 Budweiser ad for alcohol free beer.png|thumbnail|left|1919 Budweiser ad, announcing their reformulation of Budweiser as required under the Act, ready for sale by 1920.]]
Prohibition began on January 16, 1920, when the Eighteenth Amendment went into effect. A total of 1,520 Federal Prohibition agents (police) were tasked with enforcement.

Supporters of the Amendment soon became confident that it would not be repealed. One of its creators, Senator [[Morris Sheppard]], joked that "there is as much chance of repealing the Eighteenth Amendment as there is for a humming-bird to fly to the planet Mars with the [[Washington Monument]] tied to its tail."<ref>{{cite journal | author=David E.

At the same time, songs emerged decrying the act. After [[Edward VIII|Edward, Prince of Wales]], returned to the United Kingdom following his tour of Canada in 1919, he recounted to his father, King [[George V]], a ditty he had heard at a border town:

Prohibition became highly controversial among medical professionals, because alcohol was widely prescribed by the era's physicians for therapeutic purposes. Congress held hearings on the medicinal value of beer in 1921. Subsequently, physicians across the country lobbied for the repeal of Prohibition as it applied to medicinal liquors.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Jacob M.

While the manufacture, importation, sale, and transport of alcohol was illegal in the United States, Section 29 of the Volstead Act allowed wine and cider to be made from fruit at home, but not beer. Up to 200 gallons of wine and [[cider]] per year could be made, and some [[vineyard]]s grew grapes for home use. The Act did not prohibit consumption of alcohol. Many people stockpiled wines and liquors for their personal use in the latter part of 1919 before sales of alcoholic beverages became illegal in January 1920.

Prohibition in the United States did not apply in neighboring countries, where alcoholic drinks were not illegal. Distilleries and breweries in Canada, Mexico, and the Caribbean flourished as their products were either consumed by visiting Americans or smuggled into the United States illegally. The [[Detroit River]], which forms part of the U.S. border with Canada, was notoriously difficult to control, especially [[rum-running in Windsor]], Canada. When the U.S. government complained to the British that American law was being undermined by officials in [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]], [[Bahamas]], the head of the [[Colonial Office|British Colonial Office]] refused to intervene.<ref>{{cite video

As early as 1925, journalist [[H. L. Mencken]] believed that Prohibition was not working.<ref>{{cite book | author=Sylvia Engdahl | title =Amendments XVIII and XXI: Prohibition and Repeal | publisher =Greenhaven | series = | volume = | edition = | year =2009 | location = | pages = | url =  | isbn =}}</ref>  "Prohibition worked best when directed at its primary target: the working-class poor."<ref>{{cite journal | author=David Oshinsky | title =The Rise and Fall of Prohibition (book review) | journal =The New York Times | volume = | issue = | pages = | publisher = | location = | date =May 13, 2010 | url =| accessdate = }}</ref> Historian [[Lizabeth Cohen]] writes: "A rich family could have a cellar-full of liquor and get by, it seemed, but if a poor family had one bottle of home-brew, there would be trouble."<ref name="Cohen, Lizabeth">{{cite book|last=Cohen|first=Lizabeth|title=Making a New Deal: Industrial Workers in Chicago, 1919-1939|year=1991|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Chicago|isbn=0521428386|page=255|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=DWGfrXesoqUC&pg=PA255&lpg=PA255#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> Working-class people were inflamed by the fact that their employers could dip into a private cache while they, the employees, could not.<ref>Davis, ''Jews And Booze: Becoming American In The Age Of Prohibition'', p. 189.</ref>

Before the Eighteenth Amendment went into effect in January 1920, many of the upper classes stockpiled alcohol for legal home consumption after Prohibition began. They bought the inventories of liquor retailers and wholesalers, emptying out their warehouses, saloons, and club storerooms.  President [[Woodrow Wilson]] moved his own supply of alcoholic beverages to his Washington residence after his term of office ended. His successor, [[Warren G. Harding]], relocated his own large supply into the White House after inauguration.<ref>{{cite book|author=Garrett Peck|title=Prohibition in Washington, D.C.: How Dry We Weren't|year=2011|publisher=The History Press|location=Charleston, SC|isbn=978-1-60949-236-6|pages=42<U+2013>45}}</ref><ref>Davis, ''Jews And Booze: Becoming American In The Age Of Prohibition'', p. 145.</ref>

In October 1930, just two weeks before the congressional midterm elections, bootlegger [[George Cassiday]]<U+2014>"the man in the green hat"<U+2014>came forward and told how he had bootlegged for ten years for members of Congress. One of the few bootleggers ever to tell his story, Cassiday wrote five front-page articles for ''[[The Washington Post]]'', in which he estimated that 80% of congressmen and senators drank. The Democrats in the North were mostly wets, and in the [[United States presidential election, 1932|1932 election]], they made major gains. The wets argued that prohibition was not stopping crime, and was actually causing the creation of large-scale, well-funded and well-armed criminal syndicates.  As Prohibition became increasingly unpopular, especially in urban areas, its repeal was eagerly anticipated.<ref>Peck, ''Prohibition in Washington, D.C.: How Dry We Weren't'', p. 125&ndash;33.</ref>

===Weak enforcement===
One of the main reasons why Prohibition did not proceed smoothly was the inefficient means of enforcing it. From its inception, the Eighteenth Amendment lacked legitimacy in the eyes of the public who had previously been drinkers and law-abiding citizens. In some instances the public viewed Prohibition laws as "arbitrary and unnecessary", and therefore were willing to break them. Law enforcement found themselves overwhelmed by the rise in illegal, wide-scale alcohol distribution. The magnitude of their task was unexpected and law enforcement agencies lacked the necessary resources. Additionally, enforcement of the law under the Eighteenth Amendment lacked a centralized authority. Many attempts to impose Prohibition were deterred due to the lack of transparency between federal and state authorities. Clergymen were sometimes called upon to form vigilante groups to assist in the enforcement of Prohibition.<ref>-------. "Roper Asks Clergy to Aid in Work of Dry Enforcement," The Evening Public Ledger (Philadelphia, PA), Page 1, Image 1, col. 1, January 17, 1920</ref> Furthermore, American geography contributed to the difficulties in enforcing Prohibition. The varied terrain of valleys, mountains, lakes, and swamps, as well as the extensive seaways, ports, and borders the United States shared with Canada and Mexico made it exceedingly difficult for Prohibition agents to stop bootleggers given their lack of resources. Ultimately it was recognized with its repeal that the means by which the law was to be enforced was not pragmatic, and in many cases the legislature did not match the general public opinion.<ref>Report on the Enforcement of the Prohibition Laws of the United States. National Commission on Law Observance and Enforcement. Dated January 7th 1931 "Bad Features of the Present Situation and Difficulties in the Way of Enforcement</ref>

The second [[Ku Klux Klan]] talked a great deal about denouncing bootleggers and threatened private vigilante action against known offenders. Despite its large membership in the mid-1920s, it was poorly organized and seldom had an impact. Indeed the disgrace of the Klan after 1925 helped disparage any enforcement of Prohibition.<ref>Thomas R. Pegram,"Hoodwinked: The Anti-Saloon League and the Ku Klux Klan in 1920s Prohibition Enforcement." ''The Journal of the Gilded Age and Progressive Era'' (2008) 7#1 pp: 89-119.  [http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S1537781400001742 Online]</ref>

Prohibition was a major blow to the alcoholic beverage industry and its repeal was a step toward the amelioration of one sector of the economy. An example of this is the case of [[St. Louis]], one of the most important alcohol producers before prohibition started, who was ready to resume its position in the industry as soon as possible. Its major brewery had "50,000 barrels" of beer ready for distribution since March 22, 1933, and was the first alcohol producer to resupply the market; others soon followed. After repeal, stores obtained liquor licenses and restocked for business. After beer production resumed, thousands of workers found jobs in the industry again.<ref>{{cite journal | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =50,000 barrels ready in St Louis | journal =New York Times | volume = | issue = | pages = | publisher = | location = | date =March 23, 1933 | url =| accessdate = }}</ref>

Prohibition created a [[black market]] that competed with the formal economy, which came under pressure when the Great Depression struck in 1929. [[State governments of the United States|State governments]] urgently needed the tax revenue alcohol sales had generated. Franklin Roosevelt was elected in 1932 based in part on his promise to end prohibition, which influenced his support for ratifying the [[Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-first Amendment]] to repeal Prohibition.<ref>Dwight B Heath,  "Prohibition, Repeal, and Historical Cycles," Brown University Center for Alcohol and Addiction Studies</ref>

==Repeal==
Economic urgency played no small part in accelerating the advocacy for repeal. The number of conservatives who pushed for prohibition in the beginning decreased. Many farmers who fought for prohibition now fought for repeal because of the negative effects it had on the agriculture business.<ref name="Gitlin, Marty 2011">Gitlin, Marty. The Prohibition Era. Edina, MN: ABDO Publishing, 2011.</ref> Prior to the 1920 implementation of the Volstead Act, approximately 14% of federal, state, and local tax revenues were derived from alcohol commerce. When the Great Depression hit and tax revenues plunged, the governments needed this revenue stream.<ref>Davis, ''Jews And Booze: Becoming American In The Age Of Prohibition'', p. 191.</ref> Millions could be made by taxing beer. There was controversy on whether the repeal should be a state or nationwide decision.<ref name="Gitlin, Marty 2011"/> On March 22, 1933, President [[Franklin Roosevelt]] signed an amendment to the Volstead Act, known as the [[Cullen<U+2013>Harrison Act]], allowing the manufacture and sale of 3.2% beer (3.2% alcohol by weight, approximately 4% alcohol by volume) and light wines. The Volstead Act previously defined an intoxicating beverage as one with greater than 0.5% alcohol.<ref name="nih2006"/> Upon signing the Cullen<U+2013>Harrison Act, Roosevelt made his famous remark: "I think this would be a good time for a beer."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,954983-6,00.html | work=Time | title=F.D.R.'s Disputed Legacy | date=February 1, 1982 | accessdate=May 22, 2010 | first1=Otto | last1=Friedrich | first2=Hays | last2=Gorey}}</ref>

The Eighteenth Amendment was repealed on December 5, 1933, with ratification of the [[Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-first Amendment to the U.S. Constitution]]. Despite the efforts of [[Heber J. Grant]], president of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], a [[Utah]] convention helped ratify the Twenty-first Amendment.<ref>{{cite web | author=W.

The Twenty-first Amendment does not prevent states from restricting or banning alcohol; instead, it prohibits "transportation or importation" of alcohol in "any State, Territory, or Possession of the United States" "in violation of the laws thereof", thus allowing state and local control of alcohol.<ref>U.S. Constitution, Amendment XXI, Section 2.</ref> There are still numerous [[dry county|dry counties]] and townships in the United States that restrict or prohibit liquor sales.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jeff Burkhart |url=http://nationalgeographicassignmentblog.com/2010/08/19/the-great-experiment-prohibition-continues/ |title=The Great Experiment: Prohibition Continues|publisher=National Geographic Assignment |year=2010 |accessdate=2010-11-20}}</ref>

Additionally, many tribal governments prohibit alcohol on [[Indian reservation]]s. Federal law also prohibits alcohol on Indian reservations,<ref>18 USC, <U+00A7> 1154</ref> although this law is currently only enforced when there is a concomitant violation of local tribal liquor laws.<ref>{{cite web|title= Survey of American Indian Alcohol Statutes, 1975-2006: Evolving Needs and Future Opportunities for Tribal Health|url=http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-7634942/Survey-of-American-Indian-alcohol.html|date=March 1, 2008|author=Journal of Studies on Alcohol and Drugs}}</ref>

After its repeal, some former supporters openly admitted failure. For example, [[John D.

==Prohibition and pietistic Protestantism==

Liturgical ("high") churches (Catholic, Episcopal, and German Lutheran) opposed prohibition laws because they did not want the government redefining morality to a narrow standard and criminalizing the common liturgical practice of using wine.<ref>{{cite book|author=Richard J.

Revivalism in [[Second Great Awakening]] and the [[Third Great Awakening]] in the mid-to-late 19th century set the stage for the bond between pietistic Protestantism and prohibition in the United States: "The greater prevalence of revival religion within a population, the greater support for the Prohibition parties within that population."<ref>{{cite book | author=George M.

Making [[moonshine]] was an industry in the [[American South]] before and after Prohibition. In the 1950s [[muscle cars]] became popular and various roads became known as "Thunder Road" for their use by moonshiners. A popular [[ballad]] was created and the legendary drivers, cars, and routes were depicted on film in ''[[Thunder Road (film)|Thunder Road]]''.<ref>[http://www.oldcarmemories.com/content/view/63/76/ Thunder Road <U+2013> the First Muscle Car Movie] by Pete Dunton July 20, 2010 Old Car Memories</ref><ref>[http://jacksonville.com/news/premium/metro/2012-11-16/story/legend-moonshiners-thunder-road-lives-baker-county Legend of moonshiners' 'Thunder Road' lives on in Baker County] November 16, 2012 Jacksonville Metro</ref><ref>[http://www.metropulse.com/news/2010/jun/30/driving-tennessees-white-lightnin-trail-it-real-th/ Driving Tennessee's "White Lightnin' Trail"<U+2014>is it the Real Thunder Road?]; Jack Neely retraces the infamous bootlegger's route as it becomes an official state tourist attraction by Jack Neely MetroPulse June 30, 2010</ref><ref>[http://www.knoxnews.com/news/2007/feb/13/appalachian-journal-the-end-of-thunder-road/ Appalachian Journal: The end of Thunder Road]; Man known for whiskey cars, moonshine and rare auto parts is selling out by Fred Brown Knoxville News Sentinel February 13, 2007</ref>

===Rates of consumption during Prohibition===
[[File:Prohibition-era-prescription-for-whiskey.jpg|thumb|right|Prohibitio-era prescription for whiskey]]
Illegal sales are not officially reported or measured, but there are indirect estimates using alcohol related deaths and [[cirrhosis]], a liver disease specifically tied to ongoing alcohol consumption.<ref name="Miron">[Miron, Jeffrey, and Jeffrey Zwiebel "Alcohol Consumption During Prohibition" The American Economic Review, Vol. 81, No. 2, Papers and Proceedings of the Hundred and Third Annual Meeting of the American Economic Association (May, 1991), pp.242-247]</ref> Scholars estimate that consumption dropped to a low of about 60% of pre-prohibition levels around 1925, rising to almost 80% before the law was officially repealed.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

===Organized crime===
Organized crime received a major boost from Prohibition. [[American Mafia|Mafia]] groups limited their activities to prostitution, gambling, and theft until 1920, when organized [[Rum-running|bootlegging]] emerged in response to Prohibition.<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | coauthors = | title =Organized Crime - American Mafia | work = | publisher =Law Library - American Law and Legal Information  | date = | url =http://law.jrank.org/pages/11944/Organized-Crime-American-Mafia.html  | accessdate =2013-11-07}}</ref> A profitable, often violent, black market for alcohol flourished. Prohibition provided a financial basis for organized crime to flourish.<ref>Report on the Enforcement of the Prohibition Laws of the United States. National Commission on Law Observance and Enforcement. January 7, 1931</ref>

In a study of more than 30 major U.S. cities during the Prohibition years of 1920 and 1921, the number of crimes increased by 24%. Additionally, theft and burglaries increased by 9%, homicides by 12.7%, assaults and battery rose by 13%, drug addiction by 44.6%, and police department costs rose by 11.4%. This was largely the result of "black-market violence" and the diversion of law enforcement resources elsewhere. Despite the Prohibition movement's hope that outlawing alcohol would reduce crime, the reality was that the [[Volstead Act]] led to higher crime rates than were experienced prior to Prohibition and the establishment of a black market dominated by criminal organizations.<ref>{{cite book | author =Charles Hanson Towne | title =The Rise and Fall of Prohibition: The Human Side of What the Eighteenth Amendment Has Done to the United States | publisher =Macmillan | series = | volume = | edition = | year =1923 | location =New York | page =159&ndash;62 | url = | isbn =}}</ref> The [[Saint Valentine's Day Massacre]] produced seven deaths, considered one of the deadliest days of mob history.<ref>Keene, Jennifer D, Saul T Cornell, and Edward T O<U+2019>Donnell.

Furthermore, stronger liquor surged in popularity because its potency made it more profitable to smuggle. To prevent bootleggers from using industrial [[ethyl alcohol]] to produce illegal beverages, the federal government ordered the [[Denatured alcohol|poisoning of industrial alcohols]]. In response, bootleggers hired chemists who successfully renatured the alcohol to make it drinkable. As a response, the Treasury Department required manufacturers to add more deadly poisons, including the particularly deadly [[methyl alcohol]]. New York City medical examiners prominently opposed these policies because of the danger to human life. As many as 10,000 people died from drinking denatured alcohol before Prohibition ended.<ref name=Blum>{{cite web | author=Deborah Blum | title =The Chemist's War: The Little-told Story of how the U.S. Government Poisoned Alcohol During Prohibition with Deadly Consequences | work = | publisher =Slate  | date =2010-02-19 | url =http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/medical_examiner/2010/02/the_chemists_war.1.html | accessdate =2013-11-07}}</ref> New York City medical examiner [[Charles Norris (medical examiner)|Charles Norris]] believed the government took responsibility for murder when they knew the poison was not deterring people and they continued to poison industrial alcohol (which would be used in drinking alcohol) anyway. Norris remarked: "The government knows it is not stopping drinking by putting poison in alcohol... [Y]et it continues its poisoning processes, heedless of the fact that people determined to drink are daily absorbing that poison. Knowing this to be true, the United States government must be charged with the moral responsibility for the deaths that poisoned liquor causes, although it cannot be held legally responsible."<ref name=Blum/>

Another lethal substance that was often substituted for alcohol was "canned heat", also commonly known as [[Sterno]]. Forcing the substance through a makeshift filter, such as a handkerchief, created a rough liquor substitute; however, the result was poisonous, though not often lethal. Many of those who were poisoned as a result united to sue the government for reparations after the end of Prohibition.<ref name="Lusk, Rufus S 1932">{{cite journal | author =Rufus S. Lusk | title =The Drinking Habit  | journal =Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science | volume =163 | issue = | page =46&ndash;52 | publisher = | location = | date =September 1932 | language = | url =| accessdate = | doi=10.1177/000271623216300106}}</ref>

Making alcohol at home was very common during Prohibition. Stores sold grape concentrate with warning labels that listed the steps that should be avoided to prevent the juice from fermenting into wine. Some drugstores sold "medical wine" with around a 22% alcohol content. In order to justify the sale, the wine was given a medicinal taste.<ref name="Lusk, Rufus S 1932"/> Home-distilled hard liquor was called [[bathtub gin]] in northern cities, and [[moonshine]] in rural areas of [[Virginia]], [[Kentucky]], [[North Carolina]], [[South Carolina]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], and [[Tennessee]]. [[Homebrewing]] good hard liquor was easier than brewing good beer.<ref name="Lusk, Rufus S 1932"/> Since selling privately distilled alcohol was illegal and bypassed government taxation, law enforcement officers relentlessly pursued manufacturers.<ref name="Communications, Aug 1998">{{cite journal | authors =Scott Oldham | title =NASCAR Turns 50 | journal =Popular Mechanics | volume = | issue = | pages = | publisher =Hearst Communications | location = | date =August 1998 | language = | url =| accessdate = }}</ref> In response, bootleggers modified their cars and trucks by enhancing the engines and suspensions to make faster vehicles that, they presumed, would improve their chances of outrunning and escaping agents of the [[Bureau of Prohibition]], commonly called "revenue agents" or "revenuers". These cars became known as "moonshine runners" or {{"'}}shine runners".<ref>"NASCAR, an Overview - Part 1". Suite101.com. Google. Web. 22 Nov. 2009.</ref> Shops were also known to participate in the underground liquor market, by loading their stocks with ingredients for liquors, including [[b<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>dictine]], [[vermouth]], scotch mash, and even [[ethyl alcohol]], which anyone could purchase legally.<ref>{{cite journal | author =Joseph K.

Prohibition also had an effect on the [[Music of the United States|music industry in the United States]], specifically with [[jazz]]. [[Speakeasy|Speakeasies]] became very popular, and the [[Great Depression|Great Depression's]] migratory effects led to the dispersal of jazz music, from [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]] and went north through [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] and to New York. This led to the development of different styles in different cities. Its popularity in speakeasies and the emergence of advanced recording technology, jazz's popularity skyrocketed. It was also at the forefront of the minimal integration efforts going on at the time, as it united mostly black musicians with mostly white audiences.<ref>{{cite book | author =Lewis A. Erenberg | title =Swingin' the Dream: Big Band Jazz and the Rebirth of American Culture | publisher =The University of Chicago Press | series = | volume = | edition = | year =1998 | location =Chicago | page = | url = | isbn =}}</ref><!--page#?-->

Along with other economic effects, the enactment and enforcement of Prohibition caused an increase in resource costs. During the 1920s the annual budget of the [[Bureau of Prohibition]] went from $4.4 million to $13.4 million. Additionally, the [[United States Coast Guard|U.S. Coast Guard]] spent an average of $13 million annually on enforcement of prohibition laws.<ref>{{cite book|title=Bureau of Prohibition, Statistics Concerning Intoxicating Liquors|year=1930|publisher=Government Printing Office|location=Washington|page=2}}</ref> These numbers do not take into account the costs to local and state governments.

When Prohibition was repealed in 1933, organized crime lost nearly all of its [[black market]] profits from alcohol in most states, because of competition with legal liquor stores selling alcohol at lower prices. (States still retained the right to enforce their own state laws concerning alcohol consumption.) Some crime syndicates moved their efforts into expanding their protection rackets to cover legal liquor sales.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Behr|first1=Edward|title=Prohibition Thirteen Years that Changed America|date=1996|publisher=Arcade Publishing|location=New York|isbn=9781559703949|page=240}}</ref>

===Other effects===
[[File:Raceland Louisiana Beer Drinkers Russell Lee.jpg|thumb|Men and women drinking beer at a bar in [[Raceland, Louisiana]], September 1938. Pre-Prohibition saloons were mostly male establishments; post-Prohibition bars catered to both males and females.]]
As a result of Prohibition, the advancements of [[industrialization]] within the alcoholic beverage industry were essentially reversed. Large-scale alcohol producers were shut down, for the most part, and some individual citizens took it upon themselves to produce alcohol illegally, essentially reversing the efficiency of mass-producing and retailing alcoholic beverages. Closing the country's manufacturing plants and taverns also resulted in an economic downturn for the industry. While the [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighteenth Amendment]] did not have this effect on the industry due to its failure to define an "intoxicating" beverage, the [[Volstead Act]]'s definition of 0.5% or more alcohol by volume shut down the brewers, who expected to continue to produce beer of moderate strength.<ref name="Blocker, Jr. 2006 233<U+2013>243">{{cite journal|author=Jack S. Blocker, Jr.|title=Did Prohibition Really Work?|journal=American Journal of Public Health|date=February 2006|volume=96|issue=2|pages=233<U+2013>243|doi=10.2105/AJPH.2005.065409|pmid=16380559|pmc=1470475}}</ref>

As [[Western saloon|saloons]] died out, public drinking lost much of its macho connotation, resulting in increased social acceptance of women drinking in the semi-public environment of the [[Speakeasy|speakeasies]]. This new norm established women as a notable new target demographic for alcohol marketeers, who sought to expand their clientele.<ref name="Blocker, Jr. 2006 233<U+2013>243"/> Women thus found their way into the bootlegging business, with some discovering that they could make a living by selling alcohol with minimum likelihood of suspecion by law enforcement.<ref>O<U+2019>Donnell, Jack. <U+201C>The Ladies of Rum Row<U+201D>. American Legion Weekly, (May 1924): 3</ref> Before prohibition, women who drank publicly in saloons or taverns, especially outside of urban centers like Chicago or New York, were seen as immoral or likely to be a prostitute.<ref>Mar Murphy, "Bootlegging Mothers and Drinking Daughters: Gender and Prohibition in Butte Montana." American Quarterly, Vol 46, No 2, Pg 177, 1994</ref><!---added sentence really needs to be better integrated into paragraph. Wording needs tweaking-->

In 1930 the Prohibition Commissioner estimated that in 1919, the year before the Volstead Act became law, the average drinking American spent $17 per year on alcoholic beverages. By 1930, because enforcement diminished the supply, spending had increased to $35 per year (there was no inflation in this period). The result was an illegal alcohol beverage industry that made an average of $3 billion per year in illegal untaxed income.<ref>{{cite journal | author =E. E.

Doran | journal =Popular Science Monthly | volume =116 | issue =5 | page =147 | publisher = | location = | date =May 1930 | url =http://books.google.com/books?id=OigDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA19&dq=1930+plane+%22Popular&hl=en&ei=UoKOTpXcNMOUtwfE1sSLDA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CDwQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&q=1930%20plane%20%22Popular&f=true| accessdate =2013-11-07}}</ref>

Heavy drinkers and alcoholics were among the most affected groups during Prohibition. Those who were determined to find liquor could still do so, but those who saw their drinking habits as destructive typically had difficulty in finding the help they sought. Self-help societies had withered away along with the alcohol industry. In 1935 a new self-help group called [[Alcoholics Anonymous|Alcoholics Anonymous (AA)]] was founded.<ref name="Blocker, Jr. 2006 233<U+2013>243"/>

Prohibition had a notable effect on the alcohol brewing industry in the United States. Wine historians note that Prohibition destroyed what was a fledgling wine industry in the United States. Productive, wine-quality grapevines were replaced by lower-quality vines that grew thicker-skinned grapes, which could be more easily transported. Much of the institutional knowledge was also lost as winemakers either emigrated to other wine producing countries or left the business altogether.<ref>{{cite book | author =[[Karen MacNeil]] | title =The Wine Bible | publisher = | series = | volume = | edition = | year = | location = | page =630&ndash;31 | url =  | isbn =}}</ref> Distilled spirits became more popular during Prohibition.<ref name="Lusk, Rufus S 1932"/> Because of its higher alcohol content in comparison to fermented wine and beer, it became common to mix and dilute the hard alcohol.<ref name="Lusk, Rufus S 1932"/>

====Winemaking during Prohibition====
The Volstead Act specifically allowed individual farmers to make certain wines "on the [[legal fiction]] that it was a non-intoxicating fruit-juice for home consumption",<ref>{{cite web | author= | url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,742105,00.html |title=PROHIBITION: Wine Bricks |publisher=TIME |date=1931-08-17 |accessdate=2013-05-26}}</ref> and many did so. Enterprising grape farmers produced liquid and semi-solid grape concentrates, often called "wine bricks" or "wine blocks".<ref>{{cite news | title=Prohibition in Wine Country| publisher=''[[Napa Valley Register]]'' |url=http://www.napavalleyregister.com/lifestyles/real-napa/article_ed8bdf22-4a81-11df-bb7d-001cc4c002e0.html | date=2010-04-18 | author=Kelsey Burnham}}</ref> This demand led [[California (wine)|California]] grape growers to increase their land under cultivation by about 700% during the first five years of Prohibition. The grape concentrate was sold with a warning: "After dissolving the brick in a gallon of water, do not place the liquid in a jug away in the cupboard for twenty days, because then it would turn into wine".<ref name="AaronMusto1981" />

The Volstead Act allowed the sale of [[sacramental wine]] to priests and ministers, and allowed [[rabbis]] to approve sales of sacramental wine to individuals for [[Sabbath]] and holiday use at home. Among [[Jews]], four rabbinical groups were approved, which led to some competition for membership, since the supervision of sacramental licenses could be used to secure donations to support a religious institution. There were known abuses in this system, with imposters or unauthorized agents using loopholes to purchase wine.<ref name="Last Call"/><ref name=Sprecher>{{cite web|author=Hannah Sprecher |title="Let Them Drink and Forget Our  Poverty": Orthodox Rabbis React to  Prohibition|url=http://americanjewisharchives.org/publications/journal/PDF/1991_43_02_00_sprecher.pdf|publisher=American Jewish Archives|accessdate=4 September 2013}}</ref>
