'''McDonnell Douglas''' was a major American [[aerospace manufacturer]] and [[defense contractor]], producing a number of famous commercial and military aircraft. It formed from a merger of [[McDonnell Aircraft]] and [[Douglas Aircraft Company|Douglas Aircraft]] in 1967.  McDonnell Douglas was based at [[Lambert-St. Louis International Airport]] near [[St. Louis, Missouri]].

The McDonnell Douglas Technical Services Company (MDTSC), a subsidiary of McDonnell Douglas, was headquartered in unincorporated [[St. Louis County, Missouri|St. Louis County]], Missouri, United States.<ref>"[http://web.archive.org/web/19970124130147/www.mdtsc.com/ Welcome!]."

==History==
===Background===
[[File:EF-10B VMCJ-2 Vietnam NAN11-66.jpg|thumb|right|Douglas F3D Skyknight]]

The company was formed from the firms of [[James Smith McDonnell]] and [[Donald Wills Douglas, Sr.|Donald Wills Douglas]] in 1967. Both men were of Scottish ancestry, graduates of [[MIT]] and had worked for the aircraft manufacturer [[Glenn L. Martin Company]].<ref name="Yenne_p6">Yenne 1985, pp. 6<U+2013>9.</ref>

Douglas had been chief engineer at Martin before leaving to establish Davis-Douglas Company in early 1920 in Los Angeles. He bought out his backer and renamed the firm the [[Douglas Aircraft Company]] in 1921.<ref name="Yenne_p10">Yenne 1985, pp. 10<U+2013>12.</ref>

McDonnell founded J.S. McDonnell & Associates in [[Milwaukee|Milwaukee, Wisconsin]] in 1926. His idea was to produce a personal aircraft for family use. The economic depression from 1929 ruined his ideas and the company collapsed. He worked at three companies with the final being Glenn Martin Company in 1933. He left Martin in 1938 to try again with his own firm, [[McDonnell Aircraft Corporation]], this time based at [[Lambert-St. Louis International Airport|Lambert Field]], outside [[St. Louis, Missouri]].<ref>Leiser, Ken.

''St. Louis Post-Dispatch'', 28 August 2009.</ref>

World War II was a major earner for Douglas. The company produced almost 30,000 aircraft from 1942 to 1945 and the workforce swelled to 160,000. Both companies suffered at the end of hostilities, facing an end of government orders and a surplus of aircraft.

The two companies were now major employers, but both were having problems. Douglas was strained by the cost of the DC-8 and [[McDonnell Douglas DC-9|DC-9]], while McDonnell suffered lean times during any downturns in procurement.  The two companies began to sound each other out about a merger. Inquiries began in 1963; Douglas offered bid invitations from December 1966 and accepted that of McDonnell.<ref>{{cite news |url = http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F00E1EF63A58117B93C4AB178AD85F438685F9 |title = McDonnell and Douglas take a giant step |work=New York Times |first = Robert |last = Wright |date = 26 January 1967}}</ref> The two firms were officially merged on 28 April 1967 as the McDonnell Douglas Corporation (MDC).<ref>{{cite web |url = http://news.google.co.uk/newspapers?id=-9QfAAAAIBAJ&sjid=L9kEAAAAIBAJ&pg=4254,5627094&dq=mcdonnell+douglas&hl=en |title = McDonnell Douglas merger cleared |publisher=Fort Scott Tribune |date = 27 April 1967}}</ref>  The two companies were a good fit for each other.

In 1967, with the merger of McDonnell and Douglas Aircraft, [[David S. Lewis|David Lewis]], then president of [[McDonnell Aircraft|McDonnell]], was named chairman of what was called the Long Beach, [[Douglas Aircraft]] Division. At the time of the merger, Douglas Aircraft was estimated to be less than a year from bankruptcy. Flush with orders, the DC-8 and DC-9 aircraft were 9 to 18 months behind schedule, incurring stiff penalties from the airlines. Lewis was active in [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10|DC-10]] sales in an intense competition with [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed's]] [[Lockheed L-1011|L-1011]], a rival tri-jet aircraft.<ref>{{cite news |url = http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/680204092.html?dids=680204092:680204092&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&type=historic&date=Jun+06%2C+1972&author=&pub=Los+Angeles+Times&desc=DC-10+DEAL+ALSO+PLEASES+LOCKHEED&pqatl=google |title = DC-10 deal also pleases Lockheed |work=Los Angeles Times |first = Charles |last = Wood |date = 6 June 1972}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url = http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60A13FE3B5C1A7A93C3A81788D85F408785F9 |title = Lockheed seeking greater range for Tristar; hopes to make its jet more competitive|work=New York Times |first = Robert |last = Wright |date = 11 March 1974}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url = http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/699033162.html?dids=699033162:699033162&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&type=historic&date=Jun+12%2C+1971&author=&pub=Los+Angeles+Times&desc=L-1011+Customers+Admit+Concessions+by+Douglas&pqatl=google |title = L-1011 Customers admit concessions by Douglas |work=Los Angeles Times |first = Robert |last = Wood |date = 12 June 1971}}</ref> In two years, Lewis had the operation back on track and in positive cash flow.

On 13 January 1988, McDonnell Douglas and [[General Dynamics]] won the US Navy Advanced Tactical Aircraft (ATA) contract. The US$4.83&nbsp;billion contract was to develop the [[A-12 Avenger II]], a stealthy, carrier-based, long-range flying wing attack aircraft that would replace the [[A-6 Intruder]].

In January 1989 Robert Hood was appointed to lead McDonnell Douglas, replacing retiring Worsham.  McDonnell Douglas then introduced a major reorganization called the [[Total Quality Management]] System (TQMS). TQMS ended the functional setup where engineers with specific expertise in aerodynamics, structural mechanics, materials, and other technical areas worked on several different aircraft. This was replaced by a product-oriented system where they focus on one specific airplane. As part of reorganization, 5,000 managerial and supervisory positions were eliminated at Douglas. The former managers could apply for 2,800 newly created posts; the remaining 2,200 would lose their managerial responsibilities.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1989/08/28/72404/ | title=BUMPY FLIGHT AT MCDONNELL DOUGLAS Even before two DC-10 crashes, it was beset by defense cutbacks and factory foul-ups. Now managers must unsnarl a new reorganization to get airborne again. | first = Ronald | last=Henkoff | publisher=Fortune}}</ref>  The reorganization reportedly led to widespread loss of morale at the company and TQMS was nicknamed "Time to  Quit and Move to Seattle" by employees referring to the competitor Boeing headquartered in Seattle, WA.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.nytimes.com/1991/09/29/business/breathing-easier-at-mcdonnell-douglas.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm | title = Breathing Easier at McDonnel Douglas | publisher = New York Times | first = Richard | last = Stevenson | date =  29 September 1991}}</ref>

===1990<U+2013>1997===
Technical issues, development cost overruns, growing unit costs, and delays led to the termination of the A-12 Avenger II program on 13 January 1991 by Defense Secretary [[Dick Cheney]].  Years of litigation would proceed over the contract's termination: the government claimed that the contractors had defaulted on the contract and were not entitled to the final progress payments, while McDonnell Douglas and General Dynamics believed that the contract was terminated out of convenience and thus the money was owed.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/aircraft/a-12.htm | title=A-12 Avenger II|publisher=GlobalSecurity.org|accessdate=16 March 2007}}</ref>  The case was contested through litigation until a settlement was reached in January 2014.  The chaos and financial stress created by the collapse of the A-12 program led to the layoff of 5,600 employees.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE3DB1E38F93BA35750C0A967958260 |title=McDonnell Air gets president |work=New York Times  |date=3 August 1991 |accessdate=16 March 2007}}</ref>  The advanced tactical aircraft role vacated by the A-12 debacle would be filled by another McDonnell Douglas program, the [[F/A-18E/F Super Hornet]].<ref name= 'F19a'/><ref>{{cite news |url = http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/683629842.html?dids=683629842:683629842&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&type=historic&date=Oct+30%2C+1979&author=&pub=Los+Angeles+Times&desc=McDonnell+Trying+to+Hog+F-18+Sales%2C+Northrop+Suit+Says&pqatl=google |title = McDonnell trying to hog F-18 sales, Northrop suit says |first = Ken |last = Gepfert |work=Los Angeles Times |date = 30 October 1979}}</ref>

However the purchasing of aircraft was curtailed as the [[Cold War]] came to an abrupt end in the 1990s. This curtailment in military procurements combined with the loss of the contracts for two major projects, the [[Advanced Tactical Fighter]] and [[Joint Strike Fighter Program|Joint Strike Fighter]], severely hurt McDonnell Douglas.<ref name = 'lastplane1'>{{cite news |url = http://articles.latimes.com/2001/feb/22/business/fi-28719|title = Last Plane Out for Aerospace Pioneer; Aviation: Ceremony today marks the delivery of the last commercial aircraft built under the McDonnell Douglas name |work=Los Angeles Times |first = Peter |last = Pae |date = 22 February 2001}}</ref><ref name = 'mergeJSF1'>{{cite news |url = http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/baltsun/access/11225158.html?dids=11225158:11225158&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Feb+04%2C+1997&author=Schneider%2C+Greg&pub=The+Sun&desc=Merger+or+no%2C+Boeing+and+McDonnell+Douglas+linked&pqatl=google |title = Merger or no, Boeing and McDonnell Douglas linked |publisher=Baltimore Sun |first = Greg |last = Schneider |date = 4 February 1997}}</ref>

In 1991, MD-11 was not quite a success, ongoing tests of the MD-11 revealed a significant shortfall in the aircraft's performance. An important prospective carrier, [[Singapore Airlines]] (SIA), required a fully laden aircraft that could fly from Singapore to Paris, against strong headwinds during mid-winter; the MD-11 did not have sufficient range for this at the time.<ref name="Airbus 1999 p66">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|p=66}}</ref>  Due to the less-than-expected performance figures, SIA cancelled its 20-aircraft MD-11 order on 2 August 1991, and ordered 20 A340-300s instead.<ref>{{harvnb|Norris||Wagner|2001|p=59}}</ref>

[[File:Md-12-2.png|thumb|left|[[McDonnell Douglas MD-12]] aircraft concept]]

In 1992, McDonnell Douglas unveiled a study of a double deck jumbo-sized aircraft designated [[McDonnell Douglas MD-12|MD-12]].<ref name = 'flyint1'/><ref name="MDC_brochure">{{cite web |url = http://md-eleven.net/MD11-MD12-undeveloped-models |title = MDC brochures for undeveloped versions of the MD-11 and MD-12 |publisher=md-eleven.net |accessdate =14 April 2008}}</ref> Despite briefly leaving the market, the study was perceived as merely a public relations exercise to disguise the fact that MDC was struggling under intense pressure from [[Boeing]] and [[Airbus]]. It was clear to most in the industry that MDC had neither the resources nor the money to develop such a large aircraft,<ref>{{cite news |title = McDonnell Douglas in shake-up as profits drop |url = http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/mcdonnell-douglas-in-shakeup-as-profits-drop-1539656.html |work=The Independent |location=London |date = 11 August 1992 |first = Larry |last = Black }}</ref> and the study quickly sank without a trace.

Following Boeing's 1996 acquisition of [[Rockwell International|Rockwell]]'s [[North American Aviation|North American]] division, McDonnell Douglas merged with [[Boeing]] in August 1997 in a US $13 billion [[stock swap]], with Boeing as the surviving company.<ref name=merger/><ref name = 'mergeJSF1'/>  Boeing adopted the McDonnell Douglas [[:File:Boeing-Logo.svg|logo]], which shows the globe being encircled in tribute to the [[first aerial circumnavigation]] which was accomplished in 1924 using [[Douglas Aircraft Company|Douglas]] aircraft.
