'''Darwin's Fox''' or '''Darwin's Zorro''' (''Lycalopex fulvipes'') is a small [[Critically endangered species|Critically endangered]] [[Canidae|canine]] from the genus ''[[Lycalopex]]''. It is also known as the '''Zorro Chilote''' or '''Zorro de Darwin'''<ref name=iucn/> in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and lives on [[Chilo<U+00E9> Island]] and [[Nahuelbuta National Park]] in mainland [[Chile]] ([[Araucan<U+00ED>a Region]]). 

Darwin's Fox was first collected from San Pedro Island off the coast of Chile by the naturalist [[Charles Darwin]] in 1834. It was long held that Darwin's Fox was a subspecies of the [[South American Gray Fox]] (''L. griseus''); however, the discovery of a small population of Darwin's Fox on the mainland in Nahuelbuta National Park in 1990<ref name=Medel1990>Medel, R.G. et al. 1990. Discovery of a continental population of the rare Darwin Fox, ''Dusicyon fulvipes'' (Martin, 1839) in Chile. ''Biological Conservation'' 51:71-77</ref> and subsequent genetic analysis has clarified the fox's status as a unique species.<ref name=Yahnke1996>Yahnke, C.J. et al. 1996.

==Taxonomy and evolution==
[[File:Azaraskull.jpg|thumb|left|Darwin's fox skull]]
''Pseudalopex'' is a [[South America]]n genus of canine distantly related to wolves and is technically not a [[fox]]. When Charles Darwin collected a specimen from San Pedro Island in [[Chilo<U+00E9> Archipelago]] during the voyage of the [[HMS Beagle|Beagle]], he observed that it was distinct from the species ([[Culpeo|''L. culpaeus'']] and [[South American Gray Fox|''L. griseus'']]) that occur on the mainland.<ref name=Darwin1839>Darwin, C. 1839. Journal of researches into the geology and natural history of the various countries visited by H.M.S. Beagle, under the command of Captain Fitzroy, R.N. from 1832<U+2013>1836. London: Henry Colburn.</ref> Later, Darwin's Fox was classified as a subspecies (''Pseudalopex griseus fulvipes'') of the latter. Darwin's Fox does not [[Hybrid (biology)|interbreed]] with the other ''Lycalopex'' species, only lives in forests, and is smaller and darker-colored than the other species. In 1990 a small population of Darwin's Fox was found on the mainland in the forested Nahuelbuta National Park, indicating that the fox was not endemic to the island. According to Yahnke et al., in their 1996 article published in the Journal of the Society for Conservation Biology, analysis of mitochondrial DNA of Darwin's Fox and the Gray Fox showed two patterns, indicating Darwin's Fox was a new species, closely related to the [[Sechuran Fox]]. Also according to Yahnke (1995; et al.1996) the present restricted range is a relict of a much wider former range. Zoologists noted the distinctiveness in the ecological niche, appearance, and behavior of this species. Darwin's Fox is differentiated from the [[Lycalopex griseus|Gray Fox]] in being darker; having shorter legs; a broader, shorter skull; smaller auditory bullae; a more robust dentition; and a different jaw shape and style of premolar occlusion.

In the late [[Pleistocene]], Chilo<U+00E9> Island was connected to mainland Chile by a land bridge. The land bridge was severed about 15,000 years ago when the sea level rose following the last glaciation.<ref name=Villagran1988>Villagr<U+00E1>n, C. 1988. Late Quaternary vegetation of Southern Isla Grande de Chilo<U+00EB>, Chile. ''Quaternary Research'' 29: 294<U+2013>306</ref> This created two isolated populations of Darwin's Fox.

It is brown and red on the face.

==Diet==
Darwin's Fox has a vast diet. In dense forests, where it exists, the foxes hunt for mammals, [[reptile]]s, [[beetle]]s, and [[invertebrate]]s. Sometimes it selects [[fruit]]s and [[berries]]. [[Bird]]s and [[amphibian]]s to a lesser degree are also consumed.

==Ecology==
Darwin's fox is generally believed to be a forest obligate species found only in southern temperate [[rainforest]]s.<ref name=iucn/> They only occur in forested areas on Chilo<U+00E9> and on the mainland. They are most active at twilight and before sunrise. Darwin's fox  generally only occur in the southern primary temperate subtropical forests<!--- their range - variously from other false foxes (especially Pseudalopex), prefers open spaces (If someone can make sense of this, feel free to add it)-->. The population of Chilo<U+00E9> has about 200 individuals, and Nahuelbuta on the mainland contains about 50 individuals. The total population size is about 250 mature individuals with at least 90% of the population occurring in one subspopulation (Chilo<U+00E9> Island). Although the species is protected in Nahuelbuta National Park, substantial mortality sources exist when foxes move to lower, unprotected private areas in search of milder conditions during the winter.<ref> Jim<U+00E9>nez, J.E., Lucherini, M. & Novaro, A.J., 2004; IUCN & CSG  2004). On mainland Chile, Jaime Jim<U+00E9>nez has observed a small population since 1975 in Nahuelbuta National Park; this population was first reported to science in the early 1990s (Medel et al. 1990; Jim<U+00E9>nez, J.E., Lucherini, M. & Novaro, A.J.,  2004; IUCN, 2004</ref>

==Conservation status==
It is believed that there are only 250 Darwin's foxes on Chilo<U+00E9> Island and up to 70 on the mainland, and they are listed as critically endangered by the [[World Conservation Union]].<ref name=iucn/> Fragmentation of forest adjacent to the national park and on the island is a concern for their conservation, and feral dogs may pose the greatest threat to their survival by spreading disease or directly attacking. Persecution by people who think that the foxes attack domestic fowls is also a potential problem.
