'''No. 33 Squadron''' is a [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) transport and [[aerial refueling|air-to-air refuelling]] squadron controlled by [[No. 86 Wing RAAF|No.&nbsp;86 Wing]], under [[Air Lift Group RAAF|Air Lift Group]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airforce.gov.au/About_us/Structure_of_the_RAAF/Air_Command/Air_Lift_Group/No._86_Wing?RAAF-L/vGzk7TMG7p5QeGWqFzal55alCa8iJ6 | title=No. 86 Wing|publisher=[[Royal Australian Air Force]]|accessdate=16 June 2013}}</ref>. It operates five [[Airbus A330 MRTT|Airbus KC-30A Multi Role Tanker Transports]] from [[RAAF Base Amberley]], Queensland. The squadron was formed in 1942 for service during World War&nbsp;II, operating [[Short Empire]] flying boats and other smaller types. By 1944 it had re-equipped with [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain|Douglas C-47 Dakotas]], which it operated until disbanding in 1946. The unit was re-established in February 1981 as a [[flight (military unit)|flight]], flying two [[Boeing&nbsp;707]]s for [[Royal Australian Air Force VIP aircraft|VIP]] and other long-range transport duties out of [[RAAF Base Richmond]], New South Wales. No.&nbsp;33 Flight was re-formed as a full squadron in July 1983. By 1988 it was operating six 707s, four of which were subsequently converted for aerial refuelling. It lost one of its transport jets in a crash in October 1991. Having been without aircraft since the retirement of the 707s in June 2008, No.&nbsp;33 Squadron began re-equipping with KC-30As in June 2011.

===World War II===

During February and March 1942, the RAAF formed four transport units: Nos.&nbsp;33, [[No. 34 Squadron RAAF|34]], [[No. 35 Squadron RAAF|35]] and 36&nbsp;Squadrons. No.&nbsp;33 Squadron was established on 16&nbsp;February at [[RAAF Base Townsville|Townsville]], Queensland, under the control of North Eastern Area Command.<ref>Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/07.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 481]</ref><ref name="Units35">RAAF Historical Section, ''Maritime and Transport Units'', pp. 35<U+2013>58</ref> It was equipped with four [[Short Empire]] flying boats transferred from [[No. 11 Squadron RAAF|No. 11 Squadron]], along with a number of smaller types including [[de Havilland Dragon]]s and [[de Havilland Tiger Moth|Tiger Moth]]s, [[Avro Anson]]s and [[Stinson L-1 Vigilant|Vultee Vigilant]]s.<ref name="Units35"/><ref name=Eather>Eather, ''Flying Squadrons'', pp. 68<U+2013>69</ref>  Less than two weeks later the squadron suffered its first loss when one of the Empires was destroyed in a landing accident at Townsville; the six crew members were killed. A second Empire was destroyed at its mooring during a [[Attack on Broome|Japanese air attack on Broome]], Western Australia, on 3 March; another Empire was impressed from [[Qantas]] to replace the lost aircraft. One of the squadron's tasks was search-and-rescue; it lost another Empire on 8 August 1942 after it sank in heavy seas off the coast of New Guinea while trying to rescue survivors of a [[torpedo]]ed ship.<ref name="Units35"/>

No.&nbsp;33 Squadron transferred to [[Port Moresby]] in January 1943, providing air transport to Australian forces involved in the [[New Guinea campaign]]. Transport needs were so desperate in New Guinea that even the Tiger Moths were employed, delivering a total of {{convert|77|kg|lbs}} per trip.<ref name=Eather/> In September<U+2013>October 1943, the squadron began taking delivery of fifteen [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain|Douglas C-47 Dakotas]] to replace its assortment of aircraft.<ref name="Units35"/><ref name=Eather/> By the time it transferred to [[Milne Bay]] on 1&nbsp;January 1944, it was operating Dakotas exclusively, and continued to do so for the rest of the war. The squadron relocated to [[Lae]] on 15&nbsp;January 1945.<ref name="Units35"/> Following the end of hostilities in August 1945, it was tasked with repatriating service personnel and former [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]].<ref name=Eather/> No.&nbsp;33 Squadron returned to Townsville on 11 March 1946, and disbanded there on 13 May.<ref name="Units35"/>

===Re-establishment===
In 1978, the Australian government decided to purchase two passenger jets for strategic transport, primarily to mitigate what it saw as the risk of terrorist attack inherent in [[Royal Australian Air Force VIP aircraft|carrying VIPs]] on commercial flights. Its attempts to procure one [[Boeing 727]] each from domestic carriers [[Ansett Australia|Ansett]] and [[Trans Australia Airlines|TAA]] were unsuccessful but, in December, Qantas agreed to sell two [[Boeing 707]]s for $14.5 million.<ref name=Units38>RAAF Historical Section, ''Maritime and Transport Units'', pp. 38<U+2013>40</ref> Purchasing big jets for VIPs was controversial, but the 707s were also intended for general long-range transport.<ref name=Roylance>Roylance, ''Air Base Richmond'', pp. 107<U+2013>108</ref> The first was transferred to the RAAF in March 1979, and its inaugural Air Force flight took place on 22&nbsp;April. Located at [[RAAF Base Richmond]], New South Wales, the 707s were initially operated by [[No. 37 Squadron RAAF|No.&nbsp;37 Squadron]]; they were formed into No.&nbsp;33 Flight under the command of [[Wing commander (rank)|Wing Commander]] J.D. Grierson on 2&nbsp;February 1981.<ref name=Units38/><ref name=Roylance/> The flight's first mission took place the same day, when it ferried RAAF members and their families to [[RMAF Butterworth|RAAF Base Butterworth]], Malaysia, a task that had previously necessitated a Qantas charter.<ref name=Roylance/>

On 1&nbsp;July 1983, after the government procured two more 707s for $7.5 million from [[Worldways Canada]], No.&nbsp;33 Flight was reorganised as No.&nbsp;33 Squadron under Grierson's command.<ref name=Eather/><ref name=Units38/> Responsible for transporting VIPs such as members of the [[British Royal Family]], the [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]], the [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]], and the [[Pope]], the 707 also became the first RAAF aircraft to land in the [[Soviet Union]], the occasion being the funeral of [[Konstantin Chernenko]] in 1985.<ref name=Roylance/> Along with [[No. 36 Squadron RAAF|Nos.&nbsp;36]] and 37 Squadrons, operating [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules]], No.&nbsp;33 Squadron came under the control of [[No. 86 Wing RAAF|No.&nbsp;86 Wing]], part of the newly established [[Air Lift Group RAAF|Air Lift Group]], in February 1987.<ref name=Roylance/> Routine maintenance of the 707s and Hercules was the responsibility of No.&nbsp;486 Squadron, also part of No.&nbsp;86 Wing.<ref name=Roylance/><ref>RAAF Historical Section, ''Maintenance Units'', pp. 70<U+2013>71</ref> The RAAF took on another three 707s on 25&nbsp;February 1988, following a $25 million purchase from [[Boeing Defense, Space & Security|Boeing Military]]. One of the airframes was non-flying, for spares only, and was nicknamed "Hulksbury".<ref name=Units38/><ref>{{cite news|last=Lewis|first=David|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/last-raaf-707-gives-sydney-a-scare/2008/06/30/1214677946042.html|title=Last RAAF 707 gives Sydney a scare|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=1 July 2008|accessdate= 16 June 2013}}</ref>

A consortium of [[Israel Aerospace Industries]] and [[de Havilland Australia|Hawker de Havilland]] converted four of No.&nbsp;33 Squadron's six serviceable aircraft into [[aerial refueling|in-flight refuelling]] tankers between December 1988 and May 1992.<ref name=Units38/> Their probe-and-drogue configuration allowed them to refuel the RAAF's [[McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet|F/A-18 Hornets]] and the [[Royal New Zealand Air Force]]'s [[McDonnell Douglas A-4G Skyhawk|A-4 Skyhawks]], but not the RAAF's [[General Dynamics F-111C|F-111s]], which required a boom system.

The detachment subsequently refuelled US F/A-18 Hornets, [[Northrop Grumman EA-6B Prowler|EA-6 Prowler]]s, and [[McDonnell Douglas AV-8B Harrier II|AV-8 Harrier]]s, as well as RAF Harriers, in addition to the Tornados.<ref>{{cite journal|work=Air Force News, Vol. 40, No. 3|date= April 1998|page= p. 1|title= Gulf 707s operational}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.defence.gov.au/minister/1998/07398.html|title=Australian Defence Force contingent deployment to the Gulf to continue|date=8 May 1998|publisher=[[Department of Defence (Australia)|Department of Defence]]|accessdate= 16 May 2013}}</ref> From March to September 2002, two 707s formed No.&nbsp;84 Wing Detachment as part of [[Operation Slipper|Australia's contribution to the war in Afghanistan]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.defence.gov.au/minister/17tpl.cfm?CurrentId=1330|title=Farewell of 84 WG Detachment|publisher=Department of Defence|date=15 March 2002|accessdate= 18 May 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.defence.gov.au/news/raafnews/editions/4419/topstories/story01.htm|last=Caddaye|first=Ben|title=Well done|work=Air Force, Vol. 44, No. 19|date= 10 October 2002|accessdate= 18 May 2013}}</ref>  Located at [[Transit Center at Manas|Manas Air Base]] in [[Kyrgyzstan]], the 707s provided aerial refuelling to coalition aircraft operating in the theatre, their efforts earning No.&nbsp;84 Wing a [[Meritorious Unit Citation]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.defence.gov.au/health/infocentre/journals/ADFHJ_apr04/ADFHealth_5_1_bc.pdf|last=Seah|first=Mike|title=84 Wing Detachment, Ganci Air Base, Manas, Kyrgyzstan|publisher=Department of Defence|accessdate= 18 May 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.defence.gov.au/news/raafnews/editions/4419/topstories/story02.htm|title=84WG awarded unit citation|work=Air Force, Vol. 44, No. 19|date= 10 October 2002|accessdate= 18 May 2013}}</ref>
