"'''Deep Blue'''" is a song by English musician [[George Harrison]], released as the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] to his 1971 charity single "[[Bangla Desh (song)|Bangla Desh]]". Harrison wrote the song in 1970, midway through the recording sessions for ''[[All Things Must Pass]]'', and recorded it in Los Angeles the following year while organising [[the Concert for Bangladesh]]. The composition was inspired by the deteriorating condition of his mother, Louise, before she succumbed to cancer in July 1970, and by Harrison's feelings of helplessness as he visited her in hospital in the north of England. Given the subject matter of his lyrics, "Deep Blue" also served to convey the suffering endured by the millions of refugees from war-torn [[Bangladesh]] in 1971, as sickness and disease became widespread among their makeshift camps in northern India.

Following Harrison's work with American guitarist [[David Bromberg]], "Deep Blue" features sparse instrumentation in the [[Folk blues|folk-blues]] style. It includes one of Harrison's first uses of [[dobro]] on a recording. The song proved popular on US radio and was listed with the A-side when "Bangla Desh" peaked at number 23 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart.

Well regarded by music critics and commentators, "Deep Blue" was unavailable officially for 35 years after this non-album single, during which it gained a reputation as an overlooked B-side. The re-release came in September 2006, when [[EMI]] included the song as a bonus track on the reissue of Harrison's ''[[Living in the Material World]]'' album.

==Background==
[[George Harrison]]'s inspiration for writing "Deep Blue" was the fatal illness of his mother, Louise.<ref name="Clayson p 319" /> The youngest of her four children,<ref>Tillery, p. 7.</ref> Harrison often credited his mother with encouraging his music career from a young age, and a sense of individuality generally.<ref name="Olivia p 49">Olivia Harrison, p. 49.</ref><ref>The Editors of ''Rolling Stone'', pp. 21, 23.</ref> Although a practising [[Catholicism|Catholic]],<ref>Clayson, p. 20.</ref><ref>Allison, p. 17.</ref> she instilled in all her children the importance of spirituality over religion, a trait that was influential in Harrison's embracing of [[Hinduism]] in 1966.<ref>Doggett, p. 22.</ref> Louise was also diligent in replying to her son's [[fan mail]]<ref>Greene, pp. 41, 155.</ref><ref>Clayson, p. 177.</ref> and, in the words of music journalist [[John Harris (critic)|John Harris]], she "stood alone among the Beatle parents as an active champion of their talents".<ref name="Harris/Mojo">Harris, p. 72.</ref>

Harrison discussed the song at length in a 1987 interview for ''[[Musician (magazine)|Musician]]'' magazine, during which he recalls that his mother developed a [[Brain tumor|brain tumour]] late in 1969 but then recovered for seven months.<ref name="Eds of RS p 40">The Editors of ''Rolling Stone'', p. 40.</ref> After hearing of the initial diagnosis in September 1969, Harrison cancelled a recording session with [[Apple Records]] artist [[Jackie Lomax]] to see her;<ref>O'Dell, pp. 90, 96<U+2013>97.</ref> author Peter Doggett comments that, because of the severity of this news, Harrison would later have no recollection of how he heard of [[John Lennon]]'s decision to leave the Beatles, on 20 September.<ref>Doggett, pp. 101, 103.</ref>{{refn|group=nb|In [[Wonderful Today: The Autobiography|her autobiography]], however, Harrison's wife [[Pattie Boyd]] recalls that Lennon arrived unexpectedly at their house and told Harrison that he was intending to quit the band.<ref>Boyd, p. 133.</ref>}}

Although Louise's cancer had gone into remission,<ref>Tillery, p. 87.</ref> it returned in the spring of 1970.<ref>Greene, pp. 156, 178.</ref> Exhausted from nursing her, Harrison's father, Harry, was then also hospitalised.<ref name="Greene p 178">Greene, p. 178.</ref> As a result, their youngest son was "running back and forth" between [[Warrington]] and London while trying to record his first post-Beatles solo album, ''[[All Things Must Pass]]''.<ref name="Eds of RS p 40" /><ref>Clayson, p. 289.</ref> Adding to the strain, Harrison would also tell ''Musician'', he was having to assure each of his parents that the other one was okay.<ref name="Clayson p 319">Clayson, p. 319.</ref><ref name="Greene p 178" /> On 4 July, the day that his song "[[Something (Beatles song)|Something]]" won an [[Ivor Novello Awards|Ivor Novello award]],<ref>Tillery, p. 161.</ref> Harrison put his solo album on hold and drove north to see Louise for the last time.<ref name="Harris/Mojo" /><ref name="Badman p 12">Badman, p. 12.</ref> In his ''Musician'' interview, Harrison says that he wrote "Deep Blue" "at home one exhausted morning" during this period.<ref name="Eds of RS p 40" />

==Composition==
Musically, the song is in the [[Folk blues|folk-blues]] style.<ref name="Leng p 114">Leng, p. 114.</ref> Author Simon Leng notes "Deep Blue" as a comparatively rare foray into the genre for Harrison, along with "[[Sue Me, Sue You Blues]]",<ref>Leng, pp. 114, 127.</ref> a song he wrote in early 1971 in response to [[Paul McCartney]]'s lawsuit to dissolve the Beatles' partnership.<ref>Doggett, p. 157.</ref> Leng attributes the folk-blues influence primarily to [[Bob Dylan]] and American roots guitarist [[David Bromberg]], the latter of whom Harrison had met in New York, through Dylan, shortly before beginning work on ''All Things Must Pass''.<ref>Leng, pp. 73<U+2013>74, 114.</ref> Another Harrison biographer, Ian Inglis, writes that the style of "Deep Blue"'s "easy, unpretentious melody" is equally influenced by [[the Lovin' Spoonful]].<ref name="Inglis p 33" /> Harrison recalled the mix of [[Major chord|major]] and [[Minor chord|minor]] chords as reflecting the "frustration and gloom" he experienced while visiting his mother in the cancer ward.<ref name="Huntley p 74">Huntley, p. 74.</ref>

In what Inglis describes as a "poignant contrast" with the composer's Beatles track "[[Here Comes the Sun]]", Harrison sings that the sunshine brings him no relief,<ref name="Inglis p 33">Inglis, p. 33.</ref> but instead leaves him "''suffering in the darkness''", which is "''so easy come by on the roadside of one long lifetime''".<ref name="IMM p 211">George Harrison, p. 211.</ref> In his autobiography, ''[[I, Me, Mine (book)|I, Me, Mine]]'', Harrison says of the mood he captured in the song: "it's that smell and the whole atmosphere of doom that's in those hospitals."<ref name="IMM p 212">George Harrison, p. 212.</ref>

{{quote box|quote= ["Deep Blue" is] filled with frustration and gloom of going to these hospitals and the feeling of disease that permeated the atmosphere. Not being able to do anything for suffering family or loved ones is an awful experience.<ref name="Eds of RS p 40" />|source= <U+2013> Harrison to ''[[Musician (magazine)|Musician]]'', November 1987|width=20%|align=right|style=padding:8px;}}
The lyrics bear out the powerlessness he felt while someone dear to him passed away,<ref name="Greene p 178" /><ref name="Inglis p 33" /> specifically in the second verse:<ref name="IMM p 211" />

{{quote|text=''When you stand there, watch tired bodies <br> Full of sickness and pain to show you <br> Just how helpless you really are&nbsp;...''}}

Harrison was at Louise's bedside until her death on 7 July.<ref name="Badman p 12" /><ref>Tillery, pp. 79, 161.</ref> According to ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' contributor [[Mikal Gilmore]], he read passages to her from a text about the [[Bhagavad Gita]], "commenting on the sacred book's views of death as a changeover rather than a termination".<ref name="Eds of RS p 40" /> In "Deep Blue"'s final verse, Harrison's lyrics likewise focus on spirituality:<ref>Allison, pp. 90, 140.</ref>

{{quote|text=''When I think of the life I'm living <br> Pray God help me, give me your light <br> So I can love you and understand <br> This repetition that keeps me here feeling deep blue&nbsp;...''}}

Harrison was alone with his mother at the end, author Joshua Greene writes, and when she began to slip into unconsciousness, he "put down the book and began [[Chant#Chant as a spiritual practice|chanting]] softly into her ear".<ref name="Greene p 178" /> Inglis views the lyrics to "Deep Blue" as exemplifying Harrison's "fondness for family".<ref>Inglis, p. 141.</ref>{{refn|group=nb|Another track that Inglis highlights among its composer's family-oriented songs is "[[Unknown Delight]]",<ref>Inglis, pp. 82, 141.</ref> written about the birth of Harrison's son, [[Dhani Harrison|Dhani]].<ref>Allison, pp. 65, 158.</ref>}} [[Pattie Boyd]], Harrison's wife at the time, recalls that Louise had withheld the seriousness of her condition from him for eight weeks before September 1969, "in case George was busy" with his career, and that, following her death, Harrison was anxious about how his father would manage alone.<ref>Boyd, pp. 133, 134.</ref> Keen to strengthen the familial bond, Harrison invited his brothers Harold and Pete to live on his [[Friar Park]] estate in Oxfordshire,<ref>Greene, pp. 178<U+2013>79.</ref> along with their father.<ref name="Boyd p 134" />

==Recording==
Within a year of Louise Harrison's death, Harry was staying in Los Angeles with Harrison and Boyd,<ref name="Boyd p 134">Boyd, p. 134.</ref><ref>O'Dell, p. 192.</ref> while Harrison worked with [[Ravi Shankar]] on the soundtrack to the film ''[[Raga (film)|Raga]]''.<ref name="Lavezzoli p 187" /><ref>Harvey Kubernik, [http://www.rocksbackpages.com/Library/Article/with-a-little-help-from-his-friends-george-harrison-and-the-concert-for-bangla-desh "With a Little Help from His Friends: George Harrison and the Concert for Bangla Desh"], [[Rock's Backpages|Rock's Backpages Archive]], July 2011 (''subscription required''; retrieved 24 August 2014).</ref> A [[Bengali Hindu]], Shankar was distraught at the news of the humanitarian disaster then occurring in [[East Pakistan]],<ref>Clayson, pp. 307<U+2013>08.</ref> following the outbreak of the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] in March 1971.<ref name="Lavezzoli p 187">Lavezzoli, p. 187.</ref><ref>The Editors of ''Rolling Stone'', p. 123.</ref> After fleeing the war zone in their homeland, an estimated 7 million<ref>Schaffner, p. 146.</ref> refugees were being accommodated in inadequate camps in India, where diseases such as [[cholera]] had become rife.<ref>Greene, pp. 185<U+2013>86.</ref><ref name="CforBD booklet">Liner notes, booklet accompanying ''[[The Concert for Bangladesh (album)|The Concert for Bangladesh]]'' reissue ([[Sony BMG]], 2005; produced by George Harrison & Phil Spector), pp. 6<U+2013>7.</ref> Shankar later recalled that Harrison was deeply moved by his request for help in aiding the [[Bengali people|Bengali]] refugees,<ref>Olivia Harrison, p. 286.</ref><ref>Shankar, p. 219.</ref> as a result of which he committed to staging [[the Concert for Bangladesh]] in New York that summer.<ref>Huntley, pp. 72<U+2013>73.</ref><ref>Rodriguez, pp. 43, 48.</ref> Author Elliot Huntley suggests that, having been incapable of assuaging his mother's pain as she lay dying in 1970, Harrison gained extra motivation from "a situation his fame and commercial cache ''could'' do something to alleviate".<ref>Huntley, pp. 73<U+2013>74.</ref>

==Release==
[[File:George Harrison - Bangla Desh.png|thumb|right|150px|Trade ad for the "Bangla Desh" single, August 1971]]
Apple Records issued the "Bangla Desh" / "Deep Blue" single on 28 July 1971 in the United States (as Apple 1836) and 30 July in Britain (R 5912).<ref>Castleman & Podrazik, p. 103.</ref> Before then, Apple's US distributor, [[Capitol Records]], had manufactured one-sided promo discs, featuring just "Bangla Desh",<ref name="Spizer p 236" /> with the result that the lead side had already received considerable airplay in the build-up to the concerts.<ref>Clayson, p. 312.</ref> The release was accompanied by a trade advertisement that reflected the emotion conveyed in "Deep Blue", of someone watching a loved one "waste away", Spizer writes; in this case, the image depicted a mother attempting to comfort her starving child.<ref>Spizer, pp. 234, 236.</ref>

The B-side was a popular track in its own right at the time of release.<ref name="Clayson p 319" /> By 11 September, when the single reached its peak position on America's [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]],<ref>Castleman & Podrazik, p. 352.</ref> at number 23,<ref name="Billboard_singles">[http://www.allmusic.com/artist/george-harrison-mn0000209142/awards "George Harrison > Charts & Awards > Billboard Singles"], [[AllMusic]] (retrieved 27 July 2014).</ref> radio programmers had opted for "Deep Blue" and the entry appeared as a [[double A-side]] in the chart listings. The single enjoyed more success on the other two US national charts, peaking at number 20 on ''[[Cash Box]]'' and number 13 on ''[[Record World]]''.<ref name="Spizer p 235">Spizer, p. 235.</ref>

==Reissue==
The 1971 single remained the only official release for "Deep Blue" for over 30 years,<ref name="Madinger & Easter p 435">Madinger & Easter, p. 435.</ref> during which the song was largely forgotten.<ref name="Huntley p 74" /> In his conversations with [[Derek Taylor]] over 1978<U+2013>79 for ''I, Me, Mine'', Harrison acknowledged that the track had become "a bit obscure".<ref>George Harrison, pp. 64, 212.</ref> Inglis suggests that its exclusion from any album releases was because the lyrics' "raw imagery" confined the track to a "very specific personal and political relevance" within the Bangladesh context.<ref name="Inglis p 34" />

After the expiration of Harrison's contract with Capitol in 1976, this and other non-album B-sides were among the notable omissions from ''[[The Best of George Harrison]]'',<ref>Rodriguez, pp. 126, 128.</ref> a compilation that ignored many popular songs from his solo career in favour of an [[LP record|LP]] side of Beatles tracks.<ref>Huntley, p. 151.</ref><ref name=autogenerated4>Stephen Thomas Erlewine, [http://www.allmusic.com/album/r8996/review "George Harrison ''The Best of George Harrison''"], [[AllMusic]] (retrieved 23 August 2014).</ref> That same year, Harrison signed with [[Warner Bros. Records]],<ref>Badman, pp. 194, 197.</ref> whose staff producer [[Ted Templeman]] expressed his admiration for "Deep Blue".<ref>Mick Brown, "An Interview with George Harrison", ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', 19 April 1979; available at [http://www.rocksbackpages.com/article.html?ArticleID=2533 Rock's Backpages] (''subscription required''; retrieved 23 August 2014).</ref> As a result, Harrison wrote a song in the same musical style, the more upbeat "Soft-Hearted Hana", for his 1979 album ''[[George Harrison (album)|George Harrison]]''.<ref>George Harrison, p. 352.</ref><ref>Rodriguez, pp. 175, 177.</ref>

From the mid 1990s, "Deep Blue" became available on Harrison [[Bootleg recording|bootleg]] compilations such as ''Pirate Songs'' and ''Through Many Years''.<ref>Madinger & Easter, pp. 435, 442.</ref> Along with "[[Miss O'Dell]]", a song he wrote in Los Angeles partly about the Bangladesh crisis,<ref>Clayson, p. 317.</ref><ref name="Mellis/Consequence">Len Comaratta, [https://web.archive.org/web/20140710203547/http://consequenceofsound.net/2012/12/dusting-em-off-george-harrison-and-friends-the-concert-for-bangladesh/ "Dusting 'Em Off: George Harrison and Friends <U+2013> The Concert For Bangladesh"], [[Consequence of Sound]], 29 December 2012 (archived version retrieved 22 August 2014).</ref> it was finally given an official CD release in September 2006,<ref>Mat Snow, "George Harrison ''Living in the Material World''", ''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]'', November 2006, p. 124.</ref> as a [[bonus track]] on Harrison's remastered ''[[Living in the Material World]]'' album.<ref name="John Metzger/MB">John Metzger, [http://www.musicbox-online.com/reviews-2006/georgeharrison-livinginthematerialworld.html#axzz20rOE4V00 "George Harrison ''Living in the Material World''"], ''The Music Box'', vol. 13 (11), November 2006 (retrieved 25 July 2014).</ref> "Deep Blue" also appears on the 2014 ''[[The Apple Years 1968<U+2013>75|Apple Years 1968<U+2013>75]]'' reissue of the album.<ref>Joe Marchese, [http://theseconddisc.com/2014/09/23/review-the-george-harrison-remasters-the-apple-years-1968-1975/ "Review: The George Harrison Remasters <U+2013> 'The Apple Years 1968<U+2013>1975'"], The Second Disc, 23 September 2014 (retrieved 27 September 2014).</ref>

==Reception==
"Deep Blue" impressed the notably anti-Harrison<ref name="RS GH bio">[http://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/george-harrison/biography "George Harrison biography"], [[Rolling Stone|rollingstone.com]] (retrieved 26 July 2014).</ref> ''[[Village Voice]]'' critic [[Robert Christgau]], who considered the song on a par with "Here Comes the Sun" and "[[My Sweet Lord]]", while noting its status as a track "hidden away" on a B-side.<ref name=Christgau>Robert Christgau, [http://robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?id=1983&name=George+Harrison "Consumer Guide Reviews: George Harrison" > Thirty-Three & 1/3], [[Robert Christgau|robertchristgau.com]] (retrieved 26 July 2014).</ref> In their 2000 book on the four ex-Beatles' solo recordings, Chip Madinger and Mark Easter wrote of "Deep Blue": "The track's understated instrumentation and perceptive lyrical content make this one of the best, yet most overlooked songs in George's catalog."<ref name="Madinger & Easter p 435" /> In a 2001 appraisal of Harrison's Apple recordings, for ''[[Record Collector]]'', Peter Doggett opined that Harrison had "tucked away an acoustic gem" on the B-side to "Bangla Desh" and described the song as "a sad but still buoyant lament inspired by his regular visits to his dying mother's bedside".<ref>Peter Doggett, "The Apple Years", ''[[Record Collector]]'', April 2001, p. 37.</ref>

Among reviews of the ''Living in the Material World'' reissue, John Metzger of ''The Music Box'' describes "Deep Blue" as a "loose, swinging acoustic blues".<ref name="John Metzger/MB" /> Writing for [[AllMusic]], Bruce Eder views it as an "important bonus track", as well as "a fantastic showcase" for Harrison's acoustic guitar playing.<ref>Bruce Eder, [http://www.allmusic.com/album/release/living-in-the-material-world-bonus-tracks-dvd-mr0001108727 "George Harrison ''Living in the Material World'' (Bonus Tracks/DVD)"], [[AllMusic]] (retrieved 4 October 2014).</ref> In a review of the ''Apple Years'' reissues, ''[[New Zealand Herald]]'' music critic [[Graham Reid (journalist)|Graham Reid]] describes the song as an "especially good" B-side.<ref>Graham Reid, [http://www.elsewhere.co.nz/absoluteelsewhere/6583/george-harrison-revisited-part-one-2014-the-dark-horse-bolting-out-of-the-gate/ "George Harrison Revisited, Part One (2014): The dark horse bolting out of the gate"], [[Elsewhere (website)|Elsewhere]], 24 October 2014 (retrieved 4 December 2014).</ref>

Theologian [[Dale Allison]] recognises "Deep Blue" as Harrison's "musically beautiful and lyrically moving" response to his mother's death, a "prayer to God for help, light, love, and understanding in the midst of personal grief".<ref name="Allison p 140">Allison, p. 140.</ref> Ian Inglis praises the song's "uncluttered production and economical backing", adding: "'Deep Blue' is unlike anything he had written or recorded at that time, and its relative obscurity is undeserved."<ref>Inglis, p. 34, 45.</ref> While comparing the song favourably with better-known compositions by Lennon ("[[Julia (The Beatles song)|Julia]]") and McCartney ("[[Yesterday (Beatles song)|Yesterday]]", "[[Let It Be (song)|Let It Be]]"), Inglis concludes: "Where they differ is that Harrison's song is about himself as much as it is about his mother; her death is a starting point for an exploration of the 'suffering' and 'darkness' that afflict us all."<ref name="Inglis p 34">Inglis, p. 34.</ref> Elliot Huntley describes it as "a plaintive acoustic guitar tune" that became an "unjustly overlooked B-side".<ref name="Huntley p 74" />

Simon Leng sees "Deep Blue" as a candidate for what he terms "the 'last great B-side' accolade", rivalling Harrison's Beatles tracks "[[The Inner Light (song)|The Inner Light]]" and "[[Old Brown Shoe]]". Leng also considers it to be a "worthy companion" to Dylan's ''[[New Morning]]'' album and the work of Bromberg and [[Ry Cooder]].<ref name="Leng pp 113-14" />
