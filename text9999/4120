==Expansion==
In October 2012 the museum scaled back its plans in order to complete the last phase of a three year expansion announced in 2008.<ref>{{cite web| title=Museum unveils expansion | publisher=Evansville Courier & Press | url=http://www.courierpress.com/news/2008/may/23/museum-unveils-expansion/ | accessdate=2008-09-19}}</ref> The modified plan calls for a glass walled, rectangular addition with a domed immersive planetarium and theater. The domed theater will lie entirely inside the building box, visible from the exterior. A pedestrian-friendly plaza and new museum entrance will connect the addition to parking and the Evansville Museum Transportation Center.  The expansion, which began with repairs, renovations and additions to its existing building will be completed at a cost of $14.1 million.<ref>{{cite web| title= Museum cuts $3 million from expansion to speed construction | publisher=Evansville Courier & Press | url=http://www.courierpress.com/news/2012/oct/18/no-headline---museum/ | accessdate=2013-08-31}}</ref>
