'''SS ''Iowan''''' was a [[cargo ship]] built in 1914 for the [[American-Hawaiian Steamship Company]]. During [[World War I]] she was taken over by the [[United States Navy]] and [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] as '''USS ''Iowan'' (ID-3002)'''. During [[World War II]], the ship was transferred to the [[Soviet Union]] and renamed '''SS ''Tashkent''''' (or '''''<U+0422><U+0430><U+0448><U+043A><U+0435><U+043D><U+0442>''''' in [[Cyrillic alphabet|Cyrillic]]).

''Iowan'' was built by the [[Maryland Steel Company]] as one of eight sister ships for the American-Hawaiian Steamship Company. In October 1914, five months after she was delivered to American-Hawaiian, ''Iowan'' rammed and sank the [[United Fruit Company]] steamer ''Metapan'' near the entrance to New York Harbor. After repairs, ''Iowan'' resumed inter-coastal service via the [[Panama Canal]]. When the canal was temporarily closed by landslides in late 1915, ''Iowan'' sailed via the [[Straits of Magellan]] until the canal reopened in mid 1916. During World War I, USS ''Iowan'' carried cargo, animals, and a limited number of passengers to France, and returned nearly 10,000 American troops after the [[Armistice with Germany|Armistice]].

After her Navy service ended in 1919, she was returned to her original owners, who, at least once, [[ship chartering|chartered]] her to another shipping company. In May 1922, ''Iowan'' rammed and sank the Furness-Prince Line steamer ''Welsh Prince'' in the [[Columbia River]] near [[Astoria, Oregon]], killing seven men in the process. In June 1941, ''Iowan'' ran aground on a reef near [[Point Conception|Point Conception, California]], and suffered $500,000 in damages while buffeted by waves on the reef. She was freed from the reef after two weeks, towed to [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], and repaired.

In 1942, the ship was requisitioned by the [[War Shipping Administration]], which transferred her to the Soviet Union under the terms of [[Lend-Lease]] in December 1942. She was assigned to the [[Far East Shipping Company]] under her new name of SS&nbsp;''Tashkent'', but sailed with the [[Soviet Pacific Fleet]] throughout the war. She delivered cargo and troops in support of the [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria|Soviet invasion]] of [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]]-held territories in August 1945. After the war, the ship remained a part of the Soviet [[merchant fleet]] until 1966. She was transferred to [[North Korea]] at that time to become a fish processing facility, and was scrapped in 1969.

==Design and construction==
In May 1912, the [[American-Hawaiian Steamship Company]] placed an order with the [[Maryland Steel Company]] of [[Sparrows Point, Maryland]], for two new [[cargo ships]]<U+2014>''Iowan'' and {{SS|Ohioan|1914|2}}.<ref group=Note>[[Maryland Steel Company|Maryland Steel]] had built three ships<U+2014>{{SS|Kentuckian||2}}, ''Georgian'', and ''Honolulan''<U+2014>for American-Hawaiian in 1909 in what proved to be a satisfactory arrangement for both companies. In September 1911 and November 1912, American-Hawaiian placed an order for ''Iowan''{{'}}s six older sister ships; {{SS|Minnesotan||2}}, {{SS|Dakotan||2}}, {{SS|Montanan||2}}, and {{SS|Pennsylvanian||2}} in the earlier order, {{SS|Washingtonian||2}} and {{SS|Panaman||2}} in the latter.</ref> The contract cost of the ships was set at the construction cost plus an 8% profit for Maryland Steel, but with a maximum cost of $640,000 per ship. The construction was financed by Maryland Steel with a credit plan that called for a 5% down payment in cash with nine monthly installments for the balance. Provisions of the deal allowed that some of the nine installments could be converted into longer-term notes or mortgages. The final cost of ''Iowan'', including financing costs, was $71.95 per [[deadweight tonnage|deadweight ton]], which came out to just over $732,000.<ref name=Cochran-358 />

''Iowan'' (Maryland Steel yard no. 132)<ref name=Colton /> was the first ship built under the contract. She was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on 24 January 1914,<ref name=Miramar /> and delivered to American-Hawaiian on 16 May.<ref name=Colton /> The ship was {{GRT|6,529|first=yes}},<ref name=Cochran-365 /> and was {{convert|407|ft|7|in|m}} in length ([[length between perpendiculars|between perpendiculars]]) and {{convert|53|ft|6|in|m}} [[beam (nautical)|abeam]].<ref name=Miramar /> She had a [[deadweight tonnage]] of {{DWT|10,175|long}},<ref name=Cochran-365 /> and her cargo holds, which had a storage capacity of {{convert|490859|cuft}},<ref name=Cochran-365 /> were outfitted with a complete refrigeration plant so that she could carry perishable products from the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]]<U+2014>like fresh produce from [[Southern California]] farms<U+2014>to the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]].<ref name=LAT-california_cargo>{{cite news | title = California cargo of produce shipped to East | work = [[Los Angeles Times]] | date = 3 October 1914 | page = II-8 }}</ref> ''Iowan'' had a single [[steam engine]] powered by oil-fired [[boiler]]s that drove a single [[screw propeller]] at a speed of {{convert|14|knots|km/h}}.<!-- speed --><ref name=Miramar /><ref name="Cochran-357"/><!--oil-fired, single screw -->

==Early career==
When ''Iowan'' began sailing for American-Hawaiian, the company shipped cargo from [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] ports via the [[Straits of Magellan]] to [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] ports and [[Hawaii]], and vice versa.<ref group=Note>Prior to the 21 April 1914 [[United States occupation of Veracruz]], American-Hawaiian had used the Tehuantepec Route, but after the U.S. action, that route was closed by the [[Victoriano Huerta|Huerta]]-led Mexican government. Shipments on that Tehuantepec Route would arrive at [[Mexico|Mexican]] ports<U+2014>[[Salina Cruz|Salina Cruz, Oaxaca]], for eastbound cargo, and [[Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz]], for westbound cargo<U+2014>and would traverse the [[Isthmus of Tehuantepec]] on the [[Tehuantepec National Railway]]. See: Hovey, p. 78.</ref> Eastbound shipments were primarily sugar and pineapple from Hawaii, while westbound cargoes were more general in nature.<ref name=Cochran-355-56>Cochran and Ginger, p. 355<U+2013>56.</ref> With the opening of the Panama Canal on 15 August 1914, American-Hawaiian ships switched to taking that route.<ref name=Cochran-360>Cochran and Ginger, p. 360.</ref>

At 15:20 on 15 October 1914, the outbound ''Iowan'' rammed the [[United Fruit Company]] passenger and cargo steamer ''Metapan'' at the entrance of [[Ambrose Channel]] outside of New York. ''Metapan'' had stopped in the dense fog, but ''Iowan'' was traveling at a rapid pace. When ''Iowan'' had appeared out of the fog some {{convert|200|to|300|yd|m}} from ''Metapan'', the United Fruit ship sounded three blasts on the ship's [[steam whistle|whistle]]<U+2014>warning ''Iowan'' of the impending collision. ''Iowan''{{'}}s captain did not alter the ship's course, but did drop her anchor to try and slow the fully laden ship. Nevertheless, ''Iowan'' gashed the bow of ''Metapan'' and traveled almost halfway through the passenger ship. When ''Iowan'' pulled out three minutes later, ''Metapan'' began to sink rapidly. ''Metapan''{{'}}s captain ordered his ship to sail at full speed for shoals some {{convert|200|yd|m}} distant, on which the ship grounded in {{convert|18|ft|m}} of water. A variety of craft<U+2014>including the nearby British [[Royal Navy]] [[cruiser]] {{HMS|Lancaster|1902|2}}<U+2014>responded to ''Metapan''{{'}}s [[SOS]]. Even though the ship was resting on the bottom and the passengers in no immediate danger, most of the 78<U+00A0>passengers and 90<U+00A0>crewmen evacuated the ship in lifeboats and were picked up by rescue craft.<ref group=Note>''Metapan'' had been carrying $500,000 in gold bars from [[Colombia]] and was also transporting [[J. Campbell Besley]]'s scientific expedition returning from [[Peru]] with two [[Inca]]n mummies, Incan jewelry and other artifacts, and {{convert|10000|ft|m}} of motion pictures documenting their finds.

[[File:SS Metapan sunk by the SS Iowan.JPG|thumb|left|{{SS|Metapan}} sinking after being rammed by ''Iowan'' in 1914]]
After repairs and return to service, ''Iowan'' resumed her inter-coastal service. In May 1915, she was delayed by a large Pacific storm that was responsible for the sinking of the steamer ''Victoria'', and also damaged {{SS|Northern Pacific||2}} and {{SS|Harvard||2}}.<ref>{{cite news | title = Big storm subsiding | work = Los Angeles Times | date = 2 May 1915 | page = I-1 }}</ref> In mid-September the same year, ''Iowan'' sailed from [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] for the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]].

The balance of ''Iowan''{{'}}s activities over the next two years are unclear. She may have been in the half of the American-Hawaiian fleet that was [[ship chartering|chartered]] for transatlantic service. She may also have been in the group of American-Hawaiian ships chartered for service to South America, delivering coal, gasoline, and steel in exchange for coffee, [[nitrate]]s, cocoa, rubber, and [[manganese|manganese ore]].<ref name=Cochran-362>Cochran and Ginger, p. 362.</ref>

==World War I==
On 23 December 1917, some seven months after the United States declared war on [[German Empire|Germany]], the [[United States Navy]] acquired ''Iowan'' from American-Hawaiian. USS ''Iowan'' was [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] the same day with [[Lieutenant Commander (United States)|Lieutenant Commander]] Frank L. Dow, <small>[[United States Naval Reserve Forces|USNRF]]</small>, in command.<ref name=DANFS />

[[Image:U. S. Field Artillery in Chateau-Thierry.jpg|thumb|right|In her U.S. Navy service during [[World War I]], ''Iowan'' transported [[horse]]s for use by the [[American Expeditionary Force]], like these seen here with a U.S. [[field artillery]] unit at [[Ch<U+00E2>teau-Thierry]].]]
''Iowan'' loaded a cargo of 800<U+00A0>horses,<ref name=NNVet>{{Cite web| last = Krenzelok | first = Greg | title = Newport News Animal Transport ship List overseas to France during WW1 | url = http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~gregkrenzelok/veterinary%20corp%20in%20ww1/newportnewsshiplist.html | accessdate = 25 August 2008 }}</ref> along with flour, iron, and machinery at [[Newport News, Virginia]] and sailed for [[New York City|New York]] on 9 February 1918.

With the fighting at an end, the task of bringing home American soldiers began almost immediately.<ref name=Gleaves-31>Gleaves, p. 31.</ref> ''Iowan'' was selected for conversion to a [[troop transport]] and transferred to the [[Cruiser and Transport Force]],<ref name=Gleaves-256-57 /> but before she could begin returning troops, ''Iowan'' had to undergo conversion from a cargo and animal ship. Though sources do not indicate the specific modifications ''Iowan'' underwent, typical conversions for other ships included the installation of berths for troops, and adding greatly expanded cooking and toilet facilities to handle the large numbers of men aboard.<ref>Crowell and Wilson, p. 316.</ref> Similar modifications on ''Iowan''{{'}}s sister ship {{USS|Minnesotan|ID-4545|2}} took three months,<ref name=DANFS-Minn>{{cite DANFS | author = [[Naval Historical Center]] | title = Minnesotan | url = http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/m11/minnesotan.htm | short = on }}</ref> but it is not known how long ''Iowan''{{'}}s refit took. By the time ''Iowan'' had completed her sixth and final trooping voyage on 29 August 1919, ''Iowan'' had carried home 9,876 healthy and wounded men.<ref name=Gleaves-256-57 /> USS ''Iowan'' was decommissioned on 22 September 1919, and returned to American-Hawaiian.<ref name=DANFS />

==Interwar years==
''Iowan'' resumed cargo service with American-Hawaiian after her return from World War I service. Though the company had abandoned its original Hawaiian sugar routes by this time,<ref>Cochran and Ginger, p. 363</ref> ''Iowan'' continued inter-coastal service through the Panama Canal.	For a time in the early 1920s, ''Iowan'' was [[ship chartering|chartered]] to the [[United American Line]]. In May 1922, the [[Associated Press]] reported that ''Iowan'', sailing under the United American banner, was loading wheat, flour, and lumber at [[Tacoma, Washington]], for England and European ports.<ref>{{cite news | agency = [[Associated Press]] | title = News of ships and sailings in Pacific ports | work = Los Angeles Times | date = 21 May 1922 | page = I-11 }}</ref> Later that same month, on 29 May, ''Iowan'' rammed and sank the Furness-Prince Line cargo ship ''Welsh Prince'' in the [[Columbia River]] near [[Astoria, Oregon]]. Seven men aboard ''Welsh Prince'' were killed and three were injured in the crash and subsequent fire.<ref name=NYT-seven_in />

On 11 June 1941, ''Iowan'' departed Los Angeles with a cargo of {{convert|4500|LT|t}} of steel and iron pipe destined for San Francisco; [[Portland, Oregon]]; and [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]], on her last voyage before she was to be handed over to the [[United States Maritime Commission]].<ref name=LAT-SN_0629>{{cite news | last = Austin | first = Tom | title = Shipping news and activities at Los Angeles Harbor | work = Los Angeles Times | date = 29 June 1941 | page = 19 }}</ref> At 04:20 on 12 June, ''Iowan'' ran aground on a reef a few hundred yards (meters) off shore from Government Point,<ref name=LAT-defense_cargo>{{cite news | title = Defense cargo ship crashes on reef in foggy weather | work = Los Angeles Times | date = 13 June 1941 | page = A1 }}</ref><U+2014>{{convert|117|nmi|km}} northwest of Los Angeles,<ref name=LAT-more_help>{{cite news | title = More help on way to vessel on reef off Government Point | work = Los Angeles Times | date = 14 June 1941 | page = A1 }}</ref><U+2014>near [[Point Conception]].<ref name=LAT-defense_cargo /> Salvage operations took some two weeks, but the ship was towed back to Los Angeles and placed in drydock at the [[Bethlehem Shipyard]] on [[Terminal Island]]. Approximately {{convert|100|ft|m}} of the ship's hull had been damaged while the ship was buffeted by waves on the reef, which had opened numerous holes in her [[hull (watercraft)|hull]]. The ship's drive shaft had broken, and her boilers and engines had shifted. The ''Los Angeles Times'' reported that estimates for ''Iowan''{{'}}s repair ranged up to $500,000.<ref name=LAT-grounded_ship>{{cite news | title = Grounded ship's damage estimated | work = Los Angeles Times | date  = 1 July 1941 | page = A14 }}</ref> In an inquiry held by the [[Bureau of Marine Inspection and Navigation]], ''Iowan''{{'}}s captain, S.
