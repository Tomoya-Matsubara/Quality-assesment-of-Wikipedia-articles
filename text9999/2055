The '''political career of [[John C. Breckinridge]]''' included service in the state government of [[Kentucky]], the [[Federal government of the United States|United States federal government]], and the government of the [[Confederate States of America]]. In 1857, at 36 years old, he was inaugurated as [[James Buchanan]]'s [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]], and remains the youngest person to ever hold the office. Four years later, he ran as the presidential candidate of a dissident group of [[Southern Democrats]], but [[United States presidential election, 1860|lost the election]] to the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidate, [[Abraham Lincoln]].

A member of the [[Breckinridge family|Breckinridge political family]], in 1849 John C. Breckinridge became the first [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] to represent [[Fayette County, Kentucky|Fayette County]] in the [[Kentucky House of Representatives]], and in 1851, he was the first Democrat to represent [[Kentucky's 8th congressional district]] in over 20 years. A champion of [[strict constructionism]], [[states' rights]], and [[popular sovereignty]], he supported [[Stephen A. Douglas]]'s [[Kansas<U+2013>Nebraska Act]] as a means of addressing [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] in the territories acquired by the U.S. in the [[Mexican<U+2013>American War]]. Considering his re-election to the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] unlikely in 1854, he returned to private life and his legal practice. He was nominated for vice president at the [[1856 Democratic National Convention]], and although he and Buchanan [[United States presidential election, 1856|won the election]], he enjoyed little influence in Buchanan's administration. 

In 1859, the [[Kentucky General Assembly]] elected Breckinridge to a [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] term that would begin in 1861. In the 1860 presidential contest, he captured the [[United States Electoral College|electoral votes]] of most of the [[Southern United States|Southern states]], but finished a distant second among four candidates. Lincoln's election as president prompted the [[Secession in the United States|secession]] of the Southern states to form the Confederate States of America. Though Breckinridge sympathized with the Southern cause, in the Senate he worked futilely to reunite the states peacefully. After the [[Battle of Fort Sumter|Confederates fired on Fort Sumter]], beginning the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], he opposed allocating resources for Lincoln to fight the Confederacy. Fearing arrest after Kentucky sided with the Union, he fled to the Confederacy, joined the [[Confederate States Army]], and was subsequently expelled from the Senate. He served in the Confederate Army from October 1861 to February 1865, when [[President of the Confederate States of America|Confederate President]] [[Jefferson Davis]] appointed him [[Confederate States Secretary of War]]. Concluding that the Confederate cause was hopeless, he encouraged Davis to negotiate a national surrender. Davis's capture in April 1865 ended the war, and Breckinridge fled to [[Cuba]], then [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]], and finally [[Canada]], remaining in exile until President [[Andrew Johnson]]'s offer of amnesty in 1868. Returning to Kentucky, he refused all requests to resume his political career and died of complications related to war injuries in 1875.

[[File:John-Breckinridge-portrait.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=A man with black hair wearing a black jacket over a high-collared white shirt|Breckinridge's grandfather, U.S. Attorney General John Breckinridge, influenced his political philosophy.]]
Historian James Klotter has speculated that, had John C. Breckinridge's father, [[Cabell Breckinridge|Cabell]], lived, he would have steered his son to the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] and the Union, rather than the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]], but the [[Secretary of State of Kentucky|Kentucky Secretary of State]] and former Speaker of the [[Kentucky House of Representatives]] died of a fever on September 1, 1823, months before his son's third birthday.<ref>Klotter, pp. 96&ndash;97</ref> Burdened with her husband's debts, widow Mary Breckinridge and her children moved to her in-laws' home near [[Lexington, Kentucky]], where John C. Breckinridge's grandmother taught him the political philosophies of his late grandfather, [[United States Attorney General|U.S. Attorney General]] [[John Breckinridge (U.S. Attorney General)|John Breckinridge]].<ref name=klotter97>Klotter in ''The Breckinridges of Kentucky'', p. 97</ref> John Breckinridge believed the federal government was created by, and subject to, the co-equal governments of the states.<ref name=klotter108>Klotter, p. 108</ref> As a state representative, he introduced the [[Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions|Kentucky Resolutions]] of 1798 and 1799, which denounced the [[Alien and Sedition Acts]] and asserted that states could [[Nullification (U.S. Constitution)|nullify]] them and other federal laws that they deemed unconstitutional.<ref name=heck1>Heck, p. 1</ref> A [[strict constructionism|strict constructionist]], he held that the federal government could only exercise powers explicitly given to it in the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]].<ref name=heck1 />

Most of the Breckinridges were Whigs, but John Breckinridge's posthumous influence inclined his grandson toward the Democratic Party.<ref name=ewb>"John Cabell Breckinridge". ''Encyclopedia of World Biography''</ref><ref name=klotter103>Klotter in ''The Breckinridges of Kentucky'', p. 103</ref> Additionally, John C. Breckinridge's friend and law partner, Thomas W. Bullock, was from a Democratic family.<ref>Heck, pp. 11, 13</ref> In 1842, Bullock told Breckinridge that by the time they opened their practice in [[Burlington, Iowa]], "you were two-thirds of a Democrat"; living in heavily Democratic [[Iowa Territory]] further distanced him from [[Whig history|Whiggery]].<ref name=davis27>Davis, p. 27</ref> He wrote weekly editorials in the Democratic ''Iowa Territorial Gazette and Advisor'', and in February 1843, he was named to the [[Des Moines County, Iowa|Des Moines County]] Democratic committee.<ref name=heck14 /> A letter from Breckinridge's brother-in-law related that, when Breckinridge's uncle William learned that his nephew had "become loco-foco",<ref group=note>"Loco-foco" was by then a derogatory term used by Whigs to describe the Democratic Party; see [[locofocos]].</ref> he said, "I felt as I would have done if I had heard that my daughter had been dishonored."<ref name=heck14>Heck, p. 14</ref> On a visit to Kentucky in 1843, Breckinridge met and married [[Mary Cyrene Burch Breckinridge|Mary Cyrene Burch]], ending his time in Iowa.<ref name=heck15>Heck, p. 15</ref>

==Views on slavery==
Slavery issues dominated Breckinridge's political career, although historians disagree about Breckinridge's views.  In ''Breckinridge: Statesman, Soldier, Symbol'', [[William C. Davis (historian)|William C. Davis]] argues that, by adulthood, Breckinridge regarded slavery as evil; his entry in the 2002 ''Encyclopedia of World Biography'' records that he advocated [[manumission|voluntary emancipation]].<ref name=ewb /><ref name=davis19>Davis, p. 19</ref> In ''Proud Kentuckian: John C. Breckinridge 1821&ndash;1875'', Frank Heck disagrees, citing Breckinridge's consistent advocacy for slavery protections, beginning with his opposition to emancipationist candidates &ndash; including his uncle, [[Robert Jefferson Breckinridge]] &ndash; in the state elections of 1849.<ref name=heck163>Heck, p. 163</ref>

===Early influences===
''See also [[John C. Breckinridge#Early life|John C. Breckinridge: Early life]]''

Breckinridge's grandfather, John, owned slaves, believing it was a necessary evil in an agrarian economy.<ref name=davis5>Davis, p. 5</ref> He hoped for gradual emancipation but did not believe the federal government was empowered to effect it; Davis wrote that this became "family doctrine".<ref name=davis5 /> As a U.S. Senator, John Breckinridge insisted that decisions about slavery in [[Louisiana Territory]] be left to its future inhabitants, essentially the "[[popular sovereignty]]" advocated by John C. Breckinridge prior to the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].<ref name=davis7>Davis, p. 7</ref> John C. Breckinridge's father, Cabell, embraced gradual emancipation and opposed government interference with slavery, but Cabell's brother Robert, a [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] minister, became an [[abolitionism|abolitionist]], concluding that slavery was morally wrong.<ref name=davis8>Davis, p. 8</ref><ref name=klotter109>Klotter in ''The Breckinridges of Kentucky'', p. 109</ref> Davis recorded that all the Breckinridges were pleased when the [[Kentucky General Assembly|General Assembly]] refused to repeal the ban on importing slaves to Kentucky in 1833.<ref name=davis17>Davis, p. 17</ref>

John C. Breckinridge encountered conflicting influences as an undergraduate at [[Centre College]] and in law school at [[Transylvania University]].<ref name=davis1417>Davis, pp. 14, 17</ref> Centre President John C. Young, Breckinridge's brother-in-law, believed in states' rights and gradual emancipation, as did [[George Robertson (congressman)|George Robertson]], one of Breckinridge's instructors at Transylvania, but [[James G. Birney]], father of Breckinridge's friend and Centre classmate William Birney, was an abolitionist.<ref name=davis1417 /> In an 1841 letter to Robert Breckinridge, who became his surrogate father after Cabell Breckinridge's death, John C. Breckinridge wrote that only "ignorant, foolish men" feared abolition.<ref name=klotter113 /><ref name=davis16>Davis, p. 16</ref> In an [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] address in Frankfort later that year, he decried the "unlawful dominion over the bodies&nbsp;... of men".<ref name=davis19 /> An acquaintance believed that Breckinridge's move to Iowa Territory was motivated, in part, by the fact that it was a free territory under the [[Missouri Compromise]].<ref name=davis21>Davis, p. 21</ref> 

After returning to Kentucky, Breckinridge became friends with abolitionists [[Cassius Marcellus Clay (politician)|Cassius Marcellus Clay]], [[Garrett Davis]], and [[Orville H. Browning]].<ref name=davis43>Davis, p. 43</ref> He represented [[freedmen]] in court and loaned them money.<ref name=klotter113 /> He was a [[Freemasonry|Freemason]] and member of the [[First Presbyterian Church, Lexington|First Presbyterian Church]], both of which opposed slavery.<ref name=davis43 /> Nevertheless, because blacks were educationally and socially disadvantaged in the South, Breckinridge concluded that "the interests of both races in the Commonwealth would be promoted by the continuance of their present relations".<ref>Davis, pp. 19, 44</ref> He supported the new state constitution adopted in 1850, which forbade the immigration of freedmen to Kentucky and required emancipated slaves to be expelled from the state.<ref name=davis47>Davis, p. 47</ref> Believing it was best to relocate freedmen to the African colony of [[Liberia]], he supported the Kentucky branch of the [[American Colonization Society]].<ref name=klotter113>Klotter in ''The Breckinridges of Kentucky'', p. 113</ref><ref name=davis16 /> The [[1850 United States Census|1850 Census]] showed that Breckinridge owned five slaves, aged 11 to 36.<ref name=heck31>Heck, p. 31</ref> Heck recorded that his slaves were well-treated but noted that this was not unusual and proved nothing about his views on slavery.<ref name=heck163 />

===Moderate reputation===
Because Breckinridge defended both the Union and slavery in the General Assembly, he was considered a [[moderate]] early in his political career.<ref name=senate>"John Cabell Breckinridge, 14th Vice President (1857<U+2013>1861)". United States Senate</ref> In June 1864, [[Pennsylvania]]'s [[John W. Forney]] opined that Breckinridge had been "in no sense an extremist" when elected to Congress in 1851.<ref name=senate /> Of his early encounters with Breckinridge, Forney wrote: "If he had a conscientious feeling, it was hatred of slavery, and both of us, 'Democrats' as we were, frequently confessed that it was a sinful and an anti-Democratic institution, and that the day would come when it must be peaceably or forcibly removed."<ref name=heck163 /><ref name=davis59>Davis, p. 59</ref> Heck discounts this statement, pointing out that Forney was editor of a pro-Union newspaper and Breckinridge a Confederate general at the time it was published.<ref>Heck, pp. 163&ndash;164</ref> As late as the 1856 presidential election, some alleged that Breckinridge was an abolitionist.<ref name=klotter113 /> 

By the time he began his political career, Breckinridge had concluded that slavery was more a constitutional issue than a moral one.<ref name=klotter109 /> Slaves were property, and the Constitution did not empower the federal government to interfere with property rights.<ref name=kye117>Klotter in ''The Kentucky Encyclopedia'', p. 117</ref> From Breckinridge's constructionist viewpoint, allowing Congress to legislate emancipation without constitutional sanction would lead to "unlimited dominion over the territories, excluding the people of the slave states from emigrating thither with their property".<ref name=heck33>Heck, p. 33</ref> As a private citizen, he supported the slavery protections in the [[Kentucky Constitution]] of 1850 and denounced the [[Wilmot Proviso]], which would have forbidden slavery in territory acquired in the [[Mexican<U+2013>American War]].<ref name=klotter113 /> As a state legislator, he declared slavery a "wholly local and domestic" matter, to be decided separately by the residents of each state and territory.<ref name=klotter104>Klotter in ''The Breckinridges of Kentucky'', p. 104</ref> Because [[Washington, D.C.]], was a federal entity and the federal government could not interfere with property rights, he concluded that forced emancipation there was unconstitutional.<ref name=klotter104 /> As a congressman, he insisted on Congress's "perfect non-intervention" with slavery in the territories.<ref name=eoc>Current, "John C. Breckinridge"</ref> Debating the 1854 [[Kansas<U+2013>Nebraska Act]], he explained, "The right to establish [slavery in a territory by government sanction] involves the correlative right to prohibit; and, denying both, I would vote for neither."<ref name=harrison127>Harrison, p. 127</ref>

===Later views===
Davis notes that Breckinridge's December 21, 1859, address to the state legislature marked a change in his public statements about slavery.<ref name=davis208>Davis, p. 208</ref> He decried the Republicans' desire for "negro equality", his first public indication that he may have believed blacks were biologically inferior to whites.<ref name=davis208 /> He declared that the [[Dred Scott v. Sandford|Dred Scott decision]] showed that federal courts afforded adequate protection for slave property, but advocated a federal slave code if future courts failed to enforce those protections; this marked a departure from his previous doctrine of "perfect non-interference".<ref name=davis208 /><ref name=heck80>Heck, p. 80</ref> Asserting that [[John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry]] proved Republicans intended to force abolition on the South, he predicted "resistance [to the Republican agenda] in some form is inevitable".<ref name=klotter113 /> He still urged the Assembly against secession &ndash; "God forbid that the step shall ever be taken!" &ndash; but his discussion of growing sectional conflict bothered some, including his uncle Robert.<ref name=davis209>Davis, p. 209</ref>

Klotter wrote that Breckinridge's sale of a female slave and her six-week-old child in November 1857 probably ended his days as a slaveholder.<ref name=klotter113 /> Slaves were not listed among his assets in the [[1860 United States Census|1860 Census]], but Heck noted that he had little need for slaves at that time, since he was living in Lexington's [[Phoenix Hotel (Lexington, Kentucky)|Phoenix Hotel]] after returning to Kentucky from his term as [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]].<ref name=heck167>Heck, p. 167</ref> Some slavery advocates refused to support him in the [[United States presidential election, 1860|1860 presidential race]] because he was not a slaveholder.<ref name=nhok184>Harrison and Klotter, p. 184</ref> Klotter noted that Breckinridge fared better in rural areas of the South, where there were fewer slaveholders; in urban areas where the slave population was higher, he lost to [[Constitutional Union Party (United States)|Constitutional Unionist]] candidate [[John Bell (Tennessee politician)|John Bell]], who owned 166 slaves.<ref name=klotter117>Klotter in ''The Breckinridges of Kentucky'', p. 117</ref> William C. Davis recorded that, in most of the South, the combined votes for Bell and [[Illinois]] Senator [[Stephen Douglas]] exceeded those cast for Breckinridge.<ref name=davis245>Davis, p. 245</ref> 

After losing the election to [[Abraham Lincoln]], Breckinridge worked for adoption of the [[Crittenden Compromise]] &ndash; authored by fellow Kentuckian [[John J. Crittenden]] &ndash; as a means of preserving the Union.<ref name=davis250>Davis, p. 250</ref> Breckinridge believed the Crittenden proposal &ndash; restoring the Missouri Compromise line as the separator between slave and free territory in exchange for stricter enforcement of the [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850]] and federal non-interference with slavery in the territories and Washington, D.C. &ndash; was the most extreme proposal to which the South would agree.<ref name=heck95>Heck, p. 95</ref><ref name=davis251>Davis, p. 251</ref> Ultimately, the compromise was rejected and the Civil War soon followed.<ref name=davis253>Davis, p. 253</ref>

==Early political career==
A supporter of the [[annexation of Texas]] and "[[manifest destiny]]", Breckinridge campaigned for [[James K. Polk]] in the [[United States presidential election, 1844|1844 presidential election]], prompting a relative to observe that he was "making himself very conspicuous here by making flaming loco foco speeches at the Barbecues".<ref name=davis30>Davis, p. 30</ref><ref name=heck19>Heck, p. 19</ref> He decided against running for [[Scott County, Kentucky|Scott County]] clerk after his law partner complained that he spent too much time in politics.<ref name=davis31>Davis, p. 31</ref> In 1845, he declined to seek election to the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] from the [[Kentucky's 8th congressional district|Eighth District]] but campaigned for [[Alexander Keith Marshall]], his party's unsuccessful nominee.<ref name=davis31 /><ref name=heck20>Heck, p. 20</ref> He supported [[Zachary Taylor]] for the presidency in mid-1847 but endorsed the Democratic ticket of [[Lewis Cass]] and [[William O. Butler]] after Taylor became a Whig in 1848.<ref name=heck20 />

===Kentucky House of Representatives===
[[File:John-C.-Breckinridge-circa-1850.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=A man with thick, dark hair wearing a high-collared white shirt under a black jacket and tie|Breckinridge, circa 1850]]
In October 1849, Kentucky voters called for a constitutional convention.<ref name=heck26>Heck, p. 26</ref> Emancipationists, including Breckinridge's uncles William and Robert, his brother-in-law John C. Young, and his friend Cassius Marcellus Clay, nominated "friends of emancipation" to seek election to the convention and the state legislature<ref name=heck26 /> In response, Breckinridge, who opposed "impairing [slavery protections] in any form",<ref name=heck27>Heck, p. 27</ref> was nominated by a bipartisan pro-slavery convention for one of [[Fayette County, Kentucky|Fayette County]]'s two seats in the Kentucky House of Representatives.<ref name=klotter103 /><ref name=heck27 /> With 1,481 votes, 400 more than any of his opponents, Breckinridge became the first Democrat elected to the state legislature from Fayette County, which was heavily Whig.<ref name=klotter104 /><ref name=davis45>Davis, p. 45</ref>

When the House convened in December 1849, a member from [[Mercer County, Kentucky|Mercer County]] nominated Breckinridge for Speaker against two Whigs.<ref name=davis46>Davis, p. 46</ref> After receiving 39 votes &ndash; 8 short of a majority &ndash; on the first three ballots, he withdrew, and the position went to Whig Thomas Reilly.<ref name=klotter104 /><ref name=davis46 /> Assigned to the committees on the Judiciary and Federal Relations, Breckinridge functioned as the Democratic [[floor leader]] during the session.<ref name=klotter104 /><ref name=heck29>Heck, p. 29</ref> Davis wrote that his most important work during the session was bank reform.<ref name=davis46 />

Breckinridge's first speech favored allowing the Kentucky Colonization Society to use the House chamber; later, he advocated directing Congress to establish an African freedmen colony, and  to meet the costs of transporting settlers there.<ref name="davis47" /> Funding [[internal improvements]] was traditionally a Whig stance, but Breckinridge advocated conducting a state geologic survey, making the [[Kentucky River]] more navigable, chartering a [[toll road|turnpike]], incorporating a steamboat company, and funding the [[Eastern State Hospital (Kentucky)|Kentucky Lunatic Asylum]].<ref name=davis46 /> As a reward for supporting these projects, he presided over the approval of the [[Louisville and Bowling Green Railroad]]'s charter and was appointed director of the asylum.<ref>Davis, pp. 46, 48</ref> 

Resolutions outlining Kentucky's views on the proposed [[Compromise of 1850]] were referred to the Committee on Federal Relations.<ref name=heck30>Heck, p. 30</ref> The committee's Whig majority favored one calling the compromise a "fair, equitable, and just basis" for dealing with slavery in the territories and urging Congress not to interfere with slavery there or in Washington, D.C.<ref name=heck30 /> Feeling this left open the issue of Congress's ability to legislate emancipation, Breckinridge asserted in a competing resolution that Congress could not establish or abolish slavery in states or territories.<ref name=klotter104 /><ref name=heck30 /> Both resolutions, and several passed by the [[Kentucky Senate|state Senate]], were [[Table (parliamentary procedure)|laid on the table]] without being adopted.<ref name=heck30 />

Breckinridge left the session on March 4, 1850, three days before its adjournment, to tend to John Milton Breckinridge, his infant son who had fallen ill; he died on March 18.<ref name=davis48>Davis, p. 48</ref> To distract from his grief, he campaigned for ratification of the new constitution, objecting only to its difficult amendment process.<ref>Davis, pp. 47&ndash;48</ref> He declined renomination, citing concerns "of a private and imperative nature".<ref name=davis49>Davis, p. 49</ref> Davis wrote that the problem was money, since his absence from Lexington had hurt his legal practice, but his son's death was also a factor.<ref name=davis49 />

==U.S. House of Representatives==
At an October 17, 1850, barbecue celebrating the Compromise of 1850, Breckinridge toasted its author, Whig Party founder [[Henry Clay]].<ref name=davis50>Davis, p. 50</ref> Clay reciprocated by praising Breckinridge's grandfather and father, expressing hope that Breckinridge would use his talents to serve his country, then embracing him.<ref name=heck32>Heck, p. 32</ref><ref name=davis51>Davis, p. 51</ref> Some observers believed that Clay was endorsing Breckinridge for higher office, and Whig newspapers began referring to him as "a sort of half-way Whig" and implying that he voted for Taylor in 1848.<ref name=davis51 />

===First term (1851&ndash;1853)===
Delegates to the Democrats' January 1851 state convention nominated Breckinridge to represent Kentucky's Eighth District in the U.S. House of Representatives.<ref name="heck33" /><ref name=davis52>Davis, p. 52</ref> Called the "Ashland district" because it contained Clay's [[Ashland (Henry Clay estate)|Ashland]] estate and much of the area he once represented, Whigs typically won there by 600 to 1,000 votes.<ref name="heck33" /> A Democrat had not represented it since 1828, and in the previous election no Democrat had sought the office.<ref name="heck33" /><ref name=davis53>Davis, p. 53</ref> Breckinridge's opponent, [[Leslie Combs]], was a popular [[War of 1812]] veteran and former state legislator.<ref name=harrison126>Harrison, p. 126</ref> As they campaigned together, Breckinridge's eloquence contrasted with Combs' plainspoken style.<ref name=klotter105>Klotter in ''The Breckinridges of Kentucky'', p. 105</ref><ref name=heck34>Heck, p. 34</ref> Holding that "free thought needed free trade", Breckinridge opposed Whig protective tariffs.<ref name=klotter104 /> He only favored federal funding of internal improvements "of a national character".<ref name=klotter104 /> Carrying only three of seven counties, but bolstered by a two-to-one margin in [[Owen County, Kentucky|Owen County]], Breckinridge garnered 54% of the vote, winning the election by a margin of 537.<ref name=harrison126 /><ref>Davis, pp. 55&ndash;56</ref> 

[[File:LinnBoyd.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=A man with white, wavy hair wearing a dark jacket and tie, light vest, and white shirt|Linn Boyd served as speaker during Breckinridge's tenure in the House.]]
Considered for [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]], Breckinridge believed his election unlikely and refused to run against fellow Kentuckian [[Linn Boyd]].<ref>Davis, pp. 58&ndash;59</ref> Boyd was elected, and despite Breckinridge's gesture, assigned him to the lightly-regarded [[United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs|Foreign Affairs Committee]].<ref name=klotter107>Klotter in ''The Breckinridges of Kentucky'', p. 107</ref> Breckinridge resisted ''[[The United States Magazine and Democratic Review|United States Democratic Review]]'' editor [[George Nicholas Sanders]]' efforts to recruit him to the [[Young America movement]].<ref name=davis61>Davis, p. 61</ref> Like Young Americans, Breckinridge favored westward expansion and free trade, but he disagreed with the movement's support of European revolutions and its disdain for older statesmen.<ref name=davis61 /> On March 4, 1852, Breckinridge made his first speech in the House, defending presidential aspirant William Butler against charges by [[Florida]]'s [[Edward Carrington Cabell]], a Young American and distant cousin, that Butler secretly sympathized with the [[Free Soil Party|Free Soilers]].<ref name=heck40>Heck, p. 40</ref> He denounced Sanders for his vitriolic attacks on Butler and for calling all likely Democratic presidential candidates except Stephen Douglas "old fogies".<ref>Davis, pp. 62&ndash;63</ref> 

The speech made Breckinridge a target of Whigs, Young Americans, and Douglas supporters.<ref>Davis, pp. 65&ndash;66</ref> [[Humphrey Marshall (general)|Humphrey Marshall]], a Kentucky Whig who supported incumbent President [[Millard Fillmore]], attacked Breckinridge for claiming Fillmore had not fully disclosed his views on slavery.<ref name=davis66>Davis, p. 66</ref> Illinois' [[William Alexander Richardson]], a Douglas backer, tried to distance Douglas from Sanders' attacks on Butler, but Breckinridge showed that Douglas endorsed the ''Democratic Review'' a month after it printed its first anti-Butler article.<ref>Davis, pp. 66&ndash;67</ref> Finally, Breckinridge's cousin, [[California]]'s [[Edward C. Marshall]], charged that Butler would name Breckinridge Attorney General in exchange for his support and revived the charge that Breckinridge broke party ranks, supporting Zachary Taylor for president.<ref name=davis67>Davis, p. 67</ref> Breckinridge ably defended himself, but Sanders continued to attack him and Butler, claiming Butler would name Breckinridge as his running mate, even though Breckinridge was [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution|too young to qualify as vice president]].<ref name=davis68>Davis, p. 68</ref>

After his maiden speech, Breckinridge took a more active role in the House.<ref name=davis68 /> In debate with [[Ohio]]'s [[Joshua Reed Giddings]], he defended the Fugitive Slave Law's constitutionality and criticized Giddings for hindering the return of [[fugitive slave]]s.<ref name=davis68 /><ref name=heck39>Heck, p. 39</ref> He opposed [[Tennessee]] Congressman [[Andrew Johnson]]'s [[Homestead Act|Homestead Bill]], fearing it would create more territories that excluded slavery.<ref name=davis68 /> Although generally opposed to funding local improvements, he supported the repair of two [[Potomac River]] bridges to avoid higher costs later.<ref name="heck39" /> Other minor stands included supporting measures to benefit his district's [[hemp]] farmers, voting against giving the president ten more appointments to the [[United States Naval Academy|U.S. Naval Academy]], and opposing funds for a sculpture of [[George Washington]] because the sculptor proposed depicting Washington in a [[toga]].<ref name=klotter107 /><ref name="heck39" />

Beginning in April, Breckinridge made daily visits to an ailing Henry Clay.<ref name=davis69>Davis, p. 69</ref> Clay died June 29, 1852, and Breckinridge garnered nationwide praise and enhanced popularity in Kentucky after eulogizing Clay in the House.<ref name=klotter107 /><ref name=davis70>Davis, p. 70</ref> Days later, he spoke in opposition to increasing a subsidy to the [[Collins Line]] for carrying trans-[[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] mail, noting that Collins profited by carrying passengers and cargo on mail ships.<ref name=davis71>Davis, p. 71</ref> In wartime, the government could commandeer and retrofit Collins's steamboats as warships, but Breckinridge cited [[Commodore (United States)|Commodore]] [[Matthew C.

===Second term (1853&ndash;1855)===
With Butler's chances for the presidential nomination waning, Breckinridge convinced the Kentucky delegation to the [[1852 Democratic National Convention]] not to nominate Butler until later balloting when he might become a compromise candidate.<ref name=davis72 /> He urged restraint when Lewis Cass's support dropped sharply on the twentieth ballot, but Kentucky's delegates would wait no longer; on the next ballot, they nominated Butler, but he failed to gain support.<ref name=davis72 /> After [[Franklin Pierce]], Breckinridge's second choice, was nominated, Breckinridge tried, unsuccessfully, to recruit Douglas to Pierce's cause.<ref name=davis73>Davis, p. 73</ref> Pierce lost by 3,200 votes in Kentucky &ndash; one of four states won by [[Winfield Scott]] &ndash; but  was elected to the presidency, and appointed Breckinridge governor of [[Washington Territory]] in recognition of his efforts.<ref name=davis73 /><ref>Heck, pp. 37&ndash;38</ref> Unsure of his re-election chances in Kentucky, Breckinridge had sought the appointment, but after John J. Crittenden, rumored to be his challenger, was elected to the Senate in 1853, he decided to decline it and run for re-election.<ref name=davis76>Davis, p. 76</ref>

====Election====
[[File:RPLetcher.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=A short, balding man in a black suit|Former Governor Robert P. Letcher, Breckinridge's opponent in 1853]]
The Whigs chose Attorney General [[James Harlan (congressman)|James Harlan]] to oppose Breckinridge, but he withdrew in March when some party factions opposed him.<ref>Davis, pp. 76&ndash;77</ref> [[Robert P. Letcher]], a former governor who had not lost in 14 elections, was the Whigs' second choice.<ref name=davis77>Davis, p. 77</ref> Letcher was an able campaigner who combined oratory and anecdotes to entertain and energize an audience.<ref name=klotter105 /> Breckinridge focused on issues in their first debate, comparing the Whig [[Tariff of 1842]] to the Democrats' lower [[Walker tariff]], which increased trade and yielded more tax revenue.<ref name=davis81>Davis, p. 81</ref> Instead of answering Breckinridge's points, Letcher appealed to party loyalty, claiming Breckinridge would misrepresent the district "because he is a Democrat".<ref name=davis82>Davis, p. 82</ref> Letcher appealed to Whigs "to protect the grave of Mr. [Henry] Clay from the impious tread of Democracy",<ref group="note">"Democracy" here refers to the U.S. Democratic Party, not the [[democracy|form of government]].</ref> but Breckinridge pointed to his friendly relations with Clay, remarking that Clay's [[Will (law)|will]] did not mandate that "his ashes be exhumed" and "thrown into the scale to influence the result of the present Congressional contest".<ref name="davis82" /> 

Cassius Clay, Letcher's political enemy, backed Breckinridge despite their differences on slavery.<ref name=heck34 /> Citing Clay's support and the abolitionism of Breckinridge's uncle Robert, Letcher charged that Breckinridge was an abolitionist.<ref name=klotter106>Klotter in ''The Breckinridges of Kentucky'', p. 106</ref> In answer, Breckinridge quoted newspaper accounts and sworn testimony, provided by [[John L. Robinson]], of a speech Letcher made in [[Indiana]] for Zachary Taylor in 1848.<ref name=davis80>Davis, p. 80</ref> In the speech, made alongside [[Thomas Metcalfe (Kentucky)|Thomas Metcalfe]], another former Whig governor of Kentucky, Letcher predicted that the Kentucky Constitution then being drafted would provide for gradual emancipation, declaring, "It is only the ultra men in the extreme South who desire the extension of slavery."<ref name=davis80 />

When Letcher confessed doubts about his election chances, Whigs began fundraising outside the district, using the money to buy votes or pay Breckinridge supporters not to vote.<ref name=davis91>Davis, p. 91</ref> Breckinridge estimated that the donations, which came from as far away as [[New York]] and included contributions from the Collins Line, totaled $30,000; Whig George Robertson believed it closer to $100,000.<ref name=heck34 /><ref name=davis90>Davis, p. 90</ref> Washington, D.C., banker [[William Wilson Corcoran]] contributed $1,000 to Breckinridge, who raised a few thousand dollars.<ref name=davis91 /> Out of 12,538 votes cast, Breckinridge won by 526.<ref name=heck35>Heck, p. 35</ref> He received 71% of the vote in Owen County, which recorded 123 more votes than registered voters.<ref name=heck35 /> Grateful for the county's support, he nicknamed his son, John Witherspoon Breckinridge, "Owen".<ref name=klotter106 />

====Service====
Of 234 representatives in the House, Breckinridge was one of 80 re-elected to the [[Thirty-third Congress]].<ref name=heck37>Heck, p. 37</ref> His relative seniority, and Pierce's election, increased his influence.<ref name=heck37 /> He was rumored to have Pierce's backing for Speaker of the House, but he again deferred to Boyd; [[Maryland]]'s [[Augustus R. Sollers]] spoiled Boyd's unanimous election by voting for Breckinridge.<ref>Davis, pp. 98&ndash;99</ref> Still not given a committee chairmanship, he was assigned to the [[United States House Committee on Ways and Means|Ways and Means Committee]], where he secured passage of a bill to cover overspending in fiscal year 1853&ndash;1854; it was the only time in his career that he solely managed a bill.<ref name=davis121>Davis, p. 121</ref> His attempts to increase Kentucky's allocation in a rivers and harbors bill were unsuccessful but popular with his Whig constituents.<ref name=klotter107 />

[[File:Missouri Compromise Line.svg|thumb|left|The Missouri Compromise Line, repealed by the Kansas<U+2013>Nebraska Act]]
In January 1854, Douglas introduced the Kansas<U+2013>Nebraska Act to organize the [[Nebraska Territory]].<ref name=davis100>Davis, p. 100</ref> Southerners had thwarted his previous attempts to organize the territory because Nebraska lay north of [[parallel 36<U+00B0>30' north]], the line separating slave and free territory under the Missouri Compromise.<ref name=davis101>Davis, p. 101</ref> They feared that the territory would be organized into new free states that would vote against the South on slavery issues.<ref name=davis101 /> The Kansas<U+2013>Nebraska Act allowed the territory's settlers to decide whether or not to permit slavery, an implicit repeal of the Missouri Compromise.<ref name=davis101 /> Kentucky Senator [[Archibald Dixon]]'s amendment to make the repeal explicit angered northern Democrats, but Breckinridge believed it would move the slavery issue from national to local politics, and he urged Pierce to support it.<ref>Davis, pp. 104&ndash;105</ref><ref>Heck, pp. 42, 55</ref> Breckinridge wrote to his uncle Robert that he "had more to do than any man here, in putting [the Act] in its present shape",<ref name="heck39" /> but Heck notes that few extant records support this claim.<ref name="heck39" /> The repeal amendment made the act more palatable to the South; only 9 of 58 Southern congressmen voted against it.<ref name=davis119>Davis, p. 119</ref> No Northern Whigs voted for the measure, but 44 of 86 Northern Democrats voted in the affirmative, enough to pass it.<ref name=davis119 /> The Senate quickly concurred, and Pierce signed the act into law on May 30, 1854.<ref name=davis119 />

During the debate on the bill, New York's [[Francis B. Cutting]] demanded that Breckinridge retract or explain a statement he had made, which Breckinridge understood as a challenge to [[duel]].<ref name=harrison126 /> Under the ''[[code duello]]'', the challenged party selected the weapons and the distance between combatants; Breckinridge chose rifles at 60 paces and suggested the duel be held in [[Silver Spring, Maryland]], on his friend, [[Francis Preston Blair]]'s estate.<ref name=harrison126 /><ref name=heck45>Heck, p. 45</ref> Cutting had not meant his remark as a challenge, but insisted that he was now challenged and selected pistols at 10 paces.<ref name=harrison126 /> While their representatives tried to clarify matters, Breckinridge and Cutting made amends, averting the duel.<ref name=harrison126 /> Had it taken place, Breckinridge could have been removed from the House; the 1850 Kentucky Constitution prevented duelists from holding office.<ref name=heck45 />

In the second session of the 33rd Congress, Breckinridge acted as spokesman for Ways and Means Committee bills, including a bill to assume and pay the debts Texas incurred prior to its annexation.<ref name=davis128>Davis, p. 128</ref> Breckinridge's friends, W. W. Corcoran and [[Jesse D. Bright]], were two of Texas's major creditors.<ref name=davis128 /> The bill, which was approved, paid only those debts related to powers Texas surrendered to Congress upon annexation.<ref name=davis129>Davis, p. 129</ref> Breckinridge was disappointed that the House defeated a measure to pay the [[Sioux]] $12,000 owed them for the 1839 purchase of an island in the [[Mississippi River]]; the debt was never paid.<ref name=davis129 /> Another increase in the subsidy to the Collins Line passed over his opposition, but Pierce [[veto]]ed it.<ref name=davis129 />

===Retirement from the House===
In February 1854, the General Assembly's Whig majority [[gerrymander]]ed the Eighth District, removing over 500 Democratic voters and replacing them with several hundred Whig voters by removing Owen and [[Jessamine County, Kentucky|Jessamine]] counties from the district and adding [[Harrison County, Kentucky|Harrison]] and [[Nicholas County, Kentucky|Nicholas]] counties to it.<ref name=davis124>Davis, p. 124</ref> The cooperation of the [[Know Nothing Party]] &ndash; a relatively new [[Nativism (politics)|nativist]] political entity &ndash; with the faltering Whigs further hindered Breckinridge's re-election chances.<ref name=davis124 /> With his family again in financial straits, his wife wanted him to retire from national politics.<ref name=davis124 />

[[Pierre Soul<U+00E9>]], the [[United States Ambassador to Spain|U.S. Minister to Spain]], resigned in December 1854 after being unable to negotiate the annexation of [[Cuba]] and angering the Spanish by drafting the [[Ostend Manifesto]], which called for the U.S. to take Cuba by force.<ref name=davis126>Davis, p. 126</ref> Pierce nominated Breckinridge to fill the vacancy, but did not tell him until just before the Senate's January 16 [[advice and consent|confirmation]] vote.<ref name=davis127>Davis, p. 127</ref> After consulting [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[William L. Marcy]], Breckinridge concluded that the salary was insufficient and Soul<U+00E9> had so damaged Spanish relations that he would be unable to accomplish anything significant.<ref>Davis, pp. 127&ndash;128</ref> In a February 8, 1855, letter to Pierce, he cited reasons "of a private and domestic nature" for declining the nomination.<ref name=heck48>Heck, p. 48</ref> On March 17, 1855, he announced he would retire from the House.<ref name=heck48 />

Breckinridge and [[Minnesota Territory]]'s [[Henry Mower Rice]] were among the speculators who invested in land near present-day [[Superior, Wisconsin]].<ref name=heck50>Heck, p. 50</ref> Rice disliked [[Governor of Minnesota|Minnesota's territorial governor]], [[Willis A. Gorman]], and petitioned Pierce to replace him with Breckinridge.<ref>Heck, pp. 50&ndash;51</ref> Pierce twice investigated Gorman, but found no grounds to remove him from office.<ref name=heck51>Heck, p. 51</ref> Breckinridge fell ill when traveling to view his investments in mid-1855 and was unable to campaign in the state elections.<ref name=heck53>Heck, p. 53</ref> Know Nothings captured every state office and six congressional districts &ndash; including the Eighth District &ndash; and Breckinridge sent regrets to friends in Washington, D.C., promising to take a more active role in the 1856 campaigns.<ref>Heck, pp. 53&ndash;54</ref>

==U.S. vice president==
Two Kentuckians &ndash; Breckinridge's friend, [[Governor of Kentucky|Governor]] [[Lazarus W. Powell]] and his enemy, Linn Boyd &ndash; were potential Democratic presidential nominees in 1856.<ref name=davis137>Davis, p. 137</ref> Breckinridge &ndash; a delegate to the [[1856 Democratic National Convention|national convention]] and designated as a [[United States Electoral College|presidential elector]] &ndash; favored Pierce's re-election but convinced the state Democratic convention to leave the delegates free to support any candidate the party coalesced behind.<ref name=davis138>Davis, p. 138</ref> To a New Yorker who proposed that Breckinridge's nomination could unite the party, he replied "Humbug".<ref name=davis139>Davis, p. 139</ref>

===Election===
[[File:1856DemocraticPoster.png|thumb|right|upright|alt=A campaign poster for Buchanan and Breckinridge|A campaign poster for Buchanan and Breckinridge]]
Pierce was unable to secure the nomination at the national convention, so Breckinridge switched his support to Stephen Douglas, but the combination of Pierce and Douglas supporters did not prevent [[James Buchanan]]'s nomination.<ref name=klotter110>Klotter in ''The Breckinridges of Kentucky'', p. 110</ref> After Douglas's floor manager, William Richardson, suggested that nominating Breckinridge for vice president would help Buchanan secure the support of erstwhile Douglas backers in the [[United States presidential election, 1856|general election]], [[Louisiana]]'s J. L. Lewis nominated him.<ref name=davis144>Davis, p. 144</ref> Breckinridge declined in deference to Linn Boyd but received 51 votes on the first ballot, behind [[Mississippi]]'s [[John A. Quitman]] with 59, but ahead of third-place Boyd, who garnered 33.<ref name=davis145>Davis, p. 145</ref> On the second ballot, Breckinridge received overwhelming support, and opposition delegates changed their votes to make his nomination unanimous.<ref name=heck59>Heck, p. 59</ref> 

The election was between Buchanan and Republican [[John C. Fr<U+00E9>mont]] in the north and between Buchanan and Millard Fillmore, nominated by a pro-slavery faction of the Know Nothings, in the South.<ref name=heck60>Heck, p. 60</ref> [[Governor of Tennessee|Tennessee Governor]] Andrew Johnson and ''[[Congressional Globe]]'' editor John C. Rives promoted the possibility that Douglas and Pierce supporters would back Fillmore in the Southern states, denying Buchanan a majority in the Electoral College and throwing the election to the House of Representatives.<ref name=davis158>Davis, p. 158</ref> There, Buchanan's opponents would prevent a vote, and the Senate's choice for vice president &ndash; certain to be Breckinridge &ndash; would become president.<ref name=davis158 /> There is no evidence that Breckinridge countenanced this scheme.<ref name=davis159>Davis, p. 159</ref> Defying contemporary political convention, Breckinridge spoke frequently during the campaign, stressing Democratic fidelity to the constitution and charging that the Republican emancipationist agenda would tear the country apart.<ref name=klotter111>Klotter in ''The Breckinridges of Kentucky'', p. 111</ref> His appearances in the critical state of Pennsylvania helped allay Buchanan's fears that Breckinridge desired to throw the election to the House.<ref name=davis159 /> "Buck and Breck" won the election with 174 electoral votes to Fr<U+00E9>mont's 114 and Fillmore's 8, and Democrats carried Kentucky for the first time since [[United States presidential election, 1828|1828]].<ref name=harrison127 /><ref name=heck63>Heck, p. 63</ref> Thirty-six at the time of his inauguration on March 4, 1857, Breckinridge remains the youngest vice president in U.S. history.<ref name=klotter112>Klotter in ''The Breckinridges of Kentucky'', p. 112</ref>

When Breckinridge asked to meet with Buchanan shortly after the inauguration, Buchanan told him to come to the [[White House]] and ask to see the hostess, [[Harriet Lane]].<ref name=heck67>Heck, p. 67</ref><ref group=note>The role of White House hostess was typically filled by the [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] (the president's wife), but Buchanan was unmarried. His niece, Harriet Lane, functioned as the mansion's official hostess during his term.</ref> Offended, Breckinridge refused to do so; Buchanan's friends later explained that asking to see Lane was a secret instruction to take a guest to the president.<ref name=heck67 /> Buchanan apologized for the misunderstanding, but the event portended a poor relationship between the two men.<ref name=heck68>Heck, p. 68</ref><ref name=davis171>Davis, p. 171</ref> Resentful of Breckinridge's support for both Pierce and Douglas, Buchanan allowed him little influence in the administration.<ref name=klotter112 /> Breckinridge's recommendation that former Whigs and Kentuckians &ndash; Powell, in particular &ndash; be included in Buchanan's cabinet went unheeded.<ref name=davis168>Davis, p. 168</ref> Kentuckians [[James Brown Clay|James B. Clay]] and Cassius M. Clay were offered diplomatic missions to [[Berlin]] and [[Peru]], respectively, but both declined.<ref>Davis, pp. 169&ndash;170</ref> Buchanan often asked Breckinridge to receive and entertain foreign dignitaries, but in 1858, Breckinridge declined Buchanan's request that he resign and take the again-vacant position as U.S. Minister to Spain.<ref>Davis, pp. 181, 192</ref> The only private meeting between the two occurred near the end of Buchanan's term, when the president summoned Breckinridge to get his advice on whether to issue a [[Presidential Proclamation|proclamation]] declaring a day of "Humiliation and Prayer" over the divided state of the nation; Breckinridge affirmed that Buchanan should make the proclamation.<ref>Davis, pp. 250&ndash;251</ref>

As vice president, Breckinridge was tasked with presiding over the debates of the Senate. In an early address to that body, he promised, "It shall be my constant aim, gentlemen of the Senate, to exhibit at all times, to every member of this body, the courtesy and impartiality which are due to the representatives of equal States."<ref name=davis167>Davis, p. 167</ref> Historian [[Lowell H. Harrison]] wrote that, while Breckinridge fulfilled his promise to the satisfaction of most, acting as moderator limited his participation in debate.<ref name=harrison127 /> Five tie-breaking votes provided a means of expressing his views. Economic motivations explained two &ndash; forcing an immediate vote on a codfishing tariff and limiting military pensions to $50 per month (${{Inflation|US|50|1858|r=2}} in present-day currency).<ref name=davis184>Davis, p. 184</ref> A third cleared the floor for a vote on Douglas's motion to admit [[Oregon]] to the Union, and a fourth defeated Johnson's Homestead Bill.<ref>Davis, pp. 184, 195</ref> The final vote effected a wording change in a resolution forbidding constitutional amendments that empowered Congress to interfere with property rights.<ref name=davis259>Davis, p. 259</ref> The Senate's move from the [[Old Senate Chamber]] to a more spacious one on January 4, 1859, provided another opportunity.<ref name=harrison127 /> Afforded the chance to make the last address in the old chamber, Breckinridge encouraged compromise and unity among the states to resolve sectional conflicts.<ref name=harrison127 /> 

Despite irregularities in the approval of the [[Lecompton Constitution]] by [[Kansas]] voters, Breckinridge agreed with Buchanan that it was legitimate, but he kept his position secret, and some believed he agreed with his friend, Stephen Douglas, that Lecompton was invalid.<ref>Davis, pp. 178, 182</ref> Breckinridge's absence from the Senate during debate on admitting Kansas to the Union under Lecompton seemed to confirm this, but his leave &ndash; to take his wife from [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana]], where she was recovering from an illness, to Washington, D.C. &ndash; had been planned for months.<ref>Davis, pp. 182&ndash;184</ref> The death of his grandmother, Polly Breckinridge, prompted him to leave earlier than planned.<ref name=davis182>Davis, p. 182</ref> During his absence, both houses of Congress voted to re-submit the Lecompton Constitution to Kansas voters for approval.<ref name=davis183>Davis, p. 183</ref> On resubmission, it was overwhelmingly rejected.<ref name=davis190>Davis, p. 190</ref>

By January 1859, friends knew Breckinridge desired the U.S. Senate seat of John J. Crittenden, whose term expired on March 3, 1861.<ref name=harrison127 /><ref name=heck77>Heck, p. 77</ref> The General Assembly would elect Crittenden's successor in December 1859, so Breckinridge's election would not affect any presidential aspirations he might harbor.<ref name=heck77 /> Democrats chose Breckinridge's friend [[Beriah Magoffin]] over Linn Boyd as their gubernatorial nominee, bolstering Breckinridge's chances for the senatorship, the presidency, or both.<ref name=heck78>Heck, p. 78</ref> Boyd was expected to be Breckinridge's chief opponent for the Senate, but he withdrew on November 28, citing ill health, and died three weeks later.<ref name=heck79>Heck, p. 79</ref> The Democratic majority in the General Assembly elected Breckinridge to succeed Crittenden by a vote of 81 to 53 over [[Joshua Fry Bell]], who Magoffin had defeated for the governorship in August.<ref name=heck79 />

After [[Minnesota]]'s admission to the Union in May 1858, opponents accused Breckinridge of rigging a random draw so that his friend, Henry Rice, would get the longer of the state's two Senate terms.<ref name=davis185>Davis, p. 185</ref> [[Secretary of the United States Senate|Senate Secretary]] [[Asbury Dickins]] blunted the charges, averring that he alone handled the instruments used in the drawing.<ref name=davis185 /> Republican Senator [[Solomon Foot]] closed a special session of the [[Thirty-sixth Congress]] in March 1859 by offering a resolution praising Breckinridge for his impartiality; after the session, the Republican-leaning ''[[New York Times]]'' noted that while the star of the Buchanan administration "falls lower every hour in prestige and political consequence, the star of the Vice President rises higher".<ref name=davis197>Davis, p. 197</ref>

==Presidential election of 1860==
{{main|United States presidential election, 1860}}
Breckinridge's lukewarm support for Douglas in his [[United States Senate elections, 1858|1858 senatorial re-election bid]] against Abraham Lincoln convinced Douglas that Breckinridge would seek the Democratic presidential nomination, but in a January 1860 letter to his uncle, Breckinridge averred he was "firmly resolved not to".<ref name=klotter114>Klotter in ''The Breckinridges of Kentucky'', p. 114</ref> Douglas's political enemies supported Breckinridge, and Buchanan reluctantly dispensed patronage to Breckinridge allies, further alienating Douglas.<ref name=klotter114 /> After Breckinridge left open the possibility of supporting a federal slave code in 1859, Douglas wrote to [[Robert Toombs]] that he would support his enemy and fellow Georgian [[Alexander H. Stephens]] for the nomination over Breckinridge, although he would vote for Breckinridge over any Republican in the general election.<ref>Davis, pp. 212&ndash;213</ref>

Breckinridge asked James Clay to protect his interests at the [[1860 Democratic National Convention]] in [[Charleston, South Carolina]].<ref name=heck82>Heck, p. 82</ref> Clay, Lazarus Powell, [[William Preston (Kentucky)|William Preston]], [[Henry Cornelius Burnett]], and [[James B. Beck]] desired to nominate Breckinridge for president, but in a compromise with Kentucky's Douglas backers, the delegation went to Charleston committed to former [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Treasury Secretary]] [[James Guthrie (Kentucky)|James Guthrie]] of Louisville.<ref name=klotter114 /><ref name=heck82 /> Fifty [[Southern Democrats]], upset at the convention's refusal to include slavery protection in the party's platform, walked out of the convention; the remaining delegates decided that nominations required a [[two-thirds majority]] of the original 303 delegates.<ref name=davis218>Davis, p. 218</ref><ref name=nhok183>Harrison and Klotter, p. 183</ref> For 35 ballots, Douglas ran well ahead of Guthrie but short of the needed majority.<ref name=klotter114 /> [[Arkansas]]'s lone remaining delegate nominated Breckinridge, but Beck asked that the nomination be withdrawn because Breckinridge refused to compete with Guthrie.<ref name=davis218 /> Twenty-one more ballots were cast, but the convention remained deadlocked.<ref name=klotter114 /> On May 3, the convention adjourned until June 18 in [[Baltimore, Maryland]].<ref name=heck83>Heck, p. 83</ref> 

Breckinridge's communication with his supporters between the meetings indicated greater willingness to become a candidate, but he instructed Clay to nominate him only if his support exceeded Guthrie's.<ref name=klotter115>Klotter in ''The Breckinridges of Kentucky'', p. 115</ref> Many believed that Buchanan supported Breckinridge, but Breckinridge wrote to Beck that "The President is not for me except as a last necessity, that is to say not until his help will not be worth a damn."<ref name=klotter115 /><ref name=davis212>Davis, p. 212</ref> After a majority of the delegates, most of them Douglas supporters, voted to replace [[Alabama]] and Louisiana's walk-out delegates with new, pro-Douglas men in Baltimore, Virginia's delegation led another walk-out of Southern Democrats and Buchanan-controlled delegates from the northeast and Pacific coast; 105 delegates, including 10 of Kentucky's 24, left, and the remainder nominated Douglas.<ref name=heck84>Heck, p. 84</ref> The walk-outs held a rival nominating convention, styled the National Democratic Convention, at the Maryland Institute in Baltimore.<ref name=melzer218>Melzer, p. 218</ref> At that convention on June 23, [[Massachusetts]]' [[George B. Loring]] nominated Breckinridge for president, and he received 81 of the 105 votes cast, the remainder going to [[Daniel S. Dickinson]] of New York.<ref name=heck84 /> Oregon's [[Joseph Lane]] was nominated for vice-president.<ref name=ewb /> 

Breckinridge told Beck he would not accept the nomination because it would split the Democrats and ensure the election of Republican Abraham Lincoln.<ref name=davis224>Davis, p. 224</ref> On June 25, Mississippi Senator [[Jefferson Davis]] proposed that Breckinridge should accept the nomination; his strength in the South would convince Douglas that his own candidacy was futile.<ref name=davis225>Davis, p. 225</ref> Breckinridge, Douglas, and Constitutional Unionist John Bell would withdraw, and Democrats could nominate a compromise candidate.<ref name=davis225 /> Breckinridge accepted the nomination, but maintained that he had not sought it and that he had been nominated "against my expressed wishes".<ref name=klotter115 /><ref name=heck85>Heck, p. 85</ref> Davis's compromise plan failed when Douglas refused to withdraw, believing his supporters would vote for Lincoln rather than a compromise candidate.<ref name=heck86>Heck, p. 86</ref>

===Election===
The election effectively pitted Lincoln against Douglas in the North and Breckinridge against Bell in the South.<ref name=harrison128>Harrison, p. 128</ref> Far from expectant of victory, Breckinridge told Davis's wife, [[Varina Davis|Varina]], "I trust I have the courage to lead a forlorn hope."<ref name=ewb /><ref name=nhok183 /> [[Caleb Cushing]] oversaw the publication of several Breckinridge campaign documents, including a campaign biography and copies of his speeches on the occasion of the Senate's move to a new chamber and his election to the Senate.<ref name=davis233>Davis, p. 233</ref> After making a few short speeches during stops between Washington, D.C. and Lexington, Breckinridge stated that, consistent with contemporary custom, he would make no more speeches until after the election, but the results of an August 1860 special election to replace the deceased clerk of the [[Kentucky Court of Appeals]] convinced him that his candidacy could be faltering.<ref name=heck86 /> He had expressed confidence that the Democratic candidate for the clerkship would win, and "nothing short of a defeat by 6,000 or 8,000 would alarm me for November".  Constitutional Unionist Leslie Combs won by 23,000 votes, prompting Breckinridge to make a full-length campaign speech in Lexington on September 5, 1860.<ref name=heck87>Heck, p. 87</ref>

Breckinridge's three-hour speech was primarily defensive; his moderate tone was designed to win votes in the north but risked losing Southern support to Bell.<ref name=heck87 /><ref name=kye118>Klotter in ''The Kentucky Encyclopedia'', p. 118</ref> He denied charges that he had supported Zachary Taylor over Lewis Cass in 1848, that he had sided with abolitionists in 1849, and that he had sought John Brown's [[clemency|pardon]] for the Harpers Ferry raid.<ref name=heck87 /> Reminding the audience that Douglas wanted the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] to decide the issue of slavery in the territories, he pointed out that Douglas then denounced the ''Dred Scott'' ruling and laid out a means for territorial legislatures to circumvent it.<ref name=heck88>Heck, p. 88</ref> Breckinridge supported the legitimacy of [[secession]] but insisted it was not the solution to the country's sectional disagreements.<ref name=eoc /> In answer to Douglas's charge that there was not "a disunionist in America who is not a Breckinridge man", he challenged the assembled crowd "to point out an act, to disclose an utterance, to reveal a thought of mine hostile to the constitution and union of the States".<ref name=nhok184 /> He warned that Lincoln's insistence on emancipation made him the real disunionist.<ref name=nhok184 /><ref name=heck89>Heck, p. 89</ref>

Breckinridge finished third in the popular vote with 849,781 votes to Lincoln's 1,866,452, Douglas's 1,379,957, and Bell's 588,879.<ref name=davis245 /> He carried 12 of the 15 Southern states and the [[Border states (American Civil War)|border states]] of Maryland, [[Delaware]] and [[North Carolina]] but lost his home state to Bell.<ref name=davis245 /> His greatest support in the [[Deep South]] came from areas that opposed secession.<ref>Klotter in ''The Breckinridges of Kentucky'', pp. 117&ndash;118</ref> Davis pointed out that only Breckinridge garnered nearly equal support from the Deep South, the border states, and the free states of the North.<ref name=davis246>Davis, p. 246</ref> His 72 electoral votes bested Bell's 59 and Douglas's 12, but Lincoln received 180, enough to win the election.<ref name=kye118 />

===Aftermath===
Three weeks after the election, Breckinridge returned to Washington, D.C., to preside over the Senate's [[lame duck session]].<ref name=heck92>Heck, p. 92</ref> Lazarus Powell, now a senator, proposed a resolution creating a [[United States Senate Select Committee of Thirteen on the Disturbed Condition of the Country|committee of thirteen members]] to respond to the portion of Buchanan's address regarding the disturbed condition of the country.<ref name=heck94>Heck, p. 94</ref> Breckinridge appointed the members of the committee which, in Heck's opinion, formed "an able committee, representing every major faction".<ref name=heck94 /> John J. Crittenden proposed a compromise by which slavery would be forbidden in territories north of parallel 36<U+00B0>30<U+2032> north &ndash; the demarcation line used in the Missouri Compromise &ndash; and permitted south of it, but the committee's five Republicans rejected the proposal.<ref name=heck95 /> On December 31, the committee reported that it could come to no agreement.<ref name=heck95 /> Writing to Magoffin on January 6, Breckinridge complained that the Republicans were "rejecting everything, proposing nothing" and "pursuing a policy which&nbsp;... threatens to plunge the country into&nbsp;... civil war".<ref name=heck95 />

One of Breckinridge's final acts as vice-president was announcing the vote of the Electoral College to a joint session of Congress on February 13, 1861.<ref name=nhok185>Harrison and Klotter, p. 185</ref> Rumors abounded that he would tamper with the vote to prevent Lincoln's election.<ref name=davis257>Davis, p. 257</ref> Knowing that some legislators planned to attend the session armed, Breckinridge asked Winfield Scott to post guards in and around the chambers.<ref name=davis257 /> One legislator raised a [[point of order]], requesting that the guards be ejected, but Breckinridge refused to sustain it; the electoral vote proceeded, and Breckinridge announced Lincoln's election as president.<ref name=davis258>Davis, p. 258</ref> After Lincoln's arrival in Washington, D.C., on February 24, Breckinridge visited him at the [[Willard InterContinental Washington|Willard Hotel]].<ref name=heck97>Heck, p. 97</ref> After making a valedictory address on March 4, he swore in [[Hannibal Hamlin]] as his successor as vice president; Hamlin then swore in Breckinridge and the other incoming senators.<ref name=klotter118>Klotter in ''The Breckinridges of Kentucky'', p. 118</ref>

==U.S. Senate==
Because Republicans controlled neither house of Congress, nor the Supreme Court, Breckinridge did not believe Lincoln's election was a mandate for secession.<ref name=harrison129>Harrison, p. 129</ref> Ignoring [[James Murray Mason]]'s contention that no Southerner should serve in Lincoln's cabinet, Breckinridge supported the appointment of Virginian [[Montgomery Blair]] as [[United States Postmaster General|Postmaster General]].<ref name=davis261 /> He also voted against a resolution to remove the names of the senators from seceded states from the Senate roll.<ref name=davis262>Davis, p. 262</ref><ref group=note>For a list of individuals expelled from the U.S. Senate, see [[List of United States senators expelled or censured]]. For a list of seceded states and their dates of secession, see [[Confederate States of America#States]].</ref>

[[File:John C Breckinridge-04775-restored.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=A man with dark, receding hair wearing a white shirt and black jacket and tie|Breckinridge as a senator]]
Working for a compromise that might yet save the Union, Breckinridge opposed a proposal by Ohio's [[Clement Vallandigham]] that the border states unite to form a "middle confederacy" that would place a buffer between the U.S. and the seceded states, nor did Breckinridge desire to see Kentucky as the southernmost state in a northern confederacy; its position south of the [[Ohio River]] left it too vulnerable to the southern confederacy should war occur.<ref name=davis261>Davis, p. 261</ref> Urging that federal troops be withdrawn from the seceded states, he insisted "their presence can accomplish no good, but will certainly produce incalculable mischief".<ref name=heck98>Heck, p. 98</ref> He warned that, unless Republicans made some concessions, Kentucky and the other border states would also secede.<ref name=heck98 />

When the legislative session ended on March 28, Breckinridge returned to Kentucky and addressed the state legislature on April 2, 1861.<ref name=heck98 /> He urged the General Assembly to push for federal adoption of the Crittenden Compromise and advocated calling a border states convention which would draft a compromise proposal and submit it to the Northern and Southern states for adoption.<ref name=nhok187>Harrison and Klotter, p. 187</ref> Asserting that the states were coequal and free to choose their own course, he maintained that, if the border states convention failed, Kentucky should call a sovereignty convention and join the Confederacy as a last resort.<ref name=harrison129 /><ref name=nhok187 /><ref name=davis264>Davis, p. 264</ref>

The [[Battle of Fort Sumter]], which began the Civil War, occurred days later, before the border states convention could be held.<ref name=nhok187 /> Magoffin called a special legislative session on May 6, and the legislature authorized creation of a six-man commission to decide the state's course in the war.<ref name=nhok188>Harrison and Klotter, p. 188</ref> Breckinridge, Magoffin, and [[Richard Hawes]] were the states' rights delegates to the conference, while Crittenden, Archibald Dixon, and Samuel S. Nicholas represented the Unionist position.<ref name=nhok188 /> The delegates were only able to agree on a policy of armed neutrality, which Breckinridge believed impractical and ultimately untenable, but preferable to more drastic actions.<ref name=nhok188 /> In special elections held June 20, 1861, Unionists won 9 of Kentucky's 10 House seats, and in the August 5 state elections, Unionists gained majorities in both houses of the state legislature.<ref name=harrison129 />

When the Senate convened for a special session on July 4, 1861, Breckinridge stood almost alone in opposition to the war.<ref name=harrison130>Harrison, p. 130</ref> Labeled a traitor, he was removed from the [[United States Senate Committee on Armed Services|Committee on Military Affairs]].<ref name=klotter120>Klotter in ''The Breckinridges of Kentucky'', p. 120</ref><ref name=davis268>Davis, p. 268</ref> He demanded to know what authority Lincoln had to blockade Southern ports or suspend the writ of ''[[habeas corpus]]''.<ref name=klotter119 /> He reminded his fellow senators that Congress had not approved a declaration of war and maintained that Lincoln's enlistment of men and expenditure of funds for the war effort were unconstitutional.<ref name=klotter119 /> If the Union could be persuaded not to attack the Confederacy, he predicted that "all those sentiments of common interest and feeling&nbsp;... might lead to a political reunion founded upon consent".<ref name=klotter119>Klotter, p. 119</ref> On August 1, he declared that if Kentucky supported Lincoln's prosecution of the war, "she will be represented by some other man on the floor of this Senate."<ref name=harrison130 /> Asked by Oregon's [[Edward Dickinson Baker]] how he would handle the secession crisis, he responded, "I would prefer to see these States all reunited upon true constitutional principles to any other object that could be offered me in life&nbsp;... But I infinitely prefer to see a peaceful separation of these States, than to see endless, aimless, devastating war, at the end of which I see the grave of public liberty and of personal freedom."<ref name=davis276>Davis, p. 276</ref> 

In early September, Confederate and Union forces entered Kentucky, ending her neutrality.<ref name=harrison130 /> On September 18, Unionists shut down the pro-Southern ''[[Louisville Courier-Journal|Louisville Courier]]'' newspaper and arrested former governor [[Charles S. Morehead]], who was suspected of having Confederate sympathies.<ref name=davis285>Davis, p. 285</ref> Learning that [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] [[Thomas E. Bramlette]] was under orders to arrest him, Breckinridge fled to [[Prestonsburg, Kentucky]], where he was joined by Confederate sympathizers [[George W. Johnson (governor)|George W. Johnson]], [[George Baird Hodge]], [[William E. Simms]], and William Preston.<ref name=heck104>Heck, p. 104</ref> The group continued to [[Abingdon, Virginia]], where they took a train to Confederate-held [[Bowling Green, Kentucky]].<ref name=heck104 /> 

On October 2, 1861, the Kentucky General Assembly passed a resolution declaring that neither of the state's U.S. Senators &ndash; Breckinridge and Powell &ndash; represented the will of the state's citizens and requesting that both resign.<ref name=davis296>Davis, p. 296</ref> Governor Magoffin refused to endorse the resolution, preventing its enforcement.<ref name=davis296 /> Writing from Bowling Green on October 8, Breckinridge declared, "I exchange with proud satisfaction a term of six years in the Senate of the United States for the musket of a soldier."<ref name=harrison130 /> Later that month, he was part of a convention in Confederate-controlled [[Russellville, Kentucky]], that denounced the Unionist legislature as not representing the will of most Kentuckians and called for a sovereignty convention to be held in that city on November 18.<ref name=nhok192>Harrison and Klotter, p. 192</ref> Breckinridge, George W. Johnson, and Humphrey Marshall were named to the planning committee, but Breckinridge did not attend the convention, which created a provisional [[Confederate government of Kentucky|Confederate government]] for Kentucky.<ref name=nhok192 /> On November 6, Breckinridge was [[indictment|indicted]] for [[treason]] in a federal court in [[Frankfort, Kentucky|Frankfort]].<ref name=harrison130 /> The Senate passed a resolution formally expelling him on December 2, 1861; Powell was the only member to vote against the resolution, claiming that Breckinridge's statement of October 8 amounted to a resignation, rendering the resolution unnecessary.<ref name=davis296 />

==Confederate Secretary of War==
Breckinridge served in the Confederate Army from November 2, 1861, until early 1865.<ref name=eoc /> In mid-January 1865, [[President of the Confederate States of America|Confederate President]] Jefferson Davis summoned Breckinridge to the Confederate capital at [[Richmond, Virginia]], and rumors followed that Davis would appoint Breckinridge [[Confederate States Secretary of War]], replacing [[James A. Seddon]].<ref name=heck132>Heck, p. 132</ref><ref name=davis478>Davis, p. 478</ref> Breckinridge arrived in Richmond on January 17, and some time in the next two weeks, Davis offered him the appointment.<ref>Davis, pp. 478&ndash;479</ref> Breckinridge made his acceptance conditional upon the removal of [[Lucius B. Northrop]] from his office as Confederate [[Commissary General]].<ref name=davis480>Davis, p. 480</ref> Most Confederate officers regarded Northrop as inept, but Davis had long defended him.<ref name=davis480 /> Davis relented on January 30, allowing Seddon to replace Northrop with Breckinridge's friend, [[Eli Metcalfe Bruce]], on an interim basis; Breckinridge accepted Davis's appointment the next day.<ref name=davis480 /> 

[[File:John C. Breckinridge statue Lexington KY.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A statue of a mustachioed man with his right hand extended|A Lexington, Kentucky, statue honoring Breckinridge depicts him with the mustache he grew during the war.]]
Some Confederate congressmen were believed to oppose Breckinridge because he had waited so long to join the Confederacy, but his nomination was confirmed unanimously on February 6, 1865.<ref name=heck132 /><ref name=klotter128>Klotter in ''The Breckinridges of Kentucky'', p. 128</ref> At 44 years old, he was the youngest person to serve in the Confederate president's cabinet.<ref name=davis480 /> Klotter called Breckinridge "perhaps the most effective of those who held that office", but Harrison wrote that "no one could have done much with the War Department at that late date".<ref name=kye118 /><ref name=harrison131>Harrison, p. 131</ref> While his predecessors had largely served Davis's interests, Breckinridge functioned independently, assigning officers, recommending promotions, and consulting on strategy with Confederate generals.<ref name=harrison131 />

Breckinridge's first act as secretary was to meet with assistant secretary [[John Archibald Campbell]], who had opposed Breckinridge's nomination, believing he would focus on a select few of the department's bureaus and ignore the rest.<ref>Davis, pp. 485&ndash;486</ref> During their conference, Campbell expressed his desire to retain his post, and Breckinridge agreed, delegating many of the day-to-day details of the department's operation to him.<ref name=klotter128 /><ref name=davis486>Davis, p. 486</ref> Breckinridge recommended that Davis appoint [[Isaac M. St. John]], head of the Confederate Mining and Nitre Bureau, as permanent commissary general.<ref name=davis487>Davis, p. 487</ref> Davis made the appointment on February 15, and the flow of supplies to Confederate armies improved under St. John.<ref name=davis487 /><ref name=heck133>Heck, p. 133</ref> With Confederate ranks plagued by desertion, Breckinridge instituted a [[conscription|draft]]; when this proved ineffective, he negotiated the resumption of [[prisoner exchange]]s with the Union in order to replenish the Confederates' depleted manpower.<ref name=davis491>Davis, p. 491</ref>

By late February, Breckinridge had concluded that the Confederate cause was hopeless.<ref name=harrison131 /> He opposed the use of [[guerilla warfare]] by Confederate forces and urged a national surrender.<ref name=eoc /> Meeting with Confederate senators from [[Virginia]], Kentucky, [[Missouri]], and [[Texas]], he urged, "This has been a magnificent epic. In God's name let it not terminate in a farce."<ref name=heck133 /> In April, with Union forces approaching Richmond, Breckinridge organized the escape of the other cabinet officials to [[Danville, Virginia]].<ref name=heck134>Heck, p. 134</ref> Afterward, he ordered the burning of the bridges over the [[James River]] and ensured the destruction of buildings and supplies that might aid the enemy.<ref name=klotter128 /><ref name=harrison131 /> During the surrender of the city, he helped preserve the Confederate government and military records housed there.<ref name=eoc />

After a brief rendezvous with [[Robert E. Lee]]'s retreating forces at [[Farmville, Virginia]], Breckinridge moved south to [[Greensboro, North Carolina]], where he, [[Confederate States Secretary of the Navy|Naval Secretary]] [[Stephen Mallory]], and Postmaster General [[John Henninger Reagan]] joined Generals [[Joseph E. Johnston]] and [[P. G. T. Beauregard]] to urge surrender.<ref name=davis507>Davis, p. 507</ref> Davis and [[Confederate States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Judah P. Benjamin]] initially resisted, but eventually asked [[Major General (United States)|Major General]] [[William T. Sherman]] to parley.<ref name=heck135>Heck, p. 135</ref> Johnston and Breckinridge negotiated terms with Sherman, but President Andrew Johnson (who had assumed the presidency on [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln's assassination]] on April 15) rejected them as too generous.<ref>Heck, pp. 135&ndash;136</ref><ref name=harrison138>Harrison, p. 138</ref> On Davis' orders, Breckinridge told Johnston to meet [[Richard Taylor (general)|Richard Taylor]] in Alabama, but Johnston, believing his men would refuse to fight any longer, surrendered to Sherman on similar terms to those offered to Lee at [[Battle of Appomattox Court House|Appomattox]].<ref name=heck136>Heck, p. 136</ref> 

After the failed negotiations, Confederate Attorney General [[George Davis (politician)|George Davis]] and [[Confederate States of America Secretary of the Treasury|Confederate Treasury Secretary]] [[George Trenholm]] resigned.<ref name=davis518>Davis, p. 518</ref> The rest of the Confederate cabinet &ndash; escorted by over 2,000 cavalrymen under [[Basil W. Duke]] and Breckinridge's nephew [[William Campbell Preston Breckinridge]] &ndash; traveled southwest to meet Taylor at [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]].<ref name=davis518 /> Believing that the Confederate cause was not yet lost, Davis convened a [[council of war]] on May 2 in [[Abbeville, South Carolina]], but the cavalry commanders told him that the only cause for which their men would fight was to aid Davis's escape from the country.<ref name=heck137>Heck, p. 137</ref><ref>Davis, pp. 519&ndash;520</ref> Informed that gold and silver coins and bullion from the Confederate treasury were at the train depot in Abbeville, Breckinridge ordered Duke to load it onto wagons and guard it as they continued southward.<ref name=klotter129>Klotter in ''The Breckinridges of Kentucky'', p. 129</ref><ref name=davis520>Davis, p. 520</ref> ''En route'' to [[Washington, Georgia]], some members of the cabinet's escort threatened to take their back salaries by force.<ref name=klotter129 /> Breckinridge had intended to wait until their arrival to make the payments, but to avoid mutiny, he dispersed some of the funds immediately.<ref name=heck137 /> Two brigades deserted immediately after being paid; the rest continued to Washington, where the remaining funds were deposited in a local bank.<ref>Heck, pp. 137&ndash;138</ref> 

Discharging most of the remaining escort, Breckinridge left Washington with a small party on May 5, hoping to distract federal forces from the fleeing Confederate president.<ref name=heck138>Heck, p. 138</ref> Between Washington and [[Woodstock, Georgia|Woodstock]], the party was overtaken by Union forces under [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Andrew K. Campbell]]; Breckinridge ordered his nephew to surrender while he, his sons Cabell and [[Clifton R. Breckinridge|Clifton]], James B. Clay, Jr., and a few others fled into the nearby woods.<ref name=davis524>Davis, p. 524</ref> At [[Sandersville, Georgia|Sandersville]], he sent Clay and Clifton home, announcing that he and the rest of his companions would proceed to [[Madison, Florida]].<ref name=davis525>Davis, p. 525</ref> On May 11, they reached [[Milltown, Georgia]], where Breckinridge expected to rendezvous with Davis, but on May 14, he learned of Davis's capture days earlier.<ref name=davis528>Davis, p. 528</ref>

==Later life==
Besides marking the end of the Confederacy and the war, Davis's capture left Breckinridge as the highest-ranking former Confederate still at large.<ref name=ewb /> Fearing arrest, he fled to Cuba, [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]], and [[Canada]], where he lived in exile.<ref name=kye118 /> Andrew Johnson issued a proclamation of amnesty for all former Confederates in December 1868, and Breckinridge returned home the following March.<ref name=kye118 /> Friends and government officials, including President [[Ulysses S. Grant]], urged him to return to politics, but he declared himself "an extinct volcano" and never sought public office again.<ref name=ewb /><ref name=eoc /> He died of complications from war-related injuries on May 17, 1875.<ref name=heck160>Heck, p. 160</ref>
