==The massacre==
The Cave of the Patriarchs is divided into two sections, one for Jewish worshippers and the other for Muslim worshippers. The section for the Jewish worshippers includes the [[Abraham]] Hall, which is also used for [[brit milah]] ceremonies, and the [[Jacob]] Hall. A [[Yeshiva]]h has also been set up. Numerous Jewish [[Jewish services|religious services]] take place every day in this section of the Cave. The section for Muslim worshippers includes the much larger [[Isaac]] Hall. On ten days in the year the entire cave is reserved for the exclusive use of Jewish worshippers and on ten other days in the year for the exclusive use of Muslim worshippers.

At 05:00 a.m. on February 25, eight hundred [[Palestine|Palestinian]] [[Muslim]]s passed through the east gate of the cave to participate in [[Fajr]], the first of the [[Salah|five daily Islamic prayers]].<ref>Report of Shamgar Commission p. 15; Timetable of Events, Exhibit 14, (ISA 7645/1-1/gimmel)</ref> The cave was under [[GOC Army Headquarters|Israeli Army]] guard, but of the nine soldiers supposed to have been on duty, four were late turning up and only one officer was there.{{ref|guardian270294}}

Shortly afterwards Baruch Goldstein, a Jewish resident of the [[Kiryat Arba]] settlement and member of the extremist Kahanist movement, entered the Isaac Hall of the cave. He was dressed in his army uniform and carrying an [[IMI Galil]] [[assault rifle]] and four magazines of ammunition, which held 35 rounds each. He was not stopped by the guards, who assumed that he was an officer entering the tomb to pray in an adjacent chamber reserved for Jews.{{ref|guardian250294}}

Standing in front of the only exit from the cave and positioned to the rear of the Muslim worshippers, he opened fire with the weapon, killing 29 people and injuring another 125, that is 154 casualties with 140 rounds.
He was eventually overwhelmed by survivors, who beat him to death.  State Attorney Dorit Benish refused to prosecute those who killed Goldstein after disarming him.<ref>[http://www.intellectualconservative.com/article3182.html A.

Reports after the massacre were inevitably highly confused. In particular, there was uncertainty about whether Goldstein had acted alone; it was reported that eyewitnesses had seen "another man, also dressed as a soldier, handing him ammunition."<ref>"Hebron Massacre: Hell comes to a holy place", ''The Independent'' (London), 27 February 1994</ref> There were also reports that he had thrown [[grenade]]s into the worshippers.{{ref|guardian250294}} The Palestinian leader [[Yasser Arafat]] claimed that the attack was the work of up to 12 men, including Israeli troops. However, a preliminary Israeli Army investigation, and the more thorough commission later set up, found that there had been no use of grenades and that Goldstein had acted alone without the assistance or connivance of the Israeli guards posted at the cave.{{ref|guardian270294}}

==Response==
===Israeli government===
Goldstein's actions were immediately condemned by the Israeli government, the mainstream Israeli parties and the Israeli populace in general.<ref>http://palestinefacts.org/pf_1991to_now_israel_hebron_shooting_1994.php</ref> Spokespeople for all the organized denominations of [[Judaism]] denounced his act as immoral and as terrorism. The [[Kach and Kahane Chai|Kach]] movement, to which he belonged, was outlawed as a terrorist organization. The cabinet agreed to take away the weapons of some [[Far-right|right-wing extremists]] and put them in administrative detention. 

In an address to the [[Knesset]], Prime Minister [[Yitzhak Rabin]] denounced the US-born Goldstein as a "foreign implant" and an "errant weed". He continued, "We say to this horrible man and those like him: you are a shame on [[Zionism]] and an embarrassment to Judaism." [[Binyamin Netanyahu]], head of the right of centre [[Likud]] party declared, "This was a despicable crime. I express my unequivocal condemnation."<ref>quotes from ''[[The Jewish Chronicle]]'' (London) [[4 March]] [[1994]], pages 1 and 2</ref>

====Shamgar Commission====
The [[Israel]]i government appointed an official and independent commission of inquiry headed by then president of the [[Supreme Court of Israel|Supreme Court]], [[Meir Shamgar|Judge Meir Shamgar]]. It found that: 
*[[Baruch Goldstein|Goldstein]] acted alone in planning the massacre, telling no one of his scheme.<ref>Commission of Inquiry Into the Massacre at the Tomb of the Patriarchs in Hebron - [http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Government/Law/Legal%20Issues%20and%20Rulings/COMMISSION%20OF%20INQUIRY-%20MASSACRE%20AT%20THE%20TOMB%20OF%20THE Excerpts from the Report]</ref>
*Coordination between the [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]], the police, and the Civil Administration was problematic. 
*The political leadership and [[Shin Bet|security forces]] could not have been expected to predict the massacre.
*Testimony from survivors referring to [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] assistance and grenade explosions in the massacre was found to be contradictory and inconsistent; investigators did not find any grenade fragments.{{ref|mfa}}

===Jewish diaspora===
In [[United Kingdom|Britain]] the Chief Rabbi [[Jonathan Sacks|Dr. Jonathan Sacks]] stated "Such an act is an obscenity and a travesty of Jewish values. That it should have been perpetrated against worshippers in a house of prayer at a holy time makes it a [[blasphemy]] as well." He continued, "Violence is evil. Violence committed in the name of God is doubly evil. Violence against those engaged in worshipping God is unspeakably evil."<ref>''[[The Jewish Chronicle]]'' (London) [[4 March]] [[1994]], page 1 and then expanded on page 23 </ref>

An editorial in ''[[The Jewish Chronicle]] ''written by [[Chaim Bermant]] denounced the Kach organisation to which Goldstein belonged as [[Neo-Nazi|"Neo-Nazis"]] and a U.S. creation, funded by American money and a product of American gun culture.<ref name="bermant">Chaim Bermant ''Has one settler settled the settlers future?'' in ''[[The Jewish Chronicle]]'' (London), [[4 March]] [[1994]]</ref> The same edition also reported that some [[Liberal Judaism|liberal]] synagogues in the UK had begun fund-raising for Goldstein's victims.<ref>The Jewish Chronicle'' (London), 4 March 1994</ref>

===Protests and violence===
Angry mobs began rioting in the aftermath of the massacre, which led to the deaths of 26 more [[Palestinian]]s and 9 [[Israelis]]. In [[Amman]], [[Jordan]], 77-year-old British tourist Howard Long was stabbed by Arab protesters. The attacker, Khalid Husni Al-Korashi, was subsequently arrested and the Jordanian Interior Ministry called for its citizens to show calm and restraint in their response.<ref name=Barsky>Barsky, Yehudit. [http://www.ajc.org/site/apps/nl/content3.asp?c=ijITI2PHKoG&b=846739&ct=1044053 ''The Brooklyn Bridge Shooting: An Independent Report and Assessment'']. The [[American Jewish Committee]]. Nov. 2000. Accessed [[June 12]], [[2006]].</ref>

===Other reactions===
Some who knew him say Goldstein experienced an emotional crisis in December, when two of his friends were ambushed by Arab attackers near Kiryat Arba, the West Bank settlement just outside the Palestinian city of Hebron that has long been a magnet for the most aggressive Jewish ultranationalists. As head of the local emergency medical team, Goldstein was called, and Mordechai Lapid and his 19-year-old son died in his arms.<ref>^ The Making of a Murderous Fanatic, 'Time, March 7, 1994.</ref> Goldstein is not known to have given any reasons for his actions. However, immediately after the attack, Mike Guzofsky, spokesman for [[Kahane Chai]] in [[New York City|New York]] and a close friend of Goldstein said, "He wanted to stop the [[Oslo Accords|peace process]] dead. He couldn't have picked a better day <U+2013> [[Purim]], when Jews fight back."<ref name="paulandfrazer">Geoffrey Paul (New York) and Jenni Frazer (Jerusalem) ''From Brooklyn to Kirya Arba'' in ''The Jewish Chronicle'' (London), [[4 March]] [[1994]].</ref> 
At Goldstein's eulogy Rabbi Dov Lior of Kiryat Arba stated: "Goldstein could not continue to bear all the cases he was seeing as a doctor; he might have gone insane from all he went through."<ref name="baum">Ilana Baum and Tzvi Singer in ''Yediot Aharonot,'' [[28 February]] [[1994]].</ref> According to Dr. Manfred R. Lehmann, Goldstein, in his capacity of head medical officer in Kiryat Arba, was aware of inside information warning of an upcoming Arab progrom and acted in order to prevent this.<ref name="year">[http://www.public-action.com/x/nh-baruch-lubavitch/ One Year Later - Purim Hebron 1994 Remembered]</ref> He also claims that the the good name of Goldstein at that time was testified to by his promotion to Major and the lengthy letter of promotion saying "If there is an officer in the District of Judea and Samaria worthy of promotion in rank it is without doubt Dr. (Captain) Baruch Goldstein."<ref name="year"/> 

A poll of 500 Israeli adults for the International Centre for Peace in the Middle East found that 78.8 percent of people condemned the Hebron massacre while 3.6 percent praised Goldstein.<ref>''[[The Jewish Chronicle]]'' (London) [[4 March]] [[1994]], page 2</ref>

As a reaction to the trauma induced in children of the city the [[Palestinian Child Arts Center]] (PCAC), a non-governmental, non-profit organization was founded. The activities of the centre primarily involve the intellectual development of Palestinian children, and to reinforce a positive role for the child within Palestinian society and culture.<ref>Irving Epstein (2008) The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Children's Issues Worldwide Greenwood Press, ISBN 0313338787 p 197</ref>
