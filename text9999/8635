'''Syd Dale''' (20 May 1924 in [[York]] &ndash; 15 August 1994) was an English self-taught [[composer]] and [[arranger]] of [[funk]], [[easy listening]] and [[library music]]. His music played an important role on [[TV]], [[radio]] and [[advertising]] [[Mass media|media]] of the 1960s and 1970s and is still used.

==Biography==
Dale started as an apprentice [[engineer]] at [[Rowntree's]] chocolate factory at 16. Soon [[big band]] music, very popular in the 1940s, became his passion. He spent as much time as possible listening to the Big Bands and studying the arrangements. Three years later, in 1945, he  left the factory and joined several local bands as [[pianist]] and [[arranger]].

His music, which emphasized melody and harmony with intricate arrangements, was composed for many [[television]] and [[radio]] projects. He was musical director on ''[[Oh, Boy! (TV series)|Oh Boy]]'', ''[[Six-Five Special]]'' and ''[[Braden's Week]]''. He had also co-arranged and co-produced some ''007'' themes as many other commercial successes. Another of his many [[production music]] pieces, the [[bongo drum]] and [[harpsichord]]-driven "Cuban Presto" (originally released on the 1966 KPM album ''Accent on Percussion''), was used by [[WPIX]] (Channel 11) in [[New York City]] as the theme for its late-night movie show, ''The Channel 11 Film Festival'', from the late 1960s to the 1980s.

In 1971, he founded [[Amphonic Music]] [[record label]], with the purpose of recording and producing his compositions and supplying music to the [[TV]], [[film]] and [[radio]] business.

In the mid-1970s, he released a track for the disco/teen market called "The Flasher", creating a dance craze of skipping backwards and forwards on the dance floor widely demonstrated at Spenborough Youth Club, West Yorkshire.

Through the 1970s and 1980s his "The Hellraisers" composition was used as the theme music to the [[BBC World Service]] ''[[Outlook (radio programme)|Outlook]]'' topical programme.

In the 1970s, another composition of Dale's, "Walk and Talk", was used as the introductory music to the [[BBC]]'s transmitter information, usually broadcast on [[BBC 2]] in the mornings.[http://www.transdiffusion.org/tv/halcyondays/1970s/hidden],[http://www.whr.org.uk/cds/cddetail.php?CDID=WHRCD101].

His music is still used in productions today. For example, his "[[Beauty Parade]]" was used in the ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'' episode "[[Spy Buddies]]" when [[Sheldon J. Plankton|Plankton]] get all of the customers out of [[Mr. Krabs]]'s restaurant, the Krusty Krab. Plankton played it very loudly while flying over the Krusty Krab in his [[blimp]]. In the TV comedy series ''[[Episodes (TV series)|Episodes]]'', the tune "Two Time" is the ringtone on [[Matt Leblanc]]'s iPhone. "Man Friday" was used as the theme tune to [[LWT]]'s Tarrant on TV; and in the episode of "Speed 3" with Milkman Pat Mustard, in ''[[Father Ted]]''.

Dale's tracks have been widely used by [[NFL Films]] over some four decades; his track "Artful Dodger" is given prominent use in such films as the official film recapping [[Super Bowl V]].
