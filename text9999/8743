The '''papal election from April 5, 1292 to July 5, 1294''' was the last papal election which did not take the form of a [[papal conclave]]. After the death of [[Pope Nicholas IV]] on April 4, 1292, the eleven surviving cardinals (a twelfth died during the ''[[sede vacante]]'') deliberated for more than two years before electing the third of six non-cardinals to be elected pope during the [[Later Middle Ages]], Pietro da Morrone, who took the name [[Pope Celestine V]].<ref name="miranda">Miranda, Salvator. 1998. "[http://www.fiu.edu/~mirandas/conclave-xiii.htm Election of April 5, 1292 - July 5, 1294: (Celestine V)."]</ref>

Contemporary sources suggest that Morrone was hesitant to accept his election when word of the cardinals' decision reached his mountain-top hermitage. His ascetic lifestyle left him largely unprepared for the day-to-day responsibilities of the papacy, and he quickly fell under the influence of the Neapolitan monarchy, to the dissatisfaction of even the pro-Angevin cardinals within the College. Within the year, on December 13, Celestine V became the last pope to [[Papal resignation|abdicate]] voluntarily.<ref name="miranda"/> 

==Cardinal electors==
Twelve cardinal electors began the election, but one&mdash;[[Jean Cholet]]&mdash;died before it was completed.

==Deliberation==
[[Image:Santa Maria sopra Minerva 2002-11.jpg|thumb|right|[[Santa Maria sopra Minerva]], where the election moved]]
The eleven electors were relatively evenly divided between the factions of [[Colonna family|Colonna]] and [[Orsini family|Orsini]], two powerful Roman families,<ref>Emerton, 1917, p. 111.</ref><ref>Williams, 2004, p. 37-38.</ref> led by [[Giacomo Colonna]] and [[Matteo Orsini]], respectively.<ref name="greg516">Gregorovius, 1906, p. 516.</ref> The three Orsini cardinals were pro-French and pro-[[Angevin]], while the two Colonna cardinals supported competing [[Aragonese]] claims in [[Sicily]].<ref>Baumgartner, 2003, p. 43.</ref> [[James II of Aragon]] had bankrolled the Colonna faction with gold, but it is unknown whether [[simony]] actually transpired.<ref>Baumgartner, 2003, p. 43-44.</ref>

After ten days of balloting in [[Rome]], without any candidate approaching the requisite two-thirds, the cardinals adjourned until June and changed the location of the election<ref name="b44">Baumgartner, 2003, p. 44.</ref> from [[Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore]] to [[Santa Maria sopra Minerva]].<ref name="greg516"/> After a summer epidemic in the city, and the death of Cholet in August, they dispersed until late September.<ref name="b44"/><ref name="greg517"/> The non-Roman cardinals went to [[Rieti]] (except Caetani, who went to his native [[Anagni]]) while the Roman cardinals remained in the city.<ref name="greg517">Gregorovius, 1906, p. 517.</ref> As balloting continued into the next summer, the disorder in Rome increased dramatically (even by the standards of a ''[[sede vacante]]'', during which, based on the biblical example of [[Barabbas]], all prisoners were released).<ref name="b44"/> The deaths of newly elected Roman Senators [[Agapitus Colonna]] and [[Ursus Orsini]] around [[Easter]] 1293 further exacerbated the anarchy within the city, which had been marked by the destruction of palaces, the slaying of pilgrims, and the sacking of churches.<ref name="greg517"/> After the summer of 1293, the cardinals dispersed and agreed to reconvene in [[Perugia]] on October 18.<ref name="b44"/><ref name="greg517"/>

The College continued to deliberate fruitlessly in Perugia, where they were addressed by [[Charles II of Naples]] in March 1294.<ref name="b44"/> By  the summer of 1294, cardinals had begun to disperse, leaving only six in Perugia for their final meeting, where a letter was read aloud from a hermit, Pierro de Morrone, stating that God had revealed to him that the cardinals would be punished for any further delay.<ref name="b44"/> [[Latino Malabranca Orsini]], the senior cardinal, suddenly nominated Morrone&mdash;who would have been well-known by the cardinals as a saintly figure&mdash;and the other cardinals rapidly agreed and recalled the departed electors to consent.<ref name="b44"/><ref>Toropov, 2002, p. 52.</ref><ref name="greg518">Gregorovius, 1906, p. 518.</ref>

Consensus was achieved by July 5, 1294, when Morrone was elected.<ref name="b45">Baumgartner, 2003, p. 45.</ref> As with the selection of Gregory X by the [[papal election, 1268<U+2013>1271]], the choice of an outsider, non-cardinal, in this case an "octogenarian hermit," was seen as the only way to break the stalemate between the deadlocked cardinals.<ref>Rotberg, 2001, p. 59.</ref> That election also could have resulted in the selection of a hermit, had [[Philip Benizi de Damiani|Saint Philip Benizi]] not fled to avoid his election after he urged the cardinals to speed up their deliberations.<ref>Baumgartner, 2003, p. 41.</ref>

==Coronation==
[[Image:NapoliMaschioAngioinoIngresso.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Castel Nuovo]] of [[Naples]], where [[Pope Celestine V|Celestine V]] took up residence]]
Pietro Colonna and three bishops brought the news of Morrone's election to his mountain-top hermitage.<ref>Gregorovius, 1906, p. 520.</ref> Contemporary sources are emphatic in noting Morrone's reluctance to accept his election; for example, [[Petrarch]] recounts his attempt to flee.<ref>''[[Vita solitaria]]'', ii, c. 18.</ref>

Instead of coming to [[Perugia]] (the site of the conclave), Celestine insisted that the cardinals join him in [[L'Aquila]] (in Neapolitan territory) for his [[papal coronation|coronation]], rather than crossing into the bordering [[Papal States]].<ref name="e112">Emerton, 1917, p. 112.</ref> Imitating the entry of Christ into Jerusalem,<ref name="greg522">Gregorovius, 1906, p. 522.</ref> Celestine rode a donkey, led by the [[bridle]] by [[Charles II of Naples]] and his son [[Charles Martel of Anjou]] <ref>Gregorovius, 1906, p. 521.</ref> to the L'Aquila basililca, which was the nearest cathedral to his hermitage.<ref name="b45"/> Latino Orsini died on August 10 in Perugia, but many of the other cardinals had second thoughts because of the perceived degree of Angevin control of the new pope.<ref name="greg522"/> Because only three cardinals were present at the ceremony on August 29, it was repeated a few days later when more arrived, making Celestine the first and only pope to be crowned twice.
[[Image:B Colestin V.jpg|thumb|right|[[Pope Celestine V]]]]
The Angevin-Neapolitan influence of Celestine was evident in his first [[consistory]], during which he created twelve cardinals, including seven Frenchmen and three (or five<ref>Collins, 2005, p. 111.</ref>) Neapolitans. This was the first time in history where a single conclave had swung the [[College of Cardinals]] so decidedly in one nationalist partisan direction.<ref name="e112"/> The cardinals who were not French or Angevin were members of Celestine's former order.<ref name="b45"/> Celestine also moved to the [[Castel Nuovo]] in [[Naples]], where he continued to live much like a hermit until he resigned, as advocated by many Roman cardinals, including Benedetto Gaetani (who, a former lawyer, suggested that Celestine first publish a decree establishing the permissibility of [[papal abdication]].)<ref name="e112"/> Gaetani, elected [[Pope Boniface VIII]] following Celestine's abdication, proceeded to have Celestine imprisoned while the legality of his abdication remained a prominent subject, and Celestine died a prisoner in 1296.<ref>Toropov, 2002, p. 52-53.</ref>

==Legacy==
Before abdicating, Celestine re-enacted ''[[Ubi Periculum]]'', the [[Apostolic Constitution]] of [[Pope Gregory X]], which has governed all subsequent papal elections under the laws of the conclave. Two subsequent papal elections may be considered possible exceptions, although they comported with the laws of the conclave to a great degree: the [[Council of Constance]], which elected [[Pope Martin V]] to end the [[Western Schism]] and the [[papal conclave, 1799-1800]], for which [[Pope Pius VI]] suspended ''Ubi Periculum'' due to the interference of [[Napoleon I of France]]).<ref>Trollope, 1876, p. 87.</ref>
