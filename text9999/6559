The '''National Popular Vote Interstate Compact (NPVIC)''' is an agreement that has been passed into the laws of certain [[U.S. state]]s. States endorsing this [[interstate compact]] have agreed they will replace their current rules governing the [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral college]] system of [[United States presidential election|presidential elections]] with rules guaranteeing election of the candidate with the most popular votes nationwide, once enough states to change the electoral college system have passed the same compact into their law. As of August 2011, the compact has been joined by eight states and the [[District of Columbia]] (see map); their 132 combined electoral votes amount to 24.5% of the electoral college and 49% of the 270 needed for the compact to go into effect.

The compact is based on [[Article Two of the United States Constitution#Clause 2: Method of choosing electors|Article II, Section 1]] of the [[U.S. Constitution]], which gives each state legislature the right to decide how to appoint its own electors. States have chosen various methods of allocation over the years, with regular changes in the nation's early decades. Today, all but two states award all of their electoral votes to the candidate with the most popular votes statewide.

States joining the compact will continue to award their electoral votes in their current manner until the compact has been joined by enough states to represent a controlling majority of the Electoral College (currently 270 of the total 538 electoral votes.) After that point, all of the electoral votes of the member states would be cast for the candidate who wins the most popular votes in all 50 states and the [[District of Columbia]]. With the national popular vote winner guaranteed a [[majority]] in the Electoral College, he or she would automatically win the Electoral College and therefore the presidency.

==Details of the compact law==
States join the compact by adopting it as a [[state law]].  The compact law<ref>{{cite web
|url=http://www.every-vote-equal.com/pdf/EVE-CH-6.pdf
|title=The Agreement Among the States to Elect the President by National Popular Vote
|work=Every Vote Equal
|accessdate=2010-12-22}}</ref> requires that:

* The member state shall hold presidential elections by statewide popular vote.
* After the election, the state's chief election official (usually the state [[Secretary of State (U.S. state government)|Secretary of State]]) shall certify the number of popular votes cast in the state for each candidate and report those results to the other states by a specific deadline.
* The chief election official shall then determine "national popular vote totals" for each candidate by adding up the vote totals reported by every state (including states that have not adopted the compact) and the District of Columbia. (Under current federal law, each state is required to make official reports of vote totals to the federal government in the form of Certificates of Ascertainment.)<ref>{{cite web

  | url = http://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/state_responsibilities.html#ascertain
  | accessdate = 2008-06-05}}</ref>
* The state's electoral votes shall be awarded to the candidate with the greatest "national popular vote total."

The compact member states would award their electoral votes to the electors nominated by the candidate with the greatest number of popular votes (a [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]]). In the extremely unlikely event of an exact [[tie (draw)|tie]] in the national popular vote totals, each member state would award its electoral votes to the statewide winner, as is currently done in 48 states ([[Maine]] and [[Nebraska]] award some of their electoral votes based on results at the congressional district level).

The compact specifies that it shall take effect only if it is law in states controlling a majority of electoral votes on July 20 of a presidential election year. States wishing to join or withdraw from the compact after that date would not be able to implement that withdrawal until after January 20 of the following year. The compact would terminate in the event that the Electoral College is abolished.

==Motivation behind the compact==
[[File:Support For Direct Popular Vote.png|thumb|120px|right|Source: ''[[The Washington Post]]'', [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/interactives/independents/post-kaiser-harvard-topline.pdf 2007 poll].]]{{See also2|[[Electoral College (United States)#Contemporary conflict over the Electoral College|Contemporary conflict over the Electoral College]]}}
Public opinion surveys suggest that a majority of Americans support the idea of a popular vote for president. A 2007 poll found that 72% favored replacing the Electoral College with a direct election, including 78% of [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]], 60% of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]], and 73% of [[independent (voter)|independent voters]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/interactives/independents/post-kaiser-harvard-topline.pdf |title=Washington Post-Kaiser Family Foundation-Harvard University: Survey of Political Independents |accessdate=2008-06-11|format=PDF | work=The Washington Post}}</ref>  Polls dating back to 1944 have shown a consistent majority of the public supporting a direct vote.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/2323/Americans-Historically-Favored-Changing-Way-Presidents-Elected.aspx |title=Americans Have Historically Favored Changing Way Presidents are Elected |publisher=Gallup |accessdate=2008-06-11 |date=2000-11-10}}</ref>  The idea is popular for various reasons:

*The Electoral College Votes system has an effect on presidential campaigns to focus disproportionately more on voters in a tiny percentage of pivotal [[swing states]], while sidelining the rest of the states.  A study by [[FairVote]] reported that the 2004 candidates devoted three quarters of their peak season campaign resources to just five states, while the other 45 states got very little attention.  The report also stated that 18 states received no candidate visits and no TV [[campaign advertising|advertising]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fairvote.org/presidential/?page=1677 |title=Who Picks the President? |publisher=FairVote |accessdate=2008-06-11}}</ref>  This may mean that swing state issues receive more attention while issues important to other states are largely ignored.<ref name=NYEd>{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/14/opinion/14tue1.html |title=Drop Out of the College |work=New York Times |date=2006-03-14 |accessdate=2008-06-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.denverpost.com/opinion/ci_5628615 |title=Electoral College is outdated |work=Denver Post |date=2007-04-09 |accessdate=2008-06-11}}</ref><ref name=HillKee>{{cite web |url=http://apr.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/33/5/700 |title=The Electoral College, Mobilization, and Turnout in the 2000 Presidential Election |author=Hill, David |coauthors=McKee, Seth C.

*The Electoral College Votes system may increase or decrease [[voter turnout]] disproportionately between states. Voters living outside the swing states tend to know more in advance the odds of which candidate is more likely to win their state.  This greater certainty of the winner and knowledge of the odds may tend to decrease the incentive of voters in non swing states to spend energy voting for an outcome they feel they can't change -disproportionately unlike swing states voters.<ref name=NYEd/><ref name=HillKee/>  A report by the Committee for the Study of the American Electorate found that [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004]] voter turnout in competitive swing states grew by 6.3% from the [[United States presidential election, 2000|previous presidential election]], compared to an increase of only 3.8% in noncompetitive states.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.american.edu/ia/cdem/csae/pdfs/csae041104.pdf |title=Committee for the Study of the American Electorate |date=2004-11-04 |accessdate=2008-06-12|format=PDF}}</ref>  A report by The Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement (CIRCLE) found that turnout among eligible voters under age 30 was 64.4% in the 10 closest battleground states and only 47.6% in the rest of the country<U+2014>a 17% gap.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.civicyouth.org/PopUps/FactSheets/FS_Youth_Voting_72-04.pdf |title=The Youth Vote 2004 |author=Lopez, Mark Hugo |coauthors=Kirby, Emily;Sagoff, Jared |year=2005 |month=July |accessdate=2008-06-12|format=PDF}}</ref>

*There is debate over whether the Electoral College favors small or large population states. Those who argue that it favors small states point out that such states have more electoral votes relative to their populations (since the number of electors equals the number of representatives, based on population, plus two, because there are two senators).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/election/july-dec00/bbo_11-6.html |title=David Broder, on PBS Online News Hour's Campaign Countdown |date=2000-11-06 |accessdate=2008-06-12}}</ref><ref name=Hono>{{cite news |url=http://archives.starbulletin.com/2007/04/29/editorial/editorial02.html |title=Electoral College should be maintained |work=Honolulu Star-Bulletin |accessdate=2008-06-12 |date=2007-04-29}}</ref>  Others, however, believe that since most states award electoral votes on a winner-takes-all system, the potential of large states to shift greater numbers of electoral votes gives them more actual clout.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/id/1006680 |work=Slate.com |title=Faithless Elector Watch: Gimme "Equal Protection" |author=Timothy Noah |date=2000-12-13 |accessdate=2008-06-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/book.asp?isbn=0300080360 |first=Lawrence D. |last=Longley |coauthors=Peirce, Neal |title=Electoral College Primer 2000 |publisher=Yale University Press |year=1999}}{{dead link|date=August 2011|url=http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/book.asp?isbn=0300080360}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Law/ConstitutionalLaw/?view=usa&ci=9780195307511 |first=Sanford |last=Levinson |title=Our Undemocratic Constitution |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2006}}{{Dead link|url=http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Law/ConstitutionalLaw/?view=usa&ci=9780195307511|date=November 2008}}</ref>

*The Electoral College allows a candidate to win the presidency while losing the popular vote, as happened in the elections of [[United States presidential election, 1876|1876]], [[United States presidential election, 1888|1888]] and [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000]]. In each of these races, a Democrat won the popular vote while losing the electoral vote (and thus the election) to a Republican. In 2000, for example, Democrat [[Al Gore]] lost the election despite beating Republican [[George W. Bush]] in the popular vote.  Republicans are not immune to this artifact of the electoral college, either, as Bush would have faced Gore's situation himself in 2004 if there had been a 60,000 vote shift to [[John Kerry]] in [[Ohio]].<ref name=NYEd/>

Some of the major issues are detailed below:

===Focus of campaigning===
[[File:Spending-and-visits.svg|thumb|Advertising spending and campaign visits by both major-party candidates during the final stretch of the 2004 presidential campaign (Sept. 26 <U+2013> Nov. 2, 2004)<ref>{{cite web | title = Who Picks the President? | publisher = FairVote | date = | url = http://archive.fairvote.org/media/research/who_picks_president.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 09-11-2011 }}</ref><br><br>

{{color sample|#7e007e}} 3<U+2013>9 <br>
{{color sample|#000000}} > 9 <br></p>
]]

Supporters of the compact argue that under the current system, campaign focus <U+2013> in terms of advertising spending, visits, and addressing of regional or state issues <U+2013> is largely limited to the few swing states whose electoral outcomes are competitive, with politically "solid" states largely ignored. The maps to the right illustrate the amount spent on advertising and the number of visits to each state, relative to population, by the two major-party candidates in the last stretch of the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential campaign]]. Supporters of the compact contend that a national popular vote would encourage candidates to campaign with equal effort for votes in competitive and non-competitive states alike.<ref>[http://www.fairvote.org/what-is-the-national-popular-vote-plan FairVote.org | What is the National Popular Vote Plan?: Facts & FAQ's<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Critics of the compact argue that candidates would have less incentive to focus on states with smaller populations or fewer urban areas, and would thus be unmotivated to address rural issues.<ref name=Pont/><ref name=NPVmemo>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalpopularvote.com/resources/7-Page-NPV-Memo-V33-2007-6-1.pdf |title=National Popular Vote |date=2007-06-01|accessdate=2008-07-13 |publisher=National Popular Vote|format=PDF}}</ref>

===Close elections and voter fraud===

Opponents of the compact have suggested that a direct national election would raise concerns about election fraud. Former Delaware Governor [[Pierre S. du Pont, IV|Pete du Pont]] argues that in 2000, "Mr. Gore's 540,000-vote margin amounted to 3.1 votes in each of the country's 175,000 precincts. 'Finding' three votes per precinct in urban areas is not a difficult thing...". However, National Popular Vote has argued that a direct election would reduce the likelihood of a close election and decrease the feasibility of fraud.  They contend that the large nationwide pool of 122 million votes would make a close outcome much less likely than it is under the current system, in which the national winner may be determined by an extremely small vote margin in any one of the numerous statewide tallies.<ref name=Pont/><ref name=NPVmemo/>

===Third-party candidates and polarization ===

Although supporters of the compact point out that direct election is already the method by which Americans elect their members of Congress, state leaders and local officials, opponents such as du Pont have argued that a direct popular vote in presidential contests could lead to a change in the current two party system.  They contend that the difficulty of winning electoral votes under the current system may discourage [[third party (politics)|third party]] and single-issue candidates from running, and therefore switching to a popular vote may lead more third party and single-issue candidates to enter the race.  Furthermore, it is thought that an increase in the number of candidates will actually change the nature of the American political system, by preventing candidates from being too polarizing, outing a perceived media bias on both ends of the political spectrum, and making so-called 'attack ads' less politically beneficial.<ref name=Pont/>{{Dead link|date=May 2011}}<ref>{{cite web |title=Count 'Em |first=Hendrik |last=Hertzberg |url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/03/06/060306ta_talk_hertzberg |work=The New Yorker |date=2006-03-06 |accessdate=2008-07-13}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=May 2011}}

===Possible partisan advantage===

Some supporters and opponents of the NPVIC have based their position at least in part on the perceived partisan advantage of the compact. Former Delaware Governor [[Pierre DuPont]], a Republican, has argued that the compact would be an "urban power grab" and benefit Democrats.<ref name="Pont"/> However, [[Saul Anuzis]] of the Republican National Committee wrote that Republicans "need" the compact, citing what he believes to be the center right nature of the American electorate.<ref name=Anuzis>{{cite web |title= ANUZIS: Conservatives need the popular vote |first=Saul |last=Anuzis |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/may/26/anuzis-conservatives-need-the-popular-vote/ |work=Washington Times |date=2006-05-26 |accessdate=2011-06-03}}</ref> ''New Yorker'' essayist Hendrik Hertzberg maintains that the compact would benefit neither party by noting that historically both Republicans and Democrats have been successful in winning the popular vote in past presidential elections.<ref name=Hertzberg>{{cite web |title= Misguided "objectivity" on n.p.v |first=Hendrik |last=Hertzberg |url= http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/hendrikhertzberg/2011/06/misguided-objectivity-on-npv.html|work=New Yorker |date=2011-06-13 |accessdate=2011-06-21}}</ref>

===Electoral votes not necessarily awarded to statewide winner===

Two governors who have vetoed NPVIC legislation, [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] of California and [[Linda Lingle]] of Hawaii, both in 2007, objected to the compact on the grounds that it could require their states' electoral votes to be awarded to a candidate who did not win statewide. Both states have since enacted laws joining the compact. Supporters of the compact have countered that under the popular vote system, the awarding of electoral votes would be effectively irrelevant; that giving the state's electoral votes to the national winner would be a mere symbolic formality with no political meaning, because the popular vote would have already determined the outcome.<ref>[http://info.sen.ca.gov/pub/07-08/bill/sen/sb_0001-0050/sb_37_cfa_20070503_145220_sen_floor.html SB-37, quoted on page 8]</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://archives.starbulletin.com/2007/04/24/news/briefs.html |work=Honolulu Star-Bulletin |title=NewsWatch |date=2007-04-24 |accessdate=2008-07-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=What's Wrong With the Popular Vote? |url=http://www.hawaiireporter.com/story.aspx?6ddf1e11-986b-4a18-ab2d-dac2925fbcaa |work=Hawaii Reporter |date=2007-04-11 |accessdate=2008-07-13 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080110014711/http://www.hawaiireporter.com/story.aspx?6ddf1e11-986b-4a18-ab2d-dac2925fbcaa |archivedate = January 10, 2008}}</ref>

===Legality===
Supporters believe the compact is legal because Article II of the US Constitution establishes the plenary power of the states to appoint their electors in any manner they see fit:
{{cquote|Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a Number of Electors, equal to the whole Number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress<U+2026>.}}
The Supreme Court affirmed this position as recently as 2000 in ''[[Bush v. Gore]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://straylight.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/00-949.ZPC.html|title=Bush v. Gore, US Supreme Court Opinion|quote=The individual citizen has no federal constitutional right to vote for electors for the President of the United States unless and until the state legislature chooses a statewide election as the means to implement its power to appoint members of the Electoral College. U.S. Const., Art. II, <U+00A7>1. This is the source for the statement in ''[[McPherson v. Blacker]]'', 146 U.S. 1, 35 (1892), that the State legislature<U+2019>s power to select the manner for appointing electors is plenary; it may, if it so chooses, select the electors itself, which indeed was the manner used by State legislatures in several States for many years after the Framing of our Constitution. Id., at 28<U+2014>33. History has now favored the voter, and in each of the several States the citizens themselves vote for Presidential electors. When the state legislature vests the right to vote for President in its people, the right to vote as the legislature has prescribed is fundamental; and one source of its fundamental nature lies in the equal weight accorded to each vote and the equal dignity owed to each voter.}}</ref>  These supporters include [[Jamie Raskin]], who co-sponsored the first NPVIC bill to be signed into law, and [[Akhil Reed Amar]] and [[Vikram Amar]], who are among the nation's more visible scholars in constitutional law<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.legalaffairs.org/poll/ |title=Who Are the Top 20 Legal Thinkers in America? |accessdate=2008-07-04 |work=Legal Affairs |publisher= |date= }}</ref> and who were the compact's original proponents.

David Gringer, however, suggests that the NPVIC could potentially violate the [[Voting Rights Act]] depending on how the Supreme Court would define "coalitional" or "influence" districts.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Why the National Popular Vote Plan Is the Wrong Way to Abolish the Electoral College |url=http://www.columbialawreview.org/assets/pdfs/108/1/Gringer.pdf |first=David|last=Gringer |journal=Columbia Law Review |accessdate=2008-07-13 |year=2008 |volume=108 |issue=1 |format=PDF}}</ref> Robert Richie, executive director of FairVote, disputed such claims and said he was "confident in the legality of a rule change that treats all voters equally and is founded on the power given by the Constitution to the states."<ref>{{cite web |title=Democracy's Revenge? Bush v. Gore and the National Popular Vote |url=http://moritzlaw.osu.edu/electionlaw/comments/2006/060516.php |first=Peter|last=Shane |publisher=Moritz College of Law, Ohio State University |date=2006-05-16 |accessdate=2008-07-13}}</ref>

Gringer also assailed the NPVIC as "an [[end run|end-run]] around the constitutional amendment process." Raskin has responded: "the term 'end run' has no known constitutional or legal meaning. More to the point, to the extent that we follow its meaning in real usage, the 'end run' is a perfectly lawful play."<ref>{{cite journal |title=Neither the Red States nor the Blue States but the United States: The National Popular Vote and American Political Democracy |url=http://www.liebertonline.com/doi/pdfplus/10.1089/elj.2008.7304 |first=Jamie|last=Raskin |journal=Election Law Journal: Rules, Politics, and Policy |publisher=Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. |accessdate=2009-12-06 |year=2008 |volume=7 |issue=3 |format=PDF |doi=10.1089/elj.2008.7304 |page=188}}</ref> Raskin argues that the adoption of the term "end run" by the compact's opponents is a tacit acknowledgment of the plan's legality.

===Possible need for congressional approval===
Although supporters of the compact believe the compact would be valid without congressional approval, some critics maintain that the congressional approval is necessary before the NPVIC can go into effect. [[Compact Clause|Article I, Section 10]] of the US Constitution states that <blockquote>No State shall, without the Consent of Congress, ... enter into any Agreement or Compact with another State.</blockquote> ''Every Vote Equal'' argues that the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] has ruled in ''[[Virginia v. Tennessee]]'', {{ussc|148|503|1893}}, and several more recent cases, that such consent is not necessary except where a compact encroaches on federal supremacy.<ref>{{cite book |title=Every Vote Equal |chapter=Background on Interstate Compacts |chapterurl=http://www.every-vote-equal.com/pdf/EVE-CH-5.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-06-15}}</ref> ''Every Vote Equal'' argues that the compact could never encroach upon federal power since the Constitution explicitly gives the power of casting electoral votes to the states, not the federal government.

==History==
The idea of abolishing the Electoral College by [[Article Five of the United States Constitution|constitutional amendment]] has existed for some time (see [[Every Vote Counts Amendment]]).  Though voting rights and electoral rules have been modified by constitutional amendment in the past, such amendments are difficult to pass because they require [[supermajority|supermajorities]] in the [[U.S. House of Representatives|House]] and [[United States Senate|Senate]] together with the support of three-fourths of the [[State legislature (United States)|state legislature]]s.

===Academic plan===
In 2001 Northwestern University law professor Robert Bennett suggested a plan in an academic publication to implement a National Popular Vote through a mechanism that would ''embrace'' state legislatures<U+2019> power to appoint electors, rather than resist that power.<ref name="Bennett">[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=261057 Popular Election of the President Without a Constitutional Amendment by Robert Bennett :: SSRN<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  By coordinating, states constituting a majority of the Electoral College could effectively implement a popular vote.

Law professors (and brothers) [[Akhil Reed Amar]] and [[Vikram Amar]] defended the constitutionality of such a plan.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://writ.lp.findlaw.com/amar/20011228.html |title=HOW TO ACHIEVE DIRECT NATIONAL ELECTION OF THE PRESIDENT WITHOUT AMENDING THE CONSTITUTION: Part Three Of A Three-part Series On The 2000 Election And The Electoral College |publisher=Findlaw |year=2001 |accessdate=2009-03-16}}</ref>  They proposed that a group of states, through legislation, form a compact wherein they agree to give all of their electoral votes to the national popular vote winner, regardless of the balance of votes in their own state. These state laws would only be [[trigger law|triggered]] once the compact included enough states to control a majority of the electoral college (270 votes), thus guaranteeing that the national popular vote winner would also win the electoral college.

The academic plan uses two constitutional features:

* [[Article Two of the United States Constitution#Clause 2: Method of choosing electors|Presidential Electors Clause]] in Article 2, section 1, clause 2 which gives each state the power to determine the manner in which its electors are selected.
* [[Compact Clause]], Article I, section 10, clause 3 under which it creates an enforceable compact.

The Amar brothers noted that such a plan could be enacted by the passage of laws in as few as eleven states and would probably not require Congressional approval, though this is not certain (see [[#Debate|Debate]] below).

===Organization and advocacy===
In 2006, [[John Koza]], a computer science professor at Stanford, was the lead author of [[Every Vote Equal]], a book that makes a detailed case for his plan for an interstate compact to establish National Popular Vote.<ref name = "Hertzberg2">{{cite news |url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/03/06/060306ta_talk_hertzberg |title=Count 'Em |work=New Yorker |date=2006-03-06 |accessdate=2011-06-21}}</ref> (Koza had previously had exposure to interstate compacts from his work with state lottery commissions after inventing the [[Scratchcard|scratch-off lottery ticket]]).) That year, Koza, Barry Fadem and others formed [[National Popular Vote Inc.|National Popular Vote]], a non-profit group to promote the legislation. The group has a transpartisan advisory committee including former US Senators [[Jake Garn]], [[Birch Bayh]], and [[David Durenberger]], and former Representatives [[John B. Anderson|John Anderson]], [[John Hall Buchanan, Jr.|John Buchanan]], and [[Tom Campbell (California politician)|Tom Campbell]].

By the time of the group's opening news conference in February 2006, the proposed interstate compact had been introduced in the Illinois legislature. With backing from National Popular Vote, the NPVIC legislation was introduced in five additional state legislatures in the 2006 session. It passed in the Colorado Senate and in both houses of the [[California]] legislature before being vetoed by Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]].

Two measures titled "Presidential Electors. Allocation by National Popular Vote. Interstate Agreement. Statute" were filed as [[California ballot proposition]]s, but failed to get on the ballot.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/elections_j.htm|title=California Initiative Update |publisher=California Secretary of State |accessdate=2007-12-19}}</ref>  These attempted ballot propositions were obviated by the legislative passage of the NPVIC in California in August 2011.

===State-by-state legislative history and status ===

The table below lists significant attempts at enacting a national popular vote bill<U+2014>specifically, those attempts that resulted in a floor vote in at least one legislative house, or that are pending in a state's current legislative session. Bills which failed without receiving a floor vote are not listed. The "EVs" column indicates the ''current'' number of electoral votes a state has. This number may have changed since a bill's introduction due to [[United States congressional apportionment|reapportionment]] following the [[2010 United States Census|2010 Census]].
