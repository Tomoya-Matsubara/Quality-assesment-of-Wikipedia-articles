'''Vladko Ma<U+010D>ek''' ([[June 20]], [[1879]] &ndash; [[May 15]], [[1964]]) was a [[Croatia]]n politician from the first half of the [[20th century]]. He led the [[Croatian Peasant Party]] (HSS) after [[Stjepan Radi<U+0107>]] and through [[World War II]].

== Early life ==
Ma<U+010D>ek was born in village of Kupinec near [[Jastrebarsko]], southwest of [[Zagreb]]. In 1903 he earned a law degree at [[University of Zagreb]]. After clerking at various Croatian courts he opened private law practice in 1908 in [[Sv. Ivan Zelina]]. 

Ma<U+010D>ek joined [[Croatian Peasant Party]] since its founding. After [[World War I]], during which he had served in [[Austro-Hungarian Army]], he became close associate of Stjepan Radi<U+0107>. In 1925, after Radi<U+0107>'s visit to [[Moscow]] and Croatian Peasant Party joining [[Peasants International]], he was arrested by [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Royal Yugoslav]] authorities. While in jail, he was elected to the National Assembly. A few months later HSS joined the government, paving the way for Ma<U+010D>ek to be released.

== HSS leadership and Banate of Croatia ==
Ma<U+010D>ek became the leader of party following Radi<U+0107>'s assassination. He quickly became one of the main opponents of [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|King Alexander]] and his dictatorship. For that he was again arrested in [[1933]] and released following Alexander's assassination in [[1934]]. His stated aim during that period was to transform Yugoslavia from unitary state, dominated by ethnic Serbs, into new form of state organization in which Croatia would have its statehood, lost in [[1918]], restored. Ma<U+010D>ek's ideas appealed to large numbers of Croats and Croatian Peasant Party gradually gained supporters among all classes and followers of all ideologies. Ma<U+010D>ek also nurtured close relations with other opposition parties in Yugoslavia and although his coalition lost elections in [[1938]], it remained the force to be reckoned with.

Ma<U+010D>ek's persistence and political skills finally paid off in August [[1939]] with [[Dragi<U+0161>a Cvetkovi<U+0107>]] in the [[Cvetkovi<U+0107>-Ma<U+010D>ek Agreement]] and creation of Banate ([[Banovina]]) of Croatia, a semi-autonomous entity which contained Croatia and large sections of today's [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. HSS became part of the coalition government while Ma<U+010D>ek himself became deputy prime minister of Yugoslavia. 

== World War II ==
This triumph proved to be short-lived, because Banovina collapsed together with Yugoslavia following [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invasion in April]] [[1941]]. Seen by [[Germany]] as an ideal leader of a new Axis puppet - the [[Independent State of Croatia]] - Ma<U+010D>ek was offered the opportunity to become prime minister of new state, but he refused the offer twice - being one of the few Croatian (and European) politicians at the time to believe that the Axis would ultimately lose the war. Instead, his main aim was to preserve Croatian people from war and unnecessary suffering. He called supporters of HSS to respect and co-operate with the new regime of [[Ante Paveli<U+0107>]], while at the same time he delegated [[Juraj Krnjevi<U+0107>]] to represent Croatian people in Yugoslav government-in-exile. 

Ma<U+010D>ek's strategy proved to be detrimental for his party and himself. In October 1941 he was arrested and put in [[Jasenovac concentration camp]]. A few months later he was put into house arrest at his home in Kupinac. In the meantime, HSS began to fracture itself on ideological lines - some of its members joined [[Ustasha]]s while other joined Tito's [[Partisans (Yugoslavia)|Partisans]]. Although bitterly opposed to the former, he was equally distrustful to the latter and in 1945 he emigrated, first to [[France]], than to [[USA]].

== Later life ==
Still respected in exile, he was offered to lead the numerous Croatian emigration, but he refused.

He died in [[Washington D.C.]] His remains were brought to [[Croatia]] in [[1996]] and buried at the [[Mirogoj]] cemetery in [[Zagreb]].

Vladko Ma<U+010D>ek is arguably one of the most ignored historical figures in modern Croatia, which could be attributed to his policies and legacy not fitting into two dominant ideological patterns of Croatia in second half of 20th Century. After the war, victorious [[Croatian Communist Party|Communists]] treated him as a reactionary. After Croatian independence and the [[Yugoslav wars]], radical Croatian nationalists didn't have much understanding for his peaceful approach in fighting for Croatian interests.
