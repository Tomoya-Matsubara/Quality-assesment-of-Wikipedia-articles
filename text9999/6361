The majority of [[Armenians]] follow [[Christianity]], which has existed in [[Armenia]] for over 1,700 years. Armenia has its own church, the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]], which most Armenians follow. Christianity has a strong influence in the country, but there is a small presence of other religions too.

==Christianity==
===Armenian Apostolics (Orthodox)===
{{main|Armenian Apostolic Church}}
The dominant religion in Armenia is [[Christianity]], with 94.7% of the population following the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]].<ref>[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/am.html CIA Factbook]</ref> 

Christianity was first introduced by the [[apostles]] [[Bartholomew]] and [[Saint Jude|Thaddeus]] in the first century AD. Armenia became the first country to establish Christianity as its state [[religion]] when, in an event traditionally dated to 301 A.D, [[St. Gregory the Illuminator]] convinced [[Tiridates III]], the [[Monarch|king]] of Armenia, to [[convert]] to Christianity. Before this, the dominant religion was [[Zoroastrianism]] and to a smaller degree [[paganism]].

===Armenian Catholics===
{{main|Roman Catholicism in Armenia}}
Smaller groups belong to the [[Armenian Catholic Church]] (an [[Eastern Catholic]] church in full communion with Rome).

===Armenian Evangelicals===
There are also small communities of [[Protestant]] Armenians of various denominations, as [[missionaries]] converted a number of Armenians.

===Other denominations and sects===
The [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] have a presence as well.  [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] claims over 2,000 adherents in Armenia at the end of 2005 (lds.org website).

==Paganism==
Still in Armenia are pagans who are in most of times followers of [[Zoroastrianism]]`s doctrine . Same time Armenians have their own pantheon of Gods. Now the pagans in Armenia are around 3000. 
 
==Judaism==
{{main|History of the Jews in Armenia}}
[[Jews]] have a historic presence in Armenia.  During the [[Soviet]] years, Armenia was considered to be one of the most tolerant republics for Jews in the Soviet Union. Currently there are an estimated 750 Jews in the country, a remnant of a once larger community.  Most left Armenia for [[Israel]] after the collapse of the Soviet Union because of inadequate services.  Still, despite the small numbers, a high intermarriage rate and relative isolation, a lot of enthusiasm exists to help the community meet its needs. <ref>[http://www.ncsj.org/Armenia.shtml Advocates on Behalf of Jews in Russia, Ukraine, the Baltic States, and Eurasia: Armenia and Jews]</ref>

==Islam==
{{main|Islam in Armenia}}
[[Azeris]] and [[Kurds]] living in Armenia traditionally practiced [[Islam]], but most Azeris have fled the country due to the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]]. Approximately 1,000 Muslims live in [[Yerevan]], and one 18th century Mosque remains open for Friday prayers.Islam in Armenia consists mostly of Azeris and Muslim Kurds. In 2009, the Pew Research Center estimated that less than 0.1% of the population, or about 1,000 people, were Muslims.[1]

Armenians did not convert to Islam in large numbers. During the Arabic conquest, Islam came to the Armenians however, almost all Armenians never converted to Islam, since Christians were not required to convert by Muslim law, and the absence of heavy taxation also hindered this. The story was similar in the Ottoman Empire.

During 1988-1991 the overwhelming majority of Muslim population consisting of Azeris and Muslim Kurds fled the country as a result of the Nagorno-Karabakh War and the ongoing conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan. There is also a significant community of Yazidi Kurds (50-70,000 people), who were not affected by this conflict. Since the early 1990s, Armenia has also attracted diverse esoteric and sectarian groups. [2]

==Yazidism==
{{main|Yazidis in Armenia}}

About 2% of Armenia's population, mostly ethnic [[Kurds]] living in the western part of the country, follow the ancient [[Yazidi]] religion. Many Yazidis came to Armenia and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries to escape religious persecution.

==Freedom of religion==
{{main|Freedom of religion in Armenia}}

The Constitution as amended in December 2005 provides for freedom of religion; however, the law places some restrictions on the religious freedom of adherents of minority religious groups, and there were some restrictions in practice. The Armenian (Apostolic) Church, which has formal legal status as the national church, enjoys some privileges not available to other religious groups. 

Some religious denominations reported occasional discrimination by mid- or low-level government officials but found high-level officials to be tolerant. Jehovah's Witnesses reported that judges sentenced them to longer prison terms for evasion of alternative military service than in the past, although the sentences were still within the range allowed by law. Societal attitudes toward some minority religious groups were ambivalent, and there were reports of societal discrimination directed against members of these groups.
