'''James Robert Wallace, Baron Wallace of Tankerness''' [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|PC]] [[Queen's Counsel|QC]] (born 25 August 1954) is a Scottish [[politics|politician]], currently a [[life peer]] in the [[House of Lords]].  He was formerly Leader of the Scottish [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]], [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Orkney and Shetland (UK Parliament constituency)|Orkney and Shetland]], [[Member of the Scottish Parliament]] for [[Orkney (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Orkney]] and the first [[Deputy First Minister of Scotland|Deputy First Minister]] of Scotland in the [[Scottish Executive]].

==Early life==
Wallace was born in [[Annan, Dumfries and Galloway]] and grew up there.  As a boy, his first interest in [[politics]] was stoked when he collected autographs from politicians visiting the local area<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/2840339.stm BBC NEWS | Scotland | CV: Jim Wallace<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>: he still possesses one from [[Tam Dalyell]], with whom he would later serve in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]].  After finishing school in Annan he was accepted by [[Downing College, Cambridge]], where he obtained a joint degree in [[Economics]] and [[Law]]. From there he returned to Scotland to read Law at [[Edinburgh University|Edinburgh]], graduating in 1977.  Based in Edinburgh, he practised as an [[advocate]] at the Scottish Bar, mostly in civil law cases.

==Member of Parliament==
Wallace joined the then-[[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] in the early 1970s, but first became seriously involved after completing his second degree.  His first foray as a candidate was in the [[constituency]] of [[Dumfriesshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Dumfriesshire]] in 1979, where he failed to win.  He also stood, unsuccessfully, as the Liberal candidate in the South of Scotland constituency in the [[European Parliament]] elections of that year.  Four years later, he would earn the Liberal nomination for the seat of [[Orkney and Shetland (UK Parliament constituency)|Orkney and Shetland]], the seat being vacated by former party leader [[Jo Grimond]], and won election to the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|UK Parliament]].  At the time, it was extremely rare for Liberal candidates successfully to win election to succeed former Liberal MPs, although many have since done so.  He was to serve as the MP there for 18 years, occupying a number of front-bench posts for the Liberal Party (and, from 1988 onwards, the [[Liberal Democrats]]), including Employment spokesman and Chief Whip.

In 1992, he was unopposed in becoming the new leader of the [[Scottish Liberal Democrats]], succeeding [[Malcolm Bruce]].  Scottish politics at this time was dominated by the question of constitutional reform.  There were few opportunities for legislation affecting Scots Law to be debated or effectively scrutinised at Westminster and, especially after the [[1987 UK general election|1987 election]], with only ten [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MPs in Scotland but with a large majority in the House of Commons, it was argued that there was a democratic deficit in Scotland.  The Scottish Liberal Democrats were committed to an overarching principle of [[Federation|federalism]] throughout the United Kingdom, with the [[Scottish Labour Party]] advocating legislative devolution for Scotland and Wales, as had been attempted unsuccessfully in the late 1970s, the [[Scottish National Party]] seeking [[independence]].  However, the UK [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] Government wanted no such change, and [[Secretary of State for Scotland|Scottish Secretaries]], such as [[Ian Lang]] and [[Michael Forsyth]], advocated internal parliamentary reforms at Westminster, such as holding more debates in the [[Scottish Grand Committee]], which then consisted of all 72 MPs for Scottish constituencies.  

Given the similarity of their preferred options, the Scottish Liberal Democrats had co-operated with the [[Scottish Labour Party]] in the [[Scottish Constitutional Convention]] to produce a blueprint for a devolved parliament within the UK.  Wallace continued this and the Convention's final proposals were published on [[St Andrew's Day]] 1995.  A key part of this plan was the decision that this new parliament would be elected by a system of [[proportional representation]] (PR). This was a long-held Liberal Democrat (and Liberal) policy which would ensure a fairer distribution of seats, and which would almost certainly deny any single party an overall majority. The Labour Party was initially strongly opposed to this policy, and it was a mark of success for Wallace and the Liberal Democrats that it was agreed.  Both parties agreed to work to enact the proposals, especially after the next UK election.  

When the Conservatives lost the 1997 election, the [[New Labour]] government converted the Constitutional Convention's proposals into a [[White Paper]] and a referendum of the Scottish people was held on 11 September 1997.  Wallace was a key figure in that campaign, arguing strongly for the proposal (alongside Labour and [[Scottish National Party]] leaders), although campaigning in the referendum was suspended for several days following the death of [[Princess Diana]].  Despite Conservative opposition, the plan was approved by nearly 75% of those voting, and nearly 64% also voted separately for the Parliament to have the power to vary the basic rate of income tax.  The [[Scotland Bill]] was then successfully piloted through Westminster and became the founding legislation of the new Parliament.  

He led the Scottish Liberal Democrats in the first election to the new Scottish Parliament in 1999, himself winning the constituency of Orkney with 67% of the votes cast. This meant he served as a Member of both the Scottish and Westminster Parliaments for a time with a [[dual mandate]], although like other MPs elected to Holyrood (such as [[John Swinney]], [[John Home Robertson]] and [[Donald Gorrie]]) he stood down from Westminster at the 2001 General Election.

===Scottish Parliament===
As expected, the proportional election system for the new Scottish Parliament meant that [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] failed to gain an outright [[majority]] in the first elections.  Their Leader, [[Donald Dewar]], chose to seek a formal [[coalition]] government with a working majority rather than try to operate as a [[minority government]].  He contacted Wallace and a week of formal negotiations were held between the two parties' representatives, following which a partnership agreement was signed, committing both parties to support a negotiated joint agenda.  Wallace became Deputy First Minister and Minister for Justice, and maintained these briefs throughout the first term of the Parliament. 

The decision to enter a coalition government with Labour was hugely controversial at the time.  British politicians were entirely unaccustomed to coalition politics, and the Liberal Democrats came under fire from Conservative and SNP opponents who claimed they had 'sold out' their principles.  Key to this criticism was the Labour policy of making students pay tuition fees, which the Liberal Democrats had promised to abolish as their price of entering a coalition, but which in fact became merely the subject of an inquiry as the coalition was formed.  In the event the Liberal Democrats did insist on the abolition of tuition fees after the inquiry reported in 2001, but in 1999 the delay was perceived to have been a compromise and Wallace in particular became the focal point for extremely bitter criticism.  

Despite this, and a number of other difficult moments, he and his party stayed firm and remained in power. Wallace established himself as a competent, if perhaps uninspired Minister.  His legal training, political nous and capacity for hard work saw him demonstrate that Liberal Democrats could govern.  On three occasions over the first term of the Parliament, he became Acting First Minister, twice in 2000 due to at first the illness, and later the tragic death, of the first First Minister [[Donald Dewar]], and then again in 2001 after the resignation of Dewar's successor as [[First Minister]], [[Henry McLeish]]. Each occasion lasted for only a few weeks or months.

Under his continued leadership, the Scottish Liberal Democrats' popularity grew steadily.  After leading the party through the second Holyrood elections in [[Scottish parliamentary election, 2003|2003 elections]], again winning 17 MSPs but with a higher share of the vote, he led the party into a second coalition with Labour.  The 2003 coalition negotiation process was widely seen as a more successful enterprise by the Liberal Democrats than the preceding one, with key aspects of Labour's proposals on [[anti-social behaviour]] dropped or limited, and with the promise of [[proportional representation]] for Scotland's 32 local councils.  Wallace remained as Deputy First Minister but left the Justice brief, becoming instead the Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning.

===Resignation, Retirement and Peerage===
On 9 May 2005, following the [[2005 UK general election]], Wallace surprised many by announcing his intention to stand down as party leader and Deputy First Minister.  He would remain as MSP for Orkney until the 2007 election, but would serve his time out as a [[backbencher]].  He ceased to be an MSP with the dissolution of the Scottish Parliament on 2 April 2007.

On 13 September 2007 it was announced that he was to be appointed to the [[House of Lords]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/north_east/6993788.stm BBC NEWS | Scotland | North East/N Isles | Former Lib Dem leader made a peer<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>.  This was gazetted as '''Baron Wallace of Tankerness''', of [[Tankerness]] in [[Orkney]] on 17 October 2007.

On 28 April 2008 it was announced that Wallace would be a member of the [[Commission on Scottish Devolution]], chaired by Sir [[Kenneth Calman]], established by the Scottish Parliament to consider the future powers of the Parliament, including powers over finance.  This is a distinct exercise from the SNP Government's [[national conversation]].

In November 2008 Wallace received a lifetime achievement award in the Scottish Politician of the Year Awards.<ref>[http://www.theherald.co.uk/politics/otherpolitics/display.var.2467947.0.Lord_Wallaces_lifetime_of_achievement_rewarded.php Lord Wallace's Lifetime of Achievement<!-- Bot generated title -->], The Herald, Friday 14/11/2008</ref>

==Personal life==
===Affiliation with the Church of Scotland===
Wallace is also an [[Ministers and elders in the Church of Scotland|elder]] of the [[Church of Scotland]], attending [[St. Magnus' Cathedral, Kirkwall|St Magnus Cathedral]] in Kirkwall, Orkney.
