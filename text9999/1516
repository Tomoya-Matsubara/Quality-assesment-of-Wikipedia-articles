"'''Trust No 1'''" is the sixth episode of the [[The X-Files (season 9)|ninth season]] of the [[Television in the United States|American]] [[science fiction on television|science fiction]] television series ''[[The X-Files]]''. It premiered on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] on {{nowrap|January 6, 2002}}. The episode was written by series creator [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] and executive producer [[Frank Spotnitz]], and directed by [[Tony Wharmby]]. "Trust No 1" helps to explore the series' overarching [[Mythology of The X-Files|mythology]]. The episode received a [[Nielsen rating|Nielsen household rating]] of 5.1 and was viewed by 5.4 million households; it garnered mixed to negative reviews from television critics, with many feeling that it portrayed the series' characters in a way that was unfaithful to the show's history.

The show centers on [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] special agents [[John Doggett]] ([[Robert Patrick]]), [[Monica Reyes]] ([[Annabeth Gish]]), and [[Dana Scully]] ([[Gillian Anderson]]) who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called [[X-File]]s. In this episode, Scully is hopeful about reuniting with her former partner, [[Fox Mulder]] ([[David Duchovny]]) when a complete stranger offers new information about what drove him into hiding. Yet her trust in the stranger may place Mulder in even more danger.

"Trust No 1" features former leading star Duchovny via the use of previously filmed footage. It was written in response to fans who felt that, during [[The X-Files (season 8)|season eight]], Mulder's abduction was not dealt with until his miraculous return in "[[This is Not Happening]]"/"[[DeadAlive]]". Actor [[Terry O'Quinn]], who appears in this episode as the Shadow Man, had appeared as different characters in the [[The X-Files (season 2)|second season]] episode "[[Aubrey (The X-Files)|Aubrey]]" and the 1998 [[The X-Files (film)|feature film]]. The tagline for the episode is "They're Watching."

==Plot==
[[Dana Scully]] ([[Gillian Anderson]]) is approached by a couple, whose infant apparently shows the same strange abilities as William. The father, an NSA agent, discovered that their infant was part of the government's super soldier project and begs her to call [[Fox Mulder]] ([[David Duchovny]]) out of hiding in order to give him this information. [[John Doggett]] ([[Robert Patrick]]) and [[Monica Reyes]] ([[Annabeth Gish]]) confirm that the couple's story matches with what is known about the super soldiers. Initially, Doggett encourages Scully to contact Mulder. Scully, fearful for Mulder's safety, though desperately missing him, lies and says that she does not know where he went or how to contact him. All the while, she absently touches a printout of an email that Mulder sent her earlier.

Later Scully is approached by another man ([[Terry O'Quinn]]) who has been watching her for quite some time, going so far as to detail the first night Scully and Mulder had sex, and tells her that he has files detailing the names of the super soldiers that he will only give to Mulder. He tells her she only has one day to contact him before he disappears forever. Scully finally gives in and contacts Mulder, the temptation to see him again being far too much; she tells Doggett that she and Mulder had worked out a system that, if Mulder was to return, he would be arriving by train. Reyes, Doggett, and the NSA agent cover Scully at the train station. As the train pulls up, the NSA agent pulls a gun and aims it at Scully. Reyes sees this and knocks Scully down, but the agent keeps pointing his gun. The Shadow Man, the man that had contacted Scully earlier, appears with a gun drawn. He shoots the NSA agent and approaches Scully. Before he can kill her, Doggett appears and shoots him twice, sending him falling onto the train tracks where the train passes over him moments later.

Train security orders the train to keep going, and while Scully consoles the NSA agent's wife, Doggett returns and says that he ca not find the other man's body. Scully, fearful that the man was a super soldier pursuing Mulder, chases after the train with Doggett and Reyes. They get a call saying that someone jumped off a train and into a rock quarry. Doggett and Reyes chase after someone they believe to be Mulder, while Scully goes deeper into the quarry. She is attacked by the super soldier. Suddenly, the soldier is attracted to the red rocks being mined there<U+2014>[[Magnetite]]<U+2014>and is subsequently destroyed.<ref>{{cite web|title=Trust No 1|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/xfiles/episodeguide/nine/page10.shtml|work=BBC Cult|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=14 July 2012}}</ref>

The episode received mixed to negative reviews from television critics.

He wrote, "Overall, this is not nearly as bad an episode as many people are making it out to be, but it<U+2019>s not exactly a sterling piece of work, either. It feels like they were shooting for a '[[Memento Mori (The X-Files)|Momento Mori]]' {{sic}}, and wound up with a '[[Zero Sum (The X-Files)|Zero Sum]]'. This episode is interesting in the information it provides, and not much else. But in my opinion, it<U+2019>s better than '[[Lord of the Flies (The X-Files)|Lord of the Flies]]'."<ref>{{cite web|last=Keegan|first=John|title=Trustno1|url=http://www.entil2001.com/series/x-files/reviews/season9/9-6.html|publisher=Critical Myth|accessdate=14 July 2012}}</ref>

[[Robert Shearman]] and [[Lars Pearson]], in their book ''Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen'', rated the episode one star out of five. The two called the entry "an exercise in futility [<U+2026>] at best" and argued that, because Duchovny had left the series, the sense of excitement that he might have made an appearance in the episode was completely gone. Furthermore, Shearman and Pearson heavily criticized Mulder and Scully's characterization, calling Mulder a character the audience "can't recognize any more" and Scully a "gullible patsy".<ref name=shear>Shearman and Pearson, pp. 264<U+2013>265</ref> Tom Kessenich, in his book ''Examinations'', wrote a largely negative review of the episode. He derided the series for making it appear that Mulder abandoned the woman he loved and his own child. He noted, "Just because it walks, talks, and sometimes acts like ''The X-Files'', doesn't make it ''The X-Files''."<ref>Kessenich, pp. 195<U+2013>200</ref>
