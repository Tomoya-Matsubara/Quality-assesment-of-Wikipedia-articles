The '''''Biuro Szyfr<U+00F3>w''''' ({{IPAudio|Biuro szyfr<U+00F3>w.ogg|[<U+02C8>bjur<U+0254> <U+02C8><U+0283><U+0268>fruf]}}; [[Polish language|Polish]] for "'''Cipher Bureau'''") was the [[interwar]] [[Polish General Staff]]'s agency charged with both [[cryptography]] (the ''use'' of [[cipher]]s and [[code]]s) and [[Cryptography#Terminology|cryptology]] (the study of ciphers and codes, particularly for the purpose of "''breaking''" them). 

The precursor of the agency that would become the Cipher Bureau was created in May 1919, during the [[Polish-Soviet War]] (1919<U+2013>21), and played a vital role in securing Poland's survival in that war. 

In mid-1931, the Cipher Bureau was formed by the merger of pre-existing agencies. In December 1932, the Bureau began breaking [[Germany]]'s [[Enigma machine|Enigma]] [[cipher]]s. Over the next seven years, Polish cryptologists overcame the growing structural and operating complexities of the [[plugboard]]-equipped Enigma. The Bureau also broke [[Soviet]] cryptography.

Five weeks before the outbreak of [[World War II]], on 25 July 1939, in [[Warsaw]], the Polish Cipher Bureau revealed its Enigma-decryption techniques and equipment to representatives of French and British [[military intelligence]], which had been unable to make any headway against Enigma. This Polish intelligence-and-technology transfer would give the [[Allies in World War II|Allies]] an unprecedented advantage ([[Ultra]]) in their ultimately victorious prosecution of [[World War II]].

{{main|Polish-Soviet War}}

On 8 May 1919, a [[Polish Army]] "Cipher Section" (''Sekcja Szyfr<U+00F3>w''), precursor to the "Cipher Bureau" (''Biuro Szyfr<U+00F3>w''), was created by Lt. [[J<U+00F3>zef Serafin Stanslicki]].<ref>Jan Bury, 2004.</ref> The Cipher Section reported to the [[Polish General Staff]] and contributed substantially to Poland's defense by [[J<U+00F3>zef Pi<U+0142>sudski]]'s forces during the [[Polish-Soviet War]] of 1919<U+2013>21, thereby helping preserve Poland's independence, recently regained in the wake of [[World War I]].<ref>[[Richard Woytak]], "Colonel [[Jan Kowalewski|Kowalewski]] and the Origins of Polish Code Breaking and Communication Interception," ''East European Quarterly'', vol. XXI, no. 4 (January 1988), pp. 497<U+2013>500.</ref>  

The ''Cipher'' Section's purview included both [[cipher]]s and [[code (cryptography)|code]]s.  In loose [[Polish language|Polish]] parlance, the term "cipher" ("''szyfr''") refers to ''both'' these two principal categories of [[cryptography]].  (The opposite is the practice in [[English language|English]], which loosely refers to ''both'' [[code]]s and [[cipher]]s as "codes.")

During the Polish-Soviet War, some one hundred Russian ciphers were broken by a sizable cadre of Polish cryptologists who included Army Lt. [[Jan Kowalewski]] and three world-famous professors of mathematics <U+2014> [[Stefan Mazurkiewicz]], [[Wac<U+0142>aw Sierpi<U+0144>ski]] and [[Stanis<U+0142>aw Le<U+015B>niewski]].<ref>Grzegorz Nowik, ''Zanim z<U+0142>amano Enigm<U+0119>:  Polski radiowywiad podczas wojny z bolszewick<U+0105> Rosj<U+0105>, 1918<U+2013>1920'' (Before Enigma Was Broken:  Polish Radio Intelligence during the War with Bolshevik Russia, 1918<U+2013>1920), 2004, pp. 25<U+2013>26.</ref>

Russian army staffs were still following the same disastrously ill-disciplined signals-security procedures as had [[Tsarist]] army staffs during [[World War I]], to the decisive advantage of their German enemy.  As a result, during the Polish-Soviet War the Polish military were regularly kept informed by Russian signals stations about the movements of Russian armies and their intentions and operational orders.  The Russian staffs, according to Polish Colonel Mieczys<U+0142>aw <U+015A>cie<U+017C>y<U+0144>ski, "had not the slightest hesitation about sending any and all messages of an operational nature by means of radiotelegraphy; there were periods during the war when, for purposes of operational communications and for purposes of command by higher staffs, no other means of communication whatever were used, messages being transmitted either entirely ["in clear," or [[plaintext]]] or encrypted by means of such an incredibly uncomplicated system that for our trained specialists reading the messages was child's play.  The same held for the chitchat of personnel at radiotelegraphic stations, where discipline was disastrously lax."<ref>Mieczys<U+0142>aw <U+015A>cie<U+017C>y<U+0144>ski, ''Radjotelegrafja jako <U+017A>r<U+00F3>d<U+0142>o wiadomo<U+015B>ci o nieprzyjacielu'' (Radiotelegraphy as a Source of Intelligence on the Enemy), 1928, pp. 16<U+2013>17.</ref>  

In the crucial month of August 1920 alone, Polish cryptologists [[decryption|decrypted]] 410 signals:  from Soviet General [[Mikhail Tukhachevsky]], commander of the northern front; from [[Leon Trotsky]], Soviet commissar of war; from commanders of armies, e.g. the commander of the IV Army, Sergieyev; the commander of the Horse Army, [[Semyon Budionny]]; the commander of the 3 Cavalry Corps, Gaya; from the staffs of the XII, XV and XVI Armies; from the staffs of the [[Mozyr]] Group [named after the [[Belarus]]sian city]; the [[Zolochiv]] Group [after the [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] town]; the Yakir Group [after General [[Iona Emmanuilovich Yakir]]]; from the 2, 4, 7, 10, 11, 12, 16, 17, 18, 24, 27, 41, 44, 45, 53, 54, 58 and 60 Infantry Divisions; from the 8 Cavalry Division, etc.<ref><U+015A>cie<U+017C>y<U+0144>ski, p. 19.</ref>

The intercepts were as a rule [[decryption|decrypted]] the same day, at latest the next day, and were immediately sent to the Polish [[General Staff]]'s Section II (Intelligence) and operational section.  The more important signals were read in their entirety by the Chief of the General Staff, and even by the [[Commander in Chief]], Marshal [[J<U+00F3>zef Pi<U+0142>sudski]].<ref><U+015A>cie<U+017C>y<U+0144>ski, pp. 19<U+2013>20.</ref>

Interception and reading of the signals provided Polish intelligence with entire Russian operational orders.  The Poles were able to follow the whole operation of [[Budionny]]'s Horse Army in the second half of August 1920 with incredible precision, just by monitoring his radiotelegraphic correspondence with [[Tukhachevsky]], including the famous and historic conflict between the two Russian commanders.<ref><U+015A>cie<U+017C>y<U+0144>ski, p. 25.</ref>  

The intercepts even included an order from [[Trotsky]] to the revolutionary council of war of the Western Front, confirming Tukhachevsky's operational orders, thus giving them the authority of the supreme chief of the Soviet armed forces.<ref><U+015A>cie<U+017C>y<U+0144>ski, pp. 25<U+2013>26.</ref>  

An entire operational order from Tukhachevsky to Budionny was intercepted on 19 August and read on 20 August, stating the tasks of all of Tukhachevsky's armies, of which only the essence had previously been known.<ref name="<U+015A>cie<U+017C>y<U+0144>ski, p. 26"><U+015A>cie<U+017C>y<U+0144>ski, p. 26.</ref>

<U+015A>cie<U+017C>y<U+0144>ski surmises that the Soviets must likewise have intercepted Polish operational signals; but he doubts that this would have availed them much since Polish cryptography "stood abreast of modern cryptography" and since only a small number of Polish higher headquarters were equipped with [[radio station]]s, of which there was a great shortage; and finally, Polish headquarters were more cautious than the Russians and almost every Polish [[division (military)|division]] had the use of a [[land line]].<ref name="<U+015A>cie<U+017C>y<U+0144>ski, p. 26"/> 

Polish cryptologists enjoyed generous support under the command of Col. [[Tadeusz Schaetzel]], chief of the [[History of Polish Intelligence Services|Polish General Staff's Section II (Intelligence)]].  They worked at [[Warsaw]]'s radio station ''WAR'', one of two Polish long-range radio transmitters at the time. 

The Polish cryptologists' work led, among many other things, to discovery of a large gap on the [[Red Army]]'s left flank, which enabled Poland's Marshal [[J<U+00F3>zef Pi<U+0142>sudski]] to drive a war-winning wedge into that gap during the August 1920 [[Battle of Warsaw (1920)|Battle of Warsaw]].<ref name="Nowik, p. 26">Nowik, p. 26.</ref>

Grzegorz Nowik states that the discovery of the Cipher Bureau's archives, decades after the [[Polish-Soviet War]], has demonstrated {{Blockquote|that... radio intelligence... furnished [the Polish Commander-in-Chief, [[J<U+00F3>zef Pi<U+0142>sudski]]], in the years 1919<U+2013>1920... the most complete and... current intelligence on all aspects of the functioning of the [[Red Army]], especially of units operating on the anti-Polish front, that it was radio intelligence that to a large degree determined the course of all... military operations conducted by Poland in 1920 <U+2014> from the January fighting at [[Ovruch]], through the March operation against [[Mozyr]] and [[Kiev]], the April operation in [[Ukraine]], the battles with [[Tukhachevsky]]'s first and second offensives in [[Belarus]], the battles with [[Budionny]]'s Cavalry Army, the Battle of Brody, to the [[Battle of Warsaw (1920)|Battles of Warsaw]], [[Battle of Lw<U+00F3>w (1920)|Lw<U+00F3>w]] and the [[Battle of the Niemen River|Niemen]].<ref name="Nowik, p. 26"/>|}}

==Cipher Bureau==
In mid-1931, at the Polish [[General Staff]], a Cipher Bureau was formed by merging the Radio-Intelligence Office (''Referat Radiowywiadu'') and the Polish-Cryptography Office (''Referat Szyfr<U+00F3>w W<U+0142>asnych'').<ref>[[W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw Kozaczuk]], 1984 ''Enigma'', p. 23, note 6.</ref> The Bureau was charged with both [[cryptography]] <U+2014> the generation, and supervision of the ''use'', of [[cipher]]s and [[code]]s <U+2014> and [[Cryptography#Terminology|cryptology]], the study of ciphers and codes, particularly for the purpose of "''breaking''" them. 

Between 1932 and 1936, the Cipher Bureau took on additional responsibilities, including radio communications between [[military intelligence|military-intelligence]] posts in Poland and abroad, as well as radio [[counterintelligence]] <U+2014> mobile [[direction finding|direction-finding]] and intercept stations for the locating and [[traffic analysis|traffic-analysis]] of [[espionage|spy]] and [[fifth column|fifth-column]] transmitters operating in Poland.<ref>[[W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw Kozaczuk|Kozaczuk]], 1984 ''Enigma'', p. 23, note 6.</ref>

==Stalking Enigma==
[[File:Palac Saski.jpg|thumb|left|400px|General Staff building ([[Saxon Palace]]). The arcade shelters [[Tomb of the Unknown Soldier]], before which stands [[Bertel Thorvaldsen|Thorvaldsen]]'s [[equestrian statue]] of Prince [[J<U+00F3>zef Poniatowski]].  In this building in 1932 the Cipher Bureau first broke the [[Enigma machine|plugboard military Enigma]].]]
In late 1927 or early 1928, there arrived at the Warsaw Customs Office from Germany a package that, according to the accompanying declaration, was supposed to contain radio equipment.  The German firm's representative strenuously demanded that the package be returned to Germany even before going through customs, as it had been shipped with other equipment by mistake.  His insistent demands alerted the customs officials, who notified the Polish General Staff's Cipher Bureau, which took a keen interest in new developments in radio technology.  And since it happened to be a Saturday afternoon, the Bureau's experts had ample time to look into the matter.  They carefully opened the box and found that it did not, in fact, contain radio equipment but a cipher machine.  They examined the machine minutely, then put it back into the box.<ref>[[Marian Rejewski]], "Appendix D: How the Polish Mathematicians Broke Enigma," in [[W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw Kozaczuk]], 1984 ''Enigma'', p. 246.</ref> 

Rejewski comments that the cipher machine may be surmised to have been a ''commercial''-model Enigma, since at that time the military model had not yet been devised. "Hence this trivial episode was of no practical importance, though it does fix the date at which the Cipher Bureau's  interest in the Enigma machine began"{{ndash}} manifested, initially, in the entirely legal acquisition of a single commercial-model Enigma.<ref name="Kozaczuk p. 246">[[Marian Rejewski]], "Appendix D" in Kozaczuk, 1984 ''Enigma'', p. 246.</ref>  
[[File:MR 1932 small.jpg|thumb|100px|[[Marian Rejewski]], ca. 1932]]
On 15 July 1928 the first German machine-enciphered messages were broadcast by German military radio stations.  Polish monitoring stations began intercepting them, and cryptologists in the Polish Cipher Bureau's German section were instructed to try to read them.  The effort was fruitless, however, and was eventually abandoned.  There remained very slight evidence of the effort, in the form of a few densely written-over sheets of paper and the commercial-model Enigma machine.<ref name="Kozaczuk p. 246"/>
  
On 15 January 1929 Major [[Gwido Langer]], after a tour of duty as chief of staff of the [[Polish 1st Legions Infantry Division|1st Legion Infantry Division]], became chief of the Radio-Intelligence Office, and subsequently of the Cipher Bureau.<ref>Kozaczuk, 1984 ''Enigma'', p. 23, note 6.</ref> The Bureau's deputy chief, and the chief of its German section (''BS-4''), was Captain [[Maksymilian Ci<U+0119><U+017C>ki]].  

In 1929, while the Cipher Bureau's predecessor agency was still headed by Major Franciszek Pokorny (a relative of the outstanding [[World War I]] [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] cryptologist, Captain [[Herman Pokorny]]<ref>[[Marian Rejewski]], "Appendix D" in Kozaczuk, 1984 ''Enigma'', p. 247.</ref>), Ci<U+0119><U+017C>ki, Franciszek Pokorny and a civilian Bureau employee, [[Antoni Palluth]], taught a secret [[cryptology]] course at [[Pozna<U+0144> University]] for selected mathematics students.  Over ten years later, during [[World War II]] while in [[France]], one of the students, [[Marian Rejewski]], would discover that the entire course had been taught from French General Marcel Givi<U+00E8>rge's book, ''Cours de cryptographie'' (Course of Cryptography), published in 1925.<ref>[[Marian Rejewski]], "Appendix B:  A Conversation with Marian Rejewski," in Kozaczuk, 1984 ''Enigma'', p. 230.</ref> 

In September 1932, Maksymilian Ci<U+0119><U+017C>ki hired three young graduates of the Pozna<U+0144> course to be Bureau staff members: [[Marian Rejewski]], [[Jerzy R<U+00F3><U+017C>ycki]] and [[Henryk Zygalski]].<ref>[[Marian Rejewski]], Appendix B to Kozaczuk, 1984 ''Enigma'', p. 231.</ref>

In 1926 the German Navy had adopted, as its top cryptographic device, a modified civilian Enigma machine; in 1928 the German Army had followed suit.<ref>Kozaczuk, 1984 ''Enigma'', p. xiii.</ref> In December 1932, [[Marian Rejewski]] made what historian [[David Kahn (writer)|David Kahn]] describes as one of the greatest advances in cryptologic history, by applying pure [[mathematics]]{{ndash}} [[group theory]]{{ndash}} to breaking the [[Wehrmacht|German armed forces']] [[Enigma machine|Enigma machine ciphers]].<ref>[[David Kahn (writer)|David Kahn]], ''The Codebreakers'', 2nd ed., 1996, p. 974.</ref> Rejewski's solution was greatly <U+2014> possibly critically <U+2014> facilitated by documents that had been made available by Captain [[Gustave Bertrand]] of French military intelligence; the French had obtained them from a traitor working at the German Armed Forces' Cipher Office whom the French code-named ''Asch<U+00E9>'' ([[Hans-Thilo Schmidt]]).<ref>[[Marian Rejewski]], "How the Polish Mathematicians Broke Enigma," Appendix D to Kozaczuk, 1984 ''Enigma'', pp. 258<U+2013>59.</ref>

After Rejewski had reconstructed the military Enigma, the Polish Cipher Bureau commissioned the [[AVA Radio Company]], co-owned by [[Antoni Palluth]], to build "doubles" of the German Enigma to Rejewski's specifications.<ref>Kozaczuk, 1984 ''Enigma'', p. 25.</ref>

AVA subsequently also constructed cryptologic devices such as Rejewski's "[[cyclometer]]" and "[[Bomba (cryptography)|cryptologic bomb]]."<ref>Kozaczuk, 1984 ''Enigma'', pp. 53, 212.</ref> On the other hand, [[Zygalski sheets|perforated "Zygalski sheets"]] were produced at the Cipher Bureau itself.

In January 1938, Colonel [[Stefan Mayer]] directed that statistics be compiled for a two-week period, comparing the numbers of Enigma messages solved, to Enigma intercepts.  The ratio came to 75 percent.  "Nor," [[Marian Rejewski]] has commented, "were those 75 percent&nbsp;... the limit of our possibilities.  With slightly augmented personnel, we might have attained about 90 percent&nbsp;... read.  But a certain amount of cipher material&nbsp;... due to faulty transmission or&nbsp;... reception, or to various other causes, always remains unread&nbsp;..."<ref>[[Marian Rejewski]], "Appendix D" in Kozaczuk, 1984 ''Enigma'', p. 265.</ref>

Information obtained from Enigma decryption seems to have been directed from B.S.-4 principally to the German Office of the General Staff's Section II (Intelligence).  There, from fall 1935 to mid-April 1939, it was worked up by Major [[Jan Le<U+015B>niak]], who in April 1939 would turn the German Office over to another officer and himself form a Situation Office intended for wartime service.  He would head the Situation Office to and through the [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|September 1939 Campaign]].<ref>Kozaczuk, 1984 ''Enigma'', pp. 58, 64<U+2013>66.</ref>

When [[World War II]] broke out on 1 September 1939, Le<U+015B>niak and his colleagues had been working intensively for two or three years to establish the German [[order of battle]] and had succeeded in working out nearly 95 percent of it.  The German attack on Poland  came as no surprise to the [[Polish General Staff]].  The results that had been obtained by [[Polish intelligence]], according to Le<U+015B>niak, had "absolutely exceeded what would normally have been possible."<ref>Kozaczuk, 1984 ''Enigma'', p. 66.</ref>

==Kabaty Woods==
Until 1937 the Cipher Bureau's German section, ''BS-4'', had been housed in the Polish General Staff building <U+2014> the stately 18th-century [[Pa<U+0142>ac Saski|"Saxon Palace"]] <U+2014> in Warsaw. That year BS-4 moved into specially constructed new facilities in the [[Kabaty|Kabaty Woods]] near [[Pyry]], south of Warsaw.  There, working conditions were incomparably better than in the cramped quarters at the General Staff building.<ref>Kozaczuk, 1984 ''Enigma'', p. 43.</ref>

The move was dictated as well by requirements of security.  Germany's ''[[Abwehr]]'' was always looking for potential traitors among the military and civilian workers at the General Staff building. Strolling agents, even if lacking access to the Staff building, could observe personnel entering and leaving, and photograph them with concealed miniature cameras. Annual ''Abwehr'' intelligence assignments for German agents in Warsaw placed a priority on securing informants at the Polish General Staff.<ref>Kozaczuk, 1984 ''Enigma'', p. 43.</ref>

==Gift to allies==
It was at Pyry, on 25 July 1939, with World War II looming only five weeks off, that the Cipher Bureau's chiefs, Lt. Col. [[Gwido Langer]] and Major [[Maksymilian Ci<U+0119><U+017C>ki]], the three civilian mathematician-cryptologists, and Col. [[Stefan Mayer]] (Polish General Staff  [[military intelligence|intelligence]] chief), on General Staff instructions, revealed Poland's Enigma-decryption achievements to intelligence representatives of France (Major [[Gustave Bertrand]], the French radio-intelligence and cryptology chief, and Capt. [[Henri Braqueni<U+00E9>]] of the French Air Force staff) and [[Great Britain|Britain]] (Commander [[Alastair Denniston]], chief of Britain's [[Government Code and Cypher School]]; [[Alfred Dillwyn Knox]], chief British [[cryptology|cryptologist]];<ref>[[Marian Rejewski]], "Appendix B" in Kozaczuk, 1984 ''Enigma'', p. 236.</ref> and Commander Humphrey Sandwith, chief of the [[Royal Navy]]'s intercept and [[direction finding|direction-finding]] stations<ref>Ralph Erskine, "The Poles Reveal Their Secrets:  [[Alastair Denniston]]'s Account of the July 1939 Meeting at [[Pyry]],"  ''[[Cryptologia]]'', vol. 30, no. 4 (2006), pp. 294<U+2013>305.</ref>).

When Rejewski had been working on reconstructing the German military Enigma machine in late 1932, he had ultimately solved a crucial element, the wiring of the letters of the alphabet into the entry drum, with the inspired guess that they might be wired in simple ''alphabetical'' order.  Now, at the trilateral meeting{{ndash}} Rejewski was later to recount{{ndash}} "the first question that&nbsp;... [[Alfred Dillwyn Knox|Dillwyn Knox]] asked was: 'What are the connections in the entry drum?{{'"}}  Knox was mortified to learn how simple the answer was.<ref>[[Marian Rejewski]], Appendix D to Kozaczuk, 1984 ''Enigma'', p. 257.</ref>

The Poles' gift, to their western Allies, of Enigma decryption, five weeks before the outbreak of World War II, came not a moment too soon.  Former [[Bletchley Park]] mathematician-cryptologist [[Gordon Welchman]] has written:  "[[Ultra]] [the British Enigma-decryption operation] would never have gotten off the ground if we had not learned from the Poles, in the nick of time, the details both of the German military&nbsp;... [[Enigma machine]], and of the operating procedures that were in use."<ref>[[Gordon Welchman]], ''The Hut Six Story'', p. 289.</ref>  After the war, Britain's Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] was to tell [[George VI of the United Kingdom|King George VI]]:  "It was thanks to Ultra that we won the war."<ref>Cited in a 2003 [[Imperial War Museum]] exhibit on "Secret War."</ref> Allied Supreme Commander [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], at war's end, described Enigma decryption as having been a "decisive contribution to the Allied war effort."<ref>[[F.W. Winterbotham]], ''The Ultra Secret'', p. 17.</ref>    

Churchill's greatest wartime fear, even after Hitler had suspended [[Operation Sealion]] and [[Operation Barbarossa|invaded the Soviet Union]], was that the German submarine [[wolf pack]]s would succeed in strangling sea-locked Britain.<ref>[[Winston Churchill]], ''Their Finest Hour'', pp. 598<U+2013>600.</ref>  A major factor that averted Britain's defeat in the [[Battle of the Atlantic (1939<U+2013>1945)|Battle of the Atlantic]] was her regained mastery of Naval Enigma decryption; and while the latter benefited crucially from British seizure of German Enigma-equipped naval vessels, the breaking of German naval signals ultimately relied on techniques that had been pioneered by the Polish Cipher Bureau.<ref>[[David Kahn (writer)|David Kahn]], ''Seizing the Enigma'', 1991.</ref>  Had Britain capitulated to Hitler, the [[United States]] would have been deprived of an essential forward base for its subsequent involvement in the [[Europe]]an and [[North Africa]]n theaters. 

A week after the Pyry meeting, [[Dillwyn Knox]], in a letter dated 1 August 1939, thanked the Poles, in Polish, "for your cooperation and patience."  He enclosed little paper batons and a scarf picturing a [[Derby (horse race)|Derby horse race]]{{ndash}} evidently emblematic of the cryptological race that Knox had hoped to win using the batons, and whose loss he was gallantly acknowledging.<ref>Kozaczuk, 1984 ''Enigma'', p. 60.</ref>

On 5 September 1939, as it became clear that Poland was unlikely to halt the ongoing German invasion, BS-4 received orders to destroy part of its files and evacuate essential personnel.<ref>Kozaczuk, 1984 ''Enigma'', p. 70.</ref>

On 17 September, as the [[Soviet Army]] invaded eastern Poland, Cipher Bureau personnel crossed their country's southeastern border, together with other Polish military and government personnel, into [[Romania]].  They eventually made their way to France, where, at "''[[PC Bruno]]''", outside [[Paris]], they continued breaking German Enigma traffic in collaboration with [[Bletchley Park]], fifty miles northwest of [[London]], [[England]]. In the interest of security, the allied cryptological services, before sending their messages over a [[teletype]] line, encrypted them using ''Enigma doubles''.  [[Henri Braqueni<U+00E9>]] often closed messages with an ironic "''[[Heil Hitler]]!''"<ref>Kozaczuk, 1984 ''Enigma'', pp. 70<U+2013>87.</ref>

As late as December 1939, when Lt. Col. [[Gwido Langer]], accompanied by Captain [[Henri Braqueni<U+00E9>|Braqueni<U+00E9>]], visited London and Bletchley Park, the British asked that the Polish cryptologists be turned over to them.

Following the capitulation of France in June 1940, the Poles were evacuated to [[Algeria]], in North Africa.  On October 1, 1940, they resumed work at "''[[Cadix]]''", near [[Uz<U+00E8>s]] in unoccupied southern, [[Vichy France]], under the sponsorship of [[Gustave Bertrand]].<ref>Kozaczuk, 1984 ''Enigma'', pp. 112<U+2013>18.</ref>  

A little over two years later, on 8 November 1942, Bertrand learned from the [[BBC]] that the Allies had landed in [[French North Africa]] ("[[Operation Torch]]"). Knowing that in such an eventuality the Germans planned to occupy [[Vichy France]], on 9 November he evacuated [[Cadix]]. Two days later, on 11 November, the Germans indeed marched into southern France.  On the morning of 12 November they occupied Cadix.<ref>Kozaczuk, 1984 ''Enigma'', p. 139.</ref>

Over the two years since its establishment in October 1940, [[Cadix]] had decrypted thousands of [[Wehrmacht]], [[SS]] and [[Gestapo]] messages, originating not only from French territory but from across Europe, which provided invaluable intelligence to Allied commands and [[Resistance during World War II|resistance movement]]s.<ref>Kozaczuk, 1984 ''Enigma'', pp. 139<U+2013>40.</ref><ref>It is not clear, however, whether, after the June 1940 fall of France, the Cipher Bureau had broken ''Enigma''.  Rejewski, the principal Polish source, wrote in a posthumously published 1980 paper that at [[Cadix]] "We worked on other ciphers, no longer on Enigma." (Kozaczuk, 1984 ''Enigma'', p. 270.)  Colonel [[Stefan Mayer]] of Polish Intelligence, however, mentioned the Poles breaking "interesting [machine-enciphered messages] from [Germany's 1941] [[Balkan]] campaign coming [in over] the 'Luftwaffe' network..." (Kozaczuk, 1984 ''Enigma'', p. 116.)  And French intelligence Gen. [[Gustave Bertrand]] wrote of Enigma having been read at Cadix. (Kozaczuk, 1984 ''Enigma'', p. 117.) Tadeusz Lisicki, Rejewski's and Zygalski's immediate chief in wartime England but sometimes a dubious source, wrote in 1982 that "Rejewski in [a letter] conceded that Bertrand was doubtless right that at Cadix they had read Enigma, and that the number given by Bertrand, of 673 [Wehrmacht] telegrams, was correct.... The British did not send keys to Cadix; these were found using various tricks such as the sillies [and] [[Herivel tip]] described by [[Gordon Welchman|Welchman]], [[Alfred Dillwyn Knox|Knox]]'s method, as well as others that Rejewski no longer remembered." ((Kozaczuk, 1984 ''Enigma'', p. 117.)</ref>  Cadix had also decrypted thousands of [[Soviet]] messages.<ref>Kozaczuk, 1984 ''Enigma'', p. 116.</ref>

Having departed Cadix, the Polish personnel evaded the occupying Italian security police and German [[Gestapo]] and sought to escape France via [[Spain]].<ref>Kozaczuk, 1984 ''Enigma'', pp. 148<U+2013>51.</ref>  [[Jerzy R<U+00F3><U+017C>ycki]], [[Jan Grali<U+0144>ski]] and [[Piotr Smole<U+0144>ski]] had died in the January 1942 sinking, in the [[Mediterranean Sea]], of a French passenger ship, the ''Lamorici<U+00E8>re'', in which they had been returning to southern France from a tour of duty in [[Algeria]].<ref>The ship had, appropriately, been christened after a 19th-century French general, [[Christophe L<U+00E9>on Louis Juchault de Lamorici<U+00E8>re]], who had been involved in France's conquest of [[Algeria]].</ref><ref>Kozaczuk, 1984 ''Enigma'', p. 128.</ref>   

[[Marian Rejewski]] and [[Henryk Zygalski]] hiked over the [[Pyrenees]] with a guide (who robbed them at gunpoint) to the Spanish border, where they were arrested on January 30, 1943.<ref>Kozaczuk, 1984 ''Enigma'', pp. 150-51.</ref>  They were incarcerated by the Spaniards for three months before being released, upon [[Red Cross]] intervention, on 4 May 1943.<ref>Kozaczuk, 1984 ''Enigma'', p. 154.</ref> They then managed, by a circuitous land<U+2013>sea<U+2013>air route, to join the [[Polish Armed Forces]] in [[Great Britain|Britain]],<ref>Kozaczuk, 1984 ''Enigma'', pp. 205<U+2013>7.</ref> where they were inducted into the Polish Army and employed at breaking German ''[[SS]]'' ciphers.<ref>Kozaczuk, 1984 ''Enigma'', pp. 208<U+2013>9.</ref>  

Finally, with the end of the two mathematicians' cryptologic work at the close of World War II, the Cipher Bureau ceased to exist. From nearly its inception in 1931 until war's end in 1945, the Bureau, sometimes incorporated into aggregates under [[cryptonym]]s (''[[PC Bruno]]'', ''[[Cadix]]''), had been essentially the same agency, with most of the same core personnel, carrying out much the same tasks; now it was extinguished. Neither Rejewski nor Zygalski would work again as cryptologists. In late 1946 [[Rejewski]] returned to his family in a devastated and politically altered Poland, to live there another 33 years until his death in February 1980.  [[Henryk Zygalski|Zygalski]] would remain in England until his death in August 1978.<ref>Kozaczuk, 1984 ''Enigma'', p. 224.</ref>

==Secret preserved==

Despite their [[travail]]s, Rejewski and Zygalski had fared better than some of their colleagues. Cadix's Polish military chiefs, [[Gwido Langer|Langer]] and [[Maksymilian Ci<U+0119><U+017C>ki|Ci<U+0119><U+017C>ki]], had also been captured{{mdash}} by the Germans, as they tried to escape from France into Spain on the night of March 10<U+2013>11, 1943{{mdash}} along with three other Poles:  [[Antoni Palluth]], [[Edward Fokczy<U+0144>ski]] and Kazimierz Gaca. The first two became [[prisoners of war]]; the other three were sent as [[slave labor]]ers to Germany, where Palluth and Fokczy<U+0144>ski perished.<ref>Kozaczuk, 1984 ''Enigma'', p. 156.</ref> Despite the varyingly dire circumstances in which they were held, none of them{{mdash}} [[Stefan Mayer]] emphasizes{{mdash}}  betrayed the secret of Enigma's [[decryption]], thus making it possible for the Allies to continue exploiting this vital intelligence resource.<ref>Kozaczuk, 1984 ''Enigma'', p. 220.</ref>

Before the war, [[Antoni Palluth|Palluth]], a lecturer in the 1929 secret [[Pozna<U+0144> University]] [[cryptology]] course, had been co-owner of AVA, which produced equipment for the Cipher Bureau, and knew many details of the decryption technology.  In Warsaw, under German occupation, other Cipher Bureau workers were interrogated by German intelligence commissions, and some AVA workers were approached by German agents, but all kept silent about compromises to Engima.<ref>Kozaczuk, 1984 ''Enigma'', pp. 212<U+2013>16.</ref>

==In popular culture==
In 1967 the Polish military historian [[W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw Kozaczuk]], in his book ''Bitwa o tajemnice'' (The Struggle for Secrets), first revealed that the German Enigma had been broken by Polish cryptologists before World War II. Kozaczuk's disclosure came seven years before [[F.W. Winterbotham]]'s ''The Ultra Secret'' (1974) changed conventional views of the history of the war. 

The 1979 Polish film ''Sekret Enigmy'' (The Enigma Secret) [http://imdb.com/title/tt0079878/] is a generally fair, if superficial, account of the Cipher Bureau's story. Twenty-two years later, the 2001 Hollywood film [[Enigma (2001 film)|''Enigma'']] was criticized for its many historical inaccuracies, including omission of Poland's fundamental work in Enigma [[decryption]].
