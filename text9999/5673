In 1790, [[Manuel Quimper]] of the [[Spanish Navy]] set sail from [[Nootka Sound|Nootka]], a temporary [[Human settlement|settlement]] on [[Vancouver Island]], with orders to explore the newly discovered [[Strait of Juan de Fuca]]. Accompanying Quimper was first-pilot [[Gonzalo Lopez de Haro]], who drew detailed charts during the six-week expedition. Although Quimper's journal of the voyage does not refer to the mountain, one of Haro's manuscript charts includes a sketch of Mount Baker.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/LivingWith/Historical/volcanoes_quimper_1790.html |title=Map of the "Northwest Coast of North America -- Strait of Juan de Fuca" which includes Mount Baker and the Cascade Range |author=Manuel Quimper|year=1790}}</ref><ref name="nps">{{NPS|author=G.A.

The British explorer George Vancouver left England a year later. His mission was to survey the northwest coast of America. Vancouver and his crew reached the Pacific Northwest coast in 1792. While anchored in [[Dungeness Spit|Dungeness Bay]] on the south shore of the Strait of Juan de Fuca, third lieutenant Joseph Baker made an observation of Mount Baker, which Vancouver recorded in his journal:{{cquote|About this time a very high conspicuous craggy mountain&nbsp;... presented itself, towering above the clouds: as low down as they allowed it to be visible it was covered with snow; and south of it, was a long ridge of very rugged snowy mountains, much less elevated, which seemed to stretch to a considerable distance&nbsp;... the high distant land formed, as already observed, like detached islands, amongst which the lofty mountain, discovered in the afternoon by the third lieutenant, and in compliment to him called by me Mount Baker, rose a very conspicuous object&nbsp;... apparently at a very remote distance.<ref name="nps"/>}}
Six years later, the official narrative of this voyage was published, including the first printed reference to the mountain.<ref name="nps"/> By the mid-1850s, Mount Baker was a well-known feature on the horizon to the explorers and fur traders who traveled in the Puget Sound region. [[Isaac I. Stevens]], the first governor of [[Washington Territory]], wrote about Mount Baker in 1853:{{cquote|Mount Baker&nbsp;... is one of the loftiest and most conspicuous peaks of the northern Cascade range; it is nearly as high as Mount Rainier, and like that mountain, its snow-covered pyramid has the form of a sugar-loaf. It is visible from all the water and islands&nbsp;... [in Puget Sound] and from the whole southeastern part of the Gulf of Georgia, and likewise from the eastern division of the Strait of Juan de Fuca.

===First ascent===
Edmund Thomas Coleman, an Englishman who resided in [[Victoria, British Columbia]], Canada and a veteran of the [[Alps]], made the first attempt to ascend the mountain in 1866. He chose a route via the [[Skagit River]], but was forced to turn back when local Native Americans refused him passage.<ref name="USFSClmbHst">{{cite web | title = A Brief History of Mt.

Later that same year, Coleman recruited [[Whatcom County]] settlers Edward Eldridge, John Bennett and John Tennant to aid him in his second attempt to scale the mountain. After approaching via the North Fork of the Nooksack River, the party navigated through what is now known as [[Coleman Glacier (Washington)|Coleman Glacier]] and ascended to within several hundred feet of the summit before turning back in the face of an "overhanging cornice of ice" and threatening weather.<ref name="USFSClmbHst"/> Coleman later returned to the mountain after two years. At 4:00&nbsp;p.m. on August 17, 1868, Coleman, Eldridge, Tennant and two new companions (David Ogilvy and Thomas Stratton) scaled the summit via the Middle Fork Nooksack River, Marmot Ridge, Coleman Glacier, and the north margin of the Roman Wall.<ref name="USFSClmbHst"/>

The most destructive and most frequent events at Mount Baker have been [[lahars]] or debris flows and debris avalanches; many, if not most, of these were not related to magmatic eruptions but may have been induced by magma [[intrusion]], steam eruptions, [[earthquakes]], gravitational instability, or possibly even heavy rainfall.<ref name="Gardner"/><ref name=Scott03/><ref name=mbvrc/>

The pale-colored rocks northeast of the modern volcano mark the site of the ancient (1.15 million years old) [[Kulshan caldera]] that collapsed after an enormous [[volcanic ash|ash]] eruption one million years ago.  Subsequently, eruptions in the Mount Baker area have produced cones and lava flows of [[andesite]], the rock that constitutes much of other Cascade Range volcanoes such as Rainier, [[Mount Adams (Washington)|Adams]], and [[Mount Hood|Hood]]. From about 900,000&nbsp;years ago to the present, numerous andesitic volcanic centers in the area have come and disappeared through glacial erosion. The largest of these cones is the [[Black Buttes]] edifice, active between 500,000 and 300,000 years ago and formerly bigger than today's Mount Baker.<ref name="Scott"/><ref name="Topinka2">{{USGS|author=Lyn Topinka| article = Mount Baker, Washington, Brief Eruptive History | url = http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/Volcanoes/Baker/EruptiveHistory/baker_brief_eruptive_history.html | accessdate = 2008-05-11}}</ref>

====Mazama Park eruptive period: 6,600 years ago====

Approximately 6,600 years ago, a series of discrete events culminated in the largest tephra-producing eruption in post-glacial time at Mount Baker. This is the last episode of undoubted magmatic activity preserved in the geologic record.<ref name=Hildreth03/> First, the largest collapse in the history of the volcano occurred from the Roman Wall and transformed into a [[lahar]] that was over {{convert|300|ft|m}} deep in the upper reaches of the Middle Fork of the [[Nooksack River]]. It was at least {{convert|25|ft|m}} deep {{convert|30|mi|km}} downstream from the volcano.<ref name=Scott03/> At that time the Nooksack River is believed to have drained north into the [[Fraser River]]; it is therefore unlikely that this lahar reached [[Bellingham Bay]]. Next, a small hydrovolcanic eruption occurred at Sherman Crater, triggering a second collapse of the flank just east of the Roman Wall. That collapse also became a lahar that mainly followed the course of the first lahar for at least {{convert|20|mi|km}}, and also spilled into tributaries of the Baker River.

In 1843, explorers reported a widespread layer of newly fallen rock fragments "like a snowfall" and that the forest was "on fire for miles around". It is highly unlikely that these fires were caused by ashfall, however, as charred material is not found with deposits of this fine-grained [[volcanic ash]], which was almost certainly cooled in the atmosphere before falling. Rivers south of the volcano were reportedly clogged with ash, and Native Americans reported that many salmon perished. Reports of flooding on the [[Skagit River]] from the eruption are, however, probably greatly exaggerated.<ref>Scott, K.M. and Tucker, D.S., 2004, Natural dams and floods of legend at Mount Baker volcano-evidence from the stratigraphic record of volcanic activity during the Sherman Crater eruptive period (AD 1843 to present):GSA Abstracts with Programs, v. 36, n. 5, p. 377 [http://www.mbvo.wwu.edu/abstracts/abstractText.php?id=21] retrieved 2009-03-31</ref> A short time later, two collapses of the east side of Sherman Crater produced two lahars, the first and larger of which flowed into the natural Baker Lake, increasing its level by at least {{convert|10|ft|m}}.

====Current research at Mount Baker====

A considerable amount of research has been done at Mount Baker over the past decade, and it is now among the most-studied of the [[Cascade volcanoes]]. Recent and ongoing projects include gravimetric and GPS-based geodetic monitoring, fumarole gas sampling, tephra distribution mapping, new interpretations of the Schriebers Meadow lava flow, and hazards analyses. Mapping of Carmelo and Sherman craters, and interpretations of the eruptive history, continues, as well. The Mount Baker Volcano Research Center<ref name=mbvrc/> maintains an online archive of abstracts of this work, and an extensive references list, as well as photos.
