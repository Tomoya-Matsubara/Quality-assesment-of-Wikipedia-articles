'''''Numb3rs''''' ({{pron-en|<U+02C8>n<U+028C>mb<U+0259>rz}} and labeled '''NUMB3RS''') is an American [[television drama]] which premiered on [[CBS]] on January 23, 2005, and concluded on March 12, 2010. The series was created by [[Nicolas Falacci]] and [[Cheryl Heuton]], and follows [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] [[Special Agent]] [[Don Eppes]] ([[Rob Morrow]]) and his mathematical genius brother, [[Charlie Eppes]] ([[David Krumholtz]]), who helps Don solve crimes for the FBI. Brothers [[Ridley Scott|Ridley]] and [[Tony Scott]] produced ''Numb3rs''; its production companies are the Scott brothers' [[Scott Free Productions]], [[CBS Television Studios]] (originally [[Paramount Television]], and later [[CBS Paramount Television]]).

The show focuses equally on the relationships among Don Eppes, his brother Charlie Eppes, and their father, [[Alan Eppes]] ([[Judd Hirsch]]), and on the brothers' efforts to fight crime, normally in Los Angeles. A typical episode begins with a crime, which is subsequently investigated by a team of FBI agents led by Don and [[Mathematical modeling|mathematically modelled]] by Charlie, with the help of [[Larry Fleinhardt]] ([[Peter MacNicol]]) and [[Amita Ramanujan]] ([[Navi Rawat]]). The insights provided by Charlie's mathematics were always in some way crucial to solving the crime.

The series was the most popular show airing on Friday evenings throughout its first four seasons. Its sixth season premiered September 25, 2009.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/974/974311p1.html |title=Chuck, Terminator, Reaper Lead Endangered TV Show List |accessdate=April 25, 2009 |last=Goldman |first=Eric |date=April 2009 |publisher=IGN}}</ref>

The show revolved around three intersecting groups of characters: the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], mathematicians at CalSci (the fictitious California Institute of Science), and the Eppes family.
* Professor [[Charlie Eppes]] is a mathematics genius who consults for the FBI and [[National Security Agency|NSA]]. He teaches at CalSci. He is portrayed by [[David Krumholtz]].
* [[Don Eppes]], Charlie's older brother, is the lead [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI agent]]. He is portrayed by [[Rob Morrow]].
* Professor [[Larry Fleinhardt]] is a [[theoretical physicist]] and [[cosmologist]] at CalSci. Charlie's former mentor and now best friend, he also consults frequently for the FBI. He is portrayed by [[Peter MacNicol]].
* [[Alan Eppes]] is a former [[Los Angeles|L.A.]] [[Urban planner|City planner]], a widower, and the father of both Charlie and Don Eppes. He is portrayed by [[Judd Hirsch]].
* Professor [[Amita Ramanujan]] is a [[mathematician]] at CalSci and an FBI consultant. She has been dating Charlie Eppes and the couple became officially engaged at the beginning of season six. Charlie was her [[thesis advisor]]. She is portrayed by [[Navi Rawat]].
* [[Megan Reeves]] was an FBI [[behaviorist|behavioral specialist]]. She was involved romantically with Larry Fleinhardt and left the FBI to counsel troubled young women. She was portrayed by [[Diane Farr]].
* [[David Sinclair (Numb3rs)|David Sinclair]] is an FBI [[field agent]] and was recently made Don's second-in-charge and promoted to supervisor. He is portrayed by [[Alimi Ballard]].
* [[Colby Granger]] is an FBI [[field agent]]. Once thought to have betrayed his colleagues, he is now back in their good graces and confidence. He is portrayed by [[Dylan Bruno]].

==Episodes==
{{Main|List of Numb3rs episodes}}

===Season 1===
{{Main|List of Numb3rs episodes (season 1)}}
The first season run of the show aired between January 23, 2005, and May 13, 2005, at 10:00 p.m. on Fridays.

Don and Charlie's father, Alan Eppes, provides emotional support for the pair, while Professor Larry Fleinhardt and doctoral student Amita Ramanujan provide mathematical support and insights to Charlie. Season One was a half-season, producing only 13 episodes. [[Sabrina Lloyd]] played Terry Lake, an agent in this season; she was later replaced by [[Diane Farr]], who played Megan Reeves.

===Season 2===
{{Main|List of Numb3rs episodes (season 2)}}
The second season run of the show aired between September 23, 2005, and May 19, 2006, again at 10:00 p.m. on Fridays. Season Two sees several changes to Don's FBI team: Terry Lake is reassigned to [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] and two new members join Don and David Sinclair: [[Megan Reeves (Numb3rs)|Megan Reeves]] and [[Colby Granger]]. Charlie is challenged on one of his long-standing pieces of mathematical work and also starts work on a new theory, Cognitive Emergence Theory. Larry sells his home and assumes a [[nomad]]ic lifestyle, while he becomes romantically involved with Megan. Amita receives an offer for an assistant professor position at [[Harvard University]], but is plagued by doubt as her relationship with Charlie is challenged and her career is in upheaval. Alan begins work and dating again, although he struggles with the loss of his wife, and both he and Charlie dream of her.

===Season 3===
{{Main|List of Numb3rs episodes (season 3)}}
''Numb3rs'' was renewed for a third season,<ref name="season3">{{cite news |url=http://www.tv.com/numb3rs/show/25043/story.html?story_id=3543&tag=headlines;title;1 |title=Voila! CBS renews 14 shows at once |last=Mahan |first=Colin |publisher=TV.com |date=March 6, 2006 |accessdate=August 25, 2007}}</ref> which began airing in North America (specifically USA and Canada) at 10:00 p.m. on Friday September 22, 2006, and ended on May 18, 2007. Charlie and Amita intensify their relationship, as do Larry and Megan, especially after her kidnapping. Amita has troubles adjusting in her new role as a CalSci professor, and Larry announces his [[leave of absence]] <U+2014> he will be on the [[International Space Station]] for six months, which greatly distresses Charlie. Charlie and his colleagues are troubled by Dr. Mildred Finch, the newly-appointed Chair of the CalSci Physics, Mathematics, and Astronomy Division, whom they learn has begun dating Alan. Meanwhile, Don dates Agent Liz Warner, questions his [[ethics]] and [[self-worth]], and receives counseling. Charlie sees Don's therapist and the two understand one another more. Despite Don's concerns, Alan engages in some FBI consulting with his knowledge of engineering, and Larry returns from the space station, disillusioned. The finale wraps up with a revelation that Colby was actually a double agent for the Chinese.

Noticeable changes from previous seasons include the removal of the opening credit sequence (credits are now done during the first segment of the show), the absence of Peter MacNicol's character for much of the season, and the absence of Diane Farr's character for a few episodes. Peter MacNicol appeared in the first eleven episodes before leaving for the television show ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]'', but returned to ''Numb3rs'' for the 21st episode of season 3 ("[[The Art of Reckoning (Numb3rs)|The Art of Reckoning]]"). His character's absence was written into the show by having him become a [[Payload Specialist]] on the [[International Space Station]]. Diane Farr, pregnant for most of the season, left the show for [[maternity leave]] in episode 18 ("[[Democracy (Numb3rs)|Democracy]]"); her character's absence is explained as a special assignment to the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]].

===Season 4===
{{Main|List of Numb3rs episodes (season 4)}}
The season premiere aired on September 28, 2007, in the same time slot as in previous seasons, 10:00 p.m. [[Eastern Time]].<ref name="fall2007preview">{{cite web |url=http://www.cbs.com/primetime/fall_preview_2007/ |title=CBS 2007 Fall Preview |accessdate=August 24, 2007}}</ref> Because of the [[2007<U+2013>2008 Writers Guild of America strike|writer's strike]], only 12 episodes were initially produced. However, once the strike ended, CBS announced the show's return April 4, 2008, with six episodes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.zap2it.com/tv/news/zap-cbsreturndates,0,7656374.story |title=CBS Sets Series Return Dates |accessdate=February 13, 2008}}</ref> The season ended on May 16, 2008.

As this season starts, [[Colby Granger]] escapes from jail, and is revealed to be a [[triple agent]]. He then rejoins the team. Don and Liz break up halfway through this season, after Liz has trouble with Don's trust issues. Amita's parents come to visit, which becomes a secondary theme throughout most of the season. Because of her work at the D.O.J., Megan is conflicted by her work, and turns to Larry for help. Near the end of the season, Don's girlfriend from season 2, Robin Brooks, returns. Don and Robin then continue their relationship. Charlie attends [[FBI Academy|FBI training camp]] because he has been working with Don for several years and wants to better understand what his brother does. In the season finale, Megan leaves the team to move back to [[Washington, D.C.]], and Charlie goes head-to-head with Don about a case. This causes Charlie to send information to scientists in [[Pakistan]]. He is subsequently arrested and has his [[security clearance]] revoked, so he can no longer help Don on cases. At the end of the episode, Don drives away to another case and Charlie admits that giving up FBI work will be harder than he expected.

Several characters from previous seasons did not return in season 4. These characters include [[Mildred Finch]] and [[Ian Edgerton]] (though Edgerton appears in Season 5).

===Season 5===
{{Main|List of Numb3rs episodes (season 5)}}
The fifth season premiered on October 3, 2008, and the season finale aired on May 15, 2009.  The season premiere was moved back one week to accommodate the [[United States presidential election debates, 2008|2008 presidential debates]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/114334-CBS_Sets_Fall_Premiere_Dates.php |title=CBS Sets Fall Premiere Dates |publisher=Broadcasting & Media |accessdate=June 20, 2009}}</ref>

Season five opens three weeks after "[[When Worlds Collide (Numb3rs)|When Worlds Collide]]" (season four's season finale), with the government dropping the charges against Charlie.  Charlie gets his [[security clearance]] back after he and Don fight FBI Security Officer Carl McGowan.  Don begins to explore [[Judaism]].  The  team adds new agent Nikki Betancourt, who arrives shortly after Megan Reeves' departure.  Liz is offered a promotion but turns it down. Buck Winters (from the episodes, [[Spree (Numb3rs)|"Spree"]] and "[[Two Daughters]]") breaks out of prison and comes after Don.  Alan suddenly finds himself coaching CalSci's basketball team.  David becomes Don's primary relief supervisor.  [[DARPA]] tries to recruit Charlie, but he turns down their offer. Toward the end of the season, Don is stabbed, and Charlie blames himself for it.  The aftermath of Don's stabbing causes Charlie to focus more on his FBI consultation work.  Amita is kidnapped, and the team races to find her.  After she is rescued, Charlie proposes to Amita.  Her response is unknown.

However, "getting the math right and getting it to fit with the plot are not priorities for the ''NUMB3RS'' team", according to creator Cheryl Heuton.<ref name="silverberg">{{cite journal

An education program called ''We All Use Math Every Day'' provides educational resources based on the mathematics featured in episodes of the show. The program is run by [[Texas Instruments]] in association with the [[National Council of Teachers of Mathematics]].

A book entitled ''The Numbers Behind Numb3rs: Solving Crime with Mathematics'' (ISBN 0452288576; published August 28, 2007) has been written by [[Keith Devlin]] and Dr. Gary Lorden, a consultant to the show, explaining some of the mathematical techniques that have been used both in actual FBI cases and in other law enforcement departments.<ref name="devlin_book">{{cite web |url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/0452288576 |title=The Numbers Behind NUMB3RS: Solving Crime with Mathematics (Paperback) |publisher=[[Amazon.com]] |accessdate=2007-08-25  | ISBN=0452288576 }}</ref><ref name="redhawke_books">{{cite web |url=http://www.redhawke.org/content/view/347/89/ |title=NUMB3RS Books and DVDs |author=Lady Shelley |accessdate=2007-08-25 }}</ref>

Since the premiere season, the blog<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atsweb.neu.edu/math/cp/blog/ |title=Numb3rs blog |publisher=Atsweb.neu.edu |date=2005-06-14 |accessdate=2010-06-15}}</ref>
edited by Prof. Mark Bridger (Northeastern University) has explained the mathematics behind each episode of the show.

In Denmark, a blog<ref>http://numb3rs.math.aau.dk Numb3rs bloggen</ref> on the mathematics in ''Numb3rs'' was established when the show premiered there. It is run by Assoc. Prof Lisbeth Fajstrup and is written in Danish.

[[Wolfram Research]] (the developers of ''[[Mathematica]]'') is the chief math consultant, reviewing scripts and providing background mathematics for the show. Starting with season four, their website in collaboration with CBS is entitled "The math behind ''NUMB3RS''".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://numb3rs.wolfram.com |title=NUMB3RS Episode 412-Power-Wolfram Research Math Notes |publisher=Numb3rs.wolfram.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-15}}</ref>

===Concerns from mathematicians===
At least one mathematician consultant to the show has expressed concern with its use of mathematics, which is inserted after the script is written to provide plausible sounding [[jargon]], rather than having consultants involved at all stages of story development.<ref name="silverberg" /> Other criticisms include the show's portrayal of female mathematicians and inappropriate aspects of the relationship between [[Charlie Eppes]] and his graduate student [[Amita Ramanujan]].<ref name="silverberg" />

==Production==
The idea of ''Numb3rs'' was generated in the late 1990s when Nick Falacci and Cheryl Heuton, the show's creators, attended a lecture given by [[Bill Nye]], a popular [[Science education|science educator]].<ref name="nye">{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/printout/0,8816,1137661,00.html |title=The Numb3rs Guy |publisher=Time Magazine |date=December 4, 2005 |accessdate=2007-08-25 }}</ref> The premise of the show is similar to that of author Colin Bruce's reimaginings of the [[Sherlock Holmes]] character,<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/books/97/10/05/bib/971005.rv102432.html | work=The New York Times}}</ref> and to the "[[Mathnet]]" segment on the children's television show ''[[Square One Television|Square One]]''.

[[Gabriel Macht]] was originally cast to portray the character of Don Eppes. Also, the original concept for the show had the events take place at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]];<ref name="imdb_trivia">{{cite web |url=http://imdb.com/title/tt0433309/trivia |title="Numb3rs" (2005) Trivia |publisher=[[IMDB]] |accessdate=2007-08-25 }}</ref> this was later changed to the fictional California Institute of Science, commonly called CalSci. Scenes which take place at CalSci are filmed at [[California Institute of Technology]] (Caltech)<ref name="imdb_trivia" /> and the [[University of Southern California]]. One of the most frequent campus locations at Caltech is the vicinity of [[:Image:Millikan Library, Caltech.jpg|Millikan Library]], including the bridge over Millikan Pond, the Trustees room, and the arcades of nearby buildings. At USC, locations include Doheny Library and the Town and Gown dining room. Exteriors for the FBI offices are on the distinctive bridge at [[Los Angeles Center Studios]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0433309/locations |title="Numb3rs" (2005) - Filming locations |publisher=Us.imdb.com |date=2009-05-01 |accessdate=2010-06-15}}</ref>

Another common location is the [[American Craftsman|Craftsman home]] of the Eppes family. The house shown in the first season is real; it is owned by David Raposa and Edward Trosper,<ref name="craftsmanhome">{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/feb/17/home/hm-numbers17 |title=Arts and Crafts by the 'Numb3rs' |first=Christy |last=Hobart |work=Los Angeles Times |date=February 17, 2005 }}</ref> although a [[replica]] set was used from the second season onwards.<ref name="setfilming">{{cite web |url=http://www.fanrush.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=15 |title=NUMB3RS.org forum |accessdate=2007-05-30 }}</ref>
