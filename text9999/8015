With an area of 17,075,400 [[km<U+00B2>]], Russia is the [[List of countries and outlying territories by total area|largest country in the world]], covering almost twice the territory of the next-largest country, [[Canada]], and has the world's [[List of countries by population|eighth-largest population]]. Russia shares land borders with the following countries (counter-clockwise from northwest to southeast): [[Norway]], [[Finland]], [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Poland]], [[Belarus]], [[Ukraine]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[People's Republic of China|China]], [[Mongolia]], and [[North Korea]].

Formerly the [[Russian SFSR|Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] (RSFSR), a republic of the [[Soviet Union|Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]] (USSR), Russia is now the Federation of Russia since the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in December 1991. After the [[Soviet]] era, the area, population, and industrial production of the Soviet Union (then one of the world's two [[Cold War]] [[superpower]]s) that was located in Russia passed on to the Russian Federation.  

After the breakup of the Soviet Union, Russia went from a [[superpower]] to a [[great power]].<ref>See sources in [[superpower]] and [[great power]]</ref> Russia is considered the [[Soviet Union|Soviet Union's]] [[successor state]] in diplomatic matters (see [[Russia's membership in the United Nations]]) and is a permanent member of the [[United Nations Security Council]].

{{main|History of Russia}}

===Ancient Rus===<!--DON'T REPLACE RUS WITH RUSSIA! IT'S THERE FOR A REASON --->
[[Image:Muromian-map.png|300px|thumb|right|An approximative map of the cultures in European Russia at the arrival of the Varangians]]
Prior to the 1st century, the vast lands of southern Russia were home to scattered [[tribe]]s, such as [[Proto-Indo-Europeans]] and [[Scythians]]. Recent archaeological evidence excavated in the Volga region points to the [[Vedic]] heritage.<ref>[http://www.mosnews.com/news/2007/01/04/harevishnu.shtml Ancient Vishnu Idol]</ref> Between the 3rd and 6th centuries, the steppes were overwhelmed by successive waves of nomadic invasions, led by warlike tribes which would often move on to [[Europe]], as was the case with [[Huns]] and [[Eurasian Avars|Turkish Avars]]. A [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] people, the [[Khazars]], ruled southern Russia through the 8th century. They were important allies of the [[Byzantine Empire]] and waged a series of successful wars against the [[Arab]] [[caliphate]]s. 

In this era, the term "Rhos" or "[[Etymology of Rus and derivatives|Rus]]" first came to be applied to the Varangians and later also to the Slavs who peopled the region. As well as one of the rulers who contributed to the name "rus" [...] In the tenth to eleventh centuries this state of [[Kievan Rus]] became the largest in Europe and one of the most prosperous, due to diversified trade with both Europe and Asia. The opening of new trade routes with the [[Orient]] at the time of the [[Crusades]] contributed to the decline and fragmentation of Kievan Rus by the end of the twelfth century. 

In the 11th and 12th centuries, the constant incursions of nomadic Turkish tribes, such as the [[Kipchaks]] and the [[Pechenegs]], led to the massive migration of Slavic populations from the fertile south to the heavily forested regions of the north, known as [[Zalesye]]. The medieval states of [[Novgorod Republic]] and [[Vladimir-Suzdal]] emerged as successors to Kievan Rus on those territories, while the middle course of the [[Volga River]] came to be dominated by the Muslim state of [[Volga Bulgaria]]. Like many other parts of [[Eurasia]], these territories were [[Mongol invasion of Rus|overrun by the Mongol invaders]], who formed the state of [[Golden Horde]] which would pillage the Russian principalities for over three centuries. Later known as the [[Tatars]], they ruled the southern and central expanses of present-day Russia, while the territories of present-day [[Ukraine]] and [[Belarus]] were incorporated into the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] and [[Poland]], thus dividing the [[Russians|Russian people]] in the north from the [[Belarusians]] and [[Ukrainians]] in the west.

Similarly to the [[Balkans]] and [[Asia Minor]], long-lasting [[nomadic]] rule retarded the country's economic and social development. However, the [[Novgorod Republic]] together with [[Pskov]] retained some degree of autonomy during the time of the [[Mongol yoke]] and was largely spared the atrocities that affected the rest of the country. Led by [[Alexander Nevsky]], the Novgorodians repelled the [[Northern Crusades|Germanic crusaders]] who attempted to colonize the region.

===Muscovy===
{{main|Muscovy}}
Unlike its spiritual leader, the [[Byzantine Empire]], Russia under the leadership of [[Moscow]] was able to revive and organize its own war of reconquest, finally subjugating its enemies and annexing their territories. After the [[fall of Constantinople]] in 1453, Muscovite Russia remained the only more or less functional [[Christian]] state on the Eastern European frontier, allowing it [[Third Rome|to claim succession to the legacy]] of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]].

While still under the domain of the [[Mongol]]-[[Tatars]] and with their [[connivance]], the [[duchy of Moscow]] began to assert its influence in Western Russia in the early fourteenth century. Assisted by the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] and Saint [[Sergius of Radonezh]]'s spiritual revival, Muscovy inflicted a defeat on the Mongol-Tatars in the [[Battle of Kulikovo]] (1380). [[Ivan the Great]] eventually tossed off the control of the invaders, consolidated surrounding areas under Moscow's dominion and first took the title "grand duke of [[all the Russias]]".

In the beginning of the sixteenth century, the Russian state set the national goal to return all Russian territories lost as a result of the [[Tatar]] invasion and to protect the southern borderland against attacks of [[Crimean Tatars]] and other Turkic peoples. The noblemen, receiving a manor from the sovereign, were obliged to serve in the military. The manor system became a basis for the nobiliary horse army. 

In 1547, [[Ivan the Terrible]] was officially crowned the first [[Tsar]] of Russia. During his long reign, Ivan annexed the Tatar khanates (Kazan,Astarkhan) along the [[Volga River]] and transformed Russia into a multiethnic and multiconfessional state. By the end of the century, Russian [[Cossacks]] established the first Russian settlements in Western [[Siberia]]. But his rule was also marked by the atrocities against both the nobility and the common people on vast scale which eventually, after his death, lead to the civil war of the Time of Troubles in early 1600s. In the middle of the seventeenth century there were Russian settlements in Eastern Siberia, on [[Chukchi Peninsula]], along the [[Amur|Amur River]], on the Pacific coast, and the strait between [[North America]] and [[Asia]] was first sighted by a Russian explorer in 1648. The colonization of the Asian territories was largely peaceful, in sharp contrast to the build-up of other colonial empires of the time.

===Imperial Russia===

[[Image:Prokudin-Gorskii-05.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Three generations of a Russian family, c.1910]]
{{main|Imperial Russia}}
Muscovite control of the nascent nation continued after the [[Time of Troubles|Polish intervention]] under the subsequent [[Romanov dynasty]], beginning with Tsar [[Michael I of Russia|Michael Romanov]] in 1613. [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]] (ruled in) defeated [[Sweden]] in the [[Great Northern War]], forcing it to cede [[Ingria]], [[Estland]], and [[Livland]]. It was in Ingria that he founded a new capital, [[Saint Petersburg]]. Peter succeeded in bringing ideas and culture from Western Europe to a severely underdeveloped Russia. After his reforms, Russia emerged as a major European power. 

[[Catherine the Great]], ruling from 1762 to 1796, continued the Petrine efforts at establishing Russia as one of the [[great powers]] of Europe. Examples of its eighteenth-century European involvement include the [[War of Polish Succession]] and the [[Seven Years' War]]. In the wake of the [[Partitions of Poland]], Russia had taken territories with the ethnic Belarusian and Ukrainian population, earlier parts of Kievan Rus'. As a result of the victorious [[Russo-Turkish Wars|Russian-Turkish wars]], Russia's borders expanded to the [[Black Sea]] and Russia set its goal on the protection of Balkan Christians against a Turkish yoke. In 1783, Russia and the [[Georgia (country)|Georgian Kingdom]] (which was almost totally devastated by Persian and Turkish invasions) signed the [[treaty of Georgievsk]] according to which Georgia received the protection of Russia. 

In 1812, having gathered [[La Grande Arm<U+00E9>e|nearly half a million soldiers]] from France, as well as from all of its conquered states in Europe, [[Napoleon's Invasion of Russia|Napoleon invaded Russia]] but, after taking Moscow, was forced to retreat back to Europe. Almost 90% of the invading forces died as a result of on-going battles with the Russian army, guerillas and winter weather. The Russian armies ended their pursuit of the enemy by taking his capital, [[Paris]]. The officers of the [[Napoleonic wars]] brought back to Russia the ideas of [[liberalism]] and even attempted to curtail the tsar's powers during the abortive [[Decembrist revolt]] (1825), which was followed by several decades of political repression. Another result of the Napoleonic wars was the incorporation of [[Bessarabia]], [[Finland]], and [[Congress Poland]] into the Russian Empire. 

The perseverance of [[Russian serfdom]] and the conservative policies of [[Nicholas I of Russia]] impeded the development of Imperial Russia in the mid-nineteenth century. As a result, the country was defeated in the [[Crimean War]], 1853&ndash;1856, by an alliance of major European powers, including [[Britain]], [[France]], [[Ottoman Empire]], and [[Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia|Piedmont-Sardinia]]. Nicholas's successor [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] (1855&ndash;1881) was forced to undertake a series of comprehensive reforms and issued a [[Emancipation reform of 1861 in Russia|decree abolishing serfdom]] in 1861. The Great Reforms of Alexander's reign spurred increasingly rapid capitalist development and [[Sergei Witte]]'s attempts at [[industrialization]]. The [[Slavophile]] mood was on the rise, spearheaded by Russia's victory in the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1877<U+2013>1878|Russo-Turkish War]], which forced the Ottoman Empire to recognize the independence of [[Romania]], [[Serbia]] and [[Montenegro]] and autonomy of [[Bulgaria]]. 

The failure of [[agrarian]] reforms and suppression of the growing liberal [[intelligentsia]] were [[Russian Revolution of 1905|continuing problems]] however, and on the eve of [[World War I]], the position of Tsar [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] and his dynasty appeared precarious. Repeated devastating defeats of the Russian army in the [[Russo-Japanese War]] and World War I, and the consequent deterioration of the economy led to widespread rioting in the major cities of the [[Russian Empire]], and ultimately to the overthrow of the Tsar in February 1917.

At the close of this [[Russian Revolution of 1917]], a [[Marxist]] political faction called the [[Bolshevik]]s seized power in [[Saint Petersburg|Petrograd]] and [[Moscow]] under the leadership of [[Vladimir Lenin]]. The Bolsheviks changed their name to the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]]. A bloody [[Russian Civil War|civil war]] ensued, pitting the Bolsheviks' [[Red Army]] against a loose confederation of anti-socialist [[monarchist]] and [[bourgeois]] forces known as the [[White Army]]. The Red Army triumphed, and the [[Soviet Union]] was formed in 1922.

===Russia as part of the Soviet Union===
[[Image:StBasile SpasskayaTower Red Square Moscow.hires.jpg|right|thumb|350px|[[Saint Basil's Cathedral|St. Basil's Cathedral]] and the Spasskaya Tower of the [[Moscow Kremlin|Kremlin]] in Moscow's [[Red Square]].]]
{{main|History of the Soviet Union|Russian SFSR}}
The Soviet Union was meant to be a trans-national worker's state free from [[nationalism]]. The concept of Russia as a separate national entity was therefore not emphasized in the early Soviet Union. Although Russian institutions and cities certainly remained dominant, many non-Russians participated in the new government at all levels.

====Stalin====
One of these was a [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] named [[Joseph Stalin]]. After [[Lenin]]'s death in 1924, a brief power struggle ensued, during which Stalin gradually eroded the various [[Separation of powers|checks and balances]] which had been designed into the Soviet political system and assumed [[dictator]]ial power by the end of the decade. [[Leon Trotsky]] and almost all other [[Old Bolshevik]]s from the time of the Revolution were killed or exiled. At the end of 1930s, Stalin launched the [[Great Purge]]s, a massive series of political repressions. Millions of people whom Stalin and local authorities suspected of being a threat to their power were [[Capital punishment|executed]] or exiled to [[Gulag]] [[labor camp]]s in remote areas of [[Siberia]] or Central Asia.

[[Stalin]] forced rapid [[industrialization]] of the largely [[rural]] country and [[Collective farming|collectivization]] of its agriculture. In 1928, Stalin introduced his "First [[Five-Year Plan]]" for modernizing the Soviet economy. Most economic output was immediately diverted to establishing [[heavy industry]]. Civilian industry was modernized and many heavy weapon factories were established. The plan worked, in some sense, as the Soviet Union successfully transformed from an agrarian economy to a major industrial powerhouse in an unbelievably short span of time, but widespread misery and [[famine]] ensued for many millions of people as a result of the severe [[economic]] upheaval.

After the [[Great Patriotic War]] started in 1941 the [[Wehrmacht|German army]] had considerable success in the early stages of the campaign, but they suffered defeat when they reached the outskirts of Moscow. The [[Red Army]] then stopped the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] offensive at the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] in 1943, which became the decisive turning point for Germany's fortunes in the war. The Soviets drove through [[Eastern Europe]] and [[Battle of Berlin|captured Berlin]] before Germany surrendered in 1945 (see [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Great Patriotic War]]). During the war, the [[Soviet Union]] lost more than 27 million [[citizens]] (including eighteen million [[civilians]]).

Although ravaged by the war, the Soviet Union emerged from the conflict as an acknowledged superpower. The [[Red Army]] occupied [[Eastern Europe]] after the war, including the [[East Germany|eastern half of Germany]]. Stalin installed loyal [[communism|communist]] governments in these [[satellite state]]s.

During the immediate postwar period, the Soviet Union first rebuilt and then expanded its economy, with control always exerted exclusively from Moscow. The Soviets extracted heavy [[war reparations]] from the areas of Germany under their control, mostly in the form of machinery and industrial equipment. The Soviet Union consolidated its hold on Eastern Europe (see [[Eastern bloc]]). The [[United States]] helped the [[Western Europe]]an countries establish democracies, and both countries sought to achieve economic, political, and ideological dominance over the [[Third World]]. The ensuing struggle became known as the [[Cold War]], which turned the Soviet Union's wartime allies, the [[United Kingdom]] and the United States, into its foes.

Stalin died in early 1953 presumably without leaving any instructions for the selection of a successor. His closest associates officially decided to rule the Soviet Union jointly, but the secret police chief [[Lavrenty Beria]] appeared poised to seize dictatorial control. [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]] [[Nikita Khrushchev]] and other leading politicians organized an anti-Beria alliance and staged a [[coup d'<U+00E9>tat]]. Beria was arrested in June 1953 and executed later that year; Khrushchev became the undisputed leader of the Soviet Union.

====Khrushchev====
[[Image:Yuri Gagarin and Nikita Khrushchev 14 April 1961.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Khruschev and [[Yuri Gagarin]] ]]

Under Khrushchev, the Soviet Union launched the world's first artificial [[satellite]], [[Sputnik 1]], and the Soviet [[astronaut|cosmonaut]] [[Yuri Gagarin]] became the first human to orbit the [[Earth]] aboard the first manned spacecraft, [[Vostok 1]]. Khrushchev's reforms in [[agriculture]] and administration, however, were generally unproductive, and [[Sino-Russian relations|foreign policy toward China]] and the [[Russo-United States relations|United States]] suffered reverses, notably the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]], when he began installing nuclear missiles in [[Cuba]] (after the United States installed [[Jupiter missile]]s in [[Turkey]] which nearly provoked a war with the Soviet Union). Over the course of several angry outbursts at the [[United Nations]], Khrushchev was increasingly seen by his colleagues as belligerent, boorish, and dangerous. The remainder of the Soviet leadership removed him from power in 1964.

Following the ousting of Khrushchev, another period of rule by collective leadership ensued, lasting until [[Leonid Brezhnev]] established himself in the early 1970s as the pre-eminent figure in Soviet political life. Brezhnev is frequently derided by historians for stagnating the development of the Soviet Union (see "[[Brezhnev stagnation]]"). Others have acknowledged that despite its inertia and repression (though very mild relative to the Stalin years), the Brezhnev era did offer a relative respite to a populace and leadership battered by decades of war, famine, collectivization and crash industrialization, deadly political crises, arbitrary mass murder and arrest, and the volatility of the Krushchev years.  In contrast to the revolutionary spirit that accompanied the birth of the Soviet Union, the prevailing mood of the Soviet leadership at the time of Brezhnev's death in 1982 was one of aversion to change--partly because the USSR's economic woes were proving to be deeply systemic and hence immune to reform within the context of the Stalinist-Soviet system.

====Gorbachev====
In the mid 1980s, the reform-minded [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] came to power. He introduced the landmark policies of ''[[glasnost]]'' (openness) and ''[[perestroika]]'' (restructuring), in an attempt to modernize Soviet communism. Glasnost meant that the harsh restrictions on [[Freedom of speech|free speech]] that had characterized most of the Soviet Union's existence were removed, and open political discourse and criticism of the government became possible again. Perestroika meant sweeping economic reforms designed to decentralize the planning of the Soviet economy. However, the Stalinist system was probably beyond repair, and the Gorbachev reforms started in motion forces of change that demonstrated that meaningful reform would eventually threaten Communist Party hegemony, i.e. the Soviet system would not survive any successful reform program intact.  His initiatives also provoked strong resentment amongst conservative elements of the government, and an unsuccessful [[Soviet coup attempt of 1991|military coup]] that attempted to remove Gorbachev from power instead led to the collapse of the Soviet Union. [[Boris Yeltsin]] came to power and declared the end of exclusive Communist rule. The USSR splintered into fifteen independent republics, and was officially dissolved in December of 1991 (see [[History of the Soviet Union]]).

Since then, Russia has struggled in its efforts to build a democratic political system and a [[market economy]] to replace the strict centralized social, political, and economic controls of the Soviet era.  Corruption has run rampant, and the Yeltsin government conspired with insiders to loot countless billions in cash and assets from the State.  Under Vladimir Putin, political freedom has waned considerably.

[[Image:Dayrussia.jpg|thumb|right|The National Holiday of Russia being celebrated on June 12, 2006 in Red Square]]
Prior to the dissolution of the Soviet Union, [[Boris Yeltsin]] had been elected President of Russia in June 1991 in the first direct presidential election in Russian history. In October 1991, as Russia was on the verge of independence, Yeltsin announced that Russia would proceed with radical market-oriented reform along the lines of "[[shock therapy (economics)|shock therapy]]".

After the disintegration of the USSR, the Russian economy went through a crisis. Russia took up the responsibility for settling the USSR's [[external debt]]s, even though its population made up just half of the population of the USSR at the time of its dissolution. The largest state enterprises (petroleum, metallurgy, and the like) were controversially privatized for the small sum of $US 600 million, far less than they were worth, while the majority of the population plunged into poverty.

Russia's [[Congress of People's Deputies]], in which the [[Communist]] presence was the strongest, attempted to impeach Yeltsin on [[March 26]], [[1993]]. Yeltsin's opponents gathered more than 600&nbsp;votes for impeachment, but fell 72&nbsp;votes short. On [[September 21]], [[1993]], Yeltsin disbanded the [[Supreme Soviet]] and the Congress of People's Deputies by decree, which was illegal under the constitution. On the same day there was a military showdown: the [[Russian constitutional crisis of 1993]]. With military help, Yeltsin held control. The conflict resulted in a number of civilian casualties, but was resolved in Yeltsin's favor. According to different sources, the total number of deceased was between 300 and 2,000 people. Elections were held and the current [[Constitution of the Russian Federation]] was adopted on [[December 12]], [[1993]].
[[Image:Modernmoscow.jpg|thumb|260px|left|Modern Moscow]]
The 1990s were plagued by armed ethnic conflicts in the [[North Caucasus]]. Such conflicts took a form of [[separatist]] insurrections against federal power (most notably in [[Chechnya]]), or of ethnic/clan conflicts between local groups (e.g., in [[North Ossetia-Alania]] between [[Ossetians]] and [[Ingush people|Ingushs]], or between different clans in Chechnya). Since the [[Chechnya|Chechen]] separatists declared independence in the early 1990s, an intermittent [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla war]] ([[First Chechen War]], [[Second Chechen War]]) has been fought between disparate Chechen groups and the Russian military. Some of these groups have grown increasingly [[Islamist]] over the course of the struggle. The total number of [[refugees]] and [[internally displaced persons]] from these territories today is about 100,000 people.

After Yeltsin's presidency in the 1990s, the recently appointed Prime Minister (who was also head of the [[Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation|FSB]] from July 1998 through August 1999) [[Vladimir Putin]] was elected in 2000. Although President Putin is still the most popular Russian politician, with a 70% approval rating, his policies raised serious concerns about [[civil society]] and [[human rights]] in Russia.  The West--particularly the United States--expressed growing worries about the state control of the Russian [[mass media|media]] through Kremlin-friendly companies, government influence on elections, and [[law enforcement]] abuses.<ref>[http://www.korrespondent.net/main/152865]</ref>

At the same time, high [[oil]] prices and growing internal demand boosted Russian economic growth, stimulating significant economic expansion abroad and helping to finance increased military spending. Putin's presidency has shown improvements in the Russian standard of living, as opposed to the 1990s.<ref>[http://www.1tv.ru/owa/win/ort6_main.print_version?p_news_title_id=73069]</ref> Even with these economic improvements, the government is criticized for lack of will to fight wide-spread crime and [[Political corruption|corruption]] and to renovate deteriorated urban infrastructure throughout the country.

Despite the economic distress and decreased military funding following the fall of the Soviet Union, the country  retains its large weapons and especially [[nuclear weapons]] arsenal. When the Soviet Union collapsed it gave up its [[superpower]] status and left America as the only superpower in a unipolar world. Nevertheless, Russia is commonly considered a [[great power]] as the largest and most influential successor state to the Soviet Union.<ref name="Danilovic">Danilovic, Vesna - When the Stakes Are High - Deterrence and Conflict among Major Powers, University of Michigan Press (2002) [http://www.press.umich.edu/pdf/0472112872-appb.pdf - (PDF copy)].</ref>

==Politics==
{{morepolitics|country=Russia}}<!--Please add new information into relevant articles of the series-->
The politics of Russia (the Russian Federation) take place in a framework of a [[federation|federal]] [[presidential system|presidential]] [[republic]], whereby the [[President of Russia]] is both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]], and of a pluriform multi-party system. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the [[government]] and the two chambers of the [[Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation]]. Most of the this happens in Moscow in the Kremlin.

==Subdivisions==
{{Main|Subdivisions of Russia}}

;Federal subjects
[[Image:Russia Div.png|thumb|right|300px|Map of the subdivisions of the Russian Federation]]

Russian Federation comprises 86&nbsp;[[federal subjects of Russia|federal subject]]s, namely:
* 48 [[oblast]]s (provinces)
* 21 [[republic]]s which enjoy a high degree of autonomy on most issues and which correspond to some of Russia's numerous ethnic minorities
* seven [[krai]]s (territories)
* seven [[okrug]]s (autonomous districts)
* two federal cities ([[Moscow]] and [[Saint Petersburg|St.&nbsp;Petersburg]])
* the [[Jewish Autonomous Oblast]].

;Federal districts
Federal subjects are grouped into [[federal districts of Russia|federal districts]], four in Europe and three in Asia. Unlike the federal subjects, the federal districts are not a subnational level of government, but are a level of administration of the federal government.

{{main|Geography of Russia}}
===Topography===
The Russian Federation stretches across much of the north of the supercontinent of [[Eurasia]]. Although it contains a large share of the world's [[Arctic]] and [[sub-Arctic]] areas, and therefore has less population, economic activity, and physical variety per unit area than most countries, the great area south of these still accommodates a great variety of landscapes and [[climate]]s. The mid-annual temperature is +5.5<U+00B0>C (22<U+00B0>[[Fahrenheit|F]]). For comparison, the mid-annual temperature in [[Iceland]] is +1.2<U+00B0>C (34<U+00B0>F) and in Sweden is +4<U+00B0>C (39<U+00B0>F), although the variety of climates within Russia makes such a comparison somewhat misleading, due to the extremely low temperatures in Siberia. Areas in the south of Russia have a subtropical climate, where year-round temperatures do not fall below +8<U+00B0>C.
The average summer high temperature ranges between 26<U+00B0>C and 32<U+00B0>C (80 to 88<U+00B0>F) with occasional extreme heat in some interior locations exceeding 51<U+00B0>C (112<U+00B0>F)

Most of the land consists of vast plains, both in the [[Europe]]an part and the part of [[Asia]]n territory that is largely known as [[Siberia]]. These plains are predominantly [[steppe]] to the south and heavily forested to the north, with [[tundra]] along the northern coast. The [[permafrost]] (areas of Siberia and the Far East) occupies more than half of the territory of Russia. Mountain ranges are found along the southern borders, such as the [[Caucasus]] (containing [[Mount Elbrus]], Russia's and Europe's highest point at 5,642&nbsp;m / 18,511 [[foot (unit of length)|ft]]) and the [[Altay Mountains|Altai]], and in the eastern parts, such as the [[Verkhoyansk Range]] or the [[volcano]]es on [[Kamchatka Peninsula|Kamchatka]]. The more central [[Ural Mountains]], a north-south range that form the primary divide between Europe and Asia, are also notable.

Russia has an extensive '''coastline''' of over 37,000 kilometres (23,000 [[mile|mi]]) along the [[Arctic Ocean|Arctic]] and [[Pacific Ocean]]s, as well as the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]], [[Black Sea|Black]] and [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] seas. Some smaller bodies of water are part of the open oceans; the [[Barents Sea]], [[White Sea]], [[Kara Sea]], [[Laptev Sea]] and [[East Siberian Sea]] are part of the Arctic, whereas the [[Bering Sea]], [[Sea of Okhotsk]] and the [[Sea of Japan]] belong to the Pacific Ocean.

Major '''islands and archipelagos''' include [[Novaya Zemlya]], the [[Franz Josef Land]], the [[New Siberian Islands]], [[Wrangel Island]], the [[Kurile Islands|Kuril Islands]] and [[Sakhalin]]. (See [[List of islands of Russia]]).  The [[Diomede Islands]] (one controlled by Russia, the other by the United States) are just three [[kilometer]]s (1.9&nbsp;[[mile|mi]]) apart, and [[Kunashir Island]] (controlled by Russia but [[Kuril Islands dispute|claimed by Japan]]) is about twenty kilometres (12 mi) from [[Hokkaid<U+014D>]].

Many '''rivers''' flow across Russia; see [[Rivers of Russia]].

Major '''lakes''' include [[Lake Baikal]], [[Lake Ladoga]] and [[Lake Onega]]. See [[List of lakes in Russia]].

===Borders===
[[Image:Rs-map.png|right|thumb|300px|Map of the Russian Federation]]
The most practical way to describe Russia is as a main part (a large contiguous portion with its off-shore islands) and an [[exclave]], [[Kaliningrad]], (at the southeast corner of the Baltic Sea).

The main part's borders and coasts (starting in the far northwest and proceeding counter-clockwise) are:
*borders with the following countries: [[Norway]] and [[Finland]],
*a short coast on the [[Baltic Sea]], facing eight other [[Baltic Sea#Adjacent Countries|countries on its shores]] from Finland to Estonia and including the port of St. Petersburg,
*borders with [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], [[Belarus]], and [[Ukraine]],
*a coast on the [[Black Sea]], facing five other [[Black Sea#Adjacent Countries|countries on its shores]] from Ukraine to Georgia,
*borders with [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Azerbaijan]],
*a coast on the [[Caspian Sea]], facing four other [[Caspian Sea#Adjacent Countries|countries on its shores]] from [[Azerbaijan]] to [[Kazakhstan]],
*borders with [[Kazakhstan]], [[China (PRC)|China]] (western), [[Mongolia]], [[China (PRC)|China]] (eastern), and [[North Korea]].
*an extensive coastline that provides access to all the maritime nations of the world, and stretches
**from the North [[Pacific Ocean]] including
***the [[Sea of Japan]] (where the west shore of Russia's [[Sakhalin]] lies), 
***the [[Sea of Okhotsk]] (where the east shore of [[Sakhalin]] and its [[Kurile Islands]] lie), and
***the [[Bering Sea]],
**through the [[Bering Strait]] (where its minor island of [[Big Diomede]] is separated by only a few miles from [[Little Diomede]], a part of the [[United States|US]] [[U.S. state|state]] of [[Alaska]]),
**to the [[Arctic Ocean]], including
***the [[Chukchi Sea]] (where the south and east shores of its [[Wrangel Island]] lie),
***the [[East Siberian Sea]] (where its west shore, and the east shores of its [[New Siberian Islands]] lie),
***the [[Laptev Sea]] (where their west shores lie),
***the [[Kara Sea]] (where the east shore of its [[Novaya Zemlya]] lies),
***the [[Barents Sea]] (where their west shore, the south shores of its [[Franz-Josef Land]] the port of [[Murmansk]] and important naval facilities lie, and where the [[White Sea]] reaches far inland).

The [[exclave]], constituted by the [[Kaliningrad Oblast]], 
*shares borders with
**[[Poland]] to its south and
**[[Lithuania]] to its north and east, and
*has a northwest coast on the Baltic Sea.

The [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] and [[Black Sea]] coasts of Russia have less direct and more constrained access to the high seas than its Pacific and Arctic ones, but both are nevertheless important for that purpose. The Baltic gives immediate access to the nine other countries sharing its shores, and between the main part of Russia and its [[Kaliningrad]] Oblast exclave. Via the straits that lie within [[Denmark]], and between it and Sweden, the Baltic connects to the [[North Sea]] and the oceans to its west and north. The Black Sea gives immediate access to the five other countries sharing its shores, and via the [[Dardanelles]] and [[Sea of Marmora|Marmora]] straits adjacent to [[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]], to the [[Mediterranean Sea]] with its many countries and its access, via the [[Suez Canal]] and the [[Straits of Gibraltar]], to the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. The salt waters of the [[Caspian Sea]], the world's largest lake, provide no access to the high seas.

===Spatial extent===

The two most widely separated points in Russia are about 8,000&nbsp;km (5,000 mi) apart along a [[geodesic]] (i.e. shortest line between two points on the Earth's surface). These points are: the boundary with [[Poland]] on a 60-km-long (40-mi-long) [[Vistula Spit|spit of land]] separating the [[Gdansk Bay|Gulf of Gda<U+0144>sk]] from the [[Vistula Lagoon]]; and the farthest southeast of the [[Kurile Islands]], a few miles off [[Hokkaid<U+014D>|Hokkaid<U+014D> Island]], Japan.

The points which are furthest separated in longitude are "only" 6,600&nbsp;km (4,100 mi) apart along a geodesic. These points are: in the West, the same spit; in the East, the [[Diomede Islands|Big Diomede Island]] (Ostrov Ratmanova).

The Russian Federation spans eleven [[time zone]]s.

==Economy==
{{main|Economy of Russia}}
[[Image:Soviet Electric grid 82.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Map of the electric grid during the Soviet era.]]
===Introduction===
More than a decade after the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, Russia is now trying to further develop a [[market economy]] and achieve more consistent economic growth. Russia saw its comparatively developed centrally [[planned economy]] contract severely for five years, as the [[executive (government)|executive]] and the [[legislature]] [[wiktionary:dithered|dithered]] over the implementation of reforms and Russia's aging industrial base faced a serious decline.

===Crash===
:''Main article: [[Russian financial crisis]]''

After the breakup of the Soviet Union, Russia's first slight recovery, showing signs of open-market influence, occurred in 1997. In 1998, however, the [[Asian financial crisis]] culminated in the August [[depreciation]] of the [[Russian ruble|ruble]].  This was followed by a [[Default (finance)|debt default]] by the government in 1998, and a sharp deterioration in living standards for most of the population. Consequently, 1998 was marked by recession and an intense [[capital flight]].

===Recovery===
[[Image:Alexei Kudrin, 2006 G8.jpg|right|thumb|[[Alexei Kudrin]], Russian finance minister.]]
Nevertheless, the economy started recovering in 1999. The recovery was greatly assisted by the weak ruble, which made imports expensive and boosted local production. Then it entered a phase of rapid economic expansion, the [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] growing by an average of 6.7% annually in 1999&ndash;2005 on the back of higher [[petroleum]] prices, a weaker ruble, and increasing service production and industrial output. The country is presently running a huge [[trade surplus]], which has been helped by protective import barriers, and rampant corruption which ensures that it is almost impossible for foreign and local [[Small and medium enterprise|SME]]s (small and medium sized enterprises) to import goods without the help of local specialist import firms, such as the [[Russia Import Company]]. Some import barriers are expected to be abolished after Russia's accession to the [[WTO]].

The recent recovery, made possible due to high world oil prices, along with a renewed government effort in 2000 and 2001 to advance lagging structural reforms, has raised business and investor confidence over Russia's prospects in its second decade of transition. Russia remains heavily dependent on exports of commodities, particularly oil, [[natural gas]], metals, and [[timber]], which account for about 80% of exports, leaving the country vulnerable to swings in world prices. Industrial military exports after undergoing sharp contraction is now the major non-commodity export. In recent years, however, the economy has also been driven by growing internal consumer demand that has increased by over 12% annually in 2000&ndash;2005, showing the strengthening of its own internal market.

The economic development of the country has been extremely uneven: the Moscow region contributes one-third of the country's GDP while having only a tenth of its population. GDP increased by 7.2% in 2004, 6.4% in 2005 and about 7% in 2006.

===Recent economy===
The country's [[GDP]] (PPP) soared to $1.5 trillion in 2004, making it the ninth largest economy in the world and the fifth largest in Europe. If the current growth rate is sustained, the country is expected to become the second largest European economy after Germany and the sixth largest in the world within a few years.

In 2005, according to the [http://www.fsgs.ru Federal Service of State Statistics], GDP reached $765 billion nominally (21.7 trillion [[Russian ruble|rubles]]), equal to $1.6 trillion in international dollars (PPP; [[purchasing power parity]]). Inflation was 10.9% percent. Expenditures of the consolidated budget have reached 5942 billion rubles ($215 billion). The government plans to reduce the tax burden, although the time and scale of such a reduction remains undecided.
However, some experts ([http://www.rusbizconf.com/russiaeconomny.htm] [http://www.kommersant.ru/doc.html?docId=715800]) believe that official statistic underestimates Russian GDP by 28% because of inaccuracy of decades old statistical system (for example, it didn<U+2019>t count small enterprises and whole sectors of new economy). IMSG estimated that nominal Russian GDP reached $970 billion in 2005 [http://www.rusbizconf.com/russiaeconomny.htm].

In 2006, GDP grew to $1018 billion nominally (26.31 trillion rubles; 2.04 trillion in PPP dollars)[http://news.liga.net/news/N0704775.html].

[[Image:Russia1000rubles04front.jpg|right|thumb|300px|1000 [[Russian ruble|ruble]] note, depicting [[Yaroslavl]].]]
In 2005 Russia exported 241.3 billion dollars and imported 98.5 billion dollars. This means that Russia registered a trade surplus of  142.8 billion dollars in 2005, up about 33% from 2004's foreign trade surplus of $106.1 billion dollars.[http://english.people.com.cn/200602/13/eng20060213_242237.html] 

In 2006, export grew to $304 billion, import to $164 billion; foreign trade surplus grew 19% to $141 billion [http://www.gks.ru/bgd/free/b04_03/IssWWW.exe/Stg/d020/i020470r.htm]

It's estimated what direct foreign investment reach at least $23 billion in 2006[http://www.rg.ru/2006/12/27/investicii.html], overall foreign investments reached $55 billion[http://www.gks.ru/bgd/free/b04_03/IssWWW.exe/Stg/d020/i020490r.htm].

On January 5, 2007 Russia's international reserves reached $303.9 billion nominally and projected to grow to $350<U+2013>450 billion by the end of 2007 [http://www.cbr.ru/Eng/statistics/credit_statistics/print.asp?file=inter_res_07_e.htm][http://www.finam.ru/analysis/investorquestion000010F50A/default.asp].

Thanks to high oil prices, Russian oil exports totaled $117 billion in 2005 while gas exports totaled $32 billion in the same year. That means that oil and gas made up 60% of total Russian exports in 2005.[http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000087&sid=ar4D7HVGikXo&refer=top_world_news]




Knowing the importance of oil and gas to the economy, a Stabilization Fund was formed by the government in January 2004. This fund takes in revenues from oil and gas exports and is designed to help offset oil market volatility. This fund was also set up in order to prevent the ruble from appreciating. The Stabilization Fund (SF) grew to $76.6 billion in November 2006. 
Russia's Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Zhukov said in October 2006 the fund will continue to increase over the coming years, and will exceed $149 billion by late 2007 and about $260.4 billion by the end of 2009. Russia is paying off its foreign debt mainly from the Stabilization Fund, which hit $76.9 billion as of July 1. Russia repaid the bulk of its outstanding debt to the Paris Club of Creditor Nations on August 18-21. The debt totaled $1.9 billion as of October 1, compared to $23.7 billion on July 1. [http://en.rian.ru/russia/20061101/55291557.html]
 
According to the [[Federal republic|Federal]] State [[Statistics]] Service of Russia, the monthly nominal [[average]] [[salary]] in January 2007 was 11,410 rubles (about $437 nominally; about $793 PPP), 26.6 percent higher than in January 2006[http://www.gks.ru/bgd/free/b07_00/IssWWW.exe/Stg/d01/05-0.htm].

For the year of 2007, Russia's GDP is projected to grow to about $1.2 trillion nominally (31.2 trillion rubles) that would be about $2.3 trillion PPP and would make Russia the second largest economy in Europe. [http://en.rian.ru/russia/20060817/52761584.html]

===Challenge===
Some perceive the greatest challenge facing the Russian economy to be encouraging the development of [[Small and Medium-sized Enterprise]]s in a business climate with a young and less-than-sufficient functional banking system. Few of Russia's banks are owned by [[oligarchs]], who often use the deposits to lend to their own businesses. The 2005 [http://www.milkeninstitute.org/pdf/cai_rankings_2005.pdf Milken Institute's ratings] place Russia at the 51st place in the world, out of 121 countries by the availability of capital.

The [[European Bank for Reconstruction and Development]] and the [[World Bank]] have attempted to kick-start normal banking practices by making equity and debt investments in a number of banks, but with very limited success.

However, about twenty-five of the biggest banks of Russia get entry into Top 1000 banks of the world by ''[[The Banker]]'' [http://moskva.aif.ru/issues/637/22_02].  Many more Russian banks have very high international [[ratings]] by [[Moody's]] and [[Fitch]], including "investment" level.

Other problems include disproportional economic development of Russia's own regions. While the huge capital region of Moscow is a bustling, affluent metropolis living on the cutting edge of technology with a [[per capita income]] rapidly approaching that of the leading Eurozone economies, much of the country, especially its indigenous and rural communities in Asia, lags significantly behind. Market integration is nonetheless making itself felt in some other sizeable cities such as [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Kaliningrad]], and [[Ekaterinburg]], and recently also in the adjacent rural areas.

The arrest of Russia's wealthiest businessman [[Mikhail Khodorkovsky]] on charges of fraud and corruption in relation to the large-scale privatizations organized under then-President [[Boris Yeltsin|Yeltsin]], contrary to some expectations, has not caused most foreign investors to worry about the stability of the Russian economy. Most of the large fortunes currently in evidence in Russia are the product of either acquiring government assets at particularly low costs or gaining concessions from the government. Other countries have expressed concerns and worries at the "selective" application of the [[law]] against individual businessmen, though government actions have been received positively in Russia. Russia occupies 122th place among 157 countries in the [[Index of Economic Freedom]].

===Prospect===
[[Image:TSU-2004-19924.jpg|thumb|[[Tomsk State University]].]]
Encouraging foreign investment is also a major challenge due to legal, cultural, linguistic, economic and political peculiarities of the country. Nevertheless, there has been a significant inflow of capital in recent years from many European investors attracted by cheaper land, labor and higher growth rates than in the rest of Europe

Very high levels of education and societal involvement achieved by the majority of the population, including women and minorities, [[secular]] attitudes, mobile class structure, and better integration of various minorities into the mainstream culture set Russia far apart from the majority of the so-called [[developing countries]] and even some developed nations.

The country is also benefiting from rising oil prices and has been able very substantially to reduce its formerly huge foreign debt. However, equal redistribution of capital gains from the natural resource industries to other sectors is still a problem. Nonetheless, since 2003, exports of natural resources started decreasing in economic importance as the internal market has strengthened considerably, largely stimulated by intense construction, as well as consumption of increasingly diverse goods and services. Yet teaching customers and encouraging consumer spending is a relatively tough task for many [[province|provincial]] areas where consumer demand is primitive. However, some laudable progress has been made in larger cities, especially in the clothing, food, and entertainment industries.

Additionally, some international firms are investing in Russia. According to the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), Russia had nearly $26 billion in cumulative foreign direct investment inflows during the period (of which $11.7 billion occurred in 2004).

Russia faces considerable income inequalities that hinder Russia's potential to become a more diversified economy.

==Demographics==
{{main|Demographics of Russia}}

Despite its comparatively high population, Russia has a low average population density due to its enormous size. Population is densest in the European part of Russia, in the [[Ural Mountains]] area, and in the south-western parts of Siberia; the south-eastern part of [[Siberia]] that meets the [[Pacific Ocean]], known as the [[Russian Far East]], is sparsely populated, with its southern part being densest. The Russian Federation is home to as many as 160 different [[ethnic groups]] and [[indigenous people]]s. As of the [[Russian Census (2002)|2002 Russian census]], 79.8% of the population is ethnically [[Russians|Russian]], 3.8% [[Volga Tatars|Tatar]], 2% [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]], 1.2% [[Bashkir]], 1.1% [[Chuvash]], 0.9% [[Chechen people|Chechen]], 0.8% [[Armenians|Armenian]]. The remaining 10.3% includes those who did not specify their [[ethnicity]] as well as (in alphabetical order)
[[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], [[Caucasian Avars|Avars]], [[Azeris in Russia|Azeris]], [[Belarusians]], [[Bulgarians]], [[Buryat]]s, [[Han Chinese|Chinese]], [[Cossack]]s, [[Estonians]], [[Evenks]], [[Finnish people|Finns]], [[Georgian people|Georgians]], [[German minority in Russia and Soviet Union|Germans]], [[Greeks]], [[Ingush people|Ingushes]], [[Inuit]], [[Jews]], [[Kalmyks]], [[Karelians]], [[Kazakhs]], [[Koreans]], [[Kyrgyz]], [[Lithuanians]], [[Latvians]], [[Mari]]s, [[Mongols|Mongolian]]s, [[Mordvins]], [[Nenetses]], [[Ossetians]], [[Poles]], [[Romanians]], [[Tajiks]], [[Tuvans]], [[Turkmen people|Turkmen]], [[Udmurts]], [[Uzbeks]], [[Yakuts]], and others. Nearly all of these groups live compactly in their respective regions; Russians and to a lesser extent Tatars are the only people significantly represented in every region of the country.

In October 2005, the federal statistics agency reported that Russia's population has shrunk by more than half a million people dipping to 143 million.<ref>{{cite web|title=Resident population| url=http://www.gks.ru/free_doc/2006/rus06e/05-01.htm |date=30 January 2007 | accessdate=2007-02-06 }}</ref> The major reason for this decline is the high death rate.<ref>{{cite web|title=Population Decline in Russia| url=http://geography.about.com/od/obtainpopulationdata/a/russiapop.htm|date=30 January 2007 | accessdate=2007-02-06 }}</ref>
Russia is also the second-country in the world by the number of immigrants from abroad.

The [[Russian language]] is the only official state language, but the individual [[Republics of Russia|republics]] have often made their native language co-official next to Russian. The [[Cyrillic alphabet]] is the only [[official script]], which means that these languages must be written in Cyrillic in official texts.
[[Image:Kazankremlinnew.jpg|thumb|right|500px|[[Kazan Kremlin]] harmoniously combines elements of Eastern Orthodox and Muslim cultures.]]
[[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodoxy]] is the dominant religion in the Federation. [[Islam]] is the second most widespread religion, predominating in the [[Volga]] region and Caucasus. Other religions include various [[Protestant]] churches, [[Judaism]], [[Roman Catholicism]] and [[Buddhism]]. Induction into religion takes place primarily along ethnic lines. Ethnic Russians are mainly Orthodox whereas most people of [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] and [[Caucasus|Caucasian]] extraction are [[Sunni Muslim]]. [[Kalmyks]] are the only predominantly Buddhist people in Europe. However, due to decades of suppression of religion during Soviet times, religious adherence remains nominal for most of the population.
