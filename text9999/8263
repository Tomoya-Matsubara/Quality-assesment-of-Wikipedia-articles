'''Terasca''', or '''Terrier-ASROC-Cajun''', was an American three-stage [[sounding rocket]] developed and launched by the [[United States Navy]]. Derived from a combination of the [[RIM-2 Terrier|Terrier]], [[RUR-5 ASROC|ASROC]] and [[Cajun (rocket)|Cajun]] rockets, three launches were attempted during 1959, but only one was successful.

==Design and development==
The Terrier-ASROC-Cajun ("Terasca") rocket was developed during early 1959 by the [[Naval Ordnance Test Station]], located at [[China Lake, California]], to fill a U.S. Navy requirement for a three-stage sounding rocket, intended to launch experimental payloads for conducting high-altitude research.<ref>FAA 2005, p.37.</ref><ref name="Museum">''The Rocketeer'', Nov. 1993</ref> The rocket utilised a combination of existing missiles in its construction; the first stage was a Terrier [[surface-to-air]] missile; an ASROC [[anti-submarine rocket]] made up the second stage, while a Cajun sounding rocket was utilised as a third stage.<ref name="DS">Parsch 2007</ref>

The Terrier first stage produced {{convert|258|kN|abbr=on|disp=flip}} thrust,<ref name="DS"/> while the ASROC second stage provided  {{convert|49|kN|abbr=on|disp=flip}},<ref>Chant 1990, p.236.</ref> and the third-stage Cajun motor had a thrust rated at {{convert|36|kN|abbr=on|disp=flip}}.<ref name="DS"/> The theoretical [[apogee]] for Terasca was {{convert|98|mi}}; it could carry a scientific payload of up to {{convert|25|lb}}.<ref>Corliss 1971, p.83.</ref>

==Operational history==
Three launch attempts of the Terasca missile were made from the launch facility at [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]] during 1959, utilising the [[Western Launch and Test Range]]. The first launch attempt took place on May 1; this launch was a failure.<ref name="DS"/><ref name="EA">{{cite web |url=http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/tercajun.htm |title=Terrier ASROC Cajun  |work=Encyclopedia Astronautica |accessdate=2011-01-15}}</ref> A second launch attempt on June 26, however, was successful, with the rocket reaching an apogee of {{convert|60|mi}}.<ref name="DS"/><ref name="EA"/> A third launch, attempted on August 12, however, was also a failure;<ref name="EA"/> following the third launch, the Terasca program came to a close.<ref name="DS"/>
