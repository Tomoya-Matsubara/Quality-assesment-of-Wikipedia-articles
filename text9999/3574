'''Backmasking''' (also known as ''[[backward masking]]'')<ref>Backward(s) masking has two other meanings; see [[backward masking]]. See also {{cite web |last=Crispen |first=Bob |title=Backward Masking&nbsp;<U+2026> another pious fraud |url=http://www.crispen.org/rants/backward.html |publisher=The Crispen Family|accessdate=2006-09-01}}</ref> is a [[sound recording and reproduction|recording]] technique in which a sound or message is recorded backward on to a track that is meant to be played forward. Backmasking is a deliberate process, whereas a message found through [[phonetic reversal]] may be unintentional.

Backmasking was popularised by [[The Beatles]], who used backward instrumentation on their 1966 album ''[[Revolver (album)|Revolver]]''.<ref name="sullivan">{{cite journal |last=Sullivan |first=Mark |title='More Popular Than Jesus': The Beatles and the Religious Far Right |journal=Popular Music |year=1987 |month=October |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=313<U+2013>326 |doi=10.1017/S0261143000002348}}</ref> Artists have since used backmasking for artistic, comedic and satiric effect, on both analogue and digital recordings. The technique has also been used to censor words or phrases for "clean" releases of rap songs.

Backmasking has been a controversial topic in the United States since the 1980s, when allegations from Christian groups of its use for [[satanism|Satanic]] purposes were made against prominent [[rock music]]ians, leading to record-burning protests and proposed anti-backmasking legislation by state and federal governments.<ref>Billiter, Bill (April 28, 1982).

==History==
===Development===
In 1877 [[Thomas Edison]] invented the [[phonograph]], a device allowing [[sound]] to be [[sound recording and reproduction|recorded and reproduced]] on a rotating cylinder with a [[stylus]] (or "needle") attached to a diaphragm mounted at the narrow end of a horn. [[Emile Berliner]] invented the familiar lateral-cut disc [[gramophone record|phonograph record]] in 1888. His design overtook the Edison phonograph in the 1920s, since Berliner's patent expired in 1918, and others were then free to use his invention.

In addition to recreating recorded sounds by placing the stylus on the cylinder or disc and rotating it in the same direction as during the recording, one could hear different sounds by rotating the cylinder or disc backwards.<ref>{{cite web |last=Kittler |first=Friedrick |title=The Gramaphone |work=Adventures in CyberSound |publisher=[[Australian Centre for the Moving Image]] |url=http://www.acmi.net.au/AIC/PHONO_KITTLER.html |accessdate=2007-03-01}}</ref> In 1878 Edison noted that, when played backwards, "the song is still melodious in many cases, and some of the strains are sweet and novel, but altogether different from the song reproduced in the right way".<ref>Blecha, 48</ref> The backwards playing of records was advised as training for magicians by occultist [[Aleister Crowley]], who suggested in his 1913 book ''[[Magick (Book 4)]]'' that an [[adept]] "train himself to think backwards by external means", one of which was to "listen to phonograph records, reversed."<ref>{{cite book |last=Crowley |first=Aleister |authorlink=Aleister Crowley |title=[[Magick (Book 4)]] |origyear=1913 |publisher=Weiser |year=1997 |isbn=0-87728-919-0 |page=648}}</ref>

[[Image:Reel-to-reel recorder tc-630.jpg|thumb|left|[[Tape recorder]]s allowed backward recording in [[recording studio]]s.]]

The 1950s saw two new developments in audio technology: the development of ''[[musique concr<U+00E8>te]]'', an [[avant-garde]] form of [[electronic music]] which involves [[audio engineering|editing]] together fragments of natural and industrial sounds; and the concurrent spread of the use of [[tape recorder]]s in [[recording studio]]s.<ref>{{cite web |last=White |first=Ray |title=Musique Concr<U+00E8>te |url=http://whitefiles.org/rws/rx01.htm |publisher = whitefiles.org | accessdate=2007-11-05}}</ref> These two trends led to tape music compositions, composed on [[magnetic tape|tape]] using techniques including [[reverse tape effects]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Peters |first=Michael |title=The Birth of Loop: A Short History of Looping Music |url=http://www.loopers-delight.com/history/Loophist.html |publisher=loopers-delight.com|accessdate=2007-03-10}}</ref>

[[The Beatles]], who incorporated the techniques of ''concr<U+00E8>te'' into their recordings, were responsible for popularizing the concept of backmasking.<ref name="sullivan" /> Singer [[John Lennon]] and producer [[George Martin]] both claimed they discovered the backward recording technique during the recording of 1966's ''[[Revolver (album)|Revolver]]''; specifically the album tracks "[[Tomorrow Never Knows]]" and "[[I'm Only Sleeping]]," and the single "[[Rain (The Beatles song)|Rain]]".<ref>{{cite news |last=Mugan |first=Chris |title=Subliminal advertising: The voice within |newspaper=The Independent | location = London |date=October 13, 2006 |url=http://arts.independent.co.uk/music/features/article1847509.ece |accessdate=2007-03-10}}</ref> Lennon stated that, while under the influence of [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]], he accidentally played the tapes for "Rain" in reverse, and enjoyed the sound.

===Rumors===
The Beatles were involved in the spread of backmasking both as a recording technique and as the center of a [[controversy]]. The latter has its roots in an event in 1969, when [[WNIC|WKNR-FM]] DJ [[Russ Gibb]] received a phone call from a student at [[Eastern Michigan University]] who identified himself as "Tom". The caller asked Gibb about a rumor that Beatle [[Paul McCartney]] [[Paul is dead|had died]], and claimed that the Beatles song "[[Revolution 9]]" contained a backward message confirming the rumor. Gibb played the song backwards on his turntable, and heard "Turn me on, dead man&nbsp;<U+2026> turn me on, dead man&nbsp;<U+2026> turn me on, dead man<U+2026>" ({{Audio-nohelp|Revolution 9 backwards.ogg|listen}}).<ref name="reeve">{{cite book |last=Reeve |first=Andru J |title=Turn Me On, Dead Man: The Beatles And The "Paul-Is-Dead" Hoax |publisher=AuthorHouse |pages=11<U+2013>13}}</ref> Gibb began telling his listeners about what he called "The Great Cover-up",<ref>{{cite journal |last=Yoakum |first=Jim |title=The Man Who Killed Paul McCartney |journal=[[Gadfly Online|The Gadfly]] |year=2000 |month=May/June |url=http://www.gadflyonline.com/archive/MayJune00/archive-mccartney.html |accessdate=2007-10-12}}</ref> and to the original clue were added various others, including the alleged backmasked message "Paul is a dead man, miss him, miss him, miss him", in "[[I'm So Tired]]".<ref name="reeve" /> The "[[Paul is dead]]" rumor popularized the idea of backmasking in [[popular music]].<ref name="sullivan" />

After Gibb's show, many more songs were found to contain phrases that sounded like known spoken languages when reversed. Initially, the search was done mostly by fans of [[rock music]]; but, in the late 1970s,<ref name = "Blecha_p49">Blecha, 49</ref> during the rise of the [[Christian right]] in the United States,<ref name="nyt">{{cite news|last=Holden |first=Stephen |title=Serious Issues Underlie a New Album from Styx |publisher=New York Times |date=1983-03-27 |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9506E5DF1339F934A15750C0A965948260 |accessdate=2007-03-13}}</ref> [[fundamentalist Christian]] groups began to claim that backmasked messages could bypass the [[Consciousness|conscious mind]] and reach the [[subconscious]], where they would be unknowingly accepted by the listener.<ref name="poundstone86">Poundstone (1986), 227<U+2013>232</ref> In 1981, Christian DJ Michael Mills began stating on Christian radio programs that [[Led Zeppelin]]'s "[[Stairway to Heaven]]" contained hidden messages that were heard by the subconscious.<ref name="davis">{{cite book |editor=David Barker |title=33 1/3 Greatest Hits, Volume One |publisher=Continuum |year=2007 |isbn=0-8264-1903-8 |chapter=Led Zeppelin IV |last=Davis |first=Erik |pages=212<U+2013>214}}</ref> In early 1982, the [[Trinity Broadcasting Network]]'s [[Paul Crouch]] hosted a show with self-described neuroscientist William Yarroll, who argued that rock stars were cooperating with the [[Church of Satan]] to place hidden subliminal messages on records.<ref>Denisoff, 289</ref> Also in 1982, fundamentalist Christian pastor Gary Greenwald held public lectures on dangers of backmasking, along with at least one mass record-smashing.<ref name="devil">{{cite journal |last=Vokey |first=John R. |coauthors=J.

===Legislation===
One result of the furor was the firing of five radio DJs who had encouraged listeners to search for backward messages in their record collections.<ref name = "Blecha_p49"/> A more serious consequence was legislation by the state governments of [[Arkansas]] and [[California]]. The 1983 California bill was introduced to prevent backmasking that "can manipulate our behavior without our knowledge or consent and turn us into disciples of the [[Antichrist]]".<ref>Blecha, 51</ref> Involved in the discussion on the bill was a [[California State Assembly]] Consumer Protection and Toxic Materials Committee hearing, during which "Stairway to Heaven" was played backwards, and William Yaroll testified.<ref>Denisoff, 290</ref> The successful bill made the distribution of records with undeclared backmasking an invasion of privacy for which the distributor could be sued.<ref name="devil" /> The Arkansas law passed unanimously in 1983, referenced albums by [[The Beatles]], [[Pink Floyd]], [[Electric Light Orchestra]], [[Queen (band)|Queen]] and [[Styx]],<ref name="nyt" /> and mandated that records with backmasking include a warning sticker: "Warning: This record contains backward masking which may be perceptible at a subliminal level when the record is played forward." However, the bill was returned to the state senate by Governor [[Bill Clinton]] and defeated.<ref name="devil" /> House Resolution 6363, introduced in 1982 by Representative [[Bob Dornan]] (R-California), proposed mandating a similar label;<ref name="poundstone83">Poundstone (1983), 200<U+2013>214</ref> the bill was referred to the Subcommittee on Commerce, Transportation and Tourism and was never passed.<ref>{{USBill|97|HR|6363}} from [[THOMAS]]</ref> Government action was also called for in the legislatures of Texas and Canada.<ref name="devil" />

[[Image:Compact Disc.jpg|thumb|right|The [[compact disc]] made finding backward messages difficult, causing interest in backmasking to decline.]]

With the advent of [[compact disc]]s in the 1980s, but prior to the advent of sound editing technology for [[personal computer]]s in the 1990s, it became more difficult to listen to recordings backwards, and the controversy died down.<ref name="wsj" />

===Resurgence===
Though the backmasking controversy peaked in the 1980s, the general belief in subliminal manipulation became more widespread in the United States during the following decade,<ref name="brannon" /> with belief in Satanic backmasking on records persisting into the 1990s.<ref>{{cite book |editor=Kenneth J.

==Use==
{{see also|List of backmasked messages}}
[[Image:Digital.signal.svg|thumb|right|The switch to [[digital audio]] made recording backmasked messages quicker and easier.]]

Backmasking has been used as a [[sound recording and reproduction|recording]] technique since the 1960s. In the era of [[magnetic tape sound recording]], backmasking required that the source [[reel-to-reel audio tape recording|reel-to-reel]] tape actually be played backwards, which was achieved by first being wound onto the original takeup reel, then reversing the reels so as to use that reel as the source (this would reverse the stereo channels as well). [[Digital audio]] recording has greatly simplified the process.<ref name="radar" />

Backmasked words are unintelligible noise when played forward, but when played backwards are clear speech.<ref name="robinson" /> Listening to backmasked audio with most [[phonograph|turntables]] requires disengaging the drive and rotating the album by hand in reverse<ref name="seattle" /> (though some can play records backwards<ref name="poundstone86" />). With [[magnetic tape]], the tape must be reversed and spliced back in to the cassette.<ref name="seattle" /> [[Compact disc]]s were difficult to reverse when first introduced, but [[digital audio editor]]s, which were first introduced in the late 1980s and became popular during the next decade,<ref>{{cite journal |title=Portable Digital Audio Workstations (Buyer's Guide) |journal=Theatre Crafts International |date=1997-02-01 |url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/premium/0286/0286-9303362.html |accessdate=2007-06-05}}</ref> allow easy reversal of audio from digital sources.<ref name="wsj" />

===Satanic backmasking===
Although the Satanic backmasking controversy involved mainly [[classic rock]] songs whose authors denied any intent to promote [[Satanism]], backmasking has been used by [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] bands to deliberately insert messages in their lyrics or imagery. Bands have utilized Satanic imagery for commercial reasons.<ref>Blecha, 52</ref> For example, [[thrash metal]] band [[Slayer]] included at the start of the band's 1985 album ''[[Hell Awaits]]'' a deep backmasked voice chanting "Join Us" over and over.({{Audio-nohelp|Hell Awaits backwards.ogg|listen}}).<ref>{{cite web |title=Slayer <U+2013> Hell Awaits |publisher=[[UGO Networks]] |url=http://www.ugo.com/music/backmasked-tracks/?cur=hell-awaits |accessdate=2009-06-13}}</ref> However, Slayer vocalist [[Tom Araya]] states that the band's use of Satanic imagery was "solely for effect".<ref>{{cite web |last=Hellqvist |first=Janek |title=Slayer FAQ |work=Slyer: The Abyss |date=1998-12-03 |publisher=slaytonic.com |url=http://www.slaytanic.com/faq.html |accessdate=2007-04-16 |quote=Interview question: 'Did you adopt the satanic image solely for effect?'

===Aesthetic use===
Backmasking is often used for aesthetics, i.e., to enhance the meaning or sound of a track.<ref name = "Blecha_p49"/> During the [[Judas Priest]] subliminal message trial, lead singer [[Rob Halford]] admitted to recording the words "In the dead of the night, love bites" backwards into the track "Love Bites", from the 1984 album ''[[Defenders of the Faith]]''.

A common use of backmasking is hiding a comedic or parodical message backwards in a song. The [[B-side]] of the 1966 [[Napoleon XIV]] single "[[They're Coming to Take Me Away Ha-Haaa!]]" is a reversed version of the entire forwards record, entitled "!aaaH-aH ,yawA eM ekaT oT gnimoC er'yehT". It reached #3 in the US charts, and #4 in the UK.<ref>{{cite web |title=They're Coming To Take Me Away, Ha-haaa by Napoleon XIV |publisher=Songfacts |url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=675 |accessdate=2007-08-13}}</ref>

[[Pink Floyd]] dropped a backmasked message into "[[Empty Spaces]]":
* ''... Congratulations. You have just discovered the secret message. Please send your answer to Old Pink, care of the Funny Farm, Chalfont...''
* ''Roger! Carolyne's on the phone!''
* ''Okay.''

The first line may refer to former lead singer [[Syd Barrett]], who is thought to have suffered a [[nervous breakdown]] years earlier.<ref name="p186">Patterson, 186</ref>

In [["Weird Al" Yankovic]]'s "[[Nature Trail to Hell]]", from 1984's ''[[In 3-D|"Weird Al" Yankovic in 3-D]]'', Yankovic's backmasked voice declares that "[[Satan]] eats [[Cheez Whiz]]" ({{Audio-nohelp|Nature Trail To Hell backwards.ogg|listen}}).<ref name="wsj" /> Another early example can be found on the [[J. Geils Band]] track "No Anchovies, Please", from 1980s album ''[[Love Stinks]]''. The message, disguised as a foreign-sounding language spoken under the narration, is, "It doesn't take a genius to tell the difference between chicken shit and chicken salad."<ref name="poundstone86" />
Belgian act [[Poesie Noire]] included a satirical backmasked message on their 1988 album Tetra saying "You fucking asshole, play the record in the normal way".<ref>[http://www.poesienoire.com/php/matrix.php?action=listall Po<U+00E9>sie Noire - The Matrix]</ref> [[Tenacious D]] includes the backmasked message "Eat Donkey Crap" at the end of "Karate" from their self-titled first album.<ref>{{cite web |last=Marshall |first=Steve |title=Tenacious D: Tenacious D (Epic) |publisher=The Night Owl |year=2001 |url=http://www.thenightowl.com/reviews/tenacious.htm |accessdate=2009-06-13}}</ref>

[[Electric Light Orchestra]] and [[Styx (band)|Styx]], following their involvement in the 1980s backmasking controversy, released songs that parody the allegations made against them. ELO, after being accused of Satanic backmasking on their 1974 album ''[[Eldorado (ELO album)|Eldorado]]'', included backmasked messages in two songs on their next album, 1975's ''[[Face the Music (Electric Light Orchestra album)|Face The Music]]''.<ref>{{cite web |last=Michel |first=Rob |title=1974: Electric Light Orchestra: Eldorado |work=Counting Out Time |publisher=Dutch Progressive Rock Page |year=2002 |month=August |url=http://www.dprp.net/proghistory/index.php?i=1974_03 |accessdate=2007-03-17}}</ref> "[[Down Home Town]]" begins with a voice twice repeating (in reverse) "Face the mighty waterfall".<ref name="elo">{{cite web |title=Secret Messages |work=My Electric Light Orchestra Fan Site |publisher=FutureBright |url=http://elo.futurebright.com/Secrets.htm |accessdate=2006-07-27}}{{dead link|date=October 2011}}</ref> And the opening instrumental "[[Fire On High]]" contains the backmasked message "The music is reversible, but time is not.

Some messages chastise or poke fun at the listener who is playing the song backwards. One such message was included by "Weird Al" Yankovic in "[[I Remember Larry]]", from the 1996 album ''[[Bad Hair Day]]'', on which Yankovic lightly chastises the listener with the backmasked remark, "Wow, you must have an awful lot of free time on your hands" ({{Audio-nohelp|I Remember Larry backwards.ogg|listen}}).<ref>{{cite web |last=Lick |first=Marty "Gumby" |coauthors="Happy Steve" Chai| title="Weird Al" Yankovic Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Al-oholics Anonymous |url=http://www.al-oholicsanonymous.com/faq/index.html |accessdate=2007-03-17}}</ref> Similarly, the [[The B-52's|B-52's]] song "Detour Through your Mind", from the 1986 LP ''[[Bouncing off the Satellites]]'', contains the message, "I buried my parakeet in the backyard.

Backmasking was also parodied in a 2001 episode of the television series ''[[The Simpsons]]'' entitled "[[New Kids on the Blecch]]." [[Bart Simpson]] joins a [[boy band]] called the Party Posse, whose song "Drop Da Bomb" includes the repeated lyric "Yvan eht nioj." [[Lisa Simpson]] becomes suspicious and plays the song backward, revealing the backmasked message "Join the Navy," which leads her to realize that the boy band was created as a subliminal [[military recruitment|recruiting]] tool for the [[United States Navy]].

===Critical or explicit messages===
[[Image:Zappa.jpg|thumb|right|[[Frank Zappa]] used backmasking to avoid censorship.]]

Backmasking has also been used to record statements perhaps too critical or explicit to be used forwards. Frank Zappa used backmasking to avoid censorship of the track "[[Hot Poop]]," from ''[[We're Only in It for the Money]]'' (1968). The released version contains at the end of its side "A" the backmasked message "Better look around before you say you don't care. / Shut your f...ing<!-- please don't change this to "fucking"<U+2014>the song is itself censored --> mouth 'bout the length of my hair. / How would you survive / If you were alive / shitty little person?" This profanity-laced verse, originally from the song "Mother People", was censored by Verve Records, so Zappa edited the verse out, reversed it, and inserted it elsewhere in the album as "Hot Poop" (though even in the backward message the word "fucking" is censored).<ref>{{cite web |title=We're Only In It for the Money |last=Pacholski |first=Luke |url=http://www.lukpac.org/~handmade/patio/vinylvscds/money.html |publisher=lukpac.org |accessdate=2006-07-29}}</ref> Another example is found in [[Roger Waters]]' 1991 album ''[[Amused to Death]]'', on which Waters recorded a backward message, possibly critical of film director [[Stanley Kubrick]], who had refused to let Waters sample a breathing sound from ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]''.<ref>{{cite web |last=Simon |first=Michael |title=Amused To Death Trivia |publisher=Roger Waters International Fan Club |url=http://www.rogerwaters.org/atdtrivia.html |accessdate=2007-03-17}}</ref> The message appears in the song "[[Perfect Sense Part 1]]", in which Waters' backmasked voice says, "Julia, however, in light and visions of the issues of Stanley, we have changed our minds. We have decided to include a backward message, Stanley, for you and all the other book burners."<ref>{{cite web |title=Roger Waters <U+2013> Perfect Sense |publisher=[[UGO Networks]] |url=http://www.ugo.com/music/backmasked-tracks/?cur=perfect-sense |accessdate=2009-06-13}}</ref>

===Censorship===
A further use of backmasking is to [[censorship|censor]] words and phrases deemed inappropriate on [[radio edit]]s and "[[wikt:clean|clean]]" album releases.<ref name="nelson">{{cite web |last=Nelson |first=Chris |title=Sticker Ban Policy: Family Values Or Consumer Fraud? |publisher=[[VH1]] |date=1998-09-08 |url=http://www.vh1.com/news/articles/501064/19980908/story.jhtml |accessdate=2007-02-03}}</ref> For example, [[The Fugees]]' clean version of the album ''[[The Score (album)|The Score]]'' contains various backmasked [[profanity|profanities]];<ref name="nelson" /> thus, when playing the album backwards, the censored words are clearly audible among the backward gibberish.<ref>{{cite web |author=mcc |publisher=[[Everything2]] |title=Music that sounds better backward than forward |url=http://everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=677630 |accessdate=2006-08-26}}</ref> When used with the word "shit", this type of backmasking results in a sound similar to "ish". As a result, "[[wikt:ish|ish]]" became a [[euphemism]] for "shit".<ref>{{cite web |last=Rader |first=Walter |title=The Online Slang Dictionary |coauthors=David |date=2002-12-22 |publisher=University of California at Berkeley |url=http://onlineslangdictionary.com/definition+of/ish |accessdate=2007-04-16}}</ref>

In [[Britney Spears]]' 2011 song "[[Till The World Ends]]", Spears says "if you want this good shit". However, on the official version, "shit" is reversed, creating the "ish" sound; therefore, the official version says "if you want this good ish". Backmasking is also used to censor the word "[[joint (cannabis)|joint]]" in the video for "[[You Don't Know How It Feels]]" by [[Tom Petty]], resulting in the line "Let's roll another tnioj".<ref name="TomPettySun">{{cite web

[[Electric Light Orchestra]] was accused of hiding a backward Satanic message in their 1974 album ''[[Eldorado (ELO album)|Eldorado]]''. The title track, "[[Eldorado (Electric Light Orchestra song)|Eldorado]]", was said to contain the message "He is the nasty one / Christ, you're infernal / It is said we're dead men / Everyone who has the mark will live."<ref name="poundstone83" /> ELO singer and songwriter [[Jeff Lynne]] responded by calling this accusation (and the related charge of being "devil-worshippers") "[[bollocks|skcollob]]",<ref name="ftm">{{cite web |title=Electric Light Orchestra Biogs |publisher=Face The Music |url=http://www.ftmusic.com/biogs/elo/elo_biog.html |accessdate=2007-03-14}}</ref> and stating that the message "is absolutely manufactured by whoever said, 'That's what it said.' It doesn't say anything of the sort."<ref name = "Patterson__p174"/> The group included several backward messages in later albums in response to the accusations.

In 1981, [[Styx (band)|Styx]] was accused of putting the backward message "Satan move through our voices" ({{Audio-nohelp|Snowblind backwards.ogg|listen}}) on the song "[[Snowblind (Styx song)|Snowblind]]," from ''[[Paradise Theater (album)|Paradise Theatre]]''.<ref name="nyt" /> Guitarist [[James Young (American musician)|James Young]] called these charges "rubbish,"<ref name="arar">{{cite news |last=Arar |first=Yardena |title=Satanic records or balderdash: Just what the devil's going on? |newspaper=The Daily Herald | location = Arlington Heights, IL |date=May 26, 1982 }}</ref> and responded, "If we want to make a statement, we'll do it in a way that people can understand us and not in a way where you have to go out and buy a $400 tape player to understand us."<ref name="kilroy">{{cite news |last=Hoekstra |first=Dave |title=Styx makes a statement |newspaper=Suburban Sun-Times | location = Chicago |date=April 1, 1983 }}</ref> In 1983, the band released a concept album, ''[[Kilroy Was Here (album)|Kilroy Was Here]]'', satirizing the [[Moral Majority]].

A well-known alleged message is found in rock group [[Led Zeppelin]]'s 1971 song "[[Stairway to Heaven]]." The backwards playing of a portion of the song purportedly results in words beginning with "Here's to my sweet Satan" ({{Audio-nohelp|STH reverse.ogg|listen}}).<ref name="milner">{{cite web |last=Milner |first=Jeff |title=Jeff Milner's Backmasking Site |url=http://jeffmilner.com/backmasking.htm |publisher = jeffmilner.com |accessdate=2007-03-14}}</ref> But [[Swan Song Records]] issued a statement to the contrary: "Our turntables only play in one direction<U+2014>forwards".<ref name="davis" /> And Led Zeppelin vocalist [[Robert Plant]] denied the accusations in an interview: "To me it's very sad, because 'Stairway To Heaven' was written with every best intention, and as far as reversing tapes and putting messages on the end, that's not my idea of making music."<ref>{{cite interview |last=Plant |first=Robert |subjectlink=Robert Plant |interviewer=J.D.

===Subliminal persuasion===
{{further2|[[Subliminal message]]}}

====Fundamentalist Christian groups====
Various [[fundamentalist Christian]] groups have declared that Satan<U+2014>or Satan-influenced musicians<U+2014>use backmasked messages to subliminally alter behavior. Pastor Gary Greenwald claimed that subliminal messages backmasked into rock music induce listeners towards sex and drug use.<ref>Vokey, 258</ref> Minister Jacob Aranza wrote in his 1982 book ''Backward Masking Unmasked'' that rock groups "are using backmasking to convey satanic and drug related messages to the subconscious."<ref name = "Blecha_p49"/> Christian DJ Michael Mills argued in 1981 that "the subconscious mind is being successfully affected by the repetition of beat and lyrics<U+2014>being affected through a subliminal message."<ref>Mills, Michael.

Some Christian websites have claimed that backmasking is widely used for Satanic purposes.<ref name="robinson" /> The web page for Alabama group [[Dial-the-Truth Ministries]] argues for the existence of Satanic backmasking in "[[Stairway to Heaven]]," saying that the song contains the backward message, "It's my sweet Satan ... Oh I will sing because I live with Satan."<ref name="watkins" />

====PMRC====
In 1985, Dr. Joe Stuessy testified to the [[United States Congress]] at the [[Parents Music Resource Center]] hearings that:
<blockquote>
The message [of a piece of heavy metal music] may also be covert or subliminal. Sometimes subaudible tracks are mixed in underneath other, louder tracks. These are heard by the subconscious but not the conscious mind. Sometimes the messages are audible but are backward, called backmasking. There is disagreement among experts regarding the effectiveness of subliminals. We need more research on that.<ref name="pmrc">United States Senate (1985). [http://www.joesapt.net/superlink/shrg99-529/ Record Labeling: Hearing before the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation].

Available at Joesapt.net. Retrieved 2007-06-09.</ref>
</blockquote>
Stuessy's written testimony stated that:
<blockquote>
Some messages are presented to the listener backwards. While listening to a normal forward message (often somewhat nonsensical), one is simultaneously being treated to a backwards message (in other words, the lyric sounds like one set of words going forward, and a different set of words going backwards). Some experts believe that while the conscious mind is absorbing the forward lyric, the subconscious is working overtime to decipher the backwards message.<ref name="pmrc" />

In 1990, British [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band [[Judas Priest]] was sued over a [[suicide pact]] made by two young men in [[Nevada]]. The lawsuit by their families claimed that the 1978 Judas Priest album ''[[Stained Class]]'' contained hidden messages, including the forward subliminal words "Do it" in the song "[[Better By You, Better Than Me]]" (a cover version of a [[Spooky Tooth]] song), and various backward subliminal messages. The case was dismissed by the judge for insufficient evidence of Judas Priest's placement of subliminal messages on the record,<ref>Vokey, 261</ref> and the judge's ruling stated that "The scientific research presented does not establish that subliminal stimuli, even if perceived, may precipitate conduct of this magnitude. There exist other factors which explain the conduct of the deceased independent of the subliminal stimuli."<ref>{{cite web |last=Sophia |first=Cassiel |title=Subliminal Suicide? |publisher=Metareligion |url=http://www.meta-religion.com/Secret_societies/Conspiracies/Mind_Control/subliminal_suicide.htm |accessdate=2007-03-17}}</ref> Judas Priest members commented that if they wanted to insert subliminal commands in their music, messages leading to the deaths of their fans would be counterproductive, and they would prefer to insert the command "Buy more of our records."<ref>Van Taylor, David.

===Skepticism===
[[Skepticism|Skeptic]] [[Michael Shermer]] claims that the emergence of the "[[Paul is dead]]" phenomenon, including the alleged message at the end of "[[I'm So Tired]]", was caused by faulty perception of a pattern. Shermer argues that the human brain evolved with a strong [[pattern recognition]] ability that was necessary to process the large amount of [[noise]] in man's environment, but that today this ability leads to [[false positive]]s.<ref>{{cite news |last=Shermer |first=Michael |title=Turn Me On, Dead Man |year=2005 |month=May |work =Scientific American |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=turn-me-on-dead-man|accessdate=2012-01-25}}</ref> [[Stanford University]] psychology professor Brian Wandell postulates that the observance of backward messages is a mistake arising from this pattern recognition facility, and argues that subliminal persuasion theories are "bizarre" and "implausible."<ref name="seattle">{{cite news |last=Holguin |first=Jaime |title=Backmasking unmasked!

Audio engineer Evan Olcott claims that messages by artists including Queen and Led Zeppelin are coincidental [[phonetic reversal]]s, in which the spoken or sung [[phoneme]]s form new combinations of words when listened to backwards.<ref name="ev" /> Olcott states that "Actually engineering or planning a phonetic reversal is next to impossible, and even more difficult when trying to design it with words that fit into a song."<ref name="ev2" />

In 1985, University of Lethbridge psychologists John Vokey and J. Don Read conducted a study using [[Psalm 23]] from the [[Bible]], [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s "[[Another One Bites the Dust]]", and other sound passages made up for the experiment. Vokey and Read concluded that if backmasking does exist, it is ineffective. Participants had trouble noticing backmasked phrases when the samples were played forwards, were unable to judge the types of messages (Christian, Satanic, or commercial), and were not led to behave in a certain way as a result of being exposed to the backmasked phrases. Vokey concluded that "we could find no effect of the meaning of engineered, backward messages on listeners' behaviour, either consciously or unconsciously."<ref>Vokey, 260</ref> Similar results to Vokey and Read's were obtained by D.

The finding of backward Satanic messages has been explained as caused by the [[observer-expectancy effect]]. The ''[[Skeptic's Dictionary]]'' states that "you probably won't hear [backmasked] messages until somebody first points them out to you. Perception is influenced by expectation and expectation is affected by what others prime you for."<ref>{{cite web |last=Carroll |first=Robert Todd |authorlink=Robert Todd Carroll |title=backwards satanic messages (backmasking) |work=The [[Skeptic's Dictionary]] |date=December 28, 2006 |url=http://www.skepdic.com/backward.html |accessdate=2007-04-18}}</ref> In 1984, S. B. Thorne and P. Himelstein found that "when vague and unfamiliar stimuli are presented, [test subjects] are highly likely to accept suggestions, particularly when the suggestions are presented by someone with prestige and authority."<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Thorne |first1=Stephen B. |first2 =Philip | last2 = Himelstein |year=1984 |title=The role of suggestion in the perception of Satanic messages on rock-and-role recordings |journal=Journal of Psychology |pages=245<U+2013>248}} Cited in {{cite book |last=Hicks |first=Robert D. |title=In Pursuit of Satan: The Police And the Occult |publisher=Prometheus |year=1991 | location = Buffalo, NY |isbn=1-59102-219-3 |page=306}}</ref> Vokey and Read concluded from their 1985 experiment that "the apparent presence of backward messages in popular music is a function more of active construction on the part of the perceiver than of the existence of the messages themselves."<ref name="devil" />
