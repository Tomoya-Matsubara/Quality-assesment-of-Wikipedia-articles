The '''1987 Atlantic hurricane season''' was an average [[List of Atlantic hurricane seasons|Atlantic hurricane season]] that was limited by an ongoing [[El Ni<U+00F1>o]]. The first tropical depression of the season developed on [[May 25]], prior to the official start of the season on [[June 1]]; the last cyclone dissipated on [[November 14]]. The season marked the first year [[tropical cyclone warnings and watches|tropical storm watches and warnings]] were issued; previously, gale watches and warnings were used for tropical storms. 

With fourteen tropical cyclones, of which seven attained tropical storm status, the season was relatively quiet, and was somewhat unusual in that there were no United States deaths.<ref name="1987 Annual Summary">

Forecasts of hurricane activity are issued before each hurricane season by noted hurricane experts like Dr. [[William M. Gray]], and his associates at [[Colorado State University]]. A normal season, as defined by NOAA, has 6 to 14 named storms, with 4 to 8 of those reaching hurricane strength, and 1 to 3 major hurricanes. The [[June 2]], [[1987]] report suggested that eight tropical storms would form during the 1987 season, five of them becoming hurricanes.<ref name="Seasonalforecasters">

The table on the right shows the [[Accumulated Cyclone Energy|ACE]] for each storm in the season. ACE is, broadly speaking, a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed, so storms that last a long time, as well as particularly strong hurricanes, have high ACEs. ACE is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 34&nbsp;knots (39&nbsp;mph, 63&nbsp;km/h) or tropical storm strength.

==Storm names==
The following names were used for named storms that formed in the north Atlantic in 1987. This is the same list used for the [[1981 Atlantic hurricane season|1981 season]]. No names were retired, so it was used again in the [[1993 Atlantic hurricane season|1993 season]]. Names that were not assigned are marked in {{tcname unused}}.
