'''Cricket''' is a [[team sport]] played between two teams of eleven players on each team. It is a bat-and-ball game played on a roughly elliptical grass field, in the centre of which is a flat strip of ground 22&nbsp;[[yard]]s (20.12&nbsp;[[Metre|m]]) long, called a [[Cricket pitch|pitch]].  At each end of the pitch is a set of wooden stumps, called a [[wicket]].
A player from the fielding team (the [[bowler (cricket)|bowler]]) propels a hard, fist-sized leather [[cricket ball|ball]] from one wicket towards the other, where a player from the opposing team (the [[batsman]]) defends the wicket from the ball with a wooden [[cricket bat]].  Another batsman (the "non-striker") stands in an inactive role near the bowler's wicket. 

Generally, the batsman attempts to strike the ball with the bat, and run to the other end, exchanging places with his partner, scoring a [[run (cricket)|run]]. However, he can attempt to run without hitting the ball, and vice versa. While the batting team scores as many runs as it can, the bowling team returns the ball back to either wicket. If the ball strikes a [[wicket]] before the batsman nearer to that wicket has reached safety, then the batsman is [[dismissal (cricket)|out]], or "dismissed". The batsman can also be out by failing to stop the [[bowling (cricket)|bowled]] ball from hitting the wicket, or if a fielder [[caught|catches]] the ball before it touches the ground. Once the batsmen are not attempting to score any more runs, the ball is "dead" and is bowled again.

Once out, a batsman is replaced by the next batsman in the team. As there must always be two batsmen on the field, the team's ''innings'' ends when ten batsmen are out, and the teams exchange roles. The number of innings, and possible restrictions on the number of balls in each, depend on the type of game played. At the end of the match - of which there are several definitions - the team that has scored more runs wins. In first-class cricket, [[The result in cricket#Draw|a ''draw'']] can result if the team to bat last fails to match the required total before a time limit is reached. This can add interest to one-sided games by giving the team in the worse position an incentive to play for a draw. This is distinct from a ''tie'', which results if scores are level at the completion of both teams' innings.

Cricket has been an established team sport for several centuries. It originated in its modern form in [[England]] and is popular mainly in the present and former members of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]]. In some countries in [[South Asia]], including [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Bangladesh]], and [[Sri Lanka]], cricket is by far the most popular sport. Cricket is also a major sport in England and [[Wales]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[South Africa]], [[Zimbabwe]] and the [[English language|English]]-speaking countries of the [[Caribbean]], which are collectively known in cricketing parlance as the [[West Indian cricket team|West Indies]]. There are also well established amateur club competitions in countries as diverse as the [[Netherlands]], [[Kenya]], [[Nepal]], and [[Argentina]] (see also: [[International Cricket Council]]).

The [[Playing time (cricket)|length of the game]] <U+2014> a match can last six or more hours a day for up to five days in one form of the game <U+2014> the numerous [[Playing time (cricket)|intervals]] for lunch and [[tea_(meal)|tea]], and the rich [[Cricket terminology|terminology]] are notable aspects that can often confuse those not familiar with the sport. For its fans, the sport and the intense rivalries between top cricketing nations provide passionate entertainment and outstanding sporting achievements. It has even occasionally given rise to [[Diplomacy|diplomatic]] outrage, the most notorious being the [[Bodyline]] series played between [[English cricket team|England]] and [[Australian cricket team|Australia]] in the early 1930s, or the [[1981 underarm bowling incident]] involving Australia and [[New Zealand cricket team|New Zealand]]..

==Objective and results==
<!--Contributors, please note: In cricket, innings is both singular and plural.  Do not use "inning" in this article-->
<!--[[Image:Bradford-Leeds_UCCE_beat_Surrey.JPG|thumb|Action at the centre of the ground.]]-->
Cricket is a [[cricket bat|bat]] and [[cricket ball|ball]] sport. The objective of the game is to score more ''[[run (cricket)|runs]]'' than the opposing team. A match is divided into [[innings]] during which one team bats and one team fields.  The word "innings" is both singular and plural in cricket usage.

<!--Note that cricket ALWAYS uses the term "innings" and NEVER "inning" - see [[innings]]. -->
If the team batting last is dismissed while their total score is ''n'' runs less than that of their opponents, they are said to have lost by ''n runs''. If, in a two-innings match, one team is dismissed twice with a combined first- and second-innings score less than their opponents' first-innings score, then the winning team has no requirement to bat again and they are said to have won by ''an innings and n runs'', where ''n'' is the difference in score between the teams.  If the team batting last is dismissed with the scores exactly equal then the match is a [[The result in cricket#Tie|tie]]; a tie is a rare result, particularly in matches of two innings a side.  If the team batting last reaches their target, they are said to have won by ''n wickets'', where ''n'' is the number of wickets the opposition still needed to take in order to dismiss them. If the time allotted for the match finishes before either side can win, then the game is [[The result in cricket#Draw|a draw]].

If the match has only a single innings per side then a maximum number of deliveries for each innings is often imposed.  In this case the side scoring more runs wins regardless of the number of wickets lost, so that a draw cannot occur.  If this kind of match is temporarily interrupted by bad weather, then a complex mathematical formula known as the [[Duckworth-Lewis method]] is often used to recalculate a new target score.  A one-day match can be declared a "No-Result" if fewer than a previously agreed number of overs have been bowled by either team.  This can occur if an interruption makes a resumption of play impossible, for example an extended period of bad weather.

==Laws of cricket==
<!--Contributors, please note: In cricket, innings is both singular and plural.  Do not use "inning" in this article-->
{{see details|Laws of cricket}}
The game is played in accordance with 42 laws of cricket, which have been developed by the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] in discussion with the main cricketing nations. Teams may agree to alter some of the rules for particular games. Other rules supplement the main laws and change them to deal with different circumstances. In particular, there are a number of modifications to the playing structure and fielding position rules that apply to one innings games that are restricted to a set number of fair deliveries. 

===Players and officials===
====Players====
{{see details|Cricketer}} 
A team consists of eleven players. Depending on his primary skills, a player may be classified as a specialist ''[[batsman]]'' or ''[[bowler (cricket)|bowler]]''. A balanced team usually has five or six specialist batsmen and four or five specialist bowlers. Teams nearly always include a specialist ''[[wicket-keeper]]'' because of the importance of this fielding position.

A player who excels in both batting and bowling is known as an ''[[all-rounder]]''. One who excels as a batsman and wicket-keeper is known as a ''wicket-keeper/batsman'', sometimes regarded as a type of all-rounder. True all-rounders are rare and valued.

====Umpires====
{{see details|Umpire (cricket)}}
Two on-field ''umpires'' preside over a match. One umpire will stand behind the [[#The playing field|wicket]] at the end from which the ball is bowled, and adjudicate on most decisions. The other will stand near the fielding position called [[Fielding positions in cricket|square leg]], which offers a side view of the batsman, and assist on decisions for which he has a better view. In some professional matches, they may refer a decision to an off-field [[third umpire|'third' umpire]], who has the assistance of television replays. In international matches an off-field [[match referee (Cricket)|match referee]] ensures that play is within the [[laws of cricket]] and the spirit of the game.

====Scorers====
{{see details|Scorer}}
Two ''scorers'' are appointed, and most often one scorer is provided by each team.  The laws of cricket specify that the official scorers are to record all runs scored, wickets taken and (where appropriate) overs bowled.  They are to acknowledge signals from the umpire, and to check the accuracy of the score regularly both with each other and, at playing intervals, with the umpires.  In practice scorers also keep track of other matters, such as bowlers' analyses, the rate at which the teams bowl their overs, and team statistics such as averages and records.  In international and national cricket competitions the media often require notification of records and statistics, so unofficial scorers often keep tally for the broadcast commentators and newspaper journalists.  The official scorers occasionally make mistakes, but unlike umpires' mistakes these can be corrected after the event.

|-
| [[Image:Cricket pitch.svg|right|thumb|200px|The Cricket pitch dimensions]]
|}
The cricket field consists of a large [[circle|circular]] or [[oval]]-shaped [[Lawn|grassy]] ground. There are no fixed dimensions for the field but its [[diameter]] usually varies between 450&nbsp;[[foot|feet]] (137&nbsp;m) to 500&nbsp;feet (150&nbsp;m). On most grounds, a [[rope]] demarcates the perimeter of the field and is known as the ''[[boundary (cricket)|boundary]]''. 

; '''The pitch'''
{{see details|Cricket pitch}}

Most of the action takes place in the centre of this ground, on a rectangular clay strip usually with short grass called the '''pitch'''. The pitch measures 10&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;66&nbsp;feet (3.05&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;20.12&nbsp;m).

At each end of the pitch three upright wooden stakes, called the ''[[stump (cricket)|stumps]]'', are hammered into the ground. Two wooden crosspieces, known as the ''[[bail (cricket)|bails]]'', sit in grooves atop the stumps, linking each to its neighbour. Each set of three stumps and two bails is collectively known as a '''[[wicket (cricket)|wicket]]'''. One end of the pitch is designated the ''batting end'' where the [[batsman]] stands and the other is designated the ''bowling end'' where the [[bowler (cricket)|bowler]] runs in to bowl.  The area of the field on the side of the line joining the wickets where the batsman holds his bat (the right-hand side for a right-handed batsman, the left for a left-hander) is known as the ''off side'', the other as the ''leg side'' or ''on side''.

Lines drawn or painted on the pitch are known as '''[[Crease (cricket)|creases]]'''. Creases are used to adjudicate the [[dismissal (cricket)|dismissals of batsmen]] and to determine whether a delivery is fair.

; '''Parts of the field'''

For a one-innings match played over a set number of fair deliveries, there are two additional field markings. A painted oval is made by drawing a semicircle of 30&nbsp;yards (27.4&nbsp;m) radius from the centre of each wicket with respect to the breadth of the pitch and joining them with lines [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel]], 30 yards (27.4&nbsp;m) to the length of the pitch. This line, commonly known as ''the circle'', divides the field into an ''infield'' and ''outfield''. Two circles of radius 15&nbsp;[[yard]]s (13.7&nbsp;m), centred on each wicket and often marked by dots, define the ''close-infield''. The infield, outfield, and the close-infield are used to enforce [[fielding restrictions (cricket)|fielding restrictions]].

; '''Placements of players'''
{{see details|Fielding positions in cricket|Fielding positions}}

The team batting always has two batsmen on the field. One batsman, known as the ''striker'', faces and plays the balls bowled by the bowler. His partner stands at the bowling end and is known as the ''non-striker''. 

The fielding team has all eleven of its players on the ground, and at any particular time, one of these will be the bowler. The player designated as [[Bowler (cricket)|bowler]] must change after every [[Over (cricket)|over]]. The [[wicket-keeper]], who generally acts in that role for the whole match, stands or crouches behind the wicket at the batting end. The captain of the fielding team spreads his remaining nine players <U+2014> the [[fielder]]s <U+2014> around the ground to cover most of the area. Their placement may vary dramatically depending on strategy. Each position on the field has a [[fielding positions in cricket|unique label]].

===Match structure===
<!--Contributors, please note: In cricket, [[innings]] is both singular and plural.  Do not use "inning" in this article-->
; '''The toss'''
{{see details|toss (cricket)}}

On the day of the match, the captains inspect the pitch to determine the type of bowlers whose bowling would be suited for the offered pitch surface and select their eleven players. The two opposing captains then toss a coin. The captain winning the toss may choose either to bat or bowl first.

; '''Overs'''
{{see details|Over (cricket)|Overs}}
Each innings is divided into ''[[over (cricket)|overs]]'', each consisting of six consecutive legal (see "[[#Extras|Extras]]" for details) deliveries bowled by the same [[bowler (cricket)|bowler]]. After completing an over, the bowler must take up a fielding position and let another player take over the bowling.

After every over, the batting and bowling ends are swapped, and the field positions are adjusted. The umpires swap so the umpire at the bowler's end moves to square leg, and the umpire at square leg moves to the new bowler's end.

; '''End of an innings'''
{{see details|End of an innings (Cricket)|End of an innings}}

An innings is completed if:
# Ten out of eleven batsmen are 'out' (''dismissed'').
# A team chasing a given target number of runs to win manages to do so.
# The predetermined number of overs are bowled (in a one-day match only, usually 50 overs).
# A captain ''declares'' his team's innings closed (this does not apply to one-day limited over matches).

; '''Playing time'''
{{see details|Playing time (cricket)|Playing time}}

Typically, two innings matches are played over three to five days with at least six hours of cricket being played each day. One innings matches are usually played over one day for six hours or more. There are formal intervals on each day for lunch and tea, and shorter breaks for drinks, where necessary. There is also a short interval between innings.

The game is only played in dry weather. Additionally, as in professional cricket it is common for balls to be bowled at over 90&nbsp;[[miles per hour|mph]] (144&nbsp;[[kilometres per hour|km/h]]), the game needs to be played in daylight that is good enough for a batsman to be able to see the ball. Play is therefore halted during rain (but not usually drizzle) and when there is bad light. Some one-day games are now played under floodlights, but, apart from a few experimental games in Australia, floodlights are not used in longer games. Professional cricket is ''usually'' played outdoors. These requirements mean that in England, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and Zimbabwe the game is usually played in the summer. In the West Indies, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh games are played in the winter. In these countries the [[hurricane]] and [[cyclone]] season coincides with their summers.

===Batting and scoring runs===
''See also'': [[Scoring (cricket)|Scoring]]
;'''Batting'''
:''Main articles: [[Batsman]], [[Batting (cricket)|Batting]]''
[[Image:cricket shots.svg|right|thumb|200px|The directions in which a right handed [[batsman]] intends to send the ball when playing various cricketing shots.]]
'''Batsmen''' strike the ball from the batting crease, with the flat surface of a wooden [[cricket bat|bat]]. If the batsman hits the ball with his bat, it is called a ''shot'' (or ''stroke''). If the ball brushes the side of the bat it is called an ''edge'' or ''snick''. Shots are named according to the style of swing and the direction aimed. As part of the team's strategy, he may bat defensively, blocking the ball downwards, or aggressively, hitting the ball hard to empty spaces in order to score runs. There is no requirement to run if the ball is struck.

Batsmen come in to bat in a ''[[batting order (cricket)|batting order]]'', decided by the team captain. The first two positions, the "openers", face the most hostile bowling, from fast bowlers at their freshest and with a new ball. After that, the team typically bats in descending order of batting skill, the first five or six batsmen usually being the best in the team. Then follow the all-rounders - bowlers or wicket-keepers who can bat decently - and finally the pure bowlers who rarely score well. This order may be changed at any time during the course of the game for strategic reasons.

;'''Run scoring'''
{{see details|Run (cricket)|Run}}

To score a '''run''', a striker must hit the ball and run to the opposite end of the pitch, while his non-striking partner runs to his end. Both runners must touch the ground behind the popping crease with either his bat or his body to register a run. If the striker hits the ball well enough, the batsmen may double back to score two or more runs. This is known as ''running between wickets''. However, no rule exists whereby the batmsan ''has'' to run upon striking the ball. If the batsmen score an odd number of runs, then they will have swapped ends and their  roles as striker and non-striker will be reversed for the next ball, unless the most recent ball marks the end of an over. 

If a fielder knocks the bails off the stumps with the ball while no batsman is grounded behind the nearest popping crease, the nearest batsman is ''[[run out]]''. If the ball goes over the [[Boundary (cricket)|boundary]], then four runs are scored, or six if the ball has not bounced. 

;<span id=Extras style="font-weight: bold">Extras</span>
{{see details|Extra (cricket)|Extras}}

Every run scored by the batsmen contributes to the team's total. A team's total also includes a number of runs which are unaccredited to any batsmen. These runs are known as '''extras''', apart from in Australia where they are also called ''sundries''. Extras consist of [[bye (cricket)|bye]]s, [[leg bye]]s, [[no ball]]s, [[wide (cricket)|wides]] and penalty runs. The former two are runs that can be scored if the batsman misses making contact with bat and ball, and the latter two are types of fouls committed by the bowler. For serious infractions such as tampering with the ball, deliberate time-wasting, and damaging the pitch, the umpires may award ''penalty extras'' to the opposition; in each case five runs. Five penalty runs are also awarded if a fielder uses anything other than his body to field the ball, or if the ball hits a protective helmet left on the field by the fielding team. A team need not be batting in order to receive penalty extras.

===Bowling and dismissals===
;'''Bowling'''

[[Image:Darren_Gough_bowling.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Darren Gough]] bowling]] 

:''Main articles: [[Bowler (cricket)|Bowlers]], [[Bowling (cricket)|Bowling]], [[Bowling strategy (cricket)|Bowling strategy]]''

A '''bowler''' delivers the ball toward the batsmen, using what is known as a bowling action: the elbow may be held at any angle and may bend further, but may not straighten out during the action. If the elbow straightens, it is an illegal throw and the delivery is called a ''no-ball''. Under new cricketing law, after consultation with health experts, the bowler is allowed to straighten his arm 15 degrees or less, if the bowler straightens his or her arm more than 15 degrees it is called a "no ball". This new law came in to prevent injury to bowlers. Usually, the bowler pitches the ball so that it bounces before reaching the batsman. Some part of the bowler's front foot in the delivery stride (that is, the stride when the ball is released) must be behind the [[popping crease]] to avoid a ''no-ball'' (although the bowler's front foot does not have to be grounded). The ball must also be delivered so it is within the batsman's reach, otherwise it is termed a ''wide''. A ''wide'' cannot be called if the batsman hits the ball. A ''wide'' or ''no-ball'' results in an extra run being added to the batting team's score, and an extra ball being bowled in the over.

The bowler's primary goal is to take ''wickets''; that is, to get a batsman ''out'' or ''dismissed''. If a bowler can dismiss the more accomplished batsmen on the opposing team he reduces the opportunity for them to score, as it exposes the less skilful batsmen. Their next task is to limit the numbers of runs scored per over they bowl. This is known as the ''Economy rate''. If a bowler gets a batsman out, he is credited for this achievement. There are [[Types of bowlers in cricket|two main kinds of bowlers]]: [[fast bowling|pace bowlers]] and [[spin bowling|spin bowlers]]. 

;'''Dismissal of a batsman'''
{{see details|Dismissal (cricket)|Dismissal}}

A batsman is allowed to bat as long as he does not get ''out'' (also known as being ''dismissed''). There are ten ways of being dismissed, some of which are credited as wickets to the bowler, some of which are not credited to any player. If the batsman is dismissed, another player from the batting team replaces him until ten batsmen are out and the innings is over.

Many modes of dismissal require the wicket to be "put down". The wicket is put down if a bail is dislodged from the top of the stumps or a stump is struck out of the ground either by the ball, or by a fielder using his hand which is holding the ball. Of the following ten modes of dismissal, the first six are common, while the last four are technicalities which rarely occur. Briefly, the ten modes are:

* '''[[Caught]]''' <U+2014> When a fielder catches the ball before the ball bounces and after the batsman has struck it with the bat or it has come into contact with the batsman's glove while it is in contact with the bat handle.  The bowler and catcher are both credited. ([http://www.lords.org/laws-and-spirit/laws-of-cricket/laws/law-32-caught,58,AR.html Law 32])
* '''[[Bowled]]''' <U+2014> When a delivered ball hits the stumps at the batsman's end, and dislodges one or both of the bails. This happens regardless of whether the batsman has edged the ball onto the stumps or not. The bowler is credited with the dismissal. ([http://www.lords.org/laws-and-spirit/laws-of-cricket/laws/law-30-bowled,56,AR.html Law 30])
* '''[[Leg before wicket]] (LBW)''' <U+2014> When a delivered ball misses the bat and strikes the batsman's leg or pad, and the umpire judges that the ball would otherwise have struck the stumps.  The laws of cricket stipulate certain exceptions in favour of the batsman; for instance, a batsman should not be given out LBW if the place where the ball bounced on the pitch is to the leg-side of the area strictly between the two wickets.  The bowler is credited with the dismissal.
* '''[[Run out]]''' <U+2014> When a fielder, bowler or wicket-keeper removes one or both of the bails with the ball by hitting the stumps whilst a batsman is still running between the two ends. The ball can either hit the stumps directly or the fielder's hand with the ball inside it can be used to dislodge the bails. Such a dismissal is not officially credited to any player, although the identities of the fielder or fielders involved is often noted in brackets on the scorecard. 
* '''[[Stump (cricket)#Manner of dismissing a batsman|Stumped]]''' <U+2014> When the batsman leaves his crease in playing a delivery, voluntarily or involuntarily, but the ball goes to the wicket-keeper who uses it to remove one or both of the bails through hitting the bail(s) or the wicket before the batsman has remade his ground.  The bowler and wicket-keeper are both credited.  This generally requires the keeper to be standing within arm's length of the wicket, which is done mainly to [[spin bowling]].  ([http://www.lords.org/laws-and-spirit/laws-of-cricket/laws/law-39-stumped,65,AR.html Law 39])
* '''[[Hit wicket]]''' <U+2014> When the batsman accidentally knocks the stumps with either the body or the bat, causing one or both of the bails to be dislodged, either in playing a shot or in taking off for the first run.  The bowler is credited with the dismissal. ([http://www.lords.org/laws-and-spirit/laws-of-cricket/laws/law-35-hit-wicket,61,AR.html Law 35])
* '''[[Handled the ball]]''' <U+2014> When the batsman deliberately handles the ball without the permission of the fielding team.  No player is credited with the dismissal. ([http://www.lords.org/laws-and-spirit/laws-of-cricket/laws/law-33-handled-the-ball,59,AR.html Law 33])
* '''[[Hit the ball twice]]''' <U+2014> When the batsman deliberately strikes the ball a second time, except for the sole purpose of guarding his wicket.  No player is credited with the dismissal. ([http://www.lords.org/laws-and-spirit/laws-of-cricket/laws/law-34-hit-the-ball-twice,60,AR.html Law 34])
* '''[[Obstructing the field]]''' <U+2014> When a batsman deliberately hinders a fielder from attempting to field the ball. No player is credited with the dismissal. ([http://www.lords.org/laws-and-spirit/laws-of-cricket/laws/law-37-obstructing-the-field,63,AR.html Law 37])
* '''[[Timed out]]''' <U+2014> When a new batsman takes more than three minutes to take his position in the field to replace a dismissed batsman. (If the delay is protracted, the umpires may cause the match to be forfeited.)   No player is credited with the dismissal. ([http://www.lords.org/laws-and-spirit/laws-of-cricket/laws/law-31-timed-out,57,AR.html Law 31])

Additionally, a batsman may leave the field without being dismissed. For instance, if he is injured or taken ill, this is known as ''[[Substitute|retired hurt]]'' or ''[[Substitute|retired ill]]''. The batsman is not out; he may return to bat later in the same innings if sufficiently recovered. Also, an unimpaired batsman may retire, in which case he is treated as being dismissed '''[[retired out]]'''; no player is credited with the dismissal.

An individual cannot be out <U+2014> 'bowled', 'caught', 'leg before wicket', 'stumped', or 'hit wicket' off a ''no ball''. He cannot be out <U+2014> 'bowled', 'caught', 'leg before wicket', or 'hit the ball twice' off a ''wide''.

Some of these modes of dismissal can take place without the bowler bowling a delivery.  The batsman who is not on strike may be run out by the bowler if he leaves his crease before the bowler bowls, and a batsman can be out ''obstructing the field'' or ''retired out'' at any time.  ''Timed out'' by its nature is a dismissal without a delivery.  With all other modes of dismissal, only one batsman can be dismissed per ball bowled.  ''Obstructing the field, Handled the ball, Timed Out'' and ''Hit the ball twice'' dismissals are extremely rare.

===Fielding and wicket-keeping===
[[Image:Wicket-Keeping_Gloves.jpg|thumb|200px|A pair of Wicket Keeping Gloves. The webbing which helps the Wicket Keeper to catch the ball can be seen between the thumb and index fingers.]] 
:''Main articles: [[Fielder]], [[Fielding strategy (cricket)|Fielding strategy]]''
'''Fielders''' assist the bowlers to prevent batsmen from scoring too many runs. They do this in two ways: by taking catches to dismiss a batsman, and by intercepting hit balls and returning them to the pitch to attempt run-outs to restrict the scoring of runs. 
{{see details|Wicket-keeper}}
The '''wicket-keeper''' is a specialist fielder who stands behind the batsman's wicket throughout the game. His primary job is to gather deliveries that the batsman fails to hit, to prevent them running into the outfield, which would enable batsmen to score [[Extra (cricket)#byes|byes]]. To this end, he wears special gloves (he is the only fielder allowed to do so) and pads to cover his lower legs. Due to his position directly behind the striker, the wicket-keeper has a good chance of getting a batsman out caught off a fine edge from the bat; thicker edges are typically handled by the "slips" fieldsmen. The wicket-keeper is also the only person who can get a batsman out ''stumped''.

===Other roles===
; '''Captain'''
{{see details|Role of a cricket captain}}

The '''captain's''' acumen in deciding the strategy is crucial to the team's success. The captain makes a number of important decisions, including setting field positions, alternating the bowlers and taking the toss. The captain's job on the team is very important but can be rather stressful at times. Much blame is placed on a captain when his team loses. However, it is considered an honour to be in such a privileged position and much praise is given to the captain when his team wins. The burden of the captain's duties can interfere with his quality of play considerably, slightly, or not at all, depending on how well he deals with the stress of his position. 

; '''A runner'''
{{see details|runner (cricket)|Runner}}

In the event of a batsman being fit to bat but too injured to run, he may ask the umpire and the fielding captain for a '''runner'''. The runner chosen must, if possible, be a player who has already been given out. After a batsman hits the ball, the runner's only task is to run between the wickets in place of the injured batsman. 

; '''Substitutes''' 
{{see details|Substitute (cricket)|Substitute}}

In all forms of cricket, if a player gets injured or becomes ill during a match, a substitute is allowed to field instead of him; though he cannot bowl, bat, or act as a captain or wicket-keeper. Here the substitute is a temporary role and leaves the field once the injured player is fit to return.

For 9 months from July 2005, the ICC trialled the concept of a [[Super Sub]] in [[one-day international]] (ODI) cricket and some other limited overs competitions. A single full substitution was allowed, with the replaced player not allowed to return to the game. It was discontinued from March 2006.

==History==
{{main|History of cricket}}

A basic form of the sport can be traced back to the 13th century, but it may have existed even earlier than that. The game seems to have originated among shepherds and farm workers in the [[Weald]] between [[Kent]] and [[Sussex]].  Written evidence exists of a sport known as ''creag'' being played by [[Edward II of England|Prince Edward]], the son of [[Edward I of England|Edward I (Longshanks)]], at Newenden, [[Kent]] in 1300. 

In 1598, a court case referred to a sport called ''Creckett'' being played at the [[Royal Grammar School, Guildford]] around 1550. The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] gives this as the first recorded instance of [[cricket]] in the [[English language]]. 

A number of words are thought to be possible sources for the term '''''cricket'''''. The name may derive from a term for the [[cricket bat]]: old [[French language|French]] ''criquet'' (meaning a kind of [[club]]) or [[Flemish (linguistics)|Flemish]] ''krick(e)'' (meaning a [[stick]]) or in [[Old English language|Old English]] ''crycc'' (meaning a crutch or [[staff (stick)|staff]]). (The latter is problematic, since Old English 'cc' was [[palatal consonant|palatal]] in pronunciation in the south and the west midlands, roughly ''ch'', which is how ''crycc'' leads to ''crych'' and thence ''crutch''; the 'k' sound would be possible in the north, however.) Alternatively, the French ''criquet'' apparently derives from the Flemish word ''krickstoel'', which is a long low [[stool]] on which one kneels in [[church]] and which resembles the long low [[wicket]] with two [[stump (cricket)|stumps]] used in early cricket. 

During the 17th century, numerous references indicate the growth of cricket in the south-east of England.  By the end of the century, it had become an organised activity being played for high stakes and it is possible that the first professionals appeared about that time.  We know that ''a great cricket match'' with eleven players a side was played for high stakes in [[Sussex]] in 1697 and this is the earliest reference we have to [[cricket]] in terms of such importance.

The game underwent major development in the 18th Century and had become the national sport of [[England]] by the end of the century.  Betting played a major part in that development and rich patrons began forming their own "select XIs".  Cricket was prominent in London as early as 1707 and large crowds flocked to matches on the [[Artillery Ground]] in Finsbury.  The [[Hambledon Club]] was founded sometime before 1750 and started playing [[first-class cricket|first-class matches]] in 1756.  For the next 30 years until the formation of [[Marylebone_Cricket_Club|MCC]] and the opening of [[Lord's]] in 1787, Hambledon was the game's greatest club and its focal point.  MCC quickly became the sport's premier club and the custodian of the [[Laws of Cricket]].

The 19th Century saw [[underarm bowling|underarm]] replaced by first [[roundarm bowling|roundarm]] and then [[overarm bowling|overarm]] bowling.  Both developments were accompanied by major controversy.  County clubs appeared from 1836 and ultimately formed a [[County Championship]].  In 1859, a team of [[England]] players went on the first overseas tour (to North America) and 18 years later another England team took part in the first-ever [[Test cricket|Test Match]] at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] against [[Australia]].

Cricket appeared at one [[Olympic Games]], at [[1900 Summer Olympics|Paris in 1900]]. [[Cricket at the 1900 Summer Olympics|Olympic cricket]] lasted only two days and [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]] is the current Olympic champion.

Cricket entered an epochal era in 1963, when English counties modified the rules to provide a variant match form that produced an expedited result: games with a restricted number of overs per side. This gained widespread popularity and resulted in the birth of [[one-day international]] (ODI) matches in 1971. The governing [[International Cricket Council]] quickly adopted the new form and held the first ODI [[Cricket World Cup]] in 1975. Since then, ODI matches have gained mass spectatorship, at the expense of the longer form of the game and to the consternation of fans who prefer the longer form of the game. As of the early 2000s, however, the longer form of cricket is experiencing a growing resurgence in popularity.

There are many different types and grades of cricket; those played professionally at an international level are [[Test cricket]], [[one-day cricket]] and [[Twenty20]].

===Test cricket===
{{main|Test cricket}}

Test cricket is a form of international cricket started in 1877 during the 1876/77 [[English cricket team]]'s tour of Australia. The first Test match began on [[15 March]], [[1877]] and had a timeless format with four balls per over. It ended on [[19 March]], [[1877]] with [[Australian cricket team|Australia]] winning by 45 runs.

The Test Cricket Series between England and Australia is called [[The Ashes]], with the trophy being a tiny fragile urn, reputed to hold the ashes of a bail or cricket ball used during the second Test series between the two countries.  The tiny urn was presented to the English Cricket Captain, [[Ivo Bligh]], by a group of [[Melbourne]] women, following the Test Series win by the England Cricket Team, during the England Cricket Team's Tour of Australia in 1882/83.

Since then, over 1,700 Test matches have been played and the number of Test playing nations has increased to ten with [[Bangladeshi cricket team|Bangladesh]], the most recent nation elevated to [[Test status]], making its debut in 2000. Test matches are two innings per side, usually played over five consecutive days.  Tests that are not finished within the allotted time are drawn.

===One-day cricket===
{{main|One-day international}}
[[Image:Odi dn gabba.jpg|thumb|right|Muttiah Muralitharan bowls to Adam Gilchrist. One Day International Final between Australia and Sri Lanka at the Gabba (Brisbane Cricket Ground) on Tuesday 14th February, 2006.]]
'''Limited overs''' matches, also known as '''one day cricket''' or '''instant cricket''', were introduced in the English domestic season of 1963 due to the growing demands for a shorter and more dramatic form of cricket to stem the decline in attendances. One-day, single-innings, matches often took place before this, but the innovation was the limiting of each side's innings to an agreed number of overs (nowadays usually 50). The idea was taken up in the international arena in 1971, during England's tour of Australia, when a match was played on the scheduled fifth day of the rained-off third Test.  The one-day game has since become a crowd-pleaser and TV-audience-generator across the globe, hastened in part by the success of the inaugural World Cup in 1975. The abbreviations '''ODI''' (One Day International) or sometimes '''LOI''' (Limited Overs International) are used for international matches of this type.  Important one-day matches, international and domestic, often have two days set aside, the second day being a "reserve" day to allow more chance of the game being completed if a result is not possible on the first day (for instance if play is prevented or interrupted by rain). Innovations have included the introduction of coloured clothing, distinct tournaments, and "day-night" matches (where play extends into the night under floodlights); together with frequent nail-biting finishes and the impossibility of either side opting to play for a draw, these have seen ODI cricket gain many supporters.

===Twenty20 Cricket===
{{main|Twenty20}}

'''Twenty20 Cricket'''  was first played in English domestic cricket in 2003 to popularise first-class cricket and attract more spectators to the game. Now it has spread to many other countries. A "Twenty20 Game" consists 20 overs per each side, a free-hit after a no-ball is bowled, short boundaries, batting-friendly pitches, and other rules designed to attract crowds. The first men's Twenty20 international was between [[Australian cricket team|Australia]] and [[New Zealand cricket team|New Zealand]] in 2005, the first women's Twenty20 international having been between [[England women's cricket team|England]] and [[New Zealand women's cricket team|New Zealand]] in 2004.

===First-class matches===
{{main|First-class cricket}}

A '''first-class''' match is generally defined as a high-level international or domestic match that takes place over at least three days on natural (as opposed to artificial) turf.  First-class games are two innings per side.  Like Test matches, if the game is not completed over the allotted time then it is drawn.  Games where the teams have only one innings each are not first-class (including one-day internationals).

A two-innings match of at least three days duration is granted first-class status only if both teams have first-class status. For example, Test matches, other games between two Test nations, games between two domestic teams deemed first-class in countries holding full membership of the ICC, and games between a Test nation's national side (or a team drawn from a national touring squad) and a first-class domestic team from a Test nation, are usually deemed to be first class.  Matches between [[Kenya]], one of the leading associate members of the ICC, and another team adjudjed first-class are usually granted first-class status, but domestic matches in Kenya are not.

Among cricket statisticians, first class cricket is variously deemed to have started in 1660, 1772, 1801, 1815 or 1864.  This ongoing controversy is described in the main article.

===Other forms of cricket===
{{main|Forms of cricket}}

At all levels, the rules of cricket are often modified.  At international or first-class levels this is usually in order to make the game more commercially attractive.  More or less formal domestic [[club cricket]] matches are usually played over one to two days, either two innings per side or one innings per side with limited overs.  At lower levels the rules are often changed simply to make the game playable with limited resources, or to render it more convenient and enjoyable for the participants.  Variants of the sport are played in areas as diverse as sandy beaches and ice floes.  Families and teenagers play [[backyard cricket]] in suburban yards or driveways, and the teemimg cities of India and Pakistan play host to countless games of 'Gully Cricket' or 'Tapeball'on their streets.   Tennis balls and homemade bats are often used, and a variety of objects may serve as wickets. Sometimes the rules are also improvised: for instance it is sometimes agreed that fielders can catch the ball with one hand after one bounce and claim a wicket, or if only a few people are available then everyone may field while the players take it in turns to bat. 

In [[Kwik cricket]], the bowler does not have to wait for the batsman to be ready before a delivery, leading to a faster, more exhausting game designed to appeal to children, which is often used in English schools' PE lessons.  [[Indoor cricket]] is played in a netted, indoor arena.

==International structure==
{{main|International structure of cricket}}
[[Image:ICC-cricket-member-nations.png|thumb|270px|ICC member nations. Orange are Test playing nations; green are the associate member nations; and purple are the affiliate member nations.]]
The [[International Cricket Council]] (''ICC'') is the international governing body for cricket. It is headquartered in [[Dubai]] and includes representatives of each of the ten Test-playing nations, as well as an elected panel representing non-Test-playing nations.

Each nation has a national cricket board which regulates cricket matches played in their country. The cricket board also selects the national squad and organises home and away tours for the national team.

Nations playing cricket are separated into three tiers depending on the level of cricket infrastructure in that country. At the highest level are the [[List of International Cricket Council members#Full_Members|Test-playing nations]]. They qualify automatically for the quadrennial World Cup matches. A rung lower are the [[List of International Cricket Council members#Associate_Members|Associate Member nations]]. The lowermost rung consists of the [[List of International Cricket Council members#Affiliate_Members|Affiliate Member nations]].
