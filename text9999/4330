'''William Ford Gibson''' (born [[1948-03-17]]) is an [[United States of America|American]]-[[Canada|Canadian]]<ref name="modern boys">{{cite news |first=William |last=Gibson |title=Modern boys and mobile girls |url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/life/story/0,,466391,00.html |work=The Japan issue |publisher=''[[The Observer]]'' |date=[[2001-04-01]] |accessdate=2007-10-28 }}</ref> writer who has been called the "noir prophet" of the [[cyberpunk]] subgenre of [[science fiction]].<ref name="smh"/> In 1982, Gibson coined the term [[cyberspace]] and popularized the concept in his debut [[novel]], ''[[Neuromancer]]'' (1984). Gibson is best known for depicting a visualised, worldwide communications network before it became established in the 1990s, and he is credited with anticipating and establishing the conceptual foundations of the Internet and the [[World Wide Web]].

Having moved around frequently with his family as a child, Gibson grew to be a shy, ungainly teenager who took refuge in reading science fiction. After spending his adolescence at a private boarding school in Arizona, Gibson dodged the draft at the onset of the [[Vietnam War]] by emigrating to Canada, where he became immersed in [[counterculture]] and after a few years became a full-time author. Gibson's early writings are primarily futuristic stories about the effect of cybernetics and cyberspace on humans&nbsp;&ndash; lowlife meets high tech. In the 1980s, Gibson's short stories developed a noir, bleak feel. They attracted widespread attention after being published in science fiction magazines, and eventually effectively renovated the science fiction genre, which had been widely considered insignificant. The themes, settings and characters developed in these stories culminated in his first novel, ''Neuromancer'', which garnered unprecedented critical and considerable commercial success, virtually launching the [[cyberpunk]] literary movement.

Although much of Gibson's reputation has remained rooted in ''Neuromancer'', his work has continued to evolve in style and concept. After expanding on ''Neuromancer'' with two more novels to complete the dystopic [[Sprawl trilogy]], Gibson became central to an entirely new science fiction sub-genre&nbsp;&ndash; [[steampunk]]&nbsp;&ndash; with the publication in 1990 of the alternate history novel ''The Difference Engine'', written in collaboration with [[Bruce Sterling]]. In the 1990s he composed the [[Bridge trilogy]] of novels, which focused on sociological observations of near future urban environments and late-stage capitalism. His most recent novels&nbsp;&ndash; ''Pattern Recognition'' (2003) and ''Spook Country'' (2007)&nbsp;&ndash; are each set in a contemporary universe and have put Gibson's work onto mainstream bestseller lists for the first time.

''The Literary Encyclopedia'' identifies Gibson as "one of North America's most highly acclaimed science fiction writers". To date, Gibson has written a number of short stories, nine critically acclaimed novels (one in collaboration), a nonfiction [[artist's book]], and has contributed articles to several major publications and collaborated extensively with performance artists, filmmakers and musicians. Feted by ''The Guardian'' in 1999 as "probably the most important novelist of the past two decades", his work has been cited as an influence on science fiction authors, academia, [[cyberculture]], and technology. Although he retains dual citizenship,<ref name="seattle pi"/> William Gibson has lived in Vancouver, Canada since leaving the US in the 1960s.<ref name="looking glass"/>

After his mother's death, Gibson left school without graduating and became very isolated for a long time, traveling to California and Europe and immersing himself in [[counterculture]].<ref name="nomaps"/><ref name="observer"/><ref name="seattle pi"/> In 1967, he elected to move to [[Canada]] in order "to [[Draft dodger#Draft dodging and the Vietnam War|avoid the Vietnam war draft]]".<ref name=sourcecode/><!-- Note: This is not what the cited source says.

Through Shirley, Gibson came into contact with [[Bruce Sterling]] and [[Lewis Shiner]], who would later become pioneers of the cyberpunk movement; reading Gibson's work, they realised that it was, as Sterling put it, "breakthrough material" and that they needed to "put down our preconceptions and pick up on this guy from Vancouver; this [was] the way forward."<ref name="shiner"/><ref name="nomaps"/> Gibson met Sterling at a science fiction convention in [[Denver, Colorado]] in the autumn of 1981, where he read "[[Hackers (short stories)#"Burning Chrome"|Burning Chrome]]"&nbsp;&ndash; the first cyberspace short story&nbsp;&ndash; to an audience of four people, and later stated that Sterling "completely got it".<ref name="nomaps"/>

== Literary career ==
=== Early short fiction ===
{{details|Burning Chrome}}
[[Image:FSmileFridge.jpg|thumb|right|A [[refrigerator]] abandoned in the [[French Quarter]] of [[New Orleans]] the aftermath of [[Hurricane Katrina]] appropriated as a [[graffiti]] artwork, illustrating Gibson's assertion in "[[Hackers (short stories)#"Burning Chrome"|Burning Chrome]]" (1981) that "the street finds its own uses for things."]]
Gibson's early writings are generally [[futuristic]] stories about the influences of [[cybernetics]] and cyberspace (computer-simulated reality) technology on the human race. His themes of hi-tech [[shantytowns]], recorded or broadcast stimulus (later to be developed into the "sim-stim" package featured so heavily in ''[[Neuromancer]]''), and dystopic intermingling of technology and humanity, are already evident in his first published short story, "[[Fragments of a Hologram Rose]]" (1977).<ref name="project cyberpunk interview"/> The latter thematic obsession was described by his friend and fellow author, [[Bruce Sterling]], in the introduction of Gibson's short story collection ''[[Burning Chrome]]'', as "Gibson's classic one-two combination of lowlife and high tech."<ref>{{cite book |last=Gibson |first=William |coauthors=[[Bruce Sterling]] |title=[[Burning Chrome]] |year=1986 |publisher=Harper Collins |location=New York |isbn=0060539828 |oclc = 51342671}}</ref>

In the 1980s, Gibson's short stories appeared in ''[[Omni (magazine)|Omni]]'' and ''Universe 11'', wherein his fiction developed a [[film noir]], bleak feel. In his early work, Gibson consciously distanced himself as far as possible from the mainstream of science fiction (towards which he felt "an aesthetic revulsion"), to the extent that his highest goal was to become "a minor cult figure, a sort of lesser [[J.G. Ballard|Ballard]]."<ref name="project cyberpunk interview"/> When [[Bruce Sterling]] started to distribute the stories, he found that "people were just genuinely baffled... I mean they could not literally parse the guy's paragraphs... the imaginative tropes he was inventing were just beyond peoples' grasp."<ref name="nomaps"/>

While Larry McCaffery has commented that these early short stories displayed flashes of Gibson's ability, fellow science fiction critic [[Darko Suvin]] has identified them as "undoubtedly [cyberpunk's] best works", constituting the "furthest horizon" of the genre.<ref name="storming"/> The themes which Gibson developed in the stories, the [[the Sprawl|setting]] of "[[Hackers (short stories)#"Burning Chrome"|Burning Chrome]]" and the character of [[Molly Millions]] from "[[Johnny Mnemonic]]" ultimately culminated in his first novel, ''[[Neuromancer]]''.<ref name="storming"/>

The Sprawl trilogy was followed by the 1990 novel ''[[The Difference Engine]]'', an [[alternate history (fiction)|alternate history]] novel Gibson wrote in collaboration with [[Bruce Sterling]]. Set in a technologically advanced [[Victorian era]] Britain, the novel was a departure from the authors' cyberpunk roots. It was nominated for the [[Nebula Award for Best Novel]] in 1991 and the [[John W. Campbell Memorial Award]] in 1992, and is often cited as a central novel of the [[steampunk]] genre.<ref name="steampunkt">{{cite news | first = Peter | last = Bebergal | title = The age of steampunk | url = http://www.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2007/08/26/the_age_of_steampunk/ | publisher = [[The Boston Globe]] | page = 3

== Collaborations, adaptations and miscellanea==

=== Literary collaborations ===
[[Image:Bruce_Sterling_at_Robofest.jpg|thumb|left|[[Bruce Sterling]] (left) at [[Robofest]] '94. Sterling co-authored with Gibson the short story "[[Red Star, Winter Orbit]]" (1983) and the 1990 [[steampunk]] novel ''[[The Difference Engine]]''.]]
Three of the stories that later appeared in ''[[Burning Chrome]]'' were written in collaboration with other authors: "[[The Belonging Kind]]" (1981) with [[John Shirley]], "[[Red Star, Winter Orbit]]" (1983) with [[Bruce Sterling]],<ref name="looking glass">{{cite news |first=Joel |last=Garreau |title=Through the Looking Glass |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/05/AR2007090502582_pf.html |publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]'' |date=[[2007-09-06]] |accessdate=2007-10-30 }}</ref> and "[[Hackers (anthology)#"Dogfight"|Dogfight]]" (1985) with [[Michael Swanwick]].

Gibson and Sterling collaborated again on the short story "The Angel of Goliad" in 1990,<ref name="locusmag"/> which they soon expanded into the novel-length [[Alternate history (fiction)|alternate history]] story ''[[The Difference Engine]]'' (1990).

Gibson's early efforts to write film scripts failed to manifest themselves as finished product.  For example, "Burning Chrome" (which was to be directed by [[Kathryn Bigelow]]) and "Neuro-Hotel" were two attempts by the author at film adaptations that were never made.<ref name="salza">{{cite interview |last=Gibson |first=William |interviewer=Giuseppe Salza |city=Cannes |year=1994 |month=May |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/235 |accessdate=2007-10-28}}</ref> In the late 1980s he wrote an early version of ''[[Alien<U+00B3>]]'' (which he later characterized as "[[Andrei Tarkovsky|Tarkovskian]]"), few elements of which survived in the final version.<ref name="salza"/>
Gibson's early involvement with the film industry extended far beyond the confines of the [[Hollywood]] blockbuster system. At one point, he collaborated on a script with [[Kazakhstan|Kazakh]] director [[Rashid Nugmanov]] after an American [[film producer|producer]] had expressed an interest in a Soviet-American collaboration to star Russian-Korean star [[Victor Tsoi]].<ref name="victor tsoi">{{cite web |url= http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/blog/2003_03_01_archive.asp#90416069
|title=Victor Tsoi |accessdate=2007-12-03 |last=Gibson |first=William |date=[[2003-03-06]]}}</ref> Despite being occupied with writing a novel, Gibson was reluctant to abandon the "wonderfully odd project" which involved "ritualistic [[gang warfare|gang-warfare]] in some sort of sideways-future [[Leningrad]]" and sent [[Jack Womack]] to Russia in his stead. Rather than producing a motion picture, a prospect that ended with Tsoi's death in an automotive accident, Womack's experiences in Russia ultimately culminated in his novel ''[[Let's Put the Future Behind Us]]'' and informed much of the Russian content of Gibson's ''[[Pattern Recognition (novel)|Pattern Recognition]]''.<ref name="victor tsoi"/> A similarly doomed fate befell Gibson's mooted collaboration with Japanese filmmaker [[Sogo Ishii]] in 1991,<ref name="storming"/> a film they plotted on shooting in the [[Walled City of Kowloon]] prior to its demolition by the Chinese government.<ref name="sogo">{{cite web|url= http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/blog/2006_07_01_archive.asp#115354123358489417 |title=Burst City Trailer |first=William |last=Gibson |date=[[2006-07-21]] |accessdate=2007-11-26}}</ref>

Adaptations of Gibson's fiction have frequently been optioned and proposed, to limited success. Two of the author's short stories, both set in the [[Sprawl trilogy]] universe, have been loosely [[Film adaptation|adapted]] as [[film]]s: ''[[Johnny Mnemonic (film)|Johnny Mnemonic]]'' (1995) with screenplay by Gibson and starring [[Keanu Reeves]], [[Dolph Lundgren]] and [[Takeshi Kitano]], and ''[[New Rose Hotel (film)|New Rose Hotel]]'' (1998), starring [[Christopher Walken]], [[Willem Dafoe]], and [[Asia Argento]].
