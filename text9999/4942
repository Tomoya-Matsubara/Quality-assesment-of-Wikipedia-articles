The '''Shivwits Band of Paiutes''' are a band of the [[Paiute Indian Tribe of Utah]], a [[federally recognized tribe]] of [[Southern Paiute]]s located in southwestern [[Utah]].

==History==
The Shivwits Paiutes settled in Utah around 1100 CE. They hunted rabbits, deer, and mountain sheep and gathered seeds, roots, tubers, berries, and nuts, particularly [[pine nuts]]. They were farmers living along the [[Santa Clara River (Utah)|Santa Clara River]] and the [[Virgin River]] and cultivated crops of corn, squash, melons, gourds, sunflowers, and, after European contact, winter wheat.<ref name=utah>[http://www.utahpaiutes.org/bands/shivwits/ "Shivwits Band of Paiutes."] ''Paiute Indian Tribe of Utah.'' 2009 (retrieved 7 Dec 2009)</ref>

The [[Dominguez-Escalante Expedition]] of 1776 was most likely the Shivwits' first contact with Europeans. [[Fur trader]] [[Jedediah Smith]] created a route to California directly through Paiute territory. The 19th century brought non-Native trappers, traders, and settlers to the area. The newly introduced livestock had a negative effect on the area's delicate ecology. [[Ute Tribe|Ute]]s and [[Navajo people|Navajos]] often captured Paiute women and children and sold them to European-Americans as slaves. [[Mormon]]s permanently settled on Paiute lands in the 1850s, putting an end to the Shivwits' traditional lifestyle.<ref name=utah/>

Their reservation was formed in 1891 with only {{convert|100|acre|km2}}. It did not receive water rights so they were forced to abandon farming.<ref name=water>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4188/is_20031120/ai_n11431975/ "U.S. accord gives water to Shivwits."] ''Desert News'' via BNET. 20 Nov 2003 (retrieved 7 Dec 2009)</ref>  The reservation had a population of 194 in that year.  There were 154 Shivwits in 1906.<ref>[http://www.accessgenealogy.com/native/tribes/paiute/paiutehistory.htm "Paiute Indian Tribe History."] ''Access Genealogy.'' (retrieved 7 Dec 2009)</ref> The Shivwits Band of Paiute Indians of Utah first received federal recognized on March 3, 1891 as the "Shebit tribe of Indians in [[Washington County, Utah]]."<ref name=utah/>

Along with other Utah [[Paiute]] tribes, the Shivwits' relationship with the federal government was [[Indian termination policy|terminated]] in the 1950s.<ref name=p231>Pritzker, 231</ref> Unlike other Paiute groups the Shivwits retained ownership of their lands after termination and leased them to ranchers instead of selling them outright.

==Name==
Shivwits or Shivwitz comes from the [[Colorado River language|Southern Paiute]] word, ''sipicimi''. The word may be based on the prefix ''sibi''-, meaning "east" or ''si-vints''', meaning "people who live in the east." It is also spelled Shi'-vwits, She-bits, S<U+00FC>b<U+00FC>'ts, and Sebit. The Shivwits Plateau in [[Arizona]] is named for the tribe.<ref>d'Azevedo, 396</ref>

==Recent developments==
The Shivwits regained federal recognition through an act signed by President [[Jimmy Carter]] on 3 April 1980.<ref name=utah/><ref name=p231/> The reservation is larger than it was originally, covering over {{convert|240|acre|km2}}.

In 2003 the Shivwits received water rights for {{convert|4000|acre.ft|lk=in}} annually, enabling the tribe to create new economic development projects.<ref name=water/>

==Today==
The tribe is headquartered in [[Ivins, Utah|Ivins]], located in [[Washington County, Utah]]. Their Band Chairperson is Charlotte Lomeli.<ref name=utah/>
