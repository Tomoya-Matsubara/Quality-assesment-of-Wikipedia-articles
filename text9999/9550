'''Radyr''' is an outer [[suburb]] of [[Cardiff]], the capital of [[Wales]]. The suburb is situated in the [[Cardiff West|west]] of the city, although it was originally a separate village, and is located around 5 miles (8 kilometres) north west of [[Cardiff city centre]]. The population was recorded at 4,658 according to the 2001 Census. Radyr is administratively linked to the adjacent community of Morganstown, but they are now physically divided by the [[M4 motorway]].

==History==
===Stone Age until the Norman Conquest===
Evidence of [[stone age]] occupation of the Lesser Garth Cave (located near Morganstown) was discovered in 1912 and included worked flints.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jstor.org/pss/298662|title=Roman Britain in 1963: I.

===Origin of the name===
Hints about the derivation of the name ''Radyr'' can be found in Lifris's writings "Life of St Cadog" written between 1081 and 1104 but relating to the earlier period around 530 AD, which mentions a croft or "tref" on the site called ''Aradur Hen''. Lifris also tells the story of ''Tylyway'', a religious hermit who was held to have lived on the banks of the Taff. Tylyway's cell is the most likely origin of the name Radyr; from the Welsh ''yr adur'', meaning "the chantry", although ''Arudur Hen'' is also possible.<ref name="TC&G" />

===Norman occupation until the Middle Ages===

[[Image:Sir William Mathew Llandaf Cathedral.JPG|thumb|right|Sir William and Lady Mathew, Llandaff Cathedral]]
The 14th century Welsh Lord of Radyr Cynwrig ap Hywel, followed by his descendants, farmed the area until it was devastated by the [[Black Death]] plague and battles between the [[Marcher Lords]] in 1300s and 1400s when the whole area was laid to waste.<ref name="TC&G" />   

In 1469 Thomas Mathew inherited the land through marriage and built Radyr Court, an imposing [[manor house]] on the site of what is now the Radyr Court Inn in Danescourt.<ref name="TC&G" />  The house was used as a court and although it was destroyed by a fire in the 1800s, the three large [[dungeons]] survived and can still be seen at the Inn.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-116182175.html|title=Court in the Act|last=Welsh|first=Sarah|date=2004-05-01|publisher=[[South Wales Echo]]|accessdate=2009-04-20}}</ref> On Thomas's death his lands passed to his eldest son David and then to his younger son William Mathew, who was [[knighted]] by [[King Henry VII]] at the [[battle of Bosworth]] in 1485.<ref name="TC&G" /> William's successor was his eldest son Sir George Mathew who became the [[Member_of_Parliament#United_Kingdom|Member of Parliament]] for [[Glamorgan]] and Sheriff of the County.<ref name="TC&G" /><ref>{{cite book|title=Glamorgan Sheriffs|editor=Patricia Moore|publisher=Gwasg Prifysgol Cymru / University of Wales Press|location=Cardiff|date=January 1995|isbn=9780708312643}}</ref>

===Tudor legacy===
Successful [[Tudor dynasty|Tudor]] nobles were expected to have extensive [[Medieval deer park|deer parks]], but Sir George created a deer park that partially caused the decline of the family fortune, as it ranged so far to the north of Radyr it caused the previous income from tenant farmers to cease when they were evicted from their farms.<ref name="TC&G" />  He also had twenty-four children, (eight of whom were illegitimate). Many of these children were daughters, and so a large sum of money was required to prove [[dowry|dowries]] for them.<ref name="TC&G" /> On his death Sir George's lands passed to his eldest son William, who also became a Member of Parliament and invested in the [[Pentyrch]] ironworks.<ref name="TC&G" />  This proved to be an astute move as the [[feudal system]] was being replaced by the beginnings of [[industrialisation]]. William's descendants however inherited a diminishing fortune and Captain George Mathew, the last of the family to live in Radyr, married Elizabeth Poyntz and the couple departed from Radyr to live on her estates at [[Thurles]] in [[County Tipperary]], [[Ireland]] during 1625.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://martinrealm.org/genealogy/mathew.htm|title=Mathew of Thurles|accessdate=2008-06-28}}</ref>

===Stuart period===
The new owner of Radyr was wealthy landowner Sir Edward Lewis,<ref name="cardiff-records">{{cite book|title=Cardiff Records: volume 2|editor=John Hobson Matthews|publisher=Institute of Historical Research|date=1900|pages=8-41|chapter=The manors of Cardiff district: Descriptions|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=48109#s24}}</ref> who was knighted by [[James I of England|King James I]].

The Lewis fortune finally went to Elizabeth Lewis, who married the [[Earl of Plymouth|3rd Earl of Plymouth]], the principal landowner in Cardiff, Penarth and [[Barry, South Glamorgan|Barry]].<ref name="TC&G" />

A survey in 1766 shows that the Plymouth family owned the freeholds in most of Radyr and continues to do so today. Twenty two acres of residential land within Radyr were sold by Plymouth Estates in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.coark.com/images/uploads/Annual_Review_2007.pdf|title=Property Profile 2007|year=2007|accessdate=2008-06-28|format=PDF}}</ref>

===Development from the 18th century===
Built in 1749, the Melingriffith [[Tinplate]] Works just across the [[River Taff]] from Radyr was built on or near the site of an old corn mill that had operated as far back as the late 1100s. Melingriffith was the largest working tin factory in the UK, until the much later construction of the Treforest Tin Works. People in Radyr would set their watches by the sound of the works hooters, which were also sounded to see in the new year.<ref name="Memories" /> The tinplate works became the major employer for workers from Radyr and would remain so for nearly two hundred years.
[[Image:Melingriffith feeder stream.jpg|thumb|left|Melingriffith Feeder]]
The tin mills were powered exclusively by water drawn from the River Taff down the Melingriffith feeder stream, a water course that doubled as a [[canal]] that carried raw [[iron ore]] from the Pentyrch Iron Works until around 1815, when the Pentyrch tramroad was completed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whitchurchandllandaff.co.uk/Melingriffith.htm|title=The Pentyrch Iron Works and Melingriffith Light Railway|accessdate=2009-05-05}}</ref> The tramroad crossed the River Taff over the Iron Bridge. The feeder<U+2019>s lock was permanently closed in 1871 when it was bridged over, but traces of it still remain.
 
The tin works closed in 1957,<ref name="tinworks">{{cite news|url=http://www.whitchurchandllandaff.co.uk/Melingriffith.htm|title=It's goodbye to Griffith's Mill|last=Pride|first=W.E.|date=1957-07-30|publisher=[[Western Mail (Wales)|Western Mail]]|accessdate=2009-05-05}}</ref> and today the only signs that the works ever existed at all are the mostly dry bed of the original Melingriffith feeder stream that still runs down from the River Taff from just above the Radyr weir, and the recently restored water pump standing opposite Oak Cottage. The works site itself has been completely cleared, and is now a modern housing estate.
[[Image:Melingriffith Water Pump.jpg|thumb|right|Melingriffith water pump]]
The Melingriffith feeder stream made its way to the original [[Glamorganshire Canal]], where they ran in parallel through the Tin Works and out the other side at Melingriffith Lock. Where they had come together north of the Tin Works, any overflow from the Canal was originally designed to empty into the feeder. This point is now at the southern end of the Glamorganshire Canal Local Nature Reserve and all the water from the canal runs into the feeder before disappearing into a piped water course that passes under the modern housing estate.<ref name="canal">{{cite book|last=Cumberlidge|first=Jane|title=Inland Waterways of Great Britain|publisher=Imray Laurie Norie and Wilson|isbn=0-85288-355-2}}</ref>

At the southern end of the housing estate, the feeder re-emerges at the point where the Melingriffith water pump stands, the pump originally designed to lift water from the bottom of the feeder back into the Canal at Melingriffith Lock.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/80448|title=Melingriffith water pump (melingruffydd)|publisher=[[Geograph British Isles]]|accessdate=2009-05-05}}</ref> Today, the Glamorganshire Canal has been almost totally overbuilt. Ty Mawr Road has replaced the route of the canal from Melingriffith all the way to Whitchurch.<ref name="canal" />

Samual Lewis says in his 1849 "Topographical Dictionary of Wales" says of Radyr:<ref>{{cite book|last=Lewis|first=Samuel|title=A Topographical Dictionary of Wales|publisher=Institute of Historical Research|date=1849|pages=345-356|chapter=Radyr - Rhuddlan|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=47882}}</ref>

<blockquote>"A parish, in the poorlaw union of Cardiff, hundred of Kibbor, county of Glamorgan, in South Wales, 3<U+00BD> miles (N. W. by W.) from Cardiff; containing 279 inhabitants. This parish probably derives its name, signifying "a cataract," from the rushing waters of the river T<U+00E2>f, by which it is bounded on the north-east. It was formerly comprehended within the hundred of Miskin, but has been recently separated therefrom. It comprises about eleven hundred acres of arable and pasture land, inclosed and in a profitable state of cultivation: the surface is in some parts elevated, and in others flat, but no where subject to inundation; the soil is a strong brown earth, favourable to the production of good crops of grain of all kinds, potatoes, and hay. The substratum is partly a hard brown stone, and partly limestone of very good quality. Radyr Court, formerly the seat of the family of Matthew, ancestors of the late Lord Llandaf, has been partially taken down, and the remainder has been modernised, and converted into a farmhouse. The turnpike-road leading from Cardiff to Llantrissent passes a little to the south of the parish; and the T<U+00E2>f-Vale railway runs through it, nearly parallel with the river, which is crossed by the line in this vicinity. Some of the inhabitants are employed at the iron-works in the parish of Pentyrch.</blockquote>

<blockquote>''The living is a vicarage, endowed with <U+00A3>200 royal bounty; patron and impropriator, the representative of the late Earl of Plymouth, who is lord of the manor: the tithes have been commuted for <U+00A3>113. 9s. 0d, of which a sum of <U+00A3>38. 9s. 0d is payable to the impropriator, and a sum of <U+00A3>75 to the vicar. The church, dedicated to St. John the Baptist, is a neat plain edifice, with a curious turret at the west end. There is a place of worship for Calvinistic Methodists; a Sunday school for gratuitous instruction is held in it, and another at Radyr Court. In the parish is a spring of very cold water, called Y Pistyll Goleu, "the bright water-spout," issuing from the side of a hill, under a considerable depth of earth over a limestone rock: it has by some writers been termed mineral, but it is not known to possess any other properties than that of its extreme coldness, which renders it efficacious in curing sprains and weakness of the sinews."'' </blockquote> 

Until the mid 1800's Radyr was a collection of small farms, crofts and cottages, but after [[Radyr railway station]] opened in 1863,<ref>{{cite book|author=Hutton, John|title=The Taff Vale Railway, vol. 1|publisher=Silver Link|year=2006|ISBN 978-1-85794-249-1}}</ref> the population increased from 400 to over 600 residents over a twenty year period.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/wal/GLA/Radyr/population.html|title=Population Statistics for Radyr|accessdate=2008-06-28}}</ref> The [[Taff Vale Railway]] and its successor the [[Great Western Railway]] brought significant employment to Radyr and when Junction Terrace (the first 'street' in Radyr) was built to house the railway workers it was the start of a steep demand for housing in Radyr that transformed the peaceful hamlet and continues to do so today.<ref name="TC&G" />

===Wartime Radyr===
[[Image:Radyr War memorial.JPG|120px|thumb|right|Radyr War memorial]]
In the [[First World War]] the community raised funds for a 'Radyr bed' at the nearby Welsh Metropolitan Military Hospital in [[Whitchurch, Cardiff|Whitchurch]] and set up a 'Citizen Guard' from those to old or too young to enlist.<ref name="TC&G" />  Losses suffered by the village are recorded on the War Memorial in Heol Isaf.

During the [[Second World War]] thousands of children were evacuated from metropolitan areas like [[London]], [[Birmingham]] and [[Liverpool]]. One evacuee, Patricia Armstrong aged nine, was knocked down by a passenger train and killed on a Saturday afternoon in May 1943 while negotiating the Gelynis foot crossing at Morganstown. She was an evacuee from the [[Woolwich]] area and was lodging with a family in Morganstown.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.patricia-armstrong.freewebweb.com/|title=Patricia Armstrong|accessdate=2008-07-12}}</ref> As [[Cardiff Blitz|air raids on Cardiff]] increased, even younger children from Radyr were evacuated to residential boarding schools at Rhoose and Bridgend.<ref>{{cite book|last=Strange|first=Keith|title=Cardiff schools and the age of the Second World War|pages=15|url=http://www.scribd.com/doc/2589099/Cardiff-schools-and-the-age-of-the-Second-World-War|accessdate=2009-05-05}}</ref>

Radyr is administered by Radyr & Morganstown Community Council, which is funded by an addition to the [[Council Tax]] bill paid by local residents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cardiff.gov.uk/objview.asp?Object_ID=13860&|title=Council Tax 2009/2010|publisher=[[Cardiff County Council]]|accessdate=2009-05-05}}</ref> The Community Council is run by eleven elected councillors from three separate wards within the parish - Radyr North (4 seats), Radyr South (3 seats) and Morganstown (4 seats).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cardiff.gov.uk/content.asp?nav=2867%2C3597%2C5004&parent_directory_id=2865&id=4048|title=Radyr Community Council (11 Seats)|publisher=[[Cardiff County Council]]|accessdate=2009-05-05}}</ref> At the Community Council's annual meeting on 15 May 2008, David Silver was elected Chair of the Council for 2008 and 2009 and Rachel Granger was elected Vice Chair.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radyr.org.uk/holding/council/Community%20Minutes%2015%20May%20%202008.pdf|title=Annual Community Council Meeting Minutes May 15 2008|date=2008-05-15|publisher=Radyr & Morganstown Community Council|accessdate=2009-05-05}}</ref>

==Geography==
===Geological structure===
The surrounding [[soil]]s are mostly a strong, brown, dry earth, well adapted for arable farming and the growing of grains of all kinds that contributed to the area being a mostly farming community until the modern era. Soils were further enriched over the millennia by [[Alluvium|alluvial deposits]] from the River Taff. The substratum under the whole area is a deep brown [[sandstone]], [[limestone]] and lime shale that was likely laid down under a warm ocean at some stage in the distant past and subsequently ground down by [[glacier]]s during the last [[Ice Age|ice age]] around 18,000 years ago.<ref name="TC&G" /> Radyr Stone is a [[Triassic]] [[breccia]] used widely for decorative work in the Cardiff area, including [[Llandaff Cathedral]], [[Bute Docks|Cardiff Docks]] and in the bridges of the [[Taff Vale Railway]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.englishstone.org.uk/documents/dimension%20stone%208.html|title=Triassic building sandstone resources |accessdate=2008-07-07}}</ref>

===Radyr Weir===
[[Image:Radyr Weir.JPG|thumb|right|Radyr Weir]]
The [[River Taff]] rises in the [[Brecon Beacons]] as two rivers. At [[Abercynon]] it is joined by the [[River Cynon]] and at [[Pontypridd]] it is joined by the [[River Rhondda]]. From Pontypridd, it runs roughly south, through [[Taff's Well]] and Radyr and into [[Llandaff]].

First built in 1774 to provide water along a feeder to power the Mellingriffith tin-plate works,<ref name="TC&G" /> the [[weir]] on the [[River Taff]] at Radyr is the third obstruction to migratory [[salmon]] and [[sea trout]] (the others being Llandaff Weir and Blackweir, both of which also have fish passes).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/static/documents/Research/taffelysap_e_827476.pdf|title=Rivers Taff and Ely Salmon Action Plan|date=December 2003|publisher=[[National Rivers Authority]]|accessdate=2009-05-07}}</ref> Since the early 1980s the salmon and sea trout stocks in the Taff have been recovering from nearly 200 years of industrial pollution and exploitation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/static/documents/Research/taffelysap_e_827476.pdf|title=Local Biodiversity Action Plan for Rhondda Cynon Taf|date=2000-01-01|publisher=Biodiversity Action Reporting System|accessdate=2009-05-07}}</ref> During 1993 the [[National Rivers Authority]] monitored over 500 salmon and 700 sea trout returning to the river to spawn.<ref name="walks">{{cite web|url=http://www.glamorganwalks.com/local_features_mid.htm|title=Local Features Mid|publisher=Glamorgan Walks|accessdate=2009-05-07}}</ref>

From 1749 iron from [[Pentyrch]] was initially transported to the works using pack-horses, then tub boats were used on the Taff passing onto the feeder via a lock at Radyr Weir. Parts of this lock can still be seen alongside the feeder sluice. In 1815 the tub boats were discontinued and a tramway constructed along the Taff.<ref name="walks" /> There is a public picnic site adjacent to the Radyr weir.

The River Taff through Radyr is flanked on both sides by an undeveloped greenway that cuts uninterrupted through northern Cardiff all the way to [[Cardiff Castle]] in the very centre of the city, before the river discharges into the newly created Cardiff Bay freshwater lake that is enclosed by the [[Cardiff Bay Barrage]].

===Radyr Woods Nature Area===
[[Image:Radyr Woods boardwalk.JPG|thumb|right|Radyr Woods boardwalk]]
Radyr Woods is designated as a [[Site of Nature Conservation Importance]] and the adjoining Hermit Woods is additionally designated a [[Local Nature Reserve]].<ref name="woods">{{cite web|url=http://www.cardiff.gov.uk/objview.asp?object_id=3617|title=Radyr Woods|publisher=Cardiff Council|accessdate=2008-06-29}}</ref> The community nature reserve extends to {{convert|5.67|ha|abbr=on|lk=on}} with a network of footpaths and boardwalks and includes evidence of [[iron age]] settlements and remains of an early cooking hearth. Originally part of the Tudor deer park owned by the Mathew family and later Radyr Quarry, the area is owned by [[Cardiff Council]] and Plymouth Estates, managed by the Radyr community council with the support of Cardiff Council's Parks Service.<ref name="discoverradyrwoods">{{cite web|url=http://www.radyr.org.uk/homepages/woods.php|title=Discovering Radyr Woods|accessdate=2008-06-29}}</ref>

Radyr Woods provides important habitats for a wide range of species. It also has a number of natural springs that feed a duck pond and a [[European Kingfisher|kingfisher]] pond. Recent housing developments between the reserve and the railway line have added complementary public open space with picnic areas and a children's play area.  Since 1986 all maintenance and development of the reserve has been carried out by a volunteer group known as The Friends of Radyr Woods.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radyr.org.uk/pdf_files/chain173.pdf|title=Radyr Chain, NUmber 173|date=2007-12-01|publisher=Radyr & Morganstown Association|accessdate=2009-05-12}}</ref>

===Radyr Hawkweed===
[[Image:Radyr Hawkweed.JPG|thumb|right|Radyr Hawkweed]]
Radyr Hawkweed is the common name of ''[[Hieracium radyrense]]'', a very rare [[endemism|endemic]] species related to the [[Asteraceae|aster, daisy, or sunflower family]], so far only identified with Radyr, originally at the quarry. First identified in 1907 it was described as a variety in 1948 and a separate species in 1955 and belongs to Hieracium Section Vulgata. It has rarely been seen and regular surveys between 1998 and 2004 indicate that today only a single population of around twenty five plants survives in the wild.<ref name="watsonia">{{cite web|url=http://www.watsonia.org.uk/25_4_HutchinsonHieracium.pdf|title=Radyr Hawkweed|accessdate=2008-06-21|format=PDF}}</ref>

In the first survey during 1998, a total of just nine plants were then identified in one single Radyr garden, where it traditionally grew on grassy banks and lawns, often in shade. It was no longer found at the original locality of Radyr Quarry where examples were last seen in 1985. At [[Bridgend]], six possible plants of the Radyr genus were found on an old garden wall, but confirmation of identification is still awaited.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/en/171/|title=Biodiversity & Systematic Biology - Projects|publisher=[[National Museum of Wales]]|accessdate=2009-05-13}}</ref>

Neither the species nor the sites have any current legal protection, and it could be under significant threat of survival in the long term from inappropriate gardening or care.<ref name="watsonia" /> Seed samples of the Radyr Hawkweed have been provided to the [[Millennium Seed Bank]], the international [[conservation biology|conservation]] project coordinated by the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]], and plants are being carefully cultivated.<ref name="watsonia" /> The plant normally flowers between May and early July and Radyr residents are urged by botanists to be on the look out for further examples of the endangered species while walking in the area.

==Demography==
According to the 2001 census data,<ref>[http://www.cardiff.gov.uk/content.asp?nav=2872,3256,3300,4827&parent_directory_id=2865&id=1985&pagetype=&keyword= 2001 Census Radyr and Morganstown]</ref> Radyr has a total population of 4,658, of which 2,268 are male and 2,390 are female. The average age of the population is 39.7 years. 68.27% of residents are married, with 20.81% having never married. 73.97% declared their religion as [[Christianity]]. 23.97% stated no religion and 0.9% stated [[Islam|Muslim]]. 96.02% stated their [[ethnicity]] as white, 1.76% as [[Asian people|Asian]], 1.03% as mixed race, 1.01% as [[Chinese people|Chinese]], and 0.2% as Black. 15.5% are [[Welsh language]] speakers.

Radyr Lawn Tennis Club was founded in 1914 by twenty Radyr 'Gentlemen' with the help of the Earl of Plymouth Estates. Its initial location was near the railway station but the courts were badly laid. Again with the help of Plymouth Estates, the club lifted the turf from all three grass courts and re-laid it on its current site next to Christ Church on Heol Isaf.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radyrtennis.20m.com/home/History/index.htm|title=History of Radyr LTC|accessdate=2008-07-04}}</ref>

Radyr Cricket Club was founded in 1890 by the Earl of Plymouth who granted a hundred year lease for the current riverside ground to the local residents for a nominal sum. The pavilion was destroyed by fire in 1973 while the team were away on tour. Under the leadership of the new Chairman Keith Terry, a huge fund raising effort was made and a new pavilion opened on the footprint of the old one in 1975. Radyr currently plays in the first division of the [[South Wales Cricket League]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radyrcc.co.uk/history.html|title=A History of Radyr Cricket Club|accessdate=2008-07-04}}</ref>

==Transport==
===Rail===
At the turn of the 20th century Radyr was home to a busy railway from where [[coal]] trains were either transferred onto the [[Taff Vale Railway|Taff Vale line]] to Cardiff Docks, or the Penarth district line, to the docks located at [[Penarth]], 4 miles (6.4 kilometres) southwest of Cardiff city centre. Also, the [[Barry Railway Company]] freight route ran just to the north of Morganstown. To the south-east of Radyr was an extensive railway marshalling yard which included another railway bridge over the Taff to provide an alternative route towards [[Llandaff railway station|Llandaff]].<ref>http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/80403</ref> The sidings were lifted in preparation for a housing development in the 1970s.

[[Radyr railway station]] is still a major regional station, with over 200 trains stopping on a weekday and a recorded annual footfall of over 400,000 passengers per year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arrivatrainswales.co.uk/WorkArea/showcontent.aspx?id=5952|title=Valleys & Cardiff Local Routes Train Times|date=2009-05-01|accessdate=2009-05-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rail-reg.gov.uk/upload/xls/station_usage_0708.xls|title=Station Usage Statistics 2007/2008|date=2009-04-09|publisher=[[Office of Rail Regulation]]|accessdate=2009-05-13}}</ref> Radyr is the northern terminus of the [[Cardiff City Line]].

The B4262 road (Heol Isaf) runs through the centre of Radyr and Morganstown leading northbound to [[Taff's Well]] and the [[A470 road|A470]] towards [[Pontypridd]], and southbound to the [[A4119 road|A4119]] (Llantrisant Road), which links [[Llantrisant]] with [[Danescourt]], [[Llandaff]] and [[Cardiff city centre]].

The M4 corridor around Cardiff was announced in 1971 as a replacement for a northern link road that had been on the statutes since 1947 but never actually constructed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.org/motorway/m4wales.htm|title=The M4 in Wales|publisher=The Motorway Archive|accessdate=2009-05-20}}</ref> The northern "Lisvane and Radyr route" for the M4 was eventually chosen after a number of noisy public enquiries and active objections by residents from both communities.<ref name="M4-Coryton">{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.org/motorway/m4cascor.htm|title=M4 in Wales. Castleton to Coryton (J29 to J32)|publisher=The Motorway Archive|accessdate=2009-05-20}}</ref> The new motorway was completed and opened on 10 July 1980,<ref name="M4-Coryton" /> and passes between Radyr and Morganstown on its east west route between London and [[Carmarthen]].  Due to increased volume of traffic this section is being widened to three lanes. Costing over <U+00A3>71m this work is due to be completed by December 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.m4widening29to32.com/overview.htm|title=M4 Widening - Scheme overview|accessdate=2008-07-12}}</ref> However, Radyr is not directly accessible from the motorway.

==Twin towns==
[[Image:Radyr Twinning Fellowship.jpg|120px|thumb|right|Radyr Twinning Fellowship monument]]
Radyr is twinned with St Philbert De Grand Lieu, a town south-west of [[Nantes]] (Cardiff's twin city) on the southern shores of the [[Lac de Grand Lieu]] in [[Brittany]], [[France]] which has over 300 hectares of vineyards producing [[Muscadet]] wine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://st.philbert.gd.lieu.online.fr/|title=St. Philbert Grand Lieu|accessdate=2008-06-29}}</ref> The first exchange visit took place in May 1986 and Twinning Charters were signed by Chairmen of both community councils.
