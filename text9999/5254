'''Matthew Charlton''' (15 March 1866 &ndash; 8 December 1948) was an [[Australian Labor Party]] politician.

Charlton was born at [[Linton, Victoria|Linton]] in rural Victoria but moved to [[Lambton, New South Wales]] at the age of five. He worked as a coal miner after only a primary education and then married Martha Rollings in 1889. Charlton had an interest in politics from his early middle age, and joined union strikes against wage reductions in 1896.

After a two-year stint in [[Kalgoorlie, Western Australia]], Charlton returned to Lambton and rejoined the local colliery workers' union, becoming its treasurer in 1901. He won a by-election for the NSW seat of [[Electoral district of Waratah (New South Wales)|Waratah]] in 1903 and transferred to [[Electoral district of Northumberland|Northumberland]] in 1904.

In [[Australian federal election, 1910|1910]] Charlton won the seat of [[Division of Hunter|Hunter]] and rose through the ranks of [[Andrew Fisher]]'s government, then staying with the [[Australian Labor Party]] during its period in opposition. Charlton rose through the ranks to become party leader in 1922. He lost his first election campaign, partly because he was hospitalised with illness during its course. In 1924 Charlton was invited to a meeting of the [[League of Nations]] (now [[United Nations]]) but was unsuccessful in getting Australia to adopt the [[Geneva Protocol]], established during the meeting.

Due to union strikes in 1925, Charlton and his party lost the [[Australian federal election, 1925|election]] held that year and he resigned in 1928. He died on 8 December 1948.

== Early life ==
Little is recorded about Charlton's early life, as he grew up in a relatively unknown mining district. It is known, however, that Charlton was born on 15 March 1866 in [[Linton, Victoria]], a small town near [[Ballarat, Victoria|Ballarat]] that today has less than 500 residents.<ref name="linton">{{cite web

|accessdate= 2007-12-12}}</ref> He was born to Matthew Charlton, an English miner from [[Durham, England|Durham]], and Mabel (n<U+00E9>e Foard). In 1871, the five-year-old Charlton's father moved with his family to [[Lambton, New South Wales|Lambton]], a suburb of [[Newcastle, New South Wales]]. After primary education at Lambton Public School, Charlton began work at [[Lambton, New South Wales#Colliery|Lambton Colliery]] as a [[Hurrying|coal trapper]]; a children's-only job opening trapdoors for coal carts.<ref name="trapping">{{cite web

== Emerging interest in politics ==
In 1896 plans to reduce coal workers' wages drew widespread criticism and [[strike action]]. Though Charlton supported the struggle against wage reductions, his efforts failed and he moved, along with many other miners, to the goldfields near [[Kalgoorlie, Western Australia]]. After two years in Western Australia, Charlton returned to Lambton and became an official in the Colliery Employees' Federation,<ref name="collieryunion"> {{cite web

|title=Colliery Employees Federation of the Northern District...
|publisher=New South Wales electronic regional archives
|accessdate= 2007-12-12}}</ref> becoming treasurer in 1901. While working as treasurer, Charlton also prepared arbitration cases. Battling for an improvement in mine workers' conditions, he attended a trade union congress in November 1902. Here he moved for nationalisation of the coal mining industry, believing it would 'eliminate cut-throat competition between owners that depressed miners' wages and conditions'.<ref name="adb" /> His calls were dismissed as too radical but a compromise was drawn up urging state governments to reconsider their use of coal mines.<ref name="adb" />

== State political career ==
Colleagues urged Charlton to stand for the state electoral district of [[Electoral district of Waratah (New South Wales)|Waratah]], and on 5 December 1903 Charlton became the second member for the district in the [[New South Wales Legislative Assembly]]. His representation of that district was short-lived, as the next year he transferred to [[Electoral district of Northumberland|Northumberland]], replacing [[John Norton (Australian journalist)|John Norton]]. Charlton became the unofficial spokesperson for the miners, speaking principally about mining matters in parliament. In 1909 a coal miners' strike struck New South Wales and Charlton was called upon by the Colliery Employees' Federation to represent it in front of a wage board. Charlton was unsuccessful in gaining better conditions for the miners but he did settle the dispute, talking to miners around the state and convincing them to return to work. He resigned from state politics and in [[Australian federal election, 1910|1910]] Charlton wrested the federal [[Division of Hunter]] from the sitting [[Frank Liddell]], beginning 97 years of safe Labor voting.<ref name="adb" /><ref name="indexmembers"> {{cite web

== Early federal career ==
Charlton was an immediate success with [[Andrew Fisher]] and was promoted to the temporary chairmanship of committees in the House in 1913, however Charlton threatened to resign in 1915 over a dispute in government delays in granting the committee increased powers. Fisher mollified him and in 1916 Charlton proved his loyalty to the new Labor leader [[Billy Hughes]] by voting for Hughes' conscription referendum bill, even though he was vehemently opposed to [[conscription]] and fought hard against it.<ref name="adbhughes"> {{Australian Dictionary of Biography

Charlton attempted to deflect attacks made on Hughes to a party conference, but Hughes left the party before a decision could be made.<ref name="adb" /><ref name="adbhughes" />

The new Labor leader [[Frank Tudor]] was a weak leader in health and political prowess. A successor-designate was chosen by the caucus but it was not Charlton. [[T. J. Ryan]] was chosen over him,<ref name="adbryan"> {{Australian Dictionary of Biography

== Leader of the Opposition ==
Charlton offered alternative policies and looked to be favourite until he was hospitalised with illness halfway through the campaign. Labor still won the most seats as a single party, but Charlton was unable to defeat a strong government [[coalition (Australia)|coalition]]. Labor remained in opposition.<ref name="adb" />

Because of great losses during [[World War I]], Charlton opposed military training and commitments of Australian forces. In 1924 Charlton was invited to a [[League of Nations]] (now [[United Nations]]) conference in [[Geneva, Switzerland]]. At the conference Charlton strongly opposed war, and the [[Geneva Protocol]] took form. Upon his return to Australia, Charlton advocated adoption of the protocol, but the government sided with the British and refused to observe it.<ref name="adb" /><ref name="genevacountries">{{cite web

Charlton lost the [[Australian federal election, 1925|1925 election]], largely due to his stance on industrial relations and continual militant union action which plagued his campaign. Charlton always aided in maintaining amicable relations in the party and many times lent his expertise to conflicts within the NSW branch of the Labor Party. He resigned from his positions on 29 March 1928. His successor [[James Scullin]] went on to become the [[Prime Minister of Australia]], something Charlton never managed to do.<ref name="adb" />

== Final years ==
Following his six years of service as Labor leader, Charlton took an interest in local government and became an alderman on the Lambton Council from 1934-38 (prior to its merger with the [[City of Newcastle]]). On 8 December 1948 Charlton died at [[Lambton, New South Wales]], where he grew up and had lived most of his life.<ref name="adb" /><ref name="nswbdmd">[http://www.bdm.nsw.gov.au/cgi-bin/IndexSearch?form=IndexingSearch&cgiurl=%2Fcgi-bin%2FIndex%2FIndexingBirth.cgi&sname=charlton&gname=matthew&fname=&mname=&event=deaths&frange=1948&trange=1948&place=&SessionID=1509230&x=0&y=0 NSW Register of Births, Deaths and Marriages] - Death Record Search (accessed 2008-03-10)</ref>

The [[Division of Charlton]] in the [[Hunter Valley]] region is named in his honour and has been a safe [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] seat since its creation in 1984.<ref name="aecdivhistory">{{cite web
