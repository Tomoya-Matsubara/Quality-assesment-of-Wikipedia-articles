A '''churel''', also spelled as '''churail''', '''chudail''' or '''chudel''' (pronounced chew-rail) ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|<U+0686><U+0691><U+06CC><U+0644>}}}}) (Devanagari: <U+091A><U+0941><U+0921><U+0947><U+0932>) is a female [[ghost]], out of Indian Hindu folklore, especially in [[North India]]. The word "churel" is also used colloquially for a [[witch]].<ref name="Chawla1994">{{cite book|author=Janet Chawla|title=Child-bearing and culture: women centered revisioning of the traditional midwife : the dai as a ritual practitioner|page=15|year=1994|publisher=Indian Social Institute}}</ref> Women who die in childbirth or pregnancy due to the negligence of her relatives are often described turning into churels, who return to seek their vendetta and suck the blood of their male relatives.

The churel is described to have a hideous and terrible appearance, however she appears in the devious disguise of a youthful, beautiful maiden to lure young men. She drains their blood and their virility, transforming them into aged men. She dwells and prowls in places associated with death and filth.

Various precautions are advised to avoid a churel. The best solution is to prevent the creation of a churel. Special rites and rituals are performed in the burial of any woman who is likely to become a churel. The corpse may be bound or protective nails or structures used to restrict the would-be churel to her burial grounds. Measures are undertaken so that at least the churel does not find her way back to her house to torment her family.

She has an unnaturally long and thick black tongue and thick, rough lips; though sometimes she is reported as having no mouth at all. Sometimes, churels are described to have pig faces with large fangs or human-like faces with sharp tusks. However, a churel may be a shape-shifter.

==Prevention and remedies==
The best solution prescribed to avoid a churel is to prevent her creation. This means taking good care of the pregnant woman.<ref name="MaberryKramer2009"/> However, if the woman dies, the creation of a churel can be still prevented. The forming of a churel by burying the corpse of any woman who is likely to become one, instead of the usual Hindu cremation. Rites and rituals of her burial should be performed with utmost care. The woman should be remember in songs and prayers.<ref name="MaberryKramer2009"/><ref name="melton"/> Sometimes, she may be buried face down.<ref name="Buckland2009"/>

Precautionary measures are taken even if the woman transforms into a churel. The corpse may be carried out of the house from the side door, rather than the front door so that the deceased does not find her way back in the house.<ref name="melton"/> Some families would sprinkle mustard or millet seeds on the grave to ensure that the churel did not visit the old family house.<ref>{{Cite journal  | last = Hildburgh  | first = W.

The churel is believed to return to her house only if she manages to collect all of the scattered seeds or wool.<ref name="Saletore1981"/>

Measures were taken to restrain the churel to her burial grounds. Four nails are fixed at the four corners of the burial site and red flowers are planted on it.<ref name="melton"/> Iron nails were also driven on the house's threshold or at the end of the street in the village boundary, that the funeral precession travels.<ref name="melton"/><ref name="Saletore1981"/> The corpse may also be bound to restrict the churel's movement. In [[Punjab]], a woman who died during childbirth had her hands and feet nailed, her feet shackled in chains and red pepper smeared in her eyes. Some would may even break her legs and turn her feet backwards, chain the big toes together or tie the feet in iron rings.<ref name="melton"/> Sometimes, instead of the corpse, the legs on the cot on which the death happened are bound under the bier.<ref name="Saletore1981"/>

However, in some cases an exorcism has been needed over the burial site.<ref name="book1"/> Hindu priests use prayers, incense and offerings to ward her off, but this is not a permanent solution. The churel may return months or years later.<ref name="MaberryKramer2009"/> "Stonehenge-like structures" are built at the entrances of villages in the south, to prevent churels entering the village.<ref name="Bane"/>
