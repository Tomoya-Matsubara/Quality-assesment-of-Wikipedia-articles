'''''The Dark Side of the Moon''''' (titled ''Dark Side of the Moon'' in the 1993 [[Compact Disc|CD]] edition) is a [[concept album]] by the English [[progressive rock]] [[Musical ensemble|band]] [[Pink Floyd]]. It was released on 17&nbsp;March 1973 in the United States and 24&nbsp;March 1973 in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{Citation | title = "There's someone in my head, but it's not me ..." | url = http://www.floydianslip.com/discs/dsotm.htm | last = Bailey | first = Craig | publisher = floydianslip.com | date = 2003-08-26 | accessdate = 2009-03-10}}</ref>

''The Dark Side of the Moon'' built on the ideas Pink Floyd had explored in their live shows and recordings, but it lacked the extended instrumental excursions which had characterised their work following the departure of founding member, principal composer and lyricist, [[Syd Barrett]]. The album's themes include conflict, greed, aging, and [[Mental disorder|mental illness]] (or "insanity"), the latter partly inspired by Barrett's deteriorating mental state.<ref name="makingof">{{Citation | title = Classic Albums: The Making of The Dark Side of the Moon | medium = DVD | url = http://www.amazon.com/Classic-Albums-Making-Dark-Side/dp/B0000AOV85 | publisher = Eagle Rock Entertainment | date = 2003-08-26 }}</ref>

Developed during the band's live concert tours, it was recorded between 1972 and 1973 at [[Abbey Road Studios]] in [[London]], making use of some of the most advanced studio techniques of the time.  Innovative ideas included [[multitrack]]ing, [[Analog synthesizer|analogue synthesizers]], and [[tape loop]]s.

The band's most commercially successful release, ''The Dark Side of the Moon'' is often considered to be their ''[[magnum opus]]'',<ref>{{Harvnb|Harris|2006|pp=10&ndash;11.}}</ref> and is frequently ranked by music critics as one of the greatest and most influential albums of all time.

==History==
Following the release of ''[[Meddle]]'', in December 1971 the band assembled for an upcoming tour of Britain, Japan, and the United States.  Rehearsing in Broadhurst Gardens in London, there was the looming prospect of a new album although their priority at that time was the creation of new material.<ref>{{Harvnb|Harris|2006|pp=71&ndash;72.}}</ref>  In a band meeting at drummer [[Nick Mason]]'s home in London, bassist [[Roger Waters]] proposed that a new album could form part of the tour.  Waters' idea was for an album dealing with things that "make people mad", focusing on the pressures faced by the band during their arduous lifestyle and dealing with the apparent mental problems suffered by former band member Syd Barrett.<ref name=darkside30/>

{{Quote|I really can't remember exactly how it happened<U+2014>just that at some point Roger came in and said that instead of just one or two lyrics for individual songs that we had already been working on he had got an idea that was going to run through the whole album.  Having Roger coming up with a cohesive idea of what the whole thing was going to be about was very good.  We had explored some of that area before when we did a thing called "The Man and the Journey" which was a live thing we did in 1969.  That was the story of the life of a person.  But I think we all thought<U+2014>and Roger definitely thought<U+2014>that a lot of the lyrics that we had been using were a little too indirect.  There was definitely a feeling that the words were going to be very clear and specific.|[[David Gilmour]]|<ref name=gilmour>{{Citation |first= John|last= Harris |title='Dark Side' at 30: David Gilmour  |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/pinkfloyd/articles/story/5937468/dark_side_at_30_david_gilmour|work=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=2003-03-12 |accessdate=2009-02-18 }}</ref>}}

All four members of Pink Floyd<U+2014>bassist and principal lyricist Roger Waters, guitarist David Gilmour, drummer Nick Mason and keyboardist [[Richard Wright (musician)|Richard Wright]]<U+2014>participated in the writing and [[Record producer|production]] of the album, a rarity in later Pink Floyd albums.  Waters created the early [[Demo (music)|demo tracks]] at his home, in a small recording studio he had built in his garden shed.  Some parts of the new album were taken from previously unused material: the opening line of "[[Breathe (Pink Floyd song)|Breathe]]" came from an earlier work by Waters and [[Ron Geesin]] written for the soundtrack of ''[[Music from The Body|The Body]]'';<ref>{{Harvnb|Harris|2006|pp=73&ndash;74.}}</ref> the basic structure of "[[Us and Them]]" was taken from a piece originally written for the film ''[[Zabriskie Point (film)|Zabriski Point]]''.<ref name="makingof"/>  The new album was developed during rehearsals and provisionally named ''The Dark Side of the Moon'', but on discovering that title had already been used by another band, [[Medicine Head]], it was temporarily changed to ''Eclipse''.<ref name="Poveyp154">{{Harvnb|Povey|2007|p=154.}}</ref>

{{Quote|At one time, it was called ''Eclipse'' because Medicine Head did an album called Dark Side of the Moon.  But, that didn't sell well, so what the hell.  I was against ''Eclipse'' and we felt a bit annoyed because we had already thought of the title before Medicine Head came out.  Not annoyed at them but because we wanted to use the title.|David Gilmour|<ref name="Poveyp154"/><ref name="Schaffner" />}}

Waters is credited as the author of all the album's lyrics,<ref name="sleeve notes"/> making ''The Dark Side of the Moon'' the first of five consecutive Pink Floyd albums with lyrics credited only to him.<ref name="sleeve notes">{{Citation | title = Pink Floyd <U+2014> Dark Side of the Moon <U+2014> sleeve notes | publisher = TRO Hampshire House Publishing Corp. | year = 1973}}</ref><ref>The sleeve notes for ''Wish You Were Here'', ''Animals'', and ''The Wall'' credit Roger Waters as sole lyricist.  ''The Final Cut'' is considered to be a ''de facto'' Waters album.</ref>  When in 2003 he was asked if his input on the album was "organising [the] ideas and frameworks" and David Gilmour's was "the music", Waters replied:

{{Quote|That's crap. There's no question that Dave needs a vehicle to bring out the best of his guitar playing.  And he is a great guitar player.  But the idea which he's tried to propagate over the years that he's somehow more musical than I am is absolute fucking nonsense.  It's an absurd notion but people seem quite happy to believe it.|Roger Waters|<ref name=darkside30>{{Citation |first= Harris|last= John|title='Dark Side' at 30: Roger Waters  |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/pinkfloyd/articles/story/5937470/dark_side_at_30_roger_waters |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=2003-03-12 |accessdate=2009-02-18 }}</ref><ref>Gilmour's comments on this matter may be found on page 7 of John Harris' book</ref>}}

[[File:Rainbow theatre london.jpg|right|thumb|The Rainbow Theatre in London]]
For their upcoming tour, they purchased new equipment which included a mixing desk, a quadraphonic sound system, and a custom-built lighting rig.  The band's nine tons <!-- short tonnes or long tonnes? -->of equipment was transported in three [[Truck|lorries]].  This was the first time the band had taken an entire album of material on the road, but it allowed them to refine and improve their material.  In preparation, they rehearsed at a warehouse in London owned by [[The Rolling Stones]], and then at the [[Rainbow (London)|Rainbow Theatre]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Harris|2006|pp=85&ndash;86.}}</ref>  The album was performed live in the same order in which it would eventually be recorded, but obvious differences included the lack of [[synthesizer]]s in tracks such as "[[On the Run (Pink Floyd song)|On the Run]]", and [[Bible]] readings in place of [[Clare Torry]]'s vocals on "[[The Great Gig in the Sky]]".  The tour was widely acclaimed by the public, and following a performance at the Rainbow theatre, the band received critical acclaim from the press;<ref name="Poveyp155">{{Harvnb|Povey|2007|pp=154&ndash;155.}}</ref> Michael Wale of ''[[The Times]]'' described the piece as "... bringing tears to the eyes.

Throughout 1972 the band toured Europe and North America, introducing continual enhancements to both the scale and quality of the performances.<ref>{{Harvnb|Povey|2007|p=159.}}</ref>  Studio sessions were squeezed between tour dates; the tour began in England on 20&nbsp;January, but in late February the band began recording music for ''[[La Vall<U+00E9>e (film)|La Vall<U+00E9>e]]'', a French film by director [[Barbet Schroeder]].<ref name="Poveyp155"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Povey|2007|p=166.}}</ref><ref>This material was later released under the title [[Obscured by Clouds]]</ref>  They then performed in [[Japan]] and returned in March to complete work on ''La Vall<U+00E9>e''.  Several dates in North America followed before the band returned to begin recording the album, from 24&nbsp;May<U+2013>25&nbsp;June.  After more concerts in Europe and North America, the band again returned on 9&nbsp;January 1973 to complete work on the album.<ref>{{Harvnb|Povey|2007|pp=164&ndash;173.}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Reising|2005|p=60.}}</ref>

==Concept==
The album builds upon previous experiments Pink Floyd had attempted in their live shows and recordings, but without the extended instrumental excursions which, according to critic [[David Fricke]], had become characteristic of the band after founding member Syd Barrett left in 1968.  Guitarist David Gilmour, Barrett's replacement, would later refer to these instrumentals as "that psychedelic noodling stuff".  Both Gilmour and Waters cite 1971's ''[[Meddle]]'' as a turning point toward what would be realised on ''The Dark Side of the Moon''.<ref name="makingof"/>

The album's themes include conflict, greed, aging and mental illness (or "insanity"), the latter inspired in part by Barrett's deteriorating mental state; he had been the band's principal composer and lyricist.<ref name="makingof"/>  The album is notable for its use of [[Musique concrete|musique concr<U+00E8>te]] and conceptual, philosophical lyrics, as found in much of the band's other work.

The release of ''The Dark Side of the Moon'' is seen as a symbolic point in the history of rock music.  Beginning and ending with a fading heartbeat, there are five tracks on each side, each one linked to reflect the various stages of human life.  The album explores the nature of the human experience and according to Waters, "empathy".<ref name="makingof"/>  "[[Speak to Me]]" and "Breathe" together stress the mundane and futile elements of life along with the ever-present threat of madness and the importance of living one's own life<U+2014>"Don't be afraid to care".<ref>{{Harvnb|Whiteley|1992|pp=105&ndash;106.}}</ref>  "On the Run", a synthesizer-driven instrumental, evokes the stress and anxiety of modern travel, in particular Wright's fear of flying, by shifting the scene to an airport.<ref>{{Harvnb|Harris|2006|pp=78&ndash;79.}}</ref>  "[[Time (Pink Floyd song)|Time]]" looks at the manner in which the passage of time can control one's life, followed by a retreat into solitude and withdrawal in "[[Breathe (Reprise)]]".  The first side of the album ends with "The Great Gig in the Sky", a soulful metaphor for death.  Opening with the sound of [[cash register]]s and loose change, the first track on side two, "[[Money (Pink Floyd song)|Money]]", mocks greed and [[consumerism]], with tongue-in-cheek lyrics and wealth-related [[sound effect]]s.  The track has been the most successful on the album, with several cover versions produced by other bands.<ref>{{Harvnb|Whiteley|1992|p=111.}}</ref>  "Us and Them" addresses [[ethnocentrism]] and [[conflict]],<ref name="Schaffner">{{Harvnb|Schaffner|1992|pp=170&ndash;184.}}</ref> and the use of simple dichotomies to describe personal relationships.  "[[Brain Damage (song)|Brain Damage]]" looks at a [[mental illness]] resulting from the elevation of fame and success above the needs of the self.  In particular the line "And if the band you're in starts playing a diff'rent tune" reflects the mental breakdown of former band-mate Syd Barrett.  The album ends with "[[Eclipse (song)|Eclipse]]", which espouses the concepts of [[alterity]] ("otherness") and unity, while forcing the listener to recognise the common traits shared by humanity.<ref name="Reisingpp181184">{{Harvnb|Reising|2005|pp=181&ndash;184.}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Whiteley|1992|p=116.}}</ref>

==Recording==
[[Image:Parsonsquad.jpg|thumb|right|[[Alan Parsons]] mixing ''Dark Side of the Moon'' in [[quadraphonic|quadraphonic sound]]]]
The album was recorded at [[Abbey Road Studios]], in two sessions, between May 1972 and January 1973.  Staff engineer [[Alan Parsons]] had previously worked with the band on ''[[Atom Heart Mother]]''.<ref name="anotherphase">{{Citation | title = Another Phase of the Moon page 1 | url = http://www.soundandvisionmag.com/features/444/another-phase-of-the-moon.html | last = Richardson | first = Ken | publisher = soundandvisionmag.com | date = 2003-05 | accessdate = 2009-03-19}}</ref>  The recording sessions made use of the most advanced studio techniques of the time.  The studio was capable of [[Multitrack recording|sixteen track]] mixes which offered a greater degree of flexibility, although the band would often use so many tracks that to make more space available second generation copies were made.<ref name="Harrispp101102">{{Harvnb|Harris|2006|pp=101&ndash;102.}}</ref>

Beginning on 1&nbsp;June, the first track to be recorded was "Us and Them", followed six days later by "Money".  Rogers had created [[Sound effect|effects]] [[Tape loop|loop]]s from recordings of various money-related objects, including coins thrown into a food-mixing bowl taken from his wife's pottery studio. These loops were later re-recorded to take advantage of the band's decision to record a [[Quadraphonic sound|quadraphonic]] mix of the album (Parsons has since expressed dissatisfaction with the result of this mix, attributed to a lack of time and the paucity of available multi-track tape recorders).<ref name="anotherphase"/>  "Time" and "The Great Gig in the Sky" were the next pieces to be recorded, followed by a two-month break during which the band spent time with their families and prepared for an upcoming tour of the US.<ref>{{Harvnb|Harris|2006|pp=103&ndash;108.}}</ref>

Returning from the US in January 1973, they recorded "Brain Damage", "Eclipse", "[[Any Colour You Like]]" and "On the Run", simultaneously fine-tuning the work they had already done in the previous sessions.  A foursome of female vocalists was assembled to sing on "Brain Damage", "Eclipse" and "Time", and saxophonist [[Dick Parry]] was booked to play on "Us and Them" and "Money".  Once these sessions were complete, the band began a tour of Europe.<ref>{{Harvnb|Harris|2006|pp=109&ndash;114.}}</ref>

Recording sessions were regularly interrupted; Roger Waters, a supporter of [[Arsenal F.C.]], would regularly break from recording to see his team compete.  The band would often stop work to watch [[Monty Python's Flying Circus]] on the television, leaving Parsons to work on any material recorded up to that point.<ref name="Harrispp101102"/>  David Gilmour has since disputed this claim; in an interview in 2003 he said: "We would sometimes watch them but when we were on a roll, we would get on."<ref>{{Citation | title = There is no dark side of the moon, really... | url = http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/06/23/1056220536301.html | last = Waldon | first = Steve | publisher = theage.com | date = 2003-06-24 | accessdate = 2009-03-19}}</ref><ref name="parsons"/>

===Instrumentation===
[[File:EMS VCS 3.jpg|right|thumb|upright|The [[EMS VCS 3]] (Putney) Synthesizer]]
Along with the conventional [[rock music|rock]] band instrumentation, Pink Floyd added prominent [[synthesizers]] to their sound.  For example, the band experimented with an [[EMS VCS 3]] on "Brain Damage" and "Any Colour You Like", and a [[EMS Synthi A|Synthi A]] on "Time" and "On the Run".<!-- VCS 3 and Synthi A are technically the same, only using different housings! -->  The band also devised and recorded some unconventional noises: an assistant engineer running around the studio's echo chamber (during "On the Run"),<ref>{{Harvnb|Harris|2006|pp=118&ndash;120.}}</ref> and a specially-treated [[bass drum]] made to sound like a human [[heart rate|heartbeat]] (during "Speak to Me", "On the Run", "Time", and "Eclipse").  The heartbeat is most audible as the intro and the outro to the album, but it can also be heard underneath most of the album<U+2014>the song "Time" and "On the Run" has the low thudding underneath the rest.<ref name="makingof"/>  The myriad clocks ticking then chiming simultaneously (during "Time") were recorded as a [[Quadraphonic sound|quadraphonic]] test by Parsons, not specifically for the album.<ref>{{Harvnb|Schaffner|1992|p=157.}}</ref>
{{Sound sample box align right|Music samples:}}
{{Listen|filename=Dark side of the moon money sample wikipedia.ogg|description="Money" makes use of tape loops and a 7/8 [[Time signature|time signature]].|title="Money"|format=[[Ogg]]}}{{sample box end}}
The album is also notable for the metronomic sound effects during "Speak to Me" and the opening of "Money". For "Money", this was achieved by splicing together Waters' recordings of clinking coins, tearing paper, a ringing cash register and a clicking adding machine to create a [[beat (music)|7-beat]] [[tape loop|effects loop]] (later adapted to four tracks in order to create a "walk around the room" effect in quadraphonic presentations of the album).<ref>{{Harvnb|Harris|2006|pp=104&ndash;105.}}</ref>  At times the sonic experimentation on the album required the engineers and all band members to operate the mixing console's faders simultaneously to mix down the intricately assembled [[multitrack recording]]s of several of the songs (particularly "On the Run").<ref name="makingof"/>

===Voices===
Perhaps one of the less noticeable aspects of the album is the ability of Richard Wright and David Gilmour to perfectly harmonise with each other, such as on "Us and Them" and "Time".  In ''[[Classic Albums: Pink Floyd - The Making of The Dark Side of the Moon|The Making of The Dark Side of the Moon]]'', a 2003 DVD documentary on the making of the album, Roger Waters attributes this to the fact that, along with their talent, their voices both sound extremely similar.  To take advantage of this, Parsons perfected the use of other studio techniques such as the [[doubletracking]] of vocals and guitars, and other vocal multitracking which allowed Gilmour to harmonise with himself. He also made prominent use of [[flanging]] and phase shifting effects on vocals and instruments, odd trickery with [[reverberation|reverb]]<ref name="makingof"/> and the panning of sounds between channels (most notable in the [[quadraphonic]] mix of "On the Run", when the sound of the [[Hammond B3]] organ played through a [[Leslie speaker]] rapidly swirls around the listener).<ref>{{Harvnb|Povey|2005|p=161.}}</ref>

The album's credits include, "Vocals on "The Great Gig in the Sky" by [[Clare Torry]]".  Torry was a cover singer who had worked on a variety of pop material, and after hearing her perform, Parsons invited her to the studio to sing on "The Great Gig in the Sky".  In a few short takes on a Sunday night she improvised a wordless melody to accompany Richard Wright's emotive piano solo.  For her contribution she was paid <U+00A3>30, equivalent to about <U+00A3>{{Formatprice|{{Inflation|UK|30|1972|r=-1}}|0}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}},{{Inflation-fn|UK}} and given a credit for the track's vocals.<ref>{{Citation | title =  Clare Torry <U+2014> October 2005 <U+2014> Brain Damage exclusive | url = http://www.brain-damage.co.uk/other-related-interviews/clare-torry-october-2005-brain-damage-excl-3.html | last = Harris | first = John | publisher = brain-damage.co.uk | work = Dark Side Of The Moon | date = 2005-10 | accessdate = 2009-03-20}}</ref>  In 2004, Torry sued [[EMI]] and Pink Floyd for song writing [[royalties]], claiming that she co-wrote "The Great Gig in the Sky" with keyboardist Richard Wright.  The [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] concluded that Torry was correct but the terms of the lawsuit were not disclosed.<ref>{{Citation |title=Seventies Singer |url=http://www.freelanceuk.com/news/1006.shtml |date=2005-04-14|accessdate=2009-01-23 }}</ref><ref name="Torry">{{Citation | title = Clare Torry wins settlement against Pink Floyd  | url = http://www.brain-damage.co.uk/archive/clare-torry-wins-settlement-against-pink-floyd.html | date = 2005-04-15 | publisher = brain-damage.co.uk | accessdate = 2009-03-17}}</ref>  All post-2005 pressings including "The Great Gig in the Sky" credit both Wright and Torry for the song.<ref name="Povey">{{Harvnb|Povey|2007|p=n/a.}}</ref>

Snippets of voices both between and over the music are a feature of the album.  During recording sessions, Roger Waters recruited both the staff and the temporary occupants of the studio to answer a series of questions printed on [[flashcards]].  The interviewees were placed in front of a microphone in a darkened studio room and shown such questions as "What's your favourite colour?" and "What's your favourite food?", before moving on to themes more central to the album (such as madness, violence, and death).  Questions were answered in the order they were presented, provoking some surprising responses.  For example, the question "When was the last time you were violent?" was immediately followed by "Were you in the right?"<ref name="makingof"/>  The recording of road manager Roger "The Hat" Manifold was the only one obtained through a conventional sit-down interview as initially the band could not find him, and by then the flashcards had been mislaid.  His responses included "give 'em a quick, short, sharp shock&nbsp;..." and "live for today, gone tomorrow, that's me&nbsp;..."  Another roadie, Chris Adamson, was on tour with Pink Floyd at the time and recorded his explicit [[diatribe]] that opens the album<U+2014>"I've been mad for fucking years<U+2014>absolutely years".  Pink Floyd's road manager Peter Watts (father of actress [[Naomi Watts]])<ref>{{Citation | title = How Naomi told her mum about Oscar | url = http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/02/22/1077384633676.html | last = Sams | first = Christine | publisher = smh.com.au | date = 2004-02-23 | accessdate = 2009-03-17}}</ref> contributed the repeated laughter during "Brain Damage" and "Speak to Me". The monologue about "geezers" who were "cruisin' for a bruisin{{'"}} was delivered by Peter's second wife, Puddie (short for Patricia) Watts.<ref>{{Harvnb|Harris|2006|pp=127&ndash;134.}}</ref> The responses "And I am not frightened of dying, any time will do, I don't mind. Why should I be frightened of dying, there's no reason for it, you've got to go some time" (during "The Great Gig in the Sky") and closing words "there is no dark side of the Moon really&nbsp;... as a matter of fact it's all dark" (over the "Eclipse" heartbeats) came from the studios' Irish doorman, Gerry O'Driscoll.  [[Sir Paul McCartney|Paul]] and [[Linda McCartney]] were also interviewed, but their answers were not included on the album.<ref>{{Citation | title =  10 things you probably didn't know about Pink Floyd | url = http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article5029255.ece | last = Blake | first = Mark | date = 2008-10-28 | publisher = entertainment.timesonline.co.uk |accessdate = 2009-03-17}}</ref>  McCartney's band mate [[Henry McCullough]] contributed the famous line "I don't know, I was really drunk at the time" (during the segue between "Money" and "Us and Them").<ref>{{Citation | title = Rock: Henry McCullough  | url = http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/article617710.ece?token=null&offset=0&page=1 | last = Price | first = Stephen | date = 2006-08-27 | publisher = entertainment.timesonline.co.uk | accessdate = 2009-03-16}}</ref>

===Completion===
Following the completion of the dialogue sessions, producer [[Chris Thomas (record producer)|Chris Thomas]] was hired to provide "a fresh pair of ears".  Waters and Gilmour had a minor disagreement over the style of the mix, the former preferring a "dry" and "clean" mix, and the latter preferring a subtler and more "echoey" mix.  Nick Mason has agreed with this recollection, but Thomas later claimed there were no such disagreements:

{{Quote|There was no difference in opinion between them, I don't remember Roger once saying that he wanted less echo.  In fact, there were never any hints that they were later going to fall out.  It was a very creative atmosphere.  A lot of fun.|Chris Thomas|<ref>{{Harvnb|Harris|2006|p=135.}}</ref>}}

Although the truth remains unclear, Thomas' intervention resulted in a welcome compromise between Waters and Gilmour, leaving both entirely satisfied with the end product.  Thomas was responsible for significant changes to the album, including the perfect timing of the echo used on "Us and Them".  He was also present for the recording of "The Great Gig in the Sky", although it was Alan Parsons who was responsible for hiring Clare Torry.<ref>{{Harvnb|Harris|2006|pp=134&ndash;140.}}</ref>

Interviewed in 2006, when asked if he felt his goals had been accomplished in the studio, Roger Waters said:

{{Quote|When the record was finished I took a reel-to-reel copy home with me and I remember playing it for my wife then, and I remember her bursting into tears when it was finished. And I thought, "This has obviously struck a chord somewhere", and I was kinda pleased by that.  You know when you<U+2019>ve done something, certainly if you create a piece of music, you then hear it with fresh ears when you play it for somebody else. And at that point I thought to myself, "Wow, this is a pretty complete piece of work", and I had every confidence that people would respond to it.|Roger Waters|<ref name="Billboard"/>}}

{{Quote|It felt like the whole band were working together.  It was a creative time.  We were all very open.|Richard Wright|<ref>{{Harvnb|Harris|2006|p=3.}}</ref>}}

Both Roger Waters and David Gilmour have on occasion downplayed the contribution of Alan Parsons to the success of the album, although Nick Mason has praised his role.<ref>{{Harvnb|Harris|2006|pp=173&ndash;174.}}</ref>  Reflecting on its success, in an interview for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' Parsons said: 

{{Quote|I think they all felt that I managed to hang the rest of my career on Dark Side of the Moon, which has an element of truth to it.

==LP packaging==
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:DSODMgatefold.jpg|thumb|right|The gatefold sleeve of the original LP version.]] -->
The album was originally released in a gatefold LP sleeve designed by [[Hipgnosis]] and [[George Hardie (artist)|George Hardie]], of Nicholas Thirkell Associates, and bore Hardie's iconic refracting [[Prism (optics)|prism]] on the cover.  

Hipgnosis had designed several of the band's previous albums, with controversial results; EMI had reacted with confusion when faced with the cover designs for ''[[Atom Heart Mother]]'' and ''[[Obscured by Clouds]]'', as they had expected to see traditional designs which included lettering and words.  Designers [[Storm Thorgeson]] and [[Aubrey Powell]] were able to ignore such criticism as they were employed by the band.  For ''The Dark Side of the Moon'' Richard Wright instructed them to come up with something "smarter, neater<U+2014>more classy."  The prism design was inspired by a photograph that Thorgeson had seen in a brainstorming session with Powell.  The artwork was created by Hipgnosis employee George Hardie.  Hipgnosis offered the band a choice of about ten designs, but all four members agreed that the prism was by far the best.  The prism design represents three elements; the band's stage lighting, the album lyrics, and Richard Wright's request for a "simple and bold" design.<ref name="makingof"/>  Added shortly afterward, the gatefold design represents the heartbeat used throughout the album, and the back of the album cover contains Thorgeson's suggestion of another prism recombining the spectrum of light, facilitating interesting layouts of the sleeve in record shops.<ref name="Harrispp141147">{{Harvnb|Harris|2006|pp=141&ndash;147.}}</ref>

Inside the sleeve were two posters, one bearing pictures of the band in concert with the words PINK FLOYD broken up and scattered about, and the other an image of the [[Giza pyramid complex|Great Pyramids of Giza]] taken on [[Infrared photography|infrared film]] by Powell and Thorgeson.<ref name="Harrispp141147"/>  Also included was a sheet of stickers of the pyramids.  In a 1991 issue of ''Rolling Stone'', the refracting prism album cover was #35 on ''Rolling Stone''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s list of the 100 greatest album covers of all time.<ref name="RS Magazine">{{Citation | title = List of Rolling Stone Magazine's 100 Greatest Album Covers of All Time | url = http://rateyourmusic.com/list/fedderedder/rolling_stones_100_greatest_album_covers | publisher = rateyourmusic.com | accessdate = 2009-03-17}}</ref>  In 2003 [[VH1]] named the album's cover as their 4th-greatest album cover of all time,<ref name="Vh1">{{Citation | title = The Greatest: 50 Greatest Album Covers | url = http://www.vh1.com/photos/gallery/?fid=1478677&pid=1542318 | publisher = vh1.com | accessdate = 2009-03-17}}</ref> and in 2009 listeners of the UK radio station Planet Rock voted it the greatest album cover of all time.<ref>{{Citation | title = Top Rock Album | url = http://www.planetrock.com/top-rock-album.htm | publisher = planetrock.com | accessdate = 2009-04-14}}</ref>

==Reception==
[[Image:DarkSideOfTheMoon1973.jpg|thumb|Dark Side of the Moon, Earls Court 1973]]
The album was released in March 1973, but with the exception of Wright, the band boycotted the press reception at the [[London Planetarium]], as the quadraphonic mix was not yet complete.  The stereo mix of the album was presented through a poor-quality [[public address]] system.<ref name="Poveyp160">{{Harvnb|Povey|2007|p=160.}}</ref>  Critic Roy Hollingworth for ''[[Melody Maker]]'' described side one of the album as: "... so utterly confused with itself it was difficult to follow", but went on to praise side two, writing "The songs, the sounds, the rhythms were solid and sound, Saxophone hit the air, the band rocked and rolled, and then gushed and tripped away into the night."<ref>{{Citation | title = Historical info - 1973 review, Melody Maker | url = http://www.pinkfloyd.com/dsotm/content/setup.html | last = Hollingworth | first = Roy | publisher = pinkfloyd.com | year = 1973 | accessdate = 2009-03-30}}</ref>  In his 1973 album review for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine, [[Lloyd Grossman]] wrote: "a fine album with a textural and conceptual richness that not only invites, but demands involvement".<ref>{{Citation | title = Pink Floyd <U+2014> Dark Side of the Moon | url = http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/126211/review/6212432?utm_source=Rhapsody&utm_medium=CDreview | date = 1973-05-24 | last = Grossman | first = Lloyd | authorlink = Lloyd Grossman | publisher = rollingstone.com | accessdate = 2009-05-23}}</ref>   Aided by a tour of the USA, the album reached the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' album chart #1 spot on 28&nbsp;April 1973.<ref>{{Harvnb|Harris|2006|pp=156&ndash;157.}}</ref>  "Money" was released as a single, eventually reaching #13 on the Hot 100.<ref name="Money13">{{Citation | title = Top Music Charts - Hot 100 - Billboard 200 - Music Genre Sales | url = http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/esearch/chart_display.jsp?cfi=379&cfgn=Singles&cfn=The+Billboard+Hot+100&ci=3070731&cdi=8855217&cid=05%2F19%2F1973 | publisher = billboard.com | accessdate = 2009-04-04}}</ref>

I think that when it was finished, everyone thought it was the best thing we'd ever done to date, and everyone was very pleased with it, but there's no way that anyone felt it was five times as good as ''Meddle'', or eight times as good as ''Atom Heart Mother'', or the sort of figures that it has in fact sold.

In the USA the [[Gramophone record|LP]] was released before the introduction of [[Music recording sales certification|platinum awards]] on 1&nbsp;January 1976.  It therefore held only a gold disc until 16&nbsp;February 1990 when, following the release of the album on [[CD]], it was certified 11x platinum.  On 4&nbsp;June 1998 the [[RIAA]] certified the album 15x platinum,<ref name="Povey"/> denoting sales of fifteen million in the United States alone<U+2014>making it their biggest-selling album there (''[[The Wall]]'' is 23x platinum, but as a double album this signifies sales of 11.5&nbsp;million).<ref>{{Harvnb|Ruhlmann|2004|p=175.}}</ref>  "Time", "Money" and "Us and Them" remain radio favourites, with "Money" having sold well as a single in its own right.<ref name="Money13"/>  Industry sources suggest that worldwide sales of the album total about forty million.

According to an 2 August 2006 ''Wall Street Journal'' article, although the album was released in 1973, it has sold 7.7&nbsp;million copies since 1991 in the USA alone and continues to log 9,600&nbsp;sales per week domestically.<ref name="wsj1">{{Citation|url=http://online.wsj.com/services/article/SB115447712983624018-search.html?KEYWORDS=%22Dark+Side+of+the+Moon%22&COLLECTION=wsjie/6month|title=Many companies still cling to big hits to drive earnings|accessdate=2006-12-23|publisher=Dow Jones & Company, Inc|author=Gomes, Lee|work=The Wall Street Journal}}</ref>  To this day, it occupies a prominent spot on ''Billboard''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Pop Catalogue Chart.

The success of the album brought previously unknown wealth to all four members of the band; both Richard Wright and Roger Waters bought large country houses, and Nick Mason became a collector of upmarket cars.<ref>{{Harvnb|Harris|2006|pp=164&ndash;166.}}</ref>  Some of the profits were invested in the production of ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]''.

==Reissues and remastering==
[[File:Dark side of the moon mobile fidelity cd.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab|Mobile Fidelity]] CD Ultradisc release of the album]]
In 1979 ''The Dark Side of the Moon'' was released as a remastered [[LP album|LP]] by [[Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab]] (MFSL).  It has since been re-released several times on CD. MFSL remastered and re-released the album again in CD Ultradisc form in April 1988,<ref name="Povey"/> with new, factory-sealed examples of this version selling for over $100 on the Internet in 2009.<ref>{{Citation | title = List of Mobile Fidelity CD copies of The Dark Side of the Moon at Amazon | url = http://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/B000000IRB | publisher = amazon.com | accessdate = 2009-03-28}}</ref>

The album was re-released as a remastered CD in the 1992 box set ''[[Shine On (Pink Floyd)|Shine On]]''.<ref name="Povey"/>  This version was itself re-released as a 20th-anniversary box set edition with postcards.  Some have suggested that on later CD pressings a faintly audible orchestral version of [[The Beatles]]'s "[[Ticket to Ride]]" can be heard after "Eclipse", over the heartbeats that close the album.  This may have been the consequence of a [[remastering]] error.<ref name="Povey"/>  This is not audible on the original vinyl.

The original quadrophonic mix (Q4SHVL-804) was commissioned by [[EMI]] but not endorsed by the band.<ref name="anotherphase"/>  It languished in obscurity for about 30&nbsp;years until a [[DVD-Audio]] [[Bootleg recording|bootleg]] surfaced.  The disc purports to be derived from the original studio masters, mixed by an anonymous individual who claimed to be a "professional sound engineer".<ref>{{Citation | title = DVD-Audio Review: Pink Floyd <U+2014> <U+2018>Dark Side of the Moon' | url = http://www.highfidelityreview.com/reviews/review.asp?reviewnumber=12583627 | last = Satullo | first = Nicholas D. | publisher = highfidelityreview.com | date = 2006-09-12 | accessdate = 2009-03-28}}</ref>  To celebrate the 30th anniversary of the album's release, an updated surround version was released in 2003.  Some surprise was expressed when the band elected not to use the older quadraphonic mix from Parsons (mixed shortly after the original release), and instead chose to have their current engineer [[James Guthrie (record producer)|James Guthrie]] create a new [[5.1]]&nbsp;channel surround sound mix on the [[SACD]] format.<ref name="anotherphase"/><ref>{{Citation | title = Tales from the Dark Side | url = http://www.soundandvisionmag.com/features/445/tales-from-the-dark-side.html | last = Richardson | first = Ken | publisher = soundandvisionmag.com | date = 2003-06 | accessdate = 2009-03-19}}</ref>  Guthrie has worked with the band since co-producing and engineering their 1979 release, ''[[The Wall]]'', and had previously worked on surround versions of ''The Wall'' for DVD-video, and Waters<U+2019>s ''In the Flesh'' for SACD.  Speaking in 2003, Alan Parsons expressed some disappointment with Guthrie's SACD mix:

{{Quote|I<U+2019>m generally rather disappointed. It<U+2019>s not very discrete.  There is some discrete information in there.  But I found myself, about two-thirds of the way through, kind of forgetting that this was surround.  James was possibly a little too true to the original mix.  He could have taken some risks, as I did on the quad.  One of the parameters I always work with when I<U+2019>m mixing for surround is: Keep the Interest.  If there<U+2019>s nothing going on, then stick something in the back.|Alan Parsons|<ref name="anotherphase"/>}}
<!-- need more about guthrie's mix here to avoid [[wp:npov]] -->

Speaking of the surround sound mix for "On the Run", Parsons said: "After hearing his mix for a while, I think I<U+2019>m hearing stereo with a bit of surround."  He went on to praise the mix for other songs, particularly for "The Great Gig in the Sky"<U+2014>"I tip my hat to James for sorting out the correct bits of Clare<U+2019>s vocals. And he has improved on the stereo mix, which is a bit wishy-washy. The stereo is heavy on the Hammond organ, and Clare's a little too far down. In my quad mix, the Hammond is barely there, which shows you I really wasn<U+2019>t being faithful to the stereo mix. The quad sounds pretty good, but James still has the edge. His mix is definitely cleaner, and he's brought Clare out a bit more."<ref name="anotherphasep2">{{Citation | title = Another Phase of the Moon page 2 | url = http://www.soundandvisionmag.com/features/444/another-phase-of-the-moon-page2.html | last = Richardson | first = Ken | publisher = soundandvisionmag.com | date = 2003-05 | accessdate = 2009-03-19}}</ref>  This 30th-anniversary edition won four Surround Music Awards in 2003.<ref>{{Citation | title = Surround Music Awards 2003 | url = http://www.surroundpro.com/2003/surround2003/sma.shtml | publisher = surroundpro.com | date = 2003-12-11 | accessdate = 2009-03-19}}</ref>

''The Dark Side of the Moon'' was also re-released in 2003 on 180-gram virgin vinyl (mastered by Kevin Gray at AcousTech Mastering) and included slightly different versions of the original posters and stickers that came with the original vinyl release, along with a new 30th anniversary poster.<ref>{{Citation | title = Pink Floyd <U+2014> Dark Side of the Moon <U+2014> 180 Gram Vinyl LP | url = http://store.acousticsounds.com/browse_detail.cfm?Title_ID=11084 | publisher = store.acousticsounds.com | accessdate = 2009-03-29}}</ref>

==''Dark Side of the Rainbow''==
{{main|Dark Side of the Rainbow}}
The ''Dark Side of the Rainbow'', or ''The Dark Side of Oz'', refers to rumours circulated on the internet since at least 1994, that the ''Dark Side of the Moon'' was written as a soundtrack to the 1939 film ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]''. Observers playing the film and the album simultaneously have reported many apparent synchronicities, such as [[Dorothy Gale|Dorothy]] beginning to jog as the band sings ""no one told you when to run".<ref>{{Harvnb|Reising|2005|p=57.}}</ref>

David Gilmour and Nick Mason have both denied any connection between the two works, and Roger Waters has described the rumours as "amusing".<ref>{{Harvnb|Reising|2005|p=59.}}</ref>  Alan Parsons has stated that the film was not mentioned during production of the album.<ref>{{Harvnb|Reising|2005|p=70.}}</ref>

==Singles==
In some countries, notably the UK, Pink Floyd had not released a single since 1968's "[[Point Me at the Sky]]". "Money" was released in the USA on 12&nbsp;May 1973, with "[[Any Colour You Like]]" on the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]].<ref>Harvest / Capitol 3609</ref>  Copies sent to radio stations had the word "bullshit" removed from the song, leaving "bull" in its place.  An uncensored promo version was also sent out and subsequently withdrawn; the censored replacement was sent to radio stations with a "frantic" note advising disc jockeys to dispose of the first copy.<ref>{{Citation | title = Goldmine Price Guide to 45 RPM Records | last = Neely | first = Tim | edition = 2 | year = 1999}}</ref>  The single eventually reached #13 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart.<ref>{{Harvnb|Harris|2006|pp=161&ndash;162.}}</ref>  "Time" was released on 4 February 1974, with "Us and Them" on the B-side<ref>Harvest / Capitol 45373</ref>
