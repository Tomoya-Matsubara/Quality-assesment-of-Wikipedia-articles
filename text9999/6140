'''Titanium''' is a [[chemical element]] in the [[periodic table]] that has the symbol '''Ti''' and [[atomic number]] 22. It is a light, strong, lustrous, [[corrosion]]-resistant (including resistance to [[sea water]] and [[chlorine]]) [[transition metal]] with a white-silvery-metallic [[colour]]. Titanium is used in strong light-weight [[alloy]]s (most notably with [[iron]] and [[aluminium]]) and its most common compound, [[titanium dioxide]], is used in white pigments. Examples in which white pigment, consisting of titanium oxide, is used, are [[correction fluid]] and commonly used white paint to repaint walls. It is also used in toothpaste, white road marking paints and in white fireworks. Substances containing titanium  are called titaniferous.

The element occurs in numerous minerals with the main sources being [[rutile]] and [[ilmenite]], which are widely distributed over the [[Earth]]. There are two [[allotropy|allotropic]] forms and five naturally occurring [[isotope]]s of this element; <sup>46</sup>Ti through <sup>50</sup>Ti with <sup>48<sup>Ti being the most [[natural abundance|abundant]] (73.8%). One of titanium's most notable characteristics is that it is as strong as [[steel]] but is only 60% its density. Titanium's properties are chemically and physically similar to [[zirconium]].

== Notable characteristics ==
Titanium is well known for its excellent resistance to [[corrosion]]; it is almost as resistant as [[platinum]], being able to withstand attack by [[acid]]s, moist [[chlorine]] gas, and by common [[salt]] solutions. Pure titanium is not [[solubility|soluble]] in water but is soluble in concentrated acids. A [[metal|metallic]] [[chemical element|element]], it is also well-known for its high strength-to-weight ratio. It is a light, strong metal with low [[density]] that, when pure, is quite [[ductility|ductile]] (especially in an [[oxygen]]-free environment), easy to work, lustrous, and metallic-white in [[colour]]. The relatively high [[melting point]] of this element makes it useful as a [[refractory metal]]. Commercially pure grades of titanium have an ultimate tensile strength equal to that of intermediate strength high strength low alloy steels, but are 43% lighter; it is 60% heavier than [[aluminium]], but more than twice as strong as 6061-T6 aluminium alloy; these numbers can vary quite substantially due to different alloy compositions and processing variables. They are included as guidelines only. 

This metal forms a [[passivation|passive]] and protective [[oxide]] coating (leading to corrosion-resistance) when exposed to elevated temperatures in air but at room temperatures it resists [[tarnish|tarnishing]].  The metal, which burns when heated in air 610&nbsp;<U+00B0>C or higher (forming titanium dioxide) is also one of the few elements that burns in pure [[nitrogen]] gas (it burns at 800&nbsp;<U+00B0>C and forms [[titanium nitride]]).<!-- many sources incorrectly say this is the *only* element to burn in nitrogen --> Titanium is resistant to dilute [[sulfuric acid|sulfuric]] and [[hydrochloric acid]], along with [[chlorine]] gas, [[chloride]] solutions, and most [[organic acid]]s. It is [[paramagnetic]] (weakly attracted to [[magnet]]s) and has a very low [[electrical resistivity]] and [[thermal conductivity]].

Experiments have shown that natural titanium becomes very [[radioactive]] after it is bombarded with [[deuteron]]s, emitting mainly [[positron]]s and hard [[gamma ray]]s. The metal is a dimorphic [[allotropy|allotrope]] with the hexagonal alpha form changing into the cubic beta form very slowly at around 880&nbsp;[[Celsius|<U+00B0>C]]. When it is red hot the metal combines with oxygen, and when it reaches 550&nbsp;<U+00B0>C it combines with [[chlorine]]. It also reacts with the other [[halogen]]s and absorbs [[hydrogen]].

== Applications ==
[[Image:Ti covered watches.jpg|left|200px|thumb|watch with titanium cover]]
About 95% of titanium production is consumed in the form of [[titanium dioxide]] (Ti[[oxygen|O]]<sub>2</sub>), an intensely white permanent [[pigment]] with good covering power in [[paint]]s, [[paper]], [[toothpaste]], and [[plastics]]. Paints made with titanium dioxide are excellent reflectors of [[infrared radiation]] and are therefore used extensively by [[astronomer]]s and in exterior paints. It is also used in [[cement]], in [[gemstone]]s, and as a strengthening filler in [[paper]]. Recently, it has been put to use in air purifiers (as a filter coating) or in window film on buildings which when exposed to [[UV light]] (either solar or man-made) and moisture content in the air converts unfiltered air pollution into [[hydroxyl|hydroxyl radicals]]. 

Because of its high [[tensile strength]] (even at high temperatures), light weight, extraordinary corrosion resistance, and ability to withstand extreme temperatures, titanium [[alloy]]s are used in [[aircraft]], [[armour plating]], [[navy|naval]] ships, [[spacecraft]] and [[missile]]s. It is used in [[steel]] alloys to reduce grain size and as a deoxidizer, and in [[stainless steel]] to reduce [[carbon]] content. Titanium is often alloyed with [[aluminium]] (to refine grain size), [[vanadium]], [[copper]] (to harden), [[iron]], [[manganese]], [[molybdenum]] and with other metals.

Welded titanium pipe is used in the chemical industry for its corrosion resistance and is seeing growing use in petroleum drilling, especially offshore, for its strength, light weight and corrosion resistance.

Titanium alloyed with vanadium is used in the outer skin of aircraft, fire walls, [[landing gear]], and hydraulic tubing. An estimated 58 tons of the metal is used in the [[Boeing 777]], 43 in the [[Boeing 747|747]], 18 in the [[Boeing 737|737]], 24 in the [[Airbus A340]], 17 in the [[A330]] and 12 in the [[Airbus A320#A320 |A320]], according to the 2004 annual report of the [[Titanium Metals Corporation]].  Generally, newer models use more and widebodies use the most. The  [[Airbus A380|A380]] may use 77 tonnes, including about 10 or 11 tons in the engines.

Use of titanium in consumer products such as [[tennis]] [[racquet]]s, [[golf club (equipment)|golf clubs]], [[bicycle]]s, [[laboratory equipment]], [[wedding band]]s, and [[laptop computer]]s is becoming more common.  

Other uses:
*Due to excellent resistance to [[sea water]], it is used to make propeller shafts and rigging and in the [[heat exchanger]]s of [[desalination plant]]s and in heater-chillers for salt water [[aquarium]]s, and lately diver knives as well.
*Owing to its strength and inertness to seawater, as well as its substantial ore deposits in Russia, it was the principal material used in the construction of many advanced Russian submarines, including deepest-diving military [[submarine]]s to date, [[Alfa class submarine|Alfa]] and [[Mike class submarine|Mike]] class, as well as [[Typhoon class submarine|Typhoon class]].
*It is used to produce relatively soft artificial [[gemstone]]s.
*[[Titanium tetrachloride]] (Ti[[chlorine|Cl]]<sub>4</sub>), a colourless liquid, is used to [[iridescence|iridize]] [[glass]] and because it fumes strongly in moist air it is also used to make [[smoke screen]]s and in [[skywriting]].
*In addition to being a very important pigment, titanium dioxide is also used in [[sunscreen]]s due to its resistance to UV.
*Because it is considered to be physiologically inert, the metal is used in [[joint replacement]] implants such as hip ball and sockets and to make medical equipment and in pipe/tank lining in [[food processing]].  Since titanium is non-ferromagnetic, patients with titanium implants can be safely examined with [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (convenient for long-term implants).
*Titanium is also used for the [[surgical instruments]] used in [[image-guided surgery]].
*Its inertness and ability to be attractively coloured makes it a popular metal for use in [[body piercing]].
*Titanium has the unusual ability to [[osseointegration|osseointegrate]], enabling use in [[dental implants]].  This ability is also exploited by some orthopaedic implants.  Orthopaedic applications also take advantage of titainium's lower modulus of elasticity to more closely match the modulus of the bone that such devices are intended to repair.  As a result, skeletal loads are more evenly shared between bone and implant leading to a lower incidence of bone degredation from stress shielding and periprosthetic bone fractures which occur at the boundaries of orthopaedic implants which act as stress risers. However, titanium alloys' stiffness is still more than twice that of bone, eventually leading to joint degradation.
*Titanium alloys are also used in [[glasses|spectacle]] frames. This results in a rather expensive, but highly durable and long lasting frame.  Both traditional alloys and [[shape memory alloy]]s find use in this application.
*Many [[backpacking|backpackers]] use titanium equipment, including cookware, eating utensils, lanterns and tent stakes. Though slightly more expensive than traditional steel or aluminium alternatives, these titanium products can be significantly lighter without compromising strength. Some would argue, however, that the thermal properties of titanium cookware make it unsuitable for serious culinary applications.
*Titanium is increasingly used in [[lacrosse]] stick shafts.
*Titanium is increasingly being used in cricket helmet grills.
*Titanium may be [[Anodising|anodised]] to produce various colours.[http://www.horie.co.jp/english.htm][http://www.cascadiadesignstudio.com/ring-colors.htm]

Titanium has occasionally been used in construction: the 150-foot (45 m) memorial to [[Yuri Gagarin]], the first man to travel in space, in [[Moscow]], is made of titanium for the metal's attractive colour and association with rocketry. The [[Guggenheim Museum Bilbao]] and the [[Cerritos#Cerritos Millennium Library|Cerritos Library]] were the first buildings in Europe and North America, respectively, to be sheathed in titanium panels.

== History ==
Titanium was [[discovery of the chemical elements|discovered]] at Creed, Cornwall in [[England]] by amateur geologist [[William Gregor|Reverend William Gregor]] in 1791. He recognized the presence of a new element in [[ilmenite]], and named it ''menachite'' (alternately spelled ''manaccanite''), after the nearby [[parish]] of [[Manaccan]] [http://www.westword.com/issues/2002-04-11/feature_full.html]. At around the same time, [[Franz Joseph Muller]] also produced a similar substance, but could not identify it. The element was independently rediscovered several years later by [[Germany|German]] chemist [[Martin Heinrich Klaproth]] in [[rutile]] ore. Klaproth confirmed it as a new element and in 1795 he named it for the [[titan (mythology)|Titans]] of [[Greek mythology]].

The metal has always been difficult to extract from its various ores. Pure metallic titanium (99.9%) was first prepared in 1910 by [[Matthew A. Hunter]] by heating Ti[[chlorine|Cl]]<sub>4</sub> with [[sodium]] in a steel bomb at 700&ndash;800&nbsp;<U+00B0>C in the [[Hunter process]]. Titanium metal was not used outside the laboratory until 1946 when [[William Justin Kroll]] proved that titanium could be commercially produced by reducing [[titanium tetrachloride]] with [[magnesium]] in the [[Kroll process]] which is the method still used today.

In [[1950s|1950]]&ndash;[[1960s|1960]]s the [[Soviet Union]] attempted to corner the world titanium market as a tactic in the [[Cold War]] to prevent the American military from utilizing it.{{Fact}} In spite of these efforts, the U.S. obtained large quantities of titanium when a European company set up a front for the U.S. foreign intelligence agencies to purchase it.{{Fact}}  Indeed, titanium for the highly successful U.S. [[SR-71]] [[reconnaissance aircraft]] was acquired from the Soviet Union at the height of the Cold War.

== Occurrence ==
Titanium metal is always bonded to other elements in nature. It is the ninth-most abundant element in the [[Earth]]'s crust (0.63% by [[mass]]) and is present in most [[igneous rock]]s and in [[sedimentary rock|sediments]] derived from them (as well as in living things and natural bodies of water). It is widely distributed and occurs primarily in the [[mineral]]s [[anatase]], [[brookite]], [[ilmenite]], [[perovskite]], [[rutile]], [[titanite]] (sphene), as well in many [[iron]] ores. Of these minerals, only ilmenite and rutile have significant economic importance, yet even they are difficult to find in high concentrations. Because it [[chemical reaction|reacts]] easily with [[oxygen]] and [[carbon]] at high temperatures, it is difficult to prepare pure titanium [[metal]], [[crystal]]s, or [[powder]]. Significant titanium ore deposits exist in [[Australia]], [[Scandinavia]], [[North America]], and [[Malaysia]]. Large quantities have also been detected in the Kwale region in Kenya, deposits to which a Canadian firm, Tiomin, has mining rights.

This metal is found in [[meteorite]]s and has been detected in the [[sun]] and in [[Stellar classification|M-type]] [[star]]s. [[Rock (geology)|Rock]]s brought back from the [[moon]] during the [[Apollo 17]] mission are composed of 12.1% TiO<sub>2</sub>. Titanium is also found in [[coal]] ash, [[plant]]s, and even the [[human]] body (while harmless, it is not believed to be an [[essential element]]).

[[Image:TitaniumUSGOV.jpg|thumb|Titanium (Mineral Concentrate)]]

== Isolation ==
Because the metal reacts with air at high temperatures it cannot be produced by reduction of its dioxide. Titanium metal is therefore produced commercially by the [[Kroll process]], a complex and expensive [[batch production|batch process]] developed in 1946 by [[William Justin Kroll]]. In the Kroll process, the oxide is first converted to chloride through [[carbochlorination]], whereby [[chlorine]] gas is passed over red-hot [[rutile]] or [[ilmenite]] in the presence of [[carbon]] to make [[Titanium tetrachloride|TiCl<sub>4</sub>]]. This is condensed and purified by [[fractional distillation]] and then [[reduction (chemistry)|reduced]] with 800&nbsp;<U+00B0>C molten [[magnesium]] in an [[argon]] atmosphere.

A newer process, the [[FFC Cambridge Process]], may replace the older Kroll process. This method uses the feedstock [[titanium dioxide]] powder (which is a refined form of [[rutile]]) to make the end product which is either a powder or sponge. If mixed oxide powders are used, the product is an alloy at a much lower cost than the conventional multi-step melting process. It is hoped that the [[FFC Cambridge Process]] will render titanium a less rare and expensive material for the [[aerospace]] industry and the luxury goods market, and will be seen in many products currently manufactured using [[aluminium]] and specialist grades of [[steel]].

Titanium was purified to ultra high purity in small quantities when [[Anton Eduard van Arkel]] and [[Jan Hendrik de Boer]] discovered the iodide, or [[Crystal bar process|crystal bar]], process in 1925, by reacting with iodine and decomposing the formed vapors over a hot filament to pure metal.

Titanium [[oxide]] is produced commercially by grinding its mineral ore and mixing it with [[potassium carbonate]] and aqueous [[hydrofluoric acid]]. This yields [[potassium fluorotitanate]] ([[potassium|K]]<sub>2</sub>Ti[[fluorine|F]]<sub>6</sub>) which is extracted with hot water and decomposed with [[ammonia]], producing an ammoniacal [[hydrate]]d oxide. This in turn is ignited in a [[platinum]] vessel, which creates pure titanium dioxide.

Common titanium [[alloy]]s are made by [[reduction (chemistry)|reduction]]. For example; cuprotitanium (rutile with [[copper]] added is reduced), ferrocarbon titanium (ilmenite reduced with [[coke (fuel)|coke]] in an electric furnace), and manganotitanium (rutile with manganese or manganese oxides) are reduced.

== Compounds ==
The +4 [[oxidation state]] dominates in titanium chemistry, but [[:Category:Titanium compounds|compounds]] in the +3 [[oxidation state]] are also common. Because of this high oxidation state, many titanium compounds have a high degree of [[covalent bond]]ing.

Although titanium metal is relatively uncommon, due to the cost of extraction, [[titanium dioxide]] (also called titanium(IV), titanium white, or even titania) is cheap, nontoxic, readily available in bulk, and very widely used as a white [[pigment]] in [[paint]], [[vitreous enamel|enamel]], [[lacquer]], [[plastic]] and construction [[cement]]. TiO<sub>2</sub> powder is chemically inert, resists fading in sunlight, and is very opaque: this allows it to impart a pure and brilliant white colour to the brown or gray chemicals that form the majority of household plastics. In nature, this compound is found in the [[mineral]]s [[anatase]], [[brookite]], and [[rutile]].

Paint made with titanium dioxide does well in severe temperatures, is somewhat self-cleaning, and stands up to marine environments. Pure titanium dioxide has a very high [[refractive index|index of refraction]] and an [[optical dispersion]] higher than [[diamond]]. [[Star sapphire (jewel)|Star sapphire]]s and [[ruby|rubies]] get their [[Asterism (gemmology)|asterism]] from the titanium dioxide present in them. [[Titanate]]s are compounds made with titanium dioxide. [[Barium titanate]] has [[piezoelectric]] properties, thus making it possible to use it as a transducer in the interconversion of [[sound]] and [[electricity]]. [[Ester]]s of  titanium are formed by the reaction of [[alcohol]]s and titanium tetrachloride and are used to waterproof [[Cloth|fabric]]s.

[[Titanium nitride]] is often used to coat cutting tools, such as [[drill bit]]s.  It also finds use as a gold-coloured decorative finish, and as a [[Copper-based chips#Barrier metal|barrier metal]] in [[semiconductor fabrication]].

[[Titanium tetrachloride|Titanium(IV) chloride]] (titanium tetrachloride, TiCl<sub>4</sub>, sometimes called "Tickle") is a colourless, weakly [[acid]]ic liquid which is used as an intermediate in the manufacture of titanium(IV) oxide for paint. It is widely used in [[organic chemistry]] as a [[Lewis acid]], for example in the [[Mukaiyama aldol]] condensation. Titanium also forms a lower chloride, [[titanium(III) chloride]] (TiCl<sub>3</sub>), which is used as a [[reducing agent]].

[[Titanocene dichloride]] is an important catalyst for carbon-carbon bond formation. [[Titanium isopropoxide]] is used for [[Sharpless epoxidation]]. Other compounds include; [[Titanium bromide]] (used in metallurgy, [[superalloy]]s, and high-temperature  electrical wiring and coatings) and [[titanium carbide]] (found in high-temperature cutting tools and coatings).

* See also [[:category:Titanium compounds|Titanium compounds]].

== Isotopes ==
Naturally occurring titanium is composed of 5 stable [[isotope]]s; <sup>46</sup>Ti, <sup>47</sup>Ti, <sup>48</sup>Ti, <sup>49</sup>Ti and <sup>50</sup>Ti with <sup>48</sup>Ti being the most abundant (73.8% [[natural abundance]]). Eleven [[radioisotope]]s have been characterized with the most stable being <sup>44</sup>Ti with a [[half-life]] of 63 years, <sup>45</sup>Ti with a half-life of 184.8 minutes, <sup>51</sup>Ti with a half-life of 5.76 minutes, and <sup>52</sup>Ti with a half-life of 1.7 minutes. All of the remaining [[radioactive]] isotopes have half-lifes that are less than 33 seconds and the majority of these have half-lifes that are less than half a second.

The isotopes of titanium range in [[atomic weight]] from 39.99 [[atomic mass unit|amu]] (<sup>40</sup>Ti) to 57.966 amu (<sup>58</sup>Ti). The primary [[decay mode]] before the most abundant stable isotope, <sup>48</sup>Ti, is [[electron capture]] and the primary mode after is [[beta emission]]. The primary [[decay product]]s before <sup>48</sup>Ti are element 21 ([[scandium]]) isotopes and the primary products after are element 23 ([[vanadium]]) isotopes.

== Precautions ==
As a powder or in the form of metal shavings, titanium metal poses a significant fire hazard and, when heated in [[air]], an explosion hazard. Water and [[carbon dioxide]]-based methods to extinguish fires are ineffective on burning titanium; [[fire classes#Class-D fires|Class D]] dry powder fire fighting agents must be used instead. 

[[Salt]]s of titanium are often considered to be relatively harmless but its chlorine compounds, such as TiCl<sub>2</sub>, TiCl<sub>3</sub> and TiCl<sub>4</sub>, have unusual hazards.  The dichloride takes the form of pyrophoric black crystals, and the tetrachloride is a volatile fuming liquid.  All of titanium's chlorides are [[corrosive]].  Titanium also has a tendency to [[bio-accumulate]] in tissues that contain [[silica]] but it does not play any known biological role in [[human]]s.
