The '''battle of Fredrikshamn''' was an attack by the Swedish archipelago fleet on their Russian counterparts near the town of Fredrikshamn during the [[Russo-Swedish War (1788<U+2013>1790)]]. The battle started in the early morning of May 15, 1790 when the Swedish fleet approached Fredrikshamn. The Russian fleet at Fredrikshamn hastily scrambled and sailed to face them and a several hour long firefight commenced with devastating result for the Russians. The battle cost the Russians 30 ships lost or captured including the archipelago frigate S<U+00E4>llan V<U+00E4>rre that for the second time entered Swedish service after it originally had been captured by the Russians in the [[First battle of Svensksund]]. 

After the battle the Swedish ships entered Fredrikshamn harbor and demanded the commander of the town fortifications to surrender along with the remainder of the Russian fleet. Any surprise initiative the Swedes had after the battle was lost when Gustav III allowed the Russian commander request of an hour of respite to value the demands of surrender. When the attack on the town resumed later that day the garrison was reinforced and ready. Any further Swedish attacks proved fruitless and in the evening of May 15 the Swedish fleet withdrew back to Svensksund.
