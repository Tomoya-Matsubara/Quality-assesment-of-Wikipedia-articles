'''''Ficus obliqua ''''', commonly known as the '''small-leaved fig''', is a tree in the family [[Moraceae]] native to eastern Australia, New Guinea, eastern Indonesia to [[Sulawesi]] and islands in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. Previously known for many years as '''''Ficus eugenioides''''', it is a [[banyan]] of the genus ''[[Ficus]]'', which contains around 750 species worldwide in warm climates, including the [[Common Fig|edible fig]] (''Ficus carica''). Beginning life as a seedling, which grows on other plants ([[epiphyte]]) or on rocks ([[lithophyte]]), ''F.&nbsp;obliqua'' can grow to 60&nbsp;m (200&nbsp;ft) high and nearly as wide with a pale grey [[buttress root|buttressed]] trunk, and glossy green leaves. 

The small round yellow fruit ripen and turn red at any time of year, although they peak in autumn and winter (April to July). Known as a [[syconium]], the fruit is an inverted [[inflorescence]] with the flowers aligning an internal cavity. ''Ficus&nbsp;obliqua'' is pollinated by two species of [[fig wasp]] - ''[[Pleistodontes greenwoodi]]'' and ''[[Pleistodontes xanthocephalus|P.&nbsp;xanthocephalus]]''. Many species of bird, including pigeons, parrots and various [[passerine]]s, eat the fruit. The range is along the east coast from [[Queensland]], through [[New South Wales]] in [[rainforest]], [[savanna]] woodland, [[sclerophyll forest]] and [[gallery forest]]. It is used as a shade tree in parks and public spaces, and is well-suited for use as an [[Houseplant|indoor plant]] or in [[bonsai]]. All parts of the tree have been used in traditional medicine in Fiji.

==Taxonomy==
Commonly known as the small-leaved fig, ''Ficus obliqua'' was [[Species description|described]] by German naturalist [[Georg Forster]] in 1786 based on [[type (biology)|type]] material collected in Vanuatu. Dutch botanist [[Friedrich Anton Wilhelm Miquel|Friedrich Miquel]] described ''Urostigma eugenioides'' from [[Albany Island]] in Queensland in 1861, which was reclassified by [[Victoria (Australia)|Victorian]] Government Botanist [[Ferdinand von Mueller]] as ''Ficus eugenioides'' in 1867, and it was known as this for many years. However, as Forster's name is older, it takes precedence. The specific epithet is the [[Latin]] adjective ''obliquus'', meaning "oblique", although the attribute it refers to is unclear.<ref name="Floyd09">{{cite book|last=Floyd|first=Alex G.|title=Rainforest Trees of Mainland Southeastern Australia|publisher=Terania Rainforest Publishing|location=Lismore, New South Wales|year=2009|page=232|isbn=978-0-9589436-7-3}}</ref> [[Frederick Manson Bailey]] described ''Ficus tryonii'' in 1906, from a collection at altitude on Middle Percy Island in the [[Whitsunday Islands]] off central Queensland, which is now regarded as ''F. obliqua''.

Female and male flowers in each syconium mature at different times. Female wasps enter the syconium and lay eggs in the female flowers as they mature. These eggs later hatch and the progeny mate. The females of the new generation collect pollen from the male flowers, which have matured by this point, and leave to visit other syconia and repeat the process. A field study in [[Brisbane]] found that ''F. obliqua'' trees often bore both male and female syconia at the same time<U+2014>this could be beneficial for reproduction in isolated populations, such as those on islands. The same study found a slightly reduced number of male phase syconia in winter, thought due to increased mortality of the wasp pollinator in cooler months.<ref name=mcpherson05/>

The animals that eat the figs disperse the seeds, which then germinate and grow on other plants ([[epiphyte]]s) or on rocks ([[lithophyte]]s). As the new plants develop, they send roots to the forest floor. Figs growing on other plants grow larger and larger until they [[strangler fig|strangle]] their hosts. ''Ficus obliqua'' is long-lived, and trees are thought to live in excess of 500 years.<ref name=Benson1997/><!-- cites previous three sentences -->

''Ficus obliqua'' is an elegant shade tree for parks or fields, and is adaptable to differing soils.<ref name=EJ15/> A notable specimen in Mick Ryan Park, [[Milton, New South Wales|Milton]] on the New South Wales south coast stands 14&nbsp;m (46&nbsp;ft) tall and 38&nbsp;m (124&nbsp;ft) across,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalregisterofbigtrees.com.au/listing_view.php?listing_id=276|title=Fig <U+2013> Small-leaved: Tree Details|last=Ciampa|first=Bernadette |year=2009|work=National Register of Big Trees: Australia's Champion Trees|publisher= National Register of Big Trees|accessdate=19 March 2012}}</ref> and is a local landmark.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ulladullatimes.com.au/news/local/news/general/artists-gather-under-the-fig-celebration-of-special-trees/317611.aspx|title=Artists gather under the fig- Celebration of special trees|date=18 November 2004|work=Milton Ulladulla Times|publisher=Fairfax Media|accessdate=19 March 2012}}</ref>  Like other fig species that grow into large trees, ''Ficus obliqua'' is not suitable for any but the largest gardens as its aggressive root system invades drains and garden beds. Fig trees also drop large quantities of fruit and leaves, leaving a mess underfoot.<ref name=EJ15/> Although it is much less used in [[bonsai]] than ''F. rubiginosa'',<ref>{{cite book |title=Rainforest to Bonsai |last=Webber |first=Len |year=1991 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |location=East Roseville, New South Wales |isbn=0-7318-0237-3 |page=109}}</ref> ''F. obliqua'' is well-suited for use in the medium; its small leaves and trunk's propensity to thicken give it attributes optimal for a tree 10<U+2013>80&nbsp;cm (4<U+2013>32&nbsp;in) in height. It is seen in bonsai nurseries mainly in the [[Brisbane]] area, where it is a locally common species, and is very highly regarded by at least one proponent, Bradley Barlow.<ref>{{cite book |title=Bonsai with Australian Native Plants |author=Koreshoff, Dorothy; Koreshoff, Vita |year=1984 |publisher=Boolarong Publications |location=Brisbane, Queensland |isbn=0-908175-66-3 |page=52}}</ref><ref name="Hnat10">{{cite journal | last = Barlow| first = Bradley | year = 2006 | title = Growing the  Queensland Small leaf Fig as Bonsai in South-east Queensland | journal = [[Association of Societies for Growing Australian Plants|ASGAP]] Australian Plants As Bonsai Study Group Newsletter | issue = 10 | pages = 5<U+2013>8|quote=The Queensland Small-leaf Fig&nbsp;... should be the first choice for more serious ''Ficus'' bonsai enthusiasts}}</ref><!-- both refs cite previous three sentences --> Barlow entered a specimen from Brisbane to the Bonsai Clubs International competition in 2006, winning a prize.<ref name="Hnat11">{{cite journal | last = Hnatiuk | first = Roger | year = 2006 | title = International Honours to Australians with Aussie Species as Bonsai | journal = [[Association of Societies for Growing Australian Plants|ASGAP]] Australian Plants As Bonsai Study Group Newsletter | issue = 11 | page = 1}}</ref> It is also suited for use as an [[Houseplant|indoor plant]] in low-, medium- or brightly lit indoor spaces.<ref>{{cite book|title=Fancy a Feast?

Known as ''baka'' or ''baka ni viti'' in [[Fiji]], ''Ficus obliqua'' has many of its parts used in Fijian traditional medicine,<ref name="cambie94"/> and was previously held to be sacred there.<ref>{{cite book|last=Blench|first=Roger |title=Archaeology and Language IV: Language Change and Cultural Transformation|publisher=Routledge|location=London, United Kingdom|year=1999|volume=35|pages=203|isbn=0-415-11786-0|url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=217jl_IBFP0C&pg=PA203&lpg=PA203&dq=%22Ficus+obliqua%22+fiji#v=onepage&q=%22Ficus%20obliqua%22%20fiji&f=false}}</ref> Its white sap has been used for painful or swollen joints and limbs or boils, or diluted with water and drunk to improve breast milk. Liquid extracted from the root bark has been used for headaches or, when diluted, to improve health after childbirth, and the leaves are applied to [[Sexually transmitted disease|venereal]] [[lesion]]s. The species has been traditionally used for [[boil]]s in Samoa and Tonga.<ref name="cambie94"/><!-- cites para -->
