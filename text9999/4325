'''Margaret Walker''' ('''Margaret Abigail Walker Alexander''' by marriage) (July 7, 1915&ndash; November 30, 1998) was an American [[poet]] and writer. She was part of the [[African-American]] literary movement in [[Chicago]]. Her notable works include the award-winning poem ''For My People'' (1942) and the novel ''[[Jubilee (novel)|Jubilee]]'' (1966), set in the South during the American Civil War.

==Biography==
Walker was born in [[Birmingham, Alabama]], to Sigismund C. Walker, a [[Methodism|Methodist minister]], and Marion (n<U+00E9>e Dozier) Walker, who helped their daughter by teaching her [[philosophy]] and poetry as a child. Her family moved to [[New Orleans]] when Walker was a young girl. She attended school there, including several years of college, before she moved north to [[Chicago]]. 

In 1935, Walker received her Bachelor of Arts Degree from [[Northwestern University]]. In 1936 she began work with the [[Federal Writers' Project]] under the [[Works Progress Administration]] of the President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] administration during the [[Great Depression]]. She was a member of the [[South Side Writers Group]], which included authors such as [[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]], [[Arna Bontemps]], [[Fenton Johnson (poet)|Fenton Johnson]], [[Theodore Ward]], and [[Frank Marshall Davis]].<ref>Knupfer, Anne Meis (2006). ''The Chicago Black Renaissance and Women's Activism''. Champaign, IL: University of Illinois Press.</ref> 

In 1942, she received her master's degree in creative writing from the [[University of Iowa]]. In 1965, she returned to that school to earn her [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D]].<ref name=Ibiblio/>

Walker married Firnist Alexander in 1943 and moved to [[Mississippi]] to be with him. They had four children together and lived in the capital of [[Jackson, Mississippi]]. 

==Academic career==
Walker became a literature professor at what is today [[Jackson State University]], a historically black college, where she taught from 1949 to 1979. In 1968, Walker founded the Institute for the Study of History, Life, and Culture of Black People (now the Margaret Walker Center). In 1976, she went on to serve as the Institute's director.<ref name=Ibiblio/>

==Literary writing==
In 1942, Walker's poetry collection ''[[For My People]]'' won the [[Yale Series of Younger Poets Competition]] under the judgeship of editor [[Stephen Vincent Benet]].<ref>Bradley, George. "Introduction", ''The Yale Younger Poets Anthology,'' New Haven and London: [[Yale University Press]], p. 24.</ref> Her ''For My People'' was considered the <U+201C>most important collection of poetry written by a participant in the [[Black Chicago Renaissance]] before [[Gwendolyn Brooks]]<U+2019>s ''A Street in Bronzeville''.<U+201D><ref>Darlene Clark Hine, William C. Hine and Stanley C. Harrold, ''The African-American Odyssey'', Upper Saddle, NJ: [[Prentice Hall]], 2011, p. 522. ISBN 0-205-72883-9.</ref> Richard Barksdale says: <U+201C>The [title] poem was written when "world-wide pain, sorrow, and affliction were tangibly evident, and few could isolate the Black man's dilemma from humanity's dilemma during the depression years or during the war years." He said that the power of resilience presented in the poem is a hope Walker holds out not only to black people, but to all people, to "all the Adams and Eves.<U+201D><ref>{{cite book|last=Barksdale|first=Richard K.|title=Modern Black Poets: A Collection of Critical Essays|year=1973|publisher=Prentice Hall}}</ref>

Walker<U+2019>s second novel, ''[[Jubilee (novel)|Jubilee]]'' (1966), is the story of a [[Slavery in the United States|slave]] family during and after the [[Civil War]], and is based on her great-grandmother's life.<ref name=UpennObit/> It took her thirty years to write. Roger Whitlow says. "It serves especially well as a response to white 'nostalgia' fiction about the antebellum and Reconstruction South."<ref>{{cite book|last=Whitlow|first=Roger|title=Black American Literature: A Critical History|year=1974|publisher=[[Rowman & Littlefield Publishers]]|isbn=978-0822602781}}</ref>

This book is considered notable in African-American literature and Walker is an influential figure for younger authors. She was the first of a generation of women who started publishing more novels in the 1970s.

In 1975, Walker released three albums of poetry on [[Folkways Records]] - ''Margaret Walker Alexander Reads Poems of [[Paul Laurence Dunbar]] and [[James Weldon Johnson]] and [[Langston Hughes]]''; ''Margaret Walker Reads Margaret Walker and Langston Hughes''; and ''The Poetry of Margaret Walker''.<ref>[http://www.folkways.si.edu/the-poetry-of-margaret-walker/african-american-spoken/album/smithsonian "The Poetry of Margaret Walker" (FW09795 / FL 9795), Smithsonian Folkways.]</ref><ref>[http://www.folkways.si.edu/margaret-walker-alexander-reads-langston-hughes-pl-dunbar-jw-johnson/african-american-spoken-poetry/album/smithsonian "Margaret Walker Alexander Reads Langston Hughes, P.L.

==Court cases==
In 1988, Margaret Walker sued [[Alex Haley]], claiming that his novel ''[[Roots: The Saga of an American Family]]'' had violated ''Jubilee''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s copyright by borrowing from her novel. The case was dismissed.

In 1991 Walker was sued by Ellen Wright, the widow of [[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]], on the grounds that Walker's use of unpublished letters and an unpublished journal in a just-published biography of Wright violated the widow's copyright. ''[[Wright v. Warner Books]]'' was dismissed by the district court, and this judgment was supported by the appeals court.<ref>{{cite web |ref=harv |url=http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/953/731/222890/
