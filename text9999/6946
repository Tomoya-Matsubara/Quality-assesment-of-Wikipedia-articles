Jack goes on to become the central character in ''Torchwood'', an adult-themed spin-off of ''Doctor Who''.

Jack first appeared in the two-parter episodes "[[The Empty Child]]" and "[[The Doctor Dances]]" of the 2005 series of ''Doctor Who''. The Doctor's ([[Christopher Eccleston]]) companion [[Rose Tyler|Rose]] ([[Billie Piper]]) meets him during the [[London Blitz]] in 1941, where he is posing as an American volunteer in the [[Royal Air Force]], with the rank of Group Captain. Jack is revealed to be a con man who is unwittingly responsible for releasing a plague, but redeems himself by saving everyone from a German bomb.<ref name=EmptyChild/><ref name=DoctorDances/>  Afterwards, he accompanies the Doctor for several adventures in his time machine, the [[TARDIS]],<ref name=BoomTown>{{cite episode|title=[[Boom Town (Doctor Who)|Boom Town]]|series=Doctor Who|credits=Russell T Davies, Joe Ahearne, Phil Collinson|network=BBC|airdate=2005-06-04}}</ref><ref name=BadWolf>{{cite episode|title=[[Bad Wolf]]|series=Doctor Who|credits=[[Russell T Davies]], [[Joe Ahearne]], [[Phil Collinson]]|network=[[BBC]]|airdate=2005-06-04}}</ref><ref name=Parting>{{cite episode|title=[[The Parting of the Ways]]|series=Doctor Who|credits=Russell T Davies, Joe Ahearne, Phil Collinson|network=BBC|city=Cardiff|airdate=2005-06-18}}</ref> and the character transforms from the con man he was into a hero.<ref name=ello/> In his final 2005 appearance in "The Parting of the Ways", set on the futuristic [[space station]] [[Satellite 5]], Jack is killed opposing the [[Dalek]]s; Rose brings him back to life while suffused with the power of the [[time vortex (Doctor Who)|time vortex]].<ref name=Parting/>  He is then left behind by the Doctor and Rose, who depart Satellite 5 in the TARDIS.

The character returned in 2006 as the star of spin-off series, titled ''Torchwood'', now leading the [[Cardiff]]-based organisation [[Torchwood Institute#Torchwood Three, Cardiff|Torchwood]] dedicated to protecting Britain from alien threats.

John Barrowman himself was a key factor in the conception of Captain Jack.

===Character development===
The character's unexpected popularity with all audiences,<ref name=ello/><ref name=NYTimes/><ref name=ExaminerInterview/> would later shape his appearances both as a traditional "[[action hero]]" and as a positive role model for younger viewers.<ref name=Gardner>{{cite web|last=Elliott|first=Sean|title=Exclusive interview: 'Doctor Who' & 'Torchwood' series producer Julie Gardner teases next seasons of each show|work=iF Magazine|publisher=Electric Entertainment|date=2007-07-30|url=http://www.ifmagazine.com/feature.asp?article=2267|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-07-30}}</ref>
Expanding upon his action hero role, the character would develop some supernatural abilities in ''Torchwood'', primary among them a seemingly absolute immortality (with alternate mechanisms of resurrection and invulnerability),<ref name=Utopia/> and also the ability to heal others<ref name=DayOne/><ref name=Cyberwoman/> as well as limited [[telepathy]].<ref name=Greeks/> Russell T Davies referred to a scene in "Last of the Time Lords" as promoting a theory that Jack may one day become recurring character "[[Face of Boe|the Face of Boe]]" (a large, mysterious disembodied head in a jar) as a consequence of his immortality and slow aging.<ref>{{cite web|title="Last of the Time Lords" Podcast|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediaselector/check/doctorwho/ram/313_commentary?size=au&bgc=CC0000&nbram=1&bbram=1&nbwm=1&bbwm=1|date=[[2007-07-27]]|accessdate=2007-06-30}}</ref> The Face first appeared in 2005 episode "[[The End of the World (Doctor Who)|The End of the World]]", appearing fully three times and maintaining a presence through to the end of the 2007 series.

==Critical reception and impact==
Following the character's initial introduction in the revived series 1 of ''Doctor Who'', the character became incredibly popular with fans,<ref name="ello">{{cite video|people=Russell T Davies, David Tennant, John Barrowman, Freema Aygeman, [[Anthony Head]]|year=2007|date=June 26|title=Doctor Who Confidential, "'Ello, 'Ello, 'Ello"}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=Marcus|last=Casey|title=Captain Jack's a real gas|url=http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,23739,21971088-5003422,00.html|publisher=couriermail.com.au|date=2007-07-27|accessdate=2007-06-27}}</ref><ref name=NYTimes>{{cite news|first=Dave|last=Itzkoff|authorlink=Dave Itzkoff|title=Sexed-Up British Intelligence|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F6091EF63D550C768CDDAA0894DE404482|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|date=2006-05-25|accessdate=2007-06-27|quote=...Jack proved so popular, he was granted his own spin-off series, ''Torchwood''...|format=Fee required}}</ref> to the extent that Russell T Davies and [[Julie Gardner]] created a spin-off series, ''Torchwood'', primarily centred around the character.<ref name=AfterElton /> ''[[The Times]]'' described the undeniable success of the character as having propelled actor John Barrowman to "National Treasure status".<ref name=TheTimes>{{cite news|first=Cailtlin|last=Moran|authorlink=Caitlin Moran|title=Captain Jack's back!|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article1926461.ece|work=Times Online|publisher=''[[The Times]]''|date=2007-06-16|accessdate=2007-06-27}}</ref> Part of Jack's mystique was his sex appeal, swashbuckling heroism and sexual appetite.<ref name=AfterElton2>{{cite web|url=http://www.afterelton.com/archive/elton/TV/2006/10/torchwood.html|title=''Torchwood'': Captain Jack Gets His Own Show|accessdate=2007-06-27|date=[[2006-10-24]]}}</ref> In anticipation of the character's return to ''Doctor Who'' in series 3 after a successful run in the first series of ''Torchwood'', mainstream media hailed his return.<ref name=TheTimes/> 

{{Quotation|''I do watch a lot of television science fiction, and it is a particularly sexless world. With a lot of the material from America, I think gay, lesbian and bisexual characters are massively underrepresented, especially in science fiction, and I'm just not prepared to put up with that. It's a very macho, testosterone-driven genre on the whole, very much written by straight men. I think Torchwood possibly has television's first bisexual male hero, with a very fluid sexuality for the rest of the cast as well. We're a beacon in the darkness.''<br>&mdash;Russell T Davies<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/tv--radio/parallel-universe/2007/06/13/1181414307840.html|title=Parallel universe|accessdate=2007-06-27|publisher=theage.com.au}}</ref>}} 
In the media, Jack is described as both the "first openly gay companion" and as a "hunky bisexual".<ref>{{cite news|first=Ian|last=Burrell|authorlink=Ian Burrell|title=BBC to screen 'Dr Who for adults' as new spin-off show|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/media/article320110.ece|publisher=''[[The Independent]]''|date=2005-08-16|accessdate=2007-06-27}}</ref> Jack's notability is largely due to his mainstream representation of a bisexual man in science fiction television, for whom [[sexual identity]] is "matter-of-fact",<ref name=AfterElton2/> and not an issue.<ref name=WestEnd/> The ordinariness with which Jack's orientation is regarded within ''Doctor Who'' embodies part of a political statement about changing societal views of [[homosexuality]].<ref name=MansMan/> The distinct flexibility of Jack's sexuality contributed directly towards the character's popularity and public interest.<ref name=MansMan/> The overtness of Jack's sexuality broke new grounds, the labels "pansexual" and "omnisexual" being applied to the character on occasion. In "The Parting of the Ways", Jack kissed both Rose and the Doctor on the lips,<ref name=Parting/> the latter being the first same-sex kiss in the history of the programme. Despite the boldness of the first [[LGBT|LGB]] character in the series' run, there has been very little uproar about the character, athough there was some controversy at the time of Jack's introduction.<ref>{{cite news|title=Doctor Who scenes cut for being 'too horrible'|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/entertainment/film_and_tv/s/159/159082_dr_who_scenes_cut_for_being_too_horrible.html|publisher=''[[Manchester Evening News]]''|date=2005-08-15|accessdate=2007-06-27}}</ref>

Jack has gone on to become a recognisable figure in the British public consciousness, and therefore has attracted some parody.  The character of Jack Harkness has been parodied several times on the satirical [[impressionist (entertainment)|impressionist]] television show ''[[Dead Ringers (comedy)|Dead Ringers]]''. Played by [[Jon Culshaw]], the show pokes fun at his bisexuality and apparent [[camp (style)|campiness]], as well his melodramatic personality in ''Torchwood''. In one sketch, he walks bizarrely towards the camera, kissing a policeman as he passes him.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Season 7, Episode 1|series=[[Dead Ringers (comedy)|Dead Ringers]]|credits=[[Jon Plowman]], [[Jon Culshaw]], [[Jan Ravens]], [[Phil Cornwell]], [[Kevin Connelly]], [[Mark Perry]]|network=BBC|airdate=2007-02-27}}</ref> In another sketch, he can be seen having a threesome with two [[Cyberman|Cybermen]],<ref>{{cite episode|title= Season 7, Episode 6|series=Dead Ringers|credits=Jon Plowman, Jon Culshaw, Jan Ravens, Phil Cornwell, Kevin Connelly, Mark Perry|network=BBC|airdate=2007-03-29}}</ref> classic ''Doctor Who'' villains dating back to 1966.<ref name=TenthPlanet>{{cite serial|title=[[The Tenth Planet]]|series=Doctor Who|credits=[[Kit Pedler]], [[Derek Martinus]]|network=BBC|airdate=1966-10-08}}</ref> The character's popularity with young children has led to the creation of a Captain Jack action figure.
