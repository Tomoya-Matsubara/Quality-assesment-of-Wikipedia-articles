The '''Horse Protection Act of 1970''' ('''HPA'''); (codified {{usc|15|1821|1831}}){{efn|Full details: {{USStatute|91|540|84|1404|1970|12|09}}, amended {{USStatute|94|360|90|915|1976|07|13}}, codified {{usc|15|1821|1831}}}} is a United States [[federal law]], under which the practice of [[soring]] is a crime punishable by both [[Civil law (common law)|civil]] and [[Criminal law|criminal]] penalties, including fines and jail time. It is illegal to show a horse or enter it at a horse show, to auction, sell, offer for sale, or transport a horse for any of these purposes if it has been sored.

Soring is the practice of applying irritants or blistering agents to the front feet or forelegs of a horse, making it pick its feet up higher in an exaggerated manner that creates the movement or "action" desired in the [[horse show|show ring]]. Soring is an act of [[animal cruelty]] that gives practitioners an unfair advantage over other competitors. The Horse Protection Act is enforced by the [[Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service]] (APHIS), a branch of the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA). Although violations of the law are seen most often in the [[Tennessee Walking Horse]] industry, the Horse Protection Act covers all breeds.

Originally all inspectors were from APHIS, but a lack of funding led to a 1976 amendment to the Act, which allows non-USDA employees to be trained and certified as inspectors. This program has not always been successful, with some non-USDA inspectors being more lenient on violators than others, and citations for violations tend to increase significantly when USDA inspectors are present at a show. Several methods are used to detect violations of the Act, including observation, palpation and [[gas chromatography]]/[[mass spectrometry]] to identify chemicals on horses' legs. Certain training techniques and topical anesthetics can be used to avoid detection by the first two methods. There have been a number of unsuccessful challenges to the Act on the grounds on constitutionality, as well as challenges on varying other issues. In 2013, an amendment to the Act was proposed in the [[United States House of Representatives]]. The amendment would allow only USDA employees to perform inspections, toughen penalties for violations, and outlaw the use of action devices and "stacks", or layers of pads attached to the bottom of the front hooves.

Soring began in the 1950s with [[gaited horse]]{{efn|A [[gaited horse]] is one that performs a smooth, four-beat intermediate speed [[ambling]] gait.<ref name=Equus2>{{cite journal|title=Breeds that Gait|journal=Equus|year=2007|issue=August|pages=52<U+2013>54}}</ref>}} trainers who were looking to improve their chances of winning at [[horse show]]s. To do this, they developed methods to enhance the desired high action [[horse gait|gaits]] to levels greater than that produced by traditional training methods. Thus began the use of irritants, including chemicals and physical objects, or abusive shoeing and hoof-trimming practices on the front legs. Attempting to relieve the pain in its legs, a sored horse lifts its front feet off the ground more quickly, creating a flashier gait. By the 1960s, soring had gained popularity, as horses so treated gained an edge in competition.<ref name=APHIS/> However, public opposition to the practice also grew, and in 1966, the American Horse Protection Association was created in part to address the issue of soring. In 1969, Senator [[Joseph Tydings]] sponsored legislation to prohibit soring, leading to the passing of the Horse Protection Act in 1970,<ref name="Equus"/> amended in 1976. While [[Tennessee Walking Horse]]s, [[Racking horse|Racking Horse]]s and other "high-stepping breeds"<ref name=APHIS/> are generally targeted by these abusive practices, the Horse Protection Act covers all breeds.<ref name=APHIS>{{cite web|url=http://www.aphis.usda.gov/publications/animal_welfare/content/printable_version/FS-HorseProtectionAct-Final.pdf|format=PDF|title=The Horse Protection Act|work=Animal Care|publisher=Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service|accessdate=March 15, 2013}}</ref>

Soring is defined by the HPA with four meanings:

<blockquote>(3)(A) an irritating or blistering agent has been applied, internally or externally, by a person to any limb of a horse, <br>(B) any burn, cut, or laceration has been inflicted by a person on any limb of a horse, <br>(C) any tack, nail, screw, or chemical agent has been injected by a person into or used by a person on any limb of a horse, or <br>(D) any other substance or device has been used by a person on any limb of a horse or a person has engaged in a practice involving a horse, and, as a result of such application, infliction, injection, use, or practice, such horse suffers, or can reasonably be expected to suffer, physical pain or distress, inflammation, or lameness when walking.<ref>{{usc|15|1821}}</ref></blockquote>

==Contents==

The Horse Protection Act is found in [[Title 15 of the United States Code|Title 15]] of the [[United States Code]], which covers commerce and trade. Section (<U+00A7>) 1821 covers the definitions of the terms used in the Act and <U+00A7>1822 details the Congressional statement of findings. The requirements placed upon horse shows and exhibitions are covered in <U+00A7>1823. <U+00A7>1824 covers the core provisions of the Act,<ref name=Cornell/> prohibiting the "shipping, transporting, moving, delivering, or receiving of any horse which is sore"<ref>{{usc|15|1824}}</ref> as well as the actual showing, exhibition, entry into a show, sale, or auction of a sored horse, including offering a sored horse for sale, as well as outlining the responsibilities of show management and recordkeeping requirements. The export of horses is covered in <U+00A7>1824a. <U+00A7>1825 covers penalties for violations detailed previously in the Act, which may be civil or criminal, with fines of up to $50,000 and imprisonment of up to five years. <U+00A7>1826 details the required notice of violations to the [[Attorney General of the United States]]. The utilization of USDA and state government staff is covered in <U+00A7>1827, as is non-financial assistance to states. Rules and regulations pertaining to the Act's statutes are covered in <U+00A7>1828. <U+00A7>1829 covers [[federal preemption]] of state laws, [[concurrent jurisdiction]], and prohibitions on certain state actions. <U+00A7>1830 is currently reserved for future use, and <U+00A7>1831 details the authorization of appropriations for expenses related to the enforcement of the provisions of the Act.<ref name=Cornell>{{cite web|url=http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/chapter-44|title=15 USC Chapter 44 <U+2013> Protection of Horses|publisher=Cornell University Law School|accessdate=March 15, 2013}}</ref>

==Implementation==

As originally enacted, the Horse Protection Act was to be enforced by [[Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service]] (APHIS), a branch of the USDA.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://crs.ncseonline.org/NLE/CRSreports/05jun/97-905.pdf|format=PDF|page=139|author=Womach, Jasper|title=Agriculture: A Glossary of Terms, Programs, and Laws, 2005 Edition|date=June 16, 2005|accessdate=March 15, 2013|publisher=Congressional Research Service}}</ref> However, a lack of staff and funding meant little success, leading to the 1976 amendment to the Act. With this amendment, Congress created a Designated Qualified Person (DQP) program. This program allows non-USDA employees from within the equine community to take training and certification programs run by Horse Industry Organizations (HIOs) and supervised by the USDA; after completing the training, they may complete inspections for violations of the HPA at public events. The USDA is then able to double check the work of DQP participants by making random inspections at a small number of shows. One member of the Tennessee Walking Horse world states that this creates "the potential for a "fox guarding the chicken coop" situation",<ref name=Day/> as if the HIO is not fully interested in preventing or detecting the practice of soring, the DQPs may not be fully trained or may deliberately overlook instances of soring.<ref name=Day>{{cite journal|url=http://www.thehorse.com/articles/14560/the-horse-protection-act|title=The Horse Protection Act|journal=The Horse|author=Day, Martha M.|date=April 1, 2004|accessdate=March 16, 2013}}</ref> When APHIS inspectors are present at horse shows, the number of citations for violations increases significantly.<ref name=Patton/> Competitors and trainers at shows, viewing themselves as unjustly persecuted,<ref name=Patton2/> have been known to leave when they find APHIS inspectors present, rather than allowing the inspectors to see their horses.<ref name=Patton>{{cite journal|url=http://www.kentucky.com/2008/08/08/483277/walking-horse-reforms-urged.html#|title=Walking Horse Reforms Urged|journal=Lexington Herald-Leader|date=August 8, 2008|accessdate=March 16, 2013|author=Patton, Janet}}</ref><ref name=Patton2>{{cite journal|url=http://www.kentucky.com/2008/09/13/522136/usda-inspectors-dampen-walking.html#|title=USDA Inspectors Dampen Walking Horse Show|date=September 13, 2008|accessdate=March 16, 2013|author=Patton, Janet|journal=Lexington Herald-Leader}}</ref> In June 2012, the USDA published a new rule requiring violations found by HIOs to have penalties assessed at a rate equal to or exceeding those given by APHIS inspectors. Previously, HIOs were allowed to set their own penalty rates, resulting in some organizations acting leniently towards violators of the HPA.<ref name=FinalRule>{{cite web|url=http://www.aphis.usda.gov/newsroom/2012/06/hpa_finalrule.shtml|author=Press Release|publisher=APHIS|title=USDA Publishes Final Rule to Provide Greater Protection for Horses|date=June 5, 2012|accessdate=March 16, 2013}}</ref>

For the first decades following passage of the Act, foreign substances applied to the legs, including chemicals, were detected by feel, sight or smell.<ref name=USDAPressrelease>{{cite journal|url=http://www.thehorse.com/articles/16158/usda-announces-method-for-enforcing-the-horse-protection-act|title=USDA Announces Method for Enforcing the Horse Protection Act|author=Press Release|journal=The Horse|date=April 17, 2006|accessdate=March 16, 2013}}</ref>  Since 2006, the USDA has used [[gas chromatography]]/[[mass spectrometry]] to identify chemicals found on horses' legs at events. Samples of suspicious substances are swabbed at the show, and sent to a laboratory for analysis; owners and trainers are later informed of the results.  However, this method is only used by APHIS veterinary medical officers at present.<ref name=USDAPressrelease/>

Soring can be also detected by observing the horse for [[Lameness (equine)|lameness]], assessing its stance and palpating the lower legs. Some trainers evaded detection from inspectors by training horses not to react to the pain that palpation may cause, often by severely punishing the horse for flinching after the sored area is touched. The practice is called "stewarding," in reference to the [[horse show steward]].<!--commented out until sourced:   Trainers may also time the application of soring agents so that chemicals will not be detected when the horse is examined, but the horse will feel their effects by the time the horse and rider enter the show ring.--> Others use topical anesthetics, such as [[lidocaine]] and [[benzocaine]], which are timed to wear off before the horse goes into the show ring. Use of chemicals can be completely avoided if pressure shoeing is also used.<ref name="Equus">{{cite journal|url=http://equisearch.com/horses_care/health/lameness/soring_030706/ |title=EQUUS Special Report: Why Soring Persists |publisher=EQUUS |accessdate=March 17, 2013|author=Meszoly, Joanne|date=November 2005}}</ref> This process involves placing some type of hard foreign object (such as a small piece of wood, stone, hard acrylic, or sharp object such as a tack or nail) against the sole of the horse's foot before applying the horseshoe and pads.  It can also be done by trimming down the horse's hoof to its sensitive structures, then shoeing. Either method causes pain when the horse places its foot on the ground.<ref name=Lessiter>{{cite web|last=Lessiter|first=Frank|title=Soring: Disgraceful Practice Continues|url=http://www.americanfarriers.com/pages/Features-Soring-(Part-1)-Disgraceful-Practice-Continues.php|work=American Farrier's Journal|publisher=Lessiter Publications|accessdate=June 24, 2013}}</ref>

==Impact==
[[File:RunningWalk.jpg|thumb|right|A Tennessee Walking Horse, one of the breeds most affected by the Act]]

There have been a number of challenges to the Horse Protection Act on the grounds of constitutionality, mainly regarding [[due process]] and [[equal protection]], none of which were successful.  Courts have also ruled on other issues with regard to the Act, including whether knowledge of soring or intent to sore is required in order to prove a violation of the act, and courts have repeatedly held that it is not.<ref>Case, pp. 673<U+2013>675</ref> The issue of digital palpation, one of the main methods used by inspectors to find and verify soreness, has been contested in several courts, and is the only issue that has had courts come to varying conclusions on its legitimacy. The majority of courts with appeals rising to the [[United States courts of appeals|Circuit Court]] level, have held that palpation is a legitimate method for identifying soreness, and that soreness found through palpation is grounds for penalties under the Horse Protection Act. However, in a decision promulgated by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit|Fifth Circuit Court]], it was found that soreness found through digital palpation alone was not sufficient evidence upon which to base penalties.<ref>Case, pp. 675<U+2013>677</ref>

The largest association in the United States for [[equine veterinarian]]s, the [[American Association of Equine Practitioners]] (AAEP), called the practice of soring "one of the most significant welfare issues affecting any equine breed or discipline" after releasing a [[white paper]] on the subject in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.aaep.org/press_room.php?id=312|title=AAEP Issues White Paper on Ending the Soring of Tennessee Walking Horses|date=August 7, 2008|accessdate=June 3, 2013|publisher=American Association of Equine Practitioners}}</ref> The organization pointed out that despite over three decades of work, the HPA law had failed to prevent sored horses from being trained, shown, and sold. The AAEP blamed this failure on what they called the "woefully inadequate"<ref name=Patton/> level of funding for enforcement, which the law caps at $500,000 annually.<ref name=Patton/> The federal [[Office of Inspector General]] found in 2010 that the self-enforcement system of HIOs and DQPs was inadequate for eliminating the practice of soring. This led to the June 2012 strengthening of penalty systems.<ref name=FinalRule/>

===Proposed amendments===

Since the 1976 amendment, there have been several other proposed changes to the Act, all unsuccessful so far. In 2005, HR 503, titled the "Horse Slaughter Prohibition Bill," was introduced by U.S. Representative [[John E. Sweeney]] (R-NY). The bill would have made major changes to the focus of the Horse Protection Act, by prohibiting the "shipping, transporting, moving, delivering, receiving, possessing, purchasing, selling, or donation of horses and other equines to be slaughtered for human consumption." It passed the House of Representatives in 2006, but died in the Senate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/109/hr503|title=H.R. 503 (109th): Horse Slaughter Prohibition bill|publisher=GovTrack|accessdate=June 2, 2013}}</ref>

In September 2012, U.S. Representatives [[Ed Whitfield]], a [[republican party of the United States|Republican]] from Kentucky, and [[Steve Cohen]], a [[Democratic party of the United States|Democrat]] from Tennessee, proposed HR 6388, titled the "Horse Protection Act Amendments of 2012." That bill died in committee.
