'''Hurricane Dean''' was the strongest [[tropical cyclone]] of the [[2007 Atlantic hurricane season]]. It was the most intense [[Atlantic hurricane]] since [[Hurricane Wilma]] of [[2005 Atlantic hurricane season|2005]], tying for seventh overall. Additionally, it made the third most intense Atlantic hurricane landfall. A [[Cape Verde-type hurricane]], Dean took a west-northwest path from the eastern [[Atlantic Ocean]] through the [[Saint Lucia Channel]] and into the [[Caribbean Sea]]. It strengthened into a major hurricane, reaching Category&nbsp;5 status on the [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale]] before passing just south of [[Jamaica]] on August 20. The storm made landfall on the [[Yucat<U+00E1>n Peninsula]] on August&nbsp;21 as a powerful Category&nbsp;5 storm. It crossed the peninsula and emerged into the [[Bay of Campeche]] weakened, but still a hurricane. It strengthened briefly before making a second landfall in [[Veracruz]] near [[Tecolutla]], [[Mexico]], on August 22. Dean drifted to the northwest, weakening into a remnant [[Low pressure area|low]] which dissipated uneventfully over the southwestern United States.

The hurricane's intense winds, waves, rains and storm surge were responsible for at least 45&nbsp;deaths across ten countries and caused estimated damages of [[United States dollar|US]]$1.5&nbsp;billion.<ref name="TCR"/><ref name="INJ_2007-08-20_Lucia01"/> First impacting the islands of the [[Lesser Antilles]], Dean's path through the Caribbean devastated agricultural crops, particularly those of [[Martinique]] and [[Jamaica]]. Upon reaching Mexico, Hurricane Dean was a Category&nbsp;5 storm, but it missed major population centers and its exceptional Category&nbsp;5 strength landfall caused no deaths and less damage than in the Caribbean islands it passed as a Category&nbsp;2 storm.

Through the affected regions, cleanup and repair took months to complete. Donations solicited by international aid organizations joined national funds in clearing roads, rebuilding houses, and replanting destroyed crops. In Jamaica, where the damage was worst, [[banana]] production did not return to pre-storm levels for over a year. Mexico's tourist industry, too, took almost a year to rebuild its damaged [[cruise ship]] infrastructure.

Dean was the first hurricane to make landfall in the Atlantic basin at Category&nbsp;5 intensity in 15&nbsp;years; the last storm to do so was [[Hurricane Andrew]] on August 24, 1992.<ref name="td4disc33">{{cite web|author=Pasch/Brown|date=2007-08-21|title=Hurricane Dean Discussion Thirty Three|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2007-08-20|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2007/al04/al042007.discus.033.shtml?}}</ref>  Dean's Category&nbsp;5 landfall was in a sparsely populated area and thus far less damaging than Andrew's, but its long swath of damage earned its name retirement from the [[World Meteorological Organization|World Meteorological Organization's]] [[Lists of tropical cyclone names#North Atlantic|Atlantic hurricane naming lists]].

==Preparations==
Hurricane Dean's smooth and well-predicted track gave unusually advanced warning to all of the nations in its path and allowed them time to prepare for the storm's impact.<ref name="TCR"/> Because of the advanced warning and because of Dean's extraordinary strength, the nations of Central America and the Caribbean set up hundreds of shelters, readied thousands of disaster recovery experts, evacuated hundreds of thousands of vulnerable residents, and prepared millions of dollars of emergency supplies.

Fifteen countries felt the effects of Hurricane Dean as its path through the Caribbean Sea claimed 42&nbsp;lives. The hurricane first brushed the Lesser Antilles on August 17, 2007, and as it passed through the interior of the Caribbean its outer rain bands swept over the Greater Antilles. It passed Jamaica as a Category&nbsp;4 hurricane, and strengthened to a Category&nbsp;5 storm as it made landfall on Mexico's Yucat<U+00E1>n Peninsula on August 21. A second landfall on August 22 was less devastating.

[[Image:Freedom of the seas.jpg|thumb|This [[Royal Caribbean International|Royal Caribbean]] ship, [[MS Freedom of the Seas|''Freedom of the Seas'']], was the first [[cruise ship]] to visit Jamaica after Hurricane Dean. It called into [[Ocho Rios]] on August 22]]
Despite Dean's significant damage, it did not have severe effects on infrastructure, and the non-agricultural sectors of most affected nations recovered quickly. Most cruise lines diverted their ships away from the Western Caribbean in anticipation of Hurricane Dean's passage, though by August 27 all were back on schedule, except those with damaged ports in Belize and the Yucatan. The Lesser Antilles and the Greater Antilles were especially quick to resume servicing cruise lines, as their ports opened within days.<ref name="Fodors">{{cite web|url=http://www.fodors.com/news/story_2690.html|title=Hurricane Dean: Don't Cancel Your Trip|accessdate=2008-06-27|date=2007-08-29|publisher=Fordor's}}</ref>

The French Overseas Minister, Christian Estrozy and French Prime Minister, Francois Fillon visited French Caribbean island to assess the storm's damage. They estimated the storm left 600&nbsp;people homeless. The brevity of their visit prompted some of Martinique's famous writers, including [[Edouard Glissant]], [[Patrick Chamoiseau]] and [[Raphael Confiant]], to write an open letter airing their grievances concerning French politics and the handling of Hurricane Dean's impact.<ref name="caribnews_guad_aug_23">{{cite web|url = http://www.caribbeannetnews.com/guadeloupe/guadeloupe.php?news_id=3166&start=0&category_id=33|title = Guadeloupe and Martinique after Dean

By the end of the summer on 2008, banana production in Jamaica was returning to pre-Dean levels.
