The '''AE86''' generation of the '''Toyota Corolla Levin''' and '''Toyota Sprinter Trueno''' is a small, lightweight [[coupe]] introduced by [[Toyota]] in 1983 as part of the fifth generation [[Toyota Corolla]] lineup. For the purpose of brevity, the insider-chassis code of "AE86" depicts the 1600&nbsp;cc RWD model from the range. In classic Toyota code, the "A" represents the engine that came in the car (4A series), "E" represents the Corolla, "8" represents the fifth generation ([[Toyota Corolla (E80)|E80 series]]) and "6" represents the variation within this generation.

The Levin has fixed-headlights, and the Trueno has retractable headlights, both could be hatchback or coupe. The export model name Corolla covers both variations. The AE86 (along with the lower spec {{convert|1452|cc|L}} [[Toyota AE85|AE85]] and 1587&nbsp;cc SR5 versions) was [[rear wheel drive]] (unlike the [[front wheel drive]] CE80, EE80 and AE82 models), and is among the last rear-drive cars of its type, at a time when most passenger cars were being switched to front-drive. In 1987, there was a limited edition model of the AE86 called "Black Limited" that served as a send-off model before the AE86 chassis was replaced later that year by the front wheel drive AE92 Corolla/Sprinter range.

In Japan, the AE86 was also known as the {{Nihongo|Hachi-Roku|<U+30CF><U+30C1><U+30ED><U+30AF>}}, [[Japanese language|Japanese]] for "eight-six". In Japan, the Sprinter Trueno was exclusive to Toyota Japan dealerships called ''[[Toyota#Japan|Toyota Vista Store]],'' while the Corolla Levin was exclusive to ''Toyota Corolla Store''. The word "trueno" is [[Spanish (language)|Spanish]] for thunder, and "levin" is [[Old English]] for "lightning".

The AE86 later inspired the [[Toyota 86]] (also badged as the Scion FR-S and Subaru BRZ.)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://arabia.msn.com/autos/news/ame/2012/may/15820730/toyota-sports-car-heritage-predecessors.aspx |title=Toyota Sports Car Heritage {{!}} Toyota 86 Predecessors |work=Arabia MSN Autos |accessdate=2012-06-12}}</ref>

==Engine/technical==
The AE86 was available with a fuel-injected [[Inline-four engine|4-cylinder]] [[twin-cam]] 1587&nbsp;cc [[Toyota A engine|4A-GE engine]] in Japan and Europe which was also used in the first-generation [[Toyota MR2]] (AW11). This engine had a maximum gross power output of {{convert|130|PS|kW|abbr=on}} and {{convert|110|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}} of [[torque]] in standard form, though it was later down-rated to {{convert|120|PS|kW|abbr=on}} and {{convert|105|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}} in net output.<ref name=driftjapan>[http://driftjapan.com/blog/toyota/toyota-corolla-ae86 Drift Japan <U+00BB> Toyota Corolla AE86] - AE86 History and Overview</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://autozine.org/classic/toyota.htm#MR2 |title=Classic Cars Page |publisher=Autozine.org |date= |accessdate=2010-10-18}}</ref> The AE86 came with a 5-speed manual [[gearbox]], and later came with the option of an automatic. The 4A-GE engines used in the AE86 and AW11 were equipped with [[T-VIS]] (Toyota Variable Intake System). The AE86 had an optional [[limited slip differential|LSD]].<ref name=driftjapan />

In North America, a modified 4A-GEC engine was used to comply with California emissions regulations. Power was rated at 112&nbsp;bhp (84&nbsp;kW), and 96&nbsp;lb<U+00B7>ft (136&nbsp;Nm) of torque.<ref name=driftjapan />

The AE86 used ventilated [[disc brake]]s. The car was equipped with a MacPherson strut style [[independent suspension]] at the front and a four-link live axle with coil springs for the rear. Stabilizer bars were present at both ends.<ref name=driftjapan />

Lower-spec American AE86 SR5 models used the 1587&nbsp;cc 4A-C SOHC unit, did not have an optional LSD, and had rear drum brakes. Also, the SR5 model had a softer suspension, and small styling and interior changes.

Models equipped with the 4A-GE engine received a 6.7" rear differential, while 4A-U, and 4A-C models received a smaller, weaker, 6.38" rear differential.

The AE86 SR5 (4A-C equipped) had an optional [[automatic transmission]], though the GT-S model (with the 4A-GE DOHC engine) only came with a standard 5-speed [[manual gearbox]].

One of the staff who was behind the car's engineering work was [[Nobuaki Katayama]], who would later head the company's motorsport department and who would become chief engineer of the [[Lexus IS|Altezza]] project a decade later.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} An article in Car Magazine in April 1999, stated he has a photo of an AE86 hung in his office.

Both the Levin and Trueno variants were offered with either a 2-door coupe or 3-door [[liftback]] (sometimes called hatchback) [[body style]]. The Levin and Trueno were generally identical, apart from fixed, rectangular headlights on the Levin and pop-up headlights on the Trueno. Minor bodywork changes were made in 1986 which resulted in different tail lights for both Levin and Trueno models, along with the coupe and hatchback styles. The models sold between 1983<U+2013>1985 are sometimes referred to as "''zenki''" (<U+524D><U+671F>, lit. ''early period''), and the models sold from 1986<U+2013>1987 are referred to as "''kouki''" (<U+5F8C><U+671F>, lit. ''latter period'').<ref name=hr>[http://www.hachiroku.com.au/2008/04/ae86-specifications-history-trim-differences/ Hachiroku.com.au Blog - <U+306F><U+3061><U+308D><U+304F><U+30D6><U+30ED><U+30B0>] - AE86: An In-Depth Look at A Legend</ref> The coupe version is considered to be the more rigid and lighter version of the two.<ref name=driftjapan />

==Models/specifications==
In Japan, the DOHC 4A-GEU AE86 was offered in GT, GT-APEX and GTV [[trim package|trims]] as the Corolla Levin or Sprinter Trueno. In North America, the top-spec DOHC 4A-GEC was sold as the Corolla GT-S (with AE86 on the build plate in the engine bay but AE88 in the VIN), with the SOHC 4A-C being sold as the Corolla SR5 (with AE86 on the build plate and in the VIN). Both versions were sold with pop-up headlights only.  Euro spec models were sold as the Corolla GT with DOHC engines and fixed Levin-style headlights. The Middle East received the same basic model as the North American market, with pop-up headlights and the regulated 5&nbsp;mph (8&nbsp;km/h) [[bumper (automobile)|bumpers]].

The lightest AE86 is the Japanese 2 door GT model which weighs {{Convert|910|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}. It has the same exterior as the GTV trim, but with the interior of the AE85 with the exception of the gauges, and is equipped with rear drum brakes.

===North American AE86 specifications===

==The AE86 in motorsports==

[[File:Ae86 drift.jpg|thumb|Drifting AE86]]

During its production life, the AE86 was a popular choice for showroom stock, [[Group A]], and [[Group N]] racing, especially in [[rallying]] and circuit races. Even after production of the car was discontinued, many privateer teams still raced the AE86, and it is still a popular choice for rallying and club races today. Part of the continued appeal of the AE86 for motorsports is its rear-drive configuration, a feature not available in most newer lightweight coupes. In Group A world rally cars (1600&nbsp;cc class) the [[Toyota A engine#4A-GZE|4A-GZE]] engine was popular. In Group A [[touring car racing|touring car races]], the car either dominated the lower category where eligible or fought it out with [[Honda Civic]]s or the later [[Toyota Corolla (E90)|AE92s]] and [[Toyota Corolla (E100)|AE101s]] whilst maintaining its competitiveness. In Ireland, where rallying is considered one of the most popular forms of motorsport, as organizing regulations are more relaxed compared to that of other countries, the AE86 was popular when new, and is still so popular that teams will purchase cars from the UK due to local shortages. The AE86 is also popular for rally use in Finland, where the cars can be competitive in the F-Cup competition for naturally aspirated 2WD cars.

The semi-factory supported Kraft team entered a spaceframe Trueno at the [[JGTC]] with a [[Toyota 3S-GTE engine|3S-GTE]] engine that came from a [[Toyota MR-2#W20|SW20 MR-2 Turbo]] producing about {{Convert|300|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} for the [[JGTC#GT300|JGTC GT300]] regulations in 1998. Despite being popular with the racefans, the car had minor success and was abandoned from use halfway through the 2001 season in favor of a newly delivered [[Toyota MR-S|MR-S]].

The rear wheel drive configuration, combined with the AE86's light weight (approximately 2300&nbsp;lb (950<U+2013>970&nbsp;kg) curb weight), balance and relatively powerful (and easy to tune) [[Toyota 4A-GE|4A-GEU]] engine made it popular among the Japanese ''[[hashiriya]]'' (street racers in Japanese), many of whom raced in mountain passes (''[[touge]]'' in Japanese) where the corners suited the AE86 best, especially on the downhill.<ref name=driftjapan /> Among those who utilized this car was Japanese racing legend [[Keiichi Tsuchiya]] also known as the ''Dori-Kin'' ("Drift King" in Japanese). Keiichi Tsuchiya helped popularize the sport of [[drifting (motorsport)|drifting]], which involves taking a car on a set of controlled slides through corners.<ref name=driftjapan /> The AE86's FR configuration made it well suited to this kind of cornering, and currently the car is a mainstay of drift shows and competitions.

==In Popular Culture==
[[File:Ae086.jpg|thumb|right|Initial D AE86 replica in Melbourne, Australia]]

The main character of the anime and manga [[Initial D]], Takumi Fujiwara, uses his father's AE86 Trueno for racing and making his tofu deliveries. Also in Initial D, Itsuki Takeuchi drives an AE85 Levin, mistaken for an AE86 and Wataru Akiyama drives a supercharged AE86 Corolla Levin.  Later on in the series, Shinji Inui drives the Notchback coupe version of the AE86 Trueno.

The popularity of the manga is cited as the main cause of the car's high resale price.

The Corolla Levin, the Sprinter Trueno, and a modified AE86 similar to the one depicted in Initial D are featured in the racing video game series [[Gran Turismo (series)]].
