'''Francisco M<U+00E9>rida P<U+00E9>rez''' (born 4 March 1990 in [[Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]]) is a [[Spain|Spanish]] [[Association football|footballer]] who plays for [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] as a [[midfielder]].

==Career==
===Barcelona===
M<U+00E9>rida joined the youth ranks of [[FC Barcelona]] at the age of eight<ref name="uefa533576"/> but left the club in September 2005 and was reportedly hidden away by his agent, Joseba D<U+00ED>az leading to speculation that he would leave for England with no compensation for the Spanish club as was the case when [[Cesc F<U+00E0>bregas]] joined Arsenal from Barcelona. Fran Merida's parents had become uneasy about all the young players joining Barcelona and felt that youngster would have a better chance elsewhere. Therefore, they approached D<U+00ED>az, also [[Cesc F<U+00E0>bregas]]' agent, and he promptly alerted [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]], [[A.C. Milan|Milan]], and [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]. Barcelona's fears were realized when M<U+00E9>rida joined Arsenal without compensation, as he had not signed a contract with Barcelona.

====Contract controversy====
On 9 October 2007, M<U+00E9>rida was ordered by the courts to pay a fee around <U+20AC>3.2m to [[FC Barcelona]] as compensation for his "failing to meet the terms of a personal pre-contract" with Barcelona.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://msn.foxsports.com/soccer/story/7270520 | title= Barca wins lawsuit against Arsenal's Merida | work=Fox Sports| date=17 October 2005}}</ref> The decision was said to have serious implications for clubs in England, where players can sign professional contracts at 17, one year earlier than in Spain. In response, a Madrid-based lawyer, Rodrigo Garc<U+00ED>a, was quoted as saying, "English teams will now think again before signing a young Spanish player ... It's an important ruling."<ref>[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=/sport/2007/10/11/sfnbar111.xml Fran Merida hit for <U+00A3>2m by Barcelona]</ref> Arsenal footed the bill on M<U+00E9>rida's behalf, and David Dein, then vice-chairman, struck a diplomatic truce with Barcelona, promising to pay the compensation as well as promising to be more circumspect in their scouting of their youth team.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1224403/Payback-time-Arsenals-Fran-Merida-Carling-Cup-goal.html | title= Payback time for M<U+00E9>rida after Goal | work=Daily Mail| date=31 October 2009}}</ref>

===Arsenal===
He signed professional terms with Arsenal after his 17th birthday.<ref name="arsenal452971">{{cite news |title=Fran Merida signs professional terms|publisher=arsenal.com |date=8 March 2007|url=http://www.arsenal.com/article.asp?thisNav=reserves+and+youth&article=452971&lid=&Title=Fran+Merida+signs+professional+terms |accessdate=2 August 2007}}</ref> He scored on his first team debut for Arsenal in a friendly against [[Boreham Wood F.C.|Boreham Wood]] in August 2006.<ref name="arsenal408364">{{cite news |last=Harris |first=Chris |title=Banfield - We have high hopes for Merida |publisher=arsenal.com |date=7 August 2006|url=http://www.arsenal.com/article.asp?thisNav=reserves+and+youth&article=408364&lid=&Title=Banfield+-+We+have+high+hopes+for+Merida%20Banfield |accessdate=2 August 2007}}</ref> His competitive first-team debut came on 25 September 2007, when he came on as a 91st minute substitute in Arsenal's 2-0 victory over [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle]] in the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] third round,<ref>[http://www.skysports.com/football/match_facts/0,19762,11065_2889420,00.html Sky Sports - Match facts (Arsenal v.

On 3 April 2008, M<U+00E9>rida extended his deal with Arsenal by signing a long-term (unspecified) contract, securing his future with Arsenal. He is expected to play an important role in the future as manager [[Ars<U+00E8>ne Wenger]] described him as "an absolutely amazing player". He scored his first goal for the club against Liverpool in the Carling cup where Arsenal won 2-1.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11661_3380752,00.html|publisher=Sky Sports|title=Wenger delight at Merida deal}}</ref> 

====Loan to Real Sociedad====
On 27 December 2007, [[I<U+00F1>aki Badiola]], then-prospective presidential candidate of the [[Spain|Spanish]] club [[Real Sociedad]], claimed he agreed a loan deal with Arsenal for M<U+00E9>rida till the end of the ''[[Segunda Divisi<U+00F3>n]]'' [[Segunda Divisi<U+00F3>n 2007<U+2013>08|season]]. Badiola became Real Sociedad president on 4 January and Merida's loan to Real Sociedad was confirmed five days later.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.realsociedad.com/caste/home/real.asp?menu=110100&id=82366| title=M<U+00E9>rida: "Aportar<U+00E9> mi granito de arena para intentar ascender"|language=Spanish|work=RealSociedad.com}}</ref> He made 14 appearances during the loan, scoring once while being credited with six assists.

====Return to Arsenal====
For the 08/09 season M<U+00E9>rida returned to Arsenal, he made his first start for Arsenal in a 6<U+2013>0 win over Sheffield United in the League Cup on 23 September 2008. He started on the left wing for the League Cup home tie against [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] on November 2008 in which Arsenal won the game 3<U+2013>0, with Merida playing the whole match. On 2 March 2009, Arsene Wenger heaped praise on Fran, claiming the reason for him making the bench for the previous few first team games is because "He has been doing very, very well. He looks really good in training and is getting stronger all the time." M<U+00E9>rida made his [[Premier League]] debut, coming off the bench for [[Samir Nasri]] with just 8 minutes to go in the 3<U+2013>1 win at West Brom, hours before his 19th birthday. M<U+00E9>rida also finished the season by coming off the bench against Portsmouth.

====2009/10 Season====
Merida returned from the 2009 UEFA U19 European Championships for the 2009/10 season and was named as a substitute in the [[Emirates Cup]] 2009. He came off the bench for [[Aaron Ramsey]] in the 67th minute in Arsenal's first match against [[Atletico Madrid]] and he started and created a goal for [[Eduardo da Silva|Eduardo]] against [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]]. Arsenal then went on to win the match 3-0 and regain the [[Emirates Cup]]. He was then included in Arsenal's first team for the season and handed shirt number 46 and subsequently came on in the 70th minute against [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] in Arsenal's second Premier League match of the season.  He was then upgraded to shirt number 32, formerly worn by [[Theo Walcott]]. In a [[Carling Cup]] game against [[Liverpool F.C]], Merida scored a screamer from the edge of the area, hitting the post on its way past Liverpool F.C goalkeeper [[Diego Cavalieri]].<ref>{{cite web

[[Arsene Wenger]] then accused Atletico of tapping up M<U+00E9>rida after announcing their public interest of talking to the youngster, saying "I can't say I'm annoyed by other clubs going after our players because we do it as well. But we do it legally." "The difference is that we do not do what is not allowed by the law. We try to get the best players everywhere when it is allowed by the rules."<ref>{{cite web
