==History==
The Empire Hotel has long played a major role in Dunedin culture. Originally named ''The Queen's Arms'', it was built on its present site in 1858, only 10 years after the founding of Dunedin. At that time, before much of the harbourside land was [[land reclamation|reclaimed]], its site near the city's main wharf made it a central gathering place providing accommodation, food, and drink. When the [[Otago Gold Rush]] broke, three years later, it became the central building in a thriving entertainment district. The current brick building, designed by Thomas Bedford Cameron,<ref name="built">"[http://builtindunedin.com/tag/1880s/ Thomas Bedford Cameron, architect]", ''builtindunedin.com''. Retrieved 17 January 2015.</ref> replaced the original structure in 1879, and was renamed the Empire Hotel in 1898.<ref name="NZHPT"/>

The tavern became a pivotal venue for the development of Dunedin's distinctive music scene of the 1980s, known worldwide as the [[Dunedin Sound]]. Under the ownership of John and Maureen Simpson, the upstairs bar became a principal venue for performances by such bands as [[The Chills]], [[The Verlaines]], and [[The Clean]].<ref name="ODT">Rudd, A.

Retrieved 20 January 2015.</ref> Even now, several years after the closure of the venue, the Empire is still regarded by many as the home of the Dunedin Sound: <blockquote>"It is to this city what the [[Cavern Club]] is to Liverpool in terms of what it helped spawn, even if compared to the Beatles neither the bands who played in it, or the venue itself, is a household name<U+2026>it cannot be underestimated the role the Empire played in nurturing a local music scene that is acknowledged within alternative music circles around the world." (Dr. [[Graeme Downes]], founder of [[The Verlaines]]) <ref name="NZHPT"/></blockquote>

==The building==
The Empire Hotel is part of a historic precinct containing numerous [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] and [[Edwardian architecture|Edwardian]] buildings, several of which have NZHPT classification. Rising three storeys, it has a plain, plastered frontage with a metal fire escape. Two arched entrance doors stand at either end of the ground-level frontage. The hotel was originally built with more decoration on its fa<U+00E7>ade, but much of this was removed during the late 20th century.<ref name="built"/>
