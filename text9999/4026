'''''The Amazing Jeckel Brothers''''' is the fifth studio album by American [[hip hop music|hip hop]] [[Duet (music)|duo]] [[Insane Clown Posse]], released on May 25, 1999, by [[Island Records]], in association with [[Psychopathic Records]]. Recording sessions for the album took place from 1998 to 1999. The album is the fifth [[Dark Carnival (Insane Clown Posse)#Joker's Cards|Joker's Card]] in the group's [[Dark Carnival (Insane Clown Posse)|Dark Carnival]] mythology. The album's lyrics focus on the 19 circles of hell, and the morality of man as he is torn between righteousness and evil, describing the Jeckel Brothers as spirits who juggle pulsating blood-covered balls, representing the sins committed during the mortal life of the dead.

''The Amazing Jeckel Brothers'' was the second studio album Insane Clown Posse released by Island, and features a more [[hip hop music|hip hop]]-based sound, as opposed to the [[rock music|rock]]-oriented sound of its predecessor, ''[[The Great Milenko]]'' (1997). ''The Amazing Jeckel Brothers'' features guest appearances by popular rappers [[Ol' Dirty Bastard]] and [[Snoop Dogg]], and additional contributions by [[The Jerky Boys]] and [[Twiztid]]. Although the album was poorly received by critics, it debuted fourth on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' charts, and was later [[Music recording sales certification|certified platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA).

==Background==
After a tumultuous contract with [[Jive Records]] sub-label Battery in 1995, Insane Clown Posse (ICP) attempted to find a new record label. Manager Alex Abbiss negotiated a contract with the [[The Walt Disney Company|Walt Disney Company]]-owned label [[Hollywood Records]], which reportedly paid US$1&nbsp;million to purchase the Insane Clown Posse contract from Battery/Jive Records.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1430332/19970703/i_c_p.jhtml |title=Insane Clowns Point The Finger At Disney |accessdate=2008-05-04 |date=July 3, 1997 |publisher=[[MTV]]}}</ref>

After recording and releasing ''[[The Great Milenko]]'', Insane Clown Posse was notified that Hollywood Records had deleted the album within hours of its release,<ref name="BehindthePaint306"/> despite having sold 18,000 copies and reaching #63 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].<ref name="Browne">{{cite web |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,288784,00.html |title=Review of ''The Great Milenko'' |accessdate=2008-05-08 |last=Browne |first=David |date=July 25, 1997 |publisher=''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1430331/19970704/i_c_p.jhtml |title=Insane Clown Posse Angry At Disney's Decision |accessdate=2008-05-04 |date=July 4, 1997 |publisher=[[MTV]]}}</ref> It was later revealed that Disney was being criticized by the [[Southern Baptist Convention|Southern Baptist Church]].

In due time, labels such as [[Interscope Records]] wanted to sign the group,<ref name="Disney-controversy"/> but [[Island Records]]' [[Chris Blackwell]] came to the group's rescue and agreed to release ''The Great Milenko'' as it was originally intended.<ref name="BehindthePaint330">{{cite book |last=Bruce |first=Joseph |authorlink=Joseph Bruce |coauthors=Hobey Echlin |editor=Nathan Fostey |title=ICP: Behind the Paint |origdate=  |origmonth=August |edition=2nd |publisher=Psychopathic Records |location=Royal Oak, Michigan |isbn=09741846083 |pages=330<U+2013>335 |chapter=Disney's Hoe Tactics|year=2003 }}</ref> Thanks to the controversy, and additional promotion by Island, over one million copies of ''The Great Milenko'' had been sold by 1998,<ref name="BehindthePaint414">{{cite book |last=Bruce |first=Joseph |authorlink=Joseph Bruce |coauthors=Hobey Echlin |editor=Nathan Fostey |title=ICP: Behind the Paint |origdate= |origyear=2003 |origmonth=August |edition=2nd Edition |publisher=Psychopathic Records |location=Royal Oak, Michigan |isbn=09741846083 |pages=414<U+2013>433 |chapter=Big Money Hustlas }}</ref> and Insane Clown Posse was ready for the fifth Joker's Card, ''The Amazing Jeckel Brothers''.

==Recording and production==

Working with [[Mike E. Clark]] and Rich "Legs Diamond" Murrell, [[Joseph Bruce]] and [[Joseph Utsler]] developed their album with the highest of hopes. Hoping to receive the respect Bruce and Utsler felt they deserved, they planned to feature well-known, respected rappers on their album.<ref name="BehindthePaint414"/> Bruce stated outright that he wanted to involve [[Snoop Dogg]], [[Ol' Dirty Bastard]], and [[Ice-T]].<ref name="Rappers">{{Cite web | title = Insane Clown Posse Taps O.D.B., Snoop, Ice-T For New Album, Wave Goodbye to WWF

Snoop Dogg also helped them contact Ol' Dirty Bastard, who was paid $30,000 for his appearance. Ol' Dirty Bastard recorded his track in a matter of two days; however, his recording consisted of nothing more than him rambling about "bitches."<ref name="BehindthePaint414"/> It took Bruce and Utsler a week to assemble just four rhymes out of his rambling, and had to re-record the track and title it "Bitches."<ref name="BehindthePaint414"/> Finally, Insane Clown Posse contacted [[Ice-T]].<ref name="Rappers"/> However, he charged them only $10,000.<ref name="BehindthePaint414"/> The group felt that Ice-T's song did not belong on the album, and was instead released on the compilation, ''[[Psychopathics from Outer Space]]'' (2000).<ref name="BehindthePaint414"/> The song "Echo Side" was originally released at an Insane Clown Posse concert in [[Garden City, Michigan]] as the first ever single from [[Dark Lotus]].<ref name="BehindthePaint560">{{cite book |last=Bruce |first=Joseph |authorlink= |coauthors=Hobey Echlin |editor=Nathan Fostey |title=ICP: Behind the Paint |origdate= |origyear=2003 |origmonth=August |edition=2nd Edition |publisher=Psychopathic Records |location=Royal Oak, Michigan |isbn=09741846083 |pages=560<U+2013>561 |chapter=Complete Discography }}</ref>

To help increase their positive publicity, the group hired the [[Nasty Little Man]] publicity team.<ref name="BehindthePaint414"/> The team set up a photo shoot for Insane Clown Posse that was to appear on the cover of ''[[Alternative Press]]'' magazine in [[Cleveland]]. On the set of the photo shoot, a member of the publicity team approached Bruce and explained that in the song "Fuck the World", the lyric that stated "Fuck the [[Beastie Boys]] and the [[Dalai Lama]]" needed to be changed.<ref name="BehindthePaint414"/> Insulted, Bruce exclaimed that his music would not be censored again <U+2013> referring to [[Walt Disney Company|Disney's]] previous requirement of censure.<ref name="BehindthePaint414"/> Nasty Little Man told Bruce that the Beastie Boys were not only clients of the company but also personal friends, and the Beastie Boys told the company to make Bruce change the lyric.<ref name="BehindthePaint414"/> In response, Bruce fired Nasty Little Man and asked its team to leave the photo shoot.<ref name="BehindthePaint414"/>

While the album's predecessor, ''The Great Milenko'', was written and recorded in a more [[rock music|rock]]-oriented style, featuring contributions by guitarists [[Slash (musician)|Slash]] and [[Steve Jones (musician)|Steve Jones]], ''The Amazing Jeckel Brothers'' featured a more [[hip hop music|hip hop]]-oriented sound. [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] of [[Allmusic]] wrote, "Where ''The Great Milenko'' [...] was targeted at white-boy, adolescent metalheads [...]  ''The Amazing Jeckel Brothers'' contains cameos from Snoop Dogg and Ol' Dirty Bastard, plus a cover of a Geto Boys song, which brings [Insane Clown Posse] to street level."<ref name="Erlewine"/>

To produce the album, Insane Clown Posse once again teamed up with renowned Detroit [[record producer]] and [[disc jockey|DJ]] [[Mike E. Clark]], who utilized standard hip hop techniques such as [[record scratching]] and [[Sampling (music)|samples]] ranging from 1970s [[funk]] to [[Calliope (music)|calliope]] music and [[Beck]].<ref name="Maher">{{Cite web  | last = Maher   | first = Brendan  | title = Insane Clown Posse, The Amazing Jeckel Brothers  | publisher = PopMatters  | url = http://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/19728/insaneclownposse-amazing  |accessdate=10 May 2010}}</ref> ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' writer Barry Walters wrote that Clark's production incorporates elements of "carnival organ riffs, [[power chord]]s and shotgun blasts&nbsp;... banjolike plucking and [[Van Halen]]-esque guitar squeals."<ref name="RSJeckelBros">{{cite web |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/insaneclownposse/albums/album/120991/review/6068329/the_amazing_jeckel_brothers |title=Insane Clown Posse: The Amazing Jeckel Brothers: Music Reviews |accessdate=2007-12-26 |first=Barry |last=Walters |date=1999 |publisher=''[[Rolling Stone]]'' }}</ref>

A chaotic duo of juggling masters, Jack "the sinister" and Jake "the just" juggle the sins of mortal men... There is no escape from their juggling act because there is no way to escape ourselves.

During the two years between ''The Great Milenko'' and ''The Amazing Jeckel Brothers'', Insane Clown Posse had become nationally known, but were not taken very seriously.<ref name="BehindthePaint414"/> While the controversy over ''The Great Milenko'' allowed the duo to attract the attention of [[Island Records]], it also attracted Insane Clown Posse to public criticism for their style and lyrics.<ref name="BehindthePaint306">{{cite book |last=Bruce |first=Joseph |authorlink=Joseph Bruce |coauthors=Hobey Echlin |editor=Nathan Fostey |title=ICP: Behind the Paint |origdate= |origyear=2003 |origmonth=August |edition=2nd Edition |publisher=Psychopathic Records |location=Royal Oak, Michigan |isbn=09741846083 |pages=306<U+2013>314 |chapter=Banned by a Filthy Rat }}</ref> Bruce recalls the period as an angry era for the group due to all of the negativity directed toward them.<ref name="BehindthePaint414"/> He says that they "used to keep two piles of press at [their] office. One pile was all the positive press [they've] gotten, which was under an inch tall. Then [they] had the negative press pile, which was spilling over the side of a full basket."<ref name="BehindthePaint414"/> As a result, ''The Amazing Jeckel Brothers'' was recorded as a release for their anger.<ref name="BehindthePaint414"/>
