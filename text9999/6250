== History ==
[[Image:Coventry Cathedral NewOld.jpg|thumb|250px|Coventry Cathedral, showing the new building by Arup in the background.]]
[[Image:Sydney Opera House Sails.jpg|thumb|250px|Sydney Opera House]]
[[image:mill.bridge.from.tate.modern.arp.jpg|thumb|250px|The Millennium Bridge, London]]
The firm was founded in [[1946]], as Ove N. Arup, Consulting Engineers by [[Ove Arup|Sir Ove Nyquist Arup]]. Sir Ove set out to build a firm where professionals of diverse disciplines could work together to produce projects of greater quality than was achievable than by them working in isolation. The firm was later reformed as "Ove Arup & Partners" with partners Ronald Jenkins, Geoffrey Wood and Andrew Young.

In the late 1940s and 1950s the firm undertook work around the UK, including the [[Brynmawr Rubber Factory]] and [[Coventry Cathedral]], as well as significant work in Africa. 

In [[1956]] [[Peter Thomas Dunican|Peter Dunican]], later the Chairman of Arup and the President of the [[Institution of Structural Engineers]] was appointed as a partner. 

In [[1957]] the firm started working on the design of the new [[Sydney Opera House]] with the architect [[Jorn Utzon]].

Further partners appointed were Ronald Hobbs in [[1961]] and [[Povl Ahm]] and [[Jack Zunz]] in [[1965]]

In [[1963]], together with the architect [[Philip Dowson]], Arup Associates was formed to offer multi-disciplinary architectural and engineering services. Philip Dowson did not become a partner until [[1969]], after the firm was reformed again as "Ove Arup & Partners Consulting Engineers and Arup Associates" in [[1967]]. In [[1970]] the firm was again re-organised, with the "Ove Arup Partnership" becoming the parent company of "Ove Arup & Partners" and "Arup Associates". In the same year Ove Arup delivered what is known as "The Key Speech", a speech setting out the values of Arup.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arup.com/_assets/_download/FAF05210-19BB-316E-40AFF213E48D1CF1.pdf|title=Ove Arup's Key Speech|accessdate=2007-12-15|author=Ove Arup}}</ref>

By [[1973]] the firm reached 1500 employees. In the same year, the [[Sydney Opera House]] was finally opened, 16 years after the firm first started working on it.

In [[1977]], with the original partners nearing retirement, the firm was again reconstituted, with all of Ove Arup Partnership's equity owned by a trust for the benefit of its staff.

In [[1988]] Ove Arup died, and in [[1989]] "The Ove Arup Foundation" was established in his memory. By [[1991]] the firm had 3,500 permanent staff, and in [[1992]] the parent company Ove Arup Partnership became a private unlimited liability company, owned in trust for its employees. In [[1999]] it was changed to a [[limited company]].

Up to the end of the 20th century Arup's growth was entirely organic, but towards the end of the 20th century and during the first decade of the 21st century Arup has grown further with several mergers and acquisitions:

* [[1998]]: the water engineering part of the firm merged with Rofe Kennard & Lapworth, forming RKL-Arup.
* [[1999]]: the Advanced Technology Group merged with Design Research Associates Ltd and formed DRAL-Arup, providing vehicle design services.
* [[1999]]: Arup Communications merged with BMP Communications. 
* [[2000]]: merger with NAPA formed Arup NAPA, providing airports services.
* [[2000]]: merger with Jolyon Drury Consultants formed Arup-JDC, providing materials handling and logistics services.
* [[2006]]: acquisition of Rossmore, a [[Solihull]] based management consultancy.

In [[2001]] Arup Australia formally merged with Ove Arup Partnership Ltd, forming Arup Group Ltd. The entire firm is now known simply as '''Arup'''. The firm's official "mission" is ''to shape a better world''.<ref>{{cite web
