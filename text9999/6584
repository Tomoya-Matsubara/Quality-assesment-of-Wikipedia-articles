The '''western shovelnose stingaree''' (''Trygonoptera mucosa'')  is a common [[species]] of [[Myliobatiformes|stingray]] in the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Urolophidae]], inhabiting shallow sandy flats and [[seagrass]] beds off southwestern [[Australia]] from [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] to [[Gulf St Vincent]]. Growing to {{convert|37|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, this small ray has a rounded [[pectoral fin]] disc and a blunt, broadly triangular snout. Its nostrils have enlarged lobes along the outer rims and a skirt-shaped curtain of skin between them with a strongly fringed posterior margin. Its tail ends in a lance-like [[caudal fin]] and lacks [[dorsal fin]]s and lateral skin folds. This species is colored grayish to brownish above, sometimes with lighter and darker spots, and pale below, sometimes with darker marginal bands and blotches.

Sedentary [[polychaete worm]]s are by far the most important food source of the western shovelnose stingaree; other [[benthic]] [[invertebrate]]s and the odd [[bony fish]] may also be taken. Reproduction is [[aplacental viviparous]], with females bearing one or two pups annually in late May or early June. The [[gestation period]] lasts one year, during which the mother produces histotroph ("[[uterus|uterine]] milk") to nourish her developing [[embryo]]s. The [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) has assessed this species as of [[Least Concern]], as it faces little to no fishing pressure other than in the northwestern extreme of its range, where it is frequently [[bycatch|caught incidentally]] by [[trawl]]s. It usually survives to be discarded, though its tendency to abort its young when captured is of concern.

==Taxonomy==
Australian [[ichthyologist]] [[Gilbert Percy Whitley]] originally described the western shovelnose stingaree as ''Urolophus (Trygonoptera) mucosus'' in a 1939 volume of the [[scientific journal]] ''Australian Zoologist'', based on a specimen collected from [[King George Sound]] off [[Albany, Western Australia]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Whitley, G.P. |date=December 12, 1939 |title=Taxonomic notes on sharks and rays |journal=Australian Zoologist |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=227&ndash;262}}</ref> Subsequent authors have recognized ''Trygonoptera'' as having full generic status. This species is closely related to the recently described ''[[Trygonoptera galba|T. galba]]'' and ''[[Trygonoptera imitata|T. imitata]]'', with which it forms a [[species complex]] that may include additional undescribed species; one example is a form found off Perth that resembles ''T. mucosa'' but is much larger, reaching a length of {{convert|61|cm|in|abbr=on}}.<ref name="yearsley et al">{{cite book |author=Yearsley, G.K., P.R.

==Distribution and habitat==
The western shovelnose stingaree is [[endemism|endemic]] to southwestern Australia, where it is one of the most common representatives of its family.<ref name="platell et al">{{cite journal |author=Platell, M.E., I.C. Potter, and K.R. Clarke |title=Resource partitioning by four species of elasmobranchs (Batoidea: Urolophidae) in coastal waters of temperate Australia |journal=Marine Biology |date=1998 |volume=131 |pages=719&ndash;734}}</ref> Its range extends from the [[Gulf St Vincent]] near [[Glenelg, South Australia|Glenelg]] westward to [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], and possibly further north to [[Dongara]]. [[Benthic fish|Bottom-dwelling]] in nature, the western shovelnose stingaree inhabits sandy and [[seagrass]] [[habitat]]s at a depth of {{convert|1|-|40|m|ft|abbr=on}}, and particularly favors relatively deeper waters close [[inshore]]. Individuals of all ages and both sexes occupy the same [[habitat]]s year-round.<ref name="last and stevens"/><ref name="platell et al"/>

==Description==
The western shovelnose stingaree has a rounded [[pectoral fin]] disc slightly wider than long. The leading margins are nearly straight and converge at an obtuse angle on the fleshy snout, which has a blunt, non-protruding tip. The modestly sized eyes are followed by much larger, comma-shaped [[spiracle]]s, whose "tails" curl down and forward to beneath the anterior third of the eyeball; the posterior margins of the spiracles are angular. The outer rims of the nostrils are expanded into large, flattened lobes. Between the nostrils is a skirt-shaped curtain of skin with a deeply fringed posterior margin that obscures the small mouth. The lower jaw bears a patch of papillae (nipple-shaped structures). There are 7&ndash;9 small papillae across the floor of the mouth.<ref name="last and stevens"/> The teeth are small with roughly oval bases. The five pairs of [[gill slit]]s are short.<ref name="last and compagno">{{cite book |author=Last, P.R. and L.J.V. Compagno |chapter=Myliobatiformes: Urolophidae |editor=Carpenter, K.E. and V.H.

The [[pelvic fin]]s are small and rounded. The tail measures 71&ndash;91% of the disc length, has a flattened oval cross-section, and terminates in a low leaf-shaped [[caudal fin]]. The tail bears a serrated stinging spine on the dorsal surface about midway along its length; there are no [[dorsal fin]]s or lateral fin folds.<ref name="last and stevens"/><ref name="last and compagno"/> The skin is completely devoid of [[dermal denticle]]s. The western shovelnose stingaree is grayish to ochre to dark brown in color above, becoming dusky to black on the caudal fin; some rays also exhibit an irregular scattering of lighter and darker spots. The underside is white to beige, occasionally with a wide, dark brown band and blotches along the margins of the disc and tail, which is most obvious in juveniles.<ref name="last and stevens"/> This species has a maximum reported disc width of {{convert|28|cm|in|abbr=on}} for males and {{convert|37|cm|in|abbr=on}} for females.<ref name="iucn"/>

==Biology and ecology==
The proportionately larger spiracles of the western shovelnose stingaree suggest that it is [[adaptation|adapted]] for environments with lower [[dissolved oxygen]] levels than its close relatives.<ref name="iucn"/> This species feeds predominantly on [[polychaete worm]]s, which comprise over 85% of its diet by volume; of the polychaetes consumed, most are of the sedentary type that are typically found in buried [[tube worm (body plan)|tubes]]. The enlarged lobes and numerous sensory papillae adjacent to its mouth likely aid in locating, reaching and extracting such deep-burrowed prey; the ray also has a mechanism for avoiding the ingestion of [[sediment]], possibly by expelling it through the gill slits. [[Crustacean]]s, including [[shrimp]], [[amphipod]]s, [[isopod]]s, [[Mysidacea|mysids]], and [[Tanaidacea|tanaids]], and [[Sipuncula|sipunculid worm]]s constitute minor secondary food sources. [[Mollusc]]s, [[echinoderm]]s, and [[bony fish]]es are very rarely eaten. Rays of all ages have similar diets overall, though amphipods and tanaids are generally only taken by small rays, and sipunculids by large rays.<ref name="platell et al"/><ref>{{cite journal |title=Partitioning of food resources amongst 18 abundant benthic carnivorous fish species in marine waters on the lower west coast of Australia |author=Platell, M.E. and I.C.

Like other stingrays, the western shovelnose stingaree is [[aplacental viviparous]]; adult females have a single functional [[uterus]] (on the left), and produce litters of usually one, but rarely two, pups every year. [[Ovulation]] and [[mating]] occurs in May or June. Newly fertilized eggs are enclosed by a thin brown membrane, and may undergo a short period of [[diapause]] (suspended development) before the onset of embryonic growth, as is the case in related species such as ''[[Trygonoptera personata|T. personata]]''. The total [[gestation period]] lasts about a year; once the developing [[embryo]]s exhaust their supply of [[yolk]], they are supplied with [[nutrient]]-rich histotroph ("uterine milk") by the mother. Parturition takes place in late May or early June. Newly born rays measure around {{convert|11|cm|in|abbr=on}} across. Females grow slower and to a larger ultimate size than males; [[sexual maturity]] is attained at roughly {{convert|22|cm|in|abbr=on}} across and two years of age for males, and {{convert|25|cm|in|abbr=on}} across and five years of age for females. The [[maximum lifespan]] is 12 years for males and 17 years for females.<ref name="iucn"/><ref>{{cite journal |title=Reproductive biology and growth during pre- and postnatal life of ''Trygonoptera personata'' and ''T. mucosa'' (Batoidea : Urolophidae) |author=White, W.T., N.G. Hall, and I.C. Potter |journal=Marine Biology |volume=140 |issue=4 |pages=699&ndash;712 |date=April 2002}}</ref>

==Human interactions==
Because of its abundance, the western shovelnose stingaree is regularly [[bycatch|caught incidentally]] by a small number of [[scallop]] and [[prawn]] [[trawl]]ers operating off Perth and [[Mandurah]] in the northwestern portion of its range, and possibly also by the South Australian Prawn Fisheries operating at the eastern limit of its range. Lacking economic value, it is usually released alive when captured, though of concern is the fact that stingarees tend to abort their young when captured. Nevertheless, most of this species' range sees little to no fishing activity, and as a result the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) has listed it under [[Least Concern]]. This species would potentially benefit from the implementation of the 2004 Australian National Plan of Action for the Conservation and Management of Sharks.<ref name="iucn"/>
