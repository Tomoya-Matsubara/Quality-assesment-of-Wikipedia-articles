==Music video==
[[File:FreedomMinaj.jpg|230px|thumbnail|left|Minaj wearing a gold gown with a cross.]]
The video was shot in [[black-and-white]]. It begins with a [[stairway]] set in a [[foggy]] setting leading up to the sky. Then angles of different scenery are shown such as a deserted area with a boat next to railroad resembling [[Noah's Ark]], railroad pathaway, and a [[True Cross]] with a key hung over it. Minaj is shown fading into clouds, before she raps her first verse wearing a black flowing dress and a [[crown of thorns]]. Minaj has various wardrobe changes in the video. Minaj is then seen dressed as a [[Queen regnant|queen]], over a balcony with a spiral chandelier behind her. Various clips of nature are shown such as [[waves]], [[birds]], and [[grass]]. Minaj is then seen singing the chorus in a blonde wig, in a vast space, with a lot of fog. Minaj raps her second verse sitting on a [[throne]] donning a black wig similar to the on she wore in her previous music video for "[[I Am Your Leader]]". After scenes of nature and of Minaj, the video transforms into color. The video concludes as Minaj is seen with a stray-like face, walking in the wilderness, while clips of Minaj singing continue throughout the video. It closes with the stairway, seen in the beginning of the video. Tom Eames of [[Digital Spy]] complimented the video for its "glamorous" shots of Minaj,<ref name="Digital2">{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.ca/music/news/a439423/nicki-minaj-glams-up-in-new-music-video-for-freedom-watch-now.html |title=Nicki Minaj glams up in new music video for 'Freedom' |first=Tom |last=Eames |work=''Digital Spy'' |publisher=Hearst Magazines UK |date=November 20, 2012 |accessdate=April 9, 2013 }}</ref> a sentiment echoed by Liza Darwin of [[MTV News]], who said: "We already know Nicki's got her beauty and fashion game on lock these days, but for her new vid the singer ditches the bustiers, tutus, and Zenon-inspired ensembles for a toned-down (for her, at least) wardrobe of glittery gowns, decadent furs, and more than one crown.
