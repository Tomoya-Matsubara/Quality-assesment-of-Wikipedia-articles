'''Ni Putes Ni Soumises''' (''Neither Whores Nor Submissive'') is a [[French feminist]] movement, founded in 2002, which has secured the recognition of the French [[news|press]] and the [[National Assembly of France]]. It is generally dependent on public funding. It is also the name of a book written by [[Fadela Amara]], one of the leaders of the movement, with the help of ''[[Le Monde]]'' journalist Sylvia Zappi.

Fadela Amara was appointed as junior minister for urban policy in [[Fran<U+00E7>ois Fillon]]'s [[Fran<U+00E7>ois_Fillon#Fillon.27s_First_Government|first government]] in May 2007. She left the government in 2010, and was named France's [[inspector general]] for social affairs in January 2011.<ref>{{Cite news | title = Fadela Amara nomm<U+00E9>e inspectrice g<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>rale des affaires sociales | newspaper = Le Monde | language = French | date = 2011-01-05 | url = http://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2011/01/05/fadela-amara-nommee-inspectrice-generale-des-affaires-sociales_1461414_3224.html | accessdate = 2011-03-24}}</ref>

NPNS was set up by a group of young French women, including [[Samira Bellil]], in response to the violence being directed at them in the suburbs (''[[banlieues]]'') and [[housing estate]]s (''cit<U+00E9>s'') of cities such as [[Paris]], [[Lyon]] and [[Toulouse]], where [[rape]] and violence towards women have occurred at relatively high rates.

[[Image:Ni Putes Ni Soumises cover.jpg|thumb|left|The book cover]]

The movement fights against violence targeting women and it targets [[Gang rape|Gang-rapes]] as well as social pressures. Some have claimed that Muslim French girls face pressures to wear the [[hijab]], drop out of school, and [[forced marriage|marry]] early without being able to choose the husband.<ref name="LFC" />

The slogan used by the movement is meant both to shock and mobilise. Members particularly protest against changes of attitudes toward women, claiming there is an increased influence of [[radical Islam]] in those French suburbs that are mostly inhabited by people of the "Islamic" [[Maghreb]] [North Africa].{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} A particular concern is the treatment of [[Islam in France|Muslim]] [[women in Islam|women]]. Members claim that they may be pressured into wearing [[Veil#In_Islam|veils]], leaving school, and marrying early.<ref name="LFC" /> However, the movement represents women of all faiths and ethnic origins, all of whom may find themselves trapped by poverty and the [[ghetto]]isation of the ''cit<U+00E9>s''.

A translation of the key points of NPNS's national appeal on its official website:<ref>[http://www.niputesnisoumises.com/ Ni Putes Ni Soumises - Le Site Officiel -]</ref>
*No more moralising: our condition has worsened. The media and politics have done nothing, or very little, for us.
*No more wretchedness. We are fed up with people speaking for us, with being treated with contempt.
*No more justifications of our oppression in the name of the right to be different and of respect toward those who force us to bow our heads.
*No more silence in public debates about violence, poverty and discrimination.

==Early history==

Two high-profile cases gave a particular impetus to NPNS during 2003. The first was that of [[Samira Bellil]], who published a book called ''Dans l'enfer des tournantes'' ("In Gang Rape Hell") in which she recounts her life as a girl under ''la loi des cit<U+00E9>s'' (the law of the housing estates) where she was gang [[rape]]d on more than one occasion, the first time at age 13, afraid to speak out, and ultimately seen only as a sexual object, alienated and shunned by her family and some of her friends. The second case was that of 17-year-old [[Sohanne Benziane]] who was burned alive by an alleged small-time gang leader.

In the wake of these events, members of ''Ni Putes Ni Soumises'' staged a march through France, which started in February 2003 and passed through to over 20 cities before culminating in a 30,000-strong demonstration in Paris on March 8, 2003. The march was officially called ''la Marche des femmes des quartiers contre les ghettos et pour l'<U+00E9>galit<U+00E9>'' (The March of Women from the [[Public housing|housing estates]] against [[ghetto]]es and for equality).

Representatives of Ni Putes Ni Soumises were received by French Prime Minister [[Jean Pierre Raffarin]]. Their message was also incorporated into the official celebrations of [[Bastille Day]] 2003 in Paris, when 14 giant posters each of a modern woman dressed as [[Marianne]], the symbol of the French Republic, were hung on the columns of the [[Palais Bourbon]], the home of the [[French National Assembly|Assembl<U+00E9>e nationale]] (the lower house of the French parliament).

The following five propositions were accepted by the French government:
#The publication of an educational guide dealing with respect, to be distributed in the housing projects and schools.
#The establishment of [[safe house]]s away from the housing estates for girls and women in immediate distress, where they can be safe in relative anonymity.
#The creation of six pilot sites where women will be able to have their voices heard.
#The organisation of training seminars for women to develop their particular strengths.
#Special provisions made in police stations for girls and women who have been the victims of violence.

== Criticisms ==
{{See|Feminism in France}}
''Ni Putes Ni Soumises'' has been criticized by various [[Feminism in France|French feminists]] and [[left-wing]] authors (Sylvie Tissot,<ref name=Tissot> Sylvie Tissot, [http://www.gisti.org/spip.php?article1072 Bilan d<U+2019>un f<U+00E9>minisme d<U+2019><U+00C9>tat], in ''Plein Droit'' n<U+00B0>75, December 2007 </ref> Elsa Dorlin,<ref name=Dorlin> Elsa Dorlin (professor of philosophy at the [[Sorbonne University|Sorbonne]], member of [[NextGenderation]]), [http://www.lautrecampagne.org/article.php?id=132 <U+00AB> Pas en notre nom ! <U+00BB> - Contre la r<U+00E9>cup<U+00E9>ration raciste du f<U+00E9>minisme par la droite fran<U+00E7>aise] (Not in our names!

Houria Bouteldja qualified ''Ni Putes ni Soumises'' as an [[Ideological State Apparatus]] (AIE).<ref name=Bouteldja/> The debate among the [[French Left]] concerning the [[French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools|2004 law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools]], mainly targeted against the ''[[hijab]]'', is to be seen under this light.<ref name=Tissot/> They underline that, first, sexism is not a specificity of immigrant populations, as if French culture itself was devoid of sexism, and second, that the focus on mediatic and violent acts passes under silence the [[precarization]] of women.<ref name=Tissot/><ref name=Dorlin/>

Sylvie Tissot writes that Amara collaborated with the ''[[Cercle de l'Oratoire]]'' (a think-tank which supported the [[Iraq War|US invasion of Iraq]]), and Mohammed Abdi, the current president of the NGO, is a member of this think-tank.<ref> [http://www.recherches-sur-le-terrorisme.com/Documentsterrorisme/fadela-amara-biographie.html Qui est Fadela Amara?] {{fr icon}}</ref>
