The '''Krak<U+00F3>w pogrom''' refers to the events that occurred on [[August 11]], [[1945]], in the city of [[Krak<U+00F3>w]], [[Poland]], which resulted in one dead and five wounded victims.

==Background==
Around 68,000<U+2013>80,000 [[Jew]]s lived in [[Krak<U+00F3>w]] before the [[German invasion of Poland]] in September, 1939. Resulting from the [[Holocaust]] and further migration only 500 were present by January 1945 immediately after the [[East Prussian Offensive|arrival]] of the Soviet [[Red Army]].<ref name="Cichopek87"/> This number gradually increased as nearly 2,000 prewar inhabitans of the city retured home. Many Jewish refugees returned to Krak<U+00F3>w from the [[Soviet Union]], including those who came from the neighbouring villages and towns.<ref name="Cichopek223">Anna Cichopek, The Cracow pogrom of August 1945, p. 223.</ref><ref name="Dylewski">Adam Dylewski, [http://www.diapozytyw.pl/en/site/slady_i_judaica/krakow  Where the Tailor Was a Poet...] website created under the aegis of the Adam Mickiewicz Institute, Warsaw; chief editor: Dr. Piotr M. A. Cywinski. Editorial assistance: Dr. Anna Marta Szczepan-Wojnarska, and Kaja Wieczorek from Jewish Historical Institute, Warsaw</ref> 

By May 1945, the number of Jews in the city reached 6,637.
The return of the Jewish population was not always welcomed, especially by the [[anti-Semitic]] elements in the populace. The [[Anti-Jewish violence in Poland, 1944-1946|safety of the Jewish community]] in Krak<U+00F3>w was becoming a very serious problem, even though "no serious antisemitic events were recorded in the rural and small-town regions."<ref name="JDZ(1)>Joshua D.

{{quote|''In regard to the attitudes of the Polish population towards the Jews, the remnants of [[Nazi]] influences acquired during the occupation still linger... Robberies combined with murdering Jews occur: the motives and the perpetrators are usually not found. Nevertheless, their anti-Semitic background is apparent...In the previous month there were no serious anti-Jewish events in the voivodeship, yet there is no evidence that society's attitude towards the the Jews has changed ... An utterly insignificant event, or the most improbable rumour can trigger serious riots. The populace's attitude towards the Jews is a serious problem requiring a constant vigilance on the side of the authorities, and proper interaction with lower level offices.<ref name="Cichopek223" />}}

== Unrest ==
On June 27, 1945, a Jewish woman was brought to a local [[Milicja Obywatelska]] [[police station]] falsely accused of attempting to abduct a child. Despite the fact that the investigation revealed that the mother had left her child in the care of the suspect, rumours started to spread that a Jewish woman abducted a child in order to kill it.<ref name="Cichopek224"> Anna Cichopek, The Cracow pogrom of August 1945 p. 224.</ref> A mob shouting anti-Jewish slogans gathered at Kleparski square, but a Milicja detachment brought the situation under control. [[Blood libel against Jews|Blood libel]] rumours continued to spread. False claims that thirteen corpses of Christian children allegedly had been discovered were disseminated. By 11 August, the number of rumoured "victims" had grown to eighty.<ref name="Cichopek224"/> Groups of [[hooligan]]s who gathered at Kleparski Square had been throwing stones at the [[Kupa Synagogue]] on a weekly basis.<ref name="Cichopek224"/> On 11 August an attempt to seize a thirteen year old boy who was throwing stones at the synagogue was made, but he managed to escape and rushed to the nearby marketplace screaming "Help me, the Jews have tried to kill me".<ref name="Onet">Marcin Zaremba ''[http://wiadomosci.onet.pl/1345444,1292,1,kioskart.html Psychoza we krwi]''.

Jewish men, women and children, were beaten up on the streets; their homes were broken into and robbed.<ref name="Onet"/> Some Jews wounded during the pogrom were hospitalized and later were beaten in the hospitals again. One of the pogrom victims witnessed: 

{{quote|''I was carried to the second precinct of the militia where they called for an ambulance. There were five more people over there, including badly wounded Polish woman. In the ambulance I heard the comments of the escorting soldier and the nurse who spoke about us as Jewish scum whom they have to save, and that they shouldn't be doing this because we murdered children, that all of us should be shot. We were taken to the hospital of St. Lazarus at Kopernika Street. I was first taken to the operating room. After the operation a soldier appeared who said that he will take everybody to jail after the operation. He beat up one of the wounded Jews waiting for an operation. He held us under cocked gun and did not allow us to take a drink of water. A moment later two railroadmen appeared and one said, "It's a scandal that a Pole does not have the civil courage to hit a defenceless person", and he hit a wounded Jew. One of the hospital inmates hit me with a crutch. Women, including nurses, stood behind the doors threatening us that they were only waiting for the operation to be over in order to rip us apart'' <ref name="Retribution"/>}}

There is one record of a death relating to Krak<U+00F3>w events in the archives of the Forensic Medicine Department in Krak<U+00F3>w.

she also noted that in an archival photo of a funeral there were five coffins visible, thus suggesting that there might have been five fatalities; she also claimed in her book that the [[New York Times]] in 1946 had noted a death of a man (Anszel Zucker), and [[Polska Agencja Prasowa]] noted a death of another unknown woman (in addition to R<U+00F3><U+017C>a Berger) and five wounded.<ref name="Cichopek87"/>

Polish historian, Dr [[Julian Kwiek]], who has published existing Polish documents regarding the Krak<U+00F3>w event stated that he is not familiar with the documents quoted by Cichopek from outside the scientific literature. He stated that one death is confirmed in all historical sources, therefore it is questionable whether this event truly falls under the definition of a [[pogrom]],<ref name="Kwiek2">Translation of Magdalena Tytu<U+0142>a, ''Kielce na Kazimierzu'', [[Gazeta Wyborcza]] (local 'Gazeta w Krakowie'), [[August 11]], [[2000]], [http://www.forum-znak.org.pl/index-en.php?t=przeglad&id=1330 (English)]</ref> even though most other sources refer to the event as such.<ref name="Szaynok">{{cite book | author =Bozena Szaynok  | editor =Robert Blobaum | title =Antisemitism And Its Opponents In Modern Poland | year =2005 | editor = | pages = 272 | chapter =The Role of Antisemitism in Postwar Polish-Jewish Relations | publisher =Cornell University Press| oclc=57557379 | isbn=0801489695  }}</ref> <ref name="Michlic"/> <ref name="Engel"/> <ref name="Retribution">{{cite book | author =Istv<U+00E1>n De<U+00E1>k | coauthors=Jan Tomasz Gross, Tony Judt | title =The politics of retribution in Europe : World War II and its aftermath | year =2000 | pages = 111 | chapter = | publisher =Princeton University Press | location=Princeton, N.J | url=http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0691009546&id=s82F2H0FEHQC&pg=PA111&lpg=PA111&ots=TzLGIZi_-H&dq=soldiers+and+militiamen+cracow+pogrom&sig=j6pqJCW76yOyez2H5XhhDBkDxCk | oclc=43840165 | isbn=0691009538 }}</ref> <ref name="Naimark">{{cite book | author =Norman M Naimark  | editor =Christiane Lemke | title =The Crisis of Socialism in Europe | year =1992 | pages = 77 | chapter =Revolution and Counterrevolution in Eastern Europe | publisher =Duke University Press| oclc=23462173  | isbn=0822311976 }}</ref> <ref name="Onet"/> <ref name="Dobroszycki2">From David Engel: "Patterns Of Anti-Jewish Violence In Poland, 1944-1946."

[http://www.holocaustresearch.pl/index1.htm]</ref> of the [[Polish Academy of Sciences]], suggested that the photos showing the coffins were taken in the Spring (April 24, 1946) of the following year and came from the Krakow funeral of five Jews shot on April 21, 1946 by partisans of [[J<U+00F3>zef Kura<U+015B>]] "Ogie<U+0144>" near Nowy Targ. In many cases <U+2013> Libionka suggested <U+2013> it would have been more appropriate if Anna Cichopek relied on existing studies rather than on archival material. He stated, that [[Polska Agencja Prasowa]] noted one dead person and five wounded. Dr Libionka questioned the source of information regarding Anszel Zucker's death. According to him it should have been concluded that the Krak<U+00F3>w pogrom resulted in one dead and five wounded victims.<ref>{{pl icon}} [http://pl.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dyskusja%3APogrom_w_Krakowie&diff=7037385&oldid=7015923 Dariusz Libionka's opinion about Cichopek's version in Polish Wikipedia]</ref>
