A 1978 review of Roth's work by architecture critic [[Paul Goldberger]] in [[The New York Times]] commented that "the Roth firm took on modernism slowly--the Normandy apartments of 1938 at 140 Riverside Drive have an Art Deco-like base, but the ornamental housing for the water tower lurches back suddenly to the Italian Renaissance.  There were a few other such schizophrenic designs from the 30's and buildings such as 930 Fifth Avenue and 875 Fifth Avenue of 1940 show a gradual disappearance of the old ornament."<ref name="78times">{{cite news | url= http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0C11F73F5413728DDDAF0994DA405B888BF1D3 | title= Emery Roth dominated the age of apartment buildings | author= [[Paul Goldberger]] | publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' | date= February 16, 1978 | accessdate=March 1, 2010}}</ref>
