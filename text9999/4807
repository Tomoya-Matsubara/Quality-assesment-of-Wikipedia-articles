'''William de Corbeil''' or '''William of Corbeil''' (''[[circa|c]]''. 1070&ndash; 1136) was a medieval [[archbishop of Canterbury]]. Educated as a theologian, he served the bishops of Durham and London before becoming a [[Canon (priest)|canon]]. He was elected as a compromise to the [[see of Canterbury]] in 1123, succeeding [[Ralph d'Escures]] who had employed William as a chaplain. William was the first canon to become archbishop in England. 

William was soon involved in a dispute over primacy with [[Thurstan]], [[archbishop of York]], and he also concerned himself with the morals of the clergy.  He was known as a builder, having built the [[keep]] of [[Rochester Castle]] in England. At the end of his life, William was instrumental in the selection of [[Stephen of England|Count Stephen of Boulogne]] as king of England instead of the [[Empress Matilda]], daughter of King [[Henry I of England]].

==Early life==
William de Corbeil was born probably at [[Corbeil]] on the [[Seine]] possibly around 1070,<ref name=DNB>[[Frank Barlow (historian)|Barlow, Frank]], "Corbeil, William de (d. 1136)" ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' Oxford University Press, 2004 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/6284 Online Edition] accessed November 8, 2007</ref> and was educated at [[Laon]], where he taught for a while.<ref name=HenryI23>Hollister, C. Warren ''Henry I'' ed. by Amanda Clark Frost New Haven:Yale University Press 2001 ISBN 0-300-08858-2 p. 23</ref> His teacher at Laon was [[Anselm of Laon]], the noted [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] and teacher of theology.<ref name=HenryI432>Hollister, C. Warren ''Henry I'' ed. by Amanda Clark Frost New Haven:Yale University Press 2001 ISBN 0-300-08858-2 p. 432</ref> He had two brothers, Ranulf and Helgot, but nothing else is known about his parents or upbringing.<ref name=DNB/>

He was soon in the service of [[Ranulf Flambard]], [[bishop of Durham]] and also [[Richard de Beaumis]] [[bishop of London]]; then, having entered the [[Augustinians|Augustinian]] order at [[Holy Trinity Priory]] in [[Aldgate]],<ref name=DNB/> he became [[prior]] of the Augustinian foundation at [[St Osyth]] in [[Essex, England|Essex]].<ref name=Knowles183>[[David Knowles|Knowles, David]]; Brooke C.

==Archbishop of Canterbury==
After the death of Ralph d'Escures in October of 1122, [[Henry I of England|King Henry I]] decided to allow a free election, and the new primate was chosen by the leading men of the realm, both ecclesiastical and secular.<ref name=Cantor282>[[Norman Cantor|Cantor, Norman F.]] ''Church, Kingship, and Lay Investiture in England 1089-1135'' Princeton, NJ:Princeton University Press 1958 p. 282</ref> The usual arguments broke out between the monks of the chapter and the bishops of the kingdom; with the bishops insisting on the election of a non-monk, and the monks insisting that they alone had the right to elect the archbishop and that the new archbishop must be a monk. However, only two bishops in either England or Normandy at this time were monks ([[Ernulf]] [[Bishop of Rochester]] and [[Serlo]] [[Bishop of S<U+00E9>ez]]), and no monk other than [[Anselm of Canterbury]], Ernulf, and Ralph d'Escures had been elected to an English or Norman see since 1091, so recent precedent favored the bishops.<ref name=BlackMonks/> King Henry sided with the bishops, and told the monks they could elect their choice from a short list selected by the bishops. The list, of course, contained no monks.<ref name=HenryI288>Hollister, C. Warren ''Henry I'' ed. by Amanda Clark Frost New Haven:Yale University Press 2001 ISBN 0-300-08858-2 p. 288-289</ref> 

[[Image:Henry1.jpg|thumb|right|Henry I from a 13th century manuscript of Matthew Paris]]
On [[February 4]] [[1123]],<ref name=Powicke210>[[Maurice Powicke|Powicke, F. Maurice]] and E. B. Fryde ''Handbook of British Chronology'' 2nd. ed. London:Royal Historical Society 1961 p. 210</ref> William was chosen from among four candidates to the [[see of Canterbury]], but the other three candidates names are not known.<ref name=BlackMonks/> William refused to admit that [[Thurstan]], archbishop of York, was independent of the [[see of Canterbury]], so Thurstan refused to consecrate him. Instead, the ceremony was performed by William's own [[Suffragan bishop|suffragan]] bishops on [[February 18]] [[1123]].<ref name=HenryI288/><ref name=Powicke210/> William was the first Augustinian consecrated Archbishop in England, a striking break with tradition that had favored monks in the see of Canterbury.<ref name=Monastic175>[[David Knowles|Knowles, Dom David]] ''The Monastic Order in England: From the Times of St. Dunstan to the Fourth Lateran Council'' Second Edition Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1976 reprint ISBN 0-521-05479-6 p. 175</ref> As such, he caused some trepidation in the monks of the Canterbury chapter, who were "alarmed at the appointment, since he was a clerk," clerk here meaning a non-monastic clergy-member.<ref name=Bartlett399>quoted in [[Robert Bartlett (historian)|Bartlett, Robert]] ''England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings: 1075-1225'' Oxford:Clarendon Press 2000 ISBN 0-19-822741-8 p. 399</ref>

Proceeding to [[Rome]] the new archbishop found that Thurstan had anticipated his arrival in that city and had made out a strong case against him to [[Pope Calixtus II]]. There were four objections against William's election, first that he was elected in the king's court, second that the chapter of Canterbury had been coerced and was unwilling, third that his consecration was unlawful because it was not performed by Thurstan, and fourth that a monk should be elected to the see of Canterbury, which had been founded by Saint [[Augustine of Canterbury]], a monk.<ref name=BlackMonks/> However, the exertions of the English king Henry I and of the emperor [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]], King Henry I's son-in-law, prevailed, and the pope gave William the [[pallium]], but not without making William swear to obey "all things that the Pope imposed upon him."<ref name=HenryI288/><ref name=Cantor312>quoted in [[Norman Cantor|Cantor, Norman F.]] ''Church, Kingship, and Lay Investiture in England 1089-1135'' Princeton, NJ:Princeton University Press 1958 p. 312-313</ref> It was at the same time that the Pope decided against Canterbury in the primacy dispute with York, when the forged documents that the Canterbury monks presented as evidence were dismissed as forgeries.<ref name=BlackMonks/> William then returned to England, and was enthroned at Canterbury on [[July 22]] [[1123]].<ref name=DNB/>

The archbishop's next dispute was with the papal legate of the new Pope [[Honorius II]], Cardinal John of Crema, who had arrived in England and was acting in an autocratic manner.<ref name=Cantor312/> Again travelling to Rome, William gained another victory, and was himself appointed [[papal legate]] in England and Scotland by [[Pope Honorius II]] in 1126,<ref name=Barlow44/> a precedent of considerable importance in the history of the English Church. In ecclesiastical matters, William called [[Synod|legatine councils]] in 1125, 1127 and 1129 all at [[Winchester]]. The one in 1125 met under the direction of John of Crema, and prohibited [[simony]], purchase of the [[sacraments]], and the inheritance of clerical [[benefice]]s. In 1127 the council condemned the purchase of benefices or the entry to clerical orders or of entry to religious houses. Lastly, in 1129 the clergy were once more admonished to live a celibate life and to put aside their wives.<ref name=Cantor275>[[Norman Cantor|Cantor, Norman F.]] ''Church, Kingship, and Lay Investiture in England 1089-1135'' Princeton, NJ:Princeton University Press 1958 p. 275-276</ref> The [[Feast of the Immaculate Conception|festival of the Conception]] was also allowed at one of these councils.<ref name=Barlow195>Barlow, Frank ''The English Church 1066-1154'' London:Longman 1979 ISBN 0-582-50236-5 p. 195</ref> William also seems to have been somewhat eclipsed in ecclesiastical administration and appointments by [[Roger of Salisbury]], [[Bishop of Salisbury]] and King Henry's primary advisor.<ref name=Cantor299>[[Norman Cantor|Cantor, Norman F.]] ''Church, Kingship, and Lay Investiture in England 1089-1135'' Princeton, NJ:Princeton University Press 1958 p. 299</ref> However, William reformed the nunnery of [[Minster-in-Sheppey]], and put a college of regular canons at the church of St. Gregory's, in Canterbury.<ref name=DNB/>

==William as builder==
William built the [[keep]] of [[Rochester Castle]],<ref name=Bartlett277>[[Robert Bartlett (historian)|Bartlett, Robert]] ''England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings: 1075-1225'' Oxford:Clarendon Press 2000 ISBN 0-19-822741-8 p. 277</ref> and finished the building of the [[Canterbury cathedral|cathedral]] at Canterbury, which was dedicated with great pomp in May of 1130. The work at Rochester was built within the stone curtain walls that [[Gundulf of Rochester]] had erected in the late eleventh century. William built a stone keep within the  walls for King Henry. The keep was not only designed for defense, but also had comfortable living quarters, which were probably intended for the use of the archbishops when they visited [[Rochester]].<ref name=Platt23>Platt, Colin ''The Castle in Medieval England & Wales'' reprint New York:Barnes & Noble Books 1996 ISBN 0-76070-054-0 p. 23-24</ref> In 1127, the custody of Rochester Castle was granted to William and his successors as archbishop by King Henry, including the right to fortify the place as the archbishops wished, and the right to garrison the castle with their own men.<ref name=DuBoulay80>DuBoulay, F. R. H. ''The Lordship of Canterbury: An Essay on Medieval Society'' New York: Barnes & Noble 1966 p. 80</ref> He also built a new church at [[Dover]] which he planned to staff with canons from [[Merton Priory]], but the plan was interrupted by William's death, and the church instead was staffed from [[St Augustine's Abbey]], Canterbury.<ref name=DNB/>

==The death of King Henry and the coronation of King Stephen==
The archbishop had sworn to Henry I that he would support the claim of his daughter [[Empress Matilda|Matilda]] to the English crown, but nevertheless William crowned [[Stephen I of England|Stephen]] after Henry's death.<ref name=Barlow85/> The archbishop was persuaded to do so by [[Henry of Blois]], [[Bishop of Winchester]] and Stephen's brother, and it was this persuasion that lead to Stephen's crowning on [[December 22]] [[1135]].<ref name=Huscroft72>Huscroft, Richard ''Ruling England 1042-1217'' London: Pearson Longman 2005 ISBN 0-582-84882-2 p. 72</ref><ref name=HenryI478>Hollister, C. Warren ''Henry I'' ed. by Amanda Clark Frost New Haven:Yale University Press 2001 ISBN 0-300-08858-2 p. 478-479</ref> [[Roger of Salisbury]] also was party to the consultations, and both bishops persuaded the archbishop that the oath had been imposed wrongly by Henry, and that in any event, the dying king had released the barons and the bishops from the oath. The royal steward, [[Hugh Bigod, 1st Earl of Norfolk|Hugh Bigod]] swore that he had been present at the deathbed, and had heard the king say that he released the oath.<ref name=Norman247>Crouch, David ''The Normans: The History of the Dynasty'' London:Hambledon Continuum 2007 ISBN 1-85285-595-9 p. 247</ref> William did not long outlive Henry, as he died at Canterbury on [[November 21]] [[1136]].<ref name=Powicke210/> William was buried in the north [[transept]] of Canterbury Cathedral.<ref name=DNB/>

Contemporaries were grudging in their praise, and William's reputation suffered after the ascension of Matilda's son [[Henry II of England]] to the throne. [[William of Malmesbury]] said that William was a courteous and sober man, with little of the flamboyant lifestyle of the more "modern" bishops. The ''[[Gesta Stephani]]'' author claimed that he was avaricious, and hoarded money. None of the chroniclers, however, doubted his piety, even when they named him a perjuror and a traitor for his coronation of Stephen.<ref name=DNB/>
