}}The '''John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum''' is the [[presidential library]] and [[museum]] of the 35th [[President of the United States]], [[John F. Kennedy]]. It is located on [[Dorchester, Massachusetts|Dorchester]]'s Columbia Point in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], [[United States|USA]], next to the Boston campus of the [[University of Massachusetts]]. It was designed by the architect [[I. M. Pei]]. The building is the official repository for original papers and correspondence of the Kennedy Administration, as well as special bodies of published and unpublished materials, such as books and papers by and about [[Ernest Hemingway]]. The library and museum were dedicated in 1979 by President [[Jimmy Carter]] and members of the [[Kennedy family]]. It can be reached from nearby [[Interstate 93]] or via [[shuttle]] bus from the [[JFK/UMass (MBTA station)|JFK/UMass]] stop on the [[Red Line (MBTA)|Boston subway's Red line]].

At the time there were only four other [[Presidential Library|Presidential Libraries]]; The [[Hoover Presidential Library]], the [[Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library|Franklin D. Roosevelt Library]], the [[Truman Library]], and the [[Dwight D. Eisenhower Library]]. They were all scattered around the country in small towns from New York to Iowa. He hadn<U+2019>t decided on any design concept yet, but he felt that the existing Presidential Libraries were placed too far <U+201C>away from scholarly resources.<U+201D><ref name="Franklin" />

Kennedy chose a plot of land next to the [[Harvard Graduate School of Business Administration|Graduate School of Business Administration]].<ref name="Franklin" /> The building would face the [[Charles River]] which was a few feet away, and on the other side of which, the dormitories that included [[Winthrop House]] where Kennedy spent his upperclassman days.<ref name="Franklin" /> Kennedy was [[JFK assassination|assassinated]] a month later, on [[November 22]], [[1963]].

Being that Kennedy encouraged his [[Kennedy Administration|Administration]] to save affects of both personal and official nature, the complex would not just be a collection of the President<U+2019>s papers, but <U+201C>a complete record of a Presidential era.<U+201D> And so, the building would have the word museum appended to its name: '''John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum'''.<ref name="Franklin" />

===Initial progress===
Progress on the building began shortly after his death. On January 13, 1964, the then [[Attorney General]] [[Robert F. Kennedy]] announced that a taped oral-history project was to be undertaken for inclusion in the library. The project would feature his Administration staff, friends, [[Kennedy family|family]] and politicians from home and abroad. The Attorney General also announced that [[Eugene R. Black, Sr.]] agreed to serve as chairman of the board of trustees and that $1 million of Black<U+2019>s $10 million goal had been given to the trust by the [[Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. Foundation]].<ref name="LewisJanuary">{{cite news | first = Anthony | last = Lewis | authorlink = | author = Anthony Lewis | coauthors = | title = Taped Oral History of Kennedy to Go in Projected Library | url = http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F0071FF9385C147A93C6A8178AD85F408685F9 | format = PDF | work = Special to The New York Times | publisher = The New York Times | location = Washington | id = | pages = | page = | date = 1964-01-13 | accessmonthday = August 16 |accessyear = 2008| language = English | quote = | archiveurl = | archivedate = }}</ref>

Over the following months pledges continued to funnel in for the building still being conceptualized by the various architects. Some notable donations include $900,000 handed over to the [[Postmaster General]], [[John A. Gronouski]] on July 9, 1964. It was the sum of a campaign encompassing 102 Federal agencies.

On May 22, 1971, President Kennedy<U+2019>s [[Vice President]] and successor, [[Lyndon B.

On the campus of the [[University of Texas at Austin]], and next to the [[LBJ School of Public Affairs]], he would beat the Kennedy team to building the first Presidential Library that also served as a place of scholarly research. He would not live to see work begin on his predecessors.

Meanwhile, the Cambridge community was in fierce opposition of having library being built in Cambridge at all. Although originally welcomed in 1965, the library was now seen as a great attractor of over a million annual tourists who would change the neighborhood with <U+201C>hordes of tourists, automobiles, fast-food franchises and souvenir shops,<U+201D><ref name="KifnerBlockedby">{{cite news

In all seriousness, he asserted that one could toss a lit match on the earth and watch the ground ignite as the soil emitted [[methane gas]].<ref name="WGBH" /> One thing the site did have going for it was that the community was not opposed to the area being [[landscaped]] to house the library.

June 12, 1977 marked the official [[groundbreaking ceremony|groundbreaking]] for the library with construction following in August. Although the site was a landfill it did overlook Boston, [[Dorchester Bay]] and the [[Atlantic ocean|ocean]].

The design would be a simple geometric structure with a large glass pavilion. The concrete tower stands {{convert|125|ft|m}} tall and houses offices and archives. A circular section contains two theaters and is connected to the tower by the {{convert|115|foot|m}} grey-glass pavilion. The [[concrete]] finish of the building directly reflects the budget.<ref name="Huxtable1979" /> With more money Pei would have made the building with stone which he believes offers a nicer finish with more detail.<ref name="WGBH" /> The materials chosen kept the costs within budget, in total costing $20.8 million.<ref name="Huxtable1979" />

=== Dedication ===
The official dedication was held on October 20, 1979. Outside the building on [[lawn|the green]], on a blue-carpeted stage with a bank of yellow [[chrysanthemum]]s sat the Kennedy family and those close to them. Among many others, President [[Jimmy Carter]] was in their company. The ceremony began with President Kennedy<U+2019>s daughter, [[Caroline Kennedy]], introducing her brother, [[John F. Kennedy, Jr.]], who read from the [[Stephen Spender]] poem, ''I Think Continually of Those Who Were Truly Great''.

President Carter said of John F. Kennedy that he embodied <U+201C>the ideals of a generation as few public figures have ever done in the history of the earth.<U+201D><ref name="TerranceSmith">{{cite news

==Features==
The library's first floor features a museum containing video monitors, family photographs, political memorabilia. Visitors to the museum begin their visit by watching a film narrated by President Kennedy in one of two cinemas that show an orientation film <U+2014> and a third shows a documentary on the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]]. They are then allowed to peruse the permanent exhibits on display, which include an exhibit on the [[US Space Program]] during [[Project Mercury]]; the Briefing Room is an exhibit on talks given to the public, at home and abroad; an exhibit on his [[United States presidential election, 1960|presidential campaign trail]]; a look at the Kennedy Family; a section dedicated to the First Lady, and partial replicas of the Kennedy [[Oval Office]] and his brother [[Robert F. Kennedy]]'s office as Attorney General at the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice Building]], which has been named for him. After viewing the exhibits the visitors will find themselves in under the glass pavilion. Other galleries display changing temporary exhibits.<ref name="jfkl.org-perm">{{cite web

===Oral-history project===
Begun in 1964, the oral-history project was a unique undertaking to document and preserve interviews with those associated with Kennedy. Initially expected to have about 150 participants<ref name="LewisMarch" />, today it contains over 1,100 interviews and continues to this day.<ref name="jfkl.org-oral-history">{{cite web

He said that although the emphasis would be on releasing everything as soon as possible, some items might remain closed for 10 to 25 years.<ref name="LewisJanuary" />

Because the interviewees are allowed to review their transcripts before the interviews are released for use by scholars, the audio may differ from the written record; so that the interviewing may disambiguate any misunderstanding in their speech and make it clear in a written form.<ref name="jfkl.org-oral-history" />

===Artifacts===
The library keeps a wide range of artifacts, many of which can be found in their respective exhibits. One of the more peculiar items is the original coconut on which the rescue message was inscribed by Kennedy to rescue the crew of the [[PT-109]] and delivered by natives of [[Biuku Gasa and Eroni Kumana]] of the [[Solomon Islands]].<ref name="jfkl.org-coconut">{{cite web
