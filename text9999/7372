'''''Tago Mago''''' is the third [[studio album]] by the German [[experimental rock]] band [[Can (band)|Can]], and was originally released as a [[double LP]] in 1971 by [[United Artists Records|United Artists]]. It was the band's second studio album to feature [[Damo Suzuki|Kenji "Damo" Suzuki]] after their previous vocalist, [[Malcolm Mooney]], quit the band in 1970 after having a [[nervous breakdown]]. The album was remastered and released as a [[Super Audio CD|SACD]] in September 2004, and included commentary from former ''[[Melody Maker]]'' journalist [[David Stubbs]] and [[Bobby Gillespie]] of [[Primal Scream]].

''Tago Mago'' has been described as Can's most extreme record in terms of sound and structure.<ref name="Secret History of Rock"/> The album has received much critical acclaim since its release and has been cited as an influence by various artists.

==Music==

[[Julian Cope]] wrote in ''[[Krautrocksampler]]'' that ''Tago Mago'' "sounds only like itself, like no-one before or after", and described the lyrics as delving "below into the Unconscious".<ref name="Cope 55" /> ''Tago Mago'' finds Can changing to a jazzier and more experimental sound than previous recordings, with longer instrumental interludes and less vocals; this shift was caused by the dramatic difference between Suzuki and the band's more dominant ex-singer Mooney.<ref name="Cope 56" /> On the album, Can took sonic inspiration from sources as diverse as [[jazz]] musicians such as [[Miles Davis]] and from [[electronic music|electronic]] [[avant-garde music]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Electronic and Computer Music |last=Manning |first=Peter D. |year=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press, Incorporated|isbn=0195170857|page=174}}</ref> The album was also inspired by the occultist [[Aleister Crowley]], which is reflected through the dark sound of the album as well as being named after [[Isla de Tagomago]], an island which features in the Crowley legend.<ref name="TOYM">{{cite book |title=Turn On Your Mind: Four Decades of Great Psychedelic Rock |last=DeRogatis |first=Jim |year=2003 |publisher=Hal Leonard|isbn=0634055488|page=273}}</ref> Czukay reflects that the album was "an attempt in achieving a mystery musical world from light to darkness and return".<ref name="Holger Czukay"/> The group has referred to the album as their "magic record".<ref name="TOYM"/> The tracks have been described as having an "air of mystery and forbidden secrets".<ref name="DeRogatis"/> ''Tago Mago'' is divided into two LPs, the first of which is more conventional and structured and the second more experimental and free-form.<ref>{{cite book|title=Alternative Rock: The Best Musicians and Recordings |last=Thompson |first=Dave |year=2000|publisher=Backbeat Books|isbn=0879306076|page=60}}</ref>

"Paperhouse", the opening track, is one of the shorter songs on the album. [[Allmusic]] critic [[Ned Raggett]] depicted the song as "beginning with a low-key chime and beat, before amping up into a rumbling roll in the midsection, then calming down again before one last blast."<ref name="Allmusic"/> "Mushroom" is the following track, which Leone noted as having a darker sound than the previous song. As [[Piero Scaruffi]] wrote, "Suzuki's [[psychodrama]] in Mushroom is set in a rarefied atmosphere of skitting drums, booming bass and atonal guitar."<ref name="Scaruffi">{{cite web |author=Scaruffi, Piero |title = Can | publisher =Piero Scaruffi | url = http://www.scaruffi.com/vol3/can.html | accessdate = 2008-04-04 }}</ref> "Oh Yeah" and "Halleluhwah" contain the elements that have been referred to as Can's "trademark" sound: "Damo Suzuki's vocals, which shift from soft mumbles to aggressive outbursts without warning; Jaki Liebezeit's mantric drumming; Holger Czukay's production manipulations (e.g. the backwards vocals and opening sound effects on 'Oh Yeah')."<ref name="Ground and Sky">{{cite web |author=McGlinchey, Joe |title = Tago Mago | publisher = Ground & Sky | url = http://www.progreviews.com/reviews/display.php?rev=can-tm | accessdate = 2008-04-04 }}</ref> Both "Oh Yeah" and "Halleluhwah" emphasize repetitive [[Groove (music)|grooves]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Unknown Legends of Rock 'n' Roll: Psychederic Unknowns, Mad Geniuses, Punk Pioneers, Lo-Fi Mavericks, and More |last=Unterberger |first=Ritchie |year=1998 |publisher=Backbeat Books|isbn=0879305347|page=170}}</ref>

The second LP features Can's more [[avant-garde]] efforts, with Roni Sarig, author of ''The Secret History of Rock'' calling it "as close as it ever got to avant-garde [[noise music]]."<ref name="Secret History of Rock">{{cite book |title=The Secret History of Rock: The Most Influential Bands You'Ve Never Heard |last=Sarig |first=Roni |year=1998 |publisher=Watson-Guptill Publications|isbn=0823076695|page=125}}</ref> Featuring Holger Czukay<U+2019>s tape and radio experiments, the tracks "Aumgn" and "Peking O" have led music critics to write that ''Tago Mago'' is Can's "most extreme record in terms of sound and structure."<ref name="Secret History of Rock"/> "Aumgn" features keyboardist [[Irmin Schmidt]] chanting rather than Suzuki's vocals.<ref name="Cope 56">Cope, p. 56</ref> The closing track, "Bring Me Coffee or Tea", was described by Raggett as a "coda to a landmark record."<ref name="Allmusic"/> Piero Scaruffi depicted it as "basically a delirious [[Hare Krishna|hare-krishna]] chant for loose rock [[quintet]], [pretending] to link the album to the contemporary fad of Eastern-tinged psychedelia."<ref name="Scaruffi"/>

''Tago Mago'' has been critically well-received and is credited with pioneering various modern musical styles. Raggett called ''Tago Mago'' a "rarity of the early '70s, a double album without a wasted note."<ref name="Allmusic">{{cite web |author=Raggett, Ned |title = Tago Mago | publisher = Allmusic Guide | url = {{Allmusic|class=album|id=r3217|pure_url=yes}} | accessdate = 2008-04-04 }}</ref> In the book ''Kraftwerk: Man, Machine and Music'', Pascal Bussy described the double LP as "hugely influential".<ref name="Kraftwerk: Man, Machine and Music">{{cite book |title=Kraftwerk: Man, Machine and Music |last=Bussy |first=Pascal  |year=2004 |publisher=SAF Publishing Ltd|isbn=0946719705|page=22}}</ref> The album is listed in the book ''[[1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die]]'' in which it stated, "Even after 30 years ''Tago Mago'' sounds refreshingly contemporary and gloriously extreme."<ref name="1001 Albums">{{cite book |title=1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die |last=Shade |first=Chris |year=2005 |publisher=Quintet Publishing Limited|isbn=978 0 7333 2120 7|page=235}}</ref> Many critics, particularly in the UK,<ref>{{cite book |title=Eurock: European Rock and the Second Culture |last=Thompson |first=Dave |year=2000 |publisher=Eurorock|isbn=0972309802|page=33}}</ref> were eager to praise the album, and by the end of 1971 Can played their first show in the UK.<ref name="Mute"/>

Various artists have cited ''Tago Mago'' as an influence on their work.  [[John Lydon]] of the [[Sex Pistols]] and [[Public Image Ltd.]] called it "stunning" in his biography, ''Rotten: No Irish, No Blacks, No Dogs''.<ref name="John Lydon">{{cite book |title=Rotten: No Irish, No Blacks, No Dogs |last=Lydon |first=John |year=1995 |publisher=Picador|isbn=031211883X |page=81}}</ref> [[Bobby Gillespie]] of [[Jesus and Mary Chain]] and [[Primal Scream]] said "The music was like nothing I'd ever heard before, not American, not rock & roll but mysterious and European."<ref>Gillespie, Bobby. "CAN - Tago Mago". ''CAN remastered - Tago Mago'' (CD liner notes). September 2004.</ref> [[Mark Hollis (English musician)|Mark Hollis]] of [[Talk Talk]] called ''Tago Mago'' "an extremely important album".<ref>Stubbs, David (February 1998). "Talking Liberties". ''Vox''.</ref> [[Jonny Greenwood]] and [[Thom Yorke]] of [[Radiohead]] cited it as an early influence.<ref name="Radiohead">{{cite book |title=OK Computer (33 1/3 series) |last=Griffiths |first=Dai |year=2004 |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|isbn=0826416632|pages=43<U+2013>44}}</ref>

There have been attempts by several artists to play [[cover version]]s of songs from ''Tago Mago''. The [[Flaming Lips]] album ''[[In a Priest Driven Ambulance]]'' contains a song called "Take Meta Mars", which was an attempt at covering the song "Mushroom". However, the band members had only heard the song once and didn't have a copy of it at the time, so the song is only similar-sounding and not a proper cover.<ref>[[Wayne Coyne|Coyne, Wayne]] (1990). Album notes for ''[[In a Priest Driven Ambulance]]'' by [[The Flaming Lips]], [CD booklet]. [[Restless Records]].</ref> The [[Jesus and Mary Chain]] have covered the song more faithfully to the original; it was performed live and included on the CD version of ''[[Barbed Wire Kisses]]''. British band [[The Fall (band)|The Fall]] recorded a song indebted to the ''Tago Mago'' track "Oh Yeah" entitled "I Am Damo Suzuki," named after the Can singer, on their seminal [[1985]] LP ''[[This Nation's Saving Grace]]''.

Remix versions of several ''Tago Mago'' tracks by various artists are included on the album ''[[Sacrilege (album)|Sacrilege]]''.
