'''The White Stripes''' are an [[United States|American]] [[alternative rock]] duo from [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], consisting of [[Jack White]] ([[songwriter|principal songwriter]], [[lead vocals|vocals]], [[guitar]], [[piano]]) and [[Meg White]] ([[drumkit|drums]], [[percussion]], [[backing vocals|vocals]]). The group rose to prominence as part of the [[garage rock revival]] with their successful albums ''[[White Blood Cells (album)|White Blood Cells]]'' and ''[[Elephant (album)|Elephant]]''. The White Stripes play [[lo-fi music]] stressing a simplicity of [[musical composition|composition]] and [[arrangements|arrangement]], mostly inspired by [[punk rock]], [[blues rock]]<ref name="amg">Handyside, Chris.

==Career==
===''The White Stripes'' and ''De Stijl''===
The White Stripes formed in a Detroit, Michigan suburb in 1997, first performing publicly on [[July 14]]. (See [[1997 in music]].)<ref name="amg"/> The duo began receiving more attention after Jack White's unceremonious exit from the Detroit garage-rock band [[The Go]] in 1999 after serving as their lead guitarist on their first album [[Whatcha Doin']]. Jack has described their eponymous debut album, ''[[The White Stripes (album)|The White Stripes]]'' (1999), as "really angry ... the most raw, the most powerful, and the most Detroit-sounding record we've made."<ref name=WSNET>Twitch (2006). [http://www.whitestripes.net/faq.php The Unofficial White Stripes FAQ Version 6] WhiteStripes.net (accessed [[September 26]], [[2006]])</ref>

Their second release, ''[[De Stijl (album)|De Stijl]]'' (2000), was named after the [[De Stijl]] (The Style) [[Netherlands|Dutch]] art movement, which they cited as a source for the approach to their musical image. De Stijl art is on the album cover. The work was recorded on an 8-track analog tape in Jack's living room; he subsequently said that he would never again employ that method because of the many interruptions which were encountered.

===''White Blood Cells'' and ''Elephant''===
The White Stripes enjoyed their first significant success during 2001 with the release of their first major label album ''[[White Blood Cells (album)|White Blood Cells]]'', initially released on [[Sympathy for the Record Industry]]; the album was re-released on [[V2 Records]] in 2002. The stripped-down [[garage rock]] sound drew critical acclaim in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], and in the United States soon afterward, making The White Stripes one of the more acclaimed bands of 2002.<ref name="amg"/> In 2002, [[Q (magazine)|''Q'' magazine]] named The White Stripes as one of "50 Bands to See Before You Die".<ref>[http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/qlistspage2.html#Die%E2%80%A6 50 Bands to See Before You Die]</ref>
The [[Lego]]-themed video, directed by [[Michel Gondry]], for the single "[[Fell in Love with a Girl]]" off ''[[White Blood Cells (album)|White Blood Cells]]'' brought them wider attention.

Their follow-up album ''[[Elephant (album)|Elephant]]'' (2003), was inspired by Alexander "the strings" Levi after being one of Jack's inspirations as a child. It was recorded with [[Liam Watson]] at [[Toe Rag Studios]], [[London]].  The album was released to widespread critical acclaim and even more commercial success, as it became The White Stripes' first UK chart-topper and US Top 10 album. The album's first single, "[[Seven Nation Army]]", was the band's most successful yet, and was followed with a cover of "[[I Just Don't Know What to Do with Myself]]", written by [[Burt Bacharach]]. The album's third single was the quite successful "[[The Hardest Button to Button]]". On [[February 8]], [[2004]], the album won a [[Grammy]] for [[Best Alternative Music Album]], while "Seven Nation Army" won a Grammy for [[Best Rock Song]].

In 2003, Jack and Meg White appeared in Jim Jarmusch's film ''[[Coffee and Cigarettes]]'' in a segment entitled "Jack Shows Meg His [[Tesla Coil]]". This particular segment contains extensions of White Stripes motifs such as childhood innocence and [[Nikola Tesla]]. In 2004, the band released its first music film ''[[Under Blackpool Lights]]'', which was filmed entirely using 16mm film and was directed by Dick Carruthers.

===''Get Behind Me Satan'' and other projects===
The group's, ''[[Get Behind Me Satan]]'', was recorded in Jack White's Detroit home and released in North America on [[June 7]], [[2005]] and has garnered critical acclaim. Three singles were released from the album, the first being "[[Blue Orchid]]", a popular song on satellite radio and some FM stations. White's new spouse appears in the video for the song, and the second single was "[[My Doorbell]]". The album won [[Best Alternative Music Album]] at the [[2006 Grammy Awards]]. They were also nominated for [[Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal]] for the song "My Doorbell".

The band released a cover version of [[Tegan and Sara]]'s song "[[Walking with a Ghost (song)|Walking with a Ghost]]" on [[iTunes]] on [[November 14]], [[2005]]. The song was later released on [[December 7]], [[2005]] as the ''[[Walking with a Ghost (EP)|Walking with a Ghost]]'' EP featuring four other live tracks.

The White Stripes postponed the [[Japan]]ese leg of their world tour after Jack strained his vocal cords, with doctors recommending that Jack not sing or talk for two weeks. After a full recovery, he returned to the stage in Auckland, New Zealand to headline the [[Big Day Out]] tour.<ref>BBC contributor (2006). [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4604842.stm "White Stripes cancel Japan dates"] BBC online (accessed [[October 4]], [[2006]])</ref>

[[The Raconteurs]], fronted by Jack White and [[Brendan Benson]], released their debut album ''[[Broken Boy Soldiers]]'' in May 2006. White went on to tour with the band through the rest of the year.

In October 2006, it was announced on the official White Stripes website that there would be an album of [[avant-garde]] orchestral recordings consisting of past music written by Jack White called ''[[Aluminium (album)|Aluminium]]''. The album was made available for pre-order on [[November 6]], [[2006]] to great demand from the band's fans; the LP version of the project sold out in a little under a day. The project was conceived by [[Richard Russell (XL Recordings)|Richard Russell]], founder of [[XL Recordings]], who co-produced the album with [[Joby Talbot]]. It was recorded between August 2005 and February 2006 at Intimate Studios in [[Wapping]], [[London]] using an [[orchestra]]. The album is available exclusively through the ''Aluminium'' website as a numbered limited edition of 3,333 CDs with 999 LPs also produced but now sold out. The download format will not be limited, and will come with an electronic booklet.<ref>(2006).

On [[January 12]], [[2007]], it was announced that in the process of reconstruction, [[V2 Records]] would no longer release new White Stripes material, leaving the band without a label.<ref>{{cite web

===''Icky Thump''===
On [[February 28]], [[2007]], in an online post spuriously attributed to "Kitayna Ireyna Tatanya Kerenska Alisof of the ''Moscow Bugle''" (a [[reference]] to ''[[Batman: The Movie]]''<ref>[http://www.methodsreporter.com/2007/03/01/white-stripes-icky-thump-batman-catwoman Strange new White Stripes<U+2019> Icky Thump/Batman connection - Chicago Methods Reporter<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>), the band announced that they had completed work on their studio album entitled ''Icky Thump''.  The album was recorded at [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]]'s Blackbird Studio and took almost three weeks to record <U+2014> the longest of any White Stripes album to date.  It would also be the first album with a title track. The album was released on [[June 16]] in Australia, [[June 18]] in New Zealand, the UK and Europe and [[June 19]], [[2007]] in the United States, Southeast Asia, and Japan.  The release came on the heels of a series of concerts in Europe and one in North America.<ref>[http://www.whitestripes.com/lo-fi/news.html News page, The White Stripes website news] (accessed [[April 10]], [[2007]])</ref><ref>[http://www.whitestripes.com/lo-fi/news.html News page, The White Stripes website show list] (accessed [[April 13]], [[2007]])</ref>.

Three tracks were previewed to ''[[NME]]'': "Icky Thump", "You Don't Know What Love Is (You Just Do As You're Told)" and "Conquest". ''NME'' described the tracks as "an experimental, heavy sounding 70's riff," "a strong, melodic love song" and "an unexpected mix of big guitars and a bold horn section,"
respectively.<ref>[http://www.nme.com/news/the-white-stripes/26791 Exclusive - NME.COM hears new White Stripes songs | News | NME.COM<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The first single from the album, the title track "[[Icky Thump (song)|Icky Thump]]", was made available online through the iTunes music stores in the United States and Canada on Thursday, [[April 26]], [[2007]], while it became available in the United Kingdom on [[June 4]]. On the US Billboard Charts dated [[May 12]], [[2007]], "Icky Thump" became the band's first top 40 single, charting at #26, and later charted at #2 in the UK charts.

On [[September 11]], [[2007]] the White Stripes announced the cancellation of 18 tour dates due to Meg's suffering from "acute [[Anxiety disorder|anxiety]]" problems.<ref>[http://www.whitestripes.com/news/news.html 9.11.07] WhiteStripes.com (accessed [[September 12]], [[2007]])</ref> Following this, on [[September 12]], [[2007]], a pornographic video surfaced that was rumored to be a sex tape featuring Meg White,<ref>www.tmz.com/2007/09/24/meg-on-alleged-sex-tape-i-think-i-smell-a-rat</ref> but this was subsequently denied.<ref>http://www.upi.com/NewsTrack/Entertainment/2007/09/25/rep_meg_white_sex_tape_is_a_fake_/5944/</ref><ref>http://www.antimusic.com/news/07/sep/26-12.shtml</ref> In an allegedly unrelated occurrence, that same day, the duo cancelled the remainder of their 2007 tour dates including their scheduled tour of the UK.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6993047.stm BBC NEWS | Entertainment | The White Stripes cancel UK tour<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Music==
===Instruments and equipment===
The White Stripes are famous for having only two musicians, limiting the instruments played live.<ref name=FM>Hickman, Christopher (2005). [http://www.flakmag.com/music/whitestripes.html The White Stripes - Get Behind Me Satan] FlakMag.com (accessed [[September 27]], [[2006]])</ref> Jack, the principal writer, has said this has not been a problem, and that he "always centered the band around the number three. Everything was vocals, guitar and drums or vocals, piano and drums."<ref name=WOW> Fricke, David (2005). [http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/7582742/white_on_white/ "White on White"] Rolling Stone (accessed [[May 6]], [[2006]])</ref> While Jack is the lead singer, Meg does sing lead vocals on five of the band's songs: "In the Cold, Cold Night" and "Well It's True That We Love One Another" (from [[Elephant (album)|''Elephant'']]),<ref name=NYT/> "Passive Manipulation" (from [[Get Behind Me Satan|''Get Behind Me Satan'']]), "Who's a Big Baby?" (released on the "[[Blue Orchid]]" single), and "St. Andrew  (This Battle is in the Air)" (from [[Icky Thump|''Icky Thump'']]).

Early on, the band drew attention for their preference for antiquated recording equipment. The album ''Elephant'' was recorded on an [[Multitrack recording|eight-track]] machine that dated from the early 1960s. With few exceptions, Jack White has shown a continued partiality towards amps and pedals from the 1960s. <ref name=RSB>Hoard, Christian (2004).

[[Image:Bigdayout whitestripes.jpg|thumb|300px|The White Stripes playing at the Big Day Out in Melbourne 2006]]
Jack uses a number of effects to create his sound, notably a Digitech [[whammy pedal]] to reach pitches that would otherwise not be possible with a regular guitar.<ref name=NYT>Ratliff, Ben (2003). [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C05E7DC133AF932A15757C0A9659C8B63 "Rock Review: Contradictory and Proud of It"]''[[The New York Times]]'' (accessed [[May 2]], [[2006]])</ref> For instance, without the pedal, "Seven Nation Army" would require a bass guitar<ref name=bb2/> and "Black Math" would be very difficult to play without a 29th [[fret]] (which does not exist on most guitars) on the highest string.<ref name=bb3>[http://www.brokenbricks.com/cgi-bin/tab.cgi?/tabs/Elephant/Black%20Math.txt ''Black Math'' tablature and notes]. ''Broken Bricks'' (accessed [[August 5]], [[2006]])</ref>

The guitars Jack White uses live are a 1964 [[JB Hutto Montgomery Airline]], a Harmony Rocket, a 1970s Crestwood Astral II, and a 1950s Kay Hollowbody. He has also been seen playing various [[Gretsch]]es including a White Penguin with The Raconteurs. In concert with the Digitech [[whammy pedal]], MXR Micro-Amp, Electro-Harmonix [[Big Muff Pi]] Distortion/[[Sustain]]er (now custom modified), and Electro-Harmonix POG (Polyphonic octave generator), White can produce a very distinctive sound. He also uses a Boss TU-2 tuner pedal. He plugs this setup into a 1970s [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]] Twin Reverb and two 100-Watt [[Sears, Roebuck and Company|Sears]] [[Silvertone (instruments)|Silvertone]] 6x10 combo amplifiers.<ref name=bb1>[http://www.brokenbricks.com/guitar.shtml "White Stripes Equipment/Technique"] ''Broken Bricks'' (accessed [[May 2]], [[2006]])</ref> In addition to the standard [[Guitar tuning|tuning for guitar]], Jack White uses also several [[open tuning]]s in many of his songs and also in covers by the band. White also uses a Digitech whammy pedal which creates among other things an octave lower to what is played on the guitar, which he uses most notably on the songs "[[Seven Nation Army]]" and "[[The Hardest Button to Button]]".<ref name=bb2>[http://www.brokenbricks.com/cgi-bin/tab.cgi?/tabs/Elephant/Seven%20Nation%20Army.txt "Seven Nation Army" tablature and notes]. ''Broken Bricks'' (accessed [[May 2]], [[2006]])</ref>

White also plays other instruments such as a black F-Style Gibson [[mandolin]], Rhodes bass keys, and a Steinway [[piano]]. He is currently using a Moog ''Little Phatty'' synthesizer. Jack plays a custom-made red and white [[marimba]] on "The Nurse", "Forever for Her (Is Over for Me)" as well as on the non-album tracks "Who's A Big Baby" and "Top Special". (This marimba was dumped over in Japan, at the last concert for the Get Behind Me Satan tour.)

===Recording sessions and live performances===
[[Image:Jack White WF.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Jack performing onstage (2005).]]
Several White Stripes recordings were made rather rapidly. For example, ''[[Elephant (album)|Elephant]]'' was recorded in about two weeks in London's Toerag Studio.<ref name="amg"/> Their 2005 follow-up, ''[[Get Behind Me Satan]]'', was likewise recorded in just two weeks. For live shows, the duo also never prepares [[set list]]s for their shows, believing that planning too
closely would ruin the spontaneity of their performances.<ref>Frampton, Scott (July 2007), [http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=afh&AN=25432724&loginpage=Login.asp&site=ehost-live "Jack & Meg White"]. ''Esquire''. '''148''' (1):p118-119</ref> Jack frequently improvises with solos and often cuts a song short to jump into another. Because of this, no two shows in the same venue are exactly alike, and show length time can vary from 70 to 100 minutes.

On [[April 25]], [[2007]], the duo announced that they would embark on a tour of Canada performing in all 10 provinces, plus the [[Yukon]], [[Nunavut]] and [[Northwest Territories]].
In the words of Jack White: <U+201C>Having never done a  tour of Canada, Meg and I thought it was high time to go whole hog. We want to take this tour to the far reaches of the Canadian landscape. From the ocean to the permafrost. The best way for us to do that is ensure that we perform in every province and territory in the country, from the Yukon to Prince Edward Island. Another special moment of this tour is the show which will occur in Glace Bay, Nova Scotia on [[July 14]], The White Stripes<U+2019> Tenth Anniversary.<U+201D> Canadian fiddler [[Ashley MacIsaac]] opened for the band at the Glace Bay show; earlier in 2007, MacIsaac and Jack White had discovered that they were distantly related. <ref name="macisaac">[http://www.cbc.ca/arts/music/story/2007/07/14/whitestripes-halifax-bar.html "Halifax fans chase White Stripes around town"], [[cbc.ca]], [[July 14]], [[2007]].</ref>

On [[June 24]], [[2007]], just a few hours before their concert at Deer Lake Park, The White Stripes kicked off their cross-Canada tour by playing a 40 minute set for a group of 30 kids at the Creekside Youth Centre in [[Burnaby, British Columbia|Burnaby]]. The Canadian tour was also marked by concerts in small markets such as [[Glace Bay, Nova Scotia|Glace Bay]], [[Whitehorse, Yukon|Whitehorse]] and [[Iqaluit]], as well as by frequent "secret shows" publicized mainly by posts on The Little Room, a White Stripes fan messageboard. Gigs included performances at a bowling alley in [[Saskatoon]], a youth center in Edmonton, Alberta,  a [[Winnipeg Transit]] bus and [[The Forks, Winnipeg, Manitoba|The Forks]] park in [[Winnipeg]], a park in Whitehorse, the [[YMCA]] in downtown [[Toronto]], the Arva Flour Mill in [[Arva, Ontario]], and Locas on Salter (a pool hall) in [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]], [[Nova Scotia]]. Video clips from several of the secret shows have been posted to [[YouTube]]. <ref>[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20070705.wstripes05/BNStory/Entertainment/home "Jack and Meg go back to school"], ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', [[July 5]], [[2007]].</ref>

===Shortest live show===
The White Stripes played their 'Shortest live show ever' on [[16 July]] [[2007]] on George Street, St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada. Jack played a single C# note accompanied by a bass drum/crash cymbal hit from Meg. At the end of the show, Jack announced, "We have now officially played in every province and territory in Canada." They then left the stage and performed a full show later that night in St John's.<ref>{{cite web| author =  | title =  And on that note, the White Stripes tour is over | url = http://www.cbc.ca/arts/story/2007/07/17/white-stripes.html | year = 2007 | accessdate = 2007-08-10 | publisher = cbc.ca }} </ref>

===Lyrics===
Interpersonal relationships, especially those between men and women, are the main theme of White Stripes song lyrics. Jack White does not write about politics, as a rule. However, "[[The Big Three Killed My Baby]]" could be considered as a political song as well, as the lyrics attack the [[automotive industry]]'s lack of vision and the fall of the major [[labor unions]] of the 1960s to 1980s in Detroit. Also, in the song "[[Icky Thump]]", he sings "White Americans, what? / Nothing better to do? / Why don't you kick yourself out / You're an immigrant, too." The song "The Union Forever" features lines from the [[Orson Welles]] film ''[[Citizen Kane]]''.<ref name=RSB/>

Many White Stripes songs refer to [[school]] and [[childhood]], namely "Sister, Do You Know My Name?", "[[We're Going to Be Friends]]", "I Think I Smell a Rat", "Suzy Lee", "Black Math", "[[The Hardest Button to Button]]" and "[[Passive Manipulation]]".

Curiously, all six studio albums feature songs with titles starting with the word "little". In order of album release, there is "Little People", "Little Bird", "Little Room", "Little Acorns", "Little Ghost" and "Little Cream Soda". Furthermore, on the intro to "Let's Build a Home", from the ''[[De Stijl (album)|De Stijl]]'' album, there is a recording of a song called "Little Red Box". Live they have covered Bacharach & David's "Little Red Book" made popular by the 1960s LA group Love. The song that Jack wrote for [[Loretta Lynn]]'s ''[[Van Lear Rose]]'' album is called "Little Red Shoes" and is timed at 3 minutes and 33 seconds, the number 3 being Jack's personal signature.

[[Jack White]] has a personal fascination with redheads and it shows up in his lyrics. Songs like "Fell in Love With a Girl", "[[Icky Thump]]", "Take, Take, Take" and "[[300 MPH Torrential Outpour Blues]]" all mention redheads or red hair. White has said in interviews that [[Rita Hayworth]] (a redhead) was his focal point during the recording of [[Get Behind Me Satan]] and he also happens to be married to [[Karen Elson]], an English supermodel famous for her red hair.

Another frequent theme in White Stripes songs is the idea of "home."  The lyrics for "Hotel Yorba," "Let's Build a Home," "The Hardest Button to Button" "A Martyr for my Love for You," "Rag and Bone," and "There's No Home for You Here," suggest the home in some way: building a home, moving from one home to another, or finding home for unwanted junk.

==Band motifs==

===Relationship===

Jack and Meg White have provided various descriptions of their relationship.  In many early interviews Jack claimed that he and Meg were [[siblings]],
<ref>[http://www.geocities.com/SunsetStrip/Studio/2040/0900jack.html "The White Stripes Jack White Talking"  
by Kurt Hernon, bangsheet.net</ref> 
a claim which was widely believed and repeated

yet they continued to insist publicly that they were brother and sister.  The couple had been divorced in 2000 just before the band gained widespread attention.<ref name="time"/>

In a 2005 interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine, Jack White claimed that this deception was intended to keep the focus on the music rather than the couples' relationship: 
<blockquote>
When you see a band that is two pieces, husband and wife, boyfriend and girlfriend, you think, "Oh, I see . . ." When they're brother and sister, you go, "Oh, that's interesting." You care more about the music, not the relationship -- whether they're trying to save their relationship by being in a band.
<ref>[http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/white_stripes_white_on_white/page] "White on White", ''Rolling Stone'', August 25, 2005</ref>
</blockquote>

===Color scheme===

[[Red]], [[white]] and [[black]], the band's signature colors, are, according to Jack, "the most powerful color combination of all time, from a [[Coca-Cola]] can to a [[Nazism|Nazi]] banner."  These colors permeate the duo's distinctive wardrobe and album artwork. In some interviews, the group has said that the colors red and white refer to peppermint candy, a symbol of childhood innocence. Jack has also mentioned that the colors are used in baby toys because they are easily visible to infants, who are slightly [[colorblind]] at birth. Besides the red, white and black that the band wears, Jack also said hats are "really important."<ref>[http://poponthepop.com/2007/07/25/quote-me-of-the-day-7/ Jack likes hats too]</ref>

Before forming the band, Jack had also created a three-color scheme for an upholstery business he started in his early twenties. All of his tools, his van, and his uniform used the colors white, black, and yellow. <ref>[http://www.believermag.com/issues/200305/?read=interview_white]</ref>

Song lyrics often include the band motif of colors mentioned in the above section. Song titles also sometimes feature these colors ("Black Math", "Red Rain", and "White Moon"). Incidentally, the album ''Icky Thump'' was recorded at Blackbird Studio in Nashville, TN. The title track from ''Icky Thump'' integrates all the trademark colors of the band into the song's lyrics and storyline: "redhead se<U+00F1>orita", "black rum" and "one white eye".

===The number three===
Jack has emphasized the significance that the number three holds for the band, citing it as inspiration not only for their tri-colored uniforms, but their pared-down approach to what he considers the three elements of song: storytelling, melody and rhythm.<ref name=FM/> The number three also frequently appears in White Stripes' album artwork, and texts written by Jack, such as liner notes or messages written on the band's website, are often signed with "Jack White III" or simply "III".  There are also only three sounds--drums, guitar and vocals--in most of their songs; sometimes keyboard or piano is substituted for guitar. Jack also only uses three electric guitars for the band's live concerts: a vintage 1960's-[[JB Hutto Montgomery Airline|Airline]], a 1950's Kay Hollowbody and a Crestwood Astrall II. Also notable is Jack's admiration for the [[Carol Reed]] film ''[[The Third Man]]'', which is similarly the name of his production company. Jack chose "Three Quid" as his nickname during the band's 2005 UK tour.
