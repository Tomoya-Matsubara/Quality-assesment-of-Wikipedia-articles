'''Clark State Forest''', located just north of [[Henryville, Indiana|Henryville]], [[Indiana]] in the [[United States]], is Indiana's oldest [[state forest]], formed in 1903 as a forest research facility and a [[nursery (horticulture)|nursery]] and later expanded by the [[Works Progress Administration]]. Originally 2,028&nbsp;acres (8&nbsp;km<U+00B2>) of total land area, it is now almost {{convert|24000|acre|km2|-1}} and is bisected by [[Interstate 65]]. It features three trails used exclusively for hikers trails: two internal [[trail]]s, and the {{convert|59|mi|km|sing=on}} [[Knobstone Trail]]. There are nine horse trails, and five miles (8&nbsp;km) of [[mountain bike]] trails. Two nature preserves are also situated within the park.  The park also contains a {{convert|100|yd|sing=on}} outdoor gun range.

==History==
A concern around the turn of the 20th century was that many [[woodworking]] facilities in [[Indiana]] would be forced to close due to dwindling timber supplies.  This wood was used by furniture makers and shipbuilders such as the [[Howard Shipyards]]. The timber industry was a major part of southern Indiana's agricultural income, but thousands of acres had been deforested. In response to the problem, the state of Indiana decided to establish a series of state forests to ensure the continued existence of timber for woodworking facilities, and to allow Indiana to maintain its ability to export [[hardwood]]. The [[Indiana General Assembly]] in&nbsp;1901 created the [[Indiana State Board of Forestry]].<ref name="Kleber 204" /><ref>{{Harvnb|Kramer|2007|p=265.}}</ref>

In May&nbsp;1903, the Indiana state government purchased {{convert|2028|acre|km2}} of forest in the north of [[Clark County, Indiana|Clark County]], noted for its knob features (isolated conical hills),<ref>{{Harvnb|Kleber|2001|p=486.}}</ref> for use as Indiana's first state forest, at a cost of [[US$]]16,000.<ref>{{Harvnb|Taylor|1989|p=181.}}</ref> Seedlings were planted at Clark State Forest, many of which were to be later moved to other parts of the state.  This practice allowed more productive use of the land within the forest, and facilitated the teaching of the art of forestry. [[Charles C. Deam]], a botanist who in&nbsp;1909 became Indiana's state forester, was in charge of making the state forest an experimental laboratory for 20th-century forest care.<ref name="Kleber 204"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Kramer|2007|p=265,266.}}</ref>  Between the opening of the forest, and&nbsp;1935, over&nbsp;150&nbsp;different tree types were tested, many of which survive yet.<ref name="in.gov">{{Citation | title = Clark State Forest | url = http://www.in.gov/dnr/forestry/6467.htm | publisher = IN.gov | accessdate = 2009-01-02}}</ref>

During the [[Great Depression]], the [[Works Progress Administration]] chose to make Clark State Forest a training center for the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]], and also made it Indiana's largest CCC cantonment in November&nbsp;1933. They created [[artificial lake]]s within Clark State Forest, and built many bridges, to aid in [[water conservation]], provide beauty spots within the forest, and teach forestry skills to members of the Civilian Conservation Corps. The state forest's proximity to the [[Jeffersonville Quartermaster Depot]] was key in the decision to focus so much attention on it.<ref name="Kleber 204">{{Harvnb|Kleber|2001|p=204.}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Kramer|2007|p=237.}}</ref>

==Features==
[[File:Clark SF Road.jpg|thumb|Entrance road to the forest]]
Having grown from its original {{convert|2028|acres|km2|0}}, Clark State Forest now covers {{convert|24000|acre|km2}}, with many roads and paths.  The area also includes {{convert|100|mi|km}} miles of horse trails, ranging from "easy" (for novice riders) to "rugged" (experienced riders only).  The existence of these horse trails is one reason why nearby [[Charlestown State Park]] did not include them in its development plans.  Hunting is allowed, except in those areas designated specifically for more popular recreational activities.  Species of wildlife of interest to hunters include [[deer]], [[fox]]es, [[ruffed grouse]], [[squirrel]]s, [[turkey]]s, [[raccoon]]s and [[woodcock]]s.  All the campsites are by design primitive, and the only other areas in the forest that are allowed for camping are {{convert|100|ft|m}} off the [[Knobstone Trail]]. Other recreational pursuits for visitors include hiking, biking, fishing and picnicking.  All of these human activities are however of secondary importance to the primary function of the state forest, which is timber management.<ref name="Kleber 204"/><ref name="in.gov"/>

Both native and non-native tree saplings are grown within the forest. Trees officially allowed to be sold for lumber within the state forest are between 70&nbsp;and&nbsp;100&nbsp;years old.  Often, the chosen trees are felled to provide an area for native [[deer]] to live in the open, and to give smaller animals a brush area for their subsistence.<ref name="Kleber 204"/> Included in some protected areas are the [[List of Quercus species|White Oak]] ({{convert|160|acre|km2|1|disp=/|abbr=on}}) and the [[Quercus prinus|Chestnut Oak]]/[[Virginia Pine]] (20&nbsp;acres) Nature Preserves.<ref name="in.gov"/>  Other species of tree include [[black oak]]{{Disambiguation needed|date=June 2011}}, [[black walnut]], [[pignut hickory]], [[sugar maple]]s, and [[tulip tree]]s.<ref>{{Citation | title = Forest Resource Trail | url = http://www.in.gov/dnr/forestry/6566.htm | publisher = IN.gov | accessdate = 2009-01-02 }}</ref>  North of the Schlamm Lake is a [[fish hatchery]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Keller|1986|p=66.}}</ref>
