'''John Sidney McCain III ''' retired from the [[United States Navy]] in April 1981. His last four years in the service had been spent as the Navy's liaison to the [[United States Senate]]. He moved to [[Arizona]] with his new wife and, aided by a job from his father-in-law and the contacts it gave him, soon began a new career in politics.

In 1982, he was elected as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] to the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] from [[Arizona's 1st congressional district]]. After serving two terms there and making an impression as a rising political figure, he was elected U.S. Senator from Arizona in 1986. He became one of the senators entangled in the [[Keating Five]] scandal of the late 1980s, but survived it and was re-elected in 1992 and 1998.

While generally adhering to [[American conservatism]], McCain established a reputation as a political maverick for his willingness to defy Republican orthodoxy on several issues. In reaction to his Keating Five experience, he made [[campaign finance reform]] one of his signature concerns. He was also a leader in normalizing diplomatic relations with [[Vietnam]]. His national visibility as a senator gave him the basis to begin a campaign for the 2000 Republican nomination for [[President of the United States]].

McCain's original plan had been to run for a new U.S. House of Representatives seat from Arizona, created by [[United States congressional apportionment|reapportionment]] following the [[United States Census, 1980|1980 census]], but that turned out to be too far from Phoenix.<ref name="timberg-140">Timberg, ''An American Odyssey'', pp. 137<U+2013>140.</ref>  Then [[John Jacob Rhodes, Jr.]], the longtime Republican congressman from [[Arizona's 1st congressional district]], announced his retirement in January 1982.<ref name="az-arizona"/>  This seat encompassed parts of the [[Phoenix metropolitan area]] and was very close to where the McCains lived; his wife [[Cindy McCain]] bought a house in the district the same day as Rhodes' announcement.<ref name="timberg-140"/>  Rhodes suggested that McCain first run for the [[Arizona Legislature]] to gain more experience, but McCain had no interest in slowly working his way up.<ref name="wapo101308">{{cite news | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/12/AR2008101202306.html | title=Seeing White House From a Cell in Hanoi | author=Leahy, Michael | publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]'' | date=2008-10-13 | accessdate=2008-10-17}}</ref>

===Keating Five scandal===
John McCain's upward political trajectory was jolted when he became enmeshed in the [[Keating Five]] scandal, a highly visible part of the [[Savings and Loan crisis]] of the 1980s. [[Charles Keating Jr.]]'s [[Lincoln Savings and Loan Association]], a subsidiary of his [[American Continental Corporation]], was insolvent as a result of some bad loans. In order to overcome its debt, Lincoln violated "direct investment" rules by directing accounts by the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] into commercial real estate ventures.<ref name="nyt-who">{{cite news | url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE4D91230F931A15752C1A96F948260 | title=The Lincoln Savings and Loan Investigation: Who Is Involved | publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' | date=1989-11-22}}</ref>  This caught the eye of federal regulators, who were looking to shut Lincoln down.<ref name="az-keating"/>  Keating contacted five senators to whom he made contributions, looking for them to intervene with the regulators on his behalf. 

McCain and Keating had become personal friends following their initial contacts in 1981.<ref name="alex-k5-1"/>  Between 1982 and 1987, McCain had received $112,000 in lawful<ref name="nyt-sen-eth"/> political contributions from Keating and his associates.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.reason.com/news/show/35983.html | title=How John McCain Reformed | author=Sullum, Jacob | publisher=''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]'' | date=2005-03-11 | authorlink=Jacob Sullum}}</ref>  In addition, McCain's wife Cindy and her father [[Jim Hensley]] had invested $359,100 in a Keating shopping center in April 1986, a year before McCain met with the regulators. McCain, his family, and their baby-sitter had made nine trips at Keating's expense, sometimes aboard the American Continental jet.

By March 1987, Keating was asking McCain to travel to meet with regulators regarding Lincoln Savings; McCain refused.<ref name="alex-k5-1">Alexander, ''Man of the People'', pp. 108<U+2013>111.</ref>  Keating called McCain a "wimp" behind his back, and on March 24 the two had a heated, contentious meeting.<ref name="alex-k5-1"/>  On April 2 and April 9, 1987, McCain and the other senators met at the Capitol with regulators, first with [[Edwin J. Gray]], chairman of the [[Federal Home Loan Bank Board]], and then members of the FHLBB San Francisco branch, to discuss the government's investigation of Lincoln.<ref name="alex-k5-1"/>  McCain would write in 2002 that attending the two meetings was "the worst mistake of my life".<ref>McCain and Salter, ''Worth the Fighting For'', p. 161.

McCain was a key member of the 1991<U+2013>1993 [[Senate Select Committee on POW/MIA Affairs]], chaired by Democrat and fellow Vietnam War veteran [[John Kerry]], which was convened to investigate the [[Vietnam War POW/MIA issue]]: the fate of U.S. service personnel listed as [[missing in action]] during the Vietnam War.

[[Image:McCainPortrait.jpeg|thumb|upright|right|Another official Senate photo]]
In 1997, McCain became chairman of the powerful [[United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation|Senate Commerce Committee]]; he was criticized for accepting funds from corporations and businesses under the committee's purview,<ref name="az-maverick"/> but responded by saying that, "Literally every business in America falls under the Commerce Committee" and that he restricted those contributions to $1,000 and thus was not part of the big-money nature of the campaign finance problem.<ref name="az-maverick"/>  In that year, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine named McCain as one of the "25 Most Influential People in America".<ref>{{cite book | last=Utter | first=Glenn H. | coauthors=Strickland, Ruth Ann | title=Campaign and Election Reform | edition=2nd | publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]] | year=2008 | isbn=159884069X}} p. 177.</ref>  McCain used his chairmanship to challenge the [[tobacco industry]] in 1998, proposing legislation that would increase cigarette taxes in order to fund anti-smoking campaigns and reduce the number of teenage smokers, increase research money on health studies, and help states pay for smoking-related health care costs.<ref name="az-maverick"/><ref name="alex-184">Alexander, ''Man of the People'', pp. 184<U+2013>187.</ref>  The industry spent some $40<U+2013>50&nbsp;million in national advertising in response;<ref name="az-maverick"/><ref name="alex-184"/> while McCain's bill had the support of the [[Clinton administration]] and many public health groups, most Republican senators opposed it, stating it would create an unwieldy new bureaucracy.<ref name="alex-184"/> The bill failed to gain [[cloture]] twice<ref name="alex-184"/> and was seen as a bad political defeat for McCain.<ref name="alex-184"/>  During 1998 a revised version of the [[McCain-Feingold Act]] came up for Senate consideration; in addition to banning soft money, it sought to restrict "[[issue ad]]s" run by independent groups within 60 days of an election.<ref name="aap-08-96">Barone and Cohen, ''Almanac of American Politics'' 2008, p. 96.</ref> While having majority support, it was fiercely opposed by Senator [[Mitch McConnell]] on free speech and partisan threat grounds, and it again fell victim to a filibuster and failed to gain cloture.<ref name="m-b"/><ref name="aap-08-96"/>

McCain easily won re-election to a third senate term in November 1998, gaining 69&nbsp;percent of the vote to 27&nbsp;percent for his Democratic opponent, environmental lawyer [[Ed Ranger]].<ref name="az-maverick"/>  Ranger was a motorcycle enthusiast whose [[Harley-Davidson]] was painted as the [[flag of Arizona]]<ref name="alex-187">Alexander, ''Man of the People'', p. 187.</ref> and a political novice who had only recently returned from four years of working and living in [[Mexico]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D04E3D61F3FF936A35752C1A96E958260 |title=The 1998 Elections: State by State <U+2014> West: Arizona |author=Lewin, Tamar |publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' |date=1998-11-05 |accessdate=2007-12-21}}</ref>  McCain carried Democratic stronghold [[Apache County, Arizona|Apache County]] by 54<U+2013>42&nbsp;percent and won Hispanic votes statewide by 52<U+2013>42&nbsp;percent.<ref>Barone and Cohen, ''Almanac of American Politics'' 2008, p. 100.</ref>  McCain took no "soft money" during the campaign, but still raised $4.4 million for his bid, saying that he had needed it in case the tobacco companies or other Washington special interests mounted a strong effort against him.<ref name="az-maverick"/>  One of Ranger's campaigning points had been that McCain was really more interested in running for president;<ref name="az-maverick"/> McCain indeed created a presidential [[exploratory committee]] the following month.<ref name="alex-187"/>

McCain had been uncomfortable and largely silent during the 1998 [[Lewinsky scandal]], partly because his own personal life had not been without blemishes, and partly because his upcoming presidential nomination run restricted his political options.<ref name="timberg-imp">Timberg, ''An American Odyssey'', pp. 194<U+2013>195.</ref>  During the early 1999 [[Impeachment of Bill Clinton]], McCain voted to convict the president on both the [[perjury]] and [[obstruction of justice]] counts.<ref name="timberg-imp"/>  In his remarks on the Senate floor, McCain said: "Although I may admit to failures in my private life, I have [always] kept faith with every oath I have ever sworn to this country. I have known some men who kept that faith at the cost of their lives. I cannot <U+2014> not in deference to public opinion, or for political considerations, or for the sake of comity and friendship <U+2014> I cannot agree to expect less from the President."<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.arabamericannews.com/news/index.php?mod=article&cat=USA&article=689 | title=Holding McCain to his own standard | author=John Nichols | publisher=''[[The Arab American News]]'' | date=2008-02-23 | accessdate=2008-03-21}}</ref>

During 1999, the [[McCain-Feingold Act]] once again came up for consideration, this time with soft money prohibition features in but the issue ads provision out.<ref name="aap-08-96"/>  McConnell challenged McCain to name specific senators who had been corrupted by existing campaign finance practices, but McCain refused.<ref name="aap-08-96"/>  In the end, the same failure to gain cloture befell the legislation again.<ref name="m-b"/>  During that year, McCain shared the [[Profile in Courage Award]] with Feingold for their work in trying to enact this [[campaign finance reform]]; McCain was cited for opposing his own party on the bill at a time when he was trying to win the party's presidential nomination.<ref name="jfk-award">{{cite press release |url=http://www.jfklibrary.org/Education+and+Public+Programs/Profile+in+Courage+Award/Award+Recipients/John+McCain/Award+Announcement.htm |title=U.S. Senators John McCain and Russell Feingold Share 10th John F.
