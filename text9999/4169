'''Philip-Jon Haarsma''' ({{pron-en|harzma:}}), more commonly known as '''PJ Haarsma''', is a [[Canada|Canadian]] born [[science fiction]] author best known for his creation of the ''Rings of Orbis'' [[Fictional universe|universe]], which encompasses ''[[The Softwire]]'' series of books. Haarsma created a free, online [[role-playing game]], also called the ''Rings of Orbis'', set in the same universe. Both the book-series and the game target young, often reluctant readers in an attempt to encourage them by rewarding them for reading.<ref name="nyt">{{cite news

Haarsma developed a school presentation program in which he discusses  ''[[The Softwire]]'' books, [[astronomy]], and other [[science fiction]] and [[science fact]] topics. He is also one of the co-founders of The Kids Need to Read Foundation, an United States Internal Revenue Code [[501(c)(3)]] tax exempt public charity that purchases books to donate to underfunded schools and libraries.

==Personal life==
Philip-Jon Haarsma was born on June 5, 1964, in [[Georgetown, Ontario]]. Though he was named after his grandfathers, Philip and Jon, he went simply by "Jon" while growing up. Later, while attending [[McMaster University]] in [[Hamilton, Ontario]], where he received a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree, he began to use his initials, "PJ", and his books are published under the name "PJ Haarsma".

After he moved to the United States in 1989, Haarsma worked as a fashion and commercial photographer in [[New York City]] and [[Miami]]. He received many photography awards, including an honorable mention at the [[Cannes Lion Awards]] in 1996. Haarsma owned a small production company called Redbear Films, Inc. The company produced one movie (''Devious Beings'', 2002) and several corporate ads for clients such as [[Hewlett Packard]] and [[Nokia]]. For 15 years, Redbear Films focused on the production of  advertisements.<ref>{{cite web

To Haarsma, it felt similar to what the children of his books might feel as slaves. In addition to these experiences, there is a more prominent influence on the premise of ''The Softwire''<U+2014>that is, there is a mystery of a journey to a new, unknown place to start a new life. Growing up, Haarsma dreamed himself of moving to the [[United States]]; and in his twenties, he actually did. While there, living in [[New York City|New York]], [[Miami]], [[San Francisco]] and [[Los Angeles]], Haarsma  witnessed [[immigrant]]s struggling to get by. He tried to imagine what caused them to risk everything, and to move to another country, and to have a chance at something better. It is ''this journey'' (and struggle) that is prevalent in ''[[The Softwire]]''.<ref name="radio new zealand">{{cite web |url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/__data/assets/audio_item/0011/1790426/ngts-20081121-2010-Video_games_as_literature_bait-m048.asx

In ''The Softwire'', a group of human children are orphaned in outer space.  They are forced into [[indentured servitude]] on the Rings of Orbis, four planet-like rings around a [[wormhole]]. They must spend four years as slaves or ''knudniks'' before they are eligible to become Citizens. Each year they are the property of a new owner on a separate ring: ''Orbis 1, Orbis 2, Orbis 3, and Orbis 4''. They are forced into labor to do whatever task their new owner requires.

When the children arrive, they soon discover that thirteen-year-old Johnny Turnbull (JT), is the first human ''softwire'', a boy who has the ability to enter any computer with just his mind. To the older Citizens, a slave who can enter at will the massive computer which controls the Rings of Orbis makes JT very valuable and drives the Rings to the brink of war. As the central computer begins to malfunction, the Citizens connive, conspire, and even kill to own JT and his sister.

While there are other humans besides the children on the Rings, the majority of the inhabitants are of alien species. ''The Keepers'' are an intelligent species of two-headed beings who act as the overseers. Other species encountered include ''Belarans'', ''Choi'', ''Solinns'', and ''Trefaldoors'', all of which become interesting roles for young players to choose from in the game,''Rings of Orbis''.<ref>

The game works to encourage reluctant readers, especially boys, by giving them an interactive game through which to relate to the mysteries found within the books themselves.

==Promotion of literacy==

===Kids Need to Read===
[[Image:KNTR-Founders2008.gif|thumb|left|KNTR founders Fillion and Haarsma]]While speaking at schools across the United States, Haarsma noticed how some school librarians were having trouble finding funds to purchase ''The Softwire'' books after a demand had been created by Haarsma's visit. Many of the librarians were struggling to fill their shelves with books.  In June 2007, Haarsma and a friend, actor [[Nathan Fillion]], approached a group of Fillion's fans with the idea for a project that would work to purchase books for underfunded schools, as well as [[nonprofit]] institutions which gave books directly to children. The  group took to the idea and focused their energies into getting the project off the ground.  The Kids Need to Read project went public in August 2007.<ref name="Fillion interviews Haarsma">{{cite web

In January 2008, the process to transform the project into a legal foundation began, and the fan group was separated from the developing organization.  On May 22, 2008,  The Kids Need to Read Foundation (KNTR)<ref>{{cite web

KNTR became an Internal Revenue Code [[501(c)(3)]] [[tax exempt]] [[public charity]] on September 18, 2008, with a retroactive exemption date of May 22, 2008.  The organization is supported by a global volunteer base.

Funds were initially raised through [[ebay|eBay auctions]] of ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'' and ''[[Serenity (film)|Serenity]]'' autographed memorabilia, and ''The Softwire'' books and items, and other science fiction and [[literary]] themed items.<ref name="big damn zine">{{cite journal

Although the foundation separated from its fan beginnings, many [[science fiction]] fan organizations remain supportive.

During his presentation, Haarsma involves the children in various interactive activities.  These  include a [[Hollywood]]-style acting [[audition]], an [[alien]] [[ghost story]], and a demonstration of the vast distances in space.  The activities are designed to engage the children's imaginations and to make them feel a part of the presentation.

The responses to his visits from both students and teachers are positive. The majority of the feedback involves praise and thanks.  Haarsma has received many stories of previously reluctant readers being observed reading ''The Softwire'' books during school [[recess (break)|recess]].{{Quote|The author visit by PJ Haarsma was a lot of fun.
