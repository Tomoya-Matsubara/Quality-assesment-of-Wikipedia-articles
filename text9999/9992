== View on Zionism ==
In the preface of'' 'Zionism and the Palestinians' ''(1979) Flapan writes: 
<blockquote>To dispel misunderstanding, I want to make it clear that my belief in the moral justification and historical necessity of Zionism remains unaffected by my critical reappraisal of the Zionist leadership. The history of Zionism demonstrates the extent to which the urge to create a new society, embodying the universal values of democracy and social justice, was inherent in the Zionist movement and responsible for its progress in adverse conditions. Israel's problem today lies in the disintegration of these values, due largely to the intoxication with military success and the belief that military superiority is a substitute for peace. Unless the liberal and progressive values of Zionism are restored and Palestinian rights to self-determination within a framework of peaceful coexistence are recognised, Israel's search for peace is doomed to failure. I firmly believe that these trends will ultimately become the deciding force in Israel.<ref>Flapan, Simha, 1979, 'Zionism and the Palestinians', Croom Helm London, ISBN 0-85664-499-4, p.13-14</ref></blockquote>
