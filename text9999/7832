The '''Hudson Valley Rail Trail''' is a [[Road surface|paved]] {{convert|4|mi|km|adj=on}} east<U+2013>west [[rail trail]] in the [[Lloyd, New York|town of Lloyd]] in [[Ulster County, New York|Ulster County]], [[New York]], stretching from the [[Poughkeepsie Bridge]] through the [[Highland, Ulster County, New York|hamlet of Highland]]. Operated by a variety of railroads, the rail [[Transport corridor|corridor]] formed the western portion of the [[Poughkeepsie Bridge Route]]. It eventually became part of [[Consolidated Rail Corporation|Conrail]], which discontinued rail traffic along the corridor and sold it in 1984 to a convicted felon. The land was seized by Ulster County in 1991 and converted to a trail by 1997. The trail was extended east to the Poughkeepsie Bridge in 2010. It intersects [[U.S. Route 9W|US&nbsp;9W]], as well as Route&nbsp;[[U.S. Route 44 in New York|44]]/[[New York State Route 55|55]] and is expected to be extended west, where it will intersect [[New York State Route 299|NY&nbsp;299]].

The land comprising the Hudson Valley Rail Trail is part of a former rail [[Transport corridor|corridor]] comprising the [[Poughkeepsie Bridge Route]]. It ran east through the [[Highland, Ulster County, New York|hamlet of Highland]] in the [[Lloyd, New York|town of Lloyd]] over the [[Hudson River]] via the [[Poughkeepsie Bridge]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.dailyfreeman.com/articles/2003/07/13/top%20stories/9708023.txt |title=Troubled waters: Supporters of walkway over river can't agree on funding |date=2003-07-13 |accessdate=2011-01-10 |first=Hallie |last=Arnold |newspaper=[[Daily Freeman]] |location=Kingston, NY |publisher=[[Journal Register Company]]}}</ref> The corridor was, throughout its history, operated by the [[Central New England Railway|Central New England]], [[Reading Company|Philadelphia and Reading]],<ref>{{Cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=KIkHuzvZTGYC |title=The Hudson River Guidebook |first=Arthur G. |last=Adams |page=213 |publisher=[[Fordham University Press]] |location=Ramsey, NJ |edition=2nd |year=1996 |isbn=978-0823216796}}</ref> [[New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad|New Haven]], [[Erie Railroad|Erie]], [[New York, Ontario and Western Railway|Ontario and Western]], [[Lehigh and New England Railroad|Lehigh and New England]] and [[Penn Central Transportation Company|Penn Central]] railroads.

Parcels of the right-of-way between Lloyd and the neighboring [[New Paltz, New York|town of New Paltz]] were sold off by the county shortly before ownership of the remaining corridor was transfered to Lloyd and converted to a [[rail trail]].<ref name="rotary">{{Cite journal |url=http://www.hudsonvalleyrailtrail.net/downloads/hvrt_newsletter_fall_2009.pdf |title=Highland Rotary<U+2019>s Major Role In The Rail Trail |journal=Signals |publisher=Hudson Valley Rail Trail Association |location=Highland, NY |volume=6 |issue=3 |format=PDF |date=2009-08-11 |accessdate=2011-01-10 |page=3 |first=Rafael |last=D<U+00ED>az}}</ref><ref name="mabee-264" /> Roughly $400,000 in funding to convert the corridor to a trail was acquired through an [[easement]] between the town of Lloyd and a [[Broadband Internet access|broadband utility]] for the laying of [[Optical fiber|fiber optic]] cable,<ref name="D<U+00ED>az">{{Cite journal |url=http://www.hudsonvalleyrailtrail.net/downloads/hvrt_newsletter_spring_2010.pdf |title=Eastward Expansion Is Ahead of Schedule |journal=Signals |publisher=Hudson Valley Rail Trail Association |location=Highland, NY |volume=7 |issue=2 |format=PDF |date=2010-05-21 |accessdate=2011-01-10 |page=3 |first=Rafael |last=D<U+00ED>az}}</ref> though only $70,000 was needed to [[Road surface|pave]] the trail.
