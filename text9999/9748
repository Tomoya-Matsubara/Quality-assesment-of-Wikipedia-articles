The '''Place des Vosges''' is the oldest planned square in [[Paris]]. 
It is located in the ''[[le Marais|Marais]]'' district, and it straddles the dividing-line between the [[IIIe arrondissement|3rd]] and [[IVe arrondissement|4th]] [[Arrondissements of Paris|arrondissements]] of Paris.

== History ==
Originally known as the ''Place Royale'', the Place des Vosges was built by [[Henry IV of France|Henri IV]] from 1605 to 1612. A true square (140 m x 140 m), it embodied the first European program of royal city planning. It was built on the site of the H<U+00F4>tel des Tournelles and its gardens: at a tournament at the Tournelles, a royal residence, [[Henry II of France|Henri II]] was wounded and died. Catherine de Medicis had the Gothic pile demolished, and she removed to the Louvre.

The Place des Vosges, inaugurated in 1612 with a grand ''[[carrousel]]'' to celebrate the wedding of [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]] and [[Anne of Austria]], is the prototype of all the residential squares of European cities that were to come. What was new about the ''Place Royale'' in 1612 was that the housefronts were all built to the same design, probably by [[Baptiste du Cerceau]],<ref>Other architects, like [[Louis M<U+00E9>tezeau]], were responsible for the constructions erected behind these regular fa<U+00E7>ades.</ref> of red brick with strips of stone quoins over vaulted arcades that stand on square pillars. The steeply-pitched blue slate roofs are pierced with discreet small-paned dormers above the pedimented dormers that stand upon the cornices. Only the north range was built with the vaulted ceilings that the "galleries" were meant to have. Two pavilions that rise higher than the unified roofline of the square center the north and south faces and offer access to the square through triple arches. Though they are designated the Pavilion of the King and of the Queen, no royal personage has ever lived in the aristocratic square. The Place des Vosges initiated subsequent developments of Paris that created a suitable urban background for the French aristocracy.

Before the square was completed, Henri IV ordered the [[<U+00CE>le de la Cit<U+00E9>#The Place Dauphine|Place Dauphine]] to be laid out. Within a mere five-year period the king oversaw an unmatched building scheme for the ravaged medieval city: additions to the [[Louvre]], the [[Pont Neuf]], and the H<U+00F4>pital Saint Louis as well as the two royal squares.

Cardinal Richelieu had an equestrian bronze of [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]] erected in the center (there were no garden plots until 1680). The original was melted down in the Revolution; the present version, begun in 1818 by [[Louis Dupaty]] and completed by [[Jean-Pierre Cortot]], replaced it in 1825. The square was renamed in 1799 when the ''[[d<U+00E9>partement in France|d<U+00E9>partement]]'' of the [[Vosges]] became the first to pay taxes supporting a campaign of the [[French Revolution|Revolutionary army]]. The [[Bourbon Dynasty, Restored|Restoration]] returned the old royal name, but the short-lived [[French Second Republic|Second Republic]] restored the revolutionary one in 1848.

Today the square is planted with a [[bosquet]] of mature [[Tilia|linden]]s set in grass and gravel, surrounded by clipped lindens.
