Greece participated in and won the Eurovision Song Contest 2005, its first [[Eurovision Song Contest]] victory. Greek national broadcaster [[Ellinik<U+00ED> Radiofon<U+00ED>a Tile<U+00F3>rasi]] (ERT) internally selected [[Elena Paparizou|Helena Paparizou]] who sang "[[My Number One]]" in [[Kiev]], winning the competition with 230 points. The song is written by [[Christos Dantis]] and [[Natalia Germanou]], and composed by Christos Dantis. "My Number One" was selected through a national final on March 2, 2005, where the public and a professional jury chose it over three other candidate songs.

==Background==
{{main|Greece in the Eurovision Song Contest}}
The Eurovision Song Contest 2005 marked Greece's twenty-sixth entry in the Eurovision Song Contest since its debut in 1974.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=290|title=Eurovision Song Contest 1974 |publisher=www.eurovision.tv|accessdate=2009-01-17|last=|first=}}</ref> Prior to the contest, its best result was third place which was achieved twice: in 2001 with the song "[[Die for You (Antique song)|Die for You]]" performed by the duo [[Antique (duo)|Antique]] and in 2004 with "[[Shake It (Sakis Rouvas song)|Shake It]]" performed by [[Sakis Rouvas]]. Greece's least successful result was in 1998 when it placed twentieth with the song "[[Mia Krifi Evesthisia]]" by [[Thalassa]], receiving only twelve points in total, all from Cyprus.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-country/country?country=19 |title=History by Country: Greece|publisher=''[[European Broadcasting Union]]''|accessdate=2009-01-06}}</ref>

The Greek national broadcaster, [[Ellinik<U+00ED> Radiofon<U+00ED>a Tile<U+00F3>rasi]] (ERT) broadcasts the event in Greece each year and organizes the selection process for its entry.<ref>Paravantes, Maria. (2005-06-11). Joy In Greece Over Eurovision Win. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' 117(24), 17-17. Retrieved on 2009-01-16.</ref> Its selection techniques have varied from national finals where the public selects the entry, to internal selections like used in 2004, where the broadcaster has complete control over the selection. For the Eurovision Song Contest 2005, ERT decided to hold a televised national final after internally selecting an artist.

==Performer==
[[File:Antique Paparizou Panagiotidis.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Elena Paparizou who previously represented Greece as [[Antique (duo)|Antique]] ''(pictured)'' in the 2001 contest, was ultimately selected as the 2005 entrant.]]
Throughout the months preceding the national selection, rumors flooded Eurovision news websites about which artist would be representing Greece in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2005]]. There was an internal selection for the artist, being chosen by the broadcaster, while there would be a national final for the song, with the public having a say in the choice. 

The first artist given an official proposal to represent Greece in the 2005 contest was [[Sakis Rouvas]], the Greek entrant in the 2004 contest. During a press conference on 15 June 2004 discussing plans for the 50th contest, the network announced that they would like to have him represent them again if he liked.<ref name="rouvas 2005">{{cite web|url=http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/2867
|title=ERT asked Sakis Rouvas again!|date=15 June 2004|publisher=ESCToday|accessdate=20 March 2012}}</ref> ERT was expecting an answer by mid-July but Rouvas' response did not come until the 22nd of the month. He considered it, but ultimately felt that another artist should receive the opportunity. ESCToday mentioned that Rouvas' "decision is expected to sadden Greek fans, who generally supported the idea of him competing again."<ref name="rouvas says no">{{cite web|url=http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/2988|title=Rouvas declines singing for Greece in 2005|date=22 July 2005|publisher=ESCToday|accessdate=20 March 2012}}</ref> ERT would continue to ask Rouvas to represent them every year until he finally accepted again in 2009.<ref name="Aziz">''Aziz Night Show''. [[TV2 (Bulgaria)|TV2]]. Airdate: 8 April 2009</ref>
Meanwhile, in June 2004, [[Anna Vissi]] stated that she "would go to Eurovision if she was asked to".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oikotimes.com/ |title=Anna Vissi said that would go to Eurovision if she is asked to|date=2004-06-04|publisher=''Oikotimes''|accessdate=2008-09-23 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20040606000223/http://www.oikotimes.com/ |archivedate = 2004-06-06}}</ref> The network kept the internal format, seeking high profile acts. A few months later on November 27, 2004, it was reported that [[Despina Vandi]] was "ready to sign the necessary contracts" though nothing was officially announced by ERT.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://esctoday.com/news/read/3401|title=Oikotimes.com: Despina Vandi for Greece!|last=Bakker|first=Sietse|date=2004-11-27|publisher=''ESCToday''|accessdate=2008-09-23}}</ref> The rumored contract, brokered between Vandi's record label [[Heaven Music]] and ERT would have included a term that required all of Vandi's songs to be written by popular Greek songwriter [[Phoebus (composer)|Phoebus]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oikotimes.com/ |title=Despina Vandi Will Represent Greece in 2005|date=2004-11-27|publisher=''Oikotimes''|accessdate=2008-09-23 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20041127020807/http://www.oikotimes.com/ |archivedate = 2004-11-27}}</ref> The next day, November 28, 2004, ERT's Eurovision spokeswoman [[Daphne Bokota]] stated that Despina Vandi and ERT were close to a deal, but had concluded that she was too expensive to send to the contest. She also said that Vandi was worried about participating in the Eurovision Song Contest while her international career was going well. "Here at ERT, we don't understand [why] Greek artists are so insecure to participate", she stated. Bokota ended by saying that they would announce the artist within the next five to ten days and that a possible backup was [[Elena Paparizou|Helena Paparizou]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://esctoday.com/news/read/3406|title=ERT excludes Despina Vandi from selection|last=Bakker|first=Sietse|date=2004-11-28|publisher=''ESCToday''|accessdate=2008-09-23}}</ref> Around the same time, another name, [[Annette Artani]] also became a popular rumour. The Greek-American songwriter was still participating in ''[[Fame Story]]'' at the time and rumours expected her to pull out of the competition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/3383|title='Annette Stamatelatos to Kiev for Greece'|date=23 November 2004|publisher=ESCToday|accessdate=20 March 2012}}</ref> On December 5, 2004, [[Anna Vissi]] was reportedly also in negotiations with ERT and on December 8, 2004, Daphne Bokota once again spoke on the issue saying that there would be a delay in the decision because of some sort of "obstacle" within the broadcaster.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oikotimes.com/ |title=ERT and Anna Vissi negotiate for Eurovision 2005|date=2004-12-05|publisher=''Oikotimes''|accessdate=2008-09-23 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20041207090123/http://oikotimes.com/ |archivedate = 2004-12-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://oikotimes.com/ |title=ERT postpones announcements.

Finally on January 22, 2005, ERT announced that it had selected Helena Paparizou, former member of the [[Greeks in Sweden|Greek-Swedish]] duet [[Antique (duo)|Antique]] which had represented Greece at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2001|2001 contest]], achieving 3rd place. Deals with Artani and Vissi that were also going on at the time failed to materialize.<ref name="Phillips">{{cite web|url=http://esctoday.com/news/read/3661|title=Helena Paparizou to represent Greece|last=Phillips|first=Roel|date=2005-01-22|publisher=''ESCToday''|accessdate=2008-09-23}}</ref> In Vissi's case, one factor may have been scheduling issues, as during the time of the contest she was in the United States promoting "[[Call Me (Anna Vissi song)|Call Me]]". In a press release, ERT stated that Paparizou's singing career in [[Sweden]] was "a factor which surely contributed to the final choice of Paparizou, since the 'northern' votes are considered to be important".<ref name="Phillips"/> Shortly before the announcement of Paparizou's participation, Bokota was fired from ERT for unknown reasons; she was the one who had originally proposed to her.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/3664|title=Daphne Bokota proposed Helena Paparizou!|last=Bakker|first=Sietse|date=2005-01-22|publisher=''ESCToday''|accessdate=2008-10-04}}</ref>

==National final==
[[File:Alexandra Pascalidou.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Greek-Swedish journalist [[Alexandra Pascalidou]] who hosted the national final replaced long-running commentator [[Dafni Bokota]].]]
After selecting Paparizou, ERT decided to pick four candidate songs, and host a national final where the Greek public, along with a jury, would select their favorite song. Voting to select the song at the national final would be conducted through [[televoting]] and [[Short message service|SMS texting]] by the public, and a nine-member "expert jury", weighted 60% and 40% respectively.<ref name="presentssongs" /><ref name="text">{{cite web|url=http://esctoday.com/news/read/3933|title=Greece: Helena to sing 'My number one'|last=Bakker|first=Sietse|date=2005-03-03|publisher=''ESCToday''|accessdate=2008-09-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oikotimes.com/site/index.php?id=603|title=Greek chaos to end on March 2; Two pre-shows scheduled|last=Konstantopoulos|first=Fotis|date=2005-02-18|publisher=''Oikotimes''|accessdate=2008-09-23 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20050219040256/www.oikotimes.com/site/index.php?id=603 |archivedate=2005-02-19}}</ref>  The jury would be made up of Mimis Plesas, Antonis Andrikakis, Kostas Tournas, [[<U+017D>eljko Joksimovi<U+0107>]], Betty Golema, Ion Stamboulis, Fotini Giannoulatou, Sietse Bakker, and Christos Liritzis.<ref name="ertfinal">{{cite web|url=http://eurovision.ert.gr/2005/en/news.asp?id=5824|title="My Number One" is the Winner!|last=Keleri|first=Vicky|date=2005-03-03|publisher=''[[Ellinik<U+00ED> Radiofon<U+00ED>a Tile<U+00F3>rasi]]''|accessdate=2008-11-16}}</ref>

Out of 100 the songs that were sent in by Greek and foreign artists, a committee made up of representatives from ERT, [[Sony BMG]], and Paparizou, chose 15 songs initially and then narrowed the selection down to four.<ref name="100songs">{{cite web|url=http://eurovision.ert.gr/2005/en/news.asp?id=5547|title=Heading Strong for Greek Final|last=Hristopoulou|first=Despina|date=2005-02-21|publisher=''[[Ellinik<U+00ED> Radiofon<U+00ED>a Tile<U+00F3>rasi]]''|accessdate=2008-11-16}}</ref> On a special show broadcast on February 18 titled ''EuroMania'', the four songs were presented to the Greek public as: "[[My Number One]]" composed by [[Christos Dantis]] with lyrics by Dantis and [[Natalia Germanou]], "OK" composed by Christodoulos Siganos with lyrics by Siganos and Valentino, "Let's Get Wild" written by Douglas Carr.<ref name="presentssongs">{{cite web|url=http://esctoday.com/news/read/3862|title=Helena Paparizou presents Greeks songs|last=Bakker|first=Sietse|date=2005-02-21|publisher=''ESCToday''|accessdate=2008-09-23}}</ref> and "[[The Light in Our Soul]]" written by Kostas Bigalis.  On February 19, it was revealed that "The Light in Our Soul" had been released and made available on [[Amazon.com|Amazon.de]] by a band named "Big Alice" on May 25, 2004 and therefore disqualifying the song from the competition. According to contest rules, a song cannot be released before October 1 of the previous year.  This revelation trimmed down the four candidate songs to three.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://esctoday.com/news/read/3867|title=Greece: song Bigalis released on CD in 2004|last=Bakker|first=Sietse|date=2005-02-22|publisher=''ESCToday''|accessdate=2008-09-23}}</ref> The choreography for all songs was arranged by Fokas Evangelinos.<ref name="100songs" /> Following the selection of the songs, a second special Eurovision show was broadcast on February 25, 2005, to familiarize the Greek public with the artist. 

The national final took place on March 2, 2005 at "Club Fever" and was hosted by Greek-Swede journalist and television-presenter [[Alexandra Pascalidou]].<ref name="pascalidou">{{cite web|url=http://eurovision.ert.gr/2005/en/news.asp?id=4878|title=A.
