'''Henry de Sully''' was a medieval [[Abbot of F<U+00E9>camp]] and [[Bishop of Salisbury|Bishop-designate of Salisbury]] and [[Archbishop of York|Archbishop-elect of York]].

==Life==

Henry was the son of [[William, count of Chartres]] the eldest brother of King [[Stephen of England]] and [[Henry of Blois]], [[Bishop of Winchester]].<ref name=Davis97>Davis ''King Stephen'' p. 97</ref> Henry's mother was William's wife Agnes who had been attached to the household of [[Adela of Blois]], William's mother. Although William was the eldest son of Adela and her husband [[Stephen II, Count of Blois]], he was passed over for the comital title and his younger brother [[Theobald II, Count of Champagne|Theobald]] became Count of Champagne on their father's death.<ref name=LoPrete>LoPrete ''Adela Countess and Lord'' p. 216</ref>

Henry became a [[Cluniac monk]], and  was nominated in March 1140 by Henry of Blois to be Bishop of Salisbury, but the nomination was quashed.<ref name=BHOSalis>[http://british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=34219 British History Online Bishops of Salisbury] accessed on 14 September 2007</ref><ref name=Davis>Davis ''King Stephen'' p. 44</ref> As compensation, Henry of Blois then named Henry de Sully the [[abbot]] of [[F<U+00E9>camp Abbey]] in [[Normandy]].<ref name=Davis97/> Later in 1140, after his grandmother's death, Henry was nominated to become Archbishop of York,<ref name=BHOYork>[http://british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=8457 British History Online Archbishops of York] accessed on 14 September 2007</ref> but his election was again quashed this time by Pope [[Pope Innocent II|Innocent II]] because Henry wished to hold both the abbacy of  F<U+00E9>camp along with the archbishopric.<ref name=Huscroft134>Huscroft ''Ruling England 1042<U+2013>1217'' p. 134</ref><ref name=Church96>Barlow ''The English Church 1066<U+2013>1154'' p. 96</ref> Henry died at F<U+00E9>camp in 1189.<ref name=BHOSalis/>
