'''Palm-wine music''' (known as '''maringa''' in [[Sierra Leone]]) is a [[West Africa]]n [[musical genre]].  It evolved among the [[Kru]] people of Sierra Leone and [[Liberia]], who used [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[guitar]]s brought by sailors, combining local melodies and rhythms with [[Trinidad and Tobago|Trinidadian]] [[calypso music|calypso]].  Palm-wine music was named after a drink, [[palm wine]], made from the naturally fermented sap of the oil palm, which was drunk at gatherings where early African guitarists played.

Palm-wine music was first popularized by [[Ebenezer Calendar & His Maringar Band]], who recorded many popular songs in the [[1950s]] and early [[1960s]].  Palm-wine music left an influence on many styles, especially [[soukous]] and [[highlife]].  Though still somewhat popular, the genre is no longer as renowned as it once was. Other renowned Palm-wine musicians include [[S. E. Rogie]], [[Daniel Amponsah]], [[Abdul Tee-Jay]] and [[Super Combo]].
