The '''Middle Dutch Church''', today known as '''Middle Collegiate Church''' refers to a [[Dutch Reformed]] congregation in [[Manhattan]] in [[New York City]], which has had a variety of church buildings and had fractured into several successor congregations run by the [[Reformed Protestant Dutch Churches of New York]]. The congregation was established in 1628.<ref name=collegiate>[http://www.upword.com/collegiate/church.html Congregation History]</ref>

==1839 Second Middle Collegiate Church, or Middle Dutch Church==
The Middle Dutch Church or Middle Collegiate Church (1839), located on Lafayette Place near [[Colonnade Row|La Grange Terrace]], was built as the second Collegiate Church congregation continued to move uptown with the population. Nathan Silver in ''Lost New York'' describes this structure as "a single-mindedly classic Greek Revival church by [[Isaiah Rogers]], perhaps his best work. Unfortunately for posterity, the Dutch Reformed (Collegiate) denomination was wealthy enough to move as frequently as the neighborhood ran down. The church<U+2019>s forerunner was built in 1729 at Nassau Street, later became the Post Office, and was demolished in 1882. After the Lafayette Place church was evacuated in 1887 prior to its destruction, a third church was erected at Second Avenue and 7th Street, 'thoroughly equipped' as one guide said, 'with reading-rooms, gymnasium, and all appliances for aggressive modern church work'."<ref name=silver/>
