An '''embedded database''' system is a [[database management system]] (DBMS) which is tightly integrated with an [[application software]] that requires access to [[computer data storage|stored data]], such that the database system is "hidden" from the application<U+2019>s end-user and requires little or no ongoing maintenance. It is actually a broad technology category that includes database systems with differing [[application programming interface]]s ([[SQL]] as well as proprietary, native APIs); database architectures ([[client-server]] and in-process); storage modes (on-disk, [[in-memory database|in-memory]] and combined); [[database model]]s ([[relational database|relational]], [[object database|object-oriented]], [[entity<U+2013>attribute<U+2013>value model]] and network/[[CODASYL]]); and target markets. 

The term ''embedded database'' can be confusing because only a small subset of embedded database products is used in [[real-time computing|real-time]] [[embedded system]]s such as [[telephone switch#Digital switches|telecommunications switches]] and [[consumer electronics]] devices.<ref>Graves, Steve.  [http://www.embedded-computing.com/articles/id/?2020 "COTS Databases For Embedded Systems"], ''Embedded Computing Design'' magazine, January, 2007. Retrieved on August 13, 2008.</ref> (See [[mobile database]] for small-footprint databasees that could be used on embedded devices.)

transactional, multi-user with a decent SQL subset, Derby is a mature
engine and freely available under the Apache license and is actively
maintained. [http://db.apache.org/derby Derby project page]. It is also
distributed as part of Oracle's Java SE Development Kit (JDK) under the name of Java DB.

===csharp-sqlite===
C#-SQLite is a port of the [[SQLite]] embedded SQL database engine, versionn 3.7.7.1, from the original native C into fully managed C#. The port is complete aside from some minor optional features of SQLite. [http://code.google.com/p/csharp-sqlite/ csharp-sqlite project page]

===CSQL===
CSQL is an open source transactional, persistent in-memory SQL database engine.[http://sourceforge.net/projects/csql csql project page]

ElevateDB operates in single-user, multi-user file-sharing, and client-server modes, and includes the ElevateDB Server for client-server operation.

===Embedded InnoDB===
{{main|InnoDB}}
[http://www.innodb.com/wp/products/embedded-innodb/ Embedded InnoDB] is a standalone, embeddable form of the InnoDB Storage Engine.  Given that Embedded InnoDB is based on the same code base as the InnoDB Storage Engine, it contains many of the same features: high-performance and scalability, [[multiversion concurrency control]] (MVCC), row-level locking, deadlock detection, fault tolerance, automatic crash recovery, etc.  However, because the embedded engine is completely independent from MySQL, it lacks server components such as networking, object-level permissions, etc.  By eliminating the MySQL server overhead, InnoDB has a small footprint and is well-suited for embedding in applications which require high-performance and concurrency.  As with most embedded database systems, Embedded InnoDB is designed to be accessed primarily with an ISAM-like C API rather than SQL (though an extremely rudimentary SQL variant is supported).

Embedded InnoDB has not seen any product updates since 2009 (and downloads currently seem to be broken), but a non-Oracle maintained fork exists with [http://www.haildb.com/ HailDB].

===Empress Embedded Database===
{{main|Empress Embedded Database}}

Applications developed using these APIs may be run in standalone and/or server modes.  Empress Embedded Database runs on Linux, [[Unix]], Microsoft Windows and [[real-time operating system]]s.

===Extensible Storage Engine===
{{main|Extensible Storage Engine}}
ESE is an Indexed Sequential Access Method (ISAM) data storage technology from Microsoft. ESE is notably a core of Microsoft Exchange Server and Active Directory.

The initial product was soon joined by eXtremeDB High Availability (HA) for [[fault tolerant]] applications. The product family now includes 64-bit and [[transaction log]]ging editions, and the hybrid eXtremeDB Fusion, which combines in-memory and on-disk data storage. In 2008, McObject introduced eXtremeDB Kernel Mode, the first embedded DBMS designed to run in an operating system [[kernel (computing)|kernel]].<ref>Gorine, Andrei and Krivolapov, Alexander. [http://www.ddj.com/database/207401567/ "Kernel Mode Databases: A DBMS Technology For High-Performance Applications"], ''Dr. Dobb's Journal'', April, 2008.  Retrieved on August 13, 2008.</ref> Today, eXtremeDB is used in millions of real-time and embedded systems worldwide. McObject also offers [[Perst]], an [[open source]], object-oriented embedded database for Java, [[Java ME]], .NET, [[.NET Compact Framework]] and [[Silverlight]].

===Firebird Embedded===
{{main|Firebird (database server)}}
Firebird Embedded is a relational database engine. It's an open source fork of InterBase, is [[ACID]] compliant, supports triggers and stored procedures, and is available on Linux and Win32/Win64 systems. It has the same features as the classic and superserver version of Firebird, two or more  threads (and applications) can access the same database at the same time starting with Firebird 2.5. So Firebird embedded acts as a local server for one threaded client accessing its databases (that means it works properly for ASP.NET web applications, because there, each user has its own thread, which means two users could access the same database at the same time, but they would not be in the same thread, because ASP.NET opens a new thread for each user). It exports the standard Firebird API entrypoints. The main advantage of Firebird embedded databases is, that unlike SQlite or Access databases, they can be plugged-in to a full Firebird server without any modifications at all also is multiplatform (runs on Linux, OS X with full asp.net mono support)

===H2===
{{main|H2_(DBMS)}}

===LightningDB===
{{main|Lightning Memory-Mapped Database}}
[[Lightning Memory-Mapped Database|LightningDB]] is a memory-mapped database developed by [http://www.symas.com Symas] for the [[OpenLDAP]] Project. It is written in C and the API is modeled after the [[Berkeley DB]] API, though much simplified. The library is extremely compact, compiling down to under 40KB of x86 object code, corruption proof, and orders of magnitude faster, more robust, more scalable, and more efficient than similar libraries like [[Berkeley DB]], [[LevelDB]], etc. The library implements B+trees with [[multiversion concurrency control]] (MVCC), [[Single_level_store]], [[Copy_on_write]] and provides full [[ACID]] transactions with no deadlocks. The library is optimized for high read concurrency; readers need no locks at all. Readers don't block writers and writers don't block readers, so read performance scales perfectly linearly across arbitrarily many threads and CPUs. Third-party wrappers exist for [http://code.google.com/p/libglim/source/browse/trunk/mdb.hpp C++], [https://github.com/alepharchives/emdb Erlang] and [https://github.com/dw/py-lmdb Python].
