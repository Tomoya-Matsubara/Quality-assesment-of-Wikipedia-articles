'''''Unhalfbricking''''' is the third album by British [[folk rock]] band [[Fairport Convention]], released in 1969. It is seen as a transitional album in their history and marked a further musical move away from American influences towards more traditional English [[folk song]]s that had begun on their previous album, ''[[What We Did On Our Holidays]]''<ref name = Allmusic/> and arguably reached its peak on the follow-up, ''[[Liege & Lief]]'', released later the same year.

Although featuring several at the time unreleased [[Bob Dylan]] songs, the album also marked [[Sandy Denny]]'s maturation as a singer and songwriter, including "[[Who Knows Where the Time Goes?]]", a song covered by many other performers and now regarded as a classic.<ref>
{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio2/soldonsong/songlibrary/indepth/whoknows.shtml
|title=Sold on Song - Song Library - Who Knows Where The Time Goes |publisher=[[BBC]]
|accessdate=2008-08-03 }}</ref> The only traditional song on the album, "A Sailor's Life", is seen as pivotal in the development of English folk rock music.

Changes in the line-up of the band, due to not only to its musical direction but also to external events, mark this album as a turning point in the band's history. 1969 was a prolific year for Fairport Convention; from ''[[What We Did On Our Holidays]]'' to ''[[Liege & Lief]]'' within twelve months represented a major development.

The album also gave the band their first UK chart success, reaching number 12 in the [[UK album chart]], while the single release, "[[Si Tu Dois Partir]]", achieved number 21 in the [[UK singles chart]].<ref name = charts>{{UKChartHits|2106}}</ref>

==Music==
After their previous album had seen original singer [[Judy Dyble]] replaced by [[Sandy Denny]], the group's male vocalist [[Iain Matthews]] left during the recordings for ''Unhalfbricking'',<ref>{{cite web
|url=http://www.iainmatthews.com/bio.htm |title=Biography |publisher=www.iainmatthews.com
|accessdate=2008-08-10}}</ref> and Denny took a more central role. The band had been invited to [[Bob Dylan]]'s London music publishers to hear then unreleased tracks from [[The Basement Tapes]], and of this the band's [[bass guitar|bassist]], [[Ashley Hutchings]], said "this strange, kind of mish-mash of styles and drawled lyrics came out of the speakers. It sounded kind of subterranean; there was this strange cloak of weirdness covering them. We loved it all. We would have covered all the songs if we could."<ref name = Observer>{{cite news |work = [[The Observer]]

The [[french language|French]] lyrics for the latter were created during the interval of a performance at the [[Middle Earth Club]].<ref name = unterberger>

|first=Richie}}</ref> According to guitarist [[Simon Nicol]] "I think the boredom factor was one of the reasons we came up with this wacky idea. Three or four punters joined us in the dressing room; they were either French visitors or students of French working in London, and happened to be there that night."<ref name = unterberger/>

Meanwhile Denny's "Autopsy", "[[Who Knows Where the Time Goes?]]" (which would become her signature song), and the lengthy "A Sailor's Life" were also included. The latter track had been a traditional English folk song collected by [[A. L. Lloyd]] and already part of Denny's club repertoire. In particular, the version on ''Unhalfbricking'' has been described as "the turning point of Fairport's history from earlier contemporary Americana to English songs"<ref>

Guitarist [[Richard Thompson (musician)|Richard Thompson]] contributed two compositions to the album. The opening track, "Genesis Hall", is a slow song in [[waltz]]-time, on which he played [[Appalachian dulcimer|dulcimer]], and Sandy Denny provided the vocals; it was the B-Side of the single release.<ref>{{cite web

==Background==
On 11 May 1969,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&&sql=11:jjfuxqt5ldhe
|title=allmusic ((( Martin Lamble > Overview ))) |publisher=[[Allmusic]] |accessdate=2008-08-07
|last=Unterberger |first=Richie }}</ref> two months before the album was released, a serious road accident as the band were returning from a gig in Birmingham claimed the lives of drummer [[Martin Lamble]] and Jeannie Franklyn (a noted dress designer and guitarist [[Richard Thompson (musician)|Richard Thompson]]'s girlfriend).<ref name = Nicol>{{cite web | url = http://www.fairportconvention.com/simon_nicol_on_fairport.php | title = History: Simon Nicol writes about Fairport | accessdate = 2008-05-05}}</ref> Simon Nicol's later analysis of this event shows the turning-point that the band faced: {{quote|That was a big watershed, I think. In the aftermath, we thought a lot about what to do, whether to call it a day. It had been fun while it lasted but it took a definite effort of will to continue. It had given us a lot but now it had taken away a lot: was it worth it if it was going to cost people their lives? Martin was only 18 or 19 years old. He would have gone on to have been so much more than just another drummer, another musician: there was something very special about him.<ref name = Nicol/>}} Ashley Hutchings also said in relation to the album cover photograph: {{quote|My memory of it is bound up with the terrible car crash. On the back cover we're all eating around a table. The shirt and the leather waistcoat I'm wearing are what I had on when the crash happened. I can clearly remember them being bloodstained. You don't forget things like that.<ref name= Observer/>}}

''Unhalfbricking'' appeared, therefore, at a difficult time for the group, but was enthusiastically received. After a period of intense reflection about their future they decided to pursue the folk rock idea further and violinist [[Dave Swarbrick]] was invited to join full-time for the follow-up, ''[[Liege & Lief]]''.<ref name =Allmusic/>

==Title and cover==
The title arose from a word-game played by the band while travelling to and from gigs.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://observer.guardian.co.uk/omm/story/0,,1240058,00.html | title = Unhalfbricking, Fairport Convention | date = June 20, 2004 | accessdate = 2008-05-04}}</ref> The object of the game, named "Ghosts", was to "avoid completing a real word",<ref>{{cite web

The cover of the [[United States|American]] release by [[Hannibal Records]] was even more minimal, featuring circus elephants and a small inset image of the band.<ref>{{cite journal | url = http://www.frieze.com/issue/article/pavement_to_penthouse/ | journal = [[Frieze Art Fair|Frieze Magazine]] | title = Pavement to penthouse - The aesthetics of folk | issue = 68 |date = July - August 2002 | last = Powell | first = Aubrey | accessdate = 2008-08-08}}</ref>

==Reception and influence==
[[Allmusic]]'s [[Richie Unterberger]] described ''Unhalfbricking'' as "a transitional album for the young Fairport Convention, in which the group shed its closest ties to its American folk-rock influences and started to edge toward a more traditional British folk-slanted sound".<ref name = Allmusic/>

[[Rolling Stone]]'s [[John Mendelsohn]], reviewing ''Unhalfbricking'' alongside ''[[Liege and Lief]]'', was supportive, describing it as "Fairport Convention at its best" and singling out "Percy's Song" in particular as "the album's gem". He was less complimentary about "A Sailor's Life", regarding it as overlong.<ref>{{cite journal | last= Mendelsohn | first = John |date = [[11 June]] [[ 1970]] |title = Fairport Convention | url = http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/fairportconvention/albums/album/244718/review/5943317/unhalfbricking | journal = [[Rolling Stone]] }}</ref>

The album also gave the band their first UK chart success, spending a total of eight weeks in the [[UK album chart]] and reaching number 12.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.chartstats.com/albuminfo.php?id=2464 | accessdate = 2008-08-07 | title = Unhalfbricking}}</ref> The single "[[Si Tu Dois Partir]]" spent nine weeks on the [[UK singles chart]] and reached number 21.<ref name = charts>{{UKChartHits|2106}}</ref> [[Fairport Convention]] appeared on [[Top of the Pops]] on 14 August 1969 for their first and only time, featuring a guest appearance by [[John Peel]].<ref>{{cite web
