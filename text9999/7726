==History==

===Construction===
John F. Kennedy International Airport was originally '''Idlewild Airport''' {{Airport codes|IDL|KIDL|IDL}} after the Idlewild Golf Course that it displaced. It was built to relieve [[LaGuardia Airport]] which was crowded soon after opening in 1939. Construction began in 1943 by local firms such as the Edenwald Group headed by the late Charles Follini Sr. About $60 million was initially spent, but only {{convert|1000|acre|ha}} of land on the site of the Idlewild golf course were earmarked for use.<ref name="newsday">{{cite news |title=Major Airports Take Off|first=Rhonda|last=Amon|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/newsday/access/29457155.html?dids=29457155:29457155&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=May+13%2C+1998&author=BY+RHODA+AMON.+STAFF+WRITER&pub=Newsday+(Combined+editions)&desc=LONG+ISLAND%3A+OUR+STORY+%2F+Major+Airports+Take+Off+%2F+Mayor+LaGuardia's+complaint+leads+to+an+airport%3B+but+soon%2C+another+is+needed.+SIDEBAR%3A+LEGACY+%2F+LI-MACARTHUR+AIRPORT+GROWS+AS+AN+ALTERNATIVE+(see+end+of+text)&pqatl=google|newspaper=[[Newsday]]|date=May 13, 1998|accessdate=July 7, 2012}}</ref>

The project was renamed '''Major General Alexander E. Anderson Airport''' in 1943 after a Queens resident who had commanded a Federalized National Guard unit in the southern United States and who had died in late 1942. In March 1948 the [[New York City Council]] changed it to '''New York International Airport, Anderson Field''', but the common name was "Idlewild" until 1963.<ref name="lpc">{{cite web |title=Trans World Airlines Flight Center (now TWA Terminal A) at New York International Airport|url=http://www.npclibrary.org/db/bb_files/Trans-World-Airlines-Flight-Centre.pdf|work=Landmarks Preservation Commission|date=July 14, 1994|accessdate=July 7, 2012}}</ref>

The Port Authority leased the airport property from the City of New York in 1947 and maintains this lease as of the late 2000s.<ref name="panynj_pr">{{cite press release |title=Governor Pataki and Mayor Bloomberg Announce Closing of Multi-Billion Dollar Agreement to Extend Airport Leases|url=http://www.panynj.gov/AboutthePortAuthority/PressCenter/PressReleases/PressRelease/index.php?id=607|publisher=[[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey]]|date=November 30, 2004|accessdate=August 8, 2007|quote=The Port Authority has operated JFK and LaGuardia for more than 55 years.

The airport opened with six runways and a seventh under construction;<ref>{{cite web |title=Aerial Pic Looking WSW|url=http://iarchives.nysed.gov/PubImageWeb/viewImageData.jsp?id=139671|work=New York State Archives|date=December 31, 1949|accessdate=June 2, 2012}}</ref> runways 1L and 7L were held in reserve and never came into use as runways.

Runway 4 (originally 8,000&nbsp;ft, now runway 4L) opened June 1949 and runway 4R was added ten years later. A smaller runway 14/32 was constructed after runway 7R closed and was used through 1990.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nycaviation.com/forum/threads/25224-The-lost-runway-of-JFK |title=The lost runway of JFK? |publisher=Nycaviation.com |date=2007-07-21 |accessdate=2013-06-27}}</ref> This short runway was used by [[general aviation]], [[STOL]], and smaller commuter flights.{{fact|date=July 2013}}

{{cn-span|text=The [[Avro Jetliner]] landed at Idlewild on April 18, 1950 and maybe in January 1951; a [[Sud Aviation Caravelle]] prototype was the next jet airliner to land at Idlewild, on May 2, 1957. Later in 1957 the USSR sought approval for two [[Tupolev Tu-104]] flights carrying Soviet diplomats to Idlewild; the Port Authority did not allow them, saying noise tests had to be done first. (The Caravelle had been tested at Paris.)|date=July 2013}}

The airport was renamed '''John F. Kennedy International Airport''' on December 24, 1963, one month after the [[assassination of President John F. Kennedy]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Idlewild Is Rededicated as John F.

===Development===
The Port of New York Authority originally planned a single 55-gate terminal, but the major airlines did not agree with this plan, arguing that the terminal would be far too small for future traffic.<ref name="gordon">Alastair Gordon, ''Naked Airport'' (U. of Chicago Press)</ref> Architect [[Wallace Harrison]] then designed a master plan under which each major airline at the airport would be given its own space to develop its own terminal design.<ref name="pearman">Hugh Pearman, ''Airports'' (Laurence King).</ref> This scheme made construction more practical, made terminals more navigable and introduced incentives for airlines to compete with each other for the best design.<ref name="gordon" /> The revised plan met airline approval in 1955, with seven terminals initially planned<U+2014>five for individual airlines, one developed for 3 airlines, and an international arrivals building. (National Airlines and British Airways arrived later.)<ref name="lpc" />

* The International Arrivals Building, or IAB, was the first new terminal project at the airport, designed by [[Skidmore, Owings and Merrill]] and opening in December 1957. Stretching nearly {{convert|700|m|ft|sp=us}} parallel to runway 7R where Terminal 4 is now, it was designed by [[Skidmore, Owings & Merrill]] and had "finger" piers at right-angles to the main building. These allowed a greater number of aircraft to park, a major innovation at the time.<ref name="lpc" />
* [[United Airlines]] opened Terminal 7 (later renumbered Terminal 9), a Skidmore design similar to that of the IAB, in October 1959. [[Eastern Airlines]] opened its [[Chester L. Churchill]]-designed Terminal 1 one month later.<ref name="lpc" /><ref>{{cite news |title=Bigger Than Grand Central|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,811406,00.html|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]]|date=November 9, 1959|accessdate=July 7, 2012}}</ref>
* [[American Airlines]] opened Terminal 8 in 1960. The terminal was designed by [[Kahn and Jacobs]]<ref name="lpc" /> and had a {{convert|317|ft|m}} [[stained glass]] facade designed by [[Robert Sowers]], the largest stained glass installation in the world until 1979. The facade was removed in 2007 as the terminal was demolished to make room for the new Terminal 8; American cited the prohibitive cost of removing the enormous installation.<ref>{{cite news |title=Demolishing a Celebrated Wall of Glass|first=Ruth|last=Ford|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/23/nyregion/thecity/23glas.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=July 23, 2006|accessdate=September 16, 2009}}</ref>
* [[Pan American World Airways]] opened the [[Worldport (Pan Am)|Worldport]] (later Terminal 3) in 1960. It featured a large, elliptical roof suspended by 32 sets of radial posts and cables; the roof extended {{convert|114|ft|m}} beyond the base of the terminal to cover the passenger loading area. It was one of the first airline terminals in the world to feature [[Jetway]]s that connected to the terminal and that could be moved to provide an easy walkway for passengers from the terminal to a docked aircraft, rather than having to board the plane outside via [[airstairs]], which descend from an aircraft, via truck-mounted mobile stairs, or via wheeled stairs.<ref name="time">{{cite news |title=Umbrella for Airplanes|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,940622,00.html|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]]|date=June 13, 1960|accessdate=July 7, 2012}}</ref>
* [[Trans World Airlines]] opened the [[TWA Flight Center]] in 1962, designed by [[Eero Saarinen]] with a distinctive winged-bird shape. With the demise of TWA in 2001, the terminal remained vacant until 2005 when [[JetBlue Airways]] and the [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey|Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PANYNJ)]] financed the construction of a new 26-gate terminal partly encircling the Saarinen building. Called now Terminal 5 (or simply T5), the new terminal opened October 22, 2008. T5 is connected to the Saarinen central building through the original passenger departure-arrival tubes which connected the building to the outlying gates; the Port Authority is working on restorations to the remaining original Saarinen terminal, also known as the head house.<ref>{{cite web |title=JetBlue&nbsp;<U+2013> Terminal 5 History|url=http://www.jetblue.com/about/jfk/icon.html|work=[[JetBlue Airways]]|date=October 22, 2008|accessdate=June 2, 2012}}</ref>

* [[National Airlines (NA)|National Airlines]] opened the [[Sundrome]] (now Terminal 6) in 1970. The terminal was designed by [[Pei Cobb Freed & Partners|I.M.Pei]].

{{cn-span|text=In 1951 Idlewild averaged 73 daily airline operations (takeoffs plus landings); the October 1951 Airline Guide shows nine domestic departures a day, on National and Northwest. (Some of TWA's transatlantic flights had domestic segments but carried no domestic passengers.) When Newark closed in February 1952 much of its traffic moved to Idlewild, which averaged 242 daily airline operations in 1952. L-1049 Constellations and DC-7s appeared in 1951<U+2013>53 and didn't use LGA for their first several years, bringing more traffic to IDL.

Airlines began scheduling jets into Idlewild in 1958<U+2013>59; LaGuardia didn't get jet airliners until 1964, so Idlewild soon became New York's busiest airline airport. In 1962<U+2013>67 it had more airline takeoffs and landings than LGA and EWR combined and was the second-busiest airline airport in the country, peaking at 403,981 airline operations in 1967. During 1960<U+2013>66 LaGuardia got a new terminal and longer runways, and by the middle 1970s the two airports had roughly equal passenger airline traffic (by flight count, not passenger count). (Until the 1980s Newark was always third place, except during LGA's reconstruction.) The supersonic [[Concorde]], operated by [[Air France]] and [[British Airways]], provided scheduled [[Transatlantic flight|trans-Atlantic]] [[supersonic]] service to JFK from November 22, 1977 until October 24, 2003, when Concorde was retired by both carriers.<ref>{{cite web |title=Concorde|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/europe/concorde.htm|work=GlobalSecurity.org|accessdate=July 7, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Concordes From London and Paris Land at Kennedy As 16-Month Trial Passenger Service Is Initiated|first=Richard|last=Witkin|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0E1EF83C5F127A93C1AB178AD95F438785F9|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=November 23, 1977|accessdate=March 20, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Covering Their Ears One Last Time for Concorde|first=Corey|last=Kilgannon|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/25/nyregion/covering-their-ears-one-last-time-for-concorde.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=October 25, 2003|accessdate=March 20, 2010}}</ref>

{{further2|[[Worldport (Pan Am)|Terminal 3 Worldport]]}}

Terminal 3 was built as the [[Worldport (Pan Am)|Worldport]] in 1960 for Pan American; it expanded after the introduction of the 747 in 1970. After Pan Am's demise in 1991 Delta Air Lines took over ownership of the terminal and was its only occupant until its closure in 2013, and had a connector to Terminal 2, Delta's other terminal. Terminal 3 had 16 Jetway equipped gates: 1<U+2013>10, 12, 14<U+2013>18 with two hardstand gates (Gate 11) and a helipad on Taxiway 'KK'.

A $1.2 billion project was completed in 2013, which Terminal 4 was expanded with Delta is moving its T3 operations to T4.  T3 will be entirely demolished in 2015 (including the 'flying saucer' roof) to provide additional aircraft parking stands to speed up ground handling.

On May 23, 2013 the final departure from the terminal, [[Delta Air Lines]] Flight 286, a [[Boeing 747-400]] to [[Tel Aviv]] [[Ben Gurion Airport]], departed from Gate 6 at 11:25pm local time. The terminal ceased operations on May 24, 2013, 53 years to the day from when it opened on May 24, 1960.<ref>{{cite web|last=Frischling|first=Steven|title=Photographer|url=http://boardingarea.com/blogs/flyingwithfish/2013/05/17/a-historic-chapter-in-aviation-closes-it-wont-be-documented/|accessdate=1 June 2013}}</ref> 

There has been large media outcry, particularly in other countries, concerning the demolition of the Worldport.

===Terminal 6 (Sundrome)===
{{Main|Sundrome}}Terminal 6 had 14 gates. Designed by [[I. M. Pei]], it was built in 1970 as the [[National Airlines (NA)|National Airlines]] [[Sundrome]]. Later, [[Trans World Airlines]] used it.  On June 1, 2006, [[JetBlue Airways]] began service from Terminal 6, opening a temporary complex that increased its capacity by adding seven gates. After JetBlue vacated the terminal, these were demolished.<ref>{{cite web |title=JetBlue's New T5 Terminal At JFK Airport|first=Jim|last=Romeo|url=http://www.constructionequipment.com/jetblues-new-t5-terminal-jfk-airport|work=Construction Equipment|date=October 19, 2008|accessdate=July 7, 2012}}</ref> The original building has been demolished to allow for an extension of Terminal 5 dedicated to JetBlue international service,  Terminal 5i.<ref>{{cite web |title=JFK Airport's Terminal 6: The Sad Demise of a Modern Design Marvel|first=Adrian|last=Covert|url=http://gizmodo.com/5847863/jfk-airports-terminal-6-the-sad-demise-of-a-modern-design-marvel|work=Gizmodo.com|date=October 7, 2011|accessdate=June 2, 2012}}</ref><ref name="jetblue1">{{cite press release |title=JetBlue Gets Green Light to Build New International Arrivals Extension to its Home at JFK's Terminal 5|url=http://investor.jetblue.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=131045&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=1701319&highlight=|publisher=[[JetBlue Airways]]|date=May 31, 2012|accessdate=June 13, 2012}}</ref>

===Old Terminal 8 and 9===
The original Terminal 8 opened in 1960; its stained-glass facade was the largest in existence at the time. It was always used by [[American Airlines]], and in later years it was used by other [[oneworld]] airlines that did not use Terminal 7. Terminal 9 opened in 1959 and was used by [[United Airlines]]<ref name="lpc" /> until it vacated the terminal in 1991 and became a tenant at British Airways' Terminal 7. Terminal 9 then became the home of American Airlines' domestic operations and [[American Eagle Airlines|American Eagle]] flights for the remainder of its life. The terminals were demolished in the early-to-mid-2000s and replaced with a new Terminal 8.

===Tower Air terminal===
The [[Tower Air]] terminal, unlike other terminals at JFK airport, sat outside the Central Terminals area in Building 213 in Cargo Area A. Originally used by [[Pan American World Airways|Pan Am]] until the expansion of the Worldport (later Terminal 3), it was later used by Tower Air and twa shuttle until the airline's collapse in 2000. Building 213 has not been used since 2000. It is located next to the Delta Air Lines employees parking lot number 7 which was once the Tower Air terminal parking lot.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

==Runways and operational infrastructure==
Four runways (two pairs of parallel runways) surround the airport's central terminal area.<ref>{{cite web |title=KJFK/JFK|url=http://www.airnav.com/airport/KJFK|work=AirNav|accessdate=July 7, 2012}}</ref>

JFK has over {{convert|25|mi|km}} of taxiways to move aircraft in and around the airfield. The standard width of these taxiways is {{convert|75|ft|m}}, with {{convert|25|ft|m|sing=on}} heavy-duty shoulders and {{convert|25|ft|m|adj=on}} erosion control pavements on each side. The taxiways have centerline lights and are generally of asphalt concrete composition 15 to {{convert|18|in|mm}} thick. An illuminated sign system provides directional information for taxiing aircraft.

The [[Air Traffic Control]] Tower, designed by [[Pei Cobb Freed & Partners]] and constructed on the ramp-side of Terminal 4, began full FAA operations in October 1994.<ref>{{cite web |title=FAA Air Traffic Control Tower, JFK International Airport|url=http://www.pcfandp.com/a/p/8412/s.html|work=Pei Cobb Freed|accessdate=July 7, 2012}}</ref> An Airport Surface Detection Equipment (ASDE) radar unit sits atop the tower. A gas-fired electric cogeneration plant generates electricity for the airport, with an output of about 90 megawatts. It uses thermal energy from the capture of waste heat to heat and cool all of the passenger terminals and other facilities in the central terminal area.<ref>JFK Plane Queue Picture -Shows relative sizing</ref>

Aircraft service facilities include seven aircraft hangars, an engine overhaul building, a {{convert|32|e6USgal|m3|adj=on}} aircraft fuel storage facility, and a truck garage.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

==Terminals==
[[File:JFK terminal map.jpg|thumb|A map of JFK's terminals]]
JFK has six terminals (ten until the late 1990s, then nine until the early 2000s, followed by eight until 2011 and seven until May 2013) containing 151 gates, numbered 1<U+2013>8, but skipping Terminal 6, the former [[Sundrome]], which was demolished in 2011 after Terminal 5 was expanded (the number will remain disused and skipped). Terminal 3, which is closed but still standing at this time, will also be a disused and skipped number when demolished.

The terminal buildings, with the exception of the former [[Tower Air]] terminal, are arranged in a deformed U-shaped wavy pattern around a central area containing parking, a power plant, and other airport facilities. The terminals are connected by the [[AirTrain JFK|AirTrain]] system and access roads. Wayfinding signage throughout the terminals was designed by [[Paul Mijksenaar]].<ref>{{cite web |title=New York and New Jersey Airports|url=http://www.mijksenaar.com/projects-quicktour/30-new_york_and_new_jersey_airports.html|date=May 18, 2009}}</ref> A 2006 survey by [[J.D. Power and Associates]] in conjunction with ''[[Aviation Week & Space Technology|Aviation Week]]'' found JFK ranked second in overall traveller satisfaction among large airports in the United States, behind [[McCarran International Airport]] which serves the [[Las Vegas metropolitan area]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Survey: JetBlue is Best Low-Cost Carrier|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/13619805/|work=[[NBC News]]|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=June 30, 2006|accessdate=September 16, 2009}}</ref>

Until the early 1990s, the terminals were known by the primary airlines that served it, except for Terminal 4, which was known as the International Arrivals Building. In the early 1990s, all of the terminals were given numbers except for the Tower Air terminal, which sat outside the Central Terminals area and was not numbered. Like in the other airports controlled by the Port Authority, terminals are sometimes managed and operated by independent terminal operators. At JFK, all terminals are currently operated by airlines or consortiums of the airlines serving them, with the exception of the [[Schiphol Group]]-operated Terminal 4. All terminals except Terminal 2 can handle international arrivals.

===Terminal 1===
[[Image:JFK Terminal 1.jpg|thumb|right|Terminal 1]]

Terminal 1 was opened in 1998, 50 years after the opening of JFK, at the direction of the Terminal One Group, a consortium of four key operating carriers: [[Air France]], [[Japan Airlines]], [[Korean Air]] and [[Lufthansa]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Terminal One Group website|url=http://www.jfkterminalone.com/home.html|work=Jfkterminalone.com|accessdate=June 2, 2012}}</ref> This partnership was founded after the four airlines reached agreement that existing international carrier facilities were inadequate for their needs.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Faircloth|first=Anne|date=May 11, 1998|title=Terminal One: The Antidote To JFK|journal=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]|url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1998/05/11/242061/index.htm|accessdate=September 16, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Airline Business Services JFK Terminal One Development Program|url=http://www.avairpros.com/project/jfktogadev.html|work=AvAirPros|date=August 10, 2005|accessdate=July 7, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Airline Business Services JFK Terminal One Operations|url=http://www.avairpros.com/project/jfktogaops.html|work=AvAirPros|date=August 10, 2005|accessdate=July 7, 2012}}</ref>  It was designed by William Nicholas Bodouva + Associates.<ref name="Bodouva">{{cite web |title=Aviation Projects|url=http://www.bodouva.com/aviation/|work=William Nicholas Bodouva and Associates|accessdate=June 13, 2012}}</ref>  Terminal 1, along with [[#Terminal 4|Terminal 4]],  has the capability to handle the superjumbo [[Airbus A380]] aircraft, which are flown by Air France on the route from [[Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport|Paris Charles De Gaulle]], Lufthansa on the route from [[Frankfurt Airport]] and Korean Air on the route from [[Incheon Airport]].  Air France operated [[Concorde]] here until 2003. Terminal 1 has 11 gates.

===Terminal 2===
Terminal 2 opened in 1962 as the home of [[Northeast Airlines]], [[Braniff]] and [[Northwest Airlines]], and is now used by [[Delta Air Lines]]. After the demise of Northeast Airlines and Braniff, the building was taken over by Pan American World Airways, and subsequently by Delta. Since the opening of the Terminal 4 addition in May 2013, Terminal 2 has been designated as the "C" gates by Delta, and has 8 Jetway-equipped gates (C60-C63, C67-C70) and 17 stands for [[Delta Connection]] carriers (C64A<U+2013>H, C64J, C66K<U+2013>N, C66P<U+2013>S).  It is also currently moving its international operations into a new expansion of Terminal 4 and demolishing Terminal 3. The project was approved by the Port Authority on August 5, 2010.<ref>{{cite news |title=Port Authority Approves Delta Renovations At JFK|first=Rocco|last=Vertuccio|url=http://origin.ny1.com/content/top_stories/123261/port-authority-approves-delta-renovations-at-jfk|work=[[NY1]]|date=August 5, 2010|accessdate=June 2, 2012}}</ref> T2 will be closed once Phase Two of the T4 expansion is completed by 2015.<ref name="Delta opens new JFK Terminal 4 hub">{{cite web|title=Delta opens new JFK Terminal 4 hub|url=http://www.qchron.com/editions/queenswide/delta-opens-new-jfk-terminal-hub/article_e93d0f7f-7d95-542f-a76d-6fd5d7112017.html|publisher=Queens Chronicle|accessdate=31 May 2013}}</ref>

===Terminal 4===
[[Image:JFKNewYorkTerm4 1.jpg|thumb|right|Terminal 4 replaced the former International Arrivals Building in May 2001]]
Terminal 4, the international terminal, is able to handle the [[Airbus A380]] and was developed by LCOR, Inc and is managed by the [[Schiphol Group]]. This terminal serves as a major international hub for [[Delta Air Lines]] and was the first one in the United States to be managed by a foreign airport operator. Terminal 4 is the major gateway for international arrivals at JFK. Opened in 2001 and designed by [[Skidmore, Owings and Merrill]],<ref>{{cite web |title=John F. Kennedy International Airport|url=http://www.som.com/content.cfm/jfk_international_airport_international_arrivals_building_terminal_4|work=[[Skidmore, Owings and Merrill]]|accessdate=June 13, 2012}}</ref> the new {{convert|1500000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} building was built at a cost of $1.4 billion and replaced JFK's old International Arrivals Building, or simply IAB, which opened in 1957.

Terminal 4 has 26 gates in two concourses: A2<U+2013>A7, B20, B22<U+2013>B41. As of 2013, Delta and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey agreed<ref>{{cite web|last=New York and New Jersey|first=Port Authority of|title=Minutes of Feb. 6, 2013 Meeting|url=http://www.panynj.gov/corporate-information/pdf/board_minutes_feb_6_2013-final.pdf|publisher=Port Authority of New York and New Jersey|accessdate=9 February 2013}}</ref> to an additional $175 million phase II expansion, which will allow Delta to construct 11 regional jet gates at Terminal 4, as well. The agreement allows Delta to eliminate a proposed physical connection it has previously planned to build with its existing Terminal 2 and instead close T2. The work on the Delta hub has commenced, with funding primarily from $900 million in special-project [[Bond (finance)|bonds]].<ref>{{cite news |title=World Trade Center Design Flaw Could Cost Millions|first=Chris|last=Hawley|url=http://www.news-record.com/content/2012/02/01/article/world_trade_center_design_flaw_could_cost_millions|newspaper=[[News & Record]]|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=February 1, 2012|accessdate=February 1, 2012}}</ref> Delta will [http://www.panynj.gov/corporate-information/pdf/board_minutes_feb_6_2013-final.pdf seek funding] for the regional jet expansion from the [http://www.nycedc.com/nycida New York City Industrial Development Agency.]

[[Concourse]] A has six gates, numbered A2<U+2013>A7. Concourse B has twenty gates, numbered B20<U+2013>B41, with the exclusion of B21. As Terminal 4 was built during the construction of the AirTrain, the AirTrain station was built inside the terminal building. Other AirTrain stations are built across from terminal buildings. Delta Air Lines has also moved much of its operations to T4, as it expands operations beyond T2, with T3 now closed.

The terminal was recently expanded on May 24, 2013, which includes nine new international gates, additional baggage space, customs and border-security facilities,<ref name="Delta opens new JFK Terminal 4 hub"/><ref>{{cite web |title=John F.

===Terminal 5===
{{Main|TWA Flight Center}}

[[File:JFK Terminal 5 Ticketing and Check-In.jpg|thumb|right|Terminal 5]]
Terminal 5 is operated by [[JetBlue Airways]], its main occupant, and opened in 2008. The terminal was re-designed by [[Gensler]] and constructed by [[Turner Construction]], and it is known for its many gift shops and gourmet restaurants, including a steak house and a sushi restaurant.  It sits behind the preserved [[Eero Saarinen]]-designed terminal originally known as the [[TWA Flight Center]], which is now connected to the new structure and is considered part of T5. The Saarinen building is currently closed for refurbishment; it is unclear when the building will reopen or what purpose it will have. Saarinen also designed the terminal at [[Washington Dulles International Airport]]. The active T5 building has 26 gates: 1<U+2013>12, 14<U+2013>27. There is no gate 13 at T5. The terminal is also used by [[Hawaiian Airlines]], which announced a partnership agreement with JetBlue and began service in Terminal 5 in June 2012.<ref>{{cite press release |title=New Hawaiian&nbsp;<U+2013> JetBlue Partnership Brings Hawaii Closer to East Coast Cities|url=http://investor.jetblue.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=131045&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=1651484&highlight=|publisher=[[JetBlue Airways]]|date=January 23, 2012|accessdate=July 7, 2012}}</ref> [[Aer Lingus]] moved to the terminal from Terminal 4 on April 3, 2013.<ref name="yahoo">[http://finance.yahoo.com/news/jetblue-welcome-irelands-aer-lingus-120000677.html;_ylt=A2KJ3Cb9KPtP0VIAYqzQtDMD JetBlue to Welcome Ireland's Aer Lingus into its Terminal at New York's Kennedy Airport&nbsp;<U+2013> Yahoo!

===Terminal 7===
Terminal 7 was designed by [[GMW Architects]]<ref>{{cite web |title=JFK Airport|url=http://www.gmw-architects.com/projects/portfolio/jfk%20airport|work=[[GMW Architects]]|accessdate=June 13, 2012}}</ref> and built for [[British Overseas Airways Corporation|BOAC]] and [[Air Canada]] in 1970.  It is currently operated by [[British Airways]]. This terminal is the only terminal owned and operated by a foreign carrier on US soil.  A variety of [[Oneworld]] alliance carriers operate out of Terminal 7 at this time, including British Airways, [[Cathay Pacific]], [[Iberia (airline)|Iberia]] (which is owned by the same parent company as British Airways), and [[Qantas]]. [[Star Alliance]] carriers [[United Airlines]], [[US Airways]] and [[All Nippon Airways|ANA]] also use the terminal.

On May 21, 2008, British Airways announced that it would undertake a $30 million, 18-month-long project to enhance its premium ground facilities at the terminal. British Airways is currently evaluating the future of Terminal 7, as its lease with the Port Authority ends in 2015. Management has indicated a desire to relocate British Airways/Iberia's operations to a new pier located east and connected to Terminal 8, pending approval of an alliance with American Airlines.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Future Of JFK's Terminals <U+0097> Civil Aviation Forum|url=http://www.airliners.net/aviation-forums/general_aviation/read.main/4724958/1/#1|work=Airliners.net|date=June 2, 2012|accessdate=June 2, 2012}}</ref>

===Terminal 8===
In 1999, [[American Airlines]] began an eight-year program to build the largest passenger terminal at JFK, designed by [[AECOM|DMJM Aviation]] to replace both Terminal 8 and Terminal 9. The new terminal was built in four phases, which involved the construction of a new midfield concourse, demolition of the old Terminal 9, and finally demolition of the old Terminal 8. It opened in stages between 2005 and had its "official" opening in August 2007.<ref>{{cite web |title=Industry Projects: JFK International Airport|url=http://www.airport-technology.com/projects/jfk/|accessdate=June 13, 2012}}</ref> It is a major [[Oneworld]] hub, and American Airlines is the major Oneworld carrier at Terminal 8.  American operates Terminal 8, is the largest carrier in the terminal, and is the third largest carrier at JFK.

*{{note|a|a}} International arrivals not from pre-cleared destinations are currently handled at Terminal 4, while all other flights are handled at Terminal 5.
*{{note|b|b}} Qantas flights to Sydney stop in Los Angeles. However, Qantas does not have the rights to transport passengers solely between New York and Los Angeles and thus only carries passengers continuing on Qantas flights to Australia.

Several city bus lines link JFK to the [[New York City Subway]] and [[Long Island Rail Road]], including the Q3, Q6 (Local/Limited), Q7, Q10 (Local/Limited), and B15, with free transfers provided for subway connections. The B15, Q3, and Q10 buses all serve the Central Terminal Area via a dedicated bus stop at the former Terminal 6 (connection to other terminals via AirTrain JFK), while the Q6 serves only eastern Cargo Area D and the USPS Airport Mail facility, and the Q7 serves only Cargo Area C. There are also many private bus lines operating express buses to Manhattan, the [[Hudson Valley]], and Long Island.

===Taxi===
New York City's yellow cabs, licensed by the [[New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission]], offer a flat rate service of $52 from JFK airport to Manhattan, excluding tips and tolls. Since November 30, 2006, this flat rate fare (excluding tips and tolls) applies to travel from Manhattan to JFK as well. Depending on the time of day, taxi travel from JFK to Midtown Manhattan can be as quick as 35 minutes. Door-to-door Car Service is another popular transportation option.

===Car===
JFK Airport is located in southern Queens on the [[Van Wyck Expressway]] (I-678), which can be accessed from the [[Belt Parkway]], the [[Grand Central Parkway]] and [[Queens Boulevard]]. A ring road connects the airport terminals to the Belt Parkway and the Van Wyck Expressway. The airport offers customers over 17,000 parking spaces, included in multi-level parking garages, surface spaces in the Central Terminal Area, a long-term parking lot and valet parking.<ref>{{cite web |title=Facts and Information|url=http://www.panynj.gov/COMMUTINGTRAVEL/airports/html/ken_facts.html|work=[[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey]]|accessdate=July 7, 2012}}</ref> There are also private off-site parking operators near the airport.

Van Wyck Expressway twists through the terminal nucleus and turns into the [[JFK Expressway]]. This four-lane expressway allows for more convenient access to the airport for Long Island users via the westbound Belt Parkway. Because it lies almost entirely within Kennedy Airport, the JFK Expressway was constructed, and is maintained by the Port Authority. The expressway was built as part of an ongoing, multi-billion overhaul of Kennedy Airport that began in the late 1980s. It was designed to relieve up to 30 percent of the traffic volume from the Van Wyck Expressway.<ref>{{cite web |title=JFK Expressway&nbsp;<U+2013> Historic Overview|url=http://www.nycroads.com/roads/jfk/|work=Eastern Roads Website|accessdate=July 7, 2012}}</ref>
Approximately 6 major rental car companies serve JFK Airport, with rental locations located on and off the airport. Each terminal's arrivals level (usually near the baggage carousel) has either a rental car counter or [[courtesy telephone]] for each of the car rental companies.

===Helicopter===

[[US Helicopter]] operated regularly scheduled flights every hour between Terminal 3 and the [[East 34th Street Heliport]]. Passengers traveling by helicopter to the airport passed through a security checkpoint at the heliport, not at JFK. On May 14, 2007, US Helicopter moved its operations from Terminal 9 to Terminal 3.<ref>{{cite press release |title=Delta Cuts Travel Time between Manhattan and JFK to Just Eight Minutes with US Helicopter<U+2019>s Airport Shuttle Service|url=http://flyush.com/pdfs/USH-Delta-Announcement.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=[[US Helicopter]]|accessdate=August 2, 2007|date=May 10, 2007}}</ref> US Helicopter announced that it was temporarily suspending operations on September 25, 2009 due to financial difficulties.<ref>{{cite news |title=U.S. Helicopter Halts Shuttle Service to J.F.K. and Newark|first=Patrick|last=McGeehan|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/26/nyregion/26heli.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=September 25, 2009|accessdate=September 26, 2009}}</ref>

[[New York Airways]] provided helicopter service from JFK to other area airports and heliports from 1955 to 1979, and [[Pan American World Airways]] continued Manhattan helicopter service during the 1980s in order to feed its JFK flights. During the 1970s, New York Helicopter offered JFK flights from the top of the then-[[MetLife Building|Pan Am Building]] in [[midtown Manhattan]], but this service was cancelled after a [[MetLife Building#Helicopter service|major accident in 1977]].<ref>{{cite news |title=New Helicopter Service Promises Wall St. to J.F.K., in 9 Minutes|first=Patrick|last=McGeehan|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E07E3DC173EF935A35751C0A9609C8B63|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=February 6, 2006|accessdate=September 16, 2009}}</ref>
