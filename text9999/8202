'''Indiana School for the Deaf (ISD) ''' is a fully accredited school for the [[Deaf]] and hard of hearing, located in [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]]. 

==History==
When the first school for the Deaf was established in Indiana, it was not called Indiana School for the Deaf. It was named Willard School, after the founder, [[William Willard]].

William Willard was a Deaf [[teacher]] who taught at [[Ohio School for the Deaf]] in [[Columbus, Ohio]]. He travelled to Indianapolis in May of 1843 to propose the establishment of a Deaf School. Once he had the support of the General Assembly, he recruited approximately twelve students. He and his wife, Eliza, were teachers. Eventually, the school had grown and a law which was passed in 1846 officially established the Willard School as the sixth state school for the Deaf and the first Deaf school to provide free education to Deaf and hard of hearing students. The school had actually moved a few times in different locations, when finally, the school was built on an 80 acre (32 hectare) property on East 42nd Street. The name was changed to Indiana School for the Deaf. The school's main buildings on the current campus are registered as historic landmarks.

==Philosophy==
The Bilingual/Bicultural Philosophy provides language acquisition and facilitates proficiency in two languages, [[American Sign Language]] (ASL), and [[English language|English]]. By providing an enriched academic and cultural learning environment, its Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing students develop a sense of identity within the Deaf community. Students also develop the knowledge, skills, and attitudes to function effectively with members of a multicultural, diversified community.

==Academics==
ISD offers several programs ranging from infants to high school. They are as follows: Parent Infant Program, [[Preschool]], [[elementary school|Elementary]], [[Middle School]], and [[High School]]. 

The Parent Infant Program works closely with parents and their deaf or hard of hearing children from ages 0 to 3. When a student reaches 18 months of age, he or she can enroll at ISD as an official student. Preschool handles children up until Pre-[[Kindergarten]]. Elementary provides academics and activities for Kindergarten through 5th grade students. Middle school hosts grades 6 to 8, and High School hosts grades 9 through 12.  

==Residency==
ISD is also a [[residential school]]. It has dormitories where students reside throughout the week. Students arrive on Sundays and depart on Fridays. Dormitories are for students who live far enough not to be able to travel by bus every day to school. There are dormitories for male and female students: Preschool, Elementary, Middle School, and High School. ISD's residential programs offers extracurricular activities, peer interaction, student growth and development, achievement, and more.
