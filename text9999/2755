The '''Australian Magpie''' (''Cracticus tibicen'') is a medium-sized black and white [[passerine]] bird native to Australia and southern New Guinea. A member of the [[Artamidae]], it is closely related to the [[butcherbird]]s. At one stage, the Australian Magpie was considered to be three separate species, although zones of hybridisation between forms reinforced the idea of a single species with several [[subspecies]], nine of which are now recognised. The adult Australian Magpie is a fairly robust bird ranging from 37&ndash;43&nbsp;cm (14.5&ndash;17&nbsp;in) in length, with distinctive black and white [[plumage]], red eyes and a solid wedge-shaped bluish-white and black bill. The male and female are similar in appearance, and can be distinguished by differences in back markings. With its long legs, the Australian Magpie walks rather than waddles or hops and spends much time on the ground. This adaptation has led to some authorities maintaining it in its own genus ''Gymnorhina''. Described as one of Australia's most accomplished songbirds, the Australian Magpie has an array of complex vocalisations.

The Australian Magpie is [[omnivore|omnivorous]], with the bulk of its varied diet made up of [[invertebrates]]. It is generally sedentary and territorial throughout its range. Common and widespread, it has adapted well to human habitation and is a familiar bird of parks, gardens and farmland in Australia and [[New Guinea]]. Magpies were introduced into [[New Zealand]] in the 1860s and are proving to be a pest by displacing native birds. Introductions also occurred in the [[Solomon Islands]] and [[Fiji]], where these birds have not become [[Invasive species|invasive]].

Spring in Australia is magpie season, when a small minority of breeding magpies (almost always males) around the country become aggressive and swoop and attack those who approach their nests, especially bike riders. This species is commonly fed by households around the country and is the mascot of several famous Australian sporting teams.

==Taxonomy==
The Australian Magpie was first described by English ornithologist [[John Latham (ornithologist)|John Latham]] in 1802 as ''Coracias tibicen'', the type collected in the [[Port Jackson]] region. Its [[specific name]] derived from the [[Latin]] ''tibicen'' "flute-player" or "piper" in reference to the bird's melodious call.<ref>{{cite book | last = Simpson | first = D.P. | title = Cassell's Latin Dictionary | publisher = Cassell Ltd. | date = 1979 | edition = 5 | location = London | pages = 883 | isbn = 0-304-52257-0}}</ref><ref name=Hig579>Higgins ''et al.'', p. 579</ref> An early recorded vernacular name is ''Piping Roller'', written on a painting by [[Thomas Watling]], one of a group known collectively as the [[Port Jackson Painter]],<ref name ="nhmuk">{{cite web | author = The Natural History Museum, London | title = "Piping Roller", native name "Tarra-won-nang" | work = First Fleet Artwork Collection | publisher = The Natural History Museum, London | date = 2007  | url = http://www.nhm.ac.uk/jdsml/nature-online/first-fleet/nathist.dsml?sa=1&lastDisp=gall&notes=true&beginIndex=210&enlarged=true%3fimage&desc=true&

The bird was named for its similarity in colouration to the [[European Magpie]]; it was a common practice for early settlers to name plants and animals after European counterparts.<ref name = "Kap3"/> However, the European Magpie is a member of the [[Corvidae]], while its Australian counterpart is placed in the [[Artamidae]] family (although both are members of a broad [[corvida|corvid]] lineage). The Australian Magpie's affinities with butcherbirds and currawongs were recognised early on and the three genera were placed in the family Cracticidae in 1914 by [[John Albert Leach]] after he had studied their musculature.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Leach |first=John Albert |authorlink=John Albert Leach |coauthors= |year=1914|title=The myology of the Bell-Magpie (''Strepera'') and its position in classification |journal=Emu  |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=2<U+2013>38}}</ref> American ornithologists [[Charles Sibley]] and [[Jon Edward Ahlquist|Jon Ahlquist]] recognised the close relationship between [[woodswallow]]s and the butcherbirds in 1985, and placed them in a Cracticini clade,<ref name="SibAhl85">{{cite journal|author=Sibley CG, Ahlquist JE|date=1985|title=The phylogeny and classification of Australo-Papuan passerine birds | journal=Emu |volume=85 |issue=1| pages=1<U+2013>14| url=http://www.publish.csiro.au/?act=view_file&file_id=MU9850001.pdf (fulltext)|accessdate=2009-04-15}}</ref> now the family Artamidae.<ref name=CB08>{{cite book |title=Systematics and Taxonomy of Australian Birds|author=Christidis L, Boles WE |year=2008 |publisher=CSIRO Publishing |location=Canberra |isbn=9780643065116 |page=196}}</ref> The Australian Magpie had been placed in its own genus ''Gymnorhina'', however several authorities, Storr in 1952 and later authors including Christidis and Boles in their 2008 official checklist, place it in the butcherbird genus ''Cracticus'', giving rise to its current binomial name; they argue that its adaptation to ground-living is not enough to consider it as a separate genus.<ref name=CB08/>

The Australian Magpie was subdivided into three species in the literature for much of the twentieth century<U+2014>the Black-backed Magpie (''G. tibicen''), the White-backed Magpie (''G. hypoleuca''), and the Western Magpie (''G. dorsalis'').<ref>{{cite journal|author=Serventy DL|date=1953|title=Some speciation problems in Australian birds: with particular reference to the relations between Bassian and Eyrean ?species-pairs?|journal=Emu|volume=53|issue=2|pages=131&ndash;45|doi=10.1071/MU953131 }}</ref> They were later noted to [[hybrid (biology)|hybridise]] readily where their territories crossed, with hybrid grey or striped-backed magpies being quite common. This resulted in them being reclassified as one species by [[Julian Ralph Ford|Julian Ford]] in 1969,<ref>{{cite journal|author=Ford J|date=1969|title=  The distribution and status of the Australian Magpie in Western Australia| volume=68|issue=4|pages=278&ndash;79|doi=10.1071/MU968278a }}</ref> with most recent authors following suit.<ref name=CB08/>
 
===Subspecies===

There are currently thought to be nine subspecies of the Australian Magpie, however there are large zones of overlap with intermediate forms between the taxa. There is a tendency for birds to become larger with increasing latitude, the southern subspecies being larger than those further north the exception being the Tasmanian form which is small.<ref name=Hig622>Higgins ''et al.'', p. 622</ref> The original form known as the '''Black-backed Magpie''' and classified as ''Gymnorhina tibicen'' has been split into four black-backed races: 

*''C. tibicen tibicen'', the [[Nominate subspecies#Nominate subspecies|nominate form]], is a large subspecies found in southeastern Queensland, from the vicinity of [[Moreton Bay]] through eastern [[New South Wales]] to [[Moruya, New South Wales]] almost to the Victorian border. It is coastal or near-coastal and is restricted to east of the [[Great Dividing Range]].<ref name="Hig579"/> 

*''C. tibicen terraereginae'', found from [[Cape York Peninsula|Cape York]] and the [[Gulf Country]] southwards across [[Queensland]] to the coast between [[Halifax Bay]] in the north and south to the [[Mary River (Queensland)|Mary River]], and central and western [[New South Wales]] and into northern [[South Australia]], is a small to medium-sized subspecies.<ref name=Hig579/> The plumage is the same as that of subspecies ''tibicen'', although the female has a shorter black tip to the tail. The wings and tarsus are shorter and the bill proportionally longer.<ref name=Hig620>Higgins ''et al.'', p. 620</ref>  It was originally described by [[Gregory Mathews]] in 1912, its subspecies name a [[Latin]] translation, ''terra'' "land" ''reginae'' "queen's" of "Queensland". Hybridisation with the large white-backed subspecies ''tyrannica'' occurs in northern Victoria and southeastern New South Wales; intermediate forms have black bands of varying sizes in white-backed area. Three-way hybridisation occurs between [[Bega, New South Wales|Bega]] and [[Batemans Bay, New South Wales|Batemans Bay]] on the New South Wales south coast.<ref name=Hig621>Higgins ''et al.'', p. 621</ref> 

*''C. tibicen eylandtensis'', the [[Top End]] Magpie, is found from the [[Kimberley (Western Australia)|Kimberley]] in northern Western Australia, across the [[Northern Territory]] through [[Arnhem Land]] and [[Groote Eylandt]] and into the Gulf Country.<ref name=Hig580/> It is a small subspecies with a long and thinner bill, with birds of Groote Eylandt possibly even smaller than mainland birds.<ref name=Hig624>Higgins ''et al.'', p. 624</ref> It has a narrow black terminal tailband,<ref name = "Kap7">Kaplan, p. 7</ref> and a narrow black band; the male has a large white nape, the female pale grey.<ref name=Hig624/> This form was initially described by [[Henry Luke White|H. L. White]] in 1922. It intergrades with subspecies ''terraereginae'' southeast of the [[Gulf of Carpentaria]].<ref name=Hig624/>

*''C. tibicen longirostris'', the Long-billed Magpie, is found across northern [[Western Australia]], from [[Shark Bay, Western Australia|Shark Bay]] into the [[Pilbara]].<ref name=Hig580/> Named in 1903 by Alex Milligan, it is a medium-sized subspecies with a long thin bill. Milligan speculated the bill may have been adapted for the local conditions, slim fare meaning the birds had to pick at dangerous scorpions and spiders.<ref name = "Kap6">Kaplan, p. 6</ref> There is a broad area of hybridisation with the western ''dorsalis'' in southern central Western Australia from [[Shark Bay, Western Australia|Shark Bay]] south to the [[Murchison River (Western Australia)|Murchison River]] and east to the [[Great Victoria Desert]].<ref name=Hig623>Higgins ''et al.'', p. 623</ref> 

The '''White-backed Magpie''', originally described as  ''G. hypoleuca'' by [[John Gould]] in 1837, has also been split into races: 

*''C. tibicen tyrannica'', a very large white-backed form found from [[Twofold Bay]] on the New South Wales far south coast, across southern [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] south of the Great Dividing Range through to the [[Coorong National Park|Coorong]] in southeastern South Australia. It was first described by [[Richard Schodde|Schodde]] and Mason in 1999.<ref name=Hig580/> It has a broad black tail band.<ref name = "Kap7"/>

*''C. tibicen telonocua'', found from [[Cowell, South Australia|Cowell]] south into the [[Eyre Peninsula|Eyre]] and [[Yorke Peninsula]]s in southern [[South Australia]], as well as the southwestern [[Gawler Ranges]]. Described by Schodde and Mason in 1999,<ref name=Hig580/> its subspecific name is an anagram of ''leuconota'' "white-backed". It is very similar to ''tyrannica'', differing in having a shorter wing and being lighter and smaller overall. The bill is relatively short compared with other magpie subspecies. Intermediate forms are found in the [[Mount Lofty Ranges]] and on [[Kangaroo Island]].<ref name=Hig622/> 

*''C. tibicen hypoleuca'' now refers to a small white-backed subspecies with a short compact bill and short wings, found on [[King Island, Tasmania|King]] and [[Flinders Island, Tasmania|Flinders Islands]], as well as [[Tasmania]].<ref name=Hig580/>

* The '''Western Magpie''', ''G. tibicen dorsalis'' was originally described as a separate species by [[Archibald James Campbell|A. J. Campbell]] in 1895 and is found in the fertile south-west corner of Western Australia.<ref name=Hig580/> The adult male has a white back and most closely resembles subspecies ''telonocua'', though it is a little larger with a longer bill and the black tip of its tail plumage is narrower. The female is unusual in that it has a scalloped black or brownish-black mantle and back; the dark feathers there are edged with white. This area appears a more uniform black as the plumage ages and the edges are worn away. Both sexes have black thighs.<ref name=Hig623/>

*The '''New Guinean Magpie''', ''C. tibicen papuana'', is a little-known subspecies found in southern [[New Guinea]].<ref name=Hig580/> The adult male has a mostly white back with a narrow black stripe, and the female a blackish back; the black feathers here are tipped with white similar to subspecies ''dorsalis''. It has a long deep bill resembling that of subspecies ''longirostris''.<ref name="black86">{{cite journal|last=Black A|date=1986|title=The Taxonomic Affinity of the New Guinean Magpie ''Gymnorhina tibicen papuana''|journal=Emu|volume=86|issue=2|pages=65&ndash;70|url=http://www.publish.csiro.au/paper/MU9860065.htm (abstract)|accessdate=2009-04-07|doi=10.1071/MU9860065}}</ref>

== Description ==
[[File:Australian Magpie Portrait.JPG|thumb|left|Immature, with dark irises and less distinct plumage, Iluka Nature Reserve, NSW]]
The adult magpie is a fairly solid, sturdy bird ranging from 37&ndash;43&nbsp;cm (14.5&ndash;17&nbsp;in) in length with a 65&ndash;85&nbsp;cm (26&ndash;33&nbsp;in) wingspan, and weighing 220&ndash;350&nbsp;g (8&ndash;12&nbsp;oz).<ref name=Hig580>Higgins ''et al.'', p. 580</ref> Its robust wedge-shaped bill is bluish-white bordered with black, with a small hook at the tip. The black legs are long and strong.<ref name=Hig618>Higgins ''et al.'', p. 618</ref> The plumage is pure glossy black and white; both sexes of all subspecies have black heads, wings and underparts with white shoulders. The tail has a black terminal band. The nape is white in the male and light greyish-white in the female. Mature magpies have dull red eyes, in contrast to the yellow eyes of currawongs and white eyes of Australian ravens and crows.<ref name=Hig581/> The main difference between the subspecies lies in the "saddle" markings on the back below the nape. Black-backed subspecies have a black saddle and white nape.<ref name=Hig580/> White-backed subspecies have a wholly white nape and saddle. The male Western Australian subspecies ''dorsalis'' is also white-backed, but the equivalent area in the female is scalloped black.<ref name=Hig581>Higgins ''et al.'', p. 581</ref> 

Juveniles have lighter greys and browns amidst the starker blacks and whites of their plumage;<ref name = "Simpsday">{{cite book | author = Simpson K, Day N, Trusler P  | title = Field Guide to the Birds of Australia | publisher = Viking O'Neil | date = 1993 | location = Ringwood, Victoria | page = 392 | isbn = 0-670-90478-3}}</ref> two or three year old birds of both sexes closely resemble and are difficult to distinguish from adult females.<ref name=Hig618/> Immature birds have dark brownish eyes until around two years of age.<ref name=Hig618/> Australian Magpies generally live to around 25&nbsp;years of age,<ref name = "Kapvii">Kaplan, p. vii</ref> though ages of up to 30&nbsp;years have been recorded.<ref>{{cite book |author=QNPWS (Queensland National Parks & Wildlife Service)|title=Living with Wildlife:The Magpie |year=1993 |publisher=Department of Environment and Heritage, Queensland |location=Brisbane |isbn= }}</ref> The reported age of first breeding has varied according to area, but the average is between the ages of three and five years.<ref name=Hig595>Higgins ''et al.'', p. 595</ref>

Well-known and easily recognisable, the Australian Magpie is unlikely to be confused with any other species. The [[Pied Butcherbird]] has a similar build and plumage, but has white underparts unlike the former species' black underparts. The [[Magpie-lark]] is a much smaller and more delicate bird with complex and very different banded black and white plumage. Currawong species have predominantly dark plumage and heavier bills.<ref name=Hig581/>

===Vocalisations===
One of Australia's most highly-regarded songbirds, the Australian Magpie has a wide variety of calls, many of which are complex. Pitch may vary over up to four octaves,<ref name=Hig605>Higgins ''et al.'', p. 605</ref> and the bird can mimic over 35 species of native and introduced bird species, as well as dogs and horses.<ref name=Hig606>Higgins ''et al.'', p. 606</ref> Its complex, musical, warbling call is one of the most familiar Australian bird sounds. In [[Denis Glover]]'s poem [[The Magpies]], the mature magpie's call is described as ''quardle oodle ardle wardle doodle''.<ref>{{cite book|author=Falla RA, Sibson RB, Turbott EG|title=A field guide to the birds of New Zealand|publisher=Collins|location=Auckland|date=1972|page=235|isbn=0-00-212022-4}}</ref>, one of the most famous lines in New Zealand poetry, and in the children's book ''Waddle Giggle Gargle'' by [[Pamela Allen]].<ref>Jones, p. viii</ref>

When alone, a magpie may make a quiet musical warbling; these complex melodious warbles or subsongs are pitched at 2&ndash;4&nbsp;K[[Hertz|Hz]] and do not carry for long distances. These songs have been recorded up to 70 minutes in duration and are more frequent after the end of the breeding season.<ref name=Kap111>Kaplan, p. 111</ref> Pairs of magpies often take up a loud musical calling known as ''carolling'' to advertise or defend their territory; one bird initiates the call with the second (and sometimes more) joining in.<ref name=Kap109>Kaplan, p. 109</ref> Often preceded by warbling,<ref name=Hig606/> carolling is pitched between 6&ndash;8&nbsp;kHz and has 4&ndash;5 elements with slurring indistinct noise in between.<ref name=Kap36>Kaplan, p. 36</ref> Birds will adopt a specific posture by tilting their heads back, expanding their chests, and moving their wings backwards.<ref name=Kap37>Kaplan, p. 37</ref> A group of magpies will sing a short repetitive version of carolling just before dawn (''dawn song''), and at twilight after sundown (''dusk song''), in winter and spring.<ref name=Hig606/>

Fledgling and juvenile magpies emit a repeated short and loud (80&nbsp;[[Decibel|dB]]), high-pitched (8&nbsp;kHz) begging call.<ref name=Kap76>Kaplan, p. 76</ref> Magpies may indulge in beak-clapping to warn other species of birds.<ref name=Kap107>Kaplan, p. 107</ref> They employ several high pitched (8&ndash;10&nbsp;kHz) alarm or rallying calls when intruders or threats are spotted. Distinct calls have been recorded for the approach of eagles and monitor lizards.<ref name=Kap110>Kaplan, p. 110</ref>

==Distribution and habitat==
The Australian Magpie is found in the Trans-Fly region of southern New Guinea, between the Oriomo River and the Princess Mariane Strait, and across most of Australia, bar the tip of [[Cape York Peninsula|Cape York]],<ref name=Hig583>Higgins ''et al.'', p. 583</ref> the [[Gibson Desert|Gibson]] and [[Great Sandy Desert]]s, and southwest of Tasmania.<ref name=Hig584>Higgins ''et al.'', p. 584</ref> Birds taken mainly from Tasmania and Victoria were introduced into [[New Zealand]] by local [[Acclimatisation society|Acclimatisation Societies]] of Otago and Canterbury in the 1860s, with the Wellington Acclimatisation Society releasing 260 birds in 1874. White-backed forms are spread on both the North and eastern South Island, while Black-backed forms are found in the [[Hawke's Bay]] region.<ref name=Long81>{{cite book |title=Introduced Birds of the World: The worldwide history, distribution and influence of birds introduced to new environments |last=Long |first=John L. |year=1981 |publisher=Reed |location=Terrey Hills, Sydney |isbn=0-589-50260-3|page=344}}</ref> Magpies were introduced into New Zealand to control agricultural pests, and were therefore a protected species until 1951.<ref name="NZEncyc">{{cite web|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/TheSettledLandscape/IntroducedPlantsAndAnimals/IntroducedLandBirds/6/mi|title=Introduced land birds: Australian Magpie|last=Troup|first=Christina|date=20 November 2008|work=Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand|publisher=Ministry for Culture & Heritage (New Zealand)|accessdate=2008-12-23}}</ref> They are thought to affect native New Zealand bird populations such as the [[tui (bird)|tui]] and [[kerer<U+016B>]], sometimes raiding nests for eggs and nestlings,<ref name="NZEncyc" /> although studies by [[Waikato University]] have cast doubt on this,<ref>{{cite journal|author=Morgan, D, Waas, J, Innes, J|date=2006|title=The relative importance of Australian magpies (''Gymnorhina tibicen'') as nest predators of rural birds in New Zealand|journal=New Zealand Journal of Zoology|volume=33|pages=17&ndash;29}}</ref> and much blame on the Magpie as a predator in the past has been anecdotal only.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Morgan D, Waas, J, Innes, J|date=2005|title=Do territorial and non-breeding Australian Magpies ''Gymnorhina tibicen'' influence the local movements of rural birds in New Zealand?|journal=Ibis|volume=148|issue=2|pages=330&ndash;42}}</ref> Introductions also occurred in the [[Solomon Islands]] and [[Sri Lanka]], although the species has failed to become established. It has become established in western [[Taveuni]] in [[Fiji]], however.<ref name=Long81/>

The Australian Magpie prefers open areas such as grassland, fields  and residential areas such as parks, gardens, golf courses, and streets, with scattered trees or forest nearby. Birds nest and shelter in trees but forage mainly on the ground in these open areas.<ref name=Hig582>Higgins ''et al.'', p. 582</ref> It has also been recorded in mature [[pine plantation]]s; birds only occupy rainforest and wet [[sclerophyll forest]] in the vicinity of cleared areas.<ref name="Hig583"/> In general, evidence suggests the range and population of the Australian Magpie has increased with land-clearing, although local declines in Queensland due to a 1902 drought, and in Tasmania in the 1930s have been noted; the cause for the latter is unclear but rabbit baiting, pine tree removal, and spread of the [[Masked Lapwing]] (''Vanellus miles'') have been implicated.<ref name=Hig585>Higgins ''et al.'', p. 585</ref>

== Behaviour ==
The Australian Magpie is almost exclusively [[diurnality|diurnal]], although it may call into the night, like some other members of the Artamidae.<ref name = "Kap25">Kaplan, p. 25</ref> Natural predators of magpies include various species of [[monitor lizard]] and the [[Barking Owl]].<ref name = "Kap512">Kaplan, pp. 51&ndash;52</ref> Birds have also been killed on roads or electrocuted by powerlines, or poisoned after killing and eating House Sparrows or mice, rats or rabbits targeted with baiting.<ref name=Hig587>Higgins ''et al.'', p. 587</ref> The [[Australian Raven]] may take nestlings left unattended.<ref name = "Kap51">Kaplan, p. 51</ref>

[[File:Gymnorhina tibicen (Magpie venturing inside).jpg|thumb|left|Displaying walking gait]]
On the ground, the Australian Magpie moves around by walking, and is the only member of the Artamidae to do so; woodswallows, butcherbirds and currawongs all tend to hop with legs parallel. The magpie has a short [[femur]] (thigh bone), and long lower leg below the knee, suited to walking rather than running, although birds can run in short bursts when hunting prey.<ref name=Kap1920>Kaplan, pp. 19&ndash;20</ref>

The magpie is generally sedentary and territorial throughout its range, living in groups occupying a territory, or in flocks or fringe groups. A group may occupy and defend the same territory for many years.<ref name=Hig587/> Much energy is spent defending a territory from intruders, particularly other magpies, and different behaviours are seen with different opponents. The sight of a [[bird of prey|raptor]] results in a rallying call by sentinel birds and subsequent coordinated mobbing of the intruder. Magpies place themselves either side of the bird of prey so that it will be attacked from behind should it strike a defender, and harass and drive the raptor to some distance beyond the territory.<ref name=Kap91>Kaplan, p. 91</ref> A group will use carolling as a signal to advertise ownership and warn off other magpies. In the ''negotiating display'', the one or two dominant magpies parade along the border of the defended territory while the rest of the group stand back a little and look on. The leaders may fluff their feathers or caroll repeatedly. In a ''group strength display'', employed if both the opposing and defending groups are of roughly equal numbers, all magpies will fly and form a row at the border of the territory.<ref name=Kap81>Kaplan, p. 81</ref> The defending group may also resort to an aerial display where the dominant magpies, or sometimes the whole group, swoop and dive while calling to warn an intruding magpie's group.<ref name=Kap82>Kaplan, p. 82</ref> 

[[File:Magpie inflight.jpg|thumb|right|Female, subsp.

===Feeding===
[[File:Tasmag1.JPG|thumb|Tasmanian subsecies being hand fed]]
The Australian Magpie is omnivorous, eating various items located at or near ground level including invertebrates such as [[earthworm]]s, [[millipede]]s, [[snail]]s, [[spider]]s and [[scorpion]]s as well as a wide variety of [[insect]]s&mdash;[[cockroach]]es, ants, beetles, moths and caterpillars and other larvae. [[Skink]]s, frogs, mice and other small animals as well as grain, tubers, figs and walnuts have also been noted as components of their diet.<ref>{{cite book |author=Barker RD, Vestkens WJM|title=Food of Australian Birds: Vol. 2 - Passerines |year=1990|pages=557|publisher= CSIRO|location= |isbn= }}</ref> It has even learnt to safely eat the poisonous [[cane toad]] by flipping it over and consuming the underparts.<ref name="SCU">{{cite web|url=http://www.scu.edu.au/news/media.php?item_id=1023&action=show_item&type=M|title=Birds learn to eat cane toads safely |last=Marchant|first=Gillian|date=26 November 2007|work=Southern Cross University website|publisher=Southern Cross University|accessdate=2009-05-09}}</ref> Predominantly a ground feeder, the Australian Magpie paces open areas methodically searching for insects and their larvae.<ref name = "Kap234">Kaplan, pp. 23&ndash;24</ref> One study showed birds were able to find [[Scarabaeidae|scarab beetle]] larvae by sound or vibration.<ref name ="Velt89">{{cite journal |author=Veltman CJ, Hickson RE |year=1989 |title=Predation by Australian magpies ''(Gymnorhina tibicen)'' on pasture invertebrates: are non-territorial birds less successful? |journal=Australian Journal of Ecology |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=319<U+2013>26 |doi= 10.1111/j.1442-9993.1989.tb01440.x}}</ref> Birds use their bills to probe into the earth or otherwise overturn debris in search of food.<ref name=Hig589>Higgins ''et al.'', p. 589</ref> Smaller prey are swallowed whole, although magpies rub off the stingers of bees and wasps before swallowing.<ref name=Hig590>Higgins ''et al.'', p. 590</ref>

===Breeding===
[[File:Magnest3.JPG|thumb|right|Nest in a [[banksia]] tree]]
Magpies have a long breeding season which varies in different parts of the country; in northern parts of Australia they will breed between June and September, but not commence until August or September in cooler regions, and may continue until January in some alpine areas.<ref name ="Kap48">Kaplan, p. 48</ref> The nest is a bowl-shaped structure made of sticks and lined with softer material such as grass and bark. Near human habitation, synthetic material may be incorporated.<ref name = "Beru03">{{cite book  | last = Beruldsen  | first = G  | title = Australian Birds: Their Nests and Eggs| publisher = self |date = 2003| location = Kenmore Hills, Qld| page = 373|isbn=0-646-42798-9}}</ref> Nests are built exclusively by females and generally placed high up in a tree fork, often in an exposed position.<ref name ="Kap4951">Kaplan, pp. 49&ndash;51</ref> The trees used are most commonly [[eucalypt]]s, although a variety of other native trees as well as introduced [[pine]], ''[[Crataegus]]'', and [[elm]] have been recorded.<ref name=Hig609>Higgins ''et al.'', p. 609</ref>  Other bird species, such as the [[Yellow-rumped Thornbill]] (''Acanthiza chrysorrhoa''), [[Willie Wagtail]] (''Rhipidura leucophrys''), [[Southern Whiteface]] (''Aphelocephala leucopsis''), and (less commonly) [[Noisy Miner]] (''Manorina melanocephala''), often nest in the same tree as the magpie. The first two species may even locate their nest directly beneath a magpie nest, while the diminutive [[Striated Pardalote]] (''Pardalotus striatus'') has been known to make a burrow for breeding into the base of the magpie nest itself. These incursions are all tolerated by the magpies.<ref name=Hig610>Higgins ''et al.'', p. 610</ref> The [[Channel-billed Cuckoo]]  (''Scythrops novaehollandiae'') is a notable brood parasite in eastern Australia; magpies will raise cuckoo young, which eventually outcompete the magpie nestlings.<ref>Kaplan, p. 53</ref>

[[Image:Gymnorhina tibicen, nesting.JPG|thumb|left|Western Magpie female ''(note scalloped back)'' collecting nesting material]]
The Australian Magpie produces a clutch of two to five light blue or greenish [[egg (biology)|egg]]s, which are oval in shape and about 27&nbsp;x&nbsp;38&nbsp;mm (1&nbsp;x&nbsp;1.5&nbsp;in).<ref name=Kap64>Kaplan, p. 64</ref> The chicks hatch synchronously around 20&nbsp;days after [[Avian incubation|incubation]] begins; like all [[passerine]]s, the chicks are [[altricial]]&mdash;they are born pink, naked, and blind with large feet, a short broad beak and a bright red throat. Their eyes are fully open at around 10 days. Chicks develop fine downy feathers on their head, back and wings in the first week, and pinfeathers in the second week. The black and white coloration is noticeable from an early stage.<ref>Kaplan, p. 66</ref> Nestlings are fed exclusively by the female, though the male magpie will feed his partner.<ref>Kaplan, p. 65</ref> The Australian Magpie is known to engage in [[cooperative breeding]], and helper birds will assist in feeding and raising young.<ref name=Hig595/> This does vary from region to region, and with the size of the group&mdash;the behaviour is rare or nonexistent in pairs or small groups.<ref name=Hig595/> 

Juvenile magpies begin foraging on their own three weeks after leaving the nest, and mostly feeding themselves by six months old. Some birds continue begging for food until eight or nine months of age, but are usually ignored. Birds reach adult size by their first year.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Population ecology of the Australian Black-backed Magpie, Royal Penguin, and Silver Gull |last=Carrick |first=Robert |year=1972 |journal=U S Dept Interior Res Report|volume=2|pages=41<U+2013>99}}</ref> The age at which young birds disperse varies across the country, and depends on the aggressiveness of the dominant adult of the corresponding sex; males are usually evicted at a younger age. Many leave at around a year old, but the age of departure may range from eight months to four years.<ref name=Hig596>Higgins ''et al.'', p. 596</ref>

==Relationship with humans==
=== Swooping ===
Magpies are ubiquitous in urban areas all over Australia, and have become accustomed to people. A small percentage of birds become highly aggressive during breeding season from late August to early October, and will swoop and sometimes attack passersby. The percentage has been difficult to estimate but is significantly less than 9%.<ref name=Jones37>Jones, p. 37</ref> Almost all attacking birds (around 99%) are male,<ref name=Jones38>Jones, p. 38</ref> and they are generally known to attack pedestrians at around 50&nbsp;m (150&nbsp;ft) from their nest, and cyclists at around 100&nbsp;m (300&nbsp;ft).<ref name=Jones3940>Jones, pp. 39&ndash;40</ref> Attacks begin as the eggs hatch, increase in frequency and severity as the chicks grow, and tail off as the chicks leave the nest.<ref name=Jones4344>Jones, pp. 43&ndash;44</ref>

These magpies may engage in an escalating series of behaviours to drive off intruders. Least threatening are alarm calls and distant swoops, where birds fly within several metres from behind and perch nearby. Next in intensity are close swoops, where a magpie will swoop in from behind or the side and audibly "snap" their beaks or even peck or bite at the face, neck, ears or eyes. More rarely, a bird may dive-bomb and strike the intruder's (usually a cyclist's) head with its chest. A magpie may rarely attack by landing on the ground in front of a person and lurching up and landing on the victim's chest and peck at the face and eyes.<ref name=Jones48>Jones, p. 48</ref>

Magpie attacks can cause injuries, typically wounds to the head and particularly the eyes, with potential detached retinas and bacterial infections from a beak used to [[Fossicking|fossick]] in the ground.<ref name=Jones52>Jones, p. 52</ref> A 13-year-old boy died from [[tetanus]], apparently from a magpie injury, in northern New South Wales in 1946.<ref name=Jones52/> Being unexpectedly swooped while cycling is not uncommon, and can result in loss of control of the bicycle, which may cause injury.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nisu.flinders.edu.au/pubs/shortreps/magpies.html |title=Injuries involving magpies |accessdate=2008-10-14 |last=Kreisfeld|first=Renate |date=9 October 1997 |work=Research Centre for Injury Studies |publisher=Flinders University, Adelaide}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bq.org.au/cycle-info/hazards.shtml |title=Hazards: Magpies |accessdate=2008-10-14 |date=2006 |work=Bicycle Queensland website |publisher=Bicycle Queensland}}</ref>

[[Image:Magpie chasing Brown Goshawk (Immature).jpg|thumb|right|A Magpie defending its territory from a [[Brown Goshawk]]]]

If it is necessary to walk near the nest, wearing a broad-brimmed or legionnaire's hat or using an umbrella will deter attacking birds, but beanies and bicycle helmets are of little value as birds attack the sides of the head and neck.<ref>Jones, p. 104</ref> Eyes painted on hats or helmets will deter attacks on pedestrians but not cyclists.<ref>Jones, pp. 105&ndash;06</ref> Attaching a long pole with a flag to a bike is an effective deterrent.<ref>Jones, pp. 106&ndash;07</ref> As of 2008, the use of cable ties on helmets has become common and appears to be effective.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bv.com.au/bikes-&-riding/10754/|title=Swooping birds |date=2008|work=Bicycle Victoria website|publisher=Bicycle Victoria |accessdate=2008-12-18}}</ref> Magpies prefer to swoop at the back of the head; therefore, keeping the magpie in sight at all times can discourage the bird.  Using a basic disguise to fool the magpie as to where a person is looking (such as painting eyes on a hat, or wearing sunglasses on the back of the head) can also prove effective. In some cases, magpies may become extremely aggressive and attack people's faces; it may become very difficult to deter these birds from swooping. Once attacked, shouting aggressively and waving one's arms at the bird should deter a second attack. If a bird presents a serious nuisance the local authorities may arrange for that bird to be legally destroyed, or more commonly, to be caught and translocated to an unpopulated area.<ref> {{cite journal|title=Management of aggressive Australian magpies by translocation|journal=Wildlife Research|date=|first=Darryl N.|last=Jones|coauthors=Thomas Nealson |volume=30|issue=2|pages=167&ndash;77 |doi= 10.1071/WR01102|url=|format=|accessdate= }}</ref> Magpies have to be moved some distance as almost all are able to find their way home from distances of less than 25&nbsp;km.<ref>Jones, p. 119</ref> Removing the nest is of no use as birds will simply breed again and possibly be more aggressive the second time around.<ref>Jones, p. 115</ref>

Magpies are a protected native species in Australia, so it is illegal to kill or harm them.  However, this protection is removed in some Australian States if a magpie attacks a human, allowing for the bird to be destroyed if it is considered particularly aggressive (such a provision is made, for example, in section 54 of the South Australian National Parks and Wildlife Act).<ref name="urlwww.legislation.sa.gov.au">{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.sa.gov.au/LZ/C/A/NATIONAL%20PARKS%20AND%20WILDLIFE%20ACT%201972/CURRENT/1972.56.UN.PDF |title=South Australia National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972 |format=PDF |work=SA Government website|publisher=Government of South Australia |accessdate=2009-04-14}}</ref> 
It is claimed by some that swooping can be prevented by hand-feeding magpies. The idea is that humans thereby appear less of a threat to the nesting birds. This has not been studied systematically, although there are reports of its success.<ref>Jones, p. 103</ref>
