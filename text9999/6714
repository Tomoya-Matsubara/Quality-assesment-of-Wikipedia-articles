The ''Post'' added, "The ability of a single e-mail to shape a message illustrates the power of the conservative network." The article described Erickson as one of the American conservative movement's "key national players".<ref>Markon, Jerry, [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/31/AR2010013102860.html "New media help conservatives get their anti-Obama message out"], February 1, 2010, ''Washington Post'', retrieved May 30, 2010</ref>

==CNN contributor==
On March 16, 2010, CNN announced the hiring of Erickson as a political contributor to ''[[John King, USA]]''.  CNN Political Director Sam Feist called Erickson "a perfect fit for ''John King, USA'', because not only is he an agenda-setter whose words are closely watched in Washington, but as a person who still lives in small-town America, Erick is in touch with the very people John hopes to reach.<U+201D><ref>Martel, Francis, [http://www.mediaite.com/online/red-states-erick-erickson-relocating-to-john-king-usa/], March 16, 2010, "Mediaite.com", retrieved August 28, 2010</ref>  On his blog, Erickson stated, "CNN made an offer I couldn<U+2019>t refuse," and added, "This is the path God put me on and it was totally unexpected, but I go where the good Lord leads."<ref>Erickson, Erick, [http://www.redstate.com/erick/2010/03/16/heres-my-news-erick-erickson-joins-cnn<U+2019>s-roster-of-political-contributors/], March 16, 2010, "Redstate.com", retrieved August 28, 2010</ref>

==Nikki Haley gubernatorial bid==
In May 2010, Erickson wrote in the RedState blog that he would be releasing evidence that Will Folks, a South Carolina GOP political operative, had made false allegations that he had an affair with gubernatorial candidate [[Nikki Haley]] and that the allegations were "initiated by a rival political campaign.".<ref>{{cite web|last=Erickson |first=Erick |url=http://www.redstate.com/erick/2010/05/28/naming-names/ |title=Naming Names |publisher=RedState |date=May 28, 2010 |accessdate=April 7, 2012}}</ref> Later that day, Erickson wrote, "I have no clue if anyone is behind Will Folks doing this. [...] With apologies to RedState readers, [...] I<U+2019>ve had no hesitation in stringing the media along like Folks has done."<ref>Erickson, Erick, [http://www.redstate.com/erick/2010/05/28/letting-the-chips-fall-where-they-may/ "Letting the Chips Fall Where They May ], 1:54 p.m. EDT, May 28, Redstate blog, retrieved May 30, 2010</ref><ref name=by0530>York, Byron, [http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/blogs/beltway-confidential/scandal-south-carolina-politics-and-the-erick-erickson-hoax-95213344.html "Scandal, South Carolina politics, and the Erick Erickson hoax"], 8 a.m., May 30, 2010, Beltway Confidential blog, ''Washington Examiner'' website, retrieved same day</ref> [[Byron York]], a conservative journalist, criticized Erickson: "[S]acrificing your own credibility in an effort to undermine someone else<U+2019>s is not a good idea, and what Erickson has done has surely hurt both his own reputation and that of his website."<ref name=by0530/>

==George Allen 2012 Senate bid==
In 2011 Democrat [[Jim Webb]], the senior [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] from Virginia, announced that he would not seek re-election in 2012.  Republican [[George Allen (U.S. politician)|George Allen]] announced that he would try to win back the seat that he [[United States Senate election in Virginia, 2006|lost to Webb in 2006]], but Erickson declined to endorse the "establishment" Allen, complaining of Allen's voting record.  Erickson stated that he had "decided to support ([[Tea Party movement|Tea Party]] organizer) [[Jamie Radtke]] for the Senate."<ref>Erick Erickson [http://www.redstate.com/erick/2011/01/24/george-allens-problem/ George Allen<U+2019>s Problem] ''[[RedState.com]]'' January 24, 2011</ref>  In August, however, Erickson approvingly quoted anonymous commentators who alleged that when Radtke spoke at a Redstate gathering she was a "drunk rambling idiot."<ref>Erick Erickson [http://www.redstate.com/erick/2011/08/24/regarding-jamie-radtke/ Regarding Jamie Radtke] ''[[RedState.com]]'' August 24, 2011</ref>  According to an email sent earlier by Erickson to the Radtke campaign and forwarded to [[Ben Smith (journalist)|Ben Smith]], Erickson admitted having revised his public opinion about Radtke because "my bosses are huge Allen friends."<ref>Ben Smith [http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0811/Publishers_social_ties_pushed_RedState_toward_Allen.html Publisher's 'social' ties pushed RedState toward Allen] ''[[Politico (newspaper)|Politico]]'' August 24, 2011</ref>  Smith had previously raised questions about Erickson's independence from the financial interests of his employer by noting that an official with RedState.com's publisher had sent out an email that appeared to be selling Erickson's endorsement.<ref>Ben Smith [http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0811/Publishers_social_ties_pushed_RedState_toward_Allen.html RedState sells 'endorsement'] ''[[Politico (newspaper)|Politico]]'' June 11, 2011</ref>
