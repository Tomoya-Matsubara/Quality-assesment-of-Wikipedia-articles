[[Randolph, Tennessee|Randolph]] is an [[unincorporated area|unincorporated]] rural community in [[Tipton County, Tennessee|Tipton County]], 
[[Tennessee]], [[United States]], located on the banks of the [[Mississippi River]]. 

The lands of the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi River Basin]] were inhabited by [[Paleo-Indians]] and later [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes of the [[Mississippian culture]] for thousands of years. The [[Chickasaw]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian tribe]] populated the Mississippi River valley when [[Europe]]an explorers first arrived on the [[North America|North American continent]]. In 1541, [[Spanish people|Spanish]] [[Exploration|explorer]] [[Hernando de Soto]] crossed the Mississippi River at or near Randolph. [[French people|French]] explorer [[Ren<U+00E9>-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle|Cavelier de La Salle]] built the first French fortification at or near Randolph on his 1682 canoe expedition of the Mississippi River.

European [[settler]]s arrived in the area around 1800. The town of Randolph was founded in the 1820s as one of the earliest European settlements in Tipton County. The location of Randolph, on the second [[Chickasaw Bluff]] along the banks of the [[Mississippi River]], just south of the lower mouth of the [[Hatchie River]], provided for an ideal harbor for [[flatboat]]s and [[steamboat]]s and made the town an early center of river commerce in [[West Tennessee]]. Randolph shipped more [[cotton]] annually than [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] until 1840. The commercial success of the community also depended on the use of [[Slavery|slave]] labor in the cotton fields surrounding the settlement. In 1827, the Randolph [[Post office]] was established and in 1834, the first [[pastor]] was appointed at Randolph.

The fortunes of the community began to decline in the late 1840s due to failed [[Rail transport|railroad]] development, an unfavorable mail route and an unsuccessful attempt to move the [[county seat]] from [[Covington, Tennessee|Covington]] to Randolph. An unfinished project to cut a [[canal]] from the [[Hatchie River]] to the [[Tennessee River]] and other factors also contributed to the commercial demise of the town. The first [[Confederate States Army]] [[Fortification|fort]] in Tennessee was built at Randolph early in the [[American Civil War]] in 1861, a second fortification at Randolph was constructed later that same year. During the Civil War, the town was burned down twice by [[Union Army]] forces, which further promoted the decline of the once flourishing community.

In 2008, ''Randolph Bluff Historic Park'' was dedicated. The park is intended to promote the Civil War history of the community and make the unique views of the Mississippi River available to a wider public. Once finished, the park will be part of the Mississippi River Corridor Tennessee, a project to "create a scenic byway that connects historic sites along the Mississippi River". As of 2008, Randolph has a population of ca. 200 and consists of about two dozen dwellings. The economy of the rural community is dominated by [[agriculture]] with no major industries and businesses present.

[[Image:De Soto Discovers Mississippi BAH-p20.png|thumb|[[Hernando de Soto|De Soto's]] first view of the [[Mississippi River]]]]
[[Hernando de Soto]] (c. 1496&ndash;1542) was a [[Spanish people|Spanish]] [[Exploration|explorer]] who led the first European expedition deep into the territory of the modern United States and the first European documented to have discovered the [[Mississippi River]].<ref name=EBdeSoto>{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/555096/Hernando-de-Soto |title=Hernando de Soto - Britannica Online Encyclopedia |accessdate=2008-10-23 |publisher= Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica}}</ref>

In 1541, De Soto and 400 men reached the Mississippi River in the area of what is modern [[Shelby County, Tennessee|Shelby County]] in southwest Tennessee or [[DeSoto County, Mississippi|DeSoto County]] in northwest [[Mississippi]]. Within four weeks of their arrival, the expedition had built several floats in order to cross the river and continue their expedition westward into what would later become [[Arkansas]] territory. There is a documented controversy about the exact location of Hernando de Soto's crossing over the Mississippi River. A report published in 1874 suggests that "De Soto (...) traveled up to Randolph, and there built boats and crossed the river".<ref>{{cite book |title=First and Second Reports of the Bureau of Agriculture for the State of Tennessee: Introduction to the Resources of Tennessee |last=Killebrew |first=Joseph Buckner |others=Tennessee Bureau of Agriculture |year=1874 |publisher=Tavel, Eastman & Howell |location=[[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], [[Tennessee]] |page=1170 }}</ref> Other documentations claim that it is "generally believed and (...) probably true" that De Soto crossed the Mississippi River at [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wdbj.net/shelby/goodspeed/history/history1.htm |title=Goodspeed's History of Shelby County, Tennessee (1887) |accessdate=2008-10-08 |work=Shelby County, Tennessee Genealogy & History |publisher=TNGenWeb Project }}</ref><ref name=PhelanHoT>

[[Ren<U+00E9>-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle]] (1643&ndash;87) was a [[French people|French]] explorer. In 1682, La Salle led a [[canoe]] expedition to explore the Mississippi River basin. The expedition landed to hunt, when one of their members went missing. The [[Armourer|armorer]] Pierre Prudhomme was assumed captured by [[Chickasaw]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Indians]]. La Salle decided to stay and search for the missing member.

==European settlement==
Around 1800, [[European ethnic groups|Europeans]] began settling the land east of the [[Mississippi River]] that was inhabited by the [[Chickasaw]] Indians for centuries prior to the arrival of Europeans. Chickasaw land in [[West Tennessee]] and southwestern [[Kentucky]] was ceded in the [[Jackson Purchase (U.S. historical region)|Jackson Purchase]] after negotiations in which the United States was represented by General [[Andrew Jackson]] and Governor [[Isaac Shelby]], while the Chickasaw were represented by their chiefs and warriors.<ref name=KYency>{{cite web |url=http://www.utm.edu/departments/acadpro/library/departments/special_collections/wc_hist/jackpur.htm |title=Jackson Purchase |accessdate=2008-10-24 |publisher=excerpt from the The Kentucky Encyclopedia edited by John E.

Early European landowners were eager to secure their investment in land in southwest Tennessee. Years before Randolph would be founded, wealthy and influential investors tried to find ways to get a return on their share of land. In 1818, Judge [[John Overton (judge)|John Overton]] wrote to General [[James Winchester]] that "We must not let the owners of the property on the Bluffs at the Mississippi above us be beforehand in laying off town&mdash;as it might damp the sale of ours".<ref name=CAmem>

Both Memphis and Randolph are located on one of the four [[Chickasaw Bluff]]s, Randolph on the second and Memphis on the fourth. In the early 1800s, the terrain of the Chickasaw Bluffs provided promising locations for a harbor on the Mississippi River for both emerging towns. In 1820, the area that would become Randolph had an estimated population of 54.<ref name=TNfroniersFinger>

===Establishment===
[[Image:Steamboat Enterprise 1815 cropped.jpg|thumb|[[Mississippi River]] [[Steamboats of the Mississippi|steamboat]]]]
Early in the 1820s, landowners and investors John T. Brown and Robert Bedford were the proprietors of the land on the second [[Chickasaw Bluff]] that would form Randolph a few years later. Only {{convert|40|-|50|mi|km|-1|lk=on}} north of [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] by water, they described the area as "a good landing for Mississippi River flatboats". The [[Hatchie River]], joining the Mississippi River just north of the second Chickasaw Bluff, was accessible to [[Steamboats of the Mississippi|steamboats]] for {{convert|60|mi|km|-1}} upriver to [[Bolivar, Tennessee|Bolivar]], in [[Hardeman County, Tennessee|Hardeman County]]. Brown and Bedford chose the site on the second Chickasaw Bluff to lay out the plan for Randolph, a promising river town.<ref name=CAmem/>

Located on the banks of the Mississippi River on the second [[Chickasaw Bluff]], the [[topology]] of Randolph provided for an ideal harbor for steamboats and [[flatboat]]s at all stages of the river. Randolph became the center of [[Steamboats of the Mississippi|steamboat]] commerce in Tennessee and an important [[cotton]] shipping point in the 1830s.

</ref> In the mid 1830s, Randolph shipped 35,000 to 40,000 bales of cotton on the Mississippi River every year, in 1839 cotton shipments added up to 20,000 to 25,000 bales. More cotton was shipped from Randolph than from Memphis until 1840. At the peak of its commercial success, the community was called the "great steamboat depot of [[West Tennessee]]".<ref name=TNencyclopedia/><ref name=PhelanHoT/>

By 1829, Randolph had three commission warehouses, six dry goods stores, ten physicians and one [[tavern]]; 20 to 30 families were making their living in the area around Randolph.<ref name=CAmem/> Early in the 1830s, the town developed quickly. Randolph had a population of approximately 1,000 people in 1834. By that time, the town had four [[hotel]]s, almost fifty businesses, one of them a [[Distillation|distillery]], several private [[school]]s, and more than ten [[Western saloon|saloons]].<ref name=TNencyclopedia/><ref name=CAmem/>

In the 1830s, two newspapers were published in Randolph, the ''Randolph Recorder'' and the ''Randolph Whig''. The ''Randolph Recorder'' was founded in 1834 by F. S. Latham, and continued business until 1836.<ref name=PhelanHoT/><ref name=TSLAmicro>{{cite web |url=http://www.tennessee.gov/tsla/history/newspapers/paper-r.htm |title=Newspapers on Microfilm at TSLA |accessdate=2008-10-08 |publisher=Tennessee State Library and Archives }}</ref> The first issue of the ''Randolph Recorder'' was published on June 21, 1834, and the last publication of the newspaper dates to September 23, 1836.<ref name=TSLAmicro/><ref name=RunawaySlave>{{Cite web |url=http://spiny.com/runaway/ |title=Runaway Slave Blog |accessdate=15 January 2009 |work=Transcription of microfilm documents, incl. the Randolph Recorder (1834-1836) |publisher=Naomi Van Tol |date=2006}}</ref> The ''Randolph Whig'' was established either late in 1836 or early in 1837 and published its first issue on January 6, 1838.<ref name=PhelanHoT/><ref name=TSLAmicro/> The ''Randolph Whig'' did not last long. Shortly after its establishment, the publication "was soon discontinued".<ref name=PhelanHoT/>

"Some time in the thirties" of the 19th century, the first bank was founded in Randolph. A [[stagecoach]] line, established in 1833 by James Brown, provided a connection between Randolph and [[Jackson, Tennessee|Jackson]] in [[Madison County, Tennessee|Madison County]], located {{convert|70|mi|km|-1|lk=on}} east of Randolph. The stagecoach line offered a convenient alternative for travellers between the two towns and connected the villages along the way twice a week.<ref name=PhelanHoT/> Heading west from Jackson, the [[antebellum]] stage line roughly [[Concurrency (road)|concurs]] with modern [[U.S. Route 70]] up to [[Brownsville, Tennessee|Brownsville]] and [[List of state routes in Tennessee|Tennessee State Route 54]] from Brownsville to [[Covington, Tennessee|Covington]].

===Slavery===
A good part of the commercial success of Randolph can be attributed to the use of slaves working the cotton fields of the area for their owners. [[Slavery]] was common in the [[Southern States]] in the time before and during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. Landowners who ran [[plantation]]s on their lands, bought slaves to work their fields, mostly for the [[Tillage|cultivation]] of [[cotton]]. [[maize|Corn]], [[bean]]s and [[pea]]s were also cultivated.<ref name=McLeanBoykin>{{cite web |url=http://www.mchistory.org/blackHistory/boykin.html |title=McLean County Museum of History - Robert & Lillian Boykin (Transcription of Oral History)|accessdate=2009-01-21 |last=Pratt |first=Mildred |date=13 January, 1986 |publisher=McLean County Museum of History, [[Bloomington, Illinois|Bloomington]], [[Illinois]]}}</ref> In the ''Randolph Recorder'' during the early 1830s, landowners announced public auctions of slaves they owned. For the capture and return of runaway slaves, plantation owners offered [[Monetary policy|monetary]] incentives between $10 and $100. Rewards up to $300 were offered for the return of a stolen slave if the thief of the slave could be convicted of the theft. The [[Tipton County, Tennessee|Tipton County]] jail also published "jailer's notices" in the Randolph Recorder to inform owners of a slave of their [[incarceration]].<ref name=RunawaySlave/>

The fortunes of Randolph declined in the later 1840s and the 1850s due to many factors, starting shortly after the establishment of the town. Five years after the settlement was founded, a dispute over the ownership of the land the town was established on, arose over a faulty [[Land registration|land title]] with land owner Ann Grambelling from [[New York]].<ref name=TNencyclopedia/><ref name=CAmem/> Until 1835, the pending lawsuit "prevented the growth of population" in and around Randolph.<ref name=PhelanHoT/> The residents of the community bought back the land their town was founded on for $8,000 in a settlement.<ref name=TNencyclopedia/><ref name=CAmem/>

An unfavorable mail line also had an early and lasting influence on the fortunes of the town. When the mail route was established in 1829, it went from [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] to [[Jackson, Tennessee|Jackson]], [[Bolivar, Tennessee|Bolivar]], [[Somerville, Tennessee|Somerville]], [[Raleigh, Memphis|Raleigh]] and ended in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], but Randolph was left out.<ref name=TNencyclopedia/><ref name=CAmem/> Randolph was put at the end of a branch route of the mail line and received mail only once a week.<ref name=MEMRegion>{{cite web |title=memphisRegion.com - History of the region |url=http://www.memphisregion.com/pdf/Mem09_His+Inf.pdf |accessdate=October 11 |accessyear=2008}}</ref> Failed [[Rail transport|railroad]] development further contributed to the demise of the town; and in 1852, residents of Randolph unsuccessfully tried to move the county seat from [[Covington, Tennessee|Covington]] to Randolph.<ref name=TNencyclopedia/><ref name=CAmem/> The attempt to move the county seat to Randolph was defeated "by a bare majority of voters".<ref name=PhelanHoT/>

Financial depression and [[Davy Crockett|David Crockett]]'s failed attempt to cut a canal from the [[Hatchie River]] to the [[Tennessee River]] also were problems that had a negative impact on the future of commercial prosperity in Randolph.<ref name=TNencyclopedia/><ref name=TNMarkers/> Early in the Civil War, in March 1862, the town of Randolph is described as consisting of "half a dozen or so dilapidated frame houses".<ref name=NYTFtRandolph>{{cite news |first=A.

[[Fort Randolph (Tennessee)|Fort Randolph]], the second Confederate stronghold in the area during the Civil War, was constructed only months after Fort Wright, in Fall 1861.<ref name=NYTFtRandolph/> The fortification was situated on the Mississippi River bluffs, about {{convert|1|mi|km|lk=on}} southwest of Fort Wright.<ref name=eachTown>{{cite web |url=http://www.eachtown.com/place.php/id/1646819 |title=Tennessee Places, Fort Randolph (historical) |accessdate=2008-10-07 |publisher=eachTown.com }}</ref> 

In a dispatch published by the [[The New York Times|New York Times]] in March 1862, Fort Randolph is described as a "rough and incomplete earthwork (...) more than 100 feet above the river". The position of the fortification allowed a view of the Mississippi River for {{convert|6|mi|km|0}}, both upstream and downstream. Boats approaching the fort on the river could be detected early from this strong position.<ref name=NYTFtRandolph/> Confederate troops at the garrison could prepare for naval attacks on the fort and [[Union Army]] supply boats passing on the Mississippi River could be attacked from the elevated position of Fort Randolph without much risk of immediate retaliation. In 2008, Fort Randolph is no longer in existence.

In 1862, Union Army [[Major General]] [[William Tecumseh Sherman|William T. Sherman]] (1820&ndash;91) and his troops assumed control of the defeated Confederate stronghold of [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] and the surrounding areas, including the region of Randolph, located about {{convert|25|mi|km}} north of Memphis by land. While trying to keep the area under Union control, Sherman became increasingly "frustrated by the constant guerrilla activity in his sector". Confederate [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrillas]] from the Randolph area weakened the Union forces, raiding their supplies and firing at boats that delivered cargo to the invading forces along the Mississippi River.<ref name=GrimsleyHardHandOfWar>{{cite book

The Union supply ship ''Eugene'' was fired at by Confederate rebels on the Mississippi River at the second [[Chickasaw Bluff]], while carrying supplies to Memphis in September 1862. Major General Sherman ordered [[Colonel]] Charles C. Walcutt of the 46th Ohio Volunteer Infantry to Randolph. He informed his subordinate officer that "the attack on the ''Eugene'' was by a small force of guerrillas from Loosahatchie, who by this time have gone back, and therefore you will find no one at Randolph" (emphasis in the original). Although he could not get hold of the snipers, Sherman was determined to punish those who helped them, thus sealing the fate of Randolph. Sherman instructed Walcutt to "destroy the place, leaving one house to mark the place". Union Army soldiers under Colonel Walcutt's command burned down Randolph in retaliation for the guerrilla activities emerging from the area. To his superior officer, [[General officer|General]] [[Ulysses S. Grant]], Sherman reported that he had "given public notice that a repetition [of guerrilla attacks] will justify any measures of retaliation, such as loading the boats with guerrilla prisoners where they would receive fire".<ref name=HistNetSherman/> In 1869, Ulysses S.

The retribution for a [[military]] or [[paramilitary]] attack, by [[collective punishment]] of innocent [[civilian]]s at Randolph, has been mentioned as an early scene of Sherman's "terror campaign" or named his "First Campaign of Destruction" in the [[Southern States]].<ref name=LorenzoCiv>{{cite web |url=http://www.lewrockwell.com/dilorenzo/dilorenzo8.html |title=Targeting Civilians |accessdate=2009-01-19 |last=Prof. DiLorenzo |first=Thomas J. |coauthors= |date=2001 |work=Thomas DiLorenzo Archives |publisher=LewRockwell.com}}</ref><ref name=HistNetSherman/> Subsequent Union Army attacks, [[Hostage crisis|hostage takings]] and [[Capital punishment|executions]] of civilians in other southern communities led by Sherman were intended to break Confederate resistance in the South.<ref name=LorenzoCiv/> Sherman argued that residents in areas of Confederate resistance were "accessories by their presence and inactivity to prevent murders and destruction of property", thus potentially exposed to retaliation.<ref name=HistNetSherman/> Union Army actions under Sherman's command have been criticized as examples of [[war crime]]s committed in the [[United States]] during the [[Presidency]] of [[Abraham Lincoln]].<ref name=LorenzoCiv/>

==Modern history==
[[Image:Nutbush tennessee cotton.jpg|thumb|Modern [[cotton]] processing in West Tennessee (2006)]]
[[Agriculture]] is the dominant source of income in the area surrounding Randolph, especially the [[cultivation]] of [[cotton]]. [[maize|Corn]], [[bean]]s and [[pea]]s were also cultivated during the last century.<ref name=McLeanBoykin/> After the [[Abolitionism|abolition of slavery]] in 1865,<ref name=LOC13Amnd/> [[sharecropping]] was the primary means of income for low income families in the area. Mostly for the [[Tillage|cultivation]] of [[cotton]], land would be used by sharecroppers in return for a share of the crop to the landowner. Modern machines such as the [[cotton picker]] have made the manual [[Tillage|cultivation]] obsolete over time as they took over the work from the [[manual labour|hand laborers]].

On October 11, 2008, the Tennessee Parks and Greenways Foundation, a [[non-profit organization]], dedicated Randolph Bluff Historic Park in a celebration with [[politician]]s, [[Conservation movement|conservationists]], [[historian]]s and community members. The {{convert|19|acre|ha|0|lk=on}} property on the second Chickasaw Bluff was purchased for $378,000. The park is intended to promote the Civil War history of the community and make the unique views of the Mississippi River available to a wider public, additional revenue from tourism is expected for the community. Once ''Randolph Bluff Historic Park'' is finished, it will be part of the Mississippi River Corridor Tennessee, a project to "create a scenic byway that connects historic sites along the Mississippi River", the project also promotes economical development and the preservation of land and wildlife in the Tennessee counties bordering the Mississippi River.<ref name=CAmemPark>{{cite web |url=http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/2008/oct/10/nonprofit-dedicates-randolph-park/ |title=Tennessee Parks and Greenways Foundation dedicates Randolph Bluff Historic Park in Tipton County |accessdate=2008-10-11 |publisher=[[The Commercial Appeal]], [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], [[Tennessee]] }}</ref><ref name=RiverfrontMEM>{{cite web |url=http://www.friendsforourriverfront.org/2009/01/randolph-2nd-chickasaw-bluff-protected.html |title=Friends of Our Riverfront: Randolph - 2nd Chickasaw Bluff Protected & Dedicated as a Park |accessdate=2009-01-21 |publisher=Friends of Our Riverfront, [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], [[Tennessee]] |date=13 January, 2009 }}</ref>
