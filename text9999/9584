[[File:Kokin Wakashu Genei.jpg|thumb|right|The ''[[Kokin Wakash<U+016B>]]'' is generally regarded as the definitive anthology of ''waka'' poetry.]]

{{nihongo|'''''Waka'''''|<U+548C><U+6B4C>||literally, "Japanese poem"}} is a type of poetry in classical [[Japanese literature]]. ''Waka'' are composed in [[Japanese language|Japanese]], and are contrasted with poetry composed by Japanese poets in [[Classical Chinese]], which are known as [[kanshi (poetry)|''kanshi'']]. Although ''waka'' in modern Japanese is written as <U+548C><U+6B4C>, in the past it was also written as <U+502D><U+6B4C> (see ''[[Wa (Japan)]]''), and a variant name is {{nihongo|''yamato-uta''|<U+5927><U+548C><U+6B4C>}}.

==Etymology==
The word ''waka'' has two different but related meanings: the original meaning was "poetry in Japanese" and encompassed several genres such as ''ch<U+014D>ka'' and ''sed<U+014D>ka'' (discussed below); the later, more common definition refers to poetry in a [[tanka|5-7-5-7-7 metre]]. Up to and during the compilation of the ''[[Man'y<U+014D>sh<U+016B>]]'' in the eighth century, the word ''waka'' was a general term for poetry composed in Japanese, and included several genres such as {{nihongo|''tanka''|<U+77ED><U+6B4C>||"short poem"}}, {{nihongo|''ch<U+014D>ka''|<U+9577><U+6B4C>||"long poem"}}, {{nihongo|''bussokusekika''|<U+4ECF><U+8DB3><U+77F3><U+6B4C>||"[[Buddha footprint]] poem"}} and {{nihongo|''sed<U+014D>ka''|<U+65CB><U+982D><U+6B4C>||"repeating-the-first-part poem"}}. However, by the time of the ''[[Kokinsh<U+016B>]]'''s compilation at the beginning of the tenth century, all of these forms except for the ''tanka'' and ''ch<U+014D>ka'' had effectively gone extinct, and ''ch<U+014D>ka'' had significantly diminished in prominence. As a result, the word ''waka'' became effectively synonymous with ''tanka'', and the word ''tanka'' fell out of use until it was revived at the end of the nineteenth century (see ''[[Tanka]]'').

''Tanka'' (hereafter referred to as ''waka'') consist of five {{nihongo|lines|<U+53E5>|ku|literally "phrases"}} of 5-7-5-7-7 [[on (Japanese prosody)|''on'']] or syllabic units.

==Other forms of waka==
The term ''waka'' originally encompassed a number of differing forms, principally {{nihongo|'''tanka'''|<U+77ED><U+6B4C>|"short poem"}} and {{nihongo|'''ch<U+014D>ka'''|<U+9577><U+6B4C>|"long poem"}}, but also including [[bussokusekika]], {{nihongo|'''sed<U+014D>ka'''|<U+65CB><U+982D><U+6B4C>|"memorized poem"}}<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/309916/Kakinomoto-Hitomaro?anchor=ref50358 Kakinomoto Hitomaro] on Brittanica.com</ref> and {{nihongo|'''katauta'''|<U+7247><U+6B4C>|"poem fragment"}}. These last three forms, however, fell into disuse at the beginning of the [[Heian period]], and ''ch<U+014D>ka'' vanished soon afterwards. Thus, the term ''waka'' came in time to refer only to ''tanka''.<ref name=sh_wright>[http://simplyhaiku.com/SHv4n1/features/Wright.html Wright, Harold.

[English translation by [[Edwin Cranston]]]

In the early [[Heian period]] (at the beginning of the 10th century), ch<U+014D>ka was seldom written and tanka became the main form of waka. Since then, the generic term ''waka'' came to be almost synonymous with tanka. Famous examples of such works are the diaries of [[Ki no Tsurayuki]] and [[Izumi Shikibu]], as well as such collections of poem tales as ''[[The Tales of Ise]]'' and ''[[Yamato Monogatari|The Tales of Yamato]]''.

===Minor forms of ''waka''===
Lesser forms of ''waka'' featured in the ''Man'y<U+014D>sh<U+016B>'' and other ancient sources exist. Besides that, there were many other forms like:
*''[[Bussokusekika]]'': This form carved on a slab of slate <U+2013> the "Buddha footprint" or ''bussokuseki'' <U+2013> at the [[Yakushi-ji]] temple in [[Nara, Nara|Nara]]. Also recorded in the ''[[Man'y<U+014D>sh<U+016B>]]''. The pattern is 5-7-5-7-7-7.
*''Sed<U+014D>ka'': The ''[[Man'y<U+014D>sh<U+016B>]]'' and ''[[Kokinsh<U+016B>]]'' recorded this form. The pattern is 5-7-7-5-7-7.
*''Katauta'': Man'y<U+014D>sh<U+016B> recorded this form. ''Katauta'' means "half-poem". The pattern is 5-7-7.

==History==
Tanka has a long history, first recorded in the early 8th century in the [[Kojiki]] and [[Man'y<U+014D>sh<U+016B>]]. Under influence from other genres such as kanshi, Chinese poetry, novels and stories such as ''[[Tale of Genji]]'' and even Western poetry, it has developed gradually, broadening its repertoire of expression and topics.

In literary historian [[Donald Keene]]'s books, he uses four large categories:
#Early and Heian Literature ([[Kojiki]] to past ''[[The Tale of Genji]]'' to 1185)
#The Middle Ages ('ch<U+016B>sei' from 1185, including the [[Kamakura period|Kamakura]] and [[Muromachi period]]s)
#Pre-Modern Era (1600<U+2013>1867, then subdivided into 1600<U+2013>1770 and 1770<U+2013>1867)
#Modern Era (post 1867, divided into [[Meiji period|Meiji]] (1868<U+2013>1912), [[Taish<U+014D> period|Taish<U+014D>]] (1912<U+2013>1926) and [[Sh<U+014D>wa period|Sh<U+014D>wa]] (from 1927)).
===Ancient===
===Ancient===
The most ancient waka were recorded in the historical record the ''[[Kojiki]]'' and the 20 volumes of the ''[[Man'y<U+014D>sh<U+016B>]]'', the oldest surviving waka anthology. The editor of the ''[[Man'y<U+014D>sh<U+016B>]]'' is [[anonymous work|anonymous]], but it is believed that the final editor was [[<U+014C>tomo no Yakamochi]]. He was a waka poet who belonged to the youngest generation represented in the anthology; indeed, the last volume is dominated by his poems. The first waka of volume 1 was by [[Emperor <U+014C>jin]]. [[Princess Nukata|Nukata no <U+014C>kimi]], [[Kakinomoto no Hitomaro]], [[Yamabe no Akahito]], [[Yamanoue no Okura]], [[<U+014C>tomo no Tabito]] and his son Yakamochi were the greatest poets in this anthology. The [[Man'y<U+014D>sh<U+016B>]] recorded not only the works of the royalty and nobility, but also works of soldiers and farmers whose names were not recorded. The main topics of the [[Man'y<U+014D>sh<U+016B>]] were love, sadness (especially on the occasion of someone's death), and other miscellaneous topics.

===Classical===
===Heian revival===
During the Nara period and the early Heian period, the court favored Chinese-style poetry (''kanshi'') and the waka art form largely fell out of official favor.<ref>Keene, Donald ''Seeds in the Heart'', University of Columbia Press, New York, 1999</ref> But in the 9th century, Japan stopped sending official envoys to [[Tang dynasty|Tang dynasty China]]. This severing of ties, combined with Japan's geographic isolation, essentially forced the court to cultivate native talent and look inward, synthesizing Chinese poetic styles and techniques with local traditions. The waka form again began flourishing and [[Emperor Daigo]] ordered the creation of an anthology of waka.<ref>[http://reservata.s61.xrea.com/akitu/8-heian6.htm Daigo Tenn<U+014D> to Kokin Wakash<U+016B>], retrieved 18 September, 2012</ref> where the waka of ancient poets and their contemporaries were collected and the anthology named "[[Kokin Wakash<U+016B>]]", meaning ''Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese Poems''. It was presented to the emperor in 905. This was the first waka anthology edited and issued under imperial auspices<ref>{{nihongo|Theories|<U+52C5><U+64B0><U+8AAC>|chokusen-setsu}} based on the Chinese preface of the ''Kokinsh<U+016B>'' that the ''Man'y<U+014D>sh<U+016B>'' was conceived as a court anthology notwithstanding.

;Rise of Japanese national culture

;The first three ''chokusensh<U+016B>''
The {{nihongo|first three imperially-commissioned ''waka'' anthologies|<U+4E09><U+4EE3><U+96C6>|Sandai-sh<U+016B>}} were the ''Kokin Wakash<U+016B>'', the ''[[Gosen Wakash<U+016B>]]'' and the ''[[Sh<U+016B>i Wakash<U+016B>]]''. The ''Kokinsh<U+016B>'' was compiled by [[Ki no Tsurayuki]], [[Ki no Tomonori]], [[<U+014C>shik<U+014D>chi no Mitsune]] and [[Mibu no Tadamine]] on the orders of [[Emperor Daigo]] in 905. It collected roughly 1,100 ''waka'' that had not appeared in the ''Man'y<U+014D>sh<U+016B>'' into 20 volumes, arranged by theme. The ''Kokinsh<U+016B>'' poems are generally considered to be reflective and idealistic.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

Roughly half a century after the compilation of the ''Kokinsh<U+016B>'', in 951, [[Emperor Murakami]] commanded the [[Five Men of the Pear Chamber]] to compile the ''Gosen Wakash<U+016B>'', in addition to preparing ''kundoku'' readings for the ''Man'y<U+014D>sh<U+016B>'', which by that time was already difficult for even educated Japanese to read. The selection of poems for the ''Gosensh<U+016B>'' centered around {{nihongo|"gift poems"|<U+8D08><U+7B54><U+6B4C>|z<U+014D>t<U+014D>ka}} exchanged between members of Heian nobility{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}, and the poetry showed a trend toward a more narrative style.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

In 1005 [[Emperor Ichij<U+014D>]] commanded the compilation of the ''Sh<U+016B>ish<U+016B>''.

;The five later-Heian anthologies
The above three court anthologies, in addition to the five following anthologies, are known as the {{nihongo|"Collections of Eight Ages"|<U+516B><U+4EE3><U+96C6>|Hachidai-sh<U+016B>}}, and were all compiled during the [[Heian period]].

===Medieval===
===Kamakura to Muromachi Periods===
After the Heian period, during the [[Kamakura period]] and later, [[renga]], a form of collaborative linked poetry, began to develop. In the late Heian period, three of the last great waka poets appeared: [[Fujiwara no Shunzei]], his son [[Fujiwara no Teika]], and [[Emperor Go-Toba]]. Emperor Go-Toba ordered the creation of a new anthology and joined in editing it. The anthology was named ''[[Shin Kokin Wakash<U+016B>]]''. He edited it again and again until he died in 1239. Teika made copies of ancient books and wrote on the theory of waka. His descendants, and indeed almost all subsequent poets, such as [[Sh<U+014D>tetsu]], taught his methods and studied his poems. The courtly poetry scenes were historically dominated by a few noble clans and allies, each of which staked out a position.

By this period, a number of clans had fallen by the wayside, leaving the [[Reizei family|Reizei]] and the [[Nijo family]]; the former stood for "progressive" approaches, the varied use of the "ten styles" and novelty, while the latter conservatively hewed to already established norms and the "ushin" (deep feelings) style that dominated courtly poetry.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} Eventually, the Nijo family became defunct, leading to the ascendancy of the "liberal" Reizei family.  Their innovative reign was soon deposed by the Asukai family, aided by the Ashikaga shogun, Ashikaga Yoshinori.

In the [[Muromachi period]], renga became popular in the court and people around it. It spread to the priestly classes and thence to wealthy commoners. In much the same way as waka, renga anthologies were produced under the imperial aegis.  As momentum and popular interest shifted to the renga form, the tanka style was left to the Imperial court. Conservative tendencies exacerbated the loss of life and flexibility. A tradition named Kokin-denju,{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} the heritage of Kokin Wakash<U+016B>, was developed. It was a system on how to analyze the Kokin Wakash<U+016B> and included the secret (or precisely lost) meaning of words. Studying waka degenerated into learning the many intricate rules, allusions,  theories, and secrets, so as to produce tanka that would be accepted by the court.

There were comical waka already in the [[Kojiki]] and the [[Man'y<U+014D>sh<U+016B>]], but the noble style of waka in the court inhibited and scorned such aspects of waka.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} Renga was soon in the same position with many codes and strictures reflecting literary tradition. [[Renku|Haikai no renga]] (also called just [[haikai]] (playful renga)) and ky<U+014D>ka, comical waka, were a reaction to this seriousness. But in the Edo-period waka itself lost almost all of its flexibility and began to echo and repeat old poems and themes.

===Early modern===
===Tokugawa shogunate period===
In the early Edo period, waka was not a fashionable genre. Newly created ''[[renku|haikai no renga]]'' (of whose [[hokku]], or  opening verse, [[haiku]] was a late 19th-century revision) was the favored genre. This tendency was kept during this period, but in the late Edo period waka faced new trends from beyond the court. [[Motoori Norinaga]], the great reviver of the traditional Japanese literature, attempted to revive waka as a way of providing "traditional feeling expressed in genuine Japanese way". He wrote waka, and waka became an important form to his followers, the [[Kokugaku]] scholars.

In [[Echigo province]] a Buddhist priest, [[Ry<U+014D>kan]], composed many waka in a na<U+00EF>ve style intentionally avoiding complex rules and the traditional way of waka. He belonged to another great tradition of waka: waka for expressing religious feeling. His frank expression of his feeling found many admirers, then and now. In the cities, a comical, ironic and satiric form of waka emerged. It was called [[ky<U+014D>ka]] (<U+72C2><U+6B4C>), mad poem, and was loved by intellectual people in big cities like [[Edo]] and [[Osaka]]. It was not precisely a new form; satirical waka was a style known since ancient times. But it was in the Edo period that this aspect of waka developed and reached an artistic peak. Still, most waka poets kept to ancient tradition or made those reformation another stereotype, and waka was not a vibrant genre in general at the end of this period.
