'''The Flying Circus''' were a short-lived Toronto-based group fronted by singer/songwriter, [[Bruce Cockburn]]. The band, which was active between late 1967 and early 1968, also featured [[Neil Merryweather]] and future [[Mapleoak]] members, [[Marty Fisher]] and Gordon MacBain.

==The Mynah Birds==
After leaving [[The Mynah Birds]] (sometimes spelt Myna Byrds) in early September 1967, Neil Lillie (later better known as Neil Merryweather) was introduced to ex-[[The Esquires (Canadian band)|Esquires]] member Bruce Cockburn through [[The Five Man Electrical Band]]. The pair decided to launch a new group and recruited former [[Bobby Kris & The Imperials]] members Martin Fisher and Gordon MacBain who were playing at the Concorde Tavern in Toronto at the time.  

Signed to [[Harvey Glatt|Harvey Glatt<U+2019>s]] management, The Flying Circus recorded a number of unreleased tracks in Toronto during late 1967, including Cockburn<U+2019>s <U+201C>Flying Circus<U+201D>, <U+201C>She Wants To Know<U+201D>, <U+201C>I<U+2019>m Leaving You Out<U+201D> and <U+201C>Mother<U+201D> as well as Lillie<U+2019>s <U+201C>Last Hoorah<U+201D> and <U+201C>Elephant Song<U+201D> and Fisher and MacBain<U+2019>s <U+201C>Where Is All The Love<U+201D>. During the same sessions, the band also recorded songs by Cockburn<U+2019>s former [[The Children (band)|The Children]] cohort, [[William Hawkins (songwriter and poet)|William Hawkins]], such as <U+201C>Merry Go Round<U+201D>, <U+201C>It<U+2019>s A Dirty Shame<U+201D> and <U+201C>Little Bit Stoned<U+201D>.<ref>Later versions of which may be found on the tribute album, ''[[Dancing Alone: Songs of William Hawkins]]'' ([[True North Records|True North]], 2008), involving the participation of Cockburn.</ref> 

Around this time, the group also recorded a few tracks with another former Children member Sandy Crawley, which were never released. 

On October 1, the band began a residence at [[Le Hibou]] in Ottawa. The following month, from November 14<U+2013>18, 1967, The Flying Circus played at the Riverboat in Toronto. Over the next few months, the group also opened for [[Wilson Pickett]] and [[Roy Orbison]] at the Capitol Theatre in Ottawa. 

==Flying Circus becomes Olivus==
In early March 1968, Lillie left to form Heather Merryweather and was replaced by former [[Livingstone<U+2019>s Journey]] member Dennis Pendrith. The group<U+2019>s road manager, Michael Ferry (Lee Jackson of [[Jon and Lee & The Checkmates]]) suggested that the group should change name to [[Olivus]].
