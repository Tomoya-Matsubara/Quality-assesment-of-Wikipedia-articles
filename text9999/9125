The Kakapo, like many other New Zealand bird species, was historically important to the [[M<U+0101>ori people|M<U+0101>ori]], the indigenous people of New Zealand, appearing in many of their traditional legends and folklore. It was hunted and used as a resource by M<U+0101>ori, both for its meat as a food source and for its feathers, which were used to make highly valued pieces of clothing. It was also sometimes kept as a pet.

==Taxonomy, systematics and naming==
The Kakapo was originally described by English ornithologist [[George Robert Gray]] in 1845. Its generic name is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] ''strix'', genitive ''strigos'' "owl", and ''ops'' "face", while its specific epithet comes from ''habros'' "soft", and ''ptilon'' "feather".<ref name=Liddell1980>{{Cite book| author = [[Henry George Liddell|Liddell, Henry George]] and [[Robert Scott (philologist)|Robert Scott]] | year = 1980 | title = [[A Greek-English Lexicon]] (Abridged Edition) | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | location = United Kingdom | isbn =0-19-910207-4}}</ref> It has so many unusual features that it was initially placed in its own [[tribe (biology)|tribe]], '''Strigopini'''. Recent [[phylogenetic]] studies have confirmed the unique position of this genus as well as the closeness to the [[K<U+0101>k<U+0101>]] and the [[Kea]], both belonging to the New Zealand parrot genus ''Nestor''.<ref name="Wright"/><ref name=Grant-Mackie/><ref name=deKloet/> Together, they are now considered a separate family within the parrots, [[Strigopidae]].<ref name=Christidis>{{Cite book|title=Systematics and Taxonomy of Australian Birds|author=Christidis L, Boles WE |year=2008 |publisher=CSIRO Publishing |location=Canberra |isbn=978-0-643-06511-6 |page=200}}</ref> Within the Strigopidae, the Kakapo is placed in its own [[tribe (biology)|tribe]], Strigopini. Earlier ornithologists felt that the Kakapo may be related to the [[Pezoporus|ground parrots and Night Parrot]] of Australia due to their similar coloration, but this is contradicted by recent studies;<ref>[[Richard Schodde|Schodde, R.]] & [[Ian J. Mason|Mason, I.J.]] (1981). Nocturnal Birds of Australia. Illustrated by Jeremy Boot.

''[[Auk (journal)|Auk]]'' '''111''': 833-843</ref> rather, the [[crypsis|cryptic]] color seems to be [[adaptation]] to terrestrial habits that evolved twice [[convergent evolution|convergently]].

The name "Kakapo" is the English transliteration of "k<U+0101>k<U+0101>p<U+014D>" which is derived from the [[M<U+0101>ori language|M<U+0101>ori]] terms ''k<U+0101>k<U+0101>'' ("parrot") + ''p<U+014D>'' ("night"). The [[Polynesian languages|Polynesian]] term ''k<U+0101>k<U+0101>'' and its [[Polynesian languages#Internal correspondences|variant]] ''<U+02BB><U+0101><U+02BB><U+0101>'' were the generic South Pacific terms for [[Psittacidae]]. For example, the native names of the [[K<U+0101>k<U+0101>]], the [[extinct]] [[Black-fronted Parakeet]] (''Cyanoramphus zealandicus'') of [[Tahiti]], and the New Zealand members of the [[genus]] ''[[Cyanoramphus]]'' are also derived from them.

The Kakapo is a large, rotund parrot; the male measures up to {{convert|60|cm|in|abbr=on|lk=on}} and weighs from {{convert|2|to|4|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} at maturity.<ref name="Higgins1999">{{Cite book|author=Higgins, P.J.| year=1999| title=[[Handbook of Australian, New Zealand and Antarctic Birds]]. Volume 4: Parrots to Dollarbird| publisher=Oxford University Press| location=Melbourne| isbn=0-19-553071-3}}</ref> The Kakapo cannot fly, having short [[wing]]s for its size and lacking the pronounced keel bone ([[sternum]]) that anchors the flight muscles of other birds. It uses its wings for balance, support, and to break its fall when leaping from trees. Unlike other land birds, the Kakapo can accumulate large amounts of body [[fat]] to store energy, making it the heaviest parrot.<ref name="Powlesland2006"/>

The upper parts of the Kakapo have yellowish moss-green [[feather]]s barred or mottled with black or dark brownish grey, blending well with native [[vegetation]].
Individuals may have strongly varying degrees of mottling and colour tone and intensity <U+2014> museum specimens show that some birds had completely yellow colouring. The breast and flank are yellowish-green streaked with yellow. The belly, undertail, neck and face are predominantly yellowish, streaked with pale green and weakly mottled with brownish-grey. Because the feathers do not need the strength and stiffness required for flight, they are exceptionally soft, giving rise to the [[specific name (zoology)|specific epithet]] ''habroptilus''. The Kakapo has a conspicuous facial disc of fine feathers, resembling the face of an [[owl]]; thus, early European settlers called it the "owl parrot". The beak is surrounded by delicate [[whiskers|vibrissae]] or "whiskers", which the bird uses to sense the ground for navigation as it walks with its head lowered. The mandible is mostly ivory-coloured, with part of the upper mandible being bluish-grey. The eyes are dark brown. Kakapo feet are large, scaly, and, as in all parrots, [[dactyly|zygodactyl]] (two toes face forward and two backward). The pronounced claws are particularly useful for climbing. The ends of the tail feathers often become worn from being continually dragged on the ground.<ref name="Powlesland2006"/>

[[File:Strigops habroptilus, face.jpg|thumb|The "whiskers" around the beak.]]
The female is easily distinguished from the male: she has a more narrow and less domed head, her beak is narrower and proportionally longer, her cere and nostrils smaller, her legs and feet more slender and pinkish grey, and her tail proportionally longer. While her plumage colour is not very different to that of male, the toning is more subtle, with less yellow and mottling. She tends to resist more and be more aggressive than the male when handled. A nesting female also has a [[brood patch]] on the bare skin of the belly.<ref name="Powlesland2006"/>

Like many parrots, the Kakapo has a variety of calls. As well as the ''booms'' (see [[Kakapo#Media|below]] for a recording) and ''chings'' of their mating calls, it will often ''skraark'' to announce its location to other birds.

The Kakapo has a well-developed sense of smell, which complements its nocturnal lifestyle.<ref name="Hagelin04">{{Cite journal

===Anatomy===
The skeleton of the Kakapo differs from other parrots in several features associated with flightlessness. Firstly, it has the smallest relative wing size of any parrot. Its wing feathers are shorter, more rounded, less asymmetrical, and have fewer distal barbules to lock the feathers together. The sternum is small, and has a low, [[vestigial]], keel, and a shortened [[spina externa]]. As in other flightless birds and some other flighted parrots, the [[furcula]] is not fused, but consists of a pair of [[clavicles]] lying in contact with each [[coracoid]]. As in other flightless birds, the angle between the coracoid and sternum is enlarged. The Kakapo has a larger pelvis than other parrots. The proximal bones of the leg and arm are disproportionately long and the distal elements are disproportionately short.<ref name="Livezey1992">{{Cite journal

The [[pectoralis major muscle|pectoral]] musculature of the Kakapo is also modified by flightlessness. The  [[pectoralis major muscle|pectoralis]] and [[supracoracoideus]] muscles are greatly reduced. The [[propatagialis tendo longus]] has no distinct muscle belly. The [[sternocoracoideus]] is tendinous. There is an extensive [[cucularis capitis clavicularis]] muscle that is associated with the large crop.<ref name="Livezey1992"/>

It seems that the Kakapo <U+2014> like many of New Zealand's bird species <U+2014> has [[evolution|evolved]] to occupy an [[ecological niche]] normally filled by various species of mammal (the only non-marine mammals native to New Zealand are three species of small [[bat]]s). Before the arrival of humans, the Kakapo was distributed throughout the three main islands of New Zealand. It lived in a variety of habitats, including [[tussock grass|tussocklands]], scrublands and coastal areas. It also inhabited forests, including those dominated by [[Podocarpaceae|podocarps]] ([[Dacrydium cupressinum|rimu]], [[Prumnopitys taxifolia|matai]], [[Dacrycarpus dacrydioides|kahikatea]], [[Podocarpus totara|totara]]), [[Nothofagus|beeches]], [[tawa (tree)|tawa]], and [[Metrosideros umbellata|rata]].  In [[Fiordland]], areas of avalanche and slip debris with regenerating and heavily fruiting vegetation <U+2014> such as five finger, [[Aristotelia serrata|wineberry]], [[bush lawyer (plant)|bush lawyer]], [[tutu (plant)|tutu]], [[hebe (plant)|hebes]], and [[coprosma]]s <U+2014> became known as "Kakapo gardens".<ref>{{cite journal|author = P.

The Kakapo is primarily nocturnal; it roosts under cover in trees or on the ground during the day and moves around its territories at night.<ref name="Best1984"/>

Though the Kakapo cannot fly, it is an excellent climber, ascending to the crowns of the tallest trees. It can also "parachute" - descending by leaping and spreading its wings. In this way it may travel a few metres (yards) at an angle of less than 45 degrees.<ref name="Powlesland2006"/>

Having lost the ability to fly, it has developed strong legs. Movement is often by way of a rapid "jog-like" gait by which it can move many kilometres (miles).<ref name="Higgins1999"/> A female has been observed making two return trips each night during nesting from her nest to a food source up to {{convert|1|km|mi|1|abbr=on}} away<ref>{{cite journal|author=R.G.

Conservation staff and volunteers have engaged extensively with some Kakapo, which have distinct personalities.<!--might be able to get this simplified; someone familiar with the topic will have to do so.-->

The Kakapo was a very successful species in pre-human New Zealand<ref name="GOG"/> and one of the reasons for this was their set of adaptations to effectively avoid predation from native birds of prey, which were their only predators in the past. However, these same behaviours have been of no use to them when faced with the mammalian predators which were introduced to New Zealand after human settlement, because these hunt in different ways. As hunters, birds behave very differently to mammals, relying on their  powerful vision to find prey and thus, they usually, (with the exception of [[owl]]s) hunt by day.<ref name="GOG"/> Apart from the two surviving New Zealand [[Bird of prey|raptors]], the [[New Zealand Falcon]] and [[Swamp Harrier]], there were two other birds of prey in pre-human New Zealand: [[Haast's Eagle]] and [[Eyles' Harrier]].<ref name="GOG"/> All four species soared overhead searching for prey in daylight and to avoid these avian predators, the Kakapo's ancestors adopted camouflaged plumage and became nocturnal.  In addition, when the Kakapo feels threatened, it freezes, so that it is more effectively camouflaged in the forest vegetation which their plumage resembles. It was not entirely safe at night when the [[Laughing Owl]] was active and it is apparent from their nest deposits on Canterbury limestone cliffs that the Kakapo was among their prey.<ref name="LWOTM">{{Cite book |last1=Worthy |first1=T.H. |last2=Holdaway |first2=R.N. |title=The Lost world of the Moa: Prehistoric life in New Zealand |publisher=Canterbury University Press |location=Christchurch |year=2002 |page=718}}</ref>

Mammalian predators, in contrast to birds, rely on their sense of smell and hearing to find prey and often hunt by night.<ref name="GOG"/> The Kakapo's adaptations to avoid avian predation have thus been useless against its new enemies - this is one of the reasons for its massive decline since the introduction of dogs, cats and [[Mustelidae|mustelids]] - see ''Conservation: Human impact''. A typical way for humans to hunt down the Kakapo is by releasing trained dogs.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The habits of flightless birds of New Zealand: with notes on other flightless New Zealand birds| author=R. Henry| year=1903| publisher=Government Printer| location=Wellington}}</ref>

===Diet===
The beak of the Kakapo is adapted for grinding food finely. For this reason, the Kakapo has a very small [[gizzard]] compared to other birds of their size. It is generally [[Herbivore|herbivorous]], eating native [[plant]]s, [[seed]]s, [[fruit]]s, [[pollen]]s and even the sapwood of trees. A study in 1984 identified 25 plant species as Kakapo food.<ref name="Best1984"/> It is particularly fond of the fruit of the [[Dacrydium cupressinum|rimu]] tree, and will feed on it exclusively during seasons when it is abundant. The Kakapo has a distinctive habit of grabbing a leaf or frond with a foot and stripping the nutritious parts of the plant out with its beak, leaving a ball of indigestible fiber. These little clumps of plant fibres are a distinctive sign of the presence of the bird.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Gray, R.S. |year=1977| title=The kakapo (''Strigops habroptilus'', Gray 1847), its food, feeding and habitat in Fiordland and Maud Island| version=M.Sc. thesis| publisher=Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Atkinson, I.

The plants eaten most frequently during the year include some species of ''Lycopodium ramulosum'', ''Lycopodium fastigium'', ''Schizaea fistulosa'', ''Blechnum minus'', ''Blechnum procerum'', ''Cyathodes juniperina'', ''Dracophyllum longifolium'', ''Olearia colensoi'' and ''Thelymitra venosa''. Individual plants of the same species are often treated differently. The Kakapo leaves conspicuous evidence of their feeding activities, from 10<U+00D7>10&nbsp;m (30<U+00D7>30&nbsp;ft) to 50<U+00D7>100&nbsp;m (160<U+00D7>300&nbsp;ft) feeding ground areas.<ref name="Best1984"/> [[Leptospermum scoparium|Manuka]] and yellow silver pine scrubs are obvious signs of its centre of feeding activities.

During the courting season, males leave their home ranges for hilltops and [[ridge]]s where they establish their own mating courts. These leks can be up to {{convert|7|km|mi|0}} from a Kakapo's usual territory and are an average of 50&nbsp;metres (160&nbsp;ft) apart within the lek arena. Males remain in the region of their court throughout the courting season. At the start of the breeding season, males will fight to try to secure the best courts. They confront each other with raised feathers, spread wings, open beaks, raised claws and loud screeching and growling. Fighting may leave birds with injuries or even kill them.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1017/S0959270900001933|last=Clout|first=M.N.|coauthors= Merton, D.V.|year=1998|title=Saving the Kakapo: the conservation of the world's most peculiar parrot|journal=Bird Conservation International|volume=8|pages=281<U+2013>295|issue=3}}</ref>

Each court consists of one or more saucer-shaped depressions or "bowls" dug in the ground by the male, up to 10&nbsp;centimetres (4&nbsp;in) deep and long enough to fit the half-metre length of the bird. The Kakapo is one of only a handful of birds in the world which actually constructs its leks.<ref name="CFGNZW"/> Bowls are often created next to rock faces, banks, or tree trunks to help reflect sound -<ref name="Merton1984"/> the bowls themselves function as amplifiers to enhance the projection of the males booming mating calls.<ref name="CFGNZW"/> Each male<U+2019>s bowls are connected by a network of [[trail]]s or tracks which may extend 50 metres (160&nbsp;ft) along a ridge or 20 metres (60&nbsp;ft) in diameter around a hilltop.<ref name="Merton1984"/> Males meticulously clear their bowls and tracks of debris. One way researchers check whether bowls are visited at night is to place a few twigs in the bowl; if the male visits overnight, he will pick them up in his beak and toss them away.

To attract females, males make loud, low-frequency (below 100&nbsp;[[Hertz|Hz]]) booming calls from their bowls by inflating a [[thorax|thoracic]] sac.<ref name="Higgins1999"/><ref name="Cockrem2002">{{cite journal|author=J.F.

The booms can be heard at least one kilometre (0.6&nbsp;mi) away on a still night; wind can carry the sound at least five kilometres (3&nbsp;mi).<ref name="Merton1984"/> Males boom for an average of eight hours a night; each male may produce thousands of booms in this time. This may continue every night for three or four months during which time the male may lose half his body weight. Each male moves around the bowls in his court so that the booms are sent out in different directions. These booms are also notorious for attracting predators, because of the long range at which they can be heard.

Females are attracted by the booms of the competing males; they too may need to walk several kilometres from their territories to the arena. Once a female enters the court of one of the males, the male performs a display in which he rocks from side to side and makes clicking noises with his beak.<ref name="Powlesland2006"/> He turns his back to the female, spreads his wings in display and walks backwards towards her. The duration of attempted copulation is between 2 to 14&nbsp;minutes.<ref name="Powlesland2006"/> Once the birds have mated, the female returns to her home territory to lay eggs and raise the chicks. The male continues booming in the hope of attracting another female.

The female Kakapo lays up to three [[ovum|eggs]] per breeding cycle.<ref name="Cockrem2002"/> She nests on the ground under the cover of plants or in cavities such as hollow tree trunks. The female incubates the eggs faithfully, but is forced to leave them every night in search of food. Predators are known to eat the eggs and the embryos inside can also die of cold in the mother's absence. Kakapo eggs usually hatch within 30&nbsp;days,<ref name="Easton2006">{{cite journal|title=Breeding biology of kakapo (''Strigops habroptilus'') on offshore island sanctuaries, 1990<U+2013>2002| author= Daryl K.

After the eggs hatch, the female feeds the chicks for three months, and the chicks continue to remain with the female for some months after [[fledge|fledging]].<ref name="Cockrem2002"/> The young chicks are just as vulnerable to predators as the eggs, and young have been killed by many of the same predators that attack adults. Chicks leave the nest at approximately 10 to 12&nbsp;weeks of age. As they gain greater independence, their mothers may feed the chicks sporadically for up to 6&nbsp;months.

Because the Kakapo is long-lived, with an average life expectancy of 95&nbsp;years and the maximum at about 120&nbsp;years, it tends to have an adolescence before it starts breeding.<ref name="Yearbook">{{Cite book| title =Rare Birds Yearbook 2008| publisher =MagDig Media Lmtd| year =2007| location =England| page =151| isbn =978-0-9552607-3-5| author =editor, Erik Hirschfeld }}</ref> Males do not start to boom until about 5&nbsp;years of age.<ref name="Higgins1999"/> It was thought that females reach [[sexual maturity]] at 9 years of age;  but this idea was debunked in the 2008 breeding season when two 6-year-old females named Apirama and Rakiura laid eggs.<ref name="FB328">Forest and Bird Magazine, Number 328, May 2008 (page 5)</ref> Generally females do not seek out males until they are between 9 and 11-years-old.<ref name="Easton2006"/> The Kakapo does not breed every year and has one of the lowest rates of reproduction among birds. Breeding occurs only in years when trees mast (fruit heavily), providing a plentiful food supply. [[Dacrydium cupressinum|Rimu]] mast occurs only every three to five years, so in rimu-dominant forests such as those on Codfish Island, Kakapo breeding occurs as infrequently.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Nutrient composition of the diet of parent-raised kakapo nestlings| author=Yvette Cottam, Don V. Merton, and Wouter Hendriks| pages=90<U+2013>99| journal=Notornis| volume=53| issue=1| year=2006| url=http://notornis.osnz.org.nz/system/files/Notornis_53_1_90.pdf}}</ref>

Another interesting aspect of the Kakapo's breeding system is that a female can alter the sex ratio of her offspring depending on her condition. A female that eats protein-rich foods produces more male offspring (males have 3%<U+2013>40% more body weight than females). Females produce offspring biased toward the dispersive sex when competition for resources (such as food) is high and toward the non-dispersive sex when food is plentiful. A female Kakapo will likely be able to produce eggs even when there are few resources, while a male Kakapo will be more capable of perpetuating the species when there are plenty, by mating with several females.<ref name="berkeley_kakapo_reproduction">{{cite web

==Conservation==
Fossil records indicate that in pre-Polynesian times, the Kakapo was New Zealand's third most common bird<ref name="GOG">{{Cite book |title=Ghosts of Gondwana; The history of life in New Zealand |author=George Gibbs |publisher=Craig Potton Publishing |year=2007}}</ref> and it was widespread on all three main islands. However, the population of Kakapo in New Zealand has declined massively since human settlement of the country. Since 1891, conservation efforts have been made to prevent extinction. The most successful scheme has been the Kakapo Recovery Plan; this was implemented in 1989 and is still ongoing.

===Human impact===
<!--[[File:Kakapo size comparison.png|thumb|Size comparison against an average human.{{Specify|date=March 2008}}]]-->
The first factor in the decline of the Kakapo was the arrival of humans. [[M<U+0101>ori mythology|M<U+0101>ori]] folklore suggests that the Kakapo was found throughout the country when the [[Polynesians]] first arrived in [[Aotearoa]] 700 years ago <ref name="Tipa2006">{{cite journal|title=Kakapo in M<U+0101>ori lore|author=Rob Tipa| journal=Notornis| volume=53| issue=1| year=2006}}</ref> [[subfossil]] and [[midden]] deposits show that the bird was present throughout the North Island, South Island and [[Stewart Island/Rakiura|Stewart Island]] before and during early M<U+0101>ori times.<ref name="FGNZB">Barrie Heather and Hugh Robertson, illustrated by Derek Onley, ''The Field guide to the birds of New Zealand'', Viking, revised edition, 2005</ref> M<U+0101>ori settlers from [[Polynesia]] hunted the Kakapo for food and for their skins and feathers, which were made into luxurious [[cape]]s.<ref name="Tipa2006"/> They used the dried heads as ear ornaments. Due to its flightlessness, strong scent and habit of freezing when threatened, the Kakapo was easy prey for the M<U+0101>ori and their dogs. Its eggs and chicks were also predated by the [[Polynesian Rat]] or kiore, which the M<U+0101>ori brought to New Zealand.<ref name="Merton77"/> Furthermore, the deliberate clearing of vegetation by M<U+0101>ori reduced the habitable range for Kakapo. Although the Kakapo was extinct in many parts of the islands by the time Europeans arrived,<ref name="Williams1956">{{cite journal|journal=Notornis| author=G. R.

Beginning in the 1840s, European settlers cleared vast tracts of land for [[farming]] and [[grazing]], further reducing Kakapo habitat. They brought more dogs and other mammalian predators, including domestic cats, black rats and [[stoats]].<ref name="Sutherland2002">{{cite journal|journal=Nature| title=Conservation Biology: Science, Sex and the Kakapo| volume=419|issue=6904| author=W.

As the M<U+0101>ori had done, early European explorers and their dogs ate Kakapo. In the late 19th century, the Kakapo became well known as a scientific curiosity, and thousands were captured or killed for zoos, museums and collectors. Most captured specimens died within months. From at least the 1870s, collectors knew the Kakapo population was declining; their prime concern was to collect as many as possible before the bird became extinct.

In the 1880s, large numbers of [[Mustelidae|mustelids]] ([[stoat]]s, [[ferret]]s and [[weasel]]s) were released in New Zealand to reduce [[rabbit]] numbers,<ref>{{cite journal|author=Murphy, E and Dowding, J.| year=1995 |title=Ecology of the stoat in ''Nothofagus'' forest: home range, habitat use and diet at different stages of the beech mast cycle| journal=New Zealand Journal of Ecology| volume=19 |issue=2| pages=97<U+2013>109| url=http://www.nzes.org.nz/nzje/free_issues/NZJEcol19_2_97.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref> but they also preyed heavily on many native species including the Kakapo. Other browsing animals, such as introduced [[deer]], competed with the Kakapo for food, and caused the extinction of some of its preferred plant species. The Kakapo was reportedly still present near the head of the [[Whanganui River]] as late as 1894, with one of the last records of a Kakapo in the North Island being a single bird caught in the [[Kaimanawa Range]]s by Te Kepa Puawheawhe in 1895.<ref name="FLM"/>

===Early protection efforts===
In 1891, the New Zealand government set aside [[Resolution Island, New Zealand|Resolution Island]] in Fiordland as a nature reserve. In 1894, the government appointed [[Richard Treacy Henry|Richard Henry]] as caretaker. A keen naturalist, Henry was aware that native birds were declining, and began catching and moving Kakapo and [[kiwi]] from the mainland to the predator-free Resolution Island. In six years, he moved more than 200 Kakapo to Resolution Island. By 1900, however, [[stoats]] had swum to Resolution Island and colonised it; they wiped out the nascent Kakapo population within 6 years.<ref name="Hill1987">Hill, S.; Hill, J. 1987. Richard Henry of Resolution Island. Dunedin, John McIndoe.</ref>
[[File:Kakapo5.jpg|thumb|left|Thousands of Kakapo were collected for museums across the world]]
In 1903, three Kakapo were moved from Resolution Island to the nature reserve of [[Little Barrier Island]] north-east of [[Auckland]], but [[feral cats]] were present and the Kakapo were never seen again. In 1912, three Kakapo were moved to another reserve, [[Kapiti Island]], north-west of [[Wellington]]. One of them survived until at least 1936, despite the presence of feral cats for part of the intervening period.<ref name="Hill1987"/>

By the 1920s, the Kakapo was extinct in the [[North Island]] and its range and numbers in the [[South Island]] were declining.<ref name="Williams1956"/> One of its last refuges was rugged Fiordland. There, during the 1930s, it was often seen or heard, and occasionally eaten, by hunters or roadworkers. By the 1940s, reports of Kakapo were becoming scarce.

In the 1950s, the [[New Zealand Wildlife Service]] was established and began making regular expeditions to search for the Kakapo, mostly in Fiordland and what is now the [[Kahurangi National Park]] in the northwest of the South Island. Seven Fiordland expeditions between 1951 and 1956 found only a few recent signs. Finally, in 1958 a Kakapo was caught and released in the [[Milford Sound]] catchment area in Fiordland. Six more Kakapo were captured in 1961; one was released and the other five were transferred to the [[aviary|aviaries]] of the Mount Bruce Bird Reserve near [[Masterton]] in the North Island. Within months, four of the birds had died and the fifth died after about four years. In the next 12 years, regular expeditions found few signs of the Kakapo, indicating that numbers were continuing to decline. Only one bird was captured in 1967; it died the following year.

By the early 1970s, it was uncertain whether the Kakapo was still an extant species. At the end of 1974, scientists located several more male Kakapo and made the first scientific observations of Kakapo booming. These observations led [[Don Merton]] to speculate for the first time that the Kakapo had a [[Lek (mating arena)|lek]] breeding system.<ref name="Merton77"/> From 1974 to 1976, 14 Kakapo were discovered but all appeared to be males. One male bird was captured in the Milford area in 1975, christened "Richard Henry", and transferred to [[Maud Island]]. This raised the possibility that the species would become [[extinct]], because there might be no surviving females. All the birds the Wildlife Service discovered from 1951 to 1976 were in U-shaped [[glaciated valley]]s flanked by almost-vertical cliffs and surrounded by high mountains. Such extreme terrain had slowed colonisation by browsing mammals, leaving islands of virtually unmodified native vegetation. However, even here, [[stoats]] were present and by 1976 the Kakapo was gone from the valley floors and only a few males survived high on the most inaccessible parts of the cliffs.<ref name="Powlesland2006"/>

Before 1977, no expedition had been to [[Stewart Island/Rakiura]] to search for the bird. In 1977, sightings of Kakapo were reported on Stewart Island.<ref name="Powlesland2006"/> An expedition to the island found a track and bowl system on its first day; soon after, it located several dozen Kakapo. The finding in an 8,000 ha area of fire-modified [[scrubland]] and forest raised hope that the population would include females. The total population was estimated at 100 to 200 birds.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/03014223.1995.9518039|author=Powlesland, R.G.; Roberts, A.; Lloyd, B.

[[Mustelid]]s have never colonised Steward Island/Rakiura, but [[feral cat]]s were present. During a survey, it was apparent that cats killed Kakapo with a predation rate of 56% per annum.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Karl |first1=B.J |last2=Best |first2=H.A. |title=Feral cats on Stewart Island: their foods and their effects on kakapo| journal=New Zealand Journal of Zoology| volume=9| pages=287<U+2013>294| year=1982}}</ref> At this rate, the birds could not survive on the island and therefore an intensive cat control was introduced in 1982, after which no cat-killed Kakapo were found.<ref name="Powlesland2006"/> However, to ensure the survival of the remaining birds, scientists decided later that this population should be transferred to predator-free islands; this operation was carried out between 1982 and 1997.<ref name="Lloyd1994">{{cite journal|author=B.

In 1989, a Kakapo Recovery Plan was developed and a Kakapo Recovery Group established to implement it.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Powlesland, R.G.| year=1989 | title=Kakapo recovery plan 1989<U+2013>1994| publisher=Department of Conservation| location=Wellington}}</ref> The New Zealand [[Department of Conservation (New Zealand)|Department of Conservation]] replaced the Wildlife Service for this task. The first action of the plan was to relocate all the remaining Kakapo to suitable islands for them to breed. None of the New Zealand islands were ideal to establish Kakapo without [[Island restoration|rehabilitation]] by extensive revegetation and the eradication of introduced mammalian predators and competitors. Four islands were finally chosen: [[Maud Island|Maud]], [[Little Barrier Island|Hauturu/Little Barrier]], [[Codfish Island|Codfish]] and [[Mana Island, New Zealand|Mana]].<ref name="Lloyd1994"/> Sixty-five Kakapo (43 males, 22 females) were successfully transferred onto the four islands in five translocations.<ref name="Lloyd1994"/> Some islands had to be rehabilitated several times when feral cats, [[stoats]] and [[weka]] kept appearing. Little Barrier Island was eventually viewed as unsuitable due to the rugged landscape, the thick forest and the continued presence of rats, and its birds were evacuated in 1998.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kakaporecovery.org.nz/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=134&Itemid=175|title=Hauturu, or Little Barrier Island |publisher=Kakapo Recovery Programme|accessdate=2009-01-05}}</ref> Along with Mana Island, it was replaced with two new Kakapo sanctuaries, [[Chalky Island (New Zealand)|Chalky Island (Te Kakahu)]] and [[Anchor Island]].<ref name="Powlesland2006"/> The entire Kakapo population of Codfish Island was temporarily relocated in 1999 to [[Pearl Island]] in [[Port Pegasus]] while rats were being eliminated from Codfish.<ref name="Whitehead">{{cite journal | first = Joanna K. | last = Whitehead | title = Breeding success of adult female kakapo (Strigops habroptilus) on Codfish Island (Whenua Hou): correlations with foraging home ranges and habitat selection | year = 2007 | url = http://researcharchive.lincoln.ac.nz/dspace/bitstream/10182/640/3/Whitehead_MSc.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2009-04-12}}</ref> All Kakapo on Pearl and Chalky Islands were moved to Anchor Island in 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kakaporecovery.org.nz/index.php?option=com_content&view=category&layout=blog&id=57&Itemid=223|title=Updates: June to September 2005 |publisher=Kakapo Recovery Programme|accessdate=2009-04-12}}</ref>

A key part of the Recovery Plan is the supplementary feeding of females. The Kakapo breeds only once every two to five years, when a certain type of plant species, primarily [[Dacrydium cupressinum|''Dacrydium cupressinum'' (rimu)]], produces protein-rich fruit and seeds. Observations of the relationship between intermittent breeding and the plant's [[mast year]] help biologists choose which suitable supplementary foods to increase Kakapo breeding frequency.<ref name="Elliott2001">{{cite journal| author=Elliott, G.P.; Merton, D.V.; Jansen, P.W.| year=2001| title=Intensive management of a critically endangered species: the kakapo| journal=Biological Conservation| volume=99| pages=121<U+2013>133| issue=1| doi=10.1016/S0006-3207(00)00191-9}}</ref> In 1989, six preferred foods ([[apple]]s, [[sweet potato]]es, [[almond]]s, [[brazil nut]]s, [[sunflower seed]]s and [[walnut]]s) were supplied ''[[ad libitum]]'' each night to 12 feeding stations. Males and females ate the supplied foods, and females nested on Little Barrier Island in the summers of 1989<U+2013>91 for the first time since 1982, although nesting success was low.<ref>{{cite journal|author=R.

Supplementary feeding not only increases Kakapo breeding frequency, but also affects the [[sex ratio]] of Kakapo offspring, as maternal conditions influence this ratio.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Clout, M.N.; Elliott, G.P.; Robertson, B.C. | year=2002 |title=Effects of supplementary feeding on the offspring sex ratio of kakapo: a dilemma for the conservation of a polygynous parrot | journal=Biological Conservation| volume=107| pages=13<U+2013>18| issue=1| doi=10.1016/S0006-3207(01)00267-1}}</ref> (See [[Kakapo#Reproduction|section "Reproduction"]] for more information on this topic.) This finding was subsequently used to increase the number of female chicks by deliberately manipulating maternal condition.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Robertson, B.C.; Elliott, G.P.; Eason, D.K.; Clout, M.N.; Gemmell, N.J. |year=2006 |title=Sex allocation theory aids species conservation |journal=[[Biology Letters]]| url=http://www.journals.royalsoc.ac.uk/link.asp?id=p5v74428x53j0883|pmid=17148369| pages=229<U+2013>231| volume=2|pmc=1618899| issue=2 |doi=10.1098/rsbl.2005.0430}}</ref> During the winter of 1981, only females below 1.5&nbsp;kg weight were given supplementary feeding to avoid raising their body condition, and the sex ratio results in 1982 were close to parity, eliminating the male-biased sex ratios in the unrestricted feeding.

Though breeding can be improved by supplementary feeding, the survival of young Kakapo is hampered by the presence of Polynesian rats. Of 21 chicks that hatched between 1981 and 1994, nine were either killed by rats or died and were subsequently eaten by rats.<ref name="Elliott2001"/> Nest protection has been intensified since 1995 by using [[rat trap|traps]] and poison stations as soon as a nest had been detected. A small video camera and [[Infrared|infra-red light source]] watch the nest continuously, which will remotely scare approaching rats by small bang and flash lights. To increase the success rate of nesting, a nest watcher places a small thermostatically controlled electric blanket over the eggs or chicks, whenever the female leaves the nest for food. The survival rate of chicks has increased from 29% in unprotected nests to 75% in protected ones<!--years?-->.<ref name="Elliott2001"/>

To monitor the Kakapo population continuously, each bird is equipped with a [[radio transmitter]].<ref name="Elliott2001"/> [[List of Kakapo|Every known Kakapo, barring some young chicks, has been given a name]] by Kakapo Recovery Programme officials. It is an affectionate way for conservation staff to refer to individual birds, and a stark reminder of how few remain. [[Artificial insemination|Artificial incubation]] of eggs and hand-raising of chicks have often been used to improve the condition of the eggs and chicks.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Hand-rearing kakapo (''Strigops habroptilus''), 1997<U+2013>2005| author=Daryl K.

In 2006, the Kakapo Recovery Programme presented a new management plan that would run from 2006 to 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kakapo.org.nz/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=80&Itemid=177|title=A Plan for the Future 2006-2016 |publisher=Kakapo Recovery Programme|accessdate=2009-11-11}}</ref> The key goals of this plan are to increase the female population to at least 60 by 2016, increase genetic diversity, maintain or restore a sufficiently large habitat to accommodate the expected increase in the Kakapo population, and maintain public awareness and support.

The Kakapo Recovery Plan has been a successful programme, with the numbers of Kakapo increasing steadily. Adult survival rate and productivity have both improved significantly since the programme's inception. However, the main goal is to establish at least one viable, self-sustaining, unmanaged population of Kakapo as a functional component of the [[ecosystem]] in a protected habitat.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Cresswell, M.| year=1996 |title=Kakapo recovery plan 1996<U+2013>2005. Threatened Species Recovery Plan No. 21.|  publisher=Department of Conservation| location= Wellington}}</ref> To help meet this conservation challenge, two large Fiordland islands, [[Resolution Island, New Zealand|Resolution]] (20,860&nbsp;ha) and [[Secretary Island|Secretary]] (8,140&nbsp;ha), have been prepared for re-introduction of the Kakapo with large-scale ecological restoration activities.<ref name="Powlesland2006"/>

During the 2008-2009 summer breeding season, the total population of Kakapo rose to over 100 for the first time since monitoring began,<ref>{{cite news |author=NZPA |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/environment/2251118/Kakapo-population-over-100-mark|title=Kakapo population over 100 mark |work=stuff.co.nz |date=11 March 2009}}</ref> reaching {{Number of Living Kakapo}} by February 2012. More than twenty of the 34 chicks had to be hand-reared because of a shortage of food on Codfish Island.<ref name="Kakapo count"/>

In 2012, seven Kakapo were transferred to Little Barrier Island, in an attempt to establish a successful breeding program.<ref name=barrier /> Kakapo were last on the island in 1998.

==In M<U+0101>ori culture==
The Kakapo is associated with a rich tradition of M<U+0101>ori folklore and beliefs. The bird's irregular breeding cycle was understood to be associated with heavy fruiting or "[[Mast year|masting]]" events of particular plant species such as the [[Dacrydium cupressinum|Rimu]] which led M<U+0101>ori to credit the bird with the ability to foretell the future.<ref name="MBL">{{Cite book |author=Murdoch Riley |title=Maori Bird Lore; An introduction |publisher=Viking Sevenseas NZ LTD |year=2001}}</ref> Used to substantiate this claim were reported observations of these birds dropping the berries of the [[Elaeocarpus dentatus|Hinau]] and [[Tawa (tree)|Tawa]] trees (when they were in season) into secluded pools of water to preserve them as a food supply for the summer ahead; in legend this became the origin of the M<U+0101>ori practice of immersing food in water for the same purpose.<ref name="MBL"/>

===Use for food and clothing===
The meat of Kakapo made good eating and was considered by M<U+0101>ori to be a [[delicacy]]<ref name="OS"/> and it was hunted for food when it was still widespread.<ref name="WS">{{Cite book |authors=Rod Morris, Hal Smith |title=Wild South: Saving New Zealands endangered birds |publisher=Random House |location=New Zealand |year=1995}}</ref> One source states that its flesh "resembles [[Lamb and mutton|lamb]] in taste and texture",<ref name="MBL"/> although European settlers have described the bird as having a "strong and slightly stringent flavour".<ref name="OS"/>

In breeding years, the loud booming calls of the males at their [[Lek (mating arena)|mating arenas]] made it easy for M<U+0101>ori hunting parties to track the Kakapo down, and it was also hunted while feeding or when dustbathing in dry weather. The bird was caught, generally at night, using [[Trapping (Animal)#Snares|snares]], pitfall traps, or by groups of domesticated [[Kur<U+012B>|Polynesian dogs]] which accompanied hunting parties <U+2014> sometimes they would use fire sticks of various sorts to dazzle a bird in the darkness, stopping it in their tracks and making the capture easier.<ref name="MBL"/> Cooking was done in a [[h<U+0101>ngi]] or in gourds of boiling oil.<ref name="WS"/> The flesh of the bird could be preserved in its own fat and stored in containers for later consumption <U+2014> hunters of the [[Ng<U+0101>i Tahu]] tribe would pack the flesh in baskets made from the inner bark of [[Totara]] tree or in containers constructed from [[kelp]].<ref name="KM">{{cite web|url=http://www.kakaporecovery.org.nz/then/iwi.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070416165111/http://www.kakaporecovery.org.nz/then/iwi.html |archivedate=2007-04-16 |title=Kakapo then and now; An Iwi Perspective |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2007-04-16 |accessdate=2012-01-15}}</ref> Bundles of Kakapo tail feathers were attached to the sides of these containers to provide decoration and a way to identify their contents.<ref name="OS">{{cite journal |url=http://notornis.osnz.org.nz/system/files/Notornis_53_1_191.pdf  |format=PDF |first=Rob |last=Tipa |title=Short note: Kakapo in M<U+0101>ori Lore |journal=Notornis |volume=53 |pages=193<U+2013>194 |year=2006 |issue=1}}</ref><ref name="KM"/> Also taken by the M<U+0101>ori were the bird's eggs, which are described as whitish "but not pure white", and about the same size as a [[kerer<U+016B>]] egg.<ref name="MBL"/>

As well as eating the meat of the Kakapo, M<U+0101>ori would use Kakapo skins with the feathers still attached or individually weave in Kakapo feathers with flax fibre to create cloaks and capes.<ref name="WS"/><ref name="KM"/><ref>{{cite web| title = Kakapo feather cloak | work = Search the collection database | publisher = British Museum | url = http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/search_object_details.aspx?objectid=497615&partid=1&IdNum=Oc1936,0607.1&orig=/research/search_the_collection_database/museum_no__provenance_search.aspx | accessdate = 1 August 2010}}</ref>  Each one required up to 11,000 feathers to make.<ref name="WNZB?"/> Not only were these garments very beautiful, they also kept the wearer very warm.<ref name="WS"/><ref name="WNZB?">{{Cite book |author=Andrew Crowe |title=Which New Zealand Bird? |publisher=Penguin |year=2001}}</ref> They were highly valued, and the few still in existence today are considered ''[[taonga]]'' (treasures) <U+2014> indeed, the old M<U+0101>ori adage "You have a K<U+0101>k<U+0101>p<U+014D> cape and you still complain of the cold" was used to describe someone who is never satisfied.<ref name="WS"/> Kakapo feathers were also used to decorate the heads of [[taiaha]], but were removed before use in combat.<ref name="OS"/><ref name="KM"/><ref name="WNZB?"/>

Despite this, the Kakapo was also regarded as an affectionate [[pet]] by the M<U+0101>ori. This was corroborated by European settlers in New Zealand in the 19th century, among them [[George Edward Grey]], who once wrote in a letter to an associate that his pet Kakapo's behavior towards him and his friends was "more like that of a dog than a bird".<ref name="MBL"/>
