In February 2011, Huntsman made a controversial appearance at the site of a planned pro-democracy protest in Beijing. In the wake of the [[2010<U+2013>2011 Middle East and North Africa protests]], Chinese democracy activists called for similar protests to be held in major Chinese cities, hoping to engender a large-scale movement they called the [[2011 Chinese pro-democracy protests|"Jasmine Revolution"]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/02/24/ap/asia/main20036264.shtml | publisher=[[CBS News]] | title=China's web police block US ambassador's name|date=February 25, 2011|archivedate=June 29, 2011|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110629041348/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/02/24/ap/asia/main20036264.shtml}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title=China charges subversion for protest repostings|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/feedarticle/9515260|date=February 23, 2011|first=Anita|last=Chang|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=January 22, 2012}}</ref> On February 20, Huntsman was captured on video at the [[Wangfujing]] shopping area, where an anonymous online appeal had called for a major demonstration on that date.

When further asked if he wanted to see "chaos" in China, Huntsman replied "No," and left the area.

====Background====
Huntsman's name appeared on lists of potential Republican nominees for the 2012 presidential election as early as 2008 and 2009,<ref>[http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2009/06/29/cheney-says-gop-presidential-bench-still-strong/ Cheney says GOP presidential bench still strong], [[CNN]] June 29, 2009</ref><ref>[http://voices.washingtonpost.com/thefix/2008/12/the_rising_jon_huntsman_jr.html?nav=rss_blog "The Rising: Jon Huntsman Jr."], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', December 9, 2008</ref> and [[John McCain]] specifically mentioned Huntsman as a potential candidate for the 2012 election in March 2009.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.wtop.com/?nid=213&sid=1635991|title=McCain: Let's see who runs in 2012|agency=Associated Press|publisher=[[WTOP-FM|WTOP]]|date=March 29, 2009}}{{dead link|date=May 2012}}</ref> Huntsman was an early supporter of John McCain's and bundled more than $500,000 for McCain's presidential campaign in 2008.<ref>{{cite news |title=Obama's New Ambassador Nominees Gave Big <U+2013> and Bundled Bigger |author=Beckel, Michael |url=http://www.opensecrets.org/news/2009/06/obamas-new-ambassador-nominees.html |newspaper=OpenSecrets.org |date=June 18, 2009 |accessdate=August 18, 2011}}</ref>

Of McCain's loss, Huntsman observed "We're fundamentally staring down a demographic shift that we've never seen before in America."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/08322/928624-473.stm#ixzz1g6ZjB2m1 |title=Republicans ask: Just how bad is it? |publisher=Post-gazette.com |date=November 17, 2008|accessdate=January 13, 2012 |first=Jonathan |last=Martin}}</ref> On November 12, 2008 [[Politico (newspaper)|Politico]] called him a possible 2012 contender.<ref>{{cite web|last=Martin |first=Jonathan |url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/jonathanmartin/1108/Add_to_the_2012_prospect_list_Jon_Huntsman.html |title=Add to the 2012 prospect list: Jon Huntsman |publisher=Politico.Com |date=November 12, 2008|accessdate=January 13, 2012}}</ref> Washington Post blogger [[Chris Cillizza]] also speculated Huntsman as a possible candidate.<ref name="deseretnews.com"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/705382873/Huntsmans-presidential-profile-still-rising.html |title=Huntsman's presidential profile still rising |publisher=Deseret News |date=December 9, 2008|accessdate=January 13, 2012}}</ref>

Many Republicans were touting Huntsman as a possible rising star in the party and that he has a role in reshaping the party. Utah businessman Republican activist [[Tim Bridgewater]] said "Huntsman has a very bright future." Huntsman said that "I think there will be a lot of personalities emerging between now and 2012. I think the party needs to be smart enough to maintain an open mind. Obama was nowhere on the radar screen four years ago."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/705261585/Huntsman-has-role-in-reshaping-the-GOP.html?pg=1 |title=Huntsman has role in reshaping the GOP |publisher=Deseret News |date=November 8, 2008|accessdate=January 13, 2012}}</ref> In June 2009, Huntsman top advisor [[John Weaver (political consultant)|John Weaver]], who was also an advisor for McCain, claimed "I firmly believe that Huntsman and people like him are the prescription for what ails us.

In August 2010, a group of political strategists close to Huntsman formed a [[political action committee]] now called Horizon PAC that could provide a framework for launching Huntsman's campaign. This PAC was formed in part to draft Huntsman into running for president.<ref>{{cite news|author=Lisa Riley Roche|title=White House says Huntsman leaving ambassadorship|work=Deseret News|date=January 31, 2011|accessdate=January 31, 2011|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700105741/White-House-says-Huntsman-leaving-ambassadorship.html}}</ref> On February 22, 2011, Horizon PAC launched its official website, which made no direct reference to Huntsman but stated that the PAC's mission is "to help elect a new generation of conservative candidates for local and state offices all across America."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.horizon-pac.com/ |title=HPAC <U+2013> Maybe someday we'll find a new generation of conservative leaders |publisher=Horizon PAC|accessdate=May 25, 2011}}</ref> The PAC's website also states that it "supports free-market values, principled leadership and a commitment to long-term solutions".<ref>{{cite news|title=Pro-Huntsman effort launches website, offering 2012 clues|author=Peter Hamby|publisher=CNN|date=February 22, 2011|url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2011/02/22/pro-huntsman-effort-launches-website-offering-2012-clues/|accessdate=February 22, 2011}}</ref>

A January 1, 2011, a ''Newsweek'' article entitled "The Manchurian Candidate" featured an interview with Huntsman, in which he stated, "You know, I'm really focused on what we're doing in our current position.&nbsp;... But we won't do this forever, and I think we may have one final run left in our bones." Asked specifically whether he intended to run for president in 2012, he declined to comment.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Manchurian Candidate|author=McKay Coppins|work=Newsweek|date=January 1, 2011|accessdate=January 31, 2011|url=http://www.newsweek.com/2011/01/04/the-manchurian-candidate.html#}}</ref> The article generated significant speculation about a likely Huntsman 2012 presidential bid.<ref>{{cite news|title=Huntsman paves way for presidential bid|author=Jamshid Ghazi Askar|accessdate=January 31, 2011|work=Deseret News|date=January 28, 2011}}</ref>

====Campaign====

On January 31, 2011, Huntsman submitted his formal resignation from his post as U.S. Ambassador to China effective April 30, 2011, indicating his plans to return to the United States at that time. Both top Democrats and close associates of Huntsman indicated that he was likely to explore a 2012 Republican presidential bid.<ref name=Resigns>{{cite web|author=Mike Allen|date=January 31, 2011|work=[[Politico (newspaper)|Politico]]|accessdate=January 31, 2011|title=Jon Huntsman resigns, may run|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0111/48533.html}}</ref><ref name=Gibbs>{{cite news|author=MJ Lee|coauthor=Alexander Burns|title=Gibbs confirms: Envoy is leaving|work=Politico|date=January 31, 2011|accessdate=January 31, 2011|url=http://www.politico.com/politico44/perm/0111/replacing_huntsman_39985424-7857-4738-ad80-69b614809fee.html}}</ref><ref name=Braces>{{cite news|author=Jonathan Martin|coauthor=Alexander Burns|title=Barack Obama braces for Jon Huntsman 2012 bid|work=Politico|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0111/48454.html|date=January 31, 2011|accessdate=January 31, 2011}}</ref>

===Post-Campaign Politics===
A month after dropping out of the race, Huntsman offered the opinion that there was a need for a [[Third party (politics)|third party]] in America. In an appearance on the MSNBC talk show ''[[Morning Joe]]'' on February 23, 2012,  Huntsman said that a third party would be a healthy development in the  presidential election process. Huntsman said:

<blockquote>I think we<U+2019>re going to have problems politically until we get some sort of third party movement or some voice out there that can put forth new ideas. Someone<U+2019>s going to step up at some point and say we<U+2019>ve had enough of this. The real issues are not being addressed and it<U+2019>s time that we put forward an alternative vision, a bold thinking. We might not win, but we can certainly influence the debate.</blockquote>

Huntsman said he was not throwing his own hat in the ring as a third party presidential candidate in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bingham|first=Amy|title=Jon Huntsman Calls for the Rise of a Third Party|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/02/jon-huntsman-calls-for-the-rise-of-a-third-party/|publisher=ABC News|date=February 23, 2012|accessdate=August 12, 2012}}</ref> 

The [[Republican National Committee]] reacted by withdrawing an invitation for Huntsman to appear at a Republican fundraiser in Palm Beach, Florida, in early March. Huntsman was scheduled as a speaker at the event.<ref>{{cite web|last=Negrin|first=Matt|title=RNC to Huntsman: No Invite for You|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/03/rnc-to-huntsman-no-invite-for-you/|publisher=ABC News|date=March 2, 2012|accessdate=August 12, 2012}}</ref> 

In early July 2012, Huntsman announced that he would not be attending the [[2012 Republican National Convention]] for the first time since he attended as a [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan delegate]] in 1984. Huntsman issued a statement chiding the Republican Party for what he perceived as its failures to focus on the daunting socio-economic issues facing America.

<blockquote>I will not be attending this year's convention, nor any Republican convention in the future until the party focuses on a bigger, bolder, more confident future for the United States <U+2014> a future based on problem solving, inclusiveness, and a willingness to address the trust deficit, which is every bit as corrosive as our fiscal and economic deficits.</blockquote>

Huntsman, whose presidential campaign slogan had been "Country First",<ref>{{cite web|last=Firestone|first=David|title=Huntsman's 'Country First' Slogan|url=http://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/10/huntsmans-country-first-slogan/|work=The New York Times|date=January 10, 2012|accessdate=August 13, 2012}}</ref> also said in his statement:

<blockquote>I encourage a return to the party we have been in the past, from Lincoln right on through to Reagan, that was always willing to put our country before politics.<ref>{{cite web|last=Barr|first=Thomas|title=Huntsman scolds GOP for losing focus, will skip convention|url=http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/politics/54442102-90/huntsman-convention-party-national.html.csp|work=The Salt Lake Tribune|date=July 6, 2012|accessdate=August 12, 2012}}</ref></blockquote>

==Political views==
Huntsman has been described by the ''[[Huffington Post]]'' as "a conservative [[Technocracy|technocrat]]-optimist with moderate positions who was willing to work substantively with President [[Barack Obama]]"<ref>Linkins, Jason (February 11, 2011) [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/02/11/jon-huntsman-2012-staff_n_822055.html Jon Huntsman Staff Choice Suggests The Direction His Campaign Will Take], ''[[Huffington Post]]''</ref> and identifies himself as a center-right conservative.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20095503-503544.html | publisher=CBS News | title=Jon Huntsman: Does a "center right" presidential candidate have a prayer?}}</ref>

As governor, Huntsman listed economic development, health-care reform, education, and energy security as his top priorities. He oversaw tax cuts and advocated reorganizing the way that services were distributed so that the government would not become overwhelmed by the state's fast growing population. He also proposed a plan to reform health-care, mainly through the private sector, by using tax breaks and negotiation to keep prices down.<ref>[[Kathleen Parker|Parker, Kathleen]] (July 26, 2009).

''[[The Washington Post]]''.</ref> In 2007, when asked about a [[healthcare mandate]], Huntsman said, "I'm comfortable with a requirement <U+2013> you can call it whatever you want, but at some point we're going to have to get serious about how we deal with this issue".<ref>Smith, Ben (May 31, 2011).

According to [[Haley Barbour]], former [[Governor of Mississippi]]:
{{Quote|Jon Huntsman and I served together, and while we don't agree on some issues, there's no question that he's a conservative. He's way to the right of Barack Obama for goodness sake. But yeah, I consider Jon a conservative. As I said, we have some issues that I think are important that we have different views on. But he was in the Reagan administration, elected governor of a very conservative state<U+2014>elected and re-elected by the way. So if you're asking me if Jon Huntsman is qualified to the Republican nominee for President of the United States, the answer is, of course he is.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hotair.com/archives/2011/05/20/barbour-of-course-jon-huntsman-is-more-conservative-than-obama/ |title=Barbour: Of course Jon Huntsman is more conservative than Obama |publisher=Hotair.com |date=May 20, 2011|accessdate=October 4, 2011}}</ref>}}

[[File:Jon M. Huntsman Jr. - Annual Meeting of the New Champions Dalian 2009.jpg|thumb|245px|right|Huntsman speaking at the [[World Economic Forum]] in [[Dalian, China]], in 2009]]
In a 2008 evaluation of state governors' fiscal policies, the libertarian [[Cato Institute]] praised Huntsman's conservative tax policies, ranking him in a tie for fifth place on overall fiscal policy. He was particularly lauded for his efforts to cut taxes. The report specifically highlighted his reductions of the sales tax and simplification of the tax code.<ref name=Cato>{{cite web|author=Chris Edward|title=Fiscal Policy Report Card on America's Governors: 2008|publisher=Cato Institute, Policy Analysis No. 624|date=October 20, 2008|url=http://www.cato.org/pubs/pas/pa-624.pdf}}</ref> However, the report concluded that: "Unfortunately, Huntsman has completely dropped the ball on spending, with per capita spending increasing at about 10 percent annually during his tenure."<ref name=Cato/> He defines his taxation policy as "business friendly".<ref>[http://www.ontheissues.org/Jon_Huntsman.htm Jon Huntsman], OnTheIssues</ref>

As part of his presidential campaign, Huntsman claimed that "our tax code has devolved into a maze of special-interest carve-outs, loopholes and temporary provisions that cost taxpayers more than $400 billion a year to comply with."  The candidate called for "[getting] rid of all tax expenditures, all loopholes, all deductions, all subsidies. Use that to lower rates across the board. And do it on a revenue-neutral basis."<ref>Parker, Ashley (August 31, 2011). [http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/01/us/politics/01huntsman.html "Huntsman Urges Stripping Deductions From Tax Code"]. ''[[The New York Times]]''.</ref>

In addition, Huntsman has proposed reducing the corporate tax rate from 35% to 25%, eliminating corporate taxes on income earned overseas, and implementing a tax holiday for repatriation of corporate profits.  He favors eliminating taxes on capital gains and dividends.<ref>[http://jon2012.com/issues/jobs-economy-tax-reform Huntsman 2012 website]. Retrieved December 5, 2011.</ref>

===Environment and energy===
In 2007, in response to the issue of [[global warming]], Huntsman signed the [[Western Climate Initiative]], by which Utah joined with other governments in agreeing to pursue targets for reduced production of [[greenhouse gas]]es.<ref name="struglinski"/> He also appeared in an advertisement sponsored by [[Environmental Defense]], in which he said, "Now it's time for Congress to act by capping greenhouse-gas pollution."<ref name="struglinski">{{Citation| last = Struglinski| first = Suzanne | title = Huntsman appears in climate ad| newspaper=[[Deseret News]] | date = November 16, 2007| url = http://www.deseretnews.com/article/695228198/Huntsman-appears-in-climate-ad.html| accessdate =June 6, 2011}}</ref> In 2011, however, Huntsman said, "[[Emissions trading|Cap-and-trade]] ideas aren't working; it hasn't worked, and our economy's in a different place than five years ago.

"There's not enough information right now to formulate policies in terms of addressing it over all, primarily because it's a global issue," Huntsman said. "We can enact policies here, but I wouldn't want to unilaterally disarm as a country. I wouldn't want to hinder job creators at a time when our economy is flat."<ref>{{Cite news|title=Huntsman shifts stance on climate change|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/gop-presidential-primary/197545-call-him-crazy-but-huntsman-changes-stance-on-climate-change|date=December 6, 2011|first=Daniel|last=Strauss|work=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]|accessdate=December 6, 2011}}</ref>

===Foreign policy===
Huntsman has repeatedly stated, "We need to continue working closely with China to convince [[North Korea]] to abandon its nuclear weapons program." He has also named Taiwan, human rights, and Tibet among the "areas where we have differences with China" and vowed "robust engagement" on human rights if confirmed. The governor, who lived in [[Taiwan]] as a [[Mormon]] missionary, said he felt "personally invested in the peaceful resolution of cross-strait differences, in a way that respects the wishes of the people on both Taiwan and the mainland. He said that current US policy "supports this objective, and I have been encouraged by the recent relaxing of cross-strait tensions."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2009/07/25/2003449509|title=Hoklo-speaking diplomat aims for realistic PRC ties|work= [[The Taipei Times]] |date=July 29, 2009}}</ref> Huntsman is a strong supporter of Israel and has made several visits to Israel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOZag4Pg4Xs |title=Utah Gov.

Other organizations he has served include the [[Utah Opera]], [http://www.envisionutah.org/ Envision Utah], the Coalition for Utah's Future, and [[KSL-TV]]'s Family Now campaign.

In January 2012, [[Huntsman Cancer Institute]] announced that Huntsman had been appointed to the position of Chairman, replacing his father who founded the institute.<ref>{{cite press release|title=Jon M Huntsman Jr named Chairman of the Huntsman Cancer Foundation|url=http://www.huntsmancancer.org/newsroom/press-releases/jon-m-huntsman-jr-named-chairman-of-the-huntsman-cancer-foundation|publisher=Huntsman Cancer Institute|date=January 26, 2012|accessdate=April 5, 2012}}</ref>

Huntsman was appointed to the board of directors of the [[Ford Motor Co.]] in February 2012.

On March 23, 2012, the ''[[Washington Post]]'' reported that Huntsman had met with Democratic [[Senate Majority Leader]] [[Harry Reid]] on the issue of the vacant presidency of the [[World Bank]]. According to the ''Post'', a "family friend" said that Huntsman "fought hard to be named by Obama as head of the World Bank". Huntsman's daughter, Abby Huntsman Livingston, who was present at her father's meeting with Reid, said that he had no interest in the job.<ref>{{cite web|last=Cillizza|first=Chris|title=Jon Huntsman discussed World Bank post with Harry Reid|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/post/jon-huntsman-discussed-world-bank-post-with-reid/2012/03/23/gIQAJ9cOWS_blog.html|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=March 24, 2012|date=March 23, 2012}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Huntsman has eight brothers and sisters, and he and his wife, [[Mary Kaye Huntsman|Mary Kaye]], have seven children: Mary Anne (b. 1985), Abigail (b. 1986), Elizabeth (b. 1988), Jon III (b. 1990), William (b. 1993), Gracie Mei (b. 1999; [[adoption|adopted]] from [[People's Republic of China|China]]), and Asha Bharati (b. 2006; adopted from [[India]]). 

Huntsman is a distant relative (third cousin, once removed) of Republican presidential nominee [[Mitt Romney]]; Romney's great-great-grandfather, the early Mormon missionary [[Parley Pratt]], is Huntsman's great-great-great-grandfather.<ref>[http://newsfeed.time.com/2011/12/20/family-ties-ancestry-com-finds-that-romney-and-george-w-are-cousins/ It<U+2019>s A Family Thing: Ancestry.com Finds that Romney and George W.

After a [[2002 Winter Olympic bid scandal|scandal]] erupted over the [[2002 Winter Olympics]] in Salt Lake City, Romney and Huntsman were both considered to take over the [[Salt Lake Organizing Committee for the Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games of 2002|Salt Lake Organizing Committee]] for the games. After intense lobbying, Romney was chosen, and the Huntsman family was "livid", and in 2011 Huntsman said he was "being used" and Romney's selection was "precooked".<ref name="nymag">[http://nymag.com/news/politics/jon-huntsman-mitt-romney-2011-8/index2.html Running for Grown-up]</ref> As Romney prepared his [[Mitt Romney presidential campaign, 2008|2008 presidential run]], he began consulting Huntsman on foreign policy and trade issues. Huntsman's father signed on as a finance chair for Romney's campaign, and it was expected that Huntsman would endorse Romney; instead, Huntsman backed [[John McCain presidential campaign, 2008|John McCain]] and became one of the McCain campaign's national co-chairs. According to ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' Magazine, sources within Romney's 2008 campaign said Huntsman had promised to endorse Romney; Huntsman denied this. Huntsman's father also came to regret his support for Romney. ''New York'' wrote that after this, "The generations-long ties between the Huntsman and Romney tribes were informally, but conclusively, severed."<ref name="nymag"/> Huntsman was sharply critical of Romney in the 2012 presidential primary race.<ref name="nymag"/>

He is a self-proclaimed fan of the [[progressive rock]] genre and played keyboards during high school in the band ''Wizard''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/may/09/news/la-pn-huntsman-rocks-20110509 |title=Jon Huntsman was a keyboard wizard, but is a presidential run a rock 'n' roll fantasy?|work=Los Angeles Times|date=May 9, 2011 |accessdate=May 25, 2011 |first=James |last=Oliphant}}</ref> On July 30, 2007, he attended a concert by [[progressive metal]] band [[Dream Theater]].

===Religious views===
Huntsman was brought up as a member of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS), and stated in a May 2011 interview with [[George Stephanopoulos]] of [[ABC News]], "I believe in God. I'm a good [[Christian]]. I'm very proud of my Mormon heritage. I am Mormon."<ref>{{Cite news|author=[[George Stephanopoulos]]|title=Transcript: Exclusive Interview With Jon Huntsman|date=May 20, 2011|publisher=[[ABC News]] |url=http://blogs.abcnews.com/george/2011/05/exclusive-interview-with-jon-huntsman.html}}</ref>

However, he told ''[[Newsweek]]'' in December 2010 that the LDS Church doesn't have a monopoly on his spiritual life.<ref name = "NewsMorm">Kirn, Walter (June 5, 2011). [http://www.newsweek.com/2011/06/05/mormons-rock.print.html "Mormons Rock!"]. ''[[Newsweek]]''.</ref> In an interview with ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, he stated that he is more spiritual than religious and that his membership in the LDS Church is "tough to define".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,2071003,00.html|title=Jon Huntsman: The Potential Republican Presidential Candidate Democrats Most Fear|accessdate=May 12, 2011 | work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=May 12, 2011}}</ref><ref name="distancing">{{Cite news | last = Burr| first = Thomas | title = Is Huntsman distancing himself from LDS faith?| newspaper=[[The Salt Lake Tribune]] | date = May 9, 2011| url = http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/huntsman/51779611-188/church-faith-former-governor.html.csp | accessdate =June 15, 2011}}</ref> Although still Mormon, Huntsman has said that he and his wife draw from an array of sources for inspiration, stating:
"Today, there are 13 million Mormons. It's a very diverse and heterogeneous cross-section of people. And you're going to find a lot of different attitudes and a lot of different opinions in that 13 million. I was raised a Mormon, Mary Kaye was raised Episcopalian, our kids have gone to Catholic school, I went to a Lutheran school growing up in Los Angeles. So you kind of bind all this together." <ref>{{Cite news|author=[[ Lisa Riley Roche]]|title=Transcript:

Huntsman rejects the notion that faith and evolution are mutually exclusive. In 2011, in response to a statement by Rick Perry that [[global warming]] was unproven and that evolution remains only a theory, Huntsman [[Twitter|tweeted]], "To be clear. I believe in evolution and trust scientists on global warming. Call me crazy."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/18/huntsman-on-evolution-call-me-crazy/|title=Huntsman on Evolution?

We lose a whole lot of people who would otherwise allow us to win the election in 2012."<ref>{{cite web|title=Huntsman: GOP can't become 'anti-science' party|url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/politicolive/0811/Huntsman_GOP_cant_become_antiscience_party.html|first=Scott|last=Wong|publisher=[[Politico]]|date=August 21, 2011|accessdate=September 12, 2012}}</ref>
