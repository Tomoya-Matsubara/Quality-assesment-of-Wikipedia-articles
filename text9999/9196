}}
'''Joseph Emley Borden''' (May 9, 1854 <U+2013> October 14, 1929) was an [[United States|American]] [[starting pitcher]] in professional baseball for two seasons.  Born in [[Jacobstown, New Jersey]], his recored professional team was the [[Philadelphia White Stockings]] of the [[National Association of Professional Base Ball Players|National Association]]&nbsp;{NA) in {{by|1875}}.  It was during the 1875 season that he pitched the first [[no-hitter]] in a professional game.

When the NA folded after the 1875&nbsp;season, he joined the [[Atlanta Braves|Boston Red Caps]], formerly the Red Stockings who had transferred operations to the newly established [[National League]]&nbsp;{NL) for the {{by|1876}}&nbsp;season.  He is credited with a pitching victory in the NL's first game on April&nbsp;22, and pitched a [[shutout]] on May&nbsp;23, which some claim was the first no-hitter in [[Major League Baseball]].  Known for having an eccentric personality, he played under different surnames, such as Josephs and Nedrob.  Little is known about his post-baseball life, and his death has been reportedly as early as 1889 in the [[Johnstown Flood]], but it is officially recognized as occuring in 1929 at the age of 75.

==Career== 
Born as Joseph Emley Borden in [[North Hanover Township, New Jersey|Jacobstown]], [[New Jersey]], on May&nbsp;9, 1854, into a prominent family, was known to have an eccentric personality.<ref name="retroborden">{{cite web|title=Joe Borden|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/B/Pbordj101.htm|work=retrosheet.org|publisher=Retrosheet, Inc|accessdate=June 23, 2010}}</ref><ref name="cook42">Cook, p. 42</ref>  He pitched his entire two-season professional baseball career under the last name of Josephs, as well using Nedrob, which is Borden spelled backward.<ref name="cook42"/>  

===1875 season===
He first appeared in a professional baseball game on July&nbsp;24, 1875 with [[Philadelphia White Stockings]] of the [[National Association of Professional Base Ball Players|National Association]].<ref name="retroborden"/>  During his time with the White Stockings, he pitched in seven [[games pitched|games]], all of which he [[games started|started]] and [[complete game|completed]].<ref name="retroborden"/>  He pitched two [[shutout]]s in 1875, however, the one on July&nbsp;28 was a [[no-hitter]] against the [[Chicago Cubs|Chicago White Stockings]].<ref name="retroborden"/><ref name="baseballlibrary1875">{{cite web| title = 1875 | work = baseballlibrary.com | publisher=The Idea Logical Company, Inc| url=http://www.baseballlibrary.com/baseballlibrary/chronology/1875Year.stm | accessdate = 06-23-2010 }}</ref>  This is considered the first no-hitter ever thrown in a professional game, since the National Association is not considered a [[Major League Baseball|Major League]].  The [[umpire (baseball)|umpire]] for the game was future [[National League]]&nbsp;(NL) President [[Nicholas Young (executive)|Nicholas Young]].<ref name="baseballlibrary1875"/><ref name="no-hitterchrono">{{cite web|title=No Hitters Chronologically|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/nohit_chrono.htm|work=retrosheet.org|publisher=Retrosheet, Inc|accessdate=June 23, 2010}}</ref>  He finished the season with a 2<U+2013>4&nbsp;[[Win<U+2013>loss record]], and a 1.50&nbsp;[[earned run average]] in 66&nbsp;[[innings pitched]].<ref name="retroborden"/>

===1876 season===
After the 1875 season closed, the league, and subsequently the Philadelphia White Stockings, folded, allowing for the [[National League]]&nbsp;(NL) to be founded as the first Major League.<ref name="baseballlibrary1876">{{cite web| title = 1876 | work = baseballlibrary.com | publisher=The Idea Logical Company, Inc| url=http://www.baseballlibrary.com/baseballlibrary/chronology/1876Year.stm | accessdate = 2006-11-16 }}</ref>  Borden signed a three-year contract worth $2000 a season with the [[Atlanta Braves|Boston Red Caps]] of the NL before the 1876 season.<ref name="macdonald95">Macdonald, p. 95</ref>  The club had hoped that he could adequately fill in for the recently departed [[Albert Spalding]], who had moved on to play for the [[Chicago White Stockings]].<ref name="macdonald95"/>  [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Hall of fame]] baseball writer [[Henry Chadwick (writer)|Henry Chadwick]] described Borden's pitching style as fast, but without strategy.<ref name="macdonald74">Macdonald, p. 74</ref>  In addiction to a swiftly-moving [[fastball]], he also delivered a [[curveball]] that moved down and away from right-handed batters, both of which he threw from a low angle.<ref name="macdonald95"/>  His Red Caps played the [[Philadelphia Athletics (1860<U+2013>1876)|Philadelphia Athletics]] in the first game in NL history on April 22; due to other games being cancelled becuase of rain showers, it was the only game played that day.  The Red Caps defeated the Athletics with two [[run (baseball)|runs]] by the score of 6<U+2013>5 at [[Jefferson Street Grounds|Athletic Park]], with Borden pitching the complete game for the victory.<ref name="baseballlibrary1876"/>

On May 23, Borden seemingly pitched a two-hit shutout, 8<U+2013>0 victory against the [[Cincinnati Reds (1876<U+2013>1880)|Cincinnati Reds]], but some historians claim that this was, in fact, the first no-hitter thrown in the NL, thus becoming the first Major League no-hitter.<ref name="cook50">Cook, p. 50</ref>  According to [[Lee Allen (baseball)|Lee Allen]], baseball historian and writer, the scorecard shows that Borden gave up two [[base on balls|bases on balls]], which were counted as [[hit (baseball)|hits]] in the final score.<ref name="cook50"/>  The offical scorekeeper for the game was [[O. P. Caylor]], a writer for ''[[The Cincinnati Enquirer]]'', who believed, unlike his contemporaries, that bases on balls should be scored as hits.<ref name="cook50"/>  Bases on balls were not official counted as hits until {{by|1887}}, but officially reverted following that season.<ref name="cook50"/>  This hypothesis is not without dispute however; ''The Boston Daily Globe'' reported on the game the following day, and noted that Reds had, in fact had two clean one-base hits during the game.<ref name="cook52">Cook, p. 52</ref> Furthermore, on June 6, the ''[[New York Clipper]]'' did not report an occurance of a no-hitter in their report of the game, though the [[box score]] did have differing stats in other categories than what the ''Daily Globe'' had reported.<ref name="cook52"/>  Consequently, the first official no-hitter in Major League history was pitched by [[George Bradley]], of the [[St. Louis Brown Stockings]] on July 15, 1876.<ref name="no-hitterchrono"/>

Two days after his controversial near no-hitter, on May 25, Borden and the Red Caps faced the Reds again; this time against [[Cherokee Fisher]], resulting in a scoreless game through nine innings.<ref name="cook52"/>  The Red Caps scored four runs in tenth inning for a 4-0 victory.<ref name="cook52"/>  Unfortunely for Borden, his pitching effectivelness declined rapidly after this, at one point he reportedly threw a tantrum during a game, due to his inaccurate pitching, even admonishing his teammate, future Hall of famer [[George Wright (sportsman)|George Wright]], who was known to be a good-natured person.<ref name="macdonald120">Macdonald, p. 120</ref>  Due to his erratic pitching and behavior, he was released from the team by August.<ref name="cook52"/><ref name="macdonald120"/>  

==Post-baseball career==
Though the Red Caps still had released him as a player, they still employed him as a ticket-taker and groundskeeper due to the fact that he was still under contract.<ref name="cook52"/>  He also reportedly found work stitching baseballs in [[Philadelphia]].<ref name="cook52"/>Little is known of Borden's life after baseball, and it has been alledged that he died in May of 1889 during the [[Johnstown Flood]], the same disaster that stranded the entire [[Louisville Colonels]] team.<ref name="cook166">Cook, p. 166</ref>  Official he died in [[Yeadon, Pennsylvania]] at the age of 75, and is interred at [[Oaklands Cemetery]] in [[West Chester, Pennsylvania]].<ref name="retroborden"/>
