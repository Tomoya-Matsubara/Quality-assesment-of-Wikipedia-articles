'''Daphne Mayo''' [[MBE]] (1895-1982) is a significant 20th century Australian artist, most prominently known for her work in sculpture, particularly the tympanum of [[Brisbane City Hall]].

==Early life==
Born in Sydney in 1895, she was educated in Brisbane, and received a Diploma in Art Craftsmanship from the Brisbane Central Technical College in 1913. At the college she was strongly influenced by L.J Harvey who initiated her interest in modelling.<ref name="look">{{cite book |title=Looking up looking back at old Brisbane |last=Readshaw |first=Grahame |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1987 |publisher=Booralong Publications |location=[[Bowen Hills, Queensland]] |isbn=0864390327 |pages=11 }}</ref> She further developed her skills in this medium when she was presented with an opportunity to go to London in 1919.<ref name="ldm"/> There she took a position as an assistant sculptor before her acceptance into the Sculpture School of the [[Royal Academy]].<ref name="womqld"/>

==Prominent Works==
Despite her small frame, she produced many physically demanding works that were carved [[In_situ#Architecture|in situ]].<ref name="look"/> On her return to Brisbane in 1925, Daphne created a number of local works including:
* The [[Brisbane City Hall]] Tympanum (1927-30). The tympanum represents a relief of early settlement entitled The progress of civilisation in the State of Queensland. This sculpture has been considered one of the most important Brisbane sculpture commissions ever awarded.

* The Queensland Women's War Memorial (1929-32) located in Brisbane's [[ANZAC Square, Brisbane|Anzac Square]] is a sandstone relief of a military procession. The first war memorial depicting servicewomen, this piece is also important for highlighting the important contribution made by women to the tradition of war memorials.<ref name="womqld">[http://www.epa.qld.gov.au/publications/p00813aa.pdf Women and the arts - Queensland women contributions to the Heritage Register]</ref>
* A statue of Major General Sir [[William Glasgow]] (1961-64).<ref name="look"/>

==Public Service==
She lobbied successfully on numerous occasions for funding for the fledgling [[Queensland Art Gallery]], established with painter colleague [[Vida Lahey]] an Art Reference Library at the [[University of Queensland]] in 1936, was a trustee of the [[Queensland Art Gallery]] (1960-67), and left her private papers to The [[University of Queensland]]'s Fryer Library.<ref name="lect">[http://www.uq.edu.au/events/event_view.php?event_id=2545 Professor Roger Benjamin `Juan Davila: from Convulsive Decoration to the Salon] Lecture</ref>
