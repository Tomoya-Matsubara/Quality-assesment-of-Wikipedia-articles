{{nihongo|'''S<U+014D>suke Uno'''|<U+5B87><U+91CE> <U+5B97><U+4F51>|Uno S<U+014D>suke|extra=August 27, 1922 &ndash; May 19, 1998}} was a [[Japan]]ese [[politician]] and the 75th [[Prime Minister of Japan]] from June 3, 1989 to August 10, 1989.

He was born in [[Shiga Prefecture]] and attended the [[Kobe University|Kobe University of Commerce]].  After serving in the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] during [[World War II]], he entered politics, winning election to the [[Diet of Japan]] in 1960.

Uno's main action as prime minister was to institute the country's first [[consumption tax]], which immediately caused an uproar among many voters and led to the [[Japan Socialist Party]]'s victory in the Tokyo metropolitan legislative election of 1989.  Uno's government was also hurt by repercussive effects from the [[Recruit Scandal]] of 1988.  Uno assumed office on June 3, 1989.

Uno eventually had to resign after less than three months amid a [[sex scandal]] revealed by a [[geisha]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} The controversy surrounding Uno's extramarital affair was more focused on irresponsibility rather than immorality; Uno supposedly did not support his mistress, at the least not with an appropriate amount, which led her to complain publicly. The story was not widely publicized in Japan until a ''[[Washington Post]]'' reporter picked up the story from the ''[[Mainichi Shimbun]]'', bringing international attention to Uno.

Following Uno's resignation, most LDP lawmakers refused to associate with him,{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} and he quickly lost control over his faction within the party.

He died in [[Moriyama, Shiga]].
