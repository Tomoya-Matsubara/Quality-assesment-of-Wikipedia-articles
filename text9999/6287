"'''Hong Kong Garden'''" was the debut single released by [[England|English]] band [[Siouxsie & the Banshees]].  Issued in the UK by [[Polydor Records]] in 1978, the track was written by Banshees members [[Siouxsie Sioux]], [[Steven Severin]], [[John McKay (musician)|John McKay]] and [[Kenny Morris]] and produced by their manager Nils Stevenson and a young sound-engineer   [[Steve Lillywhite]].

The song was named after the Hong Kong Garden Chinese takeaway in [[Chislehurst]] High Street. Siouxsie is quoted as explaining the lyrics with reference to the racist activities of skinheads visiting the takeaway:
{{cquote|"I<U+2019>ll never forget, there was a Chinese restaurant in Chislehurst called 'The Hong Kong Garden'. Me and my friend were really upset that we used to go there and like, occasionally when the skinheads would turn up it would really turn really ugly. These gits were just go in ''en masse'' and just terrorise these Chinese people who were working there. We<U+2019>d try and say <U+2018>Leave them alone<U+2019>, you know. It was a kind of tribute."

{{cquote|"I remember wishing that I could be like [[Emma Peel]] from ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]'' and kick all the skinheads' heads in, because they used to mercilessly torment these people for being foreigners. It made me feel so helpless, hopeless and ill."  Source: ''Uncut'' [http://www.thebansheesandothercreatures.co.uk/thescreamtrivia.htm link], 01/O5}}.

The lyrics ''"Slanted eyes meet a new sunrise / A race of bodies small in size / Chicken Chow Mein and Chop Suey / Hong Kong garden takeaway"'' and the song itself could be interpreted as an ode to Chinese food restaurateurs whose culture is or was regarded with contempt by some non-Chinese in Britain.

The song was released as a stand-alone single and hit number seven in the [[UK singles chart]].  When the Banshees' debut album ''[[The Scream (album)|The Scream]]'' was released later in the year, "Hong Kong Garden" was not included.  It later surfaced on the singles compilation album ''[[Once Upon a Time: The Singles]]''.  When ''The Scream'' was re-mastered and re-issued in [[2005]] with bonus material, "Hong Kong Garden" was included in the package.

In March 2005, [[Q magazine|''Q'' magazine]] placed the song at number 90 in its list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Tracks. It was also included on the soundtrack for Sofia Coppola's 2006 film ''[[Marie Antoinette (2006 film)|Marie Antoinette]]''. The version on the soundtrack features an orchestral string intro.
