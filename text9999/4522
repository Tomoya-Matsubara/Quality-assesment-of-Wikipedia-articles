[[Air Vice Marshal]] '''Francis Hubert (Frank) McNamara''' [[Victoria Cross|VC]], [[Order of the Bath|CB]], [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (4&nbsp;April 1894 &ndash; 2&nbsp;November 1961) was an [[Australia]]n recipient of the [[Victoria Cross]], the highest decoration for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to a member of the [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] forces. Serving with the Australian Flying Corps, he was honoured for his actions on 20 March 1917, when he rescued a fellow pilot who had been forced down behind enemy lines. McNamara was the first Australian aviator, and the only one in [[World War I]], to receive the Victoria Cross. He later became a senior commander in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF).

Born and educated in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], McNamara was a teacher when he joined the [[Australian Army Reserve|militia]] prior to World War I. In 1915, he was selected for pilot training at [[Central Flying School RAAF|Central Flying School]], [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Point Cook Base|Point Cook]], and transferred to the Australian Flying Corps the following year. He was based in the [[Middle Eastern theatre of World War I|Middle East]] with [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&nbsp;1 Squadron]] when he earned the Victoria Cross. In 1921, McNamara enlisted as a [[Flying Officer]] in the newly formed RAAF, rising to the rank of Air Vice Marshal by 1942. He held senior posts in England and [[Aden]] during [[World War II]]. Retiring from the Air Force in 1946, McNamara continued to live in Britain until his death from heart failure in 1961.

===Militia to Australian Flying Corps===
As a militia officer, McNamara was mobilised for service in Australia when war was declared in August 1914.<ref name="Dennis"/> After serving briefly at bases in [[Queenscliff, Victoria|Queenscliff]] and [[Point Nepean, Victoria]], McNamara passed through Officers Training School at [[Broadmeadows, Victoria|Broadmeadows]] in December.

On 20 March 1917, McNamara, flying a Martinsyde, was one of four No.&nbsp;1 Squadron pilots taking part in a raid against a Turkish railway junction near [[Gaza]]. Owing to a shortage of bombs, the aircraft were each armed with six specially-modified 4.5-inch [[howitzer]] shells.<ref name="Wilson">Wilson, ''The Brotherhood of Airmen'', pp.11&ndash;13</ref> McNamara had successfully dropped three of his shells when the fourth exploded prematurely, badly wounded him in the leg with [[Shrapnel shell|shrapnel]], an effect he likened to being "hit with a sledgehammer".<ref name="Macklin pp.84-93"/><ref name="Wilson"/> Having turned to head back to base, he spotted a fellow squadron member from the same mission, Captain David Rutherford, on the ground beside his crashlanded B.E.2.<ref name="Garrison"/><ref name="Stephens pp.14-15">Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.14&ndash;15</ref> Allied airmen had been hacked to death by enemy troops in similar situations, and McNamara saw that a company of Turkish cavalry was fast approaching Rutherford's position.<ref name="Stephens pp.14-15"/> Despite the rough terrain and the gash in his leg, McNamara landed near Rutherford in an attempt to rescue him.<ref name="AIF Project"/><ref name="Wilson"/> As there was no spare cockpit in the single-seat Martinsyde, the downed pilot jumped on to McNamara's wing and held the struts. McNamara crashed while attempting to take off, however, due to the effects of his leg wound and Rutherford's weight overbalancing the aircraft. The two men, who had escaped further injury in the accident, set fire to the Martinsyde and went back to Rutherford's two-seat B.E.2.

[[George V of the United Kingdom|His Majesty the KING]] has been graciously pleased to approve of the award of the Victoria Cross to the undermentioned Officers, Non-Commissioned Officers and Men: <U+2014>

[...]

Lt. Frank Hubert McNamara, Aus. Forces, R.F.C.

For most conspicuous bravery and devotion to duty during an aerial bomb attack upon a hostile construction train, when one of our pilots was forced to land behind the enemy's lines.

Lt. McNamara, observing this pilot's predicament and the fact that hostile cavalry were approaching, descended to his rescue. He did this under heavy rifle fire and in spite of the fact that he himself had been severely wounded in the thigh.

He landed about 200 yards from the damaged machine, the pilot of which climbed on to Lt. McNamara's machine, and an attempt was made to rise. Owing, however, to his disabled leg, Lt. McNamara was unable to keep his machine straight, and it turned over. The two officers, having extricated themselves, immediately set fire to the machine and made their way across to the damaged machine, which they succeeded in starting.

Finally Lt. McNamara, although weak from loss of blood, flew this machine back to the aerodrome, a distance of seventy miles, and thus completed his comrade's rescue.}}

Promoted to Captain on 10 April 1917, McNamara became a [[Flight (military unit)|flight commander]] in [[No. 4 Squadron RAAF|No.&nbsp;4 Squadron AFC]] (also known until 1918 as No.&nbsp;71 Squadron RFC), but was unable to continue flying due to the leg wound he suffered on 20 March.<ref name="AWM"/><ref name="AWM Timeline"/>  He was invalided back to Australia in August aboard HT ''Boorara'', and given a hero's welcome on arrival in Melbourne.<ref name="AWM"/><ref name="Macklin pp.94-99">Macklin, ''Bravest'', pp.94&ndash;99</ref> Found to be medically unfit for active service, McNamara was discharged from the Australian Flying Corps on 31 January 1918.<ref name="AWM"/><ref name="AWM Timeline"/> However, panic caused by the intrusion into Australian waters of the German raider ''Wolf'' resulted in him being recalled to the AFC and put in charge of an aerial reconnaissance unit based in [[South Gippsland]], Victoria, flying an [[Royal Aircraft Factory F.E.2|F.E.2B]] and later a [[Farman MF.11|Maurice Farman Shorthorn]].<ref name="Macklin pp.94-99"/><ref>Coulthard-Clark, ''A Hero's Dilemma'', pp.54&ndash;55</ref>  In September 1918, he was posted as a flying instructor to Point Cook, where he saw out the remainder of the war.<ref name="AWM"/><ref name="Macklin pp.94-99"/>

That month McNamara was deeply affected by the loss of his close friend Peter Drummond, who had helped keep attacking cavalry at bay during his Victoria Cross action in 1917. Drummond's [[B-24 Liberator]] disappeared near the [[Azores]] ''en route'' to Canada and all aboard were presumed killed; McNamara had to break the news to his widow, Isabel.<ref>Coulthard-Clark, ''A Hero's Dilemma'', pp.104&ndash;105</ref>  McNamara's health had also suffered from exposure to the desert dust in Aden, and he was unable to take up his next position as the RAAF's representative at the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] until September.<ref name="Macklin pp.94-99"/> His entire war was spent outside Australia.<ref name="High Fliers"/>

==Retirement and legacy==
[[Image: UK2834McNamara.jpg|thumb|left|McNamara (centre) flanked by his wife and son in London, 1945]]
McNamara was summarily retired from the RAAF in 1946, along with a number of other senior commanders and veterans of World War I, officially to make way for the advancement of younger and equally capable officers.
