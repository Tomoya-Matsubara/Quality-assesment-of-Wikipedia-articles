'''Gideon Sundback''' (April 24, 1880 <U+2013> June 21, 1954) was a [[Sweden|Swedish]]-[[United States|American]] electrical engineer. Gideon Sundback is most commonly associated with his work in the development of the [[zipper]].<ref>[http://www.invent.org/hall_of_fame/302.html ''Gideon Sundback'' (National Inventors Hall of Fame])</ref>

==Background==
Otto Fredrik Gideon Sundback was born on Sonarp farm in <U+00D6>destugu Parish, in [[J<U+00F6>nk<U+00F6>ping County]], [[Sm<U+00E5>land]], [[Sweden]]. He was the son of Jonas Otto Magnusson Sundb<U+00E4>ck, a prosperous farmer, and  his wife Kristina Karolina Klasdotter. After his studies in [[Sweden]], Sundback moved to [[Germany]], where he studied at the polytechnic school in [[Bingen am Rhein]]. In 1903, Sundback took his engineer exam. In 1905, he emigrated to the [[United States]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Inventing the 20th century: 100 inventions that shaped the world: from the airplane to the zipper|publisher=NYU Press|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=aVHRRoQvW60C&pg=PA58&dq=Gideon+Sundback+and+nationality&hl=en&ei=X3bITrHkDonFtgewkP3RCw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CDwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=Gideon%20Sundback%20and%20nationality&f=false}}</ref><ref>Petroski, Henry ''The Evolution of Useful Things'' (Random House of Canada, 1994) ISBN 0-679-74039-2 page 103 </ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Biographical Dictionary of the History of Technology|publisher=Taylor & Francis|page=1181|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=n--ivouMng8C&pg=PA1181&dq=Gideon+Sundback+Swedish-American&hl=en&sa=X&ei=7zqlT9iZK5Cu8AT6jP27Aw&ved=0CEMQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&q=Gideon%20Sundback%20United%20States&f=false}}</ref>

==Career==
In 1905, Gideon Sundback started to work at [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company]] in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]]. In 1906,  Sundback was hired to work for the Universal Fastener Company of [[Hoboken, New Jersey]]. Subsequently in 1909,<ref>http://www.thestar.com/living/article/1166960--gideon-sundback-inventor-of-the-zipper-honoured-by-today-s-google-doodle</ref> Sundback was promoted to the position of head designer at Universal Fastener.

Sundback made several advances in the development of the [[zipper]] between 1906 and 1914, while working for companies that later evolved into [[Talon Zipper|Talon, Inc.]]  He built upon the previous work of other engineers such as [[Elias Howe]], Max Wolff, and [[Whitcomb Judson]].

He was responsible for improving the "Judson C-curity Fastener".  At that time the company's product was still based on hooks and eyes. Sundback developed an improved version of the C-curity, called the "Plako", but it too had a strong tendency to pull apart, and was not any more successful than the previous versions. Sundback finally solved the pulling-apart problem in 1913, with his invention of the first version not based on the hook-and-eye principle, the "Hookless Fastener No. 1". He increased the number of fastening elements from four per inch to ten or eleven. His invention had two facing rows of teeth that pulled into a single piece by the slider, and increased the opening for the teeth guided by the slider.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thomasnet.com/articles/hardware/zipper-history |title='&#39;History of the Zipper'&#39; (Thomas Publishing Company) |publisher=Thomasnet.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-23}}</ref>

In 1914, Sundback developed a version based on interlocking teeth, the "Hookless No. 2", which was the modern metal zipper in all its essentials. In this fastener each tooth is punched to have a dimple on its bottom and a nib or conical projection on its top. The nib atop one tooth engages in the matching dimple in the bottom of the tooth that follows it on the other side as the two strips of teeth are brought together through the two Y channels of the slider. The teeth are crimped tightly to a strong fabric cord that is the [[selvage]] edge of the cloth tape that attaches the zipper to the garment, with the teeth on one side offset by half a tooth's height from those on the other side's tape. They are held so tightly to the cord and tape that once meshed there is not enough play to let them pull apart. A tooth cannot rise up off the nib below it enough to break free, and its nib on top cannot drop out of the dimple in the tooth above it. {{US patent|1219881}}  for the "Separable Fastener" was issued in 1917.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.design-technology.info/inventors/page16.htm |title='&#39;Gideon Sundback'&#39; (Inventors & Inventions) |publisher=Design-technology.info |date=2008-07-26 |accessdate=2012-04-23}}</ref>

The name ''zipper'' was created in 1923 by [[Benjamin Goodrich|B.F. Goodrich]], who used the device on their new [[boot]]s. Initially, boots and [[tobacco]] pouches were the primary use for zippers; it took another twenty years before they caught on in the [[fashion]] industry. About the time of [[World War II]] the zipper achieved wide acceptance for the flies of trousers and the [[placket]]s of skirts and dresses.<ref name=Friedel96>''Zipper: An exploration in novelty'' (Robert Friedel, author. W. W. Norton and Company, New York, 1996) ISBN 0-393-31365-4</ref>

Sundback also created the manufacturing machine for the new zipper.   Lightning Fastener Company, one early manufacturer of the zipper, was based in [[St. Catharines]], [[Ontario]]. Although Sundback frequently visited the Canadian factory as president of the company, he resided in [[Meadville, Pennsylvania|Meadville]], [[Pennsylvania]] and remained an [[United States citizen|American citizen]]. Sundback was awarded the Gold Medal of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Engineering Sciences]] in 1951. Sundback died of a heart condition in 1954 and was interred at [[Greendale cemetery]] in Meadville, Pennsylvania.

==Personal==
On June 5, 1909, Sundback married Elvira Aronson, daughter of the Swedish born plant manager Peter Aronsson, in Hoboken, New Jersey.<ref>{{cite book|title=Zipper: An Exploration in Novelty|publisher=W.

==Legacy==
In 2006, Gideon Sundback was honored by inclusion in the [[National Inventors Hall of Fame]] for his work on the development of the zipper.<ref name="Friedel96"/><ref>[http://dr.library.brocku.ca/handle/10464/3010 ''Lightning Fastener Company Limited'' (Brock University)]</ref> On April 24, 2012, the 132nd anniversary of Sundback's birth, [[Google]] changed the [[Google logo]] on its homepage to a [[Google Doodle]] of the [[zipper]], which when opened revealed the results of a search for ''Gideon Sundback''.<ref>{{cite news|title=Gideon Sundback celebrated in a Google doodle|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/apr/24/gideon-sundback-celebrated-google-doodle|accessdate=24 April 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=24 April 2012}}</ref>
