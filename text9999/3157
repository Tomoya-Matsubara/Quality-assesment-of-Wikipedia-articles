'''''Zauvjek tvoj''''' ({{lang-en|Forever yours}}) is the fourth studio album of [[Montenegro|Montenegrin]] singer [[Dado Polumenta]], released on December 15, 2008. This album mainly consisted of cover versions of Greek songs, most of which were remixed. Four singles have appeared from this album (in order of release): ''Kafa Espresso'' ({{lang-en|Coffee, Espresso}}), ''Moja srno'', ''Ljep<U+0161>a od no<U+0107>i'' ({{lang-en|Prettier than the night}}) and ''Zauvjek tvoj'' ({{lang-en|Forever yours}}).

The album was released under the [[Vujin Records]] label, and was sponsored by [[DM SAT]]. Coincidentally, [[Dragana Mirkovi<U+0107>]]'s 2008 album, entitled [[Eksplozija]] (Explosion), was released the same day as this album by the same record label and same sponsor.

''Kafe Espresso'' (credited as "Kafa Espresso" on the official music video), the first single produced from this album, was released a little over a year before this album's release. Upon release, the song became a major hit throughout discoth<U+00E8>ques, radio stations, etc. The song, however, is a mere cover of DJ Pantelis' remix of the Greek song, ''Beautiful'' by [[Christos Dantis]]. The music video accompanying this song was released many months after the song's release, in ca. June 2008. The music video itself had been costly, including a Rolls-Royce, which values to about 650,000 euros. Featured in the music video were Serbian actress [[Milica Nasti<U+0107>]], Servian footballers [[Milan Stepanov]] and [[Bojan Krasi<U+0107>]], the daughter of Serbian singer [[Goca Bo<U+017E>inovska]] and basketball trainer [[Muta Nikoli<U+0107>]]. Serbian singers [[Bojan Bjeli<U+0107>]], [[Sa<U+0161>a Kova<U+010D>evi<U+0107>]] and Tika were supposed to make an appearance in the music video, however, were unable to do so for unknown reasons. This music video takes place in a Bowling Alley, while simultaneously switching to a Bar scene every few seconds or so.

"''Moja srno''", the second single that arose from this album, was first unveiled at the [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian]] [[Vogo<U+0161><U+0107>a Festival 2008]], which was held on 28 May 2008.  

"''Ljep<U+0161>a od no<U+0107>i''", a duet featuring <U+0160>ako Polumenta and the third single from this album, has been remixed from its original version, as featured on <U+0160>ako Polumenta's album, [[Sanjao sam san...]]. The newly-remixed version has a more techno feel to it, and is more suited for discoth<U+00E8>ques, unlike its original counterpart. This might have also been done to separate the song from its Greek counterpart. This can be said as the music of the original version was more of a direct copy of the Greek version. However, Dado Polumenta is known to have remixed many of his songs to feature Techno beat, adjusting the music to suit the general public, including his fans.

The fourth single released from this album, "''Zauvjek tvoj''" (''Forever Yours'') (credited as "Zauvijek tvoj" on the official music video), arose shortly after the release of the album itself.

Another song also featured on this album, entitled "''Dama''" (''Dame''), which has been deemed by many as the album's biggest hits, includes a sample of the international hit [[I'll Do It Like A Truck]] by Spanish artist [[Geo de Silva]]. 

As previously announced on Dado Polumenta's website, Dado Polumenta had featured a highly-emotionally ballad dedicated to his mother on this album, entitled "''Majka''" (''Mother''). The ballad, however, is a cover of one of popular British singer, Samy Yusuf's, songs.
 
Dado Polumenta also featured a remake of the song, "''Bila je lijepa''" (She was pretty), by the Bosnian band [[Macbeth (Bosnian band)|Macbeth]]. The lyrics remained the same, overall, however, the music was remixed to give it a more modern style that is suited for those of the younger generations.
