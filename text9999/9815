'''Kali''' (born as '''Hanka Gordzialkowska''' on December 18, 1918, died 1998), was a Polish-American fine art painter known for her in stylized portraiture. She used many variations of her name after marriage and immigration including Hanna Kali Weynerowski, Hanna Weynerowski-Kali, Hanna Gordzialkowski-Weynerowski, Hanka Weynerowska, and Hanna Gordzialkowski; and her artwork was simply signed "Kali". Her figures resemble Old Master work in subject and positioning, but are painted simplified, flattened and more graphic. The paintings are brightly colored, often shown with the subject sitting in bust length, with elongated faces, flattened bodies, a patterned element such as part of the clothing, the hands of the subject in classical positioning. Her work has been compared to a [[Mannerism|Neo-mannerist]] meets [[Surrealism|Surrealist]] style. She was also a combatant during World War II, involved in the [[Polish resistance movement in World War II|Polish Resistance Movement]] when the Nazi's occupied Poland.
