The '''1998 Pymatuning earthquake''' occurred in the U.S. state of [[Pennsylvania]] on September 25, 1998. With a [[Richter scale|magnitude]] of 5.2, it was the greatest recorded [[earthquake]] in Pennsylvania's history.

== Location ==
The earthquake's epicenter was at latitude 41<U+00B0>29<U+2032>24<U+2033> N and longitude 80<U+00B0>22<U+2032>48<U+2033> W, about {{convert|25|km|mi|sp=us}} southwest of [[Meadville, Pennsylvania|Meadville]]; its depth was {{convert|5|km|mi|sigfig=1|sp=us}}.<ref name=USGS>{{Cite web|url=http://neic.usgs.gov/neis/eq_depot/1998/eq_980925/|title=Magnitude 5.2 Pennsylvania|publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]]|date=November 10, 2003|accessdate=March 20, 2009}}</ref>

== Impact ==
The earthquake caused minor damage in towns near its epicenter and was felt in the states of [[Ohio]], Pennsylvania, [[Indiana]], [[Michigan]], [[New York]], [[Illinois]] and [[New Jersey]], as well as [[Southern Ontario|Southern]] [[Ontario]] in [[Canada]].<ref name=USGS/>

=== Hydrologic occurrences ===
After the earthquake many [[water well|well]]s in the epicentral region began to dry up, while new springs and old wells began to flow. A three-month date range revealed 120 dry household-supply wells. Declines of up to {{convert|100|ft|m|...|sp=us}} were observed on a ridge where at least 80 of these wells resided. The degree of the damage varied. Some of the wells lost all power or could barely hold their yields, and some of the water in wells turned black or began to smell of [[sulfur]]. An official explanation of these phenomena has not been arrived at, yet the most likely cause is the vertical [[hydraulic conductivity]] of shale rock under this area. In this scenario water could have leaked from the hilltops on the ridge.<ref name=Hydrologic1>{{cite web|url=http://pa.water.usgs.gov/reports/wrir_99-4170.pdf|author=Fleeger, Gary M., et al.|title=Hydrologic Effects of the Pymatuning Earthquake of September 25, 1998, in Northwestern Pennsylvania|publisher=Pennsylvania Geological Survey|date=1998|accessdate=March 20, 2009}}</ref>
