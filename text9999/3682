[[Image:Mrt_lrt_rail_map.png|thumb|300px|The East-West Line is coloured green on system maps. This map includes the Changi Airport Branch, but excludes the under-construction Boon Lay extension continuing from the western end of the East-West Line]]

The '''East West MRT Line''' was the second [[Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore)|Mass Rapid Transit]] line in [[Singapore]] to be built. The line is currently [[1 E4 m|45.4]] [[kilometre|km]] long with 29 stations, and operated by [[SMRT Corporation]]. 1 complete loop of this line needs around an hour. This line is coloured  '''<font color=green>green</font>''' on MRT system maps.

As the name implies, the line connects central Singapore to both western and eastern parts of the island, with an additional branch to [[Changi Airport MRT Station|Changi Airport]] from [[Tanah Merah MRT Station|Tanah Merah]]. Cross-platform transfer to the [[North South MRT Line|North South Line]] is provided at [[Jurong East MRT Station|Jurong East]], [[City Hall MRT Station|City Hall]] and [[Raffles Place MRT Station|Raffles Place]] stations while transfer to the [[North East MRT Line|North East Line]] at [[Outram Park MRT Station|Outram Park]] station is possible via a linkway.

==Future extensions==

===Boon Lay Extension (BLE)===
After months of planning, the Land Transport Authority announced on [[December 29]], [[2004]], the details of the '''Boon Lay Extension (BLE)'''. The 3.8 kilometre, 2 station line will extend from [[Boon Lay MRT Station|Boon Lay Station]] on the western end of the [[East West MRT Line|East West Line]], with one station along Jurong West Street 63 between Jurong Street 61 and Pioneer Road North, and the second station at Joo Koon Circle, near the junction of Benoi Road and International Road.

The fully elevated line will cost about S$436 million. Construction commence in the second half of 2005 and is targeted for completion by 2009. The extension's alignment along Jurong West Street 63, Upper Jurong Road, and International Road required the acquisition of one full lot and eight part lots, totalling about 28,000 square metres of land.
