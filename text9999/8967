'''Hurricane Hiki''' was the [[List of wettest tropical cyclones in the United States|wettest]] [[tropical cyclone]] on record in the [[United States]].{{Tropical Cyclone Point Maxima}} It was also considered the first official hurricane in the vicinity of the [[Hawaiian Islands]]. The fourth [[tropical cyclone]] of the [[1950 Pacific hurricane season]], Hiki formed as a tropical depression to the southeast of [[Hawaii (island)|Hawaii]] on August&nbsp;12. On the following day, the depression headed northwestward and intensified into Tropical Storm Hiki. While paralleling the Hawaiian Islands on August&nbsp;16, Hiki strengthened into a hurricane. Around that time, the storm peaked with [[maximum sustained wind]]s of 85&nbsp;mph (140&nbsp;km/h). The following day, Hiki curved southwestward on August&nbsp;17. Two days later, the hurricane resumed moving northwestward and weakened to a tropical storm shortly thereafter. Around midday on August&nbsp;21, Hiki weakened to a tropical depression and dissipated about six hours later.

Although Hiki was a small tropical cyclone and bypassed Hawaii, heavy rainfall and strong winds were observed throughout the islands. At the Kanalohuluhulu Ranger Station on [[Kauai]], {{convert|52|in|mm}} of precipitation was observed, which was the highest total associated with a tropical cyclone on record in the United States. The [[Waimea River (Hawaii)|Waimea River]] overflowed, causing more than 200&nbsp;residents to flee their homes. Many streets and several hundred acres of sugar cane fields were flooded. About $200,000 (1950&nbsp;[[United States dollar|USD]]) in damage was reported due to flooding in the city of Waimea. In [[Kekaha, Hawaii|Kekaha]], the powerhouse suffered severe damage. Throughout the islands, winds de-roofed several homes and downed power lines; one fatality occurred after a person came in contact with a [[Live wire (electricity)|live wire]].

==Meteorological history==
According to ship reports during the summer, the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]] was farther north than usual, which created favorable conditions for [[tropical cyclogenesis]].<ref name="Simpson">{{cite report|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/.U4pq9vRDtpc|title=Hiki<U+2014>Hawaii's First Hurricane of Record|coauthors=Robert H. Simpson|date=December 1950|publisher=[[National Weather Service|United States Weather Bureau]]|pages=127|accessdate=May 31, 2014}}</ref> Weather charts at the [[Honolulu International Airport]], a tropical depression developed at 00:00&nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]] on August&nbsp;12, while located about {{convert|760|mi|km}} southeast of the [[Hawaii (island)|Big Island]].{{EPAC hurricane best track}}<ref name="Hikireport"/> Thereafter, the storm gradually intensified, becoming a tropical storm at 06:00&nbsp;UTC on August&nbsp;13. It was named ''Hiki'', which is [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]] for ''Able''. While situated east of [[Hilo, Hawaii]], the system was described as an "immature storm", and had a very small diameter. Shortly thereafter, a [[reconnaissance aircraft]] flew into Hiki and estimated that sustained wind speeds between 50 and 60&nbsp;mph (80 and 100&nbsp;km/h). Further intensification continued and the system strengthened into a hurricane on August&nbsp;16.<ref name="Hikireport">{{cite report|accessdate=2007-01-26|author=Central Pacific Hurricane Center|url=http://www.prh.noaa.gov/cphc/summaries/1900-52.php|title=Tropical Cyclones During the Years 1900-1952|publisher=United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Weather Service|location=Honolulu, Hawaii}}</ref> Upon reaching hurricane intensity on August&nbsp;16, Hiki simultaneously attained its maximum sustained wind speed of 85&nbsp;mph (140&nbsp;km/h).{{EPAC hurricane best track}} Despite this, the storm had remained small, with gale force winds extending less than {{Convert|150|mi|km|abbr=on|disp=5}} from the center. Hiki remained between 100 and 200&nbsp;mi (160 and 320&nbsp;km) offshore while paralleling several Hawaiian Islands, including Hawaii, [[Maui]], [[Molokai]], [[Oahu]], and [[Kauai]].<ref name="Hikireport"/>

As a [[High-pressure area|high pressure]] [[Ridge (meteorology)|ridge]] intensified, the northwestward movement of Hiki was blocked, causing the storm to briefly turn due west on August&nbsp;17. The high pressure ridge eventually influenced the hurricane to re-curve southwestward. On August&nbsp;18, a reconnaissance aircraft observed sustained winds of 90&nbsp;mph (150&nbsp;km/h) to the south of the center; a minimum [[barometric pressure]] of {{convert|982|mbar|inHg|abbr=on|lk=on}} was also observed. After the reconnaissance aircraft flight into the storm on August&nbsp;18, residents of Kauai and Oahu were alerted of a possible cyclonic loop. However, later that day, the high pressure ridge weakened, causing Hiki to turned westward and pass south of [[French Frigate Shoals]] and [[Midway Island]].<ref name="Hikireport"/> Late on August&nbsp;19, Hiki weakened to a tropical storm and then  resumed its course to the northwest. By August 21, Hiki further weakened to a tropical depression, and dissipated six hours later.{{EPAC hurricane best track}}

==Preparations and impact==
{{Wettest tropical cyclones in Hawaii|align=right}}
Hiki was one of the strongest tropical cyclones to approach the Hawaiian Islands in at least 45&nbsp;years and officially the first hurricane in the region.<ref name="Simpson"/> As Hiki approached, a [[United States Coast Guard]] station with 14&nbsp;people in [[French Frigate Shoals]] was alerted. In addition, ships in the area were also advised to take caution. Hiki caused high waves on some of the Hawaiian Islands.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=DGE0AAAAIBAJ&sjid=uesFAAAAIBAJ&pg=4398,95803&dq=hurricane&hl=en|title=Hurricane Develops Off Hawaiian Islands|agency=[[International News Service]]|date=August 16, 1950|newspaper=[[The Miami News]]|accessdate=May 9, 2014|location=Honolulu, Hawaii}}</ref> Hawaii remained on the southern semicircle of Hiki, and as a result, light wind damage occurred. The highest reported winds from Hiki was at the [[Kilauea Light]]house on [[Kauai]], where gusts up to {{convert|68|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} were observed. The islands of [[Niihau]] and [[Lanai]] also experienced tropical storm force winds, reaching 48 and 50&nbsp;mph (77 and 80&nbsp;km/h), respectively. As a result, several houses throughout the Hawaiian Islands lost their roof. In addition, a farmer in [[Kohala, Hawaii|Kohala]] on Hawaii died after coming into contact with a live wire that was blown down from high winds.<ref name="Hikireport"/>

Hiki was the wettest tropical cyclone in United States history, as rainfall of over {{convert|52|in|mm|abbr=on}} observed at the Kanalohuluhulu Ranger Station on Kauai between August&nbsp;14 and August 18.<ref name="WPCMAX"/><ref name="Hikireport"/> The rain gauge was capable of holding {{convert|24|in|mm}} of the rain and was emptied on August&nbsp;15. However, less than 24&nbsp;hours later, the same rain gauge was overflowing. Heavy precipitation was also recorded on other locations on that island, including {{convert|13|in|mm}} on [[Mount Waialeale]]. Few reports exist on rainfall totals on other Hawaiian Islands, with the only other island recording rainfall was [[Maui]], with precipitation reaching {{Convert|11.9|in|mm}} on August&nbsp;15. This was the highest 24&nbsp;hour record for that island in the month of August.<ref name="Hikireport"/> On Kauai, the [[Waimea River (Hawaii)|Waimea River]] experienced one of the worst flood in its history, causing more than 200&nbsp;residents in [[Waimea Valley]] to evacuate. The river also rose near the mouth of its tributary, the Makaweli River, flooding the town of Waimea, causing about $200,000 in damage.<ref name="USGS">{{cite report|url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/wsp/1137c/report.pdf|title=Flood of August 1950 in the Waimea area Kauai, Hawaii|author=R.
