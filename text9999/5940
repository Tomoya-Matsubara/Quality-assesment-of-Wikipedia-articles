The '''Navajo Reservoir''' is a [[reservoir]] located in the northwest area of [[New Mexico]] and the southwest area of [[Colorado]], in the [[United States]]. 

The reservoir was created by damming the [[San Juan River (Utah)|San Juan River]]. The Navajo Dam was completed in 1963 after five years of construction. It was intended to be as one of four storage units in the Colorado River Storage Project and was not constructed to generate power. The dam is an earth dam with a crest elevation of 6108 ft and a structural height of 402 ft.

It is fed by the San Juan River, [[Piedra River]] and the [[Los Pinos River]], which help maintain the water level for [[irrigation]]. The reservoir is also used for flood control and can take more water than it usually holds.
