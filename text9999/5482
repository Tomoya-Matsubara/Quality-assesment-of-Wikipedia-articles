'''Node (autonomous system)''', the behaviour of a [[Autonomous system (mathematics)|linear autonomous system]] around a critical point is a node if the following conditions are satisifed:

Each path converges to the critical as <math> t \rightarrow \infty </math> (or as <math> t \rightarrow - \infty </math>). Furthermore, each path approaches the point asymptotically through a line. <ref> George F. Simmons, Differential equations with applications and historical notes, Second edition.
