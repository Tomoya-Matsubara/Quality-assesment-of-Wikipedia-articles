The '''collared brown lemur''' (''Eulemur collaris''), also known as the '''red-collared brown lemur''' or '''red-collared lemur''', is a medium-sized [[Strepsirrhini|strepsirrhine]] [[primate]] and one of twelve species of [[True lemur|brown lemur]] in the [[Lemuridae]] family.  It is only found in south-eastern [[Madagascar]].  Like most species of [[lemur]], it is [[arboreal]], moving [[quadruped]]ally and occasionally leaping from tree to tree.  Like other brown lemurs, it lives in social groups, primarily eats fruit, is active both day and night, exhibits [[sexual dichromatism]], and does not demonstrate [[Matriarchy|female dominance]].  The species is listed as ''Vulnerable'' by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) and is threatened primarily by [[Habitat destruction|habitat loss]].

==Taxonomy==
Together with the twelve other [[true lemur]]s (genus ''Eulemur''),{{r|2008MittermeierGroves}} the collared brown lemur (''E. collaris'') is a type of [[lemur]]  belonging to the family [[Lemuridae]].  Collectively, lemurs (infraorder Lemuriformes) are classified as [[Strepsirrhini|strepsirrhine]] [[primate]]s.  Originally listed as a subspecies of the [[common brown lemur]] (''E. fulvus''), the collared brown lemur was promoted to full species status in 2001 by [[Biological anthropology|biological anthropologist]] [[Colin Groves]].{{r|MSW3}}

==Anatomy and physiology==
An adult collared brown lemur can reach a head-body length of {{convert|39|and|40|cm|in|abbr=on}} and have a tail length of {{convert|50|and|55|cm|in|abbr=on}} for an overall length of {{convert|89|and|95|cm|in|abbr=on}}.  It has an average body weight of {{convert|2.25|and|2.5|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, making it a medium-sized lemur.{{r|2006Mittermeier|2007Garbutt}}  The only form of [[sexual dimorphism]] exhibited by the collared brown lemur is [[sexual dichromatism|dichromatism]].  The following table illustrates the coloration differences between the sexes:

[[File:Eulemur collaris AGrandidier 0833.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Illustration of female (top) and male (bottom) heads, seen from the right. Female is mostly gray with some rufous-brown coloration on the cheeks. Males has mostly dark gray or black muzzle, face, and crown; as well as thick and bushy rufous-brown cheeks and beard. Both have big ears and a long snout|Collared brown lemurs:<br>Female (top) and male (bottom)<br>(Illustration from 1892)]]
In the wild, the collared brown lemur's range does not overlap with other brown lemurs, so it is rarely confused with other species.{{r|2007Garbutt}}  However, in captivity it can be easily confused with the [[gray-headed lemur]] (''Eulemur cinereiceps'') due to similar coloration.  The male collared brown lemur can be distinguished by their cream-colored or rufous beards, whereas the male gray-headed lemur has a white beard.  Females of these two species are nearly indistinguishable, even though genetic analyses support full species status for both taxa.{{r|2006Mittermeier}}

==Ecology==
Found in tropical moist lowland and montane forests in southeastern Madagascar, the collared brown lemur occurs west to the forests of [[Kalambatritra Reserve|Kalambatritra]] and in the south from [[T<U+00F4>lanaro]] north to the [[Mananara River]].{{r|IUCN|2006Mittermeier|2007Garbutt}} The Mananara River is the boundary between the ranges of the collared brown lemur and the Gray-headed Lemur to the north. The collared brown lemur can be seen in the [[Mandena Conservation Zone]], [[Saint Luce Private Reserve]], and [[Andohahela National Park]].{{r|2006Mittermeier}}

In its environment, the collared brown lemur acts as a [[Seed dispersal|seed disperser]], and is especially critical for the dispersal of large-seeded fruiting trees within its range.{{r|2004Bollen}}  However, there is no evidence that these relationships are [[coevolution]]ary and instead these lemurs may be the last remaining seed dispersers for these tree species following the extinction of larger [[Frugivore|frugivorous]] birds and [[subfossil lemur]]s.{{r|2004Bollen_a}}

==Behavior==
Very little is known about this species.  It is thought to primarily eat fruit, like most other true lemurs.{{r|2006Mittermeier}}  It is also [[cathemeral]] (active both day and night throughout the year), a trait seen in some other members of its genus.{{r|2006Mittermeier|2007Garbutt}}  Research has suggested that metabolic dietary-related needs are the leading factor behind this behavior, although the specific hours of this activity pattern can shift based on [[Moon|lunar]] [[luminosity]] and seasonal changes in the [[Photoperiodism|photoperiod]] (day length).{{r|2009Donatia}}  Previous studies had ruled out effects of predators on the expression of this trait, and instead pointed to fruit availability and fiber intake as more important factors.{{r|2007Donatia}}

The collared brown lemur tends to live in social groups that are multi-male/multi-female,{{r|2006Mittermeier}} with groups ranging in size from three to seven.{{r|2007Garbutt}}  Population densities are estimated at 14 individuals/km<sup>2</sup>, and it appears to be common within its range.{{r|2006Mittermeier}}  Females give birth to one offspring between October and December, and male involvement with the young has been observed.{{r|2007Garbutt}}  [[Matriarchy|Female dominance]], a common behavioral trait in many lemur species but uncommon in most [[true lemur]]s, has not been observed in this species.{{r|2006Mittermeier|1999Sussman}}

The collared brown lemur was listed as ''Vulnerable'' (VU A2cd) in the 2008 IUCN Red List assessment.{{r|IUCN}} Its greatest threat is [[Habitat destruction|habitat loss]] from [[Slash and burn|slash-and-burn agriculture]] and [[charcoal]] production.  It is also hunted for food and captured for the local pet trade.{{r|2006Mittermeier}}  Populations of the collared brown lemur have been successfully sustained in captivity as a safeguard against their extinction.{{r|ISIS}}

A small group of collared brown lemurs was introduced in the 1980s into the [[Berenty Reserve|Berenty Private Reserve]] and has since [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridized]] with [[introduced species|introduced]] [[red-fronted lemur]]s.{{r|2006Mittermeier}}
