'''Anthony (Tony) Steven Christiansen''' (born 23 October 1958) is a world-leading motivational and [[inspirational speaker]]. He authored the best-sellers Race You To The Top,<ref name="Race"/> Attitude Plus!<ref name="Attitude"/> and Don't Just Sit There. 

In his presentations, he exudes a strong presence and speaks with clarity and purpose, and eliminates redundant words.<ref name="NZToday"/> Christiansen starts by climbing a 1.5-metre high scaffolding, a show that leaves his audience gobsmacked.<ref name="Course"/>

The basis of Christiansen's presentation is self belief;<ref name="Davidson"/> the theme is simply "Your attitude determines your altitude in life".<ref name="Smale"/> Christiansen has no legs, a result of a horrific train accident when he was a child yet has achieved remarkable feats in his life. He shares his life story and the secrets to his success<ref name="Course"/> and encourages his audience to set their own challenges, rather than accept the limitations imposed by their own attitudes and other people's perception.<ref name="Attitude"/> 

== Early Life <ref name="Race"/> ==
Christiansen was born in [[Tauranga]], [[New Zealand]]. His father Bernard worked in a timber yard and his mother Doreen was a homemaker who immigrated to [[New Zealand]] from [[England]] after the [[World War II]]. He is the youngest of 3 siblings which include brother Frank and sister Susan. [[Image:Sitting_up_in_hospital.jpg|thumb|alt=Tony Christiansen day after his accident.|Christiansen days after his accident.]]


=== Hit By A Train ===
On the morning of 3 June 1967 which was [[Queen's Birthday]] weekend, Christiansen had followed friend Gary Winters and his father Mick to the railway yard near Te Maunga to bag coal for sale to raise money for charity. As the 2 children were crossing the tracks, the train shunted backwards dragging Christiansen under and the dual set of wheels ran over his legs almost severing them.<ref name="Accident"/> 

As a result of this accident, both his legs could not be saved and were amputated. 48 hours after the accident, Christiansen was found sitting up in a wheelchair and in good spirits.<ref name="Accident"/> 


== Extraordinary Achievements ==
Christiansen very quickly got on with life after his wounds healed. His extraordinary achievements following the accident made him [[New Zealand]]'s most notable [[motivational speaker]]<ref name="Ashburton"/> and one of the world's most interesting.<ref name="NZToday"/> 


=== Confidence in the Water ===
After his accident, many people including strangers, visited Christiansen and wanted to help. Among them, 2 people made a significant difference to Christiansen<U+2019>s life. They were swimming coaches Dave Franklin and Allan Guthrie.<ref name="McCaroll"/>

Even before his accident, Christiansen hated water but Franklin and Guthrie were very persistent in teaching the now disabled young boy how to swim. Within 5 months of his first lesson, less than a year after his accident, Christiansen at 10 years of age, swam a mile non-stop.<ref name="Swim1"/>

The following year, Christiansen joined the [[Tauranga]] Swimming Club and continued to improve as a swimmer while he became physically stronger. He set a goal to compete in the [[Tauranga]] mayor<U+2019>s annual sponsored swimming race held by the [[Lions Club]].

On 6 May 1971, Christiansen came just behind the mayor Bob Owen in that 2-mile race <ref name="Swim"/> and in February 1974, he beat the mayor in the Annual Harbour <U+201C>Swimathon<U+201D>.<ref name="SwimChairman"/>


[[Image:Tony_Christiansen_-_Inspirational_Speaker_@_Surf_Lifesaver.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Tony Christiansen World Life Saving Award.|Article in [[Sunday News]] about Christiansen's World Life Saving award. {{deletable image-caption}}]] 
=== Surf Lifesaving ===
During his years in school, Christiansen was alienated from most of the physical activities. In his fifth form, week-long school camps were held, none of which he could participate in. As a result, his old swimming coach Dave Franklin invited him to join the surf lifesaving camp at the Omanu surf club. By the end of that week, Christiansen earned his surf lifesaving [[Bronze Medallion (New Zealand and Australia)]] <ref name="Lifesaver"/><ref name="NZHerald1"/> and joined the Omanu Pacific Surf Lifesaving Club. 

In 1978, Christiansen was granted a Special Achievement Award from World Life Saving <ref name="Lifesaver"/><ref name="Award"/> which today is known as the [[International Life Saving Federation]]. In the same year, he gained his instructor<U+2019>s certificate.<ref name="Award"/>

Christiansen remained a member of the Omanu Pacific Surf Lifesaving Club and worked as a surf lifeguard until the age of 23. He was also the club's canoe team captain.<ref name="Lifesaver"/> Throughout his career as a surf lifesaver, Christiansen made 33 rescues.<ref name="NZToday"/><ref name="McCaroll"/> He was believed to be the only paraplegic lifeguard in the Southern Hemisphere.<ref name="FESPIC"/>

=== Athletics Career & Representing New Zealand ===
Around the same time Christiansen got into surf lifesaving, he also become involved in the disabled sports movement. It wasn<U+2019>t long before he set a goal to represent [[New Zealand]] internationally.<ref name="ThatsLife"/> 

Christiansen trained for the National Disabled Games in Wellington and competed in wheelchair racing, [[shot put]], [[discus]], [[javelin]] and [[swimming]]. In 1972, he was nominated for a New Zealand Herald Junior Sports Award which he did not win but was recognized by the judges who included Yvette Corlett (1952 Olympic long jump champion), [[Murray Halberg]] and [[Don Oliver]].<ref name="NZHerald"/> In 1976, he was nominated again and this time he won the award for paraplegic sports.<ref name="NZHerald1"/>

During his career in athletics, Christiansen held several local records and was the area pentathlon champion in 1978.<ref name="Lifesaver"/> 

Christiansen<U+2019>s other international sports achievements include: 
* [[FESPIC Games]], [[Oita]] [[Japan]] 1975 - Gold in [[javelin]] and 50 metres [[freestyle swimming]]; Silver in 100 metres wheelchair dash.<ref name="FESPIC"/><ref name="FESPIC1"/>

[[Image:Tony_Christiansen_-_Inspirational_Speaker_@_Signwriting.jpg<U+200E> |thumb|left|alt=Tony Christiansen Signwriting.|Christiansen at his best trade as a signwriter.]] 


=== The Successful Business<ref name="Race"/> ===
In the book about his life, Race You To The Top, Christiansen described his performance in school as <U+201C>having artistic talent but never very academic<U+201D>. 

While at school, Christiansen worked part-time doing signwriting jobs on stockcars and the same for [[Woolworths]]. These credentials later led to a job as a ticket writer in [[New World (supermarket)]]. At the same time, he also worked for the Tauranga Museum where he learned many new skills.<ref name="ThatsLife"/>

Christiansen tried applying for jobs with signwriting companies but his numerous attempts failed. He eventually hassled Lance Styles, the owner of Commercial Signs, enough to land a job. Within 3 months, he had proven himself and impressed Styles who made him foreman. 

Christiansen later left Commercial Signs. In 1985, he returned and took a stake in the company. In 1995, he bought over the rest of the shareholding and became the sole owner of the company. For the next 2 years, he turned it into one of the largest commercial signwriting business in New Zealand and sold it in 1997 <ref name="NZToday"/> to begin his career as a professional speaker.

=== Pilot & Aviation History ===
Christiansen<U+2019>s introduction to aviation started with radio-controlled planes which remains a passionate hobby.<ref name="Race"/>  He had met and was taught to fly by Phil Hooker, the Bay of Plenty Flight Centre<U+2019>s chief flying instructor<ref name="Aviation"/><ref name="Aviation1"/>  whom Christiansen taught to fly radio-controlled planes.<ref name="Aviation"/><ref name="Aviation2"/>

On 24 March 1998,<ref name="Race"/> Christiansen created aviation history when he became the first disabled New Zealander to fly solo.<ref name="McCaroll"/><ref name="Aviation2"/> According to a Civil Aviation Authority spokeswoman, Christiansen was the first person who had learned to fly from scratch with a disability.<ref name="Aviation2"/>




== More Recent Achievements ==
=== Kilimanjaro<ref name="Attitude"/> ===
[[Image:Tony_Christiansen_-_Inspirational_Speaker_@_Climbing_Kilimanjaro.jpg|thumb|alt=Tony Christiansen climbing Mount Kilimanjaro.|Christiansen at the summit of [[Mount Kilimanjaro]].]] 
In 2002, Christiansen was invited by [[Korean Broadcasting System]] to scale [[Mount Kilimanjaro]] with 2 other Koreans <U+2013> Soo Young, a blind young woman and Hong Bin, an experienced mountaineer who lost all his fingers to frostbite on a climbing expedition in [[Canada]].<ref name="Kilimanjaro"/>

After about 2 weeks of preparations and media interviews in [[Korea]], the group departed for [[Dar es Salaam]], [[Nairobi]] and travelled onwards to [[Arusha]] in northern [[Tanzania]]. They spent 3 days filming in a village with the [[Masai people]]. 

Christiansen climbed Mount Kilimanjaro in his mountain-climbing wheelchair as much as he could and the rest of the journey on his backside with only a pair of hi-tech, New Zealand-designed vinyl pants and a pair of gloves protecting him from the sharp volcanic rocks.<ref name="Kilimanjaro"/>

The group reached the summit of the mountain on 21 December 2002. Christiansen reached Gilman<U+2019>s Point, the second highest peak at 5,685 metres. He did not reach Uhuru, the highest peak at 5,895 metres as he admitted in his book that he could not physically go on through the incredibly steep and rough terrain at the summit. It was also snowing and raining and it was getting dark, all making it too dangerous to carry on.

It took Christiansen 10 hours to reach Gilman<U+2019>s Point from Kibo Hut which is the last station on the [[Mount_Kilimanjaro_climbing_routes#Marangu_Route|Marangu Route]], and only 2 hours to descent. 

Christiansen<U+2019>s [[Kilimanjaro]] experience is told in detail in his second book <U+201C>Attitude Plus!<U+201D>.<ref name="Otago"/> He considers his climb to the summit of Mount Kilimanjaro one of his proudest moment.<ref name="CHC"/>


[[Image:Tony_Christiansen_-_Inspirational_Speaker_@_Bonneville_Worlds_Fastest_Amputee.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Tony Christiansen attempts to be the World's Fastest Amputee at the Bonneville Salt Flats.|Christiansen at the [[Bonneville Salt Flats]] with his dragster.]] 

=== World<U+2019>s Fastest Amputee ===
In 2008, having watched the movie <U+201C>[[The World's Fastest Indian]]<U+201D> 27 times on Air New Zealand flights, Christiansen was inspired to become <U+201C>The World<U+2019>s Fastest Amputee<U+201D>.<ref name="Bonneville"/><ref name="Bonneville1"/> He set a goal to attempt to reach 200&nbsp;mph (321 kph) on the famed [[Bonneville Salt Flats]] in [[Utah]], [[USA]].<ref name="Bonneville"/>

He set about modifying his C/Altered drag racer designed for a quarter mile strip into a salt flats racer that will run 8 miles (13&nbsp;km) on the vast salt flats.<ref name="Bonneville"/>

Christiansen's efforts were filmed by [[TV NZ]] for a documentary programme which captured the emotional highs and lows of his Speedweek venture. He did not achieve this targeted speed of 200&nbsp;mph, instead topped at 182&nbsp;mph (293 kph).<ref name="Bonneville2"/> 






== Politics ==
Christiansen was a candidate for the [[Bay of Plenty (New Zealand electorate)]] for the Kiwi Party in the 2008 General Election. He did not win the seat, garnering only 2,258 votes, losing to incumbent [[Tony Ryall]].<ref name="Politics"/>

Christiansen is currently running for a seat in the Tauranga City Council<ref name="Politics1"/> and is expected to have a good chance of winning.<ref name="Politics2"/>
