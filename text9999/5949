'''Earvin''' "'''Magic'''" '''Johnson, Jr.''' (born August 14, 1959) is a retired American professional [[basketball]] player who played [[point guard]] for the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) for 13 seasons.

He won a championship and an [[Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award|NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award]] in his rookie season, and won four more championships with the Lakers during the 1980s. Johnson retired abruptly in 1991 after announcing that he had contracted [[HIV]], but returned to play in the [[1992 NBA All-Star Game|1992 All-Star Game]], winning the [[NBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player Award|All-Star MVP Award]]. After protests from his fellow players, he retired again for four years, but returned in 1996, at age 36, to play 32&nbsp;games for the Lakers before retiring for the third and final time.

Johnson's career achievements include three [[NBA Most Valuable Player Award|NBA MVP Awards]], nine [[NBA Finals]] appearances, twelve [[List of NBA All-Stars|All-Star]] games, and ten [[All-NBA Team|All-NBA]] First and Second Team nominations.

Johnson's mother spent many hours after work each night cleaning their home and preparing the next day's meals, while his father did janitorial work at a used car lot and collected garbage, all while never missing a day at General Motors. Earvin Jr. would often help his father on the garbage route, and he was teased by neighborhood children who called him "Garbage Man."<ref name=siblings>Danois, Alejandro.

Johnson grew up in Lansing, and came to love basketball as a youngster. His favorite basketball player was [[Bill Russell]], whom he admired more for his many championships than his athletic ability.<ref name=bill>Roselius, Chris J.

There were incidents of racism, with rocks being thrown at buses carrying black students, and white parents refusing to send their children to school. Larry was kicked off the basketball team after a confrontation during practice, prompting him to beg Earvin not to play. Johnson did join the basketball team but became angry after several days when his new teammates ignored him during practice, not even passing the ball. He nearly got into a fight with another player before head coach George Fox intervened. Eventually Johnson accepted his situation, and the small group of black students looked to him as their leader.<ref name=mylife /> When recalling the events in his autobiography, ''My Life'', he talked about how his time at Everett  had changed him:

<blockquote>As I look back on it today, I see the whole picture very differently. It's true that I hated missing out on Sexton. And the first few months, I was miserable  at Everett. But being bused to Everett turned to be one of the best things that ever happened to me.

HIV had been associated with drug addicts and homosexuals,<ref name="lifeafterdeath" /> but Johnson's campaigns sought to show that the risk of infection was not limited to those groups.

===Rivalry with Larry Bird===
[[Image:Magic Bird Lipofsky.jpg|thumb|upright|Johnson battling with Bird for rebounding position in Game 2 of the 1985 NBA Finals at [[Boston Garden]].]]
{{See also|Lakers<U+2013>Celtics rivalry}}

Johnson and [[Larry Bird]] were first linked as rivals after Johnson's Michigan State squad defeated Bird's Indiana State team in the 1979 [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] finals. The rivalry continued in the NBA, and reached its climax when Boston and Los Angeles met in three out of four NBA Finals from 1984 to 1987. Johnson asserted that for him, the 82-game regular season was composed of 80 normal games, and two Lakers<U+2013>Celtics games. Similarly, Bird admitted that Johnson's daily [[box score]] was the first thing he checked in the morning.<ref name="magiclarryquotes" />

Several journalists hypothesized that the Johnson<U+2013>Bird rivalry was so appealing because it represented many other contrasts, such as the clash between the Lakers and Celtics, between Hollywood flashiness ("Showtime") and Boston/Indiana [[Blue-collar worker|blue collar]] grit ("Celtic Pride"), and between blacks and whites.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bork|first=Gunter|title=Basketball Sternstunden|year=1995|pages=49<U+2013>55}} ISBN 376790456X.</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/web/COM1057184/1/index.htm|title=The Stuff Dreams Are Made Of|last=Halberstam|first=David|date=1987-06-29|work=Sports Illustrated|publisher=Time Inc|accessdate=2008-05-12}}</ref> The rivalry was also significant because it drew national attention to the faltering NBA. Prior to Johnson and Bird's arrival, the NBA had gone through a decade of declining interest and low TV ratings.<ref>Neal, Rome. {{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/09/26/earlyshow/leisure/main523385.shtml|title='Magic' Time|publisher=''www.cbsnews.com''|date=200-02-11|accessdate=2013-10-13}}</ref> With the two future Hall of Famers, the league won a whole generation of new fans,<ref name="cbc">{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2002/08/14/magic020814.html|title=Larry Bird inducting Magic Johnson|publisher=''www.cbc.ca''|date=2002-08-15|accessdate=2008-05-08}}</ref> drawing both traditionalist adherents of Bird's dirt court Indiana game and those appreciative of Johnson's public park flair. According to sports journalist Larry Schwartz of ESPN, Johnson and Bird saved the NBA from [[bankruptcy]].<ref name="espnshowtime" />

Despite their on-court rivalry, Johnson and Bird became close friends during the filming of a 1984 [[Converse (company)|Converse]] shoe advertisement that depicted them as enemies.<ref>{{cite book|last=Aamidor|first=Abraham|title=Chuck Taylor, All Star: The True Story of the Man Behind the Most Famous Athletic Shoe in History|year=2006|page=151|isbn=0-253-34698-3}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/sportscentury/features/00014103.html|title=Eye for victory|last=Schwartz|first=Larry|publisher=''www.espn.com''|accessdate=2009-02-28}}</ref> Johnson appeared at Bird's retirement ceremony in 1992, and described Bird as a "friend forever";<ref name="magiclarryquotes">{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/history/Classic_NBA_Quotes_Magic_and_Larry.html|title=Classic NBA Quotes: Magic and Larry|publisher=''NBA Encyclopedia: Playoff Edition''|accessdate=2007-09-13}}</ref> during Johnson's Hall of Fame ceremony, Bird formally inducted his old rival.<ref name="cbc" />

Retrieved May 21, 2013.</ref> Buss acquired the team from [[Jack Kent Cooke]] in 1979, shortly before he drafted Johnson with the #1 pick in the [[1979 NBA Draft]]. In addition to playing 13 seasons for the Lakers and coaching the team briefly in 1994, Johnson also had an ownership stake in the team for nearly twenty years. Buss took a special interest in Johnson, introducing him to important Los Angeles business contacts and showing him how the Lakers organization was run, before eventually selling Johnson a stake in the team in 1994.<ref name=jbuss /> Johnson credits Buss with giving him the business knowledge that enabled him to become part owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers.<ref name=jbuss /><ref name=doctor>[http://msn.foxsports.com/nba/story/magic-johnson-says-jerry-buss-made-him-man-he-is-today-021913 "Magic Johnson says Jerry Buss made him man he is today."] ''www.msn.foxsports.com'', February 20, 2013. Retrieved May 22, 2013.</ref>

Buss supported Johnson as he revealed his diagnosis of HIV in 1991, and he never hesitated to keep Johnson close to the organization, bringing him in as part-owner, and even as a coach.
Johnson had never seriously considered coaching, but he agreed take the head coaching position with the Lakers in 1994 at Buss' request. In 1992, Buss had given Johnson a contract that paid him $14 million a year, as payback for all the years he was not the league's highest paid player. Although Johnson's retirement prior to the [[1992<U+2013>93 NBA season]] voided this contract, Buss insisted that he still be paid.<ref name=jbuss /> It was this arrangement that allowed Johnson to coach the team without receiving any additional salary.<ref name=brief /><ref name=father /> After Johnson ended his coaching stint, Buss sold him a 4% stake in the Lakers for $10 million, and Johnson served as a team executive.<ref name=jbuss />
