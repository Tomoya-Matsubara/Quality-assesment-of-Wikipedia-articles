'''M-35''' is a [[Michigan highway system|state trunkline highway]] in the [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan|Upper Peninsula]] (UP) of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Michigan]]. Running for {{convert|127.99|mi|km|lk=on|}} in a general north&ndash;south direction, it connects the cities of [[Menominee, Michigan|Menominee]], [[Escanaba, Michigan|Escanaba]] and [[Negaunee, Michigan|Negaunee]]. The southern section of M-35 in [[Menominee County, Michigan| Menominee]] and [[Delta County, Michigan|Delta]] Counties carries two additional designations. M-35 forms a segment of the [[Lake Michigan Circle Tour]], and it is the '''UP Hidden Coast Recreational Heritage Trail''', which is a part of the [[Michigan Heritage Route]]s system. Along the southern section, the highway is the closest trunkline to the [[Bay of Green Bay]], a section of [[Lake Michigan]], and is also the shortest route between Menominee and Escanaba. The northern section of the highway turns inland through wooded terrain, connecting rural portions of Delta and [[Marquette County, Michigan|Marquette]] Counties.

M-35 is an original state trunkline that was first designated on [[1 July]] [[1919]], originally intended to run from Menominee in the south to near [[Big Bay, Michigan|Big Bay]] in the north, before turning toward [[L'Anse, Michigan|L'Anse]] to end at [[Ontonagon, Michigan|Ontonagon]]. However, the section through the [[Huron Mountains]] in northern Marquette and [[Baraga County, Michigan|Baraga]] Counties was never built. Automobile pioneer [[Henry Ford]] helped halt this construction to gain favor with and membership in the exclusive [[Huron Mountain Club]]. Some discontinuous sections were later ceded to local control. The northern segment of the route between Ontonagon and [[Baraga, Michigan|Baraga]] was retained as a discontinuous segment of the highway; this northern segment was redesignated as another state trunkline. The northern end was rerouted out of the City of Negaunee into [[Negaunee Township, Michigan|Negaunee Township]] to avoid mining activity near [[Palmer, Michigan|Palmer]].

==Route description==
M-35 is primarily a two-lane roadway, with the exception of the {{convert|8.42|mi|km|2|adj=on}} section between [[Escanaba, Michigan|Escanaba]] and [[Gladstone, Michigan|Gladstone]].<ref name="CGI"/> This section is a four-lane [[divided highway]] that runs [[Concurrency (road)|concurrently]] with [[U.S Route 2 (Michigan)|US&nbsp;Highway&nbsp;2]]/[[U.S. Route 41 (Michigan)|US&nbsp;Highway&nbsp;41]] (US&nbsp;2/US&nbsp;41).<ref name="MDOT07"/> M-35 is also listed on the [[National Highway System (United States)|National Highway System]] along the US&nbsp;2/US&nbsp;41 concurrency.<ref name="NHS">{{cite web | title=National Highway System, Michigan | date=[[2006-04-23]] | work=[[Michigan Department of Transportation]] | url= http://www.michigan.gov/documents/MDOT_NHS_Statewide_150626_7.pdf | accessdate=2008-02-04 |format=pdf}}</ref> The southern terminus is in the [[Menominee, Michigan|City of Menominee]].

===Menominee to Gladstone===
The southern terminus of M-35 is north of downtown Menominee, at the corner of 10th&nbsp;Street (US&nbsp;41) and North Shore Drive. It is a [[Fork in the road|Y-shaped intersection]] near John Henes Park. This park sits on {{convert|50|acre|ha|sigfig=2|lk=on}} of land, and it was donated to the City of Menominee by German<U+2013>American brewer John Henes in 1907.<ref name="huntsHP">{{cite book |author=Hunt, Mary and Hunt, Don |chapter=Henes Park |date=2007 |title=Hunt's Guide to Michigan's Upper Peninsula |publisher= Midwestern Guides |location=[[Albion, MI]] |url=http://hunts-upguide.com/ |chapterurl=http://hunts-upguide.com/menominee_and_marinette_henes_park.html |accessdate=2008-05-11}}</ref> M-35 leads northeast from the intersection before turning north to head out of town.

M-35 is the shortest state trunkline highway between Menominee and Escanaba. Under [[American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials]] (AASHTO) guidelines, [[United States Numbered Highways|US Highways]] are to follow the most direct path between two locations, but US&nbsp;41 runs inland and M-35 goes more directly up the Lake Michigan shoreline. According to the 2007 MDOT State Highway Map, the US&nbsp;41 route runs for {{convert|65|mi|km|0}} versus {{convert|55|mi|km|0}} for M-35.<ref name="MDOT07"/>

At the [[Menominee County, Michigan|Menominee]]<U+2013>[[Delta County, Michigan|Delta]] county line, M-35 passes from the [[Central Time Zone (North America)|Central]] to the [[Eastern Time Zone (North America)|Eastern Time Zone]].<ref name="MDOT07"/> After passing the south side of Escanaba, M-35 runs into town on Lake Shore Drive, passing to the south and east of the [[Delta County Airport]] before turning onto Lincoln Road. Just west of downtown, US&nbsp;2/US&nbsp;41 join M-35 at the intersection of Ludington Street and Lincoln Road. Ludington and Lincoln form the east<U+2013>west and north<U+2013>south axes respectively of the Escanaba street numbering grid.

===Gladstone to Negaunee===
[[Image:Palmer rock piles.JPG|thumb|right|[[Overburden|Waste rock]] piles from the Empire Mine along M-35 southbound approaching Palmer]]
M-35 turns northwesterly in Gladstone through northern Delta County and southern Marquette County and crosses the [[Days River]] in [[Brampton, Michigan|Brampton]]. From [[Perkins, Michigan|Perkins]] north, M-35 runs parallel to the [[Lake Superior and Ishpeming Railroad|Lake Superior & Ishpeming]] rail line between the iron mines of Marquette County and Escanaba. The station of Maple Ridge was located in the community of [[Rock, Michigan|Rock]] along this line. M-35 crosses into Marquette County in the unincorporated location of [[McFarland, Michigan|McFarland]] and crosses the rail line before reaching the [[Little Lake, Michigan|Little Lake]] in the community of the same name. The highway runs east<U+2013>west  through Little Lake to [[Gwinn, Michigan|Gwinn]].<ref name="MDOT07"/>

Built as a [[company town]] by the [[Cleveland-Cliffs Iron Company]], Gwinn is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] as the "Gwinn [[Planned community|Model Town]] [[Historic district (United States)|Historic District]], [[Forsyth Township, Michigan|Forsyth Township]], Marquette County, Michigan".<ref name="NRHP">{{cite web |  title=National Register of Historic Places - MICHIGAN (MI), Marquette County | date=[[2002-06-24]] | work=National Register of Historic Places | url=http://www.nationalregisterofhistoricplaces.com/MI/Marquette/districts.html | accessdate=2007-08-29 }}</ref> M-35 follows Stephenson Avenue through the neighborhood of New Swanzy westward to the community of Gwinn.

==History==
[[Image:M-35 1932.jpg|thumb|A section of the 1932 Michigan State Dept. of Highways road map showing M-35 in northern Marquette and Baraga counties<ref name="MSHD32"/>]]
When created on [[1 July]] [[1919]], M-35 was to run from [[M-12 (Michigan highway)|M-12]]/[[M-15 (Michigan highway)|M-15]] (modern US&nbsp;2/US&nbsp;41) at [[Gladstone, Michigan|Gladstone]] in the south to [[Palmer, Michigan|Palmer]] before terminating in [[Negaunee, Michigan|Negaunee]] at M-15 (modern US&nbsp;41). Most maps showed M-35 continuing north to L'Anse.<ref name="MSHD19"/><ref name="MSHD32"/> At the time of M-35's creation, another designation, [[M-91 (Michigan highway)|M-91]], was assigned to a highway from [[Menominee, Michigan|Menominee]] northward to [[Cedar River, Michigan|Cedar River]].<ref name="MSHD19">{{cite map |publisher= [[Michigan Department of Transportation|Michigan State Highway Department]] |title=State of Michigan |url=http://maps.lib.msu.edu/miroadmaps/mirm5.htm |year=1919 |cartography= MSHD |accessdate=2008-03-02 }}</ref> By 1930, M-35 was extended southerly along US&nbsp;2/US&nbsp;41 from Gladstone to [[Escanaba, Michigan|Escanaba]]. From there, M-35 continued as a new highway along the [[Bay of Green Bay]] shoreline to Cedar River and supplanted M-91.<ref name="ALA">{{cite book |author=Automobile Legal Association |title=Automobile Green Book |edition=1930/31 edition  |date=1930 |publisher=Scarborough Motor Guide Co. |location=Boston  |pages=pp.45+ | chapter=Route Log of State Highway Systems }}</ref>

===Huron Mountains===
In 1919, the State Department of Highways, forerunner to today's MDOT, designated a scenic shoreline trunkline to run north from Negaunee to [[Skanee, Michigan|Skanee]] and [[L'Anse, Michigan|L'Anse]] by way of [[Big Bay, Michigan|Big Bay]]. The highway would continue from the L'Anse and [[Baraga, Michigan|Baraga]] area to eventually end at [[Ontonagon, Michigan|Ontonagon]] at an intersection with [[M-64 (Michigan highway)|M-64]].<ref name="ALA"/> Local Upper Peninsula historian Fred Rydholm summarized the routing planned in 1925 as extending "...&nbsp;in a northwesterly direction, across the [[Dead River (Michigan)|Dead River]], over the Panorama Hills, then west past the Elm Creek swamp, along the south side of Burnt Mountain, across the Cedar Creek, the Cliff Stream and out past Cliff Lake to Skanee and L'Anse".<ref name="rydholm">{{cite book |last=Rydholm |first=C.

Work was completed on a significant portion of the route in [[Marquette County, Michigan|Marquette County]] by 1926. M-35 was routed east along M-15 toward [[Marquette, Michigan|Marquette]] before turning north-northwesterly toward Big Bay. This section of roadway follows the modern Marquette County&nbsp;Road&nbsp;510 (CR&nbsp;510). Similar work was completed in [[Baraga County, Michigan|Baraga County]] connecting L'Anse and Skanee by 1932.<ref name="MSHD32"/>

Construction on the two ends left the center portion through the [[Huron Mountains]] unfinished and shown on state maps as a dashed line marked "impassable".<ref name="MSHD32">{{cite map |publisher= [[Michigan Department of Transportation|Michigan State Highway Department]] |title= Michigan State Department of Highways Map |year=1932 |cartography= MSHD |accessdate=2008-03-02 }}</ref> The section not included in CR&nbsp;510, "the few miles of the road going to the [[Salmon Trout River]], complete with guard rails and cement culverts, has been known as 'Dead End 35' ever since", according to Rydholm.<ref name="rydholm"/>

===The Steel Bridge===
[[Image:CR510 steel bridge.jpg|thumb|right|The Steel Bridge carrying Marquette County Road 510 over the Dead River]]
One of the first tasks for the State Highway Department was bridging the Dead River in Negaunee Township, {{convert|3|mi|km|0}} north of US&nbsp;41.<ref name="hyde"> {{cite book |title=Historic Highway Bridges of Michigan |last=Hyde |first=Charles K.|year= 1993|publisher=Wayne State University Press |location=Detroit |isbn=0-8143-2448-7 |pages=pp.70<U+2013>72 }}</ref> The state solved the problem by buying a bridge in Pennsylvania, where bridges of this design were more common.<ref name="hyde"/> MDOT describes the bridge as:

===Henry Ford===
Records of the Huron Mountain Club, an exclusive private organization with large land holdings in northern Michigan, show that Henry Ford visited the Upper Peninsula many times, including at least once with [[Harvey Firestone]] and [[Thomas Edison]] on Ford's yacht, ''Sialia''. Many of these trips involved research to keep his operations supplied.<ref name="mayor">{{cite book |last=Mayor |first=Archer |editor= Dodge, Murray, ed. |others= Dykema, Rosemary, photography ed. |title=Huron Mountain Club: The First Hundred Years |year=1988 |publisher=Thompson-Shore |location=[[Dexter, Michigan]] |id=ASIN B0007BJB02 |pages=pp.88<U+2013>89}}</ref> His UP land provided wood for the manufacture of Ford automobiles such as the [[Model T]], which required {{convert|250|board feet|lk=on|sigfig=2}} of lumber per car.<ref name="rydholm"/> Ford, who was considering becoming the "owner<U+2013>producer<U+2013>handler" of the resources he needed, invested in [[sawmill]]s in [[Alberta, Michigan|Alberta]] and [[Kingsford, Michigan|Kingsford]]. He also bought the entire town of [[Pequaming, Michigan|Pequaming]], along the shores of the [[Keweenaw Bay]]. The town belonged to Charles Hebard, who also sold Ford a sawmill, [[tugboat]]s, a 14-room [[bungalow]], and land near the Huron Mountain Club. Hebard retired to spend his summers at a cabin on the Pine River on land belonging to the Club.<ref name="rydholm"/>

Ford built a [[hydroelectric dam]] along the [[Menominee River]] to supply power to the Kingsford mill,  bought the Imperial Mine, and opened the Blueberry Mine near [[Ishpeming, Michigan|Ishpeming]] to supply iron ore. The Ford Railroad was constructed between [[L'Anse, Michigan|L'Anse]] and the Cliff River for his logging operations on {{convert|300000|acre|sigfig=1|lk=on}} of timberland purchased in 1922. He often visited the Upper Peninsula on business, but as early as 1917, the year he ran for a seat in the [[U.S. Senate]], he sought entry into the Huron Mountain Club. Since the club limited its membership, Ford worked to improve his chances. His admission would ultimately come when M-35 construction was halted in the Huron Mountains.<ref name="rydholm"/>

Hunters, campers, hikers, fishermen and some landowners opposed highway construction near the Huron Mountains. Rydholm said, "...&nbsp;there seemed to be no groundswell of sentiment in favor of it, but it looked as the though the die was cast and nothing could be done to stop it".<ref name="rydholm"/> The Huron Mountain Club members opposed the highway because it would open vast reaches of the back country  and might harm the wilderness. Highway construction would also open the possibility of a resort hotel.  William C. Weber, a real estate developer from Detroit, owned property along Mountain Lake, in northern Marquette County. A [[Michigan Attorney General|Michigan attorney general]]'s opinion provided a way for blocking the road if two-thirds of the property over which the road would pass was owned by people opposed to the project. The proposed highway was to cross two {{convert|40|acre|sigfig=2|adj=on}} parcels of Huron Mountain Club property, but that was not enough to halt construction.<ref name="mayor"/>

In 1926, Hebard was elected the new president at the Huron Mountain Club<ref name="rydholm"/> and changed its rules for admission.<ref name="mayor"/> Before the changes, all existing members voted on new admissions, and four "no" votes meant rejection. After Hebard's changes, only club directors could vote, and only one "no" was needed to block election.<ref name="mayor"/> In 1927, the road grading for M-35 had reached the Salmon Trout River. That same year, Ford bought more land near Mountain Lake. This property encompassed more than the requisite two-thirds necessary to stop construction of the road. In 1928, the road was moved to connect with the Big Bay Road (CR&nbsp;550), leaving the stub of "Blind 35" behind.<ref name="rydholm"/> According to club records, "by 1929, M-35 was dead in its tracks and Henry Ford was a member".<ref name="mayor"/> To commemorate his membership, Ford built a white pine log cabin on club property that cost between $80,000 and $100,000 in 1929 (equivalent to $993,000 to $1,200,000 in 2007).<ref name="rydholm"/><ref name="CPI"> {{cite web |url= http://stats.bls.gov/cpi/ |title= CPI Inflation Calculator |accessdate=2008-02-04 |publisher= Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor }}</ref>

===After Ford===
In 1939, M-35 from Negaunee to Big Bay to L'Anse was officially canceled as a state trunkline highway.<ref name="MSHD38">{{cite map |publisher= [[Michigan Department of Transportation|Michigan State Highway Department]] |title=State of Michigan |year=[[1938-05-01]] |cartography= MSHD }}</ref><ref name="MSHD39">{{cite map |publisher= [[Michigan Department of Transportation|Michigan State Highway Department]] |title=State of Michigan |year=[[1939-07-15]] |cartography= MSHD }}</ref> Constructed portions were turned over to local control, becoming Skanee Road in Baraga County and CR&nbsp;510 in Marquette County. This left a discontinuous routing for 13&nbsp;years. The southern segment of M-35 ran from Menominee to Negaunee, and the northern segment ran from Baraga to Ontonagon along the modern [[M-38 (Michigan highway)|M-38]]. The two segments were rejoined in 1953, closing the gap left by the cancelled Huron Mountain route. M-35 signs were added to existing highway signs westward from the end of the southern segment at Negaunee along US&nbsp;41/M-28 and US&nbsp;41 to Baraga, to connect with the northern segment westward to Ontonagon.<ref name="MSHD53">{{cite map |publisher= [[Michigan Department of Transportation|Michigan State Highway Department]] |title=State of Michigan |year=[[1953-04-01]] |cartography= MSHD }}</ref>

In 1964, several abandoned underground mine shafts collapsed underneath the roadway, forcing a rerouting of M-35 out of the City of Negaunee.<ref name="ROWMC">Right of Way for the M-35 Relocation was purchased between [[1964-03-20]] and [[1964-10-12]] according to {{cite map |publisher=[[Michigan Department of Transportation]] |url=http://mdotwas1.mdot.state.mi.us/public/ROWFiles/results.cfm?Dir=Marquette |title=Right Of Way Maps for Marquette County |accessdate=2008-05-08|inset=Sheets 73<U+2013>76 }}</ref> Before the rerouting, M-35 was routed from Palmer north to Negaunee using a portion of County Road  near Lucy Hill. It also followed Silver Street connecting with part of [[M-28 Business (Ishpeming-Negaunee, Michigan)|BUS&nbsp;M-28]], a business loop of M-28,  through downtown Negaunee to US&nbsp;41 north of town. This former segment is still shown on some maps (such as [[Google Maps]]) as "Old&nbsp;M-35".<ref name="googleN">{{cite map |publisher=Google Maps |title=Negaunee, MI 49866|url= http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=Negaunee,+MI+49866&layer=&ie=UTF8&z=13&ll=46.484683,-87.582321&spn=0.074464,0.176468&om=1 |year=2007 |cartography=NAVTEQ | accessdate=2007-03-15 }}</ref> Since this rerouting, M-35 runs from Palmer past Goose Lake to end in [[Negaunee Township, Michigan|Negaunee Township]].

The last major changes to M-35 came in 1968 when the section from Baraga to Ontonagon was given the M-38 designation. The M-35 concurrencies were removed along US&nbsp;41/M-28 and US&nbsp;41 in Marquette and Baraga counties. This change shortened the highway designation and moved the northern terminus to the present location in Negaunee Township.<ref name="MDSH68">{{cite map |publisher= [[Michigan Department of Transportation|Michigan Department of State Highways]] |title=Official Highway Map |year=1968 |cartography= MDSH |section=B3<U+2013>B5 }}</ref><ref name="MDSH69">{{cite map |publisher= [[Michigan Department of Transportation|Michigan Department of State Highways]] |title=Official Highway Map |year=1969 |cartography= MDSH |section=B3<U+2013>B5 }}</ref> Since then, sections of the roadway were realigned in [[Richmond Township, Michigan|Richmond Township]] south of Palmer to straighten some of the many curves between Palmer and Gwinn on [[2 June]] [[1989]].<ref name="ROWMC2">{{cite map |publisher=[[Michigan Department of Transportation]] |url=http://mdotwas1.mdot.state.mi.us/public/ROWFiles/files/Marquette/sheet078.pdf |format=PDF|title=Right Of Way Maps for Marquette County |accessdate=2008-05-08|inset=Sheet 78 }}</ref>
