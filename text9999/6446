==History==
The ''Oregon Statesman'' was founded on March 28, 1851, by [[Asahel Bush II]], a [[Democratic Party of Oregon|Democrat]], in response to the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]]-controlled [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]]-based paper, ''[[The Oregonian]]''.<ref name="soh">{{cite web|url=http://www.salemhistory.net/commerce/statesman_journal.htm|title=Statesman Journal Newspaper|last=Mersinger|first=Monica|date=2006|work=Salem Online History|publisher=Salem Public Library|accessdate=2008-09-06}}</ref> The paper was originally based in [[Oregon City, Oregon|Oregon City]], but moved to Salem in 1853 when the [[Oregon State Capitol]] was relocated to that city.<ref name="soh"/> In March 1863, Bush sold the paper and entered the banking field.<ref name="soh"/> Will H. Parry established the ''Capital Journal'' on March 1, 1888, initially as a for-profit venture and an outlet for the [[Oregon Republican Party|Republican Party]].<ref name=SJhist>{{cite web |url=http://www.statesmanjournal.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/99999999/CUSTSERV06/50406011/-1 |title=Statesman Journal Company Profile |format= |work= |accessdate=2008-09-05}}</ref> Parry sold the ''Journal'' by the end of the year, one of many ownership changes in subsequent years.

Around 1918, [[George P. Putnam]] purchased the ''Capital Journal'' and served as editor for 30 years before selling to [[Bernard Mainwaring]] in 1953.<ref name="soh"/> Meanwhile, [[Charles A. Sprague]], who went on to become [[governor of Oregon]], bought the ''Statesman'' in 1929.<ref name="soh"/> In 1954, Mainwaring and Sprague agreed that their respective papers should cooperate closely.<ref name=SJhist/> The ''Journal'' moved into the ''Statesman'''s new facility and the two papers began sharing printing facilities while keeping independent writers and editors.<ref name="soh"/>
