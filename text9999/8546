The '''United States of Greater Austria''' ({{lang-de|Vereinigte Staaten von Gro<U+00DF>-<U+00D6>sterreich}}) was an idea created by a group of scholars surrounding the [[Austria]]n [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Archduke Franz Ferdinand]] that never came to pass. This specific proposal was conceived by [[Aurel Popovici]] in 1906.

As the twentieth century started to unfold, the greatest problem facing the dual monarchy of [[Austria-Hungary]] was that it consisted of eleven distinctly different ethnic groupings, of which only two, the [[Germans]] and [[Hungarian people|Hungarians]] (who together accounted for about 44% of the total population) wielded any power or control. The other eight groupings ([[Czech people|Czechs]], [[Polish people|Poles]], [[Ruthenians]], [[Romanians]], [[Slovaks]], [[Serbs]], [[Slovenes]] and [[Italian people|Italians]]) hardly wielded any power at all, only some Croats and Serbs had limited autonomy in the [[Kingdom of Croatia and Slavonia]]. The idea of the Dual Monarchy system of 1867 had been to split the previous [[Austrian Empire]] into two realms, one German-dominated, the other Hungarian-dominated. However, after various demonstrations, uprisings and acts of [[terrorism]], it became readily apparent that the notion of two ethnic groups dominating the other nine could not realistically survive ''in perpetuam''.

Franz Ferdinand had planned to radically redraw the map of Austria-Hungary, creating a number of ethnically and linguistically dominated semi-autonomous "states" which would all be part of a larger confederation renamed the United States of Greater Austria. Under this plan, language and cultural identification was encouraged, and the disproportionate balance of power would be corrected. The idea was set to encounter heavy opposition from the Hungarian part of the Dual Monarchy, since a direct result of the reform would have been a significant territorial loss for Hungary.

However, the Archduke was assassinated at [[Sarajevo]] in 1914, triggering the outbreak of the [[World War I|First World War]], after which Austria-Hungary was dismantled and several new nation states were created, as well as various Austro-Hungarian territories ceded to existing neighbouring countries, by the victorious [[Triple Entente|Entente]] powers.

==Proposed states from Aurel Popovici==

The idea came from Hungarian revolutionary [[Lajos Kossuth]], who proposed to transform the Habsburg Empire into a so-called "Danubian State", a federal state with autonomous regions.{{Fact|date=March 2009}} The following territories were supposed to become states of the federation after the reform. The majority ethnic group within each territory is also listed.
