'''Horne''' is a rural village and [[civil parishes in England|civil parish]] in the [[Tandridge (district)|District of Tandridge]] in [[Surrey]], [[England]].  The parish includes the hamlet of [[Newchapel, Surrey|Newchapel]] and is home to the '''British Wildlife Centre'''.  Eastern fields forming a narrow part of the parish are split by the [[A22 road]], a main road to [[East Grinstead]].  

The civil parish covers {{convert|1419|ha}} and is centred {{convert|4.6|mi|km}} east of [[Horley]], {{convert|4.2|mi|km}} west of [[Lingfield, Surrey|Lingfield]], {{convert|8.0|mi|km}} [[boxing the compass|SSW]] of [[Oxted]], and {{convert|22.0|mi|km}} south-east of [[Kingston upon Thames]].

==History==
A British ([[Celtic Britain|Celtic]]) gold coin has been found in Horne, but is more probably a mark of transit than of settlement. Otherwise there are no prehistoric remains, such as are usually found in other [[the Weald|Wealden]] parishes. Horne must have owed such importance as it had later to the [[iron smelting|iron industry]].<ref name=m/>

The parish lay within the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] [[Tandridge (hundred)|Tandridge]] [[hundred (division)|hundred]], where the wealthy and powerful would meet periodically at a level below that of the [[shires of England|shire]] to decide on strategic matters, and later for settling disputes in the [[Hundred Court]]. The earliest reference to Horne by name was in the 12th Century.  Horne had a [[chapelry]] and [[manor]] but did not become a parish until 1705, from the southernmost part of [[Bletchingley]] (parish).<ref name=m/> 

Mr. Stileman, who was instituted parson in 1728, bought a house near the church, but this was afterwards bought by the parish for a workhouse, and so continued to be used until the [[Poor Law Amendment Act 1834]].  Horne [[common land|Common]] was [[inclosure|inclosed]] by an Act of 1810 and an order made on 14 April 1813.  [[Jesus College, Cambridge]] parted with Horne Court Manor in 1891 to allow a parsonage house to be built instead.<ref name=m/>

In 1953 parish boundaries were changed with the southern part of Horne gaining its own civil parish council, [[Felbridge]], whilst to compensate for this parts of [[Godstone]] and [[Tandridge, Surrey|Tandridge]] were added.  Although the electoral division at County Hall is named ''Lingfield'', which is well-known throughout the region for its [[Lingfield Racecourse|horse-racing course]], that neighbouring parish has no other historic connection to the village, nor the others within its division.<ref name=m/>

==Landmarks==
===Airfield and barrage balloon site===
A temporary airfield was established to support the [[Normandy]] Landings in early 1944 on farmland straddling Bones Lane. It was constructed in three months and used for just seven weeks from May to June 1944. Thereafter it served as an anti-[[V-1 (flying bomb)|V-1 rocket]] balloon site for a month and was returned to farmland in 1945.<ref>[http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/unit_page.jsp?u_id=10052221 A Vision of Britain through time] [[University of Portsmouth]] and others</ref>

===Church===
The [[Victorian restoration|heavily-restored]] church in the heart of the village, dedicated to St Mary the Virgin, has 14th and 15th century windows.  The south door dates from 1250, and there is a 14th century oak screen and 15th century chancel beams. Considerable restoration was undertaken in 1880.<ref>{{cite web|title=St Mary the Virgin, Horne|url=http://www.achurchnearyou.com/horne-st-mary-the-virgin/|work=A Church Near You|publisher=Church of England|accessdate=3 October 2011}}</ref>, which robbed the building of almost all its archaeological interest and completely destroyed its early history.

The oldest feature now remaining is the south doorway, which dates from the middle of the 13th century, but this may possibly have been inserted in the walls of a 12th-century nave. A slight inclination of the chancel to the north shows rebuilding of the east end of the church, but here again the absence of any original detail earlier than a 15th-century rood stair in the west end of the south wall makes the dating of this rebuilding, if indeed it ever took place, a matter of conjecture.<ref name=m>{{cite web |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=43067 |title=Parishes: Horne |author=H.E.

===British Wildlife Centre===
The British Wildlife Centre lies in the east of the parish, and has a collection of over 40 species of wildlife.  The centre, developed on the site of a former dairy farm, opened in 1997, and participates in [[captive breeding|captive breeding programmes]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Animals at the British Wildlife Centre|url=http://www.britishwildlifecentre.co.uk/index.htm|publisher=British Wildlife Centre|accessdate=3 October 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Story of the Centre|url=http://www.britishwildlifecentre.co.uk/index.htm|publisher=British Wildlife Centre|accessdate=3 October 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Conservation Objectives|url=http://www.britishwildlifecentre.co.uk/conservation/conservationframeset.htm|publisher=British Wildlife Centre|accessdate=3 October 2011}}</ref>

==Geography==
The parish is except for its far north, yielding sedimentary [[ironstone]], is on the [[The Weald|Wealden Clay]]<ref name=m/> and was until the 16th century forested, rather than interspersed with six woodlands as it is today.  Hornecourt Wood by the northern border is a [[Site of Special Scientific Interest]].   At the opposite end of the parish, Home Wood also occupies approximately 5% of the land. Elevations vary from 115m to 48m above sea level and the parish has several sources of the [[River Eden, Kent]].<ref name=os>[http://getamap.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/getamap/frames.htm?mapAction=gaz&gazName=g&gazString=TQ3344 Grid square map] [[Ordnance survey]] website</ref>

==Demography==
The proportion of households in Horne who owned their home outright was within 4% of the borough and regional average.  The proportion who owned their home with a loan was 8% greater than the regional average; providing overall a lower proportion than average of rented residential property and of [[social housing]], and close to the average in [[Surrey]].<ref name=ons/>

==Local government==
The [[United Kingdom Census 2011]] considered the parish which is within the [[wards of the United Kingdom|ward]] ''Burstow, Horne and Outwood'', containing three of the four villages of the south-west of Tandridge.  The parish borders the extreme south of the two central parishes, [[Godstone, Surrey|Godstone]] and [[Limpsfield]].   At [[Surrey County Council]], one of 81 councillors represents the area who sits at Kingston for a division simplistically named '''Lingfield'''.<ref>[http://mycouncil.surreycc.gov.uk/mgWardMap.aspx? Division Map] [[Surrey County Council]]</ref>

==Transport==
The civil parish has no motorways or railways.  It is centred {{convert|4.6|mi|km}} east of [[Horley]], {{convert|4.2|mi|km}} west of [[Lingfield, Surrey|Lingfield]], {{convert|8.0|mi|km}} [[boxing the compass|SSW]] of [[Oxted]], and {{convert|22.0|mi|km}} south-east of [[Kingston upon Thames]].

Eastern fields are split by the [[A22 road]], a main road to [[East Grinstead]],{{#tag:ref|Shown green on the map.|group= n}} which also is used by those closest to the route as opposed to the [[M23 motorway|M23]] and [[A27 road (Great Britain)|main coastal route]] to access [[Eastbourne]], a large coastal town and the route is a main one for a small portion of [[East Sussex]].
