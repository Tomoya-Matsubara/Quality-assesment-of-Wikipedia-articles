'''The Lucy Stone League''' is a [[women<U+2019>s rights]] organization founded in 1921.<ref>Stannard, Una.  (1977).  ''Mrs Man''.  Germainbooks.  ISBN 0-914142-02-X.</ref> Its motto is "A wife should no more take her husband's name than he should hers. My name is my identity and must not be lost".<ref name=LSL>http://lucystoneleague.org The League's official website, which uses [[retro]]-style graphics.

It was among the first [[feminist]] groups to arise from the [[Women's suffrage in the United States|suffrage movement]], and gained attention for seeking and preserving women's own-name rights, such as the particular ones which follow in this article.

The group took its name from [[Lucy Stone]] (1818&ndash;1893), the first woman in the [[United States]] to carry her ''birth name'' through life, despite her marriage in 1855. The ''New York Times'' called the group the "Maiden Namers".  The group held its first meetings, debates and functions at the [[Hotel Pennsylvania]] in New York City, including its founding meeting on 17 May 1921.<ref>Stannard 1977, pp. 191-192.</ref>

The founder of the Lucy Stone League was [[Ruth Hale (feminist)|Ruth Hale]], a New York City [[journalist]] and [[critic]]. The wife of ''New York World'' columnist [[Heywood Broun]], Ruth Hale challenged in federal court any government edict that would not recognize a married woman, such as herself, by the name she chose to use.<ref name=Ch15 />  The only one in her household called Mrs Heywood Broun was the cat.<ref>Stannard 1977, pp. 180-181.</ref>

The League became so well known that a new phrase '''Lucy Stoner''' came into common use, for anyone who advocates that a wife be allowed to keep and use her own name, which eventually got into the dictionaries.<ref name="Stannard 1977, p. 193">Stannard 1977, p. 193.</ref>

Some of the members often attended the [[Algonquin Round Table]].<ref>Stannard 1977, p. 181.</ref>  Since many League members wrote for a living, they could and did write frequently about the group in New York City newspapers.<ref name="Stannard 1977, p. 193"/>

There were many well-known women who were ''Lucy Stoners'' and kept their names after marriage but were ''not'' known to be League members, such as (listed alphabetically) [[Isadora Duncan]] (dancer), [[Amelia Earhart]] (aviation celebrity), [[Margaret Mead]] (anthropologist), [[Edna St. Vincent Millay]] (poet), [[Georgia O'Keeffe]] (artist), [[Frances Perkins]] (first woman appointed to any U.S. cabinet), and [[Michael Strange]] (poet, playwright, actress) <U+2013> aka [[Blanche Oelrichs]] <U+2013> aka the wife of actor [[John Barrymore]].<ref>Stannard 1977: p. 197 for Duncan, then Earhart p. 215, Mead p. 199, Millay pp. 197-198, O'Keefe p. 198, Perkins p. 189, Sanger p. 197, and Strange pp. 192-193.</ref>

==First historical period==
The founding of the League was presented above, in the introduction.

Ruth Hale's first battle (begun in 1920) with the government was to get a [[passport]] issued to her by the [[U.S. State Department]] in her own name <U+2013> just as for any man.<ref>Stannard 1977, pp. 190=91 and 204-208.</ref>  Victory was attained five years later in 1925, by the League, when the first married woman in the United States to receive a passport in her own name was [[Doris Fleischman]],<ref>Stannard 1977, p. 208.</ref> the wife of [[Edward L. Bernays]].<ref>Stannard 1977, p. 196.</ref>

An earlier victory for the group came in May 1921 when Hale got a [[real estate]] deed issued in her birth name rather than Mrs. Heywood Broun.<ref>Stannard 1977, p. 191.  For other property deeds, see p. 199.</ref> When the time came to transfer the title of the [[Upper West Side]] apartment building, Hale refused to go on record as Mrs. Heywood Broun; the papers were changed to Ruth Hale.

The League pioneered and fought for other married women's rights, in the 1920s U.S., to do each of the following in their own names: to register at a hotel,<ref name="Stannard 1977, p. 191">Stannard 1977, p. 191.</ref> to have bank accounts and sign checks,<ref name="Stannard 1977, p. 191"/> to have a telephone account or a store account or an insurance policy or a library card,<ref>Stannard 1977, p. 199.</ref> to register (to vote) and to vote,<ref>Stannard 1977, pp. 199-200.</ref> to get a copyright,<ref>Stannard 1977, pp. 211-12.</ref> and to receive paychecks.<ref>Stannard 1977, pp. 201-04.  Also see p. 239.</ref>  These rights may be taken for granted today, but the legal right of a married woman in the U.S. to use her own name (rather than her husband's name) was denied by many officials and courts until an 9 Oct 1972 court decision,<ref>Stannard 1977, p. 278.</ref> as documented in the 1977 book [[Mrs Man]], by [[Una Stannard]].<ref>Stannard 1977, p. 238 and all of Ch. 17, ''Fiat Lex'', pp. 239-261.</ref>

In its first incarnation the League was short lived.  The group's lawyer, [[Rose Bres]], died in 1927; by 1931 Ruth Hale,  who believed that a woman is "through after forty", became depressed and then died in 1934.  By the early 1930s the Lucy Stone League was inactive.<ref>Stannard 1977, p. 218.</ref>

==Second historical period==
The League was restarted in 1950 by [[Jane Grant]], plus twenty two former members, its first meeting being on 22 Mar 1950 in New York City.  Grant promptly won the [[Census Bureau]]'s agreement that a married woman could use her maiden [[surname]] as her official or real name in the census. (''The New York Times'', 10 Apr 1950).<ref>Stannard 1977, p. 262.</ref>

But the "legal stone wall" that U.S. women ran into with many officials and even in the courts persisted until the [[U.S. Congress]] passed the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] on 22 Mar 1972 (never ratified by the U.S.).<ref>Stannard 1977, pp. 272-77.</ref>  This 1972 event, plus the researching of and documentation of past legal cases by women lawyers, led to the above-mentioned 9 Oct 1972 court decision.<ref>Stannard 1977, pp. 277-78.</ref>

So in the 1950s and 1960s period, prior to 1972, the "new" League had to change its approach <U+2013> it widened its focus to include all discrimination against women in the U.S.; the League became a [[proto]] <U+2013> [[National Organization for Women]] (''NOW'').<ref>Stannard 1977, p. 263.</ref>

The reborn League operated as a non-political and non-partisan center of research and information on the status of women. It sponsored college scholarships and set up feminist libraries in high schools.  It worked for [[gender equality]] in legal, economic, educational, and social relationships.<ref>Stannard 1977, pp. 262-65.</ref><ref name=history>http://lucystoneleague.org/history.html The League's official history. To access it from the League's homepage: First click on the tab "Who are we?", and then on ''its'' button "LSL History".</ref>

As of the early 1990s the Lucy Stone League "still gave nursing scholarships and hosted a combination annual meeting and strawberry festival" <U+2013> though the ''gender equality'' issues listed in the previous paragraph had been largely taken over by ''NOW'' (since 1966) and other women's groups.<ref name=history /><ref>Parker, Mary Lou or ML (1994).  ''Fashioning feminism: the making of the Lucy Stone League by members and media'', 602 pp.  University of Oregon.  p. 58.</ref>

==Third historical period==
A modern version of the League was started in 1997, as follows:  By 1997 the activities of the League had ceased and a report was published that "Alas, the League is no more."<ref>[[Justin Kaplan]] & [[Anne Bernays]], (7 Feb 1997).  ''The Language of Names''.  Simon & Schuster.  ISBN 0-684-80741-6 p. 158.</ref>  When he read this report, [[Morrison Bonpasse]], a past president of the League, was "inspired" to restart the League, at the same time shifting the focus back to name equality <U+2013> which was/is not addressed by ''NOW''.  This restart eventually became "the re-launching of the website (lucystoneleague.org) under the direction of a new board and its current president Ms. [[Cristina Lucia Stasia]]".<ref name=history />

In addition, there is a group of women in New York who are still active under the name "Lucy Stone League" and this group has been a dues paying affiliate of the [[International Alliance of Women]],<ref>http://www.womenalliance.org International Alliance of Women.</ref> for decades. It hosted the IAW Triennial Congress in New York City in 1999.<ref>IAW, Centenary 1904-2004 Website (2004). http://www.womenalliance.org/pdf/IAWCentenaryEdition19042004webversion.pdf, "IAW Centenary Edition," a pdf file: pp. 85 and 108, available online.
