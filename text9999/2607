'''''Procaris hawaiana''''' is a species of [[shrimp]] in the family [[Procarididae]], from [[Maui]], Hawaii.<ref name="LB">Holthuis, L. B. 1973. Caridean shrimps found in land-locked saltwater pools at four Indo-West Pacific localities (Sinai Peninsula, Funafuti Atoll, Maui and Hawaii Islands), with the description of one new genus and four new species. Zoologische Verhandelingen , Leiden 128.</ref> The species is very similar to ''[[Procaris ascensionis]]'' from [[Ascension Island]]. In ''P. ascensionis'' the [[integument]] is less firm, the [[rostrum]]] is shorter, the [[cervical]] groove is more distinct, and the third abdominal [[somite]] reaches less far posteriorly over the fourth; also the [[scaphocerite]] has the final tooth still less distinct than in ''P. hawaiana'', and the last segment of its [[Antenna (biology)|antenna]]l [[wikt:peduncle|peduncle]] is less slender.

==Description==
The rostrum is short and pointed, it reaches just beyond the eyes. In lateral view it is slender, and tapers regularly towards the tip. In dorsal view it is elongate triangular and its lateral margins merge gradually with the orbital margin. The [[carapace]] bears no spines or [[carinae]], only a narrow and shallow cervical groove is visible, which does not reach the [[dorsum]]. The abdominal somites are smooth. The first has the [[pleura]] large and 
rounded. The pleura of the second overlap both those of the first and third. The third somite is noticeable in that the posteromedian part is hood-like prolonged posteriorly and reaches beyond the middle of the fourth somite. The fourth somite has the pleura rounded, those of the fifth end in a bluntly rounded top. The sixth somite is approximately 1.5 times as long as the fifth, both its pleura and posterolateral angles are rounded.

The [[telson]] is distinctly longer than the sixth abdominal somite. It is elongate triangular and has two pairs of dorsal spines. The posterior margin of the telson is broadly trianguiar with a blunt top. It bears 4 pairs of spines. Its eyes are broad and have at the inner half of their anterior margin a conical process which is directed forwards and upward and reaches beyond the eye itself. The rest of the eye is broadly and bluntly triangular in dorsal 
view and bears an irregular pigment spot. Like in ''P. ascensionis'', no distinct [[cornea]]l elements are visible. The [[antennula]] has a large pointed [[stylocerite]], which reaches about to the end of the second segment of the antennular peduncle. Two simple antennular flagella are present, both being very long. The scaphocerite is twice as long as wide.

The [[mandible]] consists of a single [[molar]] process, which is pointed and has a cutting edge which is dark coloured and shows a few small teeth; there is a distinct three-segmented [[wikt:palpus|palp]]. The [[maxilla]] has two [[endite]]s, the lower is oval to quadrangular, the upper is truncate and has the distal margin with strong spines; there is a single undivided palp. The three [[maxilliped]]s all have a well developed [[exopod]] with a multi-articulated flagellum. The [[epipod]] is oval. The [[dactylus]] is elongate and is attached with one 
of its longer sides to the [[propodus]]. Its [[carpus]] is short and the [[merus]] more than twice as long as the carpus. The merus is somewhat shorter than the carpus and 3/5 of the length of the [[ischium]]. The latter is wider than any of the other segments and its posterodistal end reaches beyond the base of the merus. None of the legs shows a [[chela]]. The ischium bears a large movable spine.

The carapace lengths of ranges between {{convert|4|and|8|mm|in}}, the total length between about {{convert|10|and|30|mm|in}}. Dr . Maciolek (1972) described the species as the [[exoskeleton]] having a slight red pigmentation, particularly along the midline; with some black pigment associated with its eyes.<ref name="Maciolek" /> The species is a pale, slightly purplish pink shrimp with the carapace yellow or whitish by the presence of its internal organs shining through. The carapace has a darker red spot behind the rostrum, and a less distinct one near the middle of the posterior margin. The abdomen is pink with a transverse orange-red band over the first [[tergite]], and a narrow median longitudinal streak on the fourth somite. On its [[tailfan]] there are several red spots. The lower surface of the body is uniformly pink, the thorax being brighter than that of the abdomen. The appendages are pale pink or colourless. Other specimens have shown different colouor patterns.<ref name="LB" />

==Distribution==
''Procaris hawaiana'' has been seen in [[Cape Kinau]], and [[Hawaii Island]], in small [[anchialine pool]]s, cohabitating with [[Calliasmata]] species.

==Behaviour==
According to Dr . Maciolek (1972)<ref name="Maciolek">Maciolek, John A., and Richard E. Brock. Aquatic survey of the Kona coast ponds, Hawaii Island. Vol. 74. No. 4. University of Hawaii Sea Grant Program, 1974.</ref>: The animal swims with its legs extended fan-like and symmetrically in a plane below the body. Usually it does so close to the [[Substrate (biology)|substrate]] (lava), occasionally in [[midwater]], and sometimes along the underside of the surface film.
