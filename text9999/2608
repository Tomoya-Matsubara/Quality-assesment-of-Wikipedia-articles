{{otheruses4|the battleship|other uses of the term|Yamato}}

'''''Yamato''''' (<U+5927><U+548C>), named after the ancient Japanese [[Yamato Province]], was a [[battleship]] of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] during [[World War II]], and flagship of the [[Japanese Combined Fleet]]. She was  [[lead ship]] of [[Yamato class battleship|her class]]. She and her sister ship, [[Japanese battleship Musashi|''Musashi'']] were the largest and heaviest battleships ever constructed, displacing 72,800&nbsp;tonnes at full load, and armed with nine 46&nbsp;cm (18.1&nbsp;inch) main guns.

Constructed from 1937&ndash;1940 and formally commissioned in late 1941, ''Yamato'' served as the flagship of Admiral [[Isoroku Yamamoto]] throughout 1942, first sailing as part of the Combined Fleet during the [[Battle of Midway]] in June 1942.  Throughout 1943, ''Yamato'' continually transferred between [[Truk]], [[Kure]] and [[Brunei]] in response to American airstrikes on Japanese island bases.  ''Yamato'' first fired her main guns at enemy targets in October 1944, during the [[Battle off Samar]].  ''Yamato'' was sunk in April 1945 during [[Operation Ten-Go]].

==Design and Construction==
{{main|Yamato class battleship}}

[[Image:Yamato battleship under construction.jpg|left|thumb|''Yamato'' under construction]]
''Yamato'' was the lead ship of [[Yamato class battleship|her class]] of "heavy-battleships",<ref>Schom (2004), p. 43</ref> designed by the Imperial Japanese Navy in 1937.<ref name=cfrecord>{{Cite web |url= http://combinedfleet.com/yamato.htm|title= Combined Fleet - tabular history of ''Yamato''|accessdate=8 January 2009 |work= |publisher=Parshall, Jon; Bob Hackett, Sander Kingsepp, & Allyn Nevitt |date=}}</ref>  The class of battleship was designed to be capable of engaging multiple enemy targets, as a method of compensating for Japan's incapability to industrially compete with the [[United States Navy]].<ref name=johnston122>Johnston and McAuley (2000), p. 122</ref><ref>Willmott (2000), p. 35; the Japanese Empire produced 3.5% of the world's industrial output, while the United States produced 35%</ref>  With the vessels of the ''Yamato'' class displacing over 70,000 tons each, it was hoped that the firepower of the constructed battleships could offset American industrial power.<ref name=jackson74/>

The keel of ''Yamato'' was laid down at [[Kure Naval Arsenal]] on 4 November 1937, in a specially designed dockyard.  Throughout construction, large canvases prevented observation of the construction from elsewhere in the Kure Dockyards.<ref name=johnston123/>  Due to the size of the vessel, upgraded gantry cranes&mdash;each capable of lifting 150 and 350 tonnes&mdash;had to be designed and built for use during construction.<ref name=johnston123>Johnston and McAuley (2000), p. 123</ref>  ''Yamato'' was launched 8 August 1940, with Captain (later Vice Admiral) [[Miyazato Shutoku]] in command.<ref name=cfrecord/>

===Armament===
''Yamato's'' main battery consisted of nine 18.1&nbsp;inch [[40 cm/45 Type 94]] naval guns&mdash;the largest caliber of naval artillery ever fitted to a warship.<ref name=jackson75>Jackson (2000), p. 75</ref> Each gun was {{convert|21.13|m|ft}} long, weighed {{convert|147.3|MT|ST}}, and was capable of firing high-explosive or armour-piercing shells {{convert|42.0|km|mi}}.<ref>Johnston and McAuley (2000), p. 123 - each of the three main turrets weighed more than an good-sized destroyer.</ref>  Her secondary battery comprised twelve {{convert|6.1|in|cm|adj=on}} guns mounted in four triple turrets (one forward, one aft, two midships),<ref name=jackson75/> and twelve {{convert|5|in|cm|adj=on}} guns in six double-turrets (three on each side amidships).<ref name=jackson75/> In addition, ''Yamato'' carried twenty-four {{convert|1|in|cm|adj=on}} anti-aircraft guns, primarily mounted amidships.<ref name=jackson75/>  When refitted in 1944, the secondary battery configuration was changed to six {{convert|6.1|in|cm|adj=on}} guns,<ref name=johnston180>Johnston and McAuley (2000), p. 180</ref> twenty-four {{convert|5|in|cm|adj=on}} guns,<ref name=johnston180/> and one hundred and sixty-two {{convert|1|in|cm|adj=on}} antiaircraft guns,<ref name=johnston180/> in preparation for naval engagements in the South Pacific.<ref name="jackson128">Jackson (2000), p. 128</ref>

==Combat Service==
===1942: Trials and Initial Operations===
On 16 December 1941, ''Yamato'' was officially commissioned at Kure, with Captain (later Vice Admiral) [[Takayanagi Gihachi]] in overall command of the ship; she joined fellow battleships [[Japanese battleship Nagato|''Nagato'']] and [[Japanese battleship Mutsu|''Mutsu'']] in the 1st Battleship Division on the same day.<ref name=cfrecord/>  On 12 February 1942, ''Yamato'' became the flagship of Admiral [[Isoroku Yamamoto]]'s [[Japanese Combined Fleet|Combined Fleet]].<ref name=cfrecord/>  Following extensive [[sea trial]]s and war-games, ''Yamato'' was deemed fully operational and serviceable on 27 May 1942, and was assigned to Yamamoto's Main Battleship force for the upcoming [[Battle of Midway]].<ref name=ballard36>Ballard (1999), p. 36</ref>  During the pivotal battle, Yamamoto exercised overall command of the Japanese assault force from ''Yamato's'' bridge.<ref name=ballard36/>  Following the disastrous defeat of Japan's primary carrier force (four fleet carriers and 332 aircraft destroyed), ''Yamato'' and the main battleship force withdrew to [[Hashirajima]].<ref name=cfrecord/>

On 17 August 1942, ''Yamato'' departed Kure for [[Truk]].  Eleven days later, the submarine [[USS Flying Fish (SS-229)|''USS Flying Fish'']] spotted ''Yamato'', firing four torpedoes at the battleship.  No hits were scored, and ''Yamato'' entered Truk later in the day.  Throughout the [[Guadalcanal Campaign|American naval campaign at Guadalcanal]], ''Yamato'' remained at Truk, as her high fuel consumption rates prevented feasible use in the Solomon Islands Campaign.<ref name="jackson128"/>  In December 1942, Captain (later Rear-Admiral) [[Matsuda Chiaki]] was assigned to command of ''Yamato''.<ref name=cfrecord/><!-- The "Fast Carriers" book I borrowed (see [[Yamato class battleship]] for full citation) names him as Chiaki Matsuda...(page 158) -->

===1943: Movement between bases===
On 11 February 1943, ''Musashi'' replaced ''Yamato'' as flagship of the Combined Fleet.<ref name=cfrecord/>  ''Yamato'' remained at Truk until May 1943, when it departed first for Yokosuka, and then for Kure.  For nine days, ''Yamato'' was drydocked for both inspection and general repairs.  ''Yamato'' was again drydocked in July, with her antiaircraft suite, secondary-turret armour, and rudder controls undergoing significant refitting and upgrades.<ref name=cfrecord/>  In August, ''Yamato'' returned to Truk, joining a large Japanese Task Force in response to American raids on Tarawa and Makin atolls.<ref name=cfrecord/>  In November 1943, ''Yamato'' joined a larger task-force&mdash;six battleships, three carriers, and eleven cruisers&mdash;in response to American airstrikes on Wake Island.  On both occasions, no contact was made with American forces, and the fleet retired to Truk.<ref name=cfrecord/>

On 23 December, while transporting troops and equipment to the [[Admiralty Islands]], ''Yamato'' and her taskgroup were intercepted by the submarine {{USS|Skate|SS-305|6}}.  ''Skate'' fired a spread of four torpedoes at ''Yamato'', with two striking on the starboard side near Turret #3.<ref name=cfrecord/>  Severe failure of the armoured belt flooded the upper magazine of the rear turret, and ''Yamato'' was forced to retire to Truk for emergency repairs.<ref name=cfrecord/>

===1944: Combat===
[[Image:Yamato1945.png|thumb|right|Line Drawing of ''Yamato'' as she appeared in 1944&ndash;1945.]]

On 16 January 1944, ''Yamato'' arrived at Kure for repairs, and was drydocked until 3 February 1944.  While drydocked, Captain [[Morishita Nobuei]]&mdash;former Captain of the battleship [[Japanese battleship Haruna|''Haruna'']]&mdash;assumed command of ''Yamato''.<ref name=cfrecord/>  On 25 February, both ''Yamato'' and ''Musashi'' were reassigned from the 1st Battleship Division to the Second Fleet.  ''Yamato'' was again drydocked for extensive upgrading of radar and antiaircraft systems throughout March 1944,<ref name=cfrecord/> with a final AA suite of one hundred sixty-two 1-inch (25&nbsp;mm) antiaircraft guns and twenty-four 5-inch (13&nbsp;cm) medium guns.<ref name=johnston180/>  The radar suite was also upgraded to include infrared identification systems, aircraft-search and gunnery-control radar systems.<ref name=cfrecord/>  Following a short transport mission to the South Pacific in April, ''Yamato'' departed for [[Lingga]] alongside [[Jisaburo Ozawa]]'s Mobile Fleet.<ref name=cfrecord/>

From 19&ndash;23 June 1944, ''Yamato'' escorted forces of Ozawa's Mobile Fleet during the [[Battle of the Philippine Sea]], dubbed by American pilots as "The Great Marianas Turkey Shoot".<ref>Reynolds (1982), p. 139</ref>  Japanese aircraft losses exceeded 400, while three aircraft carriers were lost to submarines and airstrikes.<ref>Reynolds (1982), p. 142</ref>  ''Yamato's'' only major engagement throughout the operation was the accidental opening fire of ''Yamato's'' main guns on returning Japanese aircraft.<ref name=cfrecord/>  Following the battle, ''Yamato'' and the Mobile Fleet withdrew to [[Brunei]] to refuel and rearm.<ref name=cfrecord/>

[[Image:Yamato hit by bomb.jpg|thumb|left|[[Battle of the Sibuyan Sea]], 24 October 1944. ''Yamato'' is hit by a bomb near her forward 460&nbsp;mm gun turret during attacks by American carrier aircraft]]

From 22&ndash;25 October 1944, ''Yamato'' joined Admiral [[Takeo Kurita]]'s Centre force in the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]], the largest naval engagement in history.<ref>Reynolds (1982), p. 152</ref>  During the [[Battle of the Sibuyan Sea]], ''Yamato'' was hit with three armour-piercing bombs from aircraft of the {{USS|Essex|CV-9|6}}, while her sister-ship ''Musashi''&mdash;having been hit with seventeen torpedoes and nineteen bombs&mdash;sank, forcing Kurita to transfer his flag to ''Yamato''.<ref name=cfrecord/>  On the evening of 24 October, Kurita's Centre Force navigated the San Bernardino Strait, attacking a small force of escort carriers and destroyers shortly after dawn.<ref name=R156>Reynolds (1982), p. 156</ref> In the initial stages of the [[Battle off Samar]], ''Yamato'' engaged enemy surface forces for the first time, confirming hits on an escort carrier, a destroyer, and a destroyer escort.<ref name=R156/> When a spread of American torpedoes trailed towards ''Yamato'', the battleship was forced to withdraw from the battle.<ref name=cfrecord/>

Following the engagement off Samar, ''Yamato'' and the remainder of Force A returned to Brunei.<ref>Steinberg (1980), p. 63</ref>  On 15 November 1944, the 1st Battleship Division was disbanded, and ''Yamato'' became the flagship of the Second Fleet.<ref name=cfrecord/>  On 21 November, while withdrawing to Kure, ''Yamato''{{'}}s battlegroup was attacked by the submarine {{USS|Sealion|SS-315|6}}, with the battleship [[Japanese battleship Kongo|''Kongo'']] and several destroyers lost.<ref>Jackson (2000), p. 129</ref>  Upon returning to Kure, ''Yamato'' was immediately drydocked for repairs and antiaircraft upgrades, with several older antiaircraft guns being replaced.  On 25 November, Captain [[Aruga Kosaku]] was named commander of ''Yamato''.<ref name=cfrecord/>

===1945: Final Operations and Sinking===
On 1 January 1945, ''Yamato'', ''Haruna'' and ''Nagato'' were all transferred to the newly reactivated 1st Battleship Division; ''Yamato'' left drydock two days later.<ref name=cfrecord/>  When the 1st Battleship Division was deactivated once again on 10 February, ''Yamato'' was reassigned to the 1st Carrier Division.  On 19 March 1945, while docked at the major naval base of Kure, ''Yamato'' came under heavy attack when American carrier aircraft from {{USS|Enterprise|CV-6|2}}, {{USS|Yorktown|CV-10|2}} and {{USS|Intrepid|CV-11|2}} raided Kure.<ref name=R160>Reynolds (1982), p. 160</ref><ref name="Fast Carriers 338">Reynolds (1968), p. 338</ref>  Damage to the battleship, however, was light,<ref name=R160/> due in part to a stalwart defense of the base by elite Japanese fighter pilots flying [[Kawanishi N1K]] "George" fighters; these fighters were led by the famed [[Minoru Genda]], who planned the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]].<ref name=cfrecord/><ref name="Fast Carriers 338"/>  On 29 March, ''Yamato'' took on a full stock of ammunition, in preparation for combat off Okinawa in [[Operation Ten-Go]].<ref name=cfrecord/>

[[File:Yamato battleship explosion.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Magazine (artillery)|magazine]]s of the sinking ''Yamato'' explode]]

Operation Ten-Go was a deliberate suicide attack against American forces off [[Okinawa]] by ''Yamato'' and nine escorts, beginning on 6 April 1945.  Embarking from Kure, ''Yamato'' was to beach herself near Okinawa, and act as an unsinkable gun-emplacement&mdash;bombarding American forces on Okinawa with her formidable 18.1&nbsp;inch heavy-guns.<ref name=R166>Reynolds (1982), p. 166</ref>  ''Yamato'' carried only enough fuel to reach Okinawa, as the fuel stocks available were insufficient to provide enough fuel to reach Okinawa and return.<ref name=R166/>  While navigating the Bungo Strait, ''Yamato'' and her escorts were spotted by the American submarines {{USS|Threadfin|SS-410|2}} and {{USS|Hackleback|SS-295|2}}, both of which notified [[Task Force 58]] of ''Yamato's'' position.<ref name=cfrecord/><ref name="jackson128"/>

At 12:32 on 7 April 1945, ''Yamato'' was attacked by a first wave of 280 aircraft from Task Force 58, taking three hits (two bombs, one torpedo).<ref name=cfrecord/>  By 14:00, two of ''Yamato's'' escorts had been sunk.<ref name="jackson128"/>  Shortly afterwards, a second strike of 100 aircraft attacked ''Yamato'' and her remaining escorts.  At 14:23, having taken 10 torpedo and 7 bomb hits, ''Yamato's'' forward ammunition magazines detonated.<ref name="jackson128"/>  The explosion&mdash;over four miles high&mdash;was seen {{convert|100|mi|km}} away on [[Kyushu]].<ref>Reynolds (1982), p. 169</ref>  2,498 of the 2,700 crew members on ''Yamato'' were lost, including Admiral [[Seiichi It<U+014D>]].<ref name=cfrecord/>
