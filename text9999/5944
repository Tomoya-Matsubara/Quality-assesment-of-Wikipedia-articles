The '''Russian famine of 1891-2''' began along the [[Volga River]], then spread as far as the [[Ural Mountains|Urals]] and [[Black Sea]]. The reawakening of Russian [[w:Marxism|Marxism]] and [[w:populism|populism]] is often traced to the public's anger at the [[Tsarist]] government's handling of the disaster.

== Weather ==
In 1891 a particularly dry autumn had delayed the planting of the fields. That winter temperatures fell to -31 degrees Celsius, but very little snow fell therefore the seedlings were totally unprotected from the frost. When the [[Volga]] river flooded the lack of snow caused the water to freeze, killing more seedlings as well as the [[fodder]] used to feed the horses. Those seelings that weren't killed by frost were blown away along with the [[topsoil]] in an uncommonly windy spring. The summer started as early as April and proved to be a long dry one. The city of [[Orenburg]] for example had no rain for over 100 days. Forests, horses, crops and peasants all began to die, and by the end of 1892 about half a million people were dead, mostly from [[cholera]] epidemics triggered by the famine.

== Other causes ==
Weather alone cannot be blamed as there was enough grain in Russia to feed the starving areas{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}. The peasants used medieval technology like wooden ploughs and sickles. They rarely had modern fertilizers or machinery (the [[Petrovsky]] academy in Moscow was Russia's only [[agricultural school]]). Russia's primitive railways were not up to redistributing grain. The affected area was a stronghold of communal land distribution so that households had no incentive to improve the land or mechanize, but every incentive to produce as many children as possible (Russia had Europe's highest birth rate{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}). 
The main blame was laid at the government, which was discredited by the famine. It refused to use that word: ''[[golod]]'', they called it a poor harvest ''[[neurozhai]]'' and stopped the papers reporting on it.<ref>Orlando Figes, A People's Tragedy, page 158</ref>. The main reason the blame fell on the government was that grain exports were not banned till mid-August and merchants had a month's warning so they could quickly export their reserves. Minister of Finance [[Ivan Vyshnegradsky]] even opposed this late ban{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}. He was seen as the main cause of the disaster as it was his policy to raise consumer taxes to force peasants to sell more grain{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}. Even Russia's capitalists realized the industrialization drive had been too hard on the peasants{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}.
The government also contributed to the famine indirectly by conscripting peasant sons, sending taxmen to seize livestock when grain ran out, and implementing a system of redemption payments as compensation to landlords who had lost their serfs.

== Relief efforts ==
On November 17, 1891 the government asked the people to form voluntary anti-famine organizations.<ref>People's Tragedy, page 159</ref>
[[Leo Tolstoy]], the most famous volunteer{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}, blamed the [[Tsar]] and the [[Orthodox Church]] for the famine. The Orthodox Church actually banned peasants from accepting his charity as they had excommunicated him. The future Tsar [[Nicholas II]] headed the [[relief committee]] and was a member of the [[finance committee]] three months later, while the Tsar and [[Tsarina]] raised 5 and 12 million roubles respectively. [[Alexander III]]'s sister [[Grand Duchess Elizabeth]] also raised money by selling peasant crafts in [[bazaar]]s. Nicholas II said, "A great honor, but little satisfaction ...I must admit I never even suspected it's [finance committee's] existence".<ref>Andrew Verner, The crisis of russian autocracy page 28</ref>
The [[zemstvo]]s got 150 million roubles from the government to buy food, but were only allowed to loan to peasants who could repay them and were therefore the least needy. Starving peasants had to eat raw donated flour and "[[famine bread]]", a mixture of [[moss]], [[goosefoot]], [[bark]] and [[husks]].
In February of 1892, the government bought 30,000 [[Kirghiz]] horses so the fields could be plowed.

The government's callousness converted [[Lenin]], [[Petr Struve]] and [[Victor Chernov]] to Marxism{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}.
