'''James Houston Davis''' (September 11, 1899 &ndash; November 5, 2000), better known as '''Jimmie Davis''', was a noted [[singer]] of both sacred and popular songs who served two nonconsecutive terms as the [[List of Governors of Louisiana|47th Governor of Louisiana]] (1944&ndash;1948 and 1960&ndash;1964). He is a member of the Country Music Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
Davis was born in 1899 to a [[sharecropping]] couple, the former Sarah Elizabeth Works and Samuel Jones Davis, in the now-[[ghost town]] of Beech Springs near [[Quitman, Louisiana|Quitman]] in [[Jackson Parish, Louisiana|Jackson Parish]].<ref>[http://www.wargs.com/other/davisjh.html Ancestry of Jimmie Davis]</ref> The family was so poor that young Jimmie did not have a bed in which to sleep until he was nine years old.

He graduated from Beech Springs High School and Soule Business College, [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]] campus. The late [[U.S. Representative]] [[Otto Passman|Otto Ernest Passman]], a Louisiana Democrat, also graduated from Soule, but from the [[Bogalusa, Louisiana|Bogalusa]] campus. Davis received his [[bachelor's degree]] in [[history]] from the [[Baptist]]-affiliated [[Louisiana College]] in [[Pineville, Louisiana|Pineville]]. He received a [[master's degree]] from [[Louisiana State University]] in [[Baton Rouge]].  Davis's 1927 master's thesis examines the intelligence levels of different races, and is titled ''Comparative Intelligence of Whites, Blacks and Mulattoes.''<ref>https://lsu.louislibraries.org:5203/uhtbin/cgisirsi/x/0/0/57/5/3?searchdata1=1955955{CKEY}&searchfield1=GENERAL^SUBJECT^GENERAL^^&user_id=WEBSERVER</ref>

Davis taught history (and, unofficially, [[yodeling]]) for a year at the former Dodd College for Girls in [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]] during the late 1920s. He was hired by the college president, [[Monroe E. Dodd|Monroe Elmon Dodd]], who was also the pastor of the large First [[Baptist]] Church of Shreveport and a pioneer [[radio]] preacher.

==Musical career==
Davis became a commercially successful singer of rural music before he entered politics. His early work was in the style of early [[Country Music]] luminary [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]], and he was also known for recording energetic and raunchy blues tunes like "Red Nightgown Blues".  Some of these records included slide guitar accompaniment by black bluesman [[Oscar Woods]]. During his first run for governor, opponents reprinted the lyrics of some of these songs in order to undermine Davis's campaign. In one case, anti-Davis forces played some of the records over an outdoor sound system only to give up after the crowds started dancing, ignoring the double-entendre lyrics.  Davis until the end of his life never denied or repudiated those records.

He is associated with several popular songs, most notably "[[You Are My Sunshine]]", which was designated an official [[state song]] of Louisiana in 1977. He claimed that he wrote the song while attending graduate school at LSU, but research indicates he bought it from another performer, [[Paul Rice (musician)|Paul Rice]],{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} who had recorded it with his brother Hoke, who recorded together as the Rice Brothers under Paul Rice's name. The practice of buying songs from their composers was a common practice during the 1930s through the 1960s as some writers in need of cash often sold tunes to others.

Rice himself had adapted it from another person's poem.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} Reportedly, the song was copyrighted under Davis' name and that of longtime sideman [[Charles Mitchell]], after they purchased it from Rice. Davis also purchased the country ballad "It Makes No Difference Now" from its composer [[Floyd Tillman]]. Tillman later had his composer credit restored alongside that of Davis.

In 1999, "You Are My Sunshine" was honored with a [[Grammy Hall of Fame Award]] and the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] named it one of the [[Songs of the Century]]. "You Are My Sunshine" was ranked No. 73 on ''CMT's 100 Greatest Songs in Country Music'' in 2003. Until his death, Davis insisted that he wrote the song. In any case, it will forever be associated with him.

Davis became the popular "singing governor" who often performed during his campaign stops. While governor, he had a No. 1 hit [[single (music)|single]] in 1945 with "[[There's a New Moon Over My Shoulder]]". A long-time member of the [[Baptist]] faith, he also recorded a number of [[Southern gospel]] [[album]]s and in 1967 served as president of the [[Gospel Music Association]]. He was a close friend of the [[North Dakota]]-born band leader [[Lawrence Welk]] who frequently reminded viewers of his television program of his association with Governor Davis.

A number of his songs were used as part of [[motion picture]] [[soundtrack]]s, and Davis himself appeared in half a dozen films, one with the popular entertainers [[Ozzie and Harriet]]. Members of Davis' last band included [[Allen "Puddler" Harris]] of [[Lake Charles, Louisiana|Lake Charles]], who had also been an original [[pianist]] of [[Ricky Nelson]].

==Movie career==

Davis had several appearances in movies (usually or always as himself), including:
*''[[Strictly in the Groove]]'' (1942)
*''[[Riding Through Nevada]]'' (1942)
*''[[Frontier Fury]]'' (1943)
*''[[Cyclone Prairie Rangers]]'' (1944)
*''[[Louisiana (1947 film)|Louisiana]]'' (1947)
*''[[Mississippi Rhythm]]'' (1949)
*''[[Square Dance Katy]]'' (1950)

==Political career==
Davis was elected as Shreveport's public safety commissioner as a Democrat. (At the time, Shreveport had the [[city commission]] form of government. In the 1970s, the city switched to the current [[mayor-council]] format.) Davis was elected in 1942 to the [[Louisiana Public Service Commission]] but left the rate-making body, which meets in Baton Rouge, two years later to become governor.

===First term as governor (1944&ndash;1948)===
{{See also|Louisiana gubernatorial election, 1944}}

Davis was elected governor as a Democrat in 1944. He defeated [[Lewis L. Morgan]] of [[Covington, Louisiana|Covington]], the seat of [[St. Tammany Parish]], who had been backed by former Governor [[Earl Kemp Long]] and New Orleans Mayor [[Robert Maestri]]. Davis received 251,228 (53.6 percent) to Morgan's 217,915 (46.5 percent). Eliminated in the primary were a number of candidates, including freshman U.S. Representative [[James H. Morrison|James Hobson "Jimmy" Morrison]] of [[Hammond, Louisiana|Hammond]] in [[Tangipahoa Parish]].

Davis pleased conservatives with his appointment of [[Cecil Morgan]] to the Louisiana [[Civil Service]] Commission. Morgan, as a [[Caddo Parish]] legislator, had led the [[impeachment]] forces against [[Governor]] [[Huey Long|Huey Pierce Long, Jr.]] in 1929 and later took a high position with [[Standard Oil Company]]. Morgan was succeeded in the Louisiana House by [[Rupert Peyton]] of Shreveport, who also served as an aide to Davis.

Long was seeking the lieutenant governorship on the Lewis Morgan "ticket" and led in the first primary, but he lost the runoff to [[J. Emile Verret]] of [[New Iberia, Louisiana|New Iberia]], who was the president of the [[Iberia Parish]] [[School Board]].

Davis kept his hand in show business, and set a record for absenteeism during his first term with trips to [[Hollywood]] to make Western "[[horse operas]]."<ref>{{cite journal|last=Mathur |first=Monika |date=June 23, 2009|title=A look at odd behavior by US governors|journal=Associated Press|url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jQ7_25-eKs8eU2rs504vDLRpD6dAD990JHEG0}}</ref> 

Davis was [[term limit|term-limited]] to a single non-consecutive term in office.

===The election of 1959-1960===
{{See also|Louisiana gubernatorial election, 1959-60}}

As a candidate for a second term in 1959&ndash;1960, Davis had been out of office for nearly a dozen years. Three [[Louisiana State University]] political scientists described him, accordingly:

"Davis has all of the external attributes of a 'man of the people', but his serious political connections seem to be with the [parish-seat] elite and its allies, particularly the major industrial combinations of the state. He is in many respects a toned-down version  of the old-style southern politician who could spellbound the mass of voters into supporting him regardless of the effects of his programs on their welfare. . . . Davis creates the perfect image of a man to be trusted and one whose intense calm is calculated to bring rational balance into the political life of the state."<ref>William C. Havard, Rudolf Heberle, and [[Perry H. Howard]], ''The Louisiana Elections of 1960'', [[Baton Rouge]]: [[Louisiana State University]] Studies, 1963, p. 40</ref> 

With a pledge to fight for continued [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]] in public education, Davis won the Democratic [[gubernatorial]] nomination over a crowded field that included staunchly segregationist State Senator [[William M. Rainach|William Monroe Rainach]] of [[Claiborne Parish, Louisiana|Claiborne Parish]], former Lieutenant Governor [[Bill Dodd|William J. "Bill" Dodd]] of [[Baton Rouge]], former Governor [[James A. Noe|James Albert Noe, Sr.]], of [[Monroe, Louisiana|Monroe]], and [[New Orleans]] Mayor [[deLesseps Story Morrison|deLesseps Story Morrison, Sr.]] A member of the [[Ku Klux Klan]], [[A. Roswell Thompson]], the operator of a New Orleans [[taxi stand]], also filed candidacy papers. Davis ran second to "Chep" Morrison, considered an anti-Long [[Liberalism|liberal]] by Louisiana standards, in the primary but then defeated Morrison in the party runoff held in January 1960.

Davis polled 213,551 (25.3 percent) to Morrison's 278,956 (33.1 percent). Rainach ran third with 143,095 (17 percent). Noe was fourth with 97,654 (11.6 percent), and Dodd followed with 85,436 (10.1 percent). Davis won the northern and central parts of the state plus Baton Rouge, while Morrison dominated the southern portion of the state, particularly the [[France|French]] cultural parishes. In the runoff, Davis prevailed, 487,681 (54.1 percent) to Morrison's 414,110 (45.5 percent). It was estimated that Davis drew virtually all of the Rainach support from the first primary.

Earl Long endorsed Davis in the runoff because he had a longstanding personal distaste for Morrison. Long, meanwhile, had run unsuccessfully for [[Lieutenant Governor of Louisiana|lieutenant governor]] in the first primary. There was a runoff between Morrison's choice for the job, Alexandria Mayor [[W. George Bowdon, Jr.]], and Davis's selection, former state House Speaker [[Clarence C. Aycock|Clarence C. "Taddy" Aycock]] of [[Franklin, Louisiana|Franklin]] in [[St. Mary Parish]]. Aycock defeated Bowdon by a margin similar to that of Davis over Morrison. The defeat was Long's second for lieutenant governor. He had lost also in the 1944 primary to [[J. Emile Verret]] of [[Iberia Parish, Louisiana|Iberia Parish]].

Davis effectively used the slogan "He's One of Us" in the gubernatorial race. Number six on the ballot, he assembled an intraparty ticket for other statewide constitutional officers, including Aycock for lieutenant governor, [[Roy R. Theriot]] of [[Abbeville, Louisiana|Abbeville]] for [[comptroller]], [[Douglas Fowler]] of [[Coushatta, Louisiana|Coushatta]] for custodian of voting machines, [[Jack P.F. Gremillion]] for [[attorney general]], [[Dave L. Pearce]] for agriculture commissioner, [[Ellen Bryan Moore]] for register of state lands, and Rufus Hayes for [[insurance]] commissioner, all based in Baton Rouge. The entire Davis ticket was elected.<ref>Davis exhibit, [[Delta Music Museum]], [[Ferriday, Louisiana|Ferriday]], [[Louisiana]]</ref>

In their study ''The Louisiana Election of 1960'', William C. Havard, Rudolf Heberle, and [[Perry H. Howard]] demonstrated that Davis built his second-primary victory by narrowly edging Morrison in the eastern and western extremities of South Louisiana. Davis also secured the backing of [[organized labor]] and made inroads among the white, urban working class, which was essential to a Morrison victory. In the seven urban industrial parishes, which then comprised some 46.5 percent of the total turnout, Davis topped Morrison by 7,368 votes (50.8 percent) of the 419,537 applicable subtotal. Morrison polled 60 percent in his own Orleans Parish and 54.6 percent in adjacent suburban [[Jefferson Parish, Louisiana|Jefferson Parish]], but in the industrial strip and in less Roman Catholic areas, Morrison slipped. The second primary attracted 57,744 more votes than the initial stage of balloting, and analysts indicated that the lion's share of the additional ballots were segregationists who supported Davis.<ref>Havard, Heberle, and Havard, ''The Louisiana Election of 1960'', pp. 50-52</ref>

In the [[general election]] on April 19, 1960, Davis defeated [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Francis Grevemberg]], a [[Lafayette, Louisiana|Lafayette]] native, by a margin of nearly 82<U+2013>17 percent. Grevemberg had been head of the state police under Governor [[Robert F. Kennon]] and had gained a reputation for fighting [[organized crime]]. He called for the origin of a two-party system for Louisiana. As the Democratic nominee, Davis had no worries and did little campaigning against Grevemberg. It has been reported that had [[General]] [[Curtis LeMay]] turned down [[George C. Wallace]]'s offer to be his candidate for vice president in 1968 on the [[American Independent Party]] ticket that Wallace was ready to announce Davis as his selection for vice president.

====Davis and Dodd====

In the 1959 campaign, Bill Dodd had attacked Davis ferociously: it was part of Dodd's strategy to get Davis to withdraw from the primary. "Nothing personal in his [Dodd's] heart, just a cold-blooded plan to wind up in a second primary against Morrison, who he figured could not win against anyone [else] in a runoff," said Davis in the introduction to Dodd's memoirs, ''Peapatch Politics: The Earl Long Era in Louisiana Politics''. Dodd then endorsed Morrison in the runoff, but he had a long-term reason for doing so. Dodd planned to run for school superintendent in the 1963 primary, and he wanted to have at least the neutrality of Morrison four years thereafter.

Dodd and Davis later became close friends. In Davis' words:

:Bill and I have many things in common. We share the same type of religion and boyhood background; we got our start as schoolteachers and figured prominently in public education; we both served in public life at or near the top. And I like to feel that we share a common appreciation and respect for people, all people. One of the greatest rewards in politics is meeting people. And one of the greatest and most unusual men I've ever met is Bill Dodd.

===Second term (1960-1964)===

Davis' appointees in the second term included outgoing State Representative [[Claude Kirkpatrick]] of [[Jennings, Louisiana|Jennings]], the seat of [[Jefferson Davis Parish]], who was named to succeed [[Lorris M. Wimberly]] as the Director of [[Public Works]]. In that capacity, Kirkpatrick took the steps for a joint agreement with the [[State of Texas|Texas]] to establish the popular [[Toledo Bend Reservoir]], a haven for [[boating]] and [[fishing]]. Mrs. Kirkpatrick, the former [[Edith Killgore Kirkpatrick|Edith Killgore]], a native of Claiborne Parish in north Louisiana, headed Davis's women's campaign division for southwestern Louisiana. He appointed Alexandria businessman [[Morgan W. Walker, Sr.]], to the State Mineral Board. Walker founded a company which later became part of [[Continental Trailways]] [[Bus]] lines. Davis named [[Ray Burgess]] of  Baton Rouge as highway director, who even considered running for governor in the 1963 primary.<ref>Havard, Heberle, and Howard, ''The Louisiana Election of 1960'', p. 99</ref>

In his second term, Davis secured passage of a $60 million public improvements [[bond issue]] through the State Board and Building Commission, an organization controlled by the governor. He gained legislative support from many formerly pro-Long lawmakers and cemented his hold on the traditional anti-Long bloc. He avoided defeat on any legislation that he strongly supported and was able to defeat nearly all bills with which he did not concur. He offered tacit support to the [[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] national Democrats to secure the state's hold of pending offshore oil revenues. In the 1963 legislative fiscal session, he defeated efforts to procure an unpledged presidential elector slate for the 1964 general election, by which time he had been succeeded by [[John J. McKeithen]].<ref>Havard, Heberle, and Howard, ''The Louisiana Elections of 1960'', pp. 90-92</ref>

==Fourth place in 1971==
{{Main|Louisiana gubernatorial election, 1971-72}}
In 1971, Davis entered another crowded Democratic [[gubernatorial]] primary field with new political prospects, but he finished in  fourth place with 138,756 ballots (11.8 percent).

In a runoff election held in December 1971, U.S. Representative [[Edwin Washington Edwards]] of [[Crowley, Louisiana|Crowley]] in [[Acadia Parish]] defeated then state Senator [[Bennett Johnston|J. Bennett Johnston, Jr.]], of [[Shreveport]] for the party nomination. That vote was close: Edwards, 584,262 (50.2 percent) to Johnston's 579,774 (49.8 percent). Edwards then beat Republican [[David C. Treen]] in the March 1972 [[general election]]. Davis' days as a politician were clearly behind him at that point.

Toward the end of his life, longtime Democrat Davis endorsed at least two Republican candidates: state Representative [[Woody Jenkins|Louis E. "Woody" Jenkins]] of Baton Rouge for the U.S. Senate against Democrat [[Mary Landrieu]] in 1996 and the reelection of Governor [[Mike Foster|Murphy J. "Mike" Foster, Jr.]], who faced little opposition in 1999 from [[African-American]] Democratic Congressman [[Bill Jefferson|William "Bill" Jefferson]] of New Orleans.<ref>Jefferson, a former assistant to [[United States Senator]] [[J. Bennett Johnston]], was engulfed in personal financial scandals in 2006 and subsequently defeated by [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Joseph Cao|Anh "Joseph" Cao]] in 2008.</ref>

==Political legacy==
Davis established a State Retirement System and funding of more than $100 million in public improvements while leaving the state with a $38 million surplus after his first term.<ref>[http://www.sec.state.la.us/67.htm Louisiana Secretary of State<!--Bot-generated title-->]</ref>

During his second term, Davis built the Sunshine Bridge, the new [[Louisiana Governor's Mansion]], and Toledo Bend Reservoir, all criticized at the time, but later recognized as beneficial to the state. Davis coordinated the pay periods of state employees, who had sometimes received their checks a week late, a particular hardship to those with low incomes.

During his time as governor, Davis attempted to enforce policies of racial segregation, but federal law slowly brought about [[desegregation]]. One time during his tenure, he rode his horse up the steps of the [[Louisiana State Capitol]] to protest integration. Davis apologized for his actions later in life. {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

==Honors==
[[Image:Jimmie Davis Bridge, Shreveport, LA IMG 1555.JPG|200px|left|thumb|The Jimmie Davis Bridge over the [[Red River of the South|Red River]] on Louisiana State Highway 511 connects [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]] and [[Bossier City, Louisiana|Bossier City]].</font size=2>]]

The '''Jimmie Davis Bridge''' atop the [[Red River (Mississippi watershed)|Red River]] connects Shreveport and [[Bossier City, Louisiana|Bossier City]] via Louisiana Highway 511. It was named in his honor during his second term as governor.

[[Jimmie Davis State Park]] is located on Caney Lake, southwest of [[Chatham, Louisiana|Chatham]] in Jackson Parish. 

Davis was inducted into the [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]] in 1971 and into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]] in 1972. In 1993, he was among the first 13 inductees of the [[Louisiana Political Museum and Hall of Fame]] in [[Winnfield, Louisiana|Winnfield]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cityofwinnfield.com/museum.html|title=<U+201D>Louisiana Political Museum and Hall of Fame<U+201D>|publisher=cityofwinnfield.com|accessdate=August 22, 2009}}</ref> The Hall of Fame also periodically issues the "Friends of Jimmie Davis Award". The 2006 recipient was former State Senator [[B.G. Dyess]], a retired Baptist minister from [[Rapides Parish, Louisiana|Rapides Parish]]. 

Davis believed that his singing career enhanced his political prospects. He once told [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Ronnie Thompson (Georgia politician)|Ronnie Thompson]], a [[mayor]] of [[Macon, Georgia|Macon]]: "If you want to have any success in politics, sing softly and carry a big [[guitar]]," a play on an old [[Theodore Roosevelt]] [[adage]].<ref>Davis, quoted in Eric Welch, "Gospel-singing Jeweler Is 'Country' Candidate", ''Macon Telegraph'', 1967 August 26, p. A1.</ref>

==Personal life==
[[Image:Eglin House in Shreveport IMG 1571.JPG|200px|right|thumb|Davis married the former Alverna Adams in this historic Shreveport house in the Highlands neighborhood. It was formerly owned by the Eglins, the maternal grandparents of Davis' second successor as governor, [[John McKeithen]].<ref>Source: Historic marker, Eglin House in Shreveport</ref>]]

Davis' first wife, the former Alverna Adams, from a prominent Shreveport family, was first lady while he was governor. She died in 1967. He thereafter married Anna Carter Gordon, a member of the [[Chuck Wagon Gang]] [[gospel music|gospel singers]] based in [[Nashville]].<ref>See also [[J. Bazzel Mull]].</ref> She survived Davis.

Out of office, Davis resided primarily in Baton Rouge but made numerous singing appearances, particularly in churches throughout the United States.

He died at the probable age of 101 and is buried in the Davis Family Cemetery in Quitman in his native Jackson Parish. He lived longer than any other former state governor. Davis was [[Posthumous recognition|posthumously]] inducted into the [[Delta Music Museum]] Hall of Fame in [[Ferriday, Louisiana|Ferriday]].
