The '''Air Battle of South Korea''' was an air campaign early in the [[Korean War]] occurring roughly from June 25 to July 20, 1950 over [[South Korea]] between the air forces of [[North Korea]] and the [[United Nations]], including the countries of South Korea, the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. The month-long fight for air supremacy over the country saw several small engagements over airfields in [[Seoul]] and [[Taejon]] and ultimately ended in victory for the UN air force, which was able to destroy the small North Korean [[Korean People's Air Force|People's Air Force]].

==Background==
::''Main Article:  [[Korean War#Police Action: US intervention|Initial Phase of Korean War]]
On the night of June 25, 1950, ten divisions of the [[North Korean People's Army]] launched a full-scale invasion of the nation's neighbor to the south, the [[Republic of Korea]]. The force of 89,000&nbsp;men moved in six columns, catching the [[Republic of Korea Army]] by surprise, resulting in a rout. The smaller South Korean army suffered from widespread lack of organization and equipment, and was unprepared for war.<ref>{{harvnb|Alexander|2003|p=1}}</ref> The numerically superior North Korean forces destroyed isolated resistance from the 38,000&nbsp;South Korean soldiers on the front before it began moving steadily south.<ref>{{harvnb|Alexander|2003|p=2}}</ref> 

To prevent South Korea's collapse the [[United Nations Security Council]] voted to send military forces. The United States' [[United States Seventh Fleet|Seventh Fleet]] dispatched [[Task Force 77 (U.S. Navy)|Task Force 77]], led by the [[fleet carrier]] [[USS Valley Forge (CV-45)|USS ''Valley Forge'']]; the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Far East Fleet]] dispatched several ships, including [[HMS Triumph (R16)|HMS ''Triumph'']], to provide air and naval support.<ref>{{harvnb|Malkasian|2001|p=23}}</ref> By June 27, the naval and air forces moving to Korea had authorization to attack North Korean targets with the goal of helping repel the North Korean invasion of the country.<ref>{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=38}}</ref> With the US forces accepting the North Korean attack as an act of war, it became imperative to evacuate civilians and American diplomats from Korea, as the forces of the north and south were battling across the peninsula. On June 27 the South Koreans were losing the [[First Battle of Seoul]].<ref name="Apple39">{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=39}}</ref> Most of South Korea's forces retreated in the face of the invasion. The North Koreans would capture the city the next day forcing the South Korean government and its shattered army to retreat further south.<ref>{{harvnb|Varhola|2000|p=2}}</ref> 

In the meantime, US naval and air forces were evacuating US diplomats, military dependents, and civilians by ship and air transport, hoping to get American civilians out of the country "by any means." Civilians were being gathered at [[Suwon]] and [[Kimpo Airfield]] in Seoul, before moving to [[Inchon]] and out of the country. These airlifts and convoys were being escorted by aircraft from the [[Far East Air Force (United States)|United States]], which was operating its aircraft from bases in Japan.<ref name="Apple39"/> The two Koreas had very small air forces of their own, with the North Koreans' 132 aircraft organized into the [[1st Air Division (North Korea)|1st Air Division]]. At the early phase in the war, these aircraft were used boldly to the North Koreans' advantage.<ref>{{harvnb|Futrell|1997|p=19}}</ref>

== Battle ==
North Korean aircraft first met US aircraft in combat during the [[Action of 27 June 1950]], in which seven of the 13 North Korean aircraft were destroyed. The North Korean [[Lavochkin La-7]] and [[Ilyushin Il-10]] aircraft were easily outmatched by the superior American [[F-82 Twin Mustang]] and [[F-80C Shooting Star]] aircraft, which also had better-trained pilots. The planes of the [[8th Fighter Wing]], which were attempting to defend [[Suwon]] to allow evacuation of UN civilians encountered repeated harassing attacks from North Korean aircraft operating out of Heijo Airfield near [[Pyongyang]]. Heijo was the North Koreans' main airstrip, but in the first few days in the war the US aircraft only had authorization to defend themselves if attacked, they could not conduct offensive operations into North Korea.<ref>{{harvnb|Futrell|1997|p=13}}</ref> 

During the day on 29 June, the North Korean aircraft returned to attack Suwon, and six sorties of North Korean aircraft strafed the airfield during the morning, but each time were driven off by American F-80s, and in the course of these attacks Lieutenant William T. Norris and Lieutenant Roy W. Marsh each shot down a North Korean aircraft. The North Koreans were able to destroy a single [[C-54 Skymaster]] parked at the airfield. The sorties culminated in a battle above Suwon in the midst of a conference of US military leaders in the town. Leaders including [[US Lieutenant General]] [[George E. Stratemeyer]] and [[General of the Army]] [[Douglass MacArthur]] personally witnessed the final sortie of the day, in which four North Korean aircraft attacked four [[F-51 Mustang]] aircraft over the town. The four F-51s succeeded in shooting down all four of the North Korean aircraft, with Lieutenant Orrin R. Fox scoring two kills and Lieutenants Richard J. Burns, and Harry T. Sandlin scoring one each. MacArthur subsequently authorized Stratemeyer to launch strikes into North Korea to destroy North Koran airfields and establish [[air superiority]] for the US forces.<ref>{{harvnb|Futrell|1997|p=31}}</ref>

As soon as MacArthur cleared US aircraft to enter North Korea, the [[8th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron]] sent aircraft to scout all of North Korea's airfields. By the afternoon, the aircraft had not completed their scouting missions but a bombing mission was nonetheless ordered against Heijo Airfield. At 16:15, 18 [[B-26 Invader]]s of the [[3rd Bombardment Group]] took off from airbases in Japan for strikes against the airfield. These would be the first offensive action against North Korea. The aircraft arrived at the airfield just after dark. There they found a substantial number of aircraft from North Korea's 1st Air Division parked on the tarmac, caught completely by surprise. The US aircraft subsequently placed their fragmentation bombs along the hangar line, ramps, and revetment areas. In the confusion, the North Koreans were only able to get one aircraft off the ground to oppose the flight, a [[Yak-3]]. The aircraft was quickly shot down by [[Staff Sergeant]] Nyle S. Mickley, a gunner aboard one of the bombers. By the end of the raid, the US aircraft destroyed an estimated 25 North Korean aircraft on the ground and one in the air while suffering no aircraft lost.<ref>{{harvnb|Futrell|1997|p=32}}</ref>
