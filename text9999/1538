The '''Tripuri''' (Tipra or Tipperah) people are the original inhabitants of the state of [[Tripura]] in [[North-East India]]. The Tripuri people through the Royal family of the [[Debbarma]]'s ruled the state of Tripura for more than 2000 years till the kingdom joined the Indian Union in 1949.

The Tripuri's live on the slopes of hills in a group of five to fifty families. Their houses in these areas are built of [[bamboo]] or '''ua''' as it is called in [[Kokborok]] and raised five to six feet height to save themselves from the dangers of the wild animals. Nowadays a considerable section of this community are living in the plains and erecting houses like the plains' people adopting their methods of cultivation and following them in other aspects of life, such as dress, manners and cosmetics. Tripuri women rear a scarp, called '''Pachra''', which reaches down just below the knee. They weave in their loin-loom a small piece of cloth, which they call '''[[Risa]]''', and they use this small piece of cloth as their breast garment.

==History==
The Tripuri people are considered part of the Tibeto-Burmese ethnic group. Originally they migrated from near the upper courses of the [[Yangtze]] kiang and the [[Hwang Ho]] rivers in [[Western China]]. They had left [[China]] long before the [[Sui dynasty]] came to power. At the time of migration they were [[animist]]s. So it may be reasonably assumed that they migrated before 65 AD, the year [[Buddhism]] was introduced in China. The common reference to the Mongoloid people as "[[Kiratas]]" and "[[Cinas]]" in the early [[Sanskrit]] texts of India unmistakably indicates that they came down to the [[Assam valley]] long before the dawn of Christian era.

Tripuris entered their present country through its north-eastern corner , settled there and gradually expanded their settlement and suzerainty over the whole of [[Tripura]]. They were able to expand their influence as far south as [[Chittagong]], as far west as [[Comilla]] and [[Noakhali]] (known during the British period as 'plains Tipwrah') and as far north as [[Sylhet]] (all in present [[Bangladesh]]). Hardly their forefathers could imagine that their descendants were destined to build a strong monarchy and resist the advance of the [[Mughals]]. The ruling dynasty passed through several vicissitudes of history and ruled Tripura for several centuries till up to 14 October 1949, the day Tripura was annexed by India.

The main Tripuri tribes, viz..

1. [[Debbarma]] or [[Tipra]] , from which the royal family [[Debbarman]] ruled the kingdom.

2. [[Reang]] or Bru

3. [[Jamatia]]

4. [[Koloi]]

5. [[Noatia]]

6. [[Murasing]]

7. [[Halam]]

8. [[Uchoi]]

==Language==
{{main|Kokborok}}
The Tripuri people mainly speak various dialects of '''Kokborok''', the standard dialect of the  [[Debbarma]] tribe spoken around [[Agartala]] and the second official language of [[Tripura]]. There are estimated to be 1,000,000 speakers of the various dialects of [[Kokborok]] in Tripura, others being in [[Mizoram]] & [[Assam]] in [[India]] and [[Sylhet]] and [[Chittagong]] Hill Tracts in [[Bangladesh]].

''See main article for [[Tripuri culture]]''.

The indigenous Tripuri people comprises of various hill tribal communities viz., [[Tipra]], [[Reang]], [[Jamatia]], [[Kaipeng]], [[Noatia]], [[Koloi]], [[Halam]],etc. who migrated to this land in successive waves in the ancient past. They grew in isolation and were sometimes subjugated by one another. Each community had its own elementary social and administrative organization starting from the village level and up to the chieftainship of the whole tribe. The tribes enjoy their traditional freedom based on the concept of self-determination. The relation between the king and the subject tribes was as [[Maharaja]] (king) of [[Tripura-Missip]] or [[liaison officer]] [[Roy]] of Headman of the tribe - [[Sardar]] of chief of the village-the individual.

The Tripuri people have a rich historical, social and cultural heritage which is totally distinct from that of the mainland Indians, their distinctive culture as reflected in their [[dance]], [[music]], [[festivals]], management of [[community affairs]], [[dress]] and [[food]] habit has a strong [[Mongoloid]] Base. [[Kokborok]], the linguafranca of the twelve largest linguistic groups of the indigenous Tripuris and other dialects spoken in Trpura are of the [[Tibeto-Burman]] group as distinct from those spoken in India. There is no influence whatsoever of from those spoken by other Mongoloid peoples in the North-eastern region.

==Tripuri Games and Sports==
''See main article [[Tripuri Games and Sports]].''

Like many parts of the world the Tripuri has traditional sports. It is common in almost all the clans of Tripuri. It is called '''Thwngmung''' in Tripuri. Tripuris are by nature very sporting person. They love to play these game and enjoy their free time by playing various game and sports of their favorite. Now a days these traditional sports are being abandoned gradually and they are attracted to modern games and sports. But some of the sports are even today played and preferred in rural Tripura. Out of many traditional Tripuri games and sports some are listed below: 

*Achugwi Phan Sohlaimung
*Bumanikotor
*Dwkhwi Sotonmung
*Phan Sohlaimung
*Kaldong or Kadong
*Longoi Chokmung
*Muphuk Sagwnang
*Musta Seklaio
*Sohlaimmung

==Issues==
The Tripuri people have been reduced to a minority in Tripura due to the large scale migration of the Bengali people since Tripura kingdom joined [[India]] from 1949. '''From a majority of 80% population in 1901 [[census]] they constituted just 30% according to the 2001 census of India'''.

These has resulted in wide-spread insurgency and militancy in the state with groups such as TNV ([[Tripura National Volunteers]]), NLFT ([[National Liberation Front of Tripura]]) and ATTF ([[All Tripura Tiger Force]]), whose main motive is to secede from India and drive away the Bengali people and regain the independence the kingdom.
