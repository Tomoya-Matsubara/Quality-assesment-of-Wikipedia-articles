'''Alexander Augustus Norman Dudley Pentland''' [[Military Cross|MC]], [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|DFC]], [[Air Force Cross (United Kingdom)|AFC]] (5 August 1894 &ndash; before 7&nbsp;November 1983) was an Australian [[flying ace|fighter ace]] in [[World War I]]. Born in [[Maitland, New South Wales|Maitland]], New South Wales, he commenced service as a [[Australian Light Horse|Lighthorseman]] with the [[First Australian Imperial Force|Australian Imperial Force]] in 1915, and saw action at [[Gallipoli campaign|Gallipoli]]. He transferred to the [[Royal Flying Corps]] the following year, rising to [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|Captain]]. Credited with twenty-three aerial victories, Pentland became the fifth highest-scoring Australian ace of the war, after [[Robert A. Little|Robert Little]], [[Roderic Dallas]], [[Arthur Henry Cobby|Harry Cobby]] and [[Elwyn King]]. He was awarded the [[Military Cross]] in January 1918 for "conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty" on a mission attacking an aerodrome behind enemy lines, and the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] that August for engaging four hostile aircraft single-handedly. 

Pentland served in the fledgling [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF), and later the [[Royal Air Force]], before going into business in 1927. His ventures included commercial flying around the goldfields of [[Territory of New Guinea|New Guinea]], aircraft design and manufacture, flight instruction, and charter work. In the early 1930s, he was employed as a pilot with [[Australian National Airways]], and also spent time as a dairy farmer. Soon after the outbreak of [[World War II]], he re-enlisted in the RAAF, attaining the rank of [[Squadron Leader]] and commanding rescue and communications units in the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|South West Pacific]]. Perhaps the oldest operational pilot in the wartime RAAF, Pentland was responsible for rescuing a number of airmen, soldiers and civilians, and earned the [[Air Force Cross (United Kingdom)|Air Force Cross]] for his "outstanding courage, initiative and skill". He became a trader in New Guinea when the war ended in 1945, and later a coffee planter. Retiring in 1959, he died in 1983 at the age of eighty-nine.

==Early life==
Of Irish ancestry, Alexander Augustus Norman Dudley Pentland (nicknamed "Jerry") was born in [[Maitland, New South Wales|Maitland]], New South Wales on 5&nbsp;August 1894.<ref name="Newton">Newton, ''Australian Air Aces'', pp. 52&ndash;53</ref><ref name="Obit">{{cite journal | date = 8 November 1983| title = Veteran of Western Front dogfights| url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=vm0pAAAAIBAJ&sjid=oegDAAAAIBAJ&dq=alexander%20pentland&pg=4149%2C2892140 | journal = [[The Sydney Morning Herald]] | page=p. 14 | accessdate = on 10 January 2010}}</ref> Educated at [[The King's School, Parramatta|The King's School]], Sydney, and [[Brighton Grammar School|Brighton Grammar]], Melbourne, he went on to study dairy farming at [[Hawkesbury Agricultural College]], and later worked as a [[Stockman|jackaroo]].<ref name="Obit"/><ref name="Schaedel p. 13">Schaedel, ''Australian Air Ace'', p. 13</ref>  His father, also named Alexander, was a physician who joined the [[First Australian Imperial Force|Australian Imperial Force]] (AIF) during [[World War I]] and served as a [[Major]] in the [[Royal Australian Army Medical Corps|Australian Army Medical Corps]].<ref name="Schaedel p. 13"/><ref name="AIF">[http://www.aif.adfa.edu.au:8080/showPerson?pid=238364 Alexander Augustus Norman Dudley Pentland] at [http://www.aif.adfa.edu.au:8080/index.html The AIF Project].

==World War I==
Pentland enlisted as a [[Private (rank)|private]] in the AIF on 5&nbsp;March 1915, sailing for Egypt with the [[Australian Mounted Division|12th Light Horse Regiment]] aboard HMAT A29 ''Suevic'' on 13&nbsp;June.<ref name="Newton"/><ref name="AIF"/> In August, his unit deployed to [[Gallipoli campaign|Gallipoli]],<ref>[http://www.awm.gov.au/units/unit_10571.asp 12th Light Horse Regiment] at [[Australian War Memorial]].

Though the slow and vulnerable B.E.2 was considered "[[Fokker]] fodder" by its crews, Pentland and his observer quickly managed to score the former's first aerial victory, bringing down a German [[Fokker Eindecker|''Eindecker'']] over [[Haubourdin|Habourdin]] on 9&nbsp;June.<ref name="Newton"/><ref name="Guttman">Guttman, ''SPAD VII Aces of World War 1'', pp. 42&ndash;45</ref> He was then posted to [[No. 29 Squadron RAF|No.&nbsp;29 Squadron]] and was converting to [[Airco DH.2|DH.2]] [[Pusher configuration|"pusher"]] fighters when he broke his leg playing rugby. After recovering, he [[Flight instructor|instructed]] at [[London Colney]] until June 1917, when he joined [[No. 19 Squadron RAF|No.&nbsp;19 Squadron]], flying [[SPAD S.VII]]s. This would become Pentland's favourite type due to its strength and manouverability, even though it had to be 'flown' constantly and was unforgiving at low speed.<ref name="Garrison"/><ref name="Guttman"/> 

[[File:SADS7BRIT.jpg|thumb|260px|right|SPAD S.VII of the Royal Flying Corps|alt=Military biplane parked on airfield]]
On 20&nbsp;July 1917, soon after arriving at his new unit in France, Pentland achieved his first victory in the SPAD when he shared in the destruction of an [[Albatros Flugzeugwerke|Albatros]] two-seater. He followed this up with a solo "kill" on 12&nbsp;August.<ref name="Guttman"/> Four days later, after stopping an enemy truck convoy in its tracks by crippling its lead vehicle with machine-gun fire, he reportedly engaged ten Albatros fighters single-handedly; by the time he had driven them off, four bullets had penetrated his leather flying suit without injuring him, while his plane had absorbed so much punishment that it had to be scrapped when he got back to base.<ref name="Garrison"/><ref name="Guttman"/> After sharing another Albatros two-seater on 20&nbsp;August, Pentland led a raid on Marcke aerodrome, home of [[Manfred von Richthofen|Baron von Richtofen]]'s [[Jasta 11|''Jasta''&nbsp;11]], on 26&nbsp;August. On the way, he helped bring down a [[DFW C.V|DFW&nbsp;C.V]], then achieved complete surprise at the airfield, which he and his flight proceeded to shoot up. On the return journey, he strafed an enemy train until his guns jammed and then, having managed to clear them, engaged two more German scouts. His part in the raid earned him the [[Military Cross]], which was promulgated in ''[[The London Gazette]]'' on 9&nbsp;January 1918:<ref name="Guttman"/><ref>{{LondonGazette|supp=yes|issue=30466|startpage=635|date=9 January 1918 |accessdate=10 January 2010}}</ref>

{{quote|T./2nd Lt. Alexander Augustus Norman Pentland, Gen. List and R.F.C.

For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty. On a recent occasion he flew to an aerodrome fifteen miles behind the enemy lines, descended to within twenty feet of the ground, and fired into eight hostile machines. On his return journey he attacked a train with considerable effect from a low altitude. He has in addition brought down several enemy machines, and has always set a splendid example of fearlessness and devotion to duty in attacking enemy balloons and troops on the ground.}}

Credited with one more victory during August 1917, and another four the following month, Pentland's score stood at ten when he was injured on 26&nbsp;September after an artillery shell struck his SPAD and forced him to crash land. Following his recovery, he again spent time instructing before being posted back to a front-line unit, this time [[No. 87 Squadron RAF|No.&nbsp;87 Squadron]], operating [[Sopwith Dolphin]]s.<ref name="Garrison"/><ref name="Guttman"/> Promoted [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|Captain]], he returned to France in April 1918, having transferred the same month with the rest of the RFC to the newly formed [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF).<ref name="Schaedel pp. 51-56">Schaedel, ''Australian Air Ace'', pp. 51&ndash;56</ref> Pentland went on to achieve thirteen victories with No.&nbsp;87 Squadron, where his aggressive tactics saw him dubbed the "Wild Australian" by colleagues.

A gallant flight commander, who in the last three months has destroyed two enemy machines and driven down four out of control.

On 25&nbsp;August, Pentland attacked and destroyed two German planes, a DFW two-seater and [[Fokker D.VII]], before himself being shot down and wounded in the foot.<ref name="Newton"/><ref name="Franks"/> These would be his last victories; his grand total of twenty-three included eleven destroyed, one of which was shared, and twelve out of control, three of them shared.<ref name="Franks"/><ref>Shores, ''British and Empire Aces of World War 1'', p. 83</ref> This score ranked him fifth among the Australian aces of the war after [[Robert A. Little|Robert Little]], [[Roderic Dallas]], [[Arthur Henry Cobby|Harry Cobby]] and [[Elwyn King]].<ref>Garrison, ''Australian Fighter Aces'', p. 27</ref>

==Between the wars==
Pentland relinquished his RAF commission and returned to Australia at the end of the war, earning money by giving joyrides to paying customers in an [[Avro 504K|Avro&nbsp;504K]]. Looking for a more secure future, he joined the newly established [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) in August 1921, following an interview with [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]] [[Stanley Goble]], a wartime acquaintance through the RAF. Ranked [[Flight Lieutenant]], Pentland was put in charge of the RAAF's complement of [[Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5|S.E.5]] fighters at [[Point Cook, Victoria|Point Cook]], Victoria, part of the 'Imperial Gift' recently donated by Great Britain.<ref name="Garrison"/><ref>Schaedel, ''Australian Air Ace'', pp. 62&ndash;70</ref> The young Air Force had the atmosphere of a flying club, where everyone knew everyone else. However, tensions sometimes arose between those who had served with British forces during the war, and those who had belonged to the Australian Flying Corps (AFC); the former considered that they were discriminated against when it came to filling senior positions, and came the day Pentland and fellow ex-RAF member [[Hippolyte De La Rue]] threw an "uppity" AFC man into a [[mess]] fireplace.<ref>Schaedel, ''Australian Air Ace'', p. 73</ref> Deciding that his RAAF career was not progressing, Pentland applied for a short-service commission as a [[Flying Officer]] with the RAF in 1923, which was granted as of 23&nbsp;April.<ref name="Schaedel pp. 73-77">Schaedel, ''Australian Air Ace'', pp. 73&ndash;77</ref><ref>{{LondonGazette|supp=yes|issue=30466|startpage=3150|date=1 May 1923|accessdate=10 January 2010}}</ref> He journeyed to Britain with new wife Madge, whom he had married just before departing Australia; they had one daughter, Carleen, the following year.<ref name="Schaedel pp. 73-77"/> Pentland completed the course at [[Central Flying School]], Uphavon and became an instructor there, gaining promotion to Flight Lieutenant before leaving active service with the RAF on 20&nbsp;July 1926 and returning to Australia.<ref>Schaedel, ''Australian Air Ace'', pp. 77&ndash;78</ref><ref>{{LondonGazette|supp=yes|issue=33184|startpage=4802|date=20 July 1926|accessdate=10 January 2010}}</ref>

In 1927, Pentland formed Mandated Territory Airways with entrepreneur Albert Royal to fly freight to and from the goldfields of New Guinea. The pair bought a [[de Havilland DH.60 Moth|DH.60&nbsp;Moth]] biplane, which Pentland ferried to the firm's base at [[Lae]] in February 1928.<ref>Schaedel, ''Australian Air Ace'', pp. 82&ndash;83</ref> The business prospered in the short term, to the extent that the partners took on another Moth and more pilots. By the end of the year, however, Pentland was suffering from [[malaria]] and had to abandon the venture, selling one of the planes to Guinea Airways and returning to Australia with the other.<ref>Schaedel, ''Australian Air Ace'', p. 86</ref> After recovering in the new year, he embarked on a series of new enterprises, including aircraft manufacture, a flying school, and charter work. In February 1929, he formed the General Aircraft Company with Royal and another partner to produce an Australian-designed aeroplane, the Genairco, of which eight were eventually sold. With the Moth from Mandated Territory Airways, he established Pentland's Flying School at [[Sydney Airport|Mascot]], New South Wales. He also flew charters with a Moth owned by ''The Sun'' newspaper, using the same aircraft that September to compete in the [[Western Australian Centenary Air Race|East-West Air Race]] from Sydney to Perth, as part of the celebrations for the [[Centenary of Western Australia|Western Australia Centenary]]. The event attracted a number of veteran aviators of World War&nbsp;I, including [[Horrie Miller (aviator)|Horrie Miller]]&mdash;the eventual winner on handicap&mdash;and [[Charles Eaton (RAAF officer)|Charles Eaton]], whom Pentland beat into fifth place across the line.<ref>Schaedel, ''Australian Air Ace'', pp. 87&ndash;96</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=http://150.theage.com.au/view_bestofarticle.asp?straction=update&inttype=1&intid=621|title=East-West Air Race Ends|journal=[[The Age]]|date=7 October 1929|accessdate=on 24 January 2010}}</ref> 

Lack of patronage led to Pentland folding his businesses and taking a job in 1930 as a pilot with [[Australian National Airways]] (ANA), a new airline founded by [[Charles Kingsford-Smith]] and [[Charles Ulm]].<ref name="Garrison"/><ref>Schaedel, ''Australian Air Ace'', pp. 96&ndash;97</ref> By 1932, ANA was in trouble as well, and Pentland left to set up as a dairy farmer on a property he bought at [[Singleton, New South Wales|Singleton]]. Within two years, drought forced him to sell the land and he returned to earning his living as a pilot, instructing at aero clubs in [[Queensland]] and [[New South Wales]].<ref>Schaedel, ''Australian Air Ace'', pp. 102&ndash;103</ref> By late 1937, he was again employed as a transport pilot in New Guinea, where he was known as a practical joker who liked to hold a map in front of his face in apparent short-sightedness and ask his passengers if they could see a landing ground anywhere. He returned to Australia after [[Military history of Australia during World War II|war was declared]] in September 1939.<ref>Schaedel, ''Australian Air Ace'', pp. 108&ndash;114, 157&ndash;158</ref>

==World War II and later life==

Having offered his services to the Australian government on his return from New Guinea, Pentland rejoined the RAAF on 17&nbsp;June 1940. He undertook the course at [[Central Flying School RAAF|Central Flying School]] in [[Camden, New South Wales|Camden]], New South Wales, and was posted as an instructor to elementary training schools at bases in eastern Australia, including [[Brisbane]], [[Tamworth, New South Wales|Tamworth]], [[Temora, New South Wales|Temora]], [[Bundaberg, Queensland|Bundaberg]], and [[Lowood, Queensland|Lowood]]. Addressed by a young pilot at one school as "Pop", Pentland responded in front of a large audience, "I'm sorry son, but I don't remember sleeping with your mother".<ref>Schaedel, ''Australian Air Ace'', pp. 114&ndash;115</ref> Ranked Flight Lieutenant, he was appointed [[Commanding Officer]] (CO) of No.&nbsp;1 Communication Flight at [[Port Moresby]], New Guinea, in June 1942.<ref name="AWM"/><ref>Schaedel, ''Australian Air Ace'', pp. 117&ndash;119</ref> The [[Australia in the War of 1939<U+2013>1945|official history of Australia in the war]] described this as the RAAF's "most unusual operational unit", asserting that its "strange assortment of light aircraft was as varied and as appropriate to its task as was the flying record of its commander&nbsp;...".<ref name="Gillison">Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/30.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939&ndash;1942'', p. 634]</ref> Beginning with a single [[De Havilland Dragon|DH.84 Dragon]], its inventory eventually included such types as the [[de Havilland Tiger Moth|Tiger Moth]], [[de Havilland Fox Moth|Fox Moth]], [[De Havilland Dragonfly|DH.90 Dragonfly]], [[De Havilland DH.50|DH.50]], [[Piper J-3|Piper Cub]], [[Avro Anson]], [[Supermarine Walrus]], [[PBY Catalina]], and [[Dornier Do 24]].<ref name="Units">RAAF Historical Section, ''Units of the Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 186</ref> Perhaps the RAAF's oldest pilot in any theatre of operations, Pentland was responsible for the rescue of seven downed US airmen the same month he assumed command, and later civilians and Australian soldiers fleeing from the Japanese invasion of [[Rabaul]]. He also organised aerial surveys around [[Daru]] and [[Milne Bay]], developing new bases and emergency airfields at locales such as [[Benabena (Papua New Guinea)|Bena Bena]], [[Abau]], [[Kulpi]], and Port Moresby.<ref name="AWM"/><ref name="Gillison"/> 

By 30&nbsp;November 1942, Pentland had been promoted [[Squadron Leader]] and his unit was reformed at Port Moresby as Rescue and Communication Squadron, but remained better known as "Pentland's Flying Circus". Posted back to Australia in June 1943,<ref name="Units"/><ref>Schaedel, ''Australian Air Ace'', pp. 121, 134</ref> he received radar training before taking command of No.&nbsp;3 Communication Unit at [[Mascot, New South Wales|Mascot]] in November, and helping to set up the RAAF<U+2019>s early warning grid in northern Australia.<ref name="AWM"/><ref>Schaedel, ''Australian Air Ace'', pp. 135&ndash;137</ref> He returned to New Guinea in March 1944 as CO of No.&nbsp;8 Communication Unit, [[Goodenough Island]], which had been formed in November 1943 from Pentland's old Rescue and Communications Squadron. With [[Bristol Beaufort]], [[CAC Boomerang]], [[Bristol Beaufighter]], and [[A-31 Vengeance]] combat aircraft added to its complement, the unit performed reconnaissance and bombing sorties over New Britain and north-eastern New Guinea, as well as rescue and survey missions.<ref>RAAF Historical Section, ''Units of the Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 137&ndash;140</ref> In July 1945, Pentland was posted back to Mascot as CO of No.&nbsp;3 Communication Unit, serving until September.<ref>RAAF Historical Section, ''Units of the Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 121&ndash;122</ref> His achievements in New Guinea earned him the [[Air Force Cross (United Kingdom)|Air Force Cross]] (AFC), the citation being promulgated on 22&nbsp;February 1946 and concluding:<ref name="AWM"/><ref>{{LondonGazette|supp=yes|issue=37479|startpage=1076|date=22 February 1946|accessdate=10 January 2010}}</ref>

With the end of hostilities in the Pacific, Pentland was discharged from the RAAF on 2&nbsp;November 1945.<ref name="AWM"/> He took the opportunity to purchase surplus military equipment in New Guinea and established himself as a trader in [[Finschhafen]], later expanding to Lae and [[Wau]]. In 1948, he went into business as a coffee planter in [[Goroka]], and also recruited labour from the highlands for industries on the coast. Prospering as a planter, he contributed to development of the region by building Goroka's original constant-flowing water supply and encouraging other businesses to set up there. His ongoing commitments in New Guinea meant that he was not [[Investiture|invested]] with his AFC until 1950. In 1959, he sold his interests in Goroka and retired with Madge to their seaside home in [[Bayview, New South Wales|Bayview]], New South Wales.<ref name="Garrison"/><ref>Schaedel, ''Australian Air Ace'', pp. 153&ndash;157</ref> Madge Pentland died in 1982, and Jerry eighteen months later at the War Veterans Home in nearby [[Collaroy, New South Wales|Collaroy]].
