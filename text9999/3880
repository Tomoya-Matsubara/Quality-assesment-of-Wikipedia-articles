==Background and development==
Although Sebastian released the [[Compilation album|retrospective]] album ''[[Twenty Ten (album)|Twenty Ten]]'' in 2010, ''Armageddon'' is his first studio album since ''[[Like It Like That (album)|Like It Like That]]'', an album of original [[soul music]], was released in October 2009.<ref>[http://www.webcitation.org/651hQJZsb Like It Like That]. Sanity Music. Archived from [http://www.sanity.com.au/products/2131892/Like_It_Like_That the original] on 28 January 2012.</ref>  ''Armageddon'', while mainly [[Pop music|pop]] with some [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] songs, still shows the soul influences that ''Like it Like That'' did on many of the songs. Sebastian has said he grew up listening to [[old school]] soul music from artists like [[Sam Cooke]], [[Otis Redding]], [[Donny Hathaway]], and [[Stevie Wonder]], and they had always been his strongest musical influences.<ref>[http://www.webcitation.org/64sAEaj9X Guy Sebastian: From 'Australian Idol' to 'X Factor'] The Celebrity Cafe. 23 August 2010. Archived from [http://thecelebritycafe.com/interview/guy-sebastian-australian-idol-x-factor-08-23-2010 the original] on 21 January 2012.</ref> He said early in his career he was steered away from soul music, advised it wouldn't sell in Australia. After he released ''[[The Memphis Album]]'', a [[cover album]] of [[Memphis soul]] classics he recorded with members [[Booker T & The MGs|the MGs]] including [[Steve Cropper]], he realised there was a market, and he felt he could now do the style of music he had always wanted to.<ref name="Like him like that">[http://www.webcitation.org/64sLa1vZq Like him like that].

In an interview about ''Armageddon'' Sebastian spoke of how much ''The Memphis Album'' still influences his music, "I headed across to Memphis and was very inspired by the music scene there. I got to work with some people who were instrumental in shaping the careers of artists who heavily influence me. Artists like Otis Redding, [[Sam & Dave]] and Sam Cooke. Being entrenched in that sort of environment really caused me to go 'You know what dude. Do what you want to do. Do what comes natural to you'." Sebastian said it was a turning point for him, adding, "From that Memphis thing a few years ago it's always going to start with me being true to who I want to be and what I enjoy singing."<ref name="The Hype interview">[http://au.thehype.yahoo.com/video/watch/3ac347ea-f3f9-3847-9049-9ba4b97a7b6f/interview-guy-sebastian-for-armageddon/ The Hype interview: Guy Sebastian for Armageddon].Yahoo!7. Retrieved on 27 October 2012.</ref> Sebastian feels his soul roots remained even when he delved into [[Eurodance|electro dance music]] with the single "[[Who's That Girl (Guy Sebastian song)|Who's That Girl]]" from his previous album, explaining it was an old school Sam Cooke type of melody, with modern lyrics, over a dance track.<ref name="It's still all heart and soul for Sebastian">Sjostedt, Arne (14 March 2012)[http://www.webcitation.org/6BHWCBs4Z It's still all heart and soul for Sebastian] Adelaide Now.

I could have produced an old-school soul song, but I went towards what you hear on the radio."<ref name="It's a Guy Sebastian thing">Smith, Jacqueline (2 December 2010)[http://www.webcitation.org/659NNOkBF It's a Guy Sebastian thing].[[The New Zealand Herald]].

''Armageddon'' was originally slated for release mid 2012, but it was delayed because Sebastian wanted to be completely happy with it before it was released. He said, "It's the longest I have spent with an album but I'm not rushing it for a TV performance or anything. It will happen when it's ready".<ref name="Guy may give up TV for music">Adams, Cameron (14 March 2012)[http://www.webcitation.org/6BHLeh3UG Guy may give up TV for music] Adelaide Now.

I'm still learning what defines me as an artist. There's stuff in there that radio won't touch but it needs to be there and I think it lifts the album.[....] I've done most of it myself and I've really taken my time."<ref name="A different kind of Guy"/> While the album has the upbeat happy music and love songs he is known for, Sebastian said becoming a father earlier in the year brought new awareness, and he started analysing the world his son would grow up in.<ref name="Interview: Guy Sebastian">Digges, Mariam (3 September 2012)[http://www.webcitation.org/6BJLsleJQ Interview: Guy Sebastian].Mind Food.

Because of this he said the album has more light and shade, "there's definitely moments where it has a bit more depth to it -- it's not just 'I love you, do you love me too?' Obviously there's some love songs in there, but there's also a bit more commentary on the world that my little boy (Hudson) is going to inherit."<ref name="A different kind of Guy">Young,Kane (14 June 2012)[http://www.webcitation.org/6BJMYpY50 A different kind of Guy].The Mercury.

==Writing and composition==
Five of the songs on ''Armageddon'' are written by Sebastian alone, while the others have at least one co-writer. Sebastian began writing songs which appear on the album almost two years before its release, and performed two of them, "Summer Love" and "Keeper", while touring as a support act on [[Lionel Richie]]'s Australian and New Zealand tour in March 2011.<ref>[http://www.webcitation.org/6BMEDbdxg Lionel Richie Touring With Special Guest Guy Sebastian In March 2011].Guy Sebastian official site.

"Summer Love" is about bittersweet feelings for a lost love, and "Keeper" is about finding that special love, the one who is a keeper.<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4vPofK7aSI Lionel Richie Tour, Leconfield winery South Australia: Guy Sebastian - Summer Love].YouTube.

Sebastian toured nationally during June and July 2012. The 20 date tour had concerts in all capital cities and also in regional areas of New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland. Originally scheduled to promote the album after its release, the tour became a showcase for the new songs.<ref>[http://www.webcitation.org/6BQAIN5Gf Guy Sebastian 'Armageddon' Tour 2012].liveguide.com.au.

He felt it was the best tour he had done, saying "I pretty much put every cent back into the tour and really stepped up the production and the lighting, it's a lot bigger and better. I'm playing some 3000-seat venues and a bunch of them are sold out, so I want to make sure I'm not compromising. I didn't want to fall short, and it has come up great, better than I thought."<ref name="A different kind of Guy"/> 

Sebastian invited Ben Burgess, a musician friend from the US, to tour with him. He performed Fiasco's rap on "Battle Scars" and was also the support act. Due to Carmen Smith's disqualification from ''The Voice'' she was able to participate on the tour. She performed backing vocals along with [[Gary Pinto]], and also the featured parts for "[[Art of Love (Guy Sebastian song)|Art of Love]]" and "[[Who's That Girl (Guy Sebastian song)|Who's That Girl]]".<ref name="A different kind of Guy"/> Smith also performed "Armageddon" with Sebastian, as at the time he had been thinking of having a featured artist on the track.<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4LvAJcKrY0&list=UU5dinx1aVKJk8SNsLKTap_g&index=54&feature=plcp Armageddon Tour -"Armageddon" feat.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
''Armageddon'' and its singles have received a number of positive reviews. Jamie Horne, music journalist for the ''[[Border Mail]]'' gave the album four and a half out of five stars, saying, "Armageddon truly is mature pop. But do not fear <U+2014> it<U+2019>s not adult contemporary and, more importantly, it<U+2019>s nothing like the club pop that<U+2019>s been diseasing our charts. It is late, however, having been penciled in for a mid-year release. But that<U+2019>s also forgiven early with the opening duo, Amnesia and Beg, the latter a swirling mid-tempo effort destined to be a live favourite."<ref>Horne, Jamie (10 October 2012)[http://www.webcitation.org/6BOep7bJ1 CD reviews].
