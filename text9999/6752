The [[Smooth-leaved Elm]] ''U. minor'' var. ''minor'' cultivar '''Variegata Nova''' was first listed by Nicholson in ''Kew Hand-List Trees and Shrubs'', 2: 137, [[1896]], as ''U. campestris'' var. ''variegata nova'', but without description. Henry, in Elwes & Henry (1913), states that the tree bears "leaves often much reduced in size, and entirely whitish. Occasionally, branches are produced bearing leaves of normal size with variegation confined to the margin, and one or two branches with green leaves". 
The tree was considered "possibly ''U. carpinifolia" (: minor'') by Green (1964).
