The '''Allogromiida''' are a group of monothalamous (single-chambered), mostly organic-walled [[foraminifera]]ns, including some that produce agglutinated tests (Lagynacea).  Genetic studies have shown that some foraminiferans with agglutinated tests, previously included in the [[Textulariida]] or as their own order Astrorhizida, also belong here.  Allogromiids produce relatively simple tests, usually with a single chamber, similar to those of other protists such as ''[[Gromia]]''.  They are found in both marine and freshwater forms, and are the oldest forams known from the fossil record.
