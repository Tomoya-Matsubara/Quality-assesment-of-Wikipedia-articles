'''Yde (Adelaide) Schloenbach''' (later ''Blumenschein'' by marriage, born in [[S<U+00E3>o Paulo]], on May 26, 1882) is a [[Brazil]]ian poet best known as '''Colombina'''.

Poet and chronicler, she started writing at the age of 13, her first poems being published in ''A Tribuna'', newspaper of the city of [[Santos, S<U+00E3>o Paulo|Santos]]. She wrote for magazines and newspapers like ''O Malho'', ''Fon-Fon'', ''Careta'' and ''Jornal das Mo<U+00E7>as''. Besides "Colombina", she also used the pen name of "Paula Brasil".

In 1948 she founded the "Casa do Poeta Lampi<U+00E3>o de G<U+00E1>s", a literary society that initially met at her own home. This society published a monthly newspaper, "O Fanal", of which she was the publisher.

Her poetry is centered on the theme of love, usually treated in a quite innocent way, though some of her poems have a more erotic vein that caused some scandal at her time. Her last book, ''Raps<U+00F3>dia Rubra - Poemas <U+00E0> Carne'' ("Red Rapsody - Poems Dedicated to Flesh") reflects this trend, and its highly erotic poetry was particularly polemical at the time of its publishing.
