===Deep South Wrestling (2005-2006)===
Reeves started training at Deep South Wrestling, a pro wrestling school located in [[McDonough, Georgia]].

In January 2006, he formed a short-lived tag team with Ryan O'Reilly and faced Team Elite and '''[[The Shane Twins|The Gymini]]'''. Before the team could gain momentum, the WWE transferred Reeves from Deep South Wrestling, to Ohio Valley Wrestling two months later. Reeves wrestled his last match losing to Freakin Deacon on February 26, 2006.

===Ohio Valley Wrestling (2006-2007)=== 
After training in DSW for most of 2005 and early 2006, Reeves arrived in Ohio Valley Wrestling in early March. He defeated [[Kasey James]], Pat Buck, Da Beast and [[Nick Nemeth|Double N]] in [[dark match]]es during his two months and, with [[Mikey Batts]], won victories over [[Chad Wicks|Billy Kryptonite]] & Russell Simpson and Jack Bull & Vic Devine. 

On May 10, Reeves teamed with [[OVW Tag Team Championship|OVW Tag Team Champions]] Kasey James & [[Amish Roadkill|Roadkill]] to defeat [[Aaron Stevens]] & [[Deuce N' Domino]] at an OVW television taping. <ref> {{cite web |url=http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/tv_reports/40804/411%5C%5Cs-OVW-TV-Report-5.11.06.htm |title=411's OVW TV Report 5.11.06 |accessdate= |author=Sullivan, Steve |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=2006-05-11 |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=411mania.com |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }} </ref> Three days later, he and Mikey Batts lost to Kasey James & Roadkill in a title match.

In July 2006, Ryan Reeves was suspended for 30 days due to failing a drug test as part of the ''[[World Wrestling Entertainment#Wellness Program|Wellness Program]]''. <ref name="Wrestling-Radio"/> <ref> {{cite web |url=http://www.impactwrestling.com/Content.aspx?ID=18187 |title=History Of WWE Drug Suspensions, Spokesperson Comments On Regal's Violation |accessdate= |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=2008-05-21 |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=ImpactWrestling.com |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }} </ref> According to Reeves, he had been taking several [[over the counter]] [[bodybuilding supplement]]s one of which inadvertently caused a false reading.

===High Dosage===
After his previous 30 day suspension, Reeves got even bigger, as well as bleaching his hair blonde. After changing his look, Reeves returned to wrestling on a number of OVW shows including an impressive victory over Johnny Punch, Rod Steele, Ramon Loco, [[Mr. Strongko]], [[Mike Kruel]], [[Shad Gaspard]] and [[Charles Evans]] in a gauntlet match on August 19. In September 2006, Reeves began teaming with Jon Bolen, who together became known as '''High Dosage'''.  Scoring early victories against teams such as Los Locos (Aaron Lamata & Lowrider) and Johnny Punch & Pat Buck, they began feuding with the then newly formed team of Eddie Craven, Mike Kruel and "The Bad Seed" Shawn Osborne. 

The two did not fare well against the trio loosing both tag team and single matches to them during the next few weeks. On October 18, he and Bolen also lost to them in a handicap match. Things soon changed however when High Dosage beat Eddie Craven & Mike Kruel a month later. As a result of their victory, they were allowed five minutes alone with Shawn Osbourne but he was able to escape with the help of Eddie Craven & Mike Kruel. Although continuing to face their rivals throughout the year, High Dosage also won matches against Los Locos and Bad Company defeating the latter in a Handicap Coal Miner's Glove on a Pole match on November 29. On December 9, High Dosage teamed with [[Seth Skyfire]] and lost to Eddie Craven, Mike Kruel & Milena Roucka. Reeves also took part in a four-way Elimination Christmas Present match with Mike Kruel four days later. The participants included [[Justin LaRoche]] & Charles Evans, T.J. Dalton & [[Steve Lewington]] and Seth Skyfire & Paul Burchill who eventually won the match. 

On January 6, 2007, High Dosage lost to Justin LaRoche & Charles Evans. They also lost to OVW Tag Team Champions Cody Runnels & Shawn Spears four days later. This was their last match together as Reeves was officially releases from his contract less then two weeks later. <ref> {{cite web |url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2007/01/19/3407911.html |title=SLAM!
