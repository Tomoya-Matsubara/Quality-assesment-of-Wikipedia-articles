'''Roy Cecil Phillipps''', [[Military Cross|MC]] [[Medal bar|& Bar]], [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|DFC]] (1 March 1892&nbsp;<U+2013> 21&nbsp;May 1941) was an Australian [[flying ace|fighter ace]] of World War&nbsp;I. He achieved fifteen victories in aerial combat, four of them in a single action on 12&nbsp;June 1918. A [[grazier]] between the wars, he joined the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) in 1940 and was killed in a plane crash the following year.

Born in [[New South Wales]] but raised in [[Western Australia]], Phillipps joined the [[First Australian Imperial Force|Australian Imperial Force]] as an infantryman in April 1915, seeing action at [[Gallipoli campaign|Gallipoli]] and on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. Wounded twice in 1916, he transferred to the [[Australian Flying Corps]] (AFC) and, having falsified his age, was accepted for pilot training in May 1917. As a member of [[No. 2 Squadron RAAF|No.&nbsp;2 Squadron]] in France, Phillipps flew mainly [[Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5|S.E.5]] fighters, and was awarded two [[Military Cross]]es and the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] for his actions. He finished the war a [[major]], commanding [[No. 6 Squadron RAAF|No.&nbsp;6 (Training) Squadron]] in England. Returning to Australia in 1919, he left the AFC and was managing a rural property when he enlisted in the RAAF soon after the outbreak of World War&nbsp;II. At his death he was ranked [[squadron leader]], commanding No.&nbsp;2 Elementary Flying Training School at [[Archerfield, Queensland|Archerfield]], Queensland.

==Early life==
Phillipps was born on 1&nbsp;March 1892 in [[New South Wales]], though sources differ on the exact location, which is variously recorded as rural [[Moree, New South Wales|Moree]]<ref>Australian Military Forces, ''Phillipps, Roy Cecil'', p. 6</ref><ref name=AWM>{{cite web|url=http://cas.awm.gov.au/photograph/A03716|title= A03716|publisher= [[Australian War Memorial]]|accessdate=14 February 2014}}</ref> and metropolitan [[North Sydney, New South Wales|North Sydney]].<ref>Cutlack, [http://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1069815--1-.PDF ''The Australian Flying Corps'', p. 177]</ref><ref name=Newton>Newton, ''Australian Air Aces'', p. 53</ref> He was the son of William Hargreaves Phillipps, originally of [[Northumberland]], England, and his wife Cecil. After his father died, Phillipps' mother took him to live in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], Western Australia. Educated at [[Hale School]], he studied to be an accountant and was practising on a pastoral property in the [[Kimberley (Western Australia)|Kimberley]] when war broke out in 1914.<ref name=AWM/><ref name=Obit>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article47326159 |title=RAAF officer's death |newspaper=[[The West Australian]] |location=Perth|date=24 May 1941 |accessdate=18 February 2014 |page=4 |publisher=[[National Library of Australia]]}}</ref>

Phillipps enlisted in the [[First Australian Imperial Force|Australian Imperial Force]] in April 1915 and joined the [[28th Battalion (Australia)|28th Battalion]], an infantry unit raised the same month at Blackboy Camp, Western Australia. He successfully applied for a commission and departed for Egypt aboard HMAT ''Ascanius'' on 9&nbsp;June as a [[second lieutenant]].<ref name=AWM/><ref name=28Bn>{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/units/unit_11215.asp |title=28th Battalion|publisher= Australian War Memorial|accessdate= 14 February 2014}}</ref> After training in Egypt, he departed with his unit for [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]] aboard the transport ''[[SS Ivernia|Ivernia]]'' on 4&nbsp;September. He was promoted to [[lieutenant]] on 25&nbsp;October.<ref>Australian Military Forces, ''Phillipps, Roy Cecil'', p. 10</ref> The 28th Battalion, which had been sent to Gallipoli late in the campaign as reinforcements, was not heavily engaged on the peninsula, and suffered relatively few casualties before the withdrawal in December 1915.<ref name=28Bn/><ref name=Garrisson>Garrisson, ''Australian Fighter Aces'', pp. 99<U+2013>100</ref>

In March 1916, Phillipps deployed to France with the 28th Battalion for service on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. He participated in a raid against the forts of [[Armenti<U+00E8>res]] on the night of 6/7&nbsp;June, and saw action during the [[Battle of Pozi<U+00E8>res]] in July. On 5&nbsp;August, he was shot through the thigh, requiring evacuation to England for hospital treatment.<ref name=AWM/><ref name=28Bn/> He was promoted to [[Captain (armed forces)|captain]] on 12&nbsp;August.<ref name=Garrisson/> Phillipps rejoined his unit in October but suffered another gunshot wound to the thigh the following month, near [[Gueudecourt]]. He returned to England once more to recover, and remained in hospital until 2&nbsp;March 1917.<ref name=AWM/><ref>Australian Military Forces, ''Phillipps, Roy Cecil'', pp. 10<U+2013>13</ref>

===Australian Flying Corps===
Unable to take any further part in the war as an infantryman, Phillipps would normally have been repatriated to Australia, but instead engineered a transfer to the [[Australian Flying Corps]] (AFC) as [[adjutant]] of [[No. 2 Squadron RAAF|No.&nbsp;2 Squadron]].<ref name=Newton/><ref name=Franks>Franks, ''SE5/5a Aces of World War 1'', pp. 42<U+2013>43</ref> After getting a taste of flying as a passenger, the twenty-five year-old applied for pilot training, altering his birthdate from 1892 to 1896.<ref name=AWM/><ref name=Cutlack177-182>Cutlack, [http://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1069815--1-.PDF ''The Australian Flying Corps'', pp. 177<U+2013>178, 181<U+2013>182]</ref> The official age limit for pilots in the AFC was thirty, but the preferred age was under twenty-three.<ref>Molkentin, ''Fire in the Sky'', p. 30</ref> Phillipps' application was accepted in May 1917 and, after qualifying for his [[Aircrew brevet|wings]], his proficiency was considered such that in August he was attached to [[No. 32 Squadron RAF|No.&nbsp;32 Squadron]] of the [[Royal Flying Corps]] to gain operational experience in France. Within three days of arriving he crash-landed his Airco DH.5 after it was hit by [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft fire]] near [[Ypres]], but he escaped injury; by the time he completed his attachment in September he was leading combat patrols.<ref name=Newton/><ref name=Cutlack177-182/>

Phillipps married Ellen Robinson, daughter of Western Australia's [[Attorney-General of Western Australia|Attorney-General]], at [[St Mary Abbots]] in [[Kensington]], London, on 8&nbsp;September 1917.<ref name=AWM/> Rejoining No.&nbsp;2 Squadron within the month as a [[Flight (military unit)|flight commander]], he was initially engaged mainly in low-level strafing and bombing missions in DH.5s as his unit, attached to the [[Third Army (United Kingdom)|British Third Army]], took part in the [[Battle of Passchendaele]].<ref name=Franks/><ref name=2Sqn>{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/units/unit_10836.asp |title=2 Squadron AFC|publisher= Australian War Memorial|accessdate=14 February 2014}}</ref> During the subsequent [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|Battle of Cambrai]], on 22&nbsp;November, he recorded his first aerial victory when he turned the tables on a German fighter that had attacked him from above, forcing it to land.<ref name=Garrisson/><ref>Cutlack, [http://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1069816--1-.PDF ''The Australian Flying Corps'', pp. 183<U+2013>184, 190]</ref> He was recommended for the [[Military Cross]] on 3&nbsp;December,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1068780--10-.PDF |title=Recommendation: Military Cross|publisher= Australian War Memorial|accessdate= 14 February 2014}}</ref> the award being promulgated in ''[[The London Gazette]]'' on 4&nbsp;February 1918,<ref>{{LondonGazette|supp=yes|issue=30507|startpage=1606|date=4 February 1918 |accessdate=14 February 2014}}</ref> and the full citation appearing on 5&nbsp;July:<ref>{{LondonGazette|supp=yes|issue=30780|startpage=7937|date=5 July 1918 |accessdate=14 February 2014}}</ref>

{{quote|Capt. Roy Cecil Phillipps, F.C.

For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty. He has performed continuous gallant work at very low altitudes in almost impossible weather. Whilst flying alone in a mist he forced an enemy aeroplane to land. On two occasions, flying at an altitude of 200 feet, he made very valuable reconnaissances, and his reports on the general situation were of the greatest value. His leadership is excellent, and he has set a high example to his flight.}}

No. 2 Squadron converted to [[Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5]]s in January 1918.<ref name=Franks/> The unit generally conducted patrols with flights of six aircraft but found it difficult to lure enemy fighters into combat, so after a lull in fighting early in February it began flying two-plane missions, which yielded better results.<ref>Molkentin, ''Fire in the Sky'', p. 232</ref> The following month, as the German [[Spring Offensive]] got under way, Phillipps shot down three German fighters in as many days: a [[Fokker Dr.I|Fokker Triplane]] on 22&nbsp;March, an [[Albatros Flugzeugwerke|Albatros]] the next morning, and a two-seater on 24&nbsp;March; the [[Official History of Australia in the War of 1914<U+2013>1918|official history of Australia in the war]] recorded that the last-mentioned enemy lost its wings to Phillipps' machine-gun fire, and "fell like a stone". With the Allies holding clear superiority over the German fighters, the main danger to the Australians was from ground fire as most combat took place at low level, and "their machines came back full of bullet-holes".<ref>Cutlack, [http://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1069818--1-.PDF ''The Australian Flying Corps'', pp. 228<U+2013>230, 235]</ref> On 27&nbsp;March, Phillipps achieved two more victories, a Triplane that he sent down in flames near [[Albert, Somme|Albert]] and another German fighter over [[M<U+00E9>aulte]].<ref>Cutlack, [http://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1069818--1-.PDF ''The Australian Flying Corps'', p. 240]</ref> He was recommended for a [[Medal bar|bar]] to his Military Cross on 31&nbsp;March,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1068780--11-.PDF |title=Recommendation: Bar to Military Cross|publisher= Australian War Memorial|accessdate= 14 February 2014}}</ref> and the award was gazetted on 22&nbsp;June:<ref>{{LondonGazette|supp=yes|issue=30761|startpage=7402|date=22 June 1918 |accessdate=14 February 2014}}</ref>

For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty. When engaged with hostile aircraft during the recent operations, he has destroyed three enemy machines, and has in addition brought down two hostile planes out of control. He has also brought back accurate and valuable information regarding hostile movements under the most adverse conditions, particularly on one occasion, when he flew through a heavy barrage at a low altitude behind the enemy's lines. He has shown conspicuous skill and determination when escorting low-flying bombing patrols.}}

During April 1918, No.&nbsp;2 Squadron began operating in wide-ranging offensive "circus" patrols made up of large formations of fighters, often drawn from several squadrons.<ref>Cutlack, [http://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1069819--1-.PDF ''The Australian Flying Corps'', pp. 247<U+2013>248]</ref> Phillipps destroyed a [[Pfalz Flugzeugwerke|Pfalz]] near [[Bapaume]] on 16&nbsp;May, before achieving his greatest success on 12&nbsp;June when he shot down four German fighters in a single patrol over [[Rib<U+00E9>court-la-Tour|Rib<U+00E9>court]].<ref name=Franks/><ref>Cutlack, [http://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1069819--1-.PDF ''The Australian Flying Corps'', pp. 255<U+2013>259]</ref> His victims included two Fokker Triplanes, one of which he attacked head-on, an [[LVG]], and a [[Fokker D.VII]] flown by Fritz Loerzer, commander of [[Jagdstaffel 26|''Jasta'' 26]] and an eleven-victory ace, who was captured.<ref name=Newton/><ref>Franks, ''Albatros Aces of World War 1'', pp. 52<U+2013>53</ref> The feat also gave Phillipps a total of eleven victories, making him the equal highest-scoring ace in No.&nbsp;2 Squadron along with Captain [[Henry Garnet Forrest|Henry Forrest]].<ref>Molkentin, ''Fire in the Sky'', p. 262</ref> Phillipps was recommended for the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] on 16&nbsp;June,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1068778--11-.PDF|title= Recommendation: Distinguished Flying Cross|publisher= Australian War Memorial|accessdate= 14 February 2014}}</ref> and the award was promulgated on 3&nbsp;August:<ref>{{LondonGazette|supp=yes|issue=30827|startpage=9202|date=3 August 1918 |accessdate=14 February 2014}}</ref>

Whilst on offensive patrol this officer destroyed personally four enemy aeroplanes; he has also shown the greatest gallantry during the recent operations in attacking troops and transports on the roads, and dropping bombs from very low altitudes.}}

On 25&nbsp;July, Phillipps was leading the escort for a raid on the Lille forts east of Armenti<U+00E8>res when he spotted a patrol of seven Fokkers.
