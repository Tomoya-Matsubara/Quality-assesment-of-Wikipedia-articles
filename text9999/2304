'''Eccles''' (pop. 36,600) is a town in the [[City of Salford]], a [[metropolitan borough]] of [[Greater Manchester]] in [[North West England]], {{convert|2.7|mi|km|1}} west of [[Salford]] and {{convert|3.7|mi|km|1}} west of [[Manchester city centre]].<ref>{{Citation |url=http://www.gmcro.co.uk/guides/gazette/gazframe.htm|date=2003-07-31|title=A select gazetteer of local government areas, Greater Manchester County|publisher=[[Greater Manchester County Record Office]]|accessdate=2008-05-02}}</ref> [[Historic counties of England|Historically]] a part of [[Lancashire]], Eccles lies on sloping ground between the [[M602 motorway]] (to the north), and the [[Manchester Ship Canal]] (to the south).

Evidence of pre-historic human settlement has been discovered locally, but the present town grew up around the 13th-century [[Church of St Mary the Virgin, Eccles|Parish Church of St Mary]]. The area was predominantly agricultural until the [[Industrial Revolution]], when a textile industry was established in the town. The arrival of the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]], the world's first passenger railway, led to the town's expansion along the route of the track linking those two cities; as of 2009 Salford City Council is bidding for the railway to be included in the [[UNESCO]] list of [[World Heritage Site]]s. Eccles was not immune to the general 20th-century decline of the United Kingdom's textile industry. Parts of the town are among the worst 20% in the UK for child poverty, and the unemployment rate is slightly above the national average. The town's present-day landscape is dominated by residential tower blocks, forming a stark contrast with the surrounding [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] terraced housing.

[[Eccles Cake]]s, made from flaky pastry, butter, nutmeg, candied peel, sugar and currants, were first produced and sold in the town in 1793, and are now exported across the world. Eccles' other claim to fame is its involvement in one of the world's first railway accidents when in 1830 [[William Huskisson]], the [[Member of Parliament]] for Liverpool, was seriously injured by an approaching [[locomotive]]. He was taken to the vicarage in Eccles for treatment, but died of his injuries.

==History==
===Toponymy===
No definitive proof of the derivation of the name survives, but several theories exist to explain the modern name "Eccles".  One is that the eccles place<U+2013>name is derived from the [[Romano-British]] "Ecles" or "Eglys", itself derived from the Latin "[[Ecclesia]]".<ref name="Kenyonpp9596">{{Harvnb|Kenyon|1991|pp=95&ndash;96.}}</ref>  Following the arrival in AD&nbsp;613 of the invading [[Anglo-Saxons]] at Lancashire, many existing British place<U+2013>names, especially rivers and hills (the [[River Irwell]] for example), survived intact.  The root "Ecles", found in several village names, is an exception to this.  A popular theory is that the word denoted the site of a building recognised by the Anglo-Saxons as a church and feature of the landscape.  Eccles appears to have been such a village, and "Ecles" may be the likely source of the modern name.<ref name="Johnstonpp14">{{Harvnb|Johnston|1962|pp=1&ndash;4}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Gelling|Nicolaisen|Richards|1970|p=88.}}</ref>  In Kenyon's ''"Origins of Lancashire"'' (1991) however the author suggests that this may not be the case as there is not an exact correlation between eccles place<U+2013>names and pre-''[[Domesday Book|Domesday]]'' [[Hundred (country subdivision)|hundred]]s in south Lancashire.<ref name="Kenyonpp9596"/>  The derivation of the name of the area therefore remains unclear.

===Early history===
Pre-historic finds in the parish of Eccles include [[Dugout (boat)|dugout boats]] found at [[Barton-upon-Irwell]], an individual example of an [[Arrowhead (stone age)|arrowhead]], a [[spear]], and [[axe]]s at Winton.  These finds would appear to suggest the existence of a hunting and travelling society.  Human existence in the area may extend as far back as 6000&nbsp;BC, and there may have been two separate periods of settlement on [[Chat Moss]], around 500&nbsp;BC and also during the [[Romano-British]] period.<ref>{{Harvnb|Johnston|1967|pp=7&ndash;8.}}</ref>

<!--Romans here-->
The village may have been founded by refugees from Manchester (''[[Mamucium]]'') during the [[Diocletianic Persecution]] in the early 4th century,<ref name="Johnstonpp14"/> although excavations in 2001<U+2013>2005 revealed that the civilian settlement at Manchester had probably been abandoned by the mid-3rd century.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gregory|2007|p=190.}}</ref>  Throughout the [[Dark Ages]] the parish appears to have been remote enough to be untouched by any local conflicts, while absorbing successive waves of immigrants from nearby towns.<ref>{{Harvnb|Johnston|1967|p=14.}}</ref>

The [[Manorialism|Manor]] of Barton-upon-Irwell once covered a large area; in 1276 it included townships such as Asphull, Halghton, Halliwelle, Farnword, Eccles, Workedele, Withington (latterly Winton), Irwelham, Hulm, Quicklewicke, Suynhul, and Swinton.  Before this date it would appear to have been even larger, but by 1320 the manor boundaries were described as "Tordhale Siche descending to Caldebroc, then to the pit near Preste Platteforde and then to another pit, then to the ditch of Roger the Clerk, then to the hedge of Richard the Rimeur, then following the hedge to Caldebroc."<ref>{{Harvnb|Johnston|1967|p=30.}}</ref>  The manor was originally controlled by the Barton family until about 1292 when by marriage it came into the ownership of the Booth family, who retained it for almost 300&nbsp;years.  In 1586 the Trafford family assumed control of the manor, and established themselves in 1632 at Whittleswick, which was renamed [[Trafford Park]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Johnston|1967|pp=32&ndash;34.}}</ref>

The<!-- medieval? --> parish of Eccles contained the townships of Barton-upon-Irwell, Clifton, Pendlebury, Pendleton, and Worsley.<ref>{{Harvnb|Harland|1857|p=589.}}</ref>  Toward the end of the [[Middle Ages]] the parish had an estimated population of about 4,000&nbsp;[[Eucharist|Communicants]].  Agriculture remained an important local industry, with little change from the [[Medieval]] system due to a lack of adequate drainage and fertiliser.<ref>{{Harvnb|Johnston|1967|pp=56&ndash;57.}}</ref>  No evidence exists to demonstrate the layout of the area, but it would likely have been the same as the surrounding areas of Salford, [[Urmston]] and [[Warrington]] where [[oats]] and [[barley]] would have been grown.<ref>{{Harvnb|Johnston|1967|p=37.}}</ref>  Local [[Cottage_industry#Cottage_industry|cottage industries]] included [[blacksmith]]s, [[butcher]]s, [[thatching]], [[basket weaving]], [[skinning]], and [[tanning]].  [[Weaving]] was popular, using linen and wool.  [[Merchant]]s traded in corn, and [[Badger (person)|badgers]] bought and sold local produce.<ref>{{Harvnb|Johnston|1967|pp=59&ndash;60.}}</ref>

Although the local [[gentry]] supported the [[Cavalier|Royalists]], the [[English Civil War]] had little effect on the area.  Troops would occasionally pass through the parish<ref name="Johnstonpp6364">{{Harvnb|Johnston|1967|pp=63&ndash;64.}}</ref> and there was a skirmish at Woolden,<ref name="Farrerpp352362">{{Harvnb|Farrer|Brownbill|1911|pp=352&ndash;362.}}</ref> but the only other mention of local involvement was the burial of two (probably) local soldiers in 1643.<ref name="Johnstonpp6364"/>  The [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] army passed through in 1745, in its advance and subsequent retreat.<ref name="Farrerpp352362"/>

===Textiles and the Industrial revolution===
[[File:James nasmyth.jpg|right|thumb|upright|A [[calotype]] of [[James Nasmyth]], pictured c.&nbsp;1844]]
In 1795 [[John Aikin]] described the area:
<blockquote>The agriculture of the parish is chiefly confined to grazing, and would be more materially benefited by draining; but the tax upon brick, a most essential article in this process, has been a very great hindrance to it. The use of lime<U+2014>imported from Wales, and brought by the inland navigations to the neighbourhood of our collieries<U+2014>has become very general in the improvement of the meadow and pasture lands.<ref name="Farrerpp352362"/></blockquote>

During the 18th century the predominance of [[Textiles]] in the region is partly demonstrated in the [[parish registers]] of 1807, which show that 46&nbsp;children were baptised with 34&nbsp;fathers employed as [[weaver]]s.<ref>{{Harvnb|Johnston|1967|p=84.}}</ref>  In ''Memoirs of seventy years of an eventful life'' (1852) Charles Hulbert wrote:

<blockquote>The principal employment of the working population of Eccles and vicinity at that time, was the manufacture of Cotton Goods on the home or domestic plan.  These were not then, according to my present recollection, more than two Spinning Manufactories in Manchester, Arkwright's with its loft chimney, and Douglas's extensive Works, on the river Irwell, near the Broken bank&nbsp;... At the period of my first residence in Eccles Parish, I believe the above Mills chiefly supplied the Weavers of Eccles and other parishes with twist for warps, which were purchased by the Master Manufacturers.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hulbert|1852|p=86.}}</ref></blockquote>

[[File:Bridgewater foundary.gif|left|thumb|A contemporary view of Nasmyth's [[Bridgewater Foundry]] in [[Patricroft]].  The [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]] can be seen to the south of the building as it crosses the [[Bridgewater Canal]].]]
During the early 19th century the growth of industry meant the majority of the area's inhabitants were employed in textiles or trade, while a minority worked in agriculture.  The [[factory system]] was also introduced; in 1835 1,124&nbsp;people were employed in cotton mills, and two mills used [[power loom]]s.  Local hand-produced specialities included striped [[cotton]], Ticks, Checks, [[Nankeen]]s, and Camrays.  Two cotton mills are visible on the 1845 [[Ordnance Survey]] map of the area.  The area also became renowned for its production of [[silk]], with two mills at Eccles and one at Patricroft.  Many factory workers were children under 12&nbsp;years of age.<ref>{{Harvnb|Johnston|1967|pp=84&ndash;88.}}</ref>

In 1830 [[James Nasmyth]] (son of [[Alexander Nasmyth]]) visited the newly opened [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]], and on his return to Manchester noted the suitability of a site alongside the canal at [[Patricroft]] for an engineering works.<ref name="Jacksonpp526527"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Johnston|1967|p=89.}}</ref>  He and his brother leased the land from [[Thomas de Trafford]], and established the [[Nasmyth, Gaskell and Company|Bridgewater Foundry]] in 1836.  The foundry was completed the following year with a design based upon [[assembly line]] production.  In 1839 Nasmyth invented the [[Steam Hammer]] which enabled the manufacture of forgings at a scale and speed not seen before.  In the same year the foundry started to manufacture railway [[locomotive]]s, with&nbsp;109 built by 1853.  Nasmyth died a wealthy man in 1890.<ref>{{Harvnb|Tucker|1977|pp=177&ndash;181.}}</ref>

The Eccles Spinning and Manufacturing Company came into being following a meeting called by the Mayor of Eccles, in which concern was expressed at the decline in local industry.  Two earlier Eccles mills had been destroyed by fire, resulting in significant local unemployment.  Designed by Potts, Son and Hennings of Manchester, Bolton and Oldham, it was opened in 1906.  The imposing mill contained a multi-storey spinning mill, engine house and extensive weaving sheds.<ref name="GUSwarehouse">{{Citation | title = Addition of the former GUS warehouse, Worsley Road, Eccles, to the council's list of buildings of local architectural or historic interest | url = http://services.salford.gov.uk/solar_documents/PLMB010408C.DOC | format = DOC | publisher = salford.gov.uk | accessdate = 2009-02-16 }}</ref>

Early housing in the village consisted of groups of [[Thatching|thatched]] [[cottage]]s clustered around and near the Parish church.  The influx of workers from areas around the village accompanied an increased demand for extra housing.  Even after the establishment of the Local Board of Health new properties were often built in the gardens of existing dwellings, leading to severe overcrowding.  In 1852 the streets were paved with boulders, sewerage was non-existent, and water supply was a local [[Water well|well]].  During the latter half of the 19th century new housing was erected alongside the railway, and large areas of open land were soon occupied with new housing estates built for the area's more wealthy residents.<ref>{{Harvnb|Johnston|1967|pp=102&ndash;105}}</ref>

The construction of the [[Manchester Ship Canal]] provided many local residents with jobs.  1,888&nbsp;people were employed on the section of the new canal at Barton.  A stone aqueduct over the River Iwell dating from 1761 and designed by [[James Brindley]] was demolished and replaced by a new moveable aqueduct: the [[Barton Swing Aqueduct]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Johnston|1967|p=141.}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Nevell|1997|p=135.}}</ref>

===Post-industrial history===
Eccles was not immune to the general decline of the textile industry in the 20th century.  The Bridgewater Foundry ceased operations in 1940, taken over by the [[Ministry of Supply]] and converted into a [[ROF Patricroft|Royal Ordnance Factory]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Cantrell|2005|p=107.}}</ref>  The factory closed in the late 1980s, and is now part of the Nasymth Business Centre.

Eccles is included in the City of Salford's Unitary Development Plan 2004&ndash;2016 as part of the Western Gateway, a major focus for economic development during the plan period. Areas to be developed include the Barton Strategic Regional Site, Dock 9 at Salford Quays, [[Weaste]] Quarry near Eccles, and remaining land at Northbank, and the plan provides for improvements which include the [[A57 road|A57]] <U+2013> Trafford Park link at Barton and provisional support for a further expansion of the [[Manchester Metrolink|Metrolink]] system through the area and a link between the A57 and [[M62 motorway|M62]] at Barton.<ref>{{Citation | title = City of Salford Unitary Development Plan 2004 - 2016 chapter 189 | url = http://services.salford.gov.uk/udp/chapter_189.html | publisher = Salford City Council | accessdate = 2009-03-10}}</ref>  Under this plan the town's retail environment would also be maintained and enhanced.<ref>{{Citation | title = City of Salford Unitary Development Plan 2004 - 2016 chapter 190 | url = http://services.salford.gov.uk/udp/chapter_190.html | publisher = Salford City Council | accessdate = 2009-03-10}}</ref>

==Governance==
[[File:Eccles Municipal Borough Council.jpg|thumb|left|The [[coat of arms]] of the former Eccles Municipal Borough Council.]]
In 1854 the Barton, Eccles, Winton and Monton [[Local Board of Health]] was established for the northern part of the township of [[Barton-upon-Irwell|Barton]].  Eccles was incorporated as a [[municipal borough]] in 1892, part of which was in Barton [[poor law union]], an inter-parish unit established to provide [[social security]], and in 1933 this was expanded to include most of Barton Moss civil parish, and part of [[Worsley]] Urban District.  A small part of the borough was transferred in 1961 to the [[County Borough of Salford]].  In 1974 the borough was abolished and its area transferred to [[Greater Manchester]] to form part of the [[City of Salford]].<ref name="GM Gazetteer">{{citation |url=http://www.gmcro.co.uk/guides/gazette/gazframe.htm |title=A select gazetteer of local government areas, Greater Manchester County - select 'D to F' then 'Eccles'|publisher=[[Greater Manchester County Record Office]]|accessdate=2009-02-13|date=2003-07-31}}</ref>

Following its review of parliamentary representation in [[Greater Manchester]], the [[Boundary Commission for England]] recommended that Eccles be split between two new constituencies; [[Salford and Eccles (UK Parliament constituency)|Salford and Eccles]], from the existing [[Salford (UK Parliament constituency)|Salford]] constituency and the central/eastern part of Eccles, and [[Worsley and Eccles South (UK Parliament constituency)|Worsley and Eccles South]], from the existing [[Worsley (UK Parliament constituency)|Worsley]] constituency and the southern/western part of Eccles.<ref>{{Citation | title = Final Recommendations for Parliamentary Constituency Boundaries in Greater Manchester | work = Boundary Commission for England (North West) | publisher = Government News Network | date = 2006-07-19 | url = http://www.gnn.gov.uk/content/detail.asp?NewsAreaID=2&ReleaseID=215255| accessdate = 2007-04-05}}</ref>

Eccles is the ninth most densely populated ward in Salford, and has the highest number and proportion of people aged 75&nbsp;and over of all wards in Salford.  Levels of crime are below the average for the city.  The adult population tends to be more qualified than the city average, and primary and secondary education results are also slightly higher than average for Salford.  Unemployment is below average, with people tending to work longer hours.  More residents live in purpose-built and converted flats than do in the city as a whole, with a minority occupying [[Single-family detached home|detached]] houses or [[bungalow]]s.  Between 1994&nbsp;and&nbsp;2004,  367&nbsp;homes were added to the ward, above the average for Salford.<ref name="Eccleswardprofile">{{Citation | title = City of Salford: Eccles ward profile | url = http://www.salford.gov.uk/living/planning/planning-research/salfordwardprofiles.htm | publisher = Salford City Council | year = 2004 | accessdate = 2009-02-15 }}</ref>

Neighbouring Winton is the sixth most densely populated ward in the region and in 2001 had proportionally more children than the city as a whole.  Crime is generally below average, with falling rates of burglary in 2005.  Education standards for both adults and children are below city average with minor improvements to [[GCSE]] results between 2005 and 2006.  Unemployment is higher than average for Salford, with areas of severe income deprivation both to the north and south of the ward.

To the south, the ward of Barton is the third most densely populated in Salford with little population change between 1991&nbsp;and&nbsp;2001.  It has proportionally more over-85 year olds than the city as a whole, with low adult and primary school education standards, but significant improvements in GCSE results of late.  Some parts of Barton are amongst the worst&nbsp;20% of areas in the country for child poverty, with below city-average childcare provision.  Unemployment is higher than average for Salford.  Almost half the homes in the ward are [[Terraced house|terraced]] housing, with an extra 300 properties built between 1994&nbsp;and&nbsp;2004.<ref name="Bartonwardprofile">{{Citation | title = City of Salford: Barton ward profile | url = http://www.salford.gov.uk/living/planning/planning-research/salfordwardprofiles.htm | publisher = Salford City Council | year = 2004 | accessdate = 2009-02-15 }}</ref>

==Transport==
[[File:Opening Liverpool and Manchester Railway.jpg|thumb|right|A painting of the inaugural journey of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, by A. B. Clayton]]
The Salford to Warrington turnpike trust was formed in 1752 and assumed control of the road from Pendleton to Irlam.  Opinions as to the quality of the road were mainly negative; writing in 1795, [[John Aikin]] said "Much Labour and a very great expense of money have been expended on the roads of this parish, but they still remain in a very indifferent state, and from one plain and obvious cause, the immoderate weights drawn in carts and waggons."<ref name="Johnstonpp7274">{{Harvnb|Johnston|1967|pp=72&ndash;74.}}</ref>  On the poor quality roads, the Liverpool to Manchester [[stagecoach]] took almost an entire day to make the journey.  Matters appear to have improved by the 19th century, along with the opening of several more trust roads throughout the parish.  In the early part of the 19th century some existing routes were widened and straightened, including the modern-day Regent Road in Salford.  All the roads except one were surfaced with boulders.<ref name="Johnstonpp7274"/>  In 1832 a daily [[omnibus]] service from Manchester reached Eccles and Pendleton.  In 1877, following the laying of tracks in the road, horse-drawn trams were used; these eventually gave way in 1902 to electric trams under the control of the Salford Corporation. Motorised buses were introduced in 1938.<ref name="Johnstonpp7274"/>

[[File:Eccles railway station greater manchester.png|left|thumb|Eccles Railway Station]]
The opening of the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]] on 15&nbsp;September 1830 was a pivotal moment in transport history.  The world's first railway constructed to carry passengers as well as freight, it signalled the beginning of the end for both the turnpike trusts and the canal system.  Stagecoach services ceased as passengers started to use the faster railway.<ref name="Jacksonpp526527">{{Harvnb|Jackson|1962|pp=526&ndash;527.}}</ref>  The opening day was historic for more than one reason though; Eccles became a part of an early railway accident.  During a stop at [[Parkside railway station]] near [[Newton-le-Willows]], [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Liverpool]] [[William Huskisson]] was seriously injured by an approaching [[locomotive]].  He was taken to the vicarage in Eccles for treatment, but died of his injuries.<ref>{{Harvnb|Brockbank|1965|pp=2&ndash;3.}}</ref>  There have been two further serious railway incidents in Eccles, the first in [[Eccles rail crash (1941)|1941]],<ref>{{Citation | last = Wilson | first = Major G R S | title = Accident Report | year = 1942 | date = 9 April 1942 | publisher = Ministry of War Transport | url = http://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/documents/MoT_Eccles1941.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2008-11-12}}</ref> and the second in [[Eccles rail crash (1984)|1984]].<ref>{{Citation | title = Accident Enquiry Report | url = http://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/documents/DoT_Eccles1984.pdf | date = 1985-06-10 | publisher = HMSO | accessdate = 2009-02-26}}</ref>

The Tyldesley Loopline was opened by the [[London and North Western Railway]] on 1 September 1864 with stations at Monton Green (opened 1887), Worsley, Tyldesley, and Leigh.  The railway provided a link between Eccles (located on the existing Liverpool and Manchester line), and Wigan.  In 1870 an additional branch line from this, the Roe Green Loopline, was opened to Bolton to support the surrounding collieries, the largest of which was at Mosley Common.<ref name="subbritmonton"/>  The London and North Western Railway also built a line from [[Patricroft railway station]] to [[Molyneux Junction]], via [[Clifton Hall Tunnel]] (built in 1849).<ref name="Collacott">{{Harvnb|Collacott|1985|p=8.}}</ref>  The line connected with the [[East Lancashire Railway 1844<U+2013>1859|East Lancashire Railway]] to [[Radcliffe, Greater Manchester|Radcliffe]] and [[Bury]].

In 1851 the Earl of Ellesmere hosted [[Royal visits to Manchester and Salford during the reign of Queen Victoria|a visit to Manchester]] by [[Queen Victoria]] and [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]].  They stayed at Worsley Hall, with a view of the canal, and were given a trip between [[Patricroft railway station]] and Worsley Hall, on state barges.  Large crowds had gathered to cheer the royal party, which apparently frightened the horses drawing the barge so much that they fell into the canal.<ref>{{Harvnb|Corbett|1974|p=43.}}</ref>

The [[M602 motorway]] was opened throughout on 3 November 1971.  The Borough Council had previously formed the Eccles Borough Council<U+2019>s General Purposes Committee, which from December 1962 began to purchase land for the route of the new road, while overseeing a powerful public relations scheme.  A demolition programme commenced in January 1967, with some residents re-housed in newly-built housing stock.  The council also had to arrange for the purchase of land at the interchange with the present-day [[M60 motorway|M60]], and to re-route part of the [[Thirlmere Aqueduct]].  Construction began on 8 December 1969, along a route limited by the existence of housing estates, the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, the M62 junction at Worsley, and the Bridgewater Canal.  Consideration was given to the route of the disused Eccles-Tyldesley-Wigan railway line; the height of the motorway was lowered to accommodate a new railway bridge in case the line was ever re-instated.  The nearby bridge for the Clifton Junction branch railway was demolished with explosives.<ref>{{Citation | title = History of the M602 | url = http://www.lancashire.gov.uk/environment/historichighways/m602.asp | publisher = lancashire.gov.uk | last = Johnson | first = W.

==Religion==
As the population of Eccles increased during the Industrial Revolution the medieval parish of Eccles was gradually divided into smaller parishes, and surrounding townships gained their own churches.  The Grade II listed St Andrew's church in St Andrew's Parish was built in the 1870s and opened in 1879 (the tower was added in 1889).  Over the next 40 years various decorative improvements were made to the building, including stone carvings, stained glass, and wall paintings (covered in 1965).  Four months after the church was consecrated a church school was opened, the forerunner of the present St Andrew's Primary School.  A second school in Monton (then part of the parish) opened in 1881.  In 1912 Monton became a separate parish with its own church, St Paul's.<ref>{{Citation | title = A brief history of St Andrew's | url = http://fp.tezcat.f9.co.uk/st-andrews/history_inbrief.htm | publisher = standrewseccles.org | year = 2000 | accessdate = 2009-02-25}}</ref>
