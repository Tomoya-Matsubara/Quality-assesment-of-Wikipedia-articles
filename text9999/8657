:''Another [[as-Salih Ismail]] was an [[Ayyubid]] ruler in the 13th century.''

'''As-Salih Ismail al-Malik''' (1163-1181) was the son of [[Nur ad-Din]], and was only eleven years old when his father died in 1174. As-Salih came under the protection of the [[eunuch]] Gumushtugin and was taken to [[Aleppo]], while Nur ad-Din's officers competed for supremacy. In [[Egypt]], [[Saladin]] recognized as-Salih as his lord, although he in fact was eager to unite Egypt and [[Syria]] under his own personal rule. Saladin entered [[Damascus]] in 1174 and declared himself to be the true regent for as-Salih, and in 1176 he defeated the [[Zengid dynasty|Zengids]] outside the city, married Nur ad-Din's widow, and was recognized as ruler of Syria. As-Salih died in 1181.

According to crusader legend, his mother was the sister of [[Bertrand of Toulouse]], who had been captured by Nur ad-Din in the aftermath of the [[Second Crusade]]; a similar legend existed concerning the mother of [[Zengi]], as-Salih's grandfather.
