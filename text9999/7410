==College career (2003<U+2013>2006)==

===Freshman and sophomore seasons===
In February 2003 on [[National Signing Day]], Russell committed to [[Louisiana State University]] (LSU) over [[Florida State University]], becoming the [[LSU Tigers football|LSU Tigers]]' 28th and final recruit of the 2003 season. He [[Redshirt (college sports)|redshirted]] his freshman year and by the fall of the [[2005 NCAA Division I-A football season|2005 season]], Russell was the starting quarterback. He led the Tigers to a 10<U+2013>1 regular season record, the [[Southeastern Conference]] (SEC) Western Division title, and a top five ranking going into the [[SEC Championship Game]]. He also improved statistically, completing 60 percent of his passes for 2,443 yards and 15 touchdowns. Russell received an honorable mention on the [[Associated Press|AP]]'s All-[[Southeastern Conference|SEC]] Team.

Russell led the Tigers to two come-from-behind wins in the regular season. The first came on a 39 yard pass to [[Early Doucet]] on 4th down in the final minute of the game, as the Tigers defeated [[Arizona State University|Arizona State]] 35<U+2013>31. Later in the season, LSU defeated a then-undefeated [[University of Alabama|Alabama]] team 16<U+2013>13 when Russell completed a 14 yard touchdown to [[Dwayne Bowe]] in overtime.

Russell injured his shoulder in a loss to [[University of Georgia|Georgia]] in the [[SEC Championship Game]], and missed the team's bowl game. Backup quarterback [[Matt Flynn (football)|Matt Flynn]] replaced Russell for the [[Peach Bowl]] against [[University of Miami|Miami]], and the Tigers won the game 40<U+2013>3.

===Junior season===
Russell was the starting quarterback again at LSU in 2006, beating out [[Matt Flynn]] and highly touted redshirt freshman [[Ryan Perrilloux]]. Before the season began, he changed his jersey number from 4 to 2. He had a productive 2006 regular season, leading the Tigers to a 10<U+2013>2 record and a [[Bowl Championship Series|BCS]] [[Sugar Bowl]] berth. He threw for 3,129 yards, 28 touchdowns and eight interceptions. He was second in the SEC with 2,923 yards from scrimmage. Russell also won the SEC Offensive Player of the Week award three times during the regular season.

During one game against [[University of Tennessee|Tennessee]], Russell started the game poorly, throwing three interceptions (including one that was returned for a touchdown), but subsequently led LSU on a 15-play, 80-yard comeback drive in the end the game. At the end of the drive, Russel threw a touchdown pass to [[Early Doucet]] while there was less than 10 seconds left. As a result, LSU won 28<U+2013>24. In the [[Allstate]] [[Sugar Bowl]], Russell accumulated over 350 yards of passing and rushing combined and scored three touchdowns, leading LSU to a 41<U+2013>14 win over [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame]]. For his performance, he was named Sugar Bowl MVP.

At the end of the 2006 season, Russell was named to the all-SEC first team, ahead of [[University of Kentucky|Kentucky's]] [[Andre Woodson]] and [[University of Florida|Florida's]] [[Chris Leak]]. In addition, he was named an honorable mention All-American by ''[[Sports Illustrated]]''.

On January 10, 2007, Russell stated that he had decided to skip his final season of NCAA eligibility to enter the [[2007 NFL Draft]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Glenn |last=Guilbeau |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=LSU's JaMarcus Russell is going pro |url=http://www.shreveporttimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070111/SPORTS0202/701110319/1028 |work= [[The Times (Shreveport)|The Shreveport Times]] |publisher= |date=January 11, 2007 |accessdate= }}</ref>

John Clayton of ESPN stated that Russell's workouts at the 2007 NFL Combine that Russell's arm strength and size impressed several teams, and predicted that it would "be hard to pass up on Russell at #1."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/draft07/columns/story?columnist=clayton_john&id=2777414 |title=Russell makes a big impression <U+2013> NFL <U+2013> ESPN |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=2007-02-26 |accessdate=2010-09-16}}</ref> At the combine, Russell stated about his size, "I've been playing quarterback ever since. I was always bigger and taller than the other kids, and I was always able to throw it a pretty good length of the field." [[Cleveland Browns]] General Manager [[Phil Savage]] said of Russell's abilities, "His talent is substantial. He's a rare combination of size and arm strength."

Russell was selected by the [[Oakland Raiders]] as the [[List of NFL first overall draft choices|number one overall pick]].

Russell was one of four LSU players taken in the first round, along with [[safety (American football position)|safety]] [[LaRon Landry]], and [[wide receiver]]s
[[Dwayne Bowe]] and [[Buster Davis (wide receiver)|Craig Davis]].<ref>{{cite news

====2007 season====
After failing to reach a contract agreement with the Raiders, Russell held out through [[National Football League Training Camp|training camp]] and into the first week of the [[2007 NFL season]], until September 12, when he signed a six-year contract worth up to $68 million, with $31.5 million guaranteed.<ref>{{cite news

Raiders head coach [[Lane Kiffin]] did not immediately name Russell a starter, saying, "That way we can really control what he is doing, play for this set amount of time for this many plays. He doesn't have to have everything mastered," noting that Russell had missed all of training camp and other quarterbacks, like [[David Carr]], should have been brought along more slowly.<ref>{{cite news

On December 23, 2007 against the [[Jacksonville Jaguars]], Russell threw his first career touchdown pass, a 2-yard pass to [[Zach Miller]].

Russell made his first career start in the final game of the season against the [[San Diego Chargers]]. Russell was intercepted twice and lost a fumble, which led to 17 points off turnovers for the Chargers. After throwing his second interception, Russell did not initially get up off the field due to an injury, and he was taken to the locker room on a cart later in the game, after which he was replaced by [[Andrew Walter]]. In that first start, Russell completed 23 of 31 passes for 224 yards, one touchdown, two interceptions, and a lost fumble.<ref>{{cite news

Russell was named the starter for the opening game of the 2008 season, which was against division rival, [[2008 Denver Broncos season|Denver Broncos]]. Despite losing 41<U+2013>14 in his second career start, Russell completed over 65 percent of his passes, throwing for 180 yards, two touchdowns, and no interceptions.<ref>[http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter?game_id=29543&season=2008&displayPage=tab_gamecenter&week=REG1 <U+2013> NFL Game Center]</ref>

Next week against the [[2008 Kansas City Chiefs season|Kansas City Chiefs]], the Raiders won 23<U+2013>8. Russell passed for only 55 yards and completed 6-of-17 passes with no touchdowns or interceptions.

The next three weeks the Raiders lost against the [[Buffalo Bills]], [[San Diego Chargers]], and [[New Orleans Saints]]. Russell started all three games, but only threw a combined total of two touchdowns during that span.

In Week 7, the Raiders beat the [[New York Jets]] 16 <U+2013> 13 in overtime. The win ended their four-game home losing streak. Russell completed 17-of-30 passes for 203 yards and one touchdown.<ref>[http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter?game_id=29627&season=2008&displayPage=tab_gamecenter&week=REG7 <U+2013> NFL Game Center]</ref> It was head coach Tom Cable's first win as Raiders head coach.

The next four games were lost to the [[Baltimore Ravens]], [[Atlanta Falcons]], [[Carolina Panthers]], and [[Miami Dolphins]]. A week after the Miami game, Russell led the Raiders to a 31<U+2013>10 victory against Denver where he completed 10-of-11 passes for 152 yards and threw one touchdown.

Russell finished the 2008 season winning back to back games against the [[Houston Texans]] and [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]]. In those last three games, Russell threw for six touchdowns and two interceptions.

====2009 season====
In August, Russell was named starter of the Raiders.<ref>{{cite web|last=Karabell |first=Eric |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/blog/index?entryID=4419784&name=fantasy_football |title=JaMarcus Russell named Oakland Raiders starting quarterback <U+2013> ESPN |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-16}}</ref> Following a loss to the [[Kansas City Chiefs]] on November 15, Russell was benched indefinitely by coach [[Tom Cable]] due to poor play in favor of [[Bruce Gradkowski]]. Gradkowski led two fourth quarter comebacks and upset the [[Cincinnati Bengals]] and [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] in the following two weeks, throwing 5 touchdown passes. After Gradkoswki was injured against the [[Washington Redskins]], Russell finished the game for the Raiders, which resulted in a loss. After the game, coach Cable decided to start backup [[Charlie Frye]] rather than Russell, which moved Russell to #3 on the depth chart. When Frye was injured against the [[Denver Broncos]] Russell played near the end of the game. The game resulted in a win, however, this was Russell's final game as a Raider. He finished the 2009 season with the lowest quarterback rating, lowest completion percentage, fewest passing touchdowns, and fewest passing yards among qualifying quarterbacks in the NFL.<ref>[http://www.nfl.com/stats/categorystats?archive=false&seasonType=REG&d-447263-o=2&conference=null&statisticCategory=PASSING&d-447263-s=PASSING_PASSER_RATING&experience=null&d-447263-n=1&season=2009&Submit=Go&qualified=true&tabSeq=0&d-447263-p=1 QB rating]</ref>

In March of the 2010 offseason, NBC Sports described Russell as "annually and incredibly overweight", saying he arrived at mini-camp weighing 290 pounds, up from his initially reported weight of 271.<ref name="nbcsports032610">{{cite web|url=http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/36060532/ns/sports-player_news/|title=Report: JaMarcus Russell weighs 290 pounds - NFL- nbcsports.msnbc.com|date=March 26, 2010|work=[[NBC Sports]]|publisher=nbcsports.msnbc.com|accessdate=11 August 2010}}</ref> By April, National Football Post reported him at 300 pounds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalfootballpost.com/Source-JaMarcus-Russell-is-tipping-the-scales-at-300-pounds.html |title=Scout: JaMarcus Russell is tipping the scales at 300 pounds |publisher=National Football Post |date=2010-04-26 |accessdate=2010-09-16}}</ref> However, Cam Inman of ''[[The Oakland Tribune]]'' said that Russell had "a good first minicamp" and "is in great shape" in the team's first training camp in late April.<ref name="Oaktrib" >[http://www.mercurynews.com/raiders-headlines/ci_14992592 Candid Cam: Raiders' Russell stuns world, looks capable of 'competing']</ref> In an interview during camp, Russell said "Today I'm going to keep coming out, compete for the job, work my tail off."<ref name="Oaktrib" />

That same month, the Raiders traded for [[Washington Redskins]] quarterback [[Jason Campbell]], which left the team with five quarterbacks on <U+2013> Campbell, Russell, Frye, Gradkowski, and [[Kyle Boller]]. At the time, Raiders head coach Tom Cable said Russell could compete for the starting job.<ref>[http://content.usatoday.com/communities/thehuddle/post/2010/04/tom-cable-says-jamarcus-russell-can-compete-with-jason-campbell-for-raiders-starting-job/1 Tom Cable says JaMarcus Russell can compete with Jason Campbell for Raiders' starting job]</ref> Despite this, and because Russell was due a $9.45 million salary in 2010, some NFL experts reported that Russell would soon be released.

On May 6, the Raiders released Russell.<ref name="release">[http://www.mercurynews.com/breaking-news/ci_15032308 Oakland Raiders release quarterback JaMarcus Russell]</ref> One day later, Russell cleared [[Waivers (American football)|waivers]], making him an unrestricted free agent.<ref name="quickest released"/>

===Future in football===
[[New Orleans Saints]] head coach [[Sean Payton]] said on May 8, 2010 that the time was not right for the Saints to consider signing Louisiana-native Russell, but added in that it's "newsworthy" when a high draft pick is released so soon, and stated that players like Russell often get a second chance in the NFL.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=5173977 |title=Saints not interested in Russell|publisher=[[ESPN]] |date=2010-05-08 |accessdate=2010-09-16}}</ref>  However, due in part to concerns about his work ethic, his number has yet to be called by another NFL team.<ref name=Wertheim>{{cite news|first=L.

In 2013, Russell stated that he is interested in returning to the NFL, and will train with various NFL players, including [[Marshall Faulk]] and [[Jeff Garcia]], along with Olympian [[Ato Boldon]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Patra|first=Kevin|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap1000000129925/article/jamarcus-russell-preps-for-nfl-comeback-at-308-lbs|title=JaMarcus Russell preps for NFL comeback at 308 lbs.|publisher=[[National Football League]]|date=2013-01-23|accessdate=2013-01-23}}</ref><ref>http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nfl-shutdown-corner/nfl-draft-bust-jamarcus-russell-attempting-nfl-comeback-043914730--nfl.html</ref> Russell's comeback attempt was documented by [[Bleacher Report]] in a series titled ''JaMarcus Russell's Road Back to the NFL''.<ref>{{cite web|author=Aaron Nagler|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1535213-comeback-2013-jamarcus-russells-road-back-to-the-nfl-episode-2|title=Comeback 2013: JaMarcus Russell's Road Back to the NFL, Episode 2|publisher=''Bleacher Report''|date=February 19, 2013|accessdate=April 26, 2013}}</ref>

In May 2013, it was announced Russell had returned to his rookie weight of 265 pounds. Interest from the [[Chicago Bears]] and [[Baltimore Ravens]] had also been reported.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wesseling|first=Chris|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap1000000209222/article/jamarcus-russell-set-for-chicago-bears-workout-Friday|title=JaMarcus Russell set for Chicago Bears workout Friday|publisher=[[National Football League]]|date=2013-06-04|accessdate=2013-06-06}}</ref> Later on June 4, 2013, it was announced Russell would receive a tryout with the Bears.<ref>{{cite web|author=Michael C.

However, Russell, despite his sound try-out for the Bears, is not likely to be signed to a contract by Chicago.<ref>{{cite web|author=Michael C.

===Impact===
''NFL.com'''s Steve Wyche claimed that Russell is the biggest [[draft bust]] in NFL history.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wyche |first=Steve |url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story?id=09000d5d817ff891&template=with-video-with-comments&confirm=true |title=Russell supplants Leaf atop list of all-time draft busts |publisher=Nfl.com |date=2010-05-07 |accessdate=2010-09-16}}</ref> ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' named Russell one of the 13 biggest draft busts of the 2000s.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/04/22/nfl-draft-busts-13-huge-d_n_543475.html#s82214 |title=NFL Draft BUSTS: 14 HUGE Draft Disasters Of The Decade (PHOTOS) |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date= 2010-04-22|accessdate=2010-09-16 |first=Michael |last=Klopman}}</ref> ESPN's Bill Williamson called Russell a "talented but extremely disappointing" quarterback.<ref name="quickest released">{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=5172061 |title=Former Oakland Raiders quarterback JaMarcus Russell goes unclaimed, clears waivers <U+2013> ESPN |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=2010-05-07 |accessdate=2010-09-16}}</ref>

In addition, Russell's 2009 passer rating of 50.0 was the lowest rating by a starting quarterback in the NFL since 1998.<ref name="Grievance" /> His final stats during his tenure as a Raider were 52.1% pass completion, 18<U+2013>23 [[Touchdown|TD]]-[[Interception|INT]] ratio, a passer rating of 65.2, and 15 lost fumbles.<ref name="Grievance" />

No Oakland player wore Russell's #2 during the regular season for several years after his release (although punter [[Marquette King]] did wear that number during Oakland's 2012 preseason before being placed on season-ending [[injured reserve]]). In 2011, newly-drafted quarterback [[Terrelle Pryor]]'s request to wear #2 was turned down by then-coach [[Hue Jackson]]; it is widely believed that the Raiders did not want another highly touted quarterback wearing the same number as the disappointing Russell.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2011/writers/ann_killion/08/26/terrelle.pryor/|publisher = Sports Illustrated|author =Killion, Ann|title=New number, opportunity for Pryor|date=August 26, 2011}}</ref> However, in 2013 Raiders coach [[Dennis Allen (American football)|Dennis Allen]] allowed Pryor to trade numbers with King; he debuted on Oakland's practice field 21 August 2013 wearing the jersey number he had worn at Ohio State.<ref>{{cite web|last=Sessler|first=Marc|title=Raiders' Terrelle Pryor takes JaMarcus Russell's No. 2|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap1000000232664/article/terrelle-pryor-wearing-jamarcus-russells-no-2|work=NFL Around the League|publisher=NFL Enterprises LLC|accessdate=23 August 2013}}</ref>

==Personal==
Russell was born to Bobby Lloyd and Zina L. Russell-Anderson, a machine operator in a furniture factory and a [[law firm]] secretary, respectively.

Russell is a cousin of [[Robert Jordan (American football player)|Robert Jordan]], formerly of the [[California Golden Bears]] and [[San Francisco 49ers]], and [[Marshawn Lynch]] of the [[Seattle Seahawks]].

His uncle Ray Ray Russell was a long-time DJ and radio host for the [[Mobile, Alabama]]-based station [[WBLX-FM|WBLX]] until his death in 2009. In 2011 his cousin DeAngelo Parker started Ray Ray's Chicken and Waffles franchise in honor of him in Mobile, Alabama .<ref>{{cite news

===Codeine syrup possession arrest===
On July 5, 2010, Russell was arrested at his Mobile, Alabama home for being in possession of [[codeine]] syrup without a valid prescription.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2010/07/06/SPTM1E9TT7.DTL | title=Russell accused of illegal codeine possession | first=Vittorio | last=Tafur | date=July 7, 2010 | work=The San Francisco Chronicle}}</ref> His arrest was the culmination of a two-month investigation that did not initially target Russell, but his name and address surfaced repeatedly during the investigation.<ref>[http://www.nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/38113855 ]{{dead link|date=September 2010}}</ref> Russell was bailed out, and a bond hearing was scheduled for July 7, 2010. At his July 20, 2010 arraignment, Russell pleaded 'not guilty' to a state felony charge of possession of a controlled substance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=5394803 |title=Former Oakland Raider JaMarcus Russell pleads not guilty to felony drug charge <U+2013> ESPN |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=2010-07-20 |accessdate=2010-09-16}}</ref> On October 29, 2010, a Mobile County grand jury declined to indict Russell on the charge of possession of codeine syrup without a prescription.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/thehuddle/post/2010/10/no-charges-for-jamarcus-russell-in-purple-drank-case/1 |title=No charges for JaMarcus Russell in 'purple drank' case |publisher=USATODAY.com |date=2010-10-29 |accessdate=2010-12-30}}</ref> By at least one account, the arrest severely diminished his prospects of catching on with another NFL team.<ref name=Wertheim/>

In an interview with [[ESPN]]'s Colleen Dominguez, Russell stated that he tested positive for codeine after he was selected by the Raiders in the [[2007 NFL Draft]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/sportscenter/post/_/id/73367/jamarcus-russell-admits-positive-test-for-codeine |title=JaMarcus Russell Admits Positive Test For Codeine |publisher=SportsCenter.com |date=2010-08-13 |accessdate=2010-12-30}}</ref>
