'''Distinguished Flying Cross'''

2nd Lt. Francis James Ralph.

A brave and skilful observer who has
taken part in many combats with enemy
aircraft, invariably displaying cool courage
and presence of mind. On a recent occasion
our patrol of eleven machines, after
bombing a railway junction, was attacked by
fifteen enemy scouts. One of these, which
was engaged by this officer's pilot, crumpled
and fell. The formation was then attacked
by seven Fokkers from above, one of which
was shot down by 2nd Lt. Ralph.<ref name="london-gazette.co.uk"/>
