'''Cusco''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|<U+02C8>|k|u<U+02D0>|s|k|o<U+028A>}}; often spelled '''Cuzco'''; [[Quechua languages|Quechua]]: '''Qusqu''' {{IPA-qu|<U+02C8>qo<U+031D>s.qo|}}) is a city in southeastern [[Peru]], near the [[Sacred Valley|Urubamba Valley]] of the [[Andes]] mountain range. It is the capital of the [[Cusco Region]] as well as the [[Cusco Province]]. In 2007, the city had a population of 358,935 which was triple the figure of 20 years ago. Located on the eastern end of the Knot of Cusco, its altitude is around {{convert|3400|m|ft|abbr=on}}.

Cusco was the site of the historic capital of the [[Inca Empire]] and was declared a [[World Heritage Site]] in 1983 by [[UNESCO]]. It is a major tourist destination and receives almost 1.5 million visitors a year. It is designated as the Historical Capital of Peru by the [[Constitution of Peru]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://pdba.georgetown.edu/Constitutions/Peru/per93reforms05.html#titIIcapI |title=Constituci<U+00F3>n del Per<U+044A> de 1993 |publisher=Pdba.georgetown.edu |date= |accessdate=22 July 2009}}</ref>

==Spelling and etymology==
The aboriginal name of this city was ''Qosqo''.  Although it was used in [[Classical Quechua|Quechua]], its origin has been found in the [[Aymara language|Aymara]] language.  The word itself originated in the phrase ''qusqu wanka'' ('Rock of the owl'), attending to the foundational myth of the Ayar Siblings.  According to this legend, Ayar Auca (''Ayar Awqa'') got wings and flew to the site of the future city and transformed into a rock to mark the possession of the land by his [[ayllu]] ('linage').<ref>{{Cite journal

Ayar Auca, after hearing the words of his brother, rose on his wings and went to that place [[Manco Capac]] commanded him, he sat there and turned himself into stone and became a possession mark, which in the ancient language of this valley is called cozco, therefore this place remained with the name of Cozco until today.

The [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] [[conquistador]]s adopted the local name, [[transliteration|transliterating]] it into Spanish as ''Cu'''z'''co'' or less often ''Cozco''.  ''Cuzco'' was the standard spelling on official documents and chronicles at the colonial epoch.<ref>{{Cite journal

In 1976, the City Mayor of Cuzco signed an ordinance banning the traditional spelling and ordering the use of a new one, ''Cusco'', in the municipalty publications.  Nineteen years later, in 23 June 1990, the local authorities officialized a brand new spelling instead: ''Qosqo''.

===Killke culture===
The ''[[Killke culture|Killke]]'' occupied the region from 900 to 1200, prior to the arrival of the ''[[Incas]]'' in the 13th century.  Carbon-14 dating of ''Sacsayhuaman'', the walled complex outside Cusco, has demonstrated that the ''Killke'' culture constructed the fortress about 1100.  The Inca later expanded and occupied the complex in the 13th century and after.  On 13 March 2008, [[archaeologist]]s discovered the ruins of an ancient [[temple]], roadway and [[acqueduct]] system at ''[[Sacsayhuaman]]''.<ref>[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2008/03/080331-inca-temple.html Kelly Hearn, "Ancient Temple Discovered Among Inca Ruins"], ''National Geographic News'', 31 March 2008, accessed 12 January 2010</ref>  This find plus the results of excavations in 2007, when another temple was found at the edge of the fortress, indicates religious as well as military use of the facility.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.comcast.net/news/index.jsp?cat=GENERAL&fn=/2008/03/14/911994.html&cookieattempt=1 |title=NEWS - Comcast.net |publisher=Comcast.net<! |date= |accessdate=22 July 2009}}</ref>

===Inca history===
{{See also|Kingdom of Cusco|Inca Empire}}

Cusco was the capital of the [[Inca Empire]] (13th century-1532).  Many believe that the city was planned as an [[effigy]] in the shape of a [[Cougar|puma]], a [[sacred]] [[animal]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cusco.net/articulos/cuscoinca.htm#Puma |title=The history of Cusco |publisher=cusco.net<! |date= |accessdate=25 July 2009}}</ref>  Under the Inca, the city had two sectors: the ''urin'' and ''hanan''.  Each was further divided to encompass two of the four provinces, [[Chinchasuyu]] (NW), [[Antisuyu]] (NE), [[Qontisuyu]] (SW) and [[Collasuyu]] (SE).  A road led from each of these quarters to the corresponding quarter of the empire.  Each local leader was required to build a house in the city and live part of the year in Cusco, but only in the quarter that corresponded to the quarter of the empire in which he had territory.  After the rule of [[Pachacuti]], when an [[Sapa Inca|Inca]] died, his title went to one son and his property was given to a corporation controlled by his other relatives (the process was called [[split inheritance]]).  Each title holder had to build a new house and add new lands to the empire, in order to own the land his family needed to maintain after his death.

According to Inca legend, the city was built by [[Sapa Inca]] ''[[Pachacuti]]'', the man who transformed the Kingdom of Cusco from a sleepy city-state into the vast empire of ''[[Tahuantinsuyu]]''.  Archaeological evidence, however, points to a slower, more organic growth of the city beginning before ''Pachacuti''.  The city was constructed according to a definite plan, and two rivers were channeled around the city.  Archaeologists such as [[Larry Coben]] have suggested the city plan was replicated at other sites throughout the empire.

The city fell to the sphere of ''[[Hu<U+00E1>scar]]'' in the division of the empire after the death of ''[[Huayna Capac]]'' in 1527. It was captured by the generals of ''[[Atahualpa]]'' in April 1532 in the [[Battle of Quipaipan]].  Nineteen months later, Spanish explorers invaded the city (see [[battle of Cuzco]]).

===Cusco after the Spanish invasion===
[[File:Capitulo-XCII.jpg|thumb|240px|right|The first image of Cuzco in Europe. [[Pedro Cieza de Leon]]. [[Cronica del Peru]], 1553.]]

The first [[Spanish Empire|Spaniards]] arrived in the city on 15 November 1533.  [[Francisco Pizarro]] officially arrived in Cusco on 23 March 1534, renaming it the "Very noble and great city of Cuzco".  The many buildings constructed after the Hispanic invasion have a mixture of Spanish influence with Inca indigenous architecture, including the Santa Clara and San Blas neighborhoods. The Spanish destroyed many Inca buildings, temples and palaces.  They used the remaining walls as bases for the construction of a new city.  Cusco stands on layers of cultures, with the old ''Tawantinsuyu'' built on Killke structures, and the Spanish having replaced [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] temples with [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] churches, and palaces with mansions for the invaders.

Cusco was the center for the Spanish colonization and spread of Christianity in the [[Andes|Andean]] world.  It became very prosperous thanks to agriculture, [[cattle]] raising, and [[mining]], as well as the trade with [[Habsburg Spain|Spain]]. The Spanish colonists constructed many churches and [[convent]]s, as well as a [[Cathedral of Santo Domingo (Cusco)|cathedral]], [[National University of San Antonio Abad in Cuzco|university]] and [[Archbishopric]].  Just as the Inca built on top of Killke structures, Spanish buildings were based on the massive stone walls built by the Inca.

A major earthquake on 21 May 1950 caused severe localised damage in Cusco. The Dominican Priory and Church of Santo Domingo, which were built on top of the impressive ''[[Qoricancha]]'' (Temple of the Sun), were among the colonial era buildings affected. The city's Inca architecture, however, withstood the earthquake.  Many of the old Inca walls were at first thought to have been lost after the earthquake, but the [[granite]] retaining walls of the ''Qoricancha'' were exposed, as well as those of other ancient structures throughout the city.  Restoration work at the Santo Domingo complex was conducted in such a way as to expose the Inca masonry formerly obscured by the super-structure without compromising the integrity of the colonial heritage.<ref>http://www.sacred-destinations.com/peru/cusco-koricancha.htm</ref> Cusco had also been the center of a major earthquake in 1650, and many of the buildings damaged in 1950 had been impacted by an earthquake only nine years previously.<ref>http://bssa.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/abstract/44/2A/97</ref>

===Republican era===
After [[Peru]] declared its independence in 1821, Cusco maintained its importance within the administrative structure of the country.  Upon independence, the government created the [[Cusco Region|Department of Cusco]], maintaining authority over territory extending to the Brazilian border. Cusco was made capital of the department; subsequently it became the most important city in the south-eastern Andean region.

At the beginning of the 20th century, the city's urban sprawl spread to the neighboring districts of [[Santiago District, Cusco|Santiago]] and [[Wanchaq District|Wanchaq]].

In 1911, [[explorer]] [[Hiram Bingham III|Hiram Bingham]] used the city as a base for the expedition in which he rediscovered the ruins of [[Machu Picchu]].

====Honors====
*In 1933, the Congress of Americanists met in [[La Plata]], Argentina and declared the city as the Archeological Capital of the Americas.
*In 1978, the 7th Convention of Mayors of Great World Cities met in [[Milan]], Italy and declared Cusco a Cultural Heritage of the World.
*In 1983, [[UNESCO]], in Paris, France declared the city a [[World Heritage Site]].  The [[Government of Peru|Peruvian government]] declared it the Tourism Capital of Peru and Cultural Heritage of the Nation.
*In 2007, the New7Wonders Foundation designated [[Machu Picchu]] one of the [[New Seven Wonders of the World]], following a worldwide poll.<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/07/08/1972797.htm ''Reuters via ABC News Australia "Opera House snubbed as new Wonders unveiled" 7 July 2007]</ref>

===Present===
[[File:Inca nativity.jpg|thumb|left|A Cusco man participates in a live nativity scene on Christmas Eve, 2008.]]

A 1950 earthquake shook the city, causing the destruction of more than one third of the city's structures.  Later, the city began to establish itself as a focal point for tourism and began to receive a greater number of tourists.

Since the 1990s, tourism increased, and the hotel sector subsequently expanded.  Currently, Cusco is the most important tourist destination in [[Peru]].  The city's urban sprawl is still expanding, having extended to the [[San Sebastian District|San Sebastian]] and [[San Jer<U+00F3>nimo District, Cusco|San Jer<U+00F3>nimo]] districts.

Under the administration of mayor Daniel Estrada P<U+00E9>rez, a staunch supporter of the ''[[Academia Mayor de la Lengua Quechua]]'', between 1983 and 1995 the [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] name ''Qosqo'' was officially adopted for the city.

Although the original Inca city was said to have been founded in the 11th century, more recently scholars have established that Inca did not occupy the area until after 1200 AD.  Before them the [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] people of the [[Killke culture]] built the walled complex of [[Sacsayhuaman]] about 1100 AD.  In November 2008, archeological researchers found that the Killke also built a major temple near Sacsayhuaman, as well as an [[acqueduct]] and roadway connecting prehistoric structures.

The Spanish explorer [[Francisco Pizarro|Pizarro]] sacked much of the Inca city in 1535.  Remains of the palace of the Incas, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Virgins of the Sun still stand.  In addition, Inca buildings and foundations in some cases have proved to be stronger than the foundations built in present-day Peru.  Among the most noteworthy Spanish colonial buildings of the city is the [[Cathedral of Santo Domingo, Cusco]].

The major nearby Inca sites are Pachacuti's presumed winter home, [[Machu Picchu]], which can be reached on foot by an [[Inca road system|Inca trail]] or by train; and the "fortress" at [[Ollantaytambo]].  Sacsayhuaman was expanded by the Inca.

Less-visited [[ruins]] include: [[Inca Wasi]], the highest of all Inca sites at {{convert|3980|m|ft|abbr=on}}; [[Vilcabamba, Peru|Old Vilcabamba]] the capital of the Inca after the capture of Cusco; the [[sculpture garden]] at [[Chulquipalta]] (aka ''Chuquipalta'', ''<U+00D1>usta Espa<U+00F1>a'', ''The White Rock'', ''Yurak Rumi''); [[Tip<U+00F3>n]] with working water channels in wide terraces; as well as [[Huillca Raccay]], [[Patallacta]], [[Choquequirao]], [[Moray (Inca ruin)|Moray]] and many others.

The surrounding area, located in the Huatanay Valley, is strong in [[gold]] mining and agriculture, including [[maize|corn]], [[barley]], [[quinoa]], tea and [[coffee]].

Thanks to remodelling, Cusco's main stadium [[Estadio Garcilaso de la Vega]] attracted more tourists during South America's continental soccer championship, the [[Copa Am<U+00E9>rica 2004]] held in Peru.  The stadium is home to one of the country's most successful soccer clubs, ''[[Cienciano]]''. Cusco's local team has built a reputation in the world of club soccer, as it has won several international competitions in South America.  It has yet to achieve such success in its home country.

The city is served by [[Alejandro Velasco Astete International Airport]].

=== Architectural heritage ===
[[File:Calle-del-medio-Cusco.jpg|thumb||Calle Mantas, to the right is the belltower of the Church and convent of La Merced.]]

Because of its antiquity and importance, the center of the city retains many buildings, plazas and streets of [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] times and colonial buildings, which led to his being declared a [[World Heritage Site]] by [[UNESCO]] in 1983. Among the main sights of the city are:

==== Barrio de San Blas ====

This neighborhood housing artisans, workshops and craft shops, is one of the most picturesque sites in the city. Its streets are steep and narrow with old houses built by the Spanish over important Inca foundations. It has an attractive square and the oldest parish church in Cuzco, built in 1563, which has a carved wooden pulpit considered the epitome of Colonial era woodwork in Cuzco.

The Quechua name of this neighborhood is Toq'ocachi which means the opening of the Salt

==== Calle Hatun Rumiyuq ====

This street is the most visited by tourists. On the street ''Hatun Rumiyoq'' ("Of the Old Rock") was the palace of [[Inca Roca]], which was converted to the Archbishop's residence.

Along this street that runs from the Plaza de Armas to the Barrio de San Blas, one can see the Stone of Twelve Angles, which is viewed as marvel of ancient stonework and has become emblematic of the city's history.

==== Convent and Church of la Merced ====

Its foundation dates from 1536. The first complex was destroyed by the earthquake of 1650 and the rebuilding of the church and convent was completed in 1675.

Its cloisters of [[Spanish Baroque architecture|Baroque]] [[Renaissance]] style, choir stalls, colonial paintings and wood carvings are highlights of a visit to this church, now a popular museum and tourist attraction.

Also on view is an elaborate [[monstrance]] made of gold and gemstones which weighs 22 kilos and is {{convert|130|cm|2|abbr=on}} in height.

==== Cathedral ====
{{Main|Cathedral of Santo Domingo, Cusco}}

The first cathedral built in Cuzco is the ''Iglesia del Triunfo'', built in 1539 on the foundations of the Palace of [[Viracocha (Inca)|Viracocha Inca]]. Today, this church is an auxiliary chapel of the Cathedral.

The main basilica cathedral of the citywas built between 1560 and 1664. Stone was used as the main material, which was extracted from nearby quarries, although some blocks of red granite were taken from the fortress known as [[Sacsayhuam<U+00E1>n]].

This great cathedral, of Renaissance plan interior presents late-Gothic, Baroque and plateresque interiors, and has one of the most outstanding examples of colonial goldwork. Its carved wooden altars are also important.

The city developed a distinctive style of painting known as the "[[Cuzco School]]", and the cathedral houses a major collection of local artists of the time. 

The cathedral is the seat of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cuzco|Archdiocese of Cuzco]].

==== Plaza de Armas ====

Known as the "Square of the warrior" in the Inca era, this plaza has been the scene of several important events in the history of this city, such as the proclamation by [[Francisco Pizarro]] in the conquest of Cuzco.

Similarly, the Plaza de Armas was the scene of the death of [[T<U+00FA>pac Amaru II]], considered the indigenous leader of the resistance.

The Spanish built stone arcades around the plaza which endure to this day. The main cathedral and the Church of La Compa<U+00F1><U+00ED>a both open directly onto the plaza.

[[File:82 - Cuzco - Juin 2009.jpg|thumb|center|815px|<center>The Plaza de Armas of the city of Cuzco, Peru at night.</center>]]

==== Church of la Compa<U+00F1><U+00ED>a ====

This church, whose construction was initiated by the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] in 1576 on the foundations of the Amarucancha or the palace of the Inca [[Huayna Capac]], is considered one of the best examples of colonial baroque style on the American continents.

Its facade is carved in stone and its main altar is made of carved wood covered with gold leaf. It was built over an underground chapel. 

This church has a valuable collection of colonial paintings of the Cusco School.

[[File:109 - Cuzco - Juillet 2009.jpg|thumb|left|280px|Night view of the Coricancha.]]

==== Coricancha and Convent of Santo Domingo ====
{{Main|Coricancha}}

The Coricancha (Quri Kancha) was the most important sanctuary dedicated to the Sun god [[Inti]] at the time of the [[Inca Empire]]. This temple was named the site of gold because all its walls were covered with [[gold]] leaf by the [[Incas]].

With this structure as a foundation, colonists built the [[Convent of Santo Domingo (Cuzco)|Convent of Santo Domingo]], in the Renaissance style. The building, with one baroque tower, exceeds the height of many other buildings in this city.

Inside is a large collection of paintings from the [[Cuzco School]].

==Population==
Until the late 18th century Cuzco was the most populous city in the continent, even more than Lima. But because of the great revolution of T<U+00FA>pac Amaru in 1780, the white population migrated to Arequipa considered as the most secure and safe from a possible new uprising. So to the 20th century the population was largely mestizo and indigenous, but now the white population has grown significantly in the city as high as 30%, as it is experiencing a demographic explosion process led by the tourism boom.

The city has a population of 390,000 people by 2008 according to [[Instituto Nacional de Estad<U+00ED>stica e Inform<U+00E1>tica|INEI]].

==Food==
[[File:Plaza de Armas de Cuzco.jpg|300px|thumb|The Plaza de Armas of Cusco]]
As headquarters to the Inca Empire, Cusco was an important agricultural region.  It was a natural reserve for thousands of native Peruvian species, including around 2,000 varieties of [[potato]] cultivated by the people.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.solutions-site.org/artman/publish/article_338.shtml |title=Cusco, Peru Bans GM Products To Protect Diversity Of Native Potatoes |publisher=Solutions-site.org |date= |accessdate=22 July 2009}}</ref> Recently many fusion and neo-Andean restaurants have developed in Cusco, in which the cuisine is prepared with modern techniques and incorporates a blend of traditional Andean and international ingredients.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20071120020007/http://www.sazonperu.com/busqueda/ciudad/index.php?idprov=137&flag=1&iddpto=8&idio= Guide to Peruvian Food, Cusco Reference]</ref>
