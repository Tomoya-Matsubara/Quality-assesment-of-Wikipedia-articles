The other species in genus ''Pan'' is ''Pan troglodytes'', or the [[Common Chimpanzee]]. Although the name "chimpanzee" is sometimes used to refer to both species together, it is usually understood as referring to the Common Chimpanzee, while ''Pan paniscus'' is usually referred to as the Bonobo.

One source reports a lifespan of 40 years in captivity.<ref>Rowe N. Pictural Guide to the Living Primates. Pogonias Press, 1996. East Hampton. 263pp (ISBN 0964882515)</ref> There is no data about longevity in wild-living bonobos or on gender differences.

The Bonobo is very endangered and is found in the wild only in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. Along with the Common Chimpanzee, the Bonobo is the closest [[Extant taxon|extant]] relative to [[humans]]. Because the two species are not proficient swimmers, it is possible that the formation of the [[Congo River]] 1.5 <U+2013> 2 million years ago led to the [[speciation]] of the Bonobo. They live south of the river, and thereby were separated from the ancestors of the Common Chimpanzee, which live north of the river.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Caswell JL, Mallick S, Richter DJ, ''et al'' |title=Analysis of chimpanzee history based on genome sequence alignments |journal=PLoS Genet. |volume=4 |issue=4 |pages=e1000057 |year=2008|pmid=18421364 |pmc=2278377 |doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1000057 }}</ref>

[[Germany|German]] anatomist [[Ernst Schwarz]] is credited with having discovered the Bonobo in 1928, based on his analysis of a [[skull]] in the [[Tervuren]] museum in [[Belgium]] that previously had been thought to have belonged to a juvenile chimpanzee.

The species is distinguished by relatively long legs, pink lips, dark face and tail-tuft through adulthood, and parted long hair on its head. Although Bonobos are generally understood to be a [[matriarch]]al species, there are also claims of a special role for the alpha male in group movement.

Bonobos are perceived to be matriarchal:  Females tend to collectively dominate males by forming alliances; females use their sexuality to control males; a male's rank in the social hierarchy is determined by his mother's rank. <ref name="ny2007-07">{{cite web|last=Parker |first=Ian |url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2007/07/30/070730fa_fact_parker |title=Our Far-Flung Correspondents: Swingers: Reporting & Essays |publisher=The New Yorker |date=2009-01-07 |accessdate=2009-07-03}}</ref><ref name="was-ardi-a-liberal">{{cite web|last=de Waal |first=Frans |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/frans-de-waal/was-ardi-perhaps-liberal_b_325201.html |title=Was "Ardi" a Liberal? |publisher=The Huffington Post |date=2009-10-18 |accessdate=2009-10-18}}</ref>    The limited research on Bonobos in the wild was taken to indicate that these behaviors may be exaggerated by captivity, as well as by food provisioning by researchers in the field.<ref name="ny2007-07" /> This view has recently been challenged, however, by Duke University's Vanessa Woods;<ref>[http://www.vanessawoods.net/research.html Research], Vanessa Woods</ref>    Woods noted in a recent radio interview<ref>[http://www.skepticallyspeaking.com/episodes/61-bonobo-handshake #61 Bonobo Handshake].

==Name==
===Common name===
The name ''Bonobo'' first appeared in 1954, when Edward Tratz and Heinz Heck proposed it as a new and separate generic term for pygmy chimpanzees. The term has been reported variously {{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} as being a word for "chimpanzee" or "ancestor" in a [[Bantu languages|Bantu language]]. Another suggestion for the derivation of the name is that the name is a misspelling of the name of the town of Bolobo on the [[Congo River]], which has been associated with the collection of chimps in the 1920s.<ref>{{cite book|author=Sue Savage-Rumbaugh & Roger Lewin|title=Kanzi: the ape at the brink of the human mind|year=1994|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|page=97 isbn=0471585912|isbn=0385403321}}</ref>

===Taxonomy===
The scientific name for the Bonobo is ''Pan paniscus''. 
While no official publication on the bonobo genome is publicly available, an initial analysis by the ''[[National Human Genome Research Institute]]'' confirmed that the bonobo genome diverges about 0.4 % from the chimpanzee genome. In addition, the group around [[Svante P<U+00E4><U+00E4>bo]] of the ''[[Max Planck Institute]] for Evolutionary Anthropology'' is actually sequencing the genome of a female bonobo from the Leipzig zoo.<ref>[http://www.genomeweb.com/sequencing/neandertal-bonobo-genomes-may-shed-light-human-evolution-mpi-454-preparing-draft By Julia Karow. Neandertal, Bonobo Genomes May Shed Light On Human Evolution; MPI, 454 Preparing Drafts. May 13, 2008]</ref> Initial genetic studies characterised the [[DNA]] of chimpanzees (Common Chimpanzee and Bonobo, collectively) as being as much as 98% (99.4 in one study) identical to that of ''[[Homo sapiens]]''.<ref name=BonoboDNA>{{cite web|url= http://www.colszoo.org/animalareas/aforest/bonobo.html|title= Colombus Zoo: Bonobo|accessdate= 2006-08-01 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060502101116/http://www.colszoo.org/animalareas/aforest/bonobo.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2006-05-02}}</ref> Later studies showed that chimpanzees are more closely related to humans than to [[gorillas]].<ref name=Takahata>{{cite journal|author = Takahata, N.; Satta, Y. & Klein, J.|year = 1995|title = Divergence time and population size in the lineage leading to modern humans|journal = Theor Popul Biol|volume = 48|issue = 2|pages = 198<U+2013>221|doi = 10.1006/tpbi.1995.1026|pmid = 7482371}}</ref> The most recent genetic analyses (published in 2006) of chimpanzee and human genetic similarity come from whole [[genome]] comparisons and have shown that the differences between the two species are more complex, both in extent and character, than the historical 98% figure suggests.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=human-chimp-gene-gap-wide|title= Human-Chimp Gene Gap Widens from Tally of Duplicate Genes|accessdate= 2010-02-25}}</ref>

In the seminal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' paper reporting on initial genome comparisons, researchers identified thirty-five million [[Single nucleotide polymorphism|single-nucleotide changes]], five million insertion or deletion events, and a number of [[Chromosomal translocation|chromosomal rearrangements]] which constituted the genetic differences between chimpanzees and humans, covering 98% of the same genes.<ref name=ChimpGenome>{{cite journal|author = The Chimpanzee Sequencing and Analysis Consortium|date = 1 September 2005|title = Initial sequence of the chimpanzee genome and comparison with the human genome|journal = Nature|volume = 437 |issue=7055|pages = 69<U+2013>87|doi = 10.1038/nature04072 |pmid=16136131}}</ref> While many of these analyses have been performed on the Common Chimpanzee rather than the Bonobo, the differences between the two chimpanzee species are unlikely to be substantial enough to affect the ''Pan''-''Homo'' comparative data significantly.

There still is controversy, however. Scientists such as [[Jared Diamond]] in ''[[The Third Chimpanzee]]'', and [[Morris Goodman]]<ref>{{cite journal|author = Hecht, Jeff|title = Chimps are human, gene study implies|journal = New Scientist|date = 2003-05-19|accessdate = 2006-10-18|doi = }}</ref> of [[Wayne State University]] in [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]] argue that the Bonobo and Common Chimpanzee are so closely related to humans that their [[genus]] name also should be classified with the human genus ''Homo'': ''Homo paniscus'', ''Homo sylvestris'', or ''Homo arboreus''. An alternative philosophy suggests that the term ''Homo sapiens'' is the [[misnomer]] rather, and that humans should be reclassified as ''Pan sapiens'', though this would violate the [[Rule of Priority]] as ''Homo'' was named before ''Pan'' (1758 for the former, 1816 for the latter). In either case, a name change of the genus would have implications on the [[taxonomy]] of other species closely related to humans, including ''[[Australopithecus]]''. Ideas such as this are considered far outside the mainstream. The current line between ''Homo'' and non-''Homo'' species is drawn about 2 million years ago, and chimpanzee and human ancestry converges only about 7 million years ago, nearly three times earlier.

Recent DNA evidence suggests the Bonobo and Common Chimpanzee species effectively separated from each other less than one million years ago.<ref>{{cite journal|author = Won, Yong-Jin et al.|title = Divergence Population Genetics of Chimpanzees|volume = 22|issue = 2|journal = Molecular Biology & Evolution|pages = 297<U+2013>307|date = 2004-10-13|doi = 10.1093/molbev/msi017|pmid = 15483319}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author = Fischer, Anne et al.|title = Evidence for a Complex Demographic History of Chimpanzees|volume = 21|issue = 5|journal = Molecular Biology & Evolution|pages = 799<U+2013>808|date = 2004-02-12|doi = 10.1093/molbev/msh083|pmid = 14963091}}</ref> The chimpanzee line split from the [[human evolution|last common ancestor]] shared with [[human]]s approximately six to seven million years ago. Because no species other than ''Homo sapiens'' has survived from the human line of that branching, both ''Pan'' species are the closest living relatives of humans and [[cladistics|cladistically]] are equally close to humans.

==Physical characteristics==
[[Image:Bonobo 009.jpg|thumb|Bonobo]]
The Bonobo is sometimes considered to be more [[gracile]] than the Common Chimpanzee, and females are somewhat smaller than males. Its head is smaller than that of the Common Chimpanzee with less prominent brow ridges above the eyes. It has a black face with pink lips, small ears, wide nostrils, and long hair on its head that forms a part. Females have slightly more prominent breasts, in contrast to the flat breasts of other female apes, although not so prominent as those of humans. The Bonobo also has a slim upper body, narrow shoulders, thin neck, and long legs when compared to the Common Chimpanzee. The Bonobo [[walking|walk]]s upright approximately 25% of the time during ground locomotion. Its quadrupedal ground locomotion generally is characterized by forelimb 'palm walking'{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}, similar to [[orangutan]]s and in contrast to the predominant use of knuckles as characteristic of gorillas and the Common Chimpanzees. These physical characteristics and its posture give the Bonobo an appearance more closely resembling that of humans than that of the Common Chimpanzee (see: [http://www.emory.edu/LIVING_LINKS/OurInnerApe/faq.html bipedal Bonobos]). The Bonobo also has highly individuated facial features, as humans do, so that one individual may look significantly different from another, a characteristic adapted for visual facial recognition in social interaction.

==Diet==
This [[primate]] is mainly [[frugivorous]], but supplements its diet with leaves and meat from small vertebrates such as [[flying squirrel]]s and [[duiker]]s,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ihobe H |title=Observations on the meat-eating behavior of wild bonobos (''Pan paniscus'') at Wamba, Republic of Zaire |journal=Primates |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=247<U+2013>250|year=1992 |doi=10.1007/BF02382754 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/h7145027g60n708l/}}</ref> and invertebrates.<ref>Rafert, J. and E.O.

==Psychological characteristics==
{{POV-section|date=August 2010}}
[[Frans de Waal]], one of the world's most respected and popular [[primatologist]]s, states that the Bonobo is capable of [[altruism]], [[compassion]], [[empathy]], kindness, patience, and [[sensitivity (human)|sensitivity]]. How peaceful Bonobos are has been disputed by some, however.

Observations in the wild indicate that the males among the related Common Chimpanzee communities are extraordinarily hostile to males from outside the community. Parties of males 'patrol' for the unfortunate neighbouring males who might be traveling alone, and attack those single males, often killing them. This does not appear to be the behavior of the Bonobo males or females in their own communities, where they seem to prefer sexual contact over violent confrontation with outsiders. In fact, the Japanese scientists who have spent the most time working with wild Bonobos describe the species as extraordinarily peaceful, and De Waal has documented how Bonobos may often resolve conflicts with sexual contact (hence the "make love <U+2013> not war" characterization for the species). However, conflict is still possible between rival groups of Bonobos: the Congolese researcher Mola Ihomi has reported confrontations between bands of Bonobos which result in physical violence, sometimes resulting in serious injuries from bite wounds. Bonobos live in different areas from the more aggressive Common Chimpanzee.<ref name="smithsonianmag.com">[http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/bonobo.html?c=y&page=4 The Smart and Swinging Bonobo|Science & Nature|Smithsonian Magazine]. Smithsonianmag.com. Retrieved on 2011-02-15.</ref>     Neither of the species swims, and their respective ranges are separated by the Congo River with Bonobos living south of the river and Chimpanzees living north of the river. It has been hypothesized that Bonobos are able to live a more peaceful lifestyle in part because of an abundance of nutritious vegetation in their natural habitat, allowing them to travel and forage in large parties.

The popular image of the Bonobo as a peaceful ape does not always apply to captive populations. Accounts exist of Bonobos confined in [[zoo]]s mutilating one another and engaging in bullying. These incidents may be due to the practice in zoos of separating mothers and sons, which is contrary to their social organization in the wild. Bonobo society is dominated by females, and severing the lifelong alliance between mothers and their male offspring may make them vulnerable to female aggression. De Waal has warned of the danger of romanticizing Bonobos: "All animals are competitive by nature and cooperative only under specific circumstances" as well as writing that "when first writing about their behavior, I spoke of 'sex for peace' precisely because bonobos had plenty of conflicts. There would obviously be no need for peacemaking if they lived in perfect harmony". Because research of Bonobos in the wild is still immature compared to that of the Common Chimpanzee, lethal aggression between Bonobos could still be discovered.

Hohmann and Surbeck published in 2008 that Bonobos sometimes do hunt monkey species. Having observed a group of Bonobos in [[Salonga National Park]], they witnessed five incidents in five years in which Bonobos preyed on monkeys. Their research indicates it was deliberate hunting in which a group of Bonobos would coordinate their actions <U+2013> contrary to their normal hunting behaviour which is quite solitary and less purposeful. On three occasions, the hunt was successful and infant monkeys were captured.

===Social behavior===
[[Image:BonoboFishing05.jpeg|thumb|Bonobo fishing for termites]]
Most studies indicate that females have a higher social status in Bonobo society, though some field work suggests that Bonobo troops are led by an [[alpha male]] (though females in this scenario are not subordinate to all adult males as is the case with Chimpanzees).<ref>[http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/bonobo.html?c=y&page=2 The Smart and Swinging Bonobo|Science & Nature|Smithsonian Magazine]. Smithsonianmag.com. Retrieved on 2011-02-15.</ref>    Aggressive encounters between males and females are rare, and males are tolerant of infants and juveniles. A male's status is derived from the status of his mother. The mother-son bond often stays strong and continues throughout life. While social hierarchies do exist, rank plays a less prominent role than in other primate societies.

Bonobo [[Group size measures|party size]] tends to vary because the groups exhibit a [[Fission-fusion society|fission-fusion pattern]]. A community of approximately 100 will split into small groups during the day while looking for food, and then comes back together to sleep. They sleep in trees in nests that they construct.

===Sexual social behavior===

[[Sexual intercourse]] plays a major role in Bonobo society observed in captivity, being used as what some scientists perceive as a [[greeting]], a means of [[conflict resolution]], and [[reconciliation (democratic process)#In animals|post-conflict reconciliation]]. Bonobos are the only non-human animal to have been observed engaging in all of the following sexual activities: face-to-face [[genital sex]], [[tongue kiss]]ing, and [[oral sex]]<ref name=Manson1997>{{cite journal|author = Manson, J.H.|coauthors = Perry, S.; Parish, A.R.|year = 1997|title = Nonconceptive Sexual Behavior in Bonobos and Capuchins|journal = International Journal of Primatology|volume = 18|issue = 5|pages = 767<U+2013>86 |doi = 10.1023/A:1026395829818}}</ref>   (although a pair of Western Gorillas has been photographed performing face to face genital sex<ref>Tuan C. Nguyen, "Gorillas Caught in Very Human Act" in ''Live Science'' (February 13, 2008)</ref>).    In scientific literature, the female-female behavior of touching genitals together is often referred to as ''GG rubbing'' or ''genital-genital rubbing.'' The sexual activity happens within the immediate family as well as outside it. Bonobos do not form [[monogamy|permanent relationships]] with individual partners. They also do not seem to discriminate in their sexual behavior by sex or age, with the possible exception of abstaining from sexual intercourse between mothers and their adult sons; some observers believe these pairings are [[taboo]]. When Bonobos come upon a new food source or feeding ground, the increased excitement will usually lead to communal sexual activity, presumably decreasing tension and encouraging peaceful feeding.<ref name=songweaver>{{cite web|url= http://songweaver.com/info/bonobos.html|title= Bonobo Sex and Society|accessdate= 2006-07-17|author= Frans B. M. de Waal|authorlink= Frans de Waal |year= 1995|month= March|work= Scientific American|pages= 82<U+2013>8}}</ref>

Bonobo males occasionally engage in various forms of male-male genital behavior.<ref>Frans de Waal, "Bonobo Sex and Society" in ''Scientific American'' (March 1995), p. 82ff</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bio.davidson.edu/people/vecase/Behavior/Spring2004/laird/Social%20Organization.htm |title=Courtney Laird, "Social Organization" |publisher=Bio.davidson.edu |year=2004 |accessdate=2009-07-03}}</ref>    In one form, two males hang from a tree limb face-to-face while "penis fencing".<ref name=penisfencing>{{cite book|author= Frans B. M. de Waal |authorlink= Frans de Waal| title=The ape and the sushi master : cultural reflections by a primatologist|publisher=Basic Books|chapter=Bonobos and Fig Leaves|year= 2001|isbn= 8449313252}}</ref><ref name=FBMdW>{{cite journal|url = http://primate.uchicago.edu/DeWaalSciAm.doc|title = Bonobo Sex and Society|author = de Waal, Frans B.M.|journal = [[Scientific American]]|month = March|year = 1995|volume = 272|issue = 3}}</ref>    This also may occur when two males rub their penises together while in face-to-face position. Another form of genital interaction, called "rump rubbing", occurs to express reconciliation between two males after a conflict, when they stand back-to-back and rub their scrotal sacs together. Takayoshi Kano observed similar practices among Bonobos in the natural habitat.

Bonobo females also engage in female-female genital behavior, possibly to bond socially with each other, thus forming a female nucleus of Bonobo society. The bonding among females enables them to dominate Bonobo society. Although male Bonobos are individually stronger, they cannot stand alone against a united group of females.<ref name=FBMdW/>    Adolescent females often leave their native community to join another community. Sexual bonding with other females establishes these new females as members of the group. This migration mixes the Bonobo [[gene pool]]s, providing [[genetic diversity]].

Bonobo reproductive rates are not any higher than that of the Common Chimpanzee. Female Bonobos carry and nurse their young for five years and can give birth every five to six years. Compared to Common Chimpanzees, Bonobo females resume the genital swelling cycle much sooner after giving birth, enabling them to rejoin the sexual activities of their society. Also, Bonobo females who are sterile or too young to reproduce still engage in sexual activity.

===Closeness to humans===
Bonobos are capable of passing the [[mirror-recognition test for self-awareness]]. They communicate primarily through vocal means, although the meanings of their vocalizations are not currently known. However, most humans do understand their facial expressions<ref name= BonoboDNA/>    and some of their natural hand gestures, such as their invitation to play. Two Bonobos at the [[Great Ape Trust]], [[Kanzi]] and [[Panzee and Panbanisha|Panbanisha]], have been taught how to communicate using a keyboard labeled with [[lexigrams]] (geometric symbols) and they can respond to spoken sentences. Kanzi's vocabulary consists of more than 500 English words<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greatapetrust.org/bonobo/meet/kanzi.php|title=Meet our Great Apes: Kanzi|accessdate=2008-09-28 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080630201101/http://www.greatapetrust.org/bonobo/meet/kanzi.php <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-06-30}}</ref>    and he has comprehension of around 3,000 spoken English words.<ref>{{cite web|author=Raffaele, P. |year=2006|title=Speaking Bonobo|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/10022981.html|publisher=Smithsonian|accessdate=2008-09-28}}</ref> Kanzi has also been known for learning from observation of people trying to teach his mother.  His mother was not learning some things and Kanzi started doing the tasks that his mother was taught just by watching.    Some, such as [[philosopher]] and [[bioethics|bioethicist]] [[Peter Singer]], argue that these results qualify them for the "rights to survival and life", [[Great Ape personhood|rights]] that humans theoretically accord to all [[person]]s.

There are instances in which non-human primates have been reported to have expressed joy.

Around 10,000 Bonobos are found only south of the [[Congo River]] and north of the [[Kasai River]] (a tributary of the Congo),<ref name=ancestor>{{cite book |last=Dawkins |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Dawkins |title=The Ancestor's Tale |year=2004 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |chapter=Chimpanzees |isbn=115516265X}}</ref> in the humid forests of the [[Geography of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|Democratic Republic of Congo]] of central [[Africa]]. They are an [[endangered species]], due both to [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]] loss and hunting for [[bushmeat]], the latter activity having increased dramatically during the current civil war due to the presence of heavily armed militias even in remote "protected" areas such as [[Salonga National Park]]. Today, at most several thousand Bonobos remain. This is part of a more general trend of [[ape extinction]].

==Conservation efforts==

Since 1996, the [[First Congo War|first]] and [[Second Congo War|second Congo wars]] in the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] (DRC) have had a major impact on the Bonobo population. Bonobos are in danger of being hunted to extinction.

As the Bonobo's habitat is shared with people, the ultimate success of conservation efforts will rely on local and community involvement. The issue of parks vs. people,<ref>Reid, John, ''Parks and people, not parks vs. people'', ''San Francisco Chronicle'', June 15, 2006</ref> is very cogent in the [[Cuvette Centrale]], the Bonobo's range. There is strong local and broad-based Congolese resistance to establishing national parks, as indigenous communities often have been driven from their forest homes by the establishment of parks. In [[Salonga National Park]], the only national park in the Bonobo habitat, there is no local involvement, and recent surveys{{When|date=November 2009}} indicate that the Bonobo, the [[African Forest Elephant]], and other species have been severely devastated by [[Poaching|poachers]] and the thriving [[bushmeat]] trade. In contrast to this, there are areas where the Bonobo and biodiversity still thrive without any established parks, due to the indigenous beliefs and taboos against killing Bonobos.

The port town of [[Basankusu]] is situated on the [[Lulonga River]], at the confluence of the Lopori and Maringa Rivers, in the north of the country, making it well placed to receive and transport local goods to the cities of [[Mbandaka]] and [[Kinshasa]]. With [[Basankusu]] being the last port of substance before the wilderness of the Lopori Basin and the Lomako River <U+2013> the Bonobo heartland, conservation efforts for the Bonobo,<ref>[http://www.bonoboincongo.com/the-bonobo Searching for Bonobo <U+2013> Dr Therese Hart]</ref> use the town as a base.<ref>[http://lolayabonobo.wildlifedirect.org/ Lola Ya Bonobo (Bonobo Heaven)]</ref><ref>[http://www.friendsofbonobos.org/images/newsnov09.pdf Bonobo Reintroduction in the Democratic Republic of Congo]</ref>

In 1995, concern over declining numbers of Bonobos in the wild led the Zoological Society of Milwaukee in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, with contributions from Bonobo scientists around the world, to publish the Action Plan for Pan paniscus: A Report on Free Ranging Populations and Proposals for their Preservation. The Action Plan compiles population data on Bonobos from twenty years of research conducted at various sites throughout the Bonobo's range. The plan identifies priority actions for Bonobo conservation and serves as a reference for developing conservation programs for researchers, government officials, and donor agencies.

Acting on Action Plan recommendations, the ZSM developed the Bonobo and Congo Biodiversity Initiative (BCBI). This program includes habitat and rain-forest preservation, training for Congolese nationals and conservation institutions, wildlife population assessment and monitoring, and education. The Zoological Society has conducted regional surveys within the range of the Bonobo in conjunction with training Congolese researchers in survey methodology and biodiversity monitoring. The Zoological Society<U+2019>s initial goal was to survey Salonga National Park to determine the conservation status of the Bonobo within the park and to provide financial and technical assistance to strengthen park protection. As the project has developed, the Zoological Society has become more involved in helping the Congolese living in Bonobo habitat. The Zoological Society has built schools, hired teachers, provided some medicines, and, {{as of|2007|lc=on}}, started an agriculture project to help the Congolese learn to grow crops and depend less on hunting wild animals.

During the wars in the 1990s, researchers and international [[non-governmental organization]]s (NGOs) were driven out of the Bonobo habitat. In 2002, the [http://www.bonobo.org Bonobo Conservation Initiative] initiated the Bonobo Peace Forest Project in cooperation with national institutions, local NGOs, and local communities. The Peace Forest Project works with local communities to establish a linked constellation of community-based reserves, managed by local and indigenous people. Although there has been only limited support from international organizations, this model, implemented mainly through DRC organizations and local communities, has helped bring about agreements to protect over {{convert|5000|sqmi|km2}} of the Bonobo habitat. According to [http://www.loe.org/shows/shows.htm?programID=06-P13-00027#feature2 Dr. Amy Parish], the Bonobo Peace Forest "<U+2026>is going to be a model for conservation in the 21st century."<ref>"The Make Love, Not War Species", ''Living on Earth'', (July 2006), National Public Radio</ref>

This initiative has been gaining momentum and greater international recognition and it recently{{When|date=November 2009}} has gained greater support through [[Conservation International]], the [http://web.conservation.org/xp/gcf/ Global Conservation Fund], [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]]'s Great Ape Conservation Fund, and the United Nations' [[Great Apes Survival Project]].

With grants from the United Nations, USAID, the U.S. Embassy, the World Wildlife Fund, and many other groups and individuals, the Zoological Society also has been working to:
*Survey the Bonobo population and its habitat in order to find ways to help protect these apes.
*Develop anti-poaching measures to help save apes, forest elephants, and other endangered animals in Congo's Salonga National Park, a U.N. World Heritage Site.
*Provide training, literacy education, agricultural techniques, schools, equipment, and jobs for Congolese living near Bonobo habitats so that they will have a vested interest in protecting the great apes. {{As of|2007}}, the ZSM started an agriculture project to help the Congolese learn to grow crops and depend less on hunting wild animals.
*Model small-scale conservation methods that can be used throughout Congo.

Starting in 2003, the U.S. government allocated $54 million to the [http://www.cbfp.org/en/ Congo Basin Forest Partnership]. This significant investment has triggered the involvement of international NGOs to establish bases in the region and work to develop Bonobo conservation programs. This initiative should improve the likelihood of Bonobo survival, but its success still may depend upon building greater involvement and capability in local and indigenous communities.<ref>Chapin, Mac, (November/December 2004), Vision for a Sustainable World, WORLDWATCH magazine</ref>

The Congo is setting aside more than {{convert|11000|sqmi|km2}} of rain forest to help protect the endangered Bonobo, in this Central African country. U.S. agencies, conservation groups, and the Congolese government have come together to set aside {{convert|11803|sqmi|km2}} of tropical rain forest, the U.S.-based Bonobo Conservation Initiative. The area amounts to just over 1% of the vast Congo <U+2013> but that means a park larger than the state of Massachusetts.

The Bonobo population is believed to have declined sharply in the last thirty years, though surveys have been hard to carry out in war-ravaged central Congo. Estimates range from 60,000 to fewer than 50,000 living, according to the World Wildlife Fund.

The Sankuru reserve also contains [[Okapi]], closely related to the [[Giraffe]], that also is native to Congo, elephants, and at least ten other primate species.

In addition, concerned parties have addressed the crisis on several science and ecological websites. Organizations such as the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]], the [http://www.awf.org African Wildlife Foundation], and others are trying to focus attention on the extreme risk to the species. Some have suggested that a reserve be established in a more stable part of Africa, or on an island in a place such as Indonesia. Awareness is ever increasing and even non-scientific or ecological sites have created various groups to collect donations to help with the conservation of this species.
