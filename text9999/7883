'''Doctor of Canon Law''' ({{lang-la|'''Juris Canonici Doctor'''}}; '''J.C.D.''') is the [[doctoral]]-level [[terminal degree]] in the studies of [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. 

It may also be abbreviated '''I.C.D.''' or '''dr.iur.can.''' (''Iuris Canonici Doctor''), '''ICDr.''', '''D.C.L.''', '''D.Cnl.''', '''D.D.C.''', or '''D.Can.L.''' (''Doctor of Canon Law'').  Doctor of both laws (i.e. canon and civil) are [[J.U.D.]] (''Juris Utriusque Doctor''), or [[U.J.D.]] (''Utriusque Juris Doctor'').  

A doctorate in canon law normally requires at least two years of additional study and the development and defense of an original [[dissertation]] that contributes to the development of canon law after having earned the degree [[Licentiate of Canon Law]]. Only [[pontifical university|pontifical universities]] and ecclesiastical faculties of canon law may grant the doctorate or licentiate in canon law.  

The [[Licentiate of Canon Law]] is a three-year degree, the prerequisite for the study of which is normally the [[graduate school|graduate]] level [[bachelor of sacred theology]] ([[Bachelor of Sacred Theology|S.T.B.]]), a [[master of divinity]] ([[M.Div.]]), a [[Master of Arts (postgraduate)|master of arts]] in Roman Catholic theology ([[Master of Arts (postgraduate)|M.A.]]), or a civil law degree ([[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] or [[LL.B.]]) and a [[bachelor degree]] in canon law (J.C.B.) or its relative equivalent.  

While not a civil law degree, the doctor of canon law is in some ways comparable to the [[Doctor of Juridical Science]] ([[J.S.D.]]) or [[Legum Doctor|doctor of laws]] ([[LL.D.]]) in terms of the nature of study as they are terminal academic research degrees as opposed to professional degrees.

Members of the [[Supreme Tribunal of the Apostolic Signatura]], Auditors of the Tribunal of the [[Roman Rota]], [[judicial vicar]]s, [[ecclesiastical judge]]s, [[Defender_of_the_Matrimonial_Tie|defenders of the bond]], and [[promoters of justice]], must possess either a doctorate or license in canon law.  Either of the degrees is recommended for those who serve as [[vicar general]] or [[episcopal vicar]] in a diocese.  Candidates for [[bishop]] must either possess the doctorate in canon law or the doctorate in sacred theology or be truly expert in one of those fields. Canonical advocates must possess the doctorate or be truly expert.

The Roman Church has the oldest continuously used homogenous legal system in the world. Following the [[Gregorian Reform]]'s emphasis on [[canon law]], [[bishops]] formed cathedral schools to train the clergy in [[canon law]].  Consequently, many of the [[medieval universities]] of Europe founded faculties of canon law (e.g., [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] and [[University of Oxford|Oxford]]).  Since the [[Protestant Reformation]], however, they became limited to those universities which retained Catholic faculties (e.g.,  [[Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas (Angelicum)]], [[Gregorian University]], [[Old University of Leuven|Catholic University of Louvain]], [[Faculty of Canon Law "S. Pio X" in Venice]]). Other Catholic universities with ecclesiastical faculties in canon law were subsequently given the ability to grant the degree (e.g., [[The Catholic University of America]], [[Saint Paul University|University of Saint Paul]]). The [[University of Santo Tomas]] in [[Manila]], [[Philippines]], has been awarding the degree since 1734.
