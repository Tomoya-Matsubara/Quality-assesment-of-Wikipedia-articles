==Early life==
Werdyger is the youngest of four sons and four daughters born to Yisrael Aryeh Werdyger, a well-to-do wholesaler of men's shirts and dry goods and a prominent member of the Gerrer Hasidic community of [[Krak<U+00F3>w]], to which the family moved shortly after David's birth.<ref>Werdyger, ''Songs of Hope'', p. 56.</ref> The Werdyger family was known for its musical talent, and as a youngster, David's singing ability was readily apparent. At the age of six he became the soloist in the choir of the Eizik Yeikeles Synagogue in Krak<U+00F3>w,<ref>Werdyger, ''Songs of Hope'', p. 30.</ref> and at age 12 he was invited by [[Yankel Talmud]], the leader of the Gerrer choir, to be a soloist in that choir in the town of [[G<U+00F3>ra Kalwaria|Ger]]. On [[Rosh Hashana]], he sang before the Gerrer [[Rebbe]], the [[Avraham Mordechai Alter|Imrei Emes]], and thousands of Hasidim.<ref>Werdyger, ''Songs of Hope'', pp. 33&ndash;37.</ref> 

==Holocaust years==
With the [[Occupation of Poland (1939<U+2013>1945)|Nazi occupation of Poland]] in September 1939, Werdyger was subject to frequent arrests and forced labor on the streets of Krak<U+00F3>w. In the summer of 1940, when the Nazis ordered all Jews to leave the city, Werdyger's family moved to an uncle's home in Proshevitz.<ref>Werdyger, ''Songs of Hope'', p. 76.</ref> In response to rumors of a mass deportation, David, his unmarried sister Yettie, and his parents went into hiding with 16 others in a bunker in their uncle's warehouse, where they were cared for by a Polish employee.<ref>Werdyger, ''Songs of Hope'', p. 91.</ref> Three weeks later, they sneaked into the Padgursz ghetto of Krak<U+00F3>w.<ref>Werdyger, ''Songs of Hope'', p. 100.</ref> From there, his parents bought their way out of the ghetto into Sosnowice, where one of their married daughters was living. David never saw them again.<ref>Werdyger, ''Songs of Hope'', p. 111.</ref> 

In the ghetto, David worked in forced labor battalions, and when a mass deportation took place in the Padgursz ghetto, he went into hiding with 15 others. Two weeks later, his group was ferreted out of their hiding place and taken with 180 other ghetto residents to the [[Krak<U+00F3>w-P<U+0142>asz<U+00F3>w concentration camp]] to be shot by [[Execution by firing squad|firing squad]]. Each man passed before [[Nazism|Nazi]] camp commandant [[Amon G<U+00F6>th]]; when it was David's turn, G<U+00F6>th asked him what type of work he did. "I am a professional singer, and I have a trained soprano voice," Werdyger replied. "Would you like to hear something?" Momentarily taken aback, G<U+00F6>th replied, "Sing the song you Jews chant when you bury your dead." Werdyger began singing the traditional [[Prayer for the dead#Judaism|Jewish prayer for the dead]], ''El Molei Rachamim'' ("God, Full of Compassion"), with great feeling and power, ending with a thunderous "[[Amen]]." His voice so moved G<U+00F6>th that the commandant directed him to the camp rather than to the firing squad; he was one of the 40 men saved from execution that day.<ref>Werdyger, ''Songs of Hope'', pp. 120&ndash;139.</ref><ref name="stories">{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?ei=fXqwTbLrGsjGtAbSpoXyCw&ct=result&id=qrHXAAAAMAAJ&dq=dovid+werdyger&q=werdyger |pages=68&ndash;70 |title=Niggun: Stories behind the Chasidic songs that inspire Jews |last=Staiman |first=Mordechai |year=1994 |publisher=[[Jason Aronson]] |isbn=1568210477}}</ref>

Werdyger was an inmate in the P<U+0142>asz<U+00F3>w for five months, after which he was transferred to the nearby factory under the direction of Oskar Schindler.<ref>Werdyger, ''Songs of Hope'', p. 158.</ref><ref name="matzav">{{cite web |url= http://matzav.com/photos-mbd-celebrates-his-60th-birthday |title=Photos: MBD Celebrates His 60th Birthday |last=Alpert |first=Yair |date=18 April 2011 |accessdate=22 April 2011 |publisher=matzav.com}}</ref> He also spent time in the [[Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp]] and the [[Linz]] labor camp, where he was liberated on Saturday, 5 May 1945.<ref>Werdyger, ''Songs of Hope'', pp. 224&ndash;229.</ref>

==Hazzan and Hasidic singer==
After the war, Werdyger found his eldest brother, Yaakov Meir, and youngest sister, Yettie, still alive. He traveled to [[Makow|Makova]] to attend Yaakov Meir's wedding and was there introduced to Malka Godinger (1923&ndash;1980), daughter of Meir Godinger. They married shortly after.<ref>Werdyger, ''Songs of Hope'', p. 256.</ref> Several months later Werdyger and his wife left for [[Paris]], France, where their first son, Yisrael Aryeh, was born.<ref>Werdyger, ''Songs of Hope'', p. 260.</ref> Four years later, in February 1950, they sailed to New York.<ref>Werdyger, ''Songs of Hope'', p. 267.</ref>

The couple had three more sons in America: [[Mordechai Ben David|Mordechai]] (born 1951<ref name="matzav"/>), Chaim (born 1954), and [[Mendy Werdyger|Mendel]] (Mendy) (born 1959<ref name="NY">{{cite web |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/21/nyregion/21cantor.html?_r=1 |title=Bit by Electronic Bit, a Cantor<U+2019>s Voice Is Restored |last=Berger |first=Joseph |date=20 July 2010 |accessdate=22 April 2011 |work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref>).<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.geni.com/people/Malka-Werdyger/6000000008223629670 |title=Malka Werdyger (Godinger) (1923 - d.)  |publisher=Geni |accessdate=22 April 2011}}</ref> Werdyger encouraged his four young sons to sing with him in the recording studio and in concert.<ref name="razin">Razin, Refael (20 September 2010).

Upon arrival in New York, Werdyger began working as a hazzan in the Warshever Shul on Rivington Street; after a year he moved to the Chasam Sofer Shul on the [[Lower East Side]]. His fame as a hazzan spread, and he signed a contract with the New Lots Talmud Torah Shul, which was famous for the high-caliber hazzanim that it attracted. Within a few months of this appointment he began receiving invitations to appear in concert, and he performed before audiences of thousands in [[Chicago]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Pittsburgh]] and other cities. He also started training with a voice coach, who taught him how to create his own cantorial compositions.<ref>Werdyger, ''Songs of Hope'', pp. 269&ndash;274.</ref> During this time he also opened Werdyger Travel in Brooklyn.<ref>Werdyger, ''Songs of Hope'', p. 275.</ref>

Later, Werdyger moved to the Rabbi Meir Simcha Hakohein Shul in East Flatbush, headed by [[Chabad]] Rabbi [[Jacob J. Hecht]]. Rabbi Hecht tapped him to sing cantorial selections on his weekly radio program, ''Shema Yisrael'', which exposed Werdyger to even larger audiences. One Sunday, Rabbi Hecht advised him, "Reb David, there's only one way that you can make it in today's world of popular singers and children's choirs, You've got to make a record." In 1959, Werdyger went to a professional recording studio to record his first record, ''Tefillah L'David'', which sold out its first production. In 1960 Werdyger recorded another album, ''Mizmor LeDavid'', which was also favorably received.<ref>Werdyger, ''Songs of Hope'', pp. 279&ndash;281.</ref><ref name="razin"/>

After that, Werdyger started his own recording label, Aderet Records, to record Hasidic ''niggunim'' (melodies) which were unknown to non-Hasidic religious Jews in America. He asked Yankel Talmud to provide him with the best Gerrer melodies and released ''Songs of the Gerer Chassidim Loi Sevoishi'' in 1962. His next album, ''A Melitzer Oneg Shabbos'', introduced Melitzer ''niggunim'', including several tunes composed by the Melitzer Rebbe, Rabbi Yitzchak Horowitz, whom Werdyger met while vacationing in [[Miami]]. Werdyger's third album, ''A Gerer Melava Malka'', featuring a solo by his young son, Mordechai, sold over 30,000 copies.<ref>Werdyger, ''Songs of Hope'', pp. 282&ndash;285.</ref> Subsequently Werdyger recorded the ''niggunim'' of the Skulener Rebbe, Rabbi [[Eliezer Zusia Portugal]], on ''Skulaner Chassidic Nigunim Vol. 1'', and of the Bobover Rebbe, Rabbi [[Shlomo Halberstam]], on ''Bobover Niggunim''.<ref>Werdyger, ''Songs of Hope'', pp. 288&ndash;291.</ref>

Werdyger's successful albums led to concert appearances in the United States, Canada, and England, in which he sang both cantorial and Hasidic melodies. Unsure of how his repertoire would be received at a [[yeshiva]] [[benefit concert]] in [[London]], he requested accompaniment by a boys' choir. Forty boys accompanied him, and he discovered the value of adding child vocalists and soloists to his music. Thereafter he produced an album for the Boyaner Hasidim on which he and his son Mordechai sang together, accompanied by the Boyaner's men's choir.<ref>Werdyger, ''Songs of Hope'', pp. 292&ndash;294.</ref>

Werdyger continues to sing on albums produced by Aderet Records, including two ''Shabbos with the Werdygers'' collections produced by his son, Chaim.<ref name="razin"/> In 1997 he contributed cantorial renditions for the [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] documentary ''A Life Apart: Hasidism in America''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pbs.org/alifeapart/credits.html |title=A Life Apart: Hasidism In America &ndash; Credits |date=2007 |accessdate=22 April 2011 |publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service]]}}</ref>

==Personal==
Following the death of his wife in 1980, Werdyger remarried Sarah Wercberger, widow of Wolf Wercberger and daughter of Rabbi Osher Zelig Marton, a [[Beth din#Officers of a Beth din|dayan]] and [[shochet]] in pre-war [[Romania]].<ref>Werdyger, ''Songs of Hope'', p. 304.</ref>

In 1993 Werdyger published his autobiography, ''Songs of Hope'', as part of the Holocaust Diaries series published by CIS Publishers.<ref>{{cite book |title=Songs of Hope |last=Werdyger |first=Duvid |year=1993 |place=Lakewood, N.J. |publisher=CIS Publishers |isbn=1560622261}}</ref>
