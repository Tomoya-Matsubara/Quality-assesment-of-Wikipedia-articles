'''"A Song for Simeon"''' is a 37-line poem written in 1928 by American-English poet [[T.&nbsp;S. Eliot]] (1888<U+2013>1965). It is [[T. S. Eliot's Ariel poems|one of five poems]] that Eliot contributed to the ''[[Ariel poems (Faber)|Ariel poems]]'' series of 38 pamphlets by several authors published by [[Faber and Faber|Faber and Gwyer]]. "A Song for Simeon" was the sixteenth in the series and included an illustration by [[avant garde]] artist [[Edward McKnight Kauffer]].<ref name="ArielSimeon1928">Eliot, T.&nbsp;S. "A Song for Simeon" in Ariel 16. (London: Faber and Faber, 1928).</ref> The poems, including "A Song for Simeon", were later published in both the 1936 and 1963 editions of Eliot's collected poems.<ref name="TSECollectedPoems">Eliot, T.&nbsp;S.

(London: Faber and Faber; New York: Harcourt Brace, 1963).</ref>

In 1927, Eliot had converted to [[Anglo-Catholicism]] and his poetry, starting with the ''Ariel Poems'' (1927<U+2013>31) and ''[[Ash Wednesday]]'' (1930), took on a decidedly religious character.<ref name="TimmermanTSEArielPoems">Timmerman, John H. ''T.&nbsp;S. Eliot's Ariel Poems: The Poetics of Recovery''. (Lewisburg, Pennsylvania: Bucknell University Press, 1994), 117<U+2013>123.</ref> "A Song for Simeon" is seen by many critics and scholars as a discussion of the conversion experience. In the poem, Eliot retells the story of [[Simeon (Gospel of Luke)|Simeon]] from the second chapter of the [[Gospel of Luke]], a just and devout Jew who encounters [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]], [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]] and the infant Jesus entering the [[Temple of Jerusalem]]. Promised by the [[Holy Ghost]] that he would not die until he had seen the Saviour, Simeon sees in the infant Jesus the [[Messiah]] promised by the Lord and asks God to permit him to "depart in peace" ({{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Luke|chapter=2|verse=25|range=<U+2013>35}}).

The poem's narrative echoes the text of the ''[[Nunc dimittis]]'', a liturgical prayer for [[Compline]] derived from the Gospel passage. Eliot introduces literary allusions to earlier writers [[Lancelot Andrewes]], [[Dante Alighieri]] and [[St. John of the Cross]]. Several critics have debated whether Eliot's depiction of Simeon is a negative portrayal of a Jewish figure and evidence of [[anti-Semitism]] on Eliot's part.

In 1925, Eliot became a poetry editor at the London publishing firm of Faber and Gwyer, Ltd.,<ref name="MurphyTSECompanion">Murphy, Russell Elliott. ''Critical Companion to T.&nbsp;S. Eliot: A Literary Reference to His Life and Work''.

(editor) ''The Annotated Waste Land with Eliot's Contemporary Prose'' (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2005), 9ff.</ref> In these years, Eliot gravitated away from his [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] upbringing and began to embrace the [[Church of England]]. He was [[baptism|baptised]] into the Anglican faith on 29 June 1927 at [[Finstock]], in [[Oxfordshire]], and was [[Confirmation|confirmed]] the following day in the private chapel of [[Thomas Banks Strong]], [[Bishop of Oxford]].<ref name="MurphyTSECompanion" />{{rp|pp.18}}<ref name="GordonTSEImperfectLife">Gordon, Lyndell.

Retrieved 24 October 2013.</ref> When his [[Religious conversion|conversion]] became known, it was "an understandable choice to those around him" given his intellectual convictions, and that "he could not have done anything less than seek what he regarded as the most ancient, most sacramental, and highest expression of the Christian faith that forms the indisputable basis for the culture and civilization of modern Europe".<ref name="MurphyTSECompanion" />{{rp|pp.18}} Eliot's conversion and his adherence to [[Anglo-Catholicism]] informed and influenced his later poetry.<ref name="TimmermanTSEArielPoems" /> 

Critical reviews of Eliot's poems shifted as well, with some critics asserting that Eliot's work suffered with the addition of Christian themes.<ref>Kirk, Russell. ''Eliot and His Age: T. S. Eliot's Moral Imagination in the Twentieth Century.'' (Wilmington: Isi Books, 2008), 240. Kirk, in his discussion, mentions the critique of George Orwell as one of the more prominent positions on Eliot's development. Orwell said: "It is clear that something has departed, some kind of current has been switched off, the later verse does not contain the earlier, even if it is claimed as an improvement upon it [...] He does not really feel his faith, but merely assents to it for complex reasons. It does not in itself give him any fresh literary impulse."</ref> One critic, Morton Zabel said that this "deprived his art of its once incomparable distinction in style and tone".<ref>Zabel, Morton D. "T.&nbsp;S. Eliot in Mid-Career," in ''Poetry'' (September 1931): 36:330<U+2013>337.</ref> Other critics thought Eliot's exploration of Christian themes was a positive development in his poetry, including Gordon Symes, who recognised it as "an evaluation of old age, an elucidation of its special grace, and an appreciation of its special function in the progress of the soul".<ref>Symes, Gordon.

In 1927, Eliot was asked by his employer, [[Geoffrey Faber]], to write one poem each year for a series of illustrated pamphlets with holiday themes to be sent to the firm's clients and business acquaintances as Christmas greetings.<ref name="MurphyTSECompanion" />{{rp|pp.19,50,376}} This series, called the [[Ariel poems (Faber)|"Ariel Series"]], consisted of 38 [[pamphlet]]s published between 1927 and 1931 featuring poems and brief prose from a selection of English writers and poets.

==Analysis==
"A Song for Simeon" is a 37-line poem written in [[free verse]]. The poem does not have a consistent pattern of [[Meter (poetry)|meter]]. The lines range in length from three syllables to fifteen syllables. Eliot uses [[end rhyme]] sporadically in 21 lines of the poem, specifically:<ref name="ArielSimeon1928" /><ref name="TSECollectedPoems" />

* ''and'', ''hand'', ''stand'', and ''land'' (in lines 1, 3, 5, 7) 
* ''poor'' and ''door'' (lines 10 and 12)
* ''sorrow'' and ''to-morrow'' (lines 20 and 24)
* ''derision'' and ''vision'' (lines 27 and 30)
* ''stair'' and ''prayer'' (lines 28 and 29)
* ''heart'' and ''depart'' (lines 32 and 36)

Eliot's use of ''lamentation'', ''desolation'' and ''consolation''<U+2014>a repetition of the two-syllable ''-ation'' ending<U+2014>is an example of [[Syllable#Structure#Rime|syllable rhyme]]. Eliot employs [[Rhyme#Types of rhyme#General rhymes|forced rhyme]] (also called "oblique rhyme") on ''peace'' and ''ease'' (lines 8 and 11), and [[eye rhyme]] on ''home'' and ''come'' (lines 14 and 15).<ref name="ArielSimeon1928" /><ref name="TSECollectedPoems" />

"A Song for Simeon" is structured as a first-person [[dramatic monologue]] spoken by Simeon.<ref name="JuliusTSEAntisemitism">Julius, Anthony.

===Gospel narrative and the ''Nunc dimittis''===
Most scholars and critics addressing the poem focus on the Gospel narrative for a source of interpretation as Eliot's poem quotes several lines verbatim from the passage in Luke, from the ''Nunc dimittis''. Scofield says that the poem is "characterized by deliberately Biblical language, interwoven with actual phrases from the Gospels".<ref name="ScofieldTSEPoems" />{{rp|p.147}}<ref>Pinion, F. B. ''A T.&nbsp;S. Eliot Companion''. (New York: Macmillan, 1986), 173.</ref>

The subject of Eliot's poem is drawn from the second chapter of the Gospel of Luke ({{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Luke|chapter=2|verse=25|range=<U+2013>35}}), and the early Christian [[canticle]] ''[[Nunc dimittis]]'' derived from it.<ref name="SchneiderTSEPattern">Schneider, Elisabeth Wintersteen.

(London: Faber and Faber, 1994), 240<U+2013>241.</ref> Luke states that Simeon is "waiting for the consolation of Israel" after being promised that "he should not see death before he had seen the Lord's Christ". ({{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Luke|chapter=2|verse=25|range=<U+2013>26}}) Simeon, upon seeing the child, takes him into his arms and prays, prophesizing the redemption of the world by Jesus and of suffering to come.<ref name="SchneiderTSEPattern" /><ref name="SouthamTSEPoemsGuide" /> This prayer would become known later as the ''Nunc dimittis'' from its Latin [[incipit]].<ref name="CathEncycNuncDimittis">Henry, Hugh. [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11159a.htm "Nunc Dimittis (The Canticle of Simeon)"], ''The Catholic Encyclopedia'', Vol. 11. (New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911).

<blockquote>
<poem>
Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace : according to thy word.
For mine eyes have seen : thy salvation,
Which thou hast prepared : before the face of all people;

</poem></blockquote>

The ''Nunc dimittis'' is the traditional "Gospel Canticle" of Night Prayer that is often called the ''Song of Simeon'' or ''Canticle of Simeon''. In the [[Roman Catholic]] tradition, it was used during the Office for [[Compline]], the last of the [[Canonical hours]], in the [[Liturgy of the Hours]].<ref name="CathEncycNuncDimittis" /> The Anglican tradition combined liturgy of the Catholic offices of [[Vespers]] (especially with the ''[[Magnificat]]'' canticle) and Compline (with the ''Nunc dimittis'') into [[Evening Prayer (Anglican)|Evening Prayer]] when compiling the ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]'' during the [[English Reformation]].<ref>Cummings, Brian (editor).

In 1886, Eliot's grandfather, [[William Greenleaf Eliot]], an American educator and Unitarian minister, wrote a poem titled "Nunc dimittis".  Written a few months before his death (and two years before T.&nbsp;S. Eliot's birth,) the elder Eliot's poem used the same gospel text and the poet asks, in his decline, "When may I humbly claim that kind award, / And cares and labors cease?"<ref name="SouthamTSEPoemsGuide" /><ref>Eliot, William Greenleaf.

Scholars have identified allusions by Eliot to other biblical passages, including:
* "Before the stations of the mountain of desolation" in line 19 and the reference to "the fox's home" in line 15 as a reference to [[Calvary]] ([[Golgotha]]), or to {{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Lamentations|chapter=5|verse=17|range=<U+2013>18}} "the mountain of zion&nbsp;... is desolate, the foxes walk upon it". The fox reference is also thought to be connected to {{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Mark|chapter=13|verse=14}}, and {{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Mark|chapter=8|verse=20}}.<ref name="SouthamTSEPoemsGuide" />
* The stations in line 19, and the time of cords, scourges and lamentation in line 17 refers to Christ's passion and crucifixion, in particular his scourging at the orders of Pontius Pilate and the lamenting of women along the [[Via Dolorosa]] described in {{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Luke|chapter=33|verse=27|range=<U+2013>29}}.<ref name="SouthamTSEPoemsGuide" />
* "The goat's path" of line 15, is a reference to the scapegoat of {{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Leviticus|chapter=16|verse=22}}.<ref name="SouthamTSEPoemsGuide" />
* "Fleeing from foreign faces and the foreign swords" is from prophesies of grief, hiding and pursuit in {{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Isaiah|chapter=51|verse=3}}, and crucifixion events mentioned in {{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Mark|chapter=13|verse=8}}, {{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Matthew|chapter=24|verse=8}}.

===Conversion===
[[File:Lancelot Andrewes by Simon de Passe 1618.jpg|thumb|right|Eliot was influenced by an [[Ash Wednesday]] sermon (1619) of Anglican divine Lancelot Andrewes (pictured) that emphasised conversion as an act of turning toward God.|alt="Portrait of Lancelot Andrewes"]]
"A Song for Simeon" is not considered by scholars and critics to be one of Eliot's significant poems. It is thus overshadowed by his comparatively better known works of the period<U+2014>"[[The Hollow Men]]" (1925), written before his conversion; and "The Journey of the Magi" (1927), "[[Ash Wednesday]]" (1930), and the later, more substantial ''[[Four Quartets]]'' (1943), written after his conversion. However, in "A Song for Simeon" and these poems, Eliot continues the progression of his themes of alienation in a changing world, and fuses with this the tenets of his newfound faith.<ref name="MaddreyTSELitInfluences">Maddrey, Joseph. ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=kNZ3xBc_620C&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false The Making of T.&nbsp;S. Eliot: A Study of the Literary Influences]''. (Jefferson, North Carolina: MacFarland & Company, 2009), 147<U+2013>148.</ref> Scofield states that the imagery of "A Song for Simeon"<U+2014>including the symbol of a feather, its setting amid Roman hyacinths and the winter sun<U+2014>conveys "a sense of wonder and fragile new life".<ref name="ScofieldTSEPoems" />{{rp|p.147}}. The Reverend Robin Griffith-Jones, an Anglican cleric, draws a connection between Eliot's image of the feather to a statement by [[Hildegard of Bingen]] comparing herself "to 'a feather which lacks all weight and strength and flies through the wind'; so she was borne up by God. But Eliot's speaker, still waiting for the wind to blow, imagines only the death wind that will bear him away".<ref name="Griffith-JonesChurchTimes" /> 

According to writer Joseph Maddrey, "A Song for Simeon" shares themes with his more famous conversion poem "Ash Wednesday", the first parts of which Eliot was writing when "A Song for Simeon" was written and published. Eliot uses the biblical story of Simeon to illustrate the "contrast between appearance and reality and humbly begs God to teach him the stillness that unifies the two".<ref name="MaddreyTSELitInfluences" /> Eliot's Ariel poems and "Ash Wednesday" explore this new experience of conversion and the progress of the soul.<ref name="WilliamsonTSEGuide">Williamson, George.

Simeon wants nothing of this "time of sorrow" and that the fate of persecution for the consequences of faith is not for him.<ref name="ArielSimeon1928" />{{rp|l.14}}<ref name="WilliamsonTSEGuide" />{{rp|pp.166<U+2013>167}}

According to Eliot biographer [[Lyndall Gordon]], in "Ash Wednesday" and the Ariel poems, "Eliot wonders if he does not belong to those who espouse Christianity officially without being properly committed, whose ostentatious piety is 'tainted with a self-conceit.'"<ref name="GordonTSEImperfectLife" />{{rp|p.225}} The poem is inherently tied to Eliot's religious conversion experience, and connected to Eliot's reading of Anglican divine [[Lancelot Andrewes]] during this time.<ref>"Lancelot Andrewes". Times Literary Supplement, London, 1286 (23 September 1926) [621]-622</ref> Andrewes, in an 1619 Ash Wednesday sermon, emphasised that conversion "must come from both mind and heart, thought and feeling, 'the principall{{sic}} and most proper act of a true turning to God.'"<ref name="MaddreyTSELitInfluences" /><ref>Andrewes, Lancelot. [http://anglicanhistory.org/lact/andrewes/v1/wednesday4.html "SERMON IV. Preached before King James, at Whitehall, on Wednesday, the Tenth of February, A.D. MDCXIX."] (on Joel ii. 12, 13.). Retrieved 24 October 2013.</ref> Andrewes' words are channelled again, when Eliot's Simeon "sees a faith that he cannot inhabit in "the still unspeaking and unspoken Word'".<ref name="Griffith-JonesChurchTimes" /> Eliot uses the image of the winding staircase<U+2014>an image that also appears in "Ash Wednesday"<U+2014>which Gordon indicates is a direct reference to Andrewes' sermon. According to Gordon, "Eliot's penitent&nbsp;... 'turning on the winding stair', acts out the two mental turns Andrewes prescribed for a conversion: a turn that looks forward to God and a turn that looks backward to one<U+2019>s sins, sentencing oneself for the past".<ref name="GordonTSEImperfectLife" />{{rp|p.224}}

The image of a winding stair has also been tied to scenes in Dante's journey from [[Purgatory]] to [[Paradise]] in the ''[[Divine Comedy]]''.<ref name="CavallaroVirgil">Cavallaro, Daniela. "A Song for Virgil: Dantean References in Eliot's 'A Song for Simeon'", ''Journal of Modern Literature'' 24(2) (Winter 2000/2001), 349<U+2013>352.</ref> Further, the image is thought associated with stairs as the path of mystical ascent in the writings of sixteenth-century [[Spanish mystics|Spanish mystic]] [[Saint John of the Cross]].<ref name="Griffith-JonesChurchTimes" /><ref>Unger, Leonard. ''T.&nbsp;S. Eliot: Moments and Patterns''. (University of Minnesota Press, 1966), 167.</ref> Eliot often alludes to this symbol in several of his poems.<ref name="ScofieldTSEPoems" />{{rp|pp.209<U+2013>211}}

Eliot's Simeon appears similar to Dante's depiction of [[Virgil]] in the ''Divine Comedy'', as "the seer who can see only so far; the precursor who cannot enter the world that he makes possible".<ref name="Griffith-JonesChurchTimes" /> Virgil, in the ''Divine Comedy'', leads Dante through Hell (''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'') and Purgatory (''[[Purgatorio]]''), but cannot guide him into Paradise (''[[Paradiso (Dante)|Paradiso]]''). In this context, Virgil was a symbol of non-Christian philosophy and humanities could not help Dante any further in his approach to God.<ref>Kirkpatrick, Robin. ''Purgatorio''. (New York: Penguin, 2007), notes on Canto XXX and XXXI.</ref>  In Eliot's depiction, Simeon will never know the Christian culture he prophesizes, sensing "the birth-pangs of a world that he will never occupy".<ref name="Griffith-JonesChurchTimes" /><ref name="CavallaroVirgil" />

===Arguments over anti-Semitism===
[[File:Aert de Gelder - Het loflied van Simeon.jpg|thumb|right|[[Aert de Gelder]]'s early 18th-century painting ''Het loflied van Simeon'' (Simeon's song of praise)|alt="Image of an old man, Simeon, raising baby Jesus into the air in an act of praise"]] 
Eliot's poems have frequently been examined for instances of [[Anti-Semitism]]<U+2014>[[prejudice]] or discrimination against [[Jews]]. Scholar Louis Menard states that while Simeon is treated respectfully by Eliot, his characterisation is "in the tradition of Christian condescension toward the virtuous heathen".<ref>Menard, Louis. ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=HIHz3NAQVOUC&pg=PT70&dq=Eliot+anti-semitism&hl=en&sa=X&ei=xpZqUpgT0IuQB7_vgHg&ved=0CDkQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=Simeon&f=false American Studies]''. (New York: Farrar, Straus & Giroux, 2002), n.p.</ref>  Comparatively, [[Craig Raine]], a poet and [[New College, Oxford]] [[emeritus professor]] who wrote a book-length defence of Eliot against the claims of deliberate anti-Semitism, argues that "A Song for Simeon" provides a sympathetic discussion of the Jewish diaspora.<ref>Raine, Craig. ''In Defence of T.&nbsp;S. Eliot''. (London/New York: Pan Macmillan, 2011); and specifically in ''T.&nbsp;S. Eliot''. (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006), 173<U+2013>174.</ref> [[University of British Columbia]] scholar John Xiros Cooper states that the accusations of anti-Semitism lodged against Eliot rest "on a few isolated lines of poetry" and a passing reference in one prose text.<ref>Cooper, John Xiros. "Anti-Semitism" in Harding, Jason (editor). ''T.&nbsp;S. Eliot in Context''. (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2001), 287.</ref> Indeed, Eliot denied the claim, declaring, "I am not an anti-Semite and never have been. It is a terrible slander on a man."<ref>Eliot as quoted in Levy, William Turner and Scherle, Victor. ''Affectionately T.&nbsp;S. Eliot: The Story of a Friendship, 1947<U+2013>1965''. (London: J.M. Dent, 1968), 81.</ref> Political theorist and author [[Leonard Woolf]], who was both Jewish and one of Eliot's close friends, believed that Eliot was "slightly anti-Semitic in the sort of vague way which is not uncommon. He would have denied it genuinely."<ref name="RicksEliotPrejudice">Ricks, Christopher. ''T.&nbsp;S. Eliot and Prejudice''. (London: Faber, 1988).</ref>{{rp|p.62}}

[[Anthony Julius]], a British lawyer who is one of Eliot's most trenchant critics on this issue, writes that "A Song for Simeon" is "exceptional in a poetry in which elsewhere Jews are dumb. The voice, however is a disciplined one and speaks lines prepared for it&nbsp;... The song is ''for'', not ''of'' Simeon. Eliot gives the Jew lines that locate him, and by implication all Jews, wholly within the Christian drama. Incapable of denying its truth, but equally incapable of living that truth."<ref name="JuliusTSEAntisemitism" />{{rp|pp.70<U+2013>71}}  He accuses Eliot of animating "the [[Literary topos|topoi]] of the Jew acknowledging his obsolescence"<U+2014>essentially employing a tired characterisation of a Jewish figure as a voice attesting that Jews have no role in the Christian future.<ref name="JuliusTSEAntisemitism" />{{rp|pp.30,70<U+2013>71}}  Julius compares Simeon to [[Moses]] stating that he is "fated to see the [[Promised Land]] but not to enter it...witness to its truth, but denied its redemptive power, the Jew stands solemnly, humbly, outside Christianity's gates". Further, Julius draws on a quote from Eliot's earlier poem "Gerontion" to say that in this Christian future the Jews "may find a ledge there to squat on".<ref name="JuliusTSEAntisemitism" />{{rp|pp.70<U+2013>71}} 

Julius' view is considered extreme by many critics.<ref name="MeyerDeshenJewishHermeneutics" />{{rp|p.203,fn.35}} Comparatively, Julius tempered his harsh criticism by claiming that Eliot's anti-Semitism does not detract from the poetry and that it offers a creative force showing rare imaginative power to Eliot's art.<ref name="JuliusTSEAntisemitism" />{{rp|pp.28,33,35}}  Literary critic and professor [[Christopher Ricks]] agreed, citing the wit and commentary of Eliot's depictions of Jews; he asserts that Eliot was at his most brilliant in his prejudice.<ref name="GordonTSEImperfectLife" />{{rp|p.104}}<ref name="RicksEliotPrejudice" />{{rp|p.72}}
