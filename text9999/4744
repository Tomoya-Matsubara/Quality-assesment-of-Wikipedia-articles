'''Livingston''' is a [[Township (New Jersey)|township]] in [[Essex County, New Jersey|Essex County]], [[New Jersey]], United States. As of the [[2010 United States Census]], the township's population was 29,366,<ref name=APP2010/><ref name=Census2010/><ref name=Districts2011/><ref name=LWD2010/> reflecting an increase of 1,975 (+7.2%) from the 27,391 counted in the [[2000 United States Census|2000 Census]], which had in turn increased by 782 (+2.9%) from the 26,609 counted in the [[1990 United States Census|1990 Census]].<ref>[http://lwd.dol.state.nj.us/labor/lpa/census/2010/2010data/table7cm.xls Table 7.

Livingston was incorporated as a township by an Act of the [[New Jersey Legislature]] on February 5, 1813, from portions of Caldwell Township (now [[Fairfield Township, Essex County, New Jersey|Fairfield Township]]) and [[Springfield Township, Union County, New Jersey|Springfield Township]] (now in [[Union County, New Jersey]]). Portions of the township were taken to form [[Fairmount, New Jersey|Fairmount]] (March 11, 1862, now part of [[West Orange, New Jersey|West Orange]]) and [[Roseland, New Jersey|Roseland]] (March 10, 1908).<ref name=Story>Snyder, John P.

Accessed July 18, 2012.</ref>

The township was named for [[William Livingston]], the first [[Governor of New Jersey]], with his family's [[coat of arms]] as its seal.<ref>[http://www.livingstonnj.org/livingstonhistory.htm About Livingston]. Accessed March 9, 2007.</ref>

==History==
Livingston's history dates back to 1699 when 101 [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]] settlers wanted to move westward. They set up a committee to negotiate from [[Lenape|Lenni Lenape]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] for the purchase of the [[Horseneck Tract]] which today includes Livingston and eight other municipalities to the north. Between 1698 and 1702, the rules for property ownership were unclear. There were many disputes between settlers and the English [[Proprietary colony|proprietors]]. For some unknown reasons, the Newark settlers did not obtain a grant from the proprietors before negotiating with the [[Native Americans in the United States|natives]]. They finally obtained the [[deed]] directly from Lenni Lenape in 1702 for <U+00A3>130. The settlements began until around 1740s as the dispute between the proprietors and the settlers continued.<ref>James Hoyt, [http://www.archive.org/stream/themountainsoci00hoyt#page/43/mode/1up The Mountain society:" a history of the First Presbyterian Church, Orange, N. J.], ''New York, C. M. Saxton, Barker'', 1860, p.43</ref>

The dispute came to a breaking point in September 1745 when the [[East Jersey]] proprietors began to evict a settler only six months after a house fire in Newark completely destroyed the original deed, which was the only evidence of the purchase.<ref>Max K. Vorwerk, [http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~genepool/njriots.htm A History of the Horseneck Riots], ''Caldwell Bicentennial Committee, Caldwell, NJ'', 1948</ref> During that period, William Livingston who was one of the few landed [[Aristocracy|aristocrats]] joined the settlers against the proprietors. Livingston owned land around today's south western corner of the Township of Livingston. His land, like other settlers, was levied with [[Quit-rent|quit rents]] in the amount 40 [[shilling]]s per acre. He defended many settlers who were jailed for refusing to pay the quit rents.<ref>Livingston Township's Namesake: William Livingston, First Governor of New Jersey, ''West Essex Tribune'', August 25, 2011, p.B-8</ref>

This series of events caused the settlers, led by Timothy Meeker, to form a group to riot against the British government. The Horseneck Riots lasted for 10 years from 1745 to 1755. The group was also one of the first [[Militia (United States)|colonial militia]] which had periodic battles for 32 years leading up to the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] as the group joined the [[Continental Army]] in 1776.<ref name="tribune20090827">A Brief History Of Livingston, New Jersey, ''West Essex Tribune'', August 27, 2009, p.A-10</ref>

After the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]], more permanent settlements took place with the first school built in 1783. In 1811, a petition was filed to incorporate the township from about 100 people who lived in seven distinct areas: Centerville (separated to become [[Roseland, New Jersey|Roseland]], in 1908), Cheapside (now [[Livingston Mall]]), Morehousetown (now Livingston Circle), Northfield (now Northfield Center), Squiretown (now the Cerebral Palsy Institute of New Jersey on Old Road), Teedtown (now Livingston Center), and Washington Place (now near the border with [[Millburn, New Jersey|Millburn]]). On February 5, 1813, the township was officially incorporated. The first town meeting was held on the same day and they decided to run the township by a [[Township (New Jersey)|Township Committee]] system.

During the 1800s, [[lumber]] and [[farming]] were major industries in the town. [[Shoemaking]] and [[dairy]] became major industries during and after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] respectively. However, the population grew slowly because it was not easily accessible. Mt. Pleasant Avenue <U+2013> which was one of the first [[Toll road|turnpikes]] in New Jersey <U+2013> was the only primary access to the town through [[stagecoach]]es.

The population grew quickly after the 1920s when automobiles became more accessible. As a suburb of Newark, the town experienced many housing developments especially after [[World War II]] with its peak in 1970 of more than thirty thousand residents. During this growth period, many services were organized including volunteer Fire Department in 1922, first regular [[Livingston Police Department|Livingstone Police]] chief in 1929, a Planning Commission in 1930, two hospitals opened in 1959 and 1960, new public library in 1961, and new municipal complex in 1963.

The last surviving [[Harrison Cider Apple]] tree, the most famous of the 18th century Newark cider apples<ref>{{cite book|last=[[William Coxe]]|title=A View of the Cultivation of Fruit Trees and the Management of Orchards and Cider|location=Philadelphia|year=1817}}</ref> was rescued from extinction in 1976 in Livingston.<ref>McManus, Fran. [http://www.foggyridgecider.com/media/Edible-Jersey-Fall_2010.pdf "Lost & Found; The rise, fall and rebirth of the Harrison cider apple"], ''Edible Jersey'', Fall 2010. Accessed August 5, 2013. "In September 1976, Paul Gidez, an orchardist and fruit collector from Vermont, came to Essex County to search for the Harrison apple. Stopping at a bagel shop, he asked if there were any old cider mills in the area. He was directed to Nettie Ochs Cider Mill in Livingston, where he found a large Harrison tree that, according to the owner, had been planted around the turn of the century."</ref>

Today, some 28,000 people enjoy a suburban lifestyle with close proximity to New York City. Its school system and other programs have been drawing new residents to the town. Its population has become increasingly diverse while the residents maintain the tradition of community volunteerism.<ref name="tribune20090827"/><ref>[http://www.livingstonnj.org/livingstonhistory.htm Livingston History], Township of Livingston.

Livingston was the home of one of New Jersey's most prominent political families, the Keans.  [[Robert Kean]] served in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] from 1939 to 1958, when he ran for U.S. Senator; his son, [[Thomas Kean]], who served in the [[New Jersey General Assembly]] from 1968 to 1978 (and as Assembly Speaker in 1972<U+2013>73, and Minority Leader 1974<U+2013>77), as [[Governor of New Jersey]] from 1982 to 1990, and as President of [[Drew University]] from 1990 to 2004.  [[Thomas Kean Jr.]], elected to the State Assembly in 2001 and the State Senate in 2003, was the Republican nominee for United States Senator in 2006.

When Robert Kean ran for the Senate, losing to [[Harrison A. Williams]] in 1958, Livingston's Congressman became [[George M. Wallhauser]], a Republican. In redistricting after the 1960 census, Livingston was moved into the district of Republican Congresswoman [[Florence P. Dwyer]].  After redistricting following the 1970 census, Livingston went into Congressman [[Peter Frelinghuysen, Jr.]]'s district.  He was the father of Livingston's current Congressman, [[Rodney P. Frelinghuysen]].  When Peter Frelinghuysen retired in 1974, he was succeeded by [[Millicent Fenwick]], who beat Tom Kean in a Republican primary by about 80 votes.  After the 1980 census, Livingston was moved to Congressman [[Joseph G. Minish]]'s district.  Minish was defeated by [[Dean Gallo]] in 1984 and served until his death in 1994.  Rodney Frelinghuysen took his seat.  The 2000 Census split the town, and now Congressman [[Bill Pascrell]] represents a portion of the community.

Essex County Freeholders from Livingston have included Reita Greenstone, James Cavanaugh, Patricia Sebold, and William Clark.
