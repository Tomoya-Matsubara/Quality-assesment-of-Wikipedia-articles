'''''Free Society''''' (1895-1897 as '''''The Firebrand'''''; 1897-1904 as ''Free Society'') was a major [[Anarchism|anarchist]] newspaper in the [[United States]] at the end of the nineteenth and beginning of the twentieth centuries.<ref name="Goldman-MSF-551">"''Free Society'' was the principal English-language forum for anarchist ideas in the United States at the beginning of the twentieth century." ''Emma Goldman: Making Speech Free, 1902-1909'', p.551.</ref> Most anarchist publications in the US were in Yiddish, German, or Russian, but ''Free Society'' was published in English, permitting the dissemination of anarchist thought to English-speaking populations in the US.<ref  name="Goldman-MSF-551" />

The newspaper was established as ''The Firebrand'' in 1895 in [[Portland, Oregon]] by the Isaak family, [[Abe Isaak]], [[Mary Isaak]], and their children, along with some associates; the organization served as "the headquarters of anarchist activity on the [West] Coast".<ref>Emma Goldman, ''Living My Life'' (Volume 1), pp.224-225.</ref> The publication staunchly advocated [[free love]] and [[women's rights]], and critiqued "[[Comstockery]]" -- censorship of sexual information.  Deliberately defying "Comstockism" in an act of [[civil disobedience]], ''The Firebrand'' published [[Walt Whitman]]'s "A Woman Waits for Me" in 1897; [[A.J. Pope]], Abe Isaak, and [[Henry Addis]] were quickly arrested and charged with publishing obscene information for the Whitman poem and a letter "It Depends on the Women", signed by A.E.K. The A.E.K. letter presented various hypotheticals of women refusing or assenting to sex with their husbands or lovers, and argued that true liberation required education of both sexes and particularly women.<ref name="Moran-2004">Moran, 2004.</ref> 

After Isaak was released, the Isaak family moved the publication to [[San Francisco, California]], and resumed publication under the name ''Free Society''. However, while ''Free Society'' continued to discuss free love and advocate for equality of the sexes, it did not openly defy the Comstock laws again.<ref name="Moran-2004" />

The paper was particularly known for its advocacy of [[free love]], bringing an anarchist critique to bear on social relations and [[women's rights]].<ref name="Moran-2004" />
