'''''Californication''''' is the seventh studio album by [[United States|American]] [[rock music|rock]] band [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]]. Released on [[June 8]], [[1999]] (''see [[1999 in music]]'') on the [[Warner Music Group|Warner Bros.]] label, it saw [[John Frusciante]], who had previously appeared on ''[[Mother's Milk]]'' and ''[[Blood Sugar Sex Magik]]'',  replace [[Dave Navarro]] as the band's guitarist. The album produced many hits for the band, including "[[Around the World (Red Hot Chili Peppers song)|Around the World]]", "[[Otherside]]", "[[Californication (song)|Californication]]" and [[Grammy]]-award winning "[[Scar Tissue]]". ''Californication'' is the Chili Peppers' best-selling album to date, reaching #3 on the US [[Billboard 200]] and selling more than 15 million copies worldwide.<ref name="billboard">{{Cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/retrieve_chart_history.do?model.chartFormatGroupName=Albums&model.vnuArtistId=5507&model.vnuAlbumId=815996|title=Red Hot Chili Peppers album chart history|accessdate=2007-04-20|publisher=Billboard}}</ref><ref name="bbc">{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/3864401.stm|title=Chili Peppers' album tops survey|accessdate=2007-04-20|publisher=BBC}}</ref> It marked a change in style for the Chili Peppers; Greg Tate of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine noted that "while all previous Chili Peppers projects have been highly spirited, ''Californication'' dares to be spiritual and epiphanal".<ref name="rsreview">{{Cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/277669/californication|title=''Californication'' review|accessdate=2007-04-20|publisher=''Rolling Stone'' magazine|author=Greg Tate}}</ref>

The title ''Californication'' is sometimes mistaken as a [[portmanteau]] of "[[California]]" and "[[fornication]]". However, in an interview with [[MTV]] in 2000, band member [[Anthony Kiedis]] stated that it is a not a sexual reference and that "californication" is "the act of the world being affected and saturated by the art and the culture being born and raised in California".<ref name="mtvinterview">{{Cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/archive/c/chilisfeature99_1.jhtml|title=Red Hot Chili Peppers: ''Californication''|accessdate=2007-04-20|publisher=MTV}}</ref>

==Background==
In the years following guitarist John Frusciante's departure from the band, it became known that he had developed a heroin addiction that left him in poverty and near death.<ref name="redux">{{cite web| author=Skanse, Richard| url =http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/redhotchilipeppers/articles/story/5923940/red_hot_redux | title = Red Hot Redux | publisher = RollingStone.com | date = [[1998-04-30]]| accessdate = 2007-03-31}}</ref> He was talked into admitting himself to drug rehabilitation in January 1998.<ref> All Music Guide John Frusciante Biography [http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&searchlink=JOHN|FRUSCIANTE&sql=11:7veyxdkbjoly~T1]</ref> In [[April 1998]], following Frusciante's three month completion, Flea visited his former band-mate and openly invited him to re-join the band, an invitation an emotional Frusciante readily accepted. Within the week and, for the first time in six years, the reunited foursome gathered to play, and jump-started the newly reunited Red Hot Chili Peppers.<ref> (Entire Paragraph) Anthony Kiedis - Scar Tissue; pages 389-400</ref>

==Writing and composition==
[[Image:John4.jpg|240px|thumb|right|Guitarist [[John Frusciante]]'s return showcases the band's stylistic changes.]]
A considerable amount of the album's formation took place in the band member's homes in the summer of 1998. Kiedis and Frusciante often spent days together at each other's homes, discussing song creation, guitar riffs and lyrical content. Much of the instrumental formation was pieced together through jam sessions, although this unrestricted nature was not present in the finished album which  favored a more structured song configuration.<ref> Anthony Kiedis - ''Scar Tissue''; Page 401-406</ref>  

While most of the album progressed rapidly, Californication itself remained a difficult song to put together. Frusciante felt compelled to write an appropriate guitar ensemble to accompany the powerful lyrics, but encountered difficulty.<ref>Anthony Kiedis - ''Scar Tissue''; page 407</ref> The song was barely making progress, and was nearly scrapped had it not been for Kiedis' urgency to include it on the album. Only two days before the album<U+2019>s initial recording ended did Frusciante set the final riff into place, and taught the rest of the band how to perform it. Californication is, essentially, a detailed classification of California, and, more specifically, the "fake" nature which is associated with much of [[Hollywood]]. 

Californication's lyrics were derived from Anthony Kiedis' ideas, outlooks, and perceptions of life and its meaning. "Porcelain" resulted after Kiedis met a young mother at the [[YMCA]], who was attempting to battle her alcohol addiction whilst living with her infant daughter.<ref> Anthony Kiedis - ''Scar Tissue''; page 404</ref> Sarcasm had also been lingering in his mind for quite some time and he decided to devote an entire song to the concept. Kiedis found inspiration from former band mate [[Dave Navarro]], who he considered the "King of Sarcasm".<ref> Anthony Kiedis - ''Scar Tissue''; page 409</ref> Frusciante began playing a poignant guitar riff, which Kiedis immediately saw integrating smoothly into "Scar Tissue". Running outside with joy, he saw birds flying gracefully overhead which inspired the lyric "With the birds I'll share this lonely view."<ref> Anthony Kiedis - ''Scar Tissue''; page 408</ref>

The album was a change of style for the Chili Peppers, especially when compared to their previous album, which combined various elements of [[psychedelic rock]] and [[Hard Rock]]. Although ''Californication'' still contained their once essential "funk rock" trademark sound (such as "Purple Stain", "Get On Top", "I Like Dirt" and "Around the World" and <U+201C>Right on Time<U+201D>), it leaned towards more melodic and epic oriented melodies (for example, "[[Scar Tissue]]" and "[[Otherside]]") and focused on songs with implemented structure rather than [[jam session|jams]]. [[Alternative rock]] was tangible in tracks like <U+201C>Easily<U+201D> and <U+201C>Emit Remmus<U+201D>.<ref name="rsgreatest" /> This change was attributed by Greg Prato of [[All Music Guide]] to the return of Frusciante to the lineup.<ref name="music.com">{{Cite web|url=http://www.music.com/release/californication/1/|title=''Californication''|accessdate=2007-04-21|publisher=music.com|year=2004|author=Greg Prato}}</ref> 

His return came with a more experimental style;  one song in particular, "Emit Remmus", features a repeating guitar riff that was deliberately recorded backwards (hence the title "Emit Remmus", "Summer Time" backwards).<ref name="tv.com">{{Cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/red-hot-chili-peppers/person/4601/summary.html|title=Red Hot Chili Peppers trivia|accessdate=2007-04-27|publisher=tv.com}}</ref> Experimental guitar work is consistent in  "Savior", and <U+201C>This Velvet Glove<U+201D>, as a [[Mellotron]] and other distortion methods were employed. The album includes multiple references to drugs and [[Hollywood]].<ref name="eweekly">{{Cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,64068,00.html|title=''Californication''|accessdate=2007-04-21|publisher=Entertainment Weekly|year=1999|author=David Browne}}</ref>

==Release and critical recognition==

''Californication'' was released on [[CD]] on June 8, 1999. It was [[RIAA certification|certified]] 'gold' just over a month later, on [[July 22]] [[1999]], and its continuing sales have resulted in it being certified five-times multi-platinum.<ref name="riaa">{{Cite web|url=http://www.riaa.com/gp/database/search_results.asp|title=RIAA Certification Database|accessdate=2007-05-25}}</ref> With the return of [[John Frusciante]] playing [[guitar]], the Red Hot Chili Peppers managed to regain their critical acceptance after its less popular predecessor, ''[[One Hot Minute]]'', and it has achieved a far greater commercial success worldwide.<ref name="sputnikmusic">{{Cite web|url=http://www.sputnikmusic.com/album.php?albumid=356|title=''Californication'' review|accessdate=2007-04-20|publisher=Sputnik Music|author=Ross Delaney}}</ref><ref name="billboard" />

"Scar Tissue" won a [[Grammy]] award for best rock song in [[2000 in music|2000]].<ref name="2000grammys">{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/specials/2000/grammys/list.html|title=42nd Annual Grammy Awards nominations|accessdate=2007-04-20|publisher=CNN}}</ref> Over the years ''Californication'' has remained popular; in 2003, the album was ranked number 399 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine's list of [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|the 500 greatest albums of all time]] and, in 2006, the Chili Peppers recorded a five-set playlist for [[AOL Sessions]] that included "Californication" and "Scar Tissue".<ref name="aolsessions">{{Cite web|url=http://music.aol.com/artist/red-hot-chili-peppers/5241/main|title=AOL Sessions|accessdate=2007-04-20|publisher=AOL Music}}</ref><ref name="rsgreatest">{{Cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/6626238/399_californication|title=The RS 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|accessdate=2007-04-20|publisher=''Rolling Stone''}}</ref><ref name=acclaimed>{{Cite web|url=http://www.acclaimedmusic.net/061024/A3752.htm|title=Accolades| accessdate=2007-06-05|publisher=AcclaimedMusic.net}}</ref> The album produced many staple hits for the Chili Peppers, so much so that five of the fifteen songs on their ''[[Greatest Hits (Red Hot Chili Peppers album)|Greatest Hits]]'' album were taken from ''Californication''.<ref name="greasthitstracklisting">{{Cite web|url=http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:jvfixqyaldse|title=Red Hot Chili Peppers: Greatest Hits|accessdate=2007-04-21|publisher=[[AMG|All Music Guide]]}}</ref>

The album has received criticism for what Tim Anderson of ''[[The Guardian]]'' called "excessive compression and distortion" in the process of digital remastering,<ref name="guardianquality">{{Cite web|url=http://technology.guardian.co.uk/online/insideit/story/0,,1992466,00.html|title=How CDs are remastering the art of noise|accessdate=2007-04-20|publisher=The Guardian}}</ref> and was the subject of an online petition with garnered over 1,000 signatures.<ref name="soundpetition">{{Cite web|url=http://www.petitiononline.com/RHCPWBCD/petition.html|title=Sound Quality petition|accessdate=2007-04-20|publisher=Petition Online}}</ref>
