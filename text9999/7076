The physical DVD of ''kin'' contains all the music videos which play together as a 45-minute film.

==Background==
''kin'' is iamamiwhoami's first full-length album, about two years after releasing two series of music videos (dubbed the "Preludes" and "Bounty" series) on [[YouTube]]. Additionally, during the [[Grammis]] in 2011, an anonymous woman accepted the Innovator of the Year award on behalf of iamamiwhoami and opened an envelope to reveal a blank piece of paper, hinting that the album had been in production since 2011.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dominicmercurio.com/2012/02/16/iamamiwhoami-how-this-audiovisual-artist-brought-mystery-back-to-art/ |title=iamamiwhoami: How This Audio/Visual Artist Brought Mystery Back To Art |publisher=Dominic Mercurio |date=16 February 2012 |accessdate=20 April 2012}}</ref> The album was eventually confirmed by Cooperative Music in February 2012.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iambountyfan.com/post/17609440214/cooperative-confirms-iamamiwhoami-audio-visual |title=Cooperative confirms Iamamiwhoami Audio + Visual Album |publisher=iambountyfan |date=14 February 2012 |accessdate=14 April 2012}}</ref> Unlike most traditional albums which only release singles after the album is out, singles from ''kin'' were released on their YouTube channel, with a new song and an accompanying music video every two weeks. The music video is released one day before the single.<ref>{{cite web |last=Cotter |first=Neal |url=http://www.insidevandy.com/life/music/article_2023782a-717f-11e1-92a6-001a4bcf6878.html |title=Iamamiwhoami: An audiovisual experience |publisher=Inside Vandy |date=18 March 2012 |accessdate=20 March 2012}}</ref> The music videos from ''kin'' are set as a film, with each music video linking directly to the next. They feature [[Jonna Lee (singer)|Jonna Lee]] (the only prominent human being throughout) along with five other hairy figures who later vanish, and are set in differing landscapes, ranging from a high-rise apartment building to the middle of a desert.

''kin'' gained attention on the Internet due to video chapters from the album being released online beginning since December 2009.<ref>{{cite web |last=D<U+00ED>az |first=Marta |url=http://visualmag.net/videos/iamamiwhoami-marketing-enigmas-and-art |title=iamamiwhoami: marketing, enigmas and art |publisher=visualMAG |date=26 April 2012 |accessdate=30 April 2012}}</ref>  Each time a new single is released, iamamiwhoami emails various music blogs to alert them, and there are no accompanying press releases or offers of interviews.<ref>{{cite web |last=Ehrlich |first=Brenna |url=http://blog.omusicawards.com/2012/05/iamamiwhoami-drops-new-track-rascal-before-debut-album-in-june/ |title=iamamiwhoami Drops New Track, "Rascal," Before Debut Album In June |publisher=[[O Music Awards]]. [[MTV Networks]] |date=8 May 2010 |accessdate=10 May 2012}}</ref>

Multiple lyrics from the tracks of ''kin'' were given as responses to questions posted in an interview with ''Bullett'' magazine in November 2011. The article also features a photo shoot featuring Lee posing in parts of a forest, and a room filled with styrofoam.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bullettmedia.com/article/iamamiwhoami/ |title=An Inscrutable Interview with (and Exclusive Photo Series from) iamamiwhoami |work=Bullett |date=11 November 2011 |accessdate=12 May 2012}}</ref>

On 25 May 2012, rumours began to circulate that iamamiwhoami was still shooting videos with the announcement of ninth single "goods", originally intended to be exclusive to the album. iambountyfan stated that ''kin'' had been pushed back to 4 September 2012 on their Facebook page, all of which was false. Release dates continued to fall in line with their original intention, "goods" having a tentative release of 5 June 2012.<ref>{{cite web |last=Kozain |first=RJ |url=http://2020k.wordpress.com/2012/05/28/iamamiwhoami-berlin-festival-2012-o-award-kill-revie/ |title=Iamamiwhoami Book 2012 Berlin Festival, Nominated for another O Award, Release "Kill" |publisher=2020k |date=28 May 2012 |accessdate=28 May 2012}}</ref> On 30 May 2012, a cryptic video titled "iamamiwhoami; kin 20120611" was uploaded on iamamiwhoami's YouTube channel, which featured a blank sheet of paper kept within a noticeboard, as well as the name of the album, release date and ending with a logo of their label, Cooperative Music.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfLYfz_25BI |title=iamamiwhoami; kin 20120611 |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=30 May 2012 |accessdate=30 May 2012}}</ref> However, on this same date, Base, iMusic and other sites withdrew all methods of buying ''kin'' on their website. People pre-ordering the album from iMusic received an email saying that the album had been delayed until September, so all back-orders had to be cancelled.

On 6 June 2012, To whom it may concern. was updated and a shop segment was included. It was announced there that ''kin'' would be released in two versions (CD/DVD or vinyl LP) via the website on 11 June, and Cooperative Music Music released it on 4 September. A merch section with T-shirts, socks and briefs opened. A free digital download link of ''kin'' is included when purchasing the physical copy of the album.

==Concept==
{{Quote box|align=left|width=25%|quote="I needed to create something in a form that can be held and cared for by the audience as they are part of the creation. The sounds of kin convey that. When iamamiwhoami started in early 2009 ''kin'' was not yet conceived as an idea. The process of developing ''kin'' started in August 2011."|source=<U+2014> [[Jonna Lee (singer)|Jonna Lee]], on the album's development<ref>{{cite web |last=Gasior |first=Zuzanna |last2=Kubisty |first2=Irma |url=http://thisispaperstories.com/iamamiwhoami/ |title=iamamiwhoami <U+2013> interview |publisher=Thisispaper Stories |date=3 September 2012 |accessdate=8 September 2012}}</ref>}}
The creative process behind ''kin'' started after iamamiwhoami played their first live show at [[Way Out West Festival]] in 2011, which Lee described as "a close encounter with the audience".<ref name="dazed">{{cite web |url=http://www.dazeddigital.com/music/article/14028/1/exclusive-qa-iamamiwhoami |title=Exclusive Q&A: iamamiwhoami |work=[[Dazed & Confused (magazine)|Dazed & Confused]] |publisher=Waddell Limited |date=20 August 2012 |accessdate=8 September 2012}}</ref><ref name="guardian">{{cite web |last=Cragg |first=Michael |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/aug/11/iamamiwhoami-jonna-lee |title=The ethereal world of Jonna Lee |work=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=[[guardian.co.uk]] |date=11 August 2012 |accessdate=8 September 2012}}</ref> In an interview with ''[[Dazed & Confused (magazine)|Dazed & Confused]]'' magazine, Lee stated that ''kin'' "refers to the kinship with the audience and how it is created in a shape that the audience will be able to embrace<U+2014>where our previous releases were more fluid [...] The whole ''kin'' album is tied together both musically and visually."<ref name="dazed"/> She also elaborated on the visual aspect of the album and the videos, saying, "Everything has been done in real time so every time a production starts, it's being released very soon after to keep the conversation with the audience in the present. It's a chronological storyline of an evolution, from the very beginning up to now. I think the Internet is the place where you can do that. ''kin'' is tying those two works together in the sense that it's a physical thing that you can touch also."<ref name="dazed"/>

The core of iamamiwhoami is the music, where the lyrics are "the script for the story happening and being shared in real time".<ref>{{cite web |last=Andrieux |first=Amy |url=http://www.mtviggy.com/interviews/the-elusive-genius-of-iamamiwhoami/ |title=The Elusive Genius of iamamiwhoami |publisher=MTV Iggy. MTV Networks |date=6 September 2012 |accessdate=8 September 2012}}</ref> "Blending them together they create a new way of communicating for me. ''kin'' can be experienced either sonically, visually or merged depending on what is preferred", Lee said.<ref name="clash">{{cite web |last=Heath |first=Theresa |url=http://www.clashmusic.com/feature/kin-iamwhoiamwhoami |title=kin: iamamiwhoami |work=[[Clash (magazine)|Clash]] |date=31 August 2012 |accessdate=8 September 2012}}</ref> She defines iamamiwhoami as a multimedia "entity", which also includes directors, designers and close friends. "Leaving space for everyone's imagination to run free is a big part of it, both in terms of how we communicate and also in not being overly clear what the message is. It's kind of like receiving a script for a movie and reading it while you're watching it."<ref name="guardian"/> According to Lee, the reason behind iamamiwhoami's initial anonymity is that she was unsure as to what she wanted the project to be. "I wanted to create undisturbed away from the noise together with my collaborators. It was necessary to work in the quiet for iamamiwhoami to be able to continue to have a life. My identity was not hidden but neither articulated by me because what is relevant is the work we have done and the audience reflection of my identity."<ref name="clash"/> She added that she did not give interviews earlier because she felt "[i]t would have all looked like a big promotional campaign. I would have been a sad person for a long time. I can't say that I would have been here now. But it's evolved in a way that we can still do it."<ref name="guardian"/>

When questioned about the plain black cover of ''kin'' in an interview with [[PopMatters]], Lee commented that the album was "packaged in a shape suited for consumption. The shape iamamiwhoami needed to adopt to be able to deliver it. The cover of ''kin'' is the portrait of the black box [featured at the end of the video for "goods", and the end of the ''kin'' film proper]. The simple may not seem grand at first glance but looking closer at its contents can be rewarding, depending on if you choose to experience it from the inside or the outside of its boundaries."<ref>{{cite web |last=Sawdey |first=Evan |url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/feature/163513-in-due-order-an-interview-with-iamamiwhoami/ |title=In Due Order: An Interview with iamamiwhoami |publisher=[[PopMatters]] |date=5 October 2012 |accessdate=5 October 2012}}</ref>

Kim Taylor Bennett of ''[[Time Out (company)|Time Out London]]'' stated that "each glacial electro-pop track is matched by an equally unsettling video.
