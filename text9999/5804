'''Cochin International Airport''' {{Airport codes|COK|VOCI}}, also known as '''Kochi International Airport''' or '''Nedumbassery Airport''', is located at [[Nedumbassery]], near [[Kochi, India|Kochi]] (formerly known as Cochin) in [[India]].

Built in the traditional architectural style of [[Kerala]], the airport is owned by Cochin International Airport Limited (CIAL), a public company, initially held by a large number of Non Resident Indians (Indians who live outside India), major Indian corporations as well as a 13% holding by the government of [[Kerala]]. This is the first International Airport in India to be built with only a minority (13%) Central Government stake in a public-private partnership project (aka PPP). The total government stake, state and central, is thus 26%. The Chief Minister of Kerala is the chairman of CIAL.

The Airport is located about 30 km (19 miles) from the central city area of Kochi, and amenities such as pre-paid [[taxis]] are readily available. The serene location of the airport and the availability of undeveloped land near the location provides ample opportunity for growth in the region. This has helped to make it the biggest airport of [[Kerala]].

It is also one of only 5 (out of a total 120 odd) airports which actually have a proper airport licence, the others being Mumbai, Delhi and a couple of minor ones.

With a 3,400-metre long runway, the airport is equipped to operate any type of aircraft currently in commercial service. It is at present the fourth busiest airport in India in terms of international traffic.<ref>[http://keralaitmission.org/web/main/?action=0&what=100038 The IT hubs of Kerala]</ref> while two other Kerala airports are in 5th and 8th positions on this dimension. It has a taxi track of 930 metres with two link taxis connecting the runway spread over the panchayats of Nedumbasserry, Sreemoolanagaram and Kanjoor. 

Currently in expansion mode, the airport is envisaged to accommodate the super jumbo [[Airbus 380]].<ref>[http://www.cochin-airport.com/html/0500fram.htm CIAL technical information]</ref> The airport is the only one thats ready to accomodate the A-380, in the country. The construction of a new international terminal area with duty free shops has been completed recently.

The total cost of the airport project was 3,150,000,000 [[Rupees]] (US$68,478,000). The airport has two terminals one each for domestic and international flights. The ground control is handled by Air India and the fuel supply to the airport is by the Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd. Both hold interest free security deposits in CIAL. 

The airport company holds 440 acres (1.6 km<U+00B2>) of prime land at its disposal for commercial deployment. A Rs 35 billion master plan has been developed by CIAL to generate revenues from this. The various projects involved include an 18-hole golf course, business centre, hotel chains, multiplexes, industrial and IT Parks and logistics centre. 

Cochin International Airport has direct non-stop international flights to Abu Dhabi, Bander Abbas, Colombo, Dammam, Doha, Dubai, Kuwait, Muscat, Riyadh, Sharjah, and Singapore. Flights are available with one or more stops to Bahrain also. It is also linked with Chennai, Coimbatore, Delhi, Mumbai, Goa, Agatti, Thiruvanathapuram, Hyderabad and Bangalore by domestic flights. Cochin Airport is widely considered as Best Airport in India.
