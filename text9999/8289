'''Fagernes Airport, Leirin''' {{Airport codes|VDB|ENFG}} ({{lang-no|Fagernes lufthavn, Leirin}}) serves [[Fagernes]] and the surrounding valleys of [[Valdres]], [[Hallingdal]] and [[Gudbrandsdal]] in [[Southern Norway|Southern]] [[Norway]], {{convert|190|km|mi}} from [[Oslo]]. Opened in 1987, it is owned and operated by state-owned [[Avinor]]. The airport is {{convert|829|m|ft}} above sea level, and has a {{convert|2060|m|ft|sing=on}} runway. It provides a regional service for the local population to [[Oslo Airport, Gardermoen|Oslo]], subsidized by the [[Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communications|Ministry of Transport]], as well as charter services during winter serving the nearby ski resorts. In 2008, the airport had 7,419&nbsp;passengers.

The airport was originally planned as a conventional regional airport, but during its construction it was redesigned to accommodate larger jet aircraft. Originally owned by six local municipalities, it was taken over by the state in 1996. [[Norsk Air]] started operations in 1987, but terminated them the following year. [[Coast Air]] introduced state-subsidized services in 1990, and continued until the contract was won by [[Teddy Air]] in 1996. From 2000 the airport was served by [[Guard Air]], but following their bankruptcy in 2001, services were taken over by [[Wider<U+00F8>e]] for six months, when [[Arctic Air]] won a one-year contract. Coast Air resumed the service from 2003 to 2008, when they went bankrupt. [[Air Norway]] then operated services for one year, pending [[DOT LT]]'s  take over in 2009.

==Operations==
[[Air Norway]] provides a scheduled service from Fagernes to [[Oslo Airport, Gardermoen]] throughout the year. It offers a morning and afternoon round flight Monday through Friday, as well as an evening flight on Sundays. Air Norway also operates a weekly round trip to [[Aalborg Airport]] in Denmark, with departure on Friday and return on Sunday.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.airnorway.no/timetable.jsp?menuId=314 |title=Tidstabell |author=[[Air Norway]] |date= |accessdate=30 January 2009 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> The company's plane, a [[Fairchild Metroliner]], is [[wet lease]]d from [[North Flying]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.airnorway.no/content.jsp?menuId=112 |title=Om oss |author=[[Air Norway]] |date= |accessdate=30 January 2009 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> The services are subsidized by the [[Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communications]], based on three-year [[public service obligation]] tenders. From 1 April 2009, the route will be taken over by [[DOT LT]], who will operate [[Saab 340]] aircraft.

Charter services are provided during the winter season, serving the wide range of [[ski resort]]s in the area. During the winter of 2009, weekly services are provided by [[Brussels Airlines]] to Copenhagen.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fagernesairport.com/default.asp?nid=162&lid=1 |title=Charter |author=Fagernes Airport |date= |accessdate=30 January 2009 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> In 2008, the airport served 7,419 passengers, down 41.7% from the previous year.

==History==
Plans for an airport at Fagernes were initiated in 1975, and approved by the [[Storting|Norwegian Parliament]] in 1984, along with three other regional airports, at [[R<U+00F8>rvik Airport, Ryum|R<U+00F8>rvik]], [[Mosj<U+00F8>en Airport, Kj<U+00E6>rstad|Mosj<U+00F8>en]] and [[F<U+00F8>rde Airport, Bringeland]]. Construction started in 1985, but plans were changed in 1986, when local authorities decided to build a longer runway to allow charter flights.<ref>{{cite news |url= |title=J. J. Jackobsen ber om flyplassl<U+00E5>n |author= |work= |agency=[[Norwegian News Agency]] |date=21 April 1986 |accessdate= |language=Norwegian}}</ref> The nearby [[Geilo Airport, Dagali]], a two-hour drive away, had already made a similar decision, and was in the process of extending its own runway.<ref>{{cite news |url= |title=Klart for utbygging p<U+00E5> Dagali flyplass |author= |work= |agency=[[Norwegian News Agency]] |page= |date=15 January 1988 |accessdate= |language=Norwegian}}</ref> The airport opened on 31 October 1987. The state had initially paid 60% of the NOK 29.3 million investments for the {{convert|800|m|ft|adj=on}} version of the airport, and the rest was financed by [[municipalities of Norway|municipal]] and [[county municipality (Norway)|county]] grants.<ref>{{cite news |url= |title=Flyplass |author= |work=[[Aftenposten]] |agency= |page= |date=21 March 1986 |accessdate= |language=Norwegian}}</ref> The increased cost of building a longer runway was estimated at NOK 59 million, financed by loans and municipal grants, plus a NOK 10 million investment from Dansk Folkeferie. This gave the airport a {{convert|2060|m|ft|sing=on}} runway.<ref>{{cite news |url= |title=Ny flyplass like viktig som toget |author=Carlsen, Carsten |work=[[Aftenposten]] |agency= |page=36 |date=21 July 1987 |accessdate= |language=Norwegian}}</ref> The airport was owned by Valdres Lufthavn A/S, a privately held limited company with six municipalities as its principal shareholders.<ref>{{cite news |url= |title=Leirin trenger med kapital for <U+00E5> heve standarden [sic] |author= |work= |agency=[[Norwegian News Agency]] |date=19 October 1987 |accessdate= |language=Norwegian}}</ref> Following the airport's establishment, the [[Norwegian State Railways]]' [[Valdres Line]] was closed in 1989.<ref name=jbvstat>{{cite web |url=http://www.jernbaneverket.no/no/dokumenter/Om-oss/Jernbanestatistikk/Jernbanestatistikk-20071/ |author=[[Norwegian National Rail Administration]] |title=Railway Statistics 2008 |date=2008}}</ref>

By 1988, building costs had increased from NOK 88 to 131 million.<ref>{{cite news |url= |title=Fagernes lufthavn dyrere enn beregnet |author= |work= |agency=[[Norwegian News Agency]] |page= |date=28 September 1988 |accessdate= |language=Norwegian}}</ref> The municipalities had [[co-sign]]ed for a foreign loan, and were forced to pay NOK 3.5 million annually just in interest, in addition to the operating cost of the airport; these were aggravated by not only the loss of the sole scheduled service, but also considerably less charter traffic than estimated.<ref>{{cite news |url= |title=flyplassbaksmell i Valdres |author=Larsen, Gunnar Tore |work=[[Aftenposten]] |agency= |page=19 |date=16 August 1988 |accessdate= |language=Norwegian}}</ref> In 1990, the airport company was forced to refinance, and NOK 61 of 85 million in dept was [[refinancing|refinanced]], and the obligations transferred from the airport company to the municipalities and the county.<ref>{{cite news |url= |title=Valdreskommuner m<U+00E5> svi for Leirin |author= |work=[[Aftenposten]] |agency= |page=3 |date=13 June 1990 |accessdate= |language=Norwegian}}</ref> However, by 1991, passenger numbers were above 20,000, three quarters coming from charter traffic.<ref>{{cite news |url= |title=Rekordtrafikk p<U+00E5> Fagernes lufthavn |author= |work=[[Aftenposten]] |agency= |page=3 |date=24 February 1992 |accessdate= |language=Norwegian}}</ref> On 1&nbsp;January 1996, Fagernes Airport was nationalized, along with 25 other regional airports, and put under the control of the [[Avinor|Norwegian Airport Authority]] (now Avinor).<ref>{{cite news |url= |title=Staten vil ta eieransvar for 26 sm<U+00E5>flyplasser |author=Jentoft, Wiggo |work= |agency=[[Norwegian News Agency]] |date=9 December 1994 |accessdate= |language=Norwegian}}</ref> Following the closure of [[Geilo Airport, Dagali]] in 2003, Fagernes experienced an increase in charter traffic.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.avinor.no/lufthavn/fagernes/omoss/70_Lufthavnens+historie |title=Kontakt Fagernes lufthavn |author=[[Avinor]] |date= |accessdate=30 January 2009 |language=Norwegian}}</ref>

===Operators===
[[Norsk Air]] started a route from Fagernes to [[Oslo Airport, Fornebu]], and [[Bergen Airport, Flesland]], on 4 November 1987, using [[Embraer EMB 120 Brasilia]] aircraft.<ref>{{cite news |url= |title=NorskAIR skal fly p<U+00E5> Valdres |author= |work=[[Aftenposten]] |agency= |page=38 |date=21 October 1987 |accessdate= |language=Norwegian}}</ref> The route turned out to be unprofitable, and was terminated on 1 June 1988, after the company had lost NOK 5 million.<ref>{{cite news |url= |title=Norsk Air legger ned ruter |author= |work= |agency=[[Norwegian News Agency]] |page= |date=4 May 1988 |accessdate= |language=Norwegian}}</ref> About 4,500 passengers were using the airport each year, compared to the 120,000 carried annually by the ''[[NOR-WAY Bussekspress|Valdresekpressen]]'' coach service on the {{convert|190|km|mi}} to Oslo.<ref>{{cite news |url= |title=- Bedre med buss enn Norsk AIR |author=Larsen, Gunnar Tore |work=[[Aftenposten]] |agency= |page=23 |date=25 January 1988 |accessdate= |language=Norwegian}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://visveg.vegvesen.no/Visveg/distances.jsf?lang=no |author=[[Norwegian Public Roads Administration |title=Visveg |accessdate=4 March 2009 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> Local politicians contacted [[Wider<U+00F8>e]] to discuss the possibility of introducing scheduled services, but the airline stated that it would only fly if it was granted subsidies.<ref>{{cite news |url= |title=Ingen flyruter fra Fagernes |author=Egenes, Gry |work=[[Dagens N<U+00E6>ringsliv]] |agency= |page=13 |date=6 July 1988 |accessdate= |language=Norwegian}}</ref>

An agreement for the provision of subsidies on services to Oslo and Bergen was not reached with the Ministry of Transport until 1990. The state agreed to provide NOK 4.5 million, with the the municipalities providing another NOK 2.6 million, and [[Oppland County Municipality]] NOK 2 million. The county and municipalities were allowed to reduce their subsidies in the event that passenger numbers increased. Although initially planned to be introduced in January 1990, Wider<U+00F8>e later dropped out, and the contract was awarded to [[Coast Air]], who began operating on 3&nbsp;September 1990, using a [[de Havilland Canada Twin Otter]] aircraft. The deal was the most expensive subsidy for regional aviation in the country; while the national average was NOK 156, the Fagernes route cost the authorities NOK 2,000 per passenger.<ref>{{cite news |url= |title="Valdresflya" p<U+00E5> vingene fra 3. september |author= |work=[[Aftenposten]] |agency= |page=4 |date=14 August 1990 |accessdate= |language=Norwegian}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url= |title=Fagernes har Norges dyreste flypassasjerer |author=Leander, Sylvi |work=[[Aftenposten]] |agency= |page=3 |date=18 October 1989 |accessdate= |language=Norwegian}}</ref>

Coast Air continued to provide a service until 1 August 1996, when Fagernes became a trial for the use of [[public service obligation]]s for regional aviation in Norway. The first contract was won by [[Teddy Air]], to serve both Oslo and Bergen. The contract agreed a subsidy of NOK 23.7 million for three years, 15% less than Coast Air had been receiving.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.regjeringen.no/en/dep/sd/press-centre/Press-releases/2005/Regionale-flyruter-Tildeling-av-einerett-for-drift-av-16-ruteomrade-.html?id=103429 |title=Teddy Air AS f<U+00E5>r enerett |author=[[Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communications]] |publisher=[[Government.no]] |agency= |page= |date=14 June 1996 |accessdate=29 January 2009 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> Teddy Air operated until 1&nbsp;August 1999, when Wider<U+00F8>e took over using [[Bombardier Dash 8|de Havilland Canada Dash 8-100]] aircraft.
