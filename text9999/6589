The '''Coptic Apocalypse of Paul''' is one of the texts of the [[New Testament apocrypha]] found amongst the [[Nag Hammadi library]]. The text is not to be confused with the ''[[Apocalypse of Paul]]'', which is unlikely to be related.

It was mentioned by [[Epiphanius]] as having been the work of the [[Cainites]], who viewed [[Cain]] as the [[Messiah]] (since, in their view, the [[Old Testament]] [[God]], whom they named [[Demiurge|Yaltabaoth]], was evil.)

The [[Gnostic]] text describes the ascent of Paul through various stages of Heaven, with Yaltabaoth (described as an old man on a throne) attempting to prevent further ascent. A soul that fails to have the knowledge ([[gnosis]]) required to defeat Yaltabaoth here, is sent back, in the vision, to be [[Reincarnation|reincarnated]].

It was a text used by the Sethians.<ref>http://www.thenazareneway.com/apocrypha.htm</ref>
