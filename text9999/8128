{{cquote|Paul had talent... but I don't think he had any more [talent] than a number of lads who came through with him at the time...He had terrible luck with his back, he missed an awful lot of cricket, and a lesser character could well have decided to call it a day. To his credit, Paul came back and worked harder than he'd ever done before. He couldn't bowl as much at the start, so he did an awful lot more batting and, straight away, there were obvious signs of talent there. By the time he forced his way into the Under&ndash;19 team he was batting at the top of the order and the following year he was offered a professional contract.}}

Collingwood made his [[first-class cricket|first&ndash;class]] debut against [[Northamptonshire County Cricket Club|Northamptonshire]] in 1996, at Durham's [[Riverside Ground]].  He made an immediate impression by taking the [[wicket]] of former England all&ndash;rounder [[David Capel]] with his first ball, and scoring 91 in his first innings.<ref>{{Cite web
