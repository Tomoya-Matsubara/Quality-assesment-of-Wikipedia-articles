{{otherships|HMS Bream}}
'''HMS ''Bream''''' (1804) was a [[Royal Navy]] [[Ballahoo class schooner|''Ballahoo''-class schooner]] of 4 12-pounder [[carronade]]s and a crew of 20. The prime contractor for the vessel was Goodrich & Co., in [[Bermuda]], and she was launched in 1807.<ref name=Winfield>Winfield (2008), p.359.</ref> ''Bream'' operated primarily in North American waters and had an uneventful career until the [[War of 1812]]. She then captured two small American privateers and assisted in the recovery of a third, much larger one. She also captured a number of small prizes before she was sold or broken up in 1816.

==Napoleonic Wars== 

She was commissioned in March 1807 under Lieut. Augustus Vere Drury at [[City of Halifax|Halifax]].<ref name=Winfield/><ref name=OBryne/> In April Sub-Lieutenant George Gover Miall, the commander of the schooner [[HMS Chebuctoo|''Chebuctoo'']], was ordered to act as Lieutenant-Commander of the ''Bream''. Miall sailed her to the Leeward Islands.<ref group=Note>Drury was appointed to the cutter [[HMS Sylvia(1806)|''Sylvia'']] on 3 July. Miall was confirmed as a Lieutenant on 11 April 1808.</ref> While ''Bream'' was in the [[Chesapeake Bay]] a mutiny broke out that Lieut. Bartholomew George Smith Day helped suppress.
<ref name=OBryne>O'Bryne (1849).</ref> Miall removed to [[HMS Duguay-Trouin (1780)|''Duguay Trouin'']] on 15 June 1809.<ref name=OBryne/>

On 15 July 1809, Lieut. Henry Dilkes Byng took command, serving on ''Bream'' until October when Sir [[John Borlase Warren]] appointed him to command [[HMS Favorite (1794)|''Goree'']], then in Halifax. He was confirmed in the command on 12 December.<ref name=OBryne/> His replacement, in January 1810, was Lieut. Robert Heriot Barclay. <ref name=Winfield/> 
On 17 August 1810 her commander became (acting) Lieut. John Simpson.<ref group=Note>He was confirmed 14 December 1811.</ref>

While in ''Bream'', Simpson carried specie to St. John's, Newfoundland and was frozen up at [[Louisburg]], [[Cape Breton Regional Municipality, Nova Scotia|Cape Breton]], 
which materially harmed his health.<ref name=OBryne/>  At some point he volunteered, with his whole crew, and joined [[HMS Statira (1807)|''Statira'']], under Captain Hassard Stackpoole, to cruise with her.<ref name=OBryne/>

==War of 1812==
At the end of July 1812, [[HMS Colibri (1809)|''Colibri'']] chased ''Bream'' off Cape Sable, having mistaken her for an American privateer. <ref>Phillips, Michael, ''Ships of the Old Navy'' - ''Bream'' (1807). [http://www.ageofnelson.org/MichaelPhillips/info.php?ref=0387]</ref> (On realizing her mistake ''Colibri'' then chased and took two other vessels, which turned out to be an American privateer and her prize.)<ref>Phillips, Michael, ''Ships of the Old Navy'' - ''Colibri'' (1809). [http://www.ageofnelson.org/MichaelPhillips/info.php?ref=0546]</ref>

On 9 August ''Bream'' captured the American 3-gun privateer ''Pythagoras'' and her crew of 35. The capture took place off [[Shelburne, Nova Scotia|Shelburne]] and took 10 minutes, during which the American suffered two men wounded.<ref>The Royal military chronicle, Vol. 4, p.476.</ref>

In October Admiral Sir [[John Borlase Warren]] dispatched [[HMS Shannon (1806)|''Shannon'']] and ''Bream'' to rescue the crew and offload the money aboard the frigate [[HMS Barbadoes (1804)|''Barbadoes'']], which had been wrecked on [[Sable Island]]. They arrived on 10 October and retrieved both crew (only one of whom had drowned), and the specie. Whilst carrying this out, ''Shannon'' encountered and subsequently captured an enemy privateer, which she took back to Halifax with her. Simpson left ''Bream'' in October 1812 and invalidated back to Britain in 1813.<ref name=OBryne/>

Lieut. Constantine Brown replaced Simpson at Halifax. From late 1812 to 1813 he served in the Bay of Fundy under Capt. Alexander Gordon in [[HMS Rattler (1795)|''Rattler'']]. In 1813 Brown<U+2019>s replacement was Lieut. Charles Hare.<ref name=Winfield/>

On 23 April, ''Bream'' captured the 85-ton (burthen) sloop ''Semiramis'' on her way to Boston from Portsmouth river.

On 19 May, ''Rattler'', with ''Bream's'' assistance, captured the American 18-gun privateer ''Alexander'' off Kenebank ([[Kennebunk, Maine]]). ''Rattler'' drove ''Alexander'', which was returning to Salem after a 10 week cruise, on shore. Most of the crew escaped but several were drowned as they swam from her. ''Bream'' helped ''Rattler'' get ''Alexander'' off.<ref>Marshall (1823-1835), p.226.</ref><ref>Phillips, Michael, ''Ships of the Old Navy'' - ''Rattler'' (1795). [http://www.ageofnelson.org/MichaelPhillips/info.php?ref=1854]</ref>

Then on 9 June, ''Bream'' and Hare captured the American privateer ''Wasp''. The forty-ton ''Wasp'' had two 6-pounder guns and a crew of 33.<ref name=OBryne/> Capturing her required an eight-hour running fight, including a fifty-minute battle at close quarters off [[Brier Island]] in the [[Bay of Fundy]]. ''Wasp's'' captain placed the following advertisement in the [[Saint John, New Brunswick]], ''Courier'' of 27 June:
 <blockquote>A CARD - Lieut. Hare, Commander of H.M. Schooner ''Bream'', is respectfully requested to accept the sincere thanks of Captain Ernest A. Ervin, commander of the American privateer ''Wasp'', of Salem, for the very courteous, friendly and gentlemanlike treatment received while a prisoner on board, the deportment observed toward him being more like a friend and countryman than that of a declared enemy. - St. John, June 13, 1813.<ref name=Snider/></blockquote>

On 12 July ''Bream'' took the schooner ''Jefferson'', out of BOston. Two days later ''Bream'' captured the ''Triton'' bound for [[Kennebeck]] from St. Thomas's. On the same day she captured the ''Betsey'', from [[Tortola]] and bound for Portland.

On 21 or 24 September, the Canadian privateer ''Dart'' drove the American privateer ''Orange'', a chebacco boat of two guns and 11 men, on to [[Fox Island]] in [[Machias Bay]] on the coast of [[Maine]].<ref>Michael Phillips' ''Ships of the Old Navy'' - ''Emulous'' (1812). [http://www.ageofnelson.org/MichaelPhillips/info.php?ref=0836]</ref><ref group=Note>A chebacco was a narrow-sterned boat formerly used in the Newfoundland fisheries; also known as a pinkstern or chebec.</ref> There the boats of [[HMS Emulous (1812)|''Emulous'']] and ''Bream'' destroyed her.<ref name=Snider>Snider (1928, pp.83 & 93.</ref> 

Hare<U+2019>s replacement was again Lieut. Constantine Brown, who remained in command until 4 February 1814 when Lieut. Thomas Beer took command in the Bay of Fundy, and served with her until he was placed on half-pay in September.<ref name=OBryne/> 

On 27 May, ''Bream'' captured the ''Pilgrim''.

Beer commanded ''Bream'' at the capture of [[Moose Island, Maine|Moose Island (Maine)]] in July, and present at the attack on [[Battle of Baltimore|Baltimore]] on 13 September.<ref>Allen (1850).</ref>  ''Bream'' was paid off in May 1815.<ref name=Winfield/>

==Fate==
She was sold or broken up in 1816.<ref name=Winfield/>
