'''''Spider-Man Unlimited''''' is an [[endless runner]] video game developed and published by [[Gameloft]] based on the [[Marvel Comics]] superhero [[Spider-Man]]. In the game, the player controls the title character and his [[alternative versions of Spider-Man|alternate versions]] on his fight against the members of the [[Sinister Six]] and their [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|multiverse]] counterparts. Although an endless runner, the main mode features definitive goals in constrat to the traditional aim of running as far as possible to get the highest score as possible. The game is also known for regularly having special, time-limited community events.

First announced in June 2014, ''Spider-Man Unlimited'' was released for [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] [[iOS (Apple)|iOS]], [[Android OS]] and [[Windows Phone]] on September 10, 2014. Starting from October 2014, Gameloft released four free updates that added new chapters to the story mode, Spider-Men and [[Spider-Woman|Spider-Women]], enemies, events and stages. Since its release, it has been downloaded 30 million times and has been well-received by gaming critics. Reviewers praised controls, audio, animation, and the variety of characters, while criticized its energy system that they considered a limit to the [[playability]].

==Plot==
After Spider-Man defeated a figure known as the [[Alternative versions of the Green Goblin#Phil Urich|Gold Goblin]], [[Nick Fury in other media#Video games|Nick Fury]] tells him that the [[Green Goblin in other media|Green Goblin]] assembled a [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|multiverse]] Sinister Six by a portal and plans to take over Spider-Man's dimension. [[S.H.I.E.L.D]] then used the portal to bring [[alternative versions of Spider-Man]] to aide the battle. Spider-Man goes after the Goblin and his [[Alternative versions of the Green Goblin|alternative versions]] (Gold Goblin, [[Grey Goblin]], [[Menace (Marvel Comics)|Menace]], [[Alternative versions of the Green Goblin#House of M|House of M Goblin]]). After he defeated his arch-enemy's alternative versions, he fights various [[Vulture (comics)|Vultures]] (Classic Vulture, [[Vulture (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate Vulture]], Red Vulture, Dark Vulture). [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]] and his alternatives versions (Classic Electro, [[Electro (Marvel Comics)#Ultimate Electro|Ultimate Electro]], Modern Electro, Pure Energy Electro), [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]] and his alternate versions (Classic Sandman, Noir Sandman, Dark Sandman, and Pure Sand Sandman), and Doctor Octopus as well as the Sinister Soldiers (armored soldiers working for the Multiverse Sinister Six).
