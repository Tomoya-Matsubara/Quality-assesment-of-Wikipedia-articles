'''Peter of Canterbury'''<ref name=Walsh482/> or '''Petrus'''<ref name=DNB>Hunt "[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/22056 Petrus (St Petrus) (d. 605x11)]" ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''</ref> (died c. 607 AD or after 614) was a [[Benedictine]] abbot and companion of [[Augustine of Canterbury|Augustine]] in the [[Gregorian mission]] to England. He became the first abbot of what would become [[St Augustine's Abbey]]. Augustine sent Peter as an emissary to Rome around 600 in order to convey news of the mission to [[Pope Gregory I]]. Peter's death has traditionally been dated to around 607, but evidence suggests that he was present at a church council in Paris in 614, so he probably died after that date.

==Life==

It is presumed that Peter was a native of Italy, like the other members of the Gregorian mission.<ref name=Blair87>Blair ''World of Bede'' p. 87</ref> This mission was dispatched by [[Pope Gregory the Great]] in 596 to proselytize the Anglo-Saxons in England. It landed in Kent in 597, and soon converted King [[<U+00C6>thelberht of Kent]], who gave Augustine the land on which he founded the abbey that later became St Augustine's, Canterbury.<ref name=Mayr61>Mayr-Harting ''Coming of Christianity'' pp. 61<U+2013>63</ref>

The medieval chronicler [[Bede]] records that sometime after the mission's arrival in England,<ref name=Brooks9/> probably in late 600,<ref name=DNB/> Peter, along with fellow-missionary [[Laurence of Canterbury|Laurence]], was sent back to Pope Gregory.  This deputation was to relay the news of Augustine's successes in Kent, and to request more missionaries.<ref name=Brooks9>Brooks ''Early History of the Church of Canterbury'' pp. 9<U+2013>10</ref> They also conveyed to the pope a number of inquiries from Augustine about how to proceed with the mission, and when they returned in 601, they brought back Gregory's replies to Augustine.<ref name=DNB/> 

Peter became the abbot of the monastery that <U+00C6>thelberht founded in Canterbury, originally dedicated to the saints [[Saint Peter|Peter]] and [[Saint Paul|Paul]], but later rededicated as St Augustine's, after the leader of the mission.<ref name=DNB/> Bede describes Peter as both abbot and ''[[presbyter]]'', a word usually translated as priest.<ref name=Brooks88>Brooks ''Early History of the Church of Canterbury'' p. 88</ref>

==Death and veneration==

Peter drowned while crossing the [[English Channel]] on the way to Gaul,<ref name=Blair74>Blair ''World of Bede'' p. 74</ref> at a place called Ambleteuse, near Boulogne.<ref name=DNB/> At first he was buried hastily nearby, but Bede reports that after a light illuminated the grave every night, the locals realised Peter was a saint and exhumed him and re-interred him in Boulogne. The actual date of death is unknown, and since his feast day was celebrated on two different days, 30 December or 6 January, that information does not clear up the mystery. The date of his death is reported to have been 1 year, 7 months and 3 weeks after Augustine's, by [[Thomas of Elmham]], a 15th century chronicler. If this is true, this would give a year of death between 605 and 611.<ref name=DNB/> This information, however, is contradicted by the fact that Peter was present at the Council of Paris in 614, convened by [[Chlothar II]].<ref name=Wood7>Wood "Mission of Augustine" ''Speculum'' p. 7</ref> It is possible that he died during his return from the Council of Paris.<ref name=Hayward204>Hayward "An Absent Father" ''Journal of Medieval History'' p. 204</ref>

He is a considered a saint, with a feast day on 6 January. His cult was [[Canonization#Roman Catholic procedure since 1983|confirmed]] in 1915.<ref name=Walsh482>Walsh ''New Dictionary of Saints'' p. 482</ref> A ''Vita Petri'', or ''Life of Peter'', written by [[Eadmer]] in the 12th century, exists in manuscript form, but it is unreliable.<ref name=DNB/> There is evidence that Peter was the object of veneration in Boulogne in the 15th century, and a church in that town was associated with Peter, although probably not from the start of his cult.<ref name=Hayward206>Hayward "An Absent Father" ''Journal of Medieval History'' pp. 206<U+2013>207</ref>
