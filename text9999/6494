'''''Usos y costumbres''''' ({{lang-en|customs and traditions''; literally,'' uses and customs}}) is a legal term denoting '''indigenous customary law''' in Latin America. Since the era of Spanish colonialism, authorities have recognized local forms of rulership, self governance, and juridical practice, with varying degrees of acceptance and formality. The term is often used in English without translation.

''Usos y costumbres'' political mechanisms are used by numerous indigenous peoples in [[Mexico]], [[Guatemala]], [[Bolivia]], and other countries to govern water rights, in criminal and civil conflicts, to elect their representatives to regional and national bodies.

==Under Spanish colonial rule==
Spanish colonial authorities in the Americas were ordered to investigate the traditions and customs of indigenous communities, and to apply these traditions to disputes among Indian subjects.<ref>{{Cite book | publisher = Duke University Press | isbn = 978-0-8223-2567-3 | last = Rabasa | first = Jos<U+00E9> | title = Writing violence on the northern frontier: the historiography of sixteenth-century: New Mexico and Florida and the legacy of conquest | date = 2000 | page = 11 }}</ref> Scholar Jos<U+00E9> Rabasa traces the term ''usos y costumbres'' to the [[New Laws of 1542]], which ordered traditional procedures be used in dealings with Indians rather than "ordinary" Spanish legal proceedings.
