{{Nihongo|'''''Laputa: Castle in the Sky'''''|<U+5929><U+7A7A><U+306E><U+57CE><U+30E9><U+30D4><U+30E5><U+30BF>|Tenk<U+016B> no Shiro Rapyuta}} (re-titled '''''Castle in the Sky''''' for release in the [[United States]]) is a [[film]] written and [[film director|directed]] by [[Hayao Miyazaki]], released in 1986. It is the first film created and released by [[Studio Ghibli]], although is considered the second by some since ''[[Nausica<U+00E4> of the Valley of the Wind]]'' was created by the founding members two years before. ''Laputa: Castle in the Sky'' won the [[Animage]] Anime Grand Prix in 1986. The name Laputa comes from the name of the floating island in [[Jonathan Swift]]'s novel ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]''.

==Plot==
According to legend, humans were fascinated with the sky; therefore they created increasingly sophisticated ways of lifting aircraft from the ground. This eventually led to flying cities and fortresses. Over time, the cities came crashing back to the ground, forcing the survivors to live on the ground as before. One city, Laputa, is said to remain in the sky, concealed within the swirling clouds of a violent thunderstorm. While most people consider it to be fictional, some believe the legend is true and have sought to find the ancient [[city]]. Airships still remain in common use.

Aboard an airship, a young girl, Sheeta, is escorted to an unknown destination by sinister-looking agents under Colonel Muska. The ship is attacked by a group of sky pirates; in the resulting disorder, Sheeta takes a small pendant from Muska and escapes. The sky pirates, led by an old but vivacious woman Dola, attempt to seize her and the pendant, but Sheeta accidentally falls from the ship. As she falls, the pendant radiates a [[blue]] [[light]] and she gently floats to the ground. A young boy miner, Pazu, witnesses this in amazement and catches Sheeta. He takes her back to his home, where she finds a photograph of Laputa. Pazu explains that his deceased father, an aerial pilot and adventurer, took the photo, but was disbelieved by his contemporaries. Pazu believes the city exists, however, and wants to find it someday himself.

Dola's band of sky pirates arrive at Pazu's house, forcing the children to escape on a railway. Their path is eventually blocked by an armoured train; the government agents inside attempt to capture Sheeta. With both pursuing parties fighting each other over the girl, the children fall from a collapsing rail trestle, but are saved when Sheeta's pendant activates once again, allowing them to float safely into an abandoned mine shaft.
[[Image:Vlcsnap-665109.jpg|right|thumb|Sheeta and Pazu]] There they meet an old miner, Uncle Pom, who tells them of "volucite" ("aetherium" in Disney's English language dub), the [[crystal]] that provided Laputa with its power. He reveals that Sheeta's pendant is one of the largest and purest of such crystals in existence, and counsels Sheeta to remember that the crystal's power rightly belongs to the [[earth]], and that she should never use it to commit acts of [[violence]].

Upon returning to the surface of the land, Sheeta tells Pazu that she has inherited an ancient "secret name": Lusheeta Toel Ul Laputa (Laputian for "Sheeta, True Ruler of Laputa"). Government agents suddenly appear and take them both into custody. They are taken to a fortress and separated.

The general in command of the fortress discusses with Muska the government-sponsored search for Laputa, and agree that Sheeta and her crystal are the keys to its discovery. Muska reveals to Sheeta his knowledge of her true name, shows her a huge [[android]] [[robot]] believed to have been created in Laputa, and tells her that unless she cooperates with him in the search of Laputa and unlocking the crystal's secrets, which he believes can be used to physically locate Laputa, Pazu is likely to come to harm. Seeking to protect her friend, Sheeta tells Pazu that she has agreed to cooperate with Muska and the army in search of Laputa and asks him to forget her and Laputa. Stunned by this apparent rejection, Pazu returns to his village, only to find Dola's pirate family occupying his home. Pazu tells Dola of his experiences; when the pirates learn that Sheeta, Muska, and the general will depart the fortress in search of Laputa aboard the gigantic military airship ''Goliath'', Pazu begs Dola to take him with her.

In the fortress tower, Sheeta absent-mindedly recites a spell given by her grandmother, causing the crystal to illuminate a strange blue light that points to Laputa. The spell also re-animates the robot, which wreaks havoc all over the fortress, causing it to catch on fire. The robot rescues Sheeta, demonstrating its loyalty, before it is destroyed by the ''Goliath'' airship. In the meantime, Dola and Pazu show up and rescue Sheeta from the burning tower.

The children and Dola's pirates pursue the ''Goliath'' aboard the pirate ship ''Tiger Moth'', intent on finding Laputa before the ''Goliath'' does. That night, as Sheeta and Pazu stand watch on the crows nest, they talk at length about their respective lives, touching upon Sheeta's study of magic words and mentioning one such spell, the Spell of Destruction, a power Sheeta has never used. Dola, who is awake in bed, overhears their discussions through the intercom.

Amid their conversation, Pazu sees the ''Goliath'' rise from the clouds. The airship attacks, but the ''Tiger Moth'' escapes unharmed. The ''Tiger Moth'' enters a storm, and Dola tells the children to keep watch above the clouds by turning the crows nest into a glider.  Soon a massive cloud becomes visible.  Pazu recognises it from his father's descriptions as Laputa's hiding place. As they try to find a way in, the ''Goliath'' attacks again and the glider Sheeta and Pazu are riding is blasted away from the pirate ship. The children land in Laputa, only to find the city devoid of human life, having only a single robot among the ruins taking care of the grounds. This robot is implied to be "friends" with small animals. In the grounds is a gargantuan tree, whose [[root]]s have pervaded Laputa's base.

The ''Goliath'' arrives at Laputa, whereupon the soldiers plunder the city's vast treasures. The ''Tiger Moth'' is found wrecked on the surface, with Dola and the pirates being held captive. As Pazu attempts to rescue Dola, Sheeta witnesses Muska locating a hidden entrance to a large sphere that surrounds the city's core; she is subsequently captured and taken inside. Pazu frees the pirates and, after many difficulties, finds another way into the sphere.

Muska takes Sheeta into Laputa's core, a chamber holding a gigantic Volucite/Aetherium crystal that serves as the city's power source, and reveals that he is also an heir to the throne of Laputa. He takes control of Laputa and all its [[technology]] and demonstrates the power of the city to the army by beaming an immensely powerful blast toward the surface.  He then activates hundreds of robots to wipe out the army and the ''Goliath'' while Dola and the pirates hide from the robots inside the remains of the ''Tiger Moth''. Sheeta frees herself, steals back the crystal and runs through the core with Muska in close pursuit. Eventually, she finds Pazu and passes the crystal to him.

Muska corners Sheeta in the city's throne room. He brandishes a handgun at her, blasting off her plaits and threatening to shoot off her ears next. Pazu then enters, holding a large gun and asking for a moment to talk to Sheeta, which Muska grants. Together, the two children decide to use the Spell of Destruction; with a single word, the pendant releases an enormous power surge that triggers the collapse of the city's core. Muska is blinded and subsequently falls to his death; Sheeta and Pazu are hurled into the tangle of roots from the giant tree. Afterwards they find their way back to the glider and leave Laputa.

The Dola pirates also survive Laputa's destruction aboard their moth fighters, and are overjoyed to be reunited with Sheeta and Pazu in midair. The pirates and the children bid each other a fond farewell and part ways. Meanwhile, the remains of Laputa, held together by the tree, continue to rise, until they apparently establish an [[orbit]] high above the earth.

==Setting==
The world in which the story takes place is clearly [[Earth]], but apparently in an [[alternate history (fiction)|alternate history]]. None of the place names match real-life [[geography]]. The airships appear to use buoyant [[gas]], but are different in appearance than actual dirigibles. The pirate [[ornithopter|flaptors]] and military planes do not resemble actual craft.  The film takes place sometime between 1868 and 1900, as the photograph of Laputa inside Pazu's house, taken by his father, is dated "1868. 7,".

===History===
The history of this alternate world is hinted at in various parts of the film: Laputa, in ancient times, once dominated the world in a hegemony, presumably of other aerial cities (suggested by a woodcut-like piece in the opening credits or scenes), and may have had a [[rotor]] on its bottom and other rotors on its side. Land may have also been attached to Laputa in antiquity; possibly in a different time period than the one in which rotors were attached. Laputa was abandoned 700 [[year]]s before the setting of the film, having controlled the manufacture and mining of the "sky-crystal"; such an art having been abandoned by the film's beginning. The royal family and their subjects abandoned the city, leaving behind an electronic, high-technology core topped by a chamber or greenhouse. There grew a central tree, which proceeded to sink its roots deep into the city and spread its branches outside of the city's top roof, along with several layers or terraces of walls or buildings done in various architectural styles. It is shown to have had at least three [[Terrace (building)|terraces]] of walls topped with one of buildings; it may have had as many as five, as indicated in a tomb marker's seal. This abandonment of Laputa, according to Sheeta and/or Uncle Pom, may have been due to an alienation of the Laputans from the earth; a forgetting that they are intimately connected to the earth and an over-reliance on technology to solve problems. 

The opening part of the woodcut-like opening credits shows a windmill with a [[kiln]] behind it, set in a hillside, with a man tending it. Afterwards, the windmills grow into enormous, apparently partially wind-powered factories or machines, with machinery digging deep into the earth. Dirigibles appear, along with airplanes and helicopters or [[autogyro]]s flying against a clouded cityscape. A giant helicopter-ship is shown rising into the air, and then a Laputa-like city appears, with rotors. Subsequently a scene of floating islands and cities appears. Enormous, boxy, [[metal]]lic [[helicopter]]-ships are shown, having rotors propelling them from the bottom. Disaster strikes: [[lightning]] is shown and redness fills the screen. A sky-city can be seen, faintly, crumbling in the background, and then people are shown leaving the wreckage of a giant helicopter-ship.

===Influences===
Laputa is credited by Colonel Muska with having been behind [[Bible|Biblical]] events and sacred [[Hindu mythology|Hindu legends]] &mdash; thus tying the world of Laputa to our Earth (and to western [[Culture of Europe|European civilisation]]) &mdash; as do the [[Medieval architecture|medieval castle architecture]] of parts of the fort on the ground; the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] and half-timbered buildings in the village near the fort; the British mining-town architecture, clothing, and even ground vehicles of Pazu's homeland; and the Victorian ambiance of the pirate ship.

The [[List of early flying machines|flying machines]] depicted in the opening scenes of the film are similar to [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s early drawings of a wooden [[helicopter]].<ref>{{cite web

Some of the [[architecture]] seen in the film was inspired by a [[Wales|Welsh]] mining town. Miyazaki first visited Wales in 1984 and witnessed the [[UK miners' strike (1984<U+2013>1985)|miners' strike]] firsthand. He returned to the country in 1986 to prepare for ''Laputa'', which he said reflected his Welsh experience: "I was in Wales just after the miners' strike. I really admired the way the miners' unions fought to the very end for their jobs and communities, and I wanted to reflect the strength of those communities in my film."<ref>{{cite web

==Distribution and reception==
In the late 1980s, an English version of ''Laputa'' was briefly shown in the US by [[Streamline Pictures]]. This dub, produced for showing on international flights to Japan, was not produced by Streamline. According to Fred Patten of Streamline, "Streamline Pictures theatrically distributed an English-dubbed print of ''Laputa'' from March 24, 1989 for the next year, but Streamline never dubbed it. Streamline licensed ''Laputa'' from Tokuma Shoten in late 1988 or early 1989, and was sent a print from Japan that had already been dubbed into English for use as an in-flight film by Japan Air Lines on its trans-Pacific flights. "We have no idea who actually dubbed it."<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web

The [[The Walt Disney Company#Studio Entertainment|Disney]]-produced English dub was recorded in 1998 and planned for release on video in 1999, but Disney eventually decided to release it to theaters instead. 

After ''[[Princess Mononoke]]'' flopped financially in the US, ''Laputa's'' release date was pushed back yet again; on occasion the completed dub was screened at select children's festivals. The film was finally released on [[DVD]] and video in the US on April 15, 2003, alongside ''[[Kiki's Delivery Service]]'' and ''[[Spirited Away]]''.  As with ''Mononoke'' and ''Kiki'', critical opinion was mixed about the new dub, but [[Cloris Leachman]] and [[Mark Hamill]]'s performances as Dola and Muska drew praise.<ref>{{cite web

==Title==
{{Original research|date=April 2009}}
English language dubs of ''Laputa'' has been released under three different titles by three separate distributors.

Although meaningless in Japanese, "Laputa" (La puta) translates to "the [[whore]]" in Spanish, which was probably intentional on the part of Swift{{Dubious|date=April 2009}}, who created the concept in ''Gulliver's Travels''. For this reason{{Fact|date=April 2009}}, in 2003, the film's title was shortened from ''Laputa: Castle in the Sky'' to ''Castle in the Sky'' in several countries, including the United States (where Spanish is commonly spoken as a first language by around 10% of the population or as a second language by students), Mexico, and Spain. This change was also carried over to a number of non-Spanish speaking countries, including [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and France, under Disney's Buena Vista Home Entertainment label, despite Laputa having no meaning in either English or French (however the French "La pute" is quite close). Although "Laputa" was removed from the title, it appeared on the rear cover of the DVD, and was used throughout the film, without modification.

The film's full name was later restored in Britain, in February 2006, when Optimum Asia <U+2013> a division of London-based [[Optimum Releasing]] <U+2013> acquired the UK distribution rights to the Studio Ghibli collection.

Additionally, during the late 1980s and early 1990s, the pre-Disney dub was screened in the UK, as an [[art-house]] film, under the alternative title ''Laputa: The Flying Island''. It was also shown at least twice on British television, but some scenes were cut.<ref name="autogenerated1" />

==Differences between versions==

Although the plot and much of the script was left intact, Disney's English dub of ''Laputa: Castle in the Sky'' contains some changes.

* A significant quantity of background chatter and one-liners were added (even more so than in Disney's dub of ''Kiki's Delivery Service''), filling in moments of silence and increasing the frenetic effect of certain scenes.

* Composer [[Joe Hisaishi]] was commissioned to rework and extend his original synthesizer-composed 37-minute soundtrack into a 90-minute piece for symphony orchestra in an effort to make the film more accessible to US audiences who are accustomed to a more substantial musical accompaniment.

* Pazu and Sheeta, as portrayed by [[James Van Der Beek]] and [[Anna Paquin]], are made to sound as several years older, placing them in their mid-teens, rather than their pre-teens.

* Several modifications were made to dialogue spoken to/about Sheeta by members of the Dola gang, including a declaration of love from one of the pirates. In the original Japanese version, the dialogue presented Sheeta as a potential mother figure for the pirates, instead of a potential romantic interest.

* References to [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s ''[[Treasure Island]]'' were removed, as was the reference to [[Jonathan Swift]]'s ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]''.

Although all these alterations were approved by Studio Ghibli and Miyazaki, there have been a number of critics and fans who called them into question. In particular, some fans pointed out that the new soundtrack placed music in scenes that previously involved the dramatic use of natural silence, as in the opening airship raid or when Pazu and Sheeta pass through the storm-cloud. On the other hand, Miyazaki himself is said to have approved of Hisaishi's reworking;<ref>{{cite web
