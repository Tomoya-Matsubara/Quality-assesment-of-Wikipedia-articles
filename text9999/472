'''USS ''New York'' (BB-34)''' was a [[United States Navy]] [[battleship]], the [[lead ship]] of her [[New York-class battleship|class]]. Named for [[New York State]], she was designed as the first ship to carry the {{convert|14|in|adj=on}} gun.

Entering service in 1914, she was part of the U.S. Navy force which was sent to reinforce the [[British Grand Fleet]] in the [[North Sea]] near the end of [[World War I]]. During that time, she was involved in at least two incidents with [[Germany|German]] [[U-Boat]]s, and is believed to have been the only U.S. ship to have sunk one, during an accidental collision in October 1918. Following the war, she was sent on a litany of training exercises and cruises in both the Atlantic and the Pacific, and saw several overhauls to increase her armament. 

She entered the [[Neutrality Patrol]] at the beginning of [[World War II]], and served as a convoy escort for ships to [[Iceland]] and [[Great Britian]] in the early phase of the war. She saw her first combat against coastal artillery during [[Operation Torch]] around [[Casablanca]] in [[North Africa]], and later became a training ship. Late in the war, she moved to the Pacific, and provided artillery support for the [[Battle of Iwo Jima|invasion of Iwo Jima]] and later the [[Battle of Okinawa|invasion of Okinawa]]. Returning to [[Pearl Harbor]] for repairs until the end of the war, she was determined to be obsolete and chosen to take part in the [[Operation Crossroads|nuclear weapons tests]] at [[Bikini Atoll]] in 1946. She survived both explosions and the effects of [[radiation]] on the ship were studied for several years. She was sunk as a target in 1948. She received three [[battle star]]s for her service.

== Design and construction ==
{{main|New York-class battleship}}
''New York'' was the first of two planned [[New York-class battleship|''New York''-class battleships]], though construction on her began after her sister, {{USS|Texas|BB-35|2}}. She was ordered in [[fiscal year]] 1911 as the first class of [[battleship]] in the [[United States Navy]] to carry the {{convert|14|in|adj=on}} gun.{{sfn|Gardiner|Gray|1985|p=114}}{{sfn|Banks|2002|p=27}}
[[File:New York 2163693804 7e7d3712a6 o.jpg|left|thumb|Day after keel ceremony, 12 September 1912]]

She had a [[standard displacement]] of {{convert|27,000|t}} and a [[full-load displacement]] of {{convert|28,367|t}}. She was {{convert|573|ft}} in [[length overall]], {{convert|565|ft}} [[length at the waterline|at the waterline]], and had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|95|ft|6|in}} and a [[draft (nautical)|draft]] of {{convert|28|ft|6|in}}.{{sfn|Gardiner|Gray|1985|p=115}}

She was powered by 14 [[Babcock and Wilcox]] boilers driving two dual-acting [[vertical triple expansion|triple expansion]] reciprocating steam engines, with 28,100 [[indicated horsepower]], with a maximum speed of {{convert|21|knots}}. She had a [[range (aircraft)|range]] of {{convert|7,060|nmi}} at {{convert|10|knots}}.{{sfn|Gardiner|Gray|1985|p=115}}

Armor on ''New York'' consisted of [[belt armor]] from {{convert|10|ft}} to {{convert|12|ft}} thick. Her lower [[casemate]] had between {{convert|9|in}} and {{convert|11|in}} of armor, and her upper casemate had {{convert|6|in}} of armor. Deck armor was {{convert|2|in}} thick, and turret armor was {{convert|14|in}} on the face, {{convert|4|in}} on the top, {{convert|2|in}} on the sides, and {{convert|8|in}} on the rear. Armor on her [[barbettes]] was between {{convert|10|in}} and {{convert|12|in}}. Her conning tower was protected by {{convert|12|in}} of armor, with {{convert|4|in}} of armor on its top.{{sfn|Gardiner|Gray|1985|p=115}}
[[File:New York 2405649896 ab66402479 o.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Construction in 1912]]

Her armament consisted of ten [[14"/45 caliber gun]]s, arrayed in five double mounts designated A, B, Q, X, and Y. As constructed, these turrets had an elevation of 15 degrees, but this was increased to 30 degrees during an overhaul in 1940<U+2013>1941. The class was the last to feature a Q turret mounted amidships.{{sfn|Bonner|1996|p=28}}{{sfn|Friedman|2008|p=299}} As-built, she also carried sixteen [[5"/51 caliber gun|{{convert|5|in|mm|abbr=on}}/51 cal gun]]s arrayed eight to a side, primarily for defense against [[destroyer]]s and [[torpedo boat]]s. The ship was not designed with [[antiaircraft]] defense in mind, but in a later refit it was mounted with eight [[3"/50 caliber gun]]s arrayed four to a side.{{sfn|Bonner|1996|p=28}} The {{convert|5|in|adj=on}} guns were poor in accuracy in rough seas.{{sfn|Bonner|1996|p=115}}{{sfn|Friedman|2008|p=304}} Eventually, the ship carried 21 5"/51 caliber guns. She also had four {{convert|21|in|mm|abbr=on}} [[torpedo tube]]s. Her crew complement consisted of 1,042 officers and enlisted men.{{sfn|Gardiner|Gray|1985|p=115}} 

''New York'' was laid down on 11 September 1911 in [[New York Navy Yard]] in [[Brooklyn]].{{sfn|DANFS|1970|p=552}} The ''New York'' class was constructed under new labor laws that limited the working hours of her construction crews. It was also stipulated that each ship cost less than $6,000,000, excluding cost of armor and armament.{{sfn|Bonner|1996|p=27}} She was launched on 30 October 1912 and [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 15 May 1914.{{sfn|Gardiner|Gray|1985|p=115}} The fifth ship to be named for [[New York State]], she was sponsored by Elsie Calder, the daughter of New York politician [[William M. Calder]].{{sfn|DANFS|1970|p=552}}{{sfn|Bonner|1996|p=116}} The fourth {{USS|New York|ACR-2|2}}, an [[armored cruiser]], was later renamed USS ''Rochester'',{{sfn|Davis|2010|p=125}} and was [[scuttled]] in [[Subic Bay]] in 1941. However, the wreck site for that ship, which has become a popular [[recreational dive site]], is still commonly referred to as USS ''New York''.{{sfn|Davis|2010|p=30}}

==Service history==
Under the command of Captain [[Thomas S. Rodgers]],{{sfn|DANFS|1970|p=552}} ''New York'' headed straight for [[Veracruz (city)|Veracruz]] following its commissioning.{{sfn|Gardiner|Gray|1985|p=115}} She was designated [[flagship]] for [[Rear Admiral]] [[Frank Friday Fletcher]] in July 1914, commanding the fleet occupying and blockading Veracruz to prevent arms shipments from arriving there to support the government of [[Victoriano Huerta]]. The [[United States occupation of Veracruz]] ultimately ended and ''New York'' resumed her [[shakedown cruise]] along the [[East Coast of the United States]].{{sfn|Bonner|1996|p=116}} She also undertook several goodwill duties, and in December 1915 she held a high-profile Christmas party and dinner for several hundred orphans from New York City, as the suggestion of her crew. It later became a tradition on the ship to help underprivileged when possible, earning it the nickname "Christmas Ship." Following this duty, she undertook a number of training exercises off the Atlantic coast.{{sfn|Banks|2002|p=31}}

===World War I===
[[File:USS New York-2.jpg|thumb|''New York'' in [[Hampton Roads, Virginia]], December 1916.]]
Following the United States entry into [[World War I]], ''New York'', under the command of Captain [[Edward L. Beach, Sr.]], became flagship of [[United States Battleship Division Nine (World War I)|Battleship Division 9]] (BatDiv 9), commanded by Rear Admiral [[Hugh Rodman]].{{sfn|Bonner|1996|p=117}} She was sent to reinforce the [[British Grand Fleet]] in the [[North Sea]], arriving at [[Scapa Flow]] on 7 December 1917. The ships of the U.S. fleet were assigned to the [[6th Battle Squadron (United Kingdom)|6th Battle Squadron]] in the Grand Fleet, the American ships joined in [[blockade]] and [[Convoy|escort]].{{sfn|Bonner|1996|p=118}} In December 1917, ''New York'' and the other U.S. battleships took part in several gunnery exercises. ''New York'' scored the highest score of the ships for her main battery, with an accuracy of 93.3 percent.{{sfn|Besch|2001|p=197}} Ultimately the ''New York'' was the best performer in these exercises, the only ship rated as "excellent" while many of her sisters received mediocre performance reviews.{{sfn|Besch|2001|p=198}}

She did not fire any shots during the war, but during at least two occasions, the convoy she was escorting came under attack by German [[U-Boat]]s.{{sfn|Banks|2002|p=31}} On the evening of 14 October 1918, as ''New York'' led a group of battleships into the Pentland Firth, she was rocked by a violent underwater collision on her starboard side, followed shortly after by another to the stern that broke off two of her propeller blades, reducing the ship to one engine and a speed of {{convert|12|kn|mph km/h|abbr=on}}. It was immediately clear to the men on board that she had struck an underwater object, but the depth of the channel meant it could not have been a [[shipwreck]]. Commanders concluded that ''New York'' must have accidentally collided with a submerged German U-boat.{{sfn|Jones|1995|p=66}} They agreed that the submarine had rammed its bow into the ship's side, then been struck moments later by the ship's propeller.{{sfn|Rodman|1927|p=271}} In their opinion, the damage would have been fatal to the German craft.{{sfn|Rodman|1927|p=272}} Postwar examination of German records revealed that the submarine lost may have been {{SMU|UB-113||2}} or {{SMU|UB-123||2}}.{{sfn|Jones|1995|p=67}} This strange<U+2014>and accidental<U+2014>encounter marked the only time in all of Battleship Division Nine's service with the Grand Fleet that one of its ships sank a German vessel.{{sfn|Jones|1995|p=67}}

Badly damaged by the loss of a propeller, the ship sailed to Rosyth under heavy escort for repairs on 15 October. At 01:00 the next morning, a U-boat launched three torpedoes at the damaged vessel, all of which passed ahead of her.{{sfn|Rodman|1927|p=272}} Unlike in previous cases, sufficient evidence existed to suppose that this torpedo attack was not a false alarm<U+2014>a number of officers and men aboard ''New York'' clearly saw the wakes of the torpedoes in the full [[moonlight]], and a submarine was spotted in the immediate vicinity by a patrol shortly after the attack.{{sfn|Jones|1995|p=67}}{{#tag:ref|Jones notes in his dissertation that German records do not contain any report of a torpedo attack upon a battleship on 16 October 1918. He states that the attack may have come from one of the U-boats that were sunk in the area around that time, however.{{sfn|Jones|1995|p=139}}|group=Note}} Ironically, the battleship's wounded condition is possibly what saved her: although standard procedure was to steam at {{convert|16|kn|mph km/h|abbr=on}}, ''New York'' could make only {{convert|12|kn|mph km/h|abbr=on}} on her one operable propeller. Due to this, historian Jerry Jones believes that the German U-boat captain misjudged the ship's speed. With no further damage, however, the battleship was able to safely arrive at a [[drydock]] in Rosyth. As she was lifted clear of the water, a large dent commensurate with a submarine bow was found in her hull.{{sfn|Jones|1995|p=67}}

''New York'' was also frequently host to foreign dignitaries, including [[King George V]] and [[Edward VIII]] of the United Kingdom, as well as prince [[Hirohito]] of the [[Empire of Japan]].{{sfn|Bonner|1996|p=118}} The ship was of great interest to other European powers, as it was in many cases a first chance to see an American ship comparable to a [[dreadnought]] up close.{{sfn|Banks|2002|p=31}} She was on hand for the surrender of the German [[High Seas Fleet]] on 21 November 1918 in the [[Firth of Forth]], several days after the signing of the [[Armistice with Germany|Armistice]], after which she returned to the United States briefly.{{sfn|Banks|2002|p=32}} After arriving in the United States, the shop was overhauled. The secondary battery was reduced to sixteen 5"/51 caliber guns.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|p=205}} She then served as an escort for the [[SS George Washington|SS ''George Washington'']], carrying President [[Woodrow Wilson]], on his trip from the United States to [[Brest, France]] ''en route'' to the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Versailles Peace Conference]].{{sfn|Banks|2002|p=32}}

===Inter-War period===
Arriving back in the United States in 1919, she began to undertake training and patrol duties, including at one point to the [[Caribbean]] with a number of other U.S. ships.{{sfn|Banks|2002|p=32}} During this year, she also saw a refit in [[Norfolk Navy Yard]] where five additional {{convert|5|in|adj=on}} guns and three additional {{convert|3|in|adj=on}} guns were added.{{sfn|Banks|2002|p=33}} In late 1919, she sailed to the [[Pacific Ocean]] and joined the newly-formed [[United States Pacific Fleet]].{{sfn|Bonner|1996|p=118}} She continued to conduct training and patrol duties in the Pacific until the mid-1930s when she was transferred again to the Atlantic, and began operating out of the [[North Atlantic]], with the exception of several occasional trips to the [[West Coast of the United States]].{{sfn|Banks|2002|p=32}}

[[File:USS New York-4.jpg|thumb|left|250px|''New York'' on maneuvers with {{USS|Oklahoma|BB-37|2}} and {{USS|Nevada|BB-36|2}}, 1932]]
In 1926 ''New York'' was considered obsolete compared with other battleships in service, so she steamed to Norfolk Navy Yard for a complete refit. While several other battleships in service, including {{USS|Utah|BB-31|2}} and {{USS|Florida|BB-30|2}} were converted to training ships or scrapped, ''New York'' and ''Texas'' were chosen to be overhauled to increase their speed, armor, armament, and propulsion systems in accordance with the [[Washington Naval Treaty]] of 1922.{{sfn|Banks|2002|p=32}} An additional {{convert|3,000|t}} were added to her for defense against aerial targets and submarines. Her 14 coal burning boilers were converted to six Bureau Express oil-burning boilers and the twin funnels were trunked into one, aft of the forward superstructure. Tripods were fitted in place of lattice masts, and atop the forward tripod a control tower was installed. A tower was built amidships that contained additional fire control to backup to the system on the foremast. A new [[aircraft catapult]] was installed atop "Q" turret and cranes were installed on either side of the funnel for boat and aircraft handling. Additional deck protection was added, and her beam was widened to {{convert|106|ft}}. She was fitted with [[anti-torpedo bulge]]s, though these made maneuvering harder at low speeds and she rolled badly, and her gunfire accuracy was reduced in rough seas.{{sfn|Banks|2002|p=33}} On 4 September 1928, she left for short-range battle drills with {{USS|Arizona|BB-39|2}}, and from 7 to 10 November the ships traveled to [[San Fransisco]] together with {{USS|Pennsylvania|BB-38|2}}.{{sfn|Stillwell|1991|p=313}} On 3 April 1929 she undertook anti-aircraft practice with ''Arizona'', and then the two ships and ''Pennsylvania'' steamed for [[Cuba]], where they stayed until steaming for [[Hampton Roads]] on 1 May.{{sfn|Stillwell|1991|p=314}}

She remained with the Pacific Fleet conducting training and fleet problems until 1937. That year she was selected to carry Admiral Hugh Rodman, the President's personal representative for the coronation of King [[George VI of the United Kingdom|George VI]], ''New York'' sailed to take part in the [[Fleet Review, Royal Navy|Grand Naval Review]] of 20 May 1937 as sole U.S. Navy representative.{{sfn|Banks|2002|p=34}} ''New York'' was fitted with [[XAF RADAR]] in February 1938, including the first United States [[duplexer]] so a single antenna could both send and receive.{{sfn|Macintyre|1967|p=73}} This made her the second ship to be outfitted with radar after {{USS|Leary|DD-158|2}}. The tests conducted on ''New York'' led to similar radars being installed on the [[Brooklyn class cruiser|''Brooklyn'']] and [[St. Louis class cruiser|''St. Louis'' class cruisers]] as well as newer battleship {{USS|West Virginia|BB-48|2}}. For several years, she served primarily as a training ship for midshipmen and newly enlisted sailors.{{sfn|Banks|2002|p=34}}

In September 1939, ''New York'' joined the [[Neutrality Patrol]], safeguarding sea lanes in the North Atlantic, and served with the Atlantic Squadron, later redesignated the [[United States Atlantic Fleet]], for the next 27 months.{{sfn|Bonner|1996|p=119}} In July 1941, she protected a convoy of U.S. troops moving to [[Invasion of Iceland|garrison Iceland]].{{sfn|Banks|2002|p=34}} She saw another modernization in 1940<U+2013>41 where her main battery elevation was increased from 15 to 30 degrees.{{sfn|Banks|2002|p=33}} She was in the midst of this refit on 7 December 1941, when the  Japan [[attack on Pearl Harbor|attacked Pearl Harbor]], sinking many of the battleships in the U.S. Pacific Fleet and bringing the United States into [[World War II]].{{sfn|Banks|2002|p=35}}

===World War II===
With the outbreak of war, ''New York''{{'}}s overhaul was sped up and completed four weeks after the attack on Pearl Harbor. She returned to duty escorting cargo and troop ships to Iceland and [[Scotland]]. She continued on patrol duty for the next year.{{sfn|Banks|2002|p=35}} In her first series of escorts, she left Norfolk 15 February, arrived in New York 16 February, Nova Scotia 21 February, and Iceland 2 March, returning to Norfolk on 27 March. She left there on her second patrol 24 April and arrived at New York the next day, Nova Scotia 2 May, [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] 5 May, and Iceland 10 May, returning to New York on 20 May. The next day she left for a third escort, arriving again at Nova Scotia on 2 June and Scotland on 10 June, returning to Norfolk on 30 June.{{sfn|Banks|2002|p=42}}{{sfn|Bonner|1996|p=120}} Following these three escort missions, she put in for overhaul in Norfolk. the secondary battery was reduced to six {{convert|5|in|mm|abbr=on}} guns and the anti-aircraft armament was increased to ten {{convert|3|in|mm|abbr=on}} guns, 24 [[Bofors 40 mm]] guns, and 42 [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon]]s.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|p=205}} She departed Norfolk on 12 August and arrived the next day at New York. From there, she escorted a convoy to [[Nova Scotia]] where she remained until 22 August, then departed for Scotland where she was from 31 August to 5 September. She returned to Norfolk on 15 September.{{sfn|Banks|2002|p=43}}

[[File:USS New York-5.jpg|thumb|left|''New York'' off North Africa just after the battle at Casablanca]]
The first major action ''New York'' saw was in [[Operation Torch]], the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] invasion of [[North Africa]] in November 1942. She left Norfolk on 23 October in order to join the Allied fleet.{{sfn|Banks|2002|p=43}} Attached to the Southern Attack Group tasked with attacking [[Safi, Morocco]] on 8 November, ''New York'' and cruiser {{USS|Philadelphia|CL-41|2}}, screened by six destroyers, attacked Safi harbor, supporting landings by the [[U.S. 47th Infantry Division]] in the harbor, and defended transports {{USS|Cole|DD-155|2}} and {{USS|Bernadou|DD-153|2}} which came under attack by {{convert|130|mm|adj=on}} [[shore batteries]] at Point De La Tour.{{sfn|Banks|2002|p=35}} ''New York'' fired several salvoes with her {{convert|14|in|adj=on}} guns, with one of them striking the base of the battery and ricocheting into a bunker, destroying the range finder and killing the battery commander and neutralizing the battery.{{sfn|Bonner|1996|p=120}} Further attempts at attacking the landing force with shore batteries were destroyed by ''Philadelphia''{{'}}s guns and aircraft from [[escort carrier]] {{USS|Santee|CVE-29|2}}. New York remained on station until the port was secure, then steamed north to support the Center Group off [[Fedhala]] and [[Casablanca]], specifically to deal with the threat of the [[Vichy France|Vichy French]] battleship [[French battleship Jean Bart (1940)|''Jean Bart'']], but by the time she arrived, that battleship had been disabled by {{USS|Massachusetts|BB-59|2}} and other Vichy French ships had been driven off by {{USS|Brooklyn|CL-40|2}} and {{USS|Augusta|CA-31|2}}. ''New York'' remained on off the coast of North Africa until the beaches were secure, then retired on 14 November.{{sfn|Banks|2002|p=36}} She had expended a total of 60 {{convert|14|in|adj=on}} rounds.{{sfn|Banks|2002|p=40}} She returned to Norfolk on 23 November.{{sfn|Banks|2002|p=43}}{{sfn|Bonner|1996|p=120}}

''New York'' next returned to convoy patrol.{{sfn|Bonner|1996|p=121}} She escorted two convoys to Casablanca from the United States during late 1942, leaving Norfolk 24 November and in New York from 25 November to 12 December, Casablanca from 24 to 29 December, and back in Norfolk on 12 January 1943. She left Norfolk on the second escort on 26 February, in New York from 27 February to 5 March, in Casablanca from 18 to 25 March, and back to New York from 5 April to 1 May.{{sfn|Banks|2002|p=43}} In 1943, she was selected for a refit to become a main battery and escort training center.{{sfn|Banks|2002|p=36}} She arrived in [[Portland, Maine]] on 2 May, where she remained until 27 July.{{sfn|Banks|2002|p=43}} During her fourth and final refit in early 1943. Most of her secondary battery deck guns were removed and her anti-aircraft battery was increased to ten 3-inch/50 caliber guns, 24 40mm and 36 20mm guns. Improved fire control was added as well, and this ultimately increased her displacement to {{convert|29,340|t}} standard and {{convert|34,000|t}} full-load.{{sfn|Banks|2002|p=33}} She returned to Norfolk on 2 August 1943.{{sfn|Banks|2002|p=43}} She was used to train crews from the U.S. Navy, [[U.S. Coast Guard]], and Allied navies on the 14-inch/45 caliber gun, the 3-inch/50 caliber gun, and the 20mm and 40mm guns, primarily because many newer ships used these weapons. Between July 1943 and June 1944, about 11,000 enlisted men and 750 officers trained on her in this capacity.{{sfn|Banks|2002|p=36}} However, the duty lowered morale among the crew and a large number of requests for transfer were put in.{{sfn|Banks|2002|p=43}} Following this duty, she was sent to the [[U.S. Naval Academy]] and undertook three consecutive midshipmen cruises, ferrying a total of 1,800 cadets from Annapolis to [[Trinidad]]{{sfn|Banks|2002|p=37}} between June and August 1944.{{sfn|Banks|2002|p=44}}

=== Pacific theater ===
