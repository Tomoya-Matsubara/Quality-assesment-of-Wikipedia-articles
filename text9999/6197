He coached his then girlfriend [[Philipa Raschker]] (Phil and Phil), one of the most successful [[Masters athletics|Masters athletes]] ever.<ref>http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/06/sports/06master.html?pagewanted=all</ref>  Both Phils each were named the 1993 and 1994 [[USATF]] Combined Athletes of the year.<ref>http://www.usatf.org/statistics/Annual-Awards/TF/CombinedEventerAward.aspx</ref>
