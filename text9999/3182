The '''American lobster''', '''''Homarus americanus''''', is a [[species]] of [[lobster]] found on the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic coast]] of [[North America]], chiefly from [[Labrador]] to [[New Jersey]]. Within North America, it is also known as the ''northern lobster'' or ''Maine lobster''. It can reach a body length of {{convert|64|cm|abbr=on}}, and a [[mass]] of over {{convert|20|kg}}, making it the heaviest [[crustacean]] in the world. Its closest relative is the European lobster ''[[Homarus gammarus]]'', which can be distinguished by its coloration and the lack of spines on the underside of the [[rostrum (anatomy)|rostrum]]. American lobsters are usually bluish green to brown with red spines, but a number of color variations have been observed.

==Distribution==
''Homarus americanus'' is distributed along the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coast of [[North America]], from [[Labrador]] in the north to [[Cape Hatteras]], [[North Carolina]] in the south.<ref name="NOBANIS"/> South of [[New Jersey]], the species is uncommon, and landings in [[Delaware]], [[Maryland]], [[Virginia]] and North Carolina usually make up less than 0.1% of all landings.<ref>{{cite web |title=Demographic and Economic Trends in the Northeastern United States Lobster (''Homarus americanus'') Fishery, 1970<U+2013>2005 |author=Eric M.

The closest relative of ''H.&nbsp;americanus'' is the European lobster, ''[[Homarus gammarus]]''. The two species are very similar, and can be crossed artificially, although [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]] are unlikely to occur in the wild since their ranges do not overlap.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.imr.no/nyhetsarkiv/2010/mai/sensasjonell_hybrid_i_hummarverda/en |title=Unique lobster hybrid |author=Marie Hauge |date=May 2010 |publisher=[[Norwegian Institute of Marine Research]] |accessdate=September 30, 2010}}</ref> The two species can be distinguished by a number of characteristics:<ref name="CEFAS">{{cite web |title=Storage and care of live lobsters |author=T. W. Beard & D.

*The [[rostrum (anatomy)|rostrum]] of ''H.&nbsp;americanus'' bears one or more spines on the underside, which are lacking in ''H.&nbsp;gammarus''.
*The spines on the claws of ''H.&nbsp;americanus'' are red or red-tipped, while those of ''H.&nbsp;gammarus'' are white or white-tipped.
*The underside of the claw of ''H.&nbsp;americanus'' is orange or red, while that of ''H.&nbsp;gammarus'' is creamy white or very pale red.

===Head===
The [[antenna (biology)|antennae]] measure about {{convert|2|in|abbr=on}} long and split into Y-shaped structures with pointed tips. Each tip exhibits a dense zone of hair tufts staggered in a zigzag arrangement. These hairs are covered with multiple nerve cells that can detect odors. Larger, thicker hairs found along the edges control the flow of water, containing odor molecules, to the inner sensory hairs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://scicom.ucsc.edu/SciNotes/0201/lo/lobster/ |publisher=[[University of California, Santa Cruz]] |title=ScienceNotes2002 |accessdate=September 21, 2010}}</ref> The shorter [[antennule]]s provide a further sense of smell. By having a pair of [[olfactory]] organs, a lobster can locate the direction a smell comes from, much the same way humans can hear the direction a sound comes from. In addition to sensing smells, the antennules can judge water speed to improve direction finding.

Lobsters have two [[urinary bladder]]s, located on either side of the head. Lobsters use scents to communicate what and where they are, and those scents are in the [[urine]]. They project long plumes of urine {{convert|1|-|2|m|sp=us}} in front of them, and do so when they detect a rival or a potential mate in the area.<ref>{{cite book |author=Tristram D.

===Thorax===
The first pair of [[pereiopod]]s (legs) is armed with a large, asymmetrical pair of [[claw]]s.<ref name="MLW"/> The larger one is the "crusher", and has rounded nodules used for crushing prey; the other is the "cutter", which has sharp inner edges, and is used for holding or tearing the prey.<ref name="CEFAS">{{cite web |title=Storage and care of live lobsters |author=T.

Hardshells (lobsters that are several months past their last molt) can survive out of water for up to two days if kept refrigerated.

A set of nutcrackers and a long, thin tool for pulling meat from inaccessible areas are suggested as basics, although more experienced diners can eat the animal with their bare hands or a simple tool (a fork, knife or rock). Eating a lobster can get messy, and most restaurants offer a lobster bib.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://provincetown.com/restaurant_bar_review/dining_guide_provincetown/_/14745/ |title=Time to put on the lobster bib: Provincetown's restaurants stand at the ready |author=Kahrin Deines |date=July 9, 2008 |publisher=[[Provincetown.com]]}}</ref> Meat is generally contained in the larger claws and tails, and stays warm quite a while after being served. There is some meat in the legs and in the arms that connect the large claws to the body. There is also some small amount of meat just below the carapace around the thorax and in the smaller legs.

===North American lobster industry===
[[File:Guilford CT lobster traps.JPG|left|thumb|Lobster traps on [[Long Island Sound]] near [[Guilford, Connecticut]]]] 
{{See also|Lobster fishing}}
Most lobsters come from the northeastern coast of North America, with the [[Atlantic Provinces]] of Canada and the [[U.S. state]] of [[Maine]] being the largest producers. They are caught primarily using [[lobster trap]]s, although lobsters are also harvested as [[bycatch]] by [[Bottom trawling|bottom trawlers]], fishermen using [[gillnet]]s, and by scuba divers in some areas. Maine completely prohibits scuba divers from catching lobsters (violations could result in up to a $1000 fine). Massachusetts offers scuba divers lobster licenses for a fee, and they are only available to state residents. Rhode Island also requires divers to acquire a permit.

Lobster traps are rectangular cages made of vinyl-coated galvanized steel mesh or wood, with woven mesh entrances. These are baited and lowered to the sea floor. They allow a lobster to enter, but make it difficult for the larger specimens to turn around and exit. This allows the creatures to be captured alive. The traps, sometimes referred to as "pots", have a [[buoy]] floating on the surface, and lobstermen check their traps between one and seven days after setting them. The inefficiency of the trapping system has inadvertently prevented the lobster population from being overfished. Lobsters can easily escape the trap, and will defend the trap against other lobsters because it is a source of food. An estimated 10% of lobsters that encounter a trap enter, and only 6% will actually be caught.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.lobsters.unh.edu/LTV/LTV.HTM |title=Lobster Trap Video |publisher=[[University of New Hampshire]]}}</ref>

In the United States, the lobster industry is [[regulation|regulated]]. Every lobsterman is required to use a lobster gauge to measure the distance from the lobster's eye socket to the end of its carapace: if the lobster is less than {{convert|3.25|in}} long, it is too young to be sold and must be released back to the sea. There is also a legal maximum size of {{convert|5|in|abbr=on}} in Maine, meant to ensure the survival of a healthy breeding stock of adult males, but in parts of some states, such as Massachusetts, there is none. Also, traps must contain an escape hole or "vent", which allows juvenile lobsters and bycatch species to escape. The law in Maine and other states dictates a second large escape hole or "ghost panel" must be installed. This hole is held shut through use of biodegradable clips made of ferrous metal. Should the trap become lost, the trap eventually opens, allowing the catch to escape.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.maine.gov/dmr/bmp/noncomlob.htm#Trap%20Construction |publisher=Maine Department of Marine Resources |title=Noncommercial Lobster/Crab Harvesters}}</ref>

To protect known breeding females, lobsters caught carrying eggs are to be notched on a tail flipper (second from the right, if the lobster is right-side up and the tail is fully extended). Following this, the female cannot be kept or sold, and is commonly referred to as a "punch-tail" or as "v-notched". This notch remains for two molts of the lobster exoskeleton, providing harvest protection and continued breeding availability for up to five years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eregulations.com/massachusetts/fishing/saltwater/v-notching-regulations/ |title=V-Notching Regulations |publisher=[[Division of Fisheries and Wildlife (Massachusetts)]]}}</ref>

====Canada====
[[File:YarmouthNS FishingBoats.jpg|thumb|Fishing boats in [[Yarmouth, Nova Scotia]]]]
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, lobster fishing was the cause of troubles between [[Acadians]] and [[Mi'kmaq people|Mi'kmaq]] First Nations in the [[Canadian Maritimes]]. The Acadian economy (and identity) relied substantially on fisheries, especially lobster. In 1998, the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] ruled in favor of the First Nations and granted them unlimited rights to natural resources, based on an 18th-century treaty. The federal government tried to take licenses and quotas from the traditional fishermen, whose fishing quota had already dropped dramatically in the years before, and give them to the natives. [[Burnt Church]], a [[Indian reserve|reserve]] between [[Miramichi, New Brunswick|Miramichi]] and the Acadian town of [[Neguac]], was the hub of these troubles. The tension increased and decreased with each fishing season, reaching its climax came in April 2003, when a riot broke in the port of [[Shippagan]], where three native-owned fishing ships and a fish processing plant were burnt down. Since then, efforts have been made to bring Acadians and natives closer together, and the tension has slowly abated.<ref>{{cite video |title=Ceux qui Attendent |people=[[Herm<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>gilde Chiasson]] (director, narrator), C<U+00E9>cile Chevrier (producer) |date=2002 |publisher=[[National Film Board of Canada]] |url=http://www.onf-nfb.gc.ca/eng/collection/film/?id=51073 |medium=Documentary |language=French |trans_title=Those Who Wait}}</ref>

===Management===
American lobster tends to have a stable stock in northern (colder) waters, but gradually decreases in abundance moving southward. To manage lobster populations, more regulations and restrictions, geared towards achieving sustainable populations, are implemented gradually southward.<ref name="asmfc-american lobster">{{cite web |url=http://www.asmfc.org/americanLobster.htm |title=Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission: American Lobster |accessdate=June 30, 2009}}</ref>

==Ecology==
The American lobster thrives in cold, shallow waters where there are many rocks and other places to hide from predators. It typically lives at a depth of {{convert|4|-|50|m|abbr=on}}, but can be found up to {{convert|480|m|abbr=on}} below the surface.<ref name="MLW"/> It is both solitary and [[nocturnality|nocturnal]], and feeds on [[fish]], small [[crustacean]]s, and [[Mollusca|mollusks]].

===Diseases===
[[Gaffkaemia|Gaffkemia]] or red-tail is an extremely virulent infectious disease of lobsters caused by the bacterium ''Aerococcus viridans''.<ref name="Cawthorn">{{cite journal |author=Richard J. Cawthorn |year=2011 |title=Diseases of American lobsters (''Homarus americanus''): a review |journal=[[Journal of Invertebrate Pathology]] |volume=106 |issue=1 |pages=71<U+2013>78 |doi=10.1016/j.jip.2010.09.010 |pmid=21215356}}</ref> It only requires a few bacterial cells to cause death of otherwise healthy lobsters. The "red tail" common name refers to a dark orange discoloration of the ventral abdomen of affected lobsters. This is, in fact, the [[hemolymph]] or blood seen through the thin ventral arthrodial membranes. The red discoloration comes from [[astaxanthin]], a [[carotenoid]] pigment exported to the blood during times of stress. The same sign is also seen in other diseases of lobsters and appears to be a nonspecific stress response, possibly relating to the antioxidant and immunostimulatory properties of the astaxanthin molecule.

[[Paramoebiasis]] is an infectious disease of lobsters caused by infection with the sarcomastigophoran (ameba) ''[[Neoparamoeba]] pemaquidensis''. This organism also causes [[amoebic gill disease|amebic gill disease]] in farmed [[Atlantic salmon]], ''Salmo salar''. Infection occurs throughout the tissues, causing [[granuloma]]-like lesions, especially within the ventral nerve cord, the interstices of the [[hepatopancreas]] and the antennal gland. Paramoebiasis is strongly suspected to play a prominent role in the rapid die-off of American lobsters in [[Long Island Sound]] that occurred in the summer of 1999.<ref name="Cawthorn"/>

Systemic infections by the bacterium ''Vibrio fluvialis'' (or similar organisms) are reported to cause "limp lobster disease", wherein lobsters become lethargic and die.<ref name="Cawthorn"/><ref>{{cite journal |author=B.

Excretory calcinosis in American lobsters in Long Island Sound was described from an epizootic in 2002. The disease causes mineralized [[Calculus (medicine)|calculi]] to form in the antennal glands and gills. These cause a loss of surface area around the gills, and the lobster eventually asphyxiates. Several reasons have been proposed for the cause of a recent outbreak of the disease. The most generally attributed factor is an increased duration of warmer temperatures in the bottom of the Long Island Sound.<ref>{{cite journal |author=A. D. M.

==Taxonomy==
The American lobster was [[alpha taxonomy|first described]] by [[Thomas Say]] in 1817, with a [[type locality (biology)|type locality]] of "[[Long Branch, New Jersey|Long-branch]], part of the coast of [[New Jersey]]".<ref name="MLW"/> The name Say chose, however <U+2013> "''Astacus marinus''" <U+2013> was invalid as a [[junior homonym]] of ''Astacus marinus'' Fabricius, 1775, which is in turn a [[synonym (taxonomy)|junior synonym]] of ''[[Homarus gammarus]]''.<ref name="MLW"/> The American lobster was given its current [[scientific name]] of ''Homarus americanus'' by [[Henri Milne-Edwards]] in his 1837 work ''{{lang|fr|Histoire naturelles des Crustac<U+00E9>s}}'' (''"Natural History of the Crustacea"'').<ref name="MLW"/> The [[common name]] preferred by the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] is "American lobster", but the species is also known locally as the "northern lobster", "Maine lobster" or simply "lobster".<ref name="MLW"/>
