The band consists of three sisters Este, Danielle and Alana Haim, and drummer Dash Hutton. The group's pop sound on their studio work stands in contrast to the more rock-based music of their live shows.

The three sisters grew up in a musical family, and began playing instruments from an early age in cover bands with their parents. They began performing as Haim in 2007, but did not seriously consider a professional career for some years. Este graduated with a degree in Ethnomusicology, while Danielle became a successful touring guitarist with [[Jenny Lewis]] and [[The Strokes]]' frontman, [[Julian Casablancas]], on his solo tours. This led to Haim resuming as a full-time operation in 2012.

The group's first release, ''Forever'' (an EP released on a limited-time download), combined with good reception at the [[South by South West]] festival, led to a deal with [[Polydor Records]] and a management deal with [[Jay-Z]]'s [[Roc Nation]] group in mid-2012. The band began recording material for their first album, ''[[Days Are Gone]]'', in between touring, including appearances at the [[Glastonbury Festival]]. The album charted in the top ten in several countries, including a number one spot in the UK, and the group had won several "best of" awards by the end of 2013. The group were nominated for Best New Artist at the [[57th Annual Grammy Awards]] and are recording a second album.

The three sisters, Este Arielle Haim (b. March 14, 1986), Danielle Sari Haim (b. February 16, 1989) and Alana Mychal Haim (b.

Danielle and Este were members of the pop-rock group the Valli Girls,  and appeared on the soundtrack to the 2005 film ''[[The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants]]''.<ref name="weiner"/> Their song "Valli Nation" by the "SoCal teen prodigies" appeared on the 2005 [[Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards]] soundtrack alongside established musicians [[Avril Lavigne]], [[Alicia Keys]], [[Simple Plan]] and [[Good Charlotte]].<ref name="PRnewswire">{{cite news |title=So-Cal Teen Prodigies The Valli Girls Launch Pop-Rock Campaign |publisher=[[Columbia Records]] |location=[[New York City]], [[New York]] |url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/so-cal-teen-prodigies-the-valli-girls-launch-pop-rock-campaign-54307652.html |date=April 14, 2005 |accessdate=January 11, 2013}}</ref>

As they grew older, the sisters became more interested in incorporating pop and [[contemporary R&B]] into their music, and in 2007 they decided to form their own band.<ref name="weiner">{{cite journal|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/how-haims-three-geeky-sisters-became-the-years-coolest-new-band-20131112|title=How Haim's Three Geeky Sisters Became the Year's Coolest New Band|first=Jonah|last=Weiner|work=Rolling Stone|date=November 12, 2013|accessdate=October 20, 2014}}</ref> For their first gig, the trio played at a Jewish deli in Hollywood and were paid in [[matzah ball soup]].<ref name="Independent">{{cite news |first=Barry |last=Egan |title=Music: Haim <U+2013> Sisters of super sounds |newspaper=The Independent|url=http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/music/music-haim-sisters-of-super-sounds-29739021.html |date=November 10, 2013 |accessdate=May 19, 2014}}</ref> Early gigs were sparsely populated; Danielle recalled "we were bottom of the bill at 50 capacity venues and no-one would show up".<ref name="mccormick"/>

For the next five years, Haim played local venues but did not consider music as a professional career, since all three sisters were busy with other projects.

The group have rejected the "girl band" label, preferring to be respected as musicians on their individual merits. Alana stated, "When people call us a girl band, I take it as an insult <U+2013> being a girl in a band shouldn<U+2019>t be a thing.<U+201D><ref name="mclean"/> All three sisters are proficient on more than one instrument: Este plays both guitar and bass, Danielle plays guitar and drums, and Alana plays guitar, keyboards and percussion.<ref name="Shalom" /> For live performances, Este plays bass, Danielle plays lead guitar and sings lead vocals, and Alana plays rhythm guitar along with keyboards and percussion.

The band's live sound is different to that in the studio. Writing for ''NME'', Hazel Sheffield said that ''Days Are Gone'' "may confuse those won over by their raw, rocking live shows."<ref name="nmedog"/> Recordings demonstrate the group's vocal pop style, while the group play typical rock material such as Fleetwood Mac's "[[Oh Well (song)|Oh Well]]" in concert.<ref name="mccormick"/> The group's background in wedding bands from their days as Rockinhaim has led them to cover many different songs live and for radio sessions, including [[Miley Cyrus]]' "[[Wrecking Ball (Miley Cyrus song)|Wrecking Ball]]", [[Sheryl Crow]]'s "[[Strong Enough (Sheryl Crow song)|Strong Enough]]" and the Strokes' "You Only Live Once".<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2013/09/26/haim_covers_miley_cyrus_sheryl_crow_the_strokes_fleetwood_mac_mustang_sally.html|title=Haim Is Pop<U+2019>s Most Brilliant New Cover Band|first=Forrest|last=Wickman|work=Slate Magazine|date=September 26, 2013|accessdate=October 21, 2014}}</ref>  Este acts as the group's [[MC]] onstage, announcing most of the songs,<ref name="mccormick">{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/10343226/Haim-interview.html|title=Haim interview|first=Neil|last=McCormick|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=30 September 2013|accessdate=20 October 2014}}</ref> and has developed a reputation for her blunt and coarse banter with the audience and her amusing facial expressions (the "bass face") while playing.<ref name="Guardian20121124" />

Hutton has said that Este is his favourite bassist to play with. Though he declines to appear in press and publicity photos, he is nevertheless a full-time member of the band.<ref name="salon"/>

==Reception==
Critical reaction to Haim has been positive. [[PopMatters]]' Matt James wrote "It'd be hard to truly dislike Haim. They're an eminently likeable, albeit slightly kooky, trio whose story already bears the frisson of legend."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.popmatters.com/review/175596-haim-days-are-gone/|title=Haim: Days Are Gone |publisher=[[PopMatters]] |last=James |first=Matt |date=October 1, 2013 |accessdate=October 3, 2013}}</ref> Writing for ''[[The Guardian]]'', Alexis Petridis praised the band's songwriting abilities, saying it "has a certain kind of glossily depthless pop perfection down pat".<ref name="petridis"/> The band's sound has been described as "nu-folk-meets-nineties-R&B"<ref name="Vogue">{{cite news |first=Freddie |last=Campion |title=Band of the Week: HAIM |newspaper=[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]] |publisher=[[Cond<U+00E9> Nast Publications]] |location=[[New York City]], USA |url=http://www.vogue.com/culture/article/band-of-the-week-haim/#1 |date=February 28, 2012 |accessdate=December 12, 2012}}</ref> and "music that sounds like it was written on a lakeside retreat attended by [[Stevie Nicks]], [[John Waite]] and [[En Vogue]]".<ref name="Guardian20121124">{{cite news |first=Sam |last=Wolfson |title=Haim: 'Next time, why don't you come to Los Angeles?' |newspaper=The Guide ''supplement in'' [[The Guardian]] |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]] |location=[[London]], [[England]] |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/nov/24/haim-london-ellie-goulding |date=November 24, 2012 |accessdate=December 12, 2012}}</ref>

In her survey of pop music in 2013, ''[[The Observer|Observer]]'' critic [[Kitty Empire]] praised the band for "using the vector of harmonies to splice R&B with 1970s soft rock. They laid waste, too, to a herd of ghastly old hobby horses about guitar bands being unmarketable and record sales only being tied to women's state of undress."<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2013/dec/22/best-pop-music-2013-review| title = The best pop of 2013: Kitty Empire's choice| author = Empire, Kitty| date = December 22, 2013| accessdate = January 6, 2013| newspaper = The Guardian}}</ref>
