'''Kellie Loder''' (born 1988) is an [[Independent music|independent]] [[singer-songwriter]] from [[Newfoundland]] who plays drums, guitar and piano. She has released two [[Contemporary Christian music|Contemporary Christian]] albums: ''The Way'' in 2009 and ''Imperfections & Directions'' in 2010. With a voice that [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]]-based newspaper ''[[The Telegram]]'' has described as "powerful yet serene and soulful", she has won critical recognition at the annual [[MusicNL]] awards in Newfoundland, as well as the [[Juno Award]]s, Canada's top music prizes.

Having written her first song at age 16 about a cousin who died in a traffic accident, Loder was [[Nurse education|studying nursing]] at the [[Grenfell Campus]] of [[Memorial University of Newfoundland]] when she released ''The Way'' in August 2009. Later that year, she won a talent-search contest hosted by [[YC Newfoundland]], a Christian youth conference. As part of the award, Loder was given time with [[music industry]] and production professionals who helped her with ''Imperfections & Directions'', which was released at the 2010 YC Newfoundland. Loder's nursing studies hampered her ability to showcase ''Imperfections & Directions'' by touring. Loder was nominated as Female Artist of the Year at the 2010 MusicNL awards, and then as Gospel Artist of the Year in 2011. ''Imperfections & Directions'' was nominated as Contemporary Christian/Gospel Album of the Year at the [[Juno Awards of 2012|2012 Juno Awards]].

Loder's music career is unusual in that she chose to begin it in Contemporary Christian music (CCM); most young musicians choose [[music genre]]s such as [[Country music|country]] and [[pop music|pop]], which are generally considered more likely to bring commercial success. Loder has asserted that she chose CCM because it gives purpose to her music. In April 2012,  she had not decided whether she would focus on medicine or music, but by April 2013, she had made music her focus.

In early 2012 Loder made a [[music video]] for "Your Love Alone", one of the album's tracks, which was uploaded to [[YouTube]]. She confessed that she had written the song during a difficult phase in her life, and the song's lyrics revolve around the idea that the [[Grace (Christianity)|grace]] and [[Atonement in Christianity|mercy of God]] can be found in the most difficult situations. Through her experience, she became convinced that knowing God is all-important, expressing this concept in the chorus: "Your love alone is sufficient. It needs no company."<ref name=CBC/> She stated that she wrote the song "One Name Away" after having watched ''[[The Tyra Banks Show]]''. The episode featured an interview with a girl who had been [[Forced prostitution|forced into prostitution]] at a young age; despite smiling on screen, the girl hopelessly declared that she would probably die before she turned 22.<ref name=Badger/>

She wrote "Like a Flower" after a friend challenged her to imagine herself when she was a child and write a song to child self.<ref name=Crosstalk/>

Listeners unfamiliar with [[Contemporary Christian music]] (CCM) often assume that Loder sings [[hymn]]-style music. Her career is unusual in that it began in CCM; most young musicians choose [[music genre]]s such as [[Country music|country]] and [[Pop music|pop]], which are generally considered more likely to bring commercial success.<ref name=NTV>{{Cite AV media|publisher=[[CJON-DT]], ''NTV Evening News''|medium=Television broadcast|date=April 6, 2012, 6<U+2013>7 PM|title=''Juno nominee returns home''|author=Don Bradshaw|url=http://ntv.ca/juno-nominee-returns-home/|accessdate=December 26, 2012}}</ref> Loder has asserted that she chose CCM because it gives purpose to her music; many of her songs are about God, but they may also be interpreted as being about other subjects.<ref>For Loder's statement, see {{Cite AV media|publisher=[[CJON-DT]], ''NTV Evening News''|medium=Television broadcast|date=April 6, 2012, 6<U+2013>7 PM|title=''Juno nominee returns home''|author=Don Bradshaw|url=http://ntv.ca/juno-nominee-returns-home/|accessdate=December 26, 2012}}

In transitioning out of CCM, she wished to assure the public that she had "definitely not turned [her] back on [her] faith."<ref name=Crosstalk/> She believes that everything that she sings is for God, regardless of the song's subject.
