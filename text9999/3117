The video features a spoilt child being showered with Christmas presents while poorer children are shown in tears due to their lack of gifts. As the song ends [[Santa Claus]] is shown [[crucifixion|crucified]] on a cross.

==Origins and recording==

In a 2008 interview with ''[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]'' singer [[Gruff Rhys]] stated that "The Gift That Keeps Giving" was written as an "[[Album-oriented rock|AOR]] Christmas single" following a visit to [[Japan]] where "they celebrate Christmas as a commercial holiday with all the decorations .. in one store they had [[Santa Claus|Santa]] on a cross hanging from the wall ... so the Christmas single was just an excuse to have Santa on a cross on the cover"<ref name=Uncut /> (although the cover art did not in the end feature this scene, a [[Crucifixion|crucified]] Santa does appear in the accompanying music video)

Speaking to [[United Kingdom|British]] music magazine ''[[Artrocker]]'' Rhys offered another explanation as to the origins of the song: 

{{cquote|[[Geoff Travis]] asked us for one of our pop records, so we thought a pop record should have a Christmas single. And we'd been playing around with this phrase, because we'd had a [[Scotland|Scottish]] engineer who helped us make the 22 minute version of "[[The Man Don't Give a Fuck#Second single|The Man Don't Give a Fuck]]" and er... he always used to say 'it's the gift that keeps giving!' He was just referring to the length of the song... but we found out it's also a popular [[United States|American]] shopping phrase.<ref name=Artrocker />}}

The track was recorded at Miraval Studios, [[France]] along with the rest of ''Hey Venus!''<ref name=Linernotes>{{cite album-notes |title=Hey Venus! |albumlink=Hey Venus! |bandname=[[Super Furry Animals]] |year=2007 |notestitle= |url= |first= |last= |pages=[p.6] |format=CD booklet |publisher=[[Rough Trade Records]]|publisherid= |location=[[London]] |mbid=35ce5c2b-ab43-4f5a-885a-7b91b1c004bf}}</ref>

==Musical structure==

"The Gift That Keeps Giving" is 3 minutes 20 seconds long<ref name=Allmusic>{{cite web|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|title=Hey Venus!|work=[[Allmusic]]|date=[[2007]]?|url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:knfixz95ldfe|accessdate=2008-04-10}}</ref> and is in the key of [[D minor]]. 

The track begins with a [[Phaser (effect)|phased]] guitar melody backed only by [[synthesizer]], [[hi-hat]] and occasional guitar chords. [[Cian Ciaran|Cian Ciaran's]] piano joins the mix as the song builds up with the introduction of [[drum kit|drums]] at 25 seconds.

[[Gruff Rhys]] begins singing after 39 seconds and is joined by [[Jingle bell|sleighbells]] which accompany the lines "all the bells started ringing" shortly before the first chorus which features harmony backing vocals (the first of many in the "falsetto-laden" track<ref name=Pitchfork>{{cite web|last=Hogan|first=Marc|title=Hey Venus!|work=[[Pitchfork Media]]|date=[[2007-09-04]]|url=http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/45292-hey-venus|accessdate=2008-04-17}}</ref>) singing the title phrase. 

Another verse and chorus follow before an instrumental verse at 1 minute 46 seconds featuring a [[trumpet]] solo playing around the vocal melody.

The song "crescendos tenderly"<ref name=DIS>{{cite web|last=Dobson|first=Gareth|title=Super Furry Animals: Hey Venus!|work=[[Drowned in Sound]]|date=[[2007-08-27]]|url=http://www.drownedinsound.com/release/view/10895|accessdate=2008-04-10}}</ref> with a double chorus before entering the outro which initially includes spoken word backing vocals chanting "giving again" and is "enhanced by a horn section that the Furries seem to be able to utilise more effectively than anyone else".<ref name=DIS />

==Critical response==

Critical reaction to "The Gift That Keeps Giving" was generally positive with the ''[[NME|New Musical Express]]'' rating it as one of the best on parent album ''[[Hey Venus!]]''; "[it doesn't so much raise] the bar, as balances it on top of [[Snowdon|Mount Snowdon]]" going on to state:

{{cquote|From a foundation of [[Electric Light Orchestra|ELO]] [[guitar]] cloud-swells, Gruff's [[Elvis Costello]]-in-a-bubblegum-bath voice wraps around tender [[trombone]] parps to create the band's most beautiful moment since "[[Demons (Super Furry Animals song)|Demons]]".<ref name=NME2 />}}

[[BBC Wales]] commented on the track's Christmas links, describing "The Gift That Keeps Giving" as a "mellow, mellifluous, slow ode to the joys of the festive season ... lyrically incredibly simple ... brain-bendingly catchy".<ref name=BBCWales /> ''[[The Guardian]]'' meanwhile, stated that the song "might sound more [[California]] than Christmas" but still possesses the "obligatory sleighbells ... shaken throughout".<ref name=Guardian>{{cite web|last=Salmon|first=Chris|title=A season for giving|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=[[2007-12-21]]|url=http://music.guardian.co.uk/rock/story/0,,2230501,00.html|accessdate=2008-04-10}}</ref>

Much was made of the '[[Retro#Retro_Music|retro]]' nature of the track with [[Yahoo!|Yahoo Music UK]] claiming that the song as "a pure blue-eyed soul tune, of the sort that [[Dan Penn]] and [[Spooner Oldham]] used to churn out four decades ago"<ref name=Yahoo>{{cite web|last=Webb|first=Adam|title=Hey Venus|work=[[Yahoo!]]|date=[[2007-08-31]]|url=http://uk.launch.yahoo.com/070831/33/21i9m.html|accessdate=2008-04-17}}</ref> and ''The Guardian'' describing it as a "gorgeous, [[Burt Bacharach|Bacharach]]-tinged haze".<ref name=Guardian /> In contrast the ''[[UCSD Guardian]]'' described "The Gift That Keeps Giving" as "jazzy" and "lo-fi"  and saw it as "a throw-back to 2000's experimental ''[[Mwng]]''.<ref name=UCSDGuardian>{{cite web|last=Minden|first=Sonia|title=Hey Venus!|work=[[UCSD Guardian]]|date=[[2008-01-24]]|url=http://ucsdguardian.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=9449&Itemid=6|accessdate=2008-04-10}}</ref>

''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' noted that the "the group's penchant for sonic flourishes is used to subtle effect" on "The Gift That Keeps Giving" and went on to suggest that the track is representative of ''Hey Venus!'' as a whole.<ref name=Billboard>{{cite web|last=Carpenter|first=Troy|title=Hey Venus!|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=[[2007]]|url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/content_display/reviews/albums/e3i5852afde016b362420e9c5f2d877cf01|accessdate=2008-04-10}}</ref>

''Cokemachineglow'', however, thought that the song "will be cast into the void, one daring, lonely piece of the first Super Furry Animals album to not succeed as a thorough unit".<ref name=Cokemachineglow>{{cite web|last=Sinacola|first=Dom|title=Hey Venus!|work=Cokemachineglow|date=[[2007-08-31]]|url=http://www.cokemachineglow.com/record_review/1339/super-furry-animals|accessdate=2008-04-17}}</ref>

The band's decision to employ Japanese surrealist [[Keiichi Tanaami]] to produce the cover for ''Hey Venus!'' and its singles received some criticism <ref name=NME2 />, not least because the artist had already used similar designs. In a 2005 interview with [[Germany|German]] magazine ''Komakino'', [[Musical keyboard|keyboard player]] [[Cian Ciaran]] stated that the artwork for "The Gift..." ''was'' unique, however, and praised the artist.<ref name=Komakino>{{cite web|last=Jeganathan|first=Robin|title=Hey Cian!|work=Komakino|date=[[2007]]?|url=http://www.komakinomag.de/index.php?text:lang:super_furry_animals|accessdate=2008-04-10}}</ref>

==Music video==
[[Image:Gift-That-Keeps-Giving-SFA-Screenshot.jpg|thumb|200px|A screenshot from the music video]]
The video for "The Gift That Keeps Giving" was directed by Team D.A.D.D.Y.<ref name="milkandcookies" /> and revolves around a festive theme in keeping with the track's release date of [[Christmas]] day.

The video opens with a spoilt child opening numerous Christmas presents including a toy train, a box full of kittens and a copy of ''Hey Venus!'' (which he throws over his shoulder in disgust). Towards the end of the video less privileged children are shown crying at their lack of presents before we cut back to the initial child who is surrounded by gifts while [[Santa Claus]] is seen in front of a log fire, [[Crucifixion|crucified]] on a cross. An alternative ending instead features Santa lying on the floor with an arrow sticking out of his head. 

Despite the apparently cynical nature of the video, [[BBC Wales]] asserts that it is "not meant to be read in any deeper level than 'ain't Christmas brilliant?'"<ref name=BBCWales />
