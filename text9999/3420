'''Gwoyeu Romatzyh''' (literally "National [Language] [[Romanization]]"),<ref>{{zh-stp|s=<U+56FD><U+8BED><U+7F57><U+9A6C><U+5B57>|t=<U+570B><U+8A9E><U+7F85><U+99AC><U+5B57>|p=Gu<U+00F3>y<U+01D4> Lu<U+00F3>m<U+01CE>z<U+00EC>}}. In 1937 the  
sinologist Trittel coined the German translation "Lateinumschrift der Reichssprache" (DeFrancis[1950]: Ch 4, footnote 4).
</ref> abbreviated '''GR''', is a system for writing [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin Chinese]] in the [[Latin alphabet]]. The system was conceived by [[Yuen Ren Chao|Y.R. Chao]] and developed by a group of linguists including Chao and [[Lin Yutang]] from 1925 to 1926.  Chao himself later published influential [[#Texts|works in linguistics]] using GR.  In addition a small number of other textbooks and dictionaries in GR were published in Hong Kong and overseas from 1942 to 2000.

GR is unique among romanization systems in indicating the four [[Standard Mandarin#Tones|tones of Mandarin]] by varying the spelling of syllables ("tonal spelling").  These tones are a fundamental part of the Chinese language; they are considered to be a component of the word just as different letter sounds are recognized as different in the English, and determine the meanings of otherwise identical syllables.<ref>"A word pronounced in a wrong tone or inaccurate tone sounds as puzzling as if one said ''bud'' in English, meaning 'not good' or 'the thing one sleeps in.'" Chao(1948):24.</ref>  Other systems indicate the tones with either accents (for example [[Pinyin]]: ''<U+0101>i, <U+00E1>i, <U+01CE>i'' and ''<U+00E0>i'') or numbers ([[Wade-Giles]]: ''ai<sup>1</sup>, ai<sup>2</sup>'', etc.).  GR spells the same four tones ''ai'', ''ai<b>r</b>'', ''a<b>e</b>'' and ''a<b>y</b>''.<ref>In these examples ''air'' (''<U+00E1>i'') with a rising tone means "cancer", while ''ay'' (''<U+00E0>i'') with a falling tone means "love".</ref>  These spellings, which follow specific [[Spelling in Gwoyeu Romatzyh#Tonal rules|rules]], indicate the tones while retaining the pronunciation of the syllable ''ai''.  Because it embeds the tone of each syllable in its spelling,<ref>"The common [foreign] attitude of treating the tone as an [[epiphenomenon]] on top of the solid sounds<U+2014>consonants and vowels<U+2014>is to the Chinese mind quite unintelligible ..." Chao and Yang(1947):xv.</ref> GR may [[#Language learning|help students to master Chinese tones]]<U+2014>though some academics dispute this claim.<ref>"The results clearly indicated that GR did not lead to significantly greater accuracy in tonal production. Indeed, the use of GR reflected slightly lower rates of tonal production accuracy for native speakers of both American English and Japanese."  McGinnis(1997).</ref>

In 1928 China adopted GR as the nation's official romanization system. GR was used to indicate pronunciations in dictionaries of the National (Mandarin-based) Language.  Its proponents hoped one day to establish it as a writing system for a reformed Chinese script.  But despite support from a small number of trained linguists in China and overseas, GR met with public indifference and even hostility due to its complexity.<ref>For a detailed account of the historical background, see {{cite web | author = John DeFrancis | url= http://www.pinyin.info/readings/texts/DeFr1950.html | title= Chapter 4 of DeFrancis(1950) | publisher = pinyin.info | accessdate=2007-02-27}}</ref>  Another obstacle preventing its widespread adoption was the fact that it was too narrowly based on the Beijing dialect, in a period lacking a strong centralized government to enforce its use. Eventually GR lost ground to [[Pinyin]] and other later romanization systems. However, its influence is still evident, as several of the principles introduced by its creators have been used in romanization systems that followed it.

[[Image:Linyutang.jpg|thumb|left||[[Lin Yutang]], who first proposed tonal spelling]]

[[#Tonal rules|Tonal spelling]], Gwoyeu Romatzyh's most distinctive feature, was first suggested to Y.R Chao by [[Lin Yutang]].<ref>"Without disclaiming responsibility, as a very active member of the Committee on Unification, for the merits and defects of the system, I must give credit to my colleague Lin Yutang for the idea of varying the spelling to indicate difference in tone." Chao(1948):11 footnote.</ref><ref>For the historical background see {{cite web | author = John DeFrancis | url= http://www.pinyin.info/readings/texts/DeFr1950.html | title= One State, One People, One Language | publisher = Pinyin.info | accessdate=2007-02-27}} (Chapter 4 of DeFrancis[1950]).</ref>  By 1922 Chao had already established the main principles of GR.<ref>DeFrancis(1950): Ch 4, footnotes 43 and 46.</ref>  
The details of the system were developed in 1925-26 by a group of five linguists, led by Chao and including Lin, under the auspices of the [[Mandarin Promotion Council|Preparatory Commission for the Unification of the National Language]].<ref>DeFrancis(1950): 74</ref>  In 1928 GR was officially adopted by the government.<ref>Kratochv<U+00ED>l(1968):169</ref>  GR was intended to be used alongside the existing [[Zhuyin|''Juhin'' (''Zh<U+00F9>y<U+012B>n'')]] phonetic symbols: hence the alternative name for GR, "Second Pattern of the National Alphabet".<ref><U+56FD><U+97F3><U+5B57><U+6BCD><U+7B2C><U+4E8C><U+5F0F> / ''Gwoin Tzyhmuu Dihell Shyh'' / ''Gu<U+00F3>y<U+012B>n Z<U+00EC>m<U+01D4> D<U+00EC>'<U+00E8>r Sh<U+00EC>'': see Simon,W.(1947):Table X, lxxi.</ref>  Both systems were used to indicate the revised standard of pronunciation in the new official ''Vocabulary of National Pronunciation for Everyday Use'' of 1932.<ref><U+56FD><U+97F3><U+5E38><U+7528><U+5B57><U+6C47> / ''Gwoin Charngyonq Tzyhhuey'' / ''Gu<U+00F3>y<U+012B>n Ch<U+00E1>ngy<U+00F2>ng Z<U+00EC>hu<U+00EC>'': see Chao(1948):11.</ref>  The designers of GR had greater ambitions: their aim was complete reform of the script, using GR as a practical system of writing.<ref>"While the official position was that it was to be used whenever Chinese was to be spelt in Latin letters, such as in dealing with foreigners, those who devised the system, of whom I was one, had in our minds the design of a practical system of writing." Chao(1968c)</ref>
[[Image:Yr-chao.jpg|thumb|right|[[Yuen Ren Chao]], the chief designer of GR, as a young man ca. 1916]]
In the 1930s two shortlived attempts were made to teach GR to railway workers and peasants in [[Henan|H<U+00E9>n<U+00E1>n]] and [[Shandong|Sh<U+0101>nd<U+014D>ng]] provinces.<ref>DeFrancis(1950): 77-78</ref>  Support for GR, being confined to a small number of trained linguists and sinologists, "was distinguished more for its quality than its quantity".<ref>DeFrancis(1950): 75. The supporters included [[Qian Xuantong]] and [[Luo Changpei]] in China and [[Walter Simon]] in England.</ref>  During this period GR faced increasing hostility because of the complexity of its tonal spelling.  Conversely, the sinologist [[Bernhard Karlgren]] criticised GR for its lack of phonetic rigour.<ref>"[GR] is based on a series of very fatal phonetic lies, and for this reason it will be very difficult to learn, and consequently impractical." Karlgren(1928):20</ref> Ultimately, like the rival (toneless) system [[Latinxua Sinwenz]], GR failed to gain widespread support, principally because the "National" language was too narrowly based on [[Beijing dialect|Peking speech]]:<ref>DeFrancis(1950):76</ref> "a sufficiently precise and strong language norm had not yet become a reality in China".<ref>Kratochv<U+00ED>l(1968):169.</ref>

==Description==
{{main|Spelling in Gwoyeu Romatzyh}}

:''Note:'' In this section the word "tone" is abbreviated as "T": thus T1 stands for Tone 1 (first tone), etc.  To assist readers unfamiliar with GR, Pinyin equivalents have been added in brackets. 

=== Basic forms (Tone 1) ===
An important GR innovation, later adopted by [[Pinyin]], was to use contrasting [[voice (phonetics)|unvoiced/voiced]] pairs of consonants to represent [[aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated and unaspirated]] sounds in Chinese.<ref>See Chao(1948):19-24 and Chao(1968a):20-25 for tables and fuller discussion.  Complete tables  of GR initials and finals are also given in the [[Spelling in Gwoyeu Romatzyh#Basic forms|main article]].</ref>  For example ''b'' and ''p'' represent [[IPA]] [p] and [p<U+02B0>] (''p'' and ''p<U+2018>'' in Wade).  A potentially confusing feature of GR is the use of ''j'', ''ch'' and ''sh'' to represent two different series of sounds. When followed by ''i'' these letters correspond to the [[alveolo-palatal consonant|alveolo-palatal]] sounds  (Pinyin ''j'', ''q'', and ''x''); otherwise they correspond to the [[retroflex consonant|retroflex]] sounds (Pinyin ''zh'', ''ch'', and ''sh''). Readers used to Pinyin need to pay particular attention to these spellings: for example, GR ''ju'', ''jiu'' and ''jiou'' correspond to Pinyin ''zhu'', ''ju'' and ''jiu'' respectively.<ref>See the main article for a table showing the [[Spelling in Gwoyeu Romatzyh#Pinyin comparison: basic forms|correspondence of GR and Pinyin forms]].</ref>

GR orthography has these additional notable features:

* ''iu'' represents the [[close front rounded vowel]] (IPA {{IPA|y}}) spelt ''<U+00FC>'' or in many cases simply ''u'' in Pinyin.  
* Final ''-y'' represents [[allophone]]s of ''i'' ([[IPA]] {{IPA|<U+0290><U+0329>}}, {{IPA|z<U+0329>}} and {{IPA|<U+0279><U+0329>}}): GR ''shy'' and ''sy'' correspond to Pinyin ''shi'' and  ''si'' respectively. 
* ''el'' corresponds to Pinyin ''er'' (''-r'' being reserved to indicate T2). The most important use of ''-(e)l'' is as a [[R-colored vowel|rhotacization]] suffix, as in ''ideal'' = ''i dean'' + ''-(e)l'', "a little" (y<U+00EC>di<U+01CE>nr).
*A number of frequently-occurring [[morpheme]]s have abbreviated spellings in GR.  The commonest of these are: ''-g'' (-ge), ''-j'' (-zhe), ''-m'' (-me), ''sh'' (shi) and ''-tz'' (-zi).<ref>These and other abbreviations are listed in Chao(1968a):xxx.</ref>

=== Tonal modifications ===
By default, the basic GR spelling described above is used for T1 syllables.  The basic form is then modified to indicate tones 2, 3 and 4.<ref>The rules are given, though in a different form, in Chao (1948): 28-30 ([[synopsis]] p 336) and Chao (1968a): 29-30 (synopsis p 847).  See also Table IX in Simon,W.(1947):lviii.</ref> This is accomplished in one of three ways:

*'''either''' a vowel is changed to another vowel resembling it in sound (''i'' to ''y'', for example, or ''u'' to ''w'')

*'''or''' a letter is doubled

*'''or''' a silent letter (''r'' or ''h'') is added after the vowel.

Wherever possible the concise first method is used.  The following rules of thumb cover most cases.<ref>See the [[Spelling in Gwoyeu Romatzyh#Tonal rules|main article]] for a more thorough discussion.</ref>

'''Tone 1 (basic form)''' 

:''shiue, chuan, chang, hai, bau'' (xu<U+0113>, chu<U+0101>n, ch<U+0101>ng, h<U+0101>i, b<U+0101>o)

'''<span style="color:blue" id="T2Rule">Tone 2: i/u <U+2192> y/w; or add -r</span>'''
:''sh<span style="color:blue">y</span>ue, ch<span style="color:blue">w</span>an, cha<span style="color:blue">r</span>ng, hai<span style="color:blue">r</span>, bau<span style="color:blue">r</span>'' (xu<U+00E9>, chu<U+00E1>n, ch<U+00E1>ng, h<U+00E1>i, b<U+00E1>o)

'''<span style="color:fuchsia" id="T3Rule">Tone 3: i/u <U+2192> e/o; or double vowel</span>''' 

:''sh<span style="color:fuchsia">e</span>ue, ch<span style="color:fuchsia">o</span>an, ch<span style="color:fuchsia">aa</span>ng, ha<span style="color:fuchsia">e</span>, ba<span style="color:fuchsia">o</span>'' (xu<U+011B>, chu<U+01CE>n, ch<U+01CE>ng, h<U+01CE>i, b<U+01CE>o)

'''<span style="color:red">Tone 4: change/double final letter; or add -h</span>'''

:''shiue<span style="color:red">h</span>, chua<span style="color:red">nn</span>, cha<span style="color:red">nq</span>, ha<span style="color:red">y</span>, ba<span style="color:red">w</span>'' (xu<U+00E8>, chu<U+00E0>n, ch<U+00E0>ng, h<U+00E0>i, b<U+00E0>o)

'''Neutral tone: precede with a dot (full stop)'''

:''pe<span style="color:blue">r</span>ng.yeou, di<span style="color:red">h</span>.fang'' (p<U+00E9>ngyou, d<U+00EC>fang). 

'''Exception''' Syllables with an initial [[sonorant]] (''l-/m-/n-/r-'') use the basic form for T2 rather than T1.  In these syllables the (rarer) T1 is marked with ''-h-'' as the second letter.  For example ''mha'' is T1 (m<U+0101>), whereas ''ma'' is T2 (m<U+00E1>).<ref>Examples: (T1) ''Mha.mha'' (<U+5988><U+5988> M<U+0101>ma), "Mum"; (T2) ''mamuh'' (<U+9EBB><U+6728> m<U+00E1>m<U+00F9>), "numb".</ref>  T3 and T4 are regular: ''maa'' (m<U+01CE>) and ''mah'' (m<U+00E0>).

== Compounds as words ==

An important principle of GR is that syllables which form words should be written together. This strikes speakers of European languages as obvious; but in Chinese the concept of "word" is not easy to pin down.  The basic unit of speech is popularly thought to be the [[Written Chinese#Chinese characters (2)|character]] (<U+5B57> ''tzyh, z<U+00EC>''),<ref>Chao calls the character the "sociological word", since it is the unit by which children's vocabulary is measured, journalists are paid and telegrams charged for. Chao(1968a): 136.</ref> which represents a (meaningful) syllable or [[morpheme]], a smaller unit than the "linguistic word".<ref>For  thorough discussions, see Chao(1968a): 138-143 and Kratochv<U+00ED>l(1968):89-99.</ref>  Characters are written and printed with no spaces between words; yet in practice most [[Chinese language#Morphology|Chinese words]] consist of two-syllable compounds, and it was Chao's bold innovation in 1922 to reflect this in GR [[orthography]] by grouping the appropriate syllables together into words.<ref>DeFrancis(1950): Ch 4, note 46.</ref>  This represented a radical departure from hyphenated Wade-Giles forms such as  ''Kuo<sup>2</sup>-y<U+00FC><sup>3</sup> Lo<sup>2</sup>-ma<sup>3</sup>-tz<U+016D><sup>4</sup>'' (the Wade spelling of GR).  This principle, illustrated in the [[#Example|extract]] below, was later adopted in Pinyin.<ref>See also the [[Spelling in Gwoyeu Romatzyh#Pinyin comparison: all tones|table of Chinese provinces]] 
in the main article, comparing GR and Pinyin spellings.</ref>

== Texts ==

[[Yuen Ren Chao|Y.R. Chao]] used GR in four influential works:
*''A Concise Dictionary of Spoken Chinese'' (in collaboration with Lien Sheng Yang) (1947)
*''Mandarin Primer''<ref>Recordings, including online excerpts, of this lively, though now rather dated, text are available from 
{{cite web | author = Yuen Ren Chao | url= http://www.folkways.si.edu/search/AlbumDetails.aspx?ID=1407# | title= Mandarin Primer | publisher = Smithsonian Folkways Recordings | accessdate=2007-02-27}}.</ref> (1948)
:This course was originally used in the [[Army Specialized Training Program]] at the [[Harvard University|Harvard]] School for Overseas Administration in 1943-44 and subsequently in civilian courses.<ref>Chao(1948):v.</ref>
*''A Grammar of Spoken Chinese''<ref>"The most comprehensive grammar of MSC [Modern Standard Chinese] in English." Kratochv<U+00ED>l(1968):187.</ref> (1968a)
*<div id="sayable">''Readings in Sayable Chinese''<ref>Cassette recordings of this text are available from various online sources.</ref> (1968b) <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[#Example|Extract]]<nowiki>]</nowiki></div>  "Sayable" in this context means colloquial,<ref>Chao describes the colloquial Chinese heard on the street as "sayable, even if sometimes unspeakable". (Chao 1968b): I,vi)</ref> as opposed to the [[vernacular Chinese]] (''bairhuah'', Pinyin ''b<U+00E1>ihu<U+00E0>'') style often read by students.

''Readings in Sayable Chinese'' was written "to supply the advanced student of spoken Chinese with reading matter which he can actually use in his speech".<ref>Chao(1968b): I,iv</ref>  It consists of three volumes of Chinese text with facing GR romanization.<ref>{{cite web | author = Yuen Ren Chao | url= http://www.pinyin.info/readings/sayable_chinese.html | title= Readings in Sayable Chinese: table of contents | publisher = pinyin.info | accessdate=2007-03-02}}</ref>  They contain some lively recorded dialogues, "Fragments of an autobiography", two plays and a translation of [[Lewis Carroll]]'s ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]] (Tzoou daw Jinqtz lii)''.<ref> <U+8D70><U+5230><U+93E1><U+5B50><U+88E1><U+8DDF><U+963F><U+9E97><U+601D><U+770B><U+898B><U+88E1><U+982D><U+6709><U+4E9B><U+4EC0><U+9EBC> ''Tzoou daw Jinqtz lii gen Alihsy Kannjiann Liitou Yeou Shie Sherme / Z<U+01D2>u d<U+00E0>o j<U+00EC>ngzili g<U+0113>n <U+0100>l<U+00EC>s<U+012B> k<U+00E0>njian l<U+01D0>tou y<U+01D2>u xi<U+0113> sh<U+00E9>nme''.</ref>  Two extracts from ''Tzoou daw Jinqtz lii'' with facing translations can be read online.<ref>The extracts comprise Alice's conversations with Tweedledum and Tweedledee ({{cite web | author = Lewis Carroll [Y.R. Chao trans.] | url= http://home.iprimus.com.au/richwarm/gr/tweedle.htm | title= Yuen Ren Chao in Wonderland | publisher = Richard Warmington | accessdate=2007-03-12}}) and Humpty Dumpty ({{cite web | author = Lewis Carroll [Y.R.

The second webpage also includes a version of the text in Pinyin.</ref>

In 1942 [[Walter Simon]] introduced GR to English-speaking sinologists in a special pamphlet, ''The New Official Chinese Latin Script''.  Over the remainder of the 1940s he published a series of textbooks and readers,<ref>See the [[Walter Simon#Publications on Chinese Linguistics|complete list]] of these publications.</ref> as well as a Chinese-English Dictionary, all using GR.  His son Harry Simon later went on to use GR in scholarly papers on Chinese linguistics.<ref>See for example Simon, H.F.(1958).</ref> 

[[Lin Yutang]]'s Chinese-English dictionary (1972) incorporated a number of innovative features, one of which was a simplified version of GR.<ref name="lindict">"In the original edition, 'Guoryuu Romatzyh' (<U+570B><U+8A9E><U+7F85><U+99AC><U+5B57>) was used as the scheme for romanization."  Another feature was an "Instant Index System": "an invention by Lin Yutang with the intention of providing a simple and unambiguous rule to call up any given Chinese character ... [T]his index system has not been widely used since its inception."  {{cite web | author = Lin Yutang | url = http://humanum.arts.cuhk.edu.hk/Lexis/Lindict/lyt-fl.htm | title = Chinese-English Dictionary of Modern Usage (Online Version) | publisher = Chinese University of Hong Kong | accessdate=2007-03-27}}</ref><ref>Ching(1975).</ref>  Lin eliminated most of the spelling rules requiring substitution of vowels, as can be seen from his spelling ''Guo<span style="color:blue">r</span>y<span style="color:fuchsia">uu</span> Romatzyh'',<ref name="lindict"/> in which the regular [[#T2Rule|''-r'' is used for T2]] and a [[#T3Rule|doubled vowel for T3]].

== Language learning ==

Most learners of Chinese now start with Hanyu Pinyin, which is easier to learn than GR.<ref>Chao's own, perhaps optimistic, assessment was that "Learning the rules of the National orthography [ie GR] takes about two weeks longer than other systems ..." Chao and Yang(1947):xix.</ref>  But GR has its advantages. According to Y.R. Chao:

<blockquote>[GR] makes the spelling more complicated, but gives an ''individuality to the physiognomy of words'', with which it is possible to associate meaning ... [A]s an instrument of teaching, tonal spelling has proved in practice to be a most powerful aid in enabling the student to grasp the material with precision and clearness.<ref>Chao(1948):11 (emphasis added).</ref></blockquote>

For example, it may be easier to memorize the difference between GR ''Beeijing'' (the city) and ''beyjiing'' ("background") than the Pinyin versions ''B<U+011B>ij<U+012B>ng'' and ''b<U+00E8>ij<U+01D0>ng'', where the tones seem to be almost an afterthought.   

Not all teachers are convinced of the superiority of GR as a means of teaching correct tones to learners.  One study conducted at the [[University of Oregon]] in 1991-1993 compared the results of using Pinyin and GR in teaching elementary level Chinese to two matched groups of students.  It concluded that "GR did not lead to significantly greater accuracy in tonal production".<ref>McGinnis(1997)</ref>

GR continues to be used by some teachers of Chinese.  In 2000, the Princeton ''Chinese Primer'' series was published in both GR and Pinyin versions.<ref>Ch'en et al.(2000)</ref>  GR is used as the main romanization method in some university departments, for example the East Asian Studies Program at [[Bucknell University]] in Pennsylvania.<ref>
{{cite web | author = Anne Pusey | url= http://www.facstaff.bucknell.edu/apusey/materials.html | title= Chinese Language Materials | publisher = Bucknell University Course websites | accessdate=2007-02-27}}  This useful website includes tonal dictation exercises and a PowerPoint presentation illustrating the GR tonal rules.</ref>

<span id="eng">English translation</span>:
:The term "Sinology" carries a slight overtone of disrespect towards China.  One hears of "Indology", "Egyptology" and "Sinology", but never "Graecology" or "Romology"<U+2014>let alone "Anglology" or "Americology".  The term "Sinology" epitomizes European and American scholars' patronizing attitude towards the culture of those ruined ancient empires.
