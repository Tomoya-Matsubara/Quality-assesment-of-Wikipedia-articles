The '''Potez 220''' was a prototype French twin-engined, three-seat [[Reconnaissance aircraft|reconnaissance]] and [[army cooperation aircraft]]. Two examples were built in 1939, but no production followed.

==Design and development==
On 6 February 1937, the French air ministry issued specification A.24 for a three-seat reconnaissance and army-cooperation aircraft.<ref name="Greenv8 p64">Green 1967, p. 64.</ref> To meet this requirement, the nationalised Soci<U+00E9>t<U+00E9> Nationale de Constructions A<U+00E9>ronautiques du Nord ([[SNCAN]]), formed in January 1937 from [[ANF Les Mureaux]], [[Potez]], [[Chantiers A<U+00E9>ro-Maritimes de la Seine]] and parts of [[Breguet Aviation|Breguet]] and [[Avions Amiot|Amiot]],<ref name="Gun-man p337">Gunston 2005, p. 337.</ref> gave the task to the design team inherited from Les Mureaux. Their design, the Potez 220{{#tag:ref|All SNCAN designs, no matter what part of the conglomerate they originated from, were named as Potez aircraft owing to the prestige associated with the name.<ref name="Greenv8 p64"/><ref name="Breff p80">Breffort and Jouineau 2005, p. 80.</ref>|group=lower-alpha}} was a twin-engined [[monoplane]] of all metal construction. The [[fuselage]] was an oval section [[monocoque]], which accommodated the aircraft's crew of three, consisting of a pilot, a radio operator gunner and an observer, with a glazed gondola slung under the fuselage provided for the observer. It was powered by two {{convert|700|hp|kW|disp=flip|abbr=on}} [[Gnome-Rh<U+00F4>ne 14M]] [[radial engine]]s driving three-bladed propellers, which were fed from fuel tanks located within the wing. A retractable [[conventional landing gear|tailwheel undercarriage]] was fitted.<ref name="Greenv8 p65-6">Green 1967, pp. 65<U+2013>66.</ref><ref name="Breff p80-1">Breffort and Jouineau 2005, pp. 80<U+2013>81.</ref>

The first prototype made its maiden flight at [[Sartrouville]] on 7 April 1939, with the second prototype following on 20 October that year. Performance was slightly better than the [[Potez 63|Potez 63.11]] which had recently entered production in the reconnaissance role, while orders had also been placed for the much more powerful and better performing [[Bloch 174]] and [[Martin Maryland|Martin 167F]] aircraft to meet the same requirement as the Potez 220. Development of the type was therefore abandoned.<ref name="Greenv8 p64,6">Green 1967, pp. 64, 66.</ref>
