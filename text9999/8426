'''Tropical Storm Allison''' was a [[tropical cyclone#Intensity classifications|tropical storm]] that devastated southeast [[Texas]] in June of the [[2001 Atlantic hurricane season]]. The first storm of the season, Allison lasted unusually long for a June storm, remaining tropical or subtropical for 15 days. The storm developed from a [[tropical wave]] in the northern [[Gulf of Mexico]] on [[June 4]], and struck the northern [[Texas]] coast shortly thereafter. It drifted northward through the state, then turned back to the south and re-entered the Gulf of Mexico. The storm continued to the east-northeast, making landfall on [[Louisiana]] and then moving across the southeast [[United States]] and [[Mid-Atlantic]]. Allison was the first storm since [[Tropical Storm Frances (1998)|Tropical Storm Frances]] in 1998 to strike the upper Texas coastline.<ref name="ivey">{{cite web|author=John P. Ivey|year=2002|title=Flood Safety and Tropical Storm Allison|accessdate=2006-05-15|url=http://www.floodsafety.com/media/pdfs/texas/ivey.pdf}}</ref>

The storm dropped heavy rainfall along its path, peaking at over 40&nbsp;[[inch]]es (1000&nbsp;[[mm]]) in Texas. The worst of the flooding occurred in [[Houston, Texas|Houston]], where most of Allison's damage occurred. There, 30,000 became homeless after the flooding destroyed 2,744 homes. Downtown Houston was inundated with flooding, causing severe damage to hospitals and businesses. 23 people died in Texas. Throughout its entire path, Allison caused $6.05&nbsp;billion (2006 USD) in damage and 41 deaths. Aside from Texas, the places worst hit were [[Louisiana]] and southeastern [[Pennsylvania]]. 

Following the storm, President [[George W. Bush]] declared 75 counties along Allison's path as disaster areas, which allowed the affected citizens to apply for aid. Allison is the only tropical storm to have its name retired without ever reaching hurricane strength.

==Storm history==
{{storm path|Allison 2001 track.png}}
A tropical wave moved off the coast of [[Africa]] on [[May 21]]. It moved westward across the shear-ridden [[Atlantic Ocean]], retaining little convection on its way. After moving across [[South America]] and the southwestern [[Caribbean Sea]], the wave entered the eastern North [[Pacific Ocean]] on [[June 1]]. A low level circulation developed on the 2nd while 230&nbsp;miles (370&nbsp;km) south-southeast of [[Salina Cruz]], [[Mexico]]. Southerly flow forced the system northward, and the wave moved inland on the 3rd. The low-level circulation dissipated, though the mid-level circulation persisted. It emerged into the [[Gulf of Mexico]] on the 4th, and developed deep convection on its eastern side. On [[June 5]], the mid-level circulation extended to the surface, and organized into Tropical Storm Allison while just 140&nbsp;miles (225&nbsp;km) to the south of [[Galveston, Texas]].<ref name="tcr">{{cite web|author=National Hurricane Center|year=2001|title=Tropical Storm Allison Tropical Cyclone Report|accessdate=2006-05-15|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/2001allison.html}}</ref>

[[Image:Tropical Storm Allison- Eye.jpg|right|thumb|Tropical Storm Allison with an [[Eye (cyclone)|eye]]-like feature over Mississippi]]
Allison initially had [[subtropical cyclone|subtropical characteristics]] with an upper level low to the southwest of the circulation. Despite this, the storm quickly strengthened to a 60&nbsp;mph (95&nbsp;km/h) storm, though tropical storm force winds extended up to 230&nbsp;miles (370&nbsp;km) east of the center. Allison weakened while nearing the Texas coastline, and struck near [[Freeport, Texas]] as a 50&nbsp;mph (80&nbsp;km/h) tropical storm late on [[June 5]].<ref name="tcr"/> The storm quickly weakened over land, and the National Hurricane Center discontinued advisories early on the 6th.<ref name="disc4">{{cite web|author=National Hurricane Center|year=2001|title=Tropical Storm Allison Discussion #4|accessdate=2006-05-15|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2001/dis/al012001.discus.004.html}}</ref> The depression drifted northward until reaching [[Lufkin, Texas]], where it stalled due to a high pressure system to its north. On [[June 8]], the depression drifted to the south, then to the southwest. Early on the 10th, Allison again reached the [[Gulf of Mexico]] just 22&nbsp;miles (35&nbsp;km) west of its original landfall location. Due to dry air and moderate westerly wind shear, the storm transformed into a subtropical cyclone. While the subtropical depression moved eastward, a new low level circulation redeveloped to the east, and Allison quickly made landfall on [[Morgan City, Louisiana]] on the 11th. Strong thunderstorms redeveloped over the circulation, and Allison strengthened into a subtropical storm over southeastern [[Louisiana]].<ref name="tcr"/>

[[Image:Tropical Storm Allison- SC.JPG|left|thumb|Allison over South Carolina]]
Allison re-strengthened to reach winds of 45&nbsp;mph (72&nbsp;km/h), and an eyewall feature briefly existed. The feature was transient, and Allison quickly weakened back to a tropical depression. The depression tracked to the east-northeast through [[Mississippi]], [[Alabama]], [[Georgia (U.S. State)|Georgia]], and [[South Carolina]] before becoming nearly stationary near [[Wilmington, North Carolina]]. It drifted through the state, and accelerated to the northeast in response to an approaching cold front. Allison reached the Atlantic Ocean on [[June 17]], and briefly reintensified to a [[subtropical storm]] through baroclinic processes. Allison became extratropical while south of [[Long Island]] on the 18th, and was absorbed by the cold front on the 19th.<ref name="tcr"/>

==Preparations==
Shortly after forming, officials in [[Galveston County, Texas]] issued a voluntary evacuation for the western end of [[Galveston Island]]. This was due to fears of coastal flooding, as the area was not protected by the [[Galveston Seawall]].<ref name="tcr"/> The ferry from the island to the [[Bolivar Peninsula]] was closed, while voluntary evacuations were issued in [[Surfside Beach, Texas|Surfside]] in [[Brazoria County, Texas|Brazoria County]].<ref name="nws1">{{cite web|author=Houston/Galveston National Weather Service|year=2001|title=Hurricane Local Statement (1)|accessdate=2006-05-15|url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/hgx/projects/allison01/textproducts/HLSHOU.1.txt}}</ref> Voluntary evacuations were also suggested near [[Sabine Pass]] in [[Jefferson County, Texas]], though few left.<ref name="nws2">{{cite web|author=Lake Charles National Weather Service|year=2001|title=Hurricane Local Statement (2)|accessdate=2006-05-15|url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/hgx/projects/allison01/textproducts/NEWPSHLCH.1.txt}}</ref> Also, when the [[National Hurricane Center]] issued the first advisory on Allison, officials issued [[Tropical cyclone watches and warnings|Tropical Storm Warnings]] from [[Sargent, Texas]] to [[Morgan City, Louisiana]],<ref name="disc1">{{cite web|author=National Hurricane Center|year=2001|title=Tropical Storm Allison Discussion #1|accessdate=2006-05-15|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2001/pub/al012001.public.001.html}}</ref> just 3 hours before tropical storm winds were observed.<ref name="tcr"/> 

After the storm made landfall, [[flash flood]] watches and warnings were issued for numerous areas in eastern Texas.

In addition, there were only nine warnings that were false alarms. With an average lead time of 24&nbsp;minutes, the National Weather Service in [[Lake Charles, Louisiana]] issued 47&nbsp;flash flood warnings, of which eleven were false alarms. One flash flood occurred outside of the warning area. With an average lead time of 39&nbsp;minutes, the National Weather Service in New Orleans/Baton Rouge issued 87&nbsp;flash flood warnings, of which 30 were not followed by a flash flood. In addition, there were five flash floods not covered in the warning area.<ref name="nws">{{cite web|author=United States Department of Commerce|year=2001|title=Tropical Storm Allison Heavy Rains and Floods in Texas and Louisiana|accessdate=2006-05-15|url=http://www.nws.noaa.gov/om/assessments/pdfs/allison.pdf}}</ref>

In [[Tallahassee, Florida]], a shelter was opened the day prior to Allison moving north through the area, with seven staff members housing 12&nbsp;people. Two other shelters were put on standby. Teams informed citizens in the [[Florida Panhandle]] of flood dangers.<ref name=flalpre">{{cite web|author=United States Red Cross|year=2001|title=Tropical Storm Allison Florida Situation Report|accessdate-May 18|accessyear=2006|url=http://www.tallytown.com/redcross/situation/allison-01.pdf}}</ref>

Tropical Storm Allison was a major flooding disaster throughout its path from [[Texas]] to the Mid-Atlantic. The worst of the flooding occurred in [[Houston, Texas]], where over 35&nbsp;inches (890&nbsp;mm) of rain fell. Allison killed 41&nbsp;people, of which 27 drowned from the flooding. The storm also caused over $5&nbsp;billion in damage (2001 USD, $6.05&nbsp;billion 2006 USD), making Allison the deadliest and costliest tropical storm on record in the United States.<ref name="tcr"/>

===Texas===
Allison made landfall with a storm surge of two to three feet. Combined with waves on top, areas of [[Galveston Island]] experienced a wall of water 8&nbsp;feet (2.5&nbsp;m) in height, creating [[overwash]] along the coastline. The storm caused winds of up to 43&nbsp;mph (69&nbsp;km/h) at the Galveston Pier. While Allison was stalling over Texas, it dropped heavy rainfall across the state, including 9.77&nbsp;inches (248&nbsp;mm) in Galveston, 12.13&nbsp;inches (308&nbsp;mm) in [[Jamaica Beach, Texas]], and other similar totals along the coast.<ref name="tcr"/> Minimal beach erosion was reported.<ref name="hogaprelim">{{cite web|author=Houston/Galveston National Weather Service|year=2001|title=Preliminary Report (Houston/Galveston)|accessdate=2006-05-17|url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/hgx/projects/allison01/textproducts/SATPSHHOU.txt}}</ref> Impact was minimal near the coast.<ref name="sd06">{{cite web|author=National Climatic Data Center|year=2001|title=Storm Data and Unusual Weather Phenomena (June 2001)|accessdate=2006-05-17|url=http://maestro.srcc.lsu.edu/softlib/sd/sd0106.pdf}}</ref>

While moving northward through [[Texas]] as a minimal tropical depression, Allison produced minor wind gusts.<ref name="tcr"/> Shortly after making landfall, the storm spawned a tornado in [[Manvel, Texas|Manvel]] of [[Brazoria County, Texas|Brazoria County]], causing damage to one home.<ref name="sd06"/> Within hours of making landfall, rainfall totals of 8 to 12 inches (200 to 300&nbsp;mm) were common in Galveston and [[Harris County, Texas|Harris County]].

[[Image:TS Allison Texas flooding.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Flooding from Allison]]
[[Houston]] experienced torrential rainfall in a short amount of time. 6.3&nbsp;inches (160&nbsp;mm) fell in just one hour, while 28.5&nbsp;inches (724&nbsp;mm) fell in only 12&nbsp;hours. The six-day rainfall in Houston amounted to 38.6&nbsp;inches (980&nbsp;mm).<ref name="rms">{{cite web|author=Risk Management Solutions|year=2001|title=Tropical Storm Allison Event Report|accessdate=May 18|accessyear=2006|url=http://www.rms.com/Publications/TS_Allison.pdf}}</ref> Two-thirds of the bayous and creeks in Harris County experienced 500-year flood events. Houston, which typically receives 46.07&nbsp;inches (1170&nbsp;mm) of rain in a year, experienced 35.7% of its expected total in the first nine days of June.<ref name="ivey"/>

The deluge of rainfall flooded 95,000&nbsp;automobiles and 73,000&nbsp;houses throughout Harris County.<ref name="ivey"/> Tropical Storm Allison destroyed 2,744&nbsp;homes, leaving 30,000&nbsp;homeless with residential damages totaling to $1.76&nbsp;billion (2001 USD, $1.94&nbsp;billion 2006 USD). Residential neighborhoods inside and to the north of [[Interstate 610 (Texas)|Interstate 610]] were hardest hit.<ref name="rms"/>

[[Image:Tropical_Storm_Allison.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Downtown Houston after Allison. Buffalo Bayou has overflowed, marooning the [[University of Houston<U+2013>Downtown]] building on the left-center.]]
Several hospitals in the [[Texas Medical Center]] experienced severe damage from the storm. When the serious flooding began on [[June 9]], hospitals evacuated more than 1,000&nbsp;patients. The flooding occurred through below-grade pedestrian tunnels that link many major buildings. Most lost power and backup power when basements, the area where power and research data were kept, flooded. The [[Baylor College of Medicine]] experienced the worst of the damage, totaling to $495&nbsp;million (2001 USD, $547&nbsp;million 2006 USD). There, the hospital lost 90,000&nbsp;research animals, 60,000&nbsp;tumor samples, and 25&nbsp;years of research data. Throughout the Medical center, damage totaled to over $2&nbsp;billion (2001 USD, $2.2&nbsp;billion 2006 USD). Most were reopened after a month, though it took much longer to become fully operational.<ref name="rms"/>

The [[Houston Downtown Tunnel System|underground tunnel system]], which connects most large office buildings in Downtown Houston, was submerged, as were many streets and parking garages adjacent to the [[Buffalo Bayou]]. At the Theatre District, also in downtown, the Houston Symphony, Houston Grand Opera, and Alley Theater lost millions of dollars of costumes, musical instruments, sheet music, archives and other artifacts. Local television stations ran all-night coverage of the deluge from [[June 8]] through the next day, including [[KHOU-TV]] 11, which was forced to transmit its broadcast to a satellite truck when floodwaters entered its production studio. By midnight [[June 9]] nearly every freeway and major road in the city was underwater, forcing hundreds of motorists to abandon their vehicles for higher ground.<ref name="rms"/>

Despite massive flooding damage to entire neighborhoods there were no drowning deaths in flooded homes. In the area, there were 12&nbsp;deaths from driving, 6 from walking, 3 from electrocution, and 1 in an elevator.<ref name="ivey"/> Elsewhere in Texas, a man drowned when swimming in a ditch in [[Mauriceville, Texas|Mauriceville]].<ref name="nws"/> Damage totaled to $5.2&nbsp;billion (2001 USD, $5.7&nbsp;billion 2006 USD) throughout [[Texas]].<ref name="texasdamage">{{cite web|author=National Climatic Data Center|year=2001|title=Event Report for Texas|accessdate=2006-06-07|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~450007}}</ref>

Though Allison's flooding was extreme, it was not unprecedented. [[Tropical Storm Amelia (1978)|Tropical Storm Amelia]] in 1978 dropped over 46&nbsp;inches (1170&nbsp;mm) of rainfall in [[Bluff, Texas]], which remains the record highest rainfall for a single storm in the state of Texas.

==Retirement==
{{seealso|List of retired Atlantic hurricanes}}
The name Allison was retired in the spring of 2002 and will never again be used in the [[Atlantic basin]]; the 2001 incarnation of Allison is the only Atlantic tropical system ever to have its name retired without ever reaching hurricane strength.  The name will be replaced with Andrea in the {{tcseason|2007|Atlantic|hurricane}}.
