'''Lusitanic''' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] '''Lusit<U+00E2>nico'''), from [[Latin language|Latin]] '''Lusitanicus''', adjective from '''[[Lusitania]]''', the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] name within the [[Iberian Peninsula]])  is a term used to categorize persons who share the linguistic and cultural traditions of the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]. 
However, when the modern day country of [[Portugal]] was created in the [[12th century]], it inherited the term, and thus, since then, Lusitanic is also related to [[Portugal]], its [[Portuguese people|people]] and its [[Culture of Portugal|culture]].
In this process, the part of [[Spain]] that was also within the province of Lusitania was excluded from the term.

The term is not based specifically on race or ethnicity, but rather on a shared cultural and/or linguistic heritage. It is not commonly used outside Portugal and by people of Portuguese descent, nor recognised in everyday usage within the English speaking world.  
The term [[Anglo]], however, when used to describe [[Anglosphere|English speaking]] nations is less comparable with a strong exception to [[Canada]] which shares both English and French language cultures.

The term can be easily compared to ''[[Hispanic]]'' - as this term describes those who speak the [[Spanish language]], have Spanish ancestry from a [[Hispanophone|Spanish speaking]] nation or otherwise have cultural ties to Spanish speaking nations.

==Etymology==

The term derives from the name of one tribe, the [[Lusitani]], that lived in the Western part of the [[Iberian Peninsula]], prior to the Roman conquest; the lands they inhabited were known as [[Lusitania]]. The [[Lusitani]] were mentioned for the first time, by [[Livy]], as [[Carthaginian]] mercenaries who incorporated the army of [[Hannibal]], when he fought the Romans.
 
After the conquest of the peninsula (25-20 BC) [[Augustus]] divided it into the southwestern [[Hispania Baetica]] and the western [[Provincia Lusitana]] that included the territories of [[Asturia]] and [[Gallaecia]], celtic regions. In 27 BC the Emperor [[Augustus]] made a smaller division of the province: Asturia and Gallaecia were ceded to the jurisdiction of the new [[Provincia Tarraconensis]], the former remained as Provincia Lusitania et Vettones. The Roman province of [[Lusitania]] comprised what is now central and south [[Portugal]] and parts of modern day north-central [[Spain]].

Other definitions include [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], because Portuguese and Galician share close linguistic and cultural ties, [[Celt]] ties; having both derived from the ancient [[Portuguese-Galician]] and the term is cultural classification, rather than a Historic-Geographical definition. However, in the Roman times, the Gallaeci were not part of the [[Lusitania]] province.

Despite all this, the language was born in the old [[Gallaecia]] which comprise what is now [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] and the region where Portugal was born, north [[Portugal]].

The term is used like the ones used in other countries that were derived from the long-standing custom among many European countries to revive the Roman names of their country or the name of tribes who lived in it in Roman times, with establishing a "Roman Connection" being considered a way of gaining respectability and legitimacy. In the case of Portugal, use of the term "Lusitan" and its derivatives is attested, for example, in the first Portuguese dictionary  "Dictionarium ex Lusitanico in Latinum Sermonem" published in 1569  or the epic poem [[Os Lus<U+00ED>adas]] published in 1572 . A rival Roman-era term available to the Portuguese was [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]] - but since it referred to the entire peninsula it could be used, and was indeed used, also by the [[Spanish people|Spanish]].

Portuguese use of "Lusitania" is parallel to the use of [[Gallia]] in [[France]], [[Britannia]] in [[England]], [[Caledonia]] in [[Scotland]], [[Hibernia]] in [[Ireland]], [[Batavia]] in [[The Netherlands]], [[Helvetia]] in [[Switzerland]] and [[Germania]] in [[Germany]] (called "Deutschland" in its own inhabitants' languague). [[Belgium]] got its actual present name from the Roman [[Belgica]].

==Relation with Hispanic==

In the historical sense Hispanic is synonym of [[Iberic]], it refers only to the ancient people of the [[Iberian peninsula]]. In Portugal the term "hisp<U+00E2>nico" can be used in two contexts: It has a historical meaning when referring to the people of the Roman Hispania; the contemporary meaning is for Spain-related culture.

There has often been debate as to whether Lusitanics are [[Hispanic]]s, as historical arguments find that the region of [[Lusitania]] was a part of [[Hispania]] - and thus, "Lusitanics" are a subset of "[[Hispanic]]." The same way Spanish speaking [[South America]] was not a part of [[Hispania]] and the same argument can be applied: if Spanish Latin American people should be called Hispanic. [[Lusitania]] and the [[Lusitanians]] were known long before their conquest by the Roman Empire (Livy 218 b.c.) and incorporated in the Roman province of [[Hispania]] thus can not be considered a subset of "[[Hispanic]]." The contemporary meaning of "Hispanic" is much broader than the historical meaning: in the [[United States]] the term "[[Hispanic]]"  was first adopted by the administration of [[Richard Nixon]] and today is one of the several terms of ethnicity employed to categorize any person, of any racial background, of any country and of any religion who has at least one ancestor from the people of [[Spain]] or Spanish-speaking [[Latin America]], whether or not the person has [[Spanish people|Spanish]] ancestry, [[Lusitanics]] are not "[[Hispanic]]" for most ethnic categorization purposes, although it is highly debateable, and there are some exceptions - for instance, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has no official position as to wheter or not Lusitanic is Hispanic<ref>[http://www.eeoc.gov/foia/letters/2006/national_origin_classification.html Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's position on Lusitanic]</ref>, while the State of Florida classifies Portuguese as Hispanic<ref>[http://www.flsenate.gov/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&Search_String=&URL=Ch0288/Sec703.HTM Senate of Floridas position on Portuguese as Hispanic]</ref>.

== Lusitanic Americans ==
Using the above analogy with ''Hispanic'', then, one definition of ''Lusitanic'' would be anyone of any racial background with at least one parent from Portugal or from the ''Lusophonic'' (Portuguese speaking) area of Latin America.  Portuguese immigrants to the [[Americas]] and the inhabitants of the [[nation]] of [[Brazil]] or Brazilians living in [[Hispanic America]] or the [[United States]] would be ''Lusitanic Americans''.
