[[Massera's lemma]] is named after him.  He published over 40 papers during 1940<U+2013>1970. A militant [[Communist]], he was a political prisoner during 1975<U+2013>1984. In the 1930s, [[Rey Pastor]] gave regular weekend lectures on [[topology]] in [[Montevideo]] to a group that included Massera. Stimulated by contact with Argentine mathematics, the 1950s saw Uruguay develop a fine school in [[mathematics]], of which Massera was very much a part of.<ref name="Bethell1996">{{Citation | last = Bethell | first = Leslie | title = Ideas and Ideologies in Twentieth Century Latin America | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1996 | pages = 336 | isbn = 0521468337 | id = Bethell}}</ref>

Massera developed new notions of stability, and published several foundational papers and an influential textbook.  His results in {{harv|Massera|1950}} on periodic differential equations have been heavily cited<!-- over 50 in recent references, over 20 times in math reviews--> and are referred to as [[Massera's theorem]].  His work in {{harv|Massera|1949}} and {{harv|Massera|1956}} on the converse to [[Lyapunov stability|Lyapunov]]'s criterion is also influential, and contain the well known [[Massera's lemma]].  His textbook {{harv|Massera|Sch<U+00E4>ffer|1966}} is also heavily cited<!-- over 60 times in recent references, over 30 times in math reviews-->.

In 1971, at age 62<!-- date discrepancy-->, Massera was elected to the senate as an alternate senator.<ref name="Joyce1978">{{Citation | last = Joyce | first = James Avery | title = Human Rights: International Documents | publisher = Brill Archive | year = 1978 | pages = 1529 | isbn = 9028602984 | id =joyce}}</ref> After military intervention in Uruguay in 1973,<ref name="Bethell1996" /> Massera was arrested on October 22, 1975 in Montevideo and was held in [[solitary confinement]] for nearly a year. During this time he was subjected to repeated [[torture]] resulting in injuries including a [[fracture]]d [[pelvis]]. In October 1976 he was taken from solitary confinement, tried and convicted for "subversive association", and given a 24-year prison sentence.<ref name="Joyce1978" />  He was released in 1984.<ref>{{MR|0712764}}</ref>
