==Henry Rosenberg==

==Louis Amateis==

The base of the monument is {{convert|34|ft}} in diameter. The bulk of the monument consists of four columns made from a single block of granite. These are {{convert|50|ft}} high.

===Patriotism===

This column faces north to overlook the entrance to Galveston and, at the time, the entrance to the state of Texas. At the base of the column is a bronze relief of [[Sam Houston]] flanked by representations of peace and war. Underneath Houston are the reliefs of five men: [[Henry Smith (Texas Governor)|Henry Smith]], [[Edward Burleson]], [[Benjamin Milam]], [[James Fannin]] and [[James Bonham]].

===Courage===

This column faces east and contains the statue of a female unsheathing a sword and ordering the Mexicans out of Texas. She is known as Defiance, and underneath here is the date October 2, 1835, the day of the [[Goliad Massacre]] which is referenced by the bas relief of the massacre on the base of the monument.

===Honor===

At her feet are the names of heroes who did not have photos that could be authenticated:  Neill, Hockley, Karnes and de Zavalla. Below her is the date April 21, 1836, the Battle of San Jacinto. A bas relief underneath the date commemorates [[Antonio L<U+00F3>pez de Santa Anna|Santa Anna]]'s surrender to Sam Houston after the Battle of San Jacinto.
