==Plot==
{{endspoilers}}
The picture is set in the high plains of northwestern Argentina and portrays the life of a self-pitying Argentine [[bourgeois]] family.

The film tells the story of Mecha ([[Graciela Borges]]), a middle aged woman in her  50's who has several teenagers.  Her husband Gregorio (Martin Adejmian) wants to remain looking young.  Both have to deal with their gloomy [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Amerindian]] servants, who Mecha accuses of theft and laziness.

Both take to [[alcoholism|drinking]] to cope with day to day living. The family spends their summers in their rural shabby country home they name "La Mandragora" in order to avoid the hot and humid weather of the city.

Mecha's cousin, Tali ([[Mercedes Mor<U+00E1>n]]), lives in the nearby city of La Ci<U+00E9>naga (The Swamp, in English) and has a brood of small, yet, noisy children and a husband, Rafael (Daniel Valenzuela), who loves his family and also hunts.

Before long, the crowded domestic situation in both homes strains the families' nerves, exposing repressed family mysteries, and tensions that threaten to erupt into violence.

The film was first featured at the [[Berlin International Film Festival]] on [[February 8]], 2001.  It opened in Argentina on [[March 8]], 2001 at the [[Mar del Plata Film Festival]], and opened wide in Argentina on [[April 12]], 2001.

The film was also shown at various film festivals, including: the [[Karlovy Vary Film Festival]]; the [[Toronto Film Festival]]; the [[New York Film Festival]]; the Warsaw Film Festival; International Film Festival,  Rotterdam;  the Titanic International Filmpresence Festival, Hungary; the [[Adelaide International Film Festival]]; the Uruguay International Film Festival; and the [[Havana Film Festival]], Cuba.

In the [[United States]] it was presented at the [[New York Film Festival]] on [[October 2]], 2001.  It also opened in [[Los Angeles]] on [[October 12]], 2001.

==Critical reception==
The film was well received by film critics and was widely seen in many film festivals.  Writing for the ''[[New York Times]],'' critic Stephen Holden liked Lucrecia Martel's debut film, and called it "remarkable."  He said, "The steamy ambience in which the characters fester is a metaphor for creeping social decay...''La Ci<U+00E9>naga'' perspires from the screen, it creates a vision of social malaise that feels paradoxically familiar and new."<ref>[http://movies2.nytimes.com/gst/movies/movie.html?v_id=239383 Holden, Stephen]. ''New York Times,'' "Summertime, and the Living Is Approaching Unbearable,"  [[October 1]], 2001.</ref>

Critic David Lipfert also liked the director's various [[sociology|sociological]] messages and [[metaphor|metaphors]] contained in the film.  He believes the "New Argentina Cinema" is moving beyond the themes related to the military dictatorship period of the late [[1970s]] and early [[1980s]].  He said, "[Martel's] intense, in-your-face portrait of a dissolute middle class lacks the usual justifying criminal context. Martel simply holds up a mirror to Argentinean society, and the result is devastating. Instead of creating an allegory with archetypes, she shows characters that are all too real. When still, her camera is low and close as though we were right on top of the actors."<ref>[http://www.offoffoff.com/film/2001/cienaga.php3 Lipfert, David]. ''Offoffoff.com,'' film review, October 12, 2001.</ref> 

When the film opened in New York, film critic for the ''[[Village Voice]]'' Amy Taubin said, "Lucrecia Martel's ''La Ci<U+00E9>naga'' is a veritable [[Anton Chekhov|Chekhov]] tragicomedy of provincial life. Making a brilliant debut, Martel constructs her narrative from quotidian incidents, myriad comings and goings, and a cacophony of voices competing for attention...[i]n a debut feature that's assured in every aspect, Martel's direction of the younger members of her cast is particularly notable."<ref>Taubin, Amy.
