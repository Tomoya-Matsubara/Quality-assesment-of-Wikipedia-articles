The third Maccabiah, scheduled for 1938, was delayed until 1950 due to the rise of [[Nazism]] in Europe and the outbreak of the [[Second World War]]. The opening ceremonies took place on September 27, 1950, in the 50,000 seat stadium in [[Ramat Gan]].<ref>[http://maccabiusa.com/about-us/history/1950s.html]</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://israeled.org/third-maccabiah-games/ |title=Third Maccabiah Games |publisher=Today in Israeli History |archiveurl=http://israeled.org/third-maccabiah-games/ |archivedate=September 27, 2013 by Center for Israel Education}}</ref> The Maccabiah has been a quadrennial event since 1957.

==History==
[[Image:Maccabia1.jpg|thumb|First Maccabiah Games]]
Originally conceived by Yosef Yekutieli, a 15-year-old inspired by the [[1912 Summer Olympics|1912 Stockholm Olympic Games]],<ref name="Maccabi World Union">[http://www.maccabiworld.org/nconfigout.asp?psn=275&tcat=67 Maccabi World Union]</ref> the Games were first held in 1932 after 14 years of development by Yekutieli and the [[Jewish National Fund]]. During the planning stages, the games were nicknamed the ''Maccabiyon'', and 1932 was selected as the year to host the first games, marking the 1,800th anniversary of the [[Bar Kochba]] revolt.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trincoll.edu/~lkaplan/new_page_2.htm |title=The Maccabiah Games |publisher=Trincoll.edu |date=1932-03-28 |accessdate=2013-08-11}}</ref>

To generate interest in the games, and collect donations with which to build a stadium in [[Tel Aviv]] ([[Maccabiah Stadium]]), a group of representatives traveled by motorcycle on two separate routes, promoting the games to different communities.  The first was from [[British Mandate of Palestine|Palestine]] to [[Syria]], [[Turkey]], Poland, Germany, France, and Belgium.  The second from May 10 through July 16, 1931, went from Tel Aviv through the [[Sinai]] desert to [[Cairo]] and [[Alexandria]] in Egypt, and then proceeded by ship to [[Salonika]] in Greece, [[Bulgaria]], [[Yugoslavia]], [[Czechoslovakia]], Austria, Germany, and France, and by ferry to Brighton and the English cities of London, Birmingham, Manchester, and Leeds to Glasgow in Scotland, and home via Beirut in Lebanon.<ref name="Maccabi World Union"/>

The [[1932 Maccabiah Games]] were opened on March 28, 1932, and about 400 sportsmen took part. The games were held in athletics, football, and swimming. The second games, [[1935 Maccabiah Games]], was held in April 1935, and about 1,350 athletes competed.

The [[1997 Maccabiah Games]] were marred by a [[Maccabiah bridge collapse|Maccabiah Bridge Disaster]] when a temporary bridge built for the march of athletes at the opening ceremony collapsed, plunging about 100 members of the Australian delegation into the polluted waters of [[Yarkon River]]. Four athletes were killed and 63 injured.

The [[2005 Maccabiah Games]] attracted 900 representatives from the United States, 500 from Australia, and over 2,000 from Israel, bringing the total participants to more than 7,700. Israel finished at the top of the medal count with 227 gold medals.  The United States was a distant second with 71 gold medals, while Russia came in third with 15.

The [[2009 Maccabiah Games]] hosted athletes from 51 countries competing in 31 sports events.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ahren |first=Raphael |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1099877.html |title=2009 Maccabiah Games |publisher=Haaretz.com |date=2009-07-13 |accessdate=2013-08-11}}</ref>

The [[2013 Maccabiah Games]] were hosted in Jerusalem. The opening ceremony took place on July 18, 2013 at [[Teddy Stadium]].

The games, always held in Israel, are in fact three separate competitions <U+2013> "Open," "Juniors," and "Masters". Every Israeli citizen and every Jew not an Israeli citizen, is eligible to compete in the games.  Sports in the junior games are open to any qualifying athlete aged 15 to 18.  Masters' sports are divided into a number of different age categories<U+2014>generally for older competitors.

Unlike the Olympic games and other major international sporting events, the sport list for the Maccabiah Games is not set in stone.  The "Basic Rules" of the Maccabiah Games state that competitions will only take place if four (three, in the case of all female sports, and junior team sports) countries bring competitors for that sport.<ref>[http://www.maccabiah17.com/Images/Links/Basic%20Rules%20.pdf 17th Maccabiah Basic Regulations]{{dead link|date=August 2013}}</ref>
