'''Philip Michael Rivers''' (born December 8, 1981) is an [[American football]] [[quarterback]] for the [[San Diego Chargers]] of the [[National Football League]] (NFL). He was one half of the [[Manning-Rivers trade|Manning-Rivers draft trade]] which sent him to San Diego and the 1st overall pick, [[Ole Miss]] quarterback [[Eli Manning]], to the [[New York Giants]]. Rivers played [[college football]] at [[North Carolina State University]]. Rivers' career [[passer rating]] of 95.5 is fifth-best all-time among NFL quarterbacks with at least 1,500 passing attempts, behind [[Aaron Rodgers]], [[Tony Romo]], [[Steve Young]], and [[Tom Brady]].

After starting Chargers quarterback [[Drew Brees]] went to the [[New Orleans Saints]] following the 2005 season, Rivers came off the bench to lead the Chargers to a 14-2 record in his first season as a starter. In 2007, he helped the Chargers win their first playoff game since 1994 after beating the [[Tennessee Titans]] in the wildcard round of the 2007 playoffs and eventually leading them to the [[AFC Championship game]]. He has a career total of 13 fourth quarter comebacks, his most recent being on September 11, 2011, when he led the Chargers to a 24-17 win over the [[Minnesota Vikings]].<ref>[http://www.pro-football-reference.com/play-index/comeback.cgi?player=RivePh00 "Philip Rivers's Career 4th quarter comebacks and game-winning drives"] Pro-Football-Reference.com</ref>

==Early life==
Rivers was born in Decatur, Alabama, where his father Steve was the head coach of Decatur High. Philip went to Decatur then moved to Athens. As part of a fifth-grade project, he had to make a poster about his dreams and aspirations. On the poster, he pasted his face over that of a [[Minnesota Vikings]] player who had appeared on a cover of ''Sports Illustrated''.<ref>[http://www.jockbio.com/Bios/Rivers/Rivers_bio.html JockBio: Philip Rivers Biography<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> He has worn the number 17 since ninth grade; it is in honor of his father, who wore the same number in high school. After his dad, Steve, got the head coaching job, Philip played high school football at [[Athens High School (Alabama)|Athens High School]] in nearby [[Athens, Alabama]].

==College career==
After high school, Rivers attended North Carolina State University in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]], where he played for coach [[Chuck Amato]]. During his collegiate career, Rivers shattered almost every NC State and [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] passing record. His career culminated with an [[NCAA]] record 51st consecutive college start.<ref name="Philip Rivers on Brett Favre's streak: Unbelievable">[http://content.usatoday.com/communities/thehuddle/post/2010/12/philip-rivers-on-brett-favres-streak-unbelievable/1 Philip Rivers on Brett Favre's streak: Unbelievable]</ref> The Wolfpack went to four consecutive bowl games under the leadership of Rivers, winning three of them, including a New Year's Day victory over [[University of Notre Dame|Notre Dame]] in the 2003 [[Gator Bowl]].

As a senior, Rivers was named ACC Player of the Year<ref>"[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Coast_Conference_football_individual_awards#Player_of_the_Year]"</ref> for the 2003 football season and [[ACC Athlete of the Year]] for 2003-2004.  He was also named the game MVP of four bowl games, two [[Champs Sports Bowl|Tangerine Bowl]]s, a [[Gator Bowl]] and the 2004 [[Senior Bowl]]. Rivers was even named the "Offensive MVP" for NC State in a losing cause to [[Pittsburgh]] in 2001's [[Champs Sports Bowl|Tangerine Bowl]]. He was considered a Heisman candidate by some journalists,<ref>"[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=AT&p_theme=at&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0FDFF24744B1A485&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM GEORGIA TECH 29, N.C. STATE 21: CONTAINING RIVERS: Heisman hopeful battered in defeat,"] ''The Atlanta Journal-Constitution,'' October 5, 2003.</ref> but he was not invited to the [[Heisman Trophy]] presentation. Rivers finished his career with 13,484 passing yards, 4th all-time among Division 1-A quarterbacks (he was 2nd at the end of his collegiate career). He also threw 95 touchdown passes, which ties him for eighth all-time with [[Kliff Kingsbury]] and [[Brady Quinn]]. Rivers' number was retired before his final home game at North Carolina State.

==Professional career==

===2004 NFL Draft===
Rivers was projected to be an early first-round pick in the [[2004 NFL Draft]].  But despite Rivers' record of success in college and remarkable accuracy (72% completion percentage for his senior season), questions about his lack of arm strength and his unorthodox side-arm throwing motion were concerns for some [[NFL]] GMs. The pre-draft consensus was that Rivers could be selected by the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] with the 11th pick. The Chargers coveted [[Eli Manning]] and wanted to select him with their first round pick, which was also the first overall pick of the draft. However, after Eli Manning indicated before the draft that he would not sign with the [[San Diego Chargers]], the Chargers were forced to adjust their plans. Rivers was their first alternative to Manning because the Chargers head coach at the time, [[Marty Schottenheimer]], had coached Rivers at the [[Senior Bowl]] and he liked what he saw from Rivers. The Chargers agreed to a trade on draft day with the [[New York Giants]]. Manning was selected by the San Diego Chargers then later in the draft traded for Rivers, selected with the fourth pick by the Giants.  The Chargers also received draft picks from the Giants that were used to select future [[Pro Bowl]]ers [[Shawne Merriman]] and [[Nate Kaeding]].

===Quarterback class of 2004===
Rivers was one of four quarterbacks taken in the first round of the 2004 NFL Draft along with [[Ben Roethlisberger]], [[Eli Manning]], and [[J.P. Losman]].  Rivers, Roethlisberger, and Manning have been voted to the Pro Bowl since becoming starters, none have produced a season with a losing record until Rivers in 2012, but Roethlisberger and Manning both have won two Super Bowls.  They have been compared favorably to the [[Quarterback class of 1983]], which included Hall of Fame quarterbacks [[John Elway]] (1st pick), [[Jim Kelly]] (14th), and [[Dan Marino]] (27th).<ref>[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2009/writers/don_banks/08/28/qbs/index.html Best quarterback class ever? Trio from '04 makes its case over '83]</ref>

===San Diego Chargers===

====2004====
In August 2004, Rivers signed a six-year, $40.5 million contract with the [[San Diego Chargers]] that included $14.5 million in signing bonuses. However, due to a protracted contract negotiation with the San Diego Chargers, Rivers only reported to the team during the last week of training camp, and incumbent [[Drew Brees]] retained his starting job. Rivers began the season as the Chargers' third QB option, behind [[Doug Flutie]], and ahead of the No. 4 quarterback [[Cleo Lemon]]. Unfortunately for Rivers, Brees went on to have a then-career year and was named to the [[NFL Pro Bowl]] while winning the [[NFL Comeback Player of the Year Award]]. Rivers received very limited playing, playing in only two games. He only threw passes in the second half of the last game of the 2004 season (a win over Kansas City), by which time the Chargers had already clinched a home playoff spot and the AFC West division title.

====2005====
Rivers was promoted to the #2 on the quarterback depth chart after the Chargers released Doug Flutie, who later signed with the [[New England Patriots]].

Rivers was unable to beat out Brees for the starting quarterback job in the Chargers' 2005 training camp and preseason. In the Chargers' final game of the 2005 season, at home in [[Qualcomm Stadium]], Rivers entered the game after Brees dislocated his right shoulder late in the second quarter due to a hit from [[Denver Broncos]] safety [[John Lynch (American football)|John Lynch]]. Rivers completed 12 of 22 passing attempts for 115 yards with one interception and two fumbles. The Chargers lost to Denver, 20&ndash;7. However, Rivers led the Chargers on their only scoring drive that game, which culminated in a 4-yard TD run by RB [[LaDainian Tomlinson]].

====2006====
[[Image:Philip Rivers 2006-10-01.jpg|left|upright|thumb|Philip Rivers in 2006.]]
After the 2005 season, Brees was not re-signed (partly due to the injury suffered in the Denver game) by the Chargers, instead signing a large contract that included sizeable guaranteed money with the [[New Orleans Saints]] during the 2006 free agency period. Many doubted the Chargers' decision to change quarterbacks as they were a [[Super Bowl]] contender, believing that Rivers' inexperience would hinder them. Rivers was named the Chargers' starter going into training camp. Expectations were high for Rivers due to the large amount of talent on the San Diego Chargers' offense and the performance of his peers from the 2004 draft ([[Eli Manning]] and [[Ben Roethlisberger]]) as starters.

[[Football Outsiders]] projected that Rivers would become an NFL star before the 2006 season due to his spectacular [[completion percentage]] in college (72% as a senior). After just 5 NFL starts, Rivers was named the second best NFL quarterback under 25 years of age by [[Sports Illustrated]]<ref>[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/multimedia/photo_gallery/0610/gallery.nfl.top10youngQBs/content.9.html SI.com - Photo Gallery - Ranking Top 10 Young QBs: <br /> 25 and Under<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and had numerous comparisons to [[Dan Marino]] for his quick release and pocket presence.<ref>[http://www.statefansnation.com/index.php/archives/2006/09/28/focus-on-philip/ Focus on Philip at StateFans Nation<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

On September 11, 2006, Rivers made his NFL start against the Oakland Raiders. Rivers managed the game well despite only passing 11 times, but completed 8 passes, one for a touchdown, in a 27<U+2013>0 rout of the Raiders. After his first game, Rivers led the NFL in QB rating with 133.9.<ref>[http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/recap?game_id=28875&displayPage=tab_recap&season=2006&week=REG1 NFL Game Center: Game Recap - San Diego Chargers at Oakland Raiders - 2006 1<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

The fifth week of the season, the reigning [[Super Bowl]]-champion [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] came to town, and [[Bill Cowher]]'s defensive game plan revolved around stopping [[LaDainian Tomlinson]]. This game marked a turning point for Rivers, who aided by head coach [[Marty Schottenheimer]]'s opening of the playbook, led the team in a come-from-behind victory throwing 24-of-37 for 242 yards and two TDs, winning 23<U+2013>13.<ref>[http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/recap?game_id=28930&displayPage=tab_recap&season=2006&week=REG5 NFL Game Center: Game Recap - Pittsburgh Steelers at San Diego Chargers - 2006 5<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

On November 12, 2006, Rivers had the best game of his short career and led the San Diego Chargers to an improbable comeback against the Cincinnati Bengals. Down 28&ndash;7 at halftime, Rivers led the Chargers on six drives culminating in touchdowns. After driving in for the Chargers first touchdown after halftime, [[Nick Hardwick (American football)|Nick Hardwick]], Rivers' [[center (American football)|center]], reminisced about Rivers, mimicking his southern drawl, "He's yelling 'Y'all don't think we're out of this' to the Bengals. When he said that, I said, 'Shoot, I guess we ain't out of this. Right on.'"<ref>[http://www.sportingnews.com/yourturn/viewtopic.php?t=257188 SportingNews.com - Your expert source for NFL Football stats, scores, standings, blogs and fantasy news from NFL Football columnists<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Rivers threw for 337 yards and three touchdown passes, while LaDainian Tomlinson scored three of their four rushing touchdowns. San Diego outscored Cincinnati 42&ndash;13 in the second half winning the game 49&ndash;41, matching the biggest comeback in 23 years for the Chargers.<ref>[http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/recap?game_id=28990&displayPage=tab_recap&season=2006&week=REG10 NFL Game Center: Game Recap - San Diego Chargers at Cincinnati Bengals - 2006 10<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Then following week against what was considered at the time to be a strong Denver Broncos defense, the Chargers became the first team in history to win back-to-back games after trailing by 17 or more points and also the first team to win four straight when allowing at least 27 points in each game.<ref>[http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/recap?game_id=29018&displayPage=tab_recap&season=2006&week=REG11 NFL Game Center: Game Recap - San Diego Chargers at Denver Broncos - 2006 11<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Rivers led several 4th quarter comebacks in 2006, and posted the league's highest 4th quarter quarterback rating. His performance over the season led to a selection to the [[2007 Pro Bowl]]. After a 14&ndash;2 season the Chargers were set to play the [[New England Patriots]] in the divisional round of the playoffs. The Patriots won that game, and Schottenheimer lost his job.  The Patriots went on to the AFC Championship where they lost to the Indianapolis Colts 38-34.

====2007====
[[Norv Turner]] took over as the head coach of the Chargers in 2007.  After a 1&ndash;3 start, the Chargers found their groove, finishing 11&ndash;5 and winning the [[AFC West]] for the second straight year. The Chargers also won their first two playoff games since the 1994 season, beating the [[Tennessee Titans]] and the [[Indianapolis Colts]] before falling to the Patriots in the [[AFC Championship Game]] 21&ndash;12.
In the 2007 AFC Championship Game, Rivers' was lauded by his teammates and the press for playing the entire game with a torn [[anterior cruciate ligament]], which later required surgery and was ranked among the ''[[NFL Top 10|NFL Top 10 Gutsiest Performances]]''.<ref name=top_ten_gutsiest>{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/videos/nfl-network-top-ten/09000d5d810a58f8/Top-Ten-Gutsiest-Performances-Philip-Rivers |title=NFL Videos: Top Ten Gutsiest Performances: Philip Rivers |publisher=Nfl.com |date=2009-06-03 |accessdate=2011-09-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite news

Despite having good stats in 2008 Rivers was only able to lead his team to an 8-8 record and they were able to win the division over Denver by a tie-breaker. On January 3, 2009, the San Diego Chargers defeated the [[Indianapolis Colts]] 23<U+2013>17 to advance to the AFC Divisional Playoff.  Rivers led the Chargers down the field down 3 points with under 2 minutes left.  He set up Nate Kaeding for a game-tying field goal that would lead to overtime, where the Chargers would go on to win 23<U+2013>17, thanks to a Darren Sproles touchdown.
In the divisional round versus the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], Rivers played well throwing for over 300 yards and 3 touchdowns but was sacked 4 times and threw an interception.  Despite his efforts, the team fell short and lost to the Steelers 35<U+2013>24.  They possessed the ball for only 17 seconds during the third quarter and had only 15 yards rushing.

====2009====
[[File:LT Chargers.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Rivers handing off to [[Ladainian Tomlinson]], 2006.]]
On August 24, Rivers signed a 6-year,a $92 million dollar contract extension with the Chargers, with approximately $38 million guaranteed.<ref>{{cite web|title=Source: Rivers' extension worth $92M |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=4418854 |date=24 August 2009 |author=[[Len Pasquarelli]] |publisher=[[ESPN]] |accessdate=25 August 2009}}</ref>
Rivers was voted into his second career [[Pro Bowl]] on December 29. He ended the season with a passer rating of 104.4, the third highest in the entire [[NFL]], after passing for 4,254 yards, 28 TD's with only 9 interceptions. For the second consecutive year, he led the NFL in yards per attempt (8.8) and adjusted yards per attempt (9.1).<ref name=stuart/><ref name=pfr/> He led the Chargers to the second seed in the [[American Football Conference|AFC]] with a 13-3 record, tied for second best in the NFL.

The Chargers lost 17-14 to the [[New York Jets]], who moved on to play the [[Indianapolis Colts]] in the [[AFC Championship]], which they lost 30-17.

====2010====
Rivers led the league in passing yards, throwing for a career high 4,710 yards - 10 yards more than second-place finisher, [[Peyton Manning]].

====2011====
Entering the [[2011 San Diego Chargers season|2011 season]], Nick Canepa of the ''San Diego Union-Tribune'' called Rivers a "better quarterback" than Fouts, a first-ballot Hall of Fame quarterback. Canepa cited Rivers "[completing] passes to an astounding 17 different receivers" in 2010, amid the injuries to Chargers receivers, and his then 55<U+2013>25 record as a starter compared to 86<U+2013>84<U+2013>1 for Fouts.
