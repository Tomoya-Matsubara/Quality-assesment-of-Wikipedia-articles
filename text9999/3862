{{About|the biological cause of sexual differentiation||Sex determination (disambiguation)}}

A '''sex-determination system''' is a [[biology|biological]] system that determines the development of [[sex|sexual characteristics]] in an [[organism]]. Most sexual organisms have two [[gender|sexes]]. In many cases, sex determination is genetic: [[male]]s and [[female]]s have different [[allele]]s or even different [[gene]]s that specify their sexual [[Comparative anatomy|morphology]]. In [[animal]]s, this is often accompanied by [[chromosome|chromosomal]] differences. In other cases, sex is determined by [[ecosystem|environmental]] variables (such as [[Temperature-dependent sex determination|temperature]]) or social variables (the size of an organism relative to other members of its [[population]]). The details of some sex-determination systems are not yet fully understood.

==Origin of sex chromosomes==
The accepted hypothesis of XY and ZW sex chromosome evolution is that they evolved at the same time, in two different branches.<ref name=Namekawa>{{cite journal|author=Namekawa, Satoshi|title=XY and ZW: Is Meiotic Sex Chromosome Inactivation the Rule in Evolution?|publisher=Public Library of Science|year=2009|pages=3|volume=5|doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1000493|issue=5|accessdate=23 October 2011}}</ref><ref name="Vallender">{{cite journal|author=Vallender, Eric|title=Multiple independent origins of sex chromosomes in amniotes

All sex chromosomes started out as an original [[autosome]] of an ancestral reptile that relied upon temperature to determine the sex of offspring. After the mammals separated, the branch further split into [[Lepidosauria]] and [[Archosauromorpha]]. These two groups both evolved the ZW system separately, as evidenced by the existence of different sex chromosomal locations.<ref name="Vallender"/> In mammals, one of the autosome pair mutated its [[SOX3]] gene into the [[SRY]] gene.<ref name="Vallender"/><ref name=Easton>{{cite press release| title =The evolution of the sex chromosomes: Step by step | publisher=University of Chicago Medical Center|date=28 October 1999|url =http://www.uchospitals.edu/news/1999/19991028-x-vs-y.html|accessdate =23 October 2011}}</ref> After this mutation, the SRY-containing chromosome [[Chromosomal inversion|inverted]] and could no longer swap genes with its partner. The Y chromosome continued to receive mutations throughout the years, and without a partner to combine with, it slowly decayed.<ref name=Vallender/> However, because both the chromosomes were necessary for reproduction, the Y chromosome remained, despite its inability to pair with the X.

==Chromosomal determination==
=== XX/XY sex chromosomes ===
[[Image:Drosophila XY sex-determination.svg|thumb|Drosophila sex-chromosomes]]
{{Main|XY sex-determination system}}
The '''XX/XY sex-determination system''' is the most familiar, as it is found in [[human]]s. In the system, females have two of the same kind of sex chromosome (XX), while males have two distinct sex chromosomes (XY). The XY sex chromosomes are different in shape and size from each other, unlike the autosomes, and are termed [[allosome]]s. Some species (including humans) have a gene SRY on the Y chromosome that determines maleness; others (such as the [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit fly]]) use the presence of two X chromosomes to determine femaleness. In Y-centered sex determination, the SRY gene is not the only gene to have an influence on sex. In XY mice, lack of the gene [[DAX1]] on the X chromosome results in sterility, but in humans it causes [[adrenal  hypoplasia congenita]]. <ref name=Goodfellow>{{cite journal|author=Goodfellow, P.N.|title=DAX-1, an <U+2018>antitestis<U+2019>gene|journal=Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences|year=1999|pages=857-863|volume=55|doi=10.1007/PL00013201}}</ref> However, when an extra DAX1 gene is placed on the X, the result is a female, despite the existence of SRY. <ref name=Chandra>{{cite journal|author=Chandra, H.S.|title=Another way of looking at the enigma of sex determination in Ellobius lutescens|journal=Current Science|date=1999 April 25|pages1072-1072|volume=76|issue=8}}</ref>  

The XX/XY system is also found in most other [[mammal]]s, as well as some insects. However, at least one [[monotreme]], the [[platypus#Evolution|platypus]], presents a particular sex determination scheme that in some ways resembles that of the ZW sex chromosomes of birds, and also lacks the SRY gene, whereas some [[rodent]]s, such as several [[Arvicolinae]] (voles and lemmings), are also noted for their unusual sex determination systems. The platypus has ten sex chromosomes; males have an XYXYXYXYXY pattern while females have ten X chromosomes. Although it is an XY system, the platypus' sex chromosomes share no homologues with [[eutherian]] sex chromosomes.<ref name=Warren>{{cite journal|author=Warren, W.C.|title=Genome analysis of the platypus reveals unique signatures of evolution|journal=Nature|year=2008|pages=175<U+2013>U1|volume=453|doi=10.1038/nature06936|issue=7192|pmid=18464734|pmc=2803040|last2=Hillier|first2=Ladeana W.|last3=Marshall Graves|first3=Jennifer A.|last4=Birney|first4=Ewan| last5=Ponting|first5=Chris P.|last6=Gr<U+00FC>tzner|first6=Frank|last7=Belov|first7=Katherine|last8=Miller|first8=Webb|last9=Clarke|first9=Laura}}</ref> Instead, homologues with eutherian sex chromosomes lie on the platypus chromosome 6, which means that the eutherian sex chromosomes were autosomes at the time that the monotremes diverged from the therian mammals (marsupials and eutherian mammals). However, homologues to the avian DMRT1 gene on platypus sex chromosomes X3 and X5 suggest that it is possible the sex-determining gene for the platypus is the same one that is involved in bird sex-determination. However, more research must be conducted in order to determine the exact sex determining gene of the platypus.<ref name=Gruetzner>{{cite journal|author=Gruetzner, F., T. Ashley, D. M. Rowell, and J.

=== XX/X0 sex determination ===
{{Main|X0 sex-determination system}}
In this variant of the XY system, females have two copies of the sex chromosome (XX) but males have only one (X0).  The ''0'' denotes the absence of a second sex chromosome.  This system is observed in a number of [[insect]]s, including the grasshoppers and crickets of order [[Orthoptera]] and in cockroaches (order [[cockroach|Blattodea]]).

The [[nematode]] ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans|C. elegans]]'' is male with one sex chromosome (X0); with a pair of chromosomes (XX) it is a [[hermaphrodite]].<ref name="Majerus">{{Harv|Majerus|2003|page=60}}</ref>

A small number of mammals also lack a Y chromosome. These include the Amami spiny rat (''[[Tokudaia osimensis]]'') and the Tokunoshima spiny rat (''[[Tokudaia tokunoshimensis]]''). Voles also have a form of XO determination in which both genders lack a second sex chromosome. <ref name=Chandra/> The mechanism of sex determination is not yet understood.<ref name=Kuroiwa>{{cite journal|author=Kuroiwa A, Handa S, Nishiyama C, Chiba E, Yamada F, Abe S, Matsuda Y|title= Additional copies of CBX2 in the genomes of males of mammals lacking SRY, the Amami spiny rat (''Tokudaia osimensis'') and the Tokunoshima spiny rat (''Tokudaia tokunoshimensis'').|journal=Chromosome Res|year=2011|pages=|volume=|pmid=|issue=|doi=}}</ref>

=== ZW sex chromosomes ===
{{Main|ZW sex-determination system}}
The '''ZW sex-determination system''' is found in [[bird]]s, some insects and other organisms.  The ZW sex-determination system is reversed compared to the XY system: females have two different kinds of [[chromosomes]] (ZW), and males have two of the same kind of chromosomes (ZZ). In the chicken, this was found to be dependent on the expression of [[DMRT1]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Smith CA, Roeszler KN, Ohnesorg T, ''et al.'' |title=The avian Z-linked gene DMRT1 is required for male sex determination in the chicken|journal=Nature|volume=461|issue=7261|pages=267<U+2013>71|year=2009|month=September|pmid=19710650|doi=10.1038/nature08298|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v461/n7261/full/nature08298.html}}</ref> However, not all species depend upon the W for their gender. For example, there are moths and butterflies that are ZW, but some have been found female with ZO, as well as female with ZZW.<ref name="Majerus"/> Also, while mammals inactivate one of their extra X chromosomes when female, it appears that in the case of [[Lepidoptera]], the males produce double the normal amount of enzymes, due to having two Z's.<ref name="Majerus"/> Because the use of ZW sex determination is varied, it is still unknown how exactly most species determine their sex.<ref name="Majerus"/> Despite the similarities between ZW and XY, the sex chromosomes do not line up correctly and evolved separately. In the case of the chicken, their Z chromosome is more similar to humans' autosome 9.<ref name=Stiglec>{{cite journal |author=Stiglec R, Ezaz T, Graves JA |title=A new look at the evolution of avian sex chromosomes |journal=Cytogenet.

[[File:Haplodiploid-sex-determination-system3.png|thumb|left|Haplodiploid sex chromosomes]]

=== Haplodiploidy ===
{{Main|Ploidy|Haplodiploid sex-determination system}}
[[Ploidy#Haplodiploidy|Haplodiploidy]] is found in [[insects]] belonging to [[Hymenoptera]], such as [[ant]]s and [[bee]]s. Unfertilized eggs develop into [[haploid]] individuals, which are the males. [[Diploid]] individuals are generally female but may be sterile males. Thus, if a queen bee mates with one drone, her daughters share <U+00BE> of their genes with each other, not <U+00BD> as in the XY and ZW systems. This is believed to be significant for the development of [[eusociality]], as it increases the significance of [[kin selection]], but it is debated. <ref name=eowilson>{{cite journal| author = Edward O. Wilson| title = Kin selection as the key to altruism: its rise and fall.| journal = Social Research| volume = 72| pages = 1<U+2013>8| date = 2005-09-12| url = http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Kin+selection+as+the+key+to+altruism%3A+its+rise+and+fall.-a0132354420| format = PDF| accessdate = 2011-03-25}}</ref> Most females in the Hymenoptera order can decide the sex of their offspring by releasing sperm or not. This allows them to create more workers, depending on the status of the colony. <ref name=Wilgenburg>{{cite journal| author = Ellen van Wilgenburg| title = Single locus complementary sex determination in Hymenoptera: an "unintelligent" design?

==Non-genetic sex-determination systems==

{{See also|Temperature-dependent sex determination}}
Many other sex-determination systems exist. In some species of reptiles, including [[alligator]]s, some [[turtle]]s, and the [[tuatara]], sex is determined by the temperature at which the egg is incubated. Some species, such as some [[snail]]s, practice sex change: adults start out male, then become female. In tropical [[clown fish]], the dominant individual in a group becomes female while the other ones are male, and bluehead wrasses (''[[Thalassoma bifasciatum]]'') are the reverse. In the marine worm ''[[Bonellia viridis]]'', larvae become males if they make physical contact with a female, and females if they end up on the bare sea floor.

Some species, however, have no sex-determination system. [[Hermaphrodites]] include the common earthworm and certain species of snails. A few species of fish, reptiles, and insects reproduce by [[parthenogenesis]] and are female altogether.

In some [[arthropod]]s, sex is determined by infection, as when [[Bacteria]] of the genus ''[[Wolbachia]]'' alter their sexuality; some species consist entirely of ZZ individuals, with sex determined by the presence of ''Wolbachia''.

Other unusual systems (this section is still being researched):
* [[Swordtail fish]]
* The [[Chironomidae|Chironomus]] midge species
* The [[Platypus]] has 10 sex chromosomes<ref name=Warren/> but lacks the mammalian sex-determining gene SRY, meaning that the process of sex determination in the Platypus remains unknown.<ref name=Gruetzner/>
