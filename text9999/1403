==Youth==
Pariani, the son of Italian immigrant parents, grew up in a working class Italian neighborhood called The Hill in [[St. Louis, Missouri]].  The younger of two brothers, Pariani<U+2019>s childhood consisted primarily of school, working at a local laundromat and playing street sports.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=kHDnoybHqNAC&pg=PA12&lpg=PA12&dq=%22gino+pariani%22&source=web&ots=zTVmF2xol9&sig=Gkwh6UFaOrpx4MY8NGqNv0bATdc#PPA5,M1 ''The Game of Their Lives'']</ref>  Pariani<U+2019>s joined a local youth club when he was thirteen.

==Club career==
In 1943, Pariani joined Schumachers when he as fifteen.  That year, he won his first title, a St. Louis Municipal League championship, with Schumachers.  He then moved to Raftery<U+2019>s S.C. and remained with them through the 1946-1947 season.  That year he was voted the league MVP.  In 1947, Carrenti Cleaners came under new sponsorship.  The renamed team, now known as [[St. Louis Simpkins-Ford]], recruited Pariani.  He would experience considerable success with Simpkins, winning the 1948 and 1950 [[Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup|U.S. Open Cup]] championships.  He continued to play until 1963.  Some time during his career, he also played for Calcaterra and Wildcats A.C.  Pariani was a St. Louis all-star selection every year from 1946 through 1953.

==National and Olympic team==
His success at the club level led to Pariani<U+2019>s selection to the [[United States at the 1948 Summer Olympics|U.S. soccer team]] at the [[Football at the 1948 Summer Olympics|1948 Summer Olympics]].  The U.S. lost 9-0 to Italy in the first round of this single elimination tournament.  Pariani did not play in this loss.  

Pariani gained his first [[cap (sports)|caps]] with the [[United States men's national soccer team|U.S. national team]] in an 11-0 loss to [[Norway national football team|Norway]] on August 6, 1948.  His second cap came five days later in a loss to Northern Ireland.  He did not play again with the full national team until the [[1950 FIFA World Cup]].  The invitation into the team came unexpectedly and Pariani had scheduled his wedding during the finals.  With the support of both families, he and his fianc<U+00E9> moved up the day to allow him to play in Brazil.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/obituaries/story/0,,2127093,00.html Obituary]</ref>    When he left St. Louis for New York, he had been married for only three days.  He went on to score the lone U.S. goal in the team<U+2019>s first game of the finals, a 3-1 loss to [[Spain national football team|Spain]].  Four days later, he was a key part of the U.S. victory over [[England national football team|England]], maintaining good ball possession.  He also sent [[Frank Wallace (soccer)|Frank Wallace]] on a break towards the English goal, a break stopped by [[Alf Ramsey]]. The U.S. ultimately won the game, one of the greatest upsets of World Cup history.  Pariani<U+2019>s last cap came in a 5-2 loss to [[Chile national football team|Chile]] which put the U.S. out of the cup.<ref>[http://www.soccerhall.org/history/MNTAlltime_1916-1959.htm Soccer Hall of Fame game results]</ref>
