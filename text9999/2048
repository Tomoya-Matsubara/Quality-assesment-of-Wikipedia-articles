'''Stanley Joseph McCabe''' ([[16 July]], [[1910]], [[Grenfell, New South Wales|Grenfell]], [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]] - [[25 August]], [[1968]], [[Mosman, New South Wales|Mosman]], [[New South Wales]]) was an [[Australia]]n [[cricket]]er. McCabe played 39 [[Test cricket|Test matches]] for Australia from [[1930]] to [[1938]], and led a noted career as a short, stocky attacking right-handed [[batsman]], described by [[Wisden]] as "one of Australia's greatest and most enterprising batsmen". He was never dropped from the Australian Test team in his career<ref name="az">{{cite book | last = Cashman, Franks, Maxwell, Sainsbury, Stoddart, Weaver, Webster | year = 1997 | title = The A-Z of Australian cricketers|pages =197-198}}</ref> and was known for his footwork, mastery of [[fast bowling]] and the [[Batting_(cricket)#Types_of_batting_shots|hook shot]] against the [[Bodyline]] strategy.  He also regularly bowled [[fast bowling|medium-pace]] as a part-timer, using an [[off cutter]]. He was one of the [[Wisden Cricketers of the Year]] in [[1935]].<ref name ="cricinfo">{{cite web|first= Gideon| last = Haigh| authorlink = Gideon Haigh| url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/australia/content/player/6540.html |title= Players and Officials - Stan McCabe|accessdate=2007-01-12|publisher=[[Cricinfo]]}}</ref>

== Early years ==

The son of a local [[barber]], McCabe was one of four brothers, who grew up playing local cricket in his hometown. At the age of 14, McCabe won a scholarship to [[St. Joseph's College, Hunters Hill]] in [[Sydney]] due to his sporting ability, playing in the Senior First XI at 14 as an [[all-rounder]]. Aside from playing cricket, he was also full-back in the school's championship winning [[Rugby union]] team in [[1926]].<ref name="pollard">{{cite book | last = Pollard |first= Jack | year = 1969 | title = Cricket the Australian Way}}</ref> He returned to Grenfell at the end of the year, and was noticed by state and later Australian selector E. A. Dwyer, who led a team to play in the country town. Dwyer convinced McCabe's parents to allow their son to move to Sydney to further his cricket career. After appearing with the New South Wales Colts teams, he was selected to represent [[New South Wales cricket team|New South Wales]] in his first-class debut against [[Queensland Bulls|Queensland]] in the 1928-29 [[Sheffield Shield]] season. He made 60 and 34, but was later omitted when the Test players returned from international duty. He settled in Sydney permanently in 1929.<ref name="az"/>

== International debut ==

He was selected to tour England in 1930 under [[Bill Woodfull]]'s [[Australian cricket team]] and made his debut in the First Test at [[Trent Bridge]], [[Nottingham]]. He took match figures of 2/65 and in his first Test innings as a batsman, he hit the first ball he received for a boundary but was dismissed off the next ball,<ref name="pollard"/> before scoring 49 in the second innings.<ref>{{cite web| title = 1st Test: England vs Australia at Nottingham, Jun 13-17, 1930| url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/australia/engine/match/62580.html|publisher= [[Cricinfo]]|accessdate=2007-01-12}}</ref> He then collected 4/41 in the Fourth Test at [[Old Trafford]], and then scored his first half-century, 54 at [[The Oval]] in the Fifth. In all, he scored 210 runs at 35 and 8 wickets at 27.62,<ref name="az"/> and aggregated more than 1000 for the whole tour.<ref name ="cricinfo"/> Upon his return to Australia, he played all five Tests against the [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]] in 1930/31. He scored 90 in the First at [[Adelaide Oval]], but struggled thereafter, totalling 196 runs at 32.66. The following year, he scored centuries in all three [[Sheffield Shield]] innings, scoring 229[[not out|*]] [[Queensland Bulls|Queensland]] at [[Brisbane]] and 106 and 103* against [[Victorian Bushrangers|Victoria]] in [[Sydney]], yielding a season average of 438. He was unable to translate the success into the Test arena, scoring 201 at 33.50 but bowled well with nine wickets at 22.77 in five Tests against South Africa, the highlight being an all-round performance of 79 and 4/13 at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]].<ref name ="cricinfo"/><ref name ="testall">{{cite web| url=http://statserver.cricket.org/guru?sdb=player;playerid=558;class=testplayer;filter=basic;team=0;opposition=0;notopposition=0;season=0;homeaway=0;continent=0;country=0;notcountry=0;groundid=0;startdefault=1999-04-01;start=1999-04-01;enddefault=2006-08-19;end=2006-08-19;tourneyid=0;finals=0;daynight=0;toss=0;scheduledovers=0;scheduleddays=0;innings=0;result=0;followon=0;seriesresult=0;captain=0;keeper=0;dnp=0;recent=;viewtype=aro_list;runslow=;runshigh=;batposition=0;dismissal=0;bowposition=0;ballslow=;ballshigh=;bpof=0;overslow=;overshigh=;conclow=;conchigh=;wicketslow=;wicketshigh=;dismissalslow=;dismissalshigh=;caughtlow=;caughthigh=;caughttype=0;stumpedlow=;stumpedhigh=;csearch=;submit=1;.cgifields=viewtype|  title = Statsguru - SJ McCabe - Tests - Innings by innings list| publisher = [[Cricinfo]] |accessdate =2007-01-12}}</ref><ref name = "testsum">{{cite web| url=http://statserver.cricket.org/guru?sdb=player;playerid=558;class=testplayer;filter=basic;team=0;opposition=0;notopposition=0;season=0;homeaway=0;continent=0;country=0;notcountry=0;groundid=0;startdefault=1996-04-03;start=1996-04-03;enddefault=2006-08-19;end=2006-08-19;tourneyid=0;finals=0;daynight=0;toss=0;scheduledovers=0;scheduleddays=0;innings=0;result=0;followon=0;seriesresult=0;captain=0;keeper=0;dnp=0;recent=;viewtype=aro_series;runslow=;runshigh=;batposition=0;dismissal=0;bowposition=0;ballslow=;ballshigh=;bpof=0;overslow=;overshigh=;conclow=;conchigh=;wicketslow=;wicketshigh=;dismissalslow=;dismissalshigh=;caughtlow=;caughthigh=;caughttype=0;stumpedlow=;stumpedhigh=;csearch=;submit=1;.cgifields=viewtype |title = Statsguru - SJ McCabe - Tests - Series averages| publisher = [[Cricinfo]] |accessdate =2007-01-12}}</ref>

== Bodyline ==

McCabe made his breakthrough in the following Australian season in 1932-33, in the First Test in Sydney, with [[English cricket team|England]] lead by [[Douglas Jardine]] employing the [[Bodyline]] bowling theory. This involved constant intimidatory short-pitched leg-side bowling with a leg-cordon to catch balls fended off by the batsman, in an attempt to curtail [[Donald Bradman]], universally regarded as the best batsman ever, from scoring. Coming in at 3/82 on the first day, with [[Bill Woodfull]], [[Bill Ponsford]] and [[Jack Fingleton]] already dismissed, and Bradman ill, McCabe and [[Vic Richardson]] added 129 after [[Alan Kippax]] had fallen at 4/87, before reaching stumps at 127 not out with the total 6/290. McCabe's innings was marked by dangerous cutting and compulsive hooking of short-pitched deliveries in front of his face, unfazed by the repeated body blows which hit his team-mates. Having warned his parents, who were watching him in Test cricket for the only time, not to jump the fence should he be hit, McCabe's attack forced Jardine to abandon his Bodyline approach.<ref name="pollard"/> He scored 60 of the 70 runs the next day to finish 187* from 233 balls whilst batting with the tail, batting a little over four hours.<ref name="az"/> He was praised by [[Harold Larwood]], the English paceman who spearheaded the Bodyline approach with 10/128 after the match ended in a decisive 10-wicket victory for England.<ref name="pollard"/> He totalled 385 runs at 43 for the series and was the only Australian batsman other than Bradman to score a century, as the English decisively won the series 4-1.<ref name ="cricinfo"/>

Returning to England again in 1934, he scored eight centuries on the tour, more than any of his team-mates - including one innings of 240, the highest of his career, against [[Surrey cricket team|Surrey]] at [[The Oval]] and 137 in the Third Test at Old Trafford. He compiled three half-centuries to aggregate 483 runs at 60.37 and took four wickets. At the time, Wisden said of him: <U+201C>He blossomed forth as an almost completely equipped batsman of the forcing type and was probably the best exponent -- Bradman himself scarcely excluded -- of the art of hitting the ball tremendously hard and safely.<U+201D><ref name ="cricinfo"/>

== 1935-36 South African tour ==

The following Australian season he became captain of New South Wales and on the tour of [[South African cricket team|South Africa]] in 1935-36 he enjoyed more success, heading the Test batting figures with 420 runs, averaging 84.<ref name = "testsum"/> He hit 149 in the first Test at [[Durban]], sharing a second-wicket partnership of 161 with [[Bill Brown]] in gale-force conditions which forced the umpires to glue the bails to the wickets using chewing gum,<ref name="pollard"/> to set up a nine-wicket victory.<ref>{{cite web| title = 1st Test South Africa v Australia at Durban 14-18 Dec 1935|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1930S/1935-36/AUS_IN_RSA/AUS_RSA_T1_14-18DEC1935.html|publisher= [[Cricinfo]]|accessdate=2007-01-12}}</ref> At the following Test in [[Johannesburg]], Australia were set a record 399 in the second innings to achieve victory on a [[Spin bowling|turning]] wicket, and McCabe joined Fingleton at 1/17 to take the score to 1/85 by the end of the third day. The following morning in poor visibility, McCabe scored a century in the morning session, before Fingleton was dismissed at 2/194. McCabe pushed the score to 2/274, with only 125 needed with half the day remaining, Australia were on course to meet the target, having already scored 189 in the first half. However, [[Herbie Wade]], the South African captain made an unprecedented appeal against the light due fear <U+201C>for the fieldsmen's safety<U+201D> in the face of McCabe's aggressive batting.<ref name="az"/><ref>{{cite web| title = 2nd Test South Africa v Australia at Johannesburg 24-28 Dec 1935 |url=http://www.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1930S/1935-36/AUS_IN_RSA/AUS_RSA_T2_24-28DEC1935.html|publisher= [[Cricinfo]]|accessdate=2007-01-12}}</ref><ref name="pollard"/> He finished on 189*, an innings described by Fingleton as <U+201C>bordering on miraculous<U+201D>.<ref name ="cricinfo"/>
The following year, having been appointed Bradman's vice-captain, he had a successful Ashes series in 1936-37 in Australia, aggregating 491 runs in five Tests at 54.55, scoring 112 in the Fifth Test at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]], and five half-centuries in a consist display.<ref name = "testsum"/>
== International farewell ==

The [[Australian cricket team in England in 1938|1938 Ashes Tour]] of England was McCabe's last for Australia. McCabe's most highly-rated innings came in the First Test at Trent Bridge. England compiled  8/658 before declaring late on the second day. McCabe arrived at the crease with the dismissal of  Bradman at 2/111, and was 19 at the close of play with the total 3/138. The next morning he added 213 of the 273 runs scored, and was the last man out after a final wicket partnership with [[Leslie Fleetwood-Smith]] of 77, in which he scored 72. He finished with 232 in 235 minutes with 34 boundaries and one six, an innings in which Bradman summoned his players not to miss a ball, as <U+201C>they would never see anything like it again.<U+201D><ref name="az"/> Upon his return to the pavilion Bradman greeted him with the words: <U+201C>If I could play an innings like that, I'd be a proud man, Stan.<U+201D><ref name ="cricinfo"/> It was regarded by English captains [[Arthur Gilligan]] and [[Bob Wyatt]] to be the best innings that they had ever witnessed.<ref name="pollard"/> McCabe retired from Test matches at the end of the tour at just 28 years of age, due to chronic foot injuries. Curiously, none of his three most celebrated innings at Trent Bridge, Johannesburg nor Sydney resulted in an Australian victory.<ref name="az"/><ref>{{cite web| title = 1st Test Australia v England at Nottingham 10-14 Jun 1938|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1930S/1938/AUS_IN_ENG/AUS_ENG_T1_10-14JUN1938.html|publisher= [[Cricinfo]]|accessdate=2007-01-12}}</ref>

He continued to captain New South Wales for a further three seasons before retiring in 1941, aged just 31, with 24 wins and four losses in 38 matches as captain. He was briefly a member of the [[Australian Defence Forces]] during the [[Second World War]], but his feet problems resulted in an early discharge.<ref name="az"/> He served on the Trust of the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]] and operated a sports store in [[George Street, Sydney]]. Plagued by ill-health in his middle age, he died after falling from a cliff at his home in [[Mosman, New South Wales]].<ref name="az"/> He was inducted into the [[Australian Cricket Hall of Fame]] in [[2002]].<ref name="cricinfo"/>
