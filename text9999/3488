== Building ==
The current church was designed by [[architect]] [[James Gillespie Graham]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland|url=http://canmore.rcahms.gov.uk/en/site/141253/details/alloa+bedford+place+st+mungo+s+parish+church/}}</ref> The building, in [http://www.encyclo.co.uk/define/Droved droved ashlar], is one of his finest neo-perpendicular [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] hall [[Gothic architecture|kirks]].<ref name=BuildingsArchitectInterest>{{cite book|last=Owen|first=E.|title=Buildings of Architectural and Historical Interest in Clackmannan District|publisher=Planning Department, Clackmannan District Council|location=The Whins, Alloa|pages=10<U+2013>12}}</ref> It has a rectangular plan with low square towers at each angle and an advanced [[gable]] centred on the north front.<ref name=BuildingsArchitectInterest /> A spectacular 207&nbsp;ft (63m) [[crocket]]ed
[[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] [[St. James Church, Louth|louth-spire]] tops the building, so called because it was based on a fifteenth-century design at [[Louth, Lincolnshire]].<ref name=BuildingsArchitectInterest /> The spire is centred on the south front and dramatically supported by corner [[turrets]] and flying [[buttresses]].<ref name=BuildingsArchitectInterest /><ref name=AlloaAlmannac1887>{{cite book|last=Ephemerides|title=The Alloa illustrated family almanac, district directory and general register for the county of Clackmannan for 1887|year=1887|publisher=MacGregor and Steedman Journal Office|location=Alloa|pages=6|url=http://archive.org/details/alloaillustrated1887ephe}}</ref> The tower is furnished with a four-dial clock and a finely toned bell, weighing about fourteen [[Hundredweight|cwt]].<ref name=AlloaAlmannac1887 />

John Smith of Alloa was awarded the building contract.<ref name=BookRecon /> Robert Cock, along with his four sons, carried out the original [[slate]] work.<ref name=AlloaGeorgTimes /> The paint work was completed by Thomas Whitehead.<ref name=AlloaGeorgTimes /> Miller and Drysdale installed the plumbing.<ref name=AlloaGeorgTimes /> The imitation [[oak]] ceiling and ornaments around the ventilators were the first work carried out by John Wardhope from Edinburgh.<ref name=AlloaGeorgTimes /> The [[Earl of Mar]] erected at his own expense the ornamental railing around the church.<ref name=AlloaGeorgTimes /> It was intended that the railing on the north side should be circular, however, due to objections to its planned projection being too far into the centre of the road it was kept parallel to the road.<ref name=AlloaGeorgTimes />

The [[foundation stone]] was laid on 24 February 1817<ref name=AlloaEnvirons>{{cite book|last=Lothian|first=James|title=Alloa and its Environs: A Descriptive and Historical Sketch|year=1861|publisher=Alloa Advertiser Office|location=Alloa|pages=17}}</ref> and the church opened on 20 June 1819<ref name=AlloaEnvirons /><ref name=AlloaGeorgTimes /> with a capacity of 1561 seats.<ref name=ConciseHistAlloa /><ref name=NewStatScot /> There were 200 fewer seats than originally planned due to space taken up by the [[choir]] and [[Pipe organ|organ]].<ref name=BookRecon /> It is thought that around 2500 people attended the church opening<ref name=AlloaGeorgTimes /> which was more than half of the population of the town - at that time, the population of Alloa would only have been around 4000.<ref name=NewStatScot /> The first child to be [[baptise]]d after opening was John Francis Erskine, son of Mr. Robert Hutton.<ref name=AlloaEnvirons /><ref name=AlloaGeorgTimes /> To commemorate the occasion, the [[Earl of Mar]] presented Mr. Hutton with a silver cup bearing an inscription.<ref name=AlloaEnvirons /> It was 1825 before the bell and clock were added.<ref name=AlloaGeorgTimes>{{cite book|last=Whitehead|first=James|title=Alloa in Georgian Times|year=1992 reprint of articles from 1858/59|publisher=Clackmannan District Libraries|location=Alloa|pages=36<U+2013>38}}</ref> In the late 1830s, records show that the church had 2698 members from 766 families.<ref name=NewStatScot />

The total cost of the building came to <U+00A3>7000.<ref name=NewStatScot /><ref name=AlloaGeorgTimes /> [http://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/yourpaintings/paintings/lady-charlotte-erskine-195706 Lady Charlotte Erskine] bequeathed <U+00A3>1200 towards the cost<ref name=NewStatScot>{{cite book|last=Ministers of the Respective Parishes|title=The New Statistical Account of Scotland, Volume VIII, Dunbarton-Stirling-Clackmannan|year=1834-45|publisher=William Blackwood and Sons|location=Edinburgh and London|pages=44<U+2013>59, Clackmannashire}}</ref><ref name=AlloaGeorgTimes /><ref name=LothianRegister>{{cite book|last=Lothian|first=James|title=Lothian's Annual Register, County of Clackmannan|year=1877|publisher=James Lothian|location=Candle Street, Alloa|pages=17|url=http://archive.org/details/lothiansannualre1877allo}}</ref> and the spire was built by public subscription.<ref name=BookRecon /><ref name=AlloaGeorgTimes /> Lady Erskine's mortification deed specified that the sum should go towards an addition to the church of Alloa, keeping the new addition in good repair and provision of 246 seats.<ref name=NewStatScot /><ref name=LothianRegister /> Sixty seats were reserved for [[paupers]] who could not afford to pay and the remainder were to be let at a moderate yearly rent.<ref name=NewStatScot /> The cost of the new building was kept down by re-employing much of the stonework of the old church, leaving its western gable and bell-tower to stand alone.<ref name=BuildingsArchitectInterest />

Only two years after opening for worship, [[dry rot]] was already spreading rapidly throughout the interior of the church.<ref name=BookRecon /> The architect recommended that the space under the seats be filled with gravel and broken stone as well as paving the whole of the ground floor.<ref name=BookRecon />  This was carried out in 1824 except in the middle section of the church which was not infected.<ref name=BookRecon /> Further expensive schemes of interior improvement were carried out in 1895 and 1923 with little success since they left the existing interior largely unaltered.<ref name=BookRecon /> The church was noted as "lacking few pretensions to beauty".<ref name=AlloaAdvertiser>{{cite news|title=Alloa Church Rededicated|newspaper=The Alloa Advertiser|date=23 October 1937}}</ref>

In 1931, a legacy of <U+00A3>1000 was bequeathed to the church and, in recognition of the need for more modern and comfortable seating, the [[Kirk Session]] decided upon major reconstruction of the church interior.<ref name=BookRecon />  It was 1934 before the Session instructed architect [http://www.scottisharchitects.org.uk/architect_full.php?id=200832 Leslie Grahame Thomson MacDougall] to prepare plans for the reconstruction, which were duly presented to the congregation at an estimated cost of around <U+00A3>13,000 and subsequently approved.<ref name=BookRecon /><ref name=AlloaAdvertiser /> The Baird Trustees generously promised <U+00A3>1200 towards the cost and a Church Interior Reconstruction Fund was established.<ref name=BookRecon /><ref name=AlloaAdvertiser /> Lady collectors visited homes month by month to collect money for the fund.<ref name=AlloaAdvertiser /> Within two years, sufficient funds were raised from the monthly collections to allow the work to begin on 6 December 1936 and the church reopened on 16 October 1937.<ref name=BookRecon />

During the first phase of the reconstruction, the galleries were removed and the interior of the church was significantly brightened.<ref name=BookRecon /><ref name=AlloaAdvertiser /> A new entrance porch took the place of the old [[vestibule (architecture)|vestibule]] and allowed additional seating.<ref name=BookRecon /><ref name=AlloaAdvertiser /> The roof was found to be in serious disrepair and was entirely reconditioned with the plaster ceiling replaced by a panelled and embossed wooden design.<ref name=BookRecon /><ref name=AlloaAdvertiser /> The floor was also replaced and a new heating system installed along with pendant lanterns.<ref name=BookRecon /><ref name=AlloaAdvertiser /> Records show that a new pulpit, font and lectern were also gifted and installed during this first phase of the reconstruction.<ref name=BookRecon /><ref name=DSAStMungos>{{cite web|title=DSA Building/Design Report, St. Mungo's Parish Church Alloa|url=http://www.scottisharchitects.org.uk/building_full.php?id=210703|publisher=Dictionary of Scottish Architects|accessdate=17 January 2013}}</ref> At the same time, a Minister's chair and an acousticon earphone installation were also gifted.<ref name=BookRecon /><ref name=AlloaAdvertiser /> A second phase of reconstruction was planned which was to include a new [[chancel]], [[Vestry|vestries]] and [[session house]].<ref name=BookRecon />
However, it was not until 1967 that the alterations to the chancel and other improvements, including the addition of a choir room and session house, were undertaken to the same architect<U+2019>s plans.<ref name=DSAStMungos />

The current church has several [[stained glass window]]s that were installed as [[memorials]].  The Good Shepherd window (1896) is dedicated to William Duncan Bruce and his wife.<ref name=StMungosChurch>{{cite web|title=St. Mungo's Parish Church, About Us|url=http://www.stmungosparish.org.uk/aboutus.html|publisher=St. Mungo's Parish Church|accessdate=17 January 2013}}</ref> The Tie Deum window (1901) is dedicated to [http://histfam.familysearch.org/getperson.php?personID=I33067&tree=Fasti Alexander Bryson], former minister of the church (1870 - 1900) and the Gethsemane window (1910) is dedicated to the wife of James Brown. In 1991, a memorial window (Fisher of Men) was installed and dedicated to Peter Phillip Brodie, former minister of the church (1947 - 1986) and [[Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland]] (1978 <U+2013> 1979).<ref name=StMungosChurch /><ref name=WikiModChScot />

In 1972, the church was designated as a [[Listed building|Category B listed building]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Historic Scotland Listed Buildings Database (Ref 20997)|url=http://data.historic-scotland.gov.uk/pls/htmldb/f?p=2200:15:0::::BUILDING:20997}}</ref>
