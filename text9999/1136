'''Eugene Wason''' (26 January 1846 <U+2013> 19 April 1927) was a Scottish lawyer and [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] politician who sat in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] in three periods between 1885 and 1918.

==Family==

Eugene Wason came from a Liberal family. His father, brother and son-in-law, were all Liberal [[Members of Parliament]]. His father was [[Rigby Wason]] sometime MP for [[Ipswich (UK Parliament constituency)|Ipswich]],<ref>The Times, 6 December 1910</ref> his brother was [[Cathcart Wason]] the MP for [[Orkney and Shetland (UK Parliament constituency)|Orkney and Shetland]] from 1900<U+2013>1921 (and previously an MP in New Zealand 1876-79), first elected as a [[Liberal Unionist Party|Liberal Unionist]] but later switching to the Liberals<ref>The Times, 3 March 1954</ref> and his daughter Minna married [[John William Crombie]] who was MP for [[Kincardineshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Kincardineshire]] from 1892-1908.<ref>''Who was Who'', OUP 2007</ref> In 1870, Wason married Eleanor Mary from [[Dolgellau|Dolgelly]], the daughter of C. R. Williams, [[Deputy Lieutenant]] of [[Merionethshire]]. They had three sons and two daughters.<ref>''Who was Who'', OUP 2007</ref>

==Stature and character==
Wason, like his brother Cathcart, was well over 6 feet tall.<ref>The Times, 20 April 1927</ref> He was described by one of the contemporary [[Speaker of the House of Commons (UK)|Speakers of the House of Commons]] as <U+2018>the largest and tallest man in the House.<U+2019><ref>James William Lowther Ullswater, ''A Speaker's Commentaries''; Edward Arnold, 1925 p97</ref> [[Sir Percy Harris, 1st Baronet|Sir Percy Harris]] who was Liberal MP for [[Bethnal Green South West (UK Parliament constituency)|Bethnal Green South West]] and whose father was a close friend of Wason<U+2019>s has recorded that Eugene and Cathcart were giants, Eugene being thick set and heavy while Cathcart was willowy and thin. Harris related that the story always told about Eugene was that if he stepped on a weighing machine the hands would go on until they could no farther as he topped the maximum 20 stone mark on the dial. Not surprisingly, according to Harris, Eugene was fond of his food and wine,<ref>Percy Harris, ''Forty Years In and Out of Parliament''; Andrew Melrose, 1949</ref>) although he was also a keen sportsman listing his recreations in [[Who's Who (UK)|Who<U+2019>s Who]] in his younger days as football, shooting, rowing, and fishing although in later life these pursuits turned into reading, bridge, backgammon, and the card game picquet.<ref>''Who was Who'', OUP 2007</ref>

==Education==
Wason was educated first privately in France at [[Boulogne-sur-Mer]], then at [[Rock Ferry]] in [[Cheshire]] before going to [[Rugby School]].<ref>The Times, 21 December 1899</ref> While at Rugby, Wason served in the School Rifle Corps, achieving the rank of Lieutenant. He later became a member of the [[Volunteer Force (Great Britain)|8th Ayrshire Rifle Volunteers]].<ref>''Who was Who'', OUP 2007</ref> After Rugby, Wason went to [[Wadham College, Oxford]] where he gained a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA degree]] in 1868 and an [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|MA]] in 1870.  While he was a student at Oxford, Wason rowed in Trial Eights in 1865 and 1866 and was Captain of [[Wadham College Boat Club]]. He was also winner of the University [[Foil (fencing)|foils]] for 1868.<ref>''Who was Who'', OUP 2007</ref>

==Career==
Wason<U+2019>s chosen professions were the law and politics. He was [[called to the Bar]] by the [[Middle Temple]] in 1870 and practised on the Northern Circuit. Whether he did not at first take to being a [[barrister]] or perhaps just to gain greater legal experience, in 1872 Wason was disbarred as a barrister at his own request  in order to become a [[solicitor]].<ref>The Times, 20.4.27</ref> He was admitted as a solicitor in 1876, becoming a partner in Williams, James & Wason until 1885. Again at his own request, Wason was struck off the Rolls in 1886, ceasing to be a solicitor, in order to gain readmission as a member of the Bar the following week. This was deemed a unique experience, Wason having been both disbarred and struck off the Rolls, but each time at his own request. From 1878-1882, Wason served as Assistant Examiner to the Incorporated Law Society in Common Law.<ref>''Who was Who'', OUP 2007</ref>

==Politics==

===MP for South Ayrshire===
Wason was first elected to Parliament at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1885|1885 general election]] for the constituency of [[South Ayrshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Ayrshire South]]. This was his local seat as his home was at Blair, [[Dailly]], a village in the county. He held the seat only until the [[United Kingdom general election, 1886|1886 election]] when he lost to a [[Liberal Unionist Party|Liberal Unionist]]  but regained it at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1892|1892 general election]] and then served as its MP until [[United Kingdom general election, 1895|1895]] when he again forfeited the seat to a Liberal Unionist, Sir [[William Arrol]].<ref>The Times, 29 July 1895</ref>

===MP for Clackmannanshire and Kinross-shire===
Wason returned to Parliament in December 1899. The sitting Liberal MP for [[Clackmannanshire and Kinross-shire (UK Parliament constituency)|Clackmannan and Kinross]], [[John Balfour, 1st Baron Kinross|J B Balfour]] became a judge and resigned his seat. Wason was selected as Liberal candidate and fighting the [[Clackmannanshire and Kinross-shire by-election, 1899|by-election]] against the background of the [[Boer Wars|war in South Africa]] he managed to hold the seat, beating his [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] opponent [[George Younger, 1st Viscount Younger of Leckie|George Younger]]<ref>The Times, 21 December 1899</ref> albeit by a marginally reduced majority of 516 - down from 545 at the previous general election.<ref>The Times, 30 December 1899</ref>
 
After his by-election victory, Wason retained his Clackmannan and Kinross seat at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1900|1900 general election]] in a straight fight with the Conservatives by a majority of 351. In the Liberal landslide election of [[United Kingdom general election, 1906|1906]] he increased his majority over the Conservatives to 1,379 and in [[United Kingdom general election, January 1910|January 1910]] he maintained his advantage by a majority of 1,268. In [[United Kingdom general election, December 1910|December 1910]] he was returned unopposed.<ref>''The Times House of Commons 1911''; Politico<U+2019>s Publishing 2004 p109</ref> By 1918 Wason was 72 years old and decided to retire from Parliament at the next election.<ref>The Times, 24 April 1918</ref> He therefore stood down from Parliament at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1918|1918 election]].<ref>The Times, 21 November 1918</ref>

===Scottish MP===
Wason became a veteran MP, serving nearly 25 years in all. He was Chairman of the Scottish Liberal members for ten years from 1908-1918<ref>''Who was Who'', OUP 2007</ref> and was always a keen supporter of Scottish interests. He spoke in Parliament in favour of [[Home Rule]] for Scotland.<ref>The Times, 19 July 1910</ref> He presided at the meeting of Scottish Liberal members at the House of Commons which urged the government to implement the motion passed at the Scottish National Liberal Council at Dunfermline on 22 October  1910 which called for Home Rule to enable Scottish reforms to be carried through, adapted to the traditions, circumstances and aspirations of the Scottish people.<ref>The Times, 19 November 1910</ref> He served as Honorary President of the Scottish Chamber of Agriculture<ref>The Times, 2 September 1910</ref> and later led a deputation of Scottish Liberal MPs to [[prime minister]] [[H H Asquith]] in his room at the House of Commons on 25 April 1912 urging the introduction of a Bill for Scottish self-government in the next Session.<ref>The Times, 7 May 1912</ref> According to another source the delegation saw the prime minister again on 6 May 1912 and, while agreeing there was no groundswell of opinion in Scotland for home rule, there was <U+2018>concern and disgruntlement at the general neglect of Scottish affairs<U+2019> and they told Asquith they were worried this might escalate if not dealt with through an element of devolution.<ref>John Edward Kendle, ''Ireland and the Federal Solution: The Debate Over the United Kingdom Constitution, 1870-1921''; McGill-Queen's University Press, 1989 p149</ref>

===Radical MP?===
In the obituary of Wason written for [[The Times]] newspaper, he was described as a political [[Political radicalism|Radical]].<ref>The Times, 20 April 1927</ref> He was said to be a frequent speaker in the House of Commons (unlike his brother Cathcart) and usually gave expression to advanced radical views. On one important radical issue of the day, women<U+2019>s suffrage, he himself claimed to have always voted in favour.<ref>Homer Morris, ''Parliamentary Franchise Reform in England from 1885 to 1918''; Columbia University, 1921 p81</ref> His support of Home Rule all Round was also indicative of radical sentiments. However after he left Parliament, in the days when the old Liberal tradition was collapsing under the strains and stresses of party splits, the confusion of the electorate as to Liberal policy and the massive expansion of the electorate as a result of the [[Representation of the People Act 1918]],<ref>York Membery, ''The Liberals<U+2019> Last Hurrah''; History Today, December 2008, Volume 58, Issue 12, pp8-9</ref> Wason<U+2019>s radicalism was tested. At the general elections of [[United Kingdom general election, 1923|1923]] and [[United Kingdom general election, 1924|1924]] in Wason<U+2019>s home area of South Ayrshire no Liberal candidate could be persuaded to stand, leaving a straight fight between [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] and Conservative parties.<ref>F W S Craig, ''British Parliamentary Election Results, 1918-1949''; Political Reference Publications, 1969 p617</ref>
Faced with this choice at a time of polarisation in British politics, with Liberalism at a low ebb in Ayrshire<ref>The Times, 1 December 1923</ref> Wason supported the Conservative.<ref>The Times, 29 October 1924</ref>

===Other political and public offices===
In July 1902, Wason was appointed to be a member of the important [[Select Committee (Westminster System)|Select Committee]] on National Expenditure. Other members appointed at that time included [[Winston Churchill]], [[Bonar Law|Andrew Bonar Law]] and [[Austen Chamberlain]].<ref>The Times, 7 July 1902</ref>

In 1907, Wason was created a [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|Privy Councillor]] after which he was able to be termed [[The Right Honourable]] and was eligible to receive sensitive government information on highly confidential terms.<ref>The Times, 28 June 1907</ref>
 
In June 1915 he was appointed by the then Secretary for Scotland [[Thomas McKinnon Wood]] as Chairman of a Committee on Food Production in Scotland (under the auspices of the Board of Agriculture for Scotland) to make recommendations about maintaining and increasing food production on the assumption the war would last beyond the harvest of 1916.<ref>The Times, 24 June 1915</ref> He also served as a member of the Committee on the [[Scottish National War Memorial]].<ref>http://www.snwm.org/website/frames.html</ref> In 1917 he was made a [[Deputy Lieutenant]] for the County of [[Ayrshire]]<ref>The Times, 14 April 1917</ref> and was for some years a [[Justice of the Peace]] in Ayrshire.<ref>''Who was Who'', OUP 2007</ref>

==Travel==
Wason enjoyed foreign travel throughout his life and twice went round the world; in 1886<U+2013>87 by India, China, Japan, San Francisco, and America, and in 1896<U+2013>97 by Australia, New Zealand, Fiji, Hawaii, Vancouver, and Canada.<ref>''Who was Who'', OUP 2007</ref> His overseas vacationing landed him in serious difficulty at the outbreak of the First World War. In the Summer of 1914, Wason was on holiday in the Spa resort of Marienbad (now called [[Marianske Lazne]]) in what was then the [[Austro-Hungarian]] Imperial province of  [[Bohemia]] (now the Czech Republic). He was detained there as an [[enemy alien]] until September when he was allowed to travel to neutral Switzerland along with 200 other British subjects who had been taking the waters there and at the other nearby Spa town of Karlsbad (now called [[Karlovy Vary]]). He arrived in Geneva on 4 September and from there returned to England.<ref>The Times, 6 Sept 1914</ref>

==Burns Night, 1918==
Wason attended a [[Burns Night]] dinner in honour of the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Nations]] at the Criterion Restaurant in London on 25 January 1918 as one of the guests of the London Robert Burns Club. Unfortunately however the guests had to do without the traditional dish of [[haggis]]. The haggis had been ordered but owing to the food restrictions in Scotland caused by the war, the necessary ingredients were not available. This was ironical in view of Wason<U+2019>s previous role as Chairman of the Committee on Food Production in Scotland. The guests had to make do with what [[The Times]] newspaper report of the event described as <U+2018>an Italian dish<U+2019> (otherwise unspecified) but which was properly piped in by the bagpipes.<ref>The Times, 26 January 1918</ref>

==Death==
Wason died at his London home in Sussex Gardens, [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] on 20 April 1927 aged 81 years.<ref>The Times, 20 April 1927</ref>
