"'''Sardines'''" is the first episode of [[British dark comedy]] [[anthology series]] ''[[Inside No. 9]]''. Written by [[Steve Pemberton]] and [[Reece Shearsmith]], it premiered on [[BBC Two]] and [[BBC Two HD]] on 5 February 2014. The episode features a stand-alone plot revolving around a group of adults, who are non-recurring characters, playing [[sardines (game)|sardines]] at an [[engagement party]]. Rebecca, the bride-to-be, finds a boring man named Ian in a wardrobe; he introduces himself as a colleague of Jeremy, Rebecca's fianc<U+00E9>. The pair are subsequently joined by family, friends and colleagues of Rebecca and Jeremy. As more people enter the room and step into the wardrobe, secrets shared by some of the characters are revealed, with various allusions to incestuous relationships, child sexual abuse and adultery. The humour is both [[dark comedy|dark]] and [[British comedy|British]], with references to past unhappiness and polite but [[awkwardness|awkward]] interactions.

The story takes place entirely in the bedroom of a [[English country house|country house]], with much of the filming taking place inside the wardrobe. Pemberton and Shearsmith wrote the episode with the intention of evoking a feeling of [[claustrophobia]] in viewers. In addition to the writers, the episode starred [[Katherine Parkinson]], [[Tim Key]], [[Luke Pasqualino]], [[Ophelia Lovibond]], [[Anne Reid]], [[Julian Rhind-Tutt]], [[Anna Chancellor]], [[Marc Wootton]], [[Ben Willbond]] and [[Timothy West]]. The cast and writing were praised by television critics, and the episode was chosen as pick of the day in a number of publications. On its first showing, "Sardines" was watched by 1.1 million viewers, which was 5.6% of the audience.

==Development and production==
[[File:Reece Shearsmith.jpg|thumb|left|[[Reece Shearsmith]] ''(pictured in 2003)'' co-wrote "Sardines" and starred as the flamboyant Stuart]]
Writers [[Steve Pemberton]] and [[Reece Shearsmith]], who had previously worked together on ''[[The League of Gentlemen]]'' and ''[[Psychoville]]'', took inspiration for ''Inside No. 9'' from "David and Maureen", episode 4 of the first series of ''Psychoville'', which was in turn inspired by [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Rope (film)|Rope]]''. "David and Maureen" took place entirely in a single room, and it was filmed in only two shots.<ref name="Independent">{{cite news|title= Inside No 9, TV review: A top-drawer cast puts these twisted tales in a league of their own|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/reviews/inside-no-9-tv-review-a-topdrawer-cast-puts-these-twisted-tales-in-a-league-of-their-own-9110196.html|author= Dean, Will|date= 5 February 2014|accessdate= 6 February 2014|newspaper= [[The Independent]]}}</ref> The writers were keen to explore other stories in this [[bottle episode]] or [[TV play]] format, and ''Inside No. 9'' allowed them to do this.<ref name="PSII" /> At the same time, the concept of ''Inside No. 9'' was a "reaction" to ''Psychoville'', with Shearsmith saying that "We'd been so involved with labyrinthine over-arcing, we thought it would be nice to do six different stories with a complete new house of people each week. That's appealing, because as a viewer you might not like this story, but you've got a different one next week."<ref name="Broadcast">{{cite news|title=Inside No. 9, BBC2|url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/in-depth/inside-no-9-bbc2/5059391.article|newspaper= [[Broadcast (magazine)|Broadcast]]|date= 22 August 2013|accessdate= 6 February 2014}} {{subscription needed}}</ref>

Pemberton described the concept of "Sardines" as "a simple idea", and he was happy that the pair did not "have to worry about the consequences of it", due to the format of the series.<ref>{{cite web|title= Inside No. 9: interview with Reece Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2014/reece-steve-inn-interview.html|publisher= BBC|date= 30 January 2014|accessdate=6 February 2014}}</ref> The writers were inspired by a large wardrobe in their workspace. They had already written several other episodes for the series, and confinement was a recurring theme; the possibility of putting characters into a wardrobe gave them the opportunity to develop the theme to a more extreme level. The story was not initially about the game of sardines.<ref name="Inside">{{cite web|title= Inside the wardrobe|publisher=BBC|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01rty04|date= 6 February 2014|accessdate= 25 April 2014}}</ref> Pemberton said that the writers "talked about various ideas of why [the characters] were in a wardrobe", but that the pair "were certainly not working out [their] Freudian psychobabble".<ref>{{cite news|title= New Interview: Reece Shearsmith & Steve Pemberton|url= http://www.beyondthejoke.co.uk/content/new-interview-reece-shearsmith-steve-pemberton|date= February 2014|author= [[Bruce Dessau|Dessau, Bruce]]|publisher= Beyondthejoke.co.uk|accessdate= 20 February 2014}}</ref> A list of characters was written before the script, and the script included the introduction of a new character every three pages.<ref name="Hull" />

"Sardines" was written so that a feeling of [[claustrophobia]] would develop as the story progressed; Pemberton said that "our first consideration was, 'Can we get 12 people in a wardrobe?' So when we did the script read-through, the designer bought a wardrobe off eBay and we checked whether we could all get in it and shut the door".<ref name="Hull" /> Writers for ''[[Broadcast (magazine)|Broadcast]]'' described seeing the assortment of actors "crammed inside an imposing wardrobe" during filming as "an arresting spectacle".<ref name="Broadcast" /> The story is filmed from within a single bedroom, with much of it taking place inside the wardrobe.<ref name="Arts Desk" /><ref name="Seale">{{cite news|title= Inside No 9 - Series 1 - 1.

The episode was filmed with two wardrobes; one complete one, and one "faked" one.<ref name="Inside" /> The complete prop was used to film the characters entering the wardrobe, while the other was in a different room for close-up shots from "within" the wardrobe. For director [[David Kerr (director)|David Kerr]], the difficulty was sustaining the illusion that everything was happening in a single place, ideally without viewers even realising that there was a technical challenge involved.<ref name="KII">{{Cite episode | title= Inside Inside No. 9|publisher= ''Inside No. 9'' Series 1 DVD. BBC|date= 17 March 2014|author= Kerr, David}}</ref> The episode was filmed mostly in sequence, meaning more actors arrived as the filming continued, reflecting the fact that more characters arrive as the episode progresses.<ref name="Inside" /> Kerr aimed for a particularly "immersive" filming style on the episode, with extensive use of [[wide angle lens|wide angle]] shots. He aimed to avoid "leading" the audience with regards to the more important characters, by, for instance, "not giving [them] coverage" earlier in the episode.<ref name="KII" />

}}
Rebecca and Jeremy host their [[engagement party]] at Rebecca's family's [[stately home]]. The guests play the [[parlour game]] [[sardines (game)|sardines]], a variation of [[hide-and-seek]] in which one person hides and the other players have to join them in their hiding place once they are found. Rebecca finds Ian (who works with Jeremy) in a bedroom wardrobe. As they wait for more people to arrive, Ian mistakenly calls her "Rachel". A young man, Lee, enters the room but does not find the pair, though they are later found and joined by Rebecca's prudish brother Carl, and then Carl's flamboyant partner Stuart. Jeremy's ex-girlfriend Rachel finds the group and joins them. Ian mentions that Jeremy frequently talks about "you", but it is unclear whether he is talking to Rebecca or Rachel. To Rebecca's annoyance, Stuart, Rachel and Ian briefly leave the wardrobe for a break. Stuart enters the ''[[en suite]]'' where Geraldine is sat on the toilet. In the wardrobe, Carl and Rebecca talk; the latter is uncomfortable, and, when Rebecca asks why, he tells her to "look where we are".

Ian, Rachel and Geraldine join Rebecca and Carl. Geraldine says that the room is normally locked, but Rebecca rebukes her. Stuart rejoins the group after using the toilet. As the group talk, Mark and his wife, Liz, enter the bedroom, unaware of the people hiding in the wardrobe. The pair talk candidly before beginning foreplay and lying down on the bed. Geraldine shouts to alert them, and those in the wardrobe pretend they did not hear Mark and Liz's conversation. Mark and Liz reluctantly enter the wardrobe. As the doors close, Rachel's boyfriend Lee enters the room, but as the wardrobe has become more cramped, Stuart and Lee hide under the bed and Ian moves to the ''en suite'' bathroom. Stuart and Carl argue, and it is revealed that Carl has a fear of intimacy. When "Stinky" John enters the room, both those in the wardrobe and under the bed claim there is no room, so he hides behind a curtain. Jeremy enters the room and tells Rebecca he is going to pick up another guest from the train station, but as he turns to leave he mistakenly calls her "Rachel". Andrew, Rebecca's father, enters and becomes annoyed when he sees people hiding in different places. He forces Jeremy, Stuart, Lee and Stinky John into the wardrobe with everyone else and follows them in.

The people in the wardrobe are uncomfortable, not least because of John's odour. Geraldine passes around mints as Andrew tells Mark that he no longer has contact with Dicky Lawrence, a potential business contact of Mark's. Andrew sings the "sardine song", but Carl angrily stops him. Andrew and Geraldine reminisce about a [[Jamboree (Scouting)|scout jamboree]] held in the house many years ago, but Geraldine remembers that a boy named Phillip Harrison, nicknamed "Little Pip", said Andrew did "terrible things", and that the police were involved. Carl says how Andrew paid Pip's family to move away, and Andrew counters by claiming he did nothing to Pip and was only teaching him how to wash himself. Carl implies that he and John were not as lucky as Pip, and John says he can smell [[carbolic soap]]. There is silence, and Stuart points out no one else is looking for them, but they realise Ian has not yet returned from the bathroom. Jeremy says Ian is the person he was going to pick up from the station, but when Mark claims Ian is already at the party, Jeremy reveals the person Mark is referring to is not Ian. Outside, "Ian" locks the wardrobe and sprays it with lighter fluid while singing the sardine song. Carl realises Ian is actually Phillip, and the episode ends with Phillip leaning against the wardrobe, a lighter in his hand.

The episode is, in effect, a one-scene, [[One-act play|one-act]], play.<ref name="MSN" /><ref name="Seale" /> Writing in ''[[The Times]]'', Andrew Billen observed that [[Aristotle]] "ruled that plays should take place over a single day in a single place", while "Sardines" takes place "over half an hour in a single wardrobe".<ref name="Times" /> The use of the wardrobe is reminiscent of [[Beckettian]] [[Theatre of the Absurd|absurd theatre]],<ref name="Independent" /> and presented particular cinematographic challenges.<ref name="PopMatters" /> For Ryan Lambie, writing for entertainment website [[Den of Geek]], the [[single-camera setup]] and Kerr's direction gave the episode "the tense look of an early Hitchcock film, all low angles and illuminating shafts of light".<ref name="Den of Geek">{{cite web|title= Inside No. 9 episode 1 review: Sardines|url= http://www.denofgeek.com/tv/inside-no-9/29188/inside-no-9-episode-1-review-sardines|author=Lambie, Ryan|publisher= [[Den of Geek]]|date= 6 February 2014|accessdate= 8 June 2014}}</ref>

The characters bring their respective agendas, relationships and backstories into the wardrobe.<ref name="Stage" /> The various interconnected plotlines are seeded towards the start of the episode, and more is gradually revealed before they are resolved.<ref name="Arts Desk" /><ref name="Dessau review" /> "Sardines" starts as comedic, before becoming darker;<ref name="Dessau review" /> as more characters arrive, their relatively cordial interactions become more unpleasant.<ref name="Seale" /> The increasingly claustrophobic environment serves to heighten the tension.<ref name="Arts Desk" />

The comedy is [[dark humour|black]],<ref name="Arts Desk" /> with the most overt humour coming from Stuart, a flamboyant character played by Shearsmith.<ref name="Arts Desk" /> The humour is also extremely [[British humour|British]]. Tropes of Britishness identified by [[PopMatters]] critic David Upton include the dated clothing, and interaction between Katherine and Tim at the start of the episode. Despite not knowing each other, they converse courteously, which "smacks of more refined days";<ref name="PopMatters" /> the conversation is a "portrayal of social awkwardness".<ref name="radio" /> With the introduction of the noticeably younger Lee, there is a clash of customs, illustrating the differing norms of the respective generations.<ref name="PopMatters">{{cite news|url=http://www.popmatters.com/review/180233-inside-no.-9-series-one/|title= 'Inside No. 9' is a bit like a box of chocolates, albeit one full of dark, bitter sweets|publisher= [[PopMatters]]|author=Upton, David|date= 26 March 2014|accessdate= 21 April 2014}}</ref> This "1940s aesthetic" and the fact the story took place in a single location tied the episode to "a golden age of plays on British television".<ref name="Den of Geek" /> Broadcaster and writer [[Mark Radcliffe]] felt that the script "could be a really arresting stage play".<ref name="radio" />

As is typical of Shearsmith and Pemberton's work,<ref name="Stage" /> "Sardines" addresses dark topics.<ref name="Independent" /> Writing in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', Paul Kendall identified some of Shearsmith and Pemberton's "regular tropes" utilised in the episode; namely "a bunch of misfits, uncomfortable silences and allusions to dark crimes in the distant past".<ref name="Telegraph" /> Billen felt that the treatment of dark issues was reminiscent of the work of [[Alan Ayckbourn]].<ref name="Times" /> Particular themes addressed in the episode include murder, incestuous relationships, child sexual abuse, vengeance and adultery.<ref name="Independent" /><ref name="Stage" /> As the episode progresses, secrets related to these themes are revealed to be the explanation for apparently innocuous tendencies, such as Carl's dislike for the sardine song and John's aversion to soap.<ref name="Coventry">{{cite news|title= Dare you peek behind the door of Inside No 9|url= http://blogs.coventrytelegraph.net/passtheremote/2014/02/dare-you-peek-behind-the-door-2.html|author= McMullen, Marion|newspaper= [[Coventry Telegraph]]|date= 10 February 2014|accessdate= 1 March 2014}}</ref>

Journalists also lauded the script, with Kendall labelling the dialogue "perfectly pitched",<ref name="Telegraph" /> Dessau calling it "tightly written" and without wastage,<ref name="Dessau review" /> and Owen praising the way each character was "delivered into the story at the exact right moment".<ref name="MSN" /> Brad Newsome, writing for ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' (the episode having been shown in Australia on [[BBC First]] in 2015), said that the episode was "deftly written",<ref name="Newsome" /> and Venning said the "lean, mean narrative didn't just twist and turn, it folded back upon itself to provide a totally unexpected, profoundly disturbing and deeply satisfying denouement".<ref name="Stage" /> On The Arts Desk, Lee praised the direction of Kerr, saying that he delivered "a pitch-perfect piece with no character overwritten or line overplayed".<ref name="Arts Desk" />

Dean, writing for ''The Independent'', commended the writers' "weaving together of the morbid with the laugh-out loud",<ref name="Independent" /> and Mike Bradley, writing in ''The Observer'', called the episode "wickedly funny";<ref name="Bradley" /> similarly, Newsome said the episode displayed "a wicked sense of humour".<ref name="Newsome" /> Dessau concurred on the darkness and quality of humour.<ref name="Dessau review" /> Watson was more ambivalent, saying the episode offered "more of a knowing chuckle than an outright belly laugh".<ref name="Metro" />

Watson wrote that "the chief joy [of the episode] was the stealthy way the atmospheric story was built up layer by layer".<ref name="Metro">{{cite news|title= Inside No 9 matched Tales of the Unexpected for entertaining weirdness|url= http://metro.co.uk/2014/02/06/inside-no-9-matched-tales-of-the-unexpected-for-entertaining-weirdness-4292415/|newspaper= [[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]|date= 6 February 2014|accessdate= 6 February 2014|author=Watson, Keith}}</ref> In ''The Times'', Billen described "Sardines" as "a disciplined comedy, but a little bit of discipline, as one of the League's perverts might say, never did anyone any harm". With the exception of the ending, Billen "loved it".<ref name="Times" /> A separate review in ''The Times'', however, praised the twist ending; "this isn't just an inspired set-up performed by a stellar cast <U+2013> it builds to a macabre and horribly imagined climax."<ref name="Saturday Review" /> Owen was ambivalent about the ending of "Sardines", saying that it "worked very well in terms of narrative, but perhaps it landed with too much softness".<ref name="MSN" /> Mark Jones, writing in ''The Guardian'', gave a more mixed review overall, describing "Sardines" as a "slow burner, but a decent introduction to a series".<ref>{{cite news|title= G2: TV and radio: Watch this|newspaper= G2, [[The Guardian]]|date= 5 February 2014|authors= Wright, Jonathan; Jones, Mark; Aroesti, Rachel|page= 22}}</ref> Newsome called the episode a "gem of an opener".<ref name="Newsome">{{cite news|title= Inside No.9, (premiere), BBC First, 9.30pm|date= 31 December 2014|author= Newsome, Brad|newspaper= [[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|url= http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/tv-and-radio/monday-january-5-20141231-12fyei.html|accessdate=5 January 2014}}</ref>
