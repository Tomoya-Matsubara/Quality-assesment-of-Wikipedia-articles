"'''Jai Ho! (You Are My Destiny)'''" is a song by American [[girl group]] the [[Pussycat Dolls]] from their second album, ''[[Doll Domination#Doll Domination 2.0|Doll Domination 2.0]]''. Produced by [[Evan Bogart]], [[Ester Dean]], [[Ron Fair]], [[Gulzar]], E. Nuri, [[The Writing Camp|D. Quinones]], [[A.R. Rahman]], [[Nicole Scherzinger]] and [[Tanvi Shah]]. It was released as the third single in Europe (fourth in Oceania, United Kingdom and North America). The song is the English interpretation of the song "Jai Ho!". The English lyrics do not translate directly from the [[Hindi]] lyrics.

It was a considerable hit, reaching number one in Australia, Finland, Ireland, Lebanon and Turkey. It also reached the top three in Belgium, France, New Zealand and United Kingdom. In United States it peaked at number fifteen. The music video was shot in Vienna, Austria at a Tramway Museum, recreating the last scene from the movie ''[[Slumdog Millionaire]]'' . The English version of the song was sung by various voice actors of English children's shows during the 2009 [[Children in Need]] Promotional dance video. It was also sung in [[The Official BBC Children in Need Medley]].

=== Background ===
In 2009 [[Ron Fair]] and [[Jimmy Iovine]] wanted to make "Jai Ho!" a pop record keeping the original melody.<ref name=times/> After contacting [[A. R. Rahman]], they asked Scherzinger, to re-write and make her own version of the song. On an interview in [[DesiHits]], Nicole revealed that she didn't want to cover "Jai Ho" saying that, "[...] I was scared to death to touch it [and] afraid for people to hear it before I even wrote it."<ref name=mtvnews/> She later explained on MTV that,
<blockquote>
"It's crazy how the whole thing came about, [...]  I'm a writer, and I've been fortunate enough to write for the Dolls, but when they asked me to look at the movie and do my own version, I was really afraid to take on the task of rewriting the lyrics, [...] because I thought the movie was so profound, I didn't know how to make sure I kept the integrity of the movie and the love story, but also make it cool enough for the Pussycat Dolls and for people all over the world to connect to.<ref name=mtvnews>{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1607620/20090324/the_pussycat_dolls.jhtml|title=Nicole Scherzinger Says She Originally Didn't Want To Cover 'Jai Ho'|last=Montgomery|first=James|date=24 March 2009|accessdate=2010-07-18|work=[[MTV]]|publisher=[[MTV Networks]]}}</ref></blockquote>

=== Writing and inspiration ===
{{Quote box|width=35%|align=left|quote="Ron Fair ... and Jimmy [Iovine] had a list of writers that they wanted to send a pop version of the <U+2018>Jai Ho!<U+2019> song to. They wanted to get a bunch of different versions to see who could nail a version for the Pussycat Dolls. In the end they took parts of [[The Writing Camp]] version, parts of Ester Dean's version, and parts of another version, and they put them together, and then Nicole [Scherzinger] and Ron filled in the blanks that they thought were missing. It's a very unique and awkward way of writing a song."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_Evan_Bogart_Interview.html|title=Interview With Evan 'Kidd' Bogart|first=Kimbel|last=Bouwman|date=8 February 2010|work=[[HitQuarters]]|accessdate=2010-05-19}}</ref>|source=<U+2014>Evan Bogart described the process of writing "Jai Ho!

Reviews for "Jai Ho (You Are My Destiny)" were mainly positive. Bill Lamb from [[About.com]] gave the song 4.5 out of five stars. "The addition of the Pussycat Dolls to the song may have seemed a questional decision at first glance, but it is this move that is likely to get the joyful explosion on to pop radio playlists. "Jai Ho!" abundantly deserves its place, and the vocals of head Pussycat Doll Nicole Scherzinger will have pop fans singing as well as dancing along.

(You Are My Destiny) " along with "[[I Hate This Part]]" on ''[[MuchOnDemand]]'' aired on [[MuchMusic]] in [[Toronto]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rap-up.com/2009/03/18/pussycat-dolls-take-over-toronto/#more-14087|title=Pussycat Dolls Take Over Toronto|publisher=Devine Lazerine|work=[[Rap-Up]]|date=18 March 2009|accessdate=2010-11-17}}</ref> They also performed the song with a medley of "[[When I Grow Up (Pussycat Dolls song)|When I Grow Up]]" on [[2009 Kids' Choice Awards]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rap-up.com/2009/03/29/nickelodeon-kids-choice-awards-2009/|title=Nickelodeon Kids<U+2019> Choice Awards 2009|publisher=Devine Lazerine|work=[[Rap-Up]]|date=27 March 2009|accessdate=2010-11-17}}</ref> They also performed on ''[[The Ellen DeGeneres Show]]'' on 20 April 2009. Andrew Winistorfer from Prefix Magazine commented on their appearance at Ellen. "I wonder what it's like to be a Pussycat Doll. You used to spend your time writhing onstage for the likes of Charlie Sheen, and then you become a "singer" and your career basically becomes an escalation of sexual exploits in videos because even you know that no one is buying your records for the music. [...] Then you have to go on Ellen and perform the song like it means anything to you when obviously you don't care about the song in the least, but you are only there because it beats being in front of Jeremy Piven every night. It must be a sad existence."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.prefixmag.com/media/pussycat-dolls/jai-ho-live-on-ellen-video/28278/|title=Pussycat Dolls: "Jai Ho" (Live on Ellen) (Video)|publisher=Prefix Magazine|last=Winistorfer|first=Andrew|date=21 April 2009|accessdate=2010-11-18}}</ref> On 13 May 2009, the Pussycat Dolls performed at American [[soap opera]] ''[[One Life to Live]]'' The plot involves the students of Llanview High School won a radio contest and had been awarded a performance by The Pussycat Dolls.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://onelifetolive.about.com/od/news/a/pr_release032409.htm|title=Pussycat Dolls to Appear on 'One Life to Live'|publisher=[[About.com]]|last=Thurston|first=Katherine|date=|accessdate=2010-11-17}}</ref> The song was also performed at their ''[[Doll Domination Tour]]'', at [[The Circus Starring Britney Spears|The Circus Tour]], Oceanian and Asian legs.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.torontosun.com/entertainment/music/2009/03/18/8800801-sun.html|title=Britney brings Circus to town|work=[[Toronto Sun]]|last=Stevenson|first=Jane|date=19 March 2009|accessdate=2010-11-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.torontosun.com/entertainment/music/2009/03/18/8800801-sun.html|title=Pussycat Dolls tour has everyone Gaga|work=[[The Newcastle Herald]]|last=Edwards|first=Amy|date=22 May 2009|accessdate=2010-11-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mb.com.ph/node/206744|title=Pussycat Dolls: Fair attendance, fab performance|work=[[Manila Bulletin]]|last=Panaligan|first=Jojo P.|date=12 June 2009|accessdate=2010-11-18}}</ref>
