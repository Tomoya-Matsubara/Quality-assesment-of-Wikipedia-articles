'''John Wark''' (born 4 August 1957) is a [[Scotland|Scottish]] former [[football (soccer)|footballer]] who spent most of his playing time with [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]].  He won a record four [[List of Ipswich Town F.C. Players of the Year|Player of the Year]] awards before becoming one of the four inaugural members of the club's [[Ipswich Town F.C. Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]]. Wark had long spells at the club, which bookended his career, and a third, brief interlude dividing his briefer periods at [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]]. A versatile player, Wark played most of his professional games as a [[midfield]]er, although he sometimes played as a [[central defender]] and on occasion as a [[forward (football)|striker]].

Born in [[Glasgow]], Wark represented [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] in international football, winning 29 caps and scoring seven goals. This included selection for Scotland in the [[1982 FIFA World Cup]] in which he made three appearances and scored twice.

During his playing career, Wark appeared in the film ''[[Escape to Victory]]''. Since retiring as a professional player in 1996, he has continued to work for Ipswich Town<U+2014>since April 2009 in the corporate hospitality department. His autobiography was published in 2009.

==Early life==
Wark was born on 4 August 1957, in [[Glasgow Royal Maternity Hospital]] to parents Alex and Helen. The third of four children, he has an older sister Wilma, older brother [[Alex Wark|Alex]] and younger brother Andrew.<ref>{{Cite book| last = Wark | chapter = I belong to Glasgow|page=16}}</ref>  The family lived in a four-storey [[Apartment building#Scotland|tenement block]] in [[Partick]]. The family was impoverished: Wark's parents could not afford a cot and as a small child, he slept in a drawer from a sideboard.<ref>{{Cite book| last = Wark | page=17}}</ref>  Although [[Infant baptism|christened]] John, Wark was soon referred to by his family as Johnny, a [[Hypocorism#Diminutive|diminutive]] which stuck throughout his footballing career.<ref>{{Cite book| last = Wark | page=19}}</ref>

In the early 1960s, the family moved to another tenement block, this time in [[Scotstoun]], and Wark's father secured employment at nearby [[Albion Motors]]. The new home accommodated a back yard in which Wark played football from the age of six.  He said "[f]ootball seemed to occupy 99 per cent of my time as a youngster"<ref>{{Cite book| last = Wark | pages=22<U+2013>24}}</ref> as he tried to emulate his brother Alex, who had become a professional at [[St. Mirren F.C.|St. Mirren]].<ref>{{Cite book| last = Wark | chapter= On trial | page=26}}</ref> Wark attended [[Scotstoun Primary School]], where he became captain of the football team. On moving to secondary school, he was selected for the Glasgow Schools representative team.<ref>{{Cite book| last = Wark | page=28}}</ref>  He also played for [[Drumchapel Amateur F.C.|Drumchapel Amateurs]] at the under-14 level, where he was, for a period, managed by [[David Moyes]]' father, also named David.<ref>{{Cite book| last = Wark | pages=29<U+2013>30}}</ref>

During Wark's time at Drumchapel, he attracted the attention of [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]]. He trained with the club at their [[Celtic Park|Parkhead]] ground, before receiving an invitation to sign schoolboy forms for the club. As a lifelong [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] fan (with whom Celtic have a notable rivalry)<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/5289202.stm | title = A rivalry tied up in religion| publisher = BBC News| accessdate = 2009-05-15| date = 2006-08-26}}</ref> and with interest from "several English clubs", including [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]], [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] and [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]], Wark stalled on the offer.<ref>{{Cite book| last = Wark | pages=30<U+2013>31}}</ref> He trialled with both Ipswich Town and Manchester City, and selected Ipswich when the latter remained non-committal. On arrival at [[Portman Road]], Town manager [[Bobby Robson]], later described by Wark as the person in football "who had the single biggest influence on [him]",<ref>{{Cite book| last = Wark | page=36}}</ref> personally welcomed him and Wark signed with the club as an apprentice.<ref>{{Cite book | last = Wark | page=33}}</ref>

==Domestic playing career==
===First spell at Ipswich===

Wark started his career at Ipswich in the youth team, initially playing at [[Defender (association football)#Full back|left back]] before moving to the centre of defence and occasionally occupying the [[Defender (association football)#Full back|right back]] position.<ref>{{Cite book| last = Wark | pages=33<U+2013>37}}</ref> He signed up as a professional for the club on his 17th birthday.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Wark|page=43}}</ref> Selected for the senior squad as a replacement for the injured [[Kevin Beattie]], Wark made his first-team debut on 27 March 1975 in the 3<U+2013>2 [[FA Cup]] 6th round (3rd replay) victory over [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]];<ref>{{Cite web |url = http://www.soccerbase.com/results2.sd?teamid=1372&seasonid=104 | publisher = Soccerbase| title = Ipswich 1974/1975 results and fixtures|accessdate=2009-05-15}}</ref>{{#tag:ref|Ipswich and Leeds United had already featured in three draws in the sixth round of the [[FA Cup 1974<U+2013>75]].

<blockquote>
"My debut was in the quarter-final of the FA Cup against the Leeds team of [[John Giles|Giles]] and [[Billy Bremner|Bremner]]. He [Robson] said, 'I wouldn't put you in the team if I didn't think you were good enough'. He was a father figure as well because I was homesick. If it hadn't been for the boss I would have been straight back to Glasgow."<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/international/england/2325875/Tributes-to-Sir-Bobby-Robson.html| title = Tributes to Sir Bobby Robson| accessdate = 2009-04-28 | work = Daily Telegraph | date = 2007-11-16}}</ref>
</blockquote>

Making four more first-team appearances in place of injured regulars, Wark ended the season still on the youth team, and experienced success in the final of the [[FA Youth Cup]], defeating [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] 5&ndash;1.<ref>{{Cite book|pages=43<U+2013>44|last=Wark}}</ref> He spent much of the 1975&ndash;76 season playing for the reserves, and was presented with the club's Young Player of the Year award, despite making just four appearances for the senior team.<ref>{{Cite book | pages=45<U+2013>46|last=Wark}}</ref> Moving into [[midfield]], Wark made over 30 appearances in the 1976<U+2013>77 season, scoring his first goals for the club, (10, in all)<ref name=stats/> taking over [[penalty kick]]ing duty; he also received his first [[Penalty card#Red card|red card]].<ref>{{Cite book | pages=47<U+2013>49|last=Wark}}</ref>

In the June of 1977, Wark was selected for [[Scotland national football team|the Scotland squad]] for the first time, for a friendly match against [[East Germany national football team|East Germany]];<ref name=tocap/> however, a torn hamstring sustained in [[Season (sports)#Pre-season|pre-season training]] ended any chance of an international debut.<ref name=tocap/> The injury also kept him out of first-team football until January 1978, when he returned for a match against [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] in the third round of the [[FA Cup 1977<U+2013>78|1977<U+2013>78 FA Cup]].<ref name=tocap>{{Cite book | pages=51<U+2013>52|last=Wark|chapter=To cap it all}}</ref>

Indifferent league performances that season meant that Ipswich finished just three points above the [[Promotion and relegation|relegation zone]],<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.soccerbase.com/league2.sd?teamid=1372&seasonid=107 | title = Final 1977/1978 English Division 1 (old) Table | accessdate = 2009-05-15|publisher = Soccerbase}}</ref> but the season ended in [[FA Cup 1977<U+2013>78|success in the FA Cup]].

Twice in the three seasons that followed, Ipswich came within one game of winning the [[Football League First Division|League championship]], but finished as runners-up to Liverpool and [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]], respectively. However, Ipswich did win the club's only [[UEFA|European trophy]]<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.itfc.co.uk/page/ClubHistory/0,,10272~347323,00.html| title = Club honours| publisher = Ipswich Town F.C. | accessdate = 2009-05-21}}</ref> when they lifted the [[UEFA Cup]] in [[UEFA Cup 1980<U+2013>81|1981]].

===Liverpool===
The [[Transfer (football)#Medical examination|medical examination]] for Wark's transfer somewhat surprised him:
<blockquote>
"I was rather taken aback when the doctor entered the Anfield [[The Boot Room|boot room]]," Wark said. "He was small in stature and I could not help but detect the smell of [[alcohol]] on his breath as he introduced himself to me. I was even more surprised when he announced we would stay put to conduct the medical examination. "He took my [[blood pressure]], looked at the reading and muttered 'that's fine'. Then something happened that to this day I still cannot get over. He asked me to bend down and touch my toes. "Trying not to show my surprise, I did exactly as he asked and as I lifted my head he spoke again, this time to announce 'you've passed'. That was it, my Liverpool medical."<ref name="medical">{{Cite web | url = http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/liverpool-fc/liverpool-fc-news/2009/04/16/john-wark-s-big-fear-i-may-not-get-a-game-for-liverpool-100252-23401159/|title=John Wark's big fear - I may not get a game for Liverpool p.1|work=Liverpool Echo| accessdate =2009-04-21|date=2009-04-16|first=James |last=Pearce}}</ref>

Ipswich had been relegated 18 months before Wark's return to the club and were still playing in the [[Football League Division Two|second tier of English football]].<ref name=p115/> During this second spell at Ipswich, Wark was close to being an ever-present in the side: he missed just two games in two seasons.<ref name=stats/> He was the club's equal top-scorer in the [[1988<U+2013>89 in English football|1988<U+2013>89 season]], sharing the achievement with [[Striker (football)|forward]]s [[Dalian Atkinson]] and [[Jason Dozzell]].<ref>{{Cite book | last = Wark | page=119}}</ref>

Remaining without a club before the start of the [[1991<U+2013>92 in English football|1991<U+2013>92 season]], Wark trained with Ipswich to keep fit, and rejected interest in his services from [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Leyton Orient]], [[Colchester United F.C.|Colchester United]] and [[Falkirk F.C.|Falkirk]].<ref name=p126>{{Cite book | last=Wark|pages=126<U+2013>127|chapter=Renaissance man}}</ref> When Ipswich suffered a succession of injuries among their defenders, they offered him a contract, initially on a week-by-week basis, before securing a year-long deal.<ref name=p126/>  Wark made 43 appearances in the first season of his third spell with the club.<ref name=stats/> Early results in the season were excellent; the club won seven of their first 11 matches in the league.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.soccerbase.com/results2.sd?teamid=1372&seasonid=121 | title = Ipswich 1991/1992 results and fixtures|publisher=Soccerbase|accessdate=2009-06-15}}</ref> In the FA Cup, Ipswich progressed to a fifth round encounter against Liverpool; when the tie went to a replay at [[Anfield]], Wark received a standing ovation from both sets of fans.<ref name=p128to129>{{Cite book | last=Wark|pages=128<U+2013>129}}</ref> Ipswich lost the match, and their league form subsided somewhat thereafter, but they were still crowned Second Division champions and were promoted into the newly formed [[Premier League]].<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/football_league/article6157523.ece| title = Hopes that glory years will return to Ipswich | work = The Times | first = Tom |last=Dart| accessdate = 2009-04-28|date = 2009-04-24}}</ref>  Wark ended the season as the club's Player of the Year for the third time.<ref name=poty/>

Ipswich and Wark fared worse in the [[1994<U+2013>95 in English football|1994<U+2013>95 season]].  The club lost 9<U+2013>0 to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] during a season in which Ipswich "recorded fewer victories and suffered more defeats than in any campaign in the club's history".<ref name=p136>{{Cite book | last=Wark | page=136}}</ref>  Wark made fewer than 20 appearances in the following season, primarily because of a persistent foot injury.<ref name=p136/> Despite his appearance in three more matches in the [[1996<U+2013>97 in English football|1996<U+2013>97 season]], and a [[Testimonial match|testimonial]] against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] at Portman Road, Wark played his last professional match against [[Tranmere Rovers F.C.|Tranmere Rovers]] on 30 November 1996.<ref name=p136/>  Of a total 826 league matches played by Wark as a professional, he made 679 appearances for Ipswich.<ref name=stats/> {{As of|2009|6|5}}, he is Ipswich Town's third-highest all-time scorer, with 179 goals scored for the club, despite rarely appearing as a striker.<ref name=stats/>

==International playing career==
From 1979, Wark was selected to play for his country, usually as a defender,<ref>{{Cite book |last=Wark|chapter=Scotland the Brave|page=139}}</ref> eventually winning 29 caps for [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] and scoring seven goals.<ref name=stats/> [[Jock Stein]] was the Scotland manager who gave him his debut, in a game held on 19 May 1979, a [[1979 British Home Championship|British Home Championship]] match against [[Wales national football team|Wales]] at [[Ninian Park]]; Scotland lost 3<U+2013>0.<ref name="PFA">{{cite web|url=http://www.givemefootball.com/pfa-centenary/pfa-centenary-auction---more-tributes-to-the-stars|title=PFA Centenary Auction - more tributes to the stars featured in this unique collection|last=Nannestad|first=Ian|date=2007-11-14|publisher=Professional Footballers' Association|accessdate=2009-04-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scottishfa.co.uk/international_fixture_details.cfm?page=463&matchID=57471|title=Jock Stein: Wales 3<U+2013>0 Scotland|publisher=Scottish Football Association|accessdate=2009-04-25}}</ref> Wark scored his first international goal a week later on 26 May, again in a British Home Championship game, this time against [[England national football team|England]] at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]].

After a 3<U+2013>1 home defeat by [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] in December 1979, Wark was not selected again for his country until February 1981 for the [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982 World Cup]] qualifying match away against [[Israel national football team|Israel]].<ref name=stats/> Following a successful qualification campaign,<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.scottishfa.co.uk/scottish_football.cfm?page=133 | title=World Cup History | accessdate = 2009-06-01|publisher = Scottish Football Association}}</ref> Wark was included in the Scotland squad that went to the World Cup in Spain under Stein's leadership.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/edition=59/teams/team=43967.html|title=1982 FIFA World Cup Teams: Scotland|publisher=F<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ration Internationale de Football Association (FIFA)|accessdate=2009-04-25}}</ref> Wark played three games and scored two goals,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/statisticsandrecords/players/player=59816/index.html|title=FIFA Player Statistics: John Wark|publisher=F<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ration Internationale de Football Association (FIFA)|accessdate=2009-04-25}}</ref> both of which were in a single match against [[New Zealand national football team|New Zealand]], a game Scotland won 5<U+2013>2.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/edition=59/results/matches/match=1051/report.html|title=1982 FIFA World Cup Spain: Scotland <U+2013> New Zealand|publisher=F<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ration Internationale de Football Association (FIFA)|accessdate=2009-04-25}}</ref> Scotland were knocked out in the group stage.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/edition=59/results/index.html | publisher = F<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ration Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) | accessdate = 2009-04-29 | title = 1982 FIFA World Cup Spain}}</ref>

==Life outside football==

===Personal life===

=== Film appearance ===

In 1981, alongside other professional footballers including [[Bobby Moore]] and [[Pel<U+00E9>]], Wark was recruited to act in the [[World War II|the Second World War]] football film ''[[Escape to Victory]]'', which starred [[Sylvester Stallone]], [[Michael Caine]] and [[Max Von Sydow]].<ref name="escape">{{Cite web| url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/scotland/article6005964.ece| title = Terry Butcher calls for Scott Brown to walk in John Wark<U+2019>s footsteps | date = 2009-03-31| accessdate = 2009-04-30 | work = The Times | first = Phil | last = Gordon}}</ref> Wark played a character called Arthur Hayes,<ref>{{Cite book|last=Wark|page=157}}</ref> but his only line had to be dubbed due to his broad Glaswegian accent.<ref name=escape/>

===Since retirement as a player===
Following his retirement from playing football professionally, Wark continued to live in Suffolk, like many other ex-Ipswich players, including [[Allan Hunter (footballer)|Allan Hunter]], [[Mick Mills]], [[Roger Osborne]] and [[Mick Lambert]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Wark|page=61}}</ref> Wark told local radio station [[Heart Network|Heart]] that "after my retirement from football I made a conscious decision to stay in Ipswich, as it has been my hometown for a major part of my life."<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.heartipswich.co.uk/Article.asp?id=367551 | publisher = Heart Network| accessdate = 2009-05-15| title = Have a Heart patrons}}</ref>  Despite his retirement from the professional ranks, Wark continued playing football as an amateur, and signed for [[Woodbridge Town F.C.|Woodbridge Town]] in 1999 alongside former Ipswich team-mate [[Paul Mason (footballer)|Paul Mason]].<ref name="amat">{{Cite web | url = http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-nonleague-notebook-wark-eyes-wembley-1071820.html|title = Football: Non-League Notebook: Wark eyes Wembley | work=The Independent|first=Rupert|last= Metcalf|accessdate=2009-05-27|date=1999-02-19}}</ref> He also played veterans football for Windsor and Eton,<ref name="amat"/> played with [[Soccer AM]]'s ''Badgers'' team at the [[Millennium Stadium]],<ref>{{Cite book|last=Wark|page=164}}</ref> and has represented the Liverpool veterans in the Sky Sports [[Masters Football|Masters]] series.<ref>{{Cite web | title = Football: Butcher can give Gers the chop Says John Wark| accessdate = 2009-05-15 | work=Sunday Mirror|date = 2005-03-13 | first = Ewan|last= Smith| url= http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_20050313/ai_n12944582/}}</ref>

===Autobiography===
Wark's autobiography ''Wark On'' was published on 9 April 2009.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.amazon.co.uk/Wark-Autobiography-John/dp/1848185111| title = Wark on: The Autobiography of John Wark (Hardcover)|accessdate = 2009-04-28|publisher = Amazon}}</ref> The book contained material that gained media interest.  Wark stated that he made "a small fortune by [[sales|flogging]] tickets for the FA Cup Final to a [[black market|shady underworld ticket tout]]".<ref name="Sun">{{Cite web | url = http://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/scotsol/homepage/news/article2320610.ece|work=The Scottish Sun | accessdate=2009-05-27|title=Wark: My secret is tout|last=Tait|first=Gordon|date=2009-03-16}}</ref> "Wark used his share of the cash to help pay for his wedding while  a team-mate bankrolled a house extension. He added: "Other teams had done it, so why shouldn<U+2019>t we?  Nowadays it<U+2019>s illegal but in those days it was regarded as a perk."<ref name="Sun"/> The report also highlighted Wark's "dig" at the current "crop of stars" at Anfield. He said: "None of that lot would have been good enough in my time at Anfield."<ref name="Sun"/>

==Playing style and personality==
Wark played as a central defender,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/brave-ipswich-rely-on-the-wright-stuff-1324470.html|title=Brave Ipswich rely on the Wright stuff |last=Allsop|first=Derick|date=1996-01-17|work=The Independent|accessdate=2009-04-25}}</ref> midfielder and, occasionally, as a striker.<ref>{{Cite book | last = Wark | pages=121<U+2013>122|quote=... I had a brief run as a makeshift striker alongside [[Chris Kiwomya]]...}}</ref> Wark was an unusual player; he was able to play as a defensive midfielder yet break forward to score. According to former team-mate [[Terry Butcher]], this was because his colleagues would drop back to cover for him: "I played with John Wark, who was a sitting midfielder but was one of the top scorers in England and Europe. If you see it, then do it, as long as the others spot it and cover for you."<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1166006/My-war-rouse-nation-Butcher-calls-Scotland-ice-Icelanders.html?ITO=1490|title = My war cry to rouse a nation: Butcher calls for Scotland to ice the Icelanders| accessdate=2009-05-27|date=2009-03-31|work=Daily Mail|last=McGowan|first=Stephen}}</ref>

Wark was not a "supremely talented" player, but, according to football journalist [[Jim White (journalist)|Jim White]],  one who espoused team-work and team spirit: "There is no question that the 'one-for-all, all-for-one' mentality generated in the Anfield dressing room was the engine that drove the great team. With players such as [[Alan Kennedy]], John Wark, [[Sammy Lee (footballer)|Sammy Lee]] and [[Craig Johnston]], nobody could claim this was a collection of top-notch operators in the manner, say, of the current [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]]. Every week, they played as an entity greater than the sum of its parts."<ref>{{Cite book | first = David|last= Bolchover | title = The 90-minute manager| isbn= 0273693840 |publisher=Prentice Hall|page=209}}</ref>  He has been described as "a defensive midfielder with an astonishing goalscoring record".<ref>{{Cite web|url =http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/2298557/PFA-Player-of-the-Year-winners-1974-2007.html|title = PFA Player of the Year winners 1974-2007|accessdate= 2009-05-27|date=2008-04-28|first=Emily|last= Benammar|work=The Daily Telegraph}}</ref>

While playing, Wark retained the ability to be humorous and friendly even with the fiercest of rivals. Former [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] [[goalkeeper]], [[Bryan Gunn]], recalls one of his most "memorable [[East Anglian derby|derby]] moments":

<blockquote>
"one of the best was in the ... 1995<U+2013>96 season, when [[referee (football)|referee]] [[Kevin Lynch (referee)|Kevin Lynch]] awarded [Ipswich] Town their second [[Penalty kick|penalty]] of the game ... John Wark and I were having a bit of a laugh. I asked him where he was going to put his penalty and he said 'In the back of the net'."<ref>{{Cite web|url =  http://www.eveningnews24.co.uk/content/Sport/BryanGunn/story.aspx?brand=ENOnline&category=BryanGunn&tBrand=ENOnline&tCategory=BryanGunn&itemid=NOED17%20Apr%202009%2011%3A47%3A43%3A627 | title = It was an Ullathorne own goal, okay! Say no more| accessdate=2009-05-27|date=2009-04-17|work=Norwich Evening News|last=Gunn|first=Bryan}}</ref>
</blockquote>

Wark remained modest and able to take a joke at his own expense, for example in this story recounted by former Scotland team mate, [[Gordon Strachan]]:
<blockquote>
"[[Jock Stein|Jock]] ... said to John Wark one day ... 'John, is it fair to say if you're no' scoring goals you're nae use to us?' and John just sat there and said 'aye, have to agree'."<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://sport.scotsman.com/jockstein/From-Celtic-to-Cardiff-a.2660135.jp|title = From Celtic to Cardiff a new chapter unfolds|work=The Scotsman|accessdate=2009-05-27|date=2005-09-11}}</ref>
</blockquote>

Over the years, Wark has become closely associated with his moustache. [[Owen Slot]] described the player as "Ipswich's immortal moustache",<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/exhibition--spectator-sport-turning-his-back-on-the-football-field-julian-germain-takes-photographs-of-aspiring-fanatics-owen-slot-calls-the-shots-1394887.html|work = The Independent | accessdate = 2009-05-08 | date = 1994-02-18| title =Spectator sport: Turning his back on the football field, Julian Germain takes photographs of aspiring fanatics.
