{{Refimprove|date=August 2007}}'''Michael Ferris''' ([[21 November]] [[1931]] &ndash; [[20 March]] [[2000]]) was an [[Ireland|Irish]] [[Irish Labour Party|Labour Party]] politician who served for more than twenty years as a member of the [[Oireachtas]], as both a [[Seanad <U+00C9>ireann|Senator]] and a [[Teachta D<U+00E1>la|TD]]. Before becoming a full-time politician, he was secretary to a veterinary practice.

Ferris was a native of [[Bansha]], County Tipperary, and it was here in the 1950s, that he came under the influence of Very Rev. John Canon Hayes, Founder of [[Muintir na T<U+00ED>re]] and adopted many of his ideas for rural development embracing all sections of the community in an inclusive way.  He was elected to the [[13th Seanad]] by the [[Agricultural Panel]] in a by-election on [[23 April]] [[1975]].  At the [[Irish general election, 1977|1977 general election]], he was an unsuccessful candidate for [[D<U+00E1>il <U+00C9>ireann]] in the [[Tipperary South (D<U+00E1>il <U+00C9>ireann constituency)|Tipperary South]] constituency, and was also defeated in the subsequent Seanad elections.  He was re-elected in [[1981]] to the [[15th Seanad]], and returned again in [[1982]] and [[1983]].

At the [[Irish general election, 1987|1987 general election]], he unsuccessfully stood again in [[Tipperary South (D<U+00E1>il <U+00C9>ireann constituency)|Tipperary South]], but was afterwards re-elected to the  [[18th Seanad]], again on the [[Agricultural Panel (Seanad <U+00C9>ireann)|Agricultural Panel]].
In the [[1989]] elections to the [[European Parliament]] on [[15 June]], He was defeated in the [[Munster]] constituency, trailing far behind his Labour colleague [[Eileen Desmond]], who narrowly missed a seat.  However, polling in the [[Irish general election, 1989|1989 general election]] was held on the same day, and he was finally elected to [[D<U+00E1>il <U+00C9>ireann]], taking his seat in the [[26th D<U+00E1>il]] on his third attempt.  He was re-elected at the [[Irish general election, 1992|1992 general election]] and again at the [[Irish general election, 1997|1997 general election]], taking the last seat in each case.

He died suddenly while on parliamentary business in [[Lisbon]] on [[20 March]] [[2000]] at the age of 69. The subsequent by-election for his D<U+00E1>il seat was held on [[2 June]] and won by an [[:Category:Irish independent politicians|independent]] candidate, [[S<U+00E9>amus Healy]], who retained the seat at the [[Irish general election, 2002|2002 general election]]. Ferris was the quintessential rural Labour TD, garnering support across party lines, especially from small farmers and the rural working class, quite in disproportion to the level of national support generally enjoyed by his party. He championed the rural agricultural economy and was Chairman of the Bansha Agricultural & Industrial Show Society for a number of years. In private life, Deputy Ferris was married twice, firstly to Josephine Tobin of Bansha and after her death to Ella Kiely of Tipperary Town who survives him as do his four sons and two daughters.
