'''''Rocko's Modern Life''''' is an American TV [[animated series]], the fourth of [[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon's]] [[Nicktoons]], created by [[Joe Murray (animator)|Joe Murray]] and aired for four seasons from 1993 to 1996. ''Rocko's Modern Life'' was based around the [[surreal humour|surreal]], [[Parody|parodic]] adventures of an [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] [[wallaby]] named [[Rocko]], and his life in the city of O-Town. The program was produced by [[Joe Murray Productions]] and [[Games Productions]]. The show is laden with [[double entendre]]s,        [[innuendo]]s, and social commentary.

==History==
Originally, the character Rocko appeared in an unpublished comic book titled ''Ugly''. Murray tried selling the comic book in the late 1980s, between illustrating jobs, and did not find success in getting it into production. Many other characters appeared in various sketchbooks. He described the early 1990s animation atmosphere as "ripe for this kind of project. We took some chances that would be hard to do in these poopy times (the 1990s)".<ref name="MurrayRockoHome">
"[http://www.joemurraystudio.com/tv/rocko.shtml Rocko's Modern Life]," ''[[Joe Murray (animator)|Joe Murray]] Studio''
</ref> Murray wanted funding for his independent film ''My Dog Zero'', so he wanted Nickelodeon to pre-buy television rights for the series. He presented a pencil test to [[Nickelodeon Animation Studios|Nickelodeon Animation]], which afterward became interested in buying and financing the show.

[[Linda Simensky]], then in charge of animation development in Nickelodeon, described the [[Nicktoons]] lineup and concept to Murray. He originally felt skepticism towards the concept of creating a Nicktoon as he disliked television cartoons. Simensky told him that Nicktoons differed from other cartoons. He told her that he believed that ''My Dog Zero'' would not work as a cartoon. He then researched Nickelodeon at the library and found that Nickelodeon's "attitude was different than regular TV." Murray combed through his sketchbooks, developed the ''Rocko's Modern Life'' concept, and submitted it to Nickelodeon, believing that the concept would likely be rejected. According to Murray, around three or four months later he had "forgotten about" the concept and was working on ''My Dog Zero'' when Simensky informed him that Nickelodeon wanted a pilot episode. Murray said that he was glad that he would get funding for ''My Dog Zero''.<ref name="TrainorMurray">

</ref> "Sucker for the Suck-O-Matic" was originally written as the pilot; the executives decided that [[Heffer Wolfe]], one of the characters, would be "a little too weird for test audiences." Murray, instead of removing Heffer from "Sucker for the Suck-O-Matic," decided to write "[[Trash-O-Madness]]" as the pilot episode.<ref name="TrainorMurray"/>

When the series was in development prior to the release of the first episode, the series had the title '''''The Rocko Show'''''.<ref name="Sumares">

In 1992, two months prior to the production of season 1 of ''Rocko's Modern Life'', Murray's first wife committed suicide.<ref>

He describes the experience as like participating in "marathon with my [[trousers|pants]] around my [[ankles]]."

After season 3 he decided to hand the project to [[Stephen Hillenburg]], who performed most work for season 4; Murray continued to manage the cartoon.<ref name="TrainorMurray"/> He said that he would completely leave the production after season 4. He said also that he encouraged the network to continue production, but Nickelodeon eventually decided to cancel the series. He described all fifty-two episodes as "top notch", and in his view the quality of a television show may decline as production continues "when you are dealing with volume."<ref name="TrainorMurray"/> On his website he said that, "In some ways it succeeded and in some ways failed.

==Production==
Murray's Joe Murray Productions and [[Games Animation]] rented office space on [[Ventura Boulevard]] in the [[Studio City, Los Angeles, California|Studio City]] neighborhood of the [[San Fernando Valley]] region of [[Los Angeles]], [[California]].<ref>

</ref> According to Murray, as ''Rocko's Modern Life'' was his first television series, he did not know about the atmosphere of typical animation studios. Murray said that he opted to operate his studio in a similar manner to the operation of his [[Saratoga, California|Saratoga]], [[California]] studio, which he describes as "Very relaxed."<ref name="TrainorMurray"/> His cadre included many veterans who, according to him, described the experience as "the most fun they had ever had!" He, saying that the atmosphere was "not my doing," credited his team members for collectively contributing.<ref name="TrainorMurray"/> Murray described the daily atmosphere at the studio as "very loose," adding that the rules permitted all staff members to use the paging system to make announcements.

Murray produced the pilot episode, "[[The Good, The Bad, and The Wallaby / Trash-O-Madness|Trash-O-Madness]]", at his studio in Saratoga; he animated half of the episode, and the production occurred entirely in the United States, with animation in Saratoga and processing in [[San Francisco]].<ref>

Several members of the ''Rocko'' crew would later join Stephen Hillenburg in production of a famous Nicktoon, ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'', including [[SpongeBob SquarePants (character)|SpongeBob]] voice [[Tom Kenny]], who voiced [[Heffer Wolfe]] and other characters on ''Rocko's Modern Life''.

Creator ''Joe Murray'' later went on to create the [[Cartoon Network]] show ''[[Camp Lazlo]]''.

[[Pat Irwin]] later went on to work on ''[[Pepper Ann]]'' and "JetCat" from ''[[KaBlam!]]''.

Storyboard artist Robert Porter later went to work on [[CatDog]] with [[Peter Hannan (producer)|Peter Hannan]] and [[Derek Drymon]].

[[Jeff "Swampy" Marsh]] and [[Dan Povenmire]] later went on to create the hit Disney Channel animated series, ''[[Phineas and Ferb]]''.

===Writing style===
The writers aimed to create stories that they describe as "strong" and "funny." The writers, including [[George Maestri]] and [[Martin Olson]], often presented ideas to Murray while eating [[hamburgers]] at Rocky's, a restaurant formerly located on Lankershim in the [[North Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|North Hollywood]] section of the San Fernando Valley. He took his team members on "writing trips" to places such as Rocky's, the [[LaBrea Tar Pits]], and the wilderness. If he liked the story premises, the writers produced full outlines from the premises. Outlines approved by both him and Nickelodeon became ''Rocko's Modern Life'' episodes. Maestri describes some stories as originating from "real life" and some originating from "thin air."<ref>

</ref> Murray stated that each episode of ''Rocko's Modern Life'' stemmed from the personal experiences of himself and/or one or more of the directors or writers.<ref name="TrainorMurray"/> He said that he did not intend to use formulaic writing seen in other cartoons; he desired content that "broke new ground" and "did things that rode the edge," and that could be described as "unexpected." He did not hire writers who had previous experience with writing cartoons, instead hiring writers who worked outside of animation, including improv actors and comic artists. He said that story concepts that "ever smacked close to some formula idea that we had all seen before" received rejection.<ref name="WackyRockoDesignProcess">

Jeff "Swampy" Marsh, a storyboard writer, says that writers of ''Rocko's Modern Life'' targeted children and adults. He cites ''[[Rocky and Bullwinkle]]'' as an example of another series that contains references undecipherable by children and understood by adults. Aiming for a similar goal, Marsh described the process as "a hard job." According to him, when censors questioned proposed material, sometimes the team disagreed with the opinions of the censors and sometimes the team agreed with the rationale of the censors. He says that "many people" told him that the team "succeeded in this endevour" {{Sic}} and that "many parents I know really enjoyed watching the show with their kids for just this reason."<ref name="Marsh">

===Animation style===
Murray's animation lacked parallel lines and featured crooked architecture similar to various [[Chuck Jones]] cartoons.

===Music===
There are 3 versions of the ''Rocko's Modern Life'' theme song. The first and original version can be heard playing throughout season one and was composed by Pat Irwin, who also composed the series' background music. The second version of the theme song was a slightly remixed version of the first and was only used during episodes 8 and 9 of season one. One of the changes included high pitched voices added to the chorus. The third version of the theme song was performed by [[Kate Pierson]] and [[Fred Schneider]] from [[The B-52's]]. They performed the ''Rocko's Modern Life'' theme song from Season 2 onwards.
At first Murray wanted Paul Sumares to perform the theme song since Sumares created most of the music found in ''My Dog Zero.'' Murray wanted the same style in ''My Dog Zero'' exhibited in ''Rocko's Modern Life''. Nickelodeon wanted a person with more experience.<ref name="Sumares"/> According to Sumares, believing for the request to be a long shot, Murray asked for [[Danny Elfman]] and felt stunned when Nickelodeon decided to honor his request by asking Elfman to perform.<ref name="Sumares"/> According to Murray, Elfman, his first choice, was booked. Therefore he chose the B-52's, his second choice.<ref name="Sumares"/> According to Sumares Murray decided to use the B-52's instead of Elfman. Murray states that the difference between the stories "could just be a recollection conflict, because Paul is a brilliant amazing guy."<ref name="Sumares"/> Murray also sought [[Alan Silvestri]]. According to Sumares Viacom did not want to use Silvestri as the organization wanted a band "slightly older kids could identify with."<ref name="Sumares"/>

==Plot==
{{Refimprovesect|date=December 2008}}
The plot follows the life of a [[wallaby]], [[Rocko]], who has immigrated to America from Australia. In America, he is faced with various problems and challenges involving his pals who try to teach him what it means to be a good friend.
Many of the locations in the television show ''Rocko's Modern Life'' have the letter "O" for example O-Town and Conglom-O. When asked about the use of "O" in his show Murray said,
{{quote|I always got a big kick out of the businesses that were 'House-O-Paint', or 'Ton-O-Noodles', because their names seemed to homogenize what they sold, and strip the products of true individuality and stress volume ... and we all know, the American dream is volume! So what better company to create volume than 'Conglom-O', and since a majority of the town worked at Conglom-O, it should be called 'O' Town. I also wanted the town to be 'anytown' USA, and I used to love sports players with a big ZERO on their back. It was funny to me.<ref name="TrainorMurray"/>}}

The plot locations included the following:

* O-Town is the town in which Rocko lives.
* Chokey Chicken is a favorite restaurant/hang-out place for Rocko, [[Heffer Wolfe|Heffer]], and [[Filburt]]. At some point during the fourth season the restaurant was renamed "Chewy Chicken" due to the former name referring to a euphemism for [[masturbation]] (i.e., "choking the chicken"), though earlier episodes continued to air with the "Chokey Chicken" name. It's a parody of [[KFC]].
* Conglom-O Corporation is the biggest company in town; it even runs City Hall. Mr. Dupette, who has very peculiar ways to see if the employees are fit to work there, manages Conglom-O. Conglom-O does not seem to have a specific purpose or product<U+2014>it is a giant company that manufactures many products. Conglom-O's slogan is always shown beneath its name. The slogan is "We own you," revealing in a later musical episode that they own everything in O-Town. When Ed Bighead was shown to work at Conglom-O in 1961, the slogan stated "We Will Own You" (alluding to the future of [[megacorporation]]s). The illustration that appears with the logo and on top of the official Conglom-O Corp. skyscraper is a [[martini glass]] with the [[earth]] in place of an [[olive]].
* [[Hell|Heck]] is where "bad people" go when they die. Run by Peaches, it is where Heffer is doomed to eternal suffering.
* Holl-o-Wood is a town that resembles the [[Hollywood]] section of [[Los Angeles]], [[California]].
* Kind of a Lot O' Comics is a [[comic book]] store where Rocko works. His boss, Mr. Smitty, is a cruel toad who only concentrates on selling comics. Rocko, however, is very nice and giving. For example, when a customer sneezed all over a comic, Rocko gave him a fresh copy and did not charge him for the previous comic.

==Marvel Comics series==
During [[Tom DeFalco]]'s Editor-in-Chief career, [[Marvel Comics]] produced a seven-issue [[comic book]] series based on the television series.<ref>
"[http://books.google.com/books?id=YfFeHAAACAAJ&dq=Rocko%27s+Modern+Life Rocko's Modern Life]" Information, ''[[Google Books]]''
</ref> Marvel published the series from June 1994 to December 1994 with monthly releases.

[[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon]] approached Marvel, asking the company to produce comic book series for ''Rocko's Modern Life'' and ''[[Ren and Stimpy]]''. Marvel purchased the license for Rocko from Nickelodeon. The staff created the comics, and Susan Luposniak, a Nickelodeon employee,<ref name="LetterToEditor3">
"That's Life," ''Rocko's Modern Life''. [[Marvel Comics]]. Volume 1, Issue 3.
</ref> examined the comics before they were released.<ref name="LetterstoEditor4">
"That's Life," ''Rocko's Modern Life''. [[Marvel Comics]]. Volume 1, Issue 4.
</ref> Joe Murray said in a December 2, 2008 blog entry that he drew some of the pages in the comic book series.<ref>
"[http://joemurraystudio.com/blog/?p=671 December 2, 2008]." ''Joe Murray Studio''. Retrieved December 4, 2008.</ref>

The comics contain stories not seen in the television show. In addition, the comic book series omits some television show characters and places, while some original places and characters appear in the comics. [[John Lewandowski|John "Lewie" Lewandowski]] wrote all of the stories except for one; [[Joey Cavalieri]] wrote "Beaten by a Club," the second story of Issue #4.

Troy Little, a resident of [[Monroe, Oregon]], wrote to Marvel requesting that the title for the comic's [[comic book letter column|letters column]] should be "That's Life." In Issue 3, published in August 1994, the editors decided to use the title for the comic's "Letters to the Editor" section.<ref name="LetterToEditor3"/><ref name="LetterstoEditor4"/> In Issue 5, published in October 1994, the editors stated that they still received suggestions for the title for the comic even though the editors had decided on using "That's Life" by Issue 3.<ref>
