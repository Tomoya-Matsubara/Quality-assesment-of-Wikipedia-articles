'''Olmec colossal heads''' are a distinctive feature of the [[Olmec]] civilization of ancient [[Mesoamerica]].<ref name="Diehl04p111">Diehl 2004, p.111.</ref> The first archaeological investigations of Olmec culture were carried out by [[Matthew Stirling]] at [[Tres Zapotes]] in 1938, spurred by the discovery of a colossal head there in the 19th century.<ref name="Diehl04p182"/> Seventeen confirmed examples of stone heads are known, all from within the [[Olmec heartland]] on the [[Gulf Coast of Mexico]], in the states of [[Veracruz]] and [[Tabasco]]. Most colossal heads were sculpted from spherical boulders but two from [[San Lorenzo Tenochtitl<U+00E1>n]] were recarved from massive stone thrones.<ref name="Diehl04p111"/> An additional monument, at [[Takalik Abaj]] in [[Guatemala]], is a throne that may have been carved from a colossal head.<ref name="Diehl04p146"/> This is the only known example outside the Olmec heartland.<ref name="Pool07p57">Pool 2007, p.57.</ref> 

Dating of the monuments has proven difficult due to the movement of many from their original context. Most of the heads have been dated to the Early Preclassic (1500<U+2013>1000&nbsp;BC) and some to the Middle Preclassic (1000<U+2013>400&nbsp;BC). The smallest examples weigh 6 tons, while the largest is variously estimated to weigh 40 to 50 tons, although this was abandoned unfinished near to the source of its stone.

Olmec colossal heads were sculpted from large basalt boulders quarried in the [[Sierra de los Tuxtlas]] mountains of Veracruz. They were transported over large distances, although the method used for transportation is not clear. Finished momuments represented lifelike portraits of individual Olmec rulers, each wearing a distinctive headdress, and heads were variously arranged in lines or groups at major Olmec centres.

All of the Olmec colossal heads depict mature men with fleshy cheeks, flat noses and eyes that tend to be slightly crossed. The general physical characteristics of the heads are of a type that is still common among people in Tabasco and Veracruz in modern times. The backs of the heads are often flat.

==Dating==
The colossal heads cannot be precisely dated but the San Lorenzo heads were buried by 900&nbsp;BC, indicating that their period of manufacture and use was earlier still. The heads from Tres Zapotes had been moved from their original context before they were investigated by archaeologists and the heads from La Venta were found partially exposed on the modern ground surface. Due to these factors, the period of production of the colossal heads is not known, nor whether it spanned a century or a millennium.<ref name="Diehl04p112"/> Estimates of the time span of head production vary from 50 years to 200 years.<ref>Diehl 2004, p.112. Pool 2007, p.118.</ref> The San Lorenzo heads are believed to be the oldest examples of the type and are the most skillfully executed.<ref name="delafuente96p4849">de la Fuente 1996a, pp.&nbsp;48<U+2013>49.</ref> All of the stone heads have been assigned to the Preclassic period of [[Mesoamerican chronology]], generally to the Early Preclassic (1500<U+2013>1000&nbsp;BC), although the two Tres Zapotes heads and the La Cobata Head are attributed to the Middle Preclassic (1000<U+2013>400&nbsp;BC).<ref>Pool 2007, pp.7, 117<U+2013>118, 251.</ref>

==Characteristics==
[[File:Cabeza Colosal n<U+00BA>1 del Museo Xalapa.jpg|thumb|right|San Lorenzo Colossal Head&nbsp;1]]
Olmec colossal heads vary in height from {{convert|1.47|to|3.4|m|ft}} and weigh between 6 and 50 tons.<ref name="Pool07p106">Pool 2007, p.106.</ref> All of the Olmec colossal heads depict mature men with flat noses and fleshy cheeks; the eyes tend to be slightly crossed. The general physical characteristics of the heads are of a type that is still common among people in the Olmec region in modern times. The backs of the heads are often flat, as if the monuments were originally placed against a wall.<ref name="Diehl04p111"/> All examples of Olmec colossal heads wear distinctive headdresses that probably represent cloth or animal hide originals.<ref>Diehl 2004, pp.&nbsp;111<U+2013>112.</ref> Some examples have a tied knot at the back of the head, and some are decorated with feathers. A head from [[La Venta]] is decorated with the head of a bird. There are similarities between the headdresses on some of the heads that has led to speculation that specific headdresses may represent different dynasties, or perhaps identify specific rulers. Most of the heads wear large [[Plug (jewellery)|earspools]] inserted into the ear lobes.<ref name="Diehl04p112">Diehl 2004,p.112.</ref>

All of the heads are notably realistic, and it is likely that they were portraits of living (or recently deceased) rulers who were well known to the sculptors.<ref name="Diehl04p112"/> Each head is distinct and naturalistic, displaying individualised features.<ref name="delafuente96p4849"/> They were once thought to represent [[Mesoamerican ballgame|ballplayers]] although this theory is no longer widely held; it is possible, however, that they represent rulers equipped for the Mesoamerican ballgame.<ref name="Diehl04p112"/> Expressions depicted on the heads vary from stern through placid to smiling.<ref name="Pool07p106"/>

In the late 19th century, Jos<U+00E9> Melgar y Serrano described a colossal head as having "Ethiopian" features and [[Olmec alternative origin speculations|African origin speculation]] resurfaced in 1960 in the work of Alfonso Medell<U+00ED>n Zenil and in the 1970s in the writings of [[Ivan van Sertima]].<ref>de la Fuente 1996a, p.48. Diehl 2004, pp.112, 194c5n6.</ref> Such speculation is not taken seriously by Mesoamerican scholars such as [[Richard Diehl]] and Ann Cyphers.<ref>Diehl 2004, p.112. Cyphers 1996, p.156.</ref>

Although all the colossal heads are broadly similar, there are distinct stylistic differences in their execution.<ref name="delafuente96p4849"/> One of the heads from San Lorenzo bears traces of plaster and red paint, suggesting that the heads were originally brightly decorated.<ref name="Diehl04p112"/> Heads did not just represent individual Olmec rulers, they also incorporated the very concept of rulership itself.<ref>Pool 2007, p.118.</ref>

==Manufacture==
[[File:La Venta Colossal Head 3.jpg|thumb|left|The unfinished La Venta Colossal Head&nbsp;3]]
The production of each colossal head must have been carefully planned to ensure that the necessary resources were available and it is likely that only the more powerful Olmec rulers were able to mobilise these resources. The workforce must have included sculptors, labourers, overseers, boatmen, woodworkers and other artesans producing the tools to make and move the monument, as well as all the support to feed and otherwise attend to these workers. The seaonal and agricultural cycles and river levels needed to have been taken into account to plan the production of the monument and the whole project may well have taken years from beginning to end.<ref>Diehl 2011, pp.193<U+2013>194.</ref>

All seventeen of the confirmed colossal heads in the Olmec heartland were sculpted from [[basalt]] mined in the Sierra de los Tuxtlas mountains of Veracruz.<ref name="Hammond01"/> Most are sculpted from a coarse grained dark grey basalt known as Cerro Cintepec basalt after a volcano in the range. Investigators have proposed that large Cerro Cintepec basalt boulders found on the southeastern slopes of the mountains are the source of the stone for the monuments.<ref name="Gillespie94p231">Gillespie 1994, p.231.</ref> These boulders are found in an area affected by large [[lahar]]s (volcanic mudslides) that carried substantial blocks of stone down the mountain slopes, which suggests that the Olmecs did not need to quarry the raw material for sculpting the heads.<ref>Killion and Urcid 2001, p.6.</ref> Boulders were carefully selected to mimic the shape of a human head.<ref name="Hammond01"/> The stone for the San Lorenzo and La Venta heads was transported a considerable distance from the source. The La Cobata head was found on El Vigia hill in the Sierra de los Tuxtlas and the stone from Tres Zapotes Colossal Head&nbsp;1 and Nestepe Colossal Head&nbsp;1 (also known as Tres Zapotes Monuments&nbsp;A and&nbsp;Q) came from the same hill.<ref name="Hammond01"/> Monument&nbsp;20 at San Lorenzo is an extensively damaged throne with a figure emerging from a niche. Its sides were broken away and it was dragged to another location before being abandoned. It is possible that this damage was caused by the initial stages of recarving the monument into a colossal head but that the work was never completed.<ref>Diehl 2004, p.119.</ref>

The huge boulders were transported over {{convert|150|km|mi}} from the source of the stone.<ref>Diehl 2000, p.164.</ref> The exact method of transportation of such large masses of rock are unknown, especially since the Olmecs lacked beasts of burden and functional wheels,<ref name="Diehl04p118">Diehl 2004, p.118.</ref> and they were likely to have used water transport whenever possible.<ref name="Hammond01"/> Two badly damaged Olmec sculptures depict rectangular stone blocks bound with ropes. A largely destroyed human figure rides upon each block, with their legs hanging over the side. Richard Diehl argues that these sculptures depict Olmec rulers overseeing the transport of the stone that would be fashioned into their monuments.<ref name="Diehl04p118"/> When transport over land was necessary, the Olmecs are likely to have used causeways, ramps and roads to facilitate moving the heads.<ref name="Diehl11p185">Diehl 2011, p.185.</ref>

The flat backs of many of the colossal heads represented the flat bases of the monumental thrones from which they were reworked. Only four of the seventeen heartland heads do not have flattened backs, indicating that the majority were probably reworked monuments. Alternatively, the flattened backs of many of the monuments may have eased the transport of these massive monuments. Two of the heads from San Lorenzo have traces of niches that are characteristic of monumental Olmec thrones and so were definitely reworked from earlier monuments.<ref name="Pool07p121">Pool 2007, p.121.</ref>

Archaeological investigation of Olmec basalt workshops suggest that the colossal heads were first roughly shaped using direct percussion to chip away both large and small flakes of stone. The sculpture was then refined by retouching the surface using [[hammerstone]]s, which were generally rounded cobbles that could be of the same basalt as the monument intself, although this was not always the case. Abrasives were found in association with workshops at San Lorenzo and indicates their use in the finishing of fine detail. Olmec colossal heads were fashioned as in-the-round monuments with varying levels of relief on the same work; they tended to feature higher relief on the face and lower relief on the earspools and headdresses.<ref name="Pool07p110">Pool 2007, p.110.</ref>

===San Lorenzo===
The ten colossal heads from San Lorenzo originally formed two roughly parallel lines running north-south across the site.<ref>Diehl 2004, p.35. Pool 2007, p.122.</ref> Although some were recovered from ravines,<ref name="Pool07p122">Pool 2007, p.122.</ref> they were found close to their original placements and had been buried by local erosion. These heads, together with a number of monumental stone thrones, probably formed a processional route across the site, powerfully displaying its dynastic history.<ref>Diehl 2004, p.35.</ref> Two of the San Lorenzo heads had been recarved from older thrones.<ref>Diehl 2004, p.37.</ref>

[[File:San Lorenzo Colossal Head 2, from Veracruz.jpg|thumb|left|San Lorenzo Colossal Head&nbsp;2 in the Museo Nacional de Antropolog<U+00ED>a in Mexico City]]
'''San Lorenzo Colossal Head&nbsp;1''' (also known as '''San Lorenzo Monument&nbsp;1''')<ref name="CasellasCa<U+00F1>ellas04p147">Casellas Ca<U+00F1>ellas 2004, p.147.</ref> was lying facing upwards when excavated. The erosion of a path passing on top of the monument uncovered its eye and led to the discovery of the Olmec site.<ref>Diehl 2004, plate VI.</ref> Colossal Head&nbsp;1 is {{convert|2.84|m|ft}} high;<ref>Coe and Koontz, 1962, 2002, p.4.</ref> it measures {{convert|2.11|m|ft}} wide and it weighs 25.3 tons. The monument was discovered partially buried at the edge of a gully by Matthew Stirling in 1945. When discovered it was lying on its back, looking upwards. It was associated with a large number of broken ceramic vessels and figurines.<ref name="CCp179"/> The majority of these ceramic remains have been dated to between 800 and 400 BC;<ref>Casellas Ca<U+00F1>ellas 2004, p.180. Pool 2007, p.7.</ref> some pieces have been dated to the Villa Alta phase (Late Classic c.AD 800<U+2013>1000).<ref>Casellas Ca<U+00F1>ellas 2004, p.180. Coe 1962, 2002, p.9.</ref> The headdress possesses a plain band that is tied at the back of the head. The upper portion of the headdress is decorated with a U-shaped motif.<ref name="CCp180"/> This element descends across the front of the headdress, terminating on the forehead. On the front portion it is decorated with five semicircular motifs.<ref>Casellas Ca<U+00F1>ellas 2004, pp.&nbsp;179<U+2013>180.</ref> The scalp piece does not meet the horizontal band, leaving a space between the two pieces. On each side of the face a strap descends from the headdress and passes in front of the ear.<ref name="CCp180">Casellas Ca<U+00F1>ellas 2004, p.180.</ref> The forehead is wrinkled in a frown. The lips are slightly parted without revealing the teeth. The cheeks are pronounced and the ears are particularly well executed.<ref name="CCp181">Casellas Ca<U+00F1>ellas 2004, p.181.</ref> The face is slightly asymmetric, which may be due to error on the part of the sculptors or may accurately reflect the physical features of the portrait's subject.<ref name="CCp182">Casellas Ca<U+00F1>ellas 2004, p.182.</ref> The head has been moved to the Museo de Antropolog<U+00ED>a de Xalapa ("Anthropological Museum of Xalapa").<ref name="CCp179">Casellas Ca<U+00F1>ellas 2004, p.179.</ref>

'''San Lorenzo Colossal Head&nbsp;2''' (also known as '''San Lorenzo Monument&nbsp;2''')<ref name="CasellasCa<U+00F1>ellas04p147"/> was reworked from a monumental throne.<ref name="Pool07p121"/> The head stands {{convert|2.69|m|ft}} high and measures {{convert|1.83|m|ft}} wide by {{convert|1.05|m|ft}} deep. The head weighs 20 tons. Colossal Head&nbsp;2 was discovered in 1945 when Matthew Stirling's guide cleared away some of the vegetation and mud that covered it.<ref name="CCp183">Casellas Ca<U+00F1>ellas 2004, p.183.</ref> The monument was found lying on its back, facing the sky, and was excavated in 1946 by Stirling and [[Philip Drucker]]. In 1962 the monument was removed from the San Lorenzo plateau in order to put it on display as part of "The Olmec tradition" exhibition at the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Houston|Museum of Fine Arts]] in [[Houston]] in 1963.<ref>Casellas Ca<U+00F1>ellas 2004, p.184.

Pool 2007, p.7. Coe 1962, 2002, p.9.</ref> Colossal Head&nbsp;2 wears a complex headdress that sports a horizontal band tied at the back of the head; this is decorated with three bird's heads that are located above the forehead and temples.<ref>Casellas Ca<U+00F1>ellas 2004, pp.&nbsp;184<U+2013>185.</ref> The scalp piece is formed from six strips running towards the back of the head. The front of the headdress above the horizontal band is plain. Two short straps hang down from the headdress in front of the ears. The ear jewellery is formed by large squared hoops or framed discs. The left and right ornaments are different, with radial lines on the left earflare, a feature absent on the right earflare.<ref>Casellas Ca<U+00F1>ellas 2004, pp.&nbsp;185<U+2013>186.</ref> The head is badly damaged due to an unfinished reworking process.<ref name="CCp186"/> This process has pitmarked the entire face with at least 60 smaller hollows and 2 larger holes.<ref name="CCp188">Casellas Ca<U+00F1>ellas 2004, p.188.</ref> The surviving features appear to depict an ageing man with the forehead creased into a frown. The lips are thick and slightly parted to reveal the teeth; the head has a pronounced chin.<ref name="CCp186">Casellas Ca<U+00F1>ellas 2004, p.186.</ref>

[[File:San Lorenzo Monument 3 crop.jpg|thumb|right|San Lorenzo Colossal Head&nbsp;3]]
'''San Lorenzo Colossal Head&nbsp;3''' is also known as '''San Lorenzo Monument&nbsp;3'''.<ref name="CasellasCa<U+00F1>ellas04p147"/> The head measures {{convert|1.78|m|ft}} high by {{convert|1.63|m|ft}} wide by {{convert|0.95|m|ft}} deep. San Lorenzo Head&nbsp;3 weighs 9.4 tons. The head was discovered in a deep gully by Matthew Stirling in 1946. The monument was found lying face down and its excavation was difficult due to the wet conditions in the gully.<ref name="CCp189"/> Although the monument was found {{Convert|0.8|km|mi}} southwest of the main mound at San Lorenzo, its original location is unknown; erosion of the gully may have resulted in significant movement of the sculpture.<ref>Casellas Ca<U+00F1>ellas 2004, pp.&nbsp;189<U+2013>190.</ref> Head&nbsp;3 has been moved to the [[Museo de Antropolog<U+00ED>a de Xalapa]] ("Xalapa Anthropological Museum").<ref name="CCp189">Casellas Ca<U+00F1>ellas 2004, p.189.</ref> The headdress is complex, with the horizontal basal band being formed by four horizontal cords, with diagonal folds above each eye. A small skullcap tops the headdress. A large flap formed of four cords drops down both sides of the head, completely covering the ears.<ref name="CCp190">Casellas Ca<U+00F1>ellas 2004, p.190.</ref> The face has a typically frowning brow and, unusually, has clearly defined eyelids. The lips are thick and slightly parted. The front of the lower lip has broken away completely,<ref name="CCp191">Casellas Ca<U+00F1>ellas 2004, p.191.</ref> and the lower front of the headdress is pitted with 27 irregularly spaced artificial depressions.<ref name="CCp192">Casellas Ca<U+00F1>ellas 2004, p.192.</ref>

'''San Lorenzo Colossal Head&nbsp;4''' (also known as '''San Lorenzo Monument&nbsp;4''')<ref name="CasellasCa<U+00F1>ellas04p147"/> has been moved to the Museo de Antropolog<U+00ED>a de Xalapa.<ref>Cyphers 2007, p.38.</ref> Colossal Head&nbsp;4 is {{convert|1.78|m|ft}} high,<ref name="CoeKoontz6202p69">Coe and Koontz, 1962, 2002, p. 69.</ref> {{convert|1.17|m|ft}} wide and {{convert|0.95|m|ft}} deep.<ref name="CCp192"/> The head was discovered by Matthew Stirling in 1946, {{convert|550|m|yd}} northwest of the principal mound, at the edge of a gully. When excavated, it was found to be lying on its right-hand side and in a very good state of preservation.<ref name="CCp192"/> The head weighs 6 tons and was moved to the Museo de Antropolog<U+00ED>a de Xalapa.<ref name="Cyphers96p156">Cyphers 1996, p. 156.</ref> Ceramic materials excavated with the head became mixed with ceramics associated with Head&nbsp;5, making ceramic dating of the monument difficult. The headdress is decorated with a horizontal band formed of four sculpted cords, similar to those of Head&nbsp;3. On the right-hand side, three tassels descend from the upper portion of the headdress; they terminate in a total of eight strips that hang down across the horizontal band. These tassels are judged to represent hair rather than cords.<ref name="CCp193">Casellas Ca<U+00F1>ellas 2004, p. 193.</ref> Also on the right hand side, two cords descend across the ear and continue to the base of the monument.<ref>Casellas Ca<U+00F1>ellas 2004, pp.&nbsp;193<U+2013>194.</ref> On the left-hand side, three vertical cords descend across the ear. The earflare is only visible of the right hand side; it is formed of a plain disc and peg. The face is that of an ageing man with a creased forehead, low cheekbones and a prominent chin. The lips are thick and slightly parted.<ref name="CCp194">Casellas Ca<U+00F1>ellas 2004, p. 194.</ref>

'''San Lorenzo Colossal Head&nbsp;6''' (also known as '''San Lorenzo Monument&nbsp;17''')<ref name="CasellasCa<U+00F1>ellas04p147"/> is one of the smaller examples of colossal heads, standing {{convert|1.67|m|ft}}.<ref name="CoeKoontz6202p69"/> It measures {{convert|1.41|m|ft}} wide by {{convert|1.26|m|ft}} deep and is estimated to weigh between 8 and 10 tons. The head was discovered by a local farmworker and was excavated in 1965 by Luis Aveleyra and [[Rom<U+00E1>n Pi<U+00F1>a Chan]]. The head had collapsed into a ravine under its own weight and was found face down on its left hand side. In 1970 it was transported to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in [[New York]] for the museum's centenary exhibition. After its return to Mexico, it was placed in the Museo Nacional de Antropolog<U+00ED>a in Mexico City.<ref name="CCp200"/> It is sculpted with a net-like head covering joined together with sculpted beads.<ref>Diehl 2004, p. 93.</ref> A covering descends from under the headdress to cover back half of the neck.<ref name="CCp201">Casellas Ca<U+00F1>ellas 2004, p. 201.</ref> The headband is divided into four strips and begins above the right ear, extending around the entire head. A short strap descends from either side of the head to the ear. The ear ornaments are complex and are larger at the front of the ear than at the back. The face is that of an ageing male with the forehead creased in a frown, wrinkles under the eyes, sagging cheeks and deep creases on either side of the nose. The face is somewhat asymmetric, possibly due to errors in the execution of the monument.<ref>Casellas Ca<U+00F1>ellas 2004, pp.&nbsp;202<U+2013>203.</ref>

===La Venta===
[[File:Olmec warrior.jpg|thumb|right|La Venta Monument&nbsp;1 from the side, displaying the headdress straps and ear ornaments]]
Three of the La Venta heads were found in a line running east-west in the northern Complex&nbsp;I; all three faced northwards, away from the city centre.<ref>Diehl 2004, pp.&nbsp;62<U+2013>63.</ref> The other head was found in Complex&nbsp;B to the south of the Great Pyramid, in a plaza that included a number of other sculptures.<ref>Diehl 2004, p.66.</ref> The latter, the first of the La Venta heads to be discovered, was found during archaeological exploration of La Venta in 1925; the other three remained unknown to archaeologists until a local boy guided Matthew Stirling to them while he was excavating the first head in 1940. They were located approximately {{convert|0.9|km|mi}} to the north of Monument&nbsp;1.<ref>Casellas Ca<U+00F1>ellas 2004, pp.163, 168.</ref>

'''La Venta Monument&nbsp;1''' is speculated to have been the portrait of La Venta's final ruler.<ref>Diehl 2004, plate V.</ref> Monument&nbsp;1 measures {{convert|2.41|m|ft}} high by {{convert|2.08|m|ft}} wide by {{convert|1.95|m|ft}} deep; it weighs 24 tons.<ref name="CCp163"/> The front of the headdress is decorated with three motifs that apparently represent the claws or fangs of an animal. Above these symbols is an angular U-shaped decoration descending from the scalp. On each side of the monument a strap descends from the headdress, passing in front of the ear. Each ear has a prominent ear ornament that descends from the earlobe to the base of the monument. The features are those of a mature man, with wrinkles around the mouth, eyes and nose.<ref name="CCp164"/> Monument&nbsp;1 is the best preserved head at La Venta but has suffered from erosion, particularly at the back.<ref name="CCp166">Casellas Ca<U+00F1>ellas 2004, p.166.</ref> The head was first described by [[Franz Blom]] and [[Oliver La Farge]] who investigated the La Venta remains on behalf of [[Tulane University]] in 1925. When discovered it was half-buried; its massive size meant that the discoverers were unable to excavate it completely. Matthew Stirling fully excavated the monument in 1940, after clearing the thick vegetation that had covered it in the intervening years. Monument&nbsp;1 has been moved to the [[Parque Museo La Venta]] in [[Villahermosa]].<ref name="CCp163">Casellas Ca<U+00F1>ellas 2004, p.163.</ref> The head was found in its original context; associated finds have been [[radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon dated]] to between 1000 and 600&nbsp;BC.<ref name="CCp164">Casellas Ca<U+00F1>ellas 2004, p.164.</ref>

'''La Venta Monument&nbsp;2''' measures {{convert|1.63|m|ft}} high by {{convert|1.35|m|ft}} wide by {{convert|0.98|m|ft}} deep; the head weighs 11.8 tons.<ref name="CCp164"/> The face has a broadly smiling expression that reveals four of the upper teeth. The cheeks are given prominence by the action of smiling; the brow that is normally visible in other heads is covered by the rim of the headdress.<ref name="CCp169">Casellas Ca<U+00F1>ellas 2004, p.169.</ref> The face is badly eroded, distorting the features.<ref name="CCp170">Casellas Ca<U+00F1>ellas 2004, p.170.</ref> In addition to the severe erosion damage, the upper lip and a part of the nose have been deliberately mutilated.<ref name="CCp171">Casellas Ca<U+00F1>ellas 2004, p.171.</ref> The head was found in its original context a few metres north of the northwest corner of pyramid-platform A-2. Radiocarbon dating of the monument's context dates it to between 1000 and 600&nbsp;BC. Monument&nbsp;2 has suffered erosion damage from its exposure to the elements prior to discovery. The head has a prominent headdress but this is badly eroded and any individual detail has been erased. A strap descends in front of the ear on each side of the head, descending as far as the earlobe. The head is adorned with ear ornaments in the form of a disc that covers the earlobe, with an associated clip or peg.<ref name="CCp168"/> The surviving details of the headdress and earflares are stylistically similar to those of Tres Zapotes Monument&nbsp;A.<ref>Casellas Ca<U+00F1>ellas 2004, pp.&nbsp;168<U+2013>169.</ref> The head has been moved to the [[Museo del Estado de Tabasco]] ("Tabasco State Museum") in Villahermosa.<ref name="CCp168">Casellas Ca<U+00F1>ellas 2004, p.168.</ref>

[[File:Olmec2.jpg|thumb|left|La Venta Monument&nbsp;2]]
'''La Venta Monument&nbsp;3''' stands {{convert|1.98|m|ft}} high and measures {{convert|1.6|m|ft}} wide by {{convert|1|m|ft}} deep. It weighs 12.8 tons. Monument&nbsp;3 was located a few metres to the east of Monument&nbsp;2. The head has been moved to the Parque Museo La Venta in Villahermosa. Like the other La Venta heads, its context has been radiocarbon dated to between 1000 and 600&nbsp;BC.<ref name="CCp172">Casellas Ca<U+00F1>ellas 2004, p.172.</ref> The head appears never to have been finished and has suffered severe erosion damage; both of these factors make its analysis difficult. It had a large headdress that descended to the eyebrows but all detail has been lost to weathering. Straps descend in front of each ear and continue to the base of the monument. The ears are wearing large flattened rings that overlap the straps; they probably represent jade ornaments of a type that have been recovered in the Olmec region. Although most of the facial detail is lost, the crinkling of the bridge of the nose is still evident, a feature that is common to the frowning expressions of the other Olmec colossal heads.<ref name="CCp173">Casellas Ca<U+00F1>ellas 2004, p.173.</ref>

'''La Venta Monument&nbsp;4''' measures {{convert|2.26|m|ft}} high by {{convert|1.98|m|ft}} wide and {{convert|1.86|m|ft}} deep. It weighs 19.8 tons. It was found a few metres to the west of Monument&nbsp;2 and has been moved to the Parque Museo La Venta.<ref name="CCp175">Casellas Ca<U+00F1>ellas 2004, p.175.</ref> As with the other heads in the group, its archaeological context has been radiocarbon dated to between 1000 and 600 BC.The headress is elaborate and, although damaged, various details are still discernable. The base of the headress is formed by three horizontal strips running over the forehead. One side is decorated with a double-disc motif that may have been repeated on the other; if so, damage to the right side has obliterated any trace of it.<ref name="CCp176">Casellas Ca<U+00F1>ellas 2004, p.176.</ref>  The top of the headdress is decorated with the clawed foot of a bird of prey.<ref>Pool 2007, p.166. Casellas Ca<U+00F1>ellas 2004, p.176.</ref> Either straps or plaits of hair descend on either side of the face, from the headdress to the base of the monument. Only one earspool survives, it is flat, in the form of a rounded square, and is decorated with a cross motif.<ref name="CCp176"/> The ears have been completely eroded away and the lips are damaged.<ref>Casellas Ca<U+00F1>ellas 2004, pp.&nbsp;177<U+2013>178.</ref> The surviving features display a frown and creasing around the nose and cheeks.<ref name="CCp177">Casellas Ca<U+00F1>ellas 2004, p.177.</ref> The head displays prominent teeth.<ref name="Pool07p166">Pool 2007, p.166.</ref>

===Tres Zapotes===
[[File:Tres Zapotes Monument A.jpg|thumb|right|Monument&nbsp;A from Tres Zapotes]]
The two colossal heads found at Tres Zapotes are stylistically distinct from the rest of the Olmec heads. Beatriz de la Fuente views them as a late regional survival of an older tradition while other scholars argue that they are merely the kind of regional variant to be expected in a frontier settlement.<ref>Diehl 2004, p.46.</ref> The two heads are the earliest known stone monuments from Tres Zapotes.<ref name="Pool07p250">Pool 2007, p.250.</ref>

'''Tres Zapotes Monument&nbsp;A''' (also known as '''Tres Zapotes Colossal Head&nbsp;1''') was discovered by accident in the middle of the 19th century,<ref name="Diehl04p182">Diehl 2004, p.182.</ref> {{convert|1|km|mi}} to the north of the modern village of Tres Zapotes.<ref name="CC04p152"/> It was excavated by Matthew Stirling in 1939 and stands {{convert|1.47|m|ft}} tall.<ref name="Diehl04p14"/> The monument is {{convert|1.5|m|ft}} wide by {{convert|1.45|m|ft}} deep.<ref name="CC04p151">Casellas Ca<U+00F1>ellas 2004, p.151.</ref> It is estimated to weigh 7.8 tons.<ref name="Diehl04p14">Diehl 2004, p.14.</ref> The head is sculpted with a simple headress with a wide band that is otherwise unadorned, and wears rectangular ear ornaments that project forwards onto the cheeks. The face is carved with deep creases between the cheeks and the nose and around the mouth; the forehead is creased into a frown.<ref name="CC04p152"/> The upper lip has suffered recent damage, with the left portion flaking away.<ref name="CC04p155">Casellas Ca<U+00F1>ellas 2004, p.155.</ref> Monument&nbsp;A was the first colossal head ever found, in the middle of the 19th century.<ref name="CC04p151"/> After its discovery it remained half-buried until it was excavated by Matthew Stirling in the late 1930s. At some point it was moved to the plaza of the modern village, probably in the early 1960s. It has since been moved to the [[Museo Comunitario de Tres Zapotes]].<ref name="CC04p152">Casellas Ca<U+00F1>ellas 2004, p.152.</ref>

'''Tres Zapotes Monument&nbsp;Q''' (also known as the '''Nestape Head''' and '''Tres Zapotes Colossal Head&nbsp;2''') measures {{convert|1.45|m|ft}} high by {{convert|1.34|m|ft}} wide and {{convert|1.26|m|ft}} deep. It weighs 8.5 tons. Its exact date of discovery is unknown but is estimated to have been some time in the 1940s, when it was struck by machinery being used to clear vegetation from Nestape hill.<ref name="CC04p155"/> Monument&nbsp;Q was the eleventh colossal head to be discovered. It was moved to the plaza of Santiago Tuxtla in 1951 and remains there to this day.<ref name="CC04p156">Casellas Ca<U+00F1>ellas 2004, p.156.</ref> The headdress is decorated with a frontal tongue-shaped ornament, and the back of the head is sculpted with seven plaits of hair bound with tassels. A strap descends from each side of the headdress, passing over the ears and to the base of the monument. The face has pronounced creases around the nose, mouth and eyes.<ref name="CC04p157">Casellas Ca<U+00F1>ellas 2004, p.157.</ref>

===La Cobata===
The La Cobata region was the source of the basalt used for carving all of the colossal heads in the Olmec heartland.<ref name="Hammond01">Hammond 2001.</ref> The La Cobata colossal head was discovered in 1970 and was the fifteenth to be recorded.<ref name="Hammond01"/> It was discovered in a mountain pass in the Sierra de los Tuxtlas, on the north side of El Vigia volcano near to [[Santiago Tuxtla]].<ref>Hammond 2001. Pool 2007, pp.56, 251.</ref> The head was largely buried when found; excavations uncovered a Late Classic (c. AD 600<U+2013>900) offering associated with the head consisting of a ceramic vessel and a {{convert|12|cm|in|adj=on}} long [[obsidian use in Mesoamerica|obsidian]] knife place pointing northwards towards the head. The offering is believed to have been deposited long after the head was sculpted.<ref>Casellas Ca<U+00F1>ellas 2004, p.160.</ref> The La Cobata Head has been moved from its original location to the main plaza at Santiago.<ref name="Hammond01"/>

The Cobata head more-or-less rounded and measures {{convert|3|by|3|m|ft}} by {{convert|3.4|m|ft}} high, making it the largest known head.<ref name="Hammond01"/> This massive sculpture is estimated to weigh 40 tons.<ref>Pool 2007, p.56.</ref> It is stylistically distinct from the other examples, and Beatriz de la Fuente placed it late in the Olmec time frame. [[Norman Hammond]] argues that the apparent stylistic differences of the monument stem from its unfinished state rather than its late production. The eyes of the monument are closed, the nose is flattened and lacks nostrils and the mouth was not sculpted in a realistic manner. The headdress is in the form of a plain horizontal band. The characteristics of the sculpture have led to some investigators suggesting that it represents a deceased person. It is possible, however, that the unusual facial features of the monument are due to it never having been finished.<ref name="Hammond01"/>

The original location of the La Cobata head was not a major archaeological site and it is likely that the head was either abandoned at its source or during transport to its intended destination. Various features of the head suggest that it was unfinished, such as a lack of symmetry below the mouth and an area of rough stone above the base. Rock was not removed from around the earspools as on other heads, and does not narrow towards the base. Large parts of the monument seem to be roughed out without finished detail. The right hand earspool also appears incomplete; the forward portion is marked with a sculpted line while the rear portion has been sculpted in relief, probably indicating that the right cheek and eye area were also unfinished. The La Cobata head was almost certainly carved from a raw boulder rather than being sculpted from a throne.<ref name="Hammond01"/>

===Takalik Abaj===
[[File:Takalik Abaj Olmec sculpture 1.JPG|thumb|right|Takalik Abaj Monument&nbsp;23 was possibly the only Olmec head outside of the Olmec heartland and was reworked into a throne.]]
Takalik Abaj was an important city in the foothills of the Guatemalan Pacific coast,<ref name="Diehl04p146"/> in the modern [[Departments of Guatemala|department]] of [[Retalhuleu]].<ref>Kelly 1996, p.210.</ref> Takalik Abaj Monument&nbsp;23 dates to the [[Mesoamerican chronology#Preclassic Era|Middle Preclassic]] period.<ref>Sharer and Traxler 2006, p.239.</ref> It appears that it was an Olmec-style colossal head that was recarved into a niche figure sculpture.<ref name="Diehl04p146">Diehl 2004, p.146.</ref> If this was originally a colossal head then it would be the only example known from outside the Olmec heartland.<ref name="Pool07p57"/>
