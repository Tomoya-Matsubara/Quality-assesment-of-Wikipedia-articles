==Biography ==
Paulos Faraj Rahho was born in 1942 in [[Mosul]]. He spent nearly all his life in Mosul, a city with one of the largest and oldest Christian populations in Iraq. In 1954 he entered the St. Peter's junior and major [[seminary]] in [[Baghdad]] in order to become a priest. After his ordination on June 10, 1965 he briefly worked in Baghdad before being appointed to St. Isaiah's Church in Mosul.<ref name="timesobit"/> Between [[1974]] and [[1976]], Rahho completed his religious studies in [[Rome]]. Rahho later founded the church of the Sacred Heart in [[Tel Keppe]], a town some 20 kilometers north of Mosul. "He also opened an orphanage for handicapped children".<ref name="timesobit"/> 

=== Archbishop of Mosul ===
In 2001, Pope [[John Paul II]] appointed him archbishop of the [[Chaldean Catholic Archeparchy of Mosul|Archeparchy of Mosul]]. On February 16, 2001, he was [[Holy Orders|ordained]] Chaldean Archbishop of Mosul, giving him responsibility for around 20,000 Catholics in ten parishes.<ref name="timesobit"/> He was ordained by the [[List of Chaldean Catholic Patriarchs of Babylon|Patriarch of Babylon]]. His church is known in Mosul as Safina (The Ship), but parishioners called it the Holy Spirit Church.<ref name="nytimes080314">[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/14/world/middleeast/14iraq.html?ref=world Kidnapped Iraqi Archbishop Is Dead], The New York Times, March 14, 2008.</ref>

===Unease with Sharia ===
Rahho expressed disquiet at the moves to incorporate [[Sharia law]] more fundamentally into the [[Constitution of Iraq|Iraqi constitution]], and continued throughout his life to lead worship in difficult situations.<ref name="timesobit"/> During his 2007 trip to Rome, with the patriarch of Babylon [[Emmanuel III Delly]] who was then appointed cardinal, Rahho confided that he had been threatened by gunmen in his native town.<ref name="timesobit"/> Following the start of the Iraq war, [[persecution of Christians]] in Iraq increased dramatically.<ref name="Allbritton">{{citation|last=Allbritton|first=Christopher|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,699409,00.html|title=Iraq's Persecuted Christians|publisher=Time|date=2004-09-20}}</ref>  Rahho commented on the precarious situation of Mesopotamian Christians in an interview with Asia News shortly before his kidnapping.<ref name="timesobit"/>

==Kidnapping and death==
Late on February 29, 2008, according to a report given by the [[Catholic News Service]], Archbishop Rahho was [[wikt:kidnapped|kidnapped]] from his car in the Al-Nur district of the city; his bodyguards and driver were killed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0801165.htm|title=Kidnappers take Iraqi Archbishop, Kill his three companions|accessdate=2008-03-14 |publisher=Catholic News Service}}</ref>  According to church officials, "gunmen sprayed the Archbishop's car with bullets, killed two bodyguards and shoved the bishop into the trunk of a car. In the darkness, he managed to pull out his cellphone and call the church, telling officials not to pay a ransom for his release, they said. "He believed that this money would not be paid for good works and would be used for killing and more evil actions," the officials said".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/14/world/middleeast/14iraq.html?ref=world|title=Kidnapped Iraqi Archbishop Is Dead|accessdate=2008-03-14|publisher=The New York Times}}</ref> Other reports stated that also investigators believed the archbishop may have been shot at the time of the kidnapping.<ref name="CNN">{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/meast/03/13/iraq.main/index.html|title=Source: U.S. sent severed fingers of Iraq kidnap victims|accessdate=2008-03-13|publisher=CNN}}{{Dead link|date=April 2009}}</ref>
