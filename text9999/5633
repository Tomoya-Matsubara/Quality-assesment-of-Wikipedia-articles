'''Canada's Wonderland''' (often referred to locally as '''Wonderland''') is a {{convert|330|acre|sqkm|sing=on}} [[amusement park|theme park]] located in [[Vaughan, Ontario]], [[Canada]], 30 kilometres north of downtown [[Toronto, Ontario]]. It is considered one of North America's premier amusement parks, with more than 200 attractions. The park is open seasonally from May to October. While under [[Paramount Pictures]] (later bought by [[Viacom (1971-2005)|Viacom]]) ownership from 1994 until 2006, the park was known as '''Paramount Canada's Wonderland''' until it was sold to [[Cedar Fair Entertainment Company|Cedar Fair]] and reverted to its original name.  The park has also been the most attended seasonal theme park in North America for two years running (2005 and 2006).<ref name="Canada's Wonderland Attendance Record">{{cite web

== Park history ==
===Early History===
In 1972, the [[Taft Broadcasting]] Company first proposed building a 1.50 km<U+00B2> (330 [[acre]]) theme park in the small village of [[Maple, Ontario|Maple]], now part of Vaughan, Ontario. Several other possible locations were considered, including [[Niagara Falls, Ontario]], [[Cambridge, Ontario]] and [[Milton, Ontario]], but the site in Maple was finally selected because of its proximity to the City of [[Toronto]] and the [[400-series highways (Ontario)|400-series of highways]].

Other companies had seriously considered the [[Greater Toronto Area]] as a spot to build a theme park, including the Conklin family (whose [[Conklin Shows]] ran various midways around North America, including Toronto's C.N.E. midway) and [[Walt Disney]] who considered the area prior to his expansion plans in Florida. He eventually decided that the area would not make a suitable park site, the main reason being that the climate was too cold, thus the operating season would be too short to be sustainable.

Construction of the park was opposed on multiple fronts. Many cultural institutions in Toronto such as [[Ontario Place]], the [[Royal Ontario Museum]] and the operators of the [[Canadian National Exhibition]] (CNE) felt that the new theme park would put them out of business because the Toronto market was not large enough to support more competition. Other groups that fought the building of Wonderland included a Vaughan residential association (called 'SAVE') who felt the increased traffic would reduce property values. Some of the concessions from the company included a landscaped berm around the park to reduce noise and the appearance of the large parking lot. Taft was concerned about opposition, going as far as to fly a group of opponents and regional councilors out to [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati]] to show residents and town councilors the positive impact of one of their theme parks within the local community (it should be noted that up until the 1970s, amusement parks had the reputation of being poorly designed and 'unsavory'){{Fact|date=February 2007}}. People in the region were concerned that the new park would be similar in aesthetics to a [[carnival]] or midway.

Canada's Wonderland was also responsible for changing the master development plan for the Province of Ontario. The government wanted to increase residential and commercial development to the east of Toronto in the [[Regional Municipality of Durham]], which includes [[Pickering, Ontario|Pickering]] and [[Oshawa, Ontario|Oshawa]], while having the lands to the north of Toronto remain agricultural (see [[Greenbelt (Golden Horseshoe)]]). Wonderland was able to convince the province to amend the planning policy for the region, and the park secured infrastructure improvements (including a highway overpass and sewage systems) to be expanded and built out to the site. These improvements paved the way for increased development throughout the region.

Concerns were also raised about the cultural implications of allowing an American theme park to open in Canada. Many felt that it would be a "[[Trojan Horse]]" for [[American culture]]. To offset the criticism, Taft planned to open '''Frontier Canada''', a part of the park devoted to Canada's history. Early park maps show the area encompassing what is now Splashworks, White Water Canyon, the Paramount F/X Theatre and the southern part of Kidzville, as well as proposed attractions, including a steam passenger train. While '''Frontier Canada''' was never built, several elemental themes remain in the area. Unlike its sister parks, [[Kings Island]] and [[Kings Dominion]], it was decided during the early planning stages that centre piece of the park would not be a replica of [[Paris, France]]'s famous [[Eiffel Tower]]. Instead the parks designers chose to build a massive mountain, known as Wonder Mountain. Situated at the top of International Street, Wonder Mountain featured a huge waterfall and interior pathways which led visitors to a look-out point. Other elements which were never built include a hotel and conference centre (to have been built north of the park).

On June 13, 1979, Ontario Premier [[Bill Davis|William Davis]] depressed the plunger on an electronic detonating device, triggering an explosion on the site. Construction on Canada<U+2019>s Wonderland began immediately and continued through to early 1981. Canadian companies partnered on the preliminary design and engineering of the project and helped to mould the dream into a reality.

Two years later, on [[May 23]], [[1981]], Canada's Wonderland was officially opened to the public by then [[Premier of Ontario]] William Davis and Taft Broadcasting President Dudley Taft. The spectacular opening ceremony included 10,000 [[helium]] [[balloon]]s, 13 [[parachuting|parachutists]], 350 white [[dove]]s, and a [[pipe band]]. Four children representing the [[Arctic]], [[Pacific]], [[Atlantic]], and [[Great Lakes]] regions of Canada each poured a vial of water from their home regions into the park's spectacular fountain. Hockey superstar [[Wayne Gretzky]] also appeared as a special guest, helping to raise the [[Canadian flag]]. 12,000 guests were welcomed into the park for the first time.

===Recent history===
The park's former connection to [[Hanna-Barbera]] productions was reduced after [[Paramount Pictures]] purchased the park. At that point the park was renamed Paramount Canada's Wonderland. After [[Viacom (1971-2005)|Viacom]] bought Paramount in 1994, a successful attempt was made to bring families back to the park by providing children with [[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon]] cartoon characters that were familiar to a new generation. While the Nickelodeon channel (part of Viacom's [[MTV Networks]]) is not available in Canada, many of the network's shows air on [[YTV (Canadian television)|YTV]], making this decision logical. YTV had previously been involved in numerous projects at the park, including the 1992 direct-to-video ''Festival of Friends'' concert, raising money for [[Kids Help Phone]].

In 2005 the park introduced Fearfest, renamed Halloween Haunt in July 2007. Halloween Haunt is a Halloween event featuring various haunted house attractions in different themed areas of the park. The park continues running many of their thrill rides during the event, but the section of the park for smaller children is closed off. [[Thunder Run]], where patrons ride a mine car like train through a mountain, is also themed for the event. During Halloween Haunt it is called Haunted Thunder Run, and patrons ride through a darker tunnel with more strobe lights, fog machines, and black light lit scenes featuring the skeletons of miners that might have died in the mine. In 2006, the park introduced Spooktacular, a Halloween event geared towards children. The event included children's rides, costume contests and a treasure hunt. Spooktacular was open on weekends during the daytime, while Fearfest remained open at night. Due to very low attendance, Spooktacular only lasted one season.

On [[14 May]] [[2006]], it was announced that [[Cedar Fair Entertainment Co.]] was interested in acquiring the five [[Paramount Parks|Paramount theme parks]], including Canada's Wonderland. The acquisition was completed on [[30 June]] 2006.<ref name="Cedar Fair sale">{{cite web
|url=http://www3.paramountparks.com/CanadasWonderland/news/detail.cfm?item_id=387
|title=Sale of Paramount Parks to Cedar Fair, L.P.
}}</ref> As a result, in early January 2007, Cedar Fair began to drop the "Paramount" name from all of their former Paramount parks, and the park is currently referred to once again by its original name, "Canada's Wonderland". The 2007 season marked a transition year of removing "all things Paramount" throughout the park. By the start of the 2008 season, the Paramount logo and similar references will be removed.

In June 2007, an accident involving a thirteen-year-old girl at a theme park in Kentucky on a ride similar to the Drop Zone at Canada's Wonderland caused Cedar Fair to close all five similar rides in its theme parks. Drop Zone at Canada's Wonderland was reopened in July 2007.{{Fact|date=February 2008}}

In August 2007, Cedar Fair announced that Fearfest would be renamed Halloween Haunt to remain consistent with other Cedar Fair parks. At this time Cedar Fair also announced that Spooktacular would be discontinued. In place of Spooktacular, the park extended its regular operating season until the last weekend in October. Thus, the park is open to the public during the day, and Halloween Haunt runs in the late evenings on October weekends. The park also announced its addition for 2008, a new [[hypercoaster]] called [[Behemoth (roller coaster)|Behemoth]], which will be the largest roller coaster in Canada, and will open in May 2008.<ref>{{cite web

==Attractions==
Today, Canada's Wonderland has over 200 attractions, including over 60 thrill rides. The park has North America's third most [[roller coasters]] with 14 in total, and North America's greatest variety. The park features eight themed areas on 330 acres (1.3 km<U+00B2>) of land which includes a 20 acre (81,000 m<U+00B2>) waterpark called Splash Works. Splash Works has over 2 million <!--US or imperial?--> gallons (7,570 m<U+00B3>) of heated water, Canada's largest outdoor [[wave pool]] measuring 36,000 square feet (3,300 m<U+00B2>), a lazy river, and 16 water slides.

[[Image:Topgunpic2.jpg|thumb|[[Flight Deck (Canada's Wonderland)|Flight Deck]] in action]]

In 1983, Canada's Wonderland added the Kingswood Music Theatre, a 15,000 seat amphitheatre that hosted many "big-name" concerts. After the [[Molson Amphitheatre]] opened on the grounds of Ontario Place in 1995, cultural festivals at the theatre became more prominent.

==Location==
Canada's Wonderland is on the east side of [[Highway 400 (Ontario)|Highway 400]] between Rutherford Road (Exit 33) and Major Mackenzie Drive (Exit 35), 13 km (8 miles) north of [[Highway 401 (Ontario)|Highway 401]], 6 km (3 miles) north of [[Highway 407 (Ontario)|Highway 407]] and 64 km (41 miles) south of [[Barrie, Ontario|Barrie]]. It is bounded by Highway 400 to the west, [[Jane Street]] to the east, Major Mackenzie Dr. to the north and Rutherford Rd. to the south. Formerly quite isolated, it is now surrounded by housing on all sides. It has three public entrances and one entrance designated for staff, deliveries and buses. Regular transit access is provided by [[York Region Transit]] (YRT), while [[GO Transit]], [[Brampton Transit]], and [[Mississauga Transit]] all run special services, as does YRT from [[Newmarket, Ontario|Newmarket]] and [[Markham, Ontario|Markham]].

===Public transportation===
Transportation to the park is available from the following of the regional transit organizations:
* [[Toronto Transit Commission]] on behalf of York Region Transit: Toronto - Route 165 Weston Road North to [[York Mills (TTC)|York Mills]] Station via [[Wilson (TTC)|Wilson]] Station.
* Mississauga Transit- Route 288, express, non-stop trip to/from Canada's Wonderland, starting/ending at Mississauga's [[Square One Shopping Centre|Square One]].
* York Region Transit: Markham & [[Richmond Hill, Ontario|Richmond Hill]]: route 4 Major Mackenzie , Vaughan & [[King, Ontario|King]]: Route 20 Jane-Concord. Route 87 Langstaff-Maple also passes by the park without entering the bus loop. Until the 2007 season, YRT operated two express routes to/from Canada's Wonderland, known as the Wonderbus Routes 318 and 319, to the GO Bus Terminal in Newmarket, and the Markville Mall in Markham via YRT's Richmond Hill Centre terminal at Yonge St. and Hwy. 7. These routes were however discontinued as of summer 2007.
* GO Transit: Wonderland GO Bus Service from York Mills Bus Terminal and [[Yorkdale Bus Terminal]].
* Brampton Transit: Route 66 from Bramalea City Centre.

Each of the above services provide at least one specific, seasonal routes to the park. As well, the YRT operates six year-round routes that are either diverted into or stop near the park during its operating season. The bus loop at Wonderland is located near the north-east corner of the park, and is accessed from Major MacKenzie Drive.

==Trivia==
{{Trivia|date=January 2008}}
* A 1982 episode of ''[[The Littlest Hobo]]'', entitled "Forget Me Not", was set at the park.<ref name="TLH">{{cite web
|url=http://www.kevinmccorrytv.com/hobo.html
|title=The Littlest Hobo

}}</ref>
* The park played host on several occasions to the now defunct [[City TV]] program ''[[Electric Circus]]''.
* Contrary to stories that circulate, no person has ever drowned in either the pool at the bottom of the waterfall, or in the fountain in the front gate area.  The walkway behind Victoria Falls (as they are known) was closed due to difficulty in keeping the area up to required corporate safety standards, and the ease with which people could access the pool.
* When the park first opened, guests had the ability to walk to the top of Wonder Mountain. The walkway was eventually closed to make way for the addition of Vortex, whose supports and turnaround block both the old pathway and overlook areas.

==Logos==
The park from its opening in 1981 was known as Canada's Wonderland.  In 1994, when it was sold to [[Paramount Pictures]] (later [[Viacom (1971-2005)|Viacom]]), they changed the name of the park to include the word Paramount, something [[Paramount Parks]] did with all of its other parks in 1993.  Previous to that, none of the Paramount owned parks had the Paramount prefix.  

The logo was completely changed to be in the style of the [[Paramount Parks]] logo, as well as their other theme park properties, which all had the same styled logos, including the Paramount prefix, and the [[Paramount Pictures]] mountain logo.

In 2003, Viacom updated the logo of Paramount Parks, and all its theme parks, including Wonderland, to include an updated Paramount logo, even though the logo for Paramount Pictures, the film studio, remained unchanged.

In 2007, [[CBS Corporation]], (renamed from Viacom in 2005), sold all of its theme park properties to [[Cedar Fair]], which in turn, dropped the Paramount prefixes from all five parks, and gave the logos the Cedar Fair logo and font style.
