The '''Nangar Khel incident''', sometimes called the '''Nangar Khel massacre''', took place in the [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] village of [[Nangar Khel]] ([[Paktika Province]]) on August 16, 2007. Following an insurgent [[Improvised explosive device|IED]] ambush which injured two soldiers from another Polish patrol in the area, a patrol of [[Polish Armed Forces|Polish soldiers]] from the elite 18th Airborne-Assault Battalion taking part in the [[International Security Assistance Force]] responded with [[heavy machine gun]] fire and fired a 60&nbsp;mm [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]] at the village. The attack resulted in the deaths of six civilians, including a pregnant woman and three children, and seriously injured three other women.<ref>http://en.rian.ru/world/20110524/164203223.html</ref><ref>http://www.wbj.pl/article-50605-wikileaks-report-details-nangar-khel-massacre.html</ref>

==Incident==
According to the military report D9 161030z of the [[Afghan War Diary]], the patrol fired 26 mortar rounds, of which three landed in a compound where a wedding celebration was taking place.<ref name="wikileaks_Nangar_Khel">{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| coauthors =| title =D9 161030z TF White Eagle SIR on mortar landing in a village vic Wazi Khwa| work =[[Afghan War Diary]]| publisher =[[Wikileaks]]| date =2010-07-25| url =http://wardiary.wikileaks.org/afg/event/2007/08/AFG20070816n891.html | doi =| accessdate =2010-07-30 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5rcOMKpzC |archivedate=2010-07-30 |deadurl=no}}</ref> The villagers stated that there was no shooting coming from the village when the mortars were fired there,<ref name="wikileaks_Nangar_Khel_manage_2" /> while the Polish soldiers stated that they had fired a machine gun at four people near the village, who in turn fired back.<ref name="wikileaks_Nangar_Khel"/> The villagers stated that the Polish soldiers should have come to the village to ask for information regarding Taliban fighters planting of [[improvised explosive device|IED]]s, since the villagers were opposed to Talibs' operations near their village.<ref name="wikileaks_Nangar_Khel_manage_2" />

That evening and the following day, the Provincial Reconstruction Team and Polish soldiers planned "consequence management", including contact with the villagers, gifts of food and supplies, the purchase of a goat for the villagers as a goodwill gesture, and regular visits to the village in order to build "trust and rapport with the villagers".<ref name="wikileaks_Nangar_Khel_manage_2">{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| coauthors =| title =171635Z PRT Sharana Daily Report| work =[[Afghan War Diary]]| publisher =[[Wikileaks]]| date =2010-07-25| url =http://wardiary.wikileaks.org/afg/event/2007/08/AFG20070817n969.html | doi =| accessdate =2010-07-30 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5rcPeRVzy |archivedate=2010-07-30 |deadurl=no}}</ref><ref name="wikileaks_Nangar_Khel_manage_1">{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| coauthors =| title =161650Z PRT Sharana Daily Report| work =[[Afghan War Diary]]| publisher =[[Wikileaks]]| date =2010-07-25| url =http://wardiary.wikileaks.org/afg/event/2007/08/AFG20070816n913.html | doi =| accessdate =2010-07-30 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5rcPZxkPL |archivedate=2010-07-30 |deadurl=no}}</ref> Families of the victims were later paid compensation, while the injured Afghans were flown to be treated for their wounds in a hospital in Poland.

==Trial==
On July 6, 2008, prosecutors ended the investigation and sent an [[indictment]] against seven soldiers of the Charlie combat team (two officers, two non-commissioned officers and three privates) to the [[Warsaw]]'s Military District Court, accusing them of committing a [[war crime]] of unlawfully targeting civilians in a reprisal.<ref>[http://news.trendaz.com/index.shtml?show=news&newsid=1243284&lang=EN Polish soldiers face trial for killing Afghan civilians] {{dead link|date=November 2010}}</ref> Captain Olgierd C. and his men all say they are innocent. Six of them (accused of killing civilians), if found guilty, would face a penalty of 12 to 25 years in prison to even life imprisonment, while another one (accused of opening fire on an unarmed target) faces up to 25 years in prison. According to spokesperson for the Court, "It's a unique trial, not only in Poland but also in Europe or even in the world." Nevertheless, the case was given little attention in foreign media.

The trial began in February 2009. In May, Polish Minister of Defense [[Bogdan Klich]] gave a testimony in which he called the incident "a mistake", citing opinion of commander of the [[United States|U.S.]] forces in the area. The soldiers have also gained support from many military officers and celebrities, including General [[S<U+0142>awomir Petelicki]], the founder and first commander of the Polish special forces unit [[GROM]]. On June 1, 2011, the Warsaw District Court acquitted all seven soldiers for lack of evidence of deliberate killing. The court described the case as unprecedented in the history of the Polish military and judiciary. The prosecution has the right of appeal against the verdict.<ref>

==Re-trial 2012==
Poland's [[Supreme Court of Poland|highest court]] opened a new trial for seven Polish soldiers in 2012. Prosecutors said that they are convinced that war crimes were committed. The first ruling "should not stand," prosecutor Jan Zak said.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-501714_162-57391581/poland-retries-soldiers-in-2007-deaths-of-afghans/ | work=CBS News | title=Poland retries soldiers in 2007 deaths of Afghans}}</ref>

In 2013 trial was still in court, especially case of ppor.(lower OF-1 Nato code rank) Bywalec, chor.(OR-8 Nato code) Andrzej Osiecki, plut. rezerwy(OR-4 higher, but reserve status - "rezerwy") Tomasz Borysiewicz and Ligocki, were sent to be examined by the Supreme Court, because there were doubts about their "innocent" status.<ref>http://wiadomosci.wp.pl/kat,1342,title,Proces-ws-Nangar-Khel-koniec-przesluchania-oskarzonych,wid,15394216,wiadomosc.html</ref>
