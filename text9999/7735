In [[cardiology]], a '''drug-eluting stent''' is a [[stent]] (a scaffold) placed into narrowed, diseased [[coronary artery|coronary arteries]] that slowly releases a [[drug]] to block [[Hyperplasia|cell proliferation]]. This prevents scar-tissue<U+2013>like growth that, together with clots ([[thrombus]]), could otherwise block the stented artery.

Heart attacks, or [[myocardial infarction]]s, are major causes of death and disability; they result when a portion of heart muscle dies from [[ischemia|inadequate blood flow]]. This typically occurs at sites where coronary arteries are already narrowed and damaged. Fat and cholesterol deposition as well as inflammation in the arterial wall [[atherogenesis|cause injury]]; excessive tissue growth and additional [[cholesterol]] deposition occur, and clots form. These narrowings are prone to being suddenly blocked, or a piece may break off and block a smaller branch downstream ([[embolism]]). If blood flow can be restored early enough, permanent damage can be prevented, and pre-emptive manipulation can prevent heart attacks from occurring in the first place.

Coronary artery stents, typically a metal framework, can be placed inside the artery to help keep it open. However, as the stent is a foreign object (not native to the body), it incites an immune response. This may cause scar tissue (cell proliferation) to rapidly grow over the stent. In addition, there is a strong tendency for clots to form at the site where the stent damages the arterial wall. Since [[platelet]]s are involved in the clotting process, patients must take [[antiplatelet drug|antiplatelet]] therapy afterwards, usually [[clopidogrel]] for six months and [[aspirin]] indefinitely.<ref name="G&G"> {{cite book

}}</ref> However, the antiplatelet therapy may be insufficient to fully prevent clots; these and the cell proliferation may cause the standard (<U+201C>bare-metal<U+201D>) stents to become blocked. Drug-eluting stents were designed to lessen this problem; by releasing an antiproliferative drug (drugs typically used against cancer or as [[immunosuppressant]]s), they can help avoid this ''in-stent restenosis'' (re-narrowing). 

Drug-eluting stents have been shown to be superior to traditional stents ("bare-metal stents") in reducing short-term complications.  Their long term effectiveness compared to traditional stents or coronary bypass grafting is under scrutiny by the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]].<ref>[http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/news/091406.html FDA Statement on Coronary Drug-Eluting Stents (September 14, 2006)]</ref>

==Structure==
Drug-eluting stents consist of three parts. The stent itself is an expandable framework, usually metal. Added to this is a drug to prevent the artery from being re-occluded, or blocked. These typically have been drugs already in use as anti-cancer drugs or drugs that suppress the immune system, although new drugs are being developed specifically for drug-eluting stents. Finally, there must be a carrier which slowly releases the drug over months. The carrier is typically a [[polymer]], although [[phosphorylcholine]] or ceramics are also being researched.<ref name="NEJM review">{{cite journal | authors=Serruys PW, Kutryk MJ, Ong AT. | title = Coronary-Artery Stents | journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 354 | issue = 5 | pages = 483<U+2013>95 | id = PMID 16452560}}</ref>  Different carriers release the loaded drug at different rates.

==Placement==
The stent is loaded in its collapsed form onto a balloon at the end of a [[catheter]] which has a guide wire. The device is then introduced through a [[peripheral artery]], usually at the groin through one of the [[femoral artery|femoral arteries]]. It is threaded back towards the [[heart]]. In the [[aorta]] just prior to entering the heart, the appropriate coronary artery is entered. The balloon is then inflated, cracking and compressing the [[atheroma|plaque]] and expanding the stent. The balloon may be inflated and deflated several times. The balloon and catheter are then withdrawn, leaving the stent, which will release its drug over the next several months.

==Current devices==
Currently, two models of drug-eluting stents are used. Both drugs currently in use were previously developed for other purposes; their use to prevent in-stent proliferation is relatively new.

The first successful type releases [[sirolimus]] (rapamycin), a powerful immunosuppressive and antiproliferative drug. Sirolimus is primarily used as an immunosuppressant to prevent organ transplant rejection. Produced by the bacterium ''[[Streptomyces]] hygroscopicus'', it binds to the [[immunophilin]] FKBP-12. The resulting complex inhibits the [[mammalian target of rapamycin]] (mTOR), which has several effects, including preventing the cell from duplicating its genetic material and thereby blocking the [[cell cycle]] at the G<sub>1</sub><U+2192>S transition.<ref name="G&G sirolimus">{{cite book

A second model uses [[paclitaxel]], another antiproliferative drug; it is primarily used against various forms of cancer. Derived from the [[yew]] tree, paclitaxel binds to and stabilizes [[microtubule]]s.

The first procedural method to treat blocked [[coronary artery|coronary arteries]] was a type of [[open-heart surgery]] called [[coronary artery bypass graft]] (CABG) surgery, which uses a section of vein or artery from elsewhere in the body to bypass the diseased vessel. In 1977, [[Andreas Gr<U+00FC>ntzig]] introduced [[percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty]] (PTCA), also called balloon angioplasty, in which a catheter was introduced through a peripheral artery and a balloon expanded to compress and crack the obstructive plaque.<ref name="NEJM Gruntzig">{{cite journal

Initial difficulties included blood clotting and occluding the stent in the hours or days after placement.<ref name="Harrison's" /> Coating the stent with biologically inert substances like platinum or gold did not help.<ref name="NEJM review" /> Eventually, using high balloon pressures to tightly fix the stent against the vessel and administering aspirin and (usually) clopidogrel as anticoagulants were established; these changes eliminated most of the difficulty with in-stent thrombosis.<ref name="NEJM review" /><sup>, </sup><ref name="Harrison's" />

Difficulties still remained, however, with the formation of scar tissue inside the stent (in-stent neointimal hyperplasia) and clotting problems not addressed by the antiplatelet drug regimen. The stent itself was a logical choice for delivering medication. The slow release of drugs from the stent spares the patient the inconvenience of taking yet another medication, and prevents the danger of the patient forgetting to take or losing interest in taking the medicine. But more importantly, a stent that releases a drug can deliver high concentrations directly to the target region, analogous to placing a medicated cream on a skin problem or taking an inhaler to help the lungs or airways. Taking the medication orally or intravenously would require much higher doses to ensure a sufficient concentration at the target; this could cause unacceptable side effects or patient injury.

The first successful trials were of [[sirolimus]]-eluting stents. A successful trial in 2002 led to approval of the Cypher stent in Europe, followed by FDA approval in the U.S. in 2003.<ref name="NEJM review" /> Soon thereafter, a series of trials of paclitaxel-eluting stents led to FDA approval of the Taxus stent in 2004.<ref name="FDA Taxus" />

==Uses==
There has been considerable research showing the benefits of coronary stents. Data specifically on drug-eluting stents are less abundant, though where studied, they have usually been shown to be superior to bare-metal stents, and in some cases, may be used for lesions for which surgery was previously the only option. Drug-eluting stents are used both for restoring blood flow immediately after a heart attack and also electively for improving blood flow in a compromised vessel. Only certain types of blockages are amenable to stent placement, though drug-eluting stents may be successful in lesions for which bare-metal stents were insufficient. Drug-eluting stents are used to reopen grafts from prior CABG surgery that have themselves become blocked, and also can be used in cases of in-stent restenosis in prior stents.<ref name="NEJM review" />

==Current research==
Research focuses on establishing the roles for drug-eluting stents and for developing new types of stents. Different materials for all three components<U+2014>the scaffolding, the carrier, and the drug<U+2014>are being actively investigated.

In place of the stainless steel currently used in stents, various biodegradable frameworks are under early phases of investigation. Since metal, as a foreign substance, provokes inflammation, scarring, and thrombosis (clotting), it is hoped that biodegradable or bioabsorbable stents may prevent some of these effects. A [[magnesium]] alloy<U+2013>based stent has been tested in animals, though there is currently no carrier for drug elution.<ref name="Heart magnesium">{{cite journal

There are also several other anti-proliferative drugs under investigation in human clinical trials. In general, these are analogues of sirolimus. Like sirolimus, these block the action of mTOR.

Coronary Bypass Surgery versus Percutaneous Coronary Intervention
The rapid developments in both surgical and percutaneous techniques have been such that the choice of the optimum revascularisation strategy is changing, often without an established evidence base; this is particularly true in complex conditions including patients with three-vessel and left main stem anatomy. The widespread use of drug eluting stents has resulted in a significant reduction in patients referred for CABG although published data favours the surgical approach in this high-risk group.
The SYNTAX Trial [http://www.syntaxtrial.com/smartsite.dws?id=320]aims to explore the interface between treatment with coronary bypass grafting and PCI in patients with three-vessel and left main stem disease, comparing coronary bypass grafting using contemporary techniques and PCI using drug eluting TAXUS stents.

Recently, research has revealed that drug eluting stents are associated with a 5 fold higher risk for late thrombosis compared to bare metal stents.  Although this risk is still small, fatality results in one-third of patients who develop late thrombosis.<ref> Bavry AA, Kumbhani DJ, Helton TJ, Borek PP, Mood GR, and Bhatt DL. Late Thrombosis and Drug Eluting Stents: A Meta-Analysis of Randomized Clinical Trials. American Journal of Medicine 2006; 119 (12): 1056 - 1061. [PMID:17145250]</ref>

==Complications and controversy==
In the last several years, drug-eluting stent use has become increasingly popular, both in place of surgery and for lesions not severe enough for surgery. Placing stents is not without risk, however, and the recent development of the drug-eluting stents means that long-term data, especially in comparison to traditional bare-metal stents, are not available. As enthusiasm for the new devices abates, there is some concern about overzealous use of stents in general.

As with all cardiac catheterization, there are several risks. Patients may exhibit severe allergic response to the contrast agents used to visualize the coronary arteries, and occasionally, the peripheral entry artery fails to properly heal after the catheter is removed, causing a collection of blood called a [[hematoma]]. Rarely, a coronary artery can be perforated while the catheter is advanced or during stent placement.<ref name="Harrison's" />

Finally, stent [[occlusion]] can occur. [[Thrombosis]] may occur during the procedure, in the following days, or much later. Stents cause damage to the vessel wall, and, as foreign objects, they provoke inflammation and clot formation. And tissue proliferation in the stent can cause the vessel to narrow again. Patients with stents (but not those undergoing isolated balloon angioplasty) must remain on an antiplatelet drug like clopidogrel for at least three to six months; discontinuing it, even for a short time, can cause a clot to form;<ref name="Harrison's" /> aspirin must be taken for life.<ref name="NEJM review" /> Drug-eluting stents have been shown to have significantly lower rates of in-stent proliferation compared to bare-metal stents. However, some studies suggest that the proliferation may be merely delayed; when the drug has been completely eluted, proliferation may occur.<ref name="NEJM review" /> The magnitude and significance of this effect is unclear. Rarely, a type of allergic reaction to the drug may occur; episodes of fatality have been reported.<ref name="hypersensitivity">{{cite journal

}}</ref>

Nevertheless, coronary stents, and drug-eluting stents in particular, have revolutionized the treatment of coronary heart disease, and new techniques and materials that may ameliorate these problems are being studied. Bioabsorble or biodegradable polymer or stent may help avoid the inflammation and other side effects of long-term foreign objects. Different carriers affect the rate of release of drug, and different antiproliferative drugs may have different clinical effects.<ref name="NEJM review" /> The success of drug-eluting stents in coronary disease has prompted investigation of their use in other narrowed arteries, such as the [[carotid artery|carotid arteries]] leading to the brain.<ref name="carotid">{{cite journal
