Stewart retained his law practice until failing health and advanced age intervened. At the time of his death, he was one of the most prominent figures in Youngstown's legal community.<ref name="vind-yo-10-29-39"/> 

== Early years ==
Stewart was born in [[New Castle, Pennsylvania]], the son of Lemuel A. Stewart, a bricklayer.<ref name="vind-yo-10-29-39"/> The family moved to Youngstown when Stewart was still a young child. Despite the elder Stewart's expressed desire that his son follow in his trade, William Stewart pursued his studies at Youngstown's [[Rayen High School (Youngstown, Ohio)|Rayen School]], where he earned a diploma in 1883.<ref name="vind-yo-10-29-39"/>

After graduating from high school, Stewart became a baggage master with the old P.C. & P. Railroad. He went on to [[read law]] in the [[Cincinnati]] office of [[Laurin D. Woodworth]], a two-term congressman, and Benjamin Franklin Wirt, a former state senator.<ref name="valley_voice-02-11-2005"/> During this time, Stewart developed a brisk sideline helping [[American Civil War|Civil War]] veterans cut through government [[red tape]] to secure their pensions.<ref name="vind-yo-10-29-39"/>

== Legal career ==
Upon the sale of his practice, Stewart acquired enough money to enter [[Cincinnati Law School]], where he graduated in 1886.<ref name="vind-yo-10-29-39"/> He returned to Youngstown and established law offices in a downtown landmark known as "the old Diamond block".<ref name="vind-yo-10-15-24">

Chambers, of employing racist rhetoric in his campaign. "This argument is not in good taste for the reason that we are not living in the far South where the colored man is not allowed by Democrats to exercise the rights of a free American citizen", the editorial stated. "We are in the North, where all men are equal".<ref name="valley_voice-02-11-2005"/> The editorial outlined Stewart's qualifications for public office and indicated he had "won the esteem and good wishes of everyone who knows him".<ref name="valley_voice-02-11-2005"/> At the close of the election, Stewart defeated Chambers by a margin of more than 900 votes.<ref name="valley_voice-02-11-2005"/>

In 1897, Stewart was unanimously nominated for re-election at his party's convention. At a time when U.S. senators were elected by state lawmakers, Stewart publicly vowed to support the senatorial bid of [[Cleveland]] political boss [[Mark Hanna]], who managed the successful presidential campaign of [[William McKinley]] in 1896.<ref name="valley_voice-02-11-2005"/> His Democratic opponent, Mark R. Morris, promised to vote against Hanna. Ultimately, Stewart prevailed over Morris by a vote of 6,075 to 5,749.<ref name="valley_voice-02-11-2005"/> 

During his two terms as a state lawmaker, Stewart sponsored legislation that provided pensions to police and firemen, ensured tax support for the establishment of St. Elizabeth's Hospital, and initiated legislation for the construction of Youngstown's Market Street Bridge, which opened up a vibrant business district to the south of the city.<ref name="valley_voice-02-11-2005"/> In addition, he supported the Smith Anti-Mob Violence bill, which featured stronger measures to prevent vigilante justice.<ref name="valley_voice-02-11-2005"/> In 1897, during his campaign for a second term in the state legislature, Stewart hosted the convention of the National League of Colored Voters of [[Pennsylvania]], [[Ohio]], [[New York]], and [[West Virginia]], which was held in Youngstown that year.<ref name="valley_voice-02-11-2005"/>

Stewart chose not to seek a third term in the Ohio Senate, stating that his responsibilities as a lawmaker interfered with his law practice. After an unsuccessful bid for probate judge, he abandoned politics altogether.<ref name="vind-yo-05-29-55">
