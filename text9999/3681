'''Oliver Valentine''' is a [[fictional character]] from the [[BBC]] [[medical drama]] ''[[Holby City]]'', played by actor [[James Anderson (actor)|James Anderson]]. He first appeared in the [[Holby City (series 11)|eleventh series]] episode "Proceed With Caution", broadcast on 9&nbsp;June&nbsp;2009. Oliver was introduced alongside his older sister, [[Penny Valentine (Holby City)|Penny]] ([[Emma Catherwood]]), as a [[Foundation Programme|Foundation House Officer 1]] (F1) on rotation at [[Holby City Hospital]]. Series producer Diana Kyle intended their inclusion to have an "instant impact on the wards." Anderson was selected to play Oliver; he spent time with a real F1 doctor and trained  with the programme's medical advisors to prepare for the part. It took him around six months to ease into the role, and a further six to feel comfortable in it. 

Oliver was initially portrayed as "the golden boy" compared to his sister. Boyishly charming and medically talented, he nonetheless lacked confidence in his ability.<ref name=bbcollie/> When Oliver reached his F2 training, the series formed an on-screen duo by pairing him with [[Specialist registrar|registrar]] [[Greg Douglas (Holby City)|Greg Douglas]] ([[Edward MacLiam]]). Oliver's lack of competency was highlighted <U+2013> he endangered patients and landed his colleagues in trouble. In a prominent storyline, Oliver made a series of medical errors, which forced him to admit that he cheated on an exam at medical school. He began a downward spiral, and reached "rock bottom" when Penny was killed off. He was then central to a special flashback episode, which depicted his battle to cope with her death. Though he confessed to Director of Surgery [[Henrik Hanssen]] ([[Guy Henry (actor)|Guy Henry]]) that he was not truly qualified, Hanssen allowed Oliver to continue practising medicine.<ref name=guyhenry/>

Branded a Lothario-type character, Oliver has been involved in several romantic storylines during his tenure; Anderson has called him "the hospital bike".<ref name="RC"/> In a toy boy storyline with ward sister [[Chrissie Williams]] ([[Tina Hobley]]), Oliver was seen to compromise his career. He went on to date ward sister [[Daisha Anderson]] ([[Rebecca Grant (British actress)|Rebecca Grant]]), kiss registrar [[Jac Naylor]] ([[Rosie Marcel]]), and earn the unreciprocated affection of ward sister [[Frieda Petrenko]] ([[Olga Fedori]]). 

Responses to the character have generally been negative, with particular criticism for his poor treatment of Penny. Bree Treacy of RT<U+00C9> Ten disliked both Valentines, and [[Jim Shelley (TV critic)|Jim Shelley]] of the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' described him as a "weasel".<ref name="JS"/> Many have questioned Oliver's medical skills and labelled him an incompetent doctor <U+2013> as Daniel Maier of ''[[The Guardian]]'' put it, he is "a doctor with the blue eyes of Fonda and the medical competence of fondue".<ref name="DM"/>

{{cquote|Careless and cocksure, Oliver Valentine has always been something of a golden boy, leaving sister Penny in his shadow.

The impending arrival of sibling trainee doctors Oliver and Penny was announced in May&nbsp;2009, by executive producer [[Tony McHale]] and series producer Diana Kyle. The latter described them both as "full of energy and enthusiasm", and asserted that they would have an "instant impact on the wards at every level." They were deemed talented physicians with the desire to achieve by McHale, who noted that "one is more naturally gifted than the other", and suggested that their personal lives would cause conflict with their professional ones, as they attempted to progress at work.<ref name=tonydiana/> 

Actor [[James Anderson (actor)|James Anderson]] was cast as Oliver. Before assuming the role, he shadowed a real F1 doctor on ward rounds <U+2013> an experience he found difficult. "We were approaching beds in which people were waking up from heart attacks and coming around quite distressed sometimes. It was really difficult to be there with a patient. It's harder than you think and I got quite emotional."<ref name=greg/> Anderson underwent such extensive training with the programme's medical advisors that he jested in June&nbsp;2009, "If I started medical training now, I could probably graduate as a doctor coming out of the show!"<ref>{{cite video |people=[[James Anderson (actor)|James Anderson]] & [[Emma Catherwood]] |date=9 June 2009 |title=Holby's James: 'I feel like a real doctor' |url=http://www.whatsontv.co.uk/drama/holby-city/news/holbys-james-i-feel-like-a-real-doctor-video/6063 |format=Flash Video |medium= Interview |publisher=''[[What's on TV]]''. [[IPC Media]] |accessdate=1 July 2011 |time=01:01}}</ref> The actor experienced "an extended period of anxiety" upon joining the series, and recalls: "It took me about six months to have any sense of what was going on and then the second six months to feel comfortable [...] but only because it's such a well-oiled machine. You're coming in as a little cog, so you have to discover how to work in that and that takes a while."<ref name=greg/>

===Relationships===
Introduced as a Lothario-type character, according to Anderson, Oliver "had a reputation for being the hospital bike."<ref name="RC"/> His first relationship developed when he attracted the attention of ward sisters Chrissie Williams and Daisha Anderson. Daisha showed less interest in him than Chrissie, of whose attentiveness Anderson said, "I think any hot-blooded male would find that attractive". Oliver appeared to ruin his chances with Daisha when he encouraged a patient to complain about her diagnosis <U+2013> though Anderson noted, "he does apologise to Daisha, and sweetly gives her a cupcake". This left Chrissie free to pursue Oliver. Before their relationship began, Anderson opined "She's gorgeous, and Oliver would be a fool not to go out with her." He thought that Oliver and Chrissie's "unflappable" natures made them a good fit for one another, though wondered if they were too alike.<ref name=girls/> As an older woman, their relationship was described as a "toyboy storyline" for Chrissie. Hobley admitted to having fun with the storyline due to the real age gap between herself and Anderson. She described Chrissie's feelings for Oliver, stating: "Chrissie is having a lot of fun with him. But deep down she's really hoping to find true love <U+2013> she's been quite unlucky so far. She's not getting any younger and she's worried about missing out on kids."<ref name=hobley>{{cite web|last=O'Boyle|first=Claire|title=My husband loves this photo so much he put it up in our bedroom|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/My+husband+loves+this+photo+so+much+he+put+it+up+in+our+bedroom%3b...-a0203936882|work=[[Daily Mirror]]|publisher=([[Trinity Mirror]])|accessdate=14 June 2011|date=18 July 2009}}</ref> Producers Kyle and McHale revealed that the pair could have been a "perfect match", however said the romance would not run smoothly.<ref name=tonydiana>{{cite web|last=Green|first=Kris|title=Tony McHale/Diana Kyle ('Holby City')|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s19/holby-city/interviews/a157363/tony-mchalediana-kyle-holby-city.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hachette Filipacchi UK]])|accessdate=14 June 2011|date=29 May 2009}}</ref>

Series producer Myar Craig Brown revealed that the big focus would be on the effect it had on Oliver. Forced to come to terms with her death, he faced an "emotional rollercoaster of feeling that he was second best to her".<ref name=dsmyar>{{cite web|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|title=Exclusive: 'Holby City' teasers from producer Myar Craig-Brown|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s19/holby-city/scoop/a325663/holby-city-teasers-from-producer-myar-craig-brown.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hachette Filipacchi UK]])|accessdate=22 June 2011|date=19 June 2011<!--|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5zdXQLVFr|archivedate=22 June 2011-->}}</ref>

===Career===
Having arrived at Holby as an F1, Oliver quickly progressed onto his F2 training. This resulted in "professional jealousy" forming with Penny, and in retaliation to their disagreements, he put her career in jeopardy by revealing her affair.<ref name="Shocking">{{cite web|title=Oliver reveals Penny's shocking secret|url=http://www.whatsontv.co.uk/drama/holby-city/story-so-far/oliver-reveals-pennys-shocking-secret/7411|work=[[What's on TV]]|publisher=([[IPC Media]])|accessdate=18 June 2011|date=12 May 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/We+love+telly%3b+PICK+OF+THE+DAY.-a0225907829|title=We love telly; Pick of the Day|last=Simon|first=Jane|date=11 May 2010|work=[[Daily Mirror]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|accessdate=22 June 2011}}</ref> Registrar Greg Douglas was appointed as Oliver's mentor. The fast-paced storyline saw Greg initially "kick[ing] against his newfound responsibility", before realising that Oliver could be beneficial to his own career, which resulted in an "unlikely friendship" forming between them. Though a "fairly light, buddy-buddy" storyline to begin with, Anderson felt that filming their scenes was "intensive". Speaking of their friendship, Anderson explained: "We start off on the wrong foot with each other and we're competitive, which is unhelpful to the patients and (initially) we're not out to help one another at all. But they have similarities... in terms of dropping people in it." The pace of the storyline had to be changed when Anderson injured his knee upon falling down a ten foot cellar.<ref name=greg>{{cite news|title=Dishy doctors brighten up Holby City|url=http://www.dailypost.co.uk/leisure/tv-wales/programme-news/2010/07/17/dishy-doctors-brighten-up-holby-city-55578-26866455/|work=[[Daily Post (North Wales)|Daily Post]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|accessdate=18 June 2011|date=17 July 2010}}</ref> The pair clashed over conflicting medical opinions on patient care,<ref>{{cite web|last=McIver|first=Brian|title=Record tv, Pick of the day|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Record+tv%3b+PICK+OF+THE+DAY.-a0235364454|work=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]|publisher=([[Trinity Mirror]])|accessdate=23 June 2011|date=25 August 2010}}</ref> and their friendship soon created a negative effect over Oliver's work ethic.

Oliver's career further deteriorated in early 2011, when it transpired he was not a qualified doctor. A series of setbacks <U+2013> failing the exam to progress on to his F3 year, blaming a surgical error on Penny, and the death of a patient in his care <U+2013> prompted him to admit that he swapped his own exam paper with Penny's in his final year of medical school. Anderson explained that Oliver could no longer cope with the mounting pressure, hence his confession. Contrasting the siblings, he assessed "[Oliver] was seen as the golden boy when he arrived at Holby <U+2013> but he was trading on his sister's success." Issued with the ultimatum of confessing to Director of Surgery Henrik Hanssen, Oliver realised that "he must take responsibility", lest he "lose the one person who loves him unconditionally."<ref name="RC">{{cite journal|title=Russell Crowe made me famous|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|first=Katy|last=Moon|date=12 <U+2013> 18 March|issue=10|page=38}}</ref>

Believing himself to be in a "impossible dilemma", Anderson said that Oliver was trying to make good on what he had done by repeating his F2 exams. "By exposing the lie he'll end his career, Oliver can't understand why Penny won't stand by him." He added that since Oliver made a serious surgical error, his colleagues had lost trust in his medical capability. When a train crash occurred, he was forced to take control of AAU. Anderson explained: "He's not fully qualified and that's all he can think about. He's struggling." When he saved a patients life, Oliver thought he should keep his job. However, he was then told that Penny had died, news that would "change Oliver's life forever."<ref name=qaz>{{cite journal|last=Ellis|first=Sarah|title=Nobody trusts Oliver anymore...|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|date=9 <U+2013> 15 April 2011|issue=14|pages=40|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]}}</ref> Following Penny's death, Craig-Brown stated that "whether he's good enough to stay in medicine will be [Oliver's] big storyline."<ref name=dsmyar/> The series explored how Oliver coped with her death through a flashback episode. Henry, who plays Hanssen, observed that Oliver's return to work saw him make multiple mistakes and "hit rock bottom". Oliver tried to resign from Holby, though before he left he responded to a dangerous [[Road Traffic Accident|RTA]] call and saved a patient's life. When he was summoned by Hanssen about his resignation, he was given "fatherly advice", and the senior doctor "turned a blind eye" to Oliver's confession. Henry explained that Hanssen "doesn<U+2019>t think a good doctor should lose his chance at a career in medicine", after learning Oliver risked his own life on the job.<ref name=guyhenry>{{cite web|title=Holby's Guy: Hanssen will show a 'more human side'|url=http://www.whatsontv.co.uk/drama/holby-city/interviews/holbys-guy-hanssen-will-show-a-more-human-side/12999|work=[[What's on TV]]|publisher=([[IPC Media]])|accessdate=22 June 2011|date=15 July 2011<!--|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5zdVCcDqc|archivedate=22 June 2011-->}}</ref>

Reviewer's interpretations of Oliver have generally negative. Early in his tenure, he received positive commentary from ''[[Inside Soap]]'', who said, "he may be a whizz-kid trainee doctor, but new Holby recruit Oliver Valentine isn't all work and no play! He's certainly got an eye for the ladies."<ref name=girls>{{cite journal|title=Valentine's girls|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|date=11 <U+2013> 17 July 2009|issue=28|page=35}}</ref> Maeve Quigley, writing for the ''Daily Mirror'', opined that Chrissie was more than a match for Oliver.
