On 2 August 1897, Lejeune assumed command of the Marine Guard of  {{USS|Cincinnati|C-7|6}}, where he served throughout the [[Spanish-American War]]. He was detached from the ''Cincinnati'' on 17 February 1899, and on 18 February 1899, joined {{USS|Massachusetts|BB-2|6}} to command the Marine Guard. He was promoted to [[Captain_(U.S._Marine_Corps)#U.S._Marine_Corps|captain]] on 3 March 1899 and left his position on ''Massachusetts'' on 10 May 1900.

===1900-1916===
From 3 July 1900 to 12 November 1900, Captain Lejeune performed recruiting duty at [[Boston, Massachusetts]], and on 22 November 1900 reported at the Marine Barracks, [[Pensacola, Florida]], to command the Marines. From 12 January 1903 to 21 January 1903, Captain Lejeune was on duty at the Norfolk Barracks, going to recruiting duty at [[New York City]] on 26 January 1903. He was promoted to [[Major (United States)|Major]] on 3 March 1903 and was on duty at [[Headquarters Marine Corps]] in  [[Washington, D.C.]] from 15 May 1903 to 8 August 1903.

On 8 August 1903, Major Lejeune was ordered to {{USS|Panther|AD-6|6}} to command the Marine Battalion on board that vessel, joining 16 August 1903. On 23 October 1903, the battalion, with Lejeune in command, was transferred to {{USS|Dixie|1893|6}}. From 16 December 1903 to 21 December 1904, Major Lejeune was on duty ashore on the [[Isthmus of Panama]] in command of this battalion, leaving there on the latter date on board {{USS|Yankee|1892|6}}.

From 27 January 1905 to 20 May 1906, Lejeune served at the [[Marine Barracks, Washington, D.C.]] He then returned to [[Panama]] in command of a battalion of Marines from 29 May to 6 July 1906, the battalion being transported both ways on board [[USS Columbia|USS ''Columbia'']]. This was detached duty, and on 29 March 1907, Major Lejeune was detached from command of the Washington Barracks and ordered to the [[Philippines]].  His family &mdash; his wife and three daughters accompanied him on this overseas duty.<ref name=Bartlett2004_p197>{{cite book|last=Bartlett|year=2004|title=Commandants of the Marine Corps|page=197}}</ref>

Arriving in the Philippines on 2 May 1907, Lejeune assumed command of the Marine Barracks and Naval Prison, [[Sangley Point|Navy Yard]], [[Cavite]], on 6 May 1907. He assumed command of the First Brigade of Marines on 15 June 1908 and was promoted to [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]] on 13 May 1909. He was detached on 8 June 1909 and ordered to return to the [[United States]].  He then attended the [[U.S. Army War College]], graduating in 1910.<ref name=Bartlett2004_p197/>

Lieutenant Colonel Lejeune embarked on board {{USS|Ohio|BB-12|6}} on 26 May 1912 with the Second Regiment, First Provisional Brigade Marines for [[Cuba]]. He disembarked at [[Guant<U+00E1>namo Bay, Cuba|Guantanamo Bay]], Cuba, on 8 June 1912 and was in command of the [[Santiago de Cuba Province|District of Santiago]] from 9 June, to 14 July 1912. On 15 July 1912, Lejeune embarked on board {{USS|Prairie|1890|6}} and sailed for [[Colon, Panama]]. July 18<U+2013>29, 1912 was spent at Camp Elliott, [[Panama]].

After returning to the United States, Lejeune was again called upon for expeditionary duty. He sailed from [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]], 20 February 1913 as second in command of the First Regiment, Second Provisional Brigade Marines and disembarked 27 February 1913, at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Then-LtCol Lejeune began the [[Marine Corps Association]] with the goal of professional advancement among Marines.  He returned to Philadelphia on board USS ''Prairie'' on 2 May 1913.

On 27 November 1913, Lejeune sailed from New York with the 2nd Advanced Base Regiment, his ultimate destination [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Veracruz]], [[Mexico]], but returned to the United States to receive his promotion to [[colonel]] on 25 February 1914. Colonel Lejeune and his unit eventually landed in Mexico on 22 April 1914 and participated in the occupation of the city. He returned home in December 1914, this time to report to [[Marine Corps Headquarters]] in Washington, D.C., to become assistant to the Major General [[Commandant of the Marine Corps]]. He was promoted to [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] on 29 August 1916.

===World War I===
With the outbreak of [[World War I]], Lejeune assumed command of the newly constructed Marine Barracks, [[Quantico, Virginia]]. However, his overseas service was inevitable, and in June 1918, he arrived at [[Brest, France|Brest]], [[France]]. He was promoted to major general 1 July 1918.

[[File:MGen John A Lejeune.jpg|180px|right|thumb| MGen Lejeune at the front in France.]]

Upon reporting to the commander of the [[American Expeditionary Forces]], he was assigned to command a brigade of the 32nd Division and assumed command of the 4th Brigade of Marines of the 2d Division immediately following the attack of the division in the [[Battle of Soissons (1918)|Battle of Soissons]]. On 28 July 1918, Major General Lejeune assumed command of the 2nd Division and remained in that capacity until August 1919, when the unit was demobilized. He was the second Marine officer to hold an Army divisional command (BG [[Charles A. Doyen]] was the first), and following the [[Armistice with Germany (Compi<U+00E8>gne)|Armistice]] he led his division in the march into [[Germany]].

During that war, he was recognized by the French Government as a strategist and leader, as evidenced by the [[Legion of Honor]], and the [[Croix de Guerre]] bestowed upon him by France. From [[General officer|General]] [[John J. Pershing]], he received the [[Distinguished Service Medal (Army)]]. The [[Navy Distinguished Service Medal]] was conferred upon him when he returned to the United States following the occupation of Germany.  

[[File:John A. Lejeune.jpg|180px|left|thumb| John A. Lejeune with his insigina of commander in the French [[L<U+00E9>gion d'honneur]]]]

In October 1919, he again was appointed Commanding General, Marine Barracks, Quantico, Virginia.

==Commandant of the Marine Corps==
Lejeune was appointed as Major General [[Commandant of the Marine Corps]] on 1 July 1920. Subsequent to that time, he left his headquarters at Washington several times for tours of inspection in [[Haiti]], [[Santo Domingo]], Cuba, [[Puerto Rico]], to the West Coast and elsewhere. Upon the expiration of his second term as Commandant, Lejeune indicated his desire not to retire from the Marine Corps, but was relieved as Commandant in March 1929.

==Retirement and VMI==
On 10 November 1929, Lejeune retired in order to accept the position of Superintendent of the [[Virginia Military Institute]] (VMI), serving there over eight years until October 1937. In February 1942, he was advanced to the rank of [[Lieutenant general (United States)|lieutenant general]] on the Marine Corps retired list.

Lejeune died 20 November 1942 in the [[Union Memorial Hospital]], [[Baltimore, Maryland]], and was interred in the [[Arlington National Cemetery]] with [[military funeral|full military honors]].

 MARINE CORPS ORDERS
 No. 47 (Series 1921)
 HEADQUARTERS U.S. MARINE CORPS
 Washington, November 1, 1921
 
 759. The following will be read to the command on the 10th of November, 1921, and hereafter on the   
 10 November of every year. Should the order not be received by the 10th of November, 1921, it 
 will be read upon receipt.
 
    (1) On November 10, 1775, a Corps of Marines was created by  a resolution of Continental 
 Congress. Since that date many thousand men have borne the name "Marine". In memory of them it is 
 fitting that we who are Marines should commemorate the birthday of our corps by calling to mind the 
 glories of its long and illustrious history.
 
    (2) The record of our corps is one which will bear comparison with that of the most famous 
 military organizations in the world's history. During 90 of the 146 years of its existence the 
 Marine Corps has been in action against the Nation's foes. From the Battle of Trenton to the 
 Argonne, Marines have won foremost honors in war, and in the long eras of tranquility at home, 
 generation after generation of Marines have grown gray in war in both hemispheres and in every 
 corner of the seven seas, that our country and its citizens might enjoy peace and security.
 
    (3) In every battle and skirmish since the birth of our corps, Marines have acquitted themselves 
 with the greatest distinction, winning new honors on each occasion until the term "Marine" has come 
 to signify all that is highest in military efficiency and soldierly virtue.
 
    (4) This high name of distinction and soldierly repute we who are Marines today have received 
 from those who preceded us in the corps. With it we have also received from them the eternal spirit 
 which has animated our corps from generation to generation and has been the distinguishing mark of 
 the Marines in every age. So long as that spirit continues to flourish Marines will be found equal 
 to every emergency in the future as they have been in the past, and the men of our Nation will 
 regard us as worthy successors to the long line of illustrious men who have served as "Soldiers of 
 the Sea" since the founding of the Corps.
 
 JOHN A. LEJEUNE,
 Major General Commandant
