Established in 1998, '''The Drinkmore Cafe''' was reported by [[InfoWorld]] to be the first commercial business to offer free wireless internet [[wifi]] services. Although few had the equipment necessary to take advantage of this, free wireless internet became a major component of the small coffee shop business model across America. Run by former software exec [[Scott Kennedy]], The Drinkmore was the headquarters of [[Seattle Wireless]] and was the [[Howard Dean]] [[meetup]] spot during his 2004 presidential campaign.

Originally built in 1905, the large warehouse was demolished by the owner to make way for new condominiums. The closing of this shop was reported  in [[The Capitol Hill Times]].<ref>http://www.zwire.com/site/index.cfm?newsid=11261843&BRD=855&PAG=461&dept_id=517907&rfi=8{{dead|date=December 2011}}</ref>
