[[File:Dark Run looking downstream.JPG|thumb|left|Dark Run looking downstream near Ringtown]]
Dark Run begins in [[Union Township, Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania|Union Township]], a few tenths of a mile west of the community of Pattersonville. The stream flows north for several tenths of a mile, passing through a [[pond]]. It eventually turns east and passes through another pond before turning northeast. After some distance, the stream receives two unnamed tributaries and turns north-northeast, cutting through a [[ridge]]. On the other side of the ridge, it receives another unnamed tributary and passes through the southeastern corner of [[Ringtown, Pennsylvania|Ringtown]] before returning to Union Township. The stream continues north-northeast and receives another unnamed tributary before cutting through another ridge. It then meanders northeast for approximately a mile until it reaches its confluence with Catawissa Creek on the border between Union Township and [[East Union Township, Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania|East Union Township]].<ref name = "nationalmap"/>

Dark Run joins Catawissa Creek {{convert|24.83|mi|km}} upstream of its mouth.<ref name = "gaz">{{Citation|url = http://www.lycoming.edu/cwi/pdfs/paGazetterOfStreams.pdf|title = Pennsylvania Gazetteer of Streams|date = November 2, 2001|accessdate = October 4, 2014}}</ref>

===Tributaries===
Dark Run has no named tributaries.<ref name = "nationalmap"/> However, it has several unnamed tributaries. "Trib 27590 to Dark Run" is the first unnamed tributary to enter the stream. It is followed closely by "Trib 27589 to Dark Run". "Trib 27588 to Dark Run" and "Trib 27587 to Dark Run" join the stream east of Ringtown. "Trib 27586 to Dark Run" joins it not far from its mouth.<ref name = "conservationplan">{{Citation|author = Pennsylvania Environmental Council|url = http://www.dcnr.state.pa.us/cs/groups/public/documents/document/dcnr_20029597.pdf|title = Catawissa Creek Watershed Rivers Conservation Plan|date = December 9, 2010|accessdate = October 4, 2014}}</ref>

==Hydrology==
Dark Run, along with Little Catawissa Creek, contributes relatively fertile water to Catawissa Creek. However, the stream is affected by [[agricultural runoff]].<ref name = "epcamr">{{Citation|author = R. Moase, T. Copeland, R. Wnuk, R. Mulberger|url = http://www.epcamr.org/storage/watersheds/CatawissaCrFisheriesMgmtRpt1997.pdf|title = PA FISH AND BOAT COMMISSION COMMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS|year = 1997|accessdate = October 5, 2014}}</ref>

The [[pH]] of Dark Run {{convert|2.66|mi|km}} upstream of its mouth is 7.0 and the concentration of [[alkalinity]] at this location is 16 milligrams per liter. The pH of the stream {{convert|1.71|mi|km}} upstream of its mouth is 7.4 and the concentration of alkalinity is 28 milligrams per liter. The [[water hardness]] of the stream {{convert|2.66|mi|km}} upstream of its mouth is 34 milligrams per liter.<ref name = "epcamr"/>

At 1:35 P.M. on June 19, 1997, the air temperature in the vicinity of Dark Run {{convert|2.66|mi|km}} upstream of its mouth was {{convert|29|C|F}}. The water temperature at that location and time was {{convert|17.5|C|F}}. At 12:00 P.M. on June 20, 1997, the air temperature near the stream {{convert|1.71|mi|km}} upstream of its mouth was {{convert|27|C|F}}. The water temperature at this time and location was {{convert|17.2|C|F}}. The [[specific conductivity]] of the stream's waters {{convert|2.66|mi|km}} upstream of its mouth is 118 umhos and the specific conductivity {{convert|1.71|mi|km}} upstream of its mouth is 171 umhos.<ref name = "epcamr"/>

==Geography and geology==
The elevation near the mouth of Dark Run is {{convert|843|ft|m}} above [[sea level]].<ref>{{Citation|url = http://www.topozone.com/states/Pennsylvania.asp?county=Schuylkill&feature=Stream|title = Topographic Map Stream Features in Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania|accessdate = October 4, 2014}}</ref> The elevation of the stream's source is between {{convert|1160|ft|m}} and {{convert|1180|ft|m}} above sea level.<ref name = "nationalmap"/>

Dark Run and all of its tributaries are on rock of the [[Mauch Chunk Formation]]. This [[rock formation]] consists of [[siltstone]], [[sandstone]], grayish-red [[shale]], and [[conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]]. The entire length of the stream and all of its tributaries are on Leck Kill [[soil]].<ref name = "conservationplan"/>

Dark Run is a small stream, with a width of {{convert|3.3|m|ft}}. It has a low gradient of 13.5 meters per kilometer.<ref name = "epcamr"/>

Dark Run is surrounded by areas prone to [[flood]]ing during a [[100-year flood]] between its mouth and Ringtown. "Trib 27588 to Dark Run" is surrounded by such areas throughout its length. There are also a few others areas in the watershed that are prone to flooding during a 100-year flood.<ref name = "conservationplan"/>

==Watershed==
The watershed of Dark Run has an area of {{convert|4.55|sqmi|km2}}.<ref name = "gaz"/> Most of the watershed is in Union Township. However, the watershed also occupies nearly all of Ringtown.<ref name = "conservationplan"/> There is [[agriculture|agricultural]] land throughout the watershed, especially in the valley of the stream.<ref name = "conservationplan"/><ref name = "epcamr"/> Additionally, it contains some club and association land in its upper and lower reaches.<ref name = "conservationplan"/>

Major roads in the watershed of Dark Run include Rattlin Run Road, Ringtown Boulevard, Pattersonville Road, Center Street, and Main Street, the last two of which are in Ringtown.<ref name = "conservationplan"/> 33 percent of the stream's length is within {{convert|100|m|ft}} of a road and 66 percent is within {{convert|300|m|ft}} of one. 95 percent of the stream is within {{convert|500|m|ft}} of a road. In 1990, the [[population density]] of the watershed 40 people per square mile. <ref name = "epcamr"/>

Dark Run is in the [[United States Geological Survey]] quadrangles of Nuremburg and Shenandoah. The stream is one of the southernmost tributaries of Catawissa Creek.<ref name = "epcamr"/>

There are three water resources on Dark Run in its upper reaches. Another water resource is near the mouth of "Trib 27588 to Dark Run" and one other is in the upper reaches of "Trib 27587 to Dark Run".<ref name = "conservationplan"/>

A bridge carrying Farmers Road was built over Dark Run in 1960. It is a [[steel stringer]] bridge that is {{convert|26.9|ft|m}} long. It is currently closed.<ref>{{Citation|url = http://uglybridges.com/pa/schuylkill/|title = Schuylkill County|accessdate = October 5, 2014}}</ref>

==Biology==
Dark Run is considered by the [[Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection]] to be a High-Quality Coldwater Fishery, although it was historically a Coldwater Fishery.<ref name = "conservationplan"/><ref name = "epcamr"/> It is the only tributary of Catawissa Creek to be a High-Quality Coldwater Fishery, but not Class A Wild Trout Waters.<ref name = "conservationplan"/> The stream is inhabited by native [[trout]]. It is one of the few fertile streams in the watershed of Catawissa Creek that supports fish life.<ref name = "conservationplan"/> The stream is considered to be Class D Wild Trout Waters.<ref name = "epcamr"/> A 1997 report advised against [[fish stocking|stocking]] the stream. The stream is not stocked due to its high level of narrowness.<ref name = "epcamr"/>

There are eight species of [[fish]] inhabiting Dark Run. These include [[brook trout]], [[brown trout]], and [[largemouth bass]]. However, the brown trout in the stream are from [[hatchery|hatcheries]] and the largemouth bass come from [[farm pond]]s. Eight fish species inhabit the stream {{convert|2.66|mi|km}} upstream of its mouth and six species inhabit it {{convert|1.71|mi|km}} upstream of its mouth.<ref name = "epcamr"/>

The [[biomass (ecology)|biomass]] of wild brook trout in Dark Run is 6.85 kilograms per hectare, including 0.98 kilograms per hectare of brook trout less than 175 millimeters long and 5.87 kilograms per hectare that are more than 175 millimeters long. These trout range from 50 to 249 millimeters in length. There are 30 brook trout per kilometer that are less than 175 millimeters long and 20 per kilometer that are more than 175 millimeters long. There are 105 brook trout per hectare that are less than 175 millimeters long and 76 per hectare that are more than 175 millimeters long.<ref name = "epcamr"/>

A 1997 report stated that Dark Run was a poor site for angling.<ref name = "epcamr"/>
