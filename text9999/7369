The history of skyscrapers in Tulsa began with the construction of the [[Mid-Continent Tower|Cosden Building]] in 1918, which is often regarded as the city's first skyscraper.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tulsapreservationcommission.org/nationalregister/buildings/index.pl?id=15|title=Cosden Building|accessdate=2007-12-30|publisher=Tulsa Preservation Commission}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tulsadowntown.org/index.cfm?pageID=21&pageParentIDNew=1|title=Downtown Tulsa|accessdate=2007-12-30|publisher=Downtown Tulsa Unlimited}}</ref> Tulsa went through a large building boom in the 1920s, during which many [[Art Deco]] high-rises were constructed. The city then experienced a second, larger building boom that lasted from the early 1960s to the early 1980s, during which time the city saw the construction of the [[BOK Tower]] and the [[CityPlex Towers]] complex. Tulsa is currently the site of four skyscrapers that rise at least 500&nbsp;feet (152&nbsp;m) in height. Overall, the skyline of Tulsa is ranked (based upon existing and under construction buildings over 500&nbsp;feet (152&nbsp;m) tall) third in the [[South Central United States]] (after [[Houston, Texas|Houston]] and [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]]) and 20th in the United States, after [[New York City]], [[Chicago]], [[Miami, Florida|Miami]], Houston, [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], Dallas, [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]], [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]], [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]], [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]], [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]], [[Jersey City, New Jersey|Jersey City]], [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis]], [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]], [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]], [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]] and [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]].{{ref label|note01|A|^}}
