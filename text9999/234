The '''Klis Fortress''' ({{lang-hr|Tvr<U+0111>ava Klis}}) is a [[medieval]] [[fortress]] situated above a [[Klis|village bearing the same name]], near the city of [[Split (city)|Split]], in central [[Dalmatia]], [[Croatia]]. From its origin as a small [[fortification|stronghold]] built by the ancient [[Illyrians|Illyrian]] tribe [[Dalmatae]], becoming a royal castle that was the seat of many [[Kingdom of Croatia (medieval)|Croatian kings]], to its final development as a large fortress during the [[Ottoman wars in Europe]], Klis Fortress has guarded the frontier, being lost and re-conquered several times throughout its more than two thousand year-long history. Due to its location on a pass that separates the mountains [[Mosor]] and [[Mali Kozjak|Kozjak]], the fortress served as a major source of defense in Dalmatia, especially against the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] advance, and has been a key crossroad between the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] belt and the [[Balkans|Balkan]] rear.

Since [[Mislav of Croatia|Prince Mislav]] of [[Principality of Littoral Croatia|Littoral Croatia]] made Klis Fortress the seat of his throne in the middle of the 9th century, the fortress has served as the seat of many Croatia's rulers. The reign of his successor, [[Trpimir I of Croatia|Duke Trpimir I]], the founder of the Croatian royal [[House of Trpimirovi<U+0107>]], is significant for spreading [[Christianity]] in the Littoral Croatia. He largely expanded the Klis Fortress, and in Ri<U+017E>inice, in the valley under the fortress, he built a [[church (building)|church]] and the first [[Benedictine monastery]] in Croatia. During the reign of the first Croatian king, [[Tomislav of Croatia|Tomislav]], Klis and [[Biograd na Moru]] were his chief residences.

In March 1242 at Klis Fortress, [[Tatars]] who were a constituent segment of the [[Mongols|Mongol]] army under the leadership of [[Kadan]] suffered a major defeat while in pursuit of the Hungarian army led by King [[B<U+00E9>la IV of Hungary|B<U+00E9>la IV]]. After their defeat by Croatian forces, the Mongols retreated, and B<U+00E9>la IV rewarded many Croatian towns and nobles with "substantial riches". During the [[Late Middle Ages]], the fortress was governed by [[Croatian nobility]], amongst whom [[Paul I <U+0160>ubi<U+0107> of Bribir]] was the most significant. During his reign, the [[House of <U+0160>ubi<U+0107>]] controlled most of modern-day Croatia and Bosnia. Excluding the brief possession by the forces of [[Kingdom of Bosnia|Bosnian King]], [[Tvrtko I of Bosnia|Tvrtko I]], the fortress remained in Hungaro-Croatian hands for the next several hundred years, until the 16th century.

Klis Fortress is probably best known for its defense against the [[Ottoman wars in Europe|Ottoman invasion of Europe]] in the early 16th century. Croatian captain [[Petar Kru<U+017E>i<U+0107>]] led the defense of the fortress against a Turkish invasion and siege that lasted for more than two and a half decades. During this defense, as Kru<U+017E>i<U+0107> and his soldiers fought without allies against the Turks, the military faction of [[Uskoks]] was formed, which later became famous as an elite Croatian militant sect. Ultimately, the defenders were defeated and the fortress was occupied by the Ottomans in 1537. After more than a century under Ottoman rule, in 1669, Klis Fortress was besieged and seized by the [[Republic of Venice]], thus moving the border between Christian and Muslim Europe further east and helping to contribute to the decline of the Ottoman Empire. The Venetians restored and enlarged the fortress, but it was taken by the [[Austrians]] after [[Napoleon I|Napoleon]] extinguished the republic itself in 1797. Today, Klis Fortress contains a museum where visitors to this historic military structure can see an array of arms, armor, and traditional uniforms.

==Location==

==History==
===Ancient stronghold of Illyrians and Romans===
{{See also|Dalmatae|Illyrian Wars|Roman Empire}}
The ancient [[Illyrians|Illyrian]] tribe of [[Dalmatae]], which held a stronghold on this spot, were the first known inhabitants who lived on the site of what is today Klis Fortress.<ref name="Povijest Klisa">{{cite web | url=http://portal.klis.com.hr/povijest-klisa/ | title=Povijest Klisa | last=Liste<U+0161> | first=Sre<U+0107>ko | work=klis.hr | publisher=Slu<U+017E>bene stranice Op<U+0107>ine Klis | language=Croatian | accessdate=2010-05-16}}</ref> They were defeated several times, and in the year 9 A.D., finally annexed by [[Ancient Rome|Romans]].<ref name="Povijest Klisa"/> Today's Klis Fortress was known to the Romans by the name of ''"Andetrium"'' or ''"Anderium"'',<ref name="Royal Geographical Society 589">Royal Geographical Society (1856), p. 589.</ref> and in later times ''"Clausura"'', which is the origin of later ''"Clissa"'' and modern ''"Klis"''.<ref name="Wilkinson 169-172">Wilkinson (1848), pp. 169<U+2013>172.</ref> To the Romans, Klis became famous for its celebrated siege by [[Augustus]], at the time of the [[Illyrian revolt]] in Dalmatia.<ref name="Collection 111-116">Collection (1805), pp. 111<U+2013>116.</ref> The road that lead from Klis to Salona was called "Via Gabiniana" or "Via Gabinia", which according to an inscription found at Salona, appears to have been made by [[Tiberius]].<ref name="Wilkinson 169-172"/> Southeast of the fortress, the traces of a Roman camp are still visible, as well as an inscription carved on a rock; both which are supposed to be contemporary with the siege under Tiberius.<ref name="Wilkinson 169-172"/> The description of this siege during the [[Illyrian Wars]] demonstrates that this place was strong and unreachable in those times.<ref name="Collection 111-116"/>

===Migration period and the arrival of the Croats===
{{See also|Migration period|Croats}}
After the [[decline of the Roman Empire|fall of the Roman Empire]], Barbarians plundered the region around Klis.<ref name="Fine 22">Fine (The early medieval Balkans&nbsp;<U+2013> 1991), p. 22.</ref> First it was ruled by [[Odoacer]], and then by the [[Theodoric the Great]], after he eliminated Odoacer, and set up an [[Ostrogothic Kingdom]].<ref name="Fine 22"/> After [[Justinian I]] fought an almost continual war for forty years to recover the old Roman Empire, he seized Dalmatia, and Klis was from 537, a part of [[Byzantine Empire]].<ref name="Fine 22"/> The name of Klis (''Kleisa'' or ''Kleisoura'') was first described in chapter 29 of Emperor [[Constantine VII|Constantine Porphyrogenitus']] ''De Administrando Imperio''.<ref name="Curta 100-101">Curta (2006), pp. 100<U+2013>101.</ref> While describing the Roman settlement of [[Salona]], Constantine VII speaks of the stronghold, which may have been designed or improved, to prevent attacks on the coastal cities and roads by [[Slavic peoples|Slavs]].<ref name="Curta 100-101"/>

Salona, the capital of the [[Byzantine Dalmatia|province of Dalmatia]] was sacked and destroyed in 614 by [[Eurasian Avars|Avars]] and [[Slavs]].<ref name="Fine 34-35">Fine (The early medieval Balkans&nbsp;<U+2013> 1991), pp. 34<U+2013>35.</ref> The population fled to [[Diocletian's Palace|Diocletian's]] walled palace of Split, which was able to hold up.<ref name="Fine 34-35"/> Thereafter, Split rose quickly in importance, as one of Dalmatia's major cities.<ref name="Fine 34-35"/> After a few decades, the Avars were driven out by the [[Croats]].<ref name="Fine 34-35"/> This probably happened after 620, when in second wave Croats migrated on the invitation by the Emperor [[Heraclius]] to counter the Avar threat on the Byzantine Empire.<ref name="Constantine Porphyrogenitus">[[Constantine VII|Constantine Porphyrogenitus]], ''De Administrando Imperio'', ed.

===Royal Castle===
{{See also|Littoral Croatian Duchy|Kingdom of Croatia (medieval)}}
From the early 7th century on, Klis was an important Croat stronghold, and later, one of the seats of many Croatia's rulers.<ref name="gra<U+0111>evinar"/> In the 9th century, Croatian prince [[Mislav of Croatia|Mislav]] of [[Principality of Littoral Croatia|Littoral Croatia]], from 835 to 845, made the castle of Klis seat of his throne.<ref name="Hrvatski leksikon 470"/> Despite [[Franks|Frankish]] overlordship, the Franks had almost no role in Littoral Croatia in the period from the 820s through 840s. After Mislav's death, starting with [[Trpimir I of Croatia|Duke Trpimir I]], Klis was ruled by royal members of the [[House of Trpimirovi<U+0107>]], who were at first [[Duke]]s of Littoral Croatian Duchy (''dux Croatorum''), and afterwards [[Monarch|Kings]] of the [[Kingdom of Croatia (medieval)|Croatian Kingdom]] (''rex Croatorum''). They developed the early Roman stronghold into their capital.<ref name="gra<U+0111>evinar"/> Relations with the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] greatly improved under the Croatian duke Trpimir I, who moved the dux's main residence from [[Nin, Croatia|Nin]] to Klis.<ref name="Fine 257">Fine (The early medieval Balkans&nbsp;<U+2013> 1991), p. 257.</ref>

The reign of Mislav's successor [[Trpimir I of Croatia|Trpimir I]], is significant for spreading [[Christianity]] in the medieval Croatian state, and for the first mention of the name ''"Croats"'' in domestic documents.<ref name="Curta 139">Curta (2006), p. 139.</ref><ref name="Hrvatski leksikon 1022">Hrvatski leksikon (1996), p. 1022.</ref> On 4 March, in 852, Trpimir I issued a ''"Charter in Bia<U+0107>i"'' ({{lang-la|in loco Byaci dicitur}}) in Latin, confirming Mislav's donations to the [[Archbishopric]] in [[Split (city)|Split]].<ref name="Hrvatski leksikon 1022"/> In this document Trpimir I named himself; ''"By the mercy of God, Duke of Croats"'' ({{lang-la|Dux Chroatorum iuvatus munere divino}}), and his realm as the ''"Realm of the Croats"'' ({{lang-la|Regnum Chroatorum}}).<ref name="Hrvatski leksikon 1022"/> In the same document Trpimir I mentioned Klis as his property&nbsp;<U+2014> seat.<ref name="Curta 139"/> Under Klis, in Ri<U+017E>inice, the duke Trpimir built a [[church (building)|church]] and the first [[Order of St. Benedict|Benedictine]] [[monastery]] in Croatia, which is known from the discovery of a stone fragment on a gable arch from an altar screen, inscribed with the prince's name and title.<ref name="Curta 139"/> {{cquote|([[Latin language|Latin]] ... ''pro duce Trepimero'' ...&nbsp;<U+2013> English... ''pray for the Prince Trpimir'' ...)}}

A controversial [[Saxons|Saxon]] theologian of the mid-ninth century, [[Gottschalk of Orbais]], spent some time at Trpimir's court between 846 and 848.<ref name="Curta 139"/> His work ''"De Trina deitate"'' is an important source of information for Trpimir's reign.<ref name="Curta 139"/> Gottschalk was a witness to the battle between Trpimir and Byzantine strategos, when Trpimir was victorious.<ref name="Curta 139"/> During the reign of Croatian king [[Tomislav of Croatia|Tomislav]], who had no permanent capital, the castle of Klis along with [[Biograd na Moru|Biograd]], were his chief residences.<ref name="Fine 263">Fine (The early medieval Balkans&nbsp;<U+2013> 1991), p. 263.</ref>

From the early 12th century, and after the decay of the native Croatian royal family of Trpimirovi<U+0107>, the castle of Klis was mainly governed by [[Croatian nobility]], under the supremacy of Hungarian kings. The [[Kingdom of Croatia (medieval)|Kingdom of Croatia]] and the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] were, from 1102, a [[personal union]] of two kingdoms, united under the Hungarian king.<ref group="Note">The actual nature of the relationship is inexplicable in modern terms because it varied from time to time.(Bellamy (2003), p. 38.) Sometimes Croatia acted as an independent agent and at other times as a vassal of Hungary.(Bellamy (2003), p. 38.)

From the well-fortified position in the Klis Fortress, the Turks were a constant threat to the Venetians and to the local Croatian population in the surrounding area.

===Venetian domination===
In 1420, the [[Anjou]] contender [[Ladislaus of Naples]] was defeated and forced to sail away for [[Naples]]. Upon his departure he sold his "rights" to Dalmatia to the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian Republic]] for the relatively meager sum of 100,000 [[ducats]]. However, Klis and Klis Fortress remained parts of the Kingdom of Croatia.<ref name="gra<U+0111>evinar"/> From that time, the Venetians were eager to take control over Klis, as the fortress was one of the region<U+2019>s most important strategic points.<ref name="Povijest Klisa"/>

The Venetians fought for decades before they finally managed to re-take Klis.<ref name="Povijest Klisa"/> During the [[Candian War#War in Dalmatia|Candian War (1645<U+2013>1669)]], the Venetians in Dalmatia enjoyed the support of the local population, particularly the [[Morlachs]] (Morlacchi).<ref name="Povijest Klisa"/> Venetian commander [[Leonardo Foscolo]] seized several forts, retook [[Novigrad, Zadar County|Novigrad]], temporarily captured the [[Knin Fortress]], and managed to compel the garrison of Klis Fortress to surrender. At the same time, a month-long siege of the <U+0160>ibenik Fortress by the Ottomans in August and September failed.<ref name="Fraser 244-245">Fraser (1854), pp. 244<U+2013>245.</ref><ref name="Setton 148-149">Setton (1991), pp. 148<U+2013>149.</ref>

From 1669, Klis Fortress was in the possession of the Venetians, and it remained so until the fall of the Venetian state.<ref name="Povijest Klisa"/> The Venetians restored and enlarged the fortress during their rule.<ref name="gra<U+0111>evinar"/> After another, the seventh war with the Turks from 1714 to 1718, the Venetians were able to advance up to the present Bosnian/Croatian border, taking in the whole Sinjsko field and [[Imotski]].<ref name="Singleton 60-61"/> Thereafter the Turkish menace was laid to rest and Venice had no serious challenge to its authority in Dalmatia, until [[Napoleon I|Napoleon]] extinguished the republic itself in 1797.<ref name="Singleton 60-61"/> The border between Christian and Muslim Europe had been moved further east, and the fortress lost its main strategic importance.<ref name="gra<U+0111>evinar"/> Subsequently, Klis was taken by the [[Austrians]].<ref name="Povijest Klisa"/> The last military occupation of Klis Fortress was by [[Axis powers]] during [[World War II]].<ref name="gra<U+0111>evinar"/>

Klis Fortress is one of the most valuable surviving examples of defensive [[architecture]] in Dalmatia.<ref name="gra<U+0111>evinar"/> The fortress is a remarkably comprehensive structure with three long rectangular defensive lines, consisting of three [[Defensive wall|defensive stone walls]], which are surrounding a central strongpoint, the "''Polo<U+017E>aj maggiore''" at its eastern, highest end.<ref name="Bousfield 313"/> "''Polo<U+017E>aj maggiore''" or ''"Grand position"'' is a mixed Croatian-Italian term, dating from the time when Leonardo Foscolo captured the fortress for the Venetians in 1648.<ref name="Bousfield 313"/> At that time, a village started to spread below the ramparts.<ref name="Foster 215"/> The structures of the fortress are mostly irregular, as they were constructed to suit the natural topography.<ref name="Wilkinson 169-172"/> On the hills around Klis, there are several small towers, built by the Turks to keep the fortress under surveillance.<ref name="Wilkinson 169-172"/>

===Fortress outskirts===
The Klis Fortress rises on a bare cliff divided into two parts.<ref name="gra<U+0111>evinar"/> The first, lower part is on the west, out topped by Mount Greben from the north.<ref name="gra<U+0111>evinar"/> The second, higher part is on the east, and includes the Tower "Oprah", whose name most likely refers to a specific part in the defense.<ref name="gra<U+0111>evinar"/> In this section which was not topped by any side, was located the flat of the [[Commander]].<ref name="gra<U+0111>evinar"/> The only entrance into the fortress is from the western side.<ref name="gra<U+0111>evinar"/> On the southwest side of the fortress, and bellow it was a resort (part of modern village of Klis) called "borgo" or "suburbium", surrounded by double walls with 100<U+2013>200 towers.<ref name="gra<U+0111>evinar"/> A similar but smaller resort (also part of modern village of Klis) existed below Mount Greben on a plateau called Megdan.<ref name="gra<U+0111>evinar"/> This included [[lazaretto]]es and [[quarantine]]s which were in Turkish times called "nazanama".<ref name="gra<U+0111>evinar"/> There were also many inns for travellers, which were used for isolation during epidemics.<ref name="gra<U+0111>evinar"/> Thus, the coastal towns, primarily the town of Split was protected from epidemics that came from Bosnia.<ref name="gra<U+0111>evinar"/> Near the fortress, there were several sources of drinking water, and the closest was the "[[Biblical Magi|Holy Biblical Magi]]" whose importance was invaluable during long sieges.<ref name="gra<U+0111>evinar"/>

===Present appearance===
[[File:Split at night.jpg|160px|thumb|alt=In view from the fortress towards Split at night, there is dark blue sky, and city lights below.|left|View towards [[Split (city)|Split]].]]
The fortress was built into the south face of a rocky mass, and is barely discernable from the distance as a man-made structure.<ref name="Foster 215"/> The defensive capabilities of the fortress have been tested through history in many [[military]] operations.<ref name="gra<U+0111>evinar"/> During the centuries of its use, the structure served various armies and has undergone a number of renovations, to keep up with the development of arms.<ref name="gra<U+0111>evinar"/> The original appearance of the fortress is no longer known, due to the structural changes undertaken by Croatian nobility, Turks, Venetians and Austrians.<ref name="gra<U+0111>evinar"/> The present day aspect of a mostly [[Rock (geology)|stone]] fortress dates back to the restructuring work carried out by the Venetians in the 17th century.<ref name="Foster 215">Foster (2004), p. 215.</ref>

====First defensive line====
Many buildings of the Klis Fortress which are from 17th<U+2013>19th century are partially or entirely preserved.<ref name="gra<U+0111>evinar"/> The Fortress actually consists of three parts, enclosed by walls with separate entrances.<ref name="gra<U+0111>evinar"/> The first main entrance was built by the Austrians in the early 19th century, on the place of an earlier Venetian entrance.<ref name="gra<U+0111>evinar"/> Left of the entrance there is a fortification erected by the Venetians in the early 18th century.<ref name="gra<U+0111>evinar"/> Also, near the main entrance there is a "position Avanzato" built in 1648, which was repeatedly renewed afterwards.<ref name="gra<U+0111>evinar"/> On the ground floor of the fortification there is a narrow over-vaulted corridor, which is called a Casemate.<ref name="gra<U+0111>evinar"/>

====Second defensive line====
[[File:Oprah tower and second entrance of klis fortress.jpg|160px|thumb|alt=Stone tower with flag left from stone entrance.|left|Oprah tower guarding a second entrance.]]
The second entrance which was significantly damaged in the siege of 1648, leads to the former medieval part of the fortress previously ruled by a Croatian nobility.<ref name="gra<U+0111>evinar"/> After 1648, Venetians fully restored the second entrance, but its present appearance was made by the Austrians during the early 19th century.<ref name="gra<U+0111>evinar"/> Along the northern wall near the second entrance, there is fortress-tower called "Oprah", the most important medieval fortification of the western part of the fortress.<ref name="gra<U+0111>evinar"/> It was mentioned for the first time in 1355, but later the Venetians made the lower crown on it.<ref name="gra<U+0111>evinar"/> Nearby of the entrance are artillery barracks, built by the Austrians in the first half of the 19th century.<ref name="gra<U+0111>evinar"/> In 1931 its upper floor was ruined, so now only the ground floor remains.<ref name="gra<U+0111>evinar"/>
