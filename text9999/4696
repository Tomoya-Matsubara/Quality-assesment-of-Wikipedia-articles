'''Madagascar''', officially the '''Republic of Madagascar''' ({{lang-mg|Repoblikan'i Madagasikara}} {{IPA-mg|republi<U+02C8>k<U+02B2>an mada<U+0261>as<U+02C8>k<U+02B2>ar<U+0259><U+0325>|}}; {{lang-fr|link=no|R<U+00E9>publique de Madagascar}}) and previously known as the '''[[Malagasy Republic]]''', is an [[island country]] in the [[Indian Ocean]], off the southeastern coast of [[Africa]]. The nation comprises the island of Madagascar (the fourth-largest island in the world), as well as numerous smaller peripheral islands. Following the prehistoric breakup of the supercontinent [[Gondwana]], Madagascar split from [[India]] around 88&nbsp;million years ago, allowing native plants and animals to evolve in relative isolation. Consequently, Madagascar is a [[biodiversity hotspot]]; over 90&nbsp;percent of [[wildlife of Madagascar|its wildlife]] is found nowhere else on Earth. The island's diverse ecosystems and unique wildlife are threatened by the encroachment of the rapidly growing human population.

Initial human settlement of Madagascar occurred between 350&nbsp;BCE and 550&nbsp;AD by [[Austronesian peoples]] arriving on [[outrigger canoe]]s from [[Borneo]]. These were joined around 1000&nbsp;CE by [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] migrants crossing the [[Mozambique Channel]]. Other groups continued to settle on Madagascar over time, each one making lasting contributions to Malagasy cultural life. The [[Malagasy people|Malagasy ethnic group]] is often divided into eighteen or more [[Ethnic groups of Madagascar|sub-groups]] of which the largest are the [[Merina people|Merina]] of the central highlands.

Until the late 18th century, the island of Madagascar was ruled by a fragmented assortment of shifting socio-political alliances. Beginning in the early 19th century, most of the island was united and ruled as the [[Merina Kingdom|Kingdom of Madagascar]] by a [[List of Malagasy monarchs|series]] of Merina [[andriana|nobles]]. The monarchy collapsed in 1897 when the island was absorbed into the [[French colonial empire]], from which the island gained independence in 1960. The autonomous state of Madagascar has since undergone four major constitutional periods, termed Republics. Since 1992 the nation has officially been governed as a constitutional democracy from its capital at [[Antananarivo]]. However, in a [[2009 Malagasy political crisis|popular uprising in 2009]] the last elected president [[Marc Ravalomanana]] was made to resign and presidential power was transferred in March 2009 to [[Andry Rajoelina]] in a move widely viewed by the international community as a ''[[coup d'<U+00E9>tat]]''. 

In 2012, the population of Madagascar was estimated at just over 22&nbsp;million, 90&nbsp;percent of whom live on less than two dollars per day. [[Malagasy language|Malagasy]] and [[French language|French]] are both [[official language]]s of the state. The majority of the population adheres to [[Malagasy mythology|traditional beliefs]], [[Christianity in Madagascar|Christianity]], or an amalgamation of both. Ecotourism and agriculture, paired with greater investments in education, health and private enterprise, are key elements of Madagascar's development strategy. Under Ravalomanana these investments produced substantial economic growth but the benefits were not evenly spread throughout the population, producing tensions over the increasing cost of living and declining living standards among the poor and some segments of the middle class.

==Etymology==
In the [[Malagasy language]], the island of Madagascar is called ''Madagasikara'' {{IPA-mg|mada<U+0261>as<U+02B2><U+02C8>k<U+02B2>ar<U+0259><U+0325>|}} and its people are referred to as ''[[Malagasy people|Malagasy]]''.<ref name=NatGeo1>{{cite web | last = National Geographic | title = Style Manual | url=http://stylemanual.ngs.org/home/M/madagascan-malagasy |archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/6053JX6vh  | archivedate = 31 August 2012 | accessdate =31 August 2012}}</ref> The island's appellation "Madagascar" is not of local origin but rather was popularized in the [[Middle Ages]] by Europeans.<ref name=Cousins>Cousins (1895), pp. 11<U+2013>12</ref> The name ''Madageiscar'' was first recorded in the memoirs of 13th-century Venetian explorer [[Marco Polo]] as a corrupted form of the name [[Mogadishu]], the [[Somalia|Somali]] port with which Polo had confused the island. On [[Lawrence of Rome|St. Laurence]]'s Day in 1500, Portuguese explorer [[Diogo Dias]] landed on the island and christened it ''S<U+00E3>o Louren<U+00E7>o'', but Polo's name was preferred and popularized on [[Renaissance]] maps. No single Malagasy-language name predating ''Madagasikara'' appears to have been used by the local population to refer to the island, although some communities had their own name for part or all of the land they inhabited.<ref>Room (2006), p. 230</ref>

The combination of southeastern [[trade winds]] and northwestern [[monsoons]] produces a hot rainy season (November<U+2013>April) with frequently destructive [[cyclones]], and a relatively cooler dry season (May<U+2013>October). Rain clouds originating over the Indian Ocean discharge much of their moisture over the island's eastern coast; the heavy precipitation supports the area's [[rain forest]] ecosystem. The central highlands are both drier and cooler while the west is drier still, and a [[semi-arid climate]] prevails in the southwest and southern interior of the island.<ref name=endemicstats/> [[Tropical cyclone]]s annually cause damage to infrastructure and local economies as well as loss of life.<ref name="LOC">{{cite web| last = Metz | first = Helen Chapin |year = 1994 | title = Library of Congress Country Studies: Madagascar | url=http://countrystudies.us/madagascar/ | accessdate =1 February 2011 |archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/64jOW1dDD |archivedate = 1 February 2011}}</ref> In 2004 [[Cyclone Gafilo]] became the strongest cyclone ever recorded to hit Madagascar.

Habitat destruction and hunting have threatened many of Madagascar's endemic species or driven them to extinction.

==History==
{{Main|History of Madagascar}}

===Early period===
[[File:Malagasy girls Madagascar Merina.jpg|thumb|[[Malagasy people|Malagasy]] ancestry reflects a blend of Austronesian (Southeast Asian) and Bantu (East African) roots.]]
Some archaeologists estimate that the earliest settlers arrived in successive waves throughout the period between 350&nbsp;BCE and 550&nbsp;CE, while others are cautious about dates earlier than AD420 (AD250-590, 2 standard deviations) which is the date for the unambiguously earliest human presence, at Andavakoera.<ref>'The archaeological evidence for the earliest human presence in Madagascar comes from Andavakoera near Diego Suarez and is dated to AD420 (AD250-590, 2SDs) (Dewar & Wright 1993). There is some indirect evidence for earlier human presence, but it is ambiguous. The oldest such potential evidence to our knowledge is cutmarked subfossil lemur bone from a palaeontological site, Taolambiby, in the southwest. One date was obtained, calibrated as 530BC to 300BC (Godfrey & Jungers 2003). The cutmarking looks plausible, but there is a potential problem of old carbon from the limestone landscape compromising the date, and there are no associated artefacts or archaeological sites in the vicinity. Nearly contemporaneous potential evidence comes from ''Cannabis/Humulus'' pollen which occurs in a pollen column from the central highlands at an interpolated date of c. 2200BP (Burney 1987). There is some suspicion however that cannabis may have reached Africa 3000 years ago, and in any case, there is no archaeological evidence for human occupation in the highlands until c. AD1200. Finally, a cutmarked pygmy hippo bone from Ambolisatra has been dated and calibrated to between 60BC and AD130 (2 SDs), but it is from a coastal swamp without indications of settlement, in a heavily karstic region. Moreover, a similar bone from the same collection from a nearby site gave two widely divergent dates of 2020BP and 3495BP (MacPhee & Burney 1991). Transient visits to Madagascar that did not result in enduring settlement cannot be ruled out, and may have left some traces.'

Madagascar was an important transoceanic trading hub connecting ports of the Indian Ocean in the early centuries following human settlement. The written history of Madagascar began with the Arabs, who established trading posts along the northwest coast by at least the 10th century and introduced Islam, the Arabic script (used to transcribe the Malagasy language in a form of writing known as ''[[sorabe]]''), Arab astrology and other cultural elements.<ref name="LOC" /> European contact began in 1500, when the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] sea captain [[Diogo Dias]] sighted the island.<ref name=BGNote/> The French established trading posts along the east coast in the late 17th century.<ref name="LOC" />

From about 1774 to 1824, Madagascar gained prominence among pirates and European traders, particularly those involved in the [[Atlantic slave trade|trans-Atlantic slave trade]]. The small island of [[<U+00CE>le Sainte-Marie|Nosy Boroha]] off the northeastern coast of Madagascar has been proposed by some historians as the site of the legendary pirate utopia of [[Libertalia]].<ref>Oliver (1886), p. 16</ref> Many European sailors were shipwrecked on the coasts of the island, among them [[Robert Drury (sailor)|Robert Drury]], whose journal is one of the few written depictions of life in southern Madagascar during the 18th century.<ref>Kent (1976), pp.&nbsp;65<U+2013>71</ref> The wealth generated by maritime trade spurred the rise of organized kingdoms on the island, some of which had grown quite powerful by the 17th century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/madg_1/hd_madg_1.htm |archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/604iN3JCP |archivedate = 10 July 2011 |title=Kingdoms of Madagascar: Maroserana and Merina |publisher=Metmuseum.org |accessdate=25 April 2010}}</ref> Among these were the [[Betsimisaraka people|Betsimisaraka]] alliance of the eastern coast and the [[Sakalava]] chiefdoms of [[Menabe]] and [[Boina Kingdom|Boina]] on the west coast. The Kingdom of Imerina, located in the central highlands with its capital at the [[Rova of Antananarivo|royal palace]] of Antananarivo, emerged at around the same time under the leadership of King Andriamanelo.<ref name="Ogot">Ogot (1992), p. 418</ref>

===Kingdom of Madagascar===

[[File:Andrianampoinimerina.jpg|thumb|upright|right|King [[Andrianampoinimerina]] (1787<U+2013>1810)]]
Upon its emergence in the early 17th century, the highland kingdom of Imerina was initially a minor power relative to the larger coastal kingdoms<ref name="Ogot" /> and grew even weaker in the early 18th century when King [[Andriamasinavalona]] divided it among his four sons. Following a century of warring and famine, Imerina was reunited in 1793 by King [[Andrianampoinimerina]] (1787<U+2013>1810).<ref name="Hodder">Hodder (1982), p. 59</ref> From his initial capital [[Ambohimanga]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/950 |title=Royal Hill of Ambohimanga |publisher=[[UNESCO]] |accessdate=30 April 2011|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/604iRR1dZ|archivedate = 10 July 2011}}</ref> and later from the [[Rova of Antananarivo]], this Merina king rapidly expanded his rule over neighboring principalities. His ambition to bring the entire island under his control was largely achieved by his son and successor, King [[Radama I]] (1810<U+2013>28), who was recognized by the British government as King of Madagascar. Radama concluded a treaty in 1817 with the British governor of [[Mauritius]] to abolish the lucrative slave trade in return for British military and financial assistance. Artisan missionary envoys from the [[London Missionary Society]] began arriving in 1818 and included such key figures as [[James Cameron (missionary)|James Cameron]], [[David Jones (missionary)|David Jones]] and [[David Griffiths (missionary)|David Griffiths]], who established schools, transcribed the [[Malagasy language]] using the [[Latin alphabet|Roman alphabet]], translated the Bible, and introduced a variety of new technologies to the island.<ref>Ade Ajayi (1998), pp.&nbsp;413<U+2013>422</ref>

Radama's successor, Queen [[Ranavalona I]] (1828<U+2013>61), responded to increasing political and cultural encroachment on the part of Britain and France by issuing a royal edict prohibiting the practice of [[Christianity in Madagascar]] and pressuring most foreigners to leave the territory. Among those who continued to reside in Imerina were [[Jean Laborde]], an entrepreneur who developed munitions and other industries on behalf of the monarchy, and [[Joseph-Fran<U+00E7>ois Lambert]], a French adventurer and slave trader, with whom then-Prince [[Radama II]] signed a controversial trade agreement termed the Lambert Charter. Succeeding his mother, Radama II (1861<U+2013>63) attempted to relax the queen's stringent policies, but was [[Radama II#Assassination plot|overthrown]] two years later by Prime Minister [[Rainivoninahitriniony]] (1852<U+2013>1865) and an alliance of ''[[Andriana]]'' (noble) and ''[[Hova (Madagascar)|Hova]]'' (commoner) courtiers, who sought to end the absolute power of the monarch.<ref name="LOC" /> Following the coup, the courtiers offered Radama's queen [[Rasoherina]] (1863<U+2013>68) the opportunity to rule, if she would accept a power sharing arrangement with the Prime Minister<U+2014>a new social contract that would be sealed by a political marriage between them.<ref>Oliver (1886), pp. 124<U+2013>126</ref> Queen Rasoherina accepted, first wedding Rainivoninahitriniony, then later deposing him and wedding his brother, Prime Minister [[Rainilaiarivony]] (1864<U+2013>95), who would go on to marry Queen [[Ranavalona II]] (1868<U+2013>83) and Queen [[Ranavalona III]] (1883<U+2013>97) in succession.<ref>Uwechue (1981), p. 473</ref>

Over the course of Rainilaiarivony's 31-year tenure as prime minister, numerous policies were adopted to modernize and consolidate the power of the central government.<ref name=TA910/> Schools were constructed throughout the island and attendance was made mandatory. Army organization was improved, and British consultants were employed to train and professionalize soldiers.<ref name=FFO522>Fage, Flint & Oliver (1986), pp. 522<U+2013>524</ref> [[Polygamy]] was outlawed and Christianity, declared the official religion of the court in 1869, was adopted alongside traditional beliefs among a growing portion of the populace.<ref name=TA910>Thompson & Adloff (1965), pp. 9<U+2013>10</ref> Legal codes were reformed on the basis of British [[common law]] and three European-style courts were established in the capital city.<ref name=FFO522/> In his joint role as Commander-in-Chief, Rainilaiarivony also successfully ensured the defense of Madagascar against several French colonial incursions.<ref name=FFO522/>

===French colonization===

To force capitulation, the French bombarded and occupied the harbor of [[Toamasina]] on the east coast, and [[Mahajanga]] on the west coast, in December 1894 and January 1895 respectively.<ref name=Disease>Curtin (1998), p. 186</ref> A French military [[flying column]] then marched toward Antananarivo, losing many men to malaria and other diseases. Reinforcements came from [[Algeria]] and [[Sub-Saharan Africa]].

===Independent state===

Since regaining independence, Madagascar has transitioned through four republics with corresponding revisions to its constitution. The [[Malagasy Republic|First Republic]] (1960<U+2013>72), under the leadership of French-appointed President [[Philibert Tsiranana]], was characterized by a continuation of strong economic and political ties to France. Many high-level technical positions were filled by French expatriates, and French teachers, textbooks and curricula continued to be used in schools around the country. Popular resentment over Tsiranana's tolerance for this "neo-colonial" arrangement inspired a series of student protests that overturned his administration in 1972.<ref name="LOC" />

[[Gabriel Ramanantsoa]], a Major General in the army, was appointed interim President and Prime Minister that same year, but low public approval forced him to step down in 1975. Colonel [[Richard Ratsimandrava]], appointed to succeed him, was assassinated six days into his tenure. General [[Gilles Andriamahazo]] ruled after Ratsimandrava for four months before being replaced by another military appointee: Vice Admiral [[Didier Ratsiraka]], who ushered in the socialist-Marxist [[Democratic Republic of Madagascar|Second Republic]] that ran under his tenure from 1975 to 1993. This period saw a political alignment with the [[Eastern Bloc]] countries and a shift toward economic insularity. These policies, coupled with economic pressures stemming from the [[1973 oil crisis]], resulted in the rapid collapse of Madagascar's economy and a sharp decline in living standards,<ref name="LOC" /> and the country had become completely bankrupt by 1979. The Ratsiraka administration accepted the conditions of transparency, anti-corruption measures and free market policies imposed by the International Monetary Fund, World Bank and various bilateral donors in exchange for their bailout of the nation's broken economy.<ref name=ISS/>

Ratsiraka's dwindling popularity in the late 1980s reached a critical point in 1991 when presidential guards opened fire on unarmed protesters during a rally. Within two months, a transitional government had been established under the leadership of [[Albert Zafy]] (1993<U+2013>96), who went on to win the 1992 presidential elections and inaugurate the [[Third Republic of Madagascar|Third Republic]] (1992<U+2013>2010).<ref name="crisisgroup" /> The new [[constitution of Madagascar|Madagascar constitution]] established a multi-party democracy and a separation of powers that placed significant control in the hands of the National Assembly.  The new constitution also emphasized human rights, social and political freedoms, and free trade.<ref name="LOC" /> Zafy's term, however, was marred by economic decline, allegations of corruption, and his introduction of legislation to give himself greater powers. He was consequently impeached in 1996, and an interim president, [[Norbert Ratsirahonana]], was appointed for the three months prior to the next presidential election. Ratsiraka was then voted back into power on a platform of decentralization and economic reforms for a second term which lasted from 1996 to 2001.<ref name=ISS>{{cite journal | last = Marcus | first = Richard | title = Political change in Madagascar: populist democracy or neopatrimonialism by another name? | issue = Occasional Paper no. 89 | publisher = Institute for Security Studies | date = August 2004 | url = http://www.iss.org.za/pubs/papers/89/Paper89.htm | accessdate =15 February 2012}}</ref>

The contested [[Malagasy presidential election, 2001|2001 presidential elections]] in which then-mayor of Antananarivo, Marc Ravalomanana, eventually emerged victorious, caused a seven-month standoff in 2002 between supporters of Ravalomanana and Ratsiraka. The negative economic impact of the political crisis was gradually overcome by Ravalomanana's progressive economic and political policies, which encouraged investments in education and ecotourism, facilitated foreign direct investment, and cultivated trading partnerships both regionally and internationally. National GDP grew at an average rate of 7&nbsp;percent per year under his administration. In the later half of his second term, Ravalomanana was criticised by domestic and international observers who accused him of increasing authoritarianism and corruption.<ref name=ISS/>

Opposition leader and then-mayor of Antananarivo, Andry Rajoelina, led a [[2009 Malagasy political crisis|movement in early 2009]] in which Ravalomanana was pushed from power in an unconstitutional process widely condemned as a ''coup d'<U+00E9>tat''. In March 2009, Rajoelina was declared by the Supreme Court as the President of the [[High Transitional Authority]], an interim governing body responsible for moving the country toward presidential elections. In 2010, a new constitution was [[Malagasy constitutional referendum, 2010|adopted by referendum]], establishing a Fourth Republic, which sustained the democratic, multi-party structure established in the previous constitution.<ref name="crisisgroup" /> The first round of the [[Malagasy general election, 2013|2013 presidential election]] was held on 25 October 2013 with parliamentary elections and a second presidential round scheduled on 20 December 2013.<ref name = October>{{cite web |last = Ilioniania | first = Alain | title = Madagascar pushes back presidential election to October |work = Reuters | url = http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/08/22/us-madagascar-elections-idUSBRE97L0YE20130822 | date = 22 August 2013 | accessdate = 1 September 2013 }}</ref>

==Government==

===Structure===
{{Main|Government of Madagascar|Antananarivo}}
[[File:Antananarivo06.jpg|thumb|[[Antananarivo]] is the political and economic capital of Madagascar.]]
Madagascar is a [[semi-presidential system|semi-presidential]] [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[Diversity (politics)|multi-party]] republic, wherein the popularly elected president is the head of state and selects a [[Prime Minister of Madagascar|prime minister]], who recommends candidates to the president to form his cabinet of ministers. According to the [[Constitution of Madagascar|constitution]], executive power is exercised by the government while legislative power is vested in the ministerial cabinet, the [[Senate of Madagascar|Senate]] and the [[National Assembly of Madagascar|National Assembly]], although in reality these two latter bodies have very little power or legislative role. The constitution establishes independent executive, legislative and judicial branches and mandates a popularly elected president limited to three five-year terms.<ref name=BGNote/>

The last presidential election was held on 3 December 2006 and resulted in the re-election of Marc Ravalomanana, from whom executive power was unconstitutionally transferred to Andry Rajoelina in March 2009. There is currently no legitimately elected head of state in Madagascar. The public also elects the 127 members of the National Assembly to five-year terms. The last National Assembly election was held on 23 September 2007. All 33 members of the Senate serve six-year terms, with 22 senators elected by local officials and 11 appointed by the president. After taking power, Rajoelina dissolved both the National Assembly and the Senate, leaving the nation without a constitutional legislative body.<ref name=BGNote/> At the local level, the island's 22 provinces are administered by a governor and provincial council. Provinces are further sub-divided into regions and communes. The judiciary is modeled on the French system, with a High Constitutional Court, High Court of Justice, Supreme Court, Court of Appeals, criminal tribunals, and tribunals of first instance.<ref name=justiceMada>Nalla (2010), pp. 122<U+2013>128</ref> The courts, which adhere to [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]], lack the capacity to quickly and transparently try the cases in the judicial system, often forcing defendants to pass lengthy pretrial detentions in unsanitary and overcrowded prisons.<ref name=mediainfo/>

Antananarivo is the administrative capital and largest city of Madagascar.<ref name=BGNote/> It is located in the highlands region, near the geographic center of the island. King Andrianjaka founded Antananarivo as the capital of his Imerina Kingdom around 1610 or 1625 upon the site of a captured Vazimba capital on the hilltop of [[Twelve sacred hills of Imerina#Hill of Analamanga|Analamanga]].<ref name=vazimbadjp/> As Merina dominance expanded over neighboring Malagasy peoples in the early 19th century to establish the Kingdom of Madagascar, Antananarivo became the center of administration for virtually the entire island. In 1896 the French colonizers of Madagascar adopted the Merina capital as their center of colonial administration. The city remained the capital of Madagascar after regaining independence in 1960. In 2011, the capital's population was estimated at 1,300,000 inhabitants. The next largest cities are [[Antsirabe]] (500,000), [[Toamasina]] (450,000) and [[Mahajanga]] (400,000).<ref name=BGNote/>

===Politics===
{{Main|Politics of Madagascar|Foreign relations of Madagascar|Human rights in Madagascar}}
Since Madagascar gained independence from France in 1960, the island's political transitions have been marked by numerous popular protests, several disputed elections, an impeachment, two military coups and one assassination. The island's recurrent political crises are often prolonged, with detrimental effects on the local economy, international relations and Malagasy living standards. The eight-month standoff between incumbent Ratsiraka and challenger Marc Ravalomanana, following the 2001 presidential elections, cost Madagascar millions of dollars in lost tourism and trade revenue as well as damage to infrastructure, such as bombed bridges and buildings damaged by arson.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irinnews.org/report.aspx?reportid=47721 |archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/604iepG98 |archivedate = 10 July 2011|title=MADAGASCAR: Former president sentenced to five years in prison |publisher=Irinnews.org |date= 17 December 2003 |accessdate=25 April 2010}}</ref> [[2009 Malagasy protests|A series of protests]] led by Andry Rajoelina against Ravalomanana in early 2009 became violent, with more than 170 people killed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=83838 |archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/604j587uf |archivedate = 10 July 2011 |title=Madagascar: Appeal launched despite political uncertainty |publisher=Irinnews.org |date= 7 April 2009 |accessdate=25 April 2010}}</ref> The installation of Rajoelina's [[High Transitional Authority|transitional regime]] has, since March 2009, caused many bilateral donors and intergovernmental organizations to freeze aid and suspend regular diplomatic relations with Madagascar, causing economic development to stagnate and reversing many of the gains achieved under the previous administration. In addition, modern politics in Madagascar are colored by the history of Merina subjugation of coastal communities under their rule in the 19th century. The consequent tension between the highland and coastal populations has periodically flared up into isolated events of violence.<ref name=ethnicstrife>{{cite news | last = Leithead | first = Alastair | title = Ethnic strife rocks Madagascar |newspaper=BBC News | date = 14 May 2002 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/1987383.stm |archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/64rGphWDh | archivedate = 22 January 2012 | accessdate =22 January 2012}}</ref>

Madagascar has historically been perceived as being on the margin of mainstream African affairs despite being a founding member of the [[Organisation of African Unity]], which was established in 1963 and dissolved in 2002 to be replaced by the [[African Union]]. Madagascar was not permitted to attend the first African Union summit because of a dispute over the results of the 2001 presidential election, but rejoined the African Union in July 2003 after a 14-month hiatus. However, Madagascar was again suspended by the African Union in March 2009 following the [[2009 Malagasy political crisis|unconstitutional transfer of executive power]] to Rajoelina.<ref>{{cite news | title = Pressure grows on Madagascar coup |publisher=BBC News | date = 20 March 2009 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7954356.stm |archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/604XDz2yB |archivedate = 10 July 2011 | accessdate =30 March 2009}}</ref> Madagascar is a member of the [[International Criminal Court]] with a Bilateral Immunity Agreement of protection for the [[United States military]].<ref name=BGNote/> [[List of diplomatic missions of Madagascar|Eleven countries]] have established embassies in Madagascar, including France, the United Kingdom, the United States, China and India.<ref>{{cite web | title = Num<U+00E9>ros utiles | publisher = AirMadagascar.com | date = 28 January 2012 | url = http://www.webcitation.org/651QcKNqa | accessdate =28 January 2012 |archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/651QcKNqa |archivedate = 28 January 2012}} {{fr}}</ref>

Human rights in Madagascar are protected under the constitution and the state is a signatory to numerous international agreements including the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]].<ref name=DOS/> Religious, ethnic and sexual minorities are protected under the law.

===Security===
{{Main|Military of Madagascar}}
The rise of centralized kingdoms among the Sakalava, Merina and other ethnic groups produced the island's first standing armies by the 16th century, initially equipped with spears but later with muskets, cannon and other firearms.<ref>Barendse (2002), pp. 259<U+2013>274</ref> By the early 19th century, the Merina sovereigns of the Kingdom of Madagascar had brought much of the island under their control by mobilizing an army of trained and armed soldiers numbering as high as 30,000.<ref name="army">Freeman & Johns (1840), p. 25</ref> French attacks on coastal towns in the later part of the century prompted then-Prime Minister Rainilaiarivony to solicit British assistance to provide training to the Merina monarchy's army. Despite the training and leadership provided by British military advisers, the Malagasy army was unable to withstand French weaponry and was forced to surrender following an attack on the royal palace at Antananarivo. Madagascar was declared a colony of France in 1897.<ref>Chapus & Mondain (1953), p. 377</ref>

The political independence and sovereignty of the Malagasy armed forces, which comprises an army, navy and air force, was restored with independence from France in 1960.<ref>{{cite web | title = The Military Balance 2010 | publisher = [[International Institute of Strategic Studies]] | pages = 314<U+2013>315, 467 | url = http://moorishwanderer.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/2010_report.pdf | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5xceWrXPC |archivedate = 1 April 2011 | accessdate =1 April 2011}}</ref> Since this time the Malagasy military has never engaged in armed conflict with another state or within its own borders, but has occasionally intervened to restore order during periods of political unrest. Under the socialist Second Republic, Admiral Didier Ratsiraka instated mandatory national armed or civil service for all young citizens regardless of gender, a policy that remained in effect from 1976 to 1991.<ref>Sharp (2002), p. 87</ref><ref>Strakes (2006), p. 86</ref> The armed forces are under the direction of the Minister of the Interior<ref name=justiceMada/> and have remained largely neutral during times of political crisis, as during the protracted standoff between incumbent Ratsiraka and challenger Marc Ravalomanana in the disputed 2001 presidential elections, when the military refused to intervene in favor of either candidate. This tradition was broken in 2009, when a segment of the army defected to the side of Andry Rajoelina, then-mayor of Antananarivo, in support of his attempt to force President Ravalomanana from power.<ref name=CrossroadsMarcus/>

The Minister of the Interior is responsible for the national police force, paramilitary force (''gendarmerie'') and the secret police.<ref name=justiceMada/> The police and gendarmerie are stationed and administered at the local level. However, in 2009 fewer than a third of all communes had access to the services of these security forces, with most lacking local-level headquarters for either corps.<ref name=INSTAT/> Traditional community tribunals, called ''dina'', are presided over by elders and other respected figures and remain a key means by which justice is served in rural areas where state presence is weak. Historically, security has been relatively high across the island.<ref name=CrossroadsMarcus/> Violent crime rates are low, and criminal activities are predominantly crimes of opportunity such as pickpocketing and petty theft, although child prostitution, human trafficking and the production and sale of marijuana and other illegal drugs are increasing.<ref name=justiceMada/> Budget cuts since 2009 have severely impacted the national police force, producing a steep increase in criminal activity in recent years.<ref name=CrossroadsMarcus/>

{{Main|Economy of Madagascar|Tourism in Madagascar}}
[[File:NappesNosyKomba.JPG|thumb|right|alt = embroidered tablecloths hang on lines from palm trees|Embroidered table cloths are produced for sale to tourists at Nosy Komba.]]
During Madagascar's First Republic, France heavily influenced Madagascar's economic planning and policy and served as its key trading partner. Key products were cultivated and distributed nationally through producers' and consumers' cooperatives. Government initiatives such as a rural development program and state farms were established to boost production of commodities such as rice, coffee, cattle, silk and palm oil. Popular dissatisfaction over these policies was a key factor in launching the socialist-Marxist Second Republic, in which the formerly private bank and insurance industries were nationalized; state monopolies were established for such industries as textiles, cotton and power; and import<U+2013>export trade and shipping were brought under state control. Madagascar's economy quickly deteriorated as exports fell, industrial production dropped by 75&nbsp;percent, inflation spiked and government debt increased; the rural population was soon reduced to living at subsistence levels. Over 50&nbsp;percent of the nation's export revenue was spent on debt servicing.<ref name=EBLand/>

The IMF forced Madagascar's government to accept structural adjustment policies and liberalization of the economy when the state became bankrupt in 1982 and state-controlled industries were gradually privatized over the course of the 1980s. The political crisis of 1991 led to the suspension of IMF and World Bank assistance. Conditions for the resumption of aid were not met under Zafy, who tried unsuccessfully to attract other forms of revenue for the State before aid was once again resumed under the interim government established upon Zafy's impeachment. The IMF agreed to write off half Madagascar's debt in 2004 under the Ravalomanana administration. Having met a set of stringent economic, governance and human rights criteria, Madagascar became the first country to benefit from the [[Millennium Challenge Account]] in 2005.<ref name=BGNote/>

Madagascar's GDP in 2009 was estimated at 8.6 billion USD, with a per capita GDP of $438.<ref name=BGNote/> Approximately 69&nbsp;percent of the population lives below the national poverty line threshold of one dollar per day.<ref>{{cite web | title = Madagascar at a glance |publisher = World Bank | date = 25 February 2011 | url =  http://devdata.worldbank.org/AAG/mdg_aag.pdf |archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/65E3A2dF3 | archivedate = 4 February 2012 | accessdate =4 February 2012}}</ref> The agriculture sector constituted 29&nbsp;percent of Malagasy GDP in 2011, while manufacturing formed 15&nbsp;percent of GDP.

===Natural resources and trade===
[[File:Raffia animals created by artisans in Madagascar.jpg|thumb|Toy animals made from [[raffia]], a native palm<ref>Rodd & Stackhouse (2008), p. 246</ref>]]
Madagascar's natural resources include a variety of unprocessed agricultural and mineral resources. Agriculture, including [[raffia]], fishing and [[forestry]], is a mainstay of the economy.

[[File:Antananarivo Madagascar people reading news.JPG|thumb|News stand in Antananarivo]]
In 2010, Madagascar had approximately {{Convert|7,617|km|mi|-1|abbr=on}} of paved roads, {{Convert|854|km|mi|-1|abbr=on}} of railways and {{Convert|432|km|mi|-1|abbr=on}} of navigable waterways.<ref name="Bradtp2" /> The majority of roads in Madagascar are unpaved, with many becoming impassable in the rainy season. Largely paved national routes connect the six largest regional towns to Antananarivo, with minor paved and unpaved routes providing access to other population centers in each district. There are several rail lines on the island. Antananarivo is connected to Toamasina, Ambatondrazaka and Antsirabe by rail, and another rail line connects Fianarantsoa to Manakara. The most important seaport in Madagascar is located on the east coast at Toamasina. Ports at Mahajanga and Antsiranana are significantly less used due to their remoteness.<ref name="LOC" /> The island's newest port at Ehoala, constructed in 2008 and privately managed by Rio Tinto, will come under state control upon completion of the company's mining project near T<U+00F4>lanaro around 2038.<ref name = RioTinto/> Air Madagascar services the island's many small regional airports, which offer the only practical means of access to many of the more remote regions during rainy season road washouts.<ref name="LOC" />

Running water and electricity are supplied at the national level by a government service provider, [[Jirama]], which is unable to service the entire population. As of 2009, only 6.8&nbsp;percent of Madagascar's ''fokontany'' had access to water provided by Jirama, while 9.5&nbsp;percent had access to its electricity services.<ref name=INSTAT/> 56% of Madagascar's power is provided by hydroelectric power plants with the remaining 44% provided by diesel engine generators.<ref>{{cite web | title = Production Electricit<U+00E9> | publisher = Jirama | year = 2011  | url =http://www.jirama.mg/index.php?w=scripts&f=Jirama-page.php&act=pdcelec | accessdate = 28 August 2013 |language = French}}</ref> Mobile telephone and internet access are widespread in urban areas but remain limited in rural parts of the island. Approximately 30&nbsp;percent of the districts are able to access the nations' several private telecommunications networks via mobile telephones or land lines.<ref name=INSTAT/>

Radio broadcasts remain the principal means by which the Malagasy population access international, national and local news. Only state radio broadcasts are transmitted across the entire island. Hundreds of public and private stations with local or regional range provide alternatives to state broadcasting.<ref name=mediainfo/> In addition to the state television channel, a variety of privately owned television stations broadcast local and international programming throughout Madagascar.

==Health==
[[File:Madagascar woman with child.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Maternal mortality declined between 1990 and 2009, but has since risen sharply due to the ongoing political crisis.<ref name=INSTAT/>]]
Medical centers, dispensaries and hospitals are found throughout the island, although they are concentrated in urban areas and particularly in Antananarivo. Access to medical care remains beyond the reach of many Malagasy. In addition to the high expense of medical care relative to the average Malagasy income, the prevalence of trained medical professionals remains extremely low. In 2010 Madagascar had an average of three hospital beds per 10,000&nbsp;people and a total of 3,150&nbsp;doctors, 5,661&nbsp;nurses, 385&nbsp;community health workers, 175&nbsp;pharmacists and 57&nbsp;dentists for a population of 22&nbsp;million. 14.6&nbsp;percent of government spending in 2008 was directed toward the health sector. Approximately 70&nbsp;percent of spending on health was contributed by the government, while 30&nbsp;percent originated with international donors and other private sources.<ref name=WHO2011/> The government provides at least one basic health center per commune. Private health centers are concentrated within urban areas and particularly those of the central highlands.<ref name=INSTAT/>

Despite these barriers to access, health services have shown a trend toward improvement over the past twenty years. Child immunizations against such diseases as [[hepatitis B]], [[diphtheria]] and [[measles]] increased an average of 60&nbsp;percent in this period, indicating low but increasing availability of basic medical services and treatments. The Malagasy fertility rate in 2009 was 4.6&nbsp;children per woman, declining from 6.3 in 1990. Teen pregnancy rates of 14.8&nbsp;percent in 2011, much higher than the African average, are a contributing factor to rapid population growth.<ref name=WHO2011>{{cite book | title = World Health Statistics 2011 | publisher = World Health Organization | year = 2011 | location = Paris | url = http://www.unfpa.org/sowmy/resources/docs/main_report/en_SOWMR_Full.pdf | isbn = 978-92-4-156419-9 | accessdate =21 January 2012| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/64qsWUjYm | archivedate = 21 January 2012 }}</ref> In 2010 the maternal mortality rate was 440 per 100,000 births, compared to 373.1 in 2008 and 484.4 in 1990, indicating a decline in perinatal care following the 2009 coup.

Prior to the 19th century, all education in Madagascar was informal and typically served to teach practical skills as well as social and cultural values, including respect for ancestors and elders.<ref name="LOC" /> The first formal European-style school was established in 1818 at [[Toamasina]] by members of the [[London Missionary Society]] (LMS). The LMS was invited by King Radama I (1810<U+2013>28) to expand its schools throughout Imerina to teach basic literacy and numeracy to aristocratic children. The schools were closed by Ranavalona I in 1835<ref name="Ralibera">Ralibera (1993), p. 196</ref> but reopened and expanded in the decades after her death. By the end of the 19th century Madagascar had the most developed and modern school system in pre-colonial Sub-Saharan Africa. Access to schooling was expanded in coastal areas during the colonial period, with French language and basic work skills becoming the focus of the curriculum. During the post-colonial First Republic, a continued reliance on French nationals as teachers, and French as the language of instruction, displeased those desiring a complete separation from the former colonial power.<ref name="LOC" /> Consequently, under the socialist Second Republic, French instructors and other nationals were expelled, Malagasy was declared the language of instruction and a large cadre of young Malagasy were rapidly trained to teach at remote rural schools under the mandatory two-year national service policy.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Ranaivoson | first = Samuel| title = La formation du personnel enseignant de l'<U+00E9>ducation de base <U+00E0> Madagascar: Une etude de cas.

[[Chinese people in Madagascar|Chinese]], [[Indians in Madagascar|Indian]] and [[Comoros|Comorian]] minorities are present in Madagascar, as well as a small European (primarily French) populace. Emigration in the late 20th century has reduced these minority populations, occasionally in abrupt waves, such as the exodus of [[Comoros|Comorans]] in 1976, following anti-Comoran riots in Mahajanga.<ref name="LOC" /> By comparison, there has been no significant emigration of Malagasy peoples.<ref name=EBLand/> The number of Europeans has declined since independence, reduced from 68,430 in 1958<ref name="Kitchen 1962, p. 256"/> to 17,000 three decades later.

===Language===
{{Main|Malagasy language|Languages of Madagascar}}
The Malagasy language is of [[Malayo-Polynesian]] origin and is generally spoken throughout the island. The numerous dialects of Malagasy, which are generally mutually intelligible,<ref>Rajaonarimanana (2001), p. 8</ref> can be clustered under one of two sub-groups: eastern Malagasy, spoken along the eastern forests and highlands including the Merina dialect of Antananarivo; and western Malagasy, spoken across the western coastal plains.  French became the official language during the colonial period, when Madagascar came under the authority of France. In the first national Constitution of 1958, Malagasy and French were named the official languages of the Malagasy Republic. Madagascar is a [[francophone]] country, and French is spoken among the educated population.<ref name="LOC" />

No official languages were recorded in the Constitution of 1992, although Malagasy was identified as the national language. Nonetheless, many sources still claimed that Malagasy and French were official languages, eventually leading a citizen to initiate a legal case against the state in April 2000, on the grounds that the publication of official documents only in the French language was unconstitutional. The High Constitutional Court observed in its decision that, in the absence of a language law, French still had the character of an official language.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.saflii.org/mg/cases/MGHCC/2000/1.html |archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/604mI1Vre |archivedate = 10 July 2011 |title=Haute Cour Constitutionnelle De Madagascar, D<U+00E9>cision n<U+00B0>03-HCC/D2 Du 12 avril 2000 |publisher=Saflii.org |date=12 April 2000 |accessdate=25 April 2010 }} {{fr}}</ref> In the Constitution of 2007, Malagasy remained the national language while official languages were reintroduced: Malagasy, French, and English.<ref>{{cite web | title = Madagascar: 2007 Constitutional referendum | publisher = Electoral Institute for the Sustainability of Democracy in Africa | date = June 2010 | url = http://www.eisa.org.za/WEP/mad2007results.htm |archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/64rImMRzV |archivedate = 22 January 2012 | accessdate =22 January 2012}}</ref> English was removed as an official language from the constitution approved by voters in the [[Malagasy constitutional referendum, 2010|November referendum 2010]].<ref name=4thRepublic/> The outcome of the referendum, and its consequences for official and national language policy, are not recognized by the political opposition or by the [[international community]], who cite lack of transparency and inclusiveness in the organization of the election by the [[High Transitional Authority]].<ref name="crisisgroup">{{cite web |url=http://www.crisisgroup.org/~/media/Files/africa/southern-africa/madagascar/166%20Madagascar%20a%20un%20tournant%20critique.ashx |archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/604mS5hLn |archivedate = 10 July 2011 |title=Madagascar: La Crise a un Tournant Critique? |accessdate=25 November 2010 |work=International Crisis Group }} {{fr}}</ref>

===Religion===
{{Main|Religion in Madagascar}}
[[File:Famadihana reburial razana ancestor Madagascar.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Famadihana]] reburial ceremony]]
Approximately half of the country's population practice traditional religion,<ref name=BGNote/> which tends to emphasize links between the living and the ''razana'' (ancestors). The [[Veneration of the dead|veneration of ancestors]] has led to the widespread tradition of tomb building, as well as the highlands practice of the ''[[famadihana]]'', whereby a deceased family member's remains may be exhumed to be periodically re-wrapped in fresh silk shrouds before being replaced in the tomb. The famadihana is an occasion to celebrate the beloved ancestor's memory, reunite with family and community, and enjoy a festive atmosphere.  Residents of surrounding villages are often invited to attend the party, where food and rum are typically served and a [[hiragasy]] troupe or other musical entertainment is commonly present.<ref name=famadihana>{{cite news | last = Bearak | first = Barry | title = Dead Join the Living in a Family Celebration | newspaper = New York Times |page = A7 | date = 5 September 2010 | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/06/world/africa/06madagascar.html|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/64fFKK5JL |archivedate = 13 January 2012 | accessdate =13 January 2012}}</ref> Consideration for ancestors is also demonstrated through adherence to ''fady'', taboos that are respected during and after the lifetime of the person who establishes them. It is widely believed that by showing respect for ancestors in these ways, they may intervene on behalf of the living. Conversely, misfortunes are often attributed to ancestors whose memory or wishes have been neglected. The sacrifice of zebu is a traditional method used to appease or honor the ancestors. In addition, the Malagasy traditionally believe in a creator god, called Zanahary or Andriamanitra.<ref name=Bradtbeliefs>Bradt (2011), pp.&nbsp;13<U+2013>20</ref>

Almost half the Malagasy are [[Christianity in Madagascar|Christian]], with practitioners of Protestantism slightly outnumbering adherents to [[Roman Catholicism in Madagascar|Roman Catholicism]].<ref name=BGNote/> In 1818 the [[London Missionary Society]] sent the first Christian missionaries to the island, where they built churches, translated the Bible into the Malagasy language and began to gain converts. Beginning in 1835 Queen [[Ranavalona I]] persecuted these converts as part of an attempt to halt European cultural and political influence on the island.  In 1869 a successor, Queen [[Ranavalona II]], converted the court to Christianity and encouraged Christian missionary activity, burning the ''[[sampy]]'' (royal idols) in a symbolic break with traditional beliefs.<ref>Ade Ajayi (1989), p. 437</ref>

Today, many Christians integrate their religious beliefs with traditional ones related to honoring the ancestors. For instance, they may bless their dead at church before proceeding with traditional burial rites or invite a [[minister (Christianity)|Christian minister]] to consecrate a ''famadihana'' reburial.<ref name=famadihana/> The Malagasy Council of Churches comprises the four oldest and most prominent Christian denominations (Roman Catholic, [[Church of Jesus Christ in Madagascar]], [[Malagasy Lutheran Church|Lutheran]], and [[Anglican]]) and has been an influential force in Malagasy politics.<ref name=USSD>{{cite web | last = Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor | title = International Religious Freedom Report: Madagascar | publisher = U.S. Department of State | year = 2006 | url = http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2006/71310.htm |archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/64rJD9LRN | archivedate = 22 January 2012 | accessdate =22 January 2012}}</ref>

[[Islam]] and [[Hinduism]] are also practiced on the island. Islam was first brought to the island in the Middle Ages by [[Arab people|Arab]] and [[Somali people|Somali]] [[Muslim]] traders, who established several Islamic schools along the eastern coast. While the use of Arabic script and loan words and the adoption of Islamic astrology would spread across the island, the Islamic religion failed to take hold in all but a handful of southeastern coastal communities. Today, [[Islam in Madagascar|Muslims]] constitute 7&nbsp;percent of the population of Madagascar and are largely concentrated in the northwestern provinces of [[Mahajanga]] and [[Antsiranana]]. Muslims are divided between those of Malagasy ethnicity, [[Demographics of India|Indians]], [[Demography of Pakistan|Pakistanis]] and [[Comoros|Comorians]]. More recently, Hinduism was introduced to Madagascar through [[Gujarati people|Gujarati]] people immigrating from the [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurashtra]] region of [[India]] in the late 19th century. Most Hindus in Madagascar speak [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] or [[Hindi]] at home.<ref name="id">{{cite web | title = Report of the High Level Committee on the Indian Diaspora | publisher = Ministry of External Affairs, India | year = 2004 | url = http://indiandiaspora.nic.in/diasporapdf/chapter8.pdf  | accessdate =22 January 2012 |archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/6AJxU0geu | archivedate = 31 August 2012}}</ref>

==Culture==
{{Main|Culture of Madagascar}}
Each of the many ethnic sub-groups in Madagascar adhere to their own set of beliefs, practices and ways of life that have historically contributed to their unique identities. However, there are a number of core cultural features that are common throughout the island, creating a strongly unified Malagasy cultural identity. In addition to a common language and shared traditional religious beliefs around a creator god and veneration of the ancestors, the traditional Malagasy worldview is shaped by values that emphasize ''fihavanana'' (solidarity), ''vintana'' (destiny), ''tody'' (karma), and ''[[Hasina (Madagascar)|hasina]]'', a sacred life force that traditional communities believe imbues and thereby legitimates authority figures within the community or family. Other cultural elements commonly found throughout the island include the practice of male circumcision; strong kinship ties; a widespread belief in the power of magic, diviners, astrology and witch doctors; and a traditional division of social classes into nobles, commoners, and slaves.<ref name="LOC" /><ref name=Bradtbeliefs/> Although social castes are no longer legally recognized, ancestral caste affiliation often continues to affect social status, economic opportunity and roles within the community.<ref>Middleton (1999), pp.&nbsp;259<U+2013>262, 272, 309</ref> Malagasy people traditionally consult ''Mpanandro'' ("Makers of the Days") to identify the most auspicious days for important events such as weddings or ''famadihana'', according to a traditional astrological system introduced by Arabs. Similarly, the nobles of many Malagasy communities in the pre-colonial period would commonly employ advisers known as the ''ombiasy'' (from ''olona-be-hasina'', "man of much virtue") of the southeastern [[Antemoro people|Antemoro]] ethnic group, who trace their ancestry back to early Arab settlers.<ref>Ames (2003), p. 101</ref>

The diverse origins of Malagasy culture are evident in its tangible expressions. The most emblematic instrument of Madagascar, the ''[[valiha]]'', is a [[bamboo]] tube [[zither]] carried to Madagascar by early settlers from [[South Kalimantan|southern Borneo]], and is very similar in form to those found in [[Music of Indonesia|Indonesia]] and the [[Music of the Philippines|Philippines]] today.<ref name="Blench, R. 1982 pp. 81-93">{{cite journal | last = Blench | first = Roger | title = Evidence for the Indonesian origins of certain elements of African culture | journal = African Music | volume = 6 | issue = 2 | pages = 81<U+2013>93 | year = 1982 | format=Subscription required | jstor = 30249759}}</ref> Traditional [[Architecture of Madagascar|houses in Madagascar]] are likewise similar to those of southern Borneo in terms of symbolism and construction, featuring a rectangular layout with a peaked roof and central support pillar.<ref>{{cite journal |last1 = Kus |first1 = Susan |last2 = Raharijaona |first2 = Victor | title = House to Palace, Village to State: Scaling up Architecture and Ideology |journal = American Anthropologist, New Series |issue = 102 |volume = 1 |pages = 98<U+2013>113 |year = 2000 |doi = 10.1525/aa.2000.102.1.98}}</ref> Reflecting a widespread veneration of the ancestors, tombs are culturally significant in many regions and tend to be built of more durable material, typically stone, and display more elaborate decoration than the houses of the living.<ref name="Acquier, Jean-Louis.">Acquier (1997), pp.&nbsp;143<U+2013>175</ref> The production and weaving of silk can be traced back to the island's earliest settlers, and Madagascar's national dress, the woven ''[[lamba (garment)|lamba]]'', has evolved into a varied and refined art.<ref>Kusimba, Odland & Bronson (2004), p. 12</ref> The Southeast Asian cultural influence is also evident in [[Malagasy cuisine]], in which rice is consumed at every meal, typically accompanied by one of a variety of flavorful vegetable or meat dishes.<ref>Bradt (2011), p. 312</ref> African influence is reflected in the sacred importance of zebu cattle and their embodiment of their owner's wealth, traditions originating on the African mainland. [[Cattle raiding|Cattle rustling]], originally a rite of passage for young men in the plains areas of Madagascar where the largest herds of cattle are kept, has become a dangerous and sometimes deadly criminal enterprise as herdsmen in the southwest attempt to defend their cattle with traditional spears against increasingly armed professional rustlers.<ref name=Camp93/>

===Arts===
[[File:Hira gasy dancer Madagascar.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Hiragasy]] dancer]]
A wide range of aural artistic traditions have developed in Madagascar. One of the island's foremost artistic traditions is its [[hainteny|oratory]], as expressed in the forms of ''hainteny'' (poetry), ''kabary'' (public discourse) and ''ohabolana'' (proverbs).<ref>Fox (1990), p. 39</ref><ref name="Madatana">{{cite web | last = Ravalitera | first = P | title = Origine Confuse des Vazimba du Betsiriry |work = Journal Express |publisher = Madatana.com | url=http://www.madatana.com/article-origine-confuse-des-vazimba-du-betsiriry.php |archiveurl =http://www.webcitation.org/604hJwBma |accessdate =11 November 2010 |archivedate = 10 July 2011}} {{fr}}</ref>  An epic poem exemplifying these traditions, the ''[[Ibonia]]'', has been handed down over the centuries in several different forms across the island, and offers insight into the diverse mythologies and beliefs of traditional Malagasy communities.<ref>{{cite web | title = Ibonia: the text in 17 sections |last = Unknown |publisher = University of Virginia | accessdate =15 November 2010 |url = http://xroads.virginia.edu/~Public/Ibonia/text.html |archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/604h5KUmV |archivedate = 10 July 2011}}</ref> This tradition was continued in the 20th century by such artists as [[Jean-Joseph Rabearivelo]], who is considered Africa's first modern poet,<ref>Rabearivelo (2007), p. x</ref> and [[Elie Rajaonarison]], an exemplar of the new wave of Malagasy poetry.<ref>Auzias & Labourdette (2007), p. 142</ref> Madagascar has also developed a rich [[Music of Madagascar|musical heritage]], embodied in dozens of regional musical genres such as the coastal ''[[salegy]]'' or highland ''[[hiragasy]]'' that enliven village gatherings, local dance floors and national airwaves.<ref name="Randrianary">Randrianary (2001), pp.&nbsp;109<U+2013>137</ref>

The plastic arts are also widespread throughout the island. In addition to the tradition of silk weaving and lamba production, the weaving of [[Raffia palm|raffia]] and other local plant materials has been used to create a wide array of practical items such as floor mats, baskets, purses and hats.<ref name=handicrafts/> Wood carving is a highly developed art form, with distinct regional styles evident in the decoration of balcony railings and other architectural elements. Sculptors create a variety of furniture and household goods, ''aloalo'' funerary posts, and wooden sculptures, many of which are produced for the tourist market.<ref name=Terrible>Heale & Abdul Latif (2008), pp.&nbsp;108<U+2013>111</ref> The decorative and functional woodworking traditions of the [[Zafimaniry]] people of the central highlands was inscribed on UNESCO's [[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists|list of Intangible Cultural Heritage]] in 2008.<ref>{{cite web | title = Woodcrafting Knowledge of the Zafimaniry |publisher = UNESCO | accessdate = 24 August 2012 |url = http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/en/RL/00080 |archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/6AA5SHVms |archivedate = 24 August 2012}}</ref>

Among the Antaimoro people, the production of paper embedded with flowers and other decorative natural materials is a long-established tradition that the community has begun to market to eco-tourists.<ref name=Terrible/> [[Embroidery]] and [[drawn thread work]] are done by hand to produce clothing, as well as tablecloths and other home textiles for sale in local crafts markets.<ref name=handicrafts/> A small but growing number of fine art galleries in Antananarivo, and several other urban areas, offer paintings by local artists, and annual art events, such as the Hosotra open-air exhibition in the capital, contribute to the continuing development of fine arts in Madagascar.<ref>{{cite news  | title = Des nouveaux talents mis en relief  | newspaper = L'Express de Madagascar | publisher = l'expressmada.com  | date = 7 August 2009  | url = http://www.lexpressmada.com/4376/hosotra-2009-madagascar/284-des-nouveaux-talents-mis-en-relief.html  | accessdate = 24 August 2012 |archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/6AACBykvX| archivedate = 24 August 2012}} {{fr}}</ref>

===Sport and recreation===
A number of traditional pastimes have emerged in Madagascar. ''[[Moraingy]]'', a type of hand-to-hand combat, is a popular spectator sport in coastal regions. It is traditionally practiced by men, but women have recently begun to participate.<ref>Ratsimbazafy (2010), pp.&nbsp;14<U+2013>18</ref> The wrestling of zebu cattle (''tolon-omby'') is also practiced in many regions.<ref name=lambatradition>Kusimba, Odland & Bronson (2004), p. 87</ref> In addition to sports, a wide variety of games are played. Among the most emblematic is ''[[fanorona]]'', a board game widespread throughout the Highland regions. According to folk legend, the succession of King [[Andrianjaka]] after his father [[Ralambo]] was partially due to the obsession that Andrianjaka's older brother may have had with playing ''fanorona'' to the detriment of his other responsibilities.<ref name="iarivo">{{cite web |last=City of Antananarivo |title=Antananarivo: Histoire de la commune |url=http://www.iarivo-town.mg/histoire.php |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5wZeOMH4e |accessdate=2 August 2010 |archivedate=17 February 2011}} {{fr}}</ref>

Western recreational activities were introduced to Madagascar over the past two centuries.
[[Rugby union in Madagascar|Rugby]] is considered the national sport of Madagascar.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.irb.com/newsmedia/regional/newsid=53025.html |accessdate=24 July 2012 |title=Madagascar take Sevens honours |date = 23 August 2007 | publisher = International Rugby Board |archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/6AGpxxkZd |archivedate = 29 August 2012}}</ref> [[Football in Madagascar|Football]] is also popular. Madagascar has produced a world champion in [[p<U+00E9>tanque]], a French game similar to [[lawn bowling]], which is widely played in urban areas and throughout the Highlands.<ref>{{cite web | last = Vegar | first = Ness | title = Madagascar won the World Championship | publisher = petanque.org | date = 4 October 1999 | url = http://www.petanque.org/news/admin/61.shtml | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/64g5qw5nC | archivedate = 14 January 2011 | accessdate =14 January 2011}}</ref> School athletics programs typically include soccer, track and field, judo, boxing, women's basketball and women's tennis. Madagascar sent its first competitors to the Olympic Games in 1964 and has also competed in the African Games.<ref name=EBLand/> [[Scouting]] is represented in Madagascar by its [[Firaisan'ny Skotisma eto Madagasikara|own local federation]] of three scouting clubs. Membership in 2011 was estimated at 14,905.<ref name="Census_2010">{{cite web |title=Triennal review: Census as at 1 December 2010|url=http://scout.org/en/content/download/22261/199900/file/Census.pdf |publisher=World Organization of the Scout Movement |accessdate=13 January 2011 |date = 1 December 2010 |archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/6AJxh3uLm | archivedate = 31 August 2012}}</ref>
