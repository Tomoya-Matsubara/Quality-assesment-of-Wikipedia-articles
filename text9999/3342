'''Joseph "Josip" Schlessinger''' (born March 26, 1945 in [[Topusko]], [[Croatia]]) is an [[Croatian]]-[[Israel]]i-[[United States|American]] [[biochemist]] and biophysician, born in Croatia, then in the liberated territory of [[Yugoslavia]]. Chair of the [[Pharmacology]] Department at [[Yale University]] School of Medicine in [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]], [[Connecticut]].  His area of research is signaling through [[tyrosine]] [[phosphorylation]], which is important in many areas of cellular regulation, especially growth control and [[cancer]].  Schlessinger is best known for his studies that have led to an understanding of the mechanism of transmembrane signaling  by receptor [[tyrosine kinase]]s and how the resulting signals are transmitted within the cell to control cell growth and differentiation.

==Early life==
Schlessinger was born in the village Topusko, Croatia, to a [[Jew]]ish parents. His father Imre was from [[Slatina]] and was married prior to a marriage with a Schlessinger mother. He had a wife and child who were taken to [[Auschwitz]]. His mother Rivka was from [[Bugojno]] and was also married before marriage with a Schlessinger father. Schlessinger mother first marriage family was killed by [[Usta<U+0161>e|Ustashe]]. Imre and Rivka Schlessinger met in the [[labor camp]] in 1943 on the island [[Rab]]. There they joined a group composed of Jews, and fled to join the [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisans]]. Schlessinger was born on March 26, 1945 among the partisans in Topusko, under war fighting. His mother wrapped him in the silk of a [[British Army|British military]] parachute. Schlessinger parents named him Josip, after his late grandfather. After [[World War II]] Schlessinger family moved to [[Osijek]]. There, in 1947, Schlessinger younger brother Darko David was born. However, after horrors of the Second World War Schlessinger family did not find peace in Osijek because Imre Schlessinger, who has not harbored sympathy for communism, once joked at the expense of [[Josip Broz Tito]] and was sentenced to several months in jail.<ref name=jl>{{cite news|url=http://www.jutarnji.hr/joseph-schlessinger--borio-sam-se-za-izrael--izumio-sutent--sad-mogu-natrag-u-svoju-hrvatsku/309456/|title=Joseph Schlessinger: Borio sam se za Izrael, izumio Sutent.

==Publications and research==
According to [[PubMed]], Schlessinger has authored over 450 scientific original and review articles in the areas of pharmacology, molecular biology, biochemistry, and structural biology, mostly on [[tyrosine kinase]] signaling. Tyrosine kinase signaling plays a critical role in the control of many cellular processes including [[cell growth|cell proliferation]], [[differentiation (cellular)|differentiation]], [[metabolism]], as well as cell survival and [[cell migration|migration]].<ref name="Schlessinger Lab: Biography"/>  Tyrosine kinases play a particularly important role in cancer, and several agents that block their activity are now used as anti-cancer drugs, such as [[Imatinib]] or [[Gleevec]]. Among his contributions are the findings that cell surface receptors with tyrosine kinase activity signal across membrane by forming dimers when they bind to their growth factor activators. He discovered this in studies of the [[epidermal growth factor receptor]] (EGFR). He was also instrumental in understanding how the [[SH2 domain]] controls tyrosine kinase signaling by binding to phosphorylated tyrosines in activated receptors. One of the seminal findings in this work was his laboratory's cloning of [[Grb2]] and other [[Adaptor proteins|Adaptor protein]]s. Another is the lab's cloning of [[FRS2]], which is critical for signaling by the [[Fibroblast growth factor receptor]]. In 2001, he was ranked by the ISI as one of the world's top 30 most cited scientists (across all fields) in the 1990s.<ref>[http://www.in-cites.com/scientists/dr-joseph-schlessinger.html ISI InCites Interview]</ref> His papers have been cited a total of 76,699 times.<ref>[http://isihighlycited.com/ ISI Highly Cited Scientists Database]</ref> A September 2003 article in the UK newspaper ''[[The Guardian]]'' listed him as number 14 in the "Giants of Science."<ref>[http://education.guardian.co.uk/higher/sciences/story/0,,1048716,00.html Guardian article, The Giants of Science]</ref>

==Personal life==
Schlessinger served his compulsory military service with the [[Golani]] [[infantry]] brigade and was commissioned an officer. As part of his reserve duty he participated in the [[Six-Day War]] and the [[Yom Kippur War]]. 

He is married to Irit Lax, an associate professor in the Pharmacology Department at Yale. She was previously an assistant professor in the Pharmacology Department at NYU Medical Center. The focus of her research is on the [[fibroblast growth factor]] (FGF) receptor. Lax has been working together with Joseph Schlessinger since she was a graduate student in [[Israel]] in the early 1980s. They  each have two children from a previous marriage.<ref name="The long war"/> 

Schlessinger considers himself [[atheist]]. In a 2009 interview with a Croatian daily newspaper ''[[Jutarnji list]]'', he said, "Basically I am atheist. I grew up Jewish and I truly belong to the Jewish culture, but I'm not a follower of any world religion. Religion does not interest me at all."<ref name=jl/>

In 2006, a [[sexual harassment]] lawsuit was initiated against [[Yale University]] by Schlessinger's former secretary, Mary Beth Garceau.  Garceau alleged numerous episodes of harassment by Joseph Schlessinger during her employment at Yale<ref>[http://www.wcbs880.com/pages/137885.php?contentType=4&contentId=251395 Yale Professor Faces Sexual Harassment Suit WCBS 880 New York]</ref><ref>[http://www.hartford.edu/daily/media.asp?id=2267 University of Hartford Media Watch] Nov.27-Dec.4, 2006</ref><ref>[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-29227184_ITM Yale ex-secretary sues for sex harassment From publication: "Women in Higher Education"] Jan.1, 2007</ref><ref>[http://chronicle.com/news/article/1350/alleged-harassment-by-renowned-researcher-prompts-suit-against-yale Harassment by Renowned Researcher Prompts Suit Against Yale, ''Chronicle of Higher Education''] Dec.2, 2006</ref> and claimed that [[Yale University]] failed to act upon her frequent complaints, thus causing Garceau to resign. The case was settled out of court in mid-2007 and the terms of the settlement were not publicly disclosed.<ref>[http://www.yalealumnimagazine.com/issues/2007_07/l_v.html Another Lawsuit Against the University... ''Yale Alumni Magazine''], July 2007.</ref>

==SUGEN==
In 1991, Schlessinger co-founded (with Axel Ullrich and Steven Evans-Freke) the biotechnology company SUGEN to develop ATP-like molecules that would compete with ATP for binding to the catalytic site of receptor tyrosine kinases in cancer treatment. SUGEN later became part of [[Pfizer]].<ref>[[Pfizer#SUGEN|SUGEN section in Pfizer Wikipedia article]]</ref> One of the pipeline products (SU11248) was ultimately developed by Pfizer as Sutent ([[Sunitinib]]),<ref>[http://www.sutent.com/ Sutent website]</ref> approved by the FDA for treating gastrointestinal stromal tumors and renal cell carcinoma.<ref>[http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/2006/ucm108583.htm FDA news announcement on Sutent]</ref>

==Plexxikon==
Following his involvement in SUGEN, Schlessinger co-founded [[Plexxikon]] with [[Sung-Hou Kim]] ([[University of California, Berkeley]]).  Plexxikon, founded in 2001, uses a pioneering structural biology-based platform for  drug discovery.<ref>[http://www.plexxikon.com/ Plexxikon web site]</ref>
