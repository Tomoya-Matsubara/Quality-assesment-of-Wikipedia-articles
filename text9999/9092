'''''Adrenalize''''' is the fifth [[album]] by [[Britain|British]] [[hard rock]] band [[Def Leppard]], released in 1992. The album was the first by the band following the [[1991]] death of guitarist [[Steve Clark]]. It was produced by [[Mike Shipley]] and [[Def Leppard]], with [[Robert John "Mutt" Lange]] as executive producer.<br>

==Album History==

At the end of the ''[[Hysteria]]'' world tour in [[October]] [[1988]], Def Leppard vowed to the press that their next album would not take another four years to be released, and quickly reconvened weeks later to start work. However, [[Steve Clark]]'s alcoholism demons were taking a turn for the worse. Whereas touring had kept him sober onstage, offstage his condition was beginning to affect his work in the studio. In addition, [[Mutt Lange]] was unavailable to return as producer as he was working with Canadian rocker [[Bryan Adams]] on his [[Waking up the Neighbours]] album.

The band chose to produce the album themselves. Steve's problems did not help to advance progress and in fact, was starting to set them back. In late [[1989]], Clark would be found unconscious in a gutter in [[Minnesota]], MN. He was immediately sent to rehab, and band members (along with Lange) would start attending confrontational therapy to attempt to shame him into defeating his addictions. In a desperate move to help their friend, guitar tech Malvin Mortimer would be assigned to keep a 24 hour watch on Clark.

None of this would prove to be fruitful, and in [[August]] [[1990]] the band granted Clark a six-month leave of absence. While it was hoped that this break would free him of any stresses, the band seemed resigned to the fact that they could no longer do anything for Clark.

Sure enough, on [[January 8]], [[1991]], [[Steve Clark]] was found dead in his [[London]] home by his girlfriend Janie Dean. The coroner's report revealed that Clark had mixed [[alcohol]] with [[painkillers]] [[and anti-depressants]] that led to compression of the [[brain stem]]. 

After a short period of uncertainty about the band's future, the remaining members decided to resume work on the album. Former Lange engineer [[Mike Shipley]] was hired as co-producer, while Lange maintained a minor role via phone calls and demos sent to him. 

A search for Clark's replacement was held off until after the completion of the album, and recording sessions progressed quickly in the year that followed. On [[March 31]], [[1992]], ''Adrenalize'' was released worldwide. While some reviews were favorable ([[Rolling Stone]] magazine awarded &nbsp; it 4 out of 5 stars), many critics attacked the album for being [[formulaic]] and too similar to ''[[Hysteria (album)|Hysteria]]''.

Further complicating matters, ''Adrenalize'' came out right at the time when [[grunge]] and [[alternative rock]] bands were breaking into the mainstream at the expense of "[[pop metal]]" bands. Nonetheless, ''Adrenalize'' debuted at Number One in both the UK and the US (quickly going triple platinum there). The album was dedicated to the memory of [[Steve Clark]].

Former [[Dio]] and [[Whitesnake]] guitarist [[Vivian Campbell]], a longtime friend of the band's, was brought in as the newest member in [[April]] [[1992]].
