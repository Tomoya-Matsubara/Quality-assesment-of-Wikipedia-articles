{{creationism2}}

'''Neo-creationism''' is a movement whose goal is to restate [[creationism]] in terms more likely to be well received by the public, policy makers, educators and the [[scientific community]]. It aims to [[Framing (social sciences)|re-frame]] the debate over the [[Creation myth|origins of life]] in non-religious terms and without appeals to scripture. This comes in response to the 1987 ruling by the [[United States Supreme Court]] in [[Edwards v. Aguillard]] that creationism is an inherently religious concept and that advocating it as correct or accurate in public school curricula violates the [[Establishment Clause of the First Amendment]].<ref name=morris_neo>[http://www.icr.org/index.php?module=articles&action=view&ID=425 Neocreationism] [[Henry M. Morris]], [[Institute for Creation Research]]</ref><ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/21/magazine/21ONLANGUAGE.html?ref=onlanguage  On Language: Neo-Creo] William Safire. The New York Times. August 21, 2005.</ref><ref name=Scott1996/>

One of its principal claims is that ostensibly [[Objectivity (science)|objective]] orthodox science, with a foundation in [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]], is actually a dogmatically [[atheism|atheistic]] [[religion]].<ref>[http://www.darwinreconsidered.org/media/MaterialistMythology.pdf Darwinism is Materialist Mythology, Not Science] Phillip E. Johnson. DarwinReconsidered.org.</ref> Its proponents argue that the [[scientific method]] excludes certain explanations of phenomena, particularly where they point towards supernatural elements, thus effectively excluding religious insight from contributing to understanding the [[universe]]. This leads to an open and often hostile opposition to what they term "[[Darwinism]]", which generally is meant to refer to [[evolution]], but may be extended to include such concepts as [[abiogenesis]], [[stellar evolution]] and the [[Big Bang]] theory.

Notable neo-creationist organizations are the [[Discovery Institute]] and its [[Center for Science and Culture]]. Neo-creationists have yet to establish a recognized line of legitimate scientific research and thus far lack scientific and academic legitimacy, even among many academics of evangelical Christian colleges.<ref>Goodstein, Laurie, [http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/04/weekinreview/04good.html "IDEAS & TRENDS; Intelligent Design Might Be Meeting Its Maker"] (Subscription required), ''[[NY Times]]'', December 4, 2005, Section 4, Page 1, Column 1.</ref> Neo-creationism is considered by [[Eugenie C.

==Motivations==
The neo-creationist movement is motivated by the fear that religion is under attack by the study of evolution.<ref>[[Charles W. Colson]], [[Nancy Pearcey]], Harold Fickett. 1999 ''How Now Shall We Live?''</ref><ref>"Both Defendants and many of the leading proponents of ID make a bedrock assumption which is utterly false. Their presupposition is that evolutionary theory is antithetical to a belief in the existence of a supreme being and to religion in general. Repeatedly in this trial, Plaintiffs<U+2019> scientific experts testified that the theory of evolution represents good science, is overwhelmingly accepted by the scientific community, and that it in no way conflicts with, nor does it deny, the existence of a divine creator." [[wikisource:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District/6:Curriculum, Conclusion#H. Conclusion Ruling, pg. 136]] [[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]].</ref><ref>"Johnson has concluded that science must be redefined to include the supernatural if religious challenges to evolution are to get a hearing. (11:8<U+2013>15 (Forrest); P-429). Additionally, Dembski agrees that science is ruled by methodological naturalism and argues that this rule must be overturned if ID is to prosper. (Trial Tr. vol. 5, Pennock Test., 32<U+2013>34, Sept. 28, 2005)." [[wikisource:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District/2:Context#Page 30 of 139 Ruling - Context, pg. 30]] [[Kitzmiller v.

== Tactics ==
Much of the effort of neo-creationists in response to science consists of [[polemics]] highlighting gaps in understanding or minor inconsistencies in the literature of [[biology]], then making statements about what can and cannot happen in biological systems.<ref>[http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/articles/050530fa_fact Devolution&mdash;Why intelligent design isn't] H. Allen Orr. Annals of Science.

The Panda's Thumb, May 4, 2005.</ref> Critics of neo-creationism suggest that neo-creationist science consists of [[Quote mining|quote-mining]] the biological literature (including outdated literature) for minor slips, inconsistencies or polemically promising examples of internal arguments.  These internal disagreements, fundamental to the working of all natural science, are then presented dramatically to lay audiences as evidence of the fraudulence and impending collapse of "[[Darwinism]]".<ref name="trojan">{{cite book |title=[[Creationism's Trojan Horse]]

}}</ref> Critics suggest that Neo-creationists routinely employ this method to exploit the technical issues within biology and evolutionary theory to their advantage, relying on a public that is not sufficiently scientifically literate to follow the complex and sometimes difficult details. [[Robert T. Pennock]] argues that intelligent design proponents are "manufacturing dissent" in order to explain the absence of scientific debate of their claims: "The 'scientific' claims of such neo-creationists as Johnson, Denton, and Behe rely, in part, on the notion that these issues [surrounding evolution] are the subject of suppressed debate among biologists....  According to neo-creationists, the apparent absence of this discussion and the nearly universal rejection of neo-creationist claims must be due to the conspiracy among professional biologists instead of a lack of scientific merit."<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=CIFM67GkCyMC ''Intelligent Design Creationism and Its Critics: Philosophical, Theological, and Scientific Perspectives''] [[Robert T. Pennock]]. MIT Press, 2001. Page 322.</ref>

[[Eugenie Scott]] describes neo-creationism as "a mixed bag of antievolution strategies brought about by legal decisions against equal time laws".<ref>[http://ncse.com/creationism/general/antievolutionism-creationism-united-states Antievolutionism and Creationism in the United States] Eugenie C. Scott. [[National Center for Science Education]].</ref> Those legal decisions, [[McLean v. Arkansas]] and [[Edwards v. Aguillard]], doomed the teaching of [[creation science]] as an alternative to evolution in public school science classes. Scott considers intelligent design, and the various strategies of design proponents like [[Teach the Controversy]] and [[Critical Analysis of Evolution]], as leading examples of neo-creationism.

Neo-creationists generally reject the term "neo-creation", alleging it is a pejorative term.<ref>[http://www.utdallas.edu/orgs/idea/faqs.htm FAQs]  IDEA Club, University of Texas, Dallas.</ref>{{verify credibility|date=November 2010}} Any linkage of their views to creationism would undermine their goal of being viewed as advocating a new form of science. Instead, they identify themselves to their non-scientific audience as conducting valid science.{{Or|date=November 2010}} This is rejected by the vast majority of actual science practitioners.<ref>[[List of scientific societies rejecting intelligent design]]</ref><ref>[[Wikisource:Kitzmiller v.

Much of that published work is [[polemics|polemical]] in nature, disputing and controverting what they see as a "scientific orthodoxy" which shields and protects "Darwinism" while attacking and ridiculing alleged alternatives like intelligent design.<ref name="richards"/><ref>[http://www.agiweb.org/geotimes/july00/scene.html Creationists Open a New Front] David Applegate.

==Criticism==
All of the following names make explicit the connections between traditional creationism, neo-creationism and [[intelligent design]]. Not all critics of neo-creationism are on the evolution side of the debate. [[Henry M. Morris]], a notable [[Young Earth Creationism|young earth creationist]], accepted the term<ref name=morris_neo/> but opposed the logic of neo-creationism for the very reason that it does not embrace the Bible.<ref>[http://www.icr.org/index.php?module=articles&action=view&ID=859 Design Is Not Enough!] [[Henry M. Morris]], [[Institute for Creation Research]]</ref> The Baptist Center for Ethics calls for "Baptists to recommit themselves to the separation of church and state, which will keep public schools free from coercive pressure to promote sectarian faith, such as state-written school prayers and the teaching of neo-creationism..."<ref>[http://www.nheri.org/content/view/195/71/ Some Baptists Supporting Government-Run Schools] Brian D.
