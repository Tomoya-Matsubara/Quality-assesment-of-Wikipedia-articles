[[PlayStation 3]] owners can purchase a wealth of accessories that are designed for or are compatible with the Playstation 3 system.
These accessories include game controllers, audio and video input devices like microphones and video cameras, and cables for improved sound and picture quality.

== Sixaxis ==<!--This section is linked from redirects [[Sixaxis]] and [[SIXAXIS]]-->
[[Image:Sixaxis ps3 controller.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Playstation 3's Sixaxis wireless controller]]
The '''Sixaxis Wireless Controller''' (trademarked "SIXAXIS") was the official wireless [[video game controller|controller]] for the [[Sony]] [[PlayStation 3]], later to be succeeded by the [[Dualshock#DualShock 3|DualShock 3]].
In [[Japan]], individual Sixaxis controllers were available for purchase simultaneously with the console's launch, without a USB to USB mini cable.
The word "Sixaxis" (contraction of "six axis" for the directional movements) is a [[palindrome]].
 
=== History ===
At [[E3]] [[2005]], [[Sony]] showcased their "boomerang" design for the [[PlayStation 3]]'s controller.  Accompanied by much criticism, most of which were for its looks, this design was later abandoned. Sony later stated that the original controller "was very clearly designed as a design concept, and was never intended to be the final controller, despite what everybody said about it."<ref name="Phil Harrison Interview interview">{{cite web|last=Fahey|first=Rob|date=[[2006-05-12]]|url=http://www.gamesindustry.net/content_page.php?aid=16969|title= E<U+00B3>: Sony's Phil Harrison|work=GamesIndustry.biz|accessdate=2006-08-30}}</ref>
<!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:Playstation 3 Controlller.jpg|thumb|The final design, currently used]] -->

The boomerang design was replaced by an altered, wireless version of the [[Dualshock#DualShock 2|DualShock 2]] controller at [[E3]] [[2006]]

The Sixaxis controller is currently being phased out, and the [[DualShock 3]] is the new official controller, which in addition to a vibration feature will still include Sixaxis functionality. However Europe will still have the Sixaxis controller during summer as the European ''Metal Gear Solid 4'' PlayStation 3 bundle includes a Sixaxis. <ref>[http://multiplayerblog.mtv.com/2008/04/02/sony-non-shocker-sixaxis-discontinued/ MTV Multiplayer <U+00BB> Sony Non-Shocker: Sixaxis Discontinued<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  The Sixaxis is no longer being produced.

==== Feature and design changes ====

The Sixaxis can operate for up to 30 hours on a full charge. The battery was originally not thought to be replaceable when a Sony spokesperson stated that the Sixaxis should operate for "many years before there's any degradation in terms of battery performance. When and if this happens, then of course [[Sony]] will be providing a service to exchange these items".<ref name="battery life and replacement">[http://www.gamesindustry.biz/content_page.php?aid=20528 Sony to replace PS3 controllers // GamesIndustry.biz<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Later, it was revealed that the Sixaxis came with instructions on how to remove the battery and that the battery was fully removable.<ref>[http://gizmodo.com/gadgets/home-entertainment/ps3-sixaxis-controllers-battery-is-kinda-replaceable-214144.php gizmodo.com]</ref>

A major feature of the controller is the ability to sense both [[rotation]]al orientation and [[Translation (geometry)|translational]] [[acceleration]] along all three dimensional axes, providing [[six degrees of freedom]].<ref name="pr_control">{{cite press release|publisher=Sony Computer Entertainment Inc.|date=[[2006-05-09]]|title=SCE ANNOUNCES NEW CONTROLLER FOR PLAYSTATION3||format=PDF|url=http://www.scei.co.jp/corporate/release/pdf/060509be.pdf|accessdate=2006-05-24}}</ref> This became a matter of controversy, as the circumstances of the announcement, made less than eight months after [[Nintendo]] revealed motion-sensing capabilities in its new game console controller (see [[Wii Remote]]), led to speculation that the addition of motion-sensing was a late-stage decision by [[Sony]] to follow Nintendo's move. Further fueling the speculation was the fact that only one game shown at [[E3]] that year demonstrated the motion-sensing feature. {{Fact|date=March 2007}}  Also, some comments from [[Incognito Entertainment]], the developer behind the motion-sensing [[PlayStation 3]] game, [[Warhawk (PlayStation 3)|Warhawk]], said that it received development controllers with the motion-sensing feature only 10 days or so before E3.<ref name="ten_days">{{cite web|publisher=Kotaku|date=[[2006-05-12]]|title=Incognito Had 10 Days To Design Warhammer's Tilt-Sensitive Controls|url=http://www.kotaku.com/gaming/incognito/incognito-had-10-days-to-design-warhammers-tiltsensitive-controls-173405.php|accessdate=2007-01-01}}</ref> Developer Brian Upton from [[SCE Studios Santa Monica]] later clarified that the Incognito had been secretly working on the motion-sensing technology "for a while", but did not receive a working controller until "the last few weeks before E3".<ref name="eurogamer">{{cite web|publisher=Eurogamer|date=N/A|title=WarHawk dev knew about tilt|url=
http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=65844|accessdate=2007-01-01}}</ref>

The Sixaxis features finer analog sensitivity than the [[DualShock 2]], increased to 10-bit precision from the 8-bit precision of the DualShock 2.<ref>[http://www.us.playstation.com/PS3/Accessories/SCPH-98040 PlayStation.com - PLAYSTATION<U+00AE>3 - Accessories - SIXAXIS<U+2122> Wireless Controller<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The frame around the L2 and R2 buttons has been omitted, resulting in more trigger-like buttons, with an increased range of depression. In the place of the "Analog" mode button switch of previous dual analog models is a jewel-like "PS button" with the PlayStation logo, which can be used to access the home menu, switch controller inputs and turn the console or the controller on or off.

Some Sixaxis are made from translucent plastic, which, when held against light, reveals the inner components of the controller.

====LED lights====
[[Image:ps3 Led Lights.JPG|thumb|right|The top of a SIXAXIS controller, LED lights on the right.]]
A row of four numbered [[light-emitting diode|LED]] port indicators are on the top of the controller, to identify and distinguish multiple wireless controllers. Due to there being only four player LEDs on the controller itself, multiple indicators light up for players 5, 6 and 7 (for example, if the '4' and '1' indicators are illuminated at the same time, the controller is assigned to Player 5). While the PS3 is turned on, pressing the PS button will bring up a menu displaying the battery charge of all synced controllers among other options.

=== Partial list of games that support 5-7 players offline ===

The following games support 7 players offline on a single screen unless otherwise noted. In addition to Sony-made controllers, most any USB controller will work due to the PS3's plug-and-play capabilities.{{fact|date=November 2008}} Due to the Xbox 360 controller requiring driver support, it will not function, but most PC controllers will, in addition to PS2 controllers connected via a PS2-to-USB adapter.

====Removal of vibration capability====
Sony announced that because of the included motion sensors, the vibration feature of previous PlayStation controllers was removed, stating that the vibration would interfere with motion-sensing.<ref name="pr_control" /> This therefore made the PS3 wireless controller incredibly light, which felt strange to players accustomed to heavier controllers such as the [[DualShock]]. [[Haptic]]s developer [[Immersion Corporation]], which had successfully sued Sony for patent infringement,<ref name="Immersion suit">{{cite press release|publisher=Immersion Corporation|date=[[2005-03-08]]|title=Immersion Obtains $90.7 Million Judgment in Patent Infringement Case Against Sony|url=http://immr.client.shareholder.com/ReleaseDetail.cfm?ReleaseID=158652|accessdate=2006-07-01}}</ref> expressed skepticism of Sony's rationale, with company president Victor Viegas stating in an interview, "I don<U+2019>t believe it<U+2019>s a very difficult problem to solve, and Immersion has experts that would be happy to solve that problem for them," under the condition that Sony withdraw its appeal of the patent infringement ruling.<ref name="Viegas interview">{{cite web|last=Murdey|first=Chase|date=[[2006-05-17]]|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/features/20060517/murdey_01.shtml|title= Ready to Rumble? Immersion's Victor Viegas on PlayStation 3's Lack of Vibration|work=Gamasutra|publisher=CMP Media LLC|accessdate=2006-07-01}}</ref> Immersion later emphasized compatibility with motion-sensing when introducing its next-generation vibration feedback technology, TouchSense.<ref name="TouchSense announcement">{{cite press release|publisher=Immersion Corporation|date=[[2006-06-19]]|title=Immersion Corporation Introduces Next-Generation Vibration Technology for Video Console Gaming Systems|url=http://immr.client.shareholder.com/ReleaseDetail.cfm?ReleaseID=201102|accessdate=2006-07-01}}</ref>  Subsequent statements from Sony were dismissive of the arguments from Immersion, with [[Sony Computer Entertainment America]] (SCEA) Senior VP of Marketing Peter Dille stating, "It seems like the folks at Immersion are looking to sort of negotiate through the press and try to make their case to us&nbsp;<U+2026> we've talked about how there's a potential for that rumble to interfere with the Sixaxis controller."<ref name="Peter_Dille>[http://www.engadget.com/2006/11/06/the-engadget-interview-peter-dille-sony-computer-entertainment/  Engadget.com]</ref>

However, in a press release made some eight months later, [[Phil Harrison]], Sony's president of worldwide studios, said: "Now, rumble I think was the last generation feature; it's not the next-generation feature. I think motion sensitivity is." He added that rumbling would, in the future, only come from third-party controllers. <ref name="Phil Harrison quote about rumble being 'last gen'">{{cite press release|publisher=GameDaily BIZ|date=[[2007-02-26]]|title=Sony: Rumble is a 'Last Generation Feature'|url=http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3157501}}</ref>.  That statement was proven false less than a year later, with the announcement of the ''[[DualShock 3]]''.

=== Partial list of games using Sixaxis motion sensor ===
It should be noted that some of the demo versions of these games do not allow use of the motion sensor.

[[Image:Dualshock 3 Ceramic White.JPG|thumb|180px|right|Ceramic White]]


{{main|DualShock#DualShock 3|l1=DualShock - DualShock 3}}

The DualShock 3 will be the official PlayStation 3 controller, replacing the SIXAXIS completely (while keeping the functionality of SIXAXIS). At its press conference at the 2007 [[Tokyo Game Show]], Sony announced the [[DualShock|DualShock 3]] (trademarked "DUALSHOCK 3"), a PlayStation 3 controller with the same function and design as the Sixaxis, but with vibration capability.<ref name="DualShock 3 PR">{{cite web |url=http://www.scei.co.jp/corporate/release/070920be.html |title=DualShock 3 Wireless Controller With Rumble Feature To Be Introduced FOR PLAYSTATION3 |accessdate=2007-09-20 |date=2007-09-20 |work= |publisher=Sony Computer Entertainment}}</ref>.

On [[November 11]] [[2007]], the official DualShock 3 controller was released in Japan, in Piano Black and Ceramic White, as well as Satin Silver (to match the Japanese color variations of the 40GB PS3 model). Software patches to provide a vibration function in previously-released PS3 software were made available.

== PlayStation Eye ==
{{main|PlayStation Eye}}
The '''PlayStation Eye''' is an updated version of the EyeToy [[USB]] [[webcam]] designed for the PlayStation 3. It will not work with PS2 EyeToy games, but the PS3 does support the [[PlayStation 2]] [[EyeToy]], using its camera and microphone functionalities.  A firmware update enabled the PlayStation 3 to support all USB webcams which used the [[USB video device class|USB Video Class]]
{{-}}

==PlayTV==
{{mainarticle|PlayTV}}
Officially announced [[August 22]], [[2007]]; '''PlayTV''' is a twin-channel [[DVB-T]] tuner peripheral with [[digital video recorder]] (DVR) software which allows users to record television programs to the PlayStation 3 hard drive for later viewing. Programs can be recorded while playing a game. The device was launched in the UK on the 19 September 2008 with other regions in Europe to follow. [5]

It has been reported that Australia will receive the Play TV accessory only 2 months after Europe. Currently earmarked for Q4 2008 [6]

Because North American markets, including the United States, Canada, and Mexico will be using the ATSC digital standard (and the latter two are currently early in their digital transition), it is unlikely they will see the PlayTV device because of compatibility issues.

== Headsets ==
[[Image:Official_PS3_Wireless_Bluetooth_Headset.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Official PS3 Wireless Bluetooth Headset]]
{{further|[[List of Bluetooth headsets compatible with PlayStation 3]]}}
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Warhawkheadset.jpg|thumb|A Bluetooth [[Headphones|headset]]]] -->
Most commercial [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] headsets are compatible with the [[PlayStation 3]]. In addition, the PlayStation 3 supports some [[PlayStation 2]] USB accessories, including the  USB ''[[SOCOM: U.S. Navy SEALs]]'' headset by [[Logitech]], the ''[[SingStar]]'' microphones and the built-in microphone on the Eyetoy for video and voice chat (although the EyeToy Play game associated with the EyeToy is not available for use on European PlayStation 3s ).  Since the PlayStation 3 supports Bluetooth technology, any type of wireless headset is compatible with the system<ref name="pr_specs">{{cite press release|title=Any Bluetooth headset compatible with PS3|url=http://www.playstatic.com/news/180|accessdate=2006-11-11}}</ref>; however, Bluetooth wireless headsets are not compatible with PlayStation 2 games which use the USB headsets (due to being programmed for them only) and therefore the USB headsets must still be used (though this could potentially be solved with future firmware updates). On Sept. 12, 2007, Logitech announced<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.logitech.com/index.cfm/172/3790&cl=us,en |title=Logitech Unveils Bluetooth-Enabled Headset and Keyboard Designed for PLAYSTATION 3 |publisher=Logitech |date=[[2007-09-12]]}}</ref> new, Cordless Vantage Headset for Playstation 3. The Blu-ray Disc retail version of ''[[Warhawk (PlayStation 3 game)|Warhawk]]'' comes bundled with a [[Jabra]] BT125 Bluetooth headset in North America and the [[Jabra]] BT135 in Europe.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://games.ign.com/articles/817/817415p1.html |title=Warhawk Released |accessdate= |last=Dunham |first=Alexis |date=[[2007-08-28]] |publisher=IGN}}</ref>

On June 27, 2008, it was announced that the headset that will be paired with the Blu-ray Disc version of ''[[SOCOM: U.S. Navy SEALs Confrontation]]'' will be the official Bluetooth headset for the PlayStation 3 <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.play.com/Games/PlayStation3/4-/6704615/Official-PS3-Wireless-Bluetooth-Headset/Product.html |title=Official PS3 Wireless Bluetooth Headset |publisher=Play.com}}</ref> (see image).
It will boast exclusive features such as a mute button, and will come with a charging cradle so that it may charge while connected to one of the system's [[USB 2.0|USB]] ports <ref>{{cite web|url=http://socom.us.playstation.com/post/2008/06/Media-Day-03-Bluetooth%c2%ae.aspx |title=Media Day 03: Bluetooth<U+00AE>!? |accessdate= |last=Brothers |first=David |date=[[2008-06-27]] |publisher=SOCOM.com}}</ref>, which is being marketed as being useful for storing when not in use.

The official headset allows for high quality voice-chat, and provides volume level, battery level, charging status and connection status indicators on the PS3's on-screen display. The headset can be used as a microphone when docked in the charging cradle - voice output from PS3 is automatically transferred to the TV in this case.

== BD Remote == 

The PlayStation 3 '''BD Remote''' (CECHZR1) allows users to control videos and music on [[Blu-ray Disc]] and [[DVD]] through [[Bluetooth]]. In Japan, the device was available as of [[December 7]], [[2006]]. The device was available in North America as of December[http://ps3.ign.com/articles/740/740460p1.html]. It uses 2 1.5 volt AA batteries.
Since the remote communicates with the console using Bluetooth, which utilizes [[radio waves]], the device does not need to be pointed at the console to function; as is the case with traditional [[infrared]] [[Remote control#Television Remote Controls|remotes]]. However, this fact means that an adapter is needed to use a "universal" infra-red remote control on the PS3.
{{-}}

== Memory Card Adaptor ==

The [[PlayStation 3]] '''Memory Card Adaptor''' (CECHZM1) is a device that allows data to be transferred from a [[PlayStation]] memory card or a [[PlayStation 2]] memory card to the PlayStation 3's [[hard disk]]. At launch, the device did not support transferring saved game files back to a memory card, but the upon release of the PlayStation 3 system software version 1.80, the user is now able to save and/or transfer PSOne and PS2 game saves from the PS3 directly onto a physical Memory Card via the adaptor. PlayStation 2 saved game files can also be transferred between PlayStation 3 users via other current memory card formats. The device connects to the PlayStation 3's USB port on one end through a USB Mini-B cable (not included with adaptor, but it was included with the console itself), and features a legacy PlayStation 2 memory card port on the other end. The adaptor was available for purchase simultaneously with the console's launch. The Memory Card Adaptor was released on [[25 May]] [[2007]] in the UK.
{{-}}


== AC adapter charging kit ==
AC adapter Charging Kit can charge Sixaxis and/or DualShock 3 controller, official Bluetooth headset and the soon to be released Wireless Keypad. The kit can also charge the PSP-2000 and PSP-3000. AC Charger uses a wall power plug so you don't need to have a PS3 running to charge the hardware.

== Wireless Keypad ==
[[Image:PS3_Wireless_Keypad_01.jpg|thumb|200px|Promotional Image of Wireless Keypad]]
A wireless keypad peripheral <ref name="Keypad">{{cite web|last=Crecente|first=Brian|date=[[2008-08-20]]|url=http://kotaku.com/5039502/ps3-wireless-keypad-ships-this-holiday-worldwide|title= PS3 Wireless keypad ships this holiday worldwide|publisher=Kotaku|accessdate=2008-08-20}}</ref> was launched in Europe on November 28, 2008.<ref>http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=308073</ref> It will be launched in North America in early December 2008, and some time late 2008 in Japan. The keypad can be connected to a PlayStation 3 via Bluetooth, or connected to a controller. 

The keypad features two shortcut buttons, a Communication Button and a Message Box Button, letting users jump to pre-set features on the XMB such as the Friends screen and Message Box during game play.
The Touch Pad Button allows PS3 users to use the surface of the keypad as a touch pad, allowing them to move the pointer whilst web browsing by sliding their fingers around the keypad surface.
The Bluetooth-enabled device will support and all typing on the PlayStation 3, including text chatting in ''Home'' and ''LittleBigPlanet'' support.

== AV cables ==
[[Image:High Definition Multimedia Interface Plug.jpg|thumb|HDMI cable for Full HD picture and 7.1ch sound (+ allows PAL[576i] standard-definition display).]]
[[Image:RCA Connector (photo).jpg|thumb|Entry line cable (RCA) for standard-definition display and 2.0ch sound (analog video and audio).]]
Both official [[HDMI]] cables and standard HDMI cables (ver 1.2 / 1.3) are also compatible. An official component AV cable set is also available. Also, composite, S-Video, [[RGB]] [[SCART]] and component cables for the PlayStation 2 are all compatible with the PlayStation 3, as they utilize the same "[[AV Multi|A/V Multi Out]]" port.<ref>[http://manuals.playstation.net/document/en/ps3/current/settings/videooutput.html PlayStation 3 User's Guide - Video Output Settings]</ref>

On the audio part, AV cables connected to the "AV Multi out" allows 2.0ch ([[stereo]]) only, optical "Digital out" allows both 2.0ch and 5.1ch and "HDMI out" (Ver.1.3) supports 2.0ch, 5.1ch and 7.1ch.

Units sold in NTSC regions are SD/ED NTSC, 720p, 1080i and 1080p compliant, while those available  in PAL regions are compatible with SD/ED PAL, 720p, 1080i and 1080p. A NTSC system (480i/480p) cannot output PAL (576i/576p) games and DVDs ([[DVD-Video]]/[[DVD-Audio]]) - however PAL units can display "All Region" NTSC DVDs. This regional lock does not affect HD output (720p/1080i/1080p) - except for [[Blu-ray Disc]] movies.
