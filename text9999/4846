'''Chi Chi LaRue''' (born '''Larry David Paciotti''' on [[November 8]], [[1959]] in [[Hibbing, Minnesota|Hibbing]], [[Minnesota]], [[United States]]) is a highly-regarded [[film director|director]] of [[gay pornography|gay]] and [[bisexual pornographic movie|bisexual pornography]]. He has also directed under the names "Lawrence David" and "Taylor Hudson." As the LaRue [[persona]] is achieved through Paciotti donning [[drag (clothing)|drag]], LaRue is alternately referred to as "he" and "she."

== Career == 
LaRue's earliest notice came when he moved to the [[Minneapolis-Saint Paul|Twin Cities]] area and began performing in drag as one-half of "The Weather Gals", a "hag drag" revue. When he moved to [[California]] with a friend, his vast knowledge about porn and the porn industry got him hired at [[Catalina Video]] as an administrative assistant and publicist.  LaRue worked at Catalina during the initial onslaught of the [[AIDS]] crisis, when many of the producers and directors in the gay porn industry were ill or dying.<ref>[http://www.indyweek.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A16264 "Sex Becomes Him: How one portly, effeminate lad from Minnesota rose to the top of the gay porn industry"]</ref> This created an opportunity for new producers like LaRue, who persuaded Catalina management to allow him to direct full-length videos. 

LaRue has become a well known and prolific [[gay porn]] director. Having helmed literally hundreds of gay porn films since 1988, LaRue in 2003 also began to direct straight porn for colossus [[Vivid Video]] and quickly became a favorite among female stars, particularly [[Jenna Jameson]]. For some time, LaRue divided his attention between [[Vivid Video]] and his own '''Rascal Video''', distributed by another company he co-owns, [[Channel 1 Releasing]]. Apart from the popular Live And Raw <!-- formatting style from http://www.channel1releasing.com/?option=com_wrapper&Itemid=109, both in text on site and in logo --> live streaming video feeds (which included the now-shuttered Live And Raw Hotel), LaRue is expanding his offerings to include branded line of dildos and other toys, as well as books, calendars and other merchandise.<ref>[http://www.channel1releasing.com/index.php?option=com_custompages&Itemid=166 Channel 1 Releasing]</ref>

=== Safe sex stance ===
LaRue, a safe sex advocate, made waves when, in 2006, he announced he would no longer produce films for Vivid Video because they were filming and producing content featuring actors and actresses having sex without [[condoms]]. <ref>[http://www.avn.com/index.php?Primary_Navigation=Articles&Action=View_Article&Content_ID=258091 "Chi Chi LaRue leaves Vivid"]</ref>

The "directrix" also appeared in a companion [[Documentary film|documentary]] titled ''[[Thinking XXX]]'' which ran on [[HBO]]. Other recent documentary appearances include ''Porno Valley'' (another HBO series) and ''Cycles of Porn: Sex/Life L.A., Part 2'' (from director Jochen Hick).
