'''Burton Road Metrolink Station''' is a future station which is to be constructed on one of the new lines on the [[Manchester Metrolink]] [[light rail]] public transport system in Manchester, [[England]],[[United Kingdom|UK]]. 

The station is part of Phase 3B of the "Big Bang" extension project which will increase the Metrolink network size by {{mi to km |47| spell=commonwealth | wiki=yes}}. Among other proposals, this project plans to re-open a disused railway through the suburbs of south Manchester to operate a light rail service into Manchester City Centre.<ref name="BBC-backontrack">{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/manchester/content/articles/2009/05/13/130509_metrolink_map_plan_b_feature.shtml |title=Metrolink: back on track?|date=2009-05-13|publisher=BBC Manchester|accessdate=2009-05-17}}</ref>

Located on the west side of Burton Road in Withington, the new stop on this stretch of line will be in a cutting.

==History==
[[File:Midland to Manchester.jpg|thumb|left|Midland Railway lines in Manchester]]
In 1880 the [[Midland Railway]] opened the new [[Template:Manchester Lines South|Manchester South District line]] which ran from [[Manchester Central railway station|Manchester Central Station]].<ref name="sussexhelm1">{{cite book |last1=Sussex|first1=Gay |last2=Helm|first2=Peter |title=Looking Back at Withington and Didsbury |publisher=Willow Publishing |location=Timperley |date=1988 |pages=inside front cover |isbn=0946361258 |accessdate=2008-12-26}}</ref> The line was later operated by the [[Cheshire Lines Committee]]. Under [[British Rail]] operation, the line closed in 1967 as part of the [[Beeching Axe]]. 

Plans to re-open the line for light rail use have been proposed since the early 1980s,<ref name="brochure1">{{cite |author=Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Executive |title=Light Rapid Transit in Greater Manchester |publisher=GMPTE |date=1984}} - publicity brochure</ref> but these proposals failed several times due to problems securing funding.<ref name="bbc-2004-scraps">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/3910235.stm|title=Government scraps trams extension|date=2004-07-20|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2008-12-28}}</ref> Revised plans put forward in 2006 only allowed for the line to be opened as far as [[St. Werburgh's Road Metrolink station|St. Werburgh's Road]] in Chorlton.<ref name="bbc-2006-littlebang">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/manchester/content/articles/2006/06/23/230606_metrolink_decision_messageboard_feature.shtml|title=Metrolink - the little Bang?|date=2006-07-07|publisher=BBC Manchester|accessdate=2008-12-28}}</ref> 

In 2009, following the failure of the [[Greater Manchester Transport Innovation Fund]], revised transport funding was announced by the [[United Kingdom Government|Govenment]] which would facilitate a major expansion of the Metrolink network, including the re-opening of the former Midland line and stations as far as [[East Didsbury railway station|East Didsbury]].<ref name="BBC-backontrack"/><ref name="BBC-ext-May-09">

==Metrolink extension==
{{Manchester Didsbury Metrolink}}
It is now planned to re-open the former CLC line after the junction with the [[Manchester, South Junction and Altrincham Railway|Altrincham line]] at [[Trafford Bar Metrolink station|Trafford Bar]], and to run a light rail service from East Didsbury, through Burton Road, into Manchester. 

Burton Road station will be a newly-constructed stop on the South Manchester line, rather than a re-opened station. Passengers will be able to travel by rail bewteen Manchester and East Didsbury for the first time since the line was closed in 1967.

The date for the station's opening has not been confirmed as yet, but it will be post 2011.
