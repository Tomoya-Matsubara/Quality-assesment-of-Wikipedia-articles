'''Lewis''' ({{lang-gd|'''Le<U+00F2>dhas'''}} {{pronounced|<U+028E><U+0254><U+02D0>.<U+0259>s<U+032A>}}) or the '''Isle of Lewis''' ('''''{{lang|gd|Eilean Le<U+00F2>dhais}}''''' {{pronounced|elan <U+028E><U+0254><U+02D0>.<U+0259><U+0283>}}), is the northern part of the largest island of the Western Isles (''{{lang|gd|Na h-Eileanan Siar}}'') or [[Outer Hebrides]] of [[Scotland]]. Another name usually used in a cultural or poetic context is '''Eilean an Fhraoich''' ({{pronounced|elan <U+0259>n<U+0334><U+032A> <U+027E><U+026F><U+02D0>x}}), ''{{lang|en|The Heather Isle}}''. The southern part of the island is called [[Harris]] (''{{lang|gd|Na Hearadh}}''). The two names however refer to the two parts of the same island despite the use of the terms 'Isle of Lewis' and 'Isle of Harris'.

Lewis is, in general, the lower lying part of [[Lewis and Harris]], with Harris being more mountainous. The flatter, more fertile land means Lewis contains the only town, [[Stornoway]], and three-quarters of the population of the Western Isles. Beyond human habitation, the island's diverse habitats are home to an assortment of flora and fauna, such as the [[golden eagle]], [[red deer]] and [[Pinniped|seal]]s and are recognised in a number of conservation areas. 

Lewis is of [[Presbyterian]] tradition with a rich history, having once been part of the Norse [[Kingdom of Mann and the Isles]]. Today, life is very different to elsewhere in Scotland with [[Sabbath in Christianity|Sabbath]] observance, the [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]] language and peat cutting retaining more importance than elsewhere. Lewis has a rich cultural heritage as can be seen from its [[Hebridean Myths and Legends|myths and legends]] as well as the local literary and musical traditions.

== History ==
{{main|History of the Outer Hebrides}}
The first evidence of [[human]] habitation on Lewis is found in [[peat]] samples which indicate that about 8,000 years ago, much of the native woodland was torched to make way for grassland to allow [[deer]] to graze. The earliest [[archaeology|archaeological]] remains date from about 5,000 years ago. At that time, people began to settle in permanent farms rather than following their herds.  The small houses of these people have been found throughout the [[Western Isles]], in particular, at [[Dail Mhor]], [[Carloway]] in Lewis. [[Image:Callanish standing stones 1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Callanish stone circle]]]]The more striking great monuments of this period are the temples and communal burial cairns at places like [[Calanais]]. The [[Scots]] are recorded as arriving from around 1AD, bringing their still present [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]] language with them.<ref name="history1">Macdonald, D. (1978). ''Lewis: A History of the Island''. Edinburgh: Gordon Wright</ref>

About 500 BC, island society moved into the [[Iron Age]]. The buildings became larger and more prominent, culminating in the [[broch]]s <U+2013> circular, dry-stone towers belonging to the local chieftains <U+2013> testifying to the uncertain nature of life then.  The best remaining example of a broch in Lewis is at [[Dun Carloway|Dun Charlabhagh]]. As [[Christianity]] began to spread through the islands in the sixth and later centuries, following [[Saint Columba|Columban]] missionaries, Lewis was inhabited by the [[Picts]].<ref name="history1">Macdonald, D. (1978). ''Lewis: A History of the Island''. Edinburgh: Gordon Wright</ref>

[[Image:UigChessmen SelectionOfKings.jpg|thumb|left|Two kings and two queens from the [[Lewis chessmen]] at the [[British Museum]]]]In the 9th century AD, the [[Vikings]] began to settle on Lewis, after years of raiding from the sea. The Norse invaders intermarried with local families and abandoned their pagan beliefs.  At this time, most buildings changed their forms from being round to rectangular, following the Scandinavian style.  At this time, Lewis was part of the [[Kingdom of Mann and the Isles]] and officially part of [[Norway]]. The [[Lewis chessmen]], which were found on the island in 1831, date from the time of Viking rule. The people were called the [[Norse Gaels|Gall-Ghaidheil]], the <U+2018>Foreigner Gaels', reflecting their mixed Scandinavian/Gaelic background, and probably their bilingual speech.<ref name = "http://www.cne-siar.gov.uk/factfile/cultureheritage/history/index.htm">[http://www.cne-siar.gov.uk/factfile/cultureheritage/history/index.htm  Local Authority Web Site]</ref> The Norse language persists in many island placenames and some personal names to this day, although the latter are fairly evenly spread across Scottish Gaeldom.

Lewis(and the rest of the Western Isles) became part of Scotland once more in 1266 following the [[Treaty of Perth]] when it was ceded by the Kingdom of Norway. Under Scottish rule, the [[Lord of the Isles|Lordship of the Isles]] emerged as the most important power in north-western Scotland by the 14th century.  The Lords of the Isles were based on [[Islay]], but controlled all of the [[Hebrides]].  They were descended from [[Somerled]] (Somhairle) Mac Gillibride, a Gall-Gaidheil lord who had held the Hebrides and West Coast two hundred years earlier.  Control of Lewis itself was initially exercised by the Macleod clan but after years of feuding and open warfare between and even within local clans, the lands of [[Clan MacLeod]] were forfeited to the crown in 1597 and were awarded by [[King James VI]] to a group of [[Lowland]] colonists known as the [[Fife adventurers]] in an attempt to [[anglicise]] the islands. However the adventurers were unsuccessful and possession eventually passed to the Mackenzies of Kintail in 1609 when Coinneach, Lord MacKenzie, bought out the [[Scottish Lowlands|lowlanders]].<ref name="history1">Macdonald, D. (1978). ''Lewis: A History of the Island''. Edinburgh: Gordon Wright</ref>

[[Image:Admiralty-yacht-HMS-Iolaire-ship-Amalthaea-1908.jpg|thumb|right| [[Admiralty]] yacht [[Her Majesty's Ship|HMS]] ''[[Iolaire]]'' (named as ''Amalthaea'' in 1908 photo).]]Following the [[Jacobite rising#The 'Forty-Five'|1745 rebellion]], and [[Bonnie Prince Charlie|Prince Charles Edward Stewart]]'s flight to France, the use of Gaelic was discouraged, rents were demanded in cash rather than kind, and the wearing of folk dress was made illegal.  Emigration to the New World increasingly became an escape for those who could afford it during the latter half of the century. Lewis was bought by [[Sir James Matheson]] in 1844, but subsequent famine and land reform forced vast numbers off their lands, and increased again the flood of emigrants. Lewis was the site of numerous 'land struggles' which have recently been commemorated in modern cairn-style monuments in various villages.<ref name="history1">Macdonald, D. (1978). ''Lewis: A History of the Island''. Edinburgh: Gordon Wright</ref>

During the [[First World War]], thousands of islanders served in the forces, many losing their lives, including over 200 naval reservists from the island who were returning home after the war when the Admiralty yacht ''HMY [[Iolaire]]'', sank within sight of Stornoway harbour.  Many servicemen from Lewis served in the [[Royal Navy|Royal]] and [[Merchant Navy]] during the [[Second World War]] and again, many lives were lost. Following the war, many more inhabitants emigrated to the Americas and mainland Scotland.

=== Historical sites ===
The Isle of Lewis has a variety of locations of historical and archaeological interest including:
* [[Calanais|Callanish]] standing stones;
* [[Dun Carloway]] Broch;
* [[Iron Age]] houses near Bostadh ([[Great Bernera]]);
* The [[Garenin]] Blackhouse Village in [[Carloway]] and the Black House at [[Arnol]];
* [[Bragar]] whale bone arch;
* [[St. Columba]]'s church in [[Aignish]];
* [[Teampull Mholuaidh]] in [[Ness, Outer Hebrides|Ness]];
* [[Clach an Truiseil]] [[monolith]];
*   Clach Na Thursa, [[Carloway]]
* [[Bonnie Prince Charlie]]'s Monument, Arnish;
* [[Lews Castle]];
* [[Butt of Lewis]] cliffs and [[lighthouse]];
* [[D<U+00F9>n <U+00C8>istean]], a small island which is the ancestral home of the Lewis Morrisons.
There are also numerous 'lesser' stone circles and the remains of five further [[broch]]s.

== Geography and geology ==
[[Image:Wfm lewis landsat.jpg|thumb|right|Satellite photograph of Lewis and Harris]]
A cross-section of Lewis would see mostly sandy beaches backed by dunes and [[machair]] on the east coast, giving way to an expansive peat covered plateau in the centre of the island.  The Atlantic coastline is markedly more rugged and is mostly rocky cliffs broken by small coves and beaches.  The more fertile nature of the eastern side spurred the majority of population there, including the largest (and only) town, [[Stornoway]]. Aside from the village of Achmore in the centre of the island, all settlements are on the coast.<ref name="flora">Pankhurst R.J. & Mullin, J.M. (1991) ''Flora of the Outer Hebrides'', London: HMSO</ref>

[[Image:UigLoch.jpg|thumb|left|Looking towards the Uplands in the centre of the Island of Lewis]]Compared to Harris, Lewis is relatively flat, save in the south-east, where Ben More reaches {{convert|1874|ft|m|abbr=on}}, and in the south-west, where Mealasbhal (1885) is the highest point; but there are only eleven peaks exceeding {{convert|1000|ft|m|abbr=on}} in height.<ref name = "http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Lewis-With-Harris">[http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Lewis-With-Harris  1911 Britannica]</ref> Southern Lewis also has a large number of freshwater lochs compared to the north of the island.

South Lewis, Harris and North Uist collectively is a [[National Scenic Area]], and there are 4 geographical [[Sites of Special Scientific Interest]] (SSSI) on Lewis - Glen Valtos, Cnoc a' Chapuill, Port of Ness and Tolsta Head.<ref name="snhsitelink">[http://gateway.snh.gov.uk/ Scottish National Heritage - Protected Areas]</ref>

The coastline is severely indented into a number of large sea lochs, such as Lochs Resort and Seaforth which form part of the border with Harris, Loch Roag surrounding the island of Great Bernera and Loch Erisort. The principal capes are the Butt of Lewis, in the extreme north, where the cliffs are nearly {{convert|150|ft|m|abbr=on}} high and crowned with a lighthouse, the light of which is visible for 19 m.; Tolsta Head, Tiumpan Head and Cabag Head, on the east; Renish Point, in the extreme south; and, on the west, Toe Head and Gallon Head.<ref name = "http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Lewis-With-Harris">[http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Lewis-With-Harris  1911 Britannica]</ref>The largest island associated with Lewis is Bernera or [[Great Bernera]] in the district of [[Uig, Lewis|Uig]] and is linked to the mainland of Lewis by a bridge opened in 1953.

=== Geology ===
[[Image:Lewis_abandoned.jpg|thumb|right|Abandoned house and croft in SW Lewis, exposed gneiss visible]]Lewis is composed of [[gneiss]] rocks, excepting a patch of [[granite]] near [[Carloway]], small bands of intrusive [[basalt]] at Gress and in Eye Peninsula and some Torridonian [[sandstone]] at Stornoway, Tong, Vatisker and Carloway.<ref name = "http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Lewis-With-Harris">[http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Lewis-With-Harris  1911 Britannica]</ref> Sedimentary rocks cover some low-lying areas aroung the Broad Bay area as well.<ref name="flora">Pankhurst R.J. & Mullin, J.M. (1991) ''Flora of the Outer Hebrides'', London: HMSO</ref>

== Climate ==
Exposure to the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and the [[Gulf Stream]] lead to a cool, moist climate on Lewis. There is little temperature difference between summer and winter, along with significant rainfall and frequent high winds, particularly during the autumn equinox. These winds have led to Lewis being designated a potential site for a significant wind-farm which has caused much controversy amongst the population.

== Nature ==
There are 15 SSSIs on Lewis in the biology category, spread across the island. Additionally, the Lewis Peatlands are recognised by [[Scottish Natural Heritage]] as a [[Special Protection Area]], [[Special Area of Conservation]] and a [[Ramsar Convention|Ramsar]] site, showing their importance as a wetland habitat for migratory and resident bird life.<ref name="snhsitelink">[http://gateway.snh.gov.uk/ Scottish National Heritage - Protected Areas]</ref>

=== Birds ===
[[Image:GoldenEagle3.jpg|thumb|right|[[Golden eagle]]]] Three hundred and twenty seven species of birds have been recorded in the Western Isles and more than 100 breed.  The Islands provide a natural flyway for migrating landbirds to and from their Arctic breeding grounds and a refuge for windblown vagrants from America and northern Europe.  Many species of bird breed in the Western Isles and the surrounding islands, including, most of Britain's [[corncrake]]s which breed on the croftlands of all the islands.<ref name = "http://www.cne-siar.gov.uk/factfile/environment/wildlife.htm">[http://www.cne-siar.gov.uk/factfile/environment/wildlife.htm  Local Authority Web Site]</ref>

Many species of [[seabird]]s inhabit the coastal areas of Lewis, such as [[shag]], [[gannet]]s, [[fulmar]]s, [[Black-legged Kittiwake|kittiwakes]], [[guillemot]]s and the ubiquitous [[seagull]]s. 

In the [[Uig, Lewis|Uig]] hills, it is possible to spot [[golden eagle]]s; it has also been claimed that [[white-tailed eagle]]s have been seen in the area.<ref name = "http://www.isle-of-lewis.com/">[http://www.isle-of-lewis.com/  Isle-of-Lewis.com]</ref> In the [[Pairc]] area, it is possible to see feeding [[oyster catcher]]s and [[curlew]]s. 

A few pairs of [[peregrine falcon]]s survive on coastal cliffs and [[merlin]] and [[buzzard]] are not uncommon anywhere on hill and moor. [[red-throated diver]]s nest on countless small [[tarn]]s and a very few [[black-throated diver]]s on bigger lochs. [[Arctic skua]]s are spreading south from Lewis as far as South Uist but the [[great skua]] is still found breeding only in Lewis, St Kilda, North Rona, the Shiant Isles and Barra Head.<ref name = "http://www.cne-siar.gov.uk/factfile/environment/wildlife.htm">[http://www.cne-siar.gov.uk/factfile/environment/wildlife.htm  Local Authority Web Site]</ref>

An important feature of the winter bird life is the great diversity of wildfowl. A variety of [[duck]], such as [[eider]] and long-tailed are found in the shallow water around Lewis.<ref name = "http://www.cne-siar.gov.uk/factfile/environment/wildlife.htm">[http://www.cne-siar.gov.uk/factfile/environment/wildlife.htm  Local Authority Web Site]</ref>

=== Marine life ===
[[Image:Atlantischer Lachs.jpg|thumb|200px|Atlantic salmon]][[Salmon]] frequent several Lewis rivers after crossing the Atlantic. Many of the fresh-water lochs are home to fish such as [[trout]]. Other freshwater fish present include [[arctic char]], European [[eel]], 3 and 9 spined [[stickleback]]s, thick-lipped [[mullet]] and [[flounder]].

Offshore, it is common to see [[Pinniped|seal]]s, particularly in Stornoway harbour, and with luck, [[dolphin]]s, [[porpoise]]s, [[shark]]s and even the occasional [[whale]] can be encountered.

Occasional [[turtles]], mainly loggerhead and leathery, may be met in coastal waters.<ref name = "http://www.cne-siar.gov.uk/factfile/environment/wildlife.htm">[http://www.cne-siar.gov.uk/factfile/environment/wildlife.htm  Local Authority Web Site]</ref>

=== Land mammals ===
There are only two native land mammals in the Western Isles, red [[deer]] and [[otter]]. The [[rabbit]], blue [[hare]], [[hedgehog]], brown and black [[rat]], [[feral cat]] and [[polecat]] were introduced by man. The origin of [[mouse|mice]] and [[vole]]s is uncertain.<ref name = "http://www.cne-siar.gov.uk/factfile/environment/wildlife.htm">[http://www.cne-siar.gov.uk/factfile/environment/wildlife.htm  Local Authority Web Site]</ref> 
[[American Mink]] are another introduced species (escapees from [[fur farming|fur farms]]) and cause problems for native ground-nesting birds, the local fishing industry and poultry farmers<ref name="http://www.snh.org.uk/scottish/wisles/species.asp">[http://www.snh.org.uk/scottish/wisles/species.asp SNH - Hebridean Mink Project]</ref>.  Due to this impact and following a successful eradication<ref name="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/highlands_and_islands/5306182.stm">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/highlands_and_islands/5306182.stm BBC News]</ref> of the species from the Uists and Barra, the second and ongoing phase of the Hebridean Mink Project aims to rid mink from Lewis and Harris in similar fashion [http://www.snh.org.uk/scottish/wisles/intro.asp].

There are claims that the Stornoway castle grounds are home to [[bat]]s.<ref name="http://www.echoesecology.co.uk/documents/AnIntroductionToTheBatsofScotlandEdition1Dec2006_002.pdf">[http://www.echoesecology.co.uk/documents/AnIntroductionToTheBatsofScotlandEdition1Dec2006_002.pdf  An Introduction to the Bats of Scotland]</ref> In addition, there are farmed animals such as [[sheep]], [[cattle]] and a few [[pig]]s.

=== Reptiles and amphibians ===
[[Image:Dragonfly in Lewis.JPG|thumb|right|[[Dragonfly]] near Valtos, Uig]]In common with [[Ireland]], no [[snakes]] inhabit Lewis<ref>Morris, Dr P. (1984). ''Animals of Britain, Field Guide to the''. London: Reader's Digest Association</ref>, only the [[slow-worm]] which is merely mistaken for a snake. Actually a legless lizard, it is the sole member of its order present. The common [[frog]] may be found in the centre of the island<ref>Morris, Dr P. (1984). ''Animals of Britain, Field Guide to the''. London: Reader's Digest Association</ref> though it, along with any [[newts]] or [[toads]] present are introduced species<ref name = "http://www.cne-siar.gov.uk/factfile/environment/wildlife.htm">[http://www.cne-siar.gov.uk/factfile/environment/wildlife.htm  Local Authority Web Site]</ref>.

=== Insects ===
The island's most famous insect resident is the Scottish [[midge]] which is ever-present near water at certain times of the year. 

During the summer months, several species of [[butterfly|butterflies]] and [[dragonfly|dragon flies]] can be found, especially outwith Stornoway.

The richness of insect-life in Lewis is evident from the fact that carnivorous plants, such as the [[sundew]], thrive in parts of the island.

=== Plant life ===
[[Image:Hebridean Sundew.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sundew]] near Valtos]]The [[machair]] is noted for different species of [[orchid]] and associated vegetation such as various [[grass]]es. Three [[heather]]s; ling, bell heather and cross-leaved heather are predominant in the large areas of [[moorland]] vegetation which also holds large numbers of [[insectivorous]] plants such as [[sundew]]s. The expanse of heather-covered moorland explains the name Eilean an Fhraoich, [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]] for The Heather Isle.<ref name = "http://news.scotsman.com/gaelic.cfm?id=140952005">[http://news.scotsman.com/gaelic.cfm?id=140952005 Scotsman piece with 'Eilean an Fhraoich' translation]</ref>

Lewis was once covered by woodland, but the only natural woods remaining are in small pockets on inland cliffs and on islands within lochs, away from fire and sheep. In recent years, [[Forestry Commission]] plantations of [[spruce]] and [[pine]] were planted; but, most of the pines were destroyed by [[moth]] infestation. The most important mixed woods are those planted around [[Lews Castle]] in Stornoway, dating from the mid 19th century.<ref name = "http://www.cne-siar.gov.uk/factfile/environment/flora.htm">[http://www.cne-siar.gov.uk/factfile/environment/flora.htm  Local Authority Web Site]</ref>

== Politics and government ==

Now called [[Comhairle nan Eilean Siar]], and still centralised in [[Stornoway]], Lewis remains part of the authority's area.

Lewis is home to vast majority of the Western Isles electorate and as such 6 of the 9 multi-member council wards are within Lewis and one is shared with Harris. 22 councillors are effectively elected by Lewis residents using the [[Single Transferable Vote]] system, and following the 2007 elections 19 are independents, 1 has Labour and 2 SNP party affiliation.<ref name = "http://www.cne-siar.gov.uk/members/members.htm">[http://www.cne-siar.gov.uk/members/members.htm Comhairle nan Eilean Siar - Council Members]</ref>

The Isle of Lewis is in the [[Highlands and Islands (Scottish Parliament electoral region)|Highlands electoral region]] and is part of the identical [[Western Isles (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Western Isles]] Scottish Parliamentiary and [[Na h-Eileanan an Iar (UK Parliament constituency)|Na h-Eileanan an Iar]] Westminster constituencies, both currently represented by members of the [[Scottish National Party]] (SNP) and previously held by members of the [[Scottish Labour Party|Labour Party]] before the respective elections.

=== Current representatives ===
* Scottish Parliament: [[Alasdair Allan]] [[Member of the Scottish Parliament|MSP]] (SNP), succeeding [[Alasdair Morrison]] (Labour)
* UK Parliament: [[Angus MacNeil]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]], succeeding [[Calum MacDonald]] (Labour)

== Demographics ==
Lewis' main settlement, the only [[burgh]] on the Outer Hebrides, is [[Stornoway]] (''Ste<U+00F2>rnabhagh''), from which [[ferry|ferries]] sail to [[Ullapool]] on the Scottish mainland. In the 2001 census Lewis had a usually resident population of 18,489. 

The island's settlements are on or near the [[coast]]s or [[sea loch]]s, being particularly concentrated on the north east coast.  The interior of the island is a large area of moorland from which [[peat]] was traditionally cut as fuel, although this practice has become rarer.  The southern part of the island, adjoining Harris, is more mountainous with inland [[loch]]s.  The island of Bernera ([[Great Bernera]]) in the district of [[Uig, Lewis|Uig]] is linked to the mainland of Lewis by a bridge opened in 1953 .

=== Parishes and districts of Lewis ===
* There are four parishes: [[Barvas]] (''Barabhas''), [[Lochs]] (''Na Lochan''), Stornoway (''Ste<U+00F2>rnabhagh''), and [[Uig]] on which the original civil registration districts were based. The district of [[Carloway]] (after the village of that name) which hitherto had fallen partly within the parishes of Lochs and Uig, became a separate civil registration district in 1859 . 
* The districts of Lewis are Ness (''Nis''), [[Carloway]] (''C<U+00E0>rlabhagh''), [[Back, Outer Hebrides|Back]], Lochs (''Na Lochan''), Park (''{{lang|gd|A' Ph<U+00E0>irc}}''), Point (''{{lang|gd|An Rubha}}''), Stornoway, and Uig. These designations are traditional and in use by the entire population.
* For civil registration purposes Lochs (''{{lang|gd|Na Lochan}}'') is nowadays split into North Lochs (''{{lang|gd|Na Lochan a Tuath}}'') and South Lochs (''{{lang|gd|Na Lochan a Deas}}'').
* The [[West Side, Outer Hebrides|West Side]] is a generic designation for the area covering the villages from Arnol to Shawbost (''{{lang|gd|Siabost}}''). 

It is claimed that the site of the Stornoway War Memorial was chosen as it would be visible from at least one location in each of the four parishes; therefore, it is further claimed that it is possible to see all four parishes of Lewis from the top of the monument.<ref name = "Stornoway Historical Society">[http://www.stornowayhistoricalsociety.org.uk/features/warmem/  Stornoway Historical Society].</ref>
<!-- Comment The seven districts of Lewis are represented in the the unofficial [[Flag of Lewis]]. The flag consists of seven equal horizontal stripes of white (top and bottom) alternating with blue, with a [[Flag terminology|chevron]] depicting a white [[Nordic cross]] on a red field. The seven stripes represent the seven districts while the Nordic cross alludes to the area's [[Norse]] heritage. - Removed due to being garbage, but not deleted just in case proof of this can be found when Elvis rides in to Stornoway on the back of the Loch Ness Monster.-->

=== Settlements ===
While Lewis has only one town, [[Stornoway]], with a population of approx 8,000, there are also several large villages, such as [[North Tolsta]], [[Carloway]] and [[Leurbost]] with significant populations as well as areas such as [[Laxdale]], [[Sandwick, Lewis|Sandwick]] and [[Holm, Lewis|Holm]] which, although still de-facto villages, have now become quasi-suburbs of Stornoway. The population of the greater-Stornoway area would be nearer 12,000.

The following is a non-exhaustive list of villages in Lewis according to their location:

== Economy ==
=== Industry ===
[[Image:Arnish Industrial Estate.jpg|thumb|right|Arnish Industrial Estate]]Traditional industries on Lewis are [[crofting]], [[fishing]] and [[weaving]]. Though historically important they are currently in decline and crofting in particular is little more than a subsistence venture today.

Despite the name the [[Harris tweed]] industry is today focused in Lewis with the major finishing mills in Shawbost and Stornoway. Every length of cloth produced is stamped with the official [[Globus cruciger|Orb]] symbol, [[trademark]]ed by the Harris Tweed Association in 1909, when Harris Tweed was defined as "hand-spun, hand-woven and dyed by the crofters and cottars in the Outer Hebrides"; Machine-spinning and vat dyeing have since replaced hand methods, and only weaving is now conducted in the home, under the governance of the Harris Tweed Authority, established by an Act of Parliament in 1993. Harris Tweed is now defined as "hand woven by the islanders at their homes in the Outer Hebrides, finished in the islands of Harris, Lewis, North Uist, Benbecula, South Uist and Barra and their several purtenances (The Outer Hebrides) and made from pure virgin wool dyed and spun in the Outer Hebrides."<ref>[http://www.harristweed.org/fabric_hist.htm Harris Tweed Authority, "Fabric History"], retrieved 21 May 2007.</ref>

Aside from the concentration of industry and services in the Stornoway area many of the historical sites have associated visitor centres, shops or cafes.<ref name="callanish">[http://www.calanaisvisitorcentre.co.uk/ Calanais Stones Visitor Centre]</ref> There is a pharmaceutical plant near [[Breasclete]] which specialises in [[fatty acid]] research.<ref name="scottishenterprise">[http://apps.scottish-enterprise.com/SupplierDirectory/ViewSupplierInContext.aspx?SupplierGuid=affbf28b-44cd-45c5-aa05-0eaf00a5312b&displayID=3483 Scottish Enterprise - Life Sciences Directory]</ref>

The main fishing fleet (and associated shoreside services) in Stornoway is somewhat reduced from its heyday, but many smaller boats perform inshore creel fishing and operate from smaller, local harbours right around Lewis. [[Fish farms]] are present in many of the sea lochs and along with the onshore processing and transportation required the industry as a whole is a major employer.

=== Commerce ===
Stornoway is the commercial centre of Lewis, there are several national chains with shops in the town as well as numerous local businesses. Outwith Stornoway, many villages have an all-purpose shop (often combined with a post-office). Some villages have more than one, with these usually being specialist stores such as pharmacies or petrol stations.

Itinerant, travelling shops also tour the island visiting some of the more remote locations. The ease of transport to Stornoway and the advent of the Internet have led to many of the village shops closing in recent times.  

=== Transport ===
[[Image:Stornoway Airport.jpg|thumb|right|Stornoway Airport, a former [[NATO]] base]][[Image:Mv isle of lewis summer isles.jpg|thumb|right|MV ''Isle of Lewis'']]A daily (except Sunday) [[Caledonian Macbrayne]] [[ferry]] ([[MV Isle of Lewis|MV ''Isle of Lewis'']]) sails from [[Stornoway]] to [[Ullapool]] on the Scottish mainland, taking 2 hours 40 minutes connecting Lewis with the mainland. There are an average of two return crossings a day, with an increase and reduction in frequency in summer and winter months respectively.  As ferry traffic has increased, a second ship (MV ''Muirneag'') now provides a single early morning sailing to carry most of the island's freight lorries. Other ferries sailing from Harris are easily accessible by road enabling transport to [[Skye]] and [[Uist]].

Suggestions for the possibility of an undersea tunnel linking Lewis to the Scottish mainland were raised in early 2007. One of the possible routes, between Stornoway and Ullapool, would be over {{convert|40|mi|km}} long and hence become the longest road tunnel in the world;<ref name = "http://www.stornowaytoday.co.uk/ViewArticle2.aspx?SectionID=2629&ArticleID=2019367">[http://www.stornowaytoday.co.uk/ViewArticle2.aspx?SectionID=2629&ArticleID=2019367  Stornoway Today]</ref><ref name = "http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/transport/article2245144.ece">[http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/transport/article2245144.ece ''The Independent'']</ref> however, shorter routes would be possible.

Stornoway is the public transport hub of Lewis with bus service links to Point, Ness, Back and Tolsta, Uig, the West Side, Lochs and [[Tarbert, Harris]]. These services are provided by the local authority and several private operators as well as some community-run organisations.

[[Stornoway Airport]] is {{convert|2|mi|km}} away from the town itself, and is located next to the village of [[Melbost]]. From here services operate to [[Aberdeen]], [[Benbecula]], [[Edinburgh]], [[Inverness]] and [[Glasgow]], with flights from [[British Airways]] franchisee [[Loganair]], [[Eastern Airways]] and [[Highland Airways]]. The airport is also the base of a [[HM Coastguard]] Search & Rescue [[Sikorsky S-92]] helicopter, and was previously home to [[RAF Stornoway]].

=== Peats ===
[[Image:Peat-Stack in Ness, Outer Hebrides, Scotland.jpg|thumb|right|A [[peat]] stack in Ness]][[Peat]] is still cut as a fuel in many areas of Lewis. Peat is usually cut in late spring with a tool called a peat knife or tosg (sometimes toirsgian, or tairsgeir) which has a long wooden handle with an angled blade on one end. The peat bank is first cleared of heather turfs. The peat, now exposed, is cut using the peat knife and the peats thrown out on the bank to dry. A good peat cutter can cut 1000 peats in a day.<ref name = "http://www.ambaile.org.uk/en/education/crofting/src8.jsp">[http://www.ambaile.org.uk/en/education/crofting/src8.jsp  Am Baile Education - Crofting]</ref>

Once dried,the peats are carted to the croft and built into a large stack. These often resembled the shape of the croft house - broad, curved at each end and tapered to a point about 2 metres high. They varied in length from about 4 to 14 metres. Peat stacking also follows local customs and a well built peat stack can be a work of art. Peat stacks provide additional shelter to houses. A croft can burn as many as 15,000 - 18,000 peats in a year.<ref name = "http://www.ambaile.org.uk/en/education/crofting/src8.jsp">[http://www.ambaile.org.uk/en/education/crofting/src8.jsp  Am Baile Education - Crofting]</ref>

The odour of the peat-smoke, especially in winter time, can add to the general atmosphere of the island. While peat burning still goes on, there has been a significant decline in recent years as people move to other, less labour-intensive forms of heating; however, it remains an important symbol of island life.

== Religion ==
[[Image:St Columbas Church, Aiginis, Isle of Lewis.jpg|thumb|right|St Columba's Church, [[Aignish]], Isle of Lewis]]Religion is important in Lewis, with much of the population belonging to the [[Free Church]] and [[Church of Scotland]] (both [[Presbyterian]] in tradition). The [[Sabbath in Christianity|Sabbath]] (i.e., Sunday) is generally observed with most shops and licensed premises closed on that day, although there is a scheduled air service to mainland Scotland. While Presbyterianism dominates Lewis, other denominations and other religions have a presence with a [[Catholic]] church, a [[Mormon]] church and a [[Jehovah's Witness]] kingdom hall all present in Stornoway.

<!-- This section is largely copied from Outer Hebrides -->
The [[Christianity|Christian]] religion has deep roots in the Western Isles, but owing mainly to the different allegiances of the clans in the past, the people in the northern islands (Lewis, Harris, North Uist) have historically been predominantly [[Protestantism|Protestant]] ([[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]]), and those of the southern islands (Benbecula, South Uist, Barra) predominantly [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]]. There are also small [[Scottish Episcopal Church|Episcopalian]] congregations in Lewis, though many of their members originate outside the islands.

The northern parts of the Western Isles (particularly Lewis and Harris) have been described as the last bastion of fundamentalist [[Calvinism]] in Britain<ref name = "http://www.guardian.co.uk/religion/Story/0,,1750597,00.html">[http://www.guardian.co.uk/religion/Story/0,,1750597,00.html  Guardian]</ref> with large numbers of inhabitants belonging to the [[Free Church of Scotland (post 1900)|Free Church of Scotland]] or the still more conservative [[Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland]]. Services in the [[Free Church]], the [[Free Presbyterian Church]] and some congregations of the [[Church of Scotland]] do not use instrumental music or any songs other than the metrical [[Psalms]].

It has also generally been considered unacceptable for people to appear in church improperly dressed, although this is slowly changing. Violations of this nature might include the failure by women to wear a hat, or trousers being worn instead of a skirt, or the wearing of informal clothing such as jeans.

The local council refused in December 2005 to conduct ceremonies for same-sex couples wishing to register under the [[Civil Partnerships Act 2004]]. <ref name = "http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/4543274.stml">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/4543274.stm  BBC]</ref>

== Education ==
{{See also|Education in Scotland}}
School education in Lewis is under the remit of Comhairle nan Eilean Siar, there are a total of 23 schools<ref name="Local Authority Education Dept.">[http://www.cne-siar.gov.uk/education/lewisaddresses.htm Local Authority Education Dept.]</ref> covering the 5-18 age range.  Unusual features are the prevalence of [[Gaelic medium unit|Gaelic medium education]] (offered in 15 of 22 primary schools<ref name="Local Authority - Gaelic Medium">[http://www.cne-siar.gov.uk/gme/stats.html Local Authority - Gaelic Medium]</ref>) and the 5 2-year secondary schools in communities outside Stornoway.  Pupils who attend the rural 2-year secondaries then move to the [[Nicolson Institute]], the only six-year secondary school on the island.  The large number of village schools lead to necessarily small rolls, and further recent falls in pupil numbers have led to plans being drawn up for closures including all of the rural secondary departments.<ref name="BBC News">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/highlands_and_islands/6960478.stm BBC News]</ref> The closure plans have been deferred pending a full review<ref name="BBC News">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/highlands_and_islands/6964894.stm BBC News]</ref>, but upcoming changes to the curriculum (a change to a 3 year junior secondary structure) would seem to place the rural secondaries under threat of change if nothing else.

Stornoway is home to a small campus of the [[University of Stirling]], teaching nursing, which is based in Ospadal nan Eilean (Western Isles Hospital).  There is also a further education college, [[Lews Castle College]], which is part of the [[UHI Millennium Institute]].  The college is the umbrella organisation for other vocational and community education, offered in several rural learning centres as well as on the main campus and covering subjects such as basic computer skills, Gaelic language classes and maritime qualifications.<ref name="lewscastlecollege">[http://www.lews.uhi.ac.uk/centres/index.html Lews Castle College - Learning Centres]</ref>

== Culture and sport ==
=== Language ===
[[Image:Garenin.jpg|thumb|right|Garenin [[Black house|Black House]] Village]]Lewis has a linguistic heritage rooted in [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]] and [[Old Norse]], which both continue to influence life in Lewis. Today, both Gaelic and English are spoken in Lewis, but in day to day life, a hybrid of English and Gaelic ([[Highland English]]) is very common.<ref name = "http://www.linguae-celticae.org/dateien/Gaidhlig_Local_Studies_Vol_15_Steornabhagh_Ed_II.pdf">[http://www.linguae-celticae.org/dateien/Gaidhlig_Local_Studies_Vol_15_Steornabhagh_Ed_II.pdf Linguae-Celticae.Org]</ref> As a result of the Gaelic influence, the Lewis accent is frequently considered to sound more [[Ireland|Irish]], [[Wales|Welsh]] and even [[North America]]n than stereotypically Scottish in some quarters. The Gaelic culture in the Western Isles is more prominent than in any other part of Scotland. Gaelic is still the language of choice amongst many islanders and around 60% of islanders speak Gaelic, whilst 70% of the resident population have some knowledge of Gaelic (including reading, writing, speaking or a combination of the three). Most signposts on the islands are written in both English and G<U+00E0>idhlig and much day-to-day business is carried out in the Gaelic language.<ref name = "http://www.cne-siar.gov.uk/factfile/cultureheritage/index.htm">[http://www.cne-siar.gov.uk/factfile/cultureheritage/index.htm  Local Authority Web Site]</ref> Almost all of the Gaelic speakers are bilingual.

Most of the place names in Lewis and Harris come from Old Norse. The name Lewis is the English spelling of the Gaelic ''Le<U+00F2>dhas'' which comes from the [[Old Norse]] ''Lj<U+00F3><U+00F0>h<U+00FA>s'', as Lewis is named in [[medieval]] [[Norway|Norwegian]] maps of the island. ''Lj<U+00F3><U+00F0>h<U+00FA>s'' translates from [[Old Norse]] to English as ''Home of the Poet'' (Lj<U+00F3><U+00F0> = Poet, h<U+00FA>s = house). The 12th century ruler of the Island, ''Leod'', taking his name from the Norse word for Poet.{{Fact|date=October 2007}}

=== Media and the arts ===
Lewis has been home to, or inspired, many writers. As well as regularly playing host to the [[Royal National Mod]], there are annual local mods. Stornoway Castle Green hosts the annual 3 day [[Hebridean Celtic Festival]] in July, attracting over 10,000 visitors. The festival includes events such as ceilidhs, dances and special concerts featuring storytelling, song and music with performers from all round the Isles and beyond. 

The radio station [[Isles FM]] is based in Stornoway and broadcasts on 103FM, featuring a mixture of [[Scottish Gaelic language|Gaelic]] and English programming. The town is also home to a studio operated by [[BBC Radio nan G<U+00E0>idheal]], and Studio Alba, an independent television studio from where the Gaelic [[TV channel]] [[TeleG]] is broadcast.

The [[Stornoway Gazette]] is the main local paper, covering Stornoway, Lewis and beyond and is published weekly.  The Hebridean is a sister paper of the 'Gazette' and also provides local coverage.<ref>[http://www.jptalk.co.uk/termsandconditions.aspx Johnston Press - Publishers]</ref> Some community organisations in the rural districts have their own publications with news and features for these particular areas, such as the Rudhach for the Point district.<ref>[http://www.rudhach.com/ Rudhach - Community Newspaper]</ref><ref>[http://www.breasclete.com/Community_Newsletter.html - Breasclete Community Newspaper]</ref>

=== Sport ===
[[Image:lewisshinty.PNG|thumb|right|Badge of [[Lewis Camanachd]]]]There is a good provision of sporting grounds and sports centres in Lewis. Sports such as [[Football (soccer)|Football]], [[Rugby union]] and [[Golf]] are popular.

* Football is the most popular amateur sport in Lewis with Goathill Park in Stornoway hosting special matches involving select teams and visiting clubs and other organisations. Local teams currently participate in the [[Lewis and Harris Football League]] .

* [[Shinty]] is not as popular as in the rest of the West of Scotland, but the [[Lewis Camanachd]] team is based around the town.

* Attached to the [[Nicolson Institute]] School is the Ionad Spors Le<U+00F2>dhas (Lewis Sports Centre), an all-weather pitch and running track.

* The Lews Castle Grounds is the home of Stornoway [[Golf]] Club (the only 18-hole golf course in the Outer Hebrides).

* [[Angling]] is a very popular pass-time in Lewis as there are several good lochs and rivers for fishing.

* [[Hunting]] is possible in certain parts of the island. {{Fact|date=June 2007}}

* As Lewis is an island, various water sports, such as [[surfing]] are popular activities.

* Lewis has a terrain very suited to [[hillwalking]], particularly in Uig and near the ''border'' with [[Harris]].

=== Myths and legends ===
{{main|Hebridean Myths and Legends}}
The Isle of Lewis has a rich folklore, including:

* ''The Blue Men of the [[Minch]]'' (also known as storm kelpies), who occupy the stretch of water between Lewis and mainland Scotland, looking for sailors to drown and stricken boats to sink.
* ''[[Kelpie]]s'' were said to occupy several lochs, including one at Leurbost.
* [[Image:Teampull Mholuaidh.jpg|thumb|right|[[Teampull Mholuaidh]], 13th century temple in the village of Eoropie]]''[[Seonaidh]]'' - a water-spirit who had to be offered [[ale]] in the area of [[Teampull Mholuaidh]] in Ness.
* ''Searrach Uisge'' - a [[lake monster|monster]] who was said to occupy Loch Suainbhal. Resembling a capsized boat, this creature has been reported swimming around for one and a half centuries. Locals say lambs were once offered annually to the creature.<ref name = "http://www.paranormaldatabase.com/islands/outedata.php">[http://www.paranormaldatabase.com/islands/outedata.php  Paranormal Database, Outer Hebrides Pages]</ref> Other such creatures have been reported in several other lochs, including Loch Urubhal.
* A family of ''[[werewolf|werewolves]]'' were said to occupy an island on Loch Langavat.  Although long deceased, they promised to rise if their graves were disturbed.
* Various ''[[sea monster]]s'' have been reported off the shores of Lewis over the years, including a sighting reported in 1882 by a German ship off the [[Butt of Lewis]]. The ship, 15 kilometres off the coast, reported a sea serpent around 40 metres in length, several bumps protruding from the water, along its back. Sea serpents have also been reported at the southern side of the island.<ref name = "http://www.paranormaldatabase.com/islands/outedata.php">[http://www.paranormaldatabase.com/islands/outedata.php  Paranormal Database, Outer Hebrides Pages]</ref>
* [[orb (paranormal)|Glowing Balls]] have been reported in the area of Sandwick. The lights that float around the area normally announce approaching death for a local. Some say the light belongs to an Irish merchant who was robbed and murdered on the island.<ref name = "http://www.paranormaldatabase.com/islands/outedata.php">[http://www.paranormaldatabase.com/islands/outedata.php  Paranormal Database, Outer Hebrides Pages]</ref>

=== Gastronomy ===

* Each year, men from [[Ness, Western Isles|Ness]] go out to the island of [[Sula Sgeir]] in late August for two weeks to harvest young [[gannets]] known locally as Guga, which are a local delicacy.

* Lewis has many hotels and restaurants serving varied menus from the more remote locations to the centre of Stornoway. In the town, there are Chinese, Thai and Indian restaurants as well as numerous establishments with authentic Scottish menus. Chefs use local produce as much as possible, and the crofting and fishing industry on the islands ensures they have a wide range of high quality ingredients from which to choose. Naturally, fresh seafood is featured heavily with the catch landed that morning, often put straight into the pot.
