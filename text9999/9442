==Biography==

He was born in Biysk of [[Jewish]] parents, and lived in [[Moscow]] from early childhood. 

===A Samizdat Writer===

<blockquote>"Genrikh Sapgir is the most prominent figure of the writers that came to be associated with the now well-known Lianosovo group, which also included [[Vsevolod Nekrasov]] and [[Igor Kholin]]. These Moscow poets sought out new models and positions and exploited the possibilities of inserting common speech directly in their texts. Each of them had a Dostoyevskian eye for everyday Russian life, which made their work immediately accessible."<ref>Kudryavitsky, A. A Night in the Nabokov Hotel: 20 Contemporary Poets from Russia</ref> </blockquote>

From 1959 he published his poetry for children. His other poems appeared only in <U+00E9>migr<U+00E9> magazines, such as Continent and Strelets/The Archer.
