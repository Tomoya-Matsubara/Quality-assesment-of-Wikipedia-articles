Port Metro Vancouver is the new principal authority for shipping and [[port]]-related land and sea use in the [[Metro Vancouver]] region.

==History==
===Prior to Merger===
Prior to the formation of the new authority, there were three separate port authorities in the [[Metro Vancouver]] region: the [[Port of Vancouver]], which was the largest port in [[Canada]]; the [[Fraser River]] Port Authority, and the North Fraser Port Authority.

Although the ports were able to financially support themselves, the federal legislation governing the authorities generated some inefficiency, as the port authorities, legally being separate entities, were forced to compete with each other economically for business. This inefficiency came to the attention of the local media in 2006 when it was found that the recently-expanded Fraser Surrey Docks, operated by the Fraser River Port Authority in [[North Delta]], were sitting idle after their principal shipping partner, [[CP Ships]], decided to relocate to the facilities of the Port of Vancouver when they were already nearing capacity. <ref>[http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/story.html?id=243c5a27-053e-49c4-8bde-f94f9ffef45d&k=37589] Container docks in Surrey idle after $190m expansion - [[The Vancouver Sun]]</ref>

Some, however, had opposed the possible merger as they feel the new authority will not recognize the unique concerns of the [[Fraser River]]. John Cummins, the Richmond East - Delta [[Member of Parliament|MP]], has called the merger a "sellout" of the North Fraser River Authority to international shippers. <ref>[http://www.canada.com/deltaoptimist/news/story.html?id=2f60866e-8cf9-424a-b8d4-6566b240768c&k=81133] Port authorities set to amalgamate - Delta Optimist</ref>

To increase efficiency of the ports of [[Vancouver]], the federal [[Minister of Transport]] permitted the three authorities to do studies on the benefits of amalgamating the three separate authorities into one in June 2006. The resulting report highlighted several benefits of amalgamation, and in [[June 16]], [[Transport Canada]] granted a "certificate of intent to amalgamate port authorities". In December 21, 2007, the government of [[Canada]] published a certificate of amalgamation that allowed the three port authorities to merge into one effective January 1, 2008. <ref>[http://www.vfpa.ca/aboutus/aboutvfpa.aspx] About Us - Port Metro Vancouver</ref>

===Post-Merger===
Since the merger, the port authority has been embroiled in controversy in [[Mission, British Columbia|Mission]], [[British Columbia]] over plans to build a barge [[container port]] on an environmentally-sensitive [[wetland]]. The port authority has admitted that such plans have existed prior to the merger and that they have not consulted the community beforehand. Proponents argue that the new terminal will reduce emissions and truck traffic throughout the region and ease capacity problems, while critics feel that the truck traffic may move all the way to Mission and cause traffic and environmental problems there. Many residents are also concerned that the container terminal will be [[NIMBY|unsightly]]. <ref>[http://www.canada.com/abbotsfordtimes/news/story.html?id=7e0d6b4c-9eab-4ac5-9057-83f4c1f83992&k=36039] Mission port plan doesn't sail - [[Global Television Network|Global]]</ref>
