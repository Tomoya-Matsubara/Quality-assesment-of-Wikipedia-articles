'''Dimosthenis Valavanis''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: <U+0394><U+03B7><U+03BC><U+03BF><U+03C3><U+03B8><U+03AD><U+03BD><U+03B7><U+03C2> <U+0392><U+03B1><U+03BB><U+03B1><U+03B2><U+03AC><U+03BD><U+03B7><U+03C2> 1829-1854) was a Greek poet of the [[First Athenian School]].

He was born in 1829 in [[Karytaina]]. As a child he was orphaned and moved with relatives in [[Nauplio]] where he finished school. He enrolled in the faculty of Medicine in the [[University of Athens]]. Before graduating he contracted tuberculosis and died in [[1854]].

As he died very young he did not manage to publish a poetry collection. Some of his poems were published in literary magazines. He is one of the few poets of the First Athenian School that wrote poems both in [[Katharevousa]] and [[Demotic Greek]]. He also wrote a novel titled Two Nights which was published in ''Euterpi ''magazine and a tragedy (The death of [[Papaflessas]]) which is lost. Modern critics have found in his work the prospects of a creative force which was cut short because of his early death.
