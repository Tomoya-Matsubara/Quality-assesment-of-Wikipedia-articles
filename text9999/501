{{nihongo|'''J-Air Co., Ltd.'''|<U+682A><U+5F0F><U+4F1A><U+793E><U+30B8><U+30A7><U+30A4><U+30A8><U+30A2>|Kabushiki-gaisha Jei Ea}}, is a regional commuter airline based in [[Nishikasugai District, Aichi|Nishikasugai]], [[Aichi Prefecture|Aichi]], [[Japan]], with its [[headquarter]]s and [[airline hub|main hub]] at [[Nagoya Airfield]]. Its operations include scheduled [[passenger]] services to 16 destinations across regional [[Japan]], under [[Japan Airlines]]' flight numbers. The airline has a fleet 12 aircraft, consisting of [[Bombardier CRJ200|Bombardier CRJ-200]]s and [[Embraer E-Jets#E-170/175|Embraer 170]]s.

J-Air is a wholly owned [[subsidiary]] of Japan's [[flag carrier]], Japan Airlines (JAL) and an affiliate member of the [[Oneworld]] alliance. The airline was founded on August 8, 1996, when JAL restructured JAL Flight Academy and J-Air was separated; and began operations as a separate entity from [[Hiroshima-Nishi Airport]] on November 1. Faced with limited opportunities for route expansion at Hiromshima, the airline relocated to its new home at [[Nagoya Airfield]], after the opening of [[Ch<U+016B>bu Centrair International Airport]], on February 17, 2005. In the [[fiscal year]] ended March 31, 1999, J-Air, together with its sister airlines within the JAL Group, carried over 32 [[million]] passengers and over 1.1 million [[ton]]s of [[cargo]] and [[mail]].

== History ==
JAL Flight Academy (JFA) was established by [[Japan Airlines]] (JAL) in August 1989, as a flight training school [[subsidiary]] based at Omura Airport, [[Nagasaki Prefecture|Nagasaki]]. It provided conversion training for its [[flight engineer]]s to become [[aviator|pilot]]s. In April 1991, a new division of JFA was created to operate scheduled services to succeed the troubled ''Nishi Seto Airlink'' services, a commuter airline serving cities in western [[Japan]]. Since the introduction of the 19-seats [[Handley Page Jetstream#British Aerospace Jetstream 31|Jetstream 31]]s (JS31) in September 1991, the aircraft progressively replaced the [[Embraer EMB 110 Bandeirante]] inherited from ''Nishi Seto''.<ref name=hist>{{cite press release|title=JAL Subsidiary Airlines|url=http://www.jal.com/en/press/2000/012001/012001.html|publisher=[[Japan Airlines]]|date=2000-01-20|accessdate=2009-09-09}}</ref><ref name=ayumi>{{cite web|title=<U+30B8><U+30A7><U+30A4><U+30FB><U+30A8><U+30A2><U+306E><U+3042><U+3086><U+307F>|trans_title=J-Air's Progress|url=http://www.jair.co.jp/about/ayumi.html|language=Japanese|publisher=J-Air|accessdate=2009-09-09}}</ref><ref name=FI040323>{{cite news|title=J-Air|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/2004/2004-09%20-%200211.html|format=PDF|page=89|work=[[Flight International]]|publisher=[[Reed Business Information]]|date=2004-03-23|accessdate=2009-09-12}}</ref>

In August 1996, JAL Flight Academy was restructured, J-Air was separated and established as a wholly owned regional subsidiary [[airline]] of Japan Airlines on August 8. On November 1, the airline inaugurated its first flight from [[Hiroshima-Nishi Airport]] and was building up service on smaller-demand domestic routes, which larger aircraft could not serve economically. However, the [[local government]] [[subsidy]] was terminated at the end of the 2000 [[fiscal year]] and the airline was required to become self-sufficient. As part of its domestic [[marketing strategy]], JAL found a [[niche market]] where the 100-plus-seats [[Boeing 737]]s were too large and frequent services were in demand, and began repositioning the airline. Fifty-seats [[Bombardier CRJ200|Bombardier CRJ-200]]s were introduced and progressively replaced the five JS31s until completion in August 2003.<ref name=hist/><ref name=ayumi/><ref>{{cite news|title=Other News|url=http://www.atwonline.com/news/archive/index.html?issue=jan0305|work=ATW Daily News|publisher=[[Penton Media]]|date=2005-01-07|accessdate=2009-09-12}}</ref>

Despite the introduction of the Bombardier CRJ-200s, there were limited opportunities for route expansion from its home at Hiroshima-Nishi Airport. The airline decided to move to [[Nagoya Airfield]], after the opening of [[Ch<U+016B>bu Centrair International Airport]]. On February 17, 2005, J-Air realized its dream and relocated to its new home at Nagoya Airfield. In order to strengthen the recognition of the JAL brand and improve customer convenience, the airline disposed its own flight numbers and changed to JAL flight numbers from April 1, 2005.<ref name=ayumi/><ref>{{cite press release|title=JAL Group Subsidiary J Air Flight Numbers to Change to JAL|url=http://www.jal.com/en/press/2004/122701/122701.html|publisher=[[Japan Airlines]]|date=2004-12-27|accessdate=2009-09-10}}</ref> 

On April 1, 2007, J-Air, together with four of its sister airlines within the JAL Group, joined [[Oneworld]] and became a Oneworld affiliate member.<ref>{{cite news|title=Japan Airlines|url=http://www.atwonline.com/news/story.html?storyID=8442|work=ATW Daily News|publisher=[[Penton Media]]|date=2007-04-03|accessdate=2009-09-12}}</ref> On June 18, JAL signed a purchase agreement with [[Embraer]] for ten [[Embraer E-Jets#E-170/175|Embraer 170]] jets, with options to acquire another five aircraft. The contract value was worth approximately [[US$]]435 [[million]], if all the options are exercised.
