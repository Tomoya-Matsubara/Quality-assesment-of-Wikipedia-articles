'''Dravidian people''' refers to populations who speak languages belonging to the [[Dravidian languages |Dravidian language family]].  Populations of speakers are found mostly in [[South India |Southern India]] and some minor populations are found in [[Brahui language|Brahui]]-speaking parts of Pakistan, [[Kurukh language|Kurukh]]-speaking parts of Bangladesh, and [[Tamil language|Tamil]]-speaking parts of Sri Lanka.

==Concept of the Dravidian people==
The term Dravidian is taken from the [[Sanskrit]] term [[Dravida]]. It was adopted following the publication of [[Robert Caldwell]]'s ''Comparative grammar of the Dravidian or South-Indian family of languages'' (1856); a publication which established the language grouping as one of the major language groups of the world.

However over seventy three languages are presently listed as Dravidian in the [http://www.ethnologue.com/show_family.asp?subid=90422 study]. Further the languages are spread out and cover parts of India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka as is indicated in the [http://www.nvtc.gov/lotw/months/april/DravidianLanguageFamily.htm study]. 

The identification of the Dravidian people as a separate race arose from the realization by 19th-century Western scholars that there existed a group of languages spoken by people in the south of India, which very different to the [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]] languages prevalent in the north of the country. Because of this, it was said by Western researchers in India that the generally darker-skinned Dravidian speakers constituted a genetically distinct [[race]] even though they posess Caucasiod skull-structure. perhaops to enforce the British [[Divide and rule|"divide and conquer"]], Dravidians were envisaged as early inhabitants of India who had been partially displaced and assimilated by [[Aryan]] language speaking populations.

The vedic legends speak of battle between Asuras and Devas. It is generally assumed that this was a reflection of actual battle for supermacy that took place when Aryans started entering the Indian sub-continent. However the Asuras are actually the Iranians and the Devas are the Indo-Aryans. The Dasarajna war has been completly misunderstood as some racial violence from Aryans to non-Aryans. It was the Indo-Aryans who declared that they are the true Aryans while the Iranians were not. This battles eventually ended with Aryans, led by King [[Sudas]] ( a Sudra king) establishing supermacy all over India and the Iranians moving onto what today is the [[Greater Iran|Iranian Subcontinent]].

Historical evidence does not point to the fact that Dravidians were the race who had created the Indus Valley Civilisation. It remained unanswered why there were Aryan symbols that appear on the Indus Valley seals (e.g. [[swastika]].) However, even thoug the Aryan langauges are said to belong to the Indo-European family and not of the [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian family]], the root words are almost all the same. For example, 'land' is des, 'language' is basa and 'bread' is chapaati.

===Racial classifications===
{{main|Racial groups in India (historical definitions)}}

Carleton S. Coon (Ph.D Harvad University), in his book he published in 1969, "The Living Races of Man," he said, "''India is the easternmost outpost of the Caucasian racial region.''"  

However Richard McCulloch (who advocated [[Racial separatism]]) said that only the people of Central India belong to the Dravidic race while the South Indains are Veddoid. <ref>[http://www.racialcompact.com/racesofhumanity.html] </ref> SO here the term Dravidian becomes used for the Central Indians and not the South Indians.

In 440 BCE, [[Herodotus]] considered Dravidians to be a type of [[Ethiopian]] called the "''Eastern Ethiopian''" in contrast with the standard Ethiopian which he called a "''Western Ethiopian''".<ref>Jackson, John G. <u>Ethiopia and the Origin of Civilization.</u> 1939. September 25, 2007.[http://www.nbufront.org/html/MastersMuseums/JGJackson/EthiopiaOriginOfCivilization.html]</ref> In Herodotus' work <u>The History of Herodotus</u> he said, "''The eastern Ethiopians... They differed in nothing from the other Ethiopians, save in their language, and the character of their hair.''"<ref>Rawlison, George. Fordham University.  <u>The History of Herodotus</u>. 440 BCE [http://www.fordham.edu/HALSALL/ANCIENT/herodotus-history.txt]</ref>

In 1937, [[Bertram Thomas]], a scientist who practiced craniofacial anthropometry,<ref>Explore Saudi Arabia. "Bertram Thomas 1892-1950." September 26, 2007. [http://www.exploresaudiarabia.com/adventure/pdfs/explorer_thomas.pdf]</ref> claimed that Dravidians are descended from a protonegroid belt that spanned from Africa, the Arabian peninsula and South India.<ref name=Bertram />  Later, through the evolutionary process, this protonegroid belt gave rise to the "''Hamitic race''" in Africa, an intermediate people in the Arabian peninsula and Dravidians in India.<ref name=Bertram>Thomas, Bertram.  <u>The Arabs.</u>  Garden City: Doubleday, 1937.</ref>

In 1972, [[W. E. B. Du Bois]], a sociologist and historian, explained the Dravidians as, "''...pre-Dravidians, a taller larger type of Negro; then the Dravidians, Negroes with some mixture of Mongoloid and later Caucasoid stocks.''"<ref>W.E. Burghardt DuBois, <u>The World and Africa</u> (International Publishers, New York, 1972), p. 176</ref>

In 1985, Wayne B. Chandler, anthropologist and historian, explained that orignally there were two constituents of the "''Black race''" in India which populated the whole region: the "''Ethiopian Negrito''" and the "''Proto-Australoid''".<ref name=Rashidi />   The Ethiopian Negrito was the first migratory group that once inhabited all of India,<ref name=Rashidi />  Second, the Proto-Australoid migrated into India and mixed with the Negritos.<ref name=Rashidi /> Later, there was "''a mix of Black [Negritos and Proto-Australoids] and Mongoloid races, which occur[ed] in  Kannada, Tamil and Malayan regions''".  After this an invading party of multiracials who were a "''mix of Black and Caucasian races''" mixed with the previous Mongoloid and Negroid multiracials.  The combination of these mixes "''formed the Dravidians''".<ref name=Rashidi>Rashidi, Runoko <u>African Prescence in Early Asia.</u> Journal of African Civilizations: USA, 2007. ISBN 0-88738-717-9 p.87</ref>

In 1999, Professor Uthaya Naidu, an Indian historian<ref>Matlock, Gene D. <u>When India Ruled the World From Khyber (Kheeber) Pass to Gran Quivira (Kheevira), Nm and Baboquivari.</u> iUniverse:USA, 2002. ISBN  0-59521-746-X p. 170</ref>, classified the "''Sudroid race''" as including Dravidians, [[Munda people|Kolarians]], [[Dalit]]s and [[Adivasi]]s.<ref name=Naidu>Naidu, Uthaya.  <u>The Bible of Aryan Invasions.</u> Sudrastan Books, Jaipur:1999. </ref>  He described Sudroids, specifically Dravidians, as "''Negroid''" and "''black''".<ref name=Naidu />

In 2003, [[Kethesh Loganathan]], a sociologist specializing in developing countries<ref>Sinthanai. "Address of Devanesan Nesiah." 2007. September 26, 2007. [http://sinthanai.org/aug_nesaiha.html]</ref>, stated that the "''black Dravidian sub-race is the same as the black East African sub-race''".<ref>Loganathan, Kethesh. "Dravidians and Africans." September 25, 2007. 2003. [http://arutkural.tripod.com/tolcampus/drav-african.htm]</ref>

According to a prominent Hindu website, most Dravidians or South Indians are physically not very different from the [[Indo-Aryans]] of North India. Both the Aryans and the Dravidians belong to the [[Mediterranean race|Mediterranean]] sub-branch of the [[Caucasoid race]].<ref> Both the Aryans and Dravidians are related branches of the Caucasoid race generally placed in the same Mediterranean sub-branch.

{{main|Indian genetic studies}}
The [[genetic views on race]] differ in their classification of Dravidians. Most modern anthropologists, however, reject the genetic existence of race,<ref>Bindon, Jim. University of Alabama.  Department of Anthropology.

This doubtfulness applies to both paternal and maternal descent; however, it does not preclude the possibility of distinctive South Indian ancestries associated with Dravidian languages.<ref>Sitalaximi, T "Microsatellite Diversity among Three Endogamous Tamil Populations Suggests Their Origin from a Separate Dravidian Genetic Pool"

===Linguistic classifications===
{{main|Dravidian languages}}
The best known Dravidian languages are: [[Tamil language|Tamil]] (<U+0BA4><U+0BAE><U+0BBF><U+0BB4><U+0BCD>),[[Kannada language|Kannada]] (<U+0C95><U+0CA8><U+0CCD><U+0CA8><U+0CA1>), [[Malayalam language|Malayalam]] (<U+0D2E><U+0D32><U+0D2F><U+0D3E><U+0D33><U+0D02>),  [[Telugu language|Telugu]] (<U+0C24><U+0C46><U+0C32><U+0C41><U+0C17><U+0C41>), and [[Tulu language|Tulu]] (<U+0CA4><U+0CC1><U+0CB3><U+0CC1>). Notably one Dravidian language, [[Brahui language|Brahui]] (<U+0628><U+0631><U+0648><U+06C1><U+06CC>), is spoken in Pakistan and minor [[Tribe|tribal]] languages are used in Nepal and Bangladesh, perhaps hinting at the language family's wider distribution prior to the spread of the [[Indo-Aryan languages]], though relatively recent migrations of populations have also been proposed.

====Early arrival theory====
[[Image:Dravidische Sprachen.png|thumb|right|250px|Dravidian populated areas in South Asia]]
[[Kamil V. Zvelebil]] has suggested that the [[proto-Dravidian]]s of the [[Indian subcontinent]] arrived from the [[Middle East]], and may have been related to the [[Elamites]],<ref>Zvelebil, Kamil V. 1974. "Dravidian and Elamite - A Real Break-Through?", Journal of the American Oriental Society 94.3 (July-Sept.): 384-5.</ref> whose language some propose be categorized along with the Dravidian languages as part of a larger [[Elamo-Dravidian]] language family. However, [[S.A. Starostin]] has disputed the existence of an [[Elamo-Dravidian]] language family. 

According to a view put forward by [[geneticist]] [[Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza]] in the book  ''The History and Geography of Human Genes'', the Dravidians were preceded in the subcontinent by an [[Austro-Asiatic]] people, and followed by [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]]-speaking [[migrant]]s sometime later. The original inhabitants may be identified with the speakers of the [[Munda languages]], which are unrelated to either Indo-Aryan or Dravidian languages. However, the Munda languages, as a subgroup of the larger [[Austro-Asiatic languages|Austro-Asiatic language family]], are known to have arrived in the Indian subcontinent from the east, possibly from the area that is now southwestern [[China]], so any genetic similarity between the present-day speakers of the Munda languages and the "original inhabitants" of India is likely to be due to assimilation of the natives by Southeast Asian immigrants speaking a proto-Munda language.

Some linguists believe that Dravidian-speaking people were spread throughout the [[Indian subcontinent]] before the [[Aryan race|Aryans]] settled there. In this view the early [[Indus Valley civilization]] ([[Harappa]] and [[Mohenjo Daro]]) is often identified as having been Dravidian[http://www.harappa.com/arrow/stone_celt_indus_signs.html]. 
According to them it is now considered likely that the collapse of Indus Valley civilization was caused by environmental change (drought) which then encouraged the migration of the nomadic Indo-Aryans into the area. In that perspective it is therefore more likely that the Dravidian speakers of South India were already living in the region and were merely one of the groups little affected by the initial [[Indo-Aryan migration]]{{Fact|date=February 2007}}{{or}}.

====Late arrival theory====
Some scholars like J. Bloch and [[Michael Witzel|M. Witzel]] believe that the Dravidians moved into an already  Indo-Aryan speaking area after the oldest parts of the [[Rig Veda]] were already composed (see Bryant 2001: chapter 5)  

This theory might be supported if a higher antiquity of the Indo-Aryan languages could be established. However, since this theory is mainly a linguistic hypothesis, the Dravidian influence on Aryan languages must not necessarily be equated to a movement of populations.

===Prominent Dravidian linguistic subgroups===
There are three subgroups within the Dravidian linguistic family: North Dravidian, Central Dravidian and South Dravidian matching for the most part the  corresponding regions in the Indian subcontinent.

* ''[[Brahui]]'' : Brahuis belong to North-Dravidian subgroup. They are found in [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]] province of [[Pakistan]]. 
* ''[[Gonds]]'': A prominent group of Dravidian speaking [[Tribe|Tribal]] people the Central region of India.
* ''[[Kannadiga]]'' : These people belong to South-Dravidian subgroup. Mostly found in  [[Karnataka]] , [[Tamil nadu]] and [[Maharashtra]].
* ''[[Kurukh]]'' : These people belong to North-Dravidian subgroup. Found in India and Bangladesh. It is the only language indigenous in Bangladesh.
* ''[[Malayali]]'' : The people of [[Kerala]] belong to South-Dravidian linguistic subgroup. 
* ''[[Tamil people|Tamil]]'' : These people belong to South-Dravidian linguistic subgroup. Mostly found in [[Tamil Nadu]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Singapore]] and [[Malaysia]]. 
* ''[[Telugu people|Telugu]]'' : These people belong to South Dravidian subgroup (formerly classified with the Central Dravidian but now more specifically in the South Dravidian II or South Central Dravidian inner branch of the South Dravidian (Krishnamurti 2003:p19)). Mostly found in  Andhra Pradesh also in [[Orissa]] and [[Tamil Nadu]].

====Geographic distribution====

==Political ramifications==
The concept of a Dravidian race has affected thinking in India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh about racial and regional differences. 

===India===
{{Main|Aryan Invasion Theory (history and controversies)|Dravidian movement}}
Some Indians believe that the [[British Raj]] exaggerated differences between northern and southern Indians beyond [[linguistics|linguistic]] differences to help sustain their control of India. The British Raj ended in 1947, yet all discussion of [[Aryan race|Aryan]] or Dravidian "[[race]]s" remains highly controversial in India. It is now widely believed that the British only used this as their '[[Divide and rule]]' blueprint for taking over the region.<ref>{{cite book |last=Nelson |first=Robin |authorlink=Robin Nelson |title=Antinomies of Modernity: Essays on Race, Orient, Nation |date=2003 |publisher=Duke University Press |language=English |isbn=0822330466 |pages=37-38}}</ref>The British also used this "theory" of perceived differences between so-called "Aryans" and "Dravidians" to propagate racist beliefs concerning the inherent "inferiority" of the Dravidians when compared to the "Aryans", thus justifying their colonization of South Asia (since the British identified themselves as "Aryans")<ref>{{cite book |last=van der Veer |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter van der Veer |title=Conversion to modernities: The Globalization of Christianity |publisher=Routledge (UK) |language=English |isbn=0415912733 |pages=130}}</ref>

It has also informed aspects of radical politics (e.g. [[Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]], [[DK]], [[AIADMK]], VC, etc.) in the Indian state of  [[Tamil Nadu]] [[Tamil nationalism|nationalistic]] politics, which has at times appropriated the claim that Dravidians are the earliest inhabitants of India in order to argue that other populations such as the locally or [[ritually]] dominant  were oppressive interlopers from which the Dravidians should liberate themselves.

===Sri Lanka===
In Sri Lanka, the current [[Ethnic problem in Sri Lanka|ethnic conflict]] and the civil war are further complicated by the view that the majority [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]] and minority [[Sri Lankan Tamils|Tamils]] belong to two different ethnic and linguistic families.  [[Sinhalese language|Sinhalese]] (like [[Dhivehi]]) is an Indo-Aryan language that exists in the southern part of [[South Asia]].
