Meyers next worked for [[Chrysler Corporation]]. During the eight years with the automaker, he became Director of Manufacturing for the company's overseas plants in 1961 and lived in [[Geneva, Switzerland]] for three years.

==American Motors==
In 1962 Meyers was appointed Director of Purchasing for [[American Motors Corporation]] in [[Detroit]]. He was promoted to Director of Manufacturing, Vice-President of Manufacturing, Vice-President of the Product (Engineering) Group, and Executive Vice-President. In charge of product development, Meyers introduced AMC's innovative "AMC Buyer Protection Plan" that included the industry's first 12-month or {{convert|12000|mi|km|adj=on}} bumper-to-bumper [[warranty]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Boone |first=Louis E. |last2=Kurtz | first2=David L. |title=Contemporary Business |publisher=Dryden Press |year=1976 |pages=223<U+2013>224 |isbn=978-0-03-013651-1 }}</ref> The number of models was reduced to remove basic, stripped versions, but the centerpiece was improved quality during the production, although Meyers said "I don't claim we've magically and finally licked all the problems of the assembly line."<ref name="gets-it">{{cite journal|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=UtgDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA116&dq=Gerald+Meyers+AMC |first=Robert |last=Lund |title=AMC Gets It All Together |journal=Popular Mechanics |volume=136 |issue=4 |month=October |year=1971 |pages=116-118, 206 |accessdate=21 June 2013 }}</ref> Other improvements included mechanical upgrades to increase durability and quality, as well as improved standard equipment levels.<ref name="gets-it"/> By 1973, Meyers was pushing the development of the [[Wankel engine]] for installation into an AMC car within two years, possibility of going independent of GM's rotary engineering work, but he ruled out AMC producing the new engine itself.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=otQDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA34&dq=Gerald+Meyers+AMC |title=Detroit Listening Post: Update on AMC's Wankel |first=Robert |last=Lund |journal=Popular Mechanics |page=34 |month=August |year=1973 |volume=140 |issue=2 |accessdate=21 June 2013 }}</ref> While Meyers was AMC's top product man, he was "given considerable, and justifiable, credit for pushing the AMX/3 project from inception through the design and prototype stages into testing."<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=8nlWAAAAMAAJ&q=Gerald+C.+Meyers+AMCs+top+product+man+at+the+time+is+given+considerable+and+justifiable+credit+for+pushing+the+AMX/3+project |title=American Motors AMX/3 |journal=Cars and Parts |volume=24 |year=1981 ||page=15 |publisher=Amos Press |accessdate=21 June 2013 }}</ref>

A major management transition at AMC stated on 24 May 1977, then Meyers was named president and Chief Operating Officer, succeeding the retiring William Luneburg.<ref name="foster">{{cite book|url= http://books.google.com/books?id=D05p17q4cSYC&pg=PA165&dq=Gerald+C.+Meyers+AMC |page=165 |title=The Story of Jeep |first=Patrick R. |last=Foster |publisher=KP Books |year=2004 |isbn= 978-0-87349-735-0 |accessdate=21 June 2013 }}</ref> Although, Meyers was the executive who had been against AMC's purchase of Jeep in 1970 (of which the press kept reminding him), he was now one of Jeep's biggest proponents.<ref name="foster"/> 

Upon the retirement of [[Roy D. Chapin Jr.]] on 21 October 1977, Meyers became Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.<ref>{{cite book|title=Ward's Automotive Yearbook |publisher=Ward's Reports |year=1979 |page=237 |volume=41 }}</ref> At the time, Meyers was 49 years old and became the youngest top executive in the automobile industry bringing a wealth of manufacturing experience.<ref name="hyde"/> "The company was looking for a lot more than a steady hand on the tiller <U+2014> it was looking for a savior" but Meyers disagreed and argued that the company could survive and remain a factor in the automobile industry by abandoning its policy of head-on competition and instead focusing on and revamping its four-wheel-drive vehicles, a market segment left untended by the large automakers, and by acquiring advanced technology.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=GaggAQAAMAAJ&q=AMC+The+company+was+looking+for+a+lot+more+than+a+steady+hand+on+the+tiller+<U+2014>+it+was+looking+for+a+savior |title=American Motors |journal=Financial World |volume=149 |issue=1 |page=128 |month=January |year=1980 |accessdate=21 June 2013 }}</ref> 

For fiscal 1977, AMC's profits more than doubled compared to the previous year to a record $83.9 million on sales of $3.1 billion.<ref name="charge">{{cite journal|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,948805,00.html |title=Business: AMC's Charge|date=19 November 1979 |journal=Time |volume=114 |page=66 |accessdate=21 June 2013 }}</ref> The smallest U.S. automaker saw its car sales increase 37%, while they dropped 21% for the industry as a whole..<ref name="charge"/> Meyers described AMC strategy as a "three-legged stool" of small cars, Jeeps, and steady government and military contracts.<ref name="charge"/> By 1979, the automaker's management team headed by Meyers, ... "sharply cut back its money-losing car operations ... The perennially ailing baby of the auto industry suddenly looks healthy, and its new management team has a clear design for the future."<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=HzI7AAAAMAAJ&q=Gerald+C.+Meyers+AMC&dq=Gerald+C.+Meyers+AMC |title=American Motors |page=66 |first=Charles G. |last=Burck |volume=100 |year=1979 |accessdate=21 June 2013 }}</ref>

In 1979, Meyers formed a partnership with the French state-owned [[Renault]], which bought 22.5 percent of AMC stock.<ref>{{cite book|url= http://books.google.com/books?id=iZJzb91qsE4C&pg=PA127&dq=Gerald+Meyers+AMC ||page=127 |title=The American auto factory |publisher=BMI Publishers |first=Byron |last=Olsen |first2=Joseph |last2=Cabadas |year=2002 |isbn=9780760310595 |accessdate=21 June 2013 }}</ref> However, the U.S. economy continued to decline through 1981, and AMC now held on to only two percent of the domestic market and lost about $300 million during the previous two years.<ref name="battling">{{cite journal|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,954995,00.html |title=Battling for Survival |date=1 February 1982 |journal=Time |accessdate=21 June 2013 }}</ref> Meyers had acknowledged that AMC had no hope of raising the $6 billion it needed to finance more competitive products, stating "It would take dough that just isn't in the cards for us," so the company staked its future on help from Renault, which included development of the [[Renault Alliance]] sub-compact for production in Kenosha, Wisconsin.<ref>{{cite journal|url= http://books.google.com/books?id=QU41AAAAMAAJ&q=Gerald+C.+Meyers+AMC&dq=Gerald+C.+Meyers+AMC |title=American Motors: a hard drive to build on the success of the Alliance |page=58 |journal=Business Week |year=1983 |accessdate=21 June 2013 }}</ref> In early 1982, AMC asked its 16,000 hourly workers for wage concessions that would save the automaker $150 million.<ref name="battling"/> 

At age 53, Meyers retired from the company in February 1982, by which time Renault controlled 46 percent of American Motors.<ref>{{cite journal|url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,954995,00.html |title=Battling for Survival |journal=Time |date=1 February 1982 |accessdate=21 June 2013 }}</ref> He was with the automaker 20 years and was noted for orchestrating "the complicated linkup between AMC and Renault starting in 1979."<ref name="BW-1982">{{cite journal|url= http://books.google.com/books?id=X44pAQAAIAAJ&q=Gerald+C.+Meyers,+53,+a+20-year+veteran+of+the+company+who+orchestrated+the+complicated+AMC's+linkup+between |journal=Business Week |title=American Motors |page=21 |year=1982 |accessdate=21 June 2013 }}</ref> Meyers was succeeded as chairman by former AMC President W.
