'''Ernest Miller Hemingway''' (July 21, 1899 <U+2013> July 2, 1961) was an American [[American literature|writer]] and [[journalist]]. His distinctive writing style<U+2014>known as the [[iceberg theory]]<U+2014>characterized by economy and [[understatement]], influenced 20th-century fiction, as did his apparent life of adventure and the public image he cultivated. He produced most of his work between the mid-1920s and the mid-1950s, and his career peaked in 1954 when he won the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]. Hemingway's fiction was successful because the characters he presented exhibited authenticity that reverberated with his audience. Many of his works are classics of [[American literature]]. He published seven novels, six short stories collections, and two non-fiction works during his lifetime; with a further three novels, four collections of short stories, and three non-fiction works published after his death. 

Hemingway was born and raised in Oak Park, Illinois. After leaving high school he worked for a few months as a reporter, before leaving for the [[Italian Campaign (World War I)|Italian front]] to become an [[Red Cross|ambulance driver]] during World War I, which became the basis for his novel ''[[A Farewell to Arms]]''. He was seriously wounded and returned home within the year. In 1922 Hemingway married [[Hadley Richardson]], the first of his four wives, and the couple moved to Paris, where he worked as a [[Correspondent|foreign correspondent]]. During his time there he met and was influenced by [[modernism|modernist]] writers and artists of the 1920s expatriate community known as the "[[Lost Generation]]". His first novel, ''[[The Sun Also Rises]]'', was written in 1924.

After divorcing Hadley Richardson in 1927 Hemingway married [[Pauline Pfeiffer]]; they divorced following Hemingway's return from covering the [[Spanish Civil War]], after which he wrote ''[[For Whom the Bell Tolls]]''. [[Martha Gellhorn]] became his third wife in 1940, but he left her for [[Mary Welsh Hemingway]] after World War II, during which he was present at [[Normandy Landings|D-Day]] and the [[liberation of Paris]].

Shortly after the publication of ''[[The Old Man and the Sea]]'' in 1952 Hemingway went on safari to Africa, where he was almost killed in a plane crash that left him in pain or ill-health for much of the rest of his life. Hemingway had permanent residences in [[Key West]], Florida, and [[Cuba]] during the 1930s and 40s, but in 1959 he moved from Cuba to [[Idaho]], where he committed suicide in the summer of 1961.

===Early life===
[[File:ErnestHemingwayBabyPicture.gif|thumb|right|Ernest Hemingway was the second child, and first son, born to his parents Clarence and Grace Hemingway.|alt= an infant dressed in light colored clothing propped on a chair faces the camera]]
Ernest Miller Hemingway was born on July 21, 1899 in [[Oak Park, Illinois]], a suburb of Chicago.<ref>{{Harvnb|Oliver|p=140}}</ref> His father Clarence Edmonds Hemingway was a physician, and his mother Grace Hall-Hemingway a musician. Both were well-educated and well-respected in the conservative community of Oak Park.<ref>{{Harvnb|Reynolds|2000|p=17}}</ref> When Clarence and Grace Hemingway married in 1896, they moved in with Grace's father, Ernest Hall,<ref>{{Harvnb|Oliver|p=134}}</ref> after whom they named their first son.<ref group=note>Hemingway had five siblings: Marcelline (1898); Ursula (1902); Madelaine (1904); Carol 19110; and Leicester (1915). See {{Harvnb|Reynolds|2000|pp=17<U+2013>18}}</ref> Hemingway claimed to dislike his name, which he "associated with the naive, even foolish hero of [[Oscar Wilde]]'s play ''[[The Importance of Being Earnest]]''".<ref name="Meyers p8">{{Harvnb|Meyers|1985| p=8}}</ref> The family's seven-bedroom home in a respectable neighborhood contained a music studio for Grace and a medical office for Clarence.<ref name = "Reynolds pp 17-18">{{Harvnb|Reynolds|2000|pp=17<U+2013>18}}</ref>

Hemingway's mother frequently performed in concerts around the village. As an adult Hemingway professed to hate his mother, although biographer Michael Reynolds points out that Hemingway mirrored her energy and enthusiasm.<ref name="Reynolds 2000 19">{{Harvnb|Reynolds|2000|p=19}}</ref> Her insistence that he learn the cello became a "source of conflict", but he admitted the music lessons were useful to his writing, as in the "[[Counterpoint|contrapunctal]] structure" of ''[[For Whom the Bell Tolls]]''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Meyers|1985| p=3}}</ref> The family owned a summer home called Windemere on [[Walloon Lake]], near [[Petoskey]], Michigan where Hemingway learned to hunt, fish and camp in the woods and lakes of Northern Michigan. His early experiences in nature instilled a passion for outdoor adventure, living in remote or isolated areas, as well as hunting and fishing.<ref name="Meyers p13">{{Harvnb|Meyers|1985| p=13}}</ref> 
[[File:Hemingway birthplace.jpg|thumb|left|The Hemingway family seven-bedroom home in Oak Park, Illinois. Hemingway lived here until he graduated from high school.|alt=gabled two-story house with corner turret and wrap-around porch under a clear sky]] 
Hemingway attended [[Oak Park and River Forest High School]] from 1913 until 1917. He took part in a number of sports<U+2014>boxing, track and field, water polo, and football<U+2014>and had good grades in English classes.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mellow|1992|p=21}}</ref> He and his sister Marcelline performed in the school orchestra for two years.<ref name="Reynolds 2000 19"/> Hemingway wrote for and edited the ''Trapeze'' and ''Tabula'' (the school's newspaper and yearbook), where he imitated the language of sportswriters and used the [[pen name]] Ring Lardner, Jr.<U+2014>a nod to [[Ring Lardner]] of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' whose byline was "Line O'Type".<ref name="Meyers p19">{{Harvnb|Meyers|1985| p=19}}</ref> Like [[Mark Twain]], [[Stephen Crane]], [[Theodore Dreiser]] and [[Sinclair Lewis]], Hemingway was a journalist before becoming a novelist; after leaving high school he went to work for ''[[The Kansas City Star]]'' as a cub reporter.<ref name="Meyers p23">{{Harvnb|Meyers|1985| p=23}}</ref>  Although he stayed there for only six months he relied on the ''Star'''s [[style guide]] as a foundation for his writing: "Use short sentences.

===World War I===

Early in 1918  Hemingway responded to a [[Red Cross]] recruitment effort and signed on to be an ambulance driver in Italy.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mellow|1992|pp=48<U+2013>49}}</ref> He left New York in May, and arrived in Paris as the city was under bombardment from German artillery.<ref name="Meyers p27">{{Harvnb|Meyers|1985| p=27}}</ref> By June he was stationed at the [[Italian Campaign (World War I)|Italian Front]], and the day he arrived in Milan he was sent to the scene of a munitions factory explosion where rescuers retrieved the shredded remains of female workers. He described the incident in his [[non-fiction]] book ''[[Death in the Afternoon]]'': "I remember that after we searched quite thoroughly for the complete dead we collected fragments".<ref>{{Harvnb|Mellow|1992|p=57}}</ref>  A few days later he was stationed at [[Fossalta di Piave]]. On July&nbsp;8 he was seriously wounded by mortar fire, having just returned from the canteen to deliver chocolate and cigarettes to the men at the front line.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mellow|1992|p=59<U+2013>60}}</ref> Despite his wounds, Hemingway carried an Italian soldier to safety, for which he received the [[Silver Medal of Military Valor|Italian Silver Medal of Bravery]].<ref name="Meyers pp30-31">{{Harvnb|Meyers|1985| pp=30<U+2013>31}}</ref> Still only eighteen, Hemingway said of the incident: "When you go to war as a boy you have a great illusion of immortality. Other people get killed; not you&nbsp;... Then when you are badly wounded the first time you lose that illusion and you know it can happen to you."<ref name = "Putnam">{{Harvnb|Putnam}}</ref> He sustained shrapnel wounds to both legs; underwent an operation at a distribution center; spent five days at a field hospital; and was transferred to the Red Cross hospital in Milan for recuperation.<ref name="Desnoyers p3">{{Harvnb|Desnoyers| p=3}}</ref> Hemingway spent six months in the hospital, where he met and fell in love with [[Agnes von Kurowsky]], a Red Cross nurse seven years his senior.<ref name="Meyers p37">{{Harvnb|Meyers|1985| p=37}}</ref> Agnes and Hemingway planned to marry, but she became engaged to an Italian officer in March&nbsp;1919, an incident that provided material for the short and bitter work "[[A Very Short Story]]".<ref>{{Harvnb|Scholes}}</ref> Biographer Jeffrey Meyers claims Hemingway was devastated by Agnes' rejection, and that he followed a pattern of abandoning a wife before she abandoned him in future relationships. During his six months in recuperation Hemingway met and formed a strong friendship with [[Eric Dorman-Smith|"Chink" Dorman-Smith]] that lasted for decades.<ref name="Meyers pp40-42">{{Harvnb|Meyers|1985| pp=40<U+2013>42}}</ref>

===Toronto and Chicago===
Hemingway returned home early in 1919 to a time of readjustment. At not yet 20 years old, the war had created in him a maturity at odds with living at home without a job and the need for recuperation.<ref name="Meyers pp45<U+2013>46">{{Harvnb|Meyers|1985| pp=45<U+2013>46}}</ref> Biographer Michael Reynolds explains Hemingway "could not really tell his parents what he thought when he saw his bloody knee. He could not say how scared he was in another country with surgeons who could not tell him in English if his leg was coming off or not."<ref>{{Harvnb|Reynolds|1998|p=21}}</ref> That summer he spent time in Michigan with high school friends, fishing and camping;<ref name = "Putnam"/> and in September he spent a week in the back-country. The trip became the inspiration for his short story "[[Big Two-Hearted River]]", in which the [[semi-autobiographical]] character [[Nick Adams (character)|Nick Adams]] takes to the country to find solitude after returning from war.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mellow|1992|p=101}}</ref> A family friend offered him a job in Toronto; having nothing else to do he accepted. Late that year he began as a freelancer, staff writer and foreign correspondent for the ''Toronto Star Weekly''.<ref name="Meyers pp51<U+2013>53"/> However he returned to Michigan the following June,<ref name="Meyers pp51<U+2013>53">{{Harvnb|Meyers|1985| pp=51<U+2013>53}}</ref> and then moved to Chicago in September&nbsp;1920 to live with friends,  while still filing stories for the ''Toronto Star''. 

In Chicago he worked as associate editor of the monthly journal ''[[Cooperative Commonwealth]]'', where he met [[Sherwood Anderson]].<ref name="Meyers pp56-59">{{Harvnb|Meyers|1985| pp=56<U+2013>58}}</ref> When St. Louis native Hadley Richardson came to Chicago to visit Hemingway's roommate's sister, Hemingway, who was infatuated, later claimed "I knew she was the girl I was going to marry". Hadley was red-haired, with a "nurturing instinct", and eight years older than Hemingway.<ref name="Kert pp83-90"/> Despite the difference in age, Hadley, who had an overprotective mother, seemed less mature than usual for a young woman her age.<ref name="Oliver p139">{{Harvnb|Oliver|p=139}}</ref> Bernice Kert, author of ''The Hemingway Women'', claims Hadley was "evocative" of Agnes, but that Hadley had a childishness that Agnes lacked. The two corresponded for a few months, and then decided to marry and travel to Europe.<ref name="Kert pp83-90">{{Harvnb|Kert|1983|pp=83<U+2013>90}}</ref> They wanted to visit Rome, but Sherwood Anderson convinced them to visit Paris instead.<ref name="Baker 1972 pp7">{{Harvnb|Baker|1972|p=7}}</ref> They were married on September&nbsp;3, 1921; two months later Hemingway was hired as foreign correspondent for the ''Toronto Star''; and the couple left for Paris. Of Hemingway's marriage to Hadley, Meyers claims: "With Hadley, Hemingway achieved everything he had hoped for with Agnes: the love of a beautiful woman, a comfortable income, a life in Europe."<ref name="Meyers pp60<U+2013>62">{{Harvnb|Meyers|1985| pp=60<U+2013>62}}</ref>

===Paris===

The first Hemingway biographer [[Carlos Baker]] believes while Anderson suggested Paris because "the monetary exchange rate" made it an inexpensive place to live, more importantly it was where "the most interesting people in the world" resided. There Hemingway would meet writers such as [[Gertrude Stein]], [[James Joyce]] and [[Ezra Pound]] who "could help a young writer up the rungs of a career".<ref name="Baker 1972 pp7"/> The Hemingway of the early Paris years was a "tall, handsome, muscular, broad-shouldered, brown-eyed, rosy-cheeked, square-jawed, soft-voiced young man."<ref name="Meyers pp70<U+2013>74"/> He and Hadley lived in a small walk-up at 74 Rue du Cardinal Lemoine in the [[Latin Quarter]], and he worked in a rented room in a nearby building.<ref name="Baker 1972 pp7"/> Anderson wrote letters of introduction to Gertrude Stein and other writers in Paris.<ref name="Meyers pp61-63">{{Harvnb|Meyers|1985| pp=61<U+2013>63}}</ref> Stein, who was the bastion of [[modernism]] in Paris,<ref>{{Harvnb|Mellow|1991|p=8}}</ref> became Hemingway's mentor for a period, introducing him to the expatriate artists and writers of the [[Montparnasse Quarter]]. She referred to artists as the "[[Lost Generation]]"<U+2014>a term Hemingway popularized with the publication of ''The Sun Also Rises''.<ref name="Mellow p308">{{Harvnb|Mellow|1992| p=308}}</ref> A regular at Stein's [[Salon (gathering)|salon]], Hemingway met influential painters such as [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Joan Miro]], and [[Juan Gris]].<ref name="Reynolds 2000 28">{{Harvnb|Reynolds|2000|p=28}}</ref> However, Hemingway eventually withdrew from Stein's influence and their relationship deteriorated into a literary quarrel that spanned decades.<ref name="Meyers pp77<U+2013>81">{{Harvnb|Meyers|1985| pp=77<U+2013>81}}</ref> The American poet Ezra Pound,  older than Hemingway by 14 years, had been living in Paris since 1907.

During his first 20 months in Paris, Hemingway filed 88 stories for the ''Toronto Star''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Reynolds|p=24}}</ref> He covered the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919<U+2013>1922)|Greco-Turkish War]], where he witnessed the burning of [[Smyrna]]; wrote travel pieces such as "Tuna Fishing in Spain" and "Trout Fishing All Across Europe: Spain Has the Best, Then Germany"; and an article dedicated to [[bullfighting]]<U+2014>"Pamplona in July; World's Series of Bull Fighting a Mad, Whirling Carnival".<ref name="Desnoyers p5">{{Harvnb|Desnoyers| p=5}}</ref> Hemingway was devastated on learning that Hadley had lost a suitcase filled with his manuscripts at the [[Paris-Gare de Lyon|Gare de Lyon]] as she was travelling to [[Geneva]] to meet him in December&nbsp;1922.<ref name="Meyers pp69<U+2013>70">{{Harvnb|Meyers|1985| pp=69<U+2013>70}}</ref> The following September, because Hadley was pregnant, the couple returned to Toronto, where their son [[Jack Hemingway|John Hadley Nicanor]] was born on October 10, 1923. During their absence Hemingway's first book, ''Three Stories and Ten Poems'', was published. Two of the stories it contained were all that remained of his work after the loss of the suitcase, and the third had been written the previous spring in Italy. Within months a second volume, ''in our time'' (without capitals), was published. The small volume included six vignettes and a dozen stories Hemingway had written the previous summer during his first visit to Spain where he discovered the thrill of the [[bullfighting|''corrida'']]. He missed Paris, considered Toronto boring, and wanted to return to the life of a writer, rather than live the life of a journalist.<ref name="Baker 1972 15<U+2013>18">{{Harvnb|Baker|1972|pp=15<U+2013>18}}</ref>

Hadley, Hemingway, and their son (nicknamed Bumby), returned to Paris in January&nbsp;1924 and moved into a new apartment on the Rue Notre Dame des Champs.<ref name="Baker 1972 15<U+2013>18"/>  Hemingway helped [[Ford Madox Ford]] edit the ''[[Transatlantic Review]]'' in which were published works by Pound, [[John Dos Passos]], and Gertrude Stein as well as some of Hemingway's own early stories such as "[[Indian Camp]]".<ref name="Meyers p126">{{Harvnb|Meyers|1985| p=126}}</ref> When ''[[In Our Time (book)|In Our Time]]'' (with capital letters) was published in 1925, the dust jacket had comments from Ford.<ref>{{Harvnb|Baker|1972|p=34}}</ref><ref name="Meyers p127">{{Harvnb|Meyers|1985| p=127}}</ref> "Indian Camp" received considerable praise; Ford saw it as an important early story by a young writer,<ref>{{Harvnb|Mellow| page= 236}}</ref> and critics in the United States claimed Hemingway reinvigorated the short story with his use of declarative sentences and his crisp style.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mellow| page= 314}}</ref> Six months earlier, Hemingway met [[F.

Since his first visit to see the bullfighting at the Festival of [[San Ferm<U+00ED>n]] in [[Pamplona]] in 1923, Hemingway was fascinated by the sport; he saw in it the brutality of war juxtaposed against a cruel beauty. In June&nbsp;1925, Hemingway and Hadley left Paris for their annual visit to Pamplona accompanied by a group of American and British expatriates.<ref name="Meyers pp117-119">{{Harvnb|Meyers|1985| pp=117<U+2013>119}}</ref> The trip inspired Hemingway's first novel, ''The Sun Also Rises'', which he began to write immediately after the fiesta, finishing in September.<ref name = "Baker pp 30-34"/> The novel presents the culture of bullfighting with the concept of ''afici<U+00F3>n'', an authentic way of life, whereas the Parisian [[bohemians]] are depicted as inauthentic.<ref name="M<U+00FC>ller 2010">{{Harvnb|M<U+00FC>ller|2010}}</ref> Hemingway decided to slow his pace and devoted six months to the novel's rewrite.<ref name = "Baker pp 30-34"/> The manuscript arrived in New York in April,<ref>{{Harvnb|Mellow|1992|p=328}}</ref> and he corrected the final proof in Paris in August&nbsp;1926.<ref name="Baker p44">{{Harvnb|Baker|1972| p=44}}</ref> [[Charles Scribner's Sons|Scribner's]] published the novel in October.<ref name="Meyers p189">{{Harvnb|Meyers|1985| p=189}}</ref> ''The Sun Also Rises'' epitomized the post-war expatriate generation,<ref name="Mellow p302">{{Harvnb|Mellow|1992| p=302}}</ref> received good reviews and is "recognized as Hemingway's greatest work".<ref name="Meyers p192">{{Harvnb|Meyers|1985| p=192}}</ref> However, Hemingway himself later wrote to his editor [[Max Perkins]] that the "point of the book" was not so much about a generation being lost, but that "the earth abideth forever"; he believed the characters in ''The Sun Also Rises'' may have been "battered" but were not lost.<ref name="Baker p82">{{Harvnb|Baker|1972| p=82}}</ref>

Hemingway's marriage to Hadley deteriorated as he was working on ''The Sun Also Rises''.<ref name="Baker p44"/>  In the spring of 1926, Hadley became aware of his affair with Pauline Pfeiffer,<ref name="Baker p43">{{Harvnb|Baker|1972| p=43}}</ref> although she endured Pauline's presence in Pamplona that July.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mellow|1992|p = 333}}</ref> On their return to Paris, Hadley and Hemingway decided to separate; and in November she formally requested a divorce.

Some time that spring Hemingway suffered a severe injury in their Paris bathroom, when he pulled a skylight down on his head thinking he was pulling on a toilet chain. This left him with a prominent forehead scar, subject of numerous legends, which he carried for the rest of his life. When Hemingway was asked about the scar he was reluctant to answer.<ref>{{Harvnb|Robinson, Daniel}}</ref> After his departure from Paris, Hemingway "never again lived in a big city".<ref name="Meyers p204">{{Harvnb|Meyers|1985| p=204}}</ref>

In the late spring Hemingway and Pauline travelled to Kansas City where their son [[Patrick Hemingway]] was born on June&nbsp;28, 1928.

Upon his return to Key West in December, Hemingway worked on the draft of ''A Farewell to Arms'' before leaving for France in January. The draft had been finished in August but he delayed the revision. The serialization in ''[[Scribner's Magazine]]'' was scheduled to begin in May, but by April Hemingway was still working on the ending, which he may have rewritten as many as seventeen times.

In 1933 Hemingway and Pauline went on safari to East Africa. The 10-week trip provided material for ''[[Green Hills of Africa]]'', as well as the short stories "[[The Snows of Kilimanjaro]]" and "[[The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber]]".<ref name="Desnoyers p9">{{Harvnb|Desnoyers| p=9}}</ref> They visited [[Mombasa]], [[Nairobi]], and [[Machakos]] in [[Kenya]], then on to [[Tanganyika]],  where they hunted in the [[Serengeti]], around [[Lake Manyara]] and west and southeast of the present-day [[Tarangire National Park]]. Hemingway contracted [[amoebic dysentery]] that caused a prolapsed intestine, and he was evacuated by plane to Nairobi, an experience reflected in "The Snows of Kilimanjaro". Their guide was the noted "white hunter" Philip Hope Percival, who had guided [[Theodore Roosevelt]] on his 1909 safari. On his return to Key West in early 1934 Hemingway began work on ''Green Hills of Africa'', published in 1935 to mixed reviews.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mellow|1992|pp =337<U+2013>340}}</ref>

In 1937 Hemingway agreed to report on the [[Spanish Civil War]] for the [[North American Newspaper Alliance]] (NANA).<ref name="Mellow p488">{{Harvnb|Mellow|1992| p=488}}</ref> In March he arrived in Spain with Dutch filmmaker [[Joris Ivens]].<ref name="Koch p87">{{Harvnb|Koch|2005| p=87}}</ref> Ivens, who was filming ''[[The Spanish Earth]]'', needed Hemingway as a screenwriter to replace John Dos Passos, who left the project when his friend [[Jos<U+00E9> Robles]] was arrested and later executed.<ref name="Meyers p311">{{Harvnb|Meyers|1985| p=311}}</ref> The incident changed Dos Passos' opinion of the leftist republicans, which created a rift between him and Hemingway, who spread a rumor that Dos Passos was a coward for leaving Spain.<ref name="Koch p164">{{Harvnb|Koch|2005| p=164}}</ref> 

Journalist and writer [[Martha Gellhorn]], whom Hemingway had met in Key West the previous Christmas (1936), joined him in Spain.

In the spring of 1939, Hemingway crossed to Cuba in his boat to live in the [[Hotel Ambos Mundos]] in Havana, writing short stories and beginning ''[[For Whom the Bell Tolls]]''. This was the separation phase of a slow and painful split from Pauline, which had begun when Hemingway met Martha.<ref name="Meyers p326">{{Harvnb|Meyers|1985| p=326}}</ref> Martha soon joined him in Cuba, and they almost immediately rented "[[Finca Vigia]]" ("Lookout Farm"), a 15-acre property 15 miles from Havana. Pauline and the children left Hemingway that summer, after the family was re-united during a visit to Wyoming. After Hemingway's divorce from Pauline was finalized, he and Martha were married November 20, 1940, in Cheyenne, Wyoming.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lynn|1987|479}}</ref>  As he had after his divorce from Hadley, he changed locations; moving his primary summer residence to [[Ketchum, Idaho]], just outside the newly built resort of [[Sun Valley, Idaho|Sun Valley]], and his winter residence to Cuba.<ref name="Meyers p342">{{Harvnb|Meyers|1985| p=342}}</ref> He was at work on ''For Whom the Bell Tolls'', which he began in March&nbsp;1939 and finished in July&nbsp;1940.

In January&nbsp;1941 Martha was sent to China on assignment for ''[[Collier's]]'' magazine, and Hemingway accompanied her.

During World War II, he was in Europe from June to December&nbsp;1944. At the [[Normandy Landings|D-Day]] landing, military officials who considered him "precious cargo", kept him to a landing craft. Late in July he attached himself to "the 22nd Regiment commanded by [[Charles T. Lanham|Col.

In 1947 Hemingway was awarded a [[Bronze Star]] for his bravery during World War&nbsp;II. He was recognized for his valor in having been "under fire in combat areas in order to obtain an accurate picture of conditions", with the commendation that "through his talent of expression, Mr. Hemingway enabled readers to obtain a vivid picture of the difficulties and triumphs of the front-line soldier and his organization in combat".<ref name ="Putnam"/>

When Hemingway initially arrived in England, he met ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine correspondent Mary Welsh in London, and was infatuated. Martha (who had been forced to cross the Atlantic in a ship filled with explosives because he refused to help her get a press pass on a plane) arrived in London to find Hemingway hospitalized with a [[concussion]] from a car accident.

Hemingway said he "was out of business as a writer" from 1942 to 1945.<ref name="Mellow p552">qtd in {{Harvnb|Mellow|1992| p=552}}</ref> In 1946 he married Mary, who had an [[ectopic pregnancy]] five months later. Hemingway and Mary had a series of accidents and health problems after the war: in a 1945 car accident he "smashed his knee" and sustained another "deep wound on his forehead"; Mary broke her right ankle and then her left ankle in successive skiing accidents. In 1947 his sons Patrick and Gregory were in a car accident, leaving Patrick with a head wound and severely ill.<ref name="Meyers pp420<U+2013>421">{{Harvnb|Meyers|1985| pp=420<U+2013>421}}</ref> He became depressed as his literary friends died: in 1939 [[Yeats]] and Ford Madox Ford; in 1940 Scott Fitzgerald; in 1941 Sherwood Anderson and James Joyce; in 1946 Gertrude Stein; and the following year in 1947, Max Perkins, Hemingway's long time editor and friend.<ref name="Mellow pp548<U+2013>550">{{Harvnb|Mellow|1992| pp=548<U+2013>550}}</ref> During this period he had severe headaches, high blood pressure, weight problems, and eventually diabetes<U+2014>much of which was the result of previous accidents and heavy drinking.<ref name="Desnoyers p12">{{Harvnb|Desnoyers| p=12}}</ref> Nonetheless, early in 1946 he began work on ''[[The Garden of Eden]]'', finishing 800 pages by June.<ref>{{Harvnb|Meyers|1985| p=436}}</ref><ref group=note>''The Garden of Eden'' was published posthumously in 1986.

In 1948 Hemingway and Mary travelled to Europe. In Italy he returned to the site of his World War&nbsp;I accident, and shortly afterwards began work on ''[[Across the River and Into the Trees]]'', which he continued through 1949; it was published in 1950 to bad reviews.<ref name="Meyers p453">{{Harvnb|Meyers|1985| p=440}}</ref> The next year he wrote the draft of ''Old Man and the Sea'' in eight weeks, considering it "the best I can write ever for all of my life".<ref name="Desnoyers p12"/> ''The Old Man and the Sea'' became a book-of-the month selection, made Hemingway an international celebrity, and won the Pulitzer Prize in May 1952, a month before he left for his second trip to Africa.<ref name = "Desnoyers p13">{{Harvnb|Desnoyers| p= 13}}</ref><ref name="Meyers p489">{{Harvnb|Meyers|1985| p=489}}</ref>

In Africa he was seriously injured in two successive plane crashes. Hemingway chartered a sightseeing flight of the [[Belgian Congo]] as a Christmas present to Mary. On their way to photograph [[Murchison Falls]] from the air, the plane struck an abandoned utility pole and "crash landed in heavy brush." Hemingway's injuries included a head wound serious enough to leak cerebral fluid, while Mary broke two ribs.<ref>{{Harvnb|Baker|1972|pp=331<U+2013>333}}</ref> The next day, attempting to reach medical care in [[Entebbe]], they boarded a second plane that exploded at take-off with Hemingway suffering burns and another concussion.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mellow|1992|p=586}}</ref> They eventually arrived in Entebbe to find reporters covering the story of Hemingway's "death".

In October&nbsp;1954 Hemingway received the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]. He modestly told the press that [[Carl Sandburg]], [[Isak Dinesen]] and [[Bernard Berenson]] deserved the prize,<ref>{{Harvnb|Lynn|1987|p=574}}</ref> but the prize money would be welcome.<ref name="Baker p338">{{Harvnb|Baker|1972| p=338}}</ref>  Mellow claims Hemingway "had coveted the Novel Prize", but when he won it, months after his plane accidents and the ensuing world-wide press coverage, "there must have been a lingering suspicion in Hemingway's mind that his obituary notices had played a part in the academy's decision."<ref name="Mellow pp588<U+2013>589">{{Harvnb|Mellow|1992| pp=588<U+2013>589}}</ref> Because he was suffering pain from the African accidents, he decided against travelling to [[Stockholm]].<ref name="Meyers p509">{{Harvnb|Meyers|1985| p=509}}</ref> Instead he sent a speech to be read, defining the writer's life: "Writing, at its best, is a lonely life. Organizations for writers palliate the writer's loneliness but I doubt if they improve his writing. He grows in public stature as he sheds his loneliness and often his work deteriorates.

From the end of the year in 1955 to early 1956, Hemingway was bedridden.<ref name="Meyers p512">{{Harvnb|Meyers|1985| p=512}}</ref> He was told to stop drinking to mitigate liver damage, advice he initially followed but then disregarded.<ref>{{Harnvb|Reynolds|2000|pp=291<U+2013>293}}</ref> In October&nbsp;1956 he returned to Europe and met [[Basque people|Basque]] writer [[Pio Baroja]], who was seriously ill and died weeks later.

Although Hemingway's mental deterioration was noticeable in the summer of 1960, he again travelled to Spain to obtain photographs for the manuscript.

==Writing style==
The ''New York Times'' wrote in 1926 of Hemingway's first novel: "No amount of analysis can convey the quality of ''The Sun Also Rises''. It is a truly gripping story, told in a lean, hard, athletic narrative prose that puts more literary English to shame".<ref>{{cite article |title=Marital Tragedy |date=October 31, 1926|url=http://www.nytimes.com/books/99/07/04/specials/hemingway-rises.htm |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=2010-01-15}}</ref> ''The Sun Also Rises'' is written in the spare, tightly written prose, for which Hemingway is famous; a style that has influenced countless crime and pulp fiction novels.<ref name="Nagel 1996 87">{{Harvnb|Nagel|1996|p=87}}</ref> In 1954, when Hemingway was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature, it was for "his mastery of the art of narrative, most recently demonstrated in ''The Old Man and the Sea'', and for the influence that he has exerted on contemporary style".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1954/index.html|title=The Nobel Prize in Literature 1954 |author= |date= |work= |publisher=The Nobel Foundation|accessdate=2010-03-07}}</ref>

[[Henry Louis Gates]] believes Hemingway's style was fundamentally shaped "in reaction to [his] experience of world war". After World War&nbsp;I, he and other modernists "lost faith in the central institutions of Western civilization", by reacting against the "elaborate style" of 19th century writers; and by creating a style "in which meaning is established through dialogue, through action, and silences<U+2014>a fiction in which nothing crucial<U+2014>or at least very little<U+2014>is stated explicitly."<ref name="Putnam"/>

|style="text-align: left;"|If a writer of prose knows enough of what he is writing about he may omit things that he knows and the reader, if the writer is writing truly enough, will have a feeling of those things as strongly as though the writer had stated them. The dignity of movement of an ice-berg is due to only one-eighth of it being above water. A writer who omits things because he does not know them only makes hollow places in his writing.

Because he began as a writer of short stories,  Baker believes Hemingway learned to "get the most from the least, how to prune language how to multiply intensities, and how to tell nothing but the truth in a way that allowed for telling more than the truth".<ref name ="Baker p117">{{Harvnb|Baker|1972|p= 117}}</ref> Hemingway referred to his style as the [[Iceberg Theory|iceberg theory]]: in his writing the facts float above water; the supporting structure and symbolism operate out-of-sight.<ref name ="Baker p117"/>  Writing in "The Art of the Short Story", he explains: "A few things I have found to be true. If you leave out important things or events that you know about, the story is strengthened. If you leave or skip something because you do not know it, the story will be worthless. The test of any story is how very good the stuff that you, not your editors, omit."<ref>{{Harvnb|Hemingway, The Art of the Short Story}}</ref>  

Jackson Benson believes Hemingway used autobiographical details as framing devices about life in general<U+2014>not only about his life. For example, Benson postulates that Hemingway used his experiences and drew them out with "what if" scenarios: "what if I were wounded in such a way that I could not sleep at night? What if I were wounded and made crazy, what would happen if I were sent back to the front?"<ref>{{Harvnb|Benson|1989}}</ref> The concept of the iceberg theory is sometimes referred to as the "theory of omission." Hemingway believed the writer could describe one thing (such as Nick Adams fishing in "The Big Two-Hearted River") though an entirely different thing occurs below the surface (Nick Adams concentrating on fishing to the extent that he does not have to think about anything else).<ref>{{Harvnb|Oliver|1999|pp=321<U+2013>322}}</ref>

The simplicity of the prose is deceptive. Zoe Trodd believes Hemingway crafted skeletal sentences in response to [[Henry James]]'s observation that World War&nbsp;I had "used up words". Hemingway offers a "multi-focal" photographic reality. His iceberg theory of omission is the foundation on which he builds. The syntax, which lacks [[grammatical conjunction|subordinating conjunctions]], creates static sentences. The photographic "[[Snapshot (photography)|snapshot]]" style creates a [[collage]] of images. Many types of internal punctuation (colons, semicolons, dashes, parentheses) are omitted in favor of short declarative sentences. The sentences build upon another, as events build to create a sense of the whole. Multiple strands exist in one story; an "embedded text" bridges to a different angle. He also uses other cinematic techniques of "cutting" quickly from one scene to the next; or of "splicing" a scene into another. Intentional omissions allow the reader to fill the gap, as though responding to instructions from the author, and create three-dimensional prose.<ref>{{Harvnb|Trodd}}</ref>

|style="text-align: left;"|In the late summer that year we lived in a house in a village that looked across the river and the plain to the mountains. In the bed of the river there were pebbles and boulders, dry and white in the sun, and the water was clear and swiftly moving and blue in the channels. Troops went by the house and down the road and the dust they raised powdered the trees.

|}  
In his literature, and in his personal writing, Hemingway habitually used the word "and" in place of commas. This use of [[polysyndeton]] may serve to convey immediacy.  Hemingway's polysyndetonic sentence<U+2014>or in later works his use of subordinate clauses<U+2014>uses conjunctions to juxtapose startling visions and images;  Jackson Benson compares them to [[haiku]]s.<ref name="McCormick p49">{{Harvnb|McCormick|p=49}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Benson|p=309}}</ref> Many of Hemingway's followers misinterpreted his lead and frowned upon all expression of emotion; [[Saul Bellow]] satirized this style as "Do you have emotions? Strangle them."<ref>qtd. in {{Harvnb|Hoberek|p=309}}</ref> However, Hemingway's intent was not to eliminate emotion, but to portray it more scientifically. Hemingway thought it would be easy, and pointless, to describe emotions; he sculpted collages of images in order to grasp "the real thing, the sequence of motion and fact which made the emotion and which would be as valid in a year or in ten years or, with luck and if you stated it purely enough, always".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://books.simonandschuster.com/Death-In-The-Afternoon/Ernest-Hemingway/9780684859224/excerpt_with_id/11296 |title=Death in the Afternoon:Chapter One Excerpt |last =Hemingway|first=Ernest |publisher=Simon & Schuster |accessdate=2009-12-08}}</ref> This use of an image as an [[objective correlative]] is characteristic of Ezra Pound, T. S. Eliot, James Joyce, and [[Proust]].<ref>{{Harvnb|McCormick|p=47}}</ref> Hemingway's letters refer to Proust's [[In Search of Lost Time|''Remembrance of Things Past'']] several times over the years, and indicate he read the book at least twice.<ref name="Burwell p187">{{Harvnb|Burwell|1996|p=187}}</ref> His writing was likely also influenced by the [[Japanese poetry|Japanese poetic canon]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Starrs|1998|p=77}}</ref><ref group = note>Starrs draws a correlation between the "[[Imagism|Imagist]]" influences of Ezra Pound, who mentored Hemingway in the 1920s.

==Themes==
Recurring themes in [[American literature]] exist with clarity in Hemingway's work.  [[Leslie Fiedler]] sees the theme he defines as "The Sacred Land"<U+2014>the [[American Old West|American West]]<U+2014>extended in Hemingway's work, to include mountains in Spain, Switzerland and Africa, and to the streams of Michigan. The American West is given a symbolic nod with the naming of the  "Hotel Montana" in ''The Sun Also Rises'' and ''For Whom the Bell Tolls''.<ref name="Fiedler"/> Although Hemingway writes about sports, Carlos Baker believes the emphasis is more on the athlete than the sport.<ref>{{Harvnb|Baker|p=101-121}}</ref> According to Stoltzfus and Fiedler, Hemingway's nature is a place for rebirth, for therapy, and the hunter or fisherman has a moment of transcendence when the prey is killed.<ref name="Harvnb|Stoltzfus"/> Nature is where men are without women: men fish; men hunt; men find redemption in nature.<ref name="Fiedler"/> 

Fiedler believes Hemingway has inverts the American literary theme of the evil "Dark Woman"  versus the good "Light Woman".  The dark woman<U+2014>[[Brett Ashley]] of ''The Sun Also Rises''<U+2014>is a goddess; the light woman<U+2014>Margot Macomber of "The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber"<U+2014>is a murderess.<ref name="Fiedler">{{Harvnb|Fiedler| p=345<U+2013>365}}</ref> Robert Sholes admits that early Hemingway stories, such as "A Very Short Story", present "a male character favorably and a female unfavorably."<ref>{{Harvnb|Sholes|1990|p= 42}}</ref> According to Rena Sanderson, early Hemingway critics lauded his male-centric world of masculine pursuits, and the fiction  divided women into "castrators or love-slaves." Feminist critics attacked Hemingway as "public enemy number one", although more recent re-evaluations of his work "have given new visibility to Hemingway's female characters (and their strengths) and have revealed his own sensitivity to gender issues, thus casting doubts on the old assumption that his writings were one-sidedly masculine."<ref>{{Harvnb|Sanderson|1996|p= 171}}</ref> Nina Baym believes that Brett Ashley and Margot Macomber "are the two outstanding examples of Hemingway's 'bitch women.'"<ref>{{Harvnb|Baym|1990}}</ref>

The theme of women and death is evident in stories as early as "Indian Camp".  The theme of death permeates Hemingway's work. Young believes the emphasis in "Indian Camp" was not so much on the woman who gives birth or the father who commits suicide, but on Nick Adams who witnesses these events as a child, and becomes a "badly scarred and nervous young man."  Hemingway sets the events in "Indian Camp" that shape the Adams persona. Young believes "Indian Camp" holds the "master key" to "what its author was up to for some thirty-five years of his writing career." <ref>{{Harvnb|Young|1964|p=6}}</ref> Stoltzfus considers Hemingway's work to be more complex with a representation of the truth inherent in [[existentialism]]: if "nothingness" is embraced, then redemption is achieved at the moment of death. Those who face death with dignity and courage live an authentic life. Francis Macomber dies happy because the last hours of his life are authentic; the [[bullfighter]] in the [[Bullfighting|corrida]] represents the pinnacle of a life lived with authenticity.<ref name="Harvnb|Stoltzfus">{{Harvnb|Stoltzfus}}</ref> In his paper ''The Uses of Authenticity: Hemingway and the Literary Field'',  Timo M<U+00FC>ller writes that Hemingway's fiction is successful because the characters live an "authentic life", and the "soldiers, fishers, boxers and backwoodsmen are among the archetypes of authenticity in modern literature".<ref name="M<U+00FC>ller 2010"/>

The theme of emasculation is prevalent in Hemingway's work, most notably in ''The Sun Also Rises''. Emasculation, according to Fiedler, is a result of a generation of wounded soldiers; and of a generation in which women such as Brett gained [[Women's suffrage|emancipation]].<ref name="Fiedler"/> Baker believes Hemingway's work emphasizes the "natural" versus the "unnatural". In "Alpine Idyll"  the "unnaturalness" of skiing in the high country late spring snow is juxtaposed against the "unnaturalness" of the peasant who allowed his wife's dead body to linger too long in the shed during the winter. The skiers and peasant retreat to the valley to the "natural" spring for redemption.<ref>{{Harvnb|Baker|pp=101<U+2013>121}}</ref>

Hemingway's work has been characterized as misogynistic and homophobic.  Susan Beegel analyzed four decades of Hemingway criticism, published in her essay "Critical Reception". She found, particularly in the 1980s, "critics interested in multiculturalism" simply ignored Hemingway; although some "apologetics" have been written.  Typical is this analysis of ''The Sun Also Rises'': "Hemingway never lets the reader forget that Cohn is a Jew, not an unattractive character who happens to be a Jew but a character who is unattractive because he is a Jew." During the same decade, according to Beegel, criticism was published that investigated the "horror of homosexuality", and racism in Hemingway's fiction.<ref>{{Harvnb|Beegel|1996}}</ref>

==Influence and legacy==
Hemingway's legacy to American literature is his style: writers who came after him emulated it or avoided it.<ref>{{Harvnb|Oliver|1999|pp=140<U+2013>141}}</ref> As early as the 1930s Hemingway's style was [[parody|parodied]], while critics pointed to it as "lazy" within the context of the "American literary tradition".<ref>{{Harvnb|Trogdon|1996}}</ref> After his reputation was sealed with the publication of ''The Sun Also Rises'', he became the spokesperson for the post-World War I generation, having established a style to follow.<ref name="Nagel 1996 87"/> His books were [[Nazi book burning|burned]] in Berlin in 1933, "as being a monument of modern decadence", and disavowed by his parents as "filth".<ref name="Harvnb|Hallengren">{{Harvnb|Hallengren}}</ref>  Reynolds asserts the legacy is that "he left stories and novels so starkly moving that some have become part of our cultural heritage."<ref>{{Harvnb|Reynolds|2000|p=15}}</ref> In a 2004 speech at the [[John F. Kennedy Library]], [[Russell Banks]] declared that he, like many male writers of his generation, was influenced by Hemingway's writing philosophy, style,  and public image.<ref>{{Harvnb|Banks|p=54}}</ref>
[[Image:Heming Way.jpg|thumb|Walkway named for Ernest Hemingway, [[Ronda]], Spain]]

Benson believes the details of Hemingway's life have become a "prime vehicle for exploitation", creating a "Hemingway industry".<ref>{{Harvnb|Benson|1989|p=347}}</ref> Hemingway scholar Hallengren believes the "hard boiled style",  and the machismo, must be separated from the author himself. <ref name="Harvnb|Hallengren"/> Benson agrees, describing him as introverted and private as [[J. D. Salinger]], although Hemingway masked his nature with braggadocio.<ref>{{Harvnb|Benson|1989|p=349}}</ref>  In fact, during World War II, Salinger met and corresponded with Hemingway, whom he acknowledged as an influence.<ref>{{cite news|last=Lamb|first=Robert Paul|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0403/is_n4_v42/ai_20119140/pg_17|title=Hemingway and the creation of twentieth-century dialogue <U+2013> American author Ernest Hemingway|publisher=Twentieth Century Literature|date=Winter 1996|accessdate=2007-07-10|format=reprint}}</ref> In a letter to Hemingway, Salinger wrote that their talks "had given him his only hopeful minutes of the entire war", and jokingly "named himself national chairman of the Hemingway Fan Clubs".<ref>{{Harvnb|Baker|1969|p=420}}</ref>

The extent of Hemingway's influence is seen in the tributes, and echoes of his fiction found in popular culture. The [[International Imitation Hemingway Competition]] was created in the 1980s to publicly acknowledge his influence and the comically misplaced efforts of lesser authors to imitate his style.  Entrants are encouraged to submit one "really good page of really bad Hemingway", and winners are flown to Italy to Harry's Bar there.<ref name="LA">[http://articles.latimes.com/1993-03-15/news/vw-308_1_bad-hemingway  Wanted: One Really Good Page of Really Bad Hemingway] Jack Smith.

In 1965 Mary Hemingway established the Hemingway Foundation, and in the 1970s she donated her husband's papers to the John F. Kennedy Library. In 1980 a group of Hemingway scholars gathered to assess the donated papers, subsequently forming the Hemingway Society, "committed to supporting and fostering Hemingway scholarship."<ref>{{Harvnb|Miller|2006}}</ref>

Almost exactly 35 years after Hemingway's death, on July 1, 1996, his granddaughter [[Margaux Hemingway]] died in [[Santa Monica]], California.
