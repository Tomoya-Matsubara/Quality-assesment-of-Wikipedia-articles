The '''Olmec colossal heads''' consist of at least seventeen momumental stone representations of human male heads sculpted from large [[basalt]] boulders. The heads date from at least before 900 BC and are a distinctive feature of the [[Olmec]] civilization of ancient [[Mesoamerica]].<ref name="Diehl04p111">Diehl 2004, p. 111.</ref> All portray mature men with fleshy cheeks, flat noses and slightly crossed eyes; their physical characteristics correspond to a type that is still common among the inhabitants of Tabasco and Veracruz. The backs of the monuments often flat. The boulders were brought from the [[Sierra de los Tuxtlas]] mountains of Veracruz; given that the extremly large slabs stone used in their production were transported over large distances, presumably involving a great deal of people and resources, it is thought that finished momuments represent portraits of powerful individual Olmec rulers; each is given a distinctive headdress. The heads were variously arranged in lines or groups at major Olmec centres, but the method and logistics used to transport the stone to these sites remain unclear. 

The discovery of a colossal head at Tres Zapotes in the 19th century spurred the first archaeological investigations of Olmec culture by Matthew Stirling in 1938. Seventeen confirmed examples are known from four within the [[Olmec heartland]] on the [[Gulf Coast of Mexico]]. Most colossal heads were sculpted from spherical boulders but two from [[San Lorenzo Tenochtitl<U+00E1>n]] were re-carved from massive stone thrones. An additional monument, at [[Takalik Abaj]] in [[Guatemala]], is a throne that may have been carved from a colossal head. This is the only known example from outside the Olmec heartland. 

Dating the monuments remains difficult due to the movement of many from their original context prior to archaeological investigation. Most have been dated to the Early [[Mesoamerican chronology#Preclassic Era|Preclassic]] period (1500<U+2013>1000&nbsp;BC) with some to the Middle Preclassic (1000<U+2013>400&nbsp;BC) period. The smallest weigh 6 tons, while the largest is variously estimated to weigh 40 to 50 tons, although this was abandoned and left unfinished near to the source of its stone.

==Olmec civilization==
{{Main|Olmec}}
[[File:Olmec mask 802.jpg|thumb|left|"Olmec-style" face mask in [[jade use in Mesoamerica|jade]]]]
The Olmec civilization developed in the lowlands of southeastern Mexico between 1500 and 400 BC.<ref name="Diehl04p11-12"/> The [[Olmec heartland]] lies on the [[Gulf Coast of Mexico]] within the states of [[Veracruz]] and [[Tabasco]], an area measuring approximately {{convert|275|km|mi}} east to west and extending about {{convert|100|km|mi}} inland from the coast.<ref>Diehl 2004, p. 111. Pool 2007, p. 5.</ref> The Olmecs are regarded as the first civilization to develop in Mesoamerica and the Olmec heartland is one of six cradles of civilization worldwide, the others being the [[Chav<U+00ED>n culture]] of South America, the [[Shang Dynasty|Shang Culture]] of China, the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] of south Asia, the civilization of [[Ancient Egypt]] and the [[Sumer|Sumerian civilization]] of ancient Iraq. Of these, only the Olmec civilization developed in a [[Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|lowland tropical forest]] setting. 

The Olmecs were the first inhabitants of the Americas to construct monumental architecture and to settle in towns and cities. They were also the first people in the Americas to develop a sophisticated style of stone sculpture.<ref name="Diehl04p11-12"/> In the first decade of the 21st century evidence emerged of Olmec writing, with the earliest examples of Olmec hieroglyphs dating to around 650 BC. Examples of script have been found on roller stamps and stone artefacts; the texts are short and have been partially deciphered based on their similarity to other [[Mesoamerican writing systems|Mesoamerican scripts]].<ref>Diehl 2004, pp. 96-97.</ref> The evidence of complex society developing in the Olmec heartland has led to the Olmecs being regarded as the "Mother Culture" of Mesoamerica,<ref name="Diehl04p11-12">Diehl 2004, pp. 11<U+2013>12.</ref> although this concept remains controversial.<ref>Taube summarizes recent contributions to the debate at pp. 41<U+2013>42</ref>

[[File:Olmec - Infantile Figure - Walters 20092064 - Three Quarter.jpg|right|thumb|Pottery [[Olmec figurine]] of an "infantile figure", a common and distinct Olmec type]]
Some of the Olmecs rulers seem to have served religious functions. The city of [[San Lorenzo Tenochtitl<U+00E1>n|San Lorenzo]] was succeeded as the main centre of the civilization by [[La Venta]] in about 900 BC, with [[Tres Zapotes]] and [[Laguna de los Cerros]] possibly sharing the role; other urban centres were much less significant.   The nature and degree of the control excercised by the centres over a widespread rural population remains unclear.<ref>Taube, 6<U+2013>12</ref>  Very fine Olmec art, much clearly made for an elite,<ref>Taube, pp. 18<U+2013>19; 24<U+2013>25</ref> survives in several forms, notably [[Olmec figurines]], and larger sculptures such as ''[[The Wrestler (sculpture)|The Wrestler]]''.  The figurines have been recovered in large numbers and are mostly in pottery; these were presumably widely available to the population.  Together with these, of particular relevance to the colossal heads are the "Olmec-style masks" in stone,<ref>Taube, pp. 145<U+2013>150</ref> so called because none have yet been excavated in circumstances that allow the proper archaeological identification of an Olmec context.  These evocative stone face masks present both similarities and differences to the colossal heads. Two thirds of Olmec monumental sculpture represents the human form, and the colossal heads fall within this major theme of Olmec art.<ref>de la Fuente 1996a, p. 42.</ref>

==Dating==
The colossal heads cannot be precisely dated but the San Lorenzo heads were buried by 900&nbsp;BC, indicating that their period of manufacture and use was earlier still. The heads from Tres Zapotes had been moved from their original context before they were investigated by archaeologists and the heads from [[La Venta]] were found partially exposed on the modern ground surface. Due to these factors, the period of production of the colossal heads is not known, nor whether it spanned a century or a millennium.<ref name="Diehl04p112"/> Estimates of the time span during which colossal heads were produced vary from 50 years to 200 years.<ref>Diehl 2004, p. 112. Pool 2007, p. 118.</ref> The San Lorenzo heads are believed to be the oldest examples of the type and are the most skillfully executed.<ref name="delafuente96p4849">de la Fuente 1996a, pp.&nbsp;48<U+2013>49.</ref> All of the stone heads have been assigned to the Preclassic period of [[Mesoamerican chronology]], generally to the Early Preclassic (1500<U+2013>1000&nbsp;BC), although the two Tres Zapotes heads and the La Cobata Head are attributed to the Middle Preclassic (1000<U+2013>400&nbsp;BC).<ref>Pool 2007, pp. 7, 117<U+2013>118, 251.</ref>

==Characteristics==
Olmec colossal heads vary in height from {{convert|1.47|to|3.4|m|ft}} and weigh between 6 and 50 tons.<ref name="Pool07p106">Pool 2007, p. 106.</ref> All of the Olmec colossal heads depict mature men with flat noses and fleshy cheeks; the eyes tend to be slightly crossed. The general physical characteristics of the heads are of a type that is still common among people in the Olmec region in modern times. The backs of the heads are often flat, as if the monuments were originally placed against a wall.<ref name="Diehl04p111"/> All examples of Olmec colossal heads wear distinctive headdresses that probably represent cloth or animal hide originals.<ref>Diehl 2004, pp.&nbsp;111<U+2013>112.</ref> Some examples have a tied knot at the back of the head, and some are decorated with feathers. A head from La Venta is decorated with the head of a bird. There are similarities between the headdresses on some of the heads that has led to speculation that specific headdresses may represent different dynasties, or perhaps identify specific rulers. Most of the heads wear large [[Plug (jewellery)|earspools]] inserted into the ear lobes.<ref name="Diehl04p112">Diehl 2004, p. 112.</ref>

[[File:Cabeza Colosal n<U+00BA>1 del Museo Xalapa.jpg|thumb|right|San Lorenzo Colossal Head&nbsp;1]]
All of the heads are realistic, unidealised and frank descriptions of the men. It is likely that they were portraits of living (or recently deceased) rulers well known to the sculptors.<ref name="Diehl04p112"/> Each head is distinct and naturalistic, displaying individualised features.<ref name="delafuente96p4849"/> They were once thought to represent ballplayers although this theory is no longer widely held; it is possible, however, that they represent rulers equipped for the [[Mesoamerican ballgame]].<ref name="Diehl04p112"/> Expressions depicted on the heads vary from stern through placid to smiling.<ref name="Pool07p106"/> The most naturalistic Olmec art is the earliest, appearing suddenly without surviving antecedents, with a tendency towards more stylised sculpture as time progressed.<ref name="Diehl04p108">Diehl 2004, p. 108.</ref> Some surviving examples of wooden sculpture recovered from [[El Manat<U+00ED>]] demonstrate that the Olmecs are likely to have created many more perishable sculptures than works sculpted from stone.<ref name="Diehl04p109">Diehl 2004, p. 109.</ref>

In the late 19th century, Jos<U+00E9> Melgar y Serrano described a colossal head as having "Ethiopian" features and speculations that the Olmec had [[Olmec alternative origin speculations|African origins]] resurfaced in 1960 in the work of Alfonso Medell<U+00ED>n Zenil and in the 1970s in the writings of [[Ivan van Sertima]].<ref>de la Fuente 1996a, p. 48. Diehl 2004, pp. 112, 194c5n6.</ref> Such speculation is not taken seriously by Mesoamerican scholars such as [[Richard Diehl]] and Ann Cyphers.<ref>Diehl 2004, p.112. Cyphers 1996, p. 156.</ref>

Although all the colossal heads are broadly similar, there are distinct stylistic differences in their execution.<ref name="delafuente96p4849"/> One of the heads from San Lorenzo bears traces of plaster and red paint, suggesting that the heads were originally brightly decorated.<ref name="Diehl04p112"/> Heads did not just represent individual Olmec rulers; they also incorporated the very concept of rulership itself.<ref>Pool 2007, p. 118.</ref>

==Manufacture==
The production of each colossal head must have been carefully planned, given the effort required to ensure the necessary resources were available; it seems likely that only the more powerful Olmec rulers were able to mobilise such resources. The workforce would have included sculptors, labourers, overseers, boatmen, woodworkers and other artesans producing the tools to make and move the monument, in addition to the support needed to feed and otherwise attend to these workers. The seaonal and agricultural cycles and river levels needed to have been taken into account to plan the production of the monument and the whole project may well have taken years from beginning to end.<ref>Diehl 2011, pp. 193<U+2013>194.</ref>

[[File:La Venta Colossal Head 3.jpg|thumb|left|The unfinished La Venta Colossal Head&nbsp;3]]
Archaeological investigation of Olmec basalt workshops suggest that the colossal heads were first roughly shaped using direct percussion to chip away both large and small flakes of stone. The sculpture was then refined by retouching the surface using [[hammerstone]]s, which were generally rounded cobbles that could be of the same basalt as the monument intself, although this was not always the case. Abrasives were found in association with workshops at San Lorenzo and indicates their use in the finishing of fine detail. Olmec colossal heads were fashioned as in-the-round monuments with varying levels of [[relief]] on the same work; they tended to feature higher relief on the face and lower relief on the earspools and headdresses.<ref name="Pool07p110">Pool 2007, p. 110.</ref> Monument&nbsp;20 at San Lorenzo is an extensively damaged throne with a figure emerging from a niche. Its sides were broken away and it was dragged to another location before being abandoned. It is possible that this damage was caused by the initial stages of re-carving the monument into a colossal head but that the work was never completed.<ref>Diehl 2004, p. 119.</ref>

All seventeen of the confirmed heads in the Olmec heartland were sculpted from [[basalt]] mined in the Sierra de los Tuxtlas mountains of Veracruz.<ref name="Hammond01"/> Most were formed from coarse grained dark grey basalt known as Cerro Cintepec basalt after a volcano in the range. Investigators have proposed that large Cerro Cintepec basalt boulders found on the southeastern slopes of the mountains are the source of the stone for the monuments.<ref name="Gillespie94p231">Gillespie 1994, p. 231.</ref> These boulders are found in an area affected by large [[lahar]]s (volcanic mudslides) that carried substantial blocks of stone down the mountain slopes, which suggests that the Olmecs did not need to quarry the raw material for sculpting the heads.<ref>Killion and Urcid 2001, p. 6.</ref> Roughly spherical boulders were carefully selected to mimic the shape of a human head.<ref>Hammond 2001. Diehl 2004, p. 111.</ref> The stone for the San Lorenzo and La Venta heads was transported a considerable distance from the source. The La Cobata head was found on El Vigia hill in the Sierra de los Tuxtlas and the stone from Tres Zapotes Colossal Head&nbsp;1 and Nestepe Colossal Head&nbsp;1 (also known as Tres Zapotes Monuments&nbsp;A and&nbsp;Q) came from the same hill.<ref name="Hammond01"/>

The boulders were transported over {{convert|150|km|mi}} from the source of the stone.<ref>Diehl 2000, p. 164.</ref> The exact method of transportation of such large masses of rock are unknown, especially since the Olmecs lacked beasts of burden and functional [[Wheel#History|wheels]],<ref name="Diehl04p118">Diehl 2004, p. 118.</ref> and they were likely to have used water transport whenever possible.<ref name="Hammond01"/> Leslie Hazell suggests that the coastal currents of the Gulf of Mexico and in river estuaries would have made the waterborne transport of monuments weighing 20 tons or more impractical.<ref>Hazell 2010, p. 2.</ref> Two badly damaged Olmec sculptures depict rectangular stone blocks bound with ropes. A largely destroyed human figure rides upon each block, with their legs hanging over the side. Richard Diehl argues that these sculptures depict Olmec rulers overseeing the transport of the stone that would be fashioned into their monuments.<ref name="Diehl04p118"/> When transport over land was necessary, the Olmecs are likely to have used causeways, ramps and roads to facilitate moving the heads.<ref name="Diehl11p185">Diehl 2011, p. 185.</ref> The regional terrain offers significant obstacles such as swamps and floodplains; avoiding these would have necessitated crossing undulating hill country. The construction of temporary causeways using the suitable and plentiful floodplain soils would have allowed a direct route across the floodplains to the San Lorenzo Plateau. Earth structures such as mounds, platforms and causeways upon the plateau demonstrate that the Olmec possessed the necessary knowledge and could commit the resources to build large-scale earthworks.<ref>Hazell 2010, pp. 2, 5, 8.</ref>

The flat backs of many of the heads were designed to fit the bases of the monumental thrones for which they were constructed for. Only four of the seventeen heartland heads do not have flattened backs, indicating the possibility that the majority were reworked monuments. Alternatively, the backs of many of the monuments may have been flattened to have ease the transport of these massive monuments,<ref name="Pool07p121"/> providing a stable form for hauling the monuments with ropes.<ref>Hazell 2010, p. 9.</ref> Two heads from San Lorenzo have traces of niches that are characteristic of monumental Olmec thrones and so were definitely reworked from earlier monuments.<ref name="Pool07p121">Pool 2007, p. 121.</ref>

===San Lorenzo===
The ten colossal heads from San Lorenzo originally formed two roughly parallel lines running north-south across the site.<ref>Diehl 2004, p. 35. Pool 2007, p. 122.</ref> Although some were recovered from ravines,<ref name="Pool07p122">Pool 2007, p. 122.</ref> they were found close to their original placements and had been buried by local erosion. These heads, together with a number of monumental stone thrones, probably formed a processional route across the site, powerfully displaying its dynastic history.<ref>Diehl 2004, p. 35.</ref> Two of the San Lorenzo heads had been re-carved from older thrones.<ref>Diehl 2004, p. 37.</ref>

'''San Lorenzo Colossal Head&nbsp;1''' (also known as '''San Lorenzo Monument&nbsp;1''')<ref name="CasellasCa<U+00F1>ellas04p147">Casellas Ca<U+00F1>ellas 2004, p. 147.</ref> was lying facing upwards when excavated. The erosion of a path passing on top of the monument uncovered its eye and led to the discovery of the Olmec site.<ref>Diehl 2004, plate VI.</ref> Colossal Head&nbsp;1 is {{convert|2.84|m|ft}} high;<ref>Coe and Koontz 1962, 2002, p. 4.</ref> it measures {{convert|2.11|m|ft}} wide and it weighs 25.3 tons. The monument was discovered partially buried at the edge of a gully by Matthew Stirling in 1945. When discovered it was lying on its back, looking upwards. It was associated with a large number of broken ceramic vessels and figurines.<ref name="CCp179"/> The majority of these ceramic remains have been dated to between 800 and 400 BC;<ref>Casellas Ca<U+00F1>ellas 2004, p. 180.

Coe and Koontz 1962, 2002, p. 9.</ref> The headdress possesses a plain band that is tied at the back of the head. The upper portion of the headdress is decorated with a U-shaped motif.<ref name="CCp180"/> This element descends across the front of the headdress, terminating on the forehead. On the front portion it is decorated with five semicircular motifs.<ref>Casellas Ca<U+00F1>ellas 2004, pp.&nbsp;179<U+2013>180.</ref> The scalp piece does not meet the horizontal band, leaving a space between the two pieces.

The lips are slightly parted without revealing the teeth. The cheeks are pronounced and the ears are particularly well executed.<ref name="CCp181">Casellas Ca<U+00F1>ellas 2004, p. 181.</ref> The face is slightly asymmetric, which may be due to error on the part of the sculptors or may accurately reflect the physical features of the portrait's subject.<ref name="CCp182">Casellas Ca<U+00F1>ellas 2004, p. 182.</ref> The head has been moved to the Museo de Antropolog<U+00ED>a de Xalapa ("Anthropological Museum of Xalapa").<ref name="CCp179">Casellas Ca<U+00F1>ellas 2004, p. 179.</ref>

'''San Lorenzo Colossal Head&nbsp;3''' is also known as '''San Lorenzo Monument&nbsp;3'''.<ref name="CasellasCa<U+00F1>ellas04p147"/> The head measures {{convert|1.78|m|ft}} high by {{convert|1.63|m|ft}} wide by {{convert|0.95|m|ft}} deep and weighs 9.4 tons. The head was discovered in a deep gully by Matthew Stirling in 1946; it was found lying face down and its excavation was difficult due to the wet conditions in the gully.<ref name="CCp189"/> Although the monument was found {{Convert|0.8|km|mi}} southwest of the main mound at San Lorenzo, its original location is unknown; erosion of the gully may have resulted in significant movement of the sculpture.<ref>Casellas Ca<U+00F1>ellas 2004, pp.&nbsp;189<U+2013>190.</ref> Head&nbsp;3 has been moved to the [[Museo de Antropolog<U+00ED>a de Xalapa]] ("Xalapa Anthropological Museum").<ref name="CCp189">Casellas Ca<U+00F1>ellas 2004, p. 189.</ref> The headdress is complex, with the horizontal basal band being formed by four horizontal cords, with diagonal folds above each eye.

A large flap formed of four cords drops down both sides of the head, completely covering the ears.<ref name="CCp190">Casellas Ca<U+00F1>ellas 2004, p. 190.</ref> The face has a typically frowning brow and, unusually, has clearly defined eyelids. The lips are thick and slightly parted; the front of the lower lip has broken away completely,<ref name="CCp191">Casellas Ca<U+00F1>ellas 2004, p. 191.</ref> and the lower front of the headdress is pitted with 27 irregularly spaced artificial depressions.<ref name="CCp192">Casellas Ca<U+00F1>ellas 2004, p. 192.</ref>

Above these symbols is an angular U-shaped decoration descending from the scalp. On each side of the monument a strap descends from the headdress, passing in front of the ear. Each ear has a prominent ear ornament that descends from the earlobe to the base of the monument. The features are those of a mature man, with wrinkles around the mouth, eyes and nose.<ref name="CCp164"/> Monument&nbsp;1 is the best preserved head at La Venta but has suffered from erosion, particularly at the back.<ref name="CCp166">Casellas Ca<U+00F1>ellas 2004, p. 166.</ref> The head was first described by [[Franz Blom]] and [[Oliver La Farge]] who investigated the La Venta remains on behalf of [[Tulane University]] in 1925. When discovered it was half-buried; its massive size meant that the discoverers were unable to excavate it completely. Matthew Stirling fully excavated the monument in 1940, after clearing the thick vegetation that had covered it in the intervening years. Monument&nbsp;1 has been moved to the [[Parque-Museo La Venta]] in [[Villahermosa]].<ref name="CCp163">Casellas Ca<U+00F1>ellas 2004, p. 163.</ref> The head was found in its original context; associated finds have been [[radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon dated]] to between 1000 and 600&nbsp;BC.<ref name="CCp164">Casellas Ca<U+00F1>ellas 2004, p. 164.</ref>

The head has a prominent headdress but this is badly eroded and any individual detail has been erased. A strap descends in front of the ear on each side of the head, descending as far as the earlobe. The head is adorned with ear ornaments in the form of a disc that covers the earlobe, with an associated clip or peg.<ref name="CCp168"/> The surviving details of the headdress and earflares are stylistically similar to those of Tres Zapotes Monument&nbsp;A.<ref>Casellas Ca<U+00F1>ellas 2004, pp.&nbsp;168<U+2013>169.</ref> The head has been moved to the [[Museo del Estado de Tabasco]] ("Tabasco State Museum") in Villahermosa.<ref name="CCp168">Casellas Ca<U+00F1>ellas 2004, p. 168.</ref>

'''La Venta Monument&nbsp;3''' stands {{convert|1.98|m|ft}} high and measures {{convert|1.6|m|ft}} wide by {{convert|1|m|ft}} deep; it weighs 12.8 tons. Monument&nbsp;3 was located a few metres to the east of Monument&nbsp;2, but was moved to the Parque-Museo La Venta in Villahermosa. Like the other La Venta heads, its context has been radiocarbon dated to between 1000 and 600&nbsp;BC.<ref name="CCp172">Casellas Ca<U+00F1>ellas 2004, p. 172.</ref> It appears unfinished and has suffered severe damage through weathering, making analysis difficult. It had a large headdress that reaches to the eyebrows but any details have been lost through erosion. Straps descend in front of each ear and continue to the base of the monument. The ears are wearing large flattened rings that overlap the straps; they probably represent jade ornaments of a type that have been recovered in the Olmec region. Although most of the facial detail is lost, the crinkling of the bridge of the nose is still evident, a feature that is common to the frowning expressions of the other Olmec colossal heads.<ref name="CCp173">Casellas Ca<U+00F1>ellas 2004, p. 173.</ref>

'''La Venta Monument&nbsp;4''' measures {{convert|2.26|m|ft}} high by {{convert|1.98|m|ft}} wide and {{convert|1.86|m|ft}} deep. It weighs 19.8 tons. It was found a few metres to the west of Monument&nbsp;2 and has been moved to the Parque-Museo La Venta.<ref name="CCp175">Casellas Ca<U+00F1>ellas 2004, p. 175.</ref> As with the other heads in the group, its archaeological context has been radiocarbon dated to between 1000 and 600 BC. The headress is elaborate and, although damaged, various details are still discernable. The base of the headress is formed by three horizontal strips running over the forehead. One side is decorated with a double-disc motif that may have been repeated on the other; if so, damage to the right side has obliterated any trace of it.<ref name="CCp176">Casellas Ca<U+00F1>ellas 2004, p. 176.</ref>  The top of the headdress is decorated with the clawed foot of a bird of prey.<ref>Pool 2007, p. 166. Casellas Ca<U+00F1>ellas 2004, p. 176.</ref> Either straps or plaits of hair descend on either side of the face, from the headdress to the base of the monument. Only one earspool survives, it is flat, in the form of a rounded square, and is decorated with a cross motif.<ref name="CCp176"/> The ears have been completely eroded away and the lips are damaged.<ref>Casellas Ca<U+00F1>ellas 2004, pp.&nbsp;177<U+2013>178.</ref> The surviving features display a frown and creasing around the nose and cheeks.<ref name="CCp177">Casellas Ca<U+00F1>ellas 2004, p. 177.</ref> The head displays prominent teeth.<ref name="Pool07p166">Pool 2007, p. 166.</ref>

The two heads at Tres Zapotes, with the La Cobata head,<ref>Diehl 2004, p. 46. Pool 2007, p. 251.</ref> are stylistically distinct from the other known examples. Beatriz de la Fuente views them as a late regional survival of an older tradition while other scholars argue that they are merely the kind of regional variant to be expected in a frontier settlement.<ref>Diehl 2004, p. 46.</ref> These heads are sculpted with relatively simple headdresses; they have squat, wide proportions and distinctive facial features.<ref name="Pool07p251">Pool 2007, p. 251.</ref> The two Tres Zapotes heads are the earliest known stone monuments from the site.<ref name="Pool07p250">Pool 2007, p. 250.</ref> The discovery of one of the Tres Zapotes heads in the 19th century led to the first archaeological investigations of Olmec culture, carried out by Matthew Stirling in 1938.<ref name="Diehl04p182"/>

'''Tres Zapotes Monument&nbsp;Q''' (also known as the '''Nestape Head''' and '''Tres Zapotes Colossal Head&nbsp;2''') measures {{convert|1.45|m|ft}} high by {{convert|1.34|m|ft}} wide by {{convert|1.26|m|ft}} deep and weighs 8.5 tons. Its exact date of discovery is unknown but is estimated to have been some time in the 1940s, when it was struck by machinery being used to clear vegetation from Nestape hill.<ref name="CC04p155"/> Monument&nbsp;Q was the eleventh colossal head to be discovered. It was moved to the plaza of Santiago Tuxtla in 1951 and remains there to this day.<ref name="CC04p156">Casellas Ca<U+00F1>ellas 2004, p. 156.</ref> Monument Q was first described by Williams and Heizer in an article published in 1965.<ref>Casellas Ca<U+00F1>ellas 2004, pp. 155<U+2013>156.</ref> The headdress is decorated with a frontal tongue-shaped ornament, and the back of the head is sculpted with seven plaits of hair bound with tassels. A strap descends from each side of the headdress, passing over the ears and to the base of the monument. The face has pronounced creases around the nose, mouth and eyes.<ref name="CC04p157">Casellas Ca<U+00F1>ellas 2004, p. 157.</ref>

===La Cobata===
The La Cobata region was the source of the basalt used for carving all of the colossal heads in the Olmec heartland.<ref name="Hammond01">Hammond 2001.</ref> The La Cobata colossal head was discovered in 1970 and was the fifteenth to be recorded.<ref name="Hammond01"/> It was discovered in a mountain pass in the Sierra de los Tuxtlas, on the north side of El Vigia volcano near to [[Santiago Tuxtla]].<ref>Hammond 2001. Pool 2007, pp. 56, 251.</ref> The head was largely buried when found; excavations uncovered a Late Classic (c. AD 600<U+2013>900) offering associated with the head consisting of a ceramic vessel and a {{convert|12|cm|in|adj=on}} long [[obsidian use in Mesoamerica|obsidian]] knife place pointing northwards towards the head. The offering is believed to have been deposited long after the head was sculpted.<ref>Casellas Ca<U+00F1>ellas 2004, p. 160.</ref> The La Cobata Head has been moved from its original location to the main plaza at Santiago.<ref name="Hammond01"/>

The Cobata head is more or less rounded and measures {{convert|3|by|3|m|ft}} by {{convert|3.4|m|ft}} high, making it the largest known head.<ref name="Hammond01"/> This massive sculpture is estimated to weigh 40 tons.<ref>Pool 2007, p. 56.</ref> It is stylistically distinct from the other examples, and Beatriz de la Fuente placed it late in the Olmec time frame. The characteristics of the sculpture have led to some investigators suggesting that it represents a deceased person. [[Norman Hammond]] argues that the apparent stylistic differences of the monument stem from its unfinished state rather than its late production. The eyes of the monument are closed, the nose is flattened and lacks nostrils and the mouth was not sculpted in a realistic manner. The headdress is in the form of a plain horizontal band.<ref name="Hammond01"/>

The original location of the La Cobata head was not a major archaeological site and it is likely that the head was either abandoned at its source or during transport to its intended destination. Various features of the head suggest that it was unfinished, such as a lack of symmetry below the mouth and an area of rough stone above the base. Rock was not removed from around the earspools as on other heads, and does not narrow towards the base. Large parts of the monument seem to be roughed out without finished detail. The right hand earspool also appears incomplete; the forward portion is marked with a sculpted line while the rear portion has been sculpted in relief, probably indicating that the right cheek and eye area were also unfinished. The La Cobata head was almost certainly carved from a raw boulder rather than being sculpted from a throne.<ref name="Hammond01"/>

===Takalik Abaj===
Takalik Abaj Monument&nbsp;23 dates to the [[Mesoamerican chronology#Preclassic Era|Middle Preclassic]] period,<ref>Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 239.</ref> and is found in Takalik Abaj, an important city in the foothills of the Guatemalan Pacific coast,<ref name="Diehl04p146"/> in the modern [[Departments of Guatemala|department]] of [[Retalhuleu]].<ref>Kelly 1996, p. 210.</ref> It appears to be an Olmec-style colossal head re-carved into a niche figure sculpture.<ref name="Diehl04p146">Diehl 2004, p. 146.</ref> If originally a colossal head then it would be the only known example from outside the Olmec heartland.<ref name="Pool07p57">Pool 2007, p. 57.</ref> 

[[File:Takalik Abaj Olmec sculpture 1.JPG|thumb|right|Takalik Abaj Monument&nbsp;23 was possibly the only Olmec head outside of the Olmec heartland and was reworked into a throne.]]
Monument&nbsp;23 is sculpted from [[andesite]] and falls in the middle of the size range for confirmed colossal heads. It stands {{convert|1.84|m|ft}} high and measures {{convert|1.2|m|ft}} wide by {{convert|1.56|m|ft}} deep. Like the examples from the Olmec heartland, the monument features a flat back.<ref name="Graham89p233">Graham 1989, p. 233.</ref> Lee Parsons contests John Graham's identification of Monument&nbsp;23 as a re-carved colossal head;<ref>Parsons 1986, p. 10.</ref> he viewed the side ornaments identified by Graham as ears as rather than the scrolled eyes of an open-jawed monster gazing upwards.<ref>Parsons 1986, p. 19.</ref> Countering this, James Porter has claimed that the re-carving of the face of a colossal head into a niche figure is clearly evident.<ref>Porter 1989, p. 26.</ref>

Monument&nbsp;23 was damaged in the mid-20th century by a local mason who attempted to break its exposed upper portion using a steel chisel. As a result the top is fragmented, although the broken pieces were recovered by archaeologists and have been put back into place.<ref name="Graham89p233"/>

Several colossal heads have been loaned to temporary exhibitions abroad; San Lorenzo Colossal Head 6 was loaned to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York in 1970.<ref name="CCp200"/> San Lorenzo Colossal Heads 4 and 8 were lent to the ''Olmec Art of Ancient Mexico'' exhibition in the [[National Gallery of Art]], [[Washington, D.C.]] that ran from 30 June to 20 October 1996.<ref>Benson and de la Fuente 1996, pp. 4, 154<U+2013>157.</ref> San Lorenzo Head 4 was again loaned in 2005, this time to the [[de Young Museum]] in San Francisco.<ref name="SFC"/> The de Young Museum was loaned a number of colossal heals for its ''Olmec: Colossal Masterworks of Ancient Mexico'' exhibition, which ran from 19 February to 8 May 2011.<ref name="deYoung11">de Young Museum 2011.</ref>

===Vandalism===
On 12 January 2009,<ref name="Jornada130109">L<U+00F3>pez, 13 January 2009.</ref> at least three people, including two Mexicans and one American, entered the Parque-Museo La Venta in Villahermosa and damaged just under 30 archaeological pieces.<ref name="Cronica130109">La Cr<U+00F3>nica de Hoy, 13 January 2009.</ref> All four of the La Venta colossal heads were among the vandalised objects.<ref>Guenter 2009.</ref> The vandals were all members of an evangelical church and appeared to have been carrying out a supposed pre-Columbian ritual, during which salts, grape juice and oil were thrown over the pieces.<ref>El Ma<U+00F1>ana, 12 January 2009.
