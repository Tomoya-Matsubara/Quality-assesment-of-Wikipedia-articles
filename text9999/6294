== Plot ==
''The Son of Neptune'' begins with Percy Jackson being chased by the [[Gorgon]] sisters. They intend to kill Percy to avenge the killing of their sister [[Medusa]] by him. Percy manages to escape and stumbles upon [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]], who gives him two options: to carry her through the Caldecott Tunnel and across the Little [[Tiber]] river (although he is warned that after crossing the Tiber he'll lose the curse of [[Achilles]]) or to retreat to the safety of the sea and live a long, happy life.

Percy chooses to carry her, and when he gets to Caldecott Tunnel he meets two other demigods: [[Hazel Levesque]] and [[Frank Zhang]]. They manage to slay the Gorgons and Percy is taken to the head of the camp, a girl named Reyna. He is then made part of the fifth cohort, Frank and Hazel's, and prepares for the night's war games. During the war games Frank and his friends impress everyone with their skills and after the games [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] appears. He claims Frank as his son and sends Percy, Hazel, and Frank on a quest to free [[Thanatos]], the god of Death, who is imprisoned in Alaska.

On the quest, they bump into an old man named Phineas, who is all-knowing and all-seeing. He tells them that he will reveal the location of Thanatos if they capture a harpy named Ella and bring her to him. Before capturing Ella, they learn that she can memorize anything she reads and decide to gamble with Phineas instead. Phineas and Percy will each drink a vial of Gorgon blood, one of which kills while the other heals. Phineas ends up dying and the trio discover the location in Phineas's pocket: [[Hubbard Glacier]].

On the way to Alaska, Hazel reveals that she was actually supposed to be dead but was rescued from the [[Asphodel Meadows|Fields of Asphodel]] by [[Nico di Angelo]] and that seventy years prior to the story she was originally started to wake up Alcyoneus but stopped him from rising the day he was due to escape. Frank learns that he can turn into any animal and is descended from Poseidon as well as Mars. At that point he reveals to Percy and Hazel that his life depends on a piece of firewood that he always keeps. When it burns out, he would die.

When they finally reach the glacier, they find Thanatos in chains. His chains cannot be broken unless melted by the "fire of life", i.e. Frank's firewood, so Frank started melting the chains as Hazel and Percy attacked Alcyoneus and his ghost legion, respectively. The trio eventually freed Thanatos and managed to drag Alcyoneus across the border into Canada, where Frank kills him.

The trio rushes back to [[Camp Jupiter]], where, with the help of Tyson, Mrs. O'Leary, and the Roman Legion they fend off the Giant Polybotes's army. After seeing the eagle standard , the legion regains their hope and fights with renewed energy. Percy then challenges the giant Polybotes (born to oppose Poseidon) to a duel, as the rest of the camp fights the rest of the monsters. Percy calls to [[Terminus (god)|Terminus]] to help him defeat the giant, as giants can only be defeated by both a god and demigod. Percy eventually beats Polybotes after a battle using the head of Terminus' statue as a weapon. After the battle the legion names Percy as praetor, one of the two leaders of the Roman camp. Nearing the end, the groups of Greek camp demigods inform Percy of their arrival through a video Scroll and Tyson.

== Major characters ==
{{main|List of characters in the Camp Half-Blood series}}
* [[Percy Jackson]]: A demigod son of [[Poseidon]], who was the main protagonist in the [[Percy Jackson & the Olympians|first Camp Half-Blood series]]. He and Jason Grace have been swapped, causing their memories to be taken away and Percy is sent to [[Camp Jupiter]], from which Jason originally came. He goes on a quest with Frank Zhang and Hazel Levesque to save Thanatos, Pluto's lieutenant and the guardian of the doors of death. He succeeds and at the end of the book, leads the Roman camp into battle against Gaea's forces and is made Praetor by the campers. His memories are restored at around the middle of the book, as Percy drinks the gorgons' blood when he challenges Phineas.

* [[Frank Zhang]]: A demigod son of [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]], he is also related to Poseidon through his mother's family. He has the ability to shapeshift from his Greek ancestor, the Prince of Pylos, Periclymenus, and is an excellent marksman with a bow. His life is linked to a stick of wood, and, as his grandmother tells him, when it is burnt up, he will die. He is picked to lead a quest to free Thanatos. He has a crush on Hazel. Despite Frank's father choosing him to lead the quest, Percy makes most of the team's decisions. By the end of the book, Frank decides to forget about worrying how long he'll live and just do his duty as his mother would - Mars implies this is what Frank will contribute to fulfilling the Prophecy of Seven. Frank is the only known demigod of both Greek (Poseidon) and Roman (Mars) descent with different abilities from different gods.

* [[Hazel Levesque]]: A demigod daughter of [[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]], she was born in 1929 and lived in New Orleans. Her mother asked for the riches of the earth and so precious metals and gems rise to the surface near Hazel, but they cause misfortune in those who keep them. She was tricked into raising Alcyoneus in Alaska by Gaea and died in 1942. Nico di Angelo rescued her from the Fields of Asphodel, giving her a second chance. She is the third member of the trio that goes on a quest for Thanatos. She harbors feelings for Frank and they kiss near the end of the book. She tames Arion, a horse the Amazons kept for their greatest warrior.

* Reyna: A demigod daughter of [[Bellona (goddess)|Bellona]], she is the sister of Hylla (queen of the Amazons) and was on Circe's Island in ''[[The Sea of Monsters]]''. She is a praetor of the Twelfth Legion. Like all the other Romans, she has a tattoo on her arm that spells "SPQR"(''Senatus Populusque Romanus''), translating into "The Senate and the People of Rome". She has dark hair and wears a purple cloak over her golden armor. Before Jason disappeared, she hints that she had a crush on him.

* [[The Heroes of Olympus|Ella]]: is a [[Harpy]], half-bird, half-woman. She has red hair and feathers, grey eyes, and a bony structure. She was one of the harpies sent to torture Phineas by stealing his food. She has memorized a lot of books and can recite from them word for word. She has extensive knowledge about the Romans and their culture. At the end of the book it is revealed that she has read the Syllibine books (Roman books of prophecy) and will have to be hidden from Octavian. Tyson appears to have a crush on her.
