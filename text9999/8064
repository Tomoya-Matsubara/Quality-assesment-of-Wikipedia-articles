"'''The Man from Jupiter'''" is the first episode of the [[List of Archer episodes#Season 3|third season]] of the American animated [[television series]] ''[[Archer (TV series)|Archer]]''. It originally aired on January 19, 2012 in the United States on [[FX (network)|FX]]. Sterling Archer ([[H. Jon Benjamin]]) is introduced to [[Burt Reynolds]], who is involved in a relationship with his mother Malory Archer ([[Jessica Walter]]). Sterling tries several attempts to end their relationship. Meanwhile, a group of Cuban [[hitmen]] set out to kill Sterling.

The episode was directed and written by series creator [[Adam Reed]]. Reynolds was announced as a guest star for the episode in October 2011. He edited much of the episode's script, after receiving it from Reed. "The Man from Jupiter" was well-received by television commentators, who praised the episode's cultural references, character development, and the storylines. Upon airing, it attracted 1.309 million viewers and a 0.7 rating in the 18<U+2013>49 demographic, according to [[Nielsen ratings]]. It subsequently became the eleventh highest-rated cable program of the day.

==Plot==
Sterling Archer ([[H. Jon Benjamin]]) drinks at a bar, after he unsuccessfully attempts to pick up a woman for sex. A man nearby laughs at Archer's incident. When Sterling threatens him, the man easily subdues him. Sterling suddenly realizes that the man is his idol, Burt Reynolds. After gushing to Burt about how much of a fan he is, Archer learns, much to his horror, Burt is dating his mother Malory Archer ([[Jessica Walter]]). A shocked Sterling passes out in the establishment, and by the next day is seen with a black eye. Sterling assures that it was an "involuntary reaction". 

Malory informs Sterling that a group of Cuban [[hitmen]] have established a warrant against him, which makes Sterling even more irate. Burt then calls Malory and asks her out to a movie premiere that night. Later that day, however, Malory gets a letter from Reynolds, saying that he is leaving her for a younger woman and moving back "to Tinseltown". However, Lana Kane ([[Aisha Tyler]]) quickly figures out that the letter was written by Sterling himself (citing how no star actor uses the term "Tinseltown"). She quickly figures out that Sterling visited Burt, knocking him out with knock-out gas, and taking him to his apartment. Lana, along with Cyril Figgs and Ray Gillette (Adam Reed), go to try to reason with Sterling. Once there, they encounter the Cuban hit squad, who believe Gillette is the real Sterling based on the recon photo they have and a firefight begins. Meanwhile, Sterling holds Burt hostage, promising to never let him date his mother again, but he is interrupted by the firefight between the ISIS agents and the Cubans. As they drive off, Sterling prepares to go after them, but Burt says that Sterling won't be able to catch up to them and that he can. Sterling agrees to a bet: If Burt can't catch up to them, he will leave for Hollywood and never call Malory again, and if he does, he can be allowed to continue dating Malory. 

Sterling agrees to this, which results in a hetic car chase that frightens Sterling some, despite Burt's expert driving that allows him to achieve many Hollywood driving stunts. During this, Burt tells Sterling that he needs to stop thinking of Malory as just his mother and rather think of her as a person with emotional (and sexual) needs, and that he should think about her happiness and not his. This seems to sway Sterling and at that point. Burt has been able to catch up to the ISIS agents and the Cubans and saves the ISIS agents. With that, the group drives back to a heartbroken Malory. Sterling apologizes for writing the phony letter and Burt takes Malory on their date to the movie premiere.

Series creator [[Adam Reed]] opined: "I think the only person on the planet who's a bigger fan of Burt Reynolds than me is Sterling Archer. Archer constantly tries to imitate Burt and always raves about Burt's movies and all-around awesomeness. So to have Burt recording voice-overs for the show was just amazing."<ref name=aol>{{cite news|url=http://www.aoltv.com/2011/10/31/burt-reynolds-archer/|title=Burt Reynolds to Guest on 'Archer,' Queen Latifah Gets a Talk Show & More TV News|first=Chris|last=Harnick|work=The Huffington Post|publisher=Arianna Huffington|date=October 31, 2011|accessdate=February 5, 2012}}</ref> After receiving the episode's script from Reed, Reynolds made several edits; while editing the script of the episode, Reynolds added a scene in which Sterling reveals that his career choice was largely influenced by his films.

"The Man from Jupiter" features several references relating to music, film, media, and other pop cultural phenomenon. The episode title is a reference to the television series ''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]'' and the town of [[Jupiter, Florida]], which is where Reynolds spent most of his childhood.<ref name=tv/><ref name=cinema>{{cite web|url=http://www.cinemablend.com/television/Archer-Watch-Season-3-Premiere-Man-From-Jupiter-38801.html|title=Archer Watch: Season 3 Premiere, The Man From Jupiter|first=Jesse|last=Carp|publisher=[[Cinema Blend]]|date=January 20, 2012|accessdate=February 5, 2012}}</ref> Sterling proclaims that his career path was largely influenced by Reynolds' film career, particularly his work in the musical film ''[[At Long Last Love]]'' (1975) and the spy cinema ''[[Operation C.I.A.]]'' (1965).<ref name=cinema/> Reed stated, "Archer says [that] ''Operation C.I.A.'' is why [he] became a spy.

===Critical response===
{{Quote box |width=30em | bgcolor=#ACE1AF |align=right  |quote=Season premieres are always nice because it's just fun to spend time with characters you haven't seen in a while all over again. And this episode was no exception. From Cheryl suggesting that Pam just tape up her fingers when they start to bleed while masturbating to Pam herself saying that she could drown a toddler in her panties when Reynolds showed up [...], there were great moments for every single regular and recurring character here.|salign=right |source=<U+2014>Todd VanDerWerff<ref name=av/>}}

"The Man from Jupiter" was widely lauded by television commentators. In his A- review, Todd VanDerWerff of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' felt that the episode contained many great moments and felt that it was a strong opening for the season.<ref name=av>{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/the-man-from-jupiter,67915/|title=The Man from Jupiter|last=VanDerWerff|first=Rodd|date=January 20, 2012|accessdate=February 6, 2012|work=[[The A.V. Club]]|publisher=[[The Onion]]}}</ref> VanDerWerff wrote: "''Archer'' has always been a show I enjoyed more for the fast-paced dialogue and weird office plots, but every so often, the show does something pretty awesome, even on what's probably a fairly limited budget, and it turns out an action sequence that you just won't see on most other animated shows. FX has usually chosen to open seasons with these big action episodes, for fairly obvious reasons, and this one has the added benefit of Burt Reynolds hanging out as another potential ratings bump."<ref name=av/> VanDerWerff noted that the storyline between Sterling Archer and his mother Mallory Archer was the highlight of "The Man from Jupiter"; "Archer's so often at odds with her because he's unable to see her as a person and not just his mother, as Reynolds expresses while roaring down the highway at dangerously high speeds. Until Archer accepts that Malory has needs<U+2014>some of them sexual<U+2014>he<U+2019>s always going to be trapped in a weird, co-dependent relationship with her. ''Archer'' isn't a show that tries to shove tons and tons of deep character moments into its episodes, which makes it all the better when it does do so. The show usually nails those little moments, and this was no exception."<ref name=av/> ''[[Creative Loafing]]'' journalist Scott Harrel asserted, "If the debut episode is any indication, you can expect another satisfying season from this intelligent, imaginative and button-pushing mix of high and low humor."<ref name=jz>{{cite web|url=http://cltampa.com/dailyloaf/archives/2012/01/20/television-review-archer-season-3-premiere-the-man-from-jupiter#.Ty8dyONWqY4|title=Television review: Archer Season 3 Premiere <U+2014> "The Man From Jupiter"|last=Harrel|first=Scott|date=January 20, 2012|work=[[Creative Loafing]]|accessdate=February 5, 2012}}</ref> Ross Bonaime of ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]'' issued the installment an 8.8 out of ten rating, signifying a "commendable" rating. Bonaime affirmed that Reed adequately developed the characters, citing that "The Man from Jupiter" further established greater expectations for the series.<ref name=paste>{{cite web|url=http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2012/01/archer-review-the-man-from-jupiter-episode-34.html|title=Archer Review: "The Man From Jupiter" (Episode 3.4)|first=Ross|last=Bonaime|work=[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]|publisher=[[Wolfgang's Vault]]|date=January 19, 2012|accessdate=February 6, 2012}}</ref>

Carp evaluated the script as "impeccably written", adding that "The Man from Jupiter" was a hilarious episode. Cites of adulation stemmed from the animation, which Carp described it as "likely the best you'll see anywhere on television."<ref name=cinema/> He wrote, "It's just so unique the way they use state of the art 3D computer animation to create a retrofitted look. It takes them months to animate each episode and the hard work really pays off in the unique visuals of the show."<ref name=cinema/> Writing for ''TV Fanatic'', Eric Hochberger stated that "if this week combined with the mini-series was any indication, we're in for a damn strong season of ''Archer''."<ref>{{cite web |title=Archer Review: A Mustache of Memories |url=http://www.tvfanatic.com/2012/01/archer-review-a-mustache-of-memories/|first=Eric|last=Hochberger|work=TV Fanatic|date=January 19, 2012|accessdate=February 6, 2012}}</ref>

Burt Reynolds' appearance was critically acclaimed by critics. VanDerWerff professed that he was surprised that it was executed well, as he avouched that shows featuring guest appearances ruin the chemistry of the main cast. "Episodes with big special guest stars can often ruin the rhythm of the main gang, but I was surprised at how readily the show incorporated Reynolds into the storyline, to the point where he almost felt like an organic part of the ensemble," avouched VanDerWerff.<ref name=av/> "The fact that he's still dating Malory at the end of the episode implies that he might pop back in as the season proceeds, and I wouldn't be adverse to that happening, where many special guest stars might make me roll my eyes in irritation."<ref name=av/> He praised the chemistry between Reynolds and Benjamin, and commended Reynolds for having the will power to poke fun at himself.<ref name=av/> Carp echoed similar sentiments; "[[H. Jon Benjamin]] alone is a voice-over superstar [...] but combined with Reynolds and the rest of the cast, that was some animated magic and a fantastic way to kick off the third season."<ref name=cinema/> Bonaime thought that Reynolds was "fine with being self-deprecating, and he gives some fantastic moments with Archer."<ref name=paste/> [[HitFix]]'s [[Alan Sepinwall]] enjoyed how Reynolds was utilized in "The Man from Jupiter". "There are times when it can feel awkward when a show spends an episode sucking up to a very special guest star, but it worked here because so much of Archer's personality<U+2014>and so much of the show's approach to action<U+2014>feels inspired by all those movies Reynolds did in the '70s and early '80s when he was the biggest movie star in the world.<ref name=hit>{{cite web|url=http://www.hitfix.com/blogs/whats-alan-watching/posts/archer-the-man-from-jupiter-burt-reynolds-is-the-bomb|title=Season premiere review: 'Archer' - 'The Man from Jupiter': Burt Reynolds is the bomb|first=Alan|last=Sepinwall|publisher=[[HitFix]]|date=January 20, 2012|accessdate=February 6, 2012}}</ref>
