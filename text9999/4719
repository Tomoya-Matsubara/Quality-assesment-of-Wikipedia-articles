===Political career===

Prago, "Gil Green (b. 1906)," in Mari Jo Buhle, Paul Buhle, and Dan Georgakas (eds.), ''Encyclopedia of the American Left.'' First edition. New York: Garland Publishing, 1990, pg. 279.</ref> In 1935 Green was named one of three communist youth leaders named to the [[Executive Committee of the Communist International|Executive Committee]] of the [[Communist International]] in [[Moscow]].<ref name=Prago />

Later in 1935, the 6th World Congress of the [[Young Communist International]] (YCI) elected Green to the Executive Committee and Secretariat of that body.<ref name=Prago />

Green remained a prominent youth leader of the American Communist Party throughout the depression decade, attending the 1936 World Youth Congress held in [[Geneva]] and serving as one of three YCI delegates to a meeting with the rival [[Socialist Youth International]] that drew up a unity agreement with regards to aiding the [[Second Spanish Republic|Spanish Republic]] in the ongoing [[Spanish Civil War]].<ref name=Prago /> Green was also a delegate to the 1938 World Youth Congress held in the United States at [[Vassar College]].<ref name=Prago />

Leaving the communist youth movement at the end of the decade, Green was selected as a member of the National Board of the Communist Party, USA.<ref name=Prago /> He served as the party's top official, the district organizer, of the key party districts of New York (1941-1945, 1966-1968) and Illinois.<ref name=Prago />

Green's status as a top official of the Communist Party made him a target for prosecution during the [[McCarthyism|McCarthy era]]. Green was indicted in July 1948 under the [[Smith Act]] and convicted and sentenced to a long term of imprisonment after a lengthy 1949 trial.<ref name=Prago /> Green elected to become a fugitive from justice, remaining in the underground until voluntarily surrendering to authorities on February 27, 1956,<ref name=Prago /> Thereafter, Green was incarcerated in federal prison until July 29, 1961.<ref name=Prago />

In 1991, following the collapse of communism in the [[Soviet Union]], Green left the party and helped found the [[Committees of Correspondence for Democracy and Socialism]].
