The '''Shunzhi Emperor''' ([[Wade-Giles]]: '''Shun-chih Emperor'''; {{zh|c=<U+9806><U+6CBB><U+5E1D>|p=Sh<U+00F9>nzh<U+00EC>d<U+00EC>}}; [[Manchu language|Manchu]]: [[Image:Shunzhi1.PNG|40px]] ''ijish<U+016B>n dasan h<U+016B>wangdi''; [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]]: Eyebeer Zasagch Khaan; 15 March 1638&nbsp;<U+2013> 5 February 1661), was the third [[Emperor of China|emperor]] of the [[Qing dynasty]] and the first Qing (pronounced "Ch'ing") emperor to rule over [[China]], which he did from 1644 to 1661. A [[Deliberative Council of Princes and Ministers|committee of Manchu princes]] chose him to succeed his father [[Hong Taiji]] (1592<U+2013>1643) in September 1643 when he was five years old. The [[Qing Dynasty nobility|princes]] also appointed two co-regents: [[Dorgon]] (1612<U+2013>1650), fourteenth son of Qing founder [[Nurhaci]] (1559<U+2013>1626), and [[Jirgalang]] (1599<U+2013>1655), one of Nurhaci's nephews, both of whom were members of [[Aisin Gioro|the Qing imperial clan]].

From 1643 to 1650, political power lay mostly in the hands of Dorgon. Under his leadership, the Qing conquered most of the territory of the fallen [[Ming dynasty]] (1368<U+2013>1644), chased [[Southern Ming Dynasty|Ming loyalist regimes]] deep into the southwestern provinces, and established the basis of Qing rule over China despite highly unpopular policies like the "haircutting command" of 1645, which forced Qing subjects to shave their forehead and braid their remaining hair into a [[queue (hairstyle)|queue]] like the [[Manchu people|Manchus]]. After Dorgon's death on the last day of 1650, the young monarch started to rule personally. He tried, with mixed success, to fight corruption and to reduce the political influence of the Manchu nobility. In the 1650s he faced a resurgence of Ming loyalist resistance, but by 1661 his armies had defeated the Qing's last enemies, seafarer [[Koxinga]] (1624<U+2013>1662) and the [[Prince of Gui]] (1623<U+2013>1662) of the [[Southern Ming]], both of whom would succomb the following year. The Shunzhi emperor died at the age of 22 of [[smallpox]], a highly [[Infectious disease|contagious disease]] that was [[Endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] in China, but against which the Manchus had no [[Immunity (medical)|immunity]]. He was succeeded by his third son [[Xuanye]], who had already survived smallpox, and who subsequently reigned for sixty years under the name of [[Kangxi]]. Because fewer documents have survived from the Shunzhi era than from later Qing reigns, the Shunzhi age is a relatively little-known period of Qing history.

"Shunzhi" was the name of this ruler's [[Chinese era name|reign period]] in Chinese. This title had equivalents in Manchu and Mongolian because the Qing imperial family was Manchu, and ruled over many [[Mongol people|Mongol tribes]] that helped the Qing to [[Manchu conquest of China|conquer China]]. The emperor's personal name was '''Fulin''', and the [[temple name|posthumous name]] by which he was worshipped at the [[Imperial Ancestral Temple]] was '''Shizu''' (Wade-Giles: '''Shih-tsu'''; Chinese: <U+4E16><U+7956>).

==Historical background==
[[File:Jurchen woodblock print.png|thumb|left|alt=Black-and-white print of a severe-looking man with long rising eyebrows and a mustache, wearing skin shoes, a round-edged fur cap, and clothing with several folds held together by a sash and surmounted by a fur collar.

The original caption explained that the Jurchens lived near the [[Changbai Mountains]] and wore "deerskin shoes and fish-scale clothing."<ref>{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|page=34}}.</ref>]]

In the 1580s, when China was ruled by the [[Ming dynasty]] (1368<U+2013>1644), a number of [[Jurchen people|Jurchen tribes]] lived northeast of Ming territory in the region that is now known as [[Northeast China|China's Northeast]], or "[[Manchuria]]."<ref>{{harvnb|Roth Li|2002|pp=25<U+2013>26}}.</ref> In a series of campaigns from the 1580s to the 1610s, [[Nurhaci]] (1559<U+2013>1626), the leader of the [[Jianzhou Jurchens]], unified most Jurchen tribes under his rule.<ref>{{harvnb|Roth Li|2002|pp=29<U+2013>30}} (campaigns of Jurchen unification) and 40 (seizing of patents).</ref> One of his most important reforms was to integrate Jurchen clans under flags of four different colors<U+2013><U+2013>yellow, white, red, and blue<U+2013><U+2013>each further subdivided into two to form an encompassing social and military system known as the [[Eight Banners]].<ref>{{harvnb|Roth Li|2002|p=34}}.</ref> Nurhaci gave control of these Banners to his sons and grand-sons.<ref>{{harvnb|Roth Li|2002|p=36}}.</ref> Around 1612, Nurhaci renamed his clan [[Aisin Gioro]] ("golden Gioro"), both to distinguish his family from other Gioro lines and to allude to an earlier dynasty that had been founded by Jurchens, the [[Jin dynasty (1115<U+2013>1234)|Jin ("golden") dynasty]] that had ruled northern China from 1115 to 1234.<ref>{{harvnb|Roth Li|2002|p=28}}.</ref> In 1616 Nurhaci formally announced the foundation of the [[Qing dynasty|"Later Jin" dynasty]], effectively declaring his independence from the Ming.<ref>{{harvnb|Roth Li|2002|p=37}}.</ref> Over the next few years he wrested most major cities in Liaodong from Ming control.<ref>{{harvnb|Roth Li|2002|p=42}}.</ref> His string of victories ended in February 1626 at the [[Battle of Ningyuan|siege of Ningyuan]], where Ming commander [[Yuan Chonghuan]] defeated him with the help of recently acquired Portuguese [[cannon]].<ref>{{harvnb|Roth Li|2002|p=46}}.</ref> Probably hurt during the battle, Nurhaci died a few months later.<ref>{{harvnb|Roth Li|2002|p=51}}.</ref>

Nurhaci's son and successor [[Hong Taiji]] (1592<U+2013>1643) continued his father's state-building efforts: he concentrated power into his own hands, modeled the Later Jin's government institutions on Chinese ones, and integrated Mongol allies and surrendered Chinese troops into the Eight Banners.<ref>{{harvnb|Elliott|2001|p=63}}.</ref> In 1629 he led an incursion to the outskirts of Beijing, during which he captured Chinese craftsmen who knew how to cast Portuguese cannon.<ref>{{harvnb|Roth Li|2002|pp=29<U+2013>30}}.</ref> In 1635 Hong Taiji renamed the Jurchens the "[[Manchu people|Manchus]]," and in 1636 changed the name of his polity from "Later Jin" to "[[Qing dynasty|Qing]]."<ref>{{harvnb|Roth Li|2002|p=63}}.</ref> After [[Battle of Songjin|capturing the last remaining Ming cities]] in Liaodong, by 1643 the Qing was preparing to seize upon the struggling Ming dynasty, which was crumbling under the combined weight of financial bankruptcy, devastating epidemics, and large-scale bandit uprisings fed by widespread starvation.<ref>{{harvnb|Elliott|2001|p=64}} (preparing to attack the Ming); {{harvnb|Spence|1999|pp=21<U+2013>24}} (late Ming crises).</ref>

When Hong Taiji died on 21 September 1643 without having named a successor, the fledgling Qing state faced a possibly serious crisis.<ref>{{harvnb|Oxnam|1975}} (p. 38), {{harvnb|Wakeman|1985}} (p. 297), and {{harvnb|Gong|2010}} (p. 51) all place Hong Taiji's death on September 21 (Chongde <U+5D07><U+5FB7> 8.8.9). {{harvnb|Dennerline|2002}} (p. 74) gives the date as September 9.</ref> Several contenders<U+2013><U+2013>namely Nurhaci's second and eldest surviving son [[Dai<U+0161>an]], Nurhaci's fourteenth and fifteenth sons [[Dorgon]] and [[Dodo (prince)|Dodo]] (both born to the same mother), and Hong Taiji's eldest son [[Hooge (prince)|Hooge]]<U+2013><U+2013>started to vie for the throne.<ref>{{harvnb|Rawski|1998|p=98}}.</ref> With his brothers Dodo and [[Ajige]], Dorgon (31 years old) controlled the Plain and Bordered White [[Eight Banners|Banners]], Dai<U+0161>an (60) was in charge of the two Red Banners, whereas Hooge (34) had the loyalty of his father's two Yellow Banners.<ref>{{harvnb|Rawski|1998|p=99}} (about the White and Yellow banners); {{harvnb|Dennerline|2002|p=79}} (table with age of the imperial princes and the banners they controlled).</ref>

The decision about who would become the new Qing emperor fell to the [[Deliberative Council of Princes and Ministers]], which was the Manchus' main policymaking body until the emergence of the [[Grand Council (Qing Dynasty)|Grand Council]] in the 1720s.<ref>{{harvnb|Dennerline|2002|p=77}} (convening of the Deliberative Council to discuss Hong Taiji's succession); {{harvnb|Hucker|1985|p=266}} (Deliberative Council as "the most influential shaper of policy in the early Ch'ing" [i.e., Qing]; {{harvnb|Bartlett|1991|p=1}} (the Grand Council rose "to the overlordship of almost the entire central government of the Chinese empire" in the 1720s and 1730s).</ref> Many Manchu princes advocated that Dorgon, a proven military leader, should become the new emperor, but Dorgon refused and insisted that one of Hong Taiji's sons should succeed his father.<ref name="Dennerline 78">{{harvnb|Dennerline|2002|p=78}}.</ref> To recognize Dorgon's authority while keeping the throne in Hong Taiji's descent line, the members of the council named Hong Taiji's ninth son Fulin as the new Emperor, but decided that Dorgon and [[Jirgalang]] (a nephew of Nurhaci who controlled the Bordered Blue Banner) would act as the five-year-old child's [[regent]]s.<ref name="Dennerline 78"/> Fulin was officially crowned [[Emperor of China|Emperor]] of the Qing dynasty on 8 October 1643; it was decided that he would reign under the [[Chinese era name|era name]] "Shunzhi."<ref>{{harvnb|Fang|1943a|p=255}}.</ref> Because the Shunzhi reign is not well documented, it constitutes a relatively little-known period of Qing history.<ref>{{harvnb|Dennerline|2002|p=73}}.</ref>

He reigned as a quasi emperor from 1643 to his death in 1650, a period during which the Qing [[Manchu conquest of China|conquered almost all of China]].]]

===A quasi emperor===
On 17 February 1644, Jirgalang, who was a capable military leader but looked uninterested in managing state affairs, willingly yielded control of all official matters to Dorgon.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wakeman|1985|p=299}}.</ref> After an alleged plot by Hooge to undermine the regency was exposed on 6 May of that year, Hooge was stripped of his title of Imperial Prince and his co-conspirators were executed.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wakeman|1985|p=300}}, note 231.</ref> Dorgon soon replaced Hooge's supporters (mostly from the Yellow Banners) with his own, thus gaining closer control of two more Banners.<ref>{{harvnb|Dennerline|2002|p=79}}.</ref> By early June 1644, he was in firm control of the Qing government and its military.<ref>{{harvnb|Roth Li|2002|p=71}}.</ref>

In early 1644, just as Dorgon and his advisors were pondering how to attack the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]], peasant rebellions were dangerously approaching [[Beijing]]. On 24 April of that year, rebel leader [[Li Zicheng]] breached the walls of the Ming capital, pushing the [[Chongzhen Emperor]] to hang himself on a hill behind the [[Forbidden City]].<ref>{{harvnb|Mote|1999|p=809}}.</ref> Hearing the news, Dorgon's Chinese advisors [[Hong Chengchou]] and [[Fan Wencheng]] (<U+8303><U+6587><U+7A0B>; 1597<U+2013>1666) urged the Manchu prince to seize this opportunity to present themselves as avengers of the fallen Ming and to claim the [[Mandate of Heaven]] for the Qing.<ref>{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|p=304}}; {{harvnb|Dennerline|2002|p=81}}.</ref> The last obstacle between Dorgon and Beijing was Ming general [[Wu Sangui]], who was garrisoned at [[Shanhai Pass]] at the eastern end of the [[Great Wall]].<ref>{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|p=290}}.</ref> Himself caught between the Manchus and Li Zicheng's forces, Wu requested Dorgon's help in ousting the bandits and restoring the Ming.<ref>{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|p=304}}.</ref> When Dorgon asked Wu to work for the Qing instead, Wu had little choice but to accept.<ref>{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|p=308}}.</ref> Aided by Wu Sangui's elite soldiers, who fought the rebel army for hours before Dorgon finally chose to intervene with his cavalry, the Qing won a decisive victory against Li Zicheng at the [[Battle of Shanhai Pass]] on 27 May.<ref>{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|pp=311<U+2013>12}}.</ref> Li's defeated troops looted Beijing for several days until Li left the capital on 4 June with all the wealth he could carry.<ref>{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|p=313}}; {{Harvnb|Mote|1999|p=817}}.</ref>

===Settling in the capital===

The ceremony marked the moment when the Qing dynasty seized the [[Mandate of Heaven]].]]

After six weeks of mistreatment at the hands of rebel troops, the Beijing population sent a party of elders and officials to greet their liberators on 5 June.<ref>{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|p=313}}.</ref> They were startled when, instead of meeting Wu Sangui and the Ming heir apparent, they saw Dorgon, a horseriding Manchu with his shaved forehead, present himself as the Prince Regent.<ref>{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|p=314}} (were all expecting Wu and the heir apparent) and 315 (reaction to seeing Dorgon instead).</ref> In the midst of this upheaval, Dorgon installed himself in the Wuying Palace (<U+6B66><U+82F1><U+6BBF>), the only building that remained more or less intact after Li Zicheng had set fire to the palace complex on 3 June.<ref>{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|p=315}}.</ref> Banner troops were ordered not to loot; their discipline made the transition to Qing rule "remarkably smooth."<ref>{{harvnb|Naquin|2000|p=289}}.</ref> Yet at the same time as he claimed to have come to avenge the Ming, Dorgon ordered that all claimants to the Ming throne (including descendants of the last Ming emperor) should be executed along with their supporters.<ref>{{harvnb|Mote|1999|p=818}}.</ref>

On June 7, just two days after entering the city, Dorgon issued special proclamations to officials around the capital, assuring them that if the local population accepted to shave their forehead, wear a queue, and surrender, the officials would be allowed to stay at their post.<ref>{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|p=416}}; {{harvnb|Mote|1999|p=828}}.</ref> He had to repeal this command three weeks later after several peasant rebellions erupted around Beijing, threatening Qing control over the capital region.<ref>{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985}}, pp. 420<U+2013>22 (which explains these matters and claims that the order was repealed by edict on 25 June). {{harvnb|Gong|2010|p=84}} gives the date as 28 June.</ref>

Dorgon greeted Shunzhi at the gates of Beijing on 19 October 1644.<ref>{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|p=857}}.</ref> On 30 October the six-year-old monarch performed sacrifices to Heaven and Earth at the [[Altar of Heaven]].<ref>{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|p=858}}.</ref> A formal ritual of enthronement for Fulin was held on 8 November, during which the young emperor compared Dorgon's achievements to those of the [[Duke of Zhou]], a revered regent from antiquity.<ref>{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985}}, pp. 858 and 860 ("According to the emperor's speechwriter, who was probably Fan Wencheng, Dorgon even 'surpassed' (''guo'') the revered Duke of Zhou because 'The Uncle Prince also led the Grand Army through Shanhai Pass to smash two hundred thousand bandit soldiers, and then proceeded to take Yanjing, pacifying the Central Xia. He invited Us to come to the capital and received Us as a great guest'.").</ref> During the ceremony, Dorgon's official title was raised from "Prince Regent" to "Uncle Prince Regent" (''Shufu shezheng wang'' <U+53D4><U+7236><U+651D><U+653F><U+738B>), in which the Manchu term for "Uncle" (''ecike'') represented a rank higher than that of imperial prince.<ref>{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985}}, pp. 860<U+2013>61, and p. 861, note 31.</ref> Three days later Dorgon's co-regent Jirgalang was demoted from "Prince Regent" to "Assistant Uncle Prince Regent" (''Fu zheng shuwang'' <U+8F14><U+653F><U+53D4><U+738B>).<ref name="Wakeman 1985 861">{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|p=861}}.</ref> In June 1645, Dorgon eventually decreed that all official documents should refer to him as "Imperial Uncle Prince Regent" (''Huang shufu shezheng wang'' <U+7687><U+53D4><U+7236><U+651D><U+653F><U+738B>), which left him one step short of claiming the throne for himself.<ref name="Wakeman 1985 861"/>

One of Dorgon's first orders in the new Qing capital was to vacate the entire northern part of Beijing to give it to [[Eight Banners|Bannermen]]. The Yellow Banners were given the place of honor north of the palace, followed by the White Banners east, the Red Banners west, and the Blue Banners south.<ref>See maps in {{harvnb|Naquin|2000|p=356}} and {{Harvnb|Elliott|2001}}, p.

In 1646, Dorgon also ordered that the [[imperial examination|civil examinations]] for selecting government officials be reestablished. From then on they were held regularly every three years as under the Ming. In the very first palace examination held under Qing rule in 1646, candidates, most of whom were northern Chinese, were asked how the Manchus and [[Han Chinese]] could be made to work together for a common purpose.<ref>{{harvnb|Elman|2002|p=389}}.</ref> The 1649 examination inquired about "how Manchus and Han Chinese could be unified so that their hearts were the same and they worked together without division."<ref>Cited in {{harvnb|Elman|2002|pp=389<U+2013>90}}.</ref> Under the Shunzhi reign the average number of graduates per session of the metropolitan examination was the highest of the Qing dynasty ("to win more Chinese support"), until 1660 when lower quotas were established.<ref>{{harvnb|Man-Cheong|2004|p=7}}, Table 1.1 (number of graduates per session under each Qing reign); {{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|p=954}} (reason for the high quotas); {{harvnb|Elman|2001|p=169}} (lower quotas in 1660).</ref>

From newly captured Xi'an, in early April 1645 the Qing mounted a campaign against the rich commercial and agricultural region of [[Jiangnan]] south of the lower [[Yangtze River]], where in June 1644 [[Prince of Fu|a Ming imperial prince]] had established a regime loyal to the Ming.<ref>Dorgon's brother Dodo received the command to lead this "southern expedition" (''nan zheng'' <U+5357><U+5F81>) on April 1 ({{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|p=521}}).

==Transition and personal rule (1651<U+2013>1661)==

===Purging Dorgon's clique===

Dorgon's unexpected death on 31 December 1650 during a [[hunting]] trip triggered a period of fierce factional struggles and opened the way for deep political reforms.<ref>{{harvnb|Oxnam|1975|p=47}} ("intense factional rivalry," "among the fiercest and most complex of the early Ch'ing"); {{harvnb|Wakeman|1985}}, pp. 892<U+2013>93 (date and cause of Dorgon's death) and 907 (second "great wave of Qing institutional reform" from 1652 to 1655).</ref> Because Dorgon's supporters were still influential at court, Dorgon was given an imperial funeral and was posthumously elevated to imperial status as the "Righteous Emperor" (''yi huangdi'' <U+7FA9><U+7687><U+5E1D>).<ref>{{harvnb|Oxnam|1975|pp=47<U+2013>48}}.</ref> On the same day of mid-January 1651, however, several officers of the White Banners led by former Dorgon supporter Ubai arrested Dorgon's brother [[Ajige]] for fear he would proclaim himself as the new regent; Ubai and his officers then named themselves presidents of several Ministries and prepared to take charge of the government.<ref>{{harvnb|Oxnam|1975|p=47}}.</ref>

Meanwhile [[Jirgalang]], who had been stripped of his title of regent in 1647, gathered support among Banner officers who had been disgruntled during Dorgon's rule.<ref name="Oxnam 48">{{harvnb|Oxnam|1975|p=48}}.</ref> In order to consolidate support for the emperor in the two Yellow Banners (which had belonged to the Qing monarch since Hong Taiji) and to gain followers in Dorgon's Plain White Banner, Jirgalang named them the "Upper Three Banners" (''shang san qi'' <U+4E0A><U+4E09><U+65D7>; Manchu: ''dergi ilan g<U+016B>sa''), which from then on were owned and controlled by the emperor.<ref>{{harvnb|Elliott|2001|p=79}} (Manchu name; "personal property of the emperor"); {{harvnb|Oxnam|1975|p=48}} (timing and purpose of Jirgalang's move).</ref> [[Oboi]] and [[Suksaha]], who would become regents for the [[Kangxi Emperor]] in 1661, were among the Banner officers who gave Jirgalang their support, and Jirgalang appointed them to the [[Council of Deliberative Princes]] to reward them.<ref name="Oxnam 48"/>

On 1 February, Jirgalang announced that Shunzhi, who was about to turn thirteen, would now assume full imperial authority.<ref name="Oxnam 48"/> The regency was thus officially abolished. Jirgalang then moved to the attack. In late February or early March 1651 he accused Dorgon of usurping imperial prerogatives: Dorgon was found guilty and all his posthumous honors were removed.<ref name="Oxnam 48"/> Jirgalang continued to purge former members of Dorgon's clique and to bestow high ranks and nobility titles upon a growing number of followers in the Three Imperial Banners, so that by 1652 all of Dorgon's former supporters had been either killed or effectively removed from government.<ref>{{harvnb|Oxnam|1975|p=49}}.</ref>

===Factional politics and the fight against corruption===

On 7 April 1651, barely two months after he seized the reins of government, Shunzhi issued an edict announcing that he would purge corruption from officialdom.<ref>{{harvnb|Dennerline|2002|p=106}}.</ref> This edict triggered factional conflicts among literati that would frustrate him until his death.<ref>{{harvnb|Dennerline|2002|p=107}}.</ref> One of his first gestures was to dismiss grand academician [[Feng Quan]] (<U+99AE><U+9293>; 1595<U+2013>1672), a northern Chinese who had been impeached in 1645 but was allowed to remain in his post by Prince Regent Dorgon.<ref>{{harvnb|Dennerline|2002|p=106}} (dismissal of Feng Quan in 1651); {{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|pp=865<U+2013>72}} (for the story of the failed purge of Feng Quan in 1645).</ref> Shunzhi replaced Feng with [[Chen Mingxia]] (<U+9673><U+540D><U+590F>; ca. 1601<U+2013>1654), an influential southern Chinese with good connections in Jiangnan literary societies.<ref>{{harvnb|Dennerline|2002|p=107}} ("coalition of literary societies"); {{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|p=865}}.</ref> Though later in 1651 Chen was also dismissed on charges of influence peddling, he was reinstated in his post in 1653 and soon became a close personal advisor to the sovereign.<ref>{{harvnb|Dennerline|2002|pp=108<U+2013>9}}.</ref> He was even allowed to draft imperial edicts just like Ming [[Grand Secretariat|Grand Secretaries]] used to.<ref>{{harvnb|Dennerline|2002|p=109}}.</ref> Still in 1653, Shunzhi decided to recall the disgraced Feng Quan, but instead of balancing the influence of northern and southern Chinese officials at court as the emperor had intended, Feng Quan's return only intensified factional strife.<ref>{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|p=958}}.</ref> In several controversies at court in 1653 and 1654, the southerners formed one bloc opposed to the northerners and the Manchus.<ref>{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|pp=959<U+2013>74}} (discussion of these cases).</ref> In April 1654, when Chen Mingxia spoke to northern official [[Ning Wanwo]] (<U+5BE7><U+5B8C><U+6211>; d. 1665) about restoring the style of dress of the Ming court, Ning immediately denounced Chen to the emperor and accused him of various crimes including bribe-taking, [[nepotism]], factionalism, and usurping imperial prerogatives.<ref>{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985}}, pp. 976 (April 1654, Ning Wanwo) and 977<U+2013>81 (long discussion of Chen Mingxia's "crimes").</ref> Chen was executed by strangulation on 27 April 1654.<ref>{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|pp=985<U+2013>86}}.</ref>

In November 1657, a major cheating scandal erupted during the Shuntian provincial-level [[imperial examination|examinations]] in Beijing.<ref>{{harvnb|Gong|2010|p=295}} gives the date as 30 November 1657.</ref> Eight candidates from Jiangnan who were also relatives of Beijing officials had bribed examiners in the hope of being ranked higher in the contest.<ref>{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|p=1004}}, note 38.</ref> Seven examination supervisors found guilty of receiving bribes were executed, and several hundred people were sentenced to punishments ranging from demotion to exile and confiscation of property.<ref>{{harvnb|Ho|1962|pp=191<U+2013>92}}.</ref> The scandal, which soon spread to Nanjing examination circles, uncovered the corruption and influence-peddling that was rife in the bureaucracy, and that many moralistic officials from the north attributed to the existence of southern literary clubs and to the decline of classical scholarship.<ref>{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|pp=1004<U+2013>5}}.</ref>

===Chinese style of rule===
During his short reign, the Shunzhi emperor encouraged Han Chinese to participate in government activities and revived many Chinese-style institutions that had been either abolished or marginalized during Dorgon's regency. He discussed history, [[Chinese classics|classics]], and politics with grand academicians like Chen Mingxia (see previous section) and surrounded himself with new men such as [[Wang Xi (Qing-dynasty official)|Wang Xi]] (<U+738B><U+7199>; 1628<U+2013>1703), a young northern Chinese who was fluent in Manchu.<ref>{{harvnb|Dennerline|2002}}, pp. 109 (topics of discussions with Chen Mingxia) and 112 (on Wang Xi).</ref> The "Six Edicts" (''Liu yu'' <U+516D><U+8AED>) that Shunzhi promulgated in 1652 were the predecessors to Kangxi's "[[Sacred Edicts]]" (''Shengyu'' <U+8056><U+8AED>, 1670): "bare bones of [[Confucianism|Confucian]] orthodoxy" that instructed the population to behave in a [[filial piety|filial]] and law-abiding fashion.<ref>{{harvnb|Mair|1985|p=326}} ("bare bones"); {{harvnb|Oxnam|1975|pp=115<U+2013>16}}.</ref> In another move toward Chinese-style government, the sovereign reestablished the [[Hanlin Academy]] and the [[Grand Secretariat]] in 1658. These two institutions based on Ming models further eroded the power of the Manchu elite and threatened to revive the extremes of literati politics that had plagued the late Ming, when factions coalesced around rival grand secretaries.<ref>{{harvnb|Dennerline|2002|p=113}}.</ref>

To counteract the power of the [[Imperial Household Department]] and the Manchu nobility, in July 1653 Shunzhi established the Thirteen Offices (<U+5341><U+4E09><U+8859><U+9580>), or Thirteen Eunuch Bureaus, which were supervised by Manchus, but manned by Chinese [[Eunuch#China|eunuchs]] rather than Manchu [[Booi Aha|bondservants]].<ref>{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|p=931}} ("Thirteen Offices"); {{harvnb|Rawski|1998|p=163}} ("Thirteen Eunuch Bureaus," supervised by Manchus).</ref> Eunuchs had been kept under tight control during Dorgon's regency, but the young emperor used them to counter the influence of other power centers like his mother [[Empress Dowager Xiaozhuang|the Empress Dowager]] and former regent Jirgalang.<ref>{{harvnb|Dennerline|2002|p=113}}; {{harvnb|Oxnam|1975|pp=52<U+2013>53}}.</ref> By the late 1650s eunuch power became formidable again: they handled key financial and political matters, offered advice on official appointments, and even composed edicts.<ref>{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|p=931}} (composed edicts); {{harvnb|Oxnam|1975|p=52}}.</ref> Because eunuchs isolated the monarch from the bureaucracy, Manchu and Chinese officials feared a return to the abuses of eunuch power that had plagued the late Ming.<ref>{{harvnb|Oxnam|1975|p=52}} (isolated emperor from his officials); {{harvnb|Kessler|1976|p=27}}.</ref> Despite the emperor's attempt to impose strictures on eunuch activities, Shunzhi's favorite eunuch [[Wu Liangfu]] (<U+5433><U+826F><U+8F14>; d. 1661), who had helped him defeat the Dorgon faction in the early 1650s, was caught in a corruption scandal in 1658.<ref>{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|p=1016}}; {{harvnb|Kessler|1976|p=27}}; {{harvnb|Oxnam|1975|p=54}}.</ref> The fact that Wu only received a reprimand for his accepting bribes did not reassure the Manchu elite, which saw eunuch power as a degradation of Manchu power.<ref>{{harvnb|Oxnam|1975|pp=52<U+2013>53}}.</ref> The Thirteen Offices would be eliminated (and Wu Liangfu executed) by Oboi and the other [[Four Regents of the Kangxi Emperor|regents of the Kangxi Emperor]] in March 1661 soon after Shunzhi's death.<ref>{{harvnb|Kessler|1976|p=27}}; {{harvnb|Rawski|1998|p=163}} (specific date).</ref>

Meanwhile north of the Manchu homeland, adventurers [[Vassili Poyarkov]] (1643<U+2013>1646) and [[Yerofei Khabarov]] (1649<U+2013>1653) had started to explore the [[Amur River]] valley for [[Tsardom of Russia|Tzarist Russia]].

===Continuous campaigns against the Southern Ming===

Though the Qing under Dorgon's leadership had successfully pushed the Southern Ming deep into southern China, Ming loyalism was not dead yet. In early August 1652, [[Li Dingguo]], who had served as general in Sichuan under bandit king [[Zhang Xianzhong]] (d. 1647) and was now protecting the [[Yongli Emperor]] of the Southern Ming, retook [[Guilin]] (Guangxi province) from the Qing.<ref name="Struve 1988 704">{{harvnb|Struve|1988|p=704}}.</ref> Within a month, most of the commanders who had been supporting the Qing in Guangxi reverted to the Ming side.<ref>{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|p=973}}, note 194.</ref> Despite occasionally successful military campaigns in [[Huguang]] and [[Guangdong]] in the next two years, Li failed to retake important cities.<ref name="Struve 1988 704"/> In 1653, the Qing court put [[Hong Chengchou]] in charge of retaking the southwest.<ref name="Dennerline 117">{{harvnb|Dennerline|2002|p=117}}.</ref> Headquartered in [[Changsha]] (in what is now Hunan province), he  patiently built up his forces; only in late 1658 did well-fed and well-supplied Qing troops mount a multipronged campaign to take Guizhou and Yunnan.<ref name="Dennerline 117"/> In late January 1659, a Qing army led by Manchu prince Doni took the capital of Yunnan, sending the Yongli Emperor fleeing into nearby [[Burma]], which was then ruled by King [[Pindale Min]] of the [[Toungoo dynasty]].<ref name="Dennerline 117"/> The last sovereign of the Southern Ming stayed there until 1662, when he was captured and executed by Wu Sangui, the former Ming general whose surrender to the Manchus in April 1644 had allowed Dorgon to start the [[Qing conquest of China]].<ref>{{harvnb|Struve|1988|p=710}}.</ref>

[[Zheng Chenggong]] ("Koxinga"), who had been adopted by the Longwu Emperor in 1646 and ennobled by Yongli in 1655, also continued to defend the cause of the Southern Ming.<ref>{{harvnb|Spence|2002|p=136}}.</ref> In 1659, just as Shunzhi was preparing to hold a special examination to celebrate the glories of his reign and the success of the southwestern campaigns, Zheng sailed up the Yangtze River with a well-armed fleet, took several cities from Qing hands, and went so far as to threaten [[Nanjing]].<ref name="Dennerline 118"/> When the emperor heard of this sudden attack he is said to have slashed his throne with a sword in anger.<ref name="Dennerline 118"/> But the siege of Nanjing was relieved and Zheng Chenggong repelled, forcing Zheng to take refuge in the southeastern coastal province of Fujian.<ref>{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|pp=1048<U+2013>49}}.</ref> Pressured by Qing fleets, Zheng fled to Taiwan in April 1661 but died that same summer.<ref>{{harvnb|Spence|2002|pp=136<U+2013>37}}.</ref> His descendants resisted Qing rule until 1683, when the Kangxi Emperor successfully took the island.<ref>{{harvnb|Spence|2002|p=146}}.</ref>

After Fulin came to rule on his own in 1651, his mother the [[Empress Dowager Xiaozhuang]] arranged for him to marry her niece, but the young monarch [[Borjigit, Demoted Empress|deposed his new Empress]] in 1653.<ref name="Gates Fang 300">{{harvnb|Gates|Fang|1943|p=300}}.</ref> The following year Xiaozhuang arranged another imperial marriage with her [[Khorchin Mongols|Khorchin Mongol]] clan, this time matching her son with her own grand-niece.<ref name="Gates Fang 300"/> Though Fulin also disliked his second empress (known posthumously as [[Empress Xiaohuizhang]]), he was not allowed to demote her. She never bore him children.<ref>{{harvnb|Wu|1979|p=36}}.</ref> Starting in 1656, Shunzhi lavished his affection on [[Consort Donggo]], who, according to [[Jesuit]] accounts from the time, had first been the wife of another Manchu noble.<ref name="Wu 15-16">{{harvnb|Wu|1979|pp=15<U+2013>16}}.</ref> She gave birth to a son (Shunzhi's fourth) in November 1657. The emperor would have made him his heir apparent, but he died early in 1658 before he was given a name.<ref>{{harvnb|Wu|1979|p=16}}.</ref>

Shunzhi was an open-minded emperor and relied on the advice of [[Johann Adam Schall von Bell]], a [[Jesuit missions in China|Jesuit missionary]] from [[Cologne]] in the Germanic parts of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], for guidance on matters ranging from [[astronomy]] and technology to religion and government.<ref name="Spence 19">{{harvnb|Spence|1969|p=19}}.</ref> In late 1644, Dorgon had put Schall in charge of preparing a new calendar because his [[eclipse]] predictions had proven more reliable than those of the [[Chinese astronomy|official astronomer]].<ref>{{harvnb|Oxnam|1975|p=54}}; {{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|p=858}}, note 24.</ref> After Dorgon's death Schall developed a personal relationship with the young emperor, who called him "grand-father" (''mafa'' in Manchu).<ref>{{harvnb|Spence|1969|p=19}}; {{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|p=929}}, note 82.</ref> At the height of his influence in 1656 and 1657, Schall reports that Shunzhi often visited his house and talked to him late into the night.<ref name="Spence 19"/> He was excused from [[kowtow|prostrating himself]] in the presence of the emperor, was granted land to build a church in Beijing, and was even given imperial permission to adopt a son (because Fulin worried that Schall did not have an heir), but the Jesuits' hope of converting the Qing sovereign to Christianity was crushed when Shunzhi became a devout follower of [[Zen Buddhism|Chan Buddhism]] in 1657.<ref>{{harvnb|Spence|1969|p=19}} (list of privileges); {{harvnb|Fang|1943a|p=258}} (date of conversion to Buddhism).</ref>

The emperor developed a good command of Chinese that allowed him to manage matters of state and to appreciate Chinese arts like calligraphy and drama.<ref name="Zhou 12">{{harvnb|Zhou|2009|pages=12}}.</ref> One of his favorite texts was "Rhapsody of a Myriad Sorrows" (''Wan chou qu'' <U+842C><U+6101><U+66F2>), by [[Gui Zhuang]] (<U+6B78><U+838A>; 1613<U+2013>1673), who was a close friend of anti-Qing intellectuals [[Gu Yanwu]] and [[Wan Shouqi]] (<U+842C><U+58FD><U+797A>; 1603<U+2013>1652).<ref>{{harvnb|Wakeman|1984|p=631}}, note 2.</ref> "Quite passionate and attach[ing] great importance to ''qing'' (love)," he could also recite by heart long passages of the popular ''[[Romance of the Western Chamber]]''.<ref name="Zhou 12"/>

==Death and succession==
[[Image:Smallpox virus.jpg|alt=Grainy photograph of twelve slightly elongated round lumps clustered together.|left|thumb|230px|[[Transmission electron microscopy|Electron micrograph]] of the [[smallpox]] virus, against which the [[Manchu people|Manchus]] had no [[immunity (medical)|immunity]]. The Shunzhi emperor died of it, and his young successor [[Kangxi]] was chosen because he had already survived it.]]

===Smallpox===
In September 1660, [[Consort Donggo|Shunzhi's favourite consort]] suddenly died as a result of grief over the loss of a child.<ref name="Dennerline 118">{{harvnb|Dennerline|2002|p=118}}.</ref> Overwhelmed with grief, the emperor fell into dejection for months, until he contracted [[smallpox]] on 2 February 1661.<ref name="Dennerline 118"/> On 4 February 1661, officials Wang Xi (<U+738B><U+7199>, 1628<U+2013>1703; the emperor's [[confidant]]) and Margi (a Manchu) were called to the emperor's bedside to record his last will.<ref>{{harvnb|Oxnam|1975|p=205}}.</ref> On the same day, his seven-year-old third son [[Kangxi Emperor|Xuanye]] was chosen to be his successor, probably because he had already survived smallpox.<ref>{{harvnb|Spence|2002|p=125}}. Note that Xuanye was born in May 1654, and was therefore less than seven years old. Both {{harvnb|Spence|2002}} and {{harvnb|Oxnam|1975}} (p. 1) nonetheless claim that he was "seven years old." {{harvnb|Dennerline|2002}} (p. 119) and {{harvnb|Rawski|1998}} (p. 99) indicate that he was "not yet seven years old." In Chinese documents concerning the succession, Xuanye was said to be eight [[East_Asian_age_reckoning#Chinese|sui]] ({{harvnb|Oxnam|1975|p=62}}).</ref> The emperor died on 5 February 1661 in the Forbidden City at the age of twenty-two.<ref name="Dennerline 118"/>

The Manchus feared smallpox more than any other disease because they had no [[immunity (medical)|immunity]] to it and almost always died when they contracted it.<ref>{{harvnb|Perdue|2005|p=47}} ("Seventy to 80 percent of those infected died"); {{harvnb|Chang|2002|p=196}} (most feared disease among the Manchus).</ref> By 1622 at the latest, they had already established an agency to investigate smallpox cases and isolate sufferers to avoid [[Infectious disease|contagion]].<ref>{{harvnb|Chang|2002|p=180}}.</ref> During outbreaks, royal family members were routinely sent to "smallpox avoidance centers" (''bidousuo'' <U+907F><U+75D8><U+6240>) to protect themselves from infection.<ref name="Chang 181">{{harvnb|Chang|2002|p=181}}.</ref> The Shunzhi emperor was particularly fearful of the disease, because he was young and lived in a large city, near sources of contagion.<ref name="Chang 181"/> Indeed, during his reign at least nine outbreaks of smallpox were recorded in Beijing, each time forcing the emperor to move to a protected area like the "Southern Park" (Nanyuan <U+5357><U+82D1>), a hunting ground south of Beijing where Dorgon had built a "smallpox avoidance center" in the 1640s.<ref>{{harvnb|Naquin|2000|p=311}} (Southern Park used as hunting ground); {{harvnb|Chang|2002}}, pp. 181 (number of outbreaks) and 192 (Dorgon building a ''bidousuo'' in the Southern Park).</ref> Despite this and other precautions<U+2013><U+2013>such as rules forcing Chinese residents to move out of the city when they contracted smallpox<U+2013><U+2013>the young monarch still succumbed to that illness.<ref>{{harvnb|Naquin|2000|p=296}} (on rule forcing Chinese residents to move out).</ref>

The emperor's last will, which was made public on the evening of 5 February, appointed four regents for his young son: [[Oboi]], [[Sonin|Soni]], [[Suksaha]], and [[Ebilun]], who had all helped Jirgalang to purge the court of Dorgon's supporters after Dorgon's death on the last day of 1650.<ref>{{harvnb|Oxnam|1975}}, pp. 48 (on the four men helping Jirgalang), 50 (date of promulgation of the edict of succession), and 62 (on appointment of the four regents); {{harvnb|Kessler|1976|p=21}} (on helping to get rid of Dorgon's faction in the early 1650s).</ref> It is difficult to determine whether Shunzhi had really named these four Manchu nobles as regents, because they and Empress Dowager Xiaozhuang clearly tempered with the emperor's [[will (law)|testament]] before promulgating it.<ref>Historians agree that the Shunzhi will was either deeply modified or forged altogether. See for instance {{harvnb|Oxnam|1975}}, pp. 62<U+2013>63 and 205-7; {{harvnb|Kessler|1976|p=20}}; {{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|p=1015}}; {{harvnb|Dennerline|2002|p=119}}; and {{harvnb|Spence|2002|p=126}}.</ref> The emperor's will expressed his regret about his Chinese-style ruling (his reliance on eunuchs and his favoritism toward Chinese officials), his neglect of Manchu nobles and traditions, and his headstrong devotion to his consort rather than to his mother.<ref>{{harvnb|Oxnam|1975|p=52}}.</ref> Though the emperor had often issued self-deprecating edicts during his reign, the policies his will rejected had been central to his government since he had assumed personal rule in the early 1650s.<ref>{{harvnb|Oxnam|1975|p=51}} (on proclamations in which the emperor "publicly degraded himself") and 52 (on the centrality of these policies to Shunzhi's rule).</ref> The will as it was formulated gave "the mantle of imperial authority" to the four regents, and served to support their pro-Manchu policies during the period known as the [[Oboi regency]], which lasted from 1661 to 1669.<ref>{{harvnb|Oxnam|1975|p=63}}.</ref>

===After death===
Because court statements did not clearly announce the cause of the emperor's death, rumors soon started to circulate that he had not died but in fact retired to a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] monastery to live anonymously as a [[Bhikkhu|monk]], either out of grief for the death of his beloved consort, or because of a [[Coup d'<U+00E9>tat|coup]] by the Manchu nobles his will had named as regents.<ref>{{harvnb|Spence|2002|p=125}}.</ref> These rumors were not so incredible, because the emperor had become a fervent follower of [[Zen|Chan]] [[Buddhism in China|Buddhism]] in the late 1650s, even letting [[Bhikkhu|monks]] move into the imperial palace.<ref>{{harvnb|Fang|1943a|p=258}} (emperor became a devout Buddhist in 1657); {{harvnb|Dennerline|2002|p=118}} (emperor had become devoted to Buddhism "by 1659"; monks living in the palace).</ref> But much circumstantial evidence<U+2013><U+2013>including an account by one of these monks that the emperor's health greatly deteriorated in early February 1661 because of smallpox, and the fact that a concubine and an Imperial Bodyguard committed suicide to accompany the emperor in burial<U+2013><U+2013>suggests that Shunzhi's death was not staged.<ref>{{harvnb|Oxnam|1975|p=205}} (for monk's diary, citing an older study by Chinese historian [[Meng Sen]] <U+5B5F><U+68EE>); {{harvnb|Spence|2002|p=125}} (on the two suicides).</ref>

After being kept in the Forbidden City for 27 days of mourning, on 3 March 1661 the emperor's corpse was transported in a lavish procession to Jingshan <U+666F><U+5C71> (a hillock just north of the Forbidden City), after which a large amount of precious goods were burned as funeral offerings.<ref>{{harvnb|Standaert|2008|pp=73<U+2013>74}}.</ref> Only two years later, in 1653, was the body transported to its final resting place.<ref>{{harvnb|Standaert|2008|p=75}}.</ref> Contrary to Manchu customs at the time, which usually dictated that a deceased person should be cremated, the Shunzhi Emperor was buried.<ref>{{harvnb|Elliott|2001|p=477}}, note 122 (citing several studies and primary documents). By contrast, [[Hong Taiji]] and Shunzhi's two empresses had been cremated ({{harvnb|Elliott|2001|p=[http://books.google.com/books?id=_qtgoTIAiKUC&pg=PA1&dq=the+manchu+way#PRA1-PA264,M1 264]}}).</ref> He was interred in what later came to be known as the [[Eastern Qing Tombs]], 125 kilometers (75 miles) northeast of Beijing, one of two Qing imperial cemeteries.<ref name="Fang 258">{{harvnb|Fang|1943a|p=258}}.</ref> His tomb is part of the Xiaoling (<U+5B5D><U+9675>) [[mausoleum]] complex (known in [[Manchu language|Manchu]] as the Hiyoo<U+0161>ungga Munggan), which was the first mausoleum to be erected on that site.<ref name="Fang 258"/>
