She entered the top 10 of the [[WTA Rankings]] with the win.

By doing so, she became the sixth woman in the [[Open Era]] to complete the [[Grand Slam (tennis)#Career Grand Slam|career Grand Slam]] in singles. In the same year, she won an [[Olympic medal|Olympic silver medal]] in the [[London 2012 Olympics]].

Sharapova has been featured in a number of modeling assignments, including a feature in the ''[[Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue]]''. She has been featured in many advertisements, including for Nike, Prince, and Canon, and is the face of several [[fashion house]]s, most notably [[Cole Haan]]. Since February 2007, she has been a [[UNDP Goodwill Ambassador|United Nations Development Programme Goodwill Ambassador]], concerned specifically with the [[Chernobyl Recovery and Development Programme]]. In June 2011, she was named one of the "30 Legends of Women's Tennis: Past, Present and Future" by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'',<ref>{{cite news|title=30 Legends of Women's Tennis: Past, Present and Future <U+2013> Maria Sharapova|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2079150_2079148_2079118,00.html|work=[[Time Magazine|Time]]|accessdate=August 19, 2011|author=William Lee Adams|date=June 22, 2011}}</ref> and in March 2012 was named one of the "[[100 Greatest of All Time]]" by [[Tennis Channel]].

==Early life==
Maria Sharapova was born on April 19, 1987 in [[Nyagan]], Soviet Union. Her parents, Yuri and Elena, are from [[Gomel]], [[Belarus]]. Concerned about the regional effects of the 1986 [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl nuclear accident]], they left their homeland shortly before Sharapova was born.<ref name="ITH_2007_08_13">{{cite web|url=http://lenta.ru/lib/14164248/|publisher=[[Lenta.ru]]|title=<U+0428><U+0430><U+0440><U+0430><U+043F><U+043E><U+0432><U+0430>, <U+041C><U+0430><U+0440><U+0438><U+044F>|trans_title=Sharapova, Maria|language=Russian|accessdate=April 29, 2013}}</ref> When Sharapova was two, the family moved to [[Sochi]]. There her father befriended Aleksandr Kafelnikov, whose son [[Yevgeny Kafelnikov|Yevgeny]] would go on to win two Grand Slam singles titles and become Russia's first world no. 1 ranked tennis player. Aleksandr gave Sharapova her first tennis racquet at the age of four, whereupon she began practicing regularly with her father at a local park.<ref name="times">{{cite news|author=Paul Kimmage|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/tennis/article3177376.ece|title=The Big Interview: Maria Sharapova|work=[[The Times]]|date=January 13, 2008|accessdate=July 23, 2008|location=London}}</ref> She took her first tennis lessons with veteran Russian coach Yuri Yutkin, who was instantly impressed when he saw her play, noting her "exceptional [[hand-eye coordination]]."<ref name="Article">{{cite web|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-11732071-masha-was-a-star-at-four.do|author=Will Stewart|work=London Evening Standard|location=UK|title='Masha' was a star at four|date=July 2, 2004|accessdate=June 12, 2010}}</ref>

At the age of six, Sharapova attended a tennis clinic in Moscow run by [[Martina Navratilova]], who recommended professional training at the [[Nick Bollettieri|Nick Bollettieri Tennis Academy]] in Florida, which had previously trained players such as [[Andre Agassi]], [[Monica Seles]], and [[Anna Kournikova]].<ref name="times"/> With money tight, Yuri borrowed the sum that would enable him and his daughter, neither of whom could speak English, to travel to the United States, which they finally did in 1994.<ref name="Article" /> Visa restrictions prevented Sharapova's mother from joining them for two years.<ref name="ITH_2007_08_13"/> Arriving in Florida with savings of US$700,<ref name="Article" /> Sharapova's father took various low-paying jobs, including dishwashing, to fund her lessons until she was old enough to be admitted to the academy. In 1995, she was signed by [[IMG (business)|IMG]], who agreed to pay the annual tuition fee of $35,000 for Sharapova to stay at the academy, allowing her to finally enroll at the age of 9.<ref name="times"/>

==Tennis career==

===Juniors and early career ===
Sharapova first hit the tennis scene in November 2000, when she won the Eddie Herr International Junior Tennis Championships in the girls' 16 division at the age of just 13.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eddieherr.com/PastChampions.htm|publisher=Eddie Herr Official Website|archiveurl=http://wayback.archive.org/web/20120725075033/http://www.eddieherr.com/PastChampions.htm|archivedate=July 25, 2012|title=Eddie Herr Past Champions|accessdate=June 12, 2010}}</ref> She was then given a special distinction, the Rising Star Award, which is awarded only to players of exceptional promise.<ref>{{cite web|archiveurl=http://wayback.archive.org/web/20120317171129/http://www.eddieherr.com/2009/PlayerPacket09.pdf|archivedate=March 17, 2012|url=http://www.eddieherr.com/2009/PlayerPacket09.pdf|publisher=Eddie Herr Official Website|title=Eddie Herr International Special Awards|accessdate=June 12, 2010}}</ref>  Sharapova made her professional debut in 2001 on her 14th birthday on April 19, and played her first WTA tournament at the [[Pacific Life Open]] in 2002, winning a match before losing to [[Monica Seles]]. Due to restrictions on how many professional events she could play, Sharapova went to hone her game in junior tournaments, where she reached the finals of the girls' singles events at the Australian Open and Wimbledon in 2002. She was the youngest girl ever to reach the final of the Australian Open junior championship at 14 years and 9 months.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/tennis/wimbledon/5567102/Wimbledon-2009-Maria-Sharapova-20-facts-you-didnt-know.html|title=Wimbledon 2009: Maria Sharapova <U+2013> 20 facts you didn't know|author=Nick Collins|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=June 24, 2009|accessdate=July 19, 2010}}</ref> 

Sharapova reached no. 6 in the [[International Tennis Federation|ITF]] junior world singles ranking on October 21, 2002. In all, she won three junior singles tournaments and was runner-up at five, including two junior Grand Slam events. Her win-loss record in junior competition was 47<U+2013>9.<ref>[http://www.itftennis.com/juniors/players/player/profile.aspx?playerid=100013223 ITF Tennis Player Profile], ITF Juniors</ref>

===2003: First tournament titles===
From 2003, Sharapova played a full season and made a rapid climb into the top 50 by the end of the year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sonyericssonwtatour.com/SEWTATour-Archive/Rankings_Stats/Singles_Numeric_2003.pdf|author=Liz Schroeder|publisher=WTA|title=WTA Tour Singles Ranking 2003|date=November 10, 2003|accessdate=June 12, 2010}}</ref> She made her debuts at both the [[2003 Australian Open|Australian Open]] and the [[2003 French Open|French Open]], but failed to win a match in either.

By the end of September, Sharapova had already captured her first WTA title at a smaller event, the [[Japan Open Tennis Championships]], before winning her second in her final tournament of the season, the [[Bell Challenge]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/tennis/2003-11-02-quebec_x.htm|title=Sharapova handed Bell Challenge title|work=[[USA Today]]  Co.|date=November 2, 2003|accessdate=May 12, 2013}}</ref> To cap off her first full season as a professional, she was awarded the WTA Newcomer of the Year honor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wtatennis.com/scontent/article/3010014/title/wta-awards|title=WTA Awards|accessdate=May 18, 2013}}</ref>

===2004: Winning Wimbledon===
Sharapova was defeated in the third round of the [[2004 Australian Open|Australian Open]] by seventh seed [[Anastasia Myskina]]. The highlight of the remainder of her spring hard-court season was a run to the semifinals at the [[Regions Morgan Keegan Championships and the Cellular South Cup]], where she ultimately lost to eventual champion [[Vera Zvonareva]].
[[File:Maria Sharapova at Wimbledon (2004).jpg|thumb|300px|Sharapova at Wimbledon]]

During the spring clay-court season, Sharapova entered the top 20 on the WTA world rankings as a result of reaching the third round of the [[Qatar Telecom German Open]] and the [[Internazionali BNL d'Italia]], both of which were Tier I events. At the latter event, she defeated a player ranked in the top 10 for the first time with a straight-sets win over world no.&nbsp;10 and [[2004 French Open <U+2013> Women's Singles|2004 French Open]] finalist [[Elena Dementieva]]. Later that clay-court season, she went on to make the quarterfinals of a Grand Slam for the first time at the [[2004 French Open|French Open]], losing there to [[Paola Su<U+00E1>rez]].

Sharapova won the third title of her career at the [[2004 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]] warm-up [[DFS Classic]], defeating [[Tatiana Golovin]] in the final. Seeded 13th and aged 17 at Wimbledon, she reached her first Grand Slam semifinal by defeating [[Ai Sugiyama]]. There, she defeated fifth seed and former champion [[Lindsay Davenport]]. In the final, Sharapova upset top seed and defending champion [[Serena Williams]] to win her first Grand Slam singles title, and become the third-youngest woman to win the Wimbledon title, behind only [[Lottie Dod]] and [[Martina Hingis]]. Sharapova also became the second Russian woman (after [[Anastasia Myskina]] had won the year's previous major at [[French Open|Roland Garros]]) to win a Grand Slam singles title. The victory was hailed by the media as "the most stunning upset in memory",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A25495-2004Jul3.html|title=Sharapova Wins Wimbledon After Improbable Journey|work=[[The Washington Post]]|author=Liz Clarke|date=April 7, 2004|accessdate=June 20, 2010}}</ref> with other writers commenting on her arrival as a serious challenger to the [[Williams sisters|Williams']] dominance at Wimbledon.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/sport/article-11722204-birth-of-a-superstar.do|title=Birth of a superstar|publisher=This Is London|author=Adrian Warner|date=February 7, 2004|accessdate=June 20, 2010}}</ref> She entered the top 10 in the rankings for the first time as a result of the win.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/tennis/news/story?id=1834581|title=Sharapova vaults into top 10|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=July 6, 2004|accessdate=May 19, 2013}}</ref>

Following her Wimbledon win, attention and interest in Sharapova in the media greatly increased, a rise in popularity dubbed as "Maria Mania."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2004/08/27/commentary/column_sportsbiz/sportsbiz/index.htm|title=Maria Mania: no stopping her now|publisher=CNN|author=Chris Isidore|date=August 30, 2004|accessdate=June 20, 2010}}</ref> She won three of six matches in her preparations for the [[2004 US Open (tennis)|US Open]]. At the US Open itself, she reached the third round, before being eliminated by [[Mary Pierce]]. In order to regain confidence, Sharapova played and won consecutive titles in Asia in the fall, the [[Hansol Korea Open Tennis Championships]] and the [[Japan Open Tennis Championships]].

In October, Sharapova defeated [[Venus Williams]] en route to making the final of a [[Tier I]] event for the first time at the [[Zurich Open]], losing in the final to [[Alicia Molik]]. She then made her debut at the year-ending [[WTA Tour Championships]]. There, she won two of her three round-robin matches (including a win over US Open champion [[Svetlana Kuznetsova]]) in order to advance to the semifinals, where she defeated Myskina. In the final, she defeated Serena Williams, after trailing 4<U+2013>0 in the final set.

===2005: World no.&nbsp;1===
[[File:Maria Sharapova Indian Wells 2005.jpg|thumb|left|Sharapova at [[Indian Wells Masters|Indian Wells]] in 2005]]
Sharapova started the year at the [[2005 Australian Open|Australian Open]], where she defeated fifth seed [[Svetlana Kuznetsova]] to reach the second Grand Slam semifinal of her career. Sharapova held match points in the third set of her semifinal match, before losing to eventual champion [[Serena Williams]]. In February, Sharapova won back-to-back tournaments, the [[Toray Pan Pacific Open]] and the [[Qatar Total Open]], allowing her to reach number 3 in the world rankings for the first time.

In the semifinals of the Tier I [[Pacific Life Open]], Sharapova was defeated by [[Lindsay Davenport]], the first time she had failed to win a game in a match.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tennis/4363185.stm|title=Sharapova humiliated by Davenport|publisher=BBC|date=March 18, 2005|accessdate=August 7, 2011}}</ref> She defeated former world no.&nbsp;1 players [[Justine Henin]] and [[Venus Williams]] to reach the final at the Tier I [[NASDAQ-100 Open]], where she lost to [[Kim Clijsters]].

Sharapova made the semifinals of a clay-court tournament for the first time at the [[Italian Open (tennis)|Italian Open]], where she lost to [[Patty Schnyder]]. Sharapova would have become world no.&nbsp;1 for the first time had she won the tournament.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tennis/4544729.stm|title=Sharapova edges nearer to summit|publisher=BBC|date=May 13, 2005|accessdate=August 7, 2011}}</ref> Sharapova then reached the quarterfinals of the [[2005 French Open|French Open]] for the second consecutive year, before losing to eventual champion Henin. On grass, Sharapova won her third title of the year when she successfully defended her title at the [[DFS Classic]], defeating [[Jelena Jankovi<U+0107>]] in the final. As the defending champion at [[2005 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]], Sharapova reached the semifinals without dropping a set and losing a service game just once, extending her winning streak on grass to 24 matches. However, she was then beaten by eventual champion [[Venus Williams]].

A back injury sustained by world no.&nbsp;1 Davenport at Wimbledon prevented her from playing tournaments during the summer hard-court season, which meant she could not earn new ranking points to replace those that were expiring from the previous year. Sharapova, although also injured for much of this time, had far fewer points to defend, and so she became the first Russian woman to hold the world no.&nbsp;1 ranking on August 22, 2005.<ref name="wtacareer">{{cite web|url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/qa-sharapovas-first-business-aims-for-the-sweet-spot/479274.html|title=Q&A: Sharapova's First Business Aims for the Sweet Spot|work=[[The Moscow Times]]|date=April 26, 2013|accessdate=May 4, 2013}}</ref> Her reign lasted only one week, however, as Davenport reclaimed the top ranking after winning the [[Pilot Pen Tennis]] tournament.<ref name="wtacareer"/>

As the top seed at the [[2005 US Open <U+2013> Women's Singles|US Open]], Sharapova lost in the semifinals to [[Kim Clijsters]], meaning she had lost to the eventual champion in every Grand Slam of the season. However, she once again leapfrogged Davenport to take the world no.&nbsp;1 ranking on September 12, 2005. She retained it for six weeks, but after playing few tournaments while injured, she again relinquished the ranking to Davenport.<ref name="wtacareer"/> To conclude the year, Sharapova failed to defend her title at the year-end [[Sony Ericsson Championships]] in Los Angeles, defeating Davenport in one of her round-robin matches, but ultimately losing in the semifinals to eventual champion [[Am<U+00E9>lie Mauresmo]].

===2006: US Open champion===
[[File:MariaSharapova.JPG|upright|thumb|Sharapova celebrating after winning the [[2006 US Open (tennis)|2006 US Open]]]]
Sharapova started 2006 by losing in the semifinals of the [[2006 Australian Open|Australian Open]] in three sets to Henin, also losing a rematch several weeks later at the [[Dubai Tennis Championships]], having defeated former world no.&nbsp;1 [[Martina Hingis]] and world no.&nbsp;3 [[Lindsay Davenport]] in earlier rounds of the tournament. Sharapova claimed her first title in nine months at the Tier I tournament in Indian Wells, defeating Hingis in the semifinals and [[Elena Dementieva]] in the final. She reached the final in [[2006 NASDAQ-100 Open <U+2013> Women's Singles|Miami]] before losing to Kuznetsova.

Missing the entire clay-court season with injury, Sharapova returned for the [[2006 French Open <U+2013> Women's Singles|French Open]]. There, after saving match points in defeating [[Mashona Washington]] in the first round, she was eliminated by [[Dinara Safina]] in the fourth round.

On grass, Sharapova was unsuccessful in her attempt to win in Birmingham for the third consecutive year, losing in the semifinals to [[Jamea Jackson]]. Despite that, she was among the title favorites at [[2006 Wimbledon|Wimbledon]], where the eventual champion Mauresmo ended up beating her in the semifinals.

Sharapova claimed her second title of the year at the Tier I [[Acura Classic]], defeating Clijsters for the first time in the final. As the third seed at the [[2006 US Open (tennis)|US Open]], Sharapova defeated top seed Mauresmo for the first time in the semifinals, and then followed up by beating second seed [[Justine Henin]] to win her second Grand Slam singles title.

That autumn, Sharapova won titles in back-to-back weeks at the [[Zurich Open]] and the [[Generali Ladies Linz]]. By winning all three of her round-robin matches at the [[2006 WTA Tour Championships <U+2013> Singles|WTA Tour Championships]], she extended her win streak to 19 matches, before it was snapped in the semifinals by eventual champion Henin. Sharapova would have finished the season as world no.&nbsp;1 had she won the event. As it was, she finished ranked world no.&nbsp;2, her best year-end finish yet.

===2007: Shoulder injury and fall out of the top 5===
[[File:Maria Sharapova 2007 Australian Open.jpg|upright|thumb|left|Sharapova at the [[2007 Australian Open]]]]
Sharapova was the top seed at the [[2007 Australian Open <U+2013> Women's Singles|Australian Open]] due to top-ranked [[Justine Henin]]'s withdrawal. After being two points away from defeat in the first round against [[Camille Pin]], she went on to reach the final of the tournament for the first time, but was routed there by [[Serena Williams]] who was ranked world no.&nbsp;81 at the time. After reaching the final, Sharapova recaptured the world no.&nbsp;1 ranking.<ref name="wtacareer"/> She held it for seven weeks, surrendering it back to Henin after failing to defend her title at the [[Pacific Life Open]], instead losing in the fourth round to [[Vera Zvonareva]] after struggling with a hamstring injury. The following fortnight, she defeated [[Venus Williams]] in the third round of the [[Sony Ericsson Open]], before suffering another defeat to Serena Williams.

A shoulder injury forced Sharapova to miss most of the clay-court season for the second consecutive year, resulting in her only tune-up for the [[2007 French Open|French Open]] being the [[<U+0130>stanbul Cup]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/tennis/6689561.stm|title=Sharapova battles to Istanbul win|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=May 24, 2007|accessdate=May 22, 2013}}</ref> where she lost in the semifinals to [[Aravane Reza&iuml;]].

Sharapova entered the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]], where she was seeded third. She beat British [[Heather Watson]], and [[Anastasiya Yakimova]], to reach the third round.

Sharapova's next tournament was the [[2011 Toray Pan Pacific Open]] in Tokyo, Japan. As second seed, she received a bye into the second round, where she beat [[Tamarine Tanasugarn]]. She then beat 13th seed [[Julia G<U+00F6>rges]], before retiring against Petra Kvitov<U+00E1> in the quarterfinal, 3<U+2013>4, after slipping on the baseline, suffering an ankle injury. This also forced her to withdraw from the [[2011 China Open (tennis)|2011 China Open]] the following week. Sharapova then flew to Istanbul to prepare for the [[2011 WTA Tour Championships]], her first time qualifying since 2007. During the WTA Tour Championships, Sharapova withdrew during the round-robin stage after defeats against Samantha Stosur and [[Li Na (tennis)|Li Na]], as a result of the ankle injury she had suffered in Tokyo.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.rian.ru/sports/20110929/167244910.html|title=Ankle injury forces Sharapova to retire in Tokyo QF against Kvitova|publisher=[[RIA Novosti]]|date=September 29, 2011|accessdate=May 4, 2013}}</ref>

At the [[2012 BNP Paribas Open <U+2013> Women's Singles|Indian Wells]], after battling for over three hours, Sharapova defeated compatriot [[Maria Kirilenko]] to set up a semifinal meeting with [[Ana Ivanovic]]. Sharapova advanced to the final after Ivanovic retired due to a hip injury. In the final, she played world no.&nbsp;1 Victoria Azarenka in a rematch of the Australian Open final, but lost again in straight sets. Sharapova's next tournament was the [[2012 Sony Ericsson Open]], where she was seeded 2nd and received a bye. In the final, Sharapova lost in straight sets to 5th seeded [[Agnieszka Radwa<U+0144>ska]]. This was her third loss of the year in finals out of four tournaments played so far. In the [[2012 Porsche Tennis Grand Prix <U+2013> Singles|Porsche Tennis Grand Prix]] in Stuttgart, Sharapova was seeded second. She had a bye in the first round, and advanced to the third round after [[Aliz<U+00E9> Cornet]] retired in the second set. She won her first title of the year in Stuttgart after defeating world number one Victoria Azarenka. In doing so, Sharapova defeated three current Grand Slam title holders to win the tournament. Sharapova then played on the [[2012 Mutua Madrid Open]], a premier mandatory event. In the third round, Sharapova's opponent [[Lucie <U+0160>af<U+00E1><U+0159>ov<U+00E1>]] was unable to compete and withdrew from the tournament, earning Sharapova a walkover into the quarterfinals. She was then beaten by eventual champion [[Serena Williams]] in straight sets.

==Fed Cup participation==

Sharapova has lived in the United States since moving there at the age of seven, but retains her Russian citizenship, and is therefore eligible to play in the [[Fed Cup]] for Russia.<ref name="pravda">{{cite web|url=http://english.pravda.ru/society/stories/11-10-2005/9051-sharapova-0/|title=Maria Sharapova unwilling to trade her Russian citizenship for anything|publisher=[[Pravda]]|date=October 11, 2005|accessdate=May 4, 2013}}</ref> However, the behavior of Sharapova's father during her matches on the WTA Tour, combined with a perceived lack of commitment by her to the Fed Cup, has made her selection for the [[Russia Fed Cup team|Russian Fed Cup team]] cause controversy in the past.

After Sharapova had beaten fellow Russian [[Anastasia Myskina]] at the [[2004 WTA Tour Championships]], Myskina criticized Sharapova's father, saying: "He was just yelling and screaming instructions to her and I thought he just might jump right on the court at one point in the match." At the Fed Cup semifinals two weeks later, Myskina stated she would stop playing for Russia if Sharapova joined the Russian team the following season: "If she joins our team next season you won't see me there for sure. His behaviour is totally incorrect, simply rude. I don't want to be around people like him." [[Larisa Neiland]], assistant to Russia Fed Cup captain Shamil Tarpishchev, added: "Her father's behaviour (at the WTA Tour Championships) was simply outrageous. I just don't see how he could work with the rest of us." However Tarpishchev himself played down the problem, insisting: "I feel that things will calm down soon and we'll have Myskina, Sharapova, Kuznetsova and everyone else playing for Russia."<ref name="myskina">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tennis/4040243.stm|title=Myskina stands by Fed Cup threat|publisher=BBC|date=November 25, 2004|accessdate=May 4, 2013}}</ref>

==Playing style==
Sharapova is an aggressive baseliner, with power, depth, and angles on her forehand and backhand.<ref name="profile">Jeff Cooper.

===Serve===
[[File:Maria Sharapova at the 2009 Wimbledon Championships 12.jpg|thumb|Sharapova at The Championships, Wimbledon in 2009.]]
Early in her career Sharapova's first and second serves were regarded as powerful,<ref name="profile"/> and she was believed to possess one of the best deliveries on the Tour.<ref name="Serve1" /> Since the beginning of 2007, however, problems with her shoulder have reduced the effectiveness of her serve.<ref name="Serve1">{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/tennis/news/story?id=3046996|author=Joel Drucker|publisher=ESPN Tennis|title=Lingering injuries or limitations coming to light for Sharapova|date=October 3, 2007|accessdate=June 12, 2010}}</ref> The shoulder injury not only resulted in her inconsistent first serves, but also her hitting high numbers of double faults.<ref>[http://www.tennis.com/features/general/features.aspx?id=108430 "Bottom line for the top women, 2007"], Tennis.com. Retrieved July 23, 2008.</ref> Two-time US Open singles champion [[Tracy Austin]] believes that Sharapova often loses confidence in the rest of her game when she experiences problems with her serve and consequently produces more unforced errors and generally plays more tentatively,<ref name="austin">{{cite web|author=Tracy Austin|url=http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/25396610/|title=Austin: Sharapova loss a win for Venus and Serena|work=NBC Sports|date=June 27, 2008|accessdate=July 23, 2008}}</ref> while tennis writer Joel Drucker remarked that her serve was the "catalyst for her entire game", and that her struggles with it left her "unmasked."<ref name="Serve1" />

In her return from layoff in 2008 to 2009, she used an abbreviated motion, which was somewhat less powerful, and though producing aces also gave a very high number of double faults. After her early loss at the [[2009 US Open (tennis)|2009 US Open]], Sharapova returned to a more elongated motion, similar to her pre-surgery serve. She has since been able to produce speeds greater than before, including a 121&nbsp;mph serve hit at the Birmingham tournament in 2010 <U+2013> the fastest serve of her career.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/tennis/wimbledon/7841792/Wimbledon-2010-Maria-Sharapova-fighting-fit-at-last-and-ready-to-reclaim-her-SW19-crown.html|title=Wimbledon 2010: Maria Sharapova fighting fit at last and ready to reclaim her SW19 crown|author=Mark Hodgkinson|date=June 21, 2010|accessdate=June 21, 2010|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]}}</ref>

However since her shoulder operation Sharapova has been unable to control her serve. This has led to numerous faults, as she is unable to feel how much power she is generating.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/aug/09/sports/sp-la-women-tennis9|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|first=Diane|last=Pucin|title=Maria Sharapova can't control her serve|date=August 9, 2009}}</ref> The new action led to an elbow injury, but under Thomas H<U+00F6>gstedt it has improved but can still be erratic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.optimumtennis.net/maria-sharapova-serve.htm|title=Maria Sharapova Serve Analysis <U+2013> A Look Behind the Sharapova Serve Technique|publisher=Optimumtennis.net|accessdate=January 25, 2012}}</ref> This improvement in serving can be seen in the 2013 Australian Open and following tournaments where Maria Sharapova committed little double faults as compared to previous years.

===Surfaces===
Because she predicates her game on power, Sharapova's preferred surfaces are the fast-playing hard and grass courts, as evident through her 25 victories on hard court and grass court. This is most notable when she won the [[2004 Wimbledon]], [[2006 US Open (tennis)|2006 U.S. Open]] and [[2008 Australian Open]] crowns, where she had her career breakthrough and played her peak tennis level, respectively.

Sharapova, however, is not as well-suited to the slower clay courts as she is on hard and grass courts. Sharapova has admitted that she is not as comfortable with her movement on clay compared with other court surfaces and once described herself as like a "cow on ice" after a match on clay,<ref name="cow">Barry Flatman. [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/tennis/article1867693.ece Sharapova: a cow on ice?], ''The Times'', May 31, 2007. Retrieved July 23, 2008.</ref> due to her inability to slide. Despite this, she has shown improvement on this surface with respect to experience, as evident with her first WTA red clay title at the [[2010 Internationaux de Strasbourg]], 7 years since playing on the WTA circuit. Less than a year later, she won her biggest red clay title at the Tier I [[2011 Internazionali BNL d'Italia]]. Sharapova is still showing rapid improvement on clay courts as evident by winning the [[2012 Porsche Tennis Grand Prix]] in Stuttgart and then a month later successfully defending her 2011 title in Rome, by winning the [[2012 Internazionali BNL d'Italia]], and then winning the [[2012 French Open]], her best clay court season to date with a win/loss record of 19<U+2013>1, with a total loss of four sets the entire clay court season.

Sharapova stated "I'm sure when I was 17 years old and someone said, you'll be playing for another eight years, it would be like, you're not going to see me at a press conference at 25 years old. But years go on. I missed a year in my career<U+2014>I didn't play that year. I've said this, just before the tournament, a few weeks before, I woke up and I was just so happy to be going back on the court. I felt so fresh, full of energy, just with a really good perspective. Times change, obviously. I see myself playing this sport for many more years because it's something that gives me the most pleasure in my life. I think it helps when you know you're good at something, and you can always improve it.

The collection includes dresses that she designed for all the major tournaments, in collaboration with Nike and [[Cole Haan]].<ref name=cnn-ms>{{cite web| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/01/27/sport/tennis/tennis-sharapova-grand-slam-design/index.html | publisher=[[CNN]] | title=Grand slam designs: Maria Sharapova's fashion statement | date=January 27, 2012|accessdate=May 5, 2013|accessdate=2013-05-19}}</ref> She had previously found that the outfits given to her by Nike did not suit her frame and were worn by too many other players.<ref name=nytdress/> She comes up with design ideas and sketches in a process that begins 18 months before the event<ref name=cnn-ms/> and receives royalties from the sale of the collection, of which the corresponding dresses are coordinated to be available simultaneously with the corresponding major tournament.<ref name=nytdress/> The collection is worn by other WTA players, including [[Sofia Arvidsson]], [[Kai-Chen Chang]], [[Andrea Hlav<U+00E1><U+010D>kov<U+00E1>]], [[Madison Keys]], [[Anastasia Pivovarova]] as well as junior players such as Indy De Vroome.<ref name=cnn-ms/> Sharapova had earlier collaborated with Nike on the "little black dress" that she wore for her night matches at the 2006 US Open.<ref name=nytdress/> The dress featured a round crystal studded collar and was inspired by [[Audrey Hepburn]].<ref name=nytdress>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/26/fashion/maria-sharapovas-campaign-to-establish-herself-as-a-brand.html?pagewanted=all | work=[[The New York Times]] | first=Eric | last=Wilson | title=Maria Sharapova's Campaign to Establish Herself as a Brand | date=May 25, 2011|accessdate=May 5, 2013}}</ref> The dress was well publicized and received but was not mass-produced.<ref name=nytdress/><ref name=cnn-ms/><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/sectionfront/life/sharapovas-little-black-dress-provokes-a-big-racket-at-us-open-448646/ | work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] | first=MacKenzie | last=Carpenter | title=Sharapova's little black dress provokes a big racket at U.S. Open | date=September 1, 2006|accessdate=May 5, 2013}}</ref> Additionally, she designs shoes and handbags for Cole Haan, for which her signature ballerina flats are one of the biggest sellers of the entire brand.<ref name=nytdress/>

Sharapova used the Prince Triple Threat Hornet for part of 2003 and then used several different Prince racquets until the [[2004 US Open (tennis)|US Open]]. She gave the racquet she used in the [[2004 Wimbledon]] final to [[Regis Philbin]] when taping ''[[Live with Regis and Kelly]]''.
