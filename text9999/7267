'''Good Samaritan laws (acts)''' in the [[United States]] are [[law]]s/acts protecting from liability those who choose to aid others who are injured or ill. They are intended to reduce bystanders' hesitation to assist, for fear of being sued or prosecuted for unintentional injury or [[wrongful death claim|wrongful death]].  Similarly, in [[Canada]], a Good Samaritan [[doctrine]] is a [[legal principle]] that prevents a rescuer who has voluntarily helped a victim in distress from being successfully sued for 'wrongdoing.' Its purpose is to keep people from being so reluctant to help a stranger in need for fear of legal repercussions if they made some mistake in treatment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.canadianlawsite.ca/goodsamaritan.htm|title=Canadian Law website 1|accessdate=2008-10-16}}</ref> The principles contained in Good Samaritan laws more typically operate in countries in which the foundation of the legal system is [[English Common Law]], such as [[Australia]]<ref>{{cite journal|author=Gulam H, Devereaux J|title=A brief primer on Good Samaritan Law for health care professionals|journal=Aust Health Rev|issue=31|number=3|year=2007|pages=478-482|url=http://www.aushealthreview.com.au/publications/articles/issues/ahr_31_3_0807/ahr_31_3_478.asp}}</ref> In many countries which use [[civil law]] as the foundation for their legal systems, the same legal effect is more typically achieved using a principle of [[duty to rescue]].

==In the United States==
The details of Good Samaritan laws/acts in various jurisdictions vary, including who is protected from liability and in what circumstances.<ref>The laws include: Maryland Courts and Judicial Proceedings Code <U+00A7> 5-603; Virginia Code <U+00A7> 8.01-225.</ref> Not all jurisdictions provide protection to laypersons, in those cases only protecting trained personnel such as doctors or nurses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medi-smart.com/gslaw.htm|title=Good Samaritan Statutes (Medi-smart website)|accessdate=2008-10-17}}</ref> In some cases, laypersons are only protected when rendering aid in narrow circumstances, such as during a declared public health emergency. 

===General guidelines===
#In some jurisdictions, unless a caretaker relationship (such as a parent-child or doctor-patient relationship) exists prior to the illness or injury, or the "Good Samaritan" is responsible for the existence of the illness or injury, no person is required to give aid of any sort to a victim.   Good Samaritan statutes in the states of Minnesota and Vermont do include a duty to assist subdivision requiring a person at the scene of an emergency to provide reasonable assistance to a person in need.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cprinstructor.com/VT-GS.htm|title=Vermont Good Samaritan Law|accessdate=2008-10-17}}</ref> This assistance may be to call 9-1-1. Violation of the duty to assist subdivision is a petty misdemeanor in Minnesota and may warrant a fine of up to $100 in Vermont. At least five other states including California and Nevada are considering duty to assist subdivisions of their Good Samaritan Statutes.
#Good Samaritan provisions are not universal in application.  The legal principle of '''imminent-peril''' may also apply.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.essortment.com/all/goodsamaritanl_redg.htm|title=What is the Good Samaritan Law? (essortment website)|accessdate=2008-10-16}}</ref>  In the absence of imminent peril, the actions of a rescuer may be perceived by the courts to be reckless, and not worthy of protection.  To illustrate, a motor vehicle collision occurs, there is no fire, no immediate life threat from injuries, and no danger of a second collision.  A 'Good Samaritan' elects to 'rescue' the victim from the wreckage, with a result of causing paralysis.  The court rules that Good Samaritan laws do not apply, because the victim was not in imminent peril, and as a result the actions of the rescuer were 'reckless' and unnecessary.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2007-03-23-samaritan-accident_N.htm|title=Good samaritan law may not apply (USA Today)|accessdate=2008-10-17}}</ref>
#Any [[first aid]] provided must not be in exchange for any reward or financial compensation. As a result, medical professionals are typically '''not''' protected by Good Samaritan laws when performing first aid in connection with their employment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?Cite=4.24.300|title=RCW 4.24.300 Immunity from liability for certain types of medical care (Washington State Legislature website)|accessdate=2008-10-17}}</ref> Certain states make specific provisions for those trained medical professionals acting as volunteers, and for members of volunteer rescue squads, acting without expectation of financial compensation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://home.mesastate.edu/~jerry/gmnc/Colorado%20Good%20Samaritan%20Law.htm|title=Colorado Good Samaritan Law|accessedate=2008-10-17}}</ref>
#If aid begins, the responder must not leave the scene until:
#*it is necessary to call for needed medical assistance.
#*somebody of equal or higher ability can take over.
#*continuing to give aid is unsafe (this can be as simple as a lack of adequate protection against potential diseases, such as [[vinyl]], [[latex]], or [[nitrile]] gloves to protect against blood-borne pathogens) <U+2014> a responder can '''never''' be forced to put himself or herself in danger to aid another person.
#The responder is not legally liable for the death, disfigurement or disability of the victim as long as the responder acted rationally, in good faith, and in accordance with his level of training.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Rolfsen ML |title=Medical care provided during a disaster should be immune from liability or criminal prosecution |journal=The Journal of the Louisiana State Medical Society : official organ of the Louisiana State Medical Society |volume=159 |issue=4 |pages=224<U+2013>5, 227<U+2013>9 |year=2007 |pmid=17987961 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

===Consent===
The responder must not commit [[assault]] by giving aid to a patient without consent of the patient (or of the patient's legal parent or guardian if the patient is under 18 years old).

====[[Implied consent]]====
Consent may be implied if the patient is unconscious, delusional, intoxicated, deemed mentally unfit to make decisions regarding their safety, or if the responder had a reasonable belief that this was as such; courts tend to be very forgiving in adjudicating this, under the [[legal fiction]] that "peril invites rescue" (as in the [[rescue doctrine]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.law.com/default2.asp?selected=904&bold=|title=Implied Consent (Lawdictionary.com website)|accessdate=2008-10-17}}</ref>

Consent may also be implied if the legal parent or guardian is not immediately reachable and the patient is not considered an adult.

====Parental consent====
If the victim is not an adult (warning: definitions vary), consent must come from the legal parent or guardian. However, if the legal parent or guardian is absent, unconscious, delusional or intoxicated, consent is implied (with the same caveat as above). A responder may not withhold life-saving treatment (CPR, the [[Heimlich#Heimlich_maneuver|Heimlich Maneuver]]) if the parent/guardian will not consent.  The parent/guardian is then considered neglecting, and treatment is implied.  Special circumstances may exist if [[child abuse]] is suspected.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Foltin GL, Lucky C, Portelli I, ''et al'' |title=Overcoming legal obstacles involving the voluntary care of children who are separated from their legal guardians during a disaster |journal=Pediatric emergency care |volume=24 |issue=6 |pages=392<U+2013>8 |year=2008 |month=June |pmid=18562886 |doi=10.1097/PEC.0b013e318178c05d |url=}}</ref>

====Laws for first aiders only====
In some jurisdictions, Good Samaritan laws only protect those that have completed basic first aid training and are certified by the [[American Heart Association]], [[American Red Cross]], [[St. John Ambulance]], [[American Safety and Health Institute]] or other health organization, provided that they have acted within the scope of their training.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cga.ct.gov/lrc/recommendations/GoodSamaritanFiremansRuleFinalRpt.htm|title=Good Samaritan/Fireman's Rule (Connecticut State Legislature website)|accessdate=2008-10-17}}</ref> In other jurisdictions, any rescuer is protected from liability, granted the responder acted rationally. If one is neither trained in first aid nor certified, and performs first aid incorrectly, one can still be held liable.

==In Canada==
In [[Canada]], Good Samaritan Acts are a [[provincial]] power. Here is a list of several of the provincial acts:

#[[Ontario]] - Good Samaritan Act, 2001 <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.search.e-laws.gov.on.ca/en/isysquery/d9dc707e-281a-473f-af21-6a407eb94c43/1/frame/?search=browseStatutes&context=|title=Good Samaritan Act, S.O., 2001 (Ontario E-laws website)|accessdate=2008-10-10}}</ref> 
#[[Alberta]] - Emergency Medical Aid Act <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.qp.gov.ab.ca/Documents/acts/E07.CFM|title=Emergency Medical Aid Act (Alberta Queen's Printer website|accessdate=2008-10-10}}</ref>
#[[British Columbia]] - Good Samaritan Act <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.qp.gov.bc.ca/statreg/stat/G/96172_01.htm|title=Good Samaritan Act [RSBC 1996] CHAPTER 172 (British Columbia Queen's Printer website)|accessdate=2008-10-10}}</ref>
#[[Nova Scotia]] - Volunteer Services Act<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.ns.ca/legislature/legc/statutes/volnteer.htm|title=Volunteer Services Act 'Good Samaritan' RSNS 1989 (amend. 1992) (Nova Scotia Legislature website)|accessdate=2008-10-10}}</ref> 

Only in [[Quebec law|Quebec]], a civil law jurisdiction, does a person have a general duty to respond if first-aid or medically certified.<ref name="cangoodsam">{{cite web | title=Good Samaritan Law from The Canadian Association of Food Banks | url=http://www.cafb-acba.ca/english/GetInvolved-GoodSamaritanLaw.html |accessdate=December 26 | accessyear=2005 }}</ref> In British Columbia persons have a duty to respond only where a child is endangered.

An example of a typical Canadian law is provided here, from Ontario's Good Samaritan Act, 2001, section 2:
<blockquote>
Protection from liability

2. (1) Despite the rules of common law, a person described in subsection (2) who voluntarily and without reasonable expectation of compensation or reward provides the services described in that subsection is not liable for damages that result from the person's [[negligence]] in acting or failing to act while providing the services, unless it is established that the damages were caused by the gross negligence of the person. 2001, c. 2, s. 2 (1).<ref name="ontgoodsam">{{cite web | title=Good Samaritan Act, 2001 <U+00A9>Queen's Printer for Ontario, 2005 | url=http://www.canlii.org/on/laws/sta/2001c.2/20051114/whole.html | accessdate=December 26 | accessyear=2005}}</ref>
</blockquote>

Paramedics in Ontario perform what is referred to as an Aid to Capacity Evaluation in the event that treatment and/or transport to a medical facility is refused. The evaluation also includes an indication to whom the assessment refers if not the patient (e.g.: parent, or substitute decision maker). The patient or substitute is requested to verbalize/communicate understanding of clinical situation, appreciation of applicable risks, ability to make an alternative plan for care and a responsible adult on scene. Any negative response to the above would indicate a requirement of consideration of incapacity and necessary intervention would occur. Finally, paramedics request a signature for refusal of service:  "I have been advised that I should have treatment and that treatment is available immediately, I refuse such treatment and transportation to hospital having been informed of the risks involved. I assume full responsibility arising out of such refusal."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.search.e-laws.gov.on.ca/en/isysquery/48e9e93b-2cb6-48f4-99a4-ce637e81aa2d/1/frame/?search=browseStatutes&context=|title=Ambulance Act O.Reg.257/00 - Ontario Ambulance Documentation Standards|accessdate=2008-10-10}}</ref>

==Confusion with duty to rescue==
Good Samaritan laws may be confused with the [[duty to rescue]], as described above. There are, in fact, variations between the U.S. and Canadian approach to this issue.  Under the common law, Good Samaritan laws provide a defence against torts over the activity of attempted rescue. Such laws do not constitute a [[duty to rescue]], such as exists in some civil law countries,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Higuchi N |title=[Good Samaritan Act and physicians' duty to rescue] |language=Japanese |journal=Nippon Hoshasen Gijutsu Gakkai zasshi |volume=64 |issue=3 |pages=382<U+2013>4 |year=2008 |month=March |pmid=18434681 |doi= |url=http://joi.jlc.jst.go.jp/JST.JSTAGE/jjrt/64.382?from=PubMed}}</ref> and in the common law under certain circumstances. However, the duty to rescue where it exists may itself imply a shield from liability; for example, under the [[German law]] of "Unterlassene Hilfeleistung" (neglect of duty to provide assistance), a citizen is obliged to provide first aid when necessary and is immune from prosecution if assistance given in good faith turns out to be harmful. In Canada, all provinces with the exception of Quebec operate on the basis of [[English Common Law]].  Quebec operates a civil law system, based in part on the [[Napoleonic Code]].  In that province the principle of duty to rescue does operate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.canadianlawsite.ca/goodsamaritan.htm|title=Canadian Law website 2|accessdate=2008-10-16}}</ref>

To illustrate a variation in the concept of duty to rescue, in the Canadian province of Ontario, the Occupational Health and Safety Act provides all workers with the right to refuse to perform unsafe work.  There are, however, specific exceptions to this right.  When the "life, health or safety of another person is at risk", then specific groups, including "police officers, firefighters, or employees of a hospital, clinic or other type of medical worker (including EMS)" are specifically excluded from the right to refuse unsafe work.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.search.e-laws.gov.on.ca/en/isysquery/1b20e47b-33e4-49e7-a525-b268f053d236/4/frame/?search=browseStatutes&context=|title=Occupational Health and Safety Act, R.S.O. (1990) (Ontario E-laws website)|accessdate=2008-10-10}}</ref>

===In popular culture===
A Good Samaritan law was featured in the May [[1998]] series finale of the popular [[NBC]] [[sitcom]] ''[[Seinfeld]]'', in which the show's four main characters were all prosecuted and sentenced to one year in jail for making fun of (rather than helping) an overweight man who was getting robbed at gunpoint. In reality, while [[Massachusetts]] (where the fictional crime was committed) does have a law requiring passers-by to report a crime in progress, the most stringent punishment the characters could have suffered under those circumstances would have been a $500-$2500 fine  (assuming they were prosecuted under state law); in addition, the phrase "Good Samaritan law," when used in Massachusetts, refers only to the civil law definition, and does not have any actual relevance to the law that Seinfeld and his friends were prosecuted for.<ref name="seinfeldgoodsam">{{cite web | title=Footnote TV's<U+00AE> Mirror Law<U+2122> analysis of the Seinfeld finale and Massachusetts' Good Samaritan Law| url=http://www.footnote.tv/mlseinfeld.html#goodsamaritan |accessmonthday=July 13 | accessyear=2006 }}</ref>

The fact that Good Samaritan Laws in most states do not include a citizen's duty to assist, was featured in an episode of the second season of the show ''[[Desperate Housewives]]''. Character Bree Van de Kamp is threatened by her son to be exposed for having stood by while a man she used to have an affair with committed suicide. She hires a lawyer who explains that she specifically was not under any requirement to assist this person.
