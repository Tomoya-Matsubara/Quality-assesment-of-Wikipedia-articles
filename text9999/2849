Before World War I, the '''Reformed Christian Church in Serbia''' was part of the [[Reformed Church in Hungary]]. In the period of the Reformation, Rev Szt<U+00E1>ray planted 120 Reformed congregations in the region.In the period of the Ottoman Empire regions of [[Hungary]] were part of the Empire. Villages were destroyed. After the t<U+00FC>rks was defeated, Hungarian Reformed people come frrom [[Debrecen]], [[Szentes]]. In 1898 a whole Catholic village converted to the [[Reformed]] faith, because of the Catholic church refused to celebrate the mass in [[Hungarian language]]. After World War I this part of Hungary was connected to [[Serbia]]. In 1933 the Reformed Church in Yugoslavia was founded. At that time among Hungarians, there were [[Germans|German]] Reformed comgregations, the Germans arrived in this region in the 18th century. After World War II the Germans forced to leave the country. There are Czech- speaking and a remnant German speaking congregations. The church suffered in the Communist regime. A number of congregations separated when Crotia become independent to form the [[Reformed Christian Church in Croatia]].<ref>http://www.szrke.com/index-tor.html</ref>

The church affirms the [[Apostles Creed]], [[Athanasian Creed]], [[Nicene Creed]], [[Heidelberg Catechism]], [[Second Helvetic Confession]], just like the official confessions of the Hungarian Reformed Church. The Reformed Hungarian speaking minority lives in predominantly in the northern part, especially in [[Vojvodina]].<ref>http://www.reformiert-online.net/adressen/detail.php?id=112176&lg=eng</ref>
