Schulte played football at the [[University of Michigan]] from 1903&ndash;1905 and later coached football and track and field at [[Eastern Michigan University]] (1906&ndash;1908), [[University of Missouri]] (1914&ndash;1917), and [[University of Nebraska<U+2013>Lincoln|University of Nebraska]] (1919&ndash;1938).  Schulte was often referred to by the nickname "Indian" Schulte,<ref name=Ind>{{cite news|title="Indian" Schulte Quits Track Post at Nebraska U.|newspaper=Wisconsin State Journal|date=1938-07-24}}</ref> though he was of German rather than Native American descent.<ref name=Side>{{cite news|author=Brian Bell|title=On the Sidelines|newspaper=Bradford Era|date=1931-06-17}}</ref>

==Biography==
===Football player===
Schulte was born in 1878 near [[St. Louis, Missouri]].  He played football at [[Smith Academy]] in St. Louis and then at [[Washington Bears football|Washington University in St. Louis]].<ref name=Obit2>{{cite news|title=untitled obituary for Henry "Pa" Schulte|newspaper=Emporia Gazette|date=1944-10-19}}</ref>  In 1903, Schulte transferred to the University of Michigan where he played at the [[Guard (American football)|guard]] and [[Center (American football)|center]] positions for [[Fielding Yost]]'s famous "Point-a-Minute" teams of [[1903 Michigan Wolverines football team|1903]], [[1904 Michigan Wolverines football team|1904]], and  [[1905 Michigan Wolverines football team|1905]] -- teams the compiled a record of 33&ndash;1&ndash;1 over the three years Schulte was a starter.  In late 1905 and early 1906, charges of professionalism were leveled at the major college football programs, including Michigan, leading to calls for reform or even elimination of the sport from college campuses.  In response to the controversy, the faculty at Michigan ruled Schulte and two other football players, [[Germany Schulz]] and [[Walter Rheinschild]], academically ineligible.  As a result, Schulte missed the 1906 season.<ref>{{cite news|title=Schulte Barred|publisher=Michigan Alumnus|date=April 1906|page=322|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=zIQqAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_v2_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q=&f=false}}</ref>

===Football and track coach===
In his senior year at Michigan, Schulte began a long career in coaching as the track coach at [[Michigan State University|Michigan State College]].<ref name=Ind/>  From 1906 to 1908, Schulte served as coach of the football, baseball and track teams at Eastern Michigan University.<ref name=Corn/><ref name=Ind/>  In three years as Eastern Michigan's football coach, Schulte compiled a 9&ndash;6&ndash;1 record.<ref name=Corn>{{cite web|title=Henry Schulte profile|publisher=University of Nebraska|url=http://www.huskers.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=100&ATCLID=920228}}</ref>

From 1909 to 1913, Schulte coached at Cape Girardeau College in Missouri.<ref>{{cite news|title=Former Nebraska Track Coach Dies|newspaper=Ada Evening News|date=1944-10-19}}</ref>  He was also an assistant coach to Fielding Yost for the [[1912 Michigan Wolverines football team]].<ref>{{cite web|title=1912 Football Team|publisher=University of Michigan, Bentley Historical Library|url=http://bentley.umich.edu/athdept/football/fbteam/1912fbt.htm}}</ref>

From 1914 to 1919, Schulte coached football and track and field at Missouri.<ref>{{cite news|title=Few Track Men at Missouri: Coach Henry Schulte Working With Small Nucleus|newspaper=Des Moines Daily News|date=1919-01-26}}</ref>  In three years as coach of the football team (1914&ndash;1917), he compiled a 16&ndash;14&ndash;2 record.<ref name=Corn/>  The track athletes he coached at Missouri included [[Jackson Scholz]] and [[Bob Simpson]].<ref name=Ind/>  A newspaper profile of Schulte in 1917 noted his contributions to the Missouri athletic program:<blockquote>"Missouri hardly can afford to let 'Indian' Schulte, the football and track coach, leave the athletic department of the university, Schulte has had splendid success at Missouri. He has turned out well coached football teams and highly successful track teams. He has given Missouri in a coaching way what C. L. Brewer has supplied in the way of careful management and the upbuilding of a fine athletic plant. Schulte, an impulsive, impetuous fellow, is beloved of his boys. He has done much for Missouri athletics. He is entitled to the best Missouri can give him."<ref>{{cite news|title=Inside Sport Dope|newspaper=Hutchinson News|date=1917-01-26}}</ref></blockquote>

From 1919 to 1920, he was the head football coach at Nebraska, where he compiled an 8&ndash;6&ndash;3 record. He also served as the school's track coach from 1919 to 1938, and was an assistant coach for the football team from 1922 to 1927.<ref name=Corn/><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://unlhistory.unl.edu/yearbooks/yrbk1923_images.php?page=414|title=1923 Cornhusker - University of Nebraska Yearbook (Page 414)|accessdate=2009-12-04|publisher=Nebraska U - A Collaborative History.}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Schulte Sets Pace As Nebraska Coach|newspaper=Des Moines Capital|date=1923-01-04}}</ref> One newspaper columnist noted that "his work with the big, sturdy plainsmen of the Cornhusker state largely was responsible for the name the school built for itself."<ref name=BB>{{Cite news|author=Brian Bell|title=On the Sidelines|newspaper=Sandusky Register|date=1932-11-20}}</ref>  Schulte was credited with building great football lines for Nebraska, evn in his years as an assistant coach; Notre Dame coach [[Knute Rockne]] frequently mentioned Schulte as "the greatest line coach in the game."<ref name=BB/>  In 20 years as the [[Nebraska Cornhuskers|Cornhuskers]]' track coach, Schulte coached his teams to 15 conference titles.<ref name=Corn/>  Schulte also served as a coach on the U.S. track team at the [[1928 Summer Olympics]].<ref name=Side/>  At Nebraska, the track athletes coached by Schulte included [[Ed Weir]], [[John Rhodes|John "Choppy" Rhodes]], [[Hugh Rhea]], [[Sam Francis]] and [[Lloyd Cardwell]].<ref name=Ind/>

In later years, Schulte served as an instructor at coaching schools.  In 1934, Schulte taught track coaching at a program in which [[Fritz Crisler]] also taught football coaching.  A newspaper story on the coaching school reflected the popularity of Schulte's classes:<blockquote>"Henry 'Indian' Schulte, University of Nebraska, concluded his track and field work yesterday, and was given a rousing send-off by the 200 or more coaches who have been attending his lectures. It was the opinion of numerous coaches yesterday that the Texas Tech coaching school authorities would do well to sign Schulte immediately for another course next year. ... One of the most popular lecturers to appear here, Schulte, who is getting along in years but younger in ideas and thought, has had almost as large a following as any football coach on the staff."<ref>{{cite news|title=Fritz Crisler To Conclude Gridiron Work Today; Henry Schulte Finishes Yesterday|newspaper=Morning Avalanche (Lubbock, Texas)|date=1934-08-04}}</ref></blockquote>

===Death and tributes===
In 1939, Schulte resigned as Nebraska's track coach due to illness.<ref name=Ind/>  After several years of illness, Schulte died at [[Lincoln, Nebraska]] in October 1944 at age 65.<ref name=Obit/>  In its obituary for Schulte, the [[Associated Press]] referred to Schulte as the "grand old man" of the University of Nebraska track teams.<ref name=Obit>{{cite news|title=Henry Schulte, Veteran Husker Coach, Dies|newspaper=Hutchinson News Herald|date=1944-10-19}}</ref> 

When Nebraska completed a new athletic field house in 1946, it was named Schulte Fieldhouse in his honor.  Schulte Fieldhouse was demolished to make room for the Tom and Nancy Osborne Athletic Complex, which was completed in 2006.<ref name=Corn/>
