'''KQED''' is a [[PBS]]-member station in [[San Francisco, California]], broadcasting on [[very high frequency|VHF]] channel 9. This channel is also carried on [[Comcast]] [[cable television|cable TV]] and via satellite by [[DirecTV]] and [[Dish Network]]. Its [[transmitter]] is located on [[Sutro Tower]] in San Francisco.

It is one of the most-watched PBS stations in the country during primetime.<ref>[http://www.kqed.org/about/ About KQED]</ref>

Noteworthy KQED television productions include the first installment of [[Armistead Maupin]]'s miniseries ''[[Tales of the City]]'', ''[[Tongues Untied]] by [[Marlon Riggs]]'', and a series of programs focusing on the historic [[neighborhoods in San Francisco, California|neighborhoods in San Francisco]], such as [[The Castro]] and The [[Fillmore District]]. Ongoing productions include ''[[Josh Kornbluth|The Josh Kornbluth Show]]'', ''[[California Connected]]'',  ''[[Check, Please!|Check, Please! Bay Area]]'', ''Spark'', ''This Week in Northern California'' and ''QUEST''<ref>[http://www.kqed.org/quest/about More information - KQED QUEST<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>.

==History==
KQED was organized and created by veteran [[journalist|broadcast journalists]] [[James Day (journalist)|James Day]] and [[Jonathan Rice]] [[June 1]], [[1953]] and first went on air [[April 5]], [[1954]]. It was the sixth [[public broadcasting]] station in the [[United States]], debuting shortly after [[WQED (TV)|WQED]] in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]]. The station's [[call letters]], ''[[Q.E.D.]]'', literally translated from the [[Latin]] phrase, ''quod erat demonstrandum'', meaning ''which was to be demonstrated.''

In its early days following sign-on, KQED broadcast only twice a week for one hour each day. Despite the very limited schedule, the station was still losing money, leading to a decision in early 1955 from its board of trustees to close down the station. Its staff got the board to keep the station on the air and try to get needed funds from the public in a form of a televised [[auction]], in which celebrities would appear to auction off goods and services donated to the station. While the station still came a little short, it did show that the general public cared to keep KQED on the air. Since then, the auction became a fund-raising tool for many public television stations, though its usage waned in recent years in favor of increased usage of special [[pledge drive]]s throughout the year.<ref> ''Tube of Plenty: The Evolution of American Television'', by Erik Barnouw; Oxford University Press, 1982</ref>

Channel 9 had a [[sister station]], [[KMTP-TV|KQEC]], which broadcast on Channel 32. KQED had inherited the station in 1970 (as KNEW-TV) from [[Metromedia]], but found they could not operate it without losing money. Various PBS and locally produced programs from KQED would air erratically and at different times of the day on KQEC. In 1988, the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) revoked KQED's license to operate KQEC, citing excessive off-air time, further charging dishonesty in previous filings with regard to the specific reasons. The alleged dishonesty was in reference to KQED's claim of financial woes for keeping KQEC off the air for most of 1972 through 1977, and again for several months in 1979 and 1980. After being revoked from KQED, the reassigned license was granted to the [[Minority Television Project]] (MTP), one of the challengers of the KQED/KQEC filing.<ref>{{cite news

==Controversies==
===''Televising executions''===
During the early 1990s, when the State of [[California]] reinstituted the [[death penalty]], the KQED organization waged a highly controversial legal battle for the right to televise the forthcoming [[Execution (legal)|execution]] of [[Robert Alton Harris]] at [[San Quentin]] State Prison.<ref>{{cite web

</ref> contemporary reports noted that a number of KQED's members (primarily [[families]] throughout the [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Area]]) dropped their financial support for the station, intending for their [[charitable contributions]] to KQED to support programs such as [[Sesame Street]] rather than legal fees.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

===''Tales of the City''===
KQED was co-producer of the television adaptation of [[Armistead Maupin]]'s novel, ''[[Tales of the City]]'', which aired on PBS stations nationwide in January 1994. The six-part miniseries stirred controversy over the gay themes, nudity and illicit drug use in this fictional portrayal of life in 1970s San Francisco. The controversy led to calls from the public to cancel the series, a bomb threat at [[WTCI]] in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]], which forced that station to pull the program an hour before airtime, and threats from state and federal governments to cut funding for the network and its stations. Although the program gave PBS its highest ratings ever for a dramatic program, the network decided to forgo participation in the production of an adaptation of the second book in the series, ''[[More Tales of the City (novel)|More Tales of the City]]''.

==Digital television==
'''KQED-DT''' is an [[ATSC]] [[digital television]] signal broadcast over channel 30 from Sutro Tower available over-the-air with a digital tuner, or through [[digital cable]] service from Comcast.<ref name=comcastlineup>{{cite web

* [[KTEH]] on DT9.2 (Comcast 10)
* [[PBS World|KQED World]] on DT9.3 (Comcast 190)

==KQET==
KQED's television programming is repeated in the [[Monterey, California|Monterey]]/[[Salinas, California|Salinas]]/[[Santa Cruz, California|Santa Cruz]] market on '''KQET''', analog channel 25 and digital channel 58, licensed to [[Watsonville, California|Watsonville]].

KQET was founded in 1989 as '''KCAH''', a locally-owned PBS member station that served the Monterey area. In the late 1990s, [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] PBS member station [[KTEH]] acquired KCAH, making it a satellite of KTEH.

KCAH changed its call letters to '''KQET''' on August 12, 2007, months after the merger of KQED and KTEH. On October 1, 2007, KQET switched programming sources from KTEH to KQED.<ref>{{cite web | title=KQET Fall 2007 Schedule | url= http://www.kteh.org/tv/kqetschedule.pdf | publisher=KQET | date=2007 | archivedate=20080317 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080317010601/http://www.kteh.org/tv/kqetschedule.pdf | format=PDF | accessdate=2009-01-25}}</ref>

KQET is scheduled to terminate its analog transmissions over UHF channel 25 on the morning of May 9, 2009. The station will move its digital signal from is pretransition UHF channel 58 to post transition UHF channel 25, its historic analog frequency.

==Publishing==
In 1955, KQED began publishing a programming guide called ''KQED in Focus''. The program guide began to add more articles and took on the character of a regular [[magazine]]. The name was later changed to ''Focus Magazine'' and then to ''San Francisco Focus''.<ref>[http://www.kqed.org/about/history/1950s.jsp "About KQED: The 1950s"], ''KQED.com''.</ref> In 1984, a new programming guide, ''Fine Tuning'' was separated off from ''Focus'', with ''Focus'' carrying on as a self-contained magazine.<ref>[http://www.kqed.org/about/history/1980s.jsp "About KQED: The 1980s"], ''KQED.com''.</ref> In the early 1990s, ''San Francisco Focus'' was the recipient of number of journalism and publishing awards, including a [[National Headliner Award]] for feature writing in 1993. In 1997, KQED sold ''San Francisco Focus'' to Diablo Publications in order to pay off debts.<ref>[http://www.kqed.org/about/history/1990s.jsp "About KQED: The 1990s"], ''KQED.com''.</ref> In 2005, ''San Francisco Focus'' was resold to Modern Luxury Media, who rebranded the magazine as ''[[San Francisco (magazine)|San Francisco]]''.<ref>[http://www.sanfran.com/files/pressroom/ModernLuxury_release1.pdf "''San Francisco'' magazine re-launches in a new format that redefines city and luxury magazine publishing"] (press release), Modern Luxury Media, [[October 18]], [[2005]].</ref>
