'''Mozilla Firefox''' is a graphical [[web browser]] developed by the [[Mozilla Corporation]] and a large community of external contributors.  Firefox, officially abbreviated as '''Fx''' or '''fx'''<ref>{{cite web | title = How do I spell Firefox? How do I abbreviate it? | url = http://www.mozilla.org/support/firefox/faq#spell-abbreviate | work = Firefox FAQ | publisher = Mozilla.org | accessdate = 2007-01-08}}</ref> and popularly abbreviated '''FF''',<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.abbreviations.com/b1.asp?KEY=394936 | title = FF | accessdate = 2007-02-23 | date = July 19, 2006 | work = Abbreviations.com | publisher = STANDS4 LLC}}</ref> started as a [[fork (software development)|fork]] of the Navigator browser component of the [[Mozilla Application Suite]].  Firefox has replaced the Mozilla Suite as the flagship product of the Mozilla project, under the direction of the [[Mozilla Foundation]].

Mozilla Firefox is a [[cross-platform]] browser, providing support for various versions of [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Mac OS X]], and [[Linux]]. However, the source code has been unofficially ported to other operating systems, including [[FreeBSD]],<ref name="Firefox - Port details">{{cite web | title = Firefox - Port details | publisher = Freshports.org | url = http://www.freshports.org/www/firefox/ | accessdate = 2007-01-24 }}</ref> [[OS/2]], [[Solaris Operating Environment|Solaris]], [[SkyOS]], [[BeOS]] and more recently, [[Windows XP Professional x64 Edition]].<ref name="Porting from ABI x86-64 assembler to Win64 x86-64 assembler">{{cite web | title = Porting from ABI x86-64 assembler to Win64 x86-64 assembler | publisher = Mozilla.com | date = [[December 22]] [[2006]] | url = http://www.mozilla-x86-64.com/archives/2006/12/porting_from_ab.html | accessdate = 2007-01-24 }}</ref>

Firefox's [[source code]] is freely available under the terms of the Mozilla [[tri-license]] as [[Alternative terms for free software|free and open source software]]. The current stable release of Firefox is version 2.0.0.3, released on [[March 20]], [[2007]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Firefox 2.0.0.3 Release Notes | publisher = Mozilla | url = http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/2.0.0.3/releasenotes/ | accessdate = 2007-03-20 }}</ref>

==History==
{{main|History of Mozilla Firefox}}
[[Dave Hyatt]] and [[Blake Ross]] began working on the Firefox project as an experimental branch of the Mozilla project. They believed the commercial requirements of [[Netscape Communications Corporation|Netscape]]'s sponsorship and developer-driven [[feature creep]] compromised the utility of the Mozilla browser.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/ben/archives/009698.html | title = Where Did Firefox Come From? | accessdate=2007-01-24 | last= Goodger | first= Ben | authorlink= Ben Goodger | date = February 6, 2006 | publisher = Inside Firefox}}</ref> To combat what they saw as the Mozilla Suite's [[software bloat]], they created a pared-down<!--???--> browser, with which they intended to replace the Mozilla Suite. On [[April 3]] [[2003]], the [[Mozilla Organization]] announced that they planned to change their focus from the Mozilla Suite to Firefox and [[Mozilla Thunderbird|Thunderbird]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.mozilla.org/roadmap/roadmap-02-Apr-2003.html | title = mozilla development roadmap | accessdate = 2007-01-24 | last = Eich | first = Brendan | authorlink = Brendan Eich | coauthors = [[David Hyatt]] | date = April 2, 2003 | publisher = mozilla.org}}</ref>

The Firefox project has undergone several name changes. Originally titled ''Phoenix'', it was renamed because of [[trademark]] issues with [[Phoenix Technologies]]. The replacement name, ''Firebird'', provoked an intense response from the [[Firebird (database server)|Firebird]] free database software project.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.ibphoenix.com/main.nfs?a=ibphoenix&page=ibp_Mozilla0 | title = Mozilla browser becomes Firebird | accessdate = 2007-01-30 | publisher = IBPhoenix.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.linuxworld.com.au/index.php?id=1031068403 | title = Mozilla 'dirty deed' brings out a Firey response | accessdate = 2007-01-30 | date = April 16, 2003 | last = Dahdah | first = Howard | publisher = LinuxWorld.com.au | quote = "This must be one of the dirtiest deeds I've seen in open source so far," said Helen Borrie, a Firebird project administrator and documenter.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://news.com.com/2100-1032_3-1000146.html | title = Mozilla's Firebird gets wings clipped | accessdate = 2007-01-30 | date = May 6, 2003 | last = Festa | first = Paul | publisher = [[CNET|CNET.com]]}}</ref> In response, the Mozilla Foundation stated that the browser should always bear the name ''Mozilla Firebird'' to avoid confusion with the database software. Continuing pressure from the database server's development community forced another change; on [[February 9]] [[2004]], Mozilla Firebird became ''Mozilla Firefox'' (''Firefox'' for short).<ref>{{cite web | url = http://news.com.com/2100-7344-5156101.html | title = Mozilla holds 'fire' in naming fight | accessdate = 2007-01-24 | last = Festa | first = Paul | date = February 9, 2004 | publisher = CNET News.com}}</ref>

The Firefox project went through many versions before 1.0 was released on [[November 9]] [[2004]]. In addition to stability and security fixes, the Mozilla Foundation released its first major update to Firefox<U+2014>version 1.5<U+2014>on [[November 29]], [[2005]]. On [[October 24]] [[2006]], Mozilla released Firefox 2. This version includes updates to the [[Features of Mozilla Firefox#Tabbed browsing|tabbed browsing]] environment, the extensions manager, the GUI, and the find, search and software update engines; a new session restore feature; inline spell checking; and an anti-[[phishing]] feature which was implemented by [[Google]] as an extension<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.google.com/tools/firefox/safebrowsing | title = Google Safe Browsing for Firefox | accessdate = 2007-02-05 | publisher = Google.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://wiki.mozilla.org/index.php?title=Phishing_Protection:_Design_Documentation&oldid=46996#Background | title = Phishing Protection Design Documentation - Background | accessdate = 2007-01-24 | author = Mozilla.org wiki contributors | publisher = Mozilla.org wiki}}</ref> and later merged into the program itself.<ref name=fx2rnotes>{{cite web| url=http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/2.0/releasenotes/ |title= Mozilla Firefox 2 Release Notes | publisher=Mozilla Corporation |accessdate = 2006-12-19}}</ref>

==Features==
{{main|Features of Mozilla Firefox}}
Features included with Firefox are [[tabbed browsing]], [[incremental find]] (via the Find toolbar), [[Live bookmarking]], an integrated [[download manager]], and a search system. The user can customize Firefox with downloadable extensions, themes, and advanced preferences not present in the Options dialog that are accessible via the about:config page.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/releases/1.0.5.html | title = Mozilla Firefox 1.0.5 Release Notes | accessdate = 2007-02-05 | publisher = mozilla.com }}</ref> The developers of Firefox aimed to produce a browser that "just surfs the web"<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.blakeross.com/index.php?p=9 | title = The Firefox religion | accessdate = 2007-01-24 | last = Ross | first = Blake | authorlink = Blake Ross | date = January 22, 2005 | publisher = Blakeross.com (Blake Ross' weblog)}}</ref> and delivers the "best possible browsing experience to the widest possible set of people."<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.mozilla.org/projects/firefox/charter.html | title = Mozilla Firefox Development Charter | accessdate = 2007-01-24 | last= Goodger | first= Ben | authorlink= Ben Goodger | date = November 28, 2004 | publisher = mozilla.org}}</ref> Firefox provides an environment for web developers in which they can use built-in tools or extensions. These include the built-in [[JavaScript]] Console and the [[DOM Inspector]].

=== Security ===
Firefox uses [[Secure Sockets Layer|SSL/TLS]] to protect communications with web servers using strong [[cryptography]] when using the [[HTTPS]] protocol.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/pki/psm/help_21/ssl_help.html | title = Privacy & Security Preferences - SSL | accessdate = 2007-01-24 | date = August 31, 2001 | publisher = mozilla.org}}</ref> <!-- Do not return this statement until a source is found so as to satisfy FA standards: It also supports [[smart card|smartcards]] for secure login to web servers.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} --> It uses a [[sandbox (computer security)|sandbox security model]]<ref>{{cite web | url = http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/index.php?title=Bypassing_Security_Restrictions_and_Signing_Code&oldid=44355 | title = Bypassing Security Restrictions and Signing Code | accessdate = 2007-01-24 | last = Ranganathan | first = Arun | coauthors = Netscape Communications | date = November 11, 2002 | publisher = mozilla developer center}}</ref> and the developers use a "bug bounty" scheme, for finding fixes for some security<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.mozilla.org/security/bug-bounty.html | title = Mozilla Security Bug Bounty Program | accessdate = 2007-01-24 | date = September 3, 2004 | publisher = mozilla.org}}</ref> and feature additions.

Because Firefox has fewer and less severe publicly known unpatched security vulnerabilities than [[Internet Explorer]] (see [[Comparison of web browsers]]), improved security is often cited as a reason to switch from Internet Explorer to Firefox.<ref name="wsjacclaim">{{cite web | url=http://ptech.wsj.com/archive/ptech-20040916.html | title=How to Protect Yourself From Vandals, Viruses If You Use Windows | last=Mossberg | first=Walter S. | publisher=''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' | date=September 16, 2004 | accessdate=2006-10-17 | quote = I suggest dumping Microsoft's Internet Explorer Web browser, which has a history of security breaches.

A 2006 [[Symantec]] study showed that Firefox had surpassed other browsers, including Internet Explorer, in the number of vendor-confirmed vulnerabilities that year through September; these vulnerabilities were patched far more quickly than those found in IE and other browsers.<ref name="morebugs">{{cite web | url = http://www.techweb.com/wire/security/193005335 | title = Firefox Sports More Bugs, But IE Takes 9 Times Longer To Patch | accessdate = 2007-01-24 | last = Keizer | first = Gregg | date = September 25, 2006 | publisher = TechWeb.com}}</ref> Symantec later clarified their statement, saying that Firefox still had fewer security vulnerabilities, as counted by security researchers.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/03/07/76161_HNsymantecadjusts_1.html | title = Symantec adjusts browser bug count | accessdate = 2007-01-24 | last = McMillan | first = Robert | date = March 7, 2006 | publisher = InfoWorld}}</ref> As of February 25, 2007, Firefox 2 has two of six security vulnerabilities unpatched, marked "not critical" and "less critical" by [[Secunia]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://secunia.com/product/12434 | title = Vulnerability Report: Mozilla Firefox 2.0.x | accessdate = 2007-02-25 | publisher = Secunia}}</ref> Internet Explorer has five of seven security vulnerabilities unpatched, the most severe of which was rated "moderately critical" by Secunia.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://secunia.com/product/12366 | title = Vulnerability Report: Microsoft Internet Explorer 7.x | accessdate = 2007-02-25 | publisher = Secunia}}</ref> (Note that the number of "Secunia Advisories" listed for each doesn't reflect on the actual number of vulnerabilities reported for each. Advisory SA23282 for Mozilla Firefox 2.0.x
contains multiple vulnerabilities.)

== Licensing ==
Firefox is [[free software|free]]/[[open source software|open source]] software, and is [[tri-license|tri-licensed]] under the [[Mozilla Public License]] (MPL), [[GNU General Public License]] (GPL), and the [[GNU Lesser General Public License]] (LGPL). These licenses permit anyone to view, modify and/or redistribute the source code, and several publicly-released applications have been built on it; for example, [[Netscape (web browser)|Netscape]], [[Flock (web browser)|Flock]] and [[Songbird (software)|Songbird]] make use of code from Firefox.

The official end-user builds of Firefox distributed from mozilla.com are licensed under the Mozilla [[EULA]].<ref name=mozeula/> Several elements do not fall under the scope of the tri-license and have their use restricted by the EULA, including the trademarked Firefox name and artwork, and the [[proprietary software|proprietary]] [[Crash reporter#Mozilla|Talkback]] crash reporter. Because of this and the [[clickwrap]] agreement included in the Windows version, the [[Free Software Foundation]] (FSF) consider these builds [[proprietary software]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://directory.fsf.org/firefox.html | accessdate = 2007-01-30 | title = Firefox | date = April 1, 2004 | last = Casey | first = Janet | publisher = [[Free Software Foundation]] and [[UNESCO]] | work = [[Free Software Directory]]}} Entry updated [[2006-08-16]].</ref>

In the past, Firefox was licensed solely under the MPL,<ref name="mozrelicensing">{{cite web | url = http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/relicensing-faq.html | title = Mozilla Relicensing FAQ | accessdate = 2007-01-24 | date = December 11, 2006 | publisher = mozilla.org}}</ref> which the FSF criticizes for being weak [[copyleft]]; the license permits, in limited ways, proprietary [[derivative works]]. Additionally, code under the MPL cannot legally be linked with code under the GPL or the LGPL.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/netscape-npl.html | title = On the Netscape Public License | accessdate = 2007-01-24 | last = Stallman | first = Richard | authorlink = Richard Stallman | publisher = [[Free Software Foundation]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#MPL | title = Various Licenses and Comments about Them. Mozilla Public License (MPL) | accessdate = 2007-01-24 | publisher = [[Free Software Foundation]]}}</ref> To address these concerns, Mozilla re-licensed Firefox under the tri-license scheme of MPL, GPL, and LGPL. Since the re-licensing, developers have been free to choose the license under which they will receive the code, to suit their intended use: GPL or LGPL linking and derivative works when one of those licenses is chosen, or MPL use (including the possibility of proprietary derivative works) if they choose the MPL.<ref name="mozrelicensing"/>

===Trademark and logo issues===
[[Image:Deer Park Globe.png|thumb|The generic globe logo used when Firefox is compiled without the official branding]]
The name "Mozilla Firefox" is a registered [[trademark]]; along with the official Firefox logo, it may only be used under certain terms and conditions. Anyone may redistribute the official binaries in unmodified form and use the Firefox name and branding for such distribution, but restrictions are placed on distributions which modify the underlying source code.<ref>{{ cite web | url = http://www.mozilla.org/foundation/trademarks/policy.html | title = Mozilla Trademark Policy | accessdate = 2007-01-30 | publisher = mozilla.org }}</ref>

To allow distributions of the code ''without'' using the official branding, the Firefox source code contains a "branding switch".  This switch allows the code to be compiled without the official logo and name, for example to produce a derivative work unencumbered by restrictions on the Firefox trademark.  In the unbranded compilation the trademarked logo and name are replaced with a freely distributable generic globe logo and the name of the release series from which the modified version was derived.  The name "Deer Park" is used for derivatives of Firefox 1.5 and "Bon Echo" for derivatives of Firefox 2.0.

Outside of certain exceptions made for "community editions", distributing modified versions of Firefox under the "Firefox" name requires explicit approval from Mozilla for the changes made to the underlying code, and requires the use of ''all'' of the official branding.  For example, it is not permissible to use the name "Firefox" without also using the official logo. The [[Debian]] project notably fell afoul of this, by using the name "Mozilla Firefox" but not the official logo, in a modified distribution (because of restrictions on its use, the [[Debian Free Software Guidelines]] did not permit Debian to use the logo). Although Debian claimed to have reached a prior agreement which would have allowed this, they were told in 2006 by a representative of the Mozilla Foundation that this was not acceptable, and asked to either comply with the published trademark guidelines or cease using the "Firefox" name in their distribution.<ref>{{ cite web | url = http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=354622 | title = Debian Bug report logs - #354622: Uses Mozilla Firefox trademark without permission | accessdate = 2007-01-30 | publisher = Debian.org}}</ref> Ultimately, Debian switched to branding their modified version of Firefox as [[Iceweasel]].

[[Image:Mozilla-firefox-usage-data.svg|thumb|Usage share of Mozilla Firefox over time]]

Web-surfers have adopted Firefox rapidly, despite Internet Explorer coming pre-installed with every copy of the [[Windows OS]].  Internet Explorer has seen a steady decline of its usage share since Firefox's release. According to Dutch web analytics firm OneStat, by July 2006, Firefox was the second most widely-used browser, with 12.93% of global usage share.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.onestat.com/html/aboutus_pressbox44-mozilla-firefox-has-slightly-increased.html | title = Mozilla Firefox usage share remains stable | accessdate = 2007-01-30 | date = July 9, 2006 | publisher = OneStat.com}}</ref> By December 2006, according to data made available by U.S. firm NetApplications, Firefox's market share had grown to 14% globally.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://marketshare.hitslink.com/report.aspx?qprid=0 | title = Browser Market Share for December, 2006 
| accessdate = 2007-01-30 | month = December | year = 2006 | publisher = Net Applications}}</ref>

Downloads have continued at an increasing rate since Firefox 1.0 was released in November 2004, and as of [[February 12]], [[2007]] Firefox has been downloaded over 300 million times. This number does not include downloads using software updates or from third-party websites.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://feeds.spreadfirefox.com/downloads/firefox.xml | title = Spread Firefox: Mozilla Firefox Download Counts | accessdate = 2007-02-14 | publisher = [[Spread Firefox]]}}</ref> They do not represent a user count, as one download may be installed on many machines, or one person may download the software multiple times.

The release of the anti-[[phishing]] protection in Firefox 2 especially raised controversy.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.platinax.co.uk/news/26-10-2006/firefox-2-releases-privacy-storm | title =  Firefox 2 releases privacy storm | accessdate = 2007-01-24 | date = October 26, 2006 | last = Turner | first = Brian | publisher = Platinax}}</ref> Enabled by default anti-phishing protection is based on a list that is regularly (approximately each half hour) updated and downloaded to the user's computer<ref name="FirefoxPrivacyPolicy">{{cite web | url = http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/legal/privacy/firefox-en.html | title = Firefox Privacy Policy | accessdate = 2007-01-24 | month = October | year = 2006 | publisher = mozilla.com}}</ref> from Google's server (the user cannot change the data provider within the GUI<ref>{{cite web | url = https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=342188 | title = Bug 342188 - support changing the local list data provider | accessdate = 2007-01-24 | publisher = Bugzilla@Mozilla}}</ref> nor is informed who the default data provider is).

Barring [[Internet privacy]] issues over such anti-phishing protection, there are concerns on how Google may use the data, even though Firefox's privacy policy states that Google may not use personal information for any purposes other than the anti-phishing protection feature.<ref name="FirefoxPrivacyPolicy"/> On the other hand, Google admits that it "may share aggregated non-personal information with third parties outside of Google".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.google.com/intl/en/privacy.html |title=Google Privacy Policy Highlights |publisher=Google Inc. |date=2005-10-14 |accessdate=2006-12-11}}</ref>

=== Response from competition ===
Despite Firefox's gains on Internet Explorer, Microsoft's head of Australian operations, Steve Vamos, stated in late 2004 that he did not see Firefox as a threat and that there was not significant demand for the feature set of Firefox among Microsoft's users. However, many features that distinguished Firefox from previous versions of Internet Explorer are now available with [[Internet Explorer|Internet Explorer 7]]. Vamos stated that he had never used Firefox.<ref name="firefoxdoesnotthreatenie">{{cite web | url = http://www.zdnet.com.au/news/0,39023165,39166227,00.htm | title = Microsoft: Firefox does not threaten IE's market share | accessdate = 2007-01-24 | date = November 11, 2004 | last = Kotadia | first = Munir | publisher = ZDNet}}</ref> Microsoft Chairman [[Bill Gates]] has used Firefox, but he has commented "so much software gets downloaded all the time, but do people actually use it?"<ref name="billgates">{{cite web | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4508897.stm | title = The assault on software giant Microsoft | accessdate = 2007-01-24 | date = May 9, 2005 | last = Weber | first = Tim | publisher = [[BBC News]]}}</ref> A Microsoft [[United States Securities and Exchange Commission|SEC]] filing on [[June 30]] [[2005]] acknowledged that "competitors such as Mozilla offer software that competes with the Internet Explorer Web browsing capabilities of our Windows operating system products."<ref name="firefoxathreat">{{cite web | url = http://www.linux.org/news/2005/09/01/0001.html | title = SEC Filing Shows Microsoft Fears Firefox, Lawsuits Over Bugs | accessdate = 2007-01-24 | date = September 1, 2005 | last = Keizer | first = Gregg | publisher = Linux Online}}</ref>

== Future development ==
{{future software}}

According to the Firefox roadmap, future development will include version 3.0. Development on version 3.0, which will be based on [[Gecko (layout engine)|Gecko]] 1.9, occurs simultaneously on the Mozilla trunk. Newer versions of Firefox will use the [[cairo (graphics)|cairo]] graphics library as the rendering layer instead of the platform's native rendering engine.<ref>{{cite web | title=Mozilla Cairo Vector Graphics | url=http://web.archive.org/web/20060219212346/http://www.mozillazine.org/talkback.html?article=6498 | accessdate = 2007-01-24 | date = April 24, 2005 | publisher=mozillaZine}} A page describing the future usage of cairo.</ref>

The largest known change for Firefox 3 is the implementation of [[Gecko (layout engine)|Gecko]] 1.9, an updated [[layout engine]]. It will also provide CSS3 columns.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/index.php?title=CSS3_Columns&oldid=44372 | title = CSS3 Columns | accessdate = 2007-02-07 | publisher = Mozilla Developer Center}}</ref> Firefox 3 will include features that were bumped from Firefox 2, such as the overhauled Places system for storing bookmarks and history in an [[SQLite]] backend, according to the wiki.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://wiki.mozilla.org/index.php?title=Places&oldid=46000 | title=Places | date=[[2006-10-16]] | accessdate=2007-02-05 | author = Mozilla Wiki contributors | publisher = Mozilla Wiki}}</ref> Due to lack of support for [[Windows 95]], Windows 98, Windows Me, and [[Windows NT 4.0]] in [[Cairo (graphics)|Cairo]], and because [[Microsoft]] decided to end support for [[Windows 98]] and [[Windows Me]] on [[July 11]] [[2006]], Firefox 3 will not run on those operating systems.

There are expected to be many more enhancements to already included standards and adding of new ones in the Gecko 1.9 period.

=== Version 4.0 ===
On [[October 13]] [[2006]], [[Brendan Eich]], Mozilla's [[Chief Technology Officer]], wrote about the plans for Mozilla 2.0, the platform on which Firefox 4 is likely to be based. These changes include improving and removing [[XPCOM]] [[API]]s, switching to standard C++ features, [[just-in-time compilation]] with [[JavaScript]] 2 (known as the [[Tamarin (JIT)|Tamarin]] project), and tool-time and runtime security checks.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/roadmap/archives/2006/10/mozilla_2.html | title=Mozilla 2 | last=Eich | first=Brendan | date=[[2006-10-13]] | accessdate=2006-09-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/roadmap/archives/2006/11/project_tamarin.html | title=Project Tamarin | last=Eich | first=Brendan | date=[[2006-11-07]] | accessdate=2006-11-14}}</ref>
