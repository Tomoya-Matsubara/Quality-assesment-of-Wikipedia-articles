==Playing career==
Watson most recently played for the [[Charleston Battery]] of the [[USL First Division]].  He joined the Battery in 2006, after his third stint with the [[Vancouver Whitecaps (USL)|Vancouver Whitecaps]], having played 10 games for the 86ers in the summer of 1993 when he was named an APSL First Team All Star, and 9 games in 1994.  

Having played for the [[University of British Columbia]], Watson was named a [[Canadian Soccer League (1987<U+2013>1992)|Canadian Soccer League]] All Star in his rookie professional season, with the [[Hamilton Steelers (CSL)|Hamilton Steelers]] in 1991. He went on to play for [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] in the [[Football League First Division]] in 1993-94 and 1994-95 seasons.  In 1996, he played for the [[Columbus Crew]] and [[New England Revolution]] of [[Major League Soccer|MLS]].  In 1997, he played for the [[Seattle Sounders (USL)|Seattle Sounders]] of the A-League and was named league First Team.  

Watson played for [[<U+00D6>sters IF]] in [[Superettan|Swedish First Division]] for the 1997-98 and 1998-99 seasons.  He then played the next three seasons in the Football League's Second Division, 1998<U+2013>99 and 1999-00 with [[Oxford United F.C.|Oxford United]] and the 2000-01 season with [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]].  He then returned to [[North America]] to play the 2001 MLS season with [[DC United]].  He then played the 2002, 2003, and 2004 seasons with the [[Charleston Battery]] of the A-League.  He was named the league's Defender of the Year and to its First Team in 2002, and to the league's second team in 2004.      

==National team==
For Canada, Watson has appeared 78 times for the 'A' national team during a 14-year span. He has played in four [[Football World Cup|World Cup]] qualifying campaigns <ref>[http://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/statisticsandrecords/players/player=94504/index.html Record at FIFA Tournaments] - FIFA</ref>.  and on the [[2000 CONCACAF Gold Cup]] side that won the tournament.  Watson scored the winning goal for Canada in the semi-final of the 2000 Gold Cup, a match Canada won 1-0 over Trinidad and Tobago.

Watson emerged as one of Canada's more quotable players.  Before a [[2001 FIFA Confederations Cup]] match in Japan, he implied that Canada would be willing to employ their physical style by noting that the Japanese players "don't run so fast when they're lying on the ground."  He also once referred to English born-and-bred teammate [[Marc Bircham]] as a "plastic Canadian" in jest.
