'''New York State Route&nbsp;177''' ('''NY&nbsp;177''') is an east<U+2013>west [[state highway]] in the [[North Country, New York|North Country]] of [[New York]] in the United States. It extends from [[Interstate 81 in New York|Interstate&nbsp;81]] (I-81) exit&nbsp;42 in the [[Jefferson County, New York|Jefferson County]] town of [[Adams (town), New York|Adams]] to [[New York State Route 12|NY&nbsp;12]] west of the [[Lewis County, New York|Lewis County]] village of [[Lowville (village), New York|Lowville]]. NY&nbsp;177 intersects [[U.S. Route 11 in New York|U.S. Route&nbsp;11]] (US&nbsp;11) in Adams Center and meets Lewis County's [[County Route 21 (Lewis County, New York)|County Route&nbsp;21]] (CR&nbsp;21), formerly part of [[New York State Route 194|NY&nbsp;194]], at Barnes Corners. NY&nbsp;177 originally began at US&nbsp;11 when it was assigned in 1930. It was extended west to its present terminus in the 1950s following the construction of I-81.

==Route description==
NY&nbsp;177 begins at interchange&nbsp;42 on [[Interstate 81 in New York|I-81]] in the town of [[Adams (town), New York|Adams]]. The route progresses away from the interstate to the southeast, passing the [[Adams Center (New York Central Railroad station)|former railroad station in Adams Center]] before intersecting with [[U.S. Route 11 in New York|US&nbsp;11]] in the center of the hamlet. At this intersection, NY&nbsp;177 turns eastward, leaving the populated hamlet for a rural backdrop and into the hamlet of Honeyville. Honeyville consists of little more than a few houses centered around the intersection of NY&nbsp;177 and Fuller Road. After leaving Honeyville, NY&nbsp;177 intersects with [[County Route 155 (Jefferson County, New York)|CR&nbsp;155]], where it turns to the southeast into the town of [[Rodman, New York|Rodman]]. After crossing a creek, the route enters the hamlet of Rodman as a two-lane road through the southern end of the hamlet. During the stretch around Rodman, NY&nbsp;177 intersects with [[County Route 85 (Jefferson County, New York)|CR&nbsp;85]] (Creek Road) and [[County Route 97 (Jefferson County, New York)|CR&nbsp;97]] (Washington Park Road / School Street) before leaving the hamlet.<ref name="bing">{{bing maps |url=http://binged.it/Hz9472 |title=overview map of NY 177|accessdate=April 10, 2012}}</ref>

NY&nbsp;177 continues winding itself to the southeast through the town of Rodman, as a rural two-lane highway. After Williams Road, the route makes several bends in to the south and east, straightening out eastward at an intersection with the northern terminus of [[County Route 95 (Jefferson County, New York)|CR&nbsp;95]]. This eastward progression remains stagnant as NY&nbsp;177 continues eastward past [[County Route 189 (Jefferson County, New York)|CR&nbsp;189]]. After a short, empty stretch of roadway, NY&nbsp;177 crosses the county line into [[Lewis County, New York|Lewis County]], where it enters the town of [[Pinckney, New York|Pinckney]]. Through Pinckney, the route turns to the northeast, crossing Old State Road before bending and turning southeastward into the hamlet of Barnes Corners. In Barnes Corners, the dense forest retreats for a rural community, where NY&nbsp;177 intersects with [[County Route 21 (Lewis County, New York)|CR&nbsp;21]] and [[County Route 69 (Lewis County, New York)|CR&nbsp;69]] (Seven-by-Nine Road).<ref name="bing" /> CR&nbsp;21 is the former southern terminus of [[New York State Route 194|NY&nbsp;194]], a designation eliminated in 1980.<ref name="2009log">{{cite book |url=https://www.dot.ny.gov/divisions/operating/oom/transportation-systems/repository/2012%20tour-bk.pdf |title=Official Description of Highway Touring Routes, Bicycling Touring Routes, Scenic Byways, & Commemorative/Memorial Designations in New York State |author=New York State Department of Transportation |month=January |year=2012 |format=PDF |accessdate=April 10, 2012}}</ref>

After leaving Barnes Corners, NY&nbsp;177 returns to being the two-lane rural roadway, progressing southeastward through the town of Pinckney. Despite the rural scenery, the route does enter the hamlet of New Boston and the junction with [[County Route 23 (Lewis County, New York)|CR&nbsp;23]] (Liberty Road). Passing a few farms, the route turns to the northeast near Mile Square Road, and enters the hamlet of Bellwood, within the town of [[Harrisburg, New York|Harrisburg]]. Bellwood consists of a few houses and an intersection with [[County Route 27 (Lewis County, New York)|CR&nbsp;27]] and [[County Route 28 (Lewis County, New York)|CR&nbsp;28]] (Sears Pond Road). Leaving Bellwood, NY&nbsp;177 continues eastward into the hamlet of Windecker, which consists only of a few houses. Leaving Windecker, NY&nbsp;177 bends to the southeast and enters the town of [[Lowville (town), New York|Lowville]], passing a few farms and wind turbines before bending into the hamlet of West Lowville. In West Lowville, NY&nbsp;177 intersects with [[New York State Route 12|NY&nbsp;12]], which continues eastward to the village of [[Lowville (village), New York|Lowville]]. NY&nbsp;177 terminates at this intersection.<ref name="bing" />
