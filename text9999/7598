The '''Milwaukee Road''', officially the '''Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad''' ('''CMSP&P RR''') {{reporting mark|MILW}}, was a [[Class I railroad]] that operated in the midwest and northwest of the [[United States]] from [[1847]] until its acquisition by the [[Soo Line]] railway on [[January 1]], [[1986]].  The company went through several official names and faced bankruptcy several times in that period.  While the railroad does not exist as a separate entity anymore, it is still commemorated in buildings like the historic Milwaukee Road Depot in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]] and in railroad hardware still maintained by railfans, such as the [[Milwaukee Road 261]] [[steam engine|steam]] [[locomotive]].
==History==
The Milwaukee Road appeared as the '''Milwaukee and Waukesha Railroad''' when incorporated in 1847, but soon changed its name to '''Milwaukee and Mississippi'''.  After three years, the first train ran from [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin|Milwaukee]] to [[Wauwatosa, Wisconsin]], and the first [[passenger train]] ran on [[February 25]], [[1851]].  In [[1874]], the name was changed to '''Chicago, Milwaukee, and St. Paul'''.  By [[1887]], the railroad had lines running through [[Wisconsin]], [[Minnesota]], [[Iowa]], [[South Dakota]], and the [[Upper Peninsula]] of [[Michigan]].

===Expansion===
In the 1890s, the Milwaukee's directors increasingly felt that they had to extend the railroad to the Pacific in order to remain competitive with other roads. A survey in 1901 estimated costs to build to the [[Pacific Northwest]] as $45 million.  In 1905, the board approved the Pacific Extension, now estimated at $60 million.  The contract for the westernmost part of the route was awarded to [[Horace Chapin Henry]] of Seattle.   Construction began in 1906 and was completed in 1909.  The route chosen was to be 18 miles shorter than the shortest competitor's, as well as better grades than some.  It was an expensive route, however, since the Milwaukee, receiving few land grants, had to buy most of the land or acquire smaller railroads.  In addition, the five mountain ranges that had to be crossed (the Saddles, Belts, [[Rocky Mountains|Rockies]], [[Cascade Mountains|Cascades]], and [[Bitterroot Range|Bitterroots]]) required major [[civil engineering]] works and the use of additional locomotive power.  The completion of 2,300 miles of railroad in only three years was a major feat.  

Some historians question the choice of route, however, since it bypassed some population centers and passed through areas with limited local traffic potential. Much of the line paralleled the [[Northern Pacific Railroad]]. It was primarily a long-haul route.

===Electrification===
The Milwaukee soon found that operation of steam locomotives over the mountain passes was difficult, with winter temperatures that reached -40<U+00B0>F.  [[Railway electrification system|Electrification]] seemed to be the answer, especially with abundant hydro-electric power in the mountains and a ready source of copper on-line at [[Anaconda, Montana]].  In 1914, electrification began between [[Harlowton, Montana]] and [[Avery, Idaho]].  The first electric train ran in 1915 between [[Three Forks, Montana]] and [[Deer Lodge, Montana]].  The system used was 3,000 volt [[direct current|DC]] [[overhead line]].

In 1917, the board approved the construction of a separate electrified district between [[Othello, Washington]] and [[Tacoma, Washington]], extended to Seattle in [[1927]].  The two electrified districts were never connected, but a total of 656 route-miles (1,056 km) of railroad were electrified, making it the largest electrified railroad in the US.

The electrification was successful from an engineering and operational standpoint, but the cost of building the Puget Sound Extension and electrification had cost $257 million, not the $45 million the road had originally budgeted for reaching the Pacific. The debt load and reduced revenues brought the road to bankruptcy in 1925.

The railroad was re-organized as the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad Company in 1927 and officially adopted the familiar trade name The Milwaukee Road. Also in 1927, the road launched its second edition of the [[Olympian Hiawatha| ''Olympian'']] as a premier luxury limited passenger train and opened its first railroad-owned tourist hotel, The [[Gallatin Gateway Inn]] in Montana.

The company had hardly a chance to make anything of its fresh start before the [[Great Depression]] hit.  Despite innovations such as the famous ''[[Hiawatha (passenger train)|Hiawatha]]'' high speed trains that averaged over 100&nbsp;mph, the road again filed for bankruptcy in 1935.  The Milwaukee operated under trusteeship until [[December 1]], [[1945]].

===Postwar===
[[Image:OP-5225.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad train No. 4, the ''Pioneer Limited'', passes near [[Deerfield, Illinois]] on [[June 22]], [[1946]].]]
Relative success followed the war. The railroad [[dieselisation|dieselized]] in the mid 1950s, replacing most steam locomotives by 1955 and retiring the last in 1957. Other modernizations included modern freight yards. In association with  [[Union Pacific Railroad]], the Milwaukee took over operations of the "Cities" &mdash; the ''[[City of Los Angeles]]'', the ''[[City of San Francisco]]'', the ''[[City of Denver]]'', the ''[[City of Portland]]'', as well as the all-coach ''[[Challenger]]'' from the [[Chicago and North Western Railway]].

===1960s===
The whole railroad industry found itself in decline in the late 1950s and the 1960s, but the Milwaukee was hit particularly hard.  The Midwest was overbuilt with too many competing roads, while the competition on the transcontinental routes to the Pacific was extremely tough as well.  The premier transcontinental streamliner, the ''[[Olympian Hiawatha]]'', despite the innovative scenic observation cars was cancelled in 1961, becoming the first visible casualty.  The resignation of President [[John P. Kiley]] in 1957 and his replacement with the fairly inexperienced [[William John Quinn]] was a pivotal moment; from that point onward, the road's management was fixated on merger with another railroad as the solution to the Milwaukee's problems.  

Railroad mergers had to be approved by the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]], however, and in 1969 the ICC effectively blocked the merger with the [[Chicago and North Western Railway]] (C&NW) that the Milwaukee Road had counted on and had been planning for since 1964. The ICC asked for terms that the C&NW was not willing to agree to.  The merger of the "Hill Lines" <U+2014> the [[Northern Pacific]], the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern]], and the [[Burlington Route]] <U+2014> was approved at around the same time, and the merged [[Burlington Northern]] came into being on [[March 3]], [[1970]], completely surrounding the Milwaukee Road.

===Early 1970s===
Almost immediately after the BN merger, the owners of the C&NW offered to sell the railroad to the Milwaukee outright.  The Milwaukee board rejected the offer, even though it would have given them what they had wanted throughout most of the previous decade, stating that they now believed only merger with a larger system <U+2014> not a slightly smaller one <U+2014> could save the railroad.  Almost immediately, the road filed with the ICC to be included in the Union Pacific merger with the [[Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad]].  Nothing came of this, nor other attempts to force the Milwaukee into other mergers against the desires of the other participants.

Fortunately for the Milwaukee, the BN merger required opening more markets to competitors, and in 1971-73, the MILW's traffic on its Pacific Extension increased substantially, although the reverse was true on its Midwest lines.  The deferred maintenance on the railroad's physical plant, however, which had been building up all through the 1960s as the road attempted to polish its financial appearance for merger, was beginning to cause problems.  The road's financial problems were exacerbated by the road's practice of improving its earnings during that period by selling off its wholly owned cars to financial institutions and leasing them back.  The lease charges became steeper and steeper, and more and more cars needed to be sold off in order to pay for the lease payments.  The railroad's fleet of cars was becoming older and older because more money was being spent on finance payments for the old cars than on buying new ones.  This, in turn, contributed to car shortages that turned away business.

===De-electrification===
In February 1973, and against the advice of studies conducted by both the railroad and independent groups, the Milwaukee decided to scrap its electrification scheme.  The board of directors considered the electrification scheme an impediment to its merger and consolidation plans, and that the money required to maintain it would be better spent elsewhere.  The high copper prices of time, and the $10 million the railroad estimated it would get for selling off the copper overhead wire, contributed to the decision.

The surveys had found that an investment of $39 million could have closed the "gap" between the two electrified districts, bought new locomotives, and upgraded the electrical equipment all along the line.  Furthermore, the displaced diesel locomotives could have been used elsewhere and thus reduced the requirement to purchase new, reducing the true cost of the plan to only $18 million. [[General Electric]] even proposed underwriting the financing because of the railroad's financial position.

Rejecting this, the railroad dismantled its electrification just as the [[1973 oil crisis]] took hold.  By 1974, when the electrification was shut down, the electric locomotives operated at half the cost of the diesels that replaced them.  Worse, the railroad had to spend $39 million, as much as the GE-sponsored revitalisation plan, to buy more diesel locomotives to replace the electrics, and only received $5 million for the copper scrap since prices had fallen.

The badly-maintained track, which was the part of the system most in need of renewal, was never touched.

===Decline to bankruptcy===
Things didn't get any better after the electrification was dismantled.  By 1977, much of the Pacific Extension was under slow orders due to the condition of the track, and transit times had almost tripled.  Cars needing repair were being sidelined for lack of money, and locomotives needing major service were being parked.  The road filed for bankruptcy for the third time on [[December 19]], [[1977]].

The bankruptcy resulted in the Milwaukee abandoning the Pacific Extension completely in 1980 and restructuring as a small regional line, which was eventually taken over by the [[Soo Line]] in 1985.  However, the ICC's auditors discovered, too late, that for some reason the Pacific Extension's expenses had been double-entered during most of the 1970s.  Far from the unprofitable boat-anchor the railroad and the bankruptcy trustees said it was, the ICC found that the Pacific Extension had been returning a profit to the railroad even through 1977 and 1978, at which time traffic was severely down due to the road's problems.

===Regional railroad, 1981-1985===
The restructured '''Milwaukee Road, Inc.''' ("Milwaukee II") proved no more profitable than the previous, losing money every year.  Competition by other, larger railroads for control of the Great Lakes area attracted a bidding war for purchase of the railroad in 1984, with the C&NW and the SOO bidding up the prices.  Railroad operations were sold to the [[Soo Line Railroad]] on [[February 21]], [[1985]] and the Milwaukee Road officially ceased to be an operating railroad as of [[January 1]], [[1986]]. [[As of 2007]], a few locomotives transferred as part of the sale to the Soo Line remain in the Milwaukee's paint scheme, sans the Milwaukee Road logo.

===Epilogue===
The successor-in-interest to what remained of the Milwaukee Road after the Soo Line sale was its holding company, the Chicago Milwaukee Corporation (CMC).  This Corporation's primary function was now to dispose of Milwaukee Road rolling stock and real estate not sold to the Soo Line, primarily former urban rail yard locations in cities such as Milwaukee and Minneapolis.  These properties were developed into big-box retail<ref>{{Citation| last = Murphy| first = Mary Beth| title = New Jewel/Osco alienates some of its neighbors, delights others| newspaper = Milwaukee Journal Sentinel| date = [[1999-09-19]]| year = 1999 }}</ref> or industrial sites.  The CMC itself was beset with legal and financial woes, filing for bankruptcy (under its new name CMC Heartland Partners) as a result of environmental cleanup costs and liabilities at former Milwaukee Road sites.<ref>{{Citation| last = Yue| first = Lorene| title = Heartland Partners files for Chapter 11| journal= Crain's Chicago Business| date = [[2006-04-28]]| year=2006}}</ref> 

==Passenger train service==
The Milwaukee Road aggressively marketed passenger service through much of its history, maintaining a high quality of service until the end of private intercity passenger operations in 1971. The Milwaukee prided itself on its passenger operations, providing the nation with some of its most innovative and colorful trains. The railroads home-built equipment was among some of the best passenger equipment ever run on any American railroad. The Milwaukee's reputation for high quality service was the principal reason that the Union Pacific shifted its service to the Milwaukee Road for its "City" streamliners in 1955. 

The Milwaukee Road's ''Pioneer Limited'' was one of the nations' first named trains and its colorful ''Hiawatha'' trains were among the nation's finest streamliners. The post-World War II ''Hiawatha'' trains remain a high water mark for passenger train industrial design.

Starting in November, 1955 the Milwaukee Road assumed joint operation of the Union Pacific's ''[[City of Los Angeles]]'', ''[[City of Portland]]'', ''[[City of Denver]]'', and ''[[Challenger (passenger train)|Challenger]]'' trains as well as the Union Pacific/Southern Pacific ''[[City of San Francisco]]''. 

After assuming operation of the UP's services, the Milwaukee Road gradually dropped its orange and maroon paint scheme in favor of UP's Armour yellow, grey, and red, finding the latter easier to keep clean.

The Milwaukee Road's streamlined passenger services are unique in that most of its equipment was built by the railroad at its Milwaukee Menomonee Valley shops including the four generations of ''Hiawatha'' equipment introduced in 1933-34, 1935, 1937-38, and 1947-48. Most striking were the "beavertail" observation cars of the 1930s and the "Skytop Lounge" observation cars by industrial designer [[Brooks Stevens]] in the 1940s. Extended "Skytop Lounge" cars were also ordered from Pullman for ''Olympian Hiawatha'' service in 1951. The ''Olympian Hiawatha'' set was later sold to the [[Canadian National Railway]].
