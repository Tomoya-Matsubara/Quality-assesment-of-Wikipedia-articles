A '''water stop''' or '''water station''' on a [[rail transport|railroad]] is a place where [[train]]s stop to replenish [[water]]. The stopping of the train itself is also referred to as "water stop". The term originates from the times of [[steam engine]]s, when large amounts of water were essential. In these times they were also called '''wood and water stops''' or '''coal and water stops''', since it was reasonable to replenish engines with [[fuel]] as well.

In early times, water stops were necessary every 7<U+2013>10 miles and consumed much travel time.<ref>[http://www.cityofallen.org/pdf/DrivingTourBrochure1.pdf. "History of Allen"], a brochure about [[Allen, Texas]]</ref><ref>For example, a section of the [[Atlantic and Pacific Railroad]] running in the [[Mojave Desert]] between [[Ludlow, California|Ludlow]] and [[Amboy, California|Amboy]] had water stops spaced by 5<U+2013>10 miles: [[Lavic, California|Lavic]], [[Ragtown, California|Ragtown]], [[Ash Hill, California|Ash Hill]], [[Klondike, California|Klondike]], [[Siberia, California|Siberia]], [[Bagdad, California|Bagdad]], see [http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=34.557016,-115.745065&spn=0.40,0.40 Google Maps], all eight of them being [[ghost town]]s now.</ref> With the introduction of [[Tender (rail)|tender]]s, trains could run 100<U+2013>150 miles (160<U+2013>240&nbsp;km) without a refill.

To accumulate the water, water stops employed [[water tank]]s, [[water tower]]s and [[tank pond]]s. 

In the [[United States]], many water stops along new railways evolved into new settlements. When a train stopped for water and positioned by a water tower, the [[fireman (steam engine)|boilerman]] swung out the [[spigot]] arm over the water tender and "jerked" the chain to begin watering. This gave rise to a 19th-century slang term "Jerkwater town" for towns too insignificant to have a regular [[train station]].<ref>Irving Lewis Allen (1993) "The City in Slang: New York Life and Popular Speech",  Oxford University Press, ISBN 0-19-509265-1 [http://books.google.com/books?id=j41z0yeKbeIC&pg=PT39&dq=%22water+stops%22+train&sig=tLaxiUXHul8gvck1N7YNwJ6BvKI#PPT39,M1 p. 254]</ref> The variants were "Jerktown" and "Jerkwater", which are still in use in the meaning of "insignificant",<ref>[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/jerkwater "Jerkwater"], ''[[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]]'', Fourth Edition. Houghton Mifflin Company, 2004.  (accessed: October 03, 2007)
</ref> although today "Jerktown" is rather understood as a "town of [[wikt:jerk|jerk]]s". 

The water was initially pumped by [[windmill]]s, [[watermill]]s, or by [[hand pump]]s often by the train crew themselves. Later, small steam and gasoline engines were used.<ref>Maury Klein (2000) "The Life & Legend of [[E.H. Harriman]]", UNC Press, ISBN 0-8078-2517-4  [http://books.google.com/books?id=sl_SNYTCjjkC&pg=PA142&dq=%22water+stops%22+train&sig=K-o1TwgrRE3TMKnorBQtxwhgrTM p. 142]</ref>

Isolated water stops were among favorite [[ambush]] places for [[train robber]]s.<ref>Roy R. Roberg, Jack L. Kuykendall (1993) "Police & Society", Wadsworth Pub. Co. ISBN 0-534-19872-4, [http://books.google.com/books?id=esuORZ40n6IC&q=%22water+stops%22+train&dq=%22water+stops%22+train&pgis=1 p. 81]</ref>

As the U.S. railroad system expanded, large numbers of tank ponds were built by damming various small [[Stream|creeks]] that intersected the tracks in order to provide water for water stops.  [[Largemouth bass]] were often stocked in tank ponds, see "[[Bass fishing]]" for more.<ref>Waterman, Charles F., ''Black Bass & the Fly Rod'', Stackpole Books (1993)</ref><ref>Ryan, Will, ''Smallmouth Strategies for the Fly Rod, Lyons & Burford Publishers (1996)</ref>

With the replacement of steam engines by [[diesel locomotive]]s many of them, especially in deserted areas, have become ghost towns. The town of [[Coalinga, California]], gets its name from the original coal stop at this location, ''Coaling A''.
