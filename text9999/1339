{{Nihongo|'''''Kanon'''''|<U+30AB><U+30CE><U+30F3>}} is a [[Japan]]ese [[visual novel]] developed by [[Key (company)|Key]] and released on [[June 4]] [[1999]]. The original version, first available on the [[IBM PC compatible|PC]], contains [[Eroge|content of a sexual nature]], though a version without this content was released on [[January 7]] [[2000]] for the PC. Subsequent clean versions were sold playable on the [[Dreamcast]], [[PlayStation 2]], and [[PlayStation Portable]]. The adult and all-ages PC versions were re-released with added support for [[Windows 2000]]/[[Windows XP|XP]] under the name ''Kanon Standard Edition''.

The [[gameplay]] in ''Kanon'' follows a linear plotline where the player interacts at pre-determined times to choose several options that appear on the [[computer display|monitor]]. The game was developed so that the focus for the player would be an intricate plot and the appeal of the five female main characters. The title is generally believed to be derived from the musical term [[canon (music)|canon]]; the second TV adaptation plays on this association by using of [[Pachelbel]]'s ''Kanon D-dur'', or ''[[Canon in D]]'', as a background piece at certain instances throughout the series.

''Kanon'' has made several transitions to other media. There are two [[anime]] adaptations, the first being a thirteen episode TV series that first aired on [[January 30]] [[2002]], which includes one episode of an [[Original Video Animation|OVA]], ''Kazahana'', released on [[May 3]] [[2003]], both by the animation studio [[Toei Animation]]. The second anime adaptation, created by [[Kyoto Animation]], aired in Japan between [[October 5]] [[2006]] and [[March 15]] [[2007]], containing 24 episodes. The story was also adapted into novels, [[drama CD]]s, and a [[manga]] series.

''Kanon'''s popularity outside of Japan can be signified by the fans' efforts, such as those in [[South Korea]] and [[China]], to release unofficial translated versions to the public.<ref name="hentai.co.uk"/>

==Plot==
''Kanon'''s story, set in the middle of winter, regards a group of five girls who are connected back to the same boy. Yuichi Aizawa, the main protagonist, had visited the city where the story takes place seven years prior to the story's beginning.

In the beginning Yuichi is very detached from the city and its inhabitants. Prior to his return, it is decided that he is to stay with his cousin, Nayuki Minase, and her mother, Akiko. After his long absence, Yuichi has forgotten all but minor details of what happened seven years before and is in need of being reminded of what he left behind.

On the day after Yuichi's return, he is out with Nayuki who is showing him around town. Nayuki remembers that she has to buy things for dinner and Yuichi is reluctant to go with her, arguing that he might get lost. Moments after Nayuki left him waiting on the sidewalk, a strange girl named Ayu Tsukimiya barges into him with little warning. Upon recovering, she drags him away to a nearby caf<U+00E9> and confesses to inadvertently stealing a bag filled with [[taiyaki]] after being accidentally scared away by the salesman before she had a chance to pay. Yuichi then drags Ayu back to the salesman, they both apologize for the trouble, and Ayu is forgiven. They decide to meet up again another day and Ayu scampers off.

Yuichi is not aware at first, but three other girls which he had forgotten are familiar with him. Throughout the story, as he learns about the supernatural undertones of the town, Yuichi is reminded of each girl and the events of seven years ago in the city covered in snow.

==Setting and themes==
[[Image:Kanon city.png|thumb|200px|left|The city of ''Kanon''.]]
There are several important locations featured in the ''Kanon'' story that are based on those of the [[Moriguchi, Osaka|Moriguchi]] city in [[Japan]].<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.ne.jp/asahi/chibiusa/rini/kanon/|title=The setting is based on Moriguchi, Japan|accessdate=2006-12-28|language=Japanese}}</ref> [[Key (company)|Key]] have consistently used real world locations as inspiration for their game settings which occurred with their later game ''[[Air (visual novel)|Air]]''. The location names are seldomly mentioned explicitly in their works.

The time of year the story occurred in was during winter, and since it often snowed periodically over the course of the entire story, the city was always presented covered in a layer of snow. The covering snow helps to develop the mysterious mood that the story flows through.

There are recurring themes that appear throughout the story. A music theme is present, as the name of the series is generally believed to be based on a classical composition named ''[[Canon in D]]''. The episode titles from the 2006 anime remake have parts in their titles related to music, such as [[overture]] and [[introit]]. Another theme is the presence of snow around the entire city which helps to develop a mysterious mood coupled with a supernatural theme which the story revolves around. Furthermore, [[miracle]]s play a large part in the story; ''Kanon'''s plotline and characters are influenced by various instances where miracles occur.<ref>'''Untranslated quote:''' <U+8D77><U+304D><U+306A><U+3044><U+304B><U+3089><U+3001><U+5947><U+8DE1><U+3063><U+3066><U+8A00><U+3046><U+3093><U+3067><U+3059><U+3088><br>'''Translated quote:''' "It's called a miracle because it doesn't happen."<br>{{citeweb|url=http://61.199.33.219/info/visual/key/kanon_se_n/|title=Information on the Kanon Standard Edition|accessdate=2007-02-15|language=Japanese}}</ref> The act of promising and keeping promises is found throughout the story.<ref>'''Untranslated quote:''' <U+7D04><U+675F><U+3001><U+3060><U+3088><br>'''Translated quote:''' "It's a promise."<br>{{citeweb|url=http://61.199.33.219/info/visual/key/kanon_se_n/|title=Information on the Kanon Standard Edition|accessdate=2007-02-15|language=Japanese}}</ref> Yuichi eventually makes important promises to the five main girls while at the same time fulfilling past promises he had made with them when he used to visit the city as a kid.

One of the sub-themes in the story is [[amnesia]], or the loss of memory; three of the main characters - Yuichi, Ayu and Makoto - are presented to suffer a form of amnesia in varying degrees, used as a plot device to advance the story. Another sub-theme deals with the favorite foods of the five main heroines. ''[[Newtype (magazine)|Newtype USA]]'' stated in an article on ''Kanon'' that, "it's when the characters are eating something really tasty that they seem most beautiful and alive," despite the somber setting and overall tone of the series.<ref>{{cite book|title=Newtype USA|publisher=Kadokawa Shoten|date=January 2007 issue|pages=62-63|accessdate=2007-02-02}}</ref> These five foods of choice are: [[taiyaki]] (Ayu), strawberries (Nayuki), [[nikuman]] (Makoto), ice cream (Shiori), and [[gyudon]] (Mai).

==Gameplay==
[[Image:Kanon Ayu screenshot.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Example of what average conversation looks like in ''Kanon''. Here, Yuichi is talking with Ayu.]]
The gameplay requires little interaction from the player as most of the duration of the game is spent on simply reading the text that will appear on the screen, signifying that a [[dialogue]] has occurred. In the original release, there was no voice acting for the characters, but in the later versions ported for the [[Sega Dreamcast|Dreamcast]] and [[PlayStation 2]], full-voice acting was included in order to heighten the experience.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://72.14.253.104/search?q=cache:Sba_eTdpdWoJ:forums.visualnews.net/showthread.php%3Ft%3D6600&hl=en&gl=us&ct=clnk&cd=12&client=firefox-a|title=Cached page at forums.visualnews.net on the unofficial ''Kanon'' voice path|accessdate=2007-01-09}}</ref> The only exception was Yuichi Aizawa who was not voiced in either version. This was later changed with the [[PlayStation Portable]] release with Yuichi being voiced by [[Tomokazu Sugita]].<ref name="sega">{{citeweb|url=http://sega.jp/psp/kanon/|title=Sega.jp on the ''Kanon'' PSP release|accessdate=2007-01-10|language=Japanese}}</ref> Every so often, the player will come to a "decision point" where he or she is given the chance to choose from usually two to four options that are displayed on the screen. During these times, gameplay pauses until a choice is made that furthers the plot in a specific direction, depending on which choice the player makes. There are five main plotlines that the player will have the chance to experience, one for each of the heroines in the story. In order to view the five plotlines to their entirety, the player will have to replay the game multiple times and choose different choices during the decision points to further the plot in an alternate direction.

One of the goals of the original version's gameplay was for the player to enable viewing of several [[Hentai|H scene]]s depicting Yuichi and one of the five heroines having [[sexual intercourse]]. While the original intention of ''Kanon'' was to contain these scenes, this comprised ten percent of the entire game's scenes. [[Key (company)|Key's]] objective was for the player to focus on the story and characters themselves, as opposed to ultimately finishing each of the separate storylines in order to view the sex scenes.

===Console ports===
For the [[Dreamcast]] and [[PlayStation 2]] console ports of ''Kanon'' new material was added to make up for the removal of the [[Hentai|H-scenes]]. A new heroine with her own story named Rumi Nanase was included.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://img134.imageshack.us/img134/2420/11506298568104ceda7b336tc6.jpg|title=Image of Rumi Nanase from ''Kanon''|accessdate=2007-03-07}}</ref> Rumi appeared in the background of some scenes at school in the original game, but she did not interact with anyone. Rumi was taken from the visual novel ''[[One: Kagayaku Kisetsu e]]'' which was made by the same team that made ''Kanon'', though this was while working with [[Tactics (company)|Tactics]]. Rumi is in the same class as Yuichi which is how they meet.

==Release history==
[[Image:Kanon original game cover.gif|thumb|200px|right|Original video game cover.]]
''Kanon'' was first introduced to the public in Japan on [[June 4]] [[1999]], playable only for the [[IBM PC compatible|PC]] as a [[CD-ROM]]. It retailed for 8,800 [[Japanese yen|yen]] (~[[United States dollar|US$]]74.18) prior to tax.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.getchu.com/soft.phtml?id=97|title=Getchu.com on Kanon's original release|accessdate=2007-01-06|language=Japanese}}</ref> The next year was followed by two separate releases: an all-ages version released on [[January 7]] [[2000]] and the first consumer console port of the game for the [[Sega Dreamcast]] on [[September 14]] [[2000]]. The second consumer port for the [[PlayStation 2]] was released on [[February 28]] [[2002]], retailing for 7,140 yen (~US$60.22), and featured different cover art for the disk case. After the PS2 game sold enough units, two years later on [[December 22]] [[2004]], a cheaper version for the PS2 also known as the "Best Version" went on sale for 3,129 yen (~US$26.39).

The ''Kanon'' Standard Edition was released on [[November 26]] [[2004]] with added support for [[Windows 2000]]/[[Windows XP|XP]] as a [[DVD-ROM]]. Only this version and the original release contained pornographic scenes. Three months later on [[January 28]] [[2005]], the same game was released with the [[hentai]] content removed. The Standard Edition retailed for 2,800 yen (~US$23.61) before tax.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://key.visualarts.gr.jp/product/index.htm|title=List of Key products|accessdate=2007-01-02|language=Japanese}}</ref> Lastly, a [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]] version of the game went on sale in Japan on [[February 15]] [[2007]] retailing at 4,800 yen (~US$40.21) before tax. The first release of the PSP version came with a special DVD featuring a message from five of the voice actors and a recompiled opening video from the video game version.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.prot.co.jp/psp/kanon/index.html|title=Prototype's website on the Kanon PSP visual novel|accessdate=2007-01-24}}</ref> The five voice actors on the DVD included: [[Mariko K<U+014D>da]] as Nayuki Minase, [[Akemi Sat<U+014D>]] as Shiori Misaka, [[Mayumi Iizuka]] as Makoto Sawatari, [[Y<U+016B>ko Minaguchi]] as Akiko Minase, and [[Tomokazu Sugita]] as Yuichi Aizawa.

In fact, Ayu "has had more appearances outside of the original ''Kanon'' than any other anime or [[Eroge|H-game]] character ever," states the ''Kanon'' information page on the website hentai.co.uk.<ref name="hentai.co.uk">{{citeweb|url=http://www.hentai.co.uk/articles/kanon_information_and_synopsis.html|title=Kanon information and synopsis at hentai.co.uk|accessdate=2007-01-02}}</ref>

Five days before the first PS2 release for ''Kanon'', a PlayStation 2 printer called Tapis MPR-505 went on sale which enabled the user to print out game screens. ''Kanon'' was one of the three games supported at launch, the other two being ''[[America <U+014C>den Ultra Quiz]]'' from [[DigiCube]] and ''[[Marle de Jigsaw]]'' from [[Nippon Ichi Software]].<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.allrpg.com/cgi-bin/news/archives.cgi?category=1&view=1-02|title=Allrpg.com's news archive for January 2002|accessdate=2007-01-09}}</ref>

===Novels===
There have been five [[novel]]s written by [[Mariko Shimizu]] and published by [[Paradigm (publisher)|Paradigm]] which were released in Japan between December 1999 and August 2000. The basis for each novel was one of each of the five heroines and had titles that were taken from the musical themes pertaining to each character in the original game. The first released was {{Nihongo|''Girl in the Snow''|<U+96EA><U+306E><U+5C11><U+5973>|Yuki no Sh<U+014D>jo|Nayuki}}, in December 1999. Later that same month {{Nihongo|''Beyond the Smile''|<U+7B11><U+9854><U+306E><U+5411><U+3053><U+3046><U+5074><U+306B>|Egao no Mukougawa ni|Shiori}} was released becoming the  second in the series. The third was {{Nihongo|''Girl's Prison''|<U+5C11><U+5973><U+306E><U+6ABB>|Sh<U+014D>jo no Ori|Mai}} released in April 2000 and the fourth novel was entitled ''the fox and the grapes'' Makoto, released two months later. The final novel entitled {{Nihongo|''A Sunny City''|<U+65E5><U+6E9C><U+308A><U+306E><U+8857>|Hidamari no Machi|Ayu}} was released in August 2000.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.amazon.co.jp/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/250-6868988-3935406?%5Fencoding=UTF8&search-type=ss&index=books-jp&field-author=%E6%B8%85%E6%B0%B4%20%E3%83%9E%E3%83%AA%E3%82%B3|title=Amazon.co.jp on Mariko Shimizu's works available for purchase|accessdate=2007-01-01|language=Japanese}}</ref> While the novels contained no illustrations within, the cover art was drawn by [[Itaru Hinoue]], the artist who drew the artwork in the visual novel.

===Drama CDs===
There were [[drama CD]]s released based on ''Kanon''. There are three complete sets of five CDs each, making the complete total fifteen, which were released over the course of three years between [[September 29]] [[2000]] and [[April 26]] [[2003]].<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.cdjapan.co.jp/Listups/anime/kanon.html|title=cdjapan.co.jp listing Kanon products|accessdate=2007-01-25}}</ref> The first two sets focused on each heroine separately per CD where the cover of the album would depict which of the girls was to be presented. The third set did not follow this format and Akiko Minase was depicted on the cover of the albums in this set.

===Manga===
[[Image:Kanon manga vol. 1 cover.jpg|143px|thumb|right|''Kanon'' manga volume 1.]]
A ''Kanon'' manga was first serialized in the Japanese manga magazine ''[[Dengeki Daioh]]'' in December 2000, running until July 2002.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.smashedice.com/kanon/manga/manga20236.JPG|title=Image of the copyright page from the second Kanon manga volume|accessdate=2007-03-13|language=Japanese}}</ref> The individual chapters were later collected into two separate [[tank<U+014D>bon|volumes]] published by [[MediaWorks (publisher)|MediaWorks]]. The story was adapted from the visual novel version that preceded it, and was illustrated by [[Petit Morishima]]. There were six chapters in total, three in each volume. Aside from the [[prologue]] in volume one and the [[epilogue]] in volume two, the other four chapters concern four of the main heroines. From chapters one through four, the main heroines presented are: Shiori Misaka, Makoto Sawatari, Mai Kawasumi and Ayu Tsukimiya. To make up for Nayuki not getting a chapter of her own, the story is altered in that Nayuki is in most of the scenes Yuichi is in.<ref name="kanonmanga1"/><ref name="kanonmanga2"/>

The manga is different than the visual novel in that Shiori's, Makoto's, and Mai's stories are not told in their entirety. Near the end of each of these girls' stories were originally intended to give the viewer the remaining answers, but the manga version ends these girls' stories prematurely.<ref name="kanonmanga1">{{cite book|last=Morishima|first=Petit|title=Kanon manga volume 1|publisher=[[MediaWorks (publisher)|MediaWorks]]|accessdate=2007-03-13}}</ref><ref name="kanonmanga2">{{cite book|last=Morishima|first=Petit|title=Kanon manga volume 2|publisher=[[MediaWorks (publisher)|MediaWorks]]|accessdate=2007-03-13}}</ref> This was due to the manga putting more focus on Ayu's story.

===Anime===
''Kanon'' was first adapted into an anime in 2002, followed by a single [[OVA]] in 2003, and finally a separate adaptation created in 2006. With the conclusion of the second anime adaptation, there are thirty-eight episodes related to the ''Kanon'' anime. 
{{further|[[List of Kanon episodes]]}}

====2002 original====
The first ''Kanon'' anime was made by the Japanese animation studio [[Toei Animation]] and aired in Japan on [[January 30]] [[2002]], spanning a total of 13 episodes. Later, a single OVA was released on [[May 3]] [[2003]] called ''Kanon Kazahana''. The original anime used the songs "florescence" and "flower" for the opening and ending themes respectively. While it did not appear as the ending theme in the first twelve episodes or in the OVA, the game's ending theme "Kaze no Tadoritsuku Basho" was used as the ending theme for the series in episode thirteen.<ref name="2002anime13">{{cite video|title=Original Kanon episode 13|medium=Anime|publisher=[[Toei Animation]]|date=[[March 27]] [[2002]]|accessdate=2007-03-13|language=Japanese}}</ref> Additionally, the game's opening theme "Last regrets" is played near the end of episode thirteen during the flashback scene.<ref name="2002anime13"/>

====2006 remake====
[[Kyoto Animation]], the animators of another [[Key (company)|Key]] game-turned-anime, ''[[Air (anime)|Air]]'', decided to animate their version of ''Kanon''. This 2006 version aired between [[October 5]] [[2006]] and [[March 15]] [[2007]] on the Japanese television broadcasting station [[BS-i]].

In a magazine published interview, studio producers stated that the primary reason for considering a ''Kanon'' remake was largely in part due to Kyoto's ''Air'' anime being well-received by viewers. In the second episode of ''Air'', in fact, the studio procured the rights and the original voice actors to give Ayu, Nayuki and Makoto a cameo as [[List of Air characters#Main characters|Kano Kirishima]]'s school friends. Consequently, Kyoto Animation received numerous phone calls from viewers expressing their desire for the studio to animate ''Kanon''.

The 2006 ''Kanon'' animation features the same [[seiy<U+016B>|voice acting]] cast as the original version released in 2002, with the exception of Yuichi and Kuze. This version is longer: twenty-four episodes instead of the previous thirteen. Unlike the original anime, the actual theme songs from the ''Kanon'' game are used for the anime remake's opening theme, ending theme and soundtrack. There is one song featured as an insert song in episode sixteen that did not come from the visual novel. It was entitled "Last regrets -X'mas floor style-" from [[I've Sound]]'s first album ''Regret''. Other songs are used from the [[Arrangement|arrange]] albums released over the years, such as ''[[List of Kanon soundtracks#Kanon original arrange album "anemoscope"|Anemoscope]]'', ''[[List of Kanon soundtracks#Kanon arrange best album "recollections"|Recollections]]'' and ''[[List of Kanon soundtracks#Kanon Air Piano Arrange Album Re-feel|Re-feel]]''.

==Music==
{{main|List of Kanon soundtracks}}
Nine official [[album]]s and a single released related to the ''Kanon'' series were released. Of the nine albums, six were for the video game version, two were for the original anime adaptation and the last was for the anime remake. The first album entitled ''[[List of Kanon soundtracks#Kanon original arrange album "anemoscope"|Anemoscope]]'' came with the limited edition box of the first ''Kanon'' release. Of the twelve songs on that CD, ten were [[Arrangement|arranged]] versions of songs from the game and the last two were the full-length opening and ending theme songs. From the nine albums for the video game, this only amounts to twenty-four separate songs which were either presented in their original versions or remixed in arranged, [[instrumental]] or in two albums, piano versions. One remix album entitled ''[[List of Kanon soundtracks#Orgel de Kiku TV Animation Han Kanon Sakuhin Sh<U+016B>|Orgel de Kiku TV Animation Han Kanon Sakuhin Sh<U+016B>]]'' presented fifteen songs from the original anime in [[music box]] versions.
