The '''Alpine Chough''' ({{pronEng|<U+02C8>t<U+0283><U+028C>f}}), or '''Yellow-billed Chough''', (''Pyrrhocorax graculus'') is a [[bird]] in the [[crow]] family, one of only two species in the genus ''Pyrrhocorax''. Its two [[subspecies]] breed in high mountains from [[Spain]] east through southern Europe and [[North Africa]] to [[Central Asia]], India and China, and it may nest at a higher altitude than any other bird. The eggs have adaptations to the thin atmosphere that improve oxygen take-up and reduce water loss.

This bird has glossy black [[plumage]], a yellow bill, red legs, and distinctive calls. It has a buoyant acrobatic flight with widely spread [[flight feather]]s. The Alpine Chough [[pair bond|pairs]] for life and displays [[philopatry|fidelity]] to its breeding site, which is usually a cave or crevice in a cliff face. It builds a lined stick nest and lays three to five brown-blotched whitish eggs. It feeds, usually in flocks, on short grazed grassland, taking mainly [[invertebrate]] prey in summer and fruit in winter; it will readily approach tourist sites to find supplementary food.

Although it is subject to predation and parasitism, and changes in agricultural practices have caused local population declines, this widespread and abundant species is not threatened globally. Climate change may present a long-term threat, by shifting the necessary alpine habitat to higher altitudes.

The subspecies ''P.&nbsp;g.&nbsp;digitatus'' averages slightly larger than the nominate form, weighing 191&ndash;244&nbsp;grams (6.8&ndash;8.7&nbsp;oz) against 188&ndash;252&nbsp;g (6.7&ndash;9.0&nbsp;oz) for ''P.&nbsp;g.&nbsp;graculus'', and it has stronger feet.<ref name= Madge94/><ref name=BWP/> This is in accordance with [[Bergmann's rule]], which predicts that the  largest birds should be found higher elevations or in colder and more arid regions.

Temperature seemed to be the most important cause of body variation in the Alpine Chough.<ref name ="  Ecogeographic" >{{cite journal | last= Laiolo | first=Paola  | coauthors = Rolando, Antonio| month= | year= 2000 | title= Ecogeographic correlates of morphometric variation in the Red-billed Chough ''Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax ''and the Alpine Chough ''Pyrrhocorax graculus''  | journal= Ibis | volume= 43  | issue = 3 | pages= 602&ndash;616 | url = |format = | doi = 10.1111/j.1474-919X.2001.tb04888.x  }}</ref>

The flight of the Alpine Chough is swift and acrobatic with loose deep wing beats. Its high manoeuvrability is accomplished by fanning the tail, folding its wings, and soaring in the [[Vertical draft|updraughts]] at cliff faces. Even in flight, it can be distinguished from Red-billed Chough by its less rectangular wings, and longer, less square-ended tail.<ref name= BWP/><ref name= burton>{{cite book |last = Burton |first = Robert |coauthors = |title = Bird behaviour| year = 1985 | page = 22 |location=London |publisher = Granada |isbn = 0246124407 }}</ref>

The [[trill (music)|rippling]] ''preep'' and whistled ''sweeeooo'' calls of the Alpine Chough are quite different from the more typically [[crow|crow-like]] ''chee-ow'' vocalisations of the Jackdaw and the Red-billed Chough. It also has a rolling ''churr'' [[alarm signal|alarm call]], and a variety of quiet warbles and squeaks given by resting or feeding birds.<ref name= Madge94/> In a study of chough calls throughout the [[Palearctic ecozone|Palearctic region]] it was found that call [[audio frequency|frequencies]] in the Alpine Chough showed an [[inverse relationship]] between body size and frequency, being higher-pitched in smaller-bodied populations.<ref name=Laiolo2001>{{cite journal |author= Laiolo, Paola | coauthors= Rolando, Antonio; Delestrade, Anne; de Sanctis, Augusto |year= 2001| title= Geographical variation in the calls of the choughs |journal= The Condor |volume= 103 |issue= 2 |pages= 287&ndash;297|url= http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1650/0010-5422(2001)103%5B0287%3AGVITCO%5D2.0.CO%3B2 |doi= 10.1650/0010-5422(2001)103[0287:GVITCO]2.0.CO;2}}</ref>

==Distribution and habitat==
[[File:Picos393.JPG|thumb|alt= high grey bare cliffs behind a meadow|Cliffs with nearby alpine pasture provide nesting sites.]]
The Alpine Chough breeds in mountains from Spain eastwards through southern Europe and the [[Alps]] across [[Central Asia]] and the [[Himalayas]] to western China. There are also populations in [[Morocco]], [[Corsica]] and [[Crete]]. It is a [[bird migration|non-migratory resident]] throughout its range, although Moroccan birds have established a small colony near [[M<U+00E1>laga]] in southern Spain, and wanderers have reached [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Gibraltar]], [[Hungary]] and [[Cyprus]].<ref name= Madge94/> 

This is a high-altitude species normally breeding between {{convert|1260|-|2880|m|ft}} in Europe, {{convert|2880|-|3900|m|ft|abbr=on}} in Morocco, and {{convert|3500|-|5000|m|ft|abbr=on}} in the Himalayas.<ref name= Madge94/> It has nested at {{convert|6500|m|ft|abbr=on}}, higher than any other bird species,<ref name= bahn>{{cite journal | last= Bahn | first= H. | coauthors = Ab, A. | year= 1974 | title= The avian egg: incubation time and water loss | journal= The Condor | volume= 76 | issue=2  | pages= 147&ndash;152 | url = http://elibrary.unm.edu/sora/Condor/files/issues/v076n02/p0147-p0152.pdf |format = PDF | doi =10.2307/1366724 }}</ref> even surpassing the Red-billed Chough which has a diet less well adapted to the highest altitudes.<ref name =Rolando2/> It has been observed following mountaineers ascending [[Mount Everest]] at an altitude of {{convert|8200|m|ft|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite book|title=Nature's champions: the biggest, the fastest, the best |author= Silverstein Alvin; Silverstein, Virginia | publisher = Courier Dover Publications |year=2003 | isbn=0486428885| page= 17}}</ref> It usually nests in cavities and fissures on inaccessible rock faces, although locally it will use holes between rocks in fields,<ref name= Baumgart > {{de icon}} {{cite journal | last= Baumgart | first= W. | month= | year= 1967| title= Alpendohlenkoniein in Felssch<U+00E4>chten des Westbalkan | journal=Journal f<U+00FC>r Ornithologie | volume= 108  | pages= 341&ndash;345 | doi= 10.1007/BF01671883 }}</ref> and forages in open habitats such as [[alpine meadow]]s and [[scree|scree slope]]s to the [[tree line]] or lower, and in winter will often congregate around human settlements, [[ski resort]]s, hotels and other tourist facilities.<ref name= BWP/> Its penchant for waiting by hotel windows for food is popular with tourists, but less so with hotel owners.<ref name= goodwin/>

A study of three different European populations showed a mean clutch size of 3.6 eggs, producing 2.6 chicks, of which 1.9 fledged.

===Feeding===
[[File:Male Ciche.jpg|alt= A ski lift above a snow-covered ski centre|Ski resorts may provide supplementary food, but also destroy natural habitat.|thumb]]

This bird always forages in groups, which are larger in winter than summer, and have constant composition in each season. Where food resources are restricted, adults dominate young birds, and males outrank females.<ref name= delestradesty/> Foraging areas change altitudinally through the year, depending on climatic factors, food availability and food quality. During the breeding season, birds remain above the [[tree line]], although they may use food provided by tourists at refuges and picnic areas.<ref name= LaioloCarisio/> 

Movement to lower levels begins after the first snowfalls, and feeding by day is mainly in or near valley bottoms when the snow cover deepens, although the birds return to the mountains to roost. In March and April the choughs frequent villages at valley tops or forage in snow-free patches prior to their return to the high meadows.<ref name= LaioloCarisio>{{cite journal | last= Laiolo | first= Paola | coauthors = Rolando, Antonio.; Carisio, Lorendana | month= | year= | title= Winter movements of the Alpine Chough: implications for management in the Alps | journal= Journal of Mountain Ecology | volume= 6 |pages= 21&ndash;30 | url = http://www.mountainecology.org/IBEX6/pdf/LAIOLO.pdf |format = PDF | doi = }}</ref> Feeding trips may cover {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} distance and {{convert|1600|m|ft|abbr=on}} in altitude.

Where their ranges overlap, the two chough species may feed together in the summer, although there is only limited competition for food. An Italian study showed that the vegetable part of the winter diet for the Red-billed Chough was almost exclusively ''[[Gagea]]'' bulbs dug from the ground, whilst the Alpine Chough took berries and hips. In June, Red-billed Choughs fed mainly on caterpillars whereas Alpine Choughs ate [[crane fly]] [[pupa]]e. Later in the summer, the Alpine Chough consumed large numbers of grasshoppers, while the Red-billed Chough added cranefly pupae, fly larvae and beetles to its diet.<ref name= Rolando2>{{cite journal|last= Rolando |first= Antonio |coauthors= Laiolo, Paola |month= April |year=1997 |title= A comparative analysis of the diets of the chough ''Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax'' and the alpine chough ''Pyrrhocorax graculus'' coexisting in the Alps |journal= Ibis | volume=139 |issue=2 |pages=388&ndash;395 |doi= 10.1111/j.1474-919X.1997.tb04639.x }}</ref>  In the eastern Himalayas in November, Alpine Choughs occur mainly in [[juniper]] forests where they feed on [[Juniper berry|juniper berries]], differing ecologically from the Red-billed Choughs in the same region and at the same time of year, which feed by digging in the soil of terraced pastures of villages.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Laiolo, Paola|coauthors= |year= 2003|title= Ecological and behavioural divergence by foraging Red-billed ''Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax'' and Alpine Choughs ''P. graculus'' in the Himalayas|url= http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=15605736  |journal= Ardea |volume= 91 |issue= 2 |pages= 273&ndash;277 }} (abstract)</ref>

Choughs can be locally threatened by the accumulation of [[pesticide]]s and [[heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metals]] in the mountain soils, heavy rain, shooting and other human disturbances,<ref name= Stoyanov/> but a longer-term threat comes from [[global warming]], which would cause the species' preferred [[Alpine climate]] zone to shift to higher, more restricted areas, or locally to disappear entirely.<ref name= Sekercioglu>{{cite journal | last= Sekercioglu | first= Cagan H | coauthors=  Schneider, Stephen H.; Fay, John P.
