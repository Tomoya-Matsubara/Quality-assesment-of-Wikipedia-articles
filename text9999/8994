'''Global warming''' is the rise in the average temperature  of Earth's atmosphere and oceans since the late 19th century and its projected continuation. Since the early 20th century, Earth's mean surface temperature has increased by about {{convert|0.8|C-change|F-change|1}}, with about two-thirds of the increase occurring since 1980.<ref name = "AmericasClimateChoices-2011-FullReport">

While much remains to be learned, the core phenomenon, scientific questions, and hypotheses have been examined thoroughly and have stood firm in the face of serious scientific debate and careful evaluation of alternative explanations. * * * (p21-22) Some scientific conclusions or theories have been so thoroughly examined and tested, and supported by so many independent observations and results, that their likelihood of subsequently being found to be wrong is vanishingly small. Such conclusions and theories are then regarded as settled facts. This is the case for the conclusions that the Earth system is warming and that much of this warming is very likely due to human activities.

Emission scenarios, combined with modelling of the [[carbon cycle]], have been used to produce estimates of how atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases might change in the future.

{{Main|Solar variation|Solar wind}}

Since 1978, [[solar variation|output from the Sun]] has been precisely measured by [[satellite]]s.<ref>
{{harvnb|US NRC|2008|p=6}}
</ref> These measurements indicate that the Sun's output has not increased since 1978, so the warming during the past 30 years cannot be attributed to an increase in solar energy reaching the Earth. In the three decades since 1978, the combination of solar and [[volcanic activity]] probably had a slight cooling influence on the climate.<ref>Global Climate Change, in {{Harvnb|USGCRP|2009|pp=15<U+2013>16}}

</ref> Models are unable to reproduce the rapid warming observed in recent decades when they only take into account variations in solar output and volcanic activity. Models are, however, able to simulate the observed 20th century changes in temperature when they include all of the most important external forcings, including human influences and natural forcings.

Another line of evidence against the sun having caused recent climate change comes from looking at how temperatures at different levels in the Earth's atmosphere have changed.<ref>{{cite web

A [[climate model]] is a [[mathematical models|computerized representation]] of the five components of the climate system: [[Earth's Atmosphere|Atmosphere]], [[hydrosphere]], [[cryosphere]], land surface, and [[biosphere]].<ref>IPCC, [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/syr/en/annexessglossary-a-d.html Glossary A-D]: "Climate Model", in {{Harvnb|IPCC AR4 SYR|2007}}.</ref> Such models are based on scientific disciplines such as [[fluid dynamics]], [[thermodynamics]] as well as physical processes such as [[radiative transfer]]. The models take into account various components, such as local air movement, temperature, clouds, and other atmospheric properties; ocean temperature, [[salinity|salt content]], and [[ocean circulation|circulation]]; ice cover on land and sea; the transfer of heat and moisture from soil and vegetation to the atmosphere; chemical and biological processes; solar variability and others.

Although researchers attempt to include as many processes as possible, simplifications of the actual climate system are inevitable because of the constraints of available computer power and limitations in knowledge of the climate system. Results from models can also vary due to different greenhouse gas inputs and the model's climate sensitivity. For example, the uncertainty in IPCC's 2007 projections is caused by (1) the use of multiple models<ref name="meehl 2007 global warming projections">

Models are also used to help investigate the [[Attribution of recent climate change|causes of recent climate change]] by comparing the observed changes to those that the models project from various natural and human-derived causes. Although these models do not unambiguously attribute the warming that occurred from approximately 1910 to 1945 to either natural variation or human effects, they do indicate that the warming since 1970 is dominated by man-made greenhouse gas emissions.<ref name=Hegerl-2001/>

The physical realism of models is tested by examining their ability to simulate contemporary or past climates.<ref>Randall ''et al.'', [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch8.html Chapter 8, Climate Models and Their Evaluation], Sec.

|quote=Recently analyzed satellite-derived global precipitation datasets from 1987 to 2006 indicate an increase in global-mean precipitation of 1.1%<U+2013>1.4% decade<U+2212>1. This trend corresponds to a hydrological sensitivity (HS) of 7% K<U+2212>1 of global warming, which is close to the Clausius<U+2013>Clapeyron (CC) rate expected from the increase in saturation water vapor pressure with temperature. Analysis of two available global ocean evaporation datasets confirms this observed intensification of the atmospheric water cycle. The observed hydrological sensitivity over the past 20-yr period is higher by a factor of 5 than the average HS of 1.4% K<U+2212>1 simulated in state-of-the-art coupled atmosphere<U+2013>ocean climate models for the twentieth and twenty-first centuries.

== Proposed policy responses to global warming ==
There are different views over what the appropriate policy response to climate change should be.<ref>Banuri, ''et al.'', Chapter 3: Equity and Social Considerations, Section 3.1.2: Concepts of equity,
[http://www.ipcc.ch/ipccreports/sar/wg_III/ipcc_sar_wg_III_full_report.pdf p. 85 ''et seq.''] in {{Harvnb|IPCC SAR WG3|1996}}.</ref>
These competing views weigh the benefits of limiting emissions of greenhouse gases against the costs. In general, it seems likely that climate change will impose greater damages and risks in poorer regions.<ref>Banuri, ''et al.'', Chapter 3: Equity and Social Considerations, Section ??, [http://www.ipcc.ch/ipccreports/sar/wg_III/ipcc_sar_wg_III_full_report.pdf p. 83], in {{Harvnb|IPCC SAR WG3|1996}}.</ref>

=== Adaptation ===
{{main|Adaptation to global warming}}
Other policy responses include [[adaptation to global warming|adaptation]] to climate change. Adaptation to climate change may be planned, either in reaction to or anticipation of climate change, or spontaneous, i.e., without government intervention.<ref>Smit ''et al.'', [http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg2/641.htm Chapter 18: Adaptation to Climate Change in the Context of Sustainable Development and Equity], [http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg2/644.htm#1823 Section 18.2.3: Adaptation Types and Forms], in {{Harvnb|IPCC TAR WG2|2001}}.</ref> Planned adaptation is already occurring on a limited basis.<ref name="autogenerated2007"/> The barriers, limits, and costs of future adaptation are not fully understood.<ref name="autogenerated2007"/>

A concept related to adaptation is "[[adaptive capacity]]", which is the ability of a system (human, natural or managed) to adjust to climate change (including climate variability and extremes) to moderate potential damages, to take advantage of opportunities, or to cope with consequences.<ref>

{{Main|climate change denial|global warming controversy}}

The [[global warming controversy]] refers to a variety of disputes, substantially more pronounced in the [[Media coverage of climate change|popular media]] than in the scientific literature,<ref>{{cite doi | 10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2003.10.001}}</ref><ref name="merchants_doubt">{{cite book | title=Merchants of Doubt: How a Handful of Scientists Obscured the Truth on Issues from Tobacco Smoke to Global Warming | first1=Naomi | last1=Oreskes | author1-link = Naomi Oreskes| first2=Erik | last2=Conway | publisher=Bloomsbury Press | edition=first | isbn=978-1-59691-610-4}}</ref> regarding the nature, causes, and consequences of global warming. The disputed issues include the causes of increased [[instrumental temperature record|global average air temperature]], especially since the mid-20th century, whether this warming trend is unprecedented or within normal climatic variations, whether [[attribution of recent climate change|humankind has contributed significantly to it]], and whether the increase is wholly or partially an artifact of poor measurements. Additional disputes concern estimates of [[climate sensitivity]], predictions of additional warming, and what the consequences of global warming will be.

From 1990<U+2013>1997 in the United States, [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] think tanks mobilized to undermine the legitimacy of global warming as a social problem. They [[climate change denial|challenged the scientific evidence]], argued that global warming will have benefits, and asserted that proposed solutions would do more harm than good.<ref>Aaron M. McCright and Riley E. Dunlap, "Challenging Global Warming as a Social Problem: An Analysis of the Conservative Movement's Counter-Claims," ''Social Problems,'' November 2000, Vol. 47 Issue 4, pp 499<U+2013>522 [http://www.jstor.org/pss/3097132 in JSTOR]</ref>

==== Surveys of public opinion ====
{{main|Public opinion on climate change}}

Researchers at the University of Michigan have found that the public's belief as to the causes of global warming depends on the [[Opinion poll#Wording of questions|wording choice used in the polls]].<ref>{{cite web|title=It's All in a Name: 'Global Warming' Vs. 'Climate Change'|url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/03/110308173242.htm}}</ref>

In 2007<U+2013>2008 [[Gallup Poll]]s surveyed 127 countries. Over a third of the world's population was unaware of global warming, with people in developing countries less aware than those in [[Developed country|developed]], and those in Africa the least aware. Of those aware, Latin America leads in belief that temperature changes are a result of human activities while Africa, parts of Asia and the Middle East, and a few countries from the Former Soviet Union lead in the opposite belief.<ref>

By 2010, with 111 countries surveyed, Gallup determined that there was a substantial decrease in the number of Americans and Europeans who viewed global warming as a serious threat. In the US, a little over half the population (53%) now viewed it as a serious concern for either themselves or their families; this was 10% below the 2008 poll (63%).

A March<U+2013>May 2013 survey by [[Pew Research Center for the People & the Press]] polled 39 countries about global threats.

== Etymology ==
The term ''global warming'' was probably first used in its modern sense on 8 August 1975 in a science paper by [[Wally Broecker]] in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' called "Are we on the brink of a pronounced global warming?".<ref>{{cite news | author=Stefan | title = Happy 35th birthday, global warming! | url = http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2010/07/happy-35th-birthday-global-warming/ | publisher=[[RealClimate]] | date = 28 July 2010 | accessdate =10 August 2010 | quote = [Broecker's article is] the first of over 10,000 papers for this search term according to the ISI database of journal articles}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | last = Johnson | first = Brad | title = Wally's World | url = http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2010/08/03/wallys_world | work=[[Foreign Policy (magazine)|Foreign Policy]] | date = 3 August 2010 | accessdate =10 August 2010}}</ref><ref>Wallace Broecker, "Climatic Change: Are We on the Brink of a Pronounced Global Warming?" Science, vol. 189 (8 August 1975), 460<U+2013>463.</ref> Broecker's choice of words was new and represented a significant recognition that the climate was warming; previously the phrasing used by scientists was "inadvertent climate modification," because while it was recognized humans could change the climate, no one was sure which direction it was going.<ref name=nasacbaon>[[Erik M. Conway|Erik Conway]]. [http://www.nasa.gov/topics/earth/features/climate_by_any_other_name.html "What's in a Name? Global Warming vs. Climate Change"], NASA, 5 December 2008</ref> The National Academy of Sciences first used ''global warming'' in a 1979 paper called the Charney Report, which said: "if carbon dioxide continues to increase, [we find] no reason to doubt that climate changes will result and no reason to believe that these changes will be negligible."<ref>National Academy of Science, Carbon Dioxide and Climate, Washington, D.C., 1979, p. vii.</ref> The report made a distinction between referring to surface temperature changes as ''global warming'', while referring to other changes caused by increased CO<sub>2</sub> as ''climate change''.<ref name=nasacbaon/>

''Global warming'' became more widely popular after 1988 when NASA climate scientist [[James Hansen]] used the term in a testimony to Congress.<ref name=nasacbaon/> He said: "global warming has reached a level such that we can ascribe with a high degree of confidence a cause and effect relationship between the greenhouse effect and the observed warming."<ref>U.S. Senate, Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, "Greenhouse Effect and Global Climate Change, part 2" 100th Cong., 1st sess., 23 June 1988, p. 44.</ref> His testimony was widely reported and afterward ''global warming'' was commonly used by the press and in public discourse.<ref name=nasacbaon/>
