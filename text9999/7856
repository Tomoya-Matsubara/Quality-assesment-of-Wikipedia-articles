She was known primarily for her rough powerful [[human voice|vocals]] and traditional blues stylings.  

==Life and career==
Born '''Cora Walton''' in [[Shelby County, Tennessee|Shelby County]], [[Tennessee]], Taylor left [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] for [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]], [[Illinois]] in 1952 with her husband, truck driver Robert "Pops" Taylor.<ref name="obit" /> In the late 1950s she began singing in [[Chicago blues]] clubs. She was spotted by [[Willie Dixon]] in 1962, and this led to wider performances and her first [[recording contract]]. In 1965, Taylor was signed by [[Chess Records]], for which her [[single (music)|single]] "Wang Dang Doodle" (written by Dixon, and a [[chart-topper|hit]] for [[Howlin' Wolf]] five years earlier), featuring guitarist [[Little Walter]],<ref>[http://www.lastingtribute.co.uk/tribute/taylor/3090604 Lastingtribute.co.uk]</ref> became a major hit, reaching number four on the R&B charts in 1966, and selling a million copies.<ref name="obit" /> Taylor [[sound recording and reproduction|recorded]] many versions of this Dixon-penned song over the past few decades and has added more material, both original and [[cover version|covers]], but never repeated that initial [[record chart|chart]] success.

National touring in the late 1960s and early 1970s improved her [[fan (person)|fan]] base, and she became accessible to a wider record-buying public when she signed with [[Alligator Records]] in 1975. She recorded nine albums for Alligator, 8 of which were Grammy-nominated), and come to dominate the female blues singer ranks, winning twenty five [[Blues Music Award|W. C. Handy Award]]s (more than any other artist). After her recovery from a near-fatal [[Traffic collision|car crash]] in 1989, the 1990s found Taylor in [[film]]s such as ''[[Blues Brothers 2000]]'', and she opened a blues [[nightclub|club]] on [[Division Street (Chicago)|Division Street]] in Chicago in 1994, but it closed in 1999.

Taylor influenced musicians such as [[Bonnie Raitt]], [[Shemekia Copeland]], [[Janis Joplin]], [[Shannon Curfman]], and [[Susan Tedeschi]].  In the years prior to her death, she performed over 70 concerts a year and resided just south of Chicago in [[Country Club Hills, Illinois]].

In 2008, the [[Internal Revenue Service]] said that Taylor owed $400,000 in back taxes, penalties and interest. Her tax problems concerned 1998, 2000 and 2001; for those years combined, her adjusted gross income was $949,000.<ref>{{cite news |title=Singing Tax Blues |author=Janet Novack and William P.
