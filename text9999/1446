==History==
[[Image:Carl Bechstein.jpg||thumb|upright|Carl Bechstein]]

===Before Bechstein===
Young [[Carl Bechstein]] studied and worked in France and England as a piano craftsman, before he became an independent piano maker. His first pianos were made for other companies.<ref name="Grove"/>

===C. Bechstein===
C. Bechstein piano factory was founded on 1 October 1853 by [[Carl Bechstein]] in Berlin, Germany.<ref name="Grove"/>

Carl Bechstein set out to manufacture a piano able to withstand the great demands imposed on the instrument by the virtuosi of the time, such as [[Franz Liszt]]. In 1857, [[Hans von B<U+00FC>low]] (Liszt's son-in-law) gave the first public performance on a Bechstein grand piano by performing Liszt's [[Piano Sonata (Liszt)|Piano Sonata in B minor]] in Berlin.<ref name="Grove" />

By 1870, with endorsements from Franz Liszt and Hans von B<U+00FC>low, Bechstein pianos had become a staple in many concert halls and private mansions. By that time three piano makers, all of which were founded in 1853, became established as the industry leaders across the world: Bechstein, [[Bl<U+00FC>thner]] and [[Steinway & Sons]].<ref name="Norton">{{cite book|last=Ehrlich|first=Cyril|title=The Piano|editor=Philip Belt|publisher=W.W.

The years from the 1870s through 1914 brought Bechstein their most dramatic increase in sales. In 1880 a second Bechstein factory was opened in Berlin,<ref name="Bechstein 1">{{cite web|url=http://www.bechstein.de/aboutbechstein/tradition/default.aspx|title=Tradition 1870-1889|publisher=Bechstein Official Website|accessdate=2009-04-25}}</ref> and the third factory was opened in 1897 in [[Kreuzberg|Berlin-Kreuzberg]].<ref name="Bechstein 2">{{cite web|url=http://www.bechstein.de/aboutbechstein/tradition/default.aspx|title=Tradition 1890-1909|date=2009|publisher=Bechstein Official Website|accessdate=2009-04-25}}</ref> Production reached 3700 pianos annually in 1900, and 4600 in 1910, making Bechstein the largest German manufacturer of high-end pianos.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ehrlich|first=Cyril|title=The Piano: A History|publisher=J.

Carl Bechstein died in 1900, and the Bechstein company continued to operate under the management of his sons.
[[Image:Bechstein10.jpg|thumb|left|Bechstein Art Nouveau grand piano, 1902]]
Between 1900 and 1914 C. Bechstein was one of the leading piano makers in the world, employing 1200 craftsmen and workers by 1913 and making five thousand pianos per year.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ehrlich|first=Cyril|title=The Piano: A History|publisher=J.

=== First World War ===
C. Bechstein suffered huge property losses in London, Paris, and St. Petersburg during World War I. The largest loss was in London. Although the company's position in the United Kingdom was initially unaffected, with the company still listed as holding a [[List of Royal Warrant holders of the British Royal Family|Royal Warrant]] in January 1915,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/29026/pages/30|title=London Gazette|date=1 January 1915|pages=30|accessdate=2009-04-25}}</ref> Warrants to both [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]], and his wife [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]] were cancelled on 13 April 1915.<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=29127|startpage=3577|date=13 April 1915|accessdate=2008-03-14}}</ref> Bechstein was not the only musical concern to be affected by growing anti-German sentiment: there were earlier attempts, led by [[William Boosey]], to boycott German music altogether. In 1915, despite being a [[Baronet]] and [[Privy Counsellor]], [[Edgar Speyer|Sir Edgar Speyer]], who was then funding [[the Proms]], was forced to leave the country.<ref>{{cite book

In 1916 the hall was sold as alien property at auction to [[Debenhams]] for <U+00A3>56,500. It was renamed [[Wigmore Hall]], and then re-opened under the new name in 1917. All 137 Bechstein pianos at the Bechstein showrooms were confiscated too, and became property of the new owner of the Hall.<ref name="Wigmore">{{cite web|url=http://www.wigmore-hall.org.uk/about-us/history|title=History|publisher=Wigmore Hall Official Website|accessdate=2009-04-25}}</ref>
After a dispute with his brother, Edwin Bechstein left the company and was paid off.{{Fact|date=April 2009}}

===Between the wars===
Eventually the Bechstein factory resumed full-scale production during the 1920s. At that time, technical innovations and inventions of new materials and tools, as well as improvements in piano design and construction, had allowed Bechstein to become one of the leading piano makers again.{{Fact|date=April 2009}}

The most successful models were the updated "A"-185 and "B"-208 grand pianos. The upright pianos became more popular after the war, and C. Bechstein were successful with its upright pianos Model-8 and Model-9, both of which have been considered the finest upright pianos.<ref>{{cite book

As the company was changed into a joint-stock company 1923, Edwin Bechstein and his wife Helene, bought themselves back into the company as shareholders.

In 1930 the company collaborated with German [[electrical]] goods manufacturer [[Siemens AG|Siemens]] under [[Nobel prize|Nobel laureate]] [[Walther Nernst]] to produce one of the first [[electric piano]]s, the "Neo-Bechstein" or "Siemens-Bechstein" [[Electric Grand Piano|electric grand]], using [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] [[Pick up (music technology)|pickup]]s.

Edwin Bechstein and his wife, Helene Bechstein, who was an ardent admirer of the [[Nazi]] leader [[Adolf Hitler]], bestowed many gifts on Hitler including his first luxury car, a red [[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes]] costing 26,000 marks.Helene Bechstein and her friend [[Elsa Bruckmann]] introduced Hitler to Germany<U+2019>s cultural elite in Berlin and Munich.<ref name="Chicago">{{cite news|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/2008/apr/30/business/chi-piano-war-0430apr30|title=WWII aftermath favored Steinway|last=Hundley|first=Tom|date=2008-04-30|publisher=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=2009-04-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Vases, Tea Sets, Cigars, His Own Watercolours|url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v31/n07/clar10_.html|first=Christopher|last=Clark|work=London Review of Books|date=2009-04-09|accessdate=2009-04-01}}</ref> "I wish he were my son," she said.<ref> Hitler Biographer Konrad Heiden: ''[http://www.nizkor.org/hweb/people/h/hitler-adolf/oss-papers/text/oss-sb-heiden-02.html]''.

After Edwin Bechstein died in 1934 in [[Berchtesgaden]], where he had a villa named "Bechstein" in a short distance to the [[Obersalzberg]], his body was transferred to Berlin. He was buried following a state funeral attended by Adolf Hitler and [[NSDAP]] politicians, including [[Wilhelm Frick]] and [[Max Amann]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Klee|first=Ernst|title=Das Kulturlexikon zum Dritten Reich : wer war was vor und nach 1945|publisher=S.

===Second World War===
In 1945, [[Bombing of Berlin in World War II|allied bombing raids]] destroyed the Bechstein piano factory in Berlin, along with the firm's stores of valuable wood, including the precious Alpine spruce used to make soundboards. The war also cost the company many of its experienced craftsmen. For several years after the war, Bechstein could not resume full-scale production of pianos and made only a few pianos per year.<ref name="Garland"/>

===After World War II===
After de-Nazification of the C.Bechstein Company, they started in 1948 to produce pianos again.<ref name="Chicago"/>
C. Bechstein eventually increased piano production to about a thousand pianos per year during the 1950s and '60s. However, the new economic situation in the post-war world was hard for the piano business. In 1961 the Bechstein piano factory was affected by the construction of the [[Berlin Wall]]. The ownership of C. Bechstein had changed several times.In 1963 all the shares were sold to the [[Baldwin Piano Company]]. Up until the [[reunification of Germany]], the company was making fewer pianos, although the quality of craftsmanship remained high. 

In 1953, the centennial of Bechstein was celebrated by the [[Berlin Philharmonic]] under [[Wilhelm Furtw<U+00E4>ngler]] and [[Wilhelm Backhaus]].<ref name="Bechstein 4">{{cite web|url=http://www.bechstein.de/aboutbechstein/tradition/default.aspx|title=1950-1969|date=2009|publisher=Bechstein Official Website|accessdate=2009-04-25}}</ref> Many entertainers and concert pianists, such as [[Leonard Bernstein]], [[Jorge Bolet]], and [[Wilhelm Kempff]], favored Bechstein pianos.<ref name="Bechstein 4"/> The State Ministry of Culture of the Soviet Union made a contract to supply major state philharmonic orchestras and concert halls across the USSR with three brands of pianos - [[Steinway & Sons]], Bluthner, and Bechstein. Bluthner and Bechstein were also made the staple practice pianos at the Leningrad Conservatory and Moscow Conservatory,{{Fact|date=April 2009}} while most other music schools of the USSR were limited mainly to the Soviet-made pianos. Concert pianists, such as [[Dinu Lipatti]], [[Shura Cherkassky]], [[Tatiana Nikolaeva]], [[Vladimir Sofronitsky]], and [[Sviatoslav Richter]], among others, often chose Bechstein pianos for their studio recordings.
{{Fact|date=April 2009}}

===After the fall of the Berlin Wall ===
1986 Karl Schulze, German entrepreneur and master piano maker, bought Bechstein and continued the legacy of fine piano making. Due to reunification of Germany and elimination of the [[Berlin Wall]], the land formerly belonging to the Bechstein factory was used for new construction in the capital. In 1992 Bechstein started a new factory in Saxony for C. Bechstein and Zimmermann instruments. With investment of 15 million Euros this manufacturing site has become one of the world's most state-of-the-art factory for premium class instruments.<ref name="bechtrad">http://www.bechstein.de/aboutbechstein/tradition/default.aspx</ref> Visitor groups are welcome.

In 1996 C. Bechstein went public. In 2003 Bechstein formed a partnership with [[Samick]], in order to improve overseas distribution, nowadays, after the successful capital increase in 2009,<ref>http://www.bechstein.de/upload/homepage/teaser/Press_release_Increase_in_capital-1_12-09.doc.pdf</ref> Samick no longer has any shares.{{fact|date=March 2010}}

By 2006 the company opened eight upscale showrooms and increased the number of Bechstein dealerships in major cities across Europe, North America and Asia. New Bechstein center were opened in recent years in New York, Moscow, Shanghai as well as partner centers in Kiew, Seoul, Sydney and the Netherlands.<ref name="bechtrad" />

In 2007 the new C.Bechstein Europe factory was opened in Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic. Bechstein has invested millions of Euros to build up a new, state-of-the-art manufacturing site especially for W. Hoffmann instruments. All brands and instruments made by C. Bechstein now exclusively originate from Europe.<ref>http://www.bechstein.de/upload/press/news/PM-FrankfurtEnglisch-BK-Internet.pdf</ref>

Along with the economic success [business reports] C. Bechstein concert grand pianos are making their comeback on international concert stages and to recording studios.<ref>http://www.bechstein-centren.de/ger/__3/unternehmen/meldungen</ref>

In 2006 the first international C. Bechstein Piano Competition took place under Vladimir Ashkenazy's patronate. National C. Bechstein competitions regularly foster the musical development of young artists.

===Artcase pianos===
Bechstein has been known as a maker of one-of-a-kind artcase pianos since the 19th century.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1997/10/05/magazine/keyboard-virtuoso.html|title=Keyboard Virtuoso|last=Trucco|first=Terry|date=1997-10-05|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=2009-04-25}}</ref> Artcase pianos were commissioned by interior designers for royal palaces and fancy mansions. Artists and craftsmen were hired by C. Bechstein to make special pianos decorated with gold, hand-carved details, and hand-painted art on the piano case. Some of the artcase Bechsteins are now museum pieces, while others are sometimes traded at musical-instrument auctions, mainly in London and New York.

==Performers==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2009}}
Students and followers of Hans von B<U+00FC>low and Franz Liszt also developed loyalty to Bechstein pianos.

[[Alexander Scriabin]] owned a concert-size Bechstein at his Moscow home, which is now a national museum, and Scriabin's piano is still played at scheduled recitals. [[Tatiana Nikolaeva]] preferred the Bechstein for her acclaimed recordings of the music of [[Bach]]. [[Sviatoslav Richter]] grew up studying piano on a Bechstein and remembered his experience with that piano as stimulating and rewarding.

For his studio recording of the music of [[Chopin]] and [[Beethoven]], [[Dinu Lipatti]] used a Bechstein piano.

[[Edwin Fischer]] chose a Bechstein piano for his pioneering recording of [[Bach]]'s [[Well Tempered Clavier]], as did [[Artur Schnabel]] for his cycle of [[Beethoven]]'s 32 piano sonatas. Both artists were very fond of Bechstein's pianos, as were many of last century's leading pianists, such as [[Wilhelm Kempff]] and [[Wilhelm Backhaus]].{{Fact|date=June 2007}}

[[Freddie Mercury]] of the British pop band [[Queen (band)|Queen]] played a Bechstein piano on the best-selling album ''[[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|A Night at the Opera]]''.

[[The Beatles]] used a Bechstein concert grand piano for recording [[Hey Jude]] and the ''[[The Beatles (album)|White Album]]'' tracks ''[[Dear Prudence]], [[Honey Pie]], [[Savoy Truffle]] and [[Martha My Dear]], [[I Want You (She's So Heavy)]] for the album [[Abbey Road]]'', all at [[Trident Studios]].

[[Elton John]] recorded "[[Your Song]]" and many other tracks on a handmade Bechstein concert-sized instrument that was over one hundred years old at Trident Studios in London. Its classic sound was much sought after.{{Fact|date=February 2010}}

[[Oscar Peterson]] played and owned a Bechstein throughout much of his career, publicity contracts with rival manufacturers notwithstanding.{{Fact|date=February 2010}}
