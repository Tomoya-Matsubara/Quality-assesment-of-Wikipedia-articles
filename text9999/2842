The '''1978 European Cup Final''' was an [[association football]] match between [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] of England and [[Club Brugge K.V.|Club Brugge]] of Belgium on 10 May 1978 at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]], London, England. It was the final match of the [[1977<U+2013>78 European Cup|1977<U+2013>78 season]] of Europe's premier cup competition, the European Cup. Liverpool were the reigning champions and were appearing in their second European Cup final. Club Brugge were appearing in their first European Cup final. The two sides had met once before in European competition, when they contested the [[1976 UEFA Cup Final]], which Liverpool won 4<U+2013>3 on aggregate.

As reigning champions, Liverpool received a bye in the first round, which meant that Club Brugge played two matches more to reach the final. All but one of Liverpool's matches were comfortable victories and they won each round with an aggregate score at least two goals to the good. In the first round Club Brugge beat Finnish champions [[Kuopion Palloseura]] by 9<U+2013>2 on aggregate, but they won each of their subsequent rounds by just one goal.

Watched by a crowd of 92,000, the first half was goalless. Liverpool took the lead in the second half when [[Kenny Dalglish]] scored from a [[Graeme Souness]] pass. They held this lead to win the match 1<U+2013>0, securing Liverpool's second European Cup and third European trophy in succession, and they became the first British team to retain the European Cup.

[[Club Brugge K.V.|Club Brugge]] gained entry to the competition by winning the [[1976<U+2013>77 Belgian First Division]] and thus becoming Belgian champions. Their opponents in the first round were the Finnish champions, [[Kuopion Palloseura]] (KuPS). Brugge won the first leg 4<U+2013>0 at KuPS's home ground, the [[Kuopion keskuskentt<U+00E4>]], and the second leg 5<U+2013>2 at Brugge's ground, the [[Jan Breydel Stadium]], thus winning the round 9<U+2013>2 on aggregate.<ref name="rsssf" />

Their opponents in the second round were Greek champions [[Panathinaikos FC|Panathinaikos]]. The first leg was in Belgium. Brugge won 2<U+2013>0 after [[Roger Davies (footballer)|Roger Davies]] scored from a penalty in the 24th minute and [[Julien Cools]] scored midway through the second half. The second leg was played at Panathinaikos' home ground, the [[Apostolos Nikolaidis Stadium]]. Panathinaikos won the match 1<U+2013>0, so Brugge won the round with an aggregate score of 2<U+2013>1.<ref name="rsssf" />

Brugge's opponents in the quarter-finals were Spanish champions [[Atl<U+00E9>tico Madrid]]. The first leg in Belgium was won 2<U+2013>0 by Brugge. The second leg, played at the [[Vicente Calder<U+00F3>n Stadium]], Atl<U+00E9>tico's home ground, was a close match: Atl<U+00E9>tico scored twice in the first half; Cools scored for Brugge in the 60th minute; [[Marcial Pina]] scored for Atl<U+00E9>tico two minutes later; finally [[Raoul Lambert]] scored once more for Brugge. Thus Brugge lost the match 3<U+2013>2 but won the round with a 4<U+2013>3 aggregate score.<ref name="rsssf" />

Italian champions [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] were the opponents in the semi-finals. The first leg, at the [[Stadio Olimpico di Torino]], Juventus' home ground, was goalless until the 86th minute, when [[Roberto Bettega]] scored to give Juventus a 1<U+2013>0 victory. The second leg in Belgium was a similarly close affair. Brugge scored in the third minute, but that left a 1<U+2013>1 aggregate score after 90 minutes, requiring [[Overtime (sports)|extra time]] to be played. Had the aggregate score still been tied after the extra time, there would have been a [[Penalty shootout (association football)|penalty shootout]], but [[Ren<U+00E9> Vandereycken]] scored in the 116th minute to give Brugge a 2<U+2013>0 win in the match and a 2<U+2013>1 win on aggregate, to progress to their first European Cup final.<ref name="rsssf" />

==Match==
===Summary===
[[File:Wem.jpg||thumb|200px|right|The final was held at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]], which had previously hosted three finals.]]
1978 was the first year in which Club Brugge had reached the final, while Liverpool were appearing in their second successive final. The two teams had met before in the final of a European competition: the [[1976 UEFA Cup Final]], which Liverpool won 4<U+2013>3 on aggregate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/ec/ec197576.html#uefa |title=UEFA Cup 1975<U+2013>76 |publisher=Rec. Sport. Soccer. Statistisc. Foundation |date=9 January 2008 |accessdate=24 April 2011 |first= James M. |last=Ross}}</ref> Liverpool were the reigning champions and were aiming to become the first British team to win successive European Cups. Liverpool had already won the [[UEFA Cup]] twice, in the [[1972<U+2013>73 UEFA Cup|1972<U+2013>73]] and [[1975<U+2013>76 UEFA Cup|1975<U+2013>76]] seasons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/history/honours |title=Honours |publisher=Liverpool F.C |accessdate=24 April 2011 }}</ref> Brugge were the first Belgian team to reach the final of the European Cup and thus were aiming to become the first to win the trophy.

As the final was held in England at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]], Liverpool were clear favourites to retain the European Cup.<ref name="Hale1">{{cite book |last=Hale |year=1992 |page=133 }}</ref> Brugge were without a number of key players, such as [[Raoul Lambert]], whose inclusion in the Brugge squad was rumoured before the final but never materialised.<ref name="guardian">{{cite news|url=http://www.lfchistory.net/Articles/Article/663 |title=Liverpool's tunes of glory |first=David |last=Lacey |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=10 May 1978 |accessdate=20 April 2011 }}</ref> Liverpool were also without a few players. [[Tommy Smith (footballer born 1945)|Tommy Smith]], who had scored in the previous season's final, was out after dropping a pick-axe on his foot and breaking a toe.<ref name="Hale1" /> Striker [[David Johnson (footballer born 1951)|David Johnson]] was also absent. He had strained knee ligaments during a match against [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]], an injury that ruled him out for the rest of the season.<ref name="Hale1" />

The first half was dull. Brugge held back, using tight [[Marking (association football)|marking]] and the [[offside trap]] to restrict Liverpool's attacking threat.<ref name="guardian" /> Towards the end of the fist half, Liverpool started to have more scoring chances. [[Alan Kennedy]] volleyed across the face of the goal, and [[Jimmy Case]] took a [[free kick]] that needed to be punched away by Brugge goalkeeper [[Birger Jensen]]. In the closing minutes of the first half, Jensen made two crucial saves: he blocked [[David Fairclough]], who had made a run towards goal, and he tipped a header by [[Alan Hansen]] over the crossbar. So the score at half-time was 0<U+2013>0.<ref name="guardian" />

Early in the second half, Jensen made another save, this time from [[Terry McDermott]]. Brugge's first significant chance came a few minutes afterwards, when a cross-field pass by [[Ren<U+00E9> Vandereycken]] reached [[Jan S<U+00F8>rensen]] on the right-hand side of the pitch. S<U+00F8>rensen's subsequent shot was blocked by Liverpool captain [[Emlyn Hughes]]. The blocked shot was not cleared, but [[Ray Clemence]] reached the ball before Brugge's [[Lajos K<U+0171>]] could reach it and score. After this K<U+0171> was substituted with Dirk Sanders. Liverpool made a substitution minutes later, with [[Steve Heighway]] replacing Case. Liverpool's substitution had more effect, as Heighway gave Liverpool more width on the right-hand side of the pitch.<ref name="guardian" /> Two minutes after Heighway's introduction, [[Kenny Dalglish]] received the ball in the Brugge penalty area from a [[Graeme Souness]] pass and placed his shot over a diving Jensen to give Liverpool a 1<U+2013>0 lead.<ref name="Hale1" />

Brugge now needed to score, but they only created one more chance. Ten minutes before the end of the match, S<U+00F8>rensen intercepted a Hansen backpass and shot. His shot was blocked by Clemence, and a goal-line clearance by [[Phil Thompson]] prevented Brugge from equalising.<ref name="Hale1" /> The match remained at 1<U+2013>0 and Liverpool won their second consecutive European Cup, becoming the first British team to retain the trophy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/history/timeline/1970-1995/wembley-glory-as-reds-beat-bruges |title=Wembley glory as Reds beat Bruges |publisher=Liverpool F.C |accessdate=24 April 2011 }}</ref>

After the match, figures from each team were critical of the other team's play. Liverpool defender Tommy Smith criticised Brugge for their approach, saying "It was a pathetic attitude. You never win anything like that."<ref name="Hale1" /> Liverpool manager [[Bob Paisley]] also criticised the Belgian team's tactics: "It takes two teams to make a game into a spectacle and Bruges only seemed to be concerned with keeping the score down. Bruges didn't come at us much - apart from one mistake in our defence, they never looked like scoring. But they were well organised at the back and it was a case of breaking them down. We controlled the game from start to finish."<ref name="guardian" /> Meanwhile Club Brugge manager [[Ernst Happel]] was critical of the quality of the Liverpool team: "Liverpool seemed only a shadow of the side we played in the UEFA Cup final two seasons ago. I was disappointed with them, but they deserved their victory although we were handicapped by injuries to two players."<ref name="guardian" />
