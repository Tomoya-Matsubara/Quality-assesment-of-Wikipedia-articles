'''U.S. Route 50''' (US&nbsp;50) is a transcontinental highway in the United States, stretching from [[Sacramento, California]] in the west to [[Ocean City, Maryland]] on the east coast. The [[Nevada]] portion crosses the center of state and was named '''The Loneliest Road in America''' by ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine in July 1986. The name was intended as a [[pejorative]], but instead, Nevada officials seized it as a marketing slogan. The name originates from large desolate areas traversed by the route, with few or no signs of civilization. The highway crosses several large desert valleys separated by numerous mountain ranges towering over the valley floors, in what is known as the [[Basin and Range]] provinces of the [[Great Basin]]. 

US&nbsp;50 has a diverse route through the state, traversing the resort communities of [[Lake Tahoe]], the state capitol in [[Carson City, Nevada|Carson City]], historical sites such as [[Fort Churchill State Historic Park]], [[petroglyph]]s, alpine forests, desert valleys, [[ghost towns]] and Nevada's only [[national park]], [[Great Basin National Park]].

The route was constructed over a historic corridor, first used for the [[Pony Express]] and later for the [[Central Overland Route]] and [[Lincoln Highway]]. Before the formation of the [[U.S. Highway System]], most of US&nbsp;50 in Nevada was designated '''State Route 2'''. The routing east of [[Ely, Nevada|Ely]] has changed significantly from the original plans. The route change resulted from a rivalry between Nevada and [[Utah]] over which transcontinental route was better to serve [[California]] bound traffic, the Lincoln Highway or the [[Victory Highway]].

US&nbsp;50 crosses the central portion of Nevada, entering the west side of the state near [[Lake Tahoe]] and exiting the east side near [[Great Basin National Park]]. The route crosses mostly desolate terrain in the journey across the state; US&nbsp;50 passes through several large desert valleys and [[Drainage basin|basins]]. The highway crosses 17 named [[mountain pass]]es that break up the Nevada desert. To crest of some of the passes along US&nbsp;50 requires navigating steep 8% [[Grade (slope)|grades]] and [[hairpin turn]]s through [[Temperate coniferous forest|pine forests]] to reach altitudes of over {{convert|7000|ft|m|sigfig=2}}.<ref name=benchmark/> 

In the stretch of highway between [[Fallon, Nevada|Fallon]] and [[Delta, Utah]], a span of {{convert|409|mi|km|0}}, there are three small towns, [[Austin, Nevada|Austin]], [[Eureka, Nevada|Eureka]] and [[Ely, Nevada|Ely]].<ref name=Fallontodelta>{{cite map

===Loneliest Road in America===
In July 1986, ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine published an article that gave US&nbsp;50 in Nevada the name "The Loneliest Road in America".<ref name=ncot>{{cite web

|format=PDF }}</ref> The article portrayed the highway, and rural Nevada, as a place devoid of civilization. Officials from [[White Pine County, Nevada|White Pine County]] decided to make the best of the publicity generated from the article, and convinced state authorities to do the same. Jointly, they began to use the [[pejorative]] article as a platform to market the area for visitors interested in desert scenery, history, and solitude.<ref name=ncot2>{{cite web

In 1991, [[Stephen King]] drove along US&nbsp;50 as part of a cross country trip. He stopped at [[Ruth, Nevada|Ruth]], a [[ghost town]] near [[Ely, Nevada|Ely]]. Studying the abandoned city, King fantasized about the fate of the last residents. King then heard a local legend about how the ghosts of Chinese miners, who died while trapped in a cave-in, can be seen crossing Highway&nbsp;50 to haunt the city of Ruth. King merged these details into his own story, including references to The Loneliest Road in America, which became the novel ''[[Desperation]]''.<ref>{{cite book

The Nevada Commission on Tourism sponsors a promotion where visitors can stop at several designated locations along the route and request a state issued novelty passport with a stamp representing that location. Visitors can mail-in the completed passport and receive a certificate, signed by the Governor, certifying they "survived" The Loneliest Road in America.<ref name=ncot/> The word survived is a [[tongue-in-cheek]] reference to the ''Life'' article, which quoted an [[American Automobile Association]] spokesperson as saying, "We warn all motorists not to drive there unless they're confident of their survival skills."<ref name=ncot2/>

In the 20 years that have passed since the article was published, US&nbsp;50 has gained popularity among people desiring a scenic or less traveled alternative to [[Interstate 80 in Nevada|Interstate 80]] across Nevada. This increase in popularity has caused some to dispute that US&nbsp;50 still deserves the title of The Loneliest Road in America.<ref name=sfgate>{{cite web

===Western Nevada===
US&nbsp;50 enters Nevada from California as a busy four lane thoroughfare on the shores of alpine Lake Tahoe in [[Stateline, Nevada]]. The highway follows the eastern shore, squeezing between the lake and the crest of the [[Carson Range]]. In one narrow spot the highway cuts through the mountains via the [[Cave Rock Tunnel]]. Eventually, the route crests the Carson Range at [[Spooner Summit]] and then descends into Nevada's capital, [[Carson City, Nevada|Carson City]]. Carson Street and William Street currently carry the highway through the city; however, the Nevada Department of Transportation has announced that, upon completion, US&nbsp;50 will be moved to a [[freeway]] alignment being constructed for [[Interstate 580 (Nevada)|Interstate 580]].<ref name=smbook/> 
[[Image:Stateline, Nevada.jpg|thumb|right|[[Stateline, Nevada]], where US&nbsp;50 enters the state along the shores of [[Lake Tahoe]] ]]
After Carson City, US&nbsp;50 follows the [[Carson River]] towards the [[Lahontan Valley]]. This portion is also mostly four lane, serving the commuter towns of [[Dayton, Nevada|Dayton]] and [[Silver Springs, Nevada|Silver Springs]] as well as passing by [[Fort Churchill State Historic Park]] and [[Lahontan State Recreation Area]]. In addition to the trails of the Pony Express and Lincoln Highway, this portion parallels the Carson River branch of the [[California Trail]]. The Carson River, and indirectly US&nbsp;50, form the southern edge of the [[Forty Mile Desert]]. This desert, located between the termini of the Carson and [[Humboldt River]]s, was the most dreaded part of the California Trail, where travelers had to endure {{convert|40|mi|km}} of desert heat with no usable water.<ref name=marker>{{cite web

At Silver Springs, [[U.S. Route 50 Alternate (Nevada)|U.S. Route 50 Alternate]] splits from the main route. Both branches are sometimes called the loneliest road, although the official designation begins with the first passport stamp available at [[Fernley, Nevada|Fernley]], along the alternate branch.<ref name=ncot/> The two branches rejoin west of [[Fallon, Nevada|Fallon]]. Fallon, home to the [[Naval Air Station Fallon]] or [[TOPGUN]], is an agricultural community along the last usable water of the Carson River. The town is located just south of the river's terminus at the [[Carson Sink]]. Leaving Fallon, the highway passes by ancient petroglyph sites at [[Grimes Point]] and then [[Sand Mountain (Nevada)|Sand Mountain]], a {{convert|600|ft|m|sigfig=2|adj=on}} sand dune.<ref name=blmsandmountain>{{cite web

===Fallon to Austin===
The scenery and level of traffic changes upon leaving the Fallon area. The now two lane US&nbsp;50 crosses remote terrain, crossing many instances of the geographical [[Basin and Range]] construct. The summits start out small and gradually increase in altitude. The features in the first basins include Labou Flat, a [[dry lake]] used by the [[US Navy]] for low level flight operations, and [[Dixie Valley, Nevada|Dixie Valley]], with several visible [[Geologic fault|earthquake fault lines]] that resulted from the magnitude 7.1 Dixie Valley/Fairview [[earthquake]] in 1954.<ref name=usgs>{{cite web

Nearby is a relatively recent attraction, a [[Shoe tree (roadside attraction)|cottonwood tree with thousands of shoes]] dangling from it. Frequent patrons of the bar at Middlegate are unsure of the origins; however most believe it started sometime in the mid 1980s. A legend has formed about how a young man was traveling to [[Reno, Nevada|Reno]] with his bride to be. When she balked and got out of the car, he threw her shoes in the tree so she couldn't get away. A reporter for the San Francisco Chronicle began to study the phenomenon of shoe trees after seeing the one at Middlegate, stating to his knowledge this was the biggest in the world.<ref name=shoetree>{{cite news

===Austin to Ely===
[[Image:LincolnhighwayNV.JPG|thumb|right|Lincoln Highway Sign along US&nbsp;50 at Middlegate with the Middlegate [[Shoe tossing|shoe tree]] visible in the distance]] 
Austin lies {{convert|110|mi|km}} east of Fallon. The city, founded by Pony Express riders that discovered silver, was a mining [[boomtown]] that now describes itself as a living ghost town. In 1862, at the peak of the silver boom, Austin had a population of 10,000 people. Today, about 300 residents remain.<ref name=austincc>{{cite web

This area is inside the [[Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest]], the first part of US&nbsp;50 to run inside a national forest since leaving Lake Tahoe. At Hickson Summit, about {{convert|20|mi|km}} east of Austin, is a [[rest area]] that features a walking tour of [[petroglyph]]s.<ref name=benchmark/>

The next town is [[Eureka, Nevada|Eureka]], which bills itself as the "Friendliest Town on the Loneliest Road in America". Eureka was similarly founded as a mining boomtown. Although mining has diminished, it remains a large component of the community and its economy.<ref name=ncoteureka>{{cite web

Past Eureka is [[Ely, Nevada|Ely]], founded as a stage coach station along the Pony Express and [[Central Overland Route]]. Ely's mining boom came later than the other towns along US&nbsp;50, with the discovery of [[copper]] in 1906. Though the railroads connecting the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]] to the mines in Austin and Eureka have long been removed, the railroad to Ely is preserved as a [[heritage railway]] by the [[Nevada Northern Railway]] and known as the Ghost Train of Old Ely.<ref name=ely>{{cite web

===Lincoln Highway===
[[Image:Hwy50Nevada.jpg|thumb|The eastern junction of US&nbsp;50 and US&nbsp;93 at Majors Place]]

}}</ref> At the time, the states of Utah and Nevada were feuding about which of the old [[auto trail]]s would be paved and used for the new U.S. Highway system. Utah officials refused to pave the portion of the Lincoln Highway west of Salt Lake City. They perceived this route as being expensive to build, with no benefit for the state. Nevada officials, and the Lincoln Highway Association, pleaded with Utah authorities to change their position, even offering funds to help offset the additional cost of paving that route. However, Utah favored the [[Victory Highway]] (modern [[Interstate 80 (Nevada)|Interstate 80]]). The Lincoln highway directed travelers destined for both [[southern California|southern]] and [[northern California]] on a route away from Utah cities, towards central Nevada. The Victory Highway was a shorter, more direct route, that only directed traffic for northern California out of the state.<ref name=uthisttogo>{{cite web

The final blow to the original route of the Lincoln Highway was the formation of the [[Dugway Proving Grounds]], a military base used for weapons testing, which closed the area to the public.

Most of modern US&nbsp;50 was pieced together from several routes designated as Nevada State Routes in the early 1900s. The portion from Lake Tahoe to Carson City was originally a portion of [[Nevada State Route 3|State Route 3]]. The original designation for US&nbsp;50 from Carson City to Ely was Route&nbsp;2 and 2A. East of Ely was originally numbered Route 7 to the modern junction with US&nbsp;93 and Route 14 from there to the Utah state line.<ref name=historicalmaps>{{cite web

The modern route of US&nbsp;50 has significantly changed since the highway was first commissioned in 1926. The biggest change is between Ely and [[Green River, Utah]]. The first contiguous route of the highway between these cites followed the modified routing of the Lincoln Highway to Salt Lake City. The highway returned to Green River along what is now numbered [[Utah State Route 201|UT 201]], [[U.S. Route 89 (Utah)|US 89]], and [[U.S. Route 6 (Utah)|US 6]]. The route was changed when the more direct route between these cities (via [[Delta, Utah]]) was paved. The 1954 edition of the Nevada highway map was the first to show the new routing.<ref name=historicalmaps/>

Previously, the road to Delta consisted of unpaved state routes. The paved route did not follow the exact route of the old dirt roads. The improved route bypassed the ghost town of Osceola and entered Utah approximately {{convert|14|mi|km|sigfig=2}} to the south of the dirt road. The border crossing was moved to facilitate an easier route across western Utah. In Utah, the old road traversed a difficult route through Marjum Canyon, while the paved route followed a simpler path along the north shore of [[Sevier Lake]].<ref name=benchmarkUT>{{cite map
