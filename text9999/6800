Australian rock music historian, [[Ian McFarlane]] has described Borich as "one of the most celebrated guitar players in the history of Australian rock.

==Early years==

==1964&ndash;1975: The La De Das==
{{main|La De Das}}
With the addition of [[vocal]]ist/[[rhythm guitar]]ist Phil Key, The Mergers with Borich on [[lead guitar]]/vocals, Neilsen on drums/vocals and Wilson on bass guitar, were eventually renamed as [[The La De Das]] in 1964 in Auckland, New Zealand.<ref name="McFLDD"/><ref name="Miles"/> In June 1965 they recorded their debut single, "Little Girl", and later that year added Bruce Howard on [[keyboard instrument|keyboards]].<ref name="McFLDD"/><ref name="Miles"/> From 1966 to 1967 they had five New Zealand top 10 hits, "How is the Air Up There?", "On Top of the World", "Hey Baby", "All Purpose Low" and "Rosalie".<ref name="McFLDD"/><ref name="Miles"/> By 1968 they were based in [[Sydney]] and recorded their [[concept album]], ''The Happy Prince'', in 1969 on [[EMI]].<ref name="McFLDD"/><ref name="Miles"/> Line-up changes occurred with Borich and Key joined by Peter Roberts on bass guitar and Keith Barber on drums by 1971's Australian [[Kent Music Report]] top 10 hit single, "Gonna See My Baby Tonight".<ref name="Kent"/> It had been written by Borich,<ref name="APRA Gonna See"/> who had established a reputation as "Australia's guitar hero supremo"<ref name="McFLDD"/> and regularly performed "[[All Along the Watchtower]]" using [[Jimi Hendrix]]' interpretation of the [[Bob Dylan]] song to close The La De Das' live set.<ref name="McFLDD"/> In late January 1972 they appeared at the inaugural, [[Sunbury Pop Festival#1972|Sunbury Pop Festival]] and featured on the subsequent double album, ''Sunbury'', released in October by EMI/[[HMV]].<ref name="McFLDD"/><ref name="Miles"/> The La De Das recorded further albums and singles and despite critical acclaim had little chart success, only Borich remained throughout until he disbanded the group in 1975.<ref name="McFLDD"/> After The La De Das, Borich toured with [[John Paul Young|John Paul Young & the Allstars]] for some months before forming a new band.

==1976&ndash;1989: Kevin Borich Express to The Party Boys==
{{main|The Party Boys}}
Kevin Borich Express was formed in early 1976 by Borich on [[lead guitar]], [[lead vocals]] and occasional [[flute]] with Harry Brus on [[bass guitar]] (ex-[[Blackfeather]]) and Barry Harvey on [[drums]] (Wild Cherries, Chain).<ref name="McF"/><ref name="ARDb"/> They recorded a track, "The End of Me" before Brus and Harvey were soon replaced by Reuben San Fiansco on bass guitar and Gil Matthews on drums.<ref name="McF"/><ref name="ARDb"/> Subsequent line-ups were typically a three piece with a succession of bass guitarist and drummers.<ref name="McF"/> They released their debut single, "Goin' Somewhere" in October using Fiansco, and John Annas on drums ([[Wendy Saddington|Wendy Saddington Band]]), following in March 1977 was their debut album, ''Celebration!'' with Annas, and Tim Partridge on bass guitar ([[Mighty Kong (band)]], The Johnny Rocco Band).<ref name="McF"/><ref name="ARDb"/> The album was favoured by critics and peaked in the top 30 on the [[Kent Music Report|Australian albums charts]].<ref name="McF"/><ref name="Kent"/>

In early 1977, Borich supported the tour by UK rock guitarist, [[Jeff Beck]]; this was followed in October by supporting the [[Rockarena]] tour with [[Santana (band)|Santana]], [[Fleetwood Mac]] and [[Little River Band]] - Borich was invited on-stage to jam with [[Carlos Santana]].<ref name="McF"/> In May 1978, the band toured USA in support of Australian heavy rockers, [[AC/DC]], with Annas, Paul Christie on bass guitar and [[keyboard instrument|keyboard player]] Tim Schafer ([[Gary Wright|Gary Wright Band]]).<ref name="McF"/><ref name="Kent"/> This line-up recorded, ''No Turning Back'' which was released in March 1979.

By mid-year, Partridge had returned with both Christie and Schafer departing, and together with Annas, Borich recorded ''Live!'',<ref name="McF"/><ref name="Kent"/> using the 2JJ mobile studio equipment over performances in Melbourne and Wollongong. ''Live!'' contains one of the most incendiary and atmospheric versions of ''Little Red Rooster'' ever recorded along with a number of Borich standards.

In July, Kevin Borich Express appeared on [[Ren<U+00E9>e Geyer|Ren<U+00E9>e Geyer's]] album, ''Blues License''.<ref name="McF"/><ref name="Kent"/> A European tour by Kevin Borich Express resulted in a [[compilation album]] being released in Germany.<ref name="McF"/> After the tour, John Watson (Heavy Division) replaced Annas on drums and the band recorded, ''Angel's Hand'' in November 1979.<ref name="McF"/><ref name="ARDb"/> Similar line-up changes continued into the early 1980s with Michael Deep replacing Partridge in April 1980. This line-up collaborated with solo artist [[Dutch Tilders]] to record ''Blues Had a Baby and They Called It Rock'n'Roll'' in 1981 on [[RCA|RCA Records]].<ref name="McF"/><ref name="ARDb"/> Kerry Jacobsen ([[Dragon (band)|Dragon]]) replaced Watson on drums for ''Shy Boys Shy Girls'' [[Extended play|mini-LP]] in late 1981. By mid-1982, Annas returned on drums, with Steve Balbi on bass guitar, and Andy Cowan on keyboards. Later that year, Borich on guitar joined [[The Party Boys]] which was formed by previous band member Paul Christie (now ex-[[Mondo Rock]]) on bass guitar, drums and backing vocals, Harvey James ([[Sherbet (band)|Sherbet]]) on guitar and [[Graham Bidstrup]] ([[The Angels (Australian band)|The Angels]]) on drums.<ref name="McF"/><ref name="ARDb"/><ref name="McFPB">{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Australian Rock and Pop|last=McFarlane|first=Ian|publisher=Allen & Unwin|location=St Leonards, NSW|year=1999|chapter=Encyclopedia entry for 'The Party Boys'|chapterurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20040419103524/www.whammo.com.au/encyclopedia.asp?articleid=562|isbn=1-86448-768-2|accessdate=17 April 2009}}</ref> Initially a side-project, The Party Boys, had top 10 success with singles, "He's Gonna Step on You Again" (#1, 1987), "Hold Your Head Up" (#7, 1987)<ref name="Kent"/> and albums, ''Live at Several 21sts'' (#9, 1983), ''[[The Party Boys (album)|The Party Boys]]'' (#1, 1987).<ref name="Kent"/> Consequently Kevin Borich Express output and touring was reduced during the 1980s.<ref name="McF"/><ref name="McFPB"/> In 1989, Borich left The Party Boys and appeared in [[Jimmy Barnes|Jimmy Barnes band]] for the 1990 Two Fires tour.<ref name="McF"/>
