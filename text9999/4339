'''Kanyakumari''' {{audio|Kanyakumari.ogg|pronunciation}} ({{Lang-ta|<U+0B95><U+0BA9><U+0BCD><U+0BA9><U+0BBF><U+0BAF><U+0BBE><U+0B95><U+0BC1><U+0BAE><U+0BB0><U+0BBF>}}) is a [[town]] in the [[States and territories of India|state]] of [[Tamil Nadu]] in [[India]]. It is also sometimes referred to as '''Cape Comorin'''. Located at the southernmost tip of the Indian Peninsula, it is the geographical end of the Indian mainland. The district in Tamil Nadu where the town is located is called [[Kanyakumari District]]. The closest major cities are [[Nagercoil]], the administrative headquarters of [[Kanyakumari District]], ({{convert|22|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}) and [[Thiruvananthapuram]], the capital of [[Kerala]] ({{convert|85|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}).

The town is a popular tourist place in India.

==Recorded history==
Kanyakumari takes its name from the Kumari Amman or Kanyakumari Temple, situated in the town, on the sea-shore, the very confluence of the three water-bodies <U+2013> the [[Arabian Sea]], the [[Bay of Bengal]]<ref>[http://www.kanyakumari.com/ Kanyakumari.com]</ref> and the [[Indian Ocean]]. In his work on ancient India, Ptolemy had identified Kanyakumari (Cape Comorin) along with the Gulf of Mannar as a center for pearl fishery. He also identifies ''Korkai'', a place to the east of Kanyakumari as an emporium of pearl trade, also Travancore Census 1931 says that [[Paravar]]s ruled that Coast and built the temple for their reverence to Sea Goddess.<ref name="Muslim Identity, Print Culture, and the Dravidian Factor in Tamil Nadu">Muslim Identity, Print Culture, and the Dravidian Factor in Tamil Nadu By J.

==Myths and legends==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2012}}
There are multiple myths revolving around this place:

*According to Hindu legend, [[Kanya Devi]], an [[Avatar]] of Parvati, was to marry Siva, but as he failed to show up on his wedding day, the rice and other grains meant for the wedding feast remained uncooked and remain unused thereafter. As the legend goes, the uncooked grains turned into stones as time went by. Some believe that the small stones which look like rice on the shore today, are indeed grains of the wedding that was never solemnized. [[Kanya Devi]] is now considered a virgin goddess who blesses pilgrims and tourists who flock the town.

*According to another Hindu legend, [[Hanuman|Lord Hanuman]] dropped a piece of earth as he was carrying a mountain with his life-saving herb, [[Mrita Sanjivani]], from the Himalayas to Lanka ([[Sri Lanka]]) during the Rama-Ravana war. This chunk of earth is called [[Marunthuvazh Malai]], which is literally translated to "hills where medicine lives".This is said to be the reason for the abundance of unique native medicinal plants in the area. [[Marunthuvazh Malai]] is located near Kottaram about {{convert|7|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} from Kanyakumari town on the Kanyakumari-Nagercoil highway.

*The sage [[Agasthya]], who was himself  an expert in medicinal herbs, is believed to have lived around this site in ancient days. The reason why, some believe, so many medicinal herbs are to be found on these hills near Kanyakumari. There is even a village by the name [[Agastheeswaram]] close to the town, named after the sage. Today, there is a small [[Ashram]] on the middle of the Maruthuvazh Malai hill, which tourists visit (after a short trek from the base of the hill), both to visit the Ashram and also to take a glimpse of the sea near Kanyakumari a few kilometres away, and the greenery below.

== Modern history==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2012}}
[[File:Gandhi Memorial Kanyakumari 5.jpg|thumb|Gandhi Memorial Kanyakumari ]]

Kanyakumari has been a great centre for art and religion for centuries. It was also an area of great trade and commerce. It was ruled by the [[Cholas]], the [[Chera dynasty|Chera]]s, the [[Pandyan kingdom|Pandyas]] and the [[Nayak (ethnic group)|Nayak]]s. The architectural beauty of the temples in the area are the works of these rulers. Later Kanyakumari became part of the [[Venad]] kingdom with its capital at [[Padmanabhapuram]]. The king of Venad, Anizham Thirunal [[Marthanda Varma]], established [[Travancore]] by extending his domain further north up to Azhva, during his reign from 1729 to 1758. By this, the present Kanyakumari District came to be known as Southern Travancore. In 1741, Maharaja [[Marthanda Varma]] defeated the Dutch East India Company at the famous [[Battle of Colachel]].

Kanyakumari was under the rule of the Paravar Kings till the downfall of Pandyas, and later by kings of Travancore under the overall suzerainty of the British until 1947, when India became independent. Travancore joined the independent Indian Union in 1947. The reign of the Travancore royals came to an end.

Under [[Travancore]] rule, the town, and the modern administrative district that bears its name, [[Kanyakumari District]], progressed both socially and economically. Still a significant part of population study and speak [[Malayalam]] as their mother-tongue. The culture followed by Kanyakumari people is mixed and has more influence from [[Travancore]].

In 1949, Kanyakumari became part of the reconstituted Travancore-Cochin State. Around this time, a popular agitation for the amalgamation of Kanyakumari District with Tamil Nadu by the Tamil-speaking people of the district intensified, under the leadership of [[Marshal Nesamony]]

Kumari Thanthai Marshal Nesamony was instrumental in the merger of Kanyakumari district with Tamil Nadu in 1956 during the linguistic reorganisation of states. Kanyakumari was integrated with Tamil Nadu (then known as Madras State) as per the language-based reorganisation of States.

Christianity arrived in South India around AD 52 through [[Thomas (Apostle)|St. Thomas]], one of the twelve Apostles of Christ. However, European missionaries, who arrived in the 16th century, propagated Christianity in the area. [[St. Francis Xavier]] (April 7, 1506 <U+2013> December 2, 1552) was the pioneer in preaching Christianity in the present day Kanyakumari district. Islam is believed to have entered the southern part of India through Kanyakumari during the early part of the eighth century AD through traders and missionaries who came through sea-routes.  Islam, Christianity and [[Jainism]] have also contributed to the architectural wealth and literary heritage of the region.

==Tourism==
[[Image:Gandhi Memorial Kanyakumari.jpg|right|thumbnail|The Gandhi Mandapam]]
[[File:Images of Kanyakumari Sangam 3.jpg|thumb|Kanyakumari Sangam]]
Since the early 1970s, tourism has been an important activity in the town. Because of this it is one of the few small towns in South India where one can see many of the different languages of India spoken in the street. 

Of late, the promotion of tourism has increased, with attractions that do not include the town, such as the surrounding landscapes, as well as the historical and religious sites found around the district, being emphasised to a greater degree. Ultimately a total of 1.9 million tourists (domestic and foreign) visited Kanyakumari in 2007.<ref name="http://www.hindu.com/2008/01/15/stories/2008011555560100.htm">http://www.hindu.com/2008/01/15/stories/2008011555560100.htm</ref>

Though there are several places of tourist-interest in the town and district, Kanyakumari is especially popular in India for its spectacular and unique sunrise and sunset. The confluence of three ocean bodies <U+2013> the Bay of Bengal, the Indian Ocean, and the Arabian Sea <U+2013> makes the sunrise and sunset even more special. On balmy, full-moon evenings, (locally called [[Chitra Pournami]]) one can also see the moon-rise and sunset at the same time.

==Tourist sites==

[[Image:Kanyakumari Temple.jpg|thumb|right|View of the Kanyakumari temple.]]
[[Image:Sea-view from Vattakottai Fort.JPG|thumb|right|View of the sea from [[Vattakottai]] Fort, near Kanyakumari town.]]
The Kumari Amman or the Kanyakumari Temple, located on the shore, is a [[Shakti Peetha]] dedicated to a manifestation of Parvati, the virgin goddess who did penance to obtain Lord Shiva's hand in marriage. The temple and the adjoining [[Ghats|ghat]], situated overlooking the shore, attract tourists from all over the world. The sparkling diamond nose-ring of the deity is said to be visible even from the sea.
[[Image:Kanyakumari.jpg|right|thumb|Daybreak at Kanyakumari]]

On two rocky islets just off the shore, southeast of the Kumari Amman temple, are the [[Vivekananda Rock Memorial]], built in 1970, and the gigantic {{convert|133|ft|m|0}} tall  statue of [[Tamil people|Tamil]] saint-poet [[Thiruvalluvar]] (Completed on January 1, 2000 by the legandary Dr. V. Ganapati Sthapati, Chennai) is one of the biggest statues in Asia. One of the rocks called [[Sri Padhaparai]] is said to bear the footprints of the virgin goddess. [[Swami Vivekananda]] is said to have meditated on this rock for three days. Also on this rock, there is a [[Dhyana in Hinduism|Dhyana]] mandapam, an area for meditation. Ferry services are available to reach the memorial.

The Gandhi Memorial has been built on the spot where the urn containing the [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Mahatma]]'s ashes was kept for public viewing before immersion. Resembling central Indian Hindu temples in form, the memorial was designed in such a way that on Mahatma Gandhi's birthday, 2 October, the first rays of the sun fall on the exact place where his ashes were kept.

* Our Lady of Ransom Church situated in Kanyakumari,the place where the missionaries had preached the paravas and converted them to Christianity.The first church in the form of a thatched roof was built here in the early 15th century for venerating Santhosha Madha .The church at present stands 153 m tall and it was 100 years old.The new church was built in Gothic Architecture and it looks fabulous when seen with the seashore background, viewing from Our Lady of Ransom Arch near Church Road entrance.<p>From the shore where the fishing boats are moored you can see the three towering spires of this off-white Gothic structure with a distinct Portuguese feel. The Church of Our Lady of Ransom is a more than 100-year-old building dedicated to Mother Mary. But what catches your eye first-up is the 153-foot-high (46 meters) central tower crowned with a Cross of pure gold. Truly a beautiful structure; the church looks particularly gorgeous against the molten-blue noon sky. Astonishingly, the grand Gothic fa<U+00E7>ade is a striking contrast to its almost bare interiors.<p>Once you tread in you will be goggled by its hollowness; no pews anywhere in sight, only a beautiful idol of Mother Mary clad in a sari <U+2013> like in most South Indian churches <U+2013> and a little Cross on the altar. This emptiness is further accentuated by colorful light patterns thrown by the stained-glass windows on the bare floor. And one is given to wonder that the church is probably no longer functional! On the contrary, in fact, the church holds mass regularly on the floor made of sand. Since the parish here predominantly comprise local fishing folks, mass is always held in the regional language Tamil.

The entrance to this temple is reminiscent of the Chinese architecture of a Buddhist [[Vihar]].
*[[Padmanabhapuram Palace]] is a large 17th century palace of the [[Travancore]] kings, made almost entirely of wood <U+2013> the only one of its kind in India.
*[[Udayagiri Fort]], built by King [[Marthanda Varma]], has a foundry for casting guns. It is also the tomb-site of the king's trusted European general Captain [[Eustachius De Lannoy|De Lennoy]].
