'''Canada''' is the world's [[List of countries by area|second largest]] [[country]], extending from the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the [[Pacific Ocean]] and northward into the [[Arctic Ocean]]. Occupying most of the northern portion of [[North America]], Canada shares land borders with the [[United States]] to the south and to the northwest.

Inhabited originally by [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|aboriginal peoples]], Canada was founded as a union of [[British overseas territories|British colonies]], some of which had earlier been [[French colonial empires|French colonies]]. Now a [[federation|federal]] [[dominion]] of ten [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provinces]] and three [[Provinces and territories of Canada#Territories of Canada|territories]], Canada peacefully obtained sovereignty from [[United Kingdom|Britain]] in a process spanning from 1867 to 1982. 

Canada is a [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary democracy]] and [[constitutional monarchy]], and defines itself as a [[Bilingualism in Canada|bilingual]] and [[multiculturalism|multicultural]] nation; both [[Canadian English|English]] and [[French in Canada|French]] are official languages. A technologically advanced and industrialized nation, its diversified [[Economy of Canada|economy]] relies heavily on an abundance of natural resources and on trade, particularly with the [[United States]], with which Canada has had a [[Canada-United States relations|long and complex relationship]].

==Origin and history of the name==
{{main|Canada's name}}
The name ''Canada'' is believed to come from the [[Wyandot|Huron]]-[[Iroquoian languages|Iroquois]] word ''kanata'', which means "village" or "settlement". In 1535, locals used the word to tell [[Jacques Cartier]] the way to the village of [[Stadacona]], <ref>{{cite web |author=Heritage Canada |authorlink=Department of Canadian Heritage |publisher= Heritage Canada |url=http://www.canadianheritage.gc.ca/progs/cpsc-ccsp/sc-cs/o5_e.cfm |title= Origin of the Name - Canada|date=[[2006-05-14]]|accessdate=2006-05-14}}</ref> site of present-day [[Quebec City]]. Cartier used Canada to refer not only to Stadacona, but also to the entire area subject to Donnacona, Chief at Stadacona; by 1547, maps began referring to this and the surrounding area as Canada.

The French colony of [[Canada, New France|Canada]], [[New France]], was set up along the [[Saint Lawrence River]] and the northern shores of the [[Great Lakes]]. Later, as British colonies, they were called [[Upper Canada]] and [[Lower Canada]] until their union as the British [[Province of Canada]] in 1841. Upon [[Canadian Confederation |Confederation]] in 1867, the name Canada was officially adopted for the new [[dominion]], which was commonly referred to as the ''Dominion of Canada'' until the 1950s. As Canada increasingly acquired political authority and autonomy from [[United Kingdom|Britain]], the federal government increasingly began using simply ''Canada'' on state documents and treaties.  The [[Canada Act 1982]] refers only to ''Canada'' and, as such, is currently the only legal, as well as bilingual, name. This was also reflected later in 1982 with the renaming of the national holiday from [[Dominion Day]] to [[Canada Day]].

== History ==
:''Main articles: [[History of Canada]], [[Timeline of Canadian history]]''

While Aboriginal tradition holds that the [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|First Peoples]] have inhabited parts of Canada since the dawn of time, archaeological studies date human presence in northern [[Yukon]] to 26,000 years ago, and in southern [[Ontario]] to 9,500 years ago.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Cinq-Mars | first = J. | year = 2001 | title = On the significance of modified mammoth bones from eastern Beringia | journal = The World of Elephants - International Congress, Rome | url = http://www.cq.rm.cnr.it/elephants2001/pdf/424_428.pdf | accessdate = 2006-05-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Wright, J.V |publisher= Canadian Museum of Civilization Corporation |url=http://www.civilization.ca/archeo/hnpc/npvol04e.html |title=A History of the Native People of Canada: Early and Middle Archaic Complexes|date=[[2001-09-27]]|accessdate=2006-05-14}}</ref> Europeans first arrived when the [[Vikings]] settled briefly at [[L'Anse aux Meadows]] circa AD 1000. The next Europeans to explore Canada's Atlantic coast included [[John Cabot]] in 1497 and [[Martin Frobisher]] in 1576 for [[Kingdom of England|England]], and [[Jacques Cartier]] in 1534 and [[Samuel de Champlain]] in 1603 for [[France]]. The first permanent European settlements were established by the French at [[Port Royal, Nova Scotia|Port Royal]] in 1605 and [[Quebec City]] in 1608, and by the English in [[Newfoundland]], around 1610.  European explorers and trappers brought European diseases, which spread rapidly through native trade routes and decimated the Aboriginal population.

[[Image:Death-wolfe.jpg|thumb|left|240px|''[[The Death of General Wolfe]]'', painted by [[Benjamin West]], depicts British [[James Wolfe|General Wolfe]]'s death after his victory at the [[Battle of the Plains of Abraham]] in 1759.]]

As competition for territory, naval bases, furs and fish escalated, several wars broke out involving the French, [[Kingdom of England|English]] and Native tribes. The [[French and Iroquois Wars]] erupted between the [[Iroquois|Iroquois Confederation]] and the [[Algonquin]], with their French allies, over control of the fur trade. The series of four [[French and Indian Wars]], between 1689 and 1763, saw the French and their Native allies successively lose land to the English.  After the British victory in the [[Seven Years War]], Britain seized the remainder of New France at the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1763. 

As a result of the [[American Revolution]], approximately 50,000 [[United Empire Loyalists]] moved to  [[Province of Quebec (1763-1791)|Quebec]], [[Nova Scotia]], [[Prince Edward Island]] and Newfoundland.<ref name="moore">{{cite book |first= Christopher |last=Moore |year=1994 |title=The Loyalist: Revolution Exile Settlement |publisher=McClelland & Stewart |location= Toronto |id=ISBN 0771060939}}</ref> As they were unwelcome in Nova Scotia, [[New Brunswick]] was carved out of that colony for them in 1784.  Further, to accommodate the English-speaking Loyalists in Quebec, the province was divided into Francophone [[Lower Canada]] and Anglophone [[Upper Canada]] under the [[Constitutional Act]] in 1791. Soon after, Canada was a major front in the [[War of 1812]] between the United States and British Empire and its successful defence had important long-term [[War_of_1812#Effects_on_British_North_America|effects on Canada]], including the building of a sense of unity and nationalism among the population of British North America.  Large-scale immigration to Canada began in 1815 from Britain and Ireland.  A series of agreements led to long-term peace between Canada and the United States, interrupted only briefly by raids made by political insurgents.

Following the failed [[Rebellions of 1837]], which demanded [[responsible government]], officials studied the political situation and issued the [[Report on the Affairs of British North America (1839)|Durham Report]] in 1839.  One goal <U+2013> which proved unacceptable in Quebec <U+2013> was to assimilate the French Canadians into British culture.<ref name="ce_durhamreport">{{cite web |author=David Mills |publisher= Historica Foundation of Canada |url=http://www.canadianencyclopedia.ca/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=A1ARTA0002473 |title=Durham Report |accessdate=2006-05-18}}</ref> [[The Canadas]] were merged into a single, quasi-federal colony, the [[United Province of Canada]], with the [[Act of Union (1840)]]. After the U.S. and Britain agreed to the [[49th parallel north]] as the border with western British North America in 1846, the British government created the colony of [[Colony of Vancouver Island|Vancouver's Island]] [sic] in 1849 and, with the outbreak of the [[Fraser Canyon Gold Rush]], the colony of [[Colony of British Columbia|British Columbia]] in 1858, but both were entirely separate from the United Province of Canada.  By the late 1850s, leaders in Canada launched a series of western exploratory expeditions, with the intention of assuming control of [[Rupert's Land]] and the [[Arctic]] region.  The Canadian population grew rapidly due to high birth rates; large immigration rates from Europe were offset by migration to the United States, especially by French Canadians moving to New England.

[[Image:Johnamacdonald1870.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sir]] [[John A. Macdonald]], first [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]].]]

Following the [[Great Coalition]], the [[Charlottetown Conference]] and the [[Quebec Conference, 1864|Quebec Conference]] of 1864, and the [[London Conference of 1866|London Conference]] of 1866, the three colonies&mdash;Canada, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick&mdash;undertook the process of [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]]. The [[Constitution Act, 1867|British North America Act]] created "one dominion under the name of [[Canada's name#Adoption of Dominion|Canada]]", with four provinces: Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick.<ref>{{cite book | last=Farthing |first= John |title= Freedom Wears a Crown |location= Toronto |publisher=Kingswood House |date=1957 |id = ASIN B0007JC4G2}}</ref>  After Canada assumed control of Rupert's Land and the [[North-Western Territory]], which together formed the [[Northwest Territories]] in 1870, a lack of attention to the [[M<U+00E9>tis people (Canada)|M<U+00E9>tis]] led to the [[Red River Rebellion]], which eventually led to the creation of the province of [[Manitoba]] and its entry into Confederation in July 1870. The separate colonies of British Columbia (which included Vancouver Island since 1866) and Prince Edward Island joined Confederation in 1871 and 1873, respectively.  To connect the union and assert authority over the western provinces, Canada constructed three trans-continental railways, most notably the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]], encouraged immigrants to develop the prairies with the [[Dominion Lands Act]], and established the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police|North West Mounted Police]].  As more settlers came to the prairies on the railway and the population grew, regions of the Northwest Territories were given provincial status forming [[Alberta]] and [[Saskatchewan]] in 1905.

[[Image:Canadian tank and soldiers Vimy 1917.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Canadian soldiers advance behind a tank at the [[Battle of Vimy Ridge]] in 1917.]]
Canada automatically entered [[World War I]] in 1914 with Britain's declaration of war, and sent large numbers of volunteers to the Western Front. Casualties were so high that Prime Minister [[Robert Borden]] forced through [[Conscription Crisis of 1917|conscription]] in 1917, which was extremely unpopular in Quebec, leading to his Conservative party losing support in Quebec.  Although the Liberals were deeply divided over conscription, they pulled together and became the dominant political party. 

In 1919, Canada joined the [[League of Nations]] in its own right, and in 1931 the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]] confirmed that no act of the British parliament would extend to Canada without its consent. At the same time, the worldwide [[Great Depression of 1929]] affected Canadians of every class; the rise of the [[Co-operative Commonwealth Federation]] (CCF) in Alberta and Saskatchewan presaged a welfare state as pioneered by [[Tommy Douglas]] in the 1940s and 1950s. After supporting appeasement of Germany in the late 1930s, Liberal Prime Minister [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]] secured Parliament<U+2019>s approval for [[Military history of Canada during World War II|entry into World War II]] in 1939. The economy boomed during the war, as Canada grew closer to the United States.  In 1949, the formerly independent [[Dominion of Newfoundland]] joined Confederation as Canada's tenth province.

By Canada's centennial in 1967, mass post-war immigration from various war-ravaged European countries had changed the country's demographic.<ref>{{cite web | author= Harold Troper |publisher= Ontario Institute for Studies in Education |url=http://ceris.metropolis.net/Virtual%20Library/Demographics/troper1/troper1.html |title=History of Immigration to Toronto Since the Second World War: From Toronto 'the Good' to Toronto 'the World in a City' |date=2000-03 |accessdate=2006-05-19}}</ref> In addition, throughout the [[Vietnam War]], thousands of US American [[Draft dodger|draft dodgers]] fled to and settled in various parts of Canada.<ref>{{cite web | author= |publisher= |title= Toronto Anti-Draft Programme: Where the Guys Who Said "No!"

At a meeting of First Ministers in November 1981, the federal and provincial governments agreed to the [[patriation]] of the constitution, with [[Amendments to the Constitution of Canada|procedures for amending it]]. Despite the fact that the Quebec government did not agree to the changes, on [[17 April]], [[1982]], Canada, by Proclamation of Queen Elizabeth II, patriated its Constitution from Britain, thereby making Canada wholly sovereign, though the two countries continue to share the same monarch.
								
Quebec, having freed itself from traditionalism by the [[Quiet Revolution]] of the 1960s, began lobbying for its own partial or complete independence from Canada. Alienation between English-speaking Canada and the [[Qu<U+00E9>b<U+00E9>cois]] over the language, cultural and social divide had been exacerbated by many events, including the [[Conscription Crisis of 1944]]. Referendums in Quebec in [[1980 Quebec referendum|1980]] and [[1995 Quebec referendum|1995]] saw 59.6% and 50.6% of voters reject proposals for [[sovereignty-association]].<ref name="dickinson">{{cite book |first= John Alexander |last=Dickinson |coauthors=Young, Brian |year=2003 |title=A Short History of Quebec |publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press |edition=3rd edition |location= Montreal |id=ISBN 0773524509}}</ref> The Supreme Court, in 1997, [[Reference re Secession of Quebec|ruled unilateral secession by a province to be unconstitutional]].<ref name="dickinson" /> 

Economic integration with the United States increased after 1940. The [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) of 1994 was a defining moment in integrating the two countries.  From the 1980s onward, Canadians worried about their cultural autonomy as American TV shows, movies and corporations became omnipresent.<ref name="granatstein">{{cite book |first= J.L. |last=Granatstein |year=1997 |title=Yankee Go Home: Canadians and Anti-Americanism |publisher=HarperCollins |location= Toronto |id=ISBN 0006385419}}</ref> However, Canadians took special pride in their [[Health care in Canada| system of universal health care]] and their commitment to multiculturalism.<ref name="bickerton" >{{cite book |author=Bickerton, James & Gagnon, Alain-G & Gagnon, Alain (Eds). |title=Canadian Politics |publisher=Broadview Press |edition=4th edition |location=Orchard Park, NY |id=ISBN 1551115956 |year=2004}}</ref>

==Government==
:''Main articles: [[Politics of Canada]], [[Monarchy in Canada]] and [[Governor General of Canada]]''
[[Image:Canada Parliament2.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Centre Block, [[Parliament Hill]], [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]].]]
Canada is a [[constitutional monarchy]], that recognizes [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]] as Queen of Canada (since [[February 6]], [[1952]]),<ref>{{cite web |author=Heritage Canada |authorlink=Department of Canadian Heritage |publisher= Heritage Canada |url=http://www.pch.gc.ca/royalvisit2005/53_e.cfm |title=The Queen and Canada: 53 Years of Growing Together|date=[[2005-04-21]]|accessdate=2006-05-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Governor General of Canada |authorlink=Governor General of Canada |publisher= Governor General of Canada|url=http://www.gg.ca/gg/rr/index_e.asp |title=Role and Responsibilities of the Governor General|date=[[2005-12-06]]|accessdate=2006-05-14}}</ref> and a [[parliamentary democracy]] with a [[federation|federal system]] of [[Parliament|parliamentary government]], and strong democratic traditions. 

[[Constitution of Canada|Canada's constitution]] governs the legal framework of the country and consists of written text and unwritten traditions and conventions.<ref>{{cite web |author=Department of Justice |publisher= Department of Justice, Canada |url=http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/const/index.html |title=Constitution Acts 1867 to 1982|accessdate=2006-05-14}}</ref> The Constitution includes the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]], which guarantees basic rights and freedoms for Canadians that, generally, cannot be overridden by legislation of any level of government in Canada. It contains, however, a "[[Section Thirty-three of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|notwithstanding clause]]", which allows the federal parliament and the provincial legislatures the power to override some other sections of the Charter temporarily, for a period of five years.

The position of [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]], Canada's [[head of government]], belongs to the leader of the political party that can obtain the confidence of a majority in the [[Canadian House of Commons|House of Commons]]. The Prime Minister and his or her cabinet are formally appointed by the [[Governor General]]. However, the Prime Minister chooses the cabinet and the Governor General, by convention, respects the Prime Minister's choices. The [[Cabinet of Canada|Cabinet]] is traditionally drawn from members of the Prime Minister's party in both legislative houses, and mostly from the House of Commons. Executive power is exercised by the prime minister and cabinet, all of whom are sworn into the [[Privy Council of Canada]] and become Ministers of the Crown. The Prime Minister exercises a great deal of political power, especially in the appointment of other officials within the government and [[civil service]]. [[Stephen Harper]], leader of the [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative Party]], has served as Prime Minister since [[February 6]], [[2006]].

The [[Parliament of Canada|federal parliament]] is made up of the Queen and two houses: an elected House of Commons and an appointed [[Canadian Senate|Senate]]. Each member in the House of Commons is elected by [[plurality electoral system|simple plurality]] in a [[electoral district (Canada)|"riding" or electoral district]]; general elections are called by the Governor General when the Prime Minister so advises, and must occur every five years or less. Members of the Senate, whose seats are apportioned on a regional basis, are chosen by the Prime Minister and formally appointed by the Governor General, and serve until age 75.

Canada's four major political parties are the [[Conservative Party of Canada]], [[Liberal Party of Canada]], [[New Democratic Party]] (NDP), and the [[Bloc Qu<U+00E9>b<U+00E9>cois]]. The current government is formed by the Conservative Party of Canada. While the [[Green Party of Canada]] and other smaller parties do not have current representation in Parliament, the list of [[List of political parties in Canada#Historical parties that have won seats in Parliament|historical parties with elected representation]] is substantial.

==Law==
[[Image:Supreme Court of Canada.jpg|thumb|240px|right|The [[Supreme Court of Canada]] in Ottawa, west of Parliament Hill]]
{{main|Law of Canada}}
Canada's [[judiciary]] plays an important role in interpreting laws and has the power to strike down laws that violate the Constitution. The [[Supreme Court of Canada]] is the highest court and final arbiter and is lead by the Right Honourable Madam Chief Justice [[Beverley McLachlin]], P.C. Its nine members are appointed by the [[Governor_General_of_Canada|Governor General]] on the advice of the Prime Minister. All judges at the superior and appellate levels are appointed by the Governor General on the advice of the prime minister and minister of justice, after consultation with non-governmental legal bodies. The federal cabinet appoints justices to superior courts at the provincial and territorial levels. Judicial posts at the lower provincial and territorial levels are filled by their respective governments (see [[Court system of Canada]] for more detail).

[[Common law]] prevails everywhere except in Quebec, where [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] predominates. [[Criminal law in Canada|Criminal law]] is solely a federal responsibility and is uniform throughout Canada. Law enforcement, including criminal courts, is a provincial responsibility, but in most provinces policing is contracted to the federal [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] (RCMP).

==Foreign relations and military==
:''Main articles: [[Foreign relations of Canada]], [[Canadian Forces]], [[Military history of Canada]]''
[[Image:Peacekeeping monument.jpg|thumb|right|240px|The [[Peacekeeping Monument]] in Ottawa.]]

Canada has a close [[U.S.-Canada relations|relationship with the United States]], sharing the world's longest undefended border, co-operating on some military campaigns and exercises, and being each other's largest trading partners. Canada also shares history and long relationships with Britain and [[France]], the two most significant imperial powers in its founding. These relations extend to other former-members of the British and French empires, through Canada's membership in the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] and [[La Francophonie]].

Over the past 60 years, Canada has been an advocate for [[multilateralism]], making efforts to resolve global issues in collaboration with other nations.<ref name="canada_policy">

In addition to their peacekeeping missions, Canadian forces have served in various military actions including World War I, World War II, the [[Korean War]], and the [[First Gulf War]].   Canada has also participated in a variety of capacities in NATO operations such as in the former [[Yugoslavia]]. Since 2001, Canada has had troops deployed in [[Afghanistan]] as part of the [[United States invasion of Afghanistan|U.S. stabilization force]] and the UN-authorized, NATO-commanded [[International Security Assistance Force]]. Canada's [[Disaster Assistance Response Team]] (DART) has participated in three major relief efforts in the past two years; the two-hundred member team has been deployed in relief operations after [[Hurricane Katrina]] in September 2005, after the [[2005 Kashmir earthquake|Kashmir earthquake]] in October 2005 and after the [[2004 tsunami|December 2004 tsunami]] in South Asia.

Canada is composed of ten provinces and three territories. The provinces are [[Ontario]], [[Quebec]], [[Nova Scotia]], [[New Brunswick]], [[Manitoba]], [[British Columbia]], [[Prince Edward Island]], [[Saskatchewan]], [[Alberta]], and [[Newfoundland and Labrador]].  The three territories are the [[Northwest Territories]], [[Yukon]], and [[Nunavut]].  The provinces have a [[Canadian federalism|large degree of autonomy]] from the federal government, the territories somewhat less. Each has its own [[List of Canadian provincial and territorial symbols|provincial or territorial symbols]].

The provinces are responsible for most of Canada's social programs (such as [[Health care in Canada|health care]], [[Education in Canada|education]], and [[welfare (financial aid)|welfare]]) and together collect more revenue than the federal government, an almost unique structure among federations in the world. The federal government can initiate national policies in provincial areas, such as the [[Canada Health Act]]; the provinces can opt out of these, but rarely do so in practice. [[Equalization payments]] are made by the federal government to ensure that reasonably uniform standards of services and taxation are kept between the richer and poorer provinces.

All provinces have [[unicameral]], elected [[Legislative Assemblies of Canada's provinces and territories|legislatures]] headed by a [[premier (Canada)|Premier]] selected in the same way as the Prime Minister of Canada. Each province also has a [[Lieutenant-Governor (Canada)|Lieutenant-Governor]] representing the [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen]], analogous to the Governor General of Canada, appointed on the recommendation of the Prime Minister of Canada, though with increasing levels of consultation with provincial governments in recent years.

==Geography and climate==
[[Image:Canada-satellite.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A satellite composite image of Canada. [[Boreal forest]]s prevail throughout the country, ice is prominent in the [[Arctic]] and through the [[Rocky Mountains|Rockies]], and the relatively flat [[Prairies]] facilitate agriculture.

{{main|Geography of Canada}}
Canada occupies most of the northern portion of [[North America]]. It shares land borders with the [[contiguous United States]] to the south and with the US state of [[Alaska]] to the northwest, stretching from the [[Atlantic Ocean]] in the east to the [[Pacific Ocean]] in the west; to the north lies the [[Arctic Ocean]]. Since 1925, Canada has claimed the portion of the Arctic between 60<U+00B0>W and 141<U+00B0>W [[longitude]];<ref name="territorial_evolution">{{cite web |author=National Resources Canada |publisher= National Resources Canada |url=http://atlas.gc.ca/site/english/maps/historical/territorialevolution/1927/1 |title=Territorial Evolution, 1927|date=[[2004-04-06]]|accessdate=2006-05-14}}</ref> this claim is not universally recognized. The northernmost settlement in Canada (and in the world) is [[CFS Alert|Canadian Forces Station (CFS) Alert]] on the northern tip of [[Ellesmere Island]]<U+2014>latitude 82.5<U+00B0>N<U+2014>just 834 kilometres (450 [[nautical mile]]s) from the North Pole. Canada is the world's second-largest country in total area, after [[Russia]].

The population density of 3.5 people per square kilometre (9.1/[[square mile|mi<U+00B2>]]) is among the lowest in the world.<ref name="population_density">{{cite web |author=WorldAtlas.com |publisher= WorldAtlas.com |url=http://worldatlas.com/aatlas/populations/ctydensityl.htm |title=Countries of the World  (by lowest population density) |date=2006-02 |accessdate=2006-05-16}}</ref> The most densely populated part of the country is the [[Quebec City-Windsor Corridor]] along the Great Lakes and Saint Lawrence River in the southeast. To the north of this region is the broad [[Canadian Shield]], an area of rock scoured clean by the [[Wisconsin glaciation|last ice age]], thinly soiled, rich in minerals, and dotted with lakes and rivers &mdash;

In eastern Canada, the Saint Lawrence River widens into the [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]], the world's largest [[estuary]]; the island of [[Newfoundland]] lies at its mouth.  South of the Gulf, the [[Canadian Maritimes]] protrude eastward from the southern coasts of Quebec.  [[New Brunswick]] and [[Nova Scotia]] are divided by the [[Bay of Fundy]], which experiences the world's largest tidal variations. [[Ontario]] and [[Hudson Bay]] dominate central Canada. West of Ontario, the broad, flat [[Canadian Prairies]] spread toward the [[Rocky Mountains]], which separate them from [[British Columbia]].

Northern Canadian vegetation tapers from [[coniferous]] forests to [[tundra]] and finally to Arctic barrens in the far north. The northern Canadian mainland is ringed with a vast [[Canadian Arctic islands|archipelago]] containing some of the world's largest islands.

Average winter and summer high temperatures across Canada range depending on the location.
Winters can be harsh in many regions of the country, particularly in the Prairie provinces, where daily average temperatures are near &minus;15 <U+00B0>[[Celsius|C]] (5 <U+00B0>[[Fahrenheit|F]]). <ref name="twn_regina">{{cite web |author=The Weather Network |authorlink=The Weather Network |publisher=The Weather Network |url=http://www.theweathernetwork.ca/weather/stats/pages/C02072.htm?CASK0261 |title=Statistics, Regina SK |accessdate=2006-05-18}}</ref> Coastal British Columbia is an exception and enjoys a temperate climate with a mild and rainy winter.

Average summer high temperatures across Canada range depending on the location.

==Economy==

:''Main articles: [[Economy of Canada]], [[Economic history of Canada]]

Canada is one of the world's wealthiest nations, a member of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) and [[Group of Eight]] (G8).  Canada is a [[free market]] economy with slightly more government intervention than the United States, but much less than most European nations. Canada has traditionally had a lower per capita [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) than its southern neighbour (whereas wealth has been more equally divided), but higher than the large western European economies. For the past decade, after a period of turbulence, the Canadian economy has been growing rapidly with low [[unemployment]] and large government surpluses on the [[Government of Canada|federal]] level.  Today Canada closely resembles the U.S. in its market-oriented economic system, pattern of production, and high living standards.  However there are internal regional variations in the Canadian economy &ndash; for example, unemployment varies among the provinces from 3.5% to 15.9%.<ref name="statcan_labour">{{cite web |author=Statistics Canada |authorlink= Statistics Canada |publisher= Statistics Canada |url=http://www.statcan.ca/english/Subjects/Labour/LFS/lfs-en.htm |title=Latest release from Labour Force Survey |date=[[2006-05-05]] |accessdate=2006-05-19}}</ref>

In the past century, the impressive growth of the manufacturing, mining, and service sectors has transformed the nation from a largely rural economy into one primarily industrial and urban.  As with other [[first world nation]]s, the Canadian economy is dominated by the [[service industry]], which employs about three quarters of Canadians.<ref name="cia_factbook">{{cite web |author=Central Intelligence Agency |publisher= Central Intelligence Agency |url=http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/ca.html |title=The World Factbook: Canada |date=[[2006-05-16]] |accessdate=2006-05-18}}</ref> However, Canada is unusual among developed countries in the importance of the [[primary industry|primary sector]], with the [[logging]] and [[petroleum|oil]] industries being two of Canada's most important.

Canada is one of the few developed nations that is a net exporter of energy.<ref name="cia_factbook" /> Canada has vast deposits of natural gas on the east coast and large oil and gas resources centred in Alberta, and also present in neighbouring British Columbia and Saskatchewan. The vast [[Athabasca Tar Sands]] give Canada the world's second largest reserves of oil.<ref name="athabasca">{{cite web |author=Clarke, Tony; Campbell, Bruce; Laxer, Gordon |publisher= Parkland Institute |url=http://www.ualberta.ca/PARKLAND/research/perspectives/LaxerClarkeCampbellMar06OpEd.htm |title=U.S. oil addiction could make us sick |date=[[2006-03-10]]|accessdate=2006-05-18}}</ref>  In Quebec and British Columbia, as well as Ontario and Manitoba, [[hydroelectric power]] is a cheap and relatively environmentally friendly source of abundant energy.

Canada is one of the world's most important suppliers of agricultural products, with the Canadian Prairies one of the most important suppliers of wheat and other grains.<ref name="ce_agriculture">{{cite web |author=The Canadian Encyclopedia |publisher= Historica Foundation of Canada |url=http://www.canadianencyclopedia.ca/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=J1SEC80771 |title=Agriculture and Food: Export markets |date=2006|accessdate=2006-05-18}}</ref> Canada is the world largest producer of zinc and uranium and a world leader in many other natural resources such as gold, nickel, aluminum, and lead;<ref name="ce_minig">{{cite web |author=The Canadian Encyclopedia |publisher= Historica Foundation of Canada |url=http://www.canadianencyclopedia.ca/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=A1SEC824436 |title=Canadian Mining |date=2006|accessdate=2006-05-18}}</ref> many, if not most, towns in the northern part of the country, where agriculture is difficult, exist because of a nearby mine or source of timber.  Canada also has a sizeable manufacturing sector, centred in southern Ontario, with the [[automobile industry]] especially important. 

In part due to the large primary sector Canada is highly dependent on [[international trade]], especially trade with the [[United States]].  The 1989 [[Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement]] (FTA) and 1994 [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) (which included Mexico) touched off a dramatic increase in trade and economic integration with the U.S. Since 2001, Canada has successfully avoided economic recession and has maintained the best overall economic performance in the G8.

==Demographics==
:''Main articles: [[Demographics of Canada]], [[List of cities in Canada]], [[List of Canadians by ethnicity]]''

The [[Canada 2001 Census|2001 national census]] recorded 30,007,094 people; the population is currently estimated by [[Statistics Canada]] to be 32.5 million people.<ref name="statscan_population_clock">{{cite web |author=Statistics Canada |authorlink=Statistics Canada |publisher= Statistics Canada |url=http://www.statcan.ca/english/edu/clock/population.htm |title=Canada's population clock|date=[[2006-02-14]]|accessdate=2006-05-14}}</ref> Population growth is largely accomplished through [[immigration]] and, to a lesser extent, natural growth. About three-quarters of Canada's population live within 160 kilometres (100 [[mile|mi]]) of the U.S. border. A similar proportion live in [[urban area]]s concentrated in the Quebec City-Windsor Corridor (notably the [[Toronto]]-[[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]], [[Montreal]], and [[National Capital Region (Canada)|Ottawa]] [[census metropolitan area]]s), the BC [[Lower Mainland]] ([[Vancouver]] and environs), and the [[Calgary-Edmonton Corridor]] in Alberta.

Canada is a very ethnically diverse nation. According to the 2001 census, it has 34 ethnic groups with at least one hundred thousand members each. Ancestries with more than 1 million people claiming them are [[English-Canadian|English]] (19.2%), [[French Canadian|French]] (15.7%), [[Scottish-Canadian|Scottish]] (14%), [[Irish-Canadian|Irish]] (12.9%), [[German-Canadian|German]] (9.0%), [[Italian Canadian|Italian]] (4.3%), [[Chinese Canadian|Chinese]] (3.5%), [[Ukrainian Canadian|Ukrainian]] (3.6%) and [[First Nations|aboriginal (North American Indian, M<U+00E9>tis, and Inuit)]] (3.4%).<ref name="statscan_ethnic">{{cite web |author=Statistics Canada |authorlink=Statistics Canada |publisher= Statistics Canada |url=http://www40.statcan.ca/l01/cst01/demo26a.htm |title=Population by selected ethnic origins, by provinces and territories|date=[[2005-01-25]]|accessdate=2006-05-14}}</ref> Canada's [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|aboriginal]] population is growing almost twice as fast as the rest of the Canadian population. In 2001, 13.4% of the population belonged to [[visible minorities]].

Canadians adhere to a [[Religion in Canada|wide variety of religions]]. According to the last census,<ref name="statscan_religion">{{cite web |author=Statistics Canada |authorlink=Statistics Canada |publisher= Statistics Canada |url=http://www40.statcan.ca/l01/cst01/demo30a.htm |title=Population by religion, by provinces and territories|date=[[2005-01-25]]|accessdate=2006-05-14}}</ref> 77.1% of Canadians identified as being [[Christianity|Christians]]; of this, [[Catholicism|Catholics]] make up the largest group (43.6% of Canadians). The largest protestant denomination is the [[United Church of Canada]]; about 17% of Canadians declared no religious affiliation, and the remaining 6.3% were affiliated with religions other than Christianity, of which the largest is [[Islam]].  

In Canada, the provinces and territories are responsible for education, thus Canada has no national department of education. Each of the 13 education systems are similar while reflecting their own regional history, culture and geography.<ref name="education">{{cite web | author =Council of Ministers of Canada | publisher = Education@Canada | title = General Overview of Education in Canada | url= http://www.educationcanada.cmec.ca/EN/EdSys/over.php | accessdate = 2006-05-22 }}</ref> The mandatory school age varies across Canada but generally ranges between the ages of 5-7 to 16-18,<ref name="education" /> contributing to an adult literacy rate that is 99%.<ref name="cia_factbook" /> Postsecondary education is the responsibility of the provincial and territorial governments that provide most of their funding; the federal government provides additional funding through research grants. In 2002, 43% of Canadians aged betwen 25 and 64 had post-secondary education; for those aged 25 to 34 the postsecondary attainment reaches 51%.<ref>{{cite web | author = Department of Finance | publisher = Department of Finance Canada | title = Creating Opportunities for All Canadians | url= http://www.fin.gc.ca/ec2005/agenda/agc4e.html| date = [[2005-11-14]] | accessdate = 2006-05-22}}</ref>

==Language==
[[Image:Mont.jpg|thumb|left|240px|The population of [[Montreal, Quebec|Montreal]] is predominantly [[francophone]], with a significant [[anglophone]] community.]]

:''Main articles: [[Language in Canada]], [[Bilingualism in Canada]]''
Canada's two official languages, [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]], are the [[mother tongue]]s of 59.7% and 23.2% of the population, respectively.<ref name="statscan_language">
{{cite web |author=Statistics Canada |authorlink=Statistics Canada |publisher= Statistics Canada |url=http://www40.statcan.ca/l01/cst01/demo11a.htm |title=Population by mother tongue, by province and territory|date=[[2005-01-27]]|accessdate=2006-05-14}}</ref> On [[July 7]], [[1969]], under the [[Official Languages Act (Canada)|Official Languages Act]], French was made commensurate to English throughout the federal government. This started a process that led to Canada redefining itself as an officially "bilingual" nation.

English and French have equal status in federal courts, Parliament, and in all federal institutions. The public has the right, where there is sufficient demand, to receive federal government services in either English or French. While multiculturalism is official policy, to become a citizen one must be able to speak either English or French, and 98.5% of Canadians speak at least one (English only: 67.5%, French only: 13.3%, both: 17.7%).<ref name="statscan_language2">{{cite web |author=Statistics Canada |authorlink=Statistics Canada |publisher= Statistics Canada |url=http://www40.statcan.ca/l01/cst01/demo15a.htm |title=Population by knowledge of official language, by province and territory|date=[[2005-01-27]]|accessdate=2006-05-14}}</ref>

French is mostly spoken in Quebec, but there are substantial francophone populations in parts of New Brunswick, eastern and northern Ontario and southern Manitoba. Of those who speak French as a first language, 85% live in Quebec. French is the official language of Quebec. New Brunswick is the only bilingual province in the country. English is the official language in all other provinces. Several aboriginal languages have official status in Northwest Territories. [[Inuktitut]] is the majority language in Nunavut, and one of three official languages in the territory.

Non-official languages are important in Canada, with 5,202,245 people listing one as a first language.<ref name="statscan_language" /> Important non-official first languages include [[Chinese language|Chinese]] (853,745 first-language speakers), [[Italian language|Italian]] (469,485), [[German language|German]] (438,080), and [[Punjabi]] (271,220).<ref name="statscan_language" />

:''Main articles: [[Culture of Canada]], [[Canadian identity]], [[National symbols of Canada]], [[Sport in Canada]]''
Canadian culture has historically been heavily influenced by [[English people|English]], [[French people|French]], [[Irish people|Irish]], [[Scottish people|Scottish]] and [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Aboriginal]] cultures and traditions, and over time has been greatly influenced by American culture due to its proximity and the interchange of [[human capital]]. Many forms of American media and entertainment are popular, if not dominant in Canada; conversely, many Canadian cultural products and entertainers are successful in the US and worldwide.  Many cultural products are now marketed toward a unified "North American" market, or a global market generally. 

The creation and preservation of more distinctly Canadian culture has been partly influenced by federal government programs, laws and institutions such as the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] (CBC), the [[National Film Board of Canada]] (NFB), and the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC).

Canadian culture has also been greatly influenced by more recent immigration of people from all over the world. Many Canadians value [[multiculturalism]], indeed some see Canadian culture as being inherently multicultural.<ref name="bickerton" /> Multicultural heritage is enshrined in [[Section Twenty-seven of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Section 27 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]].
[[Image:Haida Totem pole.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A [[Haida]] [[totem pole]] and [[Native American long house|long house]] in [[Victoria, BC]].]]
[[National symbols of Canada|National symbology]] is influenced by natural, historical, and [[First Nations]] sources.  Particularly, the use of the [[maple leaf]], as a Canadian symbol, dates back to the early 18th century and is depicted on its [[Flag of Canada|current]] and [[Red Ensign|previous]] flags, the [[penny (Canadian coin)|penny]], and on the [[Coat of Arms of Canada|coat of arms]]. Other prominent symbols include the [[beaver]], [[Canada goose]], [[common loon]], [[Monarchy in Canada|the Crown]], and the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police|RCMP]].

Canada's official national sports are [[ice hockey]] (winter) and [[lacrosse]] (summer). Hockey is a national pastime, and is by far the most popular spectator sport in the country. Canada's six largest metropolitan areas have franchises in the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL), and there are more Canadian players in the league than from all other countries combined. Other popular Canadian sports include [[curling]] and [[Canadian football]] (especially the [[Canadian Football League]]). [[Soccer]], [[basketball]] and [[baseball]] are widely played at youth and amateur levels, but professional leagues and franchises are not as widespread. Canada will host the [[2010 Winter Olympics]] in [[Vancouver]] and [[Whistler, BC]].
