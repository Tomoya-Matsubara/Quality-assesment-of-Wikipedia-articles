The '''Alban Hills''' {{in it|Colli Albani}} are the site of a quiescent  [[volcano|volcanic complex]] in [[Italy]], located {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} southeast of [[Rome]] and  about {{convert|24|km|mi|abbre=on}} north of [[Anzio, Italy|Anzio]].

The dominant peak (but not the highest) is ''[[Monte Cavo]]''.  There are two small [[caldera]]s which contain [[lake]]s, [[Lago Albano]] and [[Lake Nemi]]. The rock of the hills is called Peperino (lapis albanus) a particular [[Tuff]], a combination of ash and small rocks that is useful for construction, and provides a mineral-rich substrate for [[grape]] vines.

==History==
The area was inhabited by the [[Latini]] during the 5th to 3rd centuries BC. The ancient [[Rome|Romans]] called them '''Albanus Mons'''.  On the summit was the [[sanctuary]] of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] Latiaris, in which the [[consul]]s celebrated the ''[[Feriae Latinae]]'', and several [[general]]s celebrated victories here when they were not accorded regular [[Roman Triumph|triumph]]s in Rome.  The temple has not survived, but the ''Via Triumphalis'' leading up to it may still be seen.

The hills, especially around the shores of the lakes, have been popular since prehistoric times.  From the 9th to 7th century BC there were numerous villages (see the legendary [[Alba Longa]] and [[Tusculum]]). In Roman times these villages were inhabited as a way to escape the heat and crowds of Rome, and there are many [[villa]]s and country houses.

==Towns and cities==
{{main|Castelli Romani}}
The towns and villages in the Alban Hills are known as the Castelli Romani.

==Volcanic activity==
Examination of deposits have dated the two most recent eruptions to around 37,000 and 41,000&nbsp;years ago. The area exhibits small localised [[earthquake]] swarms, [[bradyseism]], and release of [[carbon dioxide]] and [[hydrogen sulphide]] into the atmosphere. The uplift and earthquake swarms have been interpreted as caused by a slowly growing spherical [[magma chamber]] 5-6&nbsp;kilometres below the surface; some think that it may erupt again; if so, there is risk to [[Rome]], which is only 25 to 30&nbsp;km away.

There is documentary evidence of an [[eruption]] in [[114 BC]], but the absence of [[holocene]] geological deposits has largely discredited it as a volcanic event and instead the account is considered to be a description of a [[forest fire]].

The volcano emits large amounts of [[carbon dioxide]]. This can potentially reach lethal concentrations if it accumulates in depressions in the ground in the absence of [[wind]]. The [[asphyxiation]] of 29 [[cow]]s in September 1999 prompted a detailed survey, which found that concentration of the gas at 1.5&nbsp;m above the ground in a residential area on the northwestern flank sometimes exceeded the occupational health threshold of 0.5%. Eight [[sheep]] were killed in a similar incident in October 2001.
