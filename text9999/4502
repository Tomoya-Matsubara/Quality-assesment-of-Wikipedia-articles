"'''Elysium (I Go Crazy)'''" (sometimes called ''Elysium'') is the 5th single by [[Liverpool]] [[electronic dance music|Dance]] trio [[Ultrabeat]]. It was released in 2006 and played throughout the summer of that year. Ultrabeat used the vocals of Rebecca Rudd to [[Scott Brown (DJ)|Scott Brown]]'s [[UK hardcore|hardcore]] cult hit "Elysium" and gave it a [[Trance music|trance]] remix, achieving further commercial success for a song which is perceived by many [[UK hardcore|hardcore]] fans as a great [[electronic dance music|dance]] anthem. 

The song represented a bit of a change in style for [[Ultrabeat]] as this song and "[[Sure Feels Good]]" were slightly more [[UK hardcore|hardcore]] songs than previous Ultrabeat singles, as they were both collaborations with [[UK hardcore|hardcore]] artists.

It reached #38 in the [[UK Singles Chart]] and got #1 in the [[MTV Dance]] Galaxy Chart.

==Music Video==
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Ultrabeat E(IGC).JPG|thumb|Screenshot of the video.]] -->
The video was filmed in 2006 and was directed by Mike Cockayne. It shows a crowd of people in a nightclub waiting for Rebecca Rudd, the only  barmaid, to serve them. She is singing the words to the song. When she sees a man she likes chatting to another woman she smashes a glass on the floor along with a bar full of glasses. She then climbs on to the bar, looking down on the crowd and still singing the song. She Jumps into the crowd and 'crowd surfs' on her back.

She is then on a small platform singing the song with two other dancers, while the crowd is dancing. The video then switches between Rebecca Rudd singing, the two dancers, the crowd dancing, and Rebecca Rudd 'crowd surfing' before it shows Rebecca Rudd cleaning up the empty bar (indicating her being left alone again) and a single dancer on the empty platform at the end of the video.

==Trivia==
*The single was consistently mistitled as "Elysium - I Go Crazy" (i.e. a song called "I Go Crazy" by an artist or group called "Elysium"), leading to this being its name on playlists/charts from [[MTV Dance]] and similar stations.  It is also mistitled as "Don't Leave Me Hangin'"; the name being taken from the lyrics of the single.
