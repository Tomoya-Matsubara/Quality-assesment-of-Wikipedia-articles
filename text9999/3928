'''Ernest Georg Aberg''' (1823<U+2013>1907) was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] physician. Born in [[Stockholm]], Sweden in 1823, he practiced as a doctor in Stockholm initially, but having contracted [[tuberculosis]], around 1955 he emigrated to [[Argentina]] in search of a warmer [[climate]]. He continued to practice in Argentina, founded a [[gymnastics]] institute, and was consulted on [[sanitation|sanitary]] problems by the Argentinian government on a number of occasions. He also developed an interest in the establishment of ''[[Eucalyptus]]'' in the [[La Plata Partido]], prompting [[Ferdinand von Mueller]] to name ''Eucalyptus abergiana'' (now ''[[Corymbia abergiana]]'') in his honour in 1878. He returned to Stockholm around 1877, later moved to [[Switzerland]], and returned to [[Buenos Aires]] in the late 1890s. He died there in 1907.
