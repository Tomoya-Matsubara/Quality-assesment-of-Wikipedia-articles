==Early years==

Emilio Albert De La Garza, Jr. was born on [[23 June]] [[1949]], in [[East Chicago, Indiana]], and graduated from Washington High School there in 1968. For a year, he was employed by Inland Steel in East Chicago.

==Marine Corps career==

He received recruit training with the 2nd Recruit Training Battalion, Recruit Training Regiment at the [[Marine Corps Recruit Depot, San Diego|Marine Corps Recruit Depot]], [[San Diego, California]].

Upon completion of recruit training, he was ordered to the Marine Corps Base, [[Camp Pendleton]], California, where he joined the 2nd Infantry Training Regiment and underwent individual combat training with the 1st and 2nd Battalions, and weapons training with the Basic Infantry Training Battalion.

Promoted to [[private first class]] on [[1 July]] [[1969]], he arrived in the [[Republic of Vietnam]] on the [[25 July]] [[1969]] for duty as an ammo carrier with Company H, [[2nd Battalion, 3rd Marines]], [[3rd Marine Division]].

Corporal De La Garza then joined Company E, 2nd Battalion, 1st Marines, 1st Marine Division. While serving as a machine gunner on a squad size patrol with the 3nd Platoon of Company E, approximately four miles south of [[Da Nang]] on [[11 April]] [[1970]], he was mortally wounded by a grenade as he placed himself between the blast and two fellow Marines.

His medals and decorations include: the Medal of Honor, the [[Purple Heart]], the Combat Action Ribbon, the National Defense Service Medal, the Vietnam Service Medal with one bronze star, and the Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal.

LANCE CORPORAL EMILIO A. DE LA GARZA, JR.<br>
UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS
</center>
for service as set forth in the following CITATION:
<blockquote>
For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty while serving as a machine gunner with Company E, Second Battalion, First Marines, First Marine Division, in the Republic of Vietnam on [[April 11]], [[1970]]. Returning with his squad from a night ambush operation, Lance Corporal De La Garza joined his Platoon commander and another Marine in searching for two enemy soldiers who had been observed fleeing for cover toward a small pond. Moments later, he located one of the enemy soldiers hiding among the reeds and brush. As the three Marines attempted to remove the resisting soldier from the pond, Lance Corporal De La Garza observed him pull the pin on a [[hand grenade|grenade]]. Shouting a warning, Lance Corporal De La Garza placed himself between the other two Marines and the ensuing blast from the grenade, thereby saving the lives of his comrades at the sacrifice of his own. By his prompt and decisive action, and his great personal valor in the face of almost certain death, Lance Corporal De La Garza upheld and further enhanced the finest traditions of the Marine Corps and the [[United States Navy|United States Naval Service]].
