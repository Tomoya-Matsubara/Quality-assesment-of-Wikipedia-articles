The [[main event]] scripted into Taboo Tuesday was between [[John Cena]] and [[Kurt Angle]] for the [[WWE Championship]], in which Cena would also defend the title against the fans' choice of three possible opponents: Kane ([[Glenn Jacobs]]), The Big Show ([[Paul Wight]]), and [[Shawn Michaels]]. The buildup to the match began at [[Unforgiven (2005)|Unforgiven]], Raw's previous pay-per-view event, Cena intentionally [[Professional wrestling#Disqualification|disqualified]] himself.

One of the featured [[undercard|preliminary]] matches was between [[Ric Flair]] versus Triple H ([[Triple H|Paul Levesque]]) for the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship]].

Another preliminary match was between the Raw and SmackDown! brands. The feud began on the October 3 episode of ''Raw'', in which WWE Chairman [[Vince McMahon]] wanted a match between SmackDown! wrestlers on the program.<ref name="October 3" /> After the match started, Eric Bischoff came out and announced that McMahon had left the arena and placed himself in charge. Seeing SmackDown! as inferior, Bischoff stopped the match by turning off the lights and going to a [[Television advertisement|commercial break]].<ref name="October 3" /> At the end of the broadcast, [[Professional wrestling authority figures#General managers 2|SmackDown! General Manager]] [[Theodore Long]], led SmackDown! superstars to the ring, and they fought with Raw superstars. On the October 17 episode of ''Raw'', [[John Layfield|John "Bradshaw" Layfield]]'s (JBL) (SmackDown!) entrance music played during Edge's ([[Adam Copeland]]) (Raw) match, the distraction caused Edge to lose the match.<ref name="October 17" /><ref name="Oct. 17" /> As part of the storyline, Edge and Chris Masters showed up to the SmackDown! program on the October 21 episode, in which they interfered in a match between JBL and Rey Mysterio ([[Rey Mysterio, Jr.|Oscar Gutierrez]]), where they assaulted Mysterio.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/archive/10212005/ |title=A Raw invasion |date=2005-10-21 |publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]|accessdate=2008-05-10 }}</ref> On the October 24 episode of ''Raw'', a match was made between Edge and Masters, and two of five SmackDown! superstars chosen by the fans, and Mysterio attacked Edge from behind.<ref name="October 24" /><ref name="Oct. 24" /> The following week, Bischoff invited Mysterio to the ''Raw'' program to take the ''[[WWE Raw#Recurring segments|Master Lock Challenge]]'', a challenge where the wrestler must break free from Master's [[Professional wrestling holds#Full nelson|full Nelson]] [[Professional wrestling#Submission|submission]] hold, which he calls the Master Lock.<ref name="October 24" /><ref name="Oct. 24" /> Mysterio, however, attacked Masters instead, which caused Bischoff to call for other Raw superstars.

==Event==
Before Taboo Tuesday aired live on [[pay-per-view]], Kerwin White ([[Chavo Guerrero, Jr.|Salvador Guerrero III]]) and Matt Striker ([[Matthew Kaye]]) defeated [[Shelton Benjamin]] and Val Venis ([[Sean Morley]]) in a [[tag team]] match taped for ''[[WWE Heat]]'', one of WWE's secondary television programs.<ref name="pwh">{{cite news|url=http://prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wwf/taboo.html#2005|title=WWE Taboo Tuesday|date=2005-11-01|publisher=Pro Wrestling History|accessdate=2009-01-01}}</ref>

===Preliminary matches===
The first televised match was a tag team match in which Edge and Chris Masters (representing Raw) faced off against Rey Mysterio and [[Matt Hardy]] (representing SmackDown!). Before the match, it was revealed that Edge refused to wrestle, saying he did not care about representing Raw and choosing Snitsky ([[Gene Snitsky]]) as his replacement.<ref name=slam/><ref name="hoffco" /> Masters and Snitsky quickly gained the early advantage in the match, as they took the upper hand over Mysterio. Mysterio fought back with a [[Professional wrestling holds#Tilt-a-whirl|tilt-a-whirl]], a counter attack hold. Afterwards, Hardy and Snitsky were tagged in, leading to Hardy getting the advantage as he [[Powerslam#Side slam|grabbed Snitsky by the side]] and [[DDT (professional wrestling)|drove Snitsky's head]] onto the wrestling mat. Back and forth action took place between both teams. The match ended when Mysterio performed the [[Professional wrestling attacks#Tiger feint kick|619]] on Masters, followed by Hardy [[Cutter (professional wrestling)#Twist of Fate|grabbing Snitsky's head in a forward position and forcefully pulling it down over his shoulders]]. Mysterio [[Pin (professional wrestling)|pinned]] Masters and giving SmackDown! the win over Raw.<ref name=slam/><ref name="hoffco">{{cite news|url=http://www.hoffco-inc.com/wwe/ppv/ppv/tt05.html|title=WWE Taboo Tuesday 2005 |date=2005-11-01|publisher=Hoffco|accessdate=2009-01-05}}</ref>

The next match was another tag team match involving [[Rob Conway]] and Tyson Tomko ([[Travis Tomko]]) versus Eugene ([[Nick Dinsmore]]) and [[Jimmy Snuka]], who won the fans' vote with 42%. The team of Conway and Tomko dominated Eugene in the early start of the match. Eugene, however, fought back by avoiding Tomko's attacks. Eugene tagged Snuka in and performed a series of [[Professional wrestling attacks#Backhand chop|chops]] to Conway's chest and [[Professional wrestling attacks#Headbutt|headbutted]] him in the process. In retaliation, Tomko attacked Snuka from behind, but Eugene fought him off, as he [[Professional wrestling attacks#Clothesline|extended his arm out]] and knocked him out of the ring and out of the match. Eugene performed a [[Professional wrestling throws#Sitout Jawbreaker|jawbreaker]] on Conway, which proceeded with Eugene to [[Powerslam#Side slam|lift Conway by holding his back horizontally and slamming]] it down, termed as a side slam. Snuka covered Conway for the pinfall victory. After the match, Tomko attacked Snuka and Eugene until [[Jim Duggan]] and Kamala ([[Kamala (wrestler)|James Harris]]) came down and fought off Tomko.<ref name=slam/><ref name="hoffco" />

[[Image:Mick-foley-at-signing.jpg|thumb|right|Mick Foley who was scheduled in a match against Carlito]]
The third match was between Carlito and Mankind ([[Mick Foley]]), which was the gimmick chosen for Foley by the fans' vote with 52%. The match began with Carlito performing a [[dropkick]] on Mankind. Mankind, however, got the advantage over Carlito. Mid-way through the match, Mankind tried to use a [[Folding chair|steel chair]] on Carlito, but Carlito  avoided getting hit, as he executed a [[Professional wrestling throws#Drop toe-hold|drop toe-hold]], sending Mankind to hit the steel steps. Mankind rose to his feet, which led Carlito to perform a standing dropkick, resulting in Mankind to hit the back of his head into the steel steps. Back in the ring, Mankind received the upper hand after he [[DDT (professional wrestling)#Double underhook DDT|bended Carlito forward and hooked each arm behind Carlito's back, tucked his head under one of Mankind's arms, and then fell back to pull Carlito]] down flat on his face which caused Carlito to roll over. He then forced Carlito to [[Professional wrestling#Submission|submit]] with the [[Mandible Claw]] and win the match.<ref name=slam/><ref name="hoffco" />

The voting results for John Cena and Kurt Angle's opponent for the WWE Championship were then revealed, with Shawn Michaels winning. Kane and The Big Show, who were also contenders for the WWE title match, faced the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|World Tag Team Champions]] [[Lance Cade and Trevor Murdoch]] (Lance Cade <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Lance Cade|Lance McNaught]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> and Trevor Murdoch <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[William Mueller]]<nowiki>]</nowiki>) for the World Tag Team titles. The match began with Kane and The Big Show dominating Cade and Murdoch early on. Cade and Murdoch fought back after Murdoch shoved Kane off the top turnbuckle. They performed a [[Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers#Lariat, running chop block combination|running chop block combination on Kane]] and taking the upper hand. The Big Show, who was tagged in, stood at {{convert|7|ft|0|in|m}} and weighed {{convert|500|lb|kg}}, used his body size to his advantage as he [[squash (professional wrestling)|squashed]], or easily and quickly performed moves on, Cade and Murdoch. The match concluded after Kane and the Big Show [[Chokeslam#Double chokeslam|grabbed and lifted Cade by the throat and slammed him down]] into the mat, a move called the chokeslam. This allowed the Big Show to pin Cade and become the new World Tag Team champions with Kane. After the match, Kane and the Big Show double teamed Murdoch, as they performed a chokeslam.<ref name=slam/><ref name="hoffco" />

[[Image:Batista with World Heavyweight Championship.jpg|thumb|upright|Batista, who faced off against Jonathan Coachman at Taboo Tuesday]]
The next match was a [[Professional wrestling match types#Hardcore-based variations|Street Fight]], a match without disqualifications and where scoring conditions can occur anywhere, between [[Jonathan Coachman]] and SmackDown! [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Champion]] Batista ([[Dave Batista|Dave Bautista]]). Goldust ([[Dustin Rhodes|Virgil Runnels III]]) and Vader ([[Big Van Vader|Leon White]]), were scripted to take part in the match, on behalf of Coachman. In the beginning of the match, Batista fought both Goldust and Vader, where they proceeded to beat him down in the corner. Batista, however, fought back with a series of [[Professional wrestling attacks#Spear|shoulder block takedowns]]. Coachman, who stood on the outside, entered the ring, in which Batista performed a clothesline on him. Batista attempted to perform a [[suplex]] on Vader, a move that consists of one wrestler picking up his opponent off the ground and then using a large portion of his or her own body weight to drive the opponent down on the mat, but Goldust managed to hit Batista with a [[Shinai|kendo stick]]. This allowed Coachman to receive the advantage over Batista. The match concluded after Batista performed a [[Powerbomb#Sitout powerbomb|sitout powerbomb]] on Coachman, a move Batista calls the Batista Bomb, to gain the win.<ref name=slam/><ref name="hoffco" />

The sixth match was a [[Battle royal (professional wrestling)|Battle Royal]], a multi-competitor [[Professional wrestling match types|match type]] in which wrestlers are eliminated until one is left and declared the winner, for the [[WWE Women's Championship]] between Ashley ([[Ashley Massaro]]), Candice Michelle ([[Candice Michelle|Candice Beckman-Ehrlich]]), [[Mickie James]], Victoria ([[Lisa Marie Varon]]), Maria ([[Maria Kanellis]]) and [[Trish Stratus]], all of whom wore [[lingerie]], which was voted by the fans' with 43%. In the match, James, as part of a storyline angle involving her being a devoted fan of Stratus, saved Stratus from being eliminated from the match, after Victoria tried eliminating her. Maria was tossed over the top rope by Stratus and James, thus being the first to be eliminated. Afterward, Michelle applied a submission move on Ashley on the top rope. Michelle turned around and was knocked off the ring apron by Ashley, making the second elimination of the match. Following the elimination of Michelle, Ashley was then eliminated by Victoria. The match concluded after Victoria hesitantly tried to eliminate Stratus, but James stopped her from doing so. James eliminated herself along with Victoria to allow Stratus to win and retain her Women's title.<ref name=slam/><ref name="hoffco" />

===Main event matches===
The main match was a singles match between Ric Flair and Triple H. The match was a Steel Cage match, which gained 83% of the vote. During the match, Triple H sent Flair head-first into the steel cage, causing Flair to bleed from the head, the blood loss results from previous cuts that wrestlers perform before a match called [[List of professional wrestling terms#B|blading]]. A spot in the match saw Triple H retrieve a steel chain in which he wrapped around his fist and attempted a [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Diving fist drop|diving fist drop]] from the top turnbuckle. Flair, however, countered as he raised his foot to hit Triple H in the face and performed a series of chops to Triple H's chest. Triple H controlled most of the match, until he attempted to apply the [[Professional wrestling holds#Figure four leglock|figure four leglock]], a signature move of Flair's, which resulted in Flair sending him towards the steel cage. Flair followed this by [[Professional wrestling attacks#Biting|biting]] the head of Triple H, resulting in him bleeding from his forehead, this often results when a wrestler is trapped, either in a corner of the ring or in a submission hold, as a desperation move. The match concluded after Flair reversed a move where Triple H would have [[Facebuster#Double underhook facebuster|tucked his head between his knees and jumped up]] to slam his head to the mat, with a [[Professional wrestling throws#Back body drop|back body drop]] and three chair shots to the head. This allowed Flair to escape through the steel cage door to win the match and thus retain his Intercontinental title.<ref name=slam/>
[[Image:Shawn Michaels in England.jpg|thumb|upright|Shawn Michaels, who was voted to be part of the Triple Threat match for the WWE Championship]]

The main event was the WWE Championship match, in which John Cena defended the title against Kurt Angle and Shawn Michaels, who received the fans' vote to be part of the Triple Threat match. During the beginning of the match, Cena performed a back body drop on Angle, sending him to outside. Michaels, who had been thrown out of the ring, received the upper hand over Cena until Angle returned to the match and performed a variety of suplexes on both Michaels and Cena. Mid-way in the match, Angle and Michaels double teamed Cena, lifting him in the air crashing face-first on the Spanish announce table. Back in the ring, Angle [[Professional wrestling throws#Olympic slam|lifted Michaels on his shoulders and spinned 90<U+00B0>]] to slam him down to the mat, a move Angle calls the Angle Slam, from the top of the turnbuckles. Angle then tried to apply the [[Professional wrestling holds#Ankle lock|ankle lock]] hold on Michaels, but Cena came into the ring and clotheslined Angle out of the ring. Cena proceeded by executing a back body drop on Michaels and attempting to perform a [[Professional wrestling attacks#Fist drop|fist drop]] with theatrics, but was pulled out of the ring by Angle, who tossed him over the security barricade. The match concluded when Angle caught Cena in the ankle lock. Michaels, who was on the outside, climbed the top rope and [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Diving elbow drop|drove his cocked elbow onto Angle's chest]], who was laying on the mat holding onto Cena's ankle. Michaels performed a [[superkick]], which saw the sole of his foot strike Angle's chin, a move in which Michaels calls Sweet Chin Music. Following this, Cena lifted Michaels over his shoulders and threw him down to execute the [[Professional wrestling throws#Fireman's carry takeover|FU]]. Cena got the pinfall victory and thus retained his title.<ref name=slam/>
