'''Z11 ''Bernd von Arnim''''' was a {{sclass2|Type 1934A|destroyer}} built for the German Navy (''Kriegsmarine'') in the late 1930s. At the beginning of [[World War II]], the ship was initially deployed to [[blockade]] the Polish coast, but she was quickly transferred to the [[German Bight]] to lay minefields in German waters. In late 1939 the ship made one successful [[minelaying]] [[sortie]] off the English coast that claimed one British warship and seven merchant ships. During the early stages of the [[Norwegian Campaign]], ''Bernd von Arnim'' fought the British destroyer {{HMS|Glowworm|H92|2}} while transporting troops to the [[Narvik]] area in early April 1940, but neither ship was damaged during the action. The ship fought in both naval [[Battles of Narvik]] several days later and had to be [[scuttled]] after she exhausted her ammunition.

==Design and description==
''Bernd von Arnim'' had an [[length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|119|m|ftin|sp=us}} and was {{convert|114|m|ftin|sp=us}} [[Length at the waterline|long at the waterline]]. The ship had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|11.3|m|ftin|sp=us}}, and a maximum [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|4.23|m|ftin|sp=us}}. She displaced {{convert|2171|t|LT|lk=on|sp=us}} at [[Displacement_(ship)#Standard_displacement|standard]] and {{convert|3190|t|LT|sp=us}} at [[deep load]]. The Wagner geared [[steam turbine]]s were designed to produce {{convert|70000|shp|lk=on|0}} which would propel the ship at {{convert|36|kn|link=on}}. Steam was provided to the turbines by six high-pressure Benson [[boiler (steam generator)|boiler]]s<ref name=g9>Groener, p. 199</ref> with [[superheater]]s. ''Bernd von Arnim'' carried a maximum of {{convert|752|t|LT|0|sp=us}} of [[fuel oil]] which was intended to give a range of {{convert|4400|nmi|lk=on}} at {{convert|19|kn}}, but the ship proved top-heavy in service and 30% of the fuel had to be retained as [[Sailing ballast|ballast]] low in the ship.<ref name=w8>Whitley, p. 18</ref> The effective range proved to be only {{convert|1530|nmi|abbr=on|lk=on}} at {{convert|19|kn}}.<ref>Koop and Schmolke, p. 26</ref>

''Bernd von Arnim'' carried five [[12.7 cm SK C/34 naval gun|12.7 cm SK C/34 guns]] in single mounts with [[gun shield]]s, two each [[superfire|superimposed]], fore and aft. The fifth gun was carried on top of the rear deckhouse. Her [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] armament consisted of four [[3.7 cm SK C/30]] guns in two twin mounts abreast the rear [[funnel (ship)|funnel]] and six [[2 cm FlaK 30/38/Flakvierling|2 cm C/30]] guns in single mounts. The ship carried eight above-water {{convert|53.3|cm|in|adj=on|sp=us}} [[torpedo tube]]s in two power-operated mounts.<ref name=g9/><ref name=w8/> Four [[depth charge]] throwers were mounted on the sides of the rear deckhouse and they were supplemented by six racks for individual depth charges on the sides of the stern. Enough depth charges were carried for either two or four patterns of 16 charges each.<ref>Whitley, p. 215</ref> Mine rails could be fitted on the rear deck that had a maximum capacity of 60 [[Naval mine|mines]].<ref name=g9/> 'GHG' (''Gruppenhorchger<U+00E4>t'') passive [[hydrophone]]s were fitted to detect [[submarine]]s.<ref>Whitley, pp. 71<U+2013>72</ref>

==Career==
{{seealso|Battles of Narvik}}
The ship was ordered on 4 August 1934 and [[Keel|laid down]] at [[Friedrich Krupp Germaniawerft|Germania]], [[Kiel]] on 26 March 1935 as yard number G537. She was [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 8 July 1936 and completed on 6 July 1938.<ref>Whitley, p. 204</ref> When World War II began in September 1939, ''Bernd von Arnim'' was initially deployed in the Baltic to operate against the [[Polish Navy]] and to enforce a [[blockade]] of Poland,<ref name=ks1>Koop and Schmolke, p. 91</ref> but she was soon transferred to the German Bight where she joined her [[sister ship|sisters]] in laying defensive minefields. The ship also patrolled the [[Skagerrak]] to inspect neutral shipping for contraband goods.<ref>Rohwer, pp. 2<U+2013>3, 5, 7</ref> ''Bernd von Arnim'' joined the other destroyers in laying [[minefield]]s off the British coast in November, when ''Bernd von Arnim'', [[German destroyer Z19 Hermann K<U+00FC>nne|''Hermann K<U+00FC>nne'']] and [[German destroyer Z21 Wilhelm Heidkamp|''Wilhelm Heidkamp'']]<ref>Rohwer, p. 9</ref> laid about 180 [[magnetic mine]]s<ref name=w9>Whitley, p. 89</ref> in the middle of the [[Thames Estuary]] on the night of 17/18 November. The destroyer {{HMS|Gipsy|H63|6}}, one [[trawler]], and seven other ships totalling 27,565 [[Gross Register Tons]] (GRT) were sunk by this minefield.<ref>Hervieux, p. 112</ref> Four days later, she was one of the destroyers escorting the [[battleship]]s {{ship|German battleship|Gneisenau||2}} and {{ship|German battleship|Scharnhorst||2}} through the [[North Sea]] to break out into the North Atlantic.<ref name=ks1/> Together with her sisters [[German destroyer Z10 Hans Lody|''Hans Lody'']] and [[German destroyer Z12 Erich Giese|''Erich Giese'']], ''Bernd von Arnim'' was to lay a minefield off [[Cromer]] during the night of 6/7 December, but she had trouble with two of her boilers and had to shut them down. The ship was ordered to return to port while the other two destroyers continued their mission.<ref>Whitley, pp. 89<U+2013>90</ref>

===Norwegian Campaign===
''Bernd von Arnim'' was allocated to Group 1 for the Norwegian portion of [[Operation Weser<U+00FC>bung]] in April 1940. The group's task was to transport the 139th Mountain Infantry Regiment (''139. Gebirgsj<U+00E4>ger Regiment'') and the headquarters of the [[3rd Mountain Division (Germany)|3rd Mountain Division]] (''3. Gebirgs-Division'') to seize [[Narvik]]. The ships began loading troops on 6 April and set sail the next day.<ref>Whitley, p. 96</ref> ''Bernd von Arnim'' was spotted by the British destroyer {{HMS|Glowworm|H92|2}} in a storm on the morning of 8 April and the ship turned away to the north-west at full speed after laying a [[smoke screen]]. The German ship was suffering damage from the heavy seas at {{convert|35|kn}} and was forced to reduce speed to {{convert|27|kn}} after she had lost two men overboard. The British destroyer was better suited for the conditions and began to close on ''Bernd von Arnim''. [[Lieutenant Commander]] (''Korvettenkapit<U+00E4>n'') Curt Rechel, captain of ''von Arnim'', turned his ship to the north-east, closer to the [[heavy cruiser]] {{ship|German cruiser|Admiral Hipper||2}}. The ships exchanged fire without effect for an hour until ''Hipper'' came within range and sank ''Glowworm'' shortly afterward.<ref>Haarr, pp. 91<U+2013>93</ref>

The German destroyers reached the [[Ofotfjord]] on the morning of 9 April and Commodore [[Friedrich Bonte]] took his [[flagship]] [[German destroyer Z21 Wilhelm Heidkamp|''Wilhelm Heidkamp'']], ''Bernd von Arnim'' and [[German destroyer Z2 Georg Thiele|''Georg Thiele'']] down the fjord to Narvik.<ref>Haarr, p. 323</ref> A heavy snowstorm allowed ''von Arnim'' and ''Thiele'' to enter the harbor without challenge and tie up at a [[pier]]. The mountain troops immediately began disembarking, but the ship was spotted by the [[coast defense ship]] {{HNoMS|Norge||2}} a few minutes later. The latter ship immediately opened fire and was able to fire approximately 13 shells at {{convert|600|-|800|m|yd|sp=us}} range before ''von Arnim'' was able to fire seven torpedoes.<ref name=h7/> Only two struck the Norwegian ship, but they detonated one or more of the ship's [[magazine (artillery)|magazine]]s and she immediately [[capsized]] and sank. None of the Norwegian shells hit either of the two German destroyers due to the darkness and falling snow, despite the short range. ''Von Arnim'' lowered boats to rescue the surviving Norwegian sailors and was able to pick up 96 men together with boats from the merchantmen in harbor.<ref name=h7>Haarr, pp. 327</ref>

[[File:UK-NWE-Norway-2.jpg|left|thumb|A map of the Ofotfjord|400px]]
''Von Arnim'' and ''Thiele'' were the first to refuel from the single tanker that had made it safely to Narvik<ref>Haarr, p. 334</ref> and later moved to the Ballangenfjord, a southern arm of the Ofotfjord, closer to the entrance.<ref>Whitley, p. 99</ref> Shortly before dawn on 10 April, the five destroyers of the British [[2nd Destroyer Flotilla]] surprised the five German destroyers in Narvik harbor. They torpedoed two destroyers and badly damaged the other three while suffering only minor damage themselves. As they were beginning to withdraw they encountered the three destroyers of the 4th Flotilla which had been alerted in the Herjansfjord when the British began their attack. The Germans opened fire first, but the gunnery for both sides was not effective due to the mist and the smoke screen laid by the British as they retreated down the Ofotfjord. The German ships had to turn away to avoid a [[salvo]] of three torpedoes fired by one of the destroyers in Narvik, but ''von Arnim'' and ''Thiele'' had also been alerted and were coming up to engage the British.<ref>Harr, pp. 339<U+2013>43</ref>

The two German destroyers [[Crossing the T|crossed the T]] of the British flotilla and were able to fire full broadsides at a range of only {{convert|4000|m|sp=us}}. They first engaged the British flagship, {{HMS|Hardy|1936|6}}, and badly damaged her. Both of her forward guns were knocked out and the forward superstructure was set afire. ''Hardy'' was forced to [[Beach (nautical)|beach]] herself lest she sink, and the German ships switched their fire to {{HMS|Havock|H43|6}}, the next ship in line. Their fire was relatively ineffective and both sides fired torpedoes without scoring any hits. ''Havock'' pulled out and dropped to the rear to fight off any pursuit by the ships of the 4th Flotilla. This placed {{HMS|Hunter|H35|6}} in the lead and she was quickly set on fire by the German ships. ''Thiele'' probably also hit her with a torpedo and she was rammed from behind by {{HMS|Hotspur|H01|6}} when the latter ship lost steering control. ''Hotspur'' was able to disengage, but ''Hunter'' capsized shortly afterward. The three remaining British ships were able to escape from the Germans under the cover of a smoke screen.<ref>Haarr, pp. 344<U+2013>47</ref> ''Von Arnim'' had been hit by five British shells, which had knocked out one boiler. This was repaired by the morning of 13 April and she received six torpedoes from the badly damaged destroyers.<ref>Whitley, p. 101</ref>
[[File:Bernd von Arnim scuttled.jpg|thumb|Wreck of ''Bernd von Arnim'' in the Rombaksfjorden]]
On the night of 12 April, Commander [[Erich Bey]], the senior surviving German officer, received word to expect an attack the following day by British [[capital ship]]s escorted by a large number of destroyers and supported by carrier aircraft. The battleship {{HMS|Warspite|03|2}} and nine destroyers duly appeared on 13 April, although earlier than Commander Bey had expected, and caught the Germans out of position. The five operable destroyers, including ''Bernd von Arnim'', charged out of Narvik harbor and engaged the British ships. Although no hits were scored, they did inflict splinter damage on several of the destroyers. The ship was able to make a torpedo attack on the British destroyers before being driven off, but her torpedoes all missed. Lack of ammunition forced the German ships to retreat to the [[Rombaksfjorden]] (the easternmost branch of the Ofotfjord), east of Narvik, where they might attempt to ambush pursuing British destroyers. ''Von Arnim'' had exhausted her ammunition and she was beached at the head of the [[fjord]].<ref>Haarr, pp. 356<U+2013>57, 362, 366</ref> Her crew placed demolition charges and abandoned the ship.<ref>Whitley, p. 103</ref> By the time the British reached the ship she had rolled over onto her side. The ship's crew joined the German troops ashore and participated in [[Norwegian Campaign|the campaign]] until the British [[Operation Alphabet|evacuated the area]] in June.<ref>Haarr, pp. 368, 373<U+2013>74</ref>
