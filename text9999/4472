The '''1846 Havana hurricane''' ({{lang-es|'''La Tormenta de San Francisco de Borja'''<!-- Cuban Spanish name -->}}; also known as the '''Great Havana Hurricane of 1846''') was the most intense [[tropical cyclone]] in recorded history for 78&nbsp;years and the first known [[Saffir<U+2013>Simpson hurricane wind scale|Category&nbsp;5-strength hurricane]] to strike [[Cuba]]. The first indications of the formation of a disturbance were first noted on 5&nbsp;October in the [[Caribbean Sea]], but little else was known until the storm approached Cuba on 10&nbsp;October. There, it brought extreme winds and the lowest known [[atmospheric pressure]] of the time <U+2013> 938&nbsp;[[bar (unit)|mbar]] (27.70&nbsp;[[inch of mercury|inHg]]) <U+2013> a record which remained unbroken until the development of [[1924 Cuba hurricane|a later cyclone in 1924]]. It soon curved toward [[Florida]], where it maintained its intensity, continuing to rapidly hasten northward along the [[East Coast of the United States]] to [[New England]]. It entered an [[extratropical cyclone#Extratropical transition|extratropical transition]] while situated over [[New York]] on 13&nbsp;October, producing intense Category&nbsp;2-force winds and unusually little precipitation. Eventually, the gale dissipated over [[the Maritimes|the Canadian Maritimes]] the following day as a markedly weaker storm.

Information on the hurricane's impact in Cuba is sparse due to a lack of existing historical records. The storm caused over a hundred deaths, capsized dozens of ships, obliterated buildings, uprooted trees, and ruined crops. Damage in the [[United States]] was considerably better-chronicled despite being less severe. In [[Key West]], widespread destruction was noted, with 40&nbsp;deaths and many vessels rendered unfit. Structural devastation was also significant, with high floodwaters lifting many buildings off of their foundations and strong gusts flattening hundreds of others. Few supplies arrived in the following days and relief efforts were gradual, with few resources within the town's vicinity. Along other sections of the southeastern coast, copious rainfall and moderate winds impacted agriculture, shipping, and residences. Several boats were rendered unusable, though damage was generally less severe than in Florida and Cuba. As it tracked along the [[Mid-Atlantic states|Middle-Atlantic coast]], similar effects were reported: there, the gale inundated many areas, impeded communications, destroyed railroads and canals, and flattened structures. Despite extensive damage, only two deaths were recorded outside of Cuba and Florida. Along its entire track, the hurricane caused $338,000 in losses and at least 164&nbsp;deaths.{{#tag:ref|All damage figures are in 1846&nbsp;[[United States dollars|United States dollars (USD)]].|group="nb"}}{{#tag:ref|A concrete death total cannot be established due to the hurricane's historical nature; the figure used is one from a modern study,<ref name="DATCs"/> though unofficial sources indicate significantly higher totals.<ref name="Tannehill1938-156"/>|group="nb"}}

Unusual in many aspects, the 1846&nbsp;Havana hurricane was the most intense of its time. Though [[atmospheric pressure]] readings in Cuba reached as low as 916&nbsp;mbar (27.06&nbsp;inHg), the meteorological historian Jose Fernandez-Partag<U+00E1>s re-evaluated several possible pressure records, concluding that the cyclone's minimum pressure was likely closer to 938&nbsp;mbar (27.70&nbsp;inHg); even so, it maintained the title of having the lowest recorded pressure measurement until [[1924 Cuba hurricane|1924]], 78&nbsp;years later. Although no reliable wind measurements were available at the time, a separate study also estimated that it produced Category&nbsp;5-strength winds, making it the first known storm to strike Cuba at such an intensity. As a result of the tropical cyclone's extreme intensity, ecological and geographical features were permanently altered in many areas. [[Sand Key Light|Sand Key]], which completely submerged during the course of the hurricane, wholly re-emerged by December of that year, albeit not in its original position; meanwhile, ecological damage remained evident for decades in Key West.

Advancing northward, the once-powerful hurricane weakened, with somewhat higher atmospheric pressures and winds of less severity reported at [[Charleston, South Carolina]]. Paralleling the coast while situated inland, it hastened quickly toward the north, swiftly passing through [[North Carolina]] and arriving in the [[Chesapeake Bay]] region by 13&nbsp;October.<ref name="Ludlum1963-153"/> Southeasterly gusts persisted as the storm continued its northerly progression inland along the course of the [[East Coast of the United States]]. After reaching [[Washington, D.C.]] in the early morning, it arrived near [[New York City]] by sunrise, and transited across [[Boston]] during the afternoon of 13&nbsp;October. The storm likely underwent an [[extratropical cyclone#Extratropical transition|extratropical transition]] by the time it arrived in [[New York]] state, elongating linearly east-to-west.<ref name="Ludlum1963-94">Ludlum 1963, p. 94</ref> The gale's winds swept toward the southeast with a brief hiatus in the early evening.

== Impact ==
Due to a lack of historical documentation, little is known about the hurricane's impact in [[Cuba]] aside from its severity: the storm destroyed nearly a hundred ships,<ref name="Ludlum1963-151"/> inflicted severe damage to structures throughout [[Havana]],<ref name="Cuba1846-A"/> and likely killed hundreds of individuals there.<ref name="Tannehill1938-156"/> Damage in the [[United States]], however, was better-documented. There, the disturbance washed away the island of [[Sand Key Light|Sand Key]] and resulted in the loss of many vessels in nearby [[Key West]] harbor.<ref name="Ludlum1963-152"/> Its [[storm surge]] scattered debris throughout the city and swept many structures afloat upon high waters.<ref name="Malcolm2010-8"/> In all, approximately $200,000 in damage and 40&nbsp;deaths were reported,<ref name="Ludlum1963-152"/> representing four percent of the town's population.<ref name="Malcolm2010-14"/> Elsewhere in the state, damage remained severe, with abnormal storm tides and widespread property destruction noted.<ref name="Ludlum1963-153"/> Shipping and agriculture took the brunt of the storm's impact in other southeastern states;<ref name="Fraser2009-119"/> there, it produced damage similar to that inflicted by an earlier 1824 hurricane.<ref name="Ludlum1963-153"/> Even farther north along the [[Mid-Atlantic states|Middle-Atlantic coast]], copious rainfall and intense gusts were observed, especially in the [[New England]] region. Winds uprooted trees, cracked canals,<ref name="Ludlum1963-95"/> damaged railroads, and demolished factories.<ref name="Boose2001-HRD"/> Rainfall totals, however, were generally low, indicative of a dry gale.<ref name="Ludlum1963-95"/> In all, the hurricane caused at least 164&nbsp;deaths and $338,000 (1846&nbsp;[[United States dollar|USD]]) in damage throughout its path,{{#tag:ref|Damage totals as follows: [[Fort Zachary Taylor]] endured $200,000 in damage at [[Key West]],<ref name="Malcolm2010-10"/> the $16,000 vessel ''Exchange'' was capsized, the $10,000 boat ''Commissary'' was sunk, the $45,000 ship ''Iris'' was grounded, the $22,000 craft ''Eben Preble'' was beached,<ref name="Singer1998-72">Singer 1998, p. 72</ref> the $5,000 vessel ''La Reunion'' was driven ashore, the $20,000 ship ''Villanueva'' was run aground, and the $20,000 boat ''Navigator'' was beached.<ref name="Singer1998-73">Singer 1998, p. 73</ref>|group="nb"}} although some reports indicated hundreds of additional deaths across the island of Cuba.<ref name="Tannehill1938-156"/>

=== Caribbean Sea ===
Early in its development, the hurricane passed near the [[Cayman Islands]], inundating all of [[Grand Cayman]], with its worth effects concentrated at the localities of Savannah and Newlands, both under a {{convert|15|ft|m|abbr=on}} [[storm surge]].<ref name="Malcolm2010-3"/> Although residential damage was minimal, many grasslands were destroyed.<ref name="Williams1992-73">Williams 1992, p. 73</ref> Damage in [[Cuba]] is mostly unknown; there, the hurricane capsized nearly all crafts docked at [[Havana Harbor]], and of the 104&nbsp;boats in the harbor prior to the storm's arrival, only 12&nbsp;remained after it subsided. Between 40&nbsp;and 50&nbsp;other cargo vessels were impaired, with significant structural damage in the city proper also observed.<ref name="Ludlum1963-151"/> Damage to houses, crops, and shipping was catastrophic throughout the island; the storm was reportedly the worst in Cuban history at the time,<ref name="Schwartz2007-16">Schwartz 2007, p. 16</ref> more severe even than an earlier hurricane in 1844.<ref name="Tannehill1938-156"/> Waves were high enough to reach the lanterns of the [[Morro Castle (fortress)|Morro Castle]] lighthouse. While no concrete death toll was established, reports indicated the deaths of several dozen individuals during the entire course of the storm,<ref name="Malcolm2010-3">Malcolm 2010, p. 3</ref> while other records noted that hundreds of deaths had possibly occurred across the island.<ref name="Tannehill1938-156"/>

Spanish publications contained more detail, describing the hurricane's extensive damage on the island. In Havana, the hurricane damaged churches and four convents, and impaired roofs, walls, and windows at the [[University of Havana]]. The local [[Real Audiencia]] also suffered the loss of doors and walls, and the nearby governor house's main gate, walls, and [[Aztec]] lighting appliances were ruined. Post offices and the main theater also endured the storm's impacts, and at two military barracks, the storm wrecked walls and windows, and in one, a [[sump]] spilled over, tainting the city's supply of clean water. Another military instillation, the [[Castillo de San Pedro de la Roca]], experienced similar effects, with cracked walls and windows; nevertheless, ship traffic monitoring there continued. Hospitals suffered significant damage, with one's wall and infirmary torn off; in addition, piles of [[guano]], the local church, school, and hospital were destroyed by the hurricane at [[G<U+00FC>ines]]. In all, the hurricane caused some degree of damage to 2792&nbsp;residences in Havana, with approximately 4000&nbsp;houses damaged in both the city and its outskirts combined. Sugar, tobacco, and other goods were wrecked as a result of damage to shipping in the city. The cyclone uprooted about 1258&nbsp;trees in Havana and left 2314&nbsp;individuals homeless. Overall, the hurricane's swath of damage encompassed an area about {{convert|70|to|80|mi|km|abbr=on}} wide. The storm later produced high winds in [[the Bahamas]] without any reported damage.<ref name="Cuba1846-A">{{es icon}} {{cite book|title=Huracan de 1846: Rese<U+00F1>a de sus Estragos en la Isla de Cuba|year=1846|publisher=Oficina del Faro Industrial|location=Havana, Cuba}}</ref>

[[File:1846 hurricane Key West, Florida map.png|thumb|right|300px|Map depicting the extent of the hurricane's damage in Key West.|alt=A sketch detailing damage caused by the 1846 hurricane.]]
The impacts of the hurricane were extreme throughout the state of [[Florida]], especially in the [[Florida Keys]]. High winds washed away two lighthouses near [[Key West]], resulting in the deaths of all 16&nbsp;people at [[Sand Key Light]] and 14&nbsp;individuals at the [[Key West lighthouse]];<ref name="Ludlum1963-152"/> although keeper [[Barbara Mabrity]] survived, seven of her children died while taking refuge there during the hurricane.<ref name="DeWire1995-124">De Wire 1995, p. 124</ref> The {{convert|5|ft|m|abbr=on}}-[[storm surge]] in Key West proper swept through downtown and forced many to abandon their homes; many attempted to flee to higher ground but were still killed or injured. All wharves and warehouses in the town suffered some degree of damage, and of the approximately six hundred residences on the key, only six endured the storm's fury successfully, with the others unroofed or flattened by intense winds. [[Fort Zachary Taylor]], partially obliterated by the hurricane, endured over $200,000 in damage, while the nearby customs-house was also harmed. Uprooted trees and debris from destroyed houses rendered roads impassable. The storm also changed the landscape within the vicinity, washing away Sand Key entirety.<ref name="Ludlum1963-152"/> However, the island quickly resurfaced by that December, albeit {{convert|50|ft|m|abbr=on}} west of its original position.<ref name="Malcolm2010-10">Malcolm 2010, p. 10</ref> Every vessel at local harbor sustained serious damage; in addition, some 20&nbsp;vessels were unaccounted for, and at least 40&nbsp;deaths were documented,<ref name="Ludlum1963-152"/> though another source suggested 50&nbsp;lives were lost out at sea.<ref name="Barnes2007-60">Barnes 2007, p. 60</ref> An additional twelve died inland as a result death by being impaled, crushed, or drowned.<ref name="Malcolm2010-9">Malcolm 2010, p. 9</ref>

Powerful winds and the storm's massive flood tide washed lumber and casks aboard ships. Massive pieces of timber, hurled across town, cracked walls and inflicted significant damage. Floodwaters {{convert|3|ft|m|abbr=on}} deep submerged already debris-clogged streets, with inundation as deep as {{convert|7.5|ft|m|abbr=on}} in the key's northeastern sector. There, the Lafayette Salt Company was swept away along with two military cemeteries. Floodwaters exhumed many skeletons and coffins in those graveyards, dispersing them across local forests.<ref name="Barnes2007-60"/> In downtown, both the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] and [[Methodism|Methodist]] chapels collapsed, and warehouses were moderately damaged.<ref name="Malcolm2010-9"/> The town's new stone marine hospital, struck by the remnants of a wharf and a large raft, was nearly completely destroyed by the storm's intense winds. Lumber, crowbars, and cannon carriages from the construction site of Fort Zachary Taylor were scattered throughout the streets. High waters floated a camp stable {{convert|200|ft|m|abbr=on}} from its initial location, floating its horses and mules to safety. Four drowning deaths were chronicled at the fort, all having been swept away from the fort.<ref name="Malcolm2010-8">Malcolm 2010, p. 8</ref> Several wooden buildings along the shoreline, not tethered to the ground, drifted out to sea upon high waters due to the sheer force of the hurricane's gusts.<ref name="Malcolm2010-14">Malcolm 2010, p. 14</ref> Other notable maritime losses were also noted nearby, with the deaths of three on the ''Lafayette'', which capsized offshore, one fatality each upon the ''Exchange'' and ''Frankford'', and 19&nbsp;casualties on the ''Villa Nueva''; in addition, several other abandoned vessels were driven aground, apparently without any loss of life.<ref name="Malcolm2010-9"/>

The storm's path of devastation extended northward through the state. In [[Manatee County, Florida|Manatee County]], a plantation owner and his horse drowned attempting to cross the elevated waters of the [[Little Manatee River]].<ref name="Barnes2007-60"/> To the north at [[Fort Brooke]], high winds felled several oak trees on the grounds of a local military installation,<ref name="Ludlum1963-152"/> wholly uprooting several others. In nearby [[Tampa Bay]] proper, winds obliterated several houses and flattened fences.<ref name="Ludlum1963-153"/> To the northeast at [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]], the storm was more severe, with the hurricane's winds having been "beyond anything in the recollection of&nbsp;... the oldest inhabitant [of the town]." Storm tides exceeded the previously recorded [[high water mark]] by {{convert|6|ft|m|abbr=on}}, inundating numerous wharves and businesses along the path of Bay Street. By the time the storm's fury abated, the storm tossed wharves out to sea, wrecked structures along the [[St. Johns River]], and rendered nearby saw mills' lumber worthless.<ref name="Ludlum1963-153"/>

Even along other, farther north, portions of the southeastern coast, the gale remained intense. At [[Savannah, Georgia]], one fatality occurred at sea, and damage to fences, roofs, and trees was minor despite high winds,<ref name="Ludlum1963-153"/> with debris from the remnants of [[melia azedarach|chinaberry trees]] littering the streets of the city. A schooner capsized at Union Wharf, and farther down the coast at [[Tybee Island, Georgia|Tybee Island]], another craft was washed aground. Within the vicinity of [[Darien, Georgia]], the gale's high tides swamped rice fields, also impeding the impending harvest along the [[Savannah River]] in [[South Carolina]].<ref name="Fraser2009-119">Fraser 2009, p. 119</ref> Although little rain fell farther north at [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], with merely {{convert|2.03|in|cm|abbr=on}} measured, gusts leveled wharves, uprooted trees, prostrated fences, and unroofed buildings. Despite copious rainfall measurements at [[Columbia, South Carolina|Columbia]], which received {{convert|4.50|in|cm|abbr=on}} of rainfall, damage was minimal and, for the most part, restricted to crops.<ref name="Ludlum1963-153"/> The vessel ''Mutual Safety'' departed Charleston in the mid-afternoon of 10&nbsp;October,<ref name="Fraser2009-118">Fraser 2009, p. 118</ref> but soon encountered the storm and experienced severe damage. In an effort to save the vessel's passengers, it was deliberately run ashore near Jacksonville, Florida, without the loss of any passengers on board; however, the steamer itself was not salvageable. A dozen ships beached or capsized in Charleston's harbors, with many wharves demolished along the city's shoreline. The western part of Tradd Street, especially near Chisolm's Mill and South Bay's sidewalk, eroded as a result of wind and water, which also fractured the South Bay and East Battery walls. Gusts unroofed the Trinity Church along Hasell Street; the roof itself landed in an adjacent graveyard.<ref name="Fraser2009-119"/> Despite extensive damage, only one death was noted in the city, that of a slave whose boat floundered at sea.<ref name="Fraser2009-120">Fraser 2009, p. 120</ref> Unexpectedly low storm tides of {{convert|2|ft|in|abbr=on}} at [[Georgetown, South Carolina]] and [[Wilmington, North Carolina]] inflicted no noteworthy damage. In general, however, the hurricane was reportedly the most severe since [[1824 Atlantic hurricane season|1824]] along the southeastern seaboard.<ref name="Ludlum1963-153"/>

=== Mid-Atlantic and Northeast ===
Not a single wharf at [[Baltimore|Baltimore, Maryland]] escaped the hurricane's [[storm surge]], which inundated the length of [[Pratt Street]] along the shore; meanwhile, the [[Potomac River]] at [[Washington, D.C.]] and [[Alexandria, Virginia]], attained its highest level in 20&nbsp;years,<ref name="Ludlum1963-94">Ludlum 1963, p. 94</ref> with the latter two cities plagued by [[surface runoff]] on 13&nbsp;October, following the storm's passage. The [[Chesapeake and Ohio Canal]] also bore the brunt of the storm's impact, having been swamped by potent rainfall as well.<ref name="Schwartz2007-61">Schwartz 2007, p. 61</ref> Low-lying areas along the [[Delaware River]], including [[New Castle, Delaware]], experienced storm tides not seen since the [[1775 Newfoundland hurricane]]. The floodwaters were high enough to even extinguish a fire in a stationary [[locomotive]] which had been impeded by the gale's rainfall. The local [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]]'s steeple was tossed away by forceful gusts. To the north at [[Philadelphia]], the tempest was the most intense in 30&nbsp;years, with its high tides engulfing every wharf in the city; a total of {{convert|1.25|in|cm|abbr=on}} of rain was measured at [[Pennsylvania Hospital]]. Despite widespread destruction along the Delaware River, damage to buildings in Philadelphia proper was less severe.<ref name="Ludlum1963-94"/> Heavy rainfall was also generated throughout western portions of the state.<ref name="Ludlum1963-95">Ludlum 1963, p. 95</ref> In neighboring [[New Jersey]], considerable damage to structures, timber, land, and livestock was observed, with winds toppling several buildings and trees; widespread rainfall, meanwhile, flooded salt marshes, also drowning cattle and sheep.<ref name="Ludlum1963-94"/> High winds tangled poles and wires, in turn interrupting [[Telegraphy|telegraphic communications]] along the Washington-Baltimore-New York corridor.<ref name="Schwartz2007-61"/>

Damage was similarly severe in [[New England]], despite its [[extratropical cyclone#Extratropical transition|transition into a weaker extratropical cyclone]]. Despite being significantly farther east from [[New York City]], significant damage was observed, with the waters of [[Upper New York Bay]] crashing over the [[Battery Park]] sea wall, washing away {{convert|300|ft|m|abbr=on}} of its length.<ref name="Ludlum1963-95"/> Gusts caved in chimneys, uprooted trees, and sank several canal boats at the city's wharves.<ref name="Boose2001-HRD">{{cite web|title=Historical Report Database|url=http://harvardforest.fas.harvard.edu/data/p01/hf011/hf011-05-reports.html|work=[[Harvard University]]|publisher=[[Harvard Forest]]|accessdate=1 January 2014}}</ref> At [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], a rupture along the [[Erie Canal]] interrupted nearby traffic, and to the east in [[Dansville, Steuben County, New York|Dansville]], copious rainfall was also recorded. Approximately {{convert|1.25|in|cm|abbr=on}} of rain accompanied low [[atmospheric pressure]] readings throughout a wide area, with winds along the gale's eastern fringes, especially at [[Cape Cod|Cape Cod, Massachusetts]], remaining intense. In New England, it was generally considered to be the most severe storm since a previous disturbance in October&nbsp;1841, despite having produced minimal rainfall totals throughout the region, including {{convert|0.33|in|cm|abbr=on}} at [[New Bedford, Massachusetts|New Bedford]]. Gusts felled trees paralleling both sides of a roadway from [[Springfield, Massachusetts|Springfield]] to [[Amherst, Massachusetts|Amherst]]. Nearby at [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]], winds flattened several factories, and also overturned a substantial number trees in the outskirts of [[Boston]].<ref name="Ludlum1963-95"/> A newly-built brick residence's walls in the southern end of the city collapsed; on the other side of the city, a sawing and planing mill was razed to the ground.<ref name="Boose2001-HRD"/>

Within the proximity of Boston at the towns of [[Canton, Massachusetts|Canton]] and [[Southborough, Massachusetts|Southborough]], winds obliterated two factories. High winds at [[Grafton, Massachusetts|Grafton]] collapsed the railroad sheds under the ownership of the [[Providence and Worcester Railroad]]. [[Malden, Massachusetts|Malden]] endured the loss of a mansion which was still under construction, and several smaller buildings were also blown down there and at [[Monson, Massachusetts|Monson]]. Winds upturned trees and toppled fences at [[Northampton, Massachusetts|Northampton]], and nearby at [[Palmer, Massachusetts|Palmer]], a school building was crumbled into pieces by intense winds. At Springfield, winds unroofed a repair facility at a local railroad depot and a house at the [[Springfield Armory|town armory]]. Gusts destroyed railroad sheds and factories in [[Stoughton, Massachusetts|Stoughton]] and Worcester as well, and at [[Wilmington, Massachusetts|Wilmington]], winds crumbled a house into pieces.<ref name="Boose2001-HRD"/> Slightly to the south in [[Norwich, Connecticut]], fallen trees obstructed railroad tracks, and at [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]], a railroad bridge was thrown farther upstream along the [[Connecticut River]].<ref name="Ludlum1963-95"/> Further railroad damage was noted to property owned by the [[Winchester and Potomac Railroad|Winchester and Potomac]], [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad|Baltimore and Ohio]], and other railroads throughout the region.

[[File:Sand Key, Florida map pre-1846.png|thumb|right|190px|Map of Sand Key, Florida prior to the 1846 hurricane|alt=A sketch of an island's shape and its dimensions]]
Officials in Cuba raised 8094&nbsp;[[Cuban peso|pesos]] in the days following the hurricane's passage.<ref name="Cuba1846-A"/> Immediately following the storm's end, the [[Quartermaster Corps (United States Army)|U.S. Army Quartermaster]] permitted homeless citizens to rest in its local barracks. Food, water, and supplies were lacking, with most having been washed away, rendered unusable, or become inedible due to the storm's salty [[storm surge]]. The ''Morris'''s captain obtained supplies from a damaged vessel, sending them to a local Methodist minister. Efforts to reconstruct and recover from the disaster were not immediate due to the lack of available resources. With the loss of area lighthouses, local waters were difficult to navigate, with one shipwreck occurring as a result west of Key West; in response, a {{convert|60|ft|m|abbr=on}} staff was placed at the former location of the now-destroyed [[Key West lighthouse]]. Many vessels were also lost near Sand Key Light,<ref name="Malcolm2010-10"/> and decades later, the tower, poorly maintained due to a lack of government funding, continued to deteriorate.<ref name="Malcolm2010-11"/> The 1846 hurricane resulted in a variety of both geological, geographical, and ecological alterations. In [[Key West]], the local salt pond shifted from its original position, becoming a hindrance to local residents and requiring it to be filled up; eventually, the tourist district of Key West emerged over the former site of the salt pond. By December&nbsp;1846, [[Sand Key Light|Sand Key]], which was inundated during the hurricane, resurfaced from the waters of the Atlantic. However, it was situated approximately {{convert|50|ft|m|abbr=on}} west of its location prior to the hurricane, and even months later, the lighthouse remained under {{convert|2|ft|m|abbr=on}} of seawater.<ref name="Malcolm2010-10"/> Years afterward, greenery on the key was sparse, and little native vegetation existed. Signs of ecological damage remained even in the early 1880s, evidenced by the presence of [[Juncaceae|rush]]es among the leaves of trees and bushes.<ref name="Malcolm2010-11">Malcolm 2010, p. 11</ref>

The 1846&nbsp;Havana hurricane was likely of Category&nbsp;5 intensity, the earliest known [[tropical cyclone]] of its strength to strike [[Cuba]].<!-- 1844 was probably a C4. In addition, this can be verified with indirect reasoning, given previous Cuban hurricanes --><ref name="Landsea2012-883"/> In 1993, the weather historian Jose Fernandez-Partag<U+00E1>s analyzed an anomalous [[atmospheric pressure]] of 916&nbsp;[[bar (unit)|mbar]] (27.06&nbsp;[[inch of mercury|inHg]]) measured at [[Havana|Havana, Cuba]] upon the vessel ''Thames'', deeming it to be abnormally low and evaluating its true value to be closer to 938&nbsp;mbar (27.70&nbsp;inHg), making the hurricane the most intense in recorded history at the time.<ref name="Partag<U+00E1>s1993-1"/> The exceptionally low pressure reading in Cuba surpassed a previous record of 948&nbsp;mbar (28.00&nbsp;inHg) set by an 1844&nbsp;storm, with the new record eventually exceeded by the [[1924 Cuba hurricane]], which featured a manually recorded pressure reading of 932&nbsp;mbar (27.52&nbsp;inHg).<ref name="Partag<U+00E1>s1993-4">Partag<U+00E1>s 1993, p. 4</ref>{{#tag:ref|Although the [[1910 Cuba hurricane]] also exceeded the record and the [[1924 Cuba hurricane]] each had lower pressures in the [[HURDAT]] database, those pressure measurements were estimated. For the purposes of this article, all pressure records are not estimated.|group="nb"}}
