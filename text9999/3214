The government and people of [[Niger]] observe thirteen official public holidays.  These include international commemorations, the commemoration of important dates in the [[history of Niger]], and religious holidays.  Both [[Christian]] and [[Muslim]] holidays are observed as official public holidays.  While the former colonial power, [[France]], instituted Christian observances, the vast majority of [[Islam in Niger|Nigeriens are Muslim]].

Because [[Muslim holidays|Muslim holiday]] are dependent on the [[Islamic calendar]], and  -- like Christian [[Easter]] -- move from year to year.  Some Muslim holidays are also dependent upon astronomical sightings (e.g.: the observance of [[moonrise]] for [[Ramadan]].  National commemorations and secular international holidays are fixed on the [[Gregorian calendar]], the standard civil calendar used in Niger as most of the world. 

==Official holidays==
Below are the 13 official public holidays recognized by the [[Government of Niger]].  Businesses, schools, and public services are closed on these days.  They are often dates of public festivals, political speeches, and large gatherings.
