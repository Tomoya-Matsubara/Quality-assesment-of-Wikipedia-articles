'''''The Chimes: A Goblin Story of Some Bells that Rang an Old Year Out and a New Year In''''', a short novel by [[Charles Dickens]], was written and published in 1844, one year after ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'' and one year before ''[[The Cricket on the Hearth]]''. It is the second in his series of "Christmas books": five short books with strong social and moral messages that he published during the 1840s.

==Development history==
The book was written in late 1844, during Dickens' year-long visit to [[Italy]].<ref name="House">{{cite book|last=House|first=Madeline|coauthors=Tillotston, Kathleen; Storey, Graham|title=The Letters of Charles Dickens|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=2002|chapter=Preface, p.x|isbn=0198124759, 9780198124757|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=8Xxn8x-JYLMC&pg=PR9&lpg=PR11&vq=Chimes&dq=The+Chimes+Dickens&lr=&ie=ISO-8859-1&output=html}}</ref>  [[John Forster (biographer)|John Forster]], his first biographer, records that Dickens, hunting for a title and structure for his next contracted Christmas story, was struck one day by the clamour of the Genoese bells audible from the villa where they were staying.

{{quote|All Genoa lay beneath him, and up from it, with some sudden set of the wind, came in one fell sound the clang and clash of all its steeples, pouring into his ears, again and again, in a tuneless, grating, discordant, jerking, hideous vibration that made his ideas "spin round and round till they lost themselves in a whirl of vexation and giddiness, and dropped down dead."<ref name="Forster">{{cite book|last=Forster|first=John|title=The Life of Charles Dickens|volume=vol 4|chapter=Chapter V|url=http://www.lang.nagoya-u.ac.jp/~matsuoka/CD-Forster-4.html#IV}}</ref>
}}
Two days later Forster received a letter from Dickens which read simply: ""We have heard THE CHIMES at midnight, Master Shallow!",<ref name="Forster" /> and the writing of the book began.  Forster describes Dickens' intentions in writing ''The Chimes'' as striking "a blow for the poor".   {{quote|They had always been his clients, they had never been forgotten in any of his books, but here nothing else was to be remembered ... he had come to have as little faith for the putting down of any serious evil, as in a then notorious city alderman's gabble for the putting down of suicide. The latter had stirred his indignation to its depths just before he came to Italy, and his increased opportunities of solitary reflection since had strengthened and extended it. When he came therefore to think of his new story for Christmas time, he resolved to make it a plea for the poor ... He was to try and convert Society, as he had converted [[Ebenezer Scrooge|Scrooge]], by showing that its happiness rested on the same foundations as those of the individual, which are mercy and charity not less than justice.<ref name="Forster" />}}

Dickens returned to London for a week in December 1844 and gave readings of the finished book to friends prior to publication, in order to judge its impact; the artist [[Daniel Maclise]], who had contributed two illustrations to ''The Chimes'' and attended two of these events, portrayed the reading of 3rd December 1844 in a well-known sketch<ref name="Cohen">{{cite book|last=Cohen|first=Jane A|title=Charles Dickens and his Original Illustrators|publisher=Ohio State University Press|date=1980|pages=168|chapter=10|url=http://www.ohiostatepress.org/books/Complete%20PDFs/Cohen%20Charles/13.pdf}}</ref>.

==Explanation of the novel's title==
The chimes are old bells in the [[Church (building)|church]] on whose steps Trotty Veck plies his trade. The book is divided into four parts named "quarters", after the quarter chimes of a [[striking clock]]. (This parallels Dickens naming the parts of ''A Christmas Carol'' "staves" <U+2013> that is "stanzas" <U+2013> and dividing ''The Cricket on the Hearth'' into "chirps".)

==Plot summary==
One New Year's Eve Trotty, a "ticket-porter" or casual messenger, is filled with gloom at the reports of crime and immorality in the newspapers, and wonders whether the working classes are simply wicked by nature. His daughter Meg and her long-time fianc<U+00E9> Richard arrive and announce their decision to marry next day. Trotty hides his misgivings, but their happiness is dispelled by an encounter with a pompous [[alderman]], Cute, plus a [[Political economy|political economist]] and a young gentleman with a nostalgia for the past, all of whom make Trotty, Meg and Richard feel they hardly have a right to exist, let alone marry.

Trotty carries a note for Cute to Sir Joseph Bowley [[Member of Parliament|MP]], who dispenses charity to the poor in the manner of a paternal [[dictator]]. Bowley is ostentatiously settling his debts to ensure a clean start to the new year, and berates Trotty because he owes a few [[shilling]]s to his local shop which he cannot pay off. Returning home, convinced that he and his fellow poor are naturally ungrateful and have no place in society, Trotty encounters Will Fern, a poor countryman, and his orphaned niece, Lilian. Fern has been unfairly accused of [[vagrancy (people)|vagrancy]] and wants to visit Cute to set matters straight, but from a conversation overheard at Bowley's house, Trotty is able to warn him that Cute plans to have him arrested and imprisoned. He takes the pair home with him and he and Meg share their meagre food and poor lodging with the visitors. Meg tries to hide her distress, but it seems she has been dissuaded from marrying Richard by her encounter with Cute and the others.

In the night the bells seem to call Trotty. Going to the church he finds the tower door unlocked and climbs to the bellchamber, where he discovers the spirits of the bells and their [[goblin]] attendants who reprimand him for losing faith in man's destiny to improve and progress. He is told that he fell from the tower during his climb and is now dead, and Meg's subsequent life must now be an object lesson for him. There follows a series of visions which he is forced to watch, helpless to interfere with the troubled lives of Meg, Richard, Will and Lilian over the subsequent years. Richard descends into [[alcoholism]]; Meg eventually marries him in an effort to save him but he dies ruined, leaving her with a baby. Will is driven in and out of prison by petty laws and restrictions; Lilian turns to [[prostitution]]. In the end, destitute, Meg is driven to contemplate drowning herself and her child, thus committing the mortal [[sin]]s of murder and suicide. The Chimes' intention is to teach Trotty that, far from being naturally wicked, mankind is formed to strive for nobler things, and will fall only when crushed and repressed beyond bearing. Trotty breaks down when he sees Meg poised to jump into the river, cries that he has learned his lesson, and begs the Chimes to save her, whereupon he finds himself able to touch her and prevent her from jumping.

With this the vision ends and Trotty finds himself awakening at home as if from a dream as the bells ring in the New Year, and the book ends with celebrations for Meg and Richard's wedding day.

==Main characters==
* Toby "Trotty" Veck, a messenger or "ticket-porter", and the main protagonist
* Margaret "Meg" Veck, Toby's 20-year old daughter
* Mrs. Anne Chickenstalker, the local shopkeeper
* Alderman Cute, a Justice of the Peace
* Mr. Filer, a political economist in the [[Utilitarian]] mould
* Sir Joseph Bowley, a rich paternalist MP
* Will Fern, a countryman
* Lilian Fern, Will's orphaned niece

==Major themes==
This is a campaigning story like its predecessor ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'', written with the intention of swaying readers towards Dickens' moral message. The chimes represent time, and the main themes of the story are summarized in the three wrongs they accuse Trotty of committing:

<U+2022> Harking back to a golden age that never was, instead of striving to improve conditions here and now.

<U+2022> Believing that individual human joys and sorrows do not matter to a higher power.

<U+2022> Condemning those who are fallen and unfortunate, and offering them neither help nor pity.

<blockquote>'Who turns his back upon the fallen and disfigured of his kind; abandons them as vile; and does not trace and track with pitying eyes the unfenced precipice by which they fell from good<U+2014>grasping in their fall some tufts and shreds of that lost soil, and clinging to them still when bruised and dying in the gulf below; does wrong to Heaven and man, to time and to eternity. And you have done that wrong!'</blockquote>

==Literary significance and reception==
''A Christmas Carol'' had been extremely well received the previous year, and ''The Chimes'' aroused public interest and anticipation. Five different stage productions of the book were running within weeks of publication and nearly 20,000 copies were sold in the first three months. It had a high media profile, and was widely reviewed and discussed. Critical opinion was divided; those sympathetic to its social and political message liked the book, but others thought it dangerously radical. The ''Northern Star'' reviewer called Dickens "the champion of the poor"; ''[[John Bull]]'' rejected his unflattering caricatures of philanthropy<ref name=slater>{{cite book | last=Slater | first=Michael | authorlink=Michael Slater | title= Introduction to The Chimes in Charles Dickens: The Christmas Books, Volume 1. | location=London | publisher=Penguin Classics | date=1985 | page=139<U+2013>140}}</ref>. It was certainly a financial success for Dickens, and remained popular for many years, although in the long term its fame was eclipsed by that of ''A Christmas Carol''.

==Allusions and references==
===Allusions to other works===	
Asking the upper classes to stop interfering with his life and leave him to die, Will Fern makes a bitter reference to the biblical ''[[Book of Ruth]]'', misquoting Ruth's "Whither thou goest, I will go" speech.

===Allusions to actual history, geography and current science===
The novel's setting is contemporary and the 1840s, the "Hungry Forties", were a time of social and political unrest.

Trotty's conviction that poor people are naturally wicked is influenced by an article in his newspaper about a young woman who has tried to drown herself and her child, and this motif returns at the climax of the book, when Meg is driven to contemplate the same course of action. This is a reference to Mary Furley, a destitute young woman sentenced to death in 1844 for [[infanticide]] after her desperation not to return to the [[workhouse]] led to a failed suicide attempt in which her illegitimate child drowned.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.victorianweb.org/books/suicide/03.html|title=Gates, Barbara T. ''Mad Crimes and Sad Histories'' Chapter 3 at VictorianWeb|accessdate=2008-02-13}}</ref> This case caused great public debate in the late spring of 1844.  Dickens took part in the general outcry against the sentence, which was eventually commuted to [[penal transportation|transportation]].<ref>Slater, 264</ref> Among other works inspired by the Furley case is [[Thomas Hood]]'s poem ''[[The Bridge of Sighs (poem)|The Bridge of Sighs]]''.

Alderman Cute is a parody of Sir Peter Laurie, a Middlesex magistrate, alderman and former Lord Mayor of London, known for his determination to "put down" the lower classes and their antisocial behaviour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gresham.ac.uk/event.asp?PageId=4&EventId=549|title=Dickens' Law Makers and Law Breakers: Barnard's Inn and Beyond|last=Sanders|first=Prof. Andrew|date=7.11.2006|work=Lecture transcript|publisher=Gresham College website|accessdate=6 December 2009}}</ref>  His remarks on the 1844 Mary Furley case have been cited as one inspiration to Dickens to write ''The Chimes''.

The unnamed young man who harks back to the "good old times" is a reference to the [[Young England]] movement. Dickens removed many of these references prior to publication.

==Adaptation==
A musical adaptation of ''The Chimes'' was created in 1992 by Lisa Kofod and Gay Donat Reed, with music by Paul Johnson. A staged reading of this work was produced at The Workhouse Theatre in New York City.

''The Chimes'' was adapted into a 24-minute [[clay animation|clay-animated]] film in 2000 by [[Xyzoo Animation]]. It won a Cine Special Jury award in 2002.

In 2004 a stage adaptation by Les Smith premiered at the [[Southwark Playhouse]].
