'''John Dwight Chesbro''' (June 5, 1874&nbsp;<U+2013> November 6, 1931) was a [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) [[pitcher]]. Nicknamed "Happy Jack", Chesbro played for the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] (1899<U+2013>1902), the [[New York Yankees|New York Highlanders]] (1903<U+2013>1909), and the [[Boston Red Sox]] (1909). Chesbro finished his career with a [[Win<U+2013>loss record (pitching)|win-loss record]] of 198-132, an [[earned run average]] of 2.68, and 1,265 [[strikeout]]s. His 41 wins during the 1904 season remains an MLB record for the modern era, and is viewed as unbreakable.<ref name=record>{{cite news|url=http://enidnews.com/sportslocal/x518673469/Slugger-Bonds-record-to-be-will-be-broken-in-time?keyword=topstory|date=July 30, 2007|title=Slugger Bonds<U+2019> record-to-be will be broken in time|first=Bruce|last=Campbell|newspaper=[[Enid News & Eagle]]|accessdate=December 14, 2011}}</ref>

Chesbro was elected to the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|National Baseball Hall of Fame]] in 1946 by the [[Veterans Committee]], though he had received little consideration from the [[Baseball Writers Association of America]] (BBWAA). Some baseball historians consider the 1946 election a mistake, and believe that Chesbro was elected solely on the basis of his 1904 season.

==Early life==
He was born John Dwight Chesebrough on June 5, 1874 in Haughtonville, a village in [[North Adams, Massachusetts]].<ref name=ghost48>Fleitz, p. 48</ref> He was the fourth of five children of Chad Brown Chesebrough, a shoemaker, and Martha Jane Fralensburgh.<ref name=sabr>{{cite web|url=http://bioproj.sabr.org/bioproj.cfm?a=v&v=l&bid=3177&pid=2381|title=Jack Chesbro|first=Wayne|last=McElreavy|publisher=[[Society for American Baseball Research]]|accessdate=November 25, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&db=lanastl&id=I13911|title=John Dwight Chesebrough|accessdate=December 10, 2011}}</ref>

==Professional career==
===Minor leagues (1895<U+2013>1899)===
Chesbro began his professional career in [[minor league baseball]] in 1895. That year, he pitched for the [[Albany Senators (minor league baseball)|Albany Senators]] of the [[New York State League (1885<U+2013>1917)|New York State League]] until they folded, at which point he joined the [[Johnstown, New York|Johnstown]] Buckskins. When the league disbanded during the season, he joined the [[Springfield, Massachusetts|Springfield]] Maroons of the [[International League|Eastern League]].<ref name=sabr/> In 1896, Chesbro pitched for the [[Roanoke, Virginia|Roanoke]] Magicians of the [[Virginia League (1894-1896)|Virginia League]], until it disbanded. He pitched the remainder of the 1896 season in [[Cooperstown, New York]] for the Cooperstown Athletics. There, the local newspaper shortened his last name to "Chesbro" so that it would fit in the box score.<ref>Fleitz, p. 50</ref>

Chesbro pitched for the [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] Bluebirds of the [[Atlantic League (1896<U+2013>1900)|Atlantic League]] from 1897 through 1899. After the 1898 season, he was drafted by [[Ned Hanlon (baseball)|Ned Hanlon]] of the [[Baltimore Orioles (19th century)|Baltimore Orioles]]. However, Hanlon took a job with the [[Los Angeles Dodgers|Brooklyn Superbas]] and the Orioles were nearly contracted, resulting in Chesbro not signing with Baltimore, as Hanlon allowed the option to lapse.<ref name=sabr/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=-KNLAAAAIBAJ&sjid=ZjADAAAAIBAJ&pg=1314,4667378|title=One To Naught In Windy City: Orphans Succeed in Shutting Out St. Louis Nine|newspaper=[[The Deseret News|Deseret Evening News]]|page=5|date=August 4, 1899|accessdate=November 25, 2011}}</ref> He returned to Richmond for the 1899 season.

===Major League Baseball (1899<U+2013>1909)===
Chesbro was sold by Richmond to the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] on July 7, 1899 for $1,500 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1500|1899}}}} in current dollar terms). He made his [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) debut with the Pirates on July 12, 1899. He recorded a 6<U+2013>9 [[win-loss record (pitching)|win-loss record]] for the [[1899 Pittsburgh Pirates season|1899 Pirates]]. After the season, on December 8, 1899, Chesbro was traded with [[George Fox (baseball)|George Fox]], [[Art Madison]], [[John O'Brien (second baseman)|John O'Brien]], and $25,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|25000|1899}}}} in current dollar terms) to the [[Louisville Colonels]] for [[Honus Wagner]], [[Fred Clarke]], [[Bert Cunningham]], [[Mike Kelley (baseball)|Mike Kelley]], [[Tacks Latimer]], [[Tommy Leach]], [[Tom Messitt]], [[Deacon Phillippe]], [[Claude Ritchey]], [[Rube Waddell]], [[Jack Wadsworth]], and [[Chief Zimmer]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/PIT/1899-transactions.shtml|title=1899 Pittsburgh Pirates Trades and Transactions|work=[[Baseball-Reference.com]]|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|accessdate=December 20, 2011}}</ref> The Louisville club dissolved that offseason, and Chesbro, Fox, Madison and O'Brien were assigned to Pittsburgh in March as the [[National League]] (NL) reduced from 12 to eight teams.<ref name=sabr/>

At the end of the 1902 season, the upstart [[American League]] (AL) began to entice NL stars to join their league by offering competitive salaries. Chesbro agreed to sign with a new AL franchise, the [[New York Yankees|New York Highlanders]] (presently known as the New York Yankees), for the 1903 season, for a $1,000 bonus (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1000|1902}}}} in current dollar terms) to join the AL.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=F10F12F63A591B728DDDAE0894D1405B828CF1D3|title=American League Here; Another Baseball Team Proposed for New York Next Season|newspaper=The New York Times|format=PDF|date=September 7, 1902|accessdate=November 25, 2011}}</ref> The news broke when [[Jesse Tannehill]], who also agreed to join the Highlanders, told [[List of Pittsburgh Pirates owners and executives|Pirates owner]] [[Barney Dreyfuss]] about the planned defection while under the influence of pain medication.<ref name=ghost52>Fleitz, p. 52</ref>  When he refused to participate in a postseason series, Dreyfuss released Chesbro from the Pirates.<ref name=ghost52/>

That year, the Veterans Committee elected eleven players: Chesbro, [[Jesse Burkett]], [[Frank Chance]], [[Johnny Evers]], [[Clark Griffith]], [[Tommy McCarthy]], [[Joe McGinnity]], [[Eddie Plank]], [[Joe Tinker]], [[Rube Waddell]], and [[Ed Walsh]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/415067571.html?dids=415067571:415067571&FMT=CITE&FMTS=CITE:AI&type=historic&date=Apr+24%2C+1946&author=&pub=Los+Angeles+Times&desc=Eleven+Gain+Hall+of+Fame&pqatl=google|title=Eleven Gain Hall of Fame|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|page=A6|date=April 24, 1946|accessdate=November 25, 2011}} {{subscription required|date=November 2011}}</ref> During years where Chesbro was eligible on the BBWAA ballot, Chesbro received zero votes in the [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1936|1936 balloting]], one vote in the [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1937|1937 balloting]], two votes in the [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1938|1938 balloting]], and six votes in the [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1939|1939 balloting]], zero votes in the [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1942|1942 balloting]], and zero votes in the [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1945|1945 balloting]].<ref>Fleitz, p. 47</ref>

Chesbro's 1904 record for games won in a season (41 wins) has stood for over a century, one of the oldest major records in baseball, or in any other sport. Under current playing practices, his record is unbreakable.<ref name=record/><ref name=ghost48/> Chesbro started 51 games that season (plus 4 relief appearances) and pitched 48 complete games, for a record of 41<U+2013>12. Today, it is uncommon for a pitcher to start even 35 games in a season and complete games are a rarity. The only other 40-win season since 1900 was 40 by Ed Walsh in 1908. Tinker considered Chesbro one of the six toughest pitchers he faced in MLB.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/boston/access/710846462.html?dids=710846462:710846462&FMT=CITE&FMTS=CITE:AI&date=Apr+03%2C+1916&author=&pub=Boston+Daily+Globe&desc=SIX+HARDEST+PITCHERS+I+EVER+FACED&pqatl=google|title=Six Hardest Pitchers I Ever Faced|first=Joe|last=Tinker|newspaper=[[The Boston Globe|Boston Daily Globe]]|date=April 3, 1916|page=7|accessdate=November 25, 2011}} {{subscription required|date=November 2011}}</ref> Dan Holmes, who runs the Hall of Fame's website, called Chesbro "one of the best pitchers in the game at that time."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/sports/baseball/20050829-1607-bba-cobbs100th.html|title=A century later, Ty Cobb still hard to figure out|newspaper=[[The San Diego Union-Tribune]]|first=Paul|last=Newberry|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=August 29, 2005|accessdate=December 20, 2011}}</ref>

However, Chesbro's induction is considered dubious, as his overall career was overshadowed by his 1904 season.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=lxtVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=cj0NAAAAIBAJ&pg=5864,640421&dq=jack+chesbro+hall+of+fame&hl=en|title=Richie Ashburn singled out as worthy of Hall of Fame|newspaper=[[Reading Eagle]]|date=March 12, 1985|accessdate=December 20, 2011}}</ref> Baseball historian [[Bill James]] considers Chesbro to be undeserving of induction to the Hall of Fame.<ref name=james>{{cite news|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/newsday/access/101727905.html?dids=101727905:101727905&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Apr+03%2C+1994&author=BY+DAN+GUTMAN.+Dan+Gutman+is+the+author+of&pub=Newsday+%28Combined+editions%29&desc=BASEBALL+A+New+Lineup+For+The+Hall+of+Fame%3F&pqatl=google|title=Baseball: A New Lineup For The Hall of Fame?|newspaper=Newsday|first=Dan|last=Gutman|date=April 3, 1994|page=36}} {{subscription required|date=November 2011}}</ref> In particular, James compared Chesbro's statistics to those of former Pittsburgh Pirate teammates Phillippe (189<U+2013>109, 2.59), [[Sam Leever]] (194<U+2013>100, 2.47), and [[Jesse Tannehill]] (197<U+2013>117, 2.80), none of whom are in the Hall of Fame. In his book ''The Politics of Glory'', James charged that the induction of undeserving players created a "second tier" in the Hall of Fame.<ref name=james/> James claimed that Chesbro was inducted into the Hall of Fame solely on the basis of his 1904 season, even though other pitchers who did not make the Hall of Fame have similar career statistics.<ref name=sabr/>

==Personal life==
Chesbro married Mabel Suttleworth of [[Conway, Massachusetts]], in 1896. After his retirement, Chesbro farmed and raised poultry in Conway, where he died on November 6, 1931 of a [[myocardial infarction]];<ref name=obit>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=i_NPAAAAIBAJ&sjid=11QDAAAAIBAJ&pg=2796,3711817|title=Jack Chesbro, Pioneer of Spitball Hurlers and Ace on Old New York Highlanders, Dies of Heart Attack|newspaper=The Evening Independent|date=November 7, 1931|accessdate=November 25, 2011}}</ref> he was buried at Howland Cemetery in Conway.<ref name=sabr/> Mabel died in 1940.<ref>Fleitz, p. 61</ref>
