The '''Apalachicola Kingsnake''' (also known as the '''Apalachicola Lowlands Kingsnake''') is a non-venomous [[species]] of [[kingsnake]] found in a small area of the [[Florida]] panhandle known as the Apalachicola Lowlands. Long argued as to whether or not it is a [[sub-species]], the [[Apalachicola]] Kingsnake was formerly named ''Lampropeltis getula goini''. After years of research and many more specimens examined, in 2006 it was renamed to ''Lampropeltis getula meansi'' after D. Bruce Means, in recognition of his work on this species.
