'''''Curia regis''''' is a [[Latin]] term meaning "royal council" or "[[Noble court|king's court]]." It was the name given to councils of advisors and administrators who served early French kings as well as to those serving Norman and later kings of England.

In England the [[House of Normandy|Norman kings]] after the [[Norman conquest of England|Conquest of England]] conducted much of the business of state utilizing a council called the ''curia regis''.<ref>William A. Morris, 'The Lesser Curia Regis Under the First Two Norman Kings of England', ''The American Historical Review'', Vol. 34, No. 4 (Jul., 1929), p. 772</ref> 
It was similar to, but not the same as the [[Witenagemot]] (or Witan) which advised the [[List of Anglo-Saxon monarchs and kingdoms|Anglo-Saxon kings of England]], and the ''[[Curia Ducis]]'' which served the [[Dukes of Normandy]].<ref>William Searle Holdsworth, ''A History of English Law'', Vol. I (Boston: Little, Brown, and Company, 1922), p. 32</ref> This council existed in two forms, the great ''curia regis'' or ''[[Magnum Concilium]]'', composed of the [[tenants-in-chief]], the great officers of the king's court, and those [[:wikt:ecclesiastics|ecclesiastics]] who held lands of the king.<ref group=lower-alpha>The ecclesiastics included archbishops, bishops and certain abbots. William the Conqueror required homage of all bishops and abbots for their lands prior to their consecration, so they were summoned to the ''curia regis'' as barons. See: William A. Morris, 'The Lesser Curia Regis Under the First Two Norman Kings of England', ''The American Historical Review'', Vol. 34, No. 4 (Jul., 1929), p. 772 & notes 3, 4 and 5.</ref><ref name="DCR12">George Burton Adams, 'The Descendants of the Curia Regis', ''The American Historical Review, Vol. 13, No. 1 (Oct., 1907), p. 12</ref> This council met on special occasions and were summoned by the king. When not in session it was replaced by a smaller council which itself was in continuous session called the lesser or small ''curia regis'' made up of the king's officers of state and those [[magnates]] who were at court.<ref name="DCR12"/> The lesser ''curia regis'' was in essence the king's royal court and as such was an [[:wikt:itinerant|itinerant]] court that followed the king in all his travels.<ref name="HEL33">William Searle Holdsworth, ''A History of English Law'', Vol. I (Boston: Little, Brown, and Company, 1922), p. 33</ref> The king, when traveling throughout his realm and as an integral part of the court, often heard suitors in person.<ref name="HEL33"/>

The ''curia regis'' in either of its two forms did the business of state whether legislative, judicial, or diplomatic. These functions were executed seamlessly with no regard to specialized functions.<ref name="DCR12"/> Neither the greater or lesser ''curia regis'' was subservient to the other it was the same entity.<ref name="DCR12"/> Under the Norman kings the business of government was handled the same regardless of which curia was meeting at the time.<ref name="DCR12"/>

In judicial matters, the basis for the law remained the Anglo-Saxon Laws of [[Edward the Confessor]] which both [[William the Conqueror]] and [[Henry I of England|Henry I]] promised to uphold.<ref name="HEL33"/> The powers of the sheriffs were retained as well as those of the communal courts ([[Hundred (county subdivision)#Hundred_courts|Hundred Courts]] and [[Shire Court]]s).<ref name="HEL33"/> The ''curia regis'' attempted to maintain continuity with its predecessor as the Norman kings wanted to be seen as the lawful successors of [[Edward the Confessor]].<ref name="HEL33"/>

Gradually the ''curia regis'' began to branch off into entities which formed into other institutions,<ref group=lower-alpha>In his article, 'The Descendants of the Curia Regis', [[George Burton Adams]] has provided a simplified chart showing the major offshoots of the ''curia regis'' into branches such as the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]], the [[Cabinet (government)|Cabinet]], the [[Star Chamber]], [[Court of Chancery|Chancery]] and [[House of Lords]], and others. See: George Burton Adams, 'The Descendants of the Curia Regis', ''The American Historical Review, Vol. 13, No. 1 (Oct., 1907), pp. 11-15.</ref> one of the first being the [[exchequer]] which specialized in the financial matters of government.<ref name="DCR13">George Burton Adams, 'The Descendants of the Curia Regis', ''The American Historical Review'', Vol. 13, No. 1 (Oct., 1907), p. 13</ref> During the thirteenth century the two forms of the ''curia'' themselves began to separate.<ref name="DCR13"/> Even after a split between the two parts both continued to involve themselves in all three functions of the original ''curia'' and only slowly began to specialize in one function over the others.<ref>George Burton Adams, 'The Descendants of the Curia Regis', ''The American Historical Review'', Vol. 13, No. 1 (Oct., 1907), pp. 13-14</ref> The great ''curia regis'' after taking on representative elements formed into [[Parliament of England|Parliament]].<ref>George Burton Adams, 'The Descendants of the Curia Regis', ''The American Historical Review'', Vol. 13, No. 1 (Oct., 1907), p. 14</ref> The first mention of a court of the king's bench (''curia regis'') being termed "Parliament" was in 1236 during the [[Michaelmas]] term (of the great ''curia regis'').<ref>H. G. Richardson and G. O. Sayles, 'The Earliest Known Official Use of the Term "Parliament"', ''The English Historical Review'', Vol. 82, No. 325 (Oct., 1967), p. 747</ref>

{{main|Conseil du Roi}}
In France [[Maison du Roi|the King's Court]], called the ''Curia Regis'' in Latin, and functioned as an advisory body under the early [[House of Capet|Capetian kings]].<ref name="MFE255">William Kibler, ''Medieval France: An Encyclopedia'' (Routledge, 1995), p. 255</ref> It was composed of a number of the king's trusted advisers but only a few traveled with the king at any time.<ref name="MFE255"/> By the later twelfth century it had become a judicial body with a few branching off to remain the king's council.<ref name="MFE255"/> By the fourteenth century the term ''curia regis'' was no longer used.<ref name="MFE255"/> However, it had served as a predecessor to later sovereign assemblies; the [[Parlement]] which was a judiciary body, the Chamber of Accounts which was a financial body and [[Council of State (France)|King's Council]].<ref>Arthur Augustus Tilley, ''Medieval France: A Companion to French Studies'' (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1922), p. 72</ref>
