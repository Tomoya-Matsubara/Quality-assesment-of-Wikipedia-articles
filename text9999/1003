'''Ricardo Chambers''' (born 7 October 1984) is a [[Jamaica]]n [[track and field]] athlete who specialises in the [[400 metres]].

Competing for the [[Florida State Seminoles]], he won the [[silver medal]] over 400&nbsp;m at the 2006 [[NCAA Championships]], breaking the FSU record with a run of 44.71&nbsp;seconds.<ref>[http://www.seminoles.com/sports/c-track/mtt/chambers_ricardo00.html Ricardo Chambers Biography].

Chambers turned professional for the 2007 season and competed at the [[2007 World Championships in Athletics]]. He made it to the semi-finals of the individual 400&nbsp;m, but greater success came in the relay, as he took fourth place in the final for Jamaica. His next major competition was the [[2008 Beijing Olympics]]. He again was a semi-finalist in the men's 400&nbsp;metres, but the Jamaican relay team performed poorly in the event final, failing to match their time from the heats and finishing in last place. He was the Jamaican champion the following year, but his third global appearance <U+2013> at the [[2009 World Championships in Athletics]] <U+2013> held similar results; he finished third in his semi-final and was eliminated in the heats in the relay.<ref>[http://www.iaaf.org/athletes/biographies/country=0/athcode=199223/index.html Ricardo Chambers].
