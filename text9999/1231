The '''Carl Gustav''' (also '''Carl-Gustaf''' and '''M2CG'''; pronounced "Carl Gustaf") is a 84&nbsp;mm man-portable reusable multi-role [[recoilless rifle]] produced by [[Saab Bofors Dynamics]] (formerly [[Bofors|Bofors Anti-Armour AB]]) in [[Sweden]]. The first prototype of the Carl Gustaf was produced in 1946, and while similar weapons of the era have generally disappeared, the Carl Gustaf remains in widespread use today.

In its country of origin it is officially named ''Grg m/48'' (''Granatgev<U+00E4>r'' or grenade rifle, model 48).  British troops refer to it as the ''Charlie G'', while Canadian troops often refer to it as the ''84'', ''Carl G'' or ''Carlo''.  In U.S. military service it is known as the ''M3 Multi-role Anti-armor Anti-tank Weapon System'' (''MAAWS'') or ''Ranger Antitank Weapons System'' (''RAWS''), but is often called ''the Gustav'' or ''the Goose'' or simply the ''Carl Johnson'' by U.S. soldiers. In Australia it is irreverently known as ''Charlie Gusto'' or ''Charlie Gutsache'' ([[Gastrointestinal tract|gut]]s [[ache]], slang for stomach pain).

==History==
The Carl Gustav was developed by Hugo Abramson and Harald Jentzen at the Royal Swedish Arms Administration (KAFT) and produced at [[Bofors Carl Gustav|Carl Gustav Stads Gev<U+00E4>rsfaktori]] from where it derives its name. The weapon was first introduced into Swedish service in 1948 as the ''8,4&nbsp;cm Granatgev<U+00E4>r m/48'' (Grg m/48), filling the same [[anti-tank]] role as the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]]'s [[Bazooka]], [[United Kingdom|British]] [[PIAT]] and [[Germany|German]] [[Panzerschreck]]. Unlike these weapons, however, the Carl Gustav used a [[rifled]] [[gun barrel|barrel]] for spin-stabilizing its rounds, as opposed to fins used by the other systems.

The use of the recoilless firing system allowed the Carl Gustav to use ammunition containing considerably more propellant, firing its rounds at 290&nbsp;m/s, as opposed to about 105&nbsp;m/s for the Panzerschreck and Bazooka and about 75&nbsp;m/s for the PIAT.  The result was superior [[accuracy]] at longer ranges.  The Carl Gustav can be used to attack larger stationary targets at up to 700 m, but the relatively low speed of the [[projectile]] restricts attacks on moving targets to a range of 400 m or less.

The Carl Gustav was soon sold around the world and became one of the primary [[squad]]-level anti-tank weapons for many West European armies.  An improved version (M2) was introduced in 1964 and quickly replaced the original version.  The current M3 version was introduced in 1991, using a thin steel liner containing the rifling, strengthened by a [[carbon fiber]] outer sleeve.  External steel parts were replaced with [[aluminium]] alloys or plastics, reducing the empty weapon weight considerably<U+2014>from 16.35&nbsp;kg to 10&nbsp;kg.

In recent years, the weapon has found new life in a variety of roles. The [[British Special Air Service]], [[United States Special Forces]] and [[United States Army Rangers]] use M3s in [[bunker]]-busting and anti-vehicle roles, while the German [[Bundeswehr]] maintains a small number of M2s for battlefield illumination. Many armies continue to use it as a viable anti-armor weapon, especially against 1950s- and 1960s-era [[tank]]s and other armored vehicles still in use worldwide.

In a well-documented incident during the [[Falklands War]], a [[Royal Marines|Royal Marine]] attacked an Argentinian [[D'Estienne_d'Orves_class#In_service_in_the_Argentinian_Navy|corvette]] [[ARA Guerrico (P-32)|(ARA Guerrico)]] using a Carl Gustav.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20030507084432/http://navynews.co.uk/falklands/stories/8202040301.asp Navy News - The Falklands Conflict - 3rd April 1982 - The Defence of Grytviken].</ref>

The Carl Gustav was used against [[Taliban]] defensive fortifications by soldiers of [[Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry]] in operations in [[Afghanistan]]. They developed a new system for firing at night in which a spotter with a [[night-scope]] fires [[tracer ammunition]] to mark the target for the Carl Gustav gunner.{{Citation needed|reason=I don't doubt that this happened, but we need a source|date=July 2010}}

Carl Gustav launchers were used by [[National Liberation Army (Libya)|Free Libyan Army]] during the [[Libyan civil war]] in 2011; the weapons being used were either captured or provided by defecting members of the [[Libyan Army (1951<U+2013>2011)|Libyan Army]].

In November 2011, the U.S. Army began ordering the M3 MAAWS for regular units deployed in Afghanistan.  Soldiers were being engaged with RPGs at 900 meters, while their light weapons had effective ranges of 500-600 meters.  The Carl Gustaf allows airburst capability of troops in [[defilade]] out to 1,250 meters, and high explosive use out to 1,300 meters.  While the weapon provides enhanced effectiveness, its 21 pound weight burdens troops.  On 28 March 2013, USSOCOM announced a call for sources to develop a kit to lighten the M3 MAAWS.  A minimum of 3 lbs must be cut, with a desired reduction of 5 lbs.  A 3 inch reduction in overall length is also sought.  The reductions must not affect the weapon's center of gravity or ruggedness, including air delivery and salt water submersion.  A kit with production configuration is to be delivered within 16 months.  Saab has developed a weight-reduced version prior to the SOCOM release.  It weighs approximately 15 lbs and is 2 inches shorter.  Live fire tests have demonstrated no decrease in performance, no increase in recoil, and nearly equivalent barrel life.  It will be ready for government testing in 2014.  Saab has also developed a new high explosive round that has a direct fire range of 1500 meters when using a fire control system.<ref>[http://www.defensemedianetwork.com/stories/socom-seeks-lighter-carl-gustaf/ SOCOM Seeks Lighter Carl Gustaf] - Defensemedianetwork.com, 22 April 2013</ref>

==Description==
[[File:US Special Forces soldier fires a Carl Gustav rocket during a training exercise conducted in Basrah Iraq.jpg|thumb|right|In May 2009, [[U.S. Army Special Forces]] soldiers train with the Carl Gustav recoilless rifle in [[Basra, Iraq]], during the [[Iraq War]]. Note the firing position and recoilless backblast.]]

The basic weapon consists of the main tube with the breech-mounted [[Venturi effect|Venturi]] recoil damper, with two grips near the front and a shoulder mount. The weapon is fitted with [[iron sight]]s, but is normally aimed with the attached 3x [[optical sight]] with a 17 degree (300 mrad) [[field of view]]. The most modern variants fielded to Swedish rifle companies have been fitted with the Swedish aimpoint sighting system.  Luminous front and rear sight inserts are available for the iron sights when aiming at night, and an [[Night vision device|image intensification]] system may also be used.

The Carl Gustav can be fired from the standing, kneeling, sitting or prone positions, and a [[bipod]] may be attached in front of the shoulder piece. An operating handle called the "Venturi lock" is used to move the hinged breech to one side for reloading. The weapon is normally operated by a two-man crew, one carrying and firing the weapon, the other carrying ammunition and reloading.

===M3 MAAWS===
The '''M3 Multi-role Anti-armor Anti-tank Weapon System (MAAWS)''' is the U.S. military designation for the Carl Gustaf M3 recoilless rifle. It is primarily used by [[United States Special Operations Command|USSOCOM]] forces such as the [[United States Army Special Forces|Army Special Forces]], [[75th Ranger Regiment (United States)|75th Ranger Regiment]], [[United States Navy SEALs|Navy SEALS]], [[Delta Force]], [[DEVGRU]] and [[MARSOC]].  When in use with the 75th Ranger Regiment it is known as the '''Ranger Anti-tank Weapons System (RAWS)'''.

In the late 1980s, the Special Operations Forces Modernization Action Plan indicated need for a Ranger Anti-Armor/Anti-Personnel Weapon System (RAAWS) to replace the [[M67 recoilless rifle]] in use by the 75th Ranger Regiment.  A market survey in 1987 indicated that the Carl Gustaf M3 was the best candidate for satisfying RAAWS requirements.  On 29 September 1988, the M3 was selected as the RAAWS from candidate proposals submitted in response to the market survey compiled by [[ARDEC]].  A subsequent review of the contractor-supplied fatigue test data determined that the data did not meet U.S. Army requirements.  [[Ben<U+00E9>t Laboratories]] conducted fatigue test of 2 tubes to establish an interim safe service life for the weapon.  Tests were conducted in 1993.  The manufacturer<U+2019>s recommended life for the weapon was 500 rounds, but bore surfaces showed no indications of erosion until 2,360 rounds.  The U.S. Navy SEALs became interested in the program and moved it to a Joint Integrated Product Team.  The program name subsequently changed from the RAAWS to the Multi-Role Anti-Armor/Anti-Personnel Weapon System (MAAWS).<ref name="M3">[http://sadefensejournal.com/wp/?p=1962 Saab to Supply Carl-Gustaf 84mm Recoilless Rifle System to the U.S. Army] - SAdefensejournal.com, 19 June 2013</ref>

The M3 MAAWS fires the following ammunition:
* High Explosive Dual Purpose (HEDP) round
* [[High Explosive Anti-Tank]] (HEAT) round
* [[Explosive material|High Explosive]] (HE) round
* Illumination round
* Smoke round
* Area Defence Munition (ADM) [[flechette]] round

In late 2012, the Army fielded 58 M3s and 1,500 rounds of ammunition to units deployed to Afghanistan to destroy enemy targets out to 1,000 meters.  This was because RPG and machine gun teams could attack 900 meters away, while existing weaponry like the [[M141 Bunker Defeat Munition]], [[M72 LAW]], [[M136 AT-4]] and [[Shoulder-launched Multipurpose Assault Weapon|MK153 SMAW]] had effective ranges of only 500 meters.  The AT-4 is lighter and cheaper but is made of reinforced fiberglass, while the M3's rifled metal/carbon fiber launch tube allows for reloading.  Employing the 22 lb M3 is easier than the 50 lb [[FGM-148 Javelin]] with its launcher with missile and reusable command launch unit, is faster than waiting on mortars, and is cheaper than the Javelin and artillery shells for engaging targets in hard cover.<ref name="M3"/>

===Ammunition===
[[Image:MSPO2007-40.jpg|thumb|Carl Gustav recoilless rifle round ammunition on display in 2007.]]

Improvements to the ammunition have been continual.  While the older [[HEAT]] rounds are not particularly effective against modern tank armor, the weapon has found new life as a bunker-buster with an [[HEAT#High explosive dual purpose|HEDP]] round. In addition, improved HEAT, [[high explosive]] (HE), smoke and illumination (star shell or [[flare]]) ammunition is also available. For full effectiveness, illumination rounds have to be fired at a very high angle, creating a danger for the gunner as the backblast from firing can burn him. For this reason several armies have retired the illumination rounds, while the U.S. Army requires that they be fired from a standing position.

Note that the following are Canadian designations (other countries use similar terminology, replacing the "FFV")

* FFV441 is an HE round, useful in a "lobbed" trajectory to 1,000m, which can be fused to either detonate on impact or as an [[air burst|airburst]].
* FFV441B is an HE round with an effective range against personnel in the open of 1,100 m.  The round arms after 20 to 70 m of flight, weighs 3.1&nbsp;kg, and is fired at a muzzle velocity of 255&nbsp;m/s.<ref name="opfor"/>
* FFV469 is a smoke round fired like the FFV441, with a range of about 1,300 m.  The 3.1&nbsp;kg round is also fired at 255&nbsp;m/s.<ref name="opfor"/>
* FFV502 is an HEDP round with the ability to be set to detonate either on impact or one-tenth of a second afterwards.  Effective range is 1,000 m against dispersed [[soft target]]s such as infantry in the open, 500 m against stationary targets and 300 m against moving targets.  Minimum range is 15 to 40 m to arm the warhead.  Penetration exceeds 150&nbsp;mm of [[rolled homogeneous armour]] (RHA).  Ammunition weight is 3.3&nbsp;kg and muzzle velocity is 230&nbsp;m/s.<ref name="opfor"/>
* FFV545 is an illuminating star shell, fired up to 2,300 m maximum range, but with an effective envelope of 300 to 2,100 m.  Suspended by parachute, the star shell burns for 30 seconds while producing 650,000 [[candela]], providing a 400 to 500 m diameter area of illumination.
* FFV551 is the primary HEAT round and is a rocket-assisted projectile (RAP). Effective range is up to 700 m (400 m against moving targets) and penetration up to 400&nbsp;mm of RHA.  Ammunition weight is 3.2&nbsp;kg and muzzle velocity is 255&nbsp;m/s.<ref name="opfor"/>
* FFV552 is a practice round with the same ballistics as the 551.
* FFV651 is a newer HEAT round using mid-flight rocket assistance for ranges up to 1,000m. In theory, it has less penetration than the FFV551, but it includes a stand-off probe for the fuse to improve performance against [[reactive armour]].
* FFV751 is a [[tandem-warhead]] HEAT round with an effective range of 500 m and ability to penetrate more than 500&nbsp;mm of armour.  Weight is 4&nbsp;kg.<ref name="opfor"/>
