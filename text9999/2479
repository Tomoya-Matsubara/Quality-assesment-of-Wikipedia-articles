The population as of the [[United States Census, 2010|2010 Census]] was 123.<ref>[http://mcdc.missouri.edu/webrepts/pl94trends/Colorado_stplace2.html Colorado Trend Report 2: State and Complete Places (Sub-state 2010 Census Data).] Missouri Census Data Center. Accessed 2011-02-25.</ref> It is located east of [[Glenwood Springs, Colorado]], off exit 119 of [[Interstate 70]] in [[Glenwood Canyon]]. It is named for No Name Creek and No Name Canyon. The [[No Name Tunnel]] of I-70 is nearby.
The exit sign for No Name is visible in passing in the film ''[[Vanishing Point (1971 film)|Vanishing Point]]''.

When the [[Interstate 70 in Colorado]] was being built, developers planned an exit at a then unnamed area. They decided to mark the exit sign "No Name" and, after the area was built up, the name stuck.<ref>{{cite book | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=29zh3dIgmv8C&lpg=PP1&pg=PA147#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=Welcome to Horneytown, North Carolina, Population: 15: An insider's guide to 201 of the world's weirdest and wildest places | publisher=Adams Media | author=Parker, Quentin | year=Jul 18, 2010}}</ref>
