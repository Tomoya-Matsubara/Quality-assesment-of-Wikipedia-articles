'''Adrian Sanford Fisher''' ([[January 21]], [[1914]] - [[July 4]], [[1983]]) was an [[United States|American]] [[lawyer]] and federal public servant, who served from the late 1930s through the early 1980s. He was associated with the [[United States War Department]] and [[United States State Department]] throughout his professional career, and participated in the [[U.S. Government]]'s decision of [[Japanese-American internment]], the [[Nuremberg Trials]], State Department [[Cold War]] activities during the [[Truman Administration]], and acted as a senior legal advisor to [[Secretary of State]] [[Dean Acheson]].  During the [[John F. Kennedy]], [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] and [[Jimmy Carter]] administrations, Fisher was directly involved in the negotiations of international [[nuclear testing]] and [[non-proliferation]] agreements.    

== Early life and early government career  ==
Fisher was born in [[Memphis]], [[Tennessee]], and attended elite schools such as [[Groton School]], [[Princeton University]] ([[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] 1934) and [[Harvard Law School]] ([[Master of Laws|LLM]] 1937).<ref>{{cite web | author= John Woolley and Gerhard Peters | title="U.S. Representative to the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament Nomination of Adrian S.

Fisher was admitted to the [[Tennessee]] Bar in 1938, and had the distinction of clerking for two [[U.S. Supreme Court]] Justices, [[Louis Brandeis]] (1938-39) and [[Felix Frankfurter]] (1939-40). <ref>{{cite web | year= 1969-70 | title="Oral History Interview with James H. Rowe, page 72" |work= Harry S. Truman Library| url=http://www.trumanlibrary.org/oralhist/rowejh.htm | accessdate= May 13| accessyear=2007}}</ref> Fisher began his legal career with his appointment as [[Law Clerk]] to Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis, who was then 82 years old.  In early 1939, Brandeis announced his retirement from the Supreme Court, and Fisher was invited to transfer to the chambers of the newly appointed Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter. Following his term as Frankfurter's clerk in 1940, Fisher joined the [[United States Department of State]] as the assistant chief of the [[Foreign Funds Control Division]] of the State Department, where he served until shortly after the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] [[attack on Pearl Harbor]].<ref>{{cite web | author= Paige Mulhollan, Interviewer | year= 1968  | title="Transcript, Adrian S.

== World War II government and military service  ==
In early 1942, Fisher and [[John J. McCloy]] were assigned to assist implementation of the [[War Department]]'s legal activities for the [[Japanese American internment]] programs shortly after the [[United States]] entered [[World War II]]. <ref>{{cite web | author= Malick W.Gachem and Daniel Gordon  | title="From Emergency Law to Legal Process: Herbert Wechsler and the Second World War" | url=http://www.umass.edu/history/5chs/gordon.pdf | accessdate= April 7| accessyear=2007}}</ref> In late 1942, Fisher received an officer's [[commission]], and trained as a [[bomber]] [[navigator]] in the [[United States Army Air Forces]] from 1942 to 1943, with missions over [[France]], [[Belgium]] and [[Germany]]. In 1944, he returned to [[Washington, D.C.]] as an assistant to the Assistant [[Secretary of War]], John J. McCloy.

=== Korematsu Supreme Court Case ===

In 1944, Fisher again was required to become involved in the U.S. 1942-43 [[internment]] of [[Japanese Americans]] on the West Coast of the United States upon his return from [[Europe]]. At that time, the case of ''[[Korematsu v. United States]]'', challenging the U.S. government<U+2019>s power to exclude citizens of [[Japanese people|Japanese]] ancestry from military zones, came before the [[United States Supreme Court]]. While the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]]'s [[Herbert Wechsler]] (Assistant U.S. Attorney) was in charge of defending the government's position before the Supreme Court, significant consultation with Fisher was required, as he was again with the legal affairs section of the [[War Department]].<ref>{{cite web | author= Malick W. Ghachem and Daniel Gordon | title="From Emergency Law to Legal Process: Herbert Wechsler and the Second World War, pp 8-11." | url=http://www.umass.edu/history/5chs/gordon.pdf | accessdate= May 7| accessyear=2007}}</ref> During this period, Fisher was involved in critical drafting of the government's brief submitted to the Supreme Court.

=== Nuremberg trials ===

In 1945 and 1946, [[Captain]] Fisher served as legal advisor to Judge [[Francis Biddle]], the United States Judge to the [[International Military Tribunal]] ([[Nuremberg Trials]]). Fisher assisted in the drafting of the [[London Charter of the International Military Tribunal]], which created the legal basis for the Nuremberg trials,<ref>{{cite web | author= Paige Mulhollan, Interviewer | year= 1968  | title="Transcript, Adrian S. Fisher Oral History Interview I, 10/31/68" | work= Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum | url=http://www.lbjlib.utexas.edu/johnson/archives.hom/oralhistory.hom/Fisher-A/Fisher.asp| accessdate= April 1| accessyear=2007}}</ref> and later was the principal drafter of the Tribunal's memorandum on the [[Nazi]] leadership's "conspiracies to engage in crimes against peace." This document covered the period from 1920 to November 1937, where he demonstrated that the pace of re-armament under [[Adolf Hitler]] showed that the Germans "were developing an economic system which was only sensible only if there should be a war."<ref> Telford Taylor, "The Anatomy of the Nuremberg Trials" (Little Brown & Co. 1992)pp553-4</ref>

== Return to Washington, D.C. and service with Dean Acheson ==

Upon his return from Europe and exit from the Army Air Force, Fisher served as [[Solicitor]] for the U.S. [[Department of Commerce]] from 1947 to 1948. Thereafter, Fisher became general counsel of the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] from 1948-49. He then served as legal advisor (with the rank of Assistant Secretary of State) to the [[Department of State]] (serving in the office of Secretary of State [[Dean Acheson]]) from 1949 to 1953. <ref>{{cite web |  title="Legal Advisors to U.S. Department of State" | url=http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ho/po/12106.htm  | accessdate= April 7| accessyear=2007}}</ref> During 1952, Mr. Fisher also served as legal advisor to the U.S. Delegation to the [[United Nations]] in [[Paris, France|Paris]].<ref>{{cite web | author= Paige Mulhollan, Interviewer | year= 1968  | title="Transcript, Adrian S. Fisher Oral History Interviews I and II, 10/31/68" | work= Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum | url=http://www.lbjlib.utexas.edu/johnson/archives.hom/oralhistory.hom/Fisher-A/Fisher.asp| accessdate= April 1| accessyear=2007}}</ref>  

In 1952, Fisher was also appointed by President [[Harry S Truman]] as an original commissioner to the President's [[Commission on Immigration and Naturalization]]. The Commission was established in the [[Executive Office of the President]] by Executive Order 10392 "Establishing the President's Commission on Immigration and Naturalization" <ref>3 CFR, 1949-1953 Comp., p. 896</ref>.<ref>{{cite web | title="Statement by the President Upon Issuing Order Establishing a Commission on Immigration and Naturalization: Presidential Paper Historical Series"|   url=https://www.ilw.com/articles/2003,1201-truman.shtm  | accessdate= May 8| accessyear=2007}}</ref>  The specific context for the 1952 commission was the enactment of the [[McCarren-Walter Act]], which was passed over President Truman's veto. Truman's main disagreement with the Act was its retention of the quota system that began in 1924. After Congress passed the Act over his [[veto]], he formed the Commission and charged it with looking into new options for [[immigration]] and [[naturalization]] policy. 

Secretary of State Acheson's appointment of Fisher as the State Department's [[Legal Adviser]] was unique at the time, because of the closeness of the Acheson/Fisher professional relationship.  Fisher's role as Acheson's legal adviser was explained by Michael H. Cordozo, the State Department's Assistant Legal Adviser for Economic Affairs, 1950-52:

<blockquote>
(Acheson) insisted on having, as a legal adviser, a lawyer whose ability as a lawyer and whose judgment in politics and statesmanship could be greatly respected. He got Adrian Fisher for that, and he involved him in all of the political and other activities that he himself was involved in. The Secretary of State always is involved in a lot of controversial things, and here we had the McCarthy era, the attack on the whole concept of Foreign Service and the State Department, and a terrific controversy over what to do about China, who had "lost China." Fisher was always at Acheson's right hand when he was dealing with other people about these things. Wherever he went, Fisher's office was backstopping him, getting all the necessary background information so he'd be prepared for any kind of question that came up. Of course, Acheson's own approach to being Secretary of State was such that when you took an agreement to him to be signed, his chief question was "By what authority do I sign this?" And whoever brought it to him to get it signed, had to be ready with the answer that would satisfy a lawyer -- "by what legal authority" -- as well as what it provides and so forth. <ref>{{cite web |  title="Truman Library Oral History of Michael H. Cordozo, pages 52-53." | url=http://www.trumanlibrary.org/oralhist/cardozom.htm  | accessdate= May 5 | accessyear=2007}}</ref></blockquote>

=== Building the H-bomb ===
In late 1949, President Truman asked [[Dean Acheson]] to concentrate on the question of whether the United States should develop the [[hydrogen bomb]]. Acheson formed a working group under the [[United States National Security Council]] (NSC) executive secretary [[Sidney Souers]], consisting of [[R. Gordon Arneson]], [[Paul Nitze]] and Fisher, who served as the State Department's legal adviser on the project. <ref>{{cite web |  title="Truman Library Oral History of R. Gordon Arneson, page 62." | url=http://www.trumanlibrary.org/oralhist/arneson.htm  | accessdate= May 5 | accessyear=2007}}</ref> It was Arneson's view that each member of the working group were of one mind. He said, "The four principals in the State Department were Acheson, Nitze, Fisher and myself. I don't think it was necessary for any one of us to persuade anybody else; we all were of a mind that there really wasn't any choice." <ref>{{cite web |  title="Truman Library Oral History of R. Gordon Arneson, page 62." | url=http://www.trumanlibrary.org/oralhist/arneson.htm  | accessdate= May 5 | accessyear=2007}}</ref>

Fisher was part of this same working group which recommended that an internal [[NSC]] study be conducted on the overall U.S. [[foreign policy]] as it pertained to the newly developing "[[Cold War]]". This classified study (declassified in 1977) called [[NSC-68]], was the blueprint for the [[Truman Doctrine]] for [[containment]] of [[communism]], which provided the overall policy concepts for the U.S. participation in the Cold War throughout the 1950s. <ref>{{cite web |  title="NSC 68: United States Objectives and Programs for National Security" | url=http://www.fas.org/irp/offdocs/nsc-hst/nsc-68-cr.htm  | accessdate= May 5 | accessyear=2007}}</ref>

=== Congressional Hearings on the firing of General Douglas MacArthur ===
On [[April 11]], [[1951]], President Truman announced the dismissal of General [[Douglas MacArthur]] from his duties as Allied Commander of [[United Nations]] forces in the [[Far East]]. Following MacArthur's firing and the subsequent public outcry, the Joint Committee on Armed Services and Foreign Relations of the [[United States Senate]] conducted an inquiry into removal of MacArthur. Fisher was assigned the responsibility for the coordination of the [[State Department]] Congressional testimony regarding the firing of General MacArthur.

=== Fisher and the Acheson Capitol Hill fist-fight === 
In August 1950, Fisher was involved in an incident between Secretary of State [[Dean Acheson]] and Senator [[Kenneth S. Wherry]], [[Nebraska]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] and [[minority whip]] of the [[United States Senate]], during a hearing before the [[Senate Foreign Relations Committee]]. During the hearing, Senator Wherry began to harangue Acheson about events in [[Korea]]. Suddenly, Acheson jumped out of his chair towards Wherry, with fists raised. Fisher was required to physically hold Acheson back from striking  Wherry. As the incident was told by eye-witness John H. Ohly, then the Assistant Director, Office of International Security Affairs, Department of State,
<blockquote>
"The next day the administration threw in its big guns -- Secretary Acheson, Louis Johnson, and, from ECA, William Foster. This time the going was really rough from the Republican side of the table and Acheson consciously lost his temper over some of Wherry's remarks and got up and tried to slug him. Adrian Fisher, State Department Legal Adviser and a close friend of Acheson, caught his arm, fortunately, because Acheson would have missed Wherry by about three feet and probably fallen flat on his face on the floor. It was a great show."<ref>{{cite web | title="Truman Library Oral History of John H. Ohly, page 134." | url=http://www.trumanlibrary.org/oralhist/ohly.htm | accessdate= May 5 | accessyear=2007}}</ref></blockquote>

This scene was portrayed in the film "[[The Manchurian Candidate]]", with [[Frank Sinatra]] (as Major Marco) taking on Fisher's role of restraining (in that instance) the [[Secretary of Defense]]. <ref>{{cite web | author=Carol Bundy | year= 2005 | title="How Close to the Truth Was the Manchurian Candidate?" | work= George Mason University's History News Network | url=http://hnn.us/articles/10787.html| accessdate= April 7| accessyear=2007}}</ref>

From 1961 to 1968, Fisher served as the Deputy Director of the U.S. [[Arms Control and Disarmament Agency]] in which he took a primary negotiations role during the [[Atomic Test Ban Treaty]] of 1963 between the U.S. and the [[Soviet Union]]. At that time he was Deputy to [[John J. McCloy]], Adviser to the President on [[Disarmament]]. In 1968, Fisher served as one of the chief U.S. negotiators of the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]], which was signed by the United States, the [[United Kingdom]], the Soviet Union, and 59 other countries on [[July 1]], [[1968]].<ref>Testimony of Eldon Greeberg on Assessing "Rights" Under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty before the Subcommittee on International Terrorism and Nonproliferation of the House Committee on International Relations, Washington, D.C., March 2,2006, http://www.nci.org/06nci/03/NPTTestimony-v2.htm</ref> A collection of letters from Adrian Fisher to President Johnson and Secretary of State [[Dean Rusk]] regarding his perception and activities on arms control and disarmament is maintained by the [[Federation of American Scientists]].

== Return to private law practice and academics ==
In 1968, Fisher re-entered private [[law practice]], again with [[Covington & Burling]] (during the [[Eisenhower]] Administration (1953-60) Fisher joined the Covington firm, with [[Dean Acheson]], for the first time) and became General Counsel to the ''[[Washington Post]]''.<ref>{{cite web | author= Paige Mulhollan, Interviewer | year= 1968  | title="Transcript, Adrian S.

Both Fisher and Graham had clerked for Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter and had shared a rented house (belonging to future Secretary of State Dean Acheson), together with  [[Donald Hiss]] (brother of [[Alger Hiss]]).<ref> Unpublished interview with former Fisher Law Clerk Scott Clarkson,June 1, 2007.</ref> From 1969 to 1975, Fisher served as [[Dean]] of [[Georgetown University Law Center]], [[Washington, D.C.]] <ref>{{cite web |  title="Georgetown Law Center Campus Completion Project - Construction Notes" | url=https://www.law.georgetown.edu/ccp/notes.html | accessdate= April 7| accessyear=2007}}</ref> Dean Fisher was installed as the first occupant of the [[Francis Cabell Brown]] Chair in [[International Law]] of the center on [[January 25]], [[1977]], and served as [[law professor]] from 1977 to 1980.

== U.S. Disarmament Representative ==
[[President Jimmy Carter]] nominated Fisher for the rank of [[Ambassador]] while serving as the U.S. Representative to the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament in 1977, where he served through 1981.<ref>{{cite web |  title="John Woolley and Gerhard Peters, The American Presidency Project" | url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/print.php?pid=7508
 | accessdate= April 7| accessyear=2007}}</ref>
With the [[United States]] represented by Fisher, the first Special Session on Disarmament of the [[United Nations General Assembly]] was held in 1978 and led to the established in 1979 of the U.N. [[Conference on Disarmament]] as the single multilateral disarmament negotiating forum of the international community. <ref>{{cite web |  title="Disarmament in Geneva" | url=http://www.unog.ch/80256EE600585943/(httpHomepages)/6A03113D1857348E80256F04006755F6?OpenDocument
 | accessdate= May 6| accessyear=2007}}</ref>

== Return to academics ==
In 1981, Fisher joined the faculty of [[George Mason University School of Law]] in [[Arlington]], [[Virginia]], teaching various seminars on negotiation tactics. The [[George Mason Law Review]] named its annual award for best student article in honor of Mr. Fisher. From 1981 to 1982, Mr. Fisher also served as an advisor to [[John J. McCloy]] during the hearings of the [[Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians]] (established by Congress in 1980). This commission reviewed the impact of [[Executive Order 9066]] on [[Japanese-Americans]] and determined that they were the victims of [[discrimination]] by the Federal government. Fisher died on [[July 4]], [[1983]], aged 69, from [[cancer]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]
