[[FBI Special agent]] '''Jeffrey Frank Spender''' is a [[fictional character]] in the American [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] television series ''[[The X-Files]]'', a [[science fiction]] show about a [[conspiracy theory|government conspiracy]] to hide or deny the truth of [[Colonist (The X-Files)|alien existence]]. Spender, along with his partner, [[Diana Fowley]] was in control of the [[x-file|X-Files]] office after [[Fox Mulder]] and [[Dana Scully]]'s forced leaves in "[[The Beginning (The X-Files)|The Beginning]]". The X-Files office is concerned with cases with particularly mysterious or possibly supernatural circumstances that were left unsolved and shelved by the FBI. Portrayed by [[Canada|Canadian]] actor [[Chris Owens]], Spender was a [[recurring character]] during the fifth, sixth and final season of ''The X-Files''. 

[[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] [[Special agent]] Spender made his first appearance in the [[The X-Files (season 5)|fifth season]] 1998 episode "[[Patient X]]". During his earlier appearances in the series, because of Mulder's belief in [[extraterrestial life]], Spender acted [[unfriendly]] towards him. But when re-appearing in the ninth season, Spender had moved on to respect and agree with Mulder's belief's, which is proven to him in "[[Two Fathers]]", when he sees and helps to kill an [[alien rebel]].

== Character arc ==
Spender was a [[skeptic]] who was assigned to [[X-file|The X-Files]] after [[Fox Mulder]]'s [[The Beginning (The X-Files)|forced leave]]. Spender is the son of the "[[Cigarette Smoking Man]]", and the "Cigarette Smoking Man's" ex-wife, multiple abductee [[Cassandra Spender]]. Heavily involved in the [[Syndicate (The X-Files)|Syndicate]] at that time, the "Cigarette Smoking Man" abandoned the family when Spender was 12 years old.<ref name="The_Red_and_the_Black">{{cite episode| title=The Red and the Black | series=The X-Files | serieslink= |credits = ''Director:'' [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] ''Writer(s):'' Chris Carter & [[Frank Spotnitz]] | network = [[Fox Broadcasting Company]] | season = 5 | number = 14}}</ref> Subsequently, his mother was driven insane by what she claims were multiple alien abductions.<ref name="The_Red_and_the_Black"/> Shortly after [[Samantha Mulder]] was abducted and then returned, Jeffrey and Samantha were raised together by his father in [[California]].<ref name="Closure">{{cite episode| title=Closure | series=The X-Files |credits = ''Director:'' [[Kim Manners]] ''Writer(s):'' [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] & [[Frank Spotnitz]] | network = [[Fox Broadcasting Company]] | season = 7 | number = 11}}</ref> Spender met Agents [[Fox Mulder]] and [[Dana Scully]] in 1997.

Three years later it is revealed in "[[William (The X-Files)|William]]", that he survived the gunshot, but was subjected to horribly disfiguring experiments at the hand of his father. Posing as Mulder, he infiltrated Scully's house, and injected [[Baby William|William]] with a [[magnetite]] substance to seemingly "cure" the baby of his telekinetic powers. The motivation or repercussions of his actions are never fully explained.<ref name="William">{{cite episode| episodelink= | title=William | series=The X-Files | serieslink= |credits = ''Director:'' [[David Duchovny]] ''Writer(s):'' David Duchovny, [[Frank Spotnitz]] & [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] | network = [[Fox Broadcasting Company]] | season = 9 | number = 16}}</ref> He testified for the defense during Mulder's murder trial in "[[The Truth (The X-Files episode)|The Truth]]". He also revealed during the trial that [[Teena Mulder]] was having an affair with the "Cigarette Smoking Man", and that he and [[Fox Mulder]] are half-brothers. A DNA test conducted on a disfigured Spender in the episode "William" initially led agents Scully, Doggett and Reyes to believe he was Mulder thus lending further credence to Spender's claim that both he and Mulder are the children of the "Cigarette Smoking Man".<ref name="The_Truth">{{cite episode| episodelink= | title=The Truth | series=The X-Files | serieslink= | credits = ''Director:'' [[Kim Manners]] ''Writer(s):'' [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] | network = [[Fox Broadcasting Company]] | season = 9  | number = 19-20}}</ref>

== Conceptual history ==
=== Creation and early development ===
[[Chris Owens]] had previously portrayed the [[Cigarette Smoking Man]] in the episodes, "[[Musings of a Cigarette Smoking Man]]" and "[[Demons (The X-Files)|Demons]]", he had portrayed The Great Mutato in "[[The Post-Modern Prometheus]]" on the show before getting casted as Spender. Owens had also landed a guest role on ''[[The X-Files]]'' [[spin-off]] ''[[Millennium (TV series)|Millennium]]''.<ref>{{cite news | author= | url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_1999_Jan_8/ai_53536831/?tag=content;col1 | title=''X-Files'' Actor Joins Back Stage West Actorfest 99 | publisher=''Business Wire'' | date=January 8, 1999 | accessdate=August 28, 2009 }}</ref> [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] and [[David Duchovny]] was so pleased with his portrayal of The Great Mutato that he was picked for the role, without making an audition. Most of the crew members reacted positively to the selection.<ref name="Commentary">{{cite video |people=[[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Carter, Chris]] |year2=2005 |title=Audio Commentary for "The Red and the Black" |medium= DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox Home Entertainment}}</ref> When creating the character of Spender, Carter had no long term plans for Owens involvement, meaning that Spender's involvement wouldn't differ much from different previous recurring characters of the show.<ref>{{cite news | author= Gray, Tyler | url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/orlandosentinel/access/26604647.html?dids=26604647:26604647&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Feb+24%2C+1998&author=Tyler+Gray+of+The+Sentinel+Staff&pub=Orlando+Sentinel&desc=SPECIAL+AGENT+WILL+ASSIST+SCULLY%2C+MULDER&pqatl=google | title=Special Agent Will Assist Scully, Mulder | publisher=''Orlando Sentinel'' | date=February 24, 1998 | accessdate=August 28, 2009 }}</ref> Michal Suchanek made a small cameo appearance in "[[The Red and the Black (The X-Files)|The Red and the Black]]" as a young version of Spender.<ref name="The_Red_and_the_Black"/>

However, as the [[The X-Files (season 5)|fifth season]]'s production period entered its final months, rumors began to circulate <U+2013> especially among the production crew members in [[Vancouver, Canada]] <U+2013> about the future of the series, particularly concerning whether the show would be moving to [[Los Angeles, California]] for the [[The X-Files (season 6)|sixth season]] and whether the new [[recurring character]] of Jeffrey Spender was planned (in case [[David Duchovny]] cut back his commitment to the series) to become a replacement for Duchovny's character of [[Fox Mulder]] <U+2013> either as a part-time or fully-fledged substitute.<ref name="rumour"/> Other, contradictory rumors that Owens heard were that either he or Duchovny would appear in only eight episodes of the sixth season and that his casting as Spender was a sign that the series would either be leaving Vancouver or staying there.<ref name="rumour"/> According to the actor himself, he always knew that Duchovny would not be leaving the series but only discovered that The X-Files would indeed be moving to Los Angeles when the official announcement was made.<ref name="rumour">{{cite book | year=1999 | author=Meisler, Andy | title=Resist or Serve: The Official Guide to The X-Files Volume 4 |page=294 |publisher=Harper Prism}} </ref>

According to Owens, he first learned of Spender's seeming demise in "[[One Son]]" via the usual way &ndash; when Chris Carter phoned the actor to discuss his latest script &ndash; and, upon Carter telling him that Jeffrey Spender would make an heroic exit from the series' story arc, Owens questioned himself about this news as he was slightly unable to believe that he was leaving the series so soon. Apparently, the news of Spender's departure from the series was confirmed for him shortly thereafter, however, when he received the episode's script.<ref>{{cite book | year=2008 | author=Hurwitz, Matt & Knowles, Chris | title=The Complete X-Files: Behind the Series, the Myths and the Movies |page=98-99 |publisher=Insight Editions}}</ref>

When it came time to film Spender's final scene in "[[One Son]]", actor [[William B. Davis]] became upset, saying that he didn't want to shoot Owens and adding that he enjoyed working with the actor. On the other hand, Davis had no trouble with slapping Owens, in a scene of "[[Two Fathers]]" in which Spender is twice hit by the Cigarette Smoking Man.<ref>{{cite book | year=1999 | author=Meisler, Andy | title=The End and the Beginning: The Official Guide to The X-Files, volume 5 |page=284 |publisher=Harper Prism }} </ref>

=== Later development in Season 9 ===

Three years after Spender had been written out of the series and actor [[Chris Owens]] had moved to [[Toronto, Canada]], Owens received an unexpected phone call from [[David Duchovny]], who said that ''[[The X-Files]]''{{'}} production crew was filming the series' finale as well as the [[William (The X-Files)|second-to-last episode]] and that he wanted to bring Spender back for these two episodes. Duchovny reassured Owens that Spender's survival of the shooting years earlier could be explained away via the plot device of an alien injection but mentioned that the experience would not be fun for Owens, as he would be "under all that shit"; Owens did not realize what Duchovny meant until he got to the studio and personally saw the makeup for Spender's disfigured appearance, a sight that shocked Owens.<ref>{{cite book | year=2008 | author=Hurwitz, Matt & Knowles, Chris | title=The Complete X-Files: Behind the Series, the Myths and the Movies |page=100 |publisher=Insight Editions }} </ref>

== Reception ==
''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' writer Ken Tucker called [[Chris Owens]] portrayal of Spender "gloriously stiff-necked".<ref>{{cite news | author= Tucker, Ken | url= http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,285673,00.html | title=Super Freaks | publisher=''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' | date= November 13, 1998 | accessdate=August 28, 2009 }}</ref> Lon Grahnke from ''[[The Chicago Sun-Times]]'' responded positive to the character, calling Spender "devious".<ref>{{cite news | author= Grahnke, Lon | title='End' is near

He assumed their odd expressions were those of "annoyance" with his character because of his actions. One day, one particularly aggravated fan of the series actually shook his finger at Owens and called him a "Paper shredder!".<ref>{{cite book | year=2000 | author=Meisler, Andy | title=The End and the Beginning: The Official Guide to The X-Files, volume 5 |page=150 |publisher=Harper Prism }} </ref>
