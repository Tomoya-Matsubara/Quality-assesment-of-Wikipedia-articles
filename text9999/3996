According to [[Slavic languages|Slavonic]] chronicles, she was the mother of [[Vladimir the Great]] and sister of [[Dobrynya]]. The [[Norse saga]]s describe Vladimir's mother as a prophetess who lived to the age of 100 and was brought from her cave to the palace to predict the future. She was most probably of [[Northmen|Northern]] origin.<ref>http://books.google.com/books?id=qTgMAQAAMAAJ&q=%22was+most+probably+of+Northern%22&dq=%22was+most+probably+of+Northern%22&hl=no&ei=KBABTsqEKIas8QOw7cWfDQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA</ref>

==Royal origin==
As the chronicles are silent on the subject of Malusha's pedigree, 19th-century Russian historians devised various theories to explain her parentage and name.

A prominent chronicle researcher and [[Linguistics|linguist]] [[Alexei Shakhmatov]] considered Malusha to be the daughter of Mstisha Sveneldovich, son of a [[varangian]] [[voevoda]] [[Sveinald (Varangian warlord)|Sveinald]]. He believed that the name Malusha was a [[Slavic languages|slav]]inized version of a [[Scandinavia]]n name Malfried.<ref>http://books.google.com/books?id=_mWnGwX9bRwC&pg=PA155&dq=%22his+mother+Malusha-Malfrida+%E2%80%94+was+a+clairvoyant%22&hl=no&ei=4wwBTpulIYWY8QO28KCRDQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22his%20mother%20Malusha-Malfrida%20%E2%80%94%20was%20a%20clairvoyant%22&f=false</ref> The Primary Chronicle records that a certain Malfried died in 1000. This record follows that of [[Rogneda]]'s death. Since Rogneda was Vladimir's wife, historians assume that Malfried was another close relative of the ruling prince, preferably his wife or mother.

Another Russian historian [[Dmitry Ilovaisky]] came to an opposite conclusion that the Slavic name Malusha was turned into a Scandinavian Malfried. Ukrainian historian [[Mykhailo Hrushevsky]] criticized both of these versions.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} An [[archaeologist]] [[Dmitry Prozorovsky]] believed that Malusha was the daughter of [[Mal (Drevlyan leader)|Mal]], a [[Drevlyans|Drevlyan]] leader.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}
