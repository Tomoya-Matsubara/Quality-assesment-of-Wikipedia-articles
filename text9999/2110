The '''''Winfield Scott''''' was a [[Paddle steamer|sidewheel steamer]] that transported passengers and cargo between [[San Francisco, California]] and [[Panama]] the early 1850s, during the [[California Gold Rush]].  After entering a heavy [[fog]] off the coast of southern California on the evening of [[December 1]], [[1853]], the ship crashed into [[Anacapa Island|Middle Anacapa Island]].  All 450 passengers and crew survived, but the ship was lost.

The ''Winfield Scott'' has been the object of numerous salvage operations since the crash, and currently rests underwater as part of the [[Channel Islands National Park]] and [[Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary|Marine Sanctuary]].  The wreck site of the ''Winfield Scott'' is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

==History==
===California Gold Rush===
The discovery of [[gold]] at [[Sutter's Mill]] in 1848 brought thousands of people to [[California]] in search of fortune until the late 1850s.  Since neither the [[Panama Canal]] nor the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]] had been constructed, people emigrating to California from the [[Eastern United States]] had three main routes of passage.  They could travel over land, which was expensive and dangerous, or they could sail the roughly 14,000-mile route around [[South America]].  This was more attractive to some but no less dangerous, due in part to the rough waters of the [[Drake Passage]].  In addition to the inherent dangers of either route, the journey often took as long as six months to complete.

The third route involved traversing the [[jungle]]s of the [[Isthmus of Panama]], then departing via the southern coast of Panama.  While this cut the length of the sea journey in half, ships to ferry passengers from Panama to San Francisco were not commonplace.  As a result, many had to wait months to complete the second half of their journey.<ref name="journey">[http://www.pbs.org/goldrush/journey.html "The Gold Rush: The Journey"]. PBS.org.  Retrieved June 10, 2006.</ref>  To fill this growing need for swift passage from Panama to California, shipbuilding activities increased dramatically.

===Construction and service===
The ''Winfield Scott'' (originally to be named ''Placer'') was constructed by the [[shipbuilding]] company Westervelt and Mackey of [[New York City|New York]], and was completed in March 1850.  The ship was named for the celebrated [[United States Army]] general [[Winfield Scott]] (the [[stern]] was built with a [[bust (sculpture)|bust]] in his likeness), and it was launched on [[October 22]], [[1850]].  An announcement in the October 20 edition of the ''[[New York Herald]]'' stated that "We understand that no expense has been spared to secure strength, safety and speed..."<ref name="vesselhistory">[http://channelislands.noaa.gov/shipwreck/dbase/cinms/winfieldscott1.html ''Winfield Scott'' Vessel History]. ''Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary''. Retrieved June 8, 2006</ref>

The steamer, owned by Davis, Brooks and Company, initially transported passengers on the New York-[[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]] route.  In 1852, the ship's ownership was transferred to the New York and San Francisco Steamship Company Line, and it arrived in San Francisco on [[April 28]], [[1852]].  Once there, it began taking argonauts<ref name="argonauts">The name used to describe gold seekers during the [[Gold rush]] of the 19th century.</ref> on the Panama Route (between San Francisco and Panama).  After the demise of the New York and San Francisco Steamship Company Line (which had been renamed as the New York and California Steamship Company in May 1853), the ship's ownership was again transferred on [[July 8]], [[1853]], this time to the [[Pacific Mail Steamship Company]].<ref name="vesselhistory">[http://channelislands.noaa.gov/shipwreck/dbase/cinms/winfieldscott1.html ''Winfield Scott'' Vessel History]. ''Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary''. Retrieved June 8, 2006</ref> Its duties, however, did not change after this transfer.

===Last voyage===
[[Image:Anacapamap.gif|left|thumb|275px|Map of Anacapa Island, pinpointing the location where the ''Winfield Scott'' ran aground]]
The ''Winfield Scott'', bound for Panama, departed from San Francisco on the morning of [[December 1]], [[1853]].  In addition to its complement of passengers and crew, the ship was transporting a shipment of [[Precious metal|gold bullion]] worth an estimated US $2 million.<ref name="explore">[http://www.rain.org/campinternet/channelhistory/expedition2/shipwrecks/shipwreckwinfieldscott.html "Winfield Scott Shipwreck"]. ''RAIN.org''. Retrieved June 11, 2006.</ref> The ship's progress was slowed in the afternoon when repairs had to be made to a leaking boiler, but it had resumed course at full speed.

Later that evening, Captain Simon F. Blunt navigated the ship into the [[Santa Barbara Channel]] in an effort to save time.  Captain Blunt knew the channel well, having helped survey the area a few years previous.<ref name="goldrush">[http://www.mms.gov/omm/pacific/kids/goldwrecks.htm "Gold Rush Shipwrecks"]. ''Minerals Management Service''. Retrieved June 9, 2006.</ref>

At approximately 11 PM, the ship encountered a heavy fog, and ran aground into Middle Anacapa Island (approximately 400 miles from port).  Its speed at the time of the wreck was estimated at 10 [[knot (speed)|knots]].  It struck the island [[bow (ship)|bow]] first, and when Capt. Blunt attempted to back away the stern was struck, removing the ship's [[rudder]].  With the ship taking on massive amounts of water and unable to steer, all aboard began scrambling for land.<ref name="goldrush">[http://www.mms.gov/omm/pacific/kids/goldwrecks.htm "Gold Rush Shipwrecks"]. ''Minerals Management Service''. Retrieved June 9, 2006.</ref> The ship was completely evacuated in approximately two hours, and the survivors spent the first night camped on a pinnacle of rock that measured 50 yards long by 25 yards wide.  They next day they moved to a larger piece of land on the island.<ref name="diary">[http://www.riverboatdaves.com/diary/acall.html Diary of Asa Call]. ''From the Diaries of Asa C. Call''. Retrieved June 11, 2006.</ref>   

One of the passengers, Asa Cyrus Call, recalled "a terrible jar and crashing of timbers...I hurried out on deck, where my attention was fixed on a wall of towering cliffs, the tops of which were hidden by the fog and darkness and appeared about to fall and crush us. All round was the loud booming of angry breakers surging about invisible rocks."<ref name="vesselhistory">[http://channelislands.noaa.gov/shipwreck/dbase/cinms/winfieldscott1.html ''Winfield Scott'' Vessel History]. ''Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary''. Retrieved June 9, 2006.</ref> 

On December 2, the steamship ''California'', returning to San Francisco from Panama, was alerted to the presence of the wreck survivors by the smoke of a gun they had fired.<ref name="particulars">[http://www.pt5dome.com/wswreck.htm ''Wreck of the Winfield Scott'']. ''pt5dome.com''. Retrieved June 22, 2006.</ref>   The ''California'' rescued the women and children, as well as the ''Winfield Scott'''s complement of gold bullion.  On December 9, the ''California'' returned to resuce the remaining passengers.<ref name="vesselhistory">[http://channelislands.noaa.gov/shipwreck/dbase/cinms/winfieldscott1.html ''Winfield Scott'' Vessel History]. ''Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary''. Retrieved June 9, 2006.</ref>  The crew stayed behind to recover as much of the mail and passenger luggage as possible.  The ''Winfield Scott'', however, had sustained too much damage and was left in the waters of the channel.

==Wreckage and salvage==
[[Image:Winfield Scott Scatter Map.png|thumb|200px|Scatter map of the wreckage site]]
The remains of the ''Winfield Scott'' are located under 25-30 feet of water in the [[Channel Islands National Park]] and [[Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary|Marine Sanctuary]].  The wreckage site was verified in 1981<ref name="symposium">[http://www.mahhi.org/Abstracts_2005.htm ''2005 Symposium on Maritime Archaeology and History of Hawaii and the Pacific'']. ''Maritime Archaeology and History of the Hawaiian Islands Foundation (MAHHI)''. Retrieved June 24, 2006.</ref> and was registered with the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1988.  The site is protected by California and United States law, which prohibits divers from removing any part of the wreckage.

A [[Marine salvage|salvage]] operation was undertaken in 1894, utilizing the ''San Pedro''.  Much of the iron machinery, as well as hundreds of copper bolts, were recovered.  An additional salvage operation during [[World War II]] recovered additional iron and brass for the [[war effort]].<ref name="CINMS">[http://channelislands.noaa.gov/shipwreck/dbase/cinms/winfieldscott.html The Winfield Scott at the CINMS Shipwreck Database]. ''Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary''. Retrieved June 9, 2006.</ref>

The remaining wreckage is considered important from an historical perspective, as it represents a tangible example of mid-19th century shipbuilding.  Although much of the wooden hull has long since disintegrated, some of the machinery is still relatively intact.<ref name="pdf">http://www.ecu.edu/maritime/Publications/s2s01.pdf "Archaeological Investigation of
the Gold Rush Steamship ''Winfield Scott''". ''Stem to Stern''. Retrieved June 24, 2006.</ref>

Between 1853 and 1980, more than 140 shipwrecks were documented in the Channel Islands National Park Marine Sanctuary.  As of December 2000, twenty sites had been located.  The prevailing currents and weather conditions of the area made it a dangerous place for navigation.<ref name="data2000">[http://www.vims.edu/bridge/channelislands.html "Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary Data Exercise"].

==Legacy==
===Light beacon===
Shortly after the wreck, the [[U.S. National Geodetic Survey|U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey]] recommended that a permanent [[lighthouse]] facility be built on Anacapa Island.  Due to a lack of funding, the installation (an unmanned [[beacon|acetylene beacon]] on a fifty-foot tower) was not constructed until 1912. The tower was replaced by a lighthouse in 1932.<ref name="history">[http://www.west.net/~scifmail/anahist.html "History of Anacapa Island"]. ''Santa Cruz Island Foundation''. Retrieved June 24, 2006.</ref>

===Impact on local ecosystem===
One of the lingering effects of the ''Winfield Scott'''s wreck was the introduction of [[Black Rat|black rat]]s to the local [[ecosystem]] of the [[Channel Islands of California|Channel Islands]].<ref name="rats">[http://www.nps.gov/chis/naturalresources/page5.html "Rats as Introduced Predators"]. ''The National Park Service''. Retrieved June 8, 2006.</ref>  The black rats were a major disruption to the local wildlife on Anacapa Island and are still are a problem on [[San Miguel Island]].  The black rats were successfully eradicated from Anacapa Island by 2003, with a controversial program that involved an aerial application of the [[Rat poison|rodenticide]] brodifacoum, the first such eradication in the United States.  The program cost nearly $1 million US.<ref name="eradication"> Howald, Gregg. R., Faulkner, Kate et al. 2003. ''Eradication of Black Rats From Anacapa Island: Biological and Social Considerations''.
