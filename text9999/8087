'''Clemens Johann Dreisewerd''' [Steamboat] ([[January 24]], [[1916]] - [[September 11]], [[2001]]) was a [[pitcher]] in [[Major League Baseball]] who played for three different teams between [[1944 in baseball|1944]] and [[1948 in baseball|1948]]. Listed at 6' 1.5", 195 lb., Dreisewerd batted and threw [[left handed]]. He was born in [[Old Monroe, Missouri]]. 

During 10 years, Dreisewerd struggled in the [[minor league baseball|minor leagues]] through the adversities and disappointments of baseball's contract system before attaining major league status. At the end of 1937, he decided to write a letter to the [[Baseball commissioner|Baseball Commissioner]] [[Kenesaw Mountain Landis]]. In this letter, Dreisewerd complained about the manner in which he had been moved around to other organizations while under contract with the [[San Francisco Giants|New York Giants]]. On New Year's Day of 1938, Commissioner Landis granted him [[free agent|free agency]]. 

In 1944, while pitching for [[Sacramento Solons|Sacramento]], Dreisewerd turned things around recording 20 [[win (baseball)|wins]] and a 1.61 [[earned run average|ERA]], the lowest of the [[Pacific Coast League]] pitchers. Finally, he reached the majors late in the season with the [[Boston Red Sox]], ending with a 2-4 mark in seven [[starting pitcher|starts]]. After appearing in only two games in 1945, he was recruited by the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] during [[World War II]]. While in the Navy, he pitched for a team that included major leaguers as [[Mickey Owen]], [[Jim Konstanty]] and [[Eddie Yost]]. He was released from the Navy in time for the start of the [[1946 in baseball|1946]] season with Boston.

Dreisewerd enjoyed his most productive season with the 1946 [[American League]] champions Red Sox, when he went 4-1 in 20 [[games pitched]] in [[relief pitcher|relief]], except for one start. He also pitched 1/3 of an [[innings pitched|inning]] in Game 4 of the memorable [[1946 World Series]] between the Red Sox and [[St Louis Cardinals|Cardinals]], retiring [[Enos Slaughter]], who had four hits and needed another to set a Series record. 

In 1947, Dreisewerd was sent down to the Red Sox Class Triple-A associate team in [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], as he led the [[American Association (20th century)|American Association]] pitchers with 18 wins and a 2.15 ERA. After that, he divided his playing time with the [[Baltimore Orioles|St. Louis Browns]] and New York Giants in 1948, his last major league season.

In a four-season career, Dreisewerd posted a 6-8 record with 39 [[strikeout]]s and a 4.54 ERA in 46 appearances, including 10 starts, three [[complete games]], two [[save (sport)|saves]], and 140 2/3 innings pitched.

In October 1948 Dreisewerd tried winter baseball in [[Venezuela]], but after a month, a ''[[coup d'<U+00E9>tat]]'' caused the suspension of the baseball season. A year later he developed severe arm problems, and after unsuccessfully tries with various minor league teams, he was convinced that his baseball career was finished.

Following his playing retirement, Dreisewerd worked as a [[General contractor|construction contractor]], building homes in the [[New Orleans]] area, where he lived for 50 years. By 1999, he was legally blind with [[macular degeneration]]. He died in [[Ocean Springs, Mississippi]] at age 85, of head injuries suffered in a fall while on vacation.
