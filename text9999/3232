[[Monsignor]] '''James Peter Davis''' ([[June 9]], [[1904]]&ndash;[[March 4]], [[1988]]) was an [[United States|American]] [[Archbishop]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. Among his positions, were [[Archbishop of San Juan]] ([[1960]]&ndash;[[1964]]) and [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Santa Fe#Archbishops|Archbishop of Santa Fe]] (1964&ndash;[[1974]]). 

Davis was ordained a [[priest]] in May, [[1929]] in [[Michigan]]. In [[1943]], [[Pope Pius XII]] appointed Davis Bishop of [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]]. In [[1960]], [[Pope John XXIII]] raised the Diocese of San Juan into an ''Archdiocese'', therefore raising Davis into an Archbishop and granting him the title of ''Monsignor''.

During this time, Archbishop Davis entered a political controversy with the then [[Governor of Puerto Rico]], [[Luis Mu<U+00F1>oz Mar<U+00ED>n]]. Davis was against Mu<U+00F1>oz's stands in [[abortion]] and other issues, and therefore, along with other bishops, he created a political party called ''Partido Accion Cristiana'' (''Christian Action Party'' in [[English language|English]]). Davis did not run for any political position but campaigned in favor of the candidates of his party. Mu<U+00F1>oz and his [[Popular Democratic Party]] were able to win the 1960 elections, however, he publicly criticized Archbishop Davis for having defied the [[separation of church and state]].

In [[1964]], [[Pope Paul VI]] appointed the [[Puerto Rican]] Bishop [[Luis Aponte Martinez]] as Archbishop of San Juan. Davis was moved to the archdiocese of [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]], [[New Mexico]].

He resigned as Archbishop of Santa Fe in [[1974]] and retired until his death in [[1988]].
