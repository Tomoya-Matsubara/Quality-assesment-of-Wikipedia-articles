{{Campaignbox Croatian War of Independence}}
The '''1991 siege of Kijevo''' was one of the earliest conflicts in the [[Croatian War of Independence]], where the [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (JNA) led by [[Ratko Mladi<U+0107>]] and the forces of [[SAO Krajina]] under [[Milan Marti<U+0107>]] besieged the [[Croats|Croat]]-inhabited village of [[Kijevo, Croatia|Kijevo]]. The first part of the blockade took place in late April and early May 1991&mdash;lifted after negotiations in the aftermath of [[1991 protest in Split|large protests against the JNA in Split]].

The JNA renewed the blockade in mid-August. Kijevo was captured on August 26, and subsequently looted and torched. The fighting in Kijevo was significant as one of the first instances when the JNA openly sided with the SAO Krajina against Croatian authorities. The [[ethnic cleansing]] of Kijevo was later prosecuted by the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] and Croatian judiciary.

==Background==
{{main|Croatian War of Independence}}

In 1991, Kijevo was a village of 1,261 people, 99.6% [[Croats]], but surrounded by [[Serbs|ethnic Serbian]] villages of [[Pola<U+010D>a, <U+0160>ibenik-Knin County|Pola<U+010D>a]], [[Civljane]] and [[Cetina, Croatia|Cetina]].{{sfn|Gow|2003|p=154}}{{sfn|Silber|Little|1996|p=171}}

The ethnic Serbian villages had become part of the self-proclaimed [[SAO Krajina]] in 1990 through the so-called [[Log Revolution]]. Since August 17, 1990, Kijevo was surrounded by barricaded roads in Pola<U+010D>a and Civljane, and Kijevo's population started to organize an ad hoc militia in response to that; they smuggled weapons through mountain paths while keeping a distance from a nearby newly created outpost of the [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (JNA).{{sfn|Municipality of Kijevo|2007}}

Following the [[Plitvice Lakes incident]] of April 1, 1991, the two militias each captured several prisoners in Civljane and Kijevo.{{sfn|Municipality of Kijevo|2007}} On April 2, JNA intelligence officers reported on this, and warned how local militias in Kijevo and Civljane, otherwise separated by barricades, were engaged in armed skirmishes that threatened to escalate.{{sfn|Hrvatski vojnik|October 2012}}

In the night of April 27-28, a group of [[Croatian Ministry of the Interior]] officers broke through the barricades and arrived in Kijevo.{{sfn|Municipality of Kijevo|2007}} A Croatian police station was formally established in Kijevo on April 28.{{sfn|Degoricija|2008|p=49}} The JNA troops, commanded by the JNA 9th ([[Knin]]) Corps [[chief of staff]] [[Colonel]] [[Ratko Mladi<U+0107>]], moved in to enforce a blockade,{{sfn|Woodward|1995|p=142}} cutting all access and preventing delivery of supplies to Kijevo.{{sfn|Gow|2003|p=154}} The JNA subsequently entered the village in an effort to obstruct the newly created police station.{{sfn|Municipality of Kijevo|2007}} In response to the arrival of JNA tanks and APCs, the civilians in Kijevo formed a human shield to protect the police station building, starting a standoff.{{sfn|Municipality of Kijevo|2007}} On May 2, a Croatian police helicopter managed to land in Kijevo, and the blockade was strengthened in response so as to become impenetrable.{{sfn|Municipality of Kijevo|2007}}

[[Croatian President]] [[Franjo Tu<U+0111>man]] called on the public to bring the siege to its end, and the plea resulted in a [[1991 protest in Split|large-scale protest]] against the JNA in [[Split, Croatia|Split]],{{sfn|Woodward|1995|p=142}} organised by [[Croatian Trade Union Association]] in the [[Brodosplit]] Shipyard on 6 May 1991.{{sfn|Slobodna Dalmacija|6 May 2001}} The siege of Kijevo was lifted days after the protest through negotiations and two weeks after the JNA blockaded the village.{{sfn|Gow|2003|pp=154}}

==August blockade==
The May arrangement proved short-lived, as the JNA units, again led by Mladi<U+0107>, put up barricades to prevent entry into the village on August 17, 1991. The next day, Croatian Serb leader [[Milan Marti<U+0107>]] laid down an ultimatum to the police and inhabitants of Kijevo, asking them to leave the village and its vicinity within two days or face an armed attack.{{sfn|Gow|2003|pp=154-155}}{{sfn|Allcock|Milivojevi<U+0107>|Horton|1998|p=142}}

On August 23&ndash;25, Croatian forces evacuated nearly entire civilian population of the village.{{sfn|ICTY|12 June 2007|pp=61-62}} On August 25, Croatian forces launched a failed attack on JNA barracks in [[Sinj]], {{convert|38|km|abbr=off}} to the southeast of Kijevo. The objective of the attack was to obtain weapons needed as Croatian positions near Kijevo deteriorated.<ref>{{harvnb|Slobodna Dalmacija|25 August 2010}}</ref>

On August 26, the JNA attacked Kijevo, opposed by 58 policemen armed with [[small arms]] only and commanded by police station chief Martin <U+010C>i<U+010D>in <U+0160>ain. Between 05:18 and 13:00, the JNA fired 1,500 artillery shells against the village, and the [[Yugoslav Air Force]] supported the attack with 34 [[close air support]] sorties. The same afternoon, the JNA mounted a ground force assault on Kijevo.{{sfn|Novi list|27 May 2011}} The attacking force consisted of approximately 30 tanks supported by JNA infantry and Croatian Serb militia.{{sfn|Novosti|3 June 2011}}

The JNA entered the village by 16:30.{{sfn|Novi list|27 May 2011}} [[Lieutenant Colonel]] Borislav <U+0110>uki<U+0107>, in command of the Tactical Group-1 tasked with capture of Kijevo and the commanding officer of the JNA 221st Motorised Infantry Brigade, reported that the village was secured by 22:30.{{sfn|JNA|27 August 1991}} The Croatian police fled Kijevo in three groups via [[Veliki Kozjak|Mount Kozjak]] towards [[Drni<U+0161>]].{{sfn|Novi list|27 May 2011}} The remaining Croatian population left after the artillery had destroyed much of their settlements.{{sfn|Gow|2003|p=155}}{{sfn|Silber|Little|1996|pp=171<U+2013>173}} The reporter of [[Radio Television Belgrade]] Vesna Jugovi<U+0107> recorded these events. Krajina units commanded by Marti<U+0107> acted in concert with JNA to take command of the area.{{sfn|Silber|Little|1996|pp=172}}

==Aftermath==
The clash between the Croatian forces and the JNA in Kijevo was one of the first instances where the JNA openly sided with the insurgent Serbs in rapidly escalating [[Croatian War of Independence]].{{sfn|Gow|2003|pp=155}} The defending force suffered only two wounded, but one of the retreating groups was captured.{{sfn|Novi list|27 May 2011}} The group, consisting of 20 men,{{sfn|ICTY|12 June 2007|p=107}} were later released in a [[prisoner of war]] exchange.{{sfn|Novi list|27 May 2011}} The JNA suffered no casualties.{{sfn|JNA|27 August 1991}} After the JNA secured Kijevo, the village was looted and torched.{{sfn|Novosti|3 June 2011}} The destruction of Kijevo became one of the most notorious Serb crimes in the early stages of the war.{{sfn|Hoare|2010|p=122}} The JNA units which took part in the fighting in and around Kijevo advanced towards Sinj in the following few days, capturing [[Vrlika]] before being redeployed to take part in the [[Battle of <U+0160>ibenik]] in mid-September.{{sfn|Novosti|3 June 2011}}

At the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]], the [[trial of Milan Marti<U+0107>]] resulted in a guilty verdict with regard to Marti<U+0107>'s involvement on Kijevo, and the findings of the Trial Chamber in 2007 regarding Kijevo were confirmed by the Appeals Chamber in 2008, based on witness testimonies about it being [[ethnic cleansing]].{{sfn|ICTY|12 June 2007|pp=61-62}} The events at Kijevo were not included in the indictment at the [[trial of Ratko Mladi<U+0107>]], but the Croatian judiciary tried Mladi<U+0107> [[in absentia]] for war crimes committed in Kijevo. He was convicted and sentenced to 20 years in prison.{{sfn|Jutarnji list|26 May 2011}}
