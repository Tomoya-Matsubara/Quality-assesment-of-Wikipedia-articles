[[North London Railway]] (NLR) Crane Tank was a 0-4-2ST steam locomotive [[crane tank]] type.  Originally built in 1858 as a [[Sharp_Stewart_and_Company|Sharp-Stewart]] [[0-4-0ST]], it was rebuilt into an [[0-4-2ST]] with [[steam crane]] carried by the trailing truck in [[1872]].  NLR Number 29A; it was subsequently inherited by the LNWR in [[1908]], who gave it the number 2896, in turn the LMS in [[1923]] (No. 7217, later placed on [[duplicate list]] as 27217), and [[British Railways]] in [[1948]] (BR No. 58865).  It was the oldest locomotive to be inherited by BR.  And when finally withdrawn in [[1951]], it was the oldest surviving standard gauge engine in service with [[British Railways]].  It was scrapped at [[Derby Works]].
