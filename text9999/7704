[[Major (United Kingdom)|Major]] '''Blair Inskip Swannell''' (20 August 1875 <U+2013> 25 April 1915)<ref name="scrum" /> was an [[England|English]]-born international [[rugby union]] forward who played club rugby for [[Northampton Saints|Northampton]]. Swannell played international rugby for the [[British and Irish Lions|British Isles]] on their [[1899 British Lions tour to Australia|1899 tour of Australia]] and [[1904 British Lions tour to Australia and New Zealand|1904 tour of Australia and New Zealand]]; and after settling in [[Australia]], played a single game for the [[Australia national rugby union team|Australian national team]].

During the [[Second Boer War]], Swannell served in the [[British Army]] in [[South Africa]], rising to the rank of [[First Lieutenant|lieutenant]]. During the [[World War I|First World War]] he joined the [[Australian Imperial Force]] and was appointed with the rank of [[major (United Kingdom)|major]], serving with the [[1st Battalion (Australia)|1st Battalion]]. He was killed on 25 April 1915 while taking part in the [[Landing at Anzac Cove]], during the first day of the [[Gallipoli Campaign]].

==Personal history==
Swannell was born in [[Weston Underwood, Buckinghamshire|Weston Underwood]], Buckinghamshire<ref name="westunder">{{cite web | url=http://www.roll-of-honour.com/Buckinghamshire/WestonUnderwood.html | title=Western-Underwood War Memorials | work=roll-of-honour.com | author= | date=1 July 1899 | accessdate=28 August 2010}}</ref> on 20 August 1875 to William and Charlotte Swannell, and was the third child of at least five siblings.<ref name="Census1881">{{cite web | url=http://www.familysearch.org/eng/search/Census/household_record.asp?HOUSEHOLD_CODE=1881BR_1531989&HOUSEHOLD_SUB=1&frompage=99 | title=Household record of William Swannell | work=familysearch.org | author=British Census of 1881 | date= | accessdate=30 August 2010}}</ref> His father was a farmer, who ran a 423-acre farm which employed 17 adults and children.<ref name="Census1881"/> He was home schooled as an infant before beginning his formal education at [[Repton School]].<ref name="Nelson Evening Mail">{{cite web | url=http://newspapers.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/3694804 | title=The English Football Team - A letter from Rev M.

In 1897 he made his first visit to Australia, as a [[shipmate|mate]] on a [[schooner]].<ref name="The Argus">{{cite web | url=http://newspapers.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/1514760 | title=Further Australian casualties at the Dardanelles | work=The Argus, (Melbourne) | author= | date=6 May 1915 | accessdate=31 August 2009}}</ref> On his return to Britain, Swannell joined the [[British Army]] and served in [[South Africa]] during the [[Second Boer War]],<ref>[http://www.colonialrugby.com.au/dual-internationals.htm Required: Football Boots & A Love of Country] colonialrugby.com</ref> where he joined the 35th Battalion (Buckinghamshire) [[Imperial Yeomanry]].

Swannell was a keen self-promoter, claiming a number of exploits that were so abounding, that his adventures were "too numerous to be recorded".<ref name="Fielding Star"/> These claims included: fighting amongst the insurrectionists in [[Uruguay]],<ref name="Fielding Star" /> to have hunted [[seal]] down the South American coast and around [[Cape Horn]]<ref name="The Argus" /> as well as [[Labrador]],<ref name="Fielding Star" /> and to have played rugby in [[France]], [[Germany]], [[South Africa]], [[India]]<ref name="Fielding Star"/> and [[North America|North]] and [[South America]].<ref name="Fielding Star"/><ref name="booth">{{cite news|last=Booth|first=E.

One claim that is problematic, was made by the ''Fielding Star'' newspaper in 1909,<ref name="Fielding Star"/> that he took part in the Cape Frontier war. This cannot be a reference to the [[Xhosa Wars]] as the last of that series of wars ended in 1879, when he was merely the age of four. An article from 1925, claimed he represented Wales and Argentina.<ref name="booth" />

After touring Australia with the British Isles team for the second time in 1904, he settled in [[Sydney]]. A keen all-round sportsman he coached not only rugby but also [[field hockey|hockey]], was vice-president of the Sydney Swimming Club,<ref name="The Argus"/> and training senior military cadets for [[Surf lifesaving|surf life-saving]] examinations.<ref>{{cite news|title=Royal Life-Saving Society.|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article28135192|accessdate=1 September 2010|newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald|date=2 March 1912|page=8}}</ref> He also joined the [[Australian Militia]], and by 1914 had reached the rank of [[captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|captain]] and had passed the promotion exams for the rank of major.<ref name=servicerecord>{{cite web|url=http://naa12.naa.gov.au/scripts/imagine.asp?B=8096469&I=1&SE=1|title=Service record of Blair Inskip Swannell|publisher=[[National Archives of Australia]]|accessdate=1 September 2009}}</ref>

==Rugby career==
Swannell, a forward who played specifically as [[Rugby union positions#8. Number eight|number 8]] in one Test,<ref name="scrum2" /> was an unconventional and hard rugby player, known for his violent play.<ref name="CWGC"/><ref name="lateswannell">{{cite news|title=Rugby: The Late B.

Swannell first came to note as a rugby player when he represented English club team [[Northampton Saints|Northampton]].<ref name="CWGC" /> It was while with Northampton that Swanell was invited to tour with [[Matthew Mullineux]]'s British Isles team,<ref name="Nelson Evening Mail" /> on their [[1899 British Lions tour to Australia|1899 tour of Australia]]. Swanell played in 17 matches of the tour including three of the four Tests against the Australian national team, missing only the opening defeat.<ref name="scrum2" /><ref name="Lions">{{cite web|title=Blair Swannell - Lions profile|url=http://www.lionsrugby.com/6012.php?player=74379&includeref=dynamic|works=lionsrugby.com|accessdate=31 August 2010}}</ref> Swannell scored in only one game on the tour, a [[try]] in a win over the [[New South Wales Waratahs]] on 29 July 1899.<ref>{{cite web|title=NSW Waratahs 5 v 11 British & Irish Lions|url=http://www.lionsrugby.com/thetour/593.php?section=report&fixid=62221\works=lionsrugby.com|accessdate=31 August 2010}}</ref>

[[File:1904 Lions in NZ.jpg|250px|thumb|left|1904 British Isles team, Swannell is back row, second left]]
Swannell returned to Britain with the touring team, and was reselected for the [[1904 British Lions tour to Australia and New Zealand|1904 tour]], this time taking in Australia and [[New Zealand]]. Swannell played in 15 games, including all four Test Matches, three against Australia and the final Test against [[New Zealand national rugby union team|New Zealand]].<ref name="Lions" /> In the third Test, Swannell scored his first and only international points, a try against Australia in Sydney. The British Isles were victorious over the Australians, but lost the New Zealand match, this was the first international game that Swannell had been on the losing side.<ref name="scrum2" /> In the New Zealand clash, Swannell's violent playing style, was targeted by countering with equally rough play. He left the field at the end of the match with two black eyes, and bleeding, but with his spirit undaunted.<ref name="lateswannell" /><ref>{{cite news|title=Football: Notes by Full Back|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&d=OW19090331.2.409|accessdate=31 August 2010|issue=2872|newspaper=Otago Witness|date=31 March 1909|page=61}}</ref>

When the touring British team returned home after the 1904 campaign, Swannell along with team-mates [[David Bedell-Sivright]], and Dr. Sidney Crowther<ref>{{cite news|title=Notes By Full Back.|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&d=OW19050419.2.125.1|accessdate=31 August 2010|newspaper=Otago WWitness|issue=2666|date=19 April 1905|page=60}}</ref> decided to remain in Australia, to begin a new life. He joined club team [[Northern Suburbs Rugby Club|Northern Suburbs]],<ref>[http://www.northsrugby.com.au/default.asp?id=19 Honour Board] Northern Suburbs Rugby Club</ref> based in Sydney. In 1905 he was selected to play for the Australian national team, even though he had already faced them as an opponent on six occasions. The match was against New Zealand, and was the first overseas tour the Australians had undertaken; Australia lost 14<U+2013>3.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.scrum.com/statsguru/rugby/match/19078.html | title=Australia tour - Dunedin, 2 September 1905 | work=scrum.com | author= | date= | accessdate=30 August 2010}}</ref>

With his playing career behind him, Swannell continued his involvement with the sport by coaching at youth and school level, namely at [[St. Joseph's College, Hunters Hill|St Joseph's College]] where he coached the team to a number of championships.<ref name="heroes" /> He was an advocate for team training and in particular for forwards to rehearse scrummaging and break-down techniques.<ref name="valueforward" /> He argued that the forwards won or lost the game.<ref name="valueforward">{{cite news|title=Value of Forward Play.|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article15045876|accessdate=31 August 2010|newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald|date=26 March 1909|page=10}}</ref>  In 1909, he became Secretary of the Metropolitan Rugby Union,<ref name="Fielding Star"/> and in 1910 the club raised his salary from <U+00A3>200 to <U+00A3>250.<ref>{{cite news|title=General Gossip.|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&d=NZTR19100402.2.13.2|accessdate=31 August 2010|newspaper=NZ Truth|issue= 249|date=2 April 1910|page=3}}</ref> Financial stress on the club lead him to resign in 1911<ref>{{cite news|title=In Financial Straits.|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&d=EP19110106.2.47|accessdate=31 August 2010|newspaper=Evening Post|volume= LXXXI |issue=4|date=6 January 1911|page=7}}</ref> to save expense, but he continued in an 'honorary position'.<ref name="turncold">{{cite news|title=Turned Down Cold|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&d=EP19140711.2.105|accessdate=31 August 2010|newspaper=Evening Post|volume= LXXXVIII |issue=10|date=11 July 1914|page=14}}</ref> He also served as a referee from 1911<ref>{{cite news|title=Rugby Union: Third Grade Final|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article15273302|accessdate=31 August 2010|newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald|date=11 September 191|page=6}}</ref> to 1914,<ref name="turncold" /> earning praise for his ability to control the game.<ref>{{cite news|title=Football.

While in Australia, Swannell was often approached by the sporting press for his opinion on rugby matters. Particularly on clashes between British and Antipodean teams, including the [[The Original All Blacks|1905 New Zealand tour]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&d=WCT19051031.2.10 | title=Topics of the Day | work=West Coast Times | author= | date=31 October 1905 | accessdate=24 august 2010}}</ref> He was vocal in his support for maintaining the amateur nature of rugby,<ref>{{cite book|last=Collins|first=Tony|title=Rugby's great split: class, culture, and the origins of Rugby League football|year=1998|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-7146-4867-1|pages=304|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Dfyovsrc2OsC&lpg=PA217&pg=PA217#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=1 September 2010|page=217|language=English}}</ref> but did not side with Bedell-Sivright in denying that a stipend had been paid during the 1904 tour.<ref>{{cite news|title=Football: Notes by Full Back|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&d=OW19090317.2.290|accessdate=1 September 2010|issue= 2870 |newspaper=Otago Witness|date=17 March 1909|page=57}}</ref> In 1908 he was also hired to write a series of articles for the ''Star'' on the topic of forward play, and scrummaging.<ref>{{cite news|title=Advertisement: Scrum Formation and Forward play|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article14944305|accessdate=31 August 2010|newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald|date=11 April 1908|page=3}}</ref>
