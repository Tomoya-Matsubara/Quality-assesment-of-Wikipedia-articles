Following No Doubt's hiatus, Stefani sought out her bandmate Tony Kanal to discuss the possibility of a solo career. The idea was to make a quick dance record, but this became a large collaboration with other artists, producers and various non-ska influences.

Stefani's debut solo album ''[[Love. Angel. Music. Baby.]]'' was released in November 2004. The album features a large number of collaborations with producers and other artists, including [[Tony Kanal]], [[Linda Perry]], [[Andr<U+00E9> 3000]], [[Nellee Hooper]], [[The Neptunes]] and [[New Order]]. Stefani created the album to modernize the music to which she listened when in high school, and ''L.A.M.B.'' takes influence from a variety of music styles of the 1980s and early 1990s such as new wave and [[electro music|electro]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Vineyard |first=Jennifer |url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/s/stefani_gwen/news_feature_112204/ |title=Gwen Stefani: Scared Solo |publisher=[[MTV]] |accessdate=April 23, 2007}}</ref> Stefani's decision to use her solo career as an opportunity to delve further into pop music instead of trying "to convince the world of [her] talent, depth and artistic worth" was considered unusual.<ref name="nme"/> As a result, reviews of the album were mixed, and it was described as "fun as hell but [...] not exactly rife with [[subversion|subversive]] social commentary."<ref>{{cite web |last=Cinquemani |first=Sal |url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/music/review/gwen-stefani-love-angel-music-baby/519 |title=Gwen Stefani: Love.
