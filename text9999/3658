The next year, with Mandy Patinkin, she was featured on the album entitled "Kidults".<ref name=Kristinofficial/>  Also in 2001, she released her debut album ''[[Let Yourself Go (Kristin Chenoweth album)|Let Yourself Go]]'', which was a collection of standards from the musicals of the 1930s.  One of the tracks featured a duet with [[Jason Alexander]].  In October 2002, Chenoweth performed songs from her solo album, ''[[Let Yourself Go (Kristin Chenoweth album)|Let Yourself Go]]'', in concert for [[Lincoln Center]]'s American Songbook concert series.<ref>Holden, Stephen. [http://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/14/arts/pop-review-a-glamorous-chameleon-catching-all-the-nuances.html?scp=2&sq=%22Kristin+Chenoweth%22&st=nyt "A Glamorous Chameleon, Catching All the Nuances"]. ''The New York Times'', October 14, 2002</ref>  The same year, she appeared as [[Fanny Brice]] in the Actor's Fund Benefit Concert of the musical ''[[Funny Girl (musical)|Funny Girl]]'' in New York City.  In 2003 in London, she performed a solo concert as part of the ''Divas at Donmar'' series for director [[Sam Mendes]].  Later that year, she sang Glinda in the cast recording of ''Wicked'' and the soundrack recording of Disney's ''The Music Man''.  In 2004, she released her second album ''[[As I Am (Kristin Chenoweth album)|As I Am]]'', which was a Christian music album containing various spiritual songs. The album peaked at number 31 on the U.S. Christian Albums Chart.  The same year, Chenoweth gave a concert at [[Carnegie Hall]].<ref name=Kristinofficial/>

On January 19, 2007, Chenoweth performed a solo concert at [[The Metropolitan Opera]] in New York, only the third musical theatre star ever to present a solo concert at that location, following [[Barbara Cook]] and [[Yves Montand]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metoperafamily.org/metopera/season/production.aspx?id=9186|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080213121741/http://www.metoperafamily.org/metopera/season/production.aspx?id=9186|date=2008-02-13 |archivedate=2008-02-13|title=Kristin Chenoweth: Live at the Met |accessdate=May 22, 2007}}</ref>  The same year, she was featured in songs with [[Nathan Gunn]] on an album entitled ''Just Before Sunrise''.  The next year, she released her third solo studio album, entitled ''[[A Lovely Way to Spend Christmas]]''.  The album was much anticipated by both her fans and Chenoweth herself; she had expressed her desire in the past to produce a Christmas album. The album included a duet with [[John Pizzarelli]] and there are several modern holiday tunes, but many traditional carols as well including ''[[The Lord's Prayer]]''.  This album has been her best seller, reaching number 77 on the U.S. Billboard Albums Chart, climbing to number 7 on the U.S. Holiday Albums chart and to number 1 on the U.S. Heatseekers Chart.  Among many other solo concerts around the U.S., Chenoweth performed her own concert in 2009 with the [[St. Louis Symphony Orchestra]], at the [[Fox Theatre (St. Louis, Missouri)|Fox Theatre]].<ref>[http://www.broadwayworld.com/article/Kristin_Chenoweth_Appears_with_St_Louis_Symphony_Orchestra_at_Fox_Theatre_Jan_10_20090106 "Kristin Chenoweth Appears with St. Louis Symphony Orchestra at Fox Theatre Jan. 10"].

==Special events and appearances==
Chenoweth and the cast of the Broadway musical ''Wicked'' performed the song "One Short Day" in the 2003 [[Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/82537-Wicked-and-Boy-From-Oz-Featured-on-Macys-Thanksgiving-Day-Parade |work=Playbill.com |title=''Wicked'' and ''Boy From Oz'' Featured on Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade}}</ref>

In the 2005 Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, Chenoweth performed the song "Oklahoma" while riding aboard the "Oklahoma Rising" float. The float was making the first of three annual appearances commemorating the state of Oklahoma's statehood centennial in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://okc.about.com/od/attractionsandevents/a/oklahomamacy.htm |title=Oklahoma in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade |work=About.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ok.gov/newsroom.php?page_id=4936&type=1 |title=OK Centennial to be Featured in Thanksgiving Macy's Parade |work=State of Oklahoma press release |date=November 18, 2006}}</ref>

She was the star performer of the opening ceremony of the 2007 Tournament of Roses Parade.

In the 2008 Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, she performed the song "The Christmas Waltz" from her "A Lovely Way to Spend Christmas" album while riding aboard the "The Care Bears Winter Fun-Derland" float.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.macys.com/campaign/parade/parade.jsp |title=Macy's}}</ref>

==Personal life==
In 2009, Chenoweth wrote a memoir entitled ''A Little Bit Wicked: Life, Love, and Faith in Stages'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/1416580557 |work=Amazon.com |title=A Little Bit Wicked: Life, Love, and Faith in Stages}}</ref> describing her adoption, her turn in ''Wicked'' and her time in Hollywood. She has stated that the book is not a "tell all", and instead focuses on "how I got where I am so far".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theatermania.com/new-york/news/04-2008/kristin-kristin-everywhere_13659.html |work=TheaterMania |date=April 25, 2008 |title=Kristin, Kristin, Everywhere}}</ref> The book was released on April 14, 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/119183-Chenoweths-Autobiography-A-Little-Bit-Wicked-Due-in-April-2009 |title=Chenoweth's Autobiography, ''A Little Bit Wicked'', Due in April 2009}}</ref> The book spent two weeks on [[The New York Times Best Seller List]].

Chenoweth has spoken publicly about her faith; she describes herself as a "non-judgmental, liberal Christian".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/10/fashion/10nite.html?ex=1149048000&en=1c327886d7ea4cf2&ei=5070 |work=The New York Times |title=Fashion & Style "A Night Out With: Kristin Chenoweth: Head Shots" | first=Pauline | last=O'Connor | date=April 10, 2005 | accessdate=May 7, 2010}}</ref> Raised as a [[Southern Baptist Convention|Southern Baptist]], she later chose to have a personal connection to a faith that is not based in any one denomination.  When in [[California]], she attends a non-denominational church in [[Malibu, California|Malibu]]; in New York, she attends a [[United Methodist]] Church.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

Chenoweth has a large [[homosexuality|gay]] fanbase, and was uninvited from a ''[[Women of Faith]]'' conference in September 2005. According to ''The New York Times'', "when she assured her theater fans that she supports gay rights her Christian base was outraged."<ref>Green, Jesse.[http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/03/theater/03Gree.html She Sings! She Acts!

To promote the album, she made an appearance on ''[[The 700 Club]]'' that upset some of her gay fans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.feministing.com/archives/021125.html |work=Feministing|title=Kristin Kristin Chenoweth slams homophobic Newsweek article|date=2010-05-10}}</ref><ref name=NPR2009/>  She later said she thought that the "[[Pat Robertson]]s and [[Jerry Falwell]]s of the world are scary" and that she regretted appearing on the show.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kristincanada.com/library/magazines.php|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080302113916/http://www.kristincanada.com/library/magazines.php|archivedate=2008-03-02 |title=The Kristin Library}}</ref>

She has dated producer/writer [[Aaron Sorkin]].<ref>[http://www.pbs.org/kcet/tavissmiley/archive/200904/20090429_chenoweth.html Transcript, Tavis Smiley interview, airdate April 29, 2009] pbs.org, April 29, 2009</ref> In Sorkin's ''[[Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip]]'', the character of [[Harriet Hayes]] bears significant resemblances to Chenoweth, and the relationship between the Christian Hayes and "East Coast liberal Jewish atheist" (her description) [[Matt Albie]] is modeled after that of Chenoweth and Sorkin.  For example, Chenoweth's decision to appear on ''The 700 Club'' and her falling out with Women of Faith were depicted with the Hayes character.<ref>{{cite news|title=''West Wing'' to West Coast: TV's Auteur Portrays TV |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/11/arts/television/11sork.html |last=Carter |first=Bill |accessdate=October 25, 2006 |date=September 11, 2006 |work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref><ref name=NPR2009/>

Chenoweth has [[M<U+00E9>ni<U+00E8>re's disease]], an inner-ear disorder that can cause vertigo, headaches and nausea, among other symptoms.  She has said that, during some performances, she has had to lean on her co-stars to keep her balance and that it has caused her to miss performances.<ref name=NPR2009/> Chenoweth was awarded an honorary doctorate in Performing Arts from the [[University of North Carolina School of the Arts]] on May 30, 2009, where she was the commencement speaker.<ref>[http://www.uncsa.edu/pressreleases/Releases2009/May09/COMMENCEMENTSPEAKERS09.htm "Film, TV and Broadway Star Kristin Chenoweth To Deliver University Commencement Address At UNCSA"], [[University of North Carolina School of the Arts]] press release, May 22, 2009 . Retrieved March 7, 2010.</ref>

In May 2010, Chenoweth wrote in response to [[Newsweek gay actor controversy|an article in ''Newsweek]]'' by [[Ramin Setoodeh]], an openly gay writer.  Setoodeh thought that her Tony-nominated ''Promises, Promises'' co-star, Sean Hayes, "comes off as wooden and insincere" in playing the straight character Chuck, and that [[Jonathan Groff]] has a similar credibility problem in the TV show ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]''.  He questioned whether any openly gay actor could acceptably portray a straight character.<ref>Setoodeh, Ramin. [http://www.newsweek.com/2010/04/30/straight-jacket.html "Straight Jacket"]. ''Newsweek'', May 2010</ref>  Chenoweth called the article "horrendously homophobic" and criticized Setoodeh's view as rationalizing "the same kind of bullying" that gay youths face in high school.  Chenoweth argued that audiences "come to the theater to go on a journey" and do not care about an actor's sexual orientation.<ref>[http://www.autostraddle.com/chenoweth-defends-gay-actors-44570 "Kristen Chenoweth Stands Up for Gay Actors, Calls Out Homophobic ''Newsweek'' Article"].  Autostraddle.com, accessed May 9, 2010</ref>  The story was picked up approvingly by major media including ''The New York Times''<ref>Itzkoff, Dave. [http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/11/theater/11arts-KRISTINCHENO_BRF.html "Kristin Chenoweth Has Some Words for Newsweek"].
