'''Charles Morgan Herbert Atherton''' (November 19, 1874 <U+2013> December 19, 1934) was a [[Major League Baseball]] [[third baseman]].

Atherton was also an early professional [[American football|football]] player and coach for the [[Greensburg Athletic Association]]. He also played professional football in 1896 for the [[Pittsburgh Athletic Club (football)|Pittsburgh Athletic Club]]. Charles attended [[Penn State University]] and was the son of the university's president, [[George W. Atherton]].
