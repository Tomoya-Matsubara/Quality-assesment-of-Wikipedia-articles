'''Mack Ray Edwards''' ([[1918]]-[[1971]]) was an [[United States|American]] [[serial killer]]. He murdered at least six children in [[Los Angeles County]] between 1953 and 1970.

==Biography==
<p>Mack Ray Edwards was born in [[Arkansas]]. He moved to Los Angeles County in 1941. As a heavy equipment operator contracted by [[Caltrans]], he worked on freeways. The body of one of his victims was found underneath the [[Santa Ana Freeway]], and he claimed to have disposed another of his victims under the [[Ventura Freeway]].

<p>Edwards killed three children from 1953 to 1956, and three more in 1968 and 1969. In 1970, Edwards and a teenage male accomplice kidnapped three girls from their home in [[Sylmar]]. When the girls escaped, Edwards surrendered to police and confessed to [[child molestation|molesting]] and murdering six children.

After three bodies were recovered, Edwards pleaded guilty to three counts of murder and was [[capital punishment|sentenced to death]].<ref>Haynes, Roy. "Death Penalty Voted for Slayer of Six Children." ''Los Angeles Times'', 23 May 1970.</ref> 
<p>
On [[October 30]], [[1971]], following two unsuccessful attempts, Edwards committed [[suicide]] by [[hanging|hanging himself]] with a television cord in his cell in [[San Quentin]].<ref>Stingley, Jim. "Slayer of Six Children Hangs Himself in Cell." ''Los Angeles Times'', 31 Oct. 1971.</ref>

==Victims==
===Known Victims===
Edwards was convicted of the murders of three children:
*Stella Darlene Nolan, age 8, of [[Compton]], who disappeared [[June 20]], [[1953]].
*Gary Rochet, age 16, of [[Granada Hills]], who was found after having been shot to death on [[November 26]], [[1968]].
*Donald Allen Todd, age 13, of [[Pacoima]], who disappeared [[May 16]], [[1969]].

Edwards confessed to three additional killings. Because the bodies of the victims were not recovered, he was never officially charged with these murders:
*Don Baker, 13, and Brenda Howell, age 11, of [[Azusa]], who disappeared [[August 6]], [[1956]]. Howell was Edwards' sister-in-law.
*Roger Madison, 16, of Sylmar, disappeared [[December 16]], [[1968]].<ref>Stingley, Jim. "Slayer of Six Children Hangs Himself in Cell." ''Los Angeles Times'', 31 Oct. 1971.</ref>

===Possible Victims===
<p>Edwards may have committed other murders, but his own account was inconsistent: while in prison he claimed to have killed 18 children,

Accessed 21 March 2007.</ref> but in an interview with the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' he said the number was only six.<ref>Haynes, Roy. "Death Penalty Voted for Slayer of Six Children." ''Los Angeles Times'', 23 May 1970.</ref> The 12-year span between Baker's and Howell's  disappearances and Rochet's shooting has led investigators to suspect Edwards may have claimed more victims in between.

As of March 2007, the [[Los Angeles Police Department]] is investigating the possibility of Edwards' involvement in the disappearance of Tommy Bowman, 8, of [[Redondo Beach]], who disappeared in [[Pasadena]] on [[March 23]], [[1957]]. Author Weston DeWalt was researching the Bowman disappearance when he noticed the similarity between a photo of Edwards and a sketch of Bowman's abductor. DeWalt was later shown a letter from Edwards to his wife in which Edwards states that he "left out" Tommy Bowman from his confession to police.<ref>Blankstein, Andrew.

<p>Edwards is also considered a suspect in the disappearances of Bruce Kremen of [[Granada Hills]] and Karen Lynn Tompkins and Dorothy Gale Brown of [[Torrance]]. Kremen, 6, disappeared from a [[YMCA]] camp in [[Angeles National Forest]] on [[July 12]], [[1960]].<ref> [http://www.charleyproject.org/cases/k/kremen_bruce.html The Charley Project: Bruce Kremen] Accessed 29 March, 2007.</ref> Tompkins, 11, disappeared on [[August 18]], [[1961]]. Brown, also 11, disappeared on [[July 3]], [[1962]]. She had been molested and drowned. Her body was recovered from the ocean off of [[Marina Del Rey]].<ref>[http://www.charleyproject.org/cases/t/tompkins_karen.html The Charley Project: Karen Lynn Tompkins]</ref>
