'''Ronald "Ron" Swanson''' is a [[fictional character]] played by [[Nick Offerman]], in the American comedy television series ''[[Parks and Recreation]]'' on [[NBC]]. Ron is parks department director in the fictional [[Indiana]] city of Pawnee and the immediate superior of protagonist [[Leslie Knope]] ([[Amy Poehler]]). Despite holding a government job, Ron is a staunch [[Libertarianism|Libertarian]] who believes in as little government as possible and feels the parks department should not even run or maintain parks.

Ron, who has an extremely [[deadpan]] and masculine personality, actively works to make city hall less effective and despises interacting with the public. He loves meat, hunting and breakfast foods. He hates and fears his two ex-wives, both of whom are named [[Characters of Parks and Recreation#Tammy Swanson|Tammy]], one of whom is played by Offerman's real-life wife, [[Megan Mullally]]. Ron claims not to be interested in the personal lives of those around him but actually cares a great deal about his colleagues, and has a particularly strong respect for Leslie.

Conceived by series creators [[Michael Schur]] and [[Greg Daniels]], Ron has been one of the main characters since the [[Pilot (Parks and Recreation)|pilot episode]] of ''Parks and Recreation''. Offerman had some input into the character's creation, and some aspects of Ron's personality were inspired by the actor, like his affinity for [[woodworking]]. The traits of the character were partially inspired by a real-life Libertarian elected official in [[Burbank, California|Burbank]], as well as political appointees of [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]].

Ron Swanson has received very positive reviews from critics, has developed a [[cult following]] and is widely considered the [[breakout character]] of the series. Schur has called Ron "our cast [[Most Valuable Player|MVP]]." He has been described by some critics as one of the best characters in a situation comedy in decades, with many comparing his comedic importance to the show to [[Cosmo Kramer]], despite the two characters having extremely different personalities. His platonic relationship with Leslie has been compared to that of [[Mary Richards]] and [[Lou Grant]] in ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]''. Offerman has received several award nominations for the role, and won the [[TCA Award for Individual Achievement in Comedy]], tying with [[Ty Burrell]] of ''[[Modern Family]]''.

==Storyline==
===Season one===
Ron Swanson made his first appearance in the [[Pilot (Parks and Recreation)|pilot episode]] of ''Parks and Recreation'', where he repeatedly denies Leslie's requests to pursue turning a construction pit into a park because he does not believe the parks department should build parks at all. He agrees to green-light the project only when city planner [[Mark Brendanawicz]] ([[Paul Schneider (actor)|Paul Schneider]]) secretly cashes in an unspecified favor in exchange for the approval.<ref>{{cite news |last=Brown |first=Brigid |publisher=[[Cinema Blend]] |date=April 10, 2009 |url=http://www.cinemablend.com/celebrity/TV-Recap-Parks-And-Recreation-Pilot-16789.html |title=TV Recap: Parks and Recreation - Pilot |accessdate=February 23, 2010 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5ujuew8zI |archivedate=December 4, 2010}}</ref> In a deleted scene from the episode "[[Canvassing (Parks and Recreation)|Canvassing]]", Ron tries to leave government employment for a previously-offered job at an [[Internet]] flower company. However, when he finds that business is now doing extremely poorly, Ron sadly realizes he will be in his government job for a long time.<ref>{{Cite video|title  =Parks & Recreation: Season One |medium  =Film (DVD)|publisher=[[Universal Studios Home Entertainment]]|time=Deleted Scenes: Canvassing}}</ref> In the episode "[[Boys' Club (Parks and Recreation)|Boys' Club]]", Ron attends a disciplinary hearing with Leslie after she gets in trouble when the underage [[April Ludgate]] ([[Aubrey Plaza]]) is seen drinking alcohol on a video on the Pawnee website. Ron interrupts half-way through the review, defends Leslie and angrily berates the panel for aggressively questioning her. Although Ron claims he did it only due to his hatred for bureaucratic procedures, it is alluded that he really did so out of respect for Leslie.<ref name="Fowler0501">{{cite news |last=Fowler |first=Matt |title=Parks and Recreation: "Boys' Club" Review |publisher=[[IGN]] |date=May 1, 2009 |url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/978/978748p1.html |accessdate=May 6, 2009 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5vM1SNVEb |archivedate=December 29, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite video | people=[[Michael Schur|Schur, Michael]]|date=2009|title=Parks and Recreation: Season One: "Boys' Club" |format=Audio commentary |medium=DVD|publisher=[[Universal Studios Home Entertainment]]}}</ref>

Ron's second ex-wife, Pawnee library director [[Characters of Parks and Recreation#Tammy Swanson|Tammy]] ([[Megan Mullally]]), appeared in the episode "[[Ron and Tammy]]", where Tammy tricks Leslie into arranging a reunion meeting with Ron under the guise of wishing to work out her differences with him. In fact, Tammy schemed to get Ron to give her the rights to land Leslie plans to turn into a park, so Tammy can build a library branch there instead. During their meeting, Ron and Tammy start loudly arguing, but eventually have passionate sex and get back together. Unable to resist Tammy's charms, Ron asks Leslie to break up with Tammy for him. When Leslie stands up to Tammy in Ron's defense, he is moved by what he describes as the first time any woman has put his needs before her own, and it gives him the strength to finally break up with Tammy.<ref name="Heisler1105">{{cite news |last=Heisler |first=Steve |publisher=[[The A.V.

In "[[Hunting Trip]]", Leslie insists that Ron take her and the other female parks department employees on one of his private hunting expeditions at the park ranger cabin. Ron begrudgingly agrees, but is frustrated to learn that Leslie is in fact an excellent hunter who overshadows his own abilities. During this trip, Ron is shot in the back of a head by a stray bullet and, although it is not fatal, he becomes hallucinatory and furious after taking multiple painkillers. He initially accuses Leslie of shooting him based on her desire to prove herself, but later learns it was Tom and that Leslie took the blame because Tom was not licensed and could have been arrested for hunting.

In "[[The Set Up (Parks and Recreation)|The Set Up]]", a new city-wide effort is implemented to make government officials more accessible to Pawnee residents, an idea which Ron condemns as "my hell".

Ron learns in the third season finale, "[[Li'l Sebastian]]", that Leslie and Ben are secretly having an affair despite Chris' ban on workplace romances, and he warns them they are risking a political scandal that could cost them their jobs. Later, at the funeral of Pawnee's celebrity [[miniature horse]] Li'l Sebastian, Ron is nearly killed as a result of Leslie and Ben's affair. When their efforts to hide their relationship accidentally cause Li'l Sebastian's [[eternal flame]] to be filled with lighter fluid instead of propane, Ron creates a massive fireball when he lights it, which burns off his eyebrows and part of his mustache. The season ends as a horrified Ron learns that his first ex-wife, Tammy, has arrived to see him; the news is enough to make his second ex-wife, also named Tammy, run away in horror.<ref name="Kandell0520">{{cite news |last=Kandell |first=Steve |title=''Parks and Recreation'' Recap: The Champion of Death |work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |date=May 20, 2011 |url=http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2011/05/parks_and_recreation_recap_the_5.html |accessdate=May 30, 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5zcFB3Zcs |archivedate=June 21, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Gilbert |first=Megan |title=Parks and Recreation recap: <U+201C>Li<U+2019>l Sebastian<U+201D> (season finale, part 1) |work=[[Punchline Magazine]] |date=May 20, 2011 |url=http://punchlinemagazine.com/blog/2011/05/parks-and-recreation-recap-%E2%80%9Clil-sebastian%E2%80%9D-season-finale |accessdate=May 30, 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6070VcfBZ |archivedate=July 11, 2011}}</ref>

Ron Swanson was created by ''Parks and Recreation'' creators [[Greg Daniels]] and [[Michael Schur]], although Nick Offerman himself had some input into the character's creation.<ref name="GQRon" /><ref name="Trolio0429" /> The character's traits were partially inspired by a real-life Libertarian elected official that ''Parks and Recreation'' co-creator [[Michael Schur]] encountered in [[Burbank, California|Burbank]] while researching for the show, who favored as little government interference as possible and admitted, "I don't really believe in the mission of my job. ...

Bush]] who were perceived to be opposed to the branch of government they were overseeing.<ref name="Martin1118" /> Ron's signature mustache was one of the first ideas conceived for the character.<ref name="GQRon" /><ref name="Trolio0429" /> Offerman said the deadpan style of humor he uses for Ron Swanson was cultivated during his youth, when he was an [[altar server|altar boy]]: "I would read things with the utmost sincerity, and my cousin would be cracking up because he knew I was full of shit."<ref name="GQRon" />

Many aspects of Ron's character are based on those of Nick Offerman in real life, such as his woodworking abilities;<ref name="SchurInt0324" /><ref name="Martin1118">{{Cite news |last=Martin |first=Denise |title=Making bureaucracy work: How NBC's "Parks and Recreation" overcame bad buzz |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=November 18, 2009 |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2009/11/parks-and-recreation.html |accessdate=December 6, 2009 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uFR0tSJe |archivedate=November 14, 2010}}</ref> Offerman runs an independent carpentry business called Offerman Woodshop.<ref name="GQRon" /><ref>{{Cite web |publisher=Offerman Workshop |last=Offerman |first=Nick |authorlink=Nick Offerman |title=Offerman Woodshop |url=http://offermanwoodshop.com/ |accessdate=February 6, 2010 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5wMPPhcNH |archivedate=February 8, 2011}}</ref> Offerman also plays saxophone in real life, just as Ron does, although the ''Parks and Recreation'' writers did not know this when they wrote this element of his character. Offerman's real-life training in [[stage combat]] and [[Kabuki]] dance were the partial inspiration for self-defense classes Ron offered his parks department colleagues in "[[Park Safety]]".<ref name="Trolio0429" /> Ron's second ex-wife Tammy, who first appeared in the episode "Ron and Tammy", was played by comedienne and actress Megan Mullally, Offerman's real-life wife.<ref name="GQRon" /><ref name="Heisler1105" /><ref name="Martin1118" /> The idea of Ron hating his ex-wife Tammy was established early in the creation of the character, and it was Schur who conceived the idea of casting Mullally, which Offerman was extremely responsive to the idea.<ref name="GQRon" />

Ron became more heavily involved in ''Parks and Recreation'' storylines during the second season, and Offerman largely credited Schur with the development of the character.<ref name="GQRon" /> Schur has described Offerman as a "once-in-a-generation comedic performer",<ref name="Keller0520" /> and "our cast [[Most Valuable Player|MVP]], and in many ways our cast leader".<ref name="Slezak0714">{{cite web |last=Slezak |first=Michael |title=Emmy Nominees Flummoxed by Snub of Parks and Recreation's Nick Offerman |publisher=[[TVLine]] |date=July 14, 2011 |url=http://www.tvline.com/2011/07/nick-offerman-parks-and-recreation-emmy-snub-amy-poehler/ |accessdate=July 14, 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/60BFB9jcH |archivedate=July 14, 2011}}</ref> He compared Ron to a "19th-century rugged individualist", and said of creating the character, "A lot of the credit has to go to Nick Offerman. In real life, he's an incredibly interesting guy, and at the very least, it's much easier to play an interesting guy when you're an interesting guy."<ref name="SchurInt0324" /> Offerman said his own sense of humor fuels much of the character, along with those of Schur, Greg Daniels and the writing staff; he added: "I never dreamed that I could prosper with my perverse sense of humor on a network show."<ref name="Trolio0429" /> Schur said the writers like writing for Ron because "he's a great mix of a superhero, and also a deeply flawed, and very human and vulnerable person".<ref name="Keller0520" /><ref name="SchurInt0324" />
