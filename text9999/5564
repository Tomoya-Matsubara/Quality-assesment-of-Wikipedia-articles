'''Keynsham''' ({{pron-en|<U+02C8>ke<U+026A>n<U+0283><U+0259>m}}) is a [[town]] and [[civil parishes in England|civil parish]] between [[Bristol]] and [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] in [[Somerset]], south-west England. It has a population of 15,533.<ref name="popn">{{cite web|url=http://neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadTableView.do;jessionid=ac1f930d30d681e83c12fcd8491185f6eece3bebbbd3?a=3&b=791539&c=Keynsham&d=16&e=15&g=397954&i=1001x1003x1004&o=1&m=0&r=1&s=1272629865939&enc=1&a=3&b=791539&c=Keynsham&d=16&e=15&g=397954&i=1001x1003x1004&o=1&m=0&enc=1&dsFamilyId=779&nsjs=true&nsck=true&nssvg=false&nswid=1366|title=Keynsham CP|year=2004|work=Neighbourhood Statistics|publisher=Office of National Statistics|accessdate=30 April 2010}}</ref> 
It was listed in the [[Domesday Book]] as ''Cainesham'', which is believed to mean the home of [[Saint Keyne]]. 

The site of the town has been occupied since [[prehistoric]] times and is scattered with [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] remains. It became a medieval market town, after [[Keynsham Abbey]] was founded around 1170. It is situated at the junction of confluence of the [[River Chew]] and [[River Avon, Bristol|River Avon]] and was subject to serious flooding before the creation of [[Chew Valley Lake]] and river level controls at [[Keynsham Lock]]. The [[Great Flood of 1968]] inundated large parts of the town. It was home to the [[Cadbury-Schweppes|Cadbury's]] chocolate factory, [[Somerdale Factory|Somerdale]], which opened in 1935 as a major employer in the town.

It is home to Memorial Park, which is used for the annual town festival and several nature reserves. The town is served by [[Keynsham railway station]] on the [[Great Western Main Line|London-Bristol]] and [[Wessex Main Line|Bristol-Southampton]] trunk routes and is close to the [[A4 road (England)|A4 road]] which bypassed the town in the 1964. There are also a range of schools, religious sporting and cultural clubs and venues.

== History ==
Evidence of occupation dates back to [[prehistoric]] times, and the town site is scattered with [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] remains, such as the [[Roman villa]]s at [[Somerdale Factory|Somerdale]] which were discovered during the construction of the factory in 1922, and included the discovery of two stone coffins, a villa with nine intact panels of [[mosaic]] flooring at Durley Hill and a burial site between Keynsham and [[Saltford]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://digitalconservation.org/|title=Keynsham Heritage Trust|publisher=Keynsham Heritage Trust|accessdate=25 April 2010}}</ref>

It was listed in the [[Domesday Book]] of 1086 as ''Cainesham'', meaning St Keyne's home. It is believed that [[Saint Keyne]] lived in the 5th century. Her father was named as [[Brychan]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Robinson |first=Stephen |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Somerset Place Names |year=1992 |publisher=The Dovecote Press Ltd |location=Wimbourne |isbn=1874336032}}</ref> According to local legend, St Keyne was warned by the local King that the marshy area was swarming with snakes, which prevented habitation. St Keyne prayed to the heavens and turned the snakes to stone.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.keynsham.co.uk/history/stkeyna.html|title=St Kenya and the ammonites|publisher=Keynsham Community|accessdate=30 April 2010}}</ref> The fossil [[ammonite]]s found in the area were believed to be the result.<ref>{{cite book |author=Readers' Digest |page=158 |title=Folklore, Myth and Legends of Ancient Britain |year=1979|origyear=1977 |publisher=Readers' Digest |location=London|isbn=}}</ref>

The settlement developed into a medieval market town, its growth prompted by the foundation of the influential and prosperous [[Keynsham Abbey]], which had been founded by the Victorine order of [[Augustinian]] monks around 1170. It survived until the [[dissolution of the monasteries]] in 1539, and a house was subsequently built on the site. The remains have been designated as a Grade I [[listed building]] by [[English Heritage]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Keynsham Abbey | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=485012 | accessdate=18 July 2007}}</ref>

Keynsham played a part in the [[Civil War]] as the [[Roundheads]] saved the town and also camped there for the night, using the pub now known as the Lock Keeper Inn as a guard post.<ref name="hist"/> During the [[Monmouth Rebellion]] of 1685 the town was the site of a battle between royalist forces and the rebel [[Duke of Monmouth]].<ref name="hist">{{cite web|url=http://www.keynsham.co.uk/history/monmouthrebellion.html|title=Keynshams part in the Monmouth Rebellion |last=Clark|first=Pete|publisher=Keynsham Community Website|accessdate=30 April 2010}}</ref>

Before the creation of [[Chew Valley Lake]] and river level controls at [[Keynsham Lock]] and weir, Keynsham was prone to flooding. The [[Great Flood of 1968]] inundated large parts of the town, destroying the town's bridges including the county bridge over the Avon which had stood since medieval times, and private premises on Dapps Hill; the devastation was viewed by the [[Duke of Edinburgh]].<ref>{{cite news|title=The day the rains came|url=http://www.thisisbristol.co.uk/news/day-rains-came/article-220159-detail/article.html|accessdate=13 June 2010|newspaper=Evening Post|date=2008-07-15}}</ref> After the flood the Memorial Park, which had been laid out after [[World War II]] was extended.<ref name="mempark">{{cite web|url=http://www.parksandgardens.ac.uk/component/option,com_parksandgardens/task,site/id,2265/tab,summary/Itemid,/|title=Memorial Park, Keynsham, Keynsham, England|work=Parks & Gardens UK|publisher=Parks and Gardens Data Services Limited (PGDS)|accessdate=17 September 2008}}</ref>

Keynsham rose to fame in the mid-1960s after featuring in a long-running series of advertisements on [[Radio Luxembourg (English)|Radio Luxembourg]] for [[Horace Batchelor]]'s Infra-draw betting system.<ref name="bonzos"/> To obtain the system, listeners had to write to Batchelor's Keynsham post office box, and Keynsham was always painstakingly spelled out on-air, with Batchelor famously intoning "Keynsham <U+2013> spelt K-E-Y-N-S-H-A-M <U+2013> Keynsham, Bristol". This was done because the proper pronunciation of Keynsham <U+2013> "Cane-sham" <U+2013> does not make the spelling of Keynsham immediately obvious to the radio listener.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thisisbath.co.uk/news/Doing-Keynsham-pools/article-764050-detail/article.html|title=Doing the Keynsham pools|work=Bath Chronicle|publisher=This is Bath|accessdate=2 February 2009}}</ref>

==Governance==
[[File:Keynsham Council Offices.jpg|thumb|Council Offices]]
The town council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council<U+2019>s operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The town council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and [[Neighbourhood Watch (UK)|neighbourhood watch]] groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The town council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, such as the [[village hall]] or [[community centre]], as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. [[Playing field]]s and [[playground]]s are provided in Memorial Park, Downfield, Kelston Road, Teviot Road, Holmoak Road and Manor Road with [[basketball]] facilities at Teviot Road & Holmoak Road and a [[BMX]] track at Keynsham Road. The Keynsham town council is also responsible for the [[Association football|football]] pitches and pavilion at Manor Road  and the floodlit Multi Sport Site in Memorial Park. They also provide support for community groups organising music and cultural events.<ref>{{cite web|title=Facilities|url=http://www.keynsham-tc.gov.uk/Core/Keynsham-Town-Council/Pages/Facilities_1.aspx|publisher=Keynsham Town Council|accessdate=2 September 2010}}</ref> Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also of interest to the council.

From 1974 until 1996, Keynsham was administered as part of the short-lived county of [[Avon (county)|Avon]]; it has since formed part of the [[unitary authority]] of [[Bath and North East Somerset]], in the [[ceremonial county]] of Somerset. Bath and North East Somerset which was created in 1996, was established by the [[Local Government Act 1992]]. The town is divided into Keynhsam North, which has two Conservative councillors, and Keynsham South which is represented by one Conservative and one Labour councillor.<ref>{{cite web|title=Councillors Contact Details|url=http://www.bathnes.gov.uk/councilanddemocracy/councillorsdemocracyandelections/councillorsinformationandadvice/Pages/councillorscontactdetails.aspx|publisher=BANES|accessdate=2 September 2010}}</ref> Bath and North East Somerset provides a single tier of [[local government in the United Kingdom|local government]] with responsibility for almost all local government functions within its area including [[planning permission|local planning]] and [[Building regulations in the United Kingdom|building control]], local roads, [[council housing]], [[environmental health]], [[market]]s and fairs, [[refuse collection]], [[recycling]], [[cemeteries]], [[crematoria]], leisure services, parks, and [[tourism]]. They are also responsible for [[Local Education Authority|education]], [[social services]], [[library|libraries]], main roads, [[public transport]], [[Trading Standards|trading standards]], [[waste disposal]] and strategic planning, although fire, police and ambulance services are provided jointly with other authorities through the [[Avon Fire and Rescue Service]], [[Avon and Somerset Constabulary]] and the [[Great Western Ambulance Service]]. Bath and North East Somerset's area covers part of the [[Ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial county]] of [[Somerset]] but it is administered independently of the [[non-metropolitan county]]. Its administrative headquarters are in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], but many departments are headquartered in Keynsham. Between April 1, 1974 and April 1, 1996, it was the [[Wansdyke (district)|Wansdyke]] [[Districts of England|district]] and the [[Bath, Somerset|City of Bath]] of the [[county of Avon]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1995/Uksi_19950493_en_1.htm |title=The Avon (Structural Change) Order 1995 |accessdate=9 December 2007 |work=HMSO }}</ref> Before 1974 that the parish was part of the Keynsham Urban District.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/relationships.jsp?u_id=10153116&c_id=10001043|title=Relationships / unit history of KEYNSHAM|work=A vision of Britain|publisher=University of Portsmouth|accessdate=30 April 2010}}</ref>

The parish is represented in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] as part of the [[North East Somerset (UK Parliament constituency)|North East Somerset]] constituency, which is a [[county constituency]] created by the [[Boundary Commissions (United Kingdom)|Boundary Commission for England]] as the successor seat to the [[Wansdyke (UK Parliament constituency)|Wansdyke Parliamentary Seat]]. It came into being at the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 general election]], and is represented by the Conservative [[Jacob Rees-Mogg]]. It elects one [[Member of Parliament|Member of Parliament (MP)]] by the [[first past the post]] system of election. It is also part of the [[South West England (European Parliament constituency)|South West England constituency]] of the [[European Parliament]] which elects six [[Members of the European Parliament|MEPs]] using the [[d'Hondt method]] of [[party-list proportional representation]].

==Geography==
[[File:The lock keeper at Keynsham.jpg|thumb|The Lock Keeper pub on the [[River Avon, Bristol|River Avon]]]]
Keynsham is located on the confluence where the [[River Chew]] meets the [[River Avon, Bristol|River Avon]]. Fishing rights for the Millground and Chewton sections of the Chew are owned by Keynsham Angling Club. The Mill Ground stretch of the River Chew consists of the six fields on the western bank from Chewton Place at [[Chewton Keynsham]] to the Albert Mill. The water is home to a good stock of sizeable [[European chub|Chub]], [[Common Roach|Roach]], [[European perch]] and [[Rudd]], along with good numbers of [[Gudgeon (fish)|Gudgeon]], [[Common dace|Dace]] and [[Brown trout|Trout]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.keynsham-angling.co.uk/chew.htm|title=River Chew|publisher=Keynsham Angling Club|accessdate=30 April 2010}}</ref> [[Keynsham Lock]] on the Avon opened in 1727.<ref name="allsop">{{cite book |last=Allsop |first=Niall |title=The Kennet & Avon Canal |year=1987 |publisher=Millstream Book |location=Bath |isbn=0-948975-15-6 }}</ref> Just above the lock are some visitor moorings and a [[Public house|pub]], on an island between the lock and the [[weir]].

Memorial Park, the northern part of which has existed as parkland since the 19th century,<ref name="memparkgreenflag">{{cite web|title=Keynsham Memorial Park |url=http://www.keepbritaintidy.org/GreenFlag/GreenFlagAwardSites/SouthWest/Default.aspx?parkID=265|publisher=Green Flag|accessdate=2 September 2010}}</ref> as shown by the [[ordnance Survey]] maps of 1864 and 1867,<ref>{{cite web|title=Keynsham Park|url=http://www.keynshampark.co.uk/|publisher=Keynsham Park|accessdate=2 September 2010}}</ref> was formally laid out after [[World War II]] was extended after the floods of 1968.<ref name="mempark"/> It covers {{convert|10.7|ha|acre}} of woodland and grass alongside the River Chew.

The formal gardens within the park are adjacent to the River Chew with the Dapps Hill Woods at its western end.<ref name="memparkgreenflag"/> Part of the park is known locally as Chew Park because of its proximity to the River and another area, close to [[Keynsham Abbey]] as Abbey Park.<ref>{{cite web|title=Keynsham Memorial Park|url=http://www.bathnes.gov.uk/environmentandplanning/parksandopenspaces/Pages/Keynsham%20Memorial%20Park.aspx|publisher=BANES|accessdate=2 September 2010}}</ref> The park received the [[Green Flag Award]] in 2008/09, and again for 2009/10.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bathnes.gov.uk/BathNES/environmentandplanning/parksandopenspaces/Keynsham+Memorial+Park.htm|title=Keynsham Memorial Park|publisher=Bath and North East Somerset Council|accessdate=30 April 2010}}</ref>

On the outskirts of Keynsham lies [[Keynsham Humpy Tumps]], one of the most floristically rich [[acidic grassland]] sites within the [[County of Avon|Avon]] area. The site is on a south-facing slope running alongside the [[Bristol]] to [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] railway line. It consists of open patches of grassland and bare rock, interspersed with blocks of [[scrubland|scrub]]. It is the only site in [[Avon (county)|Avon]] at which [[Upright Chickweed]] ''Moenchia erecta'', occurs. Other locally notable plant species found here include [[Scleranthus annuus|Annual Knawel]] ''Scleranthus annuus'', [[Sand Spurrey]] ''Spergularia rubra'', [[Subterranean Clover]] ''Trifolium subterraneus'' and [[Prickly Sedge]] ''Carex muricata'' ssp.

Current threats to its ecological value include the encroachment of [[scrubland|scrub]] onto the [[grassland]] areas, and damage from [[motorcycle scrambling]]. Between Keynsham and [[Saltford]], a {{convert|15|ha|acre}} area of [[green belt]] has been planted, with over 19,000 trees,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.avonlocalnaturereserves.org.uk/reserve.asp?id=8|title=Manor Road Community Woodland, Local Nature Reserve, Keynsham|publisher=Avon local nature reserves|accessdate=30 April 2010}}</ref> as the [[Manor Road Community Woodland]], which has been designated as a Nature Reserve.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.forestofavon.org.uk/out-and-about/places-to-visit/manor-road|title=Manor Road Community Woodland|publisher=Forest of Avon|accessdate=30 April 2010}}</ref> Nearby is the Avon Valley Country Park tourist attraction.

Along with the rest of [[Climate of south-west England|South West England]], Keynsham has a [[temperate|temperate climate]] which is generally wetter and milder than the rest of England. The annual mean temperature is about 10&nbsp;<U+00B0>C (50&nbsp;<U+00B0>F) with [[seasonal]] and [[Diurnal motion|diurnal]] variations, but due to the modifying effect of the sea, the range is less than in most other parts of the United Kingdom. January is the coldest month with mean minimum temperatures between 1&nbsp;<U+00B0>C (34&nbsp;<U+00B0>F) and 2&nbsp;<U+00B0>C (36&nbsp;<U+00B0>F). July and August are the warmest months in the region with mean daily maxima around 21&nbsp;<U+00B0>C (70&nbsp;<U+00B0>F). In general, December is the dullest month and June the sunniest. The south west of England enjoys a favoured location, particularly in summer, when the [[Azores High]] extends its influence north-eastwards towards the UK.<ref name="weather">{{cite web | title=South West England: climate | work=Met Office |url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/sw/ | accessdate=14 March 2010}}</ref>

[[Cumulus cloud|Cloud]] often forms inland, especially near hills, and reduces exposure to sunshine. The average annual sunshine totals around 1600 hours. [[Precipitation (meteorology)|Rainfall]] tends to be associated with [[Atlantic]] [[Low pressure area|depressions]] or with convection. In summer, convection caused by solar surface heating sometimes forms shower [[cloud]]s and a large proportion of the annual precipitation falls from showers and [[thunderstorms]] at this time of year. Average rainfall is around 800<U+2013>900&nbsp;mm (31<U+2013>35&nbsp;in). About 8<U+2013>15 days of [[snowfall]] is typical. November to March have the highest mean [[wind]] speeds, with June to August having the lightest. The predominant wind direction is from the south west.<ref name="weather"/>

== Economy ==
[[File:Somerdale Factory, Keynsham, from lawns.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The Somerdale Factory from front lawns]]
An important industry in the town was [[Cadbury-Schweppes|Cadbury's]] chocolate factory, the [[Somerdale Factory]]. The [[J. S. Fry & Sons]] business merged with Cadbury in 1919, and moved their factory in the centre of Bristol to Keynsham in 1935.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7025413.stm|title=Cadbury factories shed 700 jobs |date=2007-10-03|publisher=BBC|accessdate=30 April 2010}}</ref> As [[Quakers]], the factory was built in a {{convert|228|acre|km2|sing=on}} greenfield site with social facilities, including playing fields and recreational sports grounds. Called Somerdale after a national competition in 1923, Keynsham Cadbury is the home of [[Fry's Chocolate Cream]], the [[Double Decker (chocolate bar)|Double Decker]], [[Dairy Milk]] and Mini Eggs, [[Cadbury's Fudge]], Chomp and [[Crunchie]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8507066.stm|title=Cadbury's Bristol plant to close by 2011 |date=2010-02-09|publisher=BBC|accessdate=30 April 2010}}</ref>

On 3 October 2007, Cadbury announced plans to close the Somerdale plant by 2010 with the loss of some 500 jobs. In an effort to maintain competitiveness in a global marketplace, production will be moved to factories in [[Birmingham]] and Poland. In the longer term it is likely the greenfield site will be re-classified and provide Keynsham with additional housing. Labour MP for Wansdyke, [[Dan Norris]], said "news of the factory's closure is a hard and heavy blow, not just to the workforce, but to the Keynsham community as a whole".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7025413.stm |title=Cadbury factories shed 700 jobs |accessdate=3 October 2007 |last= |first= |coauthors= |date=3 October 2007 |work=BBC News |publisher=}}</ref> In late 2007 campaigns to save the Cadbury's factory in Somerdale were in full swing. One local resident started a campaign to urge [[English Heritage]] to protect the site, and preserve the history of the factory. The campaign did not succeed and as of February 2009 the site is still scheduled for closure, and likely demolition. Cadbury have suggested that the land be redeveloped as a mixture of housing and commercial interests, giving a figure of approximately 900 jobs being created as a result.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thisisbath.co.uk/news/900-jobs-created-Cadbury-development/article-734658-detail/article.html|title=900 jobs could be created by Cadbury development|date=2009-02-27|work=Bath Chronicle|publisher=This is Bath|accessdate=30 April 2010}}</ref>

Before their takeover of Cadbury in February 2010, [[Kraft Foods]] had pledged to keep the Cadbury factory at Somerdale open if they were successful in their bid for the company.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://phx.corporate-ir.net/External.File?item=UGFyZW50SUQ9MTQ1ODZ8Q2&nbsp;hpbGRJRD0tMXxUeXBlPTM=&t=1|title=Takeover bid|date=2009-09-07|publisher=Thompson Reuters|accessdate=30 April 2010}}</ref> However, within a week of completing their purchase of Cadbury, Kraft CEO Irene Rosenfeld released a statement announcing that Kraft were to close the factory by 2011, as originally planned by Cadbury.

The town is served by [[Keynsham railway station]] on the [[Great Western Main Line|London-Bristol]] and [[Wessex Main Line|Bristol-Southampton]] trunk routes. It opened in 1840 and was re-named Keynsham and Somerdale in 1925. The factory had its own rail system which was connected to the mainline. The connection to Fry's chocolate factory was taken out of use on the 26<U+2013>27 July 1980. The station's name reverted to Keynsham on the 6 May 1974.

== Education ==

State-funded schools are organised within the [[Unitary authorities of England|unitary authority]] of Bath and North East Somerset. A review of Secondary Education in Bath was started in 2007, primarily to reduce surplus provision and reduce the number of single-sex secondary schools in Bath, and to access capital funds available through the government's Building Schools for the Future programme.<ref>{{Cite document|url=http://www.bathnes.gov.uk/BathNES/councilanddemocracy/consultations/SchoolsConsultation/secondary/|title=Secondary School Reviews|publisher=Bath and North East Somerset Council|accessdate=2008-06-23}}</ref> There are  several primary schools in Keynsham, including St Johns primary school, Castle Primary school, Chandag infants and junior school and new school St Keyna primary school (a merge of Keynsham primary school and 150 yr old Temple Primary school). There are also two secondary schools, [[Wellsway School]] and [[Broadlands School]].

[[File:Broadlands School.jpg|thumb|left|[[Broadlands School]]]]
Wellsway School is an 11<U+2013>18, mixed [[comprehensive school]] which was established in 1971, by amalgamating Keynsham Grammar School and Wellsway County Secondary School both of which opened on a shared site in the mid 1950s. Most students that attend the school live in Keynsham and [[Saltford]] or the nearby villages.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wellsway.bathnes.sch.uk/news/ofsted/2003.pdf |title=Wellsway School Inspection 2003 |accessdate=24 July 2007 |format=PDF |work=OFSTED }}</ref> As of 2007, approximately 1350 students attend the school, ranging in age of 11<U+2013>18, with 64% achieving 5 or more A-C grades at GCSE.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dfes.gov.uk/cgi-bin/performancetables/school_06.pl?Mode=Z&Type=P&No=8004138&Phase=1&Year=06&Num=p483&Base=a&s2s=1 |title=Wellsway School achievement tables |accessdate=24 July 2007 |format= |work=Department for children schools and families }}</ref> Wellsway's bid for [[specialist school]] status was accepted in September 2007.

==Religious sites==
[[File:St John the Baptist, Keynsham, tower end.jpg|thumb|upright|St John's church]]
Begun in 1292, the [[Anglican]] parish church of St John the Baptist gradually evolved until taking its present general form during the reign of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], after the tower collapsed into the building during a storm in 1632.<ref name="IoEStjohns"/> The tower, built over the north-east corner of the nave, now rises in three stages over the Western entrance and is surmounted by a pierced [[parapet]] and short croketted [[pinnacle]]s and is said to have been built from the ruins of the abbey church. The south aisle and south porch date from 1390. The chancel, then the responsibility of the abbey, was rebuilt in 1470 and further restoration was carried out in 1634<U+2013>1655, following the collapse of the tower. There is a pulpit dating from 1634 and is also a screen of the same age which shuts off the choir vestry. It has been designated as a Grade II* [[listed building]].<ref name="IoEStjohns">{{cite web|url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/Details/Default.aspx?id=485063|title=Church of St John the Baptist|work=Images of England|publisher=English Heritage|accessdate=24 March 2009}}</ref>

A former organ is said to have stood in the church, but "had tones so mellow" that [[Handel]] bargained for it, offering a peal of bells in exchange.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Johnstone|first=H.
