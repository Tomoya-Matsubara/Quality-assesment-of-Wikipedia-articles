===Prehistory and founding===
[[File:Egg Rock Inscription.jpg|left|thumb|275px|Photo of Egg Rock inscription, about 1900]]

In 1635, a group of settlers from Britain led by Rev. [[Peter Bulkley]] and Major [[Simon Willard (First generation)|Simon Willard]] negotiated a land purchase with the remnants of the local tribe. Bulkley was an influential religious leader who "carried a good number of planters with him into the woods";<ref>[[Moses Coit Tyler]]<U+00A0>(1883).<U+00A0>[[A History of American Literature.]]<U+00A0>[[G.

===Battle of Lexington and Concord===
{{main|Battles of Lexington and Concord}}
The [[Battle of Lexington and Concord]] was the initial conflict in the [[American Revolutionary War]]. On April 19, 1775, a force of [[British Army]] [[Regular army|regulars]] marched from [[Boston]] to Concord to capture a cache of arms that was reportedly stored in the town. Forewarned by [[Paul Revere]] and other messengers, the colonists mustered in opposition. Following an early-morning skirmish at [[Lexington, Massachusetts|Lexington]], where the first shots of the battle were fired, the British expedition under the command of [[Francis Smith (British Army officer)|Lt. Col. Francis Smith]] advanced to Concord. There, colonists from Concord and surrounding towns (notably a highly-drilled company from [[Acton, Massachusetts|Acton]] led by [[Isaac Davis (soldier)|Isaac Davis]]) [[Battle of Concord#The North Bridge|repulsed a British detachment]] at the [[Old North Bridge]] and forced the British troops to retreat.<ref name="LOC">{{cite web | last = | first = | url = http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/today/apr19.html | title = Today In History: April 19th | work = | publisher = The Library of Congress | accessdate = April 3, 2007}}</ref> Subsequently, militia arriving from across the region [[Battles of Lexington and Concord#Return march|harried the British troops]] on their return to Boston, culminating in the [[Siege of Boston]] and outbreak of the war.

The battle was initially publicized by the colonists as an example of British brutality and aggression: one colonial [[broadside (printing)|broadside]] decried the "Bloody Butchery of the British Troops."<ref name="Randolph">{{cite book | last = Randolph | first = Ryan | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=DItAX0GNQpwC&pg=PT85&lpg=PT85&dq=%22coffin+broadside%22+-jackson#PPT86,M1 | title = Paul Revere and the Minutemen of the American Revolution | work = | publisher = The Rosen Publishing Group via Google Books | accessdate = April 9, 2007}}</ref> A century later, however, the conflict was remembered proudly by Americans, taking on a patriotic, almost mythic status ([[Shot heard 'round the world|"the shot heard 'round the world"]]) in works like the "[[Concord Hymn]]" and "[[Paul Revere's Ride (poem)|Paul Revere's Ride]]."<ref name="Revere">{{cite web | last = Gioia | first = Dana | url = http://www.danagioia.net/essays/elongfellow.htm | title = "On "Paul Revere's Ride" by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow" | work = | publisher = | accessdate = April 2, 2007}}</ref> In April 1975, the town hosted a bicentennial celebration of the battle, featuring an address at the Old North Bridge by President [[Gerald Ford]].<ref name="Ford">{{cite web | last = | first = | url = http://www.mass.gov/lib/ | title = Featured Resource: Photograph Collection 374 | work = | publisher = The State Library of Massachusetts | accessdate = April 9, 2007}}</ref>

===Literary history===
[[File:The Old Manse (view from Concord River), Concord, Massachusetts.JPG|thumb|left| 250px| [[The Old Manse]], home to [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] and later [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]]]]
Concord has a remarkably rich literary history centered in the mid-nineteenth century around [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] (1803<U+2013>1882), who moved to the town in 1835 and quickly became its most prominent citizen.<ref name="EmersontoConcord">{{cite web | last = | first = | url = http://www.concordlibrary.org/scollect/Emerson_Celebration/Introduction.html | title = Emerson in Concord | work = | publisher = Concord Public Library <U+2013> Special Collections | accessdate = April 18, 2007}}</ref> Emerson, a successful lecturer and philosopher, had deep roots in the town: his father [[William Emerson (minister)|Rev. William Emerson]] (1769<U+2013>1811) grew up in Concord before becoming an eminent Boston minister, and his grandfather, [[William Emerson Sr.]], witnessed the battle at the North Bridge from his house, and later became a chaplain in the Continental Army.<ref name="Emerson">{{cite web | last = | first = | url = http://www.concordnet.org/library/scollect/Emerson_Celebration/Section_1_Essay.html | title = Emerson's Concord Heritage | work = | publisher = Concord Public Library <U+2013> Special Collections | accessdate = April 9, 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070205235202/http://www.concordnet.org/library/scollect/Emerson_Celebration/Section_1_Essay.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = February 5, 2007}}</ref> Emerson was at the center of a group of like-minded [[Transcendentalism|Transcendentalists]] living in Concord.<ref name="WPond">{{cite web | last = | first = | url = http://www.mass.gov/dcr/parks/northeast/wldn.htm | title = Henry David Thoreau | work = | publisher = Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation | accessdate = April 9, 2007}}</ref> Among them were the author [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]] (1804<U+2013>1864) and the philosopher [[Bronson Alcott]] (1799<U+2013>1888), the father of [[Louisa May Alcott]] (1832<U+2013>1888). A native Concordian, [[Henry David Thoreau]] (1817<U+2013>1862), was another notable member of Emerson's circle. This substantial collection of literary talent in one small town led [[Henry James]] to dub Concord "the biggest little place in America."<ref name="Cheever">{{cite web | last = Kehe | first = Marjorie | url = http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/1219/p14s02-bogn.html | title = Scenes from an American Eden | work = | publisher = The Christian Science Monitor | accessdate = March 6, 2007}}</ref>

Hawthorne dubbed the house "The Wayside" and lived there until his death. The house was purchased in 1883 by Boston publisher Daniel Lothrop and his wife, Harriett, who wrote the [[Five Little Peppers]] series and other children's books under the pen name [[Margaret Sidney]].<ref name="Sidney">{{cite web | last = | first = | url = http://www.nps.gov/archive/mima/wayside/Marg.htm | title = The Wayside Authors | work = | publisher = National Park Service | accessdate = April 9, 2007}}</ref> Today, The Wayside and the Orchard House are both museums.
