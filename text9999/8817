'''James O'Mara''' (6 August 1873 <U+2013> 21 November 1948) was an [[Irish people|Irish]] businessman and [[politician]] who became a [[Irish nationalism| nationalist]] leader and key member of the revolutionary [[First D<U+00E1>il]].<ref name=oireachtas_db>{{cite web|url=http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&HouseNum=1&MemberID=2112&ConstID=121|title=Mr. James O'Mara|work=Oireachtas Members Database|accessdate=8 March 2012}}</ref> As an [[Member of Parliament|MP]] in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], he introduced the bill which made [[Saint Patrick's Day]] a national holiday in [[Ireland]] in 1903.  He was one of the [[Records of members of the Oireachtas#Members of both the British Parliament and of the Oireachtas|few politicians to have served]] both as member in the House of Commons and  in [[D<U+00E1>il <U+00C9>ireann (Irish Free State)|D<U+00E1>il <U+00C9>ireann]].

==Early life==
Born in [[Limerick]], O'Mara was educated by the [[Congregation of Christian Brothers|Christian Brothers]] in [[Limerick]], and at [[Clongowes Wood College]] in [[Dublin]]. His studies at the [[Royal University of Ireland]] were postponed after the death of his Uncle Jim in 1893, when James was sent to [[London]] to take over his Uncle's business functions. After his marriage in 1895 to Agnes Cashel, he moved to [[Epsom]] in [[Surrey]], and then to [[Sydenham]] in London. He finally got his [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] degree from the Royal University in 1898.

==Political career==
In the [[United Kingdom general election, 1900|1900 general election]], O'Mara was elected unopposed as [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]] for [[South Kilkenny (UK Parliament constituency)|South Kilkenny]].

His career in [[Palace of Westminster|Westminster]] is noted for his introduction of the [[Bill (proposed law)|Bill]] which became the Bank Holiday (Ireland) Act 1903, making [[Saint Patrick's Day]] a national holiday. O'Mara later introduced the law which required that pubs be closed on 17 March, a provision which was repealed only in the 1970s.

In 1907, O'Mara resigned from Parliament and from the Irish Parliamentary Party to join [[Sinn F<U+00E9>in]], the first MP to do so. He returned to Dublin in 1914 to continue his work in the bacon business, and remained active in Sinn F<U+00E9>in.

==D<U+00E1>il <U+00C9>ireann==
At the [[Irish general election, 1918|1918 general election]], he was Sinn F<U+00E9>in's Director of Finance and the party's fourth Director of Elections (his three predecessors having been imprisoned). He was elected as a [[Sinn F<U+00E9>in]] MP for his old constituency of [[Kilkenny South (D<U+00E1>il <U+00C9>ireann constituency)|Kilkenny South]], defeating the Irish Party's [[Matthew Keating (politician)|Matthew Keating]] by 8,685 votes to 1,855.<ref name=elecs_irl>{{cite web|url=http://electionsireland.org/candidate.cfm?ID=1471|title=James O'Mara|work=ElectionsIreland.org|accessdate=8 March 2012}}</ref> South Kilkenny was one of 73 constituencies returning Sinn F<U+00E9>in MPs pledged not to take their seats at Westminster. In the [[First D<U+00E1>il|First D<U+00E1>il <U+00C9>ireann]] he became Trustee of D<U+00E1>il <U+00C9>ireann funds, and travelled to the [[United States]] with [[<U+00C9>amon de Valera]] to pursue a fund-raising drive. He resigned his trusteeship and his D<U+00E1>il seat in 1921 after a disagreement with de Valera.

A supporter of the 1921 [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]], he was appointed as the first Irish Ambassador to the United States, but served only briefly.

After the death in 1923 of [[Philip Cosgrave]], the [[Cumann na nGaedheal]] [[Teachta D<U+00E1>la|TD]] for [[Dublin South (D<U+00E1>il <U+00C9>ireann constituency)|Dublin South]] and brother of [[W. T. Cosgrave]], O'Mara stood as the Cumann na nGaedheal candidate in the [[Dublin South by-election, 1924|resulting by-election]]. Polling took place on 12 March 1924<ref name="dublinsouthbyelection">{{cite web|url=http://electionsireland.org/result.cfm?election=1923B&cons=102%20&ref=3|work=ElectionsIreland.org|title=4th D<U+00E1>il By elections - Dublin South}}</ref>, and O'Mara was returned to the [[4th D<U+00E1>il]], which sat until 1927. He did not contest the [[Irish general election, June 1927|June 1927 general election]], and retired from politics.

He died on 21 November 1948 and is buried in [[Glasnevin Cemetery]], [[Dublin]]. His wife Agnes died on 2 June 1958.
