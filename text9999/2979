{{otheruses4|the urban area of Perth, Western Australia|the local government area|City of Perth}}
'''Perth''' is the [[List of Australian capital cities|capital]] of the [[Australian]] [[States and territories of Australia|state]] of [[Western Australia]]. A population of 1,507,900<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/mf/3218.0?OpenDocument|title=Regional Population Growth, Australia, 2005-2006|work=Australian Bureau of Statistics (www.abs.gov.au)}}</ref> (2006 estimate) makes Perth the largest city in Western Australia and home to three-quarters of the state's residents. The city is also the fourth most populous urban area in Australia, and with a growth rate of 2% is currently the fastest growing major city in Australia. 

Perth was founded on [[June 11]], [[1829]] by [[Captain James Stirling]] as the political centre of the free settler [[Swan River Colony]]. It has continued to serve as the seat of Government for Western Australia to the present day.

The [[metropolitan area]] is located in the south west of the continent between the [[Indian Ocean]] and a low coastal escarpment known as the [[Darling Range]]. The [[central business district]] and suburbs of Perth are situated on the [[Swan River (Western Australia)|Swan River]].

==History==
{{main|History of Perth, Western Australia}}
Founded in [[1829]] by Captain [[James Stirling]] as the political centre of the free [[settler]] [[Swan River Colony]], Perth has continued to serve as the seat of Government for Western Australia to the present day. 

===Prehistory===
[[Image:CSIslands.gif|thumb|140px|left|Rottnest and Garden Islands]]

Prior to [[European]] settlement the area had been inhabited by the [[Whadjuk]] [[Noongar]] people for 40,000 years, as evidenced by archaeological findings on the Upper Swan River.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archaeology.arts.uwa.edu.au/staff/bowdler__research_interests/the_pleistocene_pacific|title=The Pleistocene Pacific|author=Sandra Bowdler|work=University of Western Australia}}</ref> These [[Indigenous Australian|Aborigines]] occupied the southwest corner of Western Australia, living as hunter-gatherers. The lakes on the coastal plain were particularly important to them, providing both spiritual and physical sustenance.

[[Rottnest Island|Rottnest]], [[Carnac Island|Carnac]] and [[Garden Island (Western Australia)|Garden]] Islands were also important to the Noongar. About 5,000 years ago the sea levels were low enough that they could walk to the limestone outcrops.

The area where Perth now stands was called Boorloo by the Aboriginals living there at the time of their first contact with Europeans in [[1827]]. Boorloo formed part of Mooro, the tribal lands of the Yellagonga, one of several groups based around the Swan River and known collectively as the [[Whadjuk]]. The Whadjuk were part of a larger group of thirteen or more tribes which formed the south west socio-linguistic block known as the [[Noongar]] (''The People''), also sometimes called the ''[[Bibbulmun]]''.

===Early European sightings===
The first documented European sighting of the region was made by the [[Flemish people|Flemish]] Captain [[Willem de Vlamingh]] and his crew on [[January 10]] [[1697]]. Subsequent sightings between this date and 1829 were made by other Europeans, but as in the case of the sighting and observations made by Vlamingh, the area was considered to be inhospitable and unsuitable for the agriculture which would be needed to sustain a settlement.

===The Swan River Colony===

[[Image:Southperthview.jpg|thumb|270px|right|South Perth's skyline]]

Although the [[British Army]] had established a base at [[Albany, Western Australia|King George Sound]] (later Albany) on the south coast of western Australia in 1826 in response to rumours that the area would be annexed by [[France]], Perth was the first full scale settlement by Europeans in the western third of the continent. The colony itself would be officially designated Western Australia in 1832, but was known informally for many years as the Swan River Colony after the area's major watercourse.

On [[4 June]] [[1829]], newly arriving colonists had their first view of the mainland and Western Australia's Foundation Day has since been recognised by a public holiday on the first Monday in June each year. Captain [[James Stirling (Australian governor)|James Stirling]], aboard the [[Parmelia (barque)|''Parmelia'']], said that Perth was "as beautiful as anything of this kind I had ever witnessed." On 12 August that year, Mrs. Helen Dance, wife of the Captain of the second ship ''Sulphur'', cut down a tree to mark the founding of the town.

The name ''Perth'' was chosen by [[James Stirling (Australian governor)|James Stirling]] for the new town. Stirling, a Scot, acted in  accordance with the wish of [[George Murray (Lieutenant-Governor)|Sir George Murray]], [[Secretary of State for War and the Colonies]], that the town be named after [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]], [[Scotland]], which was Murray's birthplace and parliamentary seat in the [[British House of Commons]]. 

Beginning in 1831, hostile encounters between European settlers and Aborigines of the local Noongar tribe <U+2013> both large-scale land users with conflicting land value systems <U+2013> increased considerably as the colony grew. This violent phase of the region's history culminated in a series of events in which the Europeans overcame the indigenous people, including the execution of Whadjuk tribal chief Midgegooroo, the murder of his son [[Yagan]] in 1833, and the one-sided [[Battle of Pinjarra]] in 1834.

By 1843, when the tribal chief Yellagonga died, his tribe had begun to disintegrate after having been dispossessed of the land around the main settlement area of Perth. They retreated to the swamps and lakes north of the settlement area including Third Swamp, known to them as Boodjamooling.  The oral history of the area as related by a Noongar elder, [[Fred Collard]], likens Boodjamooling prior to white settlement to a supermarket for the aboriginal people, where there was a bountiful, self-sustaining, and varied supply of food.

Boodjamooling continued to be a main campsite for the remaining Noongar people in the Perth region, and was also used by travellers, itinerants, and homeless people. By the goldrush days of the 1890s they were joined by miners who were en-route to the goldfields.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20050701184100/http://www.vincent.wa.gov.au/eservice/townofv/history.htm|title=History of the Town of Vincent|work=Town of Vincent (Internet Archive copy)}} Adapted from 'History of the Town of Vincent', from Town of Vincent 2001 Annual Report, p.52 (possibly based on J. Gentili and others)</ref>

In 1850, Western Australia was opened to [[convicts]] at the request of farming and business people looking for cheap labour.<ref>[http://www.perth.wa.gov.au/html/vis09_.php A Brief History] www.perth.wa.gov.au </ref> Queen Victoria announced the city status of Perth in 1856.<ref>[http://worldfacts.us/Australia-Perth.htm History of Perth] worldfacts.us </ref>

After a referendum in 1900, Western Australia joined the [[Federation of Australia]] in 1901. It was the last of the Australian colonies to agree to join the Federation, and did so only after the other colonies had offered several concessions, including the construction of a rail line to Perth (via [[Kalgoorlie, Western Australia|Kalgoorlie]]) from the eastern states.

In 1933, Western Australia voted in a referendum to leave the Australian union, with a majority of two to one in favor of independence. However, an election held shortly before the referendum had turned out the incumbent "pro-independence" government, replacing it with a government which did not support the independence movement.<ref>[http://www.ccentre.wa.gov.au/index.cfm?event=government20thCentury] www.ccentre.wa.gov.au</ref> Respecting the result of the referendum, the new government nonetheless petitioned the United Kingdom for independence, where the request was simply ignored. 

Perth has prospered by becoming a key service centre for the natural resource industries, being the closest city to huge reserves of [[gold]], [[iron|iron ore]], [[nickel]], [[alumina]], [[manganese]], [[diamond]]s, [[mineral sands]], [[coal]], [[oil]], and [[natural gas]].<ref>[http://www.ga.gov.au/pdf/RR0112.pdf Geoscience Australia - Australia's identified mineral resources, 2002.] www.ga.gov.au (PDF 2MB)</ref>  Most of the world's major resource and engineering companies have offices in Perth. Partially as a result of this influx, Perth has become highly ethnically diverse, with over 27% of inhabitants having been born overseas (495,240 persons) and a further 414,000 having an overseas born parent (2001 census). 11% speak a language other than English at home.  Perth also has a larger alternative sexuality community than would have been expected from a town of its traditional roots. Two thirds of the Perth population are of the Christian faith, with other major religions including Buddhism and Islam.The proportion of the population that has no religious affiliation has remained consistent since 1991.

==Geography==

<!--===Location=== 
Perth is the most isolated [[metropolitan area]] on Earth. The nearest city to it with a population of over 1 million is [[Adelaide]] in [[South Australia]], a distance of approximately 2,104 kilometers (1,307 miles).

===City skyline=== 
[[Image:perth_wa.jpg|right|thumb|400px|Perth, Western Australia (Jan 2005)]]
Traditionally, Perth and the Swan River have usually been viewed and photographed from [[Kings Park, Western Australia|Kings Park]], situated on Mount Eliza to the near south-west of the city centre or from the South Perth foreshore.  The historical record of the view shows clear river banks close to the city and a low skyline through to the 1960s.  Since then, the filling in of the northern side of Perth Water and crowding of the skyline have continued unabated.
Perth's city skyline displays the economic prosperity the city currently enjoys. The tallest building in the city is [[Central Park (skyscraper)|Central Park]], which is the sixth tallest building in Australia.<ref name=TallBuilding>[http://www.emporis.com/en/bu/sk/st/tp/co/?id=100012 Worlds tallest skyscrapers by country]</ref>

===Central Business District===
The [[central business district]] of Perth is bounded by the Swan River to the south and east, with Kings Park on the western end, while the railway lines form a northern border. [[St Georges Terrace, Perth|St Georges Terrace]] is the prominent street of the area with more than two thirds of the 1.3 million m<U+00B2> of office space in the CBD.<ref>[http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/ci/?id=100506 Perth, commercial area information]</ref> [[Hay Street, Perth|Hay Street]] and [[Murray Street, Perth|Murray Street]] have most of the retail and entertainment facilities.

===Sand plain setting===
[[image:Perth.jpg|thumb|160px|left|Satellite imagery of Perth]]

Perth is set on the [[Swan River (Western Australia)|Swan River]], so named because of the native [[black swans]]. Traditionally, this water body has been known by local inhabitants as ''Derbal Yerrigan''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dtf.wa.gov.au/cms/uploadedFiles/200607_02_Part10_Indigenous_Affairs.pdf|title=Indigenous Affairs|pages=4|work=Department of Indigenous Affairs|year=2006}}</ref>  A Dutch expedition in 1697 captained by [[Willem de Vlamingh]] led to Vlamingh naming the river after the [[Black Swan|black swans]].<ref>[http://www.175anniversary.wa.gov.au/index.cfm?fuseaction=heritage_icons.january Heritage Icons: The Swan River] www.175anniversary.wa.gov.au</ref> The city centre and most of the suburbs are located on the sandy and relatively flat [[Swan Coastal Plain]], which lies between the [[Darling Scarp]] and the [[Indian Ocean]]. The metropolitan area extends to [[Yanchep, Western Australia|Yanchep]] in the north, [[Mandurah]] in the south, total distance of approximately 125 [[kilometre]]s (78&nbsp;[[mile|mi]]) by road. From the Coast in the west to [[Mundaring]] in the east, a total distance of approximately 50 kilometres (30&nbsp;mi) by road. This means that the area of Perth is over 1.5 million acres.

The coastal suburbs take advantage of Perth's oceanside location and clean [[beaches]]. To the east, the city is bordered by a low escarpment called the [[Darling Scarp]]. Perth is on generally flat, rolling land - largely due to the high amount of sandy soils and deep bedrock.  The Perth metropolitan area has two major river systems, the first is made up of the Swan and [[Canning River (Western Australia)|Canning Rivers]]. The second is that of the [[Serpentine River (Western Australia)|Serpentine]] and Murray Rivers, which discharge into the Peel Estuary at Mandurah.

===Climate===
Perth summers are hot and dry, summer lasts from late December to late February, with February generally being the hottest month of the year. The hottest ever recorded temperature in Perth was 46.2&nbsp;<U+00B0>[[Celsius|C]] (115&nbsp;<U+00B0>[[Fahrenheit|F]]) on [[23 February]] [[1991]].  Winters are cool and moist, though winter rainfall has been declining in recent years. This is an example of a [[Mediterranean climate]]. The coldest temperature recorded was -0.7&nbsp;<U+00B0>C (30.7&nbsp;<U+00B0>F) on [[17 June]] [[2006]], and the only temperature ever recorded below the [[freezing point]].  Even in mid-winter, maximum daytime temperatures only occasionally fall below 16&nbsp;<U+00B0>C (60&nbsp;<U+00B0>F). Though most rainfall occurs during winter, the wettest ever day was on [[9 February]] [[1992]] when 121 millimetres (4.75&nbsp;[[inch|in]]) fell. On most summer afternoons a [[sea breeze]], also known as "[[Fremantle doctor|The Fremantle Doctor]]", blows from the south-west cooling the city. Snow does not fall in Perth, and whilst being recorded in the hills adjacent to the city, this hasn't occurred since 1956.

Perth's earliest European settlers were [[British people|British]] and [[Irish people|Irish]], and Britain and Ireland remained the city's primary source countries for the first century of its existence. However, by the mid-twentieth century significant numbers of [[Italian people|Italians]] and [[Greek people|Greeks]] had settled. As [[Fremantle, Western Australia|Fremantle]] was the first landfall in Australia for many migrant ships coming from Europe in the 1950s and 1960s, Perth started to experience a diverse influx which included [[Dutch people|Dutch]], [[German people|Germans]], [[Croatian people|Croats]] and [[Macedonian people|Macedonians]] and many others. The names of many of these migrants are listed on the honour board outside the Maritime Museum.

More recently, large-scale immigration to Perth by air from Britain has continued, giving Perth the highest-proportion of British-born residents of any Australian city &mdash; according to the 2001 census, 23.5 per cent of residents in the Joondalup North statistical subdivision in the north of the city were born in Britain, closely followed by Rockingham in the south with 19.8 per cent. The proportion of British-born in the Perth metropolitan area as a whole in 2001 was 12.4 per cent, or 164,488 persons. This is significantly higher than the national proportion of 5.5 per cent.<ref>[http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@cpp.nsf/DetailsPage/5051541712001?OpenDocument&tabname=Details&prodno=505154171&issue=2001&num=&view=&#Basic%20Community%20Profile Australian Bureau of Statistics - 2001 Census Data] Joondalup (C) - North (Statistical Local Area) www.abs.gov.au/ausstats</ref>

Whilst no other community approaches the demographic weight of those born in Britain, many migrants &mdash; 32,544 or 2.5 per cent in 2001 &mdash; are from [[New Zealand]], due to the fact that New Zealanders, unlike other foreign nationals, are eligible for 'special category' visas, which allow them to live and work in Australia with little restriction. For this reason, the New Zealand-born community in Perth is increasing proportionately faster than any other birthplace group.<ref>[http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@cpp.nsf/Lookup/505Snapshot12001?OpenDocument&TabName=Summary&ProdNo=505&Issue=2001&Num=&View=&]</ref>

Perth also has substantial immigrant communities from Europe &mdash; [[Italians]] are the third largest migrant group, numbering 20,611 or 1.6 per cent in 2001. [[Irish people|Irish]] and [[Croats]] are also well represented.<ref>[http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@cpp.nsf/Lookup/505Snapshot12001?OpenDocument&TabName=Summary&ProdNo=505&Issue=2001&Num=&View=&]</ref>

In the last three decades, South East Asia has become an increasingly important source of migrants, with communities from [[Malaysia]], [[Vietnam]], [[Singapore]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Indonesia]], [[China]], [[Pakistan]], [[India]] and [[Sri Lanka]] all now well-established. The Indian community includes a substantial number of [[Parsi|Parsees]] who emigrated from [[Mumbai]] &mdash; Perth being the closest Australian city to India.

Another more recent source has been [[Southern Africa]], with many white [[South Africa]]ns and [[Zimbabwe]]ans settling in the city in the latter half of the 1990s. Perth nowadays also has the largest population of [[Anglo-Burmese]] in the world, in addition to a substantial [[Anglo-Indian]] and [[Eurasian (mixed ancestry)|Eurasian]] community.

=== Metropolitan Regional Scheme ===
{{main|Metropolitan Region Scheme}}
[[Image:MASB.gif|thumb|180px|right|Area of the Perth Metropolitan Region Scheme]]
The Metropolitan Region Scheme (MRS) is the legal land plan covering the Perth metropolitan region. It classifies land into broad zones and reservations. As the regions develop, so the schemes must be amended.

It is a large town planning scheme for land use in the Perth metropolitan area which defines the future use of land, dividing it into broad zones and reservations.  It requires local government town planning schemes to provide detailed plans for their part of the region.  These schemes must be consistent with the MRS.

Deriving from Prof. Gordon Stephenson's 1955 ''Plan for the Metropolitan Region, Perth and Fremantle'' ("Corridor Plan"), the MRS has been in operation since 1963 and provides the legal basis for planning in the Perth metropolitan region.

==Education==
:''See also: [[Western Australia#Education|Western Australia]] for general information on education in Western Australia''

Perth is home to four public universities, and one private university: the [[University of Western Australia]], [[Murdoch University]], [[Curtin University of Technology]], [[Edith Cowan University]], and the [[University of Notre Dame Australia|University of Notre Dame]] respectively.

[[Image:UWAWinthropHallSunsetcurves gobeirne.jpg|thumb|200px|UWA is located at Crawley]]
The [[University of Western Australia]], which was founded in 1911,<ref>[http://www.uwa.edu.au/visitors/about/history History of the University] www.uwa.edu.au</ref> is renowned as one of Australia's leading research institutions. The university's monumental neo-classical architecture, most of which is carved from white limestone, is a notable tourist destination in the city. 

[[Curtin University of Technology]] is Western Australia's largest university by student population, and was known from its founding in 1966 until 1986 as the Western Australian Institute of Technology (''WAIT'') and had amalgamated with The WA School of Mines Kalgoorlie and the Muresk Agricultural College Northam. 
[[Murdoch University]] was established in the 1970s, and is Australia's geographically largest campus (2.27 square kilometres), necessary to accommodate Western Australia's only veterinary school.
[[Edith Cowan University]] was established in the early 1990s from the existing Western Australian College of Advanced Education (WACAE) which itself was formed in the 1970s from the existing Teachers Colleges at Claremont, Churchlands, and Mount Lawley. It incorporates the Western Australian Academy of Performing Arts (WAAPA). 
The [[University of Notre Dame Australia|University of Notre Dame]] was established in 1990.

Colleges of TAFE (Technical and Further Education) provide trade and vocational training, including Diploma level courses. TAFE was formed in the 1970s to provide technical courses previously offered by WACAE.

===Visual Art=== 
The Western Australian Art Gallery houses the states premier art collection and hosts numerous impressive visiting exhibitions, in 2006 the Norm Lindsay exhibition drew large crowds. 

===Performing Arts===
The [[Perth Concert Hall, Western Australia|Perth Concert Hall]] is the city's main concert venue and hosts theatre, ballet, opera and orchestral performances. Other theatres include the new (2005) Perth Convention Center, the historic His Majesty's, Burswood Dome (no longer available for musical events due to its poor design and complaints from locals about noise polution) hosts rock and popular music concerts. Outdoor concerts are held in Kings Park and Subiaco Oval and the New Convention Centre on the foreshore replaces the Burswood Dome until a more satisfactory building is established.

In 2005, the construction of the Convention Centre completed, and is now an integral feature of Perth city. Many exhibits and programs occur here, including last year's Human Body Exhibit; showing on display the human structures of Asian donors. It has been said that the Convention Centre was designed to appear to be a leaf and gum nut from a bird's eye view. However, there is still debate amongst residents as to whether or not it looks like it.

===Sport===
{{main|Sport in Western Australia}}
The climate of Perth allows for extensive outdoor sport activity, and this is reflected in the wide variety of [[sport]]s available to citizens of the city. Perth was host to the [[1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games|1962 Commonwealth Games]] and also the 1987 [[Americas Cup|America's Cup]] defence (based at [[Fremantle, Western Australia|Fremantle]]). [[Australian rules football]] is the most popular spectator sport in Perth - some 1,030,000 people attended [[Western Australian Football League|WAFL]] or [[Australian Football League|AFL]] matches in 2005.<ref>http://www.wafl.com.au/default.aspx?s=newsdisplay&aid=93746</ref> Perth has the strongest regional (State/County/Province) field hockey competition in the world. There are many field hockey clubs for children, men, women and veterans (over 40 year of age). Western Australia (especially given it only has 10% of Australia's population) hugely contributes to the national Australian men's and ladies' hockey teams which have both been winners of Olympic Gold Medals. 

Perth is home to several elite sporting teams from various sports:

*Two teams in the [[Australian Football League]] (AFL): the [[West Coast Eagles]] and the [[Fremantle Football Club]] (the "Fremantle Dockers"). The "home" of Australian Rules football in Perth is [[Subiaco Oval]]. The [[West Coast Eagles|Eagles]] won the AFL premiership in 1992, 1994 and 2006, and were runners-up in 1991 and 2005.

*A state cricket team, known as the [[Western Warriors]], who play at the [[WACA Ground]].

*A [[football (soccer)]] team, [[Perth Glory]], which is a part of the newly re-formed soccer competition known as the [[A-League]]. In the past Perth Glory have been a relatively successful team by winning the last two NSL (National Soccer League) seasons (2002-03 & 2003-04).

*A team in the [[National Basketball League (Australia)|National Basketball League]], the [[Perth Wildcats]], who are one of the most successful teams in the league's history. However, the popularity of [[basketball]] as a spectator sport in Australia has sharply declined since the early 1990s.

*A [[rugby union]] team, the [[Western Force]], in the [[Super 14]] competition. Perth also hosts the "Perth Gold" team in the [[Australian Rugby Shield]] competition. [[Rugby league]] briefly maintained a Perth team in the national competition (1995-1997), known as the [[Western Reds]] (Perth Reds in the [[Super League (Australia)|Super League]] season)

Perth also has and is currently home to numerous state and international sporting events such as:
 
*In 2002, Perth hosted the World Lacrosse Games,<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/rn/talks/8.30/sportsf/stories/s596413.htm]</ref> which included the World Lacrosse Championships (won by the United States), the Australian Youth Lacrosse Championship, a Masters (35+ year old), Grandmasters (45+), and International Open Championships.

*The 1991 and 1998 [[FINA World Championships - Long Course|FINA World Championships]] were held in Perth.

*Every year Perth hosts the [[Hopman Cup]], an international [[tennis]] tournament, generally in the first week of January. This is held at the [[Burswood Dome]], and presents Perth on an international stage.

*Perth is also home to the annual [[Avon Descent]] [[whitewater]] event, and the annual [[Telstra Rally Australia|Rally Australia]]. 

*Every summer the [[Australian cricket team]] plays a [[Test cricket|test match]] and one [[one day cricket|one day international]] match at the [[WACA Ground]]. Of the two touring teams for the one day internationals one will play two games the other will play once.

*Perth hosts the [[Gravity Games]], an international [[Surface Water Sport]] competition, annually in summer.

Perth also boasts a large river with expansive ski zones which has led to the popularisation of many [[Surface Water Sports]] such as [[Skurfing (sport)|Skurfing]], [[Wakeboarding]], [[Kiteboarding]], [[Water Skiing|Skiing]], [[Biscuiting]] to name just a few.

[[Bon Scott]] (of [[AC/DC]]) grew up in Fremantle and following his death his ashes were scattered across Fremantle Cemetery, which used to contain his headstone, until it was stolen in late 2006. Other popular music acts from Perth include [[Selwyn (singer)|Selwyn]], [[Ice Tiger]], The Farriss Brothers ([[INXS]]), [[The Dugites]], [[V-Capri]], [[The Scientists]] (including three founding [[Hoodoo Gurus]] members), [[The Manikins]], [[Johnny Diesel]], [[Baby Animals]], [[Eurogliders]], [[Dave Warner]], [[Jebediah]], [[Eskimo Joe]], [[Little Birdy]], [[The Panics]], [[The Triffids]], [[Gyroscope (band)|Gyroscope]], [[End of Fashion]], [[John Butler Trio]], [[The Sleepy Jackson]], [[Greg Packer (DJ)|Greg Packer]], [[Pendulum (drum and bass group)|Pendulum]], [[Kevin Mitchell (musician)|Bob Evans]], [[Snowman (band)|Snowman]], [[Dave Parkin]] and [[Karnivool]]. 

Perth is relatively isolated from other Australian cities so overseas artists often exclude it from their tour schedules. This isolation however has often be cited as the cause of Perth's original and alternative music. It is also for this reason that Perth is frequently called the "new Seattle", as it was [[Seattle]]'s isolation from the rest of the USA that contributed to it spawning the ground breaking [[grunge]] sound of the early 90's. The more popular [[rock concert]]s held in Perth are the [[Big Day Out]] (nationwide) and [[Rock-It]] (Perth only). The city is also the setting to the [[Pavement (band)|Pavement]] song "I Love Perth".

Perth has a very changeable and, at times, energetic [[Folk music]] culture. Bands such as The Settlers regularly played at Clancys Tavern in Fremantle and the earlier line ups of the Mucky Duck Bush Band that now has regular bush dances in [[Whiteman Park]]. A favourite spot was the Hayloft in West Perth - home of WA Folk music in the 1970s and later moving to the Peninsula hotel in [[Maylands, Western Australia|Maylands]]. Perth is also home to a vibrant alternative sexuality music scene, focused especially around such nightclubs as "the court" and "connections".

Perth is home to the [[West Australian Symphony Orchestra]] which performs a regular programme of orchestral music, usually from its base at the [[Perth Concert Hall, Western Australia|Perth Concert Hall]]; it also tours regional Western Australia. There are a large number of smaller professional, semi-professional and non-professional music groups and choral societies and choirs which perform in a variety of venues in and around Perth. Repertoire ranges from baroque to contemporary. The [[Perth International Arts Festival]] also includes music in its schedule. Opera is provided by West Australian Opera.

The West Australian Youth Music Association (or WAYMA), allows the youth of Perth to experience playing in a musical ensemble.  Acceptance is only granted to amateur student players under the age of 25 years and who are currently under instrumental tutelage.  The association runs a symphonic band, a flute choir, several choirs and four orchestras in total (two string orchestras and two symphony orchestras).

==Infrastructure==
===Transport===

[[Image:GrahamFarmerFreewayTunnel_2005_SeanMcClean.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Northbridge Tunnel on the [[Graham Farmer Freeway]]]]
Perth is served by [[Perth Airport]] in the city's east for domestic and international flights and [[Jandakot Airport]] in the city's southern suburbs for general aviation.

Perth has a road network with [[List of Freeways in Perth|three freeways]], [[List of Highways in Perth|nine metropolitan highways]] and no toll roads.

Perth metropolitan [[public transport]], including [[trains]], [[buses]] and [[ferries]], are provided by [[Transperth]], with links to rural areas provided by [[Transwa]]. There are [[List of Perth railway stations|59 railway stations]] and [[List of Perth bus stations|15 bus stations]] in the metropolitan area. The rail system is currently undergoing significant redevelopment, to be completed in 2007.

The [[Government of Western Australia]] has significantly increased metropolitan public transport funding in recent years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pta.wa.gov.au/scripts/viewarticle.asp?NID=1576|title='Let them ride buses' brigade wildly out of touch|work=Western Australian Public Transport Authority}}</ref> Initiatives include progressive replacement of the bus fleet and the [[SmartRider]] contactless [[smartcard]] ticketing system. Additionally, the rail network has been expanded in the northern and southern suburbs as part of the [[New MetroRail]] project.

The [[Indian Pacific]] passenger rail service connects Perth with [[Adelaide]] and [[Sydney]] via [[Kalgoorlie]]. The [[Transwa Prospector]] passenger rail service connects Perth with [[Kalgoorlie, Western Australia|Kalgoorlie]] via several [[Wheatbelt (Western Australia)|Wheatbelt]] towns, while the [[Transwa Australind]] connects to [[Bunbury, Western Australia|Bunbury]], and the [[Transwa Avonlink]] connects to [[Northam, Western Australia|Northam]].

Rail freight terminates at the [[Kewdale Rail Terminal]], 15 kilometres south-east of the city centre.

Perth's main container and passenger port is at [[Fremantle, Western Australia|Fremantle]], 19 kilometres south west at the mouth of the [[Swan River (Western Australia)|Swan River]].<ref>[http://www.fremantleports.com.au/Shipping/Business/PortInformation.asp Fremantle Port Information] www.fremantleports.com.au </ref>  A second port complex is being developed in [[Cockburn Sound]] primarily for the export of bulk commodities.

===Water supply===
Reduced rainfall in the region in recent years has lowered inflow to reservoirs by two-thirds over the last 30 years, and affected groundwater levels. Coupled with the city's relatively high growth rate, this had led to concerns that Perth could run out of water in the near future. The Western Australian State Government has responded by introducing mandatory household [[Irrigation sprinkler|sprinkler]] [[Water restrictions in Australia|restrictions]] in the city. In November 2006, a [[sea water]] [[desalination]] plant was opened in [[Kwinana]], able to supply over 45 [[Litre|gigalitres]]<!-- 130 megalitres per day (according to media release) = 47.5 gigalitres per year --> of potable water per year;<ref>http://www.watercorporation.com.au/m/media_detail.cfm?id=3301 Water Corporation Media Release - "Premier opens Australia's first major desalination plant"</ref><ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200609/s1748557.htm 
Kwinana desalination plant open in months]</ref> it is powered by electricity produced at the Emu Downs Wind Farm near Cervantes.<ref>http://www.watercorporation.com.au/D/desalination.cfm Water Corporation - "Perth Seawater Desalination Project"</ref> Consideration was given to piping water from the [[Kimberley region of Western Australia|Kimberley region]], however the idea was rejected in May 2006 due primarily to its high cost.<ref>[http://www.statewaterstrategy.wa.gov.au/kwsp State Water Strategy, May 2006, "Kimberley Water Source Project"] www.statewaterstrategy.wa.gov.au</ref> Other proposals being considered include extracting an extra 45 [[Litre|gigalitres]] (12 billion U.S. gallons) of water a year from the Yarragadee [[aquifer]] in the south-west, on top of water already taken from the aquifer in the metropolitan area.

==Native Title==
On 19 September 2006, the [[Federal Court of Australia]] brought down a judgment recognising Noongar [[native title]] over the Perth metropolitan area, in the case of ''Bennell v State of Western Australia'' [2006] FCA 1243.  

This is the first judgment giving a positive determination of native title over a capital city and its surrounds. Justice Wilcox found that native title continues to exist within an area in and around Perth; this is part of a larger area included in the Single Noongar Claim.  It was determined separately by the Federal Court at the request of the Commonwealth and State Government in order to obtain certainty about whether Native Title exists in the Perth metropolitan area.

An appeal was subsequently lodged and is expected to be heard in April 2007.  The remainder of the larger <U+201C>Single Noongar Claim<U+201D> remains outstanding; but it will hinge on the outcome of this appeal process.
