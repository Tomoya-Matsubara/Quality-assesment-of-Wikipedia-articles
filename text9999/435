The scion of an important noble lineage, he became one of the first and most important supporters of [[Andronikos III Palaiologos]] in his [[Byzantine civil war of 1321<U+2013>1328|struggle]] against his grandfather [[Andronikos II Palaiologos|Andronikos II]], Synadenos held various provincial governorships during Andronikos III's reign, including [[Epirus (region)|Epirus]] and [[Thessalonica]]. After the outbreak of the [[Byzantine civil war of 1341<U+2013>1347|civil war of 1341<U+2013>1347]], he tried to surrender Thessalonica to his old friend [[John Kantakouzenos]], but was driven from the city by the [[Zealots of Thessalonica]]. Forced to reconcile himself with Kantakouzenos's enemies, he was placed under house arrest in Constantinople and died impoverished in 1345/1346.

== Biography ==
Theodore Synadenos was a son of the ''[[megas stratopedarches]]'' [[John Synadenos (megas stratopedarches)|John Synadenos]] and [[Theodora Palaiologina Synadene|Theodora Palaiologina]], the niece of Emperor [[Michael VIII Palaiologos]] (r. 1259<U+2013>1282), and hence a member of the [[Byzantine Empire]]'s highest aristocracy. He had a, probably older, brother also named [[John Synadenos (megas konostaulos)|John]], and at least one sister, Euphrosyne.<ref name="ODB">Kazhdan (1991), p. 1990</ref><ref>Polemis (1968), pp. 178<U+2013>181</ref> Little is known about his early life: he was born ca. 1277, and apparently lived at [[Bizye]] on the [[Black Sea]] coast of [[Thrace]], where he had extensive estates.<ref name="P181">Polemis (1968), p. 181</ref>

=== Under Andronikos III ===
[[File:Andronikos III Palaiologos.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Andronikos III Palaiologos]]
Synadenos was a close friend to his cousin, the junior emperor [[Michael IX Palaiologos]], but after Michael's death in 1320, Michael's father, the old emperor [[Andronikos II Palaiologos|Andronikos II]] (r. 1282<U+2013>1328), distrusting his loyalty, sent him to the border with [[Medieval Serbia|Serbia]], as governor of [[Prilep]].<ref>Nicol (1993), p. 156</ref><ref name="B87">Bartusis (1997), p. 87</ref> It was in this position that Syandenos became one of the earliest and most important supporters around Michael IX's son, the young [[Andronikos III Palaiologos|Andronikos III]] (r. 1328<U+2013>1341), who had been disinherited by Andronikos II after Michael's death. Along with the fellow aristocrats [[John Kantakouzenos]] and [[Syrgiannes Palaiologos]], Theodore formed the leading "triumvirate" of Andronikos III's supporters, to which the "[[novus homo|new man]]" [[Alexios Apokaukos]] attached himself as a junior member.<ref name="B87"/><ref>Nicol (1993), pp. 155<U+2013>156</ref> In the first round of the [[Byzantine civil war of 1321<U+2013>1328|civil war]] between grandfather and grandson, Andronikos III was successful in getting recognition for himself as junior emperor, with Thrace as his province.<ref>Nicol (1993), pp. 157<U+2013>158</ref><ref>Bartusis (1997), pp. 87<U+2013>88</ref> For his services, Synadenos secured the court rank of ''[[domestikos tes trapezes]]'', and was soon after promoted to ''[[protostrator]]''.<ref name="PLP"/><ref name="P181"/> In the final round of the civil war, in 1327<U+2013>1328, Synadenos served as governor in Thrace.<ref name="PLP"/> As more and more localities, including the Empire's second-most important city, [[Thessalonica]], switched over to Andronikos III's camp, Synadenos along with Kantakouzenos urged Andronikos III to march on [[Constantinople]] and depose his grandfather outright. On the night of 13 May, the three men led their army through a gate after bribing its guard, taking possession of the imperial capital without resistance.<ref>Nicol (1993), pp. 159<U+2013>161</ref><ref>Bartusis (1997), p. 91</ref>

Theodore Synadenos was rewarded by being made [[Eparch of Constantinople]], Apokaukos became head of the imperial secretariat, Kantakouzenos remained Andronikos III's principal advisor as ''[[megas domestikos]]'', and Syrgiannes was named governor of Thessalonica.<ref>Nicol (1993), p. 168</ref> In ca. 1330, Synadenos was sent as governor to [[Mesembria]], while in 1336, after Andronikos III and [[John Kantakouzenos]] annexed [[Despotate of Epirus|Epirus]], he became its governor.<ref name="PLP"/><ref name="P181"/><ref>Nicol (1993), p. 181</ref> In late 1338, however, a revolt broke out in Epirus in favour of [[Nikephoros II Orsini]], the last descendant of the Epirote ruling dynasty. Synadenos was taken captive in the capital, [[Arta, Greece|Arta]] by the rebels, and remained a prisoner until 1340, when Andronikos III and Kantakouzenos campaigned against the rebels and recovered the region. [[John Angelos (sebastokrator)|John Angelos]], a relative of Kantakouzenos, was installed as the new governor, while Synadenos was moved to the governorship of Thessalonica.<ref name="P181"/><ref>Nicol (1993), pp. 181<U+2013>182</ref><ref>Bartusis (1997), p. 93</ref>

=== Renewed civil war and death ===
[[File:Johannes VI. Cantacuzenos.jpg|thumb|right|180px|John VI Kantakouzenos]]
In June 1341, Andronikos III died suddenly, and a power struggle developed between Kantakouzenos, who initially assumed the powers of regency over Andronikos's underage son [[John V Palaiologos]], and a powerful faction around the Patriarch [[John XIV Kalekas]], the Empress-dowager [[Anna of Savoy]] and Alexios Apokaukos on the other. The dispute soon developed in outright conflict when the Patriarch the Empress and Apokaukos replaced Kantakouzenos as regent and imprisoned his family and supporters. In response, Kantakouzenos proclaimed himself emperor at [[Didymoteichon]] in October.<ref>Nicol (1993), pp. 190<U+2013>191</ref><ref>Bartusis (1997), pp. 94<U+2013>95</ref> The news of Kantakouzenos's proclamation sparked a wave of popular resistance across [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] and Thrace. The common people, impoverished by an exploitative and over-powerful aristocracy, viewed Kantakouzenos as a representative of the hated aristocrats and rallied behind the legitimate Palaiologos line and one by one, the cities were seized in the name of the Constantinopolitan regency.<ref>Nicol (1993), pp. 191<U+2013>194</ref><ref name="B95">Bartusis (1997), p. 95</ref> Thessalonica at first remained tranquil, and Synadenos contacted his old friend Kantakouzenos with the intention of surrendering the city to him. Such a move might well prove decisive, as possession of Thessalonica would enable Kantakouzenos to control Macedonia, [[Thessaly]] and Epirus, and in March 1342, he set out from Didymoteichon with his army in the direction of the city. Before he arrived there, however, Synadenos was overthrown and driven from the city by a rebellion led by a radical popular faction, the [[Zealots of Thessalonica|Zealots]].<ref name="B95"/><ref>Nicol (1993), p. 194</ref> Apokaukos with a fleet came to reinforce the new regime, and one of his sons was installed as its new governor.<ref name="B95"/><ref>Nicol (1993), pp. 194<U+2013>195</ref>

Driven from Thessalonica, with Kantakouzenos's cause seemingly in ruins<U+2014>he was soon forced to seek refuge in the court of the Serbian king, [[Stefan Dushan]]<U+2014>and with his family back in Constantinople in the regency's hands, Synadenos made terms with Apokaukos.<ref name="B95"/><ref>Nicol (1993), p. 195</ref> He was rewarded with the high rank of ''[[protovestiarios]]'', but soon after placed under virtual house arrest in Constantinople. There he died, deprived of his court rank and considerable wealth, in late 1345 or early 1346.<ref name="PLP"/><ref name="P181"/> A year later, in February 1347, Kantakouzenos entered Constantinople as the victor of the disastrous civil war.<ref>Nicol (1993), pp. 205<U+2013>207</ref><ref>Bartusis (1997), pp. 96<U+2013>97</ref>

===Family===
Some time before 1320, Theodore married Eudokia Doukaina Komnene Palaiologina Synadene, and had two daughters:<ref name="PLP"/><ref>Polemis (1968), pp. 181, 182</ref>
* Theodora Komnene Doukaina Raoulaina Palaiologina, who probably married a member of the [[Raoul]] family.
* Anna Komnene Doukaina Palaiologina Asanina, who married John Kantakouzenos' brother-in-law, [[Manuel Asen]].
