'''Dorothee S<U+00F6>lle''' ([[September 30]], [[1929]] - [[April 27]], [[2003]]) was a socially-engaged [[Germany|German]] theologian and writer.  She died at a congress in [[G<U+00F6>ppingen]], [[Germany]].

Dorothee S<U+00F6>lle studied theology, philosophy and literature at the [[University of Cologne]], earning a doctorate with a thesis on the connections between theology and poetry. She taught briefly in [[Aachen]] before returning to [[Cologne]] as a university lecturer. She became active in politics, speaking out against the [[Vietnam War]], the [[arms race]] of the [[Cold War]] and injustices in the [[developing world]]. Notably, from 1968 to 1972 she organized Cologne's [[Politisches Nachtgebet]] (political night-prayers). Between 1975 and 1987, she spent six months a year at [[Union Theological Seminary]] in [[New York City]], where she was a professor of systematic theology. Although she never held a professorship in [[Germany]], she received an honorary professorship from the [[University of Hamburg]] in 1994.

She wrote a large number of books, including ''The Silent Cry: Mysticism and Resistance'' (2001) and her autobiography ''Against the Wind: Memoir of a Radical Christian'' (1999).  Perhaps her best-known work in English was "Suffering," which offers a critique of "Christian masochism" and "theological sadism."  Solle's critique is against the assumption that God is all-powerful and the cause of suffering; humans thus suffer for some greater purpose.  Instead, God suffers and is powerless alongside us.  Humans are to struggle together against oppression, sexism, anti-Semitism, and other forms of authoritarianism.  

S<U+00F6>lle was married twice and had four children. First, in 1954 she married the artist [[Dietrich S<U+00F6>lle]], whom she divorced in 1964. In 1969, she married former Benedictine monk [[Fullbert Steffensky]], with whom she organized the [[Politisches Nachtgebet]].
