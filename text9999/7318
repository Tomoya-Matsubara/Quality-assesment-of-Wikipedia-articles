'''Gary Michael Null''' (born in 1945) is an [[United States|American]] [[talk radio]] host and [[author]] on [[alternative medicine|alternative and complementary medicine]] and [[nutrition]]. On his [[talk radio]] show and in his books and self-produced movies, Null has criticized the medical community, promoted a range of [[alternative cancer treatment]]s and [[dietary supplement]]s, and [[AIDS denialism|questioned the link between HIV and AIDS]].

In 2010, Null reported that he had been poisoned and nearly killed by ingesting one of his own dietary supplements, "Gary Null's Ultimate Power Meal". Null sued a contractor involved in producing the supplement, alleging that it contained more than 1,000 times the dose of [[vitamin D]] reported on the label, leading to the hospitalization of Null and six other consumers with [[hypervitaminosis D|vitamin poisoning]].<ref name="ny-post"/><ref name="abc-news"/><ref name="la-times"/>

==Early life and education==
Null was raised in [[Parkersburg]], [[West Virginia]], with his two brothers. He holds an [[Associate Degree]] in [[Business Administration]] as well as a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree from [[Thomas Edison State College]] in [[Trenton, New Jersey]]. He received a [[Ph.D.]] in Interdisciplinary Studies from [[Union Institute & University]], a private [[Distance education|distance-learning]] college in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]].<ref name="union-phd">{{cite news | work = [[Cincinnati Enquirer]] | title = Union Institute rules get stricter  | first = Kristina | last = Goetz | date = March 27, 2004 | accessdate = June 23, 2011}}</ref> Null's thesis was entitled "A Study of Psychological and Physiological Effects of Caffeine on Human Health." His credentials and the rigor of his Ph.D. program were questioned by [[Stephen Barrett]] of [[Quackwatch]].<ref name="null-qw">{{cite web | publisher = [[Quackwatch]] | first = Stephen | last = Barrett | authorlink = Stephen Barrett | title = A Critical Look at Gary Null's Activities and Credentials | url = http://www.quackwatch.org/04ConsumerEducation/null.html | date = May 12, 2010 | accessdate= June 23, 2011}}</ref>  Null is a New York State Certified dietitian-nutritionist.<ref name="License">{{cite web | title = License Information | url = http://www.nysed.gov/coms/op001/opscr2?profcd=48&plicno=003731 | publisher = NY State Education Department - Office of the Professions | date = 1996-03-21 | accessdate = 2012-04-23 }}</ref>

==Viewpoints==
Null attacks many facets of mainstream medicine, arguing that physicians have an economic interest in promoting rather than preventing sickness. In the 1970s, Null co-authored a series of articles on cancer research for ''[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]'', beginning with one entitled "The Great Cancer Fraud."<ref>Null's articles on alternative cancer therapies in ''Penthouse'' include:
* {{cite journal | first = Gary | last = Null | coauthors = Robert Houston | title = The Great Cancer Fraud | journal = [[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]] | year = 1979 | pages = 76&ndash;78, 82, 268, 270, 272, 274, 276&ndash;278}}
* {{cite journal | first = Gary | last = Null | coauthors = A. Pitrone | title = Suppression of new cancer therapies: Dr. Joseph Gold and hydrazine sulfate | journal = [[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]] | year = 1980 | pages = 97&ndash;98, 160, 162&ndash;163}}
* {{cite journal | first = Gary | last = Null | coauthors = L. Steinman | title = The politics of cancer. Part five. Suppression of new cancer therapies: Dr. Lawrence Burton | journal = [[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]] | year = 1980 | pages = 75&ndash;76, 188&ndash;194, 196&ndash;197}}</ref> In ''Penthouse'', Null accused the medical community of "suppressing alternative cancer treatments to protect the medical establishment's solid-gold cancer train." In place of standard medical therapy, Null advocated [[alternative cancer treatment]]s such as [[hydrazine sulfate]]. In 1999 ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]'' wrote of Null's [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy claims]]: "From a young reporter this is to be expected. But two decades later, Null, 54, is still warning of a variety of medical bogeymen out to gull a trusting public."<ref name="time">{{cite news | title = The New Mister Natural | url =  http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,990975,00.html | work = [[Time (magazine)|TIME]] | date = May 17, 1999 | accessdate= June 23, 2011 | first = Alice | last = Park | coauthors = Jeffrey Kluger}}</ref>

In addition to his promotion of alternative cancer treatments, Null has argued that [[HIV]] is harmless and does not cause [[AIDS]].<ref name="time"/> In his book ''AIDS: A Second Opinion'', Null questioned the role of [[antiretroviral medication]] and instead advocated a range of [[dietary supplement]]s for HIV-positive individuals. His book was criticized as "massive, irresponsible and nearly unreadable" by [[Salon.com]],<ref name="salon">{{cite web | publisher = [[Salon.com]] | first = Peter | last = Kurth | title = Quack record | date = May 21, 2002 | accessdate = June 23, 2011 | url = http://dir.salon.com/books/feature/2002/05/21/null/index.html}}</ref> and [[Seth Kalichman]] cited Null as a prominent proponent of [[AIDS denialism]], cashing in on HIV/AIDS and repeating the claims of other denialists.  Kalichman compared Null's activities to [[Holocaust denial]] and stated that Null was an example of a dangerous entrepreneur who "obviously breached" the balance between free speech versus protecting [[public health]].<ref name="denying-aids">{{cite book | first = S | last = Kalichman | authorlink = Seth Kalichman | title = Denying AIDS | publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | isbn = 978-0-387-79475-4 | year = 2009 | pages = [http://books.google.ca/books?id=_mtDBCDwxugC&pg=PA12#v=onepage&q&f=false 12]; [http://books.google.ca/books?id=_mtDBCDwxugC&pg=PA89#v=onepage&q&f=false 89] }}</ref>

In 2009, Null was the keynote speaker at a rally opposing mandatory [[H1N1 influenza]] vaccination during the [[2009 flu pandemic|2009 pandemic]], leading the state health department to dismiss Null's claims about the vaccine as "not scientifically credible."<ref name="h1n1-vaccine">{{cite news | work = Legislative Gazette | first = Charles | last = Scribona | title = Health workers angry over mandatory swine flu shots | url = http://www.legislativegazette.com/Articles-c-2009-11-02-55041.113122-Health-workers-angry-over-mandatory-swine-flu-shots.html | date = November 2, 2009 | accessdate = June 23, 2011}}</ref>

==Radio and video work==
Null began broadcasting a syndicated radio talk show, ''Natural Living with Gary Null'' in 1980.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} His show was broadcast first on [[WBAI]], then on the VoiceAmerica Network and over the internet. Null's show subsequently returned to WBAI, leading to protests from [[AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power|ACT-UP New York]] and other AIDS activist groups concerned by Null's promotion of AIDS denialism.<ref name="act-up">{{cite web | publisher = [[AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power|ACT-UP]] | title = Letter to Indra Hardat, interim general manager, WBAI/Pacifica | url = http://www.actupny.org/reports/denialist_gary_null.html | date = January 17, 2006 | accessdate = June 23, 2011}}</ref><ref name="aidstruth-wbai">{{cite web | publisher = aidstruth.org | title = WBAI: Do not put Gary Null's dangerous show on the air | url = http://www.aidstruth.org/news/2010/wbai-do-not-put-gary-nulls-dangerous-show-air-sign | date = November 17, 2010 | accessdate = June 23, 2011}}</ref> 

Null has made several self-funded and self-produced [[documentary film]]s on [[public policy]] issues, personal health, and development.  His videos have been aired by [[PBS]] during pledge drives, but concern arose within PBS over the videos' sensational claims. Ervin Duggan, the president of PBS, expressed concern that by showing Null's videos, the network was "open[ing] the door to quacks and charlatans."<ref>{{cite web | last = Bedford  | first = Karen Everhart | title = Gary Null special sparks debate on pledge program standards | work = [[Current (newspaper)|Current]] | date = January 25, 1999 | url = http://www.current.org/mo/mo901n.html | accessdate = January 19, 2009}}</ref> Null implied that his problems with PBS may have been an attempt to silence him, saying: "The guardians of the gates of orthodoxy at PBS... you don't know who their friends are."<ref name="time"/>

==Dietary supplements and vitamin poisoning==
Null owns Gary Null & Associates, a company that markets [[dietary supplement]]s, as well as a health-food store in [[New York City]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Gary Null's Uptown Whole Foods | url = http://www.nysite.com/westside/b9/uptownwf.htm}}</ref> In 2010, Null claimed that he was sickened and nearly killed by his own dietary supplements.<ref name="ny-post">{{cite news | work = [[New York Post]] | title = Health guru nearly killed eating own product | url = http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/health_guru_nearly_killed_eating_hGIit27zRFN0UP3eMLWgKL | first = Dareh | last = Gregorian | date = April 28, 2010 | accessdate = June 23, 2011}}</ref><ref name="la-times">{{cite news | work = [[Los Angeles Times]] | title = Supplements guru sues over his own product | url = http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/booster_shots/2010/04/supplements-guru-sues-over-his-own-product.html | date = April 29, 2010 | accessdate = June 23, 2011 | first = Melissa | last = Healy}}</ref><ref name="abc-news">{{cite news | publisher = [[ABC News]] | title = Alternative Health Guru Sues Company Over His Own Product | first = Cleopatra | last = Andreadis | date = April 29, 2010 | accessdate = June 23, 2011 | url = http://abcnews.go.com/TheLaw/Health/alternative-health-guru-sues-company-product-claiming-killed/story?id=10499409}}</ref>  He filed suit against a contractor involved in producing the supplement, "Gary Null's Ultimate Power Meal", claiming that the supplement contained 1,000 times the labeled dose of [[Vitamin D]] and that it had led to the hospitalizations of 6 consumers [[Hypervitaminosis D|poisoned by excessive doses of the vitamin]].<ref name="ny-post"/> Null reportedly suffered severe pain and kidney damage from "Gary Null's Ultimate Power Meal", but continued consuming the supplement in the belief that it would relieve his symptoms.<ref name="ny-post"/>

The ''[[New York Post]]'' noted that Null's near-death experience with his own supplement brand was "not exactly a ringing endorsement."<ref name="ny-post"/> The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote that Null's experience "should give pause to anyone lured by the extravagant claims of many supplements makers", and noted that it was common for dietary supplements to contain doses "wildly different than those indicated on their label" as a result of [[Dietary supplement#Regulation|weak regulation]].<ref name="la-times"/> Null's attorney cast the alleged vitamin poisoning as an isolated incident, saying: "We don't want anything to affect the physical well-being of anyone or the reputation of the company."<ref name="abc-news"/>
