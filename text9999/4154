'''RoyEl Wilfred Wooten''' (born [[October 13]], [[1957]] in [[Hampton, Virginia|Hampton]], [[Virginia]]) better known by his [[stage name]] '''Future Man''' (also spelled as '''Futureman'''), is an [[inventor]], [[musician]], and [[composer]].  He is known as '''Futch''' to his fans.<ref name=graham>{{cite news |first=Jefferson |last=Graham |title=What IS that thing? Futureman explains the Drumitar |url=http://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/techinnovations/2004-08-05-drumitar_x.htm |work=[[USA Today]] |publisher=[[Gannett Company]] |location=Deer Valley, [[Utah]] |date=2004-08-06 |accessdate=2008-02-15 }}</ref>  He is a [[percussion]]ist and member of the [[jazz]] quartet [[B<U+00E9>la Fleck and the Flecktones]].  The other members are [[banjo]]ist [[B<U+00E9>la Fleck]], [[saxophone|saxophonist]] [[Jeff Coffin]], and RoyEl's brother, [[Bass guitar|electric bass]] [[virtuoso]] [[Victor Wooten]].

==Biography==
Roy Wooten was raised in a military family and therefore traveled frequently.  He is the second of five sons born to Dorothy and Elijah "Pete" Wooten.  He graduated from Denbigh High School in [[Newport News, Virginia]] in 1975.  He briefly attended music classes at [[Norfolk State University]] upon graduating from high school, and then embarked on his professional music career.  He and his brothers moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], [[Tennessee]] in the mid-1980s.

All of his brothers are musicians.  The oldest, Regi, is a guitarist and much sought-after teacher in Nashville.  Roy Wooten, Regi, and his three younger brothers, Rudy ([[saxophone]]), Joseph ([[Musical keyboard|keyboards]]), and Victor (bass guitar), performed as The Wooten Brothers in numerous musical venues in the [[Hampton Roads]] area of southeast Virginia during the 1970s.

Wooten is a two-time [[Grammy Award]]-winning performer with [[B<U+00E9>la Fleck and the Flecktones]]. For the Flecktones, he plays the [[Drumitar]], a novel electronic instrument of his own invention.

More recently, Wooten has developed a new electronic instrument called the RoyEl,<ref name=templeton>{{cite news |first=David |last=Templeton |title=Weird Science |url=http://www.metroactive.com/papers/sonoma/03.29.01/futuremen-0113.html |work=[[Metro Silicon Valley|Metroactive]] |publisher=[[Metro Newspapers]] |date=2001-04-02 |accessdate=2008-02-15 }}</ref> which resembles a [[piano]] but plays notes not found in the traditional western music scales.  This instrument is based on the [[periodic table|periodic table of elements]]<ref name=templeton/> and the [[golden ratio]].

==Solo work==

Like the other members of the Flecktones, Future Man has worked on various solo projects during his time off from the band. On his own Wooten often dresses up as a pirate and uses the pseudonym "RoyEl", the name he gave to the keyboard instrument he invented.  Future Man's solo albums are [[experimental music|experimental]] and incorporate diverse musical genres and concepts.  On ''Evolution de la Musique'', for example, he infuses [[european classical music|classical music]] with jazz elements, especially [[improvisation]], and [[spoken word]].  Future Man's solo works are:

*''The Seamless Script''
*''Pi Lullaby''
*''Evolution de la Musique''
*''The Black Mozart Ensemble''

==Tax evasion==
In November 2001, Wooten was indicted on four counts of [[tax evasion]], for the years 1995 to 1998. His defense in 2004 involved many implausible assertions. He claimed, for example, that the [[Internal Revenue Service]] is a debt collector based in [[Puerto Rico]]. He also used esoteric and arcane [[tax protester]] literature.

The court ordered a competency evaluation and postponed the trial. On [[May 4]], [[2005]], Future Man [[Plea|pled]] guilty to one count of tax evasion; however, his reason for not paying taxes was "I don't need to pay taxes, I'm from the future." He was sentenced on [[August 8]], [[2005]] to two years [[probation]] and was ordered to pay $131,000 in back [[taxes]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rothcpa.com/archives/001215.php#001215 |title=Futureman Gets His Future Back |accessdate=2008-02-15 |last=Kristan |first=Joe |date=2005-08-16 |work=Tax Update Blog }}</ref>
