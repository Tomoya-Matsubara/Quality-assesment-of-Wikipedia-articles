'''Bron-Yr-Aur''' ([[Welsh language|Welsh]] for "golden hill", "breast of the gold" or "hill of the gold"; {{IPA-cy|br<U+0254>n.<U+0259>r.a<U+026A>r}}), sometimes misspelled as '''Bron-Y-Aur''', is a privately owned 18th-century [[cottage]], on the outskirts of [[Machynlleth]], [[Wales]], and best known for its association with the English rock band [[Led Zeppelin]].

==Overview==
The cottage was used during the 1950s by the family of future-Led Zeppelin vocalist [[Robert Plant]] as a holiday home.<ref name="Sutcliffe_Q">Phil Sutcliffe, "Back to Nature", ''Q Magazine'' Special Led Zeppelin edition, 2003, p. 34.</ref><ref name=williamson>Nigel Williamson, "Good Times...Bad Times", ''[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]'', May 2005, p. 54.</ref> In 1970, Plant and guitarist [[Jimmy Page]] spent time there after a long and gruelling [[Led Zeppelin North American Tour Spring 1970|concert tour of North America]]. Though the cottage had no running water or electricity, they used it as a [[Retreat (spiritual)|retreat]] to write and record some of their third album, ''[[Led Zeppelin III]]''. People at the cottage during this time were Plant's wife Maureen and 18-month-old daughter Carmen, Page's girlfriend Charlotte Martin, and Led Zeppelin [[road crew|roadies]] Clive Coulson and Sandy MacGregor.

Page has explained that:
{{quote|Robert (Plant) and I went to Bron-Yr-Aur in 1970. We'd been working solidly right up to that point. Even recordings were done on the road. We had this time off and Robert suggested the cottage. I certainly hadn't been to that area of Wales. So we took our guitars down there and played a few bits and pieces. This wonderful countryside, panoramic views and having the guitars ... it was just an automatic thing to be playing. And we started writing.<ref name="Uncut09"><U+201C>I first met Jimmy on Tolworth Broadway, holding a bag of exotic fish...<U+201D>, ''[[Uncut magazine|Uncut]]'', January 2009, p. 43.</ref>}}

According to the guitarist, the time spent at Bron-Yr-Aur in 1970
{{quote|...was the first time I really came to know Robert [Plant]. Actually living together at Bron-Yr-Aur, as opposed to occupying nearby hotel rooms. The songs took us into areas that changed the band, and it established a standard of travelling for inspiration... which is the best thing a musician can do.<ref name=complete>Liner notes by [[Cameron Crowe]] for ''[[The Complete Studio Recordings (Led Zeppelin album)|The Complete Studio Recordings]]''</ref>}}

Led Zeppelin songs which can be traced to Plant and Page's time at Bron-Yr-Aur in 1970 include "[[Over the Hills and Far Away (Led Zeppelin song)|Over the Hills and Far Away]]" and "[[The Crunge]]" (both from ''[[Houses of the Holy]]''), "[[The Rover (song)|The Rover]]", "[[Bron-Yr-Aur (instrumental)|Bron-Yr-Aur]]" and "[[Down by the Seaside]]" (from ''[[Physical Graffiti]]''), "[[Poor Tom]]" (from ''[[Coda (album)|Coda]]'') and three they actually used on ''Led Zeppelin III'': "[[Friends (Led Zeppelin song)|Friends]]", "[[Bron-Y-Aur Stomp]]" and "[[That's the Way (Led Zeppelin song)|That's the Way]]". There were also two songs recorded, called "Another Way To Wales" and "I Wanna Be Her Man", which never found their way onto an official Led Zeppelin album.<ref name="Sutcliffe_Q" /> A primitive recording of the latter of these can however be heard on [[bootleg recording|bootleg]] label Antrabata's studio outtakes sessions.<ref>[http://stryder.de/outtakes_sessions.html Led Zeppelin Live - Outtakes Rehearsels Soundchecks<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

When on-stage for [[Page and Plant]]'s ''[[No Quarter: Jimmy Page and Robert Plant Unledded|Unledded]]'' reunion in 1994, Plant announced to the audience that Page's daughter, [[Scarlet Page]], was conceived "about half an hour" after "That's the Way" was written at Bron-Yr-Aur.<ref name="Sutcliffe_Q" />

Led Zeppelin used the name of the house in the title of their songs: "[[Bron-Y-Aur Stomp]]" (the name of the house being accidentally misspelled  on the album cover), and "[[Bron-Yr-Aur (instrumental)|Bron-Yr-Aur]]". "Bron-Y-Aur Stomp" is a [[country music]] inflected [[hoedown]] on ''[[Led Zeppelin III]]'', in which Robert Plant waxes lyrical about walking in the woods with Strider, his blue eyed [[Merle (coat colour in dogs)|merle]] dog. Contrastingly, "Bron-Yr-Aur" is a gentle, acoustic instrumental by Page on the [[guitar|six-string guitar]], which appeared on the later album ''[[Physical Graffiti]]'' and in the film ''[[The Song Remains the Same (film)|The Song Remains the Same]]''.

"Bron-Y-Aur" is also the name of the secret instrumental track at the end of ''[[Good Apollo, I'm Burning Star IV, Volume One: From Fear Through the Eyes of Madness]]'', the third album from [[Coheed and Cambria]]. The track has a similar sound to the Led Zeppelin song of the same title.
