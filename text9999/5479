'''<U+00C6>lfheah''' (954 <U+2013> 19 April 1012; {{lang-ang|<U+00C6>lfh<U+0113>ah}}, "elf-high"), officially remembered by the name '''Alphege''' within the Church, and also called '''Elphege''', '''Alfege''', or '''Godwine''', was an [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] [[Bishop of Winchester]], later [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. He became an [[anchorite]] before being elected abbot of [[Bath Abbey]].  His perceived piety and sanctity led to his promotion to the [[episcopate]], and eventually, to his becoming archbishop. <U+00C6>lfheah furthered the cult of [[Dunstan|St Dunstan]] and also encouraged learning. He was captured by [[Viking]] raiders in 1011 and killed by them the following year after refusing to allow himself to be ransomed. <U+00C6>lfheah was [[Canonization|canonized]] as a [[saint]] in 1078. [[Thomas Becket]], a later Archbishop of Canterbury, prayed to him just before his own murder in [[Canterbury Cathedral]].

==Life==
Reportedly born in [[Weston, Bath|Weston]] on the outskirts of Bath,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.saintalphege.org.uk/4saint.html |title=Alphege, Saint and Martyr |publisher=St. Alphege's Church, Bath}} Accessed 14 August 2009</ref> <U+00C6>lfheah became a monk early in life. He first entered the monastery of [[Deerhurst]], but then moved to [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], where he became an anchorite. He was noted for his piety and austerity, and rose to become [[abbot]] of Bath Abbey.<ref name=Knowles>Knowles, et al. ''Heads of Religious Houses, England and Wales'' pp. 28, 241</ref> Probably due to the influence of [[Dunstan]], the Archbishop of Canterbury (959<U+2013>988), <U+00C6>lfheah was elected [[Bishop of Winchester]] in 984,<ref name=Handbook223>Fryde, et al. ''Handbook of British Chronology'' p. 223</ref><ref name=1000Church109>Barlow ''English Church 1000<U+2013>1066'' p. 109 footnote 5</ref> and was consecrated on 19&nbsp;October that year.<ref name=DNB/> While bishop he was largely responsible for the construction of a large [[Pipe organ|organ]] in the [[Old Minster, Winchester|cathedral]], audible from over a mile away and said to require more than 24&nbsp;men to operate. He also built and enlarged the city's churches,<ref name=Hindley304>Hindley ''A Brief History of the Anglo-Saxons'' pp. 304<U+2013>305</ref> and promoted the cult of St [[Swithun]] and Swithun's predecessor, [[<U+00C6>thelwold of Winchester]].<ref name=DNB/>

Following a Viking raid in 994, a peace treaty was agreed with one of the raiders, [[Olaf I of Norway|Olaf Tryggvason]]. Besides receiving [[danegeld]], Olaf converted to Christianity<ref name=ASE378>Stenton ''Anglo-Saxon England'' p. 378</ref> and undertook never to raid or fight the English again.<ref name=Williams47>Williams ''<U+00C6>thelred the Unready'' p. 47</ref> <U+00C6>lfheah may have played a part in the treaty negotiations, and it is certain that he confirmed Olaf in his new faith.<ref name=DNB>Leyser "[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/181 <U+00C6>lfheah (d. 1012) (subscription required)]" ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''</ref>

In 1006 <U+00C6>lfheah succeeded [[<U+00C6>lfric of Abingdon|<U+00C6>lfric]] as [[Archbishop of Canterbury]],<ref name=Saints>Walsh ''A New Dictionary of Saints'' p. 28</ref><ref name=Handbook214>Fryde, et al. ''Handbook of British Chronology'' p. 214</ref> taking St Swithun's head with him as a [[relic]] for the new location.<ref name=DNB/> He went to Rome in 1007 to receive his [[pallium]]<U+2014>symbol of his ties to the [[Apostolic See]]<U+2014>from [[Pope John XVIII]], but was robbed during his journey.<ref name=1000Church299>Barlow ''English Church 1000<U+2013>1066'' pp. 298<U+2013>299 footnote 7</ref><ref>Schoenig "Bonds of Wool" ''America: The National Catholic Weekly'' p. 19</ref> While at Canterbury he promoted the cult of St Dunstan,<ref name=DNB/> ordering the writing of the second ''Life of Dunstan'', which Adelard composed between 1006 and 1011.<ref name=1000Church62>Barlow ''English Church 1000<U+2013>1066'' p. 62</ref> He also introduced new practices into the liturgy, and was instrumental in the [[Witenagemot]]'s recognition of [[Wulfsige III|Wulfsige of Sherborne]] as a saint in about 1012.<ref name=1000Church223>Barlow ''English Church 1000<U+2013>1066'' p. 223</ref>

<U+00C6>lfheah sent [[<U+00C6>lfric of Eynsham]] to [[Cerne Abbey]] to take charge of its monastic school.<ref name=ASE458>Stenton ''Anglo-Saxon England'' p. 458</ref> He was present at the council of May 1008 at which [[Wulfstan II|Wulfstan II, Archbishop of York]], preached his ''[[Sermo Lupi ad Anglos]]'' (''The Sermon of the Wolf to the English''), castigating the English for their moral failings and blaming the latter for the tribulations afflicting the country.<ref name=Fletcher94>Fletcher ''Bloodfeud'' p. 94</ref>

In 1011 the [[Viking|Danes]] again raided England, and from 8<U+2013>29 September they laid siege to Canterbury. Aided by the treachery of <U+00C6>lfmaer, whose life <U+00C6>lfheah had once saved, the raiders succeeded in sacking the city.<ref name=Williams106>Williams ''<U+00C6>thelred the Unready'' pp. 106<U+2013>107</ref>{{#tag:ref|How exactly <U+00C6>lfheah had saved <U+00C6>lfmaer's life is not recorded in any source.<ref name=DNB/>|group=notes}} <U+00C6>lfheah was taken prisoner and held captive for seven months.<ref name=Hindley301>Hindley ''A Brief History of the Anglo-Saxons'' p. 301</ref> [[Godwine I|Godwine]] ([[Bishop of Rochester]]), [[Leofrun]] (abbess of St Mildrith's), and the king's [[Reeve (England)|reeve]], <U+00C6>lfweard were captured also, but the abbot of [[St Augustine's Abbey]], [[<U+00C6>lfmaer]], managed to escape.<ref name=Williams106/> [[Canterbury Cathedral]] was plundered and burned by the Danes following <U+00C6>lfheah's capture.<ref name=1000Church209>Barlow ''English Church 1000<U+2013>1066'' pp. 209<U+2013>210</ref>

==Death==
<U+00C6>lfheah refused to allow a ransom to be paid for his freedom, and as a result was killed on 19&nbsp;April 1012 at [[Greenwich]]<ref name=Hindley301/> (then in [[Kent]], now [[London]]), reputedly on the site of [[St Alfege Church, Greenwich|St Alfege's Church]].<ref name=Saints/><ref name=Handbook214/> The account of <U+00C6>lfheah's death appears in the E version of the [[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]: {{quote|... the raiding-army became much stirred up against the bishop, because he did not want to offer them any money, and forbade that anything might be granted in return for him. Also they were very drunk, because there was wine brought from the south. Then they seized the bishop, led him to their "hustings"{{#tag:ref|"Hustings" derives from an Old Norse word that has the meaning of assembly or council, so there may have been some sort of trial that condemned <U+00C6>lfheah.<ref name=ASC/>|group=notes}} on the Saturday in the octave of Easter, and then pelted him there with bones and the heads of cattle; and one of them struck him on the head with the butt of an axe, so that with the blow he sank down and his holy blood fell on the earth, and sent forth his holy soul to God's kingdom.<ref name=ASC>Swanton ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' p. 142</ref>}}

<U+00C6>lfheah was the first Archbishop of Canterbury to die a violent death.<ref name=Fletcher78>Fletcher ''Bloodfeud'' p. 78</ref> A contemporary report tells that [[Thorkell the Tall]] attempted to save <U+00C6>lfheah from the mob about to kill him by offering them everything he owned except for his ship, in exchange for <U+00C6>lfheah's life; Thorkell's presence is not mentioned in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, however.<ref name=Williams109>Williams ''<U+00C6>thelred the Unready'' pp. 109<U+2013>110</ref> Some sources record that the final blow, with the back of an axe, was delivered as an [[Coup de gr<U+00E2>ce|act of kindness]] by a Christian convert known as "Thrum."  <U+00C6>lfheah was buried in [[St Paul's Cathedral]].<ref name=DNB/> In 1023 his body was moved by [[Canute the Great|King Canute]] to [[Canterbury]], with great ceremony.<ref name=Hindley309>Hindley ''A Brief History of the Anglo-Saxons'' pp. 309<U+2013>310</ref> Thorkell the Tall was appalled at the brutality of his fellow raiders, and switched sides to the English king [[<U+00C6>thelred the Unready]] following <U+00C6>lfheah's death.<ref name=ASE383>Stenton ''Anglo-Saxon England'' p. 383</ref>

[[Pope Gregory VII]] [[Canonization|canonized]] St <U+00C6>lfheah in 1078, with a [[Calendar of saints|feast day]] of 19&nbsp;April.<ref name=DictSaint>Delaney ''Dictionary of Saints'' pp. 29<U+2013>30</ref> [[Lanfranc]], the first post-[[Norman conquest of England|conquest]] Norman archbishop, was dubious about some of the saints venerated at Canterbury. He was persuaded of <U+00C6>lfheah's sanctity,<ref name=Conquest137>Williams ''English and the Norman Conquest'' p. 137</ref> but <U+00C6>lfheah and [[Augustine of Canterbury]] were the only pre-conquest Anglo-Saxon archbishops kept on Canterbury's calendar of saints.<ref name=ASE672>Stenton ''Anglo-Saxon England'' p. 672</ref> <U+00C6>lfheah's shrine, which had become neglected, was rebuilt and expanded in the early [[12th century|twelfth century]] under [[Anselm of Canterbury]], who was instrumental in retaining <U+00C6>lfheah's name in the church calendar.<ref name=PopularReligion40>Brooke ''Popular Religion in the Middle Ages'' p. 40</ref><ref>Southern "St Anselm and his English Pupils" ''Mediaeval and Renaissance Studies''</ref>  After the 1174 fire in [[Canterbury Cathedral]], <U+00C6>lfheah's remains together with those of [[Dunstan|Saint Dunstan]] were placed around the High Altar, at which [[Thomas Becket]] is said to have commended his life into <U+00C6>lfheah's care shortly before his martyrdom.<ref name=DNB/> The new shrine was sealed in lead,<ref name=Shrines33>Nilson ''Cathedral Shrines'' p. 33</ref> and was north of the High Altar, sharing the honour with St. Dunstan's shrine, which was located south of the High Altar.<ref name=Shrines66>Nilson ''Cathedral Shrines'' pp. 66<U+2013>67</ref>  An incised paving slab to the north of the present High Altar marks the spot where the medieval [[shrine]] is believed to have stood.<ref name=DictSaint/> A ''Life of St. Alphege'' in prose and verse was written by a Canterbury monk named [[Osbern of Canterbury|Osbern]], at Lanfranc's request. The prose version has survived, but the ''Life'' is very much a hagiography: many of the stories it contains have obvious Biblical parallels, making them suspect as a historical record.<ref name=DNB/>

In the late medieval period, <U+00C6>lfheah's feast day was celebrated in Scandinavia, perhaps because of the saint's connection with Cnut.<ref name=Blair504>Blair "Handlist of Anglo-Saxon Saints" ''Local Saints and Local Churches'' p. 504</ref> In 1929 a new church in Bath was dedicated to Saint Alphege, designed by [[Giles Gilbert Scott]] in homage to the ancient Roman church of [[Santa Maria in Cosmedin]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.saintalphege.org.uk/2building.html |title=St Alphege's Church: The Building |publisher=St Alphege's Church, Bath }} Accessed 30 August 2009</ref>
