Kantor is associated with and serves on the boards of many communal and [[civic organizations]] and has made significant contributions to the development of essential European concepts including Model National Statute for the Promotion of Tolerance and <U+201C>Secure Tolerance,<U+201D> whereby tolerance as an objective can only be assured with personal security for the individual and the repression of intolerance as a society.

To promote this concept, Kantor has initiated the establishment of a European academic center dedicated to researching and studying tolerance.<ref name=his-bio/> 

Kantor<U+2019>s work promoting tolerance and reconciliation, [[human rights]] and interfaith dialogue, and his struggle against [[anti-Semitism]] and racism earned him numerous awards in recent years from European heads of state, including the Italian Knight<U+2019>s Grand Cross of the Order of Merit (2013), the highest decoration given to a non-Italian and France<U+2019>s prestigious L<U+00E9>gion d<U+2019>Honneur (2010).

Kantor has been the President of the [[European Jewish Congress]] (EJC) since 2007, having been re-elected to the position in 2008 and again in 2012.

The <U+201C>Let My People Live!<U+201D> World Forum was attended by more than 40 heads of states and official delegations. 

Kantor<U+2019>s involvement in promoting Jewish life also extends to being the key founder and chairman of the [[European Jewish Fund]] (EJF), which focuses on promoting Jewish life throughout Europe by supporting programmes to reinforce Jewish identity and Jewish pride, especially by re-connecting young people with their rich and vital Jewish heritage.

The ECTR is a non-governmental organization composed of former heads of European states, Nobel Peace Prize laureates and other world renowned individuals for their achievements in ' promoting tolerance '. The ECTR was established to fight [[xenophobia]], [[extremism]] and [[anti-Semitism]], monitor European countries<U+2019> adherence to principles of ' tolerance ', develop practical initiatives, and make recommendations for promoting mutual understanding between cultures.
