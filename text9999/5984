specifies the organization of the state party and how candidates will be selected.  The 79-member State Central Committee sets the policy and plans for the party between larger State Conventions, which gather at least once every four years.

Candidates for elective office can be selected by (1) mass meetings, (2) party canvasses, (3) conventions, or (4) primaries.  A mass meeting consists of a meeting where any participants must remain until votes are taken at the end.  A party canvass or "firehouse primary" allows participants to arrive anytime during announced polling hours, cast a secret ballot, and then leave.  A convention includes a process for selecting delegates, and then only the delegates may vote.  Mass meetings, party canvasses and conventions are conducted by party officials and volunteers.  Primaries are administered by the [http://www.sbe.state.va.us State Board of Elections] at all established polling places.  Because Virginia does not have party registrations, participation in primaries are open to any register voter regardless of party.  However, on [[June 15]], [[2006]], the Plan was amended to redefine a primary:

<blockquote>
"Primary" is as defined in and subject to the Election Laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, except to the extent that any provisions of such laws conflict with this Plan, infringe the right to freedom of association, or are otherwise invalid.{{fact|date=December 2007}}
</blockquote>

At the same time, the Plan was amended to require participants in any of the candidate selection methods to "express in open meeting either orally or in writing as may be required their intent to support all [Republican] nominees for public office in the ensuing election".

The candidate selection process has been criticised as favoring "party insiders" and disfavoring moderate candidates.  For example, both [[Jim Gilmore]] and the more moderate [[Thomas M. Davis]] were seeking the 2008 Republican candidate for [[U.S. Senate]].  However, two weeks following the decision that the candidate will be selected at a convention instead of a primary,<ref name="inrich">{{cite web

=== Open primary litigation ===

Virginia does not provide for voters to register by party.  Virginia law requires [[open primary|"open" primaries]] that are not restricted based on party registration:

<blockquote>
All persons qualified to vote... may vote at the primary. No person shall vote for the candidates of more than one party.<ref name="vacode-24.2-530">{{cite web

</blockquote>

In 2004, the Republican Party amended the State Party Plan to attempt to restrict participation in primaries to exclude voters who had voted in a Democratic primary after [[March 1]], [[2004]], or in the last five
years, whichever is more recent.  In August 2004, [[Stephen Martin (Virginia)|Stephen Martin]], an encumbent State Senator, designated that the Republican candidate for his seat in the November 2007 election should be selected by primary.  The Republicans then sued the State Board of Elections demanding that a closed primary be held, with taxpayer funding of a mechanism to exclude voters who had participated in past Democratic primaries.<ref name="MillerBrown-pp4-5">{{cite web

The Federal District Court dismissed the suit on standing and ripeness grounds. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed and sent the case back for a trial on its merits.

The Republican State Central Committee dropped plans to require voters to sign a loyalty oath before voting in the February 2008 Presidential primary.  The party had proposed to require each voter to sign a pledge stating "I, the undersigned, pledge that I intend to support the nominee of the Republican Party for President."  However, there was no way to enforce the pledge, and the proposal caused vocal public opposition.<ref name="Craig-pledge">{{cite news

== Richard D. Obenshain Center ==

The party headquarters building is named the Richard D. Obenshain Center in memory of [[Richard D. Obenshain]] (1936-1978), the State Party Chairman who beginning in 1972, helped lead the party's renaissance in Virginia following 85 years of virtual control by the State's [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] (since [[Reconstruction]] when [[William Mahone]] and the [[Readjuster Party]] coalition dominated affairs for a few years). 

In 1978, "Dick" Obenshain had won the party's nomination to run for the U.S. Senate to replace retiring Senator [[William Scott]] when the 42-year old candidate and two others were killed in an [[airplane crash]] of a twin engine aircraft on [[August 2]], [[1978]] while attempting a night landing at the [[Chesterfield County, Virginia|Chesterfield County Airport]]. They had been returning to Richmond from a campaign appearance.

== Current leadership ==

[[Ed Gillespie]] was elected as the new Chairman of the RPV on [[December 2]], [[2006]].  He resigned on [[June 13]], [[2007]] to become the counselor to President [[George W. Bush]].  Mike Thomas served as interim chairman until July 21 when former [[Lieutenant Governor of Virginia]] John Hager was elected chairman.  On [[April 9]], [[2007]] the RPV named Fred Malek to serve as the Finance Chairman and Lisa Gable to serve as the Finance Committee Co-Chair.<ref name="rpv-2007-04-09">{{cite web

[[Kate Obenshain Griffin]] of [[Winchester, Virginia|Winchester]] became the party's chairman in 2004. Following Senator [[George Allen (U.S. politician)|George Allen's]] unsuccessful 2006 reelection bid, Griffin submitted her resignation as Chairman effective [[November 15]], [[2006]].  Her brother, [[Mark Obenshain]], is a [[Virginia State Senate|State Senator]] from [[Harrisonburg, Virginia|Harrisonburg]] in the [[Virginia General Assembly]]. They are the children of the late Richard D. Obenshain.

==Policy Positions==
While Virginia Republicans take positions on a wide variety of issues, some of the noteworthy ones include:

Republicans lost control of the State Senate in the 2007 election, and narrowed their majority in the [[Virginia House of Delegates|House of Delegates]].  The Democrats now have 21 Senate seats with one more being the subject of a possible recount. Republicans will hold a 7- or 8-seat majority in the House.

[[Image:VHoDmakeup.jpg|thumb|Historic Partisan Makeup of the Virginia House of Delegates]]

In 2006, a budget deadlock between the Republican-controlled House of Delegates and the Republican-controlled [[Senate of Virginia|Senate]] resulted in the legislative session extending far beyond its normal term as well as a special session.

As a part of the 2007 campaign, two Republican Delegates who are unopposed, C. Tood Gilbert and C.L. Athley Jr., are publicizing their investigation that [[Democratic Party of Virginia|Democratic]] leaders support radical Islamic organizations.  These delegates report that the [[Muslim American Society]] and the Dar Al Hijrah Islamic Center, both of which are located in [[Falls Church, Virginia]], are connected to radical Islam, even though federal officials found no such connection.<ref name="farrell">{{cite news

House Speaker [[William J. Howell]] has not sanctioned the Gilbert-Athley report, but the Speaker's staff has been helping distribute their findings to the media. Gilbert and Athley allege that the mosque is linked to terrorism because two of the <nowiki>September 11, 2001</nowiki> hijackers had worshipped there in the months before the attack.  But the [[FBI]] and the Presidential [[9/11 Commission]] both concluded that the mosque had no role in the attacks. In response, Delacey Skinner, Governor [[Tim Kaine]]'s communications director, stated that "Politics and campaigning have stooped to a new low when the governor of Virginia's efforts to reach out to people of all faiths and races is characterized as an association with terrorists."<ref name="craig-dem-terror">{{cite news

In 2007, the need to fund $1 billion per year for pressing transportation projects resulted in another impass between the House of Delegates and [[Senate of Virginia|Senate]].  Rather than approve additional tax increases, the final Republican plan, which was enacted into law, resulted in new fees of up to $3,000 for abusive drivers, which are assessed against Virginia residents in addition to the historic fines assessed on out-of-state drivers convicted of the same driving law violations.  The Republican plan also called for issuing general obligation bonds which Democrats claim may reduce funding of non-transportation needs in future years.  On [[23 August]] [[2007]], the Republican leaders of the House and Senate responded to public opposition of the new fees by promising to moderate them in the 2008 legislative session.<ref name="Lewis">{{cite news

The second step is a set of city and county caucuses to elect delegates to Congressional District and the State Conventions.  The third step is a series of Congressional District conventions to be held in late April and early May 2008, where some delegates to the Republican National Convention are selected.  The Republican State Convention will be held in [[Richmond, Virginia]] on May 30-31, 2008.  That convention will select the Republican Senate nominee as well as twenty-seven (27) delegates and twenty-seven (27) alternate
delegates at large to the 2008 Republican National Convention.<ref>Convention Call, http://www.rpv.org/?q=node/77 Retrieved 2008-03-06.</ref>  Because the Republican primary is winner-take-all, all National Convention delegates elected must vote for John McCain on the first ballot,<ref>http://www.rpv.org/?q=node/341 Retrieved 2008-03-06.</ref> so the main criteria for selecting State Convention delegates will be their preference for U.S. Senate nominees.

As of December 2007, Republicans hold one of Virginia's two seats in the U.S. Senate, eight of eleven seats in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]], and a majority in the [[Virginia House of Delegates]].  Additionally, Republicans serve as Virginia's Lieutenant Governor and Attorney General.
