The '''''William B. Tennison''''' is a [[Chesapeake Bay]] [[bugeye]] built in 1899 and converted to an oyster [[buy-boat]] in 1906-07.  With the conversion her sail rig was removed and an engine inserted, and is the only surviving example of this conversion.  Her construction marks a transition between log construction and plank construction.  She is homeported at the [[Calvert Marine Museum]] in [[Solomons, Maryland]] <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marylandhistoricaltrust.net/nr/NRDetail.aspx?HDID=613&FROM=NRNHLList.aspx|title=Maryland Historical Trust|date=2008-06-08|work= National Register of Historic Places:

The ''Tennison'' is reputed to be the second oldest licensed passenger vessel in the [[United States]]<ref name="nrhpinv1">{{cite web|url=http://pdfhost.focus.nps.gov/docs/NHLS/Text/80001799.pdf|title=National Historic Landmark Nomination|last=Eshelman|first=Ralph|date=August 23, 1993|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=2009-04-03}}</ref>.

It was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1980, and as a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1994.<ref name="nris"/>

==Description==
The ''William B. Tennison'' was built as a nine-log sailing bugeye, using pitch pine logs, {{convert|9|in|cm}} thick at the keel and tapering to {{convert|6|in|cm}} at the outer edges. She is {{convert|60.5|ft|m}} long on deck and has a beam of {{convert|17.5|ft|m}} with a draft of {{convert|4.5|ft|m}}.The hullform is flat-bottomed with rounded chines, and is sharp at each end. Framing and planking are built up above the logs for freeboard, using oak frames at approximate {{convert |30|in|cm|adj=on}} centers. A bulhead separates the foc'sle from the hold.  A second blunkhead was added when she was converted to power between the hold nd the engine compartment.  At the same time the [[centerboard]] trunk was removed. A "patent stern" was added to sqaure the deck above the sharp stern and add working space. A portion of the rudder has been cut away to allow for a propeller.<ref name="nrhpinv1"/>

For her conversion to a buy-boat the ''Tennison''s mainmast and the running rigging to the foremast, necessary for sailing, were removed. The foremast was then used to hoist bushel-sized oyster baskets from other vessels to the hold using two gaff-rigged booms. A pilothouse with a rounded from was added, as is typical in Chesapeake Bay buy-boats. Three windows occupy the front, with one window and a door on each side. The pilothouse is covered with vertical tongue and groove cypress siding. Two bunks are on the port side aft, along with an enclosed head aft. A floor hatch gives access to the engine compartment. The foc'sle once housed three bunks, a table and a cookstove.<ref name="nrhpinv1"/>

==History==
The ''William B. Tennison'' was built in 1899 by Frank Laird of [[Monie, Maryland]] at Crabb Island, near [[Oriole, Maryland]]. She was built relatively late for a bugeye, as the type was going out of style in favor of the smaller, cheaper [[skipjack (boat)|skipjack]]. Benjamin P. and Rufus L. Miles of Monie used her as an oyster dredge until 1908-09 when she was converted to power. In 1910 the ''Tennison'' was sold to Alphonse Lafayette Hazelwood of [[Eclipse, Virginia]] who used her to haul produce in the [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]] and [[Albemarle Sound]] area until 1930. During the oyster season she was used as a buy-boat. Her original 37 horsepower engine was replaced with a 60 horsepower engine during this time. She was sold to Barney B. Winnal of [[Carrollton, Virginia]] in 1933 for $2050. After her sale to O.A. Bloxom of the Battery Park Fish and Oyster Company near [[Smithfield, Virginia]], she was sold in 1944 to J.C Lore and Sons of [[Solomons, Maryland]]. The Lores used ''Tennison'' to dredge oysters on their private beds, where power could be used, and as a buy-boat.<ref name="nrhpinv1"/>

The ''Tennison'' was partially rebuilt at the H. Krentz Railway in [[Harryhogan, Virginia]] in 1952. The pilot house was rebuilt during this time. She was beached by [[Hurricane Hazel]] in 1952, and the scar from being dragged over an obstruction to refloat her is reputedly still visible when she is hauled out of the water. In 1955 a Grey Marine 155-horsepower diesel engine was installed, possibly having been taken from a naval landing craft. She was converted to a passenger boat in 1977, with nearly all of the structural frames replaced at that time.<ref name="nrhpinv1"/>

The identity of her namesake, William B. Tennison, remains unknown.
