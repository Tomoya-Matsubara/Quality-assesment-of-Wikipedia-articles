'''''Mischief Makers''''', known in Japan as {{nihongo|'''''Yuke Yuke!! Trouble Makers'''''|<U+3086><U+3051><U+3086><U+3051><U+FF01><U+FF01><U+30C8><U+30E9><U+30D6><U+30EB><U+30E1><U+30FC><U+30AB><U+30FC><U+30BA>|lead=yes}}, is a 1997 [[side-scrolling]] [[platform game|platform]] video game developed by [[Treasure (company)|Treasure]] and published by [[Enix]] and [[Nintendo]] for the [[Nintendo 64]]. The player assumes the role of Marina, a robotic maid who journeys to rescue her creator from the emperor of Planet Clancer. The gameplay revolves around grabbing, shaking, and throwing objects. There are five worlds and 52 levels, and the game is displayed in "[[2<U+00BD>D]]".

The game was the first 2D side-scroller for the Nintendo 64, and Treasure's first release for a Nintendo console. The company began ''Mischief Makers''{{'s}} development in mid-1995 with little knowledge of the console's features. The 12-person team wanted to make a novel gameplay mechanic, and implementing the resultant "catching" technique became their most difficult task. The game appeared at the 1997 [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]] and was first released in Japan on June 27, 1997, and later in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia.

The game received "mixed or average reviews", according to video game review score aggregator [[Metacritic]]. Critics praised ''Mischief Makers''{{'s}} inventiveness, personality, and [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]] fights, but criticized its brevity, low difficulty, low [[replay value]], sound, and harsh introductory learning curve. Retrospective reviewers disagreed with the originally poor reception, and multiple reviewers noted Marina's signature "Shake, shake!" [[sound bite]] as a highlight. Video game journalists cited ''Mischief Makers'' as ripe for reissue either through the [[Nintendo eShop]] or in a sequel or franchise reboot. In 2009, ''GamesRadar'' called it "possibly the most underrated and widely ignored game on the N64".

== Gameplay ==

[[File:MischiefMakers--article image.jpg|thumb|left|Marina grabs a bomb with "Clanball" platforms and warp stars nearby.]] ''Mischief Makers'' is the first [[single-player]] 2D [[side-scrolling]] [[platform game]] on the [[Nintendo 64]] console.<ref name="IGN review"/> Its gameplay combines platform [[game mechanics]] with aspects from the action and puzzle genres.<ref name="Nintendo Life review"/> The characters and backgrounds are modeled in pre-rendered 3D<ref name="NP review"/> similar to ''[[Donkey Kong Country]]''{{'s}} "Advanced Computer Modeling".<ref name="Nintendo Life review"/> This style, with 3D backgrounds behind 2D gameplay, is known as "[[2<U+00BD>D]]".<ref name="IGN: Griffey"/> Compared to previous Treasure [[Run and gun (video game)|run and gun games]], ''Mischief Makers''{{'s}} gameplay is more exploratory in nature.<ref name="NWR review"/>

The game has five worlds with roughly twelve [[Level (video gaming)|levels]] apiece.{{efn|The five worlds are Planet Clancer, Migen's Shrine, Mt.

== Development ==

[[File:N64-Console-Set.jpg|thumb|The Nintendo 64 console]] 
[[Treasure (company)|Treasure]] began to develop ''Mischief Makers'' in mid 1995. At the time, they knew little about the Nintendo 64's final technical specifications, graphics implementation, and [[development kit]], but were nevertheless interested in the console and its improved "[[pixel]] quality".<ref name="IGN: Treasure talks"/> Historically, Treasure developed games exclusively for Sega consoles,<ref name="IGN: Treasure talks"/>{{efn|Treasure continued to develop for the [[Sega Genesis]] even while Nintendo had market control because they found the Genesis development process easier.<ref name="IGN: Treasure talks"/>}} which made ''Mischief Makers'' their first release for a Nintendo console.<ref name="Nintendo Life review"/> Bringing ''Mischief Makers'' to the Nintendo 64 was a hardware-based decision:<ref name="IGN: Treasure talks"/> the Nintendo 64's [[video game cartridge|cartridges]] were more expensive than [[CD-ROMs]], but they loaded data instantly and were thus more conducive for [[action games]] such as ''Mischief Makers''. However, Treasure [[CEO]] Masato Maegawa said that development for the Nintendo 64 had a harsher learning curve than even the [[Sega Saturn]]. Other than the special attention required to build a single boss in 3D, the team did not use features specific to the Nintendo 64 hardware.<ref name="IGN: Treasure talks"/>

Treasure's founders had come from [[Konami]], where they worked on [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] games such as ''[[Castlevania (video game)|Castlevania]]'' and ''[[Contra (video game)|Contra]]''.<ref name="IGN review"/> They found their development environment restrictive and left to try riskier concepts and to singularly focus on making "great games".<ref name="IGN: Treasure talks"/> In the three years between Treasure's founding and ''Mischief Makers''{{'s}} development, the company released highly regarded games such as ''[[Gunstar Heroes]]''<U+2014>known as "one of the definitive [[16-bit era|16-bit]] action games"<U+2014>and ''[[Dynamite Headdy]]''.<ref name="IGN: Treasure talks"/> An average of 12 people worked on ''Mischief Makers'', with up to 15 at times. Though the team was different in composition from that of previous Treasure titles, it included the lead programmer and character designer from ''Gunstar Heroes''. Treasure's CEO said that the company liked to expand into new genres, though they primarily work in genres where the staff had experience. The company sought to depart from the ''Gunstar Heroes'' [[shoot 'em up]] design, and chose to build ''Mischief Makers'' around an original "catching" gameplay mechanic, which became the hardest aspect to implement.<ref name="IGN: Treasure talks"/> While foreign (non-Japanese) aesthetics were popular with other Japanese developers, Treasure's CEO felt the company's games did not look "particularly foreign" and could appeal to Japanese audiences.<ref name="IGN: Treasure talks"/>

The game was Treasure's first to be published by [[Enix]]. The publisher sought out Treasure for their reputation in the action game genre, and had approached Treasure several times before the Nintendo 64 project surfaced.{{efn|Treasure CEO Maegawa was already fond of Enix, having applied to work there as a student (though he did not get the job).<ref name="IGN: Treasure talks"/>}} Upon choosing to make the game for the Nintendo 64, Treasure thought it would be a "good idea" to work with Enix.<ref name="IGN: Treasure talks"/> And similar to how Treasure ended its historic loyalty to the [[Sega Genesis]] by developing ''Mischief Makers'' for Nintendo, Enix had just recently ended its historic loyalty to Nintendo by signing ''[[Dragon Quest VII]]'' of their ''[[Dragon Quest]]'' franchise to Sony. Neither Square or Enix built a "special relationship" with Nintendo specific for ''Mischief Makers''{{'s}} release,<ref name="IGN: Treasure talks"/> though Nintendo later served as the game's publisher for Western markets.<ref name="IGN: Nintendo to publish"/> When their English localization of the Japanese game finished ahead of schedule, the North American release date was advanced two weeks accordingly.<ref name="IGN: Griffey"/>

''Mischief Makers'' was demonstrated at the 1997 [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]]<ref name="IGN: Nintendo to publish"/> and later released in Japan on June 27, 1997, the United States on October 1, and the United Kingdom and Australia on January 15, 1998.<ref name="IGN review"/> Its Japanese title is ''Yuke-Yuke Trouble Makers'', or ''Go-Go Trouble Makers''.<ref name="IGN: Treasure talks"/> Near the time of the game's Japanese launch, Treasure announced that they would continue to develop for the Nintendo 64 with the Japan-only ''[[Bakuretsu Muteki Bangaioh]]'', which was released in September and later introduced to North America as ''Bangai-O''.<ref name="IGN: Bakuretsu"/>

''Mischief Makers'' received "mixed or average reviews", according to video game review score aggregator [[Metacritic]],<ref name=Metacritic/> and a "Gold Hall of Fame" score of 32/40 from Japanese reviewer ''[[Weekly Famitsu]]''.<ref name=Famitsu/> Critics praised the game's inventiveness, personality, "variety", and boss fights,<ref name="Nintendo Life review"/><ref name="AllGame review"/><ref name="GS review"/><ref name="EGM review"/> and criticized its brevity, low difficulty, low [[replay value]],<ref name="AllGame review"/><ref name="GS review"/><ref name="GI review"/> sound,<ref name="IGN review"/><ref name="NP review"/><ref name="GS review"/><ref name="NG review"/> and harsh introductory learning curve.<ref name="Nintendo Life review"/><ref name="AllGame review"/><ref name="EGM review"/> Retrospective reviewers disagreed with the game's originally poor reception,<ref name=Gamasutra/><ref name="GamesRadar: untapped"/> and multiple reviewers noted Marina's signature "Shake, shake!" [[sound bite]] as a highlight.<ref name="NWR review"/><ref name="AllGame review"/><ref name="EGM review"/> ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' awarded the game their silver award.<ref name="EGM review"/>

[[IGN]]'s Matt Casamassina said that the game compensated for its average graphics with excellent level design and gameplay challenges. He added that the game's puzzles require thought, unlike those in other action/platform games, and that the game's objectives were not clear until after the first few levels. Casamassina praised the game's transparency effects, [[anti-aliasing]], [[mipmapping]], and scaling rotations.<ref name="IGN review"/> IGN described anticipation for the game as "tremendous",<ref name="IGN: Nintendo to publish"/> particularly among the game's market of "younger gamers and 2D fans".<ref name="IGN: Griffey"/> ''[[Nintendo Power]]'' thought that the game was the best side-scroller since ''[[Super Mario World]]''.<ref name="NP review"/> ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' wrote that "only diehard 2D platform fans" would be interested and did not feel that the game lived up to standards set by ''[[Mario 64]]''.<ref name="NG review"/> In contrast, ''[[GameFan]]'' said that ''Mischief Makers'' did for 2D what ''Mario 64'' did for 3D, and suggested that [[Sega]] should be influenced by the game.<ref name="GameFan spread"/> ''[[GamesRadar]]'' retrospectively called ''Mischief Makers'' "pure, unadulterated awesome" and "2D brilliance". The website summarized the game to be about "grabbing sad-faced aliens, shaking them until gems come out, and then hurling them at other sad-faced aliens."<ref name="GamesRadar: untapped"/> Zachary Miller of ''[[Nintendo World Report]]'' asserted the game may be the console's most bizarre and surreal,<ref name="NWR review"/> but ''[[Gamasutra]]''{{'s}} John Harris said that the game's premise is "only strange to people who have never heard of [[anime]]".<ref name=Gamasutra/> ''GameFan'' described the game as "obviously deeply Japanese",<ref name="GameFan spread"/> where "old school gameplay and 64-bit visuals finally meet".<ref name="GameFan review"/>

''Nintendo Life''{{'s}} Jamie O'Neill praised the game's characters and disliked the controls. He compared the Calina character to the role of Shadow Mario in ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]''.<ref name="Nintendo Life review"/> O'Neill wrote that the intricate controls were "the antithesis of a friendly, approachable, and intuitive platformer" because the game used every button on the controller (including the [[directional pad]]), though he felt that players who persevered through the difficult controls would find them "inventive and unique".<ref name="Nintendo Life review"/> He added that the complex controls allowed for experimentation that led to new and fun gameplay, and though the throwing enemies mechanic seemed to follow from ''Gunstar Heroes'', the Clanball platforming was unintuitive.<ref name="Nintendo Life review"/> John Harris of ''Gamasutra'' wrote that the game borrowed other elements from ''Gunstar Heroes'', as the games were similar in protagonists, collectible gems,{{efn|He added that the gems awarded for "A" rating finish times were difficult to collect.<ref name=Gamasutra/>}} and bosses.<ref name=Gamasutra/>{{efn|Harris also put Marina's "grab" in a lineage of Treasure's signature [[counterattack]] mechanics (where a player can escape an attack with a well timed button press), which he extrapolated out to counterattacks in ''[[Viewtiful Joe]]'' and ''[[Soul Calibur]]''.<ref name=Gamasutra/>}} As the game took time to learn and understand, O'Neill left the reader to decide whether the game was "ultimately convoluted or bordering on sophistication and genius".<ref name="Nintendo Life review"/>

''Nintendo Life''{{'s}} O'Neill thought the five world bosses were among Treasure's best (in particular, the transforming "Cerberus Alpha" boss), but found the mid-level bosses uninteresting.<ref name="Nintendo Life review"/> Peter Bartholow of ''[[GameSpot]]''<ref name="GS review"/> and ''Electronic Gaming Monthly''{{'s}} reviewers felt similarly. [[Sushi-X]] of ''Electronic Gaming Monthly'' added that the technique of looking for a boss's weak spot was similar to ''[[Metroid]]''.<ref name="EGM review"/> O'Neill thought the game had great variety in gameplay mechanics (from maze puzzles to outrunning lava), graphics (from bosses that scale back the screen to levels with screen rotation), and audio (from upbeat quirk to scary), and added that he was surprised to hear critics speak against the "unique, varied, and dramatic" sound.<ref name="Nintendo Life review"/> Scott McCall of [[AllGame]] too appreciated the sound, from the voice to the "almost indescribable" music.<ref name="AllGame review"/> ''Gamasutra''{{'s}} John Harris noted its "tremendous variety" in gameplay<U+2014>from a ''[[Track & Field (video game)|Track & Field]]'' remake to outrunning a missile barrage<U+2014>as rare for 2D platformers, and commented that "it is obvious that Treasure poured their hearts into this game."<ref name=Gamasutra/>

Peter Bartholow of ''GameSpot'' summarized ''Mischief Makers'' as "a good game that will leave players wanting more".<ref name="GS review"/> He liked the bosses, which made the player use all available skills, but felt they were short-lived and easily solved in the context of a short game with tutorials as one fifth of its levels.<ref name="GS review"/> He did not consider the ending extension a suitable reward for returning to the levels, and predicted that most players would not finish the game more than once.<ref name="GS review"/> ''[[Game Informer]]'' echoed Bartholow's comments about the game's brevity, and named the game's seven-event olympics as a highlight.<ref name="GI review"/> Sushi-X of ''Electronic Gaming Monthly'' wrote that the game felt incomplete and lamented that "a decent player can finish the game in under three hours",<ref name="EGM review"/> though ''Next Generation'' said the game was "certainly long enough".<ref name="NG review"/> The game's frequent reuse of a small selection of tiles, objects, sound effects, soundtracks, and bland backgrounds (compared to the "impressive" boss battle animations and effects) led ''GameSpot''{{'s}} Bartholow to suggest that ''Mischief Makers'' was limited by its cartridge space. He concluded that the "decent" game would be "truly excellent ... on another medium".<ref name="GS review"/> Zachary Miller of ''Nintendo World Report'' reported that the graphics did not age well into 2010.<ref name="NWR review"/> ''Electronic Gaming Monthly'' wrote that the game is "definitely a [[sleeper hit]]".<ref name="EGM review"/> As ''[[Hardcore Gamer]]''{{'s}} Ryan Cartmel put it, the game went "largely unnoticed".<ref name="Hardcore Gamer"/>

=== Legacy ===

Video game journalists from outlets such as ''GamesRadar'' and ''Nintendo World Report'' cited ''Mischief Makers'' as ripe for reissue either through the [[Nintendo eShop]] or in a sequel or franchise reboot.<ref name="GamesRadar: untapped"/><ref name=NWR/> ''[[Retro Gamer]]'' placed the "masterpiece of mayhem" 80th on their list of "essential" Nintendo 64 games for its "unbridled quality".<ref name="Retro Gamer 31"/> In 2009, ''GamesRadar'' called it "possibly the most underrated and widely ignored game on the N64".<ref name="GamesRadar: untapped"/>{{efn|In the years since, ''Retro Gamer'' reported ''Mischief Makers'' as a somewhat rare collectible, with a rarity score of 7/10.<ref name="Retro Gamer 4"/>}} The website wrote that ''Mischief Makers'' was received poorly because players wanted 3D instead of 2D gameplay from Nintendo 64 games.<ref name="GamesRadar: untapped"/> ''Gamasutra''{{'s}} John Harris added that those who gave it a "bum rap" missed a "surprisingly clever" game.<ref name=Gamasutra/> ''[[UGO Networks|UGO]]'' remembered the game as innovative, though imperfect, and asked to see Marina reinterpreted and resurrected in a new game.<ref name=UGO/>{{efn|Marina reappeared as an unlockable character in Treasure's 1999 ''[[Rakugaki Showtime]]''.<ref name="Retro Gamer 52"/>}}
