'''Zinfandel''' (also known as '''Primitivo''') is a [[cultivar|variety]] of red [[grape]]. The grape is planted in over 10 percent of [[California wine|California vineyards]].<ref name="CA area">{{cite web | last = National Agricultural Statistics Service | title = Grape Acreage Reports | publisher = USDA | date = 2007-04-13 | url = http://www.nass.usda.gov/Statistics_by_State/California/Publications/Fruits_and_Nuts/indexgar.asp | accessdate = 2007-12-17 }}</ref> DNA fingerprinting revealed that it is genetically equivalent to the [[Croatia]]n grapes '''Crljenak Ka<U+0161>telanski''' and as well as '''Tribidrag'''<ref name="Financial Times">Jancis Robinson ''"[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/a9c6ef26-cc33-11e1-839a-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2Ar5ulIst The Great Grapevine]"'' ''The Financial Times'' October 12th, 2012</ref> and the '''Primitivo''' variety traditionally grown in [[Puglia]] (the "heel" of [[Italy]]), where it was introduced in the 18th century. The grape found its way to the United States in the mid-19th century, and became known by variations of the name "Zinfandel", a name of uncertain origin.

The grapes typically produce a robust red [[wine]], although a semi-sweet [[ros<U+00E9>]] (blush-style) wine called [[White Zinfandel]] has six times the sales of the red wine in the United States.<ref name="USsales">{{cite web | title = U.S. wine sales 2006 | work = | publisher = Wine Communications Group | date = | url=http://www.winebusiness.com/SalesMarketing/webarticle.cfm?dataId=42231 | accessdate=2007-12-17 }}</ref> The grape's high sugar content can be [[fermentation (wine)|fermented]] into levels of alcohol exceeding 15 percent.<ref name="Sullivan">{{cite book | last = Sullivan| first = Charles L | title = Zinfandel: A History of a Grape and Its Wine | publisher = [[University of California Press]] | date = 2003-09-02 | location = Berkeley | pages = 167<U+2013>175 | isbn = 978-0-520-23969-2 }}</ref>

The taste of the red wine depends on the [[ripeness (wine)|ripeness]] of the grapes from which it is made. Red berry fruit flavors like [[raspberry]] predominate in wines from cooler areas<!--UNVERIFIED: such as the [[Napa Valley AVA|Napa Valley]]-->,<ref name="Peterson">{{cite journal | last = Peterson| first = Joel | title = To knock all high-alcohol wines is just simplistic | journal = Decanter | issue = December 2007 | pages=8 | publisher = IPC | location = UK}}</ref> whereas [[blackberry]], [[anise]] and [[Black pepper|pepper]] notes are more common in wines made in warmer areas<!-- UNVERIFIED: such as Sonoma County--><ref name="Peterson"/> and in wines made from the earlier-ripening Primitivo clone.

== History ==

=== Europe (6000 BCE <U+2013> 1870) ===
Archaeological evidence indicates that domestication of ''Vitis vinifera'' occurred in the [[Caucasus]] region around 6000 BCE, and [[winemaking]] was discovered shortly after.<ref>{{cite book | author=McGovern, P.E. | year=2003 | url=http://books.google.com/?id=NuUSVEAUrfIC | title=Ancient Wine: The Search for the Origins of Viniculture | publisher=Princeton University Press | isbn=978-0-691-07080-3}}</ref> Cultivation of the vine subsequently spread to the [[Mediterranean region|Mediterranean]] and surrounding regions. Croatia once had several indigenous varieties related to Zinfandel,<ref name="Piljac">{{cite journal | author=Piljac, Jasenka | title=The Application of Bioinformatics Techniques in Genetic Identification and Profiling of Rare Grape Varieties Indigenous to Croatia | journal=Essays in Bioinformatics | url=http://books.google.com/?id=fwuk4zA0YiUC&printsec=frontcover#PPA220,M1 | publisher=IOS Press | volume=368 | year=2005 | pages=220<U+2013>223 | isbn=978-1-58603-539-6}}</ref> which formed the basis of its wine industry in the 19th century. This diversity suggests that the grapes existed in Croatia longer than anywhere else. However, these varieties were almost entirely wiped out by the [[phylloxera]] epidemic of the late 19th century, reducing Zinfandel to just nine vines of locally-known "Crljenak Ka<U+0161>telanski" discovered in 2001 on the Dalmatian coast of Croatia.<ref name="Piljac" />

The first documented use of the term ''Primitivo'' appears in Italian governmental publications of the 1870s.<ref name="Sullivan" /> The name derives from the terms ''primativus'' or ''primaticcio'', which refer to the grape's tendency to ripen earlier than other varieties.<ref name="Apiula">{{cite web | title=Apiula | url=http://www.diwinetaste.com/dwt/en2007042.php | month=March | year=2007 | publisher=DiWineTaste}}</ref> This name's appearance 40 years after the first documented use of the term ''Zinfandel'' was previously thought to suggest that Primitivo was introduced to Italy from across the Atlantic; however, this hypothesis became unlikely since the discovery of the vine's Croatian origin.<ref>{{cite web | author=Albertson, Lynda | title=A Multitude of Zins | url=http://www.theamericanmag.com/article.php?feature=food&column=26&article=793 | publisher=The American | date=2008-01-01 | accessdate=2008-09-08}}</ref>

Primitivo is now thought to have been introduced as a distinct clone into the [[Puglia]] region of Italy in the 18th century.<ref name="Apiula"/><ref name="Strada">{{cite web | title = I vitigni | work = | publisher = Strada del vino a D.O.C.

=== United States east coast (1829<U+2013>1850) ===
The arrival of Zinfandel in the United States may have been via the Imperial Nursery in [[Vienna]], Austria, which likely obtained the vines during the [[Habsburg Monarchy]]'s [[Croatia in the Habsburg Empire|rule over Croatia]], which was expanded when Austria acquired the [[Dalmatia]]n territories of the former [[Republic of Venice]] in 1797.<ref name="Sullivan2">Sullivan, [http://www.ucpress.edu/books/pages/10047/10047.ch02.pdf Chapter 2]</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author=Sweet, Nancy L | title=The Zinfandels of FPS | url=http://fpms.ucdavis.edu/WebSitePDFs/Newsletters&Publications/GrapeNewsletterNov2007.pdf | journal=FPS Grape Program Newsletter | publisher=UC Davis | date=November 2007 | format=PDF | pages=11}}</ref> George Gibbs, a horticulturist on [[Long Island]], received shipments of grapes from [[Sch<U+00F6>nbrunn Palace|Sch<U+00F6>nbrunn]] and elsewhere in Europe between 1820 and 1829.<ref name="Sullivan2" /> Sullivan suggests that the "Black Zinfardel of Hungary" mentioned by [[William Robert Prince]] in ''A Treatise on the Vine'' (1830) may have referred to one of Gibbs' 1829 acquisitions. Webster suggests that the name is a modification of the Hungarian ''tzinif<U+00E1>ndli'' (''czirifandli''), which derives from the German [[Zierfandler]],<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/zinfandel | title=Zinfandel etymology | publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]]}}</ref> a white grape (Gruener Sylvaner) from [[Austrian wine|Austria's]] [[Thermenregion]].

Gibbs visited Boston in 1830, and Samuel Perkins of that city began selling "Zenfendal" soon afterward. In 1830, Gibbs also supplied Prince with "Black St. Peters", a similar variety may have come from England, where many vines have "St. Peters" in their names. Little is known about this vine, except that the Black St. Peters that arrived in California in the 1850s was the same as what became known as Zinfandel by the 1870s.<ref name="Sullivan2"/>

By 1835 Charles M. Hovey, Boston<U+2019>s leading nurseryman, was recommending "Zinfindal" as a table grape, and it was soon widely grown in heated greenhouses for the production of table grapes as early as June. The first reference to making wine from "Zinfindal" appears in John Fisk Allen's ''Practical Treatise in the Culture and Treatment of the Grape Vine'' (1847). Meanwhile the fad of hothouse cultivation faded in the 1850s as attention turned to the [[Concord (grape)|Concord]] and other grape varieties that could be grown outdoors in Boston.<ref name="Sullivan2"/>

=== California (1850<U+2013>1933) ===
Prince and other nurserymen such as Frederick W. Macondray joined the [[California Gold Rush]] in the 1850s, and took Zinfandel with them. Prince's notebook records that the grape dried "perfectly to Raisin" and that he believed his Zinfandel was the same as the "Black Sonora" he found in California. When the vine known as "Black St. Peters" arrived in California, it was initially regarded as a distinct variety, but by the 1870s it was recognized as the same grape as Zinfandel.<ref name="Sullivan2"/>

Joseph W. Osborne may have made the first wine from Zinfandel in California. He planted Zinfandel from Macondray at his Oak Knoll vineyard just north of Napa, and his wine was much praised in 1857.<ref name="Sullivan"/> Planting of Zinfandel boomed soon after, and by the end of the 19th century it was the most widespread variety in California.<ref name="Oxford pg 130 & 786">{{cite book | author=Robinson, J (ed) | title=The Oxford Companion to Wine | edition=3rd | pages=130 &amp; 786 | publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] | year=2006 | isbn=978-0-19-860990-2}}</ref>

These Zinfandel [[old vine]]s are now treasured for the production of premium red wine, but many were ripped up in the 1920s, during the [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] years (1920<U+2013>1933), but not for the obvious reason.<!--awkward--> Even during the Prohibition, home winemaking remained effectively legal,<ref name="Pinney">{{cite book | first=Thomas | last = Pinney | title=A History of Wine in America From Prohibition to the Present| month=July | year=2005 |isbn=978-0-520-24176-3 | publisher=University of California Press | location=Berkeley}} p2 [http://www.ucpress.edu/books/pages/10206/pinney1.pdf Chapter 1]</ref> and some vineyards embraced the sale of grapes for making wine at home. While Zinfandel grapes proved popular among home winemakers living near the vineyards, it was vulnerable to rot on the long journey to East Coast markets.<ref name="Pinney26">Pinney p26</ref> The thick-skinned [[Alicante Bouschet]] was less susceptible to rot, so this and similar varieties were widely planted for the home winemaking market.<ref name="Pinney26"/><ref name="Johnson pg 444">{{cite book | author=Johnson, H | title=Vintage: The Story of Wine | pages=444 | publisher=[[Simon and Schuster]] | year=1989 | isbn=978-0-671-68702-1}}</ref> Three thousand cars (about 38000&nbsp;t) of Zinfandel grapes were shipped in 1931, compared to 6000 cars of Alicante Bouschet.<ref name="Pinney26"/>

===Rediscovery after Prohibition (1933 <U+2013> present)===
By 1930, the wine industry had weakened due to the [[Great Depression]] and Prohibition.<ref>Pinney, p10</ref> Many vineyards that survived by supplying the home market were located in California's [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]], a non-optimal environment for growing quality Zinfandel.<ref name="Pinney26"/> Thus, the end of Prohibition left a shortage of quality wine grapes,<ref name="Pinney26"/> and Zinfandel sank into obscurity as most was blended into undistinguished fortified wines. However, some producers remained interested in making single [[varietal]] red wines.

By the middle of the 20th century the origins of California Zinfandel had been forgotten. In 1972, one British wine writer wrote, "there is a fascinating Californian grape, the zinfandel, said to have come from Hungary, but apparently a [[c<U+00E9>page]] now unknown there."<ref>{{cite book | author=Yoxall, H.W. | year=1974 | title=The Enjoyment of Wine | publisher=Drake Publishers Inc. | location=New York | isbn=978-0-87749-463-8}}</ref>  In 1974 and 1981, American wine writers described it as "a California original, grown nowhere else"<ref>{{cite book

In 1972, Bob Trinchero of the [[Sutter Home Winery]] decided to try draining some juice from the vats in order to impart more tannins and color to his Deaver Vineyard Zinfandel. He vinified this juice as a dry wine, and tried to sell it under the name of [[Oeil de Perdrix]], a French wine made by this [[Ros<U+00E9>#Saign<U+00E9>e|saign<U+00E9>e]] method.<ref name="Murphy">{{cite news | author=Murphy, Linda | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2003/07/03/WI178515.DTL | title=White Zinfandel, now 30, once ruled the U.S. wine world | publisher=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] | date=2003-07-03}}</ref> The [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms]] insisted on an English translation, so he added "White Zinfandel" to the name, and sold 220 cases.<ref name="Murphy" /> At the time, demand for white wine exceeeded the availability of white wine grapes, encouraging other California producers to make "white" wine from red grapes, with minimal skin contact.<ref name="Mead">{{cite web | author=Mead, Jerry D | date=1997-03-13 | url=http://www.wines.com/winepress/mead/mowi-06.html | title=Mill Creek Revisited | publisher=Mead on Wine | volume=I |issue=6 | accessdate=2008-09-10 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070921043436/http://www.wines.com/winepress/mead/mowi-06.html |archivedate = September 21, 2007}}</ref>  However, in 1975, Trinchero's wine experienced a [[stuck fermentation]], a problem in which the [[yeast (wine)|yeast]] dies off before all the sugar is converted to alcohol.<ref name="Dunne"/> He put the wine aside for two weeks, then tasted it and decided to sell this pinker, sugary wine.<ref name="Murphy" /> Just as [[Mateus Ros<U+00E9>]] had become a huge success in Europe after World War II, this medium [[sweetness in wine|sweet]] White Zinfandel became immensely popular.<ref name="Dunne">{{cite news | author=Dunne, Mike | title=Wines of yesteryear still kicking | publisher=The Sacramento Bee | date=2005-07-29}}</ref> White Zinfandel still accounts for 9.9% of U.S. wine sales by volume (6.3% by value), six times the sales of red Zinfandel.<ref name="USsales"/> Most white Zinfandel is made from grapes grown for that purpose in California's Central Valley.

Wine critics considered white Zinfandel to be insipid and uninteresting in the 1970s and 1980s, although modern white Zinfandels have more fruit and less cloying sweetness.<ref name="Sullivan" /> Nevertheless, the success of this [[Ros<U+00E9>|blush wine]] saved many old vines in premium areas, which came into their own at the end of the 20th century as red Zinfandel wines came back into fashion. Although the two wines taste dramatically different, both are made from the same (red) grapes, processed in a different way.

Dr. Lamberti of Bari had suggested to Goheen in 1976 that Primitivo might be the Croatian variety [[Plavac Mali]].<ref name="Plavac review"/> By 1982 Goheen had confirmed that they were similar but not identical, probably by isozyme analysis.<ref name="Plavac review"/> Some Croatians, however, became convinced that Plavac Mali was the same as Zinfandel, among them Croatian-born winemaker [[Mike Grgich]]. In 1991 Grgich and other producers came together as the Zinfandel Advocates and Producers (ZAP) with the objectives of promoting the varietal and wine, and supporting scientific research on Zinfandel.<ref name="Oxford pg 130 & 786"/> With this support, UCD professor [[Carole Meredith]] went to Croatia and collected over 150 samples of Plavac Mali<ref name="MeredithZAP">{{cite news | author=Meredith, C | url=http://www.zinfandel.org/about_zin/pdf/2002_01_Looking_for_Zin_in_Croatia.pdf | format=PDF | title=Looking for Zinfandel in Croatia | publisher=Zinfandel Express | date=January 2002}}</ref> throughout Dalmatia, in collaboration with the [[University of Zagreb]].<ref name="Plavac review"/>

By 1998, Meredith's team realized that Plavac Mali was ''not'' Zinfandel but rather that one was the parent of the other. In 2000 they discovered that Primitivo/Zinfandel was one parent of Plavac Mali.<ref name="MeredithZAP"/> The other parent of Plavac Mali was determined by Ivan Peji<U+0107> and Edi Maleti<U+0107> (University of Zagreb) to be [[Dobri<U+010D>i<U+0107>]], an ancient variety from the Adriatic island of [[<U+0160>olta]].<ref name="MeredithZAP"/><ref name="Oxford pg 130 &amp; 786"/>

This discovery narrowed down the search to the central [[Dalmatia]]n coastal strip and its offshore [[List of islands of Croatia|islands]]. Eventually a matching DNA fingerprint was found among the samples. The match came from a vine sampled in 2001 in the vineyard of Ivica Raduni<U+0107> in [[Ka<U+0161>tela|Ka<U+0161>tel Novi]].<ref name="MeredithZAP"/> This Crljenak Ka<U+0161>telanski ("Ka<U+0161>tela Red") appears to represent Primitivo/Zinfandel in its original home, although some genetic divergence may have occurred since their separation.

In the 2012 book ''[[Wine Grapes]]'' [[Master of Wine|Masters of wine]] [[Jancis Robinson]] and [[Julia Harding]] and Swiss grape geneticist Dr. [[Jos<U+00E9> Vouillamoz]] detail the search for Zinfandel's origins. After years of research and DNA testing of vines from vineyards across the globe, a single 90 year old grape vine from the garden of an elderly lady in [[Split, Croatia]], provided the evidence to show that Zinfandel was a Croatian grape that has been known as ''Tribidrag'' since at least the 15th century.<ref name="Financial Times"/>

Zinfandel is most widely known in the California wine industry, but the grape is also grown in [[Arizona wine|Arizona]], [[Colorado wine|Colorado]], [[Illinois wine|Illinois]], [[Indiana wine|Indiana]], [[Iowa wine|Iowa]], [[Massachusetts wine|Massachusetts]], [[Nevada wine|Nevada]], [[New Mexico wine|New Mexico]], [[New York wine|New York]], [[North Carolina wine|North Carolina]], [[Ohio wine|Ohio]], [[Oregon wine|Oregon]], [[Tennessee wine|Tennessee]], [[Texas wine|Texas]], [[Washington wine|Washington]],<ref name="Clarke pg 287-294"/> and Oklahoma<ref>http://www.oklahomafood.coop/wineries.php</ref> U.S. producers make wine in styles that range from [[late harvest wine|late harvest]] [[dessert wine]]s, ros<U+00E9>s (White Zinfandel) and [[Beaujolais]]-style light reds to big hearty reds and [[fortified wine]] in the style of [[port wine|port]]. The quality and character of American Zinfandel wines largely depend on the climate and location in which they are grown, the age of the vineyard in which they are grown, and the technology employed by the winemaker.

Historically, California Zinfandel vines were planted as a [[field blend]] interspersed with [[Durif]] (Petite Sirah), [[Carignan]], [[Grenache]], [[Mourv<U+00E8>dre]], [[Mission (grape)|Mission]] and [[Muscat (grape)|Muscat]]. While most vineyards are now fully segregated, California winemakers continue to use other grapes (particularly Petite Sirah) in their Zinfandel wines.<ref name="Clarke pg 287-294"/> Zinfandel is grown on approximately 11% of California's vineyard land area.<ref name="CA area"/> Around 400,000 [[short ton]]s (350,000 [[tonnes]])<!-- Do not remove 'short', it's required by [[MOS:NUM#Unit symbols and abbreviations]] --> are crushed each year, depending on the harvest, placing Zinfandel third behind [[Chardonnay]] and Cabernet Sauvignon and just ahead of [[Merlot]].<ref>{{cite web | last = National Agricultural Statistics Service | title = Grape Crush Report 2006 Table 1 | publisher = USDA | date = 2007-03-10 | url = http://www.nass.usda.gov/Statistics_by_State/California/Publications/Grape_Crush/Final/2006/200603gcbtb01.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2007-12-17 }}</ref>

== Viticulture and winemaking ==
[[Image:Zin barrels.jpg|thumb|right|Zinfandel wine aging in [[barrel]]s.]]
Zinfandel vines are quite vigorous and grow best in climates that are warm but not too hot, because grapes may shrivel in hot weather. Zinfandel's thin-skinned grapes grow in large, tight bunches that are sometimes prone to [[bunch rot]]. The fruit ripen fairly early and produce juice with high sugar levels. If weather conditions permit, the grapes may be [[late harvest wine|late-harvested]] to make [[dessert wine]].<ref name="SLSA" /> Zinfandel is often praised for its ability to reflect both its ''[[terroir]]'' and its winemaker's style and skill.<ref name="Clarke pg 287-294"/>

The grapes are known for their uneven pattern of ripening: a single bunch may contain both raisin-like, over-ripe grapes and green, unripened grapes. Some winemakers choose to [[vinify]] the bunches with these varying levels of ripeness, while others hand-[[harvest (wine)|harvest]] the bunches, even by single berries, through multiple passes through the vineyards over several weeks. This extensively laborious practice is one component in the high cost of some Zinfandels.<ref name="Clarke pg 287-294"/>

Red Zinfandel wines have been criticized for being too "hot" (too alcoholic),<ref name="Sullivan" /> although modern winemaking techniques have helped make them more approachable. On the other hand, Zinfandel producers such as Joel Peterson of Ravenswood believe that alcohol-removing technologies, such as [[reverse osmosis]] and [[spinning cone]]s, remove a sense of [[terroir]] from the wine. If a wine has the tannins and other components to balance 15% alcohol, Peterson argues, it should be accepted on its own terms.<ref name="Peterson"/>

When grapes are harvested, the length of fermentation, the length of the [[maceration (wine)|maceration]] period with skin contact and the level of oak aging affect the wine's taste. The [[degrees Brix]] at which the grapes are harvested dramatically affect the wine's flavor as well. White Zinfandel is normally harvested early at 20<U+00B0>Bx when the grapes have yet to develop much [[Typicity|varietal character]], though some examples can develop hints of tobacco and apple skin. At 23<U+00B0>Bx (the degree that most red wine is considered "ripe"), [[strawberry]] flavors develop. [[Cherry]] flavors appear at 24<U+00B0>Bx followed by blackberry notes at 25<U+00B0>Bx.<ref name="Clarke pg 287-294"/>
