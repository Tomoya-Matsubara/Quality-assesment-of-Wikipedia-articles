'''U.S. Route 222 Business''' ('''US 222 Bus.''') is a {{convert|12.17|mi|km|adj=on}} [[business route]] of [[U.S. Route 222|US 222]] located in [[Reading, Pennsylvania|Reading]], [[Pennsylvania]].  The southern terminus is at US 222 in [[Cumru Township, Berks County, Pennsylvania|Cumru Township]]. Its northern terminus is at US 222 in [[Ontelaunee Township, Berks County, Pennsylvania|Ontelaunee Township]]. The route begins at the US 222 freeway and heads through the southwestern suburbs of Reading as Lancaster Avenue, intersecting [[Pennsylvania Route 724]] (PA 724) in [[Shillington, Pennsylvania|Shillington]]. US 222 Bus. continues into Reading on Lancaster Avenue and intersects the northern termini of [[Pennsylvania Route 625|PA 625]] and [[Pennsylvania Route 10|PA 10]] before reaching an interchange with the [[U.S. Route 422|US 422]] freeway. The business route crosses the [[Schuylkill River]] and becomes Bingaman Street. US 222 Bus. turns north on 5th Street and intersects [[U.S. Route 422 Business (Reading, Pennsylvania)|US 422 Bus.]] in downtown Reading and the southern terminus of [[Pennsylvania Route 61|PA 61]] to the north of downtown. The route interchanges with the [[Pennsylvania Route 12|PA 12]] freeway and continues north through suburban [[Muhlenberg Township, Pennsylvania|Muhlenberg Township]] as 5th Street Highway. US 222 Bus. reaches [[Temple, Pennsylvania|Temple]] and continues northeast to its northern terminus as Allentown Pike. US 222 Bus. is the only auxiliary route of US 222 in Pennsylvania.

With the creation of the [[U.S. Highway System]] in 1926, the road between Reading and [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania|Lancaster]] was designated US 222 while the road between Reading and [[Allentown, Pennsylvania|Allentown]] was part of [[U.S. Route 22 in Pennsylvania|US 22]], which ran along what was designated the [[William Penn Highway]] in 1916 and [[Pennsylvania Route 3 (1920s)|PA 3]] in 1924. In the late 1920s, US 222 briefly ran concurrent with [[Pennsylvania Route 41|PA 41]] and [[Pennsylvania Route 240 (1920s)|PA 240]] at different times. [[Pennsylvania Route 42|PA 42]] originally ran north-south through Reading starting in 1927. By 1930, the concurrent state route designations were removed from US 222 and US 22. US 222 entered Reading along with [[Pennsylvania Route 73|PA 73]] along Lancaster Avenue and Bingaman Street before turning north on 9th Street along with [[Pennsylvania Route 83|PA 83]] to end at US 22 and US 422 at Penn Street. US 22 continued north on 9th Street out of Reading and continued along Kutztown Road through Temple toward Allentown. [[U.S. Route 120|US 120]] began at US 222 at Bingaman Street and headed north on 4th Street and Center Street out of Reading. In 1931, US 22 was moved to a more direct alignment between [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]] and Allentown, and US 222 was extended north along the former alignment between Reading and Allentown. US 222 was shifted to use Lancaster Avenue, Bingaman Street, and 5th Street and 5th Street Highway through the Reading area in the 1930s, running concurrent with [[U.S. Route 122 (1935<U+2013>1963)|US 122]] through downtown Reading. The US 122 and PA 73 concurrencies were removed by 1966. In 1975, US 222 was rerouted to bypass Reading on the West Shore Bypass and the Warren Street Bypass, with the former alignment through the city becoming US 222 Bus. In 1998, US 222 Bus. was extended north to its current terminus following the rerouting of US 222 to a new outer bypass of Reading. The business route was extended south to its current endpoint in 2004 with the completion of the US 222 freeway south of Reading to [[Mohnton, Pennsylvania|Mohnton]].

US 222 Bus. begins at an interchange with the [[U.S. Route 222|US 222]] freeway near [[Mohnton, Pennsylvania|Mohnton]] in [[Cumru Township, Pennsylvania|Cumru Township]], [[Berks County, Pennsylvania|Berks County]], with access from the northbound lanes and access to the southbound lanes. From this interchange, the business route heads northeast on Lancaster Avenue, a four-lane road with one northbound lane, two southbound lanes, and a [[center left-turn lane]] that passes a mix of homes and businesses. The road passes through the community of [[Montrose, Berks County, Pennsylvania|Montrose]] before it comes to an intersection with [[Pennsylvania Route 724|PA 724]], where it widens to a four-lane [[divided highway]]. At this point, PA 724 turns east to form a [[concurrency (road)|concurrency]] with US 222 Bus. on Lancaster Avenue, a five-lane road with a center left-turn lane. The road briefly runs along the border between the borough of [[Wyomissing, Pennsylvania|Wyomissing]] to the north and Cumru Township to the south before it enters the borough of [[Shillington, Pennsylvania|Shillington]], where it narrows to a two-lane undivided road past homes and some businesses that runs east-southeast. US 222 Bus. splits from PA 724 by continuing northeast on Lancaster Avenue, a three-lane road with a center left-turn lane that passes through residential areas with some commercial establishments.

This one-way pairing passes through urban neighborhoods. Both directions of US 222 Bus. rejoin and the route continues north on South 5th Street, a three-lane road with two northbound lanes and one southbound lane. The road passes more urban homes before heading into the commercial downtown of Reading, where it intersects the eastbound direction of [[U.S. Route 422 Business (Reading, Pennsylvania)|US 422 Bus.]] at Franklin Street. After this, the route widens to four lanes and comes to the Penn Street intersection, where the name changes to North 5th Street. US 222 Bus. crosses the westbound direction of US 422 Bus. at Washington Street and heads out of the downtown area, continuing past urban [[rowhome]]s as a three-lane road with two northbound lanes and one southbound lane. The route intersects the beginning of northbound [[Pennsylvania Route 61|PA 61]] at Centre Avenue and comes to a bridge over Norfolk Southern's Harrisburg Line before it has a junction with the end of southbound PA 61 at Greenwich Street. The road narrows to two lanes and continues north, lined with homes. The route passes between a large cemetery to the west and neighborhoods to the east before it widens to four lanes and heads into commercial areas. US 222 Bus. passes under Norfolk Southern's [[Reading Line]] and widens into a divided highway, leaving Reading for [[Muhlenberg Township, Pennsylvania|Muhlenberg Township]] as it to an interchange with the [[Pennsylvania Route 12|PA 12]] freeway ([[Warren Street Bypass]]).<ref name=gm/><ref name=PennDOTBerks/>

After the PA 12 interchange, the business route continues north as a four-lane divided highway called North 5th Street Highway through a mix of residential and commercial areas in the community of [[Hyde Villa, Pennsylvania|Hyde Villa]].

==History==
When Pennsylvania first legislated routes in 1911, the route heading southwest out of Reading toward [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania|Lancaster]] was legislated as Legislative Route 148 while the route heading from Reading northeast toward [[Allentown, Pennsylvania|Allentown]] was legislated as Legislative Route 157.<ref name="PennDOT 1911">{{cite map|publisher=[[Pennsylvania Department of Highways]]|title=Map of Pennsylvania Showing State Highways| url=ftp://ftp.dot.state.pa.us/public/pdf/BPR_pdf_files/Maps/Statewide/Historic_OTMs/1911.pdf|year=1911|accessdate=December 14, 2014}}</ref> In 1916, the road between Reading and Allentown became a part of the [[William Penn Highway]], an [[auto trail]] that ran from [[Pittsburgh]] to [[New York City]]. In 1924, the William Penn Highway was designated as [[Pennsylvania Route 3 (1920s)|PA 3]] with the establishment of the first state route numbers in Pennsylvania.<ref name=fed>{{cite web|url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/us22.htm|title=William Penn Highway: US 22 in Pennsylvania|work=[[Federal Highway Administration]]|accessdate=2007-06-26}}</ref> With the establishment of the [[U.S. Highway System]] in 1926, the route heading from Reading southwest to Lancaster was designated as US 222 while the route heading from Reading to Allentown along the William Penn Highway was designated as part of [[U.S. Route 22 in Pennsylvania|US 22]], which ran concurrent with PA 3.<ref name=1926map>{{cite map|url=http://www.mapsofpa.com/art5pics/251c.jpg|title=Pennsylvania Highway Map (eastern side)|publisher=[[Gulf Oil]]|year=1926|accessdate=December 26, 2007}}</ref><ref name="USHM">{{cite map|  publisher=[[Bureau of Public Roads]] |title=United States System of Highways |url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:1926us.jpg |year=1926 |accessdate=2009-04-27}}</ref> In 1927, [[Pennsylvania Route 41|PA 41]] was designated concurrent with US 222 between Lancaster and Reading and [[Pennsylvania Route 42|PA 42]] ran north-south through downtown Reading.<ref>{{cite map|url=http://www.mapsofpa.com/roadcart/1927_2043m.jpg|title=Pennsylvania Highway Map|publisher=Pennsylvania Department of Highways|year=1927|accessdate=December 26, 2007}}</ref> A year later, the concurrent PA 41 designation along US 222 between Lancaster and Reading was replaced with [[Pennsylvania Route 240 (1920s)|PA 240]]. In addition, [[Pennsylvania Route 73|PA 73]] ran concurrent with US 222/PA 240 between New Holland Avenue, where it split south, and downtown Reading.<ref name=1928map>{{cite map|url=http://www.mapsofpa.com/art5pics/1928phila3.jpg|title=Pennsylvania Highway Map (Philadelphia Metro)|year=1928|publisher=[[Gulf Oil]]|accessdate=November 8, 2007}}</ref> By 1930, the concurrent PA 240 designation was removed from US 222 while the concurrent PA 3 designation was removed from US 22. At this time, US 222 entered Reading on Lancaster Avenue, where it became concurrent with PA 73 at New Holland Avenue and interseced the northern terminus of PA 42 at Morgantown Road. US 222/PA 73 crossed the Schuylkill River on Bingaman Street and intersected the southern terminus of [[U.S. Route 120|US 120]], which headed north on 4th Street and Center Street, and continued northeast to intersect [[Pennsylvania Route 83|PA 83]] at 9th Street. Here, PA 73 continued northeast on Bingaman Street and US 222 turned north concurrent with PA 83 on 9th Street to reach its northern terminus at US 22 and US 422 at Penn Street. At this intersection, PA 83 turned west along with US 22 on Penn Street and US 22 continued north along 9th Street out of Reading, where it continued north through South Temple and Temple on Kutztown Road.<ref name="PennDOT 1930">{{cite map|publisher=Pennsylvania Department of Highways|title=Tourist Map of Pennsylvania| url=ftp://ftp.dot.state.pa.us/public/pdf/BPR_pdf_files/Maps/Statewide/Historic_OTMs/1930fr.pdf|year=1930|accessdate=December 16, 2014}}</ref><ref name="PennDOT 1930 back">{{cite map|publisher=Pennsylvania Department of Highways|title=Tourist Map of Pennsylvania (back)| url=ftp://ftp.dot.state.pa.us/public/pdf/BPR_pdf_files/Maps/Statewide/Historic_OTMs/1930bk.pdf|year=1930|accessdate=January 8, 2015}}</ref>

In 1931, plans were made to reroute US 22 and the William Penn Highway to a more direct alignment between [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]] and Allentown by way of [[Pennsylvania Route 43 (1920s)|PA 43]]. As a result of the rerouting of US 22, the road between Harrisburg and Reading would become a western extension of US 422 while the road between Reading and Allentown would become a northern extension of US 222. The changes were approved by the [[American Association of State Highway Officials]] on June 8, 1931.<ref name=fed/> In the 1930s, US 222 was shifted to follow 5th Street north through Reading and 5th Street Highway through Muhlenberg Township. [[U.S. Route 122 (1935<U+2013>1963)|US 122]] replaced the PA 42 designation south of Reading and the US 120 designation north of Reading and was routed to run concurrent with US 222 on Lancaster Avenue, Bingaman Street, and 5th Street between Morgantown Road and Center Street.<ref name="PennDOT 1940">{{cite map|publisher=Pennsylvania Department of Highways|title=Official Road Map of Pennsylvania| url=ftp://ftp.dot.state.pa.us/public/pdf/BPR_pdf_files/Maps/Statewide/Historic_OTMs/1940fr.pdf|year=1940|accessdate=June 24, 2010}}</ref><ref name="PennDOT 1940 back">{{cite map|publisher=Pennsylvania Department of Highways|title=Official Road Map of Pennsylvania (back)| url=ftp://ftp.dot.state.pa.us/public/pdf/BPR_pdf_files/Maps/Statewide/Historic_OTMs/1940bk.pdf|year=1940|accessdate=January 1, 2014}}</ref> By 1966, the US 122 and PA 73 concurrencies were removed from US 222 through Reading.<ref name=1966berks>{{cite map|url=ftp://ftp.dot.state.pa.us/public/pdf/BPR_PDF_FILES/Maps/Type_10_GHS_Historical_Scans/Berks_1966_Sheet_1.pdf|publisher=Pennsylvania Department of Transportation|year=1966|title=General Highway Map Berks County, Pennsylvania Sheet 1|accessdate=December 14, 2012}}</ref> US 222 was split into a one-way pair along 5th Street northbound and 4th Street southbound between Laurel and Chestnut streets.<ref name="PennDOT 1970 back">{{cite map|publisher=[[Pennsylvania Department of Transportation]]|title=Official Map of Pennsylvania (back)| url=ftp://ftp.dot.state.pa.us/public/pdf/BPR_pdf_files/Maps/Statewide/Historic_OTMs/1970bk.pdf|year=1970|accessdate=December 16, 2014}}</ref>

On November 15, 1975, the [[American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials]] (AASHTO) approved rerouting US 222 to bypass downtown Reading to the west along the limited-access West Shore Bypass (where it ran concurrent with US 422) and the Warren Street Bypass.
