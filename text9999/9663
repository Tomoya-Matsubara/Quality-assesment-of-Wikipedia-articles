'''Alastis''' are a [[black metal]] band formed in [[1987]] in 
[[Sion, Switzerland]]. 

Much like their fellow countrymen [[Samael (band)|Samael]], gothic and industrial musical elements played an important role in their sound during their later career, starting as a raw black metal before signing to [[Century Media]] records. Coincidentally, [[Samael (band)|Samael]]'s current vocalist/guitarist Vorph did vocals on the demo ''Black Wedding (1990)'', and Masmiseim (''b. Christophe Mermod'') had played [[bass guitar|bass]] for the group before joining [[Samael (band)|Samael]] in [[1992]]. Former Alastis drummer Acronoise (''b. Laurent Mermod'') is also Masmiseim's brother.[http://www.bnrmetal.com/groups/alss.htm]

Their last album was ''Unity'', released in 2001. No press or news release has been available since, and sources differ widely as to the current status of the band.
