The '''101st Intelligence Squadron''' is a unit of the [[Massachusetts Air National Guard]]. It was formed at [[Kelly Field]] in [[Texas]] in 1921. Its parent unit is the [[102nd Intelligence Wing]].

==Mission==

==History==
===Origins===
The '''101st Aero Squadron''' was formed as [[Kelly Field]] in 1917. While deployed to France during [[World War I]], it was renamed the '''639th Aero Squadron'''. It came back to the United States in 1919. The [[101st Observation Squadron]] was formed in the spring of 1921, the squadron being federally recognized on November 18th. The '''639th Aero Squadron''' was merged into it during this creation. It was part of the [[26th Infantry Division (United States)|26th Infantry Division]]. Originally, it did not receive its own [[JN-4D Jenny]] aircraft for over a year. The original home for the 101st was [[Jeffery Field]], a small field with two cinder runways. The 101st actually had to raise $15,000 so that it could complete the runways.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mass.gov/guard/museum/airhistory.htm|title=Commonwealth of Massachusetts Military Division, Air National Guard History|accessdate=2008-05-29|publisher=National Guard Museum & Archives|date=5/29/08}}</ref> Nevertheless, the 101st drilled weekly and Jennies were always available for pilots to fly. The 101st additionally raised public awareness of military aviation throughout New England through its actions. Jennies were flown at air shows, county fairs and other events. In addition, the 101st attended two-week summer camps. Pilots flew their [[Curtiss O-11]]s to temporary fields on Cape Cod while ground crews followed in trucks. One of these fields was [[Cape Cod Airport]]. In 1933, the 101st occupied new hangers and administrative buildings at [[Logan Airport]]. The 101st was ordered into state service in 1936 and 1938 during a devastating flood and hurricane to fly observation missions and to drop food and equipment to stranded fishermen and the residents of [[Isle au Haut]], [[Maine]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mass.gov/guard/museum/airhistory.htm|title=Commonwealth of Massachusetts Military Division, Air National Guard History|accessdate=2008-05-29|publisher=National Guard Museum & Archives|date=5/29/08}}</ref> The 101st helped gained fame when it played a big part in the [[U.S. Army Air Service]]'s flight around the world. It then cared for the [[Spirit of St. Louis]] when [[Charles Lindbergh]] visited the state.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mass.gov/guard/museum/airhistory.htm|title=Commonwealth of Massachusetts Military Division, Air National Guard History|accessdate=2008-05-29|publisher=National Guard Museum & Archives|date=5/29/08}}</ref>

===World War II===
In 1940, the 101st was the 101st separated from the [[26th Infantry Division (United States)|26th Infantry Division]] and in November was ordered into active Federal service for intensive training. Initially the 101st<U+2019>s 25 officers and 133 enlisted men remained at home station until [[July 31]] [[1941]] when it was then moved from [[Logan Airport]] to [[Otis Field]] at [[Camp Edwards]]. [[Otis Field]] was named in after 1st Lt Frank J. Otis, Jr., MD, a 101st flight surgeon who killed in a flight accident in 1938. The 101st participated in the North Carolina maneuvers in the fall of 1941 and returned to [[Otis Field]] on [[December 6]] [[1941]]. With the outbreak of World War II, the 101st was assigned to fly [[anti-submarine]] patrols off the coast of [[New England]] until [[September 10]] [[1942]]. By then many of its original members has been reassigned during the expansion of the [[Army Air Forces]]. During the next two years, the 101st was transferred to several bases and on 20 May 1944 had its mission changed when it was re designated as the '''39th Photo Reconnaissance Squadron'''. It was then placed under the command of the [[Ninth Air Force]]. As the 39th, the squadron deployed to the European Theater in December, 1944 with 45 officers and 297 enlisted men. The 39th flew both P-38s and P-51s during operational missions from January, 1945 to the end of the war in May. The 39th returned to the states in August, 1945 and was re designated as the '''101st Fighter Squadron''' in May, 1946 and inactivated two month later. During the summer of 1946, 101st veterans and [[Army Air Force]] veterans reorganized the 101st at [[Logan Airport]]. The squadron was equipped with the [[P-47 Thunderbolt]] and was Federally recognized on 15 Oct. 1946.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mass.gov/guard/museum/airhistory.htm|title=Commonwealth of Massachusetts Military Division, Air National Guard History|accessdate=2008-05-29|publisher=National Guard Museum & Archives|date=5/29/08}}</ref>

===Cold War===
After the end of the war, the 101st moved to [[Logan International Airport]]. The '''102nd Fighter Group''' was formed in 1946 and assigned to the [[Massachusetts Air National Guard]]. The 101st immediately fell under the command of the 102nd. In 1950, the 102nd was recalled to active duty and assigned to the [[Air Defense Command]]. Remaining at home station, the wing stood on runway alert throughout the [[Korean conflict]]. From 1956 to 1976, the 102nd was headed by [[Brigadier General Charles W. Sweeney]], who piloted the [[B-29 Superfortress]], which dropped the [[Fat Man]] atomic bomb on [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki, Japan]] in 1945.

===Berlin Crisis===
During the summer of 1961, as the [[Berlin Crisis]] unfolded, several USAF reserve units were notified on [[16 August]] of their pending activation and recall to active duty.  On October 1st, the [[Massachusetts Air National Guard]]'s '''102nd Tactical Fighter Wing''' and the [[101st Tactical Fighter Squadron]] along with the [[131st Tactical Fighter Squadron]], and [[138th Tactical Fighter Squadron]] went on active duty at [[Otis Air Force Base]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.102ndfighterwing.com/otis_web_history.htm|title=102nd Intelligence Wing History|accessdate=2008-05-29|publisher=The 102nd Fighter Wing & 101st Fighter Squadron|date=5/29/08}}</ref>

Between the 28th and 30th of October, the 102nd TFW departed [[Logan International Airport]] to [[Phalsbourg]].  By [[November 1]], 26 of the wing<U+2019>s [[F-86H Sabre]] aircraft were on the ramp at [[Phalsbourg-Bourscheid Air Base]], France. The wing deployed 82 [[F-86H Sabre]]s.  The 101st's planes were marked with green stripes on their vertical stabilizers.

The 102nd's primary mission at the time was to provide close air support to [[NATO]] ground forces and air interdiction.  This involved keeping its aircraft on 24/7 alert.  Starting on December 5th, the 101st began deploying to [[Wheelus Air Base]], [[Libya]] for gunnery training.

During its time in Europe, the 101st participated in several [[USAF]] and [[NATO]] exercises, including a deployment to [[Leck Air Base]], [[West Germany]] near the Danish border.  At Leck, ground and support crews from both countries exchanged duties, learning how to perform aircraft maintenance and operational support tasks.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.102ndfighterwing.com/otis_web_history.htm|title=102nd Intelligence Wing History|accessdate=2008-05-29|publisher=The 102nd Fighter Wing & 101st Fighter Squadron|date=5/29/08}}</ref>

On [[May 7]] [[1962]], the '''Seventeenth Air Force''' stated that the 102nd TFW would deploy back to [[CONUS]] during the summer, and the 102nd TFW returned to the [[United States]] in July of 1962,  Regular USAF personnel, along with a group of ANG personnel who volunteered to remain on active duty formed the [[480th Tactical Fighter Squadron]] of the newly activated [[366th Tactical Fighter Wing]].

===102nd Moves to Otis===
[[Image:too-102fw.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Older emblem of the 102nd]]
In 1968, the 102nd Tactical Fighter Wing moved to [[Otis Air Force Base]]. The move to Otis for the 102nd was fitting. The [[101st Observation Squadron]], forerunner of the 102nd Fighter Interceptor Wing, was the original occupant of the [[Otis Field]] and was instrumental in its construction on the [[Camp Edwards]] property. The original intent of [[Otis Field]] was for utilization by [[National Guard]] aircraft.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mass.gov/guard/museum/airhistory.htm|title=Commonwealth of Massachusetts Military Division, Air National Guard History|accessdate=2008-05-29|publisher=National Guard Museum & Archives|date=5/29/08}}</ref> The squadron flew the [[F-84F Thunderstreak]] until June 1971, when a squadron of [[F-100D Super Sabres]] was transferred directly from units fighting the [[Vietnam War]]. After making the transition to the "Hun," a shift in [[United States Department of Defense]] military planning brought still more change to the 101st and its' mission. The Mach 2 [[F-106 Delta Darts]] soon arrived on the 101st's parking ramp. On [[June 10]] [[1972]], the unit officially became the '''101st Air Defense Squadron'''. Upon completion of transition, the squadron commenced an air defense alert commitment on a 24-hour, 365-days-a-year basis. The squadron participated in the interception of Soviet [[TU-95 Bear]] bombers on many occasions, the first of which occurred off [[Long Island]] in 1975. Many of these occasions included escorting the aircraft to [[Cuba]]. Other escort missions involved the escorting of drug smuggling planes and the identifying of one mysterious ghost plane, which turned out later to be a weather balloon..<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2008/01/25/otis_sees_its_last_landing/|title=Otis See Its Last Landing|accessdate=2008-05-29|publisher=Boston News|date=5/29/08}}</ref> In 1972, the [[101st Fighter Interceptor Squadron]], was placed on an air defense alert mission. This mission was continued right up to [[January 24]] [[2008]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.philippecolin.net/102ndFW.html|title=The 102nd Fighter Wing|accessdate=2008-05-29|publisher=Philippe Colin|date=1/22/08}}</ref> It was also the first Air National Guard unit to received the [[F-15 Eagle]].

===Post-Cold War===
[[Image:070606-F-0894S-166.jpg|right|300px|thumb|F-15's From Otis]]
The squadron continued air defense mission after the fall of the [[Soviet Union]]. Examples of this include a 1992 deployment of eight pilots, five F-15 Eagles, and 48 maintenance and security personnel, for five days to [[Canadian Forces Base Goose Bay]], [[Labrador, Canada]]. Another is the humanitarian deployment of 50 personnel from the '''102nd Civil Engineering Squadron''' under field conditions, to the island of [[Eleuthera]] in the [[Bahamas]] in July 1993. They helped to rebuild school buildings and municipal facilities that were damaged by [[Hurricane Andrew]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/usaf/102fw.htm|title=Global Security History of the 102nd Fighter Wing|accessdate=2008-05-29|publisher=Global Security|date=5/29/08}}</ref> During the years of 1991 through 1995 the wing deployed to [[Panama]] as part of [[Operation Coronet Nighthawk]], a drug interdiction operation. From 1995-1998 the squadron deployed to [[Iceland]] for 45 days of air defense duty. During 1998 members both trained for and performed in real-world contingency assignments in [[Iceland]], [[Canada]], [[Korea]], and [[Europe]]. In 1999 the squadron also participated in [[Operation Northern Watch]] when it deployed with its F-15 Eagle aircraft to [[Turkey]] to patrol and enforce the no-fly zone north of the 36th Parallel in northern [[Iraq]]. The squadron again deployed more than 350 personnel to the [[Middle East]] and [[Europe]] in 2000 to participate in [[Operation Southern Watch]].

===Global War on Terror===
[[Image:011106-F-4308R-004.jpg|right|thumb|F-15 Over New York City after 9/11]]
On [[September 11, 2001]], the squadron sprang into action just minutes after the terrorists attacks on the [[World Trade Center]] in [[New York City]]. More than 600 wing members were mobilized for [[Operation Noble Eagle]]. The wing began flying around-the-clock [[combat air patrols]] missions immediately thereafter, and continued doing so until February 2002. Overall during 2001, squadron aircraft flew 2,388 sorties compiling more than 3750 flying hours.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.maotis.ang.af.mil/COMMANDERPOLICYSTATEMENTApril2008.pdf |title=Commander Environmental Statement|accessdate=2008-05-29|publisher=102IW Public Affairs office|date=1/22/08}}</ref> Furthermore, the squadron escorted the plane that carried shoe bomber [[Richard Reid]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.102ndfighterwing.com/otis_web_history.htm|title=102nd Intelligence Wing History|accessdate=2008-05-29|publisher=The 102nd Fighter Wing & 101st Fighter Squadron|date=5/29/08}}</ref>

===BRAC 2005===
The BRAC 2005 commission originally planned to close the base and dissolve the fighter wing and squadron. Locals argued that this would leave a huge gap in the national air defenses and they were right. They also argued that the fighter jets had also been the first to scramble during 9/11. BRAC officials, after visiting the base, decided to keep it open and keep the wing but the 102nd would still lose its planes, only this time they were only going to the [[104th Fighter Wing]], based at [[Barnes Municipal Airport]]. Some people were willing to see the base closed but many in the community have gotten so used to the sound of the jets that they really did not want to see them go.
[[Image:DSC00772.jpg|left|thumb|F-15 From 101st Fighter Interception Squadron during the 2007 Cape Cod Airshow]]
The 102nd hosted its last airshow with the F-15 during the tail end of Air Force Week. The wing also shared the last months with its aircraft with the [[101st Air Refueling Wing]], and the [[103rd Fighter Wing]], and the [[104th Fighter Wing]]. The three wings lost and gained new aircraft with the decisions that BRAC made. Beginning in 2007, planes started transitioning to [[Barnes Municipal Airport]]. With the grounding of the [[F-15 Eagles]], the [[158th Fighter Wing]], which is based in [[Vermont]] temporarily took over the role of patrolling the Northeast's skies. This interruption of the flying of the planes, coinciding with the transitioning of the fighter jets to the [[104th Fighter Wing]], created some issues. The move was scheduled to be completed at the end of January, but the grounding of the F-15's in 2007 and early 2008 delayed this move to the end of February.

===Final Flight===
On [[January 24]] [[2008]], the '''101st Intelligence Squadron''' officially flew its last patrol mission. After 35 years of being on constant alert status, the squadron was officially ordered to stand down. The unit's wing commander, Colonel Anthony Schiavi, led the flight, accompanied by Major Daniel Nash, who was one of the first responders for 9/11. Fire trucks were on hand when the team landed a half-hour later, giving the planes and the pilots the customary ceremonial hose-down for the last time. The wing was responsible for airspace spanning the area from the Canadian border to [[Washington D.C.]], about {{convert|500000|sqmi|km2}} of area. The 87 years of the [[101st Fighter Squadron]]'s flying mission came to an end on that day. Those years are now a memory as the squadron is now without a flying mission.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2008/01/25/otis_sees_its_last_landing/|title=Otis See Its Last Landing|accessdate=2008-05-29|publisher=Boston News|date=5/29/08}}</ref>

===New Mission===
As soon as it was announced that the squadron would be kept alive and [[Otis Air National Guard Base]] would remain open, people began thinking of the future for the 101st and 102nd. There was talk that the wing could transition to an intelligence mission so that it could help support the growing [[War On Terror]]. The plans hit a roadblock when it was announced that there were few funds left with which the squadron could use to transition into its new mission.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.capecodonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070602/NEWS/706020341 |title= CapeCodTimes.com - New Otis mission in limbo |accessdate=2008-05-29|publisher= Cape Cod Times|date=5/29/08}}</ref>
The new mission was finally confirmed when Governor [[Deval Patrick]] announced that the wing would transition to an intelligence mission as soon as the planes left. Original BRAC plans only said that a [[Distributed Common Ground Station]] would be created at Otis. This didn't include the air guardsmen affected by the loss of their jobs. The issue was finally resolved when the Air Force announced its plans, right before the F-15's started to leave for Barnes. Some guardsmen and women have decided to stay with the 102nd so that they would not have to uproot their lives and move to the other side of the state. Others have decided to follow the F-15's to Barnes and continue on with their flying careers. Those that have stayed are currently being retrained so that they can have an important part in the future of our nation. There are currently no known plans on the table, which would include the wing flying again. On [[April 1]] [[2008]], the '''101st Fighter Squadron''' was re designated as the '''101st Intelligence Squadron'''. The formal ceremony to celebrate this change was held on April 6th. The buildings that are being converted will start being ready soon and the squadron will reach full operation in 2010.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.capecodonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080407/NEWS/804070326|title=A change of the Guard at Otis|accessdate=May 29, 2008|publisher=Massachusetts National Guard|date=4/7/08}}</ref> By October 1st, 2008, the squadron is expected to be operationally ready.
