'''The Manchester Rambler''', also known as '''I'm a Rambler''' and '''The Rambler's song''', is a song written by the English folk singer [[Ewan MacColl]]. It was inspired by his participation in the [[Kinder trespass]], a protest by the urban [[Young Communist League]] of [[Manchester]], and was the work that began MacColl's career as a singer/songwriter.

==Context==

The [[Kinder mass trespass]] was a deliberate act of [[trespass]] by men of the [[Young Communist League]] of [[Manchester]]. The '[[walking#As a leisure activity|rambler]]s', led by [[Benny Goodman]], walked from  Bowden Bridge Quarry, near [[Hayfield]] to climb the hill called [[Kinder Scout]] in the [[Derbyshire]] [[Peak District]] on 24 April 1932. MacColl was a keen rambler and an enthusiastic member of the Young Communist League. He played a major part in organising the publicity for the trespass, duplicating and handing out leaflets, though this role is disputed.<ref name=KinderTrespass>{{cite web|title=Conflict and Controversy|url=http://kindertrespass.com/index.asp?ID=196|website=Kinder trespass|publisher=Kinder Visitor Centre Group|accessdate=3 November 2014}}</ref> He took part in the trespass, and was shocked by the violent reaction of the [[gamekeeper]]s who met the ramblers on the hill, and the extremely harsh sentences handed down by the magistrates to the five ramblers who were arrested that day.<ref name=BBC-Derby>{{cite web |title=Kinder Mass Trespass 'should be taught in schools' |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-derbyshire-17863086 |website=BBC News |publisher=BBC |accessdate=3 November 2014}}</ref><ref name=BBC-Manchester>{{cite web |last1=Long |first1=Chris |title=How trespassing 'crystallised' Ewan MacColl's songwriting |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-17783987 |website=BBC News |publisher=BBC |accessdate=3 November 2014}}</ref>

In his biographer Ben Harker's view, "it would be difficult to overstate the extent to which MacColl was shaped by the 1930s".<ref name=Harker>{{cite journal | url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/25472794 | title='The Manchester Rambler': Ewan MacColl and the 1932 Mass Trespass | author=Harker, Ben | journal=History Workshop Journal |date=Spring 2005 | issue=59 | pages=219<U+2013>228}}</ref> MacColl was a keen rambler, travelling out of Manchester by bus into the Peak District, like thousands of other young unemployed people with time on their hands. For MacColl, rambling was integral to his politics; he did not simply find nature beautiful and the urban world ugly: instead, it was an objective of the hoped-for revolution<ref name=Harker/>

{{quote|to create a world that would harmonize with that other one that you enjoyed so much... If the bourgeoisie had had any sense at all they would never have allowed the working class into that kind of countryside. Because it bred a spirit of revolt.<ref name=Harker/>}}

Groups of ramblers often sang songs such as "I'm Happy When I'm Hiking", as well as bawdy songs, ballads and radical protest songs from America at their camps. MacColl published the "Manchester Youth Song" in 1933, singing of "Workers in Cheetham, who slave every day / In waterproof factories at starvation pay".<ref name=Harker/> He also wrote the song "Mass Trespass 1932", setting words like "For the mass trespass is the only way there is / To gain access to the mountains once again" to the old Scottish tune of "[[The Road to the Isles]]". His friends used to sing it as they rambled in the hills.<ref name=Harker/>

==Folk song==

The Manchester Rambler, written in 1932 not long after the Kinder trespass, was [[Ewan MacColl]]'s first important song, according to Harker,<ref name=BBC-Manchester/> who argues that it "marks a departure from the [singer's] leaden-footed and slogan-heavy juvenilia."<ref name=Harker/> It is also the first song that still survives for which he wrote the tune. Its swinging, jaunty melody demonstrates MacColl's ability to combine musical forms and popular rhythms to create a song which is at once familiar and unique. Like the tune, the lyrics are witty and playful. They put out a defiant political message with "I may be a wage slave on Monday / But I am a free man on Sunday"; play with and update traditional English folksong phraseology with "I once loved a maid, a spot-welder by trade / She was fair as the Rowan in bloom"; and is suitably comical in the style of musical theatre, argues Harker, on the confrontation between the ramblers and the gamekeepers with lines such as "He called me a louse and said 'Think of the grouse'".<ref name=Harker/><ref name=Lyrics>{{cite web |title=Ewan MacColl: The Manchester Rambler: Lyrics |url=http://www.allmusic.com/song/the-manchester-rambler-mt0012266171/lyrics |publisher=AllMusic |accessdate=3 November 2014}}</ref> The song has 5 verses, each of 8 lines, and a 4-line chorus.<ref name=Lyrics/>

The song names the following places: [[Mount Snowdon|Snowdon]] (North Wales); [[Crowdon]] ([[North Yorkshire]]); the Wainstones ([[Hasty Bank]], [[North York Moors]]); Kinder Scout; Manchester; Grindsbrook and Upper Tor (both [[Edale]], Derbyshire).<ref name=Lyrics/>

The Manchester Rambler is published by Green Linnet on Ewan MacColl's 1996 CD "Black and White: The Definitive Collection", also released by Cooking Vinyl Records; the recording lasts 4 minutes 42 seconds.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ewan MacColl: Black and White: The Definitive Collection: Releases|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/black-and-white-the-definitive-collection-mw0000677582/releases|publisher=AllMusic}}</ref>

==Reception==

Ben Harker said of The Manchester Rambler that

{{quote|Rambler is the song where it all comes together. He'd written these rather earnest agitprop pieces prior to that, but in Rambler, he manages to pull together a political perspective with a more lyrical style... It crystallises his songwriting and that's the first time it happens.<ref name=BBC-Manchester/>}}

MacColl performed the song as a standard all his life.<ref name=Harker/> Cover versions were performed and recorded by dozens of folk musicians from the 1950s onwards,<ref name=Harker/> including for example "[[Alive Alive-O]]"<ref>{{cite web |title=Alive-Alive-O |url=http://itsthedubliners.com/dubs_d48_alive_o.htm |website=It's The Dubliners |accessdate=3 November 2014}}</ref> and ''[[30 Years A-Greying]]''<ref>{{cite web |title=30 Years A-Greying |url=http://itsthedubliners.com/dubs_d46_30_Years.htm |website=It's The Dubliners |accessdate=3 November 2014}}</ref> by [[The Dubliners]]. [[Kirsty MacColl]] (daughter of Ewan) covered the song on her 1991 album ''The One And Only''.<ref>{{cite web|last1=MacColl|first1=Kirsty|title=The One And Only|url=http://www.kirstymaccoll.com/songs/kirsty-songs/the-one-and-only/|accessdate=3 November 2014}}</ref> [[The Houghton Weavers]] covered it on their 2005 album "Sit Thi Deawn".<ref>{{cite web |title=Houghton Weavers, The <U+2013> Sit Thi Deawn |url=http://www.discogs.com/Houghton-Weavers-Sit-Thi-Deawn/release/3237825  |website=Discogs |accessdate=3 November 2014}}</ref> Mick Groves performed it on his 2005 album "Fellow Journeyman".<ref>{{cite web|title=MICK GROVES - Fellow Journeyman: The Songs of Ewan MacColl|url=http://www.folkmusic.net/htmfiles/webrevs/exeg1.htm|website=Folkmusic.net|accessdate=3 November 2014}}</ref>

The ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'' writes of MacColl that "One of his first and finest protest songs, <U+2018>The Manchester Rambler<U+2019>, dealt with the <U+2018>mass trespass<U+2019> campaigns of the 1930s, in which hikers fought pitched battles with gamekeepers when they invaded privately owned grouse moors."<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last1=Denselow |first1=Robin |work=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |date=2004 |publisher=Oxford University Press |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/templates/article.jsp?articleid=40664&back-title=Ewan |accessdate=3 November 2014 |title=MacColl, Ewan (1915-1989) |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/40664}}</ref>

The ''Encyclopaedia of Contemporary British Culture'' describes Ewan MacColl as "a crucial figure" in the folk revival of the 1950s and 1960s, and names The Manchester Rambler as one of his "more famous songs".<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Childs |editor1-first=Peter |editor2-last=Storry |editor2-first=Michael |title=Encyclopaedia of Contemporary British Culture  |date=2013 |publisher=Routledge |page=202 |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tlsKXeRt0wgC&pg=PA202&lpg=PA202 |chapter=Folk Music}}</ref>

The song was sung at Kinder Downfall (the waterfall on Kinder Scout) in 2009 when Kinder was designated as a [[National Nature Reserve]] (NNR); in attendance were establishment figures including three [[Members of Parliament]], the [[Chief Executive Officer]]s of three [[National Park]]s and the leaders of [[Natural England]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Turnbull|first1=Dave|title=https://www.thebmc.co.uk/kinder-designated-as-new-national-nature-reserve|url=https://www.thebmc.co.uk/kinder-designated-as-new-national-nature-reserve|publisher=British Mountaineering Council|accessdate=3 November 2014|date=12 October 2009}}</ref> The [[British Mountaineering Council]]'s booklet issued in 2012 to commemorate 80 years of the Kinder mass trespass reproduced the lyrics of The Manchester Rambler in full.<ref>{{cite web |title=Kinder 80: Trespass to Treasure |url=https://www.thebmc.co.uk/media/files/access/trespass%20booklet.pdf |publisher=British Mountaineering Council |accessdate=3 November 2014 |ref=BMC |date=2012}}</ref>
