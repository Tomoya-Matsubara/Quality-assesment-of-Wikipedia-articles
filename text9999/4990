==Critical reception==
The film received mixed reviews upon release. Kiran Joseph JKV wrote in his review for ''[[Deccan Herald]]'': "Started off well, never even half done, this ''Silence'' fades into oblivion, silently. "<ref>[http://www.deccanherald.com/content/374459/a-silent-killer-enthusiasm.html "A silent killer of enthusiasm"]</ref> Ajin Krishna of [[Oneindia.in]] rated the film 2/5 and said, "''Silence'' fails to impress the viewers as a thriller flick, which is the basic purpose of such movies.<ref>[http://entertainment.oneindia.in/malayalam/reviews/2013/silence-movie-review-126631.html "Silence Movie Review - Fails To Impress As A Thriller!"].</ref> Paresh C Palicha of [[Rediff.com]] rated the film 2.5/5 and said, "Silence is the first attempt at serious film making from the writer-director team of Y V Rajesh and V K Prakash after low-brow comedies such as ''Gulumaal'' and ''Three Kings''. It is notches above the previous attempts and highly watchable." However the reviewer felt that the film "borrows heavily from the Richard Gere starrer, ''[[Primal Fear]]'' (1996)."<ref>[http://www.rediff.com/movies/review/review-mammoottys-silence-is-worth-a-watch-south/20131209.htm "Review: Mammootty's Silence is worth a watch"]</ref>
