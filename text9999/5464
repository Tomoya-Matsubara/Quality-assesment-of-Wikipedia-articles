Constenla alleges that she was told by an unidentified astrologer that his mother, Celia de la Serna, was already pregnant when she and Ernesto Guevara Lynch were married and that the date on the birth certificate of their son was forged to make it appear that he was born a month later than the actual date to avoid scandal.

Since his death, his stylized visage has become a ubiquitous [[counterculture|countercultural]] symbol and global insignia [[Che Guevara in popular culture|within popular culture]].<ref>[[#refCasey2009|Casey 2009]], p. 128.</ref>

As a young [[medical student]], Guevara traveled throughout [[Latin America]] and was transformed by the endemic [[poverty]] he witnessed.<ref name="RevMedicine">[http://www.marxists.org/archive/guevara/1960/08/19.htm On Revolutionary Medicine] Speech by Che Guevara to the Cuban Militia on August 19, 1960.</ref> His experiences and observations during these trips led him to conclude that the region's ingrained [[Economic inequality|economic inequalities]] were an intrinsic result of [[state monopoly capitalism|monopoly capitalism]], [[neocolonialism]], and [[imperialism]], with the only remedy being [[world revolution]].<ref name="AfroAsian1965">[http://www.marxists.org/archive/guevara/1965/02/24.htm At the Afro-Asian Conference in Algeria] A speech by Che Guevara to the Second Economic Seminar of Afro-Asian Solidarity in Algiers, Algeria on February 24, 1965.</ref> This belief prompted his involvement in [[Guatemala]]'s social reforms under President [[Jacobo Arbenz Guzm<U+00E1>n]], whose eventual [[1954 Guatemalan coup d'<U+00E9>tat|CIA-assisted overthrow]] solidified Guevara's radical ideology. Later, while living in [[Mexico City]], he met [[Ra<U+00FA>l Castro|Ra<U+00FA>l]] and [[Fidel Castro]], joined their [[26th of July Movement]], and invaded Cuba aboard the yacht, ''[[Granma (yacht)|Granma]]'', with the intention of overthrowing [[United States|U.S.]]-backed Cuban [[dictator]] [[Fulgencio Batista]].<ref>[[#refBeaubien2009|Beaubien, NPR Audio Report, 2009]], 00:09-00:13.</ref> Guevara soon rose to prominence among the [[Insurgency|insurgents]], was promoted to second-in-command, and played a pivotal role in the successful two year guerrilla campaign that deposed the Batista regime.<ref name="Castrosbrain1960">''"[[#refCastrosbrain1960|Castro's Brain]]"'' 1960.</ref>

==Early life==

Ernesto Guevara was born to Celia de la Serna y Llosa and Ernesto Guevara [[Lynch (surname)|Lynch]] on <!-- Note: Please do not change birth date without discussing on talk page first. -->June 14, 1928<ref name=birthdate/> in [[Rosario]], [[Argentina]], the eldest of five children in a [[white Argentine]] family of [[Spanish Argentine|Spanish]], [[Basque Argentine|Basque]] and [[Irish Argentine|Irish]] descent.<ref>Che's last name ''"Guevara"'' derives from the [[Castilian Spanish|Castilianized]] form of the [[Basque language|Basque]] ''"[[Guevara, Spain|Gebara]]"'', a [[habitational name]] from the province of [[<U+00C1>lava]]. Through his grandmother, Ana Lynch, he was a descendant of [[Patrick Lynch (Argentina)|Patrick Lynch]], an emigrant from [[Galway]], [[Ireland]] in the 1740s.</ref> In lieu of his parents' surnames, his legal name (Ernesto Guevara) will sometimes appear with de la Serna, or Lynch accompanying it. In reference to Che's "restless" nature, his father declared "the first thing to note is that in my son's veins flowed the blood of the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|Irish rebels]]."<ref>[[#refLavretsky1976|Lavretsky 1976]].</ref> Very early on in life Ernestito (as he was then called) developed an "affinity for the poor."<ref>[[#refKellner1989|Kellner 1989]], p. 23.</ref> Growing up in a family with [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] leanings, Guevara was introduced to a wide spectrum of political perspectives even as a boy.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,872604,00.html Argentina: Che's Red Mother] ''[[Time Magazine]]'', July 14, 1961.</ref> His father, a staunch supporter of [[Second Spanish Republic|Republicans]] from the [[Spanish Civil War]], often hosted many veterans from the conflict in the Guevara home.<ref>[[#refAnderson1997|Anderson 1997]], pp. 22-23.</ref>

Though suffering crippling bouts of acute [[asthma]] that were to afflict him throughout his life, he excelled as an athlete, enjoying swimming, soccer, golf, and shooting; while also becoming an "untiring" cyclist.<ref>[[#refSandison1996|Sandison 1996]], p. 8.</ref><ref>[[#refKellner1989|Kellner 1989]], p. 24.</ref> He was an avid [[rugby union]] player, and played at [[Rugby union positions#10._Fly-half|fly-half]] for the [[University of Buenos Aires]] First XV.<ref>Cain, Nick & Growden, Greg "Chapter 21: Ten Peculiar Facts about Rugby" in ''Rugby Union for Dummies'' (2nd Edition), John Wiley and Sons, ISBN 139780470035375, p. 293.</ref> His rugby playing earned him the nickname "Fuser"<U+2014>a contraction of ''El Furibundo'' (raging) and his mother's surname, de la Serna<U+2014>for his aggressive style of play.<ref>[[#refAnderson1997|Anderson 1997]], p. 28.</ref> His schoolmates also nicknamed him ''"Chancho"'' ("pig"), because he rarely bathed, and proudly wore a "weekly shirt." 

Guevara learned [[chess]] from his father and began participating in local tournaments by age 12. During adolescence and throughout his life he was passionate about poetry, especially that of [[Pablo Neruda]], [[John Keats]], [[Antonio Machado]], [[Federico Garc<U+00ED>a Lorca]], [[Gabriela Mistral]], [[C<U+00E9>sar Vallejo]], and [[Walt Whitman]].<ref name="Hart 2004, pg 98">[[#refHart2004|Hart 2004]], p. 98.</ref> He could also recite [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s ''"[[If<U+2014>]]"'' and [[Jos<U+00E9> Hern<U+00E1>ndez (writer)|Jos<U+00E9> Hern<U+00E1>ndez]]'s ''"[[Mart<U+00ED>n Fierro]]"'' from memory.<ref name="Hart 2004, pg 98"/> The Guevara home contained more than 3,000 books, which allowed Guevara to be an enthusiastic and eclectic reader, with interests including [[Karl Marx]], [[William Faulkner]], [[Andr<U+00E9> Gide]], [[Emilio Salgari]] and [[Jules Verne]].<ref>[[#refHaney2005|Haney 2005]], p. 164.</ref> Additionally, he enjoyed the works of [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], [[Franz Kafka]], [[Albert Camus]], [[Vladimir Lenin]], and [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]; as well as [[Anatole France]], [[Friedrich Engels]], [[H.G. Wells]], and [[Robert Frost]].<ref name="ReferenceC">([[#refAnderson1997|Anderson 1997]], pp. 37<U+2013>38).</ref>

[[File:CheG1951.jpg|right|150px|thumb|A 22-year-old Guevara in 1951]] As he grew older, he developed an interest in the Latin American writers [[Horacio Quiroga]], [[Ciro Alegr<U+00ED>a]], [[Jorge Icaza]], [[Rub<U+00E9>n Dar<U+00ED>o]], and [[Miguel Asturias]].<ref name="ReferenceC"/> Many of these authors' ideas he cataloged in his own handwritten notebooks of concepts, definitions, and philosophies of influential intellectuals. These included composing analytical sketches of [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] and [[Aristotle]], along with examining [[Bertrand Russell]] on love and patriotism, [[Jack London]] on society, and [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]] on the idea of death. [[Sigmund Freud]]'s ideas fascinated him as he quoted him on a variety of topics from [[Dream interpretation|dreams]] and [[libido]] to [[narcissism]] and the [[oedipus complex]].<ref name="ReferenceC"/> His favorite subjects in school included [[philosophy]], [[mathematics]], [[engineering]], [[political science]], [[sociology]], [[history]] and [[archaeology]].<ref>[[#refSandison1996|Sandison 1996]], p. 10.</ref><ref>[[#refKellner1989|Kellner 1989]], p. 26.</ref>

Years later, a February 13, 1958, declassified CIA 'biographical and personality report' would make note of Guevara<U+2019>s wide range of academic interests and intellect, describing him as "quite well read" while adding that "Che is fairly intellectual for a Latino."<ref>[[#refRatner1997|Ratner 1997]], p. 25.</ref>

===Motorcycle journey===
{{Main|The Motorcycle Diaries|The Motorcycle Diaries (film)}}

In 1948, Guevara entered the [[University of Buenos Aires]] to study medicine. However, his "hunger to explore the world"<ref>[[#refAnderson1997|Anderson 1997]], p. 64.</ref> led him to intersperse his collegiate pursuits with two long introspective journeys that would fundamentally change the way he viewed himself and the present economic conditions in Latin America. The first expedition in 1950 was a 4,500 kilometer (2,800&nbsp;mi) solo trip through the rural provinces of [[Argentine Northwest|northern Argentina]] on a bicycle on which he installed a small motor.<ref>[[#refAnderson1997|Anderson 1997]], p. 59-64.</ref> This was followed in 1951 by a nine month 8,000 kilometer (5,000&nbsp;mi) continental motorcycle trek through most of [[South America]]. For the latter, he took a year off from studies to embark with his friend [[Alberto Granado]], with the final goal of spending a few weeks volunteering at the San Pablo [[Leper colony]] in [[Peru]], on the banks of the [[Amazon River]]. 

[[File:CheOnRaft1952.jpg|thumb|right|210px|Guevara (right) with [[Alberto Granado]] (left) aboard their "Mambo-Tango" wooden raft on the [[Amazon River]] in June of 1952. The raft was a gift from the [[lepers]] whom they had treated.<ref>[[#refAnderson1997|Anderson 1997]], p. 89.</ref>]] 

On the way to [[Machu Picchu]] high in the [[Andes]], he was struck by the crushing poverty of the remote rural areas, where peasant farmers worked small plots of land owned by wealthy landlords.<ref name="Kellner89pg27">[[#refKellner1989|Kellner 1989]], p. 27.</ref> Later on his journey, Guevara was especially impressed by the camaraderie among those living in a Leper Colony, stating "The highest forms of human solidarity and loyalty arise among such lonely and desperate people."<ref name="Kellner89pg27" /> Guevara used notes taken during this trip to write an account entitled ''[[The Motorcycle Diaries]]'', which later became a ''New York Times'' best-seller,<ref>NYT bestseller list: [http://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/20/books/bestseller/0220bestpapernonfiction.html #38 Paperback Nonfiction on 2005-02-20], [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D03E5D6123DF934A35752C1A9629C8B63&scp=5&sq=motorcycle+diaries+Ernesto+%28Che%29+Guevara&st=nyt #9 Nonfiction on 2004-10-07] and on more occasions.</ref> and was adapted into a 2004 [[The Motorcycle Diaries (film)#Awards|award-winning]] film of the [[The Motorcycle Diaries (film)|same name]].

In total, the journey took Guevara through [[Argentina]], [[Chile]], [[Peru]], [[Ecuador]], [[Colombia]], [[Venezuela]], [[Panama]], and to [[Miami]], before returning home to [[Buenos Aires]]. By trip's end, he came to view Latin America not as collection of separate nations, but as a single entity requiring a continent-wide liberation strategy. His conception of a borderless, united [[Hispanic America]] sharing a common '[[Latino]]' heritage was a theme that prominently recurred during his later revolutionary activities. Upon returning to Argentina, he completed his studies and received his medical degree in June 1953, making him officially "Dr. Ernesto Guevara."<ref>[[#refAnderson1997|Anderson 1997]], p. 98.</ref><ref>A copy of Guevara's University transcripts showing conferral of his medical diploma can be found on p. 75 of ''Becoming Che: Guevara's Second and Final Trip through Latin America'', by Carlos 'Calica' Ferrer (Translated from the Spanish by Sarah L. Smith), Marea Editorial, 2006, ISBN 987-1307-07-1. Ferrer was a longtime childhood friend of Che, and when Guevara passed the last of his 12 exams in 1953, he gave him a copy to prove to Ferrer, who had been telling Guevara that he would never finish, that he had finally completed his studies.</ref> Guevara later remarked that through his travels of Latin America, he came in "close contact with [[poverty]], [[hunger]] and [[disease]]" along with the "inability to treat a child because of lack of money" and "stupefaction provoked by the continual hunger and punishment" that leads a father to "accept the loss of a son as an unimportant accident." It was these experiences which Guevara cites as convincing him that in order to "help these people", he needed to leave the realm of medicine, and consider the political arena of armed struggle.<ref name="RevMedicine" />

==Guatemala, Arbenz and United Fruit==
{{Main|1954 Guatemalan coup d'<U+00E9>tat}}

[[File:Che Guevara - 2do Viaje - 1953-55.png|thumb|170px|Che Guevara's movements between 1953 and 1956, including his trip north to Guatemala, his stay in Mexico and his journey east by boat to Cuba with [[Fidel Castro]] and other revolutionaries]]

On July 7, 1953, Guevara set out again, this time to [[Bolivia]], [[Peru]], [[Ecuador]], [[Panama]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Honduras]] and [[El Salvador]]. On December 10, 1953, before leaving for Guatemala, Guevara sent an update to his Aunt Beatriz from [[San Jos<U+00E9>, Costa Rica]]. In the letter Guevara speaks of traversing through the "dominions" of the [[United Fruit Company]], which convinced him "how terrible" the "[[Capitalist]] octopuses" were.<ref>[[#refAnderson1997|Anderson 1997]], p. 126.</ref> This affirmed indignation carried the "head hunting tone" that he adopted in order to frighten his more [[Conservatism|Conservative]] relatives, and ends with Guevara swearing on an image of the then recently deceased [[Joseph Stalin]], not to rest until these "octopuses have been vanquished."<ref>[[#refTaibo1999|Taibo 1999]], p. 31.</ref> Later that month, Guevara arrived in [[Guatemala]] where President [[Jacobo Arbenz Guzm<U+00E1>n]] headed a democratically elected government that, through [[land reform]] and other initiatives, was attempting to end the ''[[latifundia]]'' system. To accomplish this, President Arbenz had enacted a major land reform program, where all uncultivated portions of large land holdings were to be expropriated and redistributed to landless peasants. The biggest land owner, and one most affected by the reforms, was the [[United Fruit Company]], from which the Arbenz government had already taken more than 225,000 uncultivated acres.<ref>[[#refKellner1989|Kellner 1989]], p. 31.</ref> Pleased with the road the nation was heading down, Guevara decided to settle down in Guatemala so as to "perfect himself and accomplish whatever may be necessary in order to become a true revolutionary."<ref name="Kellner89pg31">[[#refGuevaraLynch2000|Guevara Lynch 2000]], p. 26.</ref>

In [[Guatemala City]], Guevara sought out [[Hilda Gadea|Hilda Gadea Acosta]], a [[Peru]]vian [[economist]] who was well-connected politically as a member of the left-leaning [[Alianza Popular Revolucionaria Americana]] (APRA, American Popular Revolutionary Alliance). She introduced Guevara to a number of high-level officials in the [[Jacobo Arbenz Guzm<U+00E1>n#Presidency and coup|Arbenz government]]. Guevara then established contact with a group of Cuban exiles linked to [[Fidel Castro]] through the July 26, 1953 [[Moncada Barracks#Attack on Moncada Barracks|attack]] on the [[Moncada Barracks]] in [[Santiago de Cuba]].<ref>[[#refRadioCadena2006|Radio Cadena Agramonte 2006]].</ref> During this period he acquired his famous nickname, due to his frequent use of the Argentine [[vocative]] interjection ''[[Che (Spanish)|che]]'', a slang casual speech filler used similarly to "hey" (as in "hey, could you hand me a towel" and not as a form of salute.)<ref>[[#refIgnacio2007|Ignacio 2007]], p. 172.</ref>

Guevara's attempts to obtain a medical internship were unsuccessful and his economic situation was often precarious.<!--<ref name=precarious>Anderson 1997, pp. 139<U+2013>141.</ref>--> On May 15, 1954, a shipment of [[<U+0160>koda Works|<U+0160>koda]] infantry and light artillery weapons was sent from [[Czechoslovakia#Communist Czechoslovakia|Communist Czechoslovakia]] for the Arbenz Government and arrived in [[Puerto Barrios]].<ref name=usdepstate>[[#refUSDeptState2008|U.S. Department of State 2008]].</ref><ref>[[#refAnderson1997|Anderson 1997]], p. 144.</ref> As a result, the U.S. CIA sponsored an army which invaded the country and installed the [[right-wing]] dictatorship of [[Carlos Castillo Armas]].<ref name="Kellner89pg31" /> Guevara was eager to fight on behalf of Arbenz and joined an armed [[militia]] organized by the Communist Youth for that purpose, but frustrated with the group's inaction, he soon returned to medical duties. Following the coup, he again volunteered to fight, but soon after, Arbenz took refuge in the Mexican Embassy and told his foreign supporters to leave the country. Guevara<U+2019>s repeated calls to resist were noted by supporters of the coup, and he was marked for murder.<ref name="Kellner89pg32">[[#refKellner1989|Kellner 1989]], p. 32.</ref> After Hilda Gadea was arrested, Guevara sought protection inside the [[Diplomatic missions of Argentina|Argentine consulate]], where he remained until he received a safe-conduct pass some weeks later and made his way to Mexico.<ref>[[#refTaibo1999|Taibo 1999]], p. 39.</ref> He married Gadea in Mexico in September 1955.<ref name="Memoira">Snow, Anita.

Retrieved on February 23, 2009.</ref>

The overthrow of the Arbenz regime cemented Guevara's view of the United States as an [[Imperialism|imperialist]] power that would oppose and attempt to destroy any government that sought to redress the socioeconomic inequality endemic to Latin America and other developing countries. In speaking about the coup Guevara stated:
{{quote|"The last Latin American revolutionary democracy <U+2013> that of Jacobo Arbenz <U+2013> failed as a result of the cold premeditated aggression carried out by the U.S.A. Its visible head was the Secretary of State [[John Foster Dulles]], a man who, through a rare coincidence, was also a stockholder and attorney for the [[United Fruit Company]]."<ref name="Kellner89pg32"/>|}}

Guevara's conviction that Marxism achieved through armed struggle and defended by an armed populace was the only way to rectify such conditions was thus strengthened.<ref>[http://www.fsmitha.com/h2/ch24x.html Che Guevara 1960<U+2013>67 by Frank E. Smitha].</ref> Gadea wrote later, "It was Guatemala which finally convinced him of the necessity for armed struggle and for taking the initiative against imperialism. By the time he left, he was sure of this."<ref>{{cite book |title=Che Guevara |first=Andrew |last=Sinclair |publisher=The Viking Press |year=1970 |page=12}}</ref>

==Mexico City and preparation==
[[File:Hilda Gadea y Che Guevara - Luna de miel - Yucat<U+00E1>n 1955.jpg|thumb|Guevara with [[Hilda Gadea]] at [[Chich<U+00E9>n Itz<U+00E1>]] on their honeymoon trip]]
Guevara arrived in [[Mexico City]] in early September 1954, and worked in the allergy section of the General Hospital. In addition he gave lectures on medicine at the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]] and worked as a news photographer for Latina News Agency.<ref>[[#refKellner1989|Kellner 1989]], p. 33.</ref> His first wife Hilda notes in her memoir ''My Life with Che'', that for a while, Guevara considered going to work as a doctor in [[Africa]] and that he continued to be deeply troubled by the poverty around him.<ref name="RebelWife">[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/09/AR2008100902413.html Rebel Wife, A Review of ''My Life With Che: The Making of a Revolutionary'' by Hilda Gadea] by Tom Gjelten, ''[[The Washington Post]]'', October 12, 2008.</ref> In one instance, Hilda describes Guevara's obsession with an elderly washerwoman whom he was treating, remarking that he saw her as "representative of the most forgotten and exploited class." Hilda later found a poem that Che had dedicated to the old woman, containing "a promise to fight for a better world, for a better life for all the poor and exploited."<ref name="RebelWife" />

During this time he renewed his friendship with <U+00D1>ico L<U+00F3>pez and the other Cuban exiles whom he had met in Guatemala. In June 1955, L<U+00F3>pez introduced him to [[Ra<U+00FA>l Castro]] who subsequently introduced him to his older brother, [[Fidel Castro]], the revolutionary leader who had formed the [[26th of July Movement]] and was now plotting to overthrow the dictatorship of [[Fulgencio Batista]]. During a long conversation with Fidel on the night of their first meeting, Guevara concluded that the Cuban's cause was the one for which he had been searching and before daybreak he had signed up as a member of the [[July 26 Movement]].<ref>[[#refTaibo1999|Taibo 1999]], p. 55.</ref> Despite their "contrasting personalities", from this point on Che and Fidel began to foster what dual biographer Simon Reid-Henry deems a "revolutionary friendship that would change the world", as a result of their coinciding commitment to [[anti-imperialism]].<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/interactive/2009/jan/09/fidel-castro-che-guevara-biography ''Fidel and Che: A Revolutionary Friendship'' by Simon Reid-Henry] audio slideshow by ''[[The Guardian]]'', January 9, 2009</ref>

By this point in Guevara<U+2019>s life, he deemed that U.S.-controlled [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerates]] installed and supported repressive regimes around the world. In this vein, he considered Batista a "[[Puppet state|U.S. puppet]] whose strings needed cutting."<ref>[[#refSandison1996|Sandison 1996]], p. 28.</ref> Although he planned to be the group's [[combat medic]], Guevara participated in the military training with the members of the Movement. The key portion of training involved learning hit and run tactics of [[guerrilla warfare]]. Guevara and the others underwent arduous 15-hour marches over mountains, across rivers, and through the dense undergrowth, learning and perfecting the procedures of ambush and quick retreat. From the start Guevara was [[Alberto Bayo|Alberto Bayo's]] "prize student" among those in training, scoring the highest on all of the tests given.<ref>[[#refKellner1989|Kellner 1989]], p. 37.</ref> At the end of the course, he was called "the best guerrilla of them all" by their instructor, Colonel Bayo.<ref>[[#refAnderson1997|Anderson 1997]], p. 194.</ref>

==Cuban Revolution==
{{Main|Cuban Revolution|Battle of Santa Clara|Foco}}

===Invasion, warfare and Santa Clara===
[[File:CheMuleFull.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Guevara atop a mule in [[Santa Clara Province|Las Villas province]], Cuba, November 1958]]

The first step in Castro's revolutionary plan was an assault on [[Cuba]] from Mexico via the ''[[Granma (yacht)|Granma]],'' an old, leaky [[cabin cruiser]]. They set out for Cuba on November 25, 1956. Attacked by Batista's military soon after landing, many of the 82 men were either killed in the attack or executed upon capture; only 22 found each other afterwards.<ref>[[#refAnderson1997|Anderson 1997]], p. 213.</ref> Guevara wrote that it was during this bloody confrontation that he laid down his medical supplies and picked up a box of ammunition dropped by a fleeing comrade, finalizing his symbolic transition from physician to combatant.

Only a small band of revolutionaries survived to re-group as a bedraggled fighting force deep in the [[Sierra Maestra]] mountains, where they received support from the [[Urban guerrilla warfare|urban guerrilla]] network of [[Frank Pa<U+00ED>s]], the 26th of July Movement, and local campesinos. With the group withdrawn to the Sierra, the world wondered whether Castro was alive or dead until early 1957 when the interview by [[Herbert Matthews]] appeared in ''[[The New York Times]]''. The article presented a lasting, almost mythical image for Castro and the guerrillas. Guevara was not present for the interview, but in the coming months he began to realize the importance of the media in their struggle. Meanwhile, as supplies and morale diminished, and with an allergy to mosquito bites which resulted in agonizing walnut-sized cysts on his body,<ref>[[#refSandison1996|Sandison 1996]], p. 32.</ref> Guevara considered these "the most painful days of the war."<ref>[[#refDePalma2006|DePalma 2006]], pp. 110<U+2013>111.</ref>

As the war continued, Guevara became an integral part of the rebel army and "convinced Castro with competence, diplomacy and patience."<ref name="Castrosbrain1960"/> Guevara set up factories to make grenades, built ovens to bake bread, taught new recruits about tactics, and organized schools to teach illiterate campesinos to read and write.<ref name="Castrosbrain1960"/> Moreover, Guevara established health clinics, workshops to teach military tactics, and a newspaper to disseminate information.<ref>[[#refKellner1989|Kellner 1989]], p. 45.</ref> The man who three years later would be dubbed by ''[[Time Magazine]]'': "Castro's brain", at this point was promoted by [[Fidel Castro]] to ''Comandante'' (commander) of a second army column.<ref name="Castrosbrain1960"/>

As the only other ranked Comandante besides Fidel Castro, Guevara was an extremely harsh disciplinarian who unhesitatingly shot defectors. Deserters were punished as traitors, and Guevara was known to send execution squads to hunt down those seeking to go [[AWOL]].<ref>[[#refAnderson1997|Anderson 1997]], pp. 269<U+2013>270.</ref> As a result, Guevara became feared for his brutality and ruthlessness.<ref>[[#refCastaneda1998|Casta<U+00F1>eda 1998]], pp. 105, 119.</ref> During the guerrilla campaign, Guevara was also responsible for the often [[summary execution]] of a number of men accused of being [[Informant|informers]], [[Desertion|deserters]] or [[Espionage|spies]].<ref name="execution-squads">[[#refAnderson1997|Anderson 1997]], pp. 237-238, 269<U+2013>270, 277<U+2013>278.</ref> 

In his diaries, Guevara described the first such execution of [[Eutimio Guerra]], a peasant army guide who admitted treason when it was discovered he accepted the promise of ten thousand pesos for repeatedly giving away the rebel's position for attack by the Cuban air force.<ref name="Lutherpg97-99">[[#refLuther2001|Luther 2001]], pp. 97-99.</ref> Such information also allowed Batista's army to burn the homes of rebel-friendly peasants.<ref name="Lutherpg97-99"/> Upon Guerra's request that they "end his life quickly",<ref name="Lutherpg97-99"/> Che stepped forward and shot him in the head, writing "The situation was uncomfortable for the people and for Eutimio so I ended the problem giving him a shot with a .32 pistol in the right side of the brain, with exit orifice in the right temporal [lobe]."<ref name="Andersonpg237">[[#refAnderson1997|Anderson 1997]], 237.</ref> His scientific notations and matter-of-fact description, suggested to one biographer a "remarkable detachment to violence" by that point in the war.<ref name="Andersonpg237"/> Later, Guevara published a literary account of the incident entitled "Death of a Traitor", where he transfigured Eutimio's betrayal and pre-execution request that the revolution "take care of his children", into a "revolutionary [[parable]] about redemption through sacrifice."<ref name="Andersonpg237"/>

Although he maintained a demanding and harsh disposition, Guevara also viewed his role of commander as one of a teacher, entertaining his men during breaks between engagements with readings from the likes of [[Robert Louis Stevenson]], [[Cervantes]], and Spanish [[lyric poetry|lyric poets]].<ref>[[#refSandison1996|Sandison 1996]], p. 35.</ref> His commanding officer [[Fidel Castro]] has described Guevara as intelligent, daring, and an exemplary leader who "had great moral authority over his troops."<ref>[[#refIgnacio2007|Ignacio 2007]], p. 177.</ref> Castro has further remarked that Guevara took too many risks, even having a "tendency toward foolhardiness."<ref>[[#refIgnacio2007|Ignacio 2007]], p. 193.</ref> Guevara's teenage lieutenant, Joel Iglesias, recounts such actions in his diary, noting that Guevara's behavior in combat even brought admiration from the enemy. On one occasion Iglesias recounts the time he had been wounded in battle, stating "Che ran out to me, defying the bullets, threw me over his shoulder, and got me out of there. The guards didn't dare fire at him ... later they told me he made a great impression on them when they saw him run out with his pistol stuck in his belt, ignoring the danger, they didn't dare shoot."<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/books/reviews/companero.htm Poster Boy of The Revolution] by [[Saul Landau]], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', October 19, 1997, p. X01.</ref>

Guevara was instrumental in creating the [[Pirate radio|clandestine radio station]] ''[[Radio Rebelde]]'' in February 1958, which broadcast news to the Cuban people with statements by the 26th of July movement, and provided [[radiotelephone]] communication between the growing number of rebel columns across the island. Guevara had apparently been inspired to create the station by observing the effectiveness of [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] supplied radio in Guatemala in ousting the government of [[Jacobo Arbenz Guzm<U+00E1>n]].<ref name="radio">{{cite web |url=http://www.pateplumaradio.com/central/cuba/rebel1.html |title=Revolution! Clandestine Radio and the Rise of Fidel Castro |first=Don |last=Moore |publisher=Patepluma Radio}}</ref>

In late July 1958, Guevara played a critical role in the [[Battle of Las Mercedes]] by using his column to halt a force of 1,500 men called up by Batista's General Cantillo in a plan to encircle and destroy Castro's forces. Years later, [[Major (United States)|Major]] Larry Bockman of the [[United States Marine Corps]] would analyze and describe Che's tactical appreciation of this battle as "brilliant."<ref>[[#refBockman1984|Bockman 1984]].</ref> During this time Guevara also became an "expert" at leading hit and run tactics against Batista<U+2019>s army, and then fading back into the countryside before the army could counterattack.<ref>[[#refKellner1989|Kellner 1989]], p. 40.</ref>

As the war extended, Guevara led a new column of fighters dispatched westward for the final push towards [[Havana]]. Travelling by foot, Guevara embarked on a difficult 7 week march only travelling at night to avoid ambush, and often not eating for several days.<ref name="Kellner1989pg47">[[#refKellner1989|Kellner 1989]], p. 47.</ref> In the closing days of December 1958, Guevara<U+2019>s task was to cut the island in half by taking [[Las Villas]] province. In a matter of days he executed a series of "brilliant tactical victories" that gave him control of all but the province<U+2019>s capital city of [[Santa Clara, Cuba|Santa Clara]].<ref name="Kellner1989pg47" /> Guevara then directed his "suicide squad" in the [[Battle of Santa Clara|attack on Santa Clara]], that became the final decisive military victory of the revolution.<ref>[[#refCastro1972|Castro 1972]], pp. 439<U+2013>442.</ref><ref>[[#refDorschner1980|Dorschner 1980]], pp. 41<U+2013>47, 81<U+2013>87.</ref> In the six weeks leading up to the [[Battle of Santa Clara]] there were times when his men were completely surrounded, outgunned, and overrun. Che's eventual victory despite being outnumbered 10:1, remains in the view of some observers a "remarkable tour de force in modern warfare."<ref>[[#refSandison1996|Sandison 1996]], p. 39.</ref> 

[[File:Che SClara.jpg|thumb|150px|left|After the [[battle of Santa Clara]], January 1, 1959]]

Radio Rebelde broadcast the first reports that Guevara's column had [[Battle of Santa Clara|taken Santa Clara]] on New Year's Eve 1958. This contradicted reports by the heavily controlled national news media, which had at one stage reported Guevara's death during the fighting. At 3 am on January 1, 1959, upon learning that his generals were negotiating a separate peace with Guevara, [[Fulgencio Batista]] boarded a plane in Havana and fled for the [[Dominican Republic]], along with an amassed "fortune of more than $ 300,000,000 through graft and payoffs."<ref>[[#refKellner1989|Kellner 1989]], p. 48.</ref> The following day on January 2, Guevara entered [[Havana]] to take final control of the capitol.<ref>[[#refKellner1989|Kellner 1989]], p. 13.</ref> Fidel Castro however took 6 more days to arrive, as he stopped to rally support in several large cities on his way to rolling victoriously into Havana on January 8, 1959. In mid-January 1959, Guevara went to live at a summer villa in [[Tarara]] to recover from a violent asthma attack.<ref>Castaneda, pp. 145-146.</ref> While there he started the Tarara Group, a group that debated and formed the new plans for Cuba's social, political, and economic development.<ref name="Castaneda, p. 146">Castaneda, p. 146.</ref> In addition, Che began to write his book ''[[Guerrilla Warfare (book)|Guerrilla Warfare]]'' while resting at [[Tarara]].<ref name="Castaneda, p. 146"/>

In February, the revolutionary government proclaimed Guevara "a Cuban citizen by birth" in recognition of his role in the triumph.<ref>[[#refAnderson1997|Anderson 1997]], 397.</ref> When [[Hilda Gadea]] arrived in Cuba in late January, Guevara told her that he was involved with another woman, and the two agreed on a divorce,<ref>[[#refAnderson1997|Anderson 1997]], pp. 400<U+2013>401.</ref> which was finalized on May 22.<ref>[[#refAnderson1997|Anderson 1997]], p. 424.</ref> On June 2, 1959, he married [[Aleida March]], a Cuban-born member of the 26th of July movement with whom he had been living since late 1958.

===La Caba<U+00F1>a, land reform, and literacy===
During the rebellion against Batista's dictatorship, the general command of the rebel army, led by Fidel Castro, introduced into the liberated territories the 19th century penal law commonly known as the ''Ley de la Sierra''.<ref>[[#refTreto1991|G<U+00F3>mez Treto 1991]], p. 115. "The Penal Law of the War of Independence (July 28, 1896) was reinforced by Rule 1 of the Penal Regulations of the Rebel Army, approved in the Sierra Maestra February 21, 1958, and published in the army's official bulletin (Ley penal de Cuba en armas, 1959)" ([[#refTreto1991|G<U+00F3>mez Treto 1991]], p. 123).</ref> This law included the death penalty for extremely serious crimes, whether perpetrated by the dictatorship or by supporters of the revolution. In 1959, the revolutionary government extended its application to the whole of the republic and to those it considered war criminals, captured and tried after the revolution. According to the Cuban Ministry of Justice, this latter extension was supported by the majority of the population, and followed the same procedure as those in the [[Nuremberg Trials]] held by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] after World War II.<ref>[[#refTreto1991|G<U+00F3>mez Treto 1991]], pp. 115<U+2013>116).</ref>

To implement a portion of this plan, Castro named Guevara commander of the [[La Caba<U+00F1>a Fortress]] prison, for a five-month tenure (January 2 through June 12, 1959).<ref>[[#refAnderson1997|Anderson 1997]], pp. 372, 425.</ref> Guevara was charged with purging the Batista army and consolidating victory by exacting "revolutionary justice" against those considered to be traitors, ''chivatos'' (informants) or [[war criminals]].<ref>[[#refAnderson1997|Anderson 1997]], p. 376.</ref> Serving in the post as commander of La Caba<U+00F1>a, Guevara reviewed the appeals of those convicted during the revolutionary tribunal process.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> On some occasions the penalty delivered by the tribunal was death by [[firing squad]].<ref>[[#refNiess2007|Niess 2007]], p. 60.</ref> Ra<U+00FA>l G<U+00F3>mez Treto, senior legal advisor to the Cuban Ministry of Justice, has argued that the death penalty was justified in order to prevent citizens themselves from taking justice into their own hands, as happened twenty years earlier in the anti-[[Gerardo Machado|Machado]] rebellion.<ref>[[#refTreto1991|G<U+00F3>mez Treto 1991]], p. 116).</ref> Biographers note that in January 1959, the Cuban public was in a "lynching mood",<ref>[[#refAnderson1997|Anderson 1997]], p. 388.</ref> and point to a survey at the time showing 93% public approval for the tribunal process.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> With 20,000 Cubans estimated to have been killed at the hands of Batista's collaborators,<ref>[[#refNiess2007|Niess 2007]], p. 61.</ref> and many of the war criminals sentenced to death accused of [[torture]] and physical atrocities,<ref name="ReferenceA"/> the newly empowered government carried out executions which biographer [[Jorge Casta<U+00F1>eda Gutman|Jorge Casta<U+00F1>eda]] describes as "without respect for [[due process]]."<ref name="Casta<U+00F1>eda 1998 p 143-144" /> Although the exact numbers differ, it is estimated that several hundred people were executed nationwide during this time, with Guevara's jurisdictional death total at La Caba<U+00F1>a ranging from 55 to 164.<ref>Different sources cite differing numbers of executions, with some of the discrepancy resulting from which deaths to attribute directly to Guevara or to the regime as a whole. [[#refAnderson1997|Anderson (1997)]] gives the number specifically at La Caba<U+00F1>a prison as 55 (p. 387.), while also stating that as a whole "several hundred people were officially tried and executed across Cuba" (p. 387). ([[#refCastaneda1998|Casta<U+00F1>eda 1998]]) notes how historians differ on the number killed and place it as anywhere from 200-700 nationwide (p. 143), although he notes that "after a certain date most of the executions occurred outside of Che's jurisdiction" (p. 143). These numbers are supported by [[#refLago|Armando Lago]] and the opposition-based ''Free Society Project / Cuba Archive'', which gives the figure as 216 executions ordered by Guevara across Cuba in three years (1957-1960) and 164 "victims" specifically at La Caba<U+00F1>a, which were according to Lago, "all carried out without affording the victims due process of law."</ref>

Conflicting views exist of Guevara's delight towards the executions at La Caba<U+00F1>a. Some exiled opposition biographers report that he relished the rituals of the firing squad, and organized them with gusto, while others relate that Guevara pardoned as many prisoners as he could.<ref name="Casta<U+00F1>eda 1998 p 143-144">[[#refCastaneda1998|Casta<U+00F1>eda 1998]], pp. 143-144.</ref> What is acknowledged by all sides is that Guevara had become a "hardened" man, who had no qualms about the death penalty or summary and collective trials. If the only way to "defend the revolution was to execute its enemies, he would not be swayed by humanitarian or political arguments."<ref name="Casta<U+00F1>eda 1998 p 143-144" /> This is further confirmed by a February 5, 1959, letter to Luis Paredes L<U+00F3>pez in [[Buenos Aires]] where Guevara states unequivocally "The executions by firing squads are not only a necessity for the people of Cuba, but also an imposition of the people."<ref>[[#refAnderson1997|Anderson 1997]], p. 375.</ref> 

[[File:Manuel Urrutia2.jpg|thumb|200px|left|(right to left) Rebel leader [[Camilo Cienfuegos]], Cuban President [[Manuel Urrutia]], and Guevara (January 1959)]]

Along with ensuring "revolutionary justice", the other key early platform of Guevara's was establishing agrarian [[land reform]]. Almost immediately after the success of the revolution on January 27, 1959, Che Guevara made one of his most significant speeches where he talked about "the social ideas of the rebel army." During this speech, he declared that the main concern of the new Cuban government was "the social justice that [[land redistribution]] brings about."<ref>[[#refKellner1989|Kellner 1989]], p. 54.</ref> A few months later on May 17, 1959, the [[Agrarian Reform Laws of Cuba|Agrarian Reform Law]] called on and crafted by Che Guevara went into effect, limiting the size of all farms to 1,000 acres. Any holdings over these limits were expropriated by the government and either redistributed to peasants in 67 acre parcels or held as state run communes.<ref>[[#refKellner1989|Kellner 1989]], p. 57.</ref> The law also stipulated that sugar plantations could not be owned by foreigners.<ref name="Kellner58" />

On June 12, 1959, Castro sent Guevara out on a three-month tour of 14 countries, most of them [[Asian-African Conference|Bandung Pact]] members in Africa and Asia. Sending Guevara from Havana allowed Castro to appear to be distancing himself from Che and his [[Marxism|Marxist]] sympathies, that troubled both the United States and some of Castro's 26 July Movement members.<ref>[[#refAnderson1997|Anderson 1997]], p. 423.</ref> He spent 12 days in Japan (July 15<U+2013>27), participating in negotiations aimed at expanding Cuba's trade relations with that nation. During this visit, Guevara secretly visited the city of [[Hiroshima]], where the American military had [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|detonated]] an [[Little Boy|atom-bomb]] 14 years earlier. Guevara was "really shocked" at what he witnessed and by his visit to a hospital where A-bomb survivors were being treated.<ref>[[#refNiwata2007|Niwata 2007]]. Guevara requested that the Japanese government arrange for him to visit Hiroshima. When they refused, he covertly left his [[Osaka]] hotel to visit Hiroshima by night train, along with his aide Omar Fern<U+00E1>ndez.</ref>

Upon returning to Cuba in September 1959, it was evident that Castro now had more political power. The government had begun land seizures included in the agrarian reform law, but was hedging on compensation offers to landowners, instead offering low interest "bonds", which put the U.S. on alert. At this point the affected wealthy cattlemen of [[Camag<U+00FC>ey]] mounted a campaign against the land redistributions, and enlisted the newly disaffected rebel leader [[Huber Matos]], who along with the anti-Communist wing of the 26th of July Movement, joined them in denouncing the "Communist encroachment."<ref name="Anderson 1997 p 435">[[#refAnderson1997|Anderson 1997]], p. 435.</ref> During this time [[Dominican Republic|Dominican]] dictator [[Rafael Trujillo]] was offering assistance to the "Anti-Communist Legion of the Caribbean" who was training in the Dominican Republic. This multi-national force composed mostly of Spaniards and Cubans, but also of [[Croatia]]ns, Germans, Greeks, and right-wing mercenaries, were plotting to topple Castro's new regime.<ref name="Anderson 1997 p 435"/>

Such threats were heightened when on March 4, 1960, two massive explosions ripped through the French freighter ''[[La Coubre explosion|La Coubre]]'', which was carrying Belgian munitions from the port of [[Antwerp]], and docked in [[Havana Harbor]]. The blasts killed at least 76 people and injured several hundred, with Guevara personally providing first aid to some of the victims. Cuban leader Fidel Castro immediately accused the CIA of "an act of terrorism" and held a state funeral the following day for the victims of the blast.<ref>[[#refCasey2009|Casey 2009]], p. 25.</ref> It was at the memorial service that [[Alberto Korda]] took the famous photograph of Guevara, now known as ''[[Che Guevara (photo)|Guerrillero Heroico]]''.<ref>[[#refCasey2009|Casey 2009]], pp. 25-50.</ref>

These perceived threats prompted Castro to further eliminate "[[counter-revolutionaries]]", and utilize Guevara to now drastically increase the speed of [[land reform]]. To implement this plan, a new government agency the [[National Institute of Agrarian Reform]] (INRA) was established to administer the new Agrarian Reform law, and quickly became the most important governing body in the nation with Guevara serving as its head as minister of industries.<ref name="Kellner58">[[#refKellner1989|Kellner 1989]], p. 58.</ref> Under Guevara's command, INRA established its own 100,000 person militia, used first to help the government seize control of the expropriated land and supervise its distribution, and later to set up cooperative farms. The land confiscated included 480,000 acres owned by U.S. corporations.<ref name="Kellner58" /> Months later, as retaliation, [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|U.S President Dwight D. Eisenhower]] sharply reduced the import of Cuban sugar (Cuba<U+2019>s main cash crop), thus leading Guevara on July 10, 1960, to address over 100,000 workers in front of the [[Museum of the Revolution|Presidential Palace]] at a rally called to denounce U.S. "economic aggression."<ref name="Kellner55">[[#refKellner1989|Kellner 1989]], p. 55.</ref>

Along with land reform, one of the primary areas that Guevara stressed needed national improvement was in the area of [[literacy]]. Before 1959 the official literacy rate for Cuba was between 60-76 %, with educational access in rural areas and a lack of instructors the main determining factor.<ref name="Kellnerpg61">[[#refKellner1989|Kellner 1989]], p. 61.</ref> As a result, the Cuban government at Guevara's behest dubbed 1961 the "year of education", and sent "literacy brigades" out into the countryside to construct schools, train new educators, and teach the predominately illiterate ''Guajiros'' (peasants) to read and write. Unlike many of Guevara's later economic initiatives, this campaign was "a remarkable success."<ref name="Kellnerpg61"/> By the completion of the campaign, 707,212 adults were taught to read and write, raising the national literacy rate to 96 %.<ref name="Kellnerpg61"/>

Guevara then acquired the additional position of Finance Minister as President of the National Bank, which along with Minister of Industries, placed Che at the zenith of his power, as the "virtual czar" of the Cuban economy.<ref name="Kellner55"/> 

As a consequence of his new position, it was now Guevara's duty to sign the Cuban currency, which per custom would bear his signature. However, instead of using his more dignified full name, he dismissively signed the bills solely "''Che''."<ref name="Crompton2009">[[#refCrompton2009|Crompton 2009]], p. 71.</ref> It was through this symbolic act, which horrified many in the Cuban financial sector, that Guevara signaled his distaste for money and the class distinctions it brought about.<ref name="Crompton2009"/> Guevara's long time friend Ricardo Rojo later remarked that "the day he signed ''Che'' on the bills, (he) literally knocked the props from under the widespread belief that money was sacred."<ref>[[#refKellner1989|Kellner 1989]], p. 60.</ref>

In addition to Spanish, Guevara was fluent in French.<ref>[[#refDumur1964|Dumur 1964]] shows Che Guevara speaking French.</ref>]]

Guevara's first desired economic goal, which coincided with his aversion for wealth, was to see a nation-wide elimination of material incentives in favor of moral ones. He viewed [[capitalism]] as a "contest among wolves" where "one can only win at the cost of others," and thus desired to see the creation of a "new man and woman."<ref name="SocialismAndMan" /> Guevara continually stressed that a [[socialist]] economy in itself is not "worth the effort, sacrifice, and risks of war and destruction" if it ends up encouraging "greed and individual ambition at the expense [[collectivism|collective spirit]]."<ref name ="Kellner62">[[#refKellner1989|Kellner 1989]], p. 62.</ref> A primary goal of Guevara's thus became to reform "individual consciousness" and values to produce better workers and citizens.<ref name ="Kellner62" /> In his view, Cuba's "new man" would be able to overcome the "[[egotism]]" and "[[selfishness]]" that he loathed and discerned was uniquely characteristic of individuals in [[capitalist]] societies.<ref name ="Kellner62" /> In describing this new method of "development", Guevara stated:
{{quote|"There is a great difference between free-enterprise development and revolutionary development. In one of them, wealth is concentrated in the hands of a fortunate few, the friends of the government, the best wheeler-dealers. In the other, wealth is the people<U+2019>s patrimony."<ref>[[#refKellner1989|Kellner 1989]], p. 59.</ref>}} 

A further integral part of fostering a sense of "unity between the individual and the mass", Guevara believed, was volunteer work and will. To display this, Guevara "led by example", working "endlessly at his ministry job, in construction, and even cutting sugar cane" on his day off.<ref>[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/castro/peopleevents/p_guevara.html PBS: Che Guevara, Popular but Ineffective].</ref> He was known for working 36 hours at a stretch, calling meetings after midnight, and eating on the run.<ref name ="Kellner62" /> Such behavior was befitting of Guevara's new program of moral incentives, where each worker was now required to meet a quota and produce a certain number of goods. However, as a replacement for the pay increases abolished by Guevara, workers who now exceeded their quota only received a certificate of commendation, while workers who failed to meet their quotas were given a pay cut.<ref name ="Kellner62" /> Guevara unapologetically defended his personal philosophy towards motivation and work, stating:

{{quote|"This is not a matter of how many pounds of meat one might be able to eat, or how many times a year someone can go to the beach, or how many ornaments from abroad one might be able to buy with his current salary. What really matters is that the individual feels more complete, with much more internal richness and much more responsibility."<ref>[[#refKellner1989|Kellner 1989]], p. 75.</ref>}}

In the face of a loss of commercial connections with Western states, Guevara tried to replace them with closer commercial relationships with Eastern Bloc states, visiting a number of communist states and signing trade agreements with them. At the end of 1960 he visited Czechoslovakia, the U.S.S.R., North Korea, Hungary and East Germany and signed, for instance, a trade agreement in East Berlin on 17 December 1960.<ref>[http://209.85.129.132/search?q=cache:2Snml_GJjbwJ:handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA351284+%22Heinrich+Rau%22+Spain&cd=70&hl=en&ct=clnk]|FBIS Latin America Report 1984 p. 24 (p. 29 in linked HTML file).</ref> Such agreements helped Cuba's economy to a certain degree but had also the disadvantage of a growing economical dependency on the Eastern Bloc.

Whatever the merits or demerits of Guevara<U+2019>s economic principles, his programs soon ended in failure.<ref name="Kellner63">[[#refKellner1989|Kellner 1989]], p. 63.</ref> Guevara's program of "moral incentives" for workers caused a rapid drop in productivity and a rapid rise in absenteeism.<ref>[[#refKellner1989|Kellner 1989]], p. 74.</ref> In reference to the collective failings of Guevara's vision, reporter [[I.F. Stone]] who interviewed Che twice during this time, remarked that he was "[[Galahad]] not [[Maximilien Robespierre|Robespierre]]", while opining that "in a sense he was, like some early saint, taking refuge in the desert. Only there could the purity of the faith be safeguarded from the unregenerate revisionism of [[human nature]]."<ref>[http://www.newstatesman.com/society/2007/09/che-revolutionary-american The Spirit of Che Guevara] by [[I.F.

On April 17, 1961, 1,400 U.S. trained Cuban exiles invaded the island during the [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]]. Guevara himself did not play a key role in the fighting, as one day before the invasion a warship carrying Marines faked an invasion off the West Coast of [[Pinar Del Rio]] and drew forces commanded by Guevara to that region. However, historians give Guevara, who was director of instruction for Cuba<U+2019>s armed forces at the time, a share of credit for the victory.<ref name="Kellner89pg69" /> Author [[Tad Szulc]] in his explanation of the Cuban victory, assigns Guevara partial credit, stating: "The revolutionaries won because Che Guevara, as the head of the Instruction Department of the Revolutionary Armed Forces in charge of the militia training program, had done so well in preparing 200,000 men and women for war."<ref name="Kellner89pg69" /> It was also during this deployment where he suffered a bullet grazing to the cheek when his pistol fell out of its holster and accidentally discharged.<ref>[[#refAnderson1997|Anderson 1997]], p. 507.</ref>
[[File:Che Guevara and Kim Il-Sung, 1960.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Che Guevara with [[North Korea]]n leader [[Kim Il-Sung]] and a female translator, 1960]]
In August 1961, during an economic conference of the [[Organization of American States]] in [[Punta del Este]], [[Uruguay]], Che Guevara sent a note of "gratitude" to U.S. President [[John F. Kennedy]] through [[Richard N. Goodwin]], a young secretary of the White House. It read "Thanks for Playa Gir<U+00F3>n (Bay of Pigs). Before the invasion, the revolution was shaky. Now it's stronger than ever."<ref>[[#refAnderson1997|Anderson 1997]], p. 509.</ref> In response to U.S. [[Treasury Secretary]] [[Douglas Dillon]] presenting the [[Alliance for Progress]] for ratification by the meeting, Guevara antagonistically attacked the United States claim of being a "[[democracy]]", stating that such a system was not compatible with "financial [[oligarchy]], [[Racial segregation in the United States|discrimination against blacks]], and outrages by the [[Ku Klux Klan]]."<ref name="PuntaDelEsteChe">[http://www.marxists.org/archive/guevara/1961/08/08.htm "Economics Cannot be Separated from Politics"] speech by Che Guevara to the ministerial meeting of the Inter-American Economic and Social Council (CIES), in Punta del Este, Uruguay on August 8, 1961.</ref> Guevara continued, speaking out against the "persecution" that in his view "drove scientists like [[J. Robert Oppenheimer|Oppenheimer]] from their posts, deprived the world for years of the marvelous voice of [[Paul Robeson]], and sent [[Julius and Ethel Rosenberg|the Rosenbergs]] to their deaths against the protests of a shocked world."<ref name="PuntaDelEsteChe"/> Guevara ended his remarks by insinuating that the United States was not interested in real reforms, [[sardonically]] [[quip]]ping that "U.S. experts never talk about agrarian reform; they prefer a safe subject, like a better water supply. In short they seem to prepare the revolution of the toilets."<ref name="ReferenceC">[[#refKellner1989|Kellner 1989]], p. 78.</ref>

Guevara, who was practically the architect of the [[Cuban-Soviet relations|Soviet-Cuban relationship]],<ref>[[#refAnderson1997|Anderson 1997]], p. 492.</ref> then played a key role in bringing to Cuba the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Nuclear weapon|nuclear-armed]] [[ballistic missile]]s that precipitated the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] in October 1962 and brought the world to the brink of nuclear war.<ref>[[#refAnderson1997|Anderson 1997]], p. 530.</ref> During an interview with the British Communist newspaper The ''[[The Morning Star|Daily Worker]]'' a few weeks after the crisis, Guevara still fuming over the perceived Soviet betrayal, stated that if the missiles had been under Cuban control, they would have fired them off.<ref name="Anderson 1997 p 545">[[#refAnderson1997|Anderson 1997]], p. 545.</ref> Sam Russell, the British correspondent who spoke to Guevara at the time came away with "mixed feelings", calling him "a warm character" and "clearly a man of great intelligence", but "crackers from the way he went on about the missiles."<ref name="Anderson 1997 p 545"/> The missile crisis further convinced Guevara that the two World's superpowers (U.S. & U.S.S.R.) used Cuba as a pawn in their own global strategies. Afterward he denounced the Soviets almost as frequently as he denounced the Americans.<ref>[[#refKellner1989|Kellner 1989]], p. 73.</ref>

==International diplomacy==
By December 1964, Che Guevara had emerged as a "revolutionary statesman of world stature" and thus traveled to [[New York City]] as head of the Cuban delegation to speak at the [[United Nations]].<ref>[[#refKellner1989|Kellner 1989]], p. 60.</ref> During his impassioned address, he criticized the United Nations inability to confront the "brutal [[South Africa under apartheid|policy of apartheid]]" in [[South Africa]], proclaiming "can the United Nations do nothing to stop this?"<ref name="GuevaraUnitedNations">[http://www.marxists.org/archive/guevara/1964/12/11.htm "Colonialism is Doomed"] speech to the 19th General Assembly of the United Nations in New York City by Cuban representative Che Guevara on December 11, 1964.</ref> Guevara then denounced the [[Jim Crow laws|United States policy]] towards their black population, stating:
{{quote|"Those who kill their own children and discriminate daily against them because of the color of their skin; those who let the murderers of blacks remain free, protecting them, and furthermore punishing the black population because they demand their legitimate rights as free men <U+2014> how can those who do this consider themselves guardians of freedom?"<ref name="GuevaraUnitedNations"/>}}

An indignant Guevara ended his speech by reciting the ''Second Declaration of Havana'', decreeing Latin America a "family of 200 million brothers who suffer the same miseries."<ref name="GuevaraUnitedNations"/> This "epic", Guevara declared, would be written by the "hungry Indian masses, peasants without land, exploited workers, and progressive masses." To Guevara the conflict was a struggle of mass and ideas, which would be carried forth by those "mistreated and scorned by [[imperialism]]" who were previously considered "a weak and submissive flock." With this "flock", Guevara now asserted, "Yankee monopoly capitalism" now terrifyingly saw their "gravediggers."<ref name="GuevaraUnitedNations"/> It would be during this "hour of vindication" Guevara pronounced, that the "anonymous mass" would begin to write its own history "with its own blood", and reclaim those "rights that were laughed at by one and all for 500 years." Guevara ended his remarks to the United Nations general assembly by hypothesizing that this "wave of anger<U+201D> would "sweep the lands of Latin America", and that the labor masses who "turn the wheel of history", for the first time were "awakening from the long, brutalizing sleep to which they had been subjected.<ref name="GuevaraUnitedNations"/>

Guevara later learned that there were two failed attempts on his life by [[Cuban exiles]] during his stop at the U.N. complex.<ref name="NYTDec1964">[http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/belligerence/bazooka.htm Bazooka Fired at U.N. as Cuban Speaks] by [[Homer Bigart]], ''[[The New York Times]]'', December 12, 1964 - p. 1.</ref> The first from Molly Gonzales who tried to break through barricades upon his arrival with a seven-inch hunting knife, and later during his address by Guillermo Novo with a timer-initiated bazooka that was fired off target from a boat in the [[East River]] at the [[United Nations Headquarters]].<ref name="NYTDec1964" /><ref>[http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/JFKnovoG.htm Guillermo Novo Biography] by ''Spartacus Educational Encyclopedia''.</ref> Afterwards, Guevara commented on both incidents stating that "it is better to be killed by a woman with a knife than by a man with a gun", while adding with a languid wave of his cigar that the explosion had "given the whole thing more flavor."<ref name="NYTDec1964" />

[[File:CheinMoscow.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Walking through [[Red Square]] in [[Moscow]], November 1964 ]]

While in New York City, Guevara also appeared on the [[CBS]] Sunday news program ''[[Face the Nation]]''<ref>[[#refSnow2007|Snow 2007]].</ref> and met with a range of people, from U.S. Senator [[Eugene McCarthy]]<ref>[[#refHart2004|Hart 2004]], p. 271.</ref> to associates of [[Malcolm X]]. Malcolm X expressed his admiration, declaring Guevara "one of the most revolutionary men in this country right now" while reading a statement from him to a crowd at the [[Audubon Ballroom]].<ref>[[#refAnderson1997|Anderson 1997]], p. 618.</ref>

On December 17, Guevara left for Paris and embarked on a three-month tour that included the [[People's Republic of China]], the [[United Arab Republic]] ([[Egypt]]), [[Algeria]], [[Ghana]], [[Guinea]], [[Mali]], [[Benin|Dahomey]], [[Republic of the Congo|Congo-Brazzaville]] and [[Tanzania]], with stops in [[Ireland]] and [[Prague]]. While in Ireland, Guevara embraced his own Irish heritage, celebrating [[Saint Patrick's Day]] in [[Limerick City]].<ref>http://www.fantompowa.net/Flame/che_guevara_irish_roots.htm</ref> He wrote to his father on this visit, humorously stating "I am in this green Ireland of your ancestors. When they found out, the television [station] came to ask me about the Lynch genealogy, but in case they were horse thieves or something like that, I didn't say much."<ref>[http://www.irishecho.com/archives/archivestory.cfm?newspaperid=16187&issueid=406 St. Patrick's Day 2005: Che Lives] by Peter McDermott, ''The Irish Echo'', March 16<U+2013>22, 2005 edition.</ref>

During this voyage, he wrote a letter to Carlos Quijano, editor of a [[Uruguay]]an weekly, which was later re-titled ''Socialism and Man in Cuba''.<ref name="SocialismAndMan">[http://www.marxists.org/archive/guevara/1965/03/man-socialism.htm "Socialism and Man in Cuba"] A letter to Carlos Quijano, editor of ''Marcha'', a weekly published in Montevideo, Uruguay; published as "From Algiers, for Marcha: The Cuban Revolution Today" by Che Guevara on March 12, 1965.</ref> Outlined in the treatise was Guevara's summons for the creation of a new consciousness, status of work, and role of the individual. He also laid out the reasoning behind his [[anti-capitalist]] sentiments, stating:

{{quote|"The laws of capitalism, blind and invisible to the majority, act upon the individual without his thinking about it. He sees only the vastness of a seemingly infinite horizon before him. That is how it is painted by capitalist propagandists, who purport to draw a lesson from the example of [[John D. Rockefeller|Rockefeller]] <U+2014> whether or not it is true <U+2014> about the possibilities of success. The amount of poverty and suffering required for the emergence of [[Rockefeller family|a Rockefeller]], and the amount of depravity that the accumulation of a fortune of such magnitude entails, are left out of the picture, and it is not always possible to make the people in general see this."<ref name="SocialismAndMan" />}}

Guevara ended the essay by declaring that "the true revolutionary is guided by a great feeling of love" and beckoning on all revolutionaries to "strive every day so that this love of living humanity will be transformed into acts that serve as examples", thus becoming "a moving force."<ref name="SocialismAndMan"/> The genesis for Guevara's assertions relied on the fact that he believed the example of the Cuban Revolution was "something spiritual that would transcend all borders."<ref name="ReferenceC"/> 

In [[Algiers]] on February 24, 1965, he made what turned out to be his last public appearance on the international stage when he delivered a speech at an economic seminar on Afro-Asian solidarity.<ref>[[#refGuevara1969|Guevara 1969]], p. 350.</ref> He specified the moral duty of the socialist countries, accusing them of tacit complicity with the exploiting Western countries. He proceeded to outline a number of measures which he said the communist-bloc countries must implement in order to accomplish the defeat of imperialism.<ref>[[#refGuevara1969|Guevara 1969]], pp. 352<U+2013>59.</ref> Having criticized the Soviet Union (the primary financial backer of Cuba) in such a public manner, he returned to Cuba on March 14 to a solemn reception by Fidel and Ra<U+00FA>l Castro, Osvaldo Dortic<U+00F3>s and Carlos Rafael Rodr<U+00ED>guez at the Havana airport.

[[File:CheWithMao1.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Guevara took a pro-[[Communist Party of China|Chinese]] stance on the [[Sino-Soviet split]]. In November 1960, he was received in [[Communist China]] by Chairman [[Mao Zedong]] with an official ceremony in the Government palace.]]

Two weeks later, in 1965 Guevara dropped out of public life and then vanished altogether. His whereabouts were a great mystery in Cuba, as he was generally regarded as second in power to Castro himself. His disappearance was variously attributed to the failure of the [[industrialization]] scheme he had advocated while minister of industry, to pressure exerted on Castro by Soviet officials disapproving of Guevara's pro-[[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communist]] stance on the [[Sino-Soviet split]], and to serious differences between Guevara and the pragmatic Castro regarding Cuba's economic development and ideological line.

The coincidence of Guevara's views with those expounded by the Chinese Communist leadership was increasingly problematic for Cuba as the nation's economy became more and more dependent on the Soviet Union. Since the early days of the Cuban revolution, Guevara had been considered by many an advocate of [[Maoism|Maoist]] strategy in Latin America and the originator of a plan for the rapid industrialization of Cuba which was frequently compared to China's "[[Great Leap Forward]]." Castro became weary of Guevara's opposition to Soviet conditions and recommendations; measures that Castro saw as necessary, but which Guevara described as corrupt and "pre-monopolist."<ref>[http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&aid=9315 Che Guevara's Final Verdict on the Soviet Economy] by John Riddell, ''Centre for Research on Globalization'', June 13, 2008.</ref> However, both Guevara and Castro were supportive publicly on the idea of a united front.

Following the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] and what Guevara perceived as a Soviet betrayal when [[Nikita Khrushchev]] withdrew the missiles from Cuban territory, Guevara had grown more skeptical of the Soviet Union. As revealed in his last speech in Algiers, he had come to view the [[Northern Hemisphere]], led by the U.S. in the West and the Soviet Union in the East, as the exploiter of the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. He strongly supported Communist [[North Vietnam]] in the [[Vietnam War]], and urged the peoples of other developing countries to take up arms and create "many Vietnams."<ref name="MessTricont1967">[http://www.marxists.org/archive/guevara/1967/04/16.htm Message to the Tricontinental] A letter sent by Che Guevara from his jungle camp in Bolivia, to the Tricontinental Solidarity Organisation in Havana, Cuba, in the Spring of 1967.</ref>

Pressed by international speculation regarding Guevara's fate, Castro stated on June 16, 1965 that the people would be informed when Guevara himself wished to let them know. Still, rumors spread both inside and outside Cuba. On October 3, Castro revealed an undated letter purportedly written to him by Guevara some months earlier: in it, Guevara reaffirmed his enduring solidarity with the Cuban Revolution, but declared his intention to leave Cuba to fight for the revolutionary cause abroad. Additionally, he resigned from all his positions in the government and party, and renounced his honorary Cuban citizenship.<ref>[[#refGuevara1965|Guevara 1965]].</ref> Guevara's movements continued to be a closely guarded secret for the next two years.

==Congo==
[[File:CheInCongo1965.jpg|thumb|185px|left|A 37-year-old Guevara, in the [[Congo Crisis]], 1965.]]

In 1965, Guevara decided to venture to [[Africa]] and offer his knowledge and experience as a guerrilla to the ongoing [[Congo Crisis|conflict in the Congo]]. According to [[Algeria]]n President [[Ahmed Ben Bella]], Guevara thought that Africa was imperialism's weak link and therefore had enormous revolutionary potential.<ref>[[#refBenBella1997|Ben Bella 1997]].</ref> Egyptian President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], who had fraternal relations with Che dating back to his 1959 visit, saw Guevara's plans to fight in the Congo as "unwise" and warned that he would become a "[[Tarzan]]" figure, doomed to failure.<ref>[[#refAnderson1997|Anderson 1997]], p. 624.</ref> Despite the warning, Guevara traveled to the Congo while using the alias Ram<U+00F3>n Ben<U+00ED>tez.<ref>[[#refAnderson1997|Anderson 1997]], p. 629.</ref> Guevara led the Cuban operation in support of the Marxist Simba movement, which had emerged from the ongoing [[Congo Crisis]]. Guevara, his second-in-command [[Victor Dreke]], and 12 other Cuban expeditionaries arrived in the Congo on April 24, 1965 and a contingent of approximately 100 [[Afro-Cuban]]s joined them soon afterward.<ref>[[#refGalvez1999|G<U+00E1>lvez 1999]], p. 62.</ref><ref>[[#refGott2004|Gott 2004]] p. 219.</ref> They collaborated for a time with guerrilla leader [[Laurent-D<U+00E9>sir<U+00E9> Kabila]], who had previously helped supporters of the CIA-slain [[Patrice Lumumba]] lead an unsuccessful revolt months earlier.

Over the course of seven months Ilanga grew to "admire the hard-working Guevara", who according to Mr. Ilanga, "showed the same respect to black people as he did to whites."<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4522526.stm DR Congo's Rebel-Turned-Brain Surgeon] by Mark Doyle, ''BBC World Affairs', December 13, 2005.</ref> However Guevara soon became disillusioned with the discipline of Kabila's troops and later dismissed him, stating "nothing leads me to believe he is the man of the hour."<ref>[[#refBBCNews2001a|BBC News]] January 17, 2001.</ref>

As an additional obstacle, white [[South Africa]]n mercenaries, led by [[Mike Hoare]] in concert with Cuban exiles and the CIA, worked with the [[Force Publique|Congo National Army]] to thwart Guevara in the mountains near the village of [[Fizi]] on [[Lake Tanganyika]]. They were able to monitor his communications, and so pre-empted his attacks and interdicted his supply lines. Despite the fact that Guevara sought to conceal his presence in the Congo, the U.S. government was aware of his location and activities: The [[National Security Agency]] was intercepting all of his incoming and outgoing transmissions via equipment aboard the [[USNS Pvt Jose F Valdez|USNS ''Pvt Jose F. Valdez'' (T-AG-169)]], a floating listening post that continuously cruised the [[Indian Ocean]] off [[Dar es Salaam]] for that purpose.<ref>"The intercept operators knew that Dar-es-Salaam was serving as a communications center for the fighters, receiving messages from Castro in Cuba and relaying them on to the guerrillas deep in the bush<!--Is this all a quotation?--> ([[#refBamford2002|Bamford 2002]], p. 181).</ref>

Standing behind them is Roberto S<U+00E1>nchez ("Lawton" in Cuba and "Changa" in the Congo).]]

Guevara's aim was to [[export the revolution]] by instructing local anti-[[Mobutu Sese Seko|Mobutu]] Simba fighters in [[Marxist]] ideology and [[foco theory]] strategies of [[guerrilla warfare]]. In his ''Congo Diary'', he cites the incompetence, intransigence and infighting of the local Congolese forces as key reasons for the revolt's failure.<ref>[[#refIrelandsOwn2000|Ireland's Own 2000]].</ref> Later that year, ill with [[dysentery]], suffering from acute asthma, and disheartened after seven months of frustrations, Guevara left the Congo with the Cuban survivors (Six members of his column had died). At one point Guevara considered sending the wounded back to Cuba, and fighting in Congo alone until his death, as a revolutionary example; however, after being urged by his comrades and pressed by two emissaries sent by Castro, at the last moment he reluctantly agreed to retreat. In speaking about the Congo, Guevara concluded that "The human element failed. There is no will to fight, the leaders are corrupt; in a word, there was nothing to do."<ref>[[#refKellner1989|Kellner 1989]], p. 87.</ref> A few weeks later, when writing the preface to the diary he kept during the Congo venture, he began: "This is the history of a failure."<ref>[[#refGuevara2000|Guevara 2000]], p. 1.</ref>

Guevara was reluctant to return to Cuba, because Castro had made public Guevara's "farewell letter" <U+2014> a letter intended to only be revealed in the case of his death <U+2014> wherein he severed all ties in order to devote himself to revolution throughout the world.<ref>[[#refCastaneda1998|Casta<U+00F1>eda 1998]], p. 316.</ref> As a result, Guevara spent the next six months living clandestinely in [[Dar es Salaam]] and [[Prague]].<ref>[http://www.canada.com/health/Guevara+Czech+village+1966/2476096/story.html Che Guevara Hid in Czech Village in 1966] by ''[[Canwest]]'', January 23, 2010.</ref> During this time he compiled his memoirs of the Congo experience, and wrote drafts of two more books, one on philosophy and the other on economics. He then visited several Western European countries to test his new false identity papers, created by [[Intelligence Directorate|Cuban Intelligence]] for his later travels to South America. As Guevara prepared for Bolivia, he wrote a last letter to his five children to be read upon his death, which ended with him instructing them: {{quote|"Above all, always be capable of feeling deeply any injustice committed against anyone, anywhere in the world. This is the most beautiful quality in a revolutionary."<ref>[[#refGuevara2009|Guevara 2009]], p. 167.</ref>}}

In late 1966, Guevara's location was still not public knowledge, although representatives of [[Mozambique]]'s independence movement, the [[FRELIMO]], reported that they met with Guevara in late 1966 or early 1967 in Dar es Salaam regarding his offer to aid in their revolutionary project, which they ultimately rejected.<ref>[[#refMittleman1981|Mittleman 1981]], p. 38.</ref> In a speech at the 1967 [[International Workers' Day]] rally in Havana, the Acting Minister of the armed forces, Major [[Juan Almeida]], announced that Guevara was "serving the revolution somewhere in Latin America".

Before he departed for Bolivia, Guevara altered his appearance so he would be unrecognizable as Che Guevara.<ref>Jacobson, Sid and Ernie Col<U+00F3>n. ''Che: A Graphic Biography''.

[[File:CheinBolivia1.jpg|thumb|left|In rural [[Bolivia]] shortly before his death (1967)]]

Guevara's first base camp was located in the [[Tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests|montane dry forest]] in the remote <U+00D1>ancahuaz<U+00FA> region. Training at the camp in the <U+00D1>ancahuaz<U+00FA> valley however proved to be hazardous and little was accomplished in the way of building a guerrilla army. Former [[Stasi]] operative [[Tamara Bunke|Hayd<U+00E9>e Tamara Bunke Bider]], better known by her ''[[nom de guerre]]'' "Tania", who had been installed as his primary agent in [[La Paz]], was reportedly also working for the [[KGB]] and in several Western sources she is inferred to have unwittingly served Soviet interests by leading Bolivian authorities to Guevara's trail.<ref name="#refSelvage1985|Selvage 1985">[[#refSelvage1985|Selvage 1985]].</ref><ref>[[#refAnderson1997|Anderson 1997]], p. 693.</ref>

Guevara's guerrilla force, numbering about 50<ref>[http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/che/bolivia-guerrillas.htm Members of Che Guevara's Guerrilla Movement in Bolivia] by the ''Latin American Studies Organization''
</ref> and operating as the ELN (''Ej<U+00E9>rcito de Liberaci<U+00F3>n Nacional de Bolivia''; "[[National Liberation Army of Bolivia]]"), was well equipped and scored a number of early successes against Bolivian army regulars in the difficult terrain of the mountainous [[Camiri]] region. As a result of Guevara<U+2019>s units winning several skirmishes against Bolivian troops in the spring and summer of 1967, the Bolivian government began to overestimate the true size of the guerrilla force.<ref>[[#refKellner1989|Kellner 1989]], p. 97.</ref> But in September, the Army managed to eliminate two guerrilla groups in a violent battle, reportedly killing one of the leaders.

[[File:Vallegrande location.png|thumb|right|Location of [[Vallegrande]] in Bolivia]]

Researchers hypothesize that Guevara's plan for fomenting revolution in Bolivia failed, for an array of reasons:

* He had expected to deal only with the Bolivian military, who were poorly trained and equipped. However, Guevara was unaware that the U.S. government had sent a team of the CIA's [[Special Activities Division]] commandos and other operatives into Bolivia to aid the anti-insurrection effort. The [[Bolivian Army]] would also be trained, advised, and supplied by [[Special Forces (United States Army)|U.S. Army Special Forces]] including a recently organized elite battalion of [[United States Army Rangers|Rangers]] trained in [[jungle warfare]] that set up camp in La Esperanza, a small settlement close to the location of Guevara's guerrillas.<ref>[[#refUSArmy1967|U.S. Army 1967]] and [[#refRyan1998|Ryan 1998]], pp. 82<U+2013>102, ''inter alia''. "U.S. military personnel in Bolivia never exceeded 53 advisers, including a sixteen-man Mobile Training Team (MTT) from the [[8th Special Forces Group (United States)|8th Special Forces Group]] based at [[Fort Gulick]], [[Panama Canal Zone]]" ([[#refSelvage1985|Selvage 1985]]).</ref>
* Guevara had expected assistance and cooperation from the local dissidents which he did not receive, nor did he receive support from Bolivia's Communist Party, under the leadership of [[Mario Monje]], which was oriented toward Moscow rather than Havana. In Guevara's own diary captured after his death, he bristled with complaints about the [[Communist Party of Bolivia]], which he characterized as "distrustful, disloyal and stupid."<ref>"[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,837605,00.html Bidding for Che]", ''Time Magazine'', Dec. 15, 1967.</ref>
* He had expected to remain in radio contact with Havana. However, the two [[shortwave]] transmitters provided to him by Cuba were faulty; thus the guerrillas were unable to communicate with and be resupplied, leaving them isolated and stranded.

In addition, Guevara's known preference for confrontation rather than compromise, which had previously surfaced during his guerrilla warfare campaign in Cuba, contributed to his inability to develop successful working relationships with local leaders in Bolivia, just as it had in the Congo.<ref>[[#refGuevara1972|Guevara 1972]].</ref> This tendency had existed in Cuba, but had been kept in check by the timely interventions and guidance of Fidel Castro.<ref>[[#refCastaneda1998|Casta<U+00F1>eda 1998]], pp. 107<U+2013>112; 131<U+2013>132.</ref> 

The end result was that Guevara was unable to attract inhabitants of the local area to join his militia during the 11 months he attempted recruitment. Near the end of the venture Guevara complained in his diary that "the peasants do not give us any help, and are turning into informers."<ref>[[#refWright2000|Wright 2000]], p. 86.</ref>

On October 7, an informant apprised the Bolivian Special Forces of the location of Guevara's guerrilla encampment in the Yuro ravine. They encircled the area with 1,800 soldiers, and Guevara was wounded and taken prisoner while leading a detachment with [[Sime<U+00F3>n Cuba Sarabia]]. Che biographer [[Jon Lee Anderson]] reports Bolivian Sergeant Bernardino Huanca's account: that a twice wounded Guevara, his gun rendered useless, shouted "Do not shoot! I am Che Guevara and worth more to you alive than dead."<ref>[[#refAnderson1997|Anderson 1997]], p. 733.</ref>

Guevara was tied up and taken to a dilapidated mud schoolhouse in the nearby village of [[La Higuera]] on the night of October 7. For the next day-and-a-half, Guevara refused to be interrogated by Bolivian officers and would only speak quietly to Bolivian soldiers. One of those Bolivian soldiers, helicopter pilot Jaime Nino de Guzman, describes Che as looking "dreadful". According to Guzman, Guevara was shot through the right calf, his hair was matted with dirt, his clothes were shredded, and his feet were covered in rough leather sheaths. Despite his haggard appearance, he recounts that "Che held his head high, looked everyone straight in the eyes and asked only for something to smoke." De Guzman states that he "took pity" and gave him a small bag of tobacco for his pipe, with Guevara then smiling and thanking him.<ref name="The Man Who Buried Che">"[http://www.fiu.edu/~fcf/cheremains111897.html The Man Who Buried Che]" by Juan O. Tamayo, ''Miami Herald'', September 19, 1997.</ref> Later on the night of October 8, Guevara, despite having his hands tied, kicked Bolivian Officer Espinosa into the wall, after the officer entered the schoolhouse in order to snatch Guevara's pipe from his mouth as a souvenir.<ref name="Mich<U+00E8>le">{{cite journal |title=In Cold Blood: The Execution of Che by the CIA |first=Mich<U+00E8>le |last=Ray |journal=Ramparts Magazine |month=March |year=1968 |page=33}}</ref> In another instance of defiance, Guevara spat in the face of Bolivian Rear Admiral Ugarteche shortly before his execution.<ref name="Mich<U+00E8>le" />

The following morning on October 9, Guevara asked to see the ''"maestra"'' (school teacher) of the village, 22-year-old Julia Cortez. Cortez would later state that she found Guevara to be an "agreeable looking man with a soft and ironic glance" and that during their conversation she found herself "unable to look him in the eye", because his "gaze was unbearable, piercing, and so tranquil."<ref name="Mich<U+00E8>le" /> During their short conversation, Guevara complained to Cortez about the poor condition of the schoolhouse, stating that it was "anti-[[Pedagogy|pedagogical]]" to expect campesino students to be educated there, while "government officials drive [[Mercedes (car)|Mercedes]] cars" ... declaring "that's what we are fighting against."<ref name="Mich<U+00E8>le" />

Later that morning on October 9, Bolivian President [[Ren<U+00E9> Barrientos]] ordered that Guevara be killed. The order was relayed by F<U+00E9>lix Rodr<U+00ED>guez despite the US government<U+2019>s desire that Guevara be taken to Panama.<ref>[[#refGrant2007|Grant 2007]]</ref>. The executioner was [[Mario Ter<U+00E1>n]], a half-drunken sergeant in the Bolivian army who had requested to shoot Che on the basis of the fact that three of his friends from B Company, all named "Mario", had been killed in an earlier firefight with Guevara's band of guerrillas.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> To make the bullet wounds appear consistent with the story the government planned to release to the public, F<U+00E9>lix Rodr<U+00ED>guez ordered Ter<U+00E1>n to aim carefully to make it appear that Guevara had been killed in action during a clash with the Bolivian army.<ref>[[#refGrant2007|Grant 2007]]. Ren<U+00E9> Barrientos has never revealed his motives for ordering the summary execution of Guevara.</ref> Gary Prado, a Bolivian soldier who was with the group that captured Guevara, said that the reasons Barrientos ordered the immediate execution of Guevara is so there would be no possibility that Guevara would escape from prison, and also so there would be no drama in regard to a trial.<ref>Almudevar, Lola.

Moments before Guevara was executed he was asked if he was thinking about his own immortality. "No", he replied, "I'm thinking about the immortality of the revolution."<ref>[[#refTime1970|''Time'' magazine 1970]].</ref> When Sergeant Ter<U+00E1>n entered the hut, Che Guevara then told his executioner, "I know you've come to kill me. Shoot, coward! You are only going to kill a man!"<ref>[[#refAnderson1997|Anderson 1997]], p. 739.</ref> Ter<U+00E1>n hesitated, then opened fire with his semiautomatic rifle, hitting Guevara in the arms and legs. Guevara writhed on the ground, apparently biting one of his wrists to avoid crying out. Ter<U+00E1>n then fired several times again, wounding him fatally in the chest at 1:10 pm, according to Rodr<U+00ED>guez.<ref>[[#refAnderson1997|Anderson 1997]], p. 739.</ref> In all, Guevara was shot nine times. This included five times in the legs, once in the right shoulder and arm, once in the chest, and finally in the throat.<ref name="Mich<U+00E8>le" />

Months earlier, during his last public declaration to the [[Tricontinental Conference]],<ref name="MessTricont1967" /> Guevara wrote his own [[epitaph]], stating "Wherever death may surprise us, let it be welcome, provided that this our battle cry may have reached some receptive ear and another hand may be extended to wield our weapons."<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/jan/19/che-guevara-obituary-guardian-archive Obituary: Che Guevara, Marxist Architect of Revolution] by Richard Bourne, ''[[The Guardian]]'', October 11, 1967</ref>

After his execution, Guevara's body was lashed to the landing skids of a helicopter and flown to nearby [[Vallegrande]], where photographs were taken of him lying on a concrete slab in the laundry room of the Nuestra Se<U+00F1>ora de Malta.<ref>[[#refAlmudevar2007|Almudevar 2007]] and [[#refGott2005|Gott 2005]].</ref> As hundreds of local residents filed past the body, many of them considered Guevara's corpse to represent a "Christ-like" visage, with some of them even surreptitiously clipping locks of his hair as divine relics.<ref>[[#refCasey2009|Casey 2009]], p. 179.</ref> Such comparisons were further extended when two weeks later upon seeing the post-mortem photographs, English art critic [[John Berger]] observed that they resembled two famous paintings: [[Rembrandt]]'s ''[[The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp]]'' and [[Andrea Mantegna]]'s ''[[Lamentation over the Dead Christ (Mantegna)|Lamentation over the Dead Christ]]''.<ref>[[#refCasey2009|Casey 2009]], p. 183.</ref> There were also four correspondents present when Guevara's body arrived in Vallegrande, including [[Bjorn Kumm]] of the Swedish ''[[Aftonbladet]]'', who described the scene in an November 11, 1967, exclusive for ''[[The New Republic]]''.<ref>[http://www.tnr.com/article/politics/the-death-che-guevara The Death of Che Guevara] by [[Bjorn Kumm]], ''[[The New Republic]]'', Originally published on November 11, 1967.</ref> 

A declassified memorandum dated October 11, 1967 to [[President of the United States|United States President]] [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] from his [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]], [[Walt Whitman Rostow]], called the decision to kill Guevara "stupid" but "understandable from a Bolivian standpoint."<ref>[[#refLacey2007a|Lacey 2007a]].</ref> After the execution, Rodr<U+00ED>guez took several of Guevara's personal items, including a [[Rolex GMT Master]] wristwatch<ref>[http://www.watchblog.dk/pictures/people/slides/cheGMT.jpg Watch blog image of Guevara's GMT Master].</ref> which he continued to wear many years later, often showing them to reporters during the ensuing years.<ref>[http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/JFKroderiguez.htm Felix Rodr<U+00ED>guez entry] from ''Spartacus Schoolnet Encyclopedia''.</ref> Today, some of these belongings, including his flashlight, are on display at the CIA.<ref>[[#refKornbluh1997|Kornbluh 1997]].</ref> After a military doctor amputated his hands, Bolivian army officers transferred Guevara's body to an undisclosed location and refused to reveal whether his remains had been buried or cremated. The hands were preserved in [[formaldehyde]] to be sent to Buenos Aires for fingerprint identification. (His fingerprints were on file with the Argentine police.) They were later sent to Cuba.

Under the image is Guevara's motto, the Spanish phrase: ''"Hasta la Victoria Siempre"'' (English: Until the Everlasting Victory Always).]] 

On October 15, [[Fidel Castro]] acknowledged that Guevara was dead and proclaimed three days of public mourning throughout the island.<ref>[[#refAnderson1997|Anderson 1997]], p. 740.</ref> On October 18, Castro addressed a crowd of one million mourners in Havana's [[Plaza de la Revoluci<U+00F3>n]] and spoke about Guevara's character as a revolutionary.<ref>[[#refAnderson1997|Anderson 1997]], p. 741.</ref> Fidel Castro closed his impassioned eulogy thusly:
{{quote|"If we wish to express what we want the men of future generations to be, we must say: Let them be like Che! If we wish to say how we want our children to be educated, we must say without hesitation: We want them to be educated in Che<U+2019>s spirit!

[[French people|French]] [[intellectual]] [[R<U+00E9>gis Debray]], who was captured in April 1967 while with Guevara in Bolivia, gave an interview from prison, in August 1968, where he enlarged on the circumstances of Guevara's capture. Debray, who had lived with Guevara's band of guerrillas for a short time, said that in his view they were "victims of the forest" and thus "eaten by the jungle."<ref name="Nadle">{{cite journal |title=R<U+00E9>gis Debray Speaks from Prison |first=Marlene |last=Nadle |journal=Ramparts Magazine |date=August 24, 1968 |page=42}}</ref> Debray described a destitute situation where Guevara's men suffered malnutrition, lack of water, absence of shoes, and only possessed six blankets for 22 men. Debray recounts that Guevara and the others had been suffering an "illness" which caused their hands and feet to swell into "mounds of flesh" to the point where you could not discern the fingers on their hands.<ref name="Nadle" /> Despite the futile situation, Debray described Guevara as "optimistic about the future of Latin America" and remarked that Guevara was "resigned to die in the knowledge that his death would be a sort of renaissance", noting that Guevara perceived death "as a promise of rebirth" and "ritual of renewal."<ref name="Nadle" />

In late 1995, retired Bolivian General Mario Vargas revealed to [[Jon Lee Anderson]], author of ''Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life'', that Guevara's body was located near a [[Vallegrande]] airstrip. The result was a multi-national search for the remains, which would last more than a year. In July 1997, a team of Cuban [[geologist]]s and Argentine [[forensic anthropology|forensic anthropologists]] discovered the remnants of seven bodies in two mass graves, including one man with amputated hands (like Guevara). Bolivian government officials with the Ministry of Interior later identified the body as Guevara when the excavated teeth "perfectly matched" a plaster mold of Che's teeth, made in Cuba prior to his Congolese expedition. The "clincher" then arrived when Argentine forensic anthropologist Alejandro Inchaurregui inspected the inside hidden pocket of a blue jacket dug up next to the handless cadaver and found a small bag of pipe tobacco. Nino de Guzman, the Bolivian helicopter pilot who had given Che a small bag of tobacco, later remarked that he "had serious doubts" at first and "thought the Cubans would just find any old bones and call it Che"; however he stated "after hearing about the tobacco pouch, I have no doubts."<ref name="The Man Who Buried Che"/> On October 17, 1997, Guevara's remains, with those of six of his fellow combatants, were laid to rest with military honors in a specially built [[Mausoleo Che Guevara|mausoleum]] in the Cuban city of [[Santa Clara, Cuba|Santa Clara]], where he had commanded over the [[Battle of Santa Clara|decisive military victory]] of the [[Cuban Revolution]].<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9710/17/cuba.che/ Cuba salutes 'Che' Guevara: Revolutionary Icon Finally Laid to Rest] CNN, October 17, 1997 [http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9710/17/cuba.che/cuba.17.mov CNN VIDEO].</ref>

Removed when Guevara was captured was his 30,000-word, hand-written diary, a collection of his personal poetry, and a short story he authored about a young Communist guerrilla who learns to overcome his fears.<ref>"[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,837605,00.html Bidding for Che]", Time Magazine, Dec. 15, 1967.</ref> His diary documented events of the guerrilla campaign in Bolivia<ref>[[#refGuevara1967b|Guevara 1967b]].</ref> with the first entry on November 7, 1966 shortly after his arrival at the farm in <U+00D1>ancahuaz<U+00FA>, and the last dated October 7, 1967, the day before his capture. The diary tells how the guerrillas were forced to begin operations prematurely because of discovery by the Bolivian Army, explains Guevara's decision to divide the column into two units that were subsequently unable to re-establish contact, and describes their overall unsuccessful venture. It also records the rift between Guevara and the Communist Party of Bolivia that resulted in Guevara having significantly fewer soldiers than originally expected and shows that Guevara had a great deal of difficulty recruiting from the local populace, partly because of the fact that the guerrilla group had learned [[Quechua]], unaware that the local language was actually [[Tup<U+00ED>-Guaran<U+00ED>]].<ref>[[#refRyan1998|Ryan 1998]], p. 45.</ref> As the campaign drew to an unexpected close, Guevara became increasingly ill. He suffered from ever-worsening bouts of asthma, and most of his last offensives were carried out in an attempt to obtain medicine.<ref>[[#refRyan1998|Ryan 1998]], p. 104.</ref>

The Bolivian Diary was quickly and crudely translated by ''[[Ramparts (magazine)|Ramparts]]'' magazine and circulated around the world.<ref>[[#refRyan1998|Ryan 1998]], p. 148.</ref> There are at least four additional diaries in existence<U+2014>those of Israel Reyes Zayas (Alias "Braulio"), Harry Villegas Tamayo ([[Harry "Pombo" Villegas|"Pombo"]]), Eliseo Reyes Rodriguez ("Rolando")<ref name="#refSelvage1985|Selvage 1985"/> and Dariel Alarc<U+00F3>n Ram<U+00ED>rez ("Benigno")<ref>[[#refRamirez1997|Ram<U+00ED>rez 1997]].</ref><U+2014>each of which reveals additional aspects of the events. In July 2008, the Bolivian government of [[Evo Morales]] unveiled Guevara's formerly sealed diaries composed in two frayed notebooks, along with a logbook and several black-and-white photographs. At this event, Bolivia's vice minister of culture, Pablo Groux, expressed that there were plans to publish photographs of every handwritten page later in the year.<ref>[http://www.reuters.com/article/lifestyleMolt/idUSN0743477420080707?pageNumber=1&virtualBrandChannel=0 Bolivia unveils original Che Guevara diary] by Eduardo Garcia, Reuters, July 7, 2008.</ref> Meanwhile, in August 2009, anthropologists working for Bolivia's Justice Ministry discovered and unearthed five of Guevara's fellow guerrillas near the Bolivian town of Teoponte.<ref>[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/08/090821-che-guevara-find-video-ap.html Slain Che Guevara Soldiers Found?] video report by ''[[National Geographic]]'', August 21, 2009.</ref>

Over forty years after his execution, Che's life and legacy still remain a contentious issue. The contradictions of his ethos at various points in his life have created a complex character of unending duality.
