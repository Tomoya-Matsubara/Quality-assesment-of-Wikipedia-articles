"'''Nearer, My God, to Thee'''" is a 19th century [[hymn|Christian hymn]] by [[Sarah Flower Adams]], based loosely on [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 28:11<U+2013>19,<ref>[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2028:11-12;&version=8; Genesis 28:11-12]</ref> the story of [[Jacob's Ladder (Bible)|Jacob's dream]].  Genesis 28:11<U+2013>12 can be translated as follows: "So he came to a certain place and stayed there all night, because the sun had set. And he took one of the stones of that place and put it at his head, and he lay down in that place to sleep.  Then he dreamed, and behold, a ladder was set up on the earth, and its top reached to heaven; and there the angels of God were ascending and descending on it..."  

It is most famous as the alleged last song the band on [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']] played before the ship sank.

The lyrics to the hymn are as follows:<ref name=CyberHymnal>[http://www.hymntime.com/tch/htm/n/m/nmgtthee.htm Nearer, My God, to Thee] at CyberHymnal</ref><ref>[http://www.hymnsite.com/lyrics/umh528.sht Nearer, My God, to Thee] at Hymnsite.com</ref><ref>[http://www.surfinthespirit.com/music/nearer2.html Nearer My God to Thee] at Christian Music</ref>

:Nearer, my God, to Thee, nearer to Thee!
:E'en though it be a cross that raiseth me;
:Still all my song shall be nearer, my God, to Thee,

::'''Chorus:''' Nearer, my God, to Thee, nearer to Thee!

:Though like the wanderer, the sun gone down,
:Darkness be over me, my rest a stone;
:Yet in my dreams I'd be nearer, my God, to Thee,

::'''Chorus'''

:There let the way appear steps unto heav'n;
:All that Thou sendest me in mercy giv'n;
:Angels to beckon me nearer, my God, to Thee,

::'''Chorus'''

:Then with my waking thoughts bright with Thy praise,
:Out of my stony griefs Bethel I'll raise;
:So by my woes to be nearer, my God, to Thee,

::'''Chorus'''

:Or if on joyful wing, cleaving the sky,
:Sun, moon, and stars forgot, upwards I fly,
:Still all my song shall be, nearer, my God, to Thee,

A sixth verse was later added to the hymn by Ed<U+00AD>ward H. Bick<U+00AD>er<U+00AD>steth, Jr. as follows:<ref name=CyberHymnal/>

:There in my Father<U+2019>s home, safe and at rest,
:There in my Savior<U+2019>s love, perfectly blest;
:Age after age to be, nearer my God to Thee.

::'''Chorus'''

==Text and music==
The verse was written by the English poet and [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] hymn writer [[Sarah Fuller Flower Adams|Sarah Flower Adams]] (1805<U+2013>1848) at her home in Sunnybank, [[Loughton]], [[Essex]], England, in 1841.  It was first set to music by Adams's sister, the composer [[Eliza Flower]], for [[William Johnson Fox]]'s collection ''Hymns and Anthems''.<ref>{{cite book | last = Taylor & Francis Group | title = A Historical Dictionary of British Women | publisher = [[Routledge]] | year = 2003 | pages = 3 and 171 | url = http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=pDtEe4FKolUC | isbn =1857432282 }}</ref>

In the United Kingdom, the hymn is usually associated with the 1861 [[hymn tune]] "[[Horbury (song)|Horbury]]" by [[John Bacchus Dykes]], named for [[Horbury|a village]] near [[Wakefield]], England, where Dykes had found "peace and comfort".<ref>''The Musical Times'', January 1898, p. 22</ref>  In the rest of the world, the hymn is usually sung to the 1856 tune "[[Bethany (song)|Bethany]]" by [[Lowell Mason]].  [[Methodism|Methodists]] prefer the tune "[[Propior Deo (song)|Propior Deo]]" (Nearer to God), written by [[Arthur Sullivan]] (of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]) in 1872.  Sullivan wrote a second setting of the hymn to a tune referred to as "St. Edmund".  Other 19th century settings include those by the Rev. N. S. Godfrey,<ref>''[[The Musical Times]]'',  October 1853, p. 270</ref> W. H. Longhurst,<ref>''The Musical Times'', March 1860, p. 223</ref> Herbert Columbine,<ref>''The Musical Times'', December 1865, p. 192</ref> Frederic N. L<U+00F6>hr,<ref>''The Musical Times'', December 1874, p. 730</ref> Thomas Adams,<ref>''The Musical Times'', February 1895, p. 102</ref> and one composed jointly by [[William Sterndale Bennett]] and [[Otto Goldschmidt]].<ref>''The Musical Times'', March 1902, p. 19</ref>  In 1955, the English composer and [[musicologist]] [[Jack Westrup|Sir Jack Westrup]] composed a setting in the form of an anthem for four soloists with organ accompaniment.<ref>''The Musical Times'', May 1955, p. 1</ref>

==RMS Titanic and SS Valencia==
"Nearer, My God, to Thee" is associated with the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']], as one passenger reported that the ship's band played the hymn as the Titanic sank.  The "Bethany" version was used in the 1943 film ''[[Titanic (1943 film)|Titanic]]'' and in the [[Jean Negulesco|Jean Negulesco's]] 1953 film ''[[Titanic (1953 film)|Titanic]],'' whereas the "Horbury" version was played in [[Roy Ward Baker|Roy Ward Baker's]] 1958 movie about the sinking, ''[[A Night to Remember (1958 film)|A Night to Remember]]''.  The "Bethany" version was again used in [[James Cameron]]'s 1997 ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]''.<ref>Bevil, J. Marshall. [http://home.earthlink.net/~llywarch/tnc02.html.htm "And the Band Played On ..."] Article analyzing which version was likely played at the sinking of the Titanic]</ref>

[[Wallace Hartley]], the ship's band leader, who like all the musicians on board went down with the ship, was known to like the song and to wish to have it performed at his funeral. He was British and Methodist, and would have been familiar with both the "Horbury" and "Propior Deo" versions, but not with "Bethany". His father, a Methodist choirmaster, used the "Propior Deo" version at church for over thirty years. His family were certain he would have used the "Propior Deo" version, and it is this tune's opening notes that appear on Hartley's memorial.<ref>[http://www.allatsea.co.za/hartley.htm Tribute to the Titanic's band and discussion of what was played]</ref><ref>[http://www.pendle.net/WallaceHartley/ Biography of Wallace Hartley, the Titanic's bandmaster]</ref>  However, a record slip for a 1913 Edison cylinder recording of "Nearer, My God, to Thee", featuring the "Bethany" version, states that "When the great steamship 'Titanic' sank in mid-ocean in April 1912, it was being played by the band and sung by the doomed passengers, even as the boat took her final plunge."<ref>Dethlefson, Ronald. ''Edison Blue Amberol Recordings, 1912-1914''. APM Press: Brooklyn, 1980, p. 53.  The cylinder is numbered Edison Blue Amberol No. 1647.</ref> 

"Nearer, My God, to Thee" was also sung by the doomed crew and passengers of the [[SS Valencia|SS ''Valencia'']] as it sank off the Canadian coast in 1905 <U+2013> indeed it may be the source of the Titanic legend, since the Titanic claim is made by a Canadian passenger who could not have actually heard the band playing.<ref>Baily, Clarence H. "The Wreck of the Valencia", in ''Pacific Monthly'', March 1906, p. 281, quoted by Richard Howells in the ''The Myth of the Titanic'', ISBN 0-333-72597-2</ref>

==Quotations in musical compositions==
A dramatic paraphrase of the hymn tune was written for [[wind band]] by the [[Denmark|Danish]] composer, [[Carl Nielsen]].  His version includes a musical rendition of the collision between boat and iceberg.<ref>[http://carlnielsen.dk/pages/vaerkoversigt/orkestermusik.php "Orkestermusik"], Carl Nielsen Selskabet, accessed 14 January 2010</ref> The composer [[Sigfrid Karg-Elert]], moved by the Titanic tragedy, wrote six works based on the "Bethany" setting, including an organ fantasia.<ref>''The Musical Times'', January 1973, pp. 33<U+2013>34; and May 1973, p. 489</ref> "Bethany" is also quoted in [[Charles Ives]]'s fourth symphony.<ref>Ballantine, Christopher. "Charles Ives and the Meaning of Quotation in Music", ''The Musical Quarterly'', April 1979, p. 174</ref>  The hymn even made its way briefly onto the operatic stage.  The singer [[Emma Abbott]], prompted by "her uncompromising and grotesque puritanism" rewrote ''[[La traviata]]'' so that Violetta expired singing not [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]]'s ''Addio del passato'', but ''Nearer my God to Thee''.<ref>''The Musical Times'', May 1891, p. 274.</ref>

==Other associations==
Another tale, surrounding the death of [[President of the United States|President]] [[William McKinley]] in September 1901, quotes his dying words as being the first few lines of the hymn.<ref name="McKinley biography">[http://mckinleydeath.com/documents/books/LWMch34.htm Excerpt from McKinley biography]</ref>  At 3:30 pm, in the afternoon of September 14, 1901, after five minutes of silence across the nation, numerous bands across the United States played the hymn, McKinley's favorite, in his memory.<ref name="McKinley biography"/> It was also played by the Marine Band on [[Pennsylvania Avenue]] during the funeral procession through Washington and at the end of the funeral service itself,<ref name="McKinley biography"/> and at a memorial service for him in [[Westminster Abbey]], London.<ref>''The Musical Times'',  October  1901, p. 665</ref>  It was also played as the body of assassinated American President [[James Garfield]] was interred at Lakeview Cemetery in [[Cleveland, Ohio]], and at the funeral of former United States President [[Gerald R. Ford]].

The [[Rough Riders]] sang the hymn at the burial of their slain comrades after the [[Battle of Las Guasimas]].<ref>Brown, Theron and Hezekiah Butterworth. [http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18444 ''The Story of the Hymns and Tunes''] (1906)</ref> A film called ''Nearer My God to Thee'' was made in 1917 in the UK.

At the beginning of ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]'' (2007), Green Day is seen playing a concert in Springfield on a barge.  The audience pelts the band with stones.  As the barge begins to sink, bassist [[Mike Dirnt]] quotes the film ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'', uttering Hartley's line, "Gentlemen, it's been an honor playing with you tonight."<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120338/quotes IMDB list of "memorable quotes]</ref>  The band members all take out violins and begin to play "Nearer, My God, to Thee" while sinking. This ''Titanic'' gag was also used in the film ''[[Osmosis Jones]]'', but the line is changed to "Gentlemen, playing with you has been the greatest pleasure of my life."{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} In the ''[[South Park]]'' episode, "[[Summer Sucks]]", the boys play "Nearer, My God, to Thee" during the pandemonium after the giant [[Black snake (firework)|snake]] firework is lit.<ref>[http://southpark.wikia.com/wiki/Summer_Sucks "Summer Sucks"] episode of ''South Park'' at Southpark.wikia.com, accessed 11 January 2010</ref>

[[Ted Turner]], speaking shortly before the launch of [[CNN]], promised that, barring technical problems, "We won't be signing off until the world ends.  We'll be on, and we will cover the end of the world, live, and that will be our last event.... and when the end of the world comes, we'll play 'Nearer My God to Thee' before we sign off."<ref>[http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/ArticlePrintable.jsp?id=h-2643 Quote from Ted Turner]</ref>
