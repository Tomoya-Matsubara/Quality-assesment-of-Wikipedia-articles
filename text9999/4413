'''''Russula virescens''''' is a [[basidiomycete]] [[mushroom]] of the [[genus]] ''[[Russula]]'', and is commonly known as the '''green-cracking Russula''', the '''quilted green Russula''', or the '''green brittlegill'''. It can be recognized by its distinctive pale green [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] that measures up to {{convert|15|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} in diameter, the surface of which is covered with darker green angular patches. It has crowded white [[lamella (mycology)|gills]], and a firm, white [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] that is up to {{convert|8|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} tall and {{convert|4|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick. Considered to be one of the best [[edible mushroom]]s of the genus ''Russula'', it is especially popular in Spain and China. With a taste that is described variously as mild, nutty, fruity, or sweet, it is cooked by [[grilling]], [[frying]], [[saut<U+00E9>eing]], or eaten raw. Mushrooms are rich in [[carbohydrate]]s and [[dietary protein|proteins]], with a low [[fat]] content.

The species was described as new to science in 1774 by [[Jacob Christian Schaeffer]]. Its distribution encompasses Asia, North Africa, Europe, and Central America. Its presence in North America has not been clarified, due to confusion with the similar species ''[[Russula parvovirescens]]'' and ''[[Russula crustosa|R.&nbsp;crustosa]]''. ''R.&nbsp;virescens'' fruits singly or scattered on the ground in both [[deciduous]] and [[mixed forest]]s, forming [[mycorrhiza]]l associations with broadleaf trees such as [[oak]], [[Fagus sylvatica|European beech]], and [[aspen]]. In Asia, it associates with several species of tropical lowland [[rainforest]] trees of the family [[Dipterocarpaceae]]. The [[ribonuclease]] enzyme of ''R.&nbsp;virescens'' has been studied and shown to have a unique [[biochemistry]] compared to other edible mushrooms. Mushrooms contain [[biological activity|biologically active]] [[polysaccharide]]s, and a [[laccase]] enzyme that can break down several [[dye]]s used in the laboratory and in the [[textile industry]].

[[File:Russula virescens illustration 1898.jpg|thumb|left|1898 illustration by [[Louis Charles Christopher Krieger]]]]
''Russula virescens'' was first described by German [[polymath]] [[Jacob Christian Schaeffer]] in 1774 as ''Agaricus virescens''.<ref name="Schaeffer 1774"/> The species was subsequently transferred to the genus ''Russula'' by [[Elias Magnus Fries|Elias Fries]] in 1836.<ref name="Fries 1836"/><ref name="urlFungorum: Russula virescens"/> According to the [[Scientific nomenclature|nomenclatural]] authority [[MycoBank]], ''Russula furcata'' var. ''aeruginosa'' (published by [[Christian Hendrik Persoon]] in 1796<ref name="Persoon 1796"/>) and ''Agaricus caseosus'' (published by [[Karl Friedrich Wilhelm Wallroth]] in 1883<ref name="Wallroth 1833"/>) are [[synonym (biology)|synonyms]] of ''Russula virescens''.<ref name="urlMycoBank: Russula virescens"/> The [[variety (botany)|variety]] ''albidocitrina'', defined by [[Claude Casimir Gillet]] in 1876,<ref name="Gillet 1876"/> is no longer considered to have independent [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] significance.<ref name="urlMycoBank: Russula virescens var. albidocitrina"/> According to [[Rolf Singer]]'s 1986 [[classification (biology)|classification]] of ''Russula'', ''R.&nbsp;virescens'' is the [[type species]] of [[Subsection#Ranks in botany|subsection]] ''Virescentinae'' in section ''Rigidae'', a grouping of mushrooms characterized by a cap surface that breaks into patches of bran-like (furfuraceous) particles.<ref name="Singer 1986"/> In a [[molecular phylogenetic]] analysis of European ''Russula'', ''R.&nbsp;virescens'' formed a [[clade]] with ''[[Russula mustelina|R.&nbsp;mustelina]]''; these two species were [[sister group|sister]] to a clade containing ''[[Russula amoenicolor|R.&nbsp;amoenicolor]]'' and ''[[Russula violeipes|R.&nbsp;violeipes]]''.<ref name="Miller 2002"/>

The [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''virescens'' is [[Latin]] for "becoming green".<ref name="Findlay 1967"/> The characteristic pattern of the cap surface has earned the species [[common name]]s such as the green-cracking Russula, the quilted green Russula,<ref name="Arora 1986"/> and the green brittlegill.<ref name="McKnight 1987"/> In the [[mid-Atlantic United States]], it is also known locally as the moldy Russula.<ref name="Russell 2006"/>

== Description ==

Described by mushroom enthusiast [[Antonio Carluccio]] as "not exactly nice to look at", the [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] is at first dome or barrel-shaped, becoming convex and flattened with age with a diameter of up to {{convert|15|cm|in|0|abbr=on}}. The cap center is often depressed.<ref name="Carluccio 2003"/> The [[pileipellis|cuticle]] of the cap is green, most profoundly in the center, with patches of the same color dispersed radially around the center in an [[wikt:areolate|areolate]] pattern.<ref name="McKnight 1987"/> The color of the cuticle is often of variable shade, ranging from gray to [[verdigris]] to grass-green. The extent of the patching of the cuticle is also variable, giving specimens with limited patches a resemblance to other green-capped species of ''Russula'', such as ''[[Russula aeruginea|R.&nbsp;aeruginea]]''. The green patches of the cap lie on a white to pale green background. The cap, while frequently round, may also exhibit irregular lobes and cracks. The cap cuticle is thin, and can be readily peeled off the surface to a distance of about halfway towards the cap center.<ref name="McKnight 1987"/>
The [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] are white to cream colored, and fairly crowded together; they are mortly free from attachment to the [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]]. Gills are interconnected at their bases by veins.<ref name="urlRogers Mushrooms"/> The stipe is cylindrical, white, and of variable height, up to {{convert|8|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} tall and {{convert|4|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} wide;<ref name="Petersen 1990"/> it is roughly the same thickness at both the top and the base. The top portion of the stipe may be farinose<U+2014>covered with a white, mealy powder.<ref name="Jordan 2004"/> It may turn slightly brown with age, or when it is injured or bruised from handling.<ref name="Healy 2008"/> Like other mushrooms in the [[Russulales]], the [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is brittle, owing to the sphaerocyst cytoarchitecture<U+2014>cylindrical cells that contrast with the typical fibrous, filamentous [[hypha]]e present in other orders of the [[basidiomycota]].<ref name="urlRussulales News / Characteristics of the russuloid fungi"/>
[[File:Russula virescens 105520.jpg|thumb|left|Spores are translucent and warted.]]
The [[basidiospore|spores]] of ''R.&nbsp;virescens'' are elliptical or [[ellipsoid]] with warts, translucent ([[hyaline]]), and produce a white, pale or pale yellow [[spore print]];<ref name="Arora 1986"/><ref name="Hinkova 1986"/> the spore dimensions are 6<U+2013>9 by 5<U+2013>7&nbsp;[[micrometre|<U+00B5>m]].<ref name="Arora 1986"/> A partial reticulum (net-like pattern of ridges) interconnects the warts. The spore-bearing cells, the [[basidia]], are club-shaped and have dimensions of 24<U+2013>33 by 6<U+2013>7.5&nbsp;<U+00B5>m; they are colorless, and each hold from two to four spores. The pleurocystidia ([[cystidia]] on the gill face) are 40<U+2013>85 by 6<U+2013>8&nbsp;<U+00B5>m and end abruptly in a sharp point.<ref name="Bi 1993"/>

=== Similar species ===
''Russula parvovirescens'', found in the eastern United States, can be distinguished from ''R.&nbsp;virescens'' by its smaller stature, with caps measuring {{convert|4|<U+2013>|8|cm|in|abbr=on}} wide and stipe up to {{convert|6|cm|in|abbr=on|}} long by {{convert|2|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick. Compared to ''R.&nbsp;virescens'', it tends to be more bluish-green, the patches on its cap are larger, and it has a lined cap margin. Microscopically, the terminal cells in the cap cuticle of ''R.&nbsp;parvovirescens'' are more swollen than those of ''R.&nbsp;virescens'', which has tapered and elongated terminal cells.<ref name="Buyck 2006"/> Another green-capped ''Russula'' is ''[[Russula aeruginea|R.&nbsp;aeruginea]]'', but this species may be distinguished from ''R.&nbsp;virescens'' by its smaller size and smooth cap.<ref name="Metzler 1992"/> Other green russulas with a smooth cap include ''[[Russula heterophylla|R.&nbsp;heterophylla]]'' and [[Russula cyanoxantha|''R.&nbsp;cyanoxantha'' var. ''peltereaui'']].<ref name="Cullington 2004"/> ''[[Russula crustosa]]'', like ''R.&nbsp;virescens'', also has an areolate cap, but the cap becomes sticky (viscid) when moist, and its color is more variable, as it may be reddish, yellowish, or brown.<ref name="Arora 1986"/><ref name="McKnight 1987"/> Also, the spore print of ''R.&nbsp;crustosa'' is a darker yellow than ''R.&nbsp;virescens''.<ref name="McKnight 1987"/> ''[[Russula redolens|R.&nbsp;redolens]]'' has a cap that is "drab-green to blue-green", but unlike ''R.&nbsp;virescens'', is smooth. ''R.&nbsp;redolens'' has an unpleasant taste and smells of [[parsley]].<ref name="Miller 2006"/>

== Edibility ==
[[File:Russula virescens 107410.jpg|thumb|right|Despite its "moldy" appearance, ''R.&nbsp;virescens'' is a good edible mushroom.]]
''Russula virescens'' is an [[edible mushroom]] considered to be one of the best of the genus ''Russula'', and is popular in Europe,<ref name="Russell 2006"/><ref name="Hinkova 1986"/><ref name="Boa 2006"/><ref name="urlRussulales News / Russula virescens"/> particularly in Spain.<ref name="Carluccio 2003"/> In an 1875 work on the uses of fungi, English [[mycology|mycologist]] [[Mordecai Cubitt Cooke]] remarked about the mushroom that "the peasants about Milan are in the habit of putting [it] over wood embers to toast, and eating [it] afterwards with a little salt."<ref name="Cooke 1875"/> The mushroom is often sold as a dried product in Asia,<ref name="Sitta 2012"/> and in China, it can be found in roadside markets.<ref name="Lincoff 2011"/> Its smell is not distinctive, but its taste has been described as mild, nutty,<ref name="urlKuo"/> fruity,<ref name="Zeitlmayr 1976"/> or even sweet.<ref name="Carluccio 2003"/> Old specimens may smell of [[herring]]s.<ref name="Zeitlmayr 1976"/> Drying the mushrooms enhances the nutty flavor. Mushrooms can be [[Saut<U+00E9>ing|saut<U+00E9>ed]] (the green color disappears with cooking), and young specimens that are prepared this way have a potato taste that pairs well with [[shallot]]s.<ref name="Kuo 2007"/> They are also fried or grilled,<ref name="Zeitlmayr 1976"/> or used raw in salads.<ref name="Schunko 2010"/>  Young specimens are pale and can be hard to identify, but the characteristic pattern of older fruit bodies makes them hard to confuse with other species. When collecting ''R.&nbsp;virescens'' for consumption, caution is of vital importance to avoid confusion with the dangerously poisonous ''[[Amanita phalloides]]'' (known as the [[death cap]]), a mushroom that can be most easily identified by its [[volva (mycology)|volva]] and [[annulus (mycology)|ring]].<ref name="Zeitlmayr 1976"/><!-- cites previous three sentences -->

The nutritional components of ''R.&nbsp;virescens'' mushrooms have been characterized. Fresh mushrooms contain about 92.5% moisture. A {{convert|100|g|oz|adj=on}} sample of dried mushroom (100&nbsp;g&nbsp;dw) has 365 [[calorie|kcal]] (1527 [[kilojoules]]). [[Carbohydrate]]s make up the bulk of the fruit bodies, comprising 62% of the dry weight; 11.1% of the carbohydrates are [[sugar]]s, the large majority of which (10.9%) is [[mannitol]]. The total [[lipid]], or crude fat, content makes up 1.85% of the dry matter of the mushroom. The proportion of [[fatty acid]]s (expressed as a percentage of total fatty acids) are 28.78% [[saturated fat|saturated]], 41.51% [[monounsaturated fat|monounsaturated]], and 29.71% [[polyunsaturated fatty acid|polyunsaturated]]. The most prevalent fatty acids include: [[palmitic acid]], 17.3% of total fatty acids; [[stearic acid]], 7.16%; [[oleic acid]], 40.27%; and [[linoleic acid]], 29.18%. Several [[biological activity|bioactive]] compounds are present in the mushroom. One hundred grams (dry weight) contains 49.3 [[microgram]]s (<U+00B5>g) of [[tocopherol]]s (20.0&nbsp;<U+00B5>g [[alpha-Tocopherol|alpha]], 21.3&nbsp;<U+00B5>g [[beta-Tocopherol|beta]], and 8.0&nbsp;<U+00B5>g [[gamma-Tocopherol|gamma]]) and 0.19 milligrams (mg) of the [[carotenoid]] pigment [[lycopene]]. There are 4.46&nbsp;g of [[organic acid]]s per 100&nbsp;g of dry mushrooms, including [[oxalic acid]] (0.78&nbsp;g), [[malic acid]] (2.71&nbsp;g), [[citric acid]] (0.55&nbsp;g), and [[fumaric acid]] (0.23&nbsp;g). Mushrooms have 22.6&nbsp;mg/100&nbsp;g&nbsp;dw of the [[phenols|phenolic]] compound [[4-hydroxybenzoic acid]], and 15.8&nbsp;mg/100&nbsp;g&nbsp;dw of [[cinnamic acid]].<ref name="Leal 2013"/>

== Habitat and distribution ==
[[File:Russula virescens 89201.jpg|thumb|right|Young mushrooms with light green coloration]]
''Russula virescens'' can be found fruiting on soil in both [[Temperate deciduous forest|deciduous forests]] and [[mixed forest]]s,<ref name="McKnight 1987"/> forming [[Ectomycorrhiza|ectomycorrhizal]] [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] relationships with a variety of trees, including oaks (''[[Quercus]]''), European beech (''[[Fagus sylvatica]]''), and aspen (''[[Populus tremula]]'').<ref name="Trappe 1962"/> Preliminary investigations suggest that the fungus also associates with at least ten species of [[Dipterocarpaceae]], an important tree family prevalent in the tropical lowland forests of [[Southeast Asia]].<ref name="Brearly 2012"/> Fruit bodies may appear singly or in groups,<ref name="Roody 2003"/> reappear in the same spots year after year, and are not common. In Europe, fruiting occurs mainly during the months of summer to early autumn.<ref name="Jordan 2004"/> A Mexican study of the seasonal occurrence of several common mushroom species in [[subtropical]] forests in [[Xalapa]] showed that the fruiting period of ''R.&nbsp;virescens'' occurred in April, before the onset of the [[Wet season|rainy season]].<ref name="Chacon 1995"/>

The distribution of ''R.&nbsp;virescens'' in North America is subject to debate, where a number of similar species such as ''[[Russula parvovirescens|R.&nbsp;parvovirescens]]'' and ''[[Russula crustosa|R.&nbsp;crustosa]]'' are also recognized.<ref name="Buyck 2006"/><ref name="urlKuo"/> One author even suggests that ''R.&nbsp;virescens'' "is strictly a European species",<ref name="urlKuo"/> citing Buyck and collaborators (2006), who say "the ''virescens''-''crustosa'' group is much more complex than suspected and embraces at least a dozen taxa in the eastern US".<ref name="Buyck 2006"/> As in Europe, ''Russula virescens'' has a widespread distribution in Asia, having been recorded from India,<ref name="Das 2002"/> Malaysia,<ref name="Watling 1998"/> Korea,<ref name="Lee 1986"/> the Philippines,<ref name="Sims 1997"/> Nepal,<ref name="Christensen 2008"/> China,<ref name="Peng 2003"/> Thailand,<ref name="H<U+00F8>iland 2008"/> and Vietnam.<ref name="Kiet 1998"/> It is also found in North Africa and Central America.<ref name="Roberts 2011"/>

==Chemistry==
''Russula virescens'' has a limited capacity to [[bioaccumulation|bioaccumulate]] the [[micronutrient]]s [[iron]], [[copper]], and [[zinc]] from the soil.  The concentration of these trace metals is slightly higher in the caps than the stipes. A {{convert|300|g|adj=on}} meal of fresh mushroom caps would supply 16% of the [[recommended daily allowance]] (RDA) of copper for an adult male or female (ages 19<U+2013>50); 16% or 7.3% of the RDA of iron for an adult male or female, respectively; and 16<U+2013>22% of the adult RDA of zinc.<ref name="Busuioc 2011"/> The mushroom is a poor bioaccumulator of the toxic [[heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metals]] [[arsenic]], [[cadmium]], [[lead]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]], and [[nickel]].<ref name="Chen 2009"/>

[[Biological activity|Biologically active]] mushroom [[polysaccharide]]s have been a frequent research topic in recent decades due to their possible stimulatory effect on [[innate immune system|innate]] and [[cell-mediated immunity|cell-mediated]] immune responses, antitumor activities, and other activities.<ref name="Wasser 2011"/> Immunostimulatory activity, [[antioxidant]] activity, [[cholesterol]]-lowering, and [[blood sugar]]-lowering effects have been detected in extracts of ''R.&nbsp;virescens'' fruit bodies, which are attributed to polysaccharides.<ref name="Badalyan 2012"/> A water-insoluble [[beta-glucan]], RVS3-II, has been isolated from the fruit bodies. [[Sulfation|Sulfated]] [[derivative (chemistry)|derivatives]] of this compound have antitumor activities against [[sarcoma]] tumor [[cell line]]s.<ref name="Sun 2009"/> RVP, a water-soluble polysaccharide present in the mushroom, is made largely of [[galactomannan]] subunits and has antioxidant activity.<ref name="Sun 2010"/>

[[Ribonuclease]]s (or RNases) are [[enzyme]]s that [[enzyme catalysis|catalyze]] the [[hydrolysis]] of [[ribonucleic acid]] (RNA), and collectively they play a critical role in many biological processes. A RNase from ''R.&nbsp;virescens'' was shown to be biochemically unique amongst seven edible mushroom species in several ways: it has a co-[[Specificity (biochemistry)#Specificity|specificity]] towards cleaving RNA at poly [[adenine|A]] and poly [[cytosine|C]], compared to the monospecific RNases of the others; it can be [[adsorption|adsorbed]] on [[column chromatography|chromatography]] columns containing [[Diethylaminoethyl cellulose|DEAE<U+2013>cellulose]] as the adsorbent; it has a [[pH]] optimum of 4.5, lower than all other species; and, it has a "distinctly different" [[N-terminal]] [[amino acid sequence]].<ref name="Wang 2003"/> The mushroom contains a unique [[laccase]] enzyme that can break down several [[dye]]s used in the laboratory and in the [[textile industry]], such as  [[bromothymol blue]], [[eriochrome black T]], [[malachite green]], and reactive brilliant blue. Laccases are being used increasingly in the textile industry as environmental biocatalysts for the treatment of dye [[wastewater]].<ref name="Zhu 2013"/>
