'''Evolution''' (or more specifically '''biological''' or '''organic evolution''') is the change over time in one or more [[heritability|inherited]] [[trait (biology)|traits]] found in [[populations]] of individuals.<ref name=Futuyma>{{cite book |last=Futuyma |first=Douglas J. |authorlink=Douglas J.

Evolution occurs when there is [[Genetic diversity|variation]] of inherited traits within a population over time.

There are four common mechanisms of evolution. The first mechanism is [[natural selection]], a process in which there is differential survival and reproduction of entities that differ in one or more inherited traits.<ref name="Futuyma" /> Selection can act at multiple levels of organization, for example differential survival and/or reproduction of organisms, populations, or gene variants.<ref name="Okasha07">{{cite book | last1=Okasha | first1=S. | year=2007 | title=Evolution and the Levels of Selection | publisher=Oxford University Press | isbn=0-19-926797-9}}</ref> A second mechanism is [[genetic drift]], a process in which there are random changes to the proportions of two or more inherited traits within a population.<ref name=berkeley>{{cite web|url=http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evosite/evo101/IIID2Genesdrift.shtml |title=Effects of Genetic Drift |accessdate=February 2011 |publisher=University of California at Berkeley}}</ref><ref name="Evolutionary Biology">{{cite book| last = Futuyma| first = Douglas | authorlink = | title = Evolutionary Biology| publisher = [[Sinauer Associates]]| series = | year = 1998 | doi = | isbn = 0-87893-189-9 | page = Glossary}}</ref> A third mechanism is biased [[mutation]], which can affect phenotypes expressed across multiple levels of organisation. Finally, the fourth mechanism is [[gene flow]], which is the incorporation of genes from one population into another. 

Evolution may in the long term lead to [[speciation]], whereby a single ancestral species splits into two or more different species. Speciation is visible in [[Anatomy|anatomical]], genetic and other [[homology (biology)|similarities]] between groups of organisms, [[Biogeography|geographical distribution]] of related species, the [[fossil record]] and the recorded genetic changes in living organisms over many generations.

The scientific study of evolution began in the mid-nineteenth century, when research into the fossil record and the diversity of living organisms convinced most scientists that species evolve.<ref name=bowler>{{cite book|last=Bowler|first=Peter J.|authorlink=Peter J.

Evolution is currently applied and studied in various areas within biology such as [[conservation biology]], [[developmental biology]], [[ecology]], [[physiology]], [[paleontology]] and [[medicine]]. Moreover, it has also made an impact on other disciplines such as [[agriculture]], [[anthropology]], [[philosophy]] and [[psychology]].  [[:Category:Evolutionary biologists|Evolutionary biologists]] document the [[Fact#Fact in science|fact]] that evolution occurs, and also develop and test [[Theory#Science|theories]] that explain its causes.

==History of evolutionary thought==
{{details|History of evolutionary thought}}
The proposal that one type of animal could descend from an animal of another type goes back to some of the first [[pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratic]] Greek philosophers, such as [[Anaximander#Origin of humankind|Anaximander]] and [[Empedocles#Cosmogony|Empedocles]]. In contrast to these [[Materialism|materialistic]] views, Plato and Aristotle understood all natural things, not only [[life|living]] things, as being in fixed natural categories ("[[Theory of forms|forms]]", "[[idealism|ideas]]", or "species"). This was part of their [[teleology|teleological]] understanding of [[Nature (philosophy)|nature]] in which all things have an intended role to play in a [[divinity|divine]] [[cosmic]] order. Variations of this idea became the standard understanding of the [[Middle Ages]]. 

In the 17th century the new [[scientific method|method]] of [[modern science]] rejected this approach, and sought explanations of natural phenomena in terms of [[laws of nature]] which were the same for all visible things, and did not need to assume any fixed natural categories, nor any divine cosmic order. But this new approach was slow to take root in the biological sciences, which became the last bastion of the concept of fixed natural types. [[John Ray]] used one of the previously more general term for fixed natural types, "species", to apply to animal and plant types, identified by the distinguishing features that perpetuate themselves each generation. These were designed by God, but showing differences caused by local conditions. The biological classification introduced by [[Carolus Linnaeus]] in 1735 also viewed species as fixed according to a divine plan. 

Other naturalists of this time speculated on evolutionary change of species over time according to natural laws. [[Maupertuis]] wrote in 1751 of natural modifications occurring during reproduction and accumulating over many generations to produce new species. [[Buffon]] suggested that species could degenerate into different organisms, and [[Erasmus Darwin]] proposed that all warm-blooded animals could have descended from a single micro-organism (or "filament"). The first fully-fledged evolutionary scheme was [[Lamarck]]'s "transmutation" theory of 1809 which envisaged spontaneous generation continually producing simple forms of life developed greater complexity in parallel lineages with an inherent progressive tendency, and that on a local level these lineages adapted to the environment by inheriting changes caused by use or disuse in parents.<ref name="Margulis91" /><ref name="Gould02">{{Cite book|last= Gould|first=S.J. |authorlink=Stephen Jay Gould |title=[[The Structure of Evolutionary Theory]] |publisher=Belknap Press ([[Harvard University Press]]) |location=Cambridge |year=2002 |isbn=0-674-00613-5}}</ref> (The latter process was later called Lamarckism.)<ref name="Margulis91">{{cite book | last1=Margulis | first1=L. | last2=Fester | first1=R. | title=Symbiosis as a source of evolutionary innovation: Speciation and morphogenesis | publisher=The MIT Press | year=1991 | pages=470 | isbn=0262132699 | url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=3sKzeiHUIUQC&pg=PA162&dq=inauthor:%22Lynn+Margulis%22+lamarck&hl=en&ei=W784TqWhE4nXiALQ-LjeDg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=inauthor%3A%22Lynn%20Margulis%22%20lamarck&f=false}}</ref><ref name= ImaginaryLamarck>{{Cite book |last =Ghiselin|first = Michael T.|authorlink=Michael Ghiselin|publication-date = September/October 1994| contribution =Nonsense in schoolbooks: 'The Imaginary Lamarck'|contribution-url =http://www.textbookleague.org/54marck.htm| title =The Textbook Letter|publisher =The Textbook League|url =http://www.textbookleague.org/|accessdate=2008-01-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last = Magner |first = Lois N. |title = A History of the Life Sciences |edition = Third |publisher = [[Marcel Dekker]], [[CRC Press]] |year = 2002 |isbn = 978-0-203-91100-6 |url = http://books.google.com/?id=YKJ6gVYbrGwC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q}}</ref><ref name="Jablonka07">{{cite journal | last1=Jablonka | first1=E. | last2=Lamb | first2=M.

The critical break of biology from the concept of fixed species is generally seen as the theory of evolution of Charles Darwin. Partly influenced by ''[[An Essay on the Principle of Population]]'' by [[Thomas Robert Malthus]], Darwin noted that population growth would lead to a "struggle for existence" where favorable variations could prevail as others perished. Each generation, many offspring fail to survive to an age of reproduction because of limited resources. This could explain the diversity of animals and plants from a common ancestry through the working of natural laws working the same for all types of thing.<ref name="Sober09">{{cite journal | last1=Sober | first1=E. | year=2009 | title=Did Darwin write the origin backwards? | journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume=106 | issue=S1 | pages=10048<U+2013>10055 | doi=10.1073/pnas.0901109106 | url=http://www.pnas.org/content/106/suppl.1/10048.full.pdf+html|bibcode = 2009PNAS..10610048S }}</ref><ref>Mayr, Ernst (2001) ''What evolution is''.

[[Thomas Henry Huxley]] applied Darwin's ideas to humans, using [[paleontology]] and [[comparative anatomy]] to provide strong evidence that humans and [[apes]] shared a common ancestry. Some were disturbed by this since it implied that humans did not have a special place in the universe.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/277746/T-H-Huxley Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica Online]</ref>

Precise mechanisms of reproductive heritability and the origin of new traits remained a mystery.

In humans, for example, [[eye colour]] is an inherited characteristic and an individual might inherit the "brown-eye trait" from one of their parents.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sturm RA, Frudakis TN |title=Eye colour: portals into pigmentation genes and ancestry |journal=Trends Genet. |volume=20 |issue=8 |pages=327<U+2013>32 |year=2004 |pmid=15262401 |doi=10.1016/j.tig.2004.06.010 |ref=harv}}</ref> Inherited traits are controlled by [[gene]]s and the complete set of genes within an organism's [[genome]] is called its [[genotype]].<ref name=Pearson_2006>{{cite journal |author=Pearson H |title=Genetics: what is a gene? |journal=Nature |volume=441 |issue=7092 |pages=398<U+2013>401 |year=2006 |pmid=16724031 |doi=10.1038/441398a |ref=harv|bibcode = 2006Natur.441..398P }}</ref>

The complete set of observable traits that make up the structure and behaviour of an organism is called its [[phenotype]]. These traits come from the interaction of its genotype with the [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Visscher PM, Hill WG, Wray NR |title=Heritability in the genomics era<U+2014>concepts and misconceptions |journal=Nat. Rev. Genet. |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=255<U+2013>66 |year=2008 |pmid=18319743 |doi=10.1038/nrg2322 |ref=harv}}</ref> As a result, many aspects of an organism's phenotype are not inherited. For example, [[sun tanning|suntanned]] skin comes from the interaction between a person's genotype and sunlight; thus, suntans are not passed on to people's children. However, some people tan more easily than others, due to differences in their genotype; a striking example are people with the inherited trait of [[albinism]], who do not tan at all and are very sensitive to [[sunburn]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Oetting WS, Brilliant MH, King RA |title=The clinical spectrum of albinism in humans |journal=Molecular medicine today |volume=2 |issue=8 |pages=330<U+2013>5 |year=1996 |pmid=8796918 |doi=10.1016/1357-4310(96)81798-9 |ref=harv}}</ref>

Heritable traits are known to be passed from one generation to the next via [[DNA]], a [[molecule]] that encodes genetic information.<ref name=Pearson_2006/> DNA is a long [[polymer]] composed of four types of bases. The sequence of bases along a particular DNA molecule specify the genetic information, in a manner similar to a sequence of letters spelling out a sentence. Before a cell divides, the DNA is copied, so that each of the resulting two cells will inherit the DNA sequence. Portions of a DNA molecule that specify a single functional unit are called [[gene]]s; different genes have different sequences of bases. Within [[cell (biology)|cells]], the long strands of DNA form condensed structures called [[chromosome]]s. The specific location of a DNA sequence within a chromosome is known as a [[locus (genetics)|locus]]. If the DNA sequence at a locus varies between individuals, the different forms of this sequence are called [[allele]]s. DNA sequences can change through [[mutation]]s, producing new alleles. If a mutation occurs within a gene, the new allele may affect the trait that the gene controls, altering the phenotype of the organism.<ref name="Futuyma" />

However, while this simple correspondence between an allele and a trait works in some cases, most traits are more complex and are controlled by [[quantitative trait locus|multiple interacting genes]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Phillips PC |title=Epistasis<U+2014>the essential role of gene interactions in the structure and evolution of genetic systems |journal=Nat.

Recent findings have confirmed important examples of heritable changes that cannot be explained by direct agency of the DNA molecule. These phenomena are classed as [[epigenetic]] inheritance systems that are causally or independently evolving over genes. Research into modes and mechanisms of epigenetic inheritance is still in its scientific infancy, however, this area of research has attracted much recent activity as it broadens the scope of heritability and [[current research in evolutionary biology|evolutionary biology]] in general.<ref name="Jablonk09">{{cite journal|last1=Jablonka|first1=E.|last2=Raz|first2=G.|title=Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance: Prevalence, mechanisms and implications for the study of heredity and evolution.|journal=The Quarterly Review of Biology|volume=84|issue=2|pages=131<U+2013>176|year=2009|url=http://compgen.unc.edu/wiki/images/d/df/JablonkaQtrRevBio2009.pdf|pmid=19606595|doi=10.1086/598822}}</ref> [[DNA methylation]] marking [[chromatin]], self-sustaining metabolic loops, gene silencing by [[RNA interference]] and the three dimensional [[Protein structure|conformation]] of proteins (such as [[prions]]) are areas where epigenetic inheritance systems have been discovered at the organismic level.<ref name="Bossdorf10">{{cite journal|last1=Bossdorf|first1=O.|last2=Arcuri|first2=D.|last3=Richards|first3=C.

For example, ecological inheritance through the process of [[niche construction]] is defined by the regular and repeated activities of organisms in their environment.

==Variation==

{{See|Genetic diversity|Population genetics}}
An individual organism's [[phenotype]] results from both its [[genotype]] and the influence from the [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]] it has lived in. A substantial part of the variation in phenotypes in a population is caused by the differences between their genotypes.<ref name=Lin/> The [[modern evolutionary synthesis]] defines evolution as the change over time in this genetic variation. The frequency of one particular allele will become more or less prevalent relative to other forms of that gene. Variation disappears when a new allele reaches the point of [[fixation (population genetics)|fixation]]&nbsp;<U+2014> when it either disappears from the population or replaces the ancestral allele entirely.<ref name=Amos>{{cite journal |author=Harwood AJ |title=Factors affecting levels of genetic diversity in natural populations |journal=Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond., B, Biol. Sci. |volume=353 |issue=1366 |pages=177<U+2013>86 |year=1998 |pmid=9533122 |pmc=1692205 |doi=10.1098/rstb.1998.0200 |last2=Harwood |first2=J |ref=harv}}</ref>

Natural selection will only cause evolution if there is enough [[genetic variation]] in a population. Before the discovery of [[Mendelian genetics]], one common hypothesis was [[blending inheritance]]. But with blending inheritance, genetic variance would be rapidly lost, making evolution by natural selection implausible. The ''[[Hardy-Weinberg principle]]'' provides the solution to how variation is maintained in a population with [[Mendelian inheritance]]. According to this principle, the frequencies of alleles (variations in a gene) in a sufficiently large population will remain constant if the only forces acting on that population are the random reshuffling of alleles during the formation of the sperm or egg and the random combination of the alleles in these sex cells during [[fertilisation]].<ref name="Ewens W.J. 2004">{{cite book |author=Ewens W.J. |year=2004 |title=Mathematical Population Genetics (2nd Edition) |publisher=Springer-Verlag, New York |isbn=0-387-20191-2}}</ref>

Variation comes from [[mutation]]s in [[genetic material]], reshuffling of genes through [[sexual reproduction]] and migration between populations ([[gene flow]]). Variation also comes from exchanges of genes between different species; for example, through [[horizontal gene transfer]] in [[bacteria]] and [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridisation]] in plants.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Draghi J, Turner P |title=DNA secretion and gene-level selection in bacteria |journal=Microbiology (Reading, Engl.) |volume=152 |issue=Pt 9 |pages=2683<U+2013>8 |year=2006 |pmid=16946263 |doi=10.1099/mic.0.29013-0 |ref=harv}}<br />*{{cite journal |author=Mallet J |title=Hybrid speciation |journal=Nature |volume=446 |issue=7133 |pages=279<U+2013>83 |year=2007 |pmid=17361174 |doi=10.1038/nature05706 |ref=harv|bibcode = 2007Natur.446..279M }}</ref> Despite the constant introduction of variation through these processes, most of the [[genome]] of a species is identical in all individuals of that species.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Butlin RK, Tregenza T |title=Levels of genetic polymorphism: marker loci versus quantitative traits |journal=Philos.

===Mutation===
{{See|Mutation|Molecular evolution}}
[[File:Gene-duplication.svg|thumb|100px|right|Duplication of part of a [[chromosome]].]]
Random mutations constantly occur in the genomes of organisms, which produces genetic variation in a population. Mutations are changes in the DNA sequence of a cell's genome, which can be caused by [[Radioactive decay|radiation]], [[virus]]es, [[transposon]]s and [[mutagen|mutagenic chemicals]], as well as errors that occur during [[meiosis]] or [[DNA replication]].<ref name=Bertram>{{cite journal |author=Bertram J |title=The molecular biology of cancer |journal=Mol.

New genes can be created from an ancestral gene when a duplicate copy mutates and acquires a new function.

===Sex and recombination===
{{See|Sexual reproduction|Genetic recombination|Evolution of sexual reproduction}}
[[Image:Sexual cycle.svg|thumb|250px|right|In the first stage of sexual reproduction, "meiosis," the number of chromosomes is reduced from a diploid number (2n) to a haploid number (n).

In asexual organisms, genes are inherited together, or ''linked'', as they cannot mix with genes of other organisms during reproduction. In contrast, the offspring of [[sex]]ual organisms contain random mixtures of their parents' chromosomes that are produced through [[independent assortment]]. In a related process called [[homologous recombination]], sexual organisms exchange DNA between two matching chromosomes.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Radding C |title=Homologous pairing and strand exchange in genetic recombination |journal=Annu.

Recombination allows even alleles that are close together in a strand of DNA to become separated. However, the rate of recombination is low (approximately two events per chromosome per generation). As a result, genes close together on a chromosome may not always be shuffled away from each other and genes that are close together tend to be inherited together, a phenomenon known as [[genetic linkage|linkage]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lien S, Szyda J, Schechinger B, Rappold G, Arnheim N |title=Evidence for heterogeneity in recombination in the human pseudoautosomal region: high resolution analysis by sperm typing and radiation-hybrid mapping |journal=Am.

{{See|Gene flow}}

[[Gene flow]] is the exchange of genes between populations and between species.<ref name="Morjan C, Rieseberg L 2004 1341<U+2013>56">{{cite journal |author=Morjan C, Rieseberg L |title=How species evolve collectively: implications of gene flow and selection for the spread of advantageous alleles |journal=Mol.

[[Gene flow]] can be caused by the movement of individuals between separate populations of organisms, as might be caused by the movement of mice between inland and coastal populations, or the movement of [[pollen]] between heavy metal tolerant and heavy metal sensitive populations of grasses. 

Gene transfer between species includes the formation of [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] organisms and [[horizontal gene transfer]]. [[Horizontal gene transfer]] is the transfer of genetic material from one organism to another organism that is not its offspring; this is most common among [[bacteria]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Boucher Y, Douady CJ, Papke RT, Walsh DA, Boudreau ME, Nesbo CL, Case RJ, Doolittle WF |title=Lateral gene transfer and the origins of prokaryotic groups |doi=10.1146/annurev.genet.37.050503.084247 |journal=Annu Rev Genet |volume=37 |issue=1 |pages=283<U+2013>328 |year=2003 |pmid=14616063 |ref=harv}}</ref> In medicine, this contributes to the spread of [[antibiotic resistance]], as when one bacteria acquires resistance genes it can rapidly transfer them to other species.<ref name=GeneticEvolution>{{cite journal |author=Walsh T |title=Combinatorial genetic evolution of multiresistance |journal=Curr.

==Mechanisms==
[[File:Mutation and selection diagram.svg|thumb|right|300px|[[Mutation]] followed by [[natural selection]], creating a population with darker colouration.]]
From a [[Neo-Darwinian]] perspective, evolution occurs when there are changes in the frequencies of alleles within a population of interbreeding organisms.<ref name="Ewens W.J. 2004"/>  For example, the allele for black colour in a population of moths becoming more common. Mechanisms that can lead to changes in allele frequencies include [[natural selection]], [[genetic drift]], [[mutation]] and [[gene flow]].

===Natural selection===
{{See|Natural selection|Fitness (biology)}}
Evolution by means of [[natural selection]] is the process by which genetic mutations that enhance reproduction become and remain, more common in successive generations of a population. It has often been called a "self-evident" mechanism because it necessarily follows from three simple facts:
*Heritable variation exists within populations of organisms.
*Organisms produce more offspring than can survive.
*These offspring vary in their ability to survive and reproduce.

These conditions produce competition between organisms for survival and reproduction. Consequently, organisms with traits that give them an advantage over their competitors pass these advantageous traits on, while traits that do not confer an advantage are not passed on to the next generation.<ref name=Hurst>{{cite journal |author=Hurst LD |title=Fundamental concepts in genetics: genetics and the understanding of selection |journal=Nat. Rev. Genet. |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=83<U+2013>93 |year=2009 |pmid=19119264 |doi=10.1038/nrg2506 |ref=harv}}</ref>

The central concept of natural selection is the [[fitness (biology)|evolutionary fitness]] of an organism.<ref name=Orr>{{cite journal |author=Orr HA |title=Fitness and its role in evolutionary genetics |journal=Nat. Rev. Genet. |volume=10 |issue=8 |pages=531<U+2013>9 |year=2009 |pmid=19546856 |doi=10.1038/nrg2603 |pmc=2753274 |ref=harv}}</ref> Fitness is measured by an organism's ability to survive and reproduce, which determines the size of its genetic contribution to the next generation.<ref name=Orr/> However, fitness is not the same as the total number of offspring: instead fitness is indicated by the proportion of subsequent generations that carry an organism's genes.<ref name=Haldane>{{cite journal |author=Haldane J |title=The theory of natural selection today |journal=Nature |volume=183 |issue=4663 |pages=710<U+2013>3 |year=1959 |pmid=13644170|doi=10.1038/183710a0 |ref=harv|bibcode = 1959Natur.183..710H }}</ref> For example, if an organism could survive well and reproduce rapidly, but its offspring were all too small and weak to survive, this organism would make little genetic contribution to future generations and would thus have low fitness.<ref name=Orr/>

If an allele increases fitness more than the other alleles of that gene, then with each generation this allele will become more common within the population. These traits are said to be "selected ''for''". Examples of traits that can increase fitness are enhanced survival and increased [[fecundity]]. Conversely, the lower fitness caused by having a less beneficial or deleterious allele results in this allele becoming rarer&nbsp;<U+2014> they are "selected ''against''".<ref name="Lande">{{cite journal |author=Lande R, Arnold SJ |year=1983 |title=The measurement of selection on correlated characters |journal=Evolution |volume=37 |pages=1210<U+2013>26|doi=10.2307/2408842 |issue=6 |ref=harv |jstor=2408842}}</ref> Importantly, the fitness of an allele is not a fixed characteristic; if the environment changes, previously neutral or harmful traits may become beneficial and previously beneficial traits become harmful.<ref name="Futuyma"/> However, even if the direction of selection does reverse in this way, traits that were lost in the past may not re-evolve in an identical form (see [[Dollo's law]]).<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1558-5646.2008.00505.x | pmid = 18764918 | volume = 62 | issue = 11 | pages = 2727<U+2013>2741 | last = Goldberg | first = Emma E | title = On phylogenetic tests of irreversible evolution | journal = Evolution | year = 2008 | last2 = Igi<U+0107> | first2 = B | ref = harv}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.tree.2008.06.013 | pmid = 18814933 | volume = 23 | issue = 11 | pages = 602<U+2013>609 | last = Collin | first = Rachel | title = Reversing opinions on Dollo's Law | journal = Trends in Ecology & Evolution | year = 2008 | last2 = Miglietta | first2 = MP | ref = harv}}</ref>

[[File:Selection Types Chart.png|thumb|left|A chart showing three types of selection.
1. [[Disruptive selection]]
2. [[Stabilizing selection]]
3. [[Directional selection]]]]

Natural selection within a population for a trait that can vary across a range of values, such as height, can be categorised into three different types. The first is [[directional selection]], which is a shift in the average value of a trait over time&nbsp;<U+2014> for example, organisms slowly getting taller.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hoekstra H, Hoekstra J, Berrigan D, Vignieri S, Hoang A, Hill C, Beerli P, Kingsolver J |title=Strength and tempo of directional selection in the wild |journal=Proc.

This would be when either short or tall organisms had an advantage, but not those of medium height. Finally, in [[stabilizing selection]] there is selection against extreme trait values on both ends, which causes a decrease in [[variance]] around the average value and less diversity.<ref name=Hurst/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Felsenstein |title=Excursions along the Interface between Disruptive and Stabilizing Selection |journal=Genetics |volume=93 |issue=3 |pages=773<U+2013>95 |date=1 November 1979|pmid=17248980 |pmc=1214112 |ref=harv}}</ref> This would, for example, cause organisms to slowly become all the same height.

A special case of natural selection is [[sexual selection]], which is selection for any trait that increases mating success by increasing the attractiveness of an organism to potential mates.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Andersson M, Simmons L |title=Sexual selection and mate choice |journal=Trends Ecol.

Natural selection most generally makes nature the measure against which individuals and individual traits, are more or less likely to survive. "Nature" in this sense refers to an [[ecosystem]], that is, a system in which organisms interact with every other element, [[abiotic|physical]] as well as [[biotic component|biological]], in their local [[environment (biophysical)|environment]]. Eugene Odum, a founder of ecology, defined an ecosystem as: "Any unit that includes all of the organisms...in a given area interacting with the physical environment so that a flow of energy leads to clearly defined trophic structure, biotic diversity and material cycles (ie: exchange of materials between living and nonliving parts) within the system."<ref name="Odum1971">Odum, EP (1971) Fundamentals of ecology, third edition, Saunders New York</ref> Each population within an ecosystem occupies a distinct [[Ecological niche|niche]], or position, with distinct relationships to other parts of the system. These relationships involve the life history of the organism, its position in the [[food chain]] and its geographic range. This broad understanding of nature enables scientists to delineate specific forces which, together, comprise natural selection.

An active area of research is the [[unit of selection]], with natural selection being proposed to work at the level of genes, cells, individual organisms, groups of organisms and species.<ref name=Gould>{{cite journal |author=Gould SJ |title=Gulliver's further travels: the necessity and difficulty of a hierarchical theory of selection |journal=Philos.

===Genetic drift===
{{See|Genetic drift|Effective population size}}
[[File:Allele-frequency.png|thumb|Simulation of [[genetic drift]] of 20 unlinked alleles in populations of 10 (top) and 100 (bottom). Drift to [[Fixation (population genetics)|fixation]] is more rapid in the smaller population.]]
Genetic drift is the change in [[allele frequency]] from one generation to the next that occurs because of the role that chance plays in determining whether a given individual will survive and reproduce. In mathematical terms, alleles are subject to [[sampling error]]. As a result, when selective forces are absent or relatively weak, allele frequencies tend to "drift" upward or downward randomly (in a [[random walk]]). This drift halts when an allele eventually becomes [[Fixation (population genetics)|fixed]], either by disappearing from the population, or replacing the other alleles entirely. Genetic drift may therefore eliminate some alleles from a population due to chance alone. Even in the absence of selective forces, genetic drift can cause two separate populations that began with the same genetic structure to drift apart into two divergent populations with different sets of alleles.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lande R |title=Fisherian and Wrightian theories of speciation |journal=Genome |volume=31 |issue=1 |pages=221<U+2013>7 |year=1989 |pmid=2687093 |ref=harv}}</ref>

===Gene flow===
{{See|Gene flow|Hybrid (biology)|Horizontal gene transfer}}
[[Gene flow]] is the exchange of genes between populations and between species.<ref name="Morjan C, Rieseberg L 2004 1341<U+2013>56"/> The presence or absence of gene flow fundamentally changes the course of evolution. Due to the complexity of organisms, any two completely isolated populations will eventually evolve genetic incompatibilities through neutral processes, as in the [[Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller Model|Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller model]], even if both populations remain essentially identical in terms of their adaptation to the environment.

If genetic differentiation between populations develops, gene flow between populations can introduce traits or alleles which are disadvantageous in the local population and this may lead to organism within these populations to evolve mechanisms that prevent mating with genetically distant populations, eventually resulting in the creation of new species. Thus, exchange of genetic information between individuals is fundamentally important for creating the biological concept of [[species]]. 

During the development of the modern synthesis, [[Sewall Wright]]'s developed his [[shifting balance theory]] that gene flow between partially isolated populations was an important aspect of adaptive evolution.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Wright | first1 = Sewall | year = 1932 | title = The roles of mutation, inbreeding, crossbreeding and selection in evolution | url = http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/ridley/classictexts/wright.asp | journal = Proc. 6th Int. Cong. Genet | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 356<U+2013>366 }}</ref>  However, recently there has been substantial criticism of the importance of the [[shifting balance theory]].<ref name="Coyne 1997">{{cite journal|last=Coyne|coauthors=Barton, Turelli|title=Perspective: A Critique of Sewall Wright's Shifting Balance Theory of Evolution|journal=Evolution|year=1997|volume=51|series=3|pages=643<U+2013>671}}</ref>

==Outcomes==
Evolution influences every aspect of the form and behaviour of organisms. Most prominent are the specific behavioural and physical [[adaptation]]s that are the outcome of natural selection. These adaptations increase fitness by aiding activities such as finding food, avoiding predators or attracting mates. Organisms can also respond to selection by [[Co-operation (evolution)|co-operating]] with each other, usually by aiding their relatives or engaging in mutually beneficial [[symbiosis]]. In the longer term, evolution produces new species through splitting ancestral populations of organisms into new groups that cannot or will not interbreed.

These outcomes of evolution are sometimes divided into [[macroevolution]], which is evolution that occurs at or above the level of species, such as [[extinction]] and [[speciation]] and [[microevolution]], which is smaller evolutionary changes, such as adaptations, within a species or population.<ref name=ScottEC>{{cite journal |author=Scott EC, Matzke NJ |title=Biological design in science classrooms |series=104 |journal=Proc.

For instance, a large amount of variation among individuals allows a species to rapidly adapt to new habitats, lessening the chance of it going extinct, while a wide geographic range increases the chance of speciation, by making it more likely that part of the population will become isolated. In this sense, microevolution and macroevolution might involve selection at different levels&nbsp;<U+2013> with microevolution acting on genes and organisms, versus macroevolutionary processes such as [[species selection]] acting on entire species and affecting their rates of speciation and extinction.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gould|2002|pp= 657<U+2013>8}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Gould SJ |title=Tempo and mode in the macroevolutionary reconstruction of Darwinism |journal=Proc.

===Adaptation===
{{details|Adaptation}}
Adaptation is the process that makes organisms better suited to their [[habitat]].<ref>Mayr, Ernst 1982. ''The growth of biological thought''. Harvard. p483: "Adaptation... could no longer be considered a static condition, a product of a creative past and became instead a continuing dynamic process."</ref><ref>The ''Oxford Dictionary of Science'' defines ''adaptation'' as "Any change in the structure or functioning of an organism that makes it better suited to its environment".</ref> Also, the term adaptation may refer to a [[Trait (biology)|trait]] that is important for an organism's survival. For example, the adaptation of horses' teeth to the grinding of grass. By using the term ''adaptation'' for the evolutionary process and ''adaptive trait'' for the product (the bodily part or function), the two senses of the word may be distinguished. Adaptations are produced by [[natural selection]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Orr H |title=The genetic theory of adaptation: a brief history |journal=Nat. Rev.

Adaptation may cause either the gain of a new feature, or the loss of an ancestral feature. An example that shows both types of change is bacterial adaptation to [[antibiotic]] selection, with genetic changes causing [[antibiotic resistance]] by both modifying the target of the drug, or increasing the activity of transporters that pump the drug out of the cell.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Nakajima A, Sugimoto Y, Yoneyama H, Nakae T |title=High-level fluoroquinolone resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa due to interplay of the MexAB-OprM efflux pump and the DNA gyrase mutation |journal=Microbiol.

Adaptation occurs through the gradual modification of existing structures. Consequently, structures with similar internal organisation may have different functions in related organisms. This is the result of a single [[homology (biology)|ancestral structure]] being adapted to function in different ways.

Interactions between organisms can produce both conflict and co-operation. When the interaction is between pairs of species, such as a [[pathogen]] and a [[host (biology)|host]], or a [[Predation|predator]] and its prey, these species can develop matched sets of adaptations. Here, the evolution of one species causes adaptations in a second species. These changes in the second species then, in turn, cause new adaptations in the first species. This cycle of selection and response is called [[co-evolution]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wade MJ |title=The co-evolutionary genetics of ecological communities |journal=Nat. Rev.

Coalitions between organisms of the same species have also evolved. An extreme case is the [[eusociality]] found in [[Eusociality|social insects]], such as [[bee]]s, [[termite]]s and [[ant]]s, where sterile insects feed and guard the small number of organisms in a [[Colony (biology)|colony]] that are able to reproduce. On an even smaller scale, the [[somatic cell]]s that make up the body of an animal limit their reproduction so they can maintain a stable organism, which then supports a small number of the animal's [[germ cell]]s to produce offspring. Here, somatic cells respond to specific signals that instruct them whether to grow, remain as they are, or die. If cells ignore these signals and multiply inappropriately, their uncontrolled growth [[carcinogenesis|causes cancer]].<ref name=Bertram/>

Such cooperation within species may have evolved through the process of [[kin selection]], which is where one organism acts to help raise a relative's offspring.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Reeve HK, H<U+00F6>lldobler B |title=The emergence of a superorganism through intergroup competition |doi= 10.1073/pnas.0703466104 |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. |volume=104 |issue=23 |pages=9736<U+2013>40 |year=2007 |pmid=17517608 |pmc=1887545 |ref=harv|bibcode = 2007PNAS..104.9736R }}</ref> This activity is selected for because if the ''helping'' individual contains alleles which promote the helping activity, it is likely that its kin will ''also'' contain these alleles and thus those alleles will be passed on.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Axelrod R, Hamilton W |title=The evolution of cooperation |journal=Science |volume=211 |issue=4489 |pages=1390<U+2013>6|year = 2005 |pmid=7466396 |doi=10.1126/science.7466396 |ref=harv|bibcode = 1981Sci...211.1390A }}</ref> Other processes that may promote cooperation include [[group selection]], where cooperation provides benefits to a group of organisms.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wilson EO, H<U+00F6>lldobler B |title=Eusociality: origin and consequences |doi= 10.1073/pnas.0505858102 |journal=Proc.

[[reproductive isolation|Barriers to reproduction]] between two diverging populations are required for the populations to [[speciation|become new species]]. Gene flow may slow this process by spreading the new genetic variants also to the other populations.

The second mechanism of speciation is [[peripatric speciation]], which occurs when small populations of organisms become isolated in a new environment. This differs from allopatric speciation in that the isolated populations are numerically much smaller than the parental population. Here, the [[founder effect]] causes rapid speciation through both rapid genetic drift and selection on a small gene pool.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Templeton AR |title=The theory of speciation via the founder principle |url=http://www.genetics.org/cgi/reprint/94/4/1011 |journal=Genetics |volume=94 |issue=4 |pages=1011<U+2013>38 |date=1 April 1980|pmid=6777243 |pmc=1214177 |ref=harv}}</ref>

The third mechanism of speciation is [[parapatric speciation]]. This is similar to peripatric speciation in that a small population enters a new habitat, but differs in that there is no physical separation between these two populations. Instead, speciation results from the evolution of mechanisms that reduce gene flow between the two populations.<ref name=Gavrilets/> Generally this occurs when there has been a drastic change in the environment within the parental species' habitat.

One type of sympatric speciation involves cross-breeding of two related species to produce a new [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] species. This is not common in animals as animal hybrids are usually sterile. This is because during [[meiosis]] the [[homologous chromosome]]s from each parent are from different species and cannot successfully pair.

Speciation events are important in the theory of [[punctuated equilibrium]], which accounts for the pattern in the fossil record of short "bursts" of evolution interspersed with relatively long periods of stasis, where species remain relatively unchanged.<ref name=pe1972>Niles Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould, 1972.

Press. 1985</ref> In this theory, speciation and rapid evolution are linked, with natural selection and genetic drift acting most strongly on organisms undergoing speciation in novel habitats or small populations. As a result, the periods of stasis in the fossil record correspond to the parental population and the organisms undergoing speciation and rapid evolution are found in small populations or geographically restricted habitats and therefore rarely being preserved as fossils.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gould SJ |title=Tempo and mode in the macroevolutionary reconstruction of Darwinism |doi= 10.1073/pnas.91.15.6764 |journal=Proc.

Soon after the emergence of these first multicellular organisms, a remarkable amount of biological diversity appeared over approximately 10 million years, in an event called the [[Cambrian explosion]].

==Applications==
{{See|Applications of evolution|Artificial selection|Evolutionary computation}}

Concepts and models used in evolutionary biology, in particular natural selection, have many applications.<ref name=Bull>{{cite journal |author=Bull JJ, Wichman HA |title=Applied evolution |journal=Annu Rev Ecol Syst |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages=183<U+2013>217 |year=2001 |doi=10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.32.081501.114020 |ref=harv}}</ref>

[[Artificial selection]] is the intentional selection of traits in a population of organisms. This has been used for thousands of years in the [[domestication]] of plants and animals.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Doebley JF, Gaut BS, Smith BD |title=The molecular genetics of crop domestication |journal=Cell |volume=127 |issue=7 |pages=1309<U+2013>21 |year=2006 |pmid=17190597 |doi=10.1016/j.cell.2006.12.006 |ref=harv}}</ref> More recently, such selection has become a vital part of [[genetic engineering]], with [[selectable marker]]s such as antibiotic resistance genes being used to manipulate DNA. In repeated rounds of mutation and selection proteins with valuable properties have evolved, for example modified [[enzyme]]s and new [[antibody|antibodies]], in a process called [[directed evolution]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=J<U+00E4>ckel C, Kast P, Hilvert D |title=Protein design by directed evolution |journal=Annu Rev Biophys |volume=37 |issue=1 |pages=153<U+2013>73 |year=2008 |pmid=18573077 |doi=10.1146/annurev.biophys.37.032807.125832 |ref=harv}}</ref>

In the 19th century, particularly after the publication of ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' in 1859, the idea that life had evolved was an active source of academic debate centred on the philosophical, social and religious implications of evolution.

The teaching of evolution in American secondary school biology classes was uncommon in most of the first half of the 20th century. The [[Scopes Trial]] decision of 1925 caused the subject to become very rare in American secondary biology textbooks for a generation, but it was gradually re-introduced about a generation later and legally protected with the 1968 ''[[Epperson v. Arkansas]]'' decision. Since then, the competing religious belief of [[creationism]] was legally disallowed in secondary school curricula in various decisions in the 1970s and 1980s, but it returned in the form of [[intelligent design]], to be excluded once again in the 2005 ''[[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]]'' case.<ref>[http://www.bioone.org/doi/full/10.1641/B570313 Understanding Creationism after Kitzmiller] 2007</ref>
