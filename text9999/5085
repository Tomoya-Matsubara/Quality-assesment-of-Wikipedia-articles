'''HMS ''Manly''''' was a 12-gun {{sclass|Bold|gun-brig}} of the [[Royal Navy]] launched in 1812. She served in the [[War of 1812]], her boats participating in the [[Battle of Lake Borgne]]. She was sold in 1833.

==Active service==
Commissioned initially under Commander Edward Collier,<ref name=Winfield>Winfield (2008), p.345.</ref> she left [[Deal, Kent|Deal]] on 27 December 1812 and sailed to the [[Scheldt River|Scheldt]].<ref name=Byrne/> On 23 March 1813, ''Manly'' sailed to the Americas.<ref name="NMM-WH-370891">

In the summer of 1813 ''Manly'' captured the ship ''Flor de Jago'', of 164 tons, sailing from Lisbon to Boston. Then on 2 August she captured the brig ''Hope'', sailing from Batavia to Providence.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=16837|startpage=20|date=1 January 1814}}</ref> ''Manly'' was stranded at [[City of Halifax|Halifax]] on 13 November 1813 but was salved after incessant labor over three weeks.<ref name=Byrne>O'Byrne (1849), Vol. 1, p.215</ref>  

In early January 1814, Collier and his crew volunteered to reinforce the squadron on the Great Lakes, together with men from [[HMS Fantome (1810)|''Fantome'']] and [[HMS Thistle (1812)|''Thistle'']]. Seventy men left Halifax; they reached [[Kingston, Ontario]] on 22 March, having traveled some 900 miles in winter, almost entirely on foot.<ref>''Naval Chronicle'', Vol. 33, pp.123-7.</ref> 

After Collier left, Lieutenant Vincent Newton took command of ''Manly''.<ref name=Winfield/> In May he was promoted to Commander, but remained with her. In August 1814 she joined Captain Gordon of {{HMS|Seahorse|1794|2}} and his small squadron. The squadron, without ''Manly'' destroyed shipping on the [[Potomac River|Potomac]] on 17 August. They then sailed up the Potomac to bombard Fort Washington while Vice-Admiral [[Alexander Cochrane]] landed the army at [[Benedict, Maryland]] on the [[Patuxent River]] on 19 and 20 August. 

On 20 August the 40-gun [[fourth rate]] [[Endymion class frigate|''Endymion''-class frigate]] {{HMS|Severn|1813|2}}, the [[sailing frigate|frigate]] {{HMS|Hebrus|1813|2}} and ''Manly'' sailed up the [[Patuxent River]] to follow the boats as far as possible.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=16939|startpage=1939|endpage=1941|date=27 September 1814}}</ref> Cochrane and his force of marines and seamen entered [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] on the night of 24 August. The British then burnt the [[White House]], the Treasury and the War Office. They left at 9 o'clock in the evening of the next day and returned to [[Nottingham, Maryland]] on the Patuxent where Cochrane boarded ''Manly''. The campaign cost the Navy one man killed and six wounded, including one man of the [[Corps of Colonial Marines]] killed and three wounded.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=16939|startpage=1942|endpage=1943|date=27 September 1814}}</ref>{{#tag:ref|Prize-money arising from the booty captured by the expedition in the River Patuxent, at Fort Washington, and Alexandria, between 22 and 29 August 1814 was paid in November 1817.

==Battle of Lake Borgne==
Commander Henry Montresor took command after Manly was sent to the Gulf of Mexico. In early December 1814, a British fleet massed for the assault on [[Battle of New Orleans|New Orleans]]. Between 12 and 15 December 1814, Captain Nicholas Lockyer of [[HMS Sophie (1809)|HMS ''Sophie'']] led a flotilla of some 50 boats, barges, gigs and launches to attack the US gunboats.<ref name=LG16991>{{London Gazette|issue=16991|startpage=446|endpage=449|date=9 March 1815}}</ref>  He drew his flotilla from the fleet that was massing against New Orleans, including the 74-gun [[third-rate]] [[HMS Tonnant (1798)|''Tonnant'']], ''Arminde'', ''Seahorse'', ''Manly'', and [[HMS Starr (1805)|''Meteor'']]. Lockyer deployed the boats in three divisions, of which he led one. Commander Montresor of the ''Manly'' commanded the second, and Captain Samuel Roberts of ''Meteor'' commanded the third. After rowing for 36 hours, the British met the Americans at St. Joseph's Island. On the morning of the 14th, the British engaged the Americans in the short, violent [[Battle of Lake Borgne]]. The British destroyed the one-gun schooner [[USS Sea Horse (1812)|USS ''Sea Horse'']], and captured almost the entire American force, including the tender, [[USS Alligator (1813)|USS ''Alligator'']], and five gunboats. The British lost 17 men killed and 77 wounded; ''Manly'' fortunately had no casualties.<ref name=LG16991/> {{HMS|Anaconda|1813|2}} then evacuated the wounded.<ref name=LG16991/> 

Lockyer was promoted to [[Post Captain]] on 29 March 1815, and Montresor and Roberts were promoted to [[post captain]] on 13 June. Montresor was also nominated as a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] on 4 June.<ref>Brenton (1823), pp. 189-191.</ref> In 1821 the survivors of the flotilla shared in the distribution of head-money arising from the capture of the American gun-boats and sundry bales of cotton.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=17719|date=26 June 1821|startpage=1353|endpage=1354}}</ref>{{#tag:ref| A first-class share of the prize money was worth <U+00A3>34 12[[Shilling|s]] 9<U+00BC>[[pence|d]]; a sixth-class share, that of an ordinary seaman, was worth 7s 10<U+00BE>d.<ref>{{London Gazette|startpage=1561|issue=17730|date=28 July 1821}}</ref>|group=Note}} In 1847 the Admiralty issued a clasp (or bar) for the Naval General Service Medal marked "14 Dec. Boat Service 1814" to survivors of the battle that wanted to claim it.

After Montresor received his promotion to post-captain, Commander George Truscott took command of ''Manly'' in early 1815.  Following the peace, ''Manly'' landed Mr Williamson of {{HMS|Albion|1802|2}}, the purveyor of the squadron, at [[Savannah, Georgia]] in April to buy provisions. He found that trade had reverted to normal.<ref>''Naval Chronicle'', Vol. 33, p.430.</ref> ''Manly'' later sailed from [[Wilmington, North Carolina]] to Bermuda and then back home. Commander Charles Simione replaced Truscott in June 1815.<ref name=Winfield/>

==Post-war career==
In February 1824 she was fitted with iron and zinc on the bottom "for an experiment to preserve the copper".<ref name=Winfield/> 

''Manly'' was [[reserve fleet|in ordinary]] (reserve) in Portsmouth in 1826, and then fitted for sea between October 1826 and May 1827. She was recommissioned in February 1827 under Lieutenant William Field for the Halifax station.<ref name=Winfield/> 

She remained on the Halifax station into the early 1830s. In June 1928 Lieutenant H. W. Bishop assumed command. His replacement in October 1830 was Lieutenant John Wheatley.<ref name=Winfield/>

==Fate==
''Manly'' was sold out of the service in 1833 to Sturge for <U+20A4>550.<ref name=Winfield/>
