'''Titania''' is the largest [[natural satellite|moon]] of [[Uranus]] and the [[List of natural satellites by diameter|eighth largest moon]] in the [[Solar System]]. Discovered by [[William Herschel]] in 1787, Titania is named after the [[Titania|queen of the fairies]] in Shakespeare's ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]''. Its orbit lies inside Uranus' [[magnetosphere]].

Titania consists of approximately equal amounts of ice and [[rock (geology)|rock]], and is likely differentiated into a rocky [[core (geology)|core]] and an icy [[mantle (geology)|mantle]]. A layer of liquid water may be present at the [[Core<U+2013>mantle boundary|core<U+2013>mantle boundary]]. The surface of Titania, which is relatively dark and slightly red in color, appears to have been shaped by both impacts and [[endogenic]] processes. It is covered by numerous [[impact crater]]s reaching 326&nbsp;km in diameter, but is less heavily cratered than the surface of Uranus' outermost moon, [[Oberon (moon)|Oberon]]. Titania probably underwent an early endogenic resurfacing event that obliterated its older, heavily cratered surface. Titania's surface is cut by a system of enormous [[canyon]]s and [[Fault scarp|scarps]]; the result of the expansion of its interior during its later evolution. Like all moons of Uranus, Titania probably formed from an [[accretion disk]] that surrounded the planet just after its formation.

[[Infrared]] spectroscopy conducted from 2001 to 2005 revealed the presence of water [[ice]] as well as [[carbon dioxide]] on the surface of Titania, which in turn suggested that the moon may possess a tenuous carbon dioxide [[atmosphere]] with a surface pressure of about one 10 trillionth of a [[bar (unit)|bar]]. Measurements during Titania's occultation of a [[star]] put an upper limit on the surface pressure of any possible atmosphere at 10<U+2013>20&nbsp;[[bar (unit)|nbar]].

As of 2009, the Uranian system has been studied up close only once: by the spacecraft ''[[Voyager 2]]'' in January 1986. It took several images of Titania, which allowed mapping of about 40% of the moon<U+2019>s surface.

==Discovery and naming==
Titania was discovered by [[William Herschel]] on January 11, 1787, the same day he discovered Uranus' second largest moon, [[Oberon (moon)|Oberon]].<ref name=Herschel1/><ref name=Herschel2/> He later reported the discoveries of four more satellites,<ref name=Herschel3/> although they were subsequently revealed as spurious.<ref name=Struve1848/> For nearly fifty years following their discovery, Titania and Oberon would not be observed by any instrument other than William Herschel's,<ref name=Herschel4/> although the moon can be seen from [[Earth]] with a present-day  high-end amateur telescope.<ref name=Newton/>

All of Uranus' moons are named after characters created by [[William Shakespeare]] or [[Alexander Pope]]. The name Titania was taken from [[Titania (Fairy Queen)|the Queen of the Fairies]] in ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]''.<ref name=Kuiper1949/> The names of all four satellites of Uranus then known were suggested by Herschel's son [[John Herschel|John]] in 1852, at the request of [[William Lassell]],<ref name=Lassell5/> who had discovered the other two moons, [[Ariel (moon)|Ariel]] and [[Umbriel (moon)|Umbriel]], the year before.<ref name=Lassell1851/>

Titania was initially referred to as "the first satellite of Uranus", and in 1848 was given the designation '''{{nowrap|Uranus I}}''' by William Lassell,<ref name=Lassell2/> although he sometimes used William Herschel's numbering (where Titania and Oberon are II and IV).<ref name=Lassell3/> In 1851 Lassell eventually numbered all four known satellites in order of their distance from the planet by [[Roman numerals]], and since then Titania has been designated '''{{nowrap|Uranus III}}'''.<ref name=Lassell1851b/>

Shakespeare's character's name is {{pron-en|t<U+0268><U+02C8>t<U+0251><U+02D0>nj<U+0259>}}, but the moon is often pronounced {{IPA|/ta<U+026A><U+02C8>te<U+026A>ni<U+0259>/}}, by analogy with the familiar chemical element [[titanium]].<ref name=Webster/> The adjectival form, ''Titanian,'' is homonymous with that of Saturn's moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]].

==Orbit==
Titania orbits Uranus at the distance of about 436,000&nbsp;km, being the second farthest from the planet among its five major moons.{{#tag:ref|The five major moons are [[Miranda (moon)|Miranda]], [[Ariel (moon)|Ariel]], [[Umbriel (moon)|Umbriel]], Titania and Oberon.|group=note}} Titania's orbit has a small [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] and is [[orbital inclination|inclined]] very little relative to the [[equator]] of Uranus.<ref name=orbit/> Its [[orbital period]] is around 8.7&nbsp;days, coincident with its [[rotational period]]. In other words, Titania is a [[synchronous orbit|synchronous]] or [[tidally locked]] satellite, with one face always pointing toward the planet.<ref name=Smith1986/>

Titania's orbit lies completely inside the Uranian [[magnetosphere]].<ref name=Grundy2006/> This is important, because the trailing hemispheres of satellites orbiting inside a magnetosphere are struck by magnetospheric plasma, which co-rotates with the planet.<ref name=Ness1986/> This bombardment may lead to the darkening of the trailing hemispheres, which is actually observed for all Uranian moons except Oberon (see below).<ref name=Grundy2006/>

Because Uranus orbits the Sun almost on its side, and its moons orbit in the planet's equatorial plane, they (including Titania) are subject to an extreme seasonal cycle. Both northern and southern [[Sphere#Hemisphere|hemispheres]] spend 42 years in a complete darkness, and another 42 years in continuous sunlight.<ref name=Grundy2006/> Once every 42 years, when Uranus has an [[equinox]] and its equatorial plane intersects the Earth, mutual [[occultation]]s of Uranus' moons become possible. In 2007<U+2013>2008 a number of such events were observed including two occultations of Titania by Umbriel on August 15 and December 8, 2007.<ref name=occultations/>

==Composition and internal structure==
[[File:PIA00039 Titania.jpg|thumb|left|This ''[[Voyager 2]]'' image of Titania shows enormous rifts.|alt=A round spherical body with its left half illuminated. The surface has a mottled appearance with bright patches among relatively dark terrain. The terminator is slightly to the right from the center and runs from the top to bottom. A large crater with a central pit can be seen at the terminator in the upper half of the image. Another bright crater can be seen at the bottom intersected by a canyon. The second large canyon runs from the darkness at the lower-right side to visible center of the body.]]

Titania is the largest and most massive of Uranian moons, and the eighth most massive moon in the Solar System.{{#tag:ref|The seven moons more massive than Titania are [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]], [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], [[Callisto (moon)|Callisto]], [[Io (moon)|Io]], Earth's [[Moon]], [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], and [[Triton (moon)|Triton]].<ref name=JPLSSD/>|group=note}} Its density of 1.71&nbsp;g/cm<sup>3</sup>,<ref name=Jacobson1992/> which is much higher than the typical density of Saturn's satellites, indicates that it consists of roughly equal proportions of water ice and dense non-ice components;<ref name=Hassmann2006/> the latter could include [[rock (geology)|rock]] and heavy [[organic compound]]s.<ref name=Smith1986/> The presence of water ice is supported by [[infrared]] [[spectroscopic]] observations made in 2001<U+2013>2005, which have revealed [[crystalline]] water ice on the surface of the moon.<ref name=Grundy2006/> Water ice [[absorption band]]s are stronger on Titania's leading hemisphere than on the trailing hemisphere. This is the opposite of what is observed on Oberon, where the trailing hemisphere exhibits stronger water ice signatures.<ref name=Grundy2006/> The cause of this asymmetry is not known, but it may be related to the bombardment by charged particles from the [[magnetosphere of Uranus]], which is stronger on the trailing hemisphere (due to the plasma's co-rotation).<ref name=Grundy2006/> Energetic particles [[sputtering|sputter]] water ice and decompose organics, leaving a dark, carbon-rich material behind.<ref name=Grundy2006/>

Except for water, the only other compound identified on the surface of Titania by infrared spectroscopy is [[carbon dioxide]], which is concentrated mainly on the trailing hemisphere.<ref name=Grundy2006/> Other plausible candidates for the dark surface materials include rock, various [[salt]]s and organic compounds.<ref name=Smith1986/> The origin of the carbon dioxide is not completely clear. It might be produced locally from [[carbonate]]s or organic materials under the influence of the solar [[ultraviolet]] radiation or energetic charged particles coming from the magnetosphere of Uranus. The latter process would explain the asymmetry in its distribution, because the trailing hemisphere is subject to a more intense magnetospheric influence than the leading hemisphere. Another possible source is the [[outgassing]] of the [[primordial elements|primordial]] CO<sub>2</sub> trapped by water ice in the Titania's interior. The escape of CO<sub>2</sub> from the interior may be related to the past geological activity on this moon.<ref name=Grundy2006/>

Titania may be differentiated into a rocky [[core (geology)|core]] surrounded by an icy [[mantle (geology)|mantle]].<ref name=Hassmann2006/> If this is the case, the radius of the core (520&nbsp;km) is about 66% of the radius of the moon, and its mass is around 58% of the moon<U+2019>s mass<U+2014>the parameters are dictated by moon's composition. The pressure in the center of Titania is about 0.58&nbsp;[[GPa]] (5.8&nbsp;[[kbar]]).<ref name=Hassmann2006/> The current state of the icy mantle is unclear. If the ice contains enough ammonia or other [[antifreeze]], Titania may possess a liquid ocean layer at the core-mantle boundary. The thickness of this ocean, if it exists, is up to 50&nbsp;km and its temperature is around 190&nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]].<ref name=Hassmann2006/> However the present internal structure of Titania depends heavily on its thermal history, which is poorly known.

Among Uranus' moons, Titania is intermediate in brightness between the dark Oberon and Umbriel and the bright Ariel and [[Miranda (moon)|Miranda]].<ref name=Karkoschka2001a/> Titania's surface shows a strong [[opposition surge]]: its reflectivity decreases from 35% at a phase angle of 0<U+00B0> ([[albedo|geometrical albedo]]) to 25% at an angle of about 1<U+00B0>. Titania has a relatively low [[bond albedo]] of about 17%.<ref name=Karkoschka2001a/> Its surface is generally slightly red in color.<ref name=Bell1991/> However, fresh impact deposits are bluer, while the smooth plains situated on the leading hemisphere near [[Ursula (crater)|Ursula crater]] and along some grabens are redder.<ref name=Plescia1987/> There may be an asymmetry between the leading and trailing hemispheres;<ref name=Buratti1991/> the former appears to be redder than the latter by 8%.{{#tag:ref|The color is determined by the ratio of albedos viewed through the green (0.52<U+2013>0.59&nbsp;<U+03BC>m) and violet (0.38<U+2013>0.45&nbsp;<U+03BC>m) Voyager filters.<ref name=Bell1991/><ref name=Buratti1991/>|group=note}} However, this difference is related to the smooth plains and may be accidental.<ref name=Bell1991/> The reddening of the surfaces probably results from [[space weathering]] caused by bombardment by charged particles and [[micrometeorites]] over the age of the [[Solar System]].<ref name=Bell1991/>

Scientists have recognized three classes of geological feature on Titania: [[Impact crater|craters]], [[chasm]]ata ([[canyon]]s) and [[rupes]] ([[escarpment|scarps]]).<ref name=usgs/> The surface of Titania is less heavily cratered than the surfaces of either Oberon or Umbriel, which means that it is much younger.<ref name=Plescia1987/> The crater diameters range from a few kilometers at the low end to 326&nbsp;kilometers for the largest known crater,<ref name=Plescia1987/> [[Gertrude (crater)|Gertrude]].<ref name=usgsGertrude/> Some craters (for instance, [[Ursula (crater)|Ursula]] and [[Jessica (crater)|Jessica]]) are surrounded by bright impact ejecta ([[rayed crater|rays]]) consisting of relatively fresh ice.<ref name=Smith1986/> All large craters on Titania have flat floors and central peaks. The only exception is Ursula, which has a pit in the center.<ref name=Plescia1987/> To the west of Gertrude there is an area with irregular topography, the so-called "unnamed basin", which may be another highly degraded impact basin with the diameter of about 330&nbsp;km.<ref name=Plescia1987/>

Titania's surface is intersected by a system of enormous [[normal fault|faults]], or scarps. In some places, two parallel scarps mark depressions in the satellite's crust,<ref name=Smith1986/> forming [[graben]]s, which are sometimes called canyons.<ref name=Croft1989/> The most prominent among Titania's canyons is [[Messina Chasma]], which runs for about 1500&nbsp;km from the equator almost to the south pole.<ref name=usgs/> The grabens on Titania are 20<U+2013>50&nbsp;km wide and have a relief of about 2<U+2013>5&nbsp;km.<ref name=Smith1986/> The scarps that are not related to canyons are called rupes, such as [[Rousillon Rupes]] near Ursula crater.<ref name=usgs/> The regions along some scarps and near Ursula appear smooth at ''Voyager''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> image resolution. These smooth plains were probably resurfaced later in Titania's geological history, after the majority of craters formed. The resurfacing may have been either endogenic in nature, involving the eruption of fluid material from the interior ([[cryovolcanism]]), or, alternatively it may be due to blanking by the impact ejecta from nearby large craters.<ref name=Plescia1987/> The grabens are probably the youngest geological features on Titania<U+2014>they cut all craters and even smooth plains.<ref name=Croft1989/>

The geology of Titania was influenced by two competing forces: [[impact crater]] formation and endogenic resurfacing.<ref name=Croft1989/> The former acted over the moon's entire history and influenced all surfaces. The latter processes were also global in nature, but active mainly for a period following the moon's formation.<ref name=Plescia1987/> They obliterated the original heavily cratered terrain, explaining the relatively low number of impact craters on the moon's present-day surface.<ref name=Smith1986/> Additional episodes of resurfacing may have occurred later and led to the formation of smooth plains.<ref name=Smith1986/> Alternatively smooth plains may be ejecta blankets of the nearby impact craters.<ref name=Croft1989/> The most recent endogenous processes were mainly [[tectonic]] in nature and caused the formation of the canyons, which are actually giant cracks in the ice crust.<ref name=Croft1989/> The cracking of the crust was caused by the global expansion of Titania by about 0.7%.<ref name=Croft1989/>

==Atmosphere==
The presence of carbon dioxide on the surface suggests that Titania may have a tenuous seasonal atmosphere of CO<sub>2</sub>, much like that of the Jovian moon [[Atmosphere of Callisto|Callisto]].{{#tag:ref|The partial pressure of CO<sub>2</sub> on the surface of Callisto is about 10&nbsp;pbar.|group=note}}<ref name=Widemann2009/> Other gases like [[nitrogen]] or [[methane]] are unlikely to be present, because the moon's weak gravity could not prevent them escaping into the space. At the maximum temperature attainable during Titania's [[summer solstice]] (89&nbsp;K), the [[vapor pressure]] of carbon dioxide is about 3&nbsp;nbar.<ref name=Widemann2009/>

On September 8, 2001, Titania [[occultation|occulted]] a bright star ([[HIP106829]]) with a [[Apparent magnitude|visible magnitude]] of 7.2; this was an opportunity to both refine the moon's diameter and [[ephemeris]], and to detect any extant atmosphere. The data revealed no atmosphere to a surface pressure of 10<U+2013>20 nanobars; if it exists, it would have to be far thinner than that of [[Triton (moon)|Triton]] or [[Pluto]].<ref name=Widemann2009/> This upper limit is still several times higher than the maximum possible surface pressure of the carbon dioxide, meaning that the measurements place essentially no constraints on parameters of the atmosphere.<ref name=Widemann2009/>

The peculiar geometry of the Uranian system causes the moons' poles to receive more [[solar energy]] than their equatorial regions.<ref name=Grundy2006/> Since the vapor pressure of CO<sub>2</sub> is a steep function of temperature,<ref name=Widemann2009/> this may lead to the accumulation of carbon dioxide in the low-latitude regions of Titania, where it can stably exist on high albedo patches and shaded regions of the surface in the form of ice. During the summer, when the polar temperatures reach as high as 85<U+2013>90&nbsp;K,<ref name=Widemann2009/><ref name=Grundy2006/> carbon dioxide sublimates and migrates to the opposite pole and to the equatorial regions, giving rise to a type of [[carbon cycle]]. The accumulated carbon dioxide ice can be removed from cold traps by magnetospheric particles, which sputter it from the surface. Titania is thought to have lost a significant amount of carbon dioxide since its formation 4.6&nbsp;billion years ago.<ref name=Grundy2006/>

==Origin and evolution==
Titania is thought to have formed from an [[accretion disc]] or subnebula; a disc of gas and dust that either existed around Uranus for some time after its formation or was created by the giant impact that most likely gave Uranus its large [[obliquity]].<ref name=Mousis2004/> The precise composition of the subnebula is not known; however, the relatively high density of Titania and other Uranian moons compared to the [[moons of Saturn]] indicates that it may have been relatively water-poor.{{#tag:ref|For instance, [[Tethys (moon)|Tethys]], a Saturnian moon, has the density of 0.97&nbsp;g/cm<sup>3</sup>, which implies it contains more than 90% of water.<ref name=Grundy2006/>|group=note}}<ref name=Smith1986/> Significant amounts of [[nitrogen]] and [[carbon]] may have been present in the form of [[carbon monoxide]] and N<sub>2</sub> instead of [[ammonia]] and [[methane]].<ref name=Mousis2004/> The moons that formed in such a subnebula would contain less water ice (with CO and N<sub>2</sub> trapped as a [[clathrate]]) and more rock, explaining the higher density.<ref name=Smith1986/>

Titania's accretion probably lasted for several thousand years.<ref name=Mousis2004/> The impacts that accompanied accretion caused heating of the moon's outer layer.<ref name=Squyres1988/> The maximum temperature of around 250&nbsp;K was reached at the depth of about 60&nbsp;km.<ref name=Squyres1988/> After the end of formation, the subsurface layer cooled, while the interior of Titania heated due to decay of [[radioactivity|radioactive elements]] present in its rocks.<ref name=Smith1986/> The cooling near-surface layer contracted, while the interior expanded. This caused strong [[extensional stress]]es in the moon's crust leading to cracking. Some of present-day canyons may be a result of this process, which lasted for about 200&nbsp;million years,<ref name=Hillier1991/> implying that any endogenous activity ceased billions years ago.<ref name=Smith1986/>

The initial [[accretion (astrophysics)|accretional heating]] together with continued decay of radioactive elements were probably strong enough to melt the ice if some antifreeze like ammonia (in the form of [[hydrate|ammonia hydrate]]) was present.<ref name=Squyres1988/> Further melting may have led to the separation of ice from rocks and formation of a rocky core surrounded by an icy mantle. A layer of liquid water (ocean) rich in dissolved ammonia may have formed at the core<U+2013>mantle boundary.<ref name=Hassmann2006/> The [[eutectic temperature]] of this mixture is 176&nbsp;K.<ref name=Hassmann2006/> If the temperature dropped below this value the ocean would have frozen by now. The freezing of the water led to the expansion of the interior, which may have been responsible for the formation of the majority of canyons.<ref name=Plescia1987/> <!-- Still, the present knowledge of the evolution of Titania is quite limited.-->

==Exploration==
{{main|Exploration of Uranus}}
So far the only close-up images of Titania have been from the ''[[Voyager 2]]'' probe, which photographed the moon during its flyby of Uranus in January 1986. Since the closest distance between ''Voyager&nbsp;2'' and Titania was only 365,200&nbsp;km,<ref name=Stone1987/> the best images of this moon have a spatial resolution of about 3.4&nbsp;km (only Miranda and Ariel were imaged with a better resolution).<ref name=Plescia1987/> The images cover about 40% of the surface, but only 24% was photographed with the precision required for [[geological mapping]]. At the time of the flyby, the southern hemisphere of Titania (like those of the other moons) was pointed towards the [[Sun]], so the northern (dark) hemisphere could not be studied.<ref name=Smith1986/> No other spacecraft ever visited Uranus (and Titania), and no mission to this planet is planned in the foreseeable future.
