'''Robert Hues''' (1553 <U+2013> 24 May 1632) was an English [[mathematician]] and [[geographer]]. He graduated from [[St Mary Hall, Oxford|St. Mary Hall]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], in 1578 and may have travelled to [[Continental Europe]] thereafter. Hues became interested in [[geography]] and [[mathematics]], and made observations of the [[magnetic declination|variations of the compass]] off the coast of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]]. He either went there on a fishing trip, or joined a 1585 voyage to [[Virginia]] arranged by [[Walter Raleigh]] and led by [[Richard Grenville]] which passed Newfoundland on the return journey to England. Between 1586 and 1588, Hues travelled with [[Thomas Cavendish]] on a [[circumnavigation]] of the globe, taking the opportunity to measure [[latitudes]]. In 1589, Hues went on the [[George Clifford, 3rd Earl of Cumberland|Earl of Cumberland]]'s raiding expedition to the [[Azores]] to capture Spanish [[galleon]]s. Beginning in August 1591, Hues travelled with Cavendish again, intending to complete another circumnavigation of the globe. They were accompanied by [[John Davis (English explorer)|John Davis]]. During the voyage, while in the [[Atlantic Ocean|South Atlantic]] Hues made [[astronomy|astronomical]] observations, and also observed the variation of the compass there and at the [[Equator]]. Cavendish died on the journey in 1592, and Hues returned to England with Davis in 1593.

In 1594, Hues published his discoveries in the [[Latin]] work ''Tractatus de globis et eorum usu'' (''Treatise on Globes and their Use'') which was written to explain the use of the terrestrial and celestial globes that had been made and published by [[Emery Molyneux]] in late 1592 or early 1593, and to encourage English sailors to use practical astronomical navigation. Hues' work subsequently went into at least 12 other printings in Dutch (1597, 1613 and 1622), English (1638 and 1659), French (1618) and Latin (1611, 1613, 1617, 1627, 1659 and 1663).

Hues continued to have dealings with Raleigh in the 1590s, and later became a servant of [[Thomas Grey, 15th Baron Grey de Wilton|Thomas Grey]], the 15th and last [[Baron Grey de Wilton]]. While Grey was imprisoned in the [[Tower of London]] for participating in the [[Bye Plot]], Hues stayed with him. Following Grey's death in 1614, Hues attended upon [[Henry Percy, 9th Earl of Northumberland|Henry Percy, the 9th Earl of Northumberland]], when he was confined in the Tower; one source states that Hues, [[Thomas Harriot]] and [[Walter Warner]] were Northumberland's constant companions and known as his "Three [[Magi]]", though this is disputed. Hues tutored Northumberland's sons [[Algernon Percy, 10th Earl of Northumberland|Algernon Percy]], who subsequently became the 10th [[Earl of Northumberland]], at Oxford; and later Algernon's younger brother Henry in 1622<U+2013>1623. In later years, Hues lived in [[Oxford]] where he was a fellow of the University, and discussed mathematics and allied subjects with like-minded friends. He died on 24 May 1632 in the city and was buried in [[Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford|Christ Church Cathedral]].

Hues was a friend of the [[geographer]] [[Richard Hakluyt]], who was then regent master of [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]]. In the 1580s, Hakluyt introduced him to [[Walter Raleigh]] and [[exploration|explorers]] and [[navigator]]s whom Raleigh knew.

Hues became interested in [[geography]] and [[mathematics]] <U+2013> an undated source indicates that he disputed accepted values of [[magnetic declination|variations of the compass]] after making observations off the [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] coast. He either went there on a fishing trip, or may have joined a 1585 voyage to [[Virginia]] arranged by Raleigh and led by [[Richard Grenville]], which passed Newfoundland on the return journey to England. Hues perhaps become acquainted with the sailor [[Thomas Cavendish]] at this time, as both of them were taught by Harriot at Raleigh's school of navigation. An anonymous 17th-century manuscript states that Hues [[circumnavigation|circumnavigated]] the world with Cavendish between 1586 and 1588 "purposely for taking the true [[Latitude]]<!--Capitalization in the source.--> of places";<ref>[[Manuscript|MS]] Rawl.

''Tractatus de globis'' begins with a letter by Hues dedicated to Raleigh that recalled geographical discoveries made by Englishmen during Elizabeth I's reign.
