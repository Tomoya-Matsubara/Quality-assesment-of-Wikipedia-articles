'''Tory Christman''' (formerly '''Tory Bezazian''') is a prominent [[United States|American]] critic of [[Scientology]] and former member of the organization. Originally brought up to believe in [[Catholicism]], Christman turned to [[Scientology]] after being introduced to the book ''[[Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health]]'' authored by Scientology founder [[L. Ron Hubbard]] while staying with her parents in [[Chicago, Illinois]]. She identified with concepts described in the book including the idea of attaining the Scientology state of [[Clear (Scientology)|clear]], and became a member of the organization in 1969. She [[hitchhike]]d from Chicago to [[Los Angeles, California]] in order to begin the process of studying Scientology, and initially felt that it helped improve her life. In 1972, she joined the elite division within Scientology called the [[Sea Org]]. After being a member of the Scientology organization for ten years, Christman reached the spiritual [[Operating Thetan]] level of OT III, and learned the story of [[Xenu]]. She subsequently rose to a higher Operating Thetan level of OT VII, the second-highest within the organization. Her medical condition of [[epilepsy]] caused difficulty while in Scientology, as the organization did not approve of taking medication in order to manage her condition.

She became an [[ordained]] [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]] within Scientology, and instructed celebrity member actor [[John Travolta]] in initial coursework. Christman worked in multiple Scientology staff capacities, including for its drug rehab organization [[Narconon]], and at one of the organization's [[Celebrity Centres]]. After serving in these roles, Christman came to work for the [[Office of Special Affairs]] (OSA), which functions as an [[intelligence agency]] within Scientology. She participated in multiple missions for OSA, including a 1979 operation designed to advance the organization's interests in [[Clearwater, Florida]], and a 1985 operation assisting OSA agents during a lawsuit against Scientology. In 1999, OSA agents removed the [[censorship]] software "[[Scieno Sitter]]" from Christman's home computer, in order to allow her to carry out a mission of monitoring critical material about Scientology on the [[Internet]]. It was in this capacity that she came across the Scientology critic website [[Operation Clambake]], managed by [[Andreas Heldal-Lund]].

Christman reported directly to OSA vice president, Janet Weiland, about her efforts to remove criticism of Scientology from the media and online. She supervised the Scientology Parishioners League, a group dedicated to removing criticism about the organization from the press, media, and Internet. After an operation viewed as successful where Christman complained to [[MTV]] about a ''[[South Park]]'' parody involving Travolta and characters from the comedy series which satirized Scientology, she was assigned in 2000 to monitor postings to the [[newsgroup]] ''[[alt.religion.scientology]]''. Christman took the [[screen name]] of "Magoo", and posted multiple times to the newsgroup in attempts to stifle criticism. This conflicted with her ideals of [[freedom of speech]], and after Andreas Heldal-Lund reached out to her by [[email]], she subsequently decided to leave Scientology.

After leaving Scientology, Christman's family and friends in the movement ceased communication with her, under the organization's policy of [[disconnection]]. She traveled to [[Florida]] to join members of the [[Lisa McPherson Trust]], a group dedicated to protesting against Scientology. For leaving Scientology and joining with a critic group, she felt she was subjected to the Scientology policy of "[[Fair Game (Scientology)|Fair Game]]"; a form of retribution for criticizing the organization. Christman has since become one of the more prominent critics of Scientology; she lectures and gives interviews about the organization internationally. In 2008 she joined in protests organized by the movement against Scientology called [[Project Chanology]] started by the Internet-based group [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]], but criticized the group for some of their initial illegal acts. Christman maintains an account on [[YouTube]] with the identification "ToryMagoo44", where she posts topically about Scientology. ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' characterized Christman in a 2009 article as "a fierce critic of the church".<ref name="indenial" />

==Early life==
Christman was born in 1947; she is the daughter of [[Paul Christman]],<ref name="walker1969" /> an [[American football]] player and member of the [[College Football Hall of Fame]] who played [[college football]] for the [[University of Missouri]] and professionally for the [[Arizona Cardinals|Chicago Cardinals]] and [[Green Bay Packers]].<ref>[[#College2010|College Football 2010]]</ref><ref>[[#ProFootball2010|Pro-Football 2010]]</ref> Christman was brought up to believe in [[Catholicism]].<ref name="sommer">[[#Sommer2005|Sommer 2005]]</ref> In 1969 at age 22, Christman went through a difficult period abusing [[heroin]] in [[San Francisco, California]].<ref name="ortega" /> Christman had left home for [[California]] with the intent of becoming a [[hippie]].<ref name="ortega" /> She required medical treatment after using a dirty [[hypodermic needle]], and returned to her parents' residence in [[Chicago, Illinois]].<ref name="ortega" /> While recuperating in [[Illinois]] after a stay at [[Lake Forest Hospital]],<ref name="walker1969">[[#Walker1969|Walker 1969]]</ref> two Scientologist friends persuaded her to join the Scientology organization.<ref name="ortega" /> 

She read the foundational text ''[[Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health]]'' by Scientology founder, [[science fiction]] writer [[L. Ron Hubbard]], and came to believe "it was a solution for helping other people".<ref name="debunking">[[#Kozlowski2005|Kozlowski 2005]]</ref> In recalling her initial thoughts upon reading the book by Hubbard, Christman commented, "I was really looking for a higher state of consciousness and a way of helping people. And I read ''Dianetics'' and I felt "WOW this is it!" You know, "I can help people go [[Clear (Scientology)|CLEAR]]."<ref name="areweclear" /> She [[hitchhike]]d from Chicago to [[Los Angeles, California]] to study Scientology in 1969.<ref name="areweclear">[[#Gersztyn2002|Gersztyn 2002]]</ref> Her first course in Scientology cost [[United States dollar|US$]]35.00.<ref name="trussel" /> Christman was quoted with a positive comment about Scientology, in the 1992 edition of the [[Church of Scientology International]]-produced book ''What is Scientology?''.<ref name="whatis">[[#Scientology1992|Scientology 1992]]</ref> She stated in the book, "I find life just gets better and better."<ref name="whatis" /> Christman has a son.<ref>[[#Tisdall1993|Tisdall 1993]]</ref>

==Scientology==
===Rise within organization===
In 1972, Christman joined the division of Scientology called the [[Sea Org]],<ref name="areweclear" /> an elite unit within the organization.<ref name="debatte">[[#Ternieden2009|Ternieden 2009]]</ref><ref>[[#Morton2008|Morton 2008]], p. 125</ref> ''[[3 News]]'' characterised the Sea Org as "Scientology's senior management".<ref name="davies">[[#Davies2009|Davies 2009]]</ref> In their book ''Cults and New Religions'', [[Douglas E. Cowan]] and [[David G. Bromley]] describe the Sea Org writing, "Described by the Church as 'a fraternal religious order,' members of the Sea Org 'occupy the most essential and trusted positions in the senior churches in the Scientology hierarchy'."<ref name="cowan">[[#Cowan2007|Cowan 2007]], p. 39</ref> ''Rolling Stone'' notes, "Sea Org members staff all of the senior ecclesiastic positions in the church hierarchy".<ref name="reitman" /><ref name="best" /> In 2010, there were 5,000 members in the Sea Org.<ref>[[#Collerton2010|Collerton 2010]]</ref> After being a member of the Scientology organization for ten years, Christman reached the spiritual "[[Operating Thetan]]" level of OT III.<ref name="reitman">[[#Reitman2006|Reitman 2006]]</ref><ref name="best">[[#Best2007|ASME 2007]], pp. 317, 333</ref> She recounted her experience of reading the [[Xenu]] story upon reaching the level of OT III: "You've jumped through all these hoops just to get to it, and then you open that packet, and the first thing you think is, 'Come on.'"<ref name="best" /> She explained, "You're surrounded by all these people who're going, 'Wow, isn't it amazing, just getting the data? I can tell it's really changed you.' After a while, enough people say it and you're like, 'Wow. You know, I really feel it.'"<ref name="best" /> 

While a member of the organization, Christman rose to the Operating Thetan level of OT VII, "the near-pinnacle of enlightenment",<ref name="reitman" /><ref name="best" /> and second-highest level within the movement.<ref name="ortega" /><ref name="areweclear" /> She worked for a time in one of the organization's [[Celebrity Centres]],<ref name="masters">[[#Masters2005|Masters 2005]]</ref> and became acquainted with celebrity members including [[John Travolta]] and [[Kelly Preston]].<ref name="price">[[#Price2010|Price 2010]]</ref> She became an [[ordained]] minister within Scientology, and in this role trained new recruits to the organization, including Travolta.<ref name="areweclear" /> She trained Travolta on the "Hubbard Qualified Scientologist", the second Scientology class after the initial communication course.<ref name="areweclear" /> Christman spent time working at [[Narconon|Narconon International]],<ref>[[#Humanist2004|Humanist 2004]]</ref> a group affiliated with Scientology and promoted as a drug rehabilitation program using methods created by L. Ron Hubbard.<ref name="scientologylink">[[#Asimov2004|Asimov 2004]]</ref> She later came to realize that Narconon was a recruitment arm for Scientology, "Narconon's orders come from the Church of Scientology's senior management. Their programs, policies -- it's all church policy. There's no question about this to anyone involved. ... At Narconon (they're) handling drugs in society. But in truth, it's to 'safe point the environment' &ndash; a goodwill gesture so they can recruit people."<ref name="scientologylink" />

According to ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', Christman became a "high-ranking Scientologist" during her time in Scientology.<ref name="reitman" /><ref name="best" /> She had difficulty progressing higher than OT VII within the organization, in part due to her medical condition of [[epilepsy]].<ref name="ortega" /> She was instructed to cease taking prescribed medication for her epilepsy, and as a result experienced multiple serious [[seizure]]s.<ref name="ortega" /><ref>[[#Morton2008|Morton 2008]], p. 306</ref> In one instance two of her front teeth came out after she suffered a fall caused by a seizure while in the bathroom.<ref name="indenial" /> She recounted these incidents of [[grand mal seizure|seizures]], in an interview with ''[[CBS News]]'', "So I started having grand mal seizures, and I wasn't even off the medicine. I was only off part of the medicine, and I started having very bad grand mal seizures."<ref name="viewson">[[#CBS2009|CBS 2009]]</ref> Christman recalled that her epilepsy was not recognized as a genuine medical condition by the Scientology organization; whose practice was to instruct members to attempt self-treatment utilizing [[sauna]]s and [[vitamin]]s.<ref>[[#Brain2009|Brain 2009]]</ref>

Christman worked with the [[Office of Special Affairs]] (OSA) in her efforts to curtail or remove material critical of Scientology from the press, media, and the [[Internet]].<ref name="ortega">[[#Ortega2001|Ortega 2001]]</ref> She spent a total of 20 years working for the OSA agency while a member of the Scientology organization.<ref name="areweclear" /> OSA agents serve as the "internal security force and intelligence unit" within Scientology.<ref name="ortega" /> Christman assisted OSA agents in 1979, when a politician in [[Clearwater, Florida]] was attempting to hinder the Scientology organization's efforts to establish a presence in the city.<ref name="ortega" /> She was ordered to participate in public meetings, and divert the focus of these events to questioning of the politician, Richard Tenning.<ref name="ortega" /><ref name="areweclear" /> He was defeated in a subsequent election, and the Scientology organization proceeded to increase its activities in Clearwater.<ref name="ortega" /> In 1985, Christman helped OSA agents during a lawsuit from a former Scientology member.<ref name="ortega" /> She attended the court proceedings and wrote reports about members of the [[jury]], and assisted Scientology lawyers in compiling profiles of the jurors.<ref name="ortega" /> At the time, Christman was an ardent believer in the Scientology organization and did not question the activities of the OSA agents.<ref name="ortega" /> Reflecting back on her experiences assisting OSA agents, she commented, "I was in a cult. Scientology promotes not watching the news. It keeps you inside a ''[[The Truman Show|Truman Show]]'' where you're totally unaware of things. It's like your own thinking gets shut down and you get used to not considering anything that might be critical of Scientology."<ref name="ortega" />

In 1998, the Scientology organization publicized an initiative to hand out software on CDs to all its members, which would help them create their own websites describing their activity in the movement, and linking back to the main site at www.scientology.org.<ref name="ortega" /> The Scientology organization did not reveal to these individuals that the CD was simultaneously bundled with [[censorship]] software which blocked websites critical of the organization.<ref name="ortega" /> This censorship software was termed, "[[Scieno Sitter]]" by critics of the organization.<ref name="ortega" /> OSA agents wished for Christman to specifically monitor such critical websites and report to the organizsation about her findings, so they removed the Scieno Sitter censorship software from the computer at her residence in 1999, allowing her to research sites online freely.<ref name="ortega" /> She came across the Scientology critic website [[Operation Clambake]], managed by [[Andreas Heldal-Lund]].<ref name="ortega" />

Christman reported directly to OSA vice president, Janet Weiland, about her efforts to remove criticism of Scientology from the media and online.<ref name="ortega" /> She assisted in dealing with [[public relations]] for Scientology.<ref name="areweclear" /><ref>[[#Ortega2008|Ortega 2008]]</ref> Within the organization, negative publicity in the media was referred to as "Black PR".<ref name="areweclear" /> In 2000, Christman was in charge of the Scientology Parishioners League, a division formed by volunteers on orders from Weiland in order to respond rapidly to incidents of critical coverage of Scientology in the press.<ref name="ortega" /><ref name="areweclear" /> Weiland recruited Christman to the Scientology Parishioners League in 1999.<ref name="ortega" /> She would receive instruction from OSA agents, and proceed to complain to journalism editors and television producers in an attempt to convince them to pull a critical segment on Scientology.<ref name="ortega" /> [[A&E Network]] produced a special television program analyzing [[cult]]s, and the Scientology Parishioners League complained to the network and attempted to have Scientology removed from coverage in the program, asserting, "Scientology isn't a cult."<ref name="areweclear" />

Christman was tasked with refuting facts posted on the Internet about the organization.<ref>[[#DR2009|DR 2009]]</ref> She observed about her time working with OSA, "The guys I worked with posted every day all day. It was like a machine. I worked with someone who used five separate computers, five separate anonymous identities...to refute any facts from the internet about the Church of Scientology."<ref name="cademetz">[[#Metz2009|Metz 2009]]</ref> She acknowledged that she setup multiple identities for use in this purpose online, "I was in charge of setting up phony accounts on the Internet that were designed to shut down free speech by blocking out opponents' sites or trick-routing people to pro-Scientology sites when they were looking for opposing information."<ref name="debunking" />

[[File:2008 04 18 Tory Christman quote1.ogg|thumb|Audio of Tory Christman discussing [[Office of Special Affairs]] operations against criticism of [[Scientology]] on the [[Internet]], and her views on [[freedom of speech]] (April 2008)]]
She was assigned to try to stop the [[MTV Movie Awards]] from featuring a ''[[South Park]]'' [[satire]] which poked fun at Scientology and the film based on a book by its founder L. Ron Hubbard, titled ''[[Battlefield Earth (film)|Battlefield Earth]]''.<ref name="ortega" /> Christman repeatedly called the [[New York]] office of MTV in an attempt to get them to stop the satire from airing.<ref name="ortega" /> In the eventual broadcast, which ran June 8, 2000, the ''South Park'' character [[Cartman]] was shown using a [[Scientology personality test]] as [[toilet paper]].<ref name="ortega" /> Christman believed she had succeeded in her mission, for she thought that her efforts prevented the book ''Dianetics'' from being used by Cartman, instead of the personality test.<ref name="ortega" />

After the perceived success of her ''South Park'' assignment, OSA agents instructed Christman to deal with Scientology critics who congregated on the Internet.<ref name="ortega" /> Her initial activities focused on a [[Warner Bros.]]-operated [[bulletin board]] which focused on ''Battlefield Earth'', and she subsequently progressed to posting on the [[newsgroup]] ''[[alt.religion.scientology]]'' (ARS).<ref name="ortega" /> In 2000, ARS functioned as a community of individuals whose efforts included posting material which reflected negatively on the Scientology organization.<ref name="ortega" /> Christman took the screen name of "Magoo".<ref name="ortega" /><ref name="areweclear" /> From her [[Burbank, California]] residence in 2000, Christman posted numerous attacks on Scientology critics that were active on ARS.<ref name="ortega" /> She worked to become the most frequent poster on the newsgroup by July 2000.<ref name="ortega" /> Scientology critics on ARS were mystified as to the identity of the individual behind the Magoo handle, and posited that it was either a collective of OSA agents, or [[David Miscavige]] himself, the leader of Scientology management.<ref name="ortega" />

===Decision to leave===
[[Image:2008 03 31 Jason Beghe with Tory Mark Andreas.jpg|thumb|right|Actor [[Jason Beghe]], Tory Christman, [[Mark Bunker]], and [[Andreas Heldal-Lund]] (March 2008)]]
During this period of time in her efforts on behalf of the OSA agents, Christman felt conflicted in her activities, because she supported [[freedom of speech]] and she felt her activities constituted censorship.<ref name="ortega" /> The operator of Xenu.net, Andreas Heldal-Lund, saw Christman's posts on ARS and reached out to her via email on July 14, 2000.<ref name="ortega" /> The two engaged in communication, and Heldal-Lund explained to Christman his motivation for managing the Operation Clambake site.<ref name="ortega" /> Christman identified with Heldal-Lund's ideals of [[free speech]], and on July 20, 2000, she announced her intention to leave Scientology in a public post to ARS.<ref name="ortega" /> She realized she would face repercussions from the organization for her actions, and asked Heldal-Lund for help; he recommended she contact a group of protesters against Scientology called the [[Lisa McPherson Trust]] (LMT) who were based in [[Clearwater, Florida]].<ref name="ortega" /> The LMT was started by [[Robert Minton]] and former Scientologists to highlight the controversial death of Scientology member, [[Lisa McPherson]].<ref name="ortega" />

Through the Scientology practice of "[[disconnection]]", Christman's husband and the majority of her acquaintances and friends who were Scientologists at the time of her exit from the group were [[excommunication|excommuniated]] from her and cut off contact.<ref name="reitman" /><ref name="best" /> Christman recounted how after leaving the organization, the Church of Scientology attempted to damage her [[reputation]] through a policy referred to as "[[dead agenting]]".<ref name="reitman" /><ref name="best" /> According to Christman, the Scientology organization publicized inaccurate information about her online, tried to get her removed from her position of employment, and opened a lawsuit related to her protesting against the group on church property.<ref name="reitman" /><ref name="best" /> Then Scientology-spokesperson, [[Mike Rinder]], called her a "wacko" and rejected her assertions as "absolute bullshit".<ref name="reitman" /><ref name="best" />

Christman contacted the Scientology critics based in Clearwater, and arranged flight transportation to [[Florida]].<ref name="ortega" /><ref name="areweclear" /> She arrived at the airport in [[California]] to find that her flight was cancelled.<ref name="ortega" /> Her former supervisor, Janet Weiland, was waiting for her close to the ticket counter, and tried to convince her to remain in the organization.<ref name="ortega" /><ref name="areweclear" /> Christman eventually got on a flight to [[Tampa, Florida]], but was met at the gate when she arrived by agents of Scientology.<ref name="ortega" /><ref name="areweclear" /> Tampa police were notified, and escorted Christman safely away from the Scientologists.<ref name="ortega" /><ref name="areweclear" /> While a member of Scientology, Christman had given over $1 million to the organization; she used her inheritance money to pay for coursework.<ref name="trussel" /> She commented to the ''[[St. Petersburg Times]]'' of [[Florida]] about the thought process she underwent after leaving the organization, "When you get out and you get the whole thing, you're like, 'What was I thinking?'. I know the people inside are brainwashed and they're laughing at me. But to me, the truth is, I'm free. I can do what I want. I can say what I want."<ref>[[#O'Neil2000|O'Neil 2000]]</ref>

===Public criticism===
[[Image:Tory Christman London Protest.jpg|thumb|left|Christman at protest by [[Project Chanology]] in [[London]] (July 2008)]]
Shortly after leaving the organization, Christman began protesting in Florida against Scientology with members of the Lisa McPherson Trust.<ref name="ortega" /> She picketed with signs outside of the organization's [[Fort Harrison Hotel]] in [[Clearwater, Florida]].<ref>[[#O'Neil2001b|O'Neil 2001b]]</ref> Scientology representatives in Clearwater complained to police in November 2000 about the picketing, and Christman and Minton were fined [[United States dollar|US$]]100.<ref name="ortega" /><ref name="judgetakes" /> On February 21, 2001, Judge Thomas E. Penick dismissed other charges in the case, and criticized Scientology for its treatment of critics, commenting, "I'm missing the point here. I hope someone will let us know when the great invasion is coming."<ref name="ortega" /><ref name="judgetakes">[[#O'Neil2001|O'Neil 2001]]</ref> This experience was a defining period for Christman, as she was concerned that her former church would attempt to characterize her as a criminal.<ref name="ortega" /> She maintained that the actions by representatives of Scientology against her were examples of the policy, "[[Fair Game (Scientology)|Fair Game]]"; a form of retribution for criticizing the organization.<ref name="holland">[[#Holland2001|Holland 2001]]</ref>

In 2008, Christman was engaged in traveling around the world lecturing about Scientology and gave media interviews about the subject.<ref name="trussel">[[#Svendsen2008|Svendsen 2008]]</ref> In his 2008 book ''[[Tom Cruise: An Unauthorized Biography]]'', author [[Andrew Morton (writer)|Andrew Morton]] thanked Christman in the acknowledgements section for advising him with regard to the [[jargon]] and complicated history of Scientology.<ref>[[#Morton2008|Morton 2008]], p. 326</ref> In February 2008, Christman appeared on the [[National Public Radio]] program ''[[Morning Edition]]'' in a piece about the protest movement against Scientology called [[Project Chanology]] started by the Internet-based group [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]]; she said she objected to any illegal methods used, but appreciated new activists taking part in criticizing Scientology.<ref>[[#Masters2008|Masters 2008]]</ref> Along with Scientology critic [[Mark Bunker]], she took part in the international protests against the organization in 2008 as part of Project Chanology.<ref>[[#Heise2008b|Heise 2008b]]</ref> Christman maintains an account on [[YouTube]] with the identification "ToryMagoo44", where she posts topically about Scientology.<ref>[[#Heise2008|Heise 2008]]</ref><ref>[[#Netzeitung2008|Netzeitung 2008]]</ref> Her YouTube account was briefly shut down in April 2008 around the time period that the same thing happened to Mark Bunker; soon afterwards an unidentified individual posted to ''[[alt.religion.scientology]]'' and boasted of "silencing" Christman.<ref>[[#Metz2008|Metz 2008]]</ref> Christman resided in [[Los Angeles, California]] in 2009.<ref name="indenial">[[#Harlow2009|Harlow 2009]]</ref> ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' characterized Christman in a 2009 article as "a fierce critic of the church".<ref name="indenial" />
