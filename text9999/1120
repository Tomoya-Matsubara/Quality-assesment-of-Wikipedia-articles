'''Tom Zubrycki''' (born in London, England in 1946) is an Australian [[documentary]] filmmaker. He is "widely respected as one of Australia's leading documentary filmmakers", according to the ''The Concise Routledge Encyclopedia of the Documentary Film''.<ref name=reichert>{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ay5rIWCXlLsC&pg=PA56 |title=The Concise Routledge Encyclopedia of the Documentary Film |author=Ramon Reichert |editor=Ian Aitken |publisher=Routledge |year=2013 |page=56 |chapter=Australia |isbn= 9781136512063|accessdate=}}</ref> His films on social, environmental and political issues have won international prizes and have screened around the world.<ref>[http://aso.gov.au/people/Tom_Zubrycki/ Tom Zubrycki], [[Australian Screen Online]]</ref> He is an active member of the [[Australian Directors Guild]] and lectures in the Open Program of the [[Australian Film, Television and Radio School]].<ref name=masterclass>[http://www.open.aftrs.edu.au/course/X510 Directing Masterclass with Tom Zubrycki], Australian Film, TV and Radio School</ref>

== Personal life and activities ==

Tom Zubrycki was born in the UK. His father was [[Jerzy Zubrzycki]], a University academic credited as being one of the main architects of the Australian government<U+2019>s policy on [[Multiculturalism in Australia|multiculturalism]].<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.iofc.org/promise-diversity |title=The Promise of Diversity: The Story of Jerzy Zubrzycki, Architect of Multicultural Australia |author1=John Williams |author2=John Bond |publisher=Grosvenor Books Australia |year=2013 |accessdate=November 15, 2013}}</ref> The family migrated to Australia in 1955, where he attended St Edmunds College, Canberra ACT Australia; [[Australian National University]], Canberra; and [[University of New South Wales]], Sydney. 

Apart from making films, Zubrycki is also a teacher of documentary. Between 2003 and 2008 he lectured in documentary at [[University of Technology, Sydney]] and since 2010 he has been teaching documentary masterclasses in the Open Program of [[Australian Film, Television and Radio School]].<ref name=masterclass/> He is actively involved in the [[Australian Directors Guild]] and served for several years on the Board. He is also on the committee of Ozdox the Australian documentary film makers forum, and Screen Cafe at [[Riverside Theatre Parramatta|Riverside Theatre]] in Parramatta.

==Film making career==

After finishing a degree in Sociology,{{when}} Zubrycki entered the video access movement making short <U+2018>process<U+2019> videos using black & white [[Portapak|porta-paks]] with Sydney-based community groups and trade unions.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/arts-theatre-culture/film/australian-documentary-history-practices-and-genres |title=Australian Documentary: History, Practices and Genres |author=Trish FitzSimons |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2011 |page=79-80 |accessdate=November 15,2013}}</ref> These videos<ref>[http://aso.gov.au/titles/documentaries/we-have-to/notes/ ''We Have To Live With It''], [[Australian Screen Online]]</ref><ref>[http://aso.gov.au/titles/documentaries/fig-street-fiasco/notes/ ''Fig Street Fiasco''], [[Australian Screen Online]]</ref> made in the tradition of the Canadian [[Challenge for Change]] scheme, had a specific purpose in empowering communities and giving them a voice.<ref><U+201C>Video Politic<U+201D> in ''City Video Newsletter'' No 1, 1974</ref> The videos were shown in town halls, community centers, and peoples houses (a period before domestic video players were available). The limits of the new video technology and his desire to reach wider audiences ultimately forced Zubrycki to switch to [[16mm film]] and to feature-length documentaries. Using the networks developed making these early videos Zubrycki completed ''Waterloo'' in 1981. The film, which focused attention on the negative social impacts of Sydney's rapid urban development, won the prize for Best Documentary at the 1981 [[Sydney Film Festival]].<ref>[http://online.sffarchive.org.au/?iid=74426&startpage=page0000083#folio=83 Sydney Film Festival Award Winners]</ref>  

Zubrycki's films have a style that he has developed over the last 30 years. The subjects of his documentaries are, on the most part, drawn from issues of the day, and personalised.<ref>"On filmmaking, history and other obsessions" by Patrick Armstrong, ''[[Metro Magazine]]'', Issue 144, 2006</ref>  He usually works in a documentary or "[[Documentary_mode|observational style]]" and his films are narrative-based and character-driven. His first documentaries were stories that focused on the victims of Australia's rapid economic and social re-structuring.  They included ''Waterloo'' (1981) about the effects of urban redevelopment on a Sydney suburb; ''Kemira - Diary of a Strike'' (1984) about an underground colliery sit-in strike near [[Wollongong]]<ref>"Showing some fight: Kemira's challenge to industrial relations" by Rebecca Coyle & Lisa Milner pp 178 - 183, ''[[Metro Magazine]]'' 153, 2007</ref> which won an AFI Award for Best Documentary,<ref name=afiwinners>[http://www.afi.org.au/Content/NavigationMenu/Archive/2010Awards/2010AwardsPDF/Non-Feature_Award_Winners_1958-2010.pdf Past AFI Award Winners], [[Australian Film Institute]]</ref> and ''Friends & Enemies'' (1985) about a protracted and bitter union dispute in Queensland that saw the rise of the [[New Right (UK)|New Right]] in Australian politics.  

In 1988, he was contracted by [[Film Australia]] to write and direct a documentary commissioned by the [[Australian Council of Trade Unions]] (ACTU) and funded by The Australian Bicentennial Authority.  However, owing to editorial difference between the filmmaker and the ACTU, the film was never officially completed. Zubrycki claimed that he was forced to re-write history in accordance with the wishes of key ACTU officials who wanted to de-emphasize direct industrial action as a way of improving wages and conditions.<ref>"ACTU seeks to suppress controversial film", ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'', January 12, 1991</ref><ref>The "Amongst Equals" is a collection of articles about the film history of the Australian Trade Union movement by Ann Curhtoys and Hall Greenwood in ''Filmnews'', V.21 No.1 Feb 1991 5-7</ref> The unfinished film was screened at the [[Melbourne International Film Festival]] in 1989, and copies on [[VHS tape]] circulated in Australia.

In the late 80's, Zubrycki made two documentaries in [[Broome]], Western Australia: ''Lord of the Bush'' (1990), a bio-pic about eccentric British developer [[Alistair_McAlpine,_Baron_McAlpine_of_West_Green|Lord Alistair McAlpine]] and his plans to create a new <U+2018>civilization<U+2019> in Australia's north; and ''Bran Nue Dae'' (1991), about the first Aboriginal musical ever written and performed in Australia.  The documentary featured indigenous playwright [[Jimmy Chi]]. 

In the early 1990's, Zubrycki's focus turned to migrant and refugee families, and the stresses caused by cultural conflict, and the search for identity and home. In 1993, he completed ''Homelands'' about an El Salvadorean refugee family and the anatomy of a marriage under stress.<ref>"Film captures revolutionary<U+2019>s haunted past" about HOMELANDS in ''[[The Australian]]'', October 15, 1993.</ref> This was followed by ''Billal (1995), a documentary that followed the dramatic aftermath of a racially motivated incident involving a Lebanese teenage boy and his family.<ref>"How ethnic conflict left a young man with brain damage" by Deborah Hope. ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'', October 5 1995 </ref>

Zubrycki was employed as a Commissioning Editor at [[SBS-TV]] in 1996/97, but quickly returned to directing, making ''The Diplomat'' (2000), about former exiled [[East Timorese]] leader [[Jose Ramos-Horta]] and the final two years of his 25-year campaign to secure his homeland's independence.<ref>"Reclaiming The Personal As Political" by Mary Debrett in ''[[Metro Magazine]]'', Issue 138, 2002</ref> The film won in the 2000 [[AACTA Awards]] for Best Documentary and Best Director.<ref name=afiwinners/> ''The Concise Routledge Encyclopedia of the Documentary Film'' called it his most most successful film. <ref name=reichert/>

This was soon followed by ''The Secret Safari'' (2001), a historical documentary set in the [[Apartheid]] era about a covert operation involving a specially designed Bedford truck which used the cover of a safari tour to run weapons and munitions to [[Umkhonto we Sizwe]] operatives in the townships of Capetown and Johannesburg . This film involved re-enactment as part of the story-telling structure and was a stylistic departure.  

In 2003, he returned to Australia and made ''[[Molly & Mobarak]]'', a story about a [[Hazara]] refugee from Afghanistan who finds work in an Australian country town and falls in love with a local schoolteacher.<ref><U+201C>Stealing Moments: Tom Zubrycki<U+2019>s MOLLY & MOBARAK<U+201D> by Kate Nash, ''[[Metro Magazine]]'', Issue 165, 2011</ref><ref><U+201C>I<U+2019>m Falling in Your Love<U+2019>: Cross-cultural Romance and the Refugee Film<U+201D> by Sonia Tascon in [http://www.intellectbooks.co.uk/books/view-Book,id=4640/ ''Diasporas of Australian Cinema''] eds: Simpson, Murawska and Lambert. Intellect Press. 2009</ref> The film secured cinema release around Australia, opened the [[Margaret Mead Film Festival]] in New York in 2003, and screened in competition at [[IDFA]]. This was followed in 2005 by ''Vietnam Symphony'', about how during the[[American War]] (aka Vietnam War) the Hanoi Conservatorium of Music -  teachers and students - evacuated to a village where it continued to operate for five years. In 2007, he made ''Temple of Dreams'' about an Islamic Youth Centre in [[Lidcombe]] and its battle with the local municipal council that wants to shut it down.<ref><U+201C>Lebanese Muslims Speak Back: Two Films by Tom Zubrycki<U+201D> by Susie Khamis, in [http://www.intellectbooks.co.uk/books/view-Book,id=4640/ ''Diasporas of Australian Cinema''] eds: Simpson, Murawska and Lambert. Intellect Press. 2009</ref> In 2011, he completed ''The Hungry Tide'', a personal story about the impact of climate change on the small Pacific nation of [[Kiribati]],<ref>"The Hungry Tide". Review by Shweta Kishore in ''[[Metro Magazine]]'', Issue 171, 2012</ref> which was premiered at the [[Sydney Film Festival]] and screened in competition at [[IDFA]].<ref><U+201C>The Documentary as Privileged Access<U+201D> in Lumina Journal No 8, [[Australian Film, Television and Radio School]]. 2011</ref>

Zubrycki is currently{{when}} in production on his own next film ''Back to Ground Zero'', about a Sudanese refugee returning after 27 years to his homeland of [[South Sudan]], the youngest nation on earth, with plans to build a school for girls in the village he grew up.{{fact}}

==Producer==

In the early 1990s, Zubrycki started producing the work of emerging directors. One of the first films he produced was ''Exile in Sarajevo'' (1996), a personal story about the last of the [[Siege of Sarajevo]] during the [[Balkan Wars|Balkan war]]. The film won an International Emmy in 1998.<ref name=reichert/>

Zubrycki continues to work as a producer with new and emerging directors. His latest is ''The Sunnyboy'' (2013) about [[Jeremy Oxley]] the enigmatic lead singer of the 80's band the [[Sunnyboys]] and his gradual recovery from [[schizophrenia]] leading to the band's successful come-back. The film premiered at the [[Sydney Opera House]] in 2013 as part of the Vivid Festival and the [[Sydney Film Festival]].
