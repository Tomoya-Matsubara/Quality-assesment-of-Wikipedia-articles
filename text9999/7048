'''Michael Cathel Fallon''' <small>[[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|PC]] [[Member of parliament|MP]]</small> (born 14 May 1952) is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[politician]] and [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Sevenoaks (UK Parliament constituency)|Sevenoaks]].

Since 15 July 2014, he has served as [[Secretary of State for Defence]], having previously been [[Conservative Party (UK)|Vice Chairman of the Conservative Party]].

==Early life==
[[File:Epsom College main building.jpg|thumb|left|Epsom College]]
Fallon, the son of surgeon Martin Fallon [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]], was educated at Craigflower School in [[Dunfermline]] and at [[Epsom College]], an [[Independent school (United Kingdom)|independent boys' school]] in Surrey. He then went up to the [[University of St Andrews]], where he read [[Classics]] and [[Ancient History]], graduating in 1974 with a [[Master of Arts (Scotland)|Master of Arts (MA)]] degree.

==Political career==
As a student, Fallon was active in the [[European Movement]] and the [[United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum, 1975|"Yes" youth campaign in the 1975 referendum]]. After university he joined the [[Conservative Research Department]], working first for [[Peter Carington, 6th Baron Carrington|Lord Carrington]] in the [[House of Lords]] until 1977 and then as European Desk Officer until 1979.  In 1979 he became Research Assistant to former [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]], [[Diana Elles, Baroness Elles|Baroness Elles]].

In July 1982 he was selected as the Conservative Parliamentary Candidate for [[Darlington (UK Parliament constituency)|Darlington]] to fight the [[Darlington by-election, 1983|Darlington by-election]] on 24 March 1983, following the death of Labour MP [[Edward Fletcher (politician)|Ted Fletcher]]. Although he lost to Labour's [[Oswald O'Brien|Ossie O'Brien]] by some 2,412 votes, just 77 days later he defeated O'Brien by 3,438 votes in the June 1983 general election. He remained MP for Darlington until the [[United Kingdom general election, 1992|1992 General Election]] when he was defeated by Labour's [[Alan Milburn]] by a margin of 2,798 votes.

He re-entered Parliament at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997]] [[general election]] representing the safe Conservative constituency of [[Sevenoaks (UK Parliament constituency)|Sevenoaks]] following the retirement of the sitting Tory MP, [[Mark Wolfson]], and has served as the MP there since.

==Parliamentary career==
In [[Palace of Westminster|parliament]] Michael Fallon was appointed as the [[Parliamentary Private Secretary]] to the [[Secretary of State for Energy]] [[Cecil Parkinson]] following the [[United Kingdom general election, 1987|1987 General Election]], and in 1988 joined the government of [[Margaret Thatcher]] as an Assistant Whip, becoming a [[HM Treasury#Whips|Lord Commissioner to the Treasury]] in 1990.

Mrs Thatcher appointed him [[Parliamentary Under Secretary of State]] for the [[Department for Education and Skills (United Kingdom)|Department for Education and Science]] in July 1990 a position he continued to hold under the new [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|premiership]] of [[John Major]]. He remained in that office until his 1992-General Election defeat.

Between 1992-97, Fallon set up a chain of children<U+2019>s nurseries called ''Just Learning'' with funding from [[Dragons' Den (UK)]] star [[Duncan Bannatyne]], where he became [[chief executive]].<ref>{{cite web |first=Tiffany |last=Holland|url=http://www.retail-week.com/profile-michael-fallon-minister-for-business/5040550.article|title=Profile: Michael Fallon, Minister for business|publisher=retail-week.com |date=14 September 2012 |accessdate=10 October 2012}}</ref>

Following his return to Parliament at the 1997 General Election he was appointed Opposition Spokesman for [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Trade and Industry]] and then [[Shadow]] [[Financial Secretary to the Treasury]], but he resigned from the front-bench owing to ill-health in October 1998, and remained on the backbenches until his promotion as Deputy Chairman of the Party.

From 1999 he was a member of the [[Treasury Select Committee]], and chairman of its Sub-Committee (2001-10).  He also served as a [[1922 Committee]] executive between 2005-07.

In September 2012, he was sworn of the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/9520858/Michael-Fallon-becomes-business-minister.html|title=Michael Fallon becomes business minister|date=5 September 2012|work=Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=26 October 2014}}</ref> upon his appointment as [[Minister (government)|Minister]] for [[Department for Business, Innovation and Skills|Business and Enterprise]].

Fallon has been a director at [[Tullett Prebon]], a leading brokerage firm in the City of London, and one of the biggest supporters of the [[privatisation]] of [[Royal Mail]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2013-02-07a.411.8|title=Debate on Royal Mail Privatisation|publisher=|accessdate=26 October 2014}}</ref>

In January 2014 Fallon was appointed [[Minister for Portsmouth]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hampshire-25753398|title=BBC News - Minister for Portsmouth to be Michael Fallon|work=BBC News|accessdate=26 October 2014}}</ref> subsequently being promoted to the Cabinet, on 15 July 2014, as [[Secretary of State for Defence]].

===Expenses scandal===
{{Unreferenced|section|date=July 2014}}
According to one newspaper report, Fallon, Deputy Chairman of the Treasury Select Committee, claimed for mortgage repayments on his Westminster flat in their entirety. MPs are only allowed to claim for interest charges.

Between 2002 and 2004, Fallon regularly claimed <U+00A3>1,255 per month in capital repayments and interest, rather than the <U+00A3>700-<U+00A3>800 for the interest-component alone. After his error was noticed by staff at the Commons Fees Office in September 2004, he asked: "Why has no one brought this to my attention before?" He repaid <U+00A3>2,200 of this over-claim, but was allowed to offset the remaining <U+00A3>6,100 against his allowance. After realising they had failed to notice the excessive claims, Commons staff suggested Fallon submit fresh claims which would "reassign" the surplus payments to other costs he had legitimately incurred.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mps-expenses/5358001/MPs-expenses-Michael-Fallon-claimed-8300-too-much-in-mortgage-expenses.html|title=MPs' expenses: Michael Fallon claimed <U+00A3>8,300 too much in mortgage expenses|author=Jon Swaine|date=21 May 2009|work=Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=26 October 2014}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Fallon has been married to Wendy Elisabeth Payne since 1986 and they have two sons and the family lives in [[Sundridge, Kent]]. While he was out of Parliament he was a director of Quality Care Homes plc and other companies founded by [[Dragon's Den]] star [[Duncan Bannatyne]].
