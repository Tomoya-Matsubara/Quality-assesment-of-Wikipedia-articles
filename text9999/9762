'''Radama II''' (23 September 1829 &ndash; 12 May 1863 [assumed dead]) was king of the [[Merina Kingdom]] which controlled nearly all the island of  [[Madagascar]]. He ruled from 1861 until he was believed assassinated in 1863.

==Upbringing and early years==
Radama II was born Prince Rakoto (Rakotosehenondradama).  He was officially recognized as the son of King [[Radama I]] and his widow Queen [[Ranavalona I]], although the king had died more than nine months before the prince's birth. He was likely fathered by a lover of his mother, Andriamihaja, a progressive young officer of the [[Merina]] army who the queen may have been tricked into putting to death by conservative ministers at court.<ref name="Oliver">Oliver, Samuel. ''Madagascar: An Historical and Descriptive Account of the Island and its Former Dependencies, Volume 1.'' Macmillan and Co., 1886.</ref>

After his mother succeeded Radama on the throne, she instituted an increasingly regressive regime that attempted to restore traditional values and contain or eliminate westernization. The prince, however, who had been highly influenced by the French advisor to the queen, [[Joseph-Fran<U+00E7>ois Lambert]], was favorably impressed by European culture, knowledge and its superior state of economic, political and technological development.  He was troubled by some of the socially repressive policies pursued by Ranavalona I.  The French played on this sympathy in 1857 by pressuring Prince Rakoto into [[Ranavalona I#Foreign plots|signing a request for French aid]] that would have enabled France to establish control over Madagascar had the true nature of the letter and its signing not been uncovered by Radama and his British contacts. 

Prior to Queen Ranavalona's death, the conservative and progressive factions within the [[Merina]] court waged a [[Ranavalona I#Internal divisions at court|tactical power struggle]] to secure a successor favorable to their own political agenda.<ref name="Ade">Ade Ajayi, J.F. ''Africa in the Nineteenth Century until the 1880s.'' UNESCO, 1989.</ref> The conservative faction favored Ramboasalama, the son of the Queen's sister, while the Queen's Prime Minister [[Rainivoninahitriniony]] and head of the army [[Rainilaiarivony]], brothers and progressives, supported Radama II.  The latter successfully obtained key strategic allies within the court that enabled Radama to seize the throne without violence following his mother's death. Ramboasalama was obliged to swear a public oath of allegiance to Radama, and was later sent into exile in the highland village of Ambohimirimo where he died in April 1962.<ref name="Oliver"/>

==Progressive reign==
Prince Rakoto ascended to the throne after the natural death of his mother in 1861, taking the name Radama II. Once upon the throne, he immediately attempted a rapid and dramatic reversal of many of his mother's traditionalist policies.  He reopened the country to foreign powers and concluded treaties of friendship with Britain and France. The [[Lambert Charter]] opened up business possibilities for French investors. Freedom of religion was declared, persecution of [[Christian]]s ceased and [[missionaries]] returned to the country and reopened  their missionary schools. The trial by ''tangena'' was abolished and inhabitants of Antananarivo were permitted to raise swine within the city walls, previously forbidden by a ''fady'' (taboo) forbidding them from being kept near the royal talismans (''sampy''); the ''sampy'' were dispersed to the [[Twelve sacred hills of Imerina|sacred villages]] where they had originated under 16th-century [[Merina]] king [[Ralambo]] and other early monarchs.<ref name="Oliver"/> Significantly, Radama freed numerous political prisoners captured during provincial wars of subjugation and offered repatriation of property confiscated during the aggressions under Ranavalona I; this generous pardon was reciprocated by many of the beneficiary ethnic groups around the island, and good will between the coasts and central administration at Antananarivo improved significantly.<ref name="Oliver"/> These changes, and the king himself, were unequivocably praised by Madagascar's European partners:

{{Bquote|"It is most remarkable that Radama II should have formed views of policy so large and liberal, so enlightened, humane and patriotic as those which form the foundation of his throne; that the son of such a mother, trained up under a despotism so dark, and restrictive and cruel, should have adopted such principles of religious freedom and political economy, as equal civil liberty and universal free trade principles, which our own nation has been so slow to learn, and which are still repudiated in many lands where civilization is far advanced."<ref name="Various. 2008">Various. ''Madagascar: Its Mission and Its Martyrs.'' Read Books, 2008.</ref>}}

The reaction within [[Imerina]] was less one-sided.  The abrupt and dramatic policy changes pursued by the progressive king alienated and disfranchised established conservative factions among the [[andriana]] (nobles) and [[Hova]] (freemen) at court. The special privileges accorded to [[Joseph-Fran<U+00E7>ois Lambert]] and his partners under the [[Lambert Charter]] - including the implementation of public works projects (felling trees, making roads, building canals etc.), control over minting coinage, exclusive mining rights and more as part of the purview of Lambert's proposed ''Compagnie de Madagascar'' (French Madagascar Company) - were especially controversial.  The citizens' concern stemmed from clauses in the agreement that would have permit Lambert's company to become permanent owners of Malagasy lands.  Until this point, land in Madagascar, which was viewed by the populace as the sacred ground of the ancestors, could only ever be temporarily possessed by foreigners until their death, at which point the land would revert to the crown. The threat of permanently losing any part of sacred Malagasy soil to foreigners was deeply troubling.<ref name="Oliver"/><ref>Note: Similarly, the November 2008 agreement to lease large tracts of Malagasy land to the South Korean company DaeWoo was a major factor leading to the 2009 ''coup d'etat'' that brought down the Ravalomanana regime.</ref>

==Attempted assassination==
The legalization of dueling was ultimately the issue that brought to a head the tension between King Radama II's entourage (mostly friends and some established political figures, known collectively as the ''menamaso'' or "red-eyes") and representatives of the opposition led by Radama's prime 
minister [[Rainivoninahitriniony]].  On May 7, 1863, Radama II announced his intention to allow disputes to be settled by a duel, much to the disapproval of many of his advisers at court. The prime minister prevented the law from being publicly declared at the ''Zoma'' (Friday) market the following day.  Friday afternoon, the prime minister's younger brother, [[Rainilaiarivony]], who was head of the army, called several thousand troops into the city to besiege a number of the ''menamaso'' and members of the royal family at the [[Rova of Antananarivo|Rova palace compound]], and by Saturday morning the decision had been made and carried out to execute eleven of the ''menamaso'' and other key political figures who had counseled Radama to legalize dueling. On Sunday, May 10, [[Rainivoninahitriniony]] demanded that Radama hand over the ''menamaso'' he was sheltering in the palace, which he refused to do until the Prime Minister agreed to spare their lives; they were handed over but by Monday morning had all been speared to death.

The drama ended on Tuesday morning, May 12, 1863, when a group of officers and soldiers forced their way into the palace and seized the king. His wife, queen [[Rasoherina|Rabodo]], pleaded for his life to be spared and attempted to stop them but was forcibly removed. The soldiers threw a [[lamba (garment)|lamba]] over Radama's head and strangled him with a silk sash until he was believed to be dead, thereby avoiding the shedding of royal blood as was the custom for royal executions in [[Imerina]].<ref name="Oliver"/> 

The nobles informed Rabodo that she would have their support as queen on the condition that she would accept to abide by certain articles that would form a new contract between rulers and ruled in Madagascar:

{{Bquote|"For the future the word of the sovereign alone was not to be law, but that the sovereign, the nobles and the heads of the people were to unite in making the laws; that the friendship with foreigners was to be maintained; that no one was to be put to death on the word of the sovereign alone, but that the nobles and the heads of the people must concur in the sentence before it could be inflicted; that religion and worship were to be equally free to all - to natives and foreigners, to Christians and non-Christians - excepting in [[Ambohimanga]] where there should be no public worship. The ordeal of tangena was not to be used, but death should be inflicted for great crimes."<ref name="Various. 2008"/>}}

[[Rasoherina|Rabodo]] agreed to these conditions. The next morning, it was publicly announced in the marketplace that Radama had taken his own life due to grief over the deaths of his compatriots the ''menamaso'' and that Rabodo would succeed him as Queen [[Rasoherina]]. To cement the new power-sharing agreement between the ruler, the nobles and the heads of the people, a political marriage was contracted between the queen and Prime Minister [[Rainivoninahitriniony]], who had been instrumental in her first husband's death.<ref name="Various. 2008"/> Radama's name was struck from the list of kings and it was declared illegal to mourn his death.<ref name = "Camille">De La Vaissi<U+00E8>re, Camille. 1884. [http://books.google.com/books?id=McQHAAAAQAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Histoire+de+Madagascar:+ses+habitants+et+ses+missionnaires,&hl=en&ei=hDURTZjqE4XGsAPrlI3IAg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false ''Histoire de Madagascar: ses habitants et ses missionnaires, Volume 1.'']  {{fr}}</ref>

==Rumors of survival==
Following Radama II's apparent death, rumors spread that he had only been rendered unconscious by the attempt on his life and had revived after his murderers hastily placed his body in a tomb at [[Twelve sacred hills of Imerina#Hill of Ilafy|Ilafy]]. It was believed that he was residing on the west coast of the island and had gained supporters.  The rumors persisted to the point of causing some political turmoil in the Merina capital.<ref name = "Camille"/> 

These claims may have had some substance judging by the actions of others. Prominent Christian missionaries outside the capital made extensive efforts to visit and support Radama but seemingly never succeeded. Traditionalist factions within the government were concerned enough by the rumors to have put to death sixteen of his supporters, as well as fining hundreds of others.<ref>Brown, Mervyn. ''A History of Madagascar.'' Markus Wiener Publishers, 2002.</ref>  In the mid-1960s, a study by Raymond Delval provided very strong evidence that Radama did indeed survive and, having failed to regain the throne, lived to old age as an ordinary citizen in the north of the island.<ref name="Ade"/>

With the apparent murder of Radama II, the power of the Merina monarchs was broken. Subsequent monarchs were controlled by influential Hova ([[Merina]] freemen), particularly [[Rainilaiarivony]], who became Prime Minister and successively married all three remaining queens of the monarchy: [[Rasoherina]], [[Ranavalona II]] and [[Ranavalona III]].
