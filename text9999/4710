Sturm started his professional career in 1936 in the New York Yankees organization. In 1939 and 1940, he played for the [[American Association (20th century)|American Association]]'s [[Kansas City Blues (American Association)|Kansas City Blues]] alongside the lethal [[double play]] combination of [[Phil Rizzuto]] and [[Jerry Priddy]].<ref>Weiss, Bill and Wright, Marshall. [http://www.minorleaguebaseball.com/milb/history/top100.jsp?idx=12 "1939 Kansas City Blues"]. ''minorleaguebaseball.com''. Retrieved 2010-11-03.</ref> The Blues won two league championships, and Sturm hit over .300 in both seasons. He joined the Yankees in 1941, replacing [[Babe Dahlgren]] at first base.

Sturm sat on the bench early in the season but broke into the lineup after the other [[infielder]]s - including [[List of members of the Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall of Famers]] Rizzuto and [[Joe Gordon]] - got off to slow starts.<ref name="prospectus">Goldman, Steven.

Retrieved 2010-11-03.</ref> Sturm hit just .239 for the Yankees but still batted first in the lineup the rest of the way. He later claimed to have a back injury that year.<ref name="prospectus"/> He did, however, hit .286 in the [[1941 World Series]]; the Yankees defeated the [[Los Angeles Dodgers|Brooklyn Dodgers]] in five games. After the season, Sturm enlisted in the [[United States Army]] and served in [[World War II]]. He was out of professional baseball from 1942 to 1945 and lost the tip of his right index finger in a tractor accident.<ref name="thedeadballera"/>

In 1946, Sturm tried to come back to the major leagues but broke his wrist.<ref name="thedeadballera"/> He played and managed in the minors for the rest of the decade, hitting .360 for the [[Joplin Miners]] in 1948.<ref>[http://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/player.cgi?id=sturm-001joh "Johnny Sturm Minor League Statistics & History"]. ''baseball-reference.com''. Retrieved 2010-11-03.</ref> He is also known as the man who first recommended [[Mickey Mantle]] to the Yankees.<ref name="obituary">Litsky, Frank.
