==Today==
Ganondagan has a visitors center, a reconstructed Seneca long house and miles of trails at this location of a 17th century [[Seneca tribe|Seneca]] village. The Friends of Ganondagan have created an effort to preserve not only the Ganondagan land but the cultural traditions as well.

Ganondagan was once the largest Seneca town within the Western gateway of Haudenosaunee territory. It is also at the center of the story of the Peacemaker, who unified the Haudenosaunee people and created the Haudenosaunee confederacy which survives to this day. The Three Sisters consist of corn, beans, and squash and are traditionally the staple foods of the Haudenosaunee. <ref>{{cite web|last=Burkard|first=Kimberly|title=Knowing the Three Sisters|url=http://www.ganondagan.org/pdf/KnowingTheThreeSisters.pdf|publisher=Friends of Ganondagan|accessdate=04/15/12}}</ref> 

Seneca oral tradition tells of a [[Wyandot people|Huron]] man who arrived among the [[Mohawk Nation|Mohawks]] speaking of the Gayanesshagowa <ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|title=The First Lady's Treasure Tour|url=http://clinton2.nara.gov/WH/EOP/First_Lady/html/treasures/715c.html|publisher=White House Millennium Council|accessdate=04/15/12}}</ref> (aka The Great Law of Peace).  This prophet is known today as [[The Great Peacemaker]]. The Mohawk, [[Oneida tribe|Oneida]], and [[Cayuga nation|Cayuga]] pledged to join his proposed confederation, and following a dramatic interlude, the Seneca agreed also.  The discussion about how to bring in the [[Onondaga (tribe)|Onondaga]] found its way into the house of a Seneca woman, Jikonsase, now known as the Mother of Nations. She proposed a solution which eventually brought the Onondaga into the fold. She lived in the vicinity of Ganondagan, and is buried nearby. The Seneca refer to Ganondagan as the "Town of Peace", and revere and protect the burial site of the Mother of Nations. Through this experience the Seneca gave us the foundation for our democracy today. <ref>{{cite web|last=Friends of Ganondagan|title=Ganondagan|url=http://www.ganondagan.org/|publisher=Friends of Ganondagan|accessdate=04/15/12}}</ref>  

Ganondagan and its adjoining fields were burned on July 14, 1687, as part of the punitive expedition from [[Montreal]] led by the [[Marquis de Denonville]].<ref>Published primary accounts of the French expedition include Jacques-Rene de Brisay de Nonville, <U+201C>Narrative of the expedition of the Marquis de Nonville against the Senecas, in 1687,<U+201D> trans.

The Seneca people have made many contributions to America throughout its history. The political ideals the Seneca people had were contributed to the U.S. Constitution. Seneca's matriarchal societal ideals also led to the 1848 declaration of sentiments in which women received the right to vote. <ref>[http://www.ganondagan.org/aboutganondagan.html About Ganondagan<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
