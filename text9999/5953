''Boxing Fever'' is a [[first person (video games)|first person]] boxing game, with the game's perspective being behind the eyes of your fighter in a ring.

As of 2009, ''Boxing Fever'' has received compilation scores of 76% and 75% on [[MetaCritic]] and [[GameRankings]] respectively.

==Gameplay==
The game places the player from the perspective of the figher, in a [[first person (video games)|first person]] view; the graphical engine gives the illusion of 3D. The user punches and blocks with the [[d-pad]], while avoiding punches entirely by weaving with the shoulder buttons.<ref name="IGN" />

There are four championships for the player to complete in throughout the course of gameplay; all of them are available from the start of gameplay and do not need to be earned through performance in the game. ''Boxing Fever'' lacks a battery save feature, and instead uses an 8-digit [[password (video games)|password system]].<ref name="IGN">{{cite web|title=Boxing Fever Review|author=Harris, Craig|date=October 23, 2001|publisher=IGN |url=http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/166/166843p1.html|accessdate=December 13, 2009}}</ref>
