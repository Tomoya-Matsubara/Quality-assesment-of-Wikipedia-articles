'''Harold Falkner''' (1875-1963) was a notable British [[architect]] in the early 20th Century and is now considered a leading exponent of the [[vernacular]]  and the [[arts & crafts]] in [[architecture]]. Most of his surviving buildings are in [[West Surrey]].

== Biography ==
=== Career ===
Based out of the modest market-town of [[Farnham]], in [[Surrey]], his buildings, around 115 of them, are all in that area. A lifelong friend of [[Gertrude Jekyll]], he was a near-contemporary of [[Edwin Lutyens]], many of whose buildings can be seen in the same area. He was frequently featured in the architectural press of the time and produced a range of differing styles of building, from [[Arts and Crafts movement|Arts and Crafts]] and [[Queen Anne Style architecture|Queen Anne]] to neo-[[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] and [[Tudor style architecture|Tudor]]. His relative obscurity has been attributed <ref>Harold Falkner - More than an Arts & Crafts Architect by Sam Osmond (Phillimore, 2003)</ref> to his refusal to adopt the [[Modern Movement]] and his rather obstinate character. His [[obituary]] in the [[Architectural Review]] was written by Sir [[Nikolaus Pevsner]]. 

His houses include Stranger's Corner (the former home of [[W. H. Allen]]), the Farnham Town Hall buildings and Bailiff's Hall (both [[Listed building|Grade II listed]]), the Tudor-style "Spinning Wheel" building in the Borough. The (former) Jolly Farmer, Runfold is a fine brick and stone building and the cottages next to Manor Farm in Seale are a good essay in the sort of workers<U+2019> cottages being built all over the [[Surrey]] countryside in this period. Delarden in Moor Park is a very interesting rendered country house. Although less successful is his scheme for the Sampsons Almshouses (1933-4) on West Street, Farnham, which is not nearly as good as the Macdonalds Almshouses (1908) next door. These Almshouses were designed by Farnham<U+2019>s other prominent architect of the day, [[Arthur Stedman]], who was probably his most significant competitor.

===Dippenhall===
The Falkners had a large land ownership in this small village just a mile or so to the North-West of [[Farnham]]. It was here that he realized some of his most interesting works as he built throughout his career a dozen or so important houses, using a variety of refurbishments, extensions and recycled old buildings as a haven for the vernacular architecture of [[West Surrey]]. 

Dippenhall Houses: 
*Dippenhall Grange
*Overdeans Court
*Halfway House (Dora's Green).
*Deans Knowe
*The Barn
*Meads
*Burles
*Burles Lodge
*Grovers Farm
*The Old Barn

===Farnham & Charles Borelli===
Falkner is reputed to have been a key contributor to the preservation of [[Farnham]] as one of the best [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] towns in [[England]]<ref>as ref 1</ref>. [[Nicholas Pevsner]]<ref>Surrey by [[Nickolaus Pevsner]] (Penguin, 1971)</ref> disagreed with the derivation of the town as a Georgian gem and considered the town to be a reproduction of the what the [[Victorian era|Victorians]] thought a [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] town should look like. Nonetheless, with the local politician, [[Charles Borelli]], his life-long friend and collaborator, Falkner was responsible for some important works to preserve and enhance the town centre of [[Farnham]], at a time when few architects respected the need to maintain this cultural heritage. [[Farnham]] remains the town it is today, as a large part the result of their joint advocacy. Such buildings as 40, 41 & 42 The Borough, The Town Hall Buildings, 10 Castle Street, the Bush Hotel and the Bailiffs Hall exemplify his approach of careful addition, renewal and recycling.

===Partnership with Guy Maxwell Alwyn===
He also did much work in collaboration with the prominent Farnham architect, Guy Maxwell Alwyn with whom he was in loose partnership, including rebuilds of many local [[pub]]s for [[Courage (brewery)|Courage's]] brewery, including the Seven Stars on East Street. Guy Maxwell Alwyn was from a family of local architects, father and son, much like his contemporary, [[Arthur Stedman]] and son, Leonard. Alwyn, like the younger Stedman was apprenticed at the offices of [[Sir Edwin Lutyens]], who was raised just outside [[Farnham]] and built many of his earliest and most successful projects there. Falkner, Stedman and Alwyn are the three locally born [[arts & crafts]] architects that made the most significant contribution to the area<U+2019>s cultural heritage in this period.

===Roderick Gradidge & Michael Blower===
A number of his projects have been altered, restored and extended by the twin and eminent skills of architects, [[Michael Blower]] of [[Farnham]] and [[Roderick Gradidge]] of [[Chiswick]], such as Overdeans Court, The Priory, Merlewood & Tancreds Ford (for the author [[Ken Follett]]). The latter was the subject of two fine articles in [[Country Life]] by [[Clive Aslet]] <ref>Country Life November 17th & 24th 1983</ref>.

=== Personal life ===
Harold Falkner was born into a wealthy land-owning family in the [[Surrey]] town of [[Farnham]] on the 28th November 1875, just 5 months after his father<U+2019>s death. The family settled at 24 West Street, [[Farnham]] in 1883 and it was in this house that the young boy remained, running his architectural practice there until his death at the age of 80 on 30 November 1963. He was never married and had no surviving children, his estate passing to his sister<U+2019>s family.

== Legacy ==
Part of his archive and some of his architectural drawings survive and are housed in the Farnham Museum. Some of his archive can also be found in Stedman Blower Architects archive, in the hands of the Blower Foundation. The houses of Dippenhall remain his most lasting legacy and within a few hectares stand a dozen or so buildings designed, built and altered by him throughout his career. Fortunately most are Grade 2 [[Listed Buildings]] and will remain along with his significant contribution to the town centre of [[Farnham]], and the restoration and sensitive infill projects that he designed.
