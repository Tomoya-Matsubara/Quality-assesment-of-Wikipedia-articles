She also often appeared as an alto soloist in oratorios and cantatas by Bach and Handel.

== Life ==
Dolukhanova was born Zara Makaryan, in [[Moscow]], to Armenian musical parents - her mother, Elena Makaryan, was a singer, and her father, Aghasi Makaryan, was a [[flautist]], [[clarinettist]] and [[trumpeter]]. She first studied the piano, then the violin, but finally decided at age 16 that she wanted to study singing. She studied at the [[Gnessin Institute]] in Moscow with V. Belyayeva-Tarassevitch.  She made her operatic debut in 1938 with the [[Yerevan]] Opera as Siebel in [[Charles Gounod|Gounod]]'s [[Faust (opera)|Faust]].

During [[World War II]], Dolukhanova worked at the Opera Theatre of Yerevan and married the composer Alexander Dolukhanian.  She left the stage in 1944, when she became a soloist with [[Moscow Radio]] and then in 1959 a leading soloist with the [[Moscow Philharmonic Orchestra]].

In the 1970s, she retired from singing and taught at the Gnessin Institute.  Among her pupils was the mezzo-soprano [[Olga Borodina]].

She died in Moscow.
