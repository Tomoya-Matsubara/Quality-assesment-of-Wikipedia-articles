==History==
===Founding===
The [[Genesee Wesleyan Seminary]] was founded in 1832 by the Genesee [[Annual Conference]] of the [[Methodist Episcopal Church]] in Lima, New York, south of [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]]. In 1850, it was resolved to enlarge the institution from a seminary into a college, or to connect a college with the seminary, becoming [[Genesee College]]. However, the location was soon thought by many to be insufficiently central. Its difficulties were compounded by the next set of technological changes: the railroad that displaced the Erie Canal as the region's economic engine bypassed Lima completely. The trustees of the struggling college then decided to seek a locale whose economic and transportation advantages could provide a better base of support. The college began looking for a new home at the same time that Syracuse, ninety miles to the east, was engaged in a search to bring a university to the city, having failed to convince [[Ezra Cornell]] and [[Andrew Dickson White]] to locate [[Cornell University]] there rather than in [[Ithaca, New York|Ithaca]].<ref name="PioneerYears">{{cite book|last=Galpin|first=WF|title=Syracuse University: The Pioneer Years|publisher=Syracuse University Press|location=Syracuse, NY|year=1952}}</ref><ref name="Greene"/> White pressed that the university should locate on the hill in [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]] (the current location of Syracuse University) due to the city's attractive transportation hub, which would ease the recruitment of faculty, students, and other persons of note. However, as a young carpenter working in Syracuse, Cornell had been robbed of his wages,<ref>Goldwin Smith, Reminiscences(New York, 1911), p.371;quoted in Morris Bishop(1962), p.11, A History of Cornell. Cornell University Press</ref> not once but twice<ref>Carol Kammen, 2003, p. 13 "Glorious to View Cornell", Cornell University Library; Ithaca,NY</ref> and thereafter considered Syracuse a [[Sodom and Gomorrah]] insisting that the university be located in [[Ithaca, New York|Ithaca]] on his large farm on East Hill, overlooking the town and [[Cayuga Lake]].

After a year of dispute between the Methodist ministers, Lima, and contending cities across the state, it was decided to move the former Genesee College to Syracuse, where it was to become the nucleus of Syracuse University. The college, its libraries, students, faculty, and two secret societies all relocated to Syracuse. On March 24, 1870, the state of New York granted the University its charter and [[Jesse T. Peck|Bishop Jesse Truesdell Peck]] was elected the first president of the Board of Trustees.<ref name="Greene">{{cite book |author=Greene, John Edward |title=The Hill: an illustrated biography of Syracuse University (SU), 1870-present |publisher=Syracuse University Press |location=Syracuse |year=2000 |isbn=0-8156-0648-6}}</ref> George F. Comstock, a member of the new University's Board of Trustees, had offered the school {{convert|50|acre|m2}} of farmland on a hillside to the southeast of the city center. Comstock intended Syracuse University and the hill to develop as an integrated whole; a contemporary account described the latter as "a beautiful town ... springing up on the hillside and a community of refined and cultivated membership ... established near the spot which will soon be the center of a great and beneficent educational institution."<ref name="architectural">{{cite book|last=Gorney|first=J|title=Syracuse University: an architectural guide|publisher=Syracuse University Press|location=Syracuse, NY|year=2006|isbn=0815608101}}</ref>

===Expansion===
Coeducation at Syracuse traced its roots to the early days of the Genesee College where suffragists like [[Frances Willard (suffragist)|Frances Willard]] and [[Belva Lockwood]] began to distinguish themselves nationally. However, the progressive "co-ed" policies initiated at Genesee would soon find controversy at the new university in Syracuse.<ref name="Greene"/>  Colleges and universities admitted few women students in the 1870s. Administrators and faculty argued women had inferior minds and could not master mathematics and the classics. Dr. [[Erastus Otis Haven]], Syracuse University chancellor and former president of the [[University of Michigan]] and [[Northwestern University]], maintained that women should receive the advantages of higher education. He enrolled his daughter, Frances, at SU, where she was initiated in the newly formed Gamma Phi Beta sorority.<ref name="Greene"/>

In the late 1880s the University resumed construction on the south side of University Place. Holden Observatory (1887) was followed by two Romanesque Revival buildings <U+2013> von Ranke Library (1889), now Tolley Administration Building, and Crouse College (1889). Together with the Hall of Languages, these first buildings formed the basis for the "Old Row," a grouping which, along with its companion Lawn, established one of Syracuse's most enduring images.<ref name="architectural"/> The emphatically linear organization of these buildings along the brow of the hill follows a tradition of American campus planning which dates to the construction of the "Yale Row" in the 1790s. At Syracuse, the Old Row continued to provide the framework for growth well into the twentieth century.<ref name="architectural"/>

From its founding until through early 1920s, the University grew rapidly. It offered programs in the physical sciences and modern languages, and in 1873, Syracuse added one of the first architecture programs in the U.S.<ref name="Greene2"/> In 1874, Syracuse created the nation's first bachelor of fine arts degree,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://syracuse.edu/aboutsu/chronology/1870.html |title=Syracuse University History | publisher= Syracuse University |accessdate=2008-09-17}}</ref> and in 1876, the school offered its first post-graduate courses in the College of Arts and Sciences.<ref name="Greene2"/> SU created its first doctoral program in 1911.<ref name="SU1906">{{cite web |url=http://www.syr.edu/aboutsu/chronology/1906.html |title=Syracuse University History 1906-1930 |publisher=Syracuse University|accessdate=2008-09-17}}</ref> SU's school of journalism, now the [[S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications]], was established at Syracuse in 1934.<ref name="SU1931">{{cite web |url=http://syracuse.edu/aboutsu/chronology/1931.html |title=Syracuse University History 1931-1950 |publisher=Syracuse University|accessdate=2008-09-17}}</ref>

The growth of Syracuse University from a small liberal arts college into a major comprehensive university were due to the efforts of two iconic men, Chancellor [[James Roscoe Day|James Day]] and [[John Dustin Archbold|John Archbold]]. James Roscoe Day was serving the Calvary Church in New York City where he befriended Archbold. Together, the two dynamic figures would oversee the first of two great periods of campus renewal in Syracuse's history.<ref name="Greene"/>

John Dustin Archbold was a capitalist, philanthropist, and President of the Board of Trustees at Syracuse University. He was known as John D. Rockefeller<U+2019>s right hand man and successor at the [[Standard Oil]] Company. He was a close friend of Syracuse University Chancellor James R. Day, and gave almost $6&nbsp;million to the University over his lifetime.<ref name="Greene"/> Said a journalist in 1917:
<blockquote>Mr. Archbold<U+2019>s ... is the president of the board of trustees of Syracuse University, an institution which has prospered so remarkably since his connection with it that its student roll has increased from hundreds to over 4,000, including 1,500 young women, placing it in the ranks of the foremost institutions of learning in the United States.<ref>{{cite book|last=Forbes|first=BC|title=Men who are making America|publisher=B.C. Forbes Publishing|location=New York, NY|year=1917|pages=440}}</ref></blockquote>
In addition to keeping the university financially solvent during its early years, he also contributed funds for eight buildings, including the full cost of Archbold Stadium (opened 1907, demolished 1978), Sims Hall (men's dormitory, 1907), the Archbold Gymnasium (1909, nearly destroyed by fire in 1947, but still in use), and the oval athletic field.

===Modern===
After World War II, Syracuse University began to transform into a major research institution. Enrollment increased in the four years after the war due to the [[G.I. Bill]], which paid tuition, room, board, and a small allowance for veterans returning from World War II. In 1946, SU admitted 9,464 freshmen, nearly four times greater than the previous incoming class.<ref name="SU1931"/>  Branch campuses were established in Endicott, NY and Utica, NY.
<blockquote>The velocity with which the university sped through its change into a major research institution was astounding. By the end of the 1950s, Syracuse ranked twelfth nationally in terms of the amount of its sponsored research, and it had over four hundred professors and graduate students engaging in that investigation.<ref name="Greene2">{{cite book |author=Baron, Karrie A.; Galpin, William Freeman; Wilson, Richard; Barck, Oscar Theodore; Greene, John Edward |title=Syracuse University |publisher=Syracuse University Press |location=Syracuse |year=1952 |pages= |isbn=0-8156-2701-7}}</ref></blockquote>

From the early 1950s through the 1960s, Syracuse University added programs and staff that continued the transformation of the school into a research university. In 1954, Arthur Phillips was recruited from [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] and started the first [[pathogen]]-free animal research laboratory. The lab focused on studying medical problems using animal models. In 1956, the School of Social Work was founded which eventually incorporated into the College of Human Ecology.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://syracuse.edu/aboutsu/chronology/1951.html |title=Syracuse University History, 1951-1960|publisher=Syracuse University|accessdate=2008-10-06}}</ref>  Syracuse's College of Engineering also founded the nation's second oldest computer engineering and bioengineering programs. In 1962, [[Samuel Irving Newhouse, Sr.]] donated $15&nbsp;million to begin construction of a school of communications, eventually known as the [[SI Newhouse School of Public Communications]]. In 1966, Syracuse University was admitted to the [[Association of American Universities]], an [[organization]] of leading research [[university|universities]] devoted to maintaining a strong system of academic [[research]] and education.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://syracuse.edu/aboutsu/chronology/1961.html |title=Syracuse University History, 1961-1970 |publisher=Syracuse University|accessdate=2008-10-06}}</ref>

===Pan Am flight 103===
[[Image:Syracuse University Flight 103 Memorial.jpg|thumb|200px|right|SU's Flight 103 Memorial]]
{{main|Pan Am Flight 103}}
On December 21, 1988, 35 Syracuse University students were among the fatalities in the terrorist bombing of [[Pan Am Flight 103]] over [[Lockerbie, Scotland|Lockerbie]], [[Scotland]]. The students were returning from a study-abroad program in Europe. 

That evening, Syracuse University went on with a [[basketball]] game just hours after the attack, for which it was severely criticized.<ref name="Conduct"/> The conduct of university officials in making the decision was also brought to the attention of the NCAA.<ref name="Conduct"/> The day after the bombing, the university's chancellor, [[Melvin A. Eggers]], said on nationwide television that he should have canceled the event.<ref name="Conduct">{{cite book|last=Deppa|first=Joan|title=The media and disasters: Pan Am 103|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York|year=1994|isbn=0-8147-1856-6}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=A Tragic End to the Semester|last=Yen|first=Marianne|date=1988-12-23|work=The Washington Post|page=A07}}</ref>

In April 1990 Syracuse University dedicated a memorial wall to the students killed on Flight 103, constructed at the entrance to the main campus in front of the Hall of Languages. Every year the university holds "Remembrance Week" during the fall semester to commemorate the students. On December 21 a service in the university's chapel at 2:03&nbsp;p.m. (19:03&nbsp;[[UTC]]) marks the exact minute on that date in 1988 when the plane exploded. The University also maintains a link to the tragedy with the "Remembrance Scholars" program, when 35 senior students receive scholarships during their final year at the University. With the "Lockerbie Scholars" program, two graduating students from Lockerbie Academy study at Syracuse for one year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://undergraduatestudies.syr.edu/Lockerbiescholars/home.html |title=Lockerbie Scholars |publisher=Syracuse University|accessdate=2008-10-06}}</ref>

The Storch is used primarily by the Drama Department and the Archbold is used primarily by Syracuse Stage, a professional [[Regional theater in the United States|regional theatre]].

===South campus===
After World War II, a large undeveloped hill owned by the university was used to house returning [[veterans]] in military-style campus housing. During the 1970s, this housing was replaced by permanent two-level townhouses for two or three students each, or for graduate family housing. There are also three small freshman-only residence halls which feature open doubles and a kitchen on every floor.
South Campus is also home to the Institute for Sensory Research, Tennity Ice Pavilion, Goldstein Student Center, Skytop Office Building and 621 Skytop Road (for administration) and the InnComplete Pub, a graduate student bar.

Approximately 2,500 students live on the South Campus, which is connected to the main campus by frequent bus service.

===Downtown===
In December 2004, the university announced that it had purchased or leased twelve buildings in [[downtown Syracuse]]. Two programs, Communications Design and Advertising Design from the College of Visual and Performing Arts reside permanently in the newly renovated facilities, fittingly called [[The Warehouse (Syracuse)|The Warehouse]], which was renovated by [[Gluckman Mayner Architects]]. Both programs were chosen to be located in the downtown area because of their history of working on projects directly with the community. The Warehouse also houses a contemporary art space that commissions, exhibits and promotes the work of local and international artists in a variety of media. Hundreds of students and faculty have also been affected by the temporary move of the School of Architecture downtown for the $12&nbsp;million renovation of its campus facility, Slocum Hall.

===Media===
[[Image:CitrusTV controlroom.jpg|200px|right|thumb|The CitrusTV control room during a taping of CitrusTV News]]

[[CitrusTV]] (formerly UUTV and HillTV) is the university's entirely student-run television station. CitrusTV produces news, sports and entertainment content that appears on the university's campus cable channel, the Orange Television Network, and online on the [http://www.citrustv.net CitrusTV.net] Web site and Syracuse.com. Some content also appears in Central New York on the cable channel [[Time Warner Cable Sports]]. The station used to be a part of University Union, the largest student organization on campus, until it split to become its own recognized student organization in 2004. The station was briefly known as HillTV until the middle of the fall 2005 semester, when the university shut the station down for controversial entertainment programming and demanded its reform. The station is located in the Robert B. Menschel Media Center, at the Waverly Avenue side of Watson Hall.

The school's independent student newspaper is ''[[The Daily Orange]]'', founded in 1903 and independent since 1971. The D.O. Alumni Association recently celebrated the paper's 100th anniversary.

[[WAER]] (88.3 [[FM broadcasting|FM]]) is located on the campus of SU, and is an auxiliary service of the school. The station features a jazz music and [[National Public Radio]] format, with a news and music staff providing programming around the clock. It is best known for its sports staff, which has produced the likes of [[Bob Costas]], [[Marv Albert]], [[Mike Tirico]], [[Sean McDonough]], [[Ian Eagle]], [[Brian Higgins]], [[Dick Stockton]] and many others. [[Lou Reed]] also hosted a free-format show on WAER during his time at Syracuse University; this free-format radio tradition at Syracuse is carried on by WERW.

[[WJPZ]] is a radio station owned and operated entirely by students at Syracuse University in New York. It broadcasts at 89.1 FM at an effective radiated power of 100 watts and can be heard throughout Syracuse, the rest of Onondaga County, and beyond to the north and east. WJPZ programs a tight CHR (Contemporary Hit Radio, or Top 40) format. Although operated by students, it is an independent organization which is incorporated and licensed by the FCC as WJPZ Radio, Inc. It is neither owned nor controlled by Syracuse University, but it does lease studio and transmitter facilities on Syracuse University property.

[[WERW]] is the entirely student-run, free format [[carrier current]] [[radio station]] on the SU campus. It is the only campus radio station currently being broadcast on iTunes college radio. The station can also be heard at 1570 AM. The studios are located in the Schine Student Center. Originally operating at 750AM, WERW was available only in the university's dorms and some other campus buildings. The station's current low power broadcast tower was erected atop the Booth Hall dormitory in 1995 to allow it to broadcast at 1570AM. With this new tower, WERW could be heard all across the university campus and in adjacent areas of the city of Syracuse.

There are also multiple student-run magazines and other print publications including The Student Voice, Jerk Magazine, What the Health, 360, and Equal Time.<ref>Syracuse Ed2010, "http://www.syracuseed2010.com/resources.html"</ref>

===Student government===
Founded in 1957, the Student Association (SA) represents the undergraduate students of both SU & SUNY-ESF. The SA, through the Student Assembly, oversees the allocation and designation of the Student Activity Fee that was first collected in the 1968&ndash;69 school year. The goals of the SA are to participate in the formulation of Syracuse University rules and regulations, by creating a unified student voice. The SA-SGA Alumni Organization maintains the history and an organizational timeline on its website.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://students.syr.edu/sa/about.html |title=Student Association | publisher= Syracuse University |accessdate=2008-09-18}}</ref>

The graduate students at Syracuse University are represented by the Graduate Student Organization (GSO) while the law students at Syracuse University are represented by the Law Student Senate. Each of the three organizations elects students to serve in the Syracuse University Senate, which also includes faculty and staff and is chaired by the SU Chancellor.

====University Union====
'''University Union''' is a Syracuse University student organization. Created in 1962 as the Syracuse University's Programming Board, the organization has gone through many transformations from student organization to "official" programming board back to student organization.

University Union is a union of several different entities including, Cinema Board, performing Arts Board, Concert Board, Bandersnatch Music Series (a subsidiary of Concert Board),  a 20-watt free format radio station [[WERW]] 1570 AM and the Promotion Board. The organization is entirely student-run and operated.

In 1959, Syracuse earned its first [[NCAA Division I-A national football champions|National Championship]] following an undefeated football season and a Cotton Bowl victory over [[University of Texas at Austin|Texas]]. The team featured sophomore running back [[Ernie Davis]] who, in 1961, became the first African-American to win the [[Heisman Trophy]]. Davis was slated to play for the [[Cleveland Browns]] in the same backfield as [[Jim Brown]], but died of [[leukemia]] before being able to play professionally.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cityofelmira.net/history/ernie_davis.html |title=Pages in the History of Elmira | Ernie Davis: the "Elmira Express" |publisher=City of Elmira |accessdate=2008-10-06}}</ref>

Syracuse played its first intercollegiate lacrosse game in 1916, and captured its first USILA championship in 1920. It would win USILA championships in 1922, 1924 and 1925. In the modern NCAA era, Syracuse is the first school to capture 11 National Championships, the most of any team in college lacrosse history. Syracuse has won the past 2 men's Div I lacrosse championships.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.suathletics.com/news/Lacrosse/mLacrosse/2008/5/26/mlax_jhu052608.asp?path=mLacrosse?path=mLacrosse |title=SU Athletics - National Champions Again!

Toward the end of the 1970s, Syracuse University was under pressure to improve its football facilities in order to remain a NCAA Division I football school. Its small concrete stadium, [[Archbold Stadium]], was seventy years old and not up to the standards of other schools. The stadium could not be expanded; it had been reduced from 40,000 seats to 26,000 due to the fire codes. Syracuse University decided to build a new stadium. In 1978, Archbold Stadium was demolished to make way for the Carrier Dome, which was to have a domed [[Teflon]]-coated, [[fiberglass]] [[air-supported structure|inflatable roof]]. It would also serve as the home for the men's basketball team, as a replacement for Manley Field House. The Carrier Dome was constructed between April 1979 and September 1980. The total construction cost was $26.85&nbsp;million, including a $2.75&nbsp;million [[naming rights|naming gift]] from the [[Carrier Corporation]].<ref>{{cite web
