'''Capacha''' is an archaeological site located about 6 kilometers northeast of the [[Colima, Colima|Colima Municipality]], in the [[Colima|Colima State]]. This site is the heart of the Capacha culture. 

The Capacha Culture is located between the Jalisco Sierra and the Colima Valley. Several sites in the region have relations with Capacha, Embocadero II (800 BCE), in the Mascota Valley, has a background with the shaft tomb tradition. There is also evidence of green stone articles, Jadeite cylindrical beads and possibly Amazonite, as well as Turquoise fragments.(Mountjoy 2004).<ref name=Lore > {{cite web |first=   Lorenza |last=  L<U+00F3>pez Mestas Camberos |title= Green Stones in Central Jalisco|url= http://www.famsi.org/reports/03083/index.html|publisher=   FAMSI |location= |language= |trans_title=  |year= 2004 |accessdate=Sept. 2010}}</ref> 

It is known there were close relations between Capacha and [[El Ope<U+00F1>o]], by the existing ceramic relationship between types red zonal and dark red/beige, as well as similarities between figurine types of both complexes.<ref>Oliveros 1974; Sch<U+00F6>ndube 1980: 151</ref> <ref name=Lore  />

This information is corroborated by Ope<U+00F1>o style figurines and Capacha type ceramic found in the area of Tuxpan - Tamazula - Zapotl<U+00E1>n;<ref>Lameiras 1990: 27; Sch<U+00F6>ndube 1974: 84 y ss.</ref> as well as in other Jalisco state places, where shaft tombs similar to El Ope<U+00F1>o and ceramic vessels similar to Capacha were found.<ref>Weigand y Beekman 2000: 41</ref><ref name=Lore/> 

In addition, the culture and Capacha had some kind of contact with cultures of the Center of Mexico, e.g. [[Tlatilco]], between 1300 and 900 BCE, which probably had a higher level of development at that time. Beatriz Braniff and other researchers pointed the presence of a "tertium quid" in central Mexico differentiated from Olmec traditions and the center of Mexico, whose origin was the western region.<ref>Braniff 1998: 28.</ref><ref name=Lore  />  

==Background==
During prehispanic times, the region of the Colima state was seat of various ethnic groups which flourished in western Mexico. The region was inhabited by various Lordships (not reigns as erroneously stated by some historians) that disputed the territories. At the beginning of the 16th century, pur<U+00E9>pecha or tarascan groups dominated several regions, the Tzacoalco salt mines owned by Tecos, because of this their leader Coliman or Tlatoani Colimotl defeated them, after the salt war, the Tecos took Sayula, Zapotl<U+00E1>n and Amula and even reached Mazamitla, becoming the predominant group. <ref name=WikiCol/>

===Culture origin===
Archaeologists recognize the origin of Mesoamerica in a "mother culture" represented by the Olmec style and culture. But in the western region no evidence has been found to date nothing that can be identified as such,<ref name=Beatriz   > {{cite web |first=   Beatriz |last=  Braniff C. |title=  Colima en los tiempos prehisp<U+00E1>nicos |url=  http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/colima-en-los-tiempos-prehispanicos.html|publisher= Mexico desconocido  |location= |language= Spanish|trans_title= Colima in prehispanic times  |year= |accessdate=Sept. 2010}}</ref> because no evidence of Teotihuacan influence has been found, or typically "Mesoamerican".

It is clear that Colima and other western regions had their own personality. The Colima artistic expressions in ceramic offerings in <U+201C>shaft tombs", reflect a society more "comfortable", free, equal, with family and household traits, totally different from artistic expressions of other societies. The detail and artistic quality of women, men, dogs, parrots, bats, snakes, etc., sculptures, evidence that artists carefully observed those everyday items.<ref name=Beatriz  />  

Who were these special ancestors? Recent excavations in Colima and Michoac<U+00E1>n enable us to recognize at least two roots, as old as the Olmec. Capacha, before 1500 BCE had burials that include beautiful ceramic "bules" and vases with "Stirrup<U+201D> handle, certain type figurines and metates.<ref name=Beatriz  />

===Discovery===
It was discovered and studied by [[Elizabeth Trusdell-Kelly]], American archaeologist who made excavations in the Colima area in 1939. Similarities between pieces of this culture and contemporary ceramics in the region of [[Ecuador]] suggest that there were some very the early western mesoamerican cultures and those of the Andes. 

==Capacha Culture==
By this name is known the Capacha archaeological site in [[Colima]]. Was the first with complex features and developed in the region, approximately between 2000 and 1200 BCE.
 
Capacha was contemporary of other important regional cultural developments, such as [[El Ope<U+00F1>o]], [[Michoac<U+00E1>n]], and the first [[Tlatilco]]phase in the Valley Mexico. The geographical spread of ceramic Capacha parts covers the [[Pacific]] coast, between the Mexican States of [[Sinaloa]], in the north, and [[Guerrero]] in south. Particularly important are the burials discovered by [[Gordon f. Ekholm]] in [[Guasave]], Sinaloa.


===Cultural Stages===
The cultural development of this area has been divided into seven phases, named for the sites where findings were made;<ref name=Olga > {{cite web |first=   Olga |last=  Cano |title=  Colima y sus tesoros, Numero 52 |url=  http://www.arqueomex.com/S8N4GVesp52.html|publisher=   Arqueolog<U+00ED>a Mexicana |location= |language= Spanish|trans_title= Colima and its treasures, number 52 |year= |accessdate=Sept. 2010}}</ref>

The Capacha Culture<ref> Includes the ceramics production that chronologically and geographically defines, the cultural life of the Group.</ref> includes nine sites identified in the eastern half of the Colima State. Archaeological elements of this tradition have been discovered in the states of Nayarit, Jalisco, Sinaloa, Guerrero, the Morelos, Michoac<U+00E1>n and Mexico.<ref>S. T. Evans, 2004: p. 156 / D. L<U+00E9>vine, 1998: p. 57 et pp. 68-69 / J. B. Mountjoy, 1994: p. 40 / E. Taladoire et B. Faug<U+00E8>re-Kalfon, 1995 : p. 87.</ref>

Among this sites are the following:

===El Ope<U+00F1>o===
El Ope<U+00F1>o is an archaeological site located in the municipality of Jacona, in the Michoac<U+00E1>n state, M<U+00E9>xico. It is home to a prehispanic site, mainly known from the ceramic material found in the funerary complexes of the site, which have been dated to the late preclassical mesoamerican period. The importance of this site in mesoamerican archaeology is due to its antiquity and the ample diffusion of its style, contemporary to other native culture developments such as the Capacha culture and earlier of the Chup<U+00ED>cuaro. El Ope<U+00F1>o tombs are the oldest in Mesoamerica. Have been dated to around 1600 BCE, hence they predate de Olmec culture development, with main centers in the Gulf of Mexico coast and flourished some centuries later.

===La Campana===
'''La Campana''' is an archaeological site located a few kilometers from Capacha, it is included in the Mexican archaeological heritage list since 1917. Located in the vicinity of the city of Colima. This site was the largest prehispanic population center in western Mexico. Site studies indicate that some of its features are related to the classical period Teotihuacan culture.<ref name=WikiCol > {{cite web |first=  |last=  |title=  Historia del Estado de Colima |url= http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colima#Historia |publisher= Wikipedia |location=  |language= Spanish |trans_title= History of the State of Colima  |year= |accessdate= Sept. 2010  }}</ref>
 
===Los Ortices Complex===
Archaeologists assign a period between 300 BCE and 300 CE; located southwest of Colima, in the vicinity of the Los Ortices village. This native settlement was more evolved than the Capacha site, they produced finer pottery, also made stone sculpture and buried their dead  in "shaft tombs", very characteristic of the region.<ref name= WikiCol />

===Armer<U+00ED>a & Colima Complex===
Chronologically placed between 600-1100 CE, in an area east of the Colima city, in the El Moralete neighborhood. This native group developed crafts with features somewhat more primitive than the others. Developed a smaller ceramics variety and built rougher shaft tombs.<ref name=WikiCol />

===El Chanal Complex===
[[El Chanal]] site developed the most representative style of the region, settled in the El Chanal community. In the mid-20th century a step pyramid was found; at the beginning of 1990s, discovered esplanades, temples, squares and a ballgame court: architectural evidence of a culture that had reached a high degree of evolution. By 1520, this complex had already disappeared and only remained in the area some native peoples, apparently subjected to another more powerful city, Tecom<U+00E1>n.<ref name=WikiCol />


==Important Aspects==
This important site and its cultural development, enabled the generation of several important civilization aspects, among which are the following:

*Capacha Ceramic Tradition 
*Shaft Tomb Tradition.
*Relationship evidence with South America.

===Capacha Ceramic===
[[File:Vasija capacha.jpg|thumb|300px|Capacha Culture Vessel.]]
Sample testing of ceramic specimens found in various sites of the Colima State, San Blas, Ixtapa and Tomatl<U+00E1>n (Jalisco) by Thermo-luminescence and carbon 14 have provided dates between 1320 and 220 BCE<ref> Ch. Duverger, 1999 : p. 177 et p. 183 / D. L<U+00E9>vine, 1998 : p. 68 / J. B. Mountjoy, op. cit.</ref>

Ceramic features

Capacha ceramic originality is based on two specific types:<ref>D. L<U+00E9>vine, 1998: p. 69 / J. B. Mountjoy, 1994: pp. 41-42 / E. Taladoire & B. Faug<U+00E8>re-Kalfon, p.87.</ref>

* Large ceramic vessels, shaped as two globular stacked vases, one over the other. Named Bule.<ref>S. T. Evans, p. 121</ref>

*Ceramics that consists of two superimposed globular vessels, interconnected by two or three tubes. This ceramic shape resembles the South American <U+201C>stirrup<U+201D> handle ceramic tradition.

===Shaft Tombs===
Ceramic from Colima cultures, was primarily deposited as offering in shaft tombs.<ref name=Olga  />

Shaft Tombs and its offerings:

One of the most representative characteristics of the culture are the shaft tombs, funeral chambers with access through a shaft, hence its name.<ref name=Olga  />  

Construction was normally made by digging on tepetate, with a depth varying depending on the soil hardness; sometimes with steps or a vertical circular duct, with a diameter of 1.20 to 1.40 m, used to reach one, two or three small chambers, resembling a baker's oven, where the offerings were placed next to the deceased.<ref name=Olga  /> 

Offerings could include ceramics with different motifs; men or women in some activity, and testimony of their kind of life (e.g. hunters, musicians, farmers with their belongings and clothing). Could also include parts of everyday use or ornament and their nahual,<ref>The nahual was an animal that could be a parrot, a duck, a snake, but it was usually a dog: these animals popularly became bald dogs or izcuintli, known as the emblem and a very representative figures of Colima, there are similar figures in the mochica culture of Peru.</ref> trip mate to the underworld, disguised as the death God, that leads or guide the soul of the dead through the nine torrents that separate the deceased from heaven.<ref name=Olga  />  

At the end of the funeral ceremony, the tombs were sealed with stone slabs or metates and the shaft filled with dirt. This type of burial chambers appeared during the Mid-Preclassical and the early classical; In addition to western Mexico, these are also found in Colombia.<ref name=Olga  /> 

The disappearance of this funerary tradition, established a change in deity worship, this probably led to the construction of ceremonial centers and plazas, as a result of the arrival of migrants from highlands groups. This is considered, because from the Armeria Phase (500-1000 CE) ceramics features changed and defensive constructions and representations of highland Gods, like Tl<U+00E1>loc and Huehueteotl appeared. During the Chanal phase (600-1500 CE) cities such as El Chanal and La Campana were built, with plazas, platforms, and pyramids built with stones, a characteristic aspect of the area architecture.<ref name=Olga  /> 

===South America===
It is interesting to note the similarities between western Mexico and South America, since in regions of both places shaft tombs were built. Recent studies have found common elements with countries as far away as Colombia, Ecuador and Peru, it is inferred that there was some type of contact perhaps by ocean navigation. Evidence was found in Treasure Beach (200-700 CE), on the Colima coast.<ref name=Olga  />  

The nahual included in tombs, various animal shapes are very similar to those of the mochica culture in Peru.<ref name=Olga  />
