==History==

===2001-02: Early years===
[[File:Mike Shinoda World Expo 2008.jpg|thumb|American multi instrumentalist [[Mike Shinoda]] founded Machine Shop Records in 2001.]]
The label was originally known as The Shinoda Imprint, named after [[Mike Shinoda]].<ref>[http://www.lpassociation.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2610 The Shinoda Imprint] ''[[Linkin Park|LP Association]]''</ref> The label only had the potential to release the [[Extended Play|extended play]]s for the bands fan club annually. Shinoda wanted to release albums of Linkin Park under the label, but the albums were already managed by the parent company [[Warner Bros. Records]], and managing the albums on his alone basis was a difficult job. The first release under the label was for the fan club, ''[[LP Underground 2.0]]'', which was released on November 18, 2002. The label also made available some enhanced features, such as T-shirts, sticker, key-chain, a band picture, guitar pick and membership card. The album was co produced by Don Gilmore with Shinoda. On November 17, 2003, the label released another extended play for the LPU fan club, entitled ''[[LP Underground 3.0]]'', which featured the unreleased songs in the live album ''[[Live in Texas]]'' (which was released on November 18, 2003 through the record label).

===2003-07: Mainstream success===
The label was later renamed to Machine Shop after the involvement of the band members in the work. Brad Delson took over the work as an [[A&R]] representative of the label. The label got the breakthrough success after the release of the overnight recorded collaborative EP by [[Jay-Z]] and Linkin Park, entitled ''[[Collision Course (album)|Collision Course]]'', which was released under the collaboration of labels, [[Roc-A-Fella]], Warner Bros. and Machine Shop. The EP was released on November 30, 2004.<ref>[http://books.google.co.in/books?id=pxQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA55&lpg=PA55&dq=collision+course+machine+shop+records&source=bl&ots=OCs6zTDGGm&sig=CjLaL7TxzNLYm1mgCBI55rmeUms&hl=en&sa=X&ei=fRZCVKflL8HCmQXsmoGgDA&ved=0CEIQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&q&f=false Billboard - 14 May 2005 - Page 55] ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''</ref> The EP was certified as Platinum in America.<ref>{{cite news | title = Ask Billboard: Steve Vai, Jay-Z, Radiohead | last = Trust| first = Gary | author-link =| publisher = ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''| url = http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/267889/ask-billboard-steve-vai-jay-z-radiohead| date = 2009-08-07| accessdate =2009-08-08}}</ref> Later the label signed artists like No Warning, Simplistic and LNDN. ''[[Suffer, Survive]]'' became the first non-Linkin Park album and non shared label album to be released under the label. It was released on October 19, 2004. The album featured only 10 songs. The songs like, ''Dirtier Than the Next'', ''Bad Timing'' and ''Hopeless Case'' gave a breakthrough success to the band and indirectly to the label. On November 18, 2003, the live album by Linkin Park ''[[Live in Texas]]'' was released under the label and Warner Bros; which was also certified as Platinum.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?artist=%22Linkin+Park%22 |title=Gold & Platinum: Linkin Park |publisher=[[Recording Industry Association of America]] |accessdate=June 15, 2014}}</ref> It was also released as a DVD which featured [[Chester Bennington]] breaking Brad Delson's guitar. At the end of the concert, [[Joe Hahn]] threw a piece of his equipment on the stage floor. On November 22, 2005, the label again marked its success on releasing the album ''[[The Rising Tied]]'' by [[Fort Minor]] which was a side project by the founder Shinoda.<ref name="fm"/> Under the success of the album many artists like ''[[Styles of Beyond]]'' and ''[[Holly Brook]]'' were signed in the label.<ref>[http://www.sfexaminer.com/sanfrancisco/skylar-greys-journey-from-being-holly-brook/Content?oid=2178828 Skylar Grey's journey from being Holly Brook]</ref> Holly Brook released two independent EPs ''Holly Brook EP'' and ''Sony CONNECT Sets'' under the label, whereas Styles of Beyond indirectly released singles in which they were featured through the project of Fort Minor. The singles by Fort Minor like [[Petrified/Remember the Name]] gave success to S.O.B. and Fort Minor. The breakthrough single ''[[Where'd You Go (Fort Minor song)|Where'd You Go]]'' featuring Holly Brook marked number four on the [[Billboard Hot 100]] making it the best ever debut song by any ''One-Hit-Wonder''.
