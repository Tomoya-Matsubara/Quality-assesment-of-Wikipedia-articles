[[Sergeant]] '''W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw Grydziuszko''' (1910<U+2013>1946) was a soldier in the [[Polish Army]] during [[World War II]]. He was born on September 6, 1910 in the small rural village of [[Mikulicze]], [[Poland]].<ref name="Grydziuszko">"[http://grydziuszko.googlepages.com/info Grydziuszko, W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw: Paragraph 1 (page 1)]." ''[[RAF]]''. June 2007.</ref> Prior to [[military service]], W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw worked as a master [[tailor]] until he was enlisted with the [[Polish Forces]] in 1939.<ref name="Grydziuszko"/> On August 28, 1939 he was called from [[military reserve|reserve]] and together with the [[Poland|Polish]] [[Police]] unit participated in the 1939 [[Invasion of Poland]] campaign. Grydziuszko was taken [[prisoner of war]] by the former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Red Army]] and was held in the [[USSR]]. Following his ordeal on the basis of the [[Sikorski-Maisky agreement]] of July 30, 1941, W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw Grydziuszko was released for the purpose of joining the [[Polish Armed Forces in USSR]]. From 1942 to 1944 W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw received military training by the [[British Army]] in the [[Middle East]]. Then in 1944 to 1946 he embarked on the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian campaign]].<ref name="Grydziuszko 2">"[http://grydziuszko.googlepages.com/info Grydziuszko, W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw: Theater of Operations (page 2)]." ''[[RAF]]''. June 2007.</ref>

==Battle at Monte Cassino==

Grydziuszko was primarily posted to the Fifth [[Field Artillery]] [[Regiment]], and was later transferred to the Seventh on January 1, 1942.  At [[Monte Cassino]], the [[Polish Army]] was advancing against the [[Hitler Line]],<ref name="Grydziuszko 2"/> and on May 23 the [[Poles]] finally managed to break through attacking the [[village]] of [[Piedimonte San Germano|Piedimonte]]. W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw, along with many other soldiers in the [[2nd Polish Corps]] used [[stables]] and other local buildings to camouflage [[tanks]] and attack the advancing enemy from behind. In the following day the [[5th Canadian (Armoured) Division]] breached the lines and on May, 25 the Poles cleared way for an advance onward to [[Rome]]. W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw Grydziuszko, one of the [[tank]] [[commanders]], was awarded the [[Cross of Valor]] ([[Krzyz Walecznych]]) for showing tremendous [[courage]] on the battlefield.<ref name="Grydziuszko 3">"[http://grydziuszko.googlepages.com/info Grydziuszko, W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw: Medal Entitlement (page 2)]." ''[[RAF]]''. June 2007.</ref> During the battle, Grydziuszko was lightly wounded on October 17, 1944 and suffered minor [[spinal cord]] injuries from [[Nazi]] [[artillery]] fire. However, he quickly recovered and returned to the forces to serve for another two years.
