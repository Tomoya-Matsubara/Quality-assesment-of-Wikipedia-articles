==Concept and description==
[[File:Porsche Panamera 4S (970) <U+2013> Heckansicht, 20. September 2011, W<U+00FC>lfrath.jpg|thumb|left|rear-view]]
[[File:Porsche-Panamera at Porsche-Museum.JPG|thumb|Porsche Panamera in front of the new [[Porsche Museum]]]]
The Panamera's name is derived, like the [[Porsche Carrera]] line, from the [[Carrera Panamericana]] race. The Panamera is generally considered to be the long-awaited fruit of Porsche's [[Porsche 989|989]] [[concept vehicle|concept]] from the late 1980s.

The Panamera is marketed as a more exciting and higher performing alternative to the traditional executive saloons such as the [[BMW 7 Series]], the [[Audi A8]], and the [[Mercedes-Benz S-Class]]. The Panamera competes more directly with cars such as the [[Maserati Quattroporte]], [[Mercedes-Benz CLS-Class]], [[BMW 5 Series Gran Turismo]]<ref name="rankingsandreviews1">{{cite web|url=http://usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/cars-trucks/Porsche_Panamera/ |title=2010 Porsche Panamera Reviews, Prices + Rankings &#124; U.S. News Cars |publisher=Usnews.rankingsandreviews.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.automobilemag.com/reviews/driven/1002_2010_bmw_760li_mercedes_benz_s63_amg_porsche_panamera_turbo_comparison/index.html |title=BMW 760Li, Mercedes-Benz S63 AMG, Porsche Panamera Turbo - Luxury Sport Sedan Comparison - Automobile Magazine |publisher=Automobilemag.com |date=2010-12-13 |accessdate=2011-03-24}}</ref> and [[Aston Martin Rapide]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/lifestyle/review-2012-audi-a7-07262011.html |title=Review: 2012 Audi A7 |publisher=Bloomberg Business Week |date=2011-07-26 |accessdate=2011-11-28}}</ref>

Like the [[Porsche Cayenne]] SUV (which has become the marque's best-selling vehicle), the Panamera upset many Porsche purists, since it was seen as an attempt to broaden Porsche's appeal beyond that of hardcore fans. The Panamera ran contrary to the company's signature offerings, particularly its light two-door rear-engine sports cars like the 911. The Panamera on the other hand is considered a full-size luxury car, weighing nearly {{Convert|4000|lb}}, with four doors, and its engine mounted in the front. The Panamera's appearance with its long hood and rear hatch bears little resemblance to a stretched 911, although it does resemble the 911 from certain angles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cars.com/porsche/panamera/2010/reviews/ |title=2010 Porsche Panamera Reviews by Cars.com Experts and Consumers |publisher=Cars.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-03}}</ref> The iconic 911 has a sparse interior, as it was focused on raw performance, while the Panamera has a sumptuous interior loaded with modern technological amenities and expensive leather upholstery.<ref name="rankingsandreviews1"/><ref name="about1">{{cite web|url=http://cars.about.com/od/porsche/fr/10_panamera.htm |title=2010 Porsche Panamera - Test drive and new car review - 2010 Porsche Panamera |publisher=Cars.about.com |date=2010-06-11 |accessdate=2010-10-03}}</ref>

==Production==
Engines are first assembled in [[Stuttgart]], and the car's [[Coachwork|body]] is built and painted at the [[list of Volkswagen Group factories|Volkswagen Group facility]] in [[Hannover]].  The final assembly of the vehicle takes place in [[Leipzig]], [[Germany]], alongside the [[Porsche Cayenne|Cayenne]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Future: Porsche Panamera|publisher=[[Motor Trend]]|url=http://www.motortrend.com/future/concept_cars/112_0510_2010_porsche_panamera|accessdate=2008-02-02}}</ref>

Production began in April 2009, one month after its debut in the [[Auto Shanghai|Shanghai Motor Show]] in China.<ref name="First official image of Porsche Panamera">{{cite web|last=Kaufmann |first=Alex |url=http://www.motorauthority.com/porsche-panamera-to-start-production-in-april-2009.html |title=Porsche Panamera official details |publisher=Motorauthority.com |date=2008-11-24 |accessdate=2010-10-03}}</ref>

==First generation==
The V8-powered Panamera S, 4S, and Turbo models were the first versions that debuted in 2009. In addition to the 4.8L Twin Turbo {{convert|500|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}  V8, Porsche launched two further models in 2010: the Panamera and Panamera 4 which are both powered by 3.6-litre V6 engines producing {{convert|300|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}. 

Being derived from the V8 engine of the Panamera S and Panamera 4S, the V6 retains the V8's technologies like Direct Fuel Injection, infinitely variable intake camshaft adjustment with variable valve lift (VarioCam Plus), an on-demand oil pump, water cooling with thermal management, a variable intake manifold, as well as integrated dry sump lubrication with two-stage extraction of oil, and an Auto Start-Stop function (only with the PDK transmission).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.porsche.com/usa/aboutporsche/pressreleases/pag/archive2009/quarter1/?pool=international-de&id=2009-01-05 |title=New Panamera: World Debut in China |publisher=Porsche.com |date=2009-01-05 |accessdate=2010-10-03}}</ref> Turbo version uses active aerodynamics with a multi-stage, adjustable rear spoiler.<ref>{{cite web|last=Paukert |first=Chris |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2009/03/18/u-s-porsche-panamera-to-get-start-stop-active-aero-among-other/ |title=U.S. Porsche Panamera to get start/stop, active aero among other features |publisher=Autoblog.com |date=2009-03-18 |accessdate=2010-10-03}}</ref> Optional Sports Chrono Packages include a Sport Plus button, which has tighter damping and air springs, and lowers the car body by {{convert|25|mm|1|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web|last=Abuelsamid |first=Sam |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2009/03/20/porsche-panamera-in-depth-tech-briefing-and-first-ride/ |title=Porsche Panamera: In-depth tech briefing and first ride |publisher=Autoblog.com |date=2009-03-20 |accessdate=2010-10-03}}</ref>

In 2011, the Panamera S Hybrid,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.topgear.com/uk/car-news/porsche-panamera-s-hybrid-announced-2011-02-16 |title=Top Gear 16 February 2011 |publisher=Topgear.com |date=2011-02-16 |accessdate=2012-08-28}}</ref> Diesel,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autocar.co.uk/News/NewsArticle/AllCars/256788/ |title=Autocar 2 May 2011 |publisher=Autocar.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-08-28}}</ref> Turbo S<ref>{{cite web|author=Porsche |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/car-manufacturers/porsche/8416608/Porsche-announces-Panamera-Turbo-S.html |title=Telegraph 30 March 2011 |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-08-28}}</ref> and GTS variants were added to the range.

The Panamera, S, Hybrid and Diesel models are rear-wheel drive, while the Panamera 4, 4S and GTS have the same four-wheel drive system as the Turbo and Turbo S, called Porsche Traction Management (PTM).

===Panamera Diesel===
The Panamera Diesel was launched in May 2011. The vehicle uses the same Audi 3.0L V6 engine used in the Cayenne Diesel, itself a tuned carryover of an existing engine. The Panamera's engine has a power output of {{convert|250|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}. The car is capable of accelerating from 0<U+2013>100&nbsp;km/h in 6.8 seconds and has a top speed of {{convert|242|km/h|mi/h|1|abbr=on}}. It is also the most economical Porsche in the entire vehicle range, consuming just 6.3 liters per 100 kilometers (37 mpg).

===Special Editions===
In October 2012, Porsche introduced the Panamera Platinum Edition. It includes more standard equipment, larger wheels, and an exclusive interior leather combination of luxor beige and black. It will be offered with rear and all wheel drive, and has a {{convert|0|to|60|mph|abbr=on}} time of under 5.8&nbsp;seconds or faster on all variants. Exclusive equipment includes the special interior combination, platinum rear overhang, and front lower grille, platinum door sills, and platinum mirrors. It will be very limited, with most dealers receiving just one or two examples.

==First generation (facelift)==
Porsche announced its updated Panamera on 3 April 2013, with a scheduled formal launch at [[Auto Shanghai]]. The revised model can be identified by new front and rear bumpers and some technical changes included the addition of a new 3.0L twin turbocharged Panamera S and a new E-Hybrid model. A long wheelbase version with an additional 150mm will be available for selected left-hand drive markets, and the Turbo S is scheduled to follow in 2014. Long Wheelbase versions are only available on 4S, Turbo, and Turbo S models.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kew|first=Ollie|title=Porsche Panamera facelift and S E-hybrid (2013) first pictures|url=http://www.carmagazine.co.uk/News/Search-Results/First-Official-Pictures/Porsche-Panamera-facelift-and-S-E-hybrid-2013-first-pictures/|work=Car|accessdate=3 April 2013|date=3 April 2013}}</ref>

===Panamera S E-Hybrid===
As part of the 2013 Panamaera facelift, Porsche announced the introduction of a [[plug-in hybrid]] model, the Panamera S E-Hybrid. Sales are scheduled to begin in Germany in July 2013. The plug-in model will be unveiled at the April 2013 [[Shanghai Auto Show]].<ref name=Ehybrid01>{{cite news|url=http://europe.autonews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20130403/ANE/304039919/porsches-plug-in-panamera-to-start-at-110400-euros#axzz2PhqBloN5|title=Porsche's plug-in Panamera to start at 110,400 euros|author=Douglas A.

The S E-Hybrid is powered by a {{convert|71|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}} electric motor, with a total system power of {{convert|310|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}}. Top speed is {{convert|84|mph|abbr=on}} in [[all-electric mode]], and its time from {{Convert|100|kph|abbr=on}} is 5.2 seconds. The plug-in electric hybrid will have a 9.4 [[kWh]] [[lithium-ion battery]] pack capable of delivering a [[all-electric range|range]] of more than {{convert|20|mi|abbr=on|disp=flip}} under the [[New European Driving Cycle]] (NEDC) standard. The battery can be fully charged in approximately 2<U+00BD> hours from a 240V power source. The Panamera plug-in hybrid reduces fuel consumption to {{Convert|3.1|L/100km|abbr=on}}, down from {{Convert|7.11|L/100km|abbr=on}} for the current Panamera hybrid, which translates to {{co2}} emissions of 71 g/km, down from 167g/km for the current hybrid.<ref name=Ehybrid01/><ref name=Ehybrid02/>

==Reception==
Despite the differences in dimensions and design, a reviewer noted that the Panamera's driving dynamics were close to that of the 911, and it "seems to occupy the no-man's-land between really good [[sports sedan]]s and proper sports cars", and so far the Panamera has won every comparison test against other four-door performance cars on the market such as the [[Maserati Quattroporte]] and [[Aston Martin Rapide]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/comparisons/10q1/porsche_panamera_s_vs._bmw_750i_maserati_quattroporte_sport_gt_s-comparison_tests |title=Porsche Panamera S vs. BMW 750i, Maserati Quattroporte Sport GT S - Comparison Tests - Auto Reviews |publisher=Car and Driver |date= |accessdate=2011-03-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/comparisons/10q2/2010_aston_martin_rapide_vs._2010_porsche_panamera_turbo-comparison_tests |title=2010 Aston Martin Rapide vs. 2010 Porsche Panamera Turbo - Comparison Tests - Auto Reviews |work=Car and Driver |date= |accessdate=2011-03-24}}</ref> Function was also praised, with the {{convert|15.7|cuft|L}} hatchback trunk, and the four-corner adaptive air suspension that retained superior handling while also providing a comfortable ride for public roads. [[Edmunds]] stated that the Panamera was an innovative engineering feat that "makes a unique statement about the way that luxury transportation and serious high-performance potential can be mixed together in one car".<ref name="rankingsandreviews1"/><ref name="about1"/>

Unlike most of the V8-engined contemporaries, all models of the Panamera avoid the US [[Gas Guzzler Tax]]. The V6-powered Panamera was also praised, as its smaller engine still retained respectable acceleration,<ref>{{cite web|last=Neil |first=Dan |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703514904575602783606118798.html#printMode |title=2011 Porsche Panamera 4: The Case of Panamera v. Porsche Purists |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=2010-11-13 |accessdate=2011-03-24}}</ref> and as it had even better handling than its V8 siblings, due to the engine being lighter by {{Convert|100|lb|abbr=on}} which gave the car better weight distribution.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leftlanenews.com/porsche-panamera-v6-first-drive-review.html |title=First Drive: 2011 Porsche Panamera (V6) [Review&#93; |publisher=Leftlanenews.com |date=2010-08-11 |accessdate=2010-10-03}}</ref>

However, ''CAR'' magazine of the U.K. described the S model as lacking sportiness, which they attributed to their test car's being "about as oriented to comfort as it<U+2019>s possible to get"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.carmagazine.co.uk/Drives/Search-Results/First-drives/Porsche-Panamera-S-2009-CAR-review/?content-block=1 |title=Porsche Panamera S (2009) CAR review |date=2009-06-24 |author=Ben Barry |publisher=CAR magazine |accessdate=2010-08-07}}</ref> and called the Turbo model "a missed opportunity on behalf of Porsche" to be "the world<U+2019>s first lightweight four seater" as the top model weighs as much as an Audi S8.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.carmagazine.co.uk/Drives/Search-Results/First-drives/Porsche-Panamera-Turbo-2009-CAR-review/?content-block=1 |title=Porsche Panamera Turbo (2009) CAR review |author=Georg Kacher |date=2009-07-28 |publisher=Car magazine |accessdate=2010-08-07 }}</ref>

The 30 November 2008 edition of [[BBC]]'s ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]'' featured a look at the Panamera in its news section, with the three presenters being very critical of the look. In the June 2009 edition,  [[Richard Hammond]] and [[James May]] were seen driving the Panamera along the A30 in Devon, Great Britain They were racing against a letter sent via [[Royal Mail]] between the [[Isles of Scilly]] and the [[Orkney Islands]]. [[Jeremy Clarkson]] reviewed the Porsche Panamera for an article with ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper and was quite critical.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/driving/jeremy_clarkson/article6877864.ece?token=null&offset=12&page=2 | work=The Times | location=London | title=Porsche Panamera 48 V8 Turbo | first=Jeremy | last=Clarkson | date=2009-10-18 | accessdate=2010-05-22}}</ref>
