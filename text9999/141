The '''Law School of Beirut''' was a center for the study of law in [[classical antiquity]]. It flourished under the patronage of the [[Roman emperor]]s and functioned as the [[Roman Empire]]'s preeminent center of jurisprudence until its destruction in 551&nbsp;CE.<ref name="Jolowicz 1972, p.453">Jolowicz 1972, p.453</ref><ref>Collinet 1925, pp.16<U+2013>31</ref><ref>Sartre 2005, pp.289<U+2013>291</ref>

The law schools of the Roman Empire established organized repositories of imperial constitutions, and institutionalized the study and the practice of jurisprudence to relieve the busy royal courts. Jurisconsults began archiving imperial constitutions, thus facilitating the task of jurists in referring to legal precedents. The origins of the Law School of [[Beirut]] are obscure. The earliest written mention of the school dates to 239 CE, when its reputation had already been established. The school attracted young affluent Roman citizens, and its professors made major contributions to the [[Corpus Juris Civilis|Codex of Justinian]]. The school achieved such wide recognition throughout the empire that Beirut was known as the "Mother of Laws". Beirut was one of the few schools allowed to continue teaching jurisprudence when [[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine Emperor]] [[Justinian I]] shut down other provincial law schools.

The course of study at Beirut lasted for five years and consisted of the revision and analysis of classical juridic texts and imperial constitutions in addition to case discussions. Justinian took a personal interest in the teaching process, and charged the teachers, the bishop of Beirut, and the governor of [[Phoenicia|Phoenicia Maritima]] with maintaining discipline in the school.

The school's facilities were destroyed in the aftermath of a [[551 Beirut earthquake|massive earthquake]] that hit the [[Phoenicia]]n coastline. It was moved to [[Sidon]], but did not survive the [[Muslim conquest of the Levant|Arab conquest]] of 635&nbsp;CE. Ancient texts attest that the school was located next to the ancient Anastasis church, vestiges of which lie beneath the [[Saint George Greek Orthodox Cathedral, Beirut|Saint George Orthodox Cathedral]] in [[Beirut Central District|Beirut's historic center]].

==Background==
In his role as guarantor of justice, the [[Roman emperor]] was expected to devote substantial amounts of time to dealing with judicial matters; he was the [[Executive magistrates of the Roman Empire|chief magistrate]] whose major prerogative ''([[Jus (law)|jus]])'' was the ordering of all public affairs, for which he could demand assistance from anyone at any time.<ref name="Walker 2000 91">Walker 2000, p.91</ref>

In dealing with legal appeals and petitions from subjects, and judicial queries of magistrates and [[Roman governor|governors]], the emperors were careful to consult with the jurisconsults (''iuris consulti'') who were usually secretaries drafted from the [[Roman equestrian order|equestrian order]]. From the reign of [[Augustus]] (27 BCE <U+2013> 14 CE) and onward, jurisconsults began compiling organized repositories of imperial [[edict]]s ''(constitutiones)'', and juristic scholarship became an imperially sponsored function of administration. These archives formed the foundation of every new judicial decision based on the archived [[legal precedent]]s and earlier deliberations. The repositories of edicts and the imperially sponsored juristic scholarship gave rise to the earliest law school system of the [[Western world|Occident]] aimed specifically at training professional jurists.<ref name="Walker 2000 91"/>

==History==
[[File:St. George's Cathedral, Beirut.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A large Byzantine church at the edge of an archaeological field. |St. George's Cathedral sits on the axis of Beirut's ancient [[Cardo Maximus]]. The law school used to be located next to the Byzantine Anastasis church, a precursor of the cathedral.]]
During the reign of [[Augustus]], [[Beirut]] was established under the name ''Colonia Iulia Augusta Felix'' and granted the status of [[Ius Italicum]] as a [[Colonia (Roman)|colony]] for veterans of [[Battle of Actium|Actium]] from the 5th Macedonian and the 3rd Gallic legions. It was chosen as a regional center instead of the more prominent [[Phoenicia]]n cities of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] and [[Sidon]], which had a history of belligerence against Rome.<ref>Jones Hall 2004, pp.46<U+2013>47</ref><ref name="arc">{{cite journal | url=http://archive.archaeology.org/1107/features/beirut_lebanon_urban_archaeology.html | title=Rebuilding Beirut |author=Lawler, Andrew | journal=Archaeology | year=2011 | month=July<U+2013>August | volume=64 | issue=4}}</ref>

Beirut was named as a major center for the study of law and jurisprudence in 239 CE,<ref>Sartre 2005, p.289</ref><ref>Collinet 1925, p.17</ref> in the writings of [[Gregory Thaumaturgus]],<ref group=lower-alpha>In ''Oratio Panegyrica ad Origenem'', Chapter V.</ref> the bishop of [[Niksar|Neo-Caesarea]]. Other early written sources do not mention when the law school was established, and the date is much debated among later historians and scholars. [[Edward Gibbon]] suggested its founding may have been directed by locally born Emperor [[Alexander Severus]], who reigned from 222 to 235.<ref>Gibbon 1854, p.294</ref> In the early 17th century, the Italian jurist [[Scipione Gentili]] attributed the foundation of the school to Augustus, while the later 17th-century French scholar [[Gilles M<U+00E9>nage]] argued for [[Septimius Severus]] (reigned from 193 to 211 CE). In the 19th century, [[Karl Hase]] thought the school was established shortly after the [[Battle of Actium|victory at Actium]] in 31 BCE,<ref>Collinet 1925, pp.16<U+2013>20</ref> Adolf Friedrich Rudorff dated it to the reign of [[Hadrian]],<ref>Rudorff  1857, P.130</ref> and F.P. Bremer suggested that it opened around 200&nbsp;CE, based on the reference in Gregory.<ref>Bremer 1868, p.73</ref>

[[Theodor Mommsen]]<ref group=lower-alpha>Mommsen in ''Die Heimath des Gregorianus''.</ref> linked the establishment of the law school in Beirut with the need for jurists, since the city was chosen to serve as a repository for Roman imperial edicts dealing with the eastern provinces. Imperial ''constitutiones'' arriving in Beirut were translated to [[Ancient Greek|Greek]], published and then archived. This function is first recorded for 196 CE, the date of the earliest constitutions contained in the [[Codex Gregorianus|Gregorian Codex]], but the city is thought to have served as a depository since earlier times.<ref>Mommsen 1901, pp.139<U+2013>144</ref><ref name="Kassir 2010, p.52">Kassir 2010, p.52</ref> The proximity of the repository to the law school gave the Beiruti jurists the opportunity to consult archived edicts and to keep the students updated with the most recent imperial constitutions<U+2014>an advantage that the law schools of [[Caesarea Maritima]] and [[Alexandria]] lacked.<ref>Collinet 1925, p.22</ref>

The 3rd-century emperors [[Diocletian]] and [[Maximian]] issued constitutions exempting the students of the Law School of Beirut from compulsory service in their hometowns.<ref>Collinet 1925, pp.29<U+2013>30</ref> In the 4th century, the Greek rhetorician [[Libanius]] reported that the school attracted young students from affluent families, and deplored the school's instructional use of Latin, which was gradually abandoned in favor of Greek in the course of the century.<ref name="Collinet 1925, p.39">Collinet 1925, p.39</ref>
By the 5th century, Beirut had established its leading position and repute among the empire's law schools; its teachers were highly regarded and played a chief role in the development of juristic learning in the East, to the point that they were dubbed the "Oecumenical Masters".<ref name="Jolowicz 1972, p.453"/><ref>Pomeroy 2012, pp.41<U+2013>42</ref> From 425 onward, [[Constantinople]] became a rival center of law study and was the only school, along with Beirut, to be maintained after [[Justinian I]] closed those of [[Alexandria]], [[Caesarea Maritima]] and [[Athens]] in 529 CE.<ref name="Jolowicz 1972, p.453"/>

On July 9, 551, the [[Phoenicia]]n coastal cities were devastated by a high magnitude [[551 Beirut earthquake|earthquake]]. In Beirut the earthquake was followed by a [[tsunami]] and a fire that obliterated the city. 30,000 people lost their lives, including many students from abroad. Justinian allocated funds to rebuild Beirut, and the law school was temporarily moved to the southern Phoenician city of [[Sidon]], pending reconstruction. The best teachers, however, moved to Constantinople. Misfortune hit Beirut again in 560 CE when a massive fire ravaged the recovering city. The law school was not reopened, and all prospect of its return was abandoned with the [[Muslim conquest of the Levant|Arab conquest]] in 635&nbsp;CE.<ref>Collinet 1925, pp.54<U+2013>58</ref><ref name="Sartre 2005, p.291">Sartre 2005, p.291</ref>

==Academia==
The study course at the Law School of Beirut did not comprise the provincial laws of Phoenica;<ref>Collinet 1925, p.209</ref> it only included Roman law. Ancient texts provide an idea of the curriculum, the teaching method, the course languages and the duration of the study.

===Preparatory studies===
Future students at the Law School of Beirut were expected to have undergone grammar, [[rhetoric]] and encyclopedic sciences studies. Another prerequisite was the mastery of Greek but also of the [[Latin]] language, given that the classical juridic references and the imperial constitutions used in the teaching program were written in Latin. The aspirants could pursue their preparatory studies in public schools or have private tutors.<ref>Collinet 1925, pp.81<U+2013>83</ref>

===Curriculum===
[[File:Meister von San Vitale in Ravenna 004.jpg|thumbnail|alt=Mosaic showing the bust of a severe-looking man wearing a crown and an intricate royal purple tunic.|[[Justinian I]], who instigated the rewriting of Roman law]]
The study of the works of classical jurists and of the imperial constitutions provided the basis of legal education at Beirut's law school. The ''[[Scholia Sinaitica]]'' and the ''[[Scholia]]'' to the ''[[Basilika]]'' give glimpses of the school's [[teaching method]], which is comparable to the one used in the rhetoric schools. Juridic texts were discussed and analyzed, and the lecturer would add his comments, consisting of references to analogous passages from imperial constitutions or from the works of prominent Roman jurists of the like of [[Ulpian]]. He would then formulate the general legal principles and use these to resolve legal problems inspired from actual practical cases. This method differed from the scheme of classical times in which the student had to master the law basics before engaging in case studies in the later part of his education.<ref name="Jolowicz 1972, p.454">Jolowicz 1972, p.454</ref><ref name="Mousourakis 2003, p.363">Mousourakis 2003, p.363</ref><ref>Collinet 1925, p.245</ref>

Jurisprudence was taught in Latin even in the law schools of the East, but towards the end of the 4th and the beginning of the 5th century, Latin was supplanted by [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] at Beirut. A similar shift probably occurred at the school of Constantinople about the same time.<ref name="Collinet 1925, p.39"/><ref name="Jolowicz 1972, p.454"/>

Little is known about the curriculum before the fifth century. Justinian's ''Omnem'' constitution at the beginning of the [[Digest (Roman law)|Digest]] is the only source of information about the existing system of study in the fifth century and up until the Justinian reforms of 533 CE. The old program was a four-year course to be completed before the age of 25. The courses were based on the works of [[Gaius (jurist)|Gaius]], Ulpian, [[Aemilius Papinianus|Papinian]] and [[Julius Paulus Prudentissimus|Paul the jurist]]. Students attended lectures for three years and spent the fourth in private study of Paul's ''[[Responsa]]''; they had the option to stay for a fifth year to study imperial constitutions. The students of each year were distinguished by special names: 1st year, ''Dupondii''; 2nd, ''Edictales''; 3rd, ''Papinianistae''; 4th, ''Lytae''.<ref>Collinet 1925, pp.224<U+2013>240</ref>

After his 533 ''Omnem'' constitution, Justinian I fixed the duration of the legal course in the schools of Beirut and Constantinople at 5 years.<ref name="Corcoran">{{cite web | url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/history2/volterra/julianintro.htm | title=Law-school texts after 533 | publisher=University College London | work=The Epitome of Julian | date=July 20, 2009 | accessdate=March 23, 2013 |author=Corcoran, Simon|authorlink=Simon Corcoran}}</ref><ref name="digest">{{Cite document| last = Flavius Petrus Sabbatius Justinianus Augustus (Justinian I, emperor of the East) | year = 534| place = Constantinople| title = The digest of Justinian|others = Translated by Charles Henry Monro| publisher = Cambridge University Press | publication-date = September 24, 1872|publication-place = Cambridge|url =http://archive.org/stream/digestofjustinia01monruoft/digestofjustinia01monruoft_djvu.txt}}</ref> The courses consisted of taught elements and self-study using materials advanced in his [[Corpus Juris Civilis]], namely the Institutes, Digest and Code.<ref name="Corcoran"/><ref name="digest"/> First-year students were to be lectured on the ''[[Institutiones]]'' and on the first part of the Digest.<ref group=lower-alpha>Books 1 to 5 of the digest called the ''Prota''.</ref> Second-year students were taught the greater part of the Digest.<ref group=lower-alpha>The ''de iudiciis'' (books 5 to 11) and the ''de rebus'' (books 12 to 19) and  the ''libri singularis'': books 23, 26, 28 and 30.</ref> Third-year students had to learn various texts from Papinian and the ''leges singulares''.<ref group=lower-alpha>Books 20 to 22.</ref> There were no lectures during the fourth year of study, but the pupils studied the rest of the Digest up to Book 36.<ref group=lower-alpha>Books 24, 25, 27, 29 and 31 to 36.</ref> The students were still given cognomens according to their year of study but Justinian changed the name of the first-year students from the frivolous ''dupondii'', which means "two-pennies".

At the end of the course, graduands were given certificates allowing them to work as court advocates or in the imperial civil service.<ref name="Mousourakis 2003, p.363"/>

===Professorial body===
Ancient texts reveal the names and deeds of some of the most notable law professors at the Beirut school; the scarce sources include historical accounts, juridic works, anthologies, ancient correspondences and funerary inscriptions.

Rhetoric teacher [[Libanius]] wrote many letters of correspondence to a fourth-century law school professor called Domninus (the Elder). In 360 CE, Libanius attempted to recruit Domninus in the school of Antioch where he taught, but Domninus apparently declined since later letters sent to him by Libanius between 361 and 364 CE served as recommendations for law school candidates.<ref>Collinet 1925, p.121</ref>

The most brilliant era for the Law School of Beirut was that which became known as the era of the Ecumenical Masters (<U+03C4><U+1FC6><U+03C2> <U+03BF><U+1F30><U+03BA><U+03BF><U+03C5><U+03BC><U+03AD><U+03BD><U+03B7><U+03C2> <U+03B4><U+03B9><U+03B4><U+03AC><U+03C3><U+03BA><U+03B1><U+03BB><U+03BF><U+03B9>), spanning a century between 400 and 500 CE. The seven revered masters who were praised and cited by sixth-century scholars are Cyrillus, Patricius, Domninus, Demosthenes, Eudoxius, Leontius and Amblichus.<ref>Collinet 1925, p.131</ref>

[[Cyrillus]] was the founder of the ecumenical school of jurists. He is believed to have taught from 400<U+2013>410 CE to 538 CE. He was styled "the great" because of his reputation as a teacher, and was known for his direct use of ancient sources of law and for interpreting jurists such as Ulpian and Papinian. Cyrillus wrote a precise treatise on definitions (<U+03C5><U+03C0><U+03BF><U+03BC><U+03BD><U+03B7><U+03BC><U+03B1> <U+03C4><U+03C9><U+03BD> <U+03B4><U+03B5><U+03C6><U+03B9><U+03BD><U+03B9><U+03C4><U+03C9><U+03BD>) that supplied the materials for many important scholia appended to the first and second titles of the eleventh book of the [[Basilika|Basilica]].<ref>Encyclopedia Britannica 1911, p.707</ref><ref>Collinet 1925, pp.131<U+2013>132</ref>

[[Patricius (jurist)|Patricius]] is a fifth-century teacher who garnered praise in the third preface of the Justinian Digest (''Tanta-Dedoken'') as a distinguished professor of the Beirut law school. Archaeological excavations done in Beirut at the turn of the 20th century revealed a funerary monument which is believed to belong to the deceased Patricius.<ref>Jalabert 1906, pp.170<U+2013>171</ref><ref>Collinet 1925, pp.132<U+2013>138</ref> Later came Domninus the Younger, Demosthenes and Eudoxius, who were coevals.

[[Leontius (jurist)|Leontius]] was another Ecumenical Master, a son of Eudoxius and the father of Anatolius, who was summoned by the imperial court to assist with the writing of the Justinian Code. [[Zacharias Rhetor]] wrote that Leontius had a great reputation in the legal field; Zacharias was Leontius' student in the first year of his legal course in the year 487 or 488 CE. Leontius was raised to the office of [[Praetorian prefecture of the East|Praetorian prefect of the East]] under [[Anastasius I (emperor)|Anastasius]] between 503 and 504 CE and became [[Magister militum]] in 528 CE. Leontius was also involved as a commissioner in the preparation of the first codex of Justinian.<ref name="Kassir 2010, p.52"/><ref>Collinet 1925, pp.141<U+2013>154</ref>

The last of the Ecumenical Masters was Amblichus, a contemporary of Leontius who wrote about Ulpian's ''Libri ad Edictum''.<ref>Collinet 1925, p.141</ref> Historical sources also tell of Euxenius, a teacher at the Beirut law school who taught during the times of the Ecumenical Masters. Euxenius was the brother of the city's bishop Eustathius and was involved in the 460 CE religious controversy caused by [[Pope Timothy II of Alexandria|Timothy Aelurus]].<ref>Collinet 1925, p.154</ref>

Three school professors who were contemporary to Justinian I are [[Dorotheus (jurist)|Dorotheus]], Anatolius and Julianus.
Dorotheus and Anatolius (the son of Leontius) were summoned to the court of Justinian and commissioned to draft the ''[[Digest (Roman law)|Digesta]]''. Dorotheus also collaborated with Theophilus in drafting the ''[[Institutes of Justinian|Institutiones]]'' under the supervision of  [[Tribonian]].<ref>Collinet 1925, pp.186<U+2013>189</ref> Julianus Antecessor, the last known professor of Beirut, is extolled by Theaetetus as "the light of the law". Julian left Beirut and settled in Constantinople, where he authored the ''[[Novellae Constitutiones|Epitome Iuliani]]'' in 555 CE.<ref>Collinet 1925, pp.190<U+2013>191</ref>

Under Justinian, there were eight teachers in the law schools of the [[Byzantine empire]]; it is presumed that Beirut and Constantinople's schools had 4 teachers each.<ref name="Jolowicz 1972, p.454"/><ref>Collinet 1925, p.211</ref> Justinian mandated the supervision and the enforcement of discipline in the school of Beirut to the teachers, the city's bishop and the [[Praeses|governor]] of [[Phoenicia|Phoenicia Maritima]].<ref name="digest"/><ref>Collinet 1925, p.34</ref>

===Notable students===
According to [[Eusebius| Eusebius of Caesarea]], [[Pamphilus of Caesarea]] was born into a rich family in Beirut in the latter half of the 3rd century and attended its law school. Pamphilus later became the presbyter of [[Caesarea Maritima]] and founder of its extensive Christian library. He is celebrated as a martyr by the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]. Eusebius also tells of [[Aphian]] and his brother [[Aedesius of Alexandria|Aedesius]], born to a noble [[Lycia]]n family. The brothers converted to Christianity while studying law in Beirut and were executed for their beliefs.<ref>Collinet 1925, pp.27<U+2013>30</ref>

Fourth-century historian [[Eunapius]] speaks of a high-ranking official of the Roman empire called [[Anatolius]], known by his enemies as ''Azutrio''.  Anatolius occupied the offices of consul of Syria, [[vicarius]] of the [[Diocese of Asia]], [[proconsul]] of Constantinople, [[List of urban prefects of Constantinople|urban prefect of Constantinople]] in 354 and finally [[Praetorian prefecture of Illyricum|Praetorian prefect of Illyricum]] until his death in 360. Eunapius wrote of Anatolius: "He reached the summit of the science of law. Nothing about this is surprising because Beirut, his homeland, is the mother and nurse of these studies".<ref name="Collinet 1925, p.30<U+2013>32">Collinet 1925, pp.30<U+2013>32</ref><ref>Eunapius 1596, pp.148<U+2013>151</ref>
[[Libanius]]' correspondence with Gaianus of Tyre discusses the latter's achievements after his graduation from the Law School of Beirut. Gaianus became the [[List of Roman governors of Syria#Consularis Governors of Syria Phoenicia (c. 295 AD to c. 395 AD)|consular governor of Phoenicia]] in 362.<ref>Collinet 1925, pp.87<U+2013>88</ref>

[[Gaza]]n lawyer and church historian [[Sozomen]], who was himself a student at Beirut, wrote in his ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' about [[Triphyllius]], a convert to Christendom who became the bishop of Nicosia.  Triphyllius received juridic training in the school at Beirut and was criticized by his teacher [[Saint Spyridon]] for his [[atticism]] and for using legal vocabulary instead of that of the Bible.<ref name="Collinet 1925, p.30<U+2013>32"/>

Ecclesiastical historian [[Zacharias Rhetor]] studied law at Beirut between 487 and 492 and worked as a lawyer in Constantinople for a long time before his good imperial contacts won him the appointment as bishop of [[Mytilene]]. Among Zacharias' works is the biography of [[Severus of Antioch|Severus]], the last [[Monophysitism|monophysite]] patriarch of [[Antioch]] and one of the founders of the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] who also had been a law student in Beirut as of 486.<ref>Collinet 1925, pp.46<U+2013>51</ref> Another late-5th-century student was [[John Rufus]], a vehement anti-[[Chalcedonian Christianity|Chalcedonian]] priest who moved to [[Maiuma]] after the expulsion of his master [[Peter the Fuller]]. In Maiuma, John Rufus authored the ''[[Plerophoriae]]'' and the ''Life of [[Peter the Iberian]]''.<ref>Sterk 2009, p.208</ref><ref name="Collinet 1925, p.51">Collinet 1925, p.51</ref>

==Location==
Historically, Roman ''stationes'' or ''auditoria'' where teaching was done stood next to public libraries housed in temples; this arrangement was copied in the Roman colony at Beirut. The first mention of the school's premises dates to 350 AD,<ref>Collinet 1925, p.62</ref> but the description does not specify its location. In the fifth century, Zacharias Rhetor reported that the school stood next to the "Temple of God", the description of which permitted its identification with the [[Byzantine]] Anastasis cathedral.<ref>Collinet 1925, pp. 63<U+2013>73</ref>

At the turn of the 20th century, archaeological excavations in the [[souk]] between the [[Saint George Greek Orthodox Cathedral, Beirut|Saint George Greek Orthodox cathedral]] and [[Saint George Maronite Cathedral, Beirut|Saint George Cathedral of the Maronites]] unearthed a funerary [[stele]] etched with an epitaph to Patricius, "whose career was consecrated for the study of law". Patricius was identified as the famous 5th-century law school professor.<ref>Collinet 1925, pp. 61<U+2013>73</ref> In 1994, archaeological excavations underneath the Saint George Greek Orthodox Cathedral in [[Beirut Central District]]'s Nejmeh Square identified structural elements of the Anastasis cathedral, but they were restricted to a small area of {{convert|316|m2|sqft}} and failed to unearth the interred school.<ref name="Sartre 2005, p.291"/><ref name="mos">{{cite conference | url=http://books.google.com.lb/books?id=kiwGUQzX00UC&dq=saint+george+orthodox+beirut&source=gbs_navlinks_s | title=Une nouvelle approche pour la pr<U+00E9>servation in situ des mosa<U+00EF>ques et vestiges arch<U+00E9>ologiques au Liban : La crypte de l'<U+00E9>glise Saint-Georges <U+00E0> Beyrouth | publisher=Getty Publications | accessdate=March 21, 2013 | author=Skaf, Isabelle |author2=Makaroun Bou Assaf, Yasmine|editor=A<U+00EF>cha Ben Abed Ben Khader&nbsp;<U+2014> Martha Demas&nbsp;<U+2014> Thomas Roby | booktitle=Lessons Learned: Reflecting on the Theory and Practice of Mosaic Conservation : Proceedings of the 9th ICCM Conference, Hammamet, Tunisia, November 29<U+2013>December 3, 2005 | year=2005|month=December | conference=9th ICCM Conference | location=Hammamet, Tunisia | pages=224<U+2013>229}}{{fr}}</ref><ref>Jones Hall 2004, p.67</ref>

The in-depth studies of the juridic classical works in Beirut and later in Constantinople gave an unprecedented scientific dimension to jurisprudence; this academic movement gave rise to the minds behind Justinian's juridic reforms. As a result of the new understanding of the classical juridic texts, the imperial laws of the late fifth and sixth centuries were more cognizable and of a superior style than those of the early [[Postclassical Era]] according to legal historian George Mousourakis and other scholars.<ref name="Jolowicz 1972, p.451<U+2013>460">Jolowicz 1972, p.451<U+2013>460</ref><ref name="Kunkel">Kunkel 1973, p.146</ref><ref name="Schuz">Schulz 1967, p.267</ref><ref>Mousourakis 2003, p.364</ref>

Two professors from the Law School of Beirut, [[Dorotheus (jurist)|Dorotheus]] and Anatolius were contributors to Tribonian in the writing of the [[Corpus Juris Civilis|Codex of Justinian]],<ref name="digest"/> the empire's body of civil laws that was issued between 529 and 534&nbsp;CE and which profoundly impacted the modern western legal system.<ref>Goodman 1995, p.222</ref>

The school garnered accolades throughout the course of its existence and was bestowed with the title ''Berytus Nutrix Legum'', by [[Eunapius]], [[Libanius]] and [[Zacharias Rhetor]] and finally by [[Justinian I]] himself in his 533&nbsp;CE ''Omnem'' constitution; the constitution reads:<ref name="Collinet 1925, p.51"/>
<blockquote>These three works which we have composed we desire should be put in their hands in royal cities as well as in the most fair city of Berytus, which may well be styled the nursing mother of law, as indeed previous Emperors have commanded, but in no other places which did not enjoy the same privilege in old times, as we have heard that even in the brilliant city of Alexandria, and in Caesarea and others, there have been ignorant men who, instead of doing their duty, conveyed spurious lessons to their pupils, and such as these we desire to make desist from that attempt by laying down the above limits, so that, if they should hereafter be guilty of such conduct and carry on their duties outside the royal cities and the metropolis Berytus, they may be punished by a fine of ten pounds of gold and be expelled from the city in which instead of teaching the law they transgress the law.<ref name="digest"/></blockquote>

From the third century on, the school tolerated and assimilated [[Christianity|Christian]] teachings. It produced a number of students who would become influential church leaders and bishops such as [[Pamphilus of Caesarea]], [[Severus of Antioch]] and [[Aphian]] who, along with his brother [[Aedesius of Alexandria|Edesius]], converted to Christianity during their studies in Beirut. Under Cyrillus, the first of the Ecumenical Masters, the Christian faith was consolidated as an integral element of the jursitic training.<ref name="Kassir 2010, p.53">Kassir 2010, p.53</ref><ref>Attridge  1992, p.436</ref>

The reputation of Beirut as "mother of laws" reemerged in modern times.<ref name="Kassir 2010, p.53"/> In 1913, [[Paul Huvelin]] the first dean of the newly established [[Saint Joseph University|Universit<U+00E9> Saint-Joseph]]'s Faculty of Law, dedicated the inaugural speech to the classical Law School of Beirut in an effort to confer legitimacy to the new academy.<ref name="Kassir 2010, p.53"/><ref name="Kassir 2010, p.199">Kassir 2010, p.199</ref> The epithet ''Berytus Nutrix Legum'' is used as a motto and as part of the emblem of the [[Beirut Bar Association]] which was founded in 1919.<ref name="Kassir 2010, p.53"/> The title also figures as part of the Municipality of Beirut's seal and flag.<ref name="log">{{Cite document| url   =http://beirut.gov.lb/| title = Logo| work  = Municipality of Beirut Logo| publisher  = Municipality of Beirut| accessdate = June 23, 2013}}</ref>
