'''Charlotte Wilhelmine Christiane Marie of Hesse-Darmstadt''' (5 November 1755, [[Darmstadt]] &ndash; 12 December 1785, [[Hanover]]), was by marriage Duchess of [[Mecklenburg-Strelitz]].

== Life ==
Charlotte was a daughter of [[Prince George William of Hesse-Darmstadt]] (1722-1782) from his marriage to [[Maria Louise Albertine of Leiningen-Falkenburg-Dagsburg]] (1729-1818), daughter of Count [[Christian Karl Reinhard of Leiningen-Dachsburg-Falkenburg-Heidesheim]].

The princess was first engaged with the crown prince [[William, Duke of Oldenburg | Peter Frederick William of Oldenburg]], but the engagement was dissolved again as a result of the onset of Peters mental illness.

Charlotte married [[Charles II, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg | Charles of Mecklenburg-Strelitz]] (who later became the Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz), on 28 September 1784 in Darmstadt.  He was previously married with Charlotte's older sister [[Landgravine Friederike of Hesse-Darmstadt | Friederike]], who had died in childbirth.  She thus became stepmother for her sister's five surviving children.

The couple lived in [[Hanover]], where Charles served as [[Governor-general]] for is brother, King [[George III of the United Kingdom | George]].  Charlotte died after the birth of her only child a year after their marriage. Charles resigned from his post in Hanover and moved to Charlotte's mother in Darmstadt.  Charlotte's mother took care of his children (both Frederike's and Charlotte's).

== Offspring ==
Her only child from her marriage to Charles was:
* [[Duke Charles of Mecklenburg | Charles]] (1785-1837), General and President of the Prussian State Council
