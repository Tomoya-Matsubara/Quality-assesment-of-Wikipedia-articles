'''''Drosera viridis''''' is a semi-erect or [[rosette (botany)|rosetted]] [[perennial plant|perennial]] species in the [[carnivorous plant]] genus ''[[Drosera]]''. It is [[endemism|endemic]] to [[Brazil]], being found in eastern [[Paran<U+00E1> (state)|Paran<U+00E1>]] and [[S<U+00E3>o Paulo (state)|S<U+00E3>o Paulo]] and central [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]] at elevations from {{convert|550|-|1100|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}}. It may, however, also be found in adjacent [[Argentina]], [[Paraguay]], and [[Uruguay]]. It typically grows in waterlogged habitats among grasses in white-clayey, reddish [[laterite|lateritic]], or humus-rich black-brown soils and is sometimes found submerged with only the leaves above water.<ref name="Rivadavia 2003">Rivadavia, Fernando. 2003. [http://www.carnivorousplants.org/cpn/articles/CPNv32n3p79_92.pdf Four new species of sundews, ''Drosera'' (Droseraceae), from Brazil.] ''[[Carnivorous Plant Newsletter]]'', 32(3): 79-92.</ref>

''Drosera viridis'' produces carnivorous leaves that are [[leaf shape|spatulate]], about 5 to 28&nbsp;mm long, and entirely green, even when exposed to full sun, unlike the related ''[[Drosera communis|D.&nbsp;communis]]'' whose leaves turn red in full sunlight. Each plant produces one to three erect or ascending [[inflorescence]]s, which are {{convert|7.5|-|30|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} long, including the [[scape (botany)|scape]]. Each inflorescence bears two to twelve light to dark lilac-colored flowers each. It can be found flowering year-round, though more plants are in flower during the wet season from December to March.<ref name="Rivadavia 2003" /> This species has a diploid chromosome number of 2n = 20.<ref name="Rivadavia 2005">Rivadavia, Fernando. 2005.

''Drosera viridis'' is closely related to ''D.&nbsp;communis'' and often occurs in the same regions with it, but ''D.&nbsp;viridis'' is restricted to a more narrow range of wet habitats. Where ''D.&nbsp;viridis'' and ''D.&nbsp;communis'' are [[sympatry|sympatric]], a few specimens have been found that may be hybrids, though they were weak, indicating that the resulting hybrid cross between these two are rare, infertile, and may not reach maturity.<ref name="Rivadavia 2003" />

This species was first described by botanist [[Fernando Rivadavia]] in a 2003 issue of the ''[[Carnivorous Plant Newsletter]]'', along with three other new ''Drosera'' species from Brazil. The [[biological type|type specimen]] was collected by Rivadavia and M. R. F. Cardoso on 2 February 1996.<ref name="IPNI">{{IPNI|id=328317-2|accessdate=|6 August 2011}}</ref> Other specimens were grown under greenhouse conditions for further obervation. Rivadavia chose the specific epithet ''viridis'' to refer to the green color of the plants even when exposed to full sun.<ref name="Rivadavia 2003" />
