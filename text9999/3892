In the [[U.S. state]] of [[Iowa]], '''[[Interstate 29]]''' ('''I-29''') is a north<U+2013>south [[Interstate Highway]] which closely parallels the [[Missouri River]].  I-29 enters Iowa from [[Missouri]] near [[Hamburg, Iowa|Hamburg]] and heads to the north-northwest through the [[Omaha-Council Bluffs metropolitan area|Omaha-Council Bluffs]] and the [[Sioux City, Iowa|Sioux City]] areas.  It exits the state by crossing the [[Big Sioux River]] into [[South Dakota]]. For its entire distance through the state, it runs on the flat land between the Missouri River and the [[Loess Hills]].

I-29 was built in sections over a period of 15 years.  When there was a shortage of male workers, female workers stepped in to build a {{convert|20|mi|adj=on}} section near [[Missouri Valley, Iowa|Missouri Valley]].  Between Council Bluffs and Sioux City, I-29 replaced [[U.S. Route 75]] (US&nbsp;75) as the major route in western Iowa.  As a result of I-29's creation, US&nbsp;75 south of Sioux City was relocated into [[Nebraska]].

==Route description==
Interstate 29 enters Iowa south of [[Hamburg, Iowa|Hamburg]].  The interstate heads northwest, where it meets [[Iowa Highway 333]] (Iowa&nbsp;333) at a [[diamond interchange]].  From Hamburg, I-29 continues to the northwest for {{convert|7|mi}} where it meets [[Iowa Highway 2|Iowa&nbsp;2]] {{convert|3|mi}} east of [[Nebraska City, Nebraska]].  North of the Iowa&nbsp;2 interchange, the interstate straightens out to the north; interchanges serving [[Percival, Iowa|Percival]], [[Thurman, Iowa|Thurman]], and [[Bartlett, Iowa|Bartlett]] are spaced out every {{convert|4+1/2|mi}}.  Near [[Pacific Junction, Iowa|Pacific Junction]], I-29 is [[concurrency (road)|joined]] by [[U.S. Route 34 (Iowa)|US&nbsp;34]] for {{convert|3|mi}}.  At the same interchange where US&nbsp;34 splits away near [[Glenwood, Iowa|Glenwood]], I-29 is joined by [[U.S. Route 275|US&nbsp;275]].<ref name="IowaDOT" />
[[File:Loess hills.jpg|thumb|left|The Loess Hills flank Interstate 29 to the east.|alt=Steep hills loom over a cornfield.]]
North of Glenwood, I-29&nbsp;/ US&nbsp;275 continue north towards [[Council Bluffs, Iowa|Council Bluffs]].  The two routes meet [[Iowa Highway 370|Iowa&nbsp;370]], which crosses into [[Nebraska]] providing access to [[Offutt Air Force Base]] in [[Bellevue, Nebraska]].  Near [[Lake Manawa]], US&nbsp;275 splits away from I-29 at the [[Iowa Highway 92|Iowa&nbsp;92]] interchange.  {{Convert|3/4|mi}} north of the split, the interstate is joined from the east by [[Interstate 80 (Iowa)|Interstate 80]].  The two interstates head west together through southern Council Bluffs for {{convert|3|mi}}.  When the two interstates split at a [[interchange (road)|Y interchange]], I-80 immediately crosses the [[Missouri River]] into Nebraska, and I-29 immediately turns to the north.  Two miles (3.2&nbsp;km) to the north is a modified Y interchange with [[U.S. Route 6 (Iowa)|US&nbsp;6]] and the eastern end of [[Interstate 480 (Iowa)|I-480]].<ref name="IowaDOT" />

North of Council Bluffs, I-29 is joined by [[Interstate 680 (Iowa)|I-680]] near [[Crescent, Iowa|Crescent]].  The two interstates travel north together for {{convert|9|mi}} before I-680 splits off to the east near [[Loveland, Iowa|Loveland]].  I-29 continues north for {{convert|4|mi}} to [[Missouri Valley, Iowa|Missouri Valley]], where it intersects [[U.S. Route 30 (Iowa)|US&nbsp;30]].  North of Missouri Valley, the interstate turns to the northwest towards [[Modale, Iowa|Modale]] and then straightens out again south of [[Mondamin, Iowa|Mondamin]], where I-29 meets the western end of [[Iowa Highway 127|Iowa&nbsp;127]].  From Mondamin, it travels north for {{convert|23|mi}} to the [[Iowa Highway 175|Iowa&nbsp;175]] interchange at [[Onawa, Iowa|Onawa]], passing [[Little Sioux, Iowa|Little Sioux]] and [[Blencoe, Iowa|Blencoe]].<ref name="IowaDOT" />
[[File:Missouri-Floyd Rivers Sioux City Iowa.jpg|thumb|left|Interstate 29 closely parallels the Missouri River in Sioux City.|alt=A major highway crosses a minor river which flows into a large river.]]
North of Onawa, I-29 continues northwest for {{convert|15|mi}} towards [[Sloan, Iowa|Sloan]], where it meets the western end of [[Iowa Highway 141|Iowa&nbsp;141]].  As it approaches the [[Sioux City, Iowa|Sioux City]] [[metro area]], it passes the [[Sioux Gateway Airport]] at [[Sergeant Bluff, Iowa|Sergeant Bluff]].  At the Singing Hills Boulevard interchange, northbound is joined by southbound [[Iowa Highway 376|U.S. Route 75 Business]] (US&nbsp;75&nbsp;Bus.).  One mile (1.6&nbsp;km) later, US&nbsp;75&nbsp;Bus. ends at the [[cloverleaf interchange]] with [[U.S. Route 20 (Iowa)|US&nbsp;20]]&nbsp;/ [[U.S. Route 75 (Iowa)|US&nbsp;75]], which is also the eastern end of [[Interstate 129]].<ref name="IowaDOT" />

For the next {{convert|3|mi}} north of the I-129 interchange, I-29 runs closely, as close as {{convert|200|ft}}, to the Missouri River.  The interstate follows the curve of the river and turns to the west.  It meets Gordon Drive, which carries [[U.S. Route 20 Business (Sioux City, Iowa)|US&nbsp;20&nbsp;Bus.]]  US&nbsp;20&nbsp;Bus. traffic is directed onto the interstate for {{convert|1/2|mi}} before it exits via a [[volleyball interchange]] which represents the national northern end of [[U.S.&nbsp;Route&nbsp;77]].<ref name="IowaDOT" />  I-29 continues west along the Missouri River, and after the [[Big Sioux River]] converges into the Missouri, I-29 follows the Big Sioux.  Shortly before it crosses the Big Sioux into [[South Dakota]], [[Iowa Highway 12|Iowa&nbsp;12]] splits away to the north.<ref name="Sioux City inset">{{cite map|publisher=Iowa Department of Transportation|title=Sioux City, Iowa|url=http://www.iowadotmaps.com/msp/pdf/current/siouxcty.pdf|accessdate=September 8, 2010|year=2010}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Corp_of_Eng._6-16-11A_219.jpg|thumb|Interchange with 680 looking toward the Mormon Bridge in Council Bluffs on June 16, 2011 during the [[2011 Missouri River floods]]]]
Construction of Interstate 29 began in the late 1950s in the Sioux City area.  The first section to open, a {{convert|3|mi|adj=on}} long stretch from the [[Big Sioux River]] to the then-[[U.S. Route 20 (Iowa)|US&nbsp;20]]&nbsp;/ [[U.S. Route 77|US&nbsp;77]] bridge across the [[Missouri River]], opened around October 1, 1958.  In September 1961, I-29 was extended across the Big Sioux River to [[South Dakota]].  On April 1, 1962, one of the directional spans collapsed {{convert|4|ft}} as a result of flooding, but did not fall into the river.<ref name="Lodi">{{cite news|agency=[[United Press International]]|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=dXBh7-90p_YC&dat=19620402&printsec=frontpage|title=Rain, storms follow weekend of storms; stir fears of floods|date=April 2, 1962|work=[[Lodi News-Sentinel]]|page=5|accessdate=September 8, 2010}}</ref>

North of [[Council Bluffs, Iowa|Council Bluffs]], a {{convert|20|mi|adj=on}} section to [[Missouri Valley, Iowa|Missouri Valley]] opened in November 1958.  By December 1967, the two sections were connected, creating {{convert|100|mi}} of continuous interstate highway.<ref name="Completion map" />  Due to a shortage of male workers, at least 20 women were enlisted to help build this section of I-29.  The women were paid $2.00 hourly (${{formatprice|{{inflation|US|2|1967}}}} hourly in {{CURRENTYEAR}} dollars{{Inflation-fn|US}}), the same wage as men would have earned.<ref name="Toledo">{{cite news|agency=[[Associated Press]]|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=uPEvAAAAIBAJ&sjid=hwEEAAAAIBAJ&pg=1999,5757083&hl=en|title=Can't get men, paving contractor is hiring women|date=October 13, 1967|work=[[Toledo Blade]]|page=5|accessdate=September 8, 2010}}</ref>

Construction of I-29 in the Council Bluffs area was completed in 1970 and the route was open to [[Glenwood, Iowa|Glenwood]] in the same year.  Additional interchanges were added in the Sioux City and Council Bluffs areas between 1970 and 1971.  The last {{convert|30|mi}} of interstate were constructed and opened in sections over the next two years; the last section opened on December 15, 1972.<ref name="Completion map" />

In 1973, [[U.S. Route 34 (Iowa)|US&nbsp;34]] was expanded to four lanes near Glenwood, which resulted in US&nbsp;34 being rerouted onto I-29 for {{convert|3|mi}}.<ref name="Completion map" />  In 2003, [[U.S. Route 275|US&nbsp;275]] was rerouted onto I-29 from the same interchange near Glenwood northward to [[Iowa Highway 92|Iowa&nbsp;92]] at Council Bluffs.  The former US&nbsp;275 alignment was [[decommissioned highway|turned over]] to [[Mills County, Iowa|Mills]] and [[Pottawattamie County, Iowa|Pottawattamie Counties]].<ref name=DOT2004>{{cite map|publisher=Iowa Department of Transportation|url=http://www.iowadotmaps.com/msp/historical/pdf/2004_front.pdf|title=Iowa State Highway Map|year=2004|section=B2|accessdate=September 8, 2010}}</ref>

Much of I-29 was built next to existing highways, most notably [[U.S. Route 75 (Iowa)|US&nbsp;75]].  When the section of I-29 opened between Council Bluffs and Missouri Valley, US&nbsp;75 was rerouted onto I-29.<ref name=DOT1959>{{cite map|publisher=[[Iowa State Highway Commission]]|url=http://www.iowadotmaps.com/msp/historical/pdf/1959_front.pdf|title=Iowa State Highway Map|year=1959|section=L2:M3|accessdate=September 8, 2010}}</ref>  When construction connecting the Sioux City and Council Bluffs segments was completed, US&nbsp;75 was again rerouted onto I-29.<ref name=DOT1969>{{cite map|publisher=Iowa State Highway Commission|url=http://www.iowadotmaps.com/msp/historical/pdf/1969_front.pdf|title=Iowa State Highway Map|year=1969|section=G1:L3|accessdate=September 8, 2010}}</ref>  In the mid-1980s, US&nbsp;75, from Council Bluffs to Sioux City, was completely rerouted out of Iowa, instead extending up the former [[U.S. Route 73 (Nebraska)|US&nbsp;73]] corridor in [[Nebraska]].<ref name=DOT1985>{{cite map|publisher=Iowa Department of Transportation|title=Iowa State Highway Map|year=1985|section=A5:B3}}</ref>
