'''The Metacomet Ridge''' or '''Metacomet Range''' of southern [[New England]] is a narrow and steep [[fault-block]] mountain ridge known for its extensive cliff faces, scenic vistas, [[microclimate]] ecosystems, and communities of plants considered rare or endangered. An important recreation resource located within {{convert|10|mi|km}} of a population corridor of over 2.5 million people, the ridge is home to four long distance [[hiking]] trails and over a dozen parks and recreation areas including several state and nationally recognized historic sites. Because of its natural, historic, and recreational value, the ridge has been the focus of ongoing conservation efforts involving municipal, state, and national agencies as well as nearly two dozen [[non-profit organization]]s.<ref name="EF">Farnsworth, Elizabeth J.

The Metacomet Ridge extends from [[Long Island Sound]] in southern [[New Haven County, Connecticut]], through the [[Connecticut River Valley]] region of [[Massachusetts]], to northern [[Franklin County, Massachusetts|Franklin County]], {{convert|2|mi|km}}, short of the [[Vermont]] and [[New Hampshire]] borders, a distance of {{convert|100|mi|km}}. Younger and geologically distinct from the nearby [[Appalachian Mountains]] and surrounding uplands, the Metacomet Ridge is composed of volcanic [[basalt]], also known as ''traprock'', and [[sedimentary rock]] in faulted and tilted layers many hundreds of feet thick. In most, but not all cases, the basalt layers are dominant, prevalent, and exposed. Although only {{convert|1200|ft|m}} above sea level at its highest, with an average summit elevation of {{convert|725|ft|m}}, the Metacomet Ridge rises dramatically from much lower valley elevations, making it a prominent landscape feature.<ref name="EF"/><ref name="DeLorme">''DeLorme Topo 6.0'' (2006).

==Geography==
[[Image:Farmingtonriver gorge.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Farmington River]] cuts the Metacomet Ridge in [[Simsbury, Connecticut]]]]Beginning at [[Long Island Sound]], the Metacomet Ridge commences as two parallel ridges with related sub-ridges and outcrops in between, most notably the high [[butte]]<U+2013>like cliffs of [[East Rock]] and the isolated peak of [[Peter's Rock]].

North of the Holyoke Range, the apparent ridgeline of the Metacomet Ridge is broken by a discontinuity in the once dominant traprock strata. Underlying sedimentary layers remain but lack the same profile. Between the Holyoke Range and the [[Pocumtuck Ridge]], a {{convert|9|mi|km}} stretch, the Metacomet Ridge exists only as a series of mostly nondescript rises set among flat plains of sedimentary bedrock.

==Geology==
[[Image:Hanging Hills.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Faulted and tilted layer of traprock strata visible from left to right. The [[Hanging Hills]] of [[Meriden, Connecticut]].]] [[Image:Ct farmington quarry.jpg||left|thumb|120px|Traprock layer above; sedimentary layer beneath. Defunct quarry, Plainville Connecticut]][[Image:Bare mountain talus.jpg|thumb|right|Talus slope on [[Bare Mountain (Massachusetts)|Bare Mountain]] of the Holyoke Range, Massachusetts]] 
The Metacomet Ridge is the result of [[rift|continental rifting]] processes that took place 200 million years ago during the [[Triassic]] and [[Jurassic]] periods. The [[basalt]] (also called traprock) crest of the Metacomet Ridge is the product of a series of massive [[lava]] flows hundreds of feet deep that welled up in faults created by the rifting apart of the [[North America]]n continent from [[Eurasia]] and [[Africa]]. Essentially, the area now occupied by the Metacomet Ridge is a prehistoric [[rift valley]] which was once a branch of (or a parallel of) the major rift to the east that become the [[Atlantic Ocean]].<ref name="Raymo"/>  

Basalt is an [[extrusive]] [[volcanic rock]], dark in color, but the [[iron]] within it weathers to a rusty brown when exposed to the air, lending it a distinct reddish or purple<U+2013>red hue. Basalt frequently breaks into octagonal and pentagonal columns, creating a unique "postpile" appearance. Extensive slopes made of fractured basalt [[Scree|talus]] are visible at the base of many of the cliffs along the Metacomet Ridge.<ref name="Raymo"/> 
 
The basalt floods of lava that now form much of the Metacomet Ridge took place over 20 million years. [[Erosion]] and [[Deposition (geology)|deposition]] occurring between the eruptions deposited layers of sediment between the lava flows, some of it several miles thick, which eventually lithified into [[sedimentary rock]]. The resulting "layer cake" of basalt and sedimentary rock eventually faulted and tilted upward (see [[fault-block]]). Subsequent erosion wore away many of the weaker sedimentary layers at a faster rate than the basalt layers, leaving the abruptly tilted edges of the basalt sheets exposed, creating the distinct linear ridge and dramatic cliff faces visible today.<ref name="Raymo"/> It is possible to envision this by imagining a layer cake tilted slightly up with some of the frosting (the sedimentary layer) removed in between. Evidence of this layer-cake structure is visible on [[Mount Norwottuck]] of the [[Holyoke Range]] in Massachusetts. The summit of Norwottuck is made of basalt; directly beneath the summit are the Horse Caves, a deep overhang where the weaker sedimentary layer has worn away at a more rapid rate than the basalt layer above it. [[Sugarloaf Mountain (Franklin County, Massachusetts)|Mount Sugarloaf]], [[Pocumtuck Ridge]], and [[Mount Toby]], also in Massachusetts, together present a larger "layer cake" example. The bottom layer is composed of ''[[arkose|arkose sandstone]],'' visible on Mount Sugarloaf. The middle layer is composed ''[[basalt|volcanic traprock]],'' most visible on the Pocumtuck Ridge. The top layer is composed of a sedimentary [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]] known as ''Mount Toby Conglomerate.'' Faulting and [[earthquake]]s during the period of continental rifting tilted the layers diagonally; subsequent erosion and glacial activity exposed the tilted layers of sandstone, basalt, and conglomerate visible today as three distinct mountain masses. Although Mount Toby and Mount Sugarloaf are not composed of [[traprock]], they are part of the Metacomet Ridge by virtue of their origin via the same rifting and uplift processes.<ref name="Toby"/>

Of all the summits that make up the Metacomet Ridge, [[West Rock]], in [[New Haven, Connecticut]], bears special mention because it was not formed by the volcanic flooding that created most of the traprock ridges. Rather, it is the remains of an enormous [[dike (geology)|volcanic dike]] through which the basalt lava floods found access to the surface.<ref name="Raymo"/>

While the traprock cliffs remain the most obvious evidence of the prehistoric ''geologic'' processes of the Metacomet Ridge, the sedimentary rock of the ridge and surrounding terrain has produced equally significant evidence of prehistoric life in the form of Triassic and Jurassic [[fossil]]s, in particular, [[dinosaur]] tracks. At one site in [[Rocky Hill, Connecticut]], more than 2,000 well preserved late Jurassic prints have been excavated.<ref>[http://www.dinosaurstatepark.org/ Dinosaur State Park]. Friends of Dinosaur State Park. Retrieved December 23, 2007.</ref> Other sites in Holyoke and Greenfield have likewise produced significant finds.<ref name="Raymo"/><ref>[http://www.thetrustees.org/pages/298_dinosaur_footprints.cfm "Dinosaur Footprints"] [[The Trustees of Reservations]].

==Ecosystem==
[[Image:Agkistrodon contortrix mokasen CDC.png|left|thumb|120px|Northern copperhead]] The Metacomet Ridge hosts a combination of [[microclimate]]s unusual to the region. Dry, hot upper ridges support [[oak savanna]]s, often dominated by [[chestnut oak]] and a variety of understory grasses and ferns. [[Juniperus virginiana|Eastern red cedar]], a dry-loving species, clings to the barren edges of cliffs. Backslope plant communities tend to be similar to the adjacent upland plateaus and nearby [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachians]], containing species common to the [[northern hardwood forest|northern hardwood]] and [[oak-hickory forest]] ecosystem types. [[Tsuga canadensis|Eastern hemlock]] crowds narrow ravines, blocking sunlight and creating damp, cooler growing conditions with associated cooler climate plant species. Talus slopes are especially rich in nutrients and support a number of calcium-loving plants uncommon in the region. Miles of high cliffs make ideal [[Bird of prey|raptor]] habitat, and the Metacomet Ridge is a seasonal raptor migration corridor. [[Image:Ram's-Head Lady's-Slipper (Cypripedium arietinum).jpg|thumb|right|100px|Ram's-head lady's slipper]]Because the topography of the ridge offers such varied terrain, many species reach the northern or southern limit of their range on the Metacomet Ridge; others are considered rare nationally or globally. Examples of rare species that live on the ridge include the [[prickly pear|prickly pear cactus]], [[peregrine falcon]], [[Agkistrodon contortrix mokasen|northern copperhead]], [[Cypripedium reginae|showy lady's slipper]], [[Corydalis lutea|yellow corydalis]], [[Cypripedium arietinum|ram<U+2019>s<U+2013>head lady's slipper]], [[Pycnanthemum clinopodioides|basil mountain mint]], and [[Chamaelirium luteum|devil's bit lilly]].<Ref name="EF"/><ref>[http://www.umass.edu/landeco/teaching/ecosystem_management/schedule/toby/tobyscenario.pdf "Mount Toby Ecosystem.<U+201D>] (Undated) The Mount Toby Partnership.

==History==
===Pre-colonial era===
[[Image:Giant-beaver-fieldmuseum.jpg|thumb|left|120px|A prehistoric giant beaver species may have been the basis of the Pocumtuck legend]][[Native Americans (United States)|Native Americans]] occupied the river valleys surrounding the Metacomet Ridge for at least 10,000 years. Major tribal groups active in the area included the [[Quinnipiac]], [[Niantic (tribe)|Niantic]], [[Pequot]], [[Pocomtuc]], and [[Mohegan]]. [[Traprock]] was used to make tools and arrowheads. Natives hunted game, gathered plants and fruits, and fished in local bodies of water around the Metacomet Ridge. Tracts of woodland in the river bottoms surrounding the ridges were sometimes burned to facilitate the cultivation of crops such as [[Maize|corn]], [[Squash (plant)|squash]], [[tobacco]], and [[bean]]s.<ref name="EF"/><ref name="Cronin">Cronin, William (2003). ''Changes in the Land: Indians, Colonists, and the Ecology of New England.'' New York: Hill and Wang.</ref> 
Native beliefs incorporated the natural features of the ridgeline and surrounding geography. Many Native American stories were in turn incorporated into regional colonial folklore. The giant stone spirit Hobbomock (or Hobomock), a prominent figure in many stories, was credited with diverting the course of the [[Connecticut River]] where it suddenly swings east in [[Middletown, Connecticut]] after several hundred miles of running due south. Hobbomuck is also credited with slaying a giant human-eating [[beaver]] who lived in a great lake that supposedly existed in the [[Connecticut River Valley]] of Massachusetts. According to native beliefs as retold by European settlers, the corpse of the beaver remains visible as the Pocumtuck Ridge portion of the Metacomet Ridge. Later, after Hobbomuck diverted the course of the Connecticut River, he was punished to sleep forever as the prominent man-like form of the [[Sleeping Giant (Connecticut)|Sleeping Giant]], part of the Metacomet Ridge in southern Connecticut. There seems to be an element of scientific truth in some of these tales. For instance, the great lake that the giant beaver inhabited may very well have been the post-glacial [[Lake Hitchcock]], extant 10,000 years ago, and the giant beaver may have been an actual prehistoric species of bear<U+2013>sized beaver, [[Giant beaver|''Castoroides ohioensis'']], that lived at that time.<ref>Field, Phinehas (1870<U+2013>79).

===Colonization, agricultural transformation, and industrialization===
[[Image:Charcoal pile 05.jpg|thumb|left|160px|Wood prepared for charcoal burning]][[European ethnic groups|European]]s began settling the river valleys around the Metacomet Ridge in the mid<U+2013>1600s. Forests were cut down or burned to make room for agriculture, resulting in the near complete denuding of the once contiguous forests of southern New England by the 1800s. Steep terrain like the Metacomet Ridge, while not suitable for planting crops, was widely harvested of timber as a result of the expanding [[charcoal]] industry that boomed before the mining of [[coal]] from the mid<U+2013>Appalachian regions replaced it as a source of fuel. In other cases, ridgetop forests burned when lower elevation land was set afire, and some uplands were used for pasturing.<ref name="EF"/><ref name="Cronin"/> Traprock was harvested from [[Scree|talus]] slopes of the Metacomet Ridge to build house foundations;<ref name="EF"/> copper ore was discovered at the base of [[Peak Mountain]] in northern Connecticut and was mined by prisoners incarcerated at [[Old Newgate Prison]] located there.<ref>[http://www.cultureandtourism.org/cct/cwp/view.asp?a=2127&q=302258 Connecticut Commission on Culture and Tourism]. Retrieved December 22, 2007.</ref> 

With the advent of [[industrialization]] in the 1800s, riverways beneath the Metacomet Ridge were dammed to provide power as the labor force expanded in nearby cities and towns. Logging to provide additional fuel for mills further denuded the ridges. Traprock and sandstone were quarried from the ridge for paving stones and architectural [[brownstone]], either used locally or shipped via rail, barge, and boat.<ref name="EF"/><ref name="Cronin"/><ref>Bass, Sharon (March 26, 1989).

===Suburbanization and land conservation===
[[Image:Suffield Mountain forsale.jpg|thumb|right|120px|"Mountain Property For Sale" on [[West Suffield Mountain]]]]Although the Metacomet Ridge has abutted significant urban areas for nearly two hundred years, because of its rugged, steep, and rocky terrain, the ridge was long considered an undesirable place to build a home except for those wealthy enough to afford such a luxury. However, [[suburbanization]] through [[urban exodus]] and [[Effects of the automobile on societies|automobile culture]], and modern construction techniques and equipment have created a demand for homes on and around the once undeveloped Metacomet Ridge and its surrounding [[exurban]] communities.<ref name="EF"/> As of 2007, the metropolitan areas bordering the range<U+2014>[[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]], [[Meriden, Connecticut|Meriden]], [[New Britain, Connecticut|New Britain]], [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]], [[Springfield, Massachusetts|Springfield]] and [[Greenfield, Massachusetts|Greenfield]]<U+2014>had a combined population of more than 2.5 million people.<ref name="census"/> Populations in exurban towns around the range in Connecticut have increased 7.6 percent between the mid-1990s to 2000, and building permits increased 26 percent in the same period. Considered an attractive place to build homes because of its views and proximity to urban centers and highways, the Metacomet Ridge has become a target for both developers and advocates of [[Conservation movement|land conservation]]. Quarrying, supported by the increased need for stone in local and regional construction projects, has been especially damaging to the ecosystem, public access, and visual landscape of the ridge.<ref name="EF"/> At the same time, the boom in interest in outdoor recreation in the latter 20th century has made the Metacomet Ridge an attractive "active leisure" resource. In response to public interest in the ridge and its surrounding landscapes, more than twenty local non-profit organizations have become involved in conservation efforts on and around the ridge and surrounding region. Most of these organizations came into being between 1970 and 2000, and nearly all of them have evidenced a marked increase in conservation activity since 1990.<ref>Regional examples include: [http://www.bethanylandtrust.org/ Bethany Land Trust], [http://www.branfordlandtrust.org/ Branford Land Trust], [http://berlinlandtrust.org/ Berlin Land Trust], [http://www.simsburylandtrust.org/ Simsbury Land Trust], [http://www.orgsites.com/ct/slc/ Suffield Land Conservancy], [http://www.thetrustees.org/ The Trustees of Reservations],<br />

==Recreation==
[[Image:Eastrock01.jpg|thumb|460px|left|[[East Rock]] of New Haven, Connecticut]] Steepness, long cliff<U+2013>top views, and proximity to urban areas make the Metacomet Ridge a significant regional outdoor recreation resource.<ref name="EF"/> The ridge is traversed by more than 200 mi (322 km) of long-distance and shorter [[hiking]] trails. Noteworthy trails in Connecticut include the {{convert|51|mi|km}}  [[Metacomet Trail]], the {{convert|50|mi|km}} [[Mattabesett Trail]], the {{convert|23|mi|km}} [[Quinnipiac Trail]], and the {{convert|6|mi|km}} [[Regicides Trail]].

Site<U+2013>specific activities enjoyed on the ridge include [[rock climbing]], [[bouldering]], [[fishing]], [[boating]], [[hunting]], [[swimming]], [[backcountry skiing]], [[cross-country skiing]], [[trail running]], [[cycling|bicycling]], and [[mountain biking]]. Trails on the ridge are open to [[Snowshoe|snowshoeing]], [[birdwatching]] and [[picnic|picnicking]] as well. The Metacomet Ridge hosts more than a dozen state parks, reservations, and municipal parks, and more than three dozen nature preserves and conservation properties. Seasonal automobile roads with scenic vistas are located at [[Pocumtuck Range|Poet's Seat Park]], [[Mount Sugarloaf State Reservation]], [[J.A. Skinner State Park]], the [[Mount Tom State Reservation]], [[Hubbard Park]], and [[West Rock Ridge State Park]]; these roads are also used for bicycling and cross<U+2013>country skiing. [[Camping]] and [[campfire]]s are discouraged on most of the Metacomet Ridge, especially in Connecticut. Museums, historic sites, [[interpretive centre|interpretive center]]s, and other attractions can be found on or near the Metacomet Ridge; some offer outdoor concerts, celebrations, and festivals.<ref name="M&M"/><ref name="CWB"/><ref name=DCR">[http://www.mass.gov/dcr/ Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation].

==Conservation==
[[Image:Round Mountain Quarry.jpg|right|thumb|180px|Obliteration of Round Mountain by quarrying. 1989 photo; significantly more rock has been removed since then.]]
Because of its narrowness, proximity to urban areas, and fragile ecosystems, the Metacomet Ridge is most endangered by encroaching [[suburban sprawl]]. [[Quarry]] expansion is also a threat; quarrying operations have obliterated several square miles of traprock ridgeline in both Massachusetts and Connecticut. Ridges and mountains affected include [[Trimountain]], [[Bradley Mountain]], [[Totoket Mountain]], [[Chauncey Peak]], [[Rattlesnake Mountain (Connecticut)|Rattlesnake Mountain]], [[East Mountain (Hampden County, Massachusetts)|East Mountain]], [[Pocumtuck Ridge]], and the former Round Mountain of the [[Holyoke Range]].<Ref name="EF"/><ref name="DeLorme"/><Ref name="GE">''[[Google Earth]].''

Development and quarrying threats to the Metacomet Ridge have resulted in public open space acquisition efforts through collective purchasing and fundraising, active solicitation of land donations, securing of [[conservation easement]]s, protective and restrictive legislation and agreements limiting development, and, in a few cases, land taking by [[eminent domain]].<ref name="EF"/><ref name="CT"/><Ref name="Chronos"/><ref name="TT">[http://www.thetrustees.org/pages/337_mount_tom.cfm "Mount Tom: Defining the Landscape of the Connecticut River Valley."] [[The Trustees of Reservations]].
