'''Marty Mayberry''' (born 9 February 1986) is a double leg amputee [[LW3 (classification)|LW3 classified]] Paralympic alpine skier from Australia. He lost both legs after contracting [[meningococcal disease]] when he was sixteen years old. His experiences led him to study medicine, and he attended [[Griffith University]] and the [[University of Sydney]] where he pursued health science courses. Beyond the classroom, he has written a paper on Meningococcal disease, worked part-time on research about the disease, and talked about his experiences at a conference.  While at a music festival, he met his future wife whom he married in June 2010.

Having started out as an able-bodied skier, Mayberry took up the disability sport. He made his national team debut in 2005, and went on to represent Australia at the [[2006 Winter Paralympics]] the following year, when he did not medal.  With the aid of a prosthesis, adjustments were made to his skiing legs, and he competed in several skiing competitions during 2007, 2008 and 2009. He was selected for the Australian [[2010 Winter Paralympics]] team at a ceremony in [[Canberra]] in November 2009. Between then and the start of the Games, he participated in a few more competitions, including one where he picked up a gold medal, and participated in a national team training camp.  He was selected as Australia's flag bearer for the opening ceremony.  In competition, he earned a silver medal in the men's [[downhill]] standing event, finished 24th in the [[Super-G]], was disqualified from the [[slalom]], and failed to finish in the [[giant slalom]].  Following the games, he retired from skiing.
