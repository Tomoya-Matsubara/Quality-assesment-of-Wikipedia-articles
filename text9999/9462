"'''River Deep - Mountain High'''" is a 1966 single by [[Ike & Tina Turner]]. Considered by producer [[Phil Spector]] to be his best work,<ref>Ribowsky, Mark. ''He's A Rebel.'' Cambridge, MA: Perseus, 2007.</ref> the single was successful in [[Europe]], peaking at #3 in the [[United Kingdom]], though it flopped on its original release in the [[United States]].  Spector claimed to be pleased with the response from the critics and his peers,<ref name=pc21/> but he then withdrew from the [[music industry]] for two years, beginning his personal decline. 

After [[Eric Burdon]] covered the song in [[1968]], it was re-released a year later, and has since become one of Tina Turner's signature songs.

==Recording and release==
Written by Spector, [[Jeff Barry]], and [[Ellie Greenwich]], "River Deep - Mountain High" was among the first recordings that [[Ike & Tina Turner]] did for Phil Spector's [[Philles Records]]. Spector was well aware of [[Ike Turner]]'s controlling attitude in the studio, and resultantly drew up an unusual contract: the ''River Deep <U+2013> Mountain High'' album and single would be credited to "Ike & Tina Turner", but Ike was paid $20,000 to stay away from the studio, and only [[Tina Turner]]'s vocals would be used on record.<ref>Richard Williams, {{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=a-F4AmTkYgwC&pg=PA109&dq=River+Deep+-+Mountain+High+phil+spector&as_brr=3&client=firefox-a#v=onepage&q=River%20Deep%20-%20Mountain%20High%20phil%20spector&f=false |title=Phil Spector: out of his head, page 111 |publisher=Omnibus Press, 2003, ISBN	0711998647 |accessdate=2009-10-24 }}</ref>

The track was recorded using Spector's "[[Wall of Sound]]" production technique, and cost a then-unheard of $22,000, and required 21 session musicians and 21 background vocalists. 

The single entered the lower end of the Billboard 100 and stopped at #88 on the pop charts. Even though it had better fortune in the United Kingdom, peaking at #3 in the singles charts on first release,  Spector was so disillusioned that he ceased involvement in the recording industry totally for two years, and only intermittently returned to the studio after that; he effectively became a recluse and began to self-destruct.<ref>Michael Billig, {{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=yQHJC4F6zeUC&pg=PA109&dq=River+Deep+-+Mountain+High+phil+spector&as_brr=3&client=firefox-a#v=onepage&q=River%20Deep%20-%20Mountain%20High%20phil%20spector&f=false |title=Rock 'n' roll Jews, page 110 |publisher=Syracuse University Press, 2001, ISBN	0815607059 |accessdate=2009-10-24 }}</ref> Ike Turner remarked that he felt the record didn't do well in America because the sound was "pop or white", while Tina Turner's voice was [[R&B]], so that "America mixes race in it" - though the writer Michael Billig observed that earlier records which had mixed black singers with a white pop sound had sold well, so it was likely to be that in 1966 the black political movement was encouraging African Americans to take a pride in their own culture, and "River Deep - Mountain High" was out of step with that movement.<ref>Michael Billig, {{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=yQHJC4F6zeUC&pg=PA109&dq=River+Deep+-+Mountain+High+phil+spector&as_brr=3&client=firefox-a#v=onepage&q=River%20Deep%20-%20Mountain%20High%20phil%20spector&f=false |title=Rock 'n' roll Jews, page 109 |publisher=Syracuse University Press, 2001, ISBN	0815607059 |accessdate=2009-10-24 }}</ref> 

''[[Rolling Stone]]'' put it at #33 on its list of [[the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time]].

George Harrison praised the record,<ref name=pc21>[http://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19772/m1/ Show 21 - Forty Miles of Bad Road: Some of the best from rock 'n' roll's dark ages. [Part 2&#93; : UNT Digital Library<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> declaring it "a perfect record from start to finish." {{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} "River Deep - Mountain High" compared a woman's love and loyalty, respectively, to that which that a child feels for a doll, and a puppy has for his master.

==Covers==
===1960s===
In 1967, [[Harry Nilsson]] (who had worked with Spector as a songwriter early in his career) released a [[cover version]] of the song on his first [[RCA Victor]] album, ''[[Pandemonium Shadow Show]]''.

The original Ike and Tina Turner version of the song was re-released the same year to a more receptive public and since then has gained the recognition Spector wanted from the record.
