The '''[[United States]]''' and '''[[Pakistan]]''' have been engaged in several [[Conflict of laws|cross-border]] military confrontations and skirmishes along the [[Afghanistan<U+2013>Pakistan border]]. These incidents have involved the [[Military of the United States|U.S. military]] and [[International Security Assistance Force|NATO-led ISAF]] forces, who have been present in Afghanistan fighting the [[War in Afghanistan (2001<U+2013>present)|War on Terror since 2001]], and the [[Pakistani Armed Forces]]. Most of the exchanges have been indirect [[friendly fire]]s, usually started when American-led security forces have intruded into Pakistani territory or [[airspace]].{{cn|date=December 2011}}

Since the beginning of the [[war on terror]] in 2001 and the subsequent [[War in Afghanistan (2001-present)|U.S. invasion of Afghanistan]] to oust the [[Taliban]] and [[al-Qaeda]] movement, the U.S. has launched several air strikes across into northwest Pakistan to target militants connected with the Afghanistan war who it alleges have fled the country and sought temporary shelter in Pakistan's bordering [[FATA|tribal areas]]. These strikes have been protested by Pakistan, as a violation of [[national sovereignty]], and have resulted in tense diplomatic relations between the two countries. They have also caused an uproar among Pakistan's civilian population and politicians and have [[anti-American sentiment in Pakistan|fueled anti-American sentiments]]. Since June 2004,<ref name="Casualties">{{cite web|url=http://counterterrorism.newamerica.net/drones |title=The Year of the Drone An Analysis of U.S. Drone Strikes in Pakistan, 2004<U+2013>2010 |publisher=Counterterrorism.newamerica.net |accessdate=27 March 2011}}</ref>  the United States military has launched dozens of [[unmanned aerial vehicle]] strikes against presumed [[Taliban]] targets, killing hundreds<ref name="Casualties">{{cite web|url=http://counterterrorism.newamerica.net/drones |title=The Year of the Drone An Analysis of U.S. Drone Strikes in Pakistan, 2004<U+2013>2010 |publisher=Counterterrorism.newamerica.net |accessdate=27 March 2011}}</ref> of militants and civilians.<ref>http://www.presstv.ir/usdetail/212319.html</ref> These drone strikes have been subject to heavy criticism from Pakistan, which maintains that they are not the best way to fight terror and that they will have the inevitable result of uniting the tribesmen along the border with Taliban and against the U.S. Pakistan has previously coordinated with the U.S. on missile strikes but the U.S. has since conducted strikes without informing Pakistani authorities.<ref>[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122157191948543051.html Pakistan Issues Threat Over U.S. Incursions] <U+2013> ''Wall street Journal'', 17 September 2008</ref> Pakistani troops were then ordered to counter act. Several specific actions developed, although no serious diplomatic spats on either side have been reported as of yet. The actions are listed below.

===Standoff of September 15, 2008===
[[Image:CH-47 Chinook in Bagram.jpg|thumb|CH-47 Chinook helicopters have been used to ferry U.S. troops up to and across the border between Afghanistan and South Waziristan]]
Pakistani troops fired warning shots into the air to deter U.S. troops from entering Pakistan. It occurred on the [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] side of the Afghanistan-Pakistan border close to [[Angoor Ada]], some 30 kilometers from [[Wana]], the main town in [[South Waziristan]] in  the [[Federally Administered Tribal Areas]] of Pakistan.

Seven US helicopter gunships and two troop-carrying Chinook helicopters landed on the Afghan side of the border, in the Afghan province of [[Paktika]], where US troops then tried to cross the border into Pakistan. As they did so, Pakistani paramilitary soldiers at a checkpoint began firing warning shots into the air and the US troops decided not to continue forward. The firing reportedly lasted for several hours. Local tribesmen also evacuated their homes and took up defensive positions in the mountains after placing women and children out of harm's way.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7396366.stm Pakistans soldiers 'confronts US' ] -''BBC News'', 15 September 2008</ref>

The standoff occurred less than two weeks after the 3 September 2008 [[Angoor Ada raid]], during which  U.S. Special Forces conducted  a raid inside Pakistani territory. That incident caused much consternation and protests in Pakistan, with claims of Pakistan's sovereignty being violated.

===Lowara Mandi incident===
[[Image:AH-64 Apache.jpg|left|thumb|Two AH-64 Apache helicopters were intercepted over Pakistani territory]]

On 21 September 2008 at 10 pm local time, in the [[Ghulam Khan]] district of [[North Waziristan]] Pakistani soldiers fired on two American helicopter gunships that entered Pakistani airspace with 12.7&nbsp;mm [[heavy machine gun]]s. The helicopters stopped and hovered for a while, before returning over the border to Afghanistan without retaliation. It is unknown if any of the helicopters sustained any damage in this first incident.<ref>[http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jqhY55584EVVKxIIbOeHrLWeoPvA Pakistani troops twice repel US choppers: officials] AFP, 23 September 2008</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7628890.stm Pakistan troops 'repel US raid'] -''BBC News'', 22 September 2008</ref>

Thirty minutes later, two gunships attempted to cross the border again at the same place. Pakistani regular and [[Frontier Corps]] troops fired warning shots into the air and away from the helicopters, causing the helicopters to turn back without attacking any targets in Pakistan.<ref>[http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/Pak-troops-fire-at-US-helicopters-in-N-Waziristan/364409/ Pak troops fire at US helicopters in N Waziristan] <U+2013> ''ExpressIndia.com'', 22 September 2008</ref>

===Tanai incident===
On 25 September 2008 Pakistani troops fired on two American [[OH-58 Kiowa]] reconnaissance helicopters. U.S. ground troops who the helicopters were supporting returned fire. No one was injured on either side and the helicopters were undamaged. American and [[NATO]] officials asserted that the helicopters were flying within Afghan territory to protect an armed patrol. Pakistani officials declared that the helicopters were inside Pakistani territory and were fired upon by "flares" as a warning.<ref>{{cite news |last=Schmitt |first=Eric |title=Pakistani and American Troops Exchange Fire |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2008-09-25 |accessdate=2008-09-25 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/26/world/asia/26military.html?hp}}</ref>

===Kurram incident===
On 30 September 2010. U.S. helicopters entered Pakistani airspace after ground troops determined that a mortar attack by militants in Pakistan was imminent, according to the Coalition. Pakistani [[Frontier Corps]] troops manning the Mandata Kadaho border post fired warning shots, and the helicopters responded by firing two missiles that destroyed the post. Three soldiers were killed and another three wounded. Pakistan responded by closing a key NATO supply route for eleven days.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/30/AR2010093000145.html | work=The Washington Post | first=Karin | last=Brulliard | title=Pakistan blocks NATO's Afghan-bound supply trucks after airstrike kills 3 | date=30 September 2010}}</ref>

===Datta Khel incident===
On May 17, 2011, a skirmish between a U.S. helicopter and Pakistani forces took place in the [[Datta Khel]] area. According to NATO, an American base along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border took direct and indirect fire from Pakistan. Two U.S. helicopters flew into the area. According to the Pakistani military, the helicopters had breached its airspace. Pakistani forces fired at a helicopter twice, and the helicopter returned fire, injuring two soldiers. Pakistan reportedly deployed two attack helicopters, which arrived after the U.S. helicopters had left.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1387949/Pakistan-Nato-helicopter-injures-2-soldiers-attack-Afghan-border.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | date=17 May 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/us-helicopter-pakistani-military-exchange-fire-border/story?id=13621329| work=ABC News}}</ref>

The retired Brigadier Mahmood Shah, former chief of security in the tribal areas, said that so far the U.S. has blamed Pakistan for all that is happening in Afghanistan and Pakistan's point of view has not been shown in the international media, so the matter should be taken up by the [[United Nations Security Council]]. He has advised Pakistani authorities to shoot down NATO aircraft should a similar event take place in the future, and to keep the supply lines closed, on the argument that the U.S. cannot afford a war with Pakistan.<ref name="dailymail">{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2066488/U-S-helicopter-attack-killed-28-Pakistan-troops-act-self-defence.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | date=28 November 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/11/26/us-pakistan-nato-idUSTRE7AP03S20111126 | work=Reuters | title=Pakistan stops NATO supplies after deadly raid | date=26 November 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://oneclick.indiatimes.com/article/0fP57Qp4yI16Z?q=Afghanistan | work=The Times Of India}}</ref><ref>http://www.stuff.co.nz/world/middle-east/6041277/Cross-border-NATO-raid-kills-up-to-14-Pakistani-troops</ref><ref>http://www.lhrtimes.com/2011/11/26/nato-helicopters-attack-on-pakistani-border-post-kills-25-soldiers/</ref>
