{{main|Mongol Empire}}
{{seealso|Timeline of the Mongol Empire}}

'''Mongol invasions''' progressed throughout the 13th century, resulting in the vast [[Mongol Empire]] which covered much of [[Asia]] and [[Eastern Europe]] by 1300.

The Mongol Empire emerged in the course of the 13th century by a series of conquests and invasions throughout [[Central Asia|Central]] and [[Western Asia]], reaching [[Eastern Europe]] by the 1240s. The speed and extent of territorial expansion parallels the [[Huns|Hunnic]]/[[Turkic expansion|Turkic conquests]] of the [[Migration period]] (the 6th century [[Turkic Khaganate]]). 

The territorial gains of the Mongols persisted into the 15th century in Persia  ([[Timurid dynasty]]) and in Russia ([[List of Tatar and Mongol raids against Russian states|Tatar and Mongol raids against Russian states]]), and into the 19th century in India (the [[Mughal Empire]]).


==Central Asia==

{{Main|Mongol invasion of Central Asia}}
[[Genghis Khan]] forged the initial Mongol Empire in [[Central Asia]], starting with the unification of the Mongol and Turkic central Asian confederations such as [[Merkit]]s, Tartars, Mongols, and [[Uyghur people|Uighur]]s. He then continued expansion of the Empire via invasion of the [[Khwarezmid Empire]] in what is modern-day [[Iran]].

Large areas of [[Islam in Central Asia|Islamic Central Asia]] and northeastern Iran were seriously [[depopulation|depopulated]],<ref>[http://www.worldtimelines.org.uk/world/asia/western/AD1250-1500 World Timelines - Western Asia - AD 1250-1500 Later Islamic]</ref> as every city or town that resisted the Mongols was subject to destruction. In [[Termez]], on the [[Oxus]]: ''"all the people, both men and women, were driven out onto the plain, and divided in accordance with their usual custom, then they were all slain"''. Each soldier was required to execute a certain number of persons, with the number varying according to circumstances. For example, after the conquest of [[Konye-Urgench|Urgench]], each Mongol warrior <U+2013> in an army group that might have consisted of two [[tumen]]s (units of 10,000) <U+2013> was required to execute 24 people.<ref>"[https://faculty.washington.edu/modelski/CAWC.htm Central Asian world cities]", University of Washington.</ref>

==Middle East<!--This section is linked from [[Citadel of Arbil]]-->==

The Mongols conquered, either by force or voluntary submission, the areas today known as [[Iran]], [[Iraq]],  [[Syria]], and parts of [[Turkey]], with further Mongol raids reaching southwards as far as [[Gaza]] into the [[Palestine]] region in 1260 and 1300. The major battles were the [[Battle of Baghdad (1258)]], when the Mongols sacked the city which for 500 years had been the center of Islamic power; and the [[Battle of Ain Jalut]] in 1260, when the Muslim Egyptian [[Mamluk]]s, were for the first time able to stop the Mongol advance at Ain Jalut, in the northern part of what today is known as the [[West Bank]].

The Mongols were never able to expand farther than the Middle East due to a combination of political and geographic factors, such as lack of sufficient grazing room for their horses.

==East Asia==

Genghis Khan and his descendants [[Mongol invasion of China|invaded China]], and forced Korea to become a vassal through an [[Mongol invasion of Korea|invasion of Korea]].  They attempted an [[Mongol invasion of Japan|invasion of Japan]] and [[Mongol invasions of Vietnam|Vietnam]]. Their biggest conquest was in conquering China and setting up their own [[Yuan Dynasty]], though it was eventually overthrown by the native Chinese in 1368, who launched their own [[Ming Dynasty]].

==Europe==

{{Main|Mongol invasion of Rus|Mongol invasion of Europe}}
The Mongols invaded and destroyed [[Kievan Rus]], also [[Mongol invasion of Poland|invading Poland]] and [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]], among others. Over the course of three years (1237<U+2013>1240), the Mongols destroyed and annihilated all of the major cities of Eastern Europe with the exceptions of [[Novgorod]] and [[Pskov]].<ref name="parallelsixty.com">[http://www.parallelsixty.com/history-russia.shtml History of Russia, Early Slavs history, Kievan Rus, Mongol invasion]</ref>

[[Giovanni de Plano Carpini]], the Pope's envoy to the Mongol Great Khan, traveled through [[Kiev]] in February 1246 and wrote:

<blockquote>''"They [the Mongols] attacked Rus, where they made great havoc, destroying cities and fortresses and slaughtering men; and they laid siege to Kiev, the capital of Rus; after they had besieged the city for a long time, they took it and put the inhabitants to death. When we were journeying through that land we came across countless skulls and bones of dead men lying about on the ground. Kiev had been a very large and thickly populated town, but now it has been reduced almost to nothing, for there are at the present time scarce two hundred houses there and the inhabitants are kept in complete slavery."''<ref>[https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/citd/RussianHeritage/4.PEAS/4.L/12.III.5.html The Destruction of Kiev]</ref></blockquote>

==Political divisions and vassals==
[[File:Mongol dominions1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Mongol world, ca. 1300. The gray area is the later [[Timur|Timurid empire]].]]
The early Mongol Empire was divided into five main parts<ref>A COMPENDIUM OF CHRONICLES: Rashid al-Din's Illustrated History of the World (The Nasser D. Khalili Collection of Islamic Art, VOL XXVII) ISBN 0-19-727627-X, the reign of Mongke</ref> and various appanage khanates.  The most prominent sections were:
* [[Mongolia]], Southern [[Siberia]] and [[Manchuria]] under [[Karakorum]];
* [[North China]] and [[Tibet]] under [[Yanjing]] Department;
* [[Khorazm]], [[Mawarannahr]] and the [[Hami City|Hami]] Oases under [[Beshbalik]] Department
* [[Persia]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Armenia]], [[Cilicia]] and Turkey (former [[Great Seljuq Empire|Seljuk]] ruled parts) under [[Amu Dar'ya]] Department
* [[Golden Horde]], which was further subdivided into 10 provinces.<ref>A.P.Grigorev and O.B.Frolova-Geographicheskoy opisaniye Zolotoy Ordi v encyclopedia al-Kashkandi-Tyurkologicheskyh sbornik,2001-p. 262-302</ref>

When Genghis Khan was campaigning in Central Asia, his general [[Muqali]] (1170<U+2013>1223) attempted to set up provinces and establish branch departments of state affairs. Genghis's successor Ogedei abolished them, instead dividing the areas of North China into 10 routes (lu, <U+8DEF>) according to the suggestion of [[Yel<U+00FC> Chucai]], a prominent [[Confucian]] statesman of Khitan ethnicity. Ogedei also divided the empire into separate Beshbalik and Yanjing administrations, while the Headquarters in [[Karakorum]] directly dealt with Manchuria, Mongolia and Southern Siberia. Late in Ogedei's reign, an [[Amu Darya]] administration was established. Under Mongke, these administrations were renamed Branch Departments.

[[Kublai Khan]], the founder of the [[Yuan Dynasty]], made significant reforms to the existing institutions. He established the Yuan Dynasty in 1271 and assumed the role of a [[Emperor of China|Chinese emperor]]. The Yuan forces seized South China by defeating the [[Southern Song Dynasty]], and Kublai became the emperor of all China. The territory of the Yuan Dynasty was [[Yuan Dynasty#Administrative divisions|divided]] into the Central Region (<U+8179><U+88CF>) and places under control of various Xing Zhongshusheng (<U+884C><U+4E2D><U+66F8><U+7701>, "branch secretariats") or the Xuanzheng Institute (<U+5BA3><U+653F><U+9662>).

===Vassals and tributary states===
The Mongol Empire at its greatest extent included all of modern-day [[Mongolia]], [[China]], parts of [[Burma]], [[Romania]], Pakistan,  much or all of Russia, Siberia, [[Ukraine]], [[Belarus]], Cilicia, [[Anatolia]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Armenia]], Persia, [[Iraq]], and Central Asia. In the meantime, many countries became [[Vassal state|vassals]] or [[tributary state]]s of the Mongol Empire.

====European vassals====
*A number of Russian states, incl. the [[Republic of Novgorod]], [[Pskov]] and [[Smolensk]],<ref><U+041B>.<U+041D>.<U+0413><U+0443><U+043C><U+0438><U+043B><U+0435><U+0432> - <U+0414><U+0440><U+0435><U+0432><U+043D><U+044F><U+044F> <U+0420><U+0443><U+0441><U+044C> <U+0438> <U+0432><U+0435><U+043B><U+0438><U+043A><U+0430><U+044F> <U+0441><U+0442><U+0435><U+043F><U+044C></ref> Batu khan attempted to invade in 1239, but could not reach the northern part of Russia due to the marshlands surrounding city-states such as Novgorod and Pskov. However, due to the combined effects of Mongol threats, invasion by the [[Teutonic order]], and diplomacy by [[Alexander Nevsky]], Novgorod and later Pskov accepted the terms of vassalage. By 1274, all remaining Russian principalities had become subject to the Horde of [[Mongke-Temur]].

* [[Second Bulgarian Empire]]<ref name="autogenerated2"><U+0420><U+0438><U+043D><U+0447><U+0435><U+043D> <U+0425><U+0430><U+0440><U+0430> <U+0414><U+0430><U+0432><U+0430><U+043D> - <U+0427><U+0438><U+043D><U+0433><U+0438><U+0441> <U+0445><U+0430><U+043D> <U+0433><U+0435><U+043D><U+0438><U+0439></ref> During the end of the Mongol invasion of Europe, the [[Bulgarians]] under [[Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria|Ivan Asen II]] tried to destroy Mongol tumen. But [[Kadan]]'s raids through Bulgaria on his retreat from [[Central Europe]] induced the young [[Kaliman I of Bulgaria]] to pay tribute and accept Mongol suzerainty. A 1254 letter from [[Bela IV]] to the pope indicated that the [[Bulgarians]] were still paying tribute to the Mongols at that time.

* [[Kingdom of Serbia]].<ref name="autogenerated2" /> Around 1288 [[Stefan Uro<U+0161> II Milutin of Serbia|Milutin]] launched an invasion to pacify two Bulgarian nobles in today's north-east Serbia, in the Branicevo region. However, those nobles were vassals of the Bulgarian prince of Vidin [[Michael Shishman of Bulgaria|Shishman]]. Shishman attacked Milutin but was defeated and Milutin in return sacked his capital Vidin. But Shishman was a vassal of [[Nogai Khan]], de facto ruler of the [[Golden Horde]]. Nogai Khan threatened to punish Milutin for his insolence, but changed his mind when the Serbian king sent him gifts and hostages. Among the hostages was his son [[Stefan Uro<U+0161> III De<U+010D>anski of Serbia|Stefan De<U+010D>anski]] who managed to escape back to Serbia after Nogai Khan's death in 1299.

====Southeast Asian and Korean vassals====
* '''[[<U+0110><U+1EA1>i Vi<U+1EC7>t]] (Vietnam)'''.<ref name="autogenerated1">Rene Grousset - ''Empires of Steppes'', <U+0416>.<U+0411><U+043E><U+0440> <U+0415><U+0432><U+0440><U+0430><U+0437><U+0438><U+0439><U+043D> <U+0434><U+0438><U+043F><U+043B><U+043E><U+043C><U+0430><U+0442> <U+0448><U+0430><U+0448><U+0441><U+0442><U+0438><U+0440> II <U+0431><U+043E><U+0442><U+044C></ref> After the Vietnamese captured the Mongol envoys sent to negotiate safe passage in order to attack Southern China, Mongol forces invaded the [[Tr<U+1EA7>n Dynasty]] in 1257. The Mongols routed city defenders and massacred inhabitants of the capital Th<U+0103>ng Long ([[Hanoi]]). King Than Tong agreed to pay tribute to Mongke Khan if he would spare his country. When Kublai Khan demanded full submission of the Tran family, Mongol ''darughachis'' were well received,<ref>''The History of Yuan Dynasty'', J.Bor, p.313, ''Encyclopedia of Mongolia and the Mongol empire'', p.581</ref> though the relationship between the two states deteriorated in 1264. After a series of invasions in 1278-1288, the king of <U+0110><U+1EA1>i Vi<U+1EC7>t (Tr<U+1EA7>n Dynasty) accepted Mongol [[suzerainty]]. By that time, each side had suffered heavy losses due to the large but ineffective wars.

*''' [[Champa]]'''.<ref name="autogenerated1" /> Although King Ve Indrawarman of Champa expressed his desire to accept Yuan rule in 1278, his son and subjects ignored his submission. In 1283, Mongol army was driven from the country and their general was killed, even though they repeatedly defeated all Champa forces in open battle. The king of Champa started sending tribute two years later to avoid further Mongol invasions.

* '''[[Khmer empire]]'''.<ref name="autogenerated1" /> In 1278, a Mongol envoy was executed by the [[Khmer people|Khmer]] king. An envoy was sent again to demand submission while the Yuan army was besieging the fortress in nearby Champa. After this second envoy was imprisoned, 100 Mongol cavalry were sent into Khmer territory. They were ambushed and destroyed by the Khmer. Later, the King of the Khmer Empire asked a pardon and sent tribute in 1285, as he found his country in a position among belligerent neighbors and an enraged Kublai Khan.

*'''[[Sukhothai Kingdom]]''' and '''Chiangmai''' or '''Taiyo'''. When Kublai Khan sent Mongol forces to protect his vassals in Burma, [[Thai people|Thai]] states, including Sukhotai and Taiyo, accepted Mongol supremacy. King [[Ram Khamhaeng the Great|Ramkhamhaeng]] and other Thai and Khmer leaders visited the Yuan court to show their loyalty several times.<ref>''The Empire of the Steppes'' by Rene Grousset, trans. N. Walford, p.291</ref>

* The '''Kingdom of [[Goryeo]]'''. The Mongol invasions of Korea consisted of a series of [[Mongol invasions of Korea|campaigns]] by the Mongol Empire against Korea, then known as Goryeo, from 1231 to 1270. There were six major campaigns at tremendous cost to civilian lives throughout the Korean peninsula, ultimately resulting in Korea becoming a vassal of the Mongol Yuan Dynasty for approximately eighty years.<ref>[http://www.koreanhistoryproject.org/Ket/C06/E0602.htm Expanding the Realm<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The Mongol Empire and the Kingdom of Goryeo tied with marriages as Mongol and Korean royalty intermarried. A Korean princess became the [[Qi Empress]] through her marriage with [[Ukhaantu Khan]], and their son, [[Biligt<U+00FC> Khan]] of Northern Yuan, became a Mongol Khan. [[King Chungnyeol]] of Goryeo married a daughter of Kubilai Khan, and marriages between Mongols and Koreans continued for eighty years. The Goryeo dynasty survived under Mongolian influence until King Gongmin began to push Mongolian garrisons back starting in the 1350s.

====Middle East vassals====
{{Main|Franco-Mongol alliance}}
* The  '''[[Principality of Antioch]] and the [[County of Tripoli]]'''.<ref>Reuven Amitei Press Mamluk Ilkhanid war 1260-1280</ref> - The small crusader state paid annual tributes for many years.The closest thing to actual Frankish cooperation with Mongol military actions was the overlord-subject relationship between the Mongols and the Franks of Antioch and others. Mongols lost their vassal and ally [[Franks]] as the fall of [[Antioch]] in 1268 and [[Tripoli]] in 1289 to the Mamluks.

* The '''[[Empire of Trebizond]]'''- The [[Seljuks]] and the military forces of Trebizond were [[Battle of K<U+00F6>se Da<U+011F>|defeated by the Mongols in 1243]] . After that, [[Kaykhusraw II]], the Sultan of [[Iconium]] was compelled to pay tribute and supply annually horses, hunting dogs, and jewels. The emperor [[Manuel I of Trebizond]], realizing the impossibility of fighting the Mongols, made a speedy peace with them and, on condition of paying an annual tribute, became a Mongol vassal. The empire reached its greatest prosperity and had opportunity to export the produce of its own rich hinterland during the era of [[Ilkhan]]s. But with the decline of Mongol power in 1335, Trebizond suffered increasingly from Turkish attacks, civil wars, and domestic intrigues.<ref>A History of the Byzantine Empire by Al. Vasilief, <U+00A9> 2007</ref>

====Tributary states====
*The '''indigenous people of [[Sakhalin]]'''. The Mongol forces made several attacks on [[Sakhalin]], beginning in 1264 and continuing until 1308.<ref>Mark Hudson-Ruins of Identity, p.226</ref> Economically, the conquest of new peoples provided further wealth for the tribute-based Mongol Dynasty. The [[Nivkh people|Nivkhs]] and the [[Orok people|Oroks]] were subjugated by the Mongols. However, the [[Ainu people]] raided Mongol posts every year.<ref>Brett L. Walker-The Conquest of Ainu Lands, p.133</ref> The native G<U+01D4>w<U+00E9>i people finally accepted Mongol supremacy in 1308, and made tributary visits to Yuan posts for the next a few decades.

*The  '''[[Byzantine empire]]'''.<ref><U+0420><U+0438><U+043D><U+0447><U+0435><U+043D> <U+0425><U+0430><U+0440><U+0430>-<U+0414><U+0430><U+0432><U+0430><U+043D>: <U+0427><U+0438><U+043D><U+0433><U+0438><U+0441> <U+0445><U+0430><U+043D> <U+0433><U+0435><U+043D><U+0438><U+0439>, <U+0416>.<U+0411><U+043E><U+0440>: <U+0415><U+0432><U+0440><U+0430><U+0437><U+0438><U+0439><U+043D> <U+0434><U+0438><U+043F><U+043B><U+043E><U+043C><U+0430><U+0442> <U+0448><U+0430><U+0448><U+0441><U+0442><U+0438><U+0440> II <U+0431><U+043E><U+0442><U+044C></ref>  When an Egyptian diplomat was arrested by emperor [[Michael VIII Palaiologos]], Sultan [[Baibars]] insisted his ally [[Berke]] Khan to attack the Greek Empire. In the winter of 1265 [[Nogai Khan]] led a Mongol raid on Byzantine [[Thrace]] with his vassal Bulgaria. In the spring of 1265 he defeated the armies of Michael and freed the diplomat and former Seljuk sultan [[Kaykaus II]]. Instead of fighting, most of the Byzantines fled. Michael managed to escape with the assistance of Italian merchants. After this Thrace was plundered by Nogai's army, and the Byzantine emperor signed a treaty with Berke of the [[Golden Horde]], giving his daughter [[Euphrosyne]] in marriage to Nogai. Michael also sent much valuable [[fabric]] to the Golden Horde as a tribute thereafter. But the court of [[Byzantium]] had good relationship with both Golden Horde and Ilkhanate as allies.

* '''Small states of [[Malay Peninsula]]'''. Kublai sent surrounding nations his envoys to demand their submission in 1270-1280. Most of states in [[Indo-China]] and Malay accepted the demand. According to Marco Polo, those subjects sent tribute on to the Mongol court, including [[elephants]], [[rhinoceroses]], jewels and a tooth of [[Buddha]]. One notable scholar identified that these acts of submission were more ceremonial in some regard. During the [[Mongol invasion of Java]] in 1293, small states of Malay and [[Sumatra]] submitted and sent envoys or hostages to them. [[Austronesian peoples|Native people]] of modern [[Taiwan]] and [[Philippines]] helped the Mongol armada but they were never conquered.
