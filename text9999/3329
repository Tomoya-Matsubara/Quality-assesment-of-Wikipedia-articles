One of the members of the [[National Salvation Junta]], after the [[25 April]] [[1974]] [[Carnation Revolution]] that overthrew the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|''Estado Novo'']] (New State) regime and established [[democracy]] in [[Portugal]]. He soon became known as one of the most conservative member of the Junta, if not reactionary.

In the 1990s, he drew controversy due to his support for the Indonesian anexation of [[East Timor]].
