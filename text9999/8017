== History ==
K-26 originally began at [[U.S. Route 69 (Kansas)|US-69]] at [[Crestline, Kansas|Crestline]] and ended at [[U.S. Route 66 (Kansas)|US-66]] at [[Riverton, Kansas|Riverton]] in 1941.  By 1954, K-26 was extended east to Galena, then south on its current alignment.  When US-66 was decommissioned, the segment between Crestline and Riverton became U.S 69 Alternate, and the section between Riverton and Galena was marked solely as K-66.<ref name="route56">Kennedy, Richie (2002).
