'''''Call of Duty 2''''' is a [[first-person shooter]] [[video game]] and sequel to the critically acclaimed game ''[[Call of Duty]]''. It was developed by [[Infinity Ward]] and published by [[Activision]]. It was released on [[October 25]], [[2005]] for [[Microsoft Windows|PC]] and [[November 15]], [[2005]] for the [[Xbox 360]]. Other versions were made for [[mobile phone]]s as well as [[Pocket PC]]s and [[Smartphone]]s.

The game is set during [[World War II]] and is experienced through the perspectives of four soldiers, one in the [[Red Army]], one in the [[United States Army]] and two in the [[British Army]].

The game was met with a positive public reception, receiving mostly positive reviews from critics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages2/921995.asp?q=Call%20of%20Duty%202|title=Call of Duty 2 (PC)|accessdate=2007-07-20|publisher=[[Game Rankings]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages2/927725.asp?q=Call%20of%20Duty%202|title=Call of Duty 2 (XBOX 360)|accessdate=2007-07-20|publisher=[[Game Rankings]]}}</ref> The Xbox 360 version sold over 250,000 copies in its first week, and had sold 1.4 million copies by October 2006.<ref name="360launch"/><ref name="USAToday"/>

==Gameplay==
''Call of Duty 2'' is a [[first-person shooter]].<ref>[http://www.aspyr.com/product/story/2 Call of Duty 2 info page on Aspyr], accessed 19 July 2007</ref> The player takes on the role of several [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] protagonists in specific missions during World War II. The player is limited to two different choices of weapons which can be swapped with those left on the battlefield, and also carries both fragmentation and smoke grenades. Unlike the previous games in the series, the player may now only hold two firearms, including a sidearm. Therefore, a player may not carry two larger weapons and a sidearm. The player can use the battlefields tactically by taking a kneeling or prone stance in addition to standing, and using cover for both protection and stealth.<ref name="Q&A">[http://au.gamespot.com/pc/action/callofduty2/news.html?sid=6123417&om_act=convert&om_clk=newsfeatures&tag=newsfeatures;title;2 Gamespot Call of Duty 2 Q&A], accessed 19 July 2007</ref> A compass on the [[heads-up display]] (HUD) shows both friends and foes, and objective markers to indicate locations the player must reach, areas to defend, or enemy cannons or tanks that the player must plant explosives on to disable. The player may also use stationary machine guns and flak cannons to take out enemy forces, in addition to specific missions where the player takes control of a tank to disable the enemies' tank force.<ref>[http://au.gamespot.com/features/6136916/p-17.html Gamespot Weapons Guide], accessed 19 July 2007</ref>

The player has a set of binoculars. While it is generally ignored during infantry-limited gameplay, it is vital to the long-range use of the [[88 mm gun| Flak 88s]], [[Crusader tank| Crusader MK 2 tank]]s and one of the missions in which the player must direct [[artillery]] fire to defend a town. It is also important for scouting, though most of the game takes place in personal, close combat situations reducing the importance of this tactic.

Should the player take damage, the screen will turn red and the sound of the character's heartbeat will become loud; the player must find a way to stay out of fire to recover before entering battle again or else will die and have to restart at the last checkpoint. Some attacks, like grenade explosions or tank blasts, will kill the player instantly if the player is too close to the center of the explosion.<ref name="IGNReviewPCPage2">[http://au.pc.ign.com/articles/661/661230p2.html IGN: Call of Duty 2 PC Review], accessed 19 July 2007</ref>

In April 2006, Infinity Ward released the ''Call of Duty 2'' [[GtkRadiant|Radiant]], which allows a player to create their own multiplayer or single player maps.<ref name=radiant>[http://www.callofduty.com/patch_cod2/ Call of Duty Patch Information] Accessed 10 May 2007</ref> Along with Radiant, the mapmaker includes Maya plug-in support, an effects editor, and an asset manager which allows custom models to be made and imported into the game, as well as custom effects.<ref name=radiant>[http://www.callofduty.com/patch_cod2/ Call of Duty Patch Information] Accessed 10 May 2007</ref>

===Multiplayer===
Each PC multiplayer server can hold a maximum of 64 players, while the limit is eight players on the Xbox 360. There are a total of 13 official maps, and three of these are remakes from the original ''Call of Duty''. There are also 3 expansion map packs named, Bonus Pack, Skirmish Pack, and Invasion Pack. They add an extra 8 maps combined and will bring you anywhere from Russia to France.

The maps vary from [[Normandy]], [[Africa]], and [[Russia]] during the winter. Each team can choose a variety of weapons, depending on the map and which teams are playing. Depending on the map, players can choose between American soldiers, Soviet soldiers, and British soldiers for the Allied forces, while the [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis forces]] must play as German soldiers.<ref name="IGNReviewPCPage3">[http://au.pc.ign.com/articles/661/661230p3.html IGN: Call of Duty 2 PC Review], accessed 19 July 2007</ref>

''Call of Duty 2'' features several game types: Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Search & Destroy, Capture the Flag and Headquarters.<ref>[http://www.planetcallofduty.com/callofduty2/mp/overview.shtml Planet Call of Duty - Multiplayer] Accessed 11 May 2007</ref> Many of these game types are retained from the original ''Call of Duty'' and its expansion, ''United Offensive''.

==Campaign==
<!-- This should not say "Plot" as it is not! -->
[[Image:Callofduty2pointeduhoc.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Pointe du Hoc]] (D-Day) mission in the singleplayer campaign.]]
''Call of Duty 2'' contains four individual campaigns, split into three stories.<ref name="IGNReviewPCPage1">[http://au.pc.ign.com/articles/661/661230p1.html IGN: Call of Duty 2 PC Review], accessed 19 July 2007</ref> Each story concerns a [[World War II]] soldier overcoming insurmountable odds in the war.<ref name="IGN-PC">[http://au.pc.ign.com/objects/620/620769.html IGN: Call of Duty 2 Introduction], accessed 19 July 2007</ref>

===Eastern Front===
{{seealso|Eastern Front (World War II)}}
The player takes the role of Private Vasili Ivanovich Koslov, a [[Red Army]] soldier on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Russian front]];<ref name="Q&A">[http://au.gamespot.com/pc/action/callofduty2/news.html?sid=6123417&om_act=convert&om_clk=newsfeatures&tag=newsfeatures;title;2 Gamespot Call of Duty 2 Q&A], accessed 19 July 2007</ref> The first Russian mission is a training mission during the [[Battle of Moscow]]. Referencing the stretched supply lines of the Soviet forces, the player uses [[potato]]es as practice [[grenade]]s on the grenade range. After finishing 'training' by beating back a German assault, the player is transferred to Stalingrad (a year later), and must recapture a building, walk through trenches as tanks plow over them, and hold a position and recapture another building at the end of the level under hails of gunfire, but ultimately watches his commander order the building to be destroyed. After this, the player takes part in [[house-to-house fighting]] across [[Stalingrad]], ending with the destruction of several German tanks via the use of [[sticky bomb]]s. Soon afterwards, the player is to retake and hold a trainyard, again under heavy suppression, destroys a German tank and recapture several other locations in the same map. Later, the player then has to participate in house-to-house fighting in Stalingrad, destroying yet another tank in the process, and ultimately reach, recapture and hold city hall, performing sniper combat.<ref>[http://au.gamespot.com/features/6136916/p-2.html Gamespot Call of Duty 2 Russian Campaign Walkthrough], accessed 19 July 2007</ref>

===North African campaign===
{{seealso|North African Campaign}}

The player plays a British soldier, Sergeant John Davis of the [[7th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|7th Armoured Division]]. The first map has the player in a sneak attack on German troops, ending with the destruction of a valuable German supply station. The next map on the same night has the player defending a crucial town from overwhelming numbers of Germans, finally achieving victory by destroying much of the German tank force using artillery. This is followed by the [[Second Battle of El Alamein]], during which the player has to fight through several trenches, machine gun nests, flak 88s and finally taking the German's field HQ. The assault on El Daba to intercept the remaining Germans in Africa and destroy several flak 88s soon follows, ending the first British campaign.<ref>[http://au.gamespot.com/features/6136916/p-5.html Gamespot Call of Duty 2 British Campaign Walkthrough], accessed 19 July 2007</ref> An addendum to the second set of missions has the player taking on the role of a British Tank commander, David Welsh. The first mission of the third campaign in [[Toujane]] has the player immediately under fire, holding a household with a single machine gun and then wreaking havoc with an armored car, forced out by mines, and then escaping the town with a bare handful of men. The following mission has the player retaking the town, and the final map involves capturing [[Matmata]] and shooting down several [[Stuka]]s using a [[2 cm FlaK 30|German anti-aircraft gun]].

===Battle of Normandy===
{{seealso|Battle of Normandy}}

As Corporal Bill Taylor of the [[2nd Ranger Battalion (United States)|2nd Ranger Battalion]], the player starts off by playing a part in [[Battle of Normandy|D-Day]], at the assault of [[Pointe du Hoc]], to destroy a German artillery battery, and hold it against a massive German counteroffensive in the following mission. Soon after, the player captures a nearby town and serves as a sniper against mortar crews until reinforcements arrives. The second US campaign is focused on [[Hill 400]], involving the capture of Bergstein, a disastrous charge at Hill 400's bunkers and the defence against the German counterattack, with the player again performing sniper work against German mortar teams, destroying enemy armor, and generally holding the hill against the counteroffensive, all the while burdened by artillery and overwhelming numbers of German soldiers. The final British mission takes place during the Battle of Normandy for control of [[Caen]].

===Crossing the Rhine===
{{seealso|Crossing the Rhine}}

The final mission is set amongst the Americans in the [[Rhine River]] crossing into [[Nazi Germany|Germany]]. It begins as one of the few missions with the player immediately under fire, providing cover fire against the Germans until reaching the river banks and then fighting throughout most of the town. The final fight has the player defeat two German [[Tiger I]]s. In the last scene, Sgt. Randall accepts a field promotion to Lieutenant and suggests to the Colonel that he should promote Corporal Taylor to Sergeant to fill the empty Sergeant spot.

===Ending===

The end credits depict the dramatic rescue of Captain Price from German hands by American soldiers. After the credits end, the words "No cows were harmed in the making of this game" appear, as in the original ''Call of Duty''. This is in reference to the dead cattle visible in the Normandy missions.<ref name="Q&A">[http://au.gamespot.com/pc/action/callofduty2/news.html?sid=6123417&om_act=convert&om_clk=newsfeatures&tag=newsfeatures;title;2 Gamespot Call of Duty 2 Q&A], accessed 19 July 2007</ref>

''Call of Duty 2'' was generally received well by reviewers, with the [[Xbox 360]] version (89 metapoints) scoring slightly higher than its [[personal computer|PC]] counterpart (86 metapoints), according to [[Metacritic]].<ref name=MetacriticXBOX /><ref name=MetacriticPC /> The graphics and sound were widely praised, and the reactions to the regenerating health system were mostly positive, with reviewers such as Gamespot and Gamepro receiving it as an improvement over the previous health bar system.<ref name="GamespotPC"/><ref name="GameproPC">{{cite web |url=http://www.gamepro.com/computer/pc/games/reviews/49412.shtml |title=Review: Call of Duty 2 for PC on GamePro.com. |accessdate=2007-11-16 |format= |work=}}</ref> The PC version multiplayer was criticized as being a step back from that of [[Call of Duty: United Offensive]].<ref name="YahooPC">{{cite web |url=http://videogames.yahoo.com/gamereview?cid=1991674976&tab=reviews&page=2&eid=406401 |title=Call of Duty 2 Review | PC Game Reviews - Yahoo!

[[IGN]] gave the Xbox 360 version 9 out of 10, calling it "outstanding".  Reviewer Douglass C. Perry described the presentation as "classy and well-produced", and said the graphics were some of the best on the Xbox 360 at its launch.  He gave the sound 9.5 out of 10, calling the sound effects "unbelievable", whilst the gameplay was described as containing an "enormous amount of action". Perry also gave the game a score of 9 in the "Lasting Appeal" criterion.<ref name=IGNXBOX />

IGN's review of the PC version was less generous, only giving the game a score of 8.5. Reviewer Tom McNamara was impressed with the presentation and graphics, as Perry had been, describing them as "Excellent" and "smooth" respectively.  He also said the graphics didn't suffer "from also being developed for the 360."  McNamara also praised the sound, describing it as "awesome music, encompassing battle noise, and excellent voice work." The biggest criticism was for the gameplay, where McNamara said "the hard-to-swallow regenerating health makes things a little too easy too often". Finally, the game scored well in Lasting Appeal.<ref name=IGNPC />

[[Gamespot]] reviewer Bob Colayco gave the Xbox 360 version 8.8 out of 10 - including a 10 out of 10 in sound. He summarised his review by stating that ''Call of Duty 2'' had "smooth, detailed graphics and great sound", as well as praising the [[artificial intelligence]], realism, and variety in the campaign.  However, he was critical of the game's pricing, stating it had a "higher pricepoint than its PC counterpart". He also complained that the [[multiplayer]] aspect could only support eight players.<ref name=GamespotXBOX />

Bob Colayco also reviewed the PC version of the game, and gave it a score of 8.8, as he did its Xbox 360 counterpart.  Colayco once again praised the sound, calling the presentation of the game "excellent", as well as praising the aggressiveness of the artificial intelligence. Unlike in his review of the Xbox 360 version, Colayco this time praised the multiplayer, describing it as "fun".  His main critique was for [[CPU|performance]], stating "performance can chug at times".<ref name=GamespotPC />

''Call of Duty 2'' was the most popular launch title on the Xbox 360, with 250,000 units sold in its first week of availability.<ref name="360launch">{{cite web | title=Duty 2 Tops Xbox 360 Launch Sales | url=http://www.next-gen.biz/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1868&Itemid=2 | publisher=Next-gen|accessdate=2007-11-15 }}</ref> 77% of people who purchased an Xbox 360 also purchased the game, which contributed to its high sales.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/677/677174p1.html|title=The Live Chronicles, Ch. 4|publsher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=2007-11-15|author=Douglass C.

==Advertisement controversy==
A television advertisement for ''Call of Duty 2'' was the subject of some controversy in early 2006. The commercial, created by Los Angeles animation studio [[Rhythm and Hues Studios|Rhythm and Hues]], depicted a first-person view of events that were supposed to transpire during the game, rather than scenes from the game itself. Some consumers felt that the advertisements were misleading, and in February 2006 the United Kingdom's [[Advertising Standards Authority]] demanded that networks remove the advertisements after three consumers filed complaints of false advertising. According to ASA spokesperson Donna Mitchell, "Viewers felt that the ad was misleading because the quality of graphics was superior to that of the game's".<ref name="add">{{cite web|url=http://www.mcvuk.com/news/944/TV-ad-lies-face-ban|title=TV ad 'lies' face ban|publisher=MCV|author=Ben Parfitt|date=[[21 April]]|accessdate=2007-11-15}}</ref> Activision denies that the scenes were meant to give an impression of gameplay, stating in a press release shortly after the ASA banning that "The footage was intended purely to communicate the subject matter of the game rather than to represent actual gameplay".<ref name="add" />

==Other versions==
In January 2006, MFORMA (now [[Hands-On Mobile]]) released ''Call of Duty 2'' for [[mobile phones]].<ref name="gamespotmobile">{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/mobile/action/callofduty2/news.html?sid=6141876&mode=all |title=Mforma Releases Call of Duty 2 Mobile Game - Mobile News at GameSpot |accessdate=2007-11-16 |date = 2006-01-05 |format= |work=}}</ref> The [[Pocket PC]] and [[Smartphone]] versions were developed by [[Aspyr Media]] and released January 2007.<ref name="aspyrpocketpc">{{cite web |url=http://www.aspyr.com/product/game_specs/62 |title=Aspyr - Call of Duty 2 Pocket PC Edition |accessdate=2007-11-16 |format= |work=}}</ref> The mobile version is a [[2D computer graphics|2D]] [[top-down shooter]] in vein of ''[[Commando (arcade game)|Commando]]''.
