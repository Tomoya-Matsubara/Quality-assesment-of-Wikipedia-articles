The '''High Line''' is a {{Convert|1|mi|km|adj=on}}<ref name=2open /> [[New York City]] [[linear park]] built on a {{convert|1.45|mi|km|adj=on}}<ref name=faq>{{cite web |title=Frequently Asked Questions |url=http://www.thehighline.org/about/faq |publisher=Friends of the High Line |accessdate=2011-06-08}}</ref> section of the elevated former [[New York Central Railroad]] spur called the [[West Side Line (NYCRR)|West Side Line]], which runs along the [[Lower West Side, Manhattan|lower west side]] of [[Manhattan]]; it has been redesigned and planted as an aerial [[greenway (landscape)|greenway]]. A similar project in [[Paris]], the {{convert|3|mi|abbr=off|adj=on|sp=us}} [[Promenade plant<U+00E9>e]], completed in 1993, was the inspiration for this project. The High Line currently runs from Gansevoort Street, three blocks below West 14th Street, in the [[Meatpacking District, Manhattan|Meatpacking District]], to [[30th Street (Manhattan)|30th Street]], through the neighborhood of [[Chelsea (Manhattan)|Chelsea]] to the [[West Side Yard]], near the [[Jacob K. Javits Convention Center|Javits Convention Center]]. Formerly the [[viaduct]] of the High Line went as far south as [[Spring Street (Manhattan)|Spring Street]] just north of [[Canal Street (Manhattan)|Canal Street]], but the lower section was demolished in 1960.<ref>[http://www.nyc-architecture.com/CHE/CHE029-TheHighLine.htm "The High Line"] on ''NYC Architecture''</ref>

==History of railroad line==
In 1847, the City of New York authorized street-level railroad tracks down Manhattan<U+2019>s West Side. For safety, the railroads hired men <U+2014> the "West Side Cowboys" <U+2014> to ride horses and wave flags in front of the trains.<ref name="High Line History"/> Yet so many accidents occurred between freight trains and other traffic that Tenth Avenue became known as "Death Avenue".<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/25/realestate/the-railroad-tracks-that-turned-a-street-into-death-avenue.html | title=When a Monster Plied the West Side | work=New York Times | date=December 22, 2011 | accessdate=May 12, 2014 | author=Gray, Christopher|quote=The New York World referred to the West Side route as Death Avenue in 1892, long after the Park Avenue problem had been solved, saying 'many had been sacrificed' to 'a monster which has menaced them night and day.'}}</ref>

[[File:Western Electric complex NYC 1936.jpg|left|thumb|225px|Train passing underneath the [[Bell Laboratories Building (Manhattan)|Bell Laboratories Building]], seen from Washington Street in 1936. This section still exists.]]
[[File:HiLine W34 jeh.JPG|thumb|left|225px|Phase 3 section, looking west in 2009. The line climbs along the south side of [[34th Street (Manhattan)|34th Street]], and curves south.]]

After years of public debate about the hazard, in 1929 the city and the state of New York and the [[New York Central Railroad]] agreed on the West Side Improvement Project, which included the High Line. The {{convert|13|mi|km|adj=on}} project eliminated 105 street-level railroad crossings and added {{convert|32|acre|ha}} to [[Riverside Park (Manhattan)|Riverside Park]]. It cost over $150 million, about $2 billion in 2009 dollars.<ref name="High Line History"/>

The High Line, then a portion of the [[West Side Line (NYCRR)|West Side Line]] opened to trains in 1934. It originally ran from [[34th Street (Manhattan)|34th Street]] to [[St. John's Park]] Terminal, at [[Spring Street (Manhattan)|Spring Street]]. It was designed to go through the center of blocks, rather than over the avenue, to avoid the drawbacks of elevated trains. It connected directly to factories and warehouses, allowing trains to roll right inside buildings. Milk, meat, produce, and raw and manufactured goods could be transported and unloaded without disturbing traffic on the streets.<ref name="High Line History"/> This also reduced pilferage for the [[Bell Laboratories Building (Manhattan)|Bell Laboratories Building]], now the [[Westbeth Artists Community]], and the [[Nabisco]] plant, now [[Chelsea Market]], which were served from protected sidings within the structures.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chelseamarket.com/history/ |title=History |work=Chelsea Market |accessdate=2010-07-14 |quote=In 1932, the architect Louis Wirsching Jr. replaced some of the 1890 bakeries on the east side of 10th Avenue with the present unusual structure, which accommodates an elevated freight railroad viaduct. Its great open porch on the second and third floors was taken by the railroad as an easement for the rail tracks that still run through it.}}</ref>

The train also passed underneath the [[Western Electric]] complex at Washington Street. This section has survived until today and is not connected with the rest of the developed park.<ref>{{cite news |title=As High Line Park Rises, a Time Capsule Remains |first=Christopher |last=Gray |authorlink=Christopher Gray |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/18/realestate/18scap.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=May 18, 2008 |accessdate=2011-06-11}}</ref>

The growth of interstate trucking in the 1950s led to a drop in rail traffic throughout the nation. In the 1960s, the southernmost section of the line was demolished. This section started at [[Meatpacking District, Manhattan|Gansevoort Street]] and ran down [[Washington Street (Manhattan)|Washington Street]] as far as [[Spring Street (Manhattan)|Spring Street]] just north of [[Canal Street (Manhattan)|Canal Street]],<ref>[http://chriswhong.com/transportation/west-side-line-selkirk-hurdle/ "West Side Line & Selkurk Hurdle" (map)]</ref> representing almost half of the line. The last train on the remaining part of the line was operated by [[Conrail]] in 1980 with three carloads of frozen turkeys.<ref name="High Line History"/>

In the mid-1980s, a group of property owners with land under the line lobbied for the demolition of the entire structure. Peter Obletz, a Chelsea resident, activist, and railroad enthusiast, challenged the demolition efforts in court and tried to re-establish rail service on the line.<ref name="High Line History"/> During the late 1980s, the north end of the High Line was disconnected from the rest of the national railroad system with the construction of the [[Empire Connection]] to [[Pennsylvania Station (New York City)|Penn Station]], which opened in 1991. In the 1990s, as the line lay unused and in disrepair (despite the fact that the riveted steel elevated structure was structurally sound) it became known to a few [[urban explorers]] and local residents for the tough, drought-tolerant wild grasses, shrubs, and rugged trees such as [[sumac]] that had sprung up in the gravel along the abandoned railway. It was slated for demolition under the administration of then-mayor [[Rudy Giuliani]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/print/2011/04/ny-high-line/goldberger-text |title=Miracle Above Manhattan|author=[[Paul Goldberger|Goldberger, Paul]]|periodical=[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]||date=2012-05-15 |accessdate=2014-05-16}}</ref>

== Repurposing ==
In 1999, the non-profit Friends of the High Line<ref name="High Line History">{{cite web |title= High Line History |url= http://www.thehighline.org/about/high-line-history |publisher= Friends of the High Line |accessdate=2009-08-02}}</ref> was formed by Joshua David and Robert Hammond, residents of the neighborhood the High Line ran through. They advocated for the Line's preservation and reuse as public open space, an elevated park or [[greenway (landscape)|greenway]], similar to the [[Promenade Plant<U+00E9>e]] in [[Paris]]. Broadened community support of public redevelopment for the High Line for pedestrian use grew, and in 2004, the [[New York City]] government committed $50 million to establish the proposed park.  New York Mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]] and City Council Speakers [[Gifford Miller]] and [[Christine C. Quinn]] were important supporters.

On June 13, 2005, the U.S. Federal [[Surface Transportation Board]] issued a ''certificate of interim [[Rail Trail|trail]] use'', allowing the City to remove most of the line from the national railway system. On April 10, 2006, Mayor Bloomberg presided over a ceremony that marked the beginning of construction. The park was designed by the [[James Corner]]'s New York-based [[landscape architecture]] firm Field Operations and architects [[Diller Scofidio + Renfro]], with planting design from [[Piet Oudolf]] of the Netherlands, lighting design from [[L'Observatoire International]],<ref>{{cite news |title=The Business of The High Line |url=http://www.inc.com/magazine/201110/the-business-of-the-high-line.html |magazine=[[Inc.

== Description ==
The park extends from Gansevoort Street north to [[30th Street (Manhattan)|30th Street]] where the elevated tracks turn west around the [[Hudson Yards]] Redevelopment Project<ref>{{cite news |last=Topousis |first=Tom |title=Rail Shot at Prosperity |newspaper=[[New York Post]] |date=December 8, 2006 |url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/rail_shot_at_prosperity_high_line_ynMflHoOkraLadcWnI0NbO|accessdate=2009-08-02 }}</ref> to the [[Jacob K. Javits Convention Center]] on [[34th Street (Manhattan)|34th Street]], though the northern section is expected to be integrated within the Hudson Yards development<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hudsonyardsnewyork.com/office/10-hudson-yards/availabilities/building |title=10 Hudson Yards Building Plan &#124; Hudson Yards |publisher=Hudsonyardsnewyork.com |date=2014-01-22 |accessdate=2014-04-01}}</ref> and the [[Hudson Park and Boulevard]].

The park's attractions include naturalized plantings that are inspired by the self-seeded landscape that grew on the disused tracks<ref>{{cite web |title=Planting Design |url=http://thehighline.org/design/planting|publisher=Friends of the High Line |accessdate=2009-08-02}}</ref> and new, often unexpected views of the city and the [[Hudson River]]. Pebble-dash concrete walkways unify the trail, which swells and constricts, swinging from side to side, and divides into concrete tines that meld the hardscape with the planting embedded in railroad gravel mulch. Stretches of track and ties recall the High Line's former use. Portions of track are adaptively re-used for rolling lounges positioned for river views.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://urbdezine.com/2011/07/05/the-high-line/ |title=The High Line |author=Berens, Carol |publisher=UrbDeZine |date=July 5, 2010 |accessdate=2011-07-08}}</ref> Most of the planting, which includes 210 species, is of rugged meadow plants, including clump-forming grasses, [[liatris]] and [[Asteraceae|coneflower]]s, with scattered stands of sumac and smokebush, but not limited to American natives. At the Gansevoort end, a grove of mixed species of [[birch]] already provides some dappled shade by late afternoon. [[Ip<U+00EA>]] timber for the built-in benches has come from a managed forest certified by the [[Forest Stewardship Council]], to ensure sustainable use and the conservation of biological diversity, water resources and fragile ecosystems.<ref>{{cite web |title=Wood on the High Line |url=http://www.thehighline.org/news/2009/06/27/wood-on-the-high-line |publisher=Friends of the High Line |accessdate=2009-08-02}}</ref>

The High Line has cultural attractions as well as its integrated architecture and plant life. As part of a long-term plan for the park to host temporary installations and performances of various kinds, Creative Time, Friends of the High Line, and the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation commissioned ''The River That Flows Both Ways'' by Spencer Finch as the inaugural art installation. The work is integrated into the window bays of the former Nabisco Factory loading dock, as a series of 700 purple and grey colored glass panes. Each color is exactly calibrated to match the center pixel of 700 digital pictures, one taken every minute, of the Hudson River, therefore presenting an extended portrait of the river that gives the work its name.  Creative Time worked with the artist to realize the site-specific concept, which emerged when he saw the rusted, disused mullions of the old factory, which metal and glass specialists Jaroff Design helped to prepare and reinstall.<ref>{{cite news |title=Seeing the Hudson River Through 700 Windows |first=Carol |last=Vogel |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/22/arts/design/22voge.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=May 21, 2009 |accessdate=2011-07-02}}</ref>  The summer of 2010 featured a sound installation by Stephen Vitiello, composed from bells heard through New York. Lauren Ross, formerly director of the alternative art space White Columns, is serving as the first curator for the High Line.<ref>{{cite news |title=Taking the High Line: the art park that rivals MoMA |first=Judith H. |last=Dobrzynski |url=http://theartnewspaper.com/articles/Taking-the-High-Line-the-art-park-that-rivals-MoMA/20396 |newspaper=[[The Art Newspaper]] |date=May 21, 2009 |accessdate=2011-07-02}}</ref>

Crime has been extraordinarily low in the park. Shortly after the second section opened, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that there have been no reports of major crimes such as [[assault]]s or [[robbery|robberies]] since it opened. Parks Enforcement Patrols had written [[summons]]es for various infractions of park rules, such as walking dogs or bicycles on the walkway, but at a rate lower than [[Central Park]]. Park advocates attributed that to the high visibility of the High Line from the surrounding buildings, a design feature inspired by the writings of urbanist [[Jane Jacobs]].

The success of the High Line in New York City has encouraged the leaders of other cities, such as Mayor [[Rahm Emanuel]] of Chicago, who see it as "a symbol and catalyst" for [[Gentrification|gentrifying neighborhoods]].<ref name="nyt2011-08-03" /> Several cities also have plans to renovate some railroad infrastructure into park land, including [[Philadelphia]] and [[St. Louis]].

It costs substantially less to redevelop an abandoned urban rail line into a linear park than to demolish it.<ref name="nyt2011-08-03" />  James Corner, one of its designers, said, "The High Line is not easily replicable in other cities," observing that building a "cool park" requires a "framework" of neighborhoods around it in order to succeed.<ref name="nyt2011-08-03" /><ref name="nyt2011-08-03">{{cite news |last=Shevory |first=Kristina |title=Cities See the Other Side of the Tracks [''Print edition title'': After the High Line, Old Tracks Get Another Look] |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/03/realestate/commercial/cities-see-another-side-to-old-tracks.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=August 3, 2011 |accessdate=2011-08-03}}</ref>
