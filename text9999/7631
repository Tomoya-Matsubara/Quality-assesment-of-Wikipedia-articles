'''METAR''' is a format for reporting [[weather]] information.  METAR stands for '''METeorological Aerodrome Report''' and is predominantly used by pilots in fullfilment of a part of a pre-flight weather briefing.

It is also used by [[meteorologist]]s, who use the information to help [[forecast]] the [[weather]].  METAR reports usually come from [[airport]]s.  Typically, reports are generated once an hour; however, if conditions change significantly, they may updated in special reports called SPECI's.

The format was introduced [[1 January]] [[1968]] internationally and has been modified several times since. However, the United States and Canada did not adopt the format until [[1 July]] [[1996]].

A typical METAR report contains data for the [[temperature]], [[dew point]], [[wind]], [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], [[cloud]] cover, cloud heights, visibility, and [[barometric pressure]].  A METAR report may also contain information on [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] amounts, [[lightning]], and other information that would be of interest to pilots or meteorologists.

The complement to METAR reports, reporting forecasted weather rather than current weather, are [[Terminal Aerodrome Forecast|TAF]]s.  METARs and TAFs are used in [[VOLMET]] broadcasts.

== International METAR Code ==
[[United States|US]] metars deviate slightly from the [[World Meteorological Organization|WMO]] (who write the code on behalf of [[ICAO]]) FM 15-XII code. Details listed in [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]]'s AIM. The following is a METAR example is from [[Burgas Airport|Sarafovo Airport]] in [[Burgas, Bulgaria]], and was taken on [[February 4]], [[2005]] at 16:00 [[UTC]].

'''METAR LBBG 041600Z 12003MPS 310V290 1400 R04/P1500N R22/P1500U +SN BKN022 OVC050 M04/M07 Q1020 NOSIG 9949//91='''

*'''METAR''' indicates that the following is a standard hourly observation.
*'''LBBG''' indicates the report came from [[Burgas Airport|Sarafovo Airport]] in [[Burgas, Bulgaria]] in continental [[Europe]].
*'''041600Z''' indicates the [[date]] of the [[month]] is the 4th and the [[time]] of [[day]] is 1600 [[Zulu time]], 4:00PM [[Greenwich Mean Time]], or 6:00PM [[Eastern European Time]].
*'''12003MPS''' indicates the [[wind]] [[direction]] is from 120 [[degree (angle)|degree]]s true ([[east]]-[[southeast]]) at a [[speed]] of 3 [[meters per second]].
*'''310V290''' indicates the [[wind]] [[direction]] is varying from 310 degrees true ([[northwest]]) through 120 degrees true ([[east]]-[[southeast]]) to 290 degrees true ([[west]]-[[northwest]]).
*'''1400''' indicates the prevailing visibility is 1400 [[meter]]s.
*'''R04/P1500N''' indicates visibility along [[Runway]] 4 is 1500 meters and not changing significantly.
*'''R22/P1500U''' indicates visibility along Runway 22 is 1500 meters and rising.
*'''+SN''' indicates [[snow]] is falling at a heavy intensity.
*'''BKN022''' indicates a broken [[cloud]] layer at 2,200 [[Foot (unit of length)|feet]] above ground level (agl).
*'''OVC050''' indicates an unbroken [[cloud]] layer (overcast) at 5,000 [[Foot (unit of length)|feet]] above ground level.
*'''M04/M07''' indicates the [[temperature]] is minus 4 [[degree (temperature)|degree]]s [[Celsius]] and the [[dewpoint]] is minus 7 degrees Celsius.
*'''Q1020''' indicates the current [[barometric pressure]] extrapolated to [[sea level]] is 1020 [[millibar]]s.
*'''NOSIG''' is an example of a TREND forecast which is apended to METARs at stations while a forecaster is on watch. NOSIG means that no significant change is expected to the reported conditions within the next 2 hours.
*'''9949//91''' indicates runway status. Format: abcdefgh '''ab'''=runway heading, '''c'''=nature of coating (4=dry snow), '''d'''=surface covered in percent (9= 51-100% of rwy covered), '''ef'''=thickness of coating in millimeters (// stands for either not measurable or not affecting usage of rwy) '''gh'''=breaking index (91=bad breaking index i.e grip on rwy)
*'''=''' indicates the end of the METAR report
