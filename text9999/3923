'''Monotropism''', a typical feature of [[autism]], is when an individual has a restricted range of interests and can only pay [[attention]] to what is in his or her attention tunnel. This hypothesis was published in 2005 and was developed by Dinah Murray, a Doctor of Philosophy; Mike Lesser, a mathematician; and Wendy Lawson, a social worker; and regards [[attention-tunnels]] as the central feature of autism.<ref name=Murray /> Monotropic individuals tend to become too focused on a certain object or activity and find difficulty in shifting their attention, whereas a polytropic individual is capable of spreading his or her attention to multiple things at one time. Monotropic individuals often display [[stereotypies]] which occur because the individual focuses his or her attention on one thing, and repeats it until the attention moves.<ref name=Murray>{{cite journal|last=Murray|first=Dinah|coauthors=Lesser, M. & Lawson, W|title=Attention, monotropism and the diagnostic criteria for autism|journal=Autism|date=1 May 2005|volume=9|issue=2|url=http://www.autismusundcomputer.de/english//139.pdf|doi=10.1177/1362361305051398|accessdate=23 September 2013}}</ref> It is also related to monoprocessing, which is defined as the ability to only process information from one source at a time. This is a way to cope with their [[hypersensitivity]] to [[sensory information]].<ref name="Bogdashina Book">{{cite book|last=Bogdashina|first=Ol'ga|title=Communication Issues in Autism and Asperger Syndrome: Do We Speak the Same Language?|year=2005|publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers|page=79}}</ref>

Wendy Lawson, an adult with [[Asperger Syndrome]], states that some of her difficulties include <U+201C><U+2026>change in routine, expectation, instruction, daily schedule, movement of attention, and even incorporating another channel into the present scenario.<U+201D> They also tend to be more satisfied with commands that are implemented immediately rather than commands involving planning ahead and therefore it is often hard for these individuals to understand language that is referencing future actions. Wendy Lawson also states that monotropic individuals think in <U+201C>closed pictures<U+201D>, meaning they take pictures literally. For example, they may not be able to associate a cartoon animal with the same animal in real life.<ref name=Lawson>{{cite book|last=Lawson|first=Wendy|title=Understanding and working with the spectrum of autism: An insider's view.|year=2001|publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers|pages=33<U+2013>38}}</ref>

== Neurobiology ==
Individuals with monotropism have problems sustaining performance because of attention regulation dysfunction, meaning that something is wrong with their behavioral control system, meaning the parts of the brain that control behavior and attention.<ref name=Van>{{cite journal|last=Van Rijn|first=S|coauthors=De Sonneville, L., Pieterse, J., Swaab, H., Lahuis, B., & Van Engeland, H.|title=Executive function in MCDD and PDD-NOS: A study of inhibitory control, attention regulation and behavioral adaptivity.|journal=Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders|year=2013|volume=43|issue=6|pages=1356<U+2013>1366|doi=10.1007/s10803-012-1688-4|accessdate=October 21, 2013}}</ref> Children with monotropism generally perform poorly at tasks involving executive function, attention, processing speed, and motor coordination. It has been found that children with autism have significantly lower reading scores than normal children and both children with autism and children with [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD) perform poorly in attention tasks as compared to a non-disabled child. Children with autism and ADHD also performed significantly worse in tasks pertaining to reading, attention, [[graphomotor skills]], and processing speed. [[Neuropsychological]] functioning is similar in children with [[high-functioning autism]] and ADHD.<ref name=Mayes>{{cite journal|last=Mayes|first=S|author2=Calhoun, S.|title=Learning, attention, writing, and processing speed in typical children and children with ADHD, autism, anxiety, depression, and oppositional-defiant disorder|journal=Child Neuropsychology: A Journal On Normal and Abnormal Development in Childhood And Adolescence|year=2007|volume=13|issue=6|pages=469<U+2013>493|doi=10.1080/09297040601112773|accessdate=13 November 2013}}</ref>

A defining characteristic of individuals with monotropism is that they have problems involving shifting, keeping, and engaging attention. Multiple studies have suggested that cerebellar abnormalities could correlate with these trends, and that in these individuals the [[cerebellum]] must work harder than normal to achieve tasks. The prefrontal areas have been known to have greater excitation in the brains of these children as well.<ref name=Coleman>{{cite book|last=Coleman|first=Mary|title=The Neurology of Autism|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press, Inc|location=New York, New York|isbn=978-0-19-518222-4|pages=81<U+2013>82}}</ref> 
The amount of attention available is limited, so [[cognitive processes]] are forced to compete. Tasks that require a broad attention span include social interaction, language, and shifting attention, therefore monotropic individuals have problems with all of these. They struggle with [[top down processing]] and do not react well to unanticipated change.<ref name=Milton /> Sometimes the individuals deregulation of thought turns into a [[psychotic disorder]].<ref name=Van />

The [[fusiform gyrus]] is known to be activated by human faces and has been found to be [[hypoactive]] in autistic children, however this is not the only disorder in which this is the case. Eye gaze is also known to activate the [[superior temporal gyrus]], which is less active in monotropic children with autism. These children often cannot imitate or comprehend gestures. However, some have hyperactive [[olfactory pathways]] and are able to identify people by their smell. Dysfunctional neural circuits are characteristic of autism <ref name=Mayes />  Some regions under investigation to be a potential source of autism include the [[frontal lobes]], [[temporal lobes]], [[Insular cortex|insula]], [[limbic system]], [[corpus callosum]], [[thalamus]], [[brainstem]], and cerebellum,<ref name=Coleman /> and therefore these areas could be related to monotropism.

=== Executive Functions ===
Typically, monotropic individuals have problems with cognitive processes that make up [[executive functioning]], including planning, generativitiy, mental flexibility, and self-motivation. It has been shown that executive functioning is directly related to the frontal and prefrontal cortices and that [[dopamine]] influences many executive functions including attention, motor activity, social behavior, and perception of the outside world.
Other disorders that show problems with executive functioning include [[Autism Spectrum Disorders]], [[Attention Deficit Disorder]], [[Bipolar Disorder]], and [[Schizophrenia]].<ref name=Hosenbocus>{{cite journal|last=Hosenbocus|first=S|author2=Chahal, R.|title=A Review of Executive Function Deficits and Pharmacological Management in Children and Adolescents|journal=Journal Of The Canadian Academy Of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry|date=August 2012|volume=21|issue=3|pages=223<U+2013>229|accessdate=October 21, 2013}}</ref>

Specific memory related executive functioning problems that monotropic individuals typically display involve [[retrospective memory]], [[prospective memory]], and executing intentions. In particular, Williams, Boucher, Lind, and Jarroid have performed studies showing that children with [[autism spectrum disorders]] (ASD's) have particular problems with time based prospective memory whereas event based prospective memory seems to be normal. This could be because of problems with self-awareness and mentalizing ability, a characteristic of monotropism.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Williams|first=D|author2=Lind, S. |author3=Boucher, J. |author4=Jarrold, C. |title=Time-based and event-based prospective memory in autism spectrum disorder: The roles of executive function and theory of mind, and time-estimation|journal=Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders|year=2013|volume=43|issue=7|pages=1555<U+2013>1569|doi=10.1007/s10803-012-1703-9|accessdate=October 21, 2013}}</ref> They also are known to have problems with working memory, inhibition, sustained attention, and attentional flexibility.<ref name=Hosenbocus />

=== Theory of Mind ===
Monotropic individuals usually have a deficit in [[Theory of Mind]], which is defined as the ability to understand what other people feel and think. The main emotion associated with Theory of Mind that monotropic individuals lack is empathy. The majority fail at [[false belief tasks]], however some people question whether this failure could be because of poor [[language processing]] or [[memory]].<ref name=Milton>{{cite web|last=Milton|first=Damian|title=So what exactly is autism|url=http://www.aettraininghubs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/1_So-what-exactly-is-autism.pdf|publisher=Autism Education Trust|accessdate=13 November 2013}}</ref>

== Signs and Symptoms ==
Monotropic individuals have trouble processing multiple things at once, particularly when it comes to multitasking while listening. Some have trouble taking notes in class while listening to a teacher,<ref name=Bogdashina>{{cite book|last=Bogdashina|first=Olga|title=Sensory perceptual issues in autism and asperger syndrome: Different sensory experiences-different perceptual worlds|year=2003|publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers|url=http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=RCQ1U38WmjIC&oi=fnd&pg=PA11&dq=monotropism+autism&ots=uXWYIP7uPG&sig=Z4VfRcVkGhJdZf55OmLO-GTKLm4#v=onepage&q=monotropism%20autism&f=false}}</ref> while others are so extreme that they cannot look at a person's face and comprehend what they are saying simultaneously.<ref name=Murray /> A common tendency is for individuals to avoid multiple sensory situations because of this hypersensitivity.<ref name=Bogdashina />  Some common signs of a monotropic individual include:
* Inability to infer and imply things from situations
* Short attention spans
* Difficulty multitasking
* Inappropriate reactions to situations
* Repetitive behaviors such as stereotypies or [[stimming]]
* Obsession with parts of objects
* No peer relationships
* Social problems
* Inability to share emotions, empathy
* Delayed or no speech
* Resistance to change
* Inability to step into someone else<U+2019>s shoes <ref name=Murray />

In order for a child to be diagnosed with an ASD, he or she must exhibit a restricted and repetitive behavior (RRB).  These behaviors arise due to the inability of the monotropic individual to shift attention and cause obsession with an object or ritual. A common symptom of ASD<U+2019>s is a motor impairment, but that is not classified as a criteria for diagnosis.<ref name=Ravizza>{{cite journal|last=Ravizza|first=S.|author2=Solomon, M. |author3=Ivry, R. |author4=Carter, C. |title=Restricted and repetitive behaviors in autism spectrum disorders: The relationship of attention and motor deficits.|journal=Development and Psychopathology|year=2013|volume=25|issue=3|doi=10.1017/S0954579413000163|accessdate=17 November 2013}}</ref> 
Lesser and Murray describe the mind of a monotropic individual to work much like that of a hunter, in which the person fully believes what is currently being seen, and suppresses knowledge learned previously. This mind is capable of suppressing pain and focusing attention on something else. It has the ability to develop great depth in an interest or skill rather than gaining breadth in an array of interests.<ref name=Lesser>{{cite journal|last=Lesser|first=M. M.|author2=Murray, D. D.|title=Mind as a Dynamical System: Implication for Autism|year=1998|pages=217<U+2013>230|accessdate=13 November 2013}}</ref>

== Behavioral Experiments ==
In a study by Crane, Pring, Ryder, and Hermelin, [[savants]] were testing along with typical individuals with ASD's in the [[Wisconsin Card Sorting Test]], which is designed to test design fluency and set-shifting. This test showed that savants have better fluency and monitoring than typical individuals with ASD's, but performed at similar levels on tasks unrelated to the individual's specific ability.<ref name=Crane>{{cite journal|last=Crane|first=L|author2=Pring, L. |author3=Ryder, N. |author4=Hermelin, B. |title=Executive functions in savant artists with autism|journal=Research in Autism Spectrum Disorders|year=2011|volume=5|issue=2|pages=790<U+2013>797|accessdate=October 23, 2013|doi=10.1016/j.rasd.2010.09.007}}</ref>

It has been found that there is decreased cerebellar activity in autistic children in areas regarding shifting peripheral attention, performing attention tasks, and tests quantifying the amount and time children explore new environments. Regarding attention related events, parietal lobe activity and frontal lobe activity have been seen to decrease as well.<ref name=Coleman />

A study in which autistic adults were tested via [[Positron Emission Tomography]] (PET) while performing language tasks showed that activity in the left frontal area and [[dentate nucleus]] was lower in the control group during the listening tasks, but was higher during the motor task of repeating language.  
Sturm, Fermell, and Gilberg conducted a study that tested children with ASD<U+2019>s, mostly Asperger<U+2019>s, that had a normal to high [[Intelligence Quotient]] (IQ). They found that 99% of them had severe social interaction dysfunction, 75% had motor problems, and 94% had restricted interests.<ref name=Sturm>{{cite journal|last=Sturm|first=H.|coauthors=Fernell, E. Gillberg, C.|title=Autism spectrum disorders in children with normal intellectual levels: Associated impairments and subgroups|journal=Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology|year=2004|volume=46|issue=7|pages=444<U+2013>447|accessdate=13 November 2013}}</ref>

Ravizza, Solomon, Ivry, and Carter tested the relationship  between attention and motor impairments via a finger tapping task. They found that attention was not directly related to motor deficits and that there was also not a correlation of motor deficits and restricted interests. However, there was a direct correlation between motor deficits and stereotyped behaviors.<ref name=Ravizza />

== Treatment ==
Treatment for monotropic individuals currently is similar to treatment for autistic individuals. Mary Coleman in the book The Neurology of Autism, states "individualized, in-depth clinical and laboratory assessments and integrative parent-physician-scientist cooperation are the keys to a successful ASD management".<ref name=Coleman /> Some typical management strategies include educational comprehensive programs, [[Applied Behavioral Analysis]] (ABA), speech and language therapy, [[Occupational Therapy]], Sensory Integration Therapy, and [[psychopharmacology]].<ref name=Myers>{{cite journal|last=Myers|first=Scott M.|author2=Johnson, Chirs Plauche|title=Management of Children With Autism Spectrum Disorders|journal=Pediatrics|date=October 2007|volume=120|issue=5|accessdate=16 November 2013}}</ref> 
To assist monotropic individuals in shifting their attention as well as understanding the emotions of others, Lawson, Lesser, and Murray propose that certain steps could be helpful. These include:
* Increasing connections with strangers through the child's interests.
* Improve understanding in lacking areas
* Make tasks more attainable by decreasing the number and complexity of them.
* Make tasks and connections more meaningful.<ref name=Murray /> 
Certain drugs have also proven to be effective to treat specific behaviors characteristic of monotropic individuals. When children with monotropism have quickly changing moods, self injure themselves, and are aggressive, the anti psychotic [[risperidone]] is often prescribed. [[Serotonin]] has been shown to decrease repetitive behaviors and neuroleptic drugs can be prescribed for antidepressant and stimulant needs.
