She is voiced by [[Yayoi Jinguji]] in many of her video game appearances, except in [[Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds]] she was voiced by [[Rie Tanaka]].

Morrigan is a [[succubus]] who is very vain and lives for little more than the excitement of battle. She appears as a beautiful woman with long, light green hair, large breasts and bat-like wings on her back and on the sides of her head. Morrigan can reshape these wings into spikes and blades when attacking her enemies, as well as using them to shield herself from enemy attacks. Her wings can also separate from her, and form into a cloud of bats. She uses a variety of [[Special attack|magical attacks]] as well.

While [[Demitri Maximoff|Demitri]] officially fills the role, it has often been suggested and implied that Morrigan is the main character of the ''Darkstalkers'' series, due to her importance in the overall story as well as her many appearances outside of her game series. She may even be considered a [[protagonist]]ic [[anti-hero]], because despite her demonic appearance and nature, she is not evil.

==Conception and design==
Early in the development of ''Darkstalkers'', the development team decided to have two female characters: a catwoman and a female vampire, characters who would become Felicia and Morrigan respectively.<ref>{{cite book |title=Darkstalkers Graphic File |last=Udon Staff |year=2008 |publisher=Udon Entertainment |isbn=1897376049 |page=56}}</ref> Initially, Felicia was intended to be the "sexy" female character of the title, while the vampire would be the "cute" female character. However, Morrigan's design took on a tone that emphasized sexiness, causing Felicia's character concept to be altered accordingly.<ref>{{cite book |title=Darkstalkers Graphic File |last=Udon Staff |year=2008 |publisher=Udon Entertainment |isbn=1897376049 |page=68}}</ref>

==In video games==
Morrigan is a [[succubus]] and the adopted daughter of [[Belial#Belial in Fiction|Belial]] Aensland. When she was born, Morrigan was extremely powerful (an "S Class" according to some Japanese source books), so much so that Belial sealed away part of her power, one-third in himself to be returned upon his death, and one-third in a pocket dimension, which eventually became a being of its own, a succubus named [[Lilith Aensland|Lilith]]. Unaware of Belial's action, Morrigan grew up and found her life in the Aenslaed castle dull, so she frequently visited the human world to look for entertainment.

On one occasion, Morrigan was drawn to a strange power (which would turn out to be the fire demon [[Pyron]]), and ventured into the human world once again.  Upon her return, she was informed of Belial's death and that she was the next successor to the Aenslaed throne. Although she is now rightfully the ruler of the Makai, she shirks her responsibilities and seeks to continue her life as before. Morrigan eventually meets Lilith, and the two beings merge into one, fully restoring Morrigan's power.

===Gameplay===
Morrigan has moves based primarily on Ryu and Ken from ''[[Street Fighter]]''. Morrigan's ''Darkness Illusion'' was the first ''[[super move]]'' to use the button press sequence (LP, LP, F, LK, HP) that is now commonly associated with the ''[[Shun Goku Satsu]]''. 

One of the many running jokes (and points of criticism) among fans is that she has had exactly the same sprite set as far as ''[[Capcom vs. SNK 2]]'' ([[2001 in video gaming|2001]]) as she did in the original ''Darkstalkers'' (1994). Her sprites looks especially out of place in the ''Capcom vs. SNK'' series as they gain a black outline in the borders. While not technically a sprite, she finally received an updated 3D rendered character model in ''[[Tatsunoko vs. Capcom: Ultimate All-Stars]]''. She will also be updated for her upcoming appearance in ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds]]'', which runs on the MT Framework engine.

===Crossover games===
Morrigan was the original Darkstalker to break out of her original fighting game series and be transplanted in to the ''Marvel vs. Capcom'' series. In the first ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom]]'' game, not only was Morrigan present, but an alternate "Lilith-style" Morrigan was a secret character. In her intro-sprite, Lilith appears and merges with her. This is a nod to when the two merged in Vampire Savior and thus, shows Morrigan's maximum power. In ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom 2]]'', she is joined by fellow Darkstalkers [[Anakaris]], [[Baby Bonnie Hood|B.B. Hood]], and [[Felicia (Darkstalkers)|Felicia]].

Morrigan acts as the sole representative of the ''Darkstalkers'' series in the ''[[SNK vs. Capcom (series)|Capcom vs. SNK]]'' games, making appearances in both ''[[Capcom vs. SNK: Millennium Fight 2000|Capcom vs. SNK]]'' and [[Capcom vs. SNK 2|its sequel]]. Morrigan represented the series along with Felicia and B.B. Hood in ''[[SNK vs. Capcom: The Match of the Millennium]]'' for the [[Neo Geo Pocket Color]]. Morrigan was not present in SNK's ''[[SNK vs. Capcom: SVC Chaos|SVC Chaos]]'' and the ''Darkstalkers'' representative was instead [[Demitri Maximoff]]. Another crossover game Morrigan was absent from was ''[[Capcom Fighting Evolution]]'', in which only Anakaris, Demitri, Felicia, and Jedah appeared. Morrigan would resume being the ''Darkstalkers'' representative for fighting crossovers with ''[[Tatsunoko vs. Capcom: Ultimate All-Stars|Tatsunoko vs. Capcom]]'' and ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds]]''. Morrigan has also represented ''Darkstalkers'' in non-fighting roles, appearing in the Namco collaboration-RPG ''[[Namco x Capcom]]'' and the multi-company crossover tactical role-playing game ''[[Cross Edge]]'', in both cases appearing with other ''Darkstalkers'' personalities. With all of her appearances in Capcom crossover projects, Morrigan is the single most common ''Darkstalkers'' cast member to appear outside of the origin series.

==In other media==
In the [[UDON|UDON Comics]] version of ''Darkstalkers'', Morrigan is a brash 300-year-old succubus who wants nothing more than to visit the human world and have a good time, often at the expense of the men she [[sexual intercourse|seduces]], and completely ignores her duty as future ruler of the Makai Realm; this annoys her father, Belial, and gets her two servants, Lucien and Mudo into heaps of trouble. Eventually she hears of Demitri's restoration, and goes to her father to warn him, only to find that he is in no position to fight. For the first time, she takes on the responsibility that she has often put aside, and returns to the human world to fight Demitri, and prove herself worthy of the Makai Realm and the power that Belial sealed away many years ago. In the special ''Morrigan vs Demitri'' issue which only became widely available in the TBA of the six part comic book series, it is implied that had Belial not sealed away her power, Morrigan might have evolved into a being similar to Pyron and destroyed the Earth.

In the American Darkstalkers cartoon, Morrigan received a drastic change in character and was changed into a villain. Morrigan's character in the cartoon was a typical cartoon female villain (jealous, rude, power-hungry, and despised men). She was also stated to be a direct descendant of [[Morgan le Fay]], and not the daughter of Belial or a resident of the Makai. Her appearance was also drastically altered, making her much older and less revealing.

The Japanese-produced ''Night Warriors: Darkstalker's Revenge'' [[anime]] featured Morrigan more like her game appearances, portraying her as a semi-innocent demon world inhabitant, a member of the royal family who was more interested in going to Earth than in her duties. The picture of idle rich, she would often leave at will out of mere boredom, much to the frustration of her guardians, elder men of the Aensland family. Her father, Belial, is not mentioned. Morrigan's role as a hero was a focus, with her activities as a succubus downplayed; although the [[Original Video Animation|OVA]] depicts [[Donovan Baine]] as the main hero of the story, some say that Morrigan was also a little more [[stoic]] and pretentious than her usually upbeat personality depicted in the games. She is also shown fighting Jon Talbain in the episode intros for the first three episodes. She battles Demitri Maximoff when he attempts to return to Makai but when they are sensed by the Huitzil's, their battle is interrupted. In the last episode, Morrigan goes to Earth after Demitri was bested by Pyron and she encounters him unconscious in the ruins of his castle. Demitri suddenly awakens and attempts to vampirise Morrigan, but she does not resist, much to Demitri's surprise. Morrigan tells Demitri that he may become the leader of Makai after all, since a change of leadership is needed to help its current disarray from falling into destruction. They both later observe Donovan's victory over Pyron.

==Critical reception==
