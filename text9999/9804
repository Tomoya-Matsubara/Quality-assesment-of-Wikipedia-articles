'''Interstate 68''' (I-68) is a {{convert|112.6|mi|km|adj=on}} [[Interstate highway]] in the [[U.S. states]] of [[West Virginia]] and [[Maryland]], connecting {{nowrap|[[Interstate 79]]}} in [[Morgantown, West Virginia|Morgantown]] to {{nowrap|[[Interstate 70]]}} in [[Hancock, Maryland|Hancock]]. {{nowrap|I-68}} is also '''Corridor E''' of the [[Appalachian Development Highway System]]. From 1965 until the freeway's construction was completed in 1991, it was designated as {{nowrap|'''U.S. Route 48'''}} {{nowrap|(US 48)}}. In Maryland, the highway is known as the '''National Freeway''', an homage to the historic [[National Road]], which {{nowrap|I-68}} parallels between [[Keysers Ridge, Maryland|Keysers Ridge]] and [[Hancock, Maryland|Hancock]]. The freeway mainly spans rural areas, and crosses numerous mountain ridges along its route. A road cut constructed for it through [[Sideling Hill]] exposed geological features of the mountain and has become a tourist attraction.

[[U.S. Route 219 in Maryland|U.S. Route 219]] and [[U.S. Route 220 in Maryland|U.S. Route 220]] [[concurrency (road)|overlap]] with {{nowrap|I-68}} in [[Garrett County, Maryland]] and [[Cumberland, Maryland]], respectively, and [[U.S. Route 40 in Maryland|U.S. Route 40]] overlaps with the freeway from Keysers Ridge to the eastern end of the freeway at Hancock.

The construction of {{nowrap|I-68}} began in 1965 and lasted for about 25 years, being completed on August 2, 1991. While the road was being built, it was predicted that the completion of the road would improve the economic situation along the corridor. The two largest cities connected by the highway are Morgantown and Cumberland, both with populations of fewer than 30,000 people. Despite the fact that the freeway serves no large metropolitan areas, {{nowrap|I-68}} provides a major transportation route in western Maryland and northern West Virginia and also provides an alternative to the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]] for westbound traffic from [[Washington, D.C.]] and [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]].

There have been several major planned road projects that would affect the freeway's corridor, including a plan to extend {{nowrap|I-68}} to [[Moundsville, West Virginia]] (which, due to major funding issues, is unlikely to be completed) and the [[Mon<U+2013>Fayette Expressway]], a [[toll road|toll]] highway which was completed in 2011 to connect {{nowrap|I-68}} east of Morgantown.

==History==
===Predecessors===
Prior to the construction of the freeway from Morgantown to Hancock, several different routes carried traffic across the region. West Virginia Route 73 extended from [[Bridgeport, West Virginia|Bridgeport]] to [[Bruceton Mills, West Virginia|Bruceton Mills]], serving regions now served by Interstate 79 (Bridgeport to Morgantown) and Interstate 68 (Morgantown to Bruceton Mills). After the I-68 freeway, then known as US 48, was completed in West Virginia, the WV 73 designation was removed. Portions of the road still exist as County Routes 73, 73/73, and [[County Route 857 (Monongalia County, West Virginia)|857]]. Between I-68's exit 10 at [[Cheat Lake, West Virginia|Cheat Lake]] and exit 15 at [[Coopers Rock State Forest|Coopers Rock]], I-68 was largely built directly over old WV 73's roadbed.

At Bruceton Mills, WV 73 ended at [[West Virginia Route 26|WV 26]], which from there runs northeast into Pennsylvania, becoming [[Pennsylvania Route 281]] at the state line and meeting [[U.S. Route 40|US 40]] north of the border. From there eastbound traffic would follow US 40 into Maryland. This road is now paralleled by I-68 through western Maryland.<ref name=arc_core>{{cite web|publisher=[[Appalachian Regional Commission]]|title=Highway and Traffic Analysis|page=11|url=http://www.arc.gov/images/reports/wsa/wsa-4chap3.pdf|accessdate=2009-04-11}}</ref>

US 40 followed the route of the [[National Road]] through Pennsylvania and Maryland. The National Road was the first federally funded road built in the United States, authorized by [[United States Congress|Congress]] in 1806. Construction lasted from 1811 to 1837, establishing a road that extended from Cumberland to [[Vandalia, Illinois]]. Upon the establishment of the [[United States Numbered Highways|U.S. Highway system]] in 1926, the route of the National Road became part of U.S. Route 40.<ref name=National_Road>{{cite book|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|isbn=0-8018-5155-6|year=1996|page=131|author=Karl Raitz; and George Thomson|url=http://books.google.com/?id=_XSoga0PSd0C&pg=PA131&lpg=PA131&dq=%22National+Road%22+%22highest+point%22|accessdate=2008-10-11|title=The National Road}}</ref>

===Cumberland Thruway===
In the early 1960s, as the Interstate Highway System was being built throughout the [[United States]], east-west travel through western Maryland was difficult, as US 40, the predecessor to {{nowrap|I-68}}, was a two-lane country road with steep grades and hairpin turns.<ref name=mdrd/> In [[Cumberland, Maryland|Cumberland]], the traffic situation was particularly problematic, as the usage of US 40 exceeded the capacity of the city's narrow streets.<ref name=mdrd/> Traffic following {{nowrap|US 40}} through Cumberland entered through the [[Cumberland Narrows]] and followed Henderson Avenue to Baltimore Avenue.<ref name=HLR_Allegany/> After the construction of {{nowrap|I-68}}, this route through Cumberland became {{nowrap|[[U.S. Route 40 Alternate (Keysers Ridge <U+2013> Cumberland, Maryland)|U.S. Route 40 Alternate]]}}.<ref name=HLR_Allegany/>

Construction began on one of the first sections of what would become {{nowrap|I-68}}, the Cumberland Thruway, on June 10, 1965.<ref name=demolition_bridge>{{cite news|work=Cumberland News|date=1965-06-10|title=Demolition in Path of Bridge to Begin}}</ref> This portion of the highway, which consists of a mile-long elevated bridge, was completed and opened to the public on December 5, 1966.<ref>{{cite news|work=Cumberland News|date=1966-12-05|title=Cumberland Thruway Opened to Motorists}}</ref> The elevated highway connected Lee Street in west Cumberland to Maryland Avenue in east Cumberland, providing a quicker path for motorists traveling through the town on {{nowrap|US 40}} and {{nowrap|[[U.S. Route 220 in Maryland|US 220]]}}. The Cumberland Thruway was extended to US&nbsp;220 and then to Vocke Road ({{nowrap|[[Maryland Route 658]]}}) by 1970.<ref name=To_220>{{cite news|work=Cumberland Evening Times|date=1967-02-09|title=Next Phase of Thruway Bids Asked}}</ref><ref name=Vocke>{{cite news|work=Cumberland News|date=1969-10-18|title=New Freeway Sections Will Open Today}}</ref> Problems quickly emerged with the highway, especially near an area called "Moose Curve." At Moose Curve, the road curves sharply at the bottom of [[Haystack Mountain (Maryland)|Haystack Mountain]], and traffic accidents are common.<ref>{{cite news|work=Cumberland Evening Times|date=1972-07-28|title=Transportation Department Head to Check Thruway}}</ref>

===Corridor E===
In 1965, the Appalachian Development Act was passed, authorizing the establishment of the [[Appalachian Development Highway System]], which was meant to provide access to areas throughout the [[Appalachian Mountains]] that were not previously served by the Interstate Highway System. A set of corridors was defined, comprising {{convert|3090|mi|km}} of highways from [[New York]] to [[Mississippi]]. Corridor E in this system was defined to have endpoints at {{nowrap|[[I-79]]}} in [[Morgantown, West Virginia]] and {{nowrap|[[I-70]]}} in [[Hancock, Maryland]]. At the time, there were no freeways along the corridor, though construction on the Cumberland Thruway began that year.<ref name=demolition_bridge/><ref name=md_map_1960>{{cite map|publisher=Maryland State Highway Administration|title=Map of Maryland|year=1960|url=http://www.mdhighwaycentennial.com/images/template/gallery/maps/1960SIDE1.jpg|accessdate=2009-02-04}}</ref> It was this corridor that would eventually become {{nowrap|I-68}}.<ref name=arc>{{cite web|publisher=Appalachian Regional Commission|title=Highway Program|url=http://www.arc.gov/index.do?nodeId=1006|year=2007|accessdate=2009-01-17}}</ref>

The construction of Corridor E, which was also designated as {{nowrap|US 48}}, took over 20 years and hundreds of millions of dollars to complete.<cite name=mdrd/> The cost of completing the freeway in West Virginia has been estimated at [[United States dollar|US $]]113 million (equivalent to ${{inflation|US|113|1976}} million{{Inflation-fn|US}} in current U.S. dollars.)<ref name=wtov>{{cite news|publisher=WTOV|date=2003-09-09|title=I-68 Extension Gets Important Federal Endorsement|url=http://www.wtov9.com/news/2467297/detail.html|accessdate=2009-01-17}}</ref> The cost of building I-68 from Cumberland to the West Virginia state line came to $126 million (${{inflation|US|126|1976}} million{{Inflation-fn|US}} in current U.S. dollars); the portion between Cumberland and [[Sideling Hill]] cost $182 million (${{inflation|US|182|1991}} million{{Inflation-fn|US}} in current U.S. dollars); and the section at Sideling Hill cost $44 million (${{inflation|US|44|1991}} million{{Inflation-fn|US}} in current U.S. dollars).<ref name=mdrd>{{cite journal|publisher=Maryland State Highway Administration|periodical=Maryland Roads|title=Building the National Freeway|date=1991-08-02}}</ref>

[[Image:US 48.svg|thumb|left|100px|Prior to 1991, I-68 was designated as U.S. Route 48.|alt=U.S. Route 48 shield. Consists of the number "48" in black inside a white shield shape on a black background.]]
Much of the work in building the freeway was completed during the 1970s, with US&nbsp;48 being opened from Vocke Road in LaVale to {{nowrap|[[Maryland Route 36]]}} in [[Frostburg, Maryland|Frostburg]] on October 12, 1973, and to {{nowrap|[[Maryland Route 546]]}} on November 1, 1974.<ref name=mdrd/><ref name=frb>{{cite news|work=Cumberland Evening News|date=1973-10-13|title=New Section of Freeway Now Open}}</ref> On November 15, 1975, the West Virginia portion and a {{convert|adj=on|14|mi|km}} portion from the West Virginia state line to [[Keysers Ridge, Maryland|Keysers Ridge]] in Maryland opened, followed by the remainder of the freeway in [[Garrett County, Maryland|Garrett County]] on August 13, 1976.<ref name=mdrd/>

In the 1980s, the focus of construction shifted to the east of Cumberland, where a {{convert|19|mi|km|adj=on}} section of the road still had not been completed. The first corridor for the construction to be approved by the [[Maryland State Highway Administration]] (MDSHA) ran south of {{nowrap|U.S. Route 40}}. This corridor would have bypassed towns in eastern Allegany County such as [[Flintstone, Maryland|Flintstone]], leaving them without access to the freeway, and would have passed directly through [[Green Ridge State Forest]], the largest state forest in Maryland. This proposed corridor provoked strong opposition, largely due to the environmental damage that would be caused by the road construction in Green Ridge State Forest. Environmental groups sued MDSHA in order to halt the planned construction, but the court ruled in favor of the State Highway Administration. In 1984, however, MDSHA reversed its earlier decision and chose an alignment that closely paralleled {{nowrap|US 40}}, passing through Flintstone and to the north of Green Ridge State Forest. Construction on the final section of {{nowrap|I-68}} began May 25, 1987, and was completed on August 2, 1991.<ref name=mdrd/><ref name=nrr>{{cite book|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|author=Karl Raitz and George Thompson|year=1996|isbn=0-8018-5155-6|page=331|title=The National Road}}</ref>

===Designation as I-68===
[[Image:Interstate68 01.jpg|thumb|right|View heading east, {{convert|18|mi|km}} from Cumberland, MD|alt=A four-lane highway descending a hill, with more hills visible in the background.]]
Though the National Freeway was designated as {{nowrap|US 48}}, as the completion of the freeway neared, the possibility of the freeway being designated as an [[Interstate highway]] came up. In the 1980s, the project to improve [[U.S. Route 50 in Maryland|U.S.&nbsp;Route&nbsp;50]] between [[Washington, D.C.]] and [[Annapolis, Maryland|Annapolis]] to [[Interstate highway standards]] had been assigned the designation of {{nowrap|I-68}}. MDSHA, however, later concluded that adding additional route shields to the US&nbsp;50 freeway would not be helpful to drivers, since about half the freeway already had two route designations (US 50 and [[U.S. Route 301|US 301]]) and drivers on the freeway were already familiar with the US&nbsp;50 designation.<ref name=tunv>{{cite news|work=Washington Times|author=Ron Shaffer|date=1990-01-12|title=Tunnel Visions}}</ref> This made the designation to be applied to that freeway more flexible, and so in 1989, the [[American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials]] (AASHTO), the organization composed of the various state departments of transportation that decides route numbering in the United States, approved MDSHA's request to renumber the {{nowrap|US 50}} freeway from {{nowrap|I-68}} to [[Interstate 595 (Maryland)|Interstate 595]].<ref name=aashto19891>{{cite web|author=[[American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials]]|title=Report to the Special Committee on Route Numbering|date=1989-06-07|url=http://cms.transportation.org/sites/route/docs/1989-USRN_Cmte.PDF|<!--page=4|-->accessdate=2009-01-17}}</ref> That same year, AASHTO approved changing {{nowrap|US 48's}} designation to {{nowrap|I-68}}.<ref name=aashto19891 /><!--<ref name=aashto19892>{{cite web|author=American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials|title=Report to the Special Committee on Route Numbering|date=1989-06-07|url=http://cms.transportation.org/sites/route/docs/1989-USRN_Cmte.PDF|page=6|accessdate=2009-01-17}}</ref>--> This change took effect upon the completion of the last section of the National Freeway, on August 2, 1991.<ref name=mdrd/>

With the completion of I-68 and the change in its route number, the {{nowrap|US 48}} designation was removed. In 2002, AASHTO approved the establishment of a [[U.S. Route 48|new {{nowrap|US 48}}]], this time for the [[Corridor H]] highway from [[Weston, West Virginia]] to [[Strasburg, Virginia]].<ref name=aashto2002>{{cite web|author=American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials|title=Report to the Special Committee on Route Numbering|date=2002-11-05|url=http://cms.transportation.org/sites/route/docs/2002_USRN_Cmte.PDF|page=8|accessdate=2009-02-04}}</ref> This marks the third time that the US 48 number has been assigned to a highway, the first use being for [[U.S. Route 48 (1926)|a highway in California]] that existed in the 1920s.<ref name=1926_ush>{{cite map|publisher=[[Oklahoma Department of Transportation]]|url=http://www.okladot.state.ok.us/hqdiv/p-r-div/maps/misc-maps/1926us.pdf|title=1926 United States Numbered Highways|year=1926|accessdate=2007-06-23}}</ref>

===Incidents===
Numerous accidents and incidents have occurred on {{nowrap|I-68}}. On June 1, 1991, a gasoline tanker descending into downtown Cumberland from the east attempted to exit the freeway at exit 43D, Maryland Avenue. The tanker went out of control and overturned as the driver tried to go around the sharp turn at the exit. Gasoline began to leak from the damaged tanker, forcing the evacuation of a three-block area of Cumberland. Approximately 30 minutes later, the tanker exploded, setting eight houses on fire. The fire caused an estimated $250,000 in damages (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|250|1991}},000{{Inflation-fn|US}} in current U.S. dollars), and prompted MDSHA to place signs prohibiting hazardous materials trucks from exiting at the Maryland Avenue exit.<ref name=stl>{{cite news|publisher=Associated Press|title=Driver Of Overturned Tanker Warns Residents Before Blasts|date=1991-06-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Ruben Castaneda|work=Washington Post|date=1991-06-02|title=Gasoline Truck Overturns; Leak Ignites 8 Md.

On May 23, 2003, poor visibility due to fog was a major contributing factor to an 85-vehicle [[pileup]] on {{nowrap|I-68}} on [[Savage Mountain]] west of [[Frostburg, Maryland|Frostburg]]. Two people were killed and nearly 100 people were injured in the pileup. Because of the extent of the wreckage on the road, {{nowrap|I-68}} remained blocked for 24 hours while the wreckage was cleared.<ref name=cnnfog>{{cite news|publisher=CNN|url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/US/South/05/23/maryland.accidents/index.html?iref=newssearch|date=2003-05-23|title=85-vehicle pileup kills two in western Maryland|accessdate=2009-01-17}}</ref> In the aftermath of the pileup, the question of how to deal with fog in the future was discussed. Though the cost of a fog warning system can be considerable, MDSHA installed such a system in 2005 at a cost of $230,000 (${{Inflation|US|230|2005}},000{{Inflation-fn|US}} in current U.S. dollars).<ref name=nytfog>{{cite news|work=New York Times|author=Matthew Wald|date=2003-06-18|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/18/us/war-on-road-fog-lacks-easy-solution.html|title=War on Road Fog Lacks Easy Solution|accessdate=2009-10-23}}</ref><ref name=hagersfog/> The system alerts drivers when visibility drops below {{convert|1000|ft|m}}.<ref name=hagersfog>{{cite news|work=Hagerstown Herald Mail|date=2005-07-03|url=http://www.herald-mail.com/?module=displaystory&story_id=115966&format=html|title=Fog warning system installed on I-68|accessdate=2009-01-17}}</ref>

[[File:Sidling-Hill-MD.jpg|thumb|right|The Sideling Hill road cut, photographed from Interstate 70 east of the mountain|alt=A small town is seen below a mountain ridge which contains a deep V-shaped cut.]]
One of the arguments in favor of the construction of {{nowrap|I-68}} was that the freeway would improve the poor economic conditions in western Maryland. The economy of the surrounding area has improved since the construction of the freeway, especially in [[Garrett County, Maryland|Garrett County]], where the freeway opened up the county to tourism from [[Washington, D.C.]] and [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]]. Correspondingly, Garrett County saw a sharp increase in population and employment during and after the construction of the road, with full- and part-time employment increasing from 8,868 in 1976 to 15,334 in 1991.<ref name=edh>{{cite web|title=Economic Development History of {{nowrap|I-68}} in Maryland|publisher=Federal Highway Administration|author=Jason Bezis and Kristin Noyes|date=2008-11-05|url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/Planning/econdev/i68md.htm|accessdate=2009-01-17}}</ref> However, economic difficulties remain in Allegany and Garrett counties.<ref name=washpostecon>{{cite news|work=Washington Post|author=Dan Beyers|date=1992-09-08|title=Mountain Road of Promise Slow to Lift Fortunes}}</ref> There were concerns over loss of customers to businesses that have been cut off from the main highway due to the construction of the new alignment in the 1980s, leading to protests when then-Governor [[Harry Hughes]] visited the Sideling Hill road cut when it was opened.<ref name=hh>{{cite book|publisher=The History Press|year=2006|title=My Unexpected Journey|author=Harry Roe Hughes|isbn=1-59629-117-6|page=105}}</ref>

===Future work===
The [[Mon-Fayette Expressway]], a proposed {{convert|adj=on|66|mi|km}} [[toll road]] from [[Interstate 376]] in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]] to {{nowrap|I-68}}, has been partially completed in Pennsylvania. The remaining portion of the highway to {{nowrap|I-68}} through West Virginia is currently under construction, and when completed, is expected to be designated as [[West Virginia Route 43]], to match the Pennsylvania state highway designation of the road, [[Pennsylvania Route 43]]. This section of the highway, which will utilize existing Exit 10 on Interstate 68, opened on June 21, 2011 between I-68 and Bowers Lane.<ref name=turnpike>{{cite news|publisher=The Dominion Post|date=2009-07-06|title=Work to Begin on Interchange for I-68, W.Va. 43}}</ref><ref name="Partially Open">{{cite news |title=First Exit of Mon-Fayette Expressway Opens |date=June 22, 2011 |work=[[The State Journal]] |location=Charleston, WV |accessdate=June 25, 2011 |url=http://www.statejournal.com/story.cfm?func=viewstory&storyid=101911}}</ref> The remainder of the Mon-Fayette Expressway in West Virginia is to open on July 11, 2011.<ref name="Open July 11">{{cite news |title=Mon-Fayette Expressway to Open July 11 |date=June 24, 2011 |work=The State Journal |location=Charleston, WV |accessdate=June 25, 2011 |url=http://www.statejournal.com/story.cfm?func=viewstory&storyid=102088}}</ref>

In the 1990s, the possibility of a westward extension of {{nowrap|I-68}} in West Virginia was discussed. Such an extension would connect the western terminus of {{nowrap|I-68}} in Morgantown to [[West Virginia Route 2]] in [[Moundsville, West Virginia|Moundsville]]. A 1989 proposal had suggested a toll road be built along this corridor.<ref name=cgzmnd>{{cite news|work=Charleston Gazette|author=Rick Steelhammer|date=2000-11-28|title=West Virginia Hearings on {{nowrap|I-68}} Extension Set for Next Week.}}</ref> In 2003, the [[Federal Highway Administration]] approved the extension, paving the way for federal funding and for the road to become part of the [[National Highway System (United States)|National Highway System]] on completion.<ref name=wvdotmnd>{{cite web|publisher=West Virginia Department of Transportation|author=Carol Melling|date=2003-10-31|title=I-68 Extension Now Eligible for Federal Funding|url=http://www.wvdot.com/13_news/13_news_dtl.cfm?s=456|accessdate=2009-01-17}}</ref> However, the project ran into problems due to lack of funds, and in 2008, West Virginia Governor [[Joe Manchin]] suggested dropping the project altogether, making construction of a westward extension of I-68 unlikely in the near future.<ref name=wnrmnd>{{cite news|work=Wheeling News-Register|author=Art Limann|date=2008-08-12|title=Authority Won<U+2019>t Give Up on I-68 to Marshall|url=http://www.news-register.net/page/content.detail/id/512794.html|accessdate=2009-01-17}}</ref>

Near this interchange, {{nowrap|I-68}} passes over Cheat Lake and climbs a steep ascent out of [[Cheat Canyon]].<ref name=gm_wv>{{google maps |url=http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&hl=en&geocode=17527361211364741479,39.577614,-79.974921%3B7412300870819612668,39.663520,-79.476700&saddr=39.578769,-79.972959&daddr=I-68+E+%4039.663520,+-79.476700&mra=dme&mrcr=0&mrsp=0&sz=15&doflg=ptm&sll=39.575924,-79.973001&sspn=0.015018,0.037594&ie=UTF8&ll=39.626846,-79.698944&spn=0.480208,1.203003&z=10 |title=I-68 in West Virginia |accessdate=2008-08-01}}</ref>

Entering Preston County, the route interchanges with County Route 73/12, which provides access to [[Coopers Rock State Forest]]. In contrast to the Morgantown area, the portion of Preston County that {{nowrap|I-68}} crosses is more rural, with the only town along the route being [[Bruceton Mills, West Virginia|Bruceton Mills]]. In Bruceton Mills, {{nowrap|I-68}} meets [[West Virginia Route 26]]. {{nowrap|I-68}} meets County Route 5 (Hazleton Road) at its last exit before entering Garrett County, Maryland.<ref name=gm_wv/>

The region of West Virginia through which the freeway passes is rural and mountainous. There are several sections that have steep grades, especially near the Cheat River Canyon, where there is a [[truck escape ramp]] in case trucks lose their brakes descending the steep grade.<ref name=wvdotmncm/>

The peak traffic density on Interstate 68 in West Virginia is 32,900 [[average annual daily traffic]] at the interchange with I-79 in Morgantown. The traffic gradually decreases further eastward, reaching a low point at 14,600 cars per day at the Hazleton exit.<ref name=wvdot_traffic>{{cite web|publisher=[[West Virginia Department of Transportation]]|year=2007|url=http://www.wvdot.com/3_ROADWAYS/rp/TA%20Traffic%20files/IntsCounts/07%20Counts/I-68%20Morgantown%20to%20Maryland.pdf|accessdate=2009-04-11|title=Interstate System Average Daily Traffic: I-68 Morgantown to Maryland}}</ref>

===Maryland===
[[File:Maryland State Line Interstate 68.jpg|thumb|right|Entering Maryland from West Virginia on I-68 East towards Cumberland|alt=A sign adjacent to a four-lane highway reads "Maryland welcomes you. Enjoy your visit! Martin O'Malley, Governor"]]
After entering Garrett County, {{nowrap|I-68}} continues its run through rural areas, crossing the northern part of the county. The terrain through this area consists of ridges that extend from southwest to northeast, with {{nowrap|I-68}} crossing the ridges through its east/west run. The first exit in Maryland is at {{nowrap|[[Maryland Route 42]]}} in [[Friendsville, Maryland|Friendsville]]. {{nowrap|I-68}} ascends [[Keysers Ridge, Maryland|Keysers Ridge]], where it meets {{nowrap|[[U.S. Route 40 in Maryland|US 40]]}} and {{nowrap|[[U.S. Route 219 in Maryland|US 219]]}}, both of which join the highway at Keysers Ridge.<ref name=HLR_Garrett/> The roadway that used to be the surface alignment of {{nowrap|US 40}} parallels {{nowrap|I-68}} to Cumberland, and is now designated as [[U.S. Route 40 Alternate (Keysers Ridge&nbsp;<U+2013> Cumberland, Maryland)|US 40 ALT]]. {{nowrap|I-68}} crosses [[Negro Mountain]], which was the highest point along the historic [[National Road]] that the freeway parallels east of Keysers Ridge. This is the source of the name of the freeway in Maryland: the National Freeway.<ref name=mdrd/> Three miles (five kilometers) east of [[Grantsville, Maryland|Grantsville]], US&nbsp;219 leaves the National Freeway to run northward towards [[Meyersdale, Pennsylvania]], while I-68 continues eastward, crossing [[Savage Mountain]] before entering Allegany County.<ref name=HLR_Garrett/>

The section of I-68 west of [[Dans Mountain]] in Allegany County is located in the [[Allegheny Mountains]], characterized in Garrett County by a series of uphill and downhill stretches along the freeway, each corresponding to a ridge that the freeway crosses. In Allegany County, the freeway crosses the [[Allegheny Front]], where, from Savage Mountain to LaVale, the highway drops in elevation by {{convert|1800|ft|m}} in a distance of {{convert|9|mi|km}}.<ref name=nrr73>{{cite book|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|author=Karl Raitz and George Thompson|year=1996|isbn=0-8018-5155-6|page=73|title=The National Road}}</ref><ref name=gmaps>{{google maps |url=http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&source=s_d&saddr=I-68+E&daddr=39.634646,-78.833084&hl=en&geocode=FUhiXQIddB1L-w%3B&mra=dme&mrcr=0&mrsp=1&sz=13&sll=39.644428,-78.838749&sspn=0.089355,0.154324&ie=UTF8&ll=39.639802,-78.884926&spn=0.178723,0.308647&t=p&z=12 |title=Topographic map of Interstate 68 in western Allegany County |accessdate=2009-02-15}}</ref>

The traffic density on {{nowrap|I-68}} in Garrett County is rather sparse compared to that of Allegany County. At the Maryland&nbsp;<U+2013> West Virginia state line, there is an [[annual average daily traffic]] of 11,581. This density increases to its highest point in Garrett County at exit 22, where US&nbsp;219 leaves {{nowrap|I-68}}; 19,551 vehicles per day drive through this section. At the Allegany County line, the traffic density decreases slightly to 18,408.<ref name=HLR_Garrett/> In Allegany County, the vehicle count increases to 28,861 in [[LaVale, Maryland|LaVale]], and to the freeway's peak of 46,191 at the first {{nowrap|US 220}} interchange (exit 42) in Cumberland. East of Cumberland, the vehicle count decreases to 16,551 at Martins Mountain and stays nearly constant to the eastern terminus of {{nowrap|I-68}} in [[Hancock, Maryland|Hancock]].<ref name=HLR_Allegany/>

After entering Allegany County, {{nowrap|I-68}} bypasses [[Frostburg, Maryland|Frostburg]] to the south, with two exits, one to Midlothian Road (unsigned [[Maryland Route 736]]) and one to [[Maryland Route 36|MD 36]]. Near the MD 36 exit is [[God's Ark of Safety]] church, which is known for its attempt to build a replica of [[Noah's Ark]]. This replica, which currently consists of a steel frame, can be seen from {{nowrap|I-68}}.<ref name=ppgark>{{cite news |author=Caitlin Cleary | url=http://post-gazette.com/pg/06106/682602-85.stm | title=If the flood comes too soon, this ark won't be quite ready | work=Local News | work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] | date=2006-04-16 | accessdate=2006-04-16}}</ref>

East of Frostburg, {{nowrap|I-68}} crosses a bridge above Spruce Hollow near [[Clarysville, Maryland|Clarysville]], passing over [[Maryland Route 55]], which runs along the bottom of the valley. The freeway runs along the hillside above {{nowrap|US 40 ALT}} in the valley formed by Braddock Run. Entering [[LaVale, Maryland|LaVale]], {{nowrap|I-68}} has exits to {{nowrap|US 40 ALT}} and [[MD 658]] (signed southbound as U.S.&nbsp;Route&nbsp;220 Truck). I-68 ascends [[Haystack Mountain (Maryland)|Haystack Mountain]], entering the city of [[Cumberland, Maryland|Cumberland]]. This is the most congested section of the highway in Maryland. The speed limit on the highway drops from {{convert|65|mph|km/h}} in LaVale to {{convert|55|mph|km/h}} until the [[U.S. Route 220 in Maryland|US&nbsp;220]] exit, and to {{convert|40|mph|km/h}} in downtown Cumberland.<ref name=HLR_Allegany/> This drop in the speed limit is due to several factors, including heavy congestion, closely spaced interchanges, and a sharp curve in the road, known locally as "Moose Curve," located at the bottom of Haystack Mountain. This section of the highway was originally built in the 1960s as the Cumberland Thruway, a bypass to the original path of {{nowrap|U.S. Route 40}} through Cumberland.<ref name=mdrd/>

Until 2008, signs at exit 43A in downtown Cumberland labeled the exit as providing access to [[West Virginia Route 28 Alternate]] {{nowrap|(WV 28 ALT)}}. Because of this, many truckers used this exit to get to [[West Virginia Route 28]] {{nowrap|(WV 28)}}. This created problems on {{nowrap|WV 28 ALT}} in [[Ridgeley, West Virginia]], as trucks became stuck under a low railroad overpass, blocking traffic through Ridgeley. To reduce this problem, the [[Maryland State Highway Administration]] removed references to {{nowrap|WV 28 ALT}} from guide signs for exit 43A and placed warning signs in Cumberland and on I-68 approaching Cumberland advising truckers to instead use exit 43B to {{nowrap|[[Maryland Route 51]]}}, which allows them to connect to {{nowrap|WV 28}} via Virginia Avenue, bypassing the low overpass in Ridgeley.<ref name=wv28a>{{cite news|work=Cumberland Times-News|author=Sarah Moses|date=2008-12-23|title=Signs alert truck drivers to low overpass in Ridgeley|url=http://www.times-news.com/local/local_story_358085114.html|accessdate=2009-01-17|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5duRzfkrf|archivedate=2009-01-17}}</ref>

[[File:Sideling Hill road cut for Interstate 68 in Maryland.jpg|thumb|right|I-68 passing through the Sideling Hill road cut|alt=A highway passes through a cut through a mountain. The rock walls of the cut are visible above the highway.]]
At exit 44 in east Cumberland, {{nowrap|US 40 ALT}} meets the freeway and ends, and at exit 46, US&nbsp;220 leaves {{nowrap|I-68}} and runs northward toward [[Bedford, Pennsylvania]]. {{nowrap|I-68}} continues across northeastern Allegany County, passing [[Rocky Gap State Park]] near exit 50. In northeastern Allegany County, the former {{nowrap|US 40}} bypassed by I-68 is designated as {{nowrap|[[Maryland Route 144]]}} {{nowrap|(MD 144)}}, with several exits from I-68 along the route. I-68 crosses several mountain ridges along this section of the highway, including Martins Mountain, Town Hill, and Green Ridge, and the highway passes through [[Green Ridge State Forest]]. East of Green Ridge State Forest, MD&nbsp;144 ends at {{nowrap|[[U.S. Route 40 Scenic]]}} (US 40 Scenic), another former section of {{nowrap|US 40}}.<ref name=HLR_Allegany/>

{{nowrap|I-68}} crosses into [[Washington County, Maryland|Washington County]] at [[Sideling Hill Creek (Potomac River)|Sideling Hill Creek]] and ascends [[Sideling Hill]]. The road cut that was built into Sideling Hill for I-68 can be seen for several miles in each direction, and has become a tourist attraction as a result of the geologic structure exposed by the road cut.<ref name=mdgs>{{cite web|url=http://www.mgs.md.gov/esic/brochures/sideling.html|publisher=Maryland Geological Society|year=1994|author=David Brezinski|title=Geology of the Sideling Hill Road Cut|accessdate=2009-01-17}}</ref>

On the east side of Sideling Hill, {{nowrap|I-68}} again interchanges with {{nowrap|US 40}} Scenic, at its eastern terminus at Woodmont Road. Here {{nowrap|US 40 Scenic}} ends at a section of MD&nbsp;144 separate from the section further west. Four miles (six kilometers) east of this interchange, {{nowrap|I-68}} ends at [[Interstate 70 in Maryland|I-70]] and [[U.S. Route 522|U.S.&nbsp;Route&nbsp;522]] in the town of [[Hancock, Maryland|Hancock]].<ref name=HLR_Washington/>
