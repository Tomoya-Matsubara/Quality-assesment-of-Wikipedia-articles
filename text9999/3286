The date of his birth is unknown. He died on February 17, 1371. The long reign of Ivan Alexander is considered a transitional period in Bulgarian medieval history. Ivan Alexander began his rule by dealing with internal problems and external threats from Bulgaria's neighbours, the [[Byzantine Empire]] and [[Serbian Empire|Serbia]], as well as leading his empire into a period of economic recovery and cultural and religious renaissance.<ref name="balgarite-2-1">''B<U+01CE>lgarite i B<U+01CE>lgarija'', 2.1</ref>

However, the emperor was later unable to cope with the mounting incursions of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] forces, [[Kingdom of Hungary in the Middle Ages#Golden Era .281308-1490.29|Hungarian]] invasions from the northwest and the [[Black Death]].<ref name="lalkov-pp42-43" /> In an ill-fated attempt to combat these problems, he divided the country between his two sons,<ref name="delev">Delev, ''Istorija i civilizacija za 11. klas''</ref><ref name=castellan>{{cite book|title=Histoire des Balkans, XIVe-XXe si<U+00E8>cle|last=Castellan|first=Georges|year=1999|publisher=[[Fayard]]|location=[[Paris]]|isbn=2213605262|language=French|page=42}}</ref> thus forcing it to face the imminent Ottoman conquest weakened and divided.<ref name="lalkov-pp42-43" /><ref name=castellan/>

== Early rule ==
Ivan Alexander was the son of the ''[[despotes|despot<U+0113>s]]'' Sracimir of [[Kran, Bulgaria|Kr<U+01CE>n]] by [[Keratsa Petritsa|Petrica]], a sister of [[Michael Shishman of Bulgaria|Michael Asen III of Bulgaria]].<ref name=bozilov>Bo<U+017E>ilov, ''Familijata na Asenevci'', pp. 192<U+2013>235.</ref> Therefore, Ivan Alexander was a nephew of Michael Asen III.<ref name="balgarite-2-1" /><ref name="delev" /> Paternally, Ivan Alexander descended from the [[Asen dynasty]].<ref name="balgarite-2-1" /><ref name="delev" /> By 1330 Ivan Alexander was himself a ''despot<U+0113>s'' and governed the city of [[Lovech|Love<U+010D>]]. Together with his father and his father-in-law [[Basarab I of Wallachia|Basarab]] of [[Wallachia]], Ivan Alexander fought in the [[Battle of Velbazhd|Battle of Velb<U+01CE><U+017E>d]] against the Serbs at modern-day [[Kyustendil|Kjustendil]] in 1330, in which Bulgaria suffered defeat. The defeat, combined with the worsening relations with the Byzantine Empire, precipitated an internal crisis, which was exacerbated by an invasion of the Byzantines. A [[coup d'<U+00E9>tat]] drove [[Ivan Stephen of Bulgaria|Ivan Stefan]] out of the capital [[Veliko Tarnovo|T<U+01CE>rnovo]] in 1331, and the conspirators placed Ivan Alexander on the throne.<ref>Fine, ''Late Medieval Balkans'', p. 273.</ref>

[[Image:Ival-ivanovo-mural.jpg|left|130px|thumb|Contemporary mural portrait of Ivan Alexander from the [[Rock-hewn Churches of Ivanovo]]]]

The new ruler set about consolidating his position by regaining territories recently lost to the Byzantine Empire. In 1331 Ivan Alexander campaigned around [[Edirne|Adrianople]] and reconquered northeastern [[Thrace]].<ref name="balgarite-2-1" /><ref name="delev" /> Meanwhile, [[Stefan Uro<U+0161> IV Du<U+0161>an of Serbia|Stefan Uro<U+0161> IV Du<U+0161>an]] deposed his father [[Stefan Uro<U+0161> III De<U+010D>anski of Serbia|Stefan Uro<U+0161> III De<U+010D>anski]] and became [[List of Serbian monarchs|Serbian king]] in 1331. This helped normalize the previously tense relations between the two countries. Ivan Alexander and Stefan Uro<U+0161> IV Du<U+0161>an concluded an alliance, which was cemented by the marriage of the Serbian king to [[Helena of Bulgaria]], a sister of Ivan Alexander, on [[Easter]] 1332.<ref name="balgarite-2-1" /><ref name="delev" /><ref name="fine-p274">Fine, ''Late Medieval Balkans'', p. 274.</ref>

At about the same time, Belaur, a brother of Michael Asen III, rebelled in [[Vidin]], probably in support of his deposed nephew Ivan Stefan's claim to the throne. The advance of the Byzantine Emperor [[Andronikos III Palaiologos]] against Bulgaria in the summer of 1332 protracted military operations against the rebels. The Byzantines overran Bulgarian-controlled northeastern Thrace, but Ivan Alexander rushed southward with a small army and swiftly caught up with Andronikos III at Rusokastro.<ref name="fine-p274" />

After giving the impression that he wished to negotiate, Ivan Alexander, reinforced by [[Mongols|Mongol]] cavalry, overwhelmed the smaller but better organized Byzantine army in the [[Battle of Rusokastro]].<ref name="delev" /> The contested cities surrendered to Ivan Alexander, while Andronikos III sought refuge within the walls of Rusokastro. The war ended with Ivan Alexander meeting Andronikos and agreeing a peace based on the ''[[status quo]]''. To seal the alliance, he betrothed his eldest son, Michael Asen IV, to Andronikos's daughter Maria (Eirene), the marriage eventually taking place in 1339.<ref name="delev" /><ref>Bo<U+017E>ilov, ''Familijata na Asenevci'', pp. 192<U+2013>197.</ref> The Bulgarian emperor was now free to turn his attentions to Belaur, but it was not until 1336 or 1337 that the rebellion in the northwest was put down.<ref>Andreev, ''B<U+01CE>lgarija prez vtorata <U+010D>etv<U+01CE>rt na XIV v.'', pp. 33<U+2013>41.</ref>

In about 1332 Ivan Alexander had crowned his eldest son Michael Asen IV co-emperor, perhaps to safeguard possession of the throne by his own family. He followed up this traditional association with the coronation of his younger sons [[Ivan Sratsimir of Bulgaria|Ivan Sracimir]] and Ivan Asen IV in 1337. Ivan Alexander may have intended the creation of two younger co-emperors to establish immediate control over important cities and regions, as Ivan Sracimir was eventually based in Vidin, and Ivan Asen IV perhaps in [[Preslav]]. Nevertheless, this was a marked departure from Byzantine practice, in which younger sons of the sovereign were made ''despot<U+0113>s'', whether they were charged with a territorial administration or not.<ref>Andreev, ''B<U+01CE>lgarija prez vtorata <U+010D>etv<U+01CE>rt na XIV v.'', pp. 23<U+2013>52.</ref>

== Relations with the Byzantine Empire ==
{{see also|Byzantine-Bulgarian Wars}}
[[Image:Bulgaria Ivan Alexander (1331-1371).svg|right|thumb|350px|The Bulgarian lands during the reign of Ivan Alexander<ref>Based on Lalkov, ''Rulers of Bulgaria''</ref>]]

In the early 1340s relations with the Byzantine Empire temporarily deteriorated. Ivan Alexander demanded the extradition of his cousin <U+0160>i<U+0161>man, one of the sons of Michael Asen III, threatening the Byzantine government with war. Ivan Alexander's show of force backfired, as the Byzantines managed to see through his intentions and sent against him the fleet of their ally, the Turkish emir of [[Smyrna]] Umur Beg. Landing in the [[Danube Delta]], the Turks of Umur Beg pillaged the countryside and attacked nearby Bulgarian cities. Forced to restrain his demands, Ivan Alexander invaded the Byzantine Empire again at the end of 1341, claiming that he was summoned by the people of Adrianople.<ref>Bakalov, ''Istorija na B<U+01CE>lgarija'', "Esenta, 1341 g."</ref> However, Ivan Alexander's troops were defeated twice by Turkish allies of the Byzantines near the city.<ref>Fine, ''Late Medieval Balkans'', pp. 292<U+2013>293.</ref>

In 1341<U+2013>1347 the Byzantine Empire was plunged into a [[Byzantine civil war of 1341<U+2013>1347|protracted civil war]] between the regency for Emperor [[John V Palaiologos]] under [[Anna of Savoy]] and his intended guardian [[John VI Kantakouzenos]]. The neighbours of the Byzantines took advantage of the civil war, and while Stefan Uro<U+0161> IV Du<U+0161>an of Serbia sided with John VI Kantakouzenos, Ivan Alexander backed John V Palaiologos and his regency.<ref name="delev" /> Although the two Balkan rulers picked opposite sides in the Byzantine civil war, they maintained their alliance with each other. As the price for Ivan Alexander's support, the regency for John V Palaiologos ceded him the city of Philippopolis ([[Plovdiv]]) and nine important fortresses in the [[Rhodope Mountains]] in 1344.<ref name="lalkov-pp42-43" /><ref>Fine, ''Late Medieval Balkans'', p. 304.</ref> This peaceful turnover constituted the last major success of Ivan Alexander's foreign policy.

== Rise of Serbia and the Ottoman threat ==
{{see also|Serbian Empire|Rise of the Ottoman Empire|Bulgarian-Ottoman Wars}}
[[Image:SilverCoinIvanAlexanderBulgaria1331-1371.jpg|thumb|left|Silver coin of Ivan Alexander, Bulgaria, 1331<U+2013>1371]]

During the same period, the Serbian king took advantage of the Byzantine civil war to take possession of what is now [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], and of most of [[Albania]] and northern [[Greece]]. In 1345 he began to call himself "Emperor of Serbs and Greeks", and in 1346 he was crowned as such by the newly created [[Patriarch of Serbia]].<ref name="delev" /> These actions, which the Byzantines received with indignation, appear to have been supported by Bulgaria, as the [[Patriarch of Bulgaria]] Simeon had participated in both the creation of a [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Serbian patriarchate]] and the imperial coronation of Stefan Uro<U+0161> IV Du<U+0161>an.<ref>Fine, ''Late Medieval Balkans'', pp. 309<U+2013>310.</ref>

By the second half of the 1340s, little remained of Ivan Alexander's initial successes. John VI Kantakouzenos' Turkish allies pillaged parts of Bulgarian Thrace in 1346, 1347, 1349, 1352 and 1354, to which were added the ravages of the Black Death.<ref>Fine, ''Late Medieval Balkans'', pp. 322, 325, 328.</ref> The Bulgarians' attempts to repel the invaders met with repeated failure, and Ivan Alexander's third son and co-emperor, Ivan Asen IV, was killed in battle against the Turks in 1349, as was his older brother [[Michael Asen IV <U+043E>f Bulgaria|Michael Asen IV]] in 1355 or a little earlier.<ref>Andreev, ''B<U+01CE>lgarija prez vtorata <U+010D>etv<U+01CE>rt na XIV v.'', pp. 67<U+2013>75.</ref>

By 1351 the Byzantine civil war was over, and John VI Kantakouzenos had realized the threat posed by the Ottomans to the [[Balkans|Balkan Peninsula]]. He appealed to the rulers of Serbia and Bulgaria for a united effort against the Turks and asked Ivan Alexander for money to construct warships,<ref name="delev" /><ref name="balgarite-2-2">''B<U+01CE>lgarite i B<U+01CE>lgarija'', 2.2</ref> but his appeals fell on deaf ears as his neighbours distrusted his intentions.<ref>Fine, ''Late Medieval Balkans'', p. 325.</ref> A new attempt for cooperation between Bulgaria and the Byzantine Empire followed in 1355,<ref>Bakalov, ''Istorija na B<U+01CE>lgarija'', "1355 g."</ref> after John VI Kantakouzenos had been forced to abdicate and John V Palaiologos had been established as supreme emperor. To cement the treaty, Ivan Alexander's daughter [[Keratsa of Bulgaria|Keraca Marija]]<ref name=srednovek>{{cite book|title=Istorija na srednovekovna B<U+01CE>lgarija VII-XIV vek (tom 1)|last=Bo<U+017E>ilov|first=Ivan|coauthors=Vasil Gjuzelev|year=2006|publisher=Anubis|isbn=9544262040|language=Bulgarian|ISBN-status=May be invalid - please double check}}</ref> was married off to the future Byzantine Emperor [[Andronikos IV Palaiologos]],<ref name="lalkov-pp42-43" /> but the alliance failed to produce concrete results.<ref>Bo<U+017E>ilov, ''Familijata na Asenevci'', pp. 218<U+2013>224.</ref>

== Further stability problems and external conflicts ==
[[Image:Coin Ivan Alexander with Michael Asen IV.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Coin depicting Ivan Alexander with one of his sons, co-emperor Michael Asen IV (right)]]

At home Ivan Alexander compromised the internal stability of his realm by divorcing his first wife [[Theodora of Wallachia]] (in about 1349) and marrying a converted [[Jew]], also named [[Sarah (Theodora)|Theodora]].<ref name="delev" /> The new marriage produced new sons, whom Ivan Alexander proceeded to crown co-emperors, Ivan <U+0160>i<U+0161>man in about 1356 and Ivan Asen V by 1359. Ivan Alexander's last surviving son from his first marriage, the co-emperor Ivan Sracimir, became effectively independent around 1356;<ref name="delev" /> and Ivan Alexander's control over other powerful vassals, such as the rulers of [[Wallachia]] and [[Dobruja]], who pursued their own foreign policies, was hardly stronger.<ref name="fine-p366">Fine, ''Late Medieval Balkans'', p. 366.</ref>

From the middle of the 14th century, Bulgaria fell prey to the aspirations of the [[Capetian House of Anjou|Angevin]] king [[Louis I of Hungary]], who annexed [[Moldavia]] in 1352 and established a vassal principality there, before [[Hungarian occupation of Vidin|conquering Vidin]] in 1365,<ref name="delev" /><ref name="balgarite-2-2" /> and taking Ivan Sratsimir and his family into captivity.<ref name="delev" /><ref name="fine-p366" />

[[Image:Military campaign of Amadeus VI against Bulgaria (1366-67).png|left|thumb|200px|Military campaign of Amadeus VI against Bulgaria (1366<U+2013>67)]]

In the meantime Bulgarians and Byzantines had clashed again in 1364. In 1366, when Emperor John V Palaiologos was returning from his trip to the west, the Bulgarians refused to let him pass through Bulgaria. This stance backfired, as another Byzantine ally, Count [[Amadeus VI, Count of Savoy|Amadeus VI of Savoy]], captured several Bulgarian maritime cities in retaliation, including Ankhialos ([[Pomorie]]) and Mesembria ([[Nesebar|Neseb<U+01CE>r]]), though he failed to take [[Varna]]. Outmanoeuvred, Ivan Alexander was forced to make peace.<ref>Fine, ''Late Medieval Balkans'', p. 367.</ref>

The captured cities were turned over to the Byzantine Empire, while Emperor John V Palaiologos paid the sum of 180,000 [[Italian coin florin|florins]] to Ivan Alexander.<ref name="delev" /> The Bulgarian emperor used this sum and territorial concessions to induce his at least ''[[de jure]]'' vassals [[Dobrotitsa|Dobrotica]] of Dobruja<ref>Bakalov, ''Istorija na B<U+01CE>lgarija'', "Dobrotica (neizv.<U+2013>okolo 1385)"</ref> and [[Vladislav I of Wallachia]]<ref>{{cite book|title=Politi<U+010D>eska geografija na srednovekovnata b<U+01CE>lgarska d<U+01CE>r<U+017E>ava 2 (1186<U+2013>1396)|last=Koledarov|first=Pet<U+01CE>r|publisher=[[Bulgarian Academy of Sciences]]|year=1989|pages=13<U+2013>25, 102|language=Bulgarian}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Dako-rom<U+01CE>nite i tjahnata slavjanska pismenost.

The relatively successful resolution of the crisis in the northwest did nothing to help recover the losses in the southeast. To make matters worse, in 1369 (the date is disputed), the Ottoman Turks under [[Murad I]] conquered Adrianople (in 1363) and made it the effective capital of their expanding state. At the same time, they also captured the Bulgarian cities of Philippopolis and Boruj ([[Stara Zagora]]).<ref>Tjutjund<U+017E>iev and Pavlov, ''B<U+01CE>lgarskata d<U+01CE>r<U+017E>ava i osmanskata ekspanzija''</ref> As Bulgaria and the Serbian princes in Macedonia prepared for united action against the Turks, Ivan Alexander died on February 17, 1371.<ref>Fine, ''Late Medieval Balkans'', p. 368.</ref> He was succeeded by his sons Ivan Sracimir in Vidin<ref name="balgarite-2-2" /> and Ivan <U+0160>i<U+0161>man in T<U+01CE>rnovo,<ref name="balgarite-2-2" /> while the rulers of Dobruja and Wallachia achieved further independence.

The spiritual practice of [[hesychasm]], a form of incantatory prayer, deeply influenced certain areas of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] world of the 14th century. A notable Bulgarian representative of the movement during Ivan Alexander's reign was [[Theodosius of Tarnovo|Theodosius of T<U+01CE>rnovo]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pravoslavieto.com/life/11.27_sv_Teofosij_Turnovski.htm|title=Sv. prepodobni Teodosij T<U+01CE>rnovski|publisher=Pravoslavieto.com|accessdate=2007-01-19|language=Bulgarian}}</ref>

During this time, the Bulgarian Empire had trade relations with the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] maritime powers [[Republic of Venice|Venice]], [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]] and [[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusa]].<ref>{{cite book|title=B<U+01CE>lgarska enciklopedija A-JA&nbsp;<U+2013> treto os<U+01CE>vremeneno izdanie|publisher=Trud, Sirma|chapter=Ivan Aleksand<U+01CE>r Asen (?<U+2013>1371)|year=2005|location=Sofia|isbn=9545285192|language=Bulgarian|author=glaven red.: Evgeni Golovinski|ISBN-status=May be invalid - please double check}}</ref> In 1353, Ivan Alexander issued a charter allowing Venetian merchants to buy and sell goods throughout Bulgaria after [[Doge of Venice|Doge]] [[Andrea Dandolo]] assured him they would observe the prior treaties between the two countries.<ref>Bakalov, ''Istorija na B<U+01CE>lgarija'', "Venecianska gramota"</ref>

In modern times, the rule of Ivan Alexander inspired Bulgarian national writer [[Ivan Vazov]] to write the [[novelette]] ''Ivan-Aleksand<U+01CE>r''<ref name=slovoto>{{cite web|url=http://www.slovo.bg/showbio.php3?ID=14|title=Biografi<U+010D>ni bele<U+017E>ki&nbsp;<U+2013> Ivan Vazov|publisher=Slovoto|language=Bulgarian|accessdate=2007-01-19}}</ref> and the [[drama]] ''K<U+01CE>m propast'' (''Towards an Abyss''),<ref name=slovoto/> in both of which the tsar is the main character.

A piece of a garment signed by Ivan Alexander and interwoven with gold was discovered in a noble's grave near [[Pirot]] in the 1970s; today it is preserved in the [[National Museum of Serbia]] in [[Belgrade]]. It is the first find of its kind, demonstrating a medieval tradition attested in writing according to which Orthodox rulers would present their most eminent dignitaries with a piece of a garment they had worn.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://bgarmy.eamci.bg/Scripts/isapiVWB.dll/doc?THEMEID=14930|title=Otkrita e unikalna zlatotkana dreha na Car Ivan Aleksand<U+01CE>r|last=Beni<U+0161>eva|first=Daniela|publisher=B<U+01CE>lgarska armija|date=2002-11-18|accessdate=2007-02-03|language=Bulgarian|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070930224151/http://bgarmy.eamci.bg/Scripts/isapiVWB.dll/doc?THEMEID=14930 |archivedate = September 30, 2007|deadurl=yes}}</ref>
