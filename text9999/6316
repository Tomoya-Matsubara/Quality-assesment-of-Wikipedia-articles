'''Cyber ShockWave''', similar to the [[Cyber Storm Exercise]],  was a 4-hour [[Military simulation|wargame]] conducted by the Washington, D.C.

==Background==

[[Cyberwarfare]] has become a major threat to the [[United States]].<ref name= NPR>NPR staff, (June-16, 2010), {{cite web | title= Has The Cyberwar Threat Been Exaggerated? | url= http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=127861446 | publisher= [[NPR]] | accessdate= 2010-10-03}}</ref> There is current debate over whether cyberwarfare constitutes actual war or a rhetorical and less threatening concept instead. Control of the Internet has long been an issue of Internet security and electronic privacy.<ref name="NPR"/><ref name="Foreign Affairs">{{cite web | title= Who Will Control the Internet? | url=  http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/61192/kenneth-neil-cukier/who-will-control-the-internet | publisher= [[Foreign Affairs]] | accessdate= 2010-10-30}}</ref>

The Cyber Shockwave [[simulation game]] was developed in partnership with [[General Dynamics Advanced Information Systems]], SMobile Systems, [[Southern Company]] and [[Georgetown University]].<ref name="PR Newswire">{{cite web | title= Cyber ShockWave Hits Washington | url= http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cyber-shockwave-hits-washington-83570087.html | publisher= [[PR Newswire]] | accessdate= 2010-10-28}}</ref> It was created by former CIA Director General [[Michael Hayden]] and conducted by the Bipartisan Policy Center to give a glimpse of what would happen during a [[cyber attack]] and gauged whether or not the [[United States]] was prepared for it. Security agents and lawmakers played roles in the fabricated attacks. The participants did not know the scenario in advance which helped to maintain the reality of a surprise attack. If a real attack were to happen it would come without notice and lawmakers and government agencies would have to re-act immediately in a timely manner.<ref name="Bipartisan Policy Center">{{cite web | title= Cyber ShockWave Shows U.S. Unprepared For Cyber Threats | url= http://www.bipartisanpolicy.org/news/press-releases/2010/02/cyber-shockwave-shows-us-unprepared-cyber-threats | publisher= [[Bipartisan Policy Center]] | accessdate= 2010-10-03}}</ref>

To prepare for a possible attack, members of [[The White House]], Cabinet Members and [[National Security Agency|National Security Agencies]] plan to advise President [[Barack Obama]] on possible plans of actions.<ref name="Kings of War">{{cite web | title= Coming to a Networked Device Near You: Cyberwar! | url= http://kingsofwar.org.uk/2010/02/coming-to-a-networked-device-near-you-cyberwar/ | publisher= Kings of War | accessdate= 2010-10-16}}</ref>

==Simulation attack==

One of the simulation attacks that was presented was a Malware program planted into phones during a popular basketball game. This attack caused a disruption spanning over many [[mobile phones]] across the [[United States]]. The [[spyware]] planted on to the smartphones were used through a key logger and data intercepts to funnel funds to banks overseas. Several bots appear downloading videos that shows 'The Red Army.'<ref name="The Tech Herald">{{cite web | title= Report: The Cyber ShockWave event and its aftermath | url= http://www.thetechherald.com/article.php/201007/5245/Report-The-Cyber-ShockWave-event-and-its-aftermath | publisher= The Tech Herald | accessdate= 2010-10-28}}</ref> When someone receives the [[Spyware]], it is sent to the person's contact and the contacts will open it, spreading the malicious virus everywhere.<ref name="The Washington Post">{{cite news | title= War game reveals U.S. lacks cyber-crisis skills | url= http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/02/16/AR2010021605762.html | publisher= The Washington Post | accessdate= 2010-10-28 | first=Ellen | last=Nakashima | date=2010-02-17}}</ref>

In addition, the Cyber attack reportedly sparked a series of crises and provisions including:<ref name="The Washington Post">{{cite news | title= War game reveals U.S. lacks cyber-crisis skills | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/02/16/AR2010021605762.html | publisher= Tao Security | accessdate= 2010-10-28 | first=Ellen | last=Nakashima | date=2010-02-17}}</ref>

*40 million people without power in the [[Eastern United States]]
*More than 60 million cellphones out of service
*[[Wall Street]] closed for a week
*[[Capitol Hill]] leaders en route to the White House

==Results==

The results of the Cyber ShockWave war game showed that the [[United States]] is unprepared for a [[cyber attack]]. The results highlighted the immediate dangers that are threatening the country. Finally, the game demonstrates there would be huge financial repercussions to a cyber attack.<ref name="The Washington Post">{{cite news | title= War game reveals U.S. lacks cyber-crisis skills | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/02/16/AR2010021605762.html | publisher= The Washington Post | accessdate= 2010-10-28 | first=Ellen | last=Nakashima | date=2010-02-17}}</ref><ref name="Bipartisan Policy Center"/>

The simulation revealed that the response speed is crucial during a cyber attack and that the planning deficiency in which the [[United States]] exhibited during the game can be extremely costly.<ref name="Tao Security">{{cite web | title= Reaction to Cyber Shockwave | url= http://taosecurity.blogspot.com/2010/02/reaction-to-cyber-shockwave.html | publisher= Tao Security | accessdate= 2010-10-16}}</ref> The [[simulation]] also showed that the fast speed of an attack leaves little time to better understand certain things such as the essence of the attack, provided it were to happen, or proper recovery methods.<ref name="Tao Security"/> Former [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]] press secretary [[Joe Lockhart]] added that the simulation Shockwave may cause a panic among people but it's in fact a good thing.<ref name="The Washington Post"/>

According to [[Secretary of Homeland Security]], [[Michael Chertoff]] the United States lacks in several key aspects of Cyber security:<ref name="Government Computer News|GCN">{{cite web | title= War game reveals U.S. lacks cyber-crisis skills | url= http://gcn.com/Articles/2010/03/15/Commentary-Chertoff-Cyber-ShockWave.aspx?Page=2 | publisher= Government Computer News|GCN | accessdate= 2010-10-28}}</ref>

* Well-defined responsibilities for maintaining common situational awareness of emerging critical operational developments in cyberspace
* An effective decision-making framework below the Cabinet level for coordinating the government's response and recovery from a devastating cyber event.
* A user-friendly process to allow government cyber defenders to effectively collaborate with the private sector to take advantage of their expertise and knowledge during the response to a cyberattack
