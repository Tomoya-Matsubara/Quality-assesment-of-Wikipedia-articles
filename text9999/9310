'''''The Itchy & Scratchy Show''''' is a [[Story within a story|show within a show]] in the [[animated television series]] ''[[The Simpsons]]''. It usually appears as a part of ''The [[Krusty the Clown]] Show'', watched regularly by [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] and [[Lisa Simpson]]. Itself an animated cartoon, ''The Itchy & Scratchy Show'' depicts an [[anthropomorphic]] blue [[mouse]], Itchy (voiced by [[Dan Castellaneta]]), who repeatedly kills an anthropomorphic [[black cat]], Scratchy (voiced by [[Harry Shearer]]), making it a parody of [[Tom and Jerry]]. The cartoon first appeared in the ''[[The Tracey Ullman Show|Tracey Ullman Show]]'' [[The Simpsons shorts|short]] "The Bart Simpson Show", which originally aired November 20, 1988. The cartoon's first appearance in ''The Simpsons'' was in the 1990 episode "[[There's No Disgrace Like Home]]". Typically presented as 15-60 second-long cartoons, the show is filled with over-the-top violence. ''The Simpsons'' also occasionally features characters who are involved with the production of ''The Itchy & Scratchy Show'', including Roger Meyers, Jr. (voiced by [[Alex Rocco]] and [[Hank Azaria]]), who runs the studio and produces the show.

Itchy and Scratchy are based on the cartoons ''[[Tom and Jerry]]'' and ''[[Herman and Katnip]]'', and their names were inspired by "Pixie and Dixie", who were mice on the cartoon show ''[[Pixie and Dixie and Mr. Jinks]]''. The cartoons have since become popular among the show's writers and animators and are often added when an episode needs expanding. As the shorts became popular with fans, the writers decided to have full episodes that centered around the production of ''The Itchy & Scratchy Show'' and featured multiple shorts. The first was "[[Itchy & Scratchy & Marge]]" ([[The Simpsons (season 2)|season two]], 1990), which was a commentary on censorship. Other episodes to feature the show include "[[Itchy & Scratchy: The Movie]]" ([[The Simpsons (season 4)|season four]], 1992), "[[The Front (The Simpsons)|The Front]]" ([[The Simpsons (season 4)|season four]], 1993), "[[Itchy & Scratchy Land]]" ([[The Simpsons (season 6)|season six]], 1994), "[[The Day the Violence Died]]" ([[The Simpsons (season 7)|season seven]], 1996) and "[[The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show]]" ([[The Simpsons (season 8)|season eight]], 1997).

''The Itchy & Scratchy Show'' is a [[Story within a story|show within a show]] that appears occasionally in episodes of ''The Simpsons''. They typically appear in the form of 15-60 second cartoons that are filled with over-the-top violence, usually initiated by Itchy the mouse against  Scratchy the cat; Itchy is almost always the victor.<ref name="#Turner|Turner, pp. 33<U+2013>34">[[#Turner|Turner]], pp. 33<U+2013>34</ref> A complex backstory for the show has been established. The episode "[[The Day the Violence Died]]" ([[The Simpsons (season 7)|season seven]], 1996) reveals that Chester J. Lampwick invented Itchy in 1919, but the character was stolen by Roger Meyers.<ref name="Violence">{{cite episode|title=The Day the Violence Died|episodelink=The Day the Violence Died|series=The Simpsons|credits=Swartzwelder, John; Archer, Wes|network=Fox|airdate=1996-03-17|season=07|number=18}}</ref> Scratchy starred in his first cartoon in 1928, entitled ''That Happy Cat''. The film, a 13-second-long animation showing the cat whistling and tipping his hat, did very poorly commercially. Later that year, Itchy and Scratchy starred in their first cartoon together entitled ''Steamboat Itchy'', a violent parody of [[Disney]]'s ''[[Steamboat Willie]]''.<ref name="The Movie">{{cite episode|title=The Day the Violence Died|episodelink=The Day the Violence Died|series=The Simpsons|credits=Swartzwelder, John; Moore, Rich|network=Fox|airdate=1992-11-03|season=04|number=06}}</ref> Along with the cartoon shorts, Itchy and Scratchy were featured in a [[World War II|wartime]] radio series,<ref>{{cite episode|title=The Old Man and the Key|episodelink=The Old Man and the Key|series=The Simpsons|credits=Vitti, Jon; Kramer, Lance|network=Fox|airdate=2002-03-10|season=13|number=13}}</ref> at least two films<U+2014>''Pinitchio'' and ''Scratchtasia'',<ref name="Land">{{cite episode|title=Itchy & Scratchy Land|episodelink=Itchy & Scratchy Land|series=The Simpsons|credits=Swartzwelder, John; Archer, Wes|network=Fox |airdate=1994-10-02 |season=06|number=04}}</ref> and television commercials for [[List of products in The Simpsons#Laramie Cigarettes|Laramie Cigarettes]].<ref>{{cite episode |title=HOMR|episodelink=HOMR|series=The Simpsons |credits=Jean, Al; [[Mike B.

Itchy and Scratchy Studios is run by Roger Meyers, Jr., the son of Roger Meyers, the cartoon's "creator". Itchy and Scratchy Studios was bankrupted after it was sued by Lampwick for $800 billion, but was saved after receiving a large cash settlement from the government over its use of [[Mr. ZIP]].<ref name="Violence"/> ''The Itchy and Scratchy Show'' airs as a segment on the [[Krusty the Klown]] show, but moved to the [[Krusty Gets Kancelled|Gabbo]] show during the latter's short-lived run.<ref name="KGK">{{cite episode|title=Krusty Gets Kancelled|episodelink=Krusty Gets Kancelled|series=The Simpsons |credits=Swartzwelder, John; Silverman, David|network=Fox|airdate=1993-05-13|season=04|number=22}}</ref> The show underwent a non-violent retooling following a protest campaign led by [[Marge Simpson]], but after Marge was later discredited, it returned to its original violent format.<ref name="And Marge">{{cite episode|title=Itchy & Scratchy & Marge|episodelink=Itchy & Scratchy & Marge|series=The Simpsons|credits=Swartzwelder, John; Reardon, Jim|network=Fox|airdate=1990-12-20|season=02|number=09}}</ref> The show has spawned an [[Academy Award]]-winning film adaptation,<ref name="The Movie"/> amusement parks,<ref name="Land"/> and a musical.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Girls Just Want to Have Sums|episodelink=Girls Just Want to Have Sums|series=The Simpsons|credits=Selman, Matt; Kruse, Nancy|network=Fox |airdate=2006-04-30|season=17|number=19}}</ref>

The Itchy & Scratchy show is usually a parody of traditional cartoons or takeoffs on famous films, but the plot and content are always violent. The most direct and obvious example is ''[[Tom and Jerry]]'', an animated series which was also about a constant battle between a cat and a mouse, with the mouse usually victorious. ''Itchy and Scratchy'' also includes shorts such as "Scratchtasia", a parody of ''[[Fantasia (film)|Fantasia]]'', and "Pinitchio", a parody of ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]''.<ref name="Groening2">{{cite video|people=Groening, Matt|date=2004|title=The Simpsons season 4 DVD commentary for the episode "Itchy & Scratchy & Marge"|medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> Itchy & Scratchy are often used for animation-related jokes. For example, the ''Manhattan Madness'' cartoon in "The Day the Violence Died" is based on very early animated cartoons such as ''[[Gertie the Dinosaur]]''.<ref name="TDTVD"/> Itchy and Scratchy often play out an exaggerated form of the conflict in the surrounding episode. For example, in "[[Deep Space Homer]]" ([[The Simpsons (season 5)|season five]], 1994), Homer is recruited by [[NASA]], and later watches an Itchy and Scratchy cartoon which directly (and gruesomely) parodies the films ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' and ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/simpsons/episodeguide/season5/page15.shtml|title=Deep Space Homer|accessdate=2007-09-26|author=Martyn, Warren; Wood, Adrian|year=2000|publisher=BBC}}</ref>

==Characters==
===''The Itchy & Scratchy Show''===
'''Itchy and Scratchy''' are the main characters in the show. The duo first appeared in ''[[The Tracey Ullman Show]]'' [[The Simpsons shorts|short]] "The Bart Simpson Show", which aired November 20, 1988. Their first appearance in ''The Simpsons'' was "[[There's No Disgrace Like Home]]".<ref name="tvguide"/> Itchy, voiced by [[Dan Castellaneta]], is a [[blue]] [[mouse]], and usually the aggressor and the victor over the hapless Scratchy in their battles. An exception is in "[[Homer Goes to College]]" ([[The Simpsons (season 5)|season five]], 1993). Bart and Lisa watch a cartoon called "Burning Down the Mouse", as Lisa puts it, "This is the one where Scratchy finally gets Itchy." However, due to the Simpsons' television being unplugged, the viewer does not see the end of the cartoon and Krusty proclaims that the network will never let it be shown again.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Homer Goes to College|episodelink=Homer Goes to College|series=The Simpsons|credits=O'Brien, Conan; Reardon, Jim|network=Fox |airdate=1993-10-14|season=05|number=03}}</ref> Scratchy, voiced by [[Harry Shearer]], is a [[black cat]] and is the victim of much abuse from the [[Sadistic personality disorder|sadistic]] Itchy. The writers often forget which character is which; a trick they use is that Scratchy contains the letters c, a and t.<ref name="tvguide"/>

'''Poochie''', voiced by [[Dan Castellaneta]], is an anthropomorphic dog that appeared in "[[The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show]]" ([[The Simpsons (season 8)|season eight]], 1997). In the episode, the producers of ''The Itchy & Scratchy Show'' believed the cartoons were getting stale, and needed a new character to reinvigorate the show. [[Homer Simpson]] gets the job of voicing Poochie, who is introduced in the cartoon, "The Beagle Has Landed". A product of marketing department thinking, Poochie was near-universally despised, and was killed off in his second appearance, despite Homer's objections. The episode was both a reference to TV shows which added new characters purportedly to reinvigorate the show, and a commentary on the growing complaints of fans of ''The Simpsons''. The original idea for the episode was that Poochie would be obnoxious because he was so rich, rather than because he was so cool.<ref name="TISPS"/> Poochie would later make brief speaking cameo appearances in "[[Treehouse of Horror IX]]" and "[[Little Big Mom]]".<ref name="TISPS"/><ref>{{cite episode |title=Little Big Mom|episodelink=Little Big Mom|series=The Simpsons |credits=Omine, Carolyn; Kirkland, Mark|network=Fox|airdate=2000-01-14|season=09|number=10}}</ref>

===Production staff===
[[Image:RogerMeyers.png|right|200px|thumb|Roger Meyers, Jr. in his first appearance in "Itchy & Scratchy & Marge"]]
'''Roger Meyers, Jr.''', voiced by [[Alex Rocco]] and [[Hank Azaria]], is the [[chairman]] and CEO of Itchy & Scratchy Studios and is the son of Roger Meyers.<ref name="And Marge"/> He first appeared in "[[Itchy & Scratchy & Marge]]" ([[The Simpsons (season 2)|season two]], 1990). He distributes the cartoon and is a jaded and selfish businessman who has nothing but contempt for the children who comprise his audience.<ref name="Poochie">{{cite episode |title=The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show|episodelink=The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show|series=The Simpsons |credits=Cohen, David S.; Moore, Steven Dean|network=Fox |airdate=1997-02-09|season=08|number=14}}</ref> He also possesses an extremely obnoxious personality, where he only cares about people who can help him. This is displayed in his contempt for the writers of ''The Itchy & Scratchy Show''.<ref name="Front"/>

Alex Rocco also voices Meyers in "The Day the Violence Died" and "The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show". He said that he liked voicing Meyers because "I get to be a big-shot."<ref name="Rocco">Rocco, Alex (2006). Commentary for "[[The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show]]", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Eighth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref> However, he professed being nervous when voicing the character for the first time in "[[Itchy & Scratchy & Marge]]" because he said that he had never done a [[voice-over]] before. At first he tried doing a special voice, but was told to "just be yourself."<ref name="Rocco"/> Rocco was one of Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein's favorite guest stars, and they liked including him in their episodes so they could "have a little fun with him."<ref name="TDTVD"/> On occasions when Rocco was unavailable to do a voice over, Meyers was voiced by [[Hank Azaria]] in "[[The Front (The Simpsons)|The Front]]" ([[The Simpsons (season 4)|season four]], 1993), "[[Lady Bouvier's Lover]]" ([[The Simpsons (season 5)|season five]], 1994) and "Itchy & Scratchy Land".<ref name="TF"/>

The spelling of Meyers' name has been inconsistent in the show. His last name was spelt both Myers and Meyers in "Itchy & Scratchy & Marge", and Myers the later episode "The Day the Violence Died".<ref name="Violence"/><ref name="And Marge"/> His name is spelt Meyers in "The Front", as well as in the book ''[[The Simpsons: A Complete Guide to Our Favorite Family]]''.<ref name="Front">{{cite episode |title=The Front |episodelink=The Front (The Simpsons)|series=The Simpsons |credits=Lapidus, Adam I.; Moore, Rich|network=Fox |airdate=1993-04-15|season=04|number=19}}</ref><ref>[[#Richmond|Richmond]], p. 43</ref>

'''Roger Meyers, Sr.''' first appeared in video footage in "Itchy & Scratchy Land" and has never had a speaking role. He was created because the writers felt it would have been "tortured logic" to have the Roger Meyers, Jr. be the creator.<ref name="TDTVD"/> Roger Meyers Sr has similarities to [[Walt Disney]].<ref name="ISL"/> For example, Disney's alleged [[antisemitism]] is spoofed when it is revealed that Meyers made a cartoon called ''Nazi Supermen are our Superiors''.<ref name=EW>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,417748_2,00.html|title=The Family Dynamic|accessdate=2008-12-12|date=2003-01-29|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]}}</ref>

'''June Bellamy''', voiced by [[Tress MacNeille]], is the actress who portrays both Itchy and Scratchy. Her only appearance was in "The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show". It is assumed she is a reference to veteran voice actress [[June Foray]], based on the same first name. In the episode, Bellamy states that a woman voiced the characters, although Itchy and Scratchy are voiced by male actors.<ref name="TISPS"/>

'''Chester J. Lampwick''', voiced by [[Kirk Douglas]], is the creator of Itchy and only appeared in "The Day the Violence Died". Douglas was not the producers' first choice for the character, they first wanted [[William Hickey (actor)|William Hickey]], but he turned them down.<ref name="TDTVD"/> Douglas's recording session was fraught with interruptions because he refused to wear the earphones supplied to him in the recording studio, and said the maximum he would do was two takes.<ref>{{cite book |title= My Life as a 10-Year-Old Boy|last= Cartwright|first= Nancy|authorlink= Nancy Cartwright|chapter= Spartacus!|pages=222<U+2013>228|year= 2000|publisher=[[Hyperion (publisher)|Hyperion]]|location=New York City|id=ISBN 0-7868-8600-5}}</ref>

'''Writing staff''': In several episodes revolving around the production of ''The Itchy & Scratchy Show'', caricatures of the show's staff are used as the staff of ''The Itchy & Scratchy Show''. This first occurred in "Itchy & Scratchy & Marge" where caricatures of animators [[David Silverman]], [[Wes Archer]] and [[Rich Moore]] can be seen.<ref name="ISM"/> In "The Front" many of the show's writers were used, this in-joke was purely an idea of the animators. [[John Swartzwelder]], [[George Meyer]], [[Jeff Martin (writer)|Jeff Martin]], [[Al Jean]], [[Sam Simon]], [[Jon Vitti]] and [[Mike Reiss (comedy writer)|Mike Reiss]] all appeared in the episode.<ref name="TF">Groening, Matt; Jean, Al; Lapidus, Adam I.; Reiss, Mike; Moore, Rich.

Almost all of the writers shown are caricatures of the actual staff of ''The Simpsons''. At the production table, [[David X. Cohen]], [[Bill Oakley]], [[Josh Weinstein]] are shown, while Meyer speaks out and gets fired. The animator shown designing Poochie is Silverman. Others who appear include [[Dan McGrath]], [[Ian Maxtone-Graham]], [[Donick Cary]], [[Ron Hauge]], [[Ned Goldreyer]] and [[Mike Scully]].<ref name="TISPS"/>

===Origins===
[[Image:Itchyscratchy.png|right|200px|thumb|Itchy and Scratchy in their first appearance in "The Bart Simpson Show"]]
''The Itchy & Scratchy Show'' first appeared in the ''[[The Tracey Ullman Show|Tracey Ullman Show]]'' [[The Simpsons shorts|short]] "The Bart Simpson Show", which originally aired November 20, 1988. They were the first major recurring characters outside of the Simpson family to appear.<ref>[[#Richmond|Richmond]], pp. 14<U+2013>15</ref> They are based on ''[[Tom and Jerry]]'' and other cat and mouse cartoons. As a child, series creator [[Matt Groening]] and his friends would fantasize about an ultra violent cartoon and how much fun it would be to work on a show like that.<ref name="tvguide">{{cite news|title=Flash! 24 Simpsons Stars Reveal Themselves|accessdate=2007-08-15|date=2000-10-21|publisher=''[[TV Guide]]''|author=Joe Rhodes}}</ref><ref name="Groening1">{{cite video | people=Groening, Matt|date=2002|title=The Simpsons season 2 DVD commentary for the episode "Itchy & Scratchy & Marge"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> The names "Itchy" and "Scratchy" were inspired by "Pixie and Dixie", who were mice on the cartoon show ''[[Pixie and Dixie and Mr. Jinks]]''.<ref name="Groening1"/> The show is also based on ''[[Herman and Katnip]]'', a show that, according to director [[David Silverman]], "is hilarious because it's just bad".<ref name="ISM"/><ref name="silverman">{{cite web | url = http://cagle.msnbc.com/hogan/interviews/silverman.asp | title = The David Silverman Interview|publisher=[[MSNBC]] | accessdate = 2008-12-02|year=2004|author=Heintjes, Tom}}</ref> As a child, Groening really liked the 1961 Disney film ''[[One Hundred and One Dalmatians]]'', and it was one of the reasons to why he got into cartooning.<ref name="Greyhound"/> In the film, the puppies watch television in the course of the film, and the idea that it is possible have a cartoon within a cartoon thrilled Groening.

David Silverman states that Itchy and Scratchy cartoons are "an ironic commentary on cartoon mayhem in the sense that it's taken to a more realistic level. The kids on The Simpsons are laughing at it, and we're laughing too, but part of what you're laughing at is the over-the-top excessiveness of the violence."<ref name="silverman"/>

During his tenure as showrunner ([[The Simpsons (season 5)|season five]] and [[The Simpsons (season 6)|six]]) David Mirkin was asked by the Fox network not to do any more Itchy & Scratchy cartoons due to the amount of violence in them. In response, the show produced "Itchy & Scratchy Land". The network asked them not to do the episode, and threatened that if the episode was produced, they would cut the Itchy & Scratchy parts out themselves, but relented when Mirkin threatened to tell the media. The writers nevertheless promised to try not to overdo the violence and in some scenes the violence was cut.<ref name="ISL">Mirkin, David.

During their tenure as executive producers, [[Bill Oakley]] and [[Josh Weinstein]] tried to fit in one episode relating to ''The Itchy & Scratchy Show'' every season. They note that as the seasons went on, it became harder and harder for them to come up with new Itchy & Scratchy episode ideas.<ref name="TDTVD">Oakley, Bill; Weinstein, Josh.
