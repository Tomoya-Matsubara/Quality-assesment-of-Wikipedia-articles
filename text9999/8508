'''New York State Route 321''' is a minor thoroughfare in the county of [[Onondaga County, New York|Onondaga]]. It begins at an intersection with [[U.S. Route 20]] in the [[Skaneateles (village), New York|village of Skaneateles]]. The highway heads to the north and to the east, intersecting with County Route 107 in the outlying town of Skaneateles. Route 321 intersects with Forward Road and becomes concurrent with County Route 66 (Bennetts Corners Road). The state designation terminates at an intersection with [[New York State Route 5]] in Bennetts Corners, where Route 66 continues northward to [[Memphis, New York|Memphis]].

Route 321 dates back to the [[1920s]] as [[New York State Route 26 (1924)|New York State Route 26]]. The designation was changed to 321 along part of Route 26 in the [[1930 New York State Route renumbering]]. 

== Route description ==
Route 321 begins at an intersection with [[U.S. Route 20 in New York|U.S. Route 20]] (West Genesee Street) in the [[Onondaga County, New York|Onondaga County]] village of [[Skaneateles (village), New York|Skaneateles]].<ref name="google">{{cite map|publisher=[[Google Maps]]|url=http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&rlz=1T4ADBF_enUS232US232&q=from:+RT-321/State+St+%4042.945680,+-76.427820+to:+RT-321/State+St+Rd+%4042.972188,+-76.427292+to:RT-321+%4043.017728,+-76.391045+to:RT-321+%4043.018590,+-76.375380+to:RT-321+%4043.023301,+-76.361964+to:Bennetts+Corners+Rd/RT-321+%4043.034491,+-76.365253&um=1&ie=UTF-8&sa=N&tab=wl|title=Overview Map of NY 321|accessdate=2007-12-04}}</ref> The highway, at first, heads northward, intersecting with local streets in the village. After leaving the village and entering [[Skaneateles (town), New York|the town of the same name]], the highway intersects with the Old Seneca Turnpike (CR 133). Route 321 continues northward, intersecting with several county routes, including Halfway Road (CR 107; former [[New York State Route 368|NY 368]]) south of the [[Elbridge (town), New York|Elbridge]] hamlet of Halfway. Soon afterwards, Route 321 turns to the northeast, heading towards [[New York State Route 5|NY 5]]. The highway intersects Forward Road (unsigned NY 931F) just inside the [[Camillus (town), New York|Camillus]] town line soon after the turn.<ref name="google"/>

Past Forward Road, Route 321 becomes concurrent with County Route 66 as maintenance of the roadway shifts from the [[New York State Department of Transportation]] to Onondaga County. The state designation comes to an end at Route 5 in the hamlet of Bennetts Corners west of the village of [[Camillus (village), New York|Camillus]] shortly after; however, CR 66 continues onward.<ref name="google"/>

County Route 66 continues through farmlands of central [[New York]] and passes to the west of Camillus Country Club and its service road. It turns to the northeast as it continues towards [[Memphis, New York|Memphis]]. CR 66 intersects with local roads in the hamlet of Oswego Bitter before terminating at CR 67 and CR 134 in the hamlet of [[Memphis, New York|Memphis]].<ref name="google"/>

When [[state highway]]s in [[New York]] were first signed in 1924, what is now NY 321 south of Forward Road, as well as Forward Road itself, was designated as part of [[New York State Route 26 (1924)|NY 26]], a north-south highway connecting [[Ithaca, New York|Ithaca]] to [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]].<ref>{{cite news|title=New York's Main Highways Designated by Numbers|work=[[New York Times]]|date=[[1924-12-21]]|page=XX9}}</ref> In the [[1930 renumbering (New York)|1930 renumbering]], the segment of NY 26 between [[U.S. Route 20 (New York)|U.S. Route 20]] in [[Skaneateles (village), New York|Skaneateles]] and modern [[New York State Route 174|NY 174]] south of [[Camillus (village), New York|Camillus]] was renumbered to NY 321.<ref name="1930gb">''Automobile Legal Association (ALA) Automobile Green Book'', 1930/31 and 1931/32 editions, (Scarborough Motor Guide Co., Boston, 1930 and 1931).
