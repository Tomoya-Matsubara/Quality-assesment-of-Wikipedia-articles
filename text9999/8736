'''Vitamin C''' or '''<small>L</small>-ascorbate''' is an [[essential nutrient]] for [[simian|higher primates]], and a small number of other species. The presence of ascorbate is required for a range of essential [[metabolism|metabolic reactions]] in all animals and in plants and is [[biosynthesis|made internally]] by almost all organisms, (humans being one notable exception). It is widely known as the [[vitamin]] that prevents [[scurvy]] in humans.<ref name="UKFSA">{{cite web |url=http://www.eatwell.gov.uk/healthydiet/nutritionessentials/vitaminsandminerals/vitaminc/ |title=Vitamin C |accessdate=2007-02-19 |publisher=Food Standards Agency (UK) }}</ref><ref name="UMM">{{cite web |url=http://www.umm.edu/altmed/ConsSupplements/VitaminCAscorbicAcidcs.html |title=Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid) |accessdate=2007-02-19 |date=April 2002 |author= |publisher=University of Maryland Medical Center }}</ref><ref name="OSU">{{cite web |url=http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/vitamins/vitaminC/|title=Vitamin C |accessdate=2007-03-07 |date=2006-01-31 |first=Jane, Ph.D. |last= Higdon|publisher=Oregon State University, Micronutrient Information Center}}</ref> 

The [[pharmacophore]] of vitamin C is the ascorbate [[ion]]. In living organisms, ascorbate is an [[antioxidant]], as it protects the body against [[oxidative stress]],<ref name="Padayatty">{{cite journal |author=Padayatty S, Katz A, Wang Y, Eck P, Kwon O, Lee J, Chen S, Corpe C, Dutta A, Dutta S, Levine M |title=Vitamin C as an antioxidant: evaluation of its role in disease prevention |url=http://www.jacn.org/cgi/reprint/22/1/18.pdf |journal=J Am Coll Nutr |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=18-35 |year=2003 |pmid=12569111}}</ref> and is a [[cofactor]] in several vital [[enzyme|enzymatic]] reactions.<ref name="UKFSA Risk" />

As a nutrient, its uses and the daily requirement are matters of on-going debate. As a [[food additive]], vitamin C is used as an [[antioxidant]] [[preservative]] and an [[acidity regulator]]. Several [[E number]]s account for the vitamin, depending on its chemical structure: '''E300''' as [[ascorbic acid]], '''E301''' as the salt [[sodium ascorbate]], '''E302''' as the salt [[calcium ascorbate]], '''E303''' as the salt [[potassium ascorbate]], '''E304''' for the esters [[ascorbyl palmitate]] and [[ascorbyl stearate]], and '''E315''' for the stereoisomer [[erythorbic acid]].

When <small>L</small>-ascorbate, which is a strong [[reducing agent]] carries out its [[Redox|reducing]] function, it is converted to its [[Redox|oxidized]] form, [[Dehydroascorbic acid|<small>L</small>-dehydroascorbate]].<ref name="UKFSA Risk">{{cite web |url=http://www.food.gov.uk/multimedia/pdfs/evm_c.pdf |title=Vitamin C <U+2013> Risk Assessment |accessdate=2007-02-19 |publisher=UK Food Standards Agency }}</ref> <small>L</small>-dehydroscorbate can then be reduced back to the active <small>L</small>-ascorbate form in the body by [[enzyme]]s and [[glutathione]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Meister A |title=Glutathione-ascorbic acid antioxidant system in animals |url=http://www.jbc.org/cgi/reprint/269/13/9397.pdf |journal=J Biol Chem |volume=269 |issue=13 |pages=9397-400 |year=1994 |pmid=8144521}}</ref>

=== Function ===
In humans, vitamin C is a highly effective [[antioxidant]], acting to lessen [[oxidative stress]], a substrate for [[ascorbate peroxidase]],<ref name="OSU" /> as well as an enzyme [[cofactor]] for the [[biosynthesis]] of many important biochemicals. Vitamin C acts as an [[electron donor]] for eight different [[enzyme]]s:<ref>Levine M, Rumsey SC, Wang Y, Park JB, Daruwala R. Vitamin C.

[[Biological tissue]]s that accumulate over 100 times the level in blood plasma of vitamin C are the [[adrenal gland]]s, [[pituitary]], [[thymus]], [[corpus luteum]], and [[retina]].<ref>[http://www.nature.com/nm/journal/v8/n5/full/nm0502-445.html New view at C] Matthias A.

Those with 10 to 50 times the concentration present in blood plasma include the [[brain]], [[spleen]], [[lung]], [[testicle]], [[lymph nodes]], [[liver]], [[thyroid]], [[small intestine|small intestinal]] [[mucous membrane|mucosa]], [[leukocytes]], [[pancreas]], [[kidney]] and [[salivary glands]].

=== Biosynthesis ===
[[Image:Ascorbic-acid-3D-vdW.png|thumb|200px|left|Model of a vitamin C [[molecule]]. Black is [[carbon]], red is [[oxygen]], and white is [[hydrogen]]]]
The vast majority of animals and plants are able to synthesize their own vitamin C, through a sequence of four [[enzyme]]-driven steps, which convert [[glucose]] to vitamin C.<ref name="UKFSA Risk" /> The glucose needed to produce ascorbate in the liver (in [[mammals]] and [[perching birds]]) is extracted from glycogen; ascorbate synthesis is a glycogenolysis-dependent process.<ref>{{cite journal |author=B<U+00E1>nhegyi G, M<U+00E1>ndl J |title=The hepatic glycogenoreticular system |journal=Pathol Oncol Res |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=107-10 |year=2001 |pmid=11458272}}</ref> In [[reptiles]] and [[birds]] the biosynthesis is carried out in the [[kidney]]s.

Among the animals that have lost the ability to synthesise vitamin C are [[simian]]s, [[guinea pig]]s, the [[red-vented bulbul]],and [[Megabat|fruit-eating bats]].<ref name=" UKFSA Risk"/> Most notably, along with the rest of the ape family in which we reside, humans have no capability to manufacture vitamin C. The cause of this phenomenon is that the last enzyme in the synthesis process, [[L-gulonolactone oxidase|<small>L</small>-gulonolactone oxidase]], cannot be made by the listed animals because the gene for this enzyme, [[Pseudogene]] <U+03A8>GULO, is defective.<ref>{{cite book | title = Ascorbic Acid: Subcellular Biochemistry | author = Harris, J. Robin | publisher = Springer | isbn = 0306451484 | year = 1996 | pages = p. 35}}</ref> The [[mutation]] has not been lethal because vitamin C is prevalent in their food sources, with many of these species' natural diets consisting largely of fruit.

Most [[simian]]s consume the vitamin in amounts 10 to 20 times higher than that recommended by governments for humans.<ref>Milton, K. (1999) "Nutritional characteristics of wild primate foods: do the diets of our closest living relatives have lessons for us?" Nutrition. 1999 Jun;15(6):488-98.</ref>
It has been noted that the loss of the ability to synthesize ascorbate strikingly parallels the evolutionary loss of the ability to break down [[uric acid]]. Uric acid and ascorbate are both strong [[reducing agent]]s.  This has led to the suggestion that in higher primates, uric acid has taken over some of the functions of ascorbate.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Proctor P |title=Similar functions of uric acid and ascorbate in man? |journal=Nature |volume=228 |issue=5274 |pages=868 |year=1970 |pmid=5477017|doi=10.1038/228868a0}}</ref> Ascorbic acid can be [[oxidised]] (broken down) in the human body by the enzyme [[ascorbic acid oxidase]].

An adult [[goat]], a typical example of a vitamin C-producing animal, will manufacture more than 13,000 mg of vitamin C per day in normal health and as much as 100,000 mg daily when faced with life-threatening disease, trauma or stress.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.seanet.com/~alexs/ascorbate/197x/stone-i-orthomol_psych-1979-v8-n2-p58.htm |title=Eight Decades of Scurvy.

=== Deficiency ===
[[Scurvy]] is an [[avitaminosis]] resulting from lack of vitamin C, as without this vitamin, the synthesised [[collagen]] is too unstable to meet its function. Scurvy leads to the formation of liver spots on the skin, spongy gums, and bleeding from  all [[mucous membrane]]s.  The spots are most abundant on the thighs and legs, and a person with the ailment looks pale, feels depressed, and is partially immobilized. In advanced scurvy there are open, [[suppuration|suppurating wounds]] and loss of [[teeth]] and, eventually, death. The human body cannot store vitamin C,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002404.htm |title=Vitamin C |accessdate=2007-03-09 |date=[[2007-01-02]] |first=William |last =McGee |publisher=National Institutes of Health }}</ref> and so the body soon depletes itself if fresh supplies are not consumed through the digestive system.

== History of human understanding ==
[[Image:James lind.jpg|right|thumb|[[James Lind]], a British Royal Navy surgeon who, in 1747, identified that a quality in fruit prevented the disease of scurvy in what was the first [[scientific method|recorded controlled experiment]].]]

The need to include fresh plant food or raw animal flesh in the diet to prevent disease was known from ancient times. Native peoples living in marginal areas incorporated this into their medicinal lore. For example, spruce needles were used in temperate zones in infusions, or the leaves from species of drought-resistant trees in desert areas. In 1536, the French explorer [[Jacques Cartier]], exploring the [[Saint Lawrence River|St. Lawrence River]], used the local natives' knowledge to save his men who were dying of scurvy. He boiled the needles of the [[Thuja|arbor vitae]] tree to make a tea that was later shown to contain 50 mg of vitamin C per 100 grams.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www3.sympatico.ca/goweezer/canada/z00cartier3.htm |title=Jacques Cartier's Second Voyage - 1535 - Winter & Scurvy |accessdate=2007-02-25 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |pmid=12422875 |title=Jacques Cartier witnesses a treatment for scurvy |date=June 2002 |author=Martini E. |journal=Vesalius}}</ref>

Throughout history, the benefit of plant food to survive long sea voyages has been occasionally recommended by authorities. [[John Woodall]], the first appointed surgeon to the [[British East India Company]], recommended the preventive and curative use of [[lemon]] juice in his book "The Surgeon's Mate", in 1617. The [[Netherlands|Dutch]] writer, [[Johann Bachstrom]], in 1734, gave the firm opinion that ''"scurvy is solely owing to a total abstinence from fresh vegetable food, and greens; which is alone the primary cause of the disease."''

While the earliest documented case of scurvy was described by [[Hippocrates]] around the year 400 BC, the first attempt to give scientific basis for the cause of this disease was by a ship's surgeon in the British [[Royal Navy]], [[James Lind]]. Scurvy was common among those with poor access to fresh fruit and vegetables, such as remote, isolated [[sailor]]s and [[soldier]]s. While at sea in May 1747, Lind provided some crew members with two oranges and one lemon per day, in addition to normal rations, while others continued on [[cider]], [[vinegar]], [[sulfuric acid]] or [[seawater]], along with their normal rations. In the [[history of science]] this is considered to be the first occurrence of a controlled experiment comparing results on two populations of a factor applied to one group only with all other factors the same. The results conclusively showed that citrus fruits prevented the disease. Lind published his work in 1753 in his ''[[Treatise on the Scurvy]]''.

[[Image:Ambersweet oranges.jpg|left|thumb|[[Citrus|Citrus fruits]] were one of the first sources of vitamin C available to ship's surgeons.]]
Lind's work was slow to be noticed, partly because he gave conflicting evidence within the book, and partly because the British admiralty saw care for the well-being of crews as a sign of weakness. In addition, fresh fruit was very expensive to keep on board, whereas boiling it down to juice allowed easy storage but destroyed the vitamin (especially if boiled in copper kettles<ref name=oxford/>). Ship captains assumed wrongly that Lind's suggestions didn't work because those juices failed to cure scurvy.

It was 1795 before the British navy adopted lemons or [[Lime (fruit)|lime]] as standard issue at sea. Limes were more popular as they could be found in British West Indian Colonies, unlike lemons which weren't found in [[Dominion|British Dominions]], and were therefore more expensive. This practice led to the use of the nickname [[Alternative words for British|"limey"]] to refer to the British. [[James Cook|Captain James Cook]] had previously demonstrated and proven the principle of the advantages of fresh and preserved foods, such as [[sauerkraut]], by taking his crews to the [[Hawaiian Islands]] and beyond without losing any of his men to scurvy. For this otherwise unheard of feat, the British Admiralty awarded him a medal.

The name "antiscorbutic" was used in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries as general term for those foods known to prevent scurvy, even though there was no understanding of the reason for this. These foods included but were not limited to: lemons, limes, and oranges; sauerkraut, cabbage, malt, and [[portable soup]].

In 1907, [[Axel Holst]] and [[Theodor Fr<U+00F8>lich]], two [[Norway|Norwegian]] physicians studying [[beriberi]] contracted aboard ship's crews in the Norwegian Fishing Fleet, wanted a small test mammal to substitute for the [[pigeon]]s they used. They fed [[guinea pig]]s their test diet, which had earlier produced beriberi in their pigeons, and were surprised when scurvy resulted instead. Until that time scurvy had not been observed in any organism apart from humans, and had been considered an exclusively human disease.

=== Discovery of ascorbic acid ===
[[Image:GyorgyiNIH.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Albert Szent-Gy<U+00F6>rgyi, pictured here in 1948, was awarded the 1937 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Nobel Prize in Medicine]] for the discovery of vitamin C]]

In 1912, the [[Polish-American]] biochemist [[Casimir Funk]], while researching deficiency diseases, developed the concept of vitamins to refer to the nutrients which are essential to health. Then, from 1928 to 1933, the [[Hungary|Hungarian]] research team of [[Joseph L Svirbely]] and [[Albert Szent-Gy<U+00F6>rgyi]] and, independently, the [[United States|American]] [[Charles Glen King]], first isolated vitamin C and showed it to be ascorbic acid. For this, Szent-Gy<U+00F6>rgyi was awarded the 1937 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Nobel Prize in Medicine]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pitt.edu/history/1932.html |title=Pitt History - 1932: Charles Glen King |accessdate=2007-02-21 |quote=In recognition of this medical breakthrough, some scientists believe that King deserved a Nobel Prize. |publisher=[[University of Pittsburgh]] }}</ref>

In 1928 the Arctic anthropologist [[Vilhjalmur Stefansson]] attempted to prove his theory of how the [[Eskimo]]s are able to avoid scurvy with almost no plant food in their diet, despite the disease striking European Arctic explorers living on similar high-meat diets. Stefansson theorised that the natives get their vitamin C from fresh meat that is minimally cooked.  Starting in February 1928, for one year he and a colleague lived on an exclusively minimally-cooked meat diet while under medical supervision; they remained healthy.

Between 1933 and 1934, the British chemists Sir [[Walter Norman Haworth]] and Sir [[Edmund Hirst]] and, independently, the Polish chemist [[Tadeus Reichstein]], succeeded in synthesizing the vitamin, the first to be artificially produced. This made possible the cheap mass-production of vitamin C. Only Haworth was awarded the 1937 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] for this work, but the process for vitamin C retained Reichstein's name.

In 1934 [[Hoffmann<U+2013>La Roche]] became the first pharmaceutical company to mass-produce synthetic vitamin C, under the brand name of [[Redoxon]].

In 1959 the American [[J.J. Burns]] showed that the reason some mammals were susceptible to scurvy was the inability of their [[liver]] to produce the active [[enzyme]] [[L-gulonolactone oxidase|<small>L</small>-gulonolactone oxidase]], which is the last of the chain of four enzymes which synthesize vitamin C.<ref>Burns, J. J., and Evans, C., J. Biol. Chem., 200, 125 (1953).</ref><ref>Burns, J. J., Peyser, P., and Maltz, A., Science, 124, 1148 (1956).</ref> American biochemist [[Irwin Stone]] was the first to exploit vitamin C for its food preservative properties.

=== Government recommended intakes ===
Recommendations for vitamin C intake have been set by various national agencies:
*40 milligrams per day <U+2014> the United Kingdom's [[Food Standards Agency]]<ref name=" UKFSA" />
*45 milligrams per day <U+2014> the [[World Health Organization]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2004/9241546123_chap7.pdf |title=Vitamin and mineral requirements in human nutrition, 2nd edition |accessdate=2007-02-20 |date=2004 |publisher=World Health Organization }}</ref>

== Vitamin C as a macronutrient ==
{{main|Vitamin C megadosage|Megavitamin therapy|Orthomolecular medicine}}
There is a strong advocacy movement for large doses of vitamin C, promoting a great deal of added benefits. Many pro-vitamin C organizations promote usage levels well beyond the current [[Dietary Reference Intake]]. The movement is led by scientists and doctors such as [[Robert Cathcart]], [[Ewan Cameron (Vitamin C)|Ewan Cameron]], [[Steve Hickey]],  [[Irwin Stone]] and the twice [[Nobel Prize]] laureate [[Linus Pauling]] and the more controversial [[Matthias Rath]]. There is an extensive and growing scientific literature critical of governmental agency dose recommendations.<ref name="PR Newswire"/><ref>{{cite journal |author = Forman, Robert  |year=1981 |title=Medical Resistance To Innovation |journal=Medical Hypotheses |volume=7 |issue=8 |pages=1009-1017 |url=http://www.seanet.com/~alexs/ascorbate/198x/forman-r-med_hypotheses-1981-v7-n8-p1009.htm |accessdate=2007-02-23 }}</ref> The [[biological halflife]] for vitamin C is fairly short, about 30 minutes in blood plasma, a fact which high dose advocates say that mainstream researchers have failed to take into account. Researchers at the [[National Institutes of Health]] decided upon the current RDA based upon tests conducted 12 hours (24 half lives) after consumption. Hickey, on this matter, says "To be blunt, the NIH gave a dose of vitamin C, waited until it had been excreted, and then measured blood levels."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newmediaexplorer.org/chris/2004/07/09/the_vitamin_c_fanatics_were_right_all_along.htm |title=The Vitamin C Fanatics Were Right All Along |accessdate=2007-02-22 |date=July 09, 2004 |last=Sardi |first= Bill |publisher=Knowledge of Health, Inc. }}</ref>

=== Evolutionary rationales ===
Humans carry a [[genetic mutation|mutated and ineffective]] form of the [[gene]] required by all mammals for manufacturing the fourth of the four [[enzymes]] that manufacture vitamin C.<ref>{{cite journal|author=|title=HYPOASCORBEMIA|accessdate=2007-03-06 |author=OMIM.

The gene, [[L-gulonolactone oxidase|Pseudogene <U+03A8>GULO]], lost its function millions of years ago, when the anthropoids branched out.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hickey |first = Steve | coauthors = Roberts, Hilary | title = Ascorbate: The Science of Vitamin C |year=2004 |publisher=Lulu Press, Inc. |isbn=1-4116-0724-4 }}</ref> In humans the three functional enzymes continue to produce the precursors to vitamin C, but the process is incomplete; these enzymes ultimately undergo proteolytic degradation.

[[Image:Endo dysfunction Athero.PNG|220px|right|thumb|[[Atherosclerosis]] has been hypothesised to be a vitamin C deficiency disease]]
The [[Matthias Rath#Controversy|controversial]] [[Matthias Rath]] hypothesised that during the [[ice age]], when vitamin C was scarce, [[natural selection]] favoured human individuals who could repair arteries with a layer of [[cholesterol]]. He suggests that although eventually harmful, cholesterol lining of artery walls would be beneficial in that it would keep the individual alive until access to vitamin C allowed arterial damage to be repaired. If this is true, [[atherosclerosis]] is in fact a vitamin C deficiency disease. As atherosclerosis is the main cause of [[ischaemic heart disease]], which in turn is the leading cause of death in [[developed countries]],<ref>[http://ucatlas.ucsc.edu/cause.php WHO World Health Report 2002]</ref> this would have a profound effect on western medicine.

== Testing for ascorbate levels in the body ==
Simple tests use [[dichlorphenolindophenol|DCPIP]] to measure the levels of vitamin C in the [[urine]] and in [[serum]] or [[blood plasma]]. However these reflect recent dietary intake rather than the level of vitamin C in body stores.<ref name="UKFSA Risk" /> Reverse phase [[high performance liquid chromatography]] is used for determining the storage levels of vitamin C within [[lymphocyte]]s and [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]].

It has been observed that while serum or blood plasma levels follow the [[circadian rhythm]] or short term dietary changes, those within tissues themselves are more stable and give a better view of the availability of ascorbate within the organism. However, very few hospital laboratories are adequately equipped and trained to carry out such detailed analyses, and require samples to be analyzed in specialized laboratories.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Emadi-Konjin P, Verjee Z, Levin A, Adeli K | title = Measurement of intracellular vitamin C levels in human lymphocytes by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). | journal = Clinical Biochemistry | volume = 38 | issue = 5 | pages = 450-6 | year = 2005 | id = PMID 15820776}} <blockquote>"''Serum and plasma vitamin C measurements do not correlate well with tissue levels while lymphocyte vitamin C levels provide the most accurate assessment of the true status of vitamin C stores and are not affected acutely by [[circadian rhythm]] or dietary changes.''"</blockquote></ref><ref>{{cite journal | author= Yamada H, Yamada K, Waki M, Umegaki K. | title= Lymphocyte and Plasma Vitamin C Levels in Type 2 Diabetic Patients With and Without Diabetes Complications | journal= Diabetes Care | year=2004 | volume=27 | issue = | pages=2491<U+2013>2 | url= http://care.diabetesjournals.org/cgi/reprint/27/10/2491.pdf | format=PDF }} <blockquote>"''The plasma concentration of vitamin C is considered to be strongly correlated with transient consumption of foods.

In diabetes, therefore, the measurement of lymphocyte vitamin C might be expected to be a more reliable antioxidant biomarker than plasma vitamin C level.''"</blockquote></ref>

== Adverse effects ==
While being harmless in most typical quantities, as with all substances to which the human body is exposed, vitamin C can still cause harm under certain conditions.

=== Common side-effects ===
Relatively large doses of vitamin C may cause [[indigestion]], particularly when taken on an empty stomach. This unpleasant but harmless side-effect can be avoided by taking the vitamin along with meals or by offsetting its acidity by taking an antacid such as [[Sodium bicarbonate|baking soda]] or [[calcium carbonate]].

When taken in huge doses, vitamin C causes [[diarrhea]]. The minimum dose that brings about this effect varies with the individual. [[Robert Cathcart]] has called this limit the "[[bowel tolerance]] threshold" and observed that it is higher in people with serious illness than those in good health.<ref name="Cathcart"/> It ranges from 5 to 25 grams per day in healthy individuals to 300 grams per day in those that are severely ill. Diarrhea is not harmful, as long as the dose is reduced quickly.

In one trial, doses up to 6 grams of ascorbic acid were given to 29 infants, 93 children of preschool and school age, and 20 adults for more than 1400 days. With the higher doses, toxic manifestations were observed in five adults and four infants. The signs and symptoms in adults were nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, flushing of the face, headache, fatigue and disturbed sleep. The main toxic reactions in the infants were skin rashes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.inchem.org/documents/jecfa/jecmono/v05je20.htm |title=Toxicological evaluation of some food additives including anticaking agents, antimicrobials, antioxidants, emulsifiers and thickening agents |accessdate=2007-04-13 |date=4 July 1973 |author= |publisher=World Health Organization }}</ref>

=== Rare side-effects ===
As vitamin C enhances iron absorption, [[iron poisoning]] can become an issue to people with rare [[iron overload disorder]]s, such as [[haemochromatosis]]. A genetic condition that results in inadequate levels of the enzyme [[glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase]] (G6PD), can cause sufferers to develop [[hemolytic anemia]] after ingesting specific oxidizing substances, such as very large dosages of vitamin C. However, there is a test available for [[Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency|G6PD deficiency]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://brightspot.org/cresearch/intravenousc2.shtml |title=Intravenous Ascorbate as a Chemotherapeutic and Biologic Response Modifying Agent |accessdate=2007-02-19 |publisher=The Center For The Improvement Of Human Functioning International }}</ref> and it has been proposed that high doses of [[vitamin E]] may protect against this problem.

In addition, large doses of vitamin C (2 g per day) trigger [[oxalate]] formation and increase absorption of dietary oxalate, possibly causing kidney stones[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&cmd=Retrieve&dopt=AbstractPlus&list_uids=15987848&query_hl=1&itool=pubmed_docsum].

=== Chance of overdose ===
As discussed previously, vitamin C exhibits remarkably low toxicity. The [[LD50|LD<sub>50</sub>]] (the dose that will kill 50% of a population) in rats is generally accepted to be 11900 milligrams per kilogram when taken orally.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://physchem.ox.ac.uk/MSDS/AS/ascorbic_acid.html |title=Safety (MSDS) data for ascorbic acid |accessdate= 2007-02-21 |date= [[2005-10-09]] | publisher= [[Oxford University]] }}</ref> The LD<sub>50</sub> in humans remains unknown, owing to [[medical ethics]] that preclude experiments which would put patients at risk of harm. However , as with all substances tested in this way, the LD<sub>50</sub> is taken as a guide to its toxicity in humans and no data to contradict this has been found.

== Natural and artificial dietary sources ==
[[Image:Rosa canina hips.jpg|right|thumb|[[Rose hips]] are a particularly rich source of vitamin C]]
The richest natural sources are fruits and vegetables, and of those, the [[camu camu]] fruit and the [[Kakadu plum]] contain the highest concentration of the vitamin.  It is also present in some cuts of meat, especially liver.  Vitamin C is the most widely taken [[nutritional supplement]] and is available in a variety of forms, including tablets, drink mixes, crystals in capsules or naked crystals.

=== Plant sources ===
While plants are generally a good source of vitamin C, the amount in foods of plant origin depends on: the precise variety of the plant, the soil condition, the climate in which it grew, the length of time since it was picked, the storage conditions, and the method of preparation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uk.foedevarestyrelsen.dk/Nutrition/Vitamin_mineral_content_is_stable/forside.htm |title=The vitamin and mineral content is stable |accessdate=2007-03-07 |publisher=Danish Veterinary and Food Administration }}</ref>

=== Animal sources ===
[[Image:Goat.jpg|thumb|300px|Goats, like almost all animals, make their own vitamin C. An adult goat will manufacture more than 13,000 mg of vitamin C per day in normal health and as much as 100,000 mg daily when faced with life-threatening disease, trauma or stress.]]

The overwhelming majority of species of animals and plants synthesise their own vitamin C, making some, but not all, animal products, sources of dietary vitamin C.

Vitamin C is most present in the liver and least present in the muscle. Since muscle provides the majority of meat consumed in the western human diet, animal products are not a reliable source of the vitamin. Vitamin C is present in [[Breastfeeding#Benefits|mother's milk]] and, in lower amounts, in [[Milk#Nutritional benefits|raw cow's milk]], with [[pasteurized milk]] containing only trace amounts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.saanendoah.com/compare.html |title= Comparing Milk: Human, Cow, Goat & Commercial Infant Formula |accessdate=2007-02-28 |date=8 January 2007 |first=Stephanie, Ph.D | last= Clark |publisher=[[Washington State University]] }}</ref> All excess Vitamin C is disposed of through the urinary system.

The following table shows the relative abundance of vitamin C in various foods of animal origin, given in milligram of vitamin C per 100 grams of food:

=== Food preparation ===
Vitamin C [[chemical decomposition|chemically decomposes]] under certain conditions, many of which may occur during the cooking of food. Normally, boiling water at 100<U+00B0>C is not hot enough to cause any significant destruction of the nutrient, which only decomposes at 190<U+00B0>C, despite popular opinion. However, [[pressure cooking]], roasting, frying and [[grilling]] food is more likely to reach the [[decomposition temperature]] of vitamin C. Longer cooking times also add to this effect, as will copper food vessels, which [[catalyse]] the decomposition.<ref name=oxford/>

Another cause of vitamin C being lost from food is [[leaching]], where the water-soluble vitamin dissolves into the cooking water, which is later poured away and not consumed. However, vitamin C doesn't leach in all vegetables at the same rate; research shows [[broccoli]] seems to retain more than any other.<ref name=Combs>Combs GF. The Vitamins, Fundamental Aspects in Nutrition and Health. 2nd ed. San Diego, CA: Academic Press, 2001:245<U+2013>272</ref> Research has also shown that fresh-cut fruit don't lose significant nutrients when stored in the refrigerator for a few days.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.webmd.com/content/article/123/115022.htm |title=Fresh-Cut Fruit May Keep Its Vitamins |accessdate=2007-02-25 |date=2 June 2006 |first=Miranda |last=Hitti |publisher=WebMD }}</ref>

=== Vitamin C supplements ===
[[Image:RedoxonVitaminC.jpg|thumb|right|Vitamin C is widely available in the form of tablets and powders. The [[Redoxon]] brand, launched in 1934 by [[Hoffmann-La Roche]], was the first mass-produce synthetic vitamin C.]]
Vitamin C is the most widely taken dietary supplement.<ref> [http://www.thedietchannel.com/Vitamin-C.htm The Diet Channel] Vitamin C might be the most widely known and most popular vitamin purchased as a supplement. </ref> It is available in many forms including caplets, tablets, capsules, drink mix packets, in multi-vitamin formulations, in multiple antioxidant formulations, as chemically pure crystalline powder, timed release versions, and also including [[bioflavonoids]] such as quercetin, hesperidin and rutin. The use of vitamin C supplements with added bioflavonoids and, often, flavours and sweeteners, can be problematic at gram dosages, since those additives are not so well studied as vitamin C. Also, the presence of glucose in the intestines or bloodstream inhibits the absorption of vitamin C.  Tablet and capsule sizes range from 25 mg to 1500 mg. Vitamin C (as ascorbic acid) crystals are typically available in bottles containing 300 g to 1 kg of powder (a teaspoon of vitamin C crystals equals 5,000 mg). In supplements, vitamin C most often comes in the form of various [[mineral ascorbates]], as they are easier to absorb, more easily tolerated and provide a source of several [[dietary mineral]]s.

===Absorption of Vitamin C===
Vitamin C is absorbed by the intestines using a sodium-ion dependent channel. It is transported through the intestine via both glucose-sensitive and glucose-insensitive mechanisms. Having a lot of sugar either in your intestines or in your blood (as in [[diabetes mellitus]]) can slow absorption, which is relevant when megadosing.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wilson JX |title=Regulation of vitamin C transport |journal=Annu. Rev. Nutr. |volume=25 |issue= |pages=105-25 |year=2005 |pmid=16011461 |doi=10.1146/annurev.nutr.25.050304.092647}}</ref>

=== Artificial modes of synthesis ===
Vitamin C is produced from [[glucose]] by two main routes. The [[Tadeusz Reichstein|Reichstein process]], developed in the 1930s, uses a single pre-fermentation followed by a purely chemical route. The modern two-step [[Fermentation|fermentation process]], originally developed in [[China]] in the 1960s, uses additional fermentation to replace part of the later chemical stages. Both processes yield approximately 60% vitamin C from the glucose feed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.competition-commission.org.uk/rep_pub/reports/2001/fulltext/456a4.2.pdf |title=The production of vitamin C |accessdate=2007-02-20 |date=2001 |publisher=Competition Commission }}</ref>

Research is underway at the [[Scottish Crop Research Institute]] in the interest of creating a strain of yeast that can synthesise vitamin C in a single fermentation step from [[galactose]], a technology expected to reduce manufacturing costs considerably.<ref name="yeastAA" />

World production of synthesised vitamin C is currently estimated at approximately 110,000 tonnes annually.
Main producers today are [[BASF]]/[[Takeda Chemical Industries|Takeda]], [[DSM (company)|DSM]], [[Merck KGaA|Merck]] and the China Pharmaceutical Group Ltd. of the [[People's Republic of China]]. China is slowly becoming the major world supplier as its prices undercut those of the US and European manufacturers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nutraingredients.com/news/ng.asp?n=63349-dsm-vitamin-c |title=DSM makes last stand against Chinese vitamin C |accessdate=2007-02-20 |date=[[2005-10-20]] |first=Dominique |last=Patton |publisher=nutraingredients }}</ref>
