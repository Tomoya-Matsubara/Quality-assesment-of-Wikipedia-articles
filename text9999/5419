'''Skiing in Australia''' began at the [[goldrush]] town of [[Kiandra]], NSW around 1861, and Australia today has extensive skiable terrain  in the South Eastern states between elevations of around 1250m to 2200m, with several well developed ski resorts, including [[Thredbo]], [[Perisher Blue, New South Wales|Perisher]] and [[Mount Buller]].<ref>Footnote: Elevation of snowfields varies with latitude. Thredbo has Australia's highest lifted point at 2037m and its base elevation is 1365m. [[Kiandra]], New South Wales, where skiing began in Australia, has an elevation of 1400m. [[Mount Mawson]] ski rope tows, which are an hour and a half from Hobart, in Tasmania, are at 1250m elevation, according to the Southern Tasmanian Ski Association.</ref><ref>{{Citation

[[Jindabyne]] is the main service town for the New South Wales resorts, but most Australian resort centres have on-snow accommodation. Other ski-service towns include [[Cooma]] and [[Adaminaby]] in NSW and [[Bright]] in Victoria. [[Canberra]] is situated around two hours from the New South Wales ski-fields, while [[Melbourne]] is in good proximity to some of the Victorian resorts (less than three hours to [[Mount Buller]] and just 120&nbsp;km from [[Mount Baw Baw]]).

Australia's highest town, [[Cabramurra]], [[New South Wales]], has private skiing facilities for residents and the resort village of [[Dinner Plain]] in Victoria also has ski facilities.

The mainland's highest peak is [[Mount Kosciuszko]] at 2228m<ref>Footnote: As regards regions with skiable terrain, the Australian Government's Geoscience Australia Website records the highest mountains by State and Territory as follows: [[Mount Kosciuszko]], NSW, 2228; [[Mount Bogong]], VIC, 1986m; [[Bimberi Peak]], ACT, 1912m; [[Mount Ossa]], TAS, 1617m (while the highest mountain on Australian Territory is actually [[Mawson Peak]], [[Heard Island]], at 2745m, which despite being snowbound, has no ski industry owing to its extreme isolation).</ref>.

===New South Wales===

[[New South Wales]] is home to Australia's highest snow country, oldest skifields and largest resorts. Recreational skiing in Australia began around 1861 at [[Kiandra]], New South Wales, when [[Norwegian people|Norwegian]] gold miners introduced the idea to the frozen hills around the town.<ref>{{Citation

====Kiandra and the Northern Skifields====
[[Image:Kiandra carnival 1900 Charles Kerry.jpeg|thumb|left|[[Kiandra]], NSW, where skiing began in Australia in 1861]]
[[File:Her Majesty's Mail arriving at Kiandra.jpg|thumb|The mailman arrives at Kiandra.]]

The [[Kiandra snow shoe club]] (now called the ''Kiandra Pioneer Ski Club (1861)'') remains the world's first identifiable and ceaseless Ski Club. This Australian club has been continuously operating since 1861. It<U+2019>s origins have been recognised internationally and substantiated by the [[Holmenkollen Ski Museum]], Norway in 2006. <ref> http://members.ozemail.com.au/~sealark/skiing_history.html </ref> The discovery of gold in the mountains of America and Australia was the catalyst  for the development of recreational alpine skiing. <ref> http://members.ozemail.com.au/~sealark/skiing_history.html  </ref> 
 
It has been claimed that an unidentifiable ski club (unnamed and without membership names) commenced in America in 1861.  <ref> Butte Record, Marysville, "Daily Appeal" 26th January 1861.  </ref> The "Trysil Skytte- og Skil<U+00F8>berforening" (Shot and Ski Practitioner Association) was also founded in Trysil, Hedmark, Norway, in 1861. The association held their first competition in January 1862 <ref>1861 Trysil newspaper report. Link Label </ref> [[Alpine skiing]], as a sport, commenced over twenty five years before any ski club can be identified as being formed in Europe.  Alpine ski clubs were first founded in Munich, Germany 1891, Switzerland 1893, Arlberg, Austria 1901, followed by France and Italy. Sir Arnold Lunn founded the Kandahar Ski Club of Great Britain in 1924.

The <U+201C>Kiandra Snow Shoe Club<U+201D> held separate ski races for both ladies and children as early as 1885. Barbara Yan was the first identifiable woman documented as to having won a  Downhill Skiing Championship. Barbara also won the ladies downhill in 1887, the year her siblings won the girls under 8 section and second in the under 12's. <ref>  Manaro Mercury,  Cooma & Bombala Advertiser -10th August,1887. </ref> In 1908 the club held the first ever documented International and Intercontinental Downhill Skiing Carnival. Results- America 1st, Australia 2nd, England 3rd. <ref> The Melbourne Argus, 6th July, 1908. </ref> 

Australia's Longest Running Skiing Competition is The Balmain Cup. By 1933 team racing was open to virtually all competitors from any club or imported talents but Arthur Balmain of [[Cooma]] believed this was unfair to local enthusiasts. He donated a perpetual trophy open only to competitors residing in or about the Southern Districts and only for members who held membership for twelve weeks in the local ski-Club. Arthur Balmain, whose company transported skiers to all localities, envisaged a competition that would encompass all Clubs. He decreed that a team must compete for the Balmain Cup with all members competing in four disciplines, Downhill, Slalom, Jump and Langlauf. In 1946 the competition format for competitors eligibility was changed and the jump section was removed.  History of the event. <ref> http://members.ozemail.com.au/~sealark/Balmain_Cup.html </ref>

In the wilderness region south of Kiandra, The Alpine Hut, near [[Mount Jagungal]] was built in 1939 to cater for skiers. Access was arduous - via packhorse and ski.<ref>http://www.australianalpineclub.com/pages/H_prt2/heritage_2_01.html</ref>

The Kiandra Goldrush was short-lived, but the township remained a service centre for recreational and survival skiing for over a century. Australia's first [[T-Bar]], was installed at Kiandra in 1957, but the ski facilities were finally shifted up the hill to [[Selwyn Snowfields]] in 1978<ref>http://selwynsnow.com.au/templates/sel/page/page_html_standard.php?secID=69</ref>. Steeper slopes and more reliable snows lie further to the south and in the 20th Century, the focus of recreational skiing in New South Wales shifted southward, to the [[Mount Kosciuszko]] region<ref>The history of skiing at Kiandra has been the subject of several studies,  including 1959's "Historic Kiandra", written by the Kiandra Historical Society and ''Kiandra Goldfields to Skifields'' (2006) by Norman W. Clarke</ref>.

====The Kosciusko Region====
[[File:Charlotte Pass 2008.jpg|thumb|[[Charlotte Pass]], a pioneer of the Australian ski industry. Village Elevation at 1760m.]]

In 1900, a hut was built at [[Bett's Camp]], above the Thredbo Escarpment and came into use for winter skiers. The Hotel Kosciusko was opened by the New South Wales Government in 1909 at what is now Sponars Chalet, near Smiggin Holes.<ref>http://www.kac.org.au/history.html</ref>

The first Kosciuszko Chalet was built at [[Charlotte Pass]] in 1930, giving relatively comfortable access to Australia's highest terrain.<ref>http://www.charlottepass.com.au/chalet.html</ref> In 1964, Australia briefly boasted the "World's Longest [[Chairlift]]", designed to carry skiers from the Thredbo Valley to Charlotte Pass, but technical difficulties soon closed the facility<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/travel/of-ice-and-men-20090121-7mbh.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Of ice and men | date=2009-01-24}}</ref><ref>http://www.colongwilderness.org.au/RedIndex/NSW/Jagu99.htm</ref>. At 1760m, Charlotte Pass has the highest village base elevation of any Australia ski resort and can only be accessed via over-snow transport in winter<ref name="smh.com.au">{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/travel/50-reasons-to-love-australian-snow-20090603-bv3f.html?page=-1 | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=50 reasons to love Australian snow | first1=Robert | last1=Upe | first2=Jim | last2=Darby | first3=Russell | last3=Holt | first4=Susan | last4=Bredow | date=2009-06-06}}</ref>. The growing number of ski enthusiasts heading to Charlotte Pass led to the establishment of a cafe at [[Smiggin Holes]] around 1939, where horse drawn sleighs would deliver skiers to be begin the arduous ski to the Kosciusko Chalet<ref>http://www.perisherblue.com.au/summer/history/index.html</ref>. It was the construction of the vast [[Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Scheme]] from 1949 that really opened up the [[Snowy Mountains]] for large scale development of a ski industry and led to the establishment of [[Thredbo]] and Perisher as leading Australian resorts.<ref name="thredbo.com.au">http://www.thredbo.com.au/about-thredbo/history/</ref><ref name="perisherblue.com.au">http://www.perisherblue.com.au/winter/info/history.html</ref>.  The Construction of [[Guthega]] Dam brought skiers to the isolated Guthega district and a rope tow was installed there in 1957<ref>http://www.christianacapital.com/Text/1201316577093-6700/</ref>. 

Skifields up by Kosciusko's side were also established during this period, though their existence is now little realised. The Australian Alpine Club was founded in 1950 by [[Charles Anton]] with a view to establishing  a chain of lodges for ski touring across the Australian Alps. Huts were constructed in the "Back Country" close to Mount Kosciusko, including [[Kunama Hut]], which opened for the 1953 season. A rope tow was installed on [[Mount Northcote]] at the site and opened in 1954. The site proved excellent for speed skiing, but the hut was destroyed in an [[avalanche]], which also killed one person, in 1956<ref>[http://www.australianalpineclub.com/index.html History of the Australian Alpine Club]</ref>.

Anton also recognised the potential of the Thredbo Valley for construction of a major resort and village, with good vertical terrain. Construction began in 1957 <ref name="thredbo.com.au"/>. Today, Thredbo has 14 ski-lifts and possesses Australia's longest ski resort run, the 5.9&nbsp;km from Karel's T-Bar to [[Friday Flat]]; Australia's greatest vertical drop of 672m; and  the highest lifted point in Australia at 2037m<ref>http://www.thredbo.com.au/about-thredbo/resort-information/facts-and-figures/winter-2009.asp</ref><ref>http://www.openroad.com.au/travel_holidayideas_snowbusiness.asp</ref> 

The last establishment of a major skifield in NSW came with the development of [[Blue Cow|Mount Blue Cow]] in the 1980s. In 1987 the Swiss designed [[Skitube Alpine Railway]] opened to deliver skiers from [[Bullocks Flat, New South Wales|Bullocks Flat]], on the [[Alpine Way]], to Perisher Valley and to Blue Cow, which also opened in 1987.<ref name="perisherblue.com.au"/> The operators of Blue Cow purchased Guthega in 1991, and the new combined resort later merged with Perisher-Smiggins to become the largest ski resort in the [[Southern Hemisphere]]<ref>http://www.perisher.com.au/winter/info/history.html</ref>. In 2009 Perisher had 48 lifts covering 1,245 hectares and four village base areas: Perisher Valley, Blue Cow, Smiggin Holes and Guthega.<ref>http://www.perisher.com.au/winter/info/stats.html</ref>

===Victoria===
[[File:MarysSlide.jpg|thumb| [[Mount Hotham]] Victoria]]
Victoria is the State with the greatest number of ski resorts in Australia. The highest peak in Victoria is [[Mount Bogong]] at 1986m.<ref name="ga.gov.au">http://www.ga.gov.au/education/geoscience-basics/landforms/highest-mountains.jsp</ref>

A hospice was built at Mount Saint Bernard (Elevation 1540) around 1863 along a track developed to link the Victorian gold fields. Snowshoes were developed locally to assist winter travellers and a larger hospice built around 1884. Recreational and practical skiing was being practised in the area by the 1880s and 90s with skis made from local timbers, and making use of single steering poles. The first winter traverse of the Victorian Alps was made in 1900, via the Hospice and Mount Hotham. The Hospice operated as a recreational ski location into the 1930s, but was destroyed by bushfire in 1939<ref>http://www.australianalpineclub.com/pages/H_prt4/H_prt04_03.htm Australian Alpine Club Heritage</ref>.

Skiing began at Mount Buffalo in the 1890s and the Mount Buffalo Chalet in Victoria was constructed in 1910. Australia's first ski tow was constructed near Mount Buffalo in 1936.<ref>http://www.australianalps.environment.gov.au/parks/mount-buffalo.html</ref> Buffalo's first ski lodge was built at Dingo Dell in 1954. A bushfire in 2006 forced the temporary closure of the resort and negotiations are continuing over a new lease on the property.<ref>http://www.mtbuffaloresort.com.au/environment_chalet_history_time.php</ref><ref>http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/lodge-destroyed-on-mount-buffalo/2006/12/12/1165685681152.html</ref>  A stone cottage was built at [[Mount Hotham]] in 1925 to cater for a growing interest in sport of skiing and a Club was built in 1944 with the first ski tow installed in 1951.<ref>http://www.mthotham.com.au/resort/about/history/</ref> A ski hut was erected at [[Mount Baw Baw]], just 120&nbsp;km East of Melbourne, in 1945 and a ski rope tow added in 1955.<ref>http://www.mountbawbaw.com.au/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=136&Itemid=221</ref> The first ski lift went into service at Mount Buller in 1949, and in the same year rope tow was installed at [[Falls Creek]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/travel/travel-factsheet/mount-buller--culture-and-history-20081126-6idd.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Mount Buller - Culture and History}}</ref> In 1957, Australia's first chairlift was installed at Falls Creek,<ref>http://www.fallscreek.com.au/HistoryoftheResort</ref> and the area is today the largest ski resort in Victoria.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

The Mount Buller Interschools Event claims to be the largest interdisciplinary snow-sports event on earth. In 2008 it attracted 3500 participants.<ref name="smh.com.au"/>

Snow play is also available at [[Mount Donna Buang]].

===Australian Capital Territory===
[[File:Road Closed Mount Franklin.jpg|thumb|The road to Mount Franklin, [[Australian Capital Territory|A.C.T.]], was built by the Canberra Alpine Club in the 1930s]]
The most northerly ski fields in Australia are located in the [[Australian Capital Territory|A.C.T.]] - in the [[Brindabella Ranges]] which rise to the west of [[Canberra]], the capital city of Australia, and include the [[Namadgi National Park]] in the A.C.T. and [[Bimberi Nature Reserve]] and [[Brindabella National Park]] in [[New South Wales]]. The highest mountain in the ACT is [[Bimberi Peak]], which lies above the treeline at 1912 metres, at the northern edge of the [[Snowy Mountains]].<ref name="ga.gov.au"/>

A ski chalet was constructed at [[Mount Franklin, Australian Capital Territory|Mount Franklin]] in 1938 to service the [[Canberra Alpine Club]]<ref>http://www.australianalps.environment.gov.au/parks/bimberi.html</ref>. Ski runs were cleared and ski tows were improvised<ref>http://www.cac.org.au/wotzon.htm#OpenDay</ref>. The chalet later operated as a museum before being destroyed in the [[2003 Canberra bushfires|2003 bushfires]]<ref>http://www.cac.org.au/history.htm</ref>. A new shelter designed and built by University of Adelaide students opened in 2008. Today, cross country skiing is possible in the area, when conditions allow.<ref>http://www.australianalps.environment.gov.au/parks/namadgi.html</ref> Cross Country skiing is also practised at [[Mount Gingera]], which rises above the city of Canberra to an elevation of 1855m, and is the most prominent snow covered peak above the city.<ref name="australia.com">http://www.australia.com/destinations/icons/namadgi.aspx</ref><ref name="ReferenceA">INSTRUMENT NO. 111 OF 1999 ACT Legislation</ref>

Snow play is available at [[Corin Forest]], near Canberra, at an elevation of 1200m. A development plan was drafted following the 2003 Canberra bushfires which would see three 600m chairlifts installed together with [[snowmaking]] facilities and accommodation at this site.<ref>http://www.corin.com.au/futurePlans.htm</ref>

===Tasmania===
[[File:Summit run.jpg|thumb|The Summit Run, [[Ben Lomond, Tasmania]]]]
The most southerly ski fields in Australia are located in [[Tasmania]], a mountainous island off the southern coast of Eastern Australia. Much of the State is subject to at least occasional winter snows. [[Mount Ossa]] is the highest point on the island at 1614m but Tasmania has eight [[Highest mountains of Tasmania|mountains]] exceeding 1500m and 28 above 1,220m. Also notable is the Central Plateau, at an elevation of around 900m. The capital city of [[Hobart]] is built at the base of [[Mount Wellington (Tasmania)|Mount Wellington]], which at 1270m is snow capped in winter.<ref name="abs.gov.au">http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/bb8db737e2af84b8ca2571780015701e/876720A0621CD8E5CA25710E00756155?opendocument#</ref> 

Tasmania's premier [[Alpine skiing]] operations are located at Ben Lomond, 60&nbsp;km from [[Launceston, Tasmania|Launceston]].<ref>http://www.ltvtasmania.com.au/content/view/14/74/</ref> The village is at 1460m and the top elevation is 1570m.<ref>http://www.skimountain.co.uk/resort-guide/ski-ben-lomond</ref> Limited downhill ski operations also exist in the [[Mount Field National Park]] at [[Mount Mawson]], which is approximately 89 kilometres north west of Hobart and rises from 1200m to 1320m altitude.<ref>http://stsa.webbed.com.au/</ref>

One of Australia's most scenic alpine locations is located in Tasmania at [[Cradle Mountain]], where cross country skiing is possible. Cradle Mountain is part of the Tasmanian Wilderness [[World Heritage]] Area, inscribed by [[UNESCO]] in 1982.<ref name="parks.tas.gov.au">http://www.parks.tas.gov.au/index.aspx?base=391</ref>

==Competitive Skiing==
[[File:The start of girls' snowshoe race, Kiandra.jpg|thumb|left|The Start of the Girls' Snowshoe Race, [[Kiandra]] c. 1900]]

Australia was a pioneer nation in the sport of ski racing, with annual ski races being conducted at [[Kiandra]] during the 19th Century. The [[Kiandra snow shoe club]] is easily one of the oldest ski clubs in the world.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/travel/travel-factsheet/kiandra--culture-and-history-20081121-6df7.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Kiandra - Culture and History}}</ref>  The club was formed around 1861 by three Norwegians, Elias Gottaas, Soren Torp and Carl Bjerknes on the Kiandra Gold Fields, NSW. This original Kiandra ski club is now recognised as the first snow ski club in the world, it also carries the distinction of being the longest continuously operating club. In 2006, the [[Holmenkollen Ski Museum]] confirmed that the first two ski clubs in the world were formed by Norwegians in 1861, "both in Australia and Norway".

Ski races were conducted from the 1860s onward and in 1908 the club held the world's first documented "International Ski Carnival". In addition to the International Downhill Race, events included races for boys under eight, ten, eleven and fourteen; boys and girls Open Championships were also conducted. The events concluded with a "New Chum" event and toboggan race.<ref>This has been referenced to "Kiandra : gold fields to ski fields" / by Norman W. Clarke.

===The Winter Olympics & World Cup Skiing===
[[Image:Stamp of Alisa Camplin 2002.jpg|right|thumb|Stamp of [[Alisa Camplin]] and her 2002 Olympic gold medal.]]
{{Main|Australia at the Winter Olympics}}
Australian skiers competed in the [[Winter Olympics]] for the first time in [[1952 Winter Olympics|Oslo]], 1952. Australian skiers have competed in all subsequent Winter Olympic Games and won medals at every Games since 1998<ref>http://www.olympics.com.au/australian-team/aus-at-the-winter-olympics</ref>. 

Australians have competed in Olympic [[Alpine Skiing]]; [[Biathlon]]; [[Cross Country Skiing]]; [[Freestyle Skiing]]; and also in [[Nordic Combined]] (one competitor in 1960)<ref>http://www.olympics.com.au/sports</ref>. Of these ski events, Australia has been most successful in the sport of [[Freestyle Skiing]] in which it has won Olympic medals, produced World Champions and over 100 world cup medals<ref name="olympics.com.au">http://www.olympics.com.au/sports/freestyle-skiing</ref>. 

[[Malcolm Milne]] competed for Australia in [[Alpine skiing]] at the 1968 and 1972 Olympic Games. His 1968  Olympics 24th placing in the Slalom Event remains the best performance by an Australian male in that event<ref>http://corporate.olympics.com.au/games/457/Grenoble+1968</ref>. In 1969 he became the first non-European to win a men's World Cup downhill event - winning first place at [[Val d'Is<U+00E8>re]]<ref name="blogs.theage.com.au">http://blogs.theage.com.au/travel/archives/2007/07/snow_divide_-_australia_vs_new_zealand.html</ref>.

Alpine skier Zali Steggall won Australia's first skiing medal at the 1998 [[Nagano Olympics]] winning bronze in the women's [[Slalom skiing|slalom]] event. Australian freestyle skiers emerged as a world force from the mid-1990s, when [[Kirstie Marshall]]  was placed 6th in the 1994 [[1994 Winter Olympics|Lillehammer Olympics]]<ref name="olympics.com.au"/>. The [[Olympic Winter Institute of Australia]] was established by the [[Australian Olympic Committee]] in June 1998 in an effort to improve the performances of its Australian Winter Olympic Teams<ref>http://corporate.olympics.com.au/index.cfm?p=57</ref>, and [[Alisa Camplin]] won Australia's first Olympic Gold Medal in the Freestyle Skiing Women's Aerials at the [[Salt Lake City Olympics]] in 2002. Camplin won Bronze at the subsequent [[Torino Olympics]] in 2006, while [[Dale Begg-Smith]] won Australia's second skiing Gold in 2006 in the Freestyle Skiing Men's [[Mogul skiing|Moguls]]<ref>http://corporate.olympics.com.au/index.cfm?p=641</ref><ref>A history of Australia's involvement at the Winter Olympics can be found on the Australian Olympic Committee's corporate website at [http://corporate.olympics.com.au/games.cfm?GamesID=461]</ref>.

The sport of [[snowboarding]] is also popular in the Australian skifields and Australia has been represented at the Olympics in this sport ever since it debuted at [[1998 Winter Olympics|Nagano]] in 1998<ref>http://www.olympics.com.au/sports/snowboard</ref>. [[Torah Bright]], of the [[Snowy Mountains]] town of [[Cooma]], New South Wales, won gold for Australia at the Vancouver Olympics in 2010 in the women's [[snowboard halfpipe]] event<ref>http://www.olympics.com.au/news/bright-lands-golden-run</ref>. Bright's gold medal - combined with the gold and silver skiing event medals - made 2010 Australia's most successful winter Olympic Games<ref>http://www.olympics.com.au/news/australia-records-best-ever-winter-games</ref>. The Australian team was the only Southern Hemisphere team to secure medals and was ranked 13th in the overall medal tally. Australia's two gold medals equalled the gold medal haul of former Winter Olympic host nation France and surpassed those of former host nations Italy, Japan and Croatia (in the Former Yugoslavia)<ref>http://www.olympics.com.au/countryTally</ref>.  A parodical bid for Australia to host the Olympic Games at [[Smiggin Holes]] was launched by satirical sports commentators [[Roy and HG]] during the [[Salt Lake City]] Olympics: see [[Smiggin Holes 2010 Winter Olympic bid]].

==Cross Country & Back Country Skiing==

[[File:Towards Kosciuszko from Kangaroo Ridge in winter.jpg|thumb|The  [[Main Range (Snowy Mountains)|Kosciuszko Main Range]].]]

The [[Main Range (Snowy Mountains)|Kosciuszko Main Range]] in the [[Snowy Mountains]] of New South Wales offer some of the most challenging cross-country and back-country skiing in Australia, notably [[Watsons Crags]] and [[Mount Twynam]] on the steep Western Face of the Range.<ref>http://www.ozbc.net/nsw_crags.htm</ref><ref>http://www.ozbc.net/nsw_twynamwest.htm</ref> The [[Mount Jagungal]] wilderness area provides some of the most isolated back-country ski terrain. High country huts, often a legacy of the era of cattle grazing in the mountains, provide emergency shelter in these regions.<ref>http://www.kosciuszkohuts.org.au/thehuts.html</ref> [[Seaman's Hut]], near Kosciusko, was built as a refuge in 1929 to commemorate Laurie Seaman, who was separated from his party and died in a 1928 blizzard while attempting to cross-country ski to Mount Kosciusko.<ref>http://www.snowymountains.com.au/High_Country_Huts.html</ref>

Dedicated Cross Country ski resorts are located at [[Lake Mountain]], [[Mount Sterling]] and [[Mount Saint Gwinear]] in Victoria and popular areas for back country skiing and ski touring in the [[Alpine National Park]], [[Yarra Ranges National Park]] and the [[Baw Baw National Park]] include: [[Mount Bogong]], [[Mount Feathertop]], [[Bogong High Plains]], [[Mount Howitt]], Mount Reynard and Snowy Plains. The [[Kangaroo Hoppet]] is a leg of the Worldloppet cross-country race series which is conducted  on the last Saturday of August each year, hosted by [[Falls Creek]] in Victoria. The showpiece 42-kilometre race  attracts thousands of spectators and competitors.<ref name="smh.com.au"/>

Cross country skiing can be possible in the [[Brindabella Ranges]] which rise to the west of [[Canberra]], in the A.C.T, and include the [[Namadgi National Park]] and [[Bimberi Nature Reserve]]. [[Mount Franklin, Australian Capital Territory|Mount Franklin Chalet]], built in 1938, in the A.C.T. played a pioneering role in providing lifted ski runs in Australia, however the chalet was converted to a museum and subsequently destroyed by fire in 2003, so today only cross country skiing can be practised in the area (when conditions allow).<ref>http://www.abc.net.au/stateline/act/content/2003/s826091.htm</ref> Cross Country skiing is also practised at [[Mount Gingera]], elevation 1855m, a prominent snow covered peak above the city of Canberra.<ref name="australia.com"/><ref name="ReferenceA"/>

When conditions allow, Australia's rugged island State of Tasmania also offers cross country skiers some scenic terrain - notably in the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage]] area around [[Cradle Mountain]].<ref name="parks.tas.gov.au"/> Tasmania has 28 mountains above 1,220m and much of the island is subject to at least occasional winter snow.<ref name="abs.gov.au"/> 

The Australian High Country is populated by unique flora and fauna including [[wombats]], [[Wallaby|wallabies]], [[echidnas]], and the [[Snow Gum]][http://www.smh.com.au/travel/50-reasons-to-love-australian-snow-20090603-bv3f.html?page=-1]. The Alpine regions are subject to environmental protection, which has limited the scope of commercial development of skiiable terrain<ref>See "Kosciuszko National Park: Contemporary Management". New South Wales Department of Education and Training, Riverina Environmental Education Centre.</ref>, however Australia has extensive [[cross country skiing]] terrain.<ref>http://www.hoppet.com.au/xc/</ref><ref>http://www.australia.com/destinations/icons/alps.aspx</ref>

A landmark expedition in early Australian cross country skiing was conducted in 1927, when William Hughes, of the [[Kiandra snow shoe club|Kiandra Snow Shoe Club]], together with four members of the Ski Club of Australia made the first historic ski traverse from Kiandra to the Hotel Kosciusko (now [[Sponars Chalet]]). Their eventful journey, via the [[Mount Jagungal]] Wilderness and across freezing rivers, is retold in Klaus Hueneke's book "Kiandra to Kosciusko" and was commemorated by 150 ski tourers in 1977 in an event organised by the [[Kosciusko Huts Association]][http://nordicskiclub.org.au/kag_arch/kiandra_to_kosciusko.shtml].

==Snow Conditions==

According to the Australian Government's "Bureau of Meteorology", in most years snow is sufficient above about 1500 metres to sustain a "viable ski industry". However, snow falls can vary greatly from year to year. In 1973 temperatures remained too warm, while in 1982 it was too dry for much of a snow season. However, some other years have abundant snow - the Bureau cites  1981 as an example. The unpredictability of Australian snow conditions was highlighted in 2006 when severe drought and a poor snow season gave way to a "White Christmas" and abundant snow falls in the alpine regions of New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania and even a low altitude snow fall on the 25th of December in the [[Dandenong Ranges]] on [[Melbourne]]'s north-eastern fringe<ref>http://www.bom.gov.au/inside/services_policy/public/sigwxsum/sigw1206.shtml</ref>. Snow making equipment at ski resorts has reduced uncertainty in recent times<ref>[http://www.bom.gov.au/lam/climate/levelthree/c20thc/temp.htm Discussion on Australian snow falls]</ref> . In New South Wales, a heavy natural snow season can see a base of up to 3.6 meters in August, at an elevation of 1830m at Spencer's Creek, (near [[Charlotte Pass]]) - see below chart. Typically, depths will be lower than this.<ref>http://www.snowyhydro.com.au/snowDepth.asp?pageID=46&parentID=6][http://www.bom.gov.au/lam/climate/levelthree/c20thc/temp5.htm</ref>

Low altitude and often dry climate; as well as seasonal (early spring) dust storms in the Simpson Desert depositing red dust on the ranges (causing less UV reflection and therefore faster melting) keep the snow season relatively short (June-Oct). Heavy snow can fall however, at anytime between April and December in the Australian High Country  (see chart from [[Snowy Hydro]]). The official opening of the ski season for most resorts coincides with the [[Queen's Official Birthday|Queens Birthday Long Weekend]] on the second Monday in June.
