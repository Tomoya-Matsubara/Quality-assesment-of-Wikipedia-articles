{{Wiktionary|orange}}
The word '''orange''' is both a [[noun]] and an [[adjective]] in the [[English language]]. In both cases, it refers primarily to the [[orange (fruit)|orange fruit]] and the [[orange (colour)|colour orange]], but has many other derivative meanings. 

The word derives from a [[Dravidian language]], and it passed through numerous other languages including [[Sanskrit]] and [[Old French]] before reaching the English language. The earliest uses of the word in English refer to the fruit, and the colour was later named after the fruit. Before the English-speaking world was exposed to the fruit, the colour was referred to as ''geoluhread'' (yellow-red) in [[Old English]] and [[Middle English]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Symbols and their hidden meanings |last=Kenner |first=T.A. |year=2006 |publisher=Thunders Mouth |location=New York |isbn=1560259493 |page=11 |pages=160}}</ref>

It is widely claimed that the word ''orange'' has no true [[rhyme]]. There are, however, [[half rhyme]]s or near-rhymes, as well as some [[proper noun]]s that rhyme with it. This lack of rhymes has inspired many humorous poems and songs.

== Etymology ==

The word ''orange'' entered [[Middle English]] from Old French and [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] ''orenge''.<ref name=OED2009>orange ''n''.<sup>1</sup> and ''adj''.<sup>1</sup> (March 2009) ''Oxford English Dictionary'' draft revision. Oxford: Oxford University Press.</ref> The earliest recorded use of the word in English is from the 13th century and referred to the fruit. The earliest attested use of the word in reference to the colour is from the 16th century.<ref name=OED2009/> It is generally thought that Old French borrowed the [[Italian language|Italian]] ''melarancio'' ("fruit of the orange tree", with ''mela'' "fruit") as ''pume orenge'' (with ''pume'' "fruit").<ref>{{cite book |title=Word Histories and Mysteries: From Abracadabra to Zeus |year=2004 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston |isbn=0618454500 |page=201 |pages=348}}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia |year=2000 |title=orange |encyclopedia=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=New York |isbn= 0395825172}}</ref> Although ''pume orenge'' is attested earlier than ''melarancio'' in available written sources, [[Lexicography|lexicographers]] believe that the Italian word is actually older.<ref>orange ''n''. and ''adj''.

The place name [[Orange, Vaucluse|''Orange'']] has a separate etymology. The Roman-Celtic settlement was founded in 36 or 35 [[Common Era|BCE]] and originally named Arausio, after a [[Celts|Celtic]] [[Arausio (god)|water god]].<ref>{{cite book |title=A Dictionary of the Roman Empire |last=Bunson |first=Matthew |year=1995 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford and New York |isbn=0195102339 |page=23 |pages=494}}</ref> The [[Principality of Orange]] was named for this place and not for the colour. Some time after the sixteenth century, though, the colour orange was adopted as a symbol of the [[House of Orange-Nassau]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Spanish Vocabulary: An Etymological Approach |last=Brodsky |first=David |year=2008 |publisher=University of Texas Press |location=Austin |isbn=0292716680 |page=257 |pages=637}}</ref> The colour eventually came to be associated with [[Protestantism]], due to participation by the House of Orange on the [[Protestant]] side in the [[French Wars of Religion]] and the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[Eighty Years' War]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Protestant Nations Redefined: Changing Perceptions of National Identity in the Rhetoric of the English, Dutch, and Swedish Public Churches, 1685-1772 |last=Ihalainen |first=Pasi |year=2005 |publisher=BRILL |location=Leiden and Boston |isbn=9004144854 |page=348 |pages=637}}</ref>

It is widely accepted that no single [[English language|English]] word is a true rhyme for ''orange'', though there are half rhymes such as ''hinge,'' ''lozenge,'' ''syringe,'' ''flange,'' ''[[Stonehenge]],'' or ''porridge.''<ref>{{cite book |title=Song and Significance: Virtues and Vices of Vocal Translation |last=Gorl<U+00E9>e |first=Dinda L. |year=2005 |publisher=Rodopi |location=Amsterdam |isbn=9042016876 |page=199 |pages=311}}</ref> Despite the fact that this property is [[List of English words without rhymes|not unique]] to the word{{mdash}} one study of 5,411 one-syllable English words found 80 words with no rhymes<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lawler |first1=John |year=2006 |title=The Data Fetishist<U+2019>s Guide to Rime Coherence |journal=Style |volume=40 |issue=1&2}}</ref>{{mdash}} the lack of rhyme for ''orange'' has garnered significant attention, and inspired many [[Light poetry|humorous verses]].

Although ''[[wikt:en:sporange|sporange]]'', a variant of ''[[sporangium]]'', is an [[eye rhyme]] for ''orange'', it is not a true rhyme as its second syllable is pronounced with an [[vowel reduction|unreduced vowel]] {{IPA|[-<U+00E6>nd<U+0292>]}}, and often [[stress (linguistics)|stressed]].

There are a number of proper nouns which rhyme or nearly rhyme with orange, including [[The Blorenge]], a mountain in [[Wales]], and [[Gorringe]], a [[surname]].  US Naval Commander [[Henry Honychurch Gorringe]], the captain of the ''[[USS Gettysburg (1858)|USS Gettysburg]]'' who discovered [[Gorringe Ridge]] in 1875,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/history/timeline/timeline.html#breakthrough |title=History of NOAA Ocean Exploration: The Breakthrough Years (1866-1922) |publisher=Oceanexplorer.noaa.gov |date= |accessdate=2009-07-03}}</ref> led [[Arthur Guiterman]] to quip in "Local Note":
:''In [[Sparkill, New York|Sparkill]] buried lies that man of mark''
:''Who brought [[Cleopatra's Needle (New York)|the Obelisk]] to [[Central Park]],''
:''Redoubtable Commander H.H. Gorringe,''

[[Compound word]]s or phrases may give true or near rhymes in some accents.  Examples include ''door-hinge'', ''torn hinge'', ''or inch'', and ''a wrench''. William Shepard Walsh attributes this verse featuring two multiple-word rhymes for orange to [[Walter William Skeat|W.W. Skeat]].
:''I gave my darling child a lemon,
:''That lately grew its fragrant stem on;
:''And next, to give her pleasure ''more'' range,
:''I offered her a juicy orange.
:''And nuts, she cracked them in the door-hinge.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Handy-book of Literary Curiosities |last=Walsh |first=William Shepard |location=Philadelphia |publisher=J.B. Lippincott |year=1892 |oclc=221721603}}</ref>

[[Enjambment]] can also provide for rhymes.  One example is [[Willard Espy]]'s poem, "The Unrhymable Word: Orange".
:''The four eng-''
:''ineers''
:''Wore orange''
:''brassieres.''<ref>{{cite book |title=A Man of my Words: Reflections on the English Language |last=Lederer |first=Richard |year=2003 |publisher=Macmillan |location=New York |isbn=0312317859}}</ref>

Another example by [[Tom Lehrer]] relies on the way many Americans pronounce ''orange'' as /<U+0251>r<U+0259>nd<U+0292>/, as opposed to /or<U+0259>nd<U+0292>/:
:''Eating an orange''
:''While making love''
:''Makes for bizarre enj-''
:''oyment thereof.''<ref>{{cite news |title=Tom Lehrer: Live & Off-color. In His Own Words: On Life, Lyrics and Liberals In His Own Words |author=Lehrer, Tom |newspaper=Washington Post |date=Jan 3 1982 |page=E1 |pages=2 }}</ref>

[[Nonce word]]s are sometimes contrived to rhyme with orange. Composers [[Charles Fox (composer)|Charles Fox]] and [[Norman Gimbel]] wrote the song "Oranges Poranges" to be sung by the Witchiepoo character on the television programme ''[[H.R. Pufnstuf]]''.
:''Oranges poranges, who says,''
:'' oranges poranges, who says,''
:''oranges poranges, who says?''
:''there ain't no rhyme for oranges!''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dt.prohosting.com/70s/childtv/krofft_facts.txt |title=The World of Sid & Marty Krofft Fact Sheet |date= |accessdate=2009-07-03}}</ref>
