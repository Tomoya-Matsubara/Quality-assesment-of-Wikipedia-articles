'''Hurricane Rick''' was the last hurricane in the [[1997 Pacific hurricane season]], the last named storm to form in the eastern Pacific, the second-last named storm of the season, and the second latest hurricane ever to make [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] in [[Mexico]]. Rick was a short-lived Category&nbsp;2 hurricane on the [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale]] that weakened before making landfall in Mexico on [[November 10]]. It hit almost a month after the more powerful [[Hurricane Pauline]] made landfall in the same country. Most of the damage associated with Pauline was exacerbated by the weaker Rick, which struck during rebuilding efforts.

Damage from Rick was fairly minor. As Rick was heading towards Mexico, the people on the coastline evacuated due to the impact of Pauline making them more prepared to deal with another hurricane, leading to no casualties.

==Storm history==
{{storm path|Rick 1997 track.png}}
Hurricane Rick's ultimate origin was a [[tropical wave]] that left Africa on October 15. While crossing the Atlantic, the wave was mainly tracked by continuity due to its lack or organization.<ref name="Hurricane Rick TCR">{{cite web|author=[[Max Mayfield]]|title=Tropical Cyclone Report: Hurricane Rick|accessdate=2007-12-29|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/1997rick.html|date=1997-11-23|publisher=[[National Hurricane Center]]}}</ref> After entering the Pacific, part of it developed cloudiness on November 5 when it was south of the [[Gulf of Tehuantepec]]. Organization and a circulation developed, and satellite tracking began on November 6. The disturbance became better organized and formed into Tropical Depression Nineteen-E on November 7.<ref name="Hurricane Rick TCR"/>

At first moving [[boxing the compass|northwest]], the depression was turned north by a [[trough (meteorology)|trough]]. Around noon on [[November 8]], when it was about {{convert|375|mi|km}} southwest of [[Acapulco]], the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Rick. The storm developed a cold central dense overcast, turned northeast, and became a hurricane on [[November 9]]. An [[eye (cyclone)|eye]] appeared that day, accompanied by a well-center visible on Acapulco [[weather radar|radar]]. The hurricane reached its peak intensity of {{convert|100|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} and 973&nbsp;mbar, making it a low-end Category&nbsp;2 on the [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale]];<ref name="Hurricane Rick TCR"/> However, some sources disagree, saying that Rick was a Category&nbsp;3 major hurricane at its peak.<ref name="Hurricane Rick Situation Report 1">{{cite web|publisher=[[ReliefWeb]]|date=1997-11-12|title=Mexico Hurricane Rick Situation Report No.1

==Preparations==
[[Image:Hurricane rick (1997).JPG|right|thumb|150px|Hurricane Rick on November 9 near peak intensity.]]
The pre-Rick tropical depression was a threat to Mexico. Hours before upgrading, Mexican officials issued a [[tropical cyclone watches and warnings|tropical storm watch]] for the area between [[L<U+00E1>zaro C<U+00E1>rdenas, Michoac<U+00E1>n]] and [[Puerto Escondido, Oaxaca]]. Three hours before Rick was upgraded to a hurricane, the watch was upgraded to a warning and a hurricane watch was issued and shortly afterward raised to a warning. On [[November 9]], the hurricane warning was extended to [[Zihuatanejo]] and [[Huatulco]]; warnings for areas west of Zihuatanejo and L<U+00E1>zaro C<U+00E1>rdenas were dropped at the same time. However, warnings for areas west of and including Acapulco remained until lifted three hours later. On [[November 10]], warnings were extended from [[Punta Maldonado]] to [[Tapachula]]; all warnings west of Punta Maldonado were dropped at that time. Then, Mexico's [[Interior Ministry (Mexico)|Interior Ministry]] declared a [[state of emergency]] along the [[Oaxaca]] coast.<ref name="Frederick Post">{{cite news|author=Associated Press|year=1997|title=New Storm Approaches Still-Battered Coast|publisher=Frederick Post|accessdate=2007-12-29|url=http://www.thehurricanearchive.com/Viewer.aspx?img=14811377_clean&firstvisit=true&src=search&currentResult=4&currentPage=0|page=A3|date=1997-11-10}}</ref> Six hours later, the warnings were downgraded to tropical storm warnings. These warnings remained until they were dropped when Rick was downgraded to a depression.<ref name="Hurricane Rick TCR"/>

The people in the coastal areas, most of which were already affected by the more catastrophic Pauline a month ago, were ready for Rick. All major ports along the coast were closed ahead of time in preparation, as well as airports in Huatulco and Puerto Escondido where power failures occurred because of Hurricane Rick.<ref name="Marysville Journal-Tribune"/> One hundred and thirty [[Red Cross]] workers, including twenty that were based in Mexico, who were in the area in the aftermath of Pauline, kept in the area to handle the second hurricane.<ref name="Casa Grande Dispatch">{{cite news|author=Associated Press|year=1997|title=Mexico Was Ready For Rick|publisher=Casa Grande Dispatch|accessdate=2007-12-29|url=http://www.thehurricanearchive.com/Viewer.aspx?img=112217650_clean&firstvisit=true&src=search&currentResult=2&currentPage=0|page=17|date=1997-11-11}}</ref> Many people from [[Puerto <U+00C1>ngel]], [[Huatulco]], and [[Puerto Escondido (Oaxaca)|Puerto Escondido]] (where National Operations Director Bernardino Heredia was overseeing recovery efforts<ref name="Casa Grande Dispatch"/>) beach areas were evacuated.<ref name="Casa Grande Dispatch 2">{{cite news|author=Associated Press|date=1997-11-10|title=Hurricane Rick hits Mexican coast|publisher=Casa Grande Dispatch|accessdate=2007-12-29|url=http://www.thehurricanearchive.com/Viewer.aspx?img=110968418_clean&firstvisit=true&src=search&currentResult=4&currentPage=0|page=2}}</ref> During the Puerto <U+00C1>ngel evacuation, helicopters landed carrying soldier and rifles, which one tourist likened to a third-world revolution.<ref name="Casa Grande Dispatch"/> In [[Chiapas]], officials watched for flooding along the rivers and upstream river valleys, where the rains from three previous systems caused the ground to saturate and in the state capital of [[Tuxtla Guti<U+00E9>rrez]], families were evacuated due to rising rivers.<ref name="Intelligencer">{{cite news|author=Niko Price|year=1997|title=Pauline's lessons save Mexico from Rick's wrath|publisher=The Intelligencer|accessdate=2007-12-29|url=http://www.thehurricanearchive.com/Viewer.aspx?img=26611330_clean&firstvisit=true&src=search&currentResult=1&currentPage=0|page=C4|date=1997-11-11}}</ref>

==Impact==
[[image:Rick1997filledrainblk.gif|200px|right|thumb|Rainfall map of the hurricane]]
The damage from Rick was minor in comparison to [[Hurricane Pauline|Pauline]]. In Oaxaca, the hurricane was responsible for dumping {{convert|10|in|mm}} of rain onto the state, which in turn resulted in mudslides and flash floods in areas earlier ravaged by Pauline.<ref name="Australia Severe Weather">{{cite web|author=Gary Padgett|year=1997|title=Monthly Global Tropical Cyclone Summary: November, 1997|accessdate=2008-08-28|publisher=Australia Severe Weather|url=http://australiasevereweather.com/cyclones/1998/summ9711.htm}}</ref> These rains also resulted in the sea level rising three feet above normal levels due to high waves generated during its passage. The hurricane was also responsible for rendering bridges and roads unpassable in the state, which had only recently been repaired after they were damaged by two prior hurricanes: 1995's [[Hurricane Roxanne]] in the Atlantic <ref name="Marysville Journal-Tribune"/> and Pauline, which had weakened bridges a month prior, allowing Rick to topple them,<ref name="Intelligencer 2">{{cite web|author=Associated Press|year=1997|title=Earthweek: A Diary of the Planet|publisher=Intelligencer|date=1997-11-16|accessdate=2007-12-29|url=http://www.thehurricanearchive.com/Viewer.aspx?img=37211366_clean&firstvisit=true&src=search&currentResult=6&currentPage=10|page=E3|author=Steve Newman}}</ref> including a bridge near Puerto Escondido which left a {{convert|15|ft|m|sing=on}} deep gap in the road.<ref name="Casa Grande Dispatch 2"/> Among the major roads that were cut off were a mountain road from Puerto Angel to [[Oaxaca City]], a route used to link the coast with [[Mexico City]], and a route from Puerto Escondido with Acapulco.<ref name="Casa Grande Dispatch 2"/> A total of {{convert|10.47|in|mm}} of rainfall, the highest total caused by Rick, was recorded in Astata/San Pedro Huameluca, which was near the point where the hurricane made landfall.<ref name=HPC>{{cite web|publisher=[[Hydrometeorological Prediction Center]]|url=http://www.hpc.ncep.noaa.gov/tropical/rain/rick1997rain.gif|title=Hurricane Rick Storm Total Rainfall Graphic|format=GIF|accessdate=2007-12-29|author=[[David M. Roth]]}}</ref> Telephone communications and traffic were cut off to many villages in the wake of the hurricane.<ref name="Hurricane Rick TCR"/>

Although Rick was much weaker than Pauline, there were some areas where Rick's impact was greater than that of Pauline's. One such place was the village of El Tomatal, located {{convert|10|mi|km}} southeast of Puerto Escondido. There, eight houses were destroyed and roofs were torn off of many others, which residents attributed to more rain than in Pauline, even though the winds were roughly equal.<ref name="Intelligencer"/>
Although there were no casualties, the hurricane caused more than 2000 people to become homeless.<ref name="Australia Severe Weather"/> Most of what Pauline had left behind was destroyed by Rick, which one resident said was like "Pauline came to harvest the corn, and Rick came to harvest the peanuts."<ref name="Intelligencer"/>

In the [[United States]], Rick had a temporary economic impact when, during its time off the shore of Chiapas and Oaxaca, it caused the price of coffee to rise 4.7 percent to $1.5685 per pound on the [[Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange]] in New York, the highest total it reached since October 16. Mexico is the United States's largest source of coffee imports and Oaxaca and Chiapas are the largest coffee growing regions in Mexico. Like the impact in El Tomatal, Rick's effects were much worse than Pauline's because Rick threatened the coffee crop when the beans were more susceptible to winds that could blow them off.<ref name="New York Times">{{cite web|author=New York Times|year=1997|title=FUTURES MARKETS; Coffee Prices Surge as Storm Threatens Mexican Harvest

===Records===
Rick was one of only six known hurricanes to form in the East Pacific in November. The others were [[Hurricane Nina (1957)|Nina]] in 1957, [[1950-1969 Pacific hurricane seasons#1961|Tara]] in 1961, [[1972 Pacific hurricane season#Hurricane/Typhoon Ruby|Ruby]] in 1972, [[Hurricane Iwa|Iwa]] in 1982, [[1991 Pacific hurricane season#Hurricane Nora|Nora]] in 1991, and [[Hurricane Sergio (2006)|Sergio]] in 2006. Rick was the second one of these to make landfall, although it was the third weakest of them, just slightly stronger than Nina and Iwa (Tara's central pressure is unknown).<ref name="EPac best track">{{cite web|publisher=[[National Hurricane Center]]|title=Eastern North Pacific Tracks File 1949-2007|accessdate=2008-08-20|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/tracks1949to2007_epa.txt|format=Plain text|date=2008-03-21}}</ref> Rick is also the second-latest hurricane in official records to have hit either coast of Mexico, behind only Tara.<ref name="EPac best track"/><ref name="Atlantic best track">{{cite web|publisher=[[National Hurricane Center]]|title=Atlantic Tracks File 1851-2007|accessdate=2008-08-20|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/tracks1851to2007_atl_reanal.txt|format=Plain text|date=2008-04-22}}</ref>
