"'''White Christmas'''" is an [[Irving Berlin]] song reminiscing about an [[White Christmas (weather)|old-fashioned Christmas setting]].  According to the ''[[Guinness Book of World Records]]'', the version sung by [[Bing Crosby]] is the [[list of best-selling singles worldwide|best-selling]] [[single (Music)|single]] of all time, with estimated sales in excess of 50 million copies worldwide. All other versions of the song, along with Bing Crosby's, has estimated sales over 100 million copies.<ref name=Guinness07>[http://img299.imageshack.us/img299/3315/guinness2007.pdf Guinness Book of Records, 2007 Edition, page 187]</ref><ref>[http://img38.imageshack.us/img38/8412/guinness2008.pdf Guinness Book of Records, 2008 Edition, page 181]</ref><ref name=Guinness09>[http://img827.imageshack.us/img827/4387/guinness2009.pdf Guinness Book of Records, 2009 Edition, pages 14, 15 & 169]</ref><ref name=best/>

[[File:Single_Bing_Crosby_-_White_Christmas_cover.jpg|200px|thumb|Picture sleeve of 1959 reissue by Decca Records <small>(9-23778)</small>]]
The first public performance of the song was by [[Bing Crosby]], on his [[NBC]] radio show [[Kraft Music Hall|''The Kraft Music Hall'']] on Christmas Day, 1941; a copy of the recording from the radio program is owned by the estate of Bing Crosby and was loaned to CBS Sunday Morning for their December 25, 2011, program.<ref name=best/> He subsequently recorded the song with the John Scott Trotter Orchestra and the [[Ken Darby Singers]] for [[Decca Records]] in just 18 minutes on May 29, 1942, and it was released on July 30 as part of an album of six 78-rpm songs from the film [[Holiday Inn (film)|''Holiday Inn'']].<ref name=best/><ref name="Mueller"/> At first, Crosby did not see anything special about the song. He just said "I don't think we have any problems with that one, Irving."<ref>{{cite journal|journal=TIME|url=http://entertainment.time.com/2012/12/17/yule-laugh-yule-cry-10-things-you-didnt-know-about-beloved-holiday-songs/?iid=tl-article-recirc|title=Yule Laugh, Yule Cry: 10 Things You Didn<U+2019>t Know About Beloved Holiday Songs (With holiday cheer in the air, ''TIME'' takes a closer look at some of the weird stories behind our favorite seasonal tunes)| author=Wook Kim|date=Dec. 17, 2012}} - [http://entertainment.time.com/2012/12/17/yule-laugh-yule-cry-10-things-you-didnt-know-about-beloved-holiday-songs/?iid=tl-article-recirc "White Christmas" (p. 6)]</ref> 

The song initially performed poorly and was overshadowed by [[Holiday Inn (film)|Holiday Inn's]] first hit song: "Be Careful, It's my Heart".<ref name="Mueller"/> By the end of October 1942, however, "White Christmas" topped the "[[Your Hit Parade]]" chart.  It remained in that position until well into the new year.<ref name="Mueller"/> (It has often been noted that the mix of melancholy&nbsp;<U+2014> "just like the ones I used to know"&nbsp;<U+2014> with comforting images of home&nbsp;<U+2014> "where the treetops glisten"&nbsp;<U+2014> resonated especially strongly with listeners during [[World War II]].  The [[Armed Forces Network]] was flooded with requests for the song.  The song is noted for Crosby's whistling during the second Chorus.<ref name="Mueller"/>)

In 1942 alone, Crosby's recording spent eleven weeks on top of the [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' charts]].  The original version also hit number one on the [[Harlem Hit Parade]] for three weeks,<ref>{{cite book |title= Top R&B/Hip-Hop Singles: 1942-2004|last=Whitburn |first=Joel |authorlink=Joel Whitburn |year=2004 |publisher=Record Research |page=139}}</ref> Crosby's first-ever appearance on the black-oriented chart. Re-released by Decca, the single returned to the #1 spot during the holiday seasons of 1945 and 1946 (on the chart dated January 4, 1947), thus becoming the only single with three separate runs at the top of the U.S. charts. The recording became a chart perennial, reappearing annually on the pop chart twenty separate times before [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'' magazine]] created a distinct Christmas chart for seasonal releases.

Following its prominence in the [[Musical film|musical]] ''[[Holiday Inn (film)|Holiday Inn]]'', the composition won the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] in 1942.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums">{{cite book

The version most often heard today is not the original 1942 Crosby recording, as the [[Audio mastering|master]] had become damaged due to frequent use. Crosby re-recorded the track on March 18, 1947, accompanied again by the Trotter Orchestra and the Darby Singers, with every effort made to reproduce the original recording session.<ref name="Lyrics" /> There are subtle differences in the orchestration, most notably the addition of a celesta and flutes to brighten up the introduction.

Crosby was dismissive of his role in the song's success, saying later that "a [[jackdaw]] with a [[cleft palate]] could have sung it successfully."  But Crosby was associated with it for the rest of his career.  Another Crosby vehicle <U+2014> the 1954 musical ''[[White Christmas (film)|White Christmas]]'' <U+2014> was the highest-grossing film of 1954.

==Sales figures==
Crosby's "White Christmas" single has been credited with selling 50 million copies, the most by any release and therefore it is the biggest-selling single worldwide of all time. The ''Guinness Book of World Records'' 2009 Edition lists the song as a 100-million seller, encompassing all versions of the song, including albums.<ref name=Guinness09/><ref name=best/> Crosby's holiday collection ''Merry Christmas'' was first released as an [[Vinyl record|LP]] in 1949, and has never been out of print since.

There has been some confusion and considerable debate on whether Crosby's record is or is not the best-selling single in the world, due to a lack of information on sales of "White Christmas," because Crosby's recording was released before the advent of the modern-day US and UK singles charts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.riaa.com/newsitem.php?resultpage=2&id=3abf3ec8-ef5b-58f9-e949-3b57f5e313df|title=RIAA News Room - The American Recording Industry Announces its Artists of the Century - Nov 10, 1999|date=1999-11-10|work=Recording Industry Association of America website|publisher=[[RIAA]]|accessdate=2010-02-08.}}</ref> However, after careful research, ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' in 2007 concluded that, worldwide, Crosby's recording of "White Christmas" has, in their estimation, sold at least 50 million copies, and that [[Elton John]]'s recording of "[[Candle in the Wind 1997]]" has sold 33 million, making Crosby's recording the best-selling single of all time.<ref name=Guinness07/> However, an update in the 2009 edition of the book decided to further help settle the controversy amicably by naming both John's and Crosby's songs to be "winners" by stating that John's recording is the "best-selling single since UK and US singles charts began in the 1950s," while maintaining that "the best-selling single of all time was released before the first pop charts," and that this distinction belongs to "White Christmas," which it says "was listed as the world's best-selling single in the first-ever [[Guinness Book of Records]] (published in 1955) and - remarkably - still retains the title more than 50 years later."<ref name=Guinness>{{cite book |title=''Guinness Book of Records'' 2009 states that "Candle in the Wind 1997" is the "best-selling single since charts began"; however, not of all time. Bing Crosby's "White Christmas" is still recognized as the best selling single of all time, but since it was released prior to the start of many charts, its sales prior to the 1950s are estimated. John's 1997 song has sold the most copies when looking at copies sold since charts began, as verified in ''Guinness World Records''|isbn=1-904994-37-7}} See also: Guinness Book of Records, 2009 Edition, pages 14, 15 & 169 [http://img827.imageshack.us/img827/4387/guinness2009.pdf]</ref>

==Historic influence==
In 1999, [[National Public Radio]] included it in the "NPR 100", which sought to compile the one hundred most important American musical works of the 20th century.  Crosby's version of the song also holds the distinction of being ranked #2 on the "[[Songs of the Century]]" list, behind only [[Judy Garland]]'s "[[Over the Rainbow]]," as voted by members of the RIAA.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/SHOWBIZ/Music/03/07/365.songs/ | work=CNN | title=New song list puts 'Rainbow' way up high | date=March 7, 2001}}</ref> In 2002, the original 1942 version was one of 50 historically significant recordings chosen that year by the [[Library of Congress]] to be added to the [[National Recording Registry]].

The recording was broadcast on the radio on April 30, 1975, as a secret, pre-arranged signal precipitating the [[Operation Frequent Wind|U.S. evacuation]] from [[Saigon]] (see [[Fall of Saigon]], the end of [[Vietnam War]]). {{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}

==Original introduction==
Irving Berlin's opening bars are often dropped in recordings, but are included on ''[[A Christmas Gift for You from Philles Records]]'', sung by [[Darlene Love]], on [[Barbra Streisand]]'s ''[[A Christmas Album (Barbra Streisand album)|A Christmas Album]]'', on [[The Carpenters]] ''[[Christmas Portrait]]'' sung by Karen Carpenter, on [[Bette Midler]]'s ''[[Cool Yule]]'', on [[Libera (music)|Libera]]'s ''Christmas Album'' and on [[Crash Test Dummies]]' ''[[Jingle All the Way (Crash Test Dummies album)|Jingle All the Way]]''.<ref name="Lyrics" />

This opening verse was also included on country singer [[Collin Raye]]'s version of the song, as featured on his 2004 album, ''[[Christmas: The Gift]]''.  British band [[Keane (band)|Keane]]'s version of the song also included this introduction, but with changed lyrics to give the song a melancholic feeling:
