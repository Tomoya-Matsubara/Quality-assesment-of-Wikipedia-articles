{{Nihongo|'''Hideki Hosaka'''|<U+4FDD><U+5742> <U+79C0><U+6A39>|Hosaka Hideki}} is a Japanese [[professional wrestler]], who is best known for his work in [[Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling]], [[All Japan Pro Wrestling]], and [[Pro Wrestling Zero1|Pro Wrestling Zero-One]].

==Career==
===Early career (1991<U+2013>1993)===
An amateur wrestler in his scholastic years, he enrolled in Submission Arts Wrestling in May 1990. After over a year of training, he joined Wrestling International New Generations (W*ING) in August 1991. In W*ING he trained with wrestlers including [[Greg Wojciechowski|The Great Wojo]], [[Savio Vega|TNT]], and [[Mr. Pogo]]. In 1992, he left W*ING and joined the Takano Brothers' Pro Wrestling Crusaders, under the [[ring name]] Benkei. As PWC did not run regular shows, he transferred to [[Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling]] (FMW) a year later.

===Promoted career (1993<U+2013>2004)===
Hosaka made his debut for FMW in 1993, siding with his W*ING friends Mr. Pogo and Mitsuhiro Matsunaga. He competed against [[Atsushi Onita]] in several [[Professional wrestling match types#Hardcore-based variations|street fights]] and [[Hardcore wrestling|deathmatches]] for well over a year. In February 1995 he won his first championship, the [[Independent Junior Heavyweight Championship|FMW Independent World Junior Heavyweight Championship]], by defeating [[Ricky Fuji]]. He reigned as champion for two months, before losing the title to [[Koji Nakagawa]]. During his time in FMW, he also wrestled on various W*ING Reunion shows. In September 1997, the W*ING [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Stable|faction]] disbanded, due to [[W*ING Kanemura]]'s loss to Onita, as Hosaka joined Onita and Kanemura to form a group called ZEN. In May 1998, he wrestle his first match for [[All Japan Pro Wrestling]] at their [[Tokyo Dome]] show. After ZEN disbanded in May 1998, he joined Onita's Team Zero, until Onita finally left the promotion in November 1998. That same month, he wrestled a match for [[BattlARTS]]. In 2000, he won three [[WEW Hardcore Tag Team Championship]]s with Mammoth Sasaki, before leaving FMW in 2001 in an exodus that also included [[Masato Tanaka]], [[Jado]], [[Gedo (wrestler)|Gedo]], and Kaori Nakayama.

After wrestling a couple of W*ING Reunion shows in April 2001, Hosaka joined [[All Japan Pro Wrestling]] as a freelancer, before signing with the company in 2002. In 2003, he would balance his time in AJPW with [[Pro Wrestling Zero1|Pro Wrestling Zero-One]]. By 2004, he was back wrestling solely for AJPW, but a major knee injury forced him out of action and he left AJPW.

===Freelance (2006<U+2013>present)===
After fully recovering from his knee injury, Hosaka returned to the ring as a freelancer, which include stints in Wrestling Marvelous Future, Team Vader, and [[Ice Ribbon]], before retiring in February 2008.

In 2010, Hosaka came out of retirement and returned to the ring as a freelancer, aligned with Atsushi Onita and Ichiro Yaguchi.
