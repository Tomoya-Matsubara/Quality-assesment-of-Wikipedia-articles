==Background==

===History===
Paul Seymour was an enrolled member of the [[Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation]], a group of twelve Indian tribes that are based at the Colville Indian Reservation.  The reservation is located in the western part of [[Oregon]] and the eastern part of [[Washington (state)|Washington]].  The reservation was established by the [[executive order]] of [[President of the United States|President]] [[Ulysses S. Grant]] on 2 July 1872.<ref name=Kappler1>{{smallcaps|[http://digital.library.okstate.edu/Kappler/Vol1/Images/v1p0915.jpg 1 Indian Affairs: Laws and Treaties]}} 915-916 (Charles J. Kappler, ed., 1904).</ref>  In 1892, [[United States Congress|Congress]] opened up part of the reservation to white settlement.<ref name=Stat1>{{usstat|27|62}}.</ref><ref name=Kappler2>{{smallcaps|[http://digital.library.okstate.edu/Kappler/Vol1/HTML_files/SES0441.html 1 Indian Affairs: Laws and Treaties]}} 441-443 (Charles J.

Kappler, ed., 1929).</ref>

===Lower courts===
Seymour was charged with [[burglary]] in [[Okanogan County, Washington]] and pleaded guilty to attempted burglary.  He was sentenced to 7-1/2 years in the state [[prison|penitentiary]].  While incarcerated, he filed a petition for a writ of ''[[habeas corpus]]'' in the [[Washington Supreme Court]].  The state Supreme Court denied the petition on the grounds that the offense did not take place in "Indian country".<ref name=WSC>In re Seymour v. Schneckloth, [http://174.123.24.242/leagle/xmlResult.aspx?page=1&xmldoc=195916455Wn2d109_1152.xml&docbase=CSLWAR1-1950-1985&SizeDisp=7 346 P.2d 669] (Wash. 1959).</ref>  Indian country is defined in federal law as including all land within an Indian reservation, and within Indian country, only the Federal government has [[jurisdiction]] over crimes committed by Indians.<ref name=USC1>{{usc|18|1151|1153}}.</ref><ref name=Matal>{{smallcaps|Joseph D.

The court denied the writ.<ref name=WSC />  Seymour then appealed to the United States Supreme Court, which agreed to hear the appeal and granted a writ of [[certiorari]].<ref name=SCOTUS />

==Opinion of the court==
[[File:HugoLaFayetteBlack.jpg|thumb|left|200px|alt=Justice Hugo Black portrait|Justice Hugo Black, author of the unanimous opinion]]

===Arguments===
Glen A. Wilkinson argued the case for Seymour.  Washington Assistant Attorney General Stephen C. Way argued the case for the state of Washington.  At the request of the court [[United States Solicitor General]] [[J. Lee Rankin]] filed a memorandum with the court.<ref name=SCOTUS />

===Unanimous opinion===
[[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Justice]] [[Hugo Black]] announced the opinion of a unanimous court.  Black looked to the statutes that affected the Colville Indian Reservation and noted that the 1892 act expressly reserved the southern half for use of the tribes under control of the federal government.<ref name=Stat1 /><ref name=Kappler2 />  The 1916 presidential proclamation merely set forth the procedure for settlement, and neither the proclamation nor the enabling act had any language terminating the reservation.<ref name=Stat2 /><ref name=Kappler3 /><ref name=Koski>{{smallcaps|Charlene Koski}}, ''[https://digital.lib.washington.edu/dspace-law/bitstream/handle/1773.1/178/Koski_Author%20Copy.pdf?sequence=1 The Legacy of Solem v.

Black observed that those conditions had not yet been met.<ref name=SCOTUS />  The statutes opening up the reservation to settlement merely allowed non-Indians to move onto the reservation and did not end reservation status.<ref name=Barsh>{{smallcaps|Russell Lawrence Barsh & James Youngblood Henderson}}, {{smallcaps|The Road: Indian Tribes and Political Liberty}} 178-181 (1982).</ref>

Black stated that "Since the burglary with which petitioner was charged occurred on property plainly located within the limits of that reservation, the courts of Washington had no jurisdiction to try him for that offense."<ref name=SCOTUS />  The case was reversed and remanded to the Washington Supreme Court.<ref name=Matal />
