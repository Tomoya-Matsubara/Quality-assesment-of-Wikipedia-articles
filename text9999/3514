"'''Twenty-Five Miles'''" is a song written by [[Johnny Bristol]], [[Harvey Fuqua]], and [[Edwin Starr]] for Starr's second album, ''25 Miles'' (1968). The song reached #6 on the US singles charts, and #36 in the UK. The song was considered sufficiently similar to "32 Miles out of Waycross" by Hoagy Lands (also recorded as "Mojo Mama" by both Wilson Picket and Don Varner), written by [[Bert Berns]] and [[Jerry Ragovoy]], that Berns and Ragovoy were eventually given co-writing credits.

The [[Jackson 5]] recorded a cover version of "Twenty-Five Miles" in 1969, but it was not heard until its inclusion on the [[Motown]] compilation album ''[[The Original Soul of Michael Jackson]]'' in 1987, with [[Michael Jackson]] being given sole performer credit for the track. It was not the original recording, however, as it included drum machine overdubs. 

Jackson's version of "Twenty-Five Miles" was released as a single in the US to promote ''The Original Soul of Michael Jackson''. The single was backed by the song "Up on the Housetop".<ref>{{cite book |last=Halstead |first=Craig |authorlink= |coauthors=Chris Cadman |title=[[Michael Jackson]]: The Solo Years |year=2003 |publisher=Authors OnLine |location= |id=ISBN 0-7552-0091-8 }}</ref> The original recording of the song was included on the 2009 set ''[[Hello World: The Motown Solo Collection]]''.

The Edwin Starr version was featured in the movies ''[[Adventures_in_Babysitting|Adventures In Babysitting]]'' and ''[[Dead Presidents]]''. A shortened remix of the Edwin Starr version was used as the theme song for NFL Network's coverage of the 2011 NFL scouting combine.<ref>{{cite web|last=2011 NFL Scouting Combine|title=http://www.nfl.com/videos/nfl-combine/09000d5d81e6c089/2011-Combine-Open}}</ref>
