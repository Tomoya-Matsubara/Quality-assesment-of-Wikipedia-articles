'''Jos<U+00E9> Canseco Capas, Jr.''' (born July 2, 1964), is a Cuban-American former [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) [[outfielder]], and [[designated hitter]]. He last played for the AAA [[Quintana Roo Tigres]] of the [[Mexican Baseball League]]<ref name="nbcmar8">{{cite web|url=http://hardballtalk.nbcsports.com/2012/03/08/shocker-jose-canseco-banned-from-mexican-league-due-to-doping-claim/|title=Shocker: Jose Canseco banned from Mexican league due to doping claim|last=Calcaterra|first=Craig|date=March 8, 2012|work=NBC Sports|accessdate=8 March 2012}}</ref>, however he was banned from the Mexican League in 2012 for refusing to submit to a drug test and admitting to taking testosterone.<ref name="nbcmar8"/> He played for the [[Oakland Athletics]] (1985<U+2013>1992, 1997) [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] (1992<U+2013>1994), [[Boston Red Sox]] (1995<U+2013>1996), [[Toronto Blue Jays]] (1998), [[Tampa Bay Rays|Tampa Bay Devil Rays]] (1999<U+2013>2000), [[New York Yankees]] (2000) and [[Chicago White Sox]] (2001). During his career, Canseco was a six-time [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]], four-time [[Silver Slugger Award]] winner, [[Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award|American League (AL) Rookie of the Year]], and [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|AL Most Valuable Player]].

Canseco has admitted using [[performance enhancing drugs]] during his playing career, and wrote a tell-all book, ''[[Juiced: Wild Times, Rampant 'Roids, Smash Hits & How Baseball Got Big]]'', in which he claimed that the vast majority of MLB players use [[steroids]].

Canseco is the [[identical twin]] brother of former major league player [[Ozzie Canseco]]. After retiring from Major League Baseball, he also competed in [[boxing]] and [[mixed martial arts]].

==Early years==
Canseco was born in [[Havana, Cuba]], and left Cuba with his cousins and family when he and his identical twin brother were infants. They relocated to the [[United States]], with Jos<U+00E9> and Ozzie growing up in the [[Miami, Florida]] area, and attending [[Miami Coral Park High School|Coral Park High School]].

==Baseball career (1982&ndash;present)==
===Minor league baseball (1982<U+2013>1985)===
The [[Oakland Athletics]] drafted Canseco in the 15th round of the [[1982 Major League Baseball Draft]]. He played [[minor league baseball]] with the [[Madison Muskies]], [[Idaho Falls Chukars|Idaho Falls A's]], and the [[Modesto Nuts|Modesto A's]].  Canseco started the 1985 season with the Class-AA [[Huntsville Stars]] and became known as "Parkway Jose",{{cn|date=March 2012}} for his long home runs (25 in half a season), that went close to the [[Memorial Parkway (Huntsville)|Memorial Parkway]] behind [[Joe Davis Stadium]].

===Major League Baseball (1985&ndash;2001)===
====Oakland Athetics (1985<U+2013>92)====
In 1985, Canseco won the [[Baseball America Minor League Player of the Year Award]], and was a late season call-up for the [[Oakland Athletics]], playing in 29 games in the major leagues in {{by|1985}}. He gained notoriety in {{by|1986}}, his first full season, being named the [[American League]]'s [[MLB Rookie of the Year Award|Rookie of the Year]], with 33 [[home run]]s and 117 [[runs batted in]]. In {{by|1987}}, [[Mark McGwire]] joined Canseco on the Athletics; McGwire hit 49 home runs that year and was also named the American League Rookie of the Year. Together, he and Canseco formed a fearsome offensive tandem, known as the "Bash Brothers".

In {{by|1988}}, Canseco became the first player in major league history to [[40-40 club|hit at least 40 home runs and steal at least 40 bases]] in the same year, by hitting 42 home runs and stealing 40 bases. After that, the street in front of his former high school was named after him and later rescinded in 2008 after he admitted to previously using drugs throughout his career.<ref>[http://www.co.miami-dade.fl.us/govaction/matter.asp?matter=082338&file=true&yearFolder=Y2008]</ref><ref>[http://www.upi.com/Sports_News/2008/09/09/Name-change-for-Jose-Canseco-Street/UPI-56121220990265/]</ref> That same year, he helped the Athletics to the [[1988 World Series|World Series]] but they lost to the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] in five games. Canseco was unanimously named the American League's [[MLB Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player]] in 1988, with a .307 [[batting average]], 120 [[run (baseball)|runs scored]], 124 RBI, 42 home runs, and 40 [[stolen base]]s.

In {{by|1989}}, Canseco missed all but 65 of the regular season games with a broken wrist, but he still managed to hit 17 home runs as the Athletics won their first [[1989 World Series|World Series]] since [[1974 World Series|1974]], beating the [[San Francisco Giants]] in four games. The 1989 Series was interrupted before Game 3 by [[Loma Prieta earthquake|a major earthquake]] in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]].

Canseco came back to form in {{by|1990}}, hitting 37 home runs despite being hampered in the latter part of the season by what would become a recurring back problem. The A's returned to the [[1990 World Series|World Series]] once again, but were swept by the [[Cincinnati Reds]] in four games. Canseco continued to be productive, hitting 44 home runs in {{by|1991}}, but his career hit a plateau, and in the face of frequent injuries and controversy he never accomplished what many felt he was capable of.

====Texas Rangers (1992<U+2013>94)====
On August 31, {{by|1992}}, in the middle of a game and while he was in the on-deck circle, the A's traded Canseco to the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] for [[Rub<U+00E9>n Sierra]], [[Jeff Russell]], and [[Bobby Witt]].

On May 26, {{by|1993}}, during a game against the [[Cleveland Indians]], [[Carlos Mart<U+00ED>nez (infielder)|Carlos Mart<U+00ED>nez]] hit a fly ball that Canseco lost sight of as he was crossing the [[warning track]]. The ball hit him in the head and bounced over the wall for a home run.<ref>[http://www.baseballlibrary.com/ballplayers/player.php?name=jose_canseco_1964 The Ballplayers <U+2013> Jose Canseco]</ref> The cap<ref>[http://seth.com/coll_memorabilia_03.html Seth.com A Head's-Up Play]</ref> Canseco was wearing on that play, which ''[[This Week in Baseball]]'' rated in 1998 as the greatest [[blooper]] of the show's first 21 years, is in the [[Seth Swirsky]] collection. After the incident, the [[Harrisburg Heat]] offered him a soccer contract.<ref>{{Cite news|url= http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE1DD113BF93BA15756C0A965958260&n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fPeople%2fC%2fCanseco%2c%20Jose|title= New York Times article | work=The New York Times | date=May 28, 1993 | accessdate=May 7, 2010}}</ref> Three days later, Canseco asked his [[manager (baseball)|manager]], [[Kevin Kennedy (baseball)|Kevin Kennedy]], to let him pitch the eighth inning of a runaway loss to the [[Boston Red Sox]]; he injured his arm, underwent [[Tommy John surgery]], and was lost for the remainder of the season.  In his pitching appearance, Canseco allowed three earned runs on two hits and three walks, throwing 33 pitches, but only 12 for strikes.<ref>{{cite web|title=May 29, 1993 Texas Rangers at Boston Red Sox|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/BOS/BOS199305290.shtml|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|accessdate=23 March 2012}}</ref> 

In the 1994 strike shortened season, Canseco again returned to his former status of power hitter with 31 home runs and 90 RBI in 111 games. Canseco also stole 15 bases and posted a .282 batting average. He was named comeback player of the year in 1994, and finished in eleventh place in the American League Most Valuable Player voting.

====Final MLB seasons (1995<U+2013>2001)====
After playing with the Rangers from 1992 to 1994, Canseco moved on to play with the Boston Red Sox from 1995 to 1996. Following an unsuccessful return with the A's in {{by|1997}}, Canseco did have a productive season again with the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] in {{by|1998}}, when he hit 46 home runs and stole 29 bases, the most he had stolen since the 40 he stole in 1988. He won the AL Silver Slugger award, but his comeback was missed by most fans because of the home run race in the National League between Mark McGwire and [[Sammy Sosa]].

Canseco went to the [[Tampa Bay Devil Rays]] in {{by|1999}}, where he hit 34 home runs in 114 games and was named to the AL All-Star team, until he injured his back and was lost for the season. He was claimed off waivers by the [[New York Yankees]] in August 2000, which caught many, including [[List of New York Yankees managers|Yankees manager]] [[Joe Torre]] off guard, as the Yankees had four other players who fulfilled a similar role to Canseco.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2000/08/08/sports/baseball-yanks-get-canseco-but-the-question-is-why.html?scp=2&sq=Jose+Canseco&st=nyt | work=The New York Times | first=Buster | last=Olney | title=BASEBALL; Yanks Get Canseco, but the Question Is Why? | date=August 8, 2000}}</ref> [[List of New York Yankees owners and executives|Yankees General Manager]] [[Brian Cashman]] made the claim to prevent the Blue Jays, who were in a close race with the Yankees, from acquiring Canseco.<ref name=worsttime/> He made one appearance in the [[2000 World Series]] against the [[New York Mets]]. Canseco later called his Yankees tenure "the worst time of [his] life" due to receiving limited playing time.<ref name=worsttime>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/26/sports/baseball-notebook-canseco-calls-yankee-tenure-the-worst-time-of-my-life.html | work=The New York Times | first=Buster | last=Olney | title=BASEBALL: NOTEBOOK; Canseco Calls Yankee Tenure 'The Worst Time of My Life' | date=March 26, 2001}}</ref>

Canseco played with the [[Chicago White Sox]] in {{by|2001}}, after being cut by the [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim|Anaheim Angels]] in spring training and spending half of the season with the [[Newark Bears]] of the independent [[Atlantic League of Professional Baseball|Atlantic League]]. In {{by|2002}}, Canseco was signed by the [[Montreal Expos]] but was released prior to the regular season. Canseco retired in May 2002. He made a brief comeback attempt in {{by|2004}}, but was not offered a spot with the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] after a spring tryout.

====Awards====
His 462 career home runs rank him 32nd on [[List of top 300 Major League Baseball home run hitters|the MLB all-time list]]. Canseco was at one time the all-time leader in home runs among Latino players; he was later surpassed by [[Manny Ramirez]], [[Carlos Delgado]], [[Rafael Palmeiro]], [[Alex Rodriguez]], and [[Sammy Sosa]]. Canseco has been distinguished four times with the Silver Slugger award: three times as an AL outfielder in 1988, 1990, and 1991, and once as a Designated Hitter in 1998.

===Independent League career (2006-present)===
[[File:Jose Canseco Pitching.png|thumb|left|Typically a designated hitter, Canseco has taken to the mound as a pitcher several times with Yuma.]]
On June 29, {{by|2006}}, the independent [[Golden Baseball League]] announced Canseco had agreed to a one-year contract to play with the [[San Diego Surf Dawgs]]. The League said Canseco had agreed to be subjected to its drug-testing policy "that immediately expels any players found using steroids or illegal drugs."

On July 5, 2006, Canseco was traded to the [[Long Beach Armada]] after only one game. He requested the trade due to "family obligations." On July 31, 2006, Canseco won the Golden Baseball League's Home Run Derby. Canseco signed a short team deal with the [[Laredo Broncos]] of the [[United Baseball League]] on August 14, 2010. He served as bench coach and designated hitter.<ref name="yn11">{{Cite news|last=Carifio|first=Edward|url=http://www.yumasun.com/articles/http/11200okdate:mon-69114-11apr201105:28:00gmtserver:apache/1337%28unix%29php/525xpoweredby:php/525pragma:nocachecachecontrol:nocacheconnection:closecontenttype:text/plain;charset=iso88591canseco-team.html|title=Canseco to manage Scorpions|work=The Yuma Sun|date=April 11, 2011|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/60Nw7gObM |archivedate=July 22, 2011}}</ref> On April 11, 2011, Canseco signed a deal as a player/manager for the [[Yuma Scorpions]] of the [[North American League]].<ref name="yn11"/>

Canseco joined the [[Quintana Roo Tigres]] of the [[Mexican League]] in 2012, but was reportedly banned for using testosterone.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/early-lead/post/mexican-league-official-says-jose-canseco-admitted-using-testosterone/2012/03/08/gIQA6SpCzR_blog.html | work=The Washington Post | first=Cindy | last=Boren | title=Stats, scores and schedules | date=March 8, 2012}}</ref>

==Steroids==
In 2005, Canseco admitted to using [[anabolic steroid]]s with Jorge Delgado, Damaso Moreno and Manuel Collado in a tell-all book, ''[[Juiced: Wild Times, Rampant 'Roids, Smash Hits & How Baseball Got Big]]''. Canseco also claimed that up to 85% of major league players took steroids, a figure disputed by many in the game. In the book, Canseco specifically identified former teammates [[Mark McGwire]], [[Rafael Palmeiro]], [[Jason Giambi]], [[Iv<U+00E1>n Rodr<U+00ED>guez]] and [[Juan Gonz<U+00E1>lez (baseball)|Juan Gonz<U+00E1>lez]] as fellow steroid users, and admitted that he injected them.<ref>{{Cite news|url = http://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/2005-02-13-canseco-60minutes_x.htm|publisher = USA Today|date = 2005-02-13|title = Canseco: Steroids made baseball career possible | accessdate=May 7, 2010}}</ref> Most of the players named in the book initially denied steroid use, though Giambi admitted to steroid use in testimony before a grand jury investigating the [[Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative|BALCO]] case and on January 11, 2010, McGwire admitted publicly to using steroids.

At a Congressional hearing on the subject of steroids in sports, Palmeiro categorically denied using performance-enhancing drugs, while McGwire repeatedly and somewhat conspicuously refused to answer questions on his own suspected use, saying he "didn't want to talk about the past." Canseco's book became a [[New York Times bestseller list|''New York Times'' bestseller]]. On August 1, 2005, Palmeiro was suspended for 10 days by Major League Baseball after testing positive for steroids.

On December 13, 2007, Jos<U+00E9> Canseco and Jorge Delgado were cited in the [[Mitchell Report (baseball)|Mitchell Report]] to the Commissioner of Baseball of an Independent Investigation Into the Illegal Use of Steroids and Other Performance Enhancing Substances by Players in Major League Baseball.<ref>{{Cite news| last = Mitchell| first = George| url = http://files.mlb.com/mitchrpt.pdf| title = Mitchell Report on Steroid Use in Baseball| date = 2007-12-13| accessdate = 2007-12-13|format=PDF}}</ref> On December 20, 2007, Canseco was also named in [[Jason Grimsley]]'s unsealed affidavit as a user of steroids. Canseco and Grimsley were teammates on the 2000 New York Yankees.<ref>{{Cite news

On December 30, 2007, it was announced that Canseco has reached a deal for his sequel to ''[[Juiced: Wild Times, Rampant 'Roids, Smash Hits & How Baseball Got Big|Juiced]]''. The new book is ''[[Vindicated (book)|Vindicated]]'', which Canseco's lawyer, Robert Saunooke, said would hit bookstores by Opening Day 2008. This book is said to have "stuff" on [[Alex Rodriguez]], and [[Albert Belle]] as suggested by Canseco. The book will be a "clarification" of names that should've been mentioned in the [[Mitchell Report (baseball)|Mitchell Report]]. On January 5, 2008, a potential editor for his upcoming book, Don Yaeger, a former [[Sports Illustrated]] associate editor, said he would not edit the book. He told the [[New York Daily News]] that he thought Canseco didn't have a book in the material he gave him. However, on February 7, 2009, ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' reported that A-Rod did test positive during his 2003 season, which could make Canseco's book seem more real than it was believed.<ref>{{Cite web

However, Rodriguez denied the allegations written in Canseco's book that Canseco introduced him to a steroid deal, calling that information "100% false".

==Outside of baseball==
While still a player, he guest starred on ''[[The Simpsons]]'' and ''[[Nash Bridges]]''. Since his retirement, Canseco has appeared on ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'', ''[[60 Minutes]]'', ''The Big Idea with [[Donny Deutsch]]'', "[[Boomer and Carton]]", ''[[Howard Stern]]'', ''[[Jimmy Kimmel]] Live!'', ''CMI: The [[Chris Myers]] Interview'', and ''[[Kathy Griffin: My Life on the D-List]]''. In 2003, he was featured in the reality-TV special ''Stripper's Ball: [[Jenna Jameson]]'' with [[Dennis Rodman]] and [[Magic Johnson]].<ref>{{IMDb name|1154820}}</ref> He was a cast member in Season 5 of ''[[The Surreal Life]]'' with [[Janice Dickinson]], Pepa of [[Salt-N-Pepa]], [[Bronson Pinchot]], [[Omarosa Manigault-Stallworth]], [[Caprice Bourret]], and [[Carey Hart]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7335254|title=Jose Canseco, Omarosa join <U+2018>Surreal<U+2019> cast|publisher=MSNBC.com}}</ref>

In {{by|2007}}, he received 6 [[National Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] votes. This accounted for 1.1% of the ballots, failing to reach the 5% threshold necessary to stay on the ballot for another year. However, he can be elected to the Hall of Fame by the [[Veterans Committee|Committee of Baseball Veterans]].

In May 2008, [[Philadelphia]] [[news presenter|sportscaster]] and former [[NFL]] [[American football|football]] player [[Vai Sikahema]] accepted a challenge from Canseco to fight him for $30,000. Canseco claims to have earned black belts in [[Kung Fu]] and [[Taekwondo]], while Sikahema fought in the [[Golden Gloves]] tournament won by [[Sugar Ray Leonard]]. The fight took place on July 12 in [[Atlantic City]] at the Bernie Robbins stadium.<ref>[http://www.philly.com/dailynews/columnists/bernard_fernandez/20080527_Bernard_Fernandez] Philly.com</ref> The {{height|ft=5|in=9}} Sikahema knocked out the {{height|ft=6|in=4}} Canseco in the first round.
