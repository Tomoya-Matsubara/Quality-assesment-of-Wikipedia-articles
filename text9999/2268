'''''The Bulletin''''' is the daily newspaper of [[Bend, Oregon]], United States. ''The Bulletin'' is owned by [[Western Communications]], a family-owned corporation founded by publisher [[Robert W. Chandler]].  Over the years, a number of well known journalists have been associated with the newspaper.

==History==

To start a newspaper in Bend, a [[printing press]] and other publishing equipment items were brought overland from the railhead at [[Shaniko, Oregon|Shaniko]] by freight wagon.  The ''Bend Bulletin'' was first published as a weekly newspaper on 27 March 1903.  The newspaper<U+2019>s first publisher was Max Lueddemann with Don P. Rea serving as the first editor.  When it began, the newspaper<U+2019>s only other employee was a printer named A. H. Kennedy.  The newspaper office was located in a rustic cabin on the east bank of the [[Deschutes River (Oregon)|Deschutes River]].<ref name="PFB"/><ref name="OP"/>  In the summer of 1904, the newspaper was sold to J. M. Lawrence.  He moved the newspaper to an office building in downtown Bend.<ref name="PFB">Brogan, Phil F., ''East of the Cascades'' (Third Edition), Binford & Mort, Portland, Oregon, 1965, pp. 213<U+2013>215.</ref><ref name=ONPA>{{cite web |url= http://www.orenews.com/web/members/details.php?MemberID=7 |title= The Bulletin |publisher= Oregon Newspaper Publishers Association |accessdate= April 16, 2013}}</ref>

In 1910, [[George P. Putnam]] bought the ''Bend Bulletin'' from Lawrence.  While he was the newspaper<U+2019>s editor for only four years, Putnam continued as publisher for several more years.  During his tenure, Putnam was active in local and state politics and the newspaper began promoting [[Central Oregon]] outside the local area.  The ''Bend Bulletin'' shifted from a weekly publication to a daily newspaper on 6 December 1916.<ref name="PFB"/><ref name="OP">[http://www.orenews.com/web/members/op/OPAugust2003.pdf  "Bend Daily Celebrates Centennial"], ''Oregon Publisher'', Oregon Newspaper Publishers Association, Portland, Oregon, August 2003, pp. 6<U+2013>8.</ref>

[[Robert William Sawyer|Robert W. Sawyer]] purchased Putnam<U+2019>s interest in the newspaper in 1919.  He hired Henry Fowler, who owned a minority share in the newspaper, as editor.  Sawyer was a conservationist, who used his influence as a newspaper publisher to help preserve Oregon<U+2019>s natural resources.  In addition to publishing the ''Bend Bulletin'', he served as president of the ''National Reclamation Association'', a director of the ''American Forestry Association'', and a member of the [[Oregon Highway Commission]].  He also championed the establishment of numerous state parks as well as leading the effort to preserve key portions of the [[John Day Fossil Beds]].  Sawyer continued as publisher of the ''Bend Bulletin'' for 34 years.  In 1953, Sawyer put the newspaper up for sale.  He received offers from several large newspaper chains, but eventually sold the newspaper to Robert Chandler.  To make the purchase affordable, Sawyer only required a $6,000 down payment.<ref name="PFB"/><ref name="OP"/><ref>Lang, William L., [http://www.oregonencyclopedia.org/entry/view/sawyer_robert_1880_1959_/ "Robert Sawyer (1880<U+2013>1959)"],''The Oregon Encyclopedia'', Portland State University and the Oregon Historical Society, Portland, Oregon.

Chandler ran the newspaper for the next 43 years, first as ''The Bend Bulletin'' and after 1963 as the ''The Bulletin''.  During his tenure, Chandler brought new technology into the newspaper<U+2019>s operation.  Soon after he bought the paper, he expanded the photoengraving facilities.  In 1956, he replaced the paper<U+2019>s [[History of Printing#Flat-bed printing press|flatbed press]] with a new [[rotary press]] that printed 13,000 32-page sections per hour.  The new press also allowed the paper to print photographs in color.<ref name="OP"/><ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=eOYSAAAAIBAJ&sjid=8_cDAAAAIBAJ&pg=868,842725&dq=bend-bulletin+the-bulletin+name+change&hl=en |title= The broadening of our interests is the reason behind the change in our name |date= May 15, 1963 |publisher= ''The Bulletin'' |accessdate= 2009-10-30}}</ref>

In 1966, ''The Bulletin'' moved to a new building on Hill Street in the southern part of Bend.  As part of the move, a new [[offset press]] was installed.  The new press ended the need to produce [[Hot metal typesetting|hot-lead cast type]].  It also improved the quality of the newspaper<U+2019>s photographs.  That same year, ''The Bulletin'' began using wire service photos to supplement photograph taken by the paper<U+2019>s staff photographers.  In the 1970s, the newspaper installed video display terminals to receive electronic feeds from the wire services.  The video displays were replaced with computers a few years later.  A new Gross Urbanite offset press was installed in 1980.  This new system could print 20,000 sections an hour.<ref name="OP"/>

In 1988, three reporters were arrested for criminal trespass for attempting to get the records of hotel-motel taxes from the Deschutes County Commissioners.<ref name=arrest>Thomas, Dick. "Opening the public files", ''[[The Oregonian]]'', February 23, 1992, Forum, p. C7.</ref> The Commissioners denied access to the records and the reporters were never prosecuted.<ref name=arrest/>

In 1993, a new information systems department was added to ''The Bulletin'' organization.  In 1996, ''The Bulletin'' established its presence on the Internet by activating the ''bendbulletin.com'' domain.  This gave the newspaper its own web-site, and provided its staff with e-mail connectivity.<ref name="OP"/>

As of 2013, the newspaper's circulation is 32,455 for the Monday<U+2013>Saturday edition and 33,087 on Sunday. Currently, the publisher is Gordon Black and the editor-in-chief is John Costa.<ref name=ONPA/>

==Notable editors==

Since its founding, ''The Bulletin'' has had a number of distinguished publishers, including George P. Putnam, Robert W. Sawyer, and Robert W. Chandler.  All three of these newspapermen are honored in the ''Oregon Newspaper Hall of Fame''.  Putnam and Sawyer were inducted in 1980, shortly after the Hall of Fame was created by the [[Oregon Newspaper Publishers Association]].  Chandler was inducted in 2006.<ref>[http://www.orenews.com/About/halloffame/ ''Oregon Newspaper Hall of Fame''], Oregon Newspaper Publishers Association, Portland, Oregon.

[[Phil Brogan]] was another well known journalist associated with the ''The Bulletin''.  Brogan was hired by Sawyer in 1923.  He worked as a reporter, writer, and editor for the next 44 years, earning numerous awards for his work.  He was also a distinguished [[historian]], [[geologist]], [[paleontologist]], [[geographer]], [[meteorologist]], [[astronomer]], and outdoorsman.  In 1964, Brogan wrote ''East of the Cascades'', an important source of information on the geology, geography, and history of Central Oregon.<ref>Friedman, Ralph, ''A Touch of Oregon'', Pars Publishing Company, Portland, Oregon, 1970, pp. 110<U+2013>116.</ref><ref>United Press International, [http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ILoQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=M-IDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5074,16433&dq=phil+brogan "Phil Brogan retired editor, dead at 87"], ''Eugene Register-Guard'', Eugene, Oregon, 1 June 1983, p. 2A.</ref>  ''Phil Brogan Viewpoint'' near [[Lava Butte]] in [[Newberry National Volcanic Monument]] is named in his honor.<ref>[http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/Volcanoes/LavaButte/Locale/framework.html "Lava Lands Visitor Center"], Cascades Volcano Observatory, United States Geologic Survey, United States Department of Interior, Vancouver, Washington, 7 September 2009.</ref>
