==History==
[[File:2351617364 FitchburgDepot Boston.jpg|thumb|The [[Fitchburg Railroad]] station in [[Boston]] with the two towers]]

The tower itself, similar to a castle's battlement, was once part of the [[Boston and Maine Railroad]] Station,<ref name=Sketches>{{cite book|last=Vuilleumier|first=Marion|title=Sketches of Old Cape Cod|date=December 1, 1980|location=Cape Cod|isbn=0937338001|coauthors=Louis Vuilleumier|accessdate=31 January 2011|page=49}}</ref> later the [[Fitchburg Railroad]] Depot, in [[Boston]]. In 1850, singer [[Jenny Lind]] sang in the auditorium above the station. The concert was oversold and many people were not able to get in. Soon after, she had to cut her performance short after fans began to crash the gates.<ref name=Wicked /><ref name=Cape>{{cite news|title=The Cape's Unsung Delight|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/boston/access/42492036.html?dids=42492036:42492036&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Jun+17%2C+1999&author=&pub=Boston+Globe&desc=THE+CAPE%60S+UNSUNG+DELIGHT&pqatl=google|accessdate=25 January 2011|newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]]|date=Jun 17, 1999}}</ref> [[Phineas Taylor Barnum | P.

In 1927, the station was being torn down. Lawyer Henry M. Aldrich, who was connected with the railroad, had the tower dismantled stone by stone and transported to land in [[North Truro, Massachusetts]] that he bought one hundred acres from a local named Mort Small. Erection of the tower took more than two months and involved the labor of five men. He also erected five cottages on the land, but left no reasoning for the erection of the tower.<ref name=Wicked />

The [[Cape Cod National Seashore]] atttained the deed for the tower in 1961; it was donated by Aldrich's daughter-in-law.<ref name=Curiosities>{{cite book|last=Gellerman|first=Bruce|title=Massachusetts Curiosities: Quirky Characters, Roadside Oddities, & Other Offbeat Stuff|year=2005|publisher=Globe Pequot Press|location=Guilford, CT|isbn=0762730706|pages=264|edition=1st ed.|coauthors=Sherman, Erik|accessdate=31 January 2011|page=169}}</ref> There are no roads to the tower, although it is fairly close to a road that goes to a [[Federal Aviation Administration]] radar facility on land that is part of the old [[North Truro Air Force Station]].<ref name=Cape />

==Legend behind the name==
A common myth surrounding the naming of the tower is that on the night of her performance, [[Jenny Lind]] climbed the tower and sang to the public. While this has not been proven to be false, newspaper reports of the time do not mention any sort of performance by her to the public below. It is also rumored that Henry Aldrich was an admirer of her, hence the reason that he moved the tower to his land. The problem in that story though is that he was not born until seventeen years after the incident. In "A Pilgrim Returns to Cape Cod", Edward Snow made the myth more attractive by stating, "There are those who like to believe", that because an Aldrich family member was captivated by Jenny's voice, this caused them to decide to move the tower to their land in [[Truro, Massachusetts]]. He went on to undermine the myth by stating that Aldrich's son, later told him that Lind's performance did not motivate his father to move the tower to his land on the Cape. It is because of this myth that the legend of the tower lives on in local lore.<ref name=Wicked />
