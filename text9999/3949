'''State Highway 8''' or '''SH 8''' is a north&ndash;south state highway that runs from the [[Red River (Mississippi watershed)|Red River]], the [[Texas]]-[[Arkansas]] boundary, north of [[New Boston, Texas|New Boston]] to [[State Highway 155 (Texas)|SH 155]] at [[Linden, Texas|Linden]].

==History==

[[Image:Old Texas 8.svg|50px|Historic SH 8|left]]'''SH 8''' was one of the original twenty six state highways proposed in [[1917]], proposed as an 'East Texas Highway.'  In [[1919]] the routing follows the present day '''SH 8''' from the [[Arkansas]] State Line to its terminus in [[Linden, Texas|Linden]], then continued south on present day [[U.S. Highway 59 (Texas)|U.S. Highway 59]] through [[Marshall, Texas|Marshall]], to [[Carthage, Texas|Carthage]].  On [[U.S. Highway 96 (Texas)|U.S. Highway 96]], '''SH 8''' traveled through [[San Augustine, Texas|San Augustine]], [[Jasper, Texas|Jasper]] to its junction with [[State Highway 62 (Texas)|SH 62]], where it turned towards its terminus in [[Orange, Texas|Orange]].

In [[1922]] '''SH 8''' was rerouted from [[Buna, TX|Buna]] to [[Beaumont, Texas|Beaumont]] and into [[Port Arthur, Texas|Port Arthur]] via present day US 96.  The Buna-Orange section became State Highway 62 by 1932.

In [[1926]], US 59 and 96 were overlaid over pieces of '''SH 8'''.  While the entirety of the '''SH 8''' maintained its number, by [[1939]] most of '''SH 8''' was cancelled, leaving only the Arkansas-[[Corley, TX|Corley]] segment to the old highway.  In [[1947]] a small segment was reassigned back to SH 8 from US 59 from Corley to Linden when US 59 was rerouted further east.

SH 8 was rerouted around the western side of Linden in 1964, with the old route becoming [[Farm to Market Road 125|FM 125]].

[[Image:TexasHistSH8A.png|50px|Historic SH 8A|left]] '''SH 8A''' was an alternate routing added just east of '''SH 8''' from [[Center, Texas|Center]] to [[Orange, Texas|Orange]] in 1919. By 1933, it had been renumbered as '''SH 21''' and '''SH 87'''.

==Route description==

SH 8 begins on the south side of the city on [[Linden, Texas|Linden]] at an intersection with SH 155, less than a quarter of a mile west of its intersection with US Route 59.  The highway travels north through northern Cass County, crossing over Wright Patman Lake into Bowie County.  The highway briefly turns west with US Route 67 when they intersect in [[Maud, Texas|Maud]].  The route then turns back north, running along the western edge of the Red River Army Depot.  It then passes through the city of [[New Boston, Texas|New Boston]] and intersects Interstate 30.  The route then continues north, crossing the Red River, and the Arkansas State Line, where it becomes [[Highway 41 (Arkansas)|Arkansas Highway 41]].
