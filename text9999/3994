'''Tunbridge Wells railway station''' serves [[Royal Tunbridge Wells|Tunbridge Wells]] in [[Kent]], in [[England]]. The station and all trains serving it are currently operated by [[Southeastern (train operating company)|Southeastern]]. It is located directly on the double-tracked [[Railway electrification in Great Britain|electrified]] [[Hastings Line]].

The station is located in an open cut, and the railway line enters tunnels in both directions. The ticket office and platform 1 (generally used by northbound trains) can be accessed directly from street level on the west side of the station or by a footbridge from the east side; platform 2 (generally used by southbound trains) is accessible only by stairs - there is a gate at the south end of platform 2 giving step-free access which is usually kept locked but which station staff will open on request for those who need it. Both platforms are signalled for reversible working - trains can arrive/depart at either platform in either direction. 

Just beyond the tunnel at the south end of the station was Grove Junction, where trains took the single line branch to [[Tunbridge Wells West railway station|Tunbridge Wells West]]. The branch closed on 6 July 1985. Before the closure of the branch, the station was called '''Tunbridge Wells Central'''.
