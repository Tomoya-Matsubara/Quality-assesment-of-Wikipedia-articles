The '''[[Papal conclave]] of 1963''' was convoked following the death of [[Pope John XXIII]] on June 3 of that same year in the [[Apostolic Palace]]. After the [[Cardinal electors in Papal conclave, 1963|cardinal electors]] assembled in [[Rome]], the conclave to elect John's successor began on June 19 and ended two days later, on June 21, after six ballots. The [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]] elected [[Pope Paul VI|Giovanni Battista Montini]], then [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Milan|Archbishop of Milan]], as the new [[pope]]. He accepted the election and took the [[Regnal name|pontifical name]] of ''Paul VI''.

==Background==
John XXIII's death left the future of the [[Second Vatican Council]] in the balance, as the election of an anti-Council pope could have severely curbed the Council's role. The leading ''[[papabile]]'' candidates were [[Pope Paul VI|Giovanni Battista Montini]] of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Milan|Milan]], who had not yet been Cardinal at the time of the previous conclave and was supportive of reforms proposed at the Council, and [[Giuseppe Siri]] of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Genoa|Genoa]], ''[[papabile]]'' in 1958 and critical these reforms. Reportedly, John XXIII had sent oblique signals indicating that he thought Montini would make a fine pope.

==Election==

The 1963 conclave, which was held from June 19 to June 21, at the [[Sistine Chapel]] in [[Vatican City]], was the largest ever assembled until that time. There were eighty-two cardinals, but owing to his [[house arrest]], [[J<U+00F3>zsef Mindszenty]] could not travel to Rome, while [[Carlos Mar<U+00ED>a de la Torre]] did not participate owing to his advanced age and chronic health problems. Of the [[Cardinal electors in Papal conclave, 1963|eighty cardinals who did participate]], eight had been elevated by [[Pope Pius XI]], twenty-seven by Pius XII, and the remainder by John XXIII. Each cardinal elector was allowed one aide.

About the earlier ballots, various rumours persist: some allege that reform-minded cardinals initially voted for [[Leo Joseph Suenens]] of [[Archbishopric of Mechelen-Brussel|Mechelen-Brussels]] and [[Franz K<U+00F6>nig]] of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Vienna|Vienna]], to remind the electors that the pope does not have to be [[Italian people|Italian]]{{fact|date=November 2011}}, while others report that conservative cardinals attempted to block Montini's election in the early balloting. ([[Gustavo Testa]], an old friend of John XXIII, had subsequently lost his temper in the Chapel and demanded that the intransigents stop impeding Montini<U+2019>s path.){{fact|date=November 2011}} In a versikon of the [[Siri thesis]], some claim that Cardinal Siri received the two-thirds required for a valid election but eventually refused the office, allegedly under pressure. When asked two decades later whether in both the 1958 and 1963 conclaves he had initially been elected as pontiff, Siri is reported to have responded "I am bound by the secret. This secret is horrible. I would have books to write about the different conclaves. Very serious things have taken place. But I can say nothing."{{ref|Siri}} However, it is worthy of note that Siri fully submitted to the authority of John XXIII, Paul VI, [[Pope John Paul I|John Paul I]], and [[Pope John Paul II|John Paul II]].

The favourite candidate, Giovanni Battista Montini, was elected after only six ballots. By the fourth ballot on June 20, according to [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' Magazine]], the Milanese archbishop only needed 4 additional votes to obtain the required number of votes.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} When officially asked by [[Eug<U+00E8>ne-Gabriel-Gervais-Laurent Tisserant]] if he accepted his election, Montini replied, ''Accepto, in nomine Domini'' ("I accept, in the name of the Lord") and choose to be known as [[Pope Paul VI]].

At 11:22 a.m., white smoke rose from the chimney of the Sistine Chapel, signifying the successful election of a new pope. [[Alfredo Ottaviani]], in his capacity as the [[Protodeacon|senior Cardinal Deacon]], [[Habemus Papam|announced]] Montini's election in the traditional [[Latin]]; before Ottaviani had even finished saying Montini's name, the crowd beneath the balcony of [[St. Peter's Basilica]] erupted into applause.
