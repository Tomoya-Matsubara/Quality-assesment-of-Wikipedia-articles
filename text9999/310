'''Sir Richard Richards''' [[Serjeant-at-law|SL]] (5 November 1752 &ndash; 11 November 1823) was a [[Wales|Welsh]] politician and judge. He was [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Helston (UK Parliament constituency)|Helston]] on two occasions, but only made one speech in Parliament.  He was later a successful chancery barrister, eventually becoming [[Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer]].

==Life==
Richards was born on 5 November 1752 at Coed, [[Brithdir, Gwynedd|Brithdir]], near [[Dolgellau]] in [[Merionethshire]].  He was the eldest son of Thomas Richards and his wife, Catherine, whose brother (William Parry) was warden of [[Ruthin]], [[Denbighshire]]. His grandfather, also called William Parry, was headmaster of [[Ruthin School]] and Richards was educated there.  Richards then progressed to [[Oxford University]], [[matriculation|matriculating]] as a member of [[Jesus College, Oxford]] on 19 March 1771.<ref name=Oxford/>  He transferred to [[Wadham College, Oxford]] on 7 May 1773 and obtained his [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree on 10 October 1774.  He then became a scholar at [[The Queen's College, Oxford]], and after being appointed to a [[Oxbridge Fellow|fellowship]] at Queen's on 17 December 1774, he was awarded his [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|Master of Arts]] degree on 15 July 1777.  In the meantime, Richards had become a member of the [[Inner Temple]] (being admitted on 10 May 1775) and he was [[called to the bar]] on 12 February 1780.<ref name=Oxford>{{cite web| first=G. F.

He was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in February 1793 as a "''Gentleman studious in Natural History''".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www2.royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp=Archive&dsqCmd=Show.tcl&dsqDb=Persons&dsqPos=4&dsqSearch=%28Surname%3D%27richards%27%29|title = Library and Archive catalogue|publisher=The Royal Society|accessdate= 5 October 2010}}</ref>

==Political career==
In the [[British general election, 1796|1796 general election]], Richards was elected as one of the [[Members of Parliament]] for the [[Helston (UK Parliament constituency)|constituency of Helston]], [[Cornwall]].  He held the seat until March 1799, when he resigned in favour of [[Francis Osborne, 1st Baron Godolphin|Lord Francis Osborne]], son of the [[Francis Osborne, 5th Duke of Leeds|Duke of Leeds]] who controlled the seat.  He was re-elected at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1807|May 1807 general election]], resigning on 29 July 1807 in favour of [[James Blackwood, 2nd Baron Dufferin and Claneboye|Sir James Blackwood]].  During his parliamentary career, he supported the ministry of [[William Pitt the Younger]] but made only one reported speech, opposing the Quakers' Relief Bill on 24 February 1797 as unnecessary and inconvenient.<ref name=Oxford/>

==Legal career==
Richards' main area of practice was in the [[Court of Chancery]]. He was one of the three registrars to the [[Prerogative Court]] of the [[Province of Canterbury]] from 1788 to 1800, and was appointed counsel to [[Queen Anne's Bounty]] in 1789. He became solicitor-general to [[Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz|Queen Charlotte]] (the wife of [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]]) in 1794, becoming attorney-general to the queen in 1801 in succession to [[William Grant (British politician)|William Grant]]. He was appointed as a [[Bencher]] of Inner Temple in 1799, and held the positions of Reader (1804) and [[Treasurer#In the Inns of Court|Treasurer]] (1806).<ref name=Oxford/>

He was a potential appointee to the newly-created position of [[Chancellor of the High Court|Vice-Chancellor of the Court of Chancery]] in 1812, since he was the senior chancery barrister who was not an MP, earning <U+00A3>7,000 per year.  He was led to believe by his friend [[John Scott, 1st Earl of Eldon|Lord Eldon]], the [[Lord Chancellor]], that he would be appointed.  However, Eldon instead bowed to party-political pressure and appointed the [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General]], [[Thomas Plumer]], to the new post. Richards was indignant, although he was appeased by his appointment as [[Chief Justice of Chester|chief justice]] of the [[county palatine]] of [[Cheshire|Chester]]. He resigned that position when he was offered a position of [[Exchequer of pleas|Baron of the Exchequer]] in February 1814.  He had refused this appointment in 1807, but he was now given to understand that he would in due course succeed as [[Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer|Chief Baron]]. The offer was apparently made when Lord Eldon tossed a note into court addressed to "[[Taffy was a Welshman|Taffy]]".<ref name=Oxford/> Richards was appointed a [[Serjeant-at-law]] on 26 February 1814 and was knighted by the [[George IV of the United Kingdom|Prince Regent]] at [[Carlton House, London|Carlton House]] on 11 May 1814. On the death of [[Alexander Thomson (judge)|Sir Alexander Thomson]], Richards became Chief Baron on 21 April 1817 and became a [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|Privy Counsellor]] five days later. He helped clear the backlog of equity appeals and was regarded as a sound and capable judge.  He presided over the trials of [[Jeremiah Brandreth]], convicted of treason, and two of the [[Cato Street Conspiracy|Cato Street conspirators]].  He also acted as [[Lord Speaker]] when Lord Eldon was ill in January 1819.<ref name=Oxford/>

==Family==
Richards married Catherine Humphreys, through whom Richards acquired an estate in [[Caerynwch]], Merionethshire; he later became a [[Deputy Lieutenant]] of Merionethshire. He had eight sons and two daughters, and was known as "Stumpy Dick".  His eldest son [[Richard Richards (1787-1860)|Richard Richards]] (known as "Double Dick") was MP for the [[Merioneth (UK Parliament constituency)|constituency of Merioneth]] from 1836 to 1852. Robert Richards and Griffith Richards (the third and sixth sons) were both appointed [[Queen's Counsel]] and both, like their father, became benchers of Inner Temple, as did a grandson and a great-grandson of Sir Richard Richards.  Richards died on 11 November 1823 and was buried in the Inner Temple vault; his wife was buried there also on 12 October 1825.<ref name=Oxford/>
