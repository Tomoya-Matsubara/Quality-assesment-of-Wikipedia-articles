'''Bradley Edwin "Brad" Guzan''' {{IPAc-en|<U+02C8>|g|u<U+02D0>|z|<U+0259>n}} (born September 9, 1984) is an American [[Association football|soccer]] player who plays as a [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] for English [[Premier League]] club [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] and the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States national team]].

==Club career==

===Early career===
Born in [[Evergreen Park, Illinois|Evergreen Park]], [[Illinois]], Guzan, who is of [[Polish-American]] ancestry, played his youth soccer at the Chicago Magic Soccer Club, and for the varsity soccer team at [[Providence Catholic High School]] in Illinois, from which he graduated in 2003. He went on to play two seasons in [[college soccer|NCAA]] competition as a member of the [[South Carolina Gamecocks men's soccer]] team, where he was a second-team [[All-American]] in his sophomore season.<ref>{{Cite news| title=Chivas USA picks GK Brad Guzan <U+2013> MLS SuperDraft 2005 | url=http://www.oursportscentral.com/services/releases/?id=3117115 | publisher=OurSportsCentral | date=January 5, 2005}}</ref>

=== Chivas USA ===
After spending two years with the [[Chicago Fire Reserves]] in the [[USL Premier Development League]] he chose to forgo the rest of his college years, signing a [[Generation Adidas]] contract with [[Major League Soccer]] (MLS). [[C.D. Chivas USA|Chivas USA]] drafted Guzan with the second overall pick of the [[2005 MLS SuperDraft]].

Guzan has played for the Under-18 [[United States men's national soccer team|United States national team]]. He got his first cap for the senior national team on February 19, 2006, against [[Guatemala national football team|Guatemala]]. On November 7, 2007, Guzan was named [[MLS Goalkeeper of the Year]].<ref>{{Cite news| title=Chivas USA's Guzan wins top goalkeeper | url=http://msn.foxsports.com/other/story/7395318 | accessdate=November 7, 2007}}</ref>

===Aston Villa===
July 11, 2008, [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] agreed a transfer fee in the region of <U+00A3>600,000, or $1 million, with MLS and Chivas USA to sign Guzan, significantly less than the <U+00A3>2 million agreed to in Aston Villa's failed move for the keeper in January 2008. This was because Guzan would have been out of his contract at the end of the [[2008 Major League Soccer season|2008 season]] in November, allowing him to sign for Aston Villa during the January transfer window on a free transfer.

On August 1, 2008, Guzan was granted a [[Work permit (United Kingdom)|work permit]] by the [[Home Office]], allowing him to complete his move to Aston Villa.<ref name=villa-move-final>{{Cite news| last=Michaels | first=Steve | title=Villa Given Guzan Work Permit | url=http://www.goal.com/en/Articolo.aspx?ContenutoId=800793 | publisher=[[Goal.com]] | date=August 1, 2008 | accessdate=August 1, 2008}}</ref> He was due to be officially introduced by Aston Villa after competing for the United States at the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in [[Beijing]]. Guzan was the second American goalkeeper called Brad to be signed during the summer by Villa, following the capture of Premier League veteran [[Brad Friedel]].

Guzan made his Villa debut in September 2008, in the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]], at home to [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]].

He made his European debut in the [[UEFA Cup]] game away at [[Slavia Prague]] on November 6, 2008. The match finished 1<U+2013>0 to [[Aston Villa]] with Guzan making several saves to keep a clean sheet. His performance led to his manager, [[Martin O'Neill]], describing him as a "class goalkeeper in the making." He also started in Villa's first leg against CSKA Moscow in round 32 of the UEFA Cup at Villa Park on February 18, 2009, and came on as a substitute against Liverpool after [[Brad Friedel]]'s red card.

Guzan played in every game that Villa won during their success in the [[2009 Peace Cup]], against [[Atlante F.C.|Atlante]], [[FC Porto|Porto]] and [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]]. He helped Villa overcome the Italians in the [[2009 Peace Cup#Final|final]], notably in the penalty shootout where he saved the attempts of [[Vincenzo Iaquinta]] and [[Alessandro Del Piero]].<ref>http://www.avfc.co.uk/page/News/0,,10265~1741264,00.html</ref> The only game that Villa did not win (in the [[2009 Peace Cup#Group C|group stages]] against [[M<U+00E1>laga CF|M<U+00E1>laga]]) was the one in which Guzan did not feature.
Despite having a successful pre-season period, Guzan was dropped from the first team in favour of compatriot and Premier League veteran [[Brad Friedel]] for Villa's opening game of the 2009<U+2013>10 season, against [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]].

On October 27, 2009, Guzan saved four penalties in one match, one in normal time and three more in a penalty shoot-out win over [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] at the [[Stadium of Light]] in the last 16 of the League Cup. Despite these heroics, [[Brad Friedel]] replaced him in goal for the final against Manchester United.<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/league_cup/8531179.stm | publisher=BBC Sport | title=Aston Villa 1<U+2013>2 Man Utd | date=February 28, 2010 | accessdate=April 26, 2010 | first=Phil | last=McNulty}}</ref>

====Return to Villa====

On December 3, 2011, Guzan made his second [[Premier League]] appearance for Villa coming on for the injured [[Shay Given]] against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]. Given had been ruled out for a month with a torn hamstring so Guzan retained his place in the first team, giving him an extended run in Aston Villa's first team.

Guzan was released by Villa at the end of his contract in June 2012.<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://www.avfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10265~2786007,00.html | publisher=Aston Villa F.C. | title=Senior trio Guzan, Heskey and Cuellar head Villa released list. | date=May 23, 2012 | accessdate=May 23, 2012 }}</ref> However, he was linked with a return to the club over the summer in a situation similar to that of fellow Aston Villa goalkeeper [[Andy Marshall]] in 2010. On July 16, 2012, Guzan was included in new manager [[Paul Lambert]]'s 25-man squad for Villa's tour of the United States and the same day, the player confirmed via [[Twitter]] that he had renewed his contract and rejoined the club.<ref name="USA Tour: Confirmed Villa party set for flight">{{cite web |url=http://www.avfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10265~2850585,00.html |title=USA Tour: Confirmed Villa party set for flight |work=Aston Villa Football Club | publisher=AVFC |date=July 16, 2012 }}</ref><ref name="Guzan confirms return on Twitter">{{cite web |url=https://twitter.com/bguzan/status/224826305231851520 |title=Twitter / bguzan: Excited to be going back to villa and what the future holds!

He made his return for Aston Villa against [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] putting in a Man of the Match performance in a 1<U+2013>1 draw at the [[St James' Park]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Nursey |first=James |url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/brad-guzan-is-determined-to-keep-shay-1300937 |title=Brad Guzan is determined to keep Shay Given out of the Aston Villa team |publisher=Mirror.co.uk |date=September 3, 2012 |accessdate=June 13, 2013}}</ref> He kept Villa's first clean sheet of the season in a 2<U+2013>0 win against [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] and performed well enough to keep his position in the starting lineup. At the end of the 2012-13 Premier League season, he was voted the Aston Villa Player of the Year thanks to his large contribution to Villa's survival.<ref>{{cite web|last=Creditor |first=Avi |url=http://sports.yahoo.com/news/guzan-named-aston-villas-player-224200990--sow.html |title=Guzan named Aston Villa's Player of the Year |publisher=Sports.yahoo.com |date=May 7, 2013 |accessdate=June 13, 2013}}</ref>  On July 6, 2013, Guzan was rewarded for his play and signed a four-year contract extension with the Midlands club.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11677/8810435/Aston-Villa-goalkeeper-Brad-Guzan-signs-new-four-year-deal |title=Aston Villa goalkeeper Brad Guzan signs new four-year deal |publisher=Sky Sports |date=July 6, 2013 |accessdate=July 6, 2013 }}</ref>

On July 18, 2013, Guzan stated that he hoped to give Aston Villa the best years of his career and said that signing a new contract was a "no-brainer".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.avfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10265~3263179,00.html | publisher=Aston Villa F.C. | title=Guzan: I'm delighted to be giving Villa the best years of my career | date=July 18, 2013 | accessdate=July 18, 2013}}</ref>

On 28 September 2013, Guzan remarkably got an assist for [[Andreas Weimann]] in a 3-2 win against [[Manchester City]] in which Paul Lambert praised Guzan's distribution technique for goal kicks.

==International career==
[[File:Landon Donovan and Brad Guzan.jpg|thumb|200px|Guzan (right) with the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States national team]] at the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]]]]
Since 2006, Guzan has established himself as the second-choice goalkeeper for the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States national team]] behind [[Tim Howard]]. He made his World Cup qualifying debut in the second leg of a [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification <U+2013> CONCACAF Second Round|second round]] qualifier against [[Barbados national football team|Barbados]] (with the US up 8<U+2013>0 and having all but secured advancement). He later started in two [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification <U+2013> CONCACAF Third Round|semifinal]] matches after the U.S. had secured advancement to the final round<U+2014>a 2<U+2013>1 loss at [[Trinidad and Tobago national football team|Trinidad and Tobago]] and a 2<U+2013>0 win over [[Guatemala national football team|Guatemala]]. When Howard was suspended for a match at [[El Salvador national football team|El Salvador]] due to accumulated yellow cards, Guzan started and helped earn a critical 2<U+2013>2 draw. Guzan also started the USA's 3<U+2013>0 win over [[Egypt national football team|Egypt]] in the [[2009 Confederations Cup]]. On May 11, 2010, Guzan was named to the U.S. national team's provisional 30-man World Cup roster.

Since then, Guzan has sat back as a second choice to keeper Tim Howard. While Howard was recovering from a back injury, Guzan started in two World Cup qualifier matches in the [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification - CONCACAF Fourth Round|fourth round]] in March 2013. He did not allow a goal during either match, picking up a 1-0 win over [[Costa Rica national football team|Costa Rica]] at [[Dick's Sporting Goods Park]] and an historic 0-0 draw against [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] at [[Estadio Azteca]].
