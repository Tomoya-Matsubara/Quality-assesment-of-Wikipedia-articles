The '''Russian-Circassian War''' is the name given to the period of hostilities between the [[Russian Empire]] and the inhabitants of [[Circassia]] during the Russian invasion and occupation of the Circassian region. Circassia, (also known as '''Cherkessia''' in Russian) was a region in [[Caucasia]] which comprised of the coastline and most of the interior of the current territory of [[Krasnodar Krai]] and [[Adygea]].<ref name="UNPOP1">[http://www.unpo.org/member_profile.php?id=18 Circassia], Unrepresented Nations and People Organisation (UNPO) ([[1994-04-16]]).  Retrieved on [[April 4]] [[2007]]</ref> The historical region, now mainly [[North Ossetia-Alania]], was named after the traditional inhabitants, the [[Circassians]], [[Adyghe people|Adyghe]] or Adiga, along with a number of smaller ethnic groups and tribes.<ref>Mackie p.1</ref> The Russian-Circassian conflict began with the initial arrival of Russian occupation forces in 1763, and ended with the signing of several Russian loyalty oaths by Circassian leaders on [[June 2]] [[1864]] ([[May 21]], [[O.S.]]). 

While the Russian-Circassian War began as an isolated conflict, Russian expansion through the entire region soon brought it into conflict with a number of other nations in what later became known as the [[Caucasian War]], and of which the Russian-Circassian War became a part. Both came to an end with the signing of the loyalty oaths to Russia, and with the total occupation of the region by Russian forces, which involved the forced expulsion of millions of indigenous Circassians to areas of the [[Ottoman Empire]], [[Turkey]], [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]], [[Jordan]] and [[Kosovo]],<ref name="UNPOP1"/>  with some historians citing that up to 4,000,000 civilians perished as a result of the exodus. 

==Previous hostilities==

The date of the outbreak of the Russian-Circassian conflict is difficult to define,<ref name="multiple"/><ref>Mackie p.11</ref> as the earliest recorded hostilities between Russia and the Circassians began in [[985]] when Russian forces under [[Sviatoslav II of Kiev|Prince Sviatoslav]], invaded the region.<ref name="multiple"/> The date of the outbreak of the Russian-Circassian War is thus debated by a number of [[historian]]s.<ref name="UNPOP1"/> Despite the long lasting hostilities, historians such as A. A. Gaspari in 1904 have argued that the conflict began in 1817 with the arrival of Russian General [[Aleksey Petrovich Yermolov]],<ref name="multiple">Natho, Kadir. [http://www.circassianworld.com/russo_circassian_war.html Russian-Circassian War.] Circassianworld.com (2005).  Retrieved on [[March 11]] [[2007]]</ref> who took command of the Russian forces occupying the whole region of the Caucasus. This start date is the same as that of the larger Caucasian War. A greater number of historians, however, agree that the conflict with Circassia alone began in 1763 with the arrival of Russian occupation forces in the Circassian region itself.<ref name="multiple"/><ref>Baddeley, preface</ref>

Following the invasion under Prince Sviatoslav, hostilities again broke out in 1022, when [[Mstislav of Chernigov|Prince Mstislav]] of the Princedom of [[Tamatarkha]] invaded Circassian Kasogia. In 1561, [[Ivan IV of Russia]], through marriage, brought the Eastern Circassia territory under his control and constructed a series of [[Cossack]] forts, at Tumen, Sunja, and Andreevo, which were completed by 1579. Although Ivan also annexed several other territories, including [[Siberia]], his successor Tsar [[Feodor I of Russia]] gave himself the title <U+201C>The ruler of the Iberian land, Georgian Tsars, Kabarda, Circassians, and mountaineer princes.<U+201D><ref name="multiple"/> illustrating Russian control over the entire Circassian region. [[May 13]], [[1711]] saw another Russian invasion of Circassia under the command of Araksin, Governor of Astrakhan, who was in turn under the orders of Tsar [[Peter I of Russia|Peter Alexeyevich Romanov]], or <U+201C>Peter the Great<U+201D>. 30,000 Russian soldiers captured towns and pillaged villages for 86 km along the [[Kuban River]] in Circassia.<ref>Hatk, Isam ''Journal "Al-Waha"-"Oasis", Amman'' 1992</ref> Circassian cavalry, 7,000 strong, were defeated by the invasion forces on [[September 6]]. This style of conflict continued from 1716 to 1763, with 43,247 Circassians, 39,200 horses, 190,000 cattle, and 227,000 sheep being killed or driven away.<ref name="multiple"/><ref name="UNPOP1"/>

==Opportunity for Russia==
[[Image:Aivaz theodosia.jpg|thumb|right|Painting of the Russian fleet that was constructed in the ports along the Black Sea conquered during the conflict]]

The Circassian region was a key strategic location amidst the power struggle between the emerging Russian Empire, established [[England]] and [[France]], and the failing [[Ottoman Empire]] during the mid [[18th Century]]. Russia had set her sights on expansion along the [[Black Sea]], while England and France sought to reduce Russia<U+2019>s ability to take advantage of the declining Ottoman Empire, a foreign policy known as the answer to the [[Eastern Question]]. 

Peter the Great<U+2019>s plans for expansion into [[India]] and the Black Sea included engaging both the [[Turkey|Turks]] and [[Persia]], the latter in particular in order to open trade routes to [[Syria]]. To facilitate the fall of Persia, Russia would require shipyards on the Black Sea, which made Circassia, with its coastline, a target. Having taken that coastline, as well as [[Bosphorus]] and the [[Dardanelles]], Russia hoped to cripple the Ottoman Empire as well as the trading interests of Great Britain. 

Tsar [[Alexander II]] was told by his advisors that:

{{cquote|The East must belong to us by right. We should not relax our activities in that direction for one moment. Constantinople has no knowledge of our real intentions. Having taken possession of it, we shall acquire the most important point of the world, and these gates to Asia should forever remain in our hands. Britain is the mistress of the seas since time immemorial. Leaning on the might we have achieved on land, we must have the same on the sea. We must take over the Black Sea coast, Bosphorus, and Dardanelles. The Black Sea ought to become the place for our manoeuvres... It is imperative to complete the war with the peoples of the Caucasus, which will still demand substantial expenses and a great perseverance.<ref name="multiple"/>}}

==Events of the war==

The Russian-Circassian war lasted 101 years, and was divided into three chronological periods based on the military activities of the Russian occupation forces. The Circassia of the time was divided into two geographic and ethnic regions, both occupied by a large number of peaceful tribes and ruled by royal aristocracies. Eastern Circassia, also known as [[Kabard|Kabardia]], was inhabited by the Kabardians, a semi-nomadic eastern branch of what was once the [[Adyghe]] tribal fellowship that was the ethnic root of the majority of the Circassian population as a whole.<ref name="UNPOP1"/> The first period of the conflict was concerned with the invasion and subjugation of this region, and took place from 1763 onwards. During the second period of the conflict, between the occupation of eastern Circassia and the year of 1822, Russian armies periodically raided western Circassia and forcibly relocated many inhabitants. During the third period from 1822 onwards, the Russian army invaded and occupied western Circassia and eventually procured the loyalty of the tribes settling there.<ref name="multiple"/>

===Occupation of eastern Circassia===

In 1763, Russian forces in the Russian-occupied eastern fringes of Circassia began fortifying towns, to which the inhabitants objected. On [[August 21]] [[1765]], the citizens of Circassia were instructed by Russian General De-Medem, to accept Russian control or face the Russian army.<ref name="multiple"/> 
[[Image:Georgianroad.jpg|thumb|left|270px|Construction of the [[Georgian Military Road]] through disputed territories was a key factor in the eventual Russian success]]

With hostilities growing throughout the period, Russia dispatched several military expeditions, starting in 1779 under the command of General Yakobi. Kabardia, near the Balka River, was attacked on [[September 29]] [[1779]], by Russian forces under the command of General Yakobi, and taken with the loss of the Kabardian defenders as well as 2,000 horses, 5,000 cattle, and 5,000 sheep.<ref name="multiple"/> On a number of occasions, the Russian army took advantage of unrest and difficulty both within and between the different Circassian tribes,<ref>Baddeley p.123</ref> illustrated on [[22 June]] [[1806]] when the town of Derbend fell to the Russian forces without a shot being fired. The ruler of Derbend, Shaykh Ali, was so unpopular with his people that upon the arrival of the Russian army, they revolted and allowed the Russians to take over.<ref>Baddeley p.74</ref> In 1804, the subjugated Kabardians, as well as the remaining Western Circassians and neighbouring Balkars, Karachays, [[Abazins]], Ossetins, Ingushs, and [[Chechens]], united in a military uprising.<ref name="UNPOP1"/> The rebels demanded the destruction of the Kislovodsk Russian fort and of the Cordon line. This was one of three defensive lines, all of which consisted of chains of forts, which were built during the whole conflict: the Caucasian line in 1780, the Chernomorski Cord line in 1793, and the Sunja line in 1817. With the refusal of these demands, and despite threats of bloodshed from Russian commander General Tsitsianov, the rebel forces began threatening the Kislovodsk fort.<ref>Baddeley p.92</ref>

Russian forces commanded by General Glazenap were pushed back to Georgievsk and then put under siege there, however the attacking Kabardian forces were eventually pushed back, and 80 Kabardian villages were torched as a reprisal.<ref name="multiple"/> In October 1809, rebel forces attacked the Caucasian Line. Between 1809 and 1810, Russian reinforcements began arresting Kabardian princes for resisting colonial rule, which led to some resistance forces abandoning the war, and many of the princes submitting to Russian control. Later in 1810, a Russian army under General Bulgakov destroyed 200 Circassian and Balkar villages and drove away 20,000 cattle.<ref>Baddeley p.73</ref>
[[Image:ermoloff.jpg|thumb|right|Aleksey Yermolov]]
In 1811, petitions were sent to [[St. Petersburg]] in Russia, appealing for the rights of Kabardian aristocracy in the occupied areas. While many other points were agreed, requests for the return of land occupied by Russian fortresses was deliberated over. Russia encouraged the loyalty of subjugated Kabardian nobles with donations to the Circassian government, and honorary military ranks for the aristocracy in the Russian army. Meanwhile, on the military front, Russian forces in the Circassian region were united under the newly organised Caucasian corps in 1816 under the command of newly arrived General Aleksey Yermolov. A year later, in May 1818, the village of Tramov was surrounded, burnt, and its inhabitants slaughtered by Russian forces under the command of General Delpotso, who took orders from Yermolov and who then wrote to the rebel forces: <U+201C><U+201C>This time, I am limiting myself on this. In the future, I will have no mercy for the guilty brigands; their villages will be destroyed, properties taken, wives and children will be slaughtered."<ref name="multiple"/> The Russians also constructed several more fortifications during that year. During the whole period from 1779 to 1818, 315,000 of the 350,000 Kabardinians had reportedly been killed by the Russian armies.<ref name="multiple"/>

===Forays into western Circassia===

Minor Kabardia, or western Circassia, was targeted for a new offensive by General Stal, who was given command of the Caucasian Line in 1819. In September 1820, Stal and his forces began to forcibly resettle inhabitants of western Circassia. Throughout the conflict, Russia had employed a tactic of divide and rule,<ref>Henze, Paul B. ''The North Caucasus Barrier: The Russian Advance Towards The Muslim World''</ref> and following this, Yermolov instructed Stal on [[July 1]] [[1821]] to encourage the Ingushs and Taugur tribes, who had previously been subjugated by the Circassians, to rise up and join the Russian efforts.<ref name="multiple"/> Military forces were sent into Kabardia, killing cattle and displacing large numbers of inhabitants into the mountains, with the land these inhabitants had once lived on being acquired for the Cossacks. Throughout that year, Kabardia was subject to further pillaging, with the entirety of Kabardia (eastern Circassia) being declared as property of the Russian government.<ref>Baddeley p.135</ref>
[[Image:Caucwar.jpg|thumb|right|270px|''A Scene from the Caucasian War'', by [[Franz Roubaud]] (1856<U+2013>1928)]]

Yermolov accelerated his efforts, with the month of March 1822 alone seeing fourteen Kabardian villages being displaced as Yermolov led expeditions into western Circassia.<ref name="multiple"/> The construction of new defensive lines in Kabardia led to renewed uprisings, which were eventually crushed and the rebellious lords had their much needed peasant work forces freed by the Russian forces. Circassia was placed under Russian military rule in 1822, with the nobility being forced to carry out the orders of Russian generals and with a Temporary Kabardian Court also being established. In 1827, further petitions were submitted to the Russian government appealing against this.

Yermolov, together with lieutenant-colonel Kotsarev, Colonel Pobednov, and General Stal, launched a renewed offensive into western Circassia in the spring of 1822, where they <U+201C>spread a great horror<U+201D> as Yermolov recorded.<ref name="multiple"/> In a letter of [[April 29]] [[1822]] he wrote:

{{cquote|The Kabardinians are playing dirty tricks on [us in] inciting... beyond the Kubans [Circassians], who are coming in groups to help them and are attacking the Line. I intend to teach them quite well.<ref name="multiple"/>}}

===Invasion of western Circassia===

While eastern Circassia was being occupied, Russia was also engaged in a [[Russo-Turkish War (1806<U+2013>1812)|war with the Turks]] in order to free Black Sea coastline from Turkish control, and sporadic wars had also flared up with other neighbours, including the Chechens. In western Circassia, which Russia had previously been merely foraying into, a number of tribes were dominant; the Besleneys, [[Abadzekh]]s, [[Ubykh people|Ubykh]]s, [[Shapsugh]]s, and Natkhuagias, portrayed by Russian propaganda as savages in a possible attempt to curry favour from the international community.<ref name="multiple"/> The first of these were particularly involved in raiding Russian outposts in former eastern Circassia, or Kabardia. 
[[Image:Location Sochi.png|left|thumb|270px|Location of the conflict in relation to modern Russia]]

These raids continued for several years, while the Russians continued to fortify their position; constructing the Labinski defensive line in 1840, and beginning to develop a new form of scout, known as a [[plastun]], for scouting Circassian held territory beyond such defensive positions. Russian and Circassian forces clashed repeatedly, particularly on the [[Kuban River|Kuban plains]], where cavalry from both sides could manoeuvre freely.<ref>Karpat, Kemal H. ''Ottoman population 1830<U+2013>1914'', 1985</ref>  

With the Russo-Turkish War raging, Circassia and Turkey united in resisting the Russians, particularly as the Russian forces began to capture positions in Western Circassia, with Turkish commanders fighting alongside Circassian forces, such as on [[April 29]] [[1807]] when the fortress of Anapa fell to Russian forces and the Turkish Pasha fled along with the Circassians. However, on [[September 2]] [[1829]], the Russians and the Turks signed the [[Treaty of Adrianople]], and with this the Turkish influence was removed from western Circassia and the Russian occupation went on unhindered.<ref name="multiple"/>

However, trade between the two factions could not be prevented, and both the Turkish and the English supplied Circassia with firearms and ammunition with which to fight the Russians. England also supplied several advisors, while Turkey attempted to persuade Circassia to start a Holy War, which would draw support from other nations.<ref name="multiple"/> In 1836,  the Russian navy captured an English merchant ship supplying ammunition to the Circassians. This merchant ship was part of an ongoing effort to bring supplies to the Circassians, supplies which also served to inspire more resistance.<ref>Baddeley p.344</ref><ref>Henze, Paul B. ''The North Caucasus Barrier: The Russian Advance Towards The Muslim World''</ref> 
[[Image:Nicholas1.jpg|thumb|right|210px|Tsar [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicolas I]]]]

At this time, the current Russian Tsar, [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]], ordered construction to begin on the coastline, by building fortresses at every point on the captured Black Sea coast that was able to accommodate Russian naval vessels.<ref>Mackie p.208</ref> Cape Alder was one of these locations. On [[June 3]] [[1837]], Russian naval forces under the command Rear-Admiral Esmont, with troops commanded by General Volkhovski, began to head towards Cape Adler, arriving on [[June 6]]. A Russian commander, Baron Rozen, sent a scout ship to locate a place for landing, but it was driven back by Circassian defenders.<ref name="multiple"/>

On [[June 7]] [[1837]], General Volkhovski landed at Cape Alder and entered a nearby forest, through which Circassian defenders had retreated after being bombarded by the Russian ships. In the dense forest, however, the Circassian defenders quietly approached the Russian positions and attacked. They were driven back, but the pursuing Russian forces ran into more Circassian defenders and the messengers sent back for instructions were found by Circassian parties and killed. The Russians were then engaged in hand-to-hand combat with their enemy, and only after the late arrival of reinforcements managed to push the Circassians back and secure Cape Adler. Later that year, Nicholas I visited the area to see the situation for himself.<ref name="multiple"/> 

On [[April 13]] [[1838]], Russian forces engaged the Circassian army in the estuary of [[Sochi|River Sochi]], and on [[May 12]] [[1838]] the Russians landed at [[Tuapse]]. The majority of engagements during this part of the conflict took place in the form of either amphibious landings on coastal towns in accordance with the directive laid out by the Tsar to secure possible ports, or by routing out Circassian forces entrenched in mountain strongholds. At Tuapse, one of the fiercest battles of the conflict, the Russian landing had begun at 10:00 in the morning, and the Circassians were not beaten back from their positions until 5:00 in the afternoon, with the Russians suffering heavy casualties.<ref>Mackie p.207</ref><ref>Baddeley p.313</ref> On the following day, [[May 13]], when arriving to request permission to remove their dead from the battlefield, the Circassians were lectured on the benefits of staying under Russian control by the Russian commanders, Colonel Olshevski and Lieutenant Colonel Baron Grach.<ref name="multiple"/><ref>Mackie p.207</ref>
[[Image:Caucasiamapussr.gif|thumb|left|260px|The modern day Caucasia region, where Circassia was once located]]

In 1839, Russian forces landed at Subash and began construction of a fort, where they faced charges by Ubykh forces who were eventually driven back by shellfire from the Russian navy. Over 1000<ref name="multiple"/> soldiers then charged the Russian positions, however they were outflanked and overrun as they attempted to retreat. This pattern of attack by the Russian forces went on for several years.<ref>Karpat, Kemal H. ''Ottoman population 1830<U+2013>1914'', 1985</ref> 

On [[February 7]] [[1840]], Circassian forces surrounded the Russian fort of Lazarev, stormed it and massacred the defenders. This victory was inspirational to them, and they went on to capture the Veliaminovski fortress and then attack the Mikhailovski fortress with an army of 11,000 men. At this bastion, Russian Staff Captain Liko, Lieutenant Kraumzgold and Ensign Gaevski commanded a handful of companies as a defence force. Liko, upon learning of the fall of the other two fortresses, and knowing that the size of the attack force was far greater than that of his own small command, attempted to increase his chances by choosing to only defend half of the fortress, the half that he most suspected would be attacked.<ref>Baddeley p.344</ref> Staff Captain Liko was badly wounded and other officers were killed at dawn when the attack came, and command fell to an officer cadet named Miroslavski. With the Mikhailovski fortress ablaze and under the control of the Circassians, a Russian soldier ran with a blazing torch into the ammunition cellar, destroying the fort, the surviving defenders, and a significant portion of the Circassian army. The wounded Staff Captain Liko, another [[second lieutenant]], a [[Russian Orthodox]] [[Chaplain]], and 80 other soldiers were taken prisoner.<ref name="multiple"/> The remaining Circassian forces moved on to attack the fort of Golovinski, but were beaten back by the Russian defenders there.<ref name="multiple"/>

===The beginning of the end===
[[Image:Imamshamil.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Imam Shamil]]

Later that year, the Russian Tsesarevich [[Alexander III of Russia]] visited the Russian forces. The fall of Gunib and capture of [[Imam Shamil]] (or Schamyl<ref>Mackie p.1</ref>), a rebel religious leader, by [[Dmitry Milyutin]] in 1859, marked the final conquest of the eastern Circassia lands. Between 1856 and 1859, two defensive lines were built to contain the remaining hostile tribes, the Adagumski Line and the Belorechenski Line. In May 1859, elders from the Bjedughs negotiated a peace with the Russia and submitted to the Tsar, with the oath of loyalty to the Tsar being taken at assembly points beyond the Kuban River. The surviving Circassian leaders saw little chance in resisting against the economic and military superiority of Russia. In [[1840]] alone, the Russian estimate  for artillery cartridge expenditure was 11,344, and for musket cartridges 1,206,575.<ref>Mackie p.292</ref> Many of the remaining tribes soon submitted to the Russians, including the Abadzekhs on [[November 20]] [[1859]].<ref>Mackie p.275</ref> 
[[Image:ZakharovShamilSurrender.jpg|thumb|260px|left|''Imam ShamilShamil's surrender'' by [[Pyotr Zakharov-Chechenets]]. A. P. Yermolov is sitting on the right]]

The Natkhuagias also swore loyalty to the Tsar after they were defeated in January 1860 in battle against Colonel Babich, where their leader was killed. In 1861, the remaining tribes formed a new government called <U+201C>The Mejlis of Free Circassia".<ref name="multiple"/>

At this time, due to the pacification of Daghestan and Chechnia in the wider theatres of what was now the much larger Caucasian War, fresh Russian troops were available and were sent into western Circassia, and the remaining [[Ubykh]]s were killed or forced to flee into the [[Ottoman Empire]].<ref>Baddeley p.458</ref> With the capture of and later loyalty pledge by Iman Shamil,<ref>Baddeley p.459</ref> the Caucasian War, which the Russian-Circassian War grew to be a part of, ended on [[June 2]] [[1864]] ([[May 21]] [[1864]] ([[O.S.]])), in [[Akhchipsou]], as declared by the Tsar's manifesto. [[Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich of Russia]], overall commander of Russian forces in the region, recognized this as the <U+201C>conquest of the Western Caucasus and the end of the Caucasian War.<U+201D><ref name="multiple"/>

==Consequences of the conflict==

===Civilian casualties===
''Main article: [[Circassian ethnic cleansing]]''

Towards the end of the conflict, Russian General Yevdokimov was tasked with forcing the remaining Circassian inhabitants to relocate outside of the region, primarily in the [[Ottoman Empire]]. This policy was enforced by mobile columns of Russian riflemen and Cossack cavalry, and Ottoman Empire figures show nearly 1.75 million migrants entering their land by 1879. Other sources show that as many as 3 million Circassians were forced to flee in total.<ref>Karpat, Kemal H. ''Ottoman population 1830<U+2013>1914'', 1985</ref><ref name="Genocide"/><ref>Levene, Mark ''Genocide in the Age of the Nation-State'' p. 297</ref>

This forced migration, along with the actions of the Russian military in burning villages and the killing of Circassian civilians,<ref name="Shenfield">Shenfield, Stephen D. ''The Circassians: A Forgotten Genocide?'', 1999</ref> has brought about questions of genocide regarding the Russian-Circassian War. [[Karl Friedrich Neumann]], professor at Munich University in [[1839]], estimated the Circassian casualties to be around 1.5 million,<ref>Neumann, Karl Friedrich ''Russland und die Tscherkessen'', 1840</ref> with other sources stating that hundreds of thousands of others died during the exodus.<ref name="Shenfield"/> Other historians, such as Mark Levene, makes several references to the 'Circassian massacres'<ref>Levene, Mark ''Genocide in the Age of the Nation-State'' p. 299</ref> and the consequences of Russian actions in the region.<ref>Levene, Mark ''Genocide in the Age of the Nation-State'' p. 302</ref>

Circassian casualty figures lie near the 4 million mark, while official Russian figures are near 300,000. If Neumann's estimations were correct, it would make it the largest civilian death toll of the 19th century,<ref>Leitzinger, Antero. "The Circassian Genocide".

===Migration===

The war also had extensive consequences in the form of mass migration, both forced and voluntary.<ref>Baddeley p.206</ref> Some sources state that 3,000,000 Circassians were evicted from Circassia up until 1911.<ref>Karpat, Kemal H. ''Ottoman population 1830<U+2013>1914'', 1985</ref> Other sources cite upwards of 2,000,000 Circassian refugees fleeing Circassia by 1914 and entering nations and regions such as the [[Balkans]], [[Turkey]], what was the [[Ottoman Empire]] in what was known as the [[Muhajir (Caucasus)|Muhajir]], [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]], [[Jordan]], [[Kosovo]] (until they were repatriated in 1998, after receiving threats from the ethnic [[Albania]]n Kosovo Liberation Army), [[Egypt]] (Circassians were part of the [[Mamluk]] armies), [[Israel]] (in the villages of [[Kfar Kama]] and Rikhaniya, since 1880)<ref name="UNPOP1"/>  and as far afield as upstate [[New York]] and [[New Jersey]].

According to historians who support the concept of a Circassian genocide, 90 percent of people with Circassian descent now live in other countries, primarily in Turkey, Jordan and other countries of the [[Middle East]], with only 300,000<U+2013>400,000 remaining in what is now [[Russia]].<ref name="Shenfield"/> The depopulated Circassian lands were resettled by numerous ethnic groups, including Russians, [[Ukraine|Ukrainians]] and [[Georgia (country)|Georgians]].<ref name="UNPOP1"/><ref name="Shenfield"/> Friction developed between the latter group and the remaining Circassians (the [[Abkhaz]] tribes), a factor later contributing to [[Georgian-Abkhazian conflict|friction]] between the Georgian and Abkhazian ethnic groups and the resulting [[War in Abkhazia]].<ref name="Shenfield"/>
