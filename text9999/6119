The '''Sch<U+00FC>tte-Lanz SL 11''' was a military dirigible airship built in Germany during 1916.

==Operational history==
The SL 11 was built by [[Luftschiffbau Sch<U+00FC>tte-Lanz]] and thus, was not classed as a [[Zeppelin]]. Based at [[Spich]] and commanded by Hauptmann [[Wilhelm Schramm]], on the early night of September 3, 1916, after having bombed [[Saint Albans]], it was attacked over Hertfordshire by Lt. [[William Leefe Robinson]] in a [[Royal Aircraft Factory BE.2|BE 2C]], using [[incendiary ammunition]]. It crashed at [[Cuffley]], with the loss of the entire crew, who were buried at [[Potters Bar]] Cemetery and re-interred at [[Cannock Chase German war cemetery]] during 1962.<ref name=Baker>{{cite book|last=Baker|first=Brian|title=The Zeppelin Graves on Cannock Chase|date=2002|edition=Second (revised & extended)|publisher=The Association of Friends of Cannock Chase|location=Cannock Chase}} pp 1-2</ref>

==Confusion with LZ 61==
For unknown reasons, when the SL 11 became the first German airship to be shot down over England, it was described officially and in the press as [[LZ 61 (Zeppelin 'L 21')|Zeppelin L 21]] (LZ 61's tactical number). This misidentification persisted for decades, even though it is clear that the authorities were always aware of SL 11's correct identity.

It has been suggested by Ray Rimell that the reason for this confusion was a calculation by the authorities that the downing of a hated and feared Zeppelin 'baby killer', would play better with the public than the destruction of an almost unknown [[Sch<U+00FC>tte-Lanz]] type.<ref name=rimell1>{{cite book |title= Zeppelin!: a battle for air supremacy in World War I|last=Rimell |first=Raymond Laurence |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1984 |publisher= Conway Maritime Press|oclc=10759648|location=London |isbn=978-0-85177-239-4 }}</ref> Accordingly, the 1918 [[drama-documentary]] film ''[[The Last Raid of Zeppelin L-21]]'' told the story of SL 11's destruction and not that of LZ 61.<ref name=allmovie>{{cite web
