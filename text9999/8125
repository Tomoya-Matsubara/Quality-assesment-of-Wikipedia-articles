[[Rear Admiral]] '''George Heneage Lawrence Dundas''' [[Order of the Bath|CB]] (8 September 1778 <U+2013> 7 October 1834) was a [[Royal Navy]]. As a junior officer he came to prominence due to his brave conduct during a fire on the first-rate [[HMS Queen Charlotte (1790)|HMS ''Queen Charlotte'']]. As a result of this he was appointed to the command of the sixth-rate [[HMS Calpe (1800)|HMS ''Calpe'']] in which he took part in the [[Algeciras Campaign|Battle of Algeciras Bay]] in July 1801 during the [[French Revolutionary Wars]]. After serving for four years as [[Whig (British political party)|Whig]] [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Richmond (Yorks) (UK Parliament constituency)|Richmond]], he was given command of the fifth-rate [[HMS Euryalus (1803)|HMS ''Euryalus'']] and took part in the unsuccessful [[Walcheren Campaign]] in July 1809 during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. He transferred to the third-rate [[HMS Edinburgh (1811)|HMS ''Edinburgh'']] and landed troops at [[Viareggio]] in [[Italy]] in November 1812 later in that War. He went on to be Member of Parliament for [[Orkney and Shetland (UK Parliament constituency)|Orkney and Shetland]] and became [[First Sea Lord|First Naval Lord]] in the [[Whig Government 1830<U+2013>1834|First Melbourne ministry]] in August 1834 but died in office just two months later in October 1834.

==Naval career==
===Early career===
Born the fifth son of [[Thomas Dundas, 1st Baron Dundas|Thomas Dundas]] (created [[Marquess of Zetland|Baron Dundas]] in 1794) by his wife Charlotte Dundas (daughter of [[William Fitzwilliam, 3rd Earl Fitzwilliam]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://genealogics.org/getperson.php?personID=I00216954&tree=LEO |title=George Heneage Lawrence Dundas|publisher=Genealogics|accessdate=13 January 2013}}</ref> Dundas became a [[lieutenant]] in the [[Royal Navy]] in 1797 and served for several years with the [[Mediterranean Fleet]].<ref name=parl>{{cite web|url=http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1790-1820/member/dundas-hon-george-heneage-lawrence-1778-1834|title=George Heneage Lawrence Dundas|publisher= UK Parliament|accessdate=13 January 2013}}</ref>

===HMS ''Queen Charlotte''===
In February 1800 Dundas was aboard [[George Elphinstone, 1st Viscount Keith|Lord Keith]]'s flagship, the first-rate [[HMS Queen Charlotte (1790)|HMS ''Queen Charlotte'']]. Dundas was junior to Lieutenant [[Thomas Cochrane, 10th Earl of Dundonald|Lord Cochrane]] but Cochrane had taken command of [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Nelson]]'s prize, the ''Genereaux'', in late 1799 to take her into port; Dundas therefore became 5th Lieutenant of the ''Queen Charlotte''.  One month later, early in the morning of 17 March 1800, cries of "Fire" rang out throughout the vessel. Some hay lying under the half-deck had been set on fire by a match kept there for the signal guns. Dundas was in the forecastle where he organized fire-fighting efforts. Dundas led a party below decks where they secured the main and fore hatches and then opened the lower-deck ports and the sea cocks to flood the lower decks to prevent the fire spreading down. These efforts delayed the fire from reaching the two [[Magazine (artillery)|magazines]]. Dundas continued working below decks until some middle-deck guns fell through the deck. At about 9am Dundas climbed out the foremost lower-deck port and climbed up to the forecastle, joining the about 150 men there who were throwing water on the fire.<ref>James (1837), Vol. 3, p. 7</ref> Despite the crew's exertions, the ''Queen Charlotte'' eventually blew up with the loss of 673 people out of its complement of 840 officers, men and boys, including the Captain and her first Lieutenant. Dundas however survived.<ref name=elliott>{{cite web|url=http://www.elliottdundas.freeserve.co.uk/zetland/record_52.htm |title=Naval Chronicle|publisher=Elliott Dundas|accessdate=13 January 2013}}</ref>

===HMS ''Calpe''===
Following his performance during the fire on HMS ''Queen Charlotte'' Dundas was appointed to the command of the sixth-rate [[HMS Calpe (1800)|HMS ''Calpe'']].<ref name=urban319>Urban, p. 319</ref> On the night of 27 October 1800, [[Francis Beaufort]], inventor of the [[Beaufort scale|Beaufort Wind-Scale]], had led [[HMS Phaeton (1782)|''Phaeton'']]'s boats on a cutting out expedition. They captured the ''San Jos<U+00E9>'', alias ''Aglies'', of 14 guns, which they immediately re-commissioned under the name of HMS ''Calpe'', the ancient name of Gibraltar. Although it would have been usual to promote Beaufort, the successful and heroic leader of the expedition, to command ''Calpe'', [[George Elphinstone, 1st Viscount Keith|Lord Keith]] chose instead to promote Dundas who not only was not present at the battle, but was junior to Beaufort.<ref>James (1837), Vol. 3, p. 56</ref> Dundas was promoted to [[commander]] in December 1800.<ref name=elliott/><ref name=parl/>

In July 1801 Dundas was in command of ''Calpe'' at the [[Algeciras Campaign|Battle of Algeciras Bay]]. After the third-rate [[HMS Hannibal (1786)|HMS ''Hannibal'']] grounded, Dundas, deceived by a signal from her, sent his boats to save ''Hannibal''{{'}}s crew. The French detained the boats and their crews, including ''Calpe''{{'}}s lieutenant, Thomas Sykes; after firing several broadsides at the enemy's shipping and batteries, Dundas and ''Calpe'' returned to Gibraltar.<ref>James (1837), Vol. 3, p. 118</ref> In the subsequent second phase of the Battle of Algeciras Bay, the two Spanish first-rates [[Spanish ship Real Carlos|''Real Carlos'']] and [[Spanish ship Hermenegildo|''Hermenegildo'']] fired upon each other during the night, caught fire and exploded, with tremendous loss of life. The British captured the third-rate [[French ship St Antoine|''St Antoine'']], with [[HMS Superb (1798)|''Superb'']] and ''Calpe'' then assisting in securing the prize and removing the prisoners.<ref>James (1837), Vol. 3, p. 128</ref> Rear Admiral [[James Saumarez, 1st Baron de Saumarez|James Saumarez]] promoted Dundas to [[post-captain]] on 9 August 1801<ref name=elliott/><ref name=parl/> and Dundas took command of ''St Antoine'', which he sailed back to England.<ref name=urban319/>

===Politics===

After the [[Treaty of Amiens|peace of 1802]], Dundas entered politics becoming [[Whig (British political party)|Whig]] [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Richmond (Yorks) (UK Parliament constituency)|Richmond]] in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1802|1802 general election]]<ref>{{London Gazette|startpage=767|issue=15499|date=20 July 1802|accessdate=13 January 2013}}</ref> but resigned in February 1806, using the device of applying to be [[List of Stewards of the Manor of East Hendred|Steward of the Manor of East Hendred]], to take up an offer of a naval command again and to allow his brother, Charles, to enter Parliament.<ref name=parl/> In February 1805 he was given command of the fifth-rate [[HMS Quebec (1781)|HMS ''Quebec'']].<ref name=urban319/>

===HMS ''Euryalus''===

In January 1806 Dundas took command of fifth-rate [[Apollo class frigate]] [[HMS Euryalus (1803)|HMS ''Euryalus'']].<ref>Winfield (2008), p.155-6</ref> Euryalus was asked, along with [[HMS Ocean|HMS ''Ocean'']] and several other warships to act as escorts to a large convoy bound for Oporto, Lisbon and the Mediterranean.  Towards the end of 1807 ''Euryalus'' returned to England with [[HMS Niger (1759)|''Niger'']] as escort to a convoy of several thousand troops under [[Sir John Moore, 1st Baronet|Sir John Moore]] from Gibraltar. She went into dock at Plymouth for a refit and was then stationed in the North Sea.<ref name=marshall>Marshall (1824), Vol. 2, p.421-3</ref> She carried the [[Charles X of France|Duke d'Angoul<U+00EA>me]] from Yarmouth to Gottenburg and escorted the Baltic convoys through the [[Great Belt]].<ref name=marshall/>

In June 1808 Dundas discovered several vessels at anchor at the entrance of [[Nakskov]] close into the shore. He anchored and sent four boats to destroy them. They burnt two large troop transports and captured a gun-vessel armed with two 18-pounders and carrying 64 men. The enemy lost seven men killed and twelve wounded, as well as many drowned; the British had one man slightly wounded.<ref>{{London Gazette|startpage=965|issue=16161|date=9 July 1808|accessdate=13 January 2013}}</ref> During the same year Dundas  went to [[Elbl<U+0105>g|Elbing]], a small port in West Prussia about 60 kilometers east of [[Gdansk|Dantzig]] (now in Poland) to embark [[Princess Marie Josephine Louise of Savoy]] (the consort of [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]]), the Duc du Berry and other members of the French royal family. He took them to [[Karlskrona|Carlscrona]] in southern Sweden and, after re-embarking them at [[Gottenburg]], finally to Harwich.<ref name=marshall/>
 
Dundas was also involved in the [[Walcheren Campaign]] in July 1809 when a British armed force of 39,000 men landed on [[Walcheren]]. ''Euryalus'' joined the squadron which forced the passage of the [[Scheldt]] between the batteries at Flushing and Cadsand on 11 August 1809. ''Euryalus'' had no casualties although two men were killed and nine wounded in the other ships.<ref>James (1837), Vol. 5, p.136</ref> Later she was stationed off [[Cherbourg]] under the orders of Captain [[Sir Richard King, 2nd Baronet|Sir Richard King]], and in November 1809 she captured the French privateer lugger ''Etoile'' of 14 guns and 48 men.<ref>{{London Gazette|startpage=1826|issue=16315|date=14 November 1809|accessdate=13 January 2013}}</ref> In the spring of 1810 ''Euryalus'' escorted a large convoy from Spithead to Portugal and the Mediterranean and was then attached to Captain Blackwood's inshore squadron off Toulon.<ref name=marshall/> 

Early in 1811 Dundas temporarily took command of the 74-gun [[Third-rate|Third Rate]] [[HMS Achille (1798)|''Achille'']] until relieved by Captain [[Aiskew Hollis|Aiskew Paffard Hollis]], who had transferred from [[HMS Standard (1782)|''Standard'']]. Dundas then returned to ''Euryalus''. On 7 June 1811 the boats of ''Euryalus'' and [[HMS Swallow (1805)|''Swallow'']] captured the French privateer ''Intrepide'' off Corsica after a long chase. She had a crew of 58 and was armed with two 8-pounders.<ref>{{London Gazette|startpage=1571|endpage=1572|issue=16512|date=10 August 1811|accessdate=13 January 2013}}</ref>

Dundas became Member of Parliament for Richmond again at a by-election in 1812 but was defeated at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1812|1812 general election]].<ref name=parl/>

===HMS ''Edinburgh''===

[[File:Porto D'Anzo 1845.jpg|right|300px|thumb|''Porto D'Anzo'', [[Edward Lear]], 1845, [[Auckland Art Gallery]]]]
In October 1812 Dundas transferred to the 74-gun [[Third-rate|Third Rate]] [[HMS Edinburgh (1811)|''Edinburgh'']]. In 1813 Dundas and ''Edinburgh'' were in the Mediterranean. On the morning of 5 October, ''Edinburgh'' joined Capt. Duncan of [[HMS Imperieuse (1804)|''Imperieuse'']] off [[Anzio|Porto D'Anzo]] where he and [[HMS Resistance (1805)|''Resistance'']], ''Swallow'', [[HMS Eclaire (1807)|''Eclair'']] and [[HMS Pylades (1794)|''Pylades'']] had been watching a convoy for some days with the intention of attacking it.<ref name=james34>James (1837), Vol. 6, p. 34</ref> The place was defended by two batteries mounting three heavy guns each on the [[Mole (architecture)|mole]], a tower with one gun and a battery with two guns. During the attack in the afternoon, ''Edinburgh'' supported ''Eclair'' and ''Pylades'' as they bore up against the battery to the south. After the ships opened fire, landing parties brought out the 29 vessels of the convoy, 20 of which were laden with wood for the arsenal at Toulon. All the works were blown up.<ref name=james34/>

On 30 November 1812 Dundas was placed in command of a small squadron consisting of ''Edinburgh'', [[HMS Furieuse (1809)|''Furieuse'']] and [[HMS Termagant (1796)|''Termagant'']] which landed troops at [[Viareggio]] in [[Italy]]. Some 600 cavalry and infantry from the [[Livorno]] garrison attacked the troops, who routed them, capturing two field pieces and a howitzer. From the prisoners they learned of the weak state of the garrison and asked to be re-embarked to be taken to Livorno. Boats of the squadron towed them off the shore in country vessels and the ships towed the whole to the Livorno roads. The troops and Marines landed on the evening of 13 December and they occupied the suburbs of the town. Some 700 cavalry and infantry attacked the marines, who opened to let the cavalry pass through them, killing all but 14 and 2 officers. Of these, the Italian levy killed all but one officer. The marines charged and routed the remainder, killing, wounding or taking prisoner between 250 and 300 men. ''Edinburgh'' had three marines wounded.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=16847|startpage=178|endpage=179|date=22 January 1814|accessdate=13 January 2013}}</ref>

==Post-war==

At the end of the war, Dundas left the ''Edinburgh'' at Genoa and traveled overland back to Britain. After retiring from the Navy in 1815,<ref name=parl/> he became a [[Order of the Bath|Companion of the Bath]] that year.<ref name=urban319/>

Dundas won a seat as Member of Parliament for [[Orkney and Shetland (UK Parliament constituency)|Orkney and Shetland]] at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1818|1818 general election]] but was defeated at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1820|1820 general election]].<ref name=parl/> He again became Member of Parliament for Orkney and Shetland at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1826|1826 general election]] but was defeated again at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1830|1830 general election]].<ref name=parl/> He was also promoted to [[rear-admiral]] in 1830.<ref>{{London Gazette|startpage=1541|issue=18709|date=23 July 1830|accessdate=13 January 2013}}</ref>

Dundas became [[Second Sea Lord|Second Naval Lord]] in the [[Whig Government 1830<U+2013>1834|Grey ministry]] in November 1830; having been appointed a [[Deputy Lieutenant]] of [[York]] in 1831,<ref>{{London Gazette|startpage=1506|issue=18828|date=26 July 1831|accessdate=13 January 2013}}</ref> he was elevated to [[First Sea Lord|First Naval Lord]] in the [[Whig Government 1830<U+2013>1834|First Melbourne ministry]] in August 1834<ref name=sainty>{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=16652|title='Lord High Admiral and Commissioners of the Admiralty 1660-1870', Office-Holders in Modern Britain: Volume 4: Admiralty Officials 1660-1870 |first=J C |last =Sainty||year=1975|pages=18-31|accessdate=13 January 2013}}</ref> but died in office, unmarried, of [[apoplexy]] at [[Upleatham]] in [[North Yorkshire]] just two months later on 7 October 1834.<ref name=elliott/> He is buried at [[Marske-by-the-Sea|Marske]] in North Yorkshire.<ref name=elliott/>
