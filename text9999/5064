'''La Stazione''' is a restaurant and former [[train station]] in [[New Paltz (village), New York|New Paltz]], [[New York]]. The station was originally built by the [[Wallkill Valley Railroad]] in 1870, but burned down and was rebuilt in 1907. Passenger service along the line ceased in 1937, and by 1958 the station was completely closed and sold off. The building was in such a state of disrepair by the 1980s that it was almost demolished. It was renovated in 1988 and used as a [[real estate]] office. In 1999 it became an Italian restaurant, and served as the setting for a scene in a 2008 [[mob film]]. It is the only former station of the Wallkill Valley rail line standing at its original location.

=== Construction and opening ===
[[File:Beers Ulster County Atlas Page097.jpg|thumb|left|An 1875 map showing the newly built rail depot in the village, east of the [[Wallkill River]]]]
As early as February 1864, plans were underway to extend the proposed [[Wallkill Valley Railroad]] between the towns of [[Shawangunk, New York|Shawangunk]] and [[New Paltz, New York|New Paltz]].<ref>{{Cite news |title=Railroad Meeting |newspaper=New Paltz Times |location=New Paltz, NY |date=1864-02-14}}</ref> A [[civil engineering]] survey to determine a possible route and cost of such an endeavor was undertaken in March of that year.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Wallkill Valley Railroad from Shawangunk to New Paltz Report and Estimate |newspaper=New Paltz Times |location=New Paltz, NY |date=1864-03-25 |first=Sidney G. |last=Miller}}</ref> The proposed route sparked a controversy over whether the route would run east or west of the [[Wallkill River]] in New Paltz. The western route was roughly {{convert|100|ft|m}} shorter, and the eastern route would cost $25,000 more. However, it was felt that the increased economic activity from having the rail line run east of the river, and directly through the [[New Paltz (village), New York|village of New Paltz]], would offset the expense.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Rail-Road Meetings |newspaper=New Paltz Times |publisher=C.J.

By November 1869, the [[Gardiner, New York|Gardiner]] rail depot had opened and was seeing regular traffic.<ref>{{Cite news |newspaper=New Paltz Independent |location=New Paltz, NY |date=1869-11-11}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |newspaper=New Paltz Independent |location=New Paltz, NY |date=1869-11-18}}</ref> The railroad was contractually obligated to be in New Paltz by May 18, 1870,<ref>{{Cite news |title=Railroad Progress |newspaper=New Paltz Independent |location=New Paltz, NY |date=1869-08-19}}</ref> and work on the New Paltz station commenced that day. The depot was designed to be {{convert|20|ft|m}} by {{convert|80|ft|m}}.<ref>{{Cite news |newspaper=New Paltz Independent |location=New Paltz, NY |date=1869-05-25}}</ref> It included freight and baggage rooms, as well as a [[water tank]] and [[Motive power depot|engine house]]. The station also had two waiting rooms, while most stations on the Wallkill line only had one.<ref name="mabee=47" />

Half the lumber came from [[Honesdale, Pennsylvania|Honesdale]], Pennsylvania via the [[Delaware and Hudson Canal]].<ref>{{Cite news |newspaper=New Paltz Independent |location=New Paltz, NY |date=1870-05-09}}</ref> The depot's [[Framing (construction)|framework]] was raised on July 1, 1870,<ref>{{Cite news |newspaper=New Paltz Independent |location=New Paltz, NY |date=1870-07-07}}</ref> and the depot itself was completed by September 1870. John C. Shaffer had been the [[General contractor|contractor]], John C. Deyo had provided the [[carpentry]], and Snyder and Fuller had painted it.<ref>{{Cite news |newspaper=New Paltz Times |date=1870-09-01 |location=New Paltz, NY}}</ref>

The [[masonry]] for a bridge over the [[Plattekill Creek]] between Gardiner and New Paltz was completed by late June 1870,<ref>{{Cite news |newspaper=New Paltz Times |location=New Paltz, NY |date=1870-06-30}}</ref> and [[trestle]] work was done by July.<ref>{{Cite news |newspaper=New Paltz Independent |location=New Paltz, NY |date=1870-07-14}}</ref> Beginning in late September 1870, the railroad had begun laying [[Track (rail transport)|tracks]] between Gardiner and New Paltz.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Railroad Items |newspaper=New Paltz Independent |location=New Paltz, NY |date=1870-09-22}}</ref> The tracks reached the Plattekill Creek bridge by the end of October,<ref>{{Cite news |title=Railroad Items |newspaper=New Paltz Independent |location=New Paltz, NY |date=1870-10-27}}</ref> and the rail line finally reached New Paltz on December 1, 1870.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Rail Line Completed to New Paltz |newspaper=New Paltz Times |location=New Paltz, NY |date=1870-12-01}}</ref> The rail line was officially opened at New Paltz on December 20, 1870 during a day-long celebration. At that time, the Wallkill Valley Railroad was connected to the [[Erie Railroad]]'s Montgomery<U+2013>Goshen branch to the south; an inaugural train ran to [[Goshen (town), New York|Goshen]], making stops at each station along the way, before heading back to New Paltz with about 350 passengers.<ref name="mabee-12-14">{{Harvnb|Mabee|1995|pp=12<U+2013>14}}</ref>

As soon as the station was completed, a second station was built at Springtown,<ref name="mabee-52-155">{{Harvnb|Mabee|1995|pp=52, 155}}</ref> a [[Administrative divisions of New York#Hamlet|hamlet]] in the northwestern part of the town of New Paltz.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sylvester|1880|p=13}}</ref> It burned down and was not fully rebuilt until 1911.<ref name="mabee-52-155" /> The [[New York Public Service Commission]], a [[regulatory agency]] founded in 1907,<ref>{{Cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=FWc2AAAAIAAJ |title=Reports of the Board of Public Utility Commissioners of the State of New Jersey |page=240 |year=1917 |volume=4 |publisher=Hudson Printing Company |location=Union Hill, NJ}}</ref> ruled in May 1911 that the new Springtown station was adequate.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://news.hrvh.org/cgi-bin/newshrvh?a=d&d=kingstondaily19110526.2.7 |title=Springtown Satisfied |newspaper=[[Daily Freeman]] |location=Kingston, NY |date=1911-05-26 |accessdate=2011-01-23 |volume=40 |page=2}}</ref> The Springtown station had no [[station agent]] or freight house.<ref name="mabee-52-155" />

Two sheds had been built adjacent to the New Paltz station by 1881.<ref>{{Cite news |newspaper=New Paltz Independent |date=1881-06-23 |location=New Paltz, NY}}</ref> The land the sheds were built on was purchased the previous year by [[Mohonk Mountain House]] co-founder [[Albert Smiley]] for $500.<ref>{{Cite news |newspaper=New Paltz Independent |date=1880-12-16 |location=New Paltz, NY}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.illustratedredlands.com/Individuals/SmileyAHAK.htm |title=Alfred H.

=== 1907 Fire ===
The original station burned down on April 23, 1907. The fire damaged freight and killed the station agent's dog.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://news.hrvh.org/cgi-bin/newshrvh?a=d&d=kingstondaily19070423.2.24 |title=Fire Damages New Paltz Station |newspaper=[[Daily Freeman]] |location=Kingston, NY |date=1907-04-23 |accessdate=2010-12-08 |volume=32 |page=3}}</ref> A [[Passenger car (rail)|passenger car]] was used as a temporary station while the building was rebuilt.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://news.hrvh.org/cgi-bin/newshrvh?a=d&d=kingstondaily19070503.2.4 |title=Station in a Car |newspaper=[[Daily Freeman]] |location=Kingston, NY |date=1907-05-03 |accessdate=2010-12-08 |volume=32 |page=1}}</ref> By late September 1907, the concrete foundation and the framework of the new building had been put in place,<ref>{{Cite news |newspaper=New Paltz Independent |date=1907-09-27 |location=New Paltz, NY}}</ref> but work on the interior didn't begin until November, due to a lack of lumber.<ref>{{Cite news |newspaper=New Paltz Independent |date=1907-11-08 |location=New Paltz, NY}}</ref> The depot was completely rebuilt by December 31, 1907,<ref>{{Cite news |newspaper=New Paltz Independent |date=1907-12-31 |location=New Paltz, NY}}</ref> and in active use by February 7, 1908.<ref>{{Cite news |newspaper=New Paltz Independent |date=1908-02-07 |location=New Paltz, NY}}</ref> While the original station had a [[Gable|gabled roof]], the rebuilt station was [[hip roof|hipped]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Mabee|1995|p=49}}</ref> The rebuilt freight house was placed a distance from the depot.<ref>{{Cite news |newspaper=New Paltz Independent |date=1907-08-30 |location=New Paltz, NY}}</ref>

=== Closure and renovation ===
Passenger service along the Wallkill Valley line ceased in 1937,<ref>{{Cite news |newspaper=New Paltz Independent and Times |date=1937-08-12 |location=New Paltz, NY}}</ref> and by December 1958 the building (then owned by the [[New York Central Railroad]]) was no longer used as a railroad station.<ref name="close">{{Cite news |title=New York Central to Close Stations at New Paltz, Wallkill, Walden, Rosendale, Gardiner |date=1958-12-17 |newspaper=New Paltz Independent and Times |location=New Paltz, NY}}</ref><ref name="track">{{Cite news |title=Back on Track |newspaper=[[Times Herald-Record]] |publisher=[[Dow Jones Local Media Group]] |date=1988-03-09 |location=Middletown, NY}}</ref> It was sold off in 1959,<ref name="zoning-1">{{Cite news |newspaper=New Paltz News |location=New Paltz, NY |date=1977-04-13 |title='No Bar in R.R.

In April 1977, the owners of the property, Fetner and Gold Associates, attempted to open the building as a bar. The [[Special-use permit|zoning permit]] was rejected; the village mayor was "unalterably opposed" to the prospect, and the board believed that opening the building as a bar would lead to complaints from nearby apartments. It was also believed that it would be unsafe to open a bar adjacent to an active rail line, and that such a venture would threaten the nearby [[Huguenot Street Historic District]].<ref name="zoning-1" /><ref name="zoning-2" /> On December 31, 1977, all regular [[Freight rail transport|freight service]] ceased along the Wallkill Valley line.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mabee|1995|p=135}}</ref> By the early 1980s the depot had become a "hangout for youths to drink and carouse" and the village considered dismantling it.<ref>{{Cite news |first=Jeff |last=Muise |page=30 |newspaper=[[Times Herald-Record]] |publisher=[[Dow Jones Local Media Group]] |date=1984-01-25 |location=Middletown, NY}}</ref> [[Consolidated Rail Corporation|Conrail]], at that time the owner of the rail line, removed all tracks along the corridor between 1983 and 1984 and salvaged the steel.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mabee|1995|p=139}}</ref>

Robert Mark Realty bought the former station in 1986,<ref name="pasta" /> and renovated it at a cost of $175,000.<ref name="track" /> Renovations began in October 1987 and were more than halfway done by January 1988. Matt Bialecki, the architect who had overseen the renovation of the former New Paltz [[opera house]] as a restaurant, served as the project's architect. Wilro Builders acted as the contractor. The building served as a [[real estate]] office.<ref>{{Cite news |title=New Paltz rail station to become real estate office |newspaper=Huguenot Herald |date=1988-01-07}}</ref> On February 9, 1999, the village approved a plan to allow the building to open as a 36-seat [[Italian-American cuisine|Italian restaurant]], under the co-ownership of two men, Jeff DiMarco and Rocco Panetta. The station was given its current name, ''La Stazione''.<ref name="permit">{{Cite news |title=Rail station to become restaurant |first=Chiho |last=Suzuki |date=1999-02-11 |newspaper=[[Daily Freeman]] |location=Kingston, NY |publisher=[[Journal Register Company]]}}</ref><ref name="pasta" /><ref name="gateway">{{Cite news |newspaper=New Paltz News |date=1999-02-17 |title=A new restaurant for the New Paltz Gateway |first=Diane |last=Fanelli |location=New Paltz, NY}}</ref> DiMarco had previously managed construction for an adjacent restaurant, the ''Gilded Otter''. He sold his ownership of La Stazione in August 2000.<ref>{{Cite news |newspaper=Huguenot Herald |title=Custom home building |date=2000-08-17 |location=New Paltz, NY}}</ref>

The building is adjacent to a [[rail trail]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Perls |first=Jeffrey |title=Shawangunks Trail Companion: A Complete Guide to Hiking, Mountain Biking, Cross-Country Skiing, and More Only 90 Miles from New York City |publisher=Countryman Press |location=Woodstock, VT |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-88150-563-4 |page=342}}</ref> In 1991, the village of New Paltz purchased its section of the former Wallkill Valley rail corridor from Conrail, formally opening it as a public walkway, the [[Wallkill Valley Rail Trail]], on October 9, 1993.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mabee|1995|pp=141<U+2013>144}}</ref> The permit allowing La Stazione to operate as a restaurant required the placement of a sign in the building's parking lot to indicate the presence of the trail.<ref name="gateway" /> The village allowed La Stazione to place a public picnic table under an [[Overhang (architecture)|overhang]] by the rail trail, on the condition that the restaurant does not provide outdoor food service. In August 1999, the restaurant was forced to remove a [[Fuel tank|gas tank]] and gas line that were placed under the trail, or risk losing its [[certificate of occupancy]].<ref>{{Cite news |title=La Stazione required to meet site plans |date=1999-08-18 |newspaper=New Paltz News |location=New Paltz, NY |first=Diane |last=Fanelli}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |title=Dispute concerning La Stazione's encroachment on the rail trail settled |date=1999-08-19 |newspaper=Huguenot Herald |location=New Paltz, NY |first=Erin |last=Quinn}}</ref> When the Gardiner station burned down on October 10, 2002, La Stazione became the last former rail station of the Wallkill Valley Railroad remaining at its original location.<ref name="mabee=47">{{Harvnb|Mabee|1995|p=47}}</ref><ref name="gardiner-fire">{{Cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=lLtzNmX9EYQC&pg=PA22#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Gardiner and Lake Minnewaska |first=Carleton |last=Mabee |page=22 |year=2003 |isbn=0-7385-1185-4 |publisher=[[Arcadia Publishing]] |location=Mount Pleasant, SC}}</ref>

A scene from the 2008 [[mob film]] ''Front Man'' was filmed at La Stazione; the film's director, Ray Genadry, is the cousin of the restaurant's owner, Rocco Panetta. The scene featured Chris Colombo, son of the late [[Joseph Colombo]], a former boss of the [[Colombo crime family]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.recordonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070818/NEWS/708180326 |title=New Paltz restaurant a hit in 'Mob" movie |first=Oliver |last=Mackson |date=2007-08-18 |accessdate=2010-12-14 |newspaper=[[Times Herald-Record]] |publisher=[[Dow Jones Local Media Group]] |location=Middletown, NY}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1351150/ |title=Front Man (2008) |publisher=[[IMDB]] |accessdate=2010-12-14}}</ref> Colombo had previously starred in a 2005 mobster documentary on [[HBO]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.recordonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070401/NEWS/704010329 |title=After a trial fails to find him guilty of racketeering, Chris Colombo explores a few new possibilities |first=Oliver |last=Mackson |date=2007-04-01 |accessdate=2010-12-14 |newspaper=[[Times Herald-Record]] |publisher=[[Dow Jones Local Media Group]] |location=Middletown, NY}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0495124/ |title=House Arrest Starring Chris Colombo (TV 2005) |publisher=[[IMDB]] |accessdate=2010-12-14}}</ref>
