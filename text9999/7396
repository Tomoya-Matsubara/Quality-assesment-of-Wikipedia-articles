==Plot==
{{spoiler}}
Tom enjoys riding a motorcycle and he loves his mother dearly, but Tom is no ordinary
fellow. He is the leader of a violent, occult motorcycle gang appropriately called
"The Living Dead," and his mother together with sinister butler gets her kicks out
of holding seances in her home. Through her, Tom makes a pact with the Devil to return
from the dead. One by one, he and his fellow bikers commit suicide and return to a 
secret place called "The Seven Witches." Or do they? Is the butler really just a faithful
servant in a mystical household, or is he really Satan himself?
