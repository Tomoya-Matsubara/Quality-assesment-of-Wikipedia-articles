{{DISPLAYTITLE:Development of ''Duke Nukem Forever''}}
The [[video game]] ''[[Duke Nukem Forever]]'' spent fifteen years in development, from 1996 to 2011. It is a [[first-person shooter]] for [[Personal computer|PC]], [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dukenukemforever.com/ |title=Duke Nukem Forever Official Website}}</ref> developed by [[3D Realms]], Triptych Games, [[Gearbox Software]] and [[Piranha Games]]. It is a sequel to the 1996 game ''[[Duke Nukem 3D]]'', as part of the long-running ''[[Duke Nukem]]'' video game series. Intended to be groundbreaking, ''Duke Nukem Forever'' has become infamous in the video games industry and was considered [[vaporware]] due to its severely protracted [[development hell|development schedule]]; the game had been in development under [[3D Realms]] since 1996. Director [[George Broussard]], one of the creators of the original ''[[Duke Nukem (1991 video game)|Duke Nukem]]'' game, first announced the title's development in April 1997, and promotional information for the game was released in one form or another from 1997 until its release in 2011.

After repeatedly announcing and deferring release dates, 3D Realms announced in 2001 that it would be released simply "when it's done". In May 2009, 3D Realms was downsized for financial reasons, resulting in the loss of the game's development team.  Statements by the company indicated that the project was due to "go [[Release to manufacture|gold]]" soon with pictures of final development. [[Take-Two Interactive]], which owns the publishing rights to the game, filed a lawsuit in 2009 against 3D Realms over their "failure to finish development". 3D Realms retorted that Take-Two's legal interest in the game is limited to their publishing right. The case was settled with [[prejudice (legal procedure)|prejudice]] and details undisclosed in May 2010. On September 3, 2010, 14 years after the start of the development, ''Duke Nukem Forever'' was officially reported by [[2K Games]] to be in development at [[Gearbox Software]],<ref>{{cite news|last=McWhertor|first=Michael|title=It<U+2019>s Official: Duke Nukem Forever Coming From Gearbox In 2011|url=http://kotaku.com/5628894/its-official-duke-nukem-forever-coming-from-gearbox-software|accessdate=11 January 2013|newspaper=Kotaku|date=3 September 2010}}</ref> with an expected release date of 2011.<ref>{{cite web| author=Jessica Citizen |url=http://www.gamepron.com/news/2010/09/03/duke-nukem-forever/ |title=Duke Nukem Forever confirmed! |date=September 4, 2010 |accessdate=September 4, 2010}}</ref> The official release date was then revealed to be May 3, 2011 in North America, with a worldwide release following on May 6, 2011.<ref name="gameinformer_releasedate">{{cite web |url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2011/01/21/exclusive-duke-nukem-forever-has-a-release-date.aspx |title=Exclusive: Duke Nukem Forever Has A Release Date |author=Jeff Cork |publisher=[[GameInformer]] |date=2011-01-21 |accessdate=2011-01-21}}</ref> This was however delayed by a month to June 10 internationally with a North American release on June 14.<ref>{{cite web|author=Andy Robinson |url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/295133/news/duke-nukem-forever-delayed-again-really/|title=Duke Nukem Forever delayed again (really) |date=March 24, 2011 |accessdate=March 24, 2011}}</ref> ''Duke Nukem Forever'' was finally released after 15 years of development on June 10, 2011.

==Background==
[[Scott Miller (entrepreneur)|Scott Miller]] was a lifelong gamer who released his text-based video games as [[shareware]] in the 1980s. By 1988, the shareware business was a $10 to $20 million a year market, but the distribution method had never been tried for video games. Miller found that gamers were not willing to pay for something they could get for free, so he came up with the idea of offering only the opening levels of his games; players could purchase the game to receive the rest of the game.<ref name="kushner-60">[[#Kushner2004|Kushner (2004)]], 60<U+2013>61.</ref> [[George Broussard]], whom Miller met while he was in high school, joined Miller at his company, [[3D Realms|Apogee]], which published and marketed games developed by other companies. While Miller was quiet, with a head for business, Broussard was an enthusiastic "creative impresario". Apogee (from which a new brand name was made in 1994, 3D Realms) grew from a small startup to a successful corporation.<ref name="thompson-1">[[#Thompson2009|Thompson (2009)]], 1.</ref> Among the titles they published was [[id Software]]'s ''[[Commander Keen]]'' in 1990 and ''[[Wolfenstein 3D]]'' in 1992. Commander Keen met great success, leading to the development of many sidescrollers for the [[MS-DOS|DOS]] platform, including many developed by Apogee and using the same engine that powered the ''Keen'' games, and Wolfenstein was highly successful, popularizing 3D gaming and establishing the [[first-person shooter]] (FPS) genre.<ref name="wolf-156">{{Cite book|author=Wolf, Mark J|year=2008|title=The Video Game Explosion: A History From Pong to Playstation and Beyond|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=0-313-33868-X|page=156}}</ref>

By 1994, Broussard began working on 3D Realms' own first-person shooter. Rather than the faceless marine of other games, players assumed the role of [[Duke Nukem (character)|Duke Nukem]], a character who Broussard described as "a combo of [[John Wayne]], [[Clint Eastwood]], and [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]", and who had previously starred in two 2D platformers, ''[[Duke Nukem (1991 video game)|Duke Nukem]]'' and ''[[Duke Nukem II]]'', developed by Apogee. After a year and a half of work, ''[[Duke Nukem 3D]]'' was released in January 1996.<ref name="thompson-1"/> Among game aspects that appealed to players were environmental interaction and adult-oriented content<U+2014>including blood and strippers.<ref name="trueman">{{cite web|author=Trueman, Doug|date=January 18, 2000|url=http://www.gamespot.com/features/vgs/universal/duke_hist/p3_01.html|title=The History of Duke Nukem: Duke Enters the Third Dimension|publisher=[[Gamespot]]|accessdate=December 24, 2009}}</ref> Buoyed by the success, Broussard announced a follow-up, ''Duke Nukem Forever''.<ref name="thompson-1"/>

==''Quake II'' engine, 1996<U+2013>1998==
''Duke Nukem Forever'' was officially announced on April 28, 1997,<ref name="wernicke-1"/> with the intention of releasing the game no later than mid-1998.<ref>[[#3DRealms1997|3D Realms (1997)]].</ref> Barely a year after the release of ''Duke Nukem 3D'', the game's graphics and its game engine, the [[Build engine]], were antiquated. Id Software's new [[Id Tech 2 (Quake II engine)|Quake II engine]] was far superior to Build, so Broussard decided to license it.<ref name="wernicke-1">[[#Wernicke1998|Wernicke (1998)]], 1.</ref><ref name="thompson-2">[[#Thompson2009|Thompson (2009)]], 2.</ref> The price spent for the licensing rights was steep<U+2014>estimates were as high as $500,000<U+2014>but Broussard reasoned that it would save time used to write a game engine from scratch.<ref name="thompson-2"/> Broussard and Miller were flush with cash from the sales of ''Duke Nukem 3D'' and other games, so they decided to fund ''Duke Nukem Forever'' themselves, turning marketing and publishing rights over to [[GT Interactive]].<ref name="thompson-3">[[#Thompson2009|Thompson (2009)]], 3.</ref>

In August and September, the first screenshots of ''Duke Nukem Forever'' were released in ''[[PC Gamer]]''. However, 3D Realms did not receive the Quake II engine code until November 1997, and the earlier screenshots were mock-ups with the Quake engine that the team had made in their spare time.<ref name="reed">{{cite web|author=Reed, Kristan|date=May 30, 2003|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/a_fallofdukenukem|title=The Fall Of Duke Nukem|publisher=[[Eurogamer]]|accessdate=December 24, 2009}}</ref> 3D Realms unveiled the first video footage of ''Duke Nukem Forever'' using the Quake II engine at the 1998 [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]] (E3) conference.<ref name="reed"/> The trailer showed Duke fighting on the back of a moving truck and firefights with aliens. While critics were impressed, Broussard was not happy with the progress being made.<ref name="thompson-2"/>

==''Unreal'' engine, 1998<U+2013>2003==
[[File:Duke Nukem Screenshot2.jpg|left|thumb|''Duke Nukem Forever'', as of 1999, showing the games graphics during early stages of development.]]
Soon after the release of the Quake II engine, [[Epic Games]] had unveiled its own [[Unreal Engine]]. The Unreal Engine was more realistic than Quake II and was better suited to producing open spaces<U+2014>3D Realms had been struggling to render the Nevada desert. Soon after E3, a programmer suggested that they make the switch. After discussions, the developers unanimously agreed to the change, which would mean scrapping much of their work so far,<ref name="thompson-2"/> including significant changes 3D Realms had made to the Quake Engine.<ref name="wernicke-2">[[#Wernicke1998|Wernicke (1998)]], 2.</ref> In June 1998, 14 months after the Quake II announcement, 3D Realms made the switch announcement. Broussard said that the game would not be "significantly delayed" by the switch, but that the project would be back to where it was at E3 "within a month to six weeks". Broussard also said that no content seen in the E3 trailer would be lost.<ref name="3drealms-engine switch">[[#3DRealms1998|3D Realms (1998)]].</ref> Chris Hargrove, one of the game's programmers at the time, confided that the change amounted to a complete reboot of the project.<ref name="thompson-2"/>

By the end of 1999, ''Duke Nukem Forever'' had missed several release dates and was largely unfinished; half the game's weapons remained concepts.<ref name="thompson-2"/> Broussard shot back at criticisms of the game's lengthy development time as the price paid for developing complex modern games:
A significant factor contributing to the game's protracted development was that Broussard was continually looking to add new elements to the game. A running joke at 3D Realms was to stop Broussard from seeing a new video game, as he would want to include portions of it in ''Duke Nukem Forever''. Later that year, Broussard decided to upgrade to a new version of the Unreal engine that was designed for [[multiplayer]] matches. Former employees recalled that Broussard did not have a plan for what the finished game would look like.<ref name="thompson-2"/> At the same time, GT Interactive was facing higher-than-expected losses and hired [[Bear Stearns]] to look into selling the company or merging it.<ref name="cnet-gt interactive">{{cite web|author=Barrett, Larry|date=June 29, 1999|url=http://news.cnet.com/GT-Interactive-misses-in-4Q,-looks-for-sugar-daddy/2100-12_3-258863.html|title=GT Interactive misses in 4Q, looks for sugar daddy|publisher=[[CNET]]|accessdate=January 1, 2010}}</ref> Later that year, [[Infogrames Entertainment, SA|Infogrames Entertainment]] announced it was purchasing a controlling interest in GT Interactive.<ref>{{Cite news|author=Doebele, Justin|date=December 27, 1999|url=http://www.forbes.com/global/1999/1227/0226009a.html|title=Another Look|work=[[Forbes (magazine)|Forbes]]|page=1|accessdate=December 26, 2009}}</ref> The publishing rights for ''Duke Nukem Forever'' passed to [[Gathering of Developers]] in early December 2000.<ref>[[#3DRealms2000|3D Realms (2000)]].</ref>

To placate anxious fans, Broussard decided to create another trailer for E3 2001<U+2014>it was the first public look at the game in three years.<ref name="thompson-3"/> The video showed a couple of minutes of in-game footage,<ref name="ign-e32001"/> which notably showed the player moving in what appears to be Las Vegas and a certain level of interactivity (the player buys a sandwich from a vending machine and pushes each individual button on a [[keypad]] with Duke's outstretched finger). The trailer was impressive, and ''Duke Nukem'' was the talk of the convention;<ref name="thompson-3"/> IGN reported on the game's graphics, saying, "Characters come to life with picturesque facial animations that are synced perfectly with speech, hair that swings as they bob their heads, eyes that follow gazes, and more. The particle effects system, meanwhile, boasts impressive explosion effects with shimmering fire, shattered glass, and blood spilt in every direction [...] Add in real-time lighting effects, interactive environments, and a variation in locales unequaled in any other first-person shooter and you begin to see and understand why Duke Nukem Forever has been one of the most hotly anticipated titles over the last couple of years."<ref name="ign-e32001">{{cite web|author=Cassamassina, Matt; IGN Staff|date=June 1, 2001|url=http://pc.ign.com/articles/123/123880p1.html|title=Duke Nukem Forever; Duke Nukem Forever's been a long time coming, but it looks like the wait will be worth it|publisher=IGN|accessdate=January 1, 2010}}</ref> ''Duke Nukem Forever'' looked as good or better than most games, and staff at 3D Realms recalled a sense of elation after the presentation; "The video was just being eaten up by people," one said. "We were so far ahead of other people at the time." While many of the staff expected Broussard to make a push for finishing the game, however, he still did not have a finished product in mind.<ref name="thompson-3"/> Following the death of one of Gathering of Developers' co-founders and continuing financial problems, the publishers' Texas-based offices were shut down and absorbed into parent company [[Take-Two Interactive]].<ref name="thorsen2003">{{cite web|author=Thorsen, Tor|date=December 18, 2003|url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/action/dukenukemforever/news_6085889.html|title=No Duke Nukem Forever 'til 2005?|publisher=[[Gamespot]]|accessdate=February 1, 2010}}</ref>

By 2003, only 18&nbsp;people at 3D Realms were working on the game. One former employee said that Broussard and Miller were still operating on a "1995 mentality", before games became large-team, big budget development affairs.

[[File:Dukenukemforever2007.jpg|thumb|right|''Duke Nukem Forever'' developers released this promotional image in 2007, to reinvigorate attention the stalled game.]]
The long delay strained Broussard and Miller's relationship, and by the end of 2006, Broussard appeared to become serious about shipping the title.<ref name="thompson-4"/> On January 25 and  May 22, 2007, Broussard posted two [[Gamasutra]] job ads with small screenshots of Duke Nukem and an enemy, which he later confirmed were real in-game screenshots.<ref>{{cite web|author=Sinclair, Brendan|url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/6164892.html|title=Duke Nukem Forever resurfaces|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|accessdate=January 26, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Broussard, George|url=http://forums.3drealms.com/vb/showthread.php?t=26857l|title= Programmer ad|publisher=[[3D Realms]]|accessdate=May 22, 2007}}</ref> The team doubled in size within a short timeframe.

While the game neared completion, the funding began to dry up. Having spent more than $20&nbsp;million of their own money, Broussard and Miller asked Take-Two for $6&nbsp;million to complete the game.
