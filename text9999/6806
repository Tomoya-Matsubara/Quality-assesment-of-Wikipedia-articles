'''Winchester Dana Osgood''' (April 12, 1870 <U+2013> October 18, 1896) was a prominent American college athlete in the late 19th century at both [[Cornell University]] and [[University of Pennsylvania]].  He played [[Halfback (American football)|halfback]] on the [[American football|football]] teams at both schools and served as the head football coach at [[Indiana University (Bloomington)|Indiana University]] for one season in 1895, compiling a record of 4<U+2013>3<U+2013>1.  Osgood volunteered for the Cuban forces during [[Cuba]]<U+2019>s fight for Independence from Spain.  He was commissioned a major in [[artillery]] in the Cuban Army and was killed in combat.  Osgood was inducted into the [[College Football Hall of Fame]] as a player in 1970.

==Early life==
Born in [[Fort Barrancas]], Florida, Osgood was one of five children of an [[United States Army|American army]] officer Henry Brown Osgood Jr. and his wife, Harriet Mary (Hubbard) Osgood.  Henry Osgood eventfully rose to the rank of [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]].<ref>[http://www.ftmac.org/Osgood-Farley.htm Fort MacArthur Museum]</ref>

==College athlete==
Osgood, nicknamed "Win", was one of the greatest college athletes of the 19th century.  He was talented in many sports but is best known for his exploits as an [[College Football All-America Team|All-American]] football player.  Osgood stood 5<U+2013>9, weighed 173, and was an elusive runner. [[Pudge Heffelfinger]], the legendary All-American from [[Yale University]], gave this description of Osgood: "It was downright uncanny to watch him run, opponents missed him by inches. His body undulated like a snake's. He was the [[Red Grange]] of the pioneer era."<ref name="CAN" />

===Cornell===
At Cornell, Osgood received a medal as the school's best all-around athlete. He ran the 440 and put the shot for the track team, was an accomplished [[Gymnastics|gymnast]], [[Boxing|boxer]], [[Wrestling|wrestler]], tennis player, and set a collegiate record of 5:28 for the 2-mile bicycle race.  Osgood played halfback for four years for the [[Cornell Big Red football|Cornell football team]], 1888<U+2013>1889 and 1891<U+2013>1992, during which time Cornell went 28<U+2013>8.<ref name="HOF">{{cite web | url=http://www.collegefootball.org/famersearch.php?id=90006 | title=Hall of fame biography|  accessdate=February 7, 2007}}</ref> Osgood was a considered one of the top players in the early years of Big Red football.   In an article on January 29, 1927, ''[[The Sun (New York)|The Sun]]'' named him to the first team of the all-time Cornell football team.<ref>[http://dspace.library.cornell.edu/bitstream/1813/3544/23/029_18.pdf Cornell Alumni News VOL. XXIX, No. 18  FEBRUARY 3, 1927]</ref>   Osgood also rowed on the varsity in 1890. In 1892, he was the single [[scull]] championship of the Cornell.<ref name=" CAN ">{{cite web | url=http://dspace.library.cornell.edu/bitstream/1813/3534/18/019_23.pdf | title= Cornell Alumni News VOL. XIX., No. 23 March 15, 1917 | publisher=Cornell University | accessdate=February 7, 2007 }}</ref> He left Cornell in the fall of 1892 to attend the [[University of Pennsylvania]].

===Pennsylvania===
At Pennsylvania, Osgood continued his exploits as a three sport athlete, excelling at football, track and field, and wrestling.  He lettered two seasons at halfback for the [[Penn Quakers football|Quakers]] under Hall of Fame coach [[George Washington Woodruff]].<ref>[http://www.pennathletics.net/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=1700&KEY=&ATCLID=518504&SPID=537&SPSID=60663 2006 University of Pennsylvania Football Media Guide], p. 145, accessed July 2, 2007</ref>  In his first year, he helped the 1893 Quakers to a 12<U+2013>3 record.  The team had a strong start, winning its first 11 games.  During that stretch, the defense only gave up 18 points while the offense scored 305 points.  But Penn lost three out of the last four games to perennial powers [[Harvard Crimson football|Harvard]], [[Yale Bulldogs football|Yale]] and [[Princeton Tigers football|Princeton]].<ref>2006 University of Pennsylvania Football Media Guide, p. 123,</ref> At the time Penn rarely beat the "Big Three", as they were known.   Osgood received widespread press in the 14<U+2013>6 loss to Yale, as he scored Penn<U+2019>s only touchdown in the game.<ref name="HOF" /> Yale had not been scored upon on for 35 straight games dating back to 1890, having amassed 1,355 unanswered points.<ref>Scott A. McQuilkin and Ronald A.

The 1894 squad featured one of the greatest backfields of all time, consisting of [[Carl Sheldon Williams]] at [[quarterback]], [[George Brooke (American football)|George Brooke]] at [[Fullback (American football)|fullback]], and Osgood and [[Alden Knipe]] at halfback.<ref>Allison Danzig, "Oh, How They Played the Game," (The Macmillan Company, 1971), p. 114, Library of Congress Catalog Card Number: 73-163227</ref> Osgood, Knipe and Brooke were all named to [[Walter Camp]]'s [[All-American]] first team that year.<ref>2006 University of Pennsylvania Football Media Guide, p. 135,</ref> The team was widely recognized as 1894's [[NCAA Division I FBS national football championship|football national champion]].   The highlight of the season was a 12<U+2013>0 victory over Princeton, only Penn's second win in 30 meetings with the Tigers, and an 18<U+2013>4 victory over Harvard.<ref>2006 University of Pennsylvania Football Media Guide, p. 137</ref>

===First college wrestling national champion===
Osgood also excelled at wrestling.  He became the first collegiate athlete to win a national championship when he won the 1895 National [[Amateur Athletic Union|AAU]] title in the "heavyweight" class (for competitors over 158 pounds).  At the time the sport was dominated by club teams.<ref name=" WHOF ">{{cite web | url=http://www.wrestlinghalloffame.org/history/wrestlinginusa.php | title= Wrestling Hall of Fame History| accessdate=February 7, 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070519153027/http://www.wrestlinghalloffame.org/history/wrestlinginusa.php <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = May 19, 2007}}</ref>

==Cuba<U+2019>s fight for independence==
When [[Cuba]] began its fight for independence from Spain, Osgood volunteered for the Cuban forces. He was commissioned a major in the artillery under General [[Calixto Garcia]]. Early in October 1896, the Cuban General Garcia  and General [[Maximo Gomez]] joined forces and moved upon Guimaro, which was strongly fortified and defended by the [[Spaniards]]. After much hard fighting and a brilliant charge led by  Colonel [[Mario Garc<U+00ED>a Menocal]], the largest fortification was taken.<ref name="CAN" /> During the battle, Major Osgood was in charge of shelling several blockhouses with a [[Hotchkiss gun|Hotchkiss rifle]] using 12-pound shells.   Osgood's artillery unit was under steady fire from small arms. When Osgood stooped over the gun to adjust the sight to account for the wind, he made the remark, <U+201C>think that will do.<U+201D>   At that moment, he was hit by a bullet fired by a sharp-shooter stationed in the church tower eleven hundred yards away. Osgood was carried from the location by his comrades and hurried down the hill to the aid station.  Without re-sighting the artillery piece, Osgood<U+2019>s second in command Major [[Frederick Funston]] gave the order to fire the gun and the shell hit one of the blockhouses.  The bullet that hit Osgood had gone through his brain and he did not recover from his wounds.<ref name=" CAN2 ">{{cite web | url=http://dspace.library.cornell.edu/bitstream/1813/3528/35/013_06.pdf | title= Cornell Alumni News Vol. XHL 'No. 6, November 2, 1910 | publisher=Cornell University | accessdate=February 7, 2007 }}</ref>
