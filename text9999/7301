The show runners for the seventh production season were [[Bill Oakley]] and [[Josh Weinstein]] who would executive produce 21 episodes this season.<ref name="Home"/> [[David Mirkin]] executive produced the remaining four, including two hold overs that were produced for the [[The Simpsons (season 6)|previous season]]. The season was nominated for two [[Primetime Emmy Awards]], including [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program (For Programming less than One Hour)|Outstanding Animated Program]] and won an [[Annie Award]] for Best Animated Television Program. The DVD box set was released in [[Region 1]] [[December 13]], [[2005]], [[Region 2]] [[January 30]], [[2006]] and Region 4 on [[March 29]], [[2006]].

==Production==
The season was the first season executive produced by [[Bill Oakley]] and [[Josh Weinstein]], who had written episodes for previous seasons. They were chosen partly because they had been with the show since the third season and understood many of its dynamics.<ref>{{cite video | people=Oakley, Bill; Weinstein, Josh|year=2007|title=The Simpsons season 9 Easter Egg DVD commentary for the episode "Lisa the Simpson"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> When they took over the series they wanted the many of the episodes to be realistic ones that focused more on the five members of the [[Simpson family]] and explored their feelings and emotions towards each other.<ref name="Oakley">{{cite video | people=Oakley, Bill|year=2005|title=The Simpsons season 7 DVD commentary for the episode "Home Sweet Homediddly-Dum-Doodily"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> They also wanted to produce a ''[[Treehouse of Horror (series)|Treehouse of Horror]]'' episode, episodes about [[Sideshow Bob]], [[The Itchy & Scratchy Show|Itchy & Scratchy]] and several "format-bending" episodes such as "[[22 Short Films About Springfield]]".<ref>{{cite video | people=Oakley, Bill|year=2005|title=The Simpsons season 7 DVD commentary for the episode "Homer the Smithers"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> Their preferred choice of guest stars were those with unique and interesting voices, and several of their guest stars were "old grizzled men with distinctive voices" such as [[R. Lee Ermey]], [[Donald Sutherland]], [[Kirk Douglas]] and [[Lawrence Tierney]].<ref>{{cite video | people=Oakley, Bill|year=2005|title=The Simpsons season 7 DVD commentary for the episode "Marge Be Not Proud"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> 

[[David Mirkin]], who had been executive producer for the previous two seasons, was credited as a consulting producer for the seventh season but also executive produced the episodes "[[Who Shot Mr. Burns? (Part Two)]]", "[[Radioactive Man (The Simpsons)|Radioactive Man]]", "[[Lisa the Vegetarian]]" and "[[Team Homer]]". [[Steve Tompkins]], [[Dan Greaney]], [[Richard Appel]] and [[Rachel Pulido]] received their first writing credits while [[Spike Feresten]] and Jack Barth received their only writing credits this season. Although the majority of the writing staff stayed on for the next season, both [[Greg Daniels]] and [[Brent Forrester]] received their last writing credits during season seven. [[Jon Vitti]], who had left following the [[The Simpsons (season 4)|fourth season]], returned to write "[[Home Sweet Homediddly-Dum-Doodily]]" as well as "[[The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular]]". [[Wes Archer]], a long-time director for ''The Simpsons'' who helped define the look of the show, left following this season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wesarcher.com/wes_archer_bio.html |title=Biography |publisher=WesArcher.com |accessdate=2008-03-22}}</ref> [[Dominic Polcino]] and [[Mike B.

[[Doris Grau]], script superviser for the show and voice of [[Springfield Elementary School#Lunchlady Doris|Lunchlady Doris]] died on [[December 30]], [[1995]]. The episode "[[Team Homer]]", which aired eight days later, was one of the last episodes to feature her voice and featured a dedication to her.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://movies.nytimes.com/person/28294/Doris-Grau/biography|title=Doris Grau - Full Biography|accessdate=2008-03-01|publisher=''[[New York Times]]''}}</ref> After that, Lunchlady Doris had speaking parts in "[[22 Short Films About Springfield]]" and "[[Lisa's Sax]]", which Grau had recorded before her death. From season nine until [[The Simpsons (season 18)|season eighteen]], she appeared only as a background character but had a speaking role in "[[The Mook, the Chef, the Wife and Her Homer]]" where she was voiced by [[Tress MacNeille]].

The season started off with the heavily publicized "[[Who Shot Mr. Burns? (Part Two)]]", which was the resolution to the [[Who Shot Mr. Burns? (Part One)|first part]], which had been a cliffhanger. It was preceded by "Springfield's Most Wanted", a TV special hosted by [[John Walsh]], host of ''[[America's Most Wanted]]'' and was parody of Walsh's television series, this special was designed to help people find out who shot Mr. Burns, by laying out the potential clues and identifying the possible suspects. The special was criticized for taking the publicity of the episode too far. Several critics said the special tainted Walsh's credibility and was described as gimmicky,<ref>{{cite news|title=A Simpsons `pseudo show' keeps him off edge of his seat |date=[[1995-09-07]]|accessdate=2008-02-09|page=3|publisher=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]|author=Tim Cuprisin}}</ref> tacky<ref>{{cite news|title=Fox gimmick triggers round of criticism |date=[[1995-09-08]]|accessdate=2008-02-09|page=3|publisher=[[The Tampa Tribune]]|author=Walt Belcher}}</ref> and "blatant groveling for viewers".<ref>{{cite news|title=Walsh joins 'Simpsons' hype |date=[[1995-09-15]]|accessdate=2008-02-09|page=11B|publisher=[[Dayton Daily News]]|author=Tom Hopkins}}</ref> The episode "[[Lisa the Vegetarian]]" features one of the few permanent character changes in the series when [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] officially becomes a vegetarian. The episode had been pitched by [[David X. Cohen|David S. Cohen]] and the producers felt it would be a surefire way to get [[Paul McCartney]] to guest star. McCartney agreed, but only on the condition that Lisa stay a vegetarian and not revert back.<ref>{{cite video | people=Mirkin, David|year=2005|title=The Simpsons season 7 DVD commentary for the episode "Lisa the Vegetarian"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> "[[22 Short Films About Springfield]]" has twelve credited writers, the most of any episode of the series. The episode features multiple stories about different characters. To decide who would write each of the segments, all of the writers chose their top three favorite characters and put them into a hat, the names were drawn out and the writers were assigned their parts and  [[Greg Daniels]] put all of the segments together and ordered them.<ref>{{cite video | people=Oakley, Bill|year=2006|title=The Simpsons The Complete Seventh Season DVD commentary for the episode "22 Short Films About Springfield"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> The only major character who was introduced this season was [[Disco Stu]], who appeared in "[[Two Bad Neighbors]]".<ref name="Stu"/> Two more episodes, "[[You Only Move Twice]]" and "[[El Viaje Misterioso de Nuestro Jomer (The Mysterious Voyage of Homer)|El Viaje Misterioso de Nuestro Jomer]]" were produced as part of the season seven (3Fxx) production run, but both aired [[The Simpsons (season 8)|the following season]].<ref>Richmond, p. 212</ref><ref>Richmond, pp. 220-221</ref>

==Awards==
In 1996, "[[Treehouse of Horror VI]]" was submitted for the [[Primetime Emmy Award]] in the "[[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program (For Programming less than One Hour)|Outstanding Animated Program (For Programming less than One Hour)]]" category.<ref name="Emmys">{{cite web|url=http://www.emmys.org/awards/awardsearch.php |title=Primetime Emmy Awards Advanced Search|publisher=Emmys.org|accessdate=2008-03-01}}</ref> They had submitted it because it had a 3D animation sequence, which the producers felt gave them an edge. However, the episode lost to ''[[Pinky and the Brain]]'' that year, and [[Bill Oakley]] later regretted submitting the episode because he felt that a more emotional episode like "[[Mother Simpson]]", "[[Lisa the Vegetarian]]" or "[[Bart Sells His Soul]]" would have had a better chance of winning.<ref>{{cite video | people=Oakley, Bill|year=2005|title=The Simpsons season 7 DVD commentary for the episode "Mother Simpson"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> [[Alf Clausen]], [[Bill Oakley]] and [[Josh Weinstein]] were also nominated for "Outstanding Individual Achievement in Music and Lyrics" for the song "S<U+1EBD>nor Burns" from "[[Who Shot Mr. Burns?
