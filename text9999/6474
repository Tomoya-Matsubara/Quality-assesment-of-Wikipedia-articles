James}}</ref>

==Career in Australia==
Moore arrived in [[Melbourne]] in January 1859.<ref name=Mennell/> He was soon appointed to the important pastorate of St. Francis' Church, Lonsdale Street, in that city, but, owing to failing health, took charge of the less onerous parish of Keilor. There he remained until 1865, when Archdeacon [[Laurence Sheil]] having been appointed [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Adelaide|Bishop of Adelaide]], Dr. Moore succeeded him as head of the Ballarat Mission in Victoria, being appointed dean, and accompanying Archbishop [[James Alipius Goold]] to Rome in 1873, when [[Pope Pius IX]] made him [[Doctor of Divinity]].<ref name=Mennell/> On the erection of Ballarat into a separate diocese he was appointed Vicar-General, and on the death of Bishop O'Connor, in 1883, the Pope, who had made him one of his domestic prelates and a monsignor in 1881, first named him administrator of the diocese, and then nominated him to the succession. He was consecrated on 27 April 1884.<ref name=Mennell/>
