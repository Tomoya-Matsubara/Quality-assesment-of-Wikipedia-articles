'''''Maximum Rocknroll''''' is an album by [[NOFX]] that compiles early singles and demo songs. It was released without the band's consent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fatwreck.com/store/detail/Mystic%20CD%20180 |title=NOFX :: Maximum Rocknroll - Records: Fat Wreck Chords |publisher=Fatwreck.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-11}}</ref>
''Maximum Rocknroll'' was originally released on [[compact audio cassette|cassette]] in 1989<ref name="nofxwiki.net" /> by [[Mystic Records]] and again three years later on [[Gramophone record|LP]] and [[Compact Disc|CD]].

When the original cassette was released in 1989, it was released under a different title, '''''E is for Everything''''', though the track listing was identical to the other formats. ''E is for Everything'' is currently out of print. The tape also had a different cover, similar to the band's 1985 [[NOFX (EP)|self-titled EP]] which depicts a skull with a syringe. The cover of the 1992 version depicts [[Fat Mike]] playing his bass.

Fat Mike stated that "This was never supposed to be a record. NOFX got popular in the mid 90's so mystic records took both seven inchers and put them out on a cd with a bunch of demo songs. It's a totally sucky record and the artwork totally bites. We had no control over any of it. In fact we didn't know it was coming out until I saw one in a store. If you want to hear a totally crappy fucked album then this is the one for you. Don't say I didn't warn you."<ref name="nofxwiki.net" />

Even though the band claims that ''Maximum Rocknroll'' was not released with their consent, it's listed on the discography of their website.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nofxofficialwebsite.com/albums/albums.html |title=Albums // NOFX |publisher=Nofxofficialwebsite.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-11}}</ref>
