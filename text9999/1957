==Club career==

Born in [[Barrow-in-Furness]], [[Cumbria]], Pelter emigrated with his family to [[New Zealand]] at the age of eight and entered the New Zealand Football Academy whilst twelve years old.<ref name="globetrotting">{{Cite web|url=http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/the-big-interview/Globetrotting-Jack39s-so-Keane-to.3061507.jp|title=Globetrotting Jack's so Keane to impress Roy|accessdate=2008-01-01|date=26 July 2007|publisher=[[Yorkshire Evening Post]]|author=Ben Frampton}}</ref> He exhibited a love for football in his school work, writing an essay on his personal hero [[Roy Keane]],<ref name="globetrotting"/> whilst also supporting English team [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]].<ref name=newzealand>{{cite web |url=http://www.nzsoccer.com/page/nz_u20_men_jack_pelter.html |title=NZ U20 Men - Jack Pelter |publisher=nzfootball.co.nz |accessdate=12 Sep 2007}}</ref> He went on to play in the [[New Zealand National Soccer League|National Soccer League]] for [[Christchurch Technical]], [[Ferrymead Bays]] and [[Central United]].

After recovering from a serious back injury on his return, Pelter moved to [[New Zealand Football Championship]] team [[Canterbury United]] in 2005.<ref name="realise dream"/> Due to the [[semi-professional]] nature of football in New Zealand, Pelter had to take on other jobs to finance his football regime, with his mother later commenting "After training, he'd go to work in a bar until two in the morning to fund his career, he was running, training and swimming on his own, he used to get up on cold mornings on his own to go running".<ref name="globetrotting"/>

The winner of Canterbury United's "Defender of the Year" award and runner-up for "Player of the Year" in only his first season with the club, Pelter subsequently attracted the attention of European clubs in 2007 following his international progress.
