'''Tharon Leslie "Pat" Collins''' (September 13, 1896 <U+2013> May 20, 1960) was an American [[baseball]] [[catcher]] who played ten seasons in [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB). He played for the [[Baltimore Orioles|St. Louis Browns]], [[New York Yankees]] and [[Atlanta Braves|Boston Braves]] from 1919 to 1929.  He batted and threw [[right-handed]] and also played five games at [[First baseman|first base]].

Collins played [[minor league baseball]] for the [[Joplin Miners]] until 1919, when he signed with the St. Louis Browns.  After spending six seasons with the organization, Collins spent a one year sojourn in the minor leagues before he was traded to the New York Yankees, where he spent the next three years and played in the famous 1927 [[Murderers' Row]] lineup.  At the conclusion of the 1928 season, he was traded to the Boston Braves, with whom he played his last game on May 23, 1929.  A two-time [[World Series]] champion, he is famous for being the only major league player to [[Pinch hitter|pinch hit]] and [[Pinch runner|pinch run]] in the same game.

===St. Louis Browns (1919<U+2013>1924)===
Collins made his major league debut for the Browns on September 5, 1919, at the age of 22,<ref name=BR/> entering the game as a [[pinch-hitter]] for [[pitcher]] [[Bert Gallia]] and drawing a [[Base on balls|walk]] in a 12<U+2013>3 loss against the [[Detroit Tigers]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/DET/DET191909050.shtml|title=September 5, 1919 St. Louis Browns at Detroit Tigers Play by Play and Box Score|work=Baseball-Reference.com|publisher=Sports Reference|date=September 5, 1919|accessdate=August 24, 2013}}</ref>  Between 1920 and 1922, he never played more than 31 games nor started more than 20 games a season as catcher, and his role was limited to occasional pinch-hitting appearances.<ref name=BR/>

His teammate [[Homer Ezzell]] reached base in the third inning, but needed to use the restroom.  Collins was inserted into the game as a pinch runner until Ezzell returned.  In the ninth inning, Collins returned to pinch hit for pitcher [[Ray Kolp]] after the [[1923 Philadelphia Athletics season|Philadelphia Athletics]]' manager [[Connie Mack]] agreed to drop the no [[free substitution]] rule and allowed Collins to pinch hit.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=Kss2NdawNcUC&pg=PA109&dq=pat+collins+pinch+hit+and+pinch+run+in+same+game&hl=en&sa=X&ei=yzwLUtPxJfCziQeLsYGIDA&ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=pat%20collins%20pinch%20hit%20and%20pinch%20run%20in%20same%20game&f=false|title=This Day in Baseball: A Day-by-day Record of the Events that Shaped the Game|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|year=2008|last1=Nemec|first1=David|last2=Flatow|first2=Scott|pages=109|accessdate=August 24, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Nolan is KC's Mr. Amateur Baseball|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=KC&p_theme=kc&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EAF45CEEFB16A58&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|date=June 20, 1998|accessdate=August 24, 2013|page=D2|first=Rich|last=Sambol|newspaper=The Kansas City Star}} '''{{subscription required}}</ref>  However, the official [[Box score (baseball)|box score]] lists his pinch hit appearance only.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/PHA/PHA192306080.shtml|title=June 8, 1923 St. Louis Browns at Philadelphia Athletics Play by Play and Box Score|work=Baseball-Reference.com|publisher=Sports Reference|date=June 8, 1923|accessdate=August 24, 2013}}</ref>
