'''"Say Say Say"''' is a song by [[Michael Jackson]] and [[Paul McCartney]]. The track was written by the duo, and produced by [[George Martin]] for McCartney's fifth solo album, ''[[Pipes of Peace]]'' (1983). The song was the pair's second duet, following "[[The Girl Is Mine]]" for Jackson's ''[[Thriller (album)|Thriller]]'' (1982). Recorded at the same time as McCartney's ''[[Tug of War (album)|Tug of War]]'' album, the single became Jackson's seventh top ten hit in a year upon its release in October, 1983. "Say Say Say" was a number one hit in the US and peaked at number two in the UK. Number one in Canada, Finland, Italy, Norway and Sweden, the single peaked within the top ten of Austria and New Zealand.

[[music recording sales certification|Certified]] platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]], the song was promoted with a [[music video]] directed by [[Bob Giraldi]]. The video, filmed in [[Santa Ynez Valley]], [[California]], featured cameo appearances by [[Linda McCartney]], [[LaToya Jackson]] and [[Mr. T]]. The short film centered around two [[con artists]], "Mack and Jack", and introduced dialogue and storylines to music videos. Upon its release, the video was considered too violent by the National Coalition of Television Violence. "Say Say Say" was covered by the Dutch music group [[Hi-Tack]] in early 2006. They took the song to number four on the [[UK singles chart]]. 

==Recording==
Prior to recording "Say Say Say", McCartney had collaborated with Jackson on "[[The Girl Is Mine]]", for Jackson's ''[[Thriller (album)|Thriller]]'' album. In return, Jackson agreed to record "Say Say Say" for McCartney's ''[[Pipes of Peace]]''.<ref>Stephen Thomas Erlewine & William Ruhlmann. [http://www.mtv.com/music/artist/mccartney_paul/artist.jhtml "Paul McCartney biography"]. [[MTV]]. Retrieved on March 3, 2009.</ref> The song was recorded at [[Abbey Road Studios]] from May to September, 1981. During this time, McCartney was also recording ''[[Tug of War (album)|Tug of War]]'', his first solo album since splitting from the [[Wings (band)|Wings]].<ref name="halstead 268">Halstead, p. 268</ref> Jackson stayed at the home of McCartney and his wife [[Linda McCartney|Linda]] during the recording sessions, becoming friendly with both. One evening whilst at the dining table, McCartney brought out a booklet displaying all the songs he owned the publishing rights to. "This is the way to make big money", the musician told Jackson. "Every time someone records one of these songs, I get paid. Every time someone plays these songs on the radio, or in live performances, I get paid". McCartney's words later influenced Jackson's purchase of the [[Northern Songs]] song catalogue in 1985.<ref name="tara 333">Taraborrelli, p. 333</ref> The recording of "Say Say Say" was completed in February, 1983. [[George Martin]], who had worked with [[The Beatles]], produced "Say Say Say". He said of Jackson, "He actually does radiate an aura when he comes into the studio, there's no question about it. He's not a musician in the sense that Paul is...but he does know what he wants in music and he has very firm ideas".<ref name="halstead 268"/>

==Release and reception==
Following the release of ''Thriller'' and its accompanying singles, "Say Say Say" was released on October 9, 1983.<ref name="halstead 269">Halstead, p. 269</ref> Remaining atop the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'''s Hot 100]] for six weeks, the single was Jackson's seventh top ten hit in a year<U+2014>breaking a record previously held by The Beatles and [[Elvis Presley]].<ref name="Campbell 68">Campbell, p. 68</ref> It was also Jackson's third single to top the Hot 100; "Say Say Say", "[[Billie Jean]]" and "[[Beat It]]" logged Jackson sixteen combined weeks at the top.

An interview was then held with McCartney, who discussed the song's music video. The interview helped propel the song to number two on the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref name="Barrow 92">Barrow, p. 92</ref> Screenings of the video on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' (who usually only screened videos within the Top 40), ''[[The Tube (TV series)|The Tube]]'' and [[Noel Edmonds]]' ''[[The Late, Late Breakfast Show]]'' also aided the song's UK chart performance. Reaching number one in Canada, Finland, Italy, Norway and Sweden, the single was also within the top ten of Austria and New Zealand.<ref name="Barrow 92"/><ref name="halstead 269"/><ref name="austria"/>
