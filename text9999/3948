The '''asteroid belt''' is the region of the [[Solar System]] located roughly between the orbits of the [[planet]]s [[Mars]] and [[Jupiter]]. It is occupied by numerous irregularly shaped bodies called [[asteroid]]s or [[minor planet]]s. The asteroid belt region is also termed the '''main asteroid belt''' or '''main belt''' because there are other asteroids in the solar system such as [[near-Earth asteroids]] and [[trojan asteroids]]. 
More than half the mass of the main belt is contained in the four largest objects: [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], [[4 Vesta]], [[2 Pallas]], and [[10 Hygiea]]. These have mean diameters of more than 400&nbsp;km, while Ceres, the main belt's only [[dwarf planet]], is about 950&nbsp;km in diameter.<ref name="Krasinskyetal2002" /><ref name="Pitjeva2005" /><ref name="halfmass" /><ref name="jplsbdb">{{cite web

}}</ref> The remaining bodies range down to the size of a dust particle. The asteroid material is so thinly distributed that multiple unmanned spacecraft have traversed it without incident. Nonetheless, collisions between large asteroids do occur, and these can form an [[asteroid family]] whose members have similar orbital characteristics and compositions. Collisions also produce a fine dust that forms a major component of the [[zodiacal light]]. Individual asteroids within the main belt are categorized by their [[spectrum|spectra]], with most falling into three basic groups: [[carbon]]aceous ([[C-type asteroid|C-type]]), [[silicate]] ([[S-type asteroid|S-type]]), and metal-rich ([[M-type asteroid|M-type]]). 

The asteroid belt formed from the primordial [[solar nebula]] as a group of [[planetesimal]]s, the smaller precursors of the planets, which in turn formed [[protoplanet]]s. Between Mars and Jupiter, however, [[gravity|gravitational]] perturbations from the giant planet imbued the protoplanets with too much orbital energy for them to [[accretion (astrophysics)|accrete]] into a planet. Collisions became too violent, and instead of sticking together, the planetesimals and most of the protoplanets shattered. As a result, most of the main belt's mass has been lost since the formation of the Solar System. Some fragments can eventually find their way into the inner Solar System, leading to meteorite impacts with the inner planets. Asteroid orbits continue to be appreciably [[Perturbation (astronomy)|perturbed]] whenever their period of revolution about the Sun forms an [[orbital resonance]] with Jupiter. At these orbital distances, a [[Kirkwood gap]] occurs as they are swept into other orbits.

Other regions of [[small solar system bodies]] include the [[Centaur (planetoid)|centaurs]], the [[Kuiper belt]] and [[scattered disk]], and the [[Oort cloud]].

If one began a numerical sequence at 0, then included 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, etc., doubling each time, and added four to each number and divided by 10, this produced a remarkably close approximation to the orbits of the known planets as measured in [[astronomical units]]. This pattern, now known as the [[Titius-Bode Law]], predicted the [[Semi-major axis|semi-major axes]] of the six planets of the time (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn) provided one allowed for a "gap" between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. In his footnote Titius declared, "But should the Lord Architect have left that space empty? Not at all".<ref name="Dawn" /> In 1768, the astronomer [[Johann Elert Bode]] made note of Titius's relationship in his ''Anleitung zur Kenntniss des gestirnten Himmels'' (English: ''Instruction for the Knowledge of the Starry Heavens'') but did not credit Titius, which led many to refer to it as "Bode's law".<ref name="Hoskin" /> When [[William Herschel]] discovered [[Uranus]] in 1781, the planet's position matched the law almost perfectly, leading astronomers to conclude that there had to be a planet between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter.

In 1800, astronomer Baron [[Franz Xaver von Zach]] recruited 24 of his fellows into an informal club he dubbed the "Lilienthal Society". Determined to bring the Solar System to order, the group became known as the "Himmelspolizei", or Celestial Police. Notable members included Herschel, British astronomer Royal [[Nevil Maskelyne]], [[Charles Messier]], and [[Heinrich Olbers]].<ref name="police">{{cite journal|title=Call the police!

|accessdate=2007-11-11}}</ref>

Only a few months later, a non-member of the Celestial Police confirmed their expectations. On January 1, 1801, [[Giuseppe Piazzi]], Chair of Astronomy at the [[University of Palermo]], [[Sicily]], found a tiny moving object in the exact location predicted by the Titius-Bode Law. He dubbed it [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], after the [[Ceres (Roman mythology)|Roman goddess]] of the harvest and patron of Sicily. Piazzi initially believed it a comet, but its lack of a [[Coma (cometary)|coma]] suggested it was a planet.<ref name="police" /> Fifteen months later, Olbers discovered a second object in the same region, [[2 Pallas|Pallas]]. Unlike the other known planets, the objects remained points of light even under the highest telescope magnifications, rather than resolving into discs. Apart from their rapid movement, they were indistinguishable from [[star]]s. Accordingly, in 1802 William Herschel suggested they be placed into a separate category, named ''asteroids,'' after the [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] ''asteroeides'', meaning "star-like".<ref>{{cite web

The discovery of [[Neptune]] in 1846 led to the discrediting of the Titius-Bode Law in the eyes of scientists, as its orbit was nowhere near the predicted position.

The expression "asteroid belt" comes into use in the very early 1850s, although it is hard to pinpoint who coined the term. The first English use seems to be in the 1850 translation (by E. C.

=== Formation ===
In 1802, shortly after discovering Pallas, [[Heinrich Olbers]] suggested to [[William Herschel]] that Ceres and Pallas were [[Phaeton (hypothetical planet)|fragments of a much larger planet]] that once occupied the Mars-Jupiter region, this planet having suffered an internal explosion or a cometary impact many million years before.<ref>{{cite web|title=A Brief History of Asteroid Spotting|work=Open2.net|url=http://www.open2.net/sciencetechnologynature/planetsbeyond/asteroids/history.html|accessdate=2007-05-15}}</ref> Over time, however, this hypothesis has fallen from favor. The large amount of energy that would have been required to destroy a planet, combined with the belt's low combined mass, which is only about 4% of the mass of the Earth's [[Moon]], do not support the hypothesis. Further, the significant chemical differences between the asteroids are difficult to explain if they come from the same planet.<ref>{{cite web

In general in the Solar System, [[planetary formation]] is thought to have occurred via a process comparable to the long-standing nebular hypothesis: a cloud of interstellar dust and gas collapsed under the influence of gravity to form a rotating disk of material that then further condensed to form the Sun and planets.<ref>{{cite web

During the early history of the Solar System, the asteroids melted to some degree, allowing elements within them to be partially or completely differentiated by mass. Some of the progenitor bodies may even have undergone periods of explosive [[volcanism]] and formed [[magma]] oceans. However, because of the relatively small size of the bodies, the period of melting was necessarily brief (compared to the much larger planets), and had generally ended about 4.5&nbsp;billion years ago, in the first tens of millions of years of formation.<ref>{{cite journal

The current asteroid belt is believed to contain only a small fraction of the mass of the primordial belt. Computer simulations suggest that the original asteroid belt may have contained mass equivalent to the Earth. Primarily because of gravitational perturbations, most of the material was ejected from the belt within about a million years of formation, leaving behind less than 0.1% of the original mass.<ref name="icarus153" /> Since their formation, the size distribution of the asteroid belt has remained relatively stable: there has been no significant increase or decrease in the typical dimensions of the main-belt asteroids.<ref>{{cite news

===Main-belt comets===
{{main|Main-belt comet}}
Several otherwise unremarkable bodies in the outer belt show [[comet]]ary activity. Since their orbits cannot be explained through capture of classical comets, it is thought that many of the outer asteroids may be icy, with the ice occasionally exposed to sublimation through small impacts. Main-belt comets may have been a major source of the Earth's oceans, since the deuterium-hydrogen ratio is too low for classical comets to have been the principal source.<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1W4NTmI5Bk Interview with David Jewitt]</ref>

===Orbits and rotations===
[[Image:Main belt e vs a.png|thumb|300px|right|The asteroid belt (showing eccentricities), with the main belt in red and blue ("core" region in red)]]
Most asteroids within the main belt have orbital eccentricities of less than 0.4, and an inclination of less than 30<U+00B0>. The orbital distribution of the asteroids reaches a maximum at an eccentricity of around 0.07 and an inclination below 4<U+00B0>.<ref name="mpc">{{cite web

}}</ref> Thus while a typical asteroid has a relatively circular orbit and lies near the plane of the [[ecliptic]], some asteroid orbits can be highly eccentric or travel well outside the ecliptic plane.

Sometimes, the term ''main belt'' is used to refer only to the more compact "core" region where the greatest concentration of bodies is found. This lies between the strong 4:1 and 2:1 [[Kirkwood gap]]s at 2.06 and 3.27 [[astronomical unit|AU]], and at [[eccentricity (orbit)|orbital eccentricities]] less than roughly 0.33, along with orbital [[inclination]]s below about 20<U+00B0>. This "core" region contains approximately 93.4% of all numbered minor planets within the Solar System.<ref name="basedon1">This value was obtained by a simple count up of all bodies in that region using data for 120437 numbered minor planets from the [http://www.minorplanetcenter.org/iau/MPCORB.html Minor Planet Center orbit database], dated February 8, 2006.</ref>

Measurements of the rotation rates of large asteroids in the main belt show that there is an upper limit. No asteroid with a diameter larger than 100 meters has a period of rotation faster than 2.2 hours. For asteroids rotating faster than approximately this rate, the inertia at the surface is greater than the gravitational force, so any loose surface material would be flung out. However, a solid object should be able to rotate much more rapidly. This suggests that most asteroids with a diameter over 100 metres are [[rubble pile]]s formed through accumulation of debris after collisions between asteroids.<ref>{{cite web

The [[semi-major axis]] of an asteroid is used to describe the dimensions of its orbit around the Sun, and its value determines the minor planet's [[orbital period]]. In 1866, [[Daniel Kirkwood]] announced the discovery of gaps in the distances of these bodies' orbits from the [[Sun]]. They were located at positions where their period of revolution about the Sun was an integer fraction of Jupiter's orbital period. Kirkwood proposed that the gravitational perturbations of the planet led to the removal of asteroids from these orbits.<ref>{{cite journal

The gaps are not seen in a simple snapshot of the locations of the asteroids at any one time because asteroid orbits are elliptical, and many asteroids still cross through the radii corresponding to the gaps. The actual spatial density of asteroids in these gaps does not differ significantly from the neighboring regions.<ref name="mnras244" />

The main gaps occur at the 3:1, 5:2, 7:3, and 2:1 mean-motion resonances with Jupiter. An asteroid in the 3:1 Kirkwood gap would orbit the Sun three times for each Jovian orbit, for instance. Weaker resonances occur at other semi-major axis values, with fewer asteroids found than nearby. (For example, an 8:3 resonance for asteroids with a semi-major axis of 2.71 AU.)<ref name="iau160">{{cite conference

The main or core population of the asteroid belt is sometimes divided into three zones, based on the most prominent Kirkwood gaps. Zone I lies between the 4:1 resonance (2.06 AU) and 3:1 resonance (2.5 AU) Kirkwood gaps. Zone II continues from the end of Zone I out to the 5:2 resonance gap (2.82 AU). Zone III extends from the outer edge of Zone II to the 2:1 resonance gap (3.28 AU).<ref>{{cite journal | last=Klacka

The main belt may also be divided into the inner and outer belts, with the inner belt formed by asteroids orbiting nearer to Mars than the 3:1 Kirkwood gap (2.5&nbsp;AU), and the outer belt formed by those asteroids closer to Jupiter's orbit. (Some authors subdivide the inner and outer belts at the 2:1 resonance gap (3.3 AU), while others suggest inner, middle, and outer belts.)

==Collisions==
[[Image:zodiacal.jpg|thumb|200 px|The [[zodiacal light]], created in part by dust from collisions in the asteroid belt]]
The high population of the main belt makes for a very active environment, where collisions between asteroids occur frequently (on astronomical time scales).

Conversely, collisions that occur at low relative speeds may also join two asteroids. After more than 4 billion years of such processes, the members of the asteroid belt now bear little resemblance to the original population.

Along with the asteroid bodies, the main belt also contains bands of dust with particle radii of up to a few hundred [[micrometre]]s. This fine material is produced, at least in part, from collisions between asteroids, and by the impact of micrometeorites upon the asteroids. Due to the [[Poynting-Robertson effect]], the pressure of [[solar radiation]] causes this dust to slowly spiral inward toward the [[Sun]].<ref name="apj392">{{cite journal

The combination of this fine asteroid dust, as well as ejected cometary material, produces the [[zodiacal light]]. This faint auroral glow can be viewed at night extending from the direction of the [[Sun]] along the plane of the [[ecliptic]]. Particles that produce the visible zodiacal light average about 40&nbsp;<U+03BC>m in radius. The typical lifetimes of such particles are about 700,000&nbsp;years.

Approximately one-third of the asteroids in the main belt are members of an asteroid family. These share similar orbital elements, such as semi-major axis, eccentricity, and orbital inclination as well as similar spectral features, all of which indicate a common origin in the breakup of a larger body. Graphical displays of these elements, for members of the main belt, show concentrations indicating the presence of an asteroid family. There are about 20&ndash;30 associations that are almost certainly asteroid families. Additional groupings have been found that are less certain. Asteroid families can be confirmed when the members display common spectral features.<ref>{{cite conference

The largest asteroid to be a true member of a family (as opposed to an interloper in the case of Ceres with the [[Gefion family]]) is 4 Vesta. The [[Vesta family]] is believed to have formed as the result of a crater-forming impact on Vesta. Likewise, the [[HED meteorite]]s may also have originated from Vesta as a result of this collision.<ref>{{cite journal

Three prominent bands of dust have been found within the main belt. These have similar orbital inclinations as the Eos, Koronis, and Themis asteroid families, and so are possibly associated with those groupings.<ref>{{cite journal

===Periphery===
Skirting the inner edge of the belt (ranging between 1.78 and 2.0 AU, with a mean semi-major axis of 1.9&nbsp;AU) is the [[Hungaria family]] of minor planets. They are named after the main member, [[434 Hungaria]]; the group contains at least 52 named asteroids. The Hungaria group is separated from the main body by the 4:1 Kirkwood gap and their orbits have a high inclination. Some members belong to the Mars-crossing category of asteroids, and gravitational perturbations by Mars are likely a factor in reducing the total population of this group.<ref>{{cite journal

Another high-inclination group in the inner part of the main belt is the [[Phocaea family]]. These are composed primarily of S-type asteroids, whereas the neighboring Hungaria family includes some [[E-type asteroid|E-types]].<ref>{{cite journal

Skirting the outer edge of the main belt is the [[65 Cybele|Cybele group]], orbiting between 3.3 and 3.5&nbsp;AU. These have a 7:4 orbital resonance with Jupiter. The [[Hilda family]] orbit between 3.5 and 4.2&nbsp;AU, and have relatively circular orbits and a stable 3:2 orbital resonance with Jupiter. There are few asteroids beyond 4.2&nbsp;AU, until Jupiter's orbit. Here the two families of [[Trojan asteroid]]s can be found, which, at least for objects larger than 1&nbsp;km, are approximately as numerous as the asteroids of the main belt.<ref>{{cite book

===New families===
Some asteroid families have formed recently, in astronomical terms. The [[Karin Cluster]] apparently formed about 5.7 million years ago from a collision with a 33&nbsp;km radius progenitor asteroid.<ref>{{cite journal

In the more distant past, the [[1270 Datura|Datura cluster]] appears to have formed about 450 thousand years ago from a collision with a main-belt asteroid. The age estimate is based on the probability of the members having their current orbits, rather than from any physical evidence. However, this cluster may have been a source for some zodiacal dust material.<ref>{{cite journal

==Exploration==
[[Image:Dawn Flight Configuration 2.jpg|right|thumb|320px|Artist's concept of the [[Dawn Mission]] spacecraft with [[Vesta family|Vesta]] (left) and [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]] (right)]]
The first spacecraft to traverse the asteroid belt was [[Pioneer 10]], which entered the region on July 16, 1972. At the time there was some concern that the debris in the belt would pose a hazard to the spacecraft, but it has since been safely traversed by 9 Earth-based craft without incident. [[Pioneer 11]], [[Voyager program|Voyagers 1 and 2]] and [[Ulysses probe|Ulysses]] passed through the belt without imaging any asteroids. [[Galileo (spacecraft)|Galileo]] imaged the asteroid [[951 Gaspra]] in 1991 and [[243 Ida]] in 1993, [[NEAR Shoemaker|NEAR]] imaged [[253 Mathilde]] in 1997, [[Cassini<U+2013>Huygens|Cassini]] imaged [[2685 Masursky]] in 2000, [[Stardust (spacecraft)|Stardust]] imaged [[5535 Annefrank]] in 2002, [[New Horizons]] imaged [[132524 APL]] in 2006, and [[Rosetta (spacecraft)|Rosetta]] imaged [[2867 <U+0160>teins]] in 2008.<ref>{{cite journal

All spacecraft images of belt asteroids to date have come from brief [[planetary flyby|flyby]] opportunities by probes headed for other targets. Only the NEAR and [[Hayabusa]] missions have studied asteroids for a protracted period in orbit and at the surface and these were [[near-Earth asteroid]]s. However, the [[Dawn Mission]] has been dispatched to explore [[4 Vesta|Vesta]] and [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]] in the main belt. If the probe is still operational after examining these two large bodies, an extended mission is possible that could allow additional exploration.<ref>{{cite web
