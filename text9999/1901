'''John Lloyd Waddy''' [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]], [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|DFC]] (10 December 1916 <U+2013> 11&nbsp;September 1987) was a senior officer and aviator in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF), who later served as a member of the [[New South Wales Legislative Assembly]] and [[Minister of the Crown]]. As a fighter pilot during [[Military history of Australia during World War II|World War II]], he shot down fifteen enemy aircraft in the [[Western Desert Campaign|Desert War]], becoming one of Australia's top-scoring [[Flying ace|aces]] and earning the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]]. He went on to command [[No. 80 Squadron RAAF|No.&nbsp;80 Squadron]] in the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|South West Pacific]], where he was awarded the US [[Air Medal]]. He was also one of eight senior pilots who took part in the "[[Morotai Mutiny]]" of April 1945. 

Discharged from the Permanent Air Force at the end of the war, Waddy took a commission in the RAAF Reserve, leading the organisation as a [[group captain]] in the early 1950s. He was active in business and in veterans' groups, and was appointed an [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] in 1955. As the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]] [[Electoral district of Kirribilli|Member for Kirribilli]] from 1962 to 1976, he held cabinet posts in the [[New South Wales Parliament]], including Minister for Child Welfare and Social Welfare (later Youth and Community Services), [[Minister for Health (New South Wales)|Minister for Health]], and [[Minister for Police and Emergency Services (New South Wales)|Minister for Police]] and [[Minister for Police and Emergency Services (New South Wales)|Services]]. He retired from politics in 1976, and died in 1987 at the age of seventy.

==Family and early life==
Born in Sydney on 10&nbsp;December 1916, Waddy was the son of [[first-class cricket]]er Edgar Lloyd Waddy and his wife Lottchen, and great-grandson of General Sir Richard Waddy [[Order of the Bath|KCB]].<ref name="Who's Who 1980">Draper, ''Who's Who in Australia 1980'', p. 840</ref><ref name="Who's Who 1950">Alexander, ''Who's Who in Australia 1950'', p. 724</ref> His four siblings included a sister and three brothers.<ref name="Legislative Assembly"/> Edgar Waddy established the real estate firm of E.L.&nbsp;Waddy & Son in [[Rose Bay, New South Wales|Rose Bay]], which John joined as a clerk after completing his education at [[The King's School, Parramatta]].<ref name="Who's Who 1950"/><ref name="Newton">Newton, ''Australian Air Aces'', pp. 114<U+2013>115</ref> He married Vera Nellie May (Ve) Dengate on 21&nbsp;July 1938; the couple had a son, Lloyd, and two daughters, Denise and Rosalind.<ref name="Who's Who 1980"/><ref name="Ve Waddy obit">"[http://www.smh.com.au/news/obituaries/her-name-on-a-war-plane-says-it-all/2006/06/29/1151174327898.html Her name on a war plane says it all]" at ''[http://www.smh.com.au/ The Sydney Morning Herald]''.

Waddy enlisted in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) in late 1940, learning to fly under the [[Commonwealth Air Training Plan|Empire Air Training Scheme]] (EATS) in [[Rhodesia]]. His two older brothers, Edgar and Richard, were also pilots. Edgar had taken a short-service commission with the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) in the 1930s, while Richard trained in Canada with EATS during the war prior to active duty in Britain, where he was killed flying a single-engined [[Fighter aircraft|fighter]] in 1941.<ref name="Legislative Assembly"/><ref name="Newton"/> Waddy's elder sister, Lett, was commissioned into the Women's Volunteer Naval Reserve, and his younger brother Rowen served as an officer with [[Z Special Unit]] in the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|South West Pacific]].<ref name="Legislative Assembly"/>

==World War II==

Completing his training in June 1941, [[Pilot Officer]] Waddy was posted to the [[North African Campaign|North African theatre]] with [[No. 250 Squadron RAF|No.&nbsp;250 (Fighter) Squadron RAF]], operating [[Curtiss P-40 variants|P-40]] Tomahawks and, later, Kittyhawks.<ref name="Newton"/> He was befriended and mentored by the RAAF's top-scoring [[Flying ace|ace]], [[Clive Caldwell|Clive "Killer" Caldwell]], who became godfather to Waddy's daughter.<ref name="Alexander">Alexander, "Cleaning the Augean stables"</ref> Waddy's first operational [[sortie]] was as Caldwell's [[wingman]]; he found the ensuing dogfight so fast and confusing that he had no idea what was happening and afterwards had to ask the more experienced pilot how things had gone.<ref>Alexander, ''Clive Caldwell: Air Ace'', p. 56</ref> On 9&nbsp;December, however, he registered his first victory<U+2014>in a Tomahawk that had previously been Caldwell's personal mount<U+2014>when he shared in the destruction of a [[Messerschmitt Bf&nbsp;110]] twin-engined fighter near [[Gamal Abdul El Nasser Air Base|El Adem]].<ref>Newton, ''Clash of Eagles'', p. 60</ref><ref>Thomas, ''Tomahawk and Kittyhawk Aces of the RAF and Commonwealth'', p. 107</ref> 

By the end of April 1942, Waddy had scored four-and-a-half victories over enemy aircraft. Promoted [[flying officer]], he achieved four "kills" in a single sortie on 12&nbsp;May 1942, destroying two [[Junkers Ju&nbsp;52]] cargo planes and two escorting Bf&nbsp;110s from a German air transport convoy operating between [[Crete]] and North Africa.<ref name="Newton"/><ref>Herington, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/28/chapters/10.pdf ''Air War Against Germany and Italy''], p. 231</ref> He was awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] (DFC) for this action, [[London Gazette|gazetted]] on 2&nbsp;October.

He claimed a further three victories with his latest unit before being posted back to Australia on 19&nbsp;November 1942.
