|'''IDF'''
*The IDF reveals that 15 reserve soldiers were killed and 40 were wounded in clashes on August 9, Israel's deadliest day of fighting since the war began. <ref>[http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1154525841832&pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull "15 IDF soldiers killed Wednesday, IDF reveals"], ''[[Jerusalem Post]]'', [[August 10]], [[2006]]</ref> In fighting in the villages of [[Marjayoun]], [[Khiam]] and [[Kila]], eight Israeli soldiers were wounded in a mortar attack. Another soldier was lightly hurt by anti-tank rocket fire. One soldier was also wounded by anti-tank fire in the the security zone near [[Bint Jbail]] <ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/748556.html "IDF suffers casualties in fighting near Marj Ayoun"], ''[[Haaretz]]'', [[August 10]], [[2006]]</ref>.
* As cease-fire negotiations appeared to stall, Israel lobbed artillery rounds into southern Lebanon at daybreak while troops backed by tanks and armored vehicles moved across the border. Israel ratcheted up its fight against Hezbollah, beginning operations aimed at the heart of [[Beirut]], taking control of a largely [[Christ]]ian southern Lebanese town. The Israeli military also dropped leaflets in Beirut, warning of expanded operations inside the capital and urging people in southern [[Shi'a Islam|Shiite]] neighborhoods to evacuate. Those neighborhoods have been bastions of support for Hezbollah. "To the people who live in [[Hay El Soulom]], [[Borj El Barajneh]], [[Chyah|Shiyah]] ... For your safety," one flier warned. "You must evacuate these areas immediately and evacuate any area from where Hezbollah and its members or their assistants are launching their terrorist operations. Be aware!" To date, Hezbollah has fired 3,333 rockets into northern Israel, Israeli authorities report.<ref name=CNN-08-10>{{cite news|title=Israeli tanks stream into Lebanon|date=[[2006-08-10]]|publisher=[[CNN]]|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/08/10/mideast.main/index.html}}</ref>  Another flier from the IDF threatens civilians directly:  "each expansion of Hizbollah terrorist operations will lead to a harsh and powerful response and its painful response will not be confined to Hassan's gang of criminals."[http://news.independent.co.uk/world/fisk/article1218405.ece]
*Israeli troops have seized the southern Lebanese town of [[Marjeyoun]] and heavy clashes were reported in the area around the town after armoured columns crossed the Lebanese border overnight. Other Israeli troops also advanced on the town of [[Khiam]]. Israeli jets also struck a lighthouse used as a cell phone communications tower in central Beirut. <ref>{{cite news|title=Israel seizes south Lebanon town |date=[[2006-08-10]]|publisher=[[BBC News]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4778591.stm}}</ref>Witnesses said they saw a man being loaded into an ambulance at the scene. There was no immediate information on his condition. The area, located in an upscale neighborhood where slain former Lebanese Prime Minister [[Rafik Hariri]] lived, is outside the Hezbollah-dominated southern suburbs that Israeli forces have targeted up to now. Israeli troops had warned residents to remain in their homes as forces moved toward the nearby town of [[Blatt]], Lebanese military intelligence and police said. The secured area overlooks the [[Litani River]], where Hezbollah fighters have reportedly launched rockets into Israel, sources said.<ref name=CNN-08-10>{{cite news|title=Hezbollah attack kills 2 Israeli civilians; U.N. vote delayed|date=[[2006-08-10]]|publisher=[[CNN]]|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/08/10/mideast.main/index.html}}</ref>
* An Israeli unmanned drone fired a missile on a minibus driving in the [[Bekaa Valley]], thus killing one person and wounding 12. The attack happened near the town of [[Rayak]]. Another air strike targeted a road linking the city of [[Baalbek]] with the Syrian city of Homs <ref>{{cite news|title=Israeli jets strike Beirut and Bekaa|date=[[2006-08-10]]|publisher=[[Al Jazeera]]|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/28B3FC76-7711-4B99-9403-A0627E1FA7E8.htm}}</ref>.

|'''Israel'''
* An Israeli government spokeswoman said the Marjayoun-offensive was not part of an expanded campaign that Israel's Security Cabinet had approved earlier in the day. A sticking point in the U.S.-France plan to end the conflict remains a Lebanese call for Israel's immediate withdrawal from southern Lebanon. More than 950 people have died in the conflict so far, Israeli authorities said. Most have been Lebanese civilians. On a separate front, the [[Gaza]]-[[Egypt]] border crossing is closing until further notice, Israel said, citing specific security alerts.<ref name=CNN-08-10>{{cite news|title=Israeli tanks stream into Lebanon|date=[[2006-08-10]]|publisher=[[CNN]]|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/08/10/mideast.main/index.html}}</ref>

|'''Hezbollah'''
* Two Israeli civilians -- including a child -- were killed and two were wounded after Hezbollah militants launched a Katyusha rocket into the village of [[Deir al Assad]] in northern Israel, ambulance service officials said. Another rocket struck [[Kriot]] in the northern suburbs of [[Haifa]], Israel, authorities said. The strike on Haifa came a day after Hezbollah leader [[Hassan Nasrallah]] urged Israeli Arabs in the city, Israel's third-largest to leave, lest Muslim blood be shed. Hezbollah announced "violent battles" in Marjeyoun, and Arab news networks [[Al-Manar]] and [[Al Arabiya]] reported at least two Israeli tanks were destroyed in fighting there. By afternoon, Hezbollah had sent 136 rockets into northern Israel, police said. To date, Hezbollah has fired 3,333 rockets into northern Israel, Israeli authorities report.<ref name=CNN-08-10>{{cite news|title=Israeli tanks stream into Lebanon|date=[[2006-08-10]]|publisher=[[CNN]]|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/08/10/mideast.main/index.html}}</ref>

* Receiving warning leaflets from Israel were northern Lebanese towns including [[El Beddaoui]], Lebanese Internal Security Forces said. Those leaflets warned that Israel will target any type of truck moving along the coastal road. "Be aware that anybody using pick-ups or trucks puts his life in danger," one leaflet warned. The leaflets said such vehicles will be targeted under suspicion of "transporting rockets, military ammunitions and terrorists." North of Beirut, three Israeli rockets launched from the sea also hit three state radio towers, Lebanese police said. Those towers already have been targets of attacks during the conflict. Israeli troops had warned residents to remain in their homes as forces moved toward the nearby town of Blatt, Lebanese military intelligence and police said.<ref name=CNN-08-10>{{cite news|title=Israel strikes at heart of Beirut, drops warning leaflets|date=[[2006-08-10]]|publisher=[[CNN]]|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/08/10/mideast.main/index.html}}</ref>

|'''United Nations''' 
* The UN's top humanitarian official, [[Jan Egeland]], criticised both Israel and Hezbollah for hindering access to southern Lebanon, calling the situation a "disgrace".<ref>{{cite news|title=UN attacks Lebanon aid 'disgrace'|date=[[2006-08-10]]|publisher=[[BBC News]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4778591.stm}}</ref>
* U.N. Secretary-General [[Kofi Annan]] pushed the [[Security Council]] to come up with a plan by week's end, August 12 to August 13, for ending the conflict. In a statement issued early afternoon, Annan's office said he is working "very intensely" on reaching a resolution acceptable to both Israel and Lebanon, and he repeated his call to end the fighting and "save civilians on both sides from the nightmare they have endured for the past four weeks." "The secretary-general believes that it ought to be possible for the Security Council to adopt a resolution by the end of the week," his office said.<ref name=CNN-08-10>{{cite news|title=Israel strikes at heart of Beirut, drops warning leaflets|date=[[2006-08-10]]|publisher=[[CNN]]|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/08/10/mideast.main/index.html}}</ref> 
*Meanwhile, the United Nations warned of a major food crisis in Lebanon, saying that the displacement of nearly a million people has coincided with the country's main cereal harvest. Of the 915,000 people the U.N. estimates to be internally displaced in Lebanon, 45 percent are children, it said. Fighting has disrupted the delivery of food, fuel and medical supplies and devastated much of the country's infrastructure, and the U.N. said 100,000 people in southern Lebanon won't be receiving vital relief. The emergency coordinator for the [[World Food Programme|U.N. World Food Program]], [[Zlatan Milisic]], said no aid has been able to reach areas south of [[Sidon]]. A relief convoy planned for [[Nabatiya]] was denied IDF approval, said Milisic.<ref name=CNN-08-10>{{cite news|title=Israel strikes at heart of Beirut, drops warning leaflets|date=[[2006-08-10]]|publisher=[[CNN]]|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/08/10/mideast.main/index.html}}</ref> 
*The main points of a resolution to end fighting between Israel and Hezbollah have been agreed to by the U.S. and France, diplomatic sources said. U.N. observers described a vicious battle in Khiyam, which Israel said is a Hezbollah stronghold, during the Israeli advance to Marjayoun.<ref name=CNN-08-10>{{cite news|title=Israel strikes at heart of Beirut, drops warning leaflets|date=[[2006-08-10]]|publisher=[[CNN]]|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/08/10/mideast.main/index.html}}</ref>

|'''United States'''
* Diplomats meanwhile were trying to reconcile differences over a U.S.-France plan to end the conflict. A sticking point remains a Lebanese call for Israel's immediate withdrawal from southern Lebanon, a move Israel says it won't make without guarantees of its border security. Senior [[George W. Bush|Bush]] administration officials have said that a August 10 vote at the United Nations is unlikely. [[John R. Bolton|John Bolton]], the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said council members hope to vote on August 11 on the resolution, but "we're not there yet." <ref name=CNN-08-10>{{cite news|title=Israel strikes at heart of Beirut, drops warning leaflets|date=[[2006-08-10]]|publisher=[[CNN]]|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/08/10/mideast.main/index.html}}</ref>
*In Washington, senior State Department officials said the United States and France have reached a tentative deal on a resolution that would call for an end to the fighting; an Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon, in parallel with the deployment of Lebanese government and U.N. troops; and language on the status of the disputed territory of [[Shebaa Farms]], now under Israeli control. But an outstanding question is whether Lebanon's government will OK a resolution that gives a U.N. mission the mandate to use force, diplomatic sources said.<ref name=CNN-08-11>{{cite news|title=Israel strikes at heart of Beirut, drops warning leaflets|date=[[2006-08-11]]|publisher=[[CNN]]|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/08/11/mideast.main/index.html}}</ref>

* At least six people were killed and 41 others wounded when at least eight Israeli missiles hit a Lebanese Army convoy that had been joined by about 1,000 civilian vehicles, Lebanese security sources said. Red Cross workers told CNN that the convoy, which had consisted of 80 Lebanese security force vehicles and 100 civilian vehicles, had grown to 1,500 vehicles, as more civilians joined along the way. CNN's Michael Ware described the scene of the aftermath as "appalling carnage." Among the dead were a Lebanese army officer and three civilians. Of the 41 injured, 24 were Lebanese soldiers, security sources said. The convoy had left [[Marjeyoun]] after fighting there earlier in the day. It was full of civilians from southern Lebanon who had sought shelter at a Lebanese base in [[Marjeyoun]], Lebanese security sources said. It was in the [[Bekaa Valley]] town of [[Kefraya]] when it was hit, sources said. Many of those vehicles were on fire, and emergency personnel couldn't reach the wounded because of other Israeli airstrikes in the area, sources said. Israel Defense Forces confirmed the attack, carried out "on the suspicion that these were Hezbollah terrorists transporting weaponry" and that it was "along a route forbidden for travel." Whether the convoy, escorted by the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, was granted IDF permission to proceed is in dispute. The IDF said Saturday it did not grant permission for the convoy. But a spokesman for the [[United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon|UNIFIL]] in Lebanon, [[Milos Strugar]], said the Israeli army cleared the convoy for travel along a specific route to [[Zahle]].Two UNIFIL armored personnel carriers initially escorted the convoy but was no longer with it when the attack occurred. The convoy that was struck had broken off from the main body of vehicles after encountering traffic jams and bottlenecks.<ref name=CNN-08-12>{{cite news|title=Hezbollah leader agrees to cease-fire, with reservations|date=[[2006-08-12]]|publisher=[[CNN]]|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/08/12/mideast.main/index.html}}</ref>"Of the aid convoys that were authorized and coordinated by the IDF throughout this entire period, not a single convoy was hit by IDF fire," the Israeli military said.<ref name=CNN-08-13>{{cite news|title=Israel hits Lebanon ahead of cease-fire|date=[[2006-08-13]]|publisher=[[CNN]]|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/08/13/mideast.main/index.html}}</ref>

* Before the vote, U.N. Secretary-General [[Kofi Annan]] said he "wholeheartedly" welcomed the resolution, but he chastised the council for not acting sooner. "I would be remiss if I did not tell you how profoundly disappointed I am that the council did not reach this point much, much earlier," Annan said. "All members of this council must be aware that its inability to act sooner has badly shaken the world's faith in its authority and integrity."<ref name=CNN-08-12>{{cite news|title=Security Council passes proposal to end Mideast conflict|date=[[2006-08-12]]|publisher=[[CNN]]|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/08/12/mideast.main/index.html}}</ref>
* A UN-resolution to end the conflict has been unanimously accepted by the Security Council.

But he said "we are still in a war," and Hezbollah "will continue to defend" itself. "As long as our land is occupied, we will continue the resistance," he said.

|'''Lebanon'''
* The Lebanese government, which includes two members of Hezbollah, unanimously approved [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701|Security Council Resolution 1701]], Prime Minister [[Fouad Siniora]] said. Siniora said, according the U.N.- proposal only the Lebanese Army and U.N. forces would be allowed to bear arms . The announcement followed a meeting of the Lebanese Cabinet, and Siniora said the Cabinet would meet again August 13 to discuss the resolution's implementation, but then postponed the meeting for up to two days to August 15. A Lebanese government minister said the postponement came at the request of parliamentary speaker [[Nabih Berri]], a key negotiator with Hezbollah, to give government officials more time to discuss the plan with Hezbollah. Sources in Berri's office denied the report. The postponement sparked concern worldwide among leaders with high hopes for the resolution. A senior Lebanese government source said Prime Minister Fouad Siniora received calls from U.S. Secretary of State [[Condoleezza Rice]], Egyptian President [[Hosni Mubarak]], French President [[Jacques Chirac]], and U.N. Secretary-General [[Kofi Annan]]. The White House confirmed that Rice spoke with Siniora, but a White House spokesman did not know who initiated that call. The State Department had no immediate comment. The senior Lebanese government source said [[George W. Bush|Bush]] called Siniora as well, but the White House denied that. The source also said Annan told Siniora that if Hezbollah maintains its position against disarmament south of the Litani, an international force can't go into Lebanon.<ref name=CNN-08-12>{{cite news|title=Lebanon accepts cease-fire; Hezbollah says it will|date=[[2006-08-12]]|publisher=[[CNN]]|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/08/12/mideast.main/index.html}}</ref>
* Siniora had sharp words for Israel, telling reporters that the Jewish state's decision not to approve the cease-fire immediately gives the Israeli military "a blank check" to continue pounding Lebanon and "targeting civilians."

* The Israeli Cabinet approved a U.N. cease-fire resolution aimed at stopping the fighting between Israel and Hezbollah that has raged for more than a month. Israeli Foreign Minister [[Tzipi Livni]] said that U.N. resolution 1701 is "good for Israel" and "will change the rules of the game in Lebanon and the relationship between Israel and Lebanon as well." During the Cabinet meeting, Israeli Prime Minister [[Ehud Olmert]] said that with the resolution, "Hezbollah will no longer be a state within a state in Lebanon," according to the Israeli news Web site [[Ynetnews|Ynet]]. Israel has made clear it will not immediately pull out, but will wait until other forces arrive to prevent the Hezbollah militia from again taking over the area on Israel's northern border. "We ask that there not be a vacuum, in other words that there not be a situation in which the IDF exits and there remains a vacuum there and the Hezbollah returns to those places where it left, or alternately remains in those places and nothing actually happens," Livni told. Barak said, "It will not be fully quiet -- that's the major risk -- until the international force will come."<ref name=CNN-08-13>{{cite news|title=Israel, Hezbollah step up attacks as cease-fire deadline nears|date=[[2006-08-13]]|publisher=[[CNN]]|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/08/13/mideast.main/index.html}}</ref>

"What if some trucks will come from [[Syria]] with new launchers and rockets? If we attack them, some might say it's not defensive," said Barak.

The first of 15,000 Lebanese forces will begin moving into areas south of the [[Litani River]] by August 17, Lebanese officials said. "Everything is in preparation now, politically and practically on the ground," [[Nouhad Mahmoud]], Lebanese U.N.

* Thousands of Lebanese civilians displaced by the 34-day conflict clogged southbound roads, trying to return home despite warnings from the Israeli military that it was not yet safe. Because most of the bridges over the Litani River were destroyed in more than four weeks of airstrikes, some people waded through the water, including mothers carrying their babies. Lebanese officials have said 850,000 people were displaced by the conflict.<ref name=CNN-08-15>{{cite news|title=Lebanon truce holds despite clashes|date=[[2006-08-15]]|publisher=[[CNN]]|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/08/15/mideast.main/index.html}}</ref>

Lebanese Internal Security Forces reported a total of 989 fatalities since the conflict began July 12, including 56 bodies retrieved from the village of [[Srifa]]. In a sign of lingering danger in south Lebanon, security officials said an explosive detonated in the town of [[Nabatiye]], killing a 20-year-old man, The [[Associated Press]] reported.

* The Lebanese government considered how to make the U.N.-brokered cease-fire work. Senior political sources told the Lebanese Cabinet would convene to discuss cease-fire implementation, and is expected to look at several options, including integrating [[Hezbollah]] fighters into the Lebanese army. That option has been rejected by Hezbollah, the sources said.<ref name=CNN-08-16>{{cite news|title=Israel says its troops could stay in Lebanon for months|date=[[2006-08-16]]|publisher=[[CNN]]|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/08/16/mideast.main/index.html}}</ref>
* The Lebanese Cabinet unanimously approved the deployment of 15,000 troops to southern Lebanon beginning August 17, a minister told, moving to take control of a region Hezbollah militants have effectively controlled since [[2000]].

* A video showing Lebanese soldiers cordially offering Israeli troops glasses of tea during the military offensive earlier this month has hit Israeli and Hezbollah airwaves. The video, shot by Israelis on August 10, when Israeli troops "took control" of the southern Lebanese town of Marjeyoun, aired on Israel's Channel 2. Hezbollah's [[Al-Manar|al-Manar]] TV network and pro-Hezbollah NEW TV then picked up the video and condemned the Lebanese soldiers as deserters. In the video, two Israeli tanks roll up to the gate of the Marjeyoun garrison, where a white surrender flag flutters outside the barracks. Inside, Lebanese soldiers hold trays with glasses of tea, which they offer to the Israelis. The encounter appears merely social. However, it is possible that unpleasant parts of the video were deleted during editing. After the video aired, the Lebanese interior ministry ordered the arrest of the base commander, Gen. [[Adnan Daoud]], according to The [[Associated press]]. Lebanon does not recognize Israel and forbids its citizens any contact with Israelis. At one point in the video, Daoud and an Israeli soldier have the following exchange: Daoud: "Don't we need to tell our bosses?" Israeli soldier: "Tell whoever you want." Daoud: "We need to brief them on what happened." Israeli soldier: "We briefed (U.S. President) [[George W. Bush|Bush]]. You brief whoever you want." Daoud: "We need to brief Bush too." Tape reflects the Lebanese army's hands-off policy in the fighting between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah. Lebanon didn't want to turn the conflict into a war between it and Israel. The actions, as depicted in a video where parts may have been deleted and edited, could suggest the Lebanese army is weak and unable to take southern Lebanon back from Hezbollah without help. There are conflicting reports of what happened at Marjeyoun, a largely Christian town. Lebanese intelligence said the Israeli troops met no resistance when they entered the town. Arab-language network [[Al-Jazeera]] has quoted Hezbollah as saying "violent battles" took place with their militants, and Arab news networks Al-Manar and [[Al-Arabiya]] reported at least two Israeli tanks were destroyed in the fighting. Lebanese acting Interior Minister [[Ahmed Fatfat]] defended the Lebanese forces at the barracks, which he said included 350 Lebanese internal security officers and soldiers from the army's intelligence unit. "This force is not on a combat mission. This force has simple individual weapons to act as a police force. They don't have tanks or missile launchers. This is a force that was assigned to support the residents and protect them, provide them with humanitarian assistance," he said. Other critics view the Lebanese army's general as having committed an act of treason. <ref name=CNN-08-17>{{cite news|title=Video provokes questions of Lebanese army|date=[[2006-08-17]]|publisher=[[CNN]]|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/08/17/mideast.main/index.html}}</ref>

* The United Nations is warning member nations that it should provide troops to the peacekeeping force if the cease-fire is to hold. After a meeting with representatives from 49 countries that could potentially contribute troops, three predominantly Muslim countries -- [[Bangladesh]], [[Indonesia]] and [[Malaysia]] -- offered a few battalions of infantrymen. But European nations have been reluctant to commit their own troops. [[France]] has offered 200 extra troops, while [[Germany]] offered only a naval and aerial force to secure Lebanon's borders.<ref name=CNN-08-19>{{cite news|title=Israel targets transfer of weapons|date=[[2006-08-19]]|publisher=[[CNN]]|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/08/19/mideast.main/index.html}}</ref>In Rome, [[Italy]]'s government formally approved a plan to send up to 3,000 troops to Lebanon, the prime minister's office said.<ref name=CNN-08-18>{{cite news|title=National flag raised in southern Lebanon|date=[[2006-08-18]]|publisher=[[CNN]]|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/08/18/mideast.main/index.html}}</ref>The troops have been ready to deploy for some time but the Italian government is waiting until they receive guidance from the United Nations, Italian defense officials said.<ref name=CNN-08-22>{{cite news|title=Israeli troops shoot Hezbollah militants|date=[[2006-08-22]]|publisher=[[CNN]]|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/08/22/mideast.main/index.html}}</ref>
* Since the cease-fire took effect, about 400,000 displaced Lebanese civilians have returned to the southern suburbs of [[Beirut]] and areas in the south, U.N. Secretary-General [[Kofi Annan]] said in a report to the Security Council. He has appealed for member states to provide peacekeeping troops for Lebanon, assuring them the U.N. force will not "wage war" on Israel, Lebanon, or Hezbollah militants. In the report Annan said he is "encouraged by the positive first steps." But he stressed that much more needs to be done. "I would caution that the situation is still very fragile," he said. Annan added that humanitarian aid needs to accelerate in south Lebanon as more people return home so that their food, shelter and medical needs can be met.<ref name=CNN-08-18>{{cite news|title=National flag raised in southern Lebanon|date=[[2006-08-18]]|publisher=[[CNN]]|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/08/18/mideast.main/index.html}}</ref>

* Israeli forces tried to penetrate the Hezbollah town Boudai about 3 a.m., swooping in on helicopters deep into the Bekaa Valley 60 miles from the Israeli border. The Israeli military later said the commandos were trying to interdict [[Iran]]ian weapons being smuggled to guerrillas from [[Syria]]. The Israelis lost one soldier and one later died of his wounds.

* "The cease-fire is based on (U.N. resolution) 1701 which calls for an international arms embargo against Hezbollah," Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman [[Mark Regev]] said. "In the absence of that presence, arms transfers to Hezbollah are a clear violation of 1701 and Israel is entitled to respond. When the international forces and the Lebanese Army are enforcing the embargo, Israeli action becomes superfluous." <ref name=BBC-08-20>{{cite news|title=Israeli commando raid alarms UN|date=[[2006-08-20]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/5267736.stm}}</ref> Israel won't accept "a cease-fire in which Hezbollah can use that cease-fire just as a timeout to regroup and rearm and prepare for the next round," said Regev.

Meanwhile, [[Hassan Hobballaha]], a Hezbollah member of the Lebanese Parliament, called the [[Bouday]]- move "proof that the Israeli enemy is still carrying on with its aggression...and that it doesn't care about the resolutions taken by the U.N. Security Council. "As we have stressed before, it is attacking Lebanon and has greediness in this country," he said. "Therefore we do not consider what happened as new for the enemy, but the resistance is still insisting that it will fight against any Israeli attempt."<ref name=CNN-08-19>{{cite news|title=Lebanon warns over Israeli raid|date=[[2006-08-19]]|publisher=[[CNN]]|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/08/19/mideast.main/index.html}}

* Annan spoke with both Israeli Prime Minister [[Ehud Olmert]] and Lebanon's [[Fouad Siniora]], the spokesman said. Annan instructed both governments to provide to the Security Council "daily reports of compliance," the statement said. During his discussion with Olmert, Annan said he had received complaints about Israel Defense Forces activity in Lebanon, specifically the Bekaa Valley raid on Saturday, according to Israeli government officials. The two also discussed progress in the formation of the agreed-upon international U.N. peacekeeping force in southern Lebanon, Israeli government officials said. Their discussion coincided with the arrival by boat of 50 French troops at the southern Lebanese city of Naqoura, the first contingent of international reinforcements since the cease-fire went into effect August 14. Meanwhile, a U.N. delegation met with Siniora and other Lebanese officials, including Murr and parliament Speaker [[Nabih Berri]], to discuss the means of implementing Security Council Resolution 1701.<ref name=CNN-08-19>{{cite news|title=U.N.: Israeli raid violates cease-fire|date=[[2006-08-19]]|publisher=[[CNN]]|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/08/19/mideast.main/index.html}}
