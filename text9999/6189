'''Leigh Woods''' is a {{convert|2|km<U+00B2>}} area of woodland on the south-west side of the [[Avon Gorge]], close to the [[Clifton Suspension Bridge]], opposite the English city of [[Bristol]] and north of the [[Ashton Court]] estate, of which it formed a part.

[[Stokeleigh Camp]], a [[hillfort]] thought to have been occupied from 3BC to 1AD and also in the [[Middle Ages]], lies on the edge of the Nightingale Valley. [[Limestone]] and [[Celestine (mineral)|celestine]] which were worked in the 18th and 19th centuries are now derelict. In 1909 part of the woodland was donated to the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] by [[George Alfred Wills]], to prevent development of the city beside the gorge following the bulding of the [[Leigh Woods, Somerset|Leigh Woods]] suburb. Areas not owned by the National Trust have since been taken over by the [[Forestry Commission]].

It is as a [[national nature reserve (United Kingdom)|national nature reserve]] and is included in the Avon Gorge [[Site of Special Scientific Interest]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sssi.naturalengland.org.uk/citation/citation_photo/1003073.pdf |title=Avon Gorge SSSI |accessdate=7 January 2012 |format=PDF |work=Natural England }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/avons-national-nature-reserves/avons-national-nature-reserves#leigh-woods|title=Leigh Woods NNR|publisher=Natural England|accessdate=16 May 2015}}</ref> Rare trees include multiple species of Sorbus with at least nine native and four imported species. [[Bristol rockcress]] (''Arabis scabra'') which is unique to the Avon Gorge can be seen flowering in April; various species of [[Orchidaceae|orchids]] and [[western spiked speedwell]] (''Veronica spicata'') are common in June and July.

== Topography ==
The woods, which cover an area of {{convert|2|km<U+00B2>}}, are on a ridge which mainly consists of [[limestone]], with some [[sandstone]] which runs from [[Clifton, Bristol|Clifton]] to [[Clevedon]], {{convert|10|mi}} away on the [[Bristol Channel]] coast. At the southern end of the wood is Nightingale Valley (one of several thus named in the area), a [[dry valley]] which is cut into the side of the gorge.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bristol's Great Glacier? Stage 4|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/bristol/content/nature/04.shtml|website=Nature|publisher=BBC}}</ref> It area slopes from the highest point nearly opposite the north gate of [[Ashton Court]] to the [[River Avon, Bristol|River Avon]] beside the western buttress of the [[Clifton Suspension Bridge]]. The woods are on the [[Monarch's Way]] long distance footpath.<ref>{{cite news|title=Enjoy autumnal colours|url=http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/Enjoy-autumnal-colours/story-11256016-detail/story.html|accessdate=18 May 2015|work=Bristol Post|date=8 November 2008}}</ref>

To the south of the woods is an expensive suburb of Bristol also known as [[Leigh Woods, Somerset|Leigh Woods]]. It is situated at the western end of the [[Clifton Suspension Bridge]], which opened in 1864, making the development of Leigh Woods as an upmarket residential area practicable.<ref>{{cite web|title=A History of Long Ashton & Leigh Woods|url=http://lalife.org.uk/key-information/long-ashton-history/|publisher=Long Ashton Community Website|accessdate=21 April 2014}}</ref> Houses in varying styles were built from the mid-1860s until the [[World War I|First World War]].<ref>{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.leighwoods.org/History/history.html|publisher=Leigh Woods|accessdate=18 May 2015}}</ref> Styles adopted included [[Italianate architecture|Italian]], neo-[[Jacobean architecture|Jacobean]], [[Scottish baronial architecture|Scottish baronial]], Swiss chalet, domestic revival and [[Arts and Crafts movement|arts and crafts]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Leigh Woods Village Design Statement|url=http://www.leighwoods.org/Introduction/LW_Village_Design_2000.pdf|publisher=Leigh Woods Village|accessdate=21 April 2014|format=PDF}}</ref> At the western end of the bridge is Burwalls House, a [[Victorian era|Victorian]] mansion owned by the [[University of Bristol]] and used as a centre for continuing education.<ref>{{cite web|title=Burwalls|url=http://www.burwallsbristol.co.uk/history.html|publisher=Burwalls|accessdate=18 May 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Burwalls House|url=http://www.leighwoods.org/History/Burwalls_House/burwalls_house.html|publisher=Leigh Woods|accessdate=18 May 2015}}</ref> On a bluff overlooking the bridge is Alpenfels, a mock Swiss chalet constructed for the Wills tobacco family.<ref>{{cite web|title=A Snapshot of 1901|url=http://www.leighwoods.org/History/Leigh_Woods_People/Leigh_Woods_Snaps/leigh_woods_snaps.html|publisher=Leigh Woods|accessdate=18 May 2015}}</ref>

Part of the woodland was donated to the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] in 1909 by [[George Alfred Wills]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Leigh Woods: History|url=http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/leigh-woods/history/|publisher=National Trust|accessdate=16 May 2015}}</ref> to prevent development of the city beside the gorge.<ref>{{cite news|title=Mr George Wills Guft of Leigh Woods|url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000264/19090331/208/0007|accessdate=18 May 2015|work=Western Daily Press|date=31 March 1909| via = [[British Newspaper Archive]]|subscription=yes|page=7}}</ref> Areas not owned by the National Trust have since been taken over by the [[Forestry Commission]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Leigh Woods|url=http://www.forestofavon.org.uk/leighwoods.html|publisher=Forest of Avon|accessdate=18 May 2015}}</ref>

The [[Portishead Railway]] runs along the bottom of the woods. It was closed by the [[Beeching cuts]] in the 1960s, but has now been reopened for freight traffic as far as [[Royal Portbury Dock]], {{convert|2.5|mi}} downstream.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of the Line|url=http://www.portisheadweb.org.uk/prg/history.html|publisher=Portishead Railway Group|accessdate=18 May 2015}}</ref>{{sfn|Awdry|1990}}{{sfn|Carter|1959}} Between 1928 and 1932, the area had its own railway station, [[Nightingale Valley Halt railway station|Nightingale Valley Halt]].

In 1957 a [[RAF Filton|Filton]]-based RAF [[de Havilland Vampire|Vampire]] jet from [[No. 501 Squadron RAF|501 Squadron]] piloted by [[Flying officer]] John Greenwood flew under the deck of the suspension bridge while performing a [[Aileron roll|victory roll]]{{sfn|Griffiths|2012|p=61}} before crashing in Leigh Woods, killing the pilot.{{sfn|Whittell|2007|p=151}}

Small [[mountain biking]] circuits are present in the woods and the area is a popular walking area for Bristolians.<ref>{{cite web|title=Leigh Woods Activities|url=http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/leigh-woods/things-to-see-and-do/activities/|publisher=National Trust|accessdate=18 May 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Yer Tiz (Leigh Woods)|url=http://bristoltrailsgroup.com/local-trails/yer-tiz-leigh-woods/|publisher=Bristol Trails Group|accessdate=18 May 2015}}</ref>

The south part of the woods is an area of former pasture woodland with old pollards, mainly oak and some small-leaved lime. To the north, the area comprises ancient woodland of old coppice with standards and contains a rich variety of trees. Rare trees include [[Sorbus bristoliensis|Bristol whitebeam]] (''Sorbus bristoliensis'') and [[Sorbus torminalis|wild service tree]] (''Sorbus torminalis''). There are multiple species of Sorbus within the woods with at least nine native and four imported species, making it one of the most important sites in Britain for this tree.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rich|first1=T.C.G.|last2=Houston|first2=L.|title=Sorbus whiteana (Rosaceae), a new endemic tree from Britain|journal=Watsonia|date=2006|volume=26|url=http://www.archive.bsbi.org.uk/Wats26p1.pdf|pages=1<U+2013>7}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rich|first1=T.G.G.|last2=Houston|first2=L.|title=The distribution and population sizes of the rare English endemic Sorbus wilmottiana E.
