'''Gaines Adams''' (June 8, 1983 <U+2013> January 17, 2010) was an [[American football]] [[defensive end]] in the [[National Football League]]. He was drafted by the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] in the first round in the [[2007 NFL Draft]] and in 2009 was traded to the [[Chicago Bears]].  He played [[college football]] at [[Clemson Tigers football|Clemson]].

==Early years==
Adams attended [[Fork Union Military Academy]] in 2001 and recorded 58 tackles, 22 sacks, and two interceptions in 10 games. He was a three year starter at Cambridge Academy, a small private school which only had an 8-man football team, where he was a dominant wide receiver and defensive end. His coach during high school was former University of South Carolina quarterback, [[Steve Taneyhill]]. In 2000, his team won the state title. During that year, Cambridge shut out four different teams, beating one team 80<U+2013>0. They had suffered only one loss that season to arch-rival King Academy. He had 158 career receptions for 4,394 yard and 65 touchdowns, as well as 341 tackles, 10 interceptions, and 33 sacks in his career, and was a two-time All-state honoree. He chose Clemson over Georgia, Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia. He had narrowed down his choices to North Carolina and Clemson, then signed with Clemson after the Tar Heels unexpectedly rescinded their offer. At Cambridge, he was named to the Greenwood Touchdown Club/Index-Journal All-Lakelands Team (which included four counties).

==College career==
Adams was [[redshirt (college sports)|redshirted]] in 2002.

In 2003, as a redshirt freshman, he did not see much action as the second-team defensive end, only totaling 15 tackles and a sack.

In 2004, he had 35 tackles with 8 sacks, and two blocked punts playing on special teams. For his hard work on special teams, Adams was awarded the 12th Man Award for Clemson's defense. Adams considered coming out for the [[NFL Draft]] after his sophomore year, but after the underclassman panel gave him a conservatively low ranking he decided to stay for his junior year.

Adams' 2005 junior year was the year he broke out. Adams totaled 56 tackles, 9.5 sacks, and forced three fumbles while starting at boundary defensive end.

For Adams' senior year, 2006, he was slated to be among the best defensive ends in the college football. Adams lived up to his reputation by starting all 12 games, recording 12.5 sacks,causing 2 fumbles and recovering 3. By the end of the 2006 season, Adams recorded a total of 28 career [[Quarterback sack|sacks]], tying the school record set by [[Michael Dean Perry]] (1984<U+2013>1987)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sportsline.com/nfl/players/draft/405275 |title=Gaines Adams player profile at CBS Sportsline |accessdate=2007-04-30}},</ref>. In addition, Adams was named to all five official [[2006 College Football All-America Team|All-America]] teams acknowledged by the NCAA in 2006, one of seven unanimous All-Americans that year.
