The '''construction of the [[World Trade Center]]''' was conceived as an [[urban renewal]] project, spearheaded by [[David Rockefeller]], to help revitalize [[Lower Manhattan]]. The project was developed by the [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey]], which hired architect [[Minoru Yamasaki]] who came up with the specific idea for twin towers.  After extensive negotiations, the [[New Jersey]] and [[New York|New York State]] governments, which oversee the Port Authority, agreed to support the World Trade Center project at the [[Radio Row, Manhattan|Radio Row]] site on the lower-west side of [[Manhattan]]. To make the agreement acceptable to New Jersey, the Port Authority agreed to take over the bankrupt Hudson & Manhattan Railroad (renamed as [[Port Authority Trans-Hudson|PATH]]), which brought commuters from New Jersey to the Lower Manhattan site. 

The towers were designed as framed tube structures, which provided tenants with open floor plans, uninterrupted by columns or walls.  This was accomplished using numerous closely-spaced perimeter columns to provide much of the strength to the structure, along with gravity load shared with the core columns.  The [[elevator]] system, which made use of [[sky lobby|sky lobbies]] and a system of express and local elevators, allowed substantial floor space to be freed up for use as office space by making the structural core smaller.  The design and construction of the World Trade Center twin towers involved many other innovative techniques, such as the [[slurry wall]] for digging the [[Foundation (architecture)|foundation]], and [[wind tunnel]] experiments.  Construction of the World Trade Center's North Tower began in August 1968, and the South Tower in 1969.  Extensive use of prefabricated components helped to speed up the construction process.  The first tenants moved into the North Tower in December 1970 and into the South Tower in January 1972.  Four other low-level buildings were constructed as part of the World Trade Center in the 1970s, and a [[7 World Trade Center|seventh]] building was constructed in the mid-1980s.

==Planning==
In 1942, [[Austin J. Tobin]] became the Executive Director of the [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey|Port Authority]], beginning a 30-year career during which he oversaw the planning and development of the World Trade Center.<ref name="Doig-chap1">{{cite book |last=Doig |first=Jameson W. |title=Empire on the Hudson |year=2001 |publisher=Columbia University Press |chapter=Chapter 1}}</ref>  The concept of establishing a "[[Worldwide world trade center|world trade center]]" was conceived during the post-[[World War II]] period, when the [[United States]] thrived economically and international trade was increasing.  In 1946, the [[New York State Legislature]] passed a bill that called for a "world trade center" to be established.<ref name="nyt-07061946">{{cite news |title=Dewey Picks Board for Trade Center |publisher=The New York Times |date=July 6, 1946}}</ref>  The World Trade Corporation was founded, and a board was appointed by New York Governor [[Thomas E.

===Original plans===
[[Image:East-side-wtc.png|thumb|right|300px|Architect's model for the proposed World Trade Center on the East River]]
During the post-war period, economic growth was concentrated in [[Midtown Manhattan]], in part stimulated by the [[Rockefeller Center]], which was developed in the 1930s.  Meanwhile, Lower Manhattan was left out of the [[Boom and bust|economic boom]].  One exception was the construction of [[One Chase Manhattan Plaza]] in the [[Financial District, Manhattan|Financial District]], by [[David Rockefeller]], who led [[urban renewal]] efforts in Lower Manhattan.<ref name="Gillespie-chap1">{{cite book |author=Gillespie, Angus K. |year=1999  |title=Twin Towers: The Life of New York City's World Trade Center |chapter=Chapter 1 |publisher=Rutgers University Press}}</ref>  In 1958, Rockefeller established the Downtown-Lower Manhattan Association (DLMA), which commissioned [[Skidmore, Owings and Merrill]] to draw up plans for revitalizing [[Lower Manhattan]].  The plans, made public in 1960, called for a World Trade Center to be built on a 13-acre (5.25&nbsp;ha) site along the [[East River]], from [[Old Slip]] to [[Fulton Street (Manhattan)|Fulton Street]] and between [[Water Street (Manhattan)|Water Street]] and [[South Street (Manhattan)|South Street]].<ref name="Levinson">{{cite book|last=Levinson |first=Leonard Louis| title=Wall Street| year=1961| publisher=Ziff Davis Publishing| location=New York| page=346}}</ref><ref name="nyt-01271960">{{cite news |title=A World Center of Trade Mapped Off Wall Street |date=January 27, 1960 |publisher=The New York Times |author=Grutzner, Charles}}</ref>  The complex would include a 900-foot (275&nbsp;m) long [[Convention center|exhibition hall]], and a 50<U+2013>70 story building, with some of its upper floors used as a hotel.<ref>{{cite book |title=Men of Steel: The Story of the Family That Built the World Trade Center |author=Koch, Karl III |publisher=Three Rivers Press |year=2002 |pages=p. 173}}</ref>  Other amenities would include a theater, shops, and restaurants.<ref name="dlma-plan">{{cite news |title=Text of Trade Center Report by the Downtown-Lower Manhattan Association |publisher= The New York Times |date=January 27, 1960}}</ref>  The plan also called for a new [[security (finance)|securities]] exchange building, which the Downtown-Lower Manhattan Association hoped would house the [[New York Stock Exchange]].<ref name="nyt-01271960"/>

David Rockefeller suggested that the Port Authority would be a logical choice for taking on the project.<ref name="nyt-01271960"/>  Rockefeller argued that the Trade Center would provide great benefits in facilitating and increasing volume of international commerce coming through the Port of New York.<ref name="dlma-plan"/>  Given the importance of [[New York City]] in global commerce, Port Authority director Austin J. Tobin remarked that the proposed project should be ''the'' World Trade Center, and not just ''a'' "world trade center".<ref>{{cite news |title=Tobin Says Proposed Center Should Be World's Best |publisher=The New York Times |date=May 5, 1960}}</ref>  After a year-long review of the proposal, the Port Authority formally backed the project on [[March 11]] [[1961]].<ref>{{cite news |title=355 Million World Trade Center Backed by Port Authority Study |publisher=The New York Times |date=March 12, 1961}}</ref>

===Agreement===
[[Image:Wtc locator map.png|thumb|right|300px|Location of World Trade Center and originally proposed site]]
The States of New York and New Jersey also needed to approve the project, given their control and oversight role of the Port Authority. Objections to the plan came from [[New Jersey]] Governor [[Robert B. Meyner]], who resented that [[New York]] would be getting this $335 million project.<ref name="Gillespie-chap1"/> Meanwhile, ridership on New Jersey's [[Hudson and Manhattan Railroad]] (H&M) had declined substantially from a high of 113&nbsp;million riders in 1927 to 26&nbsp;million in 1958, after new automobile tunnels and bridges opened across the [[Hudson River]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Rails Under the Mighty Hudson |author=Cudahy, Brian J. |publisher=Fordham University Press |year=2002 |pages=p. 56}}</ref> Toward the end of 1961, negotiations with outgoing New Jersey Governor Meyner regarding the World Trade Center project reached a stalemate. In December 1961, Tobin met with newly elected New Jersey Governor [[Richard J. Hughes]], and made a proposal to shift the World Trade Center project to a west side site where the [[Hudson Terminal]] was located.<ref name="nyt-1961dec29">{{cite news |title=Port Unit Backs Linking of H&M and Other Lines |author=Grutzner, Charles |publisher=The New York Times |date=December 29, 1961}}</ref> In acquiring the Hudson & Manhattan Railroad, the Port Authority would also acquire the Hudson Terminal and other buildings which were deemed obsolete.<ref name="nyt-1961dec29"/> On [[January 22]] [[1962]], the two states reached an agreement to allow the Port Authority to take over the railroad and to build the World Trade Center on Manhattan's lower west side.<ref>{{cite news |title=2 States Agree on Hudson Tubes and Trade Center |author=Wright, George Cable |date=January 23, 1962 |publisher=The New York Times}}</ref>  The shift in location for the World Trade Center to a site more convenient to New Jersey, together with Port Authority acquisition of the H&M Railroad, brought New Jersey to agreement in support of the World Trade Center project.

===Controversy===
Even once the agreement between the states of New Jersey, New York, and the Port Authority was finalized, the World Trade Center plan faced continued controversy.  The site for the World Trade Center was the location of [[Radio Row]], which was home to hundreds of commercial and industrial tenants, property owners, small businesses, and approximately 100 residents.<ref name="Gillespie-chap1"/>  The World Trade Center plans involved evicting these business owners, some of whom fiercely protested the forced relocation.<ref name="Gillespie-chap1"/>  In June 1962, a group representing approximately 325 shops and 1,000 other affected small businesses filed an [[injunction]], challenging the Port Authority's power of [[eminent domain]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Injunction Asked on Trade Center |date=June 27, 1962 |publisher=The New York Times |author=Clark, Alfred E.}}</ref>  The dispute with local business owners worked its way through the court system, up to the [[New York Court of Appeals|New York State Court of Appeals]], which in April 1963 upheld the Port Authority's right of eminent domain, saying that the project had a "public purpose."<ref>{{cite news |title=World Trade Center Here Upheld by Appeals Court |author=Crowell, Paul |publisher=The New York Times |date=April 5, 1963}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Merchants Ask Supreme Court to Bar Big Trade Center Here |publisher=The New York Times / Associated Press |date=August 26, 1963}}</ref> On [[November 12]] [[1963]], the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] refused to accept the case.<ref name="nyt-1963nov13">{{cite news |title=High Court Plea is Lost by Foes of Trade Center |author=Arnold, Martin |publisher=The New York Times |date=November 13, 1963}}</ref><ref>[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&court=US&vol=375&page=78 375 US. 4] - ''Courtesy Sandwich Shop, Inc., et al. v.

Private [[real estate]] developers and members of the Real Estate Board of New York also expressed concerns about this much "subsidized" office space going on the open market, competing with the private sector when there was already a glut of vacancies.<ref name="Gillespie-chap1"/><ref>{{cite news |title=New Fight Begun on Trade Center |author=Knowles, Clayton |date=February 14, 1964 |publisher=The New York Times}}</ref> An especially vocal critic was Lawrence A.

In January 1964, the Port Authority inked a deal with the State of New York to locate government offices at the World Trade Center.<ref>{{cite news |title=State Will Rent at Trade Center |author=Sibley, John |publisher=The New York Times |date=January 14, 1964}}</ref> The Port Authority began signing commercial tenants in the spring and summer of 1964, including several banks.<ref>{{cite news |title=4th Bank Signed by Trade Center |date=July 14, 1964 |publisher=The New York Times}}</ref> In 1965, the Port Authority signed the [[United States Customs Service]] as a tenant.<ref>{{cite news |title=Customs to Move to Trade Center |author=Fowler, Glenn |date=July 7, 1965 |publisher=The New York Times}}</ref>

A final obstacle for the Port Authority was getting approval from New York City Mayor [[John Lindsay]] and the [[New York City Council]], who raised concerns about the limited extent that the Port Authority involved the city in the negotiations and deliberations. Negotiations between The City of New York and the Port Authority were centered on tax issues. A final agreement was made on [[August 3]], [[1966]], that the Port Authority would make annual payments to the City, in lieu of taxes, for the portion of the World Trade Center leased to private tenants.<ref>{{cite news |title=City Ends Fight with Port Body on Trade Center |author=Smith, Terence |date=August 4, 1966 |publisher=The New York Times}}</ref> In subsequent years, the payments would rise as the [[Property tax|real estate tax]] rate increased.<ref>{{cite news |title=Mayor Signs Pact on Trade Center |author=Smith, Terence |publisher=The New York Times |date=January 26, 1967}}</ref>

==Design==
On [[September 20]] [[1962]], the Port Authority announced the selection of [[Minoru Yamasaki]] as lead architect, and [[Emery Roth|Emery Roth & Sons]] as associate architects.<ref>{{cite news |title=Architect Named for Trade Center |author=Esterow, Milton |date=September 21, 1962 |publisher=The New York Times}}</ref> Originally, Yamasaki submitted to the Port Authority a concept incorporating twin towers, but with each building only 80 stories tall.

[[Image:World Trade Center Building Design with Floor and Elevator Arrangment.svg|thumb|250px|A typical floor layout and elevator arrangement of the WTC towers]]
To meet the Port Authority's requirement to build 10&nbsp;million [[Square foot|square feet]] (930,000&nbsp;m<U+00B2>) of office space, the buildings would each need to be 110 stories tall. A major limiting factor in building heights is elevators; the taller the building, the more [[elevator]]s are needed to service the building, requiring more space-consuming elevator banks.<ref>{{cite news |title=Biggest Buildings Herald New Era |author=Huxtable, Ada Louise |date=January 26, 1964 |publisher=The New York Times}}</ref> Yamasaki and the engineers decided to use a new system with sky lobbies, which are floors where people can switch from a large-capacity express elevator, which goes only to the sky lobbies, to a local elevator that goes to each floor in a section (the local elevators can be stacked within the same elevator shaft). Located on the 44th and 78th floors of each tower, the sky lobbies enabled the elevators to be used efficiently, while also increasing the amount of usable space on each floor from 62 to 75 percent by reducing the number of required elevator shafts.<ref>{{cite book |title=Design, Construction, and Maintenance of Structural and Life Safety Systems (NCSTAR 1-1) |publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology |pages=p. 9 |author=Lew, H.S., Richard W.

The structural engineering firm Skilling, Helle, Christiansen, [[Leslie Robertson|Robertson]] worked to implement Yamasaki's design, developing the tube-frame structural system used in the buildings. The Port Authority's Engineering Department served as [[geotechnical engineering|foundation engineers]], Joseph R. Loring & Associates as [[electrical engineering|electrical engineers]], and Jaros, Baum & Bolles as [[mechanical engineering|mechanical engineers]]. [[Tishman Reality & Construction|Tishman Realty & Construction Company]] was the [[general contractor]] on the World Trade Center project. Guy F. Tozzoli, director of the World Trade Department at the Port Authority, and the Port Authority's Chief Engineer, Rino M. Monti, oversaw the project.<ref>{{cite book |author=National Construction Safety Team |url=http://wtc.nist.gov/NISTNCSTAR1CollapseofTowers.pdf |format =PDF | title=Final Report on the Collapse of the World Trade Center Towers |publisher=NIST |chapter=Chapter 1 |date=September 2005 |pages=p. 1}}</ref>

===Structural design===
As an interstate agency, the Port Authority was not subject to local laws and regulations of the City of New York, including [[building code]]s. Nonetheless, the Port Authority required architects and structural engineers to follow the New York City building codes. At the time when the World Trade Center was planned, new building codes were being devised to replace the 1938 version that was still in place. The structural engineers ended up following draft versions of the new 1968 building codes, which incorporated "advanced techniques" in [[building design]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Design, Construction, and Maintenance of Structural and Life Safety Systems (NCSTAR 1-1) |publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology |pages=p. xxxviii |author=Lew, H.S., Richard W.

The World Trade Center towers included many [[structural engineering]] innovations in [[skyscraper design and construction]], which allowed the buildings to reach new heights and become the [[List of tallest buildings in the world|tallest]] in the world. Traditionally, [[skyscraper]]s used a skeleton of [[column]]s distributed throughout the interior to support building loads, with interior columns disrupting the floor space. The tube-frame concept was a major innovation, allowing open floor plans and more space to rent. The buildings used high-strength, load-bearing perimeter [[steel]] columns called [[Truss#Vierendeel truss|Vierendeel trusses]] that were spaced closely together to form a strong, rigid wall structure. There were 59 perimeter columns, narrowly spaced on each side of the buildings. These were designed to provide support for virtually all lateral loads (such as wind loads) and to share the gravity loads with the core columns.<ref>{{cite book |author=National Construction Safety Team |url=http://wtc.nist.gov/NISTNCSTAR1CollapseofTowers.pdf |title=Final Report on the Collapse of the World Trade Center Towers |publisher=NIST |format =PDF |date=September 2005 |chapter=Chapter 1 |pages=p. 6}}</ref> Structural analysis of major portions of the World Trade Center were computed on an [[IBM 1620]].<ref>{{cite journal | last = Taylor | first = R.

[[Image:Nistncstar1-1-fig2-4.png|thumb|right|Typical WTC architectural floor plan]]

The perimeter structure was constructed with extensive use of prefabricated modular pieces, which consisted of three columns, three stories tall, connected by [[wikt:spandrel|spandrel]] plates. The perimeter columns had a square cross section, 14&nbsp;inches (36&nbsp;cm) on a side, and were constructed of welded steel plate.<ref name="NIST-chapter1">{{cite book |author=National Construction Safety Team |url=http://wtc.nist.gov/NISTNCSTAR1CollapseofTowers.pdf |format =PDF |title=Final Report on the Collapse of the World Trade Center Towers |publisher=NIST |date=September 2005}}</ref> The thickness of the plates and grade of [[structural steel]] varied over the height of the tower, ranging from 36,000 to 100,000&nbsp;pounds per square inch<ref>[[A36 steel]] has a nominal [[Yield (engineering)|yield strength]] of 36,000 to 100,000&nbsp;pounds per square inch.</ref> (260 to 670&nbsp;MPa). The strength of the steel and thickness of the steel plates decreased with height because they were required to support lesser amounts of building mass on higher floors.<ref name="NIST-chapter1"/> The tube-frame design required 40 percent less structural steel than conventional building designs.<ref name="steel">{{cite journal |author=American Iron and Steel Institute |title=The World Trade Center - New York City |journal=Contemporary Steel Design |volume=1(4) |year=1964 |publisher=American Iron and Steel Institute}}</ref> From the 7th floor to the ground level, and down to the foundation, the columns were spaced 10&nbsp;feet (3&nbsp;m) apart.<ref>{{cite book |author=National Construction Safety Team |url=http://wtc.nist.gov/NISTNCSTAR1CollapseofTowers.pdf |format =PDF |title=Final Report on the Collapse of the World Trade Center Towers |publisher=NIST |date=September 2005 |pages=p. 10}}</ref> All columns were placed on [[bedrock]], which, unlike that in Midtown Manhattan, where the bedrock is shallow, is at 65&ndash;85&nbsp;feet (20&ndash;26&nbsp;m) below the surface.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.nae.edu/nae/bridgecom.nsf/weblinks/CGOZ-58NLJ9?OpenDocument |title=World Trade Center "Bathtub": From Genesis to Armageddon |journal=Bridges |author=Tamaro, George J. |date=Spring 2002 |volume=32(1)}}</ref>

The spandrel plates were welded to the columns to create the modular pieces off-site at the fabrication shop.<ref>{{cite book |author=National Construction Safety Team |url=http://wtc.nist.gov/NISTNCSTAR1CollapseofTowers.pdf |format =PDF |title=Final Report on the Collapse of the World Trade Center Towers |publisher=NIST |date=September 2005 |pages=p. 8}}</ref> The modular pieces were typically 52&nbsp;inches (1.3&nbsp;m) deep, and extended for two full floors and half of two more floors.<ref name="NIST-chapter1"/> Adjacent modules were bolted together, with the splices occurring at mid-span of the columns and spandrels. The spandrel plates were located at each floor, transmitting [[shear stress]] between columns, allowing them to work together in resisting lateral loads. The joints between modules were staggered vertically, so the column splices between adjacent modules were not at the same floor.<ref name="NIST-chapter1"/>

The building's core housed the elevator and utility shafts, restrooms, three stairwells, and other support spaces. The core of each tower was a rectangular area 87 by 135&nbsp;feet (27 by 41&nbsp;m), and contained 47 steel columns running from the bedrock to the top of the tower.<ref name="NIST-chapter1"/> The columns tapered with height, and consisted of welded box-sections at lower floors and rolled wide-flange sections at upper floors. The structural core in 1 WTC was oriented with the long axis east to west, while that of 2 WTC was oriented north to south. All elevators were located in the core. Each building had three stairwells, also in the core, except on the [[mechanical floor]]s where they were located outside the core.<ref>{{cite book |title=Design, Construction, and Maintenance of Structural and Life Safety Systems (NCSTAR 1-1) |publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology |pages=p. 8 |author=Lew, H.S., Richard W.

[[Image:Wtc floor truss system.png|thumb|left|Schematic of composite floor truss system]]
The large, column-free space between the perimeter and core was bridged by prefabricated floor trusses. The floors supported their own weight, as well as [[live loads]], provided lateral stability to the exterior walls, and distributed wind loads among the exterior walls. The floors consisted of 4&nbsp;inch (10&nbsp;cm) thick lightweight [[concrete]] slabs laid on a fluted steel deck. A grid of lightweight bridging trusses and main trusses supported the floors. The trusses had a span of 60&nbsp;feet (18.2&nbsp;m) in the long-span areas and 35&nbsp;feet (11&nbsp;m) in the short span area.<ref name="NIST-chapter1"/> The trusses connected to the perimeter at alternate columns, and were on 6&nbsp;foot 8&nbsp;inch (2.03&nbsp;m) centers. The top chords of the trusses were bolted to seats welded to the spandrels on the exterior side and a channel welded to the core columns on the interior side.  The floors were connected to the perimeter spandrel plates with [[Viscoelasticity|viscoelastic]] dampers, which helped reduce the amount of sway felt by building occupants. The trusses supported a 4&nbsp;inch thick (10&nbsp;cm) lightweight concrete floor slab, with shear connections for composite action.<ref name="NIST-chapter1"/>

Hat [[truss]]es (or "outrigger truss") located from the 107th floor to the top of the buildings were designed to support a tall communication [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]] on top of each building.<ref name="NIST-chapter1"/> Only 1 WTC (north tower) actually had an antenna fitted, which was added in 1978.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/newyork/sfeature/sf_building.html |title=New York: A Documentary Film - The Center of the World (Construction Footage) |publisher = Port Authority / PBS |accessdate=2007-05-16}}</ref> The truss system consisted of six trusses along the long axis of the core and four along the short axis. This truss system allowed some load redistribution between the perimeter and core columns and supported the transmission tower.

The tube frame design using steel core and perimeter columns protected with sprayed-on fire resistant material created a relatively lightweight structure that would sway more in response to the wind, compared to traditional structures such as the [[Empire State Building]] that have thick, heavy [[masonry]] for [[fireproofing]] of steel structural elements.<ref>{{cite book |title=City in the Sky |author=Glanz, James and Eric Lipton |pages=p. 138 |publisher=Times Books |year=2003}}</ref> During the design process, [[wind tunnel]] tests were done at [[Colorado State University]] and at the [[National Physical Laboratory, UK|National Physical Laboratory]] in the [[United Kingdom|U.K.]] to establish design wind pressures that the World Trade Center towers could be subjected to and structural response to those forces.<ref>{{cite book |title=Design and Construction of Structural Systems (NCSTAR 1-1A) |publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology |pages=p. 65 |author=Fanella, David A., Arnaldo T. Derecho, S.K. Ghosh |date=September 2005}}</ref> Experiments also were done to evaluate how much sway occupants could tolerate. Subjects were recruited for "free eye exams," while the real purpose of the experiment was to subject them to simulated building sway and find out how much they could comfortably tolerate.<ref>{{cite book |title=City in the Sky |author=Glanz, James and Eric Lipton |pages=p. 139-144 |publisher=Times Books |year=2003}}</ref> Many subjects did not respond well, experiencing [[dizziness]] and other ill effects. The chief engineer [[Leslie Robertson]] worked with Canadian engineer Alan G. Davenport to develop viscoelastic [[Damping|dampers]] to absorb some of the sway. These viscoelastic dampers, used throughout the structures at the joints between floor trusses and perimeter columns, along with some other structural modifications reduced the building sway to an acceptable level.<ref>{{cite book |title=City in the Sky |author=Glanz, James and Eric Lipton |pages=p. 160-167 |publisher=Times Books |year=2003}}</ref>

===Fire protection===
[[Fireproofing|Sprayed-fire resistant material]]s (SFRMs) were used to protect some structural steel elements in the towers, including all floor trusses and beams.<ref name="NCSTAR 1-1-p8">{{cite book |title=Design, Construction, and Maintenance of Structural and Life Safety Systems (NCSTAR 1-1) |publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology |pages=p. 8 |author=Lew, H.S., Richard W.

The 1968 New York City building codes did not require [[Fire sprinkler|sprinkler]]s for [[high-rise]] buildings, except for underground spaces. In accordance with building codes, sprinklers were originally installed only in the underground parking structures of the World Trade Center.<ref>{{cite book |title=Design, Construction, and Maintenance of Structural and Life Safety Systems (NCSTAR 1-1) |publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology |pages=p. 162 |author=Lew, H.S., Richard W.

==Construction==
In March 1965, the Port Authority began acquiring property at the World Trade Center site.<ref>{{cite news |title=Port Agency Buys Downtown Tract |author=Ingraham, Joseph C. |date=March 29, 1965 |publisher=The New York Times}}</ref>  The Ajax Wrecking and Lumber Corporation was hired for the [[demolition]] work, which began on [[March 21]] [[1966]] to clear the site for construction of the World Trade Center.<ref name="gillespie-p61">{{cite book |author=Gillespie, Angus K. |year=1999 |title=Twin Towers: The Life of New York City's World Trade Center |publisher=Rutgers University Press |pages=p. 61}}</ref>

This method was used in place of conventional dewatering methods because lowering the [[groundwater table]] would cause large [[groundwater-related subsidence|settlements]] of nearby buildings not built on [[deep foundation]]s.<ref>{{cite news |title=Tall Towers will Sit on Deep Foundations |last=Kapp |first=Martin S |publisher=Engineering News Record |date=July 9, 1964}}</ref>  The slurry method involves digging a [[trench]], and as [[excavation]] proceeds, filling the space with a "slurry" mixture, composed of [[bentonite]] which plugs holes and keeps water out.  When the trench was dug out, a steel cage was inserted, with concrete poured in, forcing the "slurry" out.  The "slurry" method was devised by Port Authority chief engineer John M. Kyle, Jr.  Towards the end of 1966, work began on building the slurry wall, led by [[Montreal]]-based Icanda, a subsidiary of an Italian engineering firm, Impresa Costruzioni Opere Specializzate (I.C.O.S.).<ref name="gillespie-p68">{{cite book |author=Gillespie, Angus K. |year=1999 |title=Twin Towers: The Life of New York City's World Trade Center |publisher=Rutgers University Press |pages=p. 68}}</ref>  It took fourteen months for the slurry wall to be completed, which was necessary before excavation of material from the interior of the site could begin.<ref name="gillespie-p68"/>  The original [[Downtown Hudson Tubes|Hudson Tubes]], which carried PATH trains into Hudson Terminal, remained in service as elevated tunnels until 1971 when a new [[World Trade Center (PATH station)|PATH station]] was built.<ref>{{cite news |author=Carroll, Maurice |title=A Section of the Hudson Tubes is Turned into Elevated Tunnel |date=December 30, 1968 |publisher=The New York Times}}</ref>

Extensive use of [[prefabrication|prefabricated]] parts for the perimeter framing and floor truss systems helped speed up the construction process and reduce costs, while providing greater [[quality control]].<ref name="steel"/>  Steel components were freighted into a [[Penn Central Transportation|Penn Central]] yard in [[Jersey City, New Jersey|Jersey City]].  From there, they were brought in early morning hours through the [[Holland Tunnel]] to the construction site, and lifted into place by a [[Crane (machine)|crane]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Trade Center is Doing Everything Big |publisher=The New York Times |date=June 6, 1969 |author=Kaufman, Micheal T.}}</ref>  Larger pieces were brought to the construction site by [[tugboat]]s.<ref name="gillespie-p88">{{cite book |author=Gillespie, Angus K. |year=1999 |title=Twin Towers: The Life of New York City's World Trade Center |publisher=Rutgers University Press |pages=p. 88}}</ref>  A special type of crane, suitable for constructing such tall buildings, that used [[hydraulics]] to lift components and provided its own power was used in construction of the World Trade Center.

==Other buildings==
The World Trade Center complex included four other smaller buildings constructed during the 1970s.  3 World Trade Center was a 22-story building, which was home to the [[Marriott World Trade Center]].  It was designed by [[Skidmore, Owings and Merrill]] in 1978<U+2013>79.<ref>{{cite book |author=McAllister, Therese, Johnathan Barnett, John Gross, Ronald Hamburger, Jon Magnusson |chapter=WTC3 |title=World Trade Center Building Performance Study |publisher=FEMA |date=May 2002}}</ref>  [[4 World Trade Center]], [[5 World Trade Center]], and [[6 World Trade Center]] were all 8<U+2013>9 story buildings that were designed by the same team as the Twin Towers, including Minoru Yamasaki, Emery Roth & Sons, and Skilling, Helle, Christiansen, Robertson.<ref>{{cite book |author=McAllister, Therese, Johnathan Barnett, John Gross, Ronald Hamburger, Jon Magnusson |chapter=WTC4, 5, and 6 |title=World Trade Center Building Performance Study |publisher=FEMA |date=May 2002}}</ref>  A seventh building ([[7 World Trade Center]]) was built in the mid-1980s, just to the north of the main World Trade Center site.

==Modifications==
Over time, numerous structural modifications were made to suit the needs of tenants in the Twin Towers. Modifications were made in accordance with the Port Authority's ''Tenant Alteration Review Manual'' and were reviewed by the Port Authority to ensure the changes did not compromise structural integrity of the buildings. In many instances, openings were cut in the floors to accommodate new stairways to connect tenant floors. Some steel beams in the core were reinforced and strengthened to accommodate heavy live loads, such as large amounts of heavy files that tenants had on their floors.<ref>{{cite book |title=Design, Construction, and Maintenance of Structural and Life Safety Systems (NCSTAR 1-1) |publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology |pages=p. xliv |author=Lew, H.S., Richard W.
