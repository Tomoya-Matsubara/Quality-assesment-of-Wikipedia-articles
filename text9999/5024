'''''Jurassic Park''''' is a [[1993 in film|1993]] [[science fiction film]] directed by [[Steven Spielberg]] and based on the [[Jurassic Park|novel of the same name]] by [[Michael Crichton]]. The film centers on the island of [[Isla Nublar]], where scientists have created an [[amusement park]] of [[cloned]] [[dinosaurs]]. John Hammond ([[Richard Attenborough]]) invites a group of scientists, played by [[Sam Neill]], [[Jeff Goldblum]] and [[Laura Dern]], to visit the park. Sabotage sets the dinosaurs on the loose, and technicians and visitors attempt to escape the island.

Development of the film began before the novel was even published, and Crichton was hired to contribute to a script that cut much of its story. Spielberg hired [[Stan Winston|Stan Winston Studios]]' puppets and worked with [[Industrial Light and Magic]] to develop cutting-edge [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] to portray the dinosaurs. ''Jurassic Park'' was well received by critics, although they criticized the characterization. During its release, the film grossed $914 million, becoming the most successful film yet released, and it is currently the [[List of highest-grossing films|eighth-highest grossing feature film]]. Most significantly, the film inspired a new breed of films that primarily used CGI for special effects. The film was followed by ''[[The Lost World: Jurassic Park]]'' in [[1997 in film|1997]] and by ''[[Jurassic Park III]]'' in [[2001 in film|2001]]. A [[Jurassic Park IV|fourth film]] is currently in development.

==Plot==
{{spoiler}}
<includeonly>Improve grammar, but don't extend it, plot is already complex</includeonly>
On Isla Nublar, an [[InGen]] employee is killed while releasing a ''[[Velociraptor]]'' into a penhold, prompting a lawsuit from his family. [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] [[List of characters in Jurassic Park#John Hammond|John Hammond]] is pressured by his investors to allow a safety investigation by experts before opening the park. He invites Drs. [[List of characters in Jurassic Park#Dr. Alan Grant|Alan Grant]] and [[List of characters in Jurassic Park#Dr. Ellie Sattler|Ellie Sattler]], as well as [[chaos theory|chaos theorist]] [[List of characters in Jurassic Park#Dr. Ian Malcolm|Dr. Ian Malcolm]] and his investors' attorney [[List of characters in Jurassic Park#Donald Gennaro|Donald Gennaro]], to perform the inspection. At the park, they learn that InGen recreated the dinosaurs by cloning genetic material found in [[mosquito]]es that fed on dinosaur blood, preserved in [[Dominican amber]]. The DNA from these samples was spliced with DNA from [[frog]]s to fill in gaps: during this process, the [[dinosaurs]] are bred as females to control the population. The team are also shown the pen containing the ferocious and intelligent adults.

[[Image:JurassicParkTREX.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The ''Tyrannosaurus'' escapes from her paddock.]]
Malcolm and Sattler are concerned, but Grant remains neutral. They meet Hammond's grandchildren, [[List of characters in Jurassic Park#Alexis "Lex" Murphy|Alexis]] and [[List of characters in Jurassic Park#Timothy "Tim" Murphy|Tim Murphy]], and go on a vehicular tour of the park. Ellie leaves the tour to take care of a sick ''[[Triceratops]]''. A storm hits the island and most InGen employees leave, except for Hammond, [[game warden]] [[List of characters in Jurassic Park#Robert Muldoon|Robert Muldoon]], chief [[Systems engineering|engineer]] [[List of characters in Jurassic Park#John Raymond Arnold|Ray Arnold]], and lead [[computer programmer]] [[List of characters in Jurassic Park#Dennis Nedry|Dennis Nedry]]. Commissioned by rival businessman [[Biosyn|Lewis Dodgson]], Nedry takes an opportunity to shut down the park's security system so he can steal dinosaur [[embryo]]s and deliver them to an auxiliary dock. Thus, a ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'' breaks through the  electric fence surrounding its pen, killing Gennaro, wounding Malcolm and then attacks Tim and Lex hiding in the car. The children and Grant only narrowly avoid being killed and eaten. Meanwhile, Ellie and Muldoon rescue Malcolm and are almost caught by the ''T. rex'' during an intense chase. Nedry crashes his car and after trying to fix it is killed by a ''[[Dilophosaurus]]''. Grant, Tim, and Lex spend the night in a tree and while hiking to safety the next morning discover some of the dinosaurs are actually breeding. Grant realizes that the frog DNA is responsible, as some species of frog are known to spontaneously change gender in a single-sex environment.

[[Image:JPvelociraptor.png|200px|thumb|left|A pair of ''[[Velociraptor]]'' enter the kitchen.]]
Arnold tries to hack Nedry<U+2019>s computer to turn the power back on and fails, so he leaves to turn it back on manually. Ellie and Muldoon follow after he fails to return and discover the raptors have escaped. Muldoon tells Ellie to go to the utility shed herself and turn the power back on while he hunts the raptors that have been stalking them. Muldoon is attacked and killed by a lurking raptor while Ellie escapes from another after discovering Arnold's remains. After managing to turn on the power and escaping the raptor, she meets up with Grant. They both go back to Malcolm and Hammond, and Grant grabs a shotgun after learning that two raptors have escaped their pen and a third has been contained. Lex and Tim narrowly escape two of the raptors in the kitchen and, using her computer skills, Lex reboots the mainframe in order to call Hammond to get a helicopter while Grant and Ellie hold off a raptor trying to open the door to the computer room. After a scuffle on top of the fossil exhibits where the raptors block their escape route, the ''Tyrannosaurus'' suddenly barges in and kills both raptors. Grant, Ellie, Lex and Tim climb into Hammond and Malcolm's jeep and leave. Grant says he will not endorse the park, a choice with which Hammond concurs. Flying away in the helicopter, the children fall asleep beside Grant, who contemplatively watches the birds flying nearby, the surviving relatives of the dinosaurs they escaped.

<!-- Keep spoilers to a minimum! The plot is for who gets eaten.-->
*'''[[Sam Neill]]''' as '''Dr. Alan Grant''': A [[paleontologist]] excavating ''[[Velociraptor]]'' [[fossils]] in the [[Montana]]n [[Badlands]]. He dislikes children, frightening one with a talon of a raptor, but he soon has to protect Hammond's grandchildren. Neill was Spielberg's original choice, but was busy. Spielberg then met [[Richard Dreyfuss]] and [[Kurt Russell]], who were too expensive, and [[William Hurt]] turned down the role.<ref>{{cite book | last = Don Shay | coauthors = Jody Duncan | title = The Making of Jurassic Park: An Adventure 65 million Years in the Making | publisher = Boxtree Limited | date = 1993 | pages = p.61 | id = ISBN 1-85283-774-8}}</ref> Spielberg then pushed back filming a month to let Neill play the character: he wound up only having a weekend's break between filming ''Family Pictures'' and ''Jurassic Park''.

== Production ==
[[Michael Crichton]] originally conceived a screenplay about a boy who recreates a dinosaur; he continued to wrestle with his fascination with dinosaurs and cloning until he began writing the novel ''[[Jurassic Park]]''.<ref>{{cite video | people = Michael Crichton | title = Michael Crichton on the Jurassic Park Phenomenon | medium = DVD | publisher = Universal | date = 2001}}</ref> Spielberg learned of the novel in October 1989 while he and Crichton were discussing a screenplay that would become the TV series ''[[ER (TV series)|E.R.]]''<ref name="mcbride"/> Before the book was published, Crichton put up a non-negotiable fee for $1.5 million as well as a substantial percentage of the gross. [[Warner Bros.]] and [[Tim Burton]], [[Columbia Tristar]] and [[Richard Donner]], and [[20th Century Fox]] and [[Joe Dante]] bid for the rights,<ref name="mcbride"/> but Universal eventually acquired them in May 1990 for Spielberg.<ref name="Production notes">DVD Production Notes</ref> 

Universal further paid Crichton $500,000 to adapt his own novel,<ref>{{cite news | title = Leaping Lizards | publisher = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | date = [[1990-12-07]] | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,318785,00.html | accessdate=2007-02-17}}</ref> which he finished by the time Spielberg was filming ''[[Hook (film)|Hook]]''. Crichton noted that, because the book was "fairly long", his script only had about 10<U+2013>20 percent of the content; scenes were dropped for budgetary and practical reasons.<ref name="Biodrowski"> Steve Biodrowski. ''[[Cinefantastique]]'' Magazine, Vol. 24, No.2, pg. 12, "Jurassic Park:  Michael Crichton"</ref> Concurrently, Spielberg hired [[Stan Winston]] to create the animatronic dinosaurs, [[Phil Tippett]] to create [[go motion]] dinosaurs for longshots, and [[Michael Lantieri]] and [[Dennis Muren]] to supervise the on-set effects and digital compositing respectively. Paleontologist [[Jack Horner (paleontologist)|Jack Horner]] supervised the designs, to help commit to Spielberg's desire of portraying the dinosaurs as animals rather than monsters. Horner dismissed the raptors' flicking tongues in Tippett's early animatics,<ref name="Earl doc">{{cite video | title = The Making of Jurassic Park <U+2014> Hosted by James Earl Jones | medium = VHS (currently available on DVD) | publisher = Universal | date = 1995}}</ref> complaining, "[The dinosaurs] have no way of doing that!" Based on Horner's complaint, Spielberg insisted that Tippett take the tongues out.<ref name="French"> Lawrence French.

[[Image:ClayRex.jpg|thumb|250px|A [[go motion]] test of the ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'' by [[Phil Tippett]]]]
After completing ''Hook'', Spielberg wanted to film ''[[Schindler's List]]''. [[Music Corporation of America|MCA]] president [[Sid Sheinberg]] greenlit the film on one condition: that Spielberg make ''Jurassic Park'' first. Spielberg later said, "He knew that once I had directed ''Schindler'' I wouldn't be able to do ''Jurassic Park''".<ref name="mcbride"/> Beginning October 1991, [[Malia Scotch Marmo]] rewrote the script from scratch over a five month period, merging Ian Malcolm with Alan Grant.<ref>Shay, Duncan, p.39<U+2013>42</ref> Winston's department created fully detailed models of the dinosaurs, before molding [[latex]] skins, which were folded over onto complex robotics.<ref name="Earl doc" /> Tippett created stop-motion animatics of major scenes, but, despite go-motion's attempts at motion blurs, Spielberg still found the end results unsatisfactory in terms of working in a [[live-action]] feature film.<ref name="Earl doc" /> Animators Mark Dippe and Steve Williams went ahead in creating a computer generated walk cycle for the ''T. rex'' skeleton and were approved to do more.<ref>Shay, Duncan, p.49</ref> When Spielberg and Tippett saw an animatic of the ''T. rex'' chasing a herd of ''Gallimimus'', Spielberg said, "You're out of a job," to which Tippett replied, "Don't you mean extinct?"<ref name="Earl doc" /> Spielberg later wrote both the animatic and his dialogue between him and Tippett into the script.<ref name="gallies">Shay, Duncan, p.134<U+2013>5</ref> 

Screenwriter [[David Koepp]] came on board afterward, starting afresh from Marmo's draft, and used Spielberg's idea of a cartoon shown to the visitors to remove much of the exposition that fills Crichton's novel.<ref name="koepp">Shay, Duncan, p.55<U+2013>6</ref> Spielberg also excised a sub-plot of ''[[Procompsognathus]]'' escaping to the mainland and attacking young children, as he found it too horrific.<ref>{{cite news | title = A TALE OF TWO 'JURASSICS' | publisher = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | date = [[1993-06-18]] | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,306930,00.html | accessdate = 2007-02-17}}</ref> In terms of characterization, Hammond was changed from a ruthless businessman to a kindly old man, as Spielberg admitted he identified with Hammond's obsession with showmanship.<ref name="lack of story?">McBride, p.421<U+2013>422</ref> He also switched the characters of Tim and Lex; in the book, Tim is aged 11 and into computers, and Lex is only seven or eight and into sports. Spielberg did this because he wanted to work with Joseph Mazello, and it also allowed him to introduce the subplot of Lex's adolescent crush on Grant.<ref name="casting"/> Koepp changed Grant's relationship with the children, making him hostile to them initially to allow for more [[characterization#Character development|character development]].<ref name="mcbride"/> Koepp also took the opportunity to cut out a major sequence from the book where the ''T. rex'' chases Grant and the children down a river before being tranquilized by Muldoon for budget reasons.<ref name="koepp"/> After two years and one month of pre-production, filming began on [[August 24]], [[1992]] on the [[Hawaii]]an island of [[Kauai|Kaua{{okina}}i]].<ref>Shay, Duncan, p.65 and 67</ref> The three week shoot involved various daytime exteriors.<ref name="Production notes" />  On September 11, [[Hurricane Iniki]] passed directly over Kaua{{okina}}i, which caused the crew to lose a day of shooting.<ref>Shay, Duncan, p.86</ref> The scheduled shoot of the ''Gallimimus'' chase was moved to [[Oahu]].<ref name="gallies" /> 

The crew moved back to the mainland U.S.A., to shoot at [[Universal Studios]]'s Stage 24, for scenes involving the raptors in the kitchen.<ref name="Production notes" /> The crew also shot on Stage 23 for the scenes involving the power supply before going on location to [[Red Rock Canyon State Park (California)|Red Rock Canyon]] for the [[Montana]] dig scenes.<ref name="location">Shay, Duncan, p.91<U+2013>92</ref> The crew returned to Universal to shoot Grant's rescue of Tim, using a fifty-foot prop with hydraulic wheels for the car fall, and the ''Brachiosaurus'' encounter.

Special effects work continued on the film, with Tippett's unit adjusting to new technology with Dinosaur Input Devices: models which fed information into the computers to allow themselves to animate the characters traditionally. In addition, they acted out scenes with the raptors and ''Gallimimus''. As well as the computer generated dinosaurs, ILM also created elements such as water splashing and digital face replacement for Ariana Richard's stunt double.<ref name="Earl doc" /> Spielberg monitored their progress from [[Poland]].<ref name="Hopefully the only double page ref">Shay, Duncan, p.138</ref> Composer [[John Williams]] began work on the [[Jurassic Park (film score)|score]] at the end of February, and it was [[Conducting|conducted]] a month later by John Neufeld and [[Alexander Courage]].<ref name="the end">Shay, Duncan p.144<U+2013>6</ref> The sound effects crew, supervised by [[George Lucas]],<ref>Shay, Duncan, p.123</ref> were finished by the end of April.

[[Image:JurassicPark-FilmRexCarPin02.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Stan Winston]]'s ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'' animatronic, on Warner Bros Stage 16]]
*'''''[[Tyrannosaurus]]''''', informally dubbed "T. Rex", is the star of the film according to Spielberg, being the reason he rewrote the ending for fear of disappointing the audience.<ref name="Earl doc" /> Winston's rex animatronic stood 20 feet, weighed 13,000 pounds,<ref name="triple cite"/> and was 40 feet long.<ref name="magic">{{cite news | author = [[Richard Corliss]] | title = Behind the Magic of Jurassic Park | publisher = [[Time (magazine)|TIME]] | date = [[1993-04-26]] | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,978307,00.html | accessdate = 2007-01-26}}</ref> Jack Horner called it "the closest I've ever been to a live dinosaur".<ref name="magic" /> The dinosaur is depicted with a vision based on movement. The rex's roar is a baby [[elephant]] mixed with a [[tiger]] and an [[alligator]] and its breath is a [[whale]]'s blowhole.<ref name="the end"/> A [[dog]] attacking a ball was used for the sounds of it tearing a ''Gallimimus'' apart.<ref name="Earl doc" />
*'''''[[Velociraptor]]''''', dubbed 'raptors' in the film, also have a major role, although those depicted are not based on the actual species in question, which is significantly smaller. It was instead based on its larger relative, ''[[Deinonychus]]'', which was at the time called ''Velociraptor antirrhopus'' by some scientists.<ref name="paul1988">Paul, G.S. 1988. ''Predatory Dinosaurs of the World.'' New York: Simon and Schuster. 464 pp.</ref> Crichton followed this theory, but by the time production of the film took place, the idea had been dropped. When the similar ''[[Utahraptor]]'' was discovered before the film's release, Stan Winston joked, "We made it, then they discovered it."<ref name="magic" /> For the attack on Robert Muldoon, the raptors were played by men in suits.<ref name="dilo" /> [[Dolphin]] screams, [[walrus]] bellowing, [[geese]] hissing, [[Crane (bird)|an African crane's]] mating call and human rasps were mixed to form various raptor sounds.<ref name="the end" /><ref name="Earl doc" /> Lastly, after the film's release, most paleontologists have concluded that dromaeosaurs like ''Velociraptor'' and ''Deinonychus'' had feathers,<ref name="paul2002">Paul, G.S. 2002. ''Dinosaurs of the Air: The Evolution and Loss of Flight in Dinosaurs and Birds.'' Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. 472 pp.</ref> though no direct fossil evidence of integument of any kind exists for ''Velociraptor'' itself.
*'''''[[Dilophosaurus]]''''' was also very different from its real life counterpart, made significantly smaller to make sure audiences did not confuse it with the raptors.<ref>Shay, Duncan, p.36</ref> Its frill and ability to spit venom are also fictional. Its vocal sounds were made by combining a [[swan]], a [[hawk]], and a [[rattlesnake]] together.<ref name="Earl doc" />
*'''''[[Brachiosaurus]]''''' is inaccurately depicted as chewing its food. Despite scientific evidence of them having limited vocal capabilities, sound designer [[Gary Rydstrom]] decided to represent them with [[whale song]]s and [[donkey]] calls to give them a melodic sense of wonder.<ref name="the end" /> 
*'''''[[Triceratops]]''''' has an extended cameo. Its appearance was a particular logistical nightmare for Stan Winston when Spielberg requested to shoot the animatronic of the sick creature earlier than expected.<ref>Shay, Duncan, p.83</ref> Winston also created a baby ''Triceratops'' for Ariana Richards to ride, which was cut from the film for pacing reasons.<ref>Shay, Duncan, p.64</ref> 
*'''''[[Gallimimus]]'''''' and '''''[[Parasaurolophus]]'''''' roles are mainly cameos, the latter appearing in the first encounter with the ''Brachiosaurus''.

==Reaction==
The film received modestly positive reviews. High praise was heaped on the visual effects, although there was a lot of criticism levelled at the characterization and departures from the book. [[Janet Maslin]] in ''[[The New York Times]]'' called it, "A true movie milestone, presenting awe- and fear-inspiring sights never before seen on the screen....On paper, this story is tailor-made for Mr. Spielberg's talents...[but] [i]t becomes less crisp on screen than it was on the page, with much of the enjoyable jargon either mumbled confusingly or otherwise thrown away."<ref>{{cite news | author=[[Janet Maslin]] | title = Screen Stars With Teeth To Spare | publisher = [[The New York Times]] | date = [[1993-06-11]] | url = http://movies2.nytimes.com/mem/movies/review.html?_r=1&title1=&title2=JURASSIC%20PARK%20%28MOVIE%29&reviewer=Janet%20Maslin&v_id=26808&pdate=19930611&oref=slogin | accessdate = 2007-02-04}}</ref>  In ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', [[Peter Travers]] described the film as "colossal entertainment - the eye-popping, mind-bending, kick-out-the-jams thrill ride of summer and probably the year....Compared with the dinos, the characters are dry bones, indeed.

Most significantly, when many filmmakers saw ''Jurassic Park'''s use of [[computer generated imagery]], they realized that many of their visions, previously thought unfeasible or too expensive, were now possible. [[Stanley Kubrick]] contacted Spielberg to direct ''[[A.I.
