The ''Paso Libertadores'',  also called '''Cristo Redentor''', is a [[mountain pass]] between [[Argentina]] and [[Chile]].  It is the main transport route out of chilean capital city [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]] into [[Mendoza, Argentina|Mendoza]] city in Argentina and so carries quite heavy traffic. 

From the Argentinian side the route to the pass is a slow, gentle incline until entering a tunnel at around 3500m through the mountains. On the Chilean side the slope has a far higher grade, and the road decends down a long series of switch-backs to make the decent.
