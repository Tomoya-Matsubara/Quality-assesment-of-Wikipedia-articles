'''Robyn Regehr''' (born April 19, 1980) is a [[Canada|Canadian]] professional [[ice hockey]] [[Defenceman (ice hockey)|defenceman]] for the [[Buffalo Sabres]] of the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL). He was a first round draft pick of the [[Colorado Avalanche]], selected 19th overall at the [[1998 NHL Entry Draft]], but was traded to Calgary while still playing junior hockey for the [[Kamloops Blazers]] of the [[Western Hockey League]] (WHL). He was a member of the [[Canada national men's ice hockey team|Canadian]] team at the [[2006 Winter Olympics]], and has won silver medals at the [[IIHF World U20 Championship|World Junior]] and [[Ice Hockey World Championships|Senior]] championships, as well as the championship at the [[2004 World Cup of Hockey]].  

Regehr was born in [[Brazil]], and spent his early childhood in [[Indonesia]] before his parents settled back in Canada. At 19, he was the youngest nominee for the [[Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy]] in NHL history after he made his NHL debut less than four months after suffering two broken legs in a serious automobile accident. He is best known for his strong defence and physical ability. His younger brother [[Richie Regehr|Richie]] briefly played with him on the Flames.

==Early life==
Regehr was born on April 19, 1980 in [[Recife]], [[Brazil]], the second son of Canadian [[Mennonite]] [[missionary|missionaries]] Ron and Edith Regehr.<ref>{{cite web |last=Lefebvre |first=Jim |url=http://www.faceoff.com/hockey/teams/calgary-flames/story.html?id=bea0b4d0-7be2-47cd-b635-48867dd4d41a&add_feed_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.canada.com%2Fcalgaryherald%2Fnews%2Fsports%2Fflames%2Ftopstories.atom%3Fviewer%3Dhttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.faceoff.com%2Fhockey%2Fteams%2Fcalgary-flames%2Fstory.html |title=Regehr signs up for African trip |work=Calgary Herald |date=2008-03-31 |accessdate=2009-12-05}}</ref> After three years in Brazil, he then spent four years living in [[Bandung]], [[Indonesia]],<ref name="SICrashBio">{{cite web |last=Kennedy |first=Kostya |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1017643/index.htm |title=No stopping him now |work=Sports Illustrated |date=1999-11-15 |accessdate=2009-12-05}}</ref> where his younger brother, [[Richie Regehr|Richie]] was born.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://flames.nhl.com/club/player.htm?id=8470346 |title=Richie Regehr player profile |publisher=Calgary Flames Hockey Club |accessdate=2009-12-07}}</ref> He also has an older brother and a sister.<ref>{{cite web |last=Sportak |first=Randy |url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Hockey/NHL/Calgary/2006/02/12/1438850-sun.html |title=Regehr finally excited |work=Calgary Sun |date=2006-02-12 |accessdate=2009-12-06}}</ref> The family finally settled back in Canada, at [[Rosthern, Saskatchewan]] around the time he turned seven.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/story/2008/12/15/minormemories-regehr.html |title=Robyn Regehr: My mom was always yelling at the refs |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |date=2008-12-15 |accessdate=2009-12-05}}</ref> Regehr quickly picked up the game of hockey, but was held back in his first year of minor hockey as he was starting the game three years behind other kids his age.

On June 23, 2011, due to the Flames needing to clear space under the league's [[salary cap]], the Flames asked Regehr to waive his no-movement clause in order to clear the way for a trade to the [[Buffalo Sabres]]; Regehr initially refused, instead desiring to see what other trade options there were.
