'''Joseph Robinette "Joe" Biden, Jr. ''' ({{pron-en|'d<U+0292>o<U+028A>s<U+025B>f r<U+0252>b<U+026A>'n<U+025B>t 'b<U+0430><U+026A>d<U+025B>n}}; born November 20, 1942) is the [[United States Senate#Seniority|senior]] [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] from [[Delaware]]. He is both the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[Vice President of the United States|vice presidential]] nominee for the [[United States presidential election, 2008|November 2008 election]] and a candidate for re-election in the U.S. Senate. 

Biden was born and raised in {{city-state|Scranton|Pennsylvania}} for ten years prior to moving to Delaware.  He became an attorney in 1969 and was elected to a [[County_council#United_States|county council]] in 1970.  Biden was first elected to the Senate in 1972; sworn in 1973 at the [[United States Constitution|Constitutional]] minimum age of 30, he became the fifth-youngest senator in U.S. history.  He was reelected to the Senate in 1978, 1984, 1990, 1996, and 2002.  He is a long-time member and current chairman of the [[United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations|Foreign Relations Committee]] and has worked on resolutions concerning the [[Yugoslav wars]] and [[Iraq War]].
He has served as chairman of the [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary|Senate Judiciary Committee]], dealing with issues related to [[drug policy]], crime prevention, and [[civil liberties]], and led creation of the [[Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act]] and [[Violence Against Women Act]].  He chaired the Judiciary Committee during the contentious [[U.S. Supreme Court]] nominations of [[Robert Bork]] and [[Clarence Thomas]].

Biden unsuccessfully sought the Democratic presidential nomination in [[United States presidential election, 1988|1988]] and [[Joe Biden presidential campaign, 2008|2008]], both times dropping out early in the process. In his sixth consecutive term in the Senate, Biden has served for the [[Seniority in the United States Senate|sixth-longest period among current senators.]]

[[Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2008|Barack Obama's presidential campaign]] announced that Biden would be [[Barack Obama|Obama's]] running mate for the 2008 U.S. presidential election. Biden officially accepted the nomination on August 27, 2008 at the [[2008 Democratic National Convention]] in {{city-state|Denver|Colorado}}.

==Family and early political career==
On August 27, 1966, while in law school, Biden married Neilia Hunter, who was from an affluent background in [[Skaneateles (village), New York|Skaneateles, New York]].<ref name="ap-timeline">{{cite news | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2008/08/22/politics/p222636D16.DTL | title=Timeline of Biden's life and career | publisher=[[Associated Press]] | date=2008-08-23 | accessdate=2008-09-06}}</ref><ref name="nyt-ease">{{cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/14/us/politics/14biden.html | title=Biden Campaigning With Ease After Hardships | author=[[Elisabeth Bumiller|Bumiller, Elisabeth]] | publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' | date=2007-12-14 | accessdate=2008-09-13}}</ref>  They had met in 1964 while on [[spring break]] in [[the Bahamas]], and he had overcome her parents' initial reluctance for her to be dating a Roman Catholic.<ref>Biden, ''Promises to Keep'', pp. 25, 28.<!--TBD doublecheck pg nos--></ref>  They had three children, [[Beau Biden|Joseph R.

In 1969, Biden began practicing law in [[Wilmington, Delaware]], and was soon elected to the [[New Castle County]], [[County council#United States|County Council]], where he served from 1970 to 1972.<ref name="cong-bio"/>

The [[U.S. Senate election, 1972|1972 U.S. Senate election]] presented Biden with a unique circumstance. Longtime Delaware political figure and [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] incumbent Senator [[J. Caleb Boggs]] was considering [[retirement]], which would likely have left [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] [[Pierre S. du Pont, IV|Pete du Pont]] and Wilmington Mayor [[Harry G. Haskell, Jr.]] in a divisive [[primary election|primary]] fight. To avoid that, [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Richard M. Nixon]] helped convince Boggs to run again with full party support.<ref>{{cite book |title = Only in Delaware, Politics and Politicians in the First State |last = Cohen |first = Celia |authorlink = |coauthors = |year = 2002 |publisher = Grapevine Publishing   |id =}} p. 199</ref>  Biden's campaign had virtually no money; it was managed by his sister Valerie Biden Owens (who would go on to manage his future campaigns as well) and staffed by other members of his family, and relied upon handed-out newsprint position papers.<ref name="npr-72">{{cite news | url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=14999603 | title=Biden's Road to Senate Took Tragic Turn | author=Naylor, Brian | publisher=[[NPR]] | date=2007-10-08 | accessdate=2008-09-12}}</ref>  Biden's campaign issues focused on withdrawal from Vietnam, the environment, civil rights, and "change".<ref name="npr-72"/>  His energy level, his attractive young family, and his ability to connect with voters' emotions gave Biden an advantage over the ready-to-retire Boggs.<ref name="aap08-bio"/>  Biden won the November 7, 1972 election in an upset by a margin of 3,162 votes.<ref name="npr-72"/>

When Biden did take office on January 3, 1973, at age 30, the minimum age to become a [[United States Senators|U.S. Senator]], he became the fifth-youngest senator in U.S. history.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/minute/Youngest_Senator.htm | title=Youngest Senator | publisher=[[United States Senate]] | accessdate=2008-08-25}}</ref> In 1974, then-freshman Senator Biden was named one of the ''200 Faces for the Future'' by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,879402-6,00.html |title=200 Faces for the Future|publisher=''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''|date =July 15, 1974|accessdate=2008-08-23}}</ref>

Biden has since won five additional terms, usually with about 60&nbsp;percent of the vote.<ref name="aap08-366"/> Biden spent 28 years as a junior senator due to the two-year seniority of his Republican colleague [[William V.

===Judiciary Committee===
Biden is a long-time member of the [[U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary]], which he chaired from 1987 until 1995 and on which he served as [[ranking member|ranking minority member]] from 1981 until 1987 and again from 1995 until 1997. In this capacity, he dealt with issues related to [[drug policy]], crime prevention, and [[civil liberties]]. 

While chairman, Biden presided over the two most contentious [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] confirmation hearings in history, those for [[Robert Bork]] in 1987 and [[Clarence Thomas]] in 1991.<ref name="autogenerated1">''Almanac of American Politics'' 2008, p. 364.</ref>  In the [[Robert_Bork_Supreme_Court_nomination|Bork hearings]], Biden stated his opposition to Bork soon after the nomination, reversing an approval in an interview of a hypothetical Bork nomination he had made the previous year and angering conservatives who thought he could not conduct the hearings dispassionately.<ref name="bronner">{{cite book | last=Bronner | first=Ethan | title=Battle for Justice: How the Bork Nomination Shook America | publisher=[[W.

Biden has been involved in crafting many federal crime laws over the last decade, including the [[Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act]] of 1994, also known as the Biden Crime Law, and the landmark [[Violence Against Women Act]] of 1994 (VAWA), which contains a broad array of measures to combat [[domestic violence]] and provides billions of dollars in federal funds to address [[gender]]-based crimes. In 2000, the Supreme Court ruled that the section of VAWA allowing a federal civil remedy for victims of [[gender]]-motivated violence exceeded Congress's authority and therefore was [[U.S. Constitution|unconstitutional]].<ref>{{citeweb|title=''United States v.

Biden was critical of the actions of [[United States Office of the Independent Counsel|Independent Counsel]] [[Ken Starr]] during the 1990s [[Whitewater controversy]] and [[Lewinsky scandal]] investigations, and said "it's going to be a cold day in hell" before another Independent Counsel is granted the same powers.<ref>''Almanac of American Politics'' 2000, p. 372.</ref>  Biden voted to acquit on both charges during the [[Impeachment of Bill Clinton]].

As chairman of the [[International Narcotics Control Caucus]], Biden wrote the laws that created the U.S. "[[Drug Czar]]", who oversees and coordinates national drug control policy. In April 2003 he introduced the controversial Reducing Americans' Vulnerability to Ecstasy Act, also known as the [[RAVE Act]]. He continues to work to stop the spread of "[[date rape]] drugs" such as [[Rohypnol]], and drugs such as [[ecstasy (drug)|Ecstasy]] and [[Ketamine]]. In 2004 he worked to pass a bill outlawing [[steroids]] like [[androstenedione]], the drug used by many [[baseball]] players.<ref name="autogenerated1" />

Biden's legislation to promote [[financial aid|college aid]] and [[student loan|loan]] programs allows families to deduct on their annual [[income tax]] returns up to $10,000 per year in higher education expenses. His "Kids 2000" legislation established a public/private partnership to provide computer centers, teachers, [[Internet]] access, and technical training to young people, particularly to low-income and at-risk youth.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://biden.senate.gov/newsroom/details.cfm?id=229820&&|title=Kids 2000 Program|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071223064751/http://biden.senate.gov/newsroom/details.cfm?id=229820&& |archivedate=2007-12-23|accessdate=2008-08-23}}</ref>

===Foreign Relations Committee===
Biden is also a long-time member and current chairman of the [[U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations]]. In 1997, he became the [[ranking member|ranking minority member]] and chaired the committee from June 2001 through 2003. When Democrats re-took control of the Senate following the [[U.S. Senate election, 2006|2006 elections]], Biden again assumed the top spot on the committee in 2007. His efforts to combat hostilities in the [[Balkans]] in the 1990s brought national attention and influenced presidential policy: traveling repeatedly to the region, he made one meeting famous by calling [[Serbian people|Serbian]] leader [[Slobodan Milosevic]] a "[[war crime|war criminal]]." He consistently argued for lifting the arms [[embargo]], training [[Bosniaks|Bosnian Muslims]], investigating [[war crime]]s and administering [[NATO]] air strikes. Biden's subsequent "lift and strike" resolution was instrumental in convincing President [[Bill Clinton]] to use military force in the face of systemic [[human rights]] violations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theiowacaucus.com/Presidential-Candidate-Profiles.php|title=Democratic Presidential Candidates|publisher=The Iowa Caucus|accessdate=2008-08-23}}</ref> Biden has also called on [[Libya]] to release [[political prisoner]] [[Fathi Eljahmi]].<ref>{{citeweb |url=http://biden.senate.gov/newsroom/details.cfm?id=255274|title=Biden Renews Call for Release of Libyan Political Prisoner|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071223060256/http://biden.senate.gov/newsroom/details.cfm?id=255274|archivedate=2007-12-23}}</ref>

In October 2002, Biden voted in favor of the [[Iraq Resolution|Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq]], justifying the [[Iraq War]]. He has long supported the appropriations to pay for the occupation, but has argued repeatedly that the war should be internationalized, that more soldiers are needed, and that the Bush administration should "level with the American people" about the cost and length of the conflict.<ref>''Almanac of American Politics'' 2008, p. 365.</ref>

In May 2008, Biden sharply criticized President [[George W. Bush]] for his speech to [[Israel]]'s [[Knesset]] in which he suggested that some Democrats were acting in the same way some Western leaders did when they appeased Hitler in the runup to World War II. Biden stating that "This is bullshit. This is malarkey. This is outrageous. Outrageous for the president of the United States to go to a foreign country, sit in the Knesset ... and make this kind of ridiculous statement." Biden later apologized for using the expletive. Biden further stated that "Since when does this administration think that if you sit down, you have to eliminate the word 'no' from your vocabulary?"<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/05/15/bush.dems/index.html | title=Dems fire back at Bush on 'appeasement' statement | author=Henry, Ed | publisher=[[CNN]] | date=May 16, 2008 | accessdate=2008-09-02}}</ref>

===Delaware issues===
Biden is a familiar figure to his Delaware constituency, by virtue of his daily train commuting from there,<ref name="autogenerated1"/>  and has generally sought to attend to state needs.<ref name="aap08-366"/>  Biden has been a strong supporter of increased [[Amtrak]] funding and rail security;<ref name="aap08-366"/> he hosts an annual Christmas dinner for the Amtrak crews.<ref name="aap08-366"/>  He has been an advocate for Delaware military installations, including [[Dover Air Force Base]] and [[New Castle County Air Guard Base]].<ref>{{cite press release | url=http://biden.creativengine.com/press/press_releases/release/?id=98f770c4-dc05-46e4-8c1d-09a3e379db76 | title= Senate Approves $24.4 Million for Guard, Dover Air Force Bases | publisher=[[United States Senate|Biden senate website]] | date=2005-09-23 | accessdate=2008-09-16}}</ref>

Biden has been a sponsor of [[bankruptcy]] legislation during the 2000s, which was sought by [[MBNA]], one of Delaware's largest companies, and other credit card issuers.<ref name="autogenerated1"/>  Biden fought for certain amendments to the bill that would indirectly protect homeowners and abortion rights; the overall bill was vetoed by Bill Clinton in 2000 but then finally passed as the [[Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act]] in 2005, with Biden supporting.<ref name="autogenerated1"/>  The downstate [[Sussex County, Delaware|Sussex County]] region is the nation's top chicken-producing area, and Biden held up trade agreements with [[Russia]] when that country stopped importing U.S. chickens.<ref name="aap08-366"/>

==Presidential campaigns==
Biden has twice run for the Democratic nomination for President, first in 1988, and again in 2008. Both times he was unsuccessful. He chose not to run in 1992 in part because he had voted against the resolution authorizing the [[Gulf War]].<ref name="aap08-366"/>  In 1996 [[Bill Clinton]] was an incumbent and in 2000 [[Al Gore]] a near-incumbent for the nomination.<ref name="aap08-366"/>  He considered joining the Democratic field of candidates for the [[U.S. presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential race]] but in August 2003 decided otherwise, saying he did not have enough time and any attempt would be too much of a long shot.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/ALLPOLITICS/08/11/biden/ | title=Sen.

==Political positions==
{{main|Political positions of Joe Biden}}
A method that political scientists use for gauging ideology is to compare the annual ratings by the [[Americans for Democratic Action]] (ADA) with the ratings by the [[American Conservative Union]] (ACU).<ref>{{citeweb|last=Mayer|first=William|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A28761-2004Mar27?language=printer|title=Kerry's Record Rings a Bell|publisher=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=2008-08-24}} "The question of how to measure a senator's or representative's ideology is one that political scientists regularly need to answer. For more than 30 years, the standard method for gauging ideology has been to use the annual ratings of lawmakers' votes by various interest groups, notably the Americans for Democratic Action (ADA) and the American Conservative Union (ACU)."</ref> Biden has a lifetime [[American liberalism|liberal]] 72 percent score from the ADA through 2004, while the ACU awarded Biden a lifetime [[American conservatism|conservative]] rating of 13 percent through 2007.<!-- Really want through 2007, but ADA does not supply lifetime averages, and have not yet found reliable media source for it--><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/judicial/2005-09-11-judiciarycommitteeprofiles_x.htm|title="Judging Judge Roberts: A look at the Judiciary Committee"], ''[[USA Today]]'', [[2005-09-12]].

Using another metric, Biden has a lifetime average liberal score of 77.5 percent, according to a ''[[National Journal]]'' analysis that places him ideologically among the center of Senate Democrats.<ref>{{cite web|title=Biden's Senate Vote Record|url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/conventions/co_20080823_9669.php|date=August 23, 2008|accessdate=2008-08-23|publisher=nationaljournal.com}}</ref> 
''[[The Almanac of American Politics]]'' rates congressional votes as liberal or conservative on the [[political spectrum]], in three policy areas: economic, social, and foreign. For 2005<U+2013>2006, Biden's average ratings were as follows: the economic rating was 80&nbsp;percent liberal and 13&nbsp;percent conservative, the social rating was 78&nbsp;percent liberal and 18&nbsp;percent conservative, and the foreign rating was 71&nbsp;percent liberal and 25&nbsp;percent conservative.<ref name="aap-08">''Almanac of American Politics'' 2008, p. 363. In 2005, the ratings were E 73 26, S 83 10, F 76 15; in 2006, E 87 0, S 73 26, F 65 34.</ref>

Various [[interest group]]s have given Biden scores or grades as to how well his votes align with the positions of each group.
The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) gives him an 86 percent lifetime score, with a 91 percent score for the current session of Congress.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://action.aclu.org/site/VoteCenter?congress=110&repId=199&session_num=0&page=legScore|title=ACLU Congressional Scorecard|publisher=[[American Civil Liberties Union]]|accessdate=2008-08-25}}</ref>

Biden was given a 100&nbsp;percent approval rating from [[AFL-CIO]] indicating a heavily pro-union voting record. Biden is opposed to the [[Social Security debate (United States)|privatization of Social Security]] and was given an 89&nbsp;percent approval rating from the [[Alliance for Retired Americans]] (ARA), an organization of retired union members.
