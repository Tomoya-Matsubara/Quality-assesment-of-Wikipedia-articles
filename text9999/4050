'''Joshua Holt Hamilton''' (born May 21, 1981, in {{city-state|Raleigh|North Carolina}}) is a [[Major League Baseball]] [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All Star]] [[outfielder]] for the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]]. 

Hamilton played baseball growing up in North Carolina. He was the first overall pick in the [[1999 Major League Baseball Draft]] by the [[Tampa Bay Rays|Tampa Bay Devil Rays]].<ref name = SI2 />  He was considered a [[Blue chip (sports)|blue chip]] prospect until injuries and a [[drug addiction]] derailed his career in 2001. Prior to the 2007 season, Hamilton was selected by the [[Chicago Cubs]] (picking for the [[Cincinnati Reds]]) in the [[Rule 5 Draft]].<ref name = "Rule5" />  He made his MLB debut in 2007 with the Reds and had a successful rookie season. During the off-season he was traded to the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] for [[Edinson Volquez]] & [[Daniel Ray Herrera|Danny Herrera]].<ref name = Trade1 />

After his torrid start to the [[2008 Major League Baseball season|2008 season]], Hamilton was named to the American League [[2008 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All Star team]]. He also participated in the [[2008 Major League Baseball Home Run Derby|Home Run Derby]], where he hit a record 28 home runs in the opening round and finished with 35 home runs, which was second most all-time in the derby history.<ref name = "HRDerby">{{cite web|url=http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5jzXEK41pcq1gfj96S8c-0C0VgK6AD91U24F00 | title=Hamilton has record round, but Morneau wins Derby | publisher = [[Associated Press|AP]] |date=[[2008-07-14]] | accessdate=2008-07-14}}</ref><ref name = "HRDerby2">{{cite web | title = Hamilton steals the show in defeat | url = http://www.miamiherald.com/sports/story/604980.html | author = Phillips, Mike | publisher = Miami Herald | date = 2008-07-15 | accessdate = 2008-07-15}}</ref>

==Minor leagues==
Hamilton signed with Tampa Bay receiving a $3.96 million [[signing bonus]], and joined their minor league system.<ref name = SI2>{{cite web | author = Chen, Albert | title = The Super Natural | date = 2008-05-27 | url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2008/writers/albert_chen/05/27/hamilton0602/ | accessdate = 2008-06-12}}</ref><ref name = USA1>{{cite web| author=Nightengale, Bob| title=Hamilton on the comeback trail| publication=USA Today| url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/al/devilrays/2006-06-06-hamilton-cover_x.htm| date=2006-06-07| accessdate=2007-06-03}}</ref> His first stop in the minors was the rookie level [[Princeton Devil Rays]] of the [[Appalachian League]] where he played 56 games. He also joined the [[Hudson Valley Renegades]], and helped lead them to their first [[New York-Penn League]] championship. After this successful debut in professional baseball, he spent the {{by|2000}} season with the [[Charleston RiverDogs]] in the [[South Atlantic League]].<ref name="bcube">{{cite web | title = Josh Hamilton Statistics | url=http://www.thebaseballcube.com/players/H/josh-hamilton.shtml | accessdate = 2008-06-12}}</ref>  At the start of his pro career, Hamilton's parents quit their jobs so they could travel with their son.<ref name = "WPost">{{cite web |author = Sheinin, Dave | title = New Life at the Plate | publication = Washington Post | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/12/AR2007021201312.html | date = 2007-02-13 | accessdate = 2008-06-13}}</ref>

Prior to the {{by|2001}} season, Hamilton was involved in a car accident.  His mother and father were also injured in the accident, and she went home with her husband to recuperate from their injuries. The 2001 season was also when he began experimenting with drugs and made his first attempt at rehab.<ref name="WPost" />  Hamilton only played 45 games in the 2001 season, split between Charleston (A-Ball) and the [[Orlando Rays]], a AA team in the [[Southern League (baseball)|Southern League]]. Hamilton began the {{by|2002}} season with the [[Bakersfield Blaze]], [[Batting average|batting]] .303 with 9 [[home run]]s and 44 [[Run batted in|RBI]] in 56 games before his season came to an end due to lingering toe and neck injuries.<ref name="bcube" />

At the start of the {{by|2003}} season, Hamilton showed up late several times during spring training and was reassigned to the team's minor league camp. He left the team and resurfaced several times, but eventually took the rest of the season off for personal reasons. Hamilton was hoping to return to spring training with the [[2004 Tampa Bay Devil Rays season|Devil Rays]] in {{by|2004}}, but he was suspended 30 days and fined for violating the drug policy put in place by MLB. Because of the length of his suspension, and the terms of the drug policy, Hamilton must have failed two or more drug tests after being put into the program. A 'failed' test is a positive result for a drug more severe than [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]].<ref name = "BA1">{{cite web | author = Topkin, Mark | title = Josh Hamilton Suspended For MLB Drug Policy Violations | publication = Baseball America | url = http://www.baseballamerica.com/today/news/040218hamilton.html | date = 2004-02-18 |accessdate = 2008-06-13}}</ref>  This suspension was increased several times after repeated violations of the terms of the program.<ref name = "detnews">{{cite web | author = Paul, Tony | title = Back from the (nearly) dead | publication = The Detroit News | url=http://www.detnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080606/OPINION03/806060396 | date = 2008-06-06 | accessdate = 2008-06-13}}</ref>

From [[2004 Major League Baseball season|2004]] until {{by|2006}}, Hamilton did not play baseball at all. He made several attempts at rehab, and started off the {{by|2005}} season with hopes of being a star major league outfielder.  <ref name = "TB">{{cite web | author = Topkin, Mark | title = Staying clean a day at a time | publication = St. Petersburg Times | url = http://www.sptimes.com/2005/01/14/Rays/Staying_clean_a_day_a.shtml | date = 2005-01-14 |accessdate = 2008-06-13}}</ref>  His return to baseball was helped along by former minor league outfielder and manager [[Roy Silver]], who owns a baseball academy in Florida. After hearing about Hamilton's desire to return to baseball, Silver offered the use of his facility if Hamilton agreed to work there. After several months there, Hamilton attempted to play with an independent minor league team, but MLB stepped in and disallowed it. Hamilton was allowed to work out with the Devil Rays minor league players starting on June 2, 2006. By the end of the month, he was allowed to participate in minor league games.<ref name="USA1" /><ref name="detnews" />  He played 15 games with the [[Hudson Valley Renegades]] at the end of the 2006 season.<ref name="bcube" /><ref name = "heraldnet">{{cite web | title = The Natural | url = http://www.heraldnet.com/article/20080714/SPORTS/282343154/-1/RSS04 |author = Davidoff, Ken | publisher = The Daily Herald Co. | date = 2008-07-14 | accessdate = 2008-07-14}}</ref>  In addition to returning to baseball, Hamilton also served as a cautionary tale for his young teammates with the Renegades. Rick Zolzer, the Renegades' director of special events said of Hamilton: ""He pointed (the other players) in the right direction. He said, 'Don't make the mistakes I made.' He was so good with all of the young kids."<ref name = "heraldnet" />

Left off the Devil Rays' [[40-man roster]], Hamilton was selected third overall <ref name = "Rule5">{{cite web| title=Major League Rule 5 Draft Selections| publication=Baseball America| url=http://www.baseballamerica.com/today/prospects/news/262980.html| date=2006-12-07| accessdate=2007-12-06}}</ref> in the 2006 [[Rule 5 Draft]].

==Cincinnati Reds (2007)==
In order to retain the rights to Hamilton, the [[Cincinnati Reds|Reds]] had to keep him on their Major League [[25-man roster]] for the entire 2007 season. He was one of the Reds' best hitters in spring training, leaving camp with a .403 batting average. As a result, he won a spot on the [[2007 Cincinnati Reds season|Reds']] Opening Day roster;<ref>{{cite web| author=Encina, Eduardo A. | title=Reds' Hamilton to start in majors| publication=Tampa Bay/St. Petersburg Times| url=http://www.sptimes.com/2007/03/31/Sports/Reds__Hamilton_to_sta.shtml| date=2007-03-31| accessdate=2007-04-02}}</ref> the Reds planned to use him as a fourth outfielder.<ref>{{cite web| author=Sheldon, Mark| title=Reds aim to build on last season's run| publication=Mlb.com| url=http://cincinnati.reds.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070327&content_id=1862217&vkey=news_cin&fext=.jsp&c_id=cin| date=2007-03-30| accessdate=2007-04-02}}</ref> Hamilton started most of the time in [[center field]] after an injury to [[Ryan Freel]].

In that game, he recorded his first Major League [[Hit (baseball)|hit]], a home run off Edgar Gonzalez. The next night, he hit another. Hamilton was named the [[National League]] [[Rookie of the Month]] for April.

On May 22, the Reds placed Hamilton on the 15-day [[disabled list]] with [[gastroenteritis]]; they activated him on June 5 after he batted .333 (8-for-24) with four home runs and six RBI in a six-game Minor League rehabilitation assignment.<ref>{{cite web| author=Sheldon, Mark| title=Hamilton to be activated from DL| url=http://cincinnati.reds.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070604&content_id=2005116&vkey=news_cin&fext=.jsp&c_id=cin| date=2007-06-05| accessdate=2007-06-05}}</ref> Hamilton went back on the DL on [[July 12]] with a sprained wrist.<ref>{{cite web| author=Sheldon, Mark| title=Notes: Ten more days for Hamilton | url=http://cincinnati.reds.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070716&content_id=2090159&vkey=news_cin&fext=.jsp&c_id=cin| date=2007-07-16 | accessdate=2007-07-22}}</ref>
