[[Image:List of countries without armed forces.png|thumb|right|400px|Countries without an army.]]
This is a '''list of countries without [[armed forces]]'''. The term "country" is used in the sense of [[Independence|independent state]]; thus, it applies only to [[sovereignty|sovereign]] [[state]]s and not [[List of dependent territories|dependencies]] whose defense is the responsibility of another country or an army alternative. The term "armed forces" refers to any government-sponsored [[Defense (military)|defense]] used to further the [[Domestic policy|domestic]] and [[Foreign policy|foreign]] policies of their respective government.{{ref|armed forces|A}} Some of the countries listed, such as [[Iceland]], [[San Marino]], and [[Saint Kitts and Nevis]], have no armed forces, but still have a non-police [[Military|military force]].<ref name="iceland" /><ref name="san marino"/><ref name="rss" />

Countries listed here typically have had a long-standing agreement with a former occupying country; for instance, the case between [[Monaco]] and [[France]], which has [[History of Monaco|existed for at least 300 years]].<ref name="monaco" /> [[Monaco]], [[Marshall Islands]], [[Micronesia]], and [[Palau]] have no say in their respective country's defense matters, and have little say in [[international relations]].<ref name="monaco" /><ref name="marshall islands" /><ref name="micronesia" /><ref name="palau" /> For example, when Micronesia negotiated a defensive agreement with the United States, it did so from a weak position because it had grown heavily dependent on American assistance.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2008-03-01|url=http://japanfocus.org/products/details/2493|title=Micronesia and the Postwar Remaking of the Asia Pacific: <U+201C>An American Lake<U+201D> |publisher=Japan Focus|author=Hara, Kimie }}</ref> [[Andorra]] can request defensive aid if necessary, while [[Iceland]] had a [[Iceland Defense Force|unique agreement]] with the [[United States]] that lasted until 2006, which requires them to provide defense to Iceland when needed.<ref name="iceland" /><ref name="andorra" /> The remaining countries are responsible for their own defense, and operate without any armed forces. Some of the countries, such as [[Costa Rica]], [[Dominica]], and [[Grenada]], underwent a process of [[demilitarization]].<ref name="rss" /><ref name="costa rica" /> Other countries were formed without armed forces, such as [[History of Andorra|Andorra over 700 years ago]];<ref name="andorra" /> the primary reason being that they were, or still are, under protection from another nation at their point of independence. All of the countries on this list are considered to be in a situation of "non-militarization."<ref name="non-military">{{cite web|accessdate=2008-02-27|url=http://www.demilitarisation.org/Countrieswithoutarmy.htm|title=Non-militarization |publisher=Demilitarization }}</ref>
