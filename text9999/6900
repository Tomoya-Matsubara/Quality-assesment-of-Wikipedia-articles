'''Professor Bernard Quatermass''' is a fictional scientist, originally created by the writer [[Nigel Kneale]] for [[BBC One|BBC Television]].  An intelligent and highly moral British scientist, Quatermass is a pioneer of the [[British space programme]], heading up the British Experimental Rocket Group.  He continually finds himself confronting sinister alien forces that threaten to destroy humanity.

Quatermass appeared in three influential BBC [[science fiction on television|science fiction serials]] of the 1950s, and returned in a final serial for [[Thames Television]] in 1979. A remake of the first serial appeared on [[BBC Four]] in 2005.  The character also appeared in films, on the radio and in print over a fifty-year period. Kneale picked the character's unusual surname from a [[London]] telephone directory, while the first name was in honour of the astronomer [[Bernard Lovell]].

The character of Quatermass has been described by [[BBC News Online]] as Britain's first television hero,<ref name="knealeobit">{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6105578.stm|title=Quatermass creator dies, aged 84|publisher=[[BBC News Online]]|date=2006-11-01|accessdate=2007-05-08}}</ref> and by ''[[The Independent]]'' newspaper as "A brilliantly conceived and finely crafted creation&nbsp;...

In Nigel Kneale's 1996 radio serial ''[[The Quatermass Memoirs]]'', it is revealed that the Professor was first involved in rocketry experiments in the 1930s, and that his wife died at a young age.<ref name="memoirs1">{{cite episode|title=Episode 1|series=The Quatermass Memoirs|serieslink=The Quatermass Memoirs|credits=Writer - [[Nigel Kneale]]; Producer - Paul Quinn|network=[[BBC Radio 3]]|city=[[London]]|airdate=1996-03-04}}</ref> The unmade [[prequel]] serial ''Quatermass in the Third Reich'', an idea conceived by Kneale in the late 1990s, would have shown Quatermass travelling to [[Nazi Germany]] during the [[1936 Summer Olympics|1936 Berlin Olympics]] and becoming involved with [[Wernher von Braun]] and the German rocket programme, before helping a young [[Jewish]] refugee to escape from the country.<ref name="murray188">Murray, p. 188.</ref> According to ''The Quatermass Memoirs'', during [[World War II]] Quatermass conducted top secret work for the [[Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II|British war effort]], which he subsequently refused ever to discuss.<ref name="memoirs1"/>

By 1953 Quatermass is the head of the British Experimental [[Rocket]] Group, which has a programme to launch a manned rocket into space from a base in Tarooma, Australia. Although Quatermass succeeds in launching a three-man crew, the rocket vastly overshoots its projected orbit and returns to Earth much later than planned, crash-landing in [[London]].<ref name="quatexp1"/> Only one of the crew, Victor Carroon, remains, and he has been taken over by an alien presence, eventually forcing Quatermass to destroy him and the other two crewmembers who have been absorbed into him in a climax set in [[Westminster Abbey]].<ref name="quatexp6">{{cite episode|title=State of Emergency|series=The Quatermass Experiment|serieslink=The Quatermass Experiment|credits=Writer - [[Nigel Kneale]]; Producer/director - [[Rudolph Cartier]]|network=[[BBC One|BBC]]|city=[[London]]|airdate=1953-08-22}}</ref>

Despite this trauma, Quatermass continues with his space programme, and by ''[[Quatermass II]]'' (1955) is actively planning the establishment of [[Colonization of the Moon|Moon bases]].<ref name="quatII1">{{cite episode|title=The Bolts|series=Quatermass II|serieslink=Quatermass II|credits=Writer - [[Nigel Kneale]]; Producer/director - [[Rudolph Cartier]]|network=[[BBC One|BBC]]|city=[[London]]|airdate=1955-10-22}}</ref> In this serial we see his daughter, Paula Quatermass, who works as an assistant at the Rocket Group, but there is no sign of a wife or other children.

At the beginning of the third serial, ''[[Quatermass and the Pit]]'' (1958&ndash;59), Quatermass's funding is being cut back and the Rocket Group is being handed over to military control, much to his disgust.<ref name="quatpit1">{{cite episode|title=The Halfmen|series=Quatermass and the Pit|serieslink=Quatermass and the Pit|credits=Writer - [[Nigel Kneale]]; Producer/director - [[Rudolph Cartier]]|network=[[BBC One|BBC]]|city=[[London]]|airdate=1958-12-22}}</ref> Command is to be handed over to Colonel Breen and Quatermass senses that he is being forced out: however, after the events of the serial, Breen is dead, Quatermass has helped to save the world, and London is in chaos.<ref name="quatpit6">{{cite episode|title=Hob|series=Quatermass and the Pit|serieslink=Quatermass and the Pit|credits=Writer - [[Nigel Kneale]]; Producer/director - [[Rudolph Cartier]]|network=[[BBC One|BBC]]|city=[[London]]|airdate=1959-01-26}}</ref>

It is not clear what happens to the Rocket Group immediately after this: the next time Quatermass is seen on screen (''[[Quatermass (TV serial)|Quatermass]]'', 1979) he has long been retired, living in retreat in the [[Scottish Highlands]]. He has recently become the guardian of his teenaged granddaughter, Hettie, after her parents were killed in a road accident in Germany.<ref name="quat41">{{cite episode|title=Ringstone Round|series=Quatermass|serieslink=Quatermass (TV serial)|credits=Writer - [[Nigel Kneale]]; Producer - [[Ted Childs]]; Director - [[Piers Haggard]]|network=[[ITV]]|city=[[London]]|airdate=1979-10-24}}</ref> After Hettie runs away from home he travels to London in search of her, and finds a [[dystopia]]n world there.

He presses the button to detonate it himself, with Hettie's help, and they are killed in the blast as the planet is saved.<ref name="quat44">{{cite episode|title=An Endangered Species|series=Quatermass|serieslink=Quatermass (TV serial)|credits=Writer - [[Nigel Kneale]]; Producer - [[Ted Childs]]; Director - [[Piers Haggard]]|network=[[ITV]]|city=[[London]]|airdate=1979-11-14}}</ref>

==History==
Nigel Kneale conceived the character of Quatermass in 1953, when he was assigned in his capacity as a BBC television staff drama writer to create a new six-part serial to run on Saturday nights in July and August.<ref name="pixley3">Pixley, p. 3.</ref> Kneale initially named his leading character Professor Charlton,<ref name="murray28">Murray, p. 28.</ref> but during the writing process decided he wanted something more striking and memorable.<ref name="pixley5">Pixley, p. 5.</ref> A native of the [[Isle of Man]], he was inspired by the fact that surnames beginning with "Qu" were common on the island.<ref name="pixley6">Pixley, p. 6.</ref> The eventual name was picked from a London [[telephone directory]]; there was a family of that name who traded as [[Greengrocer|fruiterers]] in the city's [[East End of London|East End]].<ref name="pixley5"/> The surname has its origins as a measurement of land assigned in the division of England by the [[Normans]] following their conquest of the country under [[William I of England|William the Conqueror]] in 1066.<ref name="murray28"/> The Professor's first name, Bernard, was in honour of the astronomer [[Bernard Lovell]], founder of the [[Jodrell Bank]] observatory.<ref name="pixley6"/>

The [[television director|director]] assigned to the serial, which was eventually named ''The Quatermass Experiment'', was [[Rudolph Cartier]]. A few months beforehand he had directed a play entitled ''It Is Midnight, Dr. Schweitzer'' for the BBC, and he offered the role of Quatermass to one of the stars of that play, [[Andr<U+00E9> Morell]].<ref name="murray28"/> Morell considered the offer but declined the part, which Cartier then offered to another actor who had appeared in ''It Is Midnight, Dr. Schweitzer'', [[Reginald Tate]], who accepted.<ref name="murray28"/>

The serial was a success, with the [[British Film Institute]] later describing it as "one of the most influential series of the 1950s."<ref name="bfi">{{cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/471469/index.html|title=Quatermass Experiment, The (1953)|first=Gavin|last=Collinson|publisher=[[Screenonline]]|accessdate=2007-05-08}}</ref> The following year the BBC's Controller of Programmes, [[Cecil McGivern]]<U+2014>who had initially feared that viewers would not accept such an unusual name for the leading character<ref name="pixley6"/><U+2014>noted in reference to the impending launch of the rival [[ITV]] network that: "Had competitive television been in existence then, we would have killed it every Saturday night while [''The Quatermass Experiment''] lasted. We are going to need ''many'' more 'Quatermass Experiment' programmes."<ref name="johnson21">Johnson, p. 21.</ref>

A sequel, ''[[Quatermass II]]'', was accordingly commissioned in 1955, but Reginald Tate died of a [[heart attack]] only a month before production was due to begin.<ref name="pixley1718">Pixley, pp. 17&ndash;18.</ref> With very little time to find a replacement, [[John Robinson (actor)|John Robinson]] was picked as the only suitable actor available.<ref name="pixley1718"/> Robinson was uncomfortable about taking over from Tate and with some of the technical dialogue he was required to deliver, and his performance has been criticised as "robotic",<ref name="2book6">Hearn & Rigby, p. 6.</ref> although others such as Andrew Pixley in ''Time Screen Magazine'' praised Robinson for doing compelling work after the initial episode of the serial.

By the summer of 1957, Kneale was working on the scripts for a third and final BBC serial.<ref name="pixley27">Pixley, p. 27.</ref> Titled ''Quatermass and the Pit'' and again produced and directed by Cartier, this was eventually broadcast in December 1958 and January 1959.<ref name="pixley47">Pixley, p. 47.</ref> John Robinson was no longer available to play Quatermass, so the role was offered instead to [[Alec Clunes]].<ref name="murray67">Murray, p. 67.</ref> Clunes turned down the part, and it was offered once more to Andr<U+00E9> Morell, who this time accepted.<ref name="murray67"/> Morell has been praised by several reviewers as having given the definitive portrayal of Quatermass.<ref name="murray67"/><ref name="heaven">{{cite book|title=TV Heaven|first=Jim|last=Sangster|coauthors=Paul Condon|year=2005|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|location=London|chapter=The Quatermass series|pages= 596<U+2013>601|isbn=0-00-719099-9}}</ref> The serial itself has been praised by the [[bbc.co.uk|BBC's own website]] as "simply the first finest thing the BBC ever made.

Of the TV serials, ''Quatermass II'' and ''Quatermass and the Pit'' have been preserved in full. Only the first two episodes of ''The Quatermass Experiment'' now exist.

[[Image:Andrewkeir.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Andrew Keir]] as Quatermass in the ''[[Quatermass and the Pit (film)|Quatermass and the Pit]]'' (1967) film.]]
At roughly the same time as ''Quatermass II'' was being transmitted by the BBC, [[Hammer Film Productions]] released their film adaptation of the first serial in British cinemas.<ref name="pixley21">Pixley, p. 21.</ref> Directed by [[Val Guest]], it was retitled ''[[The Quatermass Xperiment]]'', and starred American actor [[Brian Donlevy]] as part of a deal to help the film find US distribution.<ref name="murray45">Murray, p. 45.</ref> Kneale, who had little involvement with the film, was unimpressed with this casting. "I may have picked Quatermass's surname out of a phone book, but his first name was carefully chosen: Bernard, after Bernard Lovell, the creator of Jodrell Bank. Pioneer, ultimate questing man. Donlevy played him as a mechanic, a creature with a completely closed mind."<ref name="2book7">Hearn & Rigby, p. 7.</ref> Val Guest has praised Donlevy's performance, saying that "he gave it absolute reality."<ref name="kinsey35">Kinsey, p. 35.</ref>

Despite Kneale's reservations about the casting, ''The Quatermass Xperiment'' was the highest-grossing film Hammer had made up to that point in their history,<ref name="2book6"/> and has since been described by one academic as "the key British science fiction film of the 1950s."<ref name="hunter8">Hunter, p. 8.</ref> Hammer were keen to make an immediate follow-up, and wanted to use Quatermass in their 1956 film ''[[X the Unknown]]''; however, Kneale refused them the rights, and they created their own substitute character, Doctor Adam Royston.<ref name="kinsey41">Kinsey, p. 41.</ref> They did release an adaptation of ''Quatermass II'' in 1957, called ''[[Quatermass 2]]'' and this time with Kneale's involvement in the script.<ref name="kinsey50">Kinsey, p. 50.</ref> To the writer's displeasure, Donlevy returned as Quatermass.<ref name="kinsey50"/>

Hammer also purchased the film rights to [[Quatermass and the Pit (film)|''Quatermass and the Pit'']] (released in the USA as ''Five Million Years to Earth''), as it had done with the previous two TV serials, although they did not release [[Quatermass and the Pit (film)|their version]] until 1967.<ref name="pixley39">Pixley, p. 39.</ref> This time the film was directed by [[Roy Ward Baker]] and starred Scottish actor [[Andrew Keir]], after Morell had been offered and declined the chance to play the part again.<ref name="murray95">Murray, p. 95.</ref> Keir's performance was well-received, particularly in contrast to Donlevy's portrayal. ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper wrote in 1997 that: "Keir also made many films&nbsp;... most gratifyingly, perhaps, the movie version of ''Quatermass and the Pit'' (1967), when he finally replaced the absurdly miscast Brian Donlevy."<ref name="keirguard">{{cite news|title=Obituary: Formidable regular on the small screen: Andrew Keir|first=Philip|last=Purser|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=1997-10-07|page=14}}</ref>

Soon after the release of the ''Quatermass and the Pit'' film, Kneale was approached by Hammer about writing a fourth Quatermass story directly for them, but the idea came to nothing.<ref name="pixley39"/>

Possible remakes of one or more of the Hammer film adaptations were also mooted at various points during the 1990s, with [[Dan O'Bannon]] scripting a potential new version of ''The Quatermass Experiment'' in 1993, but again nothing was eventually filmed.<ref name="murray183185">Murray, pp. 183&ndash;185.</ref> In February 2012 [[Simon Oakes]], president of the revived [[Hammer Films]], announced that a new Quatermass film was in active development.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.darkhorizons.com/news/23051/hammer-films-reboot-quartermass-dracula|title=Hammer Films Reboot "Quartermass," Dracula?|first=Garth|last=Franklin|date=12 February 2012|accessdate=15 February 2012|publisher=[[Dark Horizons]]}}</ref>

By the early 1970s Kneale was once again regularly writing for the BBC, who announced plans to produce a fourth ''Quatermass'' serial in 1972.<ref name="bbc4">{{cite news|title=Quatermass and Quixote in BBC drama plans|first=Chris|last=Dunkley|publisher=[[The Times]]|date=1972-11-15|page=19}}</ref> This was not in the event made by the BBC, but Kneale's scripts did see production in 1979, as a four-part serial for [[Thames Television]] called ''[[Quatermass (TV serial)|Quatermass]]''.<ref name="q79">{{cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/442672/index.html|title=Quatermass (1979)|first=Mark|last=Duguid|publisher=[[Screenonline]]|accessdate=2007-01-31}}</ref> This time [[John Mills]] played Quatermass in an expensive and high-profile production, which was screened on the ITV network.<ref name="murray140">Murray, p. 140.</ref> The production company [[Euston Films]] also released a 100 minute film version, renaming it ''The Quatermass Conclusion'', for distribution abroad. There was, however, little interest among film distributors, and it received only a limited theatrical release.

Kneale was not keen to return to the character following this, telling one interviewer: "I blew him up&nbsp;... and I don't feel inclined to invent a 'Son of Quatermass' either."<ref name="pixley40">Pixley, p. 40.</ref> However, in the late 1990s he conceived an idea for a prequel serial, entitled ''Quatermass in the Third Reich'' and set in Germany in the 1930s.

==Other media==
In addition to the character's various television and film appearances, Quatermass was also seen in a variety of other media between the 1950s and the 1990s. In 1955 Kneale was invited by the publishers of the ''[[Daily Express]]'' to write a new [[prose]] Quatermass story for serialisation in their newspaper; as he was unable to think of a new storyline, they suggested he simply adapt ''Quatermass II'', which he agreed to.<ref name="pixley24">Pixley, p. 24.</ref> The serialisation ran in the ''Daily Express'' from 5 December 1955 to 20 December 1955, although Kneale was forced to draw it to a rapid conclusion when the paper lost interest in the project and instructed him to complete the story as soon as possible.<ref name="pixley26">Pixley, p. 26.</ref>

A script book for ''The Quatermass Experiment'', including some photographs from the production, was released by [[Penguin Books]] in 1959.<ref name="pixley38">Pixley, p. 38.</ref> This was followed by similar releases of ''Quatermass II'' and ''Quatermass and the Pit'', both published in 1960.<ref name="pixley38"/> All three of these releases were reprinted by Arrow Books in 1979 with new introductions by Kneale, to tie-in with the television transmission of the fourth and final serial.<ref name="pixley39"/>

Arrow Books also released a [[novelisation]] of the 1979 ''Quatermass'' serial, written by Kneale.<ref name="murray138">Murray, p. 138.</ref> This was written during production, and contained many additional scenes and extra background detail not included in the original scripts. Kneale offered many of these new scenes to the producers of the television version, but by this stage it was too late for them to be incorporated.<ref name="murray138"/>

In 1995, [[BBC radio]] producer Paul Quinn approached Kneale with the idea of making a new radio series based around Quatermass, and the resulting project was produced and aired as the five-part serial ''[[The Quatermass Memoirs]]'' on [[BBC Radio 3]] in the spring of 1996.<ref name="cdnotes">{{cite book|title=The Quatermass Memoirs - sleeve notes|first=Andrew|last=Pixley|publisher=[[BBC Worldwide]]|year=2006|location=[[London]]|isbn=1-84607-105-4}}</ref> The serial had three strands: a [[monologue]] from Kneale recounting the background to the creation and writing of the original 1950s serials; archive material from both the original productions and contemporary news broadcasts; and a dramatised strand set shortly before the 1979 serial, with Quatermass being visited in retreat in Scotland by a reporter eager to write his life story.<ref name="cdnotes"/> Of the actors who had previously played Quatermass, only Keir and Mills were still alive; Keir took the role, his final professional performance before his death the following year.<ref name="murray177">Murray, p. 177.</ref> ''The Quatermass Memoirs'' was repeated several times on [[digital radio]] station [[BBC7]] from 2003, and the serial was released on [[CD]] in 2006.<ref name="cdnotes"/>

A live [[theatre|theatrical]] production of ''Quatermass and the Pit'' was staged, with the permission of Kneale, outdoors in a [[quarry]] at the village of [[Cropwell Bishop]] in [[Nottinghamshire]] in August 1997. The adaptation was written by Peter Thornhill and mounted by Creation Productions, with David Longford starring as Quatermass.<ref name="pixley40"/>

All of the various film and surviving television productions featuring Quatermass have been released on [[DVD]].<ref name="bbcdvd"/><ref name="moviedvds">{{cite news|title=New videos|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/article865133.ece|first=Geoff|last=Brown|publisher=[[The Times]]|date=2003-04-23|accessdate=2007-05-08 | location=London}}</ref>

==Themes==
Nigel Kneale explained in a 1990s interview the background that had led him to formulate Quatermass and the other characters of the original serial in 1953. "I wanted to write some strong characters, but I didn't want them to be like those horrible people in those awful American science fiction films, chewing gum and stating the obvious. Not that I wanted to do something terribly 'British', but I didn't like all the flag-waving you got in those films. I tried to get real human interest in the stories, and some good humour."<ref name="hunter50">Hunter, p. 50.</ref>

Writing in 2005, the television history lecturer Dr Catherine Johnson felt that in the original three 1950s serials, Quatermass as a character represented the championing of science and rationality over the supernatural and the fantastic. "As a leading scientific innovator, Quatermass is invested with scientific and [[moral authority]]. Over the three serials, this authority is tested and undermined&nbsp;... Despite this, the narrative structure of all three serials works to reinforce the authority invested in Quatermass and in science. Although scientific enterprise is responsible for disastrous consequences in the first two ''Quatermass'' serials, it is only through science that the alien invasions are overcome&nbsp;... He is invested with the narrative authority to understand and ''explain'' the fantastic events depicted."<ref name="johnson29">Johnson, p. 29.</ref>

The writer and critic [[Kim Newman]] went further, explaining in a 2003 television documentary on Nigel Kneale's career that he believed Quatermass to be not only a representation of science but of humanity itself. Referring to the conclusion of ''The Quatermass Experiment'', he commented that: "It almost boils down to an editorial speech by Quatermass representing humanity, or the humane aspects of humanity. He talks to the monster, and so the monster is defeated by an intellectual argument or an emotional appeal."<ref name="tapes">{{cite episode|title=The Kneale Tapes|series=Timsehift|credits=Producer - Tom Ware; Executive Producer - Michael Poole|network=[[BBC Four]]|airdate=2003-10-15}}</ref> Like Kneale, he contrasted this to American science-fiction productions, where the alien adversary would be defeated by "it being blown up or electrocuted, or having the entire firepower of the army turned against it."<ref name="tapes"/> Hammer had altered their film version of the story so that the creature is in fact killed by being electrocuted.<ref name="kinsey32">Kinsey, p. 32.</ref>

In contrast to Newman's idea of Quatermass as the embodiment of humanity, writer and lecturer Peter Hutchings in his essay "We are the Martians" sees Quatermass as an isolated character. "In the 1950s Quatermass stories, Quatermass himself is someone who, while working to protect the nation, remains a curiously isolated figure, bereft of anything resembling a meaningful relationship. (In the 1979 ''Quatermass'', he has acquired a granddaughter; possibly connected with this is the fact that here he seems a much weaker figure who can only defeat the aliens through the sacrifice of the lives of both himself and his granddaughter)."<ref name="hunter39">Hunter, p. 39.</ref> Hutchings also compared this to American productions of the era: "The standard, if not clich<U+00E9>d, figures of the clean-cut square-jawed hero and his girl, which are present in some form or other in most US sf films of this period&nbsp;... are absent."<ref name="hunter39"/>

The 1994 ''Doctor Who'' novel ''[[Nightshade (Doctor Who)|Nightshade]]'' is about an actor who starred in a thinly disguised version of Quatermass,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/ebooks/nightshade/chapter1.shtml|title=Nightshade - Chapter One|first=Mark|last=Gatiss|authorlink=Mark Gatiss|publisher=[[bbc.co.uk]]|accessdate=2009-01-12}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> discovering that the events of the serials are becoming reality. The fictional Professor Nightshade was also mentioned in subsequent novels. Author [[Mark Gatiss]] described the ''Nightshade'' serial in his notes accompanying the e-book release as "a TV series that isn't quite ''Quatermass'' and isn't quite ''Doctor Who''", adding "I was utterly obsessed by Quatermass at that time."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/ebooks/nightshade/notes.shtml|title=Nightshade - Notes|first=Mark|last=Gatiss|authorlink=Mark Gatiss|publisher=[[bbc.co.uk]]|accessdate=2009-01-12}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

The 1997 ''Doctor Who'' novel ''[[The Dying Days]]'', set in its year of release, features in one chapter an elderly character introduced halfway through a sentence as "-ermass", and subsequently referred to as "Professor" and "Bernard" during his brief appearance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/ebooks/dyingdays/two/page16.shtml|title=The Dying Days - Chapter Two - Page 16|first=Lance|last=Parkin|authorlink=Lance Parkin|publisher=[[bbc.co.uk]]|accessdate=2007-05-08}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> Author [[Lance Parkin]] confirmed in his notes accompanying the later [[e-book]] release that this was a deliberate cameo from Quatermass, specifically the John Mills version from the final serial.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/ebooks/dyingdays/notes/page3.shtml|title=The Dying Days - Author Notes - Chapter Two|first=Lance|last=Parkin|authorlink=Lance Parkin|publisher=[[bbc.co.uk]]|accessdate=2007-05-08}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

The 2005 ''Doctor Who'' episode "[[The Christmas Invasion]]" featured the British Rocket Group, although the organisation was only identifiable by a logo not clearly seen on screen and never referred to in dialogue. It was, however, heavily referenced in a tie-in website for the episode created by the [[bbc.co.uk]] ''Doctor Who'' webteam.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Christmas Special: The Christmas Invasion|first=Andrew|last=Pixley|journal=[[Doctor Who Magazine]] &mdash; Series Two Companion|date=2006-11-06, cover date|pages= 12&ndash;21|issue=Special Edition 14}}</ref>

In the 2008 ''Doctor Who'' novel ''[[Beautiful Chaos]]'', the Doctor briefly mentions being invited to the Royal Planetary Society by "Bernard and Paula". In the 2009 television episode "[[Planet of the Dead]]", "Bernard" is used as the name for a unit of measurement, and it is explained that this is in reference to Quatermass - whether as a fictional or a real person is not stated.

===Other references===

==Parodies and homages==
In February 1959 the BBC radio comedy series ''[[The Goon Show]]'' broadcast a parody of ''Quatermass and the Pit'', entitled "The Scarlet Capsule". [[Harry Secombe]] played his regular character in ''The Goon Show'', [[Neddie Seagoon]], in turn playing "Professor Ned Cratermess, [[OBE]]."<ref name="pixley37">Pixley, p. 37.</ref> This was followed later in the same year by a spoof on another BBC radio comedy show, ''That Man Chester'', which launched a regular strand entitled "The Quite-a-Mess Three Saga", with [[Deryck Guyler]] as "Professor Quite-a-Mess".<ref name="pixley37"/> However, the "Quite-a-Mess" name and references were dropped after only three of the episodes under pressure from Kneale, who felt that a 13-week spoof would be to the detriment of the original character.<ref name="pixley38"/>

In the early 1970s, a British [[progressive rock]] group named both [[Quatermass (band)|themselves]] and [[Quatermass (album)|their first album]] "Quatermass".<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p20020|pure_url=yes}}|title=Quatermass|first=Andy|last=Kellman|publisher=[[Allmusic]]|accessdate=2007-05-08}}</ref>

[[Goa trance]] musicians Jason Gill & Simon Washington formed a group named Quatermass in 1995.

A television spoof appeared in a 1986 episode of the BBC [[sketch show]] ''[[The Two Ronnies]]'', which featured a sketch entitled "It Came From Outer Hendon", written by [[David Renwick]]. This spoof starred [[Ronnie Corbett]] as "Professor Martin Cratermouse".<ref name="pixley40"/>

In [[Joe Dante]]'s 1990 film ''[[Gremlins 2: The New Batch]]'', in a corridor of the Clamp Tower, one of the door nameplates is for "Dr. Quatermass".

The DVD release of the 2004 remake of ''[[Dawn of the Dead (2004 film)|Dawn of the Dead]]'' includes a bonus feature in the form of a simulated newscast covering the rise of [[zombie]]s across America. A doctor is interviewed about the zombies being dead people who have come back to life - his name being Dr. Quatermass.<ref>''Special Report'', a bonus feature on the DVD release of ''[[Dawn of the Dead (2004 film)|Dawn of the Dead]]'', 2004</ref>

===John Carpenter===
The [[film director]] [[John Carpenter]] wrote the screenplay for his 1987 film ''[[Prince of Darkness (film)|Prince of Darkness]]'' under the [[pseudonym]] "Martin Quatermass".<ref name="darkness">{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093777/fullcredits|title=Prince of Darkness (1987)|publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]|accessdate=2007-02-10}}</ref> Carpenter had previously worked with Nigel Kneale on the 1982 film ''[[Halloween III: Season of the Witch]]''.<ref name="murray159">Murray, p. 159.</ref>

Carpenter also later set the location for his 1994 film ''[[In the Mouth of Madness]]'' in the fictional [[New England]] town of [[Hobbs End]], a reference to ''Quatermass and the Pit''.
