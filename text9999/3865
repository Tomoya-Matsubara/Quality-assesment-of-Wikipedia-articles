Although Hrisi Avgi remains a party of minor electoral importance, it drew public attention in the 90s and early 2000.<ref name="ToVima">[http://tovima.dolnet.gr/print_article.php?e=B&f=14562&m=A44&aa=1 11/9/2005 article] from newspaper [[To Vima]].</ref><ref name="IosHist">[http://www.hri.org/E/1998/98-07-02.dir/keimena/greece/greece2.htm 2/07/1998 article] published in [[Eleftherotypia]].</ref>

Michaloliakos announced the disbandment of Hrisi Avgi in November 2005, due to clashes with [[Antifascism|anti-fascists]].<ref name="Ingr">[http://www.in.gr/news/article.asp?lngEntityID=667563&lngDtrID=244 01/12/05 article] by [http://www.in.gr www.in.gr]</ref> In 2005-2007 he (like most members of Hrisi Avgi) continued his political activity through [[Patriotic Alliance]].<ref name="ToVima"/>

In March 2007, Hrisi Avgi held its sixth congress in which was announced the continuation of their political and ideological activism.
