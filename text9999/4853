<!--Since his 1993 film, ''[[Crime Story]]'', Chan has consciously included more [[drama]]tic elements in his films. This was particularly the case in recent films such as ''[[New Police Story]]'' and ''[[The Myth (film)|The Myth]]''. ''Rob-B-Hood'' continues this trend, whilst maintaining his trademark comedic style, action and stuntwork.-->

[[Image:Rbh E.JPG|thumb|left|For the first time in a lead role, Jackie Chan plays a character who is sentenced to prison.]]
Jackie Chan contacted Benny Chan shortly after the release of ''New Police Story'' to discuss plans for a new action film. Chan stated that he did not want to play the typical nice guy role that has been the staple of [[Jackie Chan filmography|his previous films]]. Eventually, Benny Chan and scriptwriter Alan Yuen came up with a daring idea: Chan will play Thongs, a petty criminal who has fallen out with his family over his [[gambling problem|gambling habit]].<ref>{{cite web

''Rob-B-Hood'' features a collaboration between Chan and [[Yuen Biao]]. The pair, along with [[Sammo Hung]], were [[Peking Opera School]] classmates and co-starred in a number of action comedy films in the 1980s, including ''Project A'', ''[[Wheels on Meals]]'', and the ''[[Lucky Stars]]'' trilogy. Chan had originally intended to co-star with both Yuen and Hung, reuniting the trio for the first time since 1988's ''[[Dragons Forever]]''. However, Hung declined due to scheduling conflicts. Yuen Biao plays the role of Police Inspector Mok, assigned to investigate the baby's disappearance.

Benny Chan described the filming process as some of the darkest days of his career, explaining that the baby was a factor beyond his control, and could not work more than eight hours a day. Whenever a scene involving the baby was shot, the crew members had to be silent, communicating in [[sign language]]. Benny Chan stated it took time, patience, and money to guide the baby through each shot, and numerous retakes were required due to the baby's constant crying and napping. As a result, production went [[Cost overrun|over budget]].<ref name="BC"/> Special methods were sometimes used to coax the baby into cooperation. One scene required the baby to suckle Chan's [[nipple]]. The baby was initially hesitant, but relented after the crew brushed a large amount of [[honey]] onto the nipple.<ref>{{cite video

Several scenes required Chan to coordinate his stunts with the baby, including a car chase around the Sha Tin industrial area, in which he managed to snatch the baby away seconds before a car crashed into him; and a scene in Ocean Park in which he climbed on the underside of a [[roller coaster]] with the baby in hand.<ref name="BC"/><ref name="Film">{{cite video

==Plot==
[[Image:Rbh A.JPG|thumb|The Landlord sedates the baby while Octopus looks on.]]
The film begins showing Thongs and Octopus evading security guards in a hospital, having stolen money and cancer medication from the safe. Meanwhile, a newborn baby to the wealthy Lee family is snatched by Max, the mother's ex-boyfriend, prompting the security guards give chase, ignoring the burglars, and corner Max on an escalator. Following a violent struggle, Max and the baby fall over the side<U+2014>The baby is caught by Thongs, while Max plummets to his death. While the guards are distracted, Thongs and Octopus leave in the Landlord's [[minivan]].

A few months later, the Landlord finds his flat burgled, his life savings gone. He receives a phone call from his middleman Uncle Seven, offering him a job to kidnap baby Lee on behalf of a triad boss, who claims the baby is his grandson. Enticed by the HK$7 million reward, Thongs and Octopus accept the job without knowing its objectives, finding out only after the Landlord has fled the Lees' mansion with the baby. Disgusted by the idea of kidnapping a baby, Thongs threatens to return him, but relents after the Landlord tells him of his predicament. En route to their rendezvous point in [[Sai Kung]], the three encounter a police [[road block]] which the Landlord attempts to outrun, only to crash his vehicle down a hill. As the police close in on them, the stuck Landlord instructs Thongs and Octopus to leave with the baby. While in custody for [[reckless driving]], the Landlord learns of the baby's value through the news. He phones Thongs, instructing him not to hand the baby over to anyone prior to his release so he can jack up the price. Over the next few days, Thongs and Octopus take care of the baby, developing a strong bond with him. The two begin to regret their vices: Thongs resists the urge to gamble, while Octopus feels sorry for cheating on his wife. Meanwhile, both the triads and the police are after the baby. The triad boss, enraged by the non-delivery of his "grandson", sends his men to retrieve the baby from Thongs' flat. Confronted by both the triads and Police Inspector Mok, Thongs and Octopus go into hiding with the baby. 

Shortly after his release, the Landlord is brought to the triad boss, who increases his offer to HK$30 million for the baby. He finds Thongs and Octopus at the hospital, where the baby is being treated for fever. The Landlord informs the two of the triads' latest offer, but Thongs and Octopus are more concerned about the baby's welfare than the cash. However, the two agree to bring the baby to the triad boss' mansion, where the Landlord will meet them with the rest of the money. As the trio are about to leave, they hear the baby crying for them as a [[blood sample]] is taken from his arm. Thongs and Octopus experience a flashback of the days they spent with the baby. Overcome by their feelings, they fight their way into the triad boss' private amusement park to recover the baby while the Landlord leaves with the money. Thongs almost manages to escape with the baby, but is forced to surrender when the triads threaten to hurl Octopus to his death.

Thongs and Octopus are taken to the triad boss, who insists the baby is his grandson, only to be proven wrong by the [[blood test]]. Driven mad, the boss places the baby in a deep freeze room next to Max's corpse, prompting Thongs and Octopus fight for the baby. The two end up trapped in the room with two minions, but are saved when Inspector Mok arrives with the Landlord, who swiftly cracks the lock to the room. Thongs and Octopus run to the garage with the [[coma]]tose baby, where Thongs attempts to revive him with a makeshift [[defibrillator]] powered by a [[car battery]]. Despite his efforts, the baby does not come to and is driven off in an [[ambulance]], where his heart is found to be beating weakly. Imprisoned for kidnapping, Thongs, Octopus and the Landlord volunteer for a mock [[capital punishment]] demonstration during an open day, using the opportunity to apologise to their loved ones. After the demonstration, Inspector Mok informs the three that their sentences have been reduced. As a token of appreciation for saving the baby's life, Thongs, Octopus and the Landlord are offered jobs by the Lee family as a [[bodyguard]], [[chauffeur]] and head of security respectively.

==Reception==
[[Image:Project BB Japan.jpg|thumb|150px|Promotional poster of ''Project BB'' in Japan]]
''Rob-B-Hood'' was generally well received by critics. The film received praise at the Venice Film Festival for having a delicate balance between action and drama. Jay Weissberg of [[Variety (magazine)|Variety magazine]] described the film as "a mildly fun ride that banked on Jackie's tried-and-true comic charm in a standard baby kidnapping farce enlivened by just enough action sequences to keep hoary diaper scenes from soiling the playpen".<ref name = "Variety"/> Credit was given to the stunt choreography and the acting partnership of Jackie Chan and Louis Koo, although some reviewers were disappointed about the absence of Sammo Hung.<ref>{{cite web
