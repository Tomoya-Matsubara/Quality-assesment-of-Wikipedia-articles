"'''LoveStoned/I Think She Knows (Interlude)'''" (commonly referred to as only "'''LoveStoned'''") is a song by American [[singer-songwriter]] [[Justin Timberlake]] from his second studio album, ''[[FutureSex/LoveSounds]]'' (2006). It was released on June 14, 2007 by [[Jive Records]] as the fifth single from the album. The song was co-written and produced by Timberlake, [[Timbaland]], and [[Danja|Nate "Danja" Hills]].

In contrast to the album's theme about sexual innuendos with themes of love, "LoveStoned" contains sexually suggestive lyrics. Musically "LoveStoned" is an upbeat dance song, while the interlude of "I Think She Knows" has a more slower, quiet, guitar-driven sound.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C07E3D61431F932A2575AC0A9609C8B63|title=Critic's Choice: New CD's|last=Sanneh|first=Kalefa|date=2006-09-11|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2009-05-15}}</ref> Overall, the song also includes a [[string section]]. "LoveStoned/I Think She Knows" was well-received by music critics, who noted the track's general sound and lyrics.

The track entered the top ten on most charts, topping several of ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine's component charts, including reaching the number one spot on the [[Hot Dance Club Play]] and ''[[Hot Dance Airplay]]'' charts, respectively. The international chart performance of the single failed to match its domestic success, never reaching the top spot. After its release, "LoveStoned/I Think She Knows" was downloaded 39,000 times on [[iTunes]]. The song won [[Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording|Best Dance Recording]] at the [[50th Grammy Awards|2008 Grammy Awards]]. The single has been widely [[sampling (music)|sampled]], with different [[cover version|covers]] and [[audio mixing (recorded music)|sounds]].

==Reception==
The song received positive reception from critics. In the ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' review of the album, critic Chris Willman wrote: "Superior tracks, like 'LoveStoned' and 'What Comes Around', suggest a happy middle path, where Timberlake can equally embrace Timbaland's canny beats and his own vocal helium."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1532765,00.html|title=FutureSex/LoveSounds (2006)|last=Willman|first=Chris|date=2006-09-08|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=2009-05-14}}</ref> Tim Finney of [[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]] described the song as "brilliantly&nbsp;... tight, clipped disco funk" and went onto say that it "descends precipitously into the gorgeous melancholy of 'I Think That She Knows', all MOR-rock guitar churn and weightless strings, the same chorus ('She's got me love stoned...and I think that she knows') transformed from infatuation to the paranoid and elegiac admission of an addict".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11888-futuresexlovesounds/|title=Pitchfork: Justin Timberlake: FutureSex / LoveSounds|last=Finney|first=Tim|date=2006-09-13|publisher=[[Pitchfork Media]]|accessdate=2009-05-14}}</ref> Lauren Murphy of [[entertainment.ie|Entertainment.ie]] noted "LoveStoned" as excellent and "a sexy, layered affair with inspired violin intervals, and the consecutive interlude is a classy sliver of deftly-produced pop".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.ie/album-review/Justin-Timberlake---FutureSex/LoveSounds/4678.htm|title=Justin Timberlake&nbsp;<U+2014> FutureSex/LoveSounds|last=Murphy|first=Lauren|date=2006-09-19|publisher=[[entertainment.ie]]|accessdate=2009-05-14}}</ref> Lucy Davies of the [[BBC]] wrote: "'Lovestoned' is a great track, with chopping violins, beatboxing, and bongos.
