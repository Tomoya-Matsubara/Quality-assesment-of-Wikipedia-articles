'''Catherine Astrid Salome Freeman''' (born [[16 February]] [[1973]]) is an [[Australia]]n [[athletics (track and field)|athlete]] who is particularly associated with the 400 m race.  As an [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal Australian]], she is regarded as a role model for her people, and by many in the non-Aboriginal community as a symbol of national [[Aboriginal reconciliation|reconciliation]] between [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] and non-indigenous Australians.

She was born in [[Mackay, Queensland|Mackay]], [[Queensland]].  At the [[1994 Commonwealth Games]] in [[Victoria, British Columbia]], [[Canada]], she created a great deal of controversy by waving the [[Aboriginal flag]] as well as the [[Australian flag]] during her victory lap of the arena.  Normally, only the [[national flag]] is so waved. There was no such controversy when she did the same after winning her gold medal at the Sydney 2000 Olympics, even though the use of non-national flags at the Olympics is officially forbidden.

Freeman won two World Championships in the 400 m event, in [[Athens]] ([[1997]]) and [[Seville]] ([[1999]]). At the [[1996]] [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]] Olympics, she won the silver medal behind [[Marie-Jos<U+00E9> Perec]] of [[France]]. 

On [[25 September]] [[2000]] Cathy Freeman won the 400 m [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] title in front of her home crowd during the [[2000 Summer Olympics|Sydney 2000 Olympics]]. In her own words, she "ran her little black butt off". The medal was regarded as Australia's 100th gold medal.  Earlier, she had lit the [[Olympic Flame]] in the Games' Opening Ceremony. This made her the only person to light the Olympic flame and go on to win a gold medal at the same games.

Freeman had a long-term romantic relationship with [[Nick Bideau]], her manager, that ended in acrimony and legal wranglings over Freeman's endorsement earnings.<ref>[http://smh.com.au/news/commentary/mottrams-manipulator/2006/03/21/1142703363720.html Bideau's methods are make or break] - by [[Raelene Boyle]] - publisher: [[Sydney Morning Herald|SMH]] ([[22 March]] [[2006]])</ref>

Freeman married Sandy Bodecker, a [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] executive, in 1999.  After her success in Sydney she took  an extended break from the track to nurse Bodecker through a bout of [[cancer]]. She announced their separation in February 2003.

Returning to running in 2003, Freeman clearly struggled for form and motivation after losses to upcoming Australian runner [[Jana Pittman]], and a fifth placing in an athletics meet in May where she was thoroughly trounced by [[Ana Guevara]] of [[Mexico]], the fastest 400 m runner at that time.  

On [[15 July]] [[2003]] Freeman announced her retirement from competitive running.

On [[15 March]] [[2006]], Cathy Freeman was one of the final runners in the [[Queen's Baton Relay]], bringing the baton into the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|MCG]] at the Opening Ceremony of the [[2006 Commonwealth Games]] in [[Melbourne]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Australia]].
