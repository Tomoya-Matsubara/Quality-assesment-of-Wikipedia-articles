The [[Town Hall]] is {{convert|75|mi|km|0}} north of [[London]] at [[Charing Cross]]. The city stands athwart the [[River Nene]], which flows into the [[North Sea]] approximately 30 miles (48&nbsp;km) to the north-east, and the [[East Coast Main Line]] railway. 

The local topography is flat and low-lying, and in some places lies below sea level. The area known as [[the Fens]] falls to the east of Peterborough. The City of Peterborough includes the outlying settlement at [[RAF Wittering]], and as a unitary authority it borders [[Northamptonshire]] and [[Rutland]] to the west, [[Lincolnshire]] to the north, and Cambridgeshire to the south and east.

Human settlement in the area dates back to before the [[Bronze Age]], as can be seen at the [[Flag Fen]] archaeological site to the east of the current city centre. This site also shows evidence of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] occupation. The [[History of Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon]] period saw the establishment of a [[monastery]], then known as [[Medeshamstede]], which later became [[Peterborough Cathedral]]. The population grew rapidly following the arrival of the railways in the nineteenth century, and Peterborough became an industrial centre, particularly noted for its brick manufacture. 

Following the [[Second World War]], growth was limited until designation as a [[New towns in the United Kingdom|New Town]] in the 1960s. The population is once again undergoing rapid expansion and a <U+00A3>1 billion regeneration of the city centre and immediately surrounding area is under way. In common with much of the [[United Kingdom]], industrial employment has fallen, with new jobs tending to be in financial services and distribution.

==History==
===Early history===
Present-day Peterborough is the latest in a series of settlements which have at one time or other benefited from its situation, where the Nene leaves permanently drained land for the Fens. Remains of Bronze Age settlement and what is thought to be religious activity can be seen at the Flag Fen archaeological site to the east of the city centre. The Romans established a fortified garrison town at [[Durobrivae (Water Newton)|Durobrivae]] on [[Ermine Street]], some five miles (8&nbsp;km) to the west of the present city, around the middle of the first century AD. Durobrivae's earliest appearance among surviving records is in the [[Antonine Itinerary]] of the late second century.<ref>Parthey, Gustav and Pinder, Moritz (eds.) ''Itinerarivm Antonini Avgvsti et Hierosolymitanum: ex libris manu scriptis'' [http://www.roman-britain.org/geography/itinerary.htm Iter Britanniarvm] (Iter V: Item a Londinio Luguvalio ad vallum mpm clvi ''sic'') Friederich Nicolaus, Berlin, 1848. See also Reynolds, Thomas ''Iter Britanniarum or that part of the itinerary of Antoninus which relates to Britain with a new comment'' J. Burges, Cambridge, 1799.</ref> There was also a large first-century [[castra|Roman fort]] at [[Longthorpe, Peterborough|Longthorpe]], designed to house half a [[Roman legion|legion]], or about 3,000 soldiers;<ref>[http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/B/bigromandig/camesaw/3_495a.jsp They came, they saw] Top 30 Roman sites (6), ''Channel 4 Television'' (retrieved 20 July 2008).</ref> it may have been established as early as around AD&nbsp;44&ndash;48.<ref>[http://www.pastscape.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=364099 National Monuments Record] Monument No. 364099, [[Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission for England]] (retrieved 20 July 2008).</ref> Peterborough was an important area of ceramic production in the Roman period, providing Nene Valley Ware that was traded as far away as Cornwall and the [[Antonine Wall]].

Peterborough is shown by its original name [[Medeshamstede]] to have possibly been an [[Angles|Anglian]] settlement before AD&nbsp;655, when [[Sexwulf|Saxwulf]] founded a monastery on land granted to him for that purpose by [[Peada of Mercia|Peada]] of [[Mercia]], who was briefly ruler of the [[Middle Angles]]. The [[Peterborough Chronicle]], which contains unique information about the [[history of England]] after the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman Conquest]], was composed here in the twelfth century by monks of the [[abbey]].<ref>[[Bodleian Library|Bodleian]], MS. Laud 636 (E), see Ingram, James Henry (trans.) ''The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' J. M. Dent & Sons, London, 1823 ([http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/657 facsimile of the 1847 Everyman's Library ed. with additional readings from the translation of John Allen Giles] from [[Project Gutenberg]], retrieved 19 September 2007). {{OCLC|645704}}.

Dent & Sons, London, 1972 & 1975. {{OCLC|63489126}}. For the Peterborough Chronicle's unique information, see also Clark, Cecily (ed.) ''The Peterborough Chronicle 1070&ndash;1154'' (pp.xxi-xxx) Oxford University Press, 1958.</ref> This is the only known prose history in English between the conquest and the later fourteenth century.<ref>[[J. A. W. Bennett|Bennett, Jack Arthur Walter]] ''Middle English Literature'' (ed. and completed by Douglas Gray), Oxford University Press, 1986.</ref> The town's name changed to ''Burgh'' from the late tenth century, possibly after Abbot Kenulf had built a [[defensive wall]] around the abbey, and eventually developed into the form Peterborough; the town does not appear to have been a [[borough]] until the twelfth century.<ref>Originating in a new name for the abbey at Medeshamstede, and not the town, the name ''Burh'' was adopted for the abbey in the late tenth century, see Garmonsway (p. 117), also Mellows, William Thomas (ed.) ''The Chronicle of Hugh Candidus a Monk of Peterborough'' (pp.38 & 480) Oxford University Press, 1949, {{OCLC|314897451}}; the addition of ''Peter'', the name of the abbey's principal titular saint, parallels development of eg. the name [[Bury St. Edmunds Abbey|Bury St. Edmunds]] and will have served to distinguish between the two places. Exemplified in medieval records in the [[Medieval Latin|Latinised]] form ''Burgus Sancti Petri'', this gave rise to the modern name Peterborough.</ref> The form ''Gildenburgh'' is also found, though only in local, twelfth century histories of the abbey, namely the Peterborough version of the [[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]] and a history of the abbey by the monk Hugh Candidus.<ref>Garmonsway (pp.183 & 198-99); Mellows, 1949 (p.66). As a modern local historian has put it, this was "a rhetorical term," used in these twelfth-century local histories "to contrast the riches of the late [Anglo-Saxon] monastery with the decrease in income caused by later impositions and the despoliation of the monastic treasure by Hereward," see Tebbs, Herbert F. ''Peterborough: A History'' (p.23) The Oleander Press, Cambridge, 1979.</ref> The burgesses received their first charter from "Abbot Robert" &mdash; probably Robert of Sutton (1262&ndash;1273).<ref name=chisholm>[[Hugh Chisholm|Chisholm, Hugh]] (ed.)

When [[English civil war|civil war]] broke out, Peterborough was divided between supporters of King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] (known as [[Cavalier]]s) and supporters of the [[Long Parliament]] (known as [[Roundhead]]s). The city lay on the border of the [[Eastern Association]] of counties which sided with Parliament, and the war reached Peterborough in 1643 when soldiers arrived in the city to attack Royalist strongholds at [[Stamford, Lincolnshire|Stamford]] and [[Crowland]]. The Royalist forces were defeated within a few weeks and retreated to [[Burghley House]], where they were captured and sent to [[Cambridge]].<ref>Davies, Elizabeth et al.

Historically the [[Dean (religion)|dean]] and [[Chapter (religion)|chapter]], who succeeded the [[abbot]] as [[lords of the manor]], appointed a high [[bailiff]], and the [[constables]] and other borough officers were elected at their [[court leet]]; but the [[municipal borough]] was [[Boroughs incorporated in England and Wales 1835 - 1882|incorporated]] in 1874 under the government of a [[mayor]], six [[aldermen]] and eighteen [[councillors]].<ref>Under the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]] (5 & 6 Wm. IV c.76), Charter of Incorporation dated 17 March 1874.</ref> Among the privileges claimed by the abbot as early as the thirteenth century was that of having a prison for felons taken in the [[Soke of Peterborough|Soke]]. In 1576 Bishop [[Edmund Scambler]] sold the [[Lord Paramount|lordship]] of the hundred of ''Nassaburgh'', which was coextensive with the Soke, to Queen [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]], who gave it to [[Lord Burghley]], and from that time until the nineteenth century he and his descendants, the Earls and [[Marquess of Exeter|Marquesses of Exeter]], had a separate gaol for prisoners arrested in the Soke.<ref name=chisholm/> The abbot formerly held four [[fairs]], of which two, St. Peter's Fair, granted in 1189 and later held on the second Tuesday and Wednesday in July, and the Brigge Fair, granted in 1439 and later held on the first Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday in October, were purchased by the [[municipal corporation|corporation]] from the [[Ecclesiastical Commissioners]] in 1876. The Bridge Fair, as it is now known, granted to the abbey by King [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]], survives.<ref>"At the bridge of Peterborough by the River Nene, as well in the county of Huntingdon as in the county of Northampton, on all sides of the bridge."</ref> Prayers for the opening of the fair were once said at the morning service in the cathedral, followed by a civic proclamation and a sausage lunch at the Town Hall which still takes place. The Mayor traditionally leads a procession from the Town Hall to the fair where the proclamation is read, asking all persons to "behave soberly and civilly, and to pay their just dues and demands according to the laws of the realm and the rights of the City of Peterborough."<ref>Tebbs (p.125).</ref>

===Modern history===
Railway lines began operating locally during the 1840s, but it was the 1850 opening of the [[Great Northern Railway (Great Britain)|Great Northern Railway's]] main line from [[London]] to [[York]] that transformed Peterborough from a market town to an industrial centre. [[Brownlow Cecil, 2nd Marquess of Exeter|Lord Exeter]] had opposed the railway passing through [[Stamford, Lincolnshire|Stamford]], so Peterborough, situated between two main terminals at London and [[Doncaster]], increasingly developed as a regional hub.<ref>Brooks, John [http://www.towns.org.uk/market-towns-projects/Market-Towns-Food-and-Tourism-Guides~3.pdf A Flavour of the Welland] (p.12) The Welland Partnership and Jarrold Publishing, Norwich, 2004.</ref>
[[Image:Front of Burghley House 2009.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Burghley House (1555&ndash;1587), seat of the Marquess of Exeter, hereditary Lord Paramount of Peterborough.]] 
Coupled with vast local clay deposits, the railway enabled large-scale brick-making and distribution to take place. The area was the UK's leading producer of bricks for much of the twentieth century. Brick-making had been a small seasonal craft since the early nineteenth century, but during the 1890s successful experiments at [[Fletton, Peterborough|Fletton]] using the harder clays from a lower level had resulted in a much more efficient process.<ref>Davies (pp.23-24).</ref> The dominance of London Brick in the market during this period gave rise to some of the country's most well-known landmarks, all built using the ubiquitous Fletton.<ref>[http://www.hanson.co.uk/samples/pdfs/Brick%20and%20cladding/London%20brick%20130%20years%20of%20history.pdf London Brick: 130 Years of History 1877&ndash;2007] Hanson Building Products, 2007.</ref> [[Perkins Engines]] was established in Peterborough in 1932 by [[Frank Perkins]], creator of the Perkins diesel engine.

Designated a [[New towns in the United Kingdom|New Town]] in 1967, [[Peterborough Development Corporation]] was formed in partnership with the city and county councils to house London's [[London overspill|overspill]] population in new  [[Township (England)|townships]] sited around the existing urban area.<ref>Under the New Towns Act 1965 (1965 cap.59) cf.

The last of these was never built, but a fourth, called [[Hampton, Peterborough|Hampton]], is now taking shape south of the city. It was decided that the city should have a major indoor shopping centre at its heart. Planning permission was received in late summer 1976 and [[Queensgate shopping centre|Queensgate]], containing over 90 stores and including parking for 2,300 cars, was opened by Queen [[Beatrix of the Netherlands]] in 1982. 34 miles (55&nbsp;km) of urban roads were planned and a network of high-speed roads, known as [[Road transport in Peterborough|parkways]], was constructed.<ref>Hancock, Tom ''Greater Peterborough Master Plan'' Peterborough Development Corporation, 1971.</ref> 

Peterborough's population grew by 45.4% between 1971 and 1991. New service-sector companies like [[Thomas Cook]] and Pearl Assurance were attracted to the city, ending the dominance of the manufacturing industry as employers. An [[urban regeneration company]] named [[Opportunity Peterborough]], under the chairmanship of Lord Mawhinney, was set up by the [[Office of the Deputy Prime Minister]] in 2005 to oversee Peterborough's future development.<ref>[http://www.peterboroughtoday.co.uk/news/EXPANSION-A-billion-reasons-to.959657.jp "Expansion: A billion reasons to be cheerful"], ''Peterborough Evening Telegraph'', 2 March 2005.</ref> Between 2006 and 2012 a <U+00A3>1 billion redevelopment of the city centre and surrounding areas is planned.

Proposals are already progressing for the north of Westgate, the south bank and the station quarter, where [[Network Rail]] is preparing a major mixed use development.<ref name=plan>[http://www.gpp-peterborough.org.uk/regions/documents/ThePlanforPeterboroughCityCentreFebruary2005.pdf The Plan for Peterborough City Centre], Peterborough City Council, East of England Development Agency and [[English Partnerships]], February 2005.</ref> Whilst recognising that the reconfiguration of the relationship between the city and station was critical, [[English Heritage]] found the current plans for Westgate unconvincing and felt more thought should be given to the vitality of the historic core.<ref>[http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/upload/pdf/UrbanPanelReviewPaperforPeterboroughMarch2006.pdf Urban Panel Review Paper for Peterborough], [[Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission for England]] and [[Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment]], 16 March 2006.</ref>

==Administration==
===Politics===
The city formed a [[parliamentary borough]] returning two [[Member of Parliament|members]] from 1541, with the rest of the Soke being part of [[Northamptonshire]] parliamentary county. The [[Great Reform Act]] did not affect the borough, although the remaining, rural portion of the Soke was transferred to the northern division of Northamptonshire.<ref>Formally the Representation of the People Act 1832 (2 & 3 Will. IV c.45).</ref> In 1885 the borough's representation was reduced to one member,<ref>Under the [[Redistribution of Seats Act 1885]] (48 & 49 Vict. c.23).</ref> and in 1918 the boundaries were adjusted to include the whole Soke.<ref>Youngs, Frederic A.

Mawhinney, who had previously served as Member of Parliament for Peterborough from 1979, was created [[life peer|Baron]] Mawhinney of Peterborough in the county of Cambridgeshire later that year. Peterborough and North West Cambridgeshire are included in the [[East of England (European Parliament constituency)|East of England]] constituency for [[elections]] to the [[European Parliament]]. It currently elects seven [[Member of the European Parliament|members]] using the [[d'Hondt method]] of [[party-list proportional representation|party-list]] [[proportional representation]].

===Local government===
[[Image:PB TownHall.jpg|thumb|right|220px|The Town Hall, Peterborough (1930&ndash;1933).]]
From 1889 the ancient [[Soke of Peterborough]] formed an [[administrative counties of England|administrative county]] in its own right with boundaries similar, although not identical, to the current unitary authority.<ref>Under the [[Local Government Act 1888]] (51 & 52 Vict. c.41).</ref> The area however remained geographically part of [[Northamptonshire]] until 1965, when the Soke of Peterborough was merged with [[Huntingdonshire]] to form the county of [[Huntingdon and Peterborough]].<ref>The Huntingdon and Peterborough Order 1964 (SI 1964/367), see [[Local Government Commission for England (1958&ndash;1967)]], ''Report and Proposals for the East Midlands General Review Area (Report No.3)'', 31 July 1961 and ''Report and Proposals for the Lincolnshire and East Anglia General Review Area (Report No.9)'', 7 May 1965.</ref> Following a review of [[Local government in the United Kingdom|local government]] in 1974, Huntingdon and Peterborough was abolished and the current [[districts of England|district]] created by the merger of the Municipal Borough of Peterborough with [[Peterborough Rural District|Peterborough]] [[Rural District]], [[Barnack Rural District]], [[Thorney Rural District]], [[Old Fletton Urban District|Old Fletton]] [[Urban District]] and part of the [[Norman Cross Rural District]], which had each existed since 1894.<ref>Under the [[Local Government Act 1894]] (56 & 57 Vict. c.73).</ref> This became part of the [[metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties of England|non-metropolitan county]] of [[Cambridgeshire]].<ref>Under the [[Local Government Act 1972]] (1972 cap.70), see [http://www.wikilivres.info/wiki/index.php/The_English_Non-metropolitan_Districts_(Definition)_Order_1972 The English Non-Metropolitan Districts (Definition) Order 1972] (SI 1972/2039) Part 5: County of Cambridgeshire.</ref> [[Letters patent]] were granted which continued the style of the [[city status in the United Kingdom|city]] over the greater area.<ref>Issued under the [[Great Seal of the Realm]] dated 25 June 1974, see the {{LondonGazette|issue=46334|startpage=7419|date=28 June 1974}}</ref> In 1998 the city became autonomous of Cambridgeshire [[county council]] as a [[unitary authority]], but it continues to form part of that [[counties of England|county]] for [[ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial]] purposes.<ref>[http://www.hmso.gov.uk/si/si1996/Uksi_19961878_en_1.htm The Cambridgeshire (City of Peterborough) (Structural, Boundary and Electoral Changes) Order 1996] (SI 1996/1878), see [[Local Government Commission for England (1992)]], ''Final Recommendations for the Future Local Government of Cambridgeshire'', October 1994 and ''Final Recommendations on the Future Local Government of Basildon & Thurrock, Blackburn & Blackpool, Broxtowe, Gedling & Rushcliffe, Dartford & Gravesham, Gillingham & Rochester upon Medway, Exeter, Gloucester, Halton & Warrington, Huntingdonshire & Peterborough, Northampton, Norwich, Spelthorne and the Wrekin'', December 1995.</ref> The leader and cabinet model of decision-making, first adopted by the [[city council]] in 2001, is similar to [[Her Majesty's Government|national government]].<ref>Under the [[Local Government Act 2000]] (2000 cap.22), see [http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/localgovernment/pdf/157437 Modular constitutions for English local authorities] [[Department for Environment, Transport and the Regions]], February 2001.</ref>

===Health service===
NHS Peterborough, the public-facing name of Peterborough [[Primary Care Trust]], guides primary care services (general practitioners, dentists, opticians and pharmacists) in the city, directly provides adult social care and services in the community such as [[Health visitor|health visiting]] and [[physiotherapy]] and also funds hospital care and other specialist treatments. Peterborough and Stamford Hospitals [[NHS Foundation Trust]] is one of the country's top performing acute trusts and, in 2004, became one of the first ten [[National Health Service (England)|English NHS]] foundation trusts.<ref>[http://www.healthcarecommission.org.uk/_db/_documents/NHS_Performance_Ratings_2005-2006.pdf The annual health check: assessing and rating the NHS] (pp.22, 34 & 69) [[Healthcare Commission|Commission for Healthcare Audit and Inspection]], October 2006.</ref> A <U+00A3>300 million health investment plan will see the transfer of the city's two hospitals to a single site by building a modern, flexible facility more suited to modern healthcare.

===Public utilities===
The council's budget for the financial year 2009/10 is <U+00A3>247.9 million.<ref>[http://www.peterborough.gov.uk/PDF/Council-tax-summary-200910-A-Z-Final.pdf Council Tax Summary and A&ndash;Z Guide] Peterborough City Council, 1 April 2009.</ref> The main source of non-school funding is the formula grant, which is paid by government to local authorities based on the services they provide. The remainder, to which the [[police authority|police]] and [[fire authority|fire]] authorities  (and parish council where this exists) set a precept, is raised from [[council tax]] and [[Business rates in England and Wales|business rates]]. Mains water and sewerage services are provided by [[Anglian Water]], a former [[Public ownership|nationalised industry]] and [[natural monopoly]], [[Privatisation|privatised]] in 1989 and regulated by [[OFWAT]]. 

Following deregulation, the consumer has a choice of energy supplier. [[Electricity]] was formerly provided by [[Eastern Electricity]], which was privatised in 1990. In 2002 the [[Electricity retailing|supply business]] was sold to [[Powergen]] and the [[Electricity distribution|distribution rights]] sold to [[EDF Energy]]. [[Natural gas]] was (and still is) supplied by [[Centrica plc#British Gas|British Gas]], which was privatised in 1986. Distribution and, as with electricity, [[Electricity transmission|transmission]], is the responsibility of the [[National Grid plc|National Grid]], having been demerged as Transco in 1997. These industries are regulated by [[OFGEM]]. [[Peterborough Power Station]] is a 360&nbsp;MWe gas-fired plant in [[Fengate, Peterborough|Fengate]] operated by [[Centrica]] Energy.

[[British Telecommunications]], privatised in 1984, provides fixed [[Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line|ADSL]] enabled (8&nbsp;Mbit/s) telephone lines. The [[subscriber trunk dialling]] code for Peterborough is [[all figure dialling|01733]], deriving from 73 for PE. [[Local loop unbundling]], giving other [[internet service provider]]s direct access, is completed at four out of 12 [[telephone exchanges|exchanges]]. The city is cabled by [[Virgin Media]].<ref>[http://www.samknows.com/broadband/countydetail.php?county=132 Broadband availability details for Peterborough] Samknows (retrieved 28 August 2007).</ref> These businesses are regulated by [[OFCOM]].

==Economy==
===Regeneration===
Peterborough is currently experiencing an economic boom compared to the rest of the country, believed in part to be due to the regeneration plan running to 2012. In 2005 economic growth was on average 5.5%, whilst in Peterborough it was 6.9%, the highest in the UK.<ref>[http://www.gpp-peterborough.org.uk/webpages/documents/GPPStrategyA406finalmay5.pdf Peterborough's Community Strategy] Greater Peterborough Partnership, Progress Report Summary 2006.</ref>

Recent figures, plotting growth from 1995 to 2004, reveal that Peterborough has become the most successful economy among unitary authorities in the East of England. The chart also reveals that the city's economy is growing faster than the East of England average and any other economy in the region.<ref>Hastings, David and Swadkin, Claire [http://www.statistics.gov.uk/elmr/02_07/downloads/ELMR02_07REI.pdf Regional economic indicators with a focus on the differences in regional economic performance] Economic and Labour Market Review, vol.1 no.2 (pp.52-64) February 2007.</ref> Peterborough leads the UK<U+2019>s business population growth, with a 3.78% increase between April and September 2006, according to [[Royal Mail]]'s Business Barometer.<ref>[http://www.news.royalmailgroup.com/news/articlec.asp?id=1880&brand=royal_mail "Peterborough leads UK<U+2019>s business population growth, according to Royal Mail<U+2019>s Business Barometer"], [[Royal Mail]] (press release), 19 January 2007.</ref> It has a strong economy in the environmental goods and services sector and has the largest cluster of environmental businesses in the UK.<ref>[http://www.encluster.org Peterborough Environment Cluster] The UK Centre for Economic and Environmental Development (retrieved 20 December 2007).</ref>

===Employment===
According to the [[United Kingdom Census 2001|2001 census]], the workplace population of 90,656 is divided into 60,118 people who live in Peterborough and 30,358 people who commute in. A further 13,161 residents commute out of the city to work.<ref>[http://www.eastofenglandobservatory.org.uk/WebDocuments/Public/approved/user_9/Peterborough%20UA%20Profile.pdf Commuting Profile for Peterborough] East of England Regional Assembly, 11 April 2005.</ref> Earnings in Peterborough are lower than average.

With traditionally low levels of unemployment, Peterborough is a popular destination for workers and has seen significant growth through migration since the post-war period. The leader of the council said he believed Peterborough had taken up to 80% of the 65,000 people who had arrived in [[East Anglia]] from the [[Baltic states]].<ref>[http://www.peterboroughtoday.co.uk/template/ViewArticle.aspx?SectionID=845&ArticleID=1714979 "Limit plea: Fears over immigrants"], ''Peterborough Evening Telegraph'', 23 August 2006.</ref> To help cope with this influx the council has put forward plans to construct an average of 1,300 homes each year until 2021.<ref>[http://www.peterborough.gov.uk/page-230 Housing Strategy Statement] Peterborough City Council, July 2004.</ref> Demand for short term employees remains high and the market supports up to 20 high street recruitment agencies at any given time.

==Transport==
[[Peterborough railway station|Peterborough]] is a major stop on the East Coast Main Line, 45&ndash;50 minutes' journey time from central London, with high-speed intercity services from [[London King's Cross|King's Cross]] to [[Edinburgh Waverley railway station|Edinburgh Waverley]] operated by the [[East Coast (train operating company)|East Coast Main Line Company]] at around a 20-minute frequency, and slower commuter services terminating at Peterborough operated by [[First Capital Connect]]. It is a major railway junction where a number of cross-country routes converge. [[East Midlands Trains]] operate the [[Peterborough to Lincoln Line]], with through services to Doncaster and a route from [[Liverpool Lime Street railway station|Liverpool Lime Street]] to [[Norwich]] or Cambridge via the main line north of Peterborough; [[CrossCountry]] operate the [[Birmingham to Peterborough Line]] and with [[National Express East Anglia]], the [[Ely to Peterborough Line]], with through services to Cambridge and [[Stansted Airport]] operated by the former and to [[Ipswich]] and [[London Liverpool Street]] by the latter.<ref>[http://nationalrail.co.uk/stations/PBO.html "Station Facilities for Peterborough"], [[National Rail]] Enquiries, 28 November 2006.</ref> Peterborough has a [[Peterborough Business Airport|business airport]] with a paved runway at [[Holme, Cambridgeshire|Holme]] and a [[Peterborough/Sibson Airport|recreational airfield]] hosting a parachute school at [[Stibbington|Sibson]].

It was built in 1847 by [[Lewis Cubitt]], who was more famous for his bridges in Australia, India and South America. Apart from some minor repairs in 1910 (the steel bands and cross braces around the fluted legs) the bridge remains as he built it. Now a listed structure, it is the oldest surviving cast-iron railway bridge in the UK.<ref>Labrum, Edward A.

The A1/A1(M) broadly follows the path of the historic [[Great North Road (United Kingdom)|Great North Road]] from [[St Paul's Cathedral]] in the heart of London, through Peterborough (Junction 17), continuing north a further 335 miles (539&nbsp;km) to central [[Edinburgh]]. In 1899 the [[British Electric Traction|British Electric Traction Company]] sought permission for a [[tram]]way joining the northern suburbs with the city centre. The system, which operated under the name Peterborough Electric Traction Company, opened in 1903 and was abandoned in favour of motor buses in 1930, when the company was merged into the [[Eastern Counties Omnibus Company]].<ref>Brandon and Knight (pp.47-49).</ref> Today, bus services in the city are operated by several companies including the [[Stagecoach Group]] ([[Stagecoach Cambridgeshire|Cambus and Viscount]]) and [[Delaine Buses]]. Despite its large-scale growth, Peterborough has the fastest peak and off-peak travel times for a city of its size in the UK, due to the construction of the parkways. The [[Local Transport Plan]] anticipates expenditure totalling around <U+00A3>180 million for the period up to 2010 on major road schemes to accommodate development.<ref>[http://www.peterborough.gov.uk/page-4536 The Second Local Transport Plan] Peterborough City Council, March 2006.</ref> 

The Peterborough Millennium [[Green Wheel]] is a 50-mile (80&nbsp;km) network of cycleways, footpaths and bridleways which provide safe, continuous routes around the city with radiating spokes connecting to the city centre. The project has also created a sculpture trail, which provides functional, landscape artworks along the Green Wheel route and a Living Landmarks project involving the local community in the creation of local landscape features such as mini woodlands, ponds and hedgerows.<ref>[http://lifeandhealth.guardian.co.uk/guides/cycling/story/0,,2022726,00.html "Cycle Guide: The Green Wheel"], ''The Guardian'', London, 3 March 2007.</ref> Another long-distance footpath, the [[Hereward Way]], runs from [[Oakham]] in [[Rutland]], through Peterborough, to [[East Harling]] in [[Norfolk]].

==Demographics==
===Ethnicity===
[[Image:Pbguildhall.jpg|thumb|right|220px|The Guildhall or [[Market Cross|Butter Cross]] (1669&ndash;1671), Cathedral Square, Peterborough.]]
Peterborough is home to one of the largest concentrations of [[Italian diaspora|Italian]] immigrants in the UK. This is mainly as a result of [[workforce|labour]] recruitment in the 1950s by the [[London Brick Company]] in the southern [[Italy|Italian]] regions of [[Apulia|Puglia]] and [[Campania]]. By 1960 approximately 3,000 Italian men were employed by London Brick, mostly at the [[Fletton, Peterborough|Fletton]] works.<ref>Colpi, Terry ''The Italian Factor: The Italian Community in Great Britain'' (p.149) Mainstream Publishing, Edinburgh, 1991.</ref> In 1962 the [[Missionaries of St. Charles Borromeo|Scalabrini Fathers]], who first arrived in 1956, purchased an old school and converted it into a church named after the [[patron saint]] of workers [[Saint Joseph|San Giuseppe]]. By 1991 over 3,000 [[baptism|christenings]] of [[Italian Briton|second-generation]] [[Italian people|Italians]] had been carried out there.<ref>Colpi (p.235).</ref> The population of Peterborough has grown much faster than the national average over the last few years, mainly as a result of immigration. In the late twentieth century the main source of immigration has been from [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries such as [[India]] and [[Pakistan]]. A more recent issue is that an unknown number of eastern Europeans from [[accession states]] have moved to Peterborough since 2004. This may mean that the population figures, based on the [[United Kingdom Census 2001|2001 census]], are an underestimate.<ref>[http://www.cambridgeshire.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/E0DEA099-0B7A-42A2-A459-055AB91FA9A8/0/PeterboroughProfile.pdf 2001 Census Profile of Peterborough] Cambridgeshire County Council, June 2003.</ref> The [[East of England Regional Assembly]] estimate that 16,000 eastern Europeans are now living in the city, one in ten of the population.<ref>Reid, Sue [http://www.mailonsunday.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=402024&in_page_id=1770 "The town the Poles took over"], ''The Mail on Sunday'', London, 24 August 2006.</ref> Modern Peterborough is a rapidly developing city and one that continues to change. The change has not been without problems however. In May 2004 groups of Pakistani residents clashed with [[Demographics of Afghanistan|Afghan]] and [[Iraq]]i [[asylum seekers]]. In the "running street battles," houses and cars were set alight and windows were smashed. Some people were hospitalised. The fighting occurred in the multicultural [[Millfield, Peterborough|Millfield]] area of the city.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/cambridgeshire/3731735.stm "Patrols to quell violent clashes"], ''BBC News Online'', 20 May 2004.</ref> In July of that year, a festival set up by the Indian community to celebrate the city's diversity turned violent. Pakistanis and Iraqis clashed over the weekend, leaving a man in hospital and large gangs fighting.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/cambridgeshire/3926423.stm "Ethnic groups clash at festival"], ''BBC News Online'', 26 July 2004.</ref> Since then, race relations have improved significantly. 

East Anglia is the leading destination for new migrants and half of the 83,000 who have registered to work in the region have settled in Cambridgeshire. According to a report published by the police in 2007 "the hidden scale of migration into the county is demonstrated by the different number of languages officers and staff deal with, which now exceeds 100. [[Translation]] costs linked to dealing with incidents and crime are close to <U+00A3>1 million a year." The report says the migrant communities have led to a change in the nature of crime in the county, with an increase in [[Driving under the influence|drink-driving]] offences, knife crime and an international dimension added to activities such as running [[cannabis]] factories and [[Trafficking in human beings|human trafficking]]. The number of foreign nationals arrested in the north of the county rose from 894 in 2003 to 2,435 in 2006, but the report also says "inappropriately negative" community perceptions about migrant workers often complicate routine incidents, raising tensions and turning them "critical;" the fact that many new migrants are crowded into privately rented accommodation, often in multiple occupation, is a potentially destabilising factor in many communities, raising problems of [[Noise pollution|noise]], parking, waste disposal, petty [[robbery]], household disputes and [[assault]]s against women in mixed houses.<ref>[http://www.cambs.police.uk/images/newsitem/download/190907growth.pdf "The changing demography of Cambridgeshire: implications for policing"], Cambridgeshire Constabulary and Cambridgeshire Police Authority, 19 September 2007.</ref> [[Julie Spence]] <small>[[OBE]]</small>, the [[Chief Constable]], was careful to add there was "little evidence that the increased numbers of migrant workers have caused significant or systematic problems in respect of community safety or cohesion." She also emphasised that the dramatic change in the county's profile &mdash; from a rural county in which four years ago 95% of teenagers were [[White people|white]] to one of the country's major ethnically mixed growth points &mdash; has had a positive impact in development and jobs. Cambridgeshire's population is one of the fastest growing in Britain and is projected to rise by a further 12.5% or 94,000 by 2016, mostly fulled by 69,000 eastern European migrants.<ref>Travis, Alan [http://www.guardian.co.uk/immigration/story/0,,2172825,00.html "Ministers to assess migrant groups' impact on public services"], ''The Guardian'', London, 20 September 2007.</ref> On 11 March 2008, the [[BBC]] broadcast ''The Poles are Coming!'', a controversial documentary by award-winning filmmaker [[Tim Samuels]], as part of its ''White Season''.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/white/poles.shtml "The Poles are Coming!"], Is white working class Britain becoming invisible?

===Education===
Peterborough has one independent boarding school; [[Peterborough High School]], formerly Westwood House. The school caters for girls up to 18 and boys up to 11. Peterborough's state schools are currently undergoing immense change. Five of the city's 15 [[secondary schools]] were closed in July 2007 and are to be demolished over the coming years. [[John Mansfield School|John Mansfield]], Hereward (formerly Eastholm) and [[Deacon's School|Deacon's]] were replaced with the flagship [[Thomas Deacon Academy]], designed by [[Norman Foster, Baron Foster of Thames Bank|Lord Foster of Thames Bank]] which opened in September 2007.

The Cathedral Church of [[Saint Peter]], [[Paul of Tarsus|Saint Paul]] and [[Saint Andrew]], whose statues look down from the three high gables of the West Front, was originally founded as a [[monastery]] in AD&nbsp;655 and re-built in its present form between 1118 and 1238. It has been the seat of the [[Bishop of Peterborough]] since the [[Diocese]] was created in 1541. [[Peterborough Cathedral]] is known for its imposing early [[English Gothic architecture|English Gothic]] West Front which, with its three enormous arches, is without [[Cathedral architecture of Western Europe|architectural precedent]] and with no direct successor. The Cathedral has the distinction of having had two queens buried beneath its paving, [[Katherine of Aragon]] and [[Mary, Queen of Scots]]. The remains of Queen Mary were later removed to [[Westminster Abbey]] by her son [[James I of England|James I]] when he became King of England.<ref>Sweeting, Walter Debenham.

The general layout of Peterborough is attributed to Martin de Vecti who, as abbot from 1133 to 1155, rebuilt the settlement on dry limestone to the west of the monastery, rather than the often-flooded marshlands to the east. Abbot Martin was responsible for laying out the market place and the wharf beside the river. Peterborough's magnificent seventeenth century Guildhall, built shortly after the [[The Restoration|restoration]] of King [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], is supported by columns, to provide an open ground floor for the butter and poultry markets which used to be held there. The Market Place was renamed Cathedral Square and the adjacent Gates Memorial Fountain moved to Bishop's Road Gardens in 1963, when the weekly market was transferred to the site of the old cattle market.<ref>Skinner, Julia (with particular reference to the work of Robert Cook) ''Did You Know?

The museum exhibits many of the artefacts found, including what is believed to be the oldest wheel in Britain. An exposed section of the Roman road known as the [[Fen Causeway]] also crosses the site.<ref>[[Francis Pryor|Pryor, Francis]] ''Flag Fen: Life and Death of a Prehistoric Landscape'' Tempus Publishing, Stroud, 2005.</ref> 

[[Image:HR icon.png|Heritage Railway]] The [[Nene Valley Railway]], a seven and a half mile (12&nbsp;km) [[heritage railway]], was one of the last passenger lines to fall under the [[Beeching Axe]]. In 1974 the former [[development corporation]] bought the line, running from the city centre to [[Yarwell Junction]] just west of [[Wansford, Cambridgeshire|Wansford]], via [[Orton Mere]] and the 500 acre (202&nbsp;ha) [[Ferry Meadows]] country park, and leased it to the Peterborough Railway Society.<ref>Rhodes, John.

[[Image:CP icon.png|Country Park]] The [[Nene Park, Peterborough|Nene Park]], which opened in 1978, covers a site three and a half miles (5.6&nbsp;km) long, from slightly west of Castor to the centre of Peterborough. The park has three lakes, one of which houses a watersports centre. Ferry Meadows, one of the major destinations and attractions signposted on the [[Green Wheel]], occupies a large portion of Nene Park. Orton Mere provides access to the east of the park.<ref>[http://changingplaces.urbed.com/cgi-bin/main.cgi?org_code=87uytrsqp0gtgtgtgy&option=article&doc_id=238 Changing Places: Case Studies of the Urban Renaissance] The Urban and Economic Development Group (retrieved 2 May 2007).</ref>

==Geography==
===Climate===
According to the [[K<U+00F6>ppen climate classification|K<U+00F6>ppen classification]] the [[British Isles]] experience a [[oceanic climate|maritime climate]] characterised by relatively cool summers and mild winters. Compared with other parts of the country, East Anglia is slightly warmer and sunnier in the summer and colder and frostier in the winter. Owing to its inland position, furthest from the landfall of most [[Atlantic]] depressions, Cambridgeshire is one of the driest counties in the UK, receiving, on average, less than 600&nbsp;mm (2 ft) of rain per year. The mean annual daily duration of bright sunshine is four hours and 12 minutes; the absence of any high ground is probably responsible for the area being one of the sunniest parts of the British Isles.<ref>Brown, Chris [http://www.cambridgeshire.gov.uk/environment/policy/Env_Report_1998.htm State of the Environment Report 1998] Chapter 11: Physical Background (pp.305-306) Cambridgeshire County Council (retrieved 19 July 2007).</ref>

===Topography===
East Anglia is most notable for being almost flat. During the [[Ice Age]] much of the region was covered by ice sheets and this has influenced the topography and nature of the soils.<ref>Brown (p.301).</ref> Much of Cambridgeshire is low-lying, in some places below present-day mean sea level.<ref>Brown (p.304).</ref> The lowest point on land is supposedly just to the south of the city at [[Holme, Cambridgeshire|Holme Fen]], which is 2.75&nbsp;metres (9 ft) below sea level. The largest of the many settlements along the [[Fen]] edge, Peterborough has been called the ''Gateway to the Fens''. Before they were drained [[the Fens]] were liable to periodic flooding so [[Arable land|arable farming]] was limited to the higher areas of the Fen edge, with the rest of the [[Fenland]] dedicated to [[pastoral farming]]. In this way, the medieval and early modern Fens stood in contrast to the rest of southern England, which was primarily arable. Since the advent of modern drainage in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries the Fens have been radically transformed such that arable farming has almost entirely replaced pastoral. The city includes the outlying settlement at [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] Wittering, the ''Home of the [[Harrier Jump Jet|Harrier]]'',<ref>Blatch, James [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/319944.stm "Home of the Harrier"] ''BBC News Online'', 21 April 1999.</ref> and as a unitary authority borders Northamptonshire to the west, Lincolnshire to the north, and non-metropolitan Cambridgeshire to the south and east. The city centre is located at 52<U+00B0>35'N [[latitude]] 0<U+00B0>15'W [[longitude]] or [[Ordnance Survey]] [[British national grid reference system|national grid reference]] TL&nbsp;185&nbsp;998.

===Linguistics===
Peterborough lies in the middle of several distinct regional accent groups and as such has a hybrid of Fenland [[East Anglian English|East Anglian]], [[East Midlands English|East Midland]] and [[London]] [[Estuary English]] features. The city falls just north of the A vowel [[isogloss]] and as such most native speakers will use the [[Phonological history of English short A|flat A]], as found in ''cat'', in words such as ''last''. [[Yod-dropping]] is often heard from Peterborians, as in the rest of East Anglia, for example ''new'' as {{IPA|/nu<U+02D0>/}}. However, the large number of newcomers has impacted greatly on the [[English English|English]] spoken by the younger generation. Common so-called Estuary English features such as [[L-vocalisation]], [[T-glottalisation]] and [[Th-fronting]] give today's Peterborough accent a definite [[South East of England|south-eastern]] sound.<ref>Britain, David [http://www.essex.ac.uk/linguistics/papers/errl_41c.pdf Surviving Estuary English: Innovation diffusion, koineisation and local dialect differentiation in the English Fenland] Essex Research Reports in Linguistics, vol.41 (pp.74-103) University of Essex, Department of Language and Linguistics, 2002.</ref>

===Affiliations===
[[Town twinning]] started in [[Europe]] after the Second World War. Its purpose was to promote friendship and greater understanding between the people of different European cities. A twinning link is a formal, long-term friendship agreement involving co-operation between two communities in different countries and endorsed by both local authorities. The two communities organise projects and activities around a range of issues and develop an understanding of historical, cultural, lifestyle similarities and differences. Peterborough is twinned with the following towns:

{{flagicon|Spain}} [[Alcal<U+00E1> de Henares]], [[Spain]] ''Queen Katherine's birthplace'' (since 1986)<br>
{{flagicon|France}} [[Bourges]], [[France]] (since 1957)<br>
{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Forl<U+00EC>]], [[Italy]] (since 1981)<br>
{{flagicon|Germany}} [[Viersen]], [[Germany]] (since 1982)<br>
{{flagicon|Ukraine}} [[Vinnytsya]], [[Ukraine]] (since 1991)

The city also has more informal friendship links with [[Ballarat]], [[Australia]]; [[Foggia]], Italy; [[Kwe Kwe]], [[Zimbabwe]]; [[P<U+00E9>cs]], [[Hungary]]; and all [[Peterborough (disambiguation)|Peterboroughs]] around the world.<ref>[http://www.peterborough.gov.uk/page-6391 Town Twinning - International Links] Peterborough City Council (retrieved 24 April 2007).</ref> The county of Cambridgeshire has been twinned with [[Viersen (district)|Kreis Viersen]], Germany since 1983.
