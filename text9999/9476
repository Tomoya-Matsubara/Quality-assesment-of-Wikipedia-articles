The '''Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency''' ('''MIGA''') is an [[international financial institution]] which offers [[political risk insurance]] guarantees. Such guarantees help investors protect [[foreign direct investment]]s against [[political risk|political and non-commercial risks]] in [[developing countries]].<ref name="MIGA Overview 2012">{{Cite web | title = Overview | publisher = World Bank Group | author = Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency | url = http://www.miga.org/whoweare/index.cfm | accessdate = 2012-06-25}}</ref> MIGA is a member of the [[World Bank Group]] and is headquartered in [[Washington, D.C.]], [[United States]].

MIGA is owned and governed by its member states, but has its own executive leadership and staff which carry out its daily operations. Its [[shareholder]]s are member governments which provide [[paid in capital|paid-in capital]] and have the right to vote on its matters. It insures long-term [[debt]] and [[equity (finance)|equity]] investments as well as other assets and contracts with long-term periods. The agency is assessed by an independent evaluator each year. Its 2011 evaluation recommended that it utilize its recently expanded investing capacity and closely monitor projects' profitability to better understand their impacts on its financial performance. MIGA's total investments amounted to $1.1&nbsp;billion in 2011. It issued $2.1&nbsp;billion worth of new investment guarantees in 2011 and held $1.5&nbsp;million in total assets.<ref name="MIGA Annual Report 2011">{{Cite report | title = MIGA Annual Report 2011: Insuring Investments, Ensuring Opportunities | publisher = World Bank Group | date = 2011 | author = Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency | url = http://www.miga.org/documents/11ar_english.pdf | accessdate = 2012-06-25}}</ref>

==History==
In September 1985, the Board of Governors of the [[World Bank]] endorsed the Convention Establishing the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency. MIGA was established and became operational on April 12, 1988 under the leadership of then-Executive Vice President [[Yoshio Terasawa]], becoming the fifth member institution of the World Bank Group. MIGA initially had $1 billion ($1.94 billion in 2012 dollars<ref name="BLS 2012">{{Cite web | title = CPI Inflation Calculator | publisher = U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics | url = http://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm | accessdate = 2012-06-20}}</ref>) in capital and 29 member states. All members of the [[International Bank for Reconstruction and Development]] (IBRD) were eligible to become members of the agency. MIGA was established as an effort to complement existing sources of non-commercial risk insurance for investments in developing countries, and thereby improve investor confidence.<ref name="MIGA History 2012" /> The agency's mandate to be [[apolitical]] has been said to be an advantage over private and national risk insurance markets. By serving as a [[multilateralism|multilateral]] guarantor, the agency reduces the likelihood of confrontations among the investor's country and the host country.<ref name="Donovan 2003">{{Cite journal | title = Creeping expropriation and MIGA: The need for tighter regulation in the political risk insurance market | journal = Gonzaga Journal of International Law | volume = 7 | year = 2003 | author = Donovan, Patrick J. | url = http://www.gonzagajil.org/pdf/volume7/Donovan/ | accessdate = 2012-06-27}}</ref>

MIGA's inaugural investment guarantees were issued in 1990 to cover $1.04&nbsp;billion ($1.83&nbsp;billion in 2012&nbsp;dollars<ref name="BLS 2012" />) worth of foreign direct investment&nbsp;(FDI) comprising four individual projects. The agency also issued its first [[reinsurance]] contracts signed in collaboration with [[Export Development Canada]] and the United States' [[Overseas Private Investment Corporation]] (OPIC). That same year, MIGA held a conference in [[Ghana]] to promote investment. The agency joined the [[Berne Union]], an international community of [[trade credit insurance|export credit]] and investment insurance providers in 1994. In 1997, MIGA issued the inaugural contract under its Cooperative Underwriting Program to support an energy project in [[Indonesia]]. In collaboration with the European Union Investment Trust Fund for [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], the agency setup a fund for investment guarantees amounting to $12&nbsp;million ($17&nbsp;million in 2012&nbsp;dollars<ref name="BLS 2012" />). The agency also established the West Bank and Gaza Investment Guarantee Trust Fund with a capacity of $20&nbsp;million ($29&nbsp;million in 2012&nbsp;dollars<ref name="BLS 2012" />). In 1998 the Council of Governors of MIGA adopted a resolution establishing a general capital increase of $850&nbsp;million ($1.2&nbsp;billion in 2012&nbsp;dollars<ref name="BLS 2012" />), and transferring a [[grant (money)|grant]] of $150&nbsp;million ($212&nbsp;million in 2012&nbsp;dollars<ref name="BLS 2012" />) from the IBRD. MIGA exceeded $1&nbsp;billion ($1.4&nbsp;billion in 2012 dollars<ref name="BLS 2012" />) in investment guarantees within a single year for the first time in 1999. The agency also approved an Environmental Assessment and Disclosure Policy and began attempting to implement such standards for new projects.<ref name="MIGA History 2012" />

In 2000 MIGA paid its first [[insurance claim]] since the agency's founding. In 2001 MIGA's issuance of new investment guarantees grew to $2&nbsp;billion. The agency launched its Small Investment Program in 2005 in an effort to promote investment among [[small and medium enterprises]]. That same year, MIGA setup its Afghanistan Investment Guarantee Facility in an effort to promote FDI into Afghanistan. In 2007 MIGA issued investment guarantees for a [[Djibouti]] port, marking its first support in the form of [[Islamic finance]]. The agency also launched PRI-Center.com as a portal for information on political risk management and investment insurance, which also contains its FDI information services. In 2009, the Board of Directors enacted changes to MIGA's operating procedures and authorized coverage for default of sovereign financial obligations. The agency also launched an annual publication titled World Investment and Political Risk which reports on trends in worldwide investment and corporate perceptions of prospects and risk, as well as [[market trend|shifts]] in the political risk insurance industry.<ref name="MIGA History 2012" />

Although once dominated by large public and multilateral [[underwriting|underwriters]], private insurance firms accounted for approximately half of the political risk insurance market in 2007. As a result, MIGA has paid closer attention to exceptionally risky countries that have little appeal to foreign investors, and has insured projects among nations in the [[South-South cooperation|global south]].<ref name="The Economist 2007">{{Cite news | title = Of coups and coverage | date = 2007-04-04 | publisher = The Economist | url = http://www.economist.com/node/8967224 | accessdate = 2012-06-26}}</ref> MIGA conducted a survey in 2010 which showed that political risk is the most important deterrent of long-term foreign direct investment in developing countries, even more than [[economic stability|economic uncertainty]] and poor [[public infrastructure]].<ref name="The Economist 2011">{{Cite news | title = How to become politics-proof | date = 2011-03-31 | publisher = The Economist | url = http://www.economist.com/node/18486071 | accessdate = 2012-06-26}}</ref> MIGA's Council of Governors amended the agency's convention in 2010 in an attempt to improve the organization's effectiveness by expanding the range of investments eligible for political risk insurance.<ref name="MIGA Press Release 2010">{{Cite press release | title = MIGA Significantly Expands Pool of Eligible Investments | date = 2010-11-15 | publisher = Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency | url = http://www.miga.org/news/index.cfm?stid=1520&aid=2823 | accessdate = 2012-06-26}}</ref><ref name="Carr 2012">{{Cite news | title = Political-risk insurer underused as climate talks fail | author = Carr, Mathew | date = 2012-05-10 | publisher = Bloomberg | url = http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-05-09/world-bank-political-risk-insurer-underused-30-in-climate-fight.html | accessdate = 2012-07-06}}</ref>

MIGA is evaluated each year by the World Bank's [[Independent Evaluation Group]]. In 2011 the group published an evaluation report titled "MIGA's Financial Sector Guarantees in a Strategic Context" in which it recommended the agency take greater advantage of the expanded range of eligible investments allowed by its recent convention amendments, citing a significant capacity not yet fully exploited. The group also strongly advised MIGA to measure individual projects' contributions (or costs) to MIGA's income to better identify how specific projects may affect its income and make more-selective decisions about which projects to underwrite.<ref name="IEG 2011">{{Cite report | title = MIGA's Financial Sector Guarantees in a Strategic Context | publisher = World Bank Group | date = 2011 | author = Independent Evaluation Group | url = http://lnweb90.worldbank.org/oed/oeddoclib.nsf/DocUNIDViewForJavaSearch/744A3E09A22D26D7852578D500595A27/$file/MIGA2011_AR.pdf | accessdate = 2012-06-25}}</ref>

==Investment guarantees==

The agency's Small Investment Program aims to promote FDI into specifically small and medium enterprises. The program offers standard MIGA coverage types except it does not cover breaches of contract. Under the program, small and medium enterprises may take advantage of discounted insurance premiums and no application fees, which are not available to larger investors. To qualify an investment for the Small Investment Program, MIGA defines small and medium enterprise projects as having 300 or fewer employees, total [[asset]]s not to exceed $15&nbsp;million and annual [[revenue]]s not to exceed $15&nbsp;million. MIGA limits the request amount for the investment guarantee to $10&nbsp;million, and will guarantee only up to 10&nbsp;years with a possible 5-year extension.<ref name="MIGA Small Investment Program 2012">{{Cite web | title = Small Investment Program | publisher = World Bank Group | author = Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency | url = http://www.miga.org/investmentguarantees/index.cfm?stid=1801 | accessdate = 2012-06-27}}</ref>
