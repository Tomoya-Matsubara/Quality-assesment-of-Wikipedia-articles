==History==
The railway was incorporated on 20 May 1851. The line opened on 1 March 1852 (for goods) included a branch to Port Dinorwic (Y Felinheli). Passenger services commenced on 1 March 1852, with the C&HR leasing the line for 999 years later in 1852. This arrangement continued until the C&HR received powers to take over the line in 1854, although did not exercise these powers until 15 July 1867.<ref name="Awdry"/>

==Connections to other lines==

==Current operations==
The line closed entirely on 5 January 1970.

Following the [[Britannia Bridge]] fire in 1970, the Menai Bridge to Caernarfon line was temporarily reopened to handle container traffic for Holyhead. This traffic ceased and the line closed again in January 1972.
