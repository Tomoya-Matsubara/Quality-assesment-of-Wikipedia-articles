The '''Wallkill Valley Rail Trail''' is a {{convert|23.7|mi|km|adj=on}} rail trail and [[linear park]] that runs along the former [[Wallkill Valley Railroad]] rail corridor in [[Ulster County, New York]]. The trail serves hikers, joggers, bikers, horseback riders, and cross country skiers. It currently runs from [[Gardiner, New York|Gardiner]] through [[New Paltz, New York|New Paltz]] to [[Rosendale, New York|Rosendale]].<ref name="history" /> The addition of an {{convert|11.5|mi|km|adj=on}} section in 2009 effectively doubled the length of the trail from {{convert|12.2|mi|km}} to {{convert|23.7|mi|km}},<ref name="rahl-seizure-2" /> extending it north from Rosendale through [[Ulster, New York|Ulster]] to [[Kingston, New York|Kingston]].<ref name="rahl-seizure-1" /> Ulster County drafted plans in 2008 to connect the trail with both the [[Shawangunk Rail Trail]] to the south and [[Hudson Valley Rail Trail]] to the east.<ref name="ny299-plan" />

There are several former rail bridges along the trail, notably the Rosendale [[trestle]], a {{convert|940|ft|m|adj=on}} bridge that can be considered the "most awesome part" of the former Wallkill Valley Railroad.<ref name="mabee-18-20" /> The trail passes by several historic sites, such as the [[Huguenot Street Historic District]] in New Paltz,<ref name="huguenot" /> the [[Binnewater Historic District]] and [[Snyder Estate Natural Cement Historic District]] in Rosendale,<ref name="nrhpinv_ny" /> as well as a defunct 19th-century [[creamery]] in Gardiner.<ref name="mobius" /> It crosses both the [[Wallkill River]] and [[Rondout Creek]], as well as Route [[U.S. Route 44 in New York|44]]/[[New York State Route 55|55]], [[New York State Route 299|NY 299]], and [[New York State Route 213|NY 213]].<ref name="ny299-plan" /> The [[Shawangunk Ridge]] is visible from clearings along the rail.<ref name="fink" /> Passing through a variety of habitats, the trail is frequented by many types of birds and animals.<ref name="nature" />

=== New Paltz and Gardiner ===
[[Image:Plattekill Creek Bridge from the north.JPG|thumb|right|The steel-span Plattekill Creek bridge at the border between New Paltz and Gardiner]]
In 1988, New Paltz invited a local non-profit, the Wallkill Valley Land Trust, to acquire the portion of the rail line between New Paltz and Gardiner. The Wallkill Valley Land Trust in turn requested assistance from [[The Trust for Public Land]], and the purchase was completed on January 18, 1991.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mabee|1995|pp=141<U+2013>143}}</ref> While the town and [[New Paltz (village), New York|village of New Paltz]] immediately purchased their sections from the Wallkill Valley Land Trust <U+2013> roughly {{convert|4|and|3|mi|km}}, respectively<ref name="Mabee-141">{{Harvnb|Mabee|1995|p=141}}</ref> <U+2013> Gardiner did not purchase its {{convert|6|mi|km|adj=on}} section until 2007.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.recordonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061230/NEWS/61229029 |title=State money will help expand rail trail in Gardiner |date=2006-12-30 |accessdate=2010-11-02 |newspaper=[[Times Herald-Record]] |publisher=[[Dow Jones Local Media Group]] |location=Middletown, NY}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.wallkillvalleylt.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=60&Itemid=95 |title=Wallkill Valley Rail Trail in Gardiner |publisher=Wallkill Valley Land Trust |accessdate=2010-11-02}}</ref>

The Gardiner section begins {{convert|3|mi|km}} south of the [[Gardiner (CDP), New York|hamlet of Gardiner]] at Denniston Road, and continues on through New Paltz.<ref name="frequently">{{Cite web |url=http://www.townofgardiner.org/FAQ_Parks_Recreation.cfm |title=Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Town of Gardiner |accessdate=2010-11-05}}</ref> Prior to its 2007 purchase the Gardiner section was unmaintained, and by 2004 it was in such a state of disrepair that the Wallkill Valley Land Trust almost closed it. Purchasing the section allowed Gardiner to fix the drainage problems that had deteriorated the surface of the trail, and to ban the use of [[motor vehicle]]s, something the Wallkill Valley Land Trust had not done. Gardiner worked out a $70,000 sale price with the Wallkill Valley Land Trust in 2004, though the property at that time was worth $307,300. The Gardiner section passes by a defunct creamery.<ref name="mobius">{{Cite web |url=http://mobiusconsultants.com/Trailgrant.pdf |title=Acquisition and Development of the Gardiner Rail Trail |date=2006-05-26 |accessdate=2010-11-07 |publisher=[[New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation|NYS OPRHP]] |work=Acquisition Application 2006 EPF Grant |pages=1<U+2013>7}}</ref> The creamery, opened in 1882, was one of the dairies that transported its products to [[New York City]] by way of the Wallkill Valley Railroad.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mabee|1995|pp=90<U+2013>95}}</ref> The former Gardiner railroad station became a sporting goods store by 1981,<ref>{{Harvnb|Mabee|1995|p=137}}</ref> an antique store by 1995,<ref>{{Harvnb|Mabee|1995|p=152}}</ref> and burned down in January 2001.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://archive.recordonline.com/archive/2002/12/01/latebrie.htm |title=News briefs |date=2002-12-01 |accessdate=2010-11-02 |newspaper=[[Times Herald-Record]] |publisher=[[Dow Jones Local Media Group]] |location=Middletown, NY}}</ref>

[[Image:Wallkill River Bridge.jpg|thumb|left|The Springtown truss bridge that carries the trail over the Wallkill River]]
There are two notable bridges within the New Paltz section, the [[Plattekill Creek]] bridge along the southern border with Gardiner, and the Springtown bridge to the north. Both were originally made of timber and constructed in 1870.<ref name="plattekill-springtown">{{Harvnb|Mabee|1995|pp=12<U+2013>13}}</ref> A passing train accidentally set fire to the Plattekill Creek bridge in 1880, prompting the Wallkill Valley Railroad to coat its [[Railroad tie|ties]] with tin while replacing its wooden bridges with ones made of stone.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mabee|1995|p=61}}</ref> The bridge was rebuilt in 1912, and crosses the Plattekill Creek at a height of {{convert|35|ft|m}}.

The Springtown bridge spans the [[Wallkill River]],<ref name="plattekill-springtown" /> and was rebuilt using iron in 1881. It was rated by the superintendent of the Wallkill Valley Railroad to be safe for rail traffic as fast as {{convert|40|mph|km/h}}.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mabee|1995|pp=128<U+2013>130}}</ref> The bridge's current decking and benches were put in place in 1993 by volunteers and members of the nearby [[Hutterite]] community in [[Rifton, New York|Rifton]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Mabee|1995|pp=143<U+2013>144}}</ref> It is {{convert|291|ft|m}} long, with a trestle length of {{convert|122|ft|m}}, and has 420 bridge ties.<ref>A signpost west of the Springtown Road crossing, placed by the Wallkill Valley Rail Trail Association.</ref>
