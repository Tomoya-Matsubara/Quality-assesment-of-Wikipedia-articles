'''Philippicus''' or '''Philippikos''' ({{lang-el|<U+03A6><U+03B9><U+03BB><U+03B9><U+03C0><U+03C0><U+03B9><U+03BA><U+03CC><U+03C2>}}, fl. 580s<U+2013>610s) was an [[Byzantine Empire|East Roman]] general, ''[[comes excubitorum]]'', and brother-in-law of Emperor [[Maurice (emperor)|Maurice]] (r. 582<U+2013>602). His successful career as a general spanned several decades, chiefly against the [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid Persians]].

==Biography==
===Under Maurice===
[[File:Roman-Persian Frontier in Late Antiquity.svg|thumb|right|300px|Map of the Roman-Persian frontier.]]

Little is known about Philippicus's early years. He was married to Maurice's sister Gordia, probably in 583,<ref name=PLRE1022>{{harvnb|Martindale|Jones|Morris|1992|p=1022}}.</ref> and was at some point raised to the high rank of ''[[patrikios|patricius]]''.<ref name=PLRE1025>{{harvnb|Martindale|Jones|Morris|1992|p=1025}}.</ref> At about the same time, he was appointed ''[[comes excubitorum]]'' (Commander of the [[Excubitors]], the imperial bodyguard), and in 584, he replaced [[John Mystacon]] as ''[[magister militum]]'' for the East, thus becoming responsible for the conduct of the [[Byzantine<U+2013>Sassanid War of 572<U+2013>591|ongoing war]] against the Persians of the [[Sassanid Empire]].<ref name=PLRE1022/>

He commanded numerous campaigns in 584 through 585, ravaging the plains near [[Nisibis]],<ref name=PLRE1022/> and making inroads in the regions of [[Arzanene]] and eastern [[Mesopotamia]].<ref name=PLRE1023>{{harvnb|Martindale|Jones|Morris|1992|p=1023}}.</ref> During the same period, he actively tried to improve the discipline and efficiency of his troops.<ref>{{harvnb|Whitby|1988|p=13}}.</ref>

He spent the winter of 585-586 in [[Constantinople]], and returned to his headquarters in [[Amida (Roman city)|Amida]] in the spring.<ref name=PLRE1023/> After Persian peace proposals were rejected, he advanced his troops to the frontier, where he defeated a superior Persian force under [[Kardarigan (6th century)|Kardarigan]] at the [[Battle of Solachon]].<ref name=PLRE1023/> He then proceeded to invade and plunder Arzanene and besieged the fortress of Chlomaron.<ref name=PLRE1023/> However, the approach of a Persian relief army panicked the Romans, who fled in disorder back into Roman territory.<ref name=PLRE1023/> There, possibly due to illness, he handed over command of his army to his ''[[hypostrategos]]'' (lieutenant general) [[Heraclius the Elder|Heraclius]], the father of the future [[Byzantine emperor]] [[Heraclius]].<ref name=PLRE1023/> In spring 587, he was again ill, and unable to campaign in person. He assigned two-thirds of his army to Heraclius and the remainder to generals Theodore and Andreas, and sent them to raid Persian territory. He did not campaign himself that year, and in the winter, he set off towards Constantinople. On his way, he learned that he had been replaced by [[Priscus (general)|Priscus]].<ref name=PLRE1023/><ref>{{harvnb|Greatrex|Lieu|2002|p=170}}.</ref>

However, when Priscus arrived in the East, the soldiers refused to obey him, and elected ''[[dux]]'' of [[Phoenice Libanensis]], Germanus, in his stead. Philippicus, who was soon re-appointed as commander of the East, could only assume his command after the mutiny was quelled through the intervention of the [[Greek Patriarch of Antioch|patriarch]] of [[Antioch]].<ref name=PLRE1024>{{harvnb|Martindale|Jones|Morris|1992|p=1024}}.</ref> After a public reconciliation with his troops, in the summer of 589 he campaigned against the city of [[Martyropolis]], which had recently fallen to the Persians through the treasonous defection of a Roman officer named Sittas. He was, however, unable to retake it, and was defeated by a Persian relief force led by Mahbodh and Aphrarat. Upon this failure, he was replaced by [[Comentiolus]].<ref name=PLRE1024/><ref>{{harvnb|Greatrex|Lieu|2002|pp=170<U+2013>171}}.</ref>

Except for a diplomatic mission in 590 to the deposed Persian ruler [[Khosrau II]] (r. 590<U+2013>628), who had taken refuge in Roman territory, Philippicus disappears from the scene for several years.<ref name=PLRE1024/> In 598, he was briefly appointed general in the [[Maurice's Balkan campaigns|Balkans]],<ref>{{harvnb|Whitby|1988|pp=122<U+2013>123}}.</ref> and is credited by some sources with a victory over the [[Eurasian Avars|Avars]] in [[Thrace]],<ref>{{harvnb|Martindale|Jones|Morris|1992|pp=1024<U+2013>1025}}.</ref> although this is most likely due to a confusion with general Priscus.<ref>{{harvnb|Whitby|1988|p=129}}.</ref>

===Under Phocas and Heraclius===
At some point in 602, suspicions fell upon him of plotting against Emperor Maurice, since a [[prophecy]] stated that the name of Maurice's successor would begin with a ''<U+03A6>'' ([[Phi (letter)|Phi]]).<ref name=PLRE1025/> Indeed soon after, Maurice was deposed and killed by a revolt in the Balkanic army led by [[Phocas]]. As a close associate of Maurice, Philippicus was forced to enter a monastery in [[Chrysopolis]] as a [[monk]].<ref name=PLRE1025/><ref>{{harvnb|Whitby|1988|p=15}}.</ref> He was still at the [[monastery]] when [[Heraclius]] overthrew Phocas in 610, and was sent by the new [[Byzantine emperor]] to negotiate with Phocas's brother, [[Comentiolus (brother of Phocas)|Comentiolus]], who commanded the eastern army.<ref name=PLRE1025/> He was imprisoned by Comentiolus and was to be executed, but was saved when Comentiolus himself was murdered.<ref name=PLRE1025/>

In 612, he was again appointed by Heraclius as ''magister militum per Orientem'' succeeding the disgraced [[Priscus (general)|Priscus]], and campaigned against the Persians in [[Armenia]]. In 614, as a Persian army under [[Shahin Vahmanzadegan|Shahin]] [[Shahin's invasion of Asia Minor (615)|invaded Asia Minor]] and reached the shores of the [[Bosporus]] at [[Chalcedon]], Philippicus invaded Persia, hoping to cause Shahin to withdraw in order to confront him.<ref name=PLRE1025/>

Philippicus died shortly after, and was buried in a [[church (building)|church]] he had built at Chrysopolis.<ref name=PLRE1025/>

==Possible authorship of the ''Strategikon''==
As one of the leading generals of his day, and with both the time and opportunity to write it sometime after 603, during the years he spent in a monastery, Philippicus is one of the possible authors of the [[Byzantine military manuals|Byzantine military treatise]] known as the ''[[Strategikon of Maurice|Strategikon]]'' and traditionally attributed to Maurice.<ref>{{cite web|last=McCotter|first=Stephen|title='The Nation which Forgets its Defenders will Itself be Forgotten': Emperor Maurice and the Persians|work=Queen<U+2019>s University of Belfast|year=2003|accessdate=26 January 2012|publisher=deremilitari.org|url=http://www.deremilitari.org/resources/articles/mccotter2.htm}}</ref>
