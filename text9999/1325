'''''Suite Habana''''' is a [[2003 in film|2003]] [[Cuba]]n documentary directed by [[Fernando P<U+00E9>rez]].

The documentary was filmed with fictional cinema techniques depicting a day in a life of thirteen real people, from a ten-year-old child with [[Down Syndrome]] to a 79-year-old lady who sells peanuts in the street.

The film has no dialogue, using sound and image to evoke emotional effect. Several stories are juxtaposed to convey the plot points, an unusual approach in [[Cuban cinema]], where spoken words are often used extensively.

==Critical reception==
After the film's premiere in Cuba, national critics ranked it as one of the best Cuban films in decades. The film gathered several awards at international film festivals. ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' called it "A lyrical, meticulously crafted and unexpectedly melancholy homage to the battered but resilient inhabitants of a battered but resilient city."
