'''Emanuel David Gin<U+00F3>bili''' (born 28 July 1977 in [[Bah<U+00ED>a Blanca]], [[Argentina]]), better known as Manu Gin<U+00F3>bili, is an [[Argentine]] basketball player of [[Italian people|Italian descent]]. Coming from a family of professional basketballers, he is a member of the [[Argentine national basketball team]] and the [[San Antonio Spurs]] in the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA). 

Gin<U+00F3>bili spent the early half of his basketball career in Argentina and [[Italy]], where he won several individual and team honors. His stint with Italian side [[Kinder Bologna]] was particularly productive, earning two [[Serie A (basketball)|Lega A]] [[Most Valuable Player]] awards, one [[Euroleague]] MVP award and the 2001 League Championship. The San Antonio Spurs drafted the shooting guard as the 57th overall pick in the [[1999 NBA Draft]], but Gin<U+00F3>bili only joined the Spurs in 2002. He did not take long to establish himself as a key player for the Spurs, and has since won three NBA championships with the [[Texas]] side as well as being named an [[NBA All-Star|All-Star]] once.

With the national team, Gin<U+00F3>bili has also enjoyed success. He made his d<U+00E9>but in 1998, and was a member of the team which won the goal medal during the [[2004 Olympics]]. Hailed as one of the finest Europe-based players to grace the NBA with his high-tempo and intensive game, Gin<U+00F3>bili is also the only basketball player ever to win a Euroleague title, an NBA championship, and an Olympic gold medal.

==Family and personal life==
Gin<U+00F3>bili comes from a family of basketball players. His older brothers Sebasti<U+00E1>n and Leandro have played professionally in Argentina and Spain respectively, while their father Jorge was a coach at a club in [[Bah<U+00ED>a Blanca]], where Gin<U+00F3>bili learned to play the game.<ref name=mysan>Ludden, Johnny, [http://www.mysanantonio.com/sports/basketball/nba/spurs/stories/MYSA061105.1S.BKNspurs.ginobili.3009da155.html "Mover and shaker: Motor always has been running for Spurs' Ginobili"], mysanantonio.com, [[11 June]] [[2005]], accessed [[18 August]] [[2007]].</ref> Given the proliferation of basketball clubs in Bah<U+00ED>a Blanca and his idolization of [[Michael Jordan]], Gin<U+00F3>bili's love for basketball grew rapidly.<ref name=jock>[http://www.jockbio.com/Bios/Ginobili/Ginobili_bio.html Manu Ginobili - Bio], jockbio.com, accessed [[18 August]] [[2007]].</ref>

Like many Argentines, Gin<U+00F3>bili is a descendant of [[Italy|Italian]] immigrants, and he has [[dual citizenship]] with Argentina and Italy.<ref name=espn>Hollinger, John, [http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/insider/columns/story?columnist=hollinger_john&page=All-World-30Best&lpos=spotlight&lid=tab3pos1 "The 30 best international players in the NBA"], sports.espn.com, [[27 April]] [[2007]], accessed [[17 June]] [[2007]].</ref> As a result of his travels, he can speak [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[English language|English]] fluently.<ref name=bio/> In his free time, Gin<U+00F3>bili  enjoys surfing the internet, listening to [[Latin music]], watching movies and relaxing with his friends.<ref name=bio/> In 2004, he married Marie Orono.<ref name=bio/>

==Professional career==
===Argentine and Italian years===
Gin<U+00F3>bili made his professional d<U+00E9>but in the [[Liga Nacional de B<U+00E1>squetbol|Argentine basketball league]] for the Andino Sport Club team of [[La Rioja, Argentina|La Rioja]] from 1995&ndash;1996, and was traded to [[Estudiantes de Bah<U+00ED>a Blanca]] the next year.<ref name=bio>[http://www.nba.com/playerfile/emanuel_ginobili/bio.html Manu Ginoboli Info Page - Bio], nba.com, accessed [[17 June]] [[2007]].</ref> He played with his hometown team until the [[Serie A (basketball)|Italian league]] attracted him, and in 1998 he moved to [[Europe]], spending the 1998<U+2013>1999 and 1999<U+2013>2000 seasons with [[Viola Reggio Calabria|Basket Viola Reggio Calabria]].<ref name=bio/> Gin<U+00F3>bili then entered the [[1999 NBA Draft]] and the [[San Antonio Spurs]] selected him late in the second round with the 57th overall pick.<ref name=inter>[http://www.interbasket.net/players/ginobili.htm Manu Ginobili, Argentina], interbasket.net, accessed [[17 June]] [[2007]].</ref> However, he did not sign with the Spurs at this point in time. Instead, he returned to Italy to play for [[Virtus Bologna|Kinder Bologna]], which he helped win the 2001 Italian Championship, the 2001 and 2002 Italian Cups, and the 2001 [[Euroleague]], where he was named [[Most Valuable Player]] (MVP).<ref name=bio/> He was also named League MVP in 2000<U+2013>01 and 2001<U+2013>02, and made the Italian league's [[All-Star]] game three times during this period.<ref name=bio/>

===San Antonio Spurs===
[[Image:ManuSpurs.jpg|thumb|right|135px|Gin<U+00F3>bili playing for the Spurs.]]
It was not until after the [[2002 FIBA World Championship]] in [[Indianapolis, Indiana|Indianapolis]] that Gin<U+00F3>bili joined the Spurs. In that tournament, he made the All-Tournament team alongside future NBA star [[Yao Ming]] and established NBA stars [[Dirk Nowitzki]] and [[Peja Stojakovic]],<ref>[http://www.insidehoops.com/world-basketball-championship.shtml FIBA World Basketball Championships], insidehoops.com, accessed [[18 August]] [[2007]].</ref> and helped lead Argentina to a second-place finish.<ref name=bio/> In [[2002-03 NBA season|his first season]] in the NBA, Gin<U+00F3>bili played backup for veteran guard [[Steve Smith (basketball)|Steve Smith]].<ref name=jock/> He spent much of the early season injured, and found it hard to adjust to the NBA's style of play. As his injury improved, so did Gin<U+00F3>bili, winning the [[Western Conference (NBA)|Western Conference]] Rookie of the Month in March, and being named to the All-Rookie Second Team at the end of the season.<ref name=bio/> Still, he only started in five games as the Spurs chalked up a 60-22 regular season win-loss record.<ref name=stats>[http://www.nba.com/playerfile/emanuel_ginobili/career_stats.html Manu Ginobili Info Page - Stats], nba.com, accessed [[9 June]] [[2007]].</ref><ref>[http://www.nba.com/history/standings/20022003.html 2002-03 Standings], nba.com/history, accessed [[9 June]] [[2007]].</ref> The Spurs then entered [[2003 NBA Playoffs|the playoffs]] eager to upset favorites [[Los Angeles Lakers]], and this was when Gin<U+00F3>bili rose to prominence.

In contrast to his regular season, Gin<U+00F3>bili became an integral part of [[Gregg Popovich]]'s rotational set up in the playoffs, playing in every game.<ref name=bio/> The Spurs eliminated Phoenix and Los Angeles<ref name=pot>[http://www.nba.com/history/playoffs/20022003.html 2003 Playoff Results], nba.com/history, accessed [[9 June]] [[2007]].</ref> and in those games his scoring threat took opponents by surprise, giving them one more thing to cope with against the now highly-favored Spurs. He helped guide them past the [[Dallas Mavericks]] in the Western Conference Finals and then the [[New Jersey Nets]] in the [[2003 NBA Finals|Finals]],<ref name=pot/> securing San Antonio's second ever championship. After the win, Gin<U+00F3>bili was named Argentina's top sportsman in the country's main newspaper, [[Clar<U+00ED>n (newspaper)|Clar<U+00ED>n]], and even met Argentine president [[N<U+00E9>stor Kirchner]].<ref name=jock/> A gym in Bah<U+00ED>a Blanca was dedicated in Gin<U+00F3>bili's honor as well.<ref name=jock/>

[[Image:Ginobili y Kirchner-1jul05-presidencia-govar.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Gin<U+00F3>bili with the President of Argentina [[N<U+00E9>stor Kirchner]].]]
In the [[2003-04 NBA season]], Gin<U+00F3>bili began featuring more regularly for the Spurs, starting in half of the 77 regular season games he played in.<ref name=stats/> His statistics improved in all major categories, as he averaged 12.8 [[point (basketball)|points]], 4.5 [[rebound (basketball)|rebounds]], 3.8 [[assist (basketball)|assists]] and 1.8 [[steal (basketball)|steals]] per game.<ref name=stats/> During [[2004 NBA Playoffs|the playoffs]], the Spurs met perennial rivals Los Angeles Lakers in the Western Conference Semifinals. Following a controversial Game 5 where [[Derek Fisher]] scored a [[buzzer beater|buzzer-beating]] [[jumpshot]],<ref>[http://www.nba.com/games/20040513/LALSAS/recap.html Fisher<U+2019>s Jumper Gives Lakers Dramatic Game 5 Win], nba.com, [[13 May]] [[2004]], accessed [[9 June]] [[2007]].</ref> the Spurs lost Game 6 and lost the series 2<U+2013>4.<ref>[http://www.nba.com/playoffs2004/ataglance.html At a Glance], nba.com, accessed [[17 June]] [[2007]].</ref> While Gin<U+00F3>bili did not start in a single playoff game as he did in 2003, his playoff statistics improved significantly, with 13.0 points, 5.3 rebounds and 3.1 assists per game.<ref name=stats/>

After some issues with San Antonio over his contract, Gin<U+00F3>bili re-signed with the Spurs and he started in every game in the [[2004-05 NBA season|2004-05 season]].<ref name=stats/> This was his best season yet as he was selected as a reserve by NBA coaches to the 2005 Western Conference [[All-Star]] team, marking his d<U+00E9>but in the elite mid-season showcase.<ref name=bio/> During [[2005 NBA Playoffs|the playoffs]], Gin<U+00F3>bili's play was pivotal to winning San Antonio's third ever championship. The Spurs first defeated Phoenix 4<U+2013>1 in the Conference Finals,<ref>[http://www.nba.com/playoffs2005/ataglance.html At a Glance], nba.com, accessed [[17 June]] [[2007]].</ref> before prevailing in a very defensive seven-game series against the [[Detroit Pistons]].<ref>[http://www.nba.com/games/20050623/DETSAS/recap.html Spurs Dethrone Pistons To Take Third NBA Title], nba.com, [[23 June]] [[2005]], accessed [[17 June]] [[2007]].</ref> Gin<U+00F3>bili recorded career-highs in his playoff numbers, most notably 20.8 ppg and 5.8 rpg,<ref name=stats/> and had the third highest point total in the entire playoffs.<ref name=bio/> In the [[NBA Finals MVP Award]] voting, the shooting guard was a candidate but was edged out by teammate and captain [[Tim Duncan]].<ref name=jock/> The former finished the 2004-05 season as the second leading scorer on the team.<ref name=bio/> 

[[Image:Gino20.jpg|thumb|Manu Ginobili|130px|right|Gin<U+00F3>bili in a game against the [[Los Angeles Lakers]].]]
The [[2005-06 NBA season|2005-06 season]] was an injury-plagued one for Gin<U+00F3>bili, who suffered foot and ankle injuries that hindered his ability to play. He managed 65 games in the regular season, but saw a dip in major statistics as compared to the previous season.<ref name=stats/> During [[2006 NBA Playoffs|the playoffs]], he returned to form, but was unable to prevent the Spurs from being eliminated by the [[Dallas Mavericks]] in the Conference Semifinals.<ref>[http://www.nba.com/playoffs2006/ataglance.html At a Glance], nba.com, accessed [[17 June]] [[2007]].</ref> In the [[2006-07 NBA season|2006-07 season]], Gin<U+00F3>bili started in only 36 of 75 games, his second lowest since arriving at San Antonio.<ref name=stats/> Despite being second choice to [[Michael Finley]] as the starting shooting guard, Gin<U+00F3>bili produced numbers closely identical to his successful 2004-05 campaign.<ref name=stats/> The [[2007 NBA Playoffs]] saw him help the Spurs to defeat the [[Denver Nuggets]], [[Phoenix Suns]] and [[Utah Jazz]], before sweeping the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] to win his third and San Antonio's fourth championship.<ref>[http://www.nba.com/finals2007/series/index.html Parker, Spurs Close Out Cavs for Fourth Title] nba.com, [[15 June]] [[2007]], accessed [[17 June]] [[2007]].</ref>

Gin<U+00F3>bili is a 6 ft 6 in (1.98 m), 205 lb (93 kg) [[shooting guard]]<ref name=bio/> who has been deployed either as a [[sixth man]] or starter for the Spurs. He has established himself as a reliable and versatile backcourt presence, and is a relatively late bloomer, entering the NBA at age 25 in a period where [[prep-to-pro|entering the NBA as a teenager]] was very common.<ref name=jock/> Alongside teammates [[Tony Parker]] and Tim Duncan, he forms one of the centerpieces of San Antonio's game.<ref name=jock/>

Apart from his up-tempo and aggressive style of play, Gin<U+00F3>bili is known for his [[clutch (sports)|clutch play]].<ref name=mysan/> This is documented by his numerous European league MVP awards, 2004 Olympic tournament MVP, and his performances in San Antonio's 2004-05 championship-winning campaign. Gin<U+00F3>bili's ''[[modus operandi]]'' however, is a source of consternation for some of his opponents. A fierce attacker of the basket, he often lowers his head when driving to the basket, and is willing to draw [[charge (basketball)|charges]] on defense.<ref name=mysan/> He was even listed by [[ESPN]] writer Thomas Neumann at #6 on the list of greatest [[flop (basketball)|floppers]] in NBA history.<ref>Neumann, Thomas, [http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=neumann/070607 "The greatest floppers in NBA history"], [[7 June]] [[2007]], accessed [[22 June]] [[2007]].</ref> 

But having traversed the major basketball continents in his basketball career, Gin<U+00F3>bili is one of the few players who have enjoyed success under both the physical, one-on-one play of the NBA and the more technical, jumpshooting rule set of the [[FIBA]]. He is the only player in basketball history to win the [[Euroleague]], an [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] gold medal, and an NBA Championship ring.<ref name=inter/><ref name="parati">[http://www.parati.com.ar/nota.php?ID=7584 "Emanuel Ginobili"] - Para T<U+00ED> magazine {{es icon}}</ref> He is also the first non-U.S. player ever to win both the NBA Championship ring and the Olympic gold medal, and only the second [[Latin American]] to be selected to play in an NBA All-Star game (after [[Panama]]'s [[Rolando Blackman]]).<ref name=parati/> In 2007, [[ESPN]] sportswriter [[John Hollinger]] even ranked Gin<U+00F3>bili as the sixth best international player in the NBA, describing the 57th draft pick as the "great heist of all time", and attributed the trend of NBA teams drafting developing European players to the success of the Argentine.<ref name=espn/>
