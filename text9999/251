'''Duncan Edwards''' (1 October 1936 <U+2013> 21 February 1958) was an [[England|English]] [[Association football|footballer]] who played for [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and [[England national football team|the England national team]].  He was one of the [[Busby Babes]], the young United team formed under manager [[Matt Busby]] in the mid 1950s, and one of eight players who died as a result of the [[Munich air disaster]].  

Born in [[Dudley]], Edwards signed for Manchester United as a teenager and went on to become the youngest player to play in the [[Football League First Division]] and the then youngest England player since the [[Second World War]].  In a professional career of less than five years he helped United to win two [[the Football League|Football League]] championships and reach the semi-finals of the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]].  Although he survived the crash of the team's aeroplane at [[Munich]] in February 1958, he died as a result of his injuries 15 days later.

==Biography==
===Early years===
Edwards was born on 1 October 1936 at a house on Malvern Crescent in the [[Woodside, Dudley|Woodside]] district of [[Dudley]],<ref>McCartney, p1</ref> which at the time was part of the county of [[Worcestershire]].<ref name="GeN">{{cite web|url=http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/eng/STS/Boundaries.html#Dudley|title=Staffordshire Boundary Changes|publisher=GENUKI|accessdate=14 February 2008|date=26 March 2001}}</ref>  He was the first child of Gladstone and Sarah Anne Edwards and their only child to survive to adulthood, his younger sister Carol Anne dying in 1947 at the age of 14 weeks.<ref name="Times" />  The family later moved to 31 Elm Road on the [[Priory Estate]], also in Dudley. Edwards attended Priory Primary School from 1941 to 1948, and Wolverhampton Street Secondary School from 1948 to 1952.<ref name="DN" />  He played football for his school as well as for Dudley Schools, Worcestershire and Birmingham and District teams,<ref>McCartney, p4</ref> and also represented his school at [[morris dancing]].<ref name="DN2">{{cite news|url=http://www.dudleynews.co.uk/display.var.2005757.0.your_memories_of_duncan.php|title=Your memories of Duncan|work=Dudley News|accessdate=14 February 2008|date=30 January 2008}}</ref>  He was selected to compete in the National Morris and Sword Dancing Festival, but was also offered a trial for the [[English Schools Football Association]]'s under-14 team, which fell on the same day, and opted to attend the latter.<ref>McCartney, p5</ref>

Edwards impressed the selectors and was chosen to play for the English Schools XI, making his debut against the equivalent team from [[Wales]] at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] on 1 April 1950.  He was soon appointed captain of the team, a position he held for two seasons.<ref name="DT" /><ref name="BN2">{{cite news|url=http://icbirmingham.icnetwork.co.uk/birminghampost/sport/2008/02/08/the-black-country-s-greatest-65233-20454126/|title=Edwards: The Black Country's greatest|work=Birmingham Post|accessdate=14 February 2008|date=8 February 2008}}</ref>  By this stage he had already attracted the attention of major clubs, with [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] scout Jack O'Brien reporting back to manager [[Matt Busby]] in 1948 that he had "today seen a 12-year-old schoolboy who merits special watching. His name is Duncan Edwards, of Dudley".<ref name="DT" />  

[[Joe Mercer]], who was then coaching the England schools team, urged Busby to sign Edwards, who was also attracting interest from [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] and [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]].<ref name="Sandy">{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/enduring-legend-of-indomitable-edwards-671399.html|title=Football: Enduring legend of indomitable Edwards|work=The Independent|accessdate=14 February 2008|date=1 October 2001|first=Brian |last=Viner}}</ref>  Edwards signed for United as an amateur on 2 June 1952,<ref>McCartney, p12</ref> but accounts of when he signed his first professional contract vary.  Some reports state that it occurred on his 17th birthday in October 1953,<ref name="am2">{{cite web|url=http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid={847FFC5F-947A-470D-A13B-E757FD63C2A8}&teamid=1445&bioid=92124|title=Legends: Duncan Edwards|publisher=Manchester United F.C.|accessdate=18 February 2008}}</ref><ref name="book25">McCartney, p25</ref> but others contend that it took place a year earlier.<ref name="DN">{{cite news|url=http://www.dudleynews.co.uk/display.var.2005880.0.0.php|work=Dudley News|title=Duncan Edwards- 50 years on|accessdate=20 February 2008|date=30 January 2008}}</ref><ref name="OneEightThree" />  Those accounts that favour the earlier date usually state that a club official, either Busby himself or coach [[Bert Whalley]], arrived at the Edwards family home soon after midnight to secure the youngster's signature as early as possible, but other reports claim that this occurred when he signed his amateur contract.<ref name="book13">McCartney, p13</ref>  Wolves manager [[Stan Cullis]] was indignant at missing out on a highly touted local youngster and accused United of improperly offering financial inducements to Edwards or his family, but Edwards maintained that he had always wanted to play for the [[Lancashire]] team.<ref>Meek, p100</ref>  To guard against the possibility that he might not make a success of his football career, he also began an apprenticeship as a [[carpenter]].<ref name="book16">McCartney, p16</ref>

===Football career===
Edwards began his Manchester United career in the youth team and made several appearances for the team that won the first ever [[FA Youth Cup]] in 1953,<ref>Horne et al., p225</ref> but by the time of the final had already made his debut for the first team.  On 4 April 1953 he played in a [[Football League First Division]] match against [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]], which United lost 4<U+2013>1,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soccerbase.com/results3.sd?gameid=37293|title=Results/fixtures|publisher=Soccerbase|accessdate=13 February 2008}}</ref> aged just 16 years and 185 days, making him the youngest player ever to play in the top division.<ref name="TBF" />   Mindful of the fact that his team contained a large number of relatively old players, Busby was keen to bring new young players through the ranks, and Edwards, along with the likes of [[Dennis Viollet]] and [[Jackie Blanchflower]], was among a number of youngsters introduced to the team during 1953, who came to be known collectively as the [[Busby Babes]].<ref name="DT" />  Reviewing his performance on his first team debut the ''[[The Guardian|Manchester Guardian]]'' newspaper commented that "he showed promise of fine ability in passing and shooting, but will have to move faster as a wing half".<ref name="book22">McCartney, p22</ref>

The [[1953<U+2013>54 in English football|1953<U+2013>54]] season saw Edwards emerge as a regular in the United first team.<ref name="am2" />  After impressing in a friendly against [[Kilmarnock F.C.|Kilmarnock]] he replaced the injured [[Henry Cockburn (footballer)|Henry Cockburn]] for the away match against [[Huddersfield Town F.C.|Huddersfield Town]] on 31 October 1953,<ref name="book105">McCartney, pp25<U+2013>26</ref> and went on to appear in 24 league matches as well as United's [[FA Cup]] defeat to [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]].<ref name="all" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fchd.info/MANCHESU.HTM|title=Manchester United|publisher=The Football Club History Database|accessdate=19 February 2008}}</ref>  Nonetheless he was also still an active part of the youth team and played in the team which won the Youth Cup for the second consecutive season.<ref name="Times" />  He made his first appearance for the national under-23 team on 20 January 1954 in [[Italy]],<ref name="book30">McCartney, p30</ref>  and was considered for inclusion in the [[England national football team|full England team]], but on the day when the selection committee watched him in action, against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] on 27 March, he gave a poor performance and was not called up.<ref name="book64">McCartney, pp34<U+2013>36</ref>

The following season he made 36 first team appearances and scored his first senior goals, finishing the season with six to his name.<ref name="all" />  His performances revived calls for him to be selected for the senior England team, and a member of the selection committee was despatched to watch him play against [[Huddersfield Town F.C.|Huddersfield Town]] on 18 September 1954, but nothing came of it in the short term,<ref name="book41">McCartney, p41</ref> although he was selected for a Football League XI which played an exhibition match against a [[Scottish League]] team.<ref name="book52">McCartney, p52</ref>  In March he played for [[England B national football team|England B]] against an equivalent team from [[Germany]] and, despite being criticised in the press for his "poor showing",<ref name="book53">McCartney, pp52<U+2013>53</ref> was called up for the full national team a week later.  He made his debut in a match against [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] on 2 April 1955 in the [[British Home Championship]] aged 18 years and 183 days, making him England's youngest debutant since the [[Second World War]], a record which stood until [[Michael Owen]] made his England debut in 1998.<ref name="DT" /><ref name="OneEightThree">{{cite news|url=http://www.expressandstar.com/2008/01/08/duncan-edwards-tribute-exhibition/|title=Duncan Edwards tribute exhibition|work=Express and Star|accessdate=18 February 2008|date=8 January 2008}}</ref>  Three weeks later, United took advantage of the fact that he was still eligible for the youth team to select him for the club's third consecutive FA Youth Cup final.  The decision to field an England international player in the youth team was heavily criticised, and Matt Busby was forced to pen a newspaper article defending Edwards' selection, which paid off for United as the player was instrumental in a third Youth Cup win.<ref name="book567">McCartney, pp56<U+2013>57</ref>  

In May 1955 Edwards was selected for the England squad which travelled to mainland [[Europe]] for matches against [[France national football team|France]], [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] and [[Spain national football team|Spain]], starting all three matches.<ref name="Eng" />  Upon returning from the tour, he began a two-year stint in the [[British Army]] with the [[Royal Army Ordnance Corps]]. Army service was compulsory at the time for all men of his age under the [[National Service]] scheme.<ref>McCartney, p59</ref>  He was stationed at [[Nesscliffe]] near [[Shrewsbury]] along with team-mate [[Bobby Charlton]], but was allowed leave to play for United.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.messengernewspapers.co.uk/news/munich/features/display.var.1992211.0.charlton_remembers_his_lost_team_mates.php|title=Charlton remembers his lost team mates|work=Messenger Newspapers|first=Simon |last=Greenhalgh|accessdate=21 February 2008|date=4 February 2008}}</ref>  He also took part in army matches, and in one season played nearly one hundred matches in total.<ref>Meek, p102</ref>  In the [[1955<U+2013>56 in English football|1955<U+2013>56]] season, despite missing nearly two months of action due to a severe bout of [[influenza]],<ref>McCartney, pp60<U+2013>61</ref> Edwards played 33 times as United won the championship of [[the Football League]] by a margin of 11 points from [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]].<ref name="all" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soccerbase.com/league2.sd?competitionid=5&seasonid=85&x=14&y=14|title=Final 1955/1956 English Division 1 (old) Table|publisher=Soccerbase|accessdate=19 February 2008}}</ref>  The following season he made 34 league appearances, taking his total past the 100 mark, as United won a second consecutive league title,<ref name="all" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soccerbase.com/league2.sd?competitionid=5&seasonid=86&x=14&y=14|title=Final 1956/1957 English Division 1 (old) Table|publisher=Soccerbase|accessdate=19 February 2008}}</ref> and was also in the team that contested the [[1957 FA Cup Final]], in which United missed out on [[the Double]] after a 2<U+2013>1 defeat to [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/broken-dreams-united-and-villa-in-a-game-of-two-eras-767656.html|title=Broken dreams: United and Villa in a game of two eras|work=The Independent|accessdate=19 February 2008|date=2 January 2008}}</ref>  He also made seven appearances during United's first ever foray into the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]],<ref name="all" /> including a 10<U+2013>0 win over [[RSC Anderlecht|Anderlecht]] which remains the club's biggest ever margin of victory.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soccerbase.com/team_records.sd?teamid=1724|title=Manchester United all time records|publisher=Soccerbase|accessdate=21 February 2008|date=23 February 2008}}</ref>  By now he was also a regular in the England team, featuring in all four of England's qualifying matches for the [[1958 FIFA World Cup]] and scoring two goals in the 5<U+2013>2 win over [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]] on 5 December 1956.<ref name="Eng" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tables/58qual.html|title=World Cup 1958 qualifications|publisher=Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation|accessdate=15 September 2010}}</ref>  He was expected to be a key player for England in the World Cup finals, and was seen as a likely candidate to replace the veteran [[Billy Wright (footballer born 1924)|Billy Wright]] as national team captain.<ref name="Inferior" /><ref>{{cite news|url=http://football.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,,2252311,00.html|title=Busby Babes were destined for great things|first=David |last=Meek|work=The Guardian|accessdate=19 February 2008|date=6 February 2008}}</ref>

Edwards began the [[1957<U+2013>58 in English football|1957<U+2013>58]] season in good form and rumours abounded that top [[Italy|Italian]] clubs were seeking to sign him.<ref>McCartney, p105</ref>  His final match in England took place on 1 February 1958, when he scored the opening goal to help United defeat [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] 5<U+2013>4.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/sport/football.html?in_page_id=1779&in_article_id=512384|title=Pat Rice recalls United's last match in Britain before the Munich air disaster of 1958|work=The Daily Mail|accessdate=20 February 2008|date=5 February 2008}}</ref>  The press were critical of his performance, with the Sunday Pictorial's correspondent writing that he did not "think <nowiki>[Edwards']</nowiki> display in this thrilling game would impress England team manager [[Walter Winterbottom]], who was watching.
