With 808 steals in his career, Raines has the fourth-highest total in major league history, behind [[Rickey Henderson]], [[Lou Brock]] and [[Ty Cobb]].<ref>Some sources also place Raines behind [[Billy Hamilton (baseball)|Billy Hamilton]], who recorded over 900 steals from 1888 to 1901; however, nearly 800 of these were achieved prior to 1898, when the definition of a steal was altered, and these early steals are not officially recognized.</ref> His career stolen base percentage (84.7%) is the highest in major league history for players with 300 or more attempts,<ref>Caught stealing data is incomplete prior to the 1951 season.</ref> and he was successful on 40 consecutive steal attempts between July 1993 and August 1995, setting an [[American League]] record at the time (the record was broken by [[Ichiro Suzuki]] in May {{by|2007}}, when he completed 45 consecutive steals).

===Montreal Expos===
The [[Montreal Expos]] selected Raines in the 5th round of the 1977 amateur draft. After debuting with six games as a [[pinch runner]] in {{by|1979}}, he played briefly as a [[second baseman]] for the Expos in {{by|1980}}, but soon switched to playing the outfield, and rapidly became a fan favorite due to his aggressiveness on the basepaths. In his [[1981 Major League Baseball strike|strike]]-interrupted {{by|1981}} rookie season, he batted .304 and stole 71 bases &ndash; then the second most ever by a rookie, behind only [[Benny Kauff]]'s 75 for the {{by|1914}} [[Indianapolis Hoosiers]] in the [[Federal League]]. Raines was caught stealing for the first time in 1981, after having begun his career with a major league record 27 consecutive successful stolen bases. Raines was the runner-up for the NL's [[Rookie of the Year Award]] in 1981, which was won by [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] pitcher [[Fernando Valenzuela]].
