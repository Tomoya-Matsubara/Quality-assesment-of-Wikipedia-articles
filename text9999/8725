"'''End Game'''" is the seventeenth episode of the [[The X-Files (season 2)|second season]] of the American [[science fiction on television|science fiction]] television series ''[[The X-Files]]''. It premiered on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] on {{nowrap|February 17, 1995}}. It was directed by [[Rob Bowman (filmmaker)|Rob Bowman]], and written by [[Frank Spotnitz]]. "End Game" featured guest appearances by [[Megan Leitch]], [[Peter Donat]] and [[Brian Thompson (actor)|Brian Thompson]], saw [[Steven Williams]] reprise his role as [[X (The X-Files)|X]]. The episode is one of those which helped to explore the series' overarching [[Mythology of The X-Files|mythology]]. "End Game" earned a Nielsen household rating of 11.2, being watched by 10.7 million people in its initial broadcast.

After FBI special agent [[Dana Scully]] ([[Gillian Anderson]]) is kidnapped by an alien bounty hunter, her partner [[Fox Mulder]] ([[David Duchovny]]) offers his sister [[Samantha Mulder|Samantha]] (Leitch) forward as a ransom. However, Samantha is merely one of several clones created as part of a human-alien hybrid project, leading Mulder to pursue the bounty hunter for the truth about her disappearance. "End Game" is a two-part episode, continuing the plot from the previous episode, "[[Colony (The X-Files)|Colony]]".

== Plot ==
USS ''Allegiance'', a [[nuclear submarine]] patrolling the [[Beaufort Sea]] off the coast of Alaska, comes across a craft below the ice that is emitting a radio signal. The ''Allegiance'' is ordered to fire upon the craft by [[United States Pacific Command|Pacific Command]]. However, the craft manages to disable the sub, stranding it far below the ice. 

Following on from the cliffhanger ending in "[[Colony (The X-Files)|Colony]]", [[Dana Scully]] ([[Gillian Anderson]]) is beaten and kidnapped by "Mulder", who is really the [[Colonist (The X-Files)#Alien Bounty Hunters|Bounty Hunter]] in disguise. When the real [[Fox Mulder|Mulder]] ([[David Duchovny]]) finds the wrecked hotel room, his sister [[Samantha Mulder|Samantha]] explains that the Bounty Hunter will set up a [[prisoner exchange|hostage exchange]] to swap Scully for her. She further explains that the Bounty Hunter can only be killed by piercing the back of his neck, and that his toxic alien blood is deadly to humans. Finally, Samantha reveals that the Gregors are the progeny of two original aliens, and worked at abortion clinics to gain access to fetal tissue. Their objective was to set up an extraterrestrial colony on Earth, an effort that has gone as far back as the 1940s. However, because the Gregors' experiments were considered to have tainted their alien race, the Bounty Hunter was sent to kill them.

[[Walter Skinner]] meets Mulder and Samantha at his apartment, telling them that the remaining Gregors are missing. Mulder receives a call from Scully, who tells him that the Bounty Hunter seeks an exchange for Samantha. Mulder and Samantha are sent to a bridge near [[Bethesda, Maryland|Bethesda]], while Skinner hides nearby with a sharpshooter. After the exchange takes place, Samantha attacks the Bounty Hunter. During the struggle, the sharpshooter fires upon the Bounty Hunter, and both he and Samantha fall into a river. An anguished Mulder tearfully apologizes to his father, [[List of The X-Files characters#Bill Mulder|Bill]], for losing her again. His father leaves him a note from Samantha, which provides Mulder with the address of a [[Rockville, Maryland]] clinic where they can meet if separated. Mulder hopes that she is alive, but soon gets a call from Scully reporting that Samantha's body has been found. After Scully ends the call, she discovers Samantha's body dissolving into a green liquid.

Meanwhile, upon entering the clinic, Mulder finds multiple clones of Samantha working on fetuses in labs similar to that of the Gregors. They reveal that they manipulated Mulder by sending one of their own to pose as "Samantha" in an effort to have him protect her original clone. They also claim to know the real Samantha's location. Mulder, realizing he has been duped, initially refuses to help and attempts to leave, but is confronted by the arriving Bounty Hunter. The Bounty Hunter knocks Mulder unconscious, proceeding to kill the Samantha clones and burn down the clinic. When no trace of the clones are found, Mulder meets with [[X (The X-Files)|X]] at the [[Kennedy Center]], demanding to know the Bounty Hunter's location. X says that the Bounty Hunter's craft below the Beaufort Sea has been found, and that a naval fleet has been sent to destroy it. Mulder heads there, and e-mails Scully to tell her not to follow him.

Scully goes to Skinner for help, but he initially refuses. Scully also summons X to Mulder's apartment, but he also refuses to provide her with information. On his way out, X is confronted by Skinner in an elevator. After the two men get into a vicious physical altercation, X divulges Mulder's whereabouts. Meanwhile, Mulder finds the stranded ''Allegiance'', with its [[sail (submarine)|sail]] broken through a patch of shallow ice. Inside, he finds that the sub's crew have all been killed. He comes across the apparent sole survivor, whom Mulder correctly guesses to be the disguised Bounty Hunter. Mulder handcuffs him and places him at gunpoint, demanding to know where Samantha is. The two get into a struggle, during which Mulder becomes exposed to the Bounty Hunter's blood. The Bounty Hunter claims that Samantha is still alive before dumping Mulder off the sail. He then submerges the ''Allegiance'', nearly cutting Mulder in half with the sub's [[diving plane]] in the process. Mulder is rushed to the [[field hospital]] seen at the beginning of "Colony", where Scully<U+2014>having learned that the alien blood contains a [[retrovirus]] that dies in cold temperatures <U+2014> convinces the doctors to keep him in an ice tub, saving his life.

As Mulder's condition stabilizes, Scully writes a field report crediting science with detecting the retrovirus and saving Mulder's life. She contends that the retrovirus is of a mysterious origin, and reports that neither the Bounty Hunter nor the ''Allegiance'' have been found. When Mulder gains consciousness, he tells Scully that his experiences did not give him the answers he had been searching for, but that they have given him renewed "faith to keep looking".<ref name="plot1">Lowry, pp.202<U+2013>204</ref><ref name="plot2">Lovece, pp.154<U+2013>156</ref>

== Production ==
=== Writing ===
This was the first episode ever written by [[Frank Spotnitz]].<ref name="Commentary">{{cite video |people=[[Frank Spotnitz]] (narrator) |date=2005 |title=Audio Commentary for "End Game" |medium= DVD |publisher=[[20th Century Fox Home Entertainment|Fox]] |work=[[The X-Files Mythology, Volume 1 <U+2013> Abduction]]}}</ref> Spotnitz, who came up with the idea to bring back Samantha Mulder in "Colony", wrote this episode, his first credited work on the show.<ref name="prod1" /> According to Spotnitz, he along with [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]], were overly ambitious when writing this episode.<ref name="Commentary" /> Since this was Spotnitz's debut as a television writer, he got significant help from Carter to put the script together.<ref name="Commentary" /> All of the scenes originally pitched by Spotnitz were kept with the exception of a [[car chase]] scene that ended with a crash, and one in which Mulder mistakes a [[United States Marshals Service|federal marshal]] for the bounty hunter. The scenes were cut due to time restraints during filming.<ref name="prod1">Edwards, p.117<U+2013>118</ref>

It turned out in this episode that the [[Samantha Mulder]] ([[Megan Leitch]]) who appeared was a clone.<ref name="Commentary"/> Carter did not want it to be the real Samantha since that would have been "straight [[science fiction]]" and it was too "ridiculous" to give too many answers.<ref name="Commentary"/> Spotnitz further explained that the production crew never saw ''The X-Files'' as a "science fiction show", but more of a show that incorporated science fiction and that this and previous episode "[[Colony (The X-Files)|Colony]]" were more of a "suspense thriller" than any other genre.<ref name="Commentary"/>

=== Filming ===
Chris Carter described the "Colony" and "End Game" two-parter as the "backbone of the show, the romantic quest of Mulder for the truth and Scully as well", and that it led Scully to believe in the conspiracy.<ref name=dvdint/>

The motel scene with the bounty hunter and Dana Scully was shot on a [[sound stage]] in [[Vancouver, Canada]] in a simple motel room set. The scene featuring Scully being beaten up by the bounty hunter was not acted by Anderson, but a stunt woman.<ref name="Commentary"/> The stiletto weapon, often referred to as the "[[gimlet (tool)|gimlet]]", used by the bounty hunter was constructed from aluminium and acrylic, and activated by a pneumatic hose hidden in actor Brian Thompson's sleeve.<ref name="prod2"/> The grunt Scully utters when pushed to the ground was insisted on by [[Standards and Practices]], giving the reasoning that the show needed to make it clear for the viewers that she was not dead. According to executive producer [[Frank Spotnitz]] it was an "arcane, bizarre logic that you have to deal with when you're putting a show on network television."<ref name="Commentary"/> As director Rob Bowman got dissatisfied with the first take of Skinner pushing X against the elevator, Mitch Pileggi and Steven Williams decided to do the stunt for real, and Pileggi did it with so much strength that it broke the back of the elevator scenery.<ref>{{cite video|title=The Truth About Season Two|work=[[The X-Files (season 2)|The X-Files: The Complete Second Season]] |titleyear=1994<U+2013>1995 |people=Chris Carter |format=featurette|publisher=[[Fox Broadcasting Corporation|Fox]]}}</ref> Williams' background in [[Stage combat|fight choreography]], stemming from his role in ''[[Missing in Action 2: The Beginning]]'', allowed him to help in choreographing the brawl.<ref>Lowry, p.77</ref>

One hundred and forty tons of snow and ice were trucked into a soundstage in order to create the scene with the submarine towards the end of the episode,<ref name="prod2">Lowry, p.204</ref> and said stage had to be refrigerated for five days. The control tower scenery was able to rise or lower only five feet, leading to restrictions such as filming on black backdrops.<ref name=dvdint>{{cite video|title=Chris Carter Talks About Season 2: "End Game"|work=[[The X-Files (season 2)|The X-Files: The Complete Second Season]] |titleyear=1994<U+2013>1995 |people=[[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] (narrator) |format=featurette|publisher=[[Fox Broadcasting Corporation|Fox]]}}</ref> A decommissioned submarine, [[Her Majesty's Canadian Ship]] Mackenzie, was rented from the [[Royal Canadian Navy]] and used for the submarine interior.

==Reception==

{{quote box|width=30em|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|...the sad paradox of Mulder's quest is that you can't want to believe ''and'' trust no one. He's angry when he discovers the multiple Samanthas, and realizes he'd been conned, and he claims he'll wash his hands of the whole scene, but we know it's a lie. In the end, despite near death, despite all the set-backs, he still has the faith to go on searching. He believes, he'll follow any lie no matter how outlandish, because maybe, just maybe, he might find that final thread that will give his life meaning. And we watch, hoping the same might be true for ourselves.|source=<U+2014>[[The A.V. Club]]'s Zack Handlen on the Mulder's quest for the truth.<ref name="AVC"/>}}
