The {{nihongo|'''''Fuji'' class'''|<U+5BCC><U+58EB><U+578B><U+6226><U+8266>|Fuji-gata senkan}} was a two-ship [[ship class|class]] of [[pre-dreadnought battleship]]s built for the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] (IJN) in the mid-1890s. They were the first battleships in the IJN, and were constructed in the UK as Japan lacked the industrial facilities needed to build them. Their design was based on the battleships being built for the [[Royal Navy]] at that time.

The ships participated in the [[Russo-Japanese War]] of 1904<U+2013>1905, including the [[Battle of Port Arthur]] in February 1904 and two bombardments of [[L<U+00FC>shunkou District|Port Arthur]] during the following month. [[Japanese battleship Yashima|''Yashima'']] struck a [[naval mine|mine]] off Port Arthur in May and [[capsized]] while under tow several hours later. [[Japanese battleship Fuji|''Fuji'']] fought in the Battles of the [[Battle of the Yellow Sea|Yellow Sea]] and [[Battle of Tsushima|Tsushima]] and was lightly damaged in the latter action. She was reclassified as a [[coastal defence ship]] in 1910 and served as a [[training ship]] for the rest of her active career. The ship was [[Hulk (ship)|hulk]]ed in 1922 and converted into a [[barracks ship]] fitted with classrooms. ''Fuji'' was finally [[ship breaking|broken up]] for scrap in 1948.

==Background==
In the late 19th century, the strategy of the Imperial Japanese Navy was based on the radical [[Jeune Ecole]] naval philosophy, as promoted by French [[military advisor]] and [[naval architect]] [[Emile Bertin]]. This emphasised cheap [[torpedo boat]]s and commerce raiding to offset expensive, heavily armoured ships. The acquisition of two German-built {{sclass-|Dingyuan|ironclad}}s by the [[Qing dynasty|Imperial Chinese]] [[Beiyang Fleet]] in 1885 threatened Japan's interests in Korea. A visit by the Chinese warships to Japan in early 1891 forced the Japanese government to acknowledge that the IJN required similarly armed and armoured ships of its own to counter the ironclads; the three lightly armoured {{sclass-|Matsushima|cruiser}}s ordered from France would not suffice, despite their powerful guns. The IJN decided to order a pair of the latest battleships from the United Kingdom<ref>Evans & Peattie, pp. 15, 19<U+2013>20, 60</ref> as Japan lacked the technology and capability to construct its own battleships.<ref name=b3/>

Obtaining funding for the battleships was a struggle for the Japanese government. The initial request was submitted in the budget of [[Prime Minister of Japan|Prime Minister]] [[Matsukata Masayoshi]] in 1891, but was deleted by the [[Diet of Japan]] due to political infighting. Matsukata submitted the request again and, when again denied, was forced to dissolve his [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]]. His successor, Prime Minister [[It<U+014D> Hirobumi]], attempted to pass the funding measure in 1892, but he also failed. This led to an extraordinary personal intervention by [[Emperor Meiji]] in a statement dated 10 February 1893, wherein the emperor offered to fund the construction of the two battleships himself, through an annual reduction in the expenses of the [[Imperial Household Agency|Imperial Household]], and asked that all government officials likewise agree to a reduction in their salaries by ten percent. The funding measure for the ''Fuji''-class battleships was passed by the Japanese Diet soon after. Completion of the ships was originally scheduled for 1899, but the start of the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] shortly before they were [[keel laying|laid down]] in 1894 caused the government to accelerate the schedule by two years.<ref>Lengerer 2008, pp. 7<U+2013>10</ref>

==Design and description==
[[File:Fuji class battleship diagrams Brasseys 1896.jpg|thumb|left|300px|<center>Right elevation and deck plan as depicted in ''[[Brassey's Naval Annual]]'' 1896</center>]]
The design of the ''Fuji'' class was derived from that of the British {{sclass-|Royal Sovereign|battleship|2}}s, albeit about {{convert|2000|LT|t}} smaller. The ''Fuji''-class ships improved on the ''Royal Sovereign''s in several ways; they were about {{convert|1|kn|lk=in}} faster, they incorporated superior [[Harvey armour]], and their guns, although smaller and lighter, were the same as those of the later {{sclass-|Majestic|battleship|0}} and were protected by armoured hoods ([[gun turret]]s). The two ships of the class were almost identical even though they were designed by two different naval architects, ''Yashima'' by [[Philip Watts (naval architect)|Philip Watts]] and ''Fuji'' by [[George C. Mackrow]]. The primary difference was that ''Yashima'' had her [[deadwood (shipbuilding)|deadwood]] cut away aft and was fitted with a [[balanced rudder]]. This made her almost a knot faster than her [[sister ship|sister]] and gave her a smaller turning circle at the cost of a weaker [[stern]] that required careful attention when [[drydock]]ed lest it sag.<ref name=b3>Brook, 1999, p. 123</ref>

The ''Fuji''-class ships had an [[length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|412|ft|m|1}}, a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|73.25|-|73.75|ft|m|1}}, and a normal [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|26.25|-|26.5|ft|m|1}}. They displaced {{convert|12230|-|12533|LT|t|lk=in}} at normal load.<ref name=j6/> The ships had [[double bottom]]s and were subdivided into a total of 181 [[watertight compartment]]s.<ref>Lengerer 2009, p. 26</ref> The crew numbered about 650 officers and enlisted men.<ref name=b2/> ''Yashima'' was fitted as a [[flagship]] with accommodation for an admiral and his staff.<ref>Lengerer 2009, p. 51</ref>

===Propulsion===
The ''Fuji''-class ships were powered by two [[Humphrys, Tennant and Dykes|Humphrys Tennant]] 3-cylinder [[Marine steam engine#Triple or multiple expansion|vertical triple-expansion steam engines]], each driving one {{convert|5.18|m|ft|disp=flip|adj=on|0}} propeller, using steam generated by ten cylindrical [[boiler (steam generator)|boiler]]s with a working pressure of {{convert|10.898|kg/cm2|kPa psi|0|abbr=on|lk=on}}.<ref name=l23>Lengerer 2008, p. 23</ref> The engines were rated at {{convert|13500|ihp|lk=in}}, using [[forced draught]], and designed to reach a top speed of {{convert|18.25|kn}}<ref name=b2>Brook 1999, p. 122</ref> although the ships proved to be faster during their [[sea trial]]s, reaching top speeds of {{convert|18.66|to|19.46|kn}}.<ref>Lengerer 2008, p. 27</ref> A watertight centreline [[bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]] separated the two engine rooms as well as the four [[Fire room|boiler rooms]]. The boiler rooms were further separated by a transverse bulkhead. Unlike both the ''Royal Sovereign''s and ''Majestic''s, the ''Fuji'' class had their [[funnel (ship)|funnel]]s on the centreline.<ref>Lengerer 2008, p. 24</ref>

The ships carried a maximum of {{convert|1620|t|LT}}<ref name=b2/> of coal which allowed them to steam for {{convert|4000|lk=in|nmi}} at a speed of {{convert|10|kn}}.<ref name=j6>Jentschura, Jung & Mickel, p. 16</ref>{{#tag:ref|Lengerer give coal storage figures of {{convert|1110|to|1117|LT|t}} that gave them ranges of {{convert|7000|nmi|abbr=on}} at 10 knots.<ref>Lengerer 2008, pp. 11, 23</ref>|group=Note}} They were fitted with three electric [[dynamo]]s, each rated at {{convert|32|kW|lk=in}}.<ref>Lengerer 2009, p. 50</ref>

===Armament===
[[File:Fuji class 12 inch gun turret right elevation.jpg|thumb|left|<center>12-inch gun turret arrangement</center>]]
The [[main battery]] of the ''Fuji'' class consisted of four hydraulically operated [[Armstrong Whitworth|Elswick Ordnance Company]] 40-[[caliber (artillery)|calibre]] [[Armstrong Whitworth 12 inch naval gun|Type 41 twelve-inch guns]] mounted in pear-shaped twin-gun [[barbette]]s fore and aft of the superstructure. The barbettes had a firing arc of 240<U+00B0> and the guns had a maximum elevation of +15<U+00B0> and could depress to <U+2212>5<U+00B0>.<ref>Lengerer 2009, pp. 27, 36</ref> These barbettes had armoured hoods, or turrets, to protect the guns. The mountings were virtually identical to those of those used in the first ''Majestic''-class battleships, which could only hoist ammunition from the below-decks [[magazine (artillery)|magazine]]s in one position. However, 18 shells were stowed in each turret that allowed a limited amount of firing at any angle before their ammunition supply needed to be replenished. The guns were loaded at a fixed angle of 1<U+00B0><ref name=b3/> and fired {{convert|850|lb|kg|adj=on|0}} projectiles at a [[muzzle velocity]] of {{convert|2400|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}.<ref>Friedman, pp. 270<U+2013>71</ref> This gave them an approximate range of {{convert|15000|m|yd|disp=flip}}.<ref name=l30>Lengerer 2009, p. 30</ref>

[[Battleship secondary armament|Secondary armament]] of the ''Fuji'' class consisted of ten 40-calibre [[Type 41 6-inch (152 mm)/40-caliber naval gun|Type 41 six-inch]] [[British ordnance terms#QF|quick-firing guns]],<ref name=j6/> four on the main deck in [[casemate]]s and six guns on the upper deck protected by [[gun shield]]s.<ref>Brook 1985, pp. 268<U+2013>69</ref> They fired {{convert|100|lb|kg|adj=on|0}} shells at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|2300|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}.<ref>Friedman, pp. 275<U+2013>76</ref> Protection from torpedo boat attacks was provided by fourteen {{convert|47|mm|adj=on}} [[QF 3-pounder Hotchkiss|three-pounder Hotchkiss guns]] and ten 47-millimetre 2.5-pounder [[Hotchkiss gun]]s.<ref name=b2/>{{#tag:ref|Sources differ significantly on the exact outfit of light guns. Naval historians Roger Chesneau and Eugene Kolesnik and Hans Lengerer cite twenty 3- and four 2.5-pounders.<ref name=l23/><ref>Chesneau & Kolesnik, p. 220</ref> Jentschura, Jung & Mickel give a total of twenty-four 47&nbsp;mm guns, without dividing them between the 3 and 2.5-pounders,<ref name=j6/> while Silverstone says that they had only twenty 47&nbsp;mm guns, again without discriminating between the two types.<ref>Silverstone, p. 309</ref>|group=Note}} The three-pounder gun fired {{convert|3.2|lb|kg|adj=on}} projectiles at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|1927|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} while the 2.5-pounder fired {{convert|2.5|lb|kg|adj=on}} shells at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|1420|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}.<ref>Friedman, pp. 118<U+2013>19</ref> The ships were also equipped with five [[British 18 inch torpedo|18-inch]] [[torpedo tube]]s, one in the bow above water and four submerged tubes, two on each [[broadside]].<ref name=b2/>

In 1901, both ships exchanged 16 of their 47&nbsp;mm guns for an equal number of [[QF 12-pounder 12 cwt naval gun|QF 12-pounder 12 cwt]]<ref group=Note>"Cwt" is the abbreviation for [[hundredweight]], 12 cwt referring to the weight of the gun.</ref> guns.<ref name=j6/> They fired {{convert|3|in|adj=on|0}}, {{convert|12.5|lb|adj=on}} projectiles at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|2359|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}.<ref>Friedman, p. 114</ref> This raised the number of crewmen to 652 and later to 741.<ref name=j6/>

===Armour===
The armour scheme of the ''Fuji''-class ships was similar to that used by the ''Royal Sovereign''s except that the Japanese ships used superior Harvey armour of the same thickness instead of [[compound armour]]. The [[waterline]] [[armor belt|main belt]] was {{convert|8|ft|m|1}} high, {{convert|3|ft|m|1}} of which was above the waterline at normal load, and had a maximum thickness of {{convert|18|in|mm|0}}. It reduced to {{convert|16|in|mm|0}} then {{convert|14|in|mm|0}} at the ends past the two barbettes; above it was a {{convert|4|in|mm|0|adj=on}} [[strake]] of armour that ran between the barbettes. They were 14 inches thick outside the upper armour belt and reduced to {{convert|9|in|mm|0}} behind the upper belt. Diagonal bulkheads connected the barbettes to the side armour; the forward bulkhead was 14 inches thick while the rear bulkhead was {{convert|12|in|mm|0}} thick. The armour of the casemates and the barbette hoods had a maximum thickness of 6 inches while the [[conning tower]] was protected by 14 inches of armour. The [[Deck (ship)|deck]] armour was {{convert|2.5|in|mm|0}} thick and met the sides of the ship at the top of the main armour belt.<ref name=j6/><ref name=b2/>

Both ships had reached Japan by February 1898.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/71283113?searchTerm=battleship%20fuji&searchLimits=|title=The Chinese Question|work=Australian Town and Country Journal|pages=31|accessdate=29 July 2012|location=Sydney, Australia}}</ref>
At the start of the Russo-Japanese War in 1904, ''Fuji'' and ''Yashima'' were assigned to the 1st Division of the [[1st Fleet (Imperial Japanese Navy)|1st Fleet]]. They participated in the Battle of Port Arthur on 9 February, when Admiral [[T<U+014D>g<U+014D> Heihachir<U+014D>]] led the 1st Fleet in an attack on the Russian ships of the [[Pacific Fleet (Russia)|Pacific Squadron]] anchored just outside Port Arthur. T<U+014D>g<U+014D> chose to attack the Russian coastal defences with his main armament and engage the Russian ships with his secondary guns. Splitting his fire proved to be a poor decision as his {{convert|8|in|0|adj=on|spell=in}} and six-inch guns inflicted very little damage on the Russian vessels, which concentrated all their fire on the Japanese ships. ''Yashima'' was not struck during the battle, but ''Fuji'' was hit twice, two men being killed and 10 wounded.<ref>Forczyk, pp. 41<U+2013>44</ref>

[[File:Battleship Yashima.jpg|left|upright|thumb|Model of ''Yashima'' with her [[torpedo nets]] deployed, [[National Maritime Museum]], London]]
On 10 March, the two ships blindly bombarded the harbour of Port Arthur from Pigeon Bay, on the southwest side of the [[Liaodong Peninsula]], at a range of {{convert|9.5|km}}, but did little damage.<ref>Brook 1985, p. 269</ref> When they tried again on 22 March, they were attacked by Russian coastal defence guns that had been transferred there, and also from several Russian ships in Port Arthur using observers overlooking Pigeon Bay. The Japanese ships disengaged after ''Fuji'' was hit by a 12-inch shell.<ref name=f4>Forczyk, p. 44</ref>

''Fuji'' and ''Yashima'' participated in the action of 13 April when T<U+014D>g<U+014D> successfully lured out two battleships of the Pacific Squadron. When the Russians spotted the five battleships of the 1st Division, they turned back for Port Arthur and the battleship {{ship|Russian battleship|Petropavlovsk|1897|2}} struck a minefield laid by the Japanese the previous night. The ship sank in less than two minutes after one of her magazines exploded. Emboldened by his success, T<U+014D>g<U+014D> resumed long-range bombardment missions, which prompted the Russians to lay more minefields.<ref>Forczyk, pp. 45<U+2013>46</ref>

On 14 May 1904, the battleships [[Japanese battleship Hatsuse|''Hatsuse'']], {{ship|Japanese battleship|Shikishima||2}}, and ''Yashima'', the [[protected cruiser]] [[Japanese cruiser Kasagi|''Kasagi'']], and the [[dispatch boat]] {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Tatsuta|1894|2}} put to sea to relieve the Japanese blockading force off Port Arthur.<ref>Warner & Warner, p. 279</ref> The following morning, the squadron encountered a Russian minefield. ''Hatsuse'' struck one mine that disabled her steering and ''Yashima'' struck two others when moving to assist ''Hatsuse''.<ref name=l14/> ''Yashima'' was towed away from the minefield, but she was still taking on water at an uncontrollable rate and the crew abandoned ship some five hours later. ''Kasagi'' took ''Yashima'' in tow, but the battleship's [[list (watercraft)|list]] continued to increase and she capsized about three hours later.<ref>Warner & Warner, pp. 279<U+2013>82</ref>

[[File:IJN Fuji 2.jpg|thumb|A postcard of ''Fuji'' in 1905]]
During the Battle of the Yellow Sea in August 1904, ''Fuji'' was not damaged because the Russian ships concentrated their fire on T<U+014D>g<U+014D>'s flagship, the battleship {{ship|Japanese battleship|Mikasa||2}}, which was leading the column.<ref>Forczyk, pp. 52<U+2013>53</ref> In May the following year, during the Battle of Tsushima, ''Fuji'' was hit a dozen times, the most serious of which penetrated the hood of the rear barbette, ignited some exposed propellant charges, killed eight men and wounded nine. After the ammunition fire was put out, the left gun in the barbette resumed firing and apparently delivered the ''[[coup de gr<U+00E2>ce]]'' that sank the battleship {{ship|Russian battleship|Borodino||2}}.<ref>Campbell, p. 263</ref>

On 23 October 1908, ''Fuji'' hosted a dinner for the American Ambassador, [[Thomas J. O'Brien (Michigan politician)|Thomas J. O'Brien]], and the senior officers of the [[Great White Fleet]] during its circumnavigation of the world.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9B01E1DC1739E333A25757C2A9669D946997D6CF&scp=8&sq=battleship+and+fuji&st=p|title=Tokio Enthusiasts Nearly Mob Sperry|date=24 October 1908|work=New York Times|accessdate=29 July 2012}}</ref> In 1910, her cylindrical boilers were replaced by Miyabara [[water-tube boiler]]s and her main armament was replaced by Japanese-built guns. ''Fuji'' was reclassified as a first-class [[coast defence ship]] the same year, and undertook training duties in various capacities until disarmed in 1922. Her hulk continued to be used as a floating [[barracks]] and training centre at Yokosuka until 1945.<ref>Jentschura, Jung & Mickel, pp. 16<U+2013>17</ref> ''Fuji'' was damaged by American carrier aircraft during their 18 July 1945 [[attack on Yokosuka]]<ref>Tully</ref> and capsized after the end of the war.<ref>Fukui, p. 54</ref> The ship was scrapped in 1948.<ref name=j7/>
