'''Gary Schiff''' (born February 3, 1972) is a member of the [[Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party]] and a representative of Ward 9 on the [[Minneapolis City Council]]. He was elected in 2001 and re-elected in 2005 and 2009. Schiff announced in January 2013 that he would be a candidate for mayor in the [[2013 Minneapolis mayoral election]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mndaily.com/2013/01/29/schiff-joins-race-minneapolis-mayor|newspaper=Minnesota Daily|title=Schiff joins race for Minneapolis mayor|date=January 29, 2013|accessdate=January 29, 2013|first=Brian|last=Arola}}</ref>

==Early life==

In 1990, the American Civil Liberties Union represented Gary Schiff after he graduated from [[Lewiston-Porter Central School District#High school|Lewiston-Porter High School]]. According to ''[[The Buffalo News]]'', Schiff had painted a mural along the school's stairwell that referenced "drugs, safe sex, AIDS and racism" in the style of artist [[Keith Haring]].<ref name=mural>{{cite news|last=Graves|first=Neil|title=Forum Airs Issues in Mural Flap: Ultimate Resolution May Rest With Court|newspaper=Buffalo News|date=September 14, 1990}}</ref> In September of that year, the school's superintendent, Walter S. Polka, decided that parts of the mural's text was objectionable.<ref name=mural/> The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] became involved in an extended legal fight over the constitutionality of Polka's censorship, and a New York Supreme Court Justice sided with the Lewiston-Porter School Board.<ref>{{cite news|last=Baldwin|first=Richard E.|title=Costs in Mural Dispute Total $24,664: School Board Gets Report on Lew-Port's Legal Fees|newspaper=Buffalo News|date=July 17, 1991}}</ref> In 1991, the school board voted 5-1 to paint over the mural. The board cited Schiff's involvement in a recent [[ACT-UP]] demonstration at the school<U+2014>where demonstrators gave condoms and safe sex literature to students<U+2014>as a major influence on their decision.<ref>{{cite news|last=Chrzanowski|first=Ed|title=Lew-Port Board Votes to Paint Out Disputed Mural: Artist's  Participation in ACT-UP is Factor|newspaper=Buffalo News|date=July 17, 1991}}</ref>  

In October 1992, after Schiff moved to [[Minneapolis]] to attend the [[University of Minnesota]], he and six other students protested against the [[Reserve Officers' Training Corps]] (ROTC) and its compliance with a longstanding ban on homosexuals in the military. The seven protesters interrupted a meeting of the University Board of Regents, demanded the expulsion of the ROTC from campus, and handcuffed themselves to the Regents' chairs. Wearing signs that read "$old," suggesting that their human rights had been traded for Federal grant money, Schiff and the six other students were arrested by University Police and each charged with misdemeanors.<ref>{{cite news|last=Pinney|first=Gregor W.|title=Seven Students Arrested Protesting ROTC Policy at 'U' Regents Meeting|newspaper=Star Tribune|date=October 10, 1992}}</ref>    

From 1993 to 1995, Schiff directed the Progressive Student Leadership Exchange (PLSE), a program modeled on the [[Civil Rights Movement]]'s [[Freedom Summer]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Vaid|first=Urvashi|title=Virtual Equality: The Mainstreaming of Gay and Lesbian Liberation|year=1993|publisher=Anchor Books|location=New York|isbn=0385472994|pages=399<U+2013>400}}</ref> The PLSE brought young activists and students to assist with LGBT rights campaigns in Missouri, Maine, and other states.<ref>{{cite web|last=Greenman|first=Jessica|title=Youth Jobs!|publisher=Email forwarded from Gary Schiff (April 11, 1995)|accessdate=November 13, 2012}}</ref>   The [[Human Rights Campaign]] (HRC) took interest in the program, and invited Schiff to direct it as the newly-named "Youth College for Campaign Training"  in Washington, D.C.<ref>{{cite web|title=HRC Launches First Youth College for Campaign Training|url=https://groups.google.com/group/bit.listserv.gaynet/tree/browse_frm/month/1996-03/b65654372545add4?rnum=101&_done=/group/bit.listserv.gaynet/browse_frm/month/1996-03?&pli=1|publisher=Human Rights Campaign|date=February 29, 1996|accessdate=November 12, 2012}}</ref> The HRC-funded program invited people aged 18<U+2013>24 to participate in workshops, and sent the participants to "target states" where they worked in groups as campaign staff members. The program was still in operation as late as 2006.<ref>{{cite web|last=Corner|first=Matt|title=HRC Youth College for Campaign Training; Applications Accepted|url=interstateq.com/archives/696/|publisher=Interstate Q |date= March 8, 2006|accessdate=November 12, 2012}}</ref>  

After graduation, Schiff moved to [[Washington, D.C.]] to work with the [[Human Rights Campaign]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Roper|first=''Ibid''}}{{full|date=January 2013}}<!-- which one? Roper not cited above --></ref> He returned to Minneapolis to work with Progressive Minnesota, "a grassroots group focused on community organizing and electoral politics."<ref>{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions: When, and why, was TakeAction Minnesota formed?|url=http://www.takeactionminnesota.org/frequently_asked_questions/44|publisher=Take Action Minnesota|accessdate=June 24, 2012}}</ref> In December 1997, he became involved in a fight to save the Shubert Theater, a former vaudeville house on "[[Block E (Minneapolis)|Block E]]" in downtown Minneapolis, after the Minneapolis City Council approved a redevelopment plan that called for the theater's demolition.<ref>{{cite news|last=Mack|first=Linda|title=The Shubert's Next Act: A Stroll Down Hennepin?|newspaper= Star Tribune|date=December 19, 1997|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-62621133.html}}</ref> Within days, Schiff organized "Save Our Shubert," a grassroots effort to preserve the theater.<ref>{{cite news|last=Peck|first=Claude|title=Moving the Shubert Seen as Possible but Pricey|newspaper= Star Tribune|date=December 19, 1997|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-62621198.html}}</ref> After eight months, the Minneapolis City Council voted 9-3 to move the theater to a space adjacent to the [[Hennepin Center for the Arts]] at a cost of $3.9 million.<ref>{{cite news|last=Brandt|first=Steve|title=Shubert to take its show on the road|newspaper= Star Tribune|date=August 22, 1998|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-62564897.html}}</ref> The theater reopened as the [[Cowles Center for Dance and the Performing Arts]] in September 2011 and hosted 110 performances in its first season.<ref>{{cite news|last=Preston|first=Rohan|title=A year of dance at the Cowles: Now that its First Season is Completed, the New-old Theater in Downtown Minneapolis Reveals Successes and Challenges|newspaper= Star Tribune|date=July 1, 2012|url=http://www.startribune.com/entertainment/stageandarts/160837225.html}}</ref>

==Minneapolis City Council==

Schiff took a leave of absence from the University of Minnesota's [[Hubert H. Humphrey School of Public Affairs]] to run for a seat on the Minneapolis City Council against Michael Guest and Kathy Thurber.<ref>{{cite news|last=Olson|first=Rochelle|title=Thurber Won't Seek Reelection to Minneapolis City Council|newspaper= Star Tribune|date=February 9, 2001}}</ref> He won unanimous DFL endorsement on September 11, 2001 and, in a race that was overshadowed by the [[2001 terrorist attacks]], he ran against Lucky Rosenbloom, an African-American Republican.<ref name=stribed2001>{{cite news|last=''Star Tribune'' editorial staff|title=Minneapolis City Council|newspaper= Star Tribune|date=October 21, 2001}}</ref> Schiff received the endorsement of the ''[[Star Tribune|Minneapolis Star Tribune]]'', which noted his "first-hand knowledge" of [[light rail]] systems in other U.S. cities.<ref name=stribed2001/> Elected by a large majority in November 2001, Schiff became one of seven newly-elected members on the 13-member city council, joining two [[Green Party of Minnesota|Green Party]] members, two other openly gay council members, one African-American council member, and four women.<ref>{{cite news|last=Brunswick|first=Mark|title=Minneapolis City Council|newspaper= Star Tribune|date=November 7, 2001}}</ref>

===First term (2001-2005)===

In his first term, Schiff sponsored numerous legal reforms to the Minneapolis Zoning Code that reduced bureaucratic obstacles for small businesses and housing developers, including a measure that permitted sidewalk cafes to use permanent outdoor furniture<ref>{{cite news|last=Nelson|first=Rick|title=Proposal Would Prettify City's Sidewalk Cafes|newspaper= Star Tribune|date=June 28, 2002}}</ref>  and a change in city zoning code that facilitated the construction of denser and more affordable housing.<ref>{{cite news|title=Minneapolis City Council:  Bonuses to Boost Housing Approved, Higher Density, More Low-Cost Units Sought|newspaper= Star Tribune|date=November 23, 2002|first=Kevin |last2=Duchscher|first2=Rochelle|last2= Olson}}</ref>   He also sponsored ordinances that reduced the requirements of the Minneapolis Truth of Sale in Housing Program<ref>{{cite news|last=Olson|first=Rochelle|title=Home Inspection Rules Loosened|newspaper= Star Tribune|date=May 4, 2002}}</ref>   and added domestic partnerships to the Zoning Code's definition of "family" in terms of housing.<ref>{{cite web|title=Meeting Minutes|url=http://www.minneapolismn.gov/meetings/council/2002-meetings_20021213_council20021213actions|publisher=Minneapolis City Council (December 13, 2002)|accessdate=November 13, 2012}}</ref> 

In 2003, with colleagues Barbara Johnson and Sandy Colvin Ray, Schiff developed a last-minute plan to restore $2 million in proposed cuts to the Minneapolis Fire and Police Departments, following a $26 million cut from Local Government Aid by former Governor Tim Pawlenty.<ref>{{cite news|last=Olson|first=Rochelle|title=Some Fire, Police Jobs Spared: In Adjusting and Approving Budget Cuts, the Minneapolis City Council Finds a Way to Save Positions|newspaper= Star Tribune|date=March 4, 2003}}</ref>   That same year, he sponsored an ordinance that effectively blocked police officers, city inspectors, and other city employees from inquiring about a resident's immigration status. The ordinance forbids police officers from arresting a suspect solely on the grounds of a suspected immigration status violation.<ref>{{cite news|last=Brandt|first=Steve|title=Minneapolis OKs Rule on Immigrants: City Employees are Now Limited in What They Can Do to Turn People in for Possible Immigration Violations|newspaper= Star Tribune|date=July 12, 2003}}</ref>  

===Second term (2005<U+2013>2009)===

In July 2004, the Minneapolis City Council passed a ban on indoor smoking in bars, restaurants, pool halls, and bowling alleys by a 12-1 margin.<ref>{{cite news|last=Scheck|first=Tom|title=Minneapolis City Council Passes Smoking Ban|newspaper= Star Tribune|date=July 23, 2004}}</ref>    In March 2005, the ban took effect alongside other indoor smoking bans passed by other cities in the [[Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area]].<ref name=Stellar>{{cite news|last=Stellar|first=Chris|title=Ward Nine: Schiff, Bicking Vie Again|newspaper=Minnesota Independent|date=September 7, 2009}}</ref>    Subsequently, during the 2005 Minneapolis City Council elections, a write-in candidate named Dave Shegstad received 10 percent of the ninth ward vote under a "Smoke Out Gary" campaign slogan<U+2014>a reference to Schiff's role as a co-author of the smoking ban.  59 percent of voters re-elected Schiff to a second term; his main opponent, Green Party candidate David Bicking, won 30 percent of the vote.<ref name=Stellar/>   

In 2006, Schiff sponsored eliminating a cap on taxi licenses in Minneapolis. The move angered some local taxi  drivers, who noted that an attending increase in licenses would lead to greater competition in the local taxicab business.<ref>{{cite news|last=Giles|first=Kevin|title=Hailing, Howling Follow New Cab Rules: Everyone Agrees that Minneapolis' New Taxi Ordinance Will Mean Changes|newspaper= Star Tribune|date=October 10, 2006}}</ref>   The City Council passed the cap lift, and the number of Minneapolis taxis doubled between 2010 and 2012.<ref>{{cite news|last=Roper|first=Eric|title=A Bumper-to-Bumper Crop of Cabs|newspaper= Star Tribune|date=May 9, 2012}}</ref>   

Beginning in 2008, Schiff and other city leaders contended with local ramifications of the [[2008-2012 global recession]], which included spate of foreclosures in economically distressed neighborhoods. In April 2008, the city council approved a pilot mortgage assistance program called Minneapolis Advantage. The program, which passed the council 10-2, offered forgivable loans to homebuyers who were interested in properties on the same block as foreclosed or city-owned properties within targeted neighborhoods.<ref name=Brandt>{{cite news|last=Brandt|first=Steve|title=Minneapolis City Council authorized a pilot loan program Friday to try to prop up foreclosure-sapped neighborhoods|newspaper= Star Tribune|date=April 5, 2008}}</ref>   Schiff argued that the initiative was not targeted enough to have the designed effect and voted against it, along with fellow councilmember Paul Ostrow.<ref name=Brandt/>   

The city also strictly regulated non-motorized [[pedicab]]s; it first permitted the bicycle-powered taxis in 1984, but there were no active pedicab licenses in the city by 2008.<ref>{{cite news|last=Pease|first=Steve|title=Greasing the Wheels: Pedicab Hours Expanded|newspaper=Downtown Journal|date=September 8, 2008}}</ref>   Schiff proposed eliminating some restrictions, and the city council passed ordinances allowing pedicabs to operate on downtown streets, downtown bridges, and on the Nicollet Mall, at anytime except the morning and evening rush hours.<ref>{{cite news|last=Pease|first=''Ibid''}}</ref>   In October 2011, when the city permitted pedicabs to operate during rush hours (with new safety regulations), eight licensed pedicab companies operated forty cabs in the downtown area.<ref>{{cite news|last=Brandt|first=Steve|title=Keeping Tabs on Pedicabs|newspaper= Star Tribune|date=October 9, 2011}}</ref>  

===Third term (2009<U+2013>2013)===
[[File:Gary Schiff 2009 Ward 9 Candidate Forum.png|thumb|left|Gary Schiff speaking at a Ward 9 candidate forum in 2009]]
In February 2012, a reporter for the ''[[Minnesota Daily]]'' wrote that Schiff is "possibly the most active and popular City Council member" and noted that 60 percent of Ward 9 voters reelected him to a third term in 2009.<ref>{{cite news|last=Sudheimer|first=Nick|title=Map Would Pit Ward 2<U+2019>s Cam Gordon against Fellow Councilman: The Green Party is Concerned About the Proposed Map|newspaper=Minnesota Daily|date=February 20, 2012|url=http://www.mndaily.com/2012/02/20/map-would-pit-ward-2%E2%80%99s-cam-gordon-against-fellow-councilman}}</ref>

An avid supporter of microbrewing in Minneapolis, Schiff sponsored the "Brew Beer Here" ordinance that allowed the sale of 64-ounce "growlers" of beer on Minneapolis brewery premises.<ref>{{cite news|last=Brandt|first=Steve|title=City Council Could Open Doors for Brewers: The Changed Ordinance Would Allow Microbrewers to Sell Products directly, Instead of Relying on Distributors|newspaper= Star Tribune|date=August 3, 2010|url=http://www.startribune.com/local/minneapolis/99810369.html|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6E2F8w7x7|archivedate=January 29, 2013}}</ref> Passed in August 2010, the ordinance facilitated brewery operation within Minneapolis city limits and led to the opening of Harriet Brewing Company, the first Minneapolis brewery to open in decades.<ref>{{cite news|last=Horgen|first=Tom|title=Brewing Comes Home: After a Change in the Law, Harriet Brewing is the First New Brewery in the City of Minneapolis in Almost a Decade|newspaper= Star Tribune|date=February 4, 2011|url=http://www.startribune.com/entertainment/dining/115103284.html}}</ref>   With colleague Elizabeth Gidden, Schiff co-sponsored the "Surly Bill," an ordinance that permits breweries to sell pints of their products on-site.<ref>{{cite news|last=Brandt|first=Steve|title=Minneapolis Plan to Aid Fledgling Brewers Advances|newspaper= Star Tribune|date=August 8, 2011|url=http://www.startribune.com/local/minneapolis/127279918.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Rybak signs new 'taproom' beer ordinance|url=http://www.kare11.com/news/article/935626/14/Rybak-signs-new-taproom-beer-ordinance--,|publisher=KARE-11 News |date=August 24, 2011|accessdate=November 19, 2012}}</ref>   Schiff also proposed eliminating zoning constraints against establishments serving alcohol within 300 feet of a house of worship outside of the downtown area.<ref>{{cite news|title=Church-Spirits Rules are Outdated, Unfair: Relaxing Minneapolis Ordinance Would Help Small Businesses|newspaper= Star Tribune|date=November 14, 2011|author=Editorial|url=http://www.startribune.com/opinion/editorials/133719673.html}}</ref> The ordinance change was inspired by a struggle between Rob Miller, a brewer interested in opening a "pico brewery" called Dangerous Man Brewing in Northeast Minneapolis,<ref>{{cite news|last=Agnew|first=Michael|title=It's boom time for breweries: It's a good time to be a beer lover in Minnesota|newspaper= Star Tribune|date=January 5, 2012|url=http://www.startribune.com/lifestyle/taste/136680478.html}}</ref> and the church of Saints Cyril and Methodius Church, located across the street from the brewery's proposed location.<ref>{{cite news|last=Roper|first=Eric|title=City Explores Easing Church-Spirits Separation|newspaper= Star Tribune|date=November 7, 2011|url=http://www.startribune.com/politics/statelocal/133335713.html}}</ref>   

In 2009, the Minnesota Vikings moved forward on a $870 million plan to rebuild a downtown stadium on the site of the [[Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome]].<ref>{{cite news|title=New Vikings Stadium Proposal: $870M, No Pay Plan,|url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/10648689/1/new-vikings-stadium-proposal-870m-no-pay-plan.html|accessdate=November 19, 2012|newspaper=The Street|date=December 12, 2009|author=Associated PRess}}</ref>   The team also considered building a new stadium in other cities, including [[Anoka, Minnesota]]<ref>{{cite news|last=Buchan|first=Cliff|title=Anoka County/Vikings<U+2019> Stadium Proposal Gone, not Forgotten|newspaper=Forest Lake Times|date=November 23, 2011}}</ref> and [[Los Angeles]], California.<ref>{{cite news|title=Vikings Stadium Movement Afoot; NFL Boss Arriving; Wilf's Plane Spotted in L.A.

In 1997, before he became a member of the city council, Schiff co-authored an amendment to the City of Minneapolis Charter that mandated a voter referendum on city stadium subsidies that cost taxpayers over $10 million.<ref>{{cite news|last=Roper|first=Eric|title=Anti-Vikings Stadium Crowd Silent|newspaper= Star Tribune|date=May 29, 2012|url=http://www.startribune.com/local/minneapolis/155191275.html}}</ref> Though supportive of the Vikings remaining in Minneapolis in 2012,<ref name=vikingsop>{{cite news|last=Schiff|first=Gary|title=Send Vikings Bill Back to the Legislature" (editorial)|newspaper= Star Tribune|date=May 22, 2012}}</ref>   Schiff became an outspoken critic of the financing plan for the [[Vikings Stadium]] when it came to a vote before the Minneapolis City Council, in part because it bypassed the charter amendment.<ref name=Nelson/>   Schiff also argued that the plan's estimated cost to Minneapolis taxpayers, cited at $150 million in construction costs, failed to account for interest, maintenance costs, and upgrades over the course of the stadium's expected 30-year lifespan.<ref name=vikingsop/>    In a [[Minneapolis Star-Tribune]] editorial, Schiff quoted figures presented by the city's chief financial officer, Kevin Carpenter, which estimated a cumulative, 30-year cost that could range from $675 million to $890 million.<ref>{{cite news|title=Minneapolis' Slice of Stadium Funding Could Jump|newspaper= Star Tribune|date=May 22, 2012|first=Eric|last= Roper|first2=Mike |last2=Kaszuba}}</ref>   Despite Schiff's objections, the Minneapolis City Council approved the stadium financing 7-6.<ref>{{cite news|last=Melo|first=Frederick|title=Vikings Stadium Wins Minneapolis City Council's Final Approval|newspaper=St. Paul Pioneer Press|date=May 25, 2012}}</ref>
