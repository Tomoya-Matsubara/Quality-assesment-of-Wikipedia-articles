"'''Be More'''" is the twenty-eighth episode of the [[Adventure Time (season 5)|fifth season]] of the American [[animated television series]] ''[[Adventure Time]]''. It was written and [[storyboarding|storyboarded]] by Tom Herpich and Steve Wolfhard, from a story by Patrick McHale, [[Kent Osborne]], [[Pendleton Ward]], [[Rebecca Sugar]], Herpich, and Wolfhard. It originally aired on [[Cartoon Network]] on July 22, 2013. The episode guest stars [[Aziz Ansari]] as DMO, [[Paul F. Tompkins]] as the SMOs, and [[Chuck McCann]] as Moe.

The series follows the adventures of [[Finn the Human|Finn]] (voiced by [[Jeremy Shada]]), a human boy, and his best friend and adoptive brother [[Jake the Dog|Jake]] (voiced by [[John DiMaggio]]), a dog with magical powers to change shape and grow and shrink at will. In this episode, BMO, Finn and Jake's sentient computer game, accidentally deletes a core system driver, forcing Finn and Jake disguise themselves as MOs in order to infiltrate the MO factory and fix BMO. However, the three are pursued by security guard SMOs (voiced by Tompkins); Finn, Jake, and BMO eventually run into Moseph "Moe" Giovanni (voiced by McCann), the ancient and benevolent human-cyborg creator of the MOs, who explains BMO's backstory.

"Be More" was originally intended to have been produced during the series' [[Adventure Time (season 3)|third season]], but by the time it was eventually produced, it changed substantially. It was viewed by 2.67 million viewers and received a 0.7 rating among adults between the ages of 18 and 49. The episode received largely positive critical reviews, with Oliver Sava from ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' applauding the extrapolation of BMOs backstory, as well as its potential for narrative expansions.

==Plot==
While deleting files, BMO accidentally deletes its core system drivers. Finn and Jake decide to accompany BMO to the Mo Factory so that BMO can get the drivers re-installed; BMO cautions Finn and Jake that its memory will be erased, so the duo disguise themselves as robots and successfully sneak past DMO (voiced by [[Aziz Ansari]]) and infiltrate the facility. Once inside, they find the factory derelict and abandoned. DMO and the security SMOs (voiced by [[Paul F. Tompkins]]) soon catch onto Finn, Jake, and BMO's scheme and give chase. The three evade security and sneak into the SMO lounge.

BMO [[hack (computer security)|hack]]s into one of the SMOs and learns the location of the core system driver installation deck. Once again, the SMOs give chase until Finn, Jake, and BMO reach the heart of the facility. There, the three meet Moseph "Moe" Giovanni (voiced by [[Chuck McCann]]), the ancient and benevolent human-cyborg creator of the MOs. Moe explains BMO's backstory, revealing that BMO was created to take care of and have fun with Moe's son; however, Moe never had children and so he released BMO into the wild to find another family. Moe updates BMO drivers, and introduces it to his "family" of MOs.

Oliver Sava of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' awarded the episode a "B+". He applauded it for its exploration of BMO, its opening of new narrative opportunities with the introduction of Moe. Furthermore, he complimented both Ansari's and Tompkin's voice acting, noting that the "actors hired by this show have speaking voices that are immediately distinct, and that natural personality helps flesh out bit roles and make them memorable."<ref name=avclub/> Furthermore, Sava wrote that the entry's climax, featuring Moe explaining that BMO was built to understand fun was "an interesting insight into the philosophy behind this series" because the "childlike mentality of fun and play is an enlightened state in ''Adventure Time'', and BMO reaches that every day with Finn and Jake."<ref name=avclub>{{cite web|last=Sava|first=Oliver|title=Adventure Time: 'Be More'|url=http://www.avclub.com/review/adventure-time-be-more-100442|work=[[The A.V.
