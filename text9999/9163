My grandfather, to whom Egyptian nationality was accorded by exception, was crowned Bey by the Ottoman sultan. My father decided to renounce Italian nationality as a result of Mussolini's racist laws, but when Nasser came to power, my mother's goods were confiscated because she was French and my father's because he was Jewish. We were forced to stay home, we were chased out of public places and at that moment we decided to flee Egypt. Many fled secretly from fear of being imprisoned.
We were forced, like all Egyptian Jews, to sign papers according to which we renounced all our goods, our passport and our nationality, for those who had it, since the Jews had been for the most part Ottoman subjects and not Egyptian. The Jews promised in writing not to demand anything of the Egyptian State. The only right we had was to take one suitcase, which was searched and thrown to the ground and 20 Egyptian pounds that were taken from us anyway by the customs officials, not to mention the insults and acts of terror in front of my parents, both of whom were invalids.''</ref> In 1958 she attended the [[Institute of Archaeology]] at [[University College, London]], and moved to Switzerland in 1960 to continue her studies at the [[University of Geneva]],<ref name=Interview55>{{cite news|title=Eurabia: The Euro-Arab Axis An interview with Bat Ye'or|author=John W.

She described her experiences in the following manner:
<blockquote>I had witnessed the destruction, in a few short years, of a vibrant Jewish community living in Egypt for over 2,600 years and which had existed from the time of [[Jeremiah]] the Prophet. I saw the disintegration and flight of families, dispossessed and humiliated, the destruction of their synagogues, the bombing of the Jewish quarters and the terrorizing of a peaceful population. I have personally experienced the hardships of exile, the misery of statelessness <U+2212> and I wanted to get to the root cause of all this. I wanted to understand why the Jews from Arab countries, nearly a million, had shared my experience.<ref name="Interview55" /></blockquote>

==Main works==

===Dhimmitude===
{{Main|Dhimmitude}}

Ye'or is known for employing the neologism ''[[dhimmitude]]'', which she discusses in detail in ''[[Islam and Dhimmitude: Where Civilizations Collide]]''. She credits assassinated Lebanese president-elect and [[Kataeb Party|Phalangist]] militia leader [[Bachir Gemayel]] with coining the term. The term itself is made up of the word "dhimmi", which means "protected" in Arabic and "refers to the legal and social conditions of Jews and Christians living under Islamic rule".<ref>{{cite news|title=What is 'dhimmitude'?|author=[[Staff writer]]|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=DM&p_theme=dm&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=10ADAA9B9D71654A&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|newspaper=[[The Dallas Morning News]]|date=19 June 2005|accessdate=30 July 2012}}</ref>

The neologism ''dhimmitude'' bears purposely some phonetic resemblance with the word ''servitude''; ''servitude'' exists both in French and English languages; ''dhimmitude'' was intentionally invented in place of the French "dhimmit<U+00E9>" or the English "dhimmity", which might have been the words associated to "dhimma" in a non-polemical setting.

Ye'or describes dhimmitude as the "specific social condition that resulted from jihad," and as the "state of fear and insecurity" of "infidels" who are required to "accept a condition of humiliation."<ref>{{cite news|title=Islam's 'idealistic version of itself' not quite the reality|first=Julia|last=Duin|url=http://members.tripod.com/joe_matalski/Pages/idealistc.htm|newspaper=[[The Washington Times]]|date=30 October 2002|accessdate=3 August 2012}}</ref> She believes that "the dhimmi condition can only be understood in the context of Jihad," and studies the relationship between the theological tenets of Islam and the hardships of Christians and Jews under Islamic rule in different times and places.<ref>{{cite speech|title=Dhimmitude Past and Present : An Invented or Real History?|first=Bat|last=Ye'or|event=C.V.

<blockquote>Dhimmitude is the direct consequence of jihad. It embodie[s] all the Islamic laws and customs applied over a millennium on the vanquished population, Jews and Christians, living in the countries conquered by jihad and therefore Islamized. [We can observe a] return of the jihad ideology since the 1960s, and of some dhimmitude practices in Muslim countries applying the [[sharia]] [Islamic] law, or inspired by it. I stress ... the incompatibility between the concept of tolerance as expressed by the jihad-dhimmitude ideology, and the concept of human rights based on the equality of all human beings and the inalienability of their rights.<ref>{{cite news|title=Damned If You Do|author=Rod Dreher|url=http://old.nationalreview.com/dreher/dreher102902.asp|newspaper=[[The National Review]]|date=29 October 2002|accessdate=3 August 2012}}</ref></blockquote>

Though Bat Ye'or acknowledges that not all Muslims subscribe to so-called "militant jihad theories of society," she argues that the role of sharia in the 1990 [[Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam]] demonstrates that what she calls a perpetual war against those who won't submit to Islam is still an "operative paradigm" in Islamic countries.<ref>{{cite news|title=Jihad and Human Rights Today|author=Bat Ye'or|url=http://old.nationalreview.com/comment/comment-yeor070102.asp|newspaper=[[The National Review]]|date=1 July 2002|accessdate=3 August 2012}}</ref>

====Reception====
Bat Ye'or's work has attracted praise and criticism from academic historians and political commentators on Islam and the Middle East.

British historian [[Martin Gilbert]] has called her "the acknowledged expert on the plight of Jews and Christians in Muslim lands"<ref>Sir Martin Gilbert, ''A History of the Twentieth Century, Volume III: 1952<U+2013>1999'', p. 127: "Most of those who went elsewhere did so as 'stateless refugees, among them Gisele Orebi (later Gisele Litrman), who was to become the acknowledged expert on the plight of Jews and Christians in Muslim lands, and their vigorous champion: her book ''The Dhimmi''. Jews and Christians under Islam, written under the pen name Bat Ye'or, brought the issue of continuing discrimination to a wide public."</ref> In a ''[[Jerusalem Post]]'' interview, referring to ''Eurabia: The Euro-Arab Axis'' he stated "I've read Bat Yeor's book. I know her and have a great respect for her sense of anguish. ... I'm saying that her book<U+2014>which is 100 percent accurate<U+2014>is an alarm call that will ultimately prevent what she's warning about from taking place."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1171894492801&pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FPrinter|publisher=The Jerusalem Post|work=[[The Jerusalem Post]]|title=One on One with Sir Martin Gilbert: Hindsight and aforethought|author=Ruthie Blum}}</ref>

[[Bruce Bawer]], writing in the ''[[The Hudson Review]]'' on ''Eurabia: The Euro-Arab Axis'', wrote that "[n]o book explains the European Muslim situation, in all its complexity, more ably," "[i]t's hard to overstate this book's importance. ... Eurabia is eye-opening and required reading for anyone seriously interested in understanding Europe's current predicament and its probable fate."<ref>{{cite web|last=Bawer|first=Bruce|title=Crisis in Europe|work=The Hudson Review|volume=58|issue=4|date=Winter 2006|url=http://www.hudsonreview.com/bawerWi06.html}}</ref>

According to [[Daniel Pipes]],
:Bat Ye'or has traced a nearly secret history of Europe over the past thirty years, convincingly showing how the Euro-Arab Dialogue has blossomed from a minor discussion group into the engine for the continent's Islamization. In delineating this phenomenon, she also provides the intellectual resources with which to resist it. Will her message be listened to?<ref>{{cite web|last=Pipes|first=Daniel|title=Eurabia: The Euro-Arab Axis|publisher=[[Fairleigh Dickinson University]]|date=January 2005|url=http://www.fdupress.org/book_descriptions/0838640761.html}}</ref>

[[Robert Spencer (author)|Robert Spencer]], an American writer on the West's relationship with Islam, described her as "the pioneering scholar of dhimmitude, of the institutionalized discrimination and harassment of non-Muslims under Islamic law". He argued that she had turned this area, which he believed the "Middle East studies establishment" has hitherto been afraid of or indifferent to, into a field of academic study.<ref>Brian Lamb: [http://www.q-and-a.org/Transcript/?ProgramID=1086 Robert Spencer interview] (transcript), C-SPAN, 20 August 2006</ref> British writer [[David Pryce-Jones]] called her a "[[Cassandra]], a brave and far-sighted spirit."<ref name=Pryce-Jones>[[David Pryce-Jones|Pryce-Jones, David]]. "[http://www2.fdu.edu/fdupress/05102806review.html Captive continent]", ''National Review'', 9 May 2005</ref>

[[Johannes J.G. Jansen]], Professor of Arabic and Islamic studies at [[Utrecht University]], wrote in the ''[[Middle East Quarterly]]'' that "In 1985, Bat Ye'or offered Islamic studies a surprise with her book, ''The Dhimmi: Jews and Christians under Islam'', a convincing demonstration that the notion of a traditional, lenient, liberal, and tolerant Muslim treatment of the Jewish and Christian minorities is more myth than reality."<ref>{{cite journal|publisher=[[Middle East Forum]]|work=[[Middle East Quarterly]]|url=http://www.meforum.org/article/1288|title=Eurabia: The Euro-Arab Axis|author=Johannes J.G. Jansen|date=1 March 2005}}</ref>

According to historian [[Niall Ferguson]], "future historians will one day regard her coinage of the term 'Eurabia' as prophetic. Those who wish to live in a free society must be eternally vigilant. Bat Ye'or's vigilance is unrivalled."<ref>{{cite journal|work=[[London Review of Books]]|url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v27/n20/thomas-jones/short-cuts|title=Short Cuts|author=Thomas Jones}}</ref>

[[Irshad Manji]] describes her as "a scholar who dumps cold water on any dreamy view of how Muslims have historically dealt with the 'other'."<ref>Irshad Manji, ''The Trouble with Islam'', pg. 61</ref>

According to journalist [[Adi Schwartz]] from ''[[Haaretz]]'', the fact that she is not an academic and has never taught at any university, but has worked as an independent researcher, has, along with her opinions, made her a controversial figure. He quotes professor [[Robert Wistrich]], head of the [[Vidal Sassoon International Center for the Study of Antisemitism]], who notes that "[u]p until the 1980s, she was not accepted at all. In academic circles they scorned her publications. Only when [[Bernard Lewis]], Professor Emeritus of Near Eastern Studies at [[Princeton University]], published the book 'Jews of Islam' with quotations from Bat Ye'or did they begin to pay any attention to her. A real change toward her emerged in the 1990s, and especially in recent years.<ref>Adi Schwartz from Haaretz.com [http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/objects/pages/PrintArticleEn.jhtml?itemNo=728863 'The protocols of the elders of Brussels'] "Bat Ye'or's opinions have made her a controversial figure, as has the fact that she is not an academic and has never taught at any university. She conducts her research independently. Since the 1970s, Bat Ye'or, who is now 71, has published about 10 books, most of which deal with the life of the Christian and Jewish minorities in Muslim countries. "</ref> Lewis, though, on another occasion, called the term ''dhimmitude'' a "myth" that "contain[s] significant elements of truth," the "historic truth" being "in its usual place, somewhere in the middle between the extremes."<ref name=bernard_lewis>Bernard Lewis, [http://hnn.us/blogs/entries/21832.html 'The New Anti-Semitism'], ''The American Scholar Journal'' <U+2013> Volume 75 No. 1 Winter 2006 pp. 25<U+2013>36.</ref>

[[Mark R. Cohen]], a leading scholar of the history of Jewish communities of medieval Islam, thinks Bat Ye'or "has made famous" the term ''dhimmitude'' though he thinks it is "misleading." He feels that "[w]e may chose to employ" it keeping in mind that it "connotes protection (its meaning in Arabic) and that it guaranteed communal autonomy, relatively free practice of religion, and equal economic opportunities, as much as it signified inferior legal status."<ref name=cohen1>{{cite book|last=Cohen|first=Mark R.|authorlink=Mark R.

# She endeavors to "expose" what she thinks is an insidious European plot to conspire with Arab countries in an anti-American, anti-Israel, and anti-Semitic campaign, which will, in the end, backfire by reducing Europe to what she calls by the misleading term "dhimmitude." (p. 34)
# We may chose to employ the noun "dhimmitude," the term Bat Ye'or has made famous. But we need to keep in mind that the term dhimma connotes protection (its meaning in Arabic) and that it guaranteed communal autonomy, relatively free practice of religion, and equal economic opportunities, as much as it signified inferior legal status. (p. 36)</ref>

[[Michael Sells]], John Henry Barrows Professor of Islamic History and Literature at the [[University of Chicago]], argued that "by obscuring the existence of pre-Christian and other old, non-Christian communities in Europe as well as the reason for their disappearance in other areas of Europe, Bat Ye'or constructs an invidious comparison between the allegedly humane Europe of Christian and Enlightenment values and the ever present persecution within Islam. Whenever the possibility is raised of actually comparing circumstances of non-Christians in Europe to non-Muslims under Islamic governance in a careful, thoughtful manner, Bat Ye'or forecloses such comparison."<ref>{{cite book|title=The New Crusades: Constructing the Muslim Enemy|last=Qureshi|first=Emran|last2=Sells|first2=Michael Anthony|authorlink2=Michael Sells|year=2003|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|location=New York|page=364|accessdate=4 August 2012|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=n_zcNMoTYgkC&q=Bat+Ye%27or#v=snippet&q=Bat%20Ye'or&f=false|isbn=9780231126663}}</ref>

In a review of ''The Decline of Eastern Christianity Under Islam: From Jihad to Dhimmitude'' the American historian Robert Brenton Betts commented that the book dealt with Judaism at least as much as with Christianity, that the title was misleading and the central premise flawed. He said: "The general tone of the book is strident and anti-Muslim. This is coupled with selective scholarship designed to pick out the worst examples of anti-Christian behavior by Muslim governments, usually in time of war and threats to their own destruction (as in the case of the deplorable Armenian genocide of 1915). Add to this the attempt to demonize the so-called Islamic threat to Western civilization and the end-product is generally unedifying and frequently irritating."<ref>{{cite journal|author=Robert Brenton Betts|date=September 1997|title=The Decline of Eastern Christianity Under Islam: From Jihad to Dhimmitude (review)|journal=[[Middle East Policy]]|volume=5|issue=3|pages=200<U+2013>203|publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]]|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-19995282.html|accessdate=4 August 2012|doi=10.1111/j.1475-4967.1997.tb00274.x}} {{subscription needed}}</ref>

Sidney Griffith, the head of the department of Semitic and Egyptian Languages and Literatures at [[The Catholic University of America]] wrote in a review of ''Decline of Eastern Christianity'' that Ye'or has "raised a topic of vital interest"; adding, however, that the "theoretical inadequacy of the interpretive concepts of jihad and dhimmitude, as they are employed here", and the "want of historical method in the deployments of the documents which serve as evidence for the conclusions reached in the study" serve as dual barriers. He goes on to say "[quotations] are presented out of context, with no analysis or explanation. One has the impression that in their bulk they are simply meant to undergird the contentions made in the first part of the book", concluding that thus Ye'or has "written a polemical tract, not responsible historical analysis."<ref>Griffith, Sidney H., "The Decline of Eastern Christianity Under Islam: From Jihad to Dhimmitude", ''International Journal of Middle East Studies'', Vol. 30, No. 4. (Nov. 1998), pp. 619<U+2013>621.</ref>

According to the American scholar [[Joel Beinin]], Bat Ye'or exemplifies the "neo-lachrymose" perspective on Egyptian Jewish history. According to Beinin, this perspective has been "consecrated" as "the normative Zionist interpretation of the history of Jews in Egypt."<ref>{{cite book|title=The Dispersion of Egyptian Jewry: Culture, Politics, And The Formation Of A Modern Diaspora|last=Beinin|first=Joel|authorlink=Joel Beinin|year=2005|publisher=[[American University in Cairo Press]]|page=15|accessdate=4 August 2012|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ENfjCk1IZBcC&q=Bat+Ye%27or#v=snippet&q=Bat%20Ye'or&f=false|isbn=9789774248900}}</ref>

===Eurabia===
{{Main|Eurabia}}
Her books ''[[Eurabia: The Euro-Arab Axis]]'' and ''Europe, Globalization, and the Coming of the Universal Caliphate'' are about the alleged relationship from the 1970s onwards between the [[European Union]] (previously the [[European Economic Community]]) and the [[Arab world|Arab states]]. Ye'or claims that the alleged influence of Islam, antiamericanism and antisemitism over European culture and politics is a product of a collaboration between radical Arabs and Muslims, on one hand, and fascists, socialists, [[Nazi]]s, antisemitic rulers of Europe, on the other hand.<ref name=Lappen>{{cite news|title=Triple-pronged Jihad <U+2013> Military, Economic and Cultural|author=Alyssa A.

<blockquote>Eurabia is a geo-political reality envisaged in 1973 through a system of informal alliances between, on the one hand, the nine countries of the European Community (EC) which, enlarged, became the European Union (EU) in 1992 and on the other hand, the Mediterranean Arab countries. The alliances and agreements were elaborated at the top political level of each EC country with the representative of the European Commission, and their Arab homologues with the Arab League's delegate. This system was synchronised under the roof of an association called the Euro-Arab Dialogue (EAD) created in July 1974 in Paris. A working body composed of committees and always presided jointly by a European and an Arab delegate planned the agendas, and organized and monitored the application of the decisions.</blockquote>

{{quote|"In order to accept Ye'or's ridiculous thesis, it is necessary to believe not only in the existence of a concerted Islamic plot to subjugate Europe, involving all Arab governments, whether 'Islamic' or not, but also to credit a secret and unelected parliamentary body with the astounding ability to transform all Europe's major political, economic and cultural institutions into subservient instruments of 'jihad' without any of the continent's press or elected institutions being aware of it."<ref name=Race />}}

Carr argues that Bat Ye'or is the "main inspiration" for many conspiracy theories current on the far-right. Furthermore, Carr notes that "[s]tripped of its Islamic content, the broad contours of Ye'or's preposterous thesis [in ''Eurabia: The Euro-Arab Axis''] recall the anti-Semitic conspiracy theories of the first half of the twentieth century and contemporary notions of the '[[Zionist Occupation Government]]' prevalent in far-right circles in the US".<ref name="Race">{{cite journal|author=Matt Carr|date=July 2006|title=You are now entering Eurabia|journal=[[Race & Class]]|volume=48|issue=1|pages=1<U+2013>22|publisher=[[SAGE Publications]]|doi=10.1177/0306396806066636|url=http://rac.sagepub.com/content/48/1/1|accessdate=4 August 2012}}</ref> He notes further that Bat Ye'or's analysis is driven by a contempt of "Islam's celebrated cultural achievements" and a view of Islam as a "perennially barbaric, parasitic and oppressive religion".
