'''''Never Say Never Again''''', released in 1983 by [[Warner Bros.]], is an adaptation of the [[James Bond]] novel [[Thunderball (novel)|''Thunderball'']], which was previously filmed in 1965 as the [[spy film]] [[Thunderball (film)|''Thunderball'']]. The film, like the original, stars [[Sean Connery]] as British Secret Service agent James Bond 007. Connery had been the first actor to portray Bond in a motion picture, in 1962's ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'', but he left the franchise in 1971 after his participation in the string of commercially successful films, interrupted by [[George Lazenby|George Lazenby's]] brief portrayal of Bond in [[On Her Majesty's Secret Service (film)|''On Her Majesty's Secret Service'']].

Unlike [[James Bond (film series)|the majority of Bond films]], ''Never Say Never Again'' was not produced by [[Eon Productions]], but by an independent production company, one of whose members was [[Kevin McClory]], one of the original writers of the ''Thunderball'' storyline with [[Ian Fleming]] and [[Jack Whittingham]]. Following a [[Thunderball (novel)#Controversy|long legal battle]] dating from the 1960s, McClory had been a producer on the original film and had retained rights which allowed him to re-make the story separately from Eon.

The title is based on a conversation between Sean Connery and his second wife, Micheline Roquebrune. After initially retiring from the role following ''[[Diamonds Are Forever (film)|Diamonds Are Forever]]'' (1971) he told the press he would "never" play James Bond; her response was that he should never say ''"never again"'': she is credited at the end of the film for her contribution. As a result, it was the first Bond film to use a non-Ian Fleming originated title. The film opened in the autumn of 1983 to positive critic reviews and was a commercial success, grossing $160 million at the box office, although this was less overall than the official Bond released in June of the same year, ''[[Octopussy]]''.

==Plot==
After [[MI6]] agent James Bond, 007 fails a routine training exercise, his superior, [[M (James Bond)|M]], orders Bond to enrol in a health clinic in London to get back into shape. While there, Bond witnesses a mysterious nurse named [[Fatima Blush]] giving a [[Sadomasochism| sadomasochistic]] beating of her patient in a nearby room. The man's face is bandaged and after Fatima finishes her beating, Bond sees the patient using a machine which [[Retinal scan|scans his eye]]. Bond is seen by Blush and an attempt is subsequently made to kill him in the clinic gym: however Bond manages to defeat the assassin by using a sample of his own [[urine]].

Blush and her charge, a United States Air Force pilot named Jack Petachi, are operatives of [[SPECTRE]], a criminal organisation run by [[Ernst Stavro Blofeld]]. Petachi has undergone an operation on his right eye to make it match the [[retinal]] pattern of the US President, which he uses to circumvent security at an [[USAFE#Operating bases|American military base in]] England.  Whilst doing so, he replaces the dummy [[Nuclear warhead|warheads]] in two [[cruise missile]]s with live [[W80 (nuclear warhead)|nuclear warheads]]; SPECTRE then obtains the warheads to extort billions of dollars from [[NATO]] governments. Blush subsequently murders Petachi.

Under orders from the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], M reluctantly reactivates the double-0 section and Bond is assigned the task of tracking down the missing weapons.  Before leaving, he is outfitted with several gadgets by [[Q (James Bond)|Q Branch]], including a fountain pen that shoots an explosive dart.  He meets [[Domino Petachi]], the pilot's sister, and her wealthy lover, [[Maximillian Largo]], another SPECTRE agent. Bond follows Largo and his yacht to the [[Bahamas]], where he spars with Fatima Blush and Largo.

Bond is informed by Nigel Small-Fawcett of the British Consulate that Largo's yacht is now heading for [[Nice, France|Nice]], France. There, Bond joins forces with his [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] counterpart, [[Felix Leiter]]. Bond goes to a beauty salon where he poses as an employee and, whilst giving Domino a massage, is informed by her that Largo is hosting an event at a casino that evening. At the charity event, Largo and Bond play a 3-D video game called ''Domination'', which Bond ultimately wins; Bond then informs Domino of her brother's death.  Bond returns to his villa to find Nicole, his French contact, dead, having been killed by Blush.  After a vehicle chase on his motorbike, Blush captures Bond. Forced to write his memoirs putting her as his "Number One" sexual partner, Bond uses his MI6-issue fountain pen to shoot Blush.

Bond and Felix then attempt to board Largo's motor yacht, the [[Disco Volante (ship)|''Flying Saucer'']], in search of the missing nuclear warheads.  Bond becomes trapped and is taken, with Domino, to Palmyra, Largo's base of operations in [[North Africa]].  Largo punishes Domino for betraying him by auctioning her off to some passing [[Arab]]s. Bond subsequently escapes and rescues Domino.

After her rescue, Domino and Bond reunite with Felix on a [[United States Navy|US Navy]] submarine and track Largo to a location known as The Tears of Allah, below a desert [[oasis]].  Bond and Leiter infiltrate the underground facility and a gun battle erupts between Felix's team and Largo's men in the temple. In the confusion Largo makes a getaway with one of the warheads.  Bond catches and fights Largo underwater. Just as Largo tries to detonate the last bomb, he is killed by Domino, taking revenge for her brother's death. Bond then returns to the Bahamas with Domino.

==Production==
''Never Say Never Again'' had its origins in the early 1960s following the controversy over the 1961 [[Thunderball (novel)#Controversy|Thunderball novel]].{{sfn|Pfeiffer|Worrall|1998|p=213}} Fleming, along with independent producer Kevin McClory and scriptwriter [[Jack Whittingham]] had worked together on a script for a potential Bond film, to be called Longitude 78 West,<ref name="Poliakoff (2000)"/> which was subsequently abandoned because of the costs involved.{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=226}} Fleming, "always reluctant to let a good idea lie idle",{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=226}} turned this into the novel ''Thunderball'' which did not credit either McClory or Whittingham;{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=198}} McClory then took Fleming to the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] in London for breach of copyright{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=199}} and the matter was settled in 1963.<ref name="Poliakoff (2000)">{{cite journal|last=Poliakoff|first=Keith|title=License to Copyright - The Ongoing Dispute Over the Ownership of James Bond|journal=Cardozo Arts & Entertainment Law Journal|publisher=[[Benjamin N.

In the mid-1970s McClory again started working on a project to bring the film to production and, with the working title ''Warhead'' he brought writer [[Len Deighton]] together with Sean Connery to work on a script.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=152}} The script ran into difficulties after accusations from Eon Productions that the project had gone beyond copyright restrictions, which confined McClory to a film based on the ''Thunderball'' novel only, and once again the project was deferred.{{sfn|Chapman|2009|p=184}} Towards the end of the 1970s developments were reported on the project under the name ''James Bond of the Secret Service'',{{sfn|Chapman|2009|p=184}} but when producer [[Jack Schwartzman]] became involved and cleared a number of the legal issues that still surrounded the project{{sfn|Pfeiffer|Worrall|1998|p=213}} he brought on board scriptwriter [[Lorenzo Semple Jr]]{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=240}} to work on the screenplay. Connery was unhappy with some aspects of the work and asked British television writers [[Dick Clement]] and [[Ian La Frenais]]<ref>{{cite web|title=La Frenais, Ian (1936-) and Clement, Dick (1937-)|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/462850/credits.html|work=[[Screenonline]]|publisher=[[British Film Institute]]|accessdate=3 September 2011}}</ref> to undertake re-writes, although they went uncredited for their efforts because of a restriction by the [[Writers Guild of America]].{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=155}} The film underwent one final change in title: after Connery had finished filming ''Diamonds are Forever'' he had pledged that he would "never" play Bond again.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=152}} Connery's wife, Micheline, suggested the title ''Never Say Never Again'', referring to her husband's vow.<ref>{{cite news|last=Dick|first=Sandra|title=Eighty big facts you must know about Big Tam|accessdate=5 September 2011|newspaper=[[Edinburgh Evening News]]|date=25 August 2010|page=20}}</ref> She is mentioned in the final credits of the film with "Title "''Never Say Never Again''" By: Micheline Connery". A final attempt by Fleming's trustees to block the film was made in the High Courts in London in the spring of 1983, but these were thrown out by the court and ''Never Say Never Again'' was permitted to proceed.{{sfn|Chapman|2009|p=185}}

===Cast and crew===
When producer Kevin McClory had first planned the film in 1964 he held initial talks with [[Richard Burton]] for the part of Bond,<ref>{{cite news|title=A Rival 007 - It Looks Like Burton|accessdate=2 September 2011|newspaper=[[Daily Express]]|date=21 February 1964|page=13}}</ref> although the project came to nothing because of the legal issues involved.  When the ''Warhead'' project was launched in the late 1970s, a number of actors were mentioned in the trade press, including [[Orson Welles]] for the part of Blofeld, [[Trevor Howard]] to play M and [[Richard Attenborough]] as director.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=152}} In 1978 the working title ''James Bond of the Secret Service'' was being used and Connery was in the frame once again, potentially going head-to-head with the next Eon Bond film, [[Moonraker (film)|''Moonraker'']].<ref>{{cite news|last=Davis|first=Victor|title=Bond versus Bond|accessdate=2 September 2011|newspaper=[[Daily Express]]|date=29 July 1978|page=4}}</ref> By 1980, with legal issues again causing the project to founder,{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=153}} Connery thought himself unlikely to play the role, as he stated in an interview in the ''[[Sunday Express]]'' "when I first worked on the script with Len I had no thought of actually being in the film".<ref name="Mann (1980)">{{cite news|last=Mann|first=Roderick|title=Why Sean won't now be back as 007...|accessdate=2 September 2011|newspaper=[[Sunday Express]]|date=23 March 1980|page=23}}</ref> When producer Jack Schwartzman became involved, he asked Connery to play Bond: Connery agreed, asking (and getting) a fee of $3 million, (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|3|1983}}}} million in {{CURRENTYEAR}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US|df=y}}) a percentage of the profits, as well as casting and script approval.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=154}} Subsequent to Connery reprising the role, the script has several references to Bond's advancing years <U+2013> playing on Connery being 52 at the time of filming{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=154}} <U+2013> and academic Jeremy Black has pointed out that there are other aspects of age and disillusionment in the film, such as the Shrubland's porter referring to Bond's car ("they don't make them like that any more"), the new M having no use for the 00 section and Q with his reduced budgets.{{sfn|Black|2004|p=58}}

For the main villain in the film, Maximillian Largo, Connery suggested Klaus Maria Brandauer, the lead of the 1981 [[Academy Award]]-winning Hungarian film [[Mephisto (1981 film)|''Mephisto'']].{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=243}} Through the same route came [[Max von Sydow]] as Ernst Stavro Blofeld,{{sfn|Smith|2002|p=195}} although he still retained his Eon-originated white cat in the film.{{sfn|Chapman|2009|p=135}} For the [[femme fatale]], Director Irvin Kershner selected former model and ''[[Playgirl]]'' cover girl Barbara Carrera to play Fatima Blush <U+2013> the name coming from one of the early scripts of [[Thunderball (novel)|''Thunderball'']].{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=155}} Carrera was nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Barbara Carrera|url=http://www.goldenglobes.org/browse/member/28374|work=Official [[Golden Globe Award]] Website |publisher=[[Hollywood Foreign Press Association]]|accessdate=2 September 2011}}</ref> at the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress <U+2013> Motion Picture#1980s|1984 awards]] for her portrayal of Fatima Blush, losing out to [[Cher]] for her role in ''[[Silkwood]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role in a Motion Picture|url=http://www.goldenglobes.org/browse/category_year/608|work=Official [[Golden Globe Award]] Website|publisher=[[Hollywood Foreign Press Association]]|accessdate=3 September 2011}}</ref>

Micheline Connery, Sean's wife, had met up-and-coming actress Kim Basinger at a hotel in London and suggested her to Connery, which he agreed upon.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=155}} For the role of Felix Leiter, Connery spoke with Bernie Casey, saying that as the Leiter role was never remembered by audiences, using a black Leiter may make him more memorable.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=243}}  Others cast included comedian [[Rowan Atkinson]], who would later parody Bond in his role of ''[[Johnny English]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Johnny English|url=http://plrcatalogue.pearson.com/Samples/PRFS_058277957X.pdf|work=Penguin Readers Factsheets|accessdate=5 September 2011|year=2003}}</ref> 

Former Eon Production's editor and director of ''[[On Her Majesty's Secret Service (film)|On Her Majesty's Secret Service]]'', [[Peter R.

Production on the film was troubled{{sfn|Smith|2002|p=199}} with Connery taking on many of the production duties with assistant director David Tomblin.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=156}} Director Irvin Kershner was critical of producer Jack Schwartzman, saying that whilst he was a good businessman "he didn't have the experience of a film producer".{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=156}} After the production ran out of money, Schwartzman had to fund further production out of his own pocket and later admitted he had underestimated the amount the film would cost to make.{{sfn|Smith|2002|p=199}}  

Many of the elements of the Eon-produced Bond films were not present in ''Never Say Never Again'' for legal reasons. These included the [[Gun barrel sequence (James Bond)|gunbarrel sequence]], where a screen full of 007 symbols appeared instead, and similarly there was no 'James Bond Theme' to use, although no effort was made to supplement another tune.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=240}} ''Never Say Never Again'' did not use a pre-credits sequence, which was filmed but not used;{{sfn|Smith|2002|p=193}} instead the film opens with the credits run over the top of the opening sequence of Bond on a training mission.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=156}}

===Music===
The music for ''Never Say Never Again'' was scored by [[Michel Legrand]] who had worked on the 1968 film [[The Thomas Crown Affair (1968 film)|''The Thomas Crown Affair'']], winning an [[Academy Award]] for [[The Windmills of Your Mind]].<ref name ="Oscar 1968">{{cite web|title=Academy Awards Database|publisher=[[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]]|accessdate=4 September 2011}}</ref> The score has been criticised as "anachronistic and misjudged",{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=156}} "bizzarely intermittent"{{sfn|Smith|2002|p=197}} and "the most disappointing feature of the film".{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=243}} Legrand also wrote the main theme 'Never Say Never Again', which carried the lyrics of [[Alan Bergman|Alan]] and [[Marilyn Bergman]], who had also won the Academy Award with Legrand for The Windmills of Your Mind.<ref name ="Oscar 1968"/> 'Never Say Never Again' was sung by [[Lani Hall]].{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=243}}

He wrote that Klaus Maria Brandauer was "played with silky, neurotic charm",<ref name=" Schickel (1983)">{{cite news|last=Schickel|first=Richard|title=Cinema: Raking Up the Autumn Leavings|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,952223,00.html#ixzz1Vl0PhpEl|accessdate=31 August 2011|newspaper=[[Time (magazine)| ''Time'']]|date=17 October 1983}}</ref> whilst Barbara Carrera, playing Fatima Blush, "deftly parodies all the fatal femmes who have slithered through Bond's career".<ref name=" Schickel (1983)"/>  Schickel<U+2019>s highest praise was saved for the return of Connery, observing "it is good to see Connery's grave stylishness in this role again. It makes Bond's cynicism and opportunism seem the product of genuine worldliness (and world weariness) as opposed to Roger Moore's mere twirpishness."<ref name=" Schickel (1983)"/>

[[Janet Maslin]], writing in ''[[The New York Times]]'', was broadly praising of the film, saying she thought that ''Never Say Never Again'' "has noticeably more humor and character than the Bond films usually provide. It has a marvelous villain in Largo."<ref name="Maslin (1983)">{{cite news|last=Maslin|first=Janet|title=Sean Connery is Seasoned James Bond|accessdate=31 August 2011|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=7 October 1983|page=13}}</ref> Maslin also thought highly of Connery in the role, observing that "in ''Never Say Never Again'', the formula is broadened to accommodate an older, seasoned man of much greater stature, and Mr. Connery expertly fills the bill."<ref name="Maslin (1983)"/> Writing in ''[[The Washington Post]]'', Gary Arnold was fulsome in his praise, saying that ''Never Say Never Again'' is "one of the best James Bond adventure thrillers ever made",<ref name="Arnold (1983)">{{cite news|last=Arnold|first=Gary|title='Never': Better Than Ever; Sean Connery Rides Again in the Best of Bonds|accessdate=31 August 2011|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=6 October 1983|page=E1}}</ref> going on to say that "this picture is likely to remain a cherished, savory example of commercial filmmaking at its most astute and accomplished."<ref name="Arnold (1983)"/>  Arnold went further, saying that "''Never Say Never Again'' is the best acted Bond picture ever made, because it clearly surpasses any predecessors in the area of inventive and clever character delineation".<ref name="Arnold (1983)"/>

The critic for ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', [[Jay Scott]], also praised the film, saying that ''Never Say Never Again'' "may be the only instalment of the long-running series that has been helmed by a first-rate director".<ref name="Scott (1983)">{{cite news|last=Scott|first=Jay|title=A first-rate director works wonders: The classiest Bond of all|accessdate=31 August 2011|newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail ]]|date=7 October 1983}}</ref>  According to Scott, the director, with high quality support cast, resulted in the "classiest of all the Bonds".<ref name="Scott (1983)"/> [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film 3<U+00BD> out of 4 stars, and wrote that ''Never Say Never Again'', while consisting of a basic "Bond plot", was different from other Bond films: "For one thing, there's more of a human element in the movie, and it comes from Klaus Maria Brandauer, as Largo."<ref name="Ebert (1983)">{{Cite web|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19831007/REVIEWS/310070301/1023 |title=Never Say Never Again |last=Ebert |first=Roger |date=7 October 1983 |publisher=rogerebert.com |accessdate=18 October 2008}}</ref> Ebert went on to add, "there was never a Beatles reunion...but here, by God, is Sean Connery as Sir James Bond.

===Reflective reviews===
Because ''Never Say Never Again'' is not an Eon-produced film, it has not been included in a number of subsequent reviews. Norman Wilner of [[MSN]] said that 1967's [[Casino Royale (1967 film)|''Casino Royale'']] and ''Never Say Never Again'' "exist outside the 'official' continuity, [and] are excluded from this list, just as they<U+2019>re absent from MGM<U+2019>s megabox.

In 1995 Michael Sauter of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' rated ''never Say Never Again'' as the ninth best Bond film to that point, after seventeen films had been released.
