The term '''Three Line Group''' describes a group of [[Attica|Attic]] [[black-figure vase painting|black-figure]] vase painters, as well as a type of vase. They belong to the last quarter of the sixth century BC.
 
The group's conventional name is based on its habit of separating the individual decorative stripes on small-format [[neck amphora]]e with three separating lines. The group produces work of increasingly worse quality during its period activity. Its decorations are rarely better than poor. In spite of the limited quality, their work reminded [[John Beazley]] of the [[Andokides Painter]]. The group's vases are often extensively inscribed. Apart from names of depicted figures, they can also bear [[kalos inscription|''kalos'' inscription]]s for ''Onetorides'' or ''Hippokrates''.
