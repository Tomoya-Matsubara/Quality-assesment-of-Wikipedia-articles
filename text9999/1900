'''Frank Abbott''' (September 5, 1836 &ndash; April 20, 1897) was president of the [[American Dental Association]] (1888), president of the '''National Association of Dental Faculties''' (1895), a renowned [[dentist]], an author on dental subjects, and an [[inventor]] of dental instruments such as various types of chisels, pluggers, excavators and scalers, some of which are still in use in the 21st century.

==Background==
Born to a transplanted [[English people|English]] family, he attended local schools in [[York County, Maine]] and farmed in [[Shapleigh]], [[Maine]] until the age of 16, when he began to travel. Beginning in 1855, he studied dentistry under Dr. J.E. Ostrander in [[Oneida, New York]]. At the age of 22 he opened his own dental practice in [[Johnstown (city), New York|Johnstown, New York]], and married Catherine Ann Cuyler, with whom he would have three children.

Upon the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]], he served as a [[lieutenant]] of the [[115th New York Volunteer Infantry]], and was captured at [[Harper's Ferry, West Virginia]]. He returned as a part of a prisoner exchange.

==Dental career==
After the civil war he returned to his practice. A year later he [[matriculated]] as a medical student at the [[City University of New York]]{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}. While there he was appointed as clinical [[lecturer]] in [[New York College of Dentistry]] (1866), as Professor of Operative Dentistry (1868) and as [[Dean (education)|dean]], (1869).

From 1894 - 1895 he failed in attempts to have the [[trustee]]s there establish a Chair of [[Pathology]] and [[Microbiology|Bacteriology]] (with his son as incumbent) and to have the [[New York University|University of New York]] regents replace an act of incorporation of the college with a new regent-approved charter. {{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

Other subsequent initiatives of his also later failed. In addition to the invented dental instruments mentioned above, he also invented the first authomatic [[hammer|mallet]] with an effective back-action. He also collected rare American history prints.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}
