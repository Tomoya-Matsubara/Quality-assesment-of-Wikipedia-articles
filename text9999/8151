In [[crystallography]], the '''cubic''' (or '''isometric''') '''crystal system''' is a [[crystal system]] where the [[unit cell]] is in the shape of a [[cube]]. This is one of the most common and simplest shapes found in [[crystal]]s and [[mineral]]s.

There are three main varieties of these crystals:
*'''Primitive cubic''' (abbreviated '''cP'''<ref name=ITC213>International Tables for Crystallography (2006). Vol. A, Section 2.1.3, pp. 14<U+2013>16. [http://it.iucr.org/Ab/ch2o1v0001/sec2o1o3.pdf Link]</ref> and alternatively called '''simple cubic''')
*'''Body-centered cubic''' (abbreviated '''cI'''<ref name=ITC213/> or '''bcc'''),
*'''Face-centered cubic''' (abbreviated '''cF'''<ref name=ITC213/> or '''fcc''', and alternatively called '''cubic [[Close-packing of spheres|close-packed]]''' or '''ccp''')
Each is subdivided into other variants listed below. Note that although the ''unit cell'' in these crystals is conventionally taken to be a cube, the [[primitive cell|''primitive'' unit cell]] often is not. This is related to the fact that in most cubic crystal systems, there is more than one atom per cubic unit cell.

Cubic space groups
The three [[Bravais lattice]]s which form cubic crystal systems are:

|[[Image:Lattice_face_centered_cubic.svg|150px]]
|}

The '''primitive cubic''' system (cP)  consists of one lattice point on each corner of the cube. Each atom at a lattice point is then shared equally between eight adjacent cubes, and the unit cell therefore contains in total one atom ({{frac|8}}&nbsp;<U+00D7>&nbsp;8).<br>The '''body-centered cubic''' system (cI) has one lattice point in the center of the unit cell in addition to the eight corner points. It has a net total of 2 lattice points per unit cell ({{frac|8}}&nbsp;<U+00D7>&nbsp;8 +&nbsp;1).<br>The '''face-centered cubic''' system (cF) has lattice points on the faces of the cube, that each gives exactly one half contribution, in addition to the corner lattice points, giving a total of 4 lattice points per unit cell ({{frac|8}}&nbsp;<U+00D7>&nbsp;8 from the corners plus {{frac|2}}&nbsp;<U+00D7>&nbsp;6 from the faces).

The face-centered cubic system is closely related to the hexagonal close packed system, and the two systems differ only in the relative placements of their hexagonal layers. The [[Miller_index|[111]]] plane of a face-centered cubic system is a hexagonal grid.

Attempting to create a C-centered cubic crystal system (i.e., putting an extra lattice point in the center of each horizontal face) would result in a simple [[tetragonal]] [[Bravais lattice]].

Other terms for hexoctahedral are: normal class, [[wiktionary:holohedral|holohedral]], [[wiktionary:ditesseral|ditesseral]] central class, [[galena]] type.

==Voids in the unit cell==
[[File:visualisation_diamond_cubic.svg|thumb|upright|Visualisation of a diamond cubic unit cell: 1. Components of a unit cell, 2. One unit cell, 3. A lattice of 3 x 3 x 3 unit cells]]
A simple cubic unit cell has a single cubic void in the center.

A body-centered [[cube|cubic]] unit cell has six [[octahedron|octahedral]] voids located at the center of each face of the unit cell, for a total of three net octahedral voids. Additionally, there are 36 [[tetrahedron|tetrahedral]] voids located in an octahedral spacing around each octahedral void, for a total of eighteen net tetrahedral voids. These tetrahedral voids are not local maxima and are not technically voids, but they do occasionally appear in multi-atom unit cells.

A face-centered cubic unit cell has eight tetrahedral voids located slightly towards the center from each corner of the unit cell, for a total of eight net tetrahedral voids. Additionally, there are twelve octahedral voids located at the center of edge of the unit cell as well as one octahedral hole in the very center, for a total of four net octahedral voids.

One important characteristic of a crystalline structure is its [[atomic packing factor]]. This is calculated by assuming that all the atoms are identical spheres, with a radius large enough that each sphere abuts the next. The atomic packing factor is the proportion of space filled by these spheres.

Assuming one atom per lattice point, in a primitive cubic lattice with cube side length ''a'', the sphere radius would be {{frac|''a''|2}} and the atomic packing factor turns out to be about 0.524 (which is quite low). Similarly, in a ''bcc'' lattice, the atomic packing factor is 0.680, and in ''fcc'' it is 0.740<!-- pi/sqrt(18) -->. The ''fcc'' value is the [[Close-packing|highest theoretically possible value]] for any lattice, although there are other lattices which also achieve the same value, such as [[hexagonal close packed]] and one version of tetrahedral bcc.

As a rule, since atoms in a solid attract each other, the more tightly packed arrangements of atoms tend to be more common. (Loosely packed arrangements do occur, though, for example if the [[orbital hybridization]] demands certain [[bond angle]]s.) Accordingly, the primitive-cubic structure, with especially low atomic packing factor, is rare in nature, but is found in [[polonium]].<ref>{{Greenwood&Earnshaw}}</ref><ref>The original discovery was in J. Chem. Phys. '''14''', 569 (1946).</ref> The ''bcc'' and fcc, with their higher densities, are both quite common in nature. Examples of ''bcc'' include [[iron]], [[chromium]], [[tungsten]], and [[niobium]]. Examples of ''fcc'' include [[aluminium]], [[copper]], [[gold]] and [[silver]].

==Multi-element compounds==
Compounds that consist of more than one element (e.g. [[binary compound]]s) often have crystal structures based on a cubic crystal system. Some of the more common ones are listed here.

===Caesium chloride structure===
[[Image:CsCl crystal.png|125px|thumb|right|A [[caesium chloride]] unit cell. The two colors of spheres represent the two types of atoms.]]

The [[space group]] of the Caesium chloride structure is called Pm{{overline|3}}m (in [[Hermann<U+2013>Mauguin notation]]), or "221" (in the International Tables for Crystallography). The [[commons:Strukturbericht|Strukturbericht designation]] is "B2".<ref>[http://cst-www.nrl.navy.mil/lattice/struk/b2.html The CsCl (B2) Structure]</ref>

One structure is the "interpenetrating primitive cubic" structure, also called the "[[caesium chloride]]" structure. Each of the two atom types forms a separate primitive cubic lattice, with an atom of one type at the center of each cube of the other type. Altogether, the arrangement of atoms is the same as body-centered cubic, but with alternating types of atoms at the different lattice sites. (See picture [http://www.ilpi.com/inorganic/structures/cscl/index.html here].) Alternately, one could view this lattice as a simple cubic structure with a secondary atom in its cubic void.

In addition to caesium chloride itself, the structure also appears in certain other [[alkali halide]]s when prepared at low temperatures or high pressures.<ref name=Seitz>Seitz, ''Modern Theory of Solids'' (1940), p.49</ref> Generally, this structure is more likely to be formed from two elements whose ions are of roughly the same size (for example, ionic radius of Cs<sup>+</sup> = 167 pm, and Cl<sup><U+2212></sup> = 181 pm) .

The [[coordination number]] of each atom in the structure is 8: the central cation is coordinated to 8 anions on the corners of a cube as shown, and similarly, the central anion is coordinated to 8 cations on the corners of a cube.

===Rock-salt structure===<!-- some wikilinks to section, like a fluorine -->

[[Image:NaCl polyhedra.png|200px|thumb|left|The rock-salt crystal structure. Each atom has six nearest neighbors, with [[octahedral geometry]].]]

The [[space group]] of the Rock-salt structure is called Fm{{overline|3}}m (in [[Hermann<U+2013>Mauguin notation]]), or "225" (in the International Tables for Crystallography). The Strukturbericht designation is "B1".<ref>[http://cst-www.nrl.navy.mil/lattice/struk/b1.html The NaCl (B1) Structure]</ref>

In the rock-salt or [[sodium chloride]] ([[halite]]) structure, each of the two atom types forms a separate face-centered cubic lattice, with the two lattices interpenetrating so as to form a 3D checkerboard pattern. (See picture [http://www.ilpi.com/inorganic/structures/nacl/index.html here].) Alternately, one could view this structure as a face-centered cubic structure with secondary atoms in its octahedral holes.

Examples of compounds with this structure include sodium chloride itself, along with almost all other alkali halides, and "many divalent metal oxides, sulfides, selenides, and tellurides".<ref name=Seitz/> More generally, this structure is more likely to be formed if the cation is slightly smaller than the anion (a cation/anion radius ratio of 0.414 to 0.732).

The coordination number of each atom in this structure is 6: each cation is coordinated to 6 anions at the vertices of an [[octahedron]], and similarly, each anion is coordinated to 6 cations at the vertices of an octahedron.

The interatomic distance (distance between cation and anion, or half the unit cell length ''a'') in some rock-salt-structure crystals are: 2.3&nbsp;<U+00C5>  (2.3&nbsp;<U+00D7>&nbsp;10<sup><U+2212>10</sup>&nbsp;m) for NaF,<ref>{{cite doi|10.1088/0022-3719/14/32/016}}</ref> 2.8&nbsp;<U+00C5> for NaCl,<ref>{{cite journal | journal = [[Acta Crystallographica|Acta Cryst.]] | year = 1965 | volume = 18 | pages = 926<U+2013>932 | title = Accuracy of an automatic diffractometer.

===Zincblende structure===
[[Image:Sphalerite-unit-cell-depth-fade-3D-balls.png|150px|thumb|A zincblende unit cell]]
The [[space group]] of the Zincblende structure is called F{{overline|4}}3m (in [[Hermann<U+2013>Mauguin notation]]), or 216.<ref>{{cite book|title=Quantum Theory of the Solid State|author=L. Kantorovich|page=32|url=http://books.google.com/?id=YoI2-QvDoUAC&pg=PA32|publisher=Springer|year=2004|isbn=1-4020-2153-4}}</ref><ref>[http://img.chem.ucl.ac.uk/sgp/large/216az1.htm Birkbeck College, University of London]</ref> The Strukturbericht designation is "B3".<ref>[http://cst-www.nrl.navy.mil/lattice/struk/b3.html The Zincblende (B3) Structure]</ref>

Another common structure is the "zincblende" structure (also spelled "zinc blende"), named after the mineral [[zincblende]] (sphalerite). As in the rock-salt structure, the two atom types form two interpenetrating face-centered cubic lattices. However, it differs from rock-salt structure in how the two lattices are positioned relative to one another. The zincblende structure has [[tetrahedron|tetrahedral]] [[coordination number|coordination]]: Each atom's nearest neighbors consist of four atoms of the opposite type, positioned like the four vertices of a [[regular tetrahedron]]. Altogether, the arrangement of atoms in zincblende structure is the same as [[diamond cubic]] structure, but with alternating types of atoms at the different lattice sites. (See picture [http://www.ilpi.com/inorganic/structures/zincblende/index.html here].)

Examples of compounds with this structure include zincblende itself, [[lead(II) nitrate]], many compound semiconductors (such as [[gallium arsenide]] and [[cadmium telluride]]), and a wide array of other binary compounds.

Additionally, if one were to take the two atoms to both be carbon, the zincblende structure is equivalent to the structure of diamond.

==Weaire<U+2013>Phelan structure==
[[File:12-14-hedral honeycomb.png|thumb|Weaire-Phelan structure]]
The [[Weaire-Phelan structure]] has Pm3n (223) symmetry. 

It has 3 orientations of stacked [[tetradecahedron]]s with [[pyritohedron|pyritohedral]] cells in the gaps. It is found as a [[crystal structure]] in [[chemistry]] where it is usually known as the "Type I [[clathrate]] structure". [[Gas hydrate]]s formed by methane, propane and carbon dioxide at low temperatures have a structure in which [[water]] molecules lie at the nodes of the Weaire<U+2013>Phelan structure and are [[hydrogen bond]]ed together, and the larger gas molecules are trapped in the polyhedral cages.
