The '''American White Ibis''' (''Eudocimus albus'') is a species of [[bird]] in the [[ibis]] family [[Threskiornithidae]]. It is found from the [[Mid-Atlantic states|mid-Atlantic]] and [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf Coast]] of the United States south through most of the New World tropics.<ref name="White Ibis, Identification, All About Birds">{{cite web|url=http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/White_Ibis/id |title=White Ibis, Identification |author=Cornell Lab of Ornithology|work=All About Birds|publisher=Cornell University|location=Ithaca, New York|accessdate=9 January 2012}}</ref> This ibis is a medium-sized bird with an overall white [[plumage]], bright red-orange down-curved bill and long legs, and black wing tips that are usually only visible in flight. Males are larger and have longer bills than females. The [[breeding season|breeding]] range runs along the Gulf and [[East Coast of the United States|Atlantic Coast]], and the coasts of Mexico and Central America. Outside the breeding period, the range extends further inland in North America and also includes the [[Caribbean]]. It is also found along the northwestern South American coastline in Colombia and Venezuela. Populations in central Venezuela overlap and interbreed with the [[Scarlet Ibis]]. The two have been classified by some authorities as a single species. 

The diet consists primarily of small aquatic prey such as insects and small fishes. [[Crayfish]]  are its preferred food in most regions; however, it can adjust its diet according to the habitat and prey abundance. It is a tactile non-visual forager, whose main [[foraging]] behavior is probing with its beak at the bottom of shallow water to feel for and to capture its prey.

During the breeding season, the American White Ibis gathers in huge [[Bird colony|colonies]] near water. Pairs are predominantly [[monogamous]] and both parents care for the young, although males tend to engage in [[promiscuity#Extra-pair_copulation_in_animals|extra-pair copulation]] with other females to increase their [[reproductive success]]. Males have also been found to [[Kleptoparasitism|pirate]] food from unmated females and juveniles during the breeding season. 

Human pollution has affected the behavior of the American White Ibis via an increase in the concentrations of [[methylmercury]], which is released into the environment from untreated waste. Exposure to methylmercury alters the hormone levels of American White Ibis, affecting their mating and [[Nesting instinct|nesting]] behavior and leading to lower reproduction rates.

== Taxonomy ==
The American White Ibis was one of the many [[Aves in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae|bird species originally described]] by [[Carl Linnaeus]] in the 1758 [[10th edition of Systema Naturae|10th edition]] of his ''[[Systema Naturae]]'', where it was given the [[Binomial nomenclature|binomial name]] of ''Scolopax albus''.<ref>{{cite book | last= Linnaeus | first =Carl | authorlink=Carolus Linnaeus | title=Systema Naturae per Regna Tria Naturae, Secundum Classes, Ordines, Genera, Species, cum Characteribus, Differentiis, Synonymis, Locis.

[[Johann Georg Wagler]]  gave the species its current binomial name in 1832 when he erected the new genus ''[[Eudocimus]]'', whose only other species is the [[Scarlet Ibis]] (''E.&nbsp;ruber''). There has long been debate on whether the two should be considered [[subspecies]] or closely related species,<ref name=Hancock10>{{cite book|author=Hancock, James; Kushlan, James A. |title=Storks, Ibises and Spoonbills of the World|chapter=American White Ibis|publisher=A&C Black|location=London|year=2010|origyear=1992|isbn=1408135000}}</ref> and the [[American Ornithologists' Union]] considers the two to be a [[superspecies]] as they are [[Parapatric speciation|parapatric]].<ref name=ramo/> The lack of observed [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]] was a large factor in the view that the species were separate.<ref name=Hancock10/>

However, in a field study published in 1987, researchers Cristina Ramo and Benjamin Busto found evidence of interbreeding in a population where the ranges of the Scarlet and White Ibises overlap along the coast and in the [[Los Llanos, Venezuela|Llanos region]] of Colombia and Venezuela. They observed individuals of the two species mating and pairing, as well as hybrid ibises with pale orange plumage, or white plumage with occasional orange feathers, and have proposed that these birds be classified as a single species,<ref name=ramo>{{cite doi|10.2307/1521240}}</ref><!-- cites previous three sentences --> which has been followed by least one [[field guide]].<ref name="Nellis01">{{cite book|last=Nellis|first=David W.|title=Common Coastal Birds of Florida & the Caribbean|publisher=Pineapple Press|location=Sarasota, Florida|year=2001|pages=151<U+2013>55|isbn=156164191X|url=http://books.google.com/?id=-REZ4R8wBg4C&pg=PA155&dq=American+White+Ibis#v=onepage&q=American%20White%20Ibis&f=false}}</ref> Hybrid ibises have also been recorded in Florida, where the Scarlet Ibis has been [[Introduced species|introduced]] into wild populations of American White Ibis. Birds of intermediate to red plumage have persisted for generations.<ref name=Hancock10/>

Ornithologists James Hancock and Jim Kushlan also consider the two to be a single species, with the differences in plumage, size, skin coloration and degree of bill darkening during breeding season forming the diagnostic characters. They have proposed the populations recontacted in northwestern South America after a period of separation, and that the color difference is likely due to the presence of an [[enzyme]] that allows uptake of [[pigment]] in the diet. They have raised the question whether white-plumaged birds of South America are in fact part of the ''ruber'' rather than the ''albus'' [[taxon]], and acknowledge that more investigation is needed to determine this.<ref name=Hancock10/>

==Distribution and habitat==
[[File:Schneesichler (Eudocimus albus)-001.jpg|right|thumb|Adults in shallow water at [[Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge]] near the Atlantic coast of Florida]]
The American White Ibis is most common in Florida, where over 30,000 have been counted in a single [[Bird colony|breeding colony]]. It also occurs throughout the Caribbean, on both coasts of Mexico (from [[Baja California]] southwards) and Central America, and as far south as Columbia and Venezuela. The non-breeding range extends further inland, reaching north to [[Virginia]], and west to eastern [[Texas]]. The species is known to wander, and has been sighted, sometimes in small flocks, in states far out of its usual range.<ref name="Nellis01"/><ref name="White Ibis - Birds of North America Online">{{cite web|url=http://bna.birds.cornell.edu/bna/species/009/articles/introduction|author=Kushlan, James A.; Bildstein, Keith L. |title=White Ibis|work=Birds of North America Online|publisher=Cornell University|date=10 February 2009|accessdate=26 April 2011}}</ref>

==Behavior==
[[File:White_Ibis_in_Florida.jpg|thumb|right|American White Ibis in a neighborhood pond in [[Tampa Bay]],[[Florida]] ]].
A field study late in the Florida nesting season revealed that on an average day, adult American White Ibis spent 10.25&nbsp;hours looking for food, 0.75&nbsp;hours flying, 13&nbsp;hours resting, roosting, and attending to their nests.<ref name=" Population Energetics of the American White Ibis">{{cite doi|10.2307/4084896}}</ref> Much of the time roosting is spent [[Personal grooming#In animals|preening]], biting and working their feathers with their long bills, as well as rubbing the [[uropygial gland|oil glands]] on the sides of their heads on back plumage. American White Ibis generally only preen themselves, not engaging in [[Social grooming|allopreening]] unless part of courtship behavior. Bathing often takes place before preening; ibis squat in water 5<U+2013>20&nbsp;cm (2<U+2013>8&nbsp;in) deep and flick water over themselves with each wing in succession. Hundreds of birds may bathe together around the time of courtship.<ref name=bnabehaviour/><!-- cites previous three sentences -->

The American White Ibis is [[Territory (animal)|territorial]], defending the nesting and display sites against intruders. [[Agonistic behaviour|Agonistic]] or threat displays include lunging forward with the bill in a horizontal posture, and standing upright and snapping the bill opposite another bird engaging in the same display. Birds also lunge and bite, often holding onto an opponent's head or wings.<ref name=bnabehaviour/><!-- cites previous three sentences -->

===Breeding and lifespan===
[[File:Ibis Tree.jpg|thumb|right|Birds roosting in a tree near to [[St. Johns River]], Florida]]
The American White Ibis pairs up in spring and breeds in huge [[Bird colony|colonies]], often with other waterbird species. Nesting begins as soon as suitable foraging and nesting habitat is available. The female selects the site, usually in the branches of a tree or shrub, which is often over water, and builds the nest, and males assist by bringing nest material.<ref name="White Ibis | National Audubon Society Birds" /> Anywhere from one to five [[bird egg|egg]]s are typically laid, with two or three being the most common. The eggs are matt pale blue-green in color with brown splotches and measure 5.8 x 3.9&nbsp;cm (2.3 x 1.5&nbsp;in) and weigh on average 50.8&nbsp;g (1.8&nbsp;oz).<ref name="Nellis01"/><!-- cites previous two sentences--> [[Clutch (eggs)|Clutch]] sizes are usually lower in coastal colonies as compared to inland colonies, although there are no statistically significant differences in the fledging rate of both colonies.<ref name=" Population Energetics of the American White Ibis"/> Throughout the mating and [[Avian incubation|incubation]] period, the male undergoes a period of [[starvation]] to stay close to the nest and aggressively defend his nest and mate from both predators and other ibises in preference to foraging for food.<ref name="Frederick, P. C. 1987. Responses of male White Ibises to their mate's extra-pair copulation behavior" /> In the 2006 breeding season, a non-breeding adult female was observed to be tending to multiple nests that belonged to other American White Ibises<U+2014>the first time the behavior has been documented for this species.<ref name="Multiple nest-tending behavior in an adult female White Ibis">{{cite doi|10.1675/1524-4695(2007)030[0150:MNBIAA]2.0.CO;2}}</ref>

Although the American White Ibis is predominantly [[monogamous]] and both sexes provide parental care to their young, the male often flies off to engage in [[extra pair copulation]] with other nesting females after mating with its primary female partner. These extra-pair copulations are usually done after the within-pair copulations,<ref name="Frederick, P.C. 1986. Extrapair Copulations in the Mating System">{{cite doi|10.2307/4534581}}</ref> and make up about 45% of all total matings, although only about 15% of all extra-pair copulations are successful.<ref name="Frederick, P.C. 1986. Extrapair Copulations in the Mating System"/> By not restricting the number of females it copulates with, the male is able to increase its reproductive success considerably. Although females are receptive towards extra-pair copulations, male mate-guarding greatly reduces the rate of successful female involvement in attempted extra-pair copulations by other males.<ref name="Frederick, P. C. 1987. Responses of male White Ibises to their mate's extra-pair copulation behavior">{{cite doi|10.2307/4600085}}</ref>

[[File:Juvenile American White Ibis.jpg|thumb|left|Juvenile in [[Everglades National Park]]. Some of its brown feathers have molted and have been replaced with white feathers.]]
The breeding success of the American White Ibis is sensitive to the [[hydrology|hydrological]] conditions of the [[ecosystem]] such as rainfall and water levels. Low and decreasing water levels predict good prey accessibility. Water level reversals, where levels rise in the breeding season, disperse prey and impact on foraging success. Nest numbers and average clutch sizes are smaller in periods of reduced prey availability.<ref name="Sensitivity of nesting Great Egrets (Ardea alba) and White Ibises (Eudocimus albus) to reduced prey availability">{{cite doi|10.1525/auk.2010.09144}}</ref><!-- cites two previous sentences --> The success rate of parents raising one or more young to 20 days of age ranges widely from 5 to 70% of nests, and varies greatly between nearby colonies.<ref name=bnademographics/> American White Ibis parents have been known to supplement their chicks' diet with items such as cockroaches and rotting food from human garbage in poorer years, when fish and crayfish are more scarce.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1111/j.1474-919X.2011.01101.x}}</ref> Studies have also shown that years with higher nesting numbers had significantly faster spring drying rates of water bodies than years with low nesting numbers. This is because faster drying rates means that there are fewer fish and increased available area where crayfish can be hunted.<ref name="Nesting Success of Five Ciconiiform Species in Relation to Water Conditions in the Florida Everglades" /> This highlights the fact that American White Ibises do not use probability of nesting failure as a key factor in determining nesting sites but instead, rely on other criteria such as prey availability and nest-site [[predation]] rates.<ref name="Chronic Tidally-Induced Nest Failure in a Colony of White Ibises" /> The draining of wetlands in south Florida has also impacted on species that forage in shallow water such as the American White Ibis, and its increase in numbers is a key indicator of restoration of habitat within the Everglades.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1016/j.ecolind.2008.10.012}}</ref>

The main cause of nest failure among the species is due to nest abandonment,<ref name="Nesting Success of Five Ciconiiform Species in Relation to Water Conditions in the Florida Everglades">{{cite doi|10.2307/4087667}}</ref> the leading cause of which is inundation from extremely high tides. Parents abandoned 61% of all nesting starts either during or immediately after extremely high tides. The eggs float out of the flooded nests, or get washed out into the sea by wave action. Incubating parents usually abandon the nest when the water or tidal levels reaches 3 to 8&nbsp;cm (1 to 4&nbsp;in) above the bottom of the nest cup. Nevertheless, there have been instances where the parents have been observed to transport their eggs to another nest in an attempt to salvage some of the eggs. However, despite the fact that some nesting sites face high chance of tidal damage every breeding season, American White Ibises still continue to nest in these areas because of other favorable conditions such as abundant nearby food sources and low egg predation rates.<ref name="Chronic Tidally-Induced Nest Failure in a Colony of White Ibises">{{cite doi|10.2307/1368495}}</ref> 

[[File:Eudocimus albus -Winter Haven, Florida, USA -juvenile-8 (2).jpg|thumb|right|Juvenile in Florida]]
The eggs hatch after about three weeks and the young are attended by both parents. Males are present around the nest for most of the day, and females most of the night. The parents exchange nest duties in the morning and in the evening. Most of the feeding of the chicks occurs during the period where they swap nesting duties. Little feeding is done in the period of the day that is between the two duty swaps and no feeding is done between midnight and 6&nbsp;a.m.<ref name=" Feeding Rhythm in Nestling White Ibis">{{cite doi|10.2307/4160835}}</ref> Chick mortality is highest in the first twenty days post hatching, with anywhere from 37 to 83% of hatchlings surviving to three weeks of age in the Everglades.<ref name=bnademographics/> During periods of food limitations and starvation events, the American White Ibis tends to exhibit sex-dependent pre-fledgling mortality.<ref name="Sex-Related Mortality">{{cite doi|10.1675/063.032.0114}}</ref> For many bird species that have sexually dimorphic nestlings, mortality rates are higher for larger-sized male nestlings as a result of the parents<U+2019> inability to meet its greater nutritional needs.<ref name="Parental investment and sex differences in juvenile mortality in birds and mammals">{{cite doi|10.1038/313131a0}}</ref> However, in the case of the American White Ibis, the male nestlings actually have a lower mortality rate as compared to the females despite being on average 15% greater in mass as compared to its female counterparts.<ref name="Sex-Related Mortality" /> Although current research has yet to discover the underlying factors to why the males tend to have better survival rates under such conditions, it is suspected that the parents tend to feed the larger male nestlings first because they are either perceived by the parents to have a higher chance of survival, or, being generally larger in size, the larger male nestlings simply out-compete the small females for food.<ref name="Parental investment and sex differences in juvenile mortality in birds and mammals" /> 

Bird predators may seize anywhere from 7% to 75% of the progeny in a breeding colony.<ref name=bnabehaviour/> The [[Fish Crow]] (''Corvus ossifragus'') is common raider of American White Ibis nests, accounting for up to 44% of egg loss in a field study at Battery Island, North Carolina.<ref name= "Fish Crow Predation on Eggs of the White Ibis at Battery Island, North Carolina">{{cite doi|10.2307/4087124}}</ref> Other predators of eggs and young include the [[Boat-tailed Grackle]] (''Quiscalus major''), [[Black-crowned Night Heron]] (''Nycticorax nycticorax''), gulls, and possibly vultures, as well as the [[common opossum]] (''Didelphis marsupialis''), [[raccoon]] (''Procyon lotor''), and rat snakes (''[[Elaphe]]'' species).<ref name=bnabehaviour/><!-- cites previous two sentences --> Egg predation rates of the American White Ibis decline with nest age owing to increased nest attentiveness by the parents, especially during the last week of incubation. High nest densities and reduced [[synchrony]] increase egg predation rates because of the increased opportunities afforded by the longer incubation times, as well as the greater availability of nests available for predation.<ref name= "Fish Crow Predation on Eggs of the White Ibis at Battery Island, North Carolina"/>

The American White Ibis begins breeding in its third summer, although birds in captivity may breed as young as nine or ten months of age.<ref name=bnademographics/> The oldest member of the species recorded in captivity was over 20 years of age, and a wild bird has been picked up 16 years and 4 months after being [[Bird ringing|banded]].<ref name="Nellis01"/>

===Diet===
[[File:Eudocimus albus -USA -eating a fish-8.jpg|left|thumb|Adult eating a fish]]
The American White Ibis prefers to eat [[crayfish]] and other [[crustacean]]s, but also takes [[aquatic insect]]s and small fishes.<ref name="White Ibis | National Audubon Society Birds" /><ref name="Estimation of crayfish abundance and size-structure in diets of White Ibis chicks">{{cite doi|10.1675/1524-4695-31.3.417}}</ref> Outside the nesting season, the diet is highly variable, as abundance and types of prey depend on the both region and [[habitat]]. In [[Los Llanos, Venezuela|Los Llanos]], located on the border of Columbia and Venezuela, the most frequent prey are [[insects]], such as fly larvae and beetles. Generally in North America the main prey are crustaceans, mostly crayfish.<ref name=" Food Habits of the Scarlet and White Ibis in the Orinoco Plains">{{cite doi|10.2307/1369623}}</ref> In the [[Everglades]] and cypress swamps, the diet is primarily made up of crayfish, while those that feed in willow ponds eat predominantly fish.  American White Ibises that feed in mangrove swamps focus on crabs.<ref name="Feeding Ecology and Prey Selection in the White Ibis" /> The tactile nature of the ibis' probing for food in mud means that it catches prey that are too slow to evade the ibis once located by its bill. In the Everglades, this means that crayfish make up a large part of the diet, but a more diverse array of invertebrates are taken in coastal areas.<ref name=" Prey Choice by Tactile-Foraging Wading Birds">{{cite doi|10.2307/4626707}}</ref> Although crayfish are sought by foraging ibises, [[prey switching]] to fish does occur if the latter prey item are found in great abundance. It is unclear whether the fish are more easily caught if overcrowded, or whether sheer numbers of fish mean that ibises are catching them instead of crayfish<U+2014>normally, fish are more agile than crayfish and hence elude the ibis' bill more easily. Fish are a more energy-rich source of food for the American White Ibis.<ref name="Feeding Ecology and Prey Selection in the White Ibis" /> In the breeding season, American White Ibises in a colony at Pumpkinseed Islandtravelled further to forage in freshwater wetlands and catch crayfish, than nearby saltwater areas where [[fiddler crab]]s predominated, indicating their benefit was worth the extra energy expended in fetching them for their young.<ref>{{cite journal|author= De Santo, Toni L.; Johnston, James W.; Bildstein,  Keith L. |title=Wetland Feeding Site Use by White Ibises (''Eudocimus albus'') Breeding in Coastal South Carolina |journal= Colonial Waterbirds|volume=20|issue=2|pages=167<U+2013>76|doi= 10.2307/1521683|year= 1997}}</ref> This travel results in the wholesale transport of nutrients across the landscape by the colony; in a successful breeding year the colony at Pumpkinseed Island was estimated to have contributed a third as much [[phosphorus]] to the neighboring estuary as other environmental processes.<ref>{{cite doi|10.2307/1352688}}</ref>

The American White Ibis is found in [[mixed-species foraging flock]]s with the [[Glossy Ibis]] (''Plegadis falcinellus'') in flooded fields, and the two species select different food items with little overlap; the former foraging for [[crab]]s and aquatic insects and the latter feeding mainly on grain.<ref name="Nellis01"/> The Wood Stork is also found in the same habitat in Florida, but hunts larger prey and a higher percentage of fish, so there is little overlap.<ref name=" Prey Choice by Tactile-Foraging Wading Birds"/> In the Llanos, where American White Ibis coexist with the Scarlet Ibis, their diets differ, the former consuming more [[Heteroptera|bugs]], fish and crustaceans, while the latter eat a much higher proportion of [[beetle]]s.<ref name=" Food Habits of the Scarlet and White Ibis in the Orinoco Plains"/> The [[Willet]] (''Tringa semipalmata'') has been observed trailing American White Ibis and catching prey disturbed by them, and even  [[Kleptoparasitism|kleptoparasitizing]] (stealing) from them, in [[J.

===Foraging===
[[File:Eudocimus albus -Bonita Beach, Bonita Springs, Florida, USA-8.ogv|thumbtime=1|thumb|right|Video of adults foraging on Bonita Beach, [[Bonita Springs, Florida]], USA]]
During the summer, the American White Ibis roams along the coast of tidal flats and mangrove swamps as the inland marshes are usually flooded. However, as the water level recedes in the fall, populations at the coast shift their foraging area inland, to inland marshes and swamplands.<ref name="Feeding Ecology and Prey Selection in the White Ibis" /> It has become more common in urban landscapes in Florida since the late 1990s,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://myfwc.com/media/1352386/White%20Ibis%20Supplemental%20Information.pdf|title=Supplemental Information for the White Ibis: Biological Status Review Report|author=Kushlan, Jim|date= 31 March 201|publisher=Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission|pages=3|accessdate=25 December 2011|location= Tallahassee, Florida}}</ref> and is one of a number of wetland-dependent bird species which forages in man-made ponds on  golf courses in the southwest of the state.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/pdffiles/UW/UW20700.pdf|title=WEC188: Wildlife in Urban Landscapes: Use of Golf Course Ponds  by Wetlands Birds|author=White, C.

The American White Ibis is a [[tactile]], nonvisual forager, which limits its ability to choose from a wide variety of prey.<ref name="Foraging Behavior of the White Ibis">{{cite doi|10.2307/4160923}}</ref> For the most part, the American White Ibis forages for food by tactile probing. It wades slowly through shallow water and sticks its long, downcurved [[beak|bill]] into the [[Substrate (marine biology)|substrate]] of the water body with its bill held at around 1 to 2&nbsp;cm (0.4<U+2013>0.8&nbsp;in) agape at the tip, and sweeps its long bill back and forth across the bottom to pick out suitable food items.<ref name="White Ibis, Identification, All About Birds" /> Birds may also probe when standing still. Groping with a wide open bill is a technique used by ibis in deeper water when alone, as is head swinging, in which the ibis swings its wide open bill widely in open water. Others copy this type of foraging if they see one ibis doing it. On land, the American White Ibis locates prey by sight and pecks, and does not have to insert its bill into the substrate.<ref name="Foraging Behavior of the White Ibis"/> The American White Ibis seeks small prey when other birds are around, as it needs time to break up  larger food items into smaller pieces to eat, and other predators such as herons and [[egret]]s often take the opportunity to rob the ibis of its catch.<ref name="Feeding Ecology and Prey Selection in the White Ibis" /><ref name=" Foraging Associates of White Ibis">{{cite doi|10.2307/4084623}}</ref> Along with the Scarlet Ibis, the species coexists with another five species of ibis in the Llanos in Venezuela. American White Ibis males are aggressive to and take prey items from smaller ibises, but the smaller females are more often the victims of this behavior.<ref>{{cite journal| title=Foraging Ecology of Seven Species of Neotropical Ibises (Threskiornithidae) during the Dry Season in the Llanos of Venezuela |author=  Frederick, Peter C.; Bildstein, Keith L | journal=The Wilson Bulletin |volume= 104|issue= 1 |pages=1<U+2013>21}}</ref>
[[File:Eudocimus albus -Port Orange, Florida, Florida, USA-8.jpg|left|thumb|Adults foraging for food in a front garden in Florida]]
Juveniles have lower foraging efficiency compared to adults and in most feeding flocks, the juveniles are usually outnumbered by the adults. They usually tend to stay close to one another and forage for food together at the peripheral region of the group.<ref name=" Age-Related Differences in the Flocking and Foraging Behavior of White Ibises In a South Carolina Salt Marsh.">{{cite doi|10.2307/1520966}}</ref> During the breeding season, adult male ibises have been recorded raiding other parent ibises who are feeding their young in the colony. The raiders force their bill down the throat of the victim<U+2014>either the parent about to disgorge their food or recently fed young<U+2014>and extract the ball of food.<ref name="Intraspecific Food Piracy in the White Ibis">{{cite doi|10.2307/4513062}}</ref> This behavior allows the otherwise starving adult males to obtain food without having to spend long periods of time away from the nest, and prevent its female mate copulating with another male ibis, which would reduce its own reproductive success. Females and juveniles almost never try to drive off the larger and more aggressive pirating males, but instead try to avoid or move away from them.<ref name="Intraspecific Food Piracy in the White Ibis" /> This pirating behavior is less common between two male ibises as the males will actively fight off the pirate.<ref name="Intraspecific Food Piracy in the White Ibis" /> The explanation of the species' [[sexual dimorphism]] of body size is unclear, because no differences between the sexes in feeding success rates or the foraging behavior have been observed and, as males are larger, they need more food than females.<ref name="Energetic Consequences of Sexual Size Dimorphism in White Ibises (<U+201C>Eudocimus albus<U+201D>)">{{cite doi|10.2307/4087293}}</ref>

==Parasites and mortality==
Causes of death of adult ibis are not well known. Alligators could feasibly prey on nesting ibises but there has been little research in the area.<ref name=bnademographics/> A flock of fifty adult American White Ibis were killed in a fire in the Everglades. The corpses were found in a dense swathe of cattail (''[[Typha angustifolia]]''), which suggested they had taken shelter there. It is unclear why they had not been able to fly away from the fire, but one hypothesis was that they had been foraging for insects disturbed by the fire.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Epanchin, Peter N. ; Heath, Julie A.; Frederick, Peter C. |date=2002|title=Effects of Fires on Foraging and Breeding Wading Birds in the Everglades|journal=The Wilson Bulletin|volume=114|issue=1|pages=139<U+2013>41 |url=http://www.wec.ufl.edu/faculty/frederickp/publications/Epanchin%20et%20al%2002%20Effects%20of%20Everglades%20fires%20on%20wading%20bird%20colonies.pdf|jstor=4164426}}</ref>

A total of 51 species of [[parasitic worm]] have been recovered from the American White Ibis, predominantly from the [[gastrointestinal system]] and particularly the [[small intestine]]. These include [[Cestoda]] (tapeworms), [[Acanthocephala]] (thorny headed worms), [[Nematode|Nematoda]] (roundworms), [[Digenea]] and [[Spirurida]]. Several roundworm and spirurid species have been found in the lining of the [[gizzard]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=''Patagifer lamothei'' n. sp (Digenea: Echinostomatidae: Nephrostominae) From the White Ibis ''Eudocimus albus'' (Threskiornithidae) from Texas, USA|author=Dronen, Norman O.; Blend, Charles K. |journal= Revista Mexicana de Biodiversidad |volume=79|pages=23S<U+2013>32S|year=2008}}</ref> Nematodes are more prevalent in American White Ibis from freshwater habitats, and cestodes more frequent in those from saltwater areas. One nematode found in adult birds, ''[[Skrjabinoclavia thapari]]'', is borne in the fiddler crab as an [[intermediate host]], while the thorny headed worm species ''[[Southwellina dimorpha]]'' is carried in crayfish and infests both adult and juvenile ibis.<ref name=bnademographics/>

== Status ==
The American White Ibis is classed as ''[[Least Concern]]'' on the [[IUCN Red List]]. The population consists of 150,000 mature adults, and is stable, although some populations have unknown trends. A partial survey of under 50% of the North American population published in 2007 found an almost six-fold increase in the last four decades. The estimated breeding range is huge, at 1,200,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (460,000&nbsp;mi<sup>2</sup>).<ref name=BirdLife/> Fluctuating breeding populations and high mobility of colonies make estimating the population difficult. Attempted censuses of breeding colonies across Texas, Louisiana, Florida, and the Carolinas yielded a count of 166,000 breeding birds in 2001, and 209,000 in 2004.<ref name=bnademographics/> The conservation status has been listed in two states<U+2014>it is a ''Species of Special Concern'' in Florida, and a species of ''Moderate Conservation Concern'' in Alabama. The preservation of colony sites and freshwater foraging areas is important to maintaining populations; however, the highly mobile nature of breeding colonies makes this challenging.<ref name=bnademographics/><!-- cites previous two sentences --> 

===Human impact===
[[John James Audubon]] reported that the American White Ibis was hunted and sold in Louisiana, and mainly eaten by American Indians. It had orange flesh and a strong fishy taste.<ref name=JAA/> Elsewhere, the flesh has been described as appealing on account of the crayfish diet, and both members of the genus ''Eudocimus'' have been hunted, which has been responsible for decline, across their range.<ref name=Hancock10/> Crawfish farmers in Louisiana have also shot them for foraging in crawfish ponds. Overall, the impact of hunting is not thought to be major.<ref name=bnademographics/>

The pollutant [[methylmercury]] is a globally distributed [[neurotoxin]] and an [[endocrine system]] disruptor. In the [[Everglades]] ecosystem, human pollution has led to increased concentrations of methylmercury, which have impacted the behaviors of the American White Ibis.<ref name="Relationships among mercury concentrations, hormones, and nesting efforts of White Ibises (Eudocimus Albus) in the Florida everglades">{{cite doi|10.2307/4090363}}</ref> [[Hormone]] levels in males are affected, leading to a decrease in the rates of key courtship behavior, and fewer approaches by females during the mating season.<ref name="Altered pairing behavior and reproductive success in White Ibises exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations of methylmercury">{{cite doi|10.1098/rspb.2010.2189}}</ref> In addition, methylmercury also increased male-male pairing behaviors by 55%.
