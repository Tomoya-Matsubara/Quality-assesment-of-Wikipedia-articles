'''Geoffrey "Geoff" Smith''' (born 14 March 1928) is an [[England|English]] former professional [[association football|footballer]] who played 253 league games for [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]] as a [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]], including 200 consecutive appearances. When he retired, he held club records for the number of [[shutout#Association football|clean sheets]] in a season and total clean sheets.

Smith was born in [[Cottingley, Bradford]], moved to nearby [[Keighley]] with his family before serving in [[Malayan Union|Malaya]] in the British Army at the end of his teens. His first trial at Bradford City was unsuccessful but after playing amateur football for [[Lancashire Combination|Lancashire Combination League]] sides [[Nelson F.C.|Nelson]] and [[Rossendale United F.C.|Rossendale United]], he was signed by Bradford's new manager [[Ivor Powell]] in 1952. He was at Bradford City for seven seasons and played in every league game between the final match of the [[1953<U+2013>54 in English football|1953<U+2013>54 season]] and October 1958. He eventually retired in 1959. After his football career, Smith and his wife ran two different off-licences for the remainder of their working life.

==Early life==
Smith was born in [[Cottingley, Bradford|Cottingley]] on the outskirts of [[Bradford]], [[England]], on 14 March 1928. He had a brother Jack<ref name="markham">{{cite book |last=Markham |pages=174<U+2013>175}}</ref> and during their childhood, the Smith family moved to [[Keighley]], where Smith first played [[association football|football]] for St Anne's Church. At the age of 18, Smith was called up to the army. He served in an infantry unit in [[Malayan Union|Malaya]] for two years before he returned to Keighley.<ref name="Keeper's catch"/>

==Football career==
===Early career===
Smith resumed his football career back at home with Keighley Central Club. A [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]], he was still playing for Keighley Central in 1948 when he was offered a trial with his local [[Football League]] side [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]], who were at the time in the [[Football League Third Division North|Third Division North]]. His trial was unsuccessful and he was released.<ref name="frost">{{cite book |last=Frost |page=139}}</ref> Instead, Smith joined [[Lancashire Combination|Lancashire Combination League]] side [[Nelson F.C.|Nelson]].<ref name="markham"/><ref name="frost"/> He was still living in Keighley, and travelled to Nelson by bus with his brother Jack, who had previously played for [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]] but had been released when [[Frank Buckley (footballer)|Major Frank Buckley]] took over as manager and instead also joined Nelson.<ref name="markham"/> Smith played for Nelson for three years<ref name="markham"/> at a time when the club were competing at the top of the Lancashire Combination and sought re-election back into the Football League.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nelsonfc.co.uk/feat/ed21/nelson_fc_19311982_220500/index.shtml |title=Nelson FC: 1931-1982 |date=2005-05-17 |accessdate=2010-09-08 |publisher=Nelson F.C.}}</ref> However, Smith initially gave up the game when Nelson could no longer afford to pay him. He was not long out of the game before he signed [[Rossendale United F.C.|Rossendale United]], a member of the Lancashire Combination's Second Division. Smith said the journey by bus was a difficult one so he bought a motorbike. However, like Nelson, Rossendale could not afford to pay him, and after another two years, Smith gave up the game once again.<ref name="markham"/>

===Bradford City===
In December 1952, on the advice of Smith's friend Roy Brook, who was in Bradford's second team, new Bradford City manager [[Ivor Powell]] invited Smith back to City for another trial and he played for the reserves against [[Gainsborough Trinity F.C.|Gainsborough Trinity]] and [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]].<ref name="markham"/><ref name="frost"/> This time, Smith's trial was successful and Bradford City <U+2013> still a Third Division North side <U+2013> signed him on amateur forms.<ref name="frost"/> Smith had played only seven games for the reserves in the [[Midland Football League|Midland League]] and was still unpaid when he was given his first-team debut against [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe United]] on 17 January 1953 coming into the side for [[Brendan McManus]],<ref name="markham"/><ref name="frost"/> whom Smith said was "having a rough time".<ref name="markham"/> It was not a good start for Smith, with City losing 4<U+2013>0, but he followed this with a [[shutout#Association football|clean sheet]] in his second game against [[Stockport County F.C.|Stockport County]]<ref>{{cite book |last=Frost |pages=246<U+2013>247}}</ref> and kept his place in the side for the remainder of the season, playing 19 games, before he signed part-time professional terms in July 1953.<ref name="frost"/> He had previously worked part-time as a lorry driver, earning <U+00A3>4 10s (<U+00A3>4.50) working 48 hours per week as a lorry driver, but the club did not want him driving around the country and offered him <U+00A3>10 per week plus a <U+00A3>4 win bonus. To supplement his playing contract, the club gave Smith a job looking after their [[Valley Parade]] ground.<ref name="markham"/>

During the mid-season break, McManus left City to join [[Frickley Athletic F.C.|Frickley Athletic]]. Instead, Powell signed [[Jimmy Gooch]] from [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] as his replacement. Gooch, aged 32, was more experienced than Smith and so took over as first-choice goalkeeper at the start of the [[1953-54 in English football|1953<U+2013>54 season]] playing the first 20 games.<ref name="markham"/> Smith was called up to the first-team in November for a 1<U+2013>1 draw with [[Hartlepool United F.C.|Hartlepools United]].<ref name="frost 248">{{cite book |last=Frost |pages=248<U+2013>249}}</ref> He remained in the side and played all but two games for the rest of the season, coming back into the team for the final league game of the season against [[Gateshead F.C.|Gateshead]] as City finished fifth.<ref name="markham"/><ref name="frost 248"/> He kept 11 clean sheets, which included equalling a club best five in consecutive matches as City won a record nine straight games,<ref name="frost 248"/><ref>{{cite book |last=Frost |page=350}}</ref> during which they conceded just one goal.<ref name="frost 248"/>

Gooch left City after just one season to join [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] leaving Smith to take over the "number one" shirt.<ref name="markham"/> For the next four seasons, Smith, who became a full-time professional, played every single first-team game for City which eventually led to him making 200 consecutive league appearances<ref name="frost"/> <U+2013> it was a run that coincided with one of 246 league and [[FA Cup]] games by [[defender (football)#Full back|full back]] [[George Mulholland (footballer)|George Mulholland]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Markham |page=137}}</ref> However, for three seasons, City could not match the fifth place gained in 1953<U+2013>54 and they remained a Third Division North side.<ref>{{cite book |last=Frost |pages=250<U+2013>257}}</ref> In 1957<U+2013>58, under Powell's replacement as manager [[Peter Jackson (footballer born 1905)|Peter Jackson]], City finished in third place but missed out on the title by nine points to Scunthorpe United.<ref>{{cite book |last=Butler |page=11}}</ref> During the season, Smith set a new club record of 18 clean sheets, one which was later equalled by [[Steve Smith (footballer born 1957)|Steve Smith]] and [[Eric McManus]].<ref name="frost"/>

The following season, Smith's run of consecutive games came to an end against [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] in October 1958,<ref name="frost"/> with Jim McCusker coming into the side to replace him for two games.<ref name="frost 258">{{cite book |last=Frost |pages=258<U+2013>259}}</ref> Smith's number of consecutive appearances is third on the club's list behind Mulholland's 231 games and [[Charlie Bicknell]].<ref name="frost 377">{{cite book |last=Frost |page=377}}</ref> He played 26 further games in the [[1958<U+2013>59 in English football|1958<U+2013>59 season]],<ref name="frost"/> in which the club finished 11th in the newy-formed [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]].<ref name="frost 258"/> The season proved to be Smith's final season for City as he decided to retire aged 31.<ref name="frost"/> His last game was a 2<U+2013>1 defeat, once again versus Reading, on 28 February 1959.<ref name="frost 258"/> When the season finished, Smith had played a total of 270 games for the club, 253 of which came in the league,<ref name="frost"/> keeping a club record 70 clean sheets.<ref name="markham"/><ref name="frost 377"/> His record stood until it was broken by [[Paul Tomlinson]] in the 1990s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bradfordcityfc.co.uk/page/BantamsGreats/0,,10266~687443,00.html |title=Ivor Powell <U+2013> Manager 1952<U+2013>1955 |accessdate=2010-08-28 |publisher=Bradford City A.F.C.}}</ref> When Smith retired, the club granted him and Mulholland each a sum of money rather than the proceeds of a [[Benefit (sports)|benefit match]].<ref name="frost"/>

==Personal life==
Smith met his wife Margaret at a ceilidh at St Anne's Social Club, in Keighley, in 1944, when they were both teenagers. They married after Smith returned from his two years in the army on 26 August 1950 at Holy Trinity Church, in Keighley. Together, they had two daughters.<ref name="Keeper's catch">{{cite news |url=http://www.keighleynews.co.uk/news/8353449.Keeper___s_catch_has_lasted_for_60_years/ |title=Keeper's catch has lasted for 60 years |date=2010-08-26 |accessdate=2010-08-28 |publisher=''Keighley News'' |first=Miran |last=Rahman}}</ref> Smith had been a motor mechanic before his football career, and after he retired from playing, he and his wife ran an off-licence store in [[Cross Roads, West Yorkshire|Cross Roads]] for 25 years and a newsagents in Keighley for another five years.
