'''Flame on the Iceberg''' is a [[dessert]] popular in [[Hong Kong]], similar to [[Baked Alaska]] in Western cuisine.  Decades ago, the delicacy was served only in high-end [[hotel]] restaurants, but today it can be tasted in many Western restaurants and even in some'' [[cha chaan teng]]''.

The dessert is an [[ice cream|ice cream]] ball in the middle of a [[sponge cake]], with [[cream]] on the top. [[Whisky]] and [[syrup]]<!--What kind of syrup?--> are poured over the top and the ball set alight before serving.
