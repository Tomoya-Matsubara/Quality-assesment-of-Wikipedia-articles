==Personal life==
Hurwicz was born in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]], to a [[Jewish]] family a few months before the [[October Revolution]]. The family had originated in Poland and had lived in [[Congress Poland]] (the part of [[Poland]] then within the [[Russian Empire]]) but had been displaced by [[World War I]]. Soon after Leonid's birth, the family returned to [[Warsaw]], [[Poland]].<ref name="Hughes"/> Hurwicz and his family experienced persecution by both the [[Bolshevik]]s and [[Nazism|Nazi]]s,<ref name="MN-resolution"/> as he again became a refugee when Hitler invaded Poland in 1939. His parents and brother fled Warsaw, only to be arrested and sent to Soviet [[labor camp]]s. Hurwicz, who had graduated from [[Warsaw University]] in 1938, at the time of Nazi invasion on [[Poland]] was in London, moved to [[Switzerland]] then to [[Portugal]] and finally in 1940 he emigrated to the [[United States]]. His family eventually joined him there.<ref name="Clement"/><ref name="Horwath"/>

Hurwicz hired Evelyn Jensen (born October 31, 1923), who grew up on a [[Wisconsin]] farm and was, at the time, an undergraduate in economics at the [[University of Chicago]], as his teaching assistant during the 1940s. They married in 1944<ref name="timeline">{{cite web|title=Perspectives on Leo Hurwicz, A Celebration of 90 Years (timeline)|format=PDF|url=http://www.econ.umn.edu/hurwicz_timeline.pdf|date=14 April 2007|publisher=University of Minnesota (econ.umn.edu)|accessdate=2007-10-16 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071025031226/http://www.econ.umn.edu/hurwicz_timeline.pdf <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-10-25}}</ref> and later lived on the [[Mississippi River]] parkway in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]].

His interests included linguistics, archaeology, biochemistry and music.<ref name="Hughes"/> His activities outside the field of economics included research in meteorology and membership in the [[National Science Foundation|NSF]] Commission on Weather Modification. When [[Eugene McCarthy]] ran for president of the United States, Hurwicz served in 1968 as a McCarthy delegate from Minnesota to the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] Convention and a member of the Democratic Party Platform Committee. He helped design the '[[walking subcaucus]]' method of allocating delegates among competing groups, which is still used today by political parties. He remained an active Democrat; even attending [[Minnesota Democratic caucuses, 2008|Precinct Caucus]] in February 2008, at age 90.<ref name="timeline"/>

He was hospitalized in mid-June 2008, suffering from renal failure. He died a week later in Minneapolis.<ref>[http://www.startribune.com/obituaries/21570704.html?location_refer=Homepage:highlightModules:1 Leonid Hurwicz, oldest Nobel winner, dies, Minneapolis Star Tribune, June 25, 2008]</ref><ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/26/business/26hurwicz.html?_r=1&scp=1&sq=hurwicz&st=nyt&oref=slogin Leonid Hurwicz, oldest Nobel winner, dies at 90, New York Times, June 26, 2008]</ref>

The [[University of Minnesota]], the College of Liberal Arts launched the [[Heller Hurwicz Institute]], a new global initiative in the College of Liberal Arts at the [[University of Minnesota]] created to inform public policy by supporting and promoting frontier economic research and by communicating our findings to leading academics, policymakers, and business executives around the world. The Institute will be housed in our department. Funds raised by the Institute will be used to attract and retain preeminent faculty and, in part, to support graduate student research.

The ''Leonid Hurwicz Distinguished Lecture'' is given to the Minnesota Economic Association (as is the Heller lecture). [[John Ledyard (economist)|John Ledyard]] (2007), [[Robert Lucas, Jr.|Robert Lucas]], [[Roger Myerson]], [[Edward C.
