'''Horseshoe Curve''' is a {{Convert|3485|ft|m|0|adj=on}}, triple-tracked, [[railroad]] [[Horseshoe curve|curve]] on the [[Norfolk Southern Railway]]'s [[Pittsburgh Line]] in [[Logan Township, Blair County, Pennsylvania|Logan Township]], [[Blair County, Pennsylvania|Blair County]] in the U.S. state of [[Pennsylvania]]. It is close to {{Convert|1300|ft|m|-2}} in diameter and has a [[grade (slope)|grade]] of almost 2&nbsp;percent. As a train travels west from [[Altoona, Pennsylvania|Altoona]], it ascends almost {{Convert|60|ft|m|-1}} in the {{Convert|0.66|mi|km|2|adj=on}} segment that makes up the curve and rotates 220&nbsp;degrees.

The curve was completed in 1854 by the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] as a means of lessening the grade to the summit of the [[Allegheny Mountains]] by increasing the distance. It was built as alternative to the time-consuming [[Allegheny Portage Railroad]], the only other method of traversing the mountains. It has formed an important part of the region's transport infrastructure since its opening, and during [[World War II]] was targeted by [[Nazi Germany]] in 1942 as a part of [[Operation Pastorius]]. The curve was later owned and used by the Pennsylvania Railroad's successors&mdash;[[Penn Central Transportation Company|Penn Central]], [[Conrail]], and Norfolk Southern. Horseshoe Curve was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] and designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1966. It was also designated a [[National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark]] in 2004.

Since its opening, Horseshoe Curve has been a tourist attraction. A trackside observation park for visitor's was completed in 1879. The park was renovated and a visitor's center constructed in the early 1990s. The center is managed by [[Railroaders Memorial Museum]] in Altoona and contains exhibits pertaining to the curve.

== Location and design ==
Horseshoe Curve is a {{Convert|3485|ft|m|0|adj=on}} segment of the [[Pittsburgh Line]], the [[Norfolk Southern Railway]]'s main east&ndash;west route in its Pittsburgh Division between [[Pittsburgh]] and [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]], Pennsylvania.<ref name="nom 8-3"/>{{Ref label|A|a|none}} Trains heading west from Altoona have to ascend a maximum grade of 1.85&nbsp;percent for {{Convert|12|mi|km|0}} to the summit of the [[Allegheny Mountains]] in [[Gallitzin, Pennsylvania|Gallitzin]].<ref name="Borkowski 112">Borkowski, p. 112.</ref> From there, trains traverse the [[Gallitzin Tunnel]]s and descend for {{Convert|25|mi|km|0}}, at a maximum grade of 1.05&nbsp;percent, into [[Johnstown, Pennsylvania|Johnstown]].<ref name="Borkowski 112"/>

The curve is located {{Convert|5|mi|km|0}} west of Altoona in Logan Township, Blair County at railroad milepost&nbsp;242. The Blair County Veterans Memorial Highway (SR 4008) parallels the valley west from Altoona and crosses under the curve via a tunnel.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Senate Bill 1716 |author=[[Pennsylvania General Assembly]] |location=[[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]] |publisher=Commonwealth of Pennsylvania |url=http://www.legis.state.pa.us/CFDOCS/Legis/PN/Public/btCheck.cfm?txtType=HTM&sessYr=1991&sessInd=0&billBody=S&billTyp=B&billNbr=1716&pn=2183 |accessdate=January 30, 2012}}</ref> Within the open eastern end of Horseshoe Curve is a dam and lake, the highest of a series of three reservoirs along the valley which are owned by the Altoona Water Authority and supply water to the city.<ref>Seidel, p. 18.</ref> Horseshoe Curve spans two ravines formed by creeks: [[Kittanning Run]] on the northern side, and [[Glenwhite Run]] on the southern.<ref name="usgs">{{Cite map |publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]] |year=2010 |title=Hollidaysburg, PA |scale=1 : 24,000 |series=7.5 Minute Quadrangle}}</ref><ref>{{Cite map |publisher=United States Geological Survey |year=2010 |title=Altoona, PA |scale=1 : 24,000 |series=7.5 Minute Quadrangle}}</ref>

== History ==
In 1834, the state of Pennsylvania constructed the [[Allegheny Portage Railroad]] across the Allegheny Mountains to connect [[Philadelphia]] and Pittsburgh.<ref name="howe"/> The Portage Railroad consisted of a series of canals and [[funicular|inclined planes]] and remained in use until the mid-19th century. The [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] was incorporated in 1847 and was tasked with building a railroad from Harrisburg to Pittsburgh, bypassing the cumbersome Portage Railroad.<ref name="howe"/>

=== Construction and use ===
[[File:The Horseshoe Curve, Pennsylvania, by H.C. White Co..jpg|thumb|[[Stereoscopy|Stereo card]] of a train rounding the curve, [[circa]] 1907]]
Using surveys done several years earlier, the state's engineers recommended a route west from [[Lewistown, Pennsylvania|Lewistown]] that followed the ridges, keeping the maximum [[grade (slope)|grade]] over the entire {{Convert|84|mi|km|0|adj=on}} line at 0.852&nbsp;percent.<ref name="nom 8-1">Greenwood, &sect; 8, p. 1.</ref> The Chief Engineer for the Pennsylvania Railroad [[John Edgar Thomson]], however, opted to construct a line from Lewistown following lower, flatter terrain along the [[Juniata River]] and having the steep grades only on a {{Convert|9.8|mi|km|1|adj=on}} stretch of track west of Altoona. It was discovered that the valley west of Altoona was split into two [[ravine]]s by a mountain. Surveys done east from Gallitzin had already determined a suitable route on the opposite side of the valley that would keep the grade manageable. Traversing the valley using a bridge would have created a grade of 4.37&nbsp;percent, which was too steep for most trains. To reduce the grade by increasing the distance between the points by using a curve, engineers constructed an earth [[embankment (transportation)|fill]] over the first ravine encountered while ascending, formed by Kittanning Run, [[cut (earthmoving)|cut]] the point of the mountain between the ravines, and filled in the second ravine, formed by Glenwhite Run.<ref name="nom 8-2"/>

Work on Horseshoe Curve began in 1850 and took over three years to complete.<ref name="nom 8-2"/> The construction was done any without [[heavy equipment (construction)|heavy equipment]]; only men "with picks and shovels, horses and drags" were used.<ref name="howe"/> The entire line, including Horseshoe Curve, was opened on February&nbsp;15, 1854. The total cost to lay the {{Convert|31.1|mi|km|1}} of track between Altoona and [[Johnstown, Pennsylvania|Johnstown]] was [[United States dollar|$]]2,495,000 or equivalent to $80,225 per mile ($49,850&nbsp;/km).<ref name="nom 8-3"/> The remaining part of the mountain inside the curve was leveled in 1879 to allow for the construction of a park and observation area&mdash;the first specifically built for viewing trains.<ref>{{Cite news |author=[[Associated Press]] |date=June 30, 2004 |title=Marvel of engineering celebrating milestone |newspaper=[[Reading Eagle]] |page=B10}}</ref> As the demand for train travel increased, a third set of tracks was added to the curve in 1898 and a fourth was added two years later to relieve congestion.<ref name="nom 8-3"/><ref name="woods"/>
