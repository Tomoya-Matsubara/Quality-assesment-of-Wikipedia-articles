'''James Clark''' (January 16, 1779 <U+2013> August 27, 1839) was a 19th century [[United States|American]] politician who served in all [[Separation of powers under the United States Constitution|three branches]] of [[Kentucky]]'s government and in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]]. His political career began in the [[Kentucky House of Representatives]] in 1807. In 1810, he was appointed to the [[Kentucky Court of Appeals]], where he served for two years before resigning to pursue a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. He served two terms in that body, resigning in 1816.

Clark accepted an appointment to the [[circuit court]] of [[Bourbon County, Kentucky|Bourbon]] and [[Clark County, Kentucky|Clark]] counties in 1817. It was in this capacity that the most defining event of his career occurred. In 1822, he [[Judicial review in the United States|struck down]] a debt relief law in the case of ''Williams v. Blair'' on the basis that it impeded the [[Contract Clause|obligation of contracts]]. His decision was unpopular with the legislature, who condemned the ruling and summoned Clark to appear before them and defend it. An attempt to [[impeachment|remove him from office]] fell short of the needed [[two-thirds majority]]. The following year, the Kentucky Court of Appeals upheld Clark's ruling. In retaliation, the legislature attempted to abolish the court and create a new one more sympathetic to their views. This event and its aftermath became known as the [[Old Court-New Court controversy]].

In 1825, Clark was chosen to fill the congressional seat vacated by [[Henry Clay]]'s elevation to [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]]. He served until 1831, but did not stand for re-election that year. He became active in organizing the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] in Kentucky, and was rewarded for his efforts by being chosen as the party's nominee for governor in 1836. He won the election and laid out an ambitious [[Party platform|platform]] to the legislature, which acted on only part of it. Clark's most significant accomplishment as governor was securing the creation of a state [[board of education]] and the establishment of public schools in every county in the state. Clark died in office in 1839. His estate, [[Governor Clark House|Holly Rood]], is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

From 1817 to 1824, Clark served on the [[circuit court]] for Clark and [[Bourbon County, Kentucky|Bourbon]] counties.<ref name=powell36 /> In the 1822 case of ''Williams v. Blair'', he declared unconstitutional a law allowing debtors to escape [[bankruptcy]] by imposing a [[Debt moratorium|moratorium]] on their debts.<ref name=harrison196 /> He contended that the law "impaired the obligation of contracts" in violation of the [[Contract Clause]] of the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]].<ref name=howard48>Howard, p. 48</ref> This decision was in keeping with the recent [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruling in [[Dartmouth College v.

===Governor of Kentucky===
Clark helped organize the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] in Kentucky, and as a reward, he was chosen as the party's nominee for governor in 1836.<ref name=harrison196 /> He won the canvass, defeating [[United States Democratic Party|Democrat]] Matthew Flournoy 38,587 to 30,491.<ref name=powell36 /> In his address to the legislature, he outlined an ambitious agenda of reforms, including the establishing a public school system, strengthening the office of state auditor, and combating an increase in crime.<ref name=harrison196 /> Believing that banks should be held to their responsibilities, he insisted that the state banks not suspend [[specie]] payments.<ref name=eok78>''Encyclopedia of Kentucky'', p. 78</ref> He also strongly believed in the rights of slave owners, and encouraged [[Ohio]], [[Indiana]], and [[Illinois]] to cooperate in returning escaped slaves.<ref name=eok78 /> 

The legislature heeded some of Clark's message. They added a second auditor in the office of the state auditor, and gave greater discretion to the state's [[sinking fund]] commission.<ref name=harrison196 /> They created a state board of education and the office of state superintendent.<ref name=harrison196 /> They also created county school commissioners in every county.<ref name=howard49>Howard, p. 49</ref> In response to his remarks on slave property, the legislature enacted laws that raised the reward for apprehending a fugitive slave and made it illegal for [[stagecoach]] owners to allow fugitive slaves to use their coaches to escape.<ref name=howard49 /> However, they refused to restrict the publication and spread of [[abolitionism|abolitionist]] [[propaganda]] in the state, as Clark had requested, and they ignored most of his recommendations in other areas.<ref name=harrison196 /> Clark financed [[internal improvements]] in the state through the sale of bonds.<ref name=eok78 />
