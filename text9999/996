He is principally remembered for his efforts in promoting and supporting the settlement of North America by the [[English people|English]] through his works, notably ''Divers Voyages Touching the Discoverie of America'' (1582) and ''The Principal Navigations, Voiages, Traffiques and Discoueries of the English Nation'' (1598<U+2013>1600).

Educated at [[Westminster School]] and [[Christ Church, Oxford]], between 1583 and 1588 Hakluyt was [[chaplain]] and [[secretary#Origins|secretary]] to Sir [[Edward Stafford of Grafton|Edward Stafford]], English [[ambassador]] at the French court. An [[ordination|ordained]] [[priest#Anglican or Episcopalian|priest]], Hakluyt held important positions at [[Bristol Cathedral]] and [[Westminster Abbey]] and was personal chaplain to [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Sir Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury]], principal [[Secretary of State (England)|Secretary of State]] to [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] and [[James I of England|James I]]. He was the chief promoter of a petition to James I for [[letters patent]] to colonize [[Virginia]], which were granted to the [[London Company]] and [[Plymouth Company]] (referred to collectively as the [[Virginia Company]]) in 1606.

According to one source,<ref name="Galileo Project"/> Hakluyt's first publication was ''A Shorte and Briefe Narration of the Two Nauigations and Discoueries to the Northwest Partes Called Newe Fraunce'' (1580), a translation of ''Bref R<U+00E9>cit et Succincte Narration de la Navigation Faite en MDXXXV et MDXXXVI''<ref>See {{cite book|author=Jacques Cartier|authorlink=Jacques Cartier|title=Bref Recit et Succincte Narration de la Navigation Faite en 1535 et 1536, par ...

However, this seems to be an error as the [[British Library]]'s copy of this work indicates it was translated from an Italian version into English by [[John Florio]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Jacques Cartier|authorlink=Jacques Cartier|title=A Shorte and Briefe Narration of the Two Nauigations and Discoueries to the Northwest Partes called Newe Fraunce, first Translated out of French into Italian by...

streate, neere vnto Baynardes Castell|year=1580}} Hakluyt did prepare his own translation of the Italian version of the work, but only published it in the third volume of the expanded edition of ''The Principal Navigations, Voiages, Traffiques and Discoueries of the English Nation'' (1600): see {{cite book|author=Henry S[weetser] Burrage (ed.)|title=...

Hakluyt's ''Voyages'' brought him to the notice of [[William Howard, 1st Baron Howard of Effingham|Lord Howard of Effingham]], and Sir [[Edward Stafford of Grafton|Edward Stafford]], Lord Howard's brother-in-law. At the age of 30, being acquainted with "the chiefest captaines at sea, the greatest merchants, and the best mariners of our nation",<ref name="Principall Navigations"/> he was selected as [[chaplain]] and [[secretary#Origins|secretary]] to accompany Stafford, now English [[ambassador]] at the French court, to [[Paris]] in 1583. In accordance with the instructions of Secretary [[Francis Walsingham]], he occupied himself chiefly in collecting information of the Spanish and French movements, and "making diligent inquirie of such things as might yield any light unto our westerne discoverie in America".<ref name="Encyclopaedia Britannica"/> Although this was his only visit to the [[Mainland Europe|Continent]] in his life, he was angered to hear the limitations of the English in terms of travel being discussed in Paris.<ref name="Principall Navigations"/>

The first-fruits of Hakluyt's labours in Paris were embodied in his important work entitled ''A Particuler Discourse Concerninge the Greate Necessitie and Manifolde Commodyties That Are Like to Growe to This Realme of Englande by the Westerne Discoueries Lately Attempted, Written in the Yere 1584'',<!--NOTE: Title based on 1993 Hakluyt Society edition from British Library catalogue. Original title stated in the article, which cannot yet be confirmed, was ''A Particuler Discourse Concerning Wesierne Discoveries Written in the Yere 1584, by Richarde Hackluyt of Oxforde, at the Requeste and Direction of the Righte Worshipfull Mr Walter Ragfly before the Comynge Home of his Twoo Barkes''--> which [[Walter Raleigh|Sir Walter Raleigh]] commissioned him to prepare. The manuscript, lost for almost 300 years, was published for the first time in 1877. Hakluyt revisited England in 1584, and laid a copy of the ''Discourse'' before [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] (to whom it had been dedicated) together with his analysis in [[Latin]] of [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politicks]]''. His objective was to recommend the enterprise of planting the English race in the unsettled parts of North America, and thus gain the Queen's support for [[Walter Raleigh#The New World|Raleigh's expedition]].<ref name="Galileo Project"/> In May 1585 when Hakluyt was in Paris with the English Embassy, the Queen granted to him the next [[prebendal stall]] at [[Bristol Cathedral]] that should become vacant,<ref name="Divers Voyages"/><ref>According to the ''Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica'', above, the Queen granted Hakluyt the next vacant prebendal stall at Bristol Cathedral two days before his return to Paris.</ref> to which he was admitted in 1585 or 1586 and held with other preferments till his death.

Hakluyt's other works during his time in Paris consisted mainly of [[translation]]s and compilations, with his own [[dedication#Book dedications|dedications]] and [[preface]]s. These latter writings, together with a few letters, are the only extant material out of which a [[biography]] of him can be framed. Hakluyt interested himself in the publication of the [[manuscript]] journal of [[Ren<U+00E9> de Laudonni<U+00E8>re]], the ''Histoire Notable de la Florida'' in Paris in 1586.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ren<U+00E9> de Laudonni<U+00E8>re|authorlink=Ren<U+00E9> de Laudonni<U+00E8>re|coauthors=Martin Basanier (ed.)|title=L'histoire Notable de la Floride ...

Auvray|year=1586}}</ref> The attention that the book excited in Paris encouraged Hakluyt to prepare an English translation and publish it in London under the title ''A Notable Historie Containing Foure Voyages Made by Certayne French Captaynes unto Florida'' (1587). The same year, his edition of [[Peter Martyr d'Anghiera]]'s ''De Orbe Nouo Decades Octo'' saw the light at Paris.<ref>At Hakluyt's recommendation, the work was translated into English by Michael Lok and published as {{cite book|author=Petrus Martyr Anglerius|authorlink=Peter Martyr d'Anghiera|title=De Nouo Orbe, or The Historie of the West Indies ...

==Return to England==

[[File:RichardHakluyt-PrincipallNavigations-1589-signature-closeup.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A manuscript signature of Hakluyt from the front flyleaf of the above work]]

In 1588 Hakluyt finally returned to England with [[Douglas Sheffield, Baroness Sheffield|Lady Stafford]], after a residence in France of nearly five years. In 1589 he published the first edition of his chief work, ''The Principall Navigations, Voiages and Discoveries of the English Nation'', using eyewitness accounts as far as possible. In the preface to this he announced the intended publication of the first [[globe#Terrestrial and planetary globes|terrestrial globe]] made in England by [[Emery Molyneux]]. Between 1598 and 1600 appeared the final, reconstructed and greatly-enlarged edition of ''The Principal Navigations, Voiages, Traffiques and Discoueries of the English Nation'' in three volumes. In the dedication of the second volume (1599) to his patron, [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Sir Robert Cecil]], he strongly urged the minister as to the expediency of colonizing Virginia.<ref name="Divers Voyages"/> A few copies of this monumental work contain a map of great rarity, the first on the [[Mercator projection]] made in England according to the true principles laid down by [[Edward Wright (mathematician)|Edward Wright]]. Hakluyt's great collection has been called "the Prose Epic of the modern English nation" by [[historian]] [[James Anthony Froude]].<ref>{{cite book|author=James Anthony Froude|authorlink=James Anthony Froude|title=Essays on History and Literature|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/18276|location=London|publisher=J.M. Dent & Co.|year=1906}}</ref>

On 20 April 1590 Hakluyt was instituted to the [[rectory]] of [[Wetheringsett-cum-Brockford]], [[Suffolk]], by Lady Stafford, who was [[dowager]] baroness Sheffield. He held this position until his death, and resided in Wetheringsett through the 1590s and frequently thereafter.<ref name="Galileo Project"/> In 1601 Hakluyt edited a translation from the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] of Antonio Galv<U+00E3>o's ''The Discoveries of the World''. In the same year<ref>[http://galileo.rice.edu/Catalog/NewFiles/hakluyt.html The Galileo Project] says this took place in 1599.</ref> his name occurs as an adviser to the [[British East India Company|East India Company]], in which capacity he supplied them with maps and informed them as to markets.

==Later life==
In the late 1590s Hakluyt became the client and personal chaplain of [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Sir Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury]], Lord Burghley's son, who was to be Hakluyt's most fruitful patron. Hakluyt dedicated to Cecil the second (1599) and third volumes (1600) of the expanded edition of ''Principal Navigations'' and also his edition of Galv<U+00E3>o's ''Discoveries'' (1601). Cecil, who was the principal [[Secretary of State (England)|Secretary of State]] to Elizabeth I and [[James I of England|James I]], rewarded him by installing him as [[prebendary]] of [[Westminster Abbey]] on 4 May 1602.<ref name="Galileo Project"/><ref>According to Jones's introduction to Hakluyt's ''Divers Voyages'', above, Hakluyt succeeded Dr. [[Richard Webster]] as prebendary of [[Westminster Abbey]] about 1605.</ref> In the following year, he was elected [[archdeacon]] of the Abbey.

Hakluyt was married twice, once in or about 1594<ref name="Divers Voyages"/> and again in 1604. In the licence of Hakluyt's second marriage dated 30 March 1604, he is described as one of the [[chaplain]]s of the [[Savoy Palace|Savoy Hospital]]; this position was also conferred on him by Cecil. His [[Will (law)|will]] refers to chambers occupied by him there up to the time of his death, and in another official document he is styled [[Doctor of Divinity]] (D.D.).<ref name="Encyclopaedia Britannica"/>

[[File:VirginiaCompanyofLondonSeal-1606-1624.png|thumb|left|250px|The seal of the Virginia Company of London]] 

Hakluyt was also a leading adventurer of the [[London Company|Charter of the Virginia Company of London]] as a director thereof in 1589.<ref name="Galileo Project"/> In 1605 he secured the prospective living of [[Jamestown, Virginia|James Town]], the intended capital of the intended [[colony]] of [[Virginia]]. When the colony was at last established in 1607, he supplied this [[benefice]] with its chaplain, [[Robert Hunt (chaplain)|Robert Hunt]]. In 1606 he appears as the chief promoter of the petition to James I for [[letters patent]] to colonize Virginia, which were granted on 10 April 1606.<ref name="Divers Voyages"/> His last publication was a translation of [[Hernando de Soto (explorer)|Hernando de Soto]]'s discoveries in Florida, entitled ''Virginia Richly Valued, by the Description of the Maine Land of Florida, Her Next Neighbour'' (1609). This work was intended to encourage the young colony of Virginia; Scottish [[historian]] [[William Robertson (historian)|William Robertson]] wrote of Hakluyt, "England is more indebted for its American possessions than to any man of that age."<ref>{{cite book|author=William Robertson|authorlink=William Robertson (historian)|title=The History of America|edition=10th|location=London|publisher=Strahan|year=1803}}</ref>

Hakluyt prepared an English translation of Dutch jurist [[Hugo Grotius]]' ''Mare Liberum'' (1609),<ref>{{cite book|author=Hugo Grotius|authorlink=Hugo Grotius|title=Mare Liberum, sive de jure quod Batavis competit ad Indicana commercia dissertatio [The Free Sea, or, A Dissertation on the Right which Belongs to the Batavians to Take Part in the East Indian Trade]|location=Leiden|publisher=Ex officina Ludovici Elzevirij &#91;From the office of [[Lodewijk Elzevir]]&#93;|year=1609}}</ref> a treatise that sought to demonstrate that the Dutch had the right to trade freely in the [[Indies]] contrary to Spanish and Portuguese claims of sovereignty over the seas,<ref name=JMR>{{cite journal|author=Helen Thornton|title=The Free Sea.

In that year, Hakluyt was a consultant to the Company when it was renewing its charter. Grotius' arguments supported England's right to trade in the Indies.<ref>Armitage, "Introduction", ''The Free Sea'': see Thornton, "The Free Sea [book review]".</ref> The translation may also have been part of the propaganda encouraging English people to settle in Virginia. In ''Mare Liberum'', Grotius denied that the 1493 donation by [[Pope Alexander VI]] that had divided the oceans between Spain and Portugal entitled Spain to make territorial claims to North America. Instead, he stressed the importance of occupation, which was favourable to the English as they and not the Spanish had occupied Virginia. Grotius also argued that the seas should be freely navigable by all, which was useful since the England to Virginia route crossed seas which the Portuguese claimed.<ref name=JMR/> However, it is not clear why Hakluyt's translation was not published in his lifetime. George Bruner Parks has theorized that publication at that time would have been inconvenient to England because after England had successfully helped Holland and Spain to negotiate the [[Twelve Years' Truce]] during the [[Eighty Years' War]], the work would have supported English claims for free seas against Spain, but not its claims for closed seas against Holland.<ref name=JMR/><ref>{{cite book|author=George Bruner Parks|title=Richard Hakluyt and the English Voyages [Special Publication American Geographical Society; no. 10]|location=New York, N.Y.|publisher=[[American Geographical Society]]|year=1928|pages=212}}</ref> Hakluyt's handwritten manuscript, MS Petyt 529, in [[Inner Temple Library]] in London was eventually published as ''[[The Free Sea]]'' for the first time in 2004.<ref name=Armitage/>

In 1591, Hakluyt inherited family property upon the death of his elder brother Thomas; a year later, upon the death of his youngest brother Edmund, he inherited another property which derived from his uncle. In 1612 Hakluyt became a charter member of the North-west Passage Company.<ref name="Galileo Project"/> By the time of his death, he had amassed a small fortune out of his various [[remuneration|emoluments]] and [[wikt:preferment|preferments]], of which the last was [[Gedney, Lincolnshire|Gedney]] Rectory, [[Lincolnshire]], presented to him by his younger brother Oliver in 1612. Unfortunately, his wealth was squandered by his only son.<ref name="Encyclopaedia Britannica"/>

Hakluyt is principally remembered for his efforts in promoting and supporting the settlement of North America by the English through his writings. These works were a fertile source of material for [[William Shakespeare]]<ref name="Cambridge History"/> and other authors. Hakluyt also encouraged the production of geographical and historical writings by others. It was at Hakluyt's suggestion that Robert Parke translated Juan Gonzalez de Mendoza's ''The History of the Great and Mighty Kingdom of China and the Situation Thereof'' (1588<U+2013>1590),<ref>An edition was published by the Hakluyt Society in the 19th century as {{cite book|author=Juan Gonzalez de Mendoza (comp.)|coauthors=Robert Parke (trans.); G.T.
