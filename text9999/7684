[[Maryland]] is a [[U.S. state]] with a musical heritage that dates back to the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] of the region and includes contributions to [[music history of the United States during the colonial era|colonial era music]], modern [[American popular music|American popular]] and [[American folk music|folk music]]. The '''music of Maryland''' includes a number of popular musicians, folk styles and a documented music history that dates to the colonial archives on music from [[Annapolis, Maryland|Annapolis]], an important source in research on colonial music. Famous modern musicians from Maryland range from jazz singer [[Billie Holiday]] to [[pop punk]] band [[Good Charlotte]], and include a wide array of popular styles.

Modern Maryland is home to many well-regarded music venues, including the [[Baltimore Symphony Orchestra]] and [[Baltimore Opera]], and the [[Peabody Institute]]'s Conservatory of Music. Baltimore, the largest city in the state, is home to many important local venues, such as the Red Room, a center for the local [[experimental music]] scene, and the [[house music|house]] nightspot Club Choices.<ref name = "Urbanite"/>  Outside of Baltimore, Frederick's [[Weinberg Center for the Arts]] and Rockville's [[Strathmore (Maryland)|Strathmore]] are also important regional venues. The [[Merriweather Post Pavilion]] and [[1st Mariner Arena]] host most of the largest concerts in the area. Since [[HFStival]] ended its successful run in 2006, [[Virgin Festival]] has taken over as one of the most popular summer festivals on the east coast since its inaugural year in 2006.

== Institutions ==
Most of the major musical organizations in Baltimore were founded by musicians who trained at the [[Peabody Institute]]'s Conservatory of Music.

== History ==
The documented music history of Maryland begins during the colonial era, in the 18th century. Prior to that, [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] lived in the state, but left behind few traces of their musical life. The city of Annapolis was a major center for music during the colonial era; the city's Tuesday Club left behind documentation of musical life in Annapolis, one of the most complete sources for musical knowledge about that era in the United States. The larger city of Baltimore eventually replaced Annapolis as a center for music in Maryland, and eventually became home to most of the prominent music institutions in the state, especially the [[Peabody Institute]]. Later still, Baltimore's Pennsylvania Avenue became a very well known home for [[African American music]], especially [[jazz]], while Maryland began producing popular musicians like [[The Orioles]]. In modern times, Maryland has been a home for styles including [[Emo (music)|emo]] and [[hardcore punk]].

=== Colonial era ===
There is little historical record of music in Maryland prior to the 18th century; the Native Americans of the area left little or no trace of their musical life. A few instruments, such as [[drum]]s and [[trumpet]]s, are known to have existed in the early history of the Maryland colony, probably as a functional means "of calling the populace to church or to market, or in serving as symbols for sea captains and those from the military"; some folk dancing and ballad singing is also substantiated by the historical record. The early colonists had little tradition of any performance art, due to the small number of individuals, their low standard of living and great poverty and disease.<ref name="early history">{{cite web|work=Maryland History and Culture|url=http://www.mdhc.org/bibliotest/essays.php?essay=20|accessdate=September 12, 2005|title=Music and Theater|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20050507153258/http://www.mdhc.org/bibliotest/essays.php?essay=20 |archivedate = May 7, 2005|deadurl=yes}} ''The few drums, trumpets, and other musical instruments recorded in seventeenth-century Maryland most likely played a functional role in calling the populace to church or to market, or in serving as symbols for sea captains and those from the military. A few references to ballad-singing and informal dancing pre-date 1700; there is no evidence of theatrical activities at this time.''</ref>

With the arrival of large numbers of [[slavery|slaves]], however, some white plantation owners earned enough wealth to invest in music and dance. The upper class used instruments like the [[flute]], [[violin]] and [[harpsichord]] and danced formal dances like the stately [[minuet]] or [[English country dance]], while the lower classes preferred [[reel (dance)|reels]] and [[jig]]s, accompanied by various kinds of [[guitar]]s, [[drum]]s, [[banjo]]s, [[transverse flute]]s and [[recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]]s, as well as, more rarely, [[hammered dulcimers]] and [[harpsichord]]s.<ref name = "colonial"/>

Local music groups during the colonial era did much to sponsor musical development. Annapolis, a major center for colonial music in North America, was home to the Homony Club and the Tuesday Club, while the [[Freemason]]s held balls and concerts across Maryland. Unlike the northern United States, religious music did not prosper in Maryland until the end of the colonial period, and then only in Baltimore in the German communities of [[Carroll County, Maryland|Carroll]], [[Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery]] and [[Frederick County, Maryland|Frederick]] countries.<ref name="colonial">{{cite web|url=http://www.colonialmusic.org/Resource/StudyMD.htm|title=Study Guide for the "Music of Colonial Maryland" Program|work=Colonial Music Institute|accessdate=August 26, 2005}}</ref> Tavern owners frequently sponsored dances and concerts during the colonial era. Beginning in 1752, theater became a major part of Maryland culture for colonists of all classes; performances included light dance and incidental music, [[ballad opera]]s and the works of [[William Shakespeare]].<ref name="MD">{{cite web|work=Maryland History and Culture|url=http://www.mdhc.org/bibliotest/essays.php?essay=20|accessdate=September 12, 2005|title=Music and Theater|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20050507153258/http://www.mdhc.org/bibliotest/essays.php?essay=20 |archivedate = May 7, 2005|deadurl=yes}}David K.

=== Early independence and 19th century ===
Professional theater in Maryland died out during the Revolution but was reestablished by 1780, now with Baltimore having replaced Annapolis as a cultural capital in the state.<ref name="MD">{{cite web|work=Maryland History and Culture|url=http://www.mdhc.org/bibliotest/essays.php?essay=20|accessdate=September 12, 2005|title=Music and Theater|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20050507153258/http://www.mdhc.org/bibliotest/essays.php?essay=20 |archivedate = May 7, 2005|deadurl=yes}} ''Although the fear of war forced theater troupes to leave Maryland by 1774, theatrical activities resumed with renewed vigor in the early 1780s in Baltimore, the new state's post-Revolutionary cultural capital.''</ref> Maryland ratified the Constitution on April 28, 1788 and became the 7th state. The Holiday Street Theater in Baltimore opened in 1793 and was one of the first large theaters in the country, showcasing light theater, opera, and concerts. In 1822, [[Arthur Clifton]] from Baltimore debuted his opera ''The Enterprise'', while religious music flourished after the 1821 opening of the Catholic Cathedral in the country. The [[African Methodist Episcopal]] churches in Maryland were home to singing traditions using the [[shape-note]] method.<ref name = "MD"/>

By the turn of the century, the middle classes of Maryland were holding regular dances featuring the [[cotillion]], [[quadrille]], [[schottische]], [[polka]] and [[waltz]]. Eastern European dances were also popular, brought by immigrants from various countries. Many immigrants in Maryland moved to Baltimore, forming their own distinct neighborhoods with German [[List of German expressions in English|liederkranz]] singing societies, and Irish [[St. Patrick's Day]] parades and Jewish chants flourished among their respective communities. Maryland was home to several folk traditions, including the [[work song]]s of rail and canal diggers and the crab- and oystermen of the Chesapeake Bay, whose repertoire varied from hymns to risqu<U+00E9> songs and [[music of the Bahamas|Bahaman shanties]].<ref name = "MD"/>

By the middle of the 19th century, Baltimore was a major center of sheet music publishing, home to [[Joseph Carr]], [[F. D. Benteen]], [[John Cole (music publisher)|John Cole]] and [[George Willig]], as well as the piano-building businesses of [[William Knabe]] and [[Charles Stieff]]. This period also saw the rise of [[blackface]] [[minstrel show]]s, featuring the pseudo-African American songs of composers like [[Dan Emmett]] and [[Stephen Foster]].<ref name = "MD"/>

During the Civil War, Maryland was a [[border states (Civil War)|border state]], home to people who sympathized with both sides of the conflict. Federal troops occupied Baltimore, and some people who wrote music that favored the Confederacy were jailed; these pieces included "The Confederacy March", "Stonewall Jackson's Way" and "[[Maryland, My Maryland]]", the last later becoming Maryland's [[state song]]. The Civil War left several lasting effects on American music nationwide, most importantly the normalization of white and black cultural mixing, especially in music, caused by the mixing of soldiers in multiracial units; military [[brass band]]s became a popular part of the music scene during and after the war, one of the first being the Moxley Band from [[Frederick, Maryland|Frederick]].<ref name = "MD"/>

The middle of the 19th century saw a wave of immigration from Europe into the United States, including a large number of German musicians who settled in Baltimore; the presence of these musicians, as well as the general growth in urban population with the [[industrial revolution]] and the continued rise of the music publishing industry, helped make music training more affordable for more Americans.<ref name = "MD"/>

[[Image:PeabodyInstitute.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Peabody Institute]] in Baltimore in about 1902]]

[[Music school|Conservatories]], institutes of music education, were introduced to the United States in the mid to late 19th century, beginning with Baltimore's [[Peabody Institute]]'s [[Peabody Conservatory of Music|Conservatory of Music]], founded in 1857. The Peabody trained numerous musicians who went on to found most of Baltimore's major musical organizations, including the [[Baltimore Opera]], [[Baltimore Choral Arts]] and the [[Baltimore Symphony Orchestra]]. Though founded in 1857, the Peabody Institute did not hold an orchestral concert until after the Civil War, when [[James Monroe Deems]] directed a concert; Deems was a musician and composer, known for ''Nebuchadnezzar'', one of the first American [[oratorio]]s. He was succeeded by [[Lucien Southard]], who failed to organize the Institute (then known as the ''Academy of Music''), blaming the lack of a "proper musical atmosphere" in Baltimore. It was not until [[Asger Hamerik]]'s reign that the Peabody Symphony Orchestra finally became successful, one of only five professional orchestras in the country at the time. Hamerik was an advocate of American music and regularly included the works of American composers, eschewing the more typical European programs.<ref name = "MD"/>

The Peabody during Hamerik's leadership produced such noted individuals as [[Otto Sutro]], publisher, music store owner and host of a music society called the Wednesday Club, and with fellow Peabody alum Fritz Finke, founder of the Oratorio Society. In 1871, Ford's Grand Opera House opened, followed three years later by the [[Academy of Music (Baltimore)|Academy of Music]]; this new ''Academy of Music'' shared the name with the Peabody Institute's organization, but in the same year changed to the ''Conservatory of Music''. The Academy's conductor, [[Adam Itzel, Jr.]] was a very popular composer, known for the national hit light opera ''The Tar and the Tartar''.<ref name = "MD"/>

=== Early 20th century ===
There were a number of mostly informal musical societies in Maryland by the end of the 19th century, including the famous Saturday Night Club of [[H. L. Mencken]] and the influential [[Florestan Club]], which hosted such musicians as [[Mischa Elman]], [[Leopold Stokowski]] and [[Walter Damrosch]]. The [[Baltimore Symphony Orchestra]] was the first permanent orchestra in the city since 1895, when the Peabody Orchestra dissolved; it opened in 1916 with conductor [[Gustav Strube]]; this came only three year's after the formation of the short-lived Baltimore Opera Society, which was eventually replaced by the [[Baltimore Opera]] in 1927.<ref name = "MD"/>

While the largely white middle- and upper-class Baltimoreans supported the orchestras and other societies, the city's African Americans formed their own Coloured Symphony Orchestra in 1931, which was municipally supported just like the BSO; the first performance included [[Ellis Larkins]] and [[Anne Brown]], the latter known for creating the role of Bess in ''[[Porgy and Bess]]''. At the time, Pennsylvania Avenue (often known simply as ''The Avenue'') was the major scene for Baltimore's black musicians, and was an early home for [[Eubie Blake]] and [[Noble Sissle]], among others.<ref name="MD">{{cite web|work=Maryland History and Culture|url=http://www.mdhc.org/bibliotest/essays.php?essay=20|accessdate=September 12, 2005|title=Music and Theater|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20050507153258/http://www.mdhc.org/bibliotest/essays.php?essay=20 |archivedate = May 7, 2005|deadurl=yes}}</ref>

== Folk music ==
Maryland's folk music heritage remains little studied. There have been no major musicological studies in Maryland, though some [[Anglo-American music|Anglo-American]] and [[African American music|African American folk songs]] have been documented. The [[Library of Congress]]' [[American Folklife Center]] has a library of recorded Maryland folk music, which includes a wide array of songs and styles, including [[the Bahamas|Bahamanian]] [[spiritual (music)|spirituals]], [[music of Mexico|Mexican music]], African American [[blues]], [[Appalachian folk music]], [[steelpan]] and [[gospel music]], and [[Piscataway Indian Nation|Piscataway]] [[Native American music]].<ref name="LOC">{{cite web|work=American Heritage Center|title=Maryland Field Recordings in the Archive of Folk Culture|url=http://www.loc.gov/folklife/guides/Maryland.html|accessdate=November 3, 2005}}</ref> Maryland's folk heritage also includes the traditional [[music of Germany|music of the German communities]] of central and western Maryland. [[Cornet]] bands, such as the [[Rohrersville Cornet Band]], are also a prominent part of Maryland's folk heritage.

The oystermen and others who work on the Chesapeake Bay have their own distinct folk song styles which include [[hymn]]s and [[work song]]s. Some locally popular performers have used these folk themes in their music, including [[Bob Zentz]] and [[Steve Keith]], all of whom have appeared on records by the Annapolis Maritime Museum's Chesapeake Music Institute. The [[Piedmont blues]], a style of [[blues]] music, is most closely associated with the [[music of Virginia]], [[music of North Carolina|North Carolina]], [[music of Georgia|Georgia]] and [[music of South Carolina|South Carolina]], but also exists in Maryland, which has produced modern performers like [[Warner Williams and Jay Summerour]]. Bill Jackson, born 1906, from [[Granite, Maryland]] was an obscure Piedmont blues guitarist and singer. He was discovered by [[Pete Welding]] and recorded his first and only record in 1962. The Piedmont blues arose from a mixture of black [[gospel music]] with white string ensembles, and is characterized by a style of guitar playing influenced by [[ragtime]] and [[country music]].<ref name="BaltimoreCityPaper">{{cite web|accessdate=September 21, 2005|work=Baltimore City Paper|title=Thin Blue Line |url=http://www.citypaper.com/music/story.asp?id=7419}}</ref>

== Popular music ==
[[Image:Billie Holiday 1949.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Billie Holiday was a famous jazz singer who grew up in [[Fells Point]], Baltimore.]]
Maryland has produced popular musicians from many fields, including [[doo wop]] and hardcore punk, as well as the [[gangsta rap]] of [[Tupac Shakur]], the contemporary [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] of [[Toni Braxton]] and the pop of [[Cass Elliott]]. Though doo wop can be traced to many urban areas across the United States, especially New York City, [[Sonny Til]]'s 1946 band called The Vibranaires, later known as [[The Orioles]], can be considered the first doo wop group.<ref name="Garofolo">{{cite book | last = Garofalo | first = Reebee | title = Rockin' Out: Popular Music in the USA | year = 1997 | publisher = Allyn and Bacon|isbn = 0-205-13703-2}}</ref>  The genre-crossing [[Frank Zappa]] was also from Maryland, as was [[Tupac Shakur]], who was born in [[Harlem]], though he began his career in Baltimore, eventually becoming one of the most famous rappers in [[history of hip hop music|hip hop history]]. Maryland has also produced many renowned jazz musicians, such as [[Eubie Blake]], [[Elmer Snowden]] and [[Billie Holiday]].  ''The Urbanite'' magazine describes Baltimore jazz as variously a wildly varying array of styles or a "hard bop town, where R&B, gospel and bebop meet";<ref name="Urbanite2">''The Urbanite'' The varying styles claim is cited to Andy Bienstock of WYPR, while the "hard bop town" is attributed to Benny Russell of the Maryland Conservatory of Music's Jazz Department</ref> during the middle of the 20th century, Baltimore produced a vibrant local jazz tradition characterized by the use of the [[Hammond B-3|B3]] [[organ (musical instrument)|organ]]. Many modern Baltimorean jazz musicians are renowned saxophonists, including [[Gary Thomas (musician)|Gary Thomas]], [[Gary Bartz]] and the Afro-Caribbean influenced [[TK Blue]]. Internationally acclaimed jazz ensemble [[Fertile Ground]] lead by Baltimore native [[James H. Collins Jr.]] are also based in Baltimore. Famed [[Talking Heads]] lead singer [[David Byrne (musician)|David Byrne]] lived in Baltimore. [[Jimmie's Chicken Shack]], [[Good Charlotte]], [[All Time Low]], and [[O.A.R.]] are other popular American rock bands with strong ties to Maryland.

Mama [[Cass Elliot]] of [[The Mamas & the Papas]] was from Maryland, and began her singing career there. Another Maryland band similar to the Mamas and Papas, the [[Peppermint Rainbow]], was discovered by Mama Cass and had a top forty hit with the song "Will you be staying after Sunday". Maryland-based band [[The Ravyns]] are also notable for having their song "Raised on the Radio" appear on the soundtrack to ''[[Fast Times at Ridgemont High]]''. The [[Dundalk, Maryland|Dundalk]]-based [[Chorus of the Chesapeake]] won [[List of chorus champions by year|international championships]] in 1961 and 1971.

Baltimore's [[hardcore punk]] scene has been overshadowed by DC's, but included locally renowned bands like Law & Order, Bollocks, OTR, and Fear of God; many of these bands played at bars like the Marble Bar, Terminal 406 and the illegal space Jule's Loft, which author Steven Blush described as the "apex of the Baltimore (hardcore) scene" in 1983 and 1984. The 1980s also saw the development of a local [[New Wave music|New Wave]] scene led by the bands Ebeneezer & the Bludgeons, Null Set, and Here Today (later [[Vigil (band)]]). Later in the decade, [[emo (music)|emo]] bands like [[Reptile House]] and [[Grey March]] had some success and recorded with [[Ian MacKaye]] in DC.<ref name="Blush">{{cite book | last = Blush | first = Steven | year = 2001 | title = American Hardcore: A Tribal History | publisher = Feral House|isbn = 0-922915-71-7}}</ref>  Some early Baltimore punk musicians moved onto other local bands by the end of the 1990s, resulting in local mainstays [[Lungfish (band)|Lungfish]] and [[Fascist Fascist]], who became regionally prominent.  ''The Urbanite'' magazine has identified several major trends in local Baltimorean music, including the rise of psychedelic-folk singer-songwriters like [[Entrance (musician)|Entrance]] and the house/hip hop dance fusion called [[Baltimore club]], pioneered by DJs like [[Rod Lee]]. More recently, Baltimore's indie rock scene has produced performers like [[Slot Racer]], [[Cass McCombs]] and [[Mary Prankster]].<ref name="Urbanite">{{cite web|work=The Urbanite|title=Soundtrack to the City|url=http://www.urbanitebaltimore.com/februaryMagazine/soundtrack.html|accessdate=November 3, 2005|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20051231041937/http://www.urbanitebaltimore.com/februaryMagazine/soundtrack.html |archivedate = December 31, 2005|deadurl=yes}}</ref>

Maryland has had a thriving [[doom metal]] scene since the early 90s, and is now considered to have its own "Maryland doom" sound.<ref>[http://www.metal-invader.com/db/reviews-1194.html Metal Invader]</ref> This scene was started in the late 70s with [[The Obsessed]], a band led by [[Scott Weinrich|Scott "Wino" Weinrich]]. During this time, [[Northern Virginia]]'s [[Pentagram (band)|Pentagram]] also had a heavy influence on the Maryland scene. After disbanding The Obsessed in the mid 80s and moving to California to sing with doom legends [[Saint Vitus (band)|Saint Vitus]], Wino reformed The Obsessed and signed to the German based [[Hellhound Records]].
