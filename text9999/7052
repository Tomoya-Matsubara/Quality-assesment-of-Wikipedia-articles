The Prisoner of War Medal 1940<U+2013>1945 was a 38&nbsp;mm in diameter circular bronze medal surmounted by a three dimensional 25&nbsp;mm high royal crown mounted on a pin giving the entire assembly (medal and crown) a height of 64&nbsp;mm.  The [[obverse]] bore a [[broadsword]] pointing down superimposed over a [[cross|Greek cross]] with slightly flared ends and bisecting the years "1940" and "1945" inscribed in relief on the lateral cross arms.  Two triangular laurel leaves protrude from between the cross arms fanning out.  A ring of barbed wire encircles the cross along the entire circumference 3mm from the medal's edge.  The reverse bore a guard tower and prison camp fence surrounded by a chain along the entire circumference 3mm from the medal's edge.<ref name="decree"/>

The medal was suspended by a ring through the crown's orb from a 37&nbsp;mm wide black silk [[moir<U+00E9>]] ribbon with narrow longitudinal 1&nbsp;mm red/black/yellow/black/red stripes 2&nbsp;mm from the edges.  Years of imprisonment were denoted on the ribbon by small striated metal bars.<ref name="decree"/>
