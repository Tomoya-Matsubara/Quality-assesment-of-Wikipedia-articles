'''Michael Alfred "Mike" Warnke''' (born November 19, 1946, in [[Evansville, Indiana]]) is a [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Evangelism|evangelist]] and [[comedian]] who became one of evangelical Christianity's best-known experts on the subject of [[Satanism]] before his story of having been a Satanist high priest was debunked in 1991 by the Christian magazine ''[[Cornerstone (magazine)|Cornerstone]]''.

==Early life==
Warnke was the son of Alfred "Al" Warnke and Louise Warnke. When he was five years old, the family moved to [[Manchester, Tennessee]], where Al opened a [[truck stop]]. In 1955, Warnke's mother was killed in a car accident. In 1958 his father died, leaving Mike an [[orphan]]. Mike was first taken to live with two of his aunts in [[Sparta, Tennessee]], and from there to his father's half-sister and her husband in [[San Bernardino County, California|San Bernardino]], [[California]]. He graduated from [[Rim of the World High School]] in [[Lake Arrowhead, California|Lake Arrowhead]] in June 1965. In September, he enrolled at [[San Bernardino Valley College]] but withdrew after one semester, whereupon, by his account, he began his tenure as a Satanist. On June 2, 1966, Warnke enlisted in the [[United States Navy]] as a hospital corpsman.<ref name=cornerstone-expose>{{cite web|url = http://www.cornerstonemag.com/features/iss098/sellingsatan.htm |title = Selling Satan |work = Cornerstone |issue=98 |year=1992}}</ref>

According to Warnke's account in ''The Satan Seller'', his religious experience came during his tenure in the Navy, on August 27, 1966, and he [[Conversion to Christianity|converted to Christianity]] (an account later proven to be a lie).  Returning from [[recruit training]], Warnke began dating fellow Rim High alumna Sue Studer. The following year, Warnke completed his naval medic training and returned to [[San Diego]], where he married Studer.  In 1969, Warnke was sent to [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] for a six-month tour of duty<ref name=cornerstone-vietnam>''Cornerstone'', issue 98: "Records show Warnke was in Vietnam for only six months"</ref> where he won a [[Purple Heart]], but spent much time detained, allegedly killed a man, and was shot several times. He returned to the United States in 1970.<ref name=cornerstone-expose/>

While still in the service of the Navy, Warnke teamed up with San Diego [[Evangelism|evangelist]] [[Morris Cerullo]] and was touted for his "Satanist experience". Warnke and Cerullo toured the country participating in charismatic [[Revival meeting]]s. Cerullo wanted to write a book about youth occultism, and assigned the writing task to David Balsiger with help from Warnke. In early 1972, Warnke requested and received an early discharge from the Navy as a [[conscientious objector]] so that he could work full-time in the ministry. Warnke then left Cerullo's ministry to start his own, forbidding Cerullo to use any of his material, and he and Balsiger went on to write the book that would make Warnke famous.<ref name=cornerstone-expose/>

==Rise to fame==
===''The Satan Seller''===
In 1973, Warnke's book ''The Satan Seller'' was released. It was written by Warnke with help from Balsiger and [[Les Jones]] and tells of Warnke's orphaned childhood and his introduction into Satanism.  It details Warnke's participation in sexual orgies, alcoholism, and drug dealing; his rise in the ranks of Satanism to the level of "high priest"; presiding over Satanic rituals including magical spells, summoning demons, ritual sex including a ritual kidnap and rape; the attempt on his life &mdash; a [[heroin]] [[overdose]] &mdash; that left him angry and disillusioned; his heroism in [[Vietnam]]; and how he found Jesus and came home as an evangelist. The story ends with Warnke living happily in California with wife Sue Studer. In fewer than three months after the release, ''The Satan Seller'' had become a religious best-seller.<ref name=cornerstone-expose/>

The book launched Warnke into stardom within [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] Christian communities. He became a popular speaker at Christian meeting places such as [[Melodyland]] in [[Anaheim, California|Anaheim]], [[California]].  In 1974, Warnke moved his family to attend Trinity Bible College in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma|Tulsa]], [[Oklahoma]], for a nine-month preparation for ministry. It was here that among other [[Charismatic movement|charismatic]] Christians and recent converts preparing for a life of ministry, Warnke met Carolyn Alberty, with whom Warnke began an affair.<ref name=cornerstone-expose/><!-- LEAVE CITATION IN--> Warnke also met Elijah Coady, an [[episcopi vagantes|independent, schismatic bishop]] of the Syro-Chaldean Church, also known as the [[Assyrian Church of the East]]. Coady [[ordained]] Warnke as a [[deacon]]. Upon graduation, Warnke was again ordained, and Warnke moved with his family to [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]], [[Colorado]].<ref name=cornerstone-expose/>

===Recordings and wives===
In November 1975 at an [[Indiana]] [[coffeehouse]], Warnke's talk about his conversion from Satanism to Christianity was incidentally recorded. This recording became Warnke's first [[album]], ''Alive'', which was soon widely played on [[Christian radio]].{{Fact|date=March 2007}} Later that same year, despite interventions from pastors and other acclaimed ministers, Warnke left Sue for Carolyn and filed for divorce. Four months after the divorce was finalized in December, Warnke married Carolyn.<ref name=cornerstone-expose/>

Warnke's popularity earned him the cover of the September 1976 issue of ''Harmony'', a prominent Christian magazine in the 1970s. In 1977, Warnke released his second album, ''Jester In The King's Court''.  In 1978, Warnke recounted his Vietnam experiences on his third album, ''Hey, Doc!''. His albums became "the most popular [[Christian comedy]] albums ever produced".<ref name=ccm>As quoted in ''Cornerstone'' issue 98: {{ citation |title = When Mike Warnke Speaks, the World Listens! |periodical = Contemporary Christian Music |date = 1979-02-26}}</ref> During a tour to [[Hazard, Kentucky|Hazard]], [[Kentucky]], Warnke met Rose Hall, a thrice-divorced mother of three, and began courting her while still married to and together with Carolyn. That marriage came to an end when, as ''Cornerstone'' quotes<ref name=cornerstone-expose/><!-- DO NOT REMOVE CITATION-->  Carolyn: "[Warnke] threw me into a wall and split my head open. He said, 'If you go to a local hospital and tell them what your name is, I'll kill you.'" Carolyn fled to Florida. By November 1979, their divorce was final, and Mike moved to Rose's farm in Kentucky. On January 2, 1980, Warnke and Rose married.<ref name=cornerstone-expose/> 

Warnke and his label, [[Word Records]], feuded over an album which he eventually produced and distributed on his own, ''A Christian's Perspective on Halloween '' (1979). Word Records and Warnke reconciled by 1981,{{Fact|date=March 2007}} resulting in ''Coming Home'' (1981), and now including wife Rose, ''Higher Education'' (1982) and ''Growing Up'' (1983).  Then under Word's [[DaySpring Records|Dayspring]] label, he released (solo) ''Stuff Happens'' (1985), ''Good News Tonight'' (1986), ''One In A Million'' (1988), ''Live ... Totally Weird'' (1989).<ref

During the 1980s, Warnke's and Rose's ministry prospered, as they toured and performed together and raised millions of dollars for their ministry; contributions to the ministry were over $1 million in 1985, and over $2 million in each year from 1987 through 1990.<ref name=cornerstone-expose/><!--facts checked; Cornerstone obtained HOCCK filings and cited them in article {{Fact|date=March 2007}}--> As the Warnke's popularity waxed, their personal relationship waned. In 1984, Rose wrote "Satan provided a woman to fill the gap in Michael's life."<ref name="great-pretender">As cited by ''Cornerstone'' expose: {{ cite book |author = Rose Hall Warnke |coauthors = Joan Hake Robie |isbn = 0914984039 | title = The Great Pretender |location= Lancaster, PA |publisher = Starburst Publishers | year = 1985}}</ref> They separated in 1989 and divorced in 1991. Six weeks after the divorce was finalized, Warnke married former Rim High alum and current wife, Susan Patton.<ref name=cornerstone-expose/> 

===Extravagant claims===
In 1982, Warnke began to exaggerate his achievements. For instance, during the 1980s Warnke's claims of academic degrees increased from two [[Bachelor's degree]]s to two [[Master's Degree]]s to a [[Doctorate of Philosophy]].<!--As stated on Higher Education {{Fact|date=March 2007}} -->  In ''The Satan Seller'', Warnke claims to have been wounded twice while in Vietnam. In ''Hitchhiking on Hope Street'', that number was raised to five.<ref name=cornerstone-expose/> Warnke followed up his interest in the [[Syro-Chaldean]] tradition and his 1978/1979 ordination as a deacon with a 1983 ordination by independent bishop Richard Morrill, lately of the Byzantine Catholic Church, Inc. This allowed Warnke to call himself a bishop.<ref name=cornerstone-expose/>

===National exposure===
Warnke received national coverage when he appeared on the first major news report on Satanism (broadcast in May 16 1985), by [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]<U+2019>s ''[[20/20]]''. In the report titled "The Devil Worshippers", Warnke appeared in a number of different segments discussing the implements and clothing used in Satanic ceremonies, a scar allegedly indicating where he was repeatedly cut so that his blood could be used in Satanic ceremonies, and what drew him to Satanism.<ref name="ABC">{{cite news |title = The Devil Worshippers |work =  |publisher = ABC News 20/20 transcript, show #521 |date = May 16, 1985}}</ref> After Warnke's appearance on ''20/20'', he became a well-paid expert on Satanism.{{Fact|date=March 2007}} He was frequently cited as an expert on the [[occult]] by Christian radio host [[Bob Larson]] and the [[Chick Publications]] stable of authors.

==Investigation, debunking and disgrace==
In 1991, ''[[Cornerstone (magazine)|Cornerstone]]'' magazine launched an investigation into Warnke's life and testimony. The previous year, that magazine had debunked the story recounted in ''[[Satan's Underground]]'', by [[Laurel Rose Willson|Lauren Stratford]] who claimed her deep involvement in Satanism led her to partake in a ritual in which her own child was [[human sacrifice|sacrificed]]. After this expos<U+00E9>, which showed that Stratford's alleged child never existed, ''Cornerstone'' journalists [[Mike Hertenstein]] and [[Jon Trott]] investigated Warnke. They investigated Warnke's life, from interviews with over 100 personal friends and acquaintances, to his ministry's tax receipts. Their investigation turned up damaging evidence of fraud and deceit. 

The investigation revealed pictures of Warnke taken during the precise time of his alleged status as a Satanist priest. Instead of an emaciated drug-addict sporting long fingernails and waist-length hair, the pictures showed Warnke to be a typical 'square' of the mid-1960s. The investigation refuted, for instance, Warnke's claims that he and mass-murderer [[Charles Manson]] had attended a Satanic ritual &mdash; Manson was in federal prison at the time (and had no known ties to any Satanic churches).  It uncovered that before even joining the Navy, where Warnke claims to have converted, he had been involved with a college Christian ministry, [[Campus Crusade for Christ]]. The investigation also revealed the unflattering circumstances surrounding Warnke's multiple marriages, affairs, and divorces. <!-- , facts unknown to the general public.{{cn|date=February 2008}} (okay, no doubt we don't need to cite the investigation, but how do we know these facts were unknown to the general public. sounds like OR) --> Most critically, however, the investigation showed how Warnke could not possibly have done the many things he claimed to have done throughout the alleged nine months he was a Satanist, much less become a drug-addicted dealer or a Satanic high priest.<ref name=cornerstone-dates>{{cite web|url = http://www.cornerstonemag.com/features/iss098/dates.htm |title = Why the Dates Don't Work (sidebar) |work = Cornerstone |issue=98 |year=1992}}</ref>

<!-- (Warnke made no attempt to disprove the charges. (not untrue, but misleading.) -->
Before publishing the article, ''Cornerstone'' contacted Warnke for an interview, but he and ''Cornerstone'' could not agree to the terms of an interview.<ref name=warnke-response>{{ cite web |url = http://www.cornerstonemag.com/features/iss098/warnke_response/csr0009a.htm |date=1992-07-15 |title = Warnke's statement in response to Cornerstone's claims |work = Cornerstone}} </ref><ref name=cornerstone-update/> In June 1992, at the annual Christian Booksellers' Association convention, ''Cornerstone'' revealed its story.  

===Aftermath===
Warnke sent a response to ''Cornerstone'',<ref name=warnke-response/> published in July, insisting he told the truth, stating:
{{blockquote|I stand by my testimony of being delivered and set free by the power of Jesus Christ after being a Satanic high priest exactly as published in my book, ''The Satan Seller''.... some information was purposefully changed to protect the privacy of certain individuals and to prevent readers from using the book as a guide for occultism and Satanic purposes.  But, as we stated in the front of the book, 'The events are absolutely as described.'}} Despite these assertions, Warnke did not provide the name of a single Satanist but used invectives against ex-wife Carolyn.<ref name=warnke-response/>  In the ensuing months, Warnke conceded parts of the allegations, telling ''Christianity Today'' that there had been only 13 members of his coven, not 1,500 as originally claimed, and that of those 13, the whereabouts of five were unknown to him, while the other eight had since died.<ref name="lied">Jay Grelen. "Christian comedian says he lied about coven," ''[[Lexington Herald-Leader]]'', November 3, 1992, page B1.</ref>

Public response was varied, but nevertheless overwhelmingly against Warnke.<ref name=cornerstone-update>{{cite web|url = http://www.cornerstonemag.com/features/iss099/warnke_update.htm |title = Warnke Update |issue=99 |work = Cornerstone |year=1992}}</ref>  Initially, Word Records stated they would stand by their artist. However, further investigations by local Kentucky reporters at the ''[[Lexington Herald-Leader]]'' revealed that Warnke's ministry had engaged in financial misdeeds and that "Mike, his ex-wife Rose, and her brother Neale [Hall] received a total of $809,680 in salary at a time when the ministry newsletter claimed donations were down and more funds were needed."<ref name=cornerstone-update/> One week later, Word Records dropped Warnke from its label.  Finally, on September 30, 1992, fewer than 100 days after the investigation was made public, Warnke Ministries closed its doors.<ref name="grelen">Jay Grelen. "Christian comedian set to close doors of troubled ministry," ''[[Lexington Herald-Leader]]'' (KY), September 30, 1992, page C13.</ref>

In the spring of 1993, Warnke submitted to the authority of an assembly of ministers "acting as elders," acknowledging his "ungodliness," his "multiple divorces," his "failure as husband, father, and friend", and of "embellishment and exaggeration ... in an attempt ... to entertain," and offering to pay [[back taxes]] to the federal government. The group recommended specific changes to the ministry, including a [[salary cap]] and accountability reports.<ref name="okla2000">Tamie Ross. "Laughs stopped for Christian comic: Mike Warnke offers fans new outlook after ministry's crash," ''The Daily Oklahoman'', September 30, 2000, page 1B</ref> Nonetheless, he continued to "stand by [his] testimony of former Satanic involvement"<ref name=warnke-apology>Warnke's [http://www.mikewarnke.org/packet22.html 1993 statement of apology and repentance]</ref> stating in an 2000 interview with the ''[[Daily Oklahoman]]'', "Exaggeration did creep into some of my stories, but my testimony is still my testimony."<ref name="okla2000"/><ref name="modesto">"Local notes - Controversial comedian," ''[[The Modesto Bee]]'' (CA), February 2, 2002, page G1: ''"Mike Warnke, a popular 1970s Christian comedian later accused of fabricating claims about his Satanist past, will speak at Pentecostal Church of God Friday through February 10. ... It is unlikely he will talk about his colorful past, said Hughson Pastor Roy Little.
