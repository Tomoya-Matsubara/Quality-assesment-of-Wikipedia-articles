'''Nicholas John Griffin''' (born 1 March 1959) is a British politician, chairman of the [[far right]] [[British National Party]] and a Member of the [[European Parliament]] for [[North West England (European Parliament constituency)|North West England]].  He is married with four children, and lives in Wales.

Griffin was born in Barnet, London, and was educated in Suffolk.  He joined the [[British National Front|National Front]] aged 15, and following his graduation from [[Cambridge University]] became a political worker for the party. In 1980 he became a member of its governing body, and later wrote articles for right-wing magazines. He was the party's candidate for the seat of [[Croydon North West (UK Parliament constituency)|Croydon North West]] in 1981 and 1983.  Griffin left the National Front in 1989, and in 1995 joined the British National Party, becoming its leader in 1999.  He stood as the party's candidate in several elections, and in 2009 was elected as a member of the European Parliament for North West England in the [[European Parliament election, 2009|2009 European Elections]].

In 1998 Griffin was convicted of distributing material likely to incite racial hatred, for which he received a suspended prison sentence.  He was charged in 2005 with inciting racial hatred, but following a retrial was cleared.  Griffin has been criticised for his comments on political and religious matters, his [[Holocaust denial]] and anti-semitic articles, although since becoming leader of the BNP he has distanced himself from these opinions.  He is a strong critic of aspects of Islam.  Over the years several educational institutions have invited him to speak on matters including political radicalism, multiculturalism, and BNP policy.

In 1977, Griffin went to [[Downing College, Cambridge]], where he studied History and Law.<ref name="bbcprofile"/> During a union debate his affiliation to the National Front was revealed, and his photograph was published in a student newspaper.  Undeterred, he later founded the Young National Front Student organisation.  He graduated with a [[British undergraduate degree classification|2:2 degree]] and a [[University Sporting Blue|boxing blue]], having taken up the sport following a brawl with an anti-fascist in Lewisham.<ref name="Guardianprofile">{{Citation|last = Siddique | first = Haroon | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2008/nov/19/bnp-leader-nick-griffin |title=Profile: Nick Griffin |publisher=guardian.co.uk|date= 2008-11-19|accessdate=2009-02-27}}</ref>  Griffin boxed three times against Oxford in the annual Varsity match, winning twice and losing once.

==Political career==
===1970s&ndash;1990===
Following his graduation, Griffin became a political worker at the National Front headquarters.<ref name="Guardianprofile"/>   As a teenager he had accompanied his father to a [[British National Front|National Front]] meeting,<ref name="bbcprofile"/><ref>{{Citation | title = Nick Griffin: Right-wing chameleon | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1412785.stm | date = 2001-06-29 | publisher = news.bbc.co.uk | accessdate = 2009-06-15}}</ref> and by 1978, he was a national organiser for the party.<ref name="telegraphprofile"/>  He helped set up the White Noise Music Club in 1979,<ref>{{Harvnb|Ware|Back|2002|p=101}}</ref> and several years later worked with [[white power skinhead]] band, [[Skrewdriver]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Goodrick-Clarke|2003|p=194}}</ref>  In 1980 he became a member of the party's governing body, the National Directorate, <!-- and also set up the National Front Student Organisation (possibly same organisation as already mentioned)-->and in the same year launched ''Nationalism Today'' with the aid of [[Joseph Pearce|Joe Pearce]], then editor of the NF youth paper ''Bulldog''.<ref>{{Citation | last = Barberis | first = P. | title = "National Front" in ''Encyclopaedia of British and Irish political Organizations: Parties, Groups and Movements of the Twentieth Century'' | year = 2000 | page = 639 | publisher = Continuum International}}</ref><ref>{{Citation | title = Violence In Our Minds | url = http://web.archive.org/web/20070927212523/http://www.skinheadnation.co.uk/tilburyskinheads.htm | publisher = skinheadnation.co.uk | accessdate = 2009-06-16}}</ref>  As a member of the National Front Griffin contested the seat of Croydon North West twice, in 1981 and 1983.<ref name="Thurrock">{{Citation | title = UK Polling Report - Thurrock | url = http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/guide/seat-profiles/thurrock | publisher = ukpollingreport.co.uk | accessdate = 2009-06-17}}</ref>

The National Front had, since the election of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] under [[Margaret Thatcher]], seen a distinct drop in its membership.  As a result the party became more radicalised, and a dissatisfied Griffin, along with fellow NF activists [[Derek Holland]] and [[Patrick Harrington]], began to embrace the ideals of Italian fascist [[Roberto Fiore]] (Fiore had arrived in the UK in 1980).  By 1983 the group had broken away to form the NF [[Political Soldier]] faction, which advocated a revival of country "values", and a return to feudalism with the establishment of nationalist communes.<ref>{{Harvnb|Goodrick-Clarke|2003|pp=68&ndash;69}}</ref>  Writing for ''Bulldog'' in 1985, Griffin praised the black separatist [[Louis Farrakhan]],<ref>{{Citation | last = Griffin | first = Nick | title = Nationalism Today, no. 29 | date = 1985-05 | page = 17 | publisher = National Front}}</ref> comments which were unpopular with some members of the party.<ref name="brute">{{Citation | title = Nick Griffin: Brute in a suit | url = http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/nick-griffin-brute-in-a-suit-553549.html | publisher = independent.co.uk | date = 2004-07-18 | accessdate = 2009-06-17}}</ref>  He also attempted to form alliances with Libya's [[Colonel Gadaffi]], and Iran's [[Ayatollah Khomeini]],<ref name="Ryanp62">{{Harvnb|Ryan|2004|p=62}}</ref> and praised the efforts of Welsh nationalist movement [[Meibion Glynd<U+0175>r]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Goodrick-Clarke|2003|p=43}}</ref>

Following a disagreement with Harrington (who subsequently formed the [[Third Way (UK)|Third Way]]), and objections over the direction the party was headed, in 1989 Griffin left the National Front.  Along with Holland and Fiore,<ref name="Ryanp62"/> he helped form the [[International Third Position]] (ITP), a development of the Political Soldier movement,<ref>{{Citation | last = Franks | first = Alan | title = A front for the Front <U+2014> Neo-Nazis | url = http://infoweb.newsbank.com/iw-search/we/InfoWeb?p_product=AWNB&p_theme=aggregated5&p_action=doc&p_docid=0F91027B59D7E14D&p_docnum=1&p_queryname=8 | format = Registration required | publisher = ''The Times'' | date = 1989-03-29 | accessdate = 2009-06-17}}</ref> but left the organisation in 1990.<ref name="Ryanp62"/>  In the same year he lost his left eye in an accident caused by a discarded shotgun cartridge exploding in a pile of burning wood at his home,<ref name="Guardianprofile"/><ref name="farrightintheuk">{{Citation| last = Bath | first = Richard | url=http://business.scotsman.com/farrightintheuk/For-all-the-talk-of.5297703.jp | title=For all the talk of change, Nick Griffin's BNP remains a single<U+2013>issue party which may be coming soon to a town near you |publisher=business.scotsman.com | date=2009-05-24 | accessdate=2009-06-21}}</ref> since when he has worn a glass eye.

===1993&ndash;1999===
Griffin re-entered politics in 1993<ref name="Ryanp63">{{Harvnb|Ryan|2004|p=63}}</ref> and in 1995, at the behest of [[John Tyndall (politician)|John Tyndall]], joined the [[British National Party]].<ref name="Guardianprofile"/><ref name="brute"/>  He also became editor of two right-wing magazines owned by Tyndall, ''Spearhead'', and <!-- 1995-1997? -->''The Rune''.<ref name="telegraphprofile">{{Citation| title = Nick Griffin | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1399674/Nick-Griffin.html |publisher=telegraph.co.uk |date=2006-01-10 |accessdate=2009-02-27}}</ref>  Referring to the election of the BNP's first councillor at a 1993 council by-election in [[Millwall]], in the [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets]], he wrote:

{{Quote|The electors of Millwall did not back a post modernist rightist party, but what they perceived to be a strong, disciplined organisation with the ability to back up its slogan "Defend Rights for Whites" with well-directed boots and fists.|Nick Griffin|<ref>{{Harvnb|Eatwell|Mudde|2004|p=69}}</ref>}}

Although Tyndall had in 1982 founded the BNP, its links to extremism helped Griffin in his 1999 campaign to replace Tyndall as BNP leader.  Griffin embarked on a campaign to make the party electable by taking it away from Tyndall's extremist agenda.  He was helped by Tyndall's lack of familiarity with the mainstream media, and in the party's September election he defeated Tyndall to become head of the BNP.  One of Griffin's changes included the party's strong emphasis on the removal of multiculturalism, a policy it claims has a destructive influence on both immigrant and British cultures.<ref name="telegraphprofile"/><ref>{{Citation | last = Eatwell | first = Roger | title = John Tyndall | url = http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/john-tyndall-499560.html | publisher = independent.co.uk | date = 2005-07-21 | accessdate = 2009-06-16}}</ref>  This realignment was designed to position the BNP alongside successful European far-right groups, such as the French ''[[National Front (France)|Front National]]''. Street protests were replaced by electoral campaigning, and some policies were moderated (the compulsory repatriation of ethnic minorities was instead made voluntary). Other policies included the introduction of capital punishment for paedophiles, rapists, drug dealers and murderers, and corporal punishment for less serious crimes such as juvenile delinquency. Voters found his background as a Cambridge-educated family man more palatable than the extreme image presented by Tyndall.<ref name="menace"/>

===2000&ndash;2009===
In addition to his earlier candidacies for the National Front, Griffin has stood as the BNP candidate in several English elections.  In 2000 he stood as the BNP candidate for the constituency of [[West Bromwich West (UK Parliament constituency)|West Bromwich West]], in a by-election triggered by the resignation of [[Betty Boothroyd]].  He came in fourth place, with 794&nbsp;votes (4.21% of those cast).<ref name="westbromwichwest">{{Citation | title = West Bromwich: Labour victory in former speaker's seat | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2000/nov/24/election2000.uk2 | publisher = guardian.co.uk | date = 2000-11-24 | accessdate = 2009-06-17}}</ref>  Following the [[2001 Oldham race riots|Oldham race riots]] he was the BNP candidate for the constituency of [[Oldham West and Royton (UK Parliament constituency)|Oldham West and Royton]] in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2001]].

He welcomed the publicity that the story generated, using it to describe the common perception of the average BNP member as a "skinhead [[wikt:oik#English|oik]]" as untrue.<ref>{{Citation | last1 = Cobain | first1 = Ian | last2 = Addley | first2 = Esther | last3 = Siddique | first3 = Haroon | title = BNP membership list posted online by former 'hardliner' | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2008/nov/19/bnp-list | publisher = guardian.co.uk | date = 2008-11-19 | accessdate = 2009-06-17}}</ref>

A second venue was chosen on the following day, at a public house near Manchester.  A line of police blocked a large group of protesters, who chanted "No platform for Nazi Nick" and "Nazi scum off our streets".  Griffin viewed the result as an important victory, claiming that his party had been demonised and blocked from holding public meetings.

==Criminal charges==
===1998===
In 1998, Griffin was convicted of violating section 19 of the [[Public Order Act 1986]], relating to the offence of 'publishing or distributing racially inflammatory written material' in issue 12 of ''The Rune'', published in 1996.  Griffin's comments in the magazine were reported to the police by [[Alex Carlile, Baron Carlile of Berriew|Alex Carlile]], then the [[Liberal Democrats|Liberal Democrat]] Member of Parliament for Montgomeryshire.  Following a police raid at Griffin's home, he was charged with distributing material likely to incite racial hatred.<ref name="lancashiretelegraph">{{Citation | title = British National Party | url = http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/news/4426099.BNP_leader_homes_in_on_new_headquarters_in_East_Lancashire/?action=complain&cid=7756002 | publisher = lancashiretelegraph.co.uk | accessdate = 2009-06-26}}</ref><ref>{{Citation | last = Pierce | first = Andrew | title = BNP leader Nick Griffin may be blocked from Queen's garden party | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/5362870/BNP-leader-Nick-Griffin-may-be-blocked-from-Queens-garden-party.html | publisher = telegraph.co.uk | date = 2009-05-21 | accessdate = 2009-06-24}}</ref>  Fellow BNP member Paul Ballard was also charged, but entered a guilty plea and did not stand trial.

===2004&ndash;2006===
On 14&nbsp;December 2004 Griffin was arrested at his home in Wales, on suspicion of incitement to racial hatred, over remarks he made about Islam in an undercover BBC documentary titled ''The Secret Agent''.<ref name="2004arrest">{{Citation | last1 = Morris | first1 = Steven | last2 = Wainwright | first2 = Martin | title = BNP leader held by police over racist remarks | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2004/dec/15/race.thefarright | publisher = guardian.co.uk | date = 2004-12-15 | accessdate = 2009-06-16}}</ref><ref>{{Citation | title = Going undercover in the BNP | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/3896213.stm | publisher = news.bbc.co.uk | date = 2004-07-15 | accessdate = 2009-06-16}}</ref>  He was questioned at a police station in [[Halifax, West Yorkshire]], before being freed on police bail.

Griffin's arrest was preceded two days earlier by that of John Tyndall, and the arrests of several other people, over remarks they had made in the same programme.<ref name="2004arrest"/>  The police had begun an investigation into the contents of the programme the day after it was broadcast on 15&nbsp;July 2004.

Griffin stood alongside fellow party activist [[Mark Collett]], who faced similar charges.  Prosecuting, Rodney Jameson QC told the jury of a total of six speeches that both accused had made in the Reservoir Tavern in Keighley on 19&nbsp;January 2004.

==Public debates==
Since his election as BNP leader, Griffin has been invited to participate in debates at several university institutions.  In November 2002 the [[Cambridge Union Society]] invited him to take part in a debate the following January.  Titled "This house believes that Islam is a threat to the west", the move was controversial; amongst more moderate speakers, one of those invited was [[Abu Hamza al-Masri]], a fundamentalist Muslim cleric.  Some of those invited then threatened to withdraw from the event, and several official bodies criticised the invitations.<ref>{{Citation | last = Curtis | first = Polly | title = Cambridge courts controversy with union invites | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2002/nov/28/highereducation.uk1 | date = 2002-11-28 | accessdate = 2009-06-24}}</ref>  The two had met earlier in the year, in a debate chaired by ''[[Today programme]]'' editor [[Rod Liddle]].<ref>{{Citation | title = Liddle defends the right to broadcast extremist views | url = http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=21726&sectioncode=1 | publisher = pressgazette.co.uk | date = 2002-10-18 | accessdate = 2009-06-24}}</ref><!-- Although the debate went ahead, neither Griffin or al-Masri attended.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} -->  He was also invited by the Cambridge Forum to a debate on extremism in December 2002, with [[Liberal Democrats|Liberal Democrat]] MP [[Lembit Opik]].  The location of the venue was changed twice after protests from property owners, but the threat of a violent confrontation between the Anti-Nazi League and BNP supporters forced the president of the Cambridge Forum, Chris Paley, to cancel the event.  Paley called the decision an "own goal" for the values of free speech, and Opik criticised the policy, emphasising his belief in "people's right to make their own decisions in a democracy".<ref>{{Citation | title = Last minute cancellation | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2002/dec/04/highereducation.uk4 | publisher = guardian.co.uk | date = 2002-12-04 | accessdate = 2009-06-24}}</ref>

In February 2005 Griffin was asked to take part in a debate on multiculturalism at the [[University of St Andrews]] in [[Scotland]].  He was invited by the president of the students' debating society, who said "We believe that the only way to get the truth of what the BNP are saying and to combat them is to do it in public in a debate."<ref name="standrews">{{Citation | editor = Staff and agencies | title = Student debate with BNP leader 'a disgrace' | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2005/feb/03/race.students | publisher = guardian.co.uk | date = 2005-02-03 | accessdate = 2009-06-26}}</ref>  The move was attacked by various anti-racist groups, some of whom refused to participate in the discussion.  Griffin said "I am coming up because I was invited by the students at the university because they have a debate on an intelligent subject on which I have something to say.  The people against it are the usual bunch of people who cannot win the argument and refuse to stand on a platform."<ref name="standrews"/>  The university later withdrew the invitation.<ref name="standrews"/><ref>{{Citation | last = Curtis | first = Polly | title = College tells students to reverse Israeli ban | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2005/feb/05/highereducation.internationaleducationnews | publisher = guardian.co.uk | date = 2005-02-05 | accessdate = 2009-06-26}}</ref>

In May 2007 Griffin was invited to address a meeting at the [[University of Bath]] by politics student and BNP youth leader Danny Lake.  Lake wanted Griffin to visit the university and explain the BNP's policies to lecturers and students.  It was, however, viewed by some as an attempt by the party to establish a foothold on the university campus.  Eleven union general secretaries wrote to the university's vice-chancellor and asked her to reconsider the decision to allow the meeting.  A large protest was planned, and following students' concerns over their personal safety the invitation was withdrawn.<ref>{{Citation| last = Taylor | first = Matthew | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2007/may/11/students.thefarright/ |title=University bars BNP leader from campus after protest fears |publisher=guardian.co.uk |date= 2007-05-11 |accessdate=2009-02-27}}</ref>

[[File:David Irving.jpg|right|upright|thumb|[[David Irving]]]]
Several months later the [[Oxford Union]] invited Griffin to speak at a forum on the limits of free speech, along with other speakers including [[David Irving]].  The invitation was condemned by the president of the Oxford Students' Union, and race equalities watchdog [[Trevor Phillips]], and MP Dr [[Julian Lewis]] resigned his membership of the Union.<ref>{{Citation | title = Union debate row speakers arrive | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/oxfordshire/7112480.stm | publisher = news.bbc.co.uk | date = 2006-11-26 | accessdate = 2009-06-16}}</ref>

A rally against the invitation was held at Oxford Town Hall on 20 November, and included the Oxford Students' Union president, the [[National Union of Students of the United Kingdom|National Union of Students]] black students' officer, and the [[Trades Union Congress]] south east regional secretary.  Representatives of [[Unite Against Fascism]] also attended, as well as the University of Oxford's Jewish student chaplain.  Several Holocaust survivors also spoke at the rally.  Stephen Altmann-Richer, co-president of the Oxford University Jewish Society, said "I don't think these people should be invited to the Oxford Union, by having them speak, it legitimises their views ..."<ref>{{Citation | title = Rally over Oxford Union speakers | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/oxfordshire/7103350.stm | publisher = news.bbc.co.uk | date = 2007-11-21 | accessdate = 2009-06-16}}</ref>  On the night of the debate, about 50 protesters forced their way into the venue, and a crowd of hundreds gathered outside carrying banners bearing anti-racist slogans and voicing anti-BNP chants.  Police blocked the entrances to the building, and removed the protesters encamped inside.  Griffin was accompanied into the premises by security guards.  The event was eventually split between two rooms, with Griffin speaking in one, and Irving in the other; many Union Society members were unable to gain access, reducing the audience.  Although many present found the debate objectionable, some were supportive of both Griffin and Irving's right to freedom of speech.  The Oxford Union later endorsed the debate as a success.<ref>{{Citation | title = Angry scenes greet Oxford debate | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/oxfordshire/7114343.stm | publisher = news.bbc.co.uk | date = 2007-11-27 | accessdate = 2009-06-16}}</ref>

Griffin travelled to the United States and spoke at [[Clemson University]] and [[Texas A&M University]], but the reception he received in October 2007 at [[Michigan State University]] was markedly different to that in the other venues.  Intending to address the "overpopulation of Islamists in Europe", he was repeatedly interrupted, to the point where the event became a question and answer session.  He was repeatedly heckled by hostile elements of the audience, and at one point the fire alarm was activated.<ref>{{Citation | last = Guentzel | first = Lindsay | title = British politician's talk creates uproar | url = http://www.mndaily.com/2007/10/29/british-politicians-talk-creates-uproar | publisher = mndaily.com | date = 2007-10-29 | accessdate = 2009-06-25}}</ref>

Griffin describes himself as a "moderniser", and "new nationalist", and upon his election as leader of the BNP spoke of his contempt for its traditional supporters.<ref>{{Citation | last = Wheen | first = Francis | title = The right revs up | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/1999/oct/13/race.world | publisher = guardian.co.uk | date = 1999-10-13 | accessdate = 2009-09-29}}</ref>  He has changed the BNP's traditional focus on immigration and race, to a defence of what it sees as "our traditional principles against the politically correct agenda"<ref name="BBCprofile">{{Citation | title = Profile: Nick Griffin | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4670574.stm | publisher = news.bbc.co.uk | date = 2006-11-10 | accessdate = 2009-09-29}}</ref> espoused by mainstream politicians.

The BNP also produced a journal devoted to rural matters.<ref name="Eatwellmuddlepp6970"/>

The BNP's constitution grants its chairman full executive power over all party affairs, and Griffin thus carries sole responsibility for the party's legal and financial liabilities, and has the final say in all decisions affecting the party.<ref>{{Citation | title = Constitution of the British National Party, section 3, Party leadership | edition = 8 | page = 5 | date = 2004-11 | url =http://web.archive.org/web/20070629010001/http://www.bnp.org.uk/resources/constitution_8ed.pdf | format = PDF | publisher = bnp.org.uk | accessdate = 2009-06-16}}</ref>  Its policies include a halt to all immigration, the forced repatriation of all illegal immigrants, and the deportation of criminals whose original nationality was not British.

Upon his election to the European Parliament he attempted to form a formal alliance with right-wing parties, which would have entitled them to extra funding, but was unsuccessful.

His inclusion on the programme was criticised by contributor and radio presenter [[Jon Gaunt]], who branded the decision as "pathetic".<ref>{{Citation  | title = BBC in race row after BNP leader blames Muslims for Britain's drug problems  | url = http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-23450274-details/BBC+in+race+row+after+leader+blames+Muslims+for+Britain%27s+drug+problems/article.do | publisher = thisislondon.co.uk | date = 2008-03-07 | accessdate = 2009-06-17}}</ref>  When asked by ''[[The Times]]'' about concerns that his recent success was presaged in [[Enoch Powell]]'s [[Rivers of Blood speech]], Griffin replied:

{{Quote|The divisions are already there.  They were created by that monstrous experiment: the multi-cultural destruction of old Britain.  There is no clash between the indigenous population and, for instance, settled West Indians, Sikhs and Hindus.  There is, however, an enormous correlation between high BNP votes and nearby Islamic populations.  The reason for that is nothing to do with Islamophobia; it is issues such as the grooming of young English girls for sex by a criminal minority of the Muslim population&nbsp;... I am now there to give political articulation to the concerns of the mainly indigenous population.  The ethnic populations have always had Labour to speak up for them.  Finally their neighbours have got someone who speaks up for them.|Nick Griffin|<ref name="breach"/>}}

In a June 2009 interview with [[Channel 4 News]] Griffin claimed that "There's no such thing as a black Welshman",<ref name="EHRCinterview">{{Citation | title = Nick Griffin interview - Channel 4 News | publisher = [[Channel 4 News]] | date = 2009-06-23}}</ref> which was criticised by [[Vaughan Gething]] (the first black president of the [[NUS Wales|Welsh NUS]], the first black president of the [[Wales TUC|Welsh TUC]], and the first black candidate for the [[Welsh assembly]]).  Commenting on Griffin's claim, he said "On that basis, most white people wouldn't qualify.

Although the interviewer (BBC Correspondent Shirin Wheeler) implied that Griffin may have wished the EU to "murder people at sea", he quickly corrected her by saying "I didn't say anyone should be murdered at sea&mdash;I say boats should be sunk, they can throw them a life raft and they can go back to Libya" (a staging post for migrants from Egypt and sub-Saharan Africa).<ref>{{Citation |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8141069.stm|title=Sink immigrants' boats - Griffin |date=2009-07-08|publisher=news.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=2009-07-10}}</ref>

In a BBC interview on 8&nbsp;June 2009 Griffin claimed that "global warming is essentially a hoax" and that it "is being exploited by the liberal elite as a means of taxing and controlling us and the real crisis is peak oil".<ref>{{Citation | last = Hickman | first = Leo | title = 'Global warming is hoax': the world according to Nick Griffin | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/blog/2009/jun/09/climate-change-oil | publisher = guardian.co.uk | date = 2009-06-09 | accessdate = 2009-06-17}}</ref>
