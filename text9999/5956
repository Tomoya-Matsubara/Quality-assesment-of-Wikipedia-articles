"'''Cartoon KAT-TUN II You'''" is the second studio album by [[Japan]]ese [[boy band]] [[KAT-TUN]], released in [[Japan]] on [[April 18]] [[2007]] by [[J Storm|J-One Records]]. It is the group's first album to not feature all six members with [[Jin Akanishi]] taking a sabbatical to study overseas six months prior. The album was released in three editions; a regular version with all 14 tracks, a first press edition with the same track listing as its regular counterpart with a 40-page photo booklet and a limited edition which came with an extra [[Extended play|EP]] of seven bonus tracks. The limited edition did not feature the song, "You". 

With the release of this album, KAT-TUN became the first artist in Japanese music history to have all of their collective releases (three singles, two albums, and five DVDs at the time) reach number 1 on the charts.<ref>[http://www.tokyograph.com/news/id-947 KAT-TUN reaches 10 in a row], Tokyograph, Oricon; retrieved on August 3, 2008.</ref> The album was certified double platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of Japan]].<ref>[http://www.riaj.or.jp/data/others/gold/200704.html Recording Industry Association of Japan: April 2007]; retrieved on August 4, 2008.</ref> KAT-TUN went on a [[KAT-TUN#Concerts|seven-city nationwide tour]] from [[April 3]] [[2007]] to [[June 17]] [[2007]] in support of the album. The last performance at [[Tokyo Dome]] was filmed and released on DVD entitled "Tour 2007 Cartoon KAT-TUN II You" on [[November 21]] [[2007]].<ref>[http://www.johnnys-net.jp/j/artists/kattun/disco/disco_dvd.html KAT-TUN discography: DVD], Johnny's Net; retrieved on August 7, 2008.</ref>

==Album information==
The album's title is similarly named to the group's late-night talk show, ''[[Cartoon KAT-TUN]]'', which began airing two weeks before the album's release on [[Nippon Television|NTV]]. The album was recorded in [[Tokyo]] and Bennett Studios in [[Englewood, New Jersey]]. Songwriters who presided over the group's debut album also contributed several tracks to the record. ma-saya who worked with KAT-TUN before penned their second single, "[[SIGNAL (KAT-TUN single)|SIGNAL]]", and the third track, "Splash...". [[Kazumasa Oda]], folk singer-songwriter formerly of [[Off Course]], wrote their third single, "[[Bokura no Machi de]]", a tender love ballad. Yoji Kubota, a prolific lyricist for many of Japan's contemporary pop artists, wrote "Movin on..." with [[arrangement|arranger]] Nao Tanaka and also penned "Heartbreak Club". The group's [[senpai]], [[Takizawa Hideaki]] of [[Tackey & Tsubasa]], composed the music for "My Angel, You are Angel".<ref name="CKT3">[http://wiki.theppn.org/Cartoon_KAT-TUN_II_You Cartoon KAT-TUN II You], Wiki.theppn; retrieved on August 3, 2008.</ref> All tracks from the bonus CD are songs KAT-TUN had been performing in concerts and ''Sh<U+014D>nen Club'' since their junior days. The second track, "Peak", was used in a commercial for [[NTT]] [[DoCoMo]]'s 903iTV series of cellphones which [[Kazuya Kamenashi]] starred in.

KAT-TUN members also received a solo track each which they co-wrote themselves, with the exception of [[Kazuya Kamenashi]] and [[Junnosuke Taguchi]]. The fourteenth track, "You", was not officially released as a single but a [[music video]] was shot marking [[Jin Akanishi]]'s return to the group. The song also served as a [[theme song]] to Kamenashi's drama, ''[[Suppli]]''.<ref name="CKT4">[http://www.jbook.co.jp/p/p.aspx/3327971/s Album Details - Cartoon KAT-TUN II You (Limited Edition)], JBOOKS. Retrieved on August 3, 2008.</ref> All rap lyrics featured in the album were also written by [[Koki Tanaka]] himself; he also co-wrote his rap verses in "Fight All Night" with [[Tomohisa Yamashita]] of [[News (band)|NEWS]] and with bandmate [[Yuichi Nakamaru]] for "No Matter Matter".<ref name="CKT3"/>

==Chart performance and reception==
In its first week of release, ''Cartoon KAT-TUN II You'' sold 270,976 copies in Japan, a sharp drop from the first-week sales of their debut album. Despite the stark difference in reported sales, the album's two singles which had been released months in advance had seen more than 1 million shipments altogether before the album's release in April 2007. The album's first week numbers were enough to grab the number 1 spot on the Oricon album charts, however, and it stayed on the charts for another 3 weeks before dropping off the top 30. The album has sold more than 354,973 copies to date and was certified as the 30th best-selling album of 2007 by [[Oricon]] at the end of the year.

KAT-TUN also won six awards at the 21st [[Japan Gold Disc Awards]] with "SIGNAL" and "Bokura no Machi de" placing on the "The Best 10 Singles (Domestic)" list.<ref>[http://www.riaj.or.jp/e/data/gdisc/2007.html Recording Industry of Japan: Japan Gold Disc Awards]; retrieved on August 2, 2008.</ref>

===Singles===
"[[Signal (KAT-TUN song)|Signal]]" was the first single released from the album. Released nine months in advance, the song debuted at number 1 with 450,752 copies sold in its first week of release. It stayed on the charts for 7 weeks and sold more than 566,233 copies by the end of its chart-run. The song was certified double platinum by the RIAJ and the fifth best-selling song of 2006 by [[Oricon]].

"[[Bokura no Machi de]]" was the second single and was released in [[December 2006]]. It became KAT-TUN's third number 1 single with first-week sales of 410,103 copies and sold a total of 558,491 copies at the end of its chart run.
