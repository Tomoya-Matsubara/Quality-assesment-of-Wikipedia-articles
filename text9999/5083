{{History of Armenia}}
The '''Kingdom of Armenia''' (or '''Greater Armenia''') was an independent kingdom from (approximately 355 years) [[190 BC]] to AD [[165]], and a client state of the [[Roman Empire]] from 165 to [[428]].

The predecessor of the Kingdom was the Satrapy of Armenia part of the [[Achaemenid Empire]], which later became an independent Kingdom under the [[Orontid Dynasty]] with [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonian]] influence.

After the destruction of the [[Seleucid Empire]], a [[Hellenistic Greece|Hellenistic Greek]] successor state of [[Alexander the Great]]'s short-lived empire, a Hellenistic Armenian state was founded in 190 BC by [[Artaxias I]]. At its zenith, from [[95 BC|95]] to [[66 BC]], Armenia extended its rule over parts of the Caucasus and the area that is now eastern [[Turkey]], [[Syria]] and [[Lebanon]]. For a time, Armenia was one of the most powerful states in the Roman East. It came under the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[sphere of influence]] in 66 BC.

Subsequently, Armenia was often a focus of contention between Rome and [[Persian Empire|Persia]]. The [[Parthia|Parthians]] forced Armenia into submission from [[37]] to [[47]], when the Romans retook control of the kingdom.

Under [[Nero]], the Romans fought a campaign ([[55]]&ndash;[[63]]) against the [[Parthian Empire]], which had invaded the kingdom of Armenia, allied to the Romans. After gaining ([[60]]) and losing ([[62]]) Armenia, the Romans sent [[Legio XV Apollinaris|XV ''Apollinaris'']] from [[Pannonia]] to [[Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo|Cn. Domitius Corbulo]], ''legatus'' of [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]]. Corbulo, with the legions XV ''Apollinaris'', [[Legio III Gallica|III ''Gallica'']], [[Legio V Macedonica|V ''Macedonica'']], [[Legio X Fretensis|X ''Fretensis'']] and [[Legio XXII Diotariana|XXII]], entered ([[63]]) into the territories of [[Vologases I of Parthia]], who returned the Armenian kingdom to [[Tiridates I of Armenia|Tiridates]].

Another campaign was led by Emperor [[Lucius Verus]] in [[162]]-[[165]], after [[Vologases IV of Parthia]] had invaded Armenia and installed his chief general on its throne. To counter the Parthian threat, Verus set out for the east. His army won significant victories and retook the capital. Sohaemus, a Roman citizen of Armenian heritage, was installed as the new [[client king]]. 

The [[Sassanid]] Persians occupied Armenia in [[252]] and held it until the Romans returned in [[287]]. In [[384]] the kingdom was split between the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] or [[East Roman]] Empire and the Persians. Western Armenia quickly became a province of the [[Roman Empire]] under the name of [[Armenia Minor]]; Eastern Armenia remained a kingdom within Persia until [[428]], when the local nobility overthrew the king, and the Sassanids installed a governor in his place.
