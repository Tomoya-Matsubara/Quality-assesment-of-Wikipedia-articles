'''Gregory James "Greg" LeMond''' (born June 26, 1961) is a former professional [[road bicycle racer]], entrepreneur, and anti-doping advocate from the [[United States]]. He was [[UCI Road World Championships <U+2013> Men's road race|World Champion]] in [[1983 UCI Road World Championships|1983]] and [[1989 UCI Road World Championships|1989]], and is a three-time winner of the [[Tour de France]].

==Racing career==

===1976<U+2013>1983: Early career===
LeMond's introduction to [[cycling]] came thanks to [[freestyle skiing]] pioneer [[Wayne Wong (skier)|Wayne Wong]] in 1975.<ref>{{cite book|last=LeMond|first=Greg|title=Greg LeMond's complete book of bicycling|year=1987|publisher=Putnam Publishing Group|location=New York|isbn=0399132295|pages=352|edition=1st|coauthors=Kent Gordis|page=16|quote=Wayne Wong taught me a lot about skiing. One thing he especially recommended as an ideal off-season exercise was cycling.

Borysewicz, whom LeMond described as his "first real coach,"<ref>LeMond p. 24</ref> wanted to retain his [[prot<U+00E9>g<U+00E9>]] through the next Olympic-cycle and discouraged him from turning pro, but LeMond was determined. Nevertheless, while he was the reigning Junior World Road Champion in 1980, LeMond received no offers, and so in the spring 1980, he joined the U.S. National cycling team for a 6-week European racing campaign. There, he finished third overall in the [[Circuit_des_Ardennes_(cycling)|Circuit des Ardennes]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Circuit des Ardennes 1980|url=http://www.cyclingarchives.com/ritfiche.php?ritid=112429|publisher=Cyclingarchvies.com|accessdate=December 24, 2012}}</ref> before winning the [[Circuit de la Sarthe (cycling)|1980 Circuit de la Sarthe]] stage race in France,<ref>{{cite web|title=Circuit Cycliste Sarthe - Pays de la Loire 1980|url=http://www.cyclingfever.com/editie.html?editie_id=8129|publisher=CyclingFever.com|accessdate=December 24, 2012}}</ref> thereby becoming the first American and youngest rider of any nationality "in the history of the sport to win a major pro-am cycling event [in Europe]."<ref>LeMond p. 25</ref> That victory, and the subsequent press coverage, raised LeMond's profile in Europe and he was scouted at his next event (the Ruban Granitier Breton stage race) by French cycling coach and [[Renault-Elf-Gitane]] [[directeur sportif]] [[Cyrille Guimard]]. Guimard said he was impressed with LeMond's spirit, and told him, "You have the fire to be a great champion," before offering him a professional contract for 1981 with Renault.<ref>LeMond p. 26</ref> After he returned to the United States, LeMond won the 1980 [[Nevada City Classic]], considered to be one of the most historic and challenging professional cycling races in [[United_States_of_America|America]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://cbs13.com/local/lance.armstrong.nevada.2.1054073.html|title=Lance Armstrong Wins Nevada City Classic|date=June 21, 2009|work=CBS 13|accessdate=16 November 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Nevada City Classic 1980|url=http://www.cyclingarchives.com/ritfiche.php?ritid=89479|publisher=Cyclingarchives.com|accessdate=December 24, 2012}}</ref> Despite eventually receiving several other offers to turn professional besides Guimard's, LeMond did not consider them seriously, and he signed with Renault in Paris on the day the [[1980 Tour de France|Tour de France]] finished.<ref>LeMond p. 27</ref>

LeMond's first professional victory came three months after his 1981 debut, when he won a stage of the French [[Tour de l'Oise]]. He also won the [[Coors Classic]] in the United States, finishing ahead of the 1980 Olympic road champion [[:fr:Sergue<U+00EF> Soukhoroutchenkov|Sergue<U+00EF> Soukhoroutchenkov]], but LeMond considered his third-place overall in the 1981 [[Dauphin<U+00E9> Lib<U+00E9>r<U+00E9>]] to have been the "major steppingstone," in his career thus far, saying, "It showed me that I had the kind of climbing ability that you need to win the top European stage races."<ref> LeMond p.28</ref>

LeMond won the silver medal at the 1982 [[World Cycling Championship]], and in 1983, he won the World Championship outright, becoming the first American rider to do so.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://greglemond.com/cycling-legend/|title=Cycling Legend: Europe <U+2013> Pro World Championship|publisher=GregLeMond.com}}</ref> His enormous talent <U+2013> his overall strength, climbing ability, his capability to ride a fast time trial and his recovery capacity <U+2013> suggested LeMond would be an excellent prospect for the more demanding [[Grand Tours]].<ref>McGann p. 146</ref>

===1984<U+2013>1986: Grand Tours===
LeMond rode his first [[Tour de France]] in [[1984 Tour de France|1984]] for Renault-Elf-Gitane, under the guidance of Cyrille Guimard. He finished third overall while riding in support of team leader [[Laurent Fignon]], and won the [[young rider classification in the Tour de France|young rider classification]]. After this auspicious debut, French businessman [[Bernard Tapie]] and his superstar [[Bernard Hinault]] approached LeMond with a one-million dollar contract offer - the first in cycling's history - to leave [[Renault-Elf-Gitane]] at the end of 1984 and join Hinault at [[La Vie Claire]] for three years. LeMond accepted the offer and joined on a 3-year contract to first ride in support of team captain [[Bernard Hinault]], who had regained his form and was attempting to win his fifth Tour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/lemond-remembers-fignon|last=Farrand|first=Stephen|work=Cycling News|title=LeMond Remembers Fignon|date=August 31, 2010}}</ref>  Hinault led the [[1985 Tour de France]] through the early mountain stages, but suffered a crash and began to struggle. And as Hinault faltered, LeMond realized he was capable of winning the Tour in his own right, but Tapie and [[La Vie Claire]] DS [[:de:Paul K<U+00F6>chli|Paul K<U+00F6>chli]] ordered the 24-year-old LeMond to wait and ride in support of Hinault.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://greglemond.com/cycling-legend/|title=Cycling Legend: Controversy <U+2013> Feud 1985|publisher=GregLeMond.com}}</ref> So instead of pressing his advantage, LeMond let the leaders pull away and dropped back to aid Hinault, who went on to win the [[1985 Tour de France|1985 Tour]], with LeMond in second, 1:42 behind. LeMond was clearly frustrated by the events, and later revealed that team management and K<U+00F6>chli had misled him as to how far back Hinault was during the crucial mountain stage.<ref name="Malessa">{{cite web|url=http://www.roble.net/marquis/coaching/lemond98.html|last=Malessa|first=Bryan|title=Once Was King: An interview with Greg LeMond|publisher=Roble Systems, Inc.|year=1998|accessdate=December 15, 2012|}}</ref>{{#tag:ref|Quote: "Yes, but they lied to me. I had about a three to four minute lead on him at that point, but I thought I only had about 45 seconds. Every time I asked them exactly how much time I had they'd evade the answer, telling me Hinault was in the group right behind me. Then when the pack of riders came up with Sean Kelly and Phil Anderson, guys who I climbed much better than, Hinault was still nowhere in sight....It was Bernard Tapie's and Paul Keochli's conspiracy to make sure Hinault won his fifth Tour."|group=N}} Regardless, LeMond rode as the dutiful lieutenant, and his support enabled Hinault to win his fifth Tour.

[[File:Greg Lemond Coors Classic.jpg|thumbnail|left|LeMond (left) in the 1986 Coors Classic]]
The following year in the [[1986 Tour de France|1986 Tour]], LeMond was made co-leader of the [[La Vie Claire]] team alongside Hinault, with Hinault publicly promising to ride in support of LeMond to repay LeMond for the work he had done in 1985.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1065079/index.htm|title=An American Takes Paris: Pushed to the limit by Bernard Hinault, Greg LeMond (in yellow) rode to a historic win in the Tour de France|publisher=SportsIllustrated.CNN.com | date=August 4, 1986}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cyclingrevealed.com/oct05/top25-19.html|title=Top 25 All Time Tours #19: 1986 <U+2013> LeMond Wins After Hinault's Betrayal|publisher=CyclingRevealed.com}}</ref> What he did not say was that the help was contingent upon LeMond demonstrating that he was clearly the better rider. Hinault was in superb form, and had the chance to win an unprecedented sixth Tour. In Stage 12, the first mountain stage of the race in the Pyrenees, Hinault attacked the lead group and built up an overall lead. By the end of Stage 12, Hinault had a five-minute lead over LeMond and the other top riders. He claimed he was trying to draw out LeMond's rivals, but none of these attacks were planned with LeMond. He was clearly willing to ride aggressively and take advantage of the opportunities presented. LeMond was never in trouble, except by his own teammate. The following day Hinault broke away again early but was caught and then dropped by LeMond on the final climb of Stage 13, allowing LeMond to gain back four and a half minutes. The next three stages brought the Tour to the Alps. On Stage 17 LeMond and [[Urs Zimmermann]] dropped Hinault from the leading group, and the end of the day saw LeMond pulling on the [[General classification in the Tour de France|yellow jersey]] of race leader, the first time it had ever been worn by a rider from the United States.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1986-07-21/sports/sp-26494_1_yellow-jersey|title=Tour de France: LeMond Takes Lead, Yellow Jersey|publisher=LATimes.com | date=July 21, 1986}}</ref>  The following day in the Alps saw Hinault attack again early on the first climb, but he was pulled back. Attempting an escape on the descent, he was unable to separate himself from LeMond. The two La Vie Claire team leaders continued to pull away as they ascended the next col, and maintained the gap as they reached the base of the final climb, the vaunted [[Alpe d'Huez]]. They put on a showcase of strength and form through the twenty-one switchbacks, cresting the summit together. LeMond put an arm around Hinault and gave him a smile and the stage win in a show of unity,<ref name="An American">{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1065079/2/index.htm|title=An American Takes Paris: Pushed to the limit by Bernard Hinault, Greg LeMond (in yellow) rode to a historic win in the Tour de France|publisher=SportsIllustrated.CNN.com | date=August 4, 1986}}</ref> but the infighting was not over. Hinault attacked again on Stage 19 and had to be brought back by teammates [[Andy Hampsten]] and [[Steve Bauer]]. Commenting on the team situation prior to the final individual time trial at Stage 20, LeMond offered the following with a wry smile:

"He's attacked me from the beginning of the Tour De France. He's never helped me once, and I don't feel confident at all with him."<ref>{{cite video|people=Phil Liggett and Paul Sherwen|date=2003|title=1986 Tour De France|format=DVD |work=World Cycling Productions|producer=Rodney Taylor}}</ref>

LeMond had to keep his eye on his teammate and rival throughout the race. Hinault rode aggressively and repeatedly attacked, and the division created in the La Vie Claire team was unmistakable.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/cycling/8590177/Bernard-Hinault-and-Greg-LeMonds-classic-1986-Tour-de-France-duel-relived-in-Slaying-the-Badger.html|title=Bernard Hinault and Greg LeMond's classic 1986 Tour de France duel relived in Slaying the Badger|publisher=Telegraph.co.uk | location=London|first=Brendan|last=Gallagher|date=June 22, 2011}}</ref> LeMond would keep the yellow jersey to the end of the race and win his first Tour, but he felt betrayed by Hinault and the La Vie Claire team leadership, declaring that "[Hinault] hasn't helped me one iota.... I have no respect for him anymore.... I know I'll never be friends with him again after this race. Not the way he's treated me."<ref name="An American"/> LeMond later stated the 1986 Tour was the most difficult and stressful race of his career.

LeMond had planned to defend his title in the [[1987 Tour de France]] with La Vie Claire, but was unable to participate. Early that year he was riding in the [[Tirreno-Adriatico]], an early spring tune-up race, when he fell, suffering a fracture to his left wrist.  He returned to the United States to recover from the injury.

===1989: Return to elite level===
[[Image:Greg LeMond 1989 Tour de France stage 21 TT.jpg|thumb|LeMond starts the final time trial of the [[1989 Tour de France]]]]
After struggling in the 1989 [[Paris-Nice]] race and failing to find his form, LeMond informed his wife Kathy that he intended to retire from professional cycling after the [[1989 Tour de France]].<ref name="Le Grand LeMond"/>  LeMond rode the [[1989 Giro d'Italia]] as preparation for the Tour to follow, but was consistently dropped on the climbs and was not in contention for any of the race jerseys.  However the race closed with a 53 km individual time trial into Florence.  After being treated for anemia with an iron injection earlier in the race<ref name="Le Grand LeMond"/> and with the racing miles from the Giro's earlier stages now in his legs, LeMond placed second on this 22nd and final stage of the 1989 Giro d'Italia, beating overall Giro winner Laurent Fignon by over a minute on the stage.<ref>http://www.bikeraceinfo.com/giro/giro1989.html</ref>

Coming into the Tour LeMond was not considered a contender for the General Classification (GC).<ref name="Vive LeMond!">{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1068628/1/index.htm|title=Vive Lemond!|publisher=Sports Illustrated |author=Franz Lidz|date= July 31, 1989 |accessdate= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cyclinghalloffame.com/riders/rider_bio.asp?rider_id=23|title=Cycling Hall of Fame: Greg Lemond}}</ref>{{#tag:ref|General Classification tracks overall times for bicycle riders in multi-stage bicycle races.

Buoyed by the result, LeMond rode himself into first place in the 73&nbsp;km stage 5 [[individual time trial]], which gave him the [[yellow jersey]] of race leader for the first time in three years. The Tour reached the first mountains <U+2013> the [[Pyr<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>es]]. And although he lost the lead to his former teammate and rival [[Laurent Fignon]] on stage 10 in [[Superbagn<U+00E8>res]], LeMond reclaimed yellow five days later in the [[Alps]], after the 39&nbsp;km stage 15 mountain time trial from [[Gap, Hautes-Alpes|Gap]] to [http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orci%C3%A8res_1850 Orci<U+00E8>res-Merlette]. But it was Fignon who seemed to have won the see-saw battle and sealed a third overall victory, when he cracked LeMond on stage 17 with 4&nbsp;km to go up the climb of [[Alpe d'Huez]]. Fignon held a 50-second advantage over LeMond going into the 21st and final stage, a rare 24.5&nbsp;km [[individual time trial]] from [[Versailles]] to [[Paris]] ([[Champs-<U+00C9>lys<U+00E9>es]]).  

Fignon had won the Tour twice before, in [[1983 Tour de France|1983]] and [[1984 Tour de France|1984]], and was a very capable [[time trialist]]. It seemed almost impossible for LeMond to make up 50 seconds over the 24.5 kilometer course, which would require LeMond to gain two seconds per kilometer against one of the fastest chrono-specialists in the world.<ref name="Le Grand LeMond"/><ref name="Vive LeMond!"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bicycling.com/news/2010-tour-de-france/moment-1-1989-lemonds-8-second|title=30 Greatest Moments of the Tour de France|publisher=Bicycling.com}}</ref> But LeMond rode the time trial with a cut-down [[Giro (company)|Giro]] [[Bicycle helmet|aero helmet]] and innovative [[Scott USA|Scott]] clip-on [[aero bars]], which created less [[aerodynamic drag]] than traditional time trial equipment, while Fignon chose to go helmetless, using standard [[Bicycle_handlebar#Pursuit|"cowhorn" handlebars]].

===1990: A third tour win===

After his storybook 1989-season, LeMond parlayed his success into the richest contract in the sport's history, signing a $5.5 million deal for three years with [[Cr<U+00E9>dit Agricole (cycling team)|Z-Tomasso]] of France.<ref>{{cite web|title=LeMond Is Honored as Sportsman of Year|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-12-24/sports/sp-2094_1_greg-lemond|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=December 12, 2012|date=December 24, 1989|quote=He parlayed his success into the richest contract in his sport's history, a three-year, $5.5 million deal with France's "Z" cycling team.}}</ref> He entered the [[1990 Tour de France]] as defending champion and a pre-race favorite after leaving ADR to join the much stronger [[Cr<U+00E9>dit Agricole (cycling team)|Z-Tomasso]] team. At "Z" his team mates included [[Robert Millar]], [[Eric Boyer]] and [[Ronan Pensec]], all of whom already had  finishes in the top six of the Tour de France. This unified roster of strong riders appeared capable of supporting LeMond in the mountains and controlling the race on the flats.<ref>{{cite web|title=1990 Tour Quick Facts|url=http://www.bikeraceinfo.com/tdf/tdf1990.html|work=1990 Tour de France  June 30 to July 22  Results, stages with running GC, map, photos and history|publisher=Bike Race Info|accessdate=December 11, 2012|quote=Greg LeMond won his third Tour in 1990.

The squad's tactical plan was upset on the first day, when a breakaway that included LeMond's teammate Ronan Pensec, but no major favorites, arrived ten minutes ahead of the field. LeMond was prevented from challenging for the lead until the final [[individual time trial]] on stage 20, when he finished over two minutes ahead of [[Claudio Chiappucci]], overhauling the unheralded Italian in the General Classification and taking the yellow jersey, which he held to Paris. LeMond had the distinction of winning the 1990 Tour without taking victory in a single individual stage. The perceived strength of the Z team was vindicated when they led the team classification for most of the race winning this to add to LeMond's yellow jersey.

In September, LeMond attempted to defend his title at the [[1990 UCI Road World Championships]], but instead finished fourth, eight seconds behind the winner, his former teammate [[Rudy Dhaenens]] of Belgium.<ref>{{cite news|last=Raia|first=James|title=CYCLING; LeMond finishes fourth in World|accessdate=December 18, 2012|newspaper=USA Today|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/USAToday/access/56017728.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS&date=Sep+4%2C+1990&author=James+Raia&pub=USA+TODAY+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&edition=&startpage=02.C&desc=CYCLING%3BLeMond+finishes+fourth+in+World|date=September 4, 1990|location=McLean, VA|page=02.C|quote=Rudy Dhaenens of Belgium edged cramping countryman and PDM teammate Dirk De Wolf to the win in 6 hours, 51 minutes and 59 seconds.

LeMond felt confident before the [[1991 Tour de France]]. He was the defending champion, trained well and had a solid team to support him. LeMond was among the leaders going into the Stage 8 [[individual time trial]], and he finished second to the Spaniard [[Miguel Indurain]].

I mean if you're in the thick of racing, you understand the hierarchy. During those two years, Hinault was out, Fignon was out. Put it this way, in '89 and '90 I only feel like I raced to 90 to 95 percent of my potential. In '86 I was much stronger, climbed much faster, much better time-trialist. When we would do the time-trials, Hinault and I would finish two to three minutes up on most people. And you have to remember that in cycling, every year you make minute improvements. In '86 I wasn't out of the top five stage races from February to September. Of course you can't rewrite racing history, but I'm confident that I would have won five Tours."|group=N}}

In April 2008, Trek announced that it was dropping LeMond Bicycles from its product line and would sue to sever the licensing agreement. It quickly emerged that in March 2008, LeMond had filed a complaint against Trek for breach of contract, claiming that they had not made a "best efforts" attempt to sell his bicycles, as well as describing attempts to 'silence' him about doping, including incidents in 2001 and 2004.<ref>{{cite web|last=Vinton|first=Nathaniel|title=Greg LeMond's lawsuit against Trek is about more than broken promises <U+2013> it's about Lance, too|url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2009-11-07/sports/17940067_1_greg-lemond-trek-cycling|publisher=New York Daily News|accessdate=December 10, 2012|date=September 7, 2009|quote=What on its surface is a contract dispute about sales figures and "best efforts" is also a showdown between LeMond and Armstrong.

But LeMond's complaint lays out some stark numbers meant to demonstrate the company soft-pedaled its sales agreement. For example, between September of 2001 and June of 2007, Trek only sold $10,393 worth of LeMond bikes in France. "On the best efforts, I think LeMond is totally in the right here," said a person familiar with the case. "That's at most a dozen bikes in France in over five years. The guy speaks French.

In December 2012, LeMond claimed that a change needed to be made at the head of leadership for the UCI, and stated if called upon he would be willing to take the position himself if necessary to lead cycling out of the mire of doping.  Said LeMond: <blockquote>"It is now or never to act. After the earthquake caused by the [[Lance_Armstrong#USADA_Investigation_2011-2012|Armstrong case]], another chance will not arise. I am willing to invest to make this institution more democratic, transparent and look for the best candidate in the longer term."<ref>{{cite web|last=Seaton|first=Matt|title=Is Greg LeMond the right choice to challenge for the UCI presidency?|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/blog/2012/dec/03/greg-lemond-cycling-uci-presidency|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=December 10, 2012}}</ref></blockquote> LeMond was one of the first prominent professional cyclists to openly decry the sport's descent into the corruption of doping.

==Personal life==
LeMond attended Wooster High School in Reno, NV. His parents are Bob LeMond and Bertha (d. 2006), and he has two sisters, Kathy and Karen. Greg is married to Kathy Morris, and together they have three children <U+2013> two sons (Geoffrey and Scott) and a daughter (Simone).<ref>{{cite web|title=Greg LeMond|url=http://www.nndb.com/people/363/000166862/|work=tracking the entire world <U+2013> database|publisher=NNDB|accessdate=November 27, 2012}}</ref> LeMond and his wife live in [[Medina, Minnesota]].

After retiring from pro cycling, LeMond competed in [[Formula Ford 2000]] series [[auto racing]].<ref name="Malessa"/><ref>{{cite web|last=Kantowski|first=Ron|title=Crashing on the Learning Curve Greg Lemond Trades Two Wheels for Four and Turns into a Real Crack-Up|url=http://www.questia.com/library/1P2-33075972/crashing-on-the-learning-curve-greg-lemond-trades-|publisher=St Louis Post-Dispatch|accessdate=November 27, 2012|date=31|month=May|year=1997|quote="Car racing is still a hobby right now but I want to be serious about it," said LeMond, which explained his presence at Las Vegas Motor Speedway.

LeMond narrated an award-winning documentary for [[Adventures for the Cure]] that same year.

On July 16, 2007, LeMond rode the [[L'<U+00C9>tape du Tour]] [[cyclosportive]] with his son, and found it to be a defining moment in his post-competition life. "I had the time of my life", he said, despite getting "650th place" and being "impressed that I even finished". LeMond continued, "I decided that day that nobody's going to keep me from cycling, not [[Trek Bicycle Corporation|Trek]], not [[Lance Armstrong|Armstrong]], not [[Hein Verbruggen|Verbruggen]], not anybody."<ref name=coventry1>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDy5NLVkliU&feature=related Greg LeMond <U+2013> 'Cycling is dying through Drugs' at Play the Game Conference], 27:00 and 44:00 Play the Game Conference, Coventry University, 2009 Jun 12, retr 2012 10 14</ref> At the time, LeMond was alluding to a series of public and private disputes related to his anti-doping advocacy that hampered his enjoyment of cycling. Especially significant was LeMond's appearance as a USADA witness in the [[Floyd Landis doping case]]. There, on the eve of LeMond's testimony in May 2007, Landis' business manager called LeMond and threatened to disclose that he was a victim of childhood sexual abuse should LeMond appear in court as scheduled.<ref>{{cite web|last=Sumner|first=Jason|title=LeMond drops bombshell at Landis hearing|url=http://velonews.competitor.com/2007/05/news/lemond-drops-bombshell-at-landis-hearing_12271|publisher=VeloNews.com|accessdate=December 11, 2012|date=May 17, 2007|quote=The drama continued when LeMond, under direct questioning from Barnett, said he received a phone call Wednesday night from a mysterious caller, who identified himself only as <U+201C>Uncle Ron.<U+201D> LeMond said he was perplexed at first, but that changed to concern when the caller made direct references to the conversation about sexual abuse that he had with Landis last August.<U+201C>He said <U+2018>Hi Greg, this is your uncle.

Several weeks later, LeMond and his wife Kathy gave an extensive interview to [[Paul Kimmage]] of ''[[The Sunday Times]]''. LeMond provided additional details concerning the circumstances of his 2001 apology to Armstrong, stating that [[Trek Bicycle Corporation|Trek]], the longtime manufacturer and distributor of LeMond Racing Cycles, had threatened to end the relationship at the behest of Armstrong. He described the two years following the forced apology as the worst in his life, marked by self-destructive behavior that ultimately led him to disclose his sexual abuse to his wife and seek help. LeMond also described how being a victim of molestation had impacted both his racing career and his life since.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kimmage|first=Paul|title=Cycle of abuse|url=http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/sport/cycling/article67355.ece|publisher=The Sunday Times|accessdate=December 11, 2012|date=July 1, 2007|quote=<U+201C>I feel very fortunate in many ways,<U+201D> LeMond replies, <U+201C>but if you knew my whole story, it has been a heartache too . . .<U+201D>  He pauses and his eyes suddenly well with tears.

He tries to compose himself and resumes, his voice breaking.  <U+201C>It appears extraordinary, you know . . .
