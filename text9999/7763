The '''Metropolitan Borough of Tameside''' is a [[metropolitan borough]] of [[Greater Manchester]] in [[North West England]]. It is named after the [[River Tame, Greater Manchester|River Tame]] which flows through the borough and spans the towns of [[Ashton-under-Lyne]], [[Audenshaw]], [[Denton, Greater Manchester|Denton]], [[Droylsden]], [[Dukinfield]], [[Hyde, Greater Manchester|Hyde]], [[Mossley]] and [[Stalybridge]]. Its western border is approximately {{convert|4|mi|km|1}} east of [[Manchester city centre]]. It borders [[Derbyshire]] to the east, the [[Metropolitan Borough of Oldham]] to the north, the [[Metropolitan Borough of Stockport]] to the south, and the [[Manchester|City of Manchester]] to the west. Tameside has a population of 214,400.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/statbase/ssdataset.asp?vlnk=9666&More=Y |author=Anon |title=Population estimates 2006 by district |publisher=Statistics.gov.uk |date=2007-08-21 |accessdate=2007-12-21 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071211233916/http://www.statistics.gov.uk/statbase/ssdataset.asp?vlnk=9666&amp;More=Y <!--Added by H3llBot--> |archivedate=2007-12-11}}</ref>

The history of the area extends back to the [[Stone Age]]. There are over 300 [[listed building]]s in Tameside and three [[Scheduled Ancient Monument]]s, which includes [[Buckton Castle|a castle]] of national importance. The settlements in Tameside were small townships centred around agriculture until the advent of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. The towns of the borough grew and became involved in the cotton industry, which dominated the local economy. The current borough was created in 1974 as part of the provisions of the [[Local Government Act 1972]]. Since then the area has been administered by Tameside Borough Council, which has been judged by the [[Audit Commission]] to be "performing strongly".

==History==
The history of the area stretches back up to 10,000 years; there are 22 [[Mesolithic]] sites in Tameside, the oldest dating to around 8,000&nbsp;BC; 21 of the 22 sites are in the hilly uplands in the north east of the borough.<ref>Nevell (1992), pp.&nbsp;21,&nbsp;25.</ref> Evidence of [[Neolithic]]<ref>Nevell (1992), pp.&nbsp;29&ndash;31.</ref> and [[Bronze Age]] activity is more limited in the borough, although the Bronze Age Stalybridge Cairn is the most complete prehistoric funerary monument in the borough.<ref>Nevell (1992), pp.&nbsp;40&ndash;41.</ref> The people in the area changed from hunter-gatherers to farmers around 2500&nbsp;BC&ndash;1500&nbsp;BC due to climate change.<ref>Nevell (1992), p.&nbsp;34.</ref> Werneth Low is the most likely [[Iron Age]] farmstead site in the borough, probably dating to the late 1st millennium&nbsp;BC.<ref>Nevell (1992), p.&nbsp;51.</ref> Before the Roman conquest of Britain in the 1st century&nbsp;AD, the area was probably part of the territory of the [[Brigantes]], the [[Celts|Celtic]] tribe controlling most of what is now north west England.<ref>Nevell (1992), p.&nbsp;55.</ref>

The area came under control of the [[Roman Empire]] in the second half of the 1st century. Roads through the area were established from [[Ardotalia]] [[castra|fort]] in [[Derbyshire]] to [[Mamucium]] (Manchester) west of Tameside and [[Castleshaw Roman fort]] in the north.<ref>Nevell (1992), p.&nbsp;56&ndash;59.</ref> Romano-British finds in the borough include a [[bog body]] in Ashton Moss, occupation sites at Werneth Low, Harridge Pike, Roe Cross, and Mottram.<ref>Nevell (1992), p.&nbsp;60.</ref> A 4th century coin hoard was found in Denton and is one of only four hoards from the 4th century in the Mersey [[river basin|basin]].<ref>Nevell (1992), p.&nbsp;75.</ref> A Byzantine coin from the 6th or 7th centuries, also found in Denton, indicates continued or renewed occupation once the Romans left Britain in the early 5th century.<ref>Nevell (1992), p.&nbsp;76.</ref>

Nico Ditch, an earthwork stretching from Stretford to Ashton-under-Lyne, is evidence of [[Anglo-Saxon]] activity in Tameside. It was probably dug between the 7th and 9th centuries and may have been used as a boundary between the kingdoms of [[Mercia]] and [[Northumbria]].<ref name="Nevell 1991, 77-83">Nevell (1992), pp.&nbsp;77&ndash;83.</ref> Further evidence of Anglo-Saxon era activity in Tameside comes from the derivation of settlement names from [[Old English]] such as -''tun'', meaning farmstead, and ''leah'' meaning clearing.<ref>Nevell (1992), p.&nbsp;85.</ref>

According to the [[Domesday Survey]] of 1086, Tameside was divided into four [[manorialism|manors]], those of Tintwistle, Hollingworth, Werneth, and Mottram. The land east or the River Tame was in the [[Hundreds of Cheshire|Hundred of Hamestan]] in Cheshire and held by the [[Earl of Chester]] while to the west of the river was in the [[Salford (hundred)|Hundred of Salford]] under [[Roger the Poitevin|Roger de Poitevin]].<ref>Nevell (1991), pp.&nbsp;7&ndash;9.</ref> These manors were divided to create further manors, so that by the 13th century. Most of them were owned by local families and remained in the hands of the same families until the 16th century.<ref>Nevell (1991), pp.&nbsp;46&ndash;47.</ref> Manorialism continued as the main for of administration and governance until the mid-19th century.<ref>Nevell (1993), p.&nbsp;13.</ref>

The Industrial Revolution had a significant impact on Tameside; the area, whose main towns had previously been Ashton-under-Lyne and Mottram-in-Longdendale, was transformed from a collection of the rural, farming communities into [[mill town]]s. The towns of Ashton-under-Lyne, Dukinfield, Hyde, Mossley and Stalybridge have been described as "amongst the most famous mills towns in the North West".<ref name="McNiel & Nevell">McNiel and Nevell (2005), p.&nbsp;54.</ref> With only a brief interruption for the [[Lancashire Cotton Famine]] of 1861 to 1865, factories producing and processing textiles were the main industry in Tameside from the late-18th century until the mid-20th century.<ref name="McNiel & Nevell"/><ref>Nevell (1993), p.&nbsp;170.</ref>

In 1964, Dukinfield Borough Council convened a meeting of neighbouring local authorities with the aim of formulating a policy of cross-authority social improvement for the districts in the Tame Valley.<ref name="Frangopulo168"/> Following [[deindustrialisation]], the area had suffered "gross-neglect" and had large areas of housing unsuitable for human habitation.<ref name="Frangopulo168">{{Harvnb|Frangopulo|1977|p=168}}.</ref> This joint enterprise comprised the nine districts that would become Tameside ten years later, plus the [[County Borough of Stockport]].<ref name="Frangopulo168"/> This collective agreed on creating "a linear park in the valley [of the River Tame] for the use of the townspeople and as a major recreational resource within the Manchester metropolis".<ref name="Frangopulo168"/>

Tameside was created on 1 April 1974, by the [[Local Government Act 1972]] as one of the ten metropolitan districts of Greater Manchester. It took over the local government functions of nine districts which were formerly in the [[Administrative counties of England|administrative counties]] of [[Lancashire]] and of [[Cheshire]].<ref>HMSO.  Local Government Act 1972.  1972 c.70</ref> In 1986 Tameside effectively became a [[unitary authority]] with the abolition of the [[Greater Manchester County Council]].

A name for the metropolitan borough proved problematic.<ref name="Clark102"/> The [[Redcliffe-Maud Report]] had used the name Ashton-Hyde, but double-barrelled names were prohibited for the new districts.<ref name="Clark102"/> Had Ashton-under-Lyne been a [[county borough]], or had had a less common name, "it might have been chosen as the new name" for the new district.<ref name="Clark102"/> The eight other towns objected, adamant that "a new name should be found".<ref name="Clark102"/> Thirty suggestions were put forward, including Brigantia, Clarendon, Hartshead, Kayborough, Tame, Ninetowns, and West Pennine, with Hartshead (with reference to [[Hartshead Pike]]) being the most popular throughout most of the consultation period.<ref name="Clark102"/> However, the name Tameside (with reference to the River Tame, but a  concocted name with no historical basis) won 15 votes to Hartshead's 10 in a final stage of voting.<ref name="Clark102">{{Harvnb|Clark|1973|p=102}}.</ref>

The borough underwent a boundary review in 2002. The review altered the areas covered by some [[ward (division)|wards]] to ensure councillors represented roughly equal numbers.<ref>{{cite web |title=Boundary shake-up means 'all out' vote |work=[[Manchester Evening News]] |url=http://www.tamesideadvertiser.co.uk/news/s/382238_boundary_shakeup_means_all_out_vote |date=29&nbsp;August 2002}} Retrieved on 4&nbsp;September 2008.</ref> Between 12&nbsp;October 2006&ndash;8&nbsp;January 2007, a dispersal order was enforced in the Dukinfield and Newton Hyde areas of the borough. The move was designed to reduce anti-social behaviour. A representative of Stalybridge police post said "Due to the serious nature of recent incidents in Dukinfield and Newton Hyde involving a number of confrontations between large groups of youths, the decision has been made to introduce a Dispersal Order".<ref>{{cite web|title=The Tameside Citizen: Orders to tackle crime and disorder |url=http://www.tameside.gov.uk/thecitizen/issue39/page3 |author=Tameside Metropolitan Borough Council |publisher=Tameside.gov.uk |date=16&nbsp;January 2007}} Retrieved on 4&nbsp;September 2008.</ref>
