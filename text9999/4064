'''South Dakota''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-South Dakota.ogg|<U+02CC>|s|a<U+028A>|<U+03B8>|_|d|<U+0259>|<U+02C8>|k|o<U+028A>|t|<U+0259>}}) is a state located in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern region]] of the United States. It is named after the [[Lakota people|Lakota]] and Dakota [[Sioux]] [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] tribes.  South Dakota is the [[List of U.S. states and territories by area|17th most extensive]], but the [[List of U.S. states and territories by population|5th least populous]] and the [[List of U.S. states and territories by population density|5th least densely populated]] of the [[50 United States]].  Once the southern portion of the [[Dakota Territory]], South Dakota became a state on November 2, 1889.  [[Pierre, South Dakota|Pierre]] is the state capital and [[Sioux Falls]], with a population of nearly 160,000, is South Dakota's largest city.

South Dakota is bordered by the states of [[North Dakota]], [[Minnesota]], [[Iowa]], [[Nebraska]], [[Wyoming]], and [[Montana]]. The state is bisected by the [[Missouri River]], dividing South Dakota into two geographically and socially distinct halves, known to residents as "[[East River (South Dakota)|East River]]" and "[[West River (South Dakota)|West River]]".<ref name=eastwestriver>Hasselstrom, pp. 2<U+2013>4.</ref> Eastern South Dakota is home to most of the state's population, and fertile soil in this area is used to grow a variety of crops. West of the Missouri, [[ranch]]ing is the predominant agricultural activity, and the economy is more dependent on tourism and defense spending. The [[Black Hills]], a group of low pine-covered mountains, is located in the southwest part of the state. The Black Hills are sacred to the Sioux. [[Mount Rushmore]], a major tourist destination, is located there. Other attractions in the southwest include [[Badlands National Park|Badlands]] and [[Wind Cave National Park|Wind Cave]] national parks, [[Custer State Park]], the [[Crazy Horse Memorial]], and historic [[Deadwood, South Dakota|Deadwood]]. South Dakota experiences a temperate [[continental climate]], with four distinct seasons and precipitation ranging from moderate in the east to semi-arid in the west. The ecology of the state features species typical of a North American [[grassland]] biome.

Humans have inhabited the area for several millennia, with the Sioux becoming dominant by the early 19th century. In the late 19th century, European-American settlement intensified after a [[Black Hills Gold Rush|gold rush]] in the Black Hills and the construction of railroads from the east. Encroaching miners and settlers caused conflict that triggered a number of [[Indian Wars]], ending with the [[Wounded Knee Massacre]] in 1890. Key events in the 20th century included the [[Dust Bowl]] and [[Great Depression]], increased federal spending during the 1940s and 50s for agriculture and defense, and an industrialization of agriculture which has much reduced family farming. While several [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[United States Senate|senators]] have represented South Dakota for multiple terms at the federal level, the state government is largely dominated by the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], whose nominees have carried South Dakota in each of the most recent eleven [[United States presidential election|presidential elections]]. Historically dominated by an agricultural economy and a rural lifestyle, South Dakota has recently sought to diversify its economy to attract and retain residents.  South Dakota's history and rural character still strongly influence the culture of the state.

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of South Dakota}}
[[File:South Dakota general map 2.png|left|thumb|Terrain and primary geographic features of South Dakota]]
South Dakota is situated in the north-central United States, and is considered a part of the [[Midwest]] by the U.S. Census Bureau;<ref>[http://www.census.gov/geo/www/us_regdiv.pdf Census Regions and Divisions of the United States], U.S. Census Bureau.

The [[Missouri River]] is the largest and longest river in the state. Other major South Dakota rivers include the [[Cheyenne River|Cheyenne]], [[James River (Dakotas)|James]], [[Big Sioux River|Big Sioux]], and [[White River (South Dakota)|White]] Rivers. Eastern South Dakota has many natural lakes, mostly created by periods of glaciation.<ref>{{Cite web| title = Eastern South Dakota Wetlands | publisher=United States Geological Survey | accessdate =January 25, 2009 | url = http://www.npwrc.usgs.gov/resource/wetlands/eastwet/overview.htm}}</ref> Additionally, dams on the Missouri River create four large reservoirs: [[Oahe Dam|Lake Oahe]], [[Lake Sharpe]], [[Lake Francis Case]], and [[Lewis and Clark Lake]].

===Regions and geology===
[[File:Thunder butte SD.jpg|thumb|right|Much of western South Dakota is covered by grasslands and features [[butte]]s such as [[Thunder Butte]], shown above.]]
South Dakota can generally be divided into three regions: eastern South Dakota, western South Dakota, and the [[Black Hills]].<ref>Thompson (ed.), p. 14.</ref> The Missouri River serves as a boundary in terms of geographic, social, and political differences between eastern and western South Dakota, and the geography of the Black Hills differs from its surroundings to such an extent that it can be considered separate from the rest of western South Dakota. South Dakotans also at times combine the Black Hills with the rest of western South Dakota, and refer to the two resulting regions, divided by the Missouri, as [[West River (South Dakota)|West River]] and [[East River (South Dakota)|East River]].<ref name=eastwestriver/><ref name=NYTimesEastWest/>

Eastern South Dakota generally features higher precipitation and lower topography than the western part of the state. Smaller geographic regions of this area include the [[Coteau des Prairies]], the [[Dissected Till Plains]], and the James River Valley. The Coteau des Prairies is a plateau bordered on the east by the [[Minnesota River]] Valley and on the west by the James River Basin.<ref>Thompson (ed.), pp. 17<U+2013>18.</ref> Further to the west, the James River Basin is mostly low, flat, highly eroded land, following the flow of the [[James River (Dakotas)|James River]] through South Dakota from north to south.<ref>Schell, pp. 4<U+2013>6.</ref> The Dissected Till Plains, an area of rolling hills and fertile soil that covers much of Iowa and Nebraska, also extends into the southeastern corner of South Dakota. Layers deposited during the [[Pleistocene]] epoch, starting around two million years ago, cover most of eastern South Dakota.<ref name=NSUgeology/> These are the youngest rock and sediment layers in the state, and are the product of several successive periods of [[glacier|glaciation]] which deposited a large amount of rocks and soil, known as [[till]], over the area.<ref name=pleistocene>{{Cite web| title = Pleistocene Deposits | publisher=South Dakota Department of Environment & Natural Resources | accessdate =November 28, 2008 | url = http://www.sdgs.usd.edu/geology/pleistocene.html | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080116121210/http://www.sdgs.usd.edu/geology/pleistocene.html | archivedate = January 16, 2008}}</ref>

[[File:Black Elk Wilderness South Dakota 5.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Black Hills]], a low mountain range, is located in southwestern South Dakota.]]
The [[Great Plains]] cover most of the western two-thirds of South Dakota. West of the Missouri River the landscape becomes more arid and rugged, consisting of rolling hills, plains, ravines, and steep flat-topped hills called [[butte]]s.<ref>Schell, p. 6.</ref> In the south, east of the Black Hills, lie the South Dakota [[Badlands National Park|Badlands]]. Erosion from the Black Hills, marine skeletons which fell to the bottom of a large shallow sea that once covered the area and volcanic material all contribute to the geology of this area.<ref name=NSUgeology/><ref name=mesozoic>{{Cite web| title = Mesozoic Formations | publisher=South Dakota Department of Environment & Natural Resources | accessdate =November 28, 2008 | url = http://www.sdgs.usd.edu/geology/mesozoic.html | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080213170116/http://www.sdgs.usd.edu/geology/mesozoic.html | archivedate = February 13, 2008}}</ref><ref name=tertiary>{{Cite web| title = Tertiary Formations | publisher=South Dakota Department of Environment & Natural Resources | accessdate =November 28, 2008 | url = http://www.sdgs.usd.edu/geology/tertiary.html | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070925065217/http://www.sdgs.usd.edu/geology/tertiary.html | archivedate = September 25, 2007}}</ref>

The Black Hills are in the southwestern part of South Dakota and extend into Wyoming. This range of low mountains covers {{convert|6000|sqmi|km2|abbr=on}} with peaks that rise from 2,000 to 4,000&nbsp;feet (600 to 1,200&nbsp;m) above their bases.

===Climate===
South Dakota has a [[continental climate]] with four distinct seasons, ranging from cold, dry winters to hot and semi-humid summers. During the summers, the average high temperature throughout the state is often close to 90&nbsp;<U+00B0>F (32&nbsp;<U+00B0>C), although it cools to near 60&nbsp;<U+00B0>F (15&nbsp;<U+00B0>C) at night. It is not unusual for South Dakota to have severe hot, dry spells in the summer with the temperature climbing above 100&nbsp;<U+00B0>F (38&nbsp;<U+00B0>C) several times every year.<ref name=SDclimate>{{Cite web| url = http://www5.ncdc.noaa.gov/climatenormals/clim60/states/Clim_SD_01.pdf | title = Climate of South Dakota | publisher=National Climatic Data Center | accessdate =November 26, 2008|format=PDF}}</ref> Winters are cold with January high temperatures averaging below freezing and low temperatures averaging below 10&nbsp;<U+00B0>F (- 12&nbsp;<U+00B0>C) in most of the state. The highest recorded temperature is {{convert|120|F|C}} at [[Usta, South Dakota|Usta]] on July 15, 2006 and the lowest recorded temperature is {{convert|-58|F|C}} at [[McIntosh, South Dakota|McIntosh]] on February 17, 1936. 

Average annual [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] in South Dakota ranges from [[Semi-arid climate|semi-arid]] conditions in the northwestern part of the state (around 15&nbsp;inches, or 381&nbsp;mm) to semi-humid around the southeast portion of the state (around 25&nbsp;inches, or 635&nbsp;mm),<ref name=SDclimate/> although a small area centered on [[Lead, South Dakota|Lead]] in the Black Hills has the highest precipitation at nearly 30&nbsp;inches (762&nbsp;mm) a year.<ref>{{Cite web| title = Precipitation Normals (1971<U+2013>2000) | publisher=South Dakota State University | accessdate =November 26, 2008 | url = http://climate.sdstate.edu/archives/data/pptnormals.shtm}}</ref>

South Dakota summers bring frequent, sometimes severe, thunderstorms with high winds, thunder, and hail. The eastern part of the state is often considered part of [[Tornado Alley]],<ref>{{Cite web| title = Tornado Climatology | publisher=[[National Severe Storms Laboratory]] | accessdate =February 7, 2009 | url = http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/primer/tornado/tor_climatology.html}}</ref> and South Dakota experiences an average of 30 tornadoes each year.<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif | title = Annual Average Number of Tornadoes, 1953<U+2013>2004 | publisher=National Climatic Data Center | accessdate =June 25, 2009}}</ref> Severe weather in the form of [[blizzard]]s and [[ice storm]]s occur often during winter.

===National Parks and Monuments===
[[File:Dean Franklin - 06.04.03 Mount Rushmore Monument (by-sa).jpg|right|thumb|[[Mount Rushmore National Memorial]] in the Black Hills]]
South Dakota contains several sites that are administered by the [[National Park Service]].
Two [[national parks]] have been established in South Dakota, both located in the southwestern part of the state.

==History==

{{Main|History of South Dakota}}
Humans have lived in what is today South Dakota for at least several thousand years. The first inhabitants were [[Paleoindian]] [[hunter-gatherer]]s, and disappeared from the area around 5000 BC.<ref>Schell, p. 15.</ref> Between 500&nbsp;AD and 800&nbsp;AD, a semi-nomadic people known as the Mound Builders lived in central and eastern South Dakota. In the 14th century, the [[Crow Creek Massacre]] occurred, in which several hundred men, women, and children were killed near the Missouri River.<ref name=DeloriaNeal>Deloria and Neal (eds.), p. 161.</ref> By 1500 the [[Arikara]] (or Ree) had settled in much of the Missouri River valley.<ref>Schell, pp. 16<U+2013>18.</ref> European contact with the area began in 1743, when the [[Louis-Joseph Gaultier de La V<U+00E9>rendrye|LaVerendrye]] brothers explored the region. The LaVerendrye group buried a plate near the site of modern day Pierre, claiming the region for France as part of [[Louisiana (New France)|greater Louisiana]].<ref>Schell, pp. 28<U+2013>29.</ref> By the early 19th century, the [[Sioux]] had largely replaced the Arikara as the dominant group in the area.<ref>Schell, pp. 18<U+2013>21.</ref>

In 1803, the United States purchased the [[Louisiana Territory]], an area that included most of South Dakota, from [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], and President [[Thomas Jefferson]] organized a group commonly referred to as the "[[Lewis and Clark Expedition]]" to explore the newly-acquired region.<ref>Thompson (ed.), pp. 56<U+2013>57.</ref> In 1817, an American fur trading post was set up at present-day [[Fort Pierre]], beginning continuous American settlement of the area.<ref name=SDChrono>{{Cite web| title = Chronology of South Dakota History | publisher=South Dakota Historical Society | accessdate =September 3, 2007 | url = http://www.sdhistory.org/soc/soc_hist.htm |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070901170704/http://www.sdhistory.org/soc/soc_hist.htm |archivedate = September 1, 2007}}</ref> In 1855, the U.S. Army bought Fort Pierre but abandoned it the following year in favor of [[Fort Randall]] to the south.<ref name=SDChrono/> Settlement by Americans and Europeans was by this time increasing rapidly, and in 1858 the [[Yankton Sioux]] signed the [[List of United States treaties|1858 Treaty]], ceding most of present-day eastern South Dakota to the United States.<ref>Thompson (ed.), pp. 69<U+2013>71.</ref>
[[Image:Deadwood13.jpg|thumb|left|[[Deadwood, South Dakota|Deadwood]], like many other [[Black Hills]] towns, was founded after the discovery of gold.]]

Land speculators founded two of eastern South Dakota's largest present-day cities: [[Sioux Falls]] in 1856<ref>Schell, pp. 72<U+2013>73.</ref> and [[Yankton, South Dakota|Yankton]] in 1859.<ref>Schell, p. 72.</ref> In 1861, the [[Dakota Territory]] was established by the United States government (this initially included [[North Dakota]], South Dakota, and parts of [[Montana]] and [[Wyoming]]).<ref>{{Cite web| title = Dakota Territory History | publisher=Union County Historical Society | accessdate =September 3, 2007 | url = http://www.acsnet.com/~jkjar/dt_history.htm}}</ref>  Settlement of the area, mostly by people from the eastern United States as well as western and northern Europe, increased rapidly,<ref>Schell, pp 168<U+2013>170.</ref>  especially after the completion of an eastern railway link to Yankton in 1873.<ref>Schell, p. 113.</ref> In 1874 gold was discovered in the [[Black Hills]] during a military expedition led by [[George A. Custer]]<ref>Schell, p. 129.</ref><ref>Schell, pp. 140<U+2013>144.</ref> and miners and explorers began illegally entering land promised to the Lakota.

Custer's expedition took place despite the fact that the US had granted the entire western half of present-day South Dakota ([[West River (South Dakota)|West River]]) to the Sioux in 1868 by the [[Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868)|Treaty of Laramie]] as part of the [[Great Sioux Reservation]]. The Sioux declined to grant mining rights or land in the Black Hills, and war broke out after the U.S. failed to stop white miners and settlers from entering the region. Eventually the US defeated the Sioux and broke up the Great Sioux Reservation into five reservations, settling the Lakota in those areas.<ref name=SDChrono/> (In 1980, the [[United States Supreme Court|US Supreme Court]] and Congress ordered payment to the Lakota for the illegal seizure of the Black Hills. The case remains unsettled, as the Lakota refuse to accept the money and instead insist on the return of the land.)<ref>Thompson (ed.), p. 529.</ref> A growing population caused Dakota Territory to be divided in half and President [[Benjamin Harrison]] signed proclamations formally admitting both South Dakota and North Dakota to the union on November 2, 1889.<ref>Schell, p. 222.</ref><ref name=Thompson116>Thompson (ed.), pp. 115<U+2013>116.</ref> Harrison had the papers shuffled to obscure which one was signed first and the order went unrecorded.<ref name=Thompson116/>

On December 29, 1890, the [[Wounded Knee Massacre]] occurred on the [[Pine Ridge Indian Reservation]]. Commonly cited as the last major armed conflict between the United States and the Lakota Sioux Nation, the massacre resulted in the deaths of at least 146 Sioux, many of them women and children.<ref name=Schell304>Schell, pp. 304<U+2013>305.</ref> 31 U.S. soldiers were also killed in the conflict.<ref name=Schell304/>

[[Image:Dust Bowl - Dallas, South Dakota 1936.jpg|right|thumb|A South Dakota farm during the [[Dust Bowl]], 1936]]
During the 1930s, several economic and climatic conditions combined with disastrous results for South Dakota. A lack of rainfall, extremely high temperatures and inappropriate cultivation techniques produced what was known as the [[Dust Bowl]] in South Dakota and several other plains states. Fertile [[topsoil]] was blown away in massive dust storms, and several harvests were completely ruined.<ref>{{Cite web| title = Drought in the Dust Bowl Years | publisher=National Drought Mitigation Center | accessdate =April 4, 2007 | url = http://drought.unl.edu/whatis/dustbowl.htm}}</ref> The experiences of the Dust Bowl, coupled with local bank [[foreclosure]]s and the general economic effects of the [[Great Depression]], resulted in many South Dakotans leaving the state.  The population of South Dakota declined by more than 7% between 1930 and 1940.<ref>{{Cite web| title = Population of Counties by Decennial Census: 1900 to 1990 | publisher=United States Census Bureau | accessdate =December 14, 2008 | url = http://www.census.gov/population/cencounts/sd190090.txt}}</ref>

Economic stability returned with the U.S. entry into World War II in 1941, when demand for the state's agricultural and industrial products grew as the nation mobilized for war.<ref>Schell, pp. 317<U+2013>320.</ref> In 1944, the [[Pick-Sloan Plan]] was passed as part of the [[Flood Control Act of 1944]] by the U.S. Congress, resulting in the construction of six large dams on the Missouri River, four of which are at least partially located in South Dakota.<ref name=Schell323>Schell, pp. 323<U+2013>325.</ref> Flood control, [[hydroelectricity]], and recreational opportunities such as boating and fishing are provided by the dams and their reservoirs.<ref name=Schell323/>

In recent decades, South Dakota has transformed from a state dominated by agriculture to one with a more diversified economy. The tourism industry has grown considerably since the completion of the interstate system in the 1960s, with the Black Hills becoming more important as a destination. The financial service industry began to grow in the state as well, with [[Citibank]] moving its credit card operations from New York to Sioux Falls in 1981, a move that has since been followed by several other financial companies.  South Dakota was the first state to eliminate [[Usury#Usury statutes in the United States|caps on interest rates]].<ref name=Citibank>Hetland, Cara.

===Population===
The [[United States Census Bureau]] estimates that the population of South Dakota was 824,082 on July 1, 2011, a 1.22% increase since the [[2010 United States Census]].<ref name=PopEstUS>{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/popest/data/state/totals/2011/tables/NST-EST2011-01.csv|title=Annual Estimates of the Resident Population for the United States, Regions, States, and Puerto Rico: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2011|format=[[comma-separated values|CSV]]|work=2011 Population Estimates|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]], Population Division|date=December 2011|accessdate=December 21, 2011}}</ref>  

According to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], as of 2009, South Dakota has an estimated population of 812,383, an increase of 57,548, or 7.6%, since the year 2000.<ref name=SDQuickfacts>{{Cite web| title = State & County QuickFacts (South Dakota) | publisher=United States Census Bureau | accessdate =August 22, 2008 | url = http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/46000.html}}</ref> 7.3% of South Dakota's population was reported as under 5, 24.7% under 18, and 14.4% were 65 or older.<ref name=SDQuickfacts/> Females made up approximately 50.2% of the population.<ref name=SDQuickfacts/> As of the 2000 census, South Dakota ranked fifth-lowest in the nation in both population and population density.<ref name=2010Census/><ref name=PopDens/>
The [[center of population]] of South Dakota is located in [[Buffalo County, South Dakota|Buffalo County]], in the unincorporated county seat of [[Gann Valley, South Dakota|Gannvalley]].<ref>{{Cite web| title = Population and Population Centers by State <U+2013> 2000 | publisher=United States Census Bureau | accessdate =August 18, 2007 | url = http://www.census.gov/geo/www/cenpop/statecenters.txt}}</ref>

===Race and ethnicity===
At the 2010 Census, 84.7% of the population was non-Hispanic White, 8.5% non-Hispanic American Indian and Alaska Native, 1.2% non-Hispanic Black or African American, 0.9% non-Hispanic Asian, 0.1% from some other race (non-Hispanic) and 1.8% of two or more races (non-Hispanic). 2.7% of South Dakota's population was of Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish origin (they may be of any race).

The five largest ancestry groups in South Dakota are [[German-American|German]] (40.7%), [[Norwegian-American|Norwegian]] (15.3%), [[Irish American|Irish]] (10.4%), [[Native American (U.S. Census)|Native American]] (8.3%), and [[English-American|English]] (7.1%).<ref name=CensusSocialStats>{{Cite web| title = Quick Tables | publisher=United States Census Bureau | accessdate =August 29, 2008 | url = http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/QTTable?_bm=n&_lang=en&qr_name=DEC_2000_SF3_U_DP2&ds_name=DEC_2000_SF3_U&geo_id=04000US46}}</ref> German Americans are the largest ancestry group in most parts of the state, especially in [[East River]] (east of the Missouri River), although there are also large Scandinavian-descended populations in some counties.

[[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indians]], largely [[Lakota people|Lakota]], [[Dakota]], and [[Nakota]] (Sioux) are predominant in several counties and comprise 20 per cent of the population in [[West River]]. There are seven large Indian reservations in the state, but this area is diminished from the [[Great Sioux Reservation]] of West River, which the US government had once allocated to the Sioux. South Dakota has the third-highest proportion of Native Americans of any state, behind Alaska and [[New Mexico]].<ref>{{Cite web| title = States Ranked by American Indian and Alaska Native Population, July&nbsp;1, 1999 | publisher=United States Census Bureau | accessdate =December 14, 2008 | url = http://www.census.gov/population/estimates/state/rank/aiea.txt}}</ref> Five of the state's counties are wholly within [[Indian reservation]]s.<ref>{{Cite web| title = Press Releases <U+2013> Uniquely South Dakota | publisher=South Dakota Department of Tourism | accessdate =August 22, 2008 | url = http://www.travelsd.com/Newsroom/pressreleases/uniquelysd.asp?id=356}}</ref> Living standards on many South Dakota reservations are often far below the national average; [[Ziebach County, South Dakota|Ziebach County]] ranked as the poorest county in the nation in 2009.<ref>Garrigan, Mary.

===Growth and rural flight===
South Dakota, in common with other Great Plains states, has been experiencing a falling population in many rural areas over the last several decades, a phenomenon known as "[[rural flight]]" as family farming has decreased. This trend has continued in recent years, with 30 of South Dakota's counties losing population between the 1990 and the 2000 census.<ref name=ODriscoll>[http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/census/sd.htm O'Driscoll, Patrick. "Sioux Falls powers South Dakota growth"], ''[[USA Today]],'' March 12, 2001. (accessed December 16, 2008)</ref> During that time, nine counties experienced a population loss of greater than 10%, with [[Harding County, South Dakota|Harding County]], in the northwest corner of the state, losing nearly 19% of its population.<ref name=ODriscoll/> Low birth rates and a lack of younger immigration has caused the median age of many of these counties to increase. In 24 counties, at least 20% of the population is over the age of 65,<ref>{{Cite web| title = South Dakota state and county demographic profiles | publisher=South Dakota State University | accessdate =December 16, 2008 | url = http://agbionews.sdstate.edu/story.cfm?id=4420}}</ref> compared with a national rate of 12.8%.<ref name=SDQuickfacts/>

The effect of rural flight has not been spread evenly through South Dakota, however. Although most rural counties and small towns have lost population, the Sioux Falls area, the larger counties along [[Interstate 29 in South Dakota|Interstate 29]], the Black Hills, and many [[Indian reservations]] have all gained population.<ref name=ODriscoll/> [[Lincoln County, South Dakota|Lincoln County]] near Sioux Falls is the ninth-fastest growing county (by percentage) in the United States.<ref>{{Cite web| title = 100 Fastest Growing Counties | publisher=United States Census Bureau | accessdate =April 10, 2007 | url = http://www.census.gov/popest/counties/CO-EST2004-09.html}}</ref> The growth in these areas has compensated for losses in the rest of the state,<ref name=ODriscoll/> and South Dakota's total population continues to increase steadily, albeit at a slower rate than the national average.<ref name=SDQuickfacts/>

===Religion===
The largest denominations by number of adherents in 2000 were the Roman Catholic Church with 181,434 members; the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]] (ELCA) with 121,871 members; and the [[United Methodist Church]] (UMC) with 37,280 members.<ref>{{Cite web| title = State Membership Report <U+2013> South Dakota | publisher=Association of Religion Data Archives | accessdate =November 30, 2008 | url = http://www.thearda.com/mapsReports/reports/state/46_2000.asp}}</ref> (Both the ELCA and UMC are specific denominations within the broader terms 'Lutheran' and 'Methodist', respectively.)
The results of a 2001 survey, in which South Dakotans were asked to identify their religion, include:<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://www.gc.cuny.edu/faculty/research_briefs/aris/key_findings.htm | title=American Religious Identification Survey | work=Exhibit 15 | publisher=The Graduate Center, City University of New York | accessdate =April 6, 2007}}</ref>

[[Image:SDethnl1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ethanol]] plant in [[Turner County, South Dakota|Turner County]]]]
Agriculture has historically been a key component of the South Dakota economy. Although other industries have expanded rapidly in recent decades, agricultural production is still very important to the state's economy, especially in rural areas. The five most valuable agricultural products in South Dakota are cattle, [[maize|corn (maize)]], [[soybeans]], wheat, and [[pig|hogs]].<ref>{{Cite web| title = State Fact Sheets: South Dakota | publisher=[[United States Department of Agriculture]] | accessdate =June 25, 2009 | url = http://www.ers.usda.gov/statefacts/SD.htm}}</ref> Agriculture-related industries such as [[meat packing]] and [[ethanol]] production also have a considerable economic impact on the state.

Another important sector in South Dakota's economy is tourism. Many travel to view the attractions of the state, particularly those in the Black Hills region, such as historic [[Deadwood, South Dakota|Deadwood]], [[Mount Rushmore]], and the nearby state and national parks. One of the largest tourist events in the state is the annual [[Sturgis Motorcycle Rally]].

Like that of other U.S. states, the structure of the government of South Dakota follows the same [[separation of powers]] as [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]], with executive, [[Legislature|legislative]], and [[Judiciary|judicial]] branches. The structure of the state government is laid out in the [[Constitution of South Dakota]], the highest law in the state.

[[Laura Ingalls Wilder]], whose semi-autobiographical books center around her experiences as a child and young adult on the frontier, is one of South Dakota's best-known writers.

South Dakota has also produced several notable artists. [[Harvey Dunn]] grew up on a homestead near [[Manchester, South Dakota|Manchester]] in the late 19th century.

==Sports and recreation==
=== Organized sports ===
Because of its low population, South Dakota does not host any major league professional sports franchises. The state does have a number of minor league teams, all of which play in either Sioux Falls or Rapid City. Sioux Falls is currently home to four teams: the [[Sioux Falls Fighting Pheasants]] (a baseball team formerly known as the Canaries), the [[Sioux Falls Skyforce]] (basketball), the [[Sioux Falls Stampede]] ([[hockey]]), and the [[Sioux Falls Storm]] ([[arena football]]).<ref>Vandrovec, Terry.

Universities in South Dakota host a variety of sports programs. For many years, South Dakota was one of the only states in the country without a [[NCAA]] [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] football or basketball team.
