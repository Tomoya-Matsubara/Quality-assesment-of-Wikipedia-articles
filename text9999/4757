== History & Origin ==

[[File:Area_of_Bais_Rajput.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Area of where the [[Bais Rajput]] reside in [[South Asia]]. The darker the red, the denser the population of [[Bais Rajputs]] per sq/km.]]

The [[Bais Rajputs]] are considered to be [[Suryavanshi]]. They are an ancient [[Hindu]] warrior caste. Their eponymous ancestor was [[Gautamiputra Satakarni]] also known as [[Shalivahana]], the king of Shalikot  presently known as [[Sialkot]] in [[Pakistan]]. [[Shalivahana]] is the mythic son of a snake who conquered the great Raja Vikramaditya of [[Ujjain]] in 55 AD and established his own area. The clan claims to have come from Manji Paithan in the Dekhan in 78 AD when [[Shalivahana]] was king.<ref>Crooke, William (1896). The Tribes and Castes of the North-western Provinces and Oudh. Calcutta, Office of the Superintendent of Government Printing. ISBN 81-206-1210-8.</ref> This was the [[Saka]] era and [[Shalivahana]] was the leader of the [[Saka]] [[nomads]] who invaded [[Gujarat]] on two occasions before and shortly after the beginning of the [[Christian]] era.<ref>Crooke, William (1896). The Tribes and Castes of the North-western Provinces and Oudh. Calcutta, Office of the Superintendent of Government Printing. ISBN 81-206-1210-8.</ref> It makes sense for Shesh-Vansh to be called Suryavanshi because they are descendants of [[Lakshman]] Ji, brother of [[Sri Rama]], who is believed to be an avtar of ''Sheshnag''. 

The [[Bais Rajput]] come in the list of casts in the super cast known as the [[Dhangar]] [[Rajput]], formed by wealthy [[Kshatriyas]] who moved to the regions of The [[Hill States]] of Punjab and [[Azad Kashmir]] and settled there.

The Bais Rajputs are now a numerous clan and have given their name to an extensive district Baiswada in the [[Doab]], the land between the [[Ganga]] and [[Yamuna]]. They are found all over the United Provinces and [[Bihar]].<ref>Crooke, William (1896). The Tribes and Castes of the North-western Provinces and Oudh.

The [[Bais Rajput]] come under the list of the super [[Rajput]] cast: The '[[Dhangar]]' meaning 'who is wealthy'. These Dhangar Rajput [[Kshatriyas]], during times of hardship, migrated from origins in the [[Indian]] state of [[Maharashtra]] to hills and forests in The [[Hill States]] of Punjab and [[Azad Kashmir]]<ref>Dhangar Samaj Prachin Eitihas va Kul Gotra, Ganpatrao Kolekar, 1992.(Marathi)</ref>

Bais are considered also to be Nagvanshi]]. Baiswara is group of 365 villages comprising mostly Bais clansmen. King of [[Thanesar]] Harshvardhan united the whole nation and chose his capital as [[Kannauj]].

==Custom==

The principal hero of the [[Bais]] was Tilokchand, who is supposed to have come from the Central Provinces. He lived about [[1400 AD]] and he was the premier [[Raja]] of [[Oudh]]. He extended his dominions over all the tract known as Baiswara which comprises the bulk of the [[Rae Bareli]] and [[Unnao]] Districts. The descendants of Tilokchand form a separate subdivision of [[Bais]] [[Rajputs]] known as Tilokchandi Bais. 

The [[Bais]] [[Rajput]] intermarry with [[Rajput clans]] namley     the    [[Bargujar]], [[Chauhan]], [[Kachwaha]], [[Chandel]], [[Gautam]].

The [[Bais]] [[Rajput]] live in groups of villages named ''Baiswara'', where [[Baiis]] [[Rajput]] have ever migrated they have also formed such coalition of villages, namely the move to The [[Hills States]] of Punjab and [[Azad Kashmir]]. Baiswara are easily recognisable as most villages prize the name '[[Bais]]' in the name of their village for example: ''Kalyal Bhainsi'' ([[Azad Kashmir]]) or ''Bais Godam'' ([[India]]).



The 'Bais' 'Rajput' clan never kill snakes, which they hold in great reverence. The Baise believe that no snake has destroyed, or ever can destroy, one of the clan. They seem to take no precautions against snake bite except hanging a vessel of water at the head of the sufferer, with a small tube at the bottom, from which the water is poured on his head for as long as he can bear it. So important is the snake to the Bais that the cobra forms part of the clan's flag.

== Bais Rajput & Religion ==

In the modern day and age the clan consists of two major religious groups: [[Hindus]] and [[Muslims]]. There are also [[Sikh]] and [[Buddhist]] [[Bais]] [[Rajput]] but this is a minority in comparison to the latter two.
The [[Bais]] [[Rajput]] started of as Hindus as did all in when the cast system came into place a very long time ago in India. Even so today there are very many [[Hindu]] [[Bais]] [[Rajput]] as over half [[Bais]] [[Rajput]] are [[Hindu]]. Directing from the lineage of the [[Kshatriyas]] the [[Bais]] [[Rajput]] claim to be descendent of many Hindu gods.
As Islam spread over India quite a few areas in the dynasty of the [[Bais]] [[Rajput]] converted in the 14th and 15th century and still to this day remain [[Muslims]]. Also with the move of many to The [[Hill States]] of Punjab and [[Azad Kashmir]] most if not all converted to Islam as Islam was the dominant religion in the area. With the coming of the Mughals the many [[Bais Rajputs]] also accepted the invitation from Islam.
Some Muslim [[Bais]] [[Rajput]] Thakurs experience problems in expressing their Thakur identity following the religion of Islam as it does not allow one to be self extravagant and flamboyant in acts.
There have been prominent [[Sikh]] [[Bais Rajput]] and most [[Sikh]] [[Bais Rajput]] reside in the state if [[Punjab, India]]. The [[Buddhist]] aslso had influence on many [[Bais Rajputs]] such as [[Harsha]], there are very few if any [[Buddhist]] [[Bais Rajputs]].
Other religions also include: [[Animists]] and followers of the [[Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> faith]].

== International community ==
Many [[Bais]] [[Rajputs]] live in countries other than India and Pakistan such as the United Kingdom, Canada and America.
