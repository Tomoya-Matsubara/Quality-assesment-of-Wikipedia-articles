'''Coll''' is a small [[island]] (about 21 km long and 5 km wide) in the [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[Inner Hebrides]], west of [[Isle of Mull|Mull]]. It has a population of less than 200. The island has a small village, [[Arinagour]], from which [[ferry|ferries]] operated by [[Caledonian MacBrayne]] sail to [[Scarinish]] on [[Tiree]] and to [[Oban]] on the mainland.<ref>[http://www.calmac.co.uk/coll Caledonian MacBrayne route information]</ref> (The normal journey from Oban on the mainland takes about two hours, but in stormy winter weather it can sometimes take much longer.)

Coll is known for its sandy [[beach]]es, which rise to form large [[sand dune]]s, for its [[corncrake]]s, and for two [[castle]]s, both named [[Breachacha Castle]]. The older dates from the [[fifteenth century]].

Coll was home to a branch of the [[Clan MacLean]] for 500 years, not all of which were peaceful. In 1590 the MacLeans of Duart invaded their cousins on Coll with the intention of taking the island for themselves. A battle was fought at Breachacha Castle where the Coll clan overwhelmed the Duarts and chopped off their heads and threw them in the stream which is still known as <U+2018>the stream of the heads<U+2019>. The Macleans of Coll retained their baronial fief and Castle of Breachacha until [[1848]] when Alexander Maclean of Coll emigrated to [[KwaZulu-Natal Province|Natal]] where he died unmarried.

The population of Coll was much higher in the past; in the late 1700s there were about 1,000 people supported by agriculture and fishing. During the [[Highland Clearances]] of the [[1830s]] and [[1840s]], most of the population left, many of them moving to [[Australia]], [[Canada]] or [[South Africa]].

* There is an extensive [[RSPB]] reserve towards the west end of the island.<ref>[http://www.rspb.org.uk/reserves/guide/c/coll/index.asp RSBP Guide to Coll]</ref>  One of the main attractions is that the rare [[corncrake]] can be seen in this area.  Traditional local farming practices have helped this once common British bird to survive.

* Coll is also home to [[Project Trust]], a [[gap year]] organisation that sends school leavers abroad for a year's voluntary work, they send 17-19 year olds on a whole year abroad, and have extensive selection and training weeks.<ref>[http://www.projecttrust.org.uk/ Project Trust]</ref>
