In 1995, Paul passed the [[American Board of Ophthalmology]] (ABO) boards on his first attempt and earned board-certification under the ABO for a decade. In 1997, to protest the ABO's decision to [[grandfather clause|grandfather]] in older ophthalmologists and not require them to recertify, Paul, along with 200&nbsp;ophthalmologists formed the National Board of Ophthalmology (NBO).<ref>{{cite web|last=Weigel|first=David|title=Rand Paul: I passed my ophthalmology certification, but took a stand against the way the board operates|publisher=''The Washington Post''|date=2010-06-14|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/right-now/2010/06/rand_paul_i_passed_my_opthamal.html|accessdate=2011-03-22}}</ref> Paul's ophthalmology board is not officially recognized by the [[American Board of Medical Specialties]] (ABMS).

Paul later recreated the board in September 2005, three months before his certification from the ABO was scheduled to expire. His ABO certification lapsed on December 31, 2005.

In the beginning of 2009, Paul was the focus of an online grassroots movement to [[Draft (politics)|draft]] him in a bid to replace beleaguered Republican Kentucky senator [[Jim Bunning]]. The news of his potential candidacy became a topic of national interest and was discussed in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''<ref>{{cite news|author=|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2009/03/ron-paul-defend.html |title=Ron Paul defends earmarks, says anti-pork McCain is just grandstanding |publisher=Latimesblogs.latimes.com |date=March 11, 2009 |accessdate=November 3, 2010}}</ref> and locally in the Kentucky press.<ref name=ky5>[http://kywordsmith.com/#/rand-paul-issues/4533680792 "Rand Paul Set To Launch"], www.kywordsmith.com.

On May 1, 2009, Paul officially confirmed that if Bunning, whose fundraising in 2009 has matched his poor numbers in opinion polling for the 2010 election,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2009/05/bunning-retirement-might-not-save-gop.html|title=Bunning Retirement Might Not Save GOP in Kentucky|agency=FiveThirtyEight.com|first=Nate|last=Silver|date=May 1, 2009}}</ref> declined to seek a third term, he would almost certainly run in the [[United States Republican Party|Republican Party]] primary to succeed him,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.wbko.com/news/headlines/44184752.html|title=Dr. Rand Paul Ready To Enter Primary For Bunning's Seat|agency=WBKO|date=May 1, 2009}}</ref> and formed an [[exploratory committee]] soon after, while still promising to stay out of the race if Bunning had ultimately decided to run for re-election. Paul made this announcement on [[MSNBC|MSNBC's]] ''[[The Rachel Maddow Show (TV series)|The Rachel Maddow Show]]'', though a local Kentucky news site first broke the news.<ref>[http://kywordsmith.com/#/paul-forms-exploratary-cmte/4533578818 "Rand Paul To Form Exploratory Committee For U.S. Senate Bid..."], www.kywordsmith.com. May 14, 2009</ref>

On July 28, 2009, Bunning announced that he would not run for re-election, after facing insufficient fundraising. This announcement left only Paul and [[Kentucky Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Trey Grayson]] as the remaining candidates for the Republican nomination,<ref>{{cite web|last=Memoli |first=Mike |url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/politics_nation/2009/06/ky_sen_potential_bunning_chall.html |title=Politics Nation <U+2013> KY Sen: Potential Bunning Challenger Passes On Race |publisher=RealClearPolitics |date=June 15, 2009 |accessdate=May 19, 2010}}</ref> with Paul announcing on August 5, 2009 that he would officially run for the U.S. Senate as a Republican.

====Early fundraising success====
On August 20, 2009, Paul's grassroots planned a [[moneybomb]] to kick off his campaign for United States Senate. The official campaign took in $433,509 in 24 hours. His website reported that this set a new record in Kentucky's political fundraising history in a 24-hour period.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.randpaul2010.com/2009/08/rand-bomb-breaks-record/ |title=Rand Bomb Breaks Record |publisher=Randpaul2010.com |date=August 22, 2009 |accessdate=November 3, 2010}}</ref>

A second "moneybomb" was held on September 23, 2009, to counter a D.C. fundraiser being held for primary opponent Trey Grayson, by 23 Republican United States Senators, 17 of whom voted for the bank bailout.<ref>[http://bluegrasspolitics.bloginky.com/2009/08/31/web-site-promotes-fight-to-raise-money-for-paul/ "Lexington Herald-Leader <U+2013> Web site promotes 'fight' to raise money for Paul"], Bluegrass Politics September 1, 2009</ref> The theme was a [[UFC]] "fight" between Paul and "We the People" vs. Trey Grayson and the "D.C.

Later in the campaign, Paul claimed his pledge to not take money from lobbyists and Senators who had voted for the bailout was only a "primary pledge";<ref>{{cite news|last=Schreiner|first=Bruce|title=Rand Paul flips, seeks money from bailout senators|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/feedarticle/9139316|newspaper=The Guardian|date=June 23, 2010|location=London}}</ref> he subsequently held a DC fundraiser with the same Senators who had been the target of the September 23, 2009 "moneybomb."  Paul ended up raising some $3 million during the primary period.

===General campaign===
Main Article: ''[[United States Senate election in Kentucky, 2010]]''

In the 2010 general election, Paul faced [[Kentucky Attorney General]] [[Jack Conway]]. The campaign attracted $8.5 million dollars in contributions from outside groups, of which $6 million was spent to help Rand Paul and $2.5 million to help Conway. This money influx was in addition to the money spent by the candidates themselves: $6 million by Paul and $4.7 million by Conway. <ref>{{cite news|last=Steitzer|first=Stephanie|title=Outside groups spend big in U.S. Senate race|url=http://www.courier-journal.com/article/20101029/NEWS0106/310290083?nclick_check=1|newspaper=Courier-Journal|date=Oct 29, 2010}}</ref> <ref>{{cite web|title=Super PACs|url=http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/outside-spending/race/KY-Senate|publisher=Sunlight Foundation}}</ref> 

On June 28, 2010, Rand Paul supporters held their first post-primary online fundraising drive, this time promoted as a "money blast."<ref>[http://www.gorandgo.com/ "GoRandGo.com <U+2013> Road to Victory Money Blast"], gorandgo.com/ June 7, 2010</ref><ref>[http://www.whas11.com/news/local/Rand-Paul-supporters-plan-Moneyblast-95745464.html "Rand Paul supporters plan 'Moneyblast'"], June 7, 2010</ref> His campaign got off to a rough start after his comments on [[Civil Rights Act of 1964#Title II|Title II]] of Civil Rights Act of 1964 stirred controversy.<ref name="Thompson">Thompson, Krissah and Dan Balz.

One debate was held between the two candidates, at the [[University of Louisville]]. It was considered a very heated debate, in which both candidates made rude comments, centered around an ad run by Conway stating, "Why was Rand Paul a member of a secret society that called the Holy Bible 'a hoax,' that was banned for mocking Christianity and Christ?" Speaking about the ad, Paul stated, "We have serious problems in our country ... and he has descended into the gutter to attack my personal religious beliefs. ... Jack, you should be ashamed of yourself. You should apologize. Have you no decency? Have you no shame?" <ref>{{cite news|title=Senate debate in Kentucky devolves into a name-calling session|url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/POLITICS/10/17/kentucky.senate.debate/index.html?_s=PM:POLITICS|newspaper=CNN|date=October 17, 2010}}</ref> Beyond the ad, Civil Rights, drugs and social security also were mentioned during the course of the heated debate. <ref>{{cite news|title=Obama, Civil Rights Centerpiece of Kentucky Senate Debate|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/10/11/obama-civil-rights-centerpiece-kentucky-senate-debate/#ixzz2P4OXKH24|newspaper=FOX News|date=October 11, 2010}}</ref>

===Filibuster history===

On March 6<U+2013>7, 2013, Paul engaged in a talking [[Filibuster in the United States Senate|filibuster]] to block voting on the nomination of [[John O. Brennan]] as the [[Director of the Central Intelligence Agency|Director of the CIA]], questioning [[Barack Obama]] and [[Obama administration|his administration's]] use of [[unmanned aerial vehicle|drones]], and the stated legal justification for hypothetical lethal use within the United States. [[File:Rand Paul Filibuster.png|right|thumb|Rand Paul speaking during his filibuster.]]Paul held the floor for 12 hours and 52 minutes<ref>{{cite news|title=Rand Paul Ends Epic Mr. Smith-Style Filibuster After More Than 12 Hours|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2013/03/06/rand_paul_is_waging_an_epic_mr_smith_style_filibuster_right_now.html|author=Josh Voorhees|work=Slate|date=March 7, 2013}}</ref>, at times ceding to several other Republican senators as well as one Democratic senator, [[Ron Wyden]], who joined in questioning the use of drones and related topics.<ref>{{cite news|title=Sen.

He argued that the language administration officials had used when questioned over that potential usage of drones was unclear, and could potentially lead to a slippery slope where citizens could be targeted merely for expressing views different than those of the president. He asked for the [[Obama administration|administration]] to say they will not target noncombatants on U.S. soil.<ref>http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2013/03/07/rand-paul-brennan-filibuster/1969869/</ref> Attorney General [[Eric Holder]] replied later on March 7, stating that the president does not have the authority to use weaponized drones within the U.S. [[Extrajudicial punishment|to kill]], without [[Due Process Clause|due process]], Americans not engaged in combat; he stated that he was "quite happy" with the response.<ref>http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2013/03/07/obama-administration-responds-to-paul-on-drones/</ref> During the filibuster, Paul was able to appeal to many other voters, including some who had not previously supported him or his father, [[Ron Paul]]. He was also able to appeal to voters who had supported his father, but were skeptical towards him.<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2013/03/07/politics/rand-paul-ron-paul/index.html Rand Paul scores points with father's skeptical supporters]</ref> Paul said he was amazed by the support he got from Americans and from fellow senators and even congressman who entered the senate chamber against custom, in order to show their support.

On March 25, 2013, an announcement was made by senators Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, and [[Mike Lee (U.S. politician)|Mike Lee]], threatening that they would hold more filibusters over any pieces of legislation that enforce [[Gun control#Gun control in the United States|gun control]] on the house floor, in the Senate. The [[White House Office|White House]] prompted a warning letter, in response. <ref>{{cite news|last]Allen|first=Jonathan|title=Rand Paul and Ted Cruz threaten filibuster on guns|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2013/03/rand-paul-and-ted-cruz-threaten-filibuster-on-guns-89299.html}}</ref>

===Speculation on future===
[[File:Rand Paul by Gage Skidmore 7.jpg|right|thumb|Rand Paul speaking at the 2013 [[Conservative Political Action Conference]] (CPAC) in National Harbor, Maryland on March 14, 2013.]]
After the 2012 Election, Rand was often in the news speaking on how the Republican Party needs to adapt to the country's changing demographics and beliefs. In a radio interview with [[Aaron Klein]], Paul spoke about a possible 2016 presidency bid. He said he was not promising a run but did say he would make a decision within the next two years. He also mentioned that even if he does not run, he is still planning on re-shaping the way GOP handles certain policies.<ref>http://www.politico.com/story/2013/01/rand-paul-gop-must-evolve-and-adapt-86473.html</ref>

On February 13, 2013, Rand Paul delivered the official "Tea Party" response to President Obama's state of the union speech.  <ref>http://www.politico.com/story/2013/02/tea-party-rebuttal-text-of-rand-paul-response-87557.html</ref>  [[Marco Rubio]] gave the official GOP response which prompted some pundits to call February 13, 2013 the start of the 2016 GOP primaries.<ref>http://www.npr.org/2013/02/14/172034468/rand-paul-big-governments-not-a-friend-to-those-who-are-trying-to-get-ahead</ref>

On March 14, Paul gave a speech at the 2013 [[Conservative Political Action Conference]] in Washington DC.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2013/03/2016-rubio-paul-et-al-court-cpac-crowd-88884.html|title=CPAC 2013: Marco Rubio, Rand Paul fight for the future of the GOP|author=Lois Romano|publisher=Politico|date=March 14, 2013|accessdate=March 14, 2013}}</ref> He also won the 2013 CPAC straw poll on March 16, winning 25% of the votes cast.<ref>http://firstread.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/03/16/17341131-rand-paul-wins-cpac-straw-poll-rubio-close-second?lite</ref>

==Political positions==

Paul supports [[term limit]]s, a [[Balanced Budget Amendment#United States|balanced budget amendment]], and the [[Read the Bills Act]], in addition to the widespread reduction of federal spending and taxation. He has gained prominence for his independent positions on many political issues, often clashing with both [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]].<ref name="schreiner1"/> He received a perfect score from the [[Gun Owners of America]], [[National Right to Life Committee]], and the [[American Conservative Union]]. [[National Journal]] gave him a 100% conservative record in 2011. <ref>{{cite web|title=Senator Rand Paul|url=http://votesmart.org/candidate/117285/rand-paul#.UViCpRybP5I|work=Project VoteSmart|publisher=Votesmart.org|accessdate=March 31, 2013}}</ref> On [[Fox News]], Senator Paul was quoted as saying Congress' political position is "10 years behind the American Public." 
<ref>{{cite news|last=Johnson|first=Eliana|title=Paul: Congress <U+2018>Ten Years Behind the American Public<U+2019>|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/343776/paul-congress-ten-years-behind-american-public-eliana-johnson|newspaper=National Review|date=March 24, 2013}}</ref> 

[[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]] noted that Rand Paul had the "Art of a political salesman," and was able to market his ideas to his audience, adding that his ability to disagree with his party often helps him win in an argument. <ref>{{cite news|last=Altman|first=Alex|title=In Kentucky, Rand Paul Demonstrates the Art of the Sale|url=http://swampland.time.com/2013/03/29/in-kentucky-rand-paul-demonstrates-the-art-of-the-sale/#ixzz2P91ByTQa|accessdate=March 31st, 2013|newspaper=TIME Magazine|date=March 29th, 2013}}</ref> In the hours after his filibuster, CNN noted that Paul "Can shape the future of conservatism."
 
There has been some disagreement over whether or not Paul is a [[Libertarianism|libertarian]].{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} He has stated that he is "not quite" a libertarian, including in a [[USA Today]] column that he wrote. He considers himself to be a [[Tea Party movement|Tea Party]] follower, who wants smaller government, but not quite a libertarian. <ref>{{cite news|last=Paul|first=Rand|title=Rand Paul, libertarian?
