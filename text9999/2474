The '''1939 Pacific typhoon season''' has no official bounds; it ran year-round in [[1939]], but most [[tropical cyclones]] tend to form in the northwestern [[Pacific Ocean]] between [[May]] and [[November]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.typhoon2000.ph/garyp_mgtcs/may03sum.txt | title = GARY PADGETT'S MONTHLY GLOBAL TROPICAL CYCLONE SUMMARY: May 2003 | accessdate = 2007-01-15 | last = Padgett | first = Gary | coauthors = John Wallace, Kevin Boyle, and Simon Clarke | date = 2003-08-17 | work = Typhoon2000.ph | publisher = David Michael V. Padua }}</ref> These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northwestern [[Pacific Ocean]]. 

The scope of this article is limited to the Pacific Ocean, north of the equator and west of the [[international date line]]. Storms that form east of the date line and north of the equator are called hurricanes; see [[1925-1949 Pacific hurricane seasons|1939 Pacific hurricane season]]. Storms in the season were tracked by the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|United States Weather Bureau]] and released in the [[Monthly Weather Review]] under the header '''Typhoons and Depressions over the Far East'''. The Monthly Weather Review only covers [[tropical cyclone]]s west of 150<U+00B0> [[Longitude|E]]. Due to lack of satellites and ship reports due to the [[Pacific War|Pacific theatre]] of [[World War II]], it is possible other tropical cyclones existed, especially if they were short-lived or of minor intensity.

==Storms==
===Depression One===
A depression was first observed on [[February 3]] while located about 250&nbsp;miles (400&nbsp;km) of [[Yap]]. It tracked steadily westward until [[February 7]] when it stalled about 200&nbsp;miles (320&nbsp;km) east of the [[Philippines|Philippine]] island of [[Mindanao]]. The depression remained nearly stationary for two days until turning to a steady northwest motion. It approached the island of [[Samar Island]] on [[February 12]], where a pressure of 1006&nbsp;[[mbar]] was reported, and subsequently turned to the north and later to the northeast. The depression was last observed on [[February 16]] accelerating towards the [[Aleutian Islands]]. The system produced heavy rainfall in the Philippines, with extensive flooding reported in [[Surigao del Norte]]. It is unknown if the system intensified into a tropical storm.<ref name="feb">{{cite web|author=Bernard F. Doucette|year=1939|title=Typhoons and depressions over the Far East: February 1939|publisher=United States Weather Bureau|accessdate=2007-01-06|url=http://docs.lib.noaa.gov/rescue/mwr/067/mwr-067-02-0054.pdf}}</ref>

===Typhoon Two===
On [[April 29]], an [[low pressure area|area of low pressure]] was located about 300&nbsp;miles (480&nbsp;km) south of [[Yap]]. It moved westward, northward, and ultimately to the west-northwest before developing into a tropical depression on [[May 2]] to the east of the [[Philippines]]. Early on [[May 3]], after intensifying into a tropical storm the system struck the Philippine island of [[Samar Island]], and the next day it hit [[Masbate]] before turning northward. After passing over northern [[Luzon]] on [[May 5]], the storm accelerated northeastward as it moved through the [[Luzon Strait]], and intensified into a typhoon on [[May 7]]. While the typhoon was off the southern coast of [[Japan]], a ship located 290&nbsp;miles (465&nbsp;km) south of [[Nagoya]] reported a minimum central pressure of 986&nbsp;[[mbar]] (hPa). The typhoon weakened as it paralleled about 100&nbsp;miles (160&nbsp;km) off of the coast of [[Japan]], and was last observed on [[May 9]] accelerating northeastward.<ref name="april">{{Cite web|author=Bernard F. Doucette|year=1939|title=Typhoons and depressions over the Far East: April 1939|publisher=United States Weather Bureau|accessdate=2007-01-06|url=http://docs.lib.noaa.gov/rescue/mwr/067/mwr-067-05-0153.pdf}}</ref>

The storm produced strong winds throughout the eastern portions of the Philippine archipelago. 90 fishermen were caught in the storm, with one person drowned and eleven missing at one estimate one month after the storm passed the area. Winds reached tropical storm force in southern Japan.<ref name="april"/>

===Typhoon Three===
A tropical depression developed on [[May 26]] in the northern portion of the [[South China Sea]]. After initially moving to the northwest, the depression later turned to the northeast and quickly intensified to attain typhoon status by [[May 28]] while located to the east of [[Hainan Island]]. The typhoon stalled stalled on [[May 30]] before turning to the west, and moved inland on southern [[China]] on [[May 31]]. Several ships reported strong winds, rough seas, and heavy rainfall in conjunction with the storm, with one ship reporting a minimum central pressure of 994&nbsp;[[mbar]] (hPa). On land, a station in [[Hong Kong]] recorded a pressure of about 1000&nbsp;mbar as well as minor winds. No damage was reported.<ref name="may">{{cite web|author=Bernard F.

===Typhoon Four===
On [[July 7]], a tropical depression was first observed while located about 400&nbsp;miles (645&nbsp;km) east of [[Naha, Okinawa]]. It moved to the northwest, and the next day a station in [[Amami <U+014C>shima|<U+014C>shima]] reported winds in excess of 65&nbsp;mph (105&nbsp;km/h) and a pressure of 978&nbsp;[[mbar]] (hPa) when the storm was nearby. Based on the report, it is estimated it intensified into a typhoon, and after turning northeastward upon entering the [[Yellow Sea]] it struck [[North Korea]]. The storm turned to the east, and was last observed on [[July 12]] in the open [[Pacific Ocean]]. Rainfall and flooding from the typhoon and several other storms during the month resulted in two deaths and considerable damage to private and public property in the Philippines.<ref name="july">{{cite web|author=Bernard F. Doucette|year=1939|title=Additional Report on Typhoons and Depressions over the Far East: July 1939|publisher=United States Weather Bureau|accessdate=2007-01-06|url=http://docs.lib.noaa.gov/rescue/mwr/067/mwr-067-07-0227.pdf}}</ref>

===Typhoon Five===
A tropical depression developed roughly 250&nbsp;miles (400&nbsp;km) of the eastern [[Philippines]] on [[July 7]]. The depression tracked northwestward initially, and after intensifying into a typhoon its motion turned to the north-northeast, followed by a turn back to the northwest on [[July 10]]. The typhoon crossed the [[East China Sea]] and made [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] on eastern [[China]] near [[Shanghai]] on [[July 12]], where 80 mph winds and a pressure of 992&nbsp;[[mbar]] (hPa) were recorded. The storm weakened as it continued its motion while roughly paralleling the northern coastline, and dissipated on [[July 13]]. The passage of the typhoon killed at least six people in Shanghai.<ref name="july"/>

===Typhoon Six===
A typhoon quickly developed about 120&nbsp;miles (195&nbsp;km) west of northern [[Luzon]] on [[July 10]]. It initially moved northwestward, then a day later turned to the northeast. After passing through the [[Luzon Strait]], the typhoon changed its motion to the northwest, resulting in a landfall on northern [[Taiwan]]. The typhoon struck southeastern [[China]], and dissipated about 500&nbsp;miles (800&nbsp;km) inland on [[July 17]]. A ship en route to [[Hong Kong]] reported a pressure of 997&nbsp;[[mbar]] (hPa) and winds of over 40&nbsp;mph (65&nbsp;km/h). A station on western Luzon recorded minor winds and slightly below normal pressures in association with the system, though damage, if any, is unknown.<ref name="july"/>

===Typhoon Seven===
On [[July 15]], a [[low pressure area]] formed into a tropical depression while located about halfway between the [[Philippines]] and the [[Marianas Islands]]. The depression steadily intensified as it tracked to the northwest, and attained typhoon status on [[July 18]]. After a brief turn to the north-northeast, the storm changed its motion to the northwest, and made landfall on southeastern [[Taiwan]] and later on [[China]] on [[July 20]] about 120&nbsp;miles (195&nbsp;km) south of [[Shanghai]]. It quickly dissipated. A station in the [[Ryukyu Islands]] reported a pressure of 997&nbsp;[[mbar]] (hPa) with light winds. Damage, if any, is unknown.<ref name="july"/>

===Typhoon Eight===
A tropical depression formed on [[July 20]] while located between the [[Philippines]] and the [[Marianas Islands]]. After moving steadily northwestward, the system stalled for two days, and later turned to the north-northeast. The storm intensified into a typhoon shortly before crossing the [[Ryukyu Islands]], after which it turned sharply westward. Unfavorable conditions encountered the storm, and it rapidly dissipated over the open waters of the [[East China Sea]] on [[July 27]]. A station in [[Naha, Okinawa]] recorded a pressure of 999&nbsp;[[mbar]], with another station in the Ryukyu Islands reporting winds of around 20&nbsp;mph (32&nbsp;km/h). There was no reported damage.<ref name="july"/>

===Typhoon Nine===
A well-developed typhoon was first observed on [[July 22]] moving rapidly northward about 700&nbsp;miles (1125&nbsp;km) east of [[Taiwan]]. The typhoon turned to the northwest, passing just south of the [[Japan|Japanese]] island of [[Ky<U+016B>sh<U+016B>]]. It turned to the west, crossing the [[Yellow Sea]] and striking the [[China|Chinese]] province of [[Shandong]] before dissipating on [[July 25]]. A station in the [[Ryukyu Islands]] recorded a pressure of 997&nbsp;[[mbar]] (hPa), with a station on [[Borodino Island]] reporting winds of about 15&nbsp;mph (24&nbsp;km/h). Damage, if any, is unknown.<ref name="july"/>

===Typhoon Ten===
On [[July 22]] a small typhoon developed a short distance off the coast of [[Taiwan]]. It drifted northwestward, then turned to the northeast, and by [[July 24]] unfavorable conditions caused it to dissipate. A ship sailing between [[Hong Kong]] and [[Shanghai]], [[China]] reported a pressure of 995&nbsp;[[mbar]] and winds of around 35&nbsp;mph (55&nbsp;km/h). No reports are available from Taiwan, and damage, if any, is unknown.<ref name="july"/>

===Typhoon Eleven===
An [[low-pressure area|area of low pressure]] organized into a tropical depression on [[July 25]] over the open waters of the western [[Pacific Ocean]]. The depression tracked northwestward, and gradually strengthened to attain typhoon status on [[July 27]]. After turning to the west, it gradually recurved towards the north and approached northern [[Taiwan]]. Under varying steering currents, the typhoon executed a counterclockwise loop over the country, and exited from the southern coastline after turning eastward. By the morning of [[August 1]], it was located about 250&nbsp;miles (400&nbsp;km) east of Taiwan, after which the typhoon accelerated to the northeast. After reaching the [[Ryukyu Islands]] on [[August 3]], the storm stalled, turned to the northwest for a day, then weakened until dissipating on [[August 6]] to the south of [[Japan]] after turning to the east. A station in the [[Philippines]] reported a pressure of 996&nbsp;[[mbar]] (hPa) in association with the storm, with another station recording winds of 68&nbsp;mph (110&nbsp;km/h). Damage, if any, is unknown.<ref name="july"/>

===Typhoon Twelve===
On [[July 28]], a low pressure area formed into a tropical depression over the [[Marianas Islands]]. It tracked to the northwest, and quickly intensified into a typhoon a few hours after developing while located about 250&nbsp;miles (400&nbsp;km) south of the [[Ogasawara Islands]]. After changing its motion to the west, the typhoon turned sharply northward on [[July 31]], followed by a turn to the east-northeast. The storm passed through the Ogasawara Islands on [[August 2]], and halted its forward motion before turning to the northwest. On [[August 6]] the typhoon struck south-central [[Japan]] and later the island of [[Hokkaid<U+014D>]] after turning to the northeast, and it was last observed on [[August 8]] in the open western [[Pacific Ocean]]. A ship passing through the center of the typhoon recorded a pressure of 960&nbsp;[[mbar]] (hPa) and winds exceeding 55&nbsp;mph (88&nbsp;km/h). Damage from the typhoon, if any, is unknown.<ref name="july"/>

===Depression Thirteen===
[[Image:USS Pigeon (ARS-6).jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[USS Pigeon (ARS-6)|USS Pigeon]] grounded on China from September typhoon]]
A tropical depression formed on [[September 12]] about 300&nbsp;miles (480&nbsp;km) south of [[Guam]]. It moved northwestward without strengthening, and dissipated on [[September 16]] about 600&nbsp;miles (965&nbsp;km) east of the [[Philippines]]. The depression never affected land.<ref name="sept">{{cite web|author=Bernard F. Doucette|year=1939|title=Typhoons and Depressions over the Far East: September 1939|publisher=United States Weather Bureau|accessdate=2007-01-07|url=http://docs.lib.noaa.gov/rescue/mwr/067/mwr-067-09-0358.pdf}}</ref>

===Typhoon Fourteen===
On [[September 17]] a tropical depression developed in the [[South China Sea]]. It tracked westward, and intensified into a typhoon. On [[September 19]], the storm made landfall on [[Vietnam]] about 150&nbsp;miles (240&nbsp;km) northwest of [[Da Nang]], and subsequently dissipated. Meteorological details for the typhoon are unavailable due to the presence of the [[Pacific War|Pacific Theatre]] of [[World War II]].<ref name="sept"/>

===Typhoon Fifteen===
An area of disturbed weather organized into a tropical depression on [[September 18]] about 250&nbsp;miles (400&nbsp;km) west of [[Guam]]. The depression slowly intensified as it moved generally northwestward, and by [[September 21]] it attained typhoon status while located about east of [[Aparri, Cagayan|Aparri]] on the [[Philippines|Philippine]] island of [[Luzon]]. Shortly after strengthening into a typhoon, the storm turned to the northeast and paralleled the southern coastline of [[Japan]] a short distance offshore. It was last observed on [[September 24]]. Effects, if any, are unnknown.<ref name="sept"/>

===Typhoon Sixteen===
Atmospheric pressure was relatively low over the [[South China Sea]] during the last week of September, and subsequent to the development of a circulation in an area of disturbed weather, a tropical depression formed on [[September 27]]. It quickly strenghened to typhoon status, and made landfall on eastern [[Vietnam]] just south of [[Da Nang]] on [[September 30]]. The storm quickly weakened over land, with only slight traces of the former typhoon by the following day. A station in the northern [[Philippines]] recorded a pressure of 1000&nbsp;[[mbar]] (hPa), and a recording station near the location of its final landfall reported winds of about 50&nbsp;mph (80&nbsp;km/h). Damage is unknown.<ref name="sept"/>

===Typhoon Seventeen===
On [[October 3]] a tropical depression developed about 500&nbsp;miles (800&nbsp;km) south-southeast of [[Guam]], likely having originated from a tropical disturbance in the eastern [[Caroline Islands]]. The system gradually strengthened to typhoon status while it tracked west-northwestward. On [[October 7]] the typhoon turned to the northwest and moved through the southern [[Luzon Strait]], passing about 30&nbsp;miles (48&nbsp;km) southwest of [[Basco, Batanes|Basco]] in the [[Philippines|Filipino]] province of [[Batanes]] on [[October 9]]. Under unfavorable conditions the typhoon steadily weakened over the subsequent days, and dissipated on [[October 12]] over the southern portion of the [[Taiwan Strait]]. The minimum pressure associated with the typhoon was a value of 957&nbsp;[[mbar]] (hPa) at Basco, where winds exceeding 75&nbsp;mph (120&nbsp;km/h) were also recorded. Reportedly damage was minor over northern [[Luzon]], and no deaths occurred.<ref name="oct">{{cite web|author=Bernard F. Doucette|year=1939|title=Typhoons and Depressions over the Far East: October 1939|publisher=United States Weather Bureau|accessdate=2007-01-08|url=http://docs.lib.noaa.gov/rescue/mwr/067/mwr-067-10-0406b.pdf}}</ref>

===Typhoon Eighteen===
A tropical depression was first observed on [[October 7]] to the east-northeast of [[Guam]]. Tracking to the northwest, the depression steadily intensified to attain typhoon status. Several days later, it began to weaken while gradually recurving to the northeast, and on [[October 13]] it became extratropical. A ship on its way to the [[Philippines]] recorded a pressure of 995&nbsp;[[mbar]] (hPa) along with winds of about 50&nbsp;mph (80&nbsp;km/h).<ref name="oct"/>

===Typhoon Nineteen===
On [[October 10]] a tropical depression was first observed about 300&nbsp;miles (480&nbsp;km) south of [[Guam]]. It initially moved west-northwestward, and strengthened into a typhoon on [[October 11]] while briefly changing its motion to the southwest. The next day the typhoon turned to the northwest, and days later turned to the north while located about 150&nbsp;miles (240&nbsp;km) east of [[Batan Province]] in the [[Philippines]]. After passing through the [[Ryukyu Islands]], it weakened as it turned to the northeast and east, and on [[October 17]] it was last observed turning to the southeast over the open [[Pacific Ocean]]. A ship en route to [[Hong Kong]] on [[October 15]] recorded a pressure of 968&nbsp;[[mbar]] (hPa) and winds of over 75&nbsp;mph (120&nbsp;km/h) while located to the east of [[Taiwan]]. The passage of the typhoon caused 33&nbsp;fatalities in [[Japan]].<ref name="oct"/>

===Typhoon Twenty===
A [[low pressure area]] developed into a tropical depression on [[October 21]] about 300&nbsp;miles (480&nbsp;km) northwest of [[Guam]]. After initially moving northwestward, it turned to the north and intensified into a typhoon on [[October 22]]. On [[October 23]] it passed near or over the [[Ogasawara Islands]], where a recording station reported a pressure of 996&nbsp;[[mbar]]. The typhoon was last observed on [[October 23]] accelerating northeastward.<ref name="oct"/>

===Tropical Storm Twenty-One===
On [[November 4]] a tropical disturbance organized into a tropical depression while located about 300&nbsp;miles (480&nbsp;km) east of [[Mindanao]]. It moved quickly to the west-northwest, and struck the [[Philippines|Philippine]] island of [[Samar]] without strengthening further. After passing through the archipelago, the storm entered the [[South China Sea]] late on [[November 5]], and gradually weakened until dissipation on [[November 9]] near southwestern [[Taiwan]]. A station in [[Santa Cruz, Laguna|Santa Cruz]] in [[Laguna (province)|Laguna province]] recorded a pressure of 997&nbsp;[[mbar]] (hPa), with at least one station in the Philippines reporting tropical storm force winds. Reports from the country indicate it was potentially a typhoon, though meteorologists decided it was not due to relatively high pressures and lack of significant convection to the southwest of the center. Damage, if any, is unknown.<ref name="nov">{{cite web|author=Bernard F. Doucette|year=1939|title=Typhoons and Depressions over the Far East: November 1939|publisher=United States Weather Bureau|accessdate=2007-01-08|url=http://docs.lib.noaa.gov/rescue/mwr/067/mwr-067-11-0432b.pdf}}</ref>

===Depression Twenty-Two===
A tropical depression formed on [[November 6]] about 500&nbsp;miles (800&nbsp;km) east of [[Mindanao]]. It initially moved to the west-northwest, and gradually recurved to the northeast. After accelerating east-northeastward, the depression was last observed on [[November 13]] as a remnant low pressure area over the open western [[Pacific Ocean]]. It is unknown if it strengthened into a tropical storm.<ref name="nov"/>

===Typhoon Twenty-Three===
On [[November 18]] a tropical depression was first observed to the east of [[Mindanao]]. The depression steadily intensified as it tracked west-northwestward, and intensified into a typhoon prior to striking [[Samar Island]] and [[Leyte Island]] on [[November 19]]. It continued westward until reaching the western region of the [[South China Sea]] on [[November 22]].<ref name="nov"/> An approaching [[surface weather analysis|cold front]] turned the typhoon to the northeast, resulting in a rare occurrence of a typhoon recurving northeastward in the western portion of the South China Sea. On [[November 24]] the typhoon passed over [[Macau]], and two hours later the [[eye (cyclone)|eye]] crossed directly over [[Hong Kong]]. The calm of the center of the eye lasted for fifteen minutes at the [[Hong Kong Observatory]], the first time on record that the calm of the typhoon was recorded there. The typhoon began to become [[extratropical]] after making landfall,<ref name="hko">{{cite web|author=G.S.P. Heywood|year=1940|title=The Typhoon of November 23, 1939|publisher=The Hong Kong Naturalist|accessdate=2007-01-09|url=http://sunzi1.lib.hku.hk/hkjo/view/27/2700497.pdf}}</ref> and continued northeastward through southern [[China]]. It gradually weakened while passing through the [[Taiwan Strait]] and possibly over [[Taiwan]] before dissipating on [[November 26]].<ref name="nov"/>

While crossing over the [[Philippines]], a station in [[Capiz]] on [[Panay Island]] recorded a pressure of 981&nbsp;[[mbar]] (hPa) as well as winds in excess of 55&nbsp;mph (88&nbsp;km/h). The passage of the typhoon sunk a motor boat on [[Masbate]] island, killing 48 of the 50 occupants aboard. One person was reported missing and presumed dead in [[Balangiga, Eastern Samar|Balangiga]] in [[Eastern Samar]], believed to be caused by drowning. Property damage was great in [[Samar province|Samar]], [[Leyte province|Leyte]], and [[Capiz province]]s.<ref name="nov"/> In [[Hong Kong]], wind gusts reached 74&nbsp;mph (119&nbsp;km/h) during a [[rainband]] ahead of the storm. Rainfall began seven hours prior to the arrival of the typhoon, and amounted to roughly 4.27&nbsp;inches (108&nbsp;mm). The heaviest rainfall occurred in rainbands ahead of the typhoon, with about 1.6&nbsp;inches (40&nbsp;mm) falling during a 1&nbsp;hour time period. The lowest pressure recorded in Hong Kong was about 989&nbsp;[[mbar]] (hPa) while the typhoon was passing through the area. Damage was minor in Hong Kong.<ref name="hko"/>

===Tropical Depression Twenty-Four===
On [[November 22]] a tropical depression formed to the east of [[Mindanao]], and subsequently tracked to the northwest. Days later it stalled while located about 250&nbsp;miles (400&nbsp;km) east of [[Samar Island]], and gradually weakened. Cold air intruded the circulation on [[November 25]], and two days later it became [[extratropical cyclone|extratropical]].<ref name="nov"/>

===Typhoon Twenty-Five===
A well-developed typhoon was first observed on [[November 29]] while located about 150&nbsp;miles (240&nbsp;km) south of [[Yap]]. It moved to the northwest, and struck [[Samar Island]] on [[December 2]]. The typhoon continued northwestward through the archipelago, and gradually  weakened while drifting through the [[South China Sea]]. It turned to the northeast, and dissipated on [[December 5]] off of the coast of northern [[Luzon]]. The typhoon produced heavy rainfall and strong winds along its path through the [[Philippines]]. Rivers throughout [[Masbate]] island were overflown from the abundant rainfall, causing 34&nbsp;fatalities on the island. A station on Samar Island recorded a barometric minimum of 975&nbsp;[[mbar]] (hPa).<ref name="dec">{{cite web|author=Bernard F. Doucette|year=1940|title=Typhoons and Depressions over the Far East: December 1939|publisher=United States Weather Bureau|accessdate=2007-01-08|url=http://docs.lib.noaa.gov/rescue/mwr/068/mwr-068-01-0030b.pdf}}</ref>

===Typhoon Twenty-Six===
An area of disturbed weather organized into a tropical depression on [[December 5]] about 200&nbsp;miles (320&nbsp;km) southwest of [[Guam]]. After moving west-northwestward for several days, it turned to the northeast on [[December 9]], during which it attained typhoon status. The typhoon maintained peak winds for about two days before quickly weakening to a remnant area of low pressure on [[December 11]]. A ship in the vicinity of the cyclone reported a minimum pressure of 952&nbsp;[[mbar]].<ref name="dec"/>

===Typhoon Twenty-Seven===
On [[December 16]], a [[low pressure area]] quickly organized into a typhoon about 350&nbsp;miles (565&nbsp;km) east of [[Surigao del Norte|Surigao]]. It moved quickly to the northwest at speeds of about 30&nbsp;mph (48&nbsp;km/h), faster than all but one previously known typhoon. The storm struck southeastern [[Luzon]] and turned to the north and north-northeast. After passing near [[Manila]] it reached open waters on [[December 20]]. For the following two days, it drifted eastward, possibly executing a loop, and after accelerating to the northeast it was last observed on [[December 24]]. A station at [[Sorsogon]] recorded a pressure of 998 [[mbar]]. While passing through the northern [[Philippines]], the typhoon produced heavy rainfall, killing 19 on [[Masbate]] and 14 in northern Luzon.<ref name="dec"/>

===Typhoon Twenty-Eight===
The final typhoon of the season was first observed on [[December 22]] about 225&nbsp;miles (360&nbsp;km) south of [[Guam]]. It initially moved to the northwest, and on [[December 24]] the typhoon turned to the east-northeast. It steadily weakened, and was last observed on [[December 26]] accelerating out to sea. The typhoon produced heavy rainfall and winds of around 50&nbsp;mph (80&nbsp;km/h) on Guam. The minimum pressure associated with the typhoon was a ship report of 995&nbsp;[[mbar]] (hPa).<ref name="dec"/>
