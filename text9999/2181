'''Bury St Edmunds [[railway station]]''' serves the town of [[Bury St Edmunds]] in [[Suffolk]], [[England]]. The station, and all trains calling there, are operated by [['one']].

==Architecture and layout==
Designed by [[Sancton Wood]] (the architect also of [[Ipswich railway station|Ipswich]] and [[Cambridge railway station|Cambridge]] railway stations as well as many stations in [[Ireland]], the principal of which is [[Heuston Station]], [[Dublin]]), the station was formally inaugurated in November 1847, eleven months after the opening of the [[Eastern Union Railway]]'s line from [[Ipswich]]. 

The most noteworthy feature of the station, which is constructed of red brick with stone dressings, is a pair of towers (originally linked by an overall roof, removed in 1893) on either side of the tracks at the eastern end of the layout. As first built &ndash; as a terminus &ndash; the station had four tracks, although in practice only one platform was used before the line was extended to [[Newmarket]] in 1854. Today a wide space separates the two surviving through tracks, which serve Platform 1 (for trains from Ipswich) and Platform 2 (called at by those heading east).<ref>{{cite book|author=Biddle, Gordon|title=Britain's Historic Railway Buildings|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2003|isbn=0-19-866247-5}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk|journal=Great Eastern Journal|issue=106|pages=23<U+2013>9|date=2001 April}}</ref>

The semi-elliptical brick arch bridge over Northgate Road to the east of the station, which like the station building is a Grade II [[listed building]], has been credited to [[Frederick Barnes]] and Charles Russell.

==Derailment==
Due to the freight train derailment on a bridge near Ely, trains to Peterborough from London terminate at Bury St Edmunds with a replacement bus service in operation
