The '''Russian [[Ironclad warship|ironclad]] ''Petropavlovsk''''' ({{lang-ru|<U+041F><U+0435><U+0442><U+0440><U+043E><U+043F><U+0430><U+0432><U+043B><U+043E><U+0432><U+0441><U+043A>}}) was ordered as a 58-gun wooden [[frigate]] by the [[Imperial Russian Navy]] in the early 1860s, but was converted while under construction into an 22-gun [[armored frigate]]. She served as the [[flagship]] of the [[Baltic Fleet]] during the 1860s and 1870s. The ship was [[Ship decommissioning|decommissioned]] in 1885, but was not sold for [[ship breaking|scrap]] until 1892.

==Description==
''Petropavlovsk'' was {{convert|300|ft|m|1}} long [[length between perpendiculars|between perpendiculars]], with a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert |50|ft|4|in|m|1}} and a [[Draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|22|ft|2|in|m|1}} (forward) and {{convert|24|ft|m|1}} (aft). She displaced {{convert|6040|LT|t}} and was fitted with a blunt iron [[naval ram|ram]] at her [[bow (ship)|bow]].<ref name=m7>Gardiner, p. 173</ref> ''Petropavlovsk'' was considered to be [[seaworthy]]; her total crew numbered 680 officers and enlisted men.<ref name=r5>''Russian Ironclad Frigates Sevastopol and Petropavlovsk'', p. 415</ref>

The ship was fitted with a [[Marine steam engine#Back acting|horizontal return-connecting-rod steam engine]]<ref name=m7/> built by the [[Charles Baird (engineer)|Baird Works]] of [[Saint Petersburg]].<ref name=ts4/> It drove a single four-bladed propeller using steam that was provided by an unknown number of rectangular [[boiler (steam generator)|boiler]]s.<ref name=m7/> During the ship's [[sea trial]]s, the engine produced a total of {{convert|2805|ihp|lk=in}} and gave the ship a maximum speed of {{convert|11.8|kn|lk=in}}. The ship carried a maximum of {{convert|375|LT|t}} of coal, but her endurance is unknown.<ref name=ts4>Tredea & Sozea, p. 414</ref> She was [[ship rig|ship rigged]] with three [[mast (sailing)|mast]]s.<ref name=m7/>

As a heavy frigate, ''Petropavlovsk'' was intended to be armed with 54 of the most powerful guns available to the Russians, the {{convert|7.72|in|adj=on|0}} 60-pounder [[smoothbore]] gun, and four long 36-pounder smoothbores. Her armament was revised when she was converted to an [[ironclad]] and she was completed with an armament of twenty {{convert|8|in|0|adj=on}} [[Rifling|rifled]] guns and two 60-pounder guns; all of the 8-inch guns were located on the lower deck and the 60-pounders were mounted on the upper deck as [[chase gun]]s. Later another pair of 60-pounder guns were added on the upper deck. In 1877, the armament on her upper deck was changed and consisted of one 8-inch, one {{convert|6|in|0|adj=on}} and ten {{convert|3.4|in|0|adj=on}} rifled guns.<ref name=ts4/>

The entire ship's side was protected with wrought-iron armor<ref name=r5/> that extended {{convert|5|ft|2|in|m|1}} below the [[waterline]].<ref>Watts, p. 67</ref> It was {{convert|4.5|in|0}} thick amidships, backed by {{convert|10|in|0}} of [[teak]], that reduced to {{convert|3|in|0}}, backed by six inches of teak, in steps beginning {{convert|50|ft|m|1}} from the ship's ends.<ref name=r5/>

==Construction and service==
''Petropavlovsk'', named for the [[Siege of Petropavlovsk]] during the [[Crimean War]],<ref>Silverstone, p. 381</ref> was [[Keel|laid down]] on 12 January 1861 as a 58-gun heavy frigate at the [[Admiralty Shipyard|New Admiralty Shipyard]] in Saint Petersburg. She was reordered as (converted into) a 22-gun armored frigate on 29 October 1861 while still under construction. The ship was [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 15 August 1865 and [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 1 August 1867. During the 1860s and 1870s, ''Petropavlovsk'' served as the flagship of the Baltic Fleet.<ref name=ts4/> She was decommissioned on 15 June 1885, stricken from the Navy List on 4 January 1892 and subsequently sold for scrap.<ref name=ts4/>
