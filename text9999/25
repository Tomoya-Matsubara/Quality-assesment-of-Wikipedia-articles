'''Martha Christina Tiahahu''' (4 January 1800&nbsp;<U+2013> 2 January 1818) was a [[Maluku|Moluccan]] freedom fighter and [[List of National Heroes of Indonesia|National Heroine of Indonesia]].

Born to a military captain, Tiahahu was active in military matters from a young age. She joined the war led by [[Pattimura]] against the [[Dutch East Indies|Dutch colonial government]] when she was 17, fighting in several battles. After being captured in October 1817, she was released on account of her age. She continued to fight, and was captured again. Sent to [[Java]] to be a slave labourer, she fell ill on the way and, refusing to eat or take medicine, died over the [[Banda Sea]].

Tiahahu is considered a National Heroine of Indonesia, with the date of her death celebrated as a holiday. She has also been honoured with two statues, one in [[Ambon, Maluku|Ambon]] and one in Abubu; other namesakes include a warship, street, Moluccan social organization, and women's magazine.

==Biography==
Tiahahu was born in Abubu village on Nusalaut Island, near Maluku, on 4 January 1800.{{sfn|Azizah|2011|p=121}} Her father was Captain Paulus Tiahahu of the Soa Uluputi clan.{{sfn|Azizah|2011|p=121}}{{sfn|Alaidrus 2010, Martha Christina Si Pemberani}} After her mother died while she was an infant, Tiahahu was raised by her father.{{sfn|Alaidrus 2010, Martha Christina Si Pemberani}} As a child, she was stubborn and followed her father wherever he went, at times joining him in planning attacks.{{sfn|Alaidrus 2010, Martha Christina Si Pemberani}}

Beginning in 1817 Tiahahu joined her father in a guerrilla war against the [[Dutch East Indies|Dutch colonial government]].{{sfn|Tunny 2008, Martha Christina Tiahahu}} They also backed [[Pattimura]]'s army.{{sfn|Azizah|2011|p=121}} She saw several battles. In a battle at [[Saparua|Saparua Island]], the troops killed Dutch commander Richement and wounded his replacement Commander Meyer.{{sfn|Tunny 2008, Martha Christina Tiahahu}} In another battle, she and her troops succeeded in burning Duurstede Fortress to the ground.{{sfn|Alaidrus 2010, Martha Christina Si Pemberani}} During battles, she was said to throw stones at the Dutch troops if her soldiers were out of ammunition, while other accounts have her wielding a spear.{{sfn|Tunny 2008, Martha Christina Tiahahu}}{{sfn|Alaidrus 2010, Martha Christina Si Pemberani}} After Vermeulen Kringer took over the Dutch military in Maluku, Tiahahu, her father, and Pattimura were captured in October 1817.{{sfn|Tunny 2008, Martha Christina Tiahahu}}

Carried on the HNLMS ''Evertsen'' to Nusalaut, Tiahahu was the only captured soldier not punished; this was due to her young age.{{sfn|Tunny 2008, Martha Christina Tiahahu}} After a period of time in holding in Fort Beverwijk, where her father was executed, in late 1817 Tiahahu was released.{{sfn|Tunny 2008, Martha Christina Tiahahu}} She continued to fight against the Dutch.{{sfn|Alaidrus 2010, Martha Christina Si Pemberani}}

In a sweep in December 1817 Tiahahu and several other former rebels were caught.{{sfn|Tunny 2008, Martha Christina Tiahahu}} The captured guerrillas were placed on the ''Evertsen'' to be transported to [[Java]]; they were meant to be used as slave labour on the coffee plantations there.{{sfn|Tunny 2008, Martha Christina Tiahahu}} However, on the way Tiahahu fell ill.{{sfn|Tunny 2008, Martha Christina Tiahahu}} Refusing medication and food, she died on 2 January 1818 while the ship was over the [[Banda Sea]]; she received a [[burial at sea]] later that day.{{sfn|Tunny 2008, Martha Christina Tiahahu}}{{sfn|Alaidrus 2010, Martha Christina Si Pemberani}}

Soon after [[Proclamation of Indonesian Independence|Indonesia's independence]], Tiahahu was declared a [[List of National Heroes of Indonesia|National Heroine of Indonesia]];{{sfn|Tunny 2008, Martha Christina Tiahahu}} 2 January was designated Martha Christina Tiahahu Day.{{sfn|Tunny 2008, Martha Christina Tiahahu}} On that day, people in Maluku spread flower petals over the Banda Sea in an official ceremony honouring her struggle.{{sfn|Tunny 2008, Martha Christina Tiahahu}} However, the ceremony is smaller than that honouring Pattimura, on 15 May.{{sfn|Tunny 2008, Martha Christina Tiahahu}}

Several monuments have been dedicated to Tiahahu. In [[Ambon, Maluku|Ambon]], capital of the [[Maluku (province)|province of Maluku]], an {{convert|8|m|ft|adj=on}} tall statue of her holding a spear was erected in 1977; it stands in Karangpanjang overlooking the Banda Sea.{{sfn|Tunny 2008, Martha Christina Tiahahu}} In Abubu, a statue of her leading soldiers while holding a spear was erected and dedicated on the 190th anniversary of her death.{{sfn|Alaidrus 2010, Martha Christina Si Pemberani}}{{sfn|Tunny 2008, Martha Christina Tiahahu}} She also has several items named after her, including a street in Karangpanjang, Ambon, and a warship, the KRI ''Martha Christina Tiahahu''.{{sfn|Tunny 2008, Martha Christina Tiahahu}}

Other organizations have also taken Tiahahu's name as a symbol of bravery and "spirit of struggle", including a social organization for Moluccans in [[Jakarta]] and a women's magazine in Ambon.{{sfn|Tunny 2008, Martha Christina Tiahahu}}
