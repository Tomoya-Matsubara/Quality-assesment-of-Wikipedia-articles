'''Wood ash''' is the residue [[powder]] left after the [[combustion]] of [[wood]]. Main producers of wood ash are wood industries and power plants.
==Composition==
Typically 6-10 percent of burned wood results in ash.<ref>[http://hubcap.clemson.edu/~blpprt/bestwoodash.html Clemson University: Soil Acidity and Liming], accessed October 1, 2008</ref> The composition of wood ash is influenced by the type of wood that has been burned. Also the conditions of the combustion affect the composition and amount of the residue ash, thus higher temperature will reduce ash yield.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=5621349 |title=Physical and chenical characteristics of wood ask |author=L.

Wood ash contains [[calcium carbonate]] as its major component, representing 25 <ref name=purdue/> or even 45 percent.<ref>[http://www.humeseeds.com/ashes.htm] Ed Hume Seeds: Wood Ashes - How to use them in the Garden</ref> Less than 10 percent is [[potash]], and less than 1 percent [[phosphate]]; there are trace elements of iron, manganese, zinc, copper and some heavy metals.<ref name=purdue>{{cite web |url=http://www.hort.purdue.edu/ext/woodash.html |author=Purdue University

==Uses==
Wood ash is commonly disposed of in [[landfill]]s, but with rising disposal costs ecologically friendly alternatives are becoming more attractive.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6V24-423H71H-9&_user=10&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&view=c&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=97c228ba2e27fdea6d3b3a01f0c20cda |author=Demeyer A, Voundi Nkana JC, Verloo MG| title=Characteristics of wood ash and influence on soil properties and nutrient uptake: an overview}}</ref>

For a long time wood ash has been used in agricultural soil applications as it recycles nutrients back to the land. Wood ash has some value as a [[fertilizer]], but does not contain [[nitrogen]]. Because of the presence of calcium carbonate it acts as a [[liming (soil)|liming]] agent and will deacidify the soil increasing its [[pH]].<ref name=purdue/>. [[Potassium hydroxide]] can be made from wood ash<ref>[http://journeytoforever.org/biodiesel_ashlye.html Making lye from wood ash], accessed October 1, 2008</ref>, this in turn can be used to make [[soap#Lye|soap]].
