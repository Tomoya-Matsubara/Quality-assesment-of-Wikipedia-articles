==Second marriage==

On 16 September 1382, Agnes married her second husband [[James of Baux]]. He was the claimant to the throne of the Latin Empire since 1374.

Their marriage was short-lived. On 7 July 1383, James died in [[Taranto]]. She survived him by five years but never remarried. He was succeeded as Prince of Taranto by [[Otto, Duke of Brunswick-Grubenhagen]], widower of [[Joan I of Naples]]. He was succeeded as Prince of Achaea by [[Charles III of Naples]]. The will of James actually named [[Louis I of Naples|Louis I, Duke of Anjou]], a claimant to the throne of the [[Kingdom of Naples]], as his successor in both the Latin Empire and Achaea.<ref name="Mihail-Dimitri Sturdza 1983 p. 505"/> However Louis and his descendants never used the title. Marie of Blois, wife of Louis I, only used the title of Queen consort of Sicily (Naples).<ref>
