In [[Norse mythology]], '''Valhalla''' (from [[Old Norse]] '''''Valh<U+00F6>ll''''' "hall of the slain"<ref name=ORCHARD171-172>Orchard (1997:171<U+2013>172).</ref>) is a majestic, enormous hall located in [[Asgard]], ruled over by the god [[Odin]]. Chosen by Odin, half of those that die in combat travel to Valhalla upon death, led by [[valkyrie]]s, while the other half go to the goddess [[Freyja]]'s field [[F<U+00F3>lkvangr]]. In Valhalla, the dead join the masses of those who have died in combat known as [[Einherjar]], as well as various legendary [[Germanic mythology|Germanic heroes]] and kings, as they prepare to aid Odin during the events of [[Ragnar<U+00F6>k]]. Before the hall stands the golden tree [[Glasir]], and the hall's ceiling is thatched with golden shields. Various creatures live around Valhalla, such as the stag [[Eik<U+00FE>yrnir]] and the goat [[Hei<U+00F0>r<U+00FA>n]], both described as standing atop Valhalla and consuming the foliage of the tree [[L<U+00E6>ra<U+00F0>r]].

Valhalla is attested in the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'', compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, the ''[[Prose Edda]]'', written in the 13th century by [[Snorri Sturluson]], in ''[[Heimskringla]]'', also written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson, and in stanzas of an anonymous 10th century poem commemorating the death of a [[Eric Bloodaxe]] known as ''[[Eir<U+00ED>ksm<U+00E1>l]]'' as compiled in ''[[Fagrskinna]]''. Valhalla has inspired various works of art, publication titles, popular culture references, and has become a term synonymous with a martial (or otherwise) hall of the chosen dead.

===''Poetic Edda''===
Valhalla is referenced at length in the ''Poetic Edda'' poem ''[[Gr<U+00ED>mnism<U+00E1>l]]'', and ''[[Helgakvi<U+00F0>a Hundingsbana II]]'', while Valhalla receives lesser direct references in in stanza 33 of the ''[[V<U+00F6>lusp<U+00E1>]]'', where the god [[Baldr]]'s death is referred to as the "woe of Valhalla", <ref name=LARRINGTON8>Larrington (1999:8).</ref> and in stanzas 1 to 3 of ''[[Hyndlulj<U+00F3><U+00F0>]]'', where the goddess [[Freyja]] states her intention of riding to Valhalla with [[Hyndla]], in an effort to help [[<U+00D3>ttar (mythology)|<U+00D3>ttar]], as well as in stanzas 6 through 7, where Valhalla is mentioned again during a dispute between the two.<ref name=LARRINGTON253-254>Larrington (1999:253<U+2013>254).</ref>

====''Gr<U+00ED>mnism<U+00E1>l''====
In stanzas 8 to 10 of ''[[Gr<U+00ED>mnism<U+00E1>l]]'', the god Odin (in the guise of ''[[List of names of Odin|Gr<U+00ED>mnir]]'') states that Valhalla is located in the realm of [[Gla<U+00F0>sheimr]]. Odin describes Valhalla as appearing shining and golden, and that it "rises peacefully" when seen from afar. From Valhalla, every day Odin chooses from those who have died in combat. Valhalla has [[spear]]-shafts for rafters, a roof thatched with shields, [[Mail (armour)|coats of mail]] are strewn over its benches, a wolf hangs in front of its west doors, and an eagle hovers above it.<ref name=LARRINGTON53>Larrington (1999:53).</ref>

From stanzas 22 to 24, more details are given by Odin about Valhalla: the holy doors of the ancient gate [[Valgrind]] stand before Valhalla, Valhalla has five [[Hundred (word)|hundred]] and forty doors that eight hundred men can exit from at once (from which the [[einherjar]] will flow forth to engage the wolf [[Fenrir]] at [[Ragnar<U+00F6>k]]). Within Valhalla exists [[Thor]]'s hall [[Bilskirnir]], and within it exist five hundred and forty rooms, and of all the halls within Valhalla, Odin states that he thinks his son's may be greatest.<ref name=LARRINGTON55>Larrington (1995:55).</ref> In stanzas 25 through 26, Odin states that the goat Hei<U+00F0>r<U+00FA>n and the [[Deer|hart]] Eik<U+00FE>yrnir stand on top of Valhalla and graze on the branches of the tree L<U+00E6>ra<U+00F0>r. Hei<U+00F0>r<U+00FA>n produces vats of [[mead]] that liquor cannot be compared to, and from Eik<U+00FE>yrnir's [[antler]]s drip liquid into the spring [[Hvergelmir]] from which flows forth all waters.<ref name=LARRINGTON55/>

====''Helgakvi<U+00F0>a Hundingsbana II''====
In stanza 38  ''[[Helgakvi<U+00F0>a Hundingsbana II]]'', the hero [[Helgi Hundingsbane]] dies and goes to Valhalla. In stanza 38, Helgi's glory there is described:
[[Image:Hundingsbane.jpg|thumb|"Hundingbane's Return to Valhal" (1912) by [[Ernest Wallcousins]].]]
<blockquote>
:So was Helgi beside the chieftains
:like the bright-growing ash beside the thorn-bush
:and the young stag, drenched in dew,
:who surpasses all other animals
:and whose horns glow against the sky itself.<ref name=LARRINGTON139>Larrington (1999:139).</ref>
</blockquote>
Prose follows after this stanza, stating that a [[Tumulus|burial-mound]] was made for Helgi, and that when Helgi arrived in Valhalla, he was asked by Odin to manage things with him. In stanza 39, Helgi, now in Valhalla, has his former enemy Hunding <U+2014> also in Valhalla <U+2014> do menial tasks; fetching foot-baths for all of the men there, kindling fire, tying dogs, keeping watch of horses, and feeding the pigs before he can get any sleep. In stanzas 40 to 42, Helgi has returned to Midgard from Valhalla with a host of men. An unnamed maid of Sigr<U+00FA>n, Helgi's valkyrie wife, sees Helgi and his large host of men riding into the mound. The maid asks if she is experiencing a delusion, if Ragnar<U+00F6>k has begun, or if Helgi and his men have been allowed to return.<ref name=LARRINGTON139/>

In the stanzas that follow, Helgi responds that none of these things have occurred, and so Sigr<U+00FA>n's maid goes home to Sigr<U+00FA>n. The maid tells Sigr<U+00FA>n that the burial mound has opened up, and that Sigr<U+00FA>n should go to Helgi there, as Helgi has asked her to come and tend his wounds, which have opened up and are bleeding. Sigr<U+00FA>n goes into the mound, and finds that Helgi is drenched in gore, his hair is thick with frost. Filled with joy at the reunion, Sigr<U+00FA>n kisses him before he can remove his coat of mail, and asks how she can heal him. Sigr<U+00FA>n makes a bed there, and the two sleep together in the enclosed burial mound. Helgi awakens, stating that he must "ride along the blood-red roads, to set the pale horse to tread the path of the sky," and  return before the rooster Salg<U+00F3>fnir crows. Helgi and the host of men ride away, and Sigr<U+00FA>n and her servant go back to their house. Sigr<U+00FA>n has her maid wait for him by the mound the next night, but when she arrives at dawn, she finds that he has not returned. The prose narrative at the end of the poem relates that Sigr<U+00FA>n dies of sadness, but that the two are thought to have been reborn as [[Helgi Haddingjaskati]] and the valkyrie [[K<U+00E1>ra]].<ref name=LARRINGTON139-141>Larrington (1999:139<U+2013>141).</ref>

===''Prose Edda''===
[[Image:Gylfe stood boldly before Odin by George Wright.jpg|thumb|"Gylfe stood boldly before Odin" (1908) by [[George Wright]].]]
[[Image:AM 738 4to Valh<U+00F6>ll.jpg|thumb|In this illustration from a 17th century [[Iceland]]ic manuscript, [[Heimdall]] is shown guarding the gate of Valhalla.]]
Valhalla is referenced in the ''Prose Edda'' books ''[[Gylfaginning]]'' and ''[[Sk<U+00E1>ldskaparm<U+00E1>l]]''.
====''Gylfaginning''====
Valhalla is first mentioned in chapter 2 of the ''Prose Edda'' book ''Gylfaginning'', where it is described partially in [[euhemerized]] form. In the chapter, [[Gylfi|King Gylfi]] sets out to [[Asgard]] in the guise of an old man going by the name of ''Gangleri'' to find the source of the power of the gods. The narrative states that the <U+00C6>sir foresaw his arrival and had prepared grand illusions for him, so that when Gangerli enters the fortress, he sees a hall of such a height that he has trouble seeing over it, and notices that the roof of the hall is covered in golden shields, as if they were shingles. Snorri then quotes a stanza by the skald [[<U+00DE>j<U+00F3><U+00F0><U+00F3>lfr of Hvinir]] (c. 900). As he continues, Gangleri sees a man in the doorway of the hall juggling short swords, and keeping seven in the air at once. Among other things, the man says that the hall belongs to his king, and adds that he can take Gangleri to the king. Gangleri follows him, and the door closes behind him. All around him he sees many living areas, and throngs of people, some of which are playing games, some are drinking, and others are fighting with weapons. Gangleri sees three thrones, and three figures sitting upon them: [[High, Just-As-High, and Third|High]] sitting on the lowest throne, [[High, Just-As-High, and Third|Just-As-High]] sitting on the next highest throne, and [[High, Just-As-High, and Third|Third]] sitting on the highest. The man guiding Gangleri tells him that High is the king of the hall.<ref name=BYOCK10-11>Byock (2005:10<U+2013>11).</ref>

In chapter 20, Third states that Odin mans Valhalla with the Einherjar: the dead who fall in battle and become Odin's adopted sons.<ref name=BYOCK31>Byock (2005:31).</ref> In chapter 36, High states that valkyries serve drinks and see to the tables in Valhalla, and ''Gr<U+00ED>mnism<U+00E1>l'' stanzas 40 to 41 are then quoted in reference to this. High continues that the valkyries are sent by Odin to every battle, where they choose who is to die, and determine victory.<ref name=BYOCK44-45>Byock (2005:44<U+2013>45).</ref>

In chapter 38, Gangleri says: "You say that all men who have fallen in battle from the beginning of the world are now with Odin in Valhalla. With what does he feed them? I should think the crowd there is large." High responds that this is indeed true, that a huge amount are already in Valhalla, but yet this amount will seem to be too few when "the wolf comes." High describes that there are never too many to feed in Valhalla, for they feast from [[S<U+00E6>hr<U+00ED>mnir]] (here described as a boar), and that this beast is cooked every day and is again whole every night. ''Gr<U+00ED>mnism<U+00E1>l'' stanza 18 is then recounted. Gangleri asks if Odin himself eats the same food as the Einherjar, and High responds that Odin needs nothing to eat <U+2014> Odin only consumes wine <U+2014> and he gives his food to his wolves [[Geri and Freki]]. ''Gr<U+00ED>mnism<U+00E1>l'' stanza 19 is then recounted. High additionally states that at sunrise, Odin sends his ravens [[Hugin and Munin]] from Valhalla to fly throughout the entire world, and they return in time for the first meal there.<ref name=BYOCK46-47>Byock (2005:46<U+2013>47).</ref>

In chapter 39, Gangleri asks about the food and drinks the Einherjar consume, and asks if only water is available there. High replies that, of course, Valhalla has food and drinks fit for kings and [[Earl|jarls]], for the mead consumed in Valhalla is produced from the udders of the goat Hei<U+00F0>r<U+00FA>n, who in turn feeds on the leaves of the "famous tree" L<U+00E6>ra<U+00F0>r. The goat produces so much mead in a day that it fills a massive vat so large that all of the Einherjar in Valhalla might satisfy their thirst from it. High further states that, more notably, the stag Eik<U+00FE>yrnir stands atop Valhalla and also chews on the branches of L<U+00E6>ra<U+00F0>r. So much moisture drips from his horns that it falls down to the well Hvelgelmir, resulting in numerous rivers.<ref name=BYOCK48>Byock (2005:48).</ref>

In chapter 40, Gangleri muses that Valhalla must be quite crowded, to which High responds by stating that Valhalla is massive and remains roomy despite the large amount of inhabitants, and then quotes ''Gr<U+00ED>mnism<U+00E1>l'' stanza 23. In chapter 41, Gangleri says that Odin seems to be quite a powerful lord, as he controls quite a big army, but he yet wonders how the Einherjar keep themselves busy when they are not drinking. High replies that daily, after they've dressed and put on their war gear, they go out to the courtyard and battle one another in one-on-one combat for sport. Then, when mealtime comes, they ride home to Valhalla and drink. High then quotes ''[[Vaf<U+00FE>r<U+00FA><U+00F0>nism<U+00E1>l]]'' stanza 41. In chapter 42, High describes that, "right at the beginning, when the gods were settling" they had established Asgard and then built Valhalla.<ref name=BYOCK49-50>Byock (2005:49-50).</ref> The death of the god Baldr is recounted in chapter 49, where the [[mistletoe]] that is used to kill Baldr is described as growing west of Valhalla.<ref name=BYOCK66>Byock (2005:66).</ref>

====''Sk<U+00E1>ldskaparm<U+00E1>l''====
[[Image:Tangelgarda Odin.jpg|thumb|The 7th century [[T<U+00E4>ngelg<U+00E5>rda stone]] depicts a figure leading a troop of warriors all bearing rings. [[Valknut]] symbols are drawn beneath his horse.]]
At the beginning of ''Sk<U+00E1>ldskaparm<U+00E1>l'', a partially euhemerized account is given of [[<U+00C6>gir]] visiting the gods in Asgard and shimmering swords are brought out and used as their sole source of light as they drink. There, numerous gods feast, they have plenty of strong [[mead]], and the hall has wall-panels covered with attractive shields.<ref name=FAULKES59>Faulkes (1995:59).</ref> This location is confirmed as Valhalla in chapter 33.<ref name=FAULKES95>Faulkes (1995:95).</ref>

In chapter 2, a quote from the anonymous 10th century poem [[Eir<U+00ED>ksm<U+00E1>l]] is provided (see the ''Fagrskinna'' section below for more detail and another translation from another source):
<blockquote>
What sort of dream is that, Odin? I dreamed I rose up before dawn to clear up Val-hall for slain people. I aroused the Einheriar, bade them get up to strew the benches, clean the beer-cups, the valkyries to serve wine for the arrival of a prince.<ref name=FAULKES69>Faulkes (1995:69).</ref>
</blockquote>

In chapter 17 of ''Sk<U+00E1>ldskaparm<U+00E1>l'', the [[j<U+00F6>tunn]] [[Hrungnir]] is in a rage and, while attempting to catch up and attack Odin on his steed [[Sleipnir]], ends up at the doors to Valhalla. There, the <U+00C6>sir invite him in for a drink. Hrungnir goes in, demands a drink, and becomes drunk and belligerent, stating that he will remove Valhalla and take it to the land of the j<U+00F6>tunn, [[J<U+00F6>tunheimr]], among various other things. Eventually, the gods tire of his boasting and invoke Thor, who arrives. Hrungnir states that Thor is under their protection, and subsequently he can't be harmed while in Valhalla. After an exchange of words, Hrungnir challenges Thor to a duel at the location of [[Griotunagardar]], resulting in Hrungnir's death.<ref name=FAULKES77-78>Faulkes (1995:77<U+2013>78).</ref>

In chapter 34, the tree [[Glasir]] is stated as located in front of the doors of Valhalla. The tree is described as having foliage of red gold and being the most beautiful tree among both gods and men. A quote from a work by the 9th century skald [[Bragi Boddason]] is presented that confirms the description.<ref name=FAULKES96>Faulkes (1995:96).</ref>

===''Heimskringla''===
Valhalla is mentioned in [[euhemerized]] form and as an element of remaining [[Norse paganism|Norse pagan]] belief in ''[[Heimskringla]]''. In chapter 8 of ''[[Ynglinga saga]]'', the "historical" Odin is described as ordaining burial laws over his country. These laws include that all the dead are to be burned on a pyre on a burial mound with their possessions, and their ashes are to be brought out to sea or buried in the earth. The dead would then arrive in Valhalla with everything that one had on their pyre, and whatever one had hidden in the ground.<ref name=HOLLANDER12>Hollander (2007:12).</ref> Valhalla is additionally referenced in the phrase "visiting Odin" in a work by the 10th century skald [[<U+00DE>j<U+00F3><U+00F0><U+00F3>lfr of Hvinir]] describing that, upon his death, [[Vanlandi|King Vanlandi]] went to Valhalla.<ref name=HOLLANDER17>Hollander (2007:17).</ref>

In chapter 32 of ''H<U+00E1>konar saga G<U+00F3><U+00F0>a'', [[Haakon I of Norway]] is given a [[Norse paganism|pagan]] burial, which is described as sending him on his way to Valhalla. Verses from ''[[H<U+00E1>konarm<U+00E1>l]]'' are then quoted in support, themselves containing references to Valhalla.<ref name=HOLLANDER125>Hollander (2007:125).</ref>

===''Fagrskinna''===
[[Image:Welcoming scene on Stenbro stone.JPG|right|thumb|The Stenbro [[picture stone]] on [[Gotland]] is one of several image stones that depict a dead man being received by a Valkyrie in the afterlife.]]
[[Image:Heimdallr and valkyries by Fr<U+00F8>lich.jpg|thumb|A depiction of valkyries encountering the god [[Heimdallr]] as they carry a dead man to Valhalla (1906) by [[Lorenz Fr<U+00F8>lich]].]]
In chapter 8 of ''[[Fagrskinna]]'', a prose narrative states that, after the death of her husband [[Eric Bloodaxe]], [[Gunnhild Mother of Kings]] had a poem composed about him. The composition is by an anonymous author from the 10th century and is referred to as ''[[Eir<U+00ED>ksm<U+00E1>l]]'', and describes Eric Bloodaxe and five other kings arriving in Valhalla after their death. The poem begins with comments by Odin (as Old Norse ''<U+00D3><U+00F0>inn''):
<blockquote>
:'What kind of a dream is it,' said <U+00D3><U+00F0>inn,
:in which just before daybreak,
:I thought I cleared Valh<U+01EB>ll,
:for coming of slain men?
:I waked the Einherjar,
:bade valkyries rise up,
:to strew the bench,
:and scour the beakers,

:wine to carry,
:as for a king's coming,
:here to me I expect
:heroes' coming from the world,
:certain great ones,
:so glad is my heart.<ref name=FINLAY58>Finlay (2004:58).</ref>
</blockquote>
The god [[Bragi]] asks where a thundering sound is coming from, and says that the benches of Valhalla are creaking <U+2014> as if the god Baldr had returned to Valhalla <U+2014> and that it sounds like the movement of a thousand. Odin responds that Bragi knows well that the sounds are for Eric Bloodaxe, who will soon arrive in Valhalla. Odin tells the heroes [[Sigmund]] and [[Sinfj<U+00F6>tli]] to rise to greet Eric and invite him into the hall, if it is indeed he.<ref name=FINLAY59>Finlay (2004:59).</ref>

Sigmund asks Odin why he would expect Eric more than any other king, to which Odin responds that Eric has reddened his gore-drenched sword with many other lands. Eric arrives, and Sigmund greets him, tells him that he is welcome to come into the hall, and asks him what other lords he has brought with him to Valhalla. Eric says that with him are five kings, that he will tell them the name of them all, and that he, himself, is the sixth.<ref name=FINLAY59/>

==Modern influence==

[[Image:Walhalla aussen.jpg|thumb|The [[Walhalla temple]] above the [[Danube]] near [[Regensburg]], Germany.]]
[[Image:Walhalla 1910 view4.jpg|thumb|Walhalla, Victoria, Australia township in 1910]]
The term has had some influence in modern popular culture, either directly influenced by the concept of Norse mythology or referring simply to a gathering of the chosen dead or a hall in honor of them. Examples of the latter include the [[Walhalla temple]] built by [[Leo von Klenze]] for [[Ludwig I of Bavaria]] between 1830-1847 near [[Regensburg]], [[Germany]], and the Tresco Abbey Gardens Valhalla museum built by August Smith around  1830 to house [[Figurehead (object)|ship figureheads]] from shipwrecks that occurred at the [[Isles of Scilly]], [[England]], where the museum is located.<ref name=SIMEK348TRESCO>Simek (2007:348), and from {{cite web|url=http://www.tresco.co.uk/stay/abbey-garden/valhalla/|title=Tresco Abbey Gardens Valhalla|work=Tresco in the Isles of Scilly UK|accessdate=2008-09-06|publisher=Tresco Estate}}</ref> A crater, [[Valhalla (crater)|Valhalla]], located on the [[planet]] [[Jupiter]]'s [[natural satellite|moon]] [[Callisto (moon)|Callisto]], is named after the hall.

References to Valhalla appear in literature, art, and other forms of media. Examples include K. Ehrenberg's charcoal illustration "Gastmahl in Walhalla (mit einziehenden Einheriern)" (1880), [[Richard Wagner]]'s depiction of Valhalla in his opera cycle ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'' (1848<U+2014>1874), the [[Munich]], Germany-based [[Germanic Neopaganism|Germanic Neopagan]] magazine ''Walhalla'' (1905-1913), and the comic series ''[[Valhalla (comic)|Valhalla]]'' (1978, ongoing) by Peter Madsen, and its subsequent animated film of the [[Valhalla (film)|same name]] (1986).<ref name=SIMEK348>Simek (2007:348).</ref> Valhalla is prominently referenced<U+2014>with the line "Valhalla, I am coming"<U+2014>in the [[Led Zeppelin]] [[hit single]] "[[Immigrant Song]]" (1970).<ref name=WELCH47>Welch (2005:47).</ref>

Valhalla is referenced in the [[video game]] titles ''[[Valhalla (video game)|Valhalla]]'' (1983), ''[[Valhalla: Before the War]]'' (1995), and ''[[Valhalla Knights]]'' (2006). Amusement park attractions named after Valhalla include  ''Valhalla Borgen'' in [[Tivoli Gardens]] in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]]<ref>{{da}} {{cite web |title=Valhalla Borgen |url=http://www.aok.dk/byen-rundt/tivoli-valhalla-borgen |accessdate=2009-07-08 |work= |publisher=http://www.aok.dk |date= }}</ref> and ''[[Valhalla (Pleasure Beach Blackpool)|Valhalla]]'' in [[Pleasure Beach Blackpool]] in [[Blackpool]], [[England]].

Locations named after Valhalla exist in [[North America]] (including [[Valhalla, New York]], [[Valhalla Centre, Alberta]], [[Walhalla, Michigan]], [[Walhalla, North Dakota]], [[Walhalla, South Carolina]], and [[Walhalla, Texas]]), [[Australia]] ([[Walhalla, Victoria]]), and [[South Africa]] (Valhalla, [[Pretoria]]).

The musical group, [[Frank Black and the Catholics]], mentioned Valhalla, in their song, called, "[[Bullet (song)]]".
