==Geography and environment==

Located in the [[California Central Valley|Central Valley]], Tracy sits atop fertile agricultural lands, which have come under increasing development pressure as the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]'s [[overpopulation|vigorous population growth]] has spilled over into the Tracy area as well as other locations near the Bay Area's edge.  Because of the historic use of [[DDT]] on area row crops, there are residual issues of [[soil contamination]] from this substance and related persistent chemicals.<ref>''Phase One Environmental Site Assessment, Circle B Ranch, Tracy, California'', Earth Metrics Inc, San Mateo, Ca., October 16, 1989</ref>  There is a historic area [[chloroform]] [[groundwater]] plume associated with [[Georgia Pacific]] operations in the area.  Faults considered active in the Tracy area are the [[Black Butte Fault]], [[Midway Fault]] and Carnegie Corral Fault.<ref>[http://www.ci.tracy.ca.us/projects/general_plan/docs/draft_safety_element_june_2005.pdf Seismic Safety Element of the General Plan, city of Tracy, California]</ref>  The San Joaquin Fault traverses the Tracy area and is a potential source of risk for [[seismic]] events.<ref>J.

* [[Kathy Griffin]] recorded her CD "Kathy Griffin: For Your Consideration" live on February 17, 2008 at the ETK Theatre at the Grand Theatre Center for the Arts in Tracy.
*  The city gained notoriety in December, 2008 after a 16-year-old battered and emaciated boy - with shackled feet and wearing nothing but boxer shorts - escaped the Tracy home where he was being held prisoner by climbing over a sound wall to a nearby fitness center. Those accused of holding the boy prisoner and of torturing him were the married couple who lived in the home and the boy's former guardian, who was also staying in the home.
