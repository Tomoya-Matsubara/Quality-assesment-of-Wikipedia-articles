'''Gerard Michael "Gerry" Kelly''' (18 September 1908 <U+2013> 1983) was an [[English people|English]] [[association football|footballer]].

==Playing career==
Kelly left Hylton Colliery at the age of 19 to sign for [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] in 1927. He never made the first team and the following year joined [[Nelson F.C.|Nelson]], who he played almost 50 games for. He signed with [[Huddersfield Town F.C.|Huddersfield Town]] in 1929 and in two years with the club scored 15 goals in 37 league appearances.<ref>99 Years & Counting - Stats & Stories - Huddersfield Town History</ref> In 1932 he signed with [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]], staying for a year before joining [[Chester City F.C.|Chester City]]. He made 73 appearances for Chester over four years with the club, before joining [[Port Vale F.C.|Port Vale]] for 'a substantial fee' in June 1936. Starting off firmly in the first 11, his place slipped away over the [[1936<U+2013>37 Port Vale F.C. season|1936<U+2013>37 season]] and by August 1937 he was given a [[free transfer (football)|free transfer]] to [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Kent|first=Jeff|title=Port Vale Personalities|publisher=Witan Books|page=161|year=1996|isbn=0-9529152-0-0|url=http://www.amazon.ca/Port-Vale-Personalities-Jeff-Kent/dp/0952915200}}</ref>

A very quick right-winger who could also play as a centre-forward, he arrived at [[The Dell (Southampton)|The Dell]] to add depth to the Southampton forward line. Although he brought a wealth of experience with him, he spent most of his time in the reserves and in his two years on the south coast, he made only 19 first-team appearances, scoring twice.<ref name = "ABC">{{cite book | title=The Alphabet of the Saints|last= Holley |first= Duncan |coauthors= Chalk, Gary| publisher= ACL & Polar Publishing | year=1992| isbn=0-9514862-3-3|page=194}}</ref>
