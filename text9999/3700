'''Sondhi Limthongkul''' ({{lang-th|<U+0E2A><U+0E19><U+0E18><U+0E34> <U+0E25><U+0E34><U+0E49><U+0E21><U+0E17><U+0E2D><U+0E07><U+0E01><U+0E38><U+0E25>}}; {{zh-tp|t=<U+6797><U+660E><U+9054>|p=Lin Mingda}}, born 7 November 1947) is Thai [[media mogul]] and leader of the right-wing [[People's Alliance for Democracy]] (PAD).  Starting his career as a journalist, he later founded ''[[Manager Daily]]'' newspaper as well as satellite broadcaster ASTV.  Originally a strong supporter of former Prime Minister [[Thaksin Shinawatra]], he later became a leader of the anti-Thaksin movement.  Under his leadership, the PAD was the major player in the [[2005<U+2013>2006 Thai political crisis]] that led to the [[2006 Thailand coup|2006 military coup]] that toppled the Thaksin government.  When Thaksin affiliated parties won the [[Thai general election, 2007|2007 general election]], Sondhi became the major player in the [[2008<U+2013>2009 Thai political crisis]], leading the PAD in violent clashes with security forces and anti-PAD protestors as well as the seizure of Government House, [[Don Muang Airport]], and [[Suvarnabhumi Airport]].  Sondhi is a supporter of the [[Democrat Party (Thailand)|Democrat Party]] and stopped the PAD's protests after Democrat leader [[Abhisit Vejjajiva]] was appointed Prime Minister.  Sondhi was shot and slightly wounded after the military cracked down on anti-government riots in April 2009.  It was not clear who ordered the assassination, although the PAD's spokesman speculated that a faction of the military or police could have been behind it.

Sondhi founded ''Manager Daily'' in 1982 after several ventures in publishing.  The newspaper became his personal mouthpiece, and he used the profits to build a publishing, broadcasting, and telecommunications empire.  By 1996, he had over US$600 million in assets.  His business faced a meltdown following the [[Asian Financial Crisis]] of 1997, forcing him into bankruptcy and sparking investigations into irregular inter-company transactions.  Immediately after the crisis, Sondhi furiously attacked the [[Democrat Party (Thailand)|Democrat]]-led government over its management of the economic recovery.  With the election of Thaksin Shinawatra as Prime Minister in 2001, several of Sondhi's associates became leaders in the new government.  His banker, Viroj Nualkhair, became president of state-owned Krung Thai Bank and gave more than a billion baht in "debt forgiveness" to Sondhi, allowing him to emerge from bankruptcy.  Sondhi became a vocal supporter of Thaksin, calling him "the best prime minister our country has ever had."<ref>The Nation, [http://www.nationmultimedia.com/specials/sondhi/r50.php Old views haunt govt critic], 7 December 2005</ref>

In 2005, Viroj Nualkhair was dismissed from the KTB after incurring over 40 billion baht in problem loans.  Sondhi then began criticizing Thaksin using the media under his control, including satellite broadcaster ASTV.  He founded the [[People's Alliance for Democracy]], aimed at overthrowing the Thaksin government.  The PAD dissolved after a [[2006 Thailand coup|military coup]] against Thaksin, but when Thaksin-affiliated parties won a post-coup election, the PAD reformed and renewed its protests.  In 2008, he and PAD forces occupied Government House and barricaded themselves inside.

==Early life and career (pre-1982)==
Sondhi was born in [[Bangkok]] to [[Thai Chinese|Chinese immigrant parents]] from [[Hainan]]<ref>[http://216.109.125.130/search/cache?p=limthongkul+hainan&fr=yfp-t-501&toggle=1&ei=UTF-8&vc=&fp_ip=SG&u=thestar.com.my/services/printerfriendly.asp%3Ffile%3D/2006/4/9/focus/13914947.asp%26sec%3Dfocus&w=limthongkul+hainan&d=PKNIzfmdOl5L&icp=1&.intl=us The man who took on Thaksin]</ref><ref>[http://www.shop.com/op/aprod-p29074025-k24-g1-~encyclopedia+of+chinese+overseas-nover The Encyclopedia of Chinese Overseas, by Lynn Pan ISBN-13: 978-0674252103]</ref>.  He majored in history at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], where he was a reporter for the student newspaper, ''[[Daily Bruin|The Daily Bruin]]'', from 1966 to 1969. He received his M.A. from Utah State University in 1972.

Returning to Thailand, he worked for the newspaper ''Prachatipatai'' (Democracy) as a reporter and managing editor from 1973 to 1974.  He wrote several exposes of the political developments that led to the bloodshed on October 14, 1973, an event that brought the military controlled government down and began a period of democracy.

In 1976, he set up the Advance Media Group with real estate investor Paul Sittiamnuay. The group produced four publications, including a short-lived English-language daily called ''Business Times'' (not connected with the current ''Business Times''), with Sondhi as an editor. The newspaper collapsed after Paul Sittiamnuay was investigated over a real estate scandal, went bankrupt and fled the country. 

In 1979, Sondhi set up his own company, Karawek, which published a women's magazine, ''Pooying'', from 1980 to 1982.

==The Manager era (1982-1997)==

In 1982, Sondhi established the business monthly ''Phoojatkarn'' (Manager), which he produced in a room in his father's house.  ''Phoojatkarn Monthly'' was soon a success, and four years later Sondhi began a weekly with the same name.  He later published a daily newspaper, ''Phoojadkarn Rai Wan''.  Phoojatkarn Daily has often been regarded as Sondhi's personal mouthpiece.

Sondhi eventually established a publishing house called the Manager Group (also known as the M Group), as a holding company for his media outlets.  Among the companies he purchased were the IT firms SCT and Micronetic, and the handset retailer IEC. IEC was the exclusive handset retailer for [[Nokia]] phones, and its major customers were the two rival mobile-phone groups [[Advanced Info Service]], which belonged to future prime minister [[Thaksin Shinawatra]], and Total Access Communication (later known as DTAC). 

During this period, Sondhi also expanded into English-language publishing, with an English edition of ''Manager'', the Hong Kong-based monthly ''Asia Inc'', and the regional daily newspaper ''[[Asia Times]]''. He briefly owned a local lifestyle magazine in Los Angeles known as ''Buzz''. Sondhi was characterized in the media as an "Asian Rupert Murdoch," and he hired aggressively, bringing in both Asian and Western journalists. ''Asia Inc'' was eventually sold, and went through several ownership changes. It is currently owned by Singapore-based Edge Asia Inc Media Group. ''Asia Times'' folded in 1997, though an online edition, run by some of the paper's former staff, continues to operate [[Asia Times Online]].

Before taking IEC public in 1992, Sondhi allotted a 17.5 per cent stake in the company to Thaksin. Thaksin bought the stake at Bt10 per share. After the listing, IEC's share price shot up to THB 250 each and Thaksin sold out his stake. Sondhi said Thaksin made between THB 600 million to THB 700 million from the IEC float. Sondhi wrote in his book, "One Must Know How To Lose Before Knowing How To Win", that he felt that Thaksin was a free rider and did not want to do business with him.

The Manager Group-led Asia Broadcasting and Communications Network (ABCN) set up its satellite project, Lao Star Co - which was worth about THB 9 billion - as a joint venture with the Laotian government in 1995. Lao Star appointed Space System/Loral to build two L-Star satellites and L-Star 1 was set to officially launch to provide digital direct-to-home TV programmes in 1998. L-Star 2 was to be put into orbit in 1999. The project was planned to serve around 2 billion people in the Asia Pacific region, including India and China. Later ABCN enlisted DTAC's parent, United Communication Industry Plc (Ucom), to back its business. 

IEC also provided a bulk of the mobile-phone airtime to DTAC before purchasing the 1800 MHz frequency from DTAC to develop its own mobile-phone operator Wireless Communication Service (WCS). WCS offered the service under the brand Digital 01. 

Sondhi expanded and diversified widely.  He owned a hotel in China<U+2019>s [[Yunnan]] province, ran a cement factory in [[Vietnam]], and set up a regional business conference company.  Most of his investments were woven in a complex series of cross-shareholdings.  Sondhi himself kept few direct holdings in any of the companies, but was ultimately in control through his ownership of holding companies like [[M Group]] and other holding companies registered in the British Virgin Islands.  Such a structure minimized Sondhi's tax bill and provided maximum protection in case of financial difficulties.<ref>The Nation, [http://friskodude.blogspot.com/2005_11_01_friskodude_archive.html Speedy demise for Sondhi's empire], 12 April 2002</ref>

In 1996, Fortune magazine had put Sondhi's assets at USD 600 million (or THB 12 billion at the exchange-rate of THB 25 to a US dollar). He received an [[honorary doctorate]] from [[Chiang Mai University]].  He often travelled around Thailand in a chartered personal business jet from [[Thai Airways]] and was often seen escorting Chinese movie star [[Gong Li]].<ref>[http://www.nationmultimedia.com/search/page.arcview.php?clid=6&id=58470 The Nation, "Speedy demise for Sondhi<U+2019>s empire", 12 April 2002]</ref>

==Bankruptcy and anti-Democrat period (1997-2001)==
Following the [[Asian Financial Crisis]] of 1997, Sondhi's satellite and publishing businesses faced a meltdown. His WCS was sold to the [[Charoen Pokphand|CP Group]] before it was renamed TA Orange and later became True Move. The Manager Group was saddled with THB 20 billion in debt but only THB 4 billion in equity. The Manager Group's holding company alone had liabilities of THB 6 billion. Manager Media had Bt4.7 billion in debt. Sondhi was personally in debt for THB 1.5 billion. Sondhi ended up declaring himself bankrupt for three years. This meant that his THB 1.5 billion debt could be claimed from whatever was in his personal account for a span three years, rather than having to repay the debt over 15 or 20 years as earlier scheduled.

Sondhi's companies were also investigated for irregular inter-company transactions.  IEC guaranteed a THB 1.2 billion baht loan by M group in 1996, but never disclosed this guarantee to the public.  M Group later defaulted on the loan, sending IEC into bankruptcy<ref>[http://bankrupt.com/TCRAP_Public/991101.MBX Troubled Company Reporter, "SET orders loan guarantee report", 1 November 1999]</ref>

Auditors of Eastern Printing, Sondhi's [[Stock Exchange of Thailand|SET]]-listed printing company, noted that its huge losses partially stemmed from loans to associated companies and the establishment of off-balance accounts to related publishing companies. For example, in its 2000 financial statement, Sondhi-linked companies Asia Inc and FRYE Smith (USA) Co owed Bt59.86 million and Bt125.79 million respectively to Eastern Printing.  Likewise, according to its 2000 financial statements, Manager Media lent Bt1.061 billion to related publishers, under guarantee from Sondhi.<ref>[http://www.nationmultimedia.com/search/page.arcview.php?clid=6&id=58312 The Nation, "A fallen empire finds new lease on life", 10 April 2002]</ref>

The Manager Group furiously attacked the [[Democrat Party (Thailand)|Democrat]]-led government over its management of the economic crisis during its time in office from late 1997 to 2000. This included scathing attacks on Finance Minister [[Tharin Nimmanhaeminda]] for his emergency financing agreements with the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] and Deputy Prime Minister Sawit Bhodhivihok for his policy of privatizing the state-owned electricity sector.

==The Thaksin Era (2001-2006)==
===Pro-Thaksin Period===
After the election of Thaksin Shinawatra as Prime Minister in 2001, [[Manager Daily]] lauded Thaksin's leadership, calling him Thailand's best prime minister ever. [[Somkid Jatusripitak]], co-founder of the Manager Media Group and writer of a column for [[Manager Daily]] became Thaksin's commerce and finance minister[http://www.nationmultimedia.com/search/page.arcview.php?clid=6&id=58371].  [[Pansak Vinyaratan]], previously editor of the now defunct Sondhi-owned [[Asia Times Online|Asia Times]], became Thaksin's chief policy adviser. [[Chai-anan Samudvanija]], who chaired IEC and was head of several of Sondhi's foundations, won prominent jobs at state-owned [[Krung Thai Bank]] and [[Thai Airways|Thai Airways International]]. Kanok Abhiradee, the head of one of Sondhi's companies, became president of [[Thai Airways]]. [[Viroj Nualkhair]], Sondhi's former banker, replaced [[Sirin Nimmanhaeminda]] as president of the state-owned Krung Thai Bank.<ref>The Nation, [http://www.nationmultimedia.com/search/page.arcview.php?clid=6&id=58371]</ref> Under Viroj's management, the debt that Manager Group owed to Krung Thai Bank was reduced from Bt1.8 billion to THB 200 million. 

Emerging from bankruptcy, Sondhi started his own TV show, 'Thailand Weekly' airing on the [[MCOT]]'s channel and co-hosted by [[Sarocha Pornudomsak]]. He also invested in two TV channels, 11/1 and 11/2 - a split from Television of Thailand Channel 11.  A Democrat MP alleged that the Thaksin government gave favors to Sondhi and his companies[http://www.nationmultimedia.com/search/page.arcview.php?clid=6&id=58371].

In July 2003, Sondhi wrote in his newspaper predicting the [[US Dollar]]'s failure in 2010 and at the same time suggested Thai people [[Gold as an investment|invest in gold]].

===Origins of the Anti-Thaksin Period===
[[Image:Muangthai Rai Sapda.jpg|thumb|Muangthai Rai Sapda at Suan Lumphini]]

In 2004, state-owned [[Krung Thai Bank]] (KTB) shocked Thailand's financial world by reclassifying approximately Bt40 billion as problem loans.  It was rumored that [[Pridiyathorn Devakula|M.R. Pridiyathorn Devakula]], the [[Bank of Thailand]]'s governor, would fire KTB CEO Viroj Nualkhair if he did not resign voluntarily. Viroj Nualkhair was Sondhi's former financial advisor, having helped him [[Initial public offering|IPO]] one of his first companies.<ref>[http://www.nationmultimedia.com/search/page.arcview.php?clid=6&id=58371 The Nation, "New party, old friends aid Sondhi", 11 April 2002]</ref>  As Krung Thai Bank's CEO, Viroj had forgiven Sondhi's debts by Bt1.6 billion and arranged for further rounds of forgiveness. Using all of his media outlets, Sondhi furiously attacked Pridiyathorn and defended Viroj. However, Viroj was eventually forced to leave Krung Thai Bank.  Sondhi's public criticism of Thaksin increased.<ref>The Nation, [http://www.nationmultimedia.com/specials/sondhi/nov30.php The good old days], 30 November 2005</ref>

In July 2004, Sondhi's Channel 11/1 was temporarily ordered to stop broadcasting because of a contract dispute between cable operator UBC and the government regulator.<ref>[http://www.asiamedia.ucla.edu/article.asp?parentid=12552 Bangkok Post, UBC complies, drops channel, 2 July 2004]</ref><ref>[http://www.asiamedia.ucla.edu/article.asp?parentid=12621] Bangkok Post, "UBC to resume televising Channel 11/1", 8 July 2004</ref>  Sondhi's criticism of Thaksin grew steadily throughout 2004 and 2005, with weekly attacks on his ''Muangthai Rai Sapda'' (Thailand Weekly) television show getting much attention.

In September 2005, [[MCOT]] (broadcaster of Channel 9), in response to allegations that ''Muangthai Rai Sapda'' had made inappropriate references to the monarchy, cancelled the program.<ref>[http://www.nationmultimedia.com/specials/sondhi/r17.php The Nation, "Ch 9 drops Sondhi for royal references", 16 September 2005]</ref> However, Sondhi felt he was dropped for criticising the Thaksin government. He subsequently started broadcasting his talk show via satellite and [[webcasting]] it on the website of one of his newspapers, doubling his daily number of site visitors.[http://directory.truehits.net/trafficweb/index.php?url=www.manager.co.th]

===The Luang Ta Maha Bua incident===

On 27 September 2005, ''Phoochatkarn Daily'' published a sermon by [[Luang Ta Maha Bua]], a popular but outspoken Buddhist [[monk]] [http://www.manager.co.th/Politics/ViewNews.aspx?NewsID=9480000132593][http://sanpaworn.vissaventure.com/?id=198].  The sermon was seen by many as extremely critical of Thaksin, especially as it came from a monk.  Especially controversial were the following passages: 

''"They complained to me about PM Thaksin and Mr. Visanu and two other people that I don<U+2019>t remember. This is the big ogre ({{lang-th|<U+0E15><U+0E31><U+0E27><U+0E22><U+0E31><U+0E01><U+0E29><U+0E4C><U+0E43><U+0E2B><U+0E0D><U+0E48>}}), big power. Atrocious power will swallow our country, bite the liver and lungs and aim for the presidency....He will put a torch to the country.  He will never listen....This savagery and atrocity appear in every aspect of him.... All he has are things to be used for burning."''

''"He is clearly aiming for the presidency now.  The monarch trampled, the religion trampled, the country trampled, by this savage and atrocious power in a few people in the government circle. That is the circle of ogres, of ghosts, of trolls, of demons ({{lang-th|<U+0E22><U+0E31><U+0E01><U+0E29><U+0E4C><U+0E27><U+0E07><U+0E1C><U+0E35><U+0E27><U+0E07><U+0E40><U+0E1B><U+0E23><U+0E15><U+0E27><U+0E07><U+0E21><U+0E32><U+0E23>}}), all in there....So even Devadatta [an enemy of the Buddha] saw the harm he caused, and he was rewarded for his good deed. He would attain Buddhahood ({{lang-th|<U+0E1E><U+0E23><U+0E30><U+0E1B><U+0E31><U+0E08><U+0E40><U+0E08><U+0E01><U+0E1E><U+0E38><U+0E17><U+0E18><U+0E40><U+0E08><U+0E49><U+0E32>}}). For those who have made mistakes, if we see the harm we cause, we can still get by. But what is it with Thailand? What kind of governance?"

''"They even dare to accuse Luangta Maha Bua of playing politics. Politics, dog shit ({{lang-th|<U+0E01><U+0E32><U+0E23><U+0E1A><U+0E49><U+0E32><U+0E19><U+0E01><U+0E32><U+0E23><U+0E40><U+0E21><U+0E37><U+0E2D><U+0E07><U+0E02><U+0E35><U+0E49><U+0E2B><U+0E21><U+0E32><U+0E2D><U+0E30><U+0E44><U+0E23>}}). There<U+2019>s only shit all over the country. I brought the Buddha<U+2019>s [[dharma]] to cleanse in order for them to repent and recognize good and evil. Because they<U+2019>re the government. The world flatters them as smart people, but don<U+2019>t be smart down in the toilet ({{lang-th|<U+0E41><U+0E15><U+0E48><U+0E2D><U+0E22><U+0E48><U+0E32><U+0E09><U+0E25><U+0E32><U+0E14><U+0E25><U+0E07><U+0E2A><U+0E49><U+0E27><U+0E21><U+0E25><U+0E07><U+0E16><U+0E32><U+0E19>}}). Don<U+2019>t be smart about putting a torch to the head of everyone in the country, from Nation, Religion, and Monarchy on down. These people will get burned unless they recognize the truth. I<U+2019>m saddened by all this. How does this come about?"''

Thailand has no office of a presidency. The King is the head of state, and the prime minister is the head of government. A president would replace the King - an unthinkable affront to the Thais<U+2019> reverence for their monarchy.  Accusations of aspiration to a presidency are one of the most severe and rare criticisms a Thai politician can receive.

On 11 October 2005, Thaksin sued Sondhi and Manager newspaper for Bt500 million [http://www.nationmultimedia.com/specials/sondhi/r24.php].  As monks have traditionally been above criticism, Thaksin could not sue Luang Ta Maha Bua.  "This is an exercise of an individual's right to protect his reputation and privacy. The newspaper did not criticise the prime minister fairly as a public official, but rather it took him to task personally, using harsh words, which was damaging to him," said Thana Benjathikul, Thaksin's lawyer.  

Thaksin was immediately attacked by Sondhi and accused of gagging the press.  Sondhi's lawyer, Suwat Apaipakdi, said that "every newspaper reproduced his [Luang Ta Maha Bua] comments. Why did Thaksin not sue him [Luang Ta Maha Bua]? He chose to sue only the Manager Media Group because it's linked to Khun Sondhi".  Thaksin's legal team noted that other newspapers only published selected passages of the sermon, and furthermore, Sondhi had used an allegedly slanderous headline.  Respected civil rights lawyer Thongbai Thongpao noted that Thaksin's lawsuit did have merit.  He said the lawsuits "do not constitute an attack on freedom of the press"[http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/GK02Ae01.html].

The law suit, along with several other libel cases, was withdrawn after King [[Bhumibol Adulyadej]] indirectly advised against such legal action during his annual birthday speech.

[[Luang Ta Maha Bua]] has made several appearances at Sondhi's anti-Thaksin talkshows, and has continued to give sermons attacking the former prime minister.

=== The Royal Power / Temple of the Emerald Buddha incident ===
On 10 April 2005, Thaksin Shinawatra presided over a merit-making ceremony at the [[Temple of the Emerald Buddha]], which is within the walls of the Grand Palace and contains the most revered Buddha figure in Thailand.  Starting October 2005, the website of Phoochatkarn newspaper [http://www.manager.co.th] ran an article alleging that the Prime Minister had usurped a royal function of the King by presiding over the ceremony.  This led Sondhi to start using "We Love the King", "We Will Fight for the King", and "Return Power to the King" as his key anti-Thaksin rallying slogans.  This allegation has been repeated in Thaksin's "Thailand Weekly" live tapings.  It also became a staple of the thaiinsider.com website of [[Ekkayuth Anchanbutr]], operator of the Charter pyramid scheme.  A widely circulated anonymous spam email showed a picture of Thaksin sitting on a chair normally used by the King and asking, "People are familiar with images only of the King and members of the Royal Family, all dressed in royal uniforms and decorated with full regalia, presiding over grand ceremonies in the temple<U+2019>s main chapel. Yet this picture makes me think: What has happened to our country?".  

On 9 November 2005, Cabinet secretary-general Bovornsak Uwanno claimed that King [[Bhumibol Adulyadej]] had granted permission to Prime Minister Thaksin to preside over a grand merit-making ceremony [http://nationmultimedia.com/2005/11/10/national/index.php?news=national_19114638.html].  This was corroborated by Chaktham Thammasak, who was director-general of the Bureau of National Buddhism at the time of the event.  Chaktham stated that the Royal Household Bureau arranged every aspect of the ceremony, including the positioning of the chairs [http://nationmultimedia.com/2005/11/11/headlines/index.php?news=headlines_19127252.html].  

On 17 November 2005, the Civil Court issued a gag order on Sondhi to prevent him from making further "royal powers" allegations [http://nationmultimedia.com/2005/11/17/headlines/index.php?news=headlines_19189415.html].  This immediately prompted Sondhi to attack Thaksin and accuse him of restricting press freedom.  

Sondhi was investigated on two counts of lese-majesty [http://www.nationmultimedia.com/specials/sondhi/r26.php] against King [[Bhumibol Adulyadej]].  Counter-charges of lese-majesty were filed against Prime Minister Thaksin.

On 18 November, Supreme Commander General Ruengroj Mahasaranond harshly warned Sondhi against using the King as a political tool. <U+201C>Our patience is reaching the breaking point. We may take action if Sondhi does not cease his criticism by citing the monarchy<U+201D> [http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2005/11/18/headlines/index.php?news=headlines_19197899.html].

All charges were dropped after King [[Bhumibol Adulyadej]] advised against further action in his birthday speech on 5 December 2005.  However, Sondhi continues to use "We Will Fight for the King" and "Return Power to the King" as rallying cries in his anti-Thaksin protests.

===Ongoing political activism===

: {{main|Thailand political crisis 2005-2006}}

[[Image:From anti-Thaksin demonstration.jpg|right|thumb|left|A protester wears a [[tank top]] with the anti-[[Thaksin Shinawatra|Thaksin]] slogan "We will fight for the King". Sondhi sold such t-shirts during public tapings of his television show.]]  

Sondhi hosted an own outdoor talk show throughout late 2005 and early 2006 at [[Thammasat University]] and in [[Lumphini Park]] with his slogan, "We Fight for the King".  His broadcasts/protests, which later became the core of the [[People's Alliance for Democracy]] attracted many protesters, with the largest one on February 4, 2006 at the Royal Plaza drawing between 40,000 - 50,000 (foreign media estimates) and 100,000 (local media estimates) protestors.<ref>[http://english.epochtimes.com/news/6-2-4/37778.html The Epoch Times | Huge Rally Calls for Thai PM's Resignation<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/afp_asiapacific/view/196346/1/.html Channelnewsasia.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  The talk show protests were broadcast [[online]] via the [http://www.manager.co.th ManagerOnline] web site, generating nearly a twofold increase in site visitors, from an average of 80,000 to 150,000 visitors per day{{Fact|date=February 2007}}.

Protests led by Sondhi took on an increasingly critical tone. At a protest in late February 2006, social activist and Buddhist lay leader [[Sulak Sivaraksa]] called Thaksin a pitiful dog, while Auychai Watha, chairman of a north-eastern teachers' group, called for Thaksin's children to "become whores infected with venereal disease."  The conduct of the protesters was condemned by the chairman of [[Amnesty International]]'s Thailand office.  Protesters often harassed journalists and news crews.<ref>The Nation, [http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/03/01/opinion/opinion_20001744.php Non-violence is not simply the absence of physical violence], 1 March 2006</ref>

Sondhi was harshly criticized for attempting to use the King for his own benefit.<ref>[http://www.nationmultimedia.com/specials/sondhi/r22.php The Nation, "Policeman sues media tycoon for lese majeste", 9 November 2005]</ref><ref>[http://www.nationmultimedia.com/specials/sondhi/r5.php The Nation, "Sondhi gets 'warning' letter from guardsmen", 17 November 2005]</ref>

Nevertheless, Sondhi's income skyrocketed as a result of his political activism.  Revenues of his media companies increased by no less than 215 million [[baht]] (approx $6 million US) a month from the start of his protests to early 2006.<ref><U+0E42><U+0E1E><U+0E2A><U+0E17><U+0E39><U+0E40><U+0E14><U+0E22><U+0E4C>, "<U+0E41><U+0E09><U+0E2D><U+0E32><U+0E19><U+0E34><U+0E2A><U+0E07><U+0E2A><U+0E4C><U+0E21><U+0E47><U+0E2D><U+0E1A><U+0E01><U+0E39><U+0E49><U+0E0A><U+0E32><U+0E15><U+0E34> "<U+0E2A><U+0E19><U+0E18><U+0E34>" <U+0E1F><U+0E32><U+0E14><U+0E40><U+0E14><U+0E37><U+0E2D><U+0E19><U+0E25><U+0E30> 215 <U+0E25><U+0E49><U+0E32><U+0E19>", 23 March 2006</ref>

=== The Phra Phrom Erawan Shrine incident ===
In the early hours of 21 March 2006, 27-year old Thanakorn Pakdeepol entered the popular Phra Phrom [[Erawan Shrine]] in central Bangkok and attacked the figure of [[Brahma]] with a hammer.  After destroying the statue, he was himself attacked and beaten to death by several people who witnesses it. Thanakorn had a history of mental illness and depression.<ref>[http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/03/22/headlines/headlines_20003314.php Man beaten to death after desecrating the Erawan Shrine<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

On his talk show the following day, Sondhi claimed that Thaksin Shinawatra masterminded the destruction in order to replace the image of Brahma with a "dark force" aligned to Thaksin.<ref>[http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2006/4/2/focus/13836842&sec=focus Dreaded day dawns <U+2013> despite lies and dark forces<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  Sondhi claimed Thaksin that had hired Thanakorn through Khmer (Cambodian) black-magic shamans.<ref>[http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/03/23/politics/politics_20003410.php Vandal's dad distraught<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> 

The vandal's father, Sayant Pakdeepol, denied the accusation and called Sondhi "the biggest liar I have ever seen".  Thaksin called Sondhi's accusations "insane". {{Fact|date=February 2007}}

===The ''Finland Plot''===
Starting in May 2006, Sondhi's [[Manager Daily]] newspaper published a series of articles on an alleged "[[Finland Plot]]", claiming that Thaksin Shinawatra and former leftist student leaders from the 1970s met in Finland in 1999 to create a plan to overthrow the Thai constitutional monarchy and establish a republic.  No evidence was ever produced to support the existence of such a plot, and Thaksin and his [[Thai Rak Thai]] Party firmly denied the accusations.  Thaksin sued Sondhi and several [[Manager Daily]] executives for defamation.  Sondhi countered by saying that Thaksin was trying to silence the press.<ref>The Nation, "Thaksin clearly wanted republic, critics charge", 25 May 2006</ref><ref>The Bangkok Post, [http://www.asiamedia.ucla.edu/article-southeastasia.asp?parentid=46976 "Manager sued for articles on 'Finland plot'"], 31 May 2006</ref>

== Post-2006 Coup ==
Sondhi and other leaders of [[People's Alliance for Democracy]] scheduled a massive demonstration against Thaksin on [[20 September]] [[2006]].  In the days preceding the demonstration, rumours spread that the protest would turn bloody.  However, on [[19 September]] [[2006]], the Thai military, led by General [[Sonthi Boonyaratglin]], overthrew the Thaksin government, dissolved the Parliament, and abrogated the [[1997 Constitution of Thailand|constitution]].  Thaksin, abroad at the time, was exiled indefinitely, and several members of his Cabinet were summoned for investigation.  Sondhi's protest was cancelled, and the PAD later disbanded itself, claiming it was no longer needed.

Sondhi supported the coup, and later went on an international tour through London, Washington DC, and New York to celebrate with the PAD's expatriate supporters.<ref>[http://titan.soas.ac.uk:8080/ramgen/Archive/061007-thaicoup.rm?start=00:18:15&end=02:53:58] Speech by Sondi and Kraisak Chunhawan given at [[School of Oriental and African Studies]], [[University of London]] (in [[rmvb|Real Media format]])</ref>.  During his trip, he also raised funds for the IPO of his satellite business, and explained that he had spent almost 420 million [[baht]] of his own money on the PAD campaign. He later announced that his political focus would be on educating the Thai public on how badly the Thaksin government had run the country.  To accomplish this, Sondhi established the ''Thailand Watch Foundation'' (Yam Fau Paendin Foundation), a non-profit organization that provides financial support to part of his post-Thaksin efforts. He announced that he would end all of his public roles within five years.

Sondhi took a critical stance against the junta when it appointed a few cabinet members who had previously served as civil servants under the Thaksin government.  

He later apologized in court to [[Chaisit Shinawatra]], cousin of Thaksin, for claiming that the Shinawatra and Damapong families had "plundered" the nation, and that all of them were "lower than ****". Chaisit dropped litigation against Sondhi in return for the apology. The court has stated that by accusing a whole family, Sondhi could not be charged, which was an example of Thailand's bizarre legal system.<ref>The Nation, [http://nationmultimedia.com/2007/01/15/headlines/headlines_30024181.php Media tycoon Sonthi apologises to Chaisit], 15 January 2007</ref>

As a rewarded for his support, Sondhi was invited by the [[CDRM|Council for National Security]] (the military junta that overthrew Thaksin's government) to air a political commentary show on government-run Channel 11.<ref>The Nation, [http://nationmultimedia.com/option/print.php?newsid=30027425 Govt must tolerate dissent], 21 February 2007</ref> 

Public protests against the junta began in the months after the coup.  Sondhi and the People's Alliance for Democracy rallied in support of the junta and called for the military to use state-owned news media to "alert" the people to the "evil" of the anti-junta protesters.<ref>The Nation, [http://nationmultimedia.com/2007/07/23/politics/politics_30041903.php Counter rally held against anti-coup group], 23 July 2007</ref>

===2008 political crisis===
As renewed protests by the PAD began against the elected government of Prime Minister Samak Sundaravej, Samak said, "I will never resign in response to these threats.I will not dissolve the House. I will meet the king today to report what's going on." He met with King [[Bhumibol Adulyadej]] at [[Hua Hin]] palace.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7589504.stm  news.bbc.co.uk, Thai PM Samak refuses to resign]</ref> For the 5th day, 30,000 protesters, led by the People's Alliance for Democracy, occupied Sundaravej's Government House compound in central [[Bangkok]], forcing him and his advisers to work out of a military command post. Thai riot police entered the occupied compound and delivered a court order for the eviction of protesters.<ref>[http://www.gulfnews.com/world/Thailand/10241274.html gulfnews.com/world, Thai minister to stay despite protests]</ref> [[Chamlong Srimuang]] ordered 45 PAD guards to break into the main government building on Saturday.<ref>[http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gvt2G9EPA9UPyXWKie_ZyeeIcsig afp.google.com, Thai protesters break into government office as PM heads to consult king]</ref> 3 regional airports remain closed and 35 trains between Bangkok and the provinces were cancelled. Protesters raided the [[Phuket International Airport]] [[tarmac]] on the resort island of [[Phuket Province]] resulting to 118 flights cancelled or diverted, affecting 15,000 passengers.<ref>[http://www.eleconomista.es/mundo/noticias/726786/08/08/I-will-never-resign-says-besieged-Thai-PM.html eleconomista.es, "I will never resign" says besieged Thai PM]</ref>

Protesters also blocked the entrance of the airports in [[Krabi]] and [[Hat Yai]] (which was later re-opened). Police issued [[arrest warrants]] for Sondhi Limthongkul and 8 other protest leaders on charges of [[insurrection]], [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]], [[unlawful assembly]] and refusing orders to disperse.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/30/world/asia/30thai.html?ref=asia nytimes.com, Thai Protest of Premier Stops Trains and Planes]</ref> Meanwhile, Gen. Anupong Paochinda stated: "The army will not stage a coup. The political crisis should be resolved by political means." Samak and the Thai Party ruling coalition called urgent parliamentary debate and session for [[August 31]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7588114.stm  news.bbc.co.uk, Pressure mounts on Thailand's PM]</ref><ref>[http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601080&sid=aGbXEEO82GFM&refer=asia bloomberg.com, Thai Party Calls Urgent Session as Protests Spread]</ref>

== Allegations against the Sarasin family == 
On 27 April 2007, Sondhi claimed on his "Yam Fao Phaendin" (Guard of the Land) TV program that an amendment to the anti-corruption law passed by the National Legislative Assembly had been "stuck" for a month after being submitted for royal endorsement, and suggested the "delay" could be due to family ties between [[Arsa Sarasin]] (King [[Bhumibol]]'s Principal Private Secretary) and [[Pong Sarasin]] (his eldest brother, a major shareholder in a company that Sondhi accused of acting as a nominee in the [[sale of Shin Corporation to Temasek Holdings]]).  

The Office of His Majesty's Principal Private Secretary said in a public statement that Arsa had "has no connections whatsoever" with the issue, and that Sondhi made "incorrect allegations" against the royal secretary. "Sondhi's statement indicated that he failed to double-check the facts and had intended to frame and cause damage to Arsa Sarasin and the Office of His Majesty's Principal Private Secretary," said a letter sent to Sondhi.<ref>The Nation, [http://nationmultimedia.com/2007/05/04/national/national_30033366.php HM's office rebuts Arsa allegations], 4 March 2007</ref>  

Sondhi issued an apology a few days later, but also publicly warned Arsa that he had no right to use the office of the King's Principal Private Secretary to defend himself in a personal matter.  He then accused the King's Principal Private Secretary of speaking with the Attorney General and the Police Commander in order to get charges of lese majeste against Thaksin Shinawatra dropped.<ref><U+0E1C><U+0E39><U+0E49><U+0E08><U+0E31><U+0E14><U+0E01><U+0E32><U+0E23><U+0E2D><U+0E2D><U+0E19><U+0E44><U+0E25><U+0E19><U+0E4C>, [http://www.manager.co.th/Politics/ViewNews.aspx?NewsID=9500000051464 <U+201C><U+0E2A><U+0E19><U+0E18><U+0E34><U+201D> <U+0E40><U+0E15><U+0E37><U+0E2D><U+0E19> <U+201C><U+0E2D><U+0E32><U+0E2A><U+0E32><U+201D> <U+0E2D><U+0E22><U+0E48><U+0E32><U+0E43><U+0E0A><U+0E49><U+0E2A><U+0E33><U+0E19><U+0E31><U+0E01><U+0E23><U+0E32><U+0E0A><U+0E40><U+0E25><U+0E02><U+0E32><U+0E2F> <U+0E42><U+0E22><U+0E07><U+0E40><U+0E23><U+0E37><U+0E48><U+0E2D><U+0E07><U+0E2A><U+0E48><U+0E27><U+0E19><U+0E15><U+0E31><U+0E27>], 4 <U+0E1E><U+0E24><U+0E29><U+0E20><U+0E32><U+0E04><U+0E21> 2550</ref>

==Murder attempt==
Sondhi was reported to have been the target of an assasination attempt on the morning of April 17, 2009. Over 100 rounds were fired at his car as it stopped at a Bangkok petrol station, seriously wounding his driver and injuring Sondhi himself. <ref>'Thai "yellow shirt" leader shot', http://uk.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUKTRE53G02720090417</ref> This was shortly after the end of the violent protest by Red Shirt supporters of Thaksin Shinawatra which had forced the cancellation of the ASEAN summit in [[Pattaya]] and caused days of chaos in the Thai capital city.
