The '''T<U+014D>kai earthquakes''' are major [[earthquake]]s that have occurred regularly with an interval of 100 to 150 years in the [[T<U+014D>kai region]] of [[Japan]]. The Tokai segment has been struck by earthquakes in 1498, 1605, 1707 and 1854.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://geology.about.com/od/eq_prediction/a/aa_tokaiquake.htm|title=The Tokai Earthquake of 20xx|author=Andrew Alden|publisher=[[About.com]]|accessdate=May 19, 2012}}</ref> Given the historic regularity of these earthquakes, [[Kiyoo Mogi]] in 1969 pointed out that another great shallow earthquake was possible in the "near future" (i.e., in the next few decades).<ref name=mogi-2004>{{cite web|url=http://www.terrapub.co.jp/journals/EPS/pdf/2004/5608/5608li.pdf|title=Two grave issues concerning the expected Tokai Earthquake|author=Kiyoo Mogi|journal=Earth Planets Space|volume=56|number=8|pages=li-lxvi|year=2004|accessdate=March 11, 2011}}</ref> [[Shinichi Sakai]] from [[University of Tokyo]] predicted on 23.

Given the magnitude of the last two earthquakes, the next is expected to have at least [[moment magnitude]] (energy) 8, with large areas shaken at the highest level in the [[Japan Meteorological Agency seismic intensity scale|Japanese intensity scale]], 7.<ref>The shaking caused by an earthquake is not the same as, and not totally determined by, the energy released. See [[Seismic scale]], [[Mercalli intensity scale]]</ref>  Emergency planners are anticipating and preparing for potential scenarios after such an earthquake, including the possibility of thousands of deaths and hundreds of thousands of injuries, millions of damaged buildings, and cities that include Nagoya and Shizuoka devastated. Concern has been expressed over the presence of the [[Hamaoka Nuclear Power Plant]], close to the expected epicentre of a Tokai earthquake.<ref name=mogi-2004 /> The [[Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant]] was severely damaged after a large [[2011 T<U+014D>hoku earthquake and tsunami|earthquake followed by a tsunami in 2011]], causing a  [[International Nuclear Event Scale|nuclear event of level 7]], the highest on the scale.

Recently, after the 2011 Sendai Earthquake, new reports came out that it's possible for another magnitude nine earthquake to occur in Japan, this time on the [[Nankai Trough]]. The reports stated that if a magnitude nine earthquake occurred on the Nankai Trough, put simply, it would be very bad. The quake itself would likely kill thousands, and a series of 34-meter (112-foot) tall tsunamis would impact areas from the [[Kanto Region]] to [[Kyushu]], adding thousands to the death toll, and destroying [[Shizuoka]], [[Shikoku]], and other areas with large populations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rt.com/news/megaquake-tsunami-japan-disaster-938/|title=34-meter tsunami may hit Japan after megaquake <U+2013> report|author=Kim Kyung-Hoon|date=April 1, 2012|publisher=[[RT (TV network)|RT]]|accessdate=May 19, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/01/japan-tsunami-earthquake_n_1394593.html|title=Japan Tsunami Could Happen Again If Powerful Earthquake Hits: Experts|date=April 1, 2012|author=Elaine Kurtenbach|newspaper=[[The Huffington Post]]|accessdate=May 19, 2012}}</ref>

==Earthquake prediction==
The Japanese government is taking the T<U+014D>kai earthquakes seriously and has charged the [[Japan Meteorological Agency]] with predicting the next one. There is now a dense array of instruments placed to accumulate a continuous stream of data related to seismicity, strain, crustal expansion, tilt, tidal variations, ground water fluctuations and other variables. They are watching for an anomaly in this data which might precede the next major Tokai earthquake.

Following the prediction of an earthquake in the relatively near future, and in order to try to predict when it would occur, the [[Coordinating Committee for Earthquake Prediction]] (CCEP) designated the Tokai region as an Area of Specific Observation in 1970, and upgraded it to an Area of Intensified Observation in 1974.<ref name=mogi-2004 /> Following the passing of the [[Large-Scale Earthquake Countermeasure Act]] in 1978, the [[Earthquake Assessment Committee]] (EAC) was set up to warn the Prime Minister, via the Japan Meteorological Agency, if the next quake is imminent.<ref name=mogi-2004 />

==Relation to other major earthquakes==
[[File:RuptureAreasNankaiMegathrust.png|thumb|240px|Nankai, Tonankai and Tokai earthquake areas]]
The pattern of historical seismicity reveals that the megathrust surface is segmented, with five separate zones of rupturing identified, conventionally labeled A&ndash;E, from west to east.<ref name="Hirahara">{{cite web|url=http://www.jamstec.go.jp/esc/publication/annual/annual2004/pdf/3project/chapter2/6hirahara.pdf|title=Simulation of Earthquake Generation Process in a Complex System of Faults|last=Hirahara|first=K.|coauthors=Kato N., Miyatake T., Hori T., Hyodo M., Inn J., Mitsui N., Sasaki T., Miyamura T., Nakama Y. & Kanai T.|year=2004|work=Annual Report of the Earth Simulator Center April 2004 - March 2005|pages=121<U+2013>126|accessdate=2009-11-14}}</ref> Earthquakes involving the A+B segments are generally referred to as [[Nankai earthquakes|Nankai]] (literally ''South Sea'') earthquakes, C+D [[Tonankai earthquakes|Tonankai]] (literally ''Southeast Sea'') earthquakes and E Tokai (literally ''East Sea'') earthquakes. These earthquakes repeat at intervals generally in the range of 90 &ndash; 200 years.

On all but one occasion, rupture of segment C (<U+00B1><U+00AD>D <U+00B1>E) has been followed by rupture of segments A+B within a few years. This behavior has been reproduced by modeling the viscoelastic response of the megathrust fault plane with lateral variations in both convergence rate and frictional properties.<ref name="Hirahara"/>
