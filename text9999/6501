After his playing career, Millen was [[President]] and [[chief executive officer|CEO]] of the [[Detroit Lions]] from 2000 until 2008.  His eight-year tenure as head of the franchise led to the worst eight-year record in the history of the modern NFL (31-97), and resulted in his termination on September 24, 2008.

Following his NFL career, he was a football commentator for several national television and radio networks.  His last job before joining the Lions was as a member of the number two broadcast team for the [[NFL on Fox]],<ref>[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4196/is_19981130/ai_n10470074 Fox's No. 2 announcing team proving itself to be first-rate] The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.</ref> as well as being the color commentator for [[Monday Night Football]] on [[NFL on Westwood One|Westwood One]].

==Biography==
===High school and college football===
Millen was born in [[Hokendauqua, Pennsylvania|Hokendauqua]],  [[Pennsylvania]] and grew up in [[Whitehall Township, Pennsylvania|Whitehall]]. He attended [[Whitehall High School (Pennsylvania)|Whitehall High School]] in [[Pennsylvania]]'s [[Lehigh Valley]] region.  He was a standout high school football player for Whitehall, which played in the highly competitive East Penn Conference (now known as the [[Lehigh Valley Conference]]).
He was recruited out of Whitehall High School by [[Pennsylvania State University]], where he became an [[All-American]] [[defensive tackle]] for the [[Penn State Nittany Lions football|Nittany Lions]].

===NFL career===
Following his career at Penn State, Millen entered the [[1980 NFL Draft]] and was selected by the [[Oakland Raiders]] with the draft's 43rd overall selection in the second round.

During his 12-year NFL playing career, Millen played for the Raiders, the [[San Francisco 49ers]], and the [[Washington Redskins]]. He won a Super Bowl with each of these teams, including two with the Raiders (one when the team was based in [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] and one during their stint in [[Los Angeles]]). He won one Super Bowl each with the 49ers and Redskins, though he was de-activated for [[Super Bowl XXVI]] while with the Redskins.<ref>[http://www.nfluk.com/features-display.php?id=1923 Halling's Hall of Fame] NFLUK.com.</ref>

During his NFL career, he was selected to play in one [[Pro Bowl]] (in [[1988 NFL season|1988]]).  Millen finished his 12 NFL seasons with 11 sacks and 9 interceptions, which he returned for 132 yards, and 8 fumble recoveries. He also returned 7 kickoffs for 72 yards.

===Television and radio career===
Following his professional football career, Millen worked as a [[color commentator]] for [[NFL on CBS|CBS]] [[television|TV]] (which teamed him with [[Sean McDonough]], Paul Olden, [[Mike Emrick]], and [[Tim Ryan (sportscaster)|Tim Ryan]]), and for [[NFL on Fox|Fox]] (which teamed him with [[Dick Stockton]]). He also provided game analysis for the radio broadcasts of [[Monday Night Football]], working alongside [[Howard David]] on [[CBS]]'s [[NFL on Westwood One|Westwood One]] radio network.

At Fox, Millen came to be considered the number-two analyst for its nationally-broadcast games, behind [[John Madden (American football)|John Madden]] (who had been successfully teaming for years with [[Pat Summerall]]).

Millen returned to broadcasting when he served as a studio analyst for [[Football Night in America|NBC's]] coverage of Wild Card Saturday,<ref>[http://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/blog/shutdown_corner/post/Matt-Millen-finds-himself-busy-on-a-Playoff-Satu?urn=nfl,132004 Matt Millen finds himself busy on a Playoff Saturday - Yahoo! Sports]</ref> his first television appearance in an analyst role since the 2000 NFC Divisional Playoffs, and reprised that role for NBC on their coverage of [[Super Bowl XLIII]].

On June 15, 2009 Millen was named the lead analyst for the [[NFL Network|NFL Network's]] [[Run to the Playoffs|Thursday Night Football telecast]], replacing [[Cris Collinsworth]].<ref>[http://www.nfl.com/nflnetwork/story?id=09000d5d810d51ce&template=without-video-with-comments&confirm=true Millen named analyst for NFL Network's Thursday Night Football]</ref>  He is also the color analyst for ESPN College Football with Sean McDonough and Holly Rowe.

===Detroit Lions management===
In [[2001 NFL season|2001]], Millen left broadcasting to assume the job of the [[Detroit Lions]]' CEO and ''de facto'' [[general manager]]. At that time, Millen had no prior player development or front office experience.

Millen was the Lions' CEO for seven full seasons, from 2001-07; during that time, the club compiled a record of 31-81 (with at least nine losses each season). Detroit's .277 winning percentage was the among the worst ever compiled by an NFL team over a seven-year period; only the [[Chicago Cardinals]] of 1939-45 (10-61-3, .141) and the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] of 1983-89 (26-86, .234) were less successful. 

During the early part of Millen's tenure (2001&ndash;2003), the Lions failed to win a road game for three years (0&ndash;24) before opening the season with a win at the [[2004 Chicago Bears season|Chicago Bears]] in 2004. Overall, the Lions are 8&ndash;50 on the road since 2001.<ref>Source: Profootballreference.com</ref>  Millen himself admitted to an interviewer in 2008 that the team's record under his leadership has been "beyond awful".<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3259255 ESPN.com article "Millen sympathizes with fans; has confidence in Marinelli, future". Retrieved February 22, 2008.]</ref>  The [[Wall Street Journal]] said that NFL executives admit in private that Millen "has made more bad draft decisions than anyone else in two centuries".<ref>{{cite news| url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB120915476422645617.html | work=The Wall Street Journal | title=The Sleeping Lion | first=Allen | last=Barra | date=April 26, 2008}}</ref>

Despite the team's record on the field, Matt Millen was the second-highest paid general manager in the NFL.<ref>[http://www.signonsandiego.com/sports/chargers/20080102-9999-1s2smith.html] Sign On San Diego.</ref>  With a draft record that included a number of high first-round draft picks who were considered poor choices ([[Charles Rogers (American football)|Charles Rogers]], [[Joey Harrington]], and [[Mike Williams (wide receiver)|Mike Williams]] among them),<ref>[http://www.boston.com/sports/football/patriots/articles/2006/12/02/lions_share_of_blame_goes_to_millen/ Lion's share of blame goes to Millen - The Boston Globe]</ref> and widespread disappointment among fans, the media, and even some players, Millen received a five-year contract extension from owner [[William Clay Ford, Sr.]] at the start of the [[2005 NFL season|2005]] season.<ref>[http://www.detroitlions.com/document_display.cfm?document_id=426876 President CEO Matt Millen Signs Five-Year Contract Extension] DetroitLions.com.</ref> Following the team's 3&ndash;13 performance in 2006, Ford announced that Millen would be retained as General Manager for at least another season, because according to inside sources to the Ford family, they still believed that Millen is the best GM that the Lions ever had.<ref>[http://www.detnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070103/SPORTS0101/701030394&SearchID=73268180347664 Lions' Millen: 'I'll never quit'] The Detroit News.</ref>
On September 24, 2008, Millen was confirmed to no longer hold his positions with the Lions. Whether he was dismissed or resigned was unclear.<ref>[http://msn.foxsports.com/nfl/story/8601458/Millen-out-as-Lions-president,-GM Millen out as Lions president, GM] Fox Sports.</ref> It was later reported by a team official that Millen was actually fired.<ref>[http://www.mlive.com/lions/index.ssf/2008/09/its_confirmed_the_lions_have_f.html It's confirmed -- the Lions have fired Millen]</ref>

With the Detroit Lions trade of 2006 First Round draft pick Ernie Sims in April 2010, only four of Matt Millen's first round draft picks (receiver Calvin Johnson (the fourth WR chosen by Detroit #1 overall during Millen's reign) Left Tackle Jeff Backus, Center Dominic Raiola and Gosder Cherilus remained on the team's roster.  

====Competition committee====
Millen was named to the [[NFL competition committee]] on August 4, 2006.<ref name="prodigy">[http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2539393 Lions' Millen named to NFL's competition committee], espn.com. Retrieved August 4, 2006.</ref>

===="Fire Millen" movement====
[[Image:LionsFans.jpg|thumb|right|440px| Angry Detroit Lions fans organizing a "Fire Millen" protest in 2005.]]

The chant began to spread during a college basketball game between Michigan State and [[Wichita State University|Wichita State]] at [[The Palace of Auburn Hills]] on December 10, 2005. It started when ousted Lions [[head coach|coach]] [[Steve Mariucci]] was shown on the big screen, prompting a standing ovation for Mariucci and a loud chant of "Fire Millen!" The following night in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], in an NBA game between the [[Detroit Pistons]] and [[Los Angeles Clippers]], the chant surfaced late in the 4th quarter at the [[Staples Center]]. The chant has also been heard during various [[Detroit Red Wings]] games, both home and away, as well as during a college basketball game between Michigan and [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]]. Former Pistons [[power forward (basketball)|power forward]] [[Rasheed Wallace]] even took part in the chant during a late timeout in a December 16, [[2005-06 NBA season|2005]] game against the [[Chicago Bulls]]. A "Fire Millen" sign was shown in the background of a February 3, 2007 broadcast of [[ESPN]] ''College Gameday'' at the [[University of Kansas]].  One large sign with the "Fire Millen" slogan was removed by NCAA officials at the football national championship in [[Florence, Alabama]].

"Fire Millen" even turned up in a background sign in the sports-oriented [[comic strip]] [[Gil Thorp]]<ref>[http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/custom/gilthorp/cs-060220gilthorpgallery,0,3603766.cartoongallery Week of February 20, 2006] The Official Gil Thorpe Website.</ref> on February 20, 2006 ('''[[Detroit News]]'' 'columnist [[Neal Rubin]] took over as the writer of ''Gil Thorp'' in 2004).
[[Image:Keepmillen.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Rival [[Green Bay Packers|Green Bay]] fans insisting the Lions "Keep Millen."]]
The "Fire Millen" chant returned in force to Ford Field during the second half of the 2006 [[Thanksgiving]] day game between the Detroit Lions and the [[Miami Dolphins]],<ref>[http://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/recap;_ylt=Am7beiAeKWc0RkHlv1wBhCKF2bYF?gid=20061123008&prov=ap Miami 27, Detroit 10] Yahoo! Sports.</ref> when former Lions quarterback and first round pick [[Joey Harrington]] (often a [[scapegoat]] for the Lions problems) led the Dolphins to a 27-10 hammering of Detroit, dropping the Lions' record to 2-9. More Fire Millen chants have been heard at wrestling event [[World Wrestling Entertainment|WWE]]'s [[WrestleMania 23]] held at Ford Field, and [[TNA]]'s [[Bound for Glory]].  For 2008 The Fire Millen chants were back in force during the game against the Green Bay Packers.

====Other protests====
On December 6, 2005, Detroit sports talk radio station [[WDFN]] announced the "Angry Fan March" (also known as the "Millen Man March") in protest of Millen's contract extension.<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2264484 Fans take aim again at Lions GM Millen] ESPN.com.</ref>

On December 9, 2005, in protest of Millen's poor record, one Detroit Lions fan site, known as "The Lions Fanatics," led by owner Dan Spanos organized an "orange out" event, which encouraged Lions fans to show up at Detroit's [[Ford Field]] clad in hunter's [[orange (color)|orange]],<ref>[http://www.thelionsfanatics.com/insider_news_178.html Asking For Your Support] The Lions Fanatics.</ref> the color of their opponent that week, the Cincinnati Bengals. 

In a game against Chicago on December 24, 2006 another group of fans, led by Herbert Nicholl Jr., planned a walkout protest towards the end of the first half to express their disgust with the current management.<ref>[http://www.aolsportsblog.com/2006/12/06/lions-fans-are-mobilizing-their-hatred-of-matt-millen/ Lions Fans are Mobilizing Their Hatred of Matt Millen] AOL Sports.</ref>

====Terminated from the Lions====
After a 0-3 start to the Lions 2008 season, Lions vice chairman and [[Ford Motor Company]] Executive Chairman [[William Clay Ford, Jr.]], told reporters on September 22, 2008 if it were up to him, he would fire Millen.<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3603062 Ford Jr. says if he was in charge of father's Lions, he'd fire Millen - ESPN.com]</ref> Despite this, the elder Ford claimed he had no plans to dismiss Millen.

With the Detroit Lions trade of 2006 First Round draft pick [[Ernie Sims]] in April 2010, only four of Matt Millen's first round draft picks, receiver [[Calvin Johnson]] (the fourth WR chosen by Detroit #1 overall during Millen's reign), Left Tackle [[Jeff Backus]], Center Dominic Raiola and [[Gosder Cherilus]] remained on the team's roster.

However, on September 24, 2008 Matt Millen's tenure as team president and general manager ended.<ref>[http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080924/SPORTS01/80924031 Sipple, George, "Ford fires Millen, says fans 'deserve a winner'", ''[[Detroit Free Press]]'', September 24, 2008]</ref> Lions owner William Clay Ford later announced that Millen had been relieved of his duties as Lions General Manager and Team President.

=====Millen takes responsibility=====
On the January 3, 2009 edition of NBC's ''[[Football Night in America]]'', Millen admitted his role in the team's downfall, saying he would have fired himself after the 2008 season.<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3808086 Millen says Lions' downfall his fault.]</ref> During NBC's pre-game show for [[Super Bowl XLIII]], Detroit's affiliate [[WDIV-TV]] ran a ticker on their website, asking viewers to question his credibility as an NBC Sports panelist, given his past with the Lions.<ref name="warning-mattmillen">{{cite web|url=http://www.freep.com/article/20090202/SPORTS01/902020356/1049/SPORTS01/Warning++Matt+Millen+s+on+|title=Warning!

==Controversies==

===Devout coward comments===
In October 2002, Millen came under fire for calling an unidentified defensive player a "devout coward" on [[Mike Ditka]]'s Chicago radio show, following a Lions 23&ndash;20 overtime win over the [[2002 Chicago Bears season|Chicago Bears]].  Millen apologized for the comments, with Lions owner [[William Clay Ford, Sr.]] expressing his disappointment over Millen's comments.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://assets.espn.go.com/nfl/news/2002/1020/1448619.html |title=ESPN.com: NFL - Millen apologizes for 'devout coward' comment |publisher=Assets.espn.go.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-05}}</ref>

===Johnnie Morton incident===
In December 2003, following a Lions 45&ndash;17 loss to the [[2003 Kansas City Chiefs season|Kansas City Chiefs]] at [[Arrowhead Stadium]], Millen once again came under fire, after a postgame incident with former Lions and then-Chiefs wide receiver [[Johnnie Morton]].  Millen tried to congratulate some of the Chiefs players near the Chiefs locker room, when he confronted Morton, who claimed that he wasn't going to say anything to Millen.  When he walked by him, Millen said "Hey Johnnie", Morton ignored him, and then Millen replied "Nice talking to you", and Morton replied "Kiss my ass."  That's when Millen shouted "You faggot! Yeah, you heard me. You faggot!" at Morton, which was heard by a member of the Chiefs public-relations staff and a ''[[Kansas City Star]]'' columnist.  Millen apologized for the incident, and after he was informed of Millen's remarks, Morton replied "I apologize for what I said, but I never expected anything like that. What he said is demeaning and bigoted. [[Jeremy Shockey]] got in trouble for saying it about a coach ([[Bill Parcells]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.outsports.com/columns/page/20030809shockey.htm |title=Jeremy Shockey Should Learn to Shut Up |publisher=Outsports.com |date=2003-08-09 |accessdate=2010-06-05}}</ref> and now we have a president of a team making statements like that. It's totally unacceptable. I have gay friends, and I don't even joke around with them like that."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.outsports.com/nfl/2003/1216millenmorton.htm |title=NFL Exec Calls Player "Faggot" |publisher=Outsports.com |date=2003-12-15 |accessdate=2010-06-05}}</ref>  There had been bad blood between the two since Morton was released by the Lions after the 2001 season, and Morton felt like Millen "tossed him aside."

===Ethnic slur at 2010 NFL Draft===
On April 24, 2010, at the [[2010 NFL Draft]], Millen apparently referred to fellow [[ESPN]] commentator [[Ron Jaworski]] as a "[[Polack]]", after which he made an on-air apology, stating that he "didn't mean anything" by the remark.<ref>[http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2010/04/24/matt-millen-apologizes-for-calling-jaws-a-polack/ Matt Millen apologizes for calling Jaws a "Polack"]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beatweek.com/blog/4868-matt-millen-apologizes-to-ron-jaworski/ |title=Matt Millen apologizes to Ron Jaworski : Beatweek Magazine |publisher=Beatweek.com |date=2010-04-24 |accessdate=2010-06-05}}</ref>

==Millen in parodies==
A target of many jokes among those in the football circles, among one of the more notable examples is that of [[Bang Cartoons]], who depict Millen as a gorilla-like oaf with a child-like mentality.  He's usually accompanied by a young, mentally challenged sidekick named Billy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bangcartoon.com/2006/lionshare.htm |title=BANG CARTOONS: Hilarious NFL cartoons and podcasts! |publisher=Bangcartoon.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-05}}</ref>
