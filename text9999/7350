The '''Morgan dollar''' was a [[United States dollar coin]] minted intermittently from 1878 to 1921. It was the first standard silver dollar minted since production of that denomination ceased due to the passage of the [[Coinage Act of 1873|Fourth Coinage Act]], an act which also ended the [[Free silver|free coining of silver]]. The coin is named for its designer, [[United States Mint]] Assistant Engraver [[George T. Morgan]]. The [[Obverse and reverse|obverse]] depicts a profile portrait representing [[Libertas|Liberty]], while the reverse depicts an eagle with wings outstretched. 

The dollar was authorized by the [[Bland<U+2013>Allison Act]]. Following the passage of the Fourth Coinage Act, mining interests lobbied to restore the free coinage. Instead, the Bland<U+2013>Allison Act was passed, which required the Treasury to purchase between two and four million dollars worth of silver at market value to be coined into dollars each month. In 1890, the Bland<U+2013>Allison Act was repealed by the [[Sherman Silver Purchase Act]], which required the Treasury to purchase {{convert|4,500,000|ozt|kg}} of silver each month, but only required further silver dollar production for one year. This act, in turn, was repealed in 1893. 

In 1898, Congress approved a bill that required all remaining bullion purchased under the Sherman Silver Purchase Act to be coined into silver dollars. When in 1904,  those silver reserves were depleted, the Mint ceased to strike the Morgan dollar. The [[Pittman Act]], passed in 1918, authorized the melting and recoining of millions of silver dollars. Pursuant to the act, Morgan dollars resumed mintage for one year in 1921. The design was replaced by the [[Peace dollar]] later the same year.

In the early 1960s, a large quantity of uncirculated Morgan dollars was found to be available from Treasury vaults, including issues once thought rare. Individuals began purchasing large quantities of the pieces at face value, and eventually the Treasury ceased to exchange [[silver certificate]]s for silver coin. Beginning in the 1970s, the Treasury conducted a sale of silver dollars minted at the [[Carson City Mint]] through the [[General Services Administration]]. In 2006, Morgan's reverse design was used on a silver dollar issued to [[commemorative coin|commemorate]] the old [[San Francisco Mint]] building.

== Background ==
In 1873, [[United States Congress|Congress]] enacted the [[Coinage Act of 1873|Fourth Coinage Act]],<ref name="coinage1873">Van Allen & Mallis, p. 21</ref> which effectively ended the [[Bimetallism|bimetallic standard]] in the United States by demonetizing silver bullion.<ref name="gbooks1">Fite, p. 428</ref> Prior to enactment of the Coinage Act, silver could be brought to the mints and coined into legal tender for a small fee.<ref name="silverfee">Fite, p. 429</ref> With such a system in place, bullion producers could have silver coined into dollars when the intrinsic value of a silver dollar was lower than the face value, thus making a profit, flooding the money supply and causing inflation.<ref name="vam1"/> The act ended production of the standard silver dollar (then the [[Seated Liberty dollar]], as designed by [[Christian Gobrecht]]) and provided for mintage of a silver [[Trade Dollar (United States coin)|trade dollar]], which was intended to compete with Mexican dollars for use in the [[Orient]].<ref name="vam1">Van Allen & Mallis, p. 23</ref> Under the act, bullion producers were allowed to bring bullion to the mints in order to be cast into bars or coined into the newly authorized trade dollars for a [[Seigniorage|small fee]].<ref name="vam1"/> Trade dollars initially held legal tender status, but it was revoked in 1876 to prevent bullion producers from making a profit by coining silver into trade dollars when the value of the metal was low.<ref>Yeoman, p. 18</ref> The restrictions on free coinage laid out in the Coinage Act initially met little resistance from mining interests until the price of silver declined rapidly due to increased mining in the [[Western United States]].<ref name="gbooks1"/> Protests also came from bankers, manufacturers and farmers, who felt an increased money supply would have a positive impact. Groups were formed that demanded the free coinage of silver (or "[[Free Silver]]") in order to inflate the  dollar following the [[Panic of 1873]].<ref name="vam2">Van Allen & Mallis, p. 24</ref>

In 1876, Director of the Mint [[Henry Linderman|Henry Richard Linderman]] began efforts to redesign the nation's silver coins.<ref name="morgan1">Van Allen & Mallis, p. 73</ref> Linderman contacted C.W. Fremantle, Deputy Master of the [[Royal Mint]] in London, requesting him to "find a first class die-sinker who would be willing to take the position of Assistant Engraver at the [[Philadelphia Mint|Mint at Philadelphia]]."<ref name="morgan1"/> In response to Linderman's request, Fremantle wrote "My inquiries as to an Assistant Engraver lead me very strongly to recommend for the post [[George T. Morgan|Mr. George Morgan]], age 30, who has made himself a considerable name, but for whom there is not much opening at present in this country."<ref name="morgan1"/> An agreement was reached between Linderman and Morgan  for the engraver to work at the Philadelphia Mint under Chief Engraver [[William Barber (engraver)|William Barber]] on a six-month trial basis.<ref name="morgan1"/>

[[File:AnnaWillessWilliams.JPG|thumb|left|150px|Anna Willess Williams, pictured here in 1922, sat for George T. Morgan five times as a model for his design.]]

Morgan arrived in Philadelphia on October 9, 1876.<ref name="morgan1"/> His earliest [[pattern coin]]s designed during his tenure at the Philadelphia Mint were intended for the [[Half dollar (United States coin)|half dollar]].<ref name="morgan2">Van Allen & Mallis, p. 74</ref> In 1876, Morgan enrolled as a student at the [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]] to prepare to create a new [[Libertas|Liberty]] head design.<ref name="morgan3">Van Allen & Mallis, p. 75</ref> Morgan also obtained studies from nature of the bald eagle for preparation of the reverse design.<ref name="morgan3"/> For the representation of Liberty, Morgan sought to depict an American woman rather than the usual Greek<U+2013>style figures.<ref name="morgan3"/> Morgan's friend, artist [[Thomas Eakins]], suggested he use [[Anna Willess Williams]] of Philadelphia as a model.<ref name="morgan3"/> In total, Morgan had five sittings with Williams; he declared her profile to be the most perfect he had seen.<ref name="morgan3"/>

On October 18, 1877, Linderman requested Superintendent of the Philadelphia Mint [[James Pollock]] to "instruct Mr. Morgan to prepare without delay, dies for a silver dollar, the designs, inscriptions, and arrangement thereof to be the same as the enclosed impression for the Half Dollar and numbered '2' substituting the words 'one dollar' in place of 'half dollar'". Linderman also ordered Pollock to "instruct Mr. Barber to prepare a reverse die for a dollar with a representation of an eagle as well as the inscriptions required by law. He will select whichever of his Heads of Liberty he prefers for the obverse of the same."<ref>Van Allen & Mallis, p. 79</ref> Linderman evidently preferred the designs of Morgan over those of the Chief Engraver; he wrote Pollock on February 21, 1878, "I have now to state for your information, that it is my intention, in the event of the silver bill now pending in Congress, becoming law, to request the approval by the Secretary of the Treasury, of the dies prepared by Mr. Morgan."<ref>Van Allen & Mallis, p. 83</ref>

== Production ==

[[File:Philadelphia, Mint coining press, from Robert N. Dennis collection of stereoscopic views.png|thumb|right|300px|A coinage press at the Philadelphia Mint]]
Production of the coins did not commence until March&nbsp;11, more than a week after the passage of the Bland<U+2013>Allison Act.<ref name="coin1">Van Allen & Mallis, p. 84</ref> The first acceptable strike, after adjustments to the press, was coined at 3:17&nbsp;p.m. at the [[Philadelphia Mint#Second Building (1833-1901)|Philadelphia Mint]].<ref name="coin1"/> This piece was given to President Hayes; the second and third were given to Secretary of the Treasury [[John Sherman (Ohio)|John Sherman]] and to Mint Director Henry Linderman.<ref name="coin1"/> 

Linderman desired to involve the western mints of [[San Francisco Mint|San Francisco]] and [[Carson City Mint|Carson City]] in production in order to help reach the monthly quota necessary under the Bland<U+2013>Allison Act.<ref>Van Allen & Mallis, p. 86</ref> Pressure was so great at the Philadelphia Mint that it halted production of all other coins and began operating overtime.<ref name="mint1">Van Allen & Mallis, p. 88</ref> Use of the western mints was delayed, however, as all dies were prepared at the Philadelphia Mint, and it was believed that the Western mints did not have the proper equipment to prepare the dies for use.<ref name="mint2">Van Allen & Mallis, p. 87</ref> During the second week of production, Linderman pointed out what he called a "slight imperfection" in the dies for the dollar.<ref name="mint2"/> The reason for the changes was to reduce the relief of the designs and to change the number of tail feathers on the eagle from eight to seven; this was done because all prior United States coinage depicted the bald eagle as having an odd number of tail feathers.<ref name="mint2"/> The high relief had caused the dies to have a shorter life.<ref name="mint1"/> Dies were eventually sent to the Western mints, arriving in both San Francisco and Carson City on April 16, 1878.<ref>Van Allen & Mallis, p. 90</ref> The [[New Orleans Mint]] began striking the new silver dollars in 1879.<ref>Yeoman, p. 219</ref> 

The [[Denver Mint]], established in 1906, struck the coins for only one year, in 1921.<ref name="rb">Yeoman, p. 221</ref> The [[mint mark]]s appearing on the coins are none, representing Philadelphia, "<small>CC</small>" for Carson City, "<small>S</small>" for San Francisco, "<small>O</small>" for New Orleans and "<small>D</small>" for Denver.<ref name="rb"/> In order to conform to the Coinage Act of&nbsp;1837, the Morgan dollar contained ninety percent silver and ten percent copper, measured {{convert|38.1|mm|in|}} in diameter and weighed {{convert|412.5|gr|g}}.<ref>Yeoman, p. 218</ref>

Mintage of the Morgan dollar remained relatively steady until the passage of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act on July 14, 1890.<ref name="sherman1">Yeoman, p. 220</ref> The act, authored by Ohio senator and former Treasury secretary John Sherman, forced the Treasury to increase the amount of silver purchased to {{convert|4,500,000|ozt|kg}} each month.<ref>Fite, p. 446</ref> Supporters of the act believed that an increase in the amount of silver purchased would result in inflation, helping to relieve the nation's farmers.<ref name="silverpurchaseact">Van Allen & Mallis, p. 27</ref> The act also received support from mining interests because such large purchases would cause the price of silver to rise and increase their profits.<ref name="silverpurchaseact"/> Despite the fact that the purchase of silver was required by the act, it stated that the Mint must coin 2,000,000 silver dollars each month only until 1891.<ref name="sherman2">Van Allen & Mallis, p. 29</ref> Since the Treasury already had a surplus of silver dollars, mintages dropped sharply beginning in 1892.<ref name="sherman1"/> The silver that remained after mintage of the dollars was used to mint dimes, quarters and half dollars.<ref name="sherman1"/>

Beginning early in 1893, a number of industrial firms, including the [[Philadelphia and Reading Railroad]] and the [[National Cordage Company]] went bankrupt.<ref name="banks">{{cite journal

In 1918, Democratic senator [[Key Pittman]] of Nevada introduced legislation that was largely meant as relief for the [[United Kingdom|British]] government during World War I.<ref name="pittman2">Van Allen & Mallis, p. 31</ref> The bill, passed on April 22, 1918, states that "sales of silver bullion under authority of this act may be made for the purpose of conserving the existing stock of gold in the United States, of providing silver for subsidiary coinage and for commercial use, and of assisting foreign governments at war with the enemies of the United States."<ref name="pittman2"/> The reason for the United Kingdom's need was a propaganda campaign of the [[Germany|German]] government.<ref name="pittman1"/> The Germans convinced residents of [[India]] that the banknotes issued by the British government could not be redeemed for silver, which caused a run on the British supply of the metal.<ref name="pittman1"/> The [[Pittman Act]] authorized the melting of up to 350,000,000 silver dollars.<ref name="pittman2"/> The melting of the silver dollars began immediately after the passage of the act.<ref name="pittman2"/> A total of 270,232,722&nbsp;silver dollars were eventually melted.<ref name="pittman2"/> 259,121,554&nbsp;of the melted dollars were sold to the United Kingdom at the cost of one dollar per troy ounce.<ref name="pittman2"/> Another provision of the Pittman Act authorized the coinage of a replacement for every silver dollar melted.<ref name="pittman3">Van Allen & Mallis, p. 32</ref> Mintage of the Morgan dollar resumed for only one year, 1921.<ref name="pittman3"/> Since all obsolete coinage dies had been destroyed in 1910, Morgan was forced to create an entirely new master die for the dollar.<ref>Van Allen & Mallis, p. 95</ref> 1921 also marked the first issuance of the [[Peace dollar]], as a coin to commemorate the resulting peace after [[World War I]].<ref name="peace">Yeoman, p. 222</ref> This replacement of the Morgan dollar was issued under the terms of the Pittman Act without congressional authorization, despite the fact that the act makes no mention of the design of the coins.<ref name="peace"/> The change in design was actually authorized under an 1890 act of Congress,<ref>Van Allen & Mallis, p. 409</ref> which stated:
