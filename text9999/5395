'''Thorkell the Tall''', also known as '''Thorkell the High''' in the Anglo-Saxon chronicles ([[Old Norse language|Old Norse]]: '''<U+00DE>orkell inn h<U+00E1>vi'''; [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]: Torkjell H<U+00F8>ge; [[Swedish language|Swedish]]; Torkel den H<U+00F6>ge: [[Danish language|Danish]]: Torkild den H<U+00F8>je) was a [[Jomsviking]], a son of the [[Sk<U+00E5>ne|Scanian]] chieftain [[Strut-Harald]], a brother of [[Jarl]] [[Sigvald Jarl|Sigvaldi]], commander of the Jomvikings and the legendary stronghold, mythical [[Jomsborg]], on the Island of [[Wollin]], while himself a notable lord.

He took part in the [[Battle of Hj<U+00F6>rungav<U+00E1>gr]] in [[986]] and in the [[Battle of Swold]] in [[1000]]. In [[1009]], he attacked [[England]] with a large army, eventually payed an unusually large [[Danegeld]], in [[1011]]. 

In [[1012]], he and his men entered into the service of king [[Ethelred the Unready]], whom they fought under in [[1013]] against the invasion of king [[Sweyn Forkbeard]] and his son [[Canute the Great|Cnut]]. After the death of Swegen, and the English attacks on the Danish invaders which drove his son to abandon the conquest, Ethelred's forces were turned against the Jomsvikings in his service. Thorkells brother Henning was killed<ref>Trow, M.J., ''Cnut: Emperor of the North'', first. edn., Sutton (2005), pg. 57</ref>, and he went back to Denmark, with a score to settle in England. He was to return with the to be king, in [[1015]], and the invasion's success meant he was proclaimed to be the [[Jarl]] of [[East Anglia]], in [[1017]], after the coronation of the Viking king of England. An explanation for Cnut the Great's acceptance of Thorkell's allegiance, not to mention his military prowess, may be that he was in fact his childhood mentor<ref>Trow, M.J., Cnut: Emperor of the North, first edn., Sutton (2005), pg. 44</ref>, and the Jomsvikings also of special worth to Cnut. He himself held a score against the men responsible for the betrayal of oaths of allegiance given by the English nobles after his father Forkbeard's conquest. If it was Thurkil's men who taught Cnut to fight his battles, such bonds as these were surely hard broken, even with opposition in war. 

In [[1021]], though, Jarl Thurkil fell out with king Canute <ref>Lawson, M.K., ''Cnut: England's Viking King'', rev. edn., Tempus (2005), pg. 90</ref>, and had to make himself scarce and went to Denmark. He was soon reconciled with Canute again, who proclaimed him Jarl once more, of Denmark, although he seems to disappear, in [[1023]], as there is no mention of him after this point<ref>Lawson, M.K., ''Cnut: England's Viking King'', rev. edn., Tempus (2005), pg. 92</ref>. It may be he was simply too old for anymore conflict, and the final years of his life spent at court, yet with no military commands. It may also be that he was cast out of the kingdom, to return to Jomsborg, or Scane, and lived the rest of his days as a wayward old soldier. Equally, he might have been dead soon after he was made Jarl of Denmark, and the causes entirely natural, or malevolent. We will never know, unless his final fate is written in some hidden manuscript, which now gathers dust in a cellar along with a wealth of lost medieval texts on the extremely difficult and dark Viking age.

While we are sure Thorkell is undoubtedly a real historical figure his career, especially its early part, is steeped in legendary associations with the mysterious Jomsvikings, which too often distract and distort from the facts of his life.
