'''John Elmer "Jack" Stivetts''' (March&nbsp;31, 1868&nbsp;<U+2013> April&nbsp;18, 1930),   was a professional baseball [[pitcher]] who played 11&nbsp;seasons in [[Major League Baseball]]&nbsp;(MLB) spanning from 1889&nbsp;to 1899. He played in the [[American Association (19th century)|American Association]]&nbsp;(AA) with the [[St. Louis Cardinals|St. Louis Browns]], and in the [[National League]]&nbsp;(NL) with the [[Atlanta Braves|Boston Beaneaters]] and [[Cleveland Spiders]]. "Happy Jack" (nicknamed due to his pleasant demeanor} was born to German immigrants and raised in [[Ashland, Pennsylvania]].<ref name=refstivetts>{{cite web|title=Jack Stivetts|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/s/stiveja01.shtml|work=[[Baseball-Reference.com|baseball-reference.com]]|publisher=Sports Reference, LLC|accessdate=April&nbsp;2, 2013}}</ref><ref name="caruso0243">Caruso, pp. 243</ref> He initially followed his father into the coal mining industry before playing professional baseball. After playing two and half seasons in [[minor league baseball]]&nbsp;(MiLB), he was signed to the Browns. Over the next few seasons, he was regarded as one of the best pitchers in baseball. 

In his first season, he led the AA in [[earned run average]]&nbsp;(ERA), and in [[strikeout]]s two seasons later. In the years spanning from 1890&nbsp;through 1896, he posted 20&nbsp;or more victories in a season six times; two of which he won more than 30. In 1892, he won a career-high 35&nbsp;games, and on August&nbsp;6, he threw a [[no-hitter]]. During his seven seasons with the Beaneaters, he was part of four league championships, and pitched along-side future [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Hall of Fame]] members [[John Clarkson]] and [[Kid Nichols]]. He was among the best hitting pitchers of his era, and was often used at other positions when he was not pitching. He became the first pticher to hit two home runs in one game, and his season total of seven in 1890 stood as the record for pitchers until 1931. He compiled a .298&nbsp;lifetime [[batting average]], hit 35&nbsp;[[home run]]s, and delivered 357&nbsp;[[run batted in|runs batted in]]&nbsp;(RBIs).

His last season in the major leagues, he played for the Spiders, widely considered to be one of the worst teams in MLB history. After his baseball career, he returned to his hometown of Ashland. He worked for the area coal mines as a brewery wagon driver and carpenter, and died there at 62 years of age.
