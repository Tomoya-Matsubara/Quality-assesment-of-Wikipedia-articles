'''Boyd McDonald (pornographer)''' 

Boyd McDonald (1925-1993), to which he sometimes prefixed the (self-awarded) title of "Reverend," was born in South Dakota, and entered Harvard as a high-school dropout after serving in the army in World War II. Jobs with Time, IBM, and several Wall Street firms preceded his career as a chronicler of gay sex. After having lost his "straight" jobs, and living on welfare,<ref>Reed Woodhouse, ''Unlimited Embrace: A Canon of Gay Fiction, 1945-1995'', University of Massachusetts Press, 1998, ISBN 1558491325, p. 63</ref> he founded in 1973 and edited until 1992 his long-running [[zine]] S.T.H. or ''Straight to Hell'', and later published a number of anthologies of true sex histories. Boyd died in September 1993, two months after completing his final book, ''Scum''.

Boyd himself always called ''STH'' a work of research and spoke, quite unironically, of its importance to future historians. ''STH'', he claimed, told the story of what people were actually doing in "The Golden Age of Cocksucking (1940-1980)".<ref>Woodhouse, p. 70.</ref> McDonald typically engaged in acerbic political commentary and cultural criticism, especially directed at the hypocrisy of those who are not fully accepting of their own desires, however perverted. Priests who sucked boys were no problem for him; it was the ones that wouldn't suck them that were the problem. He typically titled his contributors' stories to parody news items, so trenchantly that the editor's statement is made even before the author begins to speak: "Baptist Boys Do It, As It Were, In Church"; "Typical 'Straight' Admits Weakness for Friend's Tongue"; "Youth Leaves Damp Underpants for Host to Sniff", "The Love That Dare Not Speak It sName: Armpit-Sniffing."<ref>Bernard Welt, "One Man's Meat", http://denniscooper-theweaklings.blogspot.com/2008/11/billy-miller-christian-siekmeier-and.html?zx=95d9a097b9af8c9c, retrieved 2014-09-10</ref>

"The truth is the biggest turn-on", he wrote, and "the proper study of homosexuality is homosexuals" [sic].<ref>"The Dangerous Country, in ''Meat''.</ref> McDonald said that his mission was to replace pornography with smut, by which he meant to talk about sex that is truthful, idiosyncratic, and honest even about its own reason for being.<ref>http://denniscooper-theweaklings.blogspot.com/2008/11/billy-miller-christian-siekmeier-and.html?zx=95d9a097b9af8c9c, retrieved 2014-09-10</ref> Or as he put it elsewhere, "We articulate cocksucker values." <ref>"'We Articulate Cocksucker Values': Remembering the Sexual Revolution" p. 161-174 of  Chapter 4, "Queer Theory is Burning", pp. 145-174, of Christopher Castiglia and Christopher Reed, ''If Memory Serves: Gay Men, AIDS, and the Promise of the Queer Past'', University of Minnesota Press, 2012, ISBN 9780816676101. An earlier version of this chapter was published by Christopher Castiglia "Past Burning: the (Post)Traumatic Criss of (Post-)Queer Theory", in ''States of Emergency'', ed. Russ Castronovo and Susan Gillman, University of North Carolina Press, 2009, ISBN 0807859850, pp. 69-87.</ref>

McDonald was a pornographer with a politics:
<blockquote> We do not advocate the overthrow of the American Government. Johnson and Nixon and Reagan, and their millions of followers, have always seen to that. They have South Americanized America.... We support the minority of American men who are decent, like Ramsey Clark, Ralph Nader and Daniel Ellsberg.
</blockquote>

This led him to publish, among many reader-contributed photos, one of President Reagan in his underwear.<ref>.http://archive.guidemag.com/magcontent/invokemagcontent.cfm?ID=9C47C01B-83FD-4A0D-831BD7F31715EB1D, retrieved 2014-09-02</ref> McDonald also had a philosophy:
<blockquote> "Straights" have a surface charm that comes from their membership in the overpowering sexual majority. This gives them a certain fearlessness that passes for masculinity. But at heart they are too timid and terrified of homosexuality to be of any real interest. Only men with balls dare to be different.
</blockquote>

or as he puts it elsewhere: "''Straight to Hell'' is not for the upward striving middle class but for guys who like to go down."<ref>All of these quotes from his introductionn, "Love and Hate for the American Straight", to ''Flesh''. True Homosexual Experiences from S.T.H., Volume 2. Gay Sunshine Press, 1982. ISBN 0917342917, p. 9.</ref>

"Although primarily marketed and sold as pornography, McDonald saw his work as a kind of history of the homosexual experience. A Harvard graduate, McDonald compared his work favorably to the work of the great sex researchers, saying 'Compared to ''Meat'', Kinsey is just spam'."<ref>Daniel Hendrickson, "Boyd McDonald", ''Routledge International Encyclopedia of Queer Culture'', ed. David A. Gerstner, Routledge, ))))  p. 386 ISBN   http://books.google.com/books?id=851qoMjA3icC&pg=PA387&lpg=PA387&dq=%22boyd+McDonald%22+%22straight+to+hell%22&source=bl&ots=vhoNDvTH2_&sig=ag27Sm-p-K1yVyrdB8rVhxujUQs&hl=en&sa=X&ei=UHMHVOWVJpG8ggSW6YLwAw&ved=0CDUQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&q=%22boyd%20McDonald%22%20&f=false, retrieved 2014-09-10</ref>
"McDonald insisted that what he printed was not pornography, which for him meant the trite, self-conscious fantasies generated by guilt and timidity that were increasingly available in the 1970s and '80s through an increasingly commercial salacious press. He published The Truth, in a manner of a crusading journalist - a photographer without a camera - with the serious intention of assembling documentation of homosexual sex in its "classical" age, 1940-1980. The result is a kind of oral (as well as anal and genital) history, taking the reader into terrain at once strange and familiar: the unacknowledged corners of life where repression is not lifted, but exploded to bits. In contrast to pornographic fantasy, the meaning of every scene, scent and sensation in McDonald placed before his eager public is simply that, however american life has been represented in the official organs backed by business, state, and religion, such things actually do happen.... Through the sheer abundance of true stories, McDonald presents a picture of homosexual sex as a nearly universal male experience, in pointed contrast to the contemporary ideology of homosexuality as special identity. In the world of the S.T.H. book, every barracks shower is an orgy room; every Boy Scout jamboree is a festival of sexual initiation; every conservative politician and clergyman pays male hustlers for sex. Everything men do to bond or compete in sports, war and politics is a sublimation of, if not a substitute for, homosexual desire."<ref>Bernard Welt, "One Man's Desire", text accompanying the exhibition at Exile (see below) November 7, 2008, retrieved 2014-09-10</ref>


Boyd McDonald was mentioned as a prominent figure in the golden age of gay literature by Felice Picano.<ref>Catherine Texier, "Gay Lit's Golden Age", ''New York Times Book Review'', December 2, 2007, http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/02/books/review/Texier-t.html?module=Search&mabReward=relbias%3Ar&_r=0, retrieved 2010-09-02</ref> John Waters has also expressed his enthusiasm.<ref>Trey Speegle, "Picture This: Andy Warhol Shot My Dirty T-Shirt", http://worldofwonder.net/graphic-t-shirts-art/, retrieved 2014-09-10, and elsewhere.</ref> He is discussed at length by Reed Woodhouse in ''Unlimited Embrace: A Canon of Gay Fiction, 1945-1995''.<ref>University of Massachusetts Press, 1998, ISBN 1558491325. McDonald is discussed on pp. 62-73, in the chapter "Sexual Dandyism and The Legacy of Oscar Wilde".</ref> McDonald is the only non-fiction author Woodhouse deals with.

Gore Vidal once described STH as "one of the best radical papers in the country."<ref>David Bateman, "Cum-dripping fun", ''Daily Xtra'' [Canada], January 17, 2007, http://dailyxtra.com/toronto/news/cum-dripping-fun, retrieved 2014-09-07</ref>

The San Francisco gay bookstore A Different Light held "Straight to Hell: A Night of Readings from the Cum-Drenched Pages of S.T.H." The poster announcing the reading, on Saturday, November 26, has been preserved<ref>http://denniscooper-theweaklings.blogspot.com/2008/11/billy-miller-christian-siekmeier-and.html?zx=95d9a097b9af8c9c, retrieved 2010-09-08. November 26 was a Saturday in 1988, 1994, and 2005; from the names of the authors participating, it seems most likely that it was in 2005.</ref> 

From 2001 to 2005 over 200 fan messages were posed on a group, described as "A place for fans of Boyd McDonald's seminal work, Straight To Hell, The Manhattan Review of Unnatural Acts", which existed on Yahoo Groups Canada (https://ca.groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/Straight_To_Hell/info, retrieved 2014-09-04). After 2005 the group was taken over by unrelated spam.
