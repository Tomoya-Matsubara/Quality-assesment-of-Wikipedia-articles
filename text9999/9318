"'''Amazed'''" is a song written by [[Marv Green]], [[Aimee Mayo]], and [[Chris Lindsey]]. The first version of the song was recorded by the American [[country music]] group [[Lonestar]], whose version was released in March 1999 as the second single from their 1999 album ''[[Lonely Grill]]''. Lonestar's version is their longest-lasting Number One single and biggest hit, spending eight weeks at the top of the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country chart. A remix later reached the top of the [[Billboard Hot 100]] and No. 2 on the [[Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks]] charts as well. Since the release of the original, the song has been covered by [[Bonnie Tyler]], [[Duncan James]], and [[Fady Maalouf]], all of whom have released their respective versions as singles. [[Ben Mills]], [[Boyz II Men]] and [[Shane Filan]] have included covers in their respective albums. 

On [[The Sing-Off]] (season 4, episode 3), judge [[Shawn Stockman]], of [[Boyz II Men]] fame, mentioned that the song had been offered to them first, and they decided to turn it down.

"Amazed" was the last country-classified song to hit Number One on the [[Billboard Hot 100]] until the week of September 1, 2012, when "[[We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together]]" by [[Taylor Swift]] climbed from No. 72 to No. 1.

==Content==
"Amazed" is in the key of [[A-flat major|A<U+266D> major]] with a vocal range from F3 to A<U+266D>4.<ref>{{cite book|title=Contemporary Country|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|year=1999|edition=1|pages=4<U+2013>8|accessdate=August 10, 2009}} The [[sheet music]] is in [[A major]], with a note that the song is recorded a [[semitone]] lower than written.</ref>

==Lonestar version==
Lonestar's rendition is the second single from their 1999 album ''[[Lonely Grill]]''. The song spent eight consecutive weeks at No. 1 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs|Hot Country Singles & Tracks]] chart that same year. With this accomplishment, it set a record for the longest run at Number One on the country chart since [[Nielsen Broadcast Data Systems]] was initiated in 1990. This run was later tied by [[Alan Jackson]]'s and [[Jimmy Buffett]]'s 2003 single "[[It's Five O'Clock Somewhere (song)|It's Five O'Clock Somewhere]]", which spent eight non-consecutive weeks at Number One. "Amazed" spent 41 weeks on the country singles chart,<ref name="whitburn">{{cite book|last=Whitburn|first=Joel|title=Hot Country Songs 1944 to 2008|publisher=Record Research, Inc|year=2008|pages=244|isbn=0-89820-177-2|accessdate=October 6, 2009}}</ref> giving it the second-longest chart run of any country single in the 1990s.<ref>Whitburn, p. 644</ref> In addition, the single crossed over into the pop airwaves entering the [[Billboard Hot 100]] at No. 81. It peaked at No. 24 on before falling off the Hot 100. It had sold 900,000 copies in the US as of April 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://new.music.yahoo.com/blogs/chart_watch/74350/chart-watch-extra-lady-a-makes-country-history/|title=Chart Watch Extra: Lady A Makes Country History|author=Paul Grein|date=April 7, 2011|work=|publisher=yahoo!|accessdate=April 19, 2011}}</ref>

"Amazed" was then [[remix]]ed for pop radio (a tactic commonly used to present country-leaning songs to mainstream audiences) and the new mix's popularity prompted the single to re-enter the Hot 100 at No. 45. On this second chart run, it hit No. 1 on March 4. In doing so, it became the first country song to top the pop charts since [[Dolly Parton]]'s and [[Kenny Rogers]]' 1983 duet "[[Islands in the Stream (song)|Islands in the Stream]]".<ref>{{cite book|last=Bronson|first=Fred|title=Billboard's Hottest Hot 100 Hits|pages=396|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=mEIfDZtsVyAC&pg=PA396&lpg=PA396&dq=amazed+hot+100&source=web&ots=VwNEtCzwbi&sig=MGsYQa3uJ3s98ckRi-YjtE6QaRg|isbn=978-0-8230-7738-0|year=2003|publisher=Billboard Books}}</ref> It also made Lonestar the first country band to place a song in the Top Ten of the Hot 100 year-end countdown. All remixes of the song made the single spend a combined total of 55 weeks in the Hot 100, and 41 weeks on Hot Country Singles & Tracks.

In the [[United Kingdom]], Lonestar's version of "Amazed" reached a peak of No. 21 and spent 22 weeks in the charts. It spent 17 weeks in the top 40 without ever breaking into the top 20.

==Music video==
[[Trey Fanjoy]] directed the [[music video]] for Lonestar's rendition. It was released in July 1999. It alternates between shots of the band performing the song in a dark room, and a model making seductive poses. The model is portrayed by the beautiful [[Sunny Mabrey]].
