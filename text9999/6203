Utley was a member of the First Congregational Church, a [[Freemasonry|Mason]], and a member of the [[Detroit Athletic Club]].<ref name=Burt/>

==Hotel Playa Ensenada==
In his later years, Utley was best known for his role as the owner of the Hotel Playa Ensenada, later re-named the [[Hotel Riviera del Pac<U+00ED>fico]].  The hotel was a luxury resort built in the late 1920s during [[Prohibition]], included a casino, and was located approximately 75 miles south of [[Tijuana]].  [[Jack Dempsey]], the world heavyweight boxing champion, was one of the original owners, and guests included [[Marion Davies]], [[William Randoph Hearst]], [[Johnny Weismuller]] and [[Myrna Loy]].  By 1931, the hotel's debt burden had become a problem, and Utley made a substantial investment in the hotel.<ref name=Hotel/><ref>{{cite news|title=Dempsey Planning to Reopen Mexican Resort|newspaper=The Hartford Courant|date=June 11, 1931|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/courant/access/820042762.html?dids=820042762:820042762&FMT=CITE&FMTS=CITE:AI&type=historic&date=Jun+11%2C+1931&author=&pub=Hartford+Courant&desc=Dempsey+Planning+to+Reopen+Mexican+Resort&pqatl=google}}</ref>  Following Utley's investment, the hotel's business dropped off, as Prohibition was repealed in the United States and gambling was outlawed in Mexico.
