'''Shahla Sherkat''' (born March 30, 1956 in [[Isfahan (city)|Isfahan]], [[Iran]]) is a [[journalist]], prominent [[Iranian people|Persian]] [[feminist]] author, and one of the pioneers of [[Women's rights movement in Iran]].  

Shahla Sherkat is founder and publisher of ''[[Zanan magazine]]'' (''zanan'' means "women"), which focuses on the concerns of [[Iranian women]] and continually tests the political waters with its edgy coverage of everything from reform politics to domestic abuse to sex. ''Zanan'' has been the most important Iranian women's journal after Iranian revolution.

Sherkat has had to appear in court on several occasions when Zanan's content was considered to be pushing boundaries too far. In 2001 she was sentenced to four months in prison for attending a [['Iran After the Elections' Conference|conference in Berlin]] at which the future of politics in Iran was discussed following the success of reformist candidates in a parliamentary election. 

Sherkat holds a bachelor<U+2019>s degree in [[psychology]] from [[Tehran University]] and a certificate in [[journalism]] from Keyhan Institute, also in Tehran. Since 2002, she has been working towards her master<U+2019>s degree in women<U+2019>s studies from Allameh Tabatabai University.
