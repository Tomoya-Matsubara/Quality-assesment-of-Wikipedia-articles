'''Handsfree''' is an adjective describing equipment that can be used without the use of hands (for example via voice commands) or, in a wider sense, equipment which needs only limited use of hands, or for which the controls are positioned so that the hands are able to occupy themselves with another task (such as [[Mobile phones and driving safety|driving]]) without needing to hunt far afield for the controls.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/04/arts/television/04kinect.html New York Times]</ref><ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/23/technology/personaltech/23smart.html New York Times]</ref><ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/18/technology/personaltech/18smart.html New York Times]</ref>

Devices that are typically used for handsfree communication use [[Bluetooth]] as its wireless technology. They still require a mobile phone or other device to initiate a call. These devices include Bluetooth headsets, hands-free car kits (HFCK), and personal navigation devices (PND). Originally introduced as optional features connected by a wire to mobile phones or other communication devices, they now generally are available with wireless technology. 

Bluetooth handsfree options are now also easily found in any high end automotive as part of the vehicle's stereo system, or in after market stereo system units. This option utilizes the vehicle's speakers to transmit the caller's voice in the phone call and have an embedded microphone in the stereo unit itself, the steering wheel, or use a separate wired microphone that can be placed anywhere in the vehicle.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/22/automobiles/22BLUETOOTH.html New York Times]</ref>

Handsfree [[mobile phone]]s are obligatory in many countries for use of a mobile phone while driving. However, studies have shown that even with a hands-free unit, the added distraction to the driver, and the increase in accident rates, are almost as substantial as when driving and talking on a normal mobile phone.<ref>[http://web.utah.edu/unews/releases/05/feb/cellphones.html Cell Phone Users Drive Like Old Folks - Driving to Distraction: How the New Study was Performed] (from the [[University of Utah]])</ref>

In the [[United Kingdom]], as of 2003, it is [[law|illegal]] to use a handheld mobile phone while driving.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2003/20032695.htm | title=The Road Vehicles (Construction and Use) (Amendment) (No. 4) Regulations 2003 | work=Office of Public Sector Information | date=20 October 2003 | accessdate=2006-09-27}}</ref> Similar laws have been adopted in many jurisdictions worldwide, and many make provisions for hands-free phone use.

Installation of hands-free devices in the UK is governed by MPT 1362, which is now referred to as FCS 1362. A technical document created and updated by the Federation of Communication Services.

In the [[USA]], several [[Restrictions on cell phone use by US drivers|states have banned]] talking on a hand-held cellphone while driving.

== Software technologies ==
Since handsfree devices replace a phone's own [[Loudspeaker|speaker]] and [[microphone]] capability in a phone call, they now also must deal with the same issues that standard mobile phones and land phones deal with.  The main acoustic issues are [[echo cancellation]] and noise suppression, although there are others as well. There have been many ways developed to cancel echo in phone calls and results range from poor to excellent. 

These acoustic technologies must also remove or reduce the noise levels so that the caller is well understood. A person making a call from a handsfree device who is in a busy restaurant or while driving will introduce large levels of noise into the call. This situation is complicated as the software must not only remove the noise around him, but must transmit his voice clearly and loudly to whoever is connected to him. 

The best software solutions combine both echo cancellation and noise cancellation into a single technology so that the caller has the freedom to use a handsfree device anywhere they please.  Having an acoustic solution with only one feature will dramatically reduce its flexibility.
