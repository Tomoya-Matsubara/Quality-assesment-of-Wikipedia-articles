'''''Zephyr''''' is a [[public sculpture]] created by artist Steve Wooldridge in 1998. It is located southeast of the [[Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis]] (IUPUI) University Library and north of New York Street on [[Indiana_University-Purdue_University_Indianapolis#Campus|IUPUI's campus]]. The overall dimensions of this [[stainless steel]] sculpture are {{convert|13|ft|m}} tall, {{convert|2|ft|m}} long, and {{convert|10|ft|m}} wide.

==Description==
''Zephyr'' is composed of several different three-dimensional geometric shapes, all made of [[stainless steel]]. Its base is a rectangle that measures {{convert|3|ft|m}} tall and {{convert|2|ft|m}} wide. Next are two cylinders lying on their sides with a north/south orientation. They each have a diameter of {{convert|8.5|in|cm}} and a length of {{convert|17|in|cm}}. On top of the cylinders is a right triangle that measures {{convert|4|ft|m}} tall and {{convert|20|in|cm}} on the shortest side. It lies at an angle so that the right angle rests between the two cylinders. A third cylinder rests on top of the triangle and it measures {{convert|6.5|in|cm}} in diameter and {{convert|1.5|ft|cm}} long. On top of this cylinder and the triangle is a large hoop with a diameter of approximately {{convert|7|ft|m}}. There is a {{convert|10|ft|m}} pole going through the hoop from the proper bottom right to the proper top left. It passes behind the hoop on the proper left and in front of the hoop on the proper right, where a semi-hollow cylinder with a diameter of {{convert|1|ft|cm}} and a length of {{convert|10|in|cm}} rests.

"Steve E. Wooldridge",  "1998", and "Zephyr" are visible on the metal next to the proper right side of the base.

==Information ==
"[[Anemoi#West wind (Zephyrus)|Zephyr]]" means "west wind" and is also the name of a [[Pioneer Zephyr|pioneer streamlined]] [[locomotive]], dating to the 1930s. Each of the eight geometric shapes has a meaning. The rectangular base represents the core of education.<ref name = "IUPUI">{{cite web |url=http://www.iupui.edu/tour/map.php?tour_id=12  |title=IUPUI Virtual Tour: Art. |year= 2009 |work= |publisher=iupui.edu |accessdate= November 25, 2009 }}</ref> The two side-by-side cylinders represent the wheels of progress while the triangle represents a mode of transportation designed for speed. The small cylinder that supports the hoop signifies fortitude and determination and the hoop itself stands for the circle of life. The long pole represents ambition and the hollow scroll stands for the scroll of knowledge. The artist dedicated the sculpture to today's youth.<ref name = "IUPUI"/>

===Acquisition===
The [[Indiana University]] Board of Trustees approved the decision to keep the ''Zephyr'' sculpture on the IUPUI campus permanently at their January 28, 2005 meeting. Prior to this it had been on loan to the university for two years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://webapp1.dlib.indiana.edu/iubot/view?docId=2005-01-28.xml&doc.view=print&toc.depth=1&toc.id=0&brand=iubot  |title=Minutes of the Board of Trustees of Indiana University, Indiana University Purdue University Indianapolis: January 28, 2005.  |date= January 28, 2005 |work= |publisher=indiana.edu |accessdate= November 25, 2009 }}</ref>

== Documentation ==
A [[Museum Studies]] course at IUPUI recently undertook the project of researching and reporting on the condition of 40 outdoor sculptures on the university campus. ''Zephyr'' was included in this movement.<ref name="Chronicle">{{cite web | author=Mary Helen Miller | date=April 4, 2010 | title=Scholars Use Wikipedia to Save Public Art From the Dustbin of History | work=The Chronicle of Higher Education | publisher= | url= http://chronicle.com/article/Scholars-Use-Wikipedia-to-Save/64929/|accessdate= July 7, 2010}}</ref> This documentation was influenced by the successful [[Save Outdoor Sculpture!]] 1989 campaign organized by Heritage Preservation: The National Institute of Conservation partnered with the [[Smithsonian Institution]], specifically the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]]. Throughout the 1990s, over 7,000 volunteers nationwide have cataloged and assessed the condition of over 30,000 publicly accessible statues, monuments, and sculptures installed as outdoor public art across the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.heritagepreservation.org/Programs/Sos/aboutsos.htm  |title=About SOS! |author=  |year= 2009 |work= |publisher=heritagepreservation.org |accessdate= November 25, 2009 }}</ref>
