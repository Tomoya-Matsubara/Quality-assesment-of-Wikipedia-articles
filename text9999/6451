The '''2012 Michoac<U+00E1>n murder of photographers''' concerns two Mexican freelance photographers, Arturo Barajas L<U+00F3>pez (1966? - 19 August 2012) and Jos<U+00E9> Antonio Aguilar Mota (1986? - 19 August 2012), who were kidnapped on 16 August 2012 and found murdered in Ecuandureo, [[Michoac<U+00E1>n]], [[Mexico]].  The two photojournalists worked in an area that is known for narcotics trafficking and could have been targeted because of their employment as freelance journalists who sometimes photographed accident scenes for the local newspaper. <ref name=foxnews>{{cite web|url=http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/news/2012/08/20/bodies-2-photographers-found-in-western-mexico/ |title=Bodies of 2 Photographers Found Inside Car Trunk in Mexico &#124; Fox News Latino |publisher=Latino.foxnews.com |date=2012-08-20 |accessdate=2012-11-28}}</ref>

== Career ==
Barajas, 46, and Lopez, 26, were both freelance photographers who were often seen offering their services in the plaza in the town of [[Zamora]] and also to the Zamora Valley Press Association.  Barajas had also photographed accident scenes and drug-related crimes for the ''[[Diaro de Zamora]]'' newspaper.  They were not, however, members of the press organization.<ref name=foxnews /><ref name=sinembargo>{{cite web|url=http://www.sinembargo.mx/20-08-2012/339166 |title=Aparecen muertos y con marcas de tortura dos periodistas de Michoac<U+00E1>n; van 74 en el sexenio de FCH &#124; Sin Embargo |publisher=Sinembargo.mx |date=2012-08-20 |accessdate=2012-11-28}}</ref>
