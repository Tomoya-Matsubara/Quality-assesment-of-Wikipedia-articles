{{Politics of Trinidad and Tobago}}
The '''National Alliance for Reconstruction''' (NAR) was the governing [[political party|party]] in [[Trinidad and Tobago]] between [[1986]] and [[1991]].  It was founded in [[1986]] out of an accommodation between the National Alliance (consisting of the [[United Labour Front]] led by [[Basdeo Panday]], the [[Democratic Action Congress]] led by [[A. N. R. Robinson|A.N.R. Robinson]] and the [[Tapia House Movement]] led by [[Lloyd Best]]) and the [[Organisation for National Reconstruction]] (led by [[Karl Hudson-Phillips]].)  The party defeated the ruling [[People's National Movement]] in the [[Elections in Trinidad and Tobago#1986 General Elections|1986 elections]], winning 33 of the 36 seats in the national [[Parliament of Trinidad and Tobago|Parliament]].

==Pre-1986==
Hudson-Phillips did not take a major role in the NAR government (according to [[Basdeo Panday]] this was because of animosity between Hudson-Phillips and [[A. N. R. Robinson|A.N.R. Robinson]], the "compromise" leader of the NAR).  He went on the lead the prosecution of the [[Maurice Bishop]] murder trial, and is now a judge of the [[International Criminal Court]].  Rambachan served as [[Ambassador]] to [[Brazil]] and now serves as [[United National Congress]] [[Mayor]] of [[Chaguanas]].  Several other ONR members held prominent posts in the NAR government.  After the fall of the NAR many of them made their way to the UNC, while others returned to the PNM. Dr. Robert Maharaj formerly of the ONR is credited with much of the effort of amalgamating opposition parties to aid in the formation of the ANR for the 1986 general elections, a prominent medical doctor of San Fernando, who later emigrated to Ireland with his wife and two children. Dr. Robert Maharaj of Princes Town and later of St. Joseph Village, San Fernando is close relative of Ramesh Lawrence Maharaj. Dr. Robert Maharaj's grandfather and Ramesh Lawrence Maharaj's father were brothers of the same Maharaj family

With the merger of the ONR,ULF, DAC and TAPIA into the NAR, Robinson was chosen as Political Leader, with Panday and Hudson Phillips as his two Deputy Leaders

==1986-1991==
The NAR  entered government with broad national support and good will, but support declined as fiscal austerity and neo-liberal economic policies imposed by the [[International Monetary Fund]]'s Structural Adjustment Program resulted in increased unemployment and a 10% cut in salaries in the public service.  In [[1990]] the [[Jamaat al Muslimeen]] attempted to capitalise on the dissatisfaction with an attempted ''[[coup d'<U+00E9>tat]]''.  (See [[Jamaat al Muslimeen coup attempt]]).

In [[1988]] the party split with six MP's (Panday and five other former ULF members) forming the [[United National Congress]]. Subsequently a further five MPs defected to the [[Independent (politician)|Independent]] benches. Despite surviving the attempted coup the NAR was defeated in the [[Elections in Trinidad and Tobago#1991 General Elections|1991 General Elections]], winning only two seats.

==1991-1995==
Following this defeat Robinson resigned as Leader. Many prominent NAR members also went into "political retirement" at this time leaving the NAR severely weakened. In the 1992 Local Government Elections the NAR suffered another humiliating defeat not winning a single seat (though winning 11% of the vote). The NAR did however retain its dominance in the Tobago House of Assembly holding 11 of 12 seats in the 1992 THA elections. This however confirmed to many that the NAR was no longer a national party capable of winning elections, but a minor party supported only by Tobagonians.

The NAR went through rapid leadership changes. Former Works Minister, [[Carson Charles]] served as leader from 1992-1993. He was replaced by former Finance Minister Selby Wilson. Charles left the NAR and formed his own group the [[National Development Party]]. In a 1994 by-election an attempt was made to have the NAR and its two daughter parties the UNC and NDP, run a joint platform. Proposals to reunite the NAR came to naught however. The UNC was adopting a policy of attracting 'NAR voters' directly rather than attempting another formal alliance. Following his failure to reunite the party Wilson resigned and the NAR was leaderless until just prior to the 1995  General Elections. During this period NAR chairman Robert Mayers served as the de facto leader. When elections were called in 1995 Robinson was persuaded to return  and resume leadership of the party. At the same time though several persons who had previously campaigned on NAR tickets, contested the 1995 election on the UNC slate (Ganga Singh, Kamla Persad Bissessar, Mervyn Assam).

==1995-2000==
The NAR  retained its two Tobago seats in the [[1995]] general elections and entered government as junior partner to the United National Congress which had seventeen seats. Together both parties had a bare majority in the thirty-six seat Parliament.  Robinson was appointed Minister Extraordinaire and was elected President in 1997. Former Speaker of the House Nizam Mohammed replaced him as NAR leader. 

However the NAR continued to weaken and fracture. Its bargaining position was reduced when two PNM (People's National Movement) MPs defected and joined the government as Independents. In the 1996 THA elections a NAR assemblywoman, Deborah Moore-Miggins, contested as an Independent and won. Later two other NAR assemblymen defected and joined her in forming the [[People's Empowerment Party (Trinidad and Tobago)]].  

During the 1996 Local Government elections the NAR contested approximately 1/3 of the 124 seats while the UNC contested the other 2/3. Most of the seats contested by the NAR however were PNM strongholds, where the NAR had little support. Even in places like Arima where the NAR could potentially have won, independent candidates split the vote, leading to PNM victories. The NAR won no seats and accused the UNC of supporting these independents, deliberately preventing the NAR from regaining representation in Trinidad. 

NAR control overs its two MPs in the National Parliament was reduced. One, Morgan Job (who had taken over Robinson's seat) frequently sided with the UNC against the NAR leadership. The other was increasing friendly with the PEP and eventually became an Independent. 

Feeling itself used and ignored by its coalition partner the NAR withdrew from government, though its MPs remained in the UNC-led government. Mohammed did not seek reelection and former Attorney General Anthony Smart became the new NAR leader in 1999.

The NAR won only a single seat in the [[Elections in Trinidad and Tobago#2000 General Elections|2000 elections]] and found itself back in opposition.

==2001-2006==
In the 2001 THA election the NAR found itself in a four-way battle. NAR Tobago leader Hochoy Charles was a controversial figure. Accusations of autocratic, corrupt and incompetent governance had led to the formation of the PEP, composed of younger rebel NARites. The UNC was also making a first ever foray into Tobago politics and was backed by the power of being in Government.  However it was their traditional adversaries, the PNM who proved the undoing of the Tobago NAR. The NAR won only four seats and the PNM assumed control of the THA.

General elections  were called early as a result of a split in the UNC. The NAR executive wished to ally with the UNC rebels, dubbed [[National Team Unity]]. Smart however was opposed to allying with NTU leader [[Ramesh Maharaj]]. Overruled by the executive he resigned. Lennox Sankersingh was elected to replace him.  The NAR entered into an electoral arrangement with the NTU whereby the NAR contested six and the NTU thirty seats. Unfortunately neither parties won any seats in the [[Elections in Trinidad and Tobago#2001 General Elections|2001 elections]].  

The NAR suffered a further loss in [[2004]] when a portion of the [[Tobago]] wing of the party led by [[Hochoy Charles]] split away from the NAR and re-formed the DAC. This reduced the NAR representation in the THA to two seats.

An attempt to ally with the Citizen's Alliance (led by former PNM Finance Minister [[Wendell Mottley]]) prove fruitless and at the last [[Elections in Trinidad and Tobago#2002 General Elections|General Elections]], on [[October 7]], [[2002]], the party won only 1.1% of popular votes and no seats. Afterwards the NAR contested the 2003 Local Government Elections with an arrangement with the UNC. The NAR contest 19 seats  but won none. Sankersingh was however appointed an alderman of the UNC controlled Couva/Tabaquite/Talparo Regional Corporation.  The NAR lost its last representatives in the [[Tobago House of Assembly]] in the January [[2005]] elections. Just prior to that election that majority of the Tobago NAR membership (including its two remaining Assemblymen) defected to the DAC. The NAR was only able to field two candidates and attracted a measly 0.01% of the vote.

At present the party has no representation in either the National Parliament or the Tobago House of Assembly. It has no elected Local Government representatives and has a single appointed alderman. At its 2005 Party Convention less than a hundred members attended. At that meeting  [[Carson Charles]], who had returned to the party, was elected Political Leader.

==2007==
The party didn't take part in the [[5 November]] [[2007]] [[House of Representatives of Trinidad and Tobago|parliamentary]] [[Trinidad and Tobago general election, 2007|elections].
