"'''Bollocks'''" {{IPAc-en|<U+02C8>|b|<U+0252>|l|<U+0259>|k|s}} is a word of [[Middle English]] origin, meaning "[[testicles]]". The word is often used figuratively in [[English language|British English]] and [[Hiberno-English]] as a noun to mean "nonsense", an expletive following a minor accident or misfortune, or an adjective to mean "poor quality" or "useless". Similarly, the common phrases "''Bollocks'' to this!" or "That's a load of old ''bollocks''" generally indicate [[contempt]] for a certain task, subject or opinion. Conversely, the word also figures in idiomatic phrases such as "the dog's ''bollocks''", "top ''bollock(s)''", or more simply "the ''bollocks''" (as opposed to just "''bollocks''"), which will refer to something which is admired, approved of or well-respected.{{efn-ua|Dog<U+2019>s bollocks has been naturally extended "sometimes for decorum<U+2019>s sake, and refer to the 'mutt<U+2019>s nuts,' the 'puppy<U+2019>s privates,' or... 'badger<U+2019>s nadgers.'"<ref name="McAlpine"/>}}

==Etymology==

The word has a long and distinguished history, with the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (OED) giving examples of its usage dating back to the 13th century. One of the early references is [[Wycliffe's Bible|John Wycliffe bible]] (1382), [[Leviticus]] xxii, 24: "Al beeste, that ... kitt and taken a wey the ''ballokes'' is, ye shulen not offre to the Lord..." (any beast that is cut and taken away the ''bollocks'', you shall not offer to the Lord, ''i.e.'' [[castration|castrated]] animals are not suitable as sacrifices).

The OED states (with abbreviations expanded): "Probably a derivative of [[Proto-Germanic|Teutonic]] ''ball-'', of which the Old English representative would be inferred as ''beall-u'', ''-a'', or ''-e''".

The Teutonic ''ball-'' in turn probably derives from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] base ''*bhel-'', to inflate or swell. This base also forms the root of many other words, including "[[phallus]]".

===Meaning "nonsense"===
From the seventeenth to the nineteenth century, ''bollocks'' or ''ballocks'' was allegedly used as a slang term for a clergyman, although this meaning is not mentioned by the OED's 1989 edition. For example, in 1864, the Commanding Officer of the Straits Fleet{{which|date=February 2015}} regularly referred to his chaplain as ''"Ballocks"''. It has been suggested that ''bollocks'' came to have its modern meaning of "[[nonsense]]" because clergymen were notorious for talking nonsense during their sermons.<ref>{{cite book

==Severity==
Originally, the word "bollocks" was the everyday vernacular word for testicles<U+2014>as noted above, it was used in this sense in the first English-language bible, in the 14th century. By the mid-seventeenth century, at least, it had begun to acquire coarse figurative meanings (see section on "bollocking"), for example in a translation of works by [[Rabelais]].

It did not appear in [[Samuel Johnson]]'s 1755 dictionary of the English language.<ref>*[http://www.archive.org/details/dictionaryofengl01johnuoft Downloadable copy of Johnson's Dictionary, 6th Edition, Volume 1] and [http://www.archive.org/details/dictionaryofengl02johnuoft Volume 2] at the Internet Archive</ref> It was also omitted from the 1933 [[Oxford English Dictionary]] and its 1941 reprint, finally appearing in the 1972 supplement.<ref>Melvin J. Lasky: ''The language of journalism: Profanity, obscenity and the media'', Aldine Transaction, 2007. ISBN 0-7658-0220-1, ISBN 978-0-7658-0220-0.  p.134</ref> The first modern English dictionary to include an entry for "bollocks" was G. N. Garmonsway's Penguin English Dictionary of 1965.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}<!--Several cites for it being the first dictionary to include "fuck". Still trying to find cite for bollocks-->

The relative severity of the various [[profanity|profanities]], as perceived by the British public, was studied on behalf of the [[Ofcom|Broadcasting Standards Commission]], [[Independent Television Commission]], [[BBC]] and [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]]. The results of this jointly commissioned research were published in December 2000 in a paper called "Delete Expletives?".<ref>[http://www.asa.org.uk/Resource-Centre/Reports-and-surveys.aspx ASA Reports and Surveys], ''Delete Expletives'' paper. Retrieved 19 March 2010.</ref> This placed "bollocks" in eighth position in terms of its perceived severity, between "prick" (seventh place) and "[[Asshole|arsehole]]" (ninth place).<ref>''Delete Expletives'', p.9</ref> By comparison, the word "balls" (which has some similar meanings) was down in 22nd place. Of the people surveyed, 25% thought that "bollocks" should not be broadcast at all, and only 11% thought that it could acceptably be broadcast at times before the national 9&nbsp;pm "[[watershed (television)|watershed]]" on television (radio does not have a watershed).<ref>''Delete Expletives'', p.28</ref> 25% of the people regarded "bollocks" as "very severe", 32% "quite severe", 34% "mild" and 8% considered it "not swearing".<ref>''Delete Expletives'', p.12</ref>

A survey of the language of London teenagers (published in 2002) examined, amongst other things, the incidence of various swearwords in their speech. It noted that the top ten swearwords make up 81% of the total swearwords. "Bollocks" was the seventh most frequent swearword, after "fucking", "shit", "fuck", "bloody", "hell" and "fuck off". Below "Bollocks" were "bastard", "bitch" and "damn", in eighth, ninth and tenth places.<ref>Anna-Brita Stenstr<U+00F6>m, Gisle Andersen and Ingrid Kristine Hasund: ''Trends in teenage talk: corpus compilation, analysis, and findings'', John Benjamins Publishing Company, 2002. ISBN 1-58811-252-7, ISBN 978-1-58811-252-1. p.80</ref> This research regarded these words as swearwords in the context of their usage but noted that some might be inoffensive in other contexts.<ref>Stenstr<U+00F6>m, Andersen and Hasund, p.76</ref>

==="Chuffed to one's bollocks"===
The phrase ''"chuffed to one's bollocks"'' describes someone who is very pleased with himself.  [[Nobel laureate]] [[Harold Pinter]] used this in ''[[The Homecoming]]''<ref>"He'll be ''chuffed to his bollocks'' in the morning when he sees his eldest son".</ref> The phrase provided a serious challenge to translators of his work.<ref>{{cite web

===Rhyming slang===
The [[rhyming slang]] for ''bollocks'' is "''[[Jackson Pollock]]s''".<ref>Eric Partridge, Tom Dalzell, Terry Victor, ''The New Partridge Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English'', Taylor & Francis, 2006, ISBN 0-415-25938-X, 9780415259385. p.1082</ref> It can be shortened to ''Jacksons'', as in "[[Modern art]]? Pile o' ''Jacksons'' if you ask me!". ''[[Sandra Bullock]]s'' is occasionally used to approximate rhyming slang; it does not quite rhyme, but preserves meter and [[rhythm]].  [[The Beautiful South]] [[bowdlerised]] their original line "''sweaty bollocks''" as "''Sandra Bullocks''", as one of several changes to make their song "Don't Marry Her" acceptable for mainstream radio play.

===="Horlicks"====
The term ''"Horlicks"'' was brought to prominence in July 2003, when then-[[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|British Foreign Secretary]] [[Jack Straw]] used it to describe irregularities in the preparation and provenance of the "[[dodgy dossier]]" regarding [[Iraq and weapons of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction in Iraq]].

This [[euphemism]] stems from an [[advertising campaign]] for the [[Horlicks]] [[malt]] drink, where people were seen to be shouting ''"Horlicks!"'' in a loud voice, to give vent to stress or frustration.

==Humour==
There is a strand of [[British humour]] which uses words that sound similar to ''"bollocks"'', or other slang words for testicles, for comic effect. An example would be "In [[Sarajevo]] in 1914, [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria]] was shot in ''[[the Balkans]]''".{{cite quote|date=January 2015}}

==Literature==

The play [[Sodom, or the Quintessence of Debauchery]], published in 1684 and ascribed to [[John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester]], includes a character named Bolloxinion, King of Sodom (along with other characters with names such as General Buggeranthos and the maid of honour, Fuckadilla). The word ''bollox'' appears several times in the text, such as:
:"Had all mankind, whose pintles I adore,
:With well fill'd bollox swiv'd me o'er and o'er.
:None could in nature have oblig'd me more."<ref>Earl John Wilmot: ''Sodom; Or the Quintessence of Debauchery'', Act IV, published 1684. Reprinted by Olympia Press, 2004

In 1690, the publisher Benjamin Crayle was fined 20 pounds and sent to prison for his part in publishing the play.<ref>[http://www.eroticabibliophile.com/censorship_history.php The Obscenity of Censorship: A History of Indecent People and Lacivious Publications] Sheryl Straight, 2003.

==Obscenity court ruling==
Perhaps the best-known use of the term is in the title of the 1977 [[punk rock]] album ''[[Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols]]''. Testimony in a resulting prosecution over the term demonstrated that in [[Old English]], the word referred to a priest, and could also be used to mean "nonsense". Defence [[barrister]] [[John Mortimer]] [[Queen's Counsel|QC]] and [[Virgin Records]] won the case: the court ruled that the word was not [[obscene]].<ref name="times251177">{{cite news |url= http://archive.timesonline.co.uk/tol/viewArticle.arc?pageId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1977-11-25-02&articleId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1977-11-25-02-012  |title=Record sleeve of punk rock album ruled not indecent |newspaper=[[The Times]]  |date=25 November 1977  |page=2  |accessdate=4 December 2010 }}</ref>  It just means "put aside all of that other rubbish and pay attention to this."<ref name="McAlpine"/>

Tony Wright, a [[Leicestershire]] trader, was given an <U+00A3>80 fixed penalty fine by police for selling T-shirts bearing the slogan "''Bollocks to [[Tony Blair|Blair]]''". This took place on 29 June 2006 at the Royal Norfolk Show; the police issued the penalty notice, quoting  Section 5 of the [[Public Order Act 1986]] which refers to language "deemed to cause harassment, alarm or distress".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/leicestershire/5135150.stm |title=UK &#124; England &#124; Leicestershire &#124; Man fined for 'rude' Blair shirt |publisher=BBC News |date=30 June 2006 |accessdate=2010-02-14}}</ref>

}}Mr Rhodes said: "The word <U+2018>bollocks<U+2019> has come to mean rubbish. It certainly doesn<U+2019>t have the same shock value that it might have had when the Sex Pistols first used it on an album."</ref> pointing to some of the statements made by John Mortimer QC: "What sort of country are we living in if a politician comes to [[Nottingham]] and speaks here to a group of people in the city centre and, during his speech, a heckler replies ''"bollocks"''. Are we to expect this person to be incarcerated, or do we live in a country where we are proud of our [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] language?".
